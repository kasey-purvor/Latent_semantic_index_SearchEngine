All the particles\nwere synthesised in-house.

All the nanofluids showed shear thinning behaviour within this range and the\nviscosities increased with the increase of concentrations of nanoparticles and with the\ndecrease of particle size. The highest increase of viscosity was found to be caused by\nnickel particles in silicone oil due to the formation of Ni network.\nKeywords: magnetic nanoparticle, ferroelectric nanoparticles, rheology, silicone oil, Fluorinert, nanofluid\n1. Introduction\nNanofluids specifically are dilute liquid suspensions of nanoparticles with at least one of\ntheir critical dimensions smaller than 100 nm [1] and are becoming more prominent in\nmany areas of current technology. For example, in bio-separations, magnetic\nnanoparticles coated with a target-specific surface capture targets in fluids, and then are\nseparated from the sample using a magnetic field [2]. Magnetic nanofluids offer a gentle\nalternative for the specific cells and molecules purification without damaging the cells\nand molecules. Apart from bio-separations, magnetic nanofluids can also be used in\nhyperthermia treatment, drug delivery and medical diagnostics [2, 3], rechargeable\nbatteries [4], conducting paints [5], magnetic recording media, ferro-fluids and magnetic\nresonance imaging contrast enhancement [6]. Barium titanate (BaTiO3) is an electro-\nactive material, and has been widely applied to electronic industries and electro-ceramics\n2industry [7, 8]. Nanofluids are under scrutiny for their heat transfer, mass transfer,\nwetting and spreading and antibacterial activity [1, 9]. These properties of nanofluids\nhave enormous potential for improvements in various industrial sectors, such as,\nchemical and process, medical, environment and energy [9].\nVery small volume fractions of nanoparticles suspended in a carrier fluid have\nbeen observed to produce quite remarkable increases in macroscopic properties, such as,\nthermal conductivity and dc electrical conductivity [1, 10]. The most published works on\nnanofluids deal with the heat transfer behaviours [2, 11-15], which have been reviewed\nby Keblinski et al. [16] and Das et al. [12]. There have been relatively few reports on the\nrheological behaviour of nanofluids [9, 17-20] although a number of rheological studies\non suspensions and\/or colloids can be found in literature. In general, nanofluids could\nperhaps be regarded as a special category of colloids, in which low solids loading but\nwith high enhancement and stability in rheological properties is key requirement.\nThe study of rheological properties of nanofluids has attracted interests of many\nacademia and industries [21-23] because it can result in many new industrial applications.\nFor example, in order to improve the inkjet process in direct-write technologies which\nallow the simplification of device manufacturing which has mainly depended upon an\nexpensive photolithography for the patterning [21], understanding the rheological\ncharacteristics of inks such as shear thinning effects, viscoelastic property, and particle\nmigration is necessary; the addition of a small relatively small fraction of nanoparticles to\npolymers, forming nanocomposites, has been noticed to induce a possible dramatic\nimprovements of polymer properties [22-23]. Successfully making use of these materials\n3depends upon a firm understanding of both their mechanical and rheological properties\n[22].\nAs a follow-up to our earlier work on nanofluids [10], in which we investigated\nthe effect of nanoparticles dispersed in non-polar media (silicone oil and FC70 fluid) on\nthe dc electrical conductivity of nanofluids, the aim of the present study is to achieve a\nmore fundamental understanding of the rheological behaviour of the same nanofluids and\nto assess the effects of the quantity of incorporated magnetic and piezoelectric ceramic\nnanoparticles, particle type and size on the rheological properties of two non-polar media.\n2. Experimental\nA range of different particle types and sizes were synthesised in our laboratories for use\nin this study, which ensured that the particles used were in their \u2018pure\u2019 form and free\nfrom surface reagents, such as organic surfactants, which might sometimes be found on\nparticles purchased from commercial suppliers. Our intension of not adding surface\nreagents to nanofluids to prevent the agglomeration of particles is because this allows us\nto observe the interactions between nanoparticles and their influence on the rheological\nbehaviours of the base fluids.\n2.1 Nanoparticle synthesis and sample preparation\nThe viscosities of six different nanofluid systems (representing combinations of\nthree different nanoparticle types and two different carrier fluids) were measured. The\nnanoparticles were an electrical conductor (nickel \u2013 Ni), an electro-active ceramic\n(barium titanate \u2013 BT) and iron oxide (magnetite \u2013 which is one part of w\u00fcstite FeO and\none part of haematite Fe2O3 \u2013 FO). BT was synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis, Ni\n4and FO by wet chemical synthesis [24]. In all cases a narrow particle size distribution\nwas achieved.\n2.2 Structural characterization of nanoparticles\nA range of techniques were used to characterise the nanoparticles. Transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM) was performed on a Philips CM 20 operating at 200 kV. Scanning\nelectron microscopy (S-FEG SEM) was performed on a Philips XL30. X-ray diffraction\n(XRD) patterns were obtained using a Siemens D5005 diffractometer with CuK\u03b1\nradiation and a Goebel mirror. The crystallite size was determined from the X-ray line\nbroadening using the Scherrer formula given by D = (0.9\u03bb) \/ (\u03b2 cos \u03b8), where D is the\naverage crystallite size, \u03bb is the X-ray wavelength used (1.5406\u01fa), \u03b2 is the angular line\nwidth of half maximum intensity and \u03b8 is the Bragg angle in degrees.\n2.3 Preparation of nanofluids and rheological measurement\nNanofluids were prepared by dispersing a known amount of oil with nanoparticles at 10,\n20 and 30 g\/l concentrations (given the bulk densities of FO, Ni and BT are 5240, 8800\nand 5850 kg m-3, respectively, the volume fractions (%) of these particles in fluids vary in\nthe range of 0.1- 0.6) and then placing the suspensions in an ultrasonic water bath for 30\nmin. The fluids used were silicone oil (Dow Corning 200\/50cS, viscosity 50cSt and\nspecific gravity 0.96) and 3M\u2122 Fluorinert FC70 perfluorinated oil (viscosity 12cSt and\nspecific gravity 1.94). The latter is used sometimes in the micro-electronics industry\nwhere it provides both chemical inertia and very low electrical conductivity. No\nsurfactants were used in the suspension formulations. The suspensions were found to be\nstable and there was no observable sedimentation over a period of three hours.\n5Rheological measurements were performed directly after the preparation of the\nsuspensions at room temperature (25 \u00b0C) using a Bohlin CVO rheometer (Malvern\nInstruments, UK). The measurements were based on the controlled shearing model at\nshear-rates ranging from 0.10-10 s-1. Calibrations performed against standard solutions on\na daily basis over the time of this work to ensure measurement accuracy.\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1 Nanoparticle characterization\nFig. 1a shows the TEM image of FO nanoparticles. It shows that the particles are\npredominantly spherical and the size of the particles varies from 10 to 15 nm, which is in\ngood agreement with the value estimated by X-ray diffraction measurements (Scherrer\nformula at 2\u03b8 of 35.5\u00ba) [25] (Fig. 2). Moreover, FO nanoparticles are aggregates due to \nhigh surface area and magnetic dipole\u2013dipole interactions between particles.\nThe morphology of the nickel sample was investigated by scanning electron\nmicroscopy (Fig. 1b). SEM images of Ni particles show that the Ni particles are also\nspherical with the average size between 90 and 100 nm. The synthesized nickel\nnanoparticles show a narrow particle size distribution (95 \u00b1 5 nm). Due to the large\nsurface to volume ratio and strong magnetic attraction forces, the Ni nanoparticles more\ntend to aggregate in order to minimize the total surface energy of the system.\nA systematic study of hydrothermal synthesis of BT was carried out to understand\nthe effects of parameters such as temperature and time on the formation of BT under\nalkaline conditions. The SEM micrographs (Fig. 1 c-f) of BT obtained by the\nhydrothermal method show that the powders contain aggregated nanoparticles with\n6uniform size distribution in the range of 100\u2013500 nm. The average particle size obtained\nat 180 \u00b0C for 24 hrs is about 100-150 nm (Fig.1 c), at 100 \u00b0C for 52 hrs about 200 nm\n(Fig.1 d), at 85 \u00b0C for 72 hrs about 400 nm (Fig.1 e) and at 65 \u00b0C for 192 hrs about 500\nnm (Fig.1 f). The Ba\/Ti ratio has to be 1.05:1 to achieve stoichiometric BT powder.\nExcess barium leads to the formation of some BaCO3 (due to the reaction with\natmospheric CO2). The formed BaCO3 was washed out using formic acid.\nFO, Ni and BT (100 and 200 nm) particles are spherical, but BT particles are\nmore or less cubic at larger sizes (especially at 400-500 nm).\nThe XRD peaks of FO (Fig. 2) could be indexed by the cubic structure of FO\n(JCPDS no. 19-629) indicating a high phase purity of FO and the diffraction peaks are\nbroad owing to small crystallite size.\nIn the case of Ni particles (Fig. 3) three characteristic peaks for nickel (2\u03b8\uf020= 44.5\u00ba,\n51.8\u00ba, and 76.4\u00ba), corresponding to Miller indices (111), (200), and (222), are observed.\nThis reveals that the resultant particles are pure face-centred cubic (fcc) nickel (JCPDS,\nNo. 04-0850) and only nickel is detected. Although it is known that nickel is easily\noxidized to oxides, some possible oxides such as NiO, Ni2O3 are not observed in the\nXRD profiles. The calculated size values for pure Ni by Scherrer formula at 2\u03b8 of 44.5\u00ba \nare general approximates to that of SEM observation (Fig. 1b).\nFigure 4 shows all the XRD patterns of the BT samples. As observed in Fig. 4 the\nXRD patterns fit well to the peak positions of the standard cubic phase BaTiO3 (JCPDS\nNo.31-174). As reported by Clark et al. [26] routine XRD is sensitive to small quantities\nof BaCO3 occurring in the hydrothermal process of BT. It is known that in the perovskite\nstructure, the [100] planes have the lowest surface energy [26]. The high-energy faceted\n7edges of the cubic particles may be subject to preferential dissolution. In addition, the\nstrain associated with the stabilization of the cubic structure tends to reduce the surface\narea of the growing particles. Therefore, the intermediate morphology consists of cubic\nlattice particles with a spherical morphology regained during the final stage of growth,\nalthough some larger particles still retain their cubic morphology. The final particle\nmorphology is probably a result of the competition between the growth rate and the edge\neffects. The structural defects of BT nanocrystals synthesized by the hydrothermal\nmethod are primarily in the form of lattice OH\u2212 ions, which are compensated by barium\nvacancies created on the surfaces of individual particles to maintain electro-neutrality\n[26].\n3.2 Sedimentation of nanoparticles in nanofluids\nIn order to investigate the possible effect of the gravity in our experiments, first of all the\nsedimentation time was estimated based on the force balance between the buoyancy force\nand the Stokes drag force. Sedimentation time is the time a particle takes to settle through\na depth of 1mm in nanofluid. The sedimentation time can be estimated by the Stocks law:\nV = (\u03c1P -\u03c1L) g R2\/18\u03b7     (1) \nWhere V is a sedimentation velocity of particles, R is a particles radius, \u03b7 is the viscosity \nof the carried medium, \u03c1P is the densities of the particles and \u03c1L is the density of the\nmedium and g is the acceleration rate of the gravity. The measurement of settling time\nwas carried out by using a high speed and high magnification camera. Photos have been\ntaken time after time up to 24 hrs. and the data were compared with a special photo-\nprogram. This allows detecting any movement of particles in the fluid more closely than\njust using any sort of camera. There was no observable sedimentation over a period of 3\n8hrs for all the prepared nanofluids (except for Ni-silicone oil nanofluid). The absence of\nsurfactant gives an opportunity to use the \u201cpure\u201d nanofluids in further characterization\nwithout additional complexity. The stability of nanofluids generally depends on the\nparticles\u2019 surface properties, size and shape. Agglomeration of nanoparticles occurs\nreadily in nanofluids, effectively increasing their size and their sedimentation rate.\nThe measured sedimentation time of nanofluids shows that no sedimentation was\nvisible in the FO-silicone oil nanofluid up to 8 hrs; in the Ni-silicone oil nanofluid the\nobservable sedimentation started after 2.5 hrs and the sedimentation of the BT-silicone\noil nanofluid was observable after 3 hrs. The sedimentation of different nanofluids starts\nat different times due to the different particle sizes and bulk densities of suspended\nnanoparticles as well as the different interactions between nanoparticles. Due to the lack\nof any additives or surfactant, the sedimentation eventually occurs due to the\nagglomeration of nanoparticles. All the measurements of rheological properties did not\nexceed 0.5 hr and hence the sedimentation effect was ignorable.\n3.3 Rheological behaviour\n3.3.1 Effect of solid loading on viscosity\nFig. 5 shows the viscosity change of silicone oil containing nanoparticles against shear\nrate in the range of 0.10-10 s-1. All of the suspensions show shear-thinning flow\nbehaviour over the whole examined shear rate range.\nThe viscosity of FO nanofluids increases with increasing particle loading, as\nshown in Fig. 5a. This may be explained as: because the interaction between particles\nincreases when the particle loading increases. When two colloidal particles approach\neach other, the double layer on each particle overlaps and it thus generates a repulsive\n9force on each other. This repulsive force is partly affected by an attractive force due to\nthe van der Waals interaction between the approaching particles and exhibits a power-law\ndistance dependence whose strength depends on the dielectric properties of the\ninteracting colloidal particles and intervening medium [27, 28].\nThe rheological behaviour of suspensions with different relative contents of nickel\n(Fig. 5b) is affected both by the volume fraction of solids and by agglomeration of nickel\nnanoparticles. The nickel nanoparticles are spherical and tend to form aggregates that in\nprinciple induce local changes in the viscosity of the suspension. The effects of the\naggregated particles on the rheological behaviour of suspensions are quite probably\nnonlinear and the different loadings of nanoparticles result in only small changes to the\nviscosity. The investigations of the aggregated nickel suspensions in this study and in\nearlier ones [29, 30] indicate that there may be a network of particles in the carrier fluid.\nIn organic media, such as, terpineol in [29] and silicone oil in this case, this may lead to\ndifferent stabilization and sedimentation mechanisms, compared to the most-studied\naqueous medium [31]. The sizes of the nickel used in previous studies were twelve [31]\nand three times [29] larger than that of the particles used in this study. In comparison of\nother two nanofluids in Fig. 5 a and c, the highest increase of viscosity is observed to be\nin the nickel nanoparticle suspensions in silicone oil, which indicates that strong\ninteractions between Ni nanoparticles exist and such interactions become greater when\nthe nanoparticle loading increases, which thus may lead to the formation of not only Ni\nparticle aggregates but also Ni network.\nSuspensions of BT in silicone oil (Fig. 5c) exhibit non-linear viscoelastic\nbehaviour of shear thinning. This is in agreement with the observations made by Khastgir\n10\net al. [28], who attributed the viscoelastic behaviour to the shear rate dependence of the\nsize and structure of aggregates of BT particles. If the system contains more than 10 vol%\nof solids, it shows the signs of plasticity which was explained as the formation of\nnetworks of particles. In our case, the volume percentage of BT particles in silicone oil is\nless than 1%, far below 10%; it is unlikely to form networks of particles in BT nanofluids.\nWhen the size of the particles decreases (BT 100-120 nm, Ni 90-100 nm and FO\n10-15 nm), the specific surface area of the particles increases and there are larger\nnumbers of nanoparticles in the suspension for a given weight loading. This clearly has\nan influence on the macroscopic fluid properties. However, such an influence is\novershadowed by the agglomeration of primary nanoparticles. In another word, the\nviscosity change of the fluid containing nanoparticles is due to the role played by\nagglomerated particles.\nThe two fluid media used in this investigation have different chemical make-up,\ndifferent viscosity and different density. Hence the inter-particle interaction in these\nmedia should be expected to be different. Fig. 6 (a, b and c) shows the change of\nviscosity of suspensions containing three types of nanoparticles in FC70 against shear\nrates. All of the suspensions show shear-thinning flow behaviour over the whole\nexamined shear rate range (0.10-10 s-1). The viscosity increases with increasing solid\nloading of FO, Ni and BT indicating that the inter-particle interaction has an influence on\nthe rheological behaviour of the suspensions. Fig. 6a indicates that the rheological\nbehaviour of the suspensions containing the particles of FO depends mainly on the\nstrength of nanoparticles interaction. The Ni-FC70 suspensions (Fig. 6b) do not show the\ngreatest increase of viscosity with the increase of particles concentration as observed in\n11\nsilicone oil, indicating relatively weaker interactions between Ni particles and\/or between\nNi particles and base fluid when they are in FC70; probably the formation of the network\nof Ni particles does not occur. The BT-FC70 suspensions with different solid additions\nare all viscoelastic in the examined shear rate range (Fig. 6c).\n3.3.2 Effect of particle size on viscosity\nIn general, the reduction of the average size of the solid-phase while keeping its\nconcentration constant brings particles much closer together. In this study the\ninterparticle spacing varies typically within a notional, 3-10 particle diameter, given a\nuniform suspension. Fig. 7 shows the viscosity of suspensions against shear rate in the\nrange of 0.10-10 s-1 for (a) silicone oil and for (b) FC70 fluid suspension with 20 g\/l of\nsolid concentrations of BT particles (size 120 nm, 200 nm and 500 nm). All of the\nsuspensions show shear-thinning flow character at the whole range of shear rates.\nThe viscosity both in silicone oil and in FC70-based nanoparticles suspensions\nincreases with decreasing size of the BT particles. Fig. 7 shows that the size of the\nparticles plays an important role both in the silicone oil and in the FC70 fluid-based\nnanoparticles suspensions. The smaller particles (120 nm and 200 nm) cause bigger\nincrease in the viscosity, which is in agreement with some previous studies [32-34]. The\nflow curves (Fig. 7) show increasing shear thinning behaviour with decreasing particles\nsize.\nFig. 8 illustrates the notional behaviour of nano-suspension with increasing shear\nrate. Overall it can be assumed that the rheological properties of nano-suspensions are\ninfluenced by many factors, not only by the particle concentration, size and the\n12\ninteraction between the particles and the medium, but also by higher order networking\nand agglomeration.\nOne of the latest reviews [35] shows a similar observation to those shown here,\nnamely that the viscosity increases with the volume fraction of nanoparticles and with the\nsize reduction. One of the highest increases in viscosity was measured by Wang et al.\n[36] who found an 86% increment of the effective viscosity in Al2O3 water-based\nnanofluids. The classical models which were used to predicting the viscosity of\nnanofluids such as Einstein\u2019s [37], Krieger and Dougherty\u2019s [38] and Nielsen\u2019s [39]\ncould not be used to fully explain our observations.\n3.3.3 Effect of nanoparticles mixture on viscosity\nFO and Ni nanoparticles were dispersed in two types of fluids in the ratio of 1 : 1 by\nweight. The difference of the size of the suspended particles is 1 : 10 in this case, and the\nmixed nanoparticles system was found to sediment more slowly than one-type particle\nsystem with larger particles. It is believed that the smaller particles influence the\n\u201cnetwork\u201d of larger particles, in this case, Ni particles. Even weak inter-particle attraction\nhas an effect on the sedimentation. The van der Waals attraction between the bigger\nparticles is different as well when the system contains small sized particles. The small\nparticles are thought to prevent the bigger particles touching each other and mixed-\nparticle agglomerates are energetically unfavoured [40].\nSedimentation was experimentally observable in the mixed nanoparticles system\nafter 3.5 hrs, which is 1 hr longer than for the pure nickel nanofluid. Our experimental\nresult shows good agreement with the study by Thies-Weesie et al. [41] that shows that\n13\nthe sedimentation velocity is reduced under gravity for mixed uncharged spherical\nparticles.\nFig. 9 shows the viscosity of mixed-particle suspensions against shear rate in the\nrange 0.10-10 s-1 for (a) silicone and (b) FC70 oils with 10 and 20 g\/l. The mixtures\nchosen were of nickel and iron-oxide nanoparticles. The silicone oil-Ni suspension has\nshown the largest increase of viscosity in all the examined one-type nanoparticles\nsuspensions and FO particles were used to provide a bimodal size range. This leads to\nslightly reduced viscosity, when compared against the expected value at the same solid\nconcentrations, which probably is because small FO particles prevent the formation of Ni\nnetwork. A general observation found that the shear thinning behaviour of a pure fluid\nappears in the shear rate range of < 1 s-1. However, a close observation would find that\nshear thinning range extended to the range of 1-10 s-1 in the mixtures, which implies that\nthe inter-particle interaction between Ni and FO probably still exists.\n4. Conclusion\nThree types of nano-particles with different sizes have been synthesised using wet-\nchemical and hydrothermal methods. Nanofluids were prepared using silicone oil and\nFC70 fluid as dispersing media. The rheological characterization of these nanofluids was\ncarried out. All of the silicone oil and FC70 suspensions (containing 10, 20 and 30 g\/l\nnanoparticles) show shear thinning behaviour at the shear-rate range of 0.10\u201310 s\u22121. The\nlargest change of viscosity in silicone oil was exhibited by nickel suspensions. This result\nis due to the fact that the interaction of metallic Ni in silicone oil leads to the formation of\nnetwork. In a parallel study [10] it was demonstrated that 30 g\/l nickel nanoparticles\nsuspended in the silicone oil exhibited a DC conductivity (0.1 S\/m) that was almost\n14\neleven orders of magnitude greater than that of the base fluid (10-12 S\/m), whereas the\ncorresponding increase in DC conductivity for 30 g\/l nickel nanoparticles in FC70 (8 x\n10-12S\/m) compared to the base fluid (10-12S\/m) was quite modest. BT particles with the\nsizes of 120, 200 and 500 nm suspended in silicone oil and FC70 fluid showed an\nincrease of viscosity with decreasing particle size, indicating the increase of interactions\nbetween particles when particle size decreases. In the nanofluids containing both FO and\nNi particles, the smaller FO particles prevent Ni particles from forming network and\ntherefore the effect of Ni particles on the viscosity is not as obvious as in the nanofluids\ncontaining only Ni particles.\nExperimental results shown in this study indicate that the viscosity of the organic\nfluids could be controlled within a narrow range or tuned by adding nanoparticles in the\nfluids.\nAcknowledgements\nZsuzsanna Libor would like to acknowledge the financial support of the UK Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under Platform Grant No. EP\/D506638\/1\nNanoscale Multifunctional Ferroic Materials and Devices.\nReferences\n[1] Choi S (1995) Developments Applications of Non-Newtonian Flows FED-vol\n231\/MD-vol 66, ed Siginer D A and Wang H P (New York: ASME)\n[2] Chiang CL., Sung CS., Chen CY (2006) J Magn Magn Mater 305:483\n[3] Vekas L., Bica D. and Avdeev MV (2007) China Particuology 5:43\n[4] Antolini E, Ferretti M, Gemme S (1996) J Mater Sci 31:2187\n[5] Eisazadeh H, Spinks G, Wallace GG (1993) Mater Forum 17:241\n15\n[6] Zhang HT, Wu G, Chen XH, Qiu XG (2006) Materials Research Bulletin 41 : 495\n[7] Ikawa H, Munekata N, Shirakami T (2002) Trans Mater Res Soc Japan 27 : 707\n[8] Tokita K, Sato S (2005) Key Eng Mater 301:219\n[9] Chen H, Ding Y, Tan C (2007) New J Phys 9 : 367\n[10] Wilson SA, Libor Z, Skordos AA, Zhang Q (2009) J Phys D: Appl Phys 42 : 062003\n[11] Masuda H, Ebata A, Teramae K, Hishiunma N (1993) Netsu Bussei Japan 4 : 227\n[12] Das SK, Putra N, Roetzel W (2003) Int.
