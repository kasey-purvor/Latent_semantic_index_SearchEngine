Professional development for academics occurs in a complex environment of \nchanging national policy directives, with increasing demands on institutions, academic \ndevelopers and academics themselves (Brew, 2007; Deem, Hillyard and Reed, 2008). \nFurthermore, the academic role has been changing to include a wider range of tasks and \nresponsibilities (Blackmore and Blackwell, 2003), with academics needing subject, \nresearch, teaching, leadership and administrative expertise. Within this context the \nqualitative cross-case study research reported in this article explored faculty-based \nacademics\u2019 views on what influences their understandings, behaviours and attitudes \ntowards their professional development. Informed by critical realist ontology, the research \nadopts a similar frame to Kahn\u2019s exploration of early-career academics\u2019 perspectives \n(2009) in that it is centred on the relationship between structure and agency and, in this \ninstance, the ways in which the agency of academics might mediate structural influences \non professional development.  \nThe article is underpinned by an acknowledgment that understandings of \n\u2018academic\u2019 or \u2018professional development\u2019 lack clarity, with the concept being \u2018neither \ninnocent nor neutral\u2019 (McWilliam, 2002, p. 289). However, whilst issues of definition and \nmeaning were considered integral to this research, it is not possible to include this aspect \nhere. Furthermore other research, such as \u00c5kerlind\u2019s (2005) phenomenographic study in \nAustralia, has explored such issues in depth.  However, whilst there is a wealth of \ninformative literature related to academic and educational development, it is arguably \nlimited in some aspects; this research adds to and complements the existing knowledge.  \n 2\nFor example, the literature rarely adopts a \u2018holistic perspective on development across the \nrange of academic work\u2019 \u00c5kerlind (2005, p. 3), yet this research explicitly considered all \naspects of the role. Moreover the voice of faculty-based academics is largely absent from \nthe dominant discourses about academic development, there is therefore an emerging need \nfor inclusive, participative research that enables academics to enter the debate: \nFundamentally, we cannot account for any outcome unless we understand the \nagent\u2019s project in relation to her social context. And we cannot understand her \nproject without entering into her reflexive deliberations about her personal \nconcerns in conjunction with the objective social context that she confronts (Archer \n2003, p. 131). \n \n \nThe research was carried out in two English universities and is therefore explicated \nprincipally within an English context. However, the findings and emergent themes expose \nareas for reflection about the constraints and enablements academics perceive in respect of \ntheir development, which arguably have wider implications. \nTheoretical Basis \nThe ontological meta-theory of critical realism has informed the ideological assumptions \nembedded in this research, its aims and objectives, the design, process, and analytical lens \nadopted. \u2018The essential ontological relation which educational researchers need to examine \nis the relationship between structure and agency or enablement and constraint\u2019 (Scott, \n2000, p. 3). Indeed the interplay between influences from the social system, its rules and \nresources (the structure) on academics\u2019 approaches to development and the power of \nindividual human action (agency) was of primary interest in this research. Within the \nbroader paradigm of critical realism, Archer\u2019s (1982, 1995, 2003) morphogenetic \napproach, which proposes that society is continually reshaped by the interplay between \nstructure and agency, this taking place across time, was particularly influential. It is argued \nthat \u2018causal powers\u2019, also known as \u2018generative mechanisms\u2019, defined as \u2018potentialities \nwhich may or may not be exercised\u2019 (Hartwig, 2007: 57), result in constraints or \n 3\nenablements. However, according to Archer, these will only have impact if \u2018in the light of \ntheir objective circumstances\u2019, individuals perceive them as being relevant to their actions. \nThus \u2018for anything to exert the power of a constraint or an enablement, it has to stand in a \nrelationship such that it obstructs or aids the achievement of some specific agential \nenterprise\u2019 (Archer, 2003, p. 5). As such, structures may mediate, but they do not \ndetermine (Sayer, 1992). \nMethodology \nThis research was undertaken in two case study universities in the north of England; a \ntraditional \u2018old university\u2019 (University A); and a \u2018new university\u2019 (University B). These \ninstitutions were sampled to reflect a potential contextual difference, or \u2018binary line\u2019, \nbetween the original English \u2018old\u2019 universities, established before 1992 by Royal Charter \nor Act of Parliament, and \u2018new\u2019 universities, former polytechnics or colleges given the \nstatus of universities under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 (Deem, 1998, p. \n48).  The pre-1992 \u2018old universities\u2019 are recognized as focussing more on research activity, \nwith larger numbers of research students and postdoctoral researchers who also engage in \nteaching work. By contrast, the \u2018new universities\u2019 have generally developed an emphasis \non teaching, or knowledge exchange rather than production, alongside more varied routes \ninto higher education and stronger connections with industry (Stevenson and Bell, 2009). \n \nBetween September 2007 and March 2008 a total of 36 narrative interviews with \nacademics were carried out, 18 in each institution. Narrative interviews are defined by \nReissman (1993, p. 70) as interviews that enable the \u2018systematic study of personal \nexperience and meaning\u2019. Indeed, the interviews in this study were designed and \nconducted with a loosely structured format, more akin to \u2018guided conversations\u2019 (Yin \n2003, p. 89) that sought to reflect the research aims, empirical elements of the literature \nreview and the theoretical framework. Thus, following Rubin and Rubin (1995, cited in \n 4\nYin, 2003), the actual flow of questions was changeable, despite adhering to the following \nconsistent line of inquiry. At the start of each interview, participants were asked to outline \ntheir understanding of professional development. This was followed by three sets of \nprompts or questions, the first eliciting information about the participant\u2019s professional and \ncareer background and how they perceived that development activity may have contributed \nto it. The second set of prompts explored how national \/ international issues may impact on \nthe participant\u2019s approaches to development. The final set of prompts asked the \nparticipants to share their views on how their institutions internal approaches to supporting \nacademic development had influenced the participant\u2019s approach to development and in \nwhat ways their professional relationships both internally and externally had impacted on \ntheir professional learning. As a summary closing question, all participants were asked to \nsummarise the key things that make a difference to what they do in respect of professional \ndevelopment. This format enabled participants to explicate how circumstance and context \nmay be of significance to them (Sayer, 1992). \nConsistency and comparability were assured by attention to the following four \nvariables through the sampling process: \n \n\u2022 Gender; \n\u2022 length of academic experience; \n\u2022 disciplinary focus (\u2018pure\u2019 or \u2018applied\u2019 subject areas as defined by participants); \n\u2022 professional status in respect of whether the participant had a subject-related external \nprofessional development framework. \n \nFor critical realists, \u2018variables\u2019 are themselves conceptual interpretations (Cruickshank, \n2007), thus attention to key variables ensured that the \u2018range of meanings within the \nsample [was] representative of the range of meanings within the population\u2019 (\u00c5kerlind, \n2005, p. 9 italics in original). The characteristics of the resultant sample of participants \nfrom each case study institution are provided as appendices to this article. \nThe process of analysis commenced with the full transcription of all interviews.  \n 5\nThe analysis of data is \u2018inescapably a selective process\u2019 (Miles and Hubermann 1994, p. \n55) with coding and classifying being the means by which such selection and data \nreduction can be effected. In this project, codes were created in two phases: first with \nreference to the underpinning theoretical basis and literature; and secondly through \nstructuring and reduction in the data.  In this second phase, the data was initially \nscrutinised for \u2018patterns of choice\u2019, which \u2018surface[d] some generalisations\u2019 (Cohen et al. \n2000, p.295) and highlighted additional concepts as a precursor to further more in-depth \nanalysis, after which \u2018similarities and differences\u2019 were drawn out. Following Kitwood \n(1977, cited in Cohen et al., 2000) items were grouped together, where they covered \nsimilar themes or areas. In this way, the data was reduced and restructured to aid the \nprocess of understanding and identifying emerging themes. This form of analysis enabled \ncomparative exploration between the case study institutions and between different variants \nwithin the sample. Additionally analysis through \u2018categorization of content\u2019, where a \nparticular aspect or question in the data was examined across the entire sample, further \nilluminated trends and commonalities. The emerging information was then examined and \ncompared to the theoretical concepts, with new categorisations being developed as \nnecessary. In a similar way, but starting with the category or theme, the data was examined \nfor all traces of that theme. This method, according to Cohen et al. (2000, p. 296) \n\u2018transcends the rather artificial boundaries which the items themselves imply.\u2019  \nAdditionally, in order to address the research purposes and questions for this \nproject, as important as the identification of occurring themes, the \u2018study of omissions\u2019 \n(Kitwood 1977, cited in Cohen et al. 2000, p. 296) was undertaken. This stage of analysis \nrequired clarity about expectations and anticipations in respect of issues that may emerge. \nKitwood (1997, cited in Cohen et al. 2000, p. 296) describes another analytical strategy as \n\u2018generating and testing hypotheses\u2019 which, it could be argued, is interlinked with the other \nanalytical processes. Through iterative engagement with the data and a detailed, recorded \n 6\nprocess of reflection, the researcher developed provisional propositions at different stages \nin the research process that allowed for explicit hypothesis testing. \nThe study was managed using qualitative data analysis software, which enabled a \ncross-case comparison and thematic analysis to emerge. This \u2018intensive\u2019 research design \n(Sayer, 1992) was heuristic, as it generated further understanding of individuals\u2019 \nperspectives in their current context, with \u2018the primary questions concern[ing] how some \ncausal process works out in a particular case or limited number of cases\u2019 (Sayer, 1992, p. \n242). Tentative explanations have been reached through iterative engagement with the \ndata, the theoretical frame and the literature. These explanations, or themes, are presented \nin the following sections of this article. \nThe Significance of Professional Status \nProfessionalism in academia is positioned between the tensions of a \u2018government-imposed \nform of \u201cexpert professionalism\u201d \u2026 focused on skill and standards\u2019 (McLean, 2008, p. \n124), and the concepts of academic autonomy and critical social engagement. The voices \nof academics raised through this research indicate concerns and confusions about \nprofessional status. These \u2018constellations of concerns\u2019 have significance for defining action \nand determining practices (Archer, 2007, p. 17) related to professional development.  \n \n\u2026professions embrace professional development in order to survive \u2026 Any profession that \nwants to maintain its status \u2026 its power base, has to demonstrate to society that they are \nengaged in a process of development, that their staff are up to date and have contemporary \nknowledge \u2026 On one level CPD is about people developing \u2026 but if you look at the \nprofession as a body, I think CPD is there for another purpose, it\u2019s there for survival basically, \nas a professional, that\u2019s my take. (Sven, University B) \n \nSven\u2019s view is illustrative of the work of Rothwell and Arnold (2005), who suggest \nthat where it is perceived that a profession has less robust foundations, it is more likely that \nvigorous, explicit, professional development policies will be implemented. Linked to this \nis the debate about trust or mistrust and coercion, which is aired in the literature \n(Cullingford, 2002; Deem et al., 2008) and the influence of mandatory or non-mandatory \n 7\nprofessional development.  This debate was also evident in the University B data, where \nmore of the sample worked in applied subject areas with mandatory, discipline-related \nprofessional development requirements; \n \nNo one within the university can say \u2018Patrick have you done your CPD?\u2019 My professional body \ncan say have you done it, and if I have not evidenced it, I can lose my status. (Patrick, \nUniversity B) \n \nAdditionally, the University B data reflects change in the external environment of \nthe discipline as a significant factor affecting academics\u2019 development priorities. \n \nFor me it\u2019s more to do with the national issues driving the professions that we are serving. \nThey are very dominant drivers because most of our business is commissioned\u2026. (Patti, \nUniversity B) \n \nIt is important, therefore, for academic developers to be mindful that academics\u2019 \nallegiances to professional bodies in conjunction with the weight academics give to being \nknowledgeable and up-to-date in their subject area, can significantly influence their \napproaches to development. Yet a different picture emerged when exploring the example \nof the Higher Education Academy (HEA), a United Kingdom external body that seeks to \nlead, support and inform the professional development of staff in higher education (HEA, \ncited in Oakleigh Consulting Ltd, 2008). The HEA also operates a \u2018professional \nrecognition scheme\u2019 underpinned by a Professional Standards Framework for teaching and \nsupporting learning in higher education (UKPSF). Data in this research indicates that the \nacademy has limited influence on academics\u2019 development with professional recognition \nbeing largely perceived as a driver for institutional strategy and policy. Asked broadly \nabout the HEA, Verna (University B) replied \u2018I haven\u2019t got the time to read the e-mails\u2019, \nsimilarly Diana explains: \n \nI get regular e-mails from them, I get regular things through the post from the HEA for me to \nvote on things, that I don\u2019t read, I just bin them normally, which is awful but \u2026 (Diana, \nUniversity A) \n \n 8\nJosh (University A), a student on the post-graduate teaching programme, was the \nonly participant, of the 36 academics interviewed, who showed awareness of the UKPSF \n(HEA 2006), and his understanding was limited. Josh explained that he had heard of the \nstandards \u2018through the PG Cert, that\u2019s the kind of things that would get discussed at \nteaching committees that I wouldn\u2019t understand\u2019 (Josh, University A).  \nThe Influence of Extra-institutional Initiatives and Priorities \nIn both case study institutions, participants described negative influences arising from the \ninternationally-recognised trends of increasing managerialism (including audit, quality \nassurance and \u2018league tables\u2019), simultaneous reductions in collegiate governance (Clegg, \n2009; Dill, 2005; McWilliam, 2002) and the \u2018push \u2026 into market and marketlike \nbehaviors\u2019 (Slaughter and Leslie 1997, p. 111). Notably, however, the potentially contrary \nforces of academic autonomy (Karran, 2009) and self-regulation were given little \nsignificance.  \n\u2026 demands on academics are so \ngreat these days, constant \nefficiency, increasing student \nnumbers, decreasing staff numbers, \nmore assessment, more auditing, \ngreater performance management \nregimes, where do you find time to \ndo any of that [continuing \nprofessional development]?  \n(Phillip, University A) \n\u2026 quantifying and measuring \nthings that mean that you can \nthen influence quality; people \ngenerate numbers, they do \nwhat they need to do and tick \nthe box. It only works in \nsome areas, but in teaching it \ndoesn\u2019t, particularly not if it\u2019s \nto the detriment of your \navailable time to do the job \nproperly. (Patrick, University \nB) \n \nFurther to this, the data also identifies variable influence from specific English \npolitical and policy initiatives such as the National Student Survey, a survey that aims to \ngain feedback on the academic experience of final year undergraduate students \n(http:\/\/www.thestudentsurvey.com\/) and the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE). The \nRAE is a UK-wide activity that assesses the quality rating of  research to inform the \nselective distribution of public research funding through the four UK higher education \n 9\nfunding bodies  (RAE, undated); it has been described as the \u2018national research game\u2019 \n(Lucas 2006: 29). \nWith regard to the National Student Survey, many participants described being \naware of \u2018a lot of fuss\u2019 (Josh, University A), and went on to discredit the methodology of \nthe survey and distance themselves from it. There was consensus that survey results may \ntrigger policy change at institutional level with potentially a few procedural changes, but \nthat it has limited impact individual\u2019s development.  \n \nI have heard about it \u2026 but I am \nnot really involved, it is something \nwhich is happening \u2026 \n(Brandon, University A) \nThe university has just said \nyou have got to return all \nessays to students within \nthree weeks and that\u2019s the \nonly impact that\u2019s had on us. \n(Arthur, University B) \n \nInterviewees also made frequent reference to the RAE, which may have been \nexpected as the data collection period coincided with the closing date for submissions to \nthe RAE 2008. Thus participants felt \u2018that in terms of external influences\u2026the RAE \nprocess is a big influence which you cannot ignore\u2019 (Dawn, University A). The experience \nof the RAE, however, was recounted differently in the two institutions. Data from \nUniversity A, a member of the Russell Group (www.russellgroup.ac.uk\/) and therefore \nrecognized as a \u2018research intensive university, reflects the strength of institutional and \nmanagerial response to the exercise, resulting in significant influences on academics\u2019 \npriorities and approaches to professional development. Within the University A data, 55% \n(n = 10) of academics interviewed agreed that the impetus to meet the RAE requirements, \nresulted in a \u2018disastrous process\u2019 (Dawn, University A) and was \u2018very counter-productive\u2019 \n(Marie, University A) with regard to academics\u2019 approaches to professional development. \nMartin (University A) offered the following example:  \n \nWe write books, or students share [authorship] as part of their CPD; we have been actively \ndiscouraged from writing books with students, because they are not research, because they \ncannot be entered [in the RAE]. So this causes awful tension (Martin, University A). \n \n 10\nBy contrast, academics in University B largely reflect little influence from the \nRAE. Chandra, Arthur, Judith and Sophia (all University B) stated that the RAE had no \nimpact on them, although Sophia added that she felt that the lack of engagement from her \nsubject area could be detrimental to herself and colleagues if they were looking to develop \nacademic careers in other institutions.  \nThe Influence of Intra-institutional Initiatives and Priorities \nParticipants primarily expressed intra-institutional influences on their approaches to \nprofessional development through perceptions of institutional philosophy and strategy in \nthis regard. Whilst, in both institutions, there was no awareness of written policy \nstatements on academic development, participants described institutional approaches as \nlargely \u2018supportive\u2019 and \u2018encouraging\u2019. Formal programmes offered in the institutions, \ncommonly linked to teaching and learning (\u00c5kerlind, 2005; Clegg, 2003; Gosling, 2008) \nwere highly influential in shaping participants\u2019 concepts of professional development and \nbecame the focus of their interpretation of \u2018institutional approaches\u2019. \nJames (University A) describes the institutional approach as \u2018kind of like a big \ndevelopment buffet, courses are all there you just go and help yourself\u2019 (James, University \nA). Similarly in University B, Arthur suggests \u2018in effect it has a central sort of \u2026 \u201cwe will \nprovide certain training courses, and I think having done that that\u2019s our responsibility and \nthat\u2019s development\u201d\u2019 (Arthur, University B). Further to this, many academics, in both \ninstitutions, qualified their perceptions of central functions and approaches by explaining \nthat they experienced the most tangible, supportive culture for development at \ndepartmental, school or team level. Yet, it is apparent that this devolved approach may also \nresult in inequalities; Sophia\u2019s example being expressed in different ways across both \ninstitutions: \n \nI think that there are differences between schools depending on how well the schools do \nfinancially. I think that my school does well financially and therefore we possibly have more \nmoney for academic staff development than other schools. (Sophia, University B) \n 11\n \nImportantly, within the data there is broad agreement that institutional strategies \nhave limited influence across the academic body; their impact being dependent upon \nacademics proactively engaging with the processes and opportunities. \n \nIt depends on your own initiative, \nother people are not pushing and \nencouraging. \n(Brandon, University A) \n \nThere are opportunities there if \npeople want to take them on, is \nwhat I would say. I would say that \nit was led by the academics, in my \nexperience. (Imran, University A) \nI think that it has [a \nphilosophy for CPD] because I \nhave looked for it and I think \nthere\u2019s a difference, I\u2019ve \nlooked for it for me. I don\u2019t \nknow how much they shout \nabout it \u2026 so there is a culture \nthere but you have to look for \nit and once you find it it\u2019s \nwonderful. (Jessica, University \nB) \n \nAnother important message for academic developers is that it is apparent that the \nexperience of institutional support for professional development differs between \u2018new \nstarters in the last five years\u2019 and those who have been working in academia longer \n(Pamela, University A). Thus Phillip, who has over 21 years\u2019 experience, suggests that \u2018for \nestablished staff it\u2019s much more difficult\u2019 (Phillip, University A) and George also suggests \nthat institutional emphasis is on newly appointed staff as he feels that \u2018the university \nencourages development of staff on \u201cprobationary level\u201d\u2019 (George, University A). Whilst \nthis view is not universally apparent in the data, it is interesting that Thomas, who has \nbetween 6 and 10 years\u2019 academic experience, suggested that University A is developing a \ncoherent approach to academic development, but that \u2018it\u2019s building\u2026from new staff\u2019. \nThroughout the data there are examples of academics\u2019 deliberations being \nconsequent upon the ways in which they confront and mediate their employing \ninstitution\u2019s response to extra-institutional structural mechanisms. Within these processes, \npolicies and priorities, which are experienced as being misaligned, can have negative \ninfluences on academics\u2019 attitudes and behaviours in respect of their development. \nPerceived incompatibility and lack of correlation between institutional and individual \npriorities are particularly constraining. Academics perceive their employers as having, at \n 12\nbest, different priorities and, at worst, competing priorities. This research suggests that it is \npossible for structural causal powers, in the form of extra- and intra-institutional \napproaches, to be more facilitative, aligned and responsive in order to generate \nenablements wherever possible.   \nThe Influence of Supportive Networks \nWhilst academics respond favourably to having individual control over their development, \nthey often experience support from extra- and intra-institutional networks as enabling and \ninfluential. With regard to extra-institutional networks, academics described being highly \nmotivated to develop, maintain and grow external subject-related networks to support a \nrange of academic endeavours, including professional development and career progression. \nThere is overwhelming consensus from academic voices in this research that \u2018externality\u2019, \noften achieved through discipline-related connections, is significant in shaping \nprofessional development. \n \n\u2018the majority of it [my professional \ndevelopment] happens, putting \naside the PG Cert, outside the \nuniversity. (Josh, University A) \n[My colleagues] would see \nsome of their intellectual \nstimulation coming from \nhaving seminars with people \ninvolved from other \nuniversities. (Dieter, \nUniversity B) \n \nOver 80% (n = 29) of all academics interviewed referred in some way to the \nimportance of networks, most commonly (53%, n = 19) describing discipline or subject-\nrelated networks as influencing not only research work, but also enabling important \nassociations with the external environment of the subject. However, whilst external \nnetworks were described as \u2018very important and they\u2019re probably stronger\u2026than the \nrelationships within the university\u2019 (Diana, University A), they had very different \ninfluential foci in each institution. In University A, academics described stronger \ninfluences from networks that supported research-related activities, whilst in University B \nthere was more significance given to those associated with teaching and learning. \n 13\n We have research collaborations \nbut not teaching collaborations. \n(Thomas, University A) \nI\u2019m a member of the [discipline \nassociation] which has a section \ndevoted to the teaching and \nlearning of [the subject] \u2026 I\u2019m \non the mailing list for that, I \nattend conferences and the \nmeetings \u2026 (Arthur, University \nB) \n \nAcademic participants also attributed variable levels of significance to intra-\ninstitutional networks, teams or \u2018communities of practice\u2019 (Wenger 1998). Wenger argues \nthat such networks \u2018are privileged locus for the creation of knowledge\u2019 (Wenger 1998, p. \n214, italics in original), but for critical realists, these networks, teams or groups of like-\nminded academics can themselves become micro structures capable of generating causal \npowers. In both institutions, internal networks, whilst commonly discipline-related, were \neither research or teaching focussed and appeared to reflect the recognised differential \nstatus accorded to each activity (Barnett, 2003; Malcolm and Zukas, 2001). The data also \nrevealed that teaching networks were experienced as pragmatic, business and organisation-\nled, whilst research-related communities were considered to be collegiate and discursive. \n \nIt\u2019s about who\u2019s going to teach what, \nwhat\u2019s the syllabus going to be, is it \ngoing to change, have we lost \nsomebody and if staff are teaching \nother modules would they want to \nchange the syllabus. It tends to be \ndominated by things like that. \n(Josh, University A) \n \nIt\u2019s about the organisation but \n\u2026 if that\u2019s not done then \nsometimes sessions are not \ncovered. There are many \nmembers of staff; delivering \nlectures, seminars and \ntutorials to groups and it\u2019s \nextremely complicated so we \ndo need to sit down as a \ngroup and go through the \ntimetable.(Verna, University \nB) \n \nIt\u2019s highly collaborative; so we have \na team approach \u2026 we are a \nresearch-led university and it\u2019s \nresearch with a very big bold capital \nR that tends to dominate most \ndiscussions. \n(Phillip, University A) \nWe have lunchtime research \npresentations where people \nare invited and discussion \nflows off the back of that \u2026 \nwe are in research groups\u2026 \n(Patrick, University B) \n \nFurther to this, newer members of academic staff, particularly those with fewer \nthan ten years\u2019 experience, describe working with others as highly significant for their \n 14\nprofessional development. Diana (University A), has between 6 and 10 years\u2019 experience \nand states that \n \nIt\u2019s mainly the younger staff who perhaps have been more sort of encouraged to think about \nthese things and having courses and been the person who is being reviewed quite a lot of the \ntime\u2026so we talk amongst ourselves about teaching methods, assessment methods, doing \nbizarre things in lectures and so on and ways to get attention and trying out new things, using \non-line resources, but our more senior colleagues don\u2019t do. (Diana, University A) \n \nImportantly for academic developers therefore, is the evidence that informal and ad \nhoc networking can result in empowering relationships which are influential in shaping \napproaches to practice and professional development. This is particularly apparent where a \nsense of friendship and like-mindedness are also felt, with networks being most effective \nwhen they are small and come together naturally in collegiate, joint spaces, for discussion \nand sharing of good practice. Within both case study institutions, however the approach to \nfacilitating such networks or mentoring was inconsistent. Academic developers can, \ntherefore, facilitate engagement through a coherent approach to enabling informal \nnetworks and mentoring through, for example creative use of space. \nThe Significance of Agency \nEvident throughout the data are the ways in which academics use their own personal \npowers to mediate structural influences and make decisions on intent and future actions. \nFor the academic and educational development community this finding signifies the \nimportance of being ever mindful of the significance of agency in influencing decisions \nabout engagement. Whilst structural properties, such as the extra-institutional context of \nhigher education, are shown to have generative causal powers that \u2018might impede or \nfacilitate\u2019 action (Archer, 2003, p. 7), these are mediated at the intra-institutional level. \nThey then only become realised or \u2018activated\u2019 when academics respond to them. The \n\u2018reflexive, agential deliberations\u2019 (Archer, 2003, p. 130) of the \u2018voices from below\u2019 \nconfirm that \u2018for anything to exert the power of a constraint or an enablement, it has to \n 15\nstand in a relationship such that it obstructs or aids the achievement of some specific \nagential enterprise\u2019 (Archer, 2003: 5, italics in original).  \nAs well as the mediation of structural extra- and intra-institutional, the data \ndemonstrates the influence of the immediacy of a range of very personal, less tangible, \nvalue-based concerns. These concerns significantly influence how academics respond to \nprofessional development; examples include being interested, or stimulated, having a \npersonal philosophy that values professional development, being able to see a \u2018fit\u2019 with \npersonal circumstances, \u2018performative competence\u2019 (Archer, 2000, p. 198), and being able \nto make autonomous decisions about the direction of their development.  \nThus, the individual\u2019s concerns and deliberations, act as a conduit to the influences \non their approaches to professional development. It is therefore argued that for the \ncommunity of academic and educational developers, the significance of agency highlights \nthe importance of opening the debate and responding to the \u2018voices from below\u2019, \u2018ensuring \nthat academics are not evacuated of all their personal powers\u2019 (Kahn, 2009, p. 206). \nConclusion \nThe research reported in this article set out to explore what faculty academics consider to \nbe the main influences on their behaviours and attitudes towards their professional \ndevelopment. In doing so, the analysis offers an explanation of the interplay between \nstructure and agency in the context of academic development in higher education. The \nproject adopted a comparative, case study approach in recognition of the two main types of \ninstitutions that characterise the English system of higher education. However, the analysis \nof the data showed that an institution\u2019s historical context is not necessarily a significant \ninfluence. Indeed, interestingly for those involved in supporting academic development, \nother variables such as the academic\u2019s professional background and allegiance to subject-\nrelated professional bodies become evident as being more dominant and powerful in \ninfluencing professional development.  \n 16\nInstitutional context does become relevant, though, in relation to how each \ninstitution responds, or activates, extra-institutional initiatives in setting its values and \npriorities. However, the ways in which the specific institutional responses influence \nacademics\u2019 attitudes and behaviours towards professional development can be seen as \nindicative symptoms of the three broader themes, which were experienced in common \nacross both institutions. Whilst this research was undertaken within an English context, \nthese broad tensions and challenges that emerge from the research findings are likely to \nresonate with academic developers internationally. \n \n\u2022 the significance of professional status; \n\u2022 the influence of misaligned initiatives and priorities; \n\u2022 the influence of supportive networks. \n \nThe voices of academics participating in this research reveal all of the complexities \nof human deliberations and decision making, \u2018using their own descriptions\u2019 (Archer, 2007, \np. 12) that result in intentions and expectations. It is therefore evident that institutions \nthrough academic and educational developers, might achieve a more inclusive and holistic \napproach to academics\u2019 development by responding to the concerns of academics and \nengaging them in a construction of academic professionalism. However, the status of \n\u2018professional\u2019 \u2018needs to be earned\u2019 and includes \u2018responsibility\u2019 (McLean, 2008, p. 125). \nTherefore whilst there is a right to participate and be listened to, there is a corresponding \nobligation to engage. The implications of what might be termed \u2018academic citizenship\u2019 \n(Macfarlane, 2007) would include responsibilities related to one\u2019s own and others\u2019 \nprofessional development through overt engagement, articulation, supportive and sharing \npractice, and mentoring.  \n \neschew[ing] managerial and technical versions [of professionalism] for a construction that \nincludes acting expertly, critically, morally and responsibly in respect of all the functions of \nthe university \u2026 could lead to involvement in shaping the future (McLean, 2008, p. 125, italics \nin original). \n \n 17\nAcknowledgement \nThis research was made possible by the hospitality, interest and honesty of participants in \nthe case study institutions; their receptiveness to this research has been very much \nappreciated \nReferences \n\u00c5kerlind, G.
