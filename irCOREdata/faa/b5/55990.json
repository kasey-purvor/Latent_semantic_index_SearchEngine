Currently the European Credit Transfer \nSystem is the most widely used mechanism to enable credit transfer between universities in \ndifferent EU nations.  Using data from 20 universities in four EU states, this paper examines \nthe problems of calculating and using ECTS grades.  The results demonstrate that the \nalignment of ECTS grades varies within nation states and show that, despite the fact that \nECTS grading is a norm referenced system, while the national systems are usually criterion \nreferenced, many ECTS conversion tables provided by universities indicate straight line \ntransference from institutional to ECTS grades . Given the anticipated increase in student \nmobility following the EU enlargement to 25 nations, the paper proposes a re-alignment of \nECTS towards a criterion referenced system.  Such a new system would acknowledge and \nbuild on the diversity of EU higher education systems, unlike the current mechanistic system, \nwhich both masks this diversity and is flawed in calculation, and ad hoc in operation. \nIntroduction \nThe process of the convergence of European higher education systems began at the Sorbonne \non May 25th 1998 when the Education Ministers from France, Germany, Italy and the United \nKingdom signed a Joint Declaration On Harmonisation Of The Architecture Of The \nEuropean Higher Education System committing their nations to \u201cencouraging a common \nframe of reference, \u2026 (to) \u2026 create a European area of higher education.\u201d(Allegre et al. \n1998).  The four signatories successfully called on other European Union (EU) Member \nStates, and other European countries, to join them in this objective, with the result that the \nBologna Declaration was signed on 19th June 1999 by the national government Ministers in \ncharge of higher education of 29 European nations, including all the (then) members of the \nEU. \np.1 \nA major driver of the process of convergence of the EU higher education systems has \nbeen the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS), which led the Ministers who produced the \nBerlin Communiqu\u00e9 in September 2003 to \u201cstress the important role played by the European \nCredit Transfer System (ECTS) in facilitating student mobility and international curriculum \ndevelopment. (and) \u2026 note that ECTS is increasingly becoming a generalised basis for the \nnational credit systems\u201d(2003, p. 4).  Research undertaken by Reichert and Tauch (2003) for \nthe European University Association confirmed \u201ca high degree of acceptance and momentum \nfor this once controversial tool has been reached almost all over Europe \u2026 ECTS has spread \nfast all over Europe and has been included in many higher education laws\u201d (p.66).  However, \nthey also reported that \u201cECTS as a tool is undergoing rapid and far-reaching extensions before \nit has been properly understood in its original form in many institutions. \u2026 the system is still \napplied in a very rudimentary or haphazard fashion to student exchange and credit \ntransfer\u201d(p.66). \nThis paper examines the application of the ECTS grading system, and its different use \nby individual universities, within national systems of assessment.  In order to determine the \npolicy context for this analysis, and the importance of credit issues, the paper initially outlines \nthe central role of credit and assessment within the emerging global market for higher \neducation, before examining the use of ECTS as a mechanism for facilitating credit transfer \nthrough national case studies.  The implications of these findings are then considered within \nan assessment of the requirements of a grading system for European higher education. \nCredit and Credit Transfer in the global H.E. market \nCredits for qualifications are the currency of the emerging borderless higher education market \nplace, and credit transfer systems like ECTS define the rate of exchange.  The ability of \nuniversities to deal with credit and assessment issues will affect their success within the \nglobal knowledge economy and the information society.  If universities do not offer units with \nwidely accepted credit values, they will be unable to attract students from both home and \noverseas markets, who will not enter programmes if the resultant qualifications have limited \nrecognition elsewhere, with other universities and employers.  In essence, universities need to \ndevelop a \u201cglobal currency for higher education qualifications\u201d (Randall, 2002) because if \ntheir programs don\u2019t provide credits that are recognised, they will be denied access to the new \nglobal educational market at a time, the OECD (2000) has calculated, of \u201crapid growth in the \nnumber of students enrolled educational institutions outside their home country\u201d(p. 91).   \nConversely, universities that cannot recognise the credits of other institutions will be unable \np.2 \nto recruit students, especially post-graduates, both from other institutions providing accredited \nacademic qualifications and also from professional associations and organisations that \ncertificate vocational practice and experience.  Furthermore, incoming academic staff will \njudge the credibility of a recruiting university in terms of the value attributed to its \nqualifications by students, by other universities, and the distribution of its alumni within elite \nuniversities and multi-national companies.  In addition, the encroachment of market forces in \neducation and the adoption of consumerist attitudes by students, many of whom study while \nworking and pay tuition fees themselves, necessitates assessment procedures and protocols \nthat are sufficiently well-grounded and professional in execution to address both institutional \naudit by the growing number of national and supra-national quality agencies (e.g. the \nEuropean Network for Quality Assurance in Higher Education), and the growing possibility \nof litigation action by dissatisfied students.  At a strategic level, the inability of universities to \nalign their credit systems to others will limit the possibility of building critical mass in the \nglobal borderless education market by collaboration, not only with other universities, but with \nother major knowledge-centred corporate players. \nIf credits are viewed as the currency within the new global borderless education \nmarket, then assessment and grading procedures can be considered as the die-stamping \npresses through which students process subject content to create this coinage.  However, even \nif courses provided by two different universities have identical subject content and are worth \nthe same value in respect of credits, their entire rationale may be different by virtue of \ndifferent assessment modes and grading procedures.  Moreover, within Europe, different \nnational educational systems utilise widely varying assessment procedures, marking systems, \nand grading schemes, and within each of those national systems there is institutional variance \nin how national procedures are interpreted and used. As Guy Haug (1997) has remarked \n\u201cGrading systems differ in philosophy and practice from one country to another, and the fair \ninterpretation of foreign grades into national ones is a major issue, both for students returning \nafter a study period abroad and for university staff required to assess the credentials of foreign \napplicants.\u201d \nThe European Credit Transfer System \nWithin the EU, the well-known Erasmus (European Action Scheme for the Mobility of \nUniversity Students) program has become, as de Wit (1996) notes  \u201cthe key motor for \ninternationalisation of higher education in the European Union \u2026 complemented by similar \nprograms on a global scale: the TEMPUS program for cooperation with Central and Eastern \np.3 \nEurope\u201d(p.6).  Maiworm and Teichler (1997) have confirmed the evident success of the \nscheme \u2013 the number of Erasmus students exceeded one million students by October 2002, \nleading the (then) European Commissioner for Education and Culture, Vivienne Reding \n(2003a), to \u201curge the Ministers to join forces with public and private sponsors in order to \ntriple the number of Erasmus students by 2010.\u201d  Involvement in programmes such as \nErasmus by European Universities, has promoted greater use of credit transfer between \ninstitutions and across different educational systems.  The extension of support funding via \nthe new Erasmus Mundus programme will permit even greater student mobility, by \nencouraging the inflow of students from outside the EU. \nThe European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) was developed by the European \nCommission to enable the recognition of study periods abroad, funded under the Erasmus and \nsimilar programmes, and comprises three constituent elements: \n\u0089 An information pack\/course catalogue for incoming students from outside the nation \nof the host institution which includes: \n\u0089 A learning agreement specifying the courses to be taken, and agreed by the student \nand his home university and the host university; \n\u0089 A transcript of records detailing the students performance in the courses taken, \ncalculated in the local grading system and ECTS grades.   \nThe marking schemes utilised within the higher education systems of the EU vary \nconsiderably and ECTS is designed to act as a \u201cgrade converter\u201d, enabling students to \ntransport the grade outcomes of their studies quickly and easily across national boundaries.  \nThe ECTS grades a student is granted for courses undertaken at a foreign university are \ndetermined by use of the ECTS Grade Definition table, given below.   \nTable 1 ECTS Grade Definitions \n \nECTS \nGrade \n% of students \nachieving the grade \nDefinition \n \nA 10 Excellent \u2013 outstanding performance with only minor errors \nB 25 Very Good \u2013 above the average standard but with some errors \nC 30 Good \u2013 generally sound work but with a number of notable errors \nD 25 Satisfactory \u2013 fair but with significant shortcomings \nE 10 Sufficient \u2013 performance meets the minimum criteria \nFX  Fail - some more work required before the credit can be awarded \nF  Fail - considerable further work is required \n \nSource: http:\/\/europa.eu.int\/comm\/education\/programmes\/socrates\/ects_en.html \n \n The ECTS uses norm-referencing for the calculation of grades.  All students \nsuccessfully passing the evaluation or examination are listed from that with the highest mark \nto that with the lowest.  Then, within the list, the precise grade points for the five different \np.4 \nECTS percentile groups from \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018E\u2019 are established and lines drawn to indicate the \ndividing points between: \n\u2018A\u2019 = the top ten percentile; \n\u2018B\u2019 = the next twenty five percentile; \n\u2018C\u2019 = the next thirty percentile; \n\u2018D\u2019 = the next twenty five percentile; \n\u2018E\u2019 = the remaining ten percentile. \nBy 2003 Reichert and Tauch found that two thirds of HEIs use ECTS for credit transfer but \nobserved \u201cThe basic elements and principles of ECTS seem simple enough, but its \nimplementation in the highly differentiated European higher education systems is fraught with \nall sorts of problems\u201d (p.70).  It is to some of those problems that we now turn. \nProblems in Calculating ECTS \nThe wide spread use of ECTS seemingly attests to its simplicity in calculating grades and its \nease of use.  However, problems can occur in calculating ECTS grades.  First, ECTS grades \nare only calculated for those students who pass the unit, and the differences in the setting of \npass marks means that that the percentage of students who fail an evaluation\/examination can \nvary from one country\/institution\/faculty\/department\/subject area to another.  Hence in one \nnation the ECTS will be calculated on the basis of the 60% of students on a course who \nachieve a pass, while the same students taking a similar course in another country may find \nthat the ECTS grades are calculated only for 40%, as the pass mark in the second university is \nhigher.   Secondly, in order to calculate students ECTS accurately, it is necessary to use \nhistorical data from the same course, to get sufficient information to ensure that the mark \ndistribution is an accurate reflection of spread of marks for the course.  The amount of \nhistorical data needed will vary depending on the number of students taking the course, but \ntypically, data over a four year period will be needed for accurate norm referencing.  It is then \npossible to identify the ECTS grading boundaries and award the correct grades.  However, \nthis approach has limited utility in the first few years of a new course, when it is also more \nlikely that student numbers taking the unit will be low.  Moreover using this method means \nthat the student\u2019s performance is not being measured against the current cohort of students but \nhistorically against all previous students.  This can clearly create unfair anomalies as the \ncourse content will vary over time, as knowledge within the particular subject area develops, \nwhile changes in staff turnover may mean that the course is both delivered and assessed \ndifferently, from one year to the next.  In addition the requirement of each university to retain \np.5 \nand update a data base covering students results for a four year period makes the system both \nbureaucratically burdensome and time consuming. \nA further problem with ECTS calculation is that some European higher education \nassessment systems have very few grade points.  For example within the Spanish system \nsuccessful students are awarded one of six grades from 5-10 on a grading scale of 0-10, with \nfive as the pass grade.  Similarly in Finland the grades go from 1 (V\u00e4ltt\u00e4v\u00e4 = Sufficient) to 3 \n(Erinomaiset Tiedot = Excellent), with intermediate grades used in some institutions, but not \nall.  Hence using these national grading scales results in very large students groups, which \ncannot be easily mapped on to the ECTS system.  Introducing intermediate grade points \nwithin the national system for the assessment of foreign students units can overcome this \nproblem, although staff may find it difficult to assign intermediate grades that are in \ncontravention of national schemes and academic customs.  This problem is heightened when \nthe national grading scheme is descriptive and non-numeric, as in the case of Sweden where \nstudents are allocated three non numeric grades: Rest (Conditional Pass), Godk\u00e4nd (Pass), or \nV\u00e4l Godk\u00e4nd, (Pass with distinction).  In such circumstances it becomes necessary to use a \nqualitative approach and attempt to match the verbal descriptions used within the ECTS \ngrading system against the national grading descriptors.  Although this can be done, it is an \nimperfect process, given that that terms used for ECTS grades (\u2018excellent\u2019, \u2018very good\u2019, \n\u2018good\u2019, \u2018satisfactory\u2019, \u2018sufficient\u2019) have different national, cultural and academic nuances, and \ncan be interpreted in very different ways, across Europe, given that as Yorke (2001) has noted \n\u201cMuch practice in the area of grading appears to be based on tradition, with whatever thinking \nthat originally underpinned this having been become lost in the mists of time.\u201d (p. 61) \nProblems in Using ECTS \nThe grading mechanisms of some national h.e. systems can make the calculation of ECTS \ndifficult, but the majority utilise numeric systems, and are sufficiently comprehensive to allow \nECTS grades to be calculated.  However, further more serious problems occur with the use, \nrather than the calculation, of the ECTS grading system.  First, the vast majority of grading \nsystems used in higher education in EU nation states are criterion referenced and hence \nattempt to determine a student\u2019s grade by comparing his or her achievements with implicit or \nexplicit stated standards for particular levels of performance.  Hence it is possible that all \nstudents on a course could receive very high (or very low) grades depending on the levels of \nindividuals\u2019 performance against the established criteria.  However even if all students on a \ncourse passed with very low grades via criterion referenced marking, 10% of them would, \np.6 \nnevertheless, be allocated an ECTS Grade \u2018A\u2019, through its norm referenced system.  \nConversely, as norm referencing means that a student\u2019s grade depends not only on his or her \nlevel of achievement, but also on the achievement of others, a student may obtain a high grade \nvia criterion referenced marking, but still be only given an ECTS Grade \u2018C\u2019, as his\/her peers \nalso obtained high grades via criterion referenced marking.  \nSecondly, difficulties arise when trying to fairly and consistently interpret ECTS \ngrades awarded in other institutions, as it is up to the receiving institution as to how it \ninterprets an ECTS grade awarded to a student by another university.  Hence a student \nobtaining the grade of 30 e lode for a course offered by an Italian University would probably \nbe given an ECTS \u2018A\u2019 grade, while students awarded 29 and 30 would be given a grade \u2018B\u2019.  \nHence translating ECTS grade into (say) a British equivalent is difficult as Italian Universities \ndesignate circa 14% of all grades at 30 e lode, while in the U.K. typically only 8% of students \nare awarded first-class honours, moreover there is huge subject variation within the grading \nsystem of the U.K.  Hence for example, Yorke et al. (2002) found that 22% of U.K. first \ndegree awards in Mathematics were at first class honours level, while the comparable figure \nfor first class honours in Law degree awards was only 4.1%.  Moreover Chapman (1997) \nreported \u201csignificant differences in degree class distributions for the same subject between \none university and another\u201d(p.151).  Similarly, raw data gathered by the author from one \nItalian University indicated that (as in the U.K.) there are subject differences in the mark \nspreads within Italian Universities.  It is likely that in other nations there are variations \nbetween subjects in the proportions of different grades awarded, but these variations will be \ndifferent in different nations.  In another country, for example, it may be the case that 10% of \nLaw students get the highest grade, while the comparable figure for Mathematics is less than \n5%. \nThirdly, and most critically, custom and practice have tended to move the perception \n(and use) of ECTS away from norm to criterion referencing.  For example, the detailed ECTS \nGuidance Notes provided for Latvian Universities (now seeking to participate in European \nHigher Education Area) by the national Academic Program Agency (n.d.) state:  \nIt is quite possible that, once the percentile groups represented by the ECTS grades \nfrom \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018E\u2019 have been established, one or more of them may be found to equate \nvery closely to such groups established by the local grading scale.  This \ncoincidence may be close enough for it to be possible to award, year-on-year, the \nECTS grades according to groups created by the local grading scale. \u2026 Where \nnear total correspondence has proved possible between a local grading scale and \np.7 \nthe ECTS grading scale, some institutions have been able to print \u2018straight-line\u2019 \nconversion tables from their local grades into ECTS grades. \u2026 institutions which \ndiscover clear and direct lines of comparison with ECTS grades are greatly \nencouraged to exploit this coincidence. (p. 4f) \nSimilarly the English ECTS Guidance notes issued by the Europa Website (n.d.) state: \u201cin \nassigning an ECTS grade \u2018A\u2019, a British institution awarding first-class honours to 8% of its \nstudents may well decide to retain the same definition of \u2018Excellence\u2019 for the ETCS Grade.\u201d  \nSuch strategies, where adopted, represent a corruption of the norm referenced rationale behind \nECTS, and moreover could disadvantage students.  More fundamentally, it is difficult to \nendorse a grading scheme in which the student\u2019s award may ultimately depend on the \nsuccessful exploitation of coincidence. \nStudents\u2019 understanding of the mechanisms of assessment and grading are critical \ngiven that, as Brown (2001) observed \u201cassessment defines what students regard as important, \nhow they spend their time and how they come to see themselves as students and graduates\u201d \n(p. 4).  Hence a student taking an ECTS graded unit will ask the local tutor how much effort \nwill be needed for a pass and an ECTS  \u2018A\u2019 grade.  Successful exploitation of the happy \ncoincidence between the norm referenced ECTS and institutional and national criterion \nreferenced grading systems is apparently widespread, making it simple to advise incoming \nstudents how much effort is required to gain the different norm referenced ECTS grades, and \nhow these relate to the internal institutional and national grading systems, which are usually \ncriterion referenced.   \nHowever, case study evidence gathered from 20 European Universities, as part of an \nEU Socrates Minerva project, points to huge variation in the ways in which \ninstitutional\/national grades are related to ECTS grades.  Despite the fact that ECTS grading \nis a norm referenced system, while the national systems are usually criterion referenced, \nECTS conversion tables provided by universities indicate straight line transference from \ninstitutional to ECTS grades, and the use of such tables is not confined to a particular nation, \nbut general across the European Union.  Moreover, in addition to wrongly ascribing norm \nreferenced ECTS grades to national criterion referenced grades, there appears to be little \nnational (or institutional) consistency as to how this procedure is undertaken as the tables \nbelow demonstrate.  It is possible that such inconsistencies may relate to subject differences, \nalthough more usually ECTS conversion tables are supplied on an institutional rather than a \nsubject basis.   \n \np.8 \nTable 2 Use of ECTS in France \n \nECTS  \nGrade \nUniversity 1 \nGrade Description \nUniversity 2  \nGrade Description\nUniversity 3 \nGrade Description\nUniversity 4 \nGrade Description \nUniversity 5 \nGrade Description\nA 16 \u2013 20 Tr\u00e8s Bien \n18-20  \nExcellent \n> or = 14.5 Tr\u00e8s \nBien & Bien \n16 ou plus \nExcellent \n>15 \nExcellent \nB 14 \u2013 16 Bien \n16-18 \nTr\u00e8s Bien \n> or = 13 Bien \n& Assez Bien \n14 \nTr\u00e8s Bien \n15-12 \nTr\u00e8s Bien \nC 12 - 14 Assez Bien \n14-16 \nBien \n> or = 11.7 \nAssez Bien \n12 \nBien \n12-10 \nBien \nD 10 - 12  Passable \n12-14 Satisfaisant > or = 11 \nPassable \n11 \nSatisfaisant \n10-8  \nSatisfaisant \nE  08-12 Passable > or = 10 Passable \n10 \nPassable \n8-6 \nPassable \nFX Inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 10 Echec \n00-08 Insuffisant <10 \nEchec \n8 ou 9 \nInsuffisant \n<6 \nInsuffisant \nF   < 6 Echec probant \n7 ou moins \nEchec \n \n \nSources: http:\/\/www.ensm-douai.fr\/fr\/gbversion\/studying.html \n http:\/\/www.ema.fr\/infos_international\/ECTS-03-04\/2003-ects-info.html \n http:\/\/www.icmo.u-psud.fr\/w-erasmus\/ae_depgene.htm \n http:\/\/www.psycho.univ-paris5.fr\/html\/NKMS34DWQXPXPZ2H.shtml \n http:\/\/www.ensc-lille.fr\/int_fr\/ECTS\/echelle.html \n \nAs can be seen from table 2 above, Universities 2 and 5 in France would award the \nECTS Grade \u2018E if a student achieved 8 out of 20 in an examination, while the other three \nwould not.

At the lower end of the scale there is some unanimity about what \nconstitutes a fail, but three institutions truncate ECTS Grades \u2018FX\u2019 and \u2018F\u2019. \nTable 3 Use of ECTS in Greece \n \nECTS \ngrade \nUniversity 1 \nGrade Description\nUniversity 2  \nGrade Description \nUniversity 3 \nGrade Description\nUniversity 4 \nGrade Description \nUniversity 5 \nGrade Description\nA 9.0 to 10: Excellent \n8.5 to 10 \nExcellent \nExcellent \n10 \nB 8 to 8.5: Very Good \n7 to 8.4 \nVery Good \nExcellent \n8.50 - 10 \nExcellent \n8.50 - 10 Very Good \n8, 9 \nC 7 to 7.5: Good \n6 to 6.9 \nGood \nVery Good \n7.0 - 8.4 \nVery Good \n6.5 - 8.49 \nGood \n7 \nD 6 to 6.5: Satisfactory \n5.1 to 5.9 \nSatisfactory \nGood \n5.1 - 6.9 \nGood \n5.01 - 6.49 \nAlmost Good \n6 \nE 5 to 5.9: Sufficient \n5 Lowest \nPassing Grade \nPassing Grade \n5 \nPassing Grade \n5 \n5 Passing Grade \nFX 4 to 4.5 Fail \n4 to 4.9 \nInsufficient \nF 0 to 3.5 Fail \n0 to 3.9 \nFail \nFail \n0 - 4.9 \nFail \n0 - 4.49 \nFail \n \np.9 \n Sources: http:\/\/www.tuc.gr\/english\/erasmus\/pem.doc \n http:\/\/www.teipat.gr\/pages\/civil\/dept_e.htm \n http:\/\/www.nutr.teithe.gr\/engcourseofstudy.htm \n http:\/\/ www.csd.auth.gr\/download\/ects_en.doc \n http:\/\/www.med.auth.gr\/school\/eng\/depart.htm \n \nThe assignment of norm referenced ECTS Grades to national criterion referenced \ngrades appears more uniform in Italy (see Table 4 below), as 30 or 30 e lode usually \ncorresponds with the ECTS Grade \u2018A\u2019, while a mark of 18 or more is sufficient to pass.  \nHowever there is considerable variation in the calculation of intermediate grades.

Most students using the possibility of Erasmus funding opt to study at one \nother university, but for this example the hypothetical assumption has been made that two \nstudents are studying for units at universities in France, Greece, Italy and the Netherlands.  \nBoth students have been awarded the same above average grades via the national marking \nsystem scoring 15\/20 in the French University, 7.4\/10 in the Greece University, 28\/30 in the \nItalian University and 7.3\/10 in the University in the Netherlands.  However, one student has \nstudied at University 3 in France, University 2 in Greece, University 4 in Italy and University \n3 in the Netherlands \u2013 this lucky choice and the exploitation of the happy coincidence \nbetween ECTS and national grades has enabled the students to achieve two ECTS Grade \u2018A\u2019s, \nand two Grade \u2018B\u2019s.  By contrast the other student has unluckily chosen to study at University \n2 in France, University 1 in Greece, University 3 in Italy and University 5 in the Netherlands, \nand although achieving the same marks as his lucky counterpart is only able to achieve three \nECTS Grade \u2018C\u2019s and one Grade \u2018D\u2019.  \nTable 6 Summary Table- Best and Worst Scenarios \n \nNation and Local Score France  \n15\/20 \nGreece \n7.4\/10 \nItaly \n28\/30 \nNetherlands \n7.3\/10 \nUniversity 1: ECTS Grade B C B D \nUniversity 2: ECTS Grade C B B C \nUniversity 3: ECTS Grade A C C B \nUniversity 4: ECTS Grade B C A D \nUniversity 5: ECTS Grade B B B D \nLucky Student A B A B \nUnlucky Student C C C D \np.11 \nConclusions and Recommendations \nA macro level analysis of ECTS by Adams (2001a) for the European Commission found that \n\u201cThe current state of the SOCRATES\/ERASMUS ECTS is relatively healthy and buoyant. It \nis accepted and used by over one thousand higher education institutions. The tools it uses are \ntried and tested and have been shown to be effective. The principles on which it is based are \nsound\u201d (p. 19).  The increased use of ECTS has lead Adams (2001b) to assert that \u201cECTS is \nbeing transformed from an important but peripheral activity to something at the heart of \nnational and institutional education. ECTS is now moving centre-stage as a device to meld \nerstwhile incompatible educational systems and practices\u201d (p. 36).  By contrast, Sullivan\u2019s \n(2002) more recent micro level institutional study of ECTS based on anecdotal evidence from \nan exchange between a Swedish and UK university concluded that \u201cneither is ECTS grade \ntransfer the simple matter that university literature promoting SOCRATES purports, nor does \nthe transferred grade reflect a similar level of achievement to that which the home university \nclaims to assume\u201d (p. 73).  This analysis verifies this study and endorses Van Damme\u2019s \n(2001) criticism of ECTS that \u201cIn its pragmatic and voluntaristic approach and with its \nreliance on a great deal of optimistic (some would say \u2018naive\u2019) trust and confidence, it has \nchosen to bypass questions of content comparability, educational culture and, of crucial \nimportance, quality\u201d (p. 435).  Similarly, Haug (1997) believes that \u201cforeign grades are not \njust numbers that can be calculated by applying a mathematical formula, but a message that \nneeds first to be understood in the original system and in a second stage interpreted by users \nin their own system.  Simple mathematical formulas with their claim to universality are \nnothing but a fallacious oversimplification of a reality they fail to capture.\u201d  As well as \nrevealing problems with the application of ECTS grades, the tables above also expose \ninstitutional variation in the use of national grading systems.  This variation is neither \nconducive to accurate international credit transfer, nor suggestive of robust national quality \nassurance procedures that safeguard students\u2019 interests by applying national grading standards \nconsistently, both within institutions and between subject departments. \nThe increase in the number of European Union nation states in May 2004 from 15 to 25, \nall with their own cultural norms and nationally distinct systems of grading and assessment, \nprovides an apposite moment to appraise the existing institutional usage of the ECTS, to \ncheck that it is operating fairly and equitably and in the interest of students, before attempting \nto extend its use to the new members of the EU.  Currently ECTS: \np.12 \n\u0089 calculates grades on different sizes of student cohorts depending on where the pass \nmark is set by the university running the course \u2013 where the pass mark for a unit is \n50% and habitually only 70% of students achieve a pass grade, it is likely that the \nECTS Grading will be applied to a smaller student cohort than if the pass mark is set \nat 40% and 80% of students are anticipated to pass; \n\u0089 uses a norm based referencing system and thereby calculates students\u2019 grades in \naccordance with the performance of their peers, rather than via a criterion referencing \nsystem which judges the student\u2019s ability to achieve the learning outcomes of courses; \n\u0089 may wrongly penalise or reward students, depending on whether there have been \nchanges to the course delivery and assessment over the period from which data is \ncollected; \n\u0089 has national coherence in some EU nations, and is applied accurately, but is wrongly \napplied as if it were a criterion referenced system in others, and even then, applied \ndifferently by individual institutions. \nAny assessment and grading system utilised across the EU must address the needs of a \nhierarchy of stakeholders and potentials users, including students (seeking credits for \nacademic advancement), teaching staff (assessing the impact of their efforts), universities \n(ensuring national and institutional quality standards are met), employers (trying to recruit \nqualified staff), governments (pursuing national policy objectives), and the EU (trying to \ncreate the European H.E. Area).  Currently it is debatable whether ECTS is meeting the \ndiverse needs of these (and other) stakeholders.  At the very least any grading system adopted \nat European level must be able to: \n\u0089 apply uniform pass\/fail benchmarks to enable progression; \n\u0089 enable identification of excellence, permitting entry to higher degrees; \n\u0089 allow students to accurately monitor their learning progress; \n\u0089 monitor the impact of teaching; \n\u0089 provide a differentiated ranking of grades to reflect a range of different abilities \nagainst agreed standards of knowledge and competence; \n\u0089 encourage students to strive for excellence \u2013 all grades must be achievable; \n\u0089 enable retrieval of failure without loss of recognition for the grade; \n\u0089 be universally applicable across a range of disciplines and nations, in an easy, \ntransparent, and equitable fashion. \nAt present ECTS does not meet these requirements.  Largely because, as Adams (2001c) \nadmits, \u201cThe main problems are that ECTS is not always consistently applied, nor is it always \np.13 \nproperly understood\u201d (p.297).  More critically however, within its adoption there is a move \nbeing encouraged to equate ECTS norm referenced grades with national criterion referenced \ngrades, in a manner which is ad hoc and unsystematic.  Moreover the wide spread use and \nvery simplicity of the ECTS has given it a highly misleading \u201cveneer of validity, reliable and \nstandard maintenance\u201d (Sullivan, 2002, p.73). \nTo enable EU universities to compete in the global borderless educational market, the \nECTS should be as coherent and robust as that used in other major trading blocs.  Before \nECTS is installed as the norm in the accession states, work should be undertaken to re-align \nECTS from a norm to a criterion referenced system.  This would involve applying new \nparameters to the ECTS categories, in terms of scores within the national grading systems, \nsuch that (for example) a student scoring 27-29 for a unit studied at an Italian University \nwould always be awarded an ECTS grade \u2018B\u2019, irrespective as to the grades obtained by his \ncurrent or previous fellow students.  Such a re-calibration of ECTS grades would have a direct \nsymmetry with, and would strengthen, the shift towards defining ECTS credits in terms of \nachieving learning outcomes rather than study hours taken.  Indeed, there is little point in \nutilising learning outcomes within credit definitions unless they are used with a criterion \nreferenced marking scheme which assesses the extent to which the outcomes are achieved by \nstudents.  Work undertake by Morrison et al. (1997) indicates that it would be possible to \ncreate \u201cA Europe-wide uniform mark scale (which) would ensure that all universities could \nquickly appraise the academic profile of a visiting student by glancing at his or her \nachievements to date, calibrated in uniform marks\u201d (p.412).  In addition, the current \nmechanistic mode of calculating ECTS, masks rather than celebrates the strengths and \ndiversity of national h.e. systems, and does not encourage academic staff to understand the \nrationale and benefits of marking schemes in other nation states.  A further benefit of such an \nappraisal would be to increase the consistency of national assessment and grading systems \nwithin the universities of individual EU nations. \nThe highly complex but successful creation of the Euro as a common currency in \nJanuary 2002, replacing the many different national currencies that then existed, and enabling \na free flow of goods and services across the European area, shows that such reforms, although \nradical, are both feasible and beneficial.  Similarly, to maximize the returns of the emerging \nEuropean knowledge economy, knowledge, in the form of credits, must be easily portable \nbetween states and across borders.  The mobility of knowledge would benefit greatly from \nhaving a common currency of standard academic grades and thereby portable qualifications, \nenabling free flow for the knowledge of its citizens with consequent rises in student and \np.14 \nlabour mobility.  In her address at the Berlin Bologna meeting in September 2003, Viviane \nReding (2003b) told the Higher Education Ministers that \u201cQuality Assurance \u2026 is really at \nthe heart of the Bologna process and deserves its prominent place in our draft Communiqu\u00e9.\u201d \nand stated that she was \u201clooking at ways in which the Commission can help greater \nconsistency in the use of ECTS.\u201d  This study suggests that if quality assurance procedures in \ncredit transference between EU nation states are to operate properly and fairly, the ECTS \ngrading process will need to move to a criterion referenced system, while both national and \nECTS grading procedures will need to be applied with much greater consistency at both \ninstitutional and national levels, if they are to retain the credibility of the academic staff and \nstudents who use them.   \nREFERENCES \nADAM, S., (2001a) Report For The European Commission: ECTS Extension Feasibility \nProject accessed from http:\/\/europa.eu.int\/comm\/education\/programmes\/socrates\/ectsrap.pdf \non 10 June 2004. \nADAM, S., (2001b) Credit Recognition And Transparency In Transnational Education, \nEuropean Journal of Legal Education, Vol.1, p. 35- 42. \nADAM, S., (2001c) A Pan-European Credit Accumulation Framework \u2013 Dream or Disaster?, \nHigher Education Quarterly,  55(3), pp. 293-305. \nALLEGRE, C., BERLINGUER, L., BLACKSTONE, T., R\u00dcTTGERS, J., (1998) Sorbonne \nJoint Declaration On Harmonisation Of The Architecture Of The European Higher Education \nSystem, Paris, the Sorbonne, May 25 1998. \nBROWN, G., (2001), \u201cAssessment: A Guide for Lecturers\u201d, LTSN Generic Centre \nAssessment Series No. 3, (York: LTSN). \nCHAPMAN, K., (1997), \u201cDegrees of Difference: Variability of Degree Results in UK \nUniversities\u201d, Higher Education, 33 (?), p.137-153. \nCONFERENCE OF EU HIGHER EDUCATION MINISTERS, (2003) Communiqu\u00e9: \nRealising the European Higher Education Area. \nDE WIT, H., (1996), European Internationalization Programs, International Higher \nEducation, 4, p.5-6. \nEUROPEAN COMMISSION, (2004) European Credit Transfer System: ECTS Users\u2019 Guide, \naccessed from http:\/\/europa.eu.int\/comm\/education\/programmes\/socrates\/ects\/guide_en.pdf \non 10th August 2004. \np.15 \nHAUG, G., (1997) Capturing the Message Conveyed by Grades: Interpreting Foreign Grades, \nWorld Education News and Reviews, 10, 2. \nLATVIAN ACADEMIC PROGRAM AGENCY, (n.d.)
