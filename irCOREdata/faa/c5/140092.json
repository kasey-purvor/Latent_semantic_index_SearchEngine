Introduction \nOptical fiber systems have made great impact in the field of sensing thanks to the growth of the \noptoelectronics and fiber-optic communication industries. Many of the components used in these \nmarkets were devised benefiting from outstanding technologies in the design of materials, optical \nfibers and light sources. The inherent advantages of fiber optic sensors include their light weight, low \ncost, small size and ruggedness, making it possible to directly install and integrate them in \nenvironments with access difficulty. The immunity to electromagnetic interference, high bandwidth \nand response are crucial for high sensitivity and high accuracy sensing. The past 20 years have \nwitnessed an intensive research effort on the use of optical fiber sensors to measure different physical \nand chemical parameters [1,2]. \nAmong the optical sensors, FBGs have been demonstrated to be very promising as mechanical \nprobes for a number of applications. Several interrogation systems have been developed so far, often \nbased on broad-emission radiation sources in conjunction with either optical spectrum analyzers or \nfilters [3,4]. More recently, sophisticated schemes based on narrow-band laser sources and  \nlaser-frequency stabilization methods were devised, achieving strain sensitivity at the 10-12 level and \nbetter for quasi-static and dynamic monitoring [5-7]. Among them, a significant contribution came \nfrom the use of FBG-based resonant structures whose highly-dispersive power near resonance is \nexploited to measure sub-pm length perturbations over a wide range of frequencies. On the other hand, \noptical resonators based on high-reflectivity FBGs, fiber loops and silica microspheres have been \nemployed for refractive index and gas sensing. Cavity-enhanced and ring-down techniques enable the \nextraction of information on light-matter interaction in direct or evanescent-wave spectroscopy \nschemes [8-10]. \n2. Strain and Temperature Sensing \n2.1. Bragg Gratings in Highly-Birefringent (HiBi) Fibers \nDespite the sensitivity achievable using systems based on laser-spectroscopy techniques or fiber \ninterferometers [6,11,12], a quantitative measurement at very-low frequency (approaching DC) is \naffected by temperature cross-sensitivity that may limit the ultimate measurement accuracy. This is \nparticularly relevant for field applications where a continuous and reliable operation is required \noutdoor. A number of solutions which have been proposed to avoid such limitation include the use of \nreference sensors, two-wavelengths FBGs, chirped gratings and birefringent fibers, but often with \nserious degradation of the measurement precision [13]. Here, we combine the advantages of  \nlaser-spectroscopic methods, which improve detection sensitivity, with the use of FBG sensors \nfabricated in HiBi (Panda) fibers to simultaneously monitor temperature and strain [14]. We describe \nthe proposed methods, the experimental set-ups and the preliminary results obtained by a single FBG \nand an in-fiber Fabry-P\u00e9rot (FFP) cavity. \nSensors 2010, 10                            \n \n \n1825\nIn a previous paper, we reported on the implementation of a strain sensing apparatus based on a \nfrequency-modulated diode-laser at 1,560 nm, which was aimed at the static and dynamic interrogation \nof single FBGs with improved sensitivity [15]. Our main concern was to achieve a quantitative \nunderstanding of all aspects that influence the performance of such systems. This procedure was \nessential as it enabled further optimization and improvement in the interrogation system, in order to \ndevelop a portable FBG-based sensor with capabilities that are necessary for field use. Figure 1 \nillustrates the basic interrogation scheme. The system relied on radio-frequency (RF) sideband \ngeneration on the laser beam, via current modulation, and heterodyne detection of the FBG reflected \nlight. If the sideband frequency is high enough compared to the FBG width, its reflection spectrum can \nbe treated as a molecular absorption line. Demodulation at that frequency is performed by a  \ndouble-balanced mixer which yields a highly-dispersive signal with a zero-crossing around the \nBragg\u2019s resonance in quiescent conditions. Thus any mechanical strain on the sensor will be converted \ninto a non-zero voltage output. This deviation can be employed as a discriminator (error) for  \nPound-Drever-Hall (PDH) [16] frequency locking of the laser onto the Bragg grating\u2019s peak for \ncontinuous tracking of the sensor.  \nFigure 1.

This is shown in  \nFigure 2. A distributed feedback diode laser (DFBL) and an extended-cavity diode laser (ECL), both \nemitting around 1,560 nm, were equipped with Panda-fiber pig-tails. The lasers were driven by  \nlow-noise current and temperature controllers, and their linear states of polarization (SOP) were \naligned with the fiber\u2019s slow and fast axes, respectively. Sidebands were superimposed on the laser \ncarrier frequencies by applying signals in the GHz range at their bias-tee inputs. DFBL was modulated \nat f1 = 2 GHz while ECL was modulated at f2 = 1 GHz and both were coupled to the FBG through  \na 3 dB PM fiber coupler. The HiBi-grating reflected signal presented two distinct peaks corresponding \nto slow and fast SOPs, which were separated by a polarization splitter and detected by two different \nphotodiodes. A double-balanced mixer (DBM) demodulated the detector voltages at frequency f1,2 and \nyielded dispersive-like signals resulting from the phase shift between sideband-carrier beats [7]. Since \nthe FBG full-width at half maximum (FWHM) was about 7 GHz, a 1\u20132 GHz modulation was able to \nSensors 2010, 10                            \n \n \n1826\ngenerate a suitable error signal. When each laser was resonant with the corresponding FBG peak, the \nmixers provided a voltage crossing zero in correspondence to the maximum reflectivity. DFBL and \nECL gave rise to mixer signals centered at slightly different wavelengths as a consequence of the \nPanda fiber polarization-mode dispersion (~0.16 nm). An example is in Figure 3. These signals were \ndirected to proportional-integrative (PI) electronic loops (acting as servos), which control the laser \ncurrent and the extended-cavity length of the ECL. By active locking of each laser on the FBG peaks, \nthe correction signals serve as real-time monitors of strain over a wide dynamic range. \nFigure 2.

The latter allowed \nexerting an evenly-distributed pressure between two glass surfaces in contact with the fiber. The actual \nSensors 2010, 10                            \n \n \n1827\ndeformations could be readily calibrated using a reference FBG made in a single mode fiber, whose \ngauge factor was preliminarily determined by applying known weights. The single-mode FBG was \nthen attached vertically to the transverse load applied to the PM FBG resulting into axial deformation \nof the single-mode fiber. Temperature variations (\uf044T) could also be imposed on the fiber by means of \na Peltier element in thermal contact with the FBG. Here, the temperature was controlled by a \nproportional-integrative-derivative (PID) stabilizer (resolution \u2248 0.01 \u00b0C) and measured by an AD 590 \nprobe. Once the lasers were locked to the reflection peaks, for a given thermal or mechanical \nperturbation, we analyzed the corresponding changes in the servo feedback signal and retrieved the \nresponse of the PM FBG to these measurands. By comparing all calibrations to the correction signal \nvoltage, we obtained the response factors of the system to \uf065L, \uf065T and \uf044T as a function of the output \nvoltages, i.e., the locking feedback signals of the two crossed-polarized lasers. \nCalibration measurements with the single sensor have been carried out applying longitudinal loads \nusing the PZT in a free-running configuration. In Figure 4, linear fits to the graphs give longitudinal \nstrain responses of 1.26 \u00b1 0.02 pm\/\uf06d\u03b5 and 1.282 \u00b1 0.009 pm\/\uf06d\u03b5 for the slow and fast axes, \nrespectively. Temperature factors obtained for the same FBG were 10.326 \u00b1 0.02 pm\/\u00b0C and 11.858 \u00b1 \n0.2 pm\/\u00b0C for the slow and fast axes respectively (Figure 5). The results for longitudinal strain \nsensitivity of the HiBi FBG are barely distinguishable while temperatures are significantly different. \nNoise effects that limit measurement accuracy, e.g., spurious optical reflections, can be significantly \nreduced by using optical components with better anti-reflection coatings in the polarization analyzer. \nApplication experiments for this technique to the measurement of strain (longitudinal) and \ntemperature, in both dynamic and static modes, have been performed. \nFigure 4.

These signals are currently not corrected for the difference between the two laser servo gains: \nindeed they have opposite sign since the locking correction for the fast SOP is fed back to the injection \ncurrent of the DFB laser, while a PZT is used for low-frequency control of the extended-cavity laser \nfor the fast SOP. The Fourier transform of Figure 6a, shown in Figure 6b, has two marked peaks above \nthe background, corresponding to mechanical (8 Hz) and thermal (0.5 Hz) stress excited in the fiber. A \npreliminary sensitivity estimate, based on the noise floor of Figure 6b, indicates that quasi-static strain \nnear to the 10 n\uf065rms\/\uf0d6Hz level is within the capability of our system. At higher acoustic  \nfrequencies (500\u20151000 Hz), we measured a sensitivity improvement of nearly a factor  \nof 100 (100 p\uf065\/\uf0d6Hz). Analogously, for small temperature changes, a minimum detectable temperature \nvariation of 5 mKrms\/\uf0d6Hz can be extrapolated. \nStrain and temperature variations can be thus detected simultaneously by a single sensor. An \nexperimental test on cross-correlation between transverse strain and longitudinal strain in a dynamic \nmeasurement regime will be the subject of future investigations. \n \n \nSensors 2010, 10                            \n \n \n1829\nFigure 6.

Fiber Bragg-Grating Resonators \nA different kind of apparatus was developed with high-finesse in-fiber Bragg-grating Fabry-P\u00e9rot \n(FFP) resonators as strain sensors. The resonator is formed by two high-reflectivity single-mode FBGs \nat a relative distance of 100 mm. Small optical pathlength variations in the intra-cavity fiber are turned \ninto frequency shift of the narrow resonance. A first demonstration of its sensitivity to strain signals is \ngiven below. Similarly to section 2.1, a diode laser is actively locked to the resonator by an  \noptical-electronic loop. \nFigure 7. Noise spectral density of the FBG-resonator locking signal for different \nexcitation frequencies in the SM-fiber cavity: (a) a sharp peak is evident at 1.2 kHz with a \nnoise increase towards low frequencies and spurious oscillations due to harmonics of the \nAC line frequency; (b) the system is capable of detecting deformations down to 2.4 Hz. \n1 10 100 1000\n1E-12\n1E-11\n1E-10\n1E-9\na)\nSt\nra\nin\n n\noi\nse\n (\uf065\nrm\ns\/H\nz1\n\/2\n)\nFrequency (Hz)  \n0.1 1 10\n1E-11\n1E-10\n1E-9\n1E-8\n1E-7\nSt\nra\nin\n n\noi\nse\n (\uf065\nrm\ns\/H\nz1\n\/2\n)\nFrequency (Hz)\nb)\n \n \nSensors 2010, 10                            \n \n \n1830\nAlthough the interrogating laser can be frequency controlled again by PDH method [7], a different \nscheme, based on polarization-spectroscopy (PS), was devised. The PS technique was an extension of \nthe well-known Hansch-Couillaud scheme [18] and relied on the birefringence induced by FBG \nfabrication in the resonator [19,20]. The error signal was obtained by adjusting the SOP of the laser \nbeam at 45\u00b0 to the fiber birefringence axis and analyzing the cavity-reflected field with a polarization \nanalyzer [21]. In this way, an excellent performance was obtained without using any RF laser \nmodulation or sophisticated electronics. At the same time, a big improvement was obtained by \nreplacing the DFB diode with a narrow-linewidth extended-cavity diode laser. This facilitated the \ninterrogation of the FFP resonances and reduced the noise content of the in-loop signal, deriving from \nconversion of laser-frequency noise into amplitude noise by the cavity. As for PDH, the strain \ninformation is carried by the servo output signal within the locking bandwidth (40 kHz). Signals at \ndifferent frequencies were applied to the intra-cavity fiber by a PZT (\uf07e1 n\u03b5 peak-to-peak strain) \nattached to it and the locking correction signal was analyzed by FFT. Figure 7 shows the sensitivity \nperformance for the PS system, pointing out the strain noise level and the frequency response. The \nminimum detectable strain level was found to be as low as 1 p\u03b5\/\uf0d6Hz, around 1 kHz, and  \nabout 40 p\u03b5\/\uf0d6Hz around 1\u20132 Hz [21]. Work is now in progress to further reduce the effect of  \nfree-running laser jitter via pre-stabilization on an optical frequency reference. \nFigure 8.

The \ninstrumental arrangement is shown in Figure 8, where the FBG sensor has been replaced by an in-fiber \nresonator and only one laser is employed. Two high-reflectivity Panda FBGs (reflectivity \uf07e99 %) were \ncoupled to form a Fabry-P\u00e9rot resonator. The Bragg mirrors were separated by about 50 cm and \nPBS \nSensors 2010, 10                            \n \n \n1831\nenclosed in aluminum cylinders to keep them mechanically isolated. The cavity had a measured \nfinesse of 300. Again the sensitive element was represented by the intra-cavity fiber and thus small \nstrain signals were excited by a PZT placed between the cylinders. In Figure 9, the cavity transmission \nwas recorded when the laser was swept over a large wavelength range. The narrowest resonances, \ncorresponding to the maximum FBG reflectivity, yielded the minimum transmission level as a \nconsequence of internal fiber losses. It is worth noting that two dispersed mode sequences are present, \napparently belonging to different resonators. They have their maximum finesse window centered at \ndifferent wavelengths, as a consequence of the polarization-mode dispersion in HiBi FBG reflectors. \nFurthermore, the internal fiber birefringence removes the usual polarization degeneracy of Fabry-P\u00e9rot \nresonance. Each cavity mode is split into two if the incident SOP is not perfectly oriented along one of \nthe principal axes, i.e., each resonance consists of a \u201cslow\u201d and a \u201cfast\u201d peak. This is clearly visible in \nFigure 10 (upper graph). As in the scheme that was described for PM FBGs, a single laser could be \nfrequency-locked to either of the crossed-polarized peaks using different PDH paths so as to \nindependently interrogate each eigenmode at the same time. Firstly, low-frequency (LF) sidebands  \nat 12 MHz were superimposed to the laser beam for frequency locking. Then another pair of \nsidebands, with relatively strong modulation depth, are generated at about 50 MHz by a tunable  \nvoltage-controlled oscillator (HFVCO). One of them played the role of \u2018secondary\u2019 carrier to \ninterrogate one of the resonances by frequency locking to it. Reflected light from the cavity was \ncollected by a fiber coupler connected to a polarization analyzer (PBS) to discriminate between fast \nand slow eigenmodes. The corresponding beat signals at the LF frequency from the mixers were fed \nback to the laser and the HFVCO by the PI servo for locking the two \u2018carriers\u2019 on the corresponding peaks. \nStatic and dynamic deformations as well as thermal effects on the fiber result in changes of the \noptical pathlength and thus frequency shifts of the resonances, but with different responses along the \nprincipal axes. Strain-induced shifts of the \u201cslow\u201d and \u201cfast\u201d axis resonances were monitored by the \ncorrections generated by the servo loops and sent to the lasers. The calibration procedure could be \nimplemented in the same manner as for a single sensor, provided a reference FBG is used for  \nstrain-to-voltage conversion. \nFigure 9.

Acceleration Measurements by FBG Strain Sensors \nThe monitoring of seismic signals is essential to the study of volcanoes, for surveillance of seismic \nareas or even in anti-intrusion systems for homeland-security. Activity and movement in the earth is \nassociated with mechanical waves that propagate from the source of the disturbance. These waves, \nboth longitudinal and transverse, cause vibrations that can occur over a large frequency span ranging \nfrom quasi-static (below 1 mHz) to acoustic frequencies (above 100 Hz). At present, commercial \naccelerometers generally operate below 100 Hz. This may leave signals at higher frequencies \nundetected. Therefore to fully understand the link between the seismic occurrences and seismic \nsignals, detectors with high bandwidth at high sensitivity are required. Velocities and accelerations can \nbe efficiently measured with fiber-optic sensors, provided the mechanical response of the sensor \nelement is known. Telecommunication technology gave great benefits on FBGs, including the \nprovision of low-loss optical fibers and high-quality, relatively-cheap optical components. Fiber-optic \naccelerometers demonstrate intrinsically-superior sensitivity and small mechanical inertia which \novercome typical limitations of conventional seismic accelerometers, making it possible to access a \nwider acoustic-frequency range. So far, there have been a few examples of fiber-optic accelerometers \naimed at such applications. The possibility of strain-to-acceleration transduction was previously \ndemonstrated using a massive flexural beam sensor monitored by a FBG with basic demodulation \nschemes [22,23]. \nOur first approach was a long-beam horizontal accelerometer, containing three different FBGs, \nwhich were able to monitor deformations of a rigid cylinder in all directions within the horizontal \nplane. A large mass (1 kg) was placed on the top of the cylinder while its base was anchored to the \nground using a special screw (see Figure 12). Three FBG elements were glued into the cylinder \ninternal surface, parallel to the vertical axis, and placed at angles of 120\u00b0 apart. Mechanical waves \ncould be detected in the horizontal plane by at least two sensors for determination of their intensity  \nand direction [24]. \nFigure 12. Sketch of the flexural beam acceleration transducer. \n \n \nAnchor system \nSeismic wave \nConcrete \nConcrete  \nSensors 2010, 10                            \n \n \n1834\nA customized laser-spectroscopic interrogation technique improves the sensitivity and dynamic \nresponse of the system. It relies on two telecom-type DFB diode lasers that track two FBG reflection \nspectra with high spectral resolution. Since a horizontal seismic wave produces an inertial \ndisplacement x (t) of the mass m along the x axis in the cylinder section plane, x (t) can be related to \nthe unknown ground acceleration via a simple mechanical model of the beam, to provide strain to \nacceleration conversion. \nFigure 13.

Particularly, in order to evaluate the sensor response to a seismic \nexcitation, we performed a comparison experiment with a commercial K2 (EpiSensor) accelerometer, \nusing a shaking table to apply acceleration to the system in a controlled manner [24]. The two \ninstruments were time synchronized. With the laser tuned near one side of the FBG response curve, a \nshort-pulse sequence was applied to the cylinder sensor along one of the FBG axial directions, which \nwas parallel to horizontal component of the K2 accelerometer. Examples of the output signals from the \nFBG-sensor and the K2 placed next to it are shown in Figure 13. \nMore recently, we attached three separate \u03c0-shifted FBGs (PSFBGs) to three cantilever beams that \nflex in orthogonal directions [25]. The PSFBGs present a characteristic response which is quite similar \nto common optical resonators [26]. The phase defect in the periodic structure indeed modifies its \nphotonic bandgap and creates a sharp resonance exactly at the Bragg wavelength. That strongly \nimproves the capability of detecting small shifts caused by mechanical action on the fiber. The sensors \nwere interrogated by three distributed feedback lasers actively locked to their central resonance using a \nradio-frequency modulation technique to obtain high sensitivity over a wide dynamic range while \npreserving a large frequency bandwidth. A cantilever consists of a beam attached to a solid base. It can \nbe considered a simple harmonic system where the end of the beam exhibits a displacement that is \nproportional to the applied acceleration and the spring constant of the system. The spring constant can \nSensors 2010, 10                            \n \n \n1835\nbe determined by the Young\u2019s modulus of the material, E, the beam\u2019s moment of inertia, I, and the \nlength of the beam, L using the expression  \n     k \uf03d EI \/L .

A sketch is depicted in Figure 14. This gives the system a resonant \nfrequency of 1,500 Hz, according to Equation 1. The acceleration of each cantilever could be measured \nwith a PS FBG sensor attached on one side of the beam. The three sensors were all fabricated in  \nSMF-28 fiber with comparable envelope reflectivity (>99%) and resonance linewidth (typically \uf07e2 pm), \nbut centered at well separated wavelengths: 1,560, 1,540 and 1,578 nm. For this purpose, three \nseparate distributed-feedback (DFB) diode lasers are locked to PSFBGs at the corresponding \nwavelengths using the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique. An error signal is generated via sideband \nmodulation of the lasers at 60 MHz and phase-sensitive detection of the PS FBG reflection (an \nexample is shown in Figure 15). The error signal is integrated and fed back to the lasers for locking \nSensors 2010, 10                            \n \n \n1836\nwith a bandwidth of 25 kHz and a dynamic range of approximately 50 g (g = 9.80665 m\/s2). The \nfeedback signal was recorded to measure the frequency excursions of the FBG and thus the acceleration. \nFigure 16. The acceleration noise spectral density along one axis of the accelerometer.

The system reaches a sensitivity noise floor ranging between 10  \nand 900 \u00b5g\/\u221aHz, in the 10\u20131000 Hz interval, with similar performance along different orthogonal \ndirections. As expected, at low frequencies the acceleration sensitivity is reduced by the characteristic \nnoise roll-up when approaching DC, due to seismic noise and laser-frequency noise [27]. Indeed, jitter \nand drifts in laser\u2019s emission frequency represent the main constraint to the minimum detectable \ndeformation [28]. The detection limit can be improved either employing a different laser or decreasing \nits free-running frequency noise by pre-stabilization onto an external cavity (e.g., a fiber ring resonator). \n \n4. Application of Fiber Optic Sensing to Recordings of Musical Instruments \n \nAs was shown above, single FBGs, and especially cavities made of two identical FBGs, can be \nfashioned into very sensitive sensors for strain and vibration. One recently developed application lies \nin the monitoring of the sound generated by a musical instrument [29]. All \u201cacoustic\u201d string \ninstruments, such as guitars, violins, and even cembalos or harps, have a soundboard that amplifies the \nsound generated by the string movement. The exact shape of the soundboard determines the coloration \nof the instrument through, e.g., the presence of harmonic excitations and vibrational nodes. Most \nserious musicians prefer to record the sound of their instrument using a high quality microphone, but \nthis may be impractical in an environment with large background \u201cnoise\u201d such as a performance stage. \nMany acoustic guitars and, to a much lesser extent, other string instruments are therefore equipped \nwith piezoelectric transducers (PZT \u201cpick-ups\u201d) that are placed on the soundboard and convert its \nSensors 2010, 10                            \n \n \n1837\nvibrations into an electrical signal. While pick-ups have a fairly flat frequency response between about \n100 Hz\u201320 kHz and are inexpensive, they also have comparably high inertia, and are difficult to \namplify due to their high impedance. When many of these PZTs are mounted onto a single instrument, \nthe vibrations of the soundboard maybe affected and the instrument coloration may be altered.  \nFiber optic transducers are preferred when size and inertial mass is a concern. In the following \nsections, two sensors are briefly described, one based on the acoustic modulation of the reflectivity of \na single FBG near its mid-reflection point and another one based on the reflectance near a cavity fringe \nof a cavity made of two identical FBGs. \n4.1. Single FBG Transducer \nIn a preliminary study we have demonstrated the feasibility of acoustic transduction by affixing a \nsingle FBG on a guitar body and comparing the recordings with those made by a PZT [29]. A DFB \nlaser (AC 5900, Archcom Technologies) was set to a wavelength near the mid-reflection point of a \ncommercial FBG (reflection bandwidth: 0.2 nm; peak attenuation 30 dB) and the transmitted light was \nmonitored by a fast InGaAs photodiode (DET10C, Thorlabs). Recordings were made at a sampling \nrate of 44.1 kHz when individual strings were plucked. The Fourier transform of these traces showed \nvery similar frequency response for both the PZT and the FBG transducers as expected. Differences \ncould be readily attributed to the difference in positions at which the sensors are placed on the \nsoundboard, i.e., under the bridge (PZT) and about half distance between bridge and guitar rim (FBG). \nGraphical representations are not very informative regarding the sensors\u2019 performance and we refer to \nthe electronic material associated with reference [29] for audio recordings. \nFigure 17.

FBG Cavity Transducer \nMore recently we used a Fabry-Perot cavity made of two identical FBGs that were placed 10 mm \napart to obtain sound recordings at higher sensitivity and lower noise. The FBG cavity (QPS \nPhotronics, Montreal, QC) was deliberately made to have a very low finesse (F < 5) as is clearly \napparent from the inset of the cavity reflection spectrum (Figure 17). A DFB laser (QPS Photronics) \nwas current (temperature) tunable and was periodically reset to a wavelength near the mid-reflection \npoint of a cavity fringe. Light from the laser was directed to the FBG cavity which was fixed onto the \nsoundboard of the guitar with adhesive tape. The reflected light was directed by a fiber optic circulator \ninto a photodetector. The photodiode signal was amplified and sampled using an audio preamplifier \n(Edirol UA-25EX). Figure 18 shows the first 250 ms of a 10 s time evolution of the transmitted light \nsignal and the PZT response as the guitar\u2019s E4 string is plucked. The Fourier transforms of the entire \nPZT and FBG transducer recordings show the fundamental frequency of the E4 note (here slightly \nmistuned to 326.8 Hz) as well as its harmonics up to the 25th overtone at 8,171 Hz. Both transducers \ncould reproduce frequencies higher up to 22 kHz with the FBG transducer exhibiting a lower noise \nfloor. The difference in their frequency response is partly due to the different position on the guitar body. \nRecordings with other musical instruments were made and, of those, the solid body electric guitar \nand solid body electric bass guitar were particularly promising. Recordings made with a violin and a \ndifferent louder acoustic guitar showed evidence of clipping of the higher vibrational modes. \nInstruments in which the sound is generated by a resonating air column (woodwinds, brass \ninstruments) also showed a response, but the sensitivity to high frequencies was poor.  \nFuture work will focus on improving further the sound quality by using a Pound-Drever-Hall \nfeedback scheme similar to that described in section 3 [7]. \nFigure 18.

Chemical Sensing by Optical-Fiber Ring Resonators \nChemical sensors using fiber-optic methodology are the subject of extensive research and \ndevelopment activity with potential applications in industrial, environmental and biomedical \nmonitoring [30-32]. In this context, a miniature chemical sensor combining laser spectroscopy and \nstate-of-the-art optical fiber technology may be suitable to in-situ, non-invasive gas and liquid analysis \nwith high selectivity and sensitivity. This can be based on either direct or indirect (indicator-based) \ndetection techniques [33,34]. In the former scheme, the optical properties of the analyte, such as \nrefractive index (RI), absorption or emission, are measured directly. In the indirect scheme, the color \nor fluorescence of an immobilized label compound, or any other optically-detectable bioprocess, are \nmonitored. In recent years, interrogation techniques have further advanced with the use of  \nspatially-resolved spectroscopy [35], evanescent-wave spectroscopy [36-38] as well as surface-plasmon \nresonance [39-42]. Sensors have also been incorporated into passive optical cavities consisting of fiber \nloops or linear fiber cavities defined e.g., by two identical FBGs [43-45]. These cavities have shown to \nbe effective means of amplifying the sensors response. Their application to mechanical sensing is \nreviewed elsewhere in this issue. Optical microresonators, of different geometries, have been also used \nas label-free and ultrasensitive chemical sensors over the past several years [46-49]. In all cases above, \na change in ambient refractive index may lead to a wavelength shift of the cavity modes, if part of the \nevanescent wave of the mode is exposed to the environment. On the other hand, if the molecules \nexhibit absorption lines or bands in the vicinity of the resonance wavelength, the cavity lifetime, \nnamely the ring-down time (RDT), will be reduced, leading also to a reduction in power transmitted \nthrough the resonator and in the quality (Q-) factor. \nIn our research, a passive optical-fiber ring (OFR) resonator has been developed for chemical \nanalysis of liquids. As is well known, a light leakage from the fiber changes the resonator finesse. In \nour experiment, along a short region of the fiber within the loop, the core is exposed to a liquid sample \ncontaining the species of interest. The presence of this analyte can be measured, for example, by \nmonitoring the light loss due to optical absorption or the refractive index changes through  \nevanescent-wave interaction. Preliminary results on operation and test are presented. \nThe reflected and transmitted intensities from the cavity can be expressed from the multiple \ninterference of superimposed signals circulating in the fiber ring. The round-trip phase-lag \u03d5 in such a \ncavity is given by \uf028 \uf029\uf06c\n\uf070\uf06a ln4\uf03d , where n is the refractive index of the medium (i.e., fiber core), l is the \nhalf-length of the loop, and \u03bb is the propagating wavelength, while the finesse can be defined as \nk-1\nk\n F\n\uf070\uf03d  with k the coupling coefficient of radiation to the cavity [50]. The observed peak\u2019s full width \nat half maximum (FWHM) can be characterized by \nF\nFSR \uf03d\uf064\uf06e , where FSR is the free spectral range. \nThe height and width of the peaks change due to additional loss by the chemicals in the sensitive part \nof the fiber [36].  \nThe experimental set-up used to interrogate the fiber resonator and extract the absorption \ninformation is shown in Figure 19. The OFR was built using SMF-28 fiber (length is about 2.5 m) and \na variable-ratio fiber coupler (1\u201599%) to inject near-infrared radiation into the cavity. A fiber \nevanescent-field access block (EAB) allowed the (evanescent) cavity-field to interact with the external \nSensors 2010, 10                            \n \n \n1840\nenvironment. We use an extended-cavity diode laser emitting in the telecom region of the  \nspectrum (1,560 \u00b1 30 nm) as a coherent-light source. It was frequency modulated at about 2 MHz \nthrough its bias-tee input, so that symmetrical sidebands are superimposed on the carrier frequency. \nThe laser, equipped with a single-mode polarization-maintaining (PM) fiber pig-tail, was directly \nconnected to one port of a single-mode coupler via a fiber polarization controller (PC) in order to \ndefine the state of polarization and select a specific cavity eigenmode. The fiber coupler also collected \nthe radiation that partially leaked out from the loop. The transmission peaks observed on cavity \nresonances over a laser-frequency sweep are shown in Figure 20.  \nThe EAB had an effective length of \u2248 1 mm and was devised to have a 2.6% residual  \ntransmission ( k  = 0.974) with overlay of matching index (1.467). The sensing element of the fiber was \nplaced on a glass substrate on which chemicals could be readily applied. The overall coupling \ncoefficient, which is determined by the variable coupler only if the external refractive index is  \nbelow 1.467, affects the overall finesse, theoretically ranging from 3 to 300. A piezo-electric \ntransducer was glued on the fiber for modulation of the loop length (stretching range 10 \uf06dm in  \nthe 0\u20131 kHz frequency range) when scanning of the loop\u2019s resonances was necessary. The \ninterrogation principle relies on heterodyne detection of the output signal from the OFR when the \nsource is tuned into resonance with it. In particular, the signal coming from the loop was detected by \nan InGaAs PIN photodiode (Thorlabs DET01CFC) and amplified by a 500 MHz amplifier \n(MiniCircuit ZFL-500LN). Demodulation at 2 MHz was performed by a double-balanced mixer, \ngenerating an error signal for laser locking to the resonance according to the Pound-Drever-Hall \ntechnique (see section 2.2). The PDH signal was sent to a proportional-integrative circuit (servo) that \nprovided the necessary feedback to the laser. In this way, the laser could be frequency-stabilized to a \ncavity mode for several hours, without suffering from thermal fluctuations of the environment. \nLocking action is shown in Figure 20. \nOur first test of the sensor\u2019s response consisted of covering the EAB with a solution containing \nglycerol diluted by 5% D2O, which does not absorb strongly around 1,560 nm (compared to H2O). In \nthis way, the external index increased nearly to the critical value and the light intensity dropped \ndramatically in typically few seconds. The cavity response (transmission and error signal) was stored \nbefore and after applying the sample. The EAB could be cleaned by ethanol to restore the initial \ncondition. When the sample was applied to the EAB, the cavity resonances (Figure 21, left) remained \nsymmetric while the width of the signal was increased as expected from finesse degradation. Hence a \nfraction of the guided core mode leaked out from the cavity due to the high-index glycerol cladding. \nThe same has been obtained when the laser was locked to the cavity mode (Figure 21, right), and the \ncontinuous transmission trace showed a sudden signal reduction with application of the  \nsample (bottom-right), with a further slower decrease due to the evaporation of water with time. This \neffect was particularly evident because the external index was much closer to the maximal value \npermissible for light confinement. Nevertheless, the laser remained always locked to the cavity. As the \nexperiment is repeated with increasing concentration of heavy water (10%, 20%, 30%, 50% in \nglycerol) the refractive index decreases and with it the cavity loss. \nA particular liquid species, with a strong absorption band around the laser wavelength, can thus be \ndiluted in a glycerol-water \u201cindex-matching\u201d solution and the absorption-induced loss on the \ntransmission detected as a function of wavelength and concentration, similarly to direct absorption \nSensors 2010, 10                            \n \n \n1841\nspectroscopy. At present, work is in progress to identify and quantify different species in a sample \nmeasuring the cavity ring-down time (RDT) that carries the information on the absorbance. The RDT \nwill be extracted by resonant coupling of an intensity-modulated light beam into the cavity and \nmeasuring the modulation frequency-dependent phase-shift of light exiting the resonator by a lock-in \namplifier. This approach is referred to as the phase-shift cavity ring-down (PS-CRD) and can be \napplied to fast and sensitive retrieval of the chemically-induced resonator losses [9,36]. An improved \nversion comprising a widely-tunable laser and an EAB with longer exposed length is underway. \nFigure 19. Schematic of the fiber-ring resonator.

Conclusions \nWe have developed several experimental systems devoted to interrogation of optical fiber sensors, \nwhich are strongly based on the extension of laser-spectroscopic methods to analyze their reflected \nradiation. They demonstrated a great potential in terms of sensitivity and precision for different fields, \nsuch as geophysical survey, structural health monitoring, accelerometers and chemical sensing. For \nmost sensors, active frequency locking of lasers to the sensors revealed to be very effective for  \nreal-time, low-noise monitoring. Particularly, the use of optical fiber resonators provided a superior \nsensitivity level in measurements of deformation and temperature without adding significant \ncomplexity. This is the case of FBG resonators for 10-12 static and dynamic strain detection. On the \nother hand, the use of highly-birefringent fibers represents a possible solution to thermal  \ncross-sensitivity. Some relevant applications are also shown, including wide-bandwidth accelerometers \nand acoustic instrument tools. Finally, a preliminary evidence of evanescent-wave sensing in liquids \nby an optical fiber-ring resonator is provided. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors acknowledge financial support by CNR RSTL project, PON (Italian Ministry of \nEducation, University and Research) and contribution by R.
