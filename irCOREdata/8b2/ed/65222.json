This article introduces the problem of having to risk one\u2019s life for the state in war,\nasking first why this question is no longer asked in the just war literature and then\nsuggesting five issues that relate to this question: 1) that of individual consent, 2) whether\nor not any state can be justified in obliging its citizens in this regard and whether or not\nthe type of government is important, 3) whether or not the problem of the obligation differs\nbetween conscript and volunteer armies, 4) the problem of political obligation and how any\nindividual could be justifiably obliged to risk his or her life for the state in war, and 5) the\nquestion of whether a citizen may be obliged to go into any war. The argument is that these\nquestions are no longer given much attention in the just war literature because of the way\nthat the concept of proper authority has come to be understood. The article concludes\nby suggesting that the problem of the \u2018obligation to die\u2019 should be included in our\nunderstanding and use of just war theory and the ethics of war.\nIntroduction\nOn 16 December 2008, Frank Gaffney, the former Assistant Defense Secretary of\nthe US, speaking about the war in Iraq and defending the decision to go war and\nsend over four thousand American soldiers to their deaths, said on national\ntelevision, \u2018It is regrettable that they had to die, but I believe they did have to die\n[. . .] The danger was inaction could have resulted in the death of a great many\nmore Americans, more than 4000. And that\u2019s the reason I\u2019m still delighted that we\ndid what we did [. . .]\u20191 Gaffney seems to believe that these soldiers had an\nobligation to die \u2013 \u2018they did have to die\u2019 \u2013 but was this obligation just? He tries\nto justify their deaths by claiming that they had to die for the greater good, that\na few deaths of American soldiers is preferable to even more deaths of American\ncitizens. These are highly questionable claims, particularly in light of the war he is\ndefending. Indeed, how is one to explain the justifiability of these deaths when\nthere is so much doubt over the actual reasons for the war, the costs of the war\nand its justifiability? If the war was unjustified, was the state justified in sending so\nmany soldiers to their deaths? What if the war was justified? Does it matter that\nthose who died were voluntary enlistees and not conscripted soldiers? What about\nthose who enlisted, and their access to making an informed choice about the need\nfor this war and thus of signing up for dangerous duty? While the death toll of\nAmerican soldiers in Iraq has led to significant moral outrage in the US, it is\n1 MSNBC Hardball with Chris Mathews, 16 December 2008.\nReview of International Studies (2010), 36, 215\u2013234 Copyright \u0002 British International Studies Association\ndoi:10.1017\/S026021050999057X\n215\nunclear how to incorporate this moral discourse into our understanding of the\nethics of war or of the justifiability of this particular war. During the Vietnam War,\nthe combination of an unpopular war and a national draft encouraged political\ntheorists to evaluate the problem of being sent into war. In this climate, Michael\nWalzer wrote the seminal article on the subject, \u2018The Obligation to Die\u2019.2 Since\nthen there has been remarkably little analysis of the moral (and political) issues\nthat involve either the ability of the state to justifiably oblige its citizens to risk\ntheir lives on its behalf, or the justifiability of risking one\u2019s life for the state or its\nequivalent by being sent into war.3 The silence in the ethics of war literature on\nthis subject is all the more surprising as the United States has found itself in\nanother unpopular war, this time joined by the UK, in Iraq and many Nato\ncountries are fighting another war in Afghanistan. It is all the more intriguing that\nthe justifiability of this obligation has not been addressed considering the lengths\nto which the Bush Administration has tried to hide from view the coffins and\nfunerals of American soldiers who died in Iraq.4 Clearly the Bush Administration\nrealised the potential moral fallout they could suffer by allowing the public to see\nthe death toll of the war, a lesson they may have learned from the Vietnam War.\nTo be clear, at issue is not a general obligation to military service but an\nobligation to do so in war and be faced with risking one\u2019s life in the process. Indeed,\nit was on this point that Peter Paret calls for analysis of the obligation that Walzer\ncalled, with rhetorical flourish, the obligation to die.5 The obligation to die is not\nreally an obligation to die but an obligation to be sent into harms way in war. In\nthis regard, Walzer notes that there is a difference between \u2018risking one\u2019s life in war\n[and] losing it [. . .]\u20196 The difference is one of risk, but since Walzer is concerned with\nthe moral problem of actually losing one\u2019s life in war the issue of risk is irrelevant\nto his argument. Yet, the risk factor may suggest that the problem is not really\nabout obligation but of risk. However, while calculating the morality of dying\naccording to risk analysis could mitigate the morality of being sent into harm\u2019s way,\nit does not by itself provide a justification for being in that situation in the first\nplace. As it is used here, the term the obligation to die is shorthand and refers to a\nlimited scope of political obligations related to what Samuel Pufendorf described as\nbeing obliged by the sovereign to be exposed to the danger of death in war.7\n2 Michael Walzer, Obligations: Essays on Disobedience, War and Citizenship (Cambridge, MA:\nHarvard University Press, 1970).\n3 This article raises questions that I address in greater length in, Ilan Zvi Baron, Justifying the\nObligation to Die: War Ethics, and Political Obligation with Illustrations from Zionism (Lanham, MD:\nLexington Books, 2009).\n4 See for example the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s legal request for access to such information,\nnoting that the Defense Department was, \u2018Banning photographers on US military bases from\ncovering the arrival of caskets containing the remains of US soldiers killed overseas\u2019, ACLU Releases\nNavy Files On Civilian Casualties In Iraq War (7\/2\/2008), {http:\/\/www.aclu.org\/natsec\/foia\/\n35878prs20080702.html} accessed on 17 October 2008).

Michael Silverthorne\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 158. He uses the term \u2018compel\u2019 instead of\nobliged.\n216 Ilan Zvi Baron\nRegardless of the slippage that his term suggests between obligations relating to the\nrisk of death, to death itself and to going to war, Walzer\u2019s term offers a rhetorical\npower that is worth keeping and reflects the ultimate seriousness of the issue.\nMoreover, this rhetorical force highlights the absence of this problem from the\ncontemporary literature on the ethics of war and on just war theory. This literature\nrecognises that since war is a human activity it should be subject to moral\nconsiderations. These considerations are distinguished by the two categories of ius\nad bellum (the justice or laws of war) and ius in bello (the justice or laws in war).\nFalling within these two categories we find the general tenets of the just war\ntradition: Under what conditions may another human kill another human and not\nbe guilty of murder? Why, if at all, would killing in war be justifiable? Under what\nconditions may a state be justified in declaring war on another state? What are the\nrules or norms for fighting a war? According to the tradition, a war is just if the\ncriteria of \u2018just cause, right intention, proper authority, last resort, effectiveness,\nproportionality, [and] discrimination\u2019 are met.8\nThe theory thus outlines the application of morality to war, and the\ncontemporary literature generally uses the just war tradition to form sets of\nguidelines for the moral evaluation of a particular conflict or a particular type of\nconflict; sometimes the literature critiques one or more of these guidelines or\nexplains the contribution to the tradition of certain thinkers.9 What is, however,\nabsent in the way that ius in bello and ius ad bellum are being used is the question\nof having to risk one\u2019s life in war. Even the most recent books that address either\njust war thinking10 or the ethics of war11 pay scant attention to the morality of\nhaving to die for the state in war and Gaffney\u2019s misguided attempt at proportion-\nality confuses proportionality into a kind of ius in bello body count,12 whereas the\nproblem of the obligation to risk one\u2019s life in war is primarily related to ius ad\nbellum.\nFor every person that dies on the battlefield, there are at least two fundamental\nmoral issues at stake. The first is that of the individual who kills, and the other is\nthat of the individual who is killed. For every person killed a person dies. This\nblatant truism is perhaps so obvious that most contemporary texts on the ethics of\nwar do not even mention it. In some ways it is slightly absurd that this statement\nneeds to be made. Yet, the absence of literature on this issue is staggering\nconsidering how much is written on the ethics of war. Why is there so little\ncontemporary work on this subject, and what questions are not being asked? I\nargue that the answer to the first question has to do with the acceptance of war\nin the international system and of the way that the proper authority tenet in just\nwar theory has come to be read as a justification of the state\u2019s authority to wage\nwar. If the state has the proper (legitimate may be a better word) authority in this\nregard, then surely it follows that it has to be able to justifiably oblige at minimum\ncertain segments of its population into war. If, however, this authority is not taken\n8 Chris Brown, Sovereignty, Rights and Justice: International Political Theory Today (Oxford; Malden,\nMA: Blackwell Publishers, 2002), p. 104.\n9 For examples of these different ways of using just war theory see, Jean Bethke Elshtain, (ed.), Just\nWar Theory (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1992).\n10 Alex J. Bellamy, Just Wars: From Cicero to Iraq (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2006).\n11 Christopher Coker, Ethics and War in the 21st Century (London: Routledge, 2008).\n12 Proportionality is more complex then this. See, Thomas Hurka, \u2018Proportionality in the Morality of\nWar\u2019, Philosophy and Public Affairs, 33:1 (2005).\nDying for the state 217\nfor granted, then a cascade of deeply moral, political and philosophical questions\nfollow over the nature or type of the obliging authority, the justifiability of the war,\nthe type of army (volunteer or conscript), and, perhaps most complex of all, the\nproblem of political obligation itself.13 In an article it is not possible to address all\nof these topics in the depth that they deserve, but there is also no text that provides\nan account of what questions are not being asked in this regard, why they are not\nbeing asked and why they should be asked.\nConsequently, I argue how the problem of the obligation to die has come to be\ntaken for granted in the literature while also demonstrating that it has not always\nbeen this way, thereby providing a philosophical and ethical exploration of the\nobligation to be sent into war and face the danger of death. Subsequently, I\nintroduce and survey the ethical questions that we need to be asking in order to\nbring this deep political theory about obligation and death into applied ethical\npractice. I suggest that we take this obligation for granted because of the way that\nthe tenet of proper authority has come to be understood. Consequently, this article\nprovides a re-familiarisation of the claims that lie behind the proper authority tenet\nin classical just war thought, focusing on how this tenet relates to identity, theories\nof state and political obligation. Moreover, the approach taken here begins with\nproblems of political philosophy and then moves into the applied ethical issues\npertinent to war. As such, I suggest that it is important to understand the\nphilosophical background to how ethical arguments are made and recognised to be\nsomehow appropriate to contemporary conditions. In providing this normative\nre-engagement with some of the core assumptions contained in the ethics of war\nand just war theory, I address future research questions that ethics of war thinkers\nshould be addressing.\nThings aren\u2019t always obvious\nFor Aristotle it was a given that part of being a citizen involved going to war and\npossibly dying in the process. Socrates makes the connection quite clear between\nbeing a good citizen and risking one\u2019s life for the state in war.14 Interestingly, what\nAristotle does say is that it is glorious to die in battle, since to die in war is to\nbecome a hero, and heroes are remembered and it is better to be remembered\nthan forgotten.15 This warrior ethos, recognising the glory of death in battle,\n13 Some notable texts on political obligation are, James S.

Urmson and David Ross\n(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998).\n218 Ilan Zvi Baron\ncharacteristic in Homer\u2019s Iliad, was the explanation behind why anybody would\neven consider dying in war. They died as citizens, but in dying they became heroes.\nDying in war was an obvious possibility for the citizen, but Aristotle still felt some\nneed to explain why anybody would want to die in war even though he does not\nseem to find it necessary to explain how the obligation is justifiable. The obligation\nsimply exists by definition of being a citizen: a theory of obligation is not\nnecessary.16\nHowever, for St. Augustine, one of the founders of what became known as the\njust war tradition, the obligation was not so obvious. In fact, Augustine, and then\nThomas Aquinas among other Christian just war thinkers, was greatly concerned\nwith this problem, since it had to be explained how the sovereign could without\nprejudice to his soul send subjects to their possible death in war, and how those\nsent could risk their lives knowing that in doing so and in being sent to kill others\nat the same time, they would not be risking their souls either. The problem of being\nsent to risk one\u2019s life in war was, for Aristotle a problem relevant primarily to the\npolitics of heroism, but for Augustine it was a serious problem of political\nobligation. Indeed, many of the classical just war theorists and numerous political\nphilosophers took this obligation quite seriously, and did so in part by elaborating\non the concept of proper authority, although in significantly different ways.\nAugustine\u2019s account of the proper authority in relation to war is rooted in his\noverarching concern about individual salvation. He recognises war to be a\nhorrifying event, even if the waging of war brings about peace.17 Augustine argues\nthat our lives must be lived in order to achieve salvation, and that obedience is\nimportant in this regard, even when war is concerned, and this is how he argues\nthat anyone ordered into war by the proper authority must go. Augustine writes:\nBut when a lawful soldier, obedient to the power under which he has been lawfully placed,\nslays a man, he is not guilty of murder according to the laws of his city. On the contrary, if\nhe does not do so, he is guilty of desertion and contempt of authority. If he had done this\nof his own free will and authority, however, he would have fallen into the crime of\nshedding human blood.18\nIn this passage Augustine does many things. He implies that it is necessary to have\nthe proper authority (that is, \u2018the power\u2019, which I take in this context to mean the\nsame as authority) in order to wage war, because otherwise the war and the killing\nit involves would be wrong if not criminal. In addition, he states that nobody can\ngo to war as an individual. This argument is traditionally assumed to mean that\nonly states can fight a war, but in an Augustinian context, it also means that\nindividuals do not have the moral ability to decide when one should fight.\nAugustine also emphasises that following the orders of the proper authority is an\nimperative. To disobey orders is just as much of a crime as if the soldier were to\nkill without orders. Consequently, Augustine makes no allowance for political\n16 Which is not to say that conscription in ancient Athens was unproblematic. See, Matthew R. Christ,\n\u2018Conscription of Hoplites in Classical Athens\u2019, The Classical Quarterly, New Series, 51:2 (2001). The\nproblem of justifying an obligation to die is also taken up by Socrates in and immediately after his\ntrial. See, Plato, The Last Days of Socrates: Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Phaedo, trans. Hugh\nTredennick and Harold Tarrant (London: Penguin Books, 2003).\n17 Augustine, The City of God against the Pagans, R.W. Dyson (ed.), trans. R.W. Dyson (Cambridge;\nNew York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 934, (Book XIX 12).\n18 Augustine, The City of God, p. 39, (Book I 26).\nDying for the state 219\ndisobedience. Rebellion or civil war is not allowed for at least three reasons, which\nfurther contextualise why the proper authorities are to be obeyed. First, because\nindividuals have no individual rights, there can be no individual right to rebel\nagainst any established order. Second, all humans are guilty (of sin) so it makes\nsense to follow those in authority and not try to replace them with others who are\nat best equally guilty. Just as there is no individual right to disobey or rebel there\nis no collective right. Third, life in the city of man is made possible by the plans\nof God, albeit plans concocted after the fall from grace (and the establishment of\nhuman guilt).19 Consequently, individual subjects are to obey, or rather, are\nobliged to obey their proper authorities and thus to act according to the order\nestablished by God and to contribute to the possibility of achieving individual\nsalvation by having a pure soul. Augustine is claiming that the death of the body\nis not as great of a concern as is the maintenance of one\u2019s soul.\nAugustine\u2019s account of the proper authority is also about clarifying the roles of\nthe religious authorities and secular ones while maintaining that even in the secular\nrealm of material concerns it is the overarching belief in the soul and of eternal\nsalvation that guides the normative conditions of life on earth. St. Augustine\u2019s\npolitical-theology was so influential that when centuries later St. Thomas Aquinas\nargued against Augustine\u2019s deeply negative account of human politics, Aquinas\nnevertheless and somewhat paradoxically claimed to be in general agreement with\nthis master. One of the more important differences between the two is with their\nrespective understanding of the conditions in what Augustine calls the \u2018City of\nMan\u2019. Unlike Augustine, who perceives the need for human socio-political\norganisation to be a product of sin, Aquinas sees the city as a positive element\ncorresponding to the laws of nature. He writes,\nIt is natural for man to live in fellowship with many others, it is necessary for there to be\nsome means whereby such a community of men may be ruled. For if many men were to\nlive together with each providing only what is convenient for himself, the community would\nbreak up into its various parts unless one of them had responsibility for the good of the\ncommunity as a whole, just as the body of a man and of any other animal would fall apart\nif there were not some general ruling force to sustain the body and secure the common\ngood of all its parts.20\nIn its simplest form, Aquinas claims that the state exists because people need to live\nin a state in order to survive. He adopts, in another difference from Augustine\u2019s\nPlatonism, Aristotle\u2019s teleological understanding of the human condition arguing\nthat, \u2018Man is by nature a social and political animal, who lives in a community.\u201921\n19 For more on the political thought of St. Augustine see, Herbert A.

Dyson (ed.), trans. R. W. Dyson (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2005), p. 7 (De Regimine Principum).\n21 Aquinas, Political Writings, pp. 5\u20136 (De Regimine Principum). There is some debate as to the\naccuracy of Aquinas\u2019 translation of Aristotle\u2019s famous description of man as a political animal (a\nz\u00f5on politikon). Dyson argues that Aquinas\u2019 translation (which Aquinas takes from a Latin\ntranslation of Aristotle, but is apparently already used by Seneca) is more accurate in its inclusion\n220 Ilan Zvi Baron\nConsequently, as this reference to nature attests to, Aquinas argues that\nobligations to obey the proper authorities are natural, and in a slight twist on\nAugustine\u2019s account, writes that, \u2018Therefore as man must obey God in all things,\nso too must he obey his superiors.\u201922 With such a direct link between obeying God\nand obeying one\u2019s superiors, Aquinas\u2019 account is also clearly related to religious\nsalvation. In this regard, A. P. D\u2019Entr\u00e8ves says that, \u2018It is enough to remember the\nmain principle which St. Thomas develops, that, as the duty of obedience to\nauthority is grounded both upon divine and natural order, its limits are necessarily\nfixed by the correspondence of human authority with divine and natural law, that\nis, with justice.\u201923 The purpose of human laws may be to \u2018lead men to virtue\u2019,24 but\nnot all virtues can be led to by human law, and in any case, the reason for living\na life of virtue is to live a life according to the will of God. This is why Aquinas\ncan argue that a good king can take the sons of his subjects and send them to their\npossible death in war.25\nWhat both Augustine and Aquinas demonstrate is, as D\u2019Entr\u00e8ves points out in\nrelation to Aquinas but is true of Augustine as well,26 that the problem of being\nobliged to obey human authority was a great concern in medieval political thought,\na concern that remained constant throughout the history of political thought. The\ndebates have changed, with individual rights and consent eventually supplanting\nthe role of salvation and \u2018natural\u2019 obedience, but while their concern with the issue\nof being obliged into war played a significant part in their just war thinking, this\nfocus has been somewhat lost. I say somewhat because while contemporary just\nwar texts do not address this problem, related arguments over the problem of being\nobliged into war can be found in many notable philosophical works outside of the\njust war tradition. Spinoza, Rousseau, Kant, Hobbes and Hegel all mention this\nobligation in various ways and recognise the challenges that it poses to the\nnormative conditions of life in the state. Consequently, how has it been that this\nobligation has become taken for granted?\nOne possible answer has to do with the false disciplinary boundaries that have\nexisted between Political Theory and International Relations since the problem of\nbeing sent by the state to risk one\u2019s life is technically an issue of political\nobligation. Famously pointed out by Martin Wight, political theorists have by and\nlarge not been interested in questions of international relations.27 Wight was\nwrong, but the argument is certainly consistent with the way that academia tends\nto distinguish between political theorists and international relations scholars,\nalthough this divide is becoming increasingly challenged. A more plausible answer\ncould be with the way that the modern state has come to be identified.\nof the word social than the \u2018literal\u2019 translation that uses only the adjective political to describe \u2018man\u2019.\nHannah Arendt, however, argues that the Latin translation is erroneous in that the \u2018word \u201csocial\u201d\nis Roman in origin and has no equivalent in Greek language or thought.\u2019 Hannah Arendt, The\nHuman Condition (London and Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1958), p. 23.\n22 Aquinas, Political Writings, p. 67.\n23 Alessandro Passerin d\u2019Entr\u00e8ves, The Medieval Contribution to Political Thought: Thomas Aquinas,\nMarsilius of Padua, Richard Hooker (New York: Humanities Press, 1959), p. 34.\n24 Aquinas, Political Writings, p. 141 (Summa Theologiae IaIIae 96).\n25 Aquinas, Political Writings. p. 56 (Summa Theologiae IaIIae 105:1).\n26 Passerin d\u2019Entr\u00e8ves, The Medieval Contribution to Political Thought.\n27 Martin Wight, \u2018Why Is There No International Theory\u2019, International Relations, 21:1 (1960).\nDying for the state 221\nIn just war terminology, both Augustine and Aquinas frame the problem of the\nobligation to risk one\u2019s life in war as one of proper authority. The obligation is\njustified when it comes from the proper or legitimate authority. Consequently, one\nreason why this issue is no longer addressed may be with how the understanding\nof \u2018proper authority\u2019 in the ethics of war literature has changed. In this regard, one\nmajor change in our thinking has been the acceptance of Weber\u2019s argument that\nthe state owns the monopoly on the legitimate use of force.28 Subsequently, it has\nbecome a conventional wisdom that the state is the only legitimate actor who may\nresort to international armed force. While classical just war theorists often found\nit necessary to address the complexity of proper authority, this tenet has become\nalmost shorthand for the state. It is not an error to presume that just war theory\nsupports this claim that only states have the legitimacy to resort to armed force,\nbut it is a simplification with consequences, one of which is that we no longer ask\nsuch \u2018questions of state\u2019 that illuminate the conditions and questions that\ncharacterise modern international political life. Consequently, it has become\nacceptable to provide little explanation of the obligation to go into war, since war\nis a fundamental aspect of the modern state and as such is a definitional\ncomponent of state sovereignty over the citizenry. If the state has the legitimate\nauthority to use force then it must also be able to justifiably obligate those into\nusing force and as a consequence, when sent into war, of risking their lives.\nAnother possible answer, and which follows from this way of reading the\nproper authority tenet, is with the way that war has become increasingly treated\nin international law, and in particular with the project of trying to outlaw war. The\ninternational lawyer Yoram Dinstein notes that contemporary international legal\nliterature does not engage with ius ad bellum. Ius ad bellum, along with its\nphilosophical and theological referents, are not the kinds of issues that inter-\nnational lawyers engage with anymore.29 According to Dinstein, one of the reasons\nfor this absence within the international legal community has to do with how the\nissues behind the legality of war are of a philosophical, moral and possibly\ntheological character. International law has, so it seems, solved the ius ad bellum\nproblem by trying to outlaw war and claiming that any legal resort to violence has\nto be of a defensive nature. A war, consequently, can become justified provided\nthat it is a response to an illegal act of aggression. Just war theorists thus have an\nexcuse not to critique the ius ad bellum components. The philosopher Robert\nHolmes notes that, \u2018Most modern theorists [. . .] devote little attention to the\nquestion of whether a war is justified; they assume that it is and ask only under\nwhat conditions it is justified and how it is to be conducted justly.\u201930 To a certain\ndegree this assumption is not surprising, although post September 11th 2001, this\nassumption is becoming increasingly challenged (especially when debating the war\nin Iraq).31 Such challenges notwithstanding, if war is rendered illegal by inter-\n28 Max Weber, \u2018The Profession and Vocation of Politics\u2019, in Max Weber, Peter Lassman, and Ronald\nSpeirs (eds), Political Writings (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), pp. 310\u20131.\n29 Yoram Dinstein, War, Aggression and Self-Defence, 3rd edn (Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress, 2001), p. 63.\n30 Robert L. Holmes, On War and Morality (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1989), p. 163.\n31 Although post 9\/11 and especially in regard to the war in Iraq the debate has broadened over the\njustifiable causes for war. See, James Turner Johnson, The War to Oust Saddam Hussein: Just War\nand the New Face of Conflict (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2005); Lee Feinstein\nand Anne-Marie Slaughter, \u2018A Duty to Prevent\u2019, Foreign Affairs, 83:1 (2004); Neta C. Crawford,\n222 Ilan Zvi Baron\nnational law, then what matters is not the question of resorting to force or the\nproblem of proper authority, but how responses to illegal resorts to force can be\nkept within the moral codes that led to the outlaw of war in the first place.\nAccording to Dinstein, \u2018In the nineteenth and (and early part of the twentieth)\ncentury, the attempt to differentiate between just and unjust wars in positive\ninternational law was discredited and abandoned.\u201932 W. E. Hall gives two reasons\nbehind this abandonment in his famous Treatise on International Law. First,\ndisputes or causes leading to war are usually not based in \u2018any fundamental\nprinciple of law\u2019,33 and are consequently, \u2018too complex to be judged with any\ncertainty [. . .].\u201934 The rules which jurists have made in regard to a just cause have\nbeen, \u2018mere abstract statements of principles, or perhaps of truisms, which it is\nunnecessary to reproduce.\u201935 Hall then references Ayala, Grotius, Vattel,36 and a\nfew others as sources of such truisms and vague statements of principle. Hall\u2019s\nsecond reason is that even if it were possible to determine which side in war was\nright and which side was wrong, it would still be futile to attempt to punish the\naggressor since no enforcement mechanism exists. \u2018The obedience which is paid to\nlaw must be a willing obedience, and when a state has taken up arms unjustly it\nis useless to expect it to acquiesce in the imposition of penalties for its act.\u201937\nFirst published in 1880, Hall\u2019s Treatise argues that any notion of just cause is\nnot only legally useless, but also pointless. Even if it were possible to determine\nwhich side in war has the just cause, doing so does nothing to limit the possibilities\nfor war. Moreover, because of the legal identity of states as parties of equal rights,\nit follows that any state has the legal right to wage war thus removing any legal\nneed for a just cause. Hall writes,\nInternational law has consequently no alternative but to accept war, independent of its\norigin, as a relation which the parties to it may set up if they choose, and to busy itself\nonly in regulating the effects of the relation. Hence, both parties to every war are regarded\nas being in an identical legal position, and consequently as being possessed of equal\nrights.38\nIn the 19th Century opinion was, as exemplified by Hall, that ius ad bellum issues\nwere not a problem due to the practices of states, viewed as equal agents, which\nmade such concerns irrelevant. After WWI, however, this opinion changed, as\n\u2018The Slippery Slope to Preventive War\u2019, Ethics and International Affairs, 17:1 (2003); Whitley\nKaufman, \u2018What\u2019s Wrong with Preventive War?

This shift is demon-\nstrated by the international community\u2019s attempts to punish Germany and demand\nthat Germany accept all culpability for the First World War.39 This shift continued\nwith the development of positive law about legal and illegal wars, the Kellogg\/\nBriand pact of 1928, and the UN Charter of 1945.40\nModern international law has tried to outlaw war (with varying degrees of\nsuccess). International law started to formally limit the legality of war with Article\n2 of the Hague Convention (I) of 1899 as well as that of 1907. The convention\ncalled for states to resort to arms only after non-violent means had been attempted.\nIn 1919 the Covenant of the League of Nations attempted to further limit the\npossibilities of war by giving the League some powers to prevent war from\nbreaking out. In 1928, the Kellogg\/Briand Pact declared war illegal in principle.41\nIn 1945, the Charter of the United Nations continued this process of trying to\noutlaw war. Article 2 (Chapter 1) of the Charter states that, \u2018All members shall\nrefrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the\nterritorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner\ninconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\u201942 Chapter VII provides the\nlegal options under which a war can be waged, which other than a war of self-\ndefence, requires a resolution of the Security Council (in which case one wonder\nwhether the term \u2018war\u2019 is accurate).\nThe legal theorist Hans Kelsen illustrates this shift in international legal\nthinking by using the concept of aggression to identify the illegality of a war. He\nwrites,\nThe rules of international law by which \u2018war\u2019 is forbidden, and accordingly, a \u2018delict\u2019, refer\nonly to the action of one state, not to the counteraction of the other. This is usually\nexpressed by the statement that only a war of aggression, that is, the war on the part of the\nstate which is the first to commit a hostile act of force, is forbidden, not the war waged by\nthe state defending itself against the aggressor.43\nHedley Bull provides another example of this kind of theorising about war when\nhe identifies a Grotian approach that seeks to distinguish when a war is sanctioned\nby international society and when it is not.44\nThe attempt to outlaw war has effectively altered how war is thought of.\nMichael Walzer\u2019s method in Just and Unjust Wars is to start with an account of\n39 Hans Kelsen, in Robert W. Tucker (ed.), Principles of International Law, 2nd edn (New York;\nLondon: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1966).\n40 See chapter XXX in, Josef L. Kunz, The Changing Law of Nations: Essays on International Law\n(Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1968).\n41 Although Carl Schmitt argues that the Kellogg\/Briand Pact actually sanctifies war. See, Carl Schmitt,\nThe Concept of the Political (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), p. 50 fn. 21. Alternatively,\nHans Kelsen does not claim that the Kellogg\/Briand pact sanctions war; rather he argues that the\npact differentiates between types of war.

See also pages 29\u201339 for his discussion of just war\ndoctrine.\n44 Bull\u2019s \u2018Grotian conception of international society\u2019 is presented in opposition to Oppenheim\u2019s\napproach that takes war to be a prerogative of the state and claims that international law is\nconcerned with the conduct of war and not the legality of going to war. See, Hedley Bull, \u2018The\nGrotian Conception of International Society\u2019, in Herbet Butterfield and Martin Wight (eds),\nDiplomatic Investigations: Essays in the Theory of International Politics (London: George Allen &\nUnwin Ltd., 1966).\n224 Ilan Zvi Baron\naggression as the only real crime that exists between states. With a legal war\nrequiring another to break the law with an act of aggression, to a significant degree\nius ad bellum has in a sense been replaced by ius contra bellum (justice against\nwar).45 International law is, of course, not so straightforward. A war or a similar\nresort to force could be legal under other sections of the Charter, or may be\njustified solely by reference to the purposes of the Charter. However, while\napproaches to the justifiability and legality of war have changed, the presumption\non the authority of the state to wage war has not. The claim in the 19th Century\nthat war is a presumed prerogative of the state effectively meant that ius ad bellum\nissues were not a problem. In the 20th Century, this presumption was no longer\naccepted and positive international law became concerned with the legality or\nillegality of war. However, in both the 19th and 20th Centuries, as well as in the\n21st Century, there was no debate about what it is about the state that makes it\nthe authority that may justifiably, either because of convention or because of\npositive law, go to war.\nNevertheless, such questions are important, as the early just war theorists knew.\nThey point out that in order to provide an ethical argument about applying\nmorality to war we need to think philosophically about the political conditions that\ngive such ethical arguments the sound of plausibility and applicability. The\nproblem of the obligation to die is, however, not solely about political obligation,\nbut also about a variety of related and equally moral and political considerations\nthat the ethics of war literature takes for granted. Consequently, it is time to recall\na lesson of the classical just war theorists and take a critical look at what moral,\npolitical and philosophical questions arise in relation to the problem of being\nobliged into battle by the state. There are at least five explicitly relevant questions\nto the moral problem of being obligated to be exposed to the danger of death in\nwar:\n1. That of individual consent;\n2. Whether or not any state can be justified in obliging its citizens in this regard\nand whether or not the type of government is important;\n3. Whether or not the problem of the obligation differs between conscript and\nvolunteer armies;\n4. How any individual could be presumed to have a moral obligation to obey the\nlaw to be sent into war and not resist this politico-legal obligation;\n5. Whether a citizen may be obliged to go into any war.\nThese questions overlap and there are sub-questions and combination ques-\ntions, including how membership involves an obligation that goes against the\nnatural right to self-preservation, what makes the state an entity able to obligate\nits citizens to risk their lives on its behalf, how ideology serves as a justifying force\nfor people who risk their lives in war, and does it matter who is obliged? There are\nsurely other relevant considerations, but for now I am limiting myself to these five,\n45 Josef Kunz describes this shift as being from bellum justum to bellum legale. Kunz argues that the\nLeague of Nations Covenant replaced the justifiability and unjustifiability of war with formal legal\nrules about the legality or illegality of war. Thus a legal war could be fought by a state that had\nno just cause but had the formal approval of the League. The Kellog\/Briand Pact furthered this\ndistinction by declaring war to be, in principle, an illegal means to pursue foreign policy. See, Kunz,\nThe Changing Law of Nations, p. 580.\nDying for the state 225\nthereby making it possible to demonstrate how these questions are linked, what\nbroader questions they raise, and why it is important to address the philosophical\nissues that contextualise our ethical thinking about the morality of obligation,\ndeath and war.\n1. Consenting to risk one\u2019s life\nIn his account of sending individuals to war, Kant raises a paradigmatic problem.\nConsidering that in a state of international anarchy states may wage war against\neach other, and that the sovereign has the prerogative to do so when in the state\u2019s\nbest interest, by what moral justification could the sovereign send his subjects to\nwar? Kant, the moral philosopher who says that humans must be treated as ends\nand not means states in The Metaphysics of Morals that,\nIf we consider the original right of free states in the state of nature to make war upon one\nanother (for example, in order to bring about a condition closer to that governed by right),\nwe must first ask what right the state has as against its own subjects to employ them in a\nwar on other states, and to expend or hazard their possessions or even their lives in the\nprocess. Does it not then depend upon their own judgement whether they wish to go to war\nor not? May they simply be sent thither at the sovereign\u2019s supreme command?46\nKant claims that the individual must be given the chance to consent to this\nobligation, although there is some trouble as to how this consent is presumed to\ntake place since Kant also says that the subjects must obey the sovereign. Thus,\nKant implies that to think about the obligation to die is to think about the\nconditions under which legitimate resistance to authority may take place.\nThere is much more that can be said here, but what should not escape notice\nis that Thomas Hobbes provides a surprisingly similar argument. According to the\nbasic argument contained in Leviathan that postulates that people trade certain\nliberties for security, if the sovereign were to ask its citizens to risk their lives by\ngoing to war then two problems immediately arise. First, the citizen could refuse\nthe demand and claim that it makes no sense to go to war for the sake of a\ncontract that is supposed to avoid war. Second, the citizen would have a legitimate\nright to rebel against the sovereign who has clearly been unable to guarantee the\nterms of the contract in which the sovereign is supposed to protect the lives of its\nsubjects or citizens. The obligation to die would be a concrete example of a failed\ncontract. However, Hobbes in chapter 21 of Leviathan recognises that this\nobligation is crucial for sovereignty. He claims that the inhabitants are obliged to\nrisk their lives if the commonwealth is threatened. If the community is at risk of\nbeing dissolved by a foreign threat and for the sake of the good provided by the\ncommonwealth an obligation to risk dying emerges. Presumably, wars of aggres-\nsion would not justify such an obligation, although this conclusion does not apply\nsince Hobbes asserts that the sovereign may go to war if the sovereign deems it\nnecessary for the security and prosperity of the commonwealth.47\n46 Immanuel Kant, Kant: Political Writings, ed. Hans Reiss, trans. H. B. Nisbet, 2nd edn (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 1991), p. 166. (emphasis in original).\n47 Thomas Hobbes, in Richard Tuck (ed.), Leviathan, Rev. student ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1996), p. 126 (ch. 18).\n226 Ilan Zvi Baron\nThe problem that Hobbes and the consent tradition has to resolve is why the\ncontract makes an allowance for people to violate that basic and inviolable natural\nright of self-preservation.48 Indeed, contra chapter 21, Hobbes could easily be\nassumed to say that under no conditions can the obligation to die be justified\nbecause nobody can give up their right to life without thereby entering the state of\nnature, and if the sovereign places them in this position they have no reason to\nobey. Empirically, however, we know that the state has been extremely successful,\nparticularly in the 20th Century, in sending its citizens into war. Not only have\nvarious dictatorships, autocracies, monarchies and other non-democratic states\nbeen successful, but so have democracies. If consent is an important moral\ncategory in the construction of a just state, would a war be just if those sent into\nwar are not given the chance to consent to going into war?49 Consequently, from\na moral standpoint it may be that one of the just war tenets should take into\naccount the type of government that sends its citizens into war, or if not the type\nof government, the type of state.\n2. The type of state\nDoes it matter whether or not any state can be justified in sending its inhabitants\nto risk their lives in war? The problem of any authority sending its subjects into\nwar was one of the considerations that animated the just war thinkers who sought\nto restrict who could be justified in declaring war. This restriction is approached\nin the just war literature under the tenet of proper authority, with the argument\nbeing that only a proper authority may declare war, and, subsequently, only the\nproper authority can obligate members of the community to risk their lives in war.\nI suggested above that the proper authority tenet contributed to contemporary\nethics of war literature ignoring the problem of the obligation to die. In\ncontemporary just war literature this tenet serves to legitimise states as the only\nactors who could wage war and legitimises states with specific powers in relation\nto other states. The proper authority tenet came to be seen not as a foundation for\njustifying the authority of the state in relation to its inhabitants, but in relation to\nother states. By linking together the state with the ability to legitimately declare\nwar, \u2018proper authority\u2019 establishes a community of agents with similar abilities in\nrelation to each other, thus restricting who may enter into the community of\nnations, who may wage war, conduct relevant treaty negotiations and so on.\nConsequently, while it was important for early just war theorists such as St.\nAugustine and St. Thomas Aquinas to justify the authority in relation to its\ndomestic constituents, this feature became overshadowed by a process of reading\nthis tenet as a feature explaining an international system. This shift became\nincreasingly pronounced in modern international law.\n48 Hobbes, Leviathan, pp. 93, 141, and 51. (Chapters 14, 20, and 21). In chapter 14 he claims that is\npreferable to be a slave than to die, and in chapter 21 he claims that the sovereign may not ask a\nsubject to kill himself or another individual.\n49 Paul Stern has addressed the role of nationalism in over-riding motives of self-preservation in going\nto risk one\u2019s life in war. Paul C. Stern, \u2018Why Do People Sacrifice for Their Nations?\u2019, Political\nPsychology, 16:2 (1995).\nDying for the state 227\nThis reading of the proper authority tenet, however, leaves unanswered whether\nor not any authority is justified in going to war and thus sending its inhabitants\ninto battle? Medieval just war works also include treatments on the issue of\nrebellion and resistance to the proper authority. Both Augustine and Aquinas\nheavily circumscribe any possibility for legitimate disobedience to authority, but\nthe important point is that they addressed it as part of their exploration of political\nobligation to the proper authority. For example, Augustine\u2019s claim that since we\nall live in a world of sin it would be futile to overthrow one imperfect ruler with\nanother indicates a concern with the character of the authority doing the obliging.\nAugustine further addresses this issue in regard to different types of authority. For\nexample, he claims that a priest should not take charge over material issues of rule,\nalthough a priest could certainly counsel or guide a temporal ruler.50 The\noutstanding question, however, which needs to be addressed, is whether or not any\nstate has this proper authority. Some of the just war thinkers did in fact address\nthis issue, such as Vitoria who asks whether or not the American Indians could be\nconsidered to have dominion over their land, and thus be justified in resisting the\ntheft of their property.51\nThis issue has also been addressed, albeit indirectly, in some modern liberal\nthought on the problem of political obligation. A notable example of this turn is\nwith the idea of \u2018hypothetical consent\u2019. In a seminal two-part article on the\nproblem of political obligation, Hannah Pitkin makes the case for what she terms,\n\u2018hypothetical consent\u2019. The idea is to focus on the nature of government and\nwhether or not the government ought to be obeyed. \u2018For a legitimate government,\na true authority, one whose subjects are obliged to obey it, emerges as being one\nto which they ought to consent.\u201952 Pitkin\u2019s account of \u2018hypothetical consent\u2019 is\nshorthand for defining the problem of political obligation as being obligated to\nconsent and not consenting to be obligated, provided that the government is just.\n\u2018It is not so much your consent not even the consent of a majority that obligates\nyou. You do not consent to be obligated, but rather are obligated to consent, if\nthe government is just.\u201953\nTaking this approach to the problem of the obligation to die the issue becomes\nwhether or not any state can be just in obligating its citizens into war by virtue of\nwhether or not the state or the government ought to be obeyed. It is in this regard\nthat Barry Buzan suggests that in thinking about bombing populations as part of\na humanitarian intervention, a decisive factor should be whether the population\ndeserves their government.54 The question remains, however, as to what kind of\nstate can justifiably oblige its citizens into war. This question in turn leads to the\nthorny issue of disobedience and rebellion, since if the state goes to war and the\ncitizenry refuse to fight the state has got a serious problem on its hands as its\n50 Augustine, in E.

At minimum the government would collapse. Nevertheless, it\nwould be reasonable to suggest that there is more to this aspect of the obligation\nto die than to repackage it as one of rebellion or disobedience. In short, may any\nstate justifiably obligate its citizens to risk their lives by being sent into war, why,\nand how come such states would be justified in doing so? It seems reasonable to\nsuggest that to be just in this regard the state must respect the rights of its citizens,\nsince it makes no sense to obligate people to risk their lives for the sake of a state\nthat persecutes them. However, this in turn raises further questions about rights,\nas well as what forms of political structures best respect human freedoms or human\nvalues. This issue is complicated, but it is important and is worth further study in\nthinking about the ethics of war. For now, however, these questions about consent\nand about the type of state and type of government suggest another concern, that\nof how the state manages to populate its armed forces.\n3. Conscripts or volunteers\nIs the consent problem solved by whether or not those sent into war sign up\nvoluntarily? Consent theory needs to explain how the rights of the individual are\nrespected within the obligation to take part in war. This problem suggests\ncategorising different types of soldiers: voluntary conscripts who sign up because\nthe army provides a job, individuals who sign up for ideological reasons, or people\nwho are drafted. Whether the force is voluntary or not suggests alternative models\nof the political obligation problem, and not specifically of the obligation to die.\nHowever, at issue here is not the issue of national service, but of such service in\nregard to war and the ethics of war and in this regard it is sensible to inquire into\nhow those who are sent into battle come to find themselves in the armed forces.\nServing in the army, air force, navy or other branch of the armed forces cannot\nbe divorced from the possibility of also facing what Walzer called the obligation\nto die. Insofar as a volunteer force is concerned, volunteers would presumably have\naccepted at least the possibility of the obligation to die. However, in countries that\ninstitute a national draft, under what aegis does the obligation to serve and risk\none\u2019s life become justifiable? Conventional approaches to this question would\npresumably turn on some account of consent theory, be it one framed on the type\nof government as in Pitkin\u2019s argument of \u2018hypothetical consent\u2019 already mentioned\nor some other logic of consent, of which there are many.55\nHowever, whichever logic of consent is taken, the important point is that it\ndoes not matter how the army is populated since the state will presume the ability\nto send any kind of soldier into war. Being a volunteer does not necessarily excuse\nthe state for demanding (even in a voluntary way) its citizens to risk their lives. The\nmoral issue here is that the state can always oblige, if not enforce, its citizens to\ngo to war regardless of the type of war or the type of conscript.56 This point is\nmade by Tim O\u2019Brien in his account of the Vietnam War. O\u2019Brien notes that the\n55 Some of these are surveyed in, George Klosko, Political Obligations (Oxford: Oxford University\nPress, 2005).\n56 The state\u2019s ability to enforce this obligation is, according to Cheyney Ryan, one of the defining\ncharacteristics of the obligation to die in war, as opposed to other situations where one might be\nDying for the state 229\nstate has always been able to send its youth into war and even those who do not\nwant to go submit to the state, if only because they are afraid of incurring\n\u2018society\u2019s censure\u2019.57 For either conscripts or volunteers, there is no room for\nevaluating and then acting on the extent to which they agree with the war they are\nfighting. As O\u2019Brien discovered first-hand, it does not matter if the war is just \u2013\nthey will still be sent into harm\u2019s way. Conscripts can be held accountable for\nrefusing to relinquish their right to life, even in a just war, as in the extreme case\nof Private Eddie Slovik, who on General Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s orders, was\nexecuted for desertion in the Second World War.58 Dubiously, and as Peter Paret\nnotes, those who face the death of battle are rarely those who have declared war\nand yet these decision makers will take it for granted that they can send conscript\nor recruit soldiers to face the danger of death in war.59\nNevertheless, there may be an additional justifying factor in the case where\nthose who go to war are volunteers. However, this factor would need to be\nmitigated by two additional concerns: that of the necessity of the war and of the\nabsolute need to win the war (that is, in cases where Walzer\u2019s supreme emergency\nclause would be relevant),60 and of the conditions under which people enlist. The\nsecond issue seems more serious since it challenges the assumption that the\nobligation to die would be justified in a volunteer army because those who sign up\nfreely chose to do so. What if this free choice is not really free? What about those\nwho sign up because otherwise they cannot afford university, or because it is a way\nto stay out of jail or a way to secure food, clothing and shelter? The volunteer\narmy argument might work if there is a level playing field among those who have\nthe option to volunteer.\nThis has become a particularly politicised issue in the US.61 In a 2002 op-ed in\nThe New York Times the Democratic Congressman from New York, Charles B.\nRangel wrote, \u2018A disproportionate number of the poor and members of minority\ngroups make up the enlisted ranks of the military, while the most privileged\nAmericans are underrepresented or absent.\u201962 This perspective about the American\nArmed Forces is repeated in a November 2005 article in The Washington Post that\nclaimed that Army recruits were primarily poor and from rural areas.63 The article\nimplied that the Army effectively provided these individuals with a job, shelter and\nsomething to do. Another New York Times article claims that minorities feature\nheavily in the US Armed Forces,64 unlike the British Military where in the UK\nobliged to risk one\u2019s life. See, Cheyney C. Ryan, \u2018Self-Defense and the Obligations to Kill and to\nDie\u2019, Ethics and International Affairs, 18:1 (2004); Ryan, \u2018The State and War Making\u2019.\n57 Tim O\u2019Brien, If I Die in a Combat Zone (London, New York, Toronto and Sydney: Harper\nPerennial, 2006), p. 45.\n58 Cheyney Ryan, \u2018The State and War Making\u2019, in John T.

According to the US Army\u2019s 2004 Demographic\nReport, from 1990\u20132004, approximately half of all Active Duty Officers have a\nBachelor\u2019s Degree (47.2 per cent-54 per cent), although this is not the case with the\nActive Duty Enlisted. In 1990 94.8 per cent of Active Duty Enlisted men and\nwomen had less than a Bachelor\u2019s Degree, although only 1.8 per cent had no High\nSchool Diploma. These figures remain relatively constant from 1990 until 2004. In\n2004, 0.8 per cent had no High School Diploma and 93.7 per cent had less than\na Bachelor\u2019s Degree. The Army Enlistees are generally with little post-secondary\neducation. In the same period (1990\u20132004) 18.3 per cent of Active Duty members\nare Black or African American, 64.0 per cent are White; in 2000, the US Census\nshowed that 12.3 per cent of the American population is Black or African\nAmerican and 75.1 per cent are White.68 In relation to other minorities, it is clear\nthat they are proportionally over-represented in the US Military. Ultimately, there\nis doubt as to how much choice possible enlistees in the US Army face in their life\nprospects were they not to join the Army. In other words, it is possible that the\nvoluntary force in the US is not so voluntary as it may appear. Many people may\nsign up because they have little other choices available to them and because, as the\nChristian Science Monitor reported in 2005, the Army offers the best economic\nopportunity.69\nThere has been work done on some of the moral issues involved in a volunteer\narmy as opposed to national conscription,70 and of the problem of the political\nobligation of military service.71 One question suggested by this literature is the\nextent to which a state can ignore the difference between a conscript and a\nvolunteer force, and send either type of soldier into battle. Indeed, if we are to\nhave a better grasp of the ethics of war and the justifiability of the obligation\nto die, surely it is important to think about the demographics of those sent into\nwar.\n65 Alan Cowell, \u2018Ideas and Trends: Class Wars; Britain\u2019s Upper Crust Still Soldiers On\u2019, The New York\nTimes (7 September 2003).\n66 Tim Kane, \u2018Who Bears the Burden?

A moral\naccount of military service is addressed in Walzer, Obligations.\n71 Klosko, Political Obligations.\nDying for the state 231\n4. The political obligation problem\nThe vast amount of literature that seeks to clarify and\/or explain the problem of\npolitical obligation tends not to ask the question in relation to the obligation to\ndie. One notable exception here is Michael Walzer\u2019s essay, in which he addresses\nthe problem of being sent into war as a problem of political obligation. He ends\nhis essay on the obligation to die by claiming that,\nAll this comes dangerously near to suggesting that a man is obligated to die only if he feels\nor thinks himself obligated. That seems to be the consequence of arguing first, with\nRousseau, that there are moral goods for which a man might well be bound to die, and\narguing, secondly, against Rousseau, that it is never possible to say that a particular man is\nbound to die for a particular moral good (unless he has said so himself).72\nTo claim that the obligation to die exists only if it is presumed to exist by each\ncitizen is true in a sense, since at issue are social constructions. Moreover, there is\nsomething comforting about presuming that this obligation exists in the minds of\nthe citizens and not in the abilities of the sovereign or the remote halls of\ngovernment. However, this conclusion is not especially helpful or illuminating. It\nis ironic that this is one of Walzer\u2019s conclusions considering that he wrote this\nessay in response to the Vietnam War, which involved a draft for a war that many\ndid not support. Yet, so long as Walzer\u2019s conclusion is of this kind, then the draft\nin this war would be just, which would seem to run counter to the intent of\nWalzer\u2019s examinations on war and ethics. Furthermore, the lottery draft at this\ntime surely lends some empirical doubt as to how far consent counts when the state\ndecides to go to war. To be fair, Walzer\u2019s essay, The Obligation to Die, is\nexceptional in scope and detail, and the strengths of the essay are in his\nobservations about some of the classical arguments that have served to justify this\nobligation. As an argument serving to explain how the obligation could be just,\nhowever, the essay is lacking for Walzer does not explain how the obligation to die\ncan be justified. His final statement on the obligation is to claim that people will\nchoose to accept the obligation to die because it is a part of choosing to live like\na citizen.\nOne of Walzer\u2019s additional conclusions in the essay is that feeling obliged and\nbeing obliged are different, and that being obliged is in a sense contingent on being\na good citizen, bound to the common life of the community. Hegel, Rousseau, and\nSocrates heavily influence this argument. Indeed, the death of Socrates is an\nimportant example of the obligation to die. Yet, what does it mean to be a good\ncitizen? Does being a good citizen mean that one has to be prepared to die for the\nstate? If so, why? How does being a good citizen explain why the sovereign may\njustifiably oblige its subjects (in this case, citizens) in this manner? Why does being\na good citizen mean that the sovereign can be presumed to have the power to\noblige in this way? Walzer is either curiously silent or overly brief in regard to these\nquestions insofar as they serve to justify the obligation to die. His justification of\nthe liberal egalitarian state could provide some headway into what is necessary for\nthe obligation to be just, although this line of inquiry would lead to a debate about\nwhat sort of state could justifiably oblige, which is a different question from what\nis it about the state that gives it the ability to justifiably send its citizens to their\n72 Walzer, Obligations, p. 98.\n232 Ilan Zvi Baron\npossible death in war and, subsequently, how this obligation is justified. If one were\nto take the consent argument at face value and presume that consent does take\nplace, what would happen in a state where consent does not take place, or if people\ndo not consent and are forced to go into war anyway? In this case, the obligation\ncould not be morally justifiable, but in general remarkably little would be affected\nsince the obligation would still stand and most citizens would still be sent or go\ninto war, as was the case in the Vietnam War. In short, what Walzer does is repeat\nthe Kantian dichotomy between individual morality demanding that those sent to\nwar are given the choice and the reality that the state may compel its citizens into\nwar if government decides to.73\n5. War\nCan the obligation be just in any war? This question suggests that there is a\nconnection between the ius in bello and ius ad bellum requirements and the\njustifiability of the obligation to die. In normative terms there should be some\nrelation, since it seems questionable to be just in risking one\u2019s life for an unjust\nwar, although the classical just war theorists would claim that it would be just since\nthe issue is one of obeying the authorities in order to have a pure soul. It was in\nregard to this problem that Vitoria provides his example of invincible ignorance,\nby which he means that one\u2019s soul is safe even if one commits an act of sin,\nprovided that this person did everything possible to learn the truth, but since one\ncannot know everything it is often sufficient for one\u2019s soul to obey the proper\nauthorities and thus act according to the law.74 Aside from this issue, which gets\nus back to the problem of resistance (and it may be that the strongest argument\nfor justifying the obligation to die would be to ask whether or not the obligation\nshould be resisted), there is the additional problem of how the just war tenets\nwould be used in justifying the obligation to die. Just war is not a shopping list,\nand so the application of just war tenets to the obligation to die would have to\nmatch the way that the tradition is used, assuming that one is comfortable with the\ntradition and its usage. There is such a vast amount of scholarship on this regard\nthat repetition here is both unnecessary and would inevitably be grossly insuffi-\ncient. It is worth noting, however, that George Kateb suggests that one condition\nfor the obligation to be just is for the obligation to arise in relation to a war of\nself-defence.75 Nevertheless, it may be worth thinking about the way that just war\ntheory is used, and how the ethics of and in war could contribute to justifying the\nobligation to die.\n73 It is both noteworthy and curious that in his review of Just and Unjust Wars, Hedley Bull\ncommented that Walzer\u2019s research on the just war needed and suggested further work on the topic\nof political obligation. It is noteworthy because Bull rightly spotted an important and unaddressed\nside to the ethics of war, but it is curious because Walzer had already written his essay on the\nobligation to die. See, Hedley Bull, \u2018Recapturing the Just War for Political Theory\u2019, World Politics,\n31:4 (1979).\n74 Vitoria, Political Writings.\n75 George Kateb, The Inner Ocean: Individualism and Democratic Culture (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell\nUniversity Press, 1992), p. 183.\nDying for the state 233\nConclusion\nThe problem posed by the obligation to die can be summed up with the following\nexample. In the 18th Century, the English jurist William Blackstone wrote that, \u2018In\nfree states [. . .] no man should take up arms, but with a view to defend his country\nand its laws; he puts not off the citizen when he enters the camp; but it is because\nhe is a citizen, and would wish to continue to do so, that he makes himself for a\nwhile a soldier.\u201976 However, Blackstone\u2019s optimism was not met with reality, for in\nEngland (and elsewhere) in the late 18th Century there was widespread public\nopposition and resistance, including riots, to serving in the military.77\nBy the 20th Century the situation had changed and there was no such problem\nin conscripting soldiers, as demonstrated by two World Wars. Due partly to this\nunparalleled ability to conscript citizens into fighting and dying for the state, but\nalso from changes in international law that did not question the authority of the\nstate, attempts in the 20th Century to justify the obligation to die diminished\nsignificantly. The state had, so it seemed, managed to consolidate its authority and\ncould conscript with legal, moral and political impunity. Nevertheless, the problem\nof the obligation to die briefly resurfaced in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. As\nin Blackstone\u2019s day, the contrast in opinion and reality resurfaced, albeit with a\nmodification, for it was no longer obvious that the citizen would wish to make\nhimself or herself a soldier even while the state could count on the majority of\ncitizens being obliged into military service. In either example, the obligation to die\nis a problem.\nThis article is one attempt to broaden our understanding of the ethics of war,\nto blur the divide between the political philosophy that lies behind ethics of war\ntheory and its applied ethical side, to suggest some questions that should animate\nfuture research on ethics and war, and possibly revive or open up some of the\ntenets in the just war tradition. In addressing the moral problem of the obligation\nto die, it becomes evident that a full application of just war theory needs to go\nback and take into account the philosophical claims that characterise the tenets of\nthe just war tradition. While many just war texts do this, the contemporary divorce\nbetween the morality of killing and the morality of death nevertheless exists as a\nresult of taking for granted the philosophical assumptions that lie behind the ius\nad bellum tenet of proper authority. While there may be good reasons for the\nhistorical shift of attention away from the problem of proper authority and the\nsubsequent issue of being obligated into war, the problem of being obliged to risk\none\u2019s life for the state by being sent into war is a problem that has and should\ncontinue to influence our understanding and use of the ethics of war and just war\ntheory. This problem should continue to be of interest not only because the\nquestion of dying is the other side of the moral coin about killing in war, but\nbecause it is a serious moral issue in its own right.\n76 Peter Paret, Understanding War: Essays on Clausewitz and the History of Military Power (Princeton,\nN.J.: Princeton University Press, 1992), p. 40.\n77 Paret, Understanding War.\n234 Ilan Zvi Baron\n"}
