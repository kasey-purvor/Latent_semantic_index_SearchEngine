To a large extent this is due to the high workload involved with such activities. We distin-\nguish support related to learning content, learning processes and student products. At two different\neducational institutions, surveys were conducted to identify the most critical support activities,\nusing the Nominal Group Method. The results are discussed and brought to bear on the distinction\nbetween content-related, process-related and product-related support activities.\nIntroduction\nModern higher education curricula increasingly make use of information and\ncommunication technologies, and thus increasingly implement e-learning. This\napplies to open, distance education as well as more traditional forms of education\n(Guri-Rosenbilt, 2005). It is well known that the introduction of e-learning often\nleads to an increase in staff time spent on tutoring (Bartolic-Zlomislic & Bates, 1999;\nde Bie, 2002; Romiszowski & Ravitz, 1997 as cited in Fox & MacKeogh, 2003).\nRumble (2001, pp. 81\u201382) suggests that there is even a doubling of the workload.\nOne of the most important reasons for this is that often an extended classroom model\nis applied (Beaudoin, 1990; Salmon, 2004). That is, in addition to the usual lectures\nand availability during office hours, a teacher creates a web site to support the course\nand is available for email help between classes. Staff who use e-learning environments\nto organise student support this way profit little from economy of scales: students are\ntreated as help seeking individuals, rather than as a group. The problem is further\n*Corresponding author. Educational Technology Expertise Centre, Open University of the\nNetherlands, P.O. Box 2960, NL-6401DL Heerlen. The Netherlands. Email: fred.devries@ou.nl\n220 F. J. de Vries et al.\nexacerbated, as online students\u2014rightly or wrongly\u2014expect to be able to send emails\nto support staff and receive answers quickly (Salmon, 2004).\nIn addition to this the characteristics of the questions for support change. As\nAnderson (2004) points out, tutors in an e-learning context are no longer restricted\nto well-defined and pre-planned tasks but have to adapt on the fly to student needs.\nTutors have to make provisions for negotiation of their activities to meet unique\nlearning needs, and equally well have to stimulate, guide and support the learning in\na way that responds to common and unique student needs.\nA way out of this predicament is to develop technologies that make support activi-\nties significantly less time consuming. This is not as easy as it may sound. Although\nit is not hard to incorporate technology in teaching and learning, this does not neces-\nsarily lead to more efficient practices. Furthermore, it is also important to determine\nfirst whether there is a real user need for software to be developed (Cooper & Saun-\nders, 2000). This kind of approach readily becomes costly, more time-consuming and\nthus ineffective. So the challenge is to select e-learning-based support activities that\nprofit from technology support and to make sure that the perceived need is a genuine\none (Koper, 2004).\nThree categories of support activities in blended learning environments are\ndistinguished: support related to the learning content (CONT), support related to\nthe learning process (PROC) and support related to the learning product (PROD)\n(Reid & Newhouse, 2004). Content-related support refers to all tutor activities that\npertain to the subject matter. Cases in point are answering content-related ques-\ntions, providing additional explanations or examples with regard to the subject\nmatter. As a result of the introduction of e-learning, staff report an increase in the\nflow of content questions and answers from and to students. This is partly due to\nan increase in opportunities to reflect as a consequence of written interaction\ninstead of oral interaction with the result that a content question is discussed on a\ndeeper level. In addition, the existence of an interaction pattern that involves all\nstudents instead of only a few of them also intensifies the tutor\u2013student communi-\ncation. After all, a question posed by the staff to enable students to rehearse the\nsubject matter now reaches each student individually and not only those who pay\nattention (Coppola et al., 2002).\nProcess-related support refers to all tutor activities related to the learning process\nof individual learners or group collaboration. Examples include providing \u2018study aids\u2019\nor moderating group discussions. In blended learning environments, staff now see\nthat their role is changing from instructor to facilitator. Instead of being responsible\nfor student acquisition of knowledge, their responsibility shifts to moderating student\nactivity in, for example, collaborative groups (Coppola et al., 2002). In other words,\ndue to the introduction of e-learning the emphasis of the support activities shifts from\ncontent-related support (i.e. transmission of knowledge) to process-related support\n(i.e. facilitating and guiding students) (Beaudoin, 1990; Hardless & Nulden, 1999).\nAs Denis et al. (2004 ) claim, an e-tutor is \u2018\u2026 someone who interacts directly with\nlearners to support their learning process when they are separated from the tutor in\ntime and place for some or all these direct interactions\u2019.\nIdentification of support activities in e-learning 221\nProduct-related support refers to all tutor activities that pertain to the summative\nassessment of student products; such as checking the authenticity of the product or\ncorrecting tests. Although the emphasis on process-related support in blended learn-\ning environments also results in a greater emphasis on formative assessment (Hard-\nless & Nulden, 1999), the summative assessment of student products remains an\nimportant support activity (Beaudoin, 1990). Plagiarism is particularly problematic\nin e-learning. It appears that the detection rates of plagiarism are only 1.5% and that\napproximately 20% of the tutors ignore obvious plagiarism because of the hassle of\ndealing with it (Bennett, 2005). It would seem, then, that extra effort is necessary to\nput a stop to these practices.\nThree categories of support activities\u2014content-related, process-related and prod-\nuct-related support\u2014have been discussed and illustrated by the changes that tutors\nhave to face when e-learning is introduced in their curriculum. The present study\naims to identify the critical support activities in both distance and e-learning-enriched\neducation that can be supported by technical solutions. With regard to the activities\nidentified, it furthermore investigates whether tutors in distance education identify\nproblems that are different from those identified by their colleagues in traditional\neducation. Finally, it explores whether the categories of support activities differ in\nperceived importance. Here too, the opinions of tutors in distance education are\ncontrasted to those of tutors in traditional education.\nMaterials and methods\nTwo separate brainstorm sessions were organised, each structured according to the\nNominal Group Approach (Dunham, 1998). In the Nominal Group Approach, after\nthe topic has been presented to session participants, they are asked to take a few\nminutes to think about and write down their responses. Once everyone has given a\nresponse, participants are asked for a second or third response, until all of their\nanswers have been noted. Once duplications are eliminated, each response is assigned\na letter or number. Session participants are then asked to choose up to 10 responses\nthat they feel are the most important and rank them according to their relative impor-\ntance. These rankings are collected from all participants and aggregated.\nOne brainstorm session involved a group of stakeholders at an open distance learn-\ning institute (Open University of The Netherlands (OUNL)), the other stakeholders\nwere from a traditional teacher training institution (Fontys University for Professional\nEducation, Fontys, The Netherlands). The latter have been practising forms of\nblended learning for several years. The participant groups at the two institutions did\nnot interact with one another.\nBoth institutions are situated in The Netherlands; but they cater for different\nstudents. The OUNL serves mainly students who study at their own pace and in their\nown time. Some are degree students, but most are lifelong learners who are studying\nto improve their job qualifications or just for pleasure. Students range in age from 18\nup to 80 and older. The OUNL relies on information and communications technol-\nogy tools for its learning management, such as newsgroups and an in-house-built\n222 F. J. de Vries et al.\nvirtual learning environment (VLE). The Fontys teacher training institute teaches\nfull-time (day-time) as well as part-time students. The full-timers outnumber the\npart-timers only by a margin. For both groups, e-learning tools such as e-mail, the\nWeb and a VLE are used intensely.\nThe OUNL group consisted of 12 people, including faculty members, educational\ndesigners and staff from the teacher training institute. They were not randomly drawn\nfrom the OUNL\u2019s faculty, but rather carefully selected for their expertise and experi-\nence, which included course design, tutoring, help-desk support, educational\nresearch and software development. Here three of the participants provided no scores\nat all or invalid scores and were subsequently ignored, bringing the OUNL group\ndown to nine members. The Fontys group consisted of seven people, all working at\nthe teacher training faculty. They were not chosen randomly either, they were\nselected because they fulfilled managerial duties beyond their teaching responsibili-\nties. Not only would the group including all teachers have been too large, it was felt\nthat teachers with managerial duties would have a more informed opinion on the\nmatter. Two of the participants provided invalid scores and were subsequently\nignored, bringing the Fontys group down to five members.\nBy way of preparation, the organisers of the brainstorm invited the participants in\neach group to consider the following questions: \n\u25cf Which support activities currently lead to staff workload problems?\n\u25cf Which support activities do you find relevant but are not common practice because\nof workload constraints?\nAt the subsequent face-to-face sessions (a separate one for each group), the brain-\nstorm organisers (the same people for each group) briefly introduced the nominal\ngroup approach to the participants. Referring to the preparatory questions, every\nparticipant was then asked to draw on his or her personal experiences and describe as\nmany situations as possible of critical student-support activities. They were stimu-\nlated to be creative and take risks; that is, also to take into consideration situations\nthey believed to be critical but had not experienced so far. The participants within a\ngroup were stimulated to interact with each other, if they so wanted. However, they\nwere asked not to criticise any contribution\u2014all ideas were to be considered equally\ngood or bad.\nWith a great many ideas on display, the participants were then asked, as far as\nnecessary, to briefly explain them. After eliminating the apparently synonymous items\n(this was discussed in the group) they were asked to add new ideas, if they felt they\nhad any. At the end, the OUNL group came up with 37 items and the Fontys group\nwith 13.\nFinally, the participants were asked to give votes to the items, as a reflection of an\nitem\u2019s degree of importance. They could attribute either 1, 2, \u2026 9 or 10 votes. More-\nover, each number of votes could be allocated once only. This means that, for each\nindividual participant, 10 items would each receive a unique number of votes and the\nremaining would receive none. It also means that each participant had a total of 55\nvotes to distribute.\nIdentification of support activities in e-learning 223\nThe method followed is in accordance with the Nominal Group Approach. Clearly,\nanother allocation scheme could have been followed; for instance, one in which\nparticipants could freely distribute votes over categories. In principle, they then could\nhave allocated all votes to one item only or, conversely, have distributed their votes\nevenly over all items. We chose the present scheme with limited distribution possibil-\nities as we wanted to force the participants to consider a sizeable number of items\n(10), but not so large a number that they could effectively refrain from choosing. The\nlatter could happen easily, as the participants themselves came up with the various\nitems and might thus be inclined to favour their own items over those of others.\nAn effort was made to categorise the variety of items that resulted from the Nomi-\nnal Group Approach. Four experts, all authors of this paper, allotted each of the 50\nitems to only one of three categories (CONT, PROC, PROD). After the first round\nof allotment, no effort was made to align the opinions of the experts. The language of\nthe items about which the experts were ambiguous clearly was to blame, rather than\nconfusion among the experts about the categories themselves. In order to estimate the\ninter-observer reliability, Cohen\u2019s (1960) kappa value was used. The computation is\nstraightforward for two observers (and several categories) or several observers and\ntwo categories. The present case has four observers and three categories. Following\nFleiss (1981) and Landis and Koch (1977), three separate kappa values were first\ncomputed, one for each of the three categories (case several observers and two cate-\ngories). Effectively, for the computation of each individual kappa value, one of the\nthree categories was set apart and the remaining two categories were grouped. These\nthree kappa values provided insight in the inter-observer reliability per category.\nSubsequently, the overall kappa value was computed as the weighted average of the\nresulting kappa values (again, following Bonnardel). This provides insight in the\ninter-observer reliability for the entire allotment exercise.\nFindings\nTables 1 and 2 present the items that came out of the nominal group session for the\nOUNL and Fontys groups. In both tables, each entry lists an item suggested by one\nor more of the participants. Votes reflect the cumulative votes of all the participants.\nItems are ordered by the number of votes they received. The material and methods\nsection explains how the totals have been computed. Also the total number of votes\neach item received is indicated. This number (\u2018score\u2019) is an indication of how relevant\nthe participants deemed a particular item to be.\nAre all items equally important?\nThe first question to be answered, for each institution separately, is whether the\nparticipants consider some items more important than others. Inspection of the\ntables suggests clear agreement on the side of the participants on what items matter\nand what do not. The possible range for the scores on each item in Table 1 is 0\u201390\nvotes; in Table 2 it is 0\u201350 votes (the maximum score is the maximum score per\n224 F. J. de Vries et al.\nTable 1.

Also, it would be interesting to know whether\nthe institutions differ in what matters to them and what does not. Unfortunately, the\nnominal group method is ill-suited to answer this kind of question. As discussed,\naccording to it, participants themselves formulate items. This has the benefit that one\nmaximally taps into the creativity of the participants. It has the drawback that it is\nimpossible to establish any trend in the participants\u2019 judgements; nor can one make\nintra-group comparisons.\nDo the opinions of participants within and between institutions concur?\nIn order to be able to draw more general conclusions and to compare institutions, first\neach of the items produced by either group of participants was categorised by experts\nas being an instance of either content-related support (CONT), learning process-\nrelated support (PROC) or student product-related support (PROD) (see the final\ncolumn in Tables 1 and 2). This way, a common denominator was established. The\nfour experts received the following instruction when logging their category choices: \n\u25cf Content-related support refers to all those activities support staff undertake that\nare related to the subject matter; for example, answering content-related questions,\nproviding additional explanations or examples with regard to the subject matter,\nand so on.\n\u25cf Process-related support refers to all those activities support staff undertake that are\nrelated to the learning process of individual learners or collaborating groups; for\nexample, providing \u2018study guides\u2019 or moderating group discussions.\n\u25cf Product-related support refers to all those activities support staff undertake that are\nrelated to the formative assessment of student products; for example, checking for\nauthenticity of the product or correcting tests.\nThe subsequent analysis will bear on the categories and the number of items\n(frequencies) that have been allotted to them. The judgements of the experts that\nhave carried out the allotment is a decisive factor. If the experts disagree on the cate-\ngories to which the items belong, further analysis is of little use. Fortunately, the\nweighted mean value of Cohen\u2019s kappa equals 0.61, which according to Fleiss (1981)\nreflects a \u2018good\u2019 degree of inter-observer reliability.\nWith the expert judgements, items were categorised according to the following\nrules: \nIdentification of support activities in e-learning 227\n\u25cf Items that according to three or four of the experts should belong to, say, category\nA were allotted to category A. Items to which this applies are labelled CONT,\nPROC, or PROD in Tables 1 and 2.\n\u25cf Items that less than three of the experts allotted to the same category were ignored.\nSo all permutations of scores (2,2,0) and (2,1,1) were left out. In Tables 1 and 2\nthese items are labelled with one or two asterisks, respectively. These seven items\nare then ignored, leaving a total of 43 items for further analysis.\nTable 3 presents the number of items that ended up in the different categories. A chi-\nsquare test for deviations from a uniform distribution of items over categories, which\none would expect under the null-hypothesis of no prevalence, was not appropriate.\nThe number of categories (three) is too small to convey any power on such a test. The\ntest is further comprised by the low frequencies in two of the cells (1, 2). Similar argu-\nments go for a test of independence, which could show Fontys staff to hold a different\nopinion to OUNL staff. The table nevertheless suggests that both institutions believe\nthat the process category is the most pressing, as it contains by far the most issues.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nThe use of the Nominal Group Method led to a bewildering diversity of critical situ-\nations, identified by staff at both institutions. It did become clear, however, that\ncollectively staff regarded some of the situations as important and others as not\nimportant. Tables 1 and 2 pointed to the particular importance of: \n\u25cf Preventing fraud in papers.\n\u25cf Giving feedback on the progress of students\u2019 work.\n\u25cf Filtering out \u2018repeated\u2019 questions.\n\u25cf Making portfolios of students easily accessible and well structured.\nIt is remarkable that three out of four are process-related support activities, prevent-\ning fraud being the exception (it is a product-related activity). The suggested impor-\ntance of the process category is further reinforced by the observation that the four\nactivities directly below preventing fraud are all process related (see Table 2). Table\n3 further underscores this finding. It shows that at both institutions the overwhelming\nmajority of critical situations belonged to the process category. We may therefore\nconclude that staff consider process-related support activities most critical. As both\ninstitutions surveyed are in transit from traditional forms of distance learning and\nTable 3. Critical situations categorised: absolute frequencies of items for the categories content, \nprocess and product\nCategory OUNL staff Fontys staff Total\nCONT 7 1 8\nPROC 20 8 28\nPROD 5 2 7\n228 F. J. de Vries et al.\nface-to-face learning to their e-learning enhanced pendants, this conclusion is fully in\nline with the early reported literature finding that, upon the introduction of e-learn-\ning, the emphasis shifts from content-related support to process-related support\n(Beaudoin, 1990; Hardless & Nulden, 1999). The high score of the fraud item is also\nin line with literature findings (Bennett, 2005).\nWe need to be cautious of eliminating the apparently unimportant items and cate-\ngories. First, the method followed makes it hard to distinguish between items that are\nfound genuinely unimportant and those that are formulated unattractively. The kind\nof interaction process in which participants of the sessions are engaged leaves little\ntime for reflection and careful consideration. At least this implies that some items will\nattract few votes merely because of their opaque language or because they are not well\nthought through. Clearly, lack of votes does not reflect lack of importance, then, but,\nperhaps, difficulty to exactly pinpoint what the issue amounts to.\nSecond, an argument may be made that process problems are first-order problems\nin that they screen off other problems, particularly content-related problems. A tran-\nsition to e-learning, whether in a distance learning environment or more traditional\nlearning setting, is fraught with difficulties\u2014organisational, technical, pedagogical\n(cf. Sloep et al., in press). Inevitably, students will experience some of these too.\nThese difficulties, irrespective of whether they pertain to content, process or product,\nwill primarily make themselves felt in the learning process. After all, it is while\nlearning that students see themselves confronted with the imperfections of their\nlearning environment. The argument thus is that staff are indeed confronted with\nprocess issues, but that this is at least in part a reflection of the transition process that\ninstitutions are going through.\nIn summary, then, when making the transition from traditional forms of learning\nto e-learning-enhanced, blended forms of learning, it is important to pay particular\nattention to process-related demands for support as well as fraud prevention.\nHowever, content-related and product-related support issues should not be ignored.\nThey might well resurface once the transition nears completion and process issues\nhave been resolved.\nReferences\nAnderson, T.
