Introduction\n[2] The characterization of field line resonance (FLR) in\nthe magnetosphere is an ongoing effort in space physics.\nAlthough the theoretical description of the elementary FLR\nis well established [e.g., Southwood, 1974], the magneto-\nspheric FLR phenomenon is not understood to full satisfac-\ntion. With the launch of new satellites, carrying more\ncomplete instrumentation than previous satellites, and hav-\ning new orbits, thus probing different regions in space, we\ncan increase our understanding of FLR. The Polar satellite\nallows to take a new look at substorm-related FLR.\n[3] Previous studies of FLR can be divided into those\nfocusing on dayside events [Zanetti et al., 1987; Singer et\nal., 1982; Cahill et al., 1986; Lin et al., 1992], on nightside\nevents [Hughes and Grard, 1984; Takahashi et al., 1996;\nKim et al., 2001], those occurring simultaneously with\nsubstorms [e.g., Takahashi et al., 1988; Nose\u00b4 et al., 1998;\nKeiling et al., 2001b], and those triggered by a northward\nturning of IMF [Laakso et al., 1998]. The focus of this study\nwas to determine the electrodynamics of a nightside FLR\nthat was initiated at substorm onset.\n[4] The Polar satellite has a highly elliptical, polar orbit\nwith apogee and perigee of \u00029 RE and \u00021.8 RE, respec-\ntively. During the early years of its operation, Polar\u2019s orbit\ncrossed L shells in the range from 3 to 10 in the Northern\nHemisphere in \u00021 hour, making it suitable to investigate the\nL dependence of FLR which can last for \u000210\u201320 min\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 108, NO. A7, 1275, doi:10.1029\/2002JA009340, 2003\n1Now at Centre d\u2019Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements, Toulouse, France.\nCopyright 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/03\/2002JA009340$09.00\nSMP 4 - 1\n[Takahashi et al., 1996]. We show the L dependence of the\nfrequency of substorm-related FLR during one satellite\ncrossing of a range of L shells. Previous studies of sub-\nstorm-related FLR inferred their L dependence from simul-\ntaneous measurements of a number of satellites that were\nlocated at different local times and different L values\n[Takahashi et al., 1996; Kim et al., 2001].\n[5] In addition, the Polar instrumentation provides the\nopportunity to investigate the electrodynamics of these\nsubstorm-related FLR. Previous studies, investigating L\ndependent FLR in the nightside, either only had magnetic\nfield data available [Kim et al., 2001] or used calculations of\nion moments to infer the electric field [Takahashi et al.,\n1996] to establish their standing wave nature. Measure-\nments of the electric field and magnetic field using the UC\nBerkeley Electric Field Instrument [Harvey et al., 1995] and\nthe UCLA FLuxgate Magnetometer [Russell et al., 1995] on\nPolar directly confirm that the waves are standing. Further-\nmore, we show calculations of Poynting flux in association\nwith these FLR. Using data from the particle detector Hydra\nof the University of Iowa [Scudder et al., 1995] and the\nelectric field instrument, we show that the FLR occurred\noutside the plasmasphere and inside the central plasma sheet\n(CPS). Preliminary results of a statistical study of 24 FLR\nevents also place these events outside the plasmasphere.\n[6] Low and midlatitude ground stations from the Sub-\nAuroral Magnetometer Network (SAMNET) are used to\nconfirm that the satellite observations of FLR were made\nduring a typical substorm. Furthermore, the ground Pi2s\noccurring inside the plasmasphere show a different frequency\ndependence compared to the in situ FLR.\n2. Plasma Sheet Pass on 29 August 1996\n[7] Figure 1 presents the plasma sheet crossing by Polar\non 29 August 1996. The top panel shows the Ex component\nof the electric field. The second panel shows the eastward\nperturbation of the magnetic field By. The field data are\npresented throughout this paper in a field-aligned coordinate\nsystem in which the z axis is parallel to the local magnetic\nfield, B, the x axis is perpendicular to B and points away\nfrom the Earth in the meridional plane, and the y axis is\nperpendicular to B and points in an easterly direction. The\nnext two panels show the plasma density inferred from the\nspacecraft potential [Pedersen, 1995] and the Hydra particle\ndetector. The last panel shows the energy-time spectrogram\nof electrons from Hydra.\n[8] Polar was moving outbound from the plasmasphere\ninto the plasma sheet near the 0330 MLT meridian (along a\ntrajectory east of the SAMNET array, \u00020000 MLT). Polar\ncrossed the plasmapause at about 2315 UT, shortly after\nwhich it entered the central plasma sheet (CPS), identified\nby the energy dispersion in the electron data. Shortly\nthereafter, FLR oscillations were recorded in the electric\nand magnetic fields. These oscillations lasted until 2339 UT\nwhen Polar encountered a large-amplitude electric field\npulse (Ex \u0002 100 mV\/m). This marked the beginning of a\nvariety of physical changes: By increased sharply by\u000260 nT,\nPolar left a region of enhanced electron energy flux and\nentered a region of enhanced ion energy flux (not shown),\nand the tail magnetic field dipolarized as determined from\nthe other two magnetic field components (not shown).\nAlthough these observations are interesting in their own\nright, we will not further discuss them here but focus on\nthe FLR oscillations. The reader is referred to the works\nof Keiling et al. [2001a] and Toivanen et al. [2001] in\nwhich large field fluctuations during substorms are further\ndiscussed.\n[9] Figures 2a and 2b show expanded views of electric and\nmagnetic field components which are perpendicular to each\nother. Both components were band-pass filtered between\n10 and 120 s. The same field-aligned coordinate system is\nused as in Figure 1. Figure 2c shows the Ex component\noverlaid on the Hilbert-transformed magnetic field compo-\nnent, H{By}. Since the Hilbert transform of a signal shifts all\nFourier components by 90\u0002, the fact that both components are\nin phase confirms that these pulsations are standing Alfven\nwaves, i.e., FLR. It can also be seen that the frequency\ndecreased as Polar moved to larger L. We will further\ncomment on this frequency change below. The last panel\nshows the magnetic field-aligned Poynting flux calculated\nfrom the two components shown in this figure. The Poynting\nflux oscillates with varying amplitudes up to 4 mW m\u00012.\n[10] This event occurred during an isolated substorm\nwhich was preceded by about 4 hours of weak geomagnetic\nactivity. Figure 3, which plots the H component of the\nmagnetic field at Oulu (OUL) and By from Polar, shows\na negative deflection in the H component starting at\n\u00022321 UT which we identify as the onset time of the\nsubstorm. Magnetic field oscillations in the Pi2 frequency\nrange began simultaneously both on the ground and at\nPolar. At 2333 UT the substorm electrojet was reduced\nfor a short period of time (seen in the excursion of H), after\nwhich it again intensified at \u00022335 UT. The disturbances at\nOUL also showed strong negative vertical excursions in the\nz component (not presented) indicating that the electrojet\nwas centered to the south of this station. The oscillations at\nPolar lasted longer than those recorded on the ground and\ntheir intensity increased until 2339 UT when By sharply\nincreased, indicating the occurrence of a strong field aligned\ncurrent.\n[11] Figure 4 shows the band-pass filtered (10 s, 100 s) H\ncomponent from all SAMNET stations that had data avail-\nable and the three magnetic field components at Polar. The\ntime interval corresponds to the Pi2 pulsation associated\nwith the substorm expansion phase. Although the ground\nstations were located at different L values (L = 2.57 to 4.48),\nthey all recorded pulsations with approximately the same\nfrequency among themselves. In addition, a phase reversal\noccurred between GML and OUL ground stations. This is a\ntypical substorm ground signature as reported by many\nauthors [e.g., Lester and Orr, 1983; Yeoman and Orr,\n1989]. We also note that OUL showed the largest ampli-\ntudes and a second intensification at \u00022330 UT which was\nnot recorded by the lower L value ground stations.\n[12] The in situ oscillations of the three magnetic field\ncomponents show simularities and differences among them-\nselves. Bz and By started out with similar waveforms and\nfrequencies except for a phase shift of \u000290\u0002. After about\n2324 UT, By decreased in amplitude but continued to show\nclear oscillations which later on increased in amplitude. The\noscillations in Bz also weakened after 2324 UT but only\nshow clear oscillations again after 2330 UT. Although less\nsinusoidal, the Bz oscillations show similar frequencies\nSMP 4 - 2 KEILING ET AL.: ELECTRODYNAMICS OF SUBSTORM-RELATED FLR AND Pi2\ncompared to By after 2333 UT. The magnitude of Bz was\nabout 30% compared with that of By until 2324 UT, after\nwhich it was \u000315%. Whereas By and Bz had the same onset\ntime, clear oscillations in Bx only started about 1 min later.\nThe Bx oscillations were less sinusoidal than By. In the\nfollowing the focus is on By.\n[13] As was shown earlier, By is associated with FLR.

The solid line is the L value crossed\nby Polar. The dots show the frequency of By determined\nfrom counting the time period between two wave crests into\nfrequency. The frequency decreases with increasing L value\nas expected from a simple FLR model of the magneto-\nsphere. The spread of the dots about a best-fit line (not\ndrawn) is partially due to phase skips in the By component\nindicated by arrows in the third panel. If field lines with\ndifferent L value oscillate independently with different\nfrequencies, one might expect complicated phase relation-\nships between neighboring field lines. This phase relation-\nship becomes a function of time and L value. The phase\nskips in By might be indicators of this effect. In spite of the\nerror in the frequency values introduced due to the phase\nskips, there is a clear trend in the data towards lower\nfrequency for larger L values. These satellite observations\nare in agreement with a toroidal resonance of the magneto-\nsphere excited by a broadband frequency source.\n[14] In addition to the single event, we surveyed Polar\norbits of 1997 (nightside only) in a preliminary study,\nresulting in about 490 plasma sheet passes. Polar\u2019s polar\norbit precesses throughout the year, thus covering all\nmagnetic local times with uniform data coverage. Events\nwere visually identified on the basis of oscillation in By\n(azimuthal component) which stood out from the back-\nground. Twenty four events were identified and their\nlocations as a function of magnetic local time versus dipole\nL value is plotted in Figure 5. A concentration of FLR\nevents in the postmidnight sector can be seen. For each\nevent, electric and magnetic fields and plasma density data\nwere investigated. It was found that for all events Ez and By\nwere 90\u0002 out of phase, which indicates their standing wave\nnature. The azimuthal component dominated over the com-\npressional component. Furthermore, the density data shows\nthat all FLR events occurred outside the plasmasphere and\ninside the plasma sheet similar to the 29 August 1996 event.\n3. Summary and Discussion\n[15] The focus of this study was to determine some\nelectrodynamic properties of a nightside FLR (29 August\n1996) in space (\u00020330 MLT, L \u0002 4\u20135.3, 3.6\u20134 RE) which\nwas initiated at substorm onset and to compare the space\nobservations with simultaneous ground Pi2 observations. In\nsitu electric and magnetic field measurements by the Polar\nsatellite confirmed their standing wave nature. Poynting\nflux calculations yielded values up to 4 mW m\u00012. For a\nsingle satellite pass we reported the L dependence of the\nFLR frequency, decreasing from 35 to 15 mHz while the\nsatellite crossed L shells from 4 to 5.3 during a time period\nof 20 min. These observations confirm previous results of\nsubstorm-related, L-dependent FLR derived on the basis of\nmultisatellite studies but show for the first time direct\nmeasurements of the electric fields and associated Poynting\nflux of this type of substorm-related FLR. Takahashi et al.\n[1996] showed that the frequencies of FLR were different at\ndifferent local times and different L shells, using three\nFigure 2.

The data show that\npulsations started simultaneously in space and on the ground.\nSMP 4 - 4 KEILING ET AL.: ELECTRODYNAMICS OF SUBSTORM-RELATED FLR AND Pi2\nsatellites close to the equatorial plane. The FLR reported\nhere was observed at larger magnetic latitude (\u000419\u0002).\n[16] While Polar recorded FLR, a negative H bay and Pi2\npulsations were observed at midlatitude SAMNET ground\nstations (L = 2.6 \u0001 4.5, \u00020000 MLT). In spite of the\nspatially largely separated observing sites, the onset of the\nspace oscillations coincided with the onset of the ground\nPi2s. This suggests that the space FLR and ground Pi2s\nresulted from the same initial magnetospheric disturbance. It\nis somewhat surprising that the transit times from the Pi2\nsource to either of the two observing sites happen to be the\nsame. On the other hand, it cannot be ruled out that the\nspace FLR existed before the onset of ground Pi2s, and\nPolar was entering this FLR region exactly at the time of the\nground Pi2 onset. This is, however, a very unlikely scenario.\nA statistical study is planned to further investigate whether\nthe simultaneous onset time of space FLR and ground Pi2s\nwas coincidental. We conclude that our observations are one\nadditional piece of evidence that L-dependent FLR are\ngenerated at substorm onset in addition to ground Pi2s.\n[17] Although the ground and space oscillations were\nobserved at the same time, they show important differences.\nWhereas the ground Pi2s showed the same frequency over a\nwide range of L values (L \u0003 4), the in situ FLR (L \u0004 4)\nshowed L-dependent frequencies. Polar showed the location\nof the plasmapause at L = 3.7, thus placing the in situ FLR\noutside the plasmasphere. Particle data showed that the FLR\noccurred inside the plasma sheet. Because the SAMNET\nground stations were located at \u00020000 MLT and it is known\nthat the plasmapause location varies with magnetic local\ntime, in particular, it extends further out in the premidnight\nto midnight region, we cannot determine whether all ground\nstations were inside the plasmasphere. It is however most\nlikely that NUR, GML, and YOR (L = 2.57 \u0001 3.4) were\nconjugate to plasmaspheric field lines. These stations\nrecorded nearly identical Pi2 oscillations. Global oscilla-\ntions in the plasmasphere at a single frequency have been\ninterpreted by some authors as cavity-type modes which are\nstanding compressional magnetohydrodynamic waves\nbouncing between an inner and an outer boundary [e.g.,\nYeoman and Orr, 1989; Takahashi et al., 1995; Lee, 1998;\nCheng et al., 2000].\n[18] The space FLR, on the other hand, could not have\nbeen part of a possible cavity oscillation. A satellite crossing\nfield lines belonging to the cavity should detect oscillations\nat a single frequency in the magnetic field component along\nthe direction of the background magnetic field. Although\nPolar observed oscillations in all three magnetic field\ncomponents, with By being the dominant oscillation, the\noscillations do not support a cavity-type mode interpretation\nat Polar\u2019s location. Instead the L-dependence of the FLR\nfrequency is in agreement with a toroidal resonance in theFigure 4. Comparison of waveforms in space and on the\nground on 29 August 1996. The data were band-pass\nfiltered (10 s, 100 s). The first three panels show the radial\n(Bx), the field-aligned (Bz) and the azimuthal (By)\ncomponent of the magnetic field as recorded by Polar.\nThe fourth panel shows the L value (solid line) crossed by\nPolar together with the frequency variation of By (dots)\nthroughout the crossing of the plasma sheet. Arrows\nindicate phase skips. The last four panels show the H\ncomponent of SAMNET ground stations.\nFigure 5. Equatorial projection of FLR events observed\nby Polar during 1997. Note that only the nightside (1800\u2013\n0600 MLT) was surveyed.\nKEILING ET AL.: ELECTRODYNAMICS OF SUBSTORM-RELATED FLR AND Pi2 SMP 4 - 5\nplasma sheet excited by a broadband frequency source. It\nneeds to be reemphasized, however, that Polar was not\nmagnetically conjugate to the ground stations. In fact, for\nthe most part, Polar crossed field lines with L values larger\nthan those that were conjugate to the SAMNET ground\nstations (with the exception of OUL) placing Polar outside\nthe plasmasphere and most of the ground stations inside the\nplasmasphere. Thus we suggest that the oscillations inside\nthe plasmasphere and in the plasma sheet were manifesta-\ntions of two different magnetospheric oscillation modes,\nwhich is no contradiction because they occurred in different\nregions of space.\n[19] In comparison, Keiling et al. [2001b] reported strong\nFLR in the plasma sheet at \u00022300 MLT, which were also\ntriggered at substorm onset, with a significant compression-\nal component Bz. It was demonstrated that the FLR was\nmode-coupled to a fast mode wave. In their event the FLR\ndid not show any L dependence. Since the FLR had the\nsame frequency as the ground Pi2 pulsations, a cavity-type\nmode feeding the FLR was considered a possible scenario\nby the authors. In spite of the significant differences in\nspace observations of Keiling et al. [2001b] and the study\npresented here, both studies show similar ground pulsations.\nTo understand the reason why the space signatures are\ndifferent, one has to remember that the satellite observations\nof both studies were made at very different local times and\ndifferent magnetic latitudes. It is known that Pi2s in space\nare mostly observed near local midnight [Takahashi et al.,\n1995], even if they are observed well around the Earth on\nthe ground. Since our observations were made at 0330 MLT,\nit is tempting to think that a spacecraft, located at midnight\nand conjugate to the ground stations used in this study,\nwould have observed a similar signature as reported by\nKeiling et al. [2001b] (observations of fast mode waves\ncoupled to FLR). It is also possible that the larger MLAT\n(\u000419\u0002) in our study is partially responsible for a weak signal\nin Bz, because cavity-type mode oscillations are likely to\nconcentrate near the equator in dipolar geometry [Takahashi\net al., 1995].\n[20] In an attempt to explain space and ground observa-\ntions made by Lin et al. [1992], Rickard and Wright [1995]\nused a magnetospheric waveguide model. The study by Lin\net al. [1992] looked at an FLR event in the dayside which\nwas excited by solar wind variations. It was noted that the\ncompressional and the azimuthal components were differ-\nent. The compressional oscillations were less sinusoidal and\nlasted shorter than the FLR. Both the fast mode and the FLR\nshowed L-dependent frequency variations. Rickard and\nWright [1995] showed that these signatures could be sim-\nulated by assuming a waveguide model and a broadband\nsource applied to the dayside magnetosphere, simulating\nsolar wind variations. The simulation supported the view\nthat the FLR and the fast mode waves were associated with\nan MHD waveguide. This interpretation could be applied to\nthe 29 August 1996 event bearing in mind the differences,\nnamely that this event occurred in the nightside dawn flank\nand was clearly substorm-related.\n[21] The statistical study by Takahashi et al. [1996]\nrecorded most FLR events in the postmidnight sector. The\n29 August 1996 event lies in this region. Our preliminary\nresults of a statistical study of nightside FLR, using the\nPolar data set, also show FLR events predominately in the\npostmidnight sector. In addition, the Polar data set shows\nthat all events occurred outside the plasmasphere and inside\nthe plasma sheet similar to the 29 August 1996 event. Events\nwere found both very close to the inner edge of the plasma\nsheet and deeper inside the CPS. This shows that FLR can\noccur throughout the CPS. It also seems likely that FLR can\nsimultaneously occupy the entire CPS. The 29 August 1996\nevent supports this view because the latitudinal extent, as\nrecorded by Polar while crossing different L shells, was only\nlimited by the lifetime (\u000217 min) of the source as seen in the\nground Pi2. Interestingly, the in situ FLR lasted somewhat\nlonger than the ground Pi2s and also increased in intensity as\ntime went on. The different duration times may be inter-\npreted in terms of boundary differences. For the FLR the\nboundaries are the northern and southern ionospheres, but\nfor the ground Pi2s (if they are associated with trapped fast\nmode waves), boundaries in the north-south, radial, and\nazimuthal directions are required to confine the wave energy.\nThis means that the fast mode energy has more ways of\nleaking than FLR oscillations.\n[22] Acknowledgments.
