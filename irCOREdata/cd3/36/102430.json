Introduction \nestate \n4 - Low rise \nresidential \nresidential \n6 - Shopping \narea \n7 - Commercial \narea \n8 - Skyscrapers \n5 - High rise \nIt is well known that for mobile network planning, \nthe analysis of environment structures (building, \ntrees, etc.) is an important subject as it has a \nsignificant effect on the received signal strength \n[1][2]. Therefore, it is important to determine the \nclasses of a service area for systematic planning. \nEach of these service areas belonging to different \nclasses has different traffic density, mobile users' \naverage speed, different propagation losses and \nfading characteristics. For example, in downtown \nurban areas, the traffic density, propagation losses \nand fading depths are large, while the user's speed \nis slow. All of these factors affect one another, and \ntheir complex relationships are often difficult to be \ndetermined accurately. The presence of \"clutter\" \ndata can significantly refine the prediction of \nsignals, if one can exploit through data mining the \ndigital maps in Geographic Information System \n(GIS) [3]. The task of classification of the service \narea is laborious and time-consuming. In this paper, \nwe present a more efficient technique to perform \nthis task automatically. After determining the \nvarious classes of the service area, a representative \nset of data is used to train a feed-forward neural \nnetwork algorithm named Radial Basis Function \nAfter determining the various classes of the service \narea according to Table 1, a representative set of \nW F ) .  \n12-30 <600 \n13-30 600- \n1800 \n>16 ~ 1 0 0 0  \n30-45 >1800 \n24-40 >1800 \ndata is used to train a feed-forward neural network \nalgorithm named Radial Basis Function (RBF). \nRecently, RBF neural networks have proved to be a \npowerful technique in generalizing the data based \non non-linear mapping [4]. \nTable 1 Table of Zone Classifications \n1 - Seas and <o. 1 < 0.01 \nlakes \n0.2 - 0.5 \n0.6 - 0.5 \n> 0.8 \n2 - 3.5 \n> 3.5 \n1 \n11. Procedure: \nThe service area (covered by the mobile network) is \npartitioned into grids of 500m x 500 m as shown in \nFigure 1 for the southem part of Singapore. Three \nvariables used in the design are as follows: \n1. BAI% i.e. Building Area Index is the \npercentage of area occupied with buildings. \n2. SSO is the mean of the sizes of buildings. \n3. BVI% Building Volume Index i.e. the \npercentage of the volume occupied by \nbuildings (derived from building height). \n0-7803-5718-3\/00\/$10.00 02000 IEEE. 465 VTC2000 \nThese important variables were extracted from the \ninformation stored in the GIs, and input to the RBF \nneural networks (RBFNN). \nI ! .  ru \nFigure 1: Southern Map of Singapore \nwith Gridlines \nA brief description of the algorithm is given as \nfollows. The R B F \"  consists of 3 layers of \nneurons, which are fully interconnected as shown in \nFigure 2. The first layer is composed of input \nnodes. The number of nodes, p is equal to the \ndimension of the input vector xi = (BAI%, B S D  , \nBVI) (i.e., the number of independent variables of \nthe problem). The second layer is a hidden layer \ncomposed of multivariate Gaussian nonlinear units \nthat are connected directly to all of the input layer \nnodes. The function in the neurons in the second \nlayer is shown in equation (1). \n-- \nhi = exp[ -Di2\/(202)] (1) \nwhere x is an input vector \nUi is weight vector of hidden layer neuron i. \n(Note that this equals an input training \nvector.) \nx and U are column vectors \nTindicates the vector transpose \n~ j '  = (X - UST(x - UJ \nThe output layer consists of a single linear unit, \nbeing fully connected to the hidden layer and \nproduces the linear weighted summation of \nthese inputs hi. \nn \ny =  c hi wj (2) \ni=l \nwhere n is the dimension of the hidden layer. \nwj is a weight in the output layer. \nH i e n  layer \nofbssir layer \nf\"M0N \nlnplt layer \nFig. 2 Radial Basis Function Network \nThe RBFNN has to be trained with the input P = \n(xl, x2, ... , XN) data and the targets T = (tl, t2, ... , \ntN). The training is as follows. There is initially one \nneuron in the hidden layer. Firstly, ( 1 )  the network \nis trained by P and T and the input vector that will \nresult in lowering the network error (mean squared \nerror) the most, is used to determine the parameters \nof the neuron. Then, (2) the mean squared error \n(MSE) of the network is checked, and if the MSE is \nlow enough, the training is finished. Otherwise (3) \nthe next neuron is added. This procedure (1) to (3), \ncalled an epoch, is repeated until a selected MSE \ngoal is met, or the maximum number of neurons N \nis reached. In this letter, we use the RBF spread [4] \n(3 = 1 and limit the training data N < 100. After \ntraining, the other service areas can be classified \nusing the network automatically \n111. Training and Experimental Result \nThe numbers, 1 ,  2, ..., 7, 8 represent the classes as \nthe target, such as seas and lakes, open space and \nparks, industrial estate, low rise residential, high \nrise residential, shopping area, commercial area and \nsky scrapers, respectively. We trained the network \nwith different numbers of input vector and target, \nrespectively.

After training, we use \nanother set of data from another region as the input \ndata to test the RBFNN. We compared the \ncomputed result with the real classes and \ndetermined the different error rate.

The \naccuracy improves with an increase number of \ntraining data. Using only 80 training data, it \nprovides an accuracy of 94% for the classification. \nFrom this experiment, it is shown that the RBFNN \nalgorithm is a good and practical approach for land \nuse classification for mobile network planning. It is \npossible to improve the classification with more \nland usage information. \nTable 2 \nIV. Conclusions \nIn this paper, the neural network algorithm using \nRBF was used to classify the service region for \ncellular mobile communication automatically. The \nservice regions were classified according to the \nvariables i.e. Building Area Index, Mean Building \nDensity, and Building Volume Index for each grid \ngenerated through the GIs. We demonstrate that the \nR B F \"  is capable of learning the relationships \nbetween the input variables and land classes with \nthe accuracy of 74-93%. \nAcknowledgment: The author wishes to thank \nJason Tan and Kok-Kim Tan for contributing \nthrough their programming work on GIs. \nV.
