But such missions depend on domestic \nand foreign political will and they also cost scarce resources. This article \ndemonstrates that the global pattern of diplomatic representation is significantly \ndetermined by geographical distance between countries, by the power of both sending \nand recipient countries and by the degree of their ideological affinity. The pattern of \ndiplomatic representation is both a reflection of and a contributor to a world of \nnation-states dominated by geographical distance, unequal power and ideological \ndivision. \n \nKey words: diplomacy, diplomatic missions, embassies, geographical distance, power, \nideological affinity \n \nIntroduction \nDiplomatic representation serves an important function in the international system of \nnation-states. While diplomacy can be achieved by means other than diplomatic \nrepresentation, the presence of an ambassador or charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires greatly facilitates \n\u2018the management of relations between states and between states and other actors\u2019 \n(Barston 2006: 1). Through diplomatic representation states promote their political \nand economic interests, they negotiate, co-ordinate and solve problems, they gather \ninformation that is not otherwise publicly available, they convey messages to foreign \nrepresentatives, protect their own citizens, facilitate scientific and tourist exchange \n2 \nand do many other things more. More fundamentally, diplomatic representation \nfacilitates what critics have called the reification of the state (Abrams 1988), crucial at \na time when many argue that the concept of sovereign nation-states is under attack in \nan age of globalization (Trouillot 2001; Neumayer 2006). \nHosting diplomatic representations by foreign nations in one\u2019s own country is \ngenerally not any less important than establishing one\u2019s diplomatic representation \nabroad. In fact, Small and Singer (1973) take the number of diplomatic missions \npresent in a country\u2019s capital as a measure of the present recognised relative \nimportance of a state in the international system and a cause of its relative importance \nin the future. \nConsidering the importance of one\u2019s own diplomatic representations abroad and \nforeign representations at home, one may think that all countries would set up such \nrepresentation in all other countries of the world. The reality, however, looks very \ndifferent. Only about one third of all possible directed country pairs show evidence of \ndiplomatic representation in the period after the Second World War (Bayer 2006). \nEven historically, this rate has rarely been above 50 per cent (as in the beginning of \nthe 19th century), despite the international system containing far fewer sovereign \nnation states back then. \nHence, the question is why states choose to set up diplomatic representation in \nsome foreign countries, but not in others. And why are some nation-states much more \nrepresented abroad than others? Similarly, why do some nation-states host many more \nforeign representations at home than others? Figure 1 gives a graphic representation \nof the number of diplomatic missions sent and received of all countries in the world \nfor the year 2005. It demonstrates the very large variation across countries in both the \nnumber of missions sent and received. \n3 \nThere is a surprising gap in the geographical and international relations literature \non what accounts for this large variation in diplomatic representation. Russett and \nLamb (1969), Small and Singer (1973), Johns (1979), Nierop (1994) and Vogeler \n(1995) are examples of studies providing anecdotal or more systematic evidence short \nof multivariate quantitative analysis. Xierali and Liu (2006) study the size of foreign \ndiplomatic presence as measured by the number of diplomats in multivariate analysis, \nbut only for embassies accredited in the United States and for one single year only. \nThis article will study bilateral patterns of diplomatic representation over the \nperiod 1970 to 2005. I argue that three factors exert a strong influence on this pattern: \ndistance, power and ideology. Nation-states are much more likely to send an \nambassador or charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires to a country that is geographically close. Countries \nthat are economically and militarily more powerful send and receive more diplomatic \nrepresentations than less powerful countries. And, finally, countries that are \nideologically close to each other are much more likely to enjoy diplomatic exchange. \nIn the remainder of this article, I first discuss the importance of diplomatic \nrepresentation. I suggest cost, political will of the potential sending state and the veto \nright of the potential recipient states as obstacles to ubiquitous diplomatic \nrepresentation and identify geographical proximity, power and ideological affinity as \nimportant determinants of the costs and benefits of representation. This is followed by \nthe presentation of multivariate regression results, robustness tests and the concluding \nsection. \n \nThe Importance of Diplomatic Representation \nModern diplomacy is as old as the modern international system of sovereign states \nitself, with the first permanent mission having been established by the Duke of Milan \n4 \nat Genoa in the 16th century (Alger and Brams 1966). The nature and role of \ndiplomatic representation has changed much during the course of history. The \npromotion of economic interests as well as the protection of one\u2019s citizens travelling \nor living abroad has gained greatly in importance, whereas more traditional functions \nsuch as the diffusion of security threats and of military tensions have been taken over \nto some extent by the more direct involvement of heads of state and foreign ministers \n(Barston 2006).  \nDiplomatic representation is particularly important for the promotion of one\u2019s \ntrade interests. Already in 1980, Alan James (1980: 938) noted \u2018that many embassies \nspend much of their time on export promotion\u2019. Since then, if anything, this role has \nbecome more important still. Empirical studies have found that diplomatic exchange \nhas a major impact on commercial exchange between countries. Stated succinctly, \ntrade follows the flag (Pollins 1989; Rose 2007). \nCritics have argued that the importance of diplomatic exchange is either over-\nrated or at least declining over time. For example, Zbigniew Brzezinski has argued in \n1970 that if foreign ministries and embassies \u2018did not already exist, they surely would \nnot have to be invented\u2019 (cited in Hamilton and Langhorne 1995: 232). James (1980: \n933) quotes a former ambassador to Britain as saying that ambassadors and embassies \n\u2018are obsolescent and, if things continue as they are (\u2026) will rapidly become obsolete\u2019. \nModern communication technology may have indeed rendered some of the \ncommunication and information gathering functions of diplomatic representations less \npertinent (Barston 2006). However, the enduring reality of diplomatic exchange \ndemonstrates that nation-states continue to appreciate its importance. In fact, as \nHamilton and Langhorne (1995: 233) have pointed out, countries rarely break off \ndiplomatic relations, close down embassies or downgrade them to mere consulates \n5 \nother than temporarily, even after revolutionary regime changes at home. The reason \nis simple: \u2018In truth, there are few satisfactory alternatives to the resident envoy\u2019 \n(ibid.). \nThe very fact that countries use the, often temporary, severing of diplomatic ties \nas a means to communicate an important and strong message to the targeted state \nserves to demonstrate the enduring importance of diplomatic exchange.1 Even in the \ncase of temporary or more permanent embassy closure friendly embassies are \nfrequently asked to host an interest section where diplomats \u2013 other than the \nambassador \u2013 from the closed embassy continue to work in the interest of the country \n(Watson 1984). As Berridge (1994: 38ff.) points out, such interest sections are, \nhowever, no real substitute for having one\u2019s own embassy. Hence, states are typically \neager to renew their diplomatic exchange as soon as the temporary period of \nseverance has passed. \n \nObstacles to Diplomatic Representation \nGiven the importance of diplomatic representation, why is it not ubiquitous? There \nare three main reasons why a state may not be diplomatically present in all foreign \ncountries. One is cost, one is lack of political will, while the third is the veto right of \nthe receiving state. Starting with the first reason, the setting up and maintenance of \ndiplomatic representations create both capital and current costs. In addition, such \nrepresentations need to be staffed by diplomatic personnel that speak the local \nlanguage and are willing to live in a certain foreign country for a number of years. \n                                                 \n1\n As Berridge (1994: 7f.) points out the use of severing diplomatic ties as a signalling device was \ntraditionally used as a prelude to war. Nowadays, it is used as a device to send strong signals of \ndissatisfaction without necessarily any military intentions.  \n6 \nYet, even if diplomatic representation abroad were costless, countries would not \nwant to open embassies in every other country. Domestic opposition or foreign \npressure may prevent a country from being represented in a foreign country, usually \nbecause of ideological reasons. For example, before Nixon went to China and thus \npaved the way for the establishment of an American embassy in Beijing, domestic \nanti-communist opposition prevented American presidents from doing so and likewise \nAmerican pressure on some of its foreign allies prevented them from exchanging \ndiplomatic relations with China. Opening diplomatic representation in one country \ncan also mean losing it in another. For example, the price for diplomatic relations with \nmainland China is always the loss, if existent, of relations with Taiwan. \nWhile cost considerations and lack of political will in the sending country imply \nthat not all countries would want to be diplomatically represented in all other \ncountries, political considerations in the recipient state imply that not all countries \nwould be able to open embassies in every other country, even if they could afford and \nwanted to do so. This is because the receiving state can discourage diplomatic \nrepresentation of a particular foreign state in its own country. In its most extreme \nform, it can even refuse to recognise the state that is eager to establish a diplomatic \nrepresentation. Whilst generally rather uncommon, some states such as Israel, North \nKorea and Taiwan or, in the past, Rhodesia and East Germany suffered from more or \nless widespread refusal to recognise its status as an independent, sovereign nation-\nstate. States that struggle for recognition often use economic incentives to induce \nforeign countries to exchange diplomatic representation. Others, particularly so states, \nwhich compete with them for diplomatic recognition (such as Western Germany and \nSouth Korea in the past and China up to this day), use such incentives to dissuade \nthese same countries from doing so (Newnham 2000). But even if countries formally \n7 \nrecognise each other, they can still signal that the establishment of a formal \ndiplomatic representation is unwanted. This forces interested foreign states to either \nopen consulates instead, which are usually constrained to perform some low-key \nadministrative tasks and are thus no rival to the multiple functions of embassies \n(Berridge 1994), or not to be represented at all. As James (1980: 940) points out \u2018an \nembassy is, literally and figuratively, showing the flag\u2019 and some flags are non grata \nin certain foreign countries. \nIn one way or another, there are therefore costs and benefits to both sending and \nrecipient states considering to open diplomatic representation in each other\u2019s country. \nThe costs need to be balanced against the benefits and the benefit-cost ratio will be \ninfluenced by both factors of the sending state and the potential recipient state as well \nas the relations between them. The benefit-cost ratio will also change over time. There \nis, however, a certain path-dependency in diplomatic representation over time \u2013 once \nestablished, diplomatic representations may persist despite the costs growing larger \nthan the benefits. For example, MacRae (1989) attributes the large number of \ndiplomatic representations in London partly to such persistence, which perpetuates the \neffect of Britain\u2019s imperial heritage on its current relations. However, the verdict of \nSmall and Singer (1973: 582) still holds true: \u2018In one way or another, every \ngovernment is faced periodically with the need to estimate, or re-estimate, how \n\u201cimportant\u201d it is to exchange missions with every other one in the system.\u2019 Nierop \n(1994: 66) similarly argues that patterns of diplomatic representation \u2018reflect \ndeliberate political action\u2019 and that diplomatic presence is \u2018an indication of the \nsalience between partners exceeding a certain minimum threshold\u2019. \n \n8 \nThe Costs and Benefits of Diplomatic Representation \nWhat then determines the costs and benefits of diplomatic representation? This article \nargues that geographical distance, ideological affinity and power status play important \nroles. Countries that are located close to each other typically share many interests and \nare characterised by a high level of mutual interaction. There is often a high degree of \neconomic exchange and travel between geographically close countries. Even if \ngeographically proximate countries wanted to, it would be very difficult to be \nindifferent to each other. For these reasons, geographical proximity raises the benefits \nfrom diplomatic representation. It also lowers the cost. It is cheaper to set up and \nmaintain embassies in close countries and easier to persuade staff to move to such \ncountries, where the climate and culture is similar and home with all its amenities \n(food, media, schools for the children etc.) is not far away. \nOne of the functions of diplomatic representation is to maintain and foster \nfriendly relations between states. Ideological affinity typically leads to friendly \nrelations as sharing a particular view of the world generates a sense of belonging to \nthe same group. For example, Western countries share similar views on democracy \nand human rights. Communist countries used to have similar ideas about state \nownership of the means of production. Predominantly Muslim countries share similar \nideas about the role of religion in politics. Ideological affinity thus raises the benefits \nof diplomatic representation and promises its smooth functioning given the friendly \nrelations it is supposed to maintain, thus also lowering the costs of representation. \nThe more powerful countries are the more they wish to be recognized as such by \nother countries. Being represented in a large number of foreign countries as well as \nhosting a large number of foreign countries\u2019 embassies in one\u2019s own country \nsymbolises and represents power. However, diplomatic representation goes far \n9 \nbeyond the symbolic. If power means exerting an influence on the political, economic \nand military affairs of other countries, then diplomatic representation is an important \nvehicle with which more powerful countries transmit, project and impose their power \non foreign countries. Conversely, more powerful countries are more interesting hosts \nto foreign countries for their diplomatic representation abroad. It facilitates access to \nthose who matter in international affairs. \nPower also qualifies the impact of ideological affinity on diplomatic \nrepresentation. Ideologically close countries share common interests and are therefore \nmore likely to exchange diplomatic relations. However, countries with different views \ncannot be simply ignored if they are powerful. Take the relations between Western \nand Communist countries during the Cold War as an example. Smaller Western \ncountries may not have had an incentive to send diplomatic relations to smaller \nCommunist countries, and vice versa. However, they could not ignore the big players \nin the other camp. Diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and China were vital \nfor Western countries, powerful or not, while such relations with the United States, \nthe United Kingdom, France and perhaps Germany were important even to the less \npowerful Communist countries. Conversely, the big players on either side of the iron \ncurtain needed to maintain diplomatic relations with countries of the other side, \npowerful or not, to assert their power status. \nIn general, there is a very high degree of reciprocity in diplomatic representation. \nIn about 90 per cent of dyads during the period of our study, a pair of countries had \neither no representation in either one or both were represented in each other\u2019s country. \nHowever, some countries receive or send many more diplomatic representations than \nthey send or receive, respectively. For example, during the period of our study, \nBelgium, Luxembourg, Kenya and Ethiopia have received many more missions than \n10 \nthey have sent abroad. Brussels is attractive because it is the major host of the \nEuropean Union at which countries want to be represented, thus dramatically \nlowering the costs of having full diplomatic relations with Belgium.2 Kenya is a major \naid recipient, location of Western tourism and host to the only significant United \nNations organization located outside developed countries. At the other end of the \nspectrum are countries like the two Korean states, which compete for diplomatic \nrecognition and are therefore keen to send missions abroad even if the host country \ndoes not reciprocate. Interestingly, some of the more powerful nations such as China, \nIndia and Brazil also send more representations abroad than they receive. \n \nEmpirical Analysis \nOur dependent variable is a directed dyadic dichotomous variable that is set to one if \nthere is evidence of the potential sending country having sent either a charg\u00e9 \nd\u2019affaires, a minister or ambassador to the potential receiving country, and zero \notherwise.3 Charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires and ministers were more commonly used in the past; in \nrecent decades ambassadors have become the norm of diplomatic representation. \nInterest sections maintained by other embassies and mere consulate-generals are not \ncounted as diplomatic representation and are thus coded as zero. The data have been \ncollected by Bayer (2006) and exist for every five-year period between 1970 and \n                                                 \n2\n The European Union represents a very special case, being the only supra-national entity to send and \nreceive diplomatic missions. \n3\n Ideally, one would like to measure not just the presence or absence of diplomatic representation, but \nalso its size. However, no such data exist for a global sample. \n11 \n2005.4 Due to the dichotomous nature of the dependent variable, we use a logit \nestimator (probit leads to very similar results). The observations are clustered at the \ndyadic level to ensure that the estimations are robust to both arbitrary \nheteroscedasticity and autocorrelation. \nOur main explanatory concepts are distance, power and ideology. The first is \nmeasured by the natural log of the air distance in kilometres between the capital cities \nof the two countries, with data taken from Bennett and Stam (2003).5 To capture the \npower dimension, we take the first principal component of a measure of military and \nof economic power. Military power is measured by the widely used Composite Index \nof National Capacity (CINC) score, taken from the Correlates of War project \n(www.correlatesofwar.org\/), first pioneered by Singer, Bremer and Stukey (1972). A \ncountry\u2019s CINC score is a composite measure of its total population, urban \npopulation, iron and steel production, energy consumption, military personnel, and \nmilitary expenditure. Economic power is approximated by the natural log of a \ncountry\u2019s total GDP in constant US$, with data taken from Maddison (2007). \nIdeological affinity cannot be measured directly. As a proxy for it, we use \nGartzke\u2019s (2006) affinity of nations index. The index is based on voting behaviour in \nthe United Nations (UN) General Assembly. It is based on a conceptualisation of two \npolitical positions as falling within a space defined by all the possible political \n                                                 \n4\n From 1985, the data only count diplomatic representation if the ambassador or equivalent is \nphysically resident in the recipient country, whereas before he or she could also reside in neighbouring \ncountries. Results are not affected by restricting the sample to the period 1985 to 2005 only. \n5\n A small minority of diplomatic representations are not located in the capital, but in another city of the \ncountry. No attempt was made to adjust the distance measure for these cases. The reason is that the \nvariable measures the distance between the political centres of the dyad, not the distance between the \nactual locations of diplomatic missions. \n12 \npositions. The index is constructed such that the affinity between any two nations at \nany point in time falls in the interval from -1 to 1, where -1 means that two political \npositions are as far apart in the space as possible (complete dissimilarity, i.e. voting \ncontrary in each instance) and 1 means that the two political positions are identical \n(complete similarity, i.e. voting identically in each instance). Gartzke (2006) argues \nthat because of the often symbolic nature of UN General Assembly votes, such voting \nbehaviour provides a good approximation to revealed state preferences and the voting \nsimilarity thus offers a good approximation to ideological affinity. It is of course not a \nperfect measure, but it is consistent with basic a priori expectations about the \nideological affinity of nations. For example, during the Cold War period Western and \nCommunist states voting behaviour was quite dissimilar, whereas the voting amongst \nthe respective allies was quite similar. To account for our theoretical argument that \nideological affinity only plays a role if the potential receiving or sending countries are \nnot very powerful, we interact the power variables with the ideological affinity \nvariable. \nIn terms of control variables, we include the natural log of per capita income of \nboth sending and receiving states (data from Maddison 2007). Richer sending \ncountries are in a better position to afford diplomatic representation abroad. Richer \nreceiving countries are of potential greater interest to sending countries. Second, in an \nearly contribution, Brams (1966) suggested that, besides geographical proximity, \ncolonial ties play an important role in patterns of diplomatic exchange. We include a \ndummy variable to account for former colonial links between states, also counting the \nlink between the Russian Federation and the former Soviet Union republics as this \namounts to a quasi-former colonial relationship. Data are taken from Neumayer \n(2003). Third, due to inertia and persistence in the system of diplomatic \n13 \nrepresentation, countries which have been independent for a longer period of time can \nbe expected to have generated a greater number of representations over time, both \nabroad and domestically. To control for this possibility, we include the year of \nindependence of both sending and receiving states, with data taken from Gleditsch \nand Ward (1999). Finally, to account for common time trends affecting all countries\u2019 \npropensity to send or receive diplomatic representation equally, we include period-\nspecific time dummies in the estimations. Table 1 provides descriptive statistical \ninformation on the variables. Note that for each period the respective value at the \nbeginning of the period was taken for each of the explanatory variables. \n \nResults \nTable 2 presents the estimation results. As expected, geographical distance matters: \nmore proximate countries are more likely to open a diplomatic representation than \nmore distant countries. Also in line with theory, the power status of both sending and \nrecipient country exert a significantly positive effect on the likelihood of diplomatic \npresentation. Mower powerful countries are both more likely to send missions abroad \nand more likely to receive missions. The former effect is slightly stronger, but the \nconfidence intervals of the two estimated coefficients overlap, so the difference is not \nstatistically significant. Ideological affinity makes diplomatic representation more \nlikely. However, as expected, the negative coefficients of the interaction effects \nbetween power of both sending and recipient states and their degree of affinity \nsuggests that the positive effect of ideological affinity is decreasing as the power of \neither recipient or sending states increases. In fact, whereas the probability of having a \ndiplomatic representation in a country of average power goes down by .05 as \nideological affinity goes down from average to minimum, holding all other variables \n14 \nat their mean, there is no negative effect of decreasing ideological affinity for a very \npowerful potential recipient country.6 A very similar result holds true for power status \nof a potential sending country. What this means is that ideological affinity has a \npositive effect on the likelihood of diplomatic representation as long as neither the \npotential sending nor the potential recipient state is very powerful. \nAs for the control variables, GDP per capita in both sending and recipient \ncountries exerts a positive influence on the likelihood of diplomatic representation, as \nexpected. The confidence intervals overlap, so there is no statistically significant \ndifference between the two variables. Former colonial ties do not have a statistically \nsignificant effect on patterns of diplomatic representation. The pseudo R2 of the \nmodel is 0.29, which is relatively high, suggesting that the model provides a relatively \ngood fit to the pattern of diplomatic representation. About 81 per cent of observations \nare correctly classified. That is, for about 8 out of 10 observations the model correctly \npredicts the presence or absence of diplomatic representation. \nIn column II, we add a dummy variable for diplomatic representation of the \npotential receiving country in the potential sending country. In other words, it is set to \none if the potential receiving country has itself established a diplomatic mission in the \npotential sending country, and zero otherwise. This variable is a-theoretical, but it can \ncontrol for the very strong degree of reciprocity in diplomatic relations, which, as \nmentioned already, is close to 90 per cent. Naturally, the coefficient of this variable is \nhighly statistically significant and it pushes the Pseudo R2 up to 0.5. About 88 per \ncent of observations are now correctly classified. Interestingly, despite absorbing an \nenormous amount of variation in the data, the results from column I nevertheless by \n                                                 \n6\n This cannot be directly observed from the estimation results presented in table 2, but can be derived \nfrom predicted values. \n15 \nand large uphold. In particular, geographical distance and power status still matter, \neven though the respective sizes of the coefficients change of course. The ideological \naffinity variable becomes marginally insignificant and its interaction with power of \nthe potential sending country more clearly insignificant. \n \nRobustness tests \nOur main result \u2013 that the pattern of diplomatic representation is largely shaped by \ngeographical proximity, power and ideological affinity \u2013 is robust to a number of \nalterations to the model. First, it is robust to adding further explanatory variables. For \nexample, one can account for the inertia in the system of diplomatic representation by \nincluding a lagged dependent variable. The pseudo R2 rises quite dramatically to 0.64 \nand the percentage of correctly classified observations rises less dramatically to 91.6 \nper cent. Importantly, however, while the coefficient sizes change of course in the \npresence of a lagged dependent variable, all the explanatory variables remain \nstatistically significant. \nBilateral trade between countries was not included in the estimations because the \nliterature suggests that \u201ctrade follows the flag\u201d rather than the other way around. \nHowever, our results are little affected if we include bilateral trade divided by the \nGDP of the potential sending country, which, as expected, has a positive and \nstatistically significant coefficient sign.  \nNewly independent states typically rush to open diplomatic representations \nabroad (James 1980). As the euphoria vanishes and the budget constraints become \nclearer, some of these representations are closed again. One can test for a non-linear \neffect of an explanatory variable on the dependent variable by additionally including \nits squared term. If we do so for the year of independence of the sending country \n16 \nvariable, then we find indeed a non-linear effect. A more recent year of independence \nfirst raises, but then decreases the likelihood of sending a diplomatic mission to the \npotential recipient country. \nRegime type combinations may affect the pattern of diplomatic representation. If \nwe employ the commonly used Polity IV measure of democracy, then pairs of \ndemocracies and pairs of autocracies are more likely to exchange diplomatic missions \nthan if one of the country is democratic and the other is autocratic, the omitted \nreference category. These regime type combinations are correlated with the \nideological affinity variable, but nevertheless the results uphold. \nSecond, I divided the sample into a Cold War and post-Cold War period, but \nfound that the results are very much the same in both periods. This corroborates the \nfinding that these are fundamental and persistent determinants of diplomatic \nrepresentation. \nThird, our main result is also robust to using a probit, random-effects logit or \npopulation-averaged logit estimator instead of the standard logit estimator with \nclustered standard errors. Given the high degree of persistence in diplomatic relations \nthere is relatively little variation over time compared to the cross-dyadic variation. It \nis therefore not surprising that fixed-effects logit estimation is very inefficient, \nrendering most of the explanatory variables statistically insignificant. \n \nConclusion \nThe analysis presented here suggests reasons why we have not seen, nor are likely to \nsee in the near future, a decline in the extent and importance of diplomatic \nrepresentation. Diplomatic representation is beneficial to both sending and recipient \ncountries. More fundamentally, the substance and symbolism of diplomatic missions \n17 \nis crucial in defending the precarious role of the state in an era of globalization. \nDiplomatic representation fulfils an important function in maintaining and reinforcing \nthe modern system of sovereign nation-states. \nDiplomatic representation is also costly, however, in both narrow economic and \nwider political terms, which prevents countries from sending missions to and \nreceiving missions from all other countries. This study has demonstrated that the \npattern of diplomatic representation is shaped to a significant extent by geographical \nproximity, power and ideological affinity. Yet, given its important political and \neconomic functions, diplomatic representation in turn also reinforces the tyranny of \ngeographical distance, the inequality of power and the division of countries along \nideological lines. The pattern of diplomatic representation is thus both a reflection of \nand a contributing force to the spatial, unequal and divided world we continue to live \nin. \n18 \nReferences \nAbrams P 1988 Notes on the Difficulty of Studying the State (1977) Journal of \nHistorical Sociology 1 58-89 \nAlger C F and Brams S J 1967 Patterns of representation in national capitals and \ninter-governmental organizations World Politics 19 646-663 \nBarston R P 2006 Modern diplomacy.
