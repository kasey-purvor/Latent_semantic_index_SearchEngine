In addition, the paper also introduces three other \nrecent\/on-going projects carried out at Cranfield University in the application of PDM, knowledge \nmanagement and STEP standard for integrated manufacturing business. \n \n1    INTRODUCTION \n \nProduct Data Management (PDM) systems have been widely used in industry now after \nsignificant research and development effort made over a decade. However, the primary \napplications of these tools so far have been limited to the engineering side of the enterprise, \nalthough PDM systems are designed for and capable of managing enterprise-wide information \nespecially with the latest Web-based technologies (Yen, D.C, 2002). Bi-directional \ncommunications with ERP, manufacturing planning and Customer Relation Management (CRM) \nsystems consist of very simple interfaces and data exchange with no real-time interoperability \nbetween the different functions of the enterprise. In addition, the theme of the extended PDM, that \nis Collaborative Product Development or Product Lifecycle Management, still lacks the essential \n\u201cdevelopment\u201d aspects and acts simply as a gateway for sharing designs, documents and effect \nrevision control, engineering change and workflow. Knowledge management capability especially \nthose for conceptual design stage is absent in the commercial PDM systems. This is however \nadvancing at a rapid pace in the current commercial arena. This paper gives an overview of the \ncurrent trend in PDM systems development and their applications within the extended enterprise, \nand introduces the methodologies being developed in an on-going research project sponsored by \nthe Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) which aims to develop PDM \ntechnologies further to remedy some of the current shortcomings. Three other related projects \ncarried out at Cranfield University are also described. \n \n1.1 PDM Technologies in Enterprise \n \nThere is a wide variation in the functionalities offered by PDM systems depending on the \nrequirements of the target markets. At the basic level (or \u2018low end\u2019) a PDM system provides \nsimple data storage, document management, revision\/change\/access control, project and \nworkflow management, and simple interfaces with other systems (see website: www.pdmic.com).  \nThere is no direct interface to ERP, Customer Relation Management (CRM) or manufacturing \nplanning systems and it generally uses a less complicated database which doesn\u2019t offer such \nadvanced functionality as concurrent view\/modification of data, data replication and scalability \noffered by the \u2018high end\u2019 solutions. They also generally lack direct interface with CAD systems, or \noffer a very simplified connection with data check-in and check-out functionalities. These low end \nPDM systems are  more suitable for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that only need a \nsingle server and have less complex relationships with a supply chain. The high end systems are \nmore sophisticated with customisable and scalable solutions which offer enterprises the ability to \nconnect distributed design and manufacturing sites together to work collaboratively on product \ndevelopment and also allow the supply chain and customers to be involved and access \/ modify \ndata during the project\u2019s lifecycle. High end PDM systems offer a number of different methods for \neither connecting to or offering ERP functionality. Some systems, such as PTC\u2019s Windchill used \nin this project (see Website: www.ptc.com), offer a connection gateway through a proprietary \napplication layer within the application (in this case Info*Engine) and through this gateway any \nexternal application has bi-directional access to data stored in a Windchill repository in real time. \nHowever even such connectivity contradicts the ERP philosophy of storing all the data of the \nenterprise in a single repository. \n \nThe next route taken by vendors is to supply specific \u2018plug-in\u2019s for different ERP systems. This \nhas achieved a certain level of interoperability. However, the systems were still separated at the \ncore logic and data level. Even if they can, in theory, share the same database, vendors generally \nshy away from it. On highly customisable solutions such as Enovia from IBM Dassault (see \nWebsite: www.enovia.com) and Metaphase from SDRC (see Website: \nwww.sdrc.com\/metaphase\/). it is possible to integrate the data and logic \/ rules of the PDM \nsystem with the enterprise system via major and costly customisation. But the real problem is the \ndefinition and standardisation of the data\/knowledge to be exchanged, and this has not been \nsolved. The product data generated during an engineering project would be useful in an ERP \nenvironment to help plan the resources necessary for the successful realisation of the project. \nTraditionally, data transfer and co-operation between the \u201ctechnical\u201d and \u201cnon-technical\u201d divisions \nof enterprises has been lacking. Today companies have to operate in a concurrent engineering \nenvironment, and this in turn entails multi-disciplinary work teams and sharing of the project \ndevelopment data at every stage. To enable this, engineers have to use the functionality of ERP \nsystems to assess resource availability as well as enable marketing personnel and accounts to \ndirect access the project in a product oriented view. The links between the \u201ctechnical\u201d and \u201cnon-\ntechnical\u201d parts of the enterprise can be made using either the ERP system or the PDM system, \nalthough inevitably, the two separate systems, one product oriented and the other resource \noriented, will remain. \n \n1.2 Trend of PDM Development \n \nThe original PDM paradigm has been extended to encompass the supply chain of the enterprise \nwithin the framework of its internal product development processes, and many of the PDM \nvendors are including functionality to enable customers to access selected data from the PDM \nportal. This extended PDM is referred to as Collaborative Product Development (CPD) or Product \nLifecycle Management (PLM) system (see Website: www.ptc.com). This category of products \nimproved the ability of enterprises in effective supply chain management and collaboration \nconcurrently on product development between separate offices and also with the sub-contractors. \nCPD systems, however, do have many of the shortcomings. The software is still only a \u201cportal\u201d for \nstoring data and managing projects. The next step in the evolutionary development will be the \nconcurrent and collaborative design of products online. It was reported that (Greco 2001) Alibre, \n3G Corporation and ImpactXoft have solutions that enable online collaborative design using solid \nmodelling tools. CPAD (Shyamsundar and Gadh, R., 2001) and Syco3D (Nam and Wright 2001) \nare experimental tools to allow the generation of geometry as well as the classification of \nassemblies and parts into libraries for re-use. However there is no provision in these systems to \nenable collaborative working in real-time, or to generate STEP compatible outputs for later \nprocessing. \n \n1.3 PDM and the STEP Standard \n \nPDM vendors use their own proprietary standards to define the product data within their own \nsystems, although many do output XML format data (see Young 2000 about XML). This non-\nstandardised format increases the cost of customisation needed to transfer information  between \ndifferent vendors\u2019 software products. The STEP PDM schema (ISO 1999) is a subset of a number \nof STEP Application Protocols (APs). It contains many, but not all, the requirements of PDM \nsystems. It contains functionality for both parts and documents (identification, versioning, \nstructures, approvals, authorisation, project, work order, requests, effectiveness, classification \nand properties). The STEP PDM schemas offer vendors the ability to standardise the \nfunctionality, using common nomenclature for much of the functionality of PDM systems, whilst \nallowing them to extend the functionality using either EXPRESS schemas, or other programming \ntools. The PDM schemas are  generic in nature and can be applied to most electro\/mechanical \napplications with ease, and can also ensure ease of access to the part information from the \nIndustry standard STEP-based Boundary Representation (B-Rep) models. \n \nThere are other models for PDM interoperability (Oh 2001) being developed using UML to map \nthe data between generic CAD and PDM systems. However, this does not provide the same level \nof support or acceptance as ISO standard-based schemas such as the PDM-Schemas. The \nwidespread adoption of PDM Schemas would herald new levels of interoperability between \nenterprise level systems with very little customisation. It also opens up the possibility of \nstreamlining many applications that feed data into PDM\/ERP systems through the  use of STEP \nnative product models and data. This project has been initiated to explore the possibilities of \napplying STEP technologies for production applications and to drive collaborative and concurrent \nengineering design. \n \n1.4 PDM and Knowledge Tools \n \nGenerally commercial PDM systems lack knowledge management capabilities. There are \nresearch prototype tools which aim to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into PDM systems such \nas  the Distributed Open Intelligent PDM System developed by Kim et al (Kim 2001). The \nphilosophy behind this particular PDM implementation is the use of open-standard tools and file \nformats. The PDM system includes most software tools available in other PDM applications such \nas PTC Windchill. There are a number of unique features in this implementation. The use of \nintelligent agents to perform many of the PDM tasks and Knowledge Query and Manipulation \nLanguage  for queries sets it apart from other PDM implementations. The PDM software consists \nof  a dynamic and flexible workflow model, as opposed to the rigid workflows seen in many \ncommercial PDM applications. This greatly enhanced the flexibility and therefore usability of the \nsystem in a real-world situation. In addition, the program is designed from the outset for the use of \nSTEP based model files to store and distribute product information. STEP Data Access Interface \nis used for content searching of Product data. However, no mention was made about which \nApplication Protocol of STEP they intended to use. The research project carried out at Cranfield \nUniversity in integrating PDM with knowledge tools will be described later in this paper. \n \n2 THE METHODOLOGIES BEING DEVELOPED \n \nThe project is mainly devoted to the key issues of supporting the concurrent and multi-disciplinary \nproduct development process in a collaborative and distributed environment. The conceptual \ndesign phase of new product development is deemed to be the area where large savings in time \nand cost can be made by integrating the engineering, manufacturing and resource planning \nfacets of the enterprise. Therefore the focus is on the development of a conceptual design \nenvironment with new tools, knowledge and integration methodologies. The software items used \nas the basis of the project included a mixture of commercial and academic developments. On the \ncommercial side PTC's Windchill CPD application is used. This application server is written in \nJava2 and uses an Oracle 8i database. Service to clients is through a Web browser and this is \nenabled via Apache Web server and the Tomcat Servlet engine. The functionality that Windchill \ndoesn\u2019t include as standard is provided and integrated during this project. \n \n2.1 Integration of PDM and Expert System \n \nFirst, a generic expert system development tool based on the RETE algorithm - Prot\u00e9g\u00e9-2000 is \nincluded. It has been developed by Stanford University and written in Java2 (Stanford University, \n2002). The whole package includes an automatically generated forms based user interface for \nany expert system that is defined within Prot\u00e9g\u00e9. In addition, the program has the ability to store \nthe knowledge base in many different formats, such as CLIPS (Giarratano 2000), XML, Resource \nDescription Format (RDF) and through a Java Database Connectivity interface straight to a \ndatabase. Resource Description Format is found to be the most advantageous format for the \nknowledge base. The knowledge in the knowledge base is defined as text (Rogers 1998). The \nprogram can be packaged into a single Java Archive and distributed as an applet to Windchill \nclients during runtime. In order to define rules within Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 the Java Expert System Shell \n(JESS) was added as a plug-in. This enables standard CLIPS rules to be added to the knowledge \nbase. \n \nThe primary aim of this knowledge base is to enable the conceptual product development system \nto manage knowledge in a more intelligent way rather than simply document management \nenvironment. It also enables the project co-ordinator to specify the ontology within their \nknowledge base thereby standardising the nomenclature and vocabulary used by all persons \nentering or modifying project information. There are already some implementations of rule-based \nexpert systems to aid in the definition of designs using lifecycle information as \u2018features (Esterline \n1993, Zhang 2002). These however, like CADET (Rogers 1998), do not include feature geometry \nor machining features. The solution proposed in this paper may sound inflexible but the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9-\n2000 Expert System editor enables very intuitive and graphical user interface based control of the \nunderlying ontology of the knowledge base. This also means that information such as customer \nrequirements and concept design specifications can be managed more efficiently and yet allow \nthe PDM project managers to tailor the ontology for each project separately.  \n \nThe project data is stored in standard Windchill cabinets and, using Windchill\u2019s data manager; \nmodel information can be translated on the fly from most CAD formats to STEP part 21 files. \nProcesses for entering knowledge into the knowledge base can be included as part of the \nworkflow and persons delegated tasks for entering particular data. In this project a specific \nontology was developed taking as an example an automotive supply company. This is an ideal \nexample as the company operates over many different sites, and has very close links both to \nOEMs (its customers) and to specialised manufacturing firms (its supply chain). Figure 1 shows \nthe simplified design process of the collaborating company. \n \n Figure 1: The Simplified Product Design Process of the Collaborating Company \n \nThe customer requirements are classified into classes and slots within Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a small-scale \nknowledge base about a long term project for an OEM is built. The customer requirement \nknowledge is a particularly important area for the Tier-1 supplier to investigate as dealing with \nmany different OEMs who use different vocabularies to describe essentially the same \nspecifications. Often this confuses the engineering teams who try to draw up the concept design \nspecifications, generate quotations, estimate resource needs and the practicality of the \ncustomer\u2019s requests. During this phase of the project it is very important to link together the items \nof information essential for the accurate estimation of: \n \n\u2022 Best design concepts\/configurations; \n\u2022 Likely cost of items based on historical data from earlier projects with similar \nconfigurations; \n\u2022 Likely time-frame for developing\/producing the items and estimating the necessary \nresources to be allocated; and \n\u2022 Generating conceptual BoM and process plans for early analysis of best concepts \nintended for design for manufacture and assembly. \nYES \nNO \nCustomer \nspecification \ninput. \nPaper \nsketch \/ \nWhiteboard\n2D CAD \ndrawing \n3D CAD \nmodels \nMake \nsamples \nand Rapid \nPrototypes \nTest and \nvalidate the \ndesign \nproposal \nMeet \ndesign \nspec? \nMove to next phase \n The personnel involved in conceptual design must have easy access to historical conceptual \ndesign information from previous projects to learn from earlier experience, and access to \nresource planning and accounting data in a project oriented view that allows them to estimate \nlikely costs, benefits, manufacturing and resource issues.  \n \n2.2    Integration of PDM with Manufacturing Planning \n \nThe process planning system to be integrated is CAPABLE developed by Durham University as a \nrough cut process and resource planning tool for conceptual design (Maropoulos 1998). It is also \nwritten in Java2 and uses an Oracle 8i database. The system generates plans from non-\ngeometric feature models defined as Java classes. In this project,  the STEP AP-224 (SCRA \n2001) machining features definition for process planning application protocol is used as the basis \nfor the feature models to be integrated and analysed, as it will be seen later. AP-224 is also used \nto generate and store feature-complete solid models for conceptual designs. The second \napplication used is a commercial process planning tool LOCAM provided by LSC Group. It is the \nfirst application that can take a STEP AP-224 part-21 file as input and automatically generate a \nprocess plan from it. This however depends on the creation of the manufacturing rules database. \nThe LOCAM program will be used to generate process plans in real-time as the model is being \ncreated to enable the designers to intuitively make changes and assess the design from the \nconceptual stage. This program is packaged as an ActiveX Dynamically Loaded Libraries (DLLs\u2019) \nand will be integrated with the AP-224 modeller in a unified user interface.  \n \n2.3 Integration of PDM with ERP \n \nThe integration with ERP system enables the project team to interact with accounting and \nmaterial resource planning functions of the enterprise to optimise the design from the earliest \nphase. Integrating with the supply chain in cases of companies where significant amount of work \nis sub-contracted reduces the amount of time and money spent on engineering change. The \nintegration will primarily be between CAPABLE and Windchill with the ERP system SAP\/R3, \nthrough Windchill\u2019s Info*Engine access layer, which provides the resource and manufacturing \ninformation. This enables relevant resource information to be displayed as part of the Windchill \nproject vault. However, in order to access information from the ERP system the team have to \nconstruct a program that can send queries to retrieve the correct information from SAP and also \nto construct process plans in order to analyse its manufacturability. It is also planned to integrate \nthe PDM system with ERP system PICS in the later stage which is implemented in one of the \ncollaborating companies.  \n \n2.4   The PDM-based Conceptual Design Environment \n \nIn order to create the process plans and feed data into the PDM systems a conceptual design \nenvironment that is easy to use and integrate with the other components of the system is needed. \nFigure 2 shows the relationship of the tools within the design environment being developed.  \n \n \nFigure 2: Schematic Diagram of the Conceptual Design System \n \nKnowledge Based Conceptual Design Environment \nbased on PRO\/DESKTOP (to create parts and assemblies in AP-224) \nWindchill \nVisualisation \nand \nCollaboration \nservice \nProt\u00e9g\u00e9-2000 Expert \nSystem environment. \nRDF knowledge bases. \nTemp \ncache \nConcept \ndesign \nCustomer \nrequests \nWINDCHILL Collaborative Product \nDevelopment System Wrapper. \nAP-224 \nfeatures\nAP-224 \nmodels\nAP-224 \ndefaults\nEngineering and manufacturing data Customer requirements\/marketing \nLOCAM process \nplanning \nCAPABLE \naggregate \nplanning \nThe Pro\/Desktop 2001 solid modeller from PTC was chosen for a number of reasons, i.e.,  \n\u2022 The software can be distributed over the Windchill system to clients; \n\u2022 ActiveX Dynamically Loaded Libraries (DLL) and Visual Basic for Applications macros can \nbe integrated; \n\u2022 It supports most of the features of 3D CAD tools (In fact it uses the same kernel, Granite1, \nas Pro\/Engineer 2001); \n\u2022 Feature primitives can be defined for drag-and-drop functionality, enabling the \nconstruction of AP-224 feature models with ease; and \n\u2022 Integration with Windchill is possible through PTC\u2019s Pro\/Intralink interface. \n \nThe software is modified to output AP-224 files to enable other applications to process it and to \ngenerate process and resource plans. The AP-224 file generation is done in two steps. First, the \nfeature geometry is generated using the 16 base machining features of AP-224. Then, the \nremainder of the information is entered using forms. Where possible, default values are supplied \nfor the forms to reduce the amount of form filling necessary to make the AP-224 files. LOCAM is \nalso integrated through ActiveX DLL which allows the generation of process plans during the \nconcept model creation process, optimisation of the design for manufacturing and assembly from \nthe first phases of design.  \n \nThe output from this phase enables applications such as CAPABLE to generate generic process \nand resource plans and to supply data to ERP systems. The model data can be entered into the \nvault within the PDM system and the LOCAM generated process plans stored alongside in an \nXML file. Collaboration is possible using the Visualisation services within Windchill. The data \ngenerated by the Expert System, Process Planning and the AP-224 models can all be stored in \nan XML file within the Windchill system. \n \n3 RELATED PROJECTS IN APPLICATION OF PDM IN ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION \n \nThree major projects and a number of smaller projects have been\/are being carried out at \nCranfield University aiming at integrating different enterprise applications through PDM \ntechnologies. The three major projects are briefly described below. \n \n3.1 Teaching Company Scheme with Design Rule \n \nA Teaching Company Scheme (TCS) with Design Rule Ltd. (Ref:3284) aimed to develop a \nknowledge based design system within a PDM system (in this case SmarTeam). The aim is to \nprovide designers with graphical tools which allow designers to implement and manage \nknowledge easily without the need for a 'middle man' (normally an IT specialist). The system \nbreaks down into five main functional categories, i.e., Knowledge Management, Knowledge \nAcquisition, Evaluation of Knowledge, Application of Knowledge and Knowledge Monitor and \nInterface. The system is based almost entirely on Windows\u00ae technologies. The main reason for \nthis is that it allows the use of some of the most up to date and industry standard computer \ntechnologies, including: ActiveX, which is the main method of communication between the various \nmodules on a single machine; COM (Component Object Model), DCOM (Distribute COM) API \n(Application Programming Interface), which allows access to the open architecture of SmarTeam \nmaking it possible to use and control any of the PDM functions. Its is with this COM API open \narchitecture that SmarTeam can carry out all the communications from machine to machine, from \nclient to server, allowing the very best internet transfer technology and giving truly global \nramifications for the Intelligent PDM system. \n \nThe implementation will be completed through three stages. Stage one involves integrating an \ninference engine into the PDM along with a GUI to build, manage and store the knowledge base. \nThe system will allow users to build knowledge bases that directly interact with PDM data objects. \nIt also contributes to the overall goal of the system by forming the initial GUI and the input method \nfor the decision-making logic (see figure 3). Stage two builds on the previous by including \nfunctions that allow users to interact more deeply with the CAD package CATIA. This will allow \nthe developers to have full advantage of the geometric engine and analysis tools, while being \nable to apply the decision making logic of the KBS system and utilize the information stored in the \nPDM database. With this stage complete it will provide the company with a full knowledge based \ndesign solution. Stage three should provide an environment that allows users to model graphically \nthe process they employ when applying their knowledge, including the decision-making logic \nalong with the actions that carry out the tasks. The stage involves implementing a system that can \ninterpret, use and duplicate the code produced for action across a wide variety of applications \nintegrated in the PDM. Once that is done it is a question of creating the action blocks themselves. \nThis will be an ongoing process for the life of the product, but enough basic action blocks should \nbe create at the beginning to allow user to start building knowledge process flows.  \n \n  \nFigure 3: The PDM Object Based Graphical Rule Builder Developed by TCS Project \n \nThe current stage of the project is drawing towards the end of stage one. Users now have the \nability to create rules graphically based on the object definitions (classes) contained within a \nSmarTeam PDM database using simple drag and drop techniques, removing the requirement for \nthe  user to go anywhere near any programming code. The rules can then be uploaded and \nmanaged within SmarTeam from anywhere in the enterprise. The Haley Enterprises rule-based \nserver carries out evaluation of the PDM data based on the uploaded rules using the \ncommunication set up between the two server applications and the users can monitor the results \non client machines using the SmartDesign mini helper. The system offers a new platform for \nusers to create effective KBS applications from simple event notification to a full-blown smart \nproduct configuration system. The PDM base brings life cycle control, enterprise wide distribution \nand easy visibility to all KBS facts and rules. It is in essence effective data management for KBS \non a scale as yet unseen in KBS technologies.  \n \n3.2 EPSRC Project in PDM Based Assembly Planning \nThis project has developed new methodologies for Computer-Aided Assembly Process Planning \n(CAAPP). This was done primarily by the integration of CAAPP functionality with a PDM tool \n(Motiva) providing a data control framework and a high-level data structure to form the basis of \nplanning. This project utilised the Motiva DesignGroup, a mid-range, Windows-based PDM \nsystem to provide a data control framework on which the CAAPP system is based. The \nDesignGroup development kit consists of various ActiveX controls and type libraries that give \ndevelopers access to the majority of the system\u2019s resources. This type of component-based \nintegration provides a quick and effective method of providing engineering software with high \nquality data with as little coding as possible. Integration of CAAPP and PDM provides various \nmethods to simplify the retrieval of relevant data, dramatically cutting down this wasted time.  \n \nMAPS\nCAAPP System\nMotiva DesignGroup\nPDM System:\nProduct Modelling\nData Handling\nDocument Management\nSpatial Technology\nBuildingBlox:\nSolid Modelling\nFeature Extraction\nConstraint Extraction\nLassalle Technology\nAddFlow:\nStructure Modelling\nSequence Rep.\nCLIPS\nExpert System:\nProcess Selection\nFeature Recognition\nVisual Basic:\nIntegration\nObject Modelling\nData\nConfiguration\n \n Figure 4: The Tools Used in the PDM based Assembly Planning System \n  \n As seen in figure 4, the system was implemented in Visual Basic and C, running under the \nWindows NT operating system. Motiva DesignGroup PDM System was used to handle product \ndata and related documents. It interacts with Spatial Technology Building Blox (ACIS) to generate \nsolid models for products and extract feature and constraint information as needed. The Lassalle \nTechnology AddFlow software is used to construct liaison graphs both manually and \nautomatically by the algorithms developed or rules in the CLIPS expert system. In using the \nsystem, an assembly structure is often represented by a simple graph. The system uses this \ntechnique to both display a structure definition and allow interaction with the underlying object-\noriented representation of the assembly. The liaison graph is of a typical form, i.e., a component \nis represented by a circular node and an arc linking two nodes represents a liaison between two \ncomponents. Fasteners are represented by a square node, midway along a rigid arc. The \ndiagramming component AddFlow is used to provide a dynamic method of representing an \nassembly structure. AddFlow provides creation, modification and analysis techniques for various \ntypes of diagram and was found to be an excellent solution to the problem of generating liaison \ngraphs. The assembly structure can be altered through interaction with the liaison graph; adding \n(or deleting) nodes, links and fastener details immediately updates the object-oriented model \nused to represent an assembly. To facilitate rule-based reasoning, the CLIPS expert system is \nembedded in the system. This allows the system to process rule files and retrieve the results.  \nGetting and setting CLIPS variables and controlling expert processes is facilitated by an external \nDynamic Link Library (DLL), containing CLIPS user-defined functions and the code to initialise, \nrun and return results from a knowledge-base. For more details and case studies of this project \nrefer to Gao and Bowland (2002). \n \n3.3 STEP Based Process Planning \n \nThis research project was sponsored by a leading consultant company LSC Group, aiming at the \ndevelopment of a new generation process planning system using the latest tools and \ntechnologies, and to fully comply with STEP AP224 for process planning using machining \nfeatures. Although AP224 has been accepted as an international standard, there is a surprising \nlack of compatible software packages in the market. The developed prototype STEP-enabled \nManufacturing Planning System (SMPS) can generate process plans and associated documents \nfrom AP224 files automatically, without any user interaction. The system consists of decision logic \nstored in an external database that makes it generic and compatible with any manufacturing \napplication. A graphical tool is provided for knowledge capture. The system can also accept a \nfeature tree generated using the Feature Model Editor (FME) which has been developed as an \n\u2018add-on\u2019 to the system. FME is intended to be a tool for conceptual design of simple components, \nand to be integrated with PDM systems. FME feature tree is used in the early design stage while \nthe AP224 file generated from detailed design model is used in the later stages. The prototype \nsystem is intended for single piece machined (prismatic) parts and has been tested with case \nstudies provided by the project collaborators (Sharma 2002). \n \nThe overall flow of the application is shown in figure 5 as a block diagram. The physical disk files \nand applications are clearly marked in the diagram. Each application needs to make a distinct \nboundary between the application itself and the data it uses. In this system, the Data Access \nLayer (DAL) has been compiled as a separate ActiveX Dynamic Link Library (DLL). This DLL \nexposes a single class, which provides the necessary methods and properties for all the bi-\ndirectional data access requirements of the program using standard Sequenced Query Language \n(SQL) calls. Making the appropriate changes to the DAL can easily accommodate any changes to \nthe database schema. If binary compatibility is maintained with the older version, the main system \nusing this DAL needs not be recompiled. All external file access is done using the data access \nlayer.  \n \n  \nThe AP224 viewer\/reader is an application for reading and viewing AP224 files. The application is \ncapable of reading the AP224 file and displaying the solid model as well as displaying the feature \ntree of the component including all the attributes of the features. The feature can also be selected \nfrom the drop-down list in the toolbar. The STEP files are plain ASCII text files. These files are \nread into the viewer and displayed using ST-Developer from StepTools Inc., which is a set of \nComputer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools that reduce the effort required in \nimplementing STEP applications. An important component of ST-Developer is the ROSE C++ \nlibrary. This library makes it possible for application programs to read, write, create, and \nFigure 5: The Information Flow of the STEP Based Process Planning System \nLogic Engine\nLogic Database\nLogic Designer\nAP 224\nSTEP\nFile\nConfiguration Files\/\nROSE Library\nIntermediate\nFile\nPost-processor Resource Manager\nManufacturing\nDatabase\nDocument\nGenerator\/ Viewer\nCrystal Report Tempelates\/\n XML Stylesheets\nOutput Plan\nDatabase\nFINISHED PLAN\n(*.XML)\nDisk File\nProgram\nDatabase\nFINISHED PLAN\n(*.RTF)\nNC Code\nAP224 Viewer\nFME\nPart File\nCLIPS\nmanipulate STEP digital product information. This library has been used to develop the AP224 \nfunctionality of the system.  \n \nThe analytical logic, or more specifically the domain and empirical knowledge, is kept in an \nexternal database. This logic can be edited and viewed graphically as a flowchart using the Logic \nDesigner. The user also has the options of having multiple nested logic flowcharts. The point of \nentry into the logic, or the starting flowchart can be selected\/ configured by the user. This is very \nconvenient in case the same system is to be used for different domains. \n \n \nThe manufacturing database editor allows the user to edit and maintain the resources data and \nother tables in the database. The manufacturing database editor can be accessed as a \nstandalone application or accessed from within the Logic Designer for easier navigation. Various \ntypes of resource tables are provided to hold data such as standard questions, explanation and \nhelp lines, operation macros and standard texts. It is also used to store the CLIPS rules. \n \nThe logic engine is the heart of the system, responsible for actually running the logic stored in the \nlogic database. The logic engine also processes and executes any calls to the CLIPS expert \nsystem. The logic engine uses the functionality of the AP224 viewer\/reader to open AP224 file \nand generate a feature tree of the component in the memory. This feature tree is loaded into an \ninternal memory data structure and can be interrogated by using the appropriate flowchart \ncommands. For example, the developer could write a logic to load a AP 224 feature tree in the \nmemory and then write a recursive loop to interrogate the features one-by-one and process them \ndepending on their attributes. During a planning session, the Logic Engine runs the stored logic, \nretrieves the required data from the database and generates an intermediate file. The \nintermediate file contains macro calls and not the planning details. \n \nThe logic postprocessor outputs a plan database, which is a relational database arranged in a \nhierarchy. Each output plan has a header section and a series of operations. Each operation has \na series of detail lines for that operation. The system is capable of generating the 10 user defined \noutput documents either in Rich Text Format (RTF) files or as Extensible Mark-up Language \n(XML). The format and layout of RTF documents is decided by the report templates. The XML \ndata is formatted for viewing using Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL). Each XSL stylesheet \ndescribes rules for presenting an XML document source. XSL transformations can turn XML into \na grammar and structure suitable for display in a browser and thereby make the output viewable \non any hardware platform. The output in the form of RTF and XML documents offers tremendous \nflexibility in dissemination and annotation of the plans.  \n \n4    CONCLUSIONS \n \nThe described methodologies and software architecture have the potential to integrate enterprise-\nwide applications with new functionality to enable knowledge based concurrent design at the \nconceptual design phase. The unique integration of STEP AP-224 for the generation of \nconceptual designs and analysis of the design with both ERP and manufacturing planning \nsystems enables managers and engineers to make design decisions with more focus on the \nsupply-chain, manufacturing, assembly and cost issues associated with engineering projects. The \nthree related projects described are complementary to this project and the technologies \ndeveloped will be incorporated in the future. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThis paper summarised work carried out in a number of projects sponsored by the Engineering \nand Physical Science Research Council, Department of Trade and Industry, LSC Group and \nDesign Rule Ltd.
