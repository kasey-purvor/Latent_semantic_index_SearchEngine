Yet the unequal effects of privatisation on men and women are ignored. This\narticle argues that, despite considerable variation among countries in the nature of their\nprivate pension schemes, the latter share a failure to incorporate allowances for periods\nof unpaid caring work over the lifecourse. Comparison of the needs-satisfying capacity of\nprivate and public pensions must take account of the situation of those who raise the next\ngeneration of producers and taxpayers.\nI n t roduct ion\nPension privatisation \u2013 shifting the balance of pension provision away from public\nprovision and towards the private sector \u2013 has taken a variety of forms across Europe,\ndepending on dominant societal values and on political feasibility. A recent article in this\njournal (Hyde et al., 2003) has highlighted this diversity and the importance of ideological\norientation in shaping pension reforms. In particular, these authors point out that the neo-\nliberal (or Regulated Market) model of privatisation, exemplified by Britain, has attracted\ncriticism and concern about intensification of poverty among older people, yet is only one\nof several alternative models of pension privatisation. Other models include the Social\nPartners model, expressing a social reformist ideology and the Social Market model,\nexpressing reluctant individualism. These alternative models and orientations towards\npension reform are exemplified by France and Finland respectively.\nHyde et al. (2003) challenge two assumptions they claim underlie the concerns\nof critics: first, that pension privatisation is necessarily informed by neo-liberal, anti-\ncollectivist values, and, second, that an aim of pension privatisation is to reduce the\nwelfare role of the state, to the detriment of the satisfaction of needs. Their analysis is\na useful corrective to a narrowly Anglocentric focus and a plausible case is made that\npension privatisation reforms may be driven by other reasons than anti-collectivism. For\nexample, they suggest that if popular control of welfare through labour or community\norganisations is to be enhanced, this requires some form of privatisation. Although that\nclaim is debatable, it is not the focus of this article. It is the second belief challenged by\nHyde et al. (2003) \u2013 that pension privatisation is driven by the aim of welfare retrenchment\nand that this could erode collective responsibility for the welfare of the vulnerable \u2013 that\nI wish to defend here.\n123\nJay Ginn\nThis article examines how the mix of private and state pensions perform for one\nvulnerable group, women whose family caring commitments result in fragmented em-\nployment patterns and earnings. A framework for evaluating pension schemes in terms\nof their women-friendliness is outlined and European state and private pension systems\ncompared. The remainder of the article considers whether a benign form of pension pri-\nvatisation, in which women and other low paid groups are not disadvantaged, is possible.\nGender, ca r ing and pens ions\nThe caring commitments entailed in motherhood (or in having frail parents) constrain\nwomen\u2019s employment, earnings and ability to contribute to pension schemes in most\ncountries (Ginn et al., 2001; Ginn, 2003) although the impact of caring is greater in some\ncountries than others. Harkness and Waldfogel (1999) show that among women aged\n25\u201344, mothers\u2019 employment participation was substantially less than that of childless\nwomen or of men in five European countries studied \u2013 Germany, France, Sweden, Finland\nand the UK \u2013 but the effect of children was greatest in the UK and negligible in Sweden.\nThis \u2018family gap\u2019 was even more striking for full-time employment. For example, 76 per\ncent of British women without children were employed full time compared with only\n26 per cent of women who had children, while the equivalent rates were 72 and 40 per\ncent in Germany, 75 and 61 in Sweden and 79 and 66 per cent in Finland (Harkness and\nWaldfogel, 1999). For lone mothers (divorced, never married or widows) the problem of\nobtaining affordable childcare is more acute than for married mothers, magnifying the\neffect of motherhood on their employment.\nWhere childcare requirements continue to restrict mothers\u2019 participation in paid\nwork, women\u2019s full-time employment rate cannot be expected to rise substantially.\nMoreover, despite equalities legislation, gender differences in hourly pay, occupational\nstatus and career trajectories persist in the EU. These continuing inequalities limit the\nprospects of gender convergence in the capacity to build independent contributory\npension entitlements.\nWelfare states both construct and reward particular uses of time through the rules of\npublic pension schemes (Schiewe, 1994) and this is also the case for private pensions.\nPension entitlements are maximised by continuous full-time employment throughout\nthe years from 20 to 65 and may also depend on the individual\u2019s earnings trajectory\nover the working life. The extent of women\u2019s disadvantage in acquiring pensions varies\nconsiderably among European pension systems, as discussed in the next section.\nA gender -sens i t i ve approach to pens ion sys tems\nAnalysis and debate about pension systems has predominantly focused on state\/market\nrelations, while gender and family roles have been relatively neglected (Orloff, 1993).\nThus Hyde et al. (2003) argue that the neo-liberal model of private pensions is only one\nmodel and that others exemplified in Europe are less market oriented and hence allow\nmore scope for expressing the values of social cohesion, integration and inclusion. Yet\nthese authors\u2019 otherwise useful analysis does not consider whether pension privatisation\nwill exacerbate women\u2019s pension disadvantage irrespective of societal values and the\nparticular reform model adopted.\n124\nEuropean Pension Privatisation\nTable 1 Key components of pension systems from a gender perspective\n(a) State pensions (individual entitlement)\nAccess Earnings or hours thresholds for contributions\nYears threshold for residence-based pension\nThe treatment of years of caring\nAge for pension qualification\nAmount Whether and how pensions are linked to earnings\nThe existence of minimum floors and\/or ceilings\nMaximum amount as % of average earnings\nDuration of contribution\/residence period for full pension\n(b) State pensions (entitlements as dependant)\nAccess Married or widowed status required for eligibility\nProvision for pension splitting on divorce\nAmount Whether dependant\u2019s entitlement equals that of contributing spouse\n% allocated to wife, if unequal entitlement\n% \u2018inherited\u2019 by widow\nArrangements for divorcees\n(c) Private pensions\nAccess Private pension provision mandatory or not\nEarnings or duration of service threshold for eligibility\nEase of transfer or preservation for early leavers\nAmount Defined contribution or defined benefit\nLevel of employer\u2019s mandatory contribution, if any\nWhether entitlement is inflation-proofed during preservation\nWhether pension in payment is inflation-proofed\nLevel of tax relief on contributions, if any\nWidow\u2019s pension as % of deceased member\u2019s pension\nSource: Ginn et al., 2001, chapter 1.\nA gender-sensitive analysis of pension systems examines how the rules privilege\nparticular forms of time use. The tighter the link between pension entitlements and\nemployment career the stronger will be the gender differences in pension entitlements.\nRedistributive mechanisms that loosen the link between past earnings and pension\nentitlements tend to benefit women, especially those whose caring commitments have\nreduced their contribution record (Rake, 1999). In the pension system as a whole, the\nrelative shares of state and private pensions are also important.\nTable 1 sets out the key features of a pension system in terms of pension quality for\nwomen, distinguishing four sources of income in later life (Ginn et al., 2001). Gender-\nrelevant aspects of state and private pensions for the individual and of derived pensions\nare next examined. Public and private pensions are then considered in terms of how well\nthey meet the needs of those who have taken on caring commitments.\nSta te pens ions ( i nd i v i dua l en t i t l emen t )\nIn state pension provision, minimum or flat-rate pensions and those based on best earning\nyears all help women to obtain an independent pension, as does recognition of care work\n125\nJay Ginn\nTable 2 Allowances for childcare or eldercare in state pension schemes\n(a) Flat rate schemes\nBritain Home Responsibilities Protection for those\nwith children up to 16 (or 18 in full-time\neducation) and for those providing substantial\ncare for adults\nIreland Homemakers Scheme as above\nDenmark Universal tax-funded Social Pension\n(residence-based)\nNetherlands Universal pension (residence-based)\n(b) Earnings related schemes\nFinland Coverage for recipients of home care\nallowance\nSweden 4 years coverage for each child\nAustria 4 years coverage for each child\nGermany 3 years coverage for each child, based on\nnational average earnings; informal carers\ncovered, benefit depending on hours of\ncare provided\nFrance 2 years coverage for each child; bonus for\nmothers of 3 children\nBelgium 2 years coverage for each child, based on\nindividual\u2019s last wage\nPortugal 2 years coverage for each child\nLuxembourg 2 years coverage for each child\nSpain 1 year coverage for each child\nItaly 6 months coverage for each child;\n1 month\/year coverage for informal carers\nGreece 3\u20136 months coverage for each child\nDenmark (ATP) None, but pension related to hours\nnot earnings\nBritain (SERPS\/State Second Pension) None in SERPS but its replacement from\n2002, the State Second Pension, includes\ncoverage until the youngest child is aged 6\nSource: Adapted from Leitner, 2001, Tables 4 and 5.\nfor entitlement purposes. Most EU state pension schemes make some form of allowance\nfor years of caring for children \u2013 and some also allow for informal care of frail adults \u2013\nas shown by Leitner (2001) (see Table 2). Two of the flat rate schemes (Britain and\nIreland) have since the 1970s provided for those with caring responsibilities by reducing\nthe number of qualifying years required for a full basic pension. In Denmark and the\nNetherlands, a tax-funded \u2018citizen\u2019s pension\u2019 is payable to all those fulfilling residence\nrequirements, at age 67 in Denmark and 65 in the Netherlands. Thus those who have spent\nyears providing care receive the same basic pension as those who have been continuously\nemployed. In 2002 the Dutch universal flat rate pensions provided \u20ac203 (about \u00a3140)\nper week to each lone pensioner plus a holiday allowance, and the pension is indexed\nto the minimum wage. In stark contrast, the full British basic pension in 2002 was only\n\u00a377 per week (about 15 per cent of average earnings) undermining its effectiveness\n126\nEuropean Pension Privatisation\nas an instrument to redistribute towards carers. This large difference in the generosity\nand comprehensiveness of the Dutch and British basic pensions, where both countries\nhave a large private pensions sector, is likely to reflect their different orientations to\nwelfare.\nIn earnings related pension schemes, the value of a carer\u2019s credit depends on the\nnotional contribution rate applied for the period covered, which may be a fraction of\nnational average earnings or of the individual\u2019s recent earnings. Another gender-relevant\nfactor in earnings related schemes is the number of years used in calculating the average\nearnings on which the pension entitlement is based (Leitner, 2001). Half of the EU\ncountries with an earnings related scheme use lifetime earnings (Belgium, Germany,\nItaly, Luxembourg, Sweden, Britain); in these countries periods of no\/low pay will tend\nto reduce the average on which the pension is based, unless those periods are entirely\ncovered by pension credits. The remainder use average earnings during last or later years\n(Finland, Greece, Spain) or the average in the best years (Austria, France, Portugal). Since\nwomen\u2019s earnings are not necessarily highest towards the end of the working life (as is\noften the case for men, especially in non-manual occupations) use of best years is more\nhelpful to women than use of last years.\nIn sum, most state pension schemes in the EU include some provision to compensate\nfor women\u2019s disadvantages arising from their interrupted and part-time participation in\nthe labour market, although the redistribution in favour of carers varies widely across the\nEU. Despite a relatively generous system of crediting carers into state pensions, Britain\nstands out as having particularly low levels of state pensions. This reflects an increasingly\nstrong neo-liberal welfare orientation since the 1970s that has also expanded reliance on\nprivate pension provision.\nPr i va te pens ions (occupa t i ona l and ind i v i dua l )\nMembership of defined benefit occupational pensions is often unequally available to\nemployees. Women\u2019s lower coverage relative to men reflects this, as well as their lower\nemployment rate. In Britain, women have had less access to such schemes due to\nshorter hours of work, lower occupational status, shorter length of service and type of\nemployer; part-timers often work for small private sector employers who do not operate an\noccupational pension scheme (Ginn and Arber, 1993). Moreover, part-timers and others\non low wages (mainly women) often cannot afford the higher contributions required in\nan employer\u2019s pension scheme (Fawcett\/Age Concern, 2003). For all these reasons, the\nbenefit of the employer\u2019s contribution, which has generally ensured a better pension than\nthat offered by individually arranged pension plans, is less available to women than men.\nAmong employees who join a defined benefit occupational pension scheme, women are\nmore likely than men to leave early due to caring commitments, losing the benefit of later\nwage growth. Even where women and men employees have similar coverage by such\npension schemes (as in British public sector organisations) their lower earnings, shorter\nhours of work and gaps in employment all result in lower pension entitlements relative to\nmen, mediated by class and ethnicity (Ginn, 2003).\nIndividual (or personal) pensions may be more widely accessible to workers, yet\nprovide poor value for most women and for the low paid generally (Davies and Ward,\n1992; Waine, 1995). As in any defined contribution scheme, contributions made early\nin the working life have a disproportionate effect on the fund at retirement but women\u2019s\n127\nJay Ginn\nability to contribute is often very limited until their children have become independent.\nCharges for administration, investment management and annuitization may reduce the\nvalue of contributions by 45 per cent (Murthi et al., 2001). It is estimated that 30\u201340 per\ncent of personal pension account holders in Britain found that charges actually exceeded\nthe amount they had contributed (Disney and Johnson, 1997). British stakeholder pensions\nhave charges capped at 1 per cent of the fund annually. Yet by retirement such charges may\nhave reduced the fund by 25 per cent, while hidden charges (such as dealing costs) can\nabsorb as much again. For the low or moderately paid, the loss due to charges combined\nwith low annuity rates and the risk of poor investment performance, make personal\npensions an expensive gamble. Women not only retire with a smaller accumulated fund\nthan men but due to longer average life expectancy their annuity will be about 10 per\ncent lower than for men with the same fund \u2013 a double disadvantage.\nWomen not only have less financial resources to gamble with than men but are also\nmore likely to feel uninformed about pensions (Hawkes and Garman, 1995). Across a\nrange of OECD countries, women receive much less income from private pensions than\nmen do, as shown later in this article.\nDer i ved pens ions ( s t a t e and p r i va t e )\nWomen\u2019s retirement income is influenced by their marital status, since pension schemes\nhave traditionally provided spousal and survivors\u2019 pensions. But these fractional pensions\nbased on a husband\u2019s contribution record are often inadequate, especially where the\nhusband\u2019s own pension is small. In the twenty-first century, changing expectations\nconcerning women\u2019s financial independence make derived pensions an unsatisfactory\nremedy for women\u2019s poorer independent pension entitlements. Moreover, derived\npensions are becoming increasingly ineffective and ill-targeted, due to erosion of the\nlink between marriage and motherhood.\nThroughout developed societies, fertility is falling, as the expectation that women\nwill bear and raise children as a matter of course has weakened. In Britain, a quarter of\nwomen born in 1972 are predicted to be still childless by age 45, compared with only\n11 per cent of women born in 1943 (FPSC, 2000). Equally, the expectation that men\nand women will marry has declined. Thus the proportion of British women aged 18\u201349\nwho were married fell from three quarters in 1979 to only half in 2001, while those who\nwere single (never married) doubled from 18 per cent to over a third and those who were\ndivorced\/separated nearly doubled from 7 to 13 per cent (ONS, 2002). The proportion of\nmothers who are married has also fallen. In 2001, only two thirds of women aged 16\u201359\nwith dependent children were married (ONS, 2002). Births outside marriage rose from\n7 per cent in the early 1970s to 38 per cent in 1998 (ONS, 1999). Lone parent families\n(90 per cent headed by women) represent a quarter of all families (ONS, 2000a). The\ndecline of marriage as a lifelong contract makes reliance on a husband for income in later\nlife an increasingly risky strategy for women.\nThese social changes surrounding marriage and motherhood raise questions for EU\npolicymakers about the wisdom of relying on marriage and derived pensions (public or\nprivate) to support older women. Spouse and survivor state pensions provide no help to\nthose who have raised children outside marriage so that such women fall through the\nnet. Derived pensions involve substantial cross-subsidies from other contributors to those\nwho marry, but apply irrespective of caring commitments (Cuvillier, 1979; Jepsen and\n128\nEuropean Pension Privatisation\nTable 3 Women\u2019s pension income relative to men\u2019s, in six\nOECD countries: non-married women and men aged over 70,\nmid-1990s\nWomen\u2019s mean amount as % of men\u2019s\nPublic Private Total\nBritain 92 40 69\nUS 90 54 78\nGermany 77 74 77\nFrance \u223c \u223c 74\nFinland \u223c \u223c 75\nSweden 75 62 73\nDenmark 100 91 99\nNotes:\nBritain: State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) included with\n\u2018private\u2019.\nUS: Supplemental Security Income (SSI) included with \u2018public\u2019.\nGermany: Public officials\u2019 pensions included as \u2018public\u2019.\nDenmark: Public officials\u2019 pensions included as \u2018public\u2019, also means-\ntested supplement.\n\u223c The major pension schemes were not separated into public and\nprivate.\nSource: Calculated from Makinen (2002), Figure 4.2.\nMeulders, 2002). Thus non-married mothers, a group suffering multiple disadvantages,\nsubsidise the derived pensions of childless married women. Similarly in defined benefit\noccupational pension schemes there are cross-subsidies from members who are not\nmarried \u2013 including lone parents \u2013 to members who are married since the latter pay\nno additional contribution into the scheme in respect of survivor benefits.\nIt is questionable whether this subsidy to marriage in state pensions and final salary\noccupational pension schemes is justifiable. But derived pensions cannot be phased\nout until there is improved pension protection for those with caring commitments. That\nimplies improving state pensions, as shown in the next section.\nPub l i c\u2013pr i va te pens ions mix : e f fec ts on gender inequa l i t y and pover ty\nPersonal income of married individuals is rarely analysed, due to the assumption of equal\nsharing within couples, although research has shown that gender inequality of later life\nincome is greatest among those who are married (Ginn and Arber, 1991, 1999). Among\nnon-married older people, such information on gender differences in income is more\nreadily available. Makinen (2002) used Luxembourg Income Study data for the mid 1990s\nto compare non-married individuals\u2019 pension income in ten countries. Among those\naged over 70, women\u2019s average pension income as a proportion of men\u2019s was lowest \u2013\n69 per cent \u2013 in Britain, between 73 and 78 per cent in the US, Germany, France, Finland\nand Sweden, but nearly 100 per cent in Denmark (Table 3, column 3). In Britain and\nthe US, where private pensions are relatively important, women\u2019s state pension income\n129\nJay Ginn\nwas over 90 per cent of men\u2019s but the gender gap was much wider in private pension\nincome. Thus British non-married women aged over 70 received only 40 per cent of the\nprivate pension income of their male counterparts. In Germany and Sweden, the gender\ngap in state pension income was quite large, reflecting the earnings related structure of\nthe social insurance scheme. In France and Finland, information distinguishing private\nand state pension income was not available. A high degree of gender equality of later\nlife income is seen in Denmark, due mainly to the redistributive effect of the citizen\u2019s\npension.\nGender inequality in private pension income varied across countries, being greatest in\nBritain and least in Denmark. While this appears to support Hyde et al.\u2019s (2003) contention\nthat the model of privatisation matters, differences in women\u2019s full-time employment\nrates and in the gender earnings gap contributed to these outcomes. Moreover,\nwhere a relatively small proportion of retired men and women have private pension\nincome, these represent an occupational elite, in which women have predominantly\npursued a career at the expense of raising a family. Among non-married women aged\nover 70, private pensions comprised on average under 2 per cent of their total income\nin Germany and 9 per cent in Denmark. In contrast, the equivalent figures for Sweden,\nBritain and the US were 15, 26 and 23 per cent respectively (Makinen, 2002: Figure 4.2).\nTable 3 demonstrates the potential for state pensions to equalize incomes between women\nand men, indicating that a shift towards the private sector can be expected to reinforce\ngender inequality.\nThe public\u2013private mix in pension provisions has implications for pensioner poverty.\nThe poverty rate for individuals aged over 65 in 1998, using the EU definition of income\nbelow 60 per cent of national median equivalized income, was 21 per cent in Britain\n(25 per cent for women, 17 per cent for men), compared with 11 per cent in Germany,\n8 per cent in Sweden and 7 per cent in the Netherlands (CEC, 2003). Relative to the\nincome of the average production worker, state pensions of non-married women aged\nover 65 were only 20 per cent in Britain, 25 per cent in the US, around 30 per cent in\nCanada, Italy and the Netherlands and over 40 per cent in Germany and Finland (Yamada\nand Casey, 2002: Table 5.5). The high poverty rates and low relative incomes of older\nwomen in the highly privatised systems of Britain and the US suggest a relationship with\npension privatisation. But can we conclude that privatisation per se causes these adverse\ndistributional outcomes?\nBen ign pens ion pr i va t i sa t ion \u2013 an un l i ke l y scenar io\nSince a neo-liberal ideological orientation to welfare leads to both low state provision\nand a well-developed private sector, it is difficult to disentangle causal relationships. The\nquestion raised by Hyde et al.\u2019s (2003) article is: Can pension privatisation in the context of\na relatively collectivist ideological climate avoid the intensification of pensioner poverty,\nespecially among women? There are reasons to believe it cannot.\nFirst, private pensions have public costs. For example, public spending on private\npensions, mainly tax relief, grew dramatically under the Thatcher administration, reaching\n\u00a38.2bn in 1991 and \u00a313.7bn in 2000. This was equivalent to over 40 per cent of state\nspending on the basic National Insurance pension (Sinfield, 2000) and amounted to\n2.8 per cent of GDP (Adema, 2000). Moreover, the private pensions industry absorbs\na substantial proportion of the public subsidy in management charges, especially in\n130\nEuropean Pension Privatisation\nindividually arranged pensions, as noted above. The public resources available to pay\nstate pensions, on which women and the low paid depend heavily, are thus reduced.\nSubsidies to private pensions are highly regressive, with half the benefit received by the\ntop 10 per cent of taxpayers and a quarter by the top 2.5 per cent (Agulnik and Le Grand,\n1998).\nSecond, as private pensions spread first among the most secure and well-organised\nemployees, a powerful constituency is established which will defend tax reliefs and\nother subsidies to private pensions but which is less motivated to defend declining state\npensions. This process can be traced in Britain, where occupational pensions initially\nnegotiated by organised workers as a fringe benefit developed into a lucrative industry\nthat limited the scope for a state second tier pension (Shragge, 1984). Despite the belated\nintroduction of the women-friendly State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) by a\nLabour government in the 1970s, along with enhanced indexing and carer allowances\nin the basic pension, these improvements to state pensions were short-lived. Resistance\nby organised workers was insufficient to prevent the cuts imposed by the Conservative\ngovernments in the 1980s, at a time when the new personal pensions were being promoted\nwith attractive financial incentives. From the point of view of the individual employee\nexpecting a substantial private pension, state pensions may seem increasingly irrelevant,\nreducing willingness to pay contributions or join others in defending state pensions. This\nBritish scenario contrasts with the massive and effective resistance to government attempts\nto cut state pensions organised over this period by trade unions in Italy, Germany and\nFrance, where the majority of employees rely on state (or quasi-state) pensions. Privatising\npensions may itself alter the ideological and political context, eroding social solidarity\neven where this is not an intended consequence.\nThird, the transition costs of privatising pensions fall on the generation that is working\nat the time. Paying for both the existing state pension liabilities and their own funded\nprivate pensions, they bear an unfair share of the transition cost. A corollary is that pressure\nbuilds to reduce state pension contributions and hence the level of state pensions. The\nissue of what pension structure can best achieve intergenerational equity in an ageing\npopulation has been thoroughly explored by Schokkaert and van Parijs (2003). Applying\nthe ethical principle that the ratio of pensioner incomes to those of workers should remain\nconstant across generations \u2013 the Musgrave (1986) rule \u2013 these authors conclude that fair\nsharing of the cost of population ageing and risk of economic shocks among generations\ncannot be achieved by private funded pensions. Defined contribution pensions \u2018are\nintrinsically unable to achieve intergenerational risk sharing\u2019 (Schokkaert and van Parijs,\n2003: 254) while occupational defined benefit schemes allow greater sharing of market\nrisks but cannot maintain intergenerational equity if they have an ageing membership.\nThese authors add that some pre-funding of Bismarckian state pensions may be required\nand they recommend a basic non-means tested universal minimum pension to ensure\nintra-generational redistribution and to reduce gender inequality in pension income.\nFourth, as shown by Toporowski (2000) large pension funds have large economic\neffects, fuelling stock market inflation, share price \u2018bubbles\u2019 and a crisis in private pension\nfunding. Company pension schemes in Britain are increasingly closing to new members\nand offering defined contribution schemes instead, reducing the employer contribution at\nthe same time so that projected pensions are often 30 per cent lower than in the original\nscheme. Some employers have wound up their scheme, with serious losses for workers\nwhose expected pension has shrunk to a tiny fraction of its previous level. The British\n131\nJay Ginn\nAssociation of Consulting Actuaries estimated that only two fifths of British occupational\nfinal salary pension schemes remain open to new members, with half of these considering\nclosure (ACA, 2002). Private pensions are as much affected by increasing longevity\nas are state Pay-As-You-Go pensions, but have the additional risk of poor investment\nperformance. The collapse of Equitable Life\u2019s pension guarantees after 1999 and the\nimplosion of Enron in the US in 2002 demonstrated the limits of state regulation of private\npensions, even after repeated scandals, investigations and attempts to tighten controls.\nMoreover, a pensions industry that initially cooperates with social partners may grow\nlater into a powerful political actor in defence of its own interests. In Britain, a spate of\ngovernment consultations has revealed the effectiveness of the private pensions industry\nin influencing pensions policy and resisting state regulation. The risks of market failure,\nincompetence and fraud in private pensions are not confined to neo-liberal welfare states\nbut have wider relevance.\nFifth, the explicit aim of most OECD governments is to contain state pension spending,\nirrespective of differences in their traditional ideological orientations. The promotion of\nprivate pensions must be seen as part of this objective, a means of allowing (some)\nindividuals to compensate for diminishing state pensions. Those who cannot do so, mainly\nwomen, manual workers and ethnic minorities, will face the indignities of means testing\nor the uncertainties of relying on family members for financial support. Benign pension\nprivatisation, without intensification of poverty among the vulnerable, seems unlikely to\noccur.\nConc lus ions\nThis article has taken issue with the view that pension privatisation need not be to the\ndetriment of social cohesiveness and the needs of the vulnerable, showing how women,\nin particular, are disadvantaged in private pensions. Comparing state and private pensions\nfrom a gender perspective showed that the former are better able to reduce the adverse\neffects of caring on women\u2019s pension income.\nAlthough countries beginning to introduce private pensions appear to avoid the\nworst consequences of privatisation evident in countries with a neo-liberal orientation to\nwelfare, it is suggested that if the share of private pensions grows, new political alliances\ncould form based on a more individualistic ethos. In such a climate, defence of state\npensions could weaken, leading to an increase in pensioner poverty and inequality.\nAcknowledgments\nI am grateful to the Sociology Department of Surrey University for financial support\nenabling me to write this paper.\nRefe rences\nACA (2002), ACA Survey of Final Salary Schemes, www.aca.org.uk\/public content\/June 2002 ACA\nSURVEY OF FINAL SALARY SCHEMES.doc.\nAdema,W.
