Since the advent of the World-Wide Web, online role-plays\nhave become widely used in Australian tertiary institutions endeavouring to provide\nstudents with authentic learning opportunities (Brown, Collins, and Duguid 1989). It\nis argued in the education literature that through the performance of roles, students are\nable to appreciate a multitude of perspectives on real-world scenarios (Herrington and\nOliver 1995). However, work in the area of social studies of technology and sociology\nasks us to look at the experience of reality and role-play through a different prism. The\nresearch reported in this article uses models drawn from social theory and sociotech-\nnical theory to examine a series of related research questions, including how students\nbecome engaged with identities, how identities are mediated, and the extent to which\nroles in these role-plays are shaped by the system, the scenario, and the agency of the\nactors themselves. It does this through an in-depth analysis of an online role-play\nknown as The Campaign, developed at The University of Melbourne. This analysis\n*Email: m.riddle@latrobe.edu.au\n64  M.D. Riddle\nsuggests the usual argument for the use of online role-plays on the basis that they are\nauthentic learning environments, should be carefully reconsidered. It discusses the\neffects of surveillance in an online system on the performance of roles and suggests\nlimitations in the situationist perspective in accounting for the self-constitution of\nidentity through role-play.\nAuthentic learning\nA central argument used to support the use of role-play environments in tertiary\neducation is that they provide access for students to the world of doing and acting\ninstead of simply receiving instruction through reading and listening. The idea that\nstudents should participate in their own learning through a form of practice has been\nmainstream in educational theory for a long time, yet it is still commonplace for\ntertiary courses to be taught through the heritage method of lectures and seminars.\nWhere methods such as role-play are used, therefore, the argument is that students will\nbe more fully engaged through practice in an authentic learning environment.\nBrown, Collins, and Duguid (1989) suggest that the activity and context in which\nlearning takes place are generally regarded as ancillary, distinct, and neutral with\nrespect to what is learned. They argue that this common assumption is clearly\nincorrect, drawing on Vygotsky\u2019s (1978) theory that knowledge is fundamentally\nsocial in nature. Cognitive skills are, they contend, the products of social interactions\nwithin an individual\u2019s environment rather than being innate. Learning and acting are\ntherefore not to be thought of as somehow distinct functions. There is a life-long\nprocess of learning how to act.\nThis situationist approach to learning contends that individuals learn from the\nenvironment within which they find themselves. Learning is situated and therefore we\nshould focus on providing rich, active learning environments rather than dull and inert\nclassrooms. Furthermore, learners tend to pick up cultural behaviours and gradually\nstart to act within the norms of that culture through observing and practicing in situ.\nThe problem, according to these authors, is that schools use classroom tools such as\ndictionaries and formulae in a different way from practitioners, so students can do well\nwhen assessed but may not be able to use a chosen domain\u2019s conceptual tools in\npractice. They therefore define authentic learning activities as \u2018ordinary practices of\nthe culture\u2019 (Brown, Collins, and Duguid 1989, 36).\nOnline educational role-plays\nRole-play is a relatively common teaching practice, particularly in primary and\nsecondary school settings. Traditional role-play activities involve students enacting\nsome kind of story for the purposes of gaining a more complete understanding of a\nconcept or issue. Milroy (1982, 41) argues for the validity of role-play as a learning\ntechnique because it is an \u2018opportunity for discovering more about human behav-\niour and for acquiring the kind of information that will help people cope more\neffectively with their own relationships\u2019. Freiberg (1996) advocates the use of\nimprovisation strategies such as role-play for the purpose of involving students\nmore actively in their learning, encouraging collaboration among students, improv-\ning the development of shared meanings, and linking varied curriculum areas\ntogether. Role-plays are, Freiberg says, a safe way of \u2018making learning real\u2019\n(Freiberg 1996, 337).\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   65\nDespite not being widespread prior to the existence of the World-Wide Web,\nonline role-plays were being used in higher education in Australia as early as 1992.\nVincent describes an email role-play used for teaching political science students about\nthe Middle East peace process during this time (Swart 1992). Students took on the\nroles of important public figures involved in a fictional scenario based on events in the\nMiddle East. Students from the University of Melbourne were linked up with students\nin Texas studying the same issues. The exercise culminated in a telephone conference\nbetween the two student cohorts in which the students dressed as their characters.\nThe development of the Middle East role-play simulation (Vincent and Shepherd\n1998) led to a series of others at the University of Melbourne, including DRALE\nOnline (Riddle and Davies 1998) and The Campaign (Hirst, Riddle, and Young 2005),\nand influenced other online role-play developers in Australia (Kinder, Fardon, and\nYasmeen 1999). Describing a learning design architecture that follows on from\nVincent and Shepherd\u2019s (1998) work, Ip, Linser and Naidu (2001) emphasise the\nfacility of role-play simulations in the acquisition of practical skills, as well as their\nability to provide a context for those skills through the use of goal-based scenarios\n(see also Ip and Morrison 2001).\nPerformance, identity and actor networks\nAn investigation of online role-plays that attempt to allow students to see themselves\nas professionals calls into view a number of important theoretical considerations. The\nconcepts of performance and identity and how they relate to one another are of partic-\nular interest to the discussion. It is useful in this context to recall the work of Althusser\n(1977), who posits a theory about how individuals (actors and their roles) are defined\nand reflected by ideological structures in the world around them. Althusser (1977,\n160) coins the term interpellation to mean the process by which individuals are\nrecruited and transformed into subjects. He gives the example of a police officer who\nhails a pedestrian by calling \u2018Hey, you there!\u2019. The individual instantly recognises that\nthey are the subject who is being hailed, and in that moment recognises and declares\nhim or herself as a subject. Indeed, Althusser says, we are \u2018always and already\u2019 inter-\npellated (or hailed) as subjects by ideology.\nGoffman\u2019s (1959) performative self-constitution thesis contends that we develop\nour sense of self by performing roles in life. In order to perform a role successfully,\nwe must make our audience believe our performance. The performer may or may not\nbelieve their own performance. Sometimes the act begins as a cynical exercise and\nends with self-belief, according to this theory, and sometimes this sequence is in\nreverse. Goffman (1959, 32) uses the term front for the \u2018expressive equipment of a\nstandard kind intentionally or unwittingly employed by the individual during his\nperformance.\u2019 The front is not limited to linguistic practices, and includes a setting (an\noffice, for example) and a personal front comprising the appearance and manner of\nthe performer. Clothing, physical characteristics, speech patterns, and gestures are all\nimportant parts of the performance.\nWhen considering the way that individuals and technology interact in relation to\nconcepts of identity, the topic of power must also be examined. Actor network theory\n(ANT) argues that social theories must take into account the special nature of humans\nand their relationship with technology. Thus \u2018every human interaction is sociotechni-\ncal\u2019 (Latour 1994, 806). ANT does away with the distinction between human subjects\nand non-human objects in order to investigate the way that humans and non-humans\n66  M.D. Riddle\nare actors linked through numerous sociotechnical associations (Latour 1994, 804). It\nshould be noted that this notion of agency is contested by the work of authors such as\nPickering (1995, 9\u201320) and Ihde (1990, 26).\nOnline networks arguably provide a new mechanism for surveillance over\nstudents. Foucault (1984) provides a useful and provocative model for thinking\nabout the effect of surveillance on individuals. He argues that it is through the\nconstruction of a hierarchical apparatus for observation that individuals are subju-\ngated and redefined, citing examples such as the design and layout of military camps\nthat allow every action of the soldiers to be seen (Foucault 1984, 189). This slightly\ndarker view and its effect on the way that individuals interact within online\neducation systems must be taken into account. For example, Foucault argues that\neducational examinations use techniques of observation together with techniques to\nnormalise judgement in order to qualify, classify, and punish (Foucault 1984, 197).\nOnline systems provide new opportunities to capture and observe interactions in a\nmore comprehensive way.\nThe Campaign\nThe Campaign was conceived as a role-play scenario by Dr Sally Young at The\nUniversity of Melbourne in the winter of 2003. It is designed to enable an online role-\nplay between political advisers and journalists covering an election campaign, and\nculminating in a \u2018live\u2019 press conference. Students would be divided into teams of\nAdvisors and Journalists and paired up with a member of the opposite team. The\nsystem simulates the final four weeks of an election campaign over eight weeks\u2019 time,\nwith content specific to each week of the campaign being time-released at two-week\nintervals. Students log on as either a Journalist or an Adviser, with Tutors logging in\nfrom a Tutor\u2019s page. The student role-play participants see documents that pertain\nonly to their role, and can create new documents such as articles and press releases to\nbe saved in a Work Folio or sent to another role-play participant. A To Do list shows\na series of tasks to be completed during one week of the campaign, and a \u2018place-\nmarker\u2019 function displays the current week\u2019s To Do list. At various stages throughout\nthe role-play, the To Do list links to media clips, including audio and video material\ncreated specifically for the simulation. The scenario was designed to include some\nsurprise events that would be introduced primarily through the use of these media\nclips and leading to ethical dilemmas.\nThe Campaign was first used in Semester 2, 2004 and again in Semester 2, 2005.\nThe system was designed for the most part to simulate a political campaign as expe-\nrienced by a Journalist or Adviser as closely as possible. However, it included certain\nfeatures that replicate university educational processes, such as instructions to the\nstudents, a discussion area, and a process for submitting documents for assessment. The\nonline system described above thus represents a hybridised partial replication of two\nexisting social systems: a political campaign and the traditional university education\nsystem.\nThere are many ways in which the behaviour of participants in The Campaign can\nbe interpreted as they established their roles. The purpose of this study is to examine\nthe ways in which students become engaged with one or more identities, and in partic-\nular with their vocational identity. The paper focuses on how the online nature of\nthe role-play affects this engagement including how students get into role and the\ninfluence of surveillance. Poster (2001) applies Althusser\u2019s (1977) concept of\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   67\ninterpellation to online communications, and the interpretation of the communications\nwithin The Campaign will follow and extend this path.\nMethodology\nThe Campaign was used in a postgraduate Media and Communications program at the\nUniversity of Melbourne. Students enrolled in Strategic Political Communication in\nthe second semester of 2005 were approached to be involved in the study. All partic-\nipants were briefed and signed a consent form. The project received approval from the\nuniversity\u2019s Human Ethics Committee.\nPrimary data included classroom observations, online communications using The\nCampaign Mail Tray and email, semi-structured interviews with five self-nominated\nstudents and technical and educational design documents from The Campaign and\nother similar online role-plays. Student pairs as Journalist\/Advisor were: James\/Thea,\nKirsten\/Noni*, Frida\/John, Yvette\/Heather*, Brian\/Xuan*, Guido\/Stacey*, Graham*\/\nJosie (pseudonyms are used, and asterisks indicate those who were interviewed).\nInterviews were transcribed in full and the resulting transcripts, along with selected\nextracts from the students\u2019 communications and extracts from the design documents\nfor the system were then analysed. This methodology drew upon grounded theory\ncoding techniques in social science described by Strauss (1990), Neuman (2003) and\nSeale and Kelly (1998). These data were then interpreted using theoretical construc-\ntions of actors, subjects, identities, roles and performances, drawn from social theory\nand sociotechnical studies.\nResults and discussion\nGetting into the role\nParticipants were asked how they went about getting into their role, including what\nthey had been told in class, what they learnt by consulting the system, and what they\ndrew from their own experience. Three of the students interviewed felt they lacked a\ngood understanding about the role they were going to play, and indicated some uncer-\ntainty about their approach. Noni chose her role as an Adviser because she felt she\nalready knew what would be expected of a Journalist and preferred to explore a more\nunfamiliar role. Xuan said he had a feeling of \u2018panic\u2019 when confronted by the\nchallenges of his role, and Heather felt the expectations of acting in the role of Adviser\nwere \u2018huge\u2019. All of these students referred to relying on their own research (guided by\na reading list in the system) and what they could learn from reading documents that\nwere provided to them during the exercise.\nAdvisers were given access to a set of electronic documents specific to their role\nincluding a Letter of Offer of Employment, a Staff Card, and various messages from\ntheir Candidate intended to direct their attention to the tasks expected of them in their\nrole. Journalists received equivalent documents and directions from their Editor.\nThese documents provide a kind of character profile for the role and an outline of the\nrole-play scenario. Students who identified themselves as less confident tended to use\na pattern of studying documents, engaging in set tasks, and then contacting their\npartnered student by email or at face-to-face meetings. While they sometimes met\nface-to-face with other students to negotiate the nature of their roles in the role-play,\nthey also used the online communication as a way to take their time and test out the\n68  M.D. Riddle\nway they should interact in role. Students who were more confident had an under-\nstanding of some of this detail, so sometimes reported spending less time reading\nbackground material. Yet they all still spent time and effort researching their roles,\nsometimes asking experts to whom they had privileged access.\nGraham signed off his messages as \u2018Political Correspondent\u2019 above the title of the\nfictitious newspaper The New Times, which was typical of students engaging in online\ncommunications within the System. Almost all of the students tended to use a friendly\nand professional tone in their initial contact in The Campaign. As soon as this initial\ncontact was made, Graham\u2019s messages began to assume a more informal tone,\nalthough he continued to use his title and employer at the end of his messages. There\nis no doubt that building a good working relationship was high on the agenda, because\nGraham referred to the dependence of Journalists on the Advisers to feed them content\nduring the role-play. Graham perceived that the Advisers were really in control of the\nway that the role-play played out. Most of the students interviewed felt that Journalists\nwere somewhat dependent on Advisers in this way. Thus, the role-play is establishing\na sub-text of power distributions at the same time as asking students to go through the\npragmatic or instrumental requirements of the role.\nGraham interpellates Josie as an Adviser through the use of careful linguistic prac-\ntices he associates with being a Journalist. He, in turn, is interpellated as a Journalist\nthrough his communications with her. Both are also interpellated by the system\nthrough the presentation of role-specific documents and cues. These features are to be\nexpected of a role-playing system built around the concept of authentic learning. It is\nclear that these characteristics are successful in signifying something to the students,\nreferring to a complicated set of social meanings, and that these meanings are then\npassed on. Althusser (1977, 170) argues that the mechanisms defining roles that\nindividuals play in society are the means by which the social structure are reproduced,\nusing vocational training as an example. The analysis of the design of, and communi-\ncations within, these online role-plays reveals the particular linguistic techniques\nthrough which this mechanism is realised. At the same time these social meanings\nengage the students in their vocational identity, they reproduce themselves.\nGoing off the radar\nPart of the role of the system was to monitor what students did. All discussions were\nrecorded, and everything the students did in the system was logged. Foucault\u2019s (1984)\nideas about observation and its effects on individuals come into play here. By analysing\nthe effect of surveillance, we can get a clearer picture of the way the sociotechnical\nnetwork mediates the identities of the role-play participants.\nThe relevance of this question to the particular roles students chose to perform and\nthe way they went about performing them was made apparent somewhat by chance,\ndue to a minor technical problem that emerged with the system. Student-to-student\ncommunications, handled by a function called the Mail Tray, sometimes failed. As\nthis was crucial to the way that the role-play was conducted, students found other\nways to contact each other, most of the time using private email. An analysis of some\nof the communications that students engaged in when they were outside of the system\nreveals that they almost always contacted each other as students, while inside The\nCampaign system they were almost always in character as Journalists and Advisers.\nWhen asked about how and why they did this, students were quite forthcoming.\nStacey commented that the layout of the pages and menus in the system made it clear\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   69\nthat this was an \u2018Adviser space\u2019, saying, \u2018the very act of logging on emphasises that,\nas it demands a very clear and conscious act of entering a gate\u2019. She added that she\nhad the feeling that the lecturer could assess their communications in the system, and\nthat it was a public, class space rather than one for private interaction between indi-\nviduals. Thus the system interpellated students in a complex way. While on the radar,\nin order to play their role as Student in a conscientious way, they must play the role\nas Journalist or Adviser. Outside the system, the student may act as a student without\nthe added layer involved when playing the assigned role. Despite this, the process of\ncontacting each other in private outside the system involved some interesting negoti-\nations in terms of how in-role the interactions would become. Figure 1 illustrates this\nusing one of the first email messages Stacey sent to her Journalist partner Guido\nduring the role-play.\nFigure 1. Email extract from adviser student Stacey to journalist Guido.Reflecting on this email, Stacey commented that it was particularly interesting\nbecause it was more in her role as an Adviser than later messages: \nI was actually being Adviser me in that one. That message was sussing out how far \u2018in\nrole\u2019 he was prepared to be, i.e. whether he was prepared to play the game outside the\nsystem. I quickly concluded he was not, though, so it just became chit chat between\npeople in a class together, talking about our adviser and journo selves in third person\n(and with a certain amount of disapproval, I think you will find!). (Stacey, email, 26\nFebruary 2006)\nTheir comments reveal that the students were still driven by their tasks but either did\nnot feel the need to keep up their assigned roles when communicating in a more\nprivate online setting, or alternatively, felt the need to reassert their roles as Friends\nand fellow Students when they could. While \u201coff the radar\u201d, they would typically send\na short informal note in the body of an email message while sending a more formal\ndocument in their Journalist or Adviser role as an attachment. Thus, while the system\naffords the movement in and out of roles by interpellating the actors involved, it also\nFigure 1.

According to his theory of the presentation of self, when two parties\nor teams interact, they tend to stay within character. That is, they maintain the line that\nis acceptable to all parties present. However, at moments of crisis, or when the audience\nis no longer present, they may engage in backstage familiarity. Performances backstage\ncan include \u2018mock role-playing and uncomplimentary terms of reference\u2019, and are\ncommonly characterised by derogation of the audience and what Goffman calls staging\ntalk: discussion and analysis of aspects of the staging.\nIn the case of The Campaign, communications of a collusive nature between\nJournalists and Advisers that may be unacceptable inside the System are possible in\nemail. The expressive equipment (or front) for Journalists and Advisers can be used\ninside the System and dropped outside of it. The purpose of their email communica-\ntions is obviously to set up a commonality, not between Journalist and Adviser, but\nbetween student and student. In establishing this solidarity, Guido and Stacey can be\nseen to be setting up another front that is acceptable to them. It is not a matter of drop-\nping an artificial front to reveal a reality \u2013 it is the change of audience that determines\nthe need for a new front to be established. In other words, when they are off the radar,\nclassmates interpellate each other as classmates. Goffman\u2019s thesis is that it is through\npresenting ourselves in different ways that we construct the self. It is my contention\nthat online role-plays such as The Campaign provide the means for another front\nthrough which the self can be performed. The Campaign interpellates Guido and\nStacey in the less familiar roles of Journalist or Adviser in order to make these roles\nmore familiar, but it does not prevent them from interpellating each other in other\nways as well. Cynical performance is at one end of a spectrum for Goffman, with\nbeing taking in by one\u2019s own act at the other (Goffman 1959, 30). If we accept that\nwe perform ourselves in everyday life, it cannot be said that Guido and Stacey are\nreally students who are performing as Journalist and Adviser when they also perform\nthemselves as students.\nConclusion\nThis discussion has argued that theoretical models drawn from social theory and\nsociotechnical studies provide a new way to view online educational role-plays.\nAlthough online role-plays are clearly useful for learning, they are not as authentic\nas they are usually portrayed; particularly in so much as the nature of authenticity\nitself is problematic when considering identity. Too often the literature treats authen-\nticity and identity as straightforward and unproblematic. Certain aspects of online\nrole-plays that are unreal can be seen to enhance the ability of students to take on\nnew roles and learn new professional skills. This suggests that future work may\ninvolve a reconsideration of the application of the theory of authentic learning to\nonline role-plays with regard to epistemology, and further application of theories of\nperformative self-constitution. Educational theories based on situated cognition\n(Brown, Collins, and Duguid 1989) suggest that role-plays work because they place\nlearners within realistic situations in which they must act. However, following the\ntheory of performative self-constitution, we might reinterpret the situation as the\nsetting. We must include the personal front of the actor in any comprehensive\ndescription of the learning process through online role-plays.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   71\nA limitation of authentic learning that emerges from this view is its lack of an\naccount of the appearance and manner \u2013 in other words, the individual\u2019s expressive\nequipment, including those elements that are conscious and those that are not. The\ntheory of authentic learning focuses on an account of how social interactions with the\nreal world enhance learning, however by doing so the importance of these aspects of\nthe individual are downplayed. In addition, by considering that situational learning\nmay have more to do with providing learners with a setting that enables them to self-\nconstitute their roles and interpellate others, the importance of authenticity is thrown\ninto question. One advantage of this is that we may be relieved of the burden of\nproving that a learning environment is actually authentic.\nThis analysis also suggests that current educational theory on online role-plays\ndepends on a contested view of epistemology because it is often based on a conception\nof the learning process as being about acquiring knowledge through interacting with\nan objective reality.\nAcknowledgements\nThe work in this article is an adaptation of a thesis submitted for my MA, entitled The\nroles actors perform: Role-play and reality in a higher education context, available online\nat: http:\/\/eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au\/archive\/00002885\/.
