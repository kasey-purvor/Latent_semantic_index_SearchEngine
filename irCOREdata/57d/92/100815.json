INTRODUCTION\nIt is well known that the pairing correlations between\nnucleons in a nucleus are extremely important in the region\nof low angular momentum where they manifest themselves\nby reducing the nuclear moment of inertia with respect to the\nrigid-body estimates @1#. However, as the rotational fre-\nquency of the nucleus is increased, the resulting Coriolis and\ncentrifugal forces tend to reduce the pairing correlations, an\neffect which has been extensively studied @2#. A decrease in\nthe correlations is also expected for multiquasiparticle con-\nfigurations because the unpaired nucleons block the single-\nparticle states into which pairs of nucleons can scatter. These\neffects had not been studied extensively partly due to the\nlack of appropriate experimental data. Such data @3\u20139# are\nnow becoming available around the mass 180 region, allow-\ning the investigation @10# of pairing as a function of senior-\nity.\nNuclei near A;180 are particularly favorable candidates\nfor studying the influence of many broken pairs of nucleons\n~at low rotational frequency! on pairing. In this region the\nproton and neutron Fermi levels are among orbitals with\nlarge values of V , the projection of angular momentum on\nthe nuclear symmetry axis, so that high-K multiquasiparticle\nstates compete favorably with collective rotational excita-\ntions to form the yrast line. Spectroscopic investigations\nhave identified many such states @11\u201316#, but experimental\ndata for high seniority states had been fragmentary, mainly\nbecause their angular momenta are often close to the maxi-\n*Present address: Department of Physics, University of Surrey,\nGuildford, UK.\n\u2020Present address: Physics Division, Argonne National Laboratory,\nArgonne, IL 60439.\n\u2021 Present address: Nuclear Science Division, Lawrence Berkeley\nNational Laboratory, 1 Cyclotron Road, MS-88, Berkeley, CA\n94720.0556-2813\/2000\/61~4!\/044321~33!\/$15.00 61 0443mum attainable from the available reactions.\nThe nucleus 177Ta can be favorably populated up to spins\n>20\\ using the reaction 170Er(11B,4n) allowing access to\nthe region where high-K multiquasiparticle states might exist\n@17#. Early @18\u201323# and more recent @24,25# studies of 177Ta\nwere reported by other groups, resulting in the identification\nof 1-quasiparticle bands and some of the 3-quasiparticle\nstates and their associated bands. Our work, first reported in\nRef. @4#, is the only one which is sensitive to the identifica-\ntion of intrinsic states at higher spins due to the angular\nmomentum input and the technique of time-correlated g-ray\nspectroscopy employed in the measurements. It reveals the\npresence of one 1-quasiparticle, three 3-quasiparticle, five\n5-quasiparticle and three 7-quasiparticle states in addition to\nthe intrinsic states known from earlier investigations. Some\nof the new states are isomeric. Selected results, pertaining\nmainly to the yrast isomers, have been published earlier @4#\ntogether with some results for 176Ta and a comparison with\ncalculations of the multiquasiparticle states. The present pa-\nper addresses the complete level scheme involving intrinsic\nstates and associated rotational bands, and compares the re-\nsults with more recent calculations which supersede those of\nour earlier work.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD\nStates in 177Ta were populated by the reaction\n170Er(11B,4n)177Ta with a 55 MeV beam from the 14UD\npelletron accelerator at the Australian National University.\nAn isotopically enriched 170Er target of thickness\n5.5 mg cm22 was used, which stopped most of the recoiling\nnuclei. A series of measurements was performed, focusing\non different aspects of the spectroscopy, as discussed in the\nfollowing subsections.\nA. g-g coincidence measurements\nA pulsed beam ~;1 ns wide pulses, 1.7 ms apart! was\nused for this set of measurements. The g rays were detected\u00a92000 The American Physical Society21-1\nM. DASGUPTA et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 61 044321using the CAESAR array @26# containing six Compton-\nsuppressed high-purity germanium ~HPGe! detectors. An un-\nsuppressed planar germanium detector ~LEPS! was included\nto give enhanced efficiency and resolution for g-ray transi-\ntions between ;15 and 100 keV. The energies of each two-\nfold coincidence ~encompassing time differences of up to\n60.856 ms) were recorded event-by-event, together with\nthe time of each energy signal relative to the beam bunches,\nallowing unambiguous identification of g-ray transitions pre-\nceding or following an isomer.\nB. g-ray singles measurement\nGamma rays were measured in singles mode under the\nexperimental conditions described in Sec. II A. These data\nwere used in part to determine relative intensities and popu-\nlations of the different bands. The anisotropies were deter-\nmined from the prompt-gated g-ray spectra, encompassing\ntime differences up to 640 ns with respect to the beam to\nminimize relaxation effects due to isomers.\nC. Beam-g measurements\nThe possible existence of isomers in the microsecond re-\ngion was investigated using a chopped beam of 2 ms pulses,\nseparated by 103 ms and the experimental setup described in\nSec. II A. The energies of g rays were recorded event-by-\nevent, together with the time of each energy signal relative to\nthe beam pulses. A fast veto was used to remove g rays\noccurring in the 2 ms in-beam period, to increase the sensi-\ntivity to the g rays following an isomer.\nD. Conversion electron measurements\nA separate experiment was performed to measure conver-\nsion coefficients, using a superconducting solenoidal spec-\ntrometer @27#. A relatively thin target of thickness\n1.5 mg\/cm2 placed at 30\u00b0 with respect to the beam was used\nto optimize the electron energy resolution. Since the pres-\nence of isomers with lifetimes in two distinctly different time\nregions ~nanosecond and millisecond! had been established,\nthe beam on\/off periods were adjusted to cover two time\nregimes; 1 ns on ~bunched!, 900 ns off; and 80 ms on,\n720 ms off. The spectrometer field was swept over a range\nof magnetic fields such that electrons of energies between\n115 and 2145 keV for the former run, and 70 and 680 keV\nfor the latter, were optimally transported to a cooled Si~Li!\ndetector. During the latter measurement a veto was used to\nreject the prompt events. The g rays were detected using a\nCompton-suppressed HPGe detector. Conversion electrons\nand g rays were recorded in event-by-event mode with their\ntimes relative to the beam bursts.\nIII. ANALYSIS PROCEDURE\nA. g-g coincidences\nThe data were sorted, following energy gain and time\nmatching, into 409634096 channel matrices with the fol-\nlowing constraints on the g-g coincidence relationship: ~i! a\nrequirement that two g rays occur within 640 ns of each04432other; ~ii! a less stringent condition where the time relation-\nship was relaxed to 6150 ns in order to include low-energy\ng rays which suffer from time walk in the detectors; ~iii! a\ncondition that two g rays occur within 640 ns of each other\nand also during beam bursts; ~iv! the complementary case\nwhere both g rays are required to occur between beam\nbursts, thus selecting coincidence events below an isomer;\n~v! where the g events are required to occur between beam\nbursts with the additional condition that they be separated in\ntime between 80 and 300 ns; this matrix then allows for two\nevent-projection types\u2014~a! projection of those events that\nprecede an isomer by gating on transitions that follow it; and\n~b! projections of those events that follow an isomer by gat-\ning on transitions that feed it; ~vi! the same as the previous\ncondition, with the required time difference between g\nevents being from 300 ns to 1.52 ms. Again, one can obtain\ntwo types of projections as detailed above. In this case the\nsensitivity to longer lived isomers is enhanced compared to\nsort ~v!. Background subtracted coincidence spectra were\ngenerated, for each individual g-ray transition, from these\nmatrices and were examined to construct the level scheme.\nB. g-g time\nIn order to isolate the lifetimes of individual states, the\ncoincidence data were also sorted into three-dimensional\ng1-g2-time matrices. For states depopulating by low-energy\ng rays a separate matrix was constructed with any of the six\nHPGe detectors (g1) against the LEPS detector (g2). The\ntime relationship between pairs of g rays could be obtained\nfrom such matrices by taking background subtracted g-ray\ngates on transitions preceding and following any state.\nC. g time\nTwo-dimensional matrices were generated of g-ray en-\nergy vs their time of arrival with respect to the beam, using\nthe data taken during the experiments described in Sec. II.\nMatrices were constructed corresponding to the different\nbeam on\/off periods: ~a! 1 ns on, 900 ns off, ~b! 2 ms on,\n103 ms off, and ~c! 80 ms on, 720 ms off; facilitating the\nmeasurement of the short-lived and the long-lived states. A\nseparate g-time matrix was constructed using the data re-\ncorded in the LEPS detector to determine the lifetimes of the\nstates which are relatively short lived ~meanlife ,1 ms),\nand decay by low-energy g rays.\nD. Conversion electrons\nThe data from the experiment discussed in Sec. II D were\nused to construct two-dimensional matrices of electron en-\nergy or g-ray energy against the time of arrival with respect\nto the beam pulse. Prior to construction of the matrices, the\nelectron events were subjected to momentum selection crite-\nria @27# to eliminate background events arising mainly due to\nbackscattering of electrons from the detector. Projections\nfrom the g time and electron-time matrices were used to\nassemble electron and g-ray spectra in specific time regions,\nselected to improve the sensitivity to specific decay paths,\ne.g., long-lived or short-lived isomer decay.

Coincidence g-ray spectrum relating\nto the Kp5 172 1 band ~see Fig. 2!. The spectrum\nis generated by gating on the 935.9 keV transition\nwhich depopulates the Kp5 172 1 level, and pro-\njecting all g rays within a time interval of\n6150 ns.3!. This work also extends the rotational sequence built on\nthe previously known states, the Kp5 212 2, 232 1, 252 1 at\n1355.0, 1698.5, and 2098.2 keV, respectively ~all in Fig. 3!.\nThe present measurement, confirms the Kp5 172 1 band-\nhead at 1522.9 keV ~Fig. 2! identified by Archer et al. @25#\nas Kp5( 172 1), but it disagrees with their assignment of the\nfirst member of the rotational band as being at 1656.2 keV.\nIn the present work it is assigned to be at 1605.4 keV with a\ndecay to the Kp5 172 1 bandhead by a 82.5 keV transition.\nThis transition is clearly visible in Fig. 8 which shows the\ncoincidences with the 935.9 keV transition depopulating the\nbandhead. The out-of-band transitions ~see Fig. 5! from the\nIp5 292 1 level at 2570 keV to the Kp5 72 1 band and the\ndecay of the Kp5 312 1 isomer to the Ip5 272 1 and 292 1 mem-\nbers of the Kp5 172 1 band further supports our energy and\nspin assignments. ~The transition may have been missed in\nRef. @25# because of their insensitivity to low-energy transi-\ntions.!\nMost of the 3-quasiparticle states ultimately decay ~Fig.\n3! to the 212 2 isomeric state at 1355 keV. Figure 9 shows the\nevents that precede its decay. This spectrum is generated by\ngating on the 311.3 keV transition ~which depopulates the\nisomer! and the 171.6, 195.3, and 218.1 keV transitions of\nthe 92 2@514# band ~which is fed by the isomer!, with an\nappropriate time gate. The spectrum corresponds mainly to\nthe portion of the level scheme in Fig. 3, though the g rays\npreceding the Kp5 312 1 isomer ~Fig. 4!, including the main\ndecay route of the Kp5 492 2 isomer, can also be seen clearly.\nThe strongest g rays are associated with the Kp5 232 1 band\nabove the 1698.5 keV level, which lies in the main decay\nroute of the Kp5 312 1 isomer.\n3. 5- and 7-quasiparticle bands\nThe 5-quasiparticle, Kp5( 292 )1 state at 2671.1 keV ~Fig.\n3!, Kp5 312 1, 332 2, and 352 1 isomeric states at 2826.4,\n2852.6, and 2956.8 keV, respectively ~Fig. 4! and the Kp\n5( 372 )2 state at 3287.0 keV have been identified in this\nwork. Also identified are the three 7-quasiparticle states at\n4329.4, 4570.2, and 4656.3 keV labeled Kp5 432 1, 452 2, 492 2,\nrespectively, in Fig. 4. These states are weakly populated as\nthey are close to the maximum input angular momentum\nbrought in by the reaction.044321Figure 10 shows transitions occurring between beam\nbursts, which de-excite the Kp5 492 2 isomer. This out-of-\nbeam coincidence spectrum is generated by gating on the\n240.8 and 461.5 keV transitions below the isomer, with the\nadditional condition that the coincident g rays should occur\nwithin 640 ns of each other. This constraint reduces the\nintensity of the g rays following the Kp5 332 2 isomer in the\nspectrum ~and incidentally reduces the efficiency below\n;70 keV). The weak 502 and 935.9 keV g rays in the\nspectrum are due to the decay branch of the Kp5 312 1 isomer\nto the Kp5 172 1 band ~see Fig. 5! which subsequently decays\nmainly to the 92 2@514# band.

Transition intensities and angular distributions\nThe relative intensities of the g-ray transitions given in\nTable I are normalized to the intensity of the 147 keV tran-\nsition in the 92 2@514# band, which is arbitrarily taken to be\n1000 units. Due to the complexity of the spectrum, many of\nthe transition intensities are obtained from either across-\nisomer projections or from prompt-coincidence projections.\nWhile angular correlation effects in the former are expected\nto be minimal, they may significantly affect the intensities\nobtained from the latter. The intensities obtained solely from\nthe prompt coincidence data are indicated in Table I and\nhave not been corrected for angular correlation effects which\nare estimated to be ,15%.\nThe prompt gated g-ray spectra recorded in singles ~see\nSec. II B! at 648\u00b0, 697\u00b0, and 6145\u00b0 were analyzed to\nobtain the angular distribution information. Due to the lim-\nited number of angles in the array, only the A0 and A2 coef-\nficients could be extracted, with the A4 term set at zero. The\nfitted A2 values are given in Table I and are discussed for the\nparticular transitions in Sec. V C.\nD. Electron conversion coefficients and multipolarities\nThe electron conversion coefficients are given in Table II.\nTotal electron-conversion coefficients were obtained from\nthe g-g coincidence spectra by determining the balance of\nthe transition intensities feeding and depopulating a given\nstate. The K-, L-, and M-conversion coefficients were deter-044321mined from the conversion electron measurements as de-\ntailed in Sec. III D.

Level lifetimes\nTime spectra for each individual transition generated from\nthe g-time and g-g-time matrices ~see Secs. III B and III C!\nwere used to determine the meanlives of the intrinsic states.\nThe accuracy to which short lifetimes can be measured de-\npends critically on the measurement of the time response as\na function of the g-ray energy for one detector in the case of\ng-time measurements and for two detectors for the g-g-time\nmeasurements @28#. The response functions for the g-time\nmeasurements were obtained by fitting the time spectra of\nprompt g rays using a single Gaussian. For the g-g-time\nmeasurements, the response functions for pairs of transitions\nwere obtained by fitting the time difference spectra for a\nnumber of pairs of prompt g rays in a cascade whose ener-\ngies lie in the neighborhood of the g rays of interest. The\npositions and widths of the Gaussians obtained from the fit-\nting procedure were parametrized and used for subsequent\nanalyses. For very short lifetimes (,5 ns), instead of using\nthe universal fit parameters, response functions determined\nfrom prompt g rays with energies close to the line of interest\nwere used.\nIn determining the lifetimes from g-time measurements\nonly those lines which were free of contaminants were used,\nwhile in the case of g-g-time measurements, contaminants-14\nCOMPETITION BETWEEN HIGH-K STATES AND . . .

These are discussed in relation to in-\ndividual bands in the following subsections.\nC. Characterization of bands\nThe individual intrinsic states and their rotational struc-\ntures are discussed in this section. The bands based on the\n1355.0 keV level with Kp5 212 2 and the 1874.9 keV level\nwith Kp5( 212 )2 mix, and are discussed separately in Sec.\nVI.\n1. 72\u00bf[404] band (Figs. 1 and 5)\nThe Kp5 72 1 band has been extended to Ip5 452 1. The\nprevious assignment of a 72 1@404# Nilsson configuration is\nconsistent with the experimental gK value of 0.75~4! which is\nin reasonable agreement with the theoretical estimate of\n0.62. This band lies in the decay route of the Kp5 172 1 and\nKp5 312 1 isomeric states ~Fig. 5!.\n2. 12\u00bf[541] band (Fig. 1)\nThe a51 12 decoupled sequence, assigned to this con-\nfiguration, was observed up to Ip5 452 2. The 12 2 and 32 2\nlevels and the 92 2\u2192 52 2 transition, proposed by earlier works\n@36,37# have been included in the level scheme. The rota-\ntional band members of the a52 12 sequence were identified\nup to ( 352 2), and both the DI51 and DI52 crossover tran-\nsitions to the a51 12 sequence have been observed up to\nIp5( 312 2). In-band transitions are weak for this sequence\nwith a preference for out-of-band decays to the a51 12 se-\nquence. The large alignment of ;3.5\\ units for the a5\n1 12 sequence is consistent with its h9\/2 proton configuration.\nThe meanlife of the Ip5 52 2 state, the lowest state in the\n1\n2\n2@541# band, is measured to be 5.360.2 ms in the present\nwork, which agrees well with the previously compiled value\n@23# of 5.260.3 ms.\n3. 52\u00bf[402] band (Fig. 1)\nThe Kp5 52 1 band was observed up to Ip5 332 1 and ten-\ntatively up to 352 1 and the results of the present work agree\nwell with those of Ref. @25#, except for the 312 1\u2192 292 1 tran-\nsition energy which was assigned as 324 keV in Ref. @25#,\ncompared with our assignment of 321 keV. This band, being\nfurthest from the yrast line among the 1-quasiparticle bands,\nis weakly populated compared to the others. The experimen-\ntal gK value of 1.67~6! is consistent with the configuration\nassignment. The meanlife of the bandhead is determined to\nbe 10063 ns and agrees well with the previously compiled\nvalue of 10567 ns @23#.\n4. 92\u00c0[514] band (Fig. 1)\nThis band is observed up to 392 2, where it seems to be\napproaching a band crossing. The assignment of the higher\nmembers of the band (Ip. 312 2) differ from those of Ref.\n@25#. The present work assigns the 352 2\u2192 312 2, 372 2\u2192 332 2\ntransitions as 651.0 and 667.7 keV, respectively ~these are044321weak but clearly seen in Fig. 7!, while in Ref. @25# the\nequivalent transitions are given as 666 and 677 keV, respec-\ntively. In their publication @25# the spectrum with a 316 keV\ngate shows a g ray at 677 keV but the 666 keV line is not\nvisible. However, the dipole transition between the Ip\n5 312\n2 and 332 2 levels is clearly visible in that spectrum and\none would therefore expect to see the 666 keV line with\ncomparable intensity. The absence of the 666 keV line in the\n316 keV gate indicates that it unlikely to be in the band. The\npresent work shows that while a 315.9 keV transition is\npresent in the 92 2 band, there is also a 316.6 keV transition in\nthe 232 1 band ~see Figs. 1 and 3! which could account for the\n677 keV line in the coincidence spectrum in Ref. @25#.\nBeing near yrast, this band is populated very strongly and\nall observed 3-quasiparticle states decay through it ~see Figs.\n2, 3!. The value of gK51.20(4) agrees well with the theo-\nretical prediction of 1.30 for the 92 2@514# configuration. The\nbandhead meanlife was measured to be 592610 ns which\nagrees with the previously compiled value @23# of 534\n672 ns, within the experimental uncertainty.\n5. Ip\u02dc( 112 \u00c0) state at 899 keV (Fig. 2)\nA possible intrinsic state situated at 899 keV ~Fig. 2! and\nits first three rotational members have been identified. The\nupper limit for the meanlife of this state is 1 ns. The band-\nhead decays to the 92 2@514# and the 72 1@404# bands and the\n( 132 2) level decays to the 112 2 member of the 92 2@514# band.\nThe positive A2 coefficient for the 679 keV transition, from\nthe ( 112 2) level at 899 keV to the 112 2 member of the\n9\n2\n2@514# band, suggests spins of 92 , 112 , 132 , or 152 . The 92\nassignment is ruled out due to various decay branches to the\nKp5 92 2 band and transitions from the Kp5 192 1 band ~see\nFig. 2!. The existence of the 826 keV transition from the\n( 112 2) level to the Kp5 92 2 bandhead rules out the 152 assign-\nment, leaving spins of either 112 or 132 . A value of A2\n5 \u20130.15(16) for the 826 keV transition suggests that the spin\nis likely to be 112 and the presence of the 769 keV transition\nto the 92 1 level of the 72 1@404# band argues against a 132 2\nalternative. The fact that higher members of the band are not\npopulated could also be an indication of the lower spin value.\nIn view of these arguments, the spin of the 899 keV level has\nbeen assigned tentatively as ( 112 ), although the 132 possibility\ncannot be ruled out completely. The ( 152 2) and ( 172 2) mem-\nbers of the band are fed by 363.4 and 334.6 keV transitions\nfrom the 192 2 and 212 2 members of the Kp5 192 2 band.

DASGUPTA et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 61 0443216. Kp\u02dc( 172 ) state at 1476 keV (Fig. 2)\nA level at 1476 keV which decays to the Kp5 92 2 band\nhas been identified, and possibly the next higher member of\nthe band, but no others. The 1476 keV state seems to be fed\nby several weak branches. The intensity ratio of 2:1 for the\n889.0 to the 1084.0 keV depopulating transitions makes it\nunlikely that transitions are E1 in nature, for which the ex-\npected ratio is around 1:2. This argues against 152 1 or 132 1 for\nthe bandhead. The absence of a significant lifetime and the\npresence of the 1084 keV transition to the 132 2 state, makes\n17\n2\n1 unfavorable. Further, there is no low-energy 152 2 state\nwhich can be constructed from the available Nilsson orbitals,\nleaving the possibility of 132 2 or 172 2. If the state is K5 132 ,\nthen a 132 2\u2192 112 2 transition is expected to compete favorably\nwith the 889 keV transition. In the absence of this transition,\nthe state is assigned a tentative spin of I5( 172 ). It is likely\nthat the intrinsic state is associated with the 3-quasiparticle\nNilsson configuration of @n2$ 12 2@521# , 72 2@514#%\n^ p1$ 92\n2@514#%]17\/22 and is not populated strongly since its\nband cannot compete favorably with the neighboring Kp\n5 172\n1 and 192 2 3-quasiparticle bands ~see Secs. V C 7 and\nV C 8!, both of which have high alignments.\n7. Kp\u02dc 172 \u00bf band at 1522.9 keV (Figs. 2 and 5)\nA rotational band, extending up to Ip5 372 1, based on a\nKp5 172 1 state at 1522.9 keV has been identified. This state\nwas also identified in Ref. @25#, but as discussed in Sec.\nIV B 2, their assignment of the Ip5 192 1 state is incorrect.\nThe bandhead has a meanlife of 862 ns and decays to the\n5\n2\n1\n,\n7\n2\n1\n,\n9\n2\n2\n, and ( 112 2) bands, with the decay to the Kp\n5 92\n2 band being the strongest. E1 multipolarity is assigned\nto the 718.0 and 935.9 keV depopulating transitions to the\nKp5 92 2 band from the conversion coefficients ~Table II!.\nThe 479.5 and 935.9 keV transitions have a negative A2\ncoefficient. On the basis of the above observations, a spin\nand parity of Kp5 172 1 has been assigned to the bandhead.\nThe relative intensities of the depopulating transitions are\nconsistent with the spin and parity assignment. As shown in\nFig. 5, there is chance near degeneracy of the 292 1 level and\n31\n2\n1 levels of this band with those of the Kp5 72 1 band and\nKp5 312 1 isomer, respectively. This gives rise to mixing and\nresults in out-of-band transitions from the 172 1 band to the\n7\n2\n1 band, and decay branches from the Kp5 312 1 isomer.\nThough there is some evidence for the corresponding out-of-\nband transition (Eg5481 keV) from the 292 1 level of the\nKp5 72 1 band to the 252 1 level of the 172 1 band, low statistics\nprevents it from being conclusive. The presence of these\ntransitions, induced by mixing, lends further support to the\nspin and parity of the Ip5 272 1 and 292 1 rotational states, and\nhence of the bandhead.\nThe high alignment of the band, shown in Fig.\n15~a!, indicates the presence of a particle in an aligned or-\nbital. The likely Nilsson configurations for the bandhead\nare p3$ 72\n1@404# , 92 2@514# , 12 2@541#% or n2$ 12 2@521# ,\n7\n2\n1@633#% ^ p1$ 92 2@514#%. The gK estimates using a simple\nNilsson model give 0.99 and 0.62 for these two configura-044321tions, respectively, and the experimental gK50.61(4) favors\nthe latter. However, as shown in Fig. 17, the predicted gK\nvalues for both configurations change when the experimental\nalignments are taken into account ~see Sec. V A!. The ex-\nperimental values are not exactly reproduced by either of the\nFIG. 15. As for Fig. 14 but for the 3-quasiparticle bands in 177Ta\n~see Fig. 20 for the band on the 1874.9 keV state!.

Same as Fig. 14 but for the 5- and 7-quasiparticle\nstructures in 177Ta.-22\nCOMPETITION BETWEEN HIGH-K STATES AND . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 61 044321predictions, but an increase in the gR value of 0.1 ~i.e., gR\n50.39) makes the experimental points coincide with the pre-\ndictions for p3 configuration. Such an increase could occur\nas a result of reduced proton pairing in the 3-quasiproton\nconfiguration due to blocking effects. The slow rise in gK as\nseen experimentally is also in accord with the p3 structure.\nThus, even though the identification of the structure is am-\nbiguous, the experimental evidence would seem to favor the\np3 configuration. The calculations of Kondev et al. @6#\nwhich examined the energies of the two configurations for a\nrange of tantalum nuclei show that the p3 configuration is\nenergetically favored for 177Ta, thus lending further support\nfor that configuration.\n8. Kp\u02dc 192 \u00c0 level at 1602.7 keV (Fig. 2)\nA 192 2 state and its rotational band extending up to 352 2\nand tentatively up to 372 2, has been identified. The bandhead,\nand the lower members of the band decay to the Kp5 92 2 and\nthe ( 112 2) bands. The 797.8 keV transition from the band-\nhead to the 172 2 member of the Kp5 92 2 band is determined\nto be M1 in character from the measured conversion coeffi-\ncient ~Table II!, and has a negative A2 coefficient, indicating\nthat the spin of the level is either 152 2 or 192 2. The 152 2\npossibility is unlikely given the reasonably strong population\nof the band. Consistent with this is the observation that the\nintensity of the 1016 keV depopulating transition to a 152 2\nstate of the Kp5 92 2 band is much less than that of the 797.8\nkeV transition indicating that 1016 keV is not an M1 but\nprobably an E2 transition.

However, the lower spin states which can be con-\nstructed from the available orbitals are expected to be ener-\ngetically unfavored compared with a 192 2 intrinsic state,\ntherefore the 192 2 level has been assumed to be the bandhead.\nThe high alignment of the band, shown in Fig. 15~b!, is\nonly consistent with the configurations: n2$ 72 1@633# ,\n7\n2\n2@514#% ^ p1$ 52 1@402#% or n2$ 52 1@642# , 72 2@514#%\n^ p1$ 72\n1@404#% with gK values of 0.42 and 0.26, respec-\ntively, which with the inclusion of alignment effects give\nvalues of 0.61\u20130.59 and 0.48\u20130.45 over the spin range of 232\nto 272 . The experimental gK value of 0.38~4! does not match\nwith the expectations of either of the configurations ~Fig.\n17!, although it appears to favor the latter which is, however,\nexpected to be energetically unfavored.\nThe reason for this discrepancy could be due to mixing,\nmost likely with the band based on the 212 2 state at 1355.0\nkeV, as could be inferred from Fig. 18. Such mixing could\nchange the in-band properties of both the bands as indeed is\nseen in the case of 212 2 band ~see Sec. VI C!, which shows an\nunexpectedly rapid increase in alignment @Fig. 15~b!#. There\nis also a chance near degeneracy of the 192 2 and 92 2 bands at\nspin 352 , leading to mixing of the two bands at higher spins as\nis apparent from Fig. 18.

Kp\u02dc 232 \u00bf state at 1698.5 keV (Fig. 3)\nThis state and its rotational levels up to the 312 1 state were\nknown from previous work @21#. However, in the present\nstudy the 1834.6 keV level is assigned as the 252 1 member of\nthe band, contrary to the previous assignment @21# of it being\na Kp5 252 1 intrinsic state with the higher levels being the\nrotational band built on it. Observation of the 338.7 keV E2\ntransition connecting the 272 1 to 232 1 level, and the gK2gR\nvalues deduced from the intensities of the transitions de-\npopulating the Ip5 272 1 state supports our assignment. The\nrotational sequence extends up to Ip5 432 1 and tentatively up\nto ( 472 1). The band head de-excites by a 343.5 keV transition\nto the Kp5 212 2 state at 1355 keV. The 343.5 keV transition\nis assigned E1 character from the measured electron conver-\nsion coefficient ~Table II!. A value of A2520.25(4) for the\n343.5 keV transition, combined with the E1 nature, fixes the\nspin and parity of the level as 232 1. The Ip5 252 1 rotational\nmember has a strong in-band transition and it also decays to\nthe Kp5 232 2 state at 1625.9 keV by a 208.8 keV transition.\nThe E1 nature of this transition deduced from the total con-\nversion coefficient ~Table II! further supports the spin and\nparity assignment. This band is on the main decay route of\nthe Kp5 312 1 isomer, the ( 292 )1 level and the Kp5 252 1 band\n~Fig. 3!.\nThe band alignment shown in Fig. 15~a! is consistent with\nthe presence of an i13\/2 neutron. The likely Nilsson configu-\nrations are listed in Table V. The experimental gK value of\n0.58~4! value favors the n2$ 72 1@633# , 72 2@514#%\n^ p1$ 92\n2@514#% configuration, and agrees very well with the\nexpectations when alignment effects are included ~see Fig.\n17!. The first transition in the band has a low energy caused\nprobably by strong Coriolis mixing with members of the\nKp5 252 1 band obtained by replacing the 72 1@633# neutron\nby a 92 1@624# neutron, which will lower all states except the\n23\n2\n1 bandhead. The compressed first rotational transition is\nalso observed @9,42# in 178W for the Kp572 band, which is\nrelated to the present 232 1 band by the removal of the\n9\n2\n2@514# proton. The frequency dependence of the alignment\nof the Kp572 band and the 232 1 band is almost identical\n@see Fig. 15~a!#, the difference of about 1\\ in magnitude\nbeing attributable to the additional 92 2@514# proton. This ob-\nservation lends further support to the configuration assign-\nment.\n10. Kp\u02dc 252 \u00bf level at 2098.2 keV (Fig. 3)\nThis level was previously identified by Barne\u00b4oud et al.\n@21# as a Kp5( 252 2) state, based on the large negative an-\ngular distribution coefficient for the 399.7 keV depopulating\ntransition and an assumption of it being E1, although the\npossibility of M1 nature was not discounted. However, in\nthe present work the 399.7 keV transition has been assigned\nM1 character, based on the measured conversion coefficients\ngiven in Table II. The measured angular distribution coeffi-\ncient is A2520.59(21), but this is a combined value for the\n399.7 keV transition and the 399.8 keV transition from the\n2671.1 keV to the 2271.2 keV level ~Fig. 3! which is prob-\nably a J\u2192J transition. The total angular distribution coeffi-044321cient being negative indicates that the spin of the 2098.2 keV\nlevel is likely to be either 212 or 252 . The existence of a 572.9\nkeV transition from the Kp5( 292 )1 state at 2671.1 keV rules\nout the 212 assignment, leading to the 252 1 assignment. A\nband based on this state, extending up to Ip5 292 1 and\ntentatively up to Ip5 312 1 has been identified. The only\nlikely Nilsson configuration is n2$ 72 2@514#, 92 1@624#%\n^ p1$ 92\n2@514#%. The Nilsson estimate of the gK value is 0.46\nwhich changes to 0.56 with the inclusion of alignment ef-\nfects. The experimental value of 0.39~16! compares well\nwith the theoretical estimates and the band alignment of i\n;3\\ , shown in Fig. 15~a!, is consistent with the presence of\nan i13\/2 neutron in the assignment.\n11. Kp\u02dc( 292 )\u00bf state at 2671.1 keV (Fig. 3)\nThis state is mainly fed by the Kp5 312 1 isomer ~see Fig.\n5! and decays to the Kp5 252 1 and 232 1 bands as shown in\nFig. 3. The associated band structure was not identified. The\n155.2 keV transition from the 312 1 isomer to the ( 292 )1 level\n~Fig. 5!, is assigned a M1\/E2 character from the total con-\nversion coefficient given in Table II, hence the assignment of\npositive parity. The existence of various depopulating transi-\ntions, restricts the spin to be either 292 or 272 ; the mixed\nM1\/E2 character of 155.2 keV transition makes it unlikely\nto be the latter, leading to a tentative assignment of ( 292 )1.\nThe bandhead is likely to be a 5-quasiparticle structure as it\nlies close to the other 5-quasiparticle bandheads and is much\nhigher than the 3-quasiparticle bandheads. The Nils-\nson configuration n2$ 52 2@512# , 72 2@514#% ^ p3$ 72 1@404# ,\n9\n2\n2@514# , 12 2@541#% is a possible candidate, but in the ab-\nsence of an associated band, it is not possible to confirm it.\n12. Kp\u02dc 312 \u00bf state at 2826.4 keV (Fig. 4)\nThis isomeric state has several decay routes, with the\nstrongest being to the Kp5 232 1 band members. The other\nbranches go to the ( 292 )1 intrinsic state, and to the members\nof the 72 1@404# and the 172 1 bands, as shown in Fig. 5. The\nmeasured conversion coefficients for the 555.3 and 789.3\nkeV depopulating transitions to the 292 1 and 272 1 levels of the\nKp5 232 1 band, given in Table II, clearly show these transi-\ntions to be of M1 and E2 character, respectively, leading to\nan unambiguous assignment of the spin and parity of the\nstate. The meanlife of this state is determined to be 33\n66 ns as detailed in Sec. IV E.\nThe alignment obtained from the tentative band members\nis ;2.5\\ . Out of the possible Nilsson configurations given\nin Table V, the low alignment favors the first or the second,\nthe third being discounted due to the presence of two aligned\nparticles. The first configuration is expected to be energeti-\ncally favored, but a firm assignment is precluded in the ab-\nsence of information about other in-band properties.\n13. Kp\u02dc 332 \u00c0 state at 2852.6 keV (Fig. 4)\nThis state has a meanlife of 6665 ns and decays to the\nKp5 312 1 level by a 26.2 keV transition, which from the total-24\nCOMPETITION BETWEEN HIGH-K STATES AND . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 61 044321conversion coefficient must be of E1 character. Out of the\npossible spins of 312 2 or 332 2, the former is unlikely as the\nband built on this level is populated more strongly than the\none built on the neighboring Kp5 312 1 level ~2826.4 keV!.\nFurther, if the spin is assumed to be 312 2, it implies Kp\n5 352\n1 for the state at 2956.8 keV ~Fig. 4; see Sec. V C 14!,\nwhich would then be expected to have a decay route to the\nKp5 312 1 level at 2826.4 keV. Such a transition is absent.\nCombined, these observations lead to an assignment of Kp\n5 332\n2 for this state. The alignment obtained from the frag-\nment of the rotational band identified is low, indicating an\nabsence of aligned particles. The Nilsson configuration is\nlikely to be n2$ 52 2@512# , 72 2@514#% ^ p3$ 72 1@404# ,\n9\n2\n2@514# , 52 1@402#%. The gK value for this configuration is\ncalculated to be 0.75, which is to be compared with the ex-\nperimental value of 0.5122619 . All the other possible configu-\nrations resulting in Kp5 332 2 or Kp5 312 2 have two i13\/2 neu-\ntrons and are not consistent with the observed alignment.\n14. Kp\u02dc 352 \u00bf state at 2956.8 keV (Fig. 4)\nThe rotational band based on this new state extends up to\nIp5 492 1 and tentatively to 512 1. The bandhead has a mean-\nlife of 2.665 ns and decays to the Kp5 332 2 state by an\n104.2 keV transition. This transition is assigned E1 character\nfrom the measured conversion coefficients ~Table II! and has\na negative A2, giving spins of 312 1 or 352 1 for the state; the\nhigher spin being favored by the relatively strong population\nof the band.\nThe high alignment of the band ~Fig. 16!, and a com-\npressed spacing between the bandhead and the first rotational\nlevel, both indicate the presence of Coriolis interactions and\nhence the presence of i13\/2 neutrons. The possible\n5-quasiparticle Nilsson configurations for the state are listed\nin Table V. The experimental gK value of 0.82~4! derived\nfrom the lower members of the band favors the first configu-\nration n2$ 72 1@633# , 72 2@514#% ^ p3$ 72 1@404# , 92 2@514# ,\n5\n2\n1@402#%, and agrees well with the gK value calculated in-\ncluding the alignment effects as illustrated in Fig. 17. The\nlowering of the Ip5 372 1 level is likely to be caused by mix-\ning with an ~unobserved! 372 1 intrinsic state, obtained by\nreplacing the 72 1@633# neutron with a 92 1@624# neutron.\n~Such a mixing may also be responsible for the lower gK\nvalue obtained from the higher spin members of the band as\nshown in Fig. 17.! This situation is similar to that of the\nKp5 232 1 band and indeed the frequency dependence and the\nmagnitude of the alignment of both bands is very similar\n@Figs. 15~a! and 16~a!#.\n15. Kp\u02dc( 372 )\u00c0 state at 3287.0 keV (Fig. 4)\nThis level decays by a 71.5 keV transition to the Ip\n5 352\n2 level of the Kp5 332 2 band and by a 330.1 keV tran-\nsition to the Kp5 352 1 state ~Fig. 4!. The 71.5 keV transition\nis assigned M1 character from the total conversion coeffi-\ncient obtained from intensity balance; the E1\/M2 possibility\nis ruled out by the absence of a significant bandhead lifetime.\nSpins of 332 2, 352 2, or 372 2 are possible, but 332 2 and 352 2 are044321unlikely on account of the weak but significant population of\nthis band relative to the Kp5 352 1 band.\nThe band extends up to Ip5( 472 )2 and has a high align-\nment of i;4\\ . The two likely Nilsson configurations are\ngiven in Table V. The experimental gK value of 0.43~4!\nfavors the n4$ 52 2@512# , 72 1@633# , 72 2@514# , 92 1@624#%\n^ p1$ 92\n2@514#% configuration.\n16. Kp\u02dc 432 \u00bf state at 4329.4 keV (Fig. 4)\nA level which decays to the 392 1 and 412 1 members of the\nKp5 352 1 band has been identified but only a tentative iden-\ntification of the first member of its rotational band was pos-\nsible. The 461.5 keV depopulating transition to the 412 1 state\nhas been assigned M1 character from the conversion coeffi-\ncient given in Table II, but its A2 coefficient cannot be mea-\nsured directly since there is another transition at 461.9 keV\nwhich occurs in the 52 1@402# band. A value of A25\n20.18(18) for the 461.5 keV transition has been deduced\nfrom the known relative intensities of the 461.9 and 461.5\nkeV transitions, combined with the knowledge of the average\nof the A2 coefficients for the other E2 transitions in the\n5\n2\n1@402# band. Spins of 392 1, 412 1, or 432 1 are thus possible\nbut a 412 1 value would require a quadrupole admixture which\ncan be excluded by the conversion coefficient. A spin of 392 1\nfor the bandhead is also unlikely given the population, thus\nleading to an assignment of Kp5 432 1. This is consistent with\nthe 818.3 keV branch to the 392 1 level of the Kp5 352 1 band\nbeing relatively weak, due to its implied quadrupole charac-\nter. The meanlife of the state has been measured to be 1.0\n60.3 ns.\nThis state has been assigned the 7-quasiparticle Nilsson\nconfiguration of n4$ 12 2@521# , 52 2@512# , 72 2@514# ,\n9\n2\n1@624#% ^ p3$ 72 1@404# , 92 2@514# , 52 1@402#%. It is unlikely\nto be the second configuration given in Table V which is\nenergetically unfavored.\n17. Kp\u02dc 452 \u00c0 state at 4570.2 keV (Fig. 4)\nThis state decays to the Kp5 432 1 state by a 240.8 keV\ntransition which has been assigned E1 character from the\nmeasured conversion coefficients ~Table II!. The value of\nA250.01(20) deduced for the 240.8 keV transition, after\ntaking account of another 240.9 keV M1 transition in the\n5\n2\n1@402# band, indicates that it is unlikely to be a J\u2192J tran-\nsition. Spins of 412 2 or 452 2 are possible, the higher spin\nbeing favored by weak but observable population of the first\nfew rotational members of the band. Furthermore, the Nils-\nson configuration corresponding to the 412 2 state is expected\nto be higher in energy than the 452 2 level. The Nilsson con-\nfiguration assigned to this state is n4$ 12 2@521# , 72 1@633# ,\n7\n2\n2@514# , 92 1@624#% ^ p3$ 72 1@404# , 92 2@514# , 52 1@402#% and\nis consistent with the observed alignment ~Fig. 16!.\n18.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 61 044321transition, whose measured L conversion and the total con-\nversion coefficient characterize it as E2 ~Table II!. The level\nspin value could be 412 2 or 492 2 but the absence of a g-ray\ntransition (Eg5327 keV) to the 432 1 intrinsic state, despite\nthe inhibited nature of the 86.1 keV transition ~which leads\nto the extremely long meanlife!, is only consistent with\nthe 492 2 possibility.

The relatively\nstrong population of the state and its subsequent decay path\nthrough a sequence of high-K isomers is consistent with its\nhigh-K value and its yrast nature. At this stage the long life-\ntime has precluded identification of transitions above the\nbandhead ~a 257 keV g ray is a candidate!, although from\nthe other bands one could anticipate population of states up\nto ; 512 .\nVI. THE BANDS BASED ON STATES AT 1355.0\nAND 1874.9 keV\nA chance near degeneracy at Ip5 252 2 for these two bands\n~see Fig. 3! gives rise to mixing and therefore out-of-band\ntransitions. The spin assignments are discussed first, fol-\nlowed by band-mixing calculations performed to understand\ntheir structure.\nA. Kp\u02dc 212 \u00c0 state at 1355.0 keV \u0084Fig. 3\u0085\nThe Kp5 212 2 isomeric state was known from previous\nwork @23# and has been the subject of some investigation\n@20,21# due to the K-forbidden nature of its decay. The con-\nversion coefficients given in Table II confirm M1 and E2\nmultipolarities for the 311.3 and 549.9 keV transitions, re-\nspectively. The rotational sequence based on this level ex-\ntends up to 372 2 and possibly up to 392 2.\nB. The band based on the 1874.9 keV level \u0084Fig. 3\u0085\nThis level and its associated rotational band extending up\nto 432\n2 are new. The 248.9 keV transition from the 1874.9\nkeV to the 232 2 level of the Kp5 212 2 band, has been as-\nsigned M1 multipolarity from its total conversion coefficient\n~see Table II!. This, combined with the existence of the\ncrossover transitions to and from the Kp5 212 2 band at 1355\nkeV, fixes the spin and parity of the 1875 keV level as 252 2.\nSince the lower band members have significant out of band\ndecay, the possibility of an unobserved 232 2 or 212 2 level\nbeing the bandhead cannot be ruled out.\nC. Band-mixing calculations\nThe experimental level energies of the two bands ~with an\narbitrary rigid rotor reference removed! versus I(I11) are\nshown in Fig. 18 by the filled symbols, along with those of\nthe nearby 92 2@514# band ~at 73.3 keV, Fig. 1! and Kp\n5 192\n2 band ~at 1602.7 keV, Fig. 2!. In the figure perturba-\ntions are evident in the energy levels of the Kp5 212 2 band at\nspin 252 , and in the Kp5 92 2 band at higher spins, with the\nlatter possibly due to mixing with the Kp5 192 2 band. A\nband-mixing analysis including states from the Kp5 92 2044321band, the rotation-aligned band (s band!, the Kp5 212 2 band\nand the band based on the 1874.9 keV level was carried out\nto reproduce the experimental energy levels around Ip\n5 252\n2\n. The rotational states were calculated by assuming\nspin-independent interactions and moments of inertia which\ndefined the unperturbed bands. The perturbed levels, shown\nin Fig. 18 by the solid lines, reproduce well the experimental\nlevels and also the perturbation of the 252 2 and 272 2 levels of\nthe 212 2 band and the band beginning at 1874.9 keV. The\nbranching ratios for these two bands were then calculated\nassuming different gK2gR values depending on the assump-\ntions about their configurations as detailed in the next two\nsections.\n1. Structure of the Kp\u02dc 212 \u00c0 band at 1355.0 keV\nThere are four possible Nilsson configurations for this\nstructure:\n~i! p3$ 92 2@514# , 72 1@404# , 52 1@402#%,\n~ii! n2$ 72 2@514# , 52 2@512#% ^ p1$ 92 2@514#%,\n~iii! n2$ 72 2@514# , 72 1@633#% ^ p1$ 72 1@404#%,\n~iv! n2$ 72 2@514# , 92 1@624#% ^ p1$ 52 1@402#%.\nSimilar three-quasiparticle 212 2 isomers and bands based\non them are known in 175Ta, where the 212 2 band has a p3\nstructure, and in 179Ta where the structure is proposed to be\na mixture of configurations ~i!, ~ii!, and ~iv!. In Ref. @7# the\nevolution of these configurations was studied for a series of\ntantalum isotopes and it was seen that while configuration ~i!\nis favored in 175Ta, all four configurations listed above are\npredicted to be close ~energetically! in 177Ta. Indeed, in a\nprevious work @21# the 212 2 state in 177Ta was thought to be\nan admixture of configurations ~i! and ~ii!.\nThe experimental branching ratios yield a value of gK\n2gR;0.45 at low spins and ;0.36 at higher spins, neither\nof which match well with expectations for any of the above\nfour configurations ~Table V!, though they are closest to that\nof configuration ~ii!, which however does not have an\naligned particle. As shown in Fig. 15~b!, the band starts with\na low alignment of ;1\\ which rises rapidly to ;6\\ . A gain\nin alignment would be expected if mixing with configura-\ntions with an aligned particle occur, but such a rapid gain is\ndifficult to explain. The band-mixing analysis that follows,\nreproduces the branching intensities at the lower spins, but\ndoes not resolve the problem of explaining the gK2gR val-\nues and the alignment.\nThe calculations were performed with two different gK\n2gR values for the Kp5 212 2 band, the first assuming gK\n2gR50.8 consistent with p3 configuration and the second\ntaking gK2gR50.34. The latter is an empirical value ob-\ntained from the branching of the Ip5 332 2 level where mixing\nwith other bands is not expected ~see Fig. 18!. This approach\nwas preferred rather than the assumption of a value corre-\nsponding to one of the above four n2p configurations. In\nboth calculations, the band beginning at 1874.9 keV was\nassumed to have Kp5 212 2 with gK2gR50.17, obtained\nfrom the experimental branching ratios from its Ip5 332 2\nlevel. The experimental and calculated dipole intensity for\nthe in-band and out-of-band transitions for the two bands are-26\nCOMPETITION BETWEEN HIGH-K STATES AND . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 61 044321plotted in Fig. 19. While the calculation assuming gK2gR\n50.8 ~lower panels! agrees with the experimental values up\nto spin 272 , it disagrees at higher spin values where a value of\ngK2gR50.34 explains the data better, indicating a change in\nstructure of the 212 2 band from a p3 configuration at lower\nspins to a n2p configuration at higher spins.\nThe structure of the band at higher spins, however, re-\nmains an enigma since as indicated previously, the calcula-\ntions, while successful in reproducing the branchings of the\nlower spin members, do not explain the experimental align-\nment or the gK2gR values. The situation is made more com-\nplex since mixing of configuration ~i! with all the others, i.e.,\n~ii!\u2013~iv! is likely in 177Ta @7#.

A\nquantitative comparison may be possible with a more com-\nplex band-mixing calculation, including the Kp5 192 2 band,\nbut has not been pursued as yet due to the inherent ambigu-\nities.\n2.

DISCUSSION\nA. K-forbidden g-ray transitions\nElectromagnetic transitions for which changes in the K\nquantum number are larger than the transition multipolarity\nFIG. 21. The experimental relative branching ratios for the Kp\n5\n21\n2\n2 band at 1355.0 keV and the band above the 1874.9 keV state\nare compared with the results of band-mixing calculations ~see Sec.\nVI C! assuming K5 212 ~bottom panel! or K5\n25\n2 ~top panel! for the\nlatter band.044321(l) are, in principle, forbidden, although in practice they are\nobserved but hindered. A measure of the amount of retarda-\ntion is provided by the K hindrance per degree of K forbid-\ndenness f n , defined as\nf n5~Tg \/TW!1\/n, ~3!\nwhere Tg is the partial g-ray halflife and and TW is the\nWeisskopf single-particle estimate.\nIn addition to the well-known Kp5 212 2 isomer at 1355.0\nkeV, the present study reveals the presence of several new\nisomers which decay by K-forbidden transitions, as listed in\nTable VI with their f n values. Note that for E1 transitions,\nthe TW value is multiplied by 103 before calculating f n to\ntake account of the fact that normal transitions are already\nusually hindered. The values for transitions from the Kp\n5 172\n1 and 212 2 isomers closely correspond with those of 172 1\nand 212 2 states in 175Ta @6# which are structurally identical.\nThe 257 and 502 keV transitions ~both to the Kp5 172 1 band!\nand the 552 keV transition ~to the Kp5 72 1 band! depopulat-\ning the Kp5 312 1 isomer, are anomalously fast, with f n val-\nues lower than systematics would suggest. For the 257 and\n502 keV transitions, this can be attributed at least partly to\nlocal mixing with the 312 1 member of the Kp5 172 1 band\nwhich is within 14 keV. Further, the Kp5 72 1 band alignment\n~see Fig. 14! shows a gain at around Ip5 272 1 corresponding\nto the alignment of i13\/2 neutrons, which would lead to a\nmixed K for the higher spin states. This, combined with the\nmixing of the 72 1 band with Kp5 172 1 band ~the 292 1 states\nare within 12 keV!, leads to a smaller f n value for the 552.2\nkeV transition which connects the Kp5 312 1 isomeric state to\nthe 272 1 member of the Kp5 72 1 band. A similar local-mixing\nsituation, leading to small f n values, has been reported for\nthe 5-quasiparticle isomer in 175Hf @43#.\nIn addition to the states listed in Table VI, the K5( 172 )\nstate at 1476.9 keV ~Fig. 2! and the Kp5 192 2 state at 1602.7\nkeV ~Fig. 2!, also decay by K-forbidden transitions. The f n\nvalues for the transitions depopulating these two states are in\nagreement with the systematics.\nB. Multiquasiparticle calculations\nIn our earlier work @4# good agreement was obtained be-\ntween the experimental energies and those from BCS calcu-\nlations, with the inclusion of blocking for multiquasiparticle-30\nCOMPETITION BETWEEN HIGH-K STATES AND . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 61 044321states. However, this agreement could be fortuitous due to\nthe inherent limitations @44\u201346# of the BCS theory, which\nresults in an artificial collapse of pairing for low values of\nthe pairing-force strength, as seen in our previous calcula-\ntions @4#. These limitations can partly be overcome if the\npairing correlations are treated using the Lipkin-Nogami for-\nmalism @47#. In this section we present such calculations.\nThe single-particle energies required as inputs to the cal-\nculations, were obtained from the Nilsson model using the\ndeformation parameters given in Sec. V A. The energies of\nthe states close to the Fermi surface were subsequently ad-\njusted to reproduce approximately the experimental one-\nquasiparticle energies, in 177Ta in the case of protons, and an\naverage of 177Hf and 177W energies in the case of neutrons.\nPairing force strengths of Gp520.7\/A MeV and Gn\n518.3\/A MeV were used for the calculations, yielding\nground-state pairing gaps of 866 and 742 keV, respectively.\nFollowing this procedure, the multiquasiparticle energies\nwere calculated without further adjustment of parameters.\nThese calculations in general agree well with those of Ref.\n@7#, where calculations were performed to obtain a consistent\npicture of the multiquasiparticle states in a series of Ta iso-\ntopes, but the parameters in the present case have been ad-\njusted slightly for 177Ta. As a result, the 7-quasiparticle\nstates, all of which contain a 92 1@624# neutron, are repro-\nduced better in the present calculation and it is likely that in\nthe calculations of Ref. @7#, the 92 1@624# level was taken to\nbe too close to the Fermi surface.\nThe resulting comparison with experiment is presented in\nTable VII along with the values for the pairing energies for\nprotons and neutrons and the residual interactions @46#. For\nease of comparison, the excitation energies relative to the\n1\n2\n2@541# band members, as a function of spin, are shown in\nFig. 22. The calculations, with the inclusion of residual in-\nteraction energies, are in good agreement with the excitation\nenergies of the experimentally observed multiquasiparticle\nFIG. 22. Comparison between experimental ~filled points! and\ncalculated ~hollow points! yrast and near-yrast multiquasiparticle\nstates in 177Ta relative to the 12 2@541# band. For the Kp5\n21\n2\n2 state,\ntwo experimental points are shown, one for the 1355.0 keV state\nand the other at 1467 keV which is the predicted energy from the\nband-mixing calculation ~see Sec. VI C!, of the 212 2 bandhead as-\nsociated with the 1874.9 keV band.044321states. It is of note that almost all the states which are pre-\ndicted to lie in close proximity to the yrast line have been\nobserved.\nEven though the overall agreement is good, there are dis-\nagreements which need comment. The calculated 192 1 state\nwith a configuration n2$ 52 2, 72 2% ^ p$ 72 1% is predicted to be\nsignificantly lower than any corresponding observed state.\nExperimentally, only a 192 2 state ~1603 keV! is observed\nwith no plausible candidate for a 192 1 state. Considering the\ncomponent configurations among the neighboring even-even\nnuclei, a n2$ 52 2, 72 2% configuration forming a 61 state, oc-\ncurs @9# in 178W at an excitation energy of 1666 keV. Thus\nthe 192 1 state formed by the addition of p$ 72 1%, which is the\nground-state configuration of 177Ta, is expected to have an\nexcitation energy of ;1670 keV. However, it may not com-\npete favorably with the 192 2 configuration which has an\naligned particle, thus possibly accounting for the 192 1 state\nnot being observed. However, it also indicates that the\npresent calculations underpredict the excitation energy of the\nn2$ 52\n2\n,\n7\n2\n2% combination. This deduction is also supported\nby the fact that the Kp5 332 2 state, assigned a n2$ 52 2, 72 2%\n^ p3$ 52\n1\n,\n7\n2\n1\n,\n9\n2\n2% configuration, has an excitation energy\nhigher than predicted, even though the predicted energy for\nthe p3 component, resulting in a 212 2 state, matches very\nwell with experiment.\nThe 252 1 state at 2098 keV interacts with the 252 1 level\n~1835 keV! of the 232 1 band leading to the compression of\nthe first rotational excitation of the latter ~see Fig. 3!. Since\nthe lower 252 1 state is pushed down by ;35 keV due to the\ninteraction, the experimental ~upper! Kp5 252 1 state is ex-\npected be pushed up by a similar amount. This reduces the\ndiscrepancy between the calculated and observed state to\n;117 keV. The calculations predict a 372 1 configuration to\nbe ;400 keV lower than the 372 2 configuration, but the\nformer has not been identified and the latter lies 225 keV\nbelow the calculated value ~see Table VII!. The reason for\nthe 372 1 state not being observed could be due to mixing with\nthe closely related structure of Kp5 352 1, which also results\nin lowering of the 372 1 member of the 352 1 band as seen\nexperimentally ~Fig. 4!.\nPredicted states with spins higher than 492 are also listed in\nTable VII. The 9-quasiparticle Kp5 672 2 state, at an excita-\ntion energy of 8553 keV, is predicted to be an yrast trap,\nwhich is consistent with the expectations of calculations by\n\u00c5berg @17#. This state could decay either by a low energy\n~;30 keV! M2 transition to the 632 1 state ~the 632 1 state is\nexpected to be lower in energy than the 632 2 state due to the\nresidual interactions! or by an E3 transition of ;700 keV\nto the 612 1 state. In either case the transition will be slow,\nleading to a long lifetime for the 672 2 state.\nC. Formation of the yrast line\nThe competition between the intrinsic high-K states and\ntheir collective structures in forming the yrast line in the\nodd-even Ta isotopes is determined primarily by the position\nof the neutron Fermi surface. For the lighter isotopes like-31\nM. DASGUPTA et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 61 044321173Ta and 175Ta, the Fermi surface lies around the 12 2@521#\nand 52 2@512# low-V orbitals and thus the high-K configura-\ntions with 72 1@633# and 92 1@624# neutrons are higher in en-\nergy. Consequently, the p1$ 12 2@541#% rotational band re-\nmains yrast @7# up to very high spins. On the other hand, in\nthe heavier 179Ta isotope the neutron Fermi level lies be-\ntween the 72 2@514# and 92 1@624# orbitals, and the yrast line\nis formed by high-K multiquasiparticle states and the collec-\ntive structures associated with their rotation.\nIn 177Ta, the neutron Fermi surface lies between the\n5\n2\n2@512# and 72 2@514# orbitals, which is approximately in\nthe middle of the 72 1@633# and 92 1@624# high-V orbitals.\nConsequently, high-K two- and four-quasineutron configura-\ntions occur at low energies and the situation is similar for the\none- or three-quasiproton configurations, with the result that\nmany competing multiquasiparticle states can be formed. As\nillustrated in Fig. 22, the yrast line is formed by the 12 2@541#\nband up to I; 352 , after which high-K states each with con-\nfigurations involving large-V orbitals and their collective ro-\ntation become yrast.\nAlthough the three-quasiparticle configurations all lie\nabove the yrast line, the occurrence of many closely related\nhigh-K structures gives rise to complex mixing and thus to\nfeatures in the rotational structures ~see Sec. VI!, which are\nnot yet fully understood. The five-quasiparticle Kp5 352 1\nband at 2956.8 keV becomes yrast at I. 352 , with further\nchanges occurring at I5 452 and 492 , where the Kp5 452 2 and\nthe Kp5 492 2 states become yrast, respectively. These states\ndecay by transitions minimizing the change in K, to the ro-\ntational band members built on high-K bandheads or directly\nto high-K intrinsic states, thus enabling many quasiparticle\nstates and their rotational bands to be identified.\nThe least retarded decay path for the Kp5 492 2 state is\nthus to the Kp5 452 2 state by a low-energy ~86.1 keV!, high\nmultipolarity (E2) transition leading to its long meanlife.\nThe 492 2 state can thus be identified as a spin trap. An almost\nidentical situation arises for the Kp5222 spin-trap @12# in\nthe neighboring 176Hf nucleus with a configuration similar to\nthe Kp5 492 2 state \u0084 492 25222 ^ p1( 52 1@402#)\u0085, which has a044321meanlife of 62 ms and decays to a 202 state by a 97 keV E2\ntransition.\nVIII. CONCLUSIONS\nThe nucleus 177Ta, with its neutron and proton Fermi sur-\nfaces lying close to orbitals with large values of V , is ideal\nfor investigating the high-K multiquasiparticle states, their\nrotational structure and structural changes which occur due\nto competing configurations. The study reveals a multitude\nof high-seniority states, some of which are isomeric. Time-\ncorrelated g-ray data were essential in order to identify\nweakly populated isomeric states and the associated rota-\ntional bands.\nConfigurations for the observed intrinsic states were as-\nsigned on the basis of their decay and the properties of their\nrotational bands. While most of the bands are well under-\nstood, the behavior of some of the bands, most notably the\none built on the Kp5 212 2 3-quasiparticle isomer, is difficult\nto explain. Such anomalous behavior is possibly due to mix-\ning with several competing configurations at high spins in\n177Ta. Nevertheless, almost all the intrinsic states which are\npredicted by multiquasiparticle calculations to lie close to the\nyrast line, have been observed experimentally.\nThe Kp5 212 2 and 492 2 states are very long lived (8.6\n60.3 ms and 19266 ms, respectively! as a result of sub-\nstantial K hindrance in the former but of spin trapping in the\nlatter. The calculations predict the existence of a Kp5 672 2\nyrast isomer at an excitation energy of about 8.5 MeV. Ex-\nperimentally, it is difficult to form such high angular mo-\nmentum states using stable beams except through low cross-\nsection reactions involving charged particle emission.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank S.S.
