Lushingtonwrote a somewhat breathless letter to the secretary to\nthe government of Bengal. He described how the night before, Captain\nC.M. Cawley, commander of the steamer Brahmapootra, had arrived at\nhis house in disarray, to tell a \u2018desperate and fatal\u2019 tale.

Like hundreds of men and women each year, the convicts on\nboard were to be imprisoned in the huge jail at Alipur on the outskirts\nof Calcutta while they awaited their transportation overseas. Their\ndestination was Moulmein in the Tenasserim Provinces, one of the\nEast India Company\u2019s penal settlements in Southeast Asia, and the\nplace to which the British shipped all Indian transportation convicts\nthat year. But this usually routine journey had erupted in violence\nand bloodshed. About 20 miles from Patna, a \u2018notorious Sikh Sirdar\u2019\ncalled Narain Sing had, Lushington reported, broken off the convicts\u2019\nirons, raided the vessel\u2019s weapon store, and having seen off the crew\nand passengers taken charge of the ship. Captain Cawley had run his\nship ashore and \u2018fled for his life\u2019.\nLushington lost no time, mustering the Behar station guard and\na \u2018darogah of activity\u2019, and marching overnight with his men to the\nriverbank in pursuit of the mutineers. He was especially concerned\nto secure the gurdwara (temple) in Patna city, for it was an important\nplace of Sikh pilgrimage that marked the birthplace of the ninth guru,\nGobind Singh. Lushington wrote later of the \u2018truly awful\u2019 scene that\ngreeted him when he boarded the ships: \u2018The decks of both vessels\nwere dyed with blood at one end lay a man with his stomach ripped\nopen near him was a pool of Blood where it is said a man\u2019s head\nhad been severed from his body besides these there were 2 other\ncorpses and 6 individuals more or less slightly wounded\u2019. There was no\nsign of the convict mutineers, and so Lushington sent several parties\nout in search of them while he began his investigation. It seemed at\nfirst that the mutiny began during the daily routine of washing and\nbathing. When the common chain that linked the leg irons of one\nhalf of the convict challan (chain gang) was opened, and the other half\nlocked, the prisoners \u2018rose simultaneously\u2019, seizing 18 muskets that\nunaccountably had been left within arms\u2019 reach of their quarters.2\nThe outbreak was brutal and ruthless; the mutineers even threw two\nwounded convicts overboard to ensure that they were not alive to give\nevidence against them.3 In his later report of events, commander of the\n2 APAC India Office Records (henceforth IOR) P\/143\/51 (Bengal Judicial 31 July\n1850): E.H.

Nation claimed that the convicts\nhad taken advantage of a \u2018few and careless\u2019 guard, writing that little\nmore could have been expected of such low paid men.4 Chief Mate\nJohn Chew added that the 16 guards on board \u2013 eight sepoys and\neight specially hired burkundazes \u2013 \u2018even said that they were not going\nto risk their lives for 3 Rupees\u2019.5 Like Lushington, Captain Nation\nhad no doubt who had led the uprising: \u2018when I mention the name of\n\u201cNarain Sing\u201d a Sikh General and 4 of his subordinates as amongst\nthe convicts\u2019, he remarked, \u2018it will be sufficient answer to the success\nof the enterprise\u2019.6\nNarain Sing\u2019s identity needed no further elaboration at the time,\nfor he was well known as a military leader who had fought against\nthe British in the Anglo\u2013Sikh Wars (1845\u20131846, 1848\u20131849). In\nthe aftermath of the annexation of the Panjab (1849), he was found\nguilty of treason and sentenced to transportation for life. His journey\ninto exile began on the Kaleegunga. And yet it is intriguing that this\nextraordinary mid nineteenth-century military figure barely figures in\nhistories of either colonial India or the Panjab. This paper will use\narchival remnants of Narain Sing\u2019s life as a means of opening up three\nrelated questions, and thus working through the historiographical\nmeaning of his near-anonymity. The first question centres on a\nconsideration of the broader social meanings that we might attribute\nto the differential treatment of different types of convicts \u2013 \u2018ordinary\u2019\nand \u2018political\u2019 \u2013 by the British during this period. The second is\nconcerned with the relationship between such difference and the\npolitical economy of colonial labour regimes. Thirdly, and perhaps\nmost significantly, Narain Sing gives us important insights into society\nand social transformation during the 1840s\u20131860s, most particularly\nwith respect to enhancing our understanding of shifts in British\u2013Sikh\nrelations. Historians have established that ideas about Sikh cruelty\nand betrayal during the Anglo\u2013Sikh Wars gave way to admiration for\n4 IOR P\/143\/51 (Bengal Judicial 31 July 1850): Captain H.M.

A close reading of\nNarain Sing\u2019s transformation from military general to transportation\nconvict allows us to explore the period 1849\u20131857 in these respects in\nmore depth. Moreover, his social biography is of broader significance\nto our understanding of the changes to and solidification of colonial\nidentities in the period after the transition from East India Company\nto direct British rule in 1858.\nService, Salt and Status\nDuring the first quarter of the nineteenth century, from his base in\nLahore, the great ruler of the Panjab Ranjit Singh revived prosperity\nand extended state patronage to build an empire across the northwest\nof the Indian subcontinent. With disciplined infantry and artillery at\nhis disposal, and through the incorporation of Hindus and Muslims\ninto a Sikh dominated ruling class, Ranjit Singh ejected a series of\nlocal leaders and established a vast military empire that, by the time\nhe died in 1839, stretched from the river Sutlej in the south to the\nmountain ranges in the north \u2013 northwest of the region. In the context\nof the expansion of British influence across India, Ranjit Singh\u2019s death\nmarked the beginning of the end of local sovereignty. The East India\nCompany took advantage of a series of power struggles that erupted\nin the nobility, coupled with the growing influence of the army in\nthe region, to bring forwards its ambitions for annexation. When the\nLahore army crossed the Sutlej river at the end of 1845, the British\nclaimed that it was an act of aggression and so declared war. During\nthe military campaigns that followed, both sides suffered heavy losses,\nbut eventually after a series of battles through the winter of 1845\u2013\n1846 and into 1848\u20131849 (the First and Second Anglo\u2013Sikh Wars\nrespectively), the Company annexed the Panjab. In a single stroke, it\nextended its influence across north India: from Calcutta in the east to\nthe Northwest Frontier.8\nAt the time of annexation in March 1849, Narain Singh was an\nofficer in the Sikh Irregular Horse under the command of the rebel\ngovernor of Multan, Mul Raj. During 1847, the British had chipped\n7 Richard G.

However, his troops stood to lose a great deal\nfrom this shift in power and in April 1848 they attacked and killed\ntwo British officers, Patrick Vans Agnew and William Anderson, thus\nmanoeuvring Mul Raj into leading a revolt.9 During the second half\nof 1848 Narain Singh was active under Mul Raj\u2019s leadership in the\ndistricts between Multan and Lahore, but in the face of a series of\ndecisive British victories, both men surrendered in January 1849.\nNarain Sing claimed later that he had been led to believe that he\nwould be \u2018favourably received\u2019.10 However, the British placed him in\ncustody in Lahore jail, where Mul Raj joined him a few days later.\nMul Raj was found guilty of having been an accessory to the\nmurders of Vans Agnew and Anderson, and was transferred as a state\nprisoner to a disused chapel in Fort William (Calcutta) with a view\nto his eventual transportation to the Company\u2019s penal settlement at\nSingapore. At the time his health was so poor that Governor-General\nDalhousie believed that he would not survive the journey.

It found him guilty and\nsentenced him to transportation for life. Central to understanding his\nsentence was the claim that he had been made \u2018an especial exception\namong the prisoners who surrendered during the war\u2019. This was in\nlarge part because of his \u2018many cruelties\u2019, including cutting off the\nhands of a man who had fallen as a supplicant at his feet. He was, it\nwas said, \u2018a most dangerous man, clever and cruel\u2019.13 The first part\nof Narain Sing\u2019s penal journey was a march to Agra with 13 other\nstate prisoners under the guard of the 17th Native Infantry. The\ncommissioner of Lahore warned that Narain Sing had \u2018considerable\ninfluence\u2019, and should be well secured.14 From Agra, Narain Sing went\non to Allahabad, where he was transferred to the Kaleegunga for the\njourney up the Ganges to the holding jail for transportation convicts\nat Alipur, just outside Calcutta. Amongst the Kaleegunga convicts was\nanother state prisoner called Golaub Sing, who had been convicted of\ntreason in Lahore three months before Narain Sing.15\nIt is clear from this brief account that Narain Sing was no ordinary\nprisoner, but rather a man of \u2018political importance\u2019.16 Indeed, when\nhe began his journey into transportation, officials in the Northwest\nProvinces were keenly aware of his social and political status. Narain\nSing himself later claimed that when he was taken from Lahore to\nAgra: \u2018I was treated and ranked as a Sirdar\u2019. He complained that on\narrival in the city his belongings \u2013 an unusually large quantity for a\nconvict, including clothing, cloth and blankets, a range of iron and\nbrass cooking pots and pans and even a mirror17 \u2013 and servants were\ntaken away.

On admission to prison he was \u2018turbulent abusive to jail\nofficers\u2019, and took off his handcuffs \u2018like a pair of gloves\u2019, throwing\nthem at the mohurir \u2018with some insulting remarks\u2019.19\nInspector of Prisons W.H. Woodcock reported that when Narain\nSing was made over to him in Agra, he had been warned that he was\n\u2018a desperate character . . .who would probably abuse his influence\u2019. He\nrequested a party of sepoys to escort him on to Allahabad. Nine of\nhis fellow convicts were to be imprisoned in the jail there, and five,\nincluding Narain Sing, were to be forwarded to Alipur.20 But it seems\nthat thoughWoodcock\u2019s warnings were heeded for part of the journey,\nno special measures were taken for the men\u2019s river transfer out of\nAllahabad.21 The commander of the Kaleegunga, John Stout, stated\nlater that he had been given no details of the convicts \u2018beyond that\nof their being life prisoners\u2019.22 According to the officiating magistrate\nin Patna, it was the \u2018gross carelessness and neglect\u2019 in this respect\nthat caused the outbreak.23 Further, it emerged later on that at times\nthe guard had been armed with bayonets only, because most of the\nmuskets were unserviceable and there was little ammunition.24\nThis failure in communication reflected a broader ambivalence on\nthe part of the British about the appropriate treatment of Narain\nSing and the other military prisoners. The superintendent of police in\nthe Lower Provinces, W. Dampier, believed that the outbreak on the\nKaleegunga was the result of \u2018uncalled for degradation\u2019. He wrote: \u2018I\nconsider that the sending down [of] Narain Sing and the other Sikh\nSirdars, certainly men of some rank and Soldiers . . . chained up with\nThugs and Murderers of all castes and descriptions to have been a\nconsiderable aggravation of their sentence\u2019.

On the day of the uprising, at some\ntime between 4.00 and 4.30 pm, when it was time for the daily routine\nof going on deck to perform ablutions, the convicts on this side of the\nchain said that they did not want to go. The guards therefore unlocked\nthe convicts on the other side, including Narain Sing. They went to\nthe side of the ship \u2013 where as was normal practice convicts urinated,\nvoided their bowels or threw overboard rag-bound packets of solid\nwaste \u2013 and Narain Sing gave a shout, the agreed signal for mutiny.\nThe convicts on the other (cut) chain got free, and together the men\novercame their guards. It had been well organized; small groups of\nfour or five convicts went for each guard, stealing their muskets and\nforcing them overboard. Another group of convicts took the spare\nmuskets and ammunition belts. They stayed on board for a couple of\nhours, plundered some cloth and money, and then got into another\nboat, crossed the river and fled.29\nDespite their initial success, it was not long before the British\nhad captured the escaped men and moved swiftly to set up a formal\n26 IOR F\/4\/2484: Extract letter Under Secretary to Government of India to Under\nSecretary to Government Bengal, 29 Oct. 1850.\n27 IOR P\/SEC\/IND\/166 (India Secret 27 Sept. 1850): Melville to Elliot, 26 July\n1850.\n28 IOR P\/143\/51 (Bengal Judicial 31 July 1850): Lushington to Grant, 10 July\n1850.

The trial took place\nover 11 days in February and March 1851.31 The judges of the court\nsentenced three of the convicts \u2013 Narain Sing, Nutha and Janna \u2013 to\ndeath, though recommended their pardon. This reflected their more\ngeneral concern that it was impossible to establish that all the convicts\nhad participated actively in the outbreak, as opposed to having been\npresent when it took place. During the trial only Narain Sing was\nidentified positively, and only then by the commander and first mate.\nOther witnesses failed to single him out during identity parades. This\nwas hardly surprising given the pandemonium that had prevailed on\nthe mutinous Kaleegunga; difficulties in positive identification were a\ncommon feature of mutiny investigations and trials during the first\nhalf of the nineteenth century.32 But the judges\u2019 recommendation for\nmercy went deeper than this, for it reflected disagreements between\nthem about the implications of the sharply differentiated social status\nof the convicts on board.\nSessions Judge F.J. Lougham hinted that Captain Cawley had been\nunwilling to name Narain Sing individually, most likely because he\nknew that if he were convicted he would be sentenced to death. Thus\nCawley\u2019s testimony had shifted radically. Initially, he said that he had\nseen Narain Sing with a musket and, later, that Narain Sing had not\nparticipated in the uprising and that he could not remember if he\nhad been armed. We need to think about Captain Cawley\u2019s changing\nclaim in the context of his respect for Narain Sing\u2019s rank and status.\nWhen he was arrested, Narain Sing stated that he had been driven to\nescape by the hardship of altered treatment since his initial capture\nin the Panjab. His daily allowance had been reduced from 100 rupees\nto three pice per day, and he had been \u2018chained with out castes\u2019.\nSessions Judge Lougham\u2019s opinion is worth citing at length, for it\nreveals something of contemporary beliefs about the social meaning\nof equality before the law:\n30 IOR P\/143\/51 (Bengal Judicial 31 July 1850): Lushington to Grant, 10 July\n1850, enc.

This prisoner for aiding and abetting in\nmurder under circumstances of far less atrocity and as a means of escaping\nshould be adjudged to suffer death.\nLougham disagreed with the court\u2019s recommendation that the two\nother convicts found guilty, Natha and Janna, should be recommended\nfor pardon along with Narain Sing. They were \u2018hardened offenders\u2019, he\nargued, transported for \u2018murder by thuggee\u2019. Accordingly, he advised\ntheir execution.\nAlso significant in the debate about the appropriate punishment of\nNarain Sing was his conduct during the outbreak, which was in itself\nrepresented through the lens of colonial expectations attached to a\nman of his military standing. Narain Sing drew attention to his subkut\no joweer nurdee, or \u2018successful bravery\u2019.33 Despite earlier representations\nof his ruthlessness and cruelty, near-romantic accounts of his\nhonourable and gentlemanly conduct on the Kaleegunga emerged. The\npassengers on board included SergeantMichael Cunningham, his wife\nMary and their two children, one a babe in arms. Though there were\ndiscrepancies in their account of the mutiny \u2013 Mary spoke in court\na year afterwards of how she had tried to forget about it \u2013 it seems\nthat Narain Sing intervened against the wishes of the other convicts\non board to save her life. This is what she said:\n[The convicts] tookmy husband who hadmy eldest child in his arms on deck. I\nwas following with my youngest child when they ordered me to remain where\nI was afore . . . shortly after that a number of them that is the prisoners came\nto the door of the cabin and asked me if I could set the steamer going and\nwork the engines I said no.

Indeed, one of his co-defendants,\nconvict Nutha, stated that he had seen Narain Sing prevent a third\nman from killing Mary Cunningham. \u2018I am already involved in one\ntrouble and now another trouble will come upon me\u2019, he claimed he\nhad said to the man. \u2018Do not kill the Saheb and the Maam, run away\u2019.\nMary\u2019s husband Michael appeared in a much less favourable light. He\ntestified that he had jumped overboard, leaving his wife and children\nto an uncertain fate. As Captain Nation put it later on, the disgrace\nNarain Sing\u2019s actions cast on the character of Europeans \u2018is not to be\ncontemplated without regret\u2019.35\nNarain Sing sought to distance himself from the mutiny altogether,\nstating in court that he had told the havildar of the guard of the planned\nuprising, and had only escaped because he feared that due to his rank\nand standing he would be held accountable. Furthermore, he claimed,\nhe had prevented the convicts from plundering the treasure on board\nand from setting fire to the ships, as well as having saved the life of\nMary Cunningham and her children.36 These were to be recurrent\nthemes in his letters to government over the coming years. \u2018All the\nconvicts then got enraged with me saying that you have connived at\nthe Saheb\u2019s escape; now we will ill treat the lady and kill her . . .

He lamented the\ntreatment of the women of his household by British troops during\ntheir military campaigns in the Panjab. He complained that his wife,\ndaughter and female slaves had been treated in \u2018a most disgraceful\nmanner, which is a very shameful thing, such treatment is never\nallowed by any sovereign to a person faithful to his master\u2019. And,\nmoreover, he claimed that on learning of this the \u2018enraged\u2019 General\nWhish (who had led the 1848\u20131849 siege of Multan) ordered the\nwomen\u2019s return. His account of events substantively anticipated the\ncolonial response to actual or threatened violence against European\nwomen by mutineer-rebels during 1857\u20131858, and thus reveals\nsomething of shared expectations around the protection of women\nin wartime. But it also drew on associated discourses and practices\nassociated with military service. Narain Sing wrote of his bafflement\nat being punished: \u2018when a person renders service to another nation\nthat nation supports andmaintains that person\u2019, and: \u2018I have not eaten\nsalt belonging to the Company I have eaten [Mul Raj\u2019s] salt\u2019.38 His\nwords were echoed by fellow Panjabi state prisoner Ram Sing, who\nhad served under Mul Raj and wrote in a petition seeking remission\nof sentence: it was a servant\u2019s \u2018duty to do as he is told\u2019.39\nGovernment took into consideration Narain Sing\u2019s \u2018position and\nconduct\u2019 and decided to follow the judges\u2019 recommendation of a\ncommutation of the death sentence. That he was \u2018a Sikh officer of\nrank\u2019 sentenced for treason, and yet had been fettered with thugs\nand dacoits and \u2018made to associate with sweepers\u2019, informed its\nclemency. But of enormous relevance to its decision also was the\n\u2018humanity\u2019 he had shown in saving European lives. In rescuing Mary\nCunningham from the convict mob, Narain Sing had demonstrated\nhonour and courage \u2013 in stark contrast to her husbandMichael, whose\ncowardly behaviour in the face of danger so disgraced the British.\nGovernment ordered the commutation of the other two convicts\u2019\ncapital sentences too, in their case because there was no direct\nevidence against them.40 It ordered the transportation of all threemen\n38 IOR F\/4\/2527: Translation of the Petition of Narain Singh, 12 Dec. 1851.\n39 IORP\/201\/62 (India Foreign25 July1856): J.C.Haughton,Magistrate in charge\nof Moulmein jail, to A.

Narain Sing was kept in solitary confinement\nunder a strong guard. The convicts\u2019 spirit of resistance remained\nintact; an escape attempt was foiled only through the quick thinking\nof the turnkey, who had noticed two convicts free from irons, and so\nraised the alarm. It seems that the convicts had concealed files in the\nprison ward, and had started to knock a hole through the brickwork of\nthe privy wall.42 Magistrate Lushington reported a few months later\nthat they continued openly to make escape plans. Thus the convicts\nwere divided into two batches, and taken on to Calcutta separately.\nLushington was especially keen to avoid complaints of ill treatment\non the part of Narain Sing.43\nThe Politics of Punishment in Southeast Asia\nAs late as 1848, 20 years after the British annexed Burma, there were\nonly 150 locally convicted prisoners in the Tenasserim Provinces. The\nremainder were all convicts from the Indian mainland, transported\nby the East India Company to clear land and build roads. They\nworked in labour gangs during the day, and were kept in the flimsy\nwooden bungalows that served as jails at night.44 Their numbers\ngrew exponentially, and more permanent prison buildings were\nconstructed. In 1856 there were 236 convicts in Mergui jail and\n1460 in Moulmein; by 1858, the average daily jail population in the\nprovinces was 2,421.45\nAs we will see, Narain Sing\u2019s experience of penal transportation\nwas in many ways radically different to that of the convict mass.\n41 IOR P\/144\/12: List of 58 convicts for Moulmein per Fire Queen, 9 Dec. 1851.\n42 IOR P\/144\/5 (Bengal Judicial 23 July 1851): Lushington to Grant, 29 Apr.\n1851.\n43 IOR P\/144\/6 (Bengal Judicial 20Aug. 1851): Lushington to Grant, 8Aug. 1851;\nJ.W.

The process of punishment and reformation was effected\nsimultaneously through huge jail building and outdoor penal labour\nprogrammes in Bengal and the Northwest Provinces from the 1830s\non, through the East India Company\u2019s continuation of pre-colonial\nforms of confinement in military forts and other secure locations, and\nthrough the use of penal settlements and colonies across Southeast\nAsia (Andaman Islands, Straits Settlements and Burma) and the\nIndian Ocean (Aden, Mauritius). It was connected also to broader\nassociations between penal sanction, penal labour and the political\neconomy of East India Company expansion: or, to put it simply, to the\ntangled histories of the geographies of confinement and colonization.\nBut also significant is what Narain Sing\u2019s transportation reveals about\nthe social alignments that the colonial administration made with its\nsubjects with respect to shared assumptions about the nature and\nmeaning of, and the expectations attached to, military rank, social\nstatus and most significantly masculinity and honour. I have already\ntouched upon these in my discussion of Narain Sing\u2019s conduct during\nthe Kaleegunga mutiny. However, they also informed some of the\nunintended outcomes of transportation \u2013 not as the practice of social\nrupture, social levelling and shame intended by the judicial authorities\nin India, but as a hierarchical space within and through which new\nculturally and otherwise ambitious identities could emerge in distant\noverseas locations.\nThe movement of prisoners and transportation convicts across the\nIndian mainland and around the Bay of Bengal connected Company\nsettlements together geographically and created new social networks\nand routes for the flow of information. It is tempting to imply that\nconvictmobility constituted a sort of borderless penal cosmopolitanism\nin this respect. But, as we will see, an analysis of Narain Sing\u2019s\ntransportation reveals something of the multiple fractures within oft-\ntimes competing discourses around convictism in and across South\nand Southeast Asia, and challenges the temptation to represent\nIndian prisons and penal settlements collectively or commonly as a\ndiscrete colonial space.

Convicts could climb the rungs of\nthe penal ladder to achieve positions of relative authority, overseeing\nthe work of their fellow convicts. This was much to the disgust of a\nsteady stream of colonial commentators who felt that for Indians this\nprospect rendered transportation preferable to incarceration on the\nmainland, if not easier than other forms of labour service or bondage,\nor even the insecurities of paid work.\nNarain Sing\u2019s transportation highlights a second form of social\ndifferentiation in the penal settlements too, that produced not out\nof penal service but out of the status and position of individuals\nprior to trial and conviction. On occasion, favourable treatment\nsuch as exemption from labour or fetters was written explicitly\ninto sentences of transportation. But it was also created out of the\nlimited resources of Company officials in managing convicts, and their\ndaily encounters with the felons under their charge. The differential\nexperience of transportation convicts in this respect had much in\ncommon with the informal practices associated with the management\nof prisoners in Indian jails,46 and so reveals something of the tensions\nof transportation as both a cosmopolitan and an intensely local penal\npractice.\nDuring the first half of the nineteenth century, the overwhelming\nmajority of transportation convicts from India were found guilty of\ncivil offences, usually involving violence against the person or murder,\nbut sometimes burglary, robbery and gang robbery, or forgery. Narain\nSing, however, was part of a small minority of convicts who were\ntransported within the context of violent collective resistance to the\nexpansion of the East India Company\u2019s territorial control, or the\nspecifically political offences of rebellion or treason. For example,\nat the turn of the nineteenth century, among transported convict\noffenders were Chuar rebels from the tribal areas of Midnapur in\nthe Bengal Presidency, in rebellion against the British.47 In the\nsouth, in 1802 the Company shipped Poligar rebels overseas from\nTirunelveli District to Penang.48 The British also shipped Konds from\n46 David Arnold, \u2018The Contested Prison: India 1790\u20131945\u2019, in Frank Diko\u00a8tter and\nIan Brown, eds, Cultures of Confinement: A History of the Prison in Africa, Asia and Latin\nAmerica, London, Hurst, 2007, 147\u2013184.\n47 Clare Anderson, Convicts in the Indian Ocean: transportation from South Asia to\nMauritius, 1815\u201353, Basingstoke, Macmillan, 2000, 31\u201332.\n48 TNSA Madras Judicial Vol. 188A: J.

Thus whilst some faced transportation other Poligar rebels\nwere banished from their home districts of Coimbatore and Madura\nduring the early 1800s.52 Santals were removed from the Santal\nParganas and incarcerated in jails across the Bengal Presidency after\n1855.53 Wajid Ali Shah, the deposed King of Awadh, was detained\nin Garden Reach in Calcutta from 1856 to 1859, after the British\ntook the opportunity to arrest him when he fell ill in the city on the\nway to London to plead the case against British annexation of the\nstate. Sentences of transportation and banishment were often viewed\nas more appropriate than capital punishment because they ruptured\nnetworks of political \u2018intrigue\u2019 without risking the elevation of rebels to\nheroic status or martyrdom. At the same time, they were one element\nof a colonial propaganda of merciful and benevolent government in\nthe years before the Great Revolt of 1857\u20131858.\nIn the aftermath of the Anglo\u2013Sikh Wars, the Company employed\nthis sort of mixed penal economy \u2013 exile, banishment and trans-\nportation \u2013 to remove its military opponents from the Panjab.

He had been sentenced not\nto transportation per se, but to \u2018life banishment across seas\u2019, effectively\nthe same sentence, in October 1849.56\nTransportation overseas offered the potential for radical changes\nin identity, for it presented an opportunity for individuals\nand communities to reposition themselves according to new\nhierarchies, opportunities and constraints. Despite perceptions of the\ndangerousness and rebelliousness in India, both convicted thugs and\nSantals, for instance, became desirable convicts in the Burmese penal\nsettlements. In1839, CommissionerA.Boglewrote that hehad agreed\nto receive thug convicts in Arakan after his counterpart in Tenasserim\nhad persuaded him that they were quiet and well behaved.57 By 1848,\nthere were 133 thugs in the Convict Police, and they were employed as\noverseers, orderlies and hospital attendants.58 Though the privilege\nwas initially denied to them, it was not long before the Company\nagreed to grant thug requests to live at large after serving sixteen\nyears, like other convicts in Burma.59 Perhaps this transformation lay\nin the practice of thuggee as a form of criminality bound up with\nmilitary practice and thus in thugs\u2019 acceptance of a social hierarchy\nthat was palatable to incorporative techniques of penal (as inmilitary)\nmanagement.60 It might also have reflected something of ordinary\nconvicts\u2019 views of thugs as hardened offenders not to be crossed.

This tribal community\n(the largest in India) became feted for its lack of caste strictures,\nand its associated willingness to eat all types of food and to perform\nall types of labour. Santals possessed what the colonial authorities\nreferred to at the time as \u2018the wisdom of the barbarian\u2019.61\nJust as Narain Sing\u2019s experience of criminal trial and incarceration\nin India was atypical, his experience of transportation was quite\ndifferent to that of an ordinary chain gang convict. He arrived in\nMoulmein in December 1851, and does not seem to have been put\nto outdoor labour as was the norm. He was transferred to the more\nsoutherly penal establishment at Mergui just over a year later, where\nhe appears to have impressed the colonial establishment with his\nstoicism. A range of officers produced testimonials on his behalf. J.\nStevenson, the officer in charge of the jail, wrote that although his\nlot was painful, he did not complain or show discontent. Rather, he\nstayed away from the other convicts, and complied with the jail rules\nand the orders of the jailer. D.

By his own admission, Stevenson knew \u2018very little\u2019 of\nNarain Sing\u2019s \u2018character and deeds in Hindoostan\u2019, and could promise\nonly limited surveillance over him, especially when he was out in the\ndistricts.66\nAt about the same time as Narain Sing was transported to Burma,\ntwo other Panjab rebels were sent into transportation \u2013 to Singapore \u2013\n\u2018Saint soldier\u2019 Bhai Maharaj Singh and his disciple Khurruck Sing.\nThese two men are unquestionably the best-known Indian convicts\ntransported overseas in the years before 1857, and in popular\nmemory today Maharaj Singh in particular is remembered as both\na spiritual leader and hero of Sikh nationalism.

Vansittart was worried that if he starved to death, he\nwould be \u2018cherished by all posterity\u2019, precisely the effect that he hoped\nsafe captivity would avoid.70 Maharaj Sing gave up his hunger strike,\nand in May 1850 he was transported to Singapore with Khurruck Sing\non the ship Mahomed Shaw.71\nOn arrival, the men were lodged in Singapore jail, and government\nconfiscated their personal effects, including bangles, a kirpan (dagger)\nand ring, as well as a conch shell, which were used by Sikhs commonly\nin religious ceremonies.72 A few years later in 1853, Khurruck Sing\nexpressed a desire to convert to Christianity. Despite his interest in\nreading anddiscussing theBible, his requestwas dismissed as a shallow\nattempt at liberation, most particularly because he drew parallels\nbetween Jesus Christ and the \u2018Great Seikh Gooroo\u2019. Moreover, as\nGovernor-General Dalhousie put it, it was hardly surprising that he\ncould speak of Jesus \u2013 and otherOldTestament figures likeMoses \u2013 for\nany Muslim would be able to do the same.

He moved in with\naman he described as an old Parsi friend calledCursetjeeMuncherjee,\nwho had been a merchant and spice planter in Bencoolen. When news\nof the Indian Revolt reached Singapore in the middle of 1857, the\nport was in a fever. By the month of August rumours of an uprising\norganized by the 3,000 or so convicts then in the Straits Settlements\nwere circulating, and the merchant community was nervous that\nIndian troops and the Chinese community would join them in mutiny.\nIt found little reassurance in Governor Blundell\u2019s refusal to ban the\nconvicts\u2019 usual Mohurrum celebrations in the streets outside their\nbarracks. It was in this context that Khurruck Sing \u2013 by now called the\nSeikh by Europeans and the Rajah by free Indians and convicts \u2013 came\nunder especial scrutiny. Two convicts, Dimshun Jamsetjee (a Parsi)\nand Budoo, claimed during an interview with the Resident Councillor\nthatKhurruck Sing intended to attack theEuropeans in the settlement\nwhile they were in church, though it was far from clear that there was\nan organized plot. A search of his house revealed nothing. \u2018Khurruck\nSing is a great sensualist\u2019, Governor Blundell wrote. \u2018The consequence\nis that he is frequently drunk and in that state he may have given\nutterance to abuse and have imagined scenes where the power has\nchanged from our hands into his\u2019.

According\nto local commissioner A. Fytche, the Indian convicts in Moulmein\nwere \u2018extremely agitated\u2019 about themainland uprising. The European\ncommunity fell into a panic, seeking refuge on ships in the harbour and\nstockpiling arms and ammunition. In July 1857, 50 Indian convicts\narrived in the settlement. Though they had not been convicted of\nmutiny offences, they brought with them what Fytche described as\nexaggerated stories about events in the Northwest Provinces. Like\nthe European population of Singapore, he was worried about the\nprospect of an incendiary combination between convicts, jail guards,\ntown police, and the free Muslim community of the town. With no\nEuropean infantry and only a small military force from Madras at\nhis disposal, Fytche ordered the return of the convicts to the jail at\nAlipur.79\nIn the context of widespread military and civil revolt in India and\nfears about its spread into Southeast Asia, it is hardly surprising\nthat Narain Sing\u2019s 1857\u20131858 petitions for liberation fell on deaf\nears. However, in early 1860 when calm had been restored and the\ntransfer of power from East India Company to British Crown effected,\nthe officiating commissioner of Tenasserim and Martaban Provinces,\nHenry Hopkinson, recommended that Narain Sing be allowed to live\noutside the jail under police surveillance.

Clementina\nBenthall, in a diary of her visit to Moulmein jail with her magistrate\nhusband Edward, had written ten years earlier that many convicts\nbecame jail wardens: \u2018the system has answered well \u2013 these being\nsome of the best Policemen and settlers\u2019.82 But his transformation was\nalso enabled by the opportunities presented through broader social\nchanges associated with the Great Revolt of 1857\u20131858. It is to a\ndiscussion of those shifts that we will now turn.\nTransformations in Identity\nThe transportation of Narain Sing provides a window into the\npunishment of \u2018political\u2019 offences during thefirst half of the nineteenth\ncentury, on the layered nature of penal settlements, and on shared\nassumptions about honourable or gentlemanly conduct between men\nof rank. It also offers insights into broader shifts around social\nidentity as the British expanded into the northwest of the Indian\nsubcontinent.

But\nwe know rather less about the roots of this shift in representation \u2013\nfrom treacherous to loyal \u2013 in the decade between war and rebellion\n(c. 1845\u20131857), when British and Indians alike made the first\nsystematic contact with Panjabi communities. I would like to argue\nthat jails, convict ships and convict barracks were crucial sites for this\npeculiarly colonial encounter. They were spaces in which men and\nwomen from a range of geographical, cultural, religious and linguistic\nbackgrounds were crammed together, and forced to share the iron and\nbrassware, gourd shells and pottery associatedwith the intimate bodily\npractices of drinking and eating. Liquid and solid waste also mingled\nwith the fluids of sickness \u2013 vomit, sweat, blood and tears \u2013 producing\nconfinement as one of the most intimate spaces of colonization.84\nDuring the 1840s and into the 1850s British and Indians alike stood\nin awe of Panjabi military prowess and continuing resistance to British\nannexation. Their perceptions were grounded in the fierce military\nbattles of the Anglo\u2013Sikh Wars, and alleged Sikh \u2018cruelty\u2019, but later\nevents were significant too. Little known historically is what even the\nBritish described at the time as a \u2018massacre\u2019 in Agra jail in April 1850,\na bloody and scandalous affair that followed the incarceration in the\ncity of a substantial body of Panjabi prisoners \u2013 over 250 \u2013 convicted\nin the wake of the Anglo\u2013Sikh wars. This is what happened. A few days\nafter the prisoners arrived in Agra, allegedly a small group of them\n\u2018murmured\u2019 to the jail guard about the quantity and quality of their\nfood. The incident quickly escalated; a guard struck a prisoner, the\nPanjabis retaliated, and guards killed or wounded 75 prisoners, many\nafter they had sought refuge in their cells. The investigating judge was\nfurious about their brutal response, describing a scene of the prisoners\n\u2018crying aloud for mercy, and cowering together, in the extremity of\nmortal terror, in such nooks of the ward as promised the best shelter\n83 Thomas R.

Overcrowding and a shortage of water may have\nprovoked the uprising, though as several convicts later testified it had\nbeen planned at least a week beforehand.93 Led by convicts from the\nPanjab, it was extremely violent. The convicts murdered the captain,\nchief and second mates (all Englishmen) and over half of the crew\nand guards: 31 men in total. They ransacked the ship, destroying\nthe convicts\u2019 descriptive rolls and log book, ran the ship aground,\nand landed between Rangoon and Tavoy in the mistaken belief that\nthe region was outside British control. The mutiny quickly took on\nthe characteristics of a military campaign. Convict Soor Singh put on\nthe captain\u2019s coat and boots, and the gold necklace, sword and sash\nbelonging to the subadar of the guard. He armed six other convicts,\ncalling them \u2018his sepoys\u2019.94 The mutinous party made its way to the\n\u2018BurmaRajah\u2019 with the intention of offering him their services against\nthe British. According to convict-turned-informer Kurrim Singh:\nThey all went into the Rajah\u2019s Cutcherry. The Rajah salaamed and gave\nSoor Singh a chair to sit on, there were several interpreters there. The\nRajah asked Soor Singh where he had come from and where he was going to.\nSoor Singh said he was a sikh from Lahore and had come with 175 men to\nhelp the Burma Rajah. They had some conversation and the Rajah wishing,\nas he said, to call all the rest of Soor Singh\u2019s men, Soor Singh gave him one\nof his party to shew [sic] where they were and the Rajah sent 25 armed\nBurmese with him.

Colville declaring it the most serious case that he had ever tried.97\nThe court ordered that most of the defendants be transported to serve\nout their original sentence, but unlike other convicts in the Straits\nSettlements they would not be eligible to earn remission of sentence\nand would remain in the fifth class, kept at hard labour for life. Four\nconvicts were sentenced to death.98 During the trial, the divisions\nbetween the convicts emerged. A minority of convicts who referred\nto themselves either as Bengalis, \u2018Deswalees\u2019, or Hindustanis claimed\nthat they had nothing to do with themutiny, and that it was largely the\nwork of men they called \u2018Sikhs\u2019. Moreover, they said that the \u2018Sikhs\u2019\nhad imprisoned them below deck after the outbreak99 and, when the\nship ran aground, they had made them carry their luggage.100\nThe complexity of social manoeuvring on board the Clarissa ran\ndeeper still, for I suspect that the opportunity for mutiny was created\nout of a fatal misjudgement on the part of the captain. One of the\nguards testified that he had employed one of the convicts to clean\nhis swords and muskets. The subadar had complained, but the captain\nhad told him \u2018to hold his tongue\u2019.101 This was a dreadful mistake\non his part, for he had chosen a man described on his descriptive\nindent as a \u2018desperate character\u2019 and requiring a special guard.102 The\ncaptain\u2019s miscalculation was almost certainly based on a sense that he\nhad more in common with him than the usual convict shipments of\nordinary Indians in their threadbare cotton dhotis and turbans. After\nall, he was a military man of high rank and status, dressed like his\ncompatriots in pantaloons and a smart red jacket, or in the words of\none of the sepoys on board, one of several \u2018fine-looking fellows\u2019.103 In\nMay 1856, after the surviving Clarissa convicts were sent on to the\nStraits Settlements, Resident Councillor of Malacca H.

The presence of the\nClarissa convicts \u2013 according to him \u2018notoriously desperate characters\u2019\n\u2013 did not ease matters.104 He had already transferred three of them\nto Singapore \u2013 Khan Moolla (from Peshwar), Utter Sing (Lahore) and\nMahtub (Multan), claiming they had \u2018a pernicious influence over those\nof their own nation\u2019.105\nThe Panjabis\u2019 fearsome reputation had important implications\nwith respect to colonial management strategies in the decades that\nfollowed. As well as employing Panjabis in the Bengal Army in large\nnumbers, from the 1870s the British recruited them for service as\npolicemen across the Empire. Thomas Metcalf has drawn attention to\nthewidespreadBritish view of the police in SoutheastAsia as physically\nintimidating, arrogant, and overbearing, traits that according to him\nin no small measure assured their success. British Resident at Pahang\nHugh Clifford wrote that Sikhs were \u2018possessed of as absolute a\nconviction of his own superiority to the men of any other race \u2013\nEuropeans alone excepted \u2013 as is the White Man himself. He is quite\nfrank about this opinion, and he is accustomed to act upon it at all\ntimes\u2019. And, \u2018To other Asiatics he is as arrogant and overbearing as\ncan well be conceived, and he displays none of the tact which helps to\nmake a European less hated for his airs of superiority than he might\nbe\u2019.106\nOf particular interest is Metcalf\u2019s invocation of the changing\nmeaning of the category of \u2018Sikh\u2019. He argues that in colonial\nsettlements across the Indian Ocean it became a marker of particular\nsocial characteristics, most especially some degree of shared cultural\nvalues with and loyalty to the British colonial regime. As such, it had\nthe potential to become a remarkably wide descriptive tag. This is\nhugely relevant to our social understanding of Narain Sing, for convict\nand jail records reveal that upon his conviction he had not described\nhimself as a Sikh, but as a Hindu Brahmin, \u2018in service\u2019.107 Moreover,\nas we have seen, colonial administrators and north Indians described\nindiscriminately all Panjabi prisoners and convicts as \u2018Sikhs\u2019 during\nthe 1850s, as evidenced during their recollections of the mutinies and\n104 IOR P\/145\/42 (Bengal Judicial 19 June 1856): H.

At this time, the appellation marked a\ndeep sense of nervousness and unease; only later on did it have more\npositive connotations, at least as far as the British were concerned.\nHigh-caste Narain Sing\u2019s employment as a soldier in the 1840s\nPanjab was typical of the socially incorporative military regime of\nRanjit Singh, in a context where religious identities were fluid. In the\nsteady stream of petitions that he presented to government, however,\nmarkedly after the 1857 Revolt, he always described himself as a Sikh\n(or \u2018Seik\u2019). I see this as a deliberate and careful alignment on his part\nwith shifting British views. In the 1860s the colonial administration\nviewed Sikhs as loyal colonial subjects, part of a larger discursive\ntransformation that was effected through their role in assisting British\ntroops during 1857\u20131858. The British no longer saw Sikhs (all Panjabi\ncommunities collapsed into a single category) as treacherous and\ncruel, but as trustworthy and faithful. Narain Sing was surely aware of\nthis when he told the officiating commissioner of Tenasserim that he\nhad received a letter from one of his sisters, describing her marriage\nto the rajah of Jheend, who had supported the British in 1857. No\ndoubt this was part of a broader effort to provide the government with\nassurance of his loyalty.108\n\u2018My Lord\u2019, Narain Sing wrote later in 1863, \u2018the Seiks, my\ncountrymen, served the British in their greatest strait, nor is it for\nyour Petitioner to say what the result might have been had Delhi been\nassaulted without their aid, or had they, like the faithless soldiery of\nBengal, also turned against the British\u2019.

It based its\ncalculation on what it viewed as their relatively humble circumstances\nat the time of the Anglo\u2013Sikh Wars.110\nConclusion\nIn concluding this piece I would like to return to the issue of\nNarain Sing\u2019s near anonymity in post-colonial historiography, for\nit seems related to continuing resistance to the British after the\nannexation of the Panjab in 1849 as well the politics of his shifting\nidentity. Narratives of colonial India have most usually stressed the\nincorporation of the Panjab into the British state in the aftermath\nof annexation, and its loyalty to the British in 1857. Continued\nPanjabi hostility to colonial governance and penal confinement in the\nintervening years interrupts the idea that this was a smooth transition.\nMoreover, Narain Sing\u2019s strategic use of a \u2018Sikh\u2019 identity hints at the\nbroader processes at work during the 1850s and 1860s with respect\nto British relations with the Panjab. Perhaps because his identity was\nnot specifically religious, unlike his fellow transportees Bhai Maharaj\nSingh and Khurruck Singh, Narain Sing has not been anchored to a\nSikh nationalist perspective in any meaningful way either.\nHowever, despite these historiographical elisions, Narain Sing\u2019s\nelevation to head constable in Moulmein had other long-term\nconsequences. In Singapore, the convict warder system that was\nestablished when the port incorporated a penal settlement continued\nthrough a pattern of mainland Indian employment in the prison\nservice into the 1970s.111 Speculatively, extrapolating from Narain\nSing\u2019s experience of penal labour and employment and Benthall\u2019s\ndescription of the transformation of convicts into jail warders, the\nsame continuities can be found in colonial Burma. The British\nrecruited Indians for police and jail service well after the demise of\nits penal settlements in the 1860s.
