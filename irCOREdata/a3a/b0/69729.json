Introduction\nMobile commerce (m-commerce) can be generally\ndefined as a set of business activities conducted over\nmobile and wireless networks using applications on\nhandheld devices. M-commerce not only includes e-\ncommerce applications, but also many new and\ninnovative applications, such as those shown in Figure\n1, that are only possible on the mobile and wireless\nnetworks [1]. The particular features of mobile\nnetworks that will enable these innovative applications\nare:\n\u2022 mobility;\n\u2022 personalization;\n\u2022 and ability to be always online.\nThe personalization of mobile devices has already\nappeared in the different hardware configuration and\nwith the advent of standardized operating systems and\nlocation based information we can also personalize the\ninternal applications [2].\nMobile Entertainment\nServices\nWireless and\nMobile\nNetworks\nMobile Auctions\nand Games\nMobile Information\/\nAdvertising\nProduct Location Tracking\nUser Mobile\nBanking\nMobile Financial\nApplications\nSpecific\nusers\nAuction\/game\nserver\nMicro payments\nfor products\nand services\nSpecific\nlocations\nUser\npreferences\nAdvertising\nDatabase\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0007\n\u000b\f\u0002\r\u0006\u0007\u000e\u000b\u000f\u000f\u0006\u0005\u0010\u0006\u0007\u0011\u0010\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0012\u0002\u0006\u0014\u0007\nSome applications may be very location-centric with\nthis becoming the core of the entire product, for\nexample, mapping applications and tools to find the\nshortest route and the closest restaurant. Other\napplications may use location information to provide\ninformation or advertisements relevant to a particular\nuser at their current location, for example, suggesting\nmy favorite type of restaurant in a town were I am\nvisiting along with suitable place to park. Such location\nbased information is expected [3] to have a significant\ninfluence on user behavior.\nProviding location information to facilitate these\nservices is far from straight forward and often requires\nsignificant changes in software and hardware to\nproduce high degrees of localization. In this paper we\npresent a solution that can provide location based\ninformation\/advertisements at an accuracy of around\n10m to any current mobile phone equipped with\nBluetooth technology. Furthermore, whilst other\nsystems using Bluetooth have been proposed [4], [5],\nProceedings of the International Conference on Mobile Business (ICMB\u201905) \n0-7695-2367-6\/05 $20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Restrictions apply.\n[6] they utilize client side software whilst this system\nrequires no software to be installed on the phone and\nwill allow users to instantaneously \u2018opt-in\u2019 to the\nservice.\nIn order that we can place the systems in context we\nshall discuss more general mechanisms for providing\nlocation based systems in section two along with their\nperformance constraints. In section three we will\ndescribe the generic Bluetooth system for providing a\nrange of services before highlighting its use in\nparticular scenarios in section four. Section five defines\nthe implemented application design for the scenarios\ndiscussed in section four before we draw our final\nconclusions in section six.\n2. Providing the Location of a Mobile User\nAlthough we often consider the requirement for\nproviding the location of a mobile user as a new\nproblem, in fact all mobile systems effectively track a\nuser\u2019s whereabouts at the cellular level. Each cell site\nhas a unique Cell-ID which enables the system to\nlocate a mobile user so that it can route calls to the\ncorrect location. While the Cell-ID is easily found\n(typically acquisition around 3 seconds) its accuracy is\nentirely dependent on the size of the cell. Cell sizes\nvary dependent on the capacity requirements of a\nparticular geographical area of coverage and for 3G\nsystems this could range anywhere between cell radius\nof 100m to 10 km. Therefore accuracy would be\nextremely variable although it would require no\nmodifications to either the mobile handset or\ninfrastructure.\nFinding the location of a specific mobile user with a\nmuch greater degree of accuracy requires systems that\nare based on the measurement of pre-defined\nparameters of a received signal that enables the\nposition of the mobile user to be inferred. The signal\nitself could be one used for the mobile communication\nitself or specifically provided for location\nmeasurement. This signal coupled with the\nmeasurement parameters and the accuracy required has\na direct effect on the complexity required for the\nsolution. Although the measured parameters could be\neither based on Time of Arrival (TOA) or Angle of\nArrival (AOA), TOA systems dominate the solutions\ncurrently being considered and can be based absolute\nof relative time. These are the ones considered in detail\nas part of this section.\nLocation finding is a relative exercise, in other\nwords the location of the mobile user must be estimated\nagainst some known framework. This framework could\nbe elements such as the locations of the base stations of\na mobile phone network or the satellites of the Global\nPositioning System (GPS). Each system will provide\ndifferent levels of performance and capabilities as we\nshall discuss in the following sub-sections but both\nrepresent significant improvements over the simple\nCell ID system.\n2.1. Enhanced Observed Time Difference\nThe Enhanced Observed Time Difference (E-OTD)\nsolution is based on the measurement of signals\noriginating from numerous cell sites which contain\ninformation on differential propagation distances (this\nis often referred to as a Time Difference of Arrival\n(TDOA) mechanism, when synchronized to a common\ntime base. In GSM systems where transmissions are not\nsynchronized additional network devices called\nLocation Measurement Units (LMUs) can be utilized.\nThese devices measure TDOA at numerous sites and\nthen calculate correction values. These values are\ncollected and used to enable correction of the raw\nTDOA measurements. These corrections can be sent to\neither the mobile handset or the centralized\ninfrastructure, as shown in Figure 2., depending where\nthe calculation is performed. Generally, the number of\nLMUs will be less than the number of cell sites and can\nbe located such that they maximize the precision of the\nmeasurement which means that means they will often\nnot be co-located with cell sites. The location\nmeasurement could normally be made in around 5\nseconds and achieve an accuracy of 50 to 125m.\nHowever, if the line of sight measurement is\nunavailable and\/or the signal undergoes multipath,\nsystem accuracy is severely compromised. Although\nnew hardware would have to be employed only a\nsoftware update is required at the handset.\nLocation\nCalculation and\nControl\nServing\nSite\nNeighbour\nSite #1\nNeighbour\nSite #2\nHandset\nSynchronised Sites\nor LMUs\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\u0015\t\u0007\u0016\u0017\u0018\u0019\u0007\u001a\u000b\r\u0004\u0012\u0002\u000b\u001b\u0007\nProceedings of the International Conference on Mobile Business (ICMB\u201905) \n0-7695-2367-6\/05 $20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

GPS or Assisted-GPS\nTo the layman the obvious solution to the problem\nof providing an accurate position of the mobile user is\nto fit a GPS receiver unit within the mobile handset.\nHowever, this implementation would have a number of\nmajor restrictions such as the fact that no indoor\ncoverage would be available and it has an acquisition\ntime in the region of 10-60 seconds. Further, many\nurban environments would also restrict a mobile users\n\u2018view\u2019 of the satellites and it would be unreliable in\nsuch situations. Assisted GPS systems overcome some\nof these limitations by using knowledge obtained from\nthe fixed infrastructure to reduce acquisition time down\nto approximately 5 seconds and possibly provide\nindoor accuracy to within 50m. However, as with the\nprevious system, multipath and the lack of line of sight\nmeasurement will severely degrade this performance.\nGPS Assist and\nLocation\nCalculation\nHandset\nGPS-SV\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\u001c\t\u0007\u001d\u001e\u001a\u0007\u000b\u0005\u0007\u0011\u0014\u0014\u0002\u0014\u0012\u0006\u001f \u001d\u001e\u001a\u0007\n\u0007\nGPS solutions are the most complex of all requiring\nboth new handsets and additional infrastructure and are\nlikely to be severely detrimental to handset power\nconsumption.\n3. Bluetooth Location Based System\nAlmost every new mobile phone and PDA is now\nequipped with Bluetooth and consumers are becoming\nincreasingly aware of the use and benefits of Bluetooth.\nThis has also resulted in widespread use of Bluetooth\ndongles through which the users can connect their\ndesktop machines to these devices. Other initiatives for\nBluetooth have been seen in the automotive industry\nwhich has begun to include Bluetooth access in cars.\nAccording to sources [7] Bluetooth enabled\nmanufactured products will experience a sales increase\nof 60% between 2003 and 2008.\nIn terms of this location based system it enables\nBluetooth to be used as a means of targeting users with\nspecialized content in a specific area at a given time.\nFor example, users in a supermarket could be informed\nabout a certain discount offer based upon their\npurchasing habits. Such messages can be sent to all the\nusers in the area with a Bluetooth enabled mobile\nhandset or PDA. In order that the system can service a\ndiverse range of users and devices no client side\napplication is required thus nothing has to be installed.\nThe information is presented in a very familiar and\nsimple form of a text message. Figure 4 shows the\nbasic layout of a system for transmitting messages to all\nthe devices in a given area.\nBT message push\nserver\nClient\nClientClient\nClient\nClient\nClient\nClient\nClient\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007!\t\u0007\"#\u0014\u0002\u0010\u0007\"\r\u0004\u0006\u0012\u000b\u000b\u0012$\u0007\n\u0006\u0014\u0014#\u0003\u0006\u0007\u001a%\u0014\u0012\u0006\u000f\nThe system uses Object Exchange Protocol\n(OBEX) over Bluetooth to send the information to\ntarget devices. Licensed by Bluetooth SIG from IrDA,\nOBEX has become even more popular. OBEX is\ntransport neutral, as with the Hypertext Transfer\nProtocol (HTTP), which means that it can work over\nalmost any other transport layer protocol. OBEX is\ndefined as one of the protocols in Bluetooth and sits\nover RS232 Serial Cable Emulation (RFCOMM)\nprotocol [8]. Moreover OBEX is a structured protocol\nwhich provides the functionality to separate data and\ndata attributes. A clear definition of each request can\nbe given which helps distinguish one request from\nanother. Use of other protocols such as RFCOMM or\nLogical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol\n(L2CAP), require the applications sending and\nreceiving information to know how the data is sent and\nwhen to send the reply. Like Extensible Markup\nLanguage (XML) OBEX provides structure to the data\nbeing sent in contrast to other protocols such as\nRFCOMM which basically send bytes.\nThis approach can be used to advocate location\nbased advertisement at point of sale (POS) or perhaps\nhelp\/tour guide systems. In the following section we\nshall discuss two example implementations.\nProceedings of the International Conference on Mobile Business (ICMB\u201905) \n0-7695-2367-6\/05 $20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on January 7, 2009 at 09:25 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\n4. Practical Implementations\nAlthough we presented the basic technology for the\nsystem in the previous section there are operational\nissues dependent on how it is to be employed. The\nfollowing sections highlight further elements which\nmust be incorporated into the design.\n4.1. Supermarket Adverts\/Coupons\nIn this scenario we will consider a system\nimplemented in a supermarket to supply customers with\nthe latest information on products and offers. As it is\nlikely that we have a number of message centers\nscattered throughout the store one of the major\nconcerns is how to make sure that a same message is\nnever sent twice to one device as users may come\nwithin the range of the transmitting device more than\nonce. The range of Bluetooth radio varies between 10 -\n100 meters. Most Bluetooth radio\u2019s only have a limited\nrange of 10 meters, especially mobile handsets.\nReceiving the same information within short intervals\nis likely to irritate the user and will discourage the\nfuture use of the service.\nTo facilitate the fact that devices will roam between\ndifferent locations, and to prevent duplicate messages,\nan integrated backend information system is required.\nFigure [5] shows the conceptual layout for two sites,\neach of them pushing messages (adverts\/coupons) to\nthe users.\nBT message push\nserver\nClient\nClientClient\nClient\nClient\nClient\nClient\nClient\nBT message push\nserver\nClient\nClientClient\nClient\nClient\nClient\nClient\nClient\nStoreDevice\nlist for site 1\nStoreDevice\nlist for site2\nBackend Information System\nSite1 Site2\nRoaming Devices\n\u0007\u0007\n\u0007\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007&\t\u0007'\u000b#\u000f\u0002\u001b\u0003\u0007\u0019\u0006\u0013\u0002\u0010\u0006\u0007\f\u0006\u0012(\u0006\u0006\u001b\u0007\u0019\u0002))\u0006\u0005\u0006\u001b\u0012\u0007\n\"\r\u0004\u0006\u0012\u000b\u000b\u0012$\u0007\u001a\u0002\u0012\u0006\u0014\u0007\nAll devices discovered by individual sites are stored\nin the database along with the site, where they were last\nrecorded, and the messages delivered to them. Each\nBluetooth push server launches a device discovery after\na fixed interval of time. Devices discovered after each\ninquiry are cross checked with the database. Only\nnewly discovered devices are recorded in the database\nand message is sent to these devices. Devices that\nreceived the message in the previous discovery do not\nreceive this message. If a new store promotion message\nis made available in database, next discovery will push\nthe message to all the devices in the area. The messages\nthemselves can be tagged to expire in the database after\na certain amount of time. Within the same scenario the\nshopping center could decide to pick a random device,\nas a lucky winner, to perhaps receive a discount on\ntheir purchase or perhaps a complimentary item. The\nwinner can be notified by a Bluetooth message and this\nmessage is dispatched to one device only.\nSearching for devices at a fixed interval means that\nthe information system could obtain lots of information\nabout different Bluetooth devices. This information can\nbe flushed daily and some of it can be used to enhance\nthe filtering mechanism, for instance a Bluetooth\ndevice appearing on every search or at a particular\nmessage center may belong to a store employee or\nperhaps to an employee of store next door. Such\ninformation can be used to improve the intelligence of\nthe messaging system in identifying potential customers\nand the message to be sent out to them. To improve,\nand better target potential customers, the information\nsystem can be altered to remember the devices who\ntake advantage of the coupon. Upon their next trip to\nthe store these devices can receive an advert targeted at\nthe product for which the coupon was issued last time.\nThere are many similar cases that can be implemented\nwithin this scenario and will be dictated by the store\u2019s\ncurrent sales strategy.\n4.2. Guided Tour\nIn this scenario we consider a system implemented\nat a tourist attraction providing users with key\ninformation about the location. Just like the first\nscenario we will have different message centers but this\ntime they will be sending out different messages\ndepending upon their location within a particular\ntourist spot. The first message could be information\nabout the current location while the later messages may\nbe information about other points of interest at the\nsame spot or perhaps be the one that informs the user\nthat this particular tourist spot will close in certain\namount of time or may provide list to other tourist\nattractions and directions how to get there. For example\nlet us consider this to be implemented at a historic\ncastle. Upon entry to the castle the user can receive a\nbrief history of the castle. Once the user gets within the\nrange of another Bluetooth site, perhaps located at the\ncastle courtyard, the user will receive another message\ngiving a list of places to see within the castle. Since it is\nProceedings of the International Conference on Mobile Business (ICMB\u201905) \n0-7695-2367-6\/05 $20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Restrictions apply.\na large site this implementation will differ from the one\nin the shopping center in terms of how the messages are\ndistributed and managed. Different Bluetooth sites\nwithin the castle will provide different messages to the\nuser. The information system will keep track of the\ndevices discovered by each site and the messages sent\nto them. In this case each Bluetooth message center\nsends out a particular message to the users unlike the\nshopping center scenario where each device is working\naround the same set of messages. The database can be\nrefreshed on a daily basis.\n5. Application Design\nIn section four we outlined two scenarios where a\nsystem, like the one presented in this paper, can be\nimplemented to distribute information to a diverse\nrange of users. In this section we will look at the design\nof the Bluetooth messaging system itself, although the\ninformation system will not be discussed in detail as it\nis beyond the scope of this paper. Figure [6] illustrates\ndifferent processes involved within the entire system to\ndiscover and send messages to users.\nDatabase\nBluetooth Server\nSite\nDiscover\nDevices\nSend MessageUpdate Database\nNew\nMore Messages\nto send\nSleep for\nSpecified short\ninterval\nYes\nNo\nOld\nCheck Discovered\nDevice List\nCheck if device\nis newor old\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007*\t\u0007\u0017\u0013\u0006\u0005#\r\r\u0007\u0011++\r\u0002\u0010#\u0012\u0002\u000b\u001b\u0007\u0001\r\u000b(\u0007\u0019\u0002#\u0003\u0005#\u000f\u0007\nEvery site Bluetooth server initiates a discovery to\nfind all the Bluetooth devices in the area; some filtering\nis done to eliminate devices such as headsets or\ncameras etc. Upon completion of the discovery\nprocess, a list of devices found is passed to the\ndatabase, where all entries are checked. The database\nreturns with a list of devices that are new and those\nwho have already received messages. Based upon these\nresults from the database the system selects appropriate\nmessages to be sent to different target devices. The\nrationale of the entire system can be dictated by the\ninformation system at the back end of this messaging\nsystem. Device filtration takes place at Bluetooth\ndiscovering site. Devices such as headsets, cameras etc\nare not included in the request to the Database server.\nThe Database server periodically receives an individual\nlist from each Bluetooth site associated with it. Each\nlist consists of Bluetooth addresses of the discovered\ndevices along with the ID of the discovering site.\nFigure [7] shows some of the basic functions that the\napplication server must perform on the database.\nShopping center\nDevice List\nDevice List\nDevice List\nSort Devices\nAdd to DB with\ndiscovering site\nAlready in DB\nNew\nExisting device\nExisting device, new site\nUpdate\nDiscovering\nSite\nSend first\nMessage\nRecover last Message ID\nChoose nextmessage\nto send\nGenerate individual lists\nbased upon discovering site\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007,\t\u0007\n\u0006\u0014\u0014#\u0003\u0006\u0007\u001a\u0002\u0012\u0006\u0014\u0007-\u001b\u0012\u0006\u0005#\u0010\u0012\u0002\u001b\u0003\u0007(\u0002\u0012$\u0007\n\u0019#\u0012#\f#\u0014\u0006\u0007\nAfter receiving the list of discovered devices in the\narea the server sorts them out into three groups namely;\nnew devices, existing devices discovered by a different\nmessage center and existing devices within the range of\nthe same message center that discovered them last time.\nAt this point as seen from Figure [7] the system adds a\nmessage to each device group. Newly discovered\ndevices are sent the first message or promotion of the\nday while the other two categories receive or not\nreceive a message based upon the last message ID,\nwhich was sent to them. Before message centers can\nreceive the lists, database updates the message ID for\nevery device currently under consideration. The\napplication server once again sends out separate lists\nspecific to each site with the message they are to push\nto the target device. Based upon these lists, message\ncenters send out information to the users. On a given\nday users never receive a duplicate message whilst\nmaking sure that every new device coming into the\nregion shall receive those messages.\nThis has been implemented in Java. MySQL has\nbeen used as the database and PHP has been used to\nimplement the server side logic.

For example during device discovery all\ndevices shall be shown; both new and the ones\ndiscovered in the previous run.\nTo implement this system aveLink Bluetooth stack\nwas used from Atinav [10]. There are other stacks\navailable that have a JSR82 implementation but not all\nof them support OBEX. There are two basic\napproaches that one can take to implement such s\nsystem; use a Java API with Bluetooth stack built in or\nuse Java API that uses an external stack. One of the\nmajor reasons aveLink was selected for this application\nwas the fact that it possesses a fully implemented and\nself contained Java Bluetooth stack. Other choices in\nthe same category can be Harold [11] or Java\nBluetooth [12] but neither of them are a complete\nimplementation of JSR82 and do not support OBEX.\nAlthough all of them are platform independent but\nHarold and Java Bluetooth stacks require javax.comm\n[13] to be installed on the machine running these\nstacks.\nOptions in Java API accessing external stacks are\nBlue Cove [14], JBlueZ [15], avetanaBluetooth [16]\nand Impronto Developer Kit [17]. Apart from\navetanaBluetooth the rest are OS dependent. JBlueZ\nworks with BlueZ stack for Linux and Blue Cove is\ncurrently available for Windows only. Impronto\nDeveloper Kit is available for Linux at the moment\nwhile avetanaBluetooth is not only available for\nWindows and Linux but also for Mac OS. From the\noptions considered only Impronto Developer Kit and\navetanaBluetooth support OBEX, which in the light of\nabove discussion makes avetanaBluetooth a viable\nchoice if planning to run the system on an external\nstack.\nIn our view aveLink and avetanaBluetooth are the\nmost suitable choices to go with because not only do\nthey provide support for OBEX but they also have a\nversion available for Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME)\nwhich can be used to add on functionality to provide\ninformation as to \u201cWho\u2019s around\u201d along with \u201cWhat\u2019s\naround\u201d.

In this case the\nBluetooth message center shall inform the information\nsystem that a particular device does not wish to receive\npromotions.\n6. Further Work & Conclusions\nObviously there are many other scenarios than those\nwe have already mentioned and the proposed system\ncould easily be adapted to a number of other possible\nuses. One of the great benefits of this system is the fact\nthat it can be deployed without requiring the users to do\nanything more complicated than switch on their\nBluetooth capability and accept the message although\nthis limits the content to text based messages. We have\nalready seen through the wide scale adoption of SMS\nthat text only communication is perfectly acceptable as\nit is the information content that is important.\nAccording to Barwise & Strong [18], in SMS m-\nadvertising, 81% of the test subjects viewed all the\nmessages before deleting them and 77% of them did\nthat as soon as they received the advertisement. This\npredicts a healthy response from the users for this\nsystem. Since this information is being delivered at\nPOS, users are more likely to take advantage of the\noffer as well.\nThe proposed system is targeted towards personal\ndevices such as mobile handsets which users wear\nalmost everywhere and all the time. Users do not want\nto receive spam or receive information without their\npermission. With the system presented in this paper\nProceedings of the International Conference on Mobile Business (ICMB\u201905) \n0-7695-2367-6\/05 $20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

They can simply turn off Bluetooth\nreception before entering a shopping center or any\nother place that advertises the fact that users can\nreceive promotional information through Bluetooth. A\nsimilar example is of Mobiluck [19] which permits its\nusers to communicate and exchange information with\neach other through Bluetooth. Many commercial areas\ndisplay the unique Mobiluck sign which can notify\nusers to either switch on or off their Bluetooth\nreception. Moreover with our proposed system users\nhave the choice not to accept an incoming connection\nrequest.\nFurther, as the more advanced location positioning\nsystems like those described in section two are added\nto mobile phones and supporting infrastructure this\nsystem could feed the vital indoor and urban\ninformation to reduce acquisition time and improve\naccuracy. With this enhancement a much broader range\nof LBS can be made available to the users at a variety\nof locations. User profiles can be made accessible\nbetween different shopping centers or it could even be\nimplemented as portable platform, for instance in a\nbackpack that allows the wearer to transmit\nadvertisements to public at concerts or fairs.\nNeighbour\nSite # 2\nNeighbour\nSite # 1\nSynchronised Sites or LMU's\nIndoor\nEnvironment\nLocation Calculation\nand Control\nServing\nSite\nBluetooth\nHotspots in an\nindoor environment\n\u0007\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b2\t\u0007\"\r\u0004\u0006\u0012\u000b\u000b\u0012$\u0007\u000e\u000b\u000f+\r\u0006\u000f\u0006\u001b\u0012\u0002\u001b\u0003\u0007\u0016\u0017\u0018\u0019\u0007\u0002\u001b\u0007\n-\u001b\u001f\u000b\u000b\u0005\u0007\u0016\u001b\u0013\u0002\u0005\u000b\u001b\u000f\u0006\u001b\u0012\u0014\u0007\nWith PDA sales declining [20] and mobile\nconnections increasing our system is a viable option for\nm-advertisements.
