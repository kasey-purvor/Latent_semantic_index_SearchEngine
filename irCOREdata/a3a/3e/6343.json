A previous editorial of this journal paid tribute to\nDavid's work and provided a review of some of his research interests (Conole, 2001). The\nseven articles in this issue are from friends and colleagues who worked with David over the\nyears. Some worked with David for only a relatively short time; others are lifelong friends.\nThe authors represent internationally recognized experts in their field and come from all\ncorners of the earth. This in itself is a testament to David's significant contribution to\nlearning technology research. The authors have submitted papers which in some way align\nwith David's own research work or report on joint work done by the authors in partnership\nwith him.\nThe issue begins with a review by Conole of the current status of learning technology,\nwhich benchmarks current developments against the visionary concept of a Peripatetic\nElectronic Teacher outlined by Squires only a few years ago (Squires, 1999) and discusses\nthe extent to which this vision has been realized. This article attempts to provide a\ntaxonomy for learning technology and outlines current areas of research activity. The\nremaining articles in this issue provide an excellent sample of work across these areas and\nform a valuable snapshot of the current status of learning technology research.\nAdaptive hypermedia is an area of increasing research interest and importance. The article\nby Ng, Hall et al. reports on the application and evaluation of adaptive hypermedia\ntechniques, whilst Kemp, Davis et al. report on an evaluation of the shift from classroom\ntutor to hypertext adviser.\nDeveloping engaging and interactive learning materials, particularly ones that provide\ninteractive and authentic learning opportunities, is a major area of activity. A particular\nsubset of this is the development and use of models and simulations in teaching and\nlearning. Riley reports on a pioneering initiative - the Computers in the Curriculum\n2\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nProject - for which David Squires was Director of Science in the 1980s, as well as more\nrecent developments in systems modelling within geographic and business education.\nStudent assessment and evaluation are major areas of concern as we attempt to\nunderstand the benefits and impact of Information and Communication Technologies\n(ICT) in education and distil examples of good practice. Macht and Preece in their paper\nconsider the issue of how accurately instructors judge students' attitudes online.\nFinally, the remaining two papers consider aspects of associated student support\nmechanisms and the learning environment. McDougal reports on the development of\ntechnology-supported environments for learning through cognitive conflict, whilst\nJameson reports on work that she did with David Squires looking at graduate supervisors\nas advanced expert coaches.\nTo conclude, we hope you feel, as we do, that this issue acts by way of a celebration of\nDavid's work to form a special tribute to him and his family.\nGr\u00e1inne Conole\nEditor\nReferences\nConole, G.
