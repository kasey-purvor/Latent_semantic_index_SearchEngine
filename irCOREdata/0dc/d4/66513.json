We find positive\nresults in that various features relate to Galactic properties. For example, on the largest\nangular scales we find significant differences between the power in the fluctuations for\npositive and negative Galactic latitudes and between the four Galactic Quadrants.\nThere are also differences between the power spectrum at latitudes within 10\u25e6 of the\nPlane and at higher latitudes. The mean temperature shows similar variations. An\nexplanation in terms of Galactic effects seems inescapable.\nIn an effort to find the origin of these Galactic-style effects we have examined\nthe evidence from Galactic gamma rays, specifically from the EGRET instrument\n(Hunter et al. 1997). We are mindful that the CMB maps examined (Tegmark et al.\n2003) have already been \u2018cleaned\u2019 (for cosmic ray and other effects) in a rather complex\nway but, in our view, the cleaning has left potentially serious \u2019contaminations\u2019. A\ncorrelation is found between gamma ray intensities and the CMB and other cosmic\nray indicators. For example, regions of the Galaxy having (line of sight) steep cosmic\nray energy spectra have low mean CMB temperatures and the important Loop I edge\nregion, where the cosmic ray intensity is high, has a high mean temperature.\nMost of the large scale Galactic asymmetries (eg North, South difference and\nQuadrant variations) have analogues in cosmic ray asymmetries and also in some\nother Galactic properties, such as the column density of gas. Thus, it is possible\nto hypothesize on direct cosmic ray-induced contributions, although it may be that\ncosmic rays are simply the indicators of Galactic \u2018conditions\u2019 which are influencing\nthe residual CMB fluctuations.\nIrrespective of the actual cause of the correlations we have endeavoured to extrap-\nolate to the situation where the residual foreground is minimised. The effect on the\nusually derived cosmological properties is briefly examined. The least that can be said\nis that the \u2019error\u2019 in some of these properties has been underestimated.\nKey words: cosmic microwave background \u2013 cosmic rays.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nIt is well known that although the Galactic foreground\nto the CMB measurements should be small, it is not\nzero. Some 15 years ago we (Banday & Wolfendale 1990;\nBanday & Wolfendale. 1991) drew attention to the fact that,\ndespite the contribution to the \u2018CMB\u2019 spectrum from elec-\ntron bremsstrahlung falling rapidly with frequency, the con-\n\u22c6 E-mail: wibig@zpk.u.lodz.pl;\ntribution from dust rises rapidly and there is a frequency\nregion \u2013 from 30 - 100 GHz - where their sum has nearly\nthe same 2.7K spectrum. The derived value of \u2206T\/T was\nabout 2.5\u00d710\u22126 , ie \u2206T is about 7\u00b5K. The angular scale was\n8\u25e6 relating to the Tenerife experiment (Watson et al 1988)\n(beam width 8.8\u25e6 FWHM and the beam throw 8.2\u25e6), and\nthe value related to a \u2018quiet\u2019 region of the Galaxy, \u2019quiet\u2019 in\nthe sense of having low radio and dust signals. The corre-\nsponding value for b = 90\u25e6 was close to this value. It was\nclaimed, further, that the minimum foreground (synchrotron\n2 T. Wibig and A. W. Wolfendale\nplus dust) would be at a frequency of 70 GHz for the \u2019DC\nsignal\u2019, ie the absolute intensity as distinct from the fluctu-\nations in the foreground temperature.An important param-\neter is the degree of flatness of the foreground temperature\nvs frequency. Taking a straight line between 20 and 90 GHz\nas datum, the maximum downward deviation was a factor\n3.0. Actual measurements (De Oliveira-Costa, et al. 2004)\nnow enable the DC level to be determined. WMAP data\nat the five frequencies (22.8 to 93.5 GHz) do indeed show a\nminimum signal at about 60 GHz and the form of the depen-\ndence of temperature on frequency is even flatter, the factor\nbeing only 2.0. The absolute temperature level is somewhat\nhigher, even, than \u2019our\u2019 early prediction.\nTaking our predicted temperature fluctuations, as dis-\ntinct from the DC level, at \u2206T \u223c 7\u00b5K for the minimum, the\naverage over much of the Galaxy, but away from the Galac-\ntic Plane, would be of order 20\u00b5K. Inspection of the power\nspectrum for the WMAP (Bennett et al. 2003b) shows that\nfor 8\u25e6 (\u2113 \u223c 36) the average power is \u223c 1000 \u00b5K2. \u2019Our\u2019 400\n\u00b5K2 is therefore a significant fraction. There is thus a prima\nfacie case for a serious contribution.\nCorrection of the WMAP for the Galactic foreground\nhas been made by the WMAP group (Bennett et al. 2003c)\nwho have carried out a procedure to generate, not a pub-\nlished map but a power spectrum. Many workers have used\nthis power spectrum to derive important cosmological pa-\nrameters. Here we will use a cleaned map (Tegmark et al.\n2003) the cleaning of which was carried out by a more so-\nphisticated technique, specifically the individual frequency\nsets of data were weighted not just according to frequency\n(as in Bennett et al. (2003c)) but also by harmonic (\u2113) in\nthe power spectrum analysis.\nAn important point to be mentioned at this stage is the\nfact that the well-known cosmic ray (electron synchrotron)\ncontribution to the foreground at low frequencies is cor-\nrelated with that of dust at the highest frequencies. This\nis a consequence of the well-known strong correlation be-\ntween the synchrotron and far infra-red radiation emission\nof galaxies, commented on by many workers over the years,\nincluding ourselves eg (Chi & Wolfendale. 1990). Although\nthere can be no certainty about the mechanism, a possibil-\nity relates to CR-heating of the very cold dust clouds in the\nGalactic Halo. In this respect we are mindful of the com-\nment (Burton & Deul 1987) that \u201d... between a few K and\nabout 30 K, the (neutral) gas is almost entirely in the form\nof molecular hydrogen, residing in dense clumps...\u201d. Inter-\nestingly, confining attention to cold clumps, their contribu-\ntion could well fall off with Galactic latitude more slowly\nthan cosec |b|, because many of the low |b| clouds would\nbe warmed by Galactic Plane radiation and not recorded in\nthe CMB map. In fact, the b-dependence may not be at all\nsimple.\nBefore continuing it is instructive to examine the var-\nious energy densities. The CMB radiation has an energy\ndensity of 0.24 eVcm\u22123 and is universal; that in cosmic rays\nis \u223c 0.5 eV cm\u22123, and, as is well known, this is the same as\nthat in interstellar magnetic fields, gas motion and starlight\n\u2013 all in the local region of the Galaxy. The fluctuations in\nthe CMB correspond to about (1-10)\u00d710\u22126 eV cm\u22123 \u2013 on\nvarious angular scales \u2013 and a fraction of the CR energy\ndensity (or of one of the other components of similar energy\ndensity) of order 10\u22126 going into pseudo-CMB signals would\nnot appear impossible. In view of the importance of the CR\n\u2018background\u2019 in other searches, eg for cosmic neutrinos, dark\nmatter particles, magnetic monopoles, it would perhaps be\nsurprising if CR effects were absent.\nHow much of the CR foreground has in fact been taken\nout by the \u2018cleaning\u2019 is open to question but we presume\nthat most of the contribution has been removed and that\nthe residual will vary slowly with Galactic latitude. Inso-\nfar as the synchrotron radiation has a pronounced asymme-\ntry about the Galactic Plane, with a North\/South (N\/S)\nratio less than unity (Bennett et al. 2003c; Burton & Deul\n1987) \u2013 and all the WMAP frequencies show this effect\nbefore correction (Bennett et al. 2003c) we will search for\nsuch an asymmetry in the cleaned map; such an asymme-\ntry is also present in other Galactic phenomena, as will be\ndemonstrated later. Similarly, in view of all Galactic phe-\nnomena being dependent on the Galactic Quadrant con-\ncerned, Quadrant variations will also be searched for.\nOur work is not the first to claim asymmetries in the\ncleaned WMAP. Although theWMAP group (Bennett et al.\n2003b,c) claimed that there is no evidence for non-Gaussian\nprimordial fluctuations in the WMAP, and they quote many\nother workers who have come to the same conclusion, other\nrecent studies (Hansen et al. 2004), have shown that \u2019strong\nnon-Gaussian features emerge when considering the North-\nern and Southern Galactic hemispheres separately\u2019. Others\nstill (Ericksen, et al. 2004a; Eriksen et al. 2004b) had, pre-\nviously, found asymmetries in the distribution of the CMB\nfluctuations in the two hemispheres. Thus, the present work\nis another contribution to the debate on asymmetries in gen-\neral, but with an independent approach.\nThe cosmic ray aspect is, so far as we know, truly orig-\ninal.\nSome remarks are necessary first about the adopted\nmap used throughout the analysis. This is the \u2019high resolu-\ntion foreground- cleaned CMB map from WMAP\u2019 given by\nTegmark et al. (2003). Although theWMAP group itself has\nanalysed the basic data from the WMAP instrument in great\ndetail, and derived best-fit results for the various cosmologi-\ncal parameters (Bennett et al. 2003a,b), it has not given the\nnecessary cleaned-map data. Furthermore, its treatment of\nthe five WMAP frequency maps to allow for foreground ap-\npears to us to be rudimentary in that \u2113-independent statisti-\ncal weights were applied before the data were combined. In\nthe map adopted by us, (Tegmark et al. 2003), \u2113-dependent\nweights were used and, although we contend that significant\nforeground remains, the data should be better.\nWe estimate that the resolution of the adopted data is\nabout 12\u2019 and that, although the minimum in the power\nspectrum at \u2113 \u223c 350 is enhanced somewhat, the effect on\nthe \u2019one-degree-peak\u2019 should be small. The authors state\nthat the Galactic residuals seen along the Galactic Plane\n\u2019are present in only a tiny fraction of the total sky area and\ntherefore contribute little to the total power spectrum\u2019.\n2 LARGE SCALE ASYMMETRIES\n2.1 The Parameters Under Study\nThe CMB sky is characterized by the temperatures of indi-\nvidual pixels and these can be studied in a variety of ways,\nas follows:\nForeground contributions to the Cosmic Microwave Background 3\ni) The search for discrete excesses and deficits. For sizes\nof the order of a few pixels most will relate to extragalactic\nsystems such as active galactic nuclei. We have identified\nseveral AGN and the VIRGO, PEGASUS 1 and PISCES\nclusters.In general, we find six times as many excesses as\nwe find from searches in \u2019artificial universes\u2019, taken from\nthe conventional CMB power spectrum. Turning to deficits\n(eg Sunyaev-Zeldovich reductions in galaxy clusters) we find\ntwice as many in the genuine map as in artificial universes.\nThe significance of the above is two fold; our technique of\nanalysis receives a measure of support; the integrated mag-\nnitude of their contributions is small - and only affects the\nresults at the highest of \u2113 values.\nii) An analysis of the power spectrum formed from the ba-\nsic data. The standard technique is usually adopted to give\nW (\u2113) = \u2113(\u2113+1)C\u2113\/2\u03c0, where \u2113 is the multipole and C\u2113 is the\nangular power spectrum average derived by averaging the\nsum of the squares of the terms in the spherical harmonic.\nThe expression gives the power per logarithmic intervals of\n\u2113 and inspection of the form of W (\u2113), eg (Bennett et al.\n2003b,c; Tegmark et al. 2003), shows that much of the power\nis at large \u2113, specifically in the region of the \u2019one-degree\npeak\u2019. We expect the Galactic foreground effects to be on\nthe scales of rather small \u2113 (perhaps \u2113 = 10) as distinct\nfrom the \u2113 = 200 related to the \u2019one-degree peak\u2019 but all\nscales are, in principle, possible. Here, we usually study the\n\u2113-dependence of parameters but, where undue complexity\nwould arise, we give results for just \u2113 = 10 and \u2113 = 100.\niii) Averaging the sky over large regions gives the mean\nCMB temperature,\u3008\u2206T \u3009CMB. By definition, over the whole\nsky this will be zero, but for restricted regions the value\nwill be finite, and its study can be useful. Inspection of the\n\u2206TCMB distribution for individual pixels shows a median ex-\ncess of 80 \u00b5K (of those which are possible) with 10% having\n\u2206T > 200 \u00b5K. The 80 \u00b5K level in the standard WMAP\nmaps is the \u2019green level\u2019, with many regions having angular\nsize of order several tens of degrees.\nFrom what has been stated it is apparent that it will be\nvaluable to look at features in the map from both the power\n\u2013 and the mean temperature \u2013 points of view.\n2.2 North-South Asymmetry\nFor all Galactic radiations there is a major symmetry, with\nrespect to latitude, together with a N-S asymmetry (details\nof which are given later). The former usually predominates\nbut the effect of the map cleaning would be expected to\nremove most of this; the result is that the symmetry and\nasymmetry may be of not too dissimilar magnitude. A near\ncosec |b| dependence (but bearing in mind previous remarks)\nmight be expected; in fact, any disk-like emission (or ab-\nsorption) would be expected to give such a |b|-dependence,\nassuming near constant emissivity per unit volume over\nthe Galactic disc. It should be remarked that the original\nWMAP results for the individual frequencies (Bennett et al.\n2003c), show a pronounced cosec |b| dependence over the\nrange for which data are given: cosec|b| = 1 to 4, the slope\nof which is systematically higher in the South than the North\n(there are also subtleties in the results to which we will refer\nlater). Thus, there are both symmetries and asymmetries.\nA basic question is \u201dto what extent has the cosec |b| de-\npendence, and with it the largest scale Galactic foreground,\nbeen taken out in the \u2019cleaning-process\u2019?\u201d\nThe fact that the cosec |b| dependence, and N-S asym-\nmetry in the basic WMAP data, are independent of fre-\nquency is an important result in that it suggests the fact\nmentioned in Sect. 1 that there may be a spatial connection\nbetween the \u2019low\u2019 frequency emission (22 GHz), which is re-\nlated to cosmic ray electrons, and the \u2019high\u2019 frequency emis-\nsion (93 GHz), which is affected by Galactic dust. This was\nthe logic behind adding the foreground \u2206T values from these\ntwo mechanisms in our earlier work. (Banday & Wolfendale\n1990; Banday & Wolfendale. 1991). We start by comparing\nthe power spectra for the N & S for the same latitude bands.\nWe are mindful of the \u2019cosmic variance\u2019 which pervades the\ninterpretation of all the WMAP data, but particularly at\nlow values of \u2113. Figure 1 shows the situation. The smooth\ncurves through the points for the North have been given in\nthe graph for the South, for illustration purposed only. Inter-\npretation needs to allow for the non-independence of nearby\n\u2113-values for a particular set of data; we estimate that this\ndependence exists over a range in \u2113 of \u2206\u2113 a factor 2.\nFurthermore, there is the diminishing effect on the\nSouth\/North ratio at small |b| and low \u2113; for example, at\n\u2113 = 10 (\u223c 18\u25e6) the ratio should fall at |b| < 10\u25e6 where the\ninnermost b-values are separated by less than 20\u25e6. It does;\nfrom 3.1 at |b| = 10\u25e6 \u2212 20\u25e6 to 1.3 for |b| < 2\u25e6.\nThe most important plot is that of the South\/North ra-\ntio vs \u2113. Figure 1c shows the result summed over all latitudes;\nalso shown is the mean spread for cosmic variance alone. It\nis interesting to note that the S-excess persists over virtually\nthe whole range of \u2113. Formally, it is most significant at the\nlargest \u2113-values, a surprising result. The statistical signifi-\ncance of the excess is not easy to estimate but, allowing for\nthe dependence of nearby values (within \u2206\u2113 \u223c a factor of\n2), it is at the 1% level.\nTurning to the b-dependence of the S-N ratio, the sig-\nnificance is far less than might be expected from the large\nexcesses seen in Figure 1d, because of the small solid an-\ngles for the individual b-ranges. Furthermore, the excesses\nare greatest at low \u2113 where lack of independence of adja-\ncent bins, for small b, are most serious, as remarked already.\nHowever, the consequent errors are not large; inspection of\nFigures 1c and 1d shows that the weighted (by solid angle)\nratios from Figure 1a are 3.14 (\u2113=5) and 2.1(\u2113=10), to be\ncompared with 2.7 and 1.7 respectively. The \u2019error\u2019 is thus\nonly about 20%.\nRestricting attention to \u2113 < 10 and |b| > 10\u25e6, the de-\npendence is less serious and something useful can be said\nAllowing for the reduced solid angles, the excesses are in the\nregion of the \u2019upper limit\u2019 to the variance for 10\u25e6 < |b| < 60\u25e6,\na region having 70% of the solid angle. The corresponding\nsignificance of the southern excess, after allowing for the fact\nthat the measured ratio rises at a faster rate than the upper\nlimit expected by chance, gives a formal chance probability\nof \u223c3%, this value relating to the low \u2113-values (much of the\nweight for the previous 1% came from higher \u2113-values).\nThe results on the N\/S ratio suggest that there is a fi-\nnite Galactic foreground, affecting both low \u2113 (all b) - and,\nindeed, perhaps all \u2113. In the next section we continue to\nstudy the evidence for foreground effects by examining the\ndata Quadrant by Quadrant (Quadrant 1 covers the range\n\u2113 = 0\u25e6 to 90\u25e6; Quadrant 2, the range 90\u25e6 \u2212 180\u25e6, and so on.\n4 T. Wibig and A. W. Wolfendale\nQuadrants 1 and 4 comprise the Inner Galaxy and Quad-\nrants 2 and 3 the Outer Galaxy).\n2.3 Quadrant-dependent effects\nThere are well-known differences in all Galactic properties,\nQuadrant to Quadrant. Near the Galactic Plane, at least,\nthe Inner Galaxy has higher intensities of every radiation\nthan the Outer Galaxy. We start with the power spectrum.\nFigure 2a shows the mean power vs \u2113 for each Quad-\nrant for latitudes below 10\u25e6 and Figure 2b shows results for\nlatitudes above 10\u25e6. There is little doubt that the two |b|\nregions differ. Figures 2c and 2d show ratios with respect to\nQuadrant 1.\nIt is evident that a case can be made for there being big\nvariations in power, Quadrant to Quadrant, particularly at\nsmall \u2113 and for |b| < 10\u25e6 these persist to high \u2113-values.\nConsidering, first, |b| < 10\u25e6, and \u2113 = 10, the variance ex-\npected has an upper limit \u223c 4.6, so that Q3\/Q1 and Q4\/Q1\nare on this limit. Q2\/Q1 is below it. The overall chance prob-\nability for \u2113 < 10 is \u223c10%. At higher \u2113, where the variance\nis smaller, there is an interesting and significant difference\nbetween the Inner Galaxy (Q1 & Q4) and the Outer (Q2\nand Q3), the power in the Inner is decidedly higher. Inner\nversus Outer is different - for \u2113 > 50 - at about the 1% level.\nTurning to |b| > 10\u25e6, the solid angle is bigger (83%\nof the whole) but the excess is smaller. Interestingly, the\nsignificance of \u2019the effect\u2019 is similar, at least for Q1, Q2 and\nQ3 with respect to Q1, in the region of \u2113 \u223c 5. At higher \u2113,\nthe significance drops, although above \u2113 \u223c 100, the ratios\nfor Q3 and Q4 are formally significantly above unity.\nIn terms of the absolute magnitudes, Figures 2e and 2f\nshow comparisons between the power as a function of \u2113 for\nthe two Inner and Outer Galaxy Quadrants and that for the\nstandard CMB model (Bennett et al. 2003b), divided by 4\n(ie each for one quarter of the solid angle).\nSome remarks are necessary about these two Figures.\nFirstly, considering the small \u2019wiggles\u2019, these are not signif-\nicant. Secondly, the difference between Inner Galaxy (ex-\nemplified by Q1) and Outer Galaxy (Q3) is seen. Thirdly,\nthe sum of the powers for each Quadrant is nearer conven-\ntional expectation for Q1 than Q3, a result due to the larger\ncontribution from |b| < 10\u25e6.\nFurther analysis comes from an examination of the over-\nall mean CMB temperature (as distinct from the power,\n\u2206T 2) as a function of latitude. Figure 3 shows the results.\nInspection of the figure shows a number of features\ni) There are marked differences Quadrant to Quadrant in\nmean temperature. Quantification of a lower limit to the\nsignificance of the variations can be made by assuming that\nthe variations within one Quadrant from one latitude band\nto another are representative of the errors and deriving the\nmean displacement from zero. Considering |b| > 10\u25e6, where\nsuccessive latitude bands are sufficiently independent, we\nfind, taking the 8 \u2019regions\u2019 (4 Quadrants, N and S); 4 cases\nbetween 0 and 1 standard deviation, 3 between 1 and 2 and\none as high as 5 standard deviations. There is thus evidence\nfor significant excursions from zero.\nIn the Galactic Plane itself (|b| < 2\u25e6) there is a clear ex-\ncess temperature. The average is 27 \u00b5K and, if it is valid to\ndetermine the error from the dispersion of the four sets of\ndata this discrepancy from zero is at the 4 standard devia-\ntion level. Using the mean error for the other 8 sets of data\nat |b| > 10\u25e6 (and five values for each set) the significance\nrises to nearly 6 standard deviations. The excess is far big-\nger than one would have expected from the remarks about\ncleaning in Tegmark et al. (2003).\nEqually important are the symmetries, as follows:\nii) Figures 3a and 3b show clear symmetries in the b de-\npendence for the two Quadrants in the Inner Galaxy (Q1\nand Q4) and those in the Outer Galaxy (Q2 and Q3). Turn-\ning to data for the N and S separately Figures 3(c) and (d),\nin Quadrants 1 and 2 there is fair symmetry between N and\nS. In Quadrants 3 and 4 there is some symmetry (but less\nthan for Quadrants 1 and 2) for |b| > 10\u25e6 (it is relevant to\npoint out that the giant \u2019hole\u2019 in the CMB, at \u2113 \u223c 300\u25e6 to\n360\u25e6, b \u223c 0\u25e6 to \u221230\u25e6, is responsible for the very low mean\ntemperature in Quadrant 4 for b: \u22122\u25e6 to \u221220\u25e6. The sym-\nmetry can be quantified by comparing the separation of the\ntwo values, at each |b|, with \u221a2 times the modules of the\ndistribution of the individual values about zero. The result\nfor the ratio of the median values, (equivalent to a number\nof standard deviations) is, for Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4; 2.1, 2.1,\n1.4 and 1.1. The symmetry is seen to be reasonably signifi-\ncant for Q1 and Q2. Taken overall, N-S symmetry is present\nat the 2.4 sigma level.\niii) There is no systematic excess temperature in the South\nas there is in the power spectrum at low \u2113 (Figure 2), at\nleast averaged over all b (but see later).\niv) In the Outer Galaxy (Quadrant 2 and 3) there is some\nevidence for a minimum in the range |b| = 30\u25e6 \u2212 40\u25e6, ie a\nsymmetrical feature.\nv) In the Inner Galaxy (Quadrants 1 and 4) there is a dip\nin the range 2\u25e6 \u2212 20\u25e6 in all four cases, again a symmetrical\nfeature.\nvi) In every case the mean temperature for |b| < 2\u25e6 is\nhigher than that for |b| = 2\u25e6 \u2212 6\u25e6 and higher than that\naveraged over the |b| = 2\u25e6 \u2212 20\u25e6 range.\nvii) There is a fall in \u3008\u2206T \u3009CMB with increasing |b| over the\nrange |b| = 6\u25e6 \u2212 45\u25e6, after which there is an increase.\nviii) Figures 3(e) and 3(f) show good symmetry between the\ntwo Inner Quadrants (1 and 4), and between the two Outer\nQuadrants (2 and 3).\nThe conclusions to be drawn at this stage from the results\non \u3008\u2206T \u3009 are:\ni) There is a clear excess at |b| < 2\u25e6 averaged over all\nQuadrants and thus there is certainly some foreground left\nin this range.\nii) Whilst there are clear Galactic features these are not of\nsimple cosec b form over the whole range of |b|; nevertheless\nthere is a reduction of temperature from |b| = 6\u25e6 to 45\u25e6, the\nregion with most of the solid angle of the sky.\niii) There are interesting symmetries about the Galactic\nPlane.\nComparison with the other results on \u2019Gaussianity\u2019, etc will\nbe made later.\nThe results of the mean temperature are not necessarily\ninconsistent with those for the power spectrum (Figure 2)\nbecause the mean temperature relates to a form of integral\nover all \u2113-values, whereas the power spectrum refers to the\nForeground contributions to the Cosmic Microwave Background 5\nsquare of the temperature and is, of course, \u2113-dependent.\nThis aspect can best be studied by examining plots similar\nto Figure 3 for the power (per unit solid angle) for different\n\u2113-values. We remember that the power spectrum represents\nthe power per unit logarithmic interval in \u2113.\nFigure 4 shows the results for two values of \u2113, \u2113 = 10\nand \u2113 = 100. The main feature here of relevance to symmetry\nare:\ni) Again, there is an excess nearest the Galactic Plane - in\nthis case for |b| < 10\u25e6. The significance has been examined as\nfor mean temperature, deriving the mean value for the other\nlatitudes, and its error, and finding the difference between\nthe value for |b| < 10\u25e6 and this mean. There are 8 sets of data\nand the result is that for \u2113 = 10 the average difference is 2.2\nstandard deviations - ie over 5 standard deviations overall.\nFor \u2113=100, the significance is even bigger, amounting to 10\nstandard deviations. For \u2113 = 100, where the interdependence\nof different |b|-bands is least, there is a strong difference\nbetween Inner and Outer Galaxy. In the range |b| < 10\u25e6, the\nexcess in the Inner Galaxy is 2.6 times that in the Outer.\nThe significance is 3.2 standard deviations. For |b| > 10\u25e6 the\nexcess changes to a deficit. The ratio is 0.72 \u00b1 0.05, ie 5.6\nstandard deviations from unity. There is clearly no evidence\nfor a constancy of power.\nii) In every one of the 16 cases (for both \u2113-values) the power\nin the |b| = 10\u25e6 \u2212 20\u25e6 is lower than would be expected on\nthe basis of the adjacent points; thus a Galactic symmetry.\niii) For \u2113=10, in three out of four Quadrants there is a slow\nfall of power with increasing latitude beyond |b| = 20\u25e6. A\nplot of\n\u221a\n\u3008\u2206T 2\u3009 vs cosec |b| in this range yields a slope of\n0.3+0.04\/\u22120.15 (\u00b5K2sr\u22121)1\/2 for |b| > 20\u25e6. The mean S\/N\nratio in this region can be derived from Figure 1d. It is 1.3\n(the square root of the derived value, which related to \u2206T 2),\nto be compared with\n\u221a\n1.7 = 1.3, for all longitudes at \u2113 = 1,\n(Figure 1c). An important result is that the mean slope for\nthe South is greater than that for the North, although this\nresult comes mainly from Quadrant 4. None of the features\ndescribed above would be expected for \u2019cosmic variance\u2019.\niv) At \u2113 = 100, the effects are too small, in comparison\nwith the errors, for a pattern to be discerned with respect\nto |b| dependence and N-S ratio.\nThe conclusions here are that, again, there is residual\nforeground near the Galactic Plane, the range |b| = 10\u25e6\u221220\u25e6\nappears to have been overcorrected and that, at low \u2113, there\nis an all-latitude foreground. Furthermore, there is evidence\nfor a cosec |b| dependence of the root mean square power (at\nthe 2\u03c3 level).\nTurning to the N-S asymmetry, we note that the S\/N\nratio for power, is, for \u2113=10, and increasing |b|: 2.11, 2.49,\n1.79, 1.85, 2.25 and 0.95. leaving out the (anomalous) Quad-\nrant 4, the S\/N ratios are: 2.39, 2.69, 1.53, 2.83, 1.50 and\n0.72.\nThe S\/N ratio therefore dips towards unity at |b| \u223c\n\u221260\u25e6 in the second case. Inspection of the 408 MHz re-\nsults (Bennett et al. 2003c), shows that there is a reduc-\ntion in ratio starting at |b| \u223c 40\u25e6 reaching a minimum at\n|b| \u223c 60\u25e6. The individual frequency bands for WMAP (un-\ncleaned) show a ratio of \u223c1.37(+0.13-0.04) at |b|=30\u25e6 (and\nlittle variation at lower b), 1.21 (+0.04 \u2212 0.02) at |b|= 40\u25e6\nand 1.06 (+0.04-0.02)at |b|=60\u25e6, the limits encompassing\nthe whole range of frequencies. It is interesting to note that\nthere is no systematic change to the S\/N ratio with fre-\nquency; but both in the 408 MHz and the individual WMAP\nfrequencies there is a reduction in ratio at mid-latitudes; 40\u25e6\nat 408 MHz and \u223c40\u25e6 in the individual WMAP frequency\n\u2206T -values, to be compared with 45\u25e6 - 60\u25e6 in the \u2113= 10\nWMAP power. Once again, then, there is evidence of insuf-\nficient cleaning.\nAn important aspect is a comparison of the two Quad-\nrants in the outer Galaxy, Q2 and Q3 in both \u3008T \u3009 and power;\nwe would expect greater activity in Q2 in comparison with\nQ3 because of the greater number of SNR, HII regions, etc\nthere.\nInspection of Figure 3 shows that the temperature in Q2\nis higher than that in Q3 for every latitude bin, except for\nthe (anomalous) region |b| :\u223c 10\u25e6\u00f720\u25e6 and the previous bin.\nThe excess (Q2-Q3) in \u2206T is successively, for |b| = 0\u25e6 \u2212 2\u25e6,\n2\u25e6\u22126\u25e6, ,> 60\u25e6: +17, +12, -7, -5, 7, 3, 3 and 19 \u00b5K. An excess\nis thus well founded. Insofar as much of \u2206T comes from high\n\u2113-values (and thus small angular sizes), there should be little\ncross-talk between the two Quadrants.\nSurprisingly, perhaps, the same feature (Q2>Q3) does\nnot pertain for the power per steradian (Figure 4). For \u2113 =\n10, only for the highest latitudes (|b| > 60\u25e6) is Q2>Q3 \u2013\nand here we would expect the nearest approach to equality.\nFor |b| > 10\u25e6 the ratio for Q2\/Q3 is 0.56, for |b| = 10\u25e6\u2212 20\u25e6\nit is 0.43 and the average for |b| > 20\u25e6 is 0.69. At \u2113 =\n100, a similar situation pertains: for |b| > 10\u25e6, Q2\/Q3 =\n0.93, for |b| > 10\u25e6 \u2212 20\u25e6, Q2\/Q3 = 0.97 and for |b| > 20\u25e6\nQ2\/Q3 = 0.94. Again, in all latitude bins, Q2\/Q3>1 with\nthe exception of |b| > 60\u25e6 where Q2\/Q3 = 1.\nThus, there is a clear difference in the power per stera-\ndian for Q2 and Q3 and one that is systematic over all lati-\ntudes (see Figure 2). At first sight it is of the opposite sense\nto that expected but the answer may lie in the fact that the\nradial gradient of the CR intensity is (surprisingly) smaller\nfor Q3 in comparison with that for Q2 (Erlykin et al. 1996).\nTurning to the S\/N ratios for Q2 and Q3, overall (over\nall b) these are: Q2, 1.63 (1.04); Q3, 1.79 (1.09). The first\nvalue related to \u2113 = 10 and the second to \u2113 = 100.\nThe corresponding values for b > 20\u25e6 are: 1.69 (0.96)\nand 1.72 (1.02). The ratio is thus rather stable with respect\nto the limit on |b|. A different situation pertains for \u3008T \u3009,\nwhere the differences (S-N) are, for Q2, +33 \u00b5K (+16) and\nfor Q3 \u22126 \u00b5K (+25 \u00b5K) the first value is for |b| > 2\u25e6 and\nthat in brackets is for |b| > 20\u25e6. The fact that a S-excess is\npresent for |b| > 20\u25e6 in both power and \u3008T \u3009 is reassuring, as\nis the similar magnitude for both Quadrants.\n2.4 Comparison with the original WMAP and\n408 MHz data\nA further aspect of the 408 MHz data is the presence of \u2019fine\nstructure\u2019 in the cosec |b|-plots\u2019 and also in the separate plots\nof \u2206T vs cosec |b|. In every one of the six plots (Watson et al\n1988) there are consistent features, in order of diminishing\nmagnitude:\n- Minima near cosec |b| = 2.0 (ie |b| = 30\u25e6)\n- Minima at cosec |b| = 3.15 (|b| = 18.5\u25e6)\n- Minima at cosec |b| = 1.15 (|b| = 60.4\u25e6), all for the\nNorth.\nFor the South there are:\n6 T. Wibig and A. W. Wolfendale\n- Minima at cosec |b| = 1.15 (|b| = 60.4\u25e6)\nAnd, for the five WMAP frequencies alone, there are:\n- minima at cosec |b| = 2.15.\nIn the North alone at the smallest angle (cosec |b| = 4,\nie |b| = 14.5\u25e6) there is an excess over the \u2019best straight\nline\u2019 growing systematically with frequency, reaching 17%\nat 93 GHz. There is no equivalent in the South.\nSuch fine structure, even when the data are integrated\nover all longitudes, lead us to believe that significant varia-\ntions, correlated in frequency, undoubtedly exist for smaller\nlongitude bins - as we claim. It is very doubtful if such\neffects would be subtracted out in the WMAP cleaning\nprocedure (Bennett et al. 2003c; Komatsu et al. 2003) - in\nwhich the weights vary considerably from one frequency\nto another. (They are, in order of increasing frequency,\n23\u2212 93 GHz, +0.109, \u22120.684, \u22120.096, +1.921 and \u22120.250).\nFurthermore, the weights are the same for N and S, whereas\nthe dependence of slope of \u2206T vs cosec |b| is different for\nN and S. Specifically, the slopes are, for 23 \u2212 93 GHz:\n(\u03b4\u2206T\/\u03b4(cosec|b|))S\/N = 1.50, 1.47, 1.67, 1.61 and 1.50. That\nfor 408 MHz is lower: 1.10 although, because the dependence\nof T on cosec |b| is less linear, there is an appreciable error.\n2.5 The Situation at High Latitudes\nIt is instructive to examine the situation beyond |b| = 45\u25e6\nin some detail because this region had been expected to be\nfar enough from the Galactic Plane to be completely free of\nforeground (Bennett et al. 2003b).\nOther work (Hansen et al. 2004) , mentioned already,\nhas suggested that the axis of symmetry of a large scale\nmodulation of the CMB signal is in fact, not along the Galac-\ntic N-S axis but nearer the axis through the Ecliptic Poles.\nThese results will be discussed later in (Wibig & Wolfendale\n2005); here, we examine this aspect from a different stand-\npoint. Ideally, with a large foreground contribution, we\nmight expect the \u2019N-S axis\u2019 to be defined by the lowest\nsignals in the N and S hemispheres. However, even in the\ncase of conventional Galactic radiation signatures (eg 21 cm\nline of the HI column density, synchrotron radiation, etc)\nthe minima are away from the Galactic Poles. Furthermore,\nas we have noted, some of our CMB parameters increase\nwith latitude above |b| = 45\u25e6. Thus, we determine the di-\nrections of both minima and maxima for each hemisphere.\nThe parameters studied comprise those from the CMB anal-\nysis already given, viz \u2206TCMB, W(\u2113=10) and the correlation\ncoefficient for CMB temperature with respect to the CR in-\ntensity (to be described). In addition, we include directions\nfor low (and high) spectral exponents for CR protons and\nelectrons (Fathoohi et al. 1985a,b), making 5 parameters in\nall. With the exception of p and e, the directions are im-\nprecise in that they are derived from the Quadrant - wide\nregions and |b| ranges 45\u25e6 \u2212 60\u25e6 and > 60\u25e6; poor statistics\npreclude a more precise study.\nThe results for the range of l and b, and the mean values,\nare as follows.\nMaxima\nN: l-range: 120\u25e6, mean l:90\u25e6 \u00b130\u25e6\nb-range: 20\u25e6, mean b: +50\u25e6 \u00b15\u25e6\nS: l-range: 90\u25e6, mean l:230\u25e6 \u00b1 25\u25e6\nb-range: 15\u25e6, mean b: -50\u25e6 \u00b15\u25e6\nMinima\nN: l-range: 180\u25e6, mean l: 200 \u25e6 \u00b1 50\u25e6\nb-range: 20\u25e6, mean b: +55\u25e6 \u00b1 5\u25e6\nS: l-range: 130\u25e6, mean l: 20\u25e6 \u00b1 35\u25e6\nb-range: 20\u25e6, mean b: \u221255\u25e6 \u00b15\u25e6\nInspection of the values shows that indeed the means\nof both maximum and minimum values do not centre on\nb = \u00b190\u25e6.\nThe analysis is such that a uniform (ie random) set of\ndirections would have a range of l - 360\u25e6 and a mean with\nan error in \u2113 of \u00b190\u25e6, ie bigger than observed.\nThe result is that the directions are consistent with con-\nformity as expected if foreground effects are significant at\nthe high latitudes - to the extent of about 2-3 sigma in the\nNorth and somewhat greater in the South. The small errors\nfor the b-values are perhaps illusory because of the small\noverall range of b considered: \u2019\u2206b = \u00b111.25\u25e6 (from the cen-\ntre of one bin to the centre of the other).\nInterestingly, the South, with its higher power, Fig-\nure 1, is more significant. Comparison with the other result\n(Hansen et al. 2004) is given later.\nAt this stage, we can claim some support for the hy-\npothesis that the foreground effects contribute to \u2019high\u2019 lat-\nitudes although to use the statistical weights just referred\nto is unwise since we run the risk of double counting, having\nalready used the e and p result and some aspects of \u2206T -\nand power - variations.\n2.6 Comparison with other studies of\nasymmetries in the cleaned maps\nMention has already been made of the \u2019Gaussianity\u2019 differ-\nences. Work on comparing the statistic for each Galactic\nhemisphere (Ericksen, et al. (2004a) , b)has shown signifi-\ncant differences from expectation for the North but not for\nthe South. The nearest we come to an effect of this sort is\nthe variations from bin to bin in latitude of the power per sr\nat low \u2113 (\u2113 \u223c 10); Figure 4. In two of the Quadrants, 3 and 4,\nthe variation is bigger in the North than in the South. The\nconclusion that there is \u2019an unexpected power asymmetry\nbetween the N and S hemispheres in the WMAP data\u2019 is\ncertainly supported by our work. The authors of the Gaus-\nsianity work referred to above have gone on to use both the\npower spectrum and N-point correlation functions to argue\nthat the axis of maximum asymmetry is close to the ecliptic\naxis. A somewhat similar result has come from an analysis\nof \u2019the local curvature of WMAP data\u2019 (Hansen et al. 2004)\nalthough here anomalies are found for both hemispheres,\nat least for smoothing and the maximum asymmetry is be-\ntween the ecliptic axis and the Galactic Pole. Interestingly,\nit is demonstrated that for 5\u25e6\u221210\u25e6 smoothing the Southern\nhemisphere yields results too close to the Gaussian expected\nvalues. Inspection of the map for \u2019lake counts\u2019 (\u2019lakes\u2019 are\nregions where the differential of temperature vs position is\nchanging from negative to positive) shows maximum fluc-\ntuations which correlate reasonably with the \u2019hot regions\u2019\nin Figure 3. In fact, inspection of the map presented in\nHansen et al. (2004) shows that the centroids of the N and S\nForeground contributions to the Cosmic Microwave Background 7\nhemisphere regions having unusually high fluctuation values\nare somewhat away from the celestial poles.\nSpecifically, they are at l, b:90\u25e6, +50\u25e6 and 270\u25e6, -45\u25e6.\nThese values are close to our estimates for the mean\npositions of the maxima\n- l, b: 90\u25e6 \u00b1 30\u25e6, +50\u25e6 \u00b1 5\u25e6 and\n- l, b: 230\u25e6 \u00b1 25\u25e6, \u221250\u25e6 \u00b1 5\u25e6.\nThe near agreement can be regarded as a confirmatory\ncheck on our analysis - and thus an agreement - to some\nextent - with our contentions.\n2.7 Power spectra for \u2019red\u2019 and \u2019blue\u2019 maps\nBefore moving to the possible \u2019cosmic-ray-connection\u2019 it is\nnecessary to refer to a feature that we have discovered which\nmay have significance. We define points on the WMAP\n(Tegmark et al. 2003) having positive values as \u2019red\u2019 and\nnegative values as \u2019blue\u2019. Power spectra have been derived\nfor the whole sky for red maps and blue maps with the result\nshown in Figure 5a. Figure 5b shows the ratio. Figures 5c\nand 5d show the results for |b| > 10\u25e6. It is evident that\nin both cases, |b| < 10\u25e6 and |b| > 10\u25e6, there is a system-\natic difference in the shape of the power spectrum between\nobservation and expectation.\nComparison with the \u2019limits\u2019 for the artificial universes\nshows two main features:\ni) a clear excess of red over blue at the highest \u2113-values;\nii) a less significant deficit for \u2113 < 10.\nThe former can immediately be attributed to the contribu-\ntion from discrete sources. The significance of the important\ndeficit at low \u2113 needs discussion.\nInsofar as the power levels at \u2113 values exceeding \u2206\u2113 \u223c 5\nare largely independent, there are two values (at \u2113 = 5 and\n10) in this vicinity which are in the region of the lower limit.\nIf this limit corresponds to the one standard deviation level\nthen the chance probability is \u2243 7%. The significance for\ncosmology of the difference at low \u2113 will be considered later.\nOf greater importance is the observation of the clear\nslow increase in ratio with increasing values of \u2113. This in-\ncrease is due to increased \u2019foreground\u2019 in terms of both\nGalactic and Extragalactic (\u2019discrete\u2019 sources) components.\nInspection of artificial Universe results shows that the\nchance probability is less than about 3%. Taking low \u2113-values\nas a datum, and assuming that the total foreground affects\nonly the red points, the result is that for the important one-\ndegree peak the extra contribution is about 10%. Thus, from\nthis argument, the power of the peak should be reduced by\nthis amount.\n3 COSMIC RAY \u2013 CMB CORRELATIONS\n3.1 General Remarks\nAs remarked earlier, the presence of a cosec |b| variation\nin the mean CMB temperature at each and every WMAP\ntemperature from 22.8 to 93.6 GHz, Bennett et al. (2003c)\nshows that there is a definite contribution to the uncleaned\nmaps from Galactic \u2013 \u2019thin disk\u2019\u2013 mechanisms. These are\ngenerally regarded as: electron synchrotron radiation, free-\nfree radiation and dust.Insofar as the first mentioned is due\nto cosmic ray electrons and the dust is heated, in part at\nleast, by CR protons, we expected \u2019cosmic rays\u2019 in general\nto be implicated in the foreground problem. It is true that\nsubtracting off a cosec |b| dependence, and arranging that\nthe mean CMB temperature is 2.74K, removes much of the\nCR-related signal but some inevitably remains. Presumably,\nthe residuals remain on a variety of angular scales and a vari-\nety of magnitudes. Insofar as our knowledge of the distribu-\ntion of cosmic ray intensity and gas density (of all densities,\nincluding that in dust clouds) \u2013 in 3-dimensions\u2013 is very lim-\nited, a determination of the likely CR-related contribution\nis very difficult. Some general points can be made, however,\nas follows:\ni) Lines of sight where the CR-intensity (of relevant en-\nergy) is low might be expected to have low foreground\n\u3008CMB\u3009 (denoted \u3008CMB\u3009f ).\nii) Lines of sight where the column density of gas is low\n(\u2019Galactic chimneys\u2019 and other regions) and thus low CR\ninteraction should have low \u3008CMB\u3009f .\niii) Lines of sight crossing regions where the CR in-\ntensity is high (SNR shells) (Erlykin & Wolfendale 2001;\nWolfendale & Zhang 1994; Osborne et al. 1995) would be\nexpected to have high \u3008CMB\u3009f .\nEach of these regions will be considered in turn, as will\nan all-sky correlation using the low energy gamma ray data\nfrom EGRET (Tegmark et al. 2003) and a more energetic\ncomponent for |b| < 10\u25e6.\n3.2 Correlations in Steep CR-Spectra Regions\nFrom the maps of electron and proton (Fathoohi et al.\n1985a,b) spectral indices we have chosen regions covering\nabout 10% of the sky area. The results for a smoothing of 15\u25e6\nFWHM were taken for both the proton and electron compo-\nnents in that we expect CR \u2019variations\u2019 to be on this order of\nscale, corresponding to typical SNR-induced large scale tur-\nbulence. We expect the contours for protons and electrons\nto be similar, but not quite the same (differences of energies\nfor the initiating particles, electrons and protons, will cause\ndifferences in diffusion coefficients). An estimate of the dif-\nference can be made, as follows. The mean electron energy\nis about 1 GeV for the electrons responsible for the detected\ngamma rays and about 10 GeV for the protons so that the\nproton and electron escaping from their accelerating SNR\nwill be separated by of order 100 pc (Erlykin & Wolfendale\n2001) after a time of 106y (ten times the lifetime of the\nSNR). At a typical distance of 1 kpc the angular separa-\ntion will be of order 6\u25e6. The somewhat disparate patterns\nof Figure 5 are thus understandable.\nIn order to choose the most reliable regions of steep\nspectra - and because we are not sure which of electrons\nand protons are responsible - we have identified regions of\ncommon steep spectra for both protons and electrons in Fig-\nure 6 (see also Erlykin & Wolfendale (2001)); these should\ncorrespond to the most likely regions of maximum effect for\nthe CMB. By \u2019maximum effect\u2019, here, we mean lowest CMB\ntemperature because steep spectra indicate low particle in-\ntensities at the higher energies where we expect the extra\npseudo-CMB contribution to arise.\n8 T. Wibig and A. W. Wolfendale\nTable 1 indicates the regions so identified and the cor-\nresponding values of \u3008CMB\u3009 It will be noted that all are\nnegative. The significance of the deficits will be examined\nshortly.\n3.3 Correlations for Galactic Chimneys\nReturning to the presence of chimneys of low column density\nof HI, in which we have claimed steep spectra (and where\nwe used limited latitude regions above), an analysis has been\nmade of the mean CMB temperature along four major di-\nrections \u2013 lines of constant longitude (of width \u00b16\u25e6) over\ntheir whole latitude range; these directions do not always\ncoincide with those of steep spectra.\nThe mean temperature has been determined for 10\u25e6 <\n|b| < 60\u25e6, this being the nominal region over which the chim-\nneys can be identified. The results are also given in Table 1.\nIt can be seen that our expected reduction in mean\nCMB temperature is observed in 6 or 7 out of the 8 regions.\nThese results are potentially important and they will\nbe examined in more detail. In Wolfendale & Zhang (1994),\nwhere evidence was given for correlations of steep spectra\nfor low energy gamma rays with the Galactic chimneys and\nlow HI regions, a comparison was made between b+ (+30\n\u25e6)\nand b\u2212 (\u221230\u25e6). It was found that the b+ results were better,\nthose for negative latitudes being inferior, particularly for\nl = 57\u25e6 and 130\u25e6. These results related to electrons. With\nhigher energy gamma rays, however, where protons are the\nprogenitors, at negative latitudes, l = 57\u25e6 was poor, but\n130\u25e6 was good. The conclusion is that the anomalous posi-\ntive result for b\u2212 at l = 57\n\u25e6 can, perhaps, be understood, not\nleast because inspection of Galaxy-wide HI column density\nmaps shows that the \u2019chimney\u2019 at negative b and l \u223c 57\u25e6 is\nbarely visible.\n3.4 Correlations for Other Low HI-Column\nDensity Regions\nAnother approach, resembling the previous one, is to look\nat regions where the HI column density is low, irrespective\nof the CR intensity and away from the HI-chimney. The\nreason is that it may be that it is the HI density itself that\nis important rather than the CR intensity as such. Again,\nthe results are shown in Table 1.\n3.5 Correlations in High CR Intensity Regions\nIf, as seems possible, it is CR interacting with gas that\ngives rise to a pseudo-CMB contribution, then there should\nbe an excess of \u2206T (CMB) in regions where the CR\nintensity is high. Probably the best evidence for high\nCR intensities comes from studies of gamma rays (typ-\nically above 100 MeV) from SNR shocks (Bhat et al.\n1985; Wolfendale & Zhang 1994). It has been known for\nsome years that the famous Loop I SNR has somewhat\nhigher gamma ray emission than expected (Bhat et al.\n1985; Wolfendale & Zhang 1994). Most came from the\nwell-developed ridge which is seen in radio, eg at 408\nMHz, rising along b \u223c30\u25e6 from the Galactic Plane. The\ngamma ray work just referred to also shows evidence for\nCR acceleration in the shell of another SNR, Loop III,\n(Landecker & Wielebinski 1970) albeit at a lower level. Yet\nanother SRN, Loop II, seems to be present, but rather weak\nand is disregarded.\nTable 1 shows the results for the leading edge of the\nLoop I SNR (The North Polar spur), which is best identified\nin radio. Also shown are values pertaining to the regions at\n|b| < 10\u25e6 where the two Loops cross the Galactic Plane (Fig-\nure 7 shows the relevant CMB temperatures). This region\nis chosen so as to maximize any potential signal (positive or\nnegative) in view of the higher gas density here.\nIt is reassuring to note that the mean values of \u2206T are\nalmost always positive.\nIt remains in this section to consider the statistical sig-\nnificance of the correlation results so far.\nFigure 7 shows a histogram for the \u2206T values all over\nthe sky. The abscissa is in standard deviations and relates\nto areas of the magnitude used in the analysis. The symbols\nabove the plot are for the individual areas referred to above.\nIt is evident that the divergences are, taken at their face\nvalue, very significant. Formally, the chance of getting such\na situation is \u223c 10\u22124 for the negative excursions and \u223c 10\u22123\nfor those in the positive direction.\nIt is, of course, possible to question the significance on\na number of levels: why choose the particular bin widths of\nlatitude, and the particular size of the low N (HI) regions?\nThe answer is that they were chosen before the results were\nknown. Nevertheless, it is best to conclude at this stage that\nthe correlations are \u2019very suggestive\u2019.\n3.6 Whole-sky correlations of gamma rays and\nCMB\nThe EGRET data (Hunter et al. 1997; Tegmark et al.\n2003)have been used to search for correlations over the whole\nGalaxy, although it is appreciated that the statistical accu-\nracy of the gamma ray data is not great. Because there is\na strong latitude dependence of the gamma ray intensity\nwe study the CR-CMB correlation in narrow (but increas-\ning with |b|) latitude bins. We concentrate on the highest\nenergy (1 GeV) for which data of reasonable accuracy are\navailable for the whole Galaxy.\nThe analysis has been made in two ways. Firstly, by tak-\ning the data in large, Quadrant size, bins in longitude and\nsuccessive latitude bins and by taking 10 degree radius re-\ngions round successive pixels in the sky. Both methods have\ntheir merits, and demerits. Starting the with former, Fig-\nure 8 shows a map of the correlations in a manner such that\nthe latitude \u2013 and Quadrant \u2013 dependence can be sought. It\nis evident that there are both. The Inner Galaxy has no over-\nall positive correlation, formally it is negative, but the Outer\nGalaxy has a positive correlation, particularly in Quadrant\n2. There is also a pronounced dependence on Galactic lat-\nitude. This behaviour is surely suggestive of a relationship\nbetween the gamma ray intensity and the average CMB tem-\nperature, although the interdependence of bins is a worry.\nIt might be thought that one could take wider intervals of\nlatitude, near the Galactic Places, but here the CR intensity\nis such a strong function of latitude that artifacts can easily\noccur.\nBefore continuing the (largely negative) correlations in\nthe inner Galaxy will be considered further. It is possi-\nble, in principle, that the CMB radiation is absorbed in\nForeground contributions to the Cosmic Microwave Background 9\na particular geometrical way by high temperature ionized\ngas in the Galactic Halo, but the density and temperature\nneeded are excessive. Another source of CR-intensity might\nbe the answer: Inverse Compton interactions of electrons on\nstarlight. Another possibility might be associated with the\nfact (Sect. 3.3) that there is the reverse gradient of the CMB\npower at latitudes above 10\u25e6.\nWe found Quadrant-dependent effects in Sect. 2.2 and\nit is necessary to study Figure 8 in some detail. Although the\nlatitude regions are of unequal width they can be considered\nwith equal weight because, due to the strong b-dependence\nof the gamma ray intensity, there are similar numbers of\ndetected gamma rays in each band. In terms of strength of\nthe correlation coefficient, the net coefficients are:\nQuadrant 1 = 4.8; Quadrant 2 +60.4; Quadrant 3\n+27.3; Quadrant 4 \u221216.1;\nIt is appreciated that adjacent latitude bins are not in-\ndependent but this dependence is not too large, in view of\nthe observed quite wide spread in coefficients from one bin\nto another. Thus, we conclude that there is some evidence\nfor a correlation in the Outer Galaxy.\nFor the range above |b| = 20\u25e6, the summed coefficients\nare:\nQuadrant 1 +4.7; Quadrant 2 \u22124.0; Quadrant 3 +4.3;\nQuadrant 4 \u22124.7.\nThe differences here are evidently of no significance.\nThe positive correlation,(as evinced by this technique \u2013\nbut see later), is confined to |b| < 20\u25e6 and is predominantly\nin the Outer Galaxy. To what extent this result militates\nagainst a CR-CMB correlation at |b| > 20\u25e6 is not clear, in\nview of the poor gamma ray statistics at these latitudes and\nthe fact, mentioned already, that rather than the average\nCMB temperature that is important it is the temperature\nof the \u2019background\u2019 over large angular scales (ie omitting the\nhot \u2019blobs\u2019) that should be important. This topic is taken\nup again later.\nReturning to the whole sky, the North-South difference\nis also of interest. The net coefficient from the North (pos-\nitive b) is +28.0 and that from the South is +38.7; again\nan S-excess. Unfortunately, it is not clear how to work out\nthe statistical significance of this result, except to say that\nit is in the correct sense. What can be done, however, is to\nrotate the CMB map and rework the correlations.\nThis has been done and we have gone further to the\nextent of examining the correlation between the CR-CMB\ncorrelation coefficient and \u2206T , this has been done because\nwe expect the coefficient to be higher in the regions of posi-\ntive excess temperature if, as is expected, CR (-like) effects\ngive additional signals.\nThe latitude region can be divided into two ranges, as\nusual: |b| < 10\u25e6 and |b| > 10\u25e6. For the former, all 3-latitude\nbands show significant positive signals (averaged over \u2206T ),\nfor both N and S. Furthermore, the profile of the correlation\nof the coefficient, C(\u2206T ), with \u2206T is similar in the N and\nthe S. In the rotated maps the similarity between N and\nS is usually only strong in the region |b| < 2\u25e6, and occurs\nbecause of the correlation between adjacent bands \u2013 it will\nclearly be a maximum for such a narrow band, of width only\n2\u25e6. Taking the average amplitude alone, the chance of seeing\npositive signals of the magnitude seen or greater is estimated\nto be < 1%. The shape similarity (or coefficient vs \u2206T in the\nN and the S) will reduce this probability somewhat further,\nas will be demonstrated.\nContinuing to higher latitudes, |b| = 20\u25e6 \u2212 30\u25e6 and\n|b| > 60\u25e6 show small positive average coefficients whereas\n|b| = 30\u25e6 to 45\u25e6 and |b| = 45\u25e6 \u2212 60\u25e6 show small negative\ncorrelations. Before writing off evidence for a genuine CR-\nCMB correltion coefficient vs temperature at |b| > 20\u25e6,from\nthis particular analysis, however, we draw attention to three\nfeatures:\ni) In the S region (our preferred hemisphere for extra con-\ntributions) there is a distinct increase in correlation coeffi-\ncient with increasing \u2206T in each of the 4 |b| ranges. In the\nrotated maps this happens in only 20% of the individual\ncases and in less than 10% for each in a set of 4.\nii) From past arguments, we expect there to be a corre-\nlation between the CR intensity and the \u2019power per unit\nsolid angle\u2019 at small \u2113. The average temperature has a bigger\ncontribution from the high temperature, spatially condensed\nregions, regions which we do not expect to be affected \u2013 ex-\ncept in their base level \u2013 by CR (-like) effects. Taking all\ndata at |b| > 20\u25e6 we have examined the correlation of the\nCR-CMB correlation coefficient with the mean power for the\nbin (Figure 3, \u2113=10). The coefficient is positive at the 15%\nlevel.\niii) The behaviour above |b|=45\u25e6 has relevance to the situ-\nation for \u2206TCMB referred to earlier and to the work consid-\nered in Wolfendale & Zhang (1994), viz the presence of an\naxis of symmetry; inspection of the correlation coefficients\n(Figure 8) for |b| = 45\u25e6 shows pseudo-Galactic N and S poles\nat: l, b = 80\u25e6, +55\u25e6; 220\u25e6,\u221255\u25e6. These directions are those\nof the maxima in the two hemispheres beyond |b| = 45\u25e6.\nThey are reassuringly close to those for \u2206T . The uncertainty\nin angle is, again, approximately \u00b125\u25e6.\nThe second approach, referred to above, has been made,\nusing smaller spatial regions for the correlations. This in-\nvolves comparing the appearance of the genuine WMAP and\nthose for artifical universes. Two features in Figure 8 are\nconsidered by us to provide the evidence for a bona fide cor-\nrelation of CR with CMB: the excess in the Galactic Plane\nand the presence of symmetry about the plane.\nFor the genuine map we derive the integrated length of\nlongitude for which the CMB temperatures are above the\n\u2019red\u2019 minimum (\u2206T > 300\u00b5K). This is 115\u25e6 for the WMAP\nand, for the artificial universe, the mean is 33\u25e6 \u00b1 17\u25e6. Thus,\nformally, the WMAP effect is at 5 standard deviations. The\nsignificance is almost certainly less than that for a Gaussian\ndistribution, but is it probably greater than corresponding\nto a 1% probability of being spurious. For symmetry we\ncount the number of symmetrical regions of length at least\n\u2206l = 10\u25e6. There are 7 symmetrical regions compared with\n2.0 \u00b1 1.4 for the artificial universes,ie a 3.6 standard devia-\ntion effect. The corresponding chance probability is almost\ncertainly less than 5%.\nContinuing to higher latitudes, we find, at |b|=30\u25e6 and\n60\u25e6, integrated red regions significant to the extent of 2.8\nsigma and 2.6 sigma in comparison with the artificial uni-\nverse results.\nOur conclusion from this large scale CR-CMB correla-\ntion vs \u2019temperature\u2019 study is that it exists.\n10 T. Wibig and A. W. Wolfendale\n3.7 Restricted region studies at the highest\nenergies\nEGRET data are available to 30 GeV for a restricted region,\n|b| < 10\u25e6, and a correlation analysis has been made here.\nAgain, because of the strong b-dependence of the gamma\nray intensity, we take narrow bands of latitude. The results\nare shown in Figure 9. Although the spread is large there is\na clear correlation of the high energy EGRET flux and the\nCMB excursions, for the region away from the very lowest\nGalactic latitudes, viz |b| = 60\u25e6 \u2212 10\u25e6.\nWe would not have expected correlations for |b| < 2\u25e6\n(and to a lesser extent for 2\u25e6 \u2212 6\u25e6) where the lines of sight\nare very long and where there is considerable \u2019confusion\u2019.\nFor 6\u25e6 < |b| < 10\u25e6, where we expect the best correlation\nfollowing the arguments contributing to Figure 7, the slope\nis 2.2 standard deviations from zero taking all the data and\nsignificantly more for the (CR-favoured) S hemisphere, with\nsmaller significance for the North.\n3.8 Indirect studies of a CR-CMB Correlation for\n|b| > 10\u25e6\nCircumstantial evidence comes from N-S, b-dependence ef-\nfect and Quadrant differences.\nFor CR-related effects we would expect:\nA southern excess; mean for Q2>mean for Q3; a fall-off\nwith increasing latitude, where the quantity under examina-\ntion is either the power at low \u2113 or the mean temperature.\nThe results are, for Q1, 2 and 3 (Q4 is omitted, because\nof the \u2019big blue hole\u2019)\n1. Power at \u2113=10. S\/N>1, Q2<Q3, Figure 2; fall-off with\nincreasing |b| (figure 3)\n2. Mean CMB temperature. Southern excess S-N = 30\u00b5K,\nsimilar for both Q2 and Q3. Q2 \u2212 Q3 = +60\u00b5K. A fall-off\nof \u3008T \u3009 with increasing |b| from as far as |b| = 45\u25e6 (from right\ndown to |b| = 2\u25e6 \u2212 6\u25e6).\nEvidently, most of the features expected do occur, the\nonly exceptions being the reversal of Q2>Q3 seen for the\n\u2113=10 power intensity and the termination of the fall in \u3008T \u3009\nwith increasing |b| at 45\u25e6. The former is considered later in\nSect. 4. The last mentioned is interesting in its own right.\nIt is seen in all Quadrants (Figure 4) and usually for both\nN and S. It is germane to remark that the 408 MHz and 5\nindividual WMAP frequency plots all show an upturn (or\nconstancy) of intensity at |b| = 60\u25e6, in order of increasing\n|b|. In our case, for the N, the increase (for Q\u2019s 1,2 and 3) is\n51 \u00b5K whereas for the South it is +3\u00b5K; in the 408 MHz\nand WMAP frequencies, 4 out of the 5 sets of data which\nshow an increase have a bigger effect in the North. In the\npower spectrum, \u2113=10, data (Figure 4) there is an increase\nin 4 out of 6 cases although that for the South exceeds that\nfrom the North.\n3.9 Summary of the CR-related - CMB\ncorrelations\nIt is concluded that for |b| < 10\u25e6 there is good evidence for\na correlation of some form; each and every analysis shows\nan effect. The overall chance probability is less than about\n2%.\nIn the range |b| = 10\u25e6 to 20\u25e6 there is ambiguity, epit-\nomized by the systematically low intensities in the power\nspectrum for both \u2113 = 10 and \u2113=100. This is reflected in\n\u3008\u2206T \u3009only if Q4 is included. Without it, the mean tempera-\nture for |b| = 10\u25e6 \u2212 20\u25e6 is only a little above zero.\nMoving to |b| > 20\u25e6 there is evidence for a correlation\nof CR with either power intensity (at \u2113 = 10) or \u3008\u2206T \u3009but\nthe most direct evidence comes from the deficit in \u3008\u2206T \u3009 in\nthe special regions (Galactic chimneys and regions of steep\nCR spectrum) and the excess in the SNR shock regions.\nInsofar as the special regions cover the range |b| = 10\u25e6\u221220\u25e6,\ntoo, there is evidence for correlations here, too, despite the\nambiguities referred to above. The overall chance probability\nis, conservatively, at the 2% level.\n4 COMBINATION OF EXTERNAL AND\nINTERNAL STUDIES OF THE WMAP\nBy \u2018external\u2019 we mean the comparison of the WMAP data\nwith cosmic ray parameters and by \u2018internal\u2019 we mean a\ncomparison of WMAP data within itself, eg N-S asymmetry,\nb-dependence.\nThe largest effect concerning non-uniformity relates to\nlow latitudes, typically |b| < 10\u25e6, or somewhat wider. Both\ninternally and externally there are differences at low lati-\ntudes; a Galactic origin is surely very likely here which may,\nor may not, be CR-related. The main question to be ad-\ndressed is \u201care there foreground effects beyond |b| = 10\u25e6 or,\nin view of the anomalous region |b| = 10\u25e6\u2212 20\u25e6, beyond 20\u25e6\nThis aspect will now be addressed in some detail.\nThe evidence favouring CR-related effects at |b| >\n20\u25e6can be summarised as follows:\ni) The deficit in the mean WMAP temperature associated\nwith the regions of steep CR spectra and low HI column\ndensities are quite significant, and extend to |b| \u2248 60\u25e6.\nii) The excess for the North Polar Spur similarly extends\nto b = +60\u25e6. It, too, is significant.\niii) The large scale CR-CMB correlation adds a little weight\n- at least at the 3% significance level (although the absence\nof much correlation in the Inner Galaxy is a worry).\niv) The N-S symmetry is large at small \u2113 (for the power\nspectrum) and continues to |b| \u223c 55\u25e6 \u2212 60\u25e6, after which\nit falls. This is mirrored by the 408 MHz signal and by the\nindividual WMAP data for the various frequencies. It is gen-\nerally agreed that the |b|-dependence of the 408 MHz and\nthe individual WMAP data sets is due to CR-related Galac-\ntic foreground and the low \u2113 power spectrum asymmetry\npresumably has the same cause.\nv) The form of the actual latitude dependence of various\nparameters presumably also has the same cause. For the five\nfrequencies the ratio of \u2206T (20\u25e6\u2212 30\u25e6) to \u2206T (90\u25e6) is 2.1 (it\nfalls slowly with increasing frequency from 2.3 to 1.9). Our\nratio for the power at \u2113 = 10 is 1.7, ie 1.3 for the root\nmean square temperature. The ratio for larger \u2113-values will\nbe smaller. The relationship between the longitude-averaged\n\u2206T values for the five frequencies and that for\n\u221a\n\u2206T 2 for\nsmall \u2113 (\u2113 = 10) is not completely clear but if the \u2206T fluc-\ntuations are a constant fraction of the total DC signal then\nthe \u20192.1\u2019 is to be compared with the \u20191.3\u2019. Taken at its face\nvalue it would mean that the maps were cleaned to the ex-\ntent of a factor 4 - and a greater factor at higher \u2113 (eg by \u223c 8\nForeground contributions to the Cosmic Microwave Background 11\nat \u2113 = 30, using Figure 1d). These factors relate to |b| > 20\u25e6\nwhere most of the CMB signal used for cosmological anal-\nyses resides. A lack of cleaning to the extent derived (25%\nof the signal at \u2113 = 10 being CR-related noise) at \u2113 \u223c 10 is\nclearly serious.\nvi) At the highest latitude the consistency of the maximum\nintensity, from one parameter to another, adds confidence.\nvii) A comparison of both \u3008T \u3009 and power (for \u2113 \u223c 10) for\nQ2 and Q3 gives understandable results in terms of Galactic\nphenomena.\n5 APPLICATION TO COSMOLOGY\n5.1 General Remarks\nIn the absence of clear evidence as to the exact origin of the\nforeground responsible for the various anomalies in the CMB\nmap it is not possible to correct for it and make an updated\ncosmological interpretation. However, some progress can be\nmade by looking in detail at three important parameters:\n- the height of the \u2019one-degree peak\u2019;\n- the \u2113-value of the peak, and\n- the amplitude of the power spectrum at low \u2113 (\u2113 < 10).\n5.2 The height of the one-degree peak\nFigure 10 shows the power spectrum for the whole data used\nby us. Also shown is what is generally regarded as the stan-\ndard form as given by the WMAP workers themselves (and\na curve 10% below this). We note that \u2019our\u2019 value is low.\nInterestingly it is nearer to the conclusions drawn from pre-\nWMAP observations (see Komatsu et al. (2003)). Specifi-\ncally, the heights of \u2113(\u2113+ 1)C\u2113\/2\u03c0(\u00b5K\n2) are:\n- WMAP group (Bennett et al. 2003b) 5700\n- previous work [(Komatsu et al. 2003)] 4925 \u00b1 175\n- present work 4250 (whole sky) 3490 (|b| > 10\u25e6, scaled\nup).\nThe difference in height of the peak between our value\nusing the data of Tegmark et al. (2003)and the datum\nBennett et al. (2003b) is seen to be at least 25% and there-\nfore serious.\nTurning to the variations from Quadrant to Quadrant\nand N to S, Figures 1 and 2 indicate that these are (at\n\u2113 \u223c 200) of order 10%; similarly, Figure 5 suggests that the\nobserved peak is some 10% too high, in the sense that the\nred (with extra signals) and blue (without) differ such as to\ngive this difference.\nThere are two ways forward at this juncture, the first\nis to assume that our derived value of 3490 (less 10%),\nie 3140 \u00b5K2 is correct and the other that there is a sys-\ntematic displacement in the scale of the result derived us-\ning the cleaned data of Tegmark et al. (2003), and that we\nshould take 90% of the WMAP groups\u2019 result Bennett et al.\n(2003b); Hinshaw et al. (2003), viz 0.9\u00d7 5700 = 5130\u00b5K2 .\nThe implication of a low peak value is most likely that\n\u2126m, the mass content of the universe, should be reduced,\nalthough we appreciate that other variants to the cosmo-\nlogical parameters can be taken. Nevertheless, a reduced\npeak height is most easily achieved by increasing \u2126m (or\nspecifically \u2126mh\n2) (Hu 2003). A peak height of 3590 \u00b5K2\nwould indicate \u2126mh\n2 = 0.40, a very high value, and 5130\n\u00b5K2 yields \u2126mh\n2 = 0.20, itself significantly higher than the\n\u2019standard value\u2019.\n5.3 The \u2113-value of the one-degree peak\nLess susceptible to systematic errors is the \u2113-value of the\npeak. Conventionally it is at \u2113A = 220 but it is apparent\nthat our result is systematically lower.\nValues have been derived for |b| > 10\u25e6 for the Quad-\nrants, by fitting a \u2019standard shape\u2019 of W(\u2113), derived from\nthe whole data. The values are:\n- Quadrant 1 205\u00b1 10;\n- Quadrant 2 180\u00b1 10;\n- Quadrant 3 190\u00b1 10;\n- Quadrant 4 210\u00b1 10\ngiving a best-estimate of 196\u00b1 5. This value is 24\u00b1 5 lower\nthan the conventional 220. Using the expression \u2206\u2113A\/\u2113A =\n-0.24 \u2206\u2126mh\n2 (Hu 2003) and a datum of \u2126mh\n2 = 0.15, we\nhave \u2206\u2126mh\n2 = 0.17, ie \u2126mh\n2=0.22.\nAn alternative approach is by way of Figure 5. Again,\nusing the blue spectrum we have \u2113A = 200 \u00b1 10, ie \u2206\u2113A =\n\u221220\u00b110 and \u2206\u2126mh2 = 0.06, ie \u2126mh2 = 0.21. The estimated\nerror is \u00b10.05.\n5.4 The situation at low \u2113-values\nIt is well know that there is a loss of power below \u2113 = 10\nin comparison with conventional expectation (Bennett et al.\n2003b) and this has given rise to speculation of \u2019new physics\u2019\n(eg Efstatiou (2003)). One possibility is that it is \u2019mere\u2019 cos-\nmic variance that is responsible and it is true that this is\nlarge at low \u2113-values. The big differences from Quadrant to\nQuadrant, both for low and high latitudes, have relevance\nhere; they show that there may be genuine differences. How-\never, these may be due to CR-related foregrounds insofar as\nthe deviations from one Quadrant to another are bigger in\nthe region |b| < 10\u25e6.\nAt first sight there is evidence for an even greater fall\noff of power at low \u2113 with increasing latitude so that, in\nthe absence of a cosmic-variance-inspired effect, the anomaly\nmight be thought to be secure. However, we are struck by\nthe results in Figure 5 which shows a near-normal power\nlaw intensity at low \u2113-for the blue regions, ie the favoured\nset of data. Although the peak of the blue curve is low, from\n\u2113 = 100 downwards, the form of the blue curve mirrors that\nof the conventional prediction all the way down to the lowest\nvalues of \u2113. A possibility is that the form of the foreground\ncontribution is such as to reduce the apparent power at low\n\u2113-; we remember that the total temperature variations are\nnormalized to zero.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nThe major conclusion from this work is that there are fea-\ntures of the WMAP of the fluctuations in the CMB that\nare not related to the early universe, but are due to a \u2019fore-\nground\u2019. Some of the foreground at least is surely of Galactic\norigin and it appears to exist at all Galactic latitudes.\nLarge scale asymmetries (also seen by others) exist on\n12 T. Wibig and A. W. Wolfendale\nscales of North vs South and Quadrant to Quadrant. Our\nunderstanding of them is limited but guidance seems to come\nfrom correlations of the mean temperature, and intensity of\nthe power spectrum, with cosmic ray features.\nThe implications for cosmology are complex, but some\nremarks can be made, as follows:\n1. Presently derived cosmological constants are more un-\ncertain than usually appreciated.\n2. If it is assumed that the only parameter to be adjusted\nis the universal mass fraction \u2126mh\n2 then there is evidence for\nit being larger than the canonical 0.15. Two of our analyses\nsuggest that it is\u223c0.22 \u00b10.05. Another analysis gives a value\nas high as 0.40. It is premature, however, to put much weight\non this very high value. Nevertheless, a value higher than the\ncanonical \u2126mh\n2 = 0.15 is preferred. Of course, variations of\nthe values of other cosmological parameters are possible, but\nsuch variations would also be of great interest.\n3. The situation at low \u2113 is interesting and our analysis\nsuggests that the more conventional view may prevail, viz\nthat the apparent missing power may be an artifact.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are grateful to W.J.

Map of the correlation coefficients with the separate Quadrants identified (Galactic scale as in Fig. 6). The units of the correlation\ncoefficients are 10\u22122. The latitude ranges are: |b| < 2\u25e6, 2\u25e6\u2212 6\u25e6, 6\u25e6\u2212 10\u25e6, 10\u25e6\u2212 20\u25e6, 20\u25e6\u2212 30\u25e6, 30\u25e6\u2212 45\u25e6, 45\u25e6\u2212 60\u25e6 and above 60\u25e6, with\nsimilar divisions (below b = \u22122\u25e6) for negative latitudes. Although the statistical precision of any individual coefficient is poor there are\nsome important patterns, most notably that there is a stronger correlation in the Outer Galaxy, particularly in Quadrant 2 (in which\nall astronomical indicators are stronger), and that there is a concentration in the Galactic Plane. We think that the large gamma ray\ncontribution from Inverse Compton interactions and other factors, may have spoiled the correlation in the Inner Galaxy.\n20 T. Wibig and A. W.
