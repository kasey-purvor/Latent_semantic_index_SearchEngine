Yet it is often criticised as a Western concept celebrating \nindividualism and independence over group obligations and \ninterdependence or dependence. This paper rejects this view and argues \nthat coherent accounts of autonomy must always recognize the \ninterdependence of people in groups, and that autonomy can coexist with \nsubstantial relationships of dependence. It illustrates this drawing on \nevidence from Bangladesh, a poor country usually absent from cross-\ncultural studies and one where personal relationships of hierarchy and \ndependence are endemic. Argument and evidence is presented showing the \ncoexistence of personal autonomy and dependence, and the relationship \nbetween collective action and autonomy. We also address some of the \nspecific problems encountered in researching autonomy in a social context \nwhere it is mainly expressed in relational forms. We conclude that autonomy \ncan be directed toward both personal and social goals, and can be enacted \nindividually, or by participation in groups. Autonomy is a universal \npsychological need but its expression is always contextual. \n \nKey Words: - Autonomy, relationships, Banglades h, eudaimonic wellbeing, \nindividualism and collectivism. \n \nKey Readings:- Doyal, L. and Gough, I. 1991, A Theory of Human Need \n(MacMillan, Basingstoke). \nDevine, J.: 2004, 'Change and the everyday politics of community based \norganisations', Paper presented at Membership Based Organizations of the Poor \nWorkshop, Organized by Cornell-SEWA-WIEGO at Ahmedabad, India, Jan 2004. \nCamfield, L., Choudhury, K., and Devine, J.: 2006, 'Poor but Happy - an exploration \nof the cultural construction of happiness in Bangladesh', (Submitted to Journal for \nHappiness of Studies). \n \nAcknowledgements:- We are grateful to Des Gasper, Severine Deneulin, Ed Deci, \nand an anonymous reviewer for insightful comments on earlier drafts.

Finnis (1980) includes \n\u2018practical reason\u2019 or \u2018authentic self-direction\u2019 as a basic human value; for \nGriffin (1996) \u2018agency\u2019 is a core prudential value; for Nussbaum (2000) \n\u2018practical reason\u2019 is a central human functioning capability; for Sen (2002) \n\u2018process freedom\u2019 is of equal importance to outcomes in evaluating well-\nbeing; for Doyal and Gough (1991) \u2018autonomy\u2019 is a basic human need, a \nuniversal precondition for any individual action in any culture.1  \n \nAutonomy is also central to those psychologists exploring eudaimonic \nconceptions of well-being, the subject of this Special Issue. Ryff (1989), \nproviding a \u2018parsimonious summary\u2019 of the stream of writers on \npsychological well-being, contends that the notion of positive well-being \ncomprises six dimensions, including \u2018autonomy\u2019, and the related notions of \n\u2018environmental mastery\u2019 and \u2018self-actualization\u2019. Ryan and Deci (2000, 2001) \ngo further and firmly distinguish eudaimonic well-being from hedonic well-\nbeing, the former comprising notions of meaningfulness and self-realization. \nThree universal psychological needs are identified for such psychological \ngrowth and integrity, one of which is autonomy - the evolved propensity to \nself-regulate one\u2019s actions, a propensity that is experientially associated \nwith feeling integrated and acting with intention. One crucial feature of the \ndistinction between eudaimonic and hedonic well-being is that \u2018from the \neudaimonic perspective, subjective happiness cannot be equated with well-\nbeing\u2019 (Ryan and Deci, 2001, p.146).  This parallels the arguments in Doyal \nand Gough and other writers on autonomy: to say that autonomy is a basic \nneed, or a basic human value, or a basic psychological need is to say that \nhuman well-being cannot be entirely captured by notions of happiness, life \nsatisfaction, or subjective well-being. It implies that a person can be happy \nbut experience low levels of autonomy, and conversely that a highly \nautonomous person can be anxious, troubled, dissatisfied, unhappy. In \norder to better understand this interaction, the nature of autonomy must be \nexplored and clarified and, just as important, its extent operationalised and \nmeasured.  \nOne powerful challenge to its status comes from writers who argue that it is \na Western concept with little applicability to the lives of people across much \n \n1\n Alkire (2002, chapter 2) supplies an exhaustive account and insightful interpretation of \nFinnis, Griffin, Sen, and other philosophical writers on wellbeing). \n  4 \n \nof the world. The fact that all of the above approaches derive from Western \nintellectual traditions underpins challenges that question its coherence and \nsuitability as a concept for understanding well-being in developing countries. \nIt is claimed inter alia that the notion fails to capture the cultural specificity of \nthese settings and rests on an assumption about independent man (sic) that \nsits awkwardly with the reality of life in many societies (Christopher, 1999). \nIn particular, more collectivist societies and cultures are claimed to value \ninterdependence or even dependence and pursue group obligations rather \nthan individual autonomy (Diener and Suh, 2000; Rozin, 1999; Uchida et al., \n2004). \n \nThe purpose of this article is to address this issue and to set these \narguments alongside evidence from Bangladesh, one of the poorest \ncountries in the world2. It draws on research ideas and findings from the \nESRC Research Group on Well-being in Developing Countries (WeD) at the \nUniversity of Bath, and is the outcome of an ongoing debate within the \ngroup3. We draw mainly on primary data collected for the Quality of Life \n(QoL) component of the WeD research. This is supplemented with \nsecondary data and analysis that have emerged from ongoing research into \na collective action group in Bangladesh (Devine 2002, 2004). The QoL \ncomponent entailed three distinct phases. In the first phase, the primary aim \nwas to identify key categories and components of quality of life for different \nindividuals in different locations. The second phase was conceptual in \nnature and sought to reflect on the findings of the first phase. In the third \nphase, a specific measure of QoL was developed by WeD researchers and \napplied in all the research sites4.  \n \nDuring the first phase of the QoL work in Bangladesh, a variety of research \ntools were deployed including semi-structured interviews (n = 73), focus \n \n2\n The choice of a South Asian country like Bangladesh is interesting in its own right as the \nmajority of comparative studies on autonomy are between the USA, and the supposedly \ncollectivist societies of Japan, Hong Kong, China, or Korea (Oyserman et al 2002, Uchida et \nal 2004). \n3\n See www.welldev.org.uk for more details of the Wellbeing in Developing Countries (WeD) \nresearch program. \n4\n WeD carries out research in four countries: Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Peru and Thailand. While \ndifferent countries adopted different methods in of exploring and defining quality of life (QoL), \nthe QoL instrument developed from this data was administered in all the sites.  \n  5 \n \ngroup discussion (n = 240), the Person Generated Index (n = 42) (Ruta et \nal, 2004), and a Global Happiness Question (n = 73). The research for \nphase one took place over a period of one year (January to December \n2004) and was developed in iteration with findings emerging from other \naspects of the overall WeD research program5. The main criteria used to \nselect respondents and participants for the QoL research were gender, age, \nrural and urban residence, religious affiliation, and economic differences. \nThe data used specifically in this article relate to two broad areas of enquiry \nof the first phase:  \n\u00b7 An exploration of the goals, values, motivations, and future \naspirations of young urban Bangladeshi women (Choudhury, 2006), \nsupplemented by responses to the semi-structured interview \nschedule by a sample of urban Bangladeshi women aged 20 to 65.  \n\u00b7 People\u2019s responses to interview and focus group questions about \ncharacteristics of households and individuals living well or living \nbadly; individual experiences of happiness and unhappiness; \nindividual hopes and fears; and finally, people\u2019s views on what \nconstitutes an ideal village or community (Camfield et al., 2006). \n \nThe article proceeds in the following stages. First, the opposition between \nautonomy and interdependence is set out, focusing on theories of universal \nbasic needs as well as critiques and alternative propositions derived mainly \nfrom literature on South Asia. The next three sections develop the counter-\nargument, supported with evidence from prior studies and from our fieldwork \nin Bangladesh. Section two develops our central argument that the \nantinomy between autonomy and interdependence is a false one. Drawing \non approaches to basic needs and psychological needs, and on arguments \nand evidence from South Asia, we develop the idea that autonomy can only \nbe realised though interdependence, and show that people can value both \nautonomy and dependence. The third section argues that an \nenvironmentally contextual notion of autonomy requires, and is best \n \n5 \nWeD research involves a number of survey type instruments as well as more process-\norientated work. During the initial phase of the QoL research, researchers were also \nconsolidating community profiles for each of the research sites, administering a Resources \nand Needs Questionnaire, and collecting data through observation and other participatory \ntechniques. One of the characteristics  of the WeD program is that the research components \nare not treated as stand-alone projects, but are considered interdependent and mutually \nreinforcing.   \n  6 \n \nevaluated across, different domains of life. In the fourth section we consider \nthe role of collective action in enhancing the autonomy of individuals. The \nfinal section concludes by confirming that autonomy is a universal goal, but \nis to be conceived and appraised as multiple situated autonomies. In poor, \ncollectivist societies such as Bangladesh it is frequently expressed and \nachieved through significant horizontal and vertical relationships. The need \nis to move beyond the sterile autonomy-interdependence opposition to \nexplore the choice of alternative goals and of intentional actions to achieve \nthem within specific contexts. \n \nAutonomy, Interdependence, and Needs \n \nWe begin with the analysis of autonomy presented by one of us in A Theory \nof Human Need (Doyal and Gough 1991, henceforth THN). At the most \nbasic level, autonomy (deriving from the Greek \u2018self\u2019 + \u2018rule\u2019) refers to \u201cthe \nability to make informed choices about what should be done and how to go \nabout doing it. This entails being able to formulate aims and beliefs about \nhow to achieve them, along with the ability to evaluate the success of those \nbeliefs in the light of empirical evidence\u201d (THN, p. 53). This minimal level of \nautonomy is labelled \u2018autonomy of agency\u2019. It begins to develop within \nchildren at an early age and is possessed to some degree by all humans.  \n \nTHN (p. 63) goes on to present a more detailed list of components. \nGenerally speaking, the existence of even minimal levels of autonomy will \nentail the following: \na) that actors have the intellectual capacity to formulate aims and \nbeliefs common to their form of life;  \nb) that actors have enough confidence to want to act and thus to \nparticipate in some form of social life; \nc) that actors actually do act by seeking to achieve their aims and \nbeliefs ; \nd) that actors perceive their actions as having been done by them \nand not by someone else; \ne) that actors are able to understand the empirical constraints on the \nsuccess of their actions; \nf) that actors are capable of taking responsibility for what they do. \n \nTHN also argues that autonomy of agency will be impaired if three \nconditions pertain: firstly, if people lack sufficient understanding of their \n  7 \n \nculture and its expectations; secondly, if they lack the psychological \ncapacity to formulate opinions, as in the case of severe mental illness; and \nthirdly, if their opportunities to participate in significant social activities are \nblocked. At this abstract level everyone, except those in long-term coma \nand with advanced degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s, possess \nsome degree of autonomy. But differences of degree can be established \naccording to how far these six characteristics are present and how far the \nthree preconditions are absent. This account is broadly in line with other \naccounts of autonomy in the philosophical and related literatures, such as \nthose listed above. For example, Sen (2002) defines agency as the ability of \npersons to act on behalf of goals that matter to them (see Robeyns 2003). \n \nHowever, THN goes on to recognize a higher-order level of autonomy, \nlabelled critical autonomy. \u201cCritical autonomy entails the capacity to \ncompare cultural rules, to reflect upon the rules of one\u2019s own culture, to \nwork with others to change them and, in extremis, to move to another \nculture\u201d (THN, p. 187). Compared with autonomy of agency, critical \nautonomy entails some questioning of normally taken-for-granted rules, \nhabits and practices \u2013 a person\u2019s habitus, in Bourdieu\u2019s terms (1977). This \ndraws on Dworkin, who distinguishes between autonomy as \u201ca second-\norder capacity of persons to reflect critically upon their first-order \npreferences, desires, wishes, and so forth\u201d and \u201cthe capacity to accept or \nattempt to change these in light of higher-order preferences and values\u201d \n(Dworkin, 1988, p. 20).6  \n \nSuch concepts of autonomy have been described as encapsulating a \ndominant Western conception of \u2018the person\u2019 (Geertz, 1984), as a product of \nWestern individualism (Markus and Kitayama, 1991), and as inscribing a \nWestern normative conception of the good (Christopher, 1999). According \nto some scholars these biases limit the applicability of the notion of \nautonomy to other cultures. This is especially so in South Asia where \nhierarchical and collectivist values appear to be stronger, and where \n\u2018adherence to controlling pressures\u2019 is associated with greater satisfaction \n \n6\n THN\u2019s distinction between autonomy of agency, which is often \u2018critical\u2019, and critical \nautonomy proper, which requires political freedom, now seems too static. Empowerment \noften comes through struggle and the process of struggle in unfree societies can expand \ncritical autonomy in major ways. Indeed, apathy in formally free societies can constrict it. In \npractice critical autonomy as defined above can occur in unfree societies. \n  8 \n \nand adaptive outcomes than the \u2018absence of all exogenous influences\u2019 \n(Miller, 1997 in Chirkov et al., 2003). This line of reasoning has been \npursued in discussions of Bangladesh. For example, Wilce (1998) argues \nthat autonomy is not an ideal goal that people value and strive after. Instead \npeople are far more aware of and concerned about the effectiveness of their \ninterpersonal, intergenerational, and inter-group relations because these \nrepresent the crucial locus of power and identity and pervade the entire \ngamut of life activities. Crucially for the argument presented here many of \nthese relations are underpinned by values of deference and hierarchy, and \noften foster subservient behaviour. This raises the important but as yet \nunexplored question about the extent to which levels of constraint or \ncoercion in particular cultural contexts (and this does not only apply to so-\ncalled collectivist cultures) impinge on the way people endorse or enact the \nneed for autonomy (Madhok 2005). In her analysis of gender relations in \nBangladesh (undoubtedly a specific context where the level of constraint is \nmarked), White (1992) proposes that the notion of \u2018centrality\u2019 may be a more \nappropriate idiom than autonomy to understand the way people conceive of \nand strategize around their needs. Unlike autonomy, the notion of centrality \ngives analytical priority to people\u2019s inter-relational milieu, and assumes that \npeople - and indeed life - are fundamentally defined in relationships. From \nthis perspective, autonomy can even be seen to characterize a bereft \ncondition in which the opportunity for meaningful participation in life is \nthwarted (Devine, 2004).  \n \nThe argument that we should privilege more the inter-relational and \ninterdependent milieu in contexts like South Asia recalls an older debate \nhighlighted in Dumont\u2019s notion of homo hierarchicus, in which the self is \nregarded as part of a fixed hierarchical order and not as an impermeable \nperson with individual needs. The oft-quoted statement of Dumont puts the \ncase succinctly:  \nTo say that the world of caste is a world of relations is to say \nthat the particular caste and the particular man have no \nsubstance: they exist empirically, but they have no reality in \nthought, no being\u2026at the risk of being crude\u2026on the level of \nlife in the world the individual is not (Dumont, 1970, p. 272, \nemphasis in original)  \n \nDumont\u2019s assertion is also a classic central reference point for a wider \ndebate about what of human nature and experience is universal and what is \n  9 \n \nculturally specific.7 In examining the expression of self in other cultures, \nsome scholars have raised concerns about the notion of the individual \nunderstood as an autonomous and bounded self (Ewing, 1990; Geertz, \n1984; Marriot, 1976) and explained \u201cin terms of either shared biological or \npsychological processes of the organism\u201d (Murray, 1993, p. 6, emphasis in \noriginal). This conception of self is strongly associated with Western \nphilosophical and theological traditions that prioritize an essentialised and \nindividualist notion of person (Markus and Kitayama, 1991). In the \nalternative Dumontian perspective, individuals are subsumed in the social \nwhole - hierarchically embedded as opposed to autonomous actors, socio-\ncentred beings as opposed to ego-centred ones (Shweder and Bourne, \n1984). The basis for behaviour, action, and aspiration therefore arises from \nthe position one holds in the social order, which not surprisingly is \nmanipulated to ultimately serve the interests of super-ordinates. While there \nis much to criticize in ideas associated with homo hierarchicus, there is no \ndenying that in contexts like Bangladesh \u2018knowing one\u2019s position in the \nsocial order\u2019 is foundational to being and doing. Self therefore is socially \nconstructed and \u201ccan be conceived of as an unequally distributed privilege \nrather than as a biological given\u201d (Wilce, 1998, p. 40).  \n \nThus at some level, we seem to be confronted with an irreconcilable \nopposition between Western notions of and moral claims for autonomy as a \nuniversal human need, and non-Western ideas and endorsements of \ninterdependence or even dependence. In the next section we address these \nideas further and explore in some detail the possibility of a synthesis.  \n \nReconciling Human Autonomy and Interdependence \n \nImmanuel Kant, who first coined the word autonomy, also coined its \nopposite \u2018heteronomy\u2019 (derived from the Greek \u2018another\u2019 + \u2018rule\u2019) (Kant, \n1948 [1785]). This referred to situations where moral imperatives either \ncome from without (in the form of a deity, the state, or other people) or from \ncontingent drives or personal delusions (Honderich, 2005; Lindley, 1986). \nThe re-introduction of the notion of heteronomy offers an important \n \n7 \nDumont\u2019s assertion that the \u2018individual\u2019 self does not exist is germane to our discussion \nbecause of the proposition that autonomy is a universal human need (Doyal and Gough \n1991).  \n  10 \n \ncorrective that helps structure our subsequent discussion. While it is true \nthat some interpretations of autonomy do seem to equate autonomy with \nradical independence and self-sufficiency,8 for most writers such an \ninterpretation of autonomy cannot be sustained. It is therefore erroneous to \nequate autonomy with radical independence or individualism.  \n \nThe argument that autonomy implies a degree of dependence on other \nactors and external environments is made clearly in THN. To quote it at \nlength:  \nThe individualist interpretation divorces the actor from the social \nenvironment within which their personal identity evolves. All \nindividuals discover who they are through learning what they can \nand cannot do. Individual action is social to the extent that it must \nbe learned from and reinforced by others. Actors are socialised \ninto following rules - expressions of collectively held and enforced \naims and beliefs. These range from the obviously public (e.g., how \nto exchange one set of goods for another) to those which seem \nessentially private (e.g., bathing, toilet etiquette). Such rules \nconstitute the parameters of our sense of self and of others - our \nindividual vision of what (formally) is and is not privately and \npublicly possible. Thus the autonomy necessary for successful \naction is not compromised by the necessity to follow rules \u2013 quite \nthe opposite. It is precisely the normative constraints of our social \nenvironment which make the specific choice to do x rather than y a \nreal possibility (THN, p. 77). \n \nHowever, the argument that autonomy is constituted relationally and \ncontextually is not an endorsement of the kind of cultural determinism \nsuggested in Geertz\u2019s contention that \u201cthe shapes of knowledge are always \nineluctably local, indivisible from their instruments and their encasements\u201d \n(Geertz, 1984, p. 4). Rather it endorses a structuration approach, which \nhighlights the essentially recursive character of social life (Archer, 1988; \nGiddens, 1984). In other words, without individual capacity for action there \ncan be no social structure, and without social structure there can be no \nindividual capacity for action. It is for this reason that individual autonomy \n \n8\n Wolff, for example, appears to associate autonomy with independence: \u201cthe autonomous \nman, insofar as he is autonomous, is not subject to the will of another\u201d (Wolff 1970: 14).   \n  11 \n \nmust always be achieved in an institutional context, and this assumes \ninterdependence. Any concept of autonomy, which does not begin from this \nontological fact, is worthless.  \n \nChirkov et al. (2003) offered another perspective that is relevant to this \ndiscussion in their examination of the relative autonomy of cultural practices \nin South Korea, Russia, Turkey, and the United States. Working within the \nframework of Self Determination Theory (Ryan and Deci, 2000), they \noppose autonomy and heteronomy, as well as independence and \ndependence, arguing that these two dimensions are orthogonal. Autonomy \nis defined in a more experiential way, as \u201cwhen [a person\u2019s] behaviour is \nexperienced as willingly enacted and when he or she fully endorses the \nactions ... and\/or the values expressed by them\u201d (Chirkov et al., 2003, p. 98, \nafter Deci and Ryan, 1985). This allows them to bring autonomy and \ndependence together in a synergistic manner. Thus, they argue that in \ncertain circumstances \u201cone can be autonomously dependent on another, \nwillingly rely on his or her care, particularly if the other is perceived as \nsupportive and responsive\u201d (Chirkov et al., p. 98). They distinguish various \nmotives for action, which lie along a continuum of relative autonomy, using \nfour major categories that are drawn from Deci and Ryan: \n\u00b7 External regulation, where a person acts only to obtain external \nrewards or to escape punishment \n\u00b7 Introjected regulation, where a person acts to experience approval \nby self or others, or to avoid feelings of guilt or self-disparagement \n\u00b7 Identified regulation, where a person consciously endorses a given \nbehaviour or value as having personal significance and importance \n\u00b7 Integrated regulation, where the behaviour or value is integrated into \neveryday life and coordinated with one\u2019s other identifications. \n \nThe distinctions implied in these categories are useful for our discussion \nbecause they implicitly acknowledge that in specific circumstances different \npeople will exercise different degrees of autonomy. In turn this reinforces \nthe need for more empirical investigation. Thus, in the Chirkov et al. study, \nundertaken on university students in four different countries (Korea, Russia, \nTurkey, and the US), participants were asked to register their agreement or \ndisagreement with a variety of statements. The study found that participants \nrated their countries differently as predicted along individualistic-collectivistic \nand horizontal-vertical dimensions. However, they also varied considerably \nin the degree to which they internalised these ambient orientations. Thus \n  12 \n \npeople articulated a desire for authenticity within so-called collectivist \ncultures (suggesting the possibility of autonomy), and heteronomous desires \nwithin individualist cultures.9      \n \nThe Self Determination Theory framework therefore offers important insights \nthat are relevant to our argument here. First, it explicitly differentiates \nindependence and individualism from autonomy. Second, it acknowledges \nthe possibility that people can be autonomously interdependent (as the first \npoint implies). In the context of South Asia, we can find much evidence that \nthe synthesis of autonomy and interdependence is possible. In one review, \nAppadurai (1986) examines the contribution of three different authors who \ndemonstrate in different ways how people - often through struggle and \ncollective action \u2013 create a more positive conception of self for themselves. \nThis conception then becomes a stronger basis upon which to exercise \nautonomous action. Thus one of the books reviewed (Khare, 1984), \nexplores the way Untouchable communities in Lucknow use their social \ndependence to construct a coherent voice that facilitates autonomous \naction. In contrast to the Dumontian homo hierarchicus that privileges an \nunderlying and foundational ideology of hierarchy, unity, and karma, the \nUntouchables of Lucknow construct and build upon an ideology that Khare \nidentifies as \u2018equalitarian\u2019 and \u2018individualistic\u2019. Admittedly the conception of \nthe individual used here is different from that assumed in Western \ntraditions,10 but it enables the Untouchables to establish and achieve \ndefined goals in a more autonomous way. In this process, they effectively \nconvert their social dependence into a radical political resource that not only \nbecomes an ideological critique of their present situation, but also allows the \n \n9\n Chirkov et al\u2019s findings (2003), however, may relate more to the problematic nature of the \nbinary distinction between individualism and collectivism. For further details see Oyserman et \nal (2002) and Matsumoto (1999).  \n10\n To summarize Khare\u2019s argument, his conception of an individual has a more spiritual or \ntranscendental sens e. At this level, all individuals are equal. This sense of individual \ncontrasts with the figure of the \u2018caste person\u2019 that is pivotal to the ruthless hierarchical world \ndepicted by Dumont and others. The transcendental self becomes a cultural ideological \nconstruct that offers the Untouchables strategic opportunities for social redress in their \neveryday lives.  \n  13 \n \ncommunities of Lucknow to participate more fully in their respective social \ncontexts.11   \n \nThus we have good evidence that despite the prevalence of hierarchically \nstructured relationships that determine the basis for all human action, \npeople do achieve goals at interpersonal (del Franco, 2005), inter-familial \n(White, 1992) and inter-group (Devine, 2006) levels. By recognizing the co-\nexistence of autonomy and interdependence, we implicitly accept therefore \nthat there will be differences in the extent to which people can exercise \nautonomy. This is anticipated in the philosophical literature and elsewhere. \nFor example, Raz (1986) introduced a notion of significant autonomy, \nunderstood as the ability of people to shape their lives and determine their \ncourse, and argues that the ability of people to acquire it \u2018is a matter of \ndegree\u2019 (Raz, 1986, p. 154). Also and as discussed above, the framework \noffered by Self Determination Theory presents a continuum of relative \nautonomy that ranges from external regulation to integrated regulation. In a \nrecent study of Brazilian and Canadian students, Chirkov et al. (2005) apply \nthis thinking further and find that even where hierarchical or vertical cultural \narrangements dominate, there is evidence that people still exercise relative \nautonomy. Appadurai uses his review to argue that the value attached in the \nIndian context to hierarchy, interrelationship and dependence does not \npreclude the possibility that people can articulate goals and have the \nautonomy to act upon these. This is a position that resonates well with \nresearch carried out in Bangladesh. It is thus possible and indeed crucial to \nassess the degree of autonomy possessed by individuals \u2013 at least in \ntheory. We now turn to whether it is possible in practice.  \n \nEvidence from Bangladesh \n \nTwo questions need addressing to provide evidence on the co-\nexistence of personal autonomy and substantial social dependence in \nmodern-day Bangladesh: \n1. to what extent do Bangladeshis value autonomy? \n2. how is this expressed within relations of dependence? \n \n11\n Khare\u2019s observation of increased social participation among untouchables is important \nsince Dumont claimed that real autonomy was possible only for those who figuratively \u2018leave\u2019 \nor do not fully participate in society such as holy men, drop-outs, and so forth. \n  14 \n \n \nTo what extent do Bangladeshis value autonomy? Although respondents \nnever explicitly used the word autonomy, they expressed an appreciation of \nthe idea of autonomy in other terms. Thus in the urban data set (women \naged 20-65), women talked about the importance of having individual \nindependence (\u201cto be able to go where I want, to be free\u201d, \u201cfulfill [my] own \nhopes in life\u201d). Independence was facilitated by (1) remaining physically fit, \n(2) continuing to work outside the home, and (3) having self-sufficiency at \nthe household level (having your \u2018own\u2019 house, \u201cnot going to others to borrow \nsomething\u201d). Similarly many women emphasised a desire to be educated, \nhave a job, receive recognition from their family and community, be able to \nhelp others, live according to their principles, and have their own income \nand\/or assets. What unites all these statements is a strong sense of women \nseeking to have greater control over their lives.  \n \nA very similar pattern is discernible in the data from rural and peri-urban \nsites (men and women aged 19 and over). Here we find significant \ncommonality with all groups stressing the importance of key autonomy \ncharacteristics, albeit with different degrees of emphasis (see Table 1). For \nexample, potential indicators of autonomy are being able to work and \nprovide for your family\u2019s needs, leading or managing your household, being \nable to bring your children up well, being able to support your parents in \ntheir old age, having some degree of financial independence and\/ or \nmobility, and not being dependent on others. For some groups these could \nbe expanded to include participation in social assistance or community \ndevelopment, social status within the community, and involvement in \nhousehold decision-making.  \n \n  15 \n \nTable 1: Autonomy Characteristics Identified From the Data From the \nFirst Phase of the QoL Research in Rural Bangladesh \nOlder men Younger men Older women Young women \nCan provide for \nown and  family\u2019s \nneeds \nCan provide for \nown and  family\u2019s \nneeds \n Can provide for \nfamily and  \nchildren\u2019s daily \nneeds \nAble to work Able to work; can \nconcentrate on \nwork \nAble to work Can work \nindependently \nNot dependent on \nothers (physically \nor economically) \n Not dependent on \nchildren (physically \nor economically) \nSelf sufficient within \nthe home (e.g., own \nlatrine) (household \nnot dependent on \nothers) \nAcknowledged \nand  effective \nleader of \nhousehold (e.g., \nable to maintain \njoint household \nafter sons\u2019 \nmarriages) \nManages \nhousehold well \n \nAble to manage \nhome (e.g., can \nconcentrate on \nmany tasks at \nonce) \nChildren listen to \nher \nKnows how to \nperform household \nchores and manage \nhome \nConsulted by \nhusband; doesn\u2019t \nlive in joint \nhousehold so \nautonomous \ndecision making \nand\/ or \nparticipates in \nhousehold \ndecision making \n \nAble to bequeath \nproperty to \nchildren \n   \nBrought children \nup well \u2013 now \ngood, respected \nmembers of \ncommunity \nBrought children \nup well \u2013 now \ngood, respected \nmembers of \ncommunity (not \nsource of shame) \nand  prepared to \nprovide for \nparents in return  \nBrought children \nup well \u2013 now \ngood, respected \nmembers of \ncommunity (not \nsource of shame) \nand prepared to \nprovide for her in \nreturn  \nBrought children up \nwell \u2013 now good, \nrespected members \nof community (not \nsource of shame) \nand prepared to \nprovide for \nparents in return  \n  16 \n \n \nOlder men Younger men Older women Young women \nRespected by \ncommunity (e.g., \nfrequently \nconsulted, \nparticipates in \ncommunity \ndevelopment) \nRespected by \ncommunity  \n \n  \nGood social \nnetworks (e.g., \nwith extended \nfamily) \n   \n Pleases parents \n \nHusband alive and \nacting as \n\u2018autonomy \nsupport\u2019; takes \ncare of husband \n \nMaintains good \nrelationship with \nchildren \n \n Financially \nindependent; able \nto travel \nEarns a good \nincome \n \nOwn income\/ \nsavings, which \nenable her to meet \nher needs \nAble to come and \ngo as she wishes \nCan make \npurchases of her \nchoice; can buy \nthings for children \nand support natal \nhome from own \nincome  \n Educated  Can tutor children \nand\/ or be \ninvolved in their \neducation \nBold indicates specific to this category of respondent \n \nFor older men it was also important to be able to leave an inheritance to \ntheir children, be respected by their community, and participate in \ncommunity development. Being respected by their community was \nimportant to younger men, who also wanted to please their parents, and be \nable to study and travel. Younger women similarly wanted \u201cto come and go \nas she pleases\u201d, and also to work independently and be able to purchase \nthings for their children and their parents (whether they had their own \n  17 \n \nsource of income or not). In terms of interpersonal autonomy, they wanted \nto be consulted by their husband, participate in household decision-making, \nbe involved in their children\u2019s education, and have a good relationship with \ntheir children. In contrast, older women only wanted to be listened to by their \nchildren and take care of their husband (they were also the only group who \ndidn\u2019t mention providing for their family\u2019s needs, presumably because this \nisn\u2019t a realistic expectation).  \n \nAutonomy within dependence. A clear gender difference was evident: \nwomen\u2019s autonomy needs were more focused on other people and the \nquality of their relationships with them. For example, older women wanted to \nbe physically fit so they wouldn\u2019t be a burden on their children, and younger \nwomen wanted independent incomes so they could contribute to the \nhousehold. Women\u2019s experiences of autonomy were also centred on the \nhome, rather than say the market or community. This meant that even when \nthe scope of their autonomy extended beyond the home (for example, \nthrough reciprocal links with their natal family), the actual engagements still \ntook place in a domestic setting.  \n \nIn contrast, men\u2019s autonomy needs appeared to be more focussed on \nthemselves, and stressed much more the importance of developing \npersonal competence, self-efficacy, self-mastery, and so on. Thus more \nthan any other group young men emphasised their own education, even \nabove that of their children. They also expressed a desire to be \nacknowledged leaders of their households, which implies some form of \nsocial recognition that they have amassed particular qualities and skills.  \n \nInterestingly, in the peri-urban\/ rural data set young women only talked \nabout education in terms of being able to educate their children better, \nalthough it was clearly intrinsically important to young urban women. This \napparent difference in the value accorded to education may be artefactual, \nbut it may also represent a more fundamental gender difference of seeing, \nor at least talking about autonomy and other practices in terms of their \ninstrumental rather than their intrinsic value. For example, young women \nwanting to be educated in order to educate their children, or worshipping \nAllah so that he will take care of their families.  \n \nThese findings were supported by examples of autonomy experienced \nwithin relationships (\u2018centrality\u2019) from the urban dataset. For example, the \n  18 \n \nimportance of being consulted by one\u2019s sons and the \u2018psychological \ninsecurity\u2019 caused by not having children to look after you when you are \nolder. The family network appeared to be one of the main arenas in which \npeople exercise their autonomy and meet their basic needs, even the ones \nthat relate to autonomy (e.g., the importance of having a husband who \n\u201ctakes her consent for everything\u201d, i.e., who asks her to endorse every \ndecision, Choudhury, 2005). This integration was described by one female \nrespondent as the way \u201cfamilies where people are expressing their own \nviews stay unified and happy as no one is subject to the power of another\u201d. \nAlthough this appears rather idealistic, it is important to note that families \nare also the arenas where accommodations to individual needs are most \ncommonly resolved. This of course may not be fully evident to \u2018the public \nview\u2019 (Ewing, 1991).  \n \nCritical autonomy within dependence. Some of our data convey the \nimportance of education in encouraging wider reflection and moral \nreasoning (\u201c[less educated people] do not know which is good and which is \nbad\u201d). It may stimulate flexibility in traditional roles (\u201ceducation makes men \nsympathetic and helpful\u201d) and the development of wisdom. Implicitly it can \nalso help prevent uncritical acceptance of the messages transmitted by the \nmass media where \u201cthe serials [natoks] show such things like daughter-in-\nlaws and households living separately which influence young people today.\u201d  \n \nThe benefits of awareness and consciousness extend to the family, \nalthough it\u2019s possible that knowledge of how things work in Bangladeshi \nsociety may support traditional practices rather than challenge them \n(\u201cmembers of [uneducated] families create conflict among themselves \nbecause they are not conscious about their role in the family\u201d). This \nknowledge is most beneficial when coupled with an empathic awareness of \nothers so that \u201cmembers of an educated family can understand each other \nand avoid conflicts when they realize the facts of the situation.\u201d However, \neducation may be a resource that needs to be managed carefully as \u201con the \nother hand, an educated person can create all kinds of problems in his \nfamily; he can understand as well as compromise everything\u201d.  \n \nAssessing Domain Specific Autonomy \n \nImplicit in the argument thus far is a recognition that autonomy results from \nthe combined effect of internal and external factors. Recently Diener and \n  19 \n \nBiswas-Diener explored in more detail the interplay of both factors in \ndetermining subjective well-being (2004). In their discussion they introduced \nthe notion of empowerment and made a distinction between external and \ninternal forms of empowerment.  While external empowerment refers to \nexternal conditions (income, status, and collective power) that permit or \ninhibit effective action, internal empowerment refers mostly to personal traits \nand characteristics (competences, skills, and abilities). Perhaps not \nsurprisingly they make the argument that both external and internal \nempowerment are necessary for effective action, and that outcomes will \nreflect the complex interplay of external circumstances and people\u2019s skills \nand resources.12 Crucially however they suggested that the assessment of \noutcomes can only be made in reference to specific goals or circumstances. \nThis is germane to our discussion because it alerts us to the need to look at \nspecific contexts or domains separately to assess the scope for and practice \nof autonomous action in each. Again each case will require, as we have \nargued, close consideration of internal and external factors as well as an \nexamination of how both factors influence each other.  \n \nWhereas THN advocates overall measures of the absence of autonomy, \nnotably mental ill-health and poor socially-relevant competences, Alkire \nstrongly advocates a disaggregated approach (2002, 2005, 2006), although \nshe acknowledges the possibility of \u2018spill-over\u2019 effects between the domains \n(2006). In a disaggregated approach, a person\u2019s agency is assessed with \nrespect to different functionings or broader domains of life. Thus a woman \nmay be empowered as a citizen in the political sphere, but prevented by her \ngender or lack of education from getting a job, or be unable to make crucial \ndecisions in the household. The advantage of such an approach is that it \nallows for a stronger appreciation of the embedded nature of autonomous \naction, and offers fascinating insights into how people are both constrained \nby, and able to manipulate their social contexts. In short, it facilitates the \nmeasurement of situated autonomies. However, the risk of such approaches \n \n12 \nEwing (1991) explores the relationship between external and internal empowerment at the \nindividual level in an intriguing analysis of young Pakistani women that rests on a distinction \nbetween interpersonal and intrapsychic autonomy. She argues that the latter, akin to Diener \nand Biswas -Diener\u2019s internal empowerment, enables them to deal effectively with the \ncommon stresses encountered in their new in-laws\u2019 homes.  \n  20 \n \nis that they become so fixed on a specific set of domains that the \ninterconnectedness of domains across people\u2019s lives is lost.13  \n \nRahman and Rao (2002) provided a powerful example of an investigation \ninto domain specific autonomy. In their study of women\u2019s agency in north \nand south India, they considered kinship, labour markets, and public action \nto be the three most important domains, and developed indicators of \nautonomy within each. Thus, in the kinship domain they selected two key \nindicators: women\u2019s ability to move freely outside the home and their \nparticipation in household decision-making. In the labour market domain, \nthey focused on options for earning outside the home and control over the \nhousehold budget. Finally in the public action domain they found that the \npresence of public goods such as electricity, schools, and roads strongly \nenhanced women\u2019s autonomy.  \n \nAlsop and Heinsohn (2005) undertook a related study of women\u2019s \nempowerment, defined as: enhancing the capacity of individuals or groups \nto make choices and achieve desired actions and outcomes. To do this they \nadopted a rigorous methodology that gave strong insights into domain-\nspecific autonomous action. In their study they measured different degrees \nof empowerment by assessing: \n1. Whether a person has the opportunity to make a choice. So for \nexample if a woman wants to send her daughter to school, is there a \nschool for the daughter to go to? \n2. Whether a person actually uses the opportunity to choose. So if the \nanswer to (1) is yes, does the woman actually make the decision to \nsend her daughter to school? \n3. Whether, once the choice is made, it brings the desired outcome. So \nif the answer to (2) is yes, does the daughter actually attend school? \n \nThese aspects of empowerment were then operationalised within three \ndomains of people\u2019s lives \u2013 the state, the market, and society \u2013 and at three \ndifferent levels \u2013 macro, intermediary, and local. This yields a rich matrix of \nempowerment options, which may or may not be open to groups of women, \n \n13\n The assumption that people\u2019s lives can be divided into discrete and quantifiable domains \nmay be a reinscription of Cartesian dualism, as explored in Camfield and McGregor 2005 \n(see also Nilsson et al 2005 in a Bangladeshi context).  \n  21 \n \nand allows for an analysis into the interplay of external and internal \nconditions. For example, societal level indicators from Ethiopia are: women \nhaving an equal say over the spacing of children, or investment in \nhousehold durables. Commenting on this study, Alkire (2006) concluded \nthat the research enables us to make a crucial distinction between having \nthe capability to do something, and choosing whether or not to do it. \n \nA final study worth mentioning here is offered by Madhok (2005), in which \nshe moves the analytical lens away from actions per se to the thought \nprocesses through which people arrive at decisions to act or not act. This \ncomes very close to Doyal and Gough\u2019s idea of \u2018critical autonomy\u2019 entailing \nthe capacity of self-reflection. Madhok\u2019s work examines the various personal \nattempts of sathins (workers within the Women\u2019s Development Program in \nthe State of Rajasthan) to transform the dominant discourse of political \nrights. Her account details the creative ways in which women selectively \nabsorb and identify with rights discourses in an attempt to create a new and \nalternative moral framework that increases their participation and influence \nin the political sphere. Although Madhok\u2019s work illustrates the exercise of \nautonomy in a specific domain of life, her invitation to focus more on ideas \nthan actions advances our understanding of autonomy, especially in \nadverse environments. In adverse contexts, where freedoms are often \nconstrained, the exercise of autonomy may only be expressed cautiously in \npublic, if indeed at all. However, and this is crucial, a lack of public \nexpression (or action) does not mean that people do not exercise or value \nautonomy.  \n \nThis raises an important question regarding the whole issue of researching \nautonomy in conditions of subordination. Madhok takes as an example the \nindicator of small family sizes, which is typically used to indicate greater \nwomen\u2019s autonomy in relation to fertility. She argues that this indicator may \nbe inadequate in certain contexts because it fails crucially to tell us whether \nthe decision to have a small family actually belongs to the woman, her \nhusband, or some other external actor such as an extended family. In other \nwords the \u2018indicator\u2019 may not be indicating women\u2019s autonomy at all. This \nleads Madhok to propose that in order to make conclusive arguments about \nautonomy it is vital to determine women\u2019s ideal preferences rather than rely \nsolely on those expressed in action. By examining ideas and preferences, \nwe gain a fuller understanding of choices that are made and also the \n  22 \n \nreasons (social, political, economic and cultural) that determine whether \nchoices are then translated into action or not.  \n \nAt a more general level, we can conclude that there are cultures and \ncontexts where the public endorsement or enactment of autonomy may be \ndifficult or even impossible. However this does not mean that autonomy is \nless valued and this represents a fundamental challenge to those seeking to \ncarry out research into autonomy in contexts like Bangladesh where \npatterns of subordination and deference are more evident in everyday life.14  \n \nEvidence from Bangladesh \n \nThe majority of rural respondents identified four key domains that they \nconsidered important in a discussion of autonomy: (1) family (household \ndecision-making), (2) employment, (3) finances, and (4) community (ability \nto participate in community development). However older women were less \nambitious in identifying domains and emphasised much more the \nimportance of achieving autonomy in their finances (by having a small \nincome or some savings). Additionally, older men and women were \nconcerned with physical autonomy, while younger ones wanted access to \neducation and mobility. \n \nFemale respondents from the urban data set are also exercising autonomy, \nor trying to exercise it, in the domains of (1) family, and (2) employment, but \nthey added a third domain of education. For example, they cited control over \nthe timing of their marriage and choice of partner, and having control over a \nsum of money that they could use to fulfil their family\u2019s needs. Younger (but \nnot older) women wanted to be consulted by their husbands and for their \nhousehold to be physically autonomous.  \n \nOne issue for younger women was having control over a sum of money that \nthey could use within the context of their relationships, for example, to fulfil \nthe needs of their children, or provide support to their natal home. This did \nnot need to be a large amount, or even entirely their own, as the expressed \ngoal was not financial independence or having a good income, as was the \n \n14\n We are indebted to one of the reviewers for drawing our attention to the wider research \nimplications of Madhok\u2019s study.  \n  23 \n \ncase for young men.  Their sense of achievement was derived instead from \nsources like advising and assisting others, and maintaining their principles \n(\u201cI have led my life according to Islam. This gives me peace in my mind\u201d). \nThis illustrates the operation of autonomous values within dependent \nrelationships. \n \nEducation was a key personal resource for younger women and was \ndescribed as a \u201cwealth\u201d, which \u201cno one can take away\u201d (not having \neducation was like \u201chaving eyes and being blind\u201d). It was seen as \nstrengthening their capabilities (\u201cthey can perform their tasks well so they \nare an asset for their family\u201d), developing \u201ca cool mind to tackle problems\u201d, \nand giving them access to \u201coffice\u201d jobs, income, and respect (\u201ca girl who is \neducated is regarded differently\u201d). It also provided \u201csocial acceptance as an \nunmarried woman\u201d (removing the pressure to marry young), and a stronger \nposition with their in-laws when they did marry (\u201cif she were a graduate she \nwould not have to ask her husband for everything\u201d). These dimensions of \neducation were confirmed by a recent study in rural Bangladesh (Nargish, \n2004), which examined how it functioned to increase access to higher \npaying jobs, and improve marriage prospects, friendship, social status, and \nother valued outcomes. \n  \nCollective Action and Autonomy \n \nFinally we want to consider the link between collective action and autonomy. \nThis is particularly pertinent to the context of Bangladesh where there is a \nproliferation of community based organizations and non-governmental \norganizations working with the poor. Interestingly, the most positive \npresentation of ideas synonymous with autonomy is by development \norganizations. \u2018Independence\u2019 and \u2018self reliance\u2019 therefore are projected \nmuch more as goals of organizations than they are of individuals (Wilce, \n1998).  \n \nEarly development analyses in Bangladesh highlighted a key link between \nwhat was perceived as traditional patterns of relationships, based \nessentially on deference and subordination, and the reproduction of poverty. \nTypically but not exclusively, these relationships took the form of patron-\nclient networks \u2013 a system of organization where vertical relations across \nclass lines are forged between poorer clients and richer patrons. The \nrelationship between patron and client has been described as a moral or \n  24 \n \nbenevolent one (Devine, 1999; Maloney, 1988; McGregor, 1994) because it \ntriggers a series of expectations and obligations that determine the chances \nof entitlement demands ever being satisfied. For the poor, both survival and \nupward mobility depend on the ability to secure the sympathy of a reliable \npatron. This however was never guaranteed, and in most cases clients were \nobliged to demonstrate personal loyalty and allegiance. Subordination and \ncoercion were therefore written into the very fabric of patron-client relations, \nan inevitable outcome of what Wood (2003) has aptly termed the Faustian \nBargain.  \n \nAs a consequence of this analysis, the majority of early Non Governmental \nOrganizations (NGOs) adopted radical agendas that explicitly set out to free \nthe poor from their subordinate client status. Building on insights from Paolo \nFreire\u2019s pedagogy of liberation (Freire, 1972), these organizations adopted \nthe language of conscientisation, self-reliance, and solidarity to highlight \ntheir intention. They explicitly presented themselves as an alternative social \nforce that could help the poor redress power imbalances and take more \ncontrol over their lives. This process ultimately implied breaking free of \ndominating relationships and a reaffirmation of autonomy.  \n \nIn her analysis of the dynamics of development-orientated organizations, \nAlkire (2002, 2005) argues that the level and quality of participation are key \ndeterminants of whether or not outcomes will be beneficial for participants. \nShe identifies four aspects of participation that need to be considered (2002, \np. 129-143):  \n\u00b7 Intrinsic value, i.e., is participation deemed personally valuable by \nthe participant (something which facilitates agency achievement)  \n\u00b7 Transitive effects, i.e., does participation improve outcomes \n\u00b7 Constructive effects, i.e., does participation help shape values and \npriorities \n\u00b7 Intransitive effects, i.e., does participation fashion group identity. \n \nThese considerations are a useful reminder that not everything that falls \nunder the umbrella of participation works to the benefit of participants \n(White, 2000). To link the discussion of participation with our earlier \nexploration of autonomy, we can argue that participation in collective action \nforms may encourage behaviour that is more heteronomous (e.g. coercive \nor subordinating) or more autonomous. The difference between these \npositions requires detailed empirical investigation. Our view is that to be \n  25 \n \nautonomous, the type of agency to evolve from participation in organizations \nlike NGOs must be self-conscious and not simply a reflection of compliance \nwith inherited institutions, or habitus. In other words, it should entail some \nsense of critical autonomy. Also, such collective autonomy will typically seek \nto influence the institutions that affect people\u2019s lives. This too can be \nassessed within distinct domains and at different levels.15 \n \nEvidence from Bangladesh \n \nIn this instance, our evidence from Bangladesh relates to the experience of \na particular development organization called Shammo,16 which one of us \nhas observed over a number of years. Members of the organization are \npoor landless farmers who for many years have lived and worked under the \nauthority of local elite landlords in a patron-client relationship. As poorer \nclients, they were expected to offer loyalty to their respective patrons in the \nhope of receiving benefits or favours that would help them achieve a more \nsecure livelihood. The balance of power in the relationship is so biased \ntowards the patron that the ability of poorer clients to act collectively in their \nown interests is severely constrained. Thus in the area where Shammo was \nworking, the political power of the local elites was so strong that they were \nable to forcibly take control over huge amounts of agricultural land that the \nGovernment had allocated by decree to the landless farmers.17 Given that \nthe poor relied on the same patrons for their subsistence, there was very \nlittle reaction to the elites\u2019 strategy. However when Shammo began as an \norganization,  the land that had been illegally taken from the poor became \nan obvious focus point for mobilization.  \n \n \n15\n There are big issues about the relationship between collective autonomy and individual \nautonomy, which cannot be discussed here. However, we would claim that the weight of \nscientific findings and historical experience suggests that the success of challenges to \noppressive social orders is proportionate to the critical autonomy of the challengers. See for \nexample Barrington Moore\u2019s impressive study of injustice, based on class struggles in \nnineteenth century Germany (Barrington Moore 1978, especially chapter 3).  \n16 \u2018\nShammo\u2019 is a pseudonym for this development organization. For more details see Devine \n(1999). \n17 \nAgricultural land allocated to the poor in this way is known as khas land. In the area where \nShammo was working there was an area of over 800 acres of khas land that had been taken \nover by the elites.   \n  26 \n \nBeginning from a palpable sense of injustice and grievance, Shammo \nevolved gradually into a site where its members were able to nurture new \nforms of agency for themselves that often, but not always, translated into \naction. Three key elements facilitated the creation of this new form of \nagency for Shammo\u2019s members (Devine, 2004). First, the organization \nfacilitated the construction of a new form of shared identity that enabled \nmembers to shift their allegiance away from the domination of traditional \nelites and to act more as a collective unit. This is close to Alkire\u2019s notion of \nintransitive effects. For Shammo\u2019s members the new form of shared identity \nwas nurtured in a number of ways ranging from routine meetings and \ngeneral daily interaction to more public events such as processions and \nrallies. Second, the organization ensured the delivery of tangible \nimprovements to its members (what Alkire refers to as transitive effects), for \nexample, recovering ownership of the land that was theirs by right. However \nwith time the organization and its members also acquired positional \nadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis political and bureaucratic structures charged with \ndelivering key services and goods. As a result of this, members successfully \nmanaged to lobby for better and just wages, improved working conditions \nfor sharecroppers, and a more transparent distribution of government \nwelfare goods and services. Finally, the organization also fostered utopian \nspaces (de Certeau, 1984) in which the future aspirations of members and \nthe potential for further reconfigurations of power relations are nurtured \n(Appadurai, 2004). This is the area of life where people formulate their ideal \npreferences and judgments, and then decide if and how to enact these \n(Madhok, 2005) \u2013 Alkire\u2019s constructive effects.   \n \nThere is therefore a prima facie case for confirming that organizations like \nShammo can facilitate new forms of agency. However, it is important to look \nbeyond the outcomes and ask about the quality of agency that is nurtured. \nWhile Shammo has been pivotal to the task of establishing, protecting and \nthen advancing the rights of its poor members, Devine (2002) provides \nevidence that this has been underpinned by a logic of preferential \nbehaviour. For example, the entitlement rights of certain people (e.g. to \nland) were privileged while those of others were ignored. Thus, entitlement \nclaims were more likely to receive a positive response if the claimant was a \nmember of Shammo (as opposed to a non-member), and then if the \nclaimant was known to be publicly loyal to the organization\u2019s leaders. In \nother words, people who were closest to the leaders seemed to enjoy \nstronger entitlement claims. This leads us therefore to a rather nebulous \n  27 \n \narea where the boundaries between favours and rights are blurred. The \nresult of this is that among members as well as between members and staff \nof the organization, new forms of clientelist behaviour emerged as \nindividuals tried to get closer to and publicly demonstrate their loyalty to the \norganization\u2019s leaders. Fully aware of this, members continued to trust the \norganization because they ultimately judged it as caring, supportive, and \nrelevant to their everyday struggles. In other words, the organization helped \npeople move from a more heteronomous condition (under the old patrons) \nto a more autonomous one. Using this as an illustration, Devine makes the \nmore general argument that in contexts like Bangladesh, the right kind of \ndependency relationship can be an important and creative vehicle within \nwhich the poor can effectively exercise greater agency and autonomy.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe fact that autonomy is firmly rooted in Western intellectual traditions has \nled some to question its coherence and suitability for understanding well-\nbeing in developing countries. Using qualitative data from people\u2019s \nevaluation of the quality of their lives in Bangladesh, this article has shown \nthat the concept of autonomy is a useful one in that it captures people\u2019s \ngoals and attempts to change things in a way they consider important for \ntheir overall well-being. More technically, the concept of autonomy gives \nimportant insights into the construction and experience of people\u2019s \ncapacities as agents. Our data supports three key arguments. First, people \nfrom rural and urban Bangladesh express what could be characterised as a \nneed for autonomy in both explicit and implicit terms. Second, the pursuit of \nautonomy is iterative and cumulative in that people tend to focus on \nparticular domains in their lives where they wish to increase their ability to \nexercise agency. Moreover, different people prioritize different domains and \nwe can tentatively assume that these choices change over time. Finally, \nexperiences of autonomy occur primarily within and through people\u2019s \ninterpersonal relationships. While family and kin networks seem to be \ncentral, in some cases formal organizations such as community-based or \ndevelopment organizations can also play a crucial role. \n \nOur choice to use data from Bangladesh was a deliberate one. First, it is \none of the poorest countries in the world where conditions of subordination \nand adversity are ubiquitous. While people in Bangladesh may experience \nnumerous \u2018lacks of freedoms\u2019 in their lives, this does not mean, our data \n  28 \n \nsuggests, that they are necessarily weak in autonomy. Second, Bangladesh \nis often characterised as a society in which people express their \npersonhood in more relational as opposed to individualist forms.18 Our data \nshows that this is not incompatible with the pursuit of autonomy and indeed \nit may be a medium through which autonomy is more effectively achieved. \nAutonomy can be directed toward either social or personal goals or both, \nand can be enacted individually, or by participation in groups, or both.   \n \nThe analysis reported here ultimately presents a complex array of situated \nautonomies that embrace a wide range of covert as well as overt behaviour \npatterns, decisions, and actions. Rather than locate this as an argument in \nfavour of cultural relativism, we would argue that it underlines the recursive \nnature of human life. In other words, autonomy is determined not only by the \nagential capacities of an individual but also by the nature of relationships he \nor she may enjoy with others. Two implications flow from this. First of all, it \nis imperative that we focus more research on how people in specific \ncontexts negotiate and organize to achieve more autonomy in their lives. \nThe distinction between individualist and collectivist contexts has thrown up \nimportant insights. But it can be distracting as even in more collectivist \nsocieties like Bangladesh there are important differences in the way people \nattempt to achieve autonomy and how they evaluate this. Similarly, people \ncan achieve high levels of autonomy in particular domains (including the \ncognitive or intrapsychic domain) but may fail to transfer or express these in \nother domains. One can expect to find therefore considerable subtlety, \nambiguity, and even contradiction, in the strategies people deploy to \nachieve greater autonomy.  \n \nThis leads directly to the second reflection that is more conceptual in nature. \nTo understand the full significance of situated autonomies, we would argue \nthat it is important to introduce a stronger theory of power to our analysis. \nActions, preferences and values are never created ex nihilo (Lukes, 1974) \nand therefore it is incumbent to reflect on the formation of values, and the \nprocesses by which people decide to express preferred choices in action or \n \n18\n The way personhood is expressed in Bangladesh is obviously dynamic. For example, the \nurbanization of rural life, the gradual nuclearization of household structures, and increased \neducation are but three processes that may in time have an immediate impact on the way \npeople see themselves. \n  29 \n \ninaction. This, we would contend, will take us towards a richer appreciation \nof the social and cultural construction of autonomy.  \n \nBut none of this disputes the centrality of autonomy to a eudaimonic \nconception of well-being. Its widespread presence in normative theories of \nthe good life, theories of common human needs and eudaimonic \napproaches in psychology has received empirical support in our initial \nqualitative research in Bangladesh. That it has resonance in such a \nmaterially impoverished yet relationally dense milieu adds support to its \nuniversality. It illustrates that there are aspects of well-being beyond \nhedonic satisfaction, and that our understanding of eudaimonic well-being is \nenhanced by using an appropriate and situated notion of autonomy. \n  30 \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAlkire, S.
