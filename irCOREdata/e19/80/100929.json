For polynomials f on the complex plane with a dendrite Julia set we study\ninvariant probability measures, obtained from a reference measure. To do this we follow\nKeller [K1] in constructing canonical Markov extensions. We discuss \u2018liftability\u2019 of\nmeasures (both f -invariant and non-invariant) to the Markov extension, showing that\ninvariant measures are liftable if and only if they have a positive Lyapunov exponent.\nWe also show that \u03b4-conformal measure is liftable if and only if the set of points with\npositive Lyapunov exponent has positive measure.\n1. Introduction\nErgodic properties for polynomial or rational maps have been looked at for various\nmeasures and various types of Julia sets. One can consider the measures of maximal\nentropy, e.g. [FLM, Zd], or more generally, equilibrium states of certain Ho\u00a8lder potentials,\nsee e.g. [Ly, DPU, Ha]. This approach is particularly natural when the map is hyperbolic\nand the potential is \u2212t log |Df |, where t is the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia set: then\nthe equilibrium state is equivalent to conformal measure (as obtained by Sullivan, see [Su]).\nWhen the Julia set is parabolic, invariant measures equivalent to conformal measure are\nfound in [DU, U1, U2]. In the case where there are recurrent critical points in the Julia\nset, the papers [GS, Pr, Re] focus on invariant probability measures that are absolutely\ncontinuous with respect to conformal measures, using assumptions on the derivatives on\nthe critical orbits. See [PU, U3] for surveys. The theory has not yet developed to the same\nextent as, for example, interval maps, where the availability of induced maps and tower\nconstructions (cf. [Y1, Y2]) allowed the investigation of several stochastic properties,\nincluding the rate of mixing and central limit theorem [Y2, BLS], return time statistics and\nrelated properties [BSTV, BV, Co] and invariance principles, see e.g. [MN]. However,\nduring the preparation of this paper, we learned that some good results in this direction\nhave been proved for rational maps satisfying the \u2018topological Collet\u2013Eckmann\u2019 condition\nin [PrRL].\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n744 H. Bruin and M. Todd\nIn the 1980s, Hofbauer and Keller constructed so-called canonical Markov extensions\nfor piecewise monotone maps of the interval [Ho, HK, K1], which they used to study the\ntopological and measure theoretical behaviour of these maps. These Markov extensions\nwere considered in an abstract setting in [K1, Bu], where one of the aims was to extend the\ntheory to higher dimensions. Indeed in [Bu] some higher dimensional examples are given.\nThat paper focuses on the probability measures given by the symbolic dynamics obtained\nfrom the tower structure, an approach also used in [Ne, BuS]. In [BuK] results on transfer\noperators are proved in this higher dimensional setting and in [BuPS] conformal measures\nare found.\nOur approach follows the papers of Keller [K1, K2]. In the first of these papers,\nresults are proved about the liftability of probability measures on the original system to\nthe associated Markov extension. In particular, the liftability of ergodic invariant measures\nwith positive entropy is shown. While the abstract theory given there applies, in principle,\nin any dimension, the applications given are to interval maps. In the second paper it is\nshown that, given a smooth interval map, positive pointwise Lyapunov exponents implies\nthe liftability of Lebesgue measure. The purpose of this paper is to extend those results\nto maps on the complex plane. We construct Markov extensions (J\u02c6 , f\u02c6 ) for complex\npolynomials f and study the liftability properties of probability measures supported on\nthe Julia set J . (This allows us to deal with some cases where critical points lie in J .)\nGiven a probability measure \u00b5 on J , we construct a sequence of Cesaro means {\u00b5\u02c6n}n\non J\u02c6 , and we say that \u00b5 is liftable to the Markov extension if this sequence has a non-zero\nvague limit measure \u00b5\u02c6. The limit measure \u00b5\u02c6 is f\u02c6 -invariant, even if the measure \u00b5 is not\nf -invariant. This technique is particularly useful for finding invariant probability measures\nthat are absolutely continuous with respect to \u03b4-conformal measure on the Julia set.\nAmong other things, we prove that an ergodic invariant probability measure \u00b5 is\nliftable if and only if its Lyapunov exponent is positive (cf. [BK]). Furthermore, for\nliftable measures, typical points are conical (i.e. go to large scale, see Lemma 9) with\npositive frequency. Similar results hold for (non-invariant) \u03b4-conformal measure \u00b5\u03b4 .\n(The measure \u00b5\u03b4 is \u03b4-conformal on J if \u00b5\u03b4(J ) = 1 and \u00b5(f (A)) =\n\u222b\nA |Df |\u03b4 d\u00b5\u03b4\nfor all measurable sets A such that f : A \u2192 f (A) is one-to-one.) We prove that the\npointwise lower Lyapunov exponent \u03bb(z) is strictly greater than 0 for a set of positive\n\u00b5\u03b4-measure if and only if \u00b5\u03b4 is liftable, and in this case there is an f -invariant probability\nmeasure equivalent to \u00b5\u03b4 . We note that this result applies to polynomials considered in\n[GS, Pr, Re], when the Julia sets of these polynomials are dendrites; see below.\nWhen proving our results on the relation between liftability and positive Lyapunov\nexponents, we use the Koebe lemma: a one-dimensional tool. Work in progress aims\nat extending these results to higher dimensions. Our result on finding invariant probability\nmeasure absolutely continuous with respect to \u03b4-conformal measure again uses the Koebe\nlemma and seems a more difficult type of result to generalize.\nMarkov extensions (popularly called Hofbauer towers) are less well known than\nthe Young towers [Y1, Y2]. We wish to highlight the difference between these two\nconstructions. In short, for the Young tower case, given an invariant measure \u00b5 and a\nsubset Y of the phase space, a partition Y = \u22c3j Yj (mod \u00b5) is constructed together\nwith return times Rj such that F : \u22c3j Yj \u2192 Y , F |Yj = f Rj |Yj and f Rj : Yj \u2192 Y\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nMarkov extensions and measures for complex polynomials 745\nis one-to-one and has good distortion and expansion properties. These are then used to\nstudy stochastic limit properties (e.g. mixing rates, the central limit theorem, invariance\nprinciples) of specific invariant measures. The construction is therefore linked to the choice\nof the measure, and may be quite involved in practical applications. The construction of the\nHofbauer tower, on the other hand, is combinatorial and can be used to study all probability\nmeasures. In fact, it is exactly for the liftable invariant probability measures that Young\ntowers can be constructed, in a canonical way, as first return maps to appropriate sets in\nthe Markov extension; see [Br].\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. The construction of the canonical Markov\nextension occupies \u00a72. We restrict our attention to polynomials f with locally connected\nfull Julia sets (dendrites), as we need to find a finite partition P1 of the Julia set J such\nthat f is univalent on each partition element. Such partitions may exist for the Julia set\nof many other rational maps as well, but is hard to give for rational maps in all generality.\nIn \u00a73 we describe the lifting procedure of measures. As remarked there, in contrast to\nsubsequent sections, \u00a73 is largely independent of the geometry of J , and can be easily\nextended to Markov extensions in other settings. In \u00a74 we introduce inducing constructions\nas a tool to prove that, for liftable measures, typical points will \u2018go to large scale\u2019 with\npositive frequency. Section 5 focuses on (ergodic) invariant probability measures \u00b5 and\ntheir Lyapunov exponents \u03bb(\u00b5). It is shown that \u00b5 is liftable if and only if \u03bb(\u00b5) > 0.\nSection 6 gives a similar result for \u03b4-conformal measure \u00b5\u03b4 . It shows that \u00b5\u03b4 is liftable if\nand only if the pointwise lower Lyapunov exponent \u03bb(z) > 0 for all z in a set of positive\n\u00b5\u03b4-measure.\n2. The Markov extension\nLet f : C \u2192 C be a polynomial of degree d with a connected, locally connected and full\nJulia set J (i.e. C \\ J is connected). Consequently all critical points belong to J . Let Cr\ndenote the critical set. It is easy to see that J is a dendrite, defined as follows (cf. [Ku]).\nDefinition. A metric space (X, d) is called a dendrite if it is connected, locally connected,\nand for any two points x, y \u2208 X there is a unique arc \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 X connecting x to y.\nThe Fatou set F coincides with the basin of \u221e. Let the Green function G : F \u2192 R be\ndefined by G(z) = limn\u2192\u221e log |f n(z)|\/dn; see [Mi] for more details. The equipotentials\n(i.e. level sets) of the Green function form a foliation of F consisting of nested Jordan\ncurves. The orthogonal foliation is the foliation of external rays. Each external ray is a\ncopy of R embedded in F , and if \u03b3 : R \u2192 R is such an embedding such that |\u03b3 (t)|\nis large for large t , then limt\u2192\u221e arg \u03b3 (t) is a well-defined number \u03d1 \u2208 S1, called the\nexternal angle of R. Let R\u03d1 denote the ray with external angle \u03d1 , and \u03b3\u03d1 : R \u2192 R\u03d1 its\nparameterization. It is convenient to parameterize external rays by the values of the Green\nfunction: G(\u03b3\u03d1(t)) = t for each \u03d1 \u2208 S1 and t \u2208 R. Note that f (R\u03d1) = Rd\u03d1 mod 1; more\nprecisely: f (\u03b3\u03d1(t)) = \u03b3d\u03d1 mod 1(t + 1).\nLEMMA 1. There is a finite partition P1 of J \\ Cr such that f |Z is univalent for each\nZ \u2208 P1.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n746 H. Bruin and M. Todd\nProof. Because J is locally connected, each external ray R\u03d1 lands at a single point in\nz \u2208 J and each z \u2208 J is the landing point of at least one external ray. For each c \u2208 Cr ,\nselect \u03bac \u0001 1 rays that land at f (c) (note that Theorems 1.1 and 3.1 of [Ki] imply that there\ncan be at most 2d rays landing here). If c has degree dc, there are \u03bacdc \u0001 2 preimage rays\nlanding at c. The union of these rays, together with cj , is a locally compact set, separating\nthe plane and also J into \u03bacdc \u2018segments\u2019. As J is closed, the closure of the segments of\nJ \\ {c} intersect only at c. Repeating the argument for all other critical points gives the\nassertion. \u0001\nLet P0 = {J } be the trivial partition of J , and P1 be the partition of Lemma 1.\nLet Pn = \u2228n\u22121i=0 f\u2212i (P1), and for z \/\u2208 \u22c3n\u22121i=0 f\u2212i (Cr) let Zn[z] be the element of Pn\ncontaining z. Note that each Zn \u2208 Pn is connected (in fact, Zn is a dendrite) and f n|Zn is\nunivalent. We call Zn an n-cylinder.\nDefinition. The canonical Markov extension J\u02c6 is a disjoint union of copies D of subsets\nof J , subject to an identification discussed below. We call sets D domains and denote\ntheir collection as by D. Let \u03c0 : J\u02c6 \u2192 J be the inclusion map. Domains D are defined\nrecursively as follows.\n\u2022 The first domain J\u02c60, called the base of the Markov extension, is a copy of J .\n\u2022 Given a domain D \u2208 D and a non-empty set of the form f (\u03c0(D) \u2229 Z) for some\nZ \u2208 P1, we let D\u2032 be a copy of f (\u03c0(D) \u2229 Z) and add it to D. Write D \u2192 D\u2032 in this\ncase.\n\u2022 The collection D is such that J\u02c60 \u2208 D, and D is closed under the previous operation.\nEach z\u02c6 \u2208 D can be represented by a pair (z,D) where z\u02c6 \u2208 D and \u03c0(z\u02c6) = z. Moreover,\nany pair (z,D) defines a unique z\u02c6 \u2208 J whenever z \u2208 \u03c0(D). This allows us to define\nf\u02c6 : J\u02c6 \u2192 J\u02c6 .\n\u2022 If z\u02c6 \u2208 D, D \u2192 D\u2032 and \u03c0(z\u02c6) belongs to the closure of Z \u2208 P1 such that\n\u03c0(D\u2032) = f (\u03c0(D) \u2229 Z), then we let f\u02c6 (z\u02c6) = (f (z),D\u2032). Clearly\n\u03c0 \u25e6 f\u02c6 = f \u25e6 \u03c0.\n\u2022 If \u03c0(z\u02c6) \u2208 Cr , then f\u02c6 can be multi-valued at z\u02c6, but a domain D \u2208 D contains at most\none of the images of z\u02c6. In all other cases, f\u02c6 (z\u02c6) is a single point, belonging to a single\ndomain D.\nThe next step is to define the cutpoints, their ages and origins, as well as the level of\ndomains.\n\u2022 The base J\u02c60 contains no cutpoints.\n\u2022 If z\u02c6 \u2208 D is a cutpoint or \u03c0(z\u02c6) \u2208 Cr , then each image f\u02c6 (z\u02c6) is a cutpoint. Its age is{\n1 if \u03c0(z\u02c6) \u2208 Cr and z\u02c6 is not a cutpoint;\na + 1 if z\u02c6 is a cutpoint of age a.\nThe set of cutpoints is denoted by Cut .\n\u2022 An a-cutpoint will be a cutpoint of age a. Each a-cutpoint z\u02c6 satisfies z\u02c6 = (f a(c),D)\nfor some D \u2208 D and c \u2208 Cr . This critical point c is called the origin of z\u02c6.\n\u2022 Given a domain D, level(D) is 0 if there are no cutpoints in D, and is the maximal\nage of the cutpoints in D otherwise. Let J\u02c6R be the union of all domains of\nlevel(D) \u0002 R.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nMarkov extensions and measures for complex polynomials 747\nThe final step is the identification of domains wherever possible.\n\u2022 Any two domainsD and D\u2032 such that \u03c0(D) = \u03c0(D\u2032), \u03c0(D\u2229Cut) = \u03c0(D\u2032\u2229Cut) and\nwhose cutpoints have the same ages and origins are identified. The canonical Markov\nextension is the disjoint union of the domains, factorized over the identification\ndescribed above.\nThe arrow relations D \u2192 D\u2032 give the Markov extension the structure of an (infinite)\ndirected graph. This is the Markov graph, since by construction (J\u02c6 , f\u02c6 ) is Markov with\nrespect to the partition of the domains of J\u02c6 .\nFor counting arguments later (see Lemma 2 and Appendix A), we must be aware of the\npossibility of \u2018moving sideways\u2019 in the Markov graph. That is, it is possible that for some\ndomain D of J\u02c6 there is an arrow D \u2192 D\u2032 where level(D) = level(D\u2032). This occurs if D\nis a domain of level n containing one cutpoint z\u02c6 of age n and a cutpoint z\u02c6\u2032 of age n \u2212 1.\nIf the arc in D connecting these two cutpoints intersects \u03c0\u22121(Cr) (recall that since J is\na dendrite, for any z, z\u2032 \u2208 J there exists a unique arc in J connecting z to z\u2032), then the\ndomain D\u2032 containing f\u02c6 (z\u02c6) will also have level n. So if D \u2192 D\u2032, then level(D\u2032) can take\nany value \u0002 level(D) + 1.\nDefine P\u02c61 to be the partition given by D \u2228 \u03c0\u22121P1. Let P\u02c6n := \u2228n\u22121i=0 f\u02c6\u2212i (P1) and\nP\u02c6Rn := P\u02c6n \u2229 J\u02c6R .\nRemark 1. The partition in Lemma 1, and hence the construction of the Markov extension,\nis not unique, because we have freedom in choosing the number of the rays \u03bac for each\ncritical value. However, any choice makes a valid partition. To illustrate this, assume that\nf (z) = z2 + c for c \u2208 (\u22122,\u2212 14 ) such that 0 \u2208 J . One is inclined to choose two (complex\nconjugate) rays landing at c = f (0); see Figure 1 (left). This will lead to a canonical\nMarkov extension which is very similar to the standard Markov extension constructed for\ninterval maps. More precisely, select the domains D \u2208 D such that \u03c0(D) \u2229 R \t= \u2205 and\nsuch that if \u03c0(D) = f n(Zn), then for each x \u2208 \u03c0(D) \u2229 R, there is x0 \u2208 Zn \u2229 R such that\nx = f n(x0). For each such D, retain D \u2229 \u03c0\u22121(R), and discard the rest of D as well as\nall other domains. Then this set with remaining graph structure is exactly the real Markov\nextension see Figure 1 (left, bold lines).\nChoosing only one ray is possible as well; in this case, each domain in the Markov\nextension will be a copy of the whole Julia set, see Figure 1 (right), and they will\nbe distinguished only by the fact that they have different (numbers of) cutpoints, and\nconsequently different canonical neighbourhoods, see below.\nWe summarize some properties of J\u02c6 in the following lemma.\nLEMMA 2.\n(a) For any a \u0001 1, each D \u2208 D contains at most #Cr cutpoints of age a (and at most\none for each different origin c).\n(b) Let D and D\u2032 be domains in J\u02c6 of the same level, sharing a cutpoint of maximal\nage, i.e. p\u02c6 \u2208 D and p\u02c6\u2032 \u2208 D are cutpoints of age a = level(D) = level(D\u2032)\nand \u03c0(p\u02c6) = \u03c0(p\u02c6\u2032). Suppose also that p\u02c6 and p\u02c6\u2032 have the same origin. Then \u03c0(D) =\n\u03c0(D\u2032) or \u03c0(D) \u2229 \u03c0(D\u2032) = \u03c0(p\u02c6).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n748 H. Bruin and M.

Schematic picture of some domains of the Markov extension of a quadratic map z \u000b\u2192 z2 + c using\n(left) two external rays R\u03d5 and R\u2032\u03d5 for \u03d5\u2032 = 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03d5, landing at c\u02c6 and (right) one external ray R\u03d5 . The pictures\non the bottom line are J\u02c60 and the rays landing at 0 defining the partition are shown. The point \u03c0(\u03b2) > 0 is fixed\nunder f , and \u03c0(\u2212\u03b2) is its other preimage. The middle line gives domains of level 1 and the top line domains\nof level 2. Cutpoints are denoted by a filled circle. Arrows indicate the edges D \u2192 D\u2032 of the Markov graph.\nFor clarity of the picture, if Z and Z\u2032 \u2208 P1 are symmetric to each other, the arrow from only one of them is\nshown. The bold lines on the left pictures indicate the \u2018real Markov extension\u2019.\n(c) The number of domains of level l is bounded by #Cr\u220fc \u03bac. Consequently, the\nnumber of domains in J\u02c6R is at most 1 + R#Cr\u220fc \u03bac.\nNotice that (b) implies that within a given level we can only \u2018move sideways\u2019 a\nuniformly bounded number of times.\nProof. For the proof of (a), note that if p\u02c6 \u2208 Cut \u2229D has age a, then \u03c0(p\u02c6) \u2208 f a(Cr). As J\u02c6\ncontains no loops, only one such point exists for each c and a. So there are at most #Cr\ncutpoints of age a.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nMarkov extensions and measures for complex polynomials 749\nTo prove (b), let D and D\u2032 be as in the statement, and assume that \u03c0(p\u02c6) = \u03c0(p\u02c6\u2032) =: p =\nf a(c), where a is the age of p and p\u02c6 and c their common origin. This means that there are\ndendrites E and E\u2032 intersecting at f (c) such that \u03c0(D) = f a\u22121(E), \u03c0(D) = f a\u22121(E\u2032),\nand f a\u22121|E and f a\u22121|E\u2032 are homeomorphic.\nAssume first that E and E\u2032 have at least an arc in common. If E \t= E\u2032, say x \u2208 E \\ E\u2032,\nthen there is y such that [x, f (c)] \u2229E\u2032 = [y, f (c)]. Here [a, b] indicates the unique arc in\nE connecting a and b. By construction, each set J \\ \u03c0(D\u2032)\u2229\u03c0(D\u2032) consists of postcritical\npoints, and the same holds for \u03c0(D) \\ \u03c0(D\u2032)\u2229 \u03c0(D\u2032). Since f a\u22121(E\u2032) = \u03c0(D\u2032), we have\nf n(y) \u2229 Cr \t= \u2205 for some n \u2208 Z. There are two possibilities:\n\u2022 the first is that y \u2208 \u22c3n\u00012 f n(Cr), but then D\u2032 must have a cutpoint of age > a,\ncontradicting maximality of a;\n\u2022 the second possibility y \u2208 \u22c3n\u00021 f n(Cr). In this case there is c\u02dc \u2208 Cr and 0 \u0002 s < a\nsuch that f s\u22121(y) \f c\u02dc. Take y such that s is maximal with this property. Now f s(E)\nand f s(E\u2032) belong to the same sector defined by the \u03bac\u02dc external rays landing at f (c\u02dc).\nBut then f s(E) and f s(E\u2032) both contain f s(x), a contradiction. Consequently,\n\u03c0(D) = \u03c0(D\u2032).\nOtherwise, E and E\u2032 intersect only at f (c). First assume that orb(c) contains no further\ncritical points. Then f a\u22121 is locally univalent at f (c). Thus if E \u2229 E\u2032 = f (c), then\n(as J is a dendrite, containing no loops) f a\u22121(E) \u2229 f a\u22121(E) = p. The final case is that\nthere is s and c\u02dc \u2208 Cr such that f s\u22121(p) = c\u02dc and f s(E) \u2229 f s(E\u2032) contains more than just\nf s(p) = f (c\u02dc). Then the previous argument shows that f s(E) = f s(E\u2032), and we again\nobtain \u03c0(D) = \u03c0(D\u2032).\nNow to prove (c), note that for each c \u2208 Cr and domain D, \u03c0\u22121(c) \u2229 D has at most\n\u03bac images under f\u02c6 . Under further iteration of f\u02c6 , this number does not increase, unless\nf s(c) = c\u02dc for some c\u02dc \u2208 Cr, in which case the number of images can multiply by at\nmost \u03bac\u02dc. The worst case is that there are\n\u220f\nc \u03bac images. In other words, for each l, there\ncan be at most\n\u220f\nc \u03bac domains D of level l for which \u03c0(D) pairwise intersect only at f l(c).\nUsing (b), this gives at most #Cr\u220fc \u03bac domains of level l altogether. \u0001\nLEMMA 3. Given z\u02c6, z\u02c6\u2032 \u2208 \u03c0\u22121(z), one of the following three cases occurs:\n(a) there exists n such that f\u02c6 n(z\u02c6) = f\u02c6 n(z\u02c6\u2032);\n(b) \u22c2n Zn[z] has positive diameter;\n(c) z \u2208\u22c3c\u2208Cr \u22c3n\u2208Z f n(c).\nIn the latter two cases at least one of z\u02c6, z\u02c6\u2032 visits any J\u02c6R only finitely often.\nProof. Assume that z is not precritical, and that neither z\u02c6 nor z\u02c6\u2032 is a cutpoint. Let D and\nD\u2032 be such that z\u02c6 \u2208 D and z\u02c6\u2032 \u2208 D\u2032. If there is n such that the cylinder Zn[z] is contained\nin \u03c0(D) as well as in \u03c0(D\u2032), then f\u02c6 n(D \u2229 \u03c0\u22121(Zn[z])) = f\u02c6 n(D\u2032 \u2229 \u03c0\u22121(Zn[z])), and\nf\u02c6 n(z\u02c6) = f\u02c6 n(z\u02c6\u2032) as in case (a).\nIf on the other hand there is no such n, then Z := \u22c2m Zm[z] has positive diameter as\nin case (b). Furthermore, Z contains no critical point in its interior (here we mean interior\nwith respect to the relative topology on J ), and if \u03c0(D) \t\u2283 Z, then Z\u02c6 := D \u2229 \u03c0\u22121Z\ncontains a cutpoint of D. Let p be such a cutpoint of maximal age, say a. Then f\u02c6 k(Z\u02c6) \f\nf\u02c6 k(p) which has age a + k. It follows that all the sets f\u02c6 k(Z\u02c6), k \u0001 0, are disjoint. As a\nresult Z\u02c6 can remain in J\u02c6R for at most R iterates.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n750 H. Bruin and M. Todd\nIf z\u02c6 (or z\u02c6\u2032) is a cutpoint of age a then we are in case (c) and the age of z\u02c6 will increase\nunder iteration of f\u02c6 . So for any R, f\u02c6 R+k(z\u02c6) is outside JR for any k \u0001 1.\nFinally, if z is precritical, then we are in case (c) again. It is possible that z belongs to\nthe common boundary of several cylinder sets Zn, and f\u02c6 n+1 is multi-valued at z\u02c6 and z\u02c6\u2032.\nBut each image f\u02c6 n+1(z\u02c6) and f\u02c6 n+1(z\u02c6\u2032) is a cutpoint of its level, so it will eventually climb\nin the Markov extension. \u0001\nRunning assumptions. We will repeatedly invoke the following assumptions on\nmeasures \u00b5, to almost surely rule out cases (b) and (c) of Lemma 3, as explained in the\nnext section. Typical cylinders should shrink,\ndiamZn[z] \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e for \u00b5-a.e. z \u2208 J , (SC)\nand the mass on the precritical points is 0,\n\u00b5\n(\u22c3\nn\u00020\nf n(Cr)\n)\n= 0. (Cr0)\nBy Theorem 3.2 of [BL], (SC) automatically follows from our assumption that f is a\npolynomial andJ is locally connected and full. However, as we believe Markov extensions\ncan be of use also when J is not locally connected (in which case one should think of a\ndifferent partition P1 than the one based on external rays landing at Cr), we will refer to\nthis property whenever we use it.\nCanonical neighbourhoods. Let UJ\u02c60 be a copy of the neighbourhood UJ of J bounded\nby the equipotential {G(z) = 0}. This is the canonical neighbourhood of J\u02c60. We will\ndefine a canonical neighbourhood UD for each D \u2208 D; they are copies of subsets of C.\nThe inclusion map \u03c0 is extended to UD in the natural way. In the proof of Lemma 1 we\nchose \u03bac external rays landing at the critical value f (c). The preimage rays landing at\ncritical points (together with Cr) divide \u03c0(UJ\u02c60) into #P1 regions. The closure of each\nsuch region O contains exactly one element of P1: if Z \u2208 P1, let OZ be the corresponding\nregion. For each D = f (Z), Z \u2208 P1, let UD be a copy of f (OZ) \u2229 UJ . This set is\nbounded by external rays landing at critical values and by the equipotential {G(z) = 0}.\nWe call UD the canonical neighbourhood of D, although it is not a neighbourhood in the\nstrict sense: D \\ UD consists of the cutpoints of D.\nWe continue recursively. If D \u2192 D\u2032 and UD is the canonical neighbourhood of D, then\nUD\u2032 is a copy of f (\u03c0(UD)\u2229OZ)\u2229UJ , where Z \u2208 P1 is such that \u03c0(D\u2032) = f (\u03c0(D) \u2229 Z).\nIt is bounded by external rays landing at cutpoints in D\u2032 and by {G(z) = 0}.\nLet U\u02c6 be the disjoint union of all canonical neighbourhoods. Then f\u02c6 naturally extends\nunivalently to U\u02c6 by\nf\u02c6 (z, UD) = (f (z), UD\u2032)\nif z \u2208 \u03c0(UD) \u2229 OZ where Z is such that \u03c0(D\u2032) = f (Z \u2229 D).\nLEMMA 4. The recursive definition of UD is independent of the path J\u02c60 \u2192 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2192 D by\nwhich D is reached.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nMarkov extensions and measures for complex polynomials 751\nProof. Since no path leads into J\u02c60, its canonical neighbourhood is uniquely defined.\nNow take D \u2208 D, D \t= J\u02c60 with at least two arrows leading to D. (To prove the lemma,\nwe can restrict to domains D with two arrows rather than two paths leading to it, because\nwhen two paths eventually merge, it suffices to study those domains at which these paths\nmerge.) For any cutpoint z\u02c6 of age a and origin c \u2208 Cr , we can find OZ with boundary\npoint c such that \u03c0(UD)\u2229B\u03b5(\u03c0(z\u02c6)) intersects f a(OZ\u2229B\u03b5(c)) for any \u03b5 > 0. Furthermore,\nthere are rays R\u03d5 and R\u03d5\u2032 (or possibly only one ray) landing at c and intersecting \u2202OZ such\nthat f a(R\u03d5) and f a(R\u2032\u03d5) land at \u03c0(z\u02c6) and intersect \u2202\u03c0(UD).\nThere are distinct arrows leading to D only if there is D\u2032 \u2208 D which is identified with D.\nBut D and D\u2032 are only identified if \u03c0(D) = \u03c0(D\u2032), and the cutpoints, their origins and\nages coincide. Therefore the boundaries of \u03c0(UD) and \u03c0(UD\u2032) comprise the same external\nrays together with {G(z) = 0}. It follows that \u03c0(UD) = \u03c0(UD\u2032), proving the lemma. \u0001\nLEMMA 5. The system (U\u02c6 , f\u02c6 ) is Markov with respect to the partition of canonical\nneighbourhoods, in the sense that, if f\u02c6 (UD) \u2229 UD\u2032 \t= \u2205, then f\u02c6 (UD) \u2283 UD\u2032 .\nProof. This is a direct consequence of the previous proof. \u0001\n3. Lifting measures\nIn the previous section we introduced the Markov extensions and canonical\nneighbourhoods for complex polynomials. In this section we will discuss the \u2018liftability\u2019\nproperties of measures to the Markov extension in the sense of Keller. Our assumptions\nare (SC) and (Cr0). We explain how they replace conditions (2.2) and (2.3) of [K1].\nThis section gives the abstract theory which is applicable to more general settings with\nthis type of Markov extension. In subsequent sections the precise geometry of J , and thus\nthe domains of J\u02c6 , play an important role again.\nGiven a Borel \u03c3 -algebra B on J and a Borel probability measure \u00b5 on J , we will\ndynamically lift this measure to a Borel probability measure \u00b5\u02c6 on J\u02c6 . Our approach follows\nthat of [K1]. We define a method of obtaining \u00b5\u02c6 and then show that it is f\u02c6 -invariant and\n\u00b5\u02c6 \u25e6 \u03c0\u22121 \u000e \u00b5.\nWe first introduce some notation. For some space X, we let C0(X) denote the set\nof continuous functions \u03d5 : X \u2192 R with compact support. For a set A \u2282 X, let\n\u03c7A : X \u2192 {0, 1} be the characteristic function of A.\nLet i be the trivial bijection mapping J to J\u02c60 (note that i\u22121 = \u03c0 |J\u02c60). Let\n\u00b5\u02c60 \u25e6 i = \u00b5 and \u00b5\u02c6n = 1\nn\nn\u22121\u2211\nk=0\n\u00b5\u02c60 \u25e6 f\u02c6\u2212k. (1)\nWe will find some \u00b5\u02c6 to be a limit of a subsequence of these measures. Note that J\u02c6\nis in general not compact, so the sequence {\u00b5\u02c6n}n may not have a subsequence with limit\nin the weak topology. Instead we use the vague topology; see for example [Bi]. Given a\ntopological space, we say that a sequence of measures \u03c3n converges to a measure \u03c3 in\nthe vague topology if, for any function \u03d5 \u2208 C0(X), we have limn\u2192\u221e \u03c3n(\u03d5) = \u03c3(\u03d5).\nThe sequence {\u00b5\u02c6n}n given in (1) has an accumulation point in the vague topology.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n752 H. Bruin and M. Todd\nDefinition. A probability measure \u00b5 on J is liftable if a vague limit \u00b5\u02c6 obtained in (1) is\nnot identically 0.\nRemark 2. Note that the measure \u00b5 \u25e6 \u03c0 on J\u02c6 is in general \u03c3 -finite, and not f\u02c6 -invariant.\nThe lifted measure \u00b5\u02c6 distributes the mass of \u00b5 over the domains of J\u02c6 so as to become\ninvariant, as we shall see below. Indeed \u00b5 is already called liftable if part of the mass lifts\nto J\u02c6 ; this is to accommodate non-ergodic measures \u00b5. As in [K1], we generally wish to\nexclude the possibility of \u00b5\u02c6 \u2261 0 (where all the mass escapes to infinity). Later we will find\nconditions to ensure that this will not happen.\nThe following theorem extends Theorem 2 of [K1] from ergodic invariant probability\nmeasures to general invariant probability measures.\nTHEOREM 1. Suppose that \u00b5 is an invariant probability measure on J satisfying (SC)\nand (Cr0). If \u00b5\u02c6 is a vague limit point of any subsequence of measures given by (1) then it is\nf\u02c6 -invariant and there is some measurable function 0 \u0002 \u03c1 \u0002 1 such that \u00b5\u02c6 \u25e6 \u03c0\u22121 = \u03c1 \u00b7\u00b5.\nWe will first state the theorem for ergodic invariant probability measures, and then use\nthe ergodic decomposition to generalize to all invariant probability measures.\nPROPOSITION 1. Suppose that \u00b5 is an ergodic invariant probability measure satisfying\n(SC) and (Cr0). If \u00b5\u02c6 is a vague limit point of any subsequence of measures given by (1)\nand \u00b5\u02c6 \t\u2261 0, then \u00b5\u02c6 is an ergodic invariant measure and \u00b5\u02c6 \u25e6 \u03c0\u22121 = \u00b5.\nOnce we have shown that conditions (2.2) and (2.3) of [K1] can be replaced by (SC)\nand (Cr0) then the proposition follows from [K1, Theorem 2].\nTheorem 1 of [K1] implies that any ergodic invariant probability measure \u00b5 can be lifted\nto a finite measure \u00b5\u02c6 by applying (1). The conclusions of that theorem also hold in our\ncase. Conditions (2.2) and (2.3) of that paper need to be assumed there in order to show that\nthe lifting process preserves ergodicity, and thus [K1, Theorem 2] holds. The following\nlemma, which takes the role of [K1, Lemma 1], shows that (SC) and (Cr0) are enough\nin our case to draw the same conclusion here (i.e. lifting preserves ergodicity and hence\nProposition 1 holds).\nDefine I := {A \u2208 B : f\u22121(A) = A} and I\u02c6 := {A \u2208 B\u02c6 : f\u02c6\u22121(A) = A}.\nLEMMA 6. Let \u00b5 satisfy (SC) and (Cr0). Suppose that \u00b5\u02c6 is a vague limit of a subsequence\nof {\u00b5n}n such that \u00b5\u02c6 \u25e6 \u03c0\u22121 = \u00b5. Then \u03c0\u22121(I) = I\u02c6 mod \u00b5\u02c6.\nProof. Suppose that A \u2208 I. Then f\u02c6\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c0\u22121(A) = \u03c0\u22121 \u25e6 f\u22121(A) = \u03c0\u22121(A) and so\n\u03c0\u22121(I) \u2282 I\u02c6.\nConversely, suppose that A\u02c6 \u2208 I\u02c6 and let A = \u03c0(A\u02c6). Let B\u02c6 = A\u02c6 \u0003 \u03c0\u22121(A). We will\nshow that \u00b5\u02c6(B\u02c6) = 0. It follows from (SC) that diam Z\u02c6n[z\u02c6] \u2192 0 for \u00b5\u02c6-a.e. z\u02c6. Furthermore,\n(Cr0) implies that \u00b5\u02c6n(p) = 0 for every n and p \u2208 Cut . Therefore \u00b5\u02c6(p) = 0 as well.\nHence \u00b5\u02c6-a.e. z fulfilling the conditions of Lemma 3 must be in case (a) of that lemma.\n(This is the same as saying that (J\u02c6 , f\u02c6 , \u00b5\u02c6) satisfies condition (2.3) of [K1].)\nTherefore, for \u00b5\u02c6-a.e. z1 \u2208 B\u02c6, there exists z2 \u2208 A\u02c6 and n \u0001 1 such that f\u02c6 n(z1) =\nf\u02c6 n(z2). Hence \u00b5\u02c6(B\u02c6) > 0 implies that A\u02c6 is not invariant; a contradiction, whence\n\u00b5\u02c6(A\u02c6 \u0003 \u03c0\u22121(A)) = 0. Thus, I\u02c6 \u2282 \u03c0\u22121(I) mod \u00b5\u02c6 and the lemma is proved. \u0001\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nMarkov extensions and measures for complex polynomials 753\nRemark 3. If \u00b5\u02c6 is an ergodic invariant probability measure on J\u02c6 such that \u00b5\u02c6 \u25e6 \u03c0\u22121 = \u00b5,\nthen \u00b5 is liftable. This is because it can be shown that, for \u00b5\u02c6n defined as in (1),\n\u00b5\u02c6n(J\u02c6R) \u0001 \u00b5\u02c6(J\u02c6R) for all n,R \u2208 N. Moreover the lift of \u00b5 is absolutely continuous\n(and therefore equal) to \u00b5\u02c6. Also, it follows from the proof of Theorem 2 in [K1] that given\nan ergodic invariant probability measure \u00b5 satisfying (SC) and (Cr0), there is at most one\nergodic f\u02c6 -invariant probability measure \u00b5\u02c6 such that \u00b5\u02c6 \u25e6 \u03c0\u22121 = \u00b5; so \u00b5\u02c6 is unique.\nFor liftable non-invariant measures, for example those considered in \u00a76, the measures\n\u00b5\u02c6 \u25e6 \u03c0\u22121 and \u00b5 are different.\nProof of Theorem 1. Let B the \u03c3 -algebra of \u00b5-measurable sets, and let\n\u00b5(\u00b7) =\n\u222b\nY\n\u00b5y(\u00b7) d\u03bd(y) (2)\nbe the ergodic decomposition of \u00b5. More precisely, the measure space (Y, C, \u03bd) is used\nto index the collection of all ergodic invariant probability measures for (J ,B) and the\nprobability measure \u03bd satisfies (2). The diagram\n(J ,B, \u00b5) f \u0001\u0001\n\u000f\n\u0002\u0002\n(J ,B, \u00b5)\n\u000f\n\u0002\u0002\n(Y, C, \u03bd) id \u0001\u0001 (Y, C, \u03bd)\ncommutes, the map \u000f is such that \u000f(z) = \u000f(z\u2032) if f n(z) = f m(z\u2032) for some n,m \u0001 0,\nand C is the finest \u03c3 -algebra such that \u000f is B-measurable. For each y \u2208 Y , \u000f\u22121(y) is called\nthe carrier of \u00b5y ; it is unique up to sets of \u00b5y -measure 0. For each y \u2208 Y , Proposition 1\nstates that there exists a lifted measure \u00b5\u02c6y as the vague limit of {\u00b5\u02c6y,n}n constructed as\nin (1) (note that the vague limit was independent of the subsequence chosen), and either\n\u00b5\u02c6y \u2261 0 or \u00b5\u02c6y(J\u02c6 ) = 1. Let L = {y \u2208 Y : \u00b5y is liftable}.\nCLAIM. We claim that L \u2208 C; more precisely, there exists L\u2032 \u2208 B such that \u000f : L\u2032 \u2192 C\nis well-defined pointwise, and \u000f(L\u2032) = L.\nProof. To prove this claim, fix a countable C0-dense subset \u0010\u02c6 := {\u03d5\u02c6k}k of C0(J\u02c6 ) and a\ncountable collection of open intervals {Ul}l generating the standard topology ofR. For each\ny \u2208 L, we can use the set Ty of \u00b5y-typical points as carrier. (Recall that z is called\n\u00b5y-typical if the ergodic average (1\/n)\n\u2211n\u22121\ni=0 \u03d5 \u25e6 f i(z) \u2192\n\u222b\n\u03d5 d\u00b5y for each continuous\nfunction \u03d5 : J \u2192 R.) As \u00b5y is liftable, the lifted measure \u00b5\u02c6y has its set T\u02c6y of \u00b5\u02c6y -typical\npoints. Obviously T\u02c6y \u2282 \u03c0\u22121(Ty), and if z\u02c60, z\u02c61 \u2208 \u03c0\u22121(z) \u2229 T\u02c6y , then by Lemma 3, there\nis n such that f\u02c6 n(z\u02c60) = f\u02c6 n(z\u02c61). Therefore \u00b5\u02c6y(\u03c0\u22121(Ty) \u0003 T\u02c6y) = 0, and, a fortiori,\ni \u25e6\u03c0(z\u02c6) \u2208 T\u02c6y for each z\u02c6 \u2208 T\u02c6y .

We start with the following claim: no measure \u00b5\u02c6 obtained by applying (1) to a\nprobability measure \u00b5 can have wandering sets of positive \u00b5\u02c6-measure. Indeed, suppose\nthat A\u02c6 \u2282 J\u02c6 has f\u02c6\u2212n(A\u02c6) \u2229 A\u02c6 = \u2205 for all n \u0001 1.

In fact, any first return map on the Markov extension corresponds to\nan induced (jump) transformation of the original system, and, under mild conditions, the\nreverse is true as well; cf. [Br]. If W\u02c6 \u2282 J\u02c6 , let us write F\u02c6\nW\u02c6\nfor the first return map to W\u02c6 ,\ni.e. F\u02c6 (z) = f\u02c6 \u03c4 (z)(z) where \u03c4 = \u03c4\nW\u02c6\n: W\u02c6 \u2192 N is the first return time to W\u02c6 . Let \u03c4n(z)\ndenote the nth return time, i.e. \u03c4 1(z) = \u03c4 (z) and \u03c4n(z) = \u03c4n\u22121(z) + \u03c4 (F\u02c6 n\u22121(z)). For our\npurposes, we are most interested in subsets W\u02c6 of some domain D \u2208 D that are bounded\naway from the cutpoints of D.

Let D \u2208 D and let\nW\u02c6 \u2282 UD be an open set bounded away from the cutpoints of D such that (using (Cr0))\nv := \u00b5\u02c6(W\u02c6 ) > 0. Take \u03b4 such that UD and W\u02c6 contain round balls of radius \u03b4. Also W\u02c6 is\ncompactly contained in UD , so M := mod(UD, W\u02c6 ) > 0. Let z be a typical point for \u00b5 and\nlet z\u02c6 = i(z).

It follows\nthat \u03c0(z\u02c6) has reached large scale at time i as well and so the first implication follows.\nConversely, suppose that \u00b5-a.e. z satisfies (3). We say that z \u2208 HR if, given z\u02c6 such that\n\u03c0(z\u02c6) = z and B\u03b4(z\u02c6) has mod(UD,B\u03b4) > M , then \u03c0\u22121(ZR[z]) contains no cutpoint of D.\nBy assumptions (SC) and (Cr0), \u00b5(HR) \u2192 1 as R \u2192 \u221e, say \u00b5(HR) > 1 \u2212 \u03b7(R) where\nlimR\u2192\u221e \u03b7(R) = 0.\nIf z reaches large scale for \u03b4 > 0 and M > 0, at iterate j , then for z\u02c6 = i(z) and the\ndomain D \f f\u02c6 j (z\u02c6), Z\u02c6R[f\u02c6 j (z\u02c6)] contains no cutpoint of D. It follows that f\u02c6 j+R(z\u02c6) \u2208 J\u02c6R .\nTherefore, given \u03b5 > 0 and a \u00b5-typical point z, there exists n0(z) such that for n \u0001 n0(z)\n(i) 1\nn\n#{0 \u0002 j < n : f j (z) \u2208 HR} > 1 \u2212 2\u03b7(R),\n(ii) 1\nn\n#{0 \u0002 j < n : f\u02c6 j (z\u02c6) \u2208 J\u02c6R} > v1 + \u03b5 .\nTake M so large that n0(z) \u0002 M for all z in a set of \u00b5-measure\u0001 1 \u2212 \u03b5.

Suppose that (Cr0) is satisfied. For each domain D \u2208 D and \u03b5 > 0, there\nexists \u03b4 > 0 such that if X\u02c6 = \u22c3p\u2208Cut\u2229D B\u03b4(p), then for every invariant probability\nmeasure \u00b5\u02c6 on J\u02c6 , \u00b5\u02c6(X\u02c6) < \u03b5.\nProof. Suppose that D \u2208 D has level(D) = n and p \u2208 CutD := Cut \u2229 D. Then p has\nage m \u0002 n. Since the domain containing f\u02c6 n\u2212m+j (p) must have level at least j + n, p\ncan return to D under iteration by f\u02c6 a maximum of n \u2212 m times. Therefore, there exists\nn0 \u0001 1 such that f n0+k(CutD) \/\u2208 D for all k \u0001 1. So for any j0, there exists \u03b4 > 0 such\nthat f\u02c6 j+n0(B\u03b4(p))\u2229D = \u2205 for 1 \u0002 j \u0002 j0. Take X\u02c6 :=\u22c3p\u2208CutD B\u03b4(p).

Let \u00b5 be an f -invariant probability measure satisfying (SC) and (Cr0), such\nthat \u03bbf (z) > 0 \u00b5-a.e. Then \u00b5 is liftable and \u00b5\u02c6 \u25e6 \u03c0\u22121 \u000e \u00b5.\nProof. We can apply [EL, Theorem 3.17], which says that in this setting there exists a\npartition \u03b7 of J\u02dc into open sets (recall that we are using the relative topology on J\u02dc here)\nsuch that for \u00b5\u02dc-a.e. z\u02dc, f\u02dc has bounded distortion on the element \u03b7(z\u02dc) of \u03b7 containing z\u02dc.\nMore precisely, there is constant K(z\u02dc) \u0001 1 such that\nK(z\u02dc)\u22121 \u0002 |Df\nn(x\u02dcn)|\n|Df n(y\u02dcn)| \u0002 K(z\u02dc)\nfor all n \u0001 0 and components x\u02dcn, y\u02dcn of x\u02dc, y\u02dc \u2208 \u03b7(x\u02dc).

This is a \u00b5\u02dc-measurable function which is strictly positive \u00b5\u02dc-a.e.\nThe general idea behind this result is from Ruelle, see [Ru], and is usually presented\nas a \u2018local unstable manifold theorem\u2019. It is given in the complex setting in [L2] and is\ndiscussed in [EL]. An alternative proof is presented in \u00a79 of [PU].\nNow notice that for any z\u02dc \u2208 J\u02dc , \u03b7(z\u02dc) \u2282 W(z\u02dc) (as defined in Lemma 11), otherwise\n\u03b7(z\u02dc) \u2229 \u2202f kZk[z\u02dck] \t= \u2205 for some k, which implies that distortion is unbounded;\na contradiction.

By Lemma 11, applying (1) to \u00b5 gives a measure \u00b5\u02c6 \t\u2261 0.

Let \u00b5 be an invariant probability measure satisfying (SC) and (Cr0).\nIf the measure theoretical entropy h\u00b5(f ) > 0, then \u00b5 is liftable.\nProof. It follows from the Ruelle inequality [PU] that for ergodic invariant measures, \u03bd,\nh\u03bd(f ) \u0002 2\u03bb(\u03bd). Therefore, if we consider the ergodic decomposition, our assumption\nimplies that there is a positive \u00b5-measure set of z with \u03bbf (z) > 0. Thus Theorem 2\nimplies that \u00b5 is liftable. (In the interval case, Keller [K1] gave a proof based on a\ncounting argument of paths high up in the tower. This type of proof can be used here\ntoo; see Appendix A for our counting argument, which is to be used in the next section.)\u0001\n6. Conformal measure\nIn this section we discuss the liftability properties of conformal measure. Sullivan [Su]\nshowed that all rational maps on the Riemann sphere have a conformal measure for at\nleast one minimal \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 2]. We would like to emphasize that \u00b5\u03b4 is not invariant, but\nwhen \u00b5\u03b4 is liftable, then \u00b5\u02c6\u03b4 (normalized) projects to an invariant probability measure, say\n\u03bd = \u03b1 \u00b7 \u00b5\u02c6\u03b4 \u25e6 \u03c0\u22121, where \u03b1 \u0001 1 is the normalizing constant.\nOur first lemma is that \u03bd is absolutely continuous, generalizing Proposition 1 to\n\u03b4-conformal measure. It can be expected that this lemma generalizes to other non-invariant\nprobability measures too, provided there is distortion control.\nLEMMA 12. Suppose that a conformal measure \u00b5\u03b4 on J satisfies (Cr0). Let \u00b5\u02c6 be a\nmeasure on J\u02c6 obtained as a vague limit of (1).

We suppose that \u00b5\u02c6\u03b4 \t\u2261 0, otherwise there is nothing to prove. Suppose that\n\u00b5\u02c6nk \u2192 \u00b5\u02c6\u03b4 as k \u2192 \u221e.\nIf the lemma is not satisfied then there exists \u03b5 > 0 and a set A\u02c6 \u2282 J\u02c6 which has\n\u00b5\u02c6\u03b4(A\u02c6) > \u03b5, but \u00b5\u03b4(A) = 0 for A = \u03c0(A\u02c6). We may assume that A\u02c6 is contained in some\ndomain D \u2208 D.\nDue to (Cr0), we can assume that A\u02c6 is compactly contained inside UD . Therefore\n\u00b5\u02c6\u03b4(UD) > 0. Choose some B\u02c6 compactly contained in UD with \u00b5\u03b4(B) > 0 where\nB = \u03c0(B\u02c6). We take some neighbourhood U containing both A and B which is compactly\ncontained in UD . There is some C > 0 such that for any x, y \u2208 U , for each branch of the\ninverse map we have \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Df\u02c6\u2212n(x)\nDf\u02c6\u2212n(y)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 < C for all n \u0001 1.\nSupposing that \u03b4 > 0 is the exponent of the conformal measure, we have\n\u00b5\u02c6\u03b4(A\u02c6)\n\u00b5\u02c6\u03b4(B\u02c6)\n= limk\u2192\u221e(1\/nk)\n\u2211nk\u22121\nj=0 \u00b5\u02c60(f\u02c6\u2212j (A\u02c6))\nlimk\u2192\u221e(1\/nk)\n\u2211nk\u22121\nj=0 \u00b5\u02c60(f\u02c6\u2212j (B\u02c6))\n\u0002 C2\u03b4 \u00b5\u03b4(A)\n\u00b5\u03b4(B)\n.\nBut while the left-hand side is positive, the right-hand side is 0, so we have a contradiction.\nThus we obtain absolute continuity as required. \u0001\nCombining Remark 4 and Lemmas 7 and 12, we get the following corollary.\nCOROLLARY 2.

Moreover \u00b5\u02c6\u03b4\u25e6\u03c0\u22121 \u000e \u00b5\u03b4 .\nThe following lemma and theorem are similar to part of the statement of Theorem B\nin [L2]. We supply a proof for completeness.\nLEMMA 13. Assume that conformal measure \u00b5\u03b4 satisfies (SC) and (Cr0). If \u00b5\u03b4 is liftable,\nand \u03bd = \u00b5\u02c6\u03b4 \u25e6 \u03c0\u22121, then \u00b5\u03b4 and \u03bd are equivalent. Moreover, \u00b5\u03b4 and \u03bd are ergodic.\nProof. It was shown in Lemma 12 that \u03bd \u000e \u00b5\u03b4 . Let us prove that \u03c8 := d\u03bd\/d\u00b5\u03b4 is a\npositive density.\nLet A \u2282 J be an open set such that \u03bd(A) > 0. Let \u03bd\u02c6 be the measure obtained\nfrom applying (1) to \u03bd. As \u03bd = \u03bd\u02c6 \u25e6 \u03c0\u22121, there must be some D \u2208 D such that\n\u03bd\u02c6(D \u2229 \u03c0\u22121(A)) > 0. By replacing A by an appropriate cylinder set Z \u2208 Pn, we can\nassume (using (SC) and (Cr0)) that Z\u02c6 := \u03c0\u22121(Z)\u2229D is bounded away from the cutpoints\nof D and such that \u03bd\u02c6(Z\u02c6) > 0. Moreover, as Z\u02c6 \u2208 P\u02c6n, no boundary point of Z\u02c6 (relative\nto D) returns to Z\u02c6.\nLet F\u02c6 be the first return map to Z\u02c6. We will show that we may apply the folklore theorem\nto this map. First note that if Z\u02c6 is chosen sufficiently small, then all the branches of F\u02c6 are\nexpanding and the Koebe lemma implies that they have bounded distortion. Let B\u02c6 \u2282 Z\u02c6 be\nthe set of points in Z\u02c6 which never return to Z\u02c6. We now wish to check that \u00b5\u03b4 \u25e6 \u03c0(B\u02c6) = 0.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n762 H. Bruin and M.

Recall that\n\u03c8 := d\u03bd\/d\u00b5\u03b4. By projecting \u03bd\u02c6Z\u02c6 down to the Julia set, we find that \u03c8 \u0001 \u03c8\u02c6 \u25e6 \u03c0\u22121 > 0\non Z. Let \u03c80 = inf{\u03c8(z) : z \u2208 Z}. Since Z = U \u2229 J for some open set U in C, we can\nfind M such that fM(U) \u2283 J . Let us now prove that \u03c8 > 0 for other points as well.\nLet z \u2208 J \\\u22c3Mi=1 f i(Cr) be arbitrary, and let B \f z be a neighbourhood of z such that\ndiam(B) \u0002 d\n(\nB,\n\u22c3M\ni=1 f i(Cr)\n)\n. Then there is a subset B0 \u2282 U such that fM : B0 \u2192 B\nis univalent.

The uniqueness part is due\nto [DMNU] and parts (a) and (b) are due to [BMO, Lemma 4.2]. We let\nL(f ) :=\n\u22c3\nM>0\n\u22c3\n\u03b4>0\n{z \u2208 J goes to large scale for \u03b4,M > 0 infinitely often}.\nPoints in this set are often referred to as conical points. For a system (X, T ,\u00b5) we say that\nA is lim sup full if lim supn \u00b5(T nA) = 1. We say that T is lim sup full if this property\nholds for all sets of positive measure.\nTHEOREM 3. Suppose that \u00b5\u03b4 is a \u03b4-conformal measure with \u00b5\u03b4(L(f )) > 0. Then \u00b5\u03b4 is\nthe unique measure with this property and\n(a) f is lim sup full, exact, ergodic, conservative, \u00b5 is non-atomic, supp(\u00b5) = J and\n\u03c9(z) = J for \u00b5-a.e. z \u2208 C;\n(b) \u03b4 is the minimal exponent for which a conformal measure with support on J exists.\nNote that (b) implies the well-known fact that for any f and \u03b4 > 0 satisfying the\nconditions of the theorem, \u00b5\u03b4\u2032(L(f )) = 0 for each \u03b4\u2032 > \u03b4. Mayer [Ma] gives an example\nof a polynomial f such that \u00b5\u03b4(L(f )) = 0 for all \u03b4 such that \u03b4-conformal measure \u00b5\u03b4\nexists.\nWe next make an alternative assumption on the behaviour of points under iteration by\nf which guarantees that there is some lifted measure.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nMarkov extensions and measures for complex polynomials 763\nTHEOREM 4. Suppose that (Cr0) is satisfied. Let \u00b5\u03b4 be a \u03b4-conformal measure on J , then\nthe following are equivalent.\n(a) There exists \u03bb > 0 such that \u03bb(z) \u0001 \u03bb for all z in a set of positive \u00b5\u03b4-measure.\n(b) The measure \u00b5\u03b4 is liftable.\nAll of the situations considered in [GS, Pr, Re] give invariant probability measures\n\u00b5 \u000e \u00b5\u03b4 for some \u03b4-conformal measure with \u03bbf (\u00b5) > 0. Therefore, all of those cases fit\ninto our setting. The closest result to ours that we know of is [GS] where the measure \u00b5\nwas obtained whenever the rational function f satisfied a summability condition on the\nderivatives of critical orbits.\nCOROLLARY 3. If there is a liftable probability measure \u00b5 \u000e \u00b5\u03b4 , then \u03b4 = dimH(\u00b5)\n(where dimH stands for Hausdorff dimension).\nProof. Since \u00b5 is liftable, so is \u00b5\u03b4. By Lemma 13, \u00b5 is ergodic and by Theorem 4,\n\u00b5 must have positive Lyapunov exponent. Pesin\u2019s formula in [PU, Ch. 10] implies that\n\u03b4 = dimH(\u00b5). \u0001\nTo prove Theorem 4, we will need the following results. Define sR(n,D) to be the\nmaximal number of n-paths originating from an element D \u2208 D, level(D) = R and not\nre-entering J\u02c6R . Let\nsR(n) := max{sR(n,D) : level(D) = R}.\nLEMMA 14. Let N := #P1 \u0002 \u2211c \u03bacdc. For each R, there exists a C > 0 such that , for\nall 0 \u0002 j < R,\nsR(nR + j) \u0002 C(2RN)n+1.\nThe proof of this lemma is in Appendix A.\nProof of Theorem 4 assuming Lemma 14. First assume that (b) holds, and let \u00b5\u02c6\u03b4 be the\nlifted measure. By Lemma 7, \u00b5\u02c6\u03b4 is invariant and by Lemma 12, \u00b5\u02c6\u03b4 \u25e6\u03c0\u22121 \u000e \u00b5. Therefore\nProposition 2 implies that (a) holds.\nNow assume that (a) holds. We will use a counting argument to prove that a positive\nmeasure set of points must return to some J\u02c6R with positive frequency, from which\nliftability follows.\nFor 1 < \u03bb0 < \u03bb, R, n \u0001 1 and \u03b5 > 0 we consider the set\nB\u03bb0,R,n(\u03b5) :=\n{\nz : |Df n(z)| > \u03bbn0 and\n1\nn\n#{0 \u0002 j < n : f\u02c6 j (i(z)) \u2208 J\u02c6R} \u0002 \u03b5\n}\n.\nWe let PB,n denote the collection of cylinder sets of Pn which intersect B\u03bb0,R,n. Since \u00b5\u03b4\nis \u03b4-conformal, we can compute that \u00b5\u03b4(B\u03bb0,R,n(\u03b5)) \u0002 \u03bb\u2212\u03b4n0 #PB,n. We will prove that by\ntaking R0 \u0001 1 and \u03b5 > 0 appropriately, this is arbitrarily small in n, which leads us to\nconclude that a positive measure set must visit J\u02c6R0 with positive frequency.\nNotice that any Z \u2208 Pn uniquely determines a path D0(Z\u02c6) \u2192 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2192 Dn\u22121(Z\u02c6) in J\u02c6\ngiven by Z\u02c6 = i(Z), f\u02c6 j (Z\u02c6) \u2282 Dj (Z\u02c6) \u2208 D, and vice versa. In our case, given P \u2208 PB,n,\nwe let P\u02c6 = i(P ), we have a path defined in J\u02c6 .

We fix some R \u0001 1 and a domain\nD \u2208 D, level(D) = R. We say that:\n\u2022 a t-path survives if the path starts in D and never falls into J\u02c6R;\n\u2022 a domain is surviving at time t if it is the terminal domain of a surviving t-path;\n\u2022 a cutpoint z is a surviving cutpoint at time t if it lies in the terminal domain of a\nsurviving t-path.\nDefine\nLt (m) := #{surviving m-cutpoints in t-paths starting from D}.\nSince for a path D \u2192 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2192 D\u2032, each cutpoint in D has only one image in D\u2032, we have\nLt (m) \u0002 Lt\u2212l (m \u2212 l) for 1 \u0002 l \u0002 m \u0002 t, (A.1)\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nMarkov extensions and measures for complex polynomials 765\nwhich is a rule we will apply repeatedly. Moreover, since the terminal domain of each\nsurviving t-path contains at least one l-cutpoint for R < l \u0002 R + t , we find Lt(j) = 0 for\nj > t + R and\nLt (1) \u0002 N \u00b7 #{surviving (t \u2212 1)-paths} \u0002 N\n(R+t\u22121\u2211\nl=R+1\nLt\u22121(l)\n)\n, (A.2)\nwhere N = #P1. Using these rules, we prove the following lemma.\nLEMMA 16. Suppose that (n \u2212 1)R < t \u0002 nR; then\nLt (j) \u0002\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n2nRnNn+1 if 0 < j \u0002 t;\nN if t < j \u0002 t + R;\n0 if t + R < j.\n(A.3)\nProof. Since every terminal domain of a t-path has level\u0002 t+R, Lt (j) = 0 for j > t+R.\nThis proves the third inequality. Before we prove the remaining part by induction, let us\ncompute what happens for t \u0002 R.\nt = 0. The maximal number of 1-cutpoints possible in a single domain is #Cr \u0002 N . So in\nparticular L0(1) \u0002 N . By Lemma 2, L0(l) \u0002 N for 1 \u0002 l \u0002 R.\nt = 1. By rule (A.1), L1(j + 1) = L0(j) \u0002 N for 1 \u0002 j \u0002 R. By rule (A.2), L1(1) \u0002 N .\nt = 2. By rule (A.1), L2(2 + j) = L0(j) \u0002 N for 1 \u0002 j \u0002 R. Similarly, L2(2) =\nL1(1) \u0002 N . Also L2(1) \u0002 N2 by rule (A.2).\nt \u0002 R. As before\nLt(j) = L0(j \u2212 t) \u0002 N for t < j \u0002 t + R,\nand\nLt (j) \u0002 Lt\u2212j+1(1) \u0002 N#{(t \u2212 j )-surviving paths}\n\u0002 N\nt\u2212j+R\u2211\nl=R+1\nLt\u2212j (l) \u0002 (t \u2212 j)N2 \u0002 RN2 by rule (A.2),\nfor 0 < j \u0002 t .\nIt follows that if t < j \u0002 t +R, then Lt (j) = L0(j \u2212 t) \u0002 N . So now we have proved\nthe second inequality of the lemma for all t , and the first inequality for t \u0002 R.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n766 H. Bruin and M. Todd\nWe continue by induction on n. So assume that (A.3) holds for n and that nR < t \u0002\n(n + 1)R and j \u0002 t . Then\nLt (j) = Lt\u2212j+1(1) \u0002 N\nt\u2212j+R\u2211\nl=R+1\nLt\u2212j (l) by rule (A.2)\n\u0002 RN2 + N\nt\u2212j\u2211\nl=R+1\nLt\u2212j (l) by the induction hypothesis for l > t \u2212 j\n\u0002 RN2 + N\nt\u2212j\u2211\nl=R+1\nLt\u2212j\u2212l+1(1) by rule (A.1)\n\u0002 RN2 + N\nt\u2212j\u2212R\u2211\ns=1\nLs(1)\n\u0002 RN2 + N\nn\u2211\nd=1\ndR\u2211\ns=(d\u22121)R+1\nLs(1)\n\u0002 RN2 + N\nn\u2211\nd=1\ndR\u2211\ns=(d\u22121)R+1\n2dRdNd+1 by the induction hypothesis\n\u0002 RN2 + RN2\nn\u2211\nd=1\n(2RN)d \u0002 RN2\n(\n1 + (2RN)\nn+1 \u2212 2RN\n2RN \u2212 1\n)\n\u0002 RN2\n(\n(2RN)n\n1 \u2212 1\/(2RN)\n)\n\u0002 2n+1Rn+1Nn+2.\nThis proves the induction step, and hence the lemma. \u0001\nProof of Lemma 14. Since there cannot be more surviving nR-paths than surviving\ncutpoints at time nR we can estimate sR using Lt (j). We use rules (A.1) and (A.2) as\nin the previous proof:\nsR(nR + j) = #{(nR + j )-surviving paths}\n\u0002\nnR+j+R\u2211\nl=R+1\nLnR+j (l) by rule (A.2)\n\u0002 RN2 +\nnR+j\u2211\nl=R+1\nLnR+j\u2212l+1(1) by rule (A.1) and Lemma 16\n\u0002 RN2 +\n(n\u22121)R+j\u2211\ns=1\nLs(1)\n\u0002 RN2 +\nn\u2211\nd=1\ndR\u2211\ns=(d\u22121)R+1\nLs(1)\n\u0002 RN2 +\nn\u2211\nd=1\ndR\u2211\ns=(d\u22121)R+1\n(2RN)d+1 by Lemma 16\n\u0002 C(2RN)n+1,\nfor some constant C > 0. \u0001\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nMarkov extensions and measures for complex polynomials 767\nREFERENCES\n[Ab] L.
