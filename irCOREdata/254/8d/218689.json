This invariably turns out to be England. At present, there is a media \ncampaign, originating in the United States but echoed in England, claiming that libel \ntourism is undermining free speech.\n2\n The purpose of this note is to consider whether \nthese claims are justified. Only questions of conflict of laws will be discussed.\n3\n \n \nI. THE PROBLEM \n \nWe all believe in free speech. We also believe that people should be protected from \ndefamation. There is a potential conflict between these two values and the law has to \nattempt some kind of balance. In some countries, the balance tilts in favour of free \nspeech; in others, it tilts in favour of protecting reputation. England is one of the most \nextreme members of the latter category: English libel law is generally regarded as the \n                                                 \n* Professor of Law Emeritus, London School of Economics. \n1\n http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Libel_tourism. \n2\n See, for example, United Kingdom Parliament, Hansard, 17 December 2008: Column 69WH; The Times \n(London), 18 December 2008, p. 27; The New York Times, 26 May 2009 (editorial). Libel tourism is \napparently being considered by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, a standing committee of the \nHouse of Commons chaired by John Whittingdale MP. \n3\n The leading treatment of the subject in England is Morse, \u201cRights Relating to Personality, Freedom of the \nPress and Private International Law: Some Common Law Comments\u201d (2005) 58 Current Legal Problems \n133. \n \n 2 \nmost claimant-friendly in the world. Under it, the claimant has a prima facie case once he \nhas established that the defendant has published a defamatory statement about him. He \ndoes not have to prove that the statement is false (though the defendant has a good \nd\u00e9fense if he can prove it is true) and he does not have to prove that the defendant acted \nout of malice. Damages can be high by international standards. No wonder that the rich \nand the famous come from the four corners of the globe to bring libel actions in England.  \n \n The problem is that if English courts assume jurisdiction in too wide a range of \ncases (and if they apply English law), countries that give more weight to free speech \ncould legitimately complain that the English courts were undermining their freedoms. \nOur first task, therefore, is to examine English conflict-of-laws rules in libel actions in \norder to ascertain whether they achieve a fair balance between the competing interests. \n \nII. THE LEGAL BACKGROUND \n \nThe problem has both a choice-of-law element and a jurisdictional element. We will \nconsider the choice-of-law element first, though, as we shall see, jurisdiction is actually \nmore important. Before we consider either, however, a point of terminology must be \nexplained. \n \nA. Terminology \n \n 3 \nIn English legal terminology, each time an item is communicated to another person, there is \na \u201cpublication\u201d. Each sale of a newspaper is a separate publication in English eyes; and each \ntime a viewer watches a television program there is also a \u201cpublication\u201d.4 The place of \npublication is the place where this occurs. If a French newspaper sells even a single copy in \nEngland, there is publication in England (as well as in France); the same is true if a French \nradio station makes a broadcast that is heard in England. Lawyers from Continental Europe \nusually use different terminology. They would say that the French newspaper was \n\u201cpublished\u201d in France and was merely \u201cdistributed\u201d in England.5 Readers from the \nContinent should be aware that English lawyers use these terms differently. \n \nB. No \u201cSingle-Publication\u201d Rule \n \nUnlike the United States,\n6\n England does not apply a \u201csingle-publication\u201d rule. The principle \nthat each communication of the offending material constitutes a separate tort applies with \nregard to choice of law, jurisdiction and forum non conveniens. This means that the \napplicable law may be different with regard to publication in different countries and that the \nEnglish courts may have jurisdiction with regard to those torts founded on publication in \nEngland, but not with regard to those torts founded on publication in other countries.  \n \nC. Choice of Law \n \n                                                 \n4\n Duke of Brunswick v. Harmer (1849) 14 QB 185. \n5\n For this reason, the European Court of Justice did not use the words, \u201cpublish\u201d, \u201cpublication\u201d, etc. in the \nShevill case (discussed below). \n6\n Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc. 465 US 770; 104 S Ct 1473; 79 L Ed. 2d 790 (US Supreme Court, \n1984). \n 4 \nIn England, choice of law in tort was codified by the Private International Law \n(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995; however, defamation was excluded from this \nstatute.\n7\n Subsequently, choice of law in tort was almost entirely taken over by EC law,\n8\n \nbut again defamation was excluded.\n9\n The result is that the common law still applies. \nUnder the general common-law rule applied in England for choice of law in tort, a tort \ncommitted in a foreign country will be actionable in England if, and only if, it is \nactionable under the foreign law (it must be civilly actionable: it is not enough if is a \ncriminal offence) and it is actionable as a tort under English law (the so-called \u201cdouble-\nactionability\u201d rule).10 Where the tort is committed in England, on the other hand, English \nlaw alone will be applied.\n11\n \n \n It follows from this, that if the claimant limits his claim to a remedy for \npublication in England \u2013 as he invariably does, for jurisdictional reasons if for no others \u2013 \nthe court will apply English law alone. Foreign publication, even if much more \nsignificant than English publication, will be ignored. This is one of the consequences of \nthe English concept of publication and the view that each publication constitutes a \nseparate tort. \n \nD. Jurisdiction \n \n                                                 \n7\n Sections 9(3), 10 and 13. \n8\n The Rome II Regulation, EC Regulation 864\/2007, OJ 2007, L190\/40. \n9\n Article 1(2)(g). \n10\n Dicey, Morris & Collins, The Conflict of Laws (Sweet and Maxwell, London, 14\nth\n edn, 2006 by Sir \nLawrence Collins with specialist editors) (hereinafter \u201cDicey, Morris & Collins\u201d), Rule 235, pp. 1957 et \nseq. \n11\n Dicey, Morris & Collins, p. 1960, text to, and cases cited in, note 2. \n 5 \nSince there cannot be (and is not) any objection to actions being brought in England \nwhen the defendant is domiciled\n12\n in England or in another part of the United Kingdom, \nwe shall focus on the position where he is domiciled outside the UK. Where he is \ndomiciled in another EU Member State,\n13\n the jurisdiction of the English courts is \ndetermined by EU law (the Brussels I Regulation).\n14\n Where he is not domiciled in any \nsuch State, the present position is that English rules of jurisdiction apply (this may \nchange when the Brussels I Regulation is revised). We consider each of these situations \nseparately. \n \n 1. Defendant domiciled in a Member State \n \nThe leading case in EU law is Shevill v. Presse Alliance SA.\n15\n  In this case, a claimant \ndomiciled in England (together with her French employer) brought a libel action in \nEngland against a French newspaper. The newspaper, France Soir, sold approximately \n200,000 copies in France; in England it sold something in the region of 250. There was no \nevidence that anyone who had read the article knew the claimant or her employer. The \nclaimants, who limited their claim to damages for the copies sold in England, asserted that \nthe English courts had jurisdiction under what is now Article 5(3) of the Brussels I \n                                                 \n12\n In this paper, \u201cdomicile\u201d is used in the sense in which it applies for the purpose of jurisdiction under the \nBrussels I Regulation. See The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Order 2001, SI 2001 No. 3929, paragraph \n9 (individuals) and the Brussels I Regulation, Article 60 (companies). This concept is not very different \nfrom residence, or domicile as applied in the United States. It is much more flexible than the traditional \nEnglish concept of domicile. \n13\n The position is the same when the defendant is domiciled in a State Party to the Lugano Convention, a \nconvention signed in the Swiss city of Lugano on 16 September 1988. The original text of the Lugano \nConvention may be found in OJ 1988, L 319, p. 25. The Parties to the Lugano Convention have fluctuated \nover time; at present the non-EU Parties (often referred to as the \u201cLugano States\u201d) are Iceland, Norway and \nSwitzerland. Henceforth, references to a Member State of the EU should be regarded as including \nreferences to a Lugano State. \n14\n Regulation 44\/2001, OJ 2001, L 12\/1. \n15\n Case C-68\/93, [1995] ECR I-415. \n 6 \nRegulation,\n16\n a provision which confers jurisdiction on the courts for the place where the \n\u201charmful event\u201d occurred. \n \n The European Court held that, in international libel cases in which jurisdiction is \nclaimed under Article 5(3), the claimant may bring proceedings either in the courts for the \nplace where the material is distributed or in the courts for the place where the publisher is \n\u201cestablished\u201d. This latter concept will generally coincide with domicile and need not \nconcern us further. Where jurisdiction is based on distribution (publication), the claim must \nbe limited to damage flowing from the copies of the publication distributed in the territory of \nthe forum.  \n \n 2. Defendant not domiciled in a Member State  \n \nAt present, English rules of jurisdiction apply when the defendant is not domiciled in a \nMember State. Under these, jurisdiction may be obtained either by serving a writ on the \ndefendant during his temporary presence in England (a ground of jurisdiction that rarely \napplies in libel cases),\n17\n or by serving it outside the jurisdiction under Section IV, Part 6, of \nthe English Civil Procedure Rules and Practice Direction 6B, rule 3(1)(9). Rule 3(1)(9), \nwhich was derived from ECJ case-law,\n18\n provides for jurisdiction, where the claim is made \nin tort, if either (a) damage was sustained within the jurisdiction, or (b) the damage \n                                                 \n16\n At the time, the relevant provision was Article 5(3) of the Brussels Convention, which was expressed in \nidentical terms. \n17\n If there was no publication in England, the action would be stayed on the ground of forum non \nconveniens. If there was such publication, the same thing would probably happen unless the claim was \nlimited to damages resulting from publication in England. \n18\n Bier v. Mines de Potasse, Case 21\/76, [1976] ECR 1735. \n 7 \nsustained resulted from an act committed within the jurisdiction. As applied to libel, it \ngives jurisdiction only with regard to items published (distributed) in England.\n19\n The \nresult is that the jurisdictional rules are much the same under both EU law and under \nEnglish law. \n \n There is, however, one difference. Where jurisdiction is derived from English \nlaw, the doctrine of forum non conveniens applies.\n20\n Under this, English courts stay the \nproceedings if the courts of another country are a clearly more appropriate forum. \nHowever, if the claimant limits his claim to a remedy for publication in England, the \nEnglish courts will apply forum non conveniens solely on the basis of such publication.\n 21\n \nPublication outside England will not be taken into consideration. Since England does not \nhave a \u201csingle-publication\u201d rule, the English courts will not lump together all instances in \nwhich the material is communicated and apply forum non conveniens on that basis.\n22\n The \nresult is that the courts inevitably conclude that England is the most appropriate forum for \ngranting a remedy for publication in England.  \n \n The only exception is where the claimant has no substantial reputation in \nEngland. However, libel claimants are usually international business persons, film stars, \npop singers or sportsmen: if they do not have a great deal of money they will not be able \n                                                 \n19\n If publication in England was minimal, the court might strike out the proceedings for abuse of process: \nJameel (Yousef) v. Dow Jones & Co Inc. [2005] QB 946; [2005] 2 WLR 1614 (CA). This remedy would \nprobably be applicable even if the English court had jurisdiction under EC law, since it is not based on \njurisdictional considerations. \n20\n Forum non conveniens cannot apply where the jurisdiction of the English court is derived from EC law: \nOwusu v. Jackson, Case C-281\/02, [2005] ECR I-1383; [2005] QB 801; [2005] 2 WLR 942; [2005] 2 All \nER (Comm.) 577; [2005] 1 Lloyd's Rep 452 (ECJ). \n21\n King v. Lewis [2004] EWCA Civ 1329 (CA). \n22\n Berezovsky v. Michaels [2000] 1 WLR 1004; [2000] 2 All ER 986 (HL). See per Lord Steyn [2000] 1 \nWLR at pp. 1012\u20131013. \n 8 \nto afford to bring proceedings in England. Such people can usually claim to have a \nreputation in England. In the case of business persons, they would have to show that they \nhad business interests in England. If they did, they would not have to show that they were \nwidely known, simply that they were known to the particular group of business people \nwith whom they normally carried on business.\n23\n For these reasons, forum non conveniens, \nthough useful in some cases, has only a limited effect.  \n \nIII. ASSESSMENT \n \nWe are now in a position to assess whether criticisms concerning libel tourism are \njustified. At first sight, it might seem that there are not. English courts claim jurisdiction \nonly when there is publication (distribution) of the offending material in England, and the \nremedy must be limited to harm resulting from that material. Who could complain about \nthat? \n \n Unfortunately things are not so simple. The first problem concerns the concept of \npublication. English courts take the view that material on the Internet is published in \nEngland whenever it can be downloaded in England. There is no requirement of \ntargeting. Since all material on the Internet can normally be downloaded anywhere, this \nmeans that all material on the Internet is regarded as being published in England.\n24\n \nAlmost all major newspapers, news magazines, news agencies and TV networks have an \n                                                 \n23\n Persons in the entertainment industry would have to show that they had fans in England or that their \nwork was marketed here. \n24\n King v. Lewis [2004] EWCA Civ 1329 (CA). A similar rule applies in the Commonwealth: Dow Jones & \nCo Inc. v. Gutnick (2003) 210 CLR 575; 77 ALJR 255; 194 ALR 433 (High Court of Australia).  \n 9 \nInternet edition, available from their websites.\n25\n This means that, in the case of \nnewspaper and TV reports, as well as other Internet material, the requirement of \npublication in England is meaningless. Moreover, most printed books are available from \nInternet suppliers, such as Amazon.\n26\n They too can be regarded as published everywhere. \nFor these reasons, it is fair to say that the requirement of publication in England no longer \nconstitutes a significant safeguard against exorbitant jurisdiction. Thus, for example, if \none American resident puts material on the Internet that allegedly libels another \nAmerican resident, the latter may sue for libel in England, provided he has a reputation \nthere.\n27\n  \n \n This might still not be regarded as a problem since, under both EC and English \nlaw, the remedy must be limited to damages resulting from publication in England. The \nproblem is that it is not possible in practice to limit the scope of the remedy so that it does \nnot have an impact on publication in other countries. In the realm of information, the \nworld is one unit: individual countries cannot be isolated from the rest.  \n \n The case of Bin Mahfouz v. Ehrenfeld\n28\n provides an example. Rachel Ehrenfeld \nwas an Israeli-American who wrote books on terrorism. In one of her books, she claimed \nthat Khalid Mahfouz, an eminent Saudi businessman, was responsible for financing \ninternational terrorism.  The book was published in the US. It seems that it was not \n                                                 \n25\n In the case of France Soir, it is http:\/\/www.francesoir.fr\/. So if the Shevill case occurred today, it would \nnot be necessary to show that any copies of the newspaper had been distributed in England. \n26\n For the US, see http:\/\/www.Amazon.com; for England, see http:\/\/www.Amazon.co.uk; for France, \nhttp:\/\/www.Amazon.fr. \n27\n King v. Lewis [2004] EWCA Civ 1329 (CA). In this case, the claimant, Don King, was an American \nboxing promoter, who had promoted boxing matches in England. This was held to be sufficient. \n28\n [2005] EWHC 1156 (QB). \n 10 \nmarketed in the United Kingdom: Ehrenfeld claimed that she and her publisher, an \nAmerican firm, had never taken any steps to make it available there. However, a number \nof copies were sold via the Internet in England \u2013 the judgment mentioned 23 \u2013 and the \nfirst chapter was available on an American website which could be accessed in \nEngland.\n29\n  \n \n Mahfouz and his two sons brought proceedings in England for libel against \nEhrenfeld and her publisher. Jurisdiction was based on publication in England. Ehrenfeld \ndid not defend \u2013 she claimed she did not have the financial resources to do so30 \u2013 and a \ndefault judgment was obtained. A declaration of falsity was made, and the claimants \n(Mahfouz and his two sons) were granted damages of \u00a310,000 each. Ehrenfeld was also \nordered to pay costs. The total sum is said to have been almost \u00a3115,000 (at the then \nexchange rate this was something in the region of $200,000, more than \u20ac135,000). In \naddition, an injunction was issued requiring Ehrenfeld and her publisher not to publish \nthe material in England. \n \n Since the damages awarded \u2013 for the distribution of just 23 copies of the book \u2013 \nwere far greater than the likely profits from publication worldwide, the effect of the \naward, if known in advance, would have been to deter the author from publishing at all. \nMoreover, the defendants were ordered not to publish the material in England. This \ninjunction would have required the material not to be put on the Internet and hard copies \n                                                 \n29\n ABCNews.com. \n30\n Nevertheless, she was subsequently able to bring quite lengthy proceedings against Mahfouz in New \nYork, a jurisdiction where attorney fees do not seem to be any lower than in England. See Ehrenfeld v. \nMahfouz, note 33*, below. \n 11 \nnot to be sold through on-line booksellers like Amazon. This would have had a severe \nimpact on marketing in other countries.\n31\n For these reasons, a remedy granted for \npublication in England will almost always have an impact on freedom to publish in other \ncountries. The requirement that the remedy be limited to compensation for distribution in \nEngland is virtually meaningless. \n \n Although the Ehrenfeld case resulted in legal proceedings (undefended though \nthey were), many cases do not get that far. Defendants give in at the mere threat of a law \nsuit. It has been said that wealthy businessmen in East European countries, including \nsome EU Member States, have found the threat of libel proceedings in England to be an \neffective means of securing the removal from websites in their countries of material that \nreveals corrupt activities on their part.\n32\n If proceedings were brought, the defendants \nwould be unable to defend themselves because they could not afford the fees charged by \nLondon lawyers. So they have no option but to back down. \n \n One can conclude from this that libel tourism is a genuine problem. Libel \nproceedings, or the threat of libel proceedings, in England can unjustifiably undermine \nfree speech in other countries.  \n \nIV. REACTION IN THE UNITED STATES \n                                                 \n31\n In fact, Ehrenfeld did not obey the judgment, and no attempt was made to enforce it in the United States, \nwhere it would almost certainly have been refused recognition. So Ehrenfeld and her publisher were able to \ncontinue marketing the book there. The position would have been different, however, if she or her publisher \nhad had assets in the United Kingdom (or another EU Member State), which would be the case with most \nmajor American publishers. In any event, it is hardly a recommendation for a ground of jurisdiction that it \ndoes no harm as long as the resulting judgments are not enforced in other countries. \n32\n Information supplied at a conference held at the London School of Economics on 20 January 2009. \n 12 \n \nAfter the proceedings in the English courts, Ehrenfeld sued in a federal court in New \nYork (SDNY) for a declaration that, under federal and New York law, Mahfouz could not \nprevail on a libel claim against her based upon the statements at issue in the English \naction and that the English default judgment was unenforceable in the United States. \nMahfouz claimed that the American courts lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. This claim \nwas upheld by the New York Court of Appeals, to which the matter was referred by the \nSecond Circuit: Mahfouz lacked sufficient contacts with New York to justify the \nassertion of jurisdiction.\n33\n \n \n Her next step was to get legislation adopted by the New York State Legislature. \nThis is rather provocatively entitled \u201cThe Libel Terrorism (sic) Protection Act\u201d.34 It \namends the New York legislation for the recognition of foreign judgments to provide that \na foreign defamation judgment will not be recognized unless the defamation law applied \nby the foreign court provided at least as much protection for free speech as would be \nprovided by the Constitutions of the United States and New York. The legislation also \nconfers jurisdiction on the New York courts to hear actions brought by New York \nresidents (and certain other persons) for declaratory judgments\n35\n against persons who \nhave obtained defamation judgments against them in foreign countries.\n36\n Similar \nlegislation has been passed in some other states. \n \n                                                 \n33\n Ehrenfeld v. Mahfouz 9 NY 3d 501; 881 NE 2d 830; 851 NYS 2d 381 (2007). \n34\n Laws of New York, 2008, Chapter 66. \n35\n Including a declaration that the defamation judgment will not be recognized in New York. \n36\n The constitutionality of this jurisdictional provision may be open to question. \n 13 \n Bills have been introduced in the US Congress for a Free Speech Protection Act.\n37\n \nIf enacted as they stand, they would allow a \u201cUnited States person\u201d38 against whom a \ndefamation judgment has been obtained in a foreign country to bring proceedings in the \nUnited States to obtain declaratory relief, injunctions, compensatory damages and, in \ncertain cases, treble damages against the person who brought the defamation proceedings.  \n \nV. A FAIR BALANCE \n \nIt will be seen from the above that English libel laws have given rise to an international \nproblem. One solution would be to change the substantive law of libel in England. This \nmay happen one day, but it is unlikely to come about as the result of international \nconcerns. For the present time at least, a solution must be found through conflict of laws. \nFor this, we must accept that all countries are entitled to their own views on the balance \nbetween free speech and the protection of reputation. The objective of conflict of laws is \nto ensure that one country does not impose its views on others. A solution could be found \neither through choice of law or through jurisdiction. At this point, we need not choose \nbetween them: our first task is simply to analyze the competing interests. In doing this, \nwe will take the example of the United States as a country which gives significantly \ngreater protection to free speech (compared with defamation) than England.\n39\n  \n \n                                                 \n37\n Similar, but not identical, bills were introduced in the House of Representatives (HR 5814) on 16 April \n2008 and the Senate (S 449) on 13 February 2009.  \n38\n Defined, in slightly different terms, in section 6(5) of the House bill and 5(6) of the Senate bill. \n39\n For this purpose, it is reasonable to regard the United States as a single unit, rather than to look at the \nindividual US state in question, since the protection of free speech, being largely a matter of constitutional \nlaw, is a national concern. If individual states gave even greater protection, a further analysis at the state \nlevel might be necessary.  \n 14 \n The first situation is the easiest one. If the claimant is domiciled in the United \nStates and the defendant is domiciled in England, there is no problem. The United States \nhas no interest in the protection of the free speech of a person domiciled in England. If \nEnglish courts want to take jurisdiction and to apply English law, that does not affect \nAmerican interests. There is, therefore, no need to change the law in this situation. \n \n If, on the other hand, the claimant and defendant are both domiciled in the United \nStates, the US has a great interest in protecting the free speech of the defendant and \nEngland has no interest in protecting the reputation of the claimant. So here, American \ninterests should prevail. The only exception is that if the defendant goes out of his or her \nway to target England so that publication is England is clearly more significant than that \nin any other country of the world, England would have a legitimate interest in granting a \nremedy, at least if the defendant had a significant reputation in England.  \n \n A similar analysis could be made where the defendant is domiciled in the United \nStates and the claimant is domiciled in a third country, except perhaps where a fair trial \ncould not be expected in the claimant\u2019s country. \n \n We now come to the most difficult situation. This is where the claimant is \ndomiciled in England and the defendant is domiciled in the US. Here each country has a \nlegitimate interest in protecting its own person. The United States would want to protect \nthe free speech of the defendant; England would want to protect the reputation of the \nclaimant. No reconciliation is possible. Provided there is publication in England, English \n 15 \ncourts would take jurisdiction and apply English law. They cannot be criticized for that. \nAmerican courts would refuse to recognize the resulting judgment (and possibly grant \ndeclarations). They cannot be criticized for that. To this extent, legislation such as that in \nNew York is not unreasonable.\n40\n \n \n What can we conclude from this analysis? It is suggested that the law applied by \nEnglish courts (whether English or EU law) should be changed so as to give effect to the \nsuperior interest of foreign countries in cases where neither party is domiciled in England \nand the defendant has not specially targeted England. \n \nVI. HOW IS THIS TO BE DONE? \n \nFinding a practical solution is not straightforward, since two branches of conflict of laws \n\u2013 choice of law and jurisdiction \u2013 are involved, and two jurisdictions \u2013 England and the \nEuropean Union \u2013 might have to take action.  \n \nA. Choice of Law \n \n                                                 \n40\n Treble damages, however, are another matter. Legislation along these lines would invite retaliation. The \nvehicle for such retaliation is already at hand. Section 6 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 \ncontains a \u201cclaw-back\u201d provision allowing a person who has been required to pay treble damages in \nanother country to claim them back from the person to whom they were paid. Any such judgment would be \nrecognized in the European Union, the Lugano States (see note 13*, above), and Australia. For the \nEuropean Union, see the Brussels I Regulation, Chapter III; for the Lugano States, the equivalent \nprovisions of the Lugano Convention (see note 13*, above); for Australia, the Foreign Proceedings (Excess \nof Jurisdiction) Act 1984, section 12. \n 16 \nAt the present time, a solution based on choice of law would have to come from England, \nsince the matter is at present governed by English law. However, the EU measure on \nchoice of law in tort (the Rome II Regulation)\n41\n should in principle cover choice of law \nfor defamation. It was excluded only because it was impossible to find a solution that was \nacceptable to all concerned. This is not the end of the matter, however, since the EC \nCommission is supposed to be undertaking a study with a view to further legislation.\n42\n \nOne day, a solution might be found and incorporated into the Regulation. \n \n It is not easy to formulate a clear-cut rule \u2013 the kind preferred by Continental \nconflicts lawyers \u2013 for insertion into the Rome II Regulation. Of the various possibilities \noriginally considered, the application of the law of the claimant\u2019s domicile had some \ninitial support. However, it proved unacceptable because of the serious problems that \ncould result: for example, it might be impossible for the press to criticize a foreign \ndictator if the law of his country declared that any such criticism was ipso facto \ndefamatory. \n \n If a solution were to come from a change of English law, a more nuanced \napproach would be possible. Perhaps the best one could come up with would be a rule \nsuch as the following:  \n \n                                                 \n41\n Note 8*, above. \n42\n The Commission was supposed to report by the end of 2008: see Article 30(2) of the Regulation. This did \nnot happen and it is unlikely that a solution will be found in the near future. \n 17 \n(a) The provisions of this [section] shall apply for the purpose of determining the applicable law in \nproceedings for defamation in which the defendant is not domiciled in any part of the United \nKingdom. \n \n(b) For the purpose of this [section], all instances of publication of defamatory material anywhere \nin the world shall be treated as a single tort and given equal weight, even if the claim is restricted \nto a remedy for publication in the United Kingdom or some part thereof. \n \n(c) The applicable law for the tort of defamation shall be the law of the country with which the tort \nis most closely connected. \n \nWhile admittedly vague, this at least requires the court to consider the worldwide picture, \neven if the claim is limited to publication in England. In effect, it establishes a single-\npublication rule for choice of law. A rule along these lines might one day be introduced \nby the courts, though this is far from certain. If legislation were to be adopted, it would \nhave to be a statute, since there is no other way in which it could be done. The problem \nhere is that the legislative timetable in Parliament is usually congested with more urgent \nbusiness and \u201cmere\u201d law reform is often pushed to the back of the queue.  \n \n In addition, a solution through choice of law gives rise to other difficulties. The \nfirst is that, in a field such as defamation, values and attitudes are often as important as \nthe black-letter rule. Moreover, English judges might be unwilling to apply some aspects \nof US law on public-policy grounds. For these reasons, US law applied by an English \ncourt might be significantly different from US law applied by an American court. \n \n 18 \n A second problem is that the vague and open-ended character of the rule could \ngive rise to extensive litigation. Many defendants might be unable to afford this. If a \nforeign defendant is financially unable to defend a case on the merits, he or she is \nunlikely to be able to fight a series of appeals on choice-of-law issues. For these reasons, \na solution through choice of law is unlikely to prove satisfactory. \n \nB. Jurisdiction \n \nAt present, EU law (the Brussels I Regulation)\n43\n applies only when the defendant is \ndomiciled in an EU Member State. So a change here would not do much to help \ndefendants from the US or other non-European countries. However, there is a plan to \nextend its scope to cover at least some situations in which the defendant is domiciled \noutside the EU. If this happens, EU law may become the main focus of attention for \nfinding a solution to the problem of libel tourism. \n \n 1. EU law \n \nIf a change to EU law were contemplated, it would not be possible to find a solution \nthrough forum non conveniens, since its unpredictability makes it unacceptable to EU \nlawyers. Nor would a flexible jurisdictional rule be acceptable. Something clear-cut and \nprecise would have to be devised. As was said above, there are two provisions that could \napply to defamation proceedings. The first, Article 2(1), gives jurisdiction to the Member \n                                                 \n43\n Note 14*, above. \n 19 \nState in which the defendant is domiciled. Since this causes no problems, it does not have \nto be changed. \n \n The second is Article 5(3), which was discussed above.\n44\n This gives jurisdiction \nto the courts for the place where the \u201charmful event\u201d occurred. This should be retained, but \nit should be limited in the case of defamation. The following is a possibility:  \n \nIn the case of non-contractual obligations45 arising out of violations of privacy \nand rights relating to personality, including defamation,46 Article 5(3) shall \napply only if \u2013  \n \n(a)  the claimant is domiciled in the territory of the forum; or  \n \n(b)  the defendant has taken significant steps to make the offending \nmaterial available in the country of the forum and has targeted \nthat country more than any other. \n \nThis would apply in addition to jurisdiction based on the domicile of the defendant. \n \n 2. English law \n \nUnder English law, a solution could be found either through a change in the way in which \nforum non conveniens is applied, or by a change in the rules of jurisdiction. As regards \nforum non conveniens, the problem is that, if the claim is limited to a remedy for publication \n                                                 \n44\n See text to note 16.* \n45\n \u201cNon-contractual obligations\u201d is the term used in EU law. Its main component is tort, though it covers \nother matters as well. \n46\n This is the definition used in the Rome II Regulation for the purpose of excluding libel actions. See note \n9* above and the text thereto. \n 20 \nin England, the courts take into account only such publication.\n 47\n What is needed is some \nkind of single-publication rule for this purpose. This might be introduced through a change \nin case law: the present rule rests on decisions of the House of Lords and the Court of \nAppeal;\n48\n these could be overruled by the House of Lords. If legislation were to be adopted, \nthis could probably be done through an amendment to the Civil Procedure Rules, something \nthat would be much easier to do than to pass a statute. As regards a change in the rules of \njurisdiction, an amendment could be made to Practice Direction 6B, rule 3(1)(9),\n49\n perhaps \nalong the lines of the proposed amendment to Article 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation.\n50\n \n \nVII. CONCLUSIONS \n \nWhat has been said shows that a reasonable solution to the problem is possible. However, \nit is unlikely that legislation would be introduced either in England or in the European \nUnion unless there is a clearly felt need to do so. This is unlikely to be the case unless \nthose affected make out a case on the political level. \n                                                 \n47\n See text to notes 20\u201323*, above. \n48\n Berezovsky v.
