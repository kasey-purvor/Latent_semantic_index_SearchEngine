Introduction \nThere is extensive research documenting the gains from the diversification of domestic \nportfolios internationally. Grubel\u2019s (1968) study is accredited as the first to suggest that by \nincluding foreign securities, investors are able to achieve a lower variance in returns from the \ninternationally diversified portfolio because of the less than perfect correlations amongst \ndifferent stock markets around the world. Subsequent research by Solnik (1974) and more \nrecently by Driessen and Laeven (2007) support the view that diversifying internationally \nhelps in improving a portfolio\u2019s risk\/reward ratio. Although Jorion (1985) challenges the ex \npost gains reported by earlier studies, Eun and Resnick (1988) find that, even after controlling \nfor exchange risk, an internationally diversified portfolio significantly outperforms a portfolio \nthat is invested in only US securities. \n \nHowever, in spite of the overwhelming evidence on the gains from diversifying \ninternationally, Cooper and Kaplanis (1994) show that investors tend to invest a \ndisproportionately high share in domestic assets. In the literature, the tendency of investors to \ninvest a greater proportion of a portfolio in domestic securities is commonly known as home \nbias. More recently, Chan et al. (2005) investigate the factors which determine international \nasset allocations and find that mutual funds demonstrate foreign bias by underweighting and \noverweighting foreign markets. Further, Gelos and Wei (2005) show that international \ninvestment funds display wide variations in allocating weights to foreign markets based on \nthe level of a country\u2019s transparency. Evidence of home bias and foreign bias provided by \nprevious research thus far suggests that there are several direct and indirect barriers to \ninternational investments. These barriers arise, for instance, from discriminatory taxes, \ndifferent legal status accorded to foreign investors in terms of ownership restrictions, \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n3 \n \ndifferences in accounting and information disclosure standards and investor protection \nregulations, capital controls and transaction costs.\n1\n  \n \nThe consumption and portfolio choice model developed by Rowland (1999) shows that as \nthe magnitude of transaction cost increases, the rate of portfolio diversification decreases. \nThis implies that despite the well known benefits of international diversification, investors \nmay underweight those countries where the transaction costs are high. Of course, the \ninvestor\u2019s decision to allocate a greater proportion of capital to domestic securities may be \ninfluenced by home bias as they may feel that they are informationally disadvantaged while \ninvesting in foreign markets. However, if we control for home bias as well as for factors that \nhave been found important in international diversification literature, we should be able to \ndemonstrate whether transaction costs significantly influence the international equity \nportfolio allocations. By using a comprehensive dataset of bilateral cross-country foreign \nequity portfolio holdings and four different measures of transaction costs for 36 countries, \nthis paper examines whether different components of transaction cost significantly influence \ninternational investors\u2019 decisions to underweight or overweight country allocations.   \n \nThe role and importance of transaction cost in investments is not trivial. Keim and \nMadhavan (1995) suggest that transaction costs are important in determining investment \nperformance and may significantly diminish or possibly outweigh the expected value \ngenerated by an otherwise good investment strategy. Amihud and Mendelson\u2019s (1986) \nsuggest that assets with high transaction costs usually trade at a lower price relative to their \nexpected cash flows. Similarly, Green et al. (2000) using a long dataset on the UK stock \n                                                 \n1\n Bekaert and Harvey (2003) suggest that despite liberalization of financial markets, there are \nstill many barriers to investing internationally.  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n4 \n \nmarket suggest that the increase in transaction costs also generally increases market volatility, \nwhich is probably through the thin trading effect. They suggest that emerging markets must \nget the level of transaction cost right in order to influence their market volatility. Further, \nthey note that emerging markets should not only focus on stamp duty but must also \nconcentrate on other forms of transaction cost. De Roon et al. (2001) find that for US \ninvestors investing in emerging markets, the diversification benefits disappear when short \nselling and transaction costs are incorporated. Solnik and McLeavey (2004) note that the \nimpact of transaction costs is often disregarded in active global portfolio management and to \nthe extent diversification benefits may reduce portfolio risk; the incorporation of transaction \ncosts could reduce the expected returns. \n \nIn spite of the critical role of transaction cost acknowledged by previous studies, very few \nexamine its influence on international portfolio investment decisions. Chan et al. (2005) use \nthe transaction cost data of Elkins\/McSherry Co. in examining how mutual funds of 26 \ndeveloped and developing countries allocate their investment between domestic and foreign \nequity markets. However, they do not analyse the impact of each component (i.e., \ncommission, fees, and market impact) that make up the Elkins\/McSherry Co. transaction cost \nmeasure. Gelos and Wei (2005) merely control for transaction cost by using average turnover \nratio as a proxy in examining how their newly constructed measures of transparency affect \nthe investment choices of the emerging market equity funds. The apparent lack of research on \nthe impact of transaction costs on international portfolio allocations is mainly due to the \nunavailability of cross-border bilateral portfolio holdings data on a country by country basis. \nIn this research, we use bilateral country by country portfolio holdings data that have recently \nbeen made available by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and provide evidence of the \nextent to which portfolio allocation choices are influenced by transaction costs. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n5 \n \nOur study makes a number of important contributions to the existing literature. First, while \ncontrolling for the home bias phenomenon we examine the role of transaction costs in \ndemonstrating why certain countries receive higher or lower levels of foreign equity portfolio \nallocations than others. Second, unlike previous studies on international portfolio allocations, \nwe control for market microstructure effects by capturing the rate of information flow and \nindustrial diversity of the equity markets. Existing research ignores the role of real effective \nexchange rates on portfolio investment decisions. In this study, instead of using a bilateral \neffective exchange rate, we use a broad based trade weighted real effective exchange rate \nwhich is a much better measure of exchange rate risk. Third, we use an extensive dataset \ncomprising bilateral portfolio holdings for 36 developed and developing countries over a \nrecent time period of 2001 to 2006 with 562 bilateral cross-sectional units and 3290 \nobservations which enable us to comprehensively examine our research hypotheses. Finally, \nin contrast to most previous studies that use a cross-sectional approach, we test our \nhypotheses robustly by using random and fixed effect models within a panel-data framework. \n \nThe results show that all three direct measures of transaction cost (commission, fees and \nmarket impact) distinctly and significantly affect investment allocation choices, and that \ncountries with lower transaction costs seem to attract greater foreign equity portfolio \ninvestment. There are two important implications of this result. First, future research on \ninternational portfolio diversification cannot afford to ignore the role of transaction cost in \ncountry allocation decisions. Second, national policy makers should aim to reduce transaction \ncosts to attract higher levels of foreign equity portfolio investments.  \n \nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. The next section explains the theoretical \nframework that provides a basis for our empirical work. Section three explains the data, \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n6 \n \nvarious controlling variables and methodology used in this study. Section four presents and \ndiscusses the results of panel data analysis and section five concludes the paper. \n \n2. Barriers to bilateral cross country equity investments: Theoretical framework \nAn alternative approach to optimize the country allocation could be based on net equity \nreturns which largely depend on the trading frequency and whether trading costs are stable \nover time.\n2\n However, this is not a realistic assumption as the transaction costs would vary \nsignificantly over the sample period of six years (2001-2006) used in this paper. For example \nin the case of Malaysia, we find that there is a considerable temporal variation in transaction \ncosts and these appear to reduce over time.  \n \nWe use the theoretical framework of Cooper and Kaplanis (1986) which suggests that in \nthe presence of deadweight costs international investors do not hold the world market \nportfolio as is assumed in the International Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM). In the \nCooper and Kaplanis (1986) model, each investor is assumed to be a mean-variance risk-\naverse investor who is interested in maximizing returns for a given level of variance. \nTherefore, the optimization problem is described as:  \n \nsubject to \n  \n \n \n  \n \n                                                 \n2\n We thank the anonymous referee for this point. Chan et al. (2005) assume that transaction \ncosts remain stable over time. However, such an assumption is only valid where cross-\nsectional data analysis is used. We do not report data showing temporal variations in \ntransaction costs but these can be made available on request. \n  (1)  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n7 \n \nwhere wi is a column vector of foreign portfolio weights whereby the jth element corresponds \nto the weight of individual i\u2019s total wealth invested in risky assets of country j.

V is the variance\/covariance matrix of the gross (pre-cost, pre-tax) returns on the \nrisky assets with v being the constant variance and I is a unity column vector. The objective \nof the investor is to optimize equation (1) given the two constraints. Equation (1) can be \nmaximized using the Lagrange method: \n \n \nwhere h and k are the Lagrange multipliers. In order to maximize our objective function in \nequation (1), we need to set its derivative to zero and solve to get \n \n \n \nHence, the optimal portfolio for investor i is  \n \nwhere  \n \n \nNow that we have got the individual weights, the latter can be aggregated to arrive at the \nworld capital market equilibrium.

Let us consider a case where the \ncovariance matrix, V, is diagonal with all variances equal to s\n2\n and the deadweight cost of any \ncountry\/investor pair is denoted by c, except for the domestic country which is equal to zero. \nIn such a case, the portfolio holdings of investor i in country j are \n \n \nEquation (7) implies that the larger the deadweight cost, c, the greater should be the \ndeviation of actual portfolio holdings from the world market portfolio.

Data and methodology \nThis paper uses bilateral foreign equity portfolio investment holdings data, three direct \nmeasures of transaction cost, turnover ratio as an indirect measure of transaction cost, and a \nhost of controlling variables that have been shown to be relevant in international portfolio \nallocations by previous literature. The following section describes the data used in this study.  \n \n3.1. The dependent and independent variables \nFollowing Cooper and Kaplanis (1986), we model the portfolio weights as our dependent \nvariable revealed in the data.\n3\n The allocation weight of portfolio holdings of country i into \ncountry j is defined as \n \nwhere wijt is the weight of foreign equity investment (stock of holdings) from country i into \ncountry j for the year t and FPIijt is the actual foreign equity portfolio investment in USD \nmillion.\n4\n Bilateral investment holdings data are obtained from IMF website. In October 1997 \nthe IMF undertook a Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) of 29 participating \ncountries and began to annually report portfolio holdings on a bilateral country basis since \n                                                 \n3\n We also use a proxy for portfolio flows calculated by taking the first differences of portfolio \nholdings. We find that none of the regression specifications using flow proxy fit the model \nadequately as the maximum overall R\n2\n obtained is around 9%. Results are not reported here \nbut could be obtained from the authors on request. Further, our decision to use holdings data \nis justified since Fidora et al. (2007) suggest that the proxy portfolio flows constructed by \ntaking the first difference of the holdings data do not fully reflect actual portfolio flows as the \nchange may be caused by changes in valuation of  holdings over time.  \n \n4\n We also denominate the holdings in investor country\u2019s currency but as the results are \nvirtually unchanged we do not report these regression results. \n \n  (10)  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n11 \n \n2001.\n5\n The prime motive of the survey is to have better understanding of the global \nasymmetries in the reported balance of payment data, particularly those in portfolio \ninvestments. All participating countries are required to report a breakdown of their stock of \nportfolio investments, including portfolio equity investment holdings by the country of \nresidency of the non-resident issuer. The IMF website provides detailed data on a country by \ncountry basis. Although data are available from 1997, complete data for all countries are \navailable only from 2001 onwards. Since in the majority of cases, investments originate from \ndeveloped countries, we consider portfolio weights from the point of view of investors based \nin developed countries such as the US. Fidora et al. (2007), who also use the same dataset for \nhome bias issues, note that investment from developing countries into developed countries is \nalmost negligible and mostly not reported by IMF. Further, the selection of 16 investor \ncountries and 36 target countries is dictated by data availability. The trading cost data for 36 \ncountries we use in this study are handpicked from Standard and Poor\u2019s Global Stock \nMarkets Factbook.\n6\n  \n \nIn our analysis, the independent variables are the four different measures of transaction \ncost in country j at time t. This includes three measures of trading cost maintained by \nElkins\/McSherry (E\/M) and reported in the Standard and Poor\u2019s Global Stock Markets \nFactbook. E\/M analyzes trading costs for 150 global institutions such as pension funds, \n                                                 \n5\n The survey includes the financial market participants, the primary end-investors (e.g. banks, \nsecurity dealers, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, non financial \ncorporations, households), and primary custodians, who hold or manage securities on behalf \nof others. Some caveats deserve mention. Any investment below USD 500,000 is not \nreported. Also, some data may not be reported by a country due to confidentiality reasons. \n \n6\n Following Fidora et al. (2007), we also do not include offshore financial centres \n(Luxembourg and others) as recipient countries because of third-country holdings and round-\ntripping issues. For example, for the year 2003 the total holding reported by German \ninvestors alone in Luxembourg was USD 152 billion whereas Luxembourg\u2019s total market \ncapitalization was less than USD 40 million. \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n12 \n \ninvestment managers, banks and brokers and their measures comprise three components. The \nfirst is the average commission paid (TC1). According to Solnik and McLeavey (2004) this \nrepresents commission paid to the brokers for allowing access to brokerage services and \nresearch resources. The second is the average fee (TC2) which includes costs incurred for \nobtaining additional services such as the post-trade settlement. It is worth mentioning that for \nthe UK, the buying fee is significantly higher because of the stamp duty. We have taken \naverage of buy and sell costs as investors pay more for buying but are compensated by paying \nsignificantly less for selling.  \n \nThe third measure is the average cost of market impact (TC3). The Standard and Poor\u2019s \nGlobal Stock Markets Factbook defines market impact as the difference between the price at \nwhich a trade is executed and the average of the stock\u2019s high, low, opening and closing prices \nduring the trade. More precisely, it is the average cost of trade versus the average price. \nMarket impact is hence defined as the difference between the actual execution cost and the \nprice that would have been availed had the investor not been involved in the trading. All three \ncosts are denominated in basis points. Finally, following previous literature, we use turnover \nratio (TC4) as a proxy measure of transaction cost. The turnover ratio is the average value \ntraded divided by average market capitalization. This measure indicates the relative level of \nliquidity and, following Amihud and Mendelson (1986), the turnover ratio is expected to be \nnegatively related to transaction costs. The turnover data have been collected from annual \nissues of Standard and Poor\u2019s Global Stock Markets Factbook. \n \n \n \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n13 \n \n3.2. Control variables \nWe have used a number of control variables.\n7\n The first is to control for the home bias \nphenomenon. French and Porteba (1991), and more recently Karlsson and Nord\u00e9n (2007), \nshow that despite the risk reduction benefits that foreign securities offer, investors tend to \noverweight domestic securities.  Chan et al. (2005) note that if foreign investors exhibit home \nbias and overweight their domestic market, the allocation to foreign markets would be \ndisproportionately lower. Following Fidora et al. (2007), we construct the measure of \nbilateral home bias (HBIASijt) as follows:  \n \n \nwhere HBIASijt is bilateral home bias observed by the host or investor country i for country j \nat time t.  BWTjt is defined as the benchmark weight and is computed as  \n \n \nwhere MCjt is the market capitalization of the issuer j country at time t.  \n \nThe second control variable we use is the investor protection measure. Aggarwal et al. \n(2005) suggest that the US funds tend to invest in open market economies where stronger \nshareholders\u2019 rights and legal frameworks are present. We use the investor profile measure \nprovided by the ICRG Political Risk Services Group as a proxy for the quality of investor \n                                                 \n7\n However, we do not include withholding taxes following French and Poterba (1991) who \nshow that there is no significant relationship between taxes and international investment.  \n \n  (11)  \n  (12)  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n14 \n \nprotection available in each country. The investor profile measure is constructed on a scale of \n0 to 12 and reflects government\u2019s attitude towards inward investment. The investor profile \nmeasure is further divided into three sub-components: (i) contract viability or risk of \nexpropriation, (ii) payment delays, and (iii) repatriation of profits. Each subcomponent is \nscored on a scale of 0 to 4 where 4 reflects a very low potential risk. This variable is expected \nto be positively related to portfolio weights as investors would prefer investing in those \ncountries which provide better investor protection. La Porta et al. (1998) show that the \nEnglish common law system provides better legal protection to shareholders compared to the \nGerman and French civil law systems. As an additional measure of investor protection, we \nuse a legal dummy which takes a value of 1 for common law countries and 0 otherwise. \n \nFurther, we include two variables to control for economic development and economic \ngrowth. In order to control for the level of economic development we use the log value of per \ncapita GDP denominated in USD. For economic growth, we use the GDP growth rate. Both \nvariables are expected to show a positive relationship since investors should prefer to invest \nin countries that demonstrate higher economic development and growth. Data for both \nvariables are obtained from world development indicator (WDI) of the World Bank. \n \nA commonly used proxy in the previous literature is the capital control intensity used by \nEdison and Warnok (2003). This measure is constructed by taking a ratio of market \ncapitalization represented by S&P\/IFC Investable Indices to the market capitalization of \nS&P\/IFC Global Indices. This variable ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating completely open \nmarkets to foreign investors. Since these indices are mostly available for developing \ncountries in the Standard and Poor\u2019s Global Stock Markets Factbook and most developed \nmarkets have open economies, the ratios have been set to 1 for all developed countries. The \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n15 \n \nequity market openness variable also measures the time variation in the financial \nliberalization process and is expected to have a positive sign.\n8\n \n \nFollowing Dahlquist et al. (2003), since only a small portion of the market capitalization \nin most countries may be available to international investors, we use an additional proxy for \ncapital control which is calculated as a percentage of closely held shares of the total market \ncapitalization.  This measure is expected to capture the prevalence of closely held firms and \nexpected to carry a negative coefficient. \n \nChan et al. (2005) show that the level of stock market development affects international \nportfolio investments. We use the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP as a measure of \nstock market development obtained from WDI. Additionally, we use cross-sectional standard \ndeviation of stock returns (based on monthly data) for each country to control for market \nmicro-structure effects. Ross (1989) models cross-sectional standard deviation as a direct \nmeasure for the rate of information flow which also reflects the diversity of the industrial \nsector. A low cross-sectional standard deviation would suggest that the economy is not well \ndeveloped and industries represented on its stock market are not diversified. Following \nequation (4) in section 2, we expect this variable to be negatively correlated to international \nportfolio investments.  We also use an emerging market dummy to further control for the \nlevel of stock market development since it is well known that emerging markets are not as \nwell developed as stock markets in developed countries.  \n \nForeign investors are generally concerned about exchange rate movements since they \ndirectly affect returns measured in domestic currencies. Therefore, foreign investors require a \n                                                 \n8\n  See De Jong and Roon (2005), Panchenko and Wu (2009) and Lagoarde-Segot (2009) \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n16 \n \ncurrency risk premium for bearing systematic risk which they cannot diversify. In order to \ncontrol for exchange rate risk, we use a three year moving average standard deviation of the \ntrade weighted Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) sourced from the Bank of International \nSettlement (BIS).  \n \nCarrieri et al. (2006) note that it is more appealing to use REER than the nominal \nexchange rate because inflation rates are generally non-random and hence the nominal \nexchange rate may not reflect the true effect of exchange rate risk. Since the REER measure \nis based on the combined effect of changes in the inflation differential and changes in \nnominal currency value, it is a better measure because it captures the true effect of exchange \nrate risk arising from deviations from the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). Further, Carrieri et \nal. (2006) provide evidence that the nominal exchange rate index may be confounded with \nother information and may not capture deviations from PPP or other factors.  Hence, by using \nthe REER we are able to adjust the inflation rate differentials.\n9\n The REER is calculated by \nadjusting the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) for the relative consumer prices levels. \nThe BIS REER basket includes 52 economies, including the emerging countries. \n \nAll control variables discussed so far are country specific variables. It is highly likely that \ninternational portfolio investments may be influenced by long term bilateral relationship, \ngeographic proximity and market familiarity. In order to control for these factors, we employ \na language dummy which takes the value of 1 if a pair country shares a common language. \nSimilarly, we also add the log of the distance between capital cities of pair countries. Both \nthese variables are obtained from the NBER website and have been used previously by \n                                                 \n9\n Akram et al. (2009) demonstrate numerous economically significant violations of the law of \none price. Although the use of REER could be justified in the light of the existing studies, we \nalso use NEER calculated as the geometric weighted average of a basket of bilateral \nexchange rates. However, our results remain unchanged.  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n17 \n \nSubramanian and Wei (2007). The bilateral trade data are obtained from the Bilateral Trade \nStatistics of IMF and calculated by taking the log of total exports and imports of the pair \ncountry. The bilateral measure explained above captures the informational asymmetries that \nmight exist between foreign and domestic investors. This may also help in predicting the \nprobability of information flow as well as measuring the barriers that foreign investors \nencounter in seeking information overseas.  \n \nIt is widely known that greater portfolio diversification is achieved by adding foreign \nsecurities that have a lower return correlation with the returns from home securities (Solnik, \n1974). Thus to control for diversification potential between the pair countries, we use a \ncorrelation coefficient based on the six years\u2019 monthly return data. We expect that lower \ncorrelations should positively influence international portfolio investments and vice versa. \nThe final set of control variables we include are historical returns and country risk. We \ncalculate the three year moving average of historical returns as it has been shown that \ninvestors prefer to invest in countries with higher historical returns. This investor tendency is \ncommonly referred to in the literature as the return chasing hypothesis or feedback hypothesis \n(see Bohn and Tesar, 1996; Asem, 2009). We also include the composite country rating \nproduced by the PRS group, popularly known as the  International Country Risk Guide \n(ICRG) rating which comprises 22 variables in three subcategories of risk: political, financial, \nand economic. A separate index is created for each of the subcategories. The Political Risk \nindex is based on 100 points, Financial Risk index on 50 points, and Economic Risk index on \n50 points. The aggregate country risk is computed by multiplying the aggregate 200 points by \n0.5. \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n18 \n \nIt is possible that our model may suffer from over-correction. For instance, the inclusion \nof bilateral variables and the equity market openness along with the bilateral home bias \nmeasure may cause the model to over-correct in controlling the bilateral and equity market \nopenness as these variables are modelled against home bias in existing studies (see Fidora et \nal. 2007). When we run a simple regression to explain home bias using bilateral familiarity \nvariables (trade, distance, language and correlation) and equity market openness, we find that \nall variables are statistically significant with an adjusted R\n2\n of 20%.\n10\n This shows that home \nbias captures a significant effect of these variables. In order to address this issue we follow \nthe approach of Fama and French (1993) and orthogonalize these five variables (trade, \ndistance, language, correlation and equity market openness) by deducting the fitted value \nfrom the home bias measure. This approach does not affect the coefficient and test-statistic \nfor home bias and neither does it affect the relationship of transaction cost measures on any \nof the bilateral and equity openness variables. It simply orthogonalizes the effect of the \nbilateral variables from the home bias measure resolving the over-correction problem.  \nFurther, La Porta et al. (1998) suggest that investor protection is a major determinant of stock \nmarket development. As such, we run a simple regression of investor protection on stock \nmarket development and find that the coefficient for investor protection is 11.02 with a test-\nstatistic of 12.93, confirming the strong effect of investor protection on stock market \ndevelopment. Hence we orthogonalize the effect of investor protection from the stock market \ndevelopment measure.  \n \n3.3. Methodology \nOur data include bilateral portfolio investments for 36 recipient countries and 16 investor \ncountries over a period of six years (2001-2006)  providing us with a total of 562 cross-\n                                                 \n10\n The coefficients and their test-statistic are not reported here to save space but can be \nobtained from the authors on request. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n19 \n \nsection units and a total of 3290 observations. Not every regression uses all observations as \nfor a few countries some variables are not available. For example, no bilateral trade data are \navailable for Taiwan. Also, no transaction cost data are available for China, Poland and \nRussia.  \n \nGiven the wide cross-sectional differences and temporal variations, we employ panel data \nregression models using random and fixed effect estimations across different specifications. \nSince our analysis includes a number of dummies and rarely changing variables, this leaves \nus with little choice but to use the random effect model in most of our specifications. In our \nrandom effect models, although we are unable to control time invariant pair country effects, \nwe are able to include all observed country specific and bilateral controls and the time \ndummies. Since the random effect model utilizes both \u2018within\u2019 and \u2018between\u2019 country \nvariations, it is more efficient than the fixed effect model. However, since all our key \nvariables are time varying, we also use the fixed effect model to control for unit specific \neffects. \n \n4. Empirical findings \nWe first present the univariate average values of our dependent and independent variables. \nAlthough not as robust as panel regressions, univariate analysis does provide useful \ninformation.   \n \n4.1. Statistics on portfolio weights and transaction costs \nTable 1 presents the averages of foreign equity portfolio investment and the transaction \ncosts (in basis points) for all countries (j) for the entire sample period 2001-2006. It is worth \nnoting from the figures in the second column that Peru receives the lowest average foreign \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n20 \n \nequity portfolio allocation (0.02%), whereas the US receives the highest portfolio \ninvestments (37.76%).\n11\n In terms of the top ten ranking, most countries are developed \ncountries (US, UK, Switzerland, Sweden, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, Finland and \nCanada). Eight out of the ten countries that received lowest international portfolio allocation \nare developing countries (Argentina, Chile, Czech Republic, Malaysia, Peru, Philippines, \nThailand and Turkey).  \n \n(Insert Table \u201c1\u201d here) \n \nColumns 3, 4 and 5 of Table 2 show the average of various components of transaction \ncosts (i.e., commission, fees and market impact cost, respectively). Column 6 shows the total \ntransaction costs (sum of commission, fees and market impact cost) and column 7 provides \nthe average turnover ratio for each country (j). In terms of total cost (column 6), it is evident \nthat Japan has the lowest total transaction cost followed by US, Austria, Belgium, Canada, \nAustralia, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland. Not surprisingly, all of these \ncountries are developed countries, although when turnover ratios are compared, the order \nalters a little. Developed countries still dominate the rankings with the exception of Korea, \nTaiwan and India. The univariate analysis provides prima facie evidence that generally lower \ntransaction costs are associated with higher foreign portfolio allocations.  \n \nTable 2 shows the correlation coefficients between different components of transaction \ncosts. Except for TC1 (commission) and TC2 (fees) that are somewhat correlated (0.40), \nother combinations have lower or negative correlations. Also, as expected, the turnover ratio \n                                                 \n11\n Despite lower market capitalization of their equity markets, UK, France and Germany rank \nhigher than Japan in terms of portfolio allocation for our sample period. We find that this is \non account of home bias and other factors. For example, Japan has the highest home bias \n(1.47) compared to 0.49, 0.42 and 0.51 for France, Germany and UK respectively.  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n21 \n \nis negatively correlated with all other measures of transaction cost. This suggests that \nmulticollinearity is not a significant problem among the various measures of transaction \ncosts.  \n(Insert Table \u201c2\u201d here) \n \n4.2. Regression analysis  \nThe univariate analysis of the summary statistics presented in previous sub-sections \nprovides a good indication that countries with relatively lower transaction costs seem to \nattract higher equity portfolio allocation. To confirm this, we employ a number of regressions \nby including different variables that could potentially explain variations in portfolio \nallocations.\n12\n All significant coefficients are shown with asterisks and the test-statistics are \nshown in parenthesis. Regression specification (13) includes the home bias (HBIAS) variable \nbesides each of the different components of transaction cost (TC1, TC2, TC3 and TC4) as \nindependent variables. The results of the regression are presented in Table 3. \n \n \nAs expected HBIAS is highly significant and bears the expected negative sign. \nEstimations show that a 1% increase in home bias decreases bilateral portfolio holdings by \nnearly 1%. This finding is consistent with evidence provided by previous studies and \nconfirms the existence of home bias in international portfolio allocations. However, after \ncontrolling for the home bias, all transaction cost measures are highly significant at the 5% \nlevel of significance.  \n                                                 \n12\n We also run regressions using bilateral 16 by 16 source-host countries (i.e. excluding the \nemerging markets) and find that our results are robust. To save space we do not report the \nresults here but these can be obtained from the authors on request. \n (13)  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n22 \n \n \n(Insert Table \u201c3\u201d here) \n \nThe results presented in Table 3, however, may be biased since specification (13) excludes \nmacroeconomic, institutional and bilateral control variables. Thus in regression (14), we \ninclude macroeconomic, institutional and bilateral variables, and time dummies.  \n \n \nThe results in Table 4 show that the coefficient for HBIAS is still negative and statistically \nsignificant. Although the magnitude of transaction cost coefficients is somewhat reduced, \nthey remain statistically significant. The changes in magnitude of the coefficients of \ntransaction cost measures are not surprising since inclusion of the control variables and time \ndummies mitigates any bias inherent in regression (13). \n \n(Insert Table \u201c4\u201d here) \n    \n   Next we run a number of different specifications of the model to ensure that our estimates \nare robust. The outputs of different specifications of the model are shown in Table 5. We first \ndiscuss the results of the transaction cost measures followed by the discussion about the \nimpact of control variables. \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n(14)  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n23 \n \n4.3. All in one  \nAs multicollinearity amongst the different transaction cost measures is not a significant \nproblem, we include all four transaction cost variables in a single regression and jointly \nestimate their significance via the following regression: \n \n \nThe findings reported in Table 5 (specification 15) show that not only are the coefficients \nfor transaction cost measures highly significant, but they also carry expected signs. Also the \nmodel yields an improved R\n2\n of 83%. This suggests that each transaction cost measure has a \ndistinct and statistically significant influence on foreign portfolio allocations. \n \n(Insert Table \u201c5\u201d here) \n \n4.4. Free float home bias \nAs discussed earlier, the home bias (HBIAS) variable that we use is based on the \nassumptions that all countries follow an open market policy allowing free entry and exit of \nforeign investors. However, despite vigorously pursuing the liberalization of financial \nmarkets, many emerging markets in developing countries have regulations that impede the \nfree inflow and outflow of portfolio investments. In order to address this issue we include two \nadditional variables which could potentially control for this deficiency. The first is the equity \nmarket openness and the second is the extent of the existence of closely held firms. In order \nto further substantiate the issue of free float securities, we construct a free float HBIAS \nmeasure using the S&P IFC\u2019s freely investable market value index. However, a caveat is \nworth noting here. The HBIAS measure is only available for the markets in developing \n (15)  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n24 \n \ncountries and therefore in our analysis we assume that developed markets are completely \nopen for foreign investors. However, even if this is not the case for some developed \ncountries, the closely held variable included in our model should be able to capture the effects \nof investment restrictions, if any. We run the regression specified in equation (16) with a \nfreely floated home bias (F_HBIAS) variable. The regression outputs are reported in Table 5 \n(Specification 16). \n \n \nResults suggest that the magnitude of the F_HBIAS coefficient is slightly lower than in \nspecification 15. However, it is still statistically significant. The transaction cost coefficients \nremain highly significant without any material change in their estimated coefficients except \nfor liquidity measure (TC4). \n \n4.5. Unit specific effect and reverse causality \nOur regression coefficients may still be suspected of bias, since it is possible that each \ncountry may have its individual effect through the time invariant variables, and also due to \ntime invariant pair country bilateral effects, such as common colonization history, special \nbilateral treaty, favourite partner nation status, etc. If this is the case then the unobserved time \ninvariant variables may be correlated with the regressors and the estimates may be biased. \nWe use the fixed effect model to address this issue. As discussed earlier, that although the \nfixed effect model is not as efficient as the random effect model, it does account for all \ncountry specific and bilateral cross-country time invariant effects. As our transaction cost and \nmost of the other control variables have a time dimension, we are able to employ the fixed \n \n \n \n(16)  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n25 \n \neffect model using only the time variant variables. We run regression specification 17 using a \nfixed effect model.  \n \n \nThe results reported in Table 5 (Specification 17) show that the explanatory power of the \nmodel is somewhat reduced since all time invariant variables are not used. However, the \nreported goodness-of-fit of the fixed effect model is explained by the \u2018within transformation\u2019 \nof the independent variables and cannot be interpreted in the usual way (see Wooldridge, \n2003). All key variables, i.e., commission, fees, and market impact cost variables, remain \nstatistically significant without any major change in either their statistical significance or \nsigns.  \n \nIn our regressions, reverse causality may also be a potential problem. To overcome this, \nwe use one year lagged value of all four transaction cost measures in regression 18.  \n \n \nAs can be observed from the estimates in Table 5 (Specification 18), the regression \ncoefficients of the lagged values of transaction costs remain statistically significant. The \nmagnitude of the estimates does change as they reflect the lagged effect rather than the level. \nHowever, despite using lagged values, the transaction cost measures remain statistically \nsignificant, confirming that the transaction cost variables used in our estimations do not \nappear to suffer from reverse causality problems.  \n \n (17)  \n (18)  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n26 \n \n4.6. Major financial centres \nWe consider the possibility of international investors buying depositary receipts listed in \nmajor financial centres instead of investing directly in shares trading in the foreign equity \nmarkets. International investors may be tempted to use major financial centres because of the \nlower transaction costs (Aggarwal et al. 2007). If this is the case then our transaction cost \nestimates may be affected because our sample includes US, UK and Japan which are major \nfinancial centres where depositary receipts are listed and actively traded. In order to address \nthis issue, we exclude US, UK and Japan as investor countries from the sample and run the \nfollowing specification (19).  \n \n \nAs seen in Table 5 (Specification 19), despite excluding US, UK and Japan, the \ncoefficients of all transaction cost measures remain highly significant. This confirms that \neven after removing the effects of the major financial centres, transaction costs do seem to \nmatter in the international portfolio allocations. \n \n4.7. Practical significance \nIn order to explain the practical importance of transaction costs in attracting international \nportfolio investments, we generate a dummy for an arbitrarily chosen country, Portugal, and \nexamine its interaction with commission cost (TC1) via the following specification: \n \n \n \n \n \n(19)  \n (20)  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n27 \n \nThe regression results in Table 5 (Specification 20) show that the coefficient of TC1 for \nPortugal is -5.47 [i.e. (-0.89) + (-4.58)]. This indicates that on average a 1% decrease in \ntransaction cost could lead to a 5.47% increase in Portugal\u2019s weightings in the international \nportfolio. This illustrates that the estimated effects of transaction costs demonstrated in this \npaper are not trivial. \n \n4.8. Nominal effective exchange rate \nAs discussed earlier, we also test the model by including a volatility measure based on the \nnominal effective exchange rate (NEER) obtained from BIS and run the following \nspecification.  \n \n \nAs shown in Table 5 (specification 21) the coefficients of transaction costs remain \nstatistically significant. This indicates that the effect of transaction costs on portfolio \nallocations remains unchanged irrespective of the choice of exchange rate volatility measure. \n \n4.9. Investor country\u2019s perspective  \nHitherto the specifications used have included all investor countries\u2019 bilateral foreign \nequity portfolio holdings data. In specification 22, we examine year by year regression for \neach investor country. Since we run 96 regressions (16 countries \u00d7 six years), it is practically \nnot feasible to report all 384 coefficients (96 \u00d7 four transaction cost measures). Instead we \nprovide a summary of regression results in table 6 which shows the number of countries for \nwhich we find TC1-TC4 significant at 1%, 5% and 10% significance levels.\n13\n \n                                                 \n13\n We thank the anonymous referee for this suggestion. \n (21)  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n28 \n \n \nThe results in Table 6 show that out of the total number of regressions, TC1 is highly \nsignificant in 98% cases, TC2 in 79%, TC3 in 90% and TC4 in 88% cases. We relate this \nresult to our univariate analysis. The lower percentage of cases for TC2 may be attributed to \nits relatively lower share in the total transaction costs. TC1 (commission) and TC3 (market \nimpact) constitute more than 90% of the trading costs for all countries, except for the UK, \nPhilippines, Taiwan and Greece. This suggests that even from an individual investor \ncountry\u2019s perspective, transaction costs remain a very important factor for international \ninvestments.  \n \n(Insert Table \u201c6\u201d here) \n \n4.10. Control variables \nMost of the control variables have expected and consistent signs in the different \nspecifications except for GDP growth and country risk. As seen from the reported statistics in \nTable 6, both investor protection measures are significant and bear expected signs \nconsistently in all regressions. The GDP growth, although significant in most cases, is not \nconsistent in terms of expected signs which may suggest that investors may be more \nconcerned with the level of economic development captured by GDP per capita which is \nhighly significant and generally consistent across all specifications in terms of its expected \nsigns. Further, Equity market openness and Closely held firm variables are also significant \nand carry the expected signs indicating that investors tend to underweight those countries \nwhich have high restrictions on foreign investment and where ownership is not dispersed.  \n \n (22)  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n29 \n \nAs far as the three equity market related variables, i.e., Stock market development, Equity \nmarket volatility and Exchange rate volatility are concerned, they carry expected signs and \nare highly significant across all specifications, except specification 18 where equity market \nvolatility is insignificant. The results make sense since they indicate that foreign investors are \nkeen to invest in countries where stock markets are large, volatility of equity returns is lower \nand where there is less uncertainty with regard to exchange rates. Following Ross\u2019s (1989) \nmodel, the significance of cross-sectional standard deviation (equity market volatility) \nillustrates that investors prefer countries with a well developed market microstructure and \nwhere the rate of information flow and industrial diversity of the equity market are high.  \n \nAs expected, the Emerging market dummy coefficient is negative and statistically \nsignificant in all specifications confirming that stock market development is indeed a key \nfactor influencing the international portfolio allocations. Bilateral trade too is highly \nsignificant in all regressions. Good trade relations between countries seem to positively \ninfluence the international portfolio investments. This is also consistent with evidence \nprovided by Chan et al. (2005) who report that bilateral trade plays a significant part in \nportfolio allocation choice. Finally, we find the coefficients on common language, distance \nhistorical return and equity return correlation to be consistent and carrying expected signs. \nWe find that the broad measure of country risk either changes signs or becomes insignificant \nunder different specifications. Similar results of the insignificance or inconsistencies of some \nof the control variables are also reported by previous studies when modelling foreign \nportfolio investments (see Gelos and Wei, 2005).  \n \nOverall, the dominance of the market specific variables such as stock market development, \nequity market volatility, exchange rate volatility, emerging market dummy and bilateral \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n30 \n \ninformation asymmetry variables shows that investors prefer to invest in markets which are \nwell developed and have lower transactions costs. \n \n4.11. Relative measure of transaction cost and volatility measures \nWe further discuss the importance of our transaction cost measures relative to volatility \nmeasures. We follow two methods to identify the relative importance. Following Gelos and \nWei (2005), the first method we use is to study the relative size of adjusted R\n2\n. We run two \nregressions. In the first regression, we include only four transaction cost proxies and in the \nsecond, we include only volatility measures. The results in Table 7 show that the adjusted R\n2\n \nof the first regression is 45% and 7% for the second regression. The results confirm that \ntransaction cost measures are more important compared to volatility measures.  \n \nIn order to ensure the robustness of the results reported in Panel A, we run an OLS \nregression (23), where  are the volatility measures. \n \n \nWe report the standardized beta (ranked highest to lowest) of the transaction cost and \nvolatility measures in panel 2 of Table 7. Once again standardized betas for all four \ntransaction cost measures are much larger relative to the volatility measures. \n \n5. Summary and concluding remarks \n \nIn spite of the critical role of transaction cost, there is relatively much less research on its \ninfluence on international equity portfolio investment decisions. In this study, we use hand \ncollected data on different components of transaction cost (commission, fees and market \n (23)  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n31 \n \nimpact) and country by country portfolio investment holdings for 36 countries over the 2001-\n2006 period and examine whether portfolio allocation choices are influenced by levels of \ntransaction costs. \n \nUsing the random and fixed effect models, and after controlling for a host of other \nvariables including a measure that captures the home bias effect, we find a robust and \nsignificant impact of transaction cost on international equity portfolio investments. The \nresults show that the three direct measures of transaction cost and in particular commission \nand market impact, which make up a significant proportion of transaction cost in most \ncountries, have a distinct and statistically significant impact on investment allocation choices. \nThe findings show that countries with lower transaction costs seem to attract greater foreign \nequity portfolio investments.  \n \nThere are two important implications of our results. First, future research on international \nportfolio diversification cannot afford to ignore the role of transaction cost in country \nallocation decisions. Second, policy makers, especially in developing countries, should \nimplement measures to reduce transaction costs in order to attract higher levels of foreign \nequity portfolio investments.  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n32 \n \nReferences \nAggarwal, R., Dahiya, S., Klapper, L., 2007.
