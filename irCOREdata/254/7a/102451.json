INTRODUCTION\nThe case of (2; 2)-separation was introduced by Sagalovich in the\ncontext of automata: two such systems transiting simultaneously from\nstate a to a0 and from b to b0, respectively, should be forbidden to pass\nthrough a common intermediate state. He has written a long series of\npapers since the 1960s, a fairly recent survey can be found in [1]. States\nare simply binary n-tuples and only shortest paths are allowed during\ntransitions; in other words, the only \u201cmoves\u201d permitted while transiting\nfrom a to a0 are complementing the d(a; a0) bits where a and a0 differ\n(one at a time). Clearly, if the separation property holds, no two such\nminimal-length paths between a and a0, and b and b0 will intersect.\nThe design of self-checking asynchronous network has been a chal-\nlenging problem. Friedman et al. [2] have shown that some of the uni-\ncode single-transition-time asynchronous state assignments correspond\nto (2; 2)-separating systems.\nSeparating partition systems have been studied by Friedman\nand Koml\u00f3s [3]. These authors used information theory to derive\nnonexistence bounds for separating partition systems in two special\ncases\u2014systems of perfect hash functions and (i; j)-separating\nsystems.\nThe problem of perfect hash functions was generalized by K\u00f6rner\nand Simonyi [4]. They improve on earlier results for (i; j)-separating\nsystems of partitions and give new treatment of the problem about\nthe minimum number of partitions in any (i; j)-separating partition\nsystems for a set of given size.\nThe digitalization of our world expanded our concept of wa-\ntermarking to include immaterial, digital impressions for use in\nauthenticating ownership claims and protecting proprietary interests.\nA digital watermark is a signal or pattern inserted into a digital\n\u201cdocument\u201d (e.g., text, graphics, multimedia presentations). Digital\nfingerprints are characteristics of an object in a digital format that tend\nto distinguish it from other similar objects. Codes were introduced in\n[5] (see also [6]) as a method of \u201cdigital fingerprinting\u201d which prevents\na coalition of a given size from forging a copy with no member of the\ncoalition being caught.\nThe outline of the correspondence is as follows. Definitions and\nbasic results are presented in Section II. We then derive sufficient con-\nditions on the code distances to insure separation.

Finally, we present asymptotic results and a\ntable of rates.\nII. DEFINITIONS AND BASIC RESULTS\nWe use the notation of [6] for fingerprinting issues and of [7] for\ncodes and Hadamard matrices.\nFor any positive real number xwe shall denote by bxc its integer part\nand by dxe the smallest integer at least equal to x. A set \u0000 \u0012 GF (q)n\nis called an (n; M; d)-code if j\u0000j = M and the minimum Hamming\ndistance between two of its elements (codewords) is d. Suppose C \u0012 \u0000.\nFor any position i define the projection Pi(C) = faija 2 Cg, and the\nfeasible set of C by\nF (C) = fx 2 GF (q)n: 8 i; xi 2 Pi(C)g:\nThe feasible set F (C) represents the set of all possible n-tuples (de-\nscendants) that could be produced by the coalition C by comparing the\ncodewords they jointly hold. Observe that C \u0012 F (C) for all C, and\nF (C) = C if jCj = 1.\nWe denote by C[n; k; d1]q (or simply C[n; k]q when d1 is irrele-\nvant) a linear code of length n, dimension k over GF (q) and minimum\ndistance d1. By m1 we denote the maximum distance of a code. In the\nnonlinear case, (n; M)q is a code of length n with M codewords. The\nsubscript is omitted in the binary case. The rate of C is defined as\nR(C) = R = n\u00001 logq jCj. We refer to [7] for all undefined notions\non codes.\nDefinition 1: We say that a code C is (t; t0)-separating if, for any\npair (T; T 0) of disjoint subsets of C where jT j = t and jT 0j = t0, the\nfeasible sets are disjoint, i.e., F (T ) \\ F (T 0) = ;.\nIn earlier works on watermarking, (t; t)-separating codes have been\ncalled t-partially identifying codes [8] or t-secure frameproof [9], [6].\nThe current terminology is older though [1].\nDefinition 2: A (t; t0)-configuration is a pair (T; T 0) of disjoint\nvector sets of sizes t and t0, respectively. We say that (T; T 0) is sep-\narated if F (T ) \\ F (T 0) = ;, and otherwise it is nonseparated. A\n(t; t0)-NSC is a nonseparated (t; t0)-configuration.\nA code is (t; t0)-separating if and only if it contains no (t; t0)-NSC.\nObviously, if C is (t; t0)-separating, then it is also (t0; t)-separating,\nand (t000; t00)-separating for all t000 \u0014 t and all t00 \u0014 t0.\nIII. BOUNDS BASED ON DISTANCES\nProposition 1: If C is a linear, binary (2; 2)-separating code of di-\nmension k, then m1 < n \u0000 2(k \u0000 2).\nProof: If k \u0014 1, the result is trivial. For k = 2, it only says that\nthe all-one codeword 1 cannot be in the code C , lest (0; 1; c; c + 1)\nform a (2; 2)-NSC for c 2 Cnf0; 1g.\nWe then turn to the case k \u0015 3. We shall prove that if n \u0000m1 \u0014\n2(k \u0000 2), then C cannot be (2; 2)-separating. Consider a codeword\nc of maximum weight. Since the code is linear, for every set of k \u0000 2\ncoordinate positions, there exist at least three nonzero codewords which\nare zero on these positions, and thus at least one which is not c. In\nparticular, there is a nonzero codeword a which is zero on half the\npositions not in the support of c, and one b which is zero on the other\nhalf. Thus, (0; c; a; b) is a (2; 2)-NSC.\n0018-9448\/02$17.00 \u00a9 2002 IEEE\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY, VOL. 48, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 2002 2607\nLet c0; c; a; b be distinct vectors such that (c0; c; a; b) is a (2; 2)-\nNSC. From this assumption, we will derive some statements on the\nminimum and maximum weights of any code which is not (2; 2)-sep-\narating. This will give a sufficient condition for a code to be (2; 2)-sep-\narating in Theorem 1. The binary linear case of Theorem 1 has previ-\nously been stated by Sagalovich [1]. We now make some preliminary\nobservations and then prove a lemma.\nRemark 1: If \u0019: GF (q)n ! GF (q)n is an automorphism, then\n(T; T 0) is a (t; t0)-NSC if and only if (\u0019(T ); \u0019(T 0)) is a (t; t0)-NSC.\nRemark 2: If (T; T 0) is a (t; t0)-NSC, then so is (T + c; T 0 + c)\nfor any c 2 GF (q)n. If T + c; T 0 + c \u001a C , then T; T 0 \u001a C 0 for\nsome code C 0 equivalent to C . If C is linear and T; T 0 \u001a C , then\nT + c; T 0 + c \u001a C .\nBy Remark 2, we can assume that c0 = 0.\nWe write\nc =(c1; c2; . . . ; cn)\na =(a1; a2; . . . ; an)\nb =(b1; b2; . . . ; bn):\nSince (0; c; a; b) is a (2; 2)-NSC, there is no coordinate i such that\nboth ai 62 f0; cig and bi 62 f0; cig.\nWe consider the sum\n\u0006 := d(0; a) + d(0; b) + d(c; a) + d(c; b)\n=w(a) + w(b) + w(a \u0000 c) + w(b\u0000 c):\nWe have trivially that\n4d1 \u0014 \u0006 \u0014 4m1:\nConsider now the matrix with rows 0; c; a; b. Let xi be the ith\ncolumn in this matrix. We assume, with no loss of generality, that c =\n(1; . . . ; 1; 0; . . . 0); this is clearly achievable by permuting columns\nand multiplying columnwise by the appropriate nonzero element. Then,\nwe are left with four main types of columns\nType 0: xi = (0; 0; 0; 0)\nType I: xi 2 f(0; 0; 0; \u000b); (0; 0; \u000b; 0)g; \u000b 6= 0\nType IIa: xi 2 f(0; 1; 0; 0); (0; 1; 1; 1)g\nType IIb: xi 2 f(0; 1; 0; 1); (0; 1; 1; 0)g\nType III: xi 2 f(0; 1; 0; \f); (0; 1; \f; 0);\n(0; 1; 1; \f); (0; 1; \f; 1)g; \f 62 f0; 1g:\nNo other possibility exists because the rows form a (2; 2)-NSC. We\nhave now that\n\u0006 =\nn\ni=1\n\u001b(xi)\nwhere \u001b(xi) is 0 for Type 0, 2 for Types I and II, and 3 for Type III.\nLet vX denote the number of columns of Type X. Then we get\nn = v0 + vI + vII + vIII (1)\n\u0006 =2vI + 2vII + 3vIII: (2)\nLemma 1: If (0; c; a; b) is a (2; 2)-NSC, then\n\u0006 = w(c) + w(a \u0000 b) + w(a + b \u0000 c):\nProof: We have trivially that\nn\u0000 w(c) = v0 + vI : (3)\nDefine two vectors\ny =(y1; y2; . . . ; yn) := a + b \u0000 c\nz =(z1; z2; . . . ; zn) := a \u0000 b:\nWe have that\nxi of Type 0 ) yi = 0 ^ zi = 0\nxi of Type I ) yi = \u000b ^ zi = \u0006\u000b\nxi of Type IIa ) yi = \u0006\u000b ^ zi = 0\nxi of Type IIb ) yi = 0 ^ zi = \u0006\u000b\nxi of Type III ) yi 6= 0 ^ zi 6= 0:\nThis gives\nn\u0000 w(a + b \u0000 c) =n\u0000 w(y) = v0 + vIIb\nn\u0000 w(a \u0000 b) =n\u0000 w(z) = v0 + vIIa:\nBy adding together the two equations above as well as (3), we get\n3n\u0000(w(c)+w(a\u0000b)+w(a+b\u0000c)) = 3v0+vIIa+vIIb+vI:\nFrom (2) and (1) we get that\n\u0006 =3n\u0000 (3v0 + vIIa + vIIb + vI)\n=w(c) + w(a \u0000 b) + w(a + b \u0000 c)\nas required.\nWe observe that d(a; b) = w(a \u0000 b) and d(0; c) = w(c) are dis-\ntances in the code; hence they are bounded by m1. If C is linear, then\nw(a+ b\u0000 c) is also a distance in the code and is thus bounded by m1.\nIf C is nonlinear, we still have w(a + b \u0000 c) \u0014 n. This gives directly\nthe following theorem.\nTheorem 1: If a code satisfies 4d1 > 2m1 + n, or if 4d1 > 3m1\nand it is linear, then it is (2; 2)-separating.\nExample 1: Take a linear projective code over GF (p2) [10] with\nlength\nn =\n(pk \u0000 (\u00001)k )(pk \u00001 \u0000 (\u00001)k \u00001)\np2 \u0000 1\ndimension k1 and weights w1 = p2k \u00003, w2 = p2k \u00003 + (\u0000p)k \u00002.\nIn the case p = 2 for k1 = 4 it gives a [45; 4; 32]4 code, which is\n(2; 2)-separating sincem1 = w2 = 39 and it satisfies 4d1 > 3 = m1.\nExample 2: A three-weight code over GF; (p) is given in [10] with\nlength\nn = p+ 1 + p2(pk \u00001 \u0000 (\u00001)k \u00001)(pk \u00002 \u0000 (\u00001)k \u00002)=(p\u0000 1)\ndimension k = 2k1 and weights w1 = p2k \u00002\u0000 (\u0000p)k \u0000 (\u0000p)k \u00001,\nw2 = p\n2k \u00002\n, w3 = p\n2k \u00002 \u0000 (\u0000p)k .\nIn the binary case for k = 6 it gives a [39; 6; 20] code, which is\n(2; 2)-separating since m1 = w3 = 24 and it satisfies 4d1 > 3m1.\nCorollary 1: All linear, equidistant codes are (2; 2)-separating. A\nnonlinear, equidistant code is (2; 2)-separating if 2d1 > n.\n2608 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY, VOL. 48, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 2002\nThe nonlinear case of the corollary was proved in [8] by other\nmethods. Note that it is tight\nC = f(1000); (0100); (0010); (0001)g\nis an equidistant (4; 4) code with distance 2, but not separating. The\nlinear case of the theorem is also tight, as the following example shows.\nExample 3: From the proposition we get that if (0; c; a; b) is a\nbinary (2; 2)-NSC and 4d1 = 3m1, then\nw(c) =w(a \u0000 b) = w(a + b \u0000 c) = m1 = 4l\nw(a) =w(b) = w(a \u0000 c) = w(b\u0000 c) = d1 = 3l:\nIt turns out that the only possible (2; 2)-NSC is the following, or repli-\ncations thereof:\n0 =000000\nc =111100\na =110010\nb =101001:\nNote that the linear code ha; b; ci has also d1 = 3 and m1 = 4.\nBy m2 we denote the maximum support size of the union of two\ncodewords.\nProposition 2: If C is binary, linear, and 2d1 > m2, then it is\n(2; 2)-separating.\nProof: Let (0; c; a; b) be a (2; 2)-NSC. We consider first the\ncase wherea, b, and c are linearly independent. Thena+b,a+b+c, and\nc are the three nonzero codewords in some two-dimensional subcode\nD. Thus, we get that\nw(c) + w(a \u0000 b) + w(a + b \u0000 c) = 2w(a+ b; c) \u0014 2m2; (4)\nand by Lemma 1 that\n4d1 \u0014 \u0006 = w(c) + w(a \u0000 b) + w(a + b \u0000 c) \u0014 2m2: (5)\nIf a, b, and c are linearly dependent, then a + b + c = 0, and (4)\nbecomes\nw(c) + w(a \u0000 b) + w(a + b \u0000 c) \u0014 2m1\nwhich is stronger than (5).\nIt is easy to show thatm2 \u0014 b3m1=2c, which is a maximum support\nweight analog of the Griesmer bound. If this bound is not met with\nequality, then the above result is stronger than that of Theorem 1.\nIV. CONCATENATION\nThe ternary construction we now introduce employs three ingredient\ncodes and applies twice the classical concatenation method, using the\nfollowing easy result.\nProposition 3 [11]: If \u00001 is a (t; t0)-separating, M 0-ary, (n1; M)\ncode and \u00002 a (t; t0)-separating, q-ary, (n2; M 0) code, then the con-\ncatenated code \u0000 := \u00002 \u000e\u00001 is a (t; t0)-separating (n1n2; M)q code.\nThe first seed is the remarkable [4; 2; 3]3 tetracode T , defined by\nthe generator matrix\n1110\n0121\nTABLE I\nRATES FOR WHICH THERE EXIST (ASYMPTOTICALLY) LINEAR\n(2, 2)-SEPARATING CODES.

In order to produce infinite\nfamilies of separating codes, we need the following constructive result\nfrom Tsfasman [12].\nProposition 4: For any \u000b > 0 there is an infinite family of codes\nU(N) with parameters [N; NR; N\u000e]q for N \u0015 N0(\u000b) and\nR+ \u000e \u0015 1\u0000 (pq \u0000 1)\u00001 \u0000 \u000b:\nWe should note that the rate of U(N) is interesting only for large q, but\nT \u000e R1 allows for concatenation with U(N) over GF (36), which is\nacceptable. Thus, consider the family of [N; K; D = d3N=4e+ 1]3\ncodes U(N), which has rate R0 \u0019 1=4\u0000 (33 \u0000 1)\u00001 = 11=52. The\nconcatenated code T \u000e R1 \u000e U(N) gives an infinite family of linear,\nternary, (2; 2)-separating and codes with rate R0=6 \u0019 0:0352.\nExample 4: We sketch a construction with a few other values of q.\nAs in the ternary case, we concatenate three codes to build the infinite\nfamily. Each one has d=n > 3=4 and thus is again (2; 2)-separating by\nTheorem 1.

Because \u0016 and \u000e are the zeros of f , we\nget\nH(\u000e) + \u000e ln(q \u0000 1) =H(\u0016) + \u0016 ln(q \u0000 1)\nor\n(\u000e \u0000 \u0016) ln(q \u0000 1) = \u000e ln \u000e + (1\u0000 \u000e) ln(1\u0000 \u000e)\n\u0000 \u0016 ln\u0016\u0000 (1\u0000 \u0016) ln(1\u0000 \u0016): (7)\nLemma 3 (Varshamov\u2013Gilbert): For almost all linear codes, the rate\nand the normalized minimum distance are related by the following\nequation:\nH(\u000e) + \u000e ln(q \u0000 1) = (1\u0000R) ln q:\nProof: This follows from equating f(!; R; q) = 0 as in (6).\nWe know from Theorem 1 that if \u000e > 3=4, then the code is\n(2; 2)-separating. Hence we can, by substituting \u000e = 3=4 in the\nVarshamov\u2013Gilbert equation, get rates for which almost any code\nis (2; 2)-separating asymptotically. The rates such obtained are\npresented under \u201cTechnique I\u201d in Table I. By the Plotkin bound, this\ngives nothing over small fields.\nTechnique II in the table is an improvement based on Theorem 1,\nwhich says that every code with 4\u000e > 3\u0016 is (2; 2)-separating. We\ninsert \u000e = 4\u0016=3 in (7) and get\n\u000e\n3\nln(q \u0000 1) = \u000e ln \u000e + (1\u0000 \u000e) ln(1\u0000 \u000e)\u0000\n4\u000e\n3\nln\n4\u000e\n3\n\u0000 1\u0000\n4\u000e\n3\nln 1\u0000\n4\u000e\n3\n: (8)\nWe have solved this equation numerically for the smallest fields, and\nthe results are given in Table I. Of course, we will always have\n0 \u0014 \u000e \u0014 \u0016 \u0014 1\nwhich will bound \u000e \u0014 3=4 in (8).\nThis results in no real solution of (8) for q \u0015 11.\nNote that, in Table I, the best results are obtained by the \u201cConstruc-\ntions\u201d for q \u0014 5, then by \u201cTechnique II\u201d for 7 \u0014 q \u0014 9, and finally by\n\u201cTechnique I\u201d for higher values of q. In the binary case, R = 0:0642\ncan be achieved nonconstructively [1].\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors wish to thank the anonymous referees for their useful\nremarks.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Yu. L.

The auxil-\niary vector filtering (AVF) algorithm is simplified through a key observa-\ntion on the construction of the auxiliary vectors. After simplification, it\nis shown that the AVF algorithm is equivalent to the multistage Wiener\nfiltering (MWF) algorithm of Honig and Goldstein. Furthermore, these\nschemes can be shown to be equivalent to the multistage linear receiver\nscheme based on the Cayley\u2013Hamilton (CH) theorem when the minimum\nmean-square error (MMSE) criterion is applied to the reduced dimensional\nspace of the received signal.\nManuscript received May 2, 2001; revised March 4, 2002.
