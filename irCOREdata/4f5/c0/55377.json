Introduction\n[2] Strong, persistent and directionally constant near-\nsurface winds are one of the most marked features of the\nAntarctic climate system and are particularly pronounced\naround the coast of East Antarctica. These strong winds\nhave been noted at Antarctic coastal stations since the days\nof the earliest expeditions onto the continent when they\nproved a great challenge to the overwintering parties. The\n1912\u20131913 expedition led by Douglas Mawson recorded a\nmean annual average wind speed of 19.4 m s\u00011 and gale\nforce winds on all but one of 203 consecutive winter days\n[Mawson, 1915]. Subsequent investigation has shown that\nthe winds at coastal sites in Ade\u00b4lie Land are not only the\nstrongest in Antarctica, but the strongest on Earth close to\nsea level [Parish, 1988; Wendler et al., 1997; Parish and\nWalker, 2006].\n[3] The strong winds in the coastal zone play an impor-\ntant part in the general circulation of high southern latitudes\n[Parish and Cassano, 2001]. They represent a large mass\nand heat exchange between the Antarctic plateau and the\ncoastal region. They are also important in blowing snow off\nthe continent and onto the ocean or sea ice, and for\nmaintaining ice-free conditions adjacent to the coast via\ncoastal leads and polynyas. Although katabatic winds are a\nfeature of the surface climate of the Antarctic, they interact\nwith the broadscale circulation of high southern latitudes\n[Parish, 1992] and have been linked to the polar vortex\n[Simmonds and Law, 1995].\n[4] In the presatellite era, when it was difficult to inves-\ntigate the broadscale climate of the continent, the strong\nwinds were the subject of many observational and theoret-\nical studies, since instrumentation installed across relatively\nlimited areas could provide great insight into the nature and\nvariability of the wind systems. Such work, carried out\nespecially during the International Geophysical Year (IGY)\nof 1957\/1958, revealed the high directional constancy of the\nwinds and their shallow nature.\n[5] From the earliest investigations it was realized that the\nstrong winds were intimately associated with the shape of\nthe Antarctic ice sheet, and that the strongest winds were\nfound in the coastal region at the base of valleys. The winds\nwere linked to extremely cold air on the Antarctic plateau\nthat had cooled as a result of intense radiational heat loss\nduring the winter months and begun to flow down to the\ncoastal region as a result of negative buoyancy. These\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 114, D18103, doi:10.1029\/2008JD011642, 2009\n1British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\n2National Antarctic Research Centre, Institute of Postgraduate Studies,\nUniversity of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/09\/2008JD011642\nD18103 1 of 25\nstrong winds have often been referred to as katabatic,\nhowever, this term has been used in the literature in a\nnumber of different ways [Parish and Cassano, 2003].\nSometimes it is used in the sense of any downslope wind,\nwhile at other times it is specifically linked to the flow\ngenerated by radiational cooling over ice slopes. Studies\nwith diagnostic and numerical weather prediction models\nhave shown that the winds are linked closely to the\nunderlying ice topography and follow the gradient down\nfrom the high interior plateau [Parish and Bromwich, 1987].\nHowever, it was also recognized that the many synoptic-\nscale depressions in the Antarctic coastal region could also\ncontribute to strong winds [Simmonds and Murphy, 1992;\nMurphy and Simmonds, 1993].\n[6] The climatological upper tropospheric flow around\nthe Antarctic is rather zonally symmetric so that most\ndepressions move from west to east in the coastal zone.\nThe large number of depressions here results in the belt of\nlow pressure known as the circumpolar trough. This is a\nzone of declining synoptic-scale lows that have moved\nsouth from midlatitudes, but is also where many lows\ndevelop, especially mesoscale systems [Turner et al.,\n1998]. When the Rossby waves are amplified depressions\nmay be steered into the interior of the continent [Pook and\nCowled, 1999], however, the high elevation of the Antarctic\ninterior (Figure 1) typically limits the influence of most\ndepressions to the coastal region. Thus, in these areas the\nnear-surface winds are forced by both synoptic forcing and\nkatabatic forcing. Here the synoptic pressure gradient can\nwork to enhance or inhibit the katabatic winds depending on\nthe location of the depressions. Most depressions pass from\nwest to east in the coastal region with the winds being\nonshore as the depression approaches a location and then\noffshore once the low has passed to the east. Winds down\nthe valleys therefore tend to be suppressed when a low is to\nthe west of the base of the valley and enhanced when it is to\nits east. Recently the output from the Antarctic Mesoscale\nPrediction System (AMPS) [Powers et al., 2003] numerical\nweather prediction model has been used to examine winds\nacross the Antarctic continent [Parish and Bromwich,\n2007], which indicated the importance of both synoptic\nforcing and katabatic forcing to the Antarctic coastal wind\nregime.\n[7] Therefore, strong wind events (SWEs) are often a\nresult of a complex interplay between the katabatic pressure\ngradient force (PGF) and the broadscale synoptic PGF and\nthat it is difficult to apply any simple classification to the\nwinds observed and that the forcing may change with time.\nFigure 1. A map of the Antarctic showing the locations of the stations referred to in the text. The\ncontours indicate the orographic height used by ERA-40 (meters).\nD18103 TURNER ET AL.: STRONG WIND EVENTS IN THE ANTARCTIC\n2 of 25\nD18103\nA primary goal of this paper is to examine the role of\nsynoptic-scale weather systems in giving SWEs at the\ncoastal stations.\n[8] While there have been many observational [Turner et\nal., 2001], theoretical [Ball, 1960; Parish and Bromwich,\n1987] and numerical modeling [Parish and Waight, 1987;\nGalle\u00b4e et al., 1996; Heinemann, 1997; Adams, 2005] studies\nof katabatic winds and other SWEs, there has been much\nless work on the climatology of extreme winds. It is now\n50 years since the IGY and a number of stations have\noperated continuously over this period. Their record of in\nsitu meteorological observations provides an extremely\nvaluable resource with which to investigate the frequency\nof SWEs and any changes over the last half century. In this\npaper we examine strong winds in the Antarctic coastal\nregion, with such events being taken as 10-min mean wind\nspeeds above various values on the Beaufort wind scale (see\nTable 1). The frequency with which observations have been\nmade at the stations has occasionally changed over time, but\nfor consistency we have used only the 6-hourly data.\n[9] Most work to date has been concerned with SWEs in\nthe Antarctic coastal region, or on the slopes immediately\ninland. Wind speeds on the high plateau are much lower\nthan around the coast because of the more gentle topo-\ngraphic slopes (see Figure 1) and the limited occurrence of\nsynoptic-scale weather systems. Yet conditions in the inte-\nrior of the Antarctic are of great importance because of the\nprecipitation that falls there and how this might change in\nthe future in response to global warming [Bracegirdle et al.,\n2008]. Most research here on extremes has been concerned\nwith large positive temperature anomalies at the plateau\nstations as maritime air masses occasionally penetrate far\ninto the interior [Sinclair, 1981]. So here we present the first\ndetailed analysis of SWEs at Amundsen-Scott station at the\nSouth Pole and Vostok on the plateau of East Antarctica,\nsince these are the only two stations with long meteorolog-\nical records in the interior.\n[10] In section 2 we consider the data available to\ninvestigate SWEs and discuss data quality and availability.\nSection 3 examines the synoptic conditions that give rise to\nSWEs and we present representative cases involving the\ninteraction of the downslope flow and the broadscale\ncirculation. In section 4 we consider the occurrence, vari-\nability and trends in the wind reports. We conclude by\nsummarizing our current knowledge of SWEs and present-\ning output from a high resolution, limited area atmospheric\nmodel. We also discuss possible future work.\n2. Data\n[11] This study is based on the in situ surface meteoro-\nlogical observations of wind strength, direction, temperature\nand pressure from stations that are staffed year round and\nhave mostly operated since around the middle of the\ntwentieth century (Table 2). Faraday (now the Ukrainian\nVernadsky station) was established in 1947, but some of the\ndata are questionable in the late 1940s, so here we have\nused the observations from the start of 1950. Most of the\nstations (Mirny, Davis, Dumont d\u2019Urville, Halley, Mawson,\nMcMurdo, Syowa, Amundsen-Scott and Vostok) were\nestablished in the period leading up to the IGY, or during\nthe actual period of the experiment (1957\u20131958), with\nCasey established in 1959 and Molodeznaja in 1963. The\nshortest record we have used, which begins in 1968, is from\nBellingshausen Station near the tip of the Antarctic Penin-\nsula. The climate at this northerly station near the polar front\nis quite different from that at the coastal stations of East\nAntarctica, but the data from Bellingshausen provides a\nvaluable perspective on SWEs where there is no influence\nof katabatic flow. We have not used data from stations with\nshorter records since we are concerned with changes over\nlong periods for which we can investigate significant trends.\nThe locations of the 14 stations used are shown in Figure 1.\n[12] Clearly using data from these stations only allows us\nto examine SWEs under a limited range of conditions across\nthe Antarctic. While Cape Denison (67.1\u0001S, 143\u0001E) is\nregarded as possibly having the highest mean wind speeds\non the continent, it would be inconceivable to build a\npermanently staffed year-round station at this location\nbecause of operational difficulties. In this study we are\ntherefore not going to see the most extreme SWEs found in\nthe Antarctic coastal region. However, stations such as\nDumont d\u2019Urville and Mirny experience strong and persis-\ntent winds from the interior and are also influenced by many\nmajor storms in the circumpolar trough. We therefore feel\nthat the data from the stations examined provide valuable\ninsight into the nature of SWEs which characterize Antarc-\ntica and the changes that have taken place in the frequency\nand magnitude of such events in recent decades.\n[13] Since the mid-1980s many automatic weather sta-\ntions (AWSs) have been installed across the continent\n[Stearns and Wendler, 1988] and the data from these\nsystems have provided a great deal of insight into the nature\nof katabatic winds [Wendler et al., 1997]. However, there\nare many challenges in operating AWSs in remote locations,\nparticularly with the measurement of wind speed and\nTable 1.

Anemometers frequently fail\nand supply suspect data during the winter so that the time\nseries of observations has many gaps. In this study we have\ntherefore used only wind data from the staffed stations that\noperate year round.\n[14] We have based the study around the surface obser-\nvations from the Reference Antarctic Data for Environmen-\ntal Research (READER) database of in situ data created by\nthe Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research [Turner et\nal., 2004], since the observations have been thoroughly\nquality controlled and where possible data obtained from\nthe national programs who maintain the stations. We have\nlimited the data used to the period where observations were\nobtained from the operating agencies and are therefore of a\nhigh quality. We have not used data obtained from the\nGlobal Telecommunications System, which was sometimes\nused in the later years of the READER database. This\nensures that the data are of the highest quality, which is\nessential when dealing with extreme events.\n[15] European Centre for Medium-range Weather Fore-\ncasts (ECMWF) ERA-40 reanalysis and operational analy-\nsis data are used to investigate the interaction between the\nsynoptic forcing and the katabatic forcing. The ERA-40\nreanalysis [Uppala et al., 2005] fields cover the period\n1957\u20132002 and have a horizontal resolution of \u0002120 km.\nFor 2002\u20132006 we employ operational analysis data which\nhas an increased horizontal resolution of \u000240 km. These\nfields will be reasonable on the synoptic scale [Bromwich et\nal., 2007], but will clearly not be able to resolve realistically\nthe strong winds in the valleys in the coastal region. Our use\nof the fields is therefore limited to considering the broad-\nscale pressure field. We only use the fields from 1979 when\nsatellite sounder data became available, since earlier fields\nhave been shown to be of poor quality at high southern\nlatitudes [Marshall and Harangozo, 2000].\n[16] The output from the University of Melbourne auto-\nmatic depression tracking scheme [Murray and Simmonds,\n1991] when applied to the reanalysis\/analysis data is used at\na number of places in the text. The variability in the number\nof SWEs is related to changes in cyclone density and the\nlocation of the major storm tracks.\n3. Nature of Antarctic Strong Wind Events\n3.1. East Antarctic Coastal Stations\n[17] Many of the coastal stations around East Antarctica\nhave reported strong katabatic winds and these are a pro-\nnounced feature of the climate. Themean annual wind speeds\nare typically higher than for stations on the plateau or the\nAntarctic Peninsula (Table 3). At 11.3 m s\u00011 Mirny has the\nhighest annual mean speed, although Mawson and Molodez-\nnaja have mean speeds of 11.2 m s\u00011 and 10.5 m s\u00011,\nrespectively. However, the mean annual wind speed can\nvary considerably over quite short distances. Syowa and\nMolodeznaja are located only 300 km apart on the coast\nclose to 40\u0001E, yet have mean speeds of 6.4 and 10.5 m s\u00011,\nrespectively, which is a result of the locations of the stations\nin relation to valleys.\n[18] The monthly mean wind speeds (Figure 2) all show a\nminimum in summer, but there are large differences in the\nannual cycle of the wind. Both Syowa and Molodeznaja\nhave a peak around April\/May as the trough off the coast in\nthis sector of the Antarctic deepens at this time of year\nincreasing the pressure gradient in the coastal region. The\nannual cycles at the other stations are also strongly influ-\nenced by changes in the centers of the circumpolar trough\njust to the north of the coastal region.\n[19] Individual SWEs are a result of the combined effects\nof the katabatic and synoptic-scale PGFs. The importance of\nkatabatic flow at each station can be estimated by consid-\nering the location of a station in relation to the \u2018\u2018confluence\nzones\u2019\u2019 apparent on the streamline map produced by Parish\nand Bromwich [1987]. This field was produced using a\nmodel that only considered the buoyancy forcing, so it gives\nan estimate of the strength of the wind when synoptic\nforcing is small or absent. Of all the East Antarctic coastal\nstations Dumont d\u2019Urville is closest to a major confluence\nzone, which results from the flow down from a large sector\nof Terre Ade\u00b4lie and George V Land.

Monthly mean wind speeds (m s\u00011) at (a) the East Antarctica coastal stations, (b) the\nAntarctic Peninsula stations, and (c) the plateau stations.\nD18103 TURNER ET AL.: STRONG WIND EVENTS IN THE ANTARCTIC\n5 of 25\nD18103\nin exposing the stations to the downslope flow or providing\na degree of shielding.\n[20] For the SWEs of storm force or greater that are\nconsidered around the coast of East Antarctica, forcing from\nthe broadscale synoptic flow is found to be important in the\nmajority of the cases examined. This can be seen via\nthe wind roses for all winter season wind reports and the\n100 strongest wind observations (Figures 3a and 3b).This is\nconsistent with the study of a SWE in the autumn carried\nout with a numerical model [Parish and Cassano, 2003],\nwhich showed that in this case the katabatic component\nconstituted only a small fraction of the total PGF. In\naddition, the modeling study of van den Broeke and van\nLipzig [2003a] found that over the gentle inland slopes in\nJuly the synoptic-scale PGF could be as important as the\nkatabatic PGF.\n[21] With single station data it is not possible to determine\nthe gradient of the pressure field, but we have examined the\nanomalies from the monthly mean MSLP (mean sea level\npressure) in relation to the wind speed. The 1212 reports of\nstorm force winds or stronger for Mawson over 1954\u20132006\nare considered via a scatter diagram of wind speed against\nMSLP anomaly (Figure 4). This shows a fan-shaped distri-\nbution with the highest wind speeds associated with large\nnegative MSLP anomalies and the positive pressure anoma-\nlies with lower speeds.\n[22] Figure 5 illustrates the synoptic situation when\nMawson was reporting a hurricane force wind speed of\n37.5 m s\u00011 and a MSLP anomaly of \u000145 hPa at 0600 GMT\n25 July 2004. A deep low was located just to the east of the\nstation and had a central pressure of less than 954 hPa,\nwhich explains the extreme pressure gradient and strength\nof the near-surface winds, with the large-scale PGF enhanc-\ning the climatological katabatic wind from the southeast\n[Streten, 1990]. Less intense storms and lows farther to the\nnorth are responsible for the SWEs with lower wind speeds.\n[23] Figure 4 indicates that there are occasions when there\nwere large positive MSLP anomalies and strong winds at\nMawson. The reanalysis\/analysis fields show that such\nevents were associated with synoptic situations when a\nhigh-pressure ridge built toward the coast from the interior\nof the continent. Care must be taken when using MSLP data\nover the high interior of the continent since the values are\nextrapolated down from the lowest model level, but data in\nthe immediate coastal region will be reliable. Figure 6\nshows the analyzed MSLP for 0600 GMT 15 July 1995\nFigure 3a. Winter wind roses for the stations referred to in this study. Each wind rose is oriented so that\nnorth (0\u0001 for Amundsen-Scott) is aligned with the north (0\u0001) direction at the relevant station (shown as a\nblack dot). The dashed concentric rings on the wind roses show observation frequencies with a 25%\ninterval.\nD18103 TURNER ET AL.: STRONG WIND EVENTS IN THE ANTARCTIC\n6 of 25\nD18103\nwhen Mawson had a MSLP anomaly of +17 hPa and a\nstorm force wind speed of 26.7 m s\u00011. The low to the north\nin the circumpolar trough was not particularly deep, but the\nbuilding of the ridge from the interior created a strong\npressure gradient that promoted a strong flow in the\ndirection of the climatological wind from the southeast.\nThe case of an extreme wind event at Casey station\ndocumented by Turner et al. [2001] also involved the\nestablishment of a pronounced ridge over the interior,\nbut in this case the low over the ocean was very deep,\nwhich resulted in sustained hurricane force winds of around\n51.4 m s\u00011.\n[24] Events in Figure 4 with small positive or negative\nMSLP anomalies are associated with occasions when a\ntrough of low pressure and a high-pressure ridge occur\neither side of the station so creating a strong pressure\ngradient across the station and therefore a strong wind. To\nenhance the katabatic flow the preferred locations are for the\nlow to be to the northeast and the ridge to the southwest.\n[25] Further insight into the SWEs at Mawson can be\nobtained by examining the in situ wind reports in light of\nthe PGF as determined from the reanalysis fields. Figure 7\nshows a scatterplot of the MSLP gradient over Mawson for\nthe period 1979\u20131998 against the in situ wind speed from\nthe station. There is an almost linear relationship between\nthe pressure gradient and the winds measured at the station,\nwith the winds above \u000220 m s\u00011 associated with strong\nMSLP gradients. However, the linear trend line does not\ncross the vertical axes at zero. Instead there are a large\nnumber of occasions with a small pressure gradient, but\nwith winds of around 10\u201313 m s\u00011. Examination of the\nreanalyzed 700-hPa-height fields indicates that when the\nMSLP gradient over the station is small the strength of the\nwind at Mawson is dependent on the synoptic environment\nover the immediate interior of the continent. When the\n700-hPa flow is broadly from the southeast it acts to promote\nkatabatic flow down to the station. Even though the pressure\ngradient is small on the coast the enhancement over the\ninterior is sufficient to give strong winds in the coastal region.\nNear-zero wind speeds at Mawson are often associated with\na synoptic pattern that gives a west to northwesterly flow\nover the interior, so suppressing the downslope winds.\n[26] Most SWEs at Mawson are associated with positive\ntemperature anomalies at the surface as the low-level\nFigure 3b. Wind roses for the 100 strongest winter (JJA) wind events recorded at each of the stations.\nEach wind rose is oriented so that north (0\u0001 for Amundsen-Scott) is aligned with the north (0\u0001) direction\nat the relevant station (shown as a black dot).

As dis-\ncussed above, the strongest winds are associated with deep\ndepressions just north of the coast, and these result in\npositive temperature anomalies of about 5\u0001C. The events\nwith negative temperature anomalies are associated with\ncold air masses coming down from the plateau that have\nlittle interaction with relatively mild maritime air masses,\nand are sufficiently cold that despite the breakdown of the\ninversion still give negative temperature anomalies.\n[27] The other stations around the coast of East Antarctic\nhave broadly the same relationships between temperature\nand MSLP during SWEs and the broadscale atmospheric\ncirculation. There are minor differences in terms of how\nstorms to the north of the coast enhance or diminish the\nflow down the valleys depending on the relative locations of\nthe stations with respect to the valley, but Figures 4 and\n8 when plotted with data from other stations look essentially\nthe same. However, the environment in the vicinity of\nMcMurdo Station is quite different and warrants being\ndiscussed separately.\n[28] McMurdo is at a more southerly location than the\nother East Antarctic stations and its climate is strongly\ninfluenced by the presence of the Ross Ice Shelf. This is a\nregion of convergent katabatic flow from the many valleys\nthat drain from the Transantarctic Mountains and Marie\nByrd Land [Bromwich, 1989] and the wind regime here has\nbeen referred to as the Ross Ice Shelf air stream (RAS)\n[Parish et al., 2006]. The RAS is maintained by the\ndrainage flow off the ice sheets and a persistent cyclonic\ncirculation to the north of the ice shelf. There is often a\nbarrier wind component along the Transantarctic Mountains\nthat can give strong southerly winds at McMurdo. In\naddition, SWEs can occur as a result of the complex\norography around the station that can give rise to barrier\nwinds and mountain waves [Steinhoff et al., 2008]. Synop-\ntic-scale weather systems can also penetrate onto the ice\nshelf when the upper level steering is from the north, and\nthe whole region of the Ross Ice Shelf and the Ross Sea is\ncharacterized by frequent synoptic-scale [Simmonds et al.,\n2003] and mesoscale [Bromwich, 1991] cyclogenesis.\n[29] To investigate further the role of anomalies in the\nbroadscale synoptic flow in inducing SWEs we consider the\nmean MSLP anomaly for all the SWEs that occurred at\nselected stations during the winter months. As an example,\nthe resulting field for August when there were winds of\nstorm force or greater at Mirny is shown in Figure 9. Mirny\nexperiences winds from the east or southeast on 75% of\noccasions. However, almost 75% of the winds of storm\nforce or greater arrive from an easterly direction only\n(Figure 3b). Figure 9 shows that such conditions arise with\nFigure 6. MSLP (hPa) at 0600 GMT 15 July 1995 when Mawson experienced a storm force wind speed\nof 26.7 m s\u00011. The location of Mawson is shown by a black dot.\nD18103 TURNER ET AL.: STRONG WIND EVENTS IN THE ANTARCTIC\n9 of 25\nD18103\na couplet of low pressure to the west and high pressures to\nthe east over the ocean to the north of the station. A further\nimportant factor is higher than average pressures over the\ninterior of the continent to the southeast of Mirny, although\ncare must be exercised in using MSLP too far from the\ncoast.\n[30] At McMurdo station the strongest winds recorded are\nassociated with synoptic-scale depressions that have pene-\ntrated onto the Ross Ice Shelf, with the southerly flow on\nthe western side of the ice shelf enhancing the climatolog-\nical southerly off-ice shelf flow. A typical example is shown\nin Figure 10. Here the low tracked onto the ice shelf from\nthe north and introduced mild air with a temperature\nanomaly of +14.3\u0001C at McMurdo at a time when the station\nhad a southerly storm force wind of 28.3 m s\u00011 and a MSLP\nanomaly of \u000142.7 hPa. As with the other coastal stations of\nEast Antarctica, the conditions over the interior of the\nAntarctic can have a profound effect on the development\nof SWEs. At McMurdo the SWEs with large positive MSLP\nanomalies are associated predominantly with occasions\nwhen high pressure builds over the interior of the continent\nand across the station enhancing the gradient to the circum-\npolar trough. A number of occasions were found of SWEs\nwith large negative temperature anomalies and winds from\nthe north to northeast. At these times the reanalysis\/analysis\ndata indicated a southeasterly flow, which is the climato-\nlogical wind direction, and these events are interpreted as\nthe passage of mesoscale cyclonic disturbances close to the\nstation. The Ross Ice Shelf and Terra Nova Bay regions are\nwhere many mesoscale cyclones develop in katabatic out-\nflows of cold air from the interior [Seefeldt and Cassano,\n2008] and such systems can have a large impact on the\nconditions at McMurdo.\n3.2. Antarctic Peninsula Sector\n[31] Bellingshausen and Faraday are maritime stations on\nthe western side of the Antarctic Peninsula. They do not\nexperience persistent katabatic winds, although their cli-\nFigure 7.

They\nare located at the latitude of the circumpolar trough and\ntherefore are frequently under the influence of deep cyclonic\nsystems over the Bellingshausen Sea and passing through\nthe Drake Passage. Halley is to the southeast of the\nAntarctic Peninsula and is characterized by a much colder\ncontinental climate. All three Peninsula stations exhibit a\nsemiannual oscillation in their annual cycle of mean wind\nspeeds (Figure 2b). The SWEs at Faraday usually involve a\nnortheasterly wind with the low being located to the west,\nwhere systems often become slow-moving as they come up\nagainst the major orographic barrier of the Peninsula. The\nMSLP at Faraday is usually quite low in such situations. A\nfew SWEs occur when the MSLP is anomalously high,\nwhen the station is between a deep low over the Belling-\nshausen Sea and a large anticyclone over the Weddell Sea to\nthe east of the Peninsula. Occasionally deep lows can be\nfound in the southwestern corner of the Bellingshausen Sea\nresulting in strong westerlies at Faraday, yet on such\noccasions the station reports only small MSLP anomalies.\nMany storms track through the Drake Passage [Simmonds\nand Keay, 2000] and these have a major influence on the\nwinds at Bellingshausen. Most SWEs occur with a easterly\nor southeasterly wind direction as lows track across the\nnorthern Weddell Sea, with a secondary maximum of winds\nfrom the north as lows approach the Drake Passage from the\nwest. Around the coast of East Antarctica SWEs are\nassociated with warm temperature anomalies as the temper-\nature inversion is broken down. However, at Bellingshausen\nmany SWEs bring negative temperature anomalies since the\nstrongest winds around a low are often found in the cold,\nmore unstable air arriving from the south.\n[32] The climate at Halley is dictated by both broadscale\nsynoptic activity and flow from the interior of Coats Land,\nalthough it does not experience the intense downslope flow\nthat dominates the coast of East Antarctica. It has been\nfound that, as on other ice shelves, that there is no coherent\nkatabatic flow signature on the ice shelf on which the station\nis located [Renfrew and Anderson, 2002]. Most SWEs of\ngale force or greater at Halley occur with easterly flow. The\nstrongest winds are from the east (Figure 11a) when there is\na strong pressure gradient between a low over the Weddell\nSea and high pressure over the interior. SWEs result in\npositive temperature anomalies (Figure 11b) as the temper-\nature inversion is broken down.\n3.3. Antarctic Plateau Stations\n[33] On the high continental interior of Antarctica only\nAmundsen-Scott station at the South Pole and Vostok in\nEast Antarctica have long climate records, and these both\n30 oE\n60\noE\n90\noE\n120\noE\n150\no\nE\n180\no\n150o\nW\n12\n0o W\n90\no\nW\n60\no W\n30\no W\n0o\n80oS\n70oS\n60oS\nFigure 10.

On this high plateau the wind\nspeeds are dominated by downslope flow and are typically\nbetween 4 and 6 m s\u00011, which is comparable to those at\nMcMurdo. As with the coastal stations, there is a clear\nminimum in wind speed during the summer (Figure 2c).\n[34] At both the plateau sites SWEs are very rare. At\nAmundsen-Scott station over 85% of the wind direction\nreports for the year as a whole are between 0\u0001 and 90\u0001E\n(taking 0\u0001 as the Greenwich Meridian), since this is the\ndirection from which the downslope flow from the plateau\narrives at the station. Winds of gale force or stronger are\nmore backed and come from about 320\u0001E to 50\u0001E. Figure 12\nshows the analyzed 500-hPa-height field for 0000 GMT\n14 October 2003 when Amundsen-Scott had a station\npressure anomaly of +1.1 hPa and a gale force wind speed\nof 17.5 m s\u00011. On this occasion there was a low over the\neastern Ross Ice Shelf, but significantly, a major high over\nDronning Maud Land, which gave strong flow from the\ndirection of the Weddell Sea. All SWEs at Amundsen-Scott\ninvolve large, positive temperature anomalies as the surface\ntemperature inversion is eroded and relatively warm air\nmasses are advected south from the coastal region.\nFigure 11.

The winds at the station are mainly downslope with\ndirections from south to west, with the SWEs also concen-\ntrated in this quadrant and most arriving from the southwest.\nFigure 13 shows the reanalyzed 500-hPa-height field for\n0600 GMT 10 November 1982 when Vostok had a station\npressure anomaly of +3.3 hPa and a gale force wind speed\nof 17.6 m s\u00011. The event occurred as a result of a ridge of\nhigh pressure that had built inland near 30\u0001E directing\nrelatively warm air toward Vostok down the strong pressure\ngradient that had been established between the ridge and a\nlow in the coastal region.\n4. Climatology of Strong Winds\n4.1. Mean Occurrence\n[36] SWEs are a feature of the extended winter period at\nall the stations around the coast of East Antarctica, with a\nclear minimum number of events in summer. There are\nslight variations in the timing of the peak of activity, as a\nresult of the changes in location of the storm tracks\nthroughout the year. For example, Molodeznya and Syowa,\nwhich are close together near to 45\u0001E (Figure 1) both have a\npeak of strong wind reports in April\/May and then fewer\nstrong winds later in the winter. Stations farther to the east\nall have a peak of strong wind reports in August. The three\nstations of the Antarctic Peninsula sector all have their SWE\npeaks in August when the storm activity around the Ant-\narctic is most pronounced. The secondary peak in October\ncoincides with the southward migration and deepening of\nthe circumpolar trough as a result of the semiannual\noscillation [Meehl, 1991; Simmonds and Jones, 1998].\n[37] The percentage of winds of storm force or above that\noccur each year across the Antarctic is highly dependent on\nlocation (Table 3). Casey, Mawson and Dumont d\u2019Urville\non the coast of East Antarctica have frequent SWEs with\nstorm force winds or greater reported in 4\u20135% of the\nobservations each year. Mirny, Molodeznaja and Novola-\nzarevskaya have such winds on 2\u20133% of occasions per year\nand McMurdo, Syowa and Davis have fewer than 2%\nreported. There is a broadly linear relationship between\nmean winter wind speed and the mean number of storm plus\nwind reports per year, with those stations having lower mean\nwind speeds receiving fewer strong winds (Figure 14).\nHowever, several factors influence the number of strong\nwinds that a location receives, such as its position in relation\nto the storm tracks and with respect to the valleys that drain\nFigure 12. The 500-hPa-height field (decameters) at 0000 GMT 14 October 2003 when Amundsen-\nScott experienced a gale force wind speed of 17.5 m s\u00011.

Relationship between mean winter wind speed (m s\u00011) and the mean number of winds of\nstorm force or greater per year for the nine stations around the coast of East Antarctica.\nD18103 TURNER ET AL.: STRONG WIND EVENTS IN THE ANTARCTIC\n15 of 25\nD18103\ncold air from the interior, along with the interactions that\ncan occur between the broadscale flow and katabatic winds\nat a location.\n[38] Figure 14 suggests that the stations around the coast\nof East Antarctica fall into three general groups. Davis,\nMcMurdo and Syowa all have relatively low mean wind\nspeeds and few SWEs. McMurdo is rather a special case\nbeing located well south of the main storm track and\nremoved from many of the deepest depressions. However,\nthe station is on the western side of the Hut Point Peninsula\nand therefore sheltered from some of the strong winds from\nthe south and southwesterly directions. There are strong\nbarrier winds on the western side of the Ross Ice Shelf, but\nthis flow is often deflected away from McMurdo by Minna\nBluff or the blocking effects of Ross Island.\n[39] Davis and Syowa are both at locations where the\norography of the Antarctic extends northward to their east,\nso limiting the extent to which storms over the Southern\nOcean can enhance the katabatic flow, which is anyway\nrather weak at these locations [King and Turner, 1997,\nFigure 4.6]. Casey, Dumont d\u2019Urville and Mawson are well\nplaced for depressions in the circumpolar trough to enhance\nthe katabatic flow. At Dumont d\u2019Urville and Mawson these\nare from the southeast and with storms to the northeast of\nthe stations the broadscale and katabatic PGFs can work\ntogether to enhance the flow. Casey is located to the west of\nLaw Dome and the prevailing wind is from that direction.\nNinety-three percent of the SWEs come from the east\nsuggesting that this is one of the best placed sites for storms\nto the north to enhance the prevailing flow: seven of the\nstations around East Antarctica have most SWEs arriving\nfrom the prevailing wind quadrant, with only McMurdo and\nMirny having the peak within 45 degrees.\n[40] Novolazarevska, Molodeznaja and Mirny all have\nrelatively high mean wind speeds yet relatively few SWEs.\nTheir prevailing wind directions are from the southeast,\nwith the SWEs mostly associated with this wind direction.\nFrom our understanding of the synoptic background when\nSWEs occur (Figure 8), we know that broadscale support\nfrom a deep low off the coast is necessary to enhance the\nflow to storm force or above. The lack of SWEs at these\nlocations considering their high mean wind speed suggests\nthat the local orography is not conducive to the PGF from\nlarge lows to the north enhancing the katabatic flow to the\nextent that occurs at other stations.\n4.2. Interannual Variability\n[41] The interannual variability in the number of SWEs is\nlarge at many of the stations around the Antarctic. For\nexample, at Casey station the number of reports of winds\ngreater than storm force during July varies between 2 and 26\nover 1960 to 2005 (Figure 15). Since winds of this strength\nare linked to synoptic-scale activity off the coast, the\nnumber of reports in any one winter month is related to\nthe amplitude and location of the Rossby waves. For\nexample, July 2001 saw many SWEs at Casey as there\nwas an amplified wave number 3 pattern, with the marked\nupper trough close to 90\u0001E (Figure 16) giving many surface\ncyclones in the vicinity of the station. This was apparent in\nthe output from the University of Melbourne automatic\nFigure 15. Number of reports of winds of storm force or greater in July at Casey.\nD18103 TURNER ET AL.: STRONG WIND EVENTS IN THE ANTARCTIC\n16 of 25\nD18103\ndepression tracking scheme, which had a high cyclone\ndensity over 100\u2013120\u0001 E. Other years with many SWEs,\nsuch as 1995, 1982 and 2002, all had an amplified 500-hPa\ntrough across the longitude range 0\u0001 to 90\u0001E and a high\ncyclone density north of the station.\n[42] With a marked trough at a particular longitude there\nwill be strong cyclonic activity to the east, but also reduced\noccurrence of depressions to the west of the location.\nTherefore, in July 2001 Davis station, which was located\nto the east of the strong upper trough, had very few SWEs at\nthe time that Casey had one of its windiest months.\n[43] The upper level environment varies on a year-to-year\nbasis, with some years having a broad trough across this\nsector, while others, such as 2001 had a distinct upper\ncenter. Years of few SWEs, such as 1999, 1998 and 1988,\nhad an upper flow characterized by ridging from the north\nin this sector of the continent and therefore fewer deep\ncyclones.\n[44] The points made above regarding the relationship\nbetween the number of SWEs in a particular month and the\nlocation of nearby upper troughs apply to the other coastal\nstations, especially around East Antarctica. The local orog-\nraphy and the location of depressions in relation to a station\nare important factors in controlling the winds at a site, but\nthe Rossby wave activity is the main controlling factor in\ndictating the interannual variability of SWEs.\n[45] The correlation between the number of SWEs at\nadjacent stations is rather low since the synoptic environ-\nment that gives rise to events can be a broadscale upper\nanomaly or a much more regional perturbation. For exam-\nple, with Casey and Mirny stations, which are about 700 km\napart, July 1982 resulted in a large number of storm force\nwind reports at both stations since they were both under the\ninfluence of a broad upper trough that spanned this sector.\n4.3. Trends in the Mean Wind Speeds and the Number\nof SWEs\n[46] Determining the trends in the number of SWEs is\nhampered by the rather incomplete nature of some of the\nwind records from the stations, especially in the winter\nmonths, when observing conditions can be poor, and also in\nthe early years when instrumentation was not as robust as\ntoday. In addition, care must be taken when computing\ntrends from the wind data as instrumentation and the\ninstrument locations will have changed at some of the\nlocations so affecting the wind measurements. As part of\nthe READER project an attempt was made to locate\nmetadata for the Antarctic stations in order to identify\npossible jumps in the time series resulting from instrumental\nfactors. However, as can be seen on the READER web\nsite (http:\/\/www.antarctica.ac.uk\/met\/READER\/metadata\/\nmetadata.html), metadata could only be found for a rela-\nFigure 16. Mean 500-hPa-height field (decameters) for July 2001.\nD18103 TURNER ET AL.: STRONG WIND EVENTS IN THE ANTARCTIC\n17 of 25\nD18103\ntively small number of stations. Nevertheless, it is clear that\nthe move of Casey station between 1988 and 1989 had a\nmajor influence on the wind data, resulting in large trends in\nwind speed and the number of SWEs at this site. But as they\nare an artifact of the instrument location trends will only be\nconsidered for the post-1989 period.\n[47] In this section we will consider changes in the\nmonthly mean wind speeds at the stations in parallel with\nexamining changes in the number of SWEs. To determine\ntrends we will only use data from a particular month if at\nleast 90% of the 6-hourly wind reports are available.\n[48] Table 4 summarizes the winter season trends in wind\nspeed from the stations used in this study. Results are\npresented for the full length of the records, as well as for\n1979\u20132006, for which reliable reanalysis\/analysis fields are\navailable and over which changes in atmospheric circulation\ncan be examined. It was not possible to determine wind\nspeed trends for McMurdo since there were 12 years with\nmissing winter wind data during the late 1980s and 1990s.\n[49] The most striking change has been an increase in the\nmean winter wind speed at a number of the stations around\nthe coast of East Antarctica: Mawson, Davis, Molodeznaja\nand Syowa have all experienced an increase of wind speed\nin the range 0.2\u00010.3 m s\u00011 decade\u00011, although only the\nincrease at Syowa is statistically significant since the other\nstations have a large interannual variability in the wind\nspeed.\n[50] At Mawson most wind reports are in the sector\n90\u0001E\u2013150\u0001E and most SWEs are reported from this direc-\ntion. Deep synoptic-scale lows in the circumpolar trough\nenhance the katabatic flow down from the interior of the\ncontinent and it is difficult to differentiate \u2018\u2018pure\u2019\u2019 katabatic\nflow from that with a strong synoptic influence. However,\nover 1979\u20132006 the wind speed increased by 1.22 m s\u00011\ndecade\u00011, which is consistent with the changes in MSLP\nshown in Figure 17. This shows that there has been a trend\ntoward lower pressures off the Amery Ice Shelf with\nincreasing pressures to the west around 45\u0001E. This has\nresulted in a stronger synoptic PGF along the coast that has\nenhanced the flow down the valleys feeding toward the\ncoast. This is reflected in the wind speed trends as a\nfunction of direction, which show a reduction in the speed\nfrom an easterly direction and increases in speeds in the\nsoutherly and southeasterly winds. As the wind speeds have\nincreased so there has been a greater number of SWEs, and\nas can be seen in Table 5, the increase in the number of\nwinds of gale force or greater at Mawson is the largest of\nany station over 1979\u20132006.\n[51] The change in flow regime to more cyclonic activity\noff the Amery Ice Shelf is also apparent in the winds at\nDavis. The in situ observations show that SWEs come from\ntwo main wind directions at about 40\u0001E and 70\u0001E with the\nwinds being drawn down the valleys that descend from the\npromontory to the east of this location. In this area there is a\ncomplex interaction between the katabatic flow and storm\nactivity. The winds arriving from about 70\u0001E tend to be\nassociated with lower MSLP values and higher temper-\natures, suggesting that winds from this direction are more a\nresult of synoptic activity. On the other hand, the winds\narriving from about 40\u0001E tend to have more positive MSLP\nanomalies and colder temperatures suggesting these are\nmore katabatically driven winds. The Davis near-surface\nwinds during the winter have increased by 0.28 m s\u00011\ndecade\u00011 since 1969, although this trend is not statistically\nsignificant. However, the trend of 0.66 m s\u00011 decade\u00011 over\n1979\u20132006 is significant at less than the 5% level. During\nthis period the winds from the north have decreased, with a\nstrengthening of the winds between northeast and southeast.\nThere has also been an increase in the number of gale reports.\n[52] Another region where there has been a change in the\natmospheric circulation since 1979 is in the coastal region\nclose to the Greenwich Meridian (Figure 17). Here there has\nbeen a trend toward a more cyclonic circulation with the\ngreatest change being a drop of MSLP of around 1 hPa\ndecade\u00011. This has had an impact on the winds at Novola-\nzarevskya station, which is most strongly affected by\ncyclonic systems to the north and where the majority of\nSWEs are associated with large negative MSLP anomalies.\nAt this station the winter mean wind speed has increased by\n0.37 m s\u00011 decade\u00011 since 1979, although this trend is not\nstatistically significant. This station receives its strongest\nwinds from the southeast and since 1979 the mean wind\nspeed from this direction has increased as pressures off the\ncoast have decreased, intensifying the east to southeasterly\nTable 4.

Mirny is to the west of an\narea of increasing pressure where there has been a small\nincrease in the northerly component of the wind and no\nenhancement to the climatological east to southeasterly flow\nthat gives most of the SWEs. Similarly, Syowa and Molo-\ndeznaja are both located in areas of little pressure change\nsince 1979 and have both experienced very small changes in\nmean winter wind speed and the number of gale reports.\n[54] Dumont d\u2019Urville experiences frequent and persis-\ntent strong winds arriving at the station from a southeasterly\ndirection down the valleys. Winds of storm force or greater\nare associated with a mean MSLP anomaly of around\n\u00014 hPa off the coast, but a large positive pressure anomaly\nover the Ross Ice Shelf, indicating the importance of\npressure anomalies some distance from the stations. As\ncan be seen in Figure 17, the station is on the boundary\nbetween positive and negative MSLP trends since 1979.\nThese circulation changes will have led to a slightly more\nsoutherly PGF leading to greater flow off the continent. This\nis reflected in the increase in winter mean wind speed of\n0.14m s\u00011 decade\u00011 and slight increase in the number of gale\nreports. Examination of the wind speed changes by direc-\ntion shows that flow from the southeast increased the most.\n[55] On the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula the\nmean winter wind speed at Faraday\/Vernadsky has in-\ncreased in recent decades. Over 1950\u20132006 it increased at\na rate of 0.22 m s\u00011 decade\u00011, which is significant at less\nthan the 5% level. Since 1979 the increase has been larger at\n0.32 m s\u00011 decade\u00011, although because of the large inter-\nannual variability of the speed this trend is not statistically\nsignificant. Most winds at the station are from the north or\nnorthwest since the station is to the east of the Amundsen\nSea Low and the climatological trough over the Amundsen-\nBellingshausen Sea extending eastward from that center.\nThere is a close relationship (a correlation coefficient of\n0.63) between the winter mean wind speed and surface\ntemperature (Figure 18) with higher wind speeds (essentially\nstronger northerly winds) associated with increased advec-\ntion of mild air and higher temperatures. From 1979 until\nthe late 1990s the mean wind speeds were quite variable\nwith a number of winters with low speeds, such as 1987,\nwhen temperatures were cold. However, since 1998 winters\nhave repeatedly had stronger wind speeds with consequent\nhigher temperatures. Figure 17 indicates that since 1979\nsurface pressures have tended to be higher across the\nAmundsen Bellingshausen Sea, but importantly pressures\nhave decreased at the base of the Antarctic Peninsula.\nExamination of the wind speed and MSLP data for\nFaraday\/Vernadsky shows that throughout the period\n1979\u20132006, low-pressure values during winter have always\nbeen associated with strong winds from the north to\nnorthwest. However, the wind speeds associated with win-\nters with positive pressure anomalies have been increasing.\nExamination of the mean winter MSLP reanalysis\/analysis\nfields over this period suggest that during the 1980s and\nearly 1990s ridging over the southern Antarctic Peninsula\ngave a southerly component to the winds and inhibited the\nclimatological northwesterlies, resulting in lower wind\nspeeds. However, since the early 1990s MSLP has de-\ncreased over the southern Antarctic Peninsula (Figure 17),\nallowing the northwesterlies to be established even when\npressures are relatively high at the latitude of the circum-\npolar trough.\n[56] Elsewhere in the Antarctic Peninsula region wind\nspeeds have generally decreased since 1979. At its location\nnear the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula Bellingshausen\nFigure 18. Winter mean temperature (dashed line (\u0001C)) and wind speed (solid line (m s\u00011)) at Faraday\/\nVernadsky station over 1979\u20132006.\nD18103 TURNER ET AL.: STRONG WIND EVENTS IN THE ANTARCTIC\n20 of 25\nD18103\nstation was less influenced by the ridging from the southern\npeninsula area in the early part of the record, and speeds\nhave dropped by a small amount since 1979 as pressures\nhave risen to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula.\n[57] Halley has also experienced a drop in wind speed of\n\u00010.58 m s\u00011 decade\u00011 over this period, which is statisti-\ncally significant at less than the 5% level. Winds at Halley\nare a result of both conditions over the interior of the\ncontinent and the synoptic environment over the Weddell\nSea. Dronning Maud Land provides one of the sources of\nair masses that reach Halley after descending from the\nplateau and being deflected toward the west. There are no\nlong time series of in situ observations with which to\ninvestigate temperature changes across Dronning Maud\nland in recent decades. Comiso [2000] used satellite data\nto examine trends in annual mean temperature over the\ninterior for the period 1978\u20131999 and found slight warming\njust inland of the coast of the eastern Weddell Sea and\ncooling at high elevations. With the data available it is not\npossible to determine if there have been changes in the air\nreaching Halley from the interior. However, the MSLP\nchanges shown in Figure 17 indicate that there has been\nlittle change in pressure over the Weddell Sea since 1979,\nalthough pressures near the Greenwich Meridian have\ndropped near one of the climatological centers in the\ncircumpolar trough. Such a change in circulation will have\ntended to decrease the easterly winds along the coast of\nCoats Land, which is consistent with the Halley wind\nobservations, which show the greatest decrease in speed\nin the winds from between the northeast and southeast.\n[58] On the plateau the two stations show contrasting\nchanges in the mean wind speed since 1979, with winds at\nVostok decreasing slightly and those at Amundsen Scott\nincreasing, although neither trend is significant. Determin-\ning the reasons for circulation changes and changes in the in\nsitu observations on the plateau is not easy since the\nreanalysis\/analysis fields for this region are unlikely to be\nreliable owing to the lack of assimilated observations and\nhigh altitude of the plateau. In addition, changes in instru-\nmentation that may result in spurious jumps in the data are\nmore difficult to detect than at coastal sites owing to\nthe generally very low wind speeds. However, at Vostok the\nreduction in wind speed has a clear winter peak and the\ngreatest decrease has been with winds down the slope from\nDome A. This suggests that the katabatic flow has reduced\nin recent decades, although it is not possible to determine\nwhether this is a result of warmer temperatures in the area of\nDome A or changes in the circulation on the plateau.\n[59] At the South Pole, there has been an increase in wind\nspeed throughout the year, but with the largest increase in\nlate autumn. The greatest increase in speed has been in\ndirections other than down the slope from the plateau,\nwhich spans 0\u0001\u201390\u0001E. This suggests that there has been\ngreater variability in the air masses arriving at the South\nPole and a reduction in katabatic flow, although there is\nlittle data with which to confirm this.\n5. Discussion\n[60] Strong wind events are one of the most characteristic\nfeatures of the Antarctic climate system and are particularly\npronounced around the coast of East Antarctica during the\nextended winter period. Earlier studies have shown that the\nwinds are caused by contributions from both the PGF\nresulting from radiational cooling of air on the slopes of\nthe Antarctic continent and the PGF due to synoptic-scale\nlow-pressure systems north of the Antarctic coast. Around\nthe coast of East Antarctica there is a minimum in the\nnumber of SWEs in summer, which is consistent with the\nreduction of katabatic forcing over December to February,\nas shown by Parish and Cassano [2003].\n[61] Examination of the mean MSLP anomalies associated\nwith SWEs at the coastal stations has shown that\nenhancement of the katabatic flow down the valleys is\ncritically dependent on the location of storms relative to\nthe valleys. The relative contribution of katabatic and\nsynoptic-scale pressure forcing to SWEs varies considerably\naround the continent and depends on the location of the\nstorm tracks. Stations such as Mawson and Dumont\nd\u2019Urville have exposed locations on the coast where storms\npassing from west to east over the Southern Ocean can\nenhance the local flow, resulting in many SWEs at the\nstations. In contrast the relatively sheltered locations of\nDavis and Syowa, on the eastern side of embayments,\nmeans that enhancement of the prevailing downslope flow\nat these stations is unlikely unless the depressions are\nlocated at relatively southerly locations close to the\nembayments.\n[62] SWEs at coastal stations are strongly influenced by\nthe local orography, which around much of Antarctica is\ncharacterized by large and rapidly varying gradients in eleva-\ntion. Although the horizontal resolution of the reanalysis\/\nanalysis data is sufficient to capture the large-scale synoptic\nforcing, it severely smoothes the coastal orography and\ndoes not resolve complex local features along the coastal\nmargins (see Figure 1), therefore underestimating the\nstrength of katabatic winds and the influence of local\ntopography on the formation of SWEs. The coarse resolu-\ntion also results in the misrepresentation of the fine-scale\ninteraction between the katabatic and the synoptic winds, as\nwell as failure to capture localized low-level wind jets\ndriven by abrupt changes in surface drag and heat flux\n[Orr et al., 2005] at the vicinity of the sea ice edge and over\ncoastal leads and polynyas, and at the coastal margins in\ngeneral. To quantify the impact this has on the simulation of\nSWEs, the three coastal SWE cases shown in Figures 5, 6,\nand 10 were simulated using the atmosphere-only Met\nOffice Unified Model (UM) version 6.1 with a horizontal\nresolution of 0.11\u0001 (approximately 12 km) and 38 vertical\nlevels, using a nested limited-area domain of 700 \u0003 542\npoints centered over the Antarctic. UM 6.1 solves non-\nhydrostatic, deep-atmosphere dynamics using a semi-\nimplicit, semi-Lagrangian numerical scheme on a horizontal\nlatitude-longitude grid and a terrain following hybrid-height\nvertical coordinate with Charney-Philips staggering [Davies\net al., 2005]. The effects of unresolved processes are\ncalculated by a comprehensive set of physical parameteri-\nzation schemes. In limited area mode the model uses a\nrotated coordinate pole to achieve uniform resolution. The\nlimited area model was one-way nested inside a global\nversion of the model with a horizontal resolution of\napproximately 40 km and 50 vertical levels. The model\nwas initialized by ECMWF reanalysis\/analysis and daily\nhigh-resolution Bootstrap sea ice concentrations [Comiso,\nD18103 TURNER ET AL.: STRONG WIND EVENTS IN THE ANTARCTIC\n21 of 25\nD18103\n1999] and GHRSST sea surface temperatures [Reynolds et\nal., 2007] to realistically represent the surface forcing.\n[63] The SWEs presented in Figures 5 and 6 for Mawson\nand Figure 10 for McMurdo were simulated; the first and\nsecond were initialized at 0000 GMT 24 July 2004 and\n0000 GMT 14 July 1995, respectively, and computed using a\n30-h integration, and the third was initialized at 0000 GMT\n10 June 1984 and computed using a 24-h integration.\nFigure 19 compares the simulated MSLP and 10-m wind\nwith the equivalent reanalysis\/analysis fields. In all three\ncases the UM simulates appreciably stronger katabatic\nwinds and stronger winds at the stations. Figures 19a and\n19b show that the UM simulated 10-m wind speed at\nMawson at 0600 GMT 15 July 1995 is approximately\n18 m s\u00011 and the analysis wind speed is 16 m s\u00011, both\nof which are significantly less than the observed value of\n26.7 m s\u00011. The valley to the east of Mawson is better\nresolved with the UM simulation, which shows much\nstronger winds being funneled into the valley and exiting\nas a gap jet. This turns sharply to the left owing to the\nCoriolis force and forms a barrier jet which reaches Maw-\nson. This feature is almost completely missed by the\nanalysis. However, both the UM simulation and analysis\nagree that the synoptic forcing is relatively weak, with the\nlow to the north of Mawson having a UM simulated central\nlow pressure of 976 hPa and an analyzed pressure of 980\nhPa. It is likely therefore that a horizontal resolution of 12\nkm is unable to properly resolve the formation of the barrier\njet which appears to be the dominant contributor to the\nSWE, resulting in the underestimation of the observed wind\nspeed [Hunt et al., 2004]. Figures 19c and 19d show that the\nUM simulated 10 m wind speed at Mawson at 0600 GMT\n25 July 2004 of approximately 24 m s\u00011 and the reanalysis\nwind speed of approximately 22 m s\u00011 both are significantly\nweaker that the observed value of 37.5 m s\u00011. Although the\nUM simulation again shows a much stronger gap flow\nwhich turns into a barrier flow, the forcing is dominated\nby the very deep low situated slightly to the northeast of\nMawson which acts to enhance the katabatic flow. The UM\nsimulated minimum pressure of 936 hPa and the reanalysis\nminimum pressure of 944 hPa are both associated with very\nstrong southeasterly flow at Mawson. Figures 19e and 19f\nshow that the UM simulated 10-m wind speed at McMurdo\nat 0000GMT11 June 1984 is approximately 20m s\u00011 and the\nreanalysis wind speed is approximately 16 m s\u00011, both of\nwhich are lower than the observed wind speed of 28.3 m s\u00011.\nThe UM simulation and reanalysis agree that the SWE is\ndominated by synoptic forcing over the Ross Ice Shelf,\nalthough the UM simulation is better able to resolve the\nenhancement of southerly flow on the western side of the\nice shelf as a barrier jet forms parallel to the steep coastal\nmargin and which reaches McMurdo. The UM simulated\ncentral low pressure of 940 hPa and the analyzed pressure of\n936 hPa are similar, however, the UM simulated low is\nsituated farther south and so delivering stronger winds to\nMcMurdo. The three cases suggest that the reanalysis\/\nanalysis fields are able to capture the large-scale synoptic\nfeatures and the associated enhancement of the katabatic\nflow, but underestimate the observed wind speed if it is\nstrongly influenced by local topographical conditions.\nHigher-resolution simulations using UM 6.1 are planned,\nwhich will help understand further the importance of local\ntopographic forcing.\n[64] The number of SWEs occurring at a location in a\nparticular winter is strongly dependent on the amplitude and\nlocation of the Rossby waves around the Antarctic, since\nthere will be more depressions to the east of an upper-level\ntrough. Although climatologically there is a mean wave\nnumber 3 pattern around the continent, on an interannual\nbasis there will be large variations in the Rossby wave\npattern. There is therefore no significant correlation between\nthe number of SWEs at adjacent stations in individual years.\nFor example, Syowa and Molodeznaja are only 300 km\napart yet on a year to year basis the number of events are\nvery different because Syowa is strongly affected by cyclo-\nnes to the north while the number of events at Molodeznaja\nis relatively unrelated to MSLP values nearby.\n[65] The Antarctic climate system is affected by tropical\natmospheric and oceanic variability and in particular the\nEl Nin\u02dco-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), although the high-\nlow latitude links can vary with time [Turner, 2004].\nInvestigations using the reanalysis data sets have shown\nthat the most robust high-low latitude atmospheric links are\nin the sector from the Antarctic Peninsula to the Ross Ice\nShelf [Yuan and Martinson, 2001]. On average, there is\nmore storm activity in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea\nduring La Nin\u02dca events than during the El Nin\u02dco phase, so\nSWEs are more common on the Antarctic Peninsula during\nLa Nin\u02dca conditions. In the Ross Sea area there are some\nindications of consistent changes in atmospheric circulation\nat different stages of ENSO [Bertler et al., 2004], although\ndecadal time scale shifts in the teleconnection have been\nnoted [Cullather et al., 1996], which complicate the inves-\ntigation of the role of ENSO in modulating SWEs in the\nRoss Sea area. With the large gaps in the McMurdo in situ\nrecord it is therefore not possible at the moment to establish\nrobust links between tropical variability and SWEs in this\nsector. There are no links between ENSO and variability of\nthe wind field around the coast of East Antarctic.\n[66] One of the most marked changes in the Antarctic\nclimate system in recent decades has been the shift of the\nSouthern Annular Mode (SAM) into more positive condi-\ntions [Marshall, 2003]. This has resulted in a decrease\n(increase) in MSLP over the Antarctic (Southern Ocean)\nwith a consequent increase in the westerly winds over the\nSouthern Ocean. The greatest change in the SAM has been\nduring the summer and autumn with the shift being linked\nto cooling around the coast of East Antarctica [Thompson\nand Solomon, 2002]. During the winter there has been a\nsmaller shift of the SAM into more positive conditions, and\nit is estimated that at Vostok this has resulted in a cooling of\nabout 0.5\u0001\u20131.0\u0001C over 1957\u20132004 [Marshall, 2007]. This\nwill have led to a small increase in the downslope buoyancy\nforcing, although the horizontal extent of this change cannot\nbe estimated with the in situ data alone. However, van den\nBroeke and van Lipzig [2003b] used the output of a regional\natmospheric climate model run over 1980\u00011993 to examine\nthe impact of changes in the SAM on the winter season\ntemperature and wind fields across the Antarctic. They\nfound that the July surface potential temperature perturba-\ntion between positive and negative SAM polarity years was\nrather small across most of East Antarctica, but with values\nD18103 TURNER ET AL.: STRONG WIND EVENTS IN THE ANTARCTIC\n22 of 25\nD18103\nFigure 19.

However, quantifying the relative contri-\nbutions of changes in the SAM and MSLP on the wind field\nnorth of the coast is not possible at present.\n[67] Predicting how the winds across the Antarctic will\nalter over the next century is not easy, but coupled climate\nmodels can provide a broadscale indication of how con-\nditions may change under different greenhouse gas emission\nscenarios. If greenhouse gas concentrations double over the\nnext century then it is predicted that surface temperatures\nacross the Antarctic will increase by several degrees\n[Bracegirdle et al., 2008]. This would potentially reduce\nthe pool of cold air that feeds the katabatic wind system,\nresulting in an expected weakening of the katabatic winds\nreaching the coastal region. However, the Bracegirdle et al.\nstudy found that the IPCC models when run over the next\n100 years suggested almost a zero change in wind speed\nacross the continent. This may be a result of changes in\nsynoptic activity over the Southern Ocean since, as dis-\ncussed earlier, the winds in the coastal region are a result of\nboth katabatic forcing and synoptic forcing. As climate\nmodels are improved through better simulation of boundary\nlayer processes and run with higher horizontal resolution it\nshould be possible to generate better predictions of how the\nAntarctic wind field will evolve.\nReferences\nAdams, N.
