We extend a recent topological\ninvestigation of augmented k-ary n-cubes by proving that any\naugmented k-ary n-cube AQn,k is edge-pancyclic and that\nAQ2,k is panconnected.\nKeywords-interconnection networks; pancyclicity; pancon-\nnectivity; augmented k-ary n-cube;\nI. INTRODUCTION\nHypercubes are perhaps the most well known of all\ninterconnection networks for parallel computing, given their\nbasic simplicity, their generally desirable topological and\nalgorithmic properties, and the extensive investigation they\nhave undergone (not just in the context of parallel computing\nbut also in discrete mathematics in general; see, for example,\n[13] for some essential properties of hypercubes). However,\na multitude of different interconnection networks have been\ndevised and developed in a continuing search for improved\nperformance, with many of these networks having hyper-\ncubes at their roots. Amongst these generalisations of hy-\npercubes are k-ary n-cubes [4], augmented cubes [2], cube-\nconnected cycles [12], twisted cubes [8], twisted n-cubes\n[7], crossed cubes [5], folded hypercubes [6], Mo\u00a8bius cubes\n[3], generalised twisted cubes [1], shuffle cubes [11], k-skip\nenhanced cubes [15], twisted hypercubes [10], and Fibonacci\ncubes [9]. Perhaps the most popular of these generalisations\nare the k-ary n-cubes. Having the two parameters k and\nn available allows us to regulate the degree of the nodes\nyet still incorporate large numbers of processors, although\nusually at a cost to some other property such as the diameter\nor the connectivity.\nHowever, recently an interconnection network has been\nproposed that can be viewed as incorporating not just one\nbut two of the above generalisation techniques. In [16],\ngeneralisations of k-ary n-cubes, namely augmented k-ary\nn-cubes, have been proposed as interconnection networks\nfor parallel computing, inspired by Choudum and Sunitha\u2019s\ngeneralisation of hypercubes as augmented cubes [2]. A k-\nary n-cube Qkn is extended to an augmented k-ary n-cube\nAQn,k in a manner analogous to the extension of an n-\ndimensional hypercube Qn to an n-dimensional augmented\ncube AQn; however, the latter extension is more involved\nthan the former, as we now explain. The hypercube Qn\nand the k-ary n-cube Qkn are spanning subgraphs of the\naugmented hypercube AQn and the augmented k-ary n-\ncube AQn,k, respectively. In order to build the augmented\nhypercube AQn, one takes two copies of an (n \u2212 1)-\ndimensional augmented cube AQn\u22121 and as well as joining\ncorresponding pairs of vertices, as one does in the hypercube\nconstruction, one also joins pairs of vertices of Hamming\ndistance n \u2212 1 (that is, vertices that are different in every\ncomponent). In order to build the augmented k-ary n-cube\nAQn,k, one takes k copies of an augmented k-ary (n\u2212 1)-\ncube AQn\u22121,k and as well as joining these copies as one\nwould in order to form a k-ary n-cube, one also includes two\nother edges for every vertex v: one edge going to the vertex\nwhose every component is 1 less that of v (modulo k); and\none edge going to the vertex whose every component is 1\nplus that of v (modulo k) (precise algebraic definitions are\ngiven in the next section). In consequence, the augmented k-\nary n-cube AQn,k is a k-ary n-cube with additional edges.\nThe augmented 5-ary 2-cube is depicted in Fig. 1 (in two\ndifferent ways, showing different embeddings of Q52 within\nAQ2,5).\nAQ 2,5\n(0,0)\n(1,0)\n(4,0)\n(3,0)\n(2,0)\n(4,4)(4,3)(4,2)(4,1)\nAQ 2,5\n(0,0)\n(1,1)\n(4,4)\n(3,3)\n(2,2)\n(4,3)(4,2)(4,1)(4,0)\n(0,4)(0,3)(0,2)(0,1)\n(1,0)\n(3,2)\n(2,1)\n(0,4)(0,3)(0,2)(0,1)\n(1,4)\n(3,4)\n(2,4)\nFigure 1. Two views of an augmented 5-ary 2-cube.\nSome essential properties of the augmented k-ary n-cube\nAQn,k in comparison with the k-ary n-cube Qkn are given\nin Fig. 2 (see [16] for more details). As can be seen, the\naugmented k-ary n-cube AQn,k compares very favourably\nwith the k-ary n-cube Qkn. Furthermore, and importantly,\nthe augmented k-ary n-cube AQn,k is \u2018built on top\u2019 of the\nk-ary n-cube AQkn; that is, Qkn is a spanning subgraph of\nAQn,k. Thus, all routing and broadcasting algorithms which\nwork for Qkn also work for AQn,k.\nQkn AQn,k\nvertices\/edges kn\/nkn kn\/(2n\u2212 1)kn\nvertex-\/edge- yes\/yes yes\/no unless n = 2\nsymmetric\nconnectivity 2n 4n\u2212 2\nwide-diameter n\u230ak2 \u230b+ 1 \u2264 max{(n\u2212 1)k\n(n \u2265 3) \u2212(n\u2212 2), k + 7}\nwide-diameter 2\u230ak2 \u230b+ 1 \u2264 k\n(n = 2)\ndiameter n\u2308k2 \u2309 \u2264\nk\n4 (n+ 1) (k even)\n(n \u2265 3) \u2264 k4 (n+ 1) + n4 (k odd)\ndiameter 2\u2308k2\u2309 \u230a\nk\n3\u230b + \u2308\nk\u22121\n3 \u2309\n(n = 2)\nrouting time O(nk) O(nk)\nFigure 2. A comparison between Qkn and AQn,k.\nIn this paper, we further investigate the topological prop-\nerties of augmented k-ary n-cubes; in particular, pancyclicity\nand panconnectivity. Path and cycle networks are fundamen-\ntal in parallel computing; for not only is there a multitude of\nalgorithms specifically designed for linear arrays of proces-\nsors and cycles of processors but paths and cycles appear\nas data structures in many more algorithms for parallel\nmachines whose processors are inter-connected in a variety\nof topologies. For example, having a collection of processors\nconnected in a cycle means that all-to-all message passing\ncan be undertaken by \u2018daisy-chaining\u2019 messages around the\ncycle. In Section 2, we provide the basic definitions and\nconcepts relating to this paper. Our main results are proven\nin Sections 3 and 4. In particular, in Section 3 we prove\nthat any augmented k-ary n-cube AQn,k is edge-pancyclic,\nand in Section 4 that AQ2,k is panconnected. In Section 5,\nwe present our conclusions and discuss panconnectivity in\nAQn,k when n \u2265 3.\nII. BASIC DEFINITIONS\nWe assume throughout that arithmetic on tuple elements\nis modulo k, and we denote tuples of elements by bold type.\nRecall the definition of the k-ary n-cube Qkn: the vertex set\nV (Qkn) is {(an, an\u22121, . . . , a1) : 0 \u2264 ai \u2264 k \u2212 1}; and the\nedge set E(Qkn) is {(u,v) : u = (un, un\u22121, . . . , u1),v =\n(vn, vn\u22121, . . . , v1), either ui = vi \u2212 1 or ui = vi +\n1, for some i, and uj = vj , for all i 6= j}. We regard all\ngraphs defined in this paper as undirected.\nAn augmented k-ary n-cube is defined as follows.\nDefinition 1: Let n \u2265 1 and k \u2265 3 be integers. The\naugmented k-ary n-cube AQn,k has kn vertices, each la-\nbelled by an n-bit string (an, an\u22121, . . . , a1), with 0 \u2264 ai \u2264\nk \u2212 1, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. There is an edge joining vertex\nu = (un, un\u22121, . . . , u1) to vertex v = (vn, vn\u22121, . . . , v1) if,\nand only if:\n\u2022 vi = ui \u2212 1 (resp. vi = ui + 1), for some i such that\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and vj = uj , for all j such that 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n\nand j 6= i; or\n\u2022 for some i such that 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n, vi = ui \u2212 1, vi\u22121 =\nui\u22121 \u2212 1, . . . , v1 = u1 \u2212 1 (resp. vi = ui + 1, vi\u22121 =\nui\u22121 + 1, . . . , v1 = u1 + 1), and vj = uj , for all j > i.\nThe augmented k-ary n-cube AQn,k can also be recur-\nsively defined as it was in the Introduction (the proof of\nthis fact is a simple induction) and the essential properties\nof AQn,k have already been given in Fig. 2. Note that\nwe can partition AQn,k recursively as follows: we refer to\nthe subgraph of AQn,k induced by the vertices whose first\ncomponent is i, for some fixed i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1}, as\nAQin\u22121,k, and this subgraph is clearly a copy of AQn\u22121,k.\nA graph G = (V,E) is pancyclic (resp. m-pancyclic) if\nit contains a cycle of every length between 3 (resp. m) and\n|V | (inclusive). If a graph G = (V,E) is such that given any\nedge e, it contains a cycle passing through e of every length\nbetween 3 and |V | then we say that G is edge-pancyclic. Let\ndG(u, v) denote the length of a shortest path in G joining\nvertex u and vertex v. A graph is panconnected (resp. m-\npanconnected) if for every pair of distinct vertices u and v\nof V , there is a path of every length between dG(u, v) (resp.\nm) and |V | \u2212 1 joining u and v.\nAs regards the k-ary n-cube, panconnectivity and pan-\ncyclicity issues have only recently been resolved, as we\nnow explain. The situation for Qkn is confused as when\nk is even, Qkn is bipartite and consequently cannot be\npancyclic nor panconnected. For bipartite graphs, the notions\nof bipancyclicity and bipannconnectivity are more relevant,\nwhere a bipartite graph G = (V,E) is bipancyclic if it\ncontains a cycle of every even length between 4 and |V |,\nand bipannconnected if for every distinct pair of vertices u\nand v of V , there is a path of every even length between\ndG(u, v) and |V |\u22121 joining u and v (although the notions of\nbipancyclicity and bipannconnectivity are primarily designed\nfor bipartite graphs, they are still relevant for non-bipartite\ngraphs). In [14] it was shown that Qkn is bipanconnected and\nbipancyclic, when k \u2265 3 and n \u2265 2, and also that when k\nis odd, Qkn is m-panconnected, for m =\nn(k\u22121)+2k\u22126\n2 , and\n(k \u2212 1)-pancyclic (these bounds are optimal).\nWe shall use a specific technique whilst building our\npaths and cycles. Suppose that \u03c1 is some path or cycle\nv1, v2, . . . , vm, for some m (where there is an edge (vm, v1)\nif \u03c1 is a cycle). We say that \u03c1 can be progressively shortened\nto a path of length m\u2032, say, if we can iteratively replace a\nsub-path x, y, z, say, in \u03c1 with the edge x, z until we obtain\na path or cycle of length m\u2032.\nThe following lemma from [16] will prove useful.\nLemma 2: The following are automorphisms of AQn,k :\n(a) the mapping taking the vertex (vn, vn\u22121, . . . , v1) to\n(vn\u2212an, vn\u22121\u2212an\u22121, . . . , v1\u2212a1), where (an, an\u22121,\n. . . , a1) \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1}\nn is fixed;\n(b) the mapping taking the vertex (vn, vn\u22121, . . . , v1) to\n(\u01ebvn, \u01ebvn\u22121, . . . , \u01ebv1), where \u01eb \u2208 {+1,\u22121} is fixed.\nThe following are automorphisms of AQ2,k :\n(c) the mapping taking the vertex (i, j) to the vertex (j \u2212\ni, j), if i \u2264 j, and the vertex (i, j) to the vertex (k \u2212\n(i\u2212 j), j), if i > j;\n(d) the mapping taking the vertex (i, j) to the vertex (j, i).\nIII. PANCYCLICITY OF AQn,k\nWe prove in this section that when n \u2265 2 and k \u2265 3,\nAQn,k is edge-pancyclic. We begin with AQ2,k.\nProposition 3: Let u = (0, 0), v = (1, 1), and w = (0, 1)\nbe vertices of AQ2,k, where k \u2265 3. There is a Hamiltonian\ncycle C in AQ2,k that contains the edges (u,v) and (u,w)\nand that we can progressively shorten until we obtain the\ncycle u,v,w.\nProof: We break our proof into two cases, depending\nupon the parity of k.\nCase 1: k is even.\nConsider the following Hamiltonian cycle C of AQ2,k:\nu,v, (2, 2), . . . , (k \u2212 1, k \u2212 1), (k \u2212 1, 0), (k \u2212 1, 1),\n. . . , (k \u2212 1, k \u2212 2), (k \u2212 2, k \u2212 3), (k \u2212 2, k \u2212 4),\n. . . , (k \u2212 2, k \u2212 1), (k \u2212 3, k \u2212 2), . . . , (2, 3),\n(1, 2), (1, 3), . . . , (1, 0), (0, k \u2212 1), (0, k \u2212 2),\n. . . , (0, 2),w.\nSee Fig. 3(a) for a visualization of the above cycle. We can\nprogressively shorten the cycle by first shortening the cycle\nas it runs through zone A and then as it runs through zone\nB, so that we finally obtain the cycle u,v,w.\nCase 2: k is odd.\nConsider the following Hamiltonian cycle C of AQ2,k:\nu,v, (2, 2), . . . , (k \u2212 1, k \u2212 1), (k \u2212 2, k \u2212 1),\n(k \u2212 1, 0), (k \u2212 2, 0), (k \u2212 1, 1), . . . , (k \u2212 2, k \u2212 4),\n(k \u2212 1, k \u2212 3), (k \u2212 1, k \u2212 2), (k \u2212 2, k \u2212 3),\n(k \u2212 3, k \u2212 4), (k \u2212 3, k \u2212 5), . . . , (k \u2212 3, k \u2212 2),\n. . . , (2, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), . . . , (1, 0), (0, k \u2212 1),\n(0, k \u2212 2), . . . , (0, 2),w.\nSee Fig. 3(b) for a visualization of the above cycle. We can\nprogressively shorten the cycle by shortening the cycle as it\nruns through zone A and then as it runs through zone B, so\nthat we finally obtain the cycle u,v,w.\nAn immediate corollary of Proposition 3 is that AQ2,k is\npancyclic. However, as AQ2,k is edge-symmetric [16], it is\ntrivially also edge-pancyclic.\nCorollary 4: AQ2,k is edge-pancyclic.\nNote that we could define an \u2018augmented grid\u2019 by omitting\nthe \u2018wrap-around\u2019 edges in AQ2,k (this augmented grid is\nactually the network visualized in Fig 3). As can be seen\nfrom the proof of Proposition 3, this augmented grid is\n... ...\n...\n...\n...\nAB\nu\nv\nw\n(2,2)\n(3,3)\n(0,2) (0,3)\n...\n...\n(a) k is even.\n... ...\n...\n...\n...\nAB\nu\nv\nw ...\n...\n(0,2) (0,3)\n(3,3)\n(2,2)\n(b) k is odd.\nFig. 3. A Hamiltonian cycle in AQ2,k.\npancyclic too (though not edge-pancyclic; for just consider\nthe edge (v,w) in Fig. 3).\nNow for the general case. We begin with a useful lemma.\nLemma 5: Let n \u2265 2 and k \u2265 3. If (u,v) is an edge of\nAQn,k then there are paths of lengths 2 and 3 joining u and\nv.\nProof: By Lemma 2, we may assume w.l.o.g. that u =\n(0, 0, . . . , 0).\nCase (a): v = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0), where all components\nare 0 except for the ith, which is 1, and i 6= 1.\nDefine w = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 1, . . . , 1); that is, the jth compo-\nnent is 0, if j > i, with all other components 1. Define\nx = (0, . . . , 0, 0, 1, . . . , 1); that is, the jth component is 0,\nif j \u2265 i, with all other components 1. Define y = w.\nCase (b): v = (0, . . . , 0, 1), where all components are 0\nexcept for the first, which is 1.\nDefine w = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 1); that is, all components are 0 ex-\ncept for the first two which are 1. Define x = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0);\nthat is, the second component is 1, with all other components\n0. Define y = w.\nCase (c): v = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 1, . . . , 1), where i > 1 and where\nthe jth component is 1 (resp. 0) if, and only if, i \u2265 j (resp.\ni < j).\nDefine w = (0, . . . , 0, 0, 1, . . . , 1); that is, w is identical\nto v in every component except that the ith component\nof w is 0. Define x = (0, . . . , 0, 1); that is, the first\ncomponent is 1, with all other components 0. Define y =\n(0, . . . , 0, 1, 1, . . . , 2); that is, the jth component is 1, if\n1 < j \u2264 i, with all other components 0 except for the\nfirst component which is 2.\nIn each case, u,w,v is a path in AQn,k, as is u,x,y,v.\nThe result follows as by Lemma 2, all other cases (for v)\nare isomorphic to one of the above cases.\nWe now consider pancyclicity in AQn,k.\nTheorem 6: Let u = (0, 0, . . . , 0) be a vertex of AQn,k,\nwhere n \u2265 2 and k \u2265 3. Let v be any neighbour of u. There\nexists a neighbour w of u, different from v, such that for\nevery m such that 5 \u2264 m \u2264 kn, there is a cycle of length\nm in AQn,k containing the edge (u,v) as well as the edge\n(u,w).\nProof: Let v = (vn, vn\u22121, . . . , v1). We will prove the\ntheorem by induction on n. The base case, when n = 2,\nis given by Proposition 3 and Lemma 2. Fix n > 2\nand consider AQn,k, where k \u2265 3. Partition AQn,k into\nAQ0n\u22121,k, AQ\n1\nn\u22121,k, . . . , AQ\nk\u22121\nn\u22121,k by fixing the first com-\nponent of every vertex of AQin\u22121,k at i; for ease of notation,\ndenote each AQin\u22121,k by AQi.\nCase (a): vn = 0; thus, v\u2032 = (vn\u22121, vn\u22122, . . . , v1) is a\nneighbour of u\u2032 = (0, 0, . . . , 0) in AQn\u22121,k.\nWe assume, as our induction hypothesis, that there is a\nneighbouring vertex w\u2032 = (wn\u22121, wn\u22122, . . . , w1) of u\u2032 in\nAQn\u22121,k, different from v\u2032, such that for every m for which\n5 \u2264 m \u2264 kn\u22121, there is a cycle Cm of length m in\nAQn\u22121,k containing both of the edges (u\u2032,v\u2032) and (u\u2032,w\u2032).\nFor ease of notation, define the following vertices in AQn,k,\nfor each i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1}: ui = (i, 0, 0, . . . , 0); vi =\n(i, vn\u22121, vn\u22122, . . . , v1); and wi = (i, wn\u22121, wn\u22122, . . . , w1)\n(in particular, u = u0 and v = v0).\nFor each i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1} and for each m for which\n5 \u2264 m \u2264 kn\u22121, denote by Cim the natural embedding of\nthe cycle Cm in AQi (and so, in particular, Cim contains\nthe edges (ui,vi) and (ui,wi)). Fix j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 1}.\nFor each 0 \u2264 i \u2264 j, choose the cycle Cimi in AQ\ni\n, where\n5 \u2264 mi \u2264 k\nn\u22121\n. Join these cycles together as follows:\n\u2022 remove the edge (u0,w0) from C0m0 ;\n\u2022 remove the edges (ui,wi) and (ui,vi) from Cim, for\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2212 1;\n\u2022 if j is even then remove the edge (uj ,vj) from Cjmj ,\nand if j is odd then remove the edge (uj ,wj) from\nCjmj ;\n\u2022 if 0 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2212 1 and i is even then include the edges\n(ui,ui+1) and (wi,wi+1);\n\u2022 if 0 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2212 1 and i is odd then include the edges\n(ui,ui+1) and (vi,vi+1).\nThe resulting cycle has length m0 + m1 + . . . + mj and\ncontains the edges (u0,v0) and (u0,u1). By choosing j and\nthe mi\u2019s appropriately, for every m such that 7 \u2264 m \u2264 kn,\nwe can obtain a cycle of length m in AQn,k containing\nboth of the edges (u0,v0) and (u0,u1); that is, the edges\n(u,v) and (u,u1). A typical cycle can be visualized as\nin Fig. 4 (where we have assumed that j is odd).\n...\n...\nAQ0 AQ1 AQ2 AQ3 AQ AQj-1 j...\nCm0\n0 Cm1\n1 Cm2\n2 Cm3\n3 Cmj-1\nj-1 Cmj\nj\nv0\nu0\nw0\nv1\nu1\nw1\nv2\nu2\nw2\nv3\nu3\nw3\nvj-1\nuj-1\nwj-1\nvj\nuj\nwj\nFig. 4. A typical cycle in AQn,k.\nAll that remains to do is to find cycles of lengths 5 and 6\ncontaining the edges (u,v) and (u,u1). There is a cycle\nu,v,v1,u1 of length 4, and Lemma 5 yields cycles of\nlengths 5 and 6 containing (u,v) and (u,u1) (we simply\nreplace the edge (u1,v1) with paths of lengths 2 and 3 in\nAQ1).\nCase (b): vn = 1 and v\u2032 = (vn\u22121, vn\u22122, . . . , v1) =\n(1, 1, . . . , 1).\nWe assume, as our induction hypothesis, that there is a\nneighbouring vertex w\u2032 = (wn\u22121, wn\u22122, . . . , w1) of u =\n(0, 0, . . . , 0) in AQn\u22121,k, different from v\u2032, such that for\nevery m for which 5 \u2264 m \u2264 kn\u22121, there is a cycle Cm\nof length m in AQn\u22121,k containing both edges (u\u2032,v\u2032) and\n(u\u2032,w\u2032). By applying a suitable automorphism to each AQi\n(via Lemma 2), we may assume that for each m such that\n5 \u2264 m \u2264 kn\u22121, we can find a cycle Cim of length m in AQi\nthat contains the edges ((i, i, i, . . . , i), (i, i+1, i+1, . . . , i+\n1)) and ((i, i, i, . . . , i), (i, wn\u22121 + i, wn\u22122 + i, . . . , w1 + i))\n(with arithmetic modulo k). For ease of notation, define the\nfollowing vertices of AQn,k, for each i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k\u2212 1}:\nu\ni = (i, i, i, . . . , i); vi = (i, i + 1, i + 1, . . . , i + 1); and\nw\ni = (i, wn\u22121 + i, wn\u22122 + i, . . . , w1 + i) (in particular,\nu = u0 and v = u1).\nWe now proceed exactly as we did in Case (a) and obtain\nthat for every m such that 5 \u2264 m \u2264 kn, there is a cycle of\nlength m in AQn,k containing both of the edges (u0,u1)\nand (u0,v0); that is, the edges (u,v) and (u,v0).\nCase (c): vn = 1 and v\u2032 = (vn\u22121, vn\u22122, . . . , v1) =\n(0, 0, . . . , 0).\nDefine the vertex x = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1) in AQn,k; that\nis, the first component of x is 1, with all other compo-\nnents 0. Also, define the vertex x\u2032 = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1) of\nAQn\u22121,k similarly. We assume, as our induction hypothesis,\nthat there is a neighbour w\u2032 = (wn\u22121, wn\u22122, . . . , w1) of\nu\n\u2032 = (0, 0, . . . , 0) in AQn\u22121,k, different from x\u2032, such\nthat for every m for which 5 \u2264 m \u2264 kn\u22121, there is a\ncycle Cm of length m in AQn\u22121,k containing both of the\nedges (u\u2032,x\u2032) and (u\u2032,w\u2032). For ease of notation, define the\nfollowing vertices of AQn,k, for each i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k\u2212 1}:\nu\ni = (i, 0, 0, . . . , 0); vi = (i, 0, 0, . . . , 0, 1); and wi =\n(i, wn\u22121, wn\u22122, . . . , w2, w1) (in particular, u = u0, v = u1,\nand x = v0).\nWe now proceed exactly as we did in Case (a) and obtain\nthat for every m such that 5 \u2264 m \u2264 kn, there is a cycle of\nlength m in AQn,k containing both of the edges (u0,u1)\nand (u0,v0); that is, the edges (u,v) and (u,x).\nThe result follows by induction as every other case for\nthe neighbour v of u is isomorphic to one of the cases\nconsidered above.\nLemmas 2 and 5 and Theorem 6 yield the main result of\nthis section.\nCorollary 7: For n \u2265 2 and k \u2265 3, AQn,k is edge-\npancyclic.\nIV. PANCONNECTIVITY IN AQ2,k\nIn this section, we show that when k \u2265 3, AQ2,k is\npanconnected. Just as we did before, partition AQ2,k into\nAQ0, AQ1, . . . , AQk\u22121 by fixing the first component of\nevery vertex of AQi at i (so, each AQi is a cycle of length\nk). To prove that AQ2,k is panconnected, we work in vertex-\ninduced subgraphs of AQ2,k, namely the graphs Bi induced\nby the vertices of AQ0, AQ1, . . . , AQi, where 3 \u2264 i \u2264 k\u22121.\nThroughout, u and v are two arbitrary, distinct vertices\nof AQ2,k. Let d be the length of a shortest path in AQ2,k\njoining u and v. We will show that there are paths of all\nlengths between d and k2 \u2212 1 joining u and v in AQ2,k.\nBy Lemma 2, w.l.o.g. we may suppose that u = (0, 0) and\nthat v = (i, j), where i \u2264 j. Let us begin by supposing that\nv \u2208 B3. We shall describe a Hamiltonian path from u to v\nin B3. There are various cases to consider, depending upon\nthe vertex v.\nCase 1: i = 0.\nA Hamiltonian path from u to v in B3 is depicted in\nFig. 5(a).\nCase 2: i = 1.\nA Hamiltonian path from u to v in B3 when v 6= (1, 1) is\ndepicted in Fig. 5(b), and one from u to (1, 1) in Fig. 5(c).\nCase 3: i = 2.\nA Hamiltonian path from u to v in B3 when v 6= (2, 2) is\ndepicted in Fig. 6(a), and one from u to (2, 2) in Fig. 6(b).\nIt is trivial to verify that all of the paths constructed\nabove can be progressively shortened until they have length\nj (remember, i \u2264 j).\nLet us now suppose that v \u2208 B4. We shall describe a\nHamiltonian path from u to v in B4. There are various\ncases to consider, depending upon the vertex v.\nCase 1: i = 0.\nA Hamiltonian path from u to v in B4 is depicted in\nFig. 7(a).\n... ...\nu v\n(a) i = 0.\n... ...\nu\nv\n(b) i = 1, v 6= (1, 1).\n... ...\nu\nv\n(c) i = 1, v = (1, 1).\nFig. 5. Hamiltonian paths in B3 when i = 0, 1.\n... ...\nu\nv\n(a) i = 2, v 6= (2, 2).\n... ...\nu\nv\n(b) i = 2, v = (2, 2).\nFig. 6. Hamiltonian paths in B3 when i = 2.\nCase 2: i = 1.\nA Hamiltonian path from u to v in B4 is depicted in\nFig. 7(b).\nCase 3: i = 2.\nA Hamiltonian path from u to v in B4 is depicted in\nFig. 7(c).\nCase 4: i = 3.\nA Hamiltonian path from u to v in B4 when v 6= (4, 4) is\ndepicted in Fig. 8(a), and one from u to (4, 4) in Fig. 8(b).\nAgain, it is trivial to verify that all of the paths constructed\nabove can be progressively shortened until they have length\nj.\nWe now extend the constructions above inductively. Sup-\npose that for some 3 \u2264 r \u2264 k\u22123, given any vertex v = (i, j)\nin Br (different from (0, 0) and with i \u2264 j), we can find\na Hamiltonian path \u03c1 in Br joining (0, 0) and (i, j) that\ncan be progressively shortened until the path has length j;\nmoreover, we assume that there is at least one edge of \u03c1\nlying in AQr (this is certainly true for all paths constructed\nabove in B3 and B4). Now let u = (0, 0) and v = (i, j),\nwhere v lies in Br+2 and i \u2264 j.\n... ...\nu v\n(a) i = 0.\n... ...\nu\nv\n(b) i = 1.\n... ...\nu\nv\n(c) i = 2.\nFig. 7. Hamiltonian paths in B4 when i = 0, 1, 2.\n... ...\nu\nv\n(a) i = 3, v 6= (4, 4).\n... ...\nu\nv\n(b) i = 3, v = (4, 4).\nFig. 8. Hamiltonian paths in B4 when i = 3.\nCase 1: (i, j) lies in Br.\nBy the induction hypothesis, there is a Hamiltonian path\n\u03c1 in Br joining (0, 0) and (i, j) that can be progressively\nshortened until the path has length j. Take any edge of the\nform ((r, a), (r, a+1)) (with addition modulo k) that lies on\nthe path \u03c1 (such an edge exists by assumption). Extend the\npath \u03c1 as in Fig. 9(a). The new Hamiltonian path in Br+2\ncan clearly be progressively shortened to obtain a path of\nlength j.\nCase 2: (i, j) lies in AQr+1 (so, i = r + 1).\nLet w = (i\u2212 1, j \u2212 1); so, i\u2212 1 \u2264 j \u2212 1. By the induction\nhypothesis, there is a Hamiltonian path \u03c1 in Br from u\nto w that can be progressively shortened until we obtain\na path of length j \u2212 1. The path \u03c1 can be extended as in\n... ...\nBr\nu\nv\n(a) A simple extension.\n... ...\nBr\nu\nv\nw\n(b) Extending to AQr+1.\n... ...\nBr\nu\nw\nv\n(c) Extending to AQr+2.\nFig. 9. Extending Hamiltonian paths.\nFig. 9(b) (note that if i = j = r + 1 then we use the edge\n((r, r), (r + 1, r))). The new Hamiltonian path in Br+2 can\nclearly be progressively shortened until we obtain a path of\nlength j.\nCase 3: (i, j) lies in AQr+2 (so, i = r + 2).\nLet w = (r, j \u2212 2); so, i \u2212 2 \u2264 j \u2212 2. By the induction\nhypothesis, then is a Hamiltonian path \u03c1 in Br from u to w\nthat can be progressively shortened until we obtain a path of\nlength j\u22122. The path \u03c1 can be extended as in Fig. 9(c). The\nnew Hamiltonian path in Br+2 can clearly be progressively\nshortened until we obtain a path of length j.\nThus, by induction, we have the following result.\nTheorem 8: We can find a Hamiltonian path \u03c1 in AQ2,k\njoining the vertex (0, 0) to any different vertex (i, j), where\ni \u2264 j, that can be progressively shortened until the path \u03c1\nhas length j.\nThus, in order to prove that AQ2,k is panconnected, all we\nhave to do is to show that there are paths joining u = (0, 0)\nand v = (i, j) (where i \u2264 j) of all lengths ranging from the\nlength of a shortest path joining u and v up to j \u2212 1. With\nregard to candidate paths for shortest paths joining u and\nv, the situation can be visualized in Fig. 10. An immediate\nobservation is that if there is a shortest path from u to v\nthat leaves the grey area (consisting of the subgraph induced\nby the vertices of {(x, y) : 0 \u2264 x, y \u2264 k \u2212 1, x \u2264 y})\nthen there is an analogous shortest path that does not leave\nthe grey area. This observation can be easily verified by\nexamining the different configurations of i and j with a view\nto finding a shortest path joining u and v. Depending upon\nthe relative values of i and j (with respect to each other and\nwith respect to k and 0 also), a shortest path from u to v\nwill be constructed in one of the following three ways:\n\u2022 the first component will be increased from 0 to j and\nthe second component will be increased from 0 to i;\n\u2022 the first component will be decreased from 0 to j and\nthe second component will be increased from 0 to i;\n\u2022 the first component will be decreased from 0 to j and\nthe second component will be decreased from 0 to i.\nNote that because i \u2264 j, a shortest path from u to v\nneed not be constructed by increasing the first component\nfrom 0 to j and decreasing the second component from\n0 to i; for we can obtain a shortest path (of the same\nlength) by decreasing the first component from 0 to j and\ndecreasing the second component from 0 to i via a path\n(0, 0), (k \u2212 1, k \u2212 1), . . . , (j, j), (j \u2212 1, j), . . . , (i, j) which\nresides wholly within the grey area. The criteria in each of\nthe three constructions above can be met by shortest paths\nresiding wholly within the grey area and so we may confine\nourselves to shortest paths residing wholly within the grey\narea (see Fig. 10 for some illustrative paths).\n... ...\n...\n...\n...\nu\nv\nz\nw\nFig. 10. Possible shortest paths joining u and v.\nAny such shortest path must pass through exactly one of\nw = (k\u2212 1, k\u2212 1) and z = (0, k\u2212 1) or must pass through\nneither of w and z.\n\u2022 If a shortest path does not pass through w or z then\nit has length j, and we are done (as we have already\nfound paths joining u and v of all lengths between j\nand k2 \u2212 1, inclusive).\n\u2022 If a shortest path passes through z then it has length\nk\u2212j+i, and any such path can clearly be progressively\nlengthened until it has length j (if k \u2212 j + i < j).\n\u2022 If a shortest path passes through w then it has length\nk \u2212 i, and any such path can clearly be progressively\nlengthened until it has length j (if k \u2212 i < j).\nThus, irrespective of the length d of a shortest path from u\nto v, there exists a path from u to v of all lengths between\nd and k2 \u2212 1 (inclusive).\nConsequently, we have the following result.\nTheorem 9: AQ2,k is panconnected.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have shown that AQn,k is edge-\npancyclic, when n \u2265 2 and k \u2265 3, and that AQ2,k is\npanconnected. With regard to pancyclicity, the situation for\nAQn,k is improved in comparison to the k-ary n-cube Qkn.\nWith regard to panconnectivity, the situation for AQ2,k is\nimproved in comparison to the k-ary 2-cube Qk2 . Of course,\nthe obvious question remaining to be asked is whether\nAQn,k is panconnected when n \u2265 3. This question is\nmade more complicated due to the lack of a complete\npicture as regards the diameter of AQn,k when n \u2265 3,\nand more generally as regards the length of a shortest path\njoining two arbitrary vertices of AQn,k. As can be seen\nfrom [16], at present only an upper bound is known as\nregards the diameter of AQn,k and (as remarked in [16])\nderiving the diameter exactly appears to be combinatorially\nquite difficult. However, in preliminary investigations on this\nquestion we have tentatively obtained m-panconnectivity\nresults for AQn,k where m is n\u2308k2 \u2309 (that is, the diameter of\nQkn). We shall continue this investigation in future.\nAnother topic for further research is the tolerance of\nAQn,k to faults; for example, is it the case that AQn,k re-\nmains pancyclic when a limited number of vertices or edges\nare removed from the network (mimicking fault processors\nor links in an inter-connection network based upon AQn,k)?\nWe observe that AQ2,k can tolerate at least one faulty vertex\nand remain pancyclic (simply remove the vertex u in Fig. 3).\nAcknowledgement The work in this paper was supported\nby the U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research\nCouncil (EPSRC) grant EP\/G010587\/1, \u2018Tolerating faults in\ninterconnection networks for parallel computing\u2019.\nREFERENCES\n[1] F.B.
