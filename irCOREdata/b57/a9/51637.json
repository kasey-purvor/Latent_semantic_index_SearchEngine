However, very few such\nstudies have identified, in detail, the reasoning behind\ntheir selected behavioural change mechanisms or the\ncognitive processes that their users are expected to\nexperience.\nFroehlich et al [12] recently undertook a comparative\nreview of papers generated by both the environmental\npsychology and HCI communities which used\npersuasive technologies and stressed the need for HCI\nresearchers to collaborate with environmental\npsychologists in order to leverage their expertise when\nattempting to change target behaviour. This suggests\nthat the persuasive technologies that are being\ndeveloped by the HCI community would benefit from a\nfuller understanding of psychological behaviour change\nstrategies.\nPersuasive technologies have typically aimed to\nmotivate behaviour change primarily through\npresenting positive feedback when the desired\nbehaviour is observed [5][2]. Indeed, well known\nrecent literature by the HCI community [6][1]\nspecifically recommends that only good behaviour is\nrewarded, thus offering no consequences when users\ndo not meet their goals. Interestingly, this is in sharp\ncontrast with the findings from applied psychology,\nwhere it is suggested that corrective feedback \u2013 i.e.\npresenting consequences regardless of the behaviour\nobserved \u2013 is often the optimum approach [13].\nFurthermore, our own recent work has discussed how\nplayful aversive feedback can be harnessed to reduce\nenergy consumption in the kitchen environment [14].\nThose who suggest that aversive feedback is not\nappropriate for online behaviour-change interventions\n[6][1] often refer to the problem of users becoming\ndisengaged when punishment is delivered. It is argued\nthat the easiest way for a user to avoid punishment in\nsuch an application is to stop using the application,\nrather than changing their behaviour. It is important to\nrealise that this is an assumption rather than an\nempirical finding.\nIn this work-in-progress we investigate whether playful\naversive stimuli can function as an integral part of an\napplication designed to help users monitor and reduce\ntheir domestic energy consumption.\nApplication Design\nWe have devised an application that promotes\nbehaviour change primarily through playful aversive\nfeedback. The Power Ballads Facebook application used\nin this pilot study is a simple, early prototype. A basic\ninterface was developed that delivered feedback on\nparticipant\u2019s comparative energy by time splicing the\nprevious 48 hours of usage. A commercial off-the-shelf\nhome energy monitoring system from the company\nCurrent Cost - consisting of an ENVI display and Bridge\n[7] - was used to connect energy data to the Power\nBallads application.\nWhen a user visits the Power Ballads application from\ntheir Facebook account, the interface informs them of\ntheir energy usage by means of a large notification\ndisplaying \u2018Yes!\u2019 if they have saved energy or \u2018No!\u2019 if\nthey have increased their usage, as shown, for\nFigure 1. Power Ballads notification\ninterfaces for energy usage\n3example, in figure 1. If the user increases their energy\nusage then they are effectively punished by the\napplication automatically publishing aversive feedback\nin the form of a public post to their Facebook newsfeed.\nThis posted message would then be viewable by their\nFacebook friends. The post highlighted they were using\nmore energy over the past 24 hours compared to the\nprevious 24 hours, effectively disclosing their high\nusage, or undesirable behaviour, to their friends.\nAs energy consumption is an important issue in\ndomestic households, it was apparent that the\npublishing of aversive feedback about excessive usage\non participants\u2019 Facebook page may be undesirable and\ncould lead to the type of disengagement discussed in\n[6][1]. We were interested in exploring whether\npresenting this information in a playful manner may\navoid the problem of disengagement. To this end, we\nchose to present popular UK chart music as the\naversive stimuli posted on participants Facebook wall.\nParticipants were initially screened and accepted based\non their strong disliking for this type of modern chart\nmusic. An example of a feedback post is shown in\nfigure 2, complete with comments added by the user\nand their Facebook friends.\nImplementation\nOur software implementation utilises both the Facebook\nGraph and Pachube API\u2019s [9][4] to display participants\nlive online energy data on the Facebook platform. The\nCurrent Cost Energy Bridge and Envi display were the\nselected home energy monitor components for the\nstudy. The energy bridge provides the capability to\nsend energy data directly online to the Pachube service\nvia a home router. Figure 3 illustrates the technical\nimplementation of Power Ballads.\nFigure 2. Anonymised example of an aversive feedback post\nPachube is a data brokerage store for the \u2018internet of\nthings\u2019 and provides an online REST API that allows\nauthorised web applications to query sensor data. This\nis an important step forward in the evolution of home\nenergy monitoring as most monitors to date require PC\nsoftware (with powered on PC) to send energy data\nonline where it can be used by third party applications.\nBy using cutting edge hardware the process of\nmonitoring is more transparent to the end user by\nsending energy data directly online, increasing the user\nexperience quality and saving energy.\nExperimental Method\nAims\nThe aims of the study were twofold: 1) To investigate\nthe effectiveness of aversive feedback to engage users\nin eco-feedback applications and 2) Analyse user\ncomments generated from the aversive feedback posts\nfor emergent themes that could then be exploited in\nsubsequent eco-feedback applications.\nFigure 3. Technical implementation of\nPower Ballads\n4Participants\nUsing a mixture of purposive and convenience\nsampling, nine lead participants were recruited: 4 of\nwhich were female, from nine households.\nDesign\nEach household was given an energy monitor for a\nperiod of 5 weeks. At the end of the first week\nparticipants were given access to the Power Ballads\napplication on Facebook and could then view their\nprevious 24 hour energy usage in graph form and view\nenergy notifications based on whether or not they are\nsaving energy in the previous 48 hour period. In order\nto view Power Ballads each participant was required to\nfirst login to Facebook and start the application.\nAversive feedback would only be delivered when logged\nin giving the opportunity to examine whether\nparticipants were engaging with the application or\nsimply avoiding punishment by not using it. A short\nend-of-study qualitative questionnaire was also\ncompleted to elicit participants\u2019 subjective experience of\ninteracting with Power Ballads.\nResults\nDuring the course of the study 5 participants actively\nused Power Ballads, 1 participant did not realise they\nhad to log into the application to view feedback and 3\nhad compatibility problems with their home routers in\nrecording their home energy data. Thus, the data from\nfive of the nine original participants is presented here.\nIn total, 167 visits (75% in the first two weeks) were\nmade to the application with 50 aversive newsfeed\nitems posted to the participants Facebook wall. This\nequates to around 30% of all visits to the application\nresulting in a punishment post with the remaining 70%\nbringing about a notification indicating they were\nsaving energy. It highlights participants were engaging\nwith the application by logging in and therefore not\ntrying to avoid punishment. From the 50 aversive\nnewsfeed posts an additional total of 57 user-generated\ncontent items were created consisting of 41 comments\nand 16 \u2018Like\u2019 clicks suggesting that playful dialogue\ntook place. These user generated items were created\nby participants and non-participants who were\nFacebook friends. Additionally, 5 questionnaires were\ncompleted from all active users of Power Ballads.\nFigure 4 highlights participant engagement throughout\nthe study. The graph illustrates the number of times an\naversive post was created for each participant and the\nnumber of times overall they responded via comments\nto their own posts. Also shown is the total number of\nother feedback items including comments and \u2018Like\u2019\nclicks from other participants and Facebook users. The\nresults show that participants engaged  with their own\nand others\u2019 aversive feedback.\nFigure 4. Participant engagement with aversive feedback\n5Discussion\nWith the results suggesting that aversive feedback may\nbe effective in successfully engaging users (or at least\ndoes not disengage users), it is worthwhile to look at\nsome of the user-generated comments that were\ncreated based on the aversive newsfeed posts.\nEngagement on energy usage was present,\nParticipant C: \u201c277...are you sat in the dark?\u201d with\nParticipant B responding with:\u201d is 277 fairly low? It is\nnot extremely bright in here, but still can recognise\nfurniture and Aga!\u201d Similarly, another dialogue,\nParticipant C: \u201c313 average and you have used more\ntoday? Did you sit in the house with the lights off\nyesterday?\u201d with Participant D responding: \u201cYesterday\nit was 233 and that was higher than before that! Not\nsure what's been different today though.\u201d\nInterestingly, some of the dialogue was based on\ndetermining which appliances may be causing the\naversive feedback, Participant D: \u201cYou're using the\nmost out of Juliet you and me today! Washing day?!\"\nwith Participant A responding, \u201cFunnily enough\nyeah\u2026the washing machine, caught up on a load of\nwashing!! Just shows you\u201d. Participant D responded\ndirectly to the aversive feedback when their personal\nusage peaked at its maximum with \u201cOh good god! I\nguess that's what i get for having the oven on :( ....but\ni also get home-made bread...not sure it's worth my\nreputation though!!\u201d\nEngagement surrounding the use of chart music as\naversive feedback was also present, Non-participant:\n\u201cjls???\u201d [teenage boy band] with Participant D\nresponding: \u201cThere needs to be a smiley for hanging\nyour head in shame!!\u201d. Additionally, the quote, \u201cOh no,\nwhat are you doing to my reputation!\u201d by Participant\nC was a direct response to an aversive feedback post.\nDue to insufficient space we are unable to present a\nfuller breakdown of all the comments. However, the\nmajority of comments were centred on two themes, the\nfirst based around energy usage and the appliances\npotentially responsible for causing the aversive\nfeedback. The second theme focused around friendly\nbanter related to the chart music used in the newsfeed\nposts. These two emergent themes were mirrored in\nour questionnaire data.\nConclusions and Further Work\nThe wider goal of this study was to evaluate whether\npunishment of non-desirable behaviour can function as\na useful part of larger future studies. It is apparent that\nthis type of feedback does not necessarily lead to\ndisengagement by users if presented carefully. We do\nnot suggest that presenting only aversive feedback is\nan ideal method of designing a persuasive application;\nindeed our questionnaire data revealed that\nparticipants A and C would have liked supplementary\nreward posts when saving energy. However, we have\ndemonstrated that aversive stimuli do not necessarily\nbring about disengagement. Rather, as the psychology\nliterature suggests that aversive stimuli can function as\na valuable component in behaviour change\ninterventions. We have demonstrated that it does not\nnecessarily lead to participant disengagement, and\ntherefore conclude that it is important that this type of\nfeedback should not be simply ignored when designing\npersuasive applications, as has been suggested by\nother researchers.\n6A common criticism levelled at technology-centric\nsustainability interventions is that they use non\nsustainable resources themselves. Furthermore, many\npersuasive technology studies that are designed to\nmotivate reduction in energy use have been shown to\nbe successful in the interim. Despite this, more often\nthan not they tend to require feedback to be delivered\npermanently, albeit at a lower frequency over a\nprolonged duration [8]. It could be argued that\ntechnology-enabled interventions which incorporate\ntraditional and empirically proven behaviour change\nmethodologies (as described in this work-in-progress),\ncould eliminate the need for consistent and permanent\nfeedback to be delivered if the target behaviour has\nbeen adopted.\nThis was a small scale pilot study and only a larger\ninvestigation could conclusively determine how effective\naversive feedback may be when used in the context of\nchanging behaviour in energy consumption. Building on\nour findings, we plan to run a longitudinal energy study\ndeploying aversive feedback with a view to evaluating\npotential behaviour change in energy consumption. The\nevaluation would test whether aversive stimuli, chart\nmusic and exposing undesirable consumption in this\ncase, could actually function as a punisher to motivate\nreductions in energy usage as a result of the feedback.\nReferences\n[1] Ai He, H., Greenberg, S., and Huang, E.M.
