This article makes an inventory of the issues involved in the exchange of learning objects within a community.

One\nway of attaining this objective is to stimulate extensive reuse of learning objects when\ndeveloping new courses. A learning object is defined as: any entity, digital or non-digi-\ntal, that can be used, reused, or referenced during technology-supported learning\n(IEEE LTSC, 2002). Reuse is defined as: the integration of a learning object created\nby someone else in the context of a new course (Koper, 2003). Reuse can happen at\ndifferent levels in a so-called learning object economy (e.g., Campbell, 2003;\nDownes, 2003). At the first level, a person reuses something that is self-created.

Koper\n \n et al.\n   the second level, a person reuses something created by someone else within the\nboundaries of a specific community or organization. The third level of reuse is when\na person buys something in the open market, e.g. a book from a publisher. The\nsecond level of reuse is the one that is mostly aimed at when reuse in education is\ndiscussed. We will refer to this as a \u2018learning objects exchange community\u2019.\nThere is still a big gap to bridge between the worldwide need for reuse in education\nand actual reuse in practice. Thousands of learning objects are already available for\nsharing purposes (e.g., through systems like MERLOT, see Cafolla, 2003), but only\na small portion is actually reused in educational practice. A course developer still has\nto cope with major problems when trying to find, retrieve, adapt or use materials that\ncould be reused. For instance, in the context of Open Universities and eUniversities\nin Europe, we have experienced that the efforts required to reuse objects in most cases\noutweigh possible advantages. This is especially true when the objects are developed\nin different institutions. In many cases, course developers have decided that it is easier\nto (re-)create the materials themselves than reusing them from others.\nTo tackle these problems, we felt a need to look at the underlying basic principles\nand requirements for effective reuse in education. The basic question we had was: can\nwe define a theoretical framework to describe the requirements for the development\nof a successful learning object exchange community?\nThis article presents the framework. It consists of a description of usable back-\nground theories, models and technologies and the set of use cases that capture the\nrequirements for a learning object exchange community.\nTheoretical and technological building blocks\nSelf-organization theory\nShaffer and Anundsen (1993) define a community as a dynamic whole that emerges\nwhen a group of people share common practices, are interdependent, make decisions\njointly, identify themselves with something larger than the sum of their individual\nrelationships and make a long-term commitment to the well-being (of their own,\nothers\u2019 and the group as a whole). This vision is related to the principles of complexity\ntheory (see Waldrop, 1992), more specifically to self-organization theory (e.g.,\nMaturana & Varela, 1992). This theory states that some characteristics of the social\norganization of communities emerge from the interactions of lower level agents. The\nsocial organization that emerges (e.g., grouping, specialisation of roles, coordination\nof actions, distribution of tasks and resources, conflict resolution, quality norms, and\ninteraction standards) in its turn imposes behavioural constraints on the lower level\nagents by means of social objectives (Ferber, 1999). For instance, an important emer-\ngent property in communities with lasting participation is \u2018trust\u2019. Trust is the expec-\ntation that arises within a community of regular, honest, and cooperative behaviour,\nbased on commonly shared norms on the part of the members of the community\n(Fukuyama, 1995).\nWhen establishing a self-organized system one has to set up certain mechanisms,\nlike initial policies that reflect the purpose of the community and the social behavioural\n Building communities for the exchange of learning objects:\n \n23\n      constraints (e.g., copyright, privacy, expected behaviour, grouping, user rights\nmanagement) and mechanisms that facilitate interaction and allow policy change.\nAnother important factor is the creation of first and second order feedback mecha-\nnisms. First order means that people in the community know what comparable others\nare doing or have done. This provides information for navigation and provides\nexample behaviour within the community. Second order feedback is feedback about\nthe emergent properties in the system: what is the performance of the community and\nhow is it organized (Gilbert, 1995)? Self-organization research argues that a division\nof labour, with different activities performed simultaneously by (groups of) specialized\nindividuals, is more efficient than a sequential execution of tasks by unspecialised\nindividuals (Bonabeau et al., 1999). However, the specialization of roles among\nmembers can change when other needs arise. This implies that a person holds a\nspecialized role in a community, but that the role can change when needed, according\nto some policy principles.\nSocial exchange theory\nSocial exchange theory provides a theoretical framework with guidelines to increase\nactive participation and decrease lurking. This theory (Constant et al., 1994; Thibaut\n& Kelly, 1959), derived from rational choice theory in economics, suggests that there\nis a relationship between a person\u2019s effect (satisfaction with a relationship) and his\ncommitment to that relationship, i.e. his willingness to contribute and share knowl-\nedge. Social exchange theory argues that individuals evaluate alternative courses of\naction so that they get best value at lowest cost from any transaction completed. Liter-\nature (e.g., Hall, 2001) suggests four main reasons that could underlie the motivation\nand commitment of community members to share knowledge: \n1. Personal need, or anticipated reciprocity: learner has a pre-existing expectation\nthat he will receive actionable and useful information in return.\n2. Reputation: learner feels he can improve his visibility and influence to others in\nthe community, e.g. leading to more work or status in the future.\n3. Altruism, or the perception of efficacy of the community in sharing knowledge as\na \u2018public good\u2019, especially when contributions are seen as important, relevant and\nrelated to outcomes.\n4. (Tangible) reward: learners negotiate to get some kind of more tangible asset\n(financial reward, bond, etc.) in return.\nLikewise, others make distinctions between individual (personal need, reputation,\nreward) and interpersonal factors (altruism) (Deci & Ryan, 1985), hard (e.g., access)\nand soft (e.g., satisfaction) rewards (Hall, 2001), quantitative and qualitative gain, or\nintrinsic and extrinsic factors (Hemetsberger, 2003). Many researchers warn against\nintroducing (more tangible) extrinsic rewards as incentives, since they might destroy\nthe motivation to share for the \u2018public good\u2019. When knowledge is considered a public\ngood (McLure Wasko & Faraj, 2000), knowledge exchange is motivated by moral\nobligation and community interest (altruism) rather than by narrow self-interest\n 24\n \nR. Koper\n \n et al.\n              (personal need, reputation). A public good is a commodity that can be provided only\nif group members contribute something towards its provision; however all persons\nmay use it (Komorita & Parks, 1995). Greater self-interest reduces knowledge\nsharing (Constant et al., 1994) and people are less likely to use collaborative technol-\nogies to share information perceived to be owned by the organization (Jarvenpaa &\nSensiper, 1998). Introducing tangible rewards in return for the provision of public\ngoods promotes self-interested behaviour, reduces intrinsic motivation and destroys\nthe public good. The danger is that individuals may appear to be contributing\nsomething, but what is not contributed is more significant. This would appear to be\nmore significant when reward mechanisms are in operation (Von Krogh, 1998).\nIncentives for knowledge sharing should match the spirit of what is to be achieved\n(Sawyer et al., 2000).\nBesides intrinsic and extrinsic factors that motivate individual community members\nto share knowledge, Hemetsberger (2003) identified two other key elements of\nexchange processes and relations in a community:\nCommon goals and values.   Communities gather around a common interest, a passion\n(Kozinets, 1999). Values are important moderators for solidarity in relationships\n(Anderson et al., 1999).\nCommunal relationships.   On a micro level, intimate communal ties can be distin-\nguished (Rheingold, 2000). On a meso level there can be a web of personal relationships\nin cyberspace or trusting relationships between two or more partners (Gr\u00f6nroos, 1999).\nAll these elements of social exchange play a complex and often intertwined role in\ncommunities. The right combination of those elements can constitute a powerful\nmechanism for a self-sustaining system for the exchange and reuse of learning objects.\nAll of them define the willingness (motivation) of the members to exchange learning\nobjects in a community.\nModels for community building\nRevisiting Shaffer and Anundsen\u2019s definition of communities (1993), summarized\nabove, the features attributed to individuals can be extended by considering qualities\nattributed to the group as a whole. Communities tend to be self-governed, self-\norganized and decentralized. Common goals, values and communal relationships\nare important moderators in forming communities. Communities have their own\nidentity, which can change and evolve in time.\nA community of practice (CoP) is a group of practitioners in a certain field of exper-\ntise who share knowledge and experience. The group members typically possess\ndifferent levels of experience and novices are supported to become expert members\nof the group through some guidance (or scaffolding) mechanisms (see, for example,\nLave & Wenger, 1991). Within a CoP, collaboration is stimulated; and the members\nof the community establish a group identity with common ideas about purpose and\n Building communities for the exchange of learning objects:\n \n25\n          values (implemented in so-called community policies) that are shared by the group\nmembers. In a CoP, learning to become a (better) expert member is the major\nobjective.\nWilson and Ryder (1998) characterize learning communities as follows: \n1. they have distributed control;\n2. there is commitment to the generation and sharing of new knowledge;\n3. learning activities are flexible and negotiated;\n4. community members are autonomous;\n5. there is a high level of dialogue, interaction and collaboration; and\n6. there is a shared goal, problem or project that brings common focus and incentives\nto work together.\nWhen designing online communities, two aspects are of importance: usability and\nsociability. According to Preece (2000, pp. 26\u201327), software with good usability\nsupports rapid learning, high skill retention, low error rates and high productivity. It\nis consistent, controllable and predictable, making it pleasant and effective to use.\nPaas and Firssova (2003) developed a research-based framework of methods for the\nevaluation of usability in web-based learning environments. Eight different attributes\nare identified: effectiveness, efficiency, learnability, memorability, flexibility, robust-\nness, error minimization and satisfaction.\nSociability governs the social interactions in a community. It cannot be controlled\ndirectly, but it can be supported by carefully communicating the purpose and policies\n(values) of the community. Preece (2000, pp. 95\u201396) identifies several different\npolicies that can be addressed in a community: joining or leaving requirements; by-\nlaws; codes of practice for communication; rules for moderation; issues of privacy and\ntrust; practices for distinguishing professionally contributed information; rules for\ncopyright; and democracy and free speech in the community.\nPalloff and Pratt (1999, p. 24) give a summary of the seven basic steps to\nfollow when building a community. These steps can be considered as the sociability\nrequirements to build successful learning object exchange communities: \n1. clearly define the purpose of the group;\n2. create a distinctive gathering place for the group;\n3. promote effective leadership from within;\n4. define norms (policies) and a clear code of conduct;\n5. allow for a range of member roles;\n6. allow and facilitate subgroups; and\n7. allow members to resolve their own disputes.\nInteroperability specifications for learning objects\nThe concept of technical reuse of learning objects has its foundation in the object-\noriented approach within software engineering (e.g. Booch et al., 1999). In that\ndomain, reusability is governed by certain general principles that can be applied to\n 26\n \nR. Koper\n \n et al.\n                learning objects (Koper, 2003). Learning objects are technically reusable under the\nfollowing four general conditions (the so-called non-functional requirements for\nexchange): \n1. Optimal granularity. The object must be as small as possible without loosing its\ninternal consistency (South & Monson, 2001).\n2. Encapsulation. The ideal learning object can stand on its own (encapsulated), have\nno side effects to e.g. dossiers of learners, enabling reuse without side effects\n(Hamel & Ryan-Jones, 2002).\n3. Abstraction. Reusable learning objects are abstracted towards the context of use\n(pedagogy, media, setting) as much as possible to allow for reuse within other\npedagogical approaches, other settings and in other media (e.g., the reuse of paper\nresources in the web).\n4. Interoperability. In order to be reusable within a community, a learning object must\nbe available in an interoperable way, i.e. it must conform to the standards that are\ndefined within the community.\nA sensible approach to interoperability is to select and accept standards from the\navailable open specifications (e.g. from IMS and IEEE) first and then to look at any\nfurther specifications that are needed to establish interoperability in the community.\nHowever, communities have to take care that the standards offer the functionality\nthat they want. Too many current standards are too restricted from a pedagogical\nperspective or too complex for the restricted use of a certain community. Permanent\nmonitoring and decisions about the standards (and versions of standards) to follow\nshould be incorporated in any exchange community. We suggest considering the\nfollowing interoperability standards for exchange communities (see Table 1).\nThere are several missing specifications in the field of binary resources (e.g., for\nsimulations) and for most communication, search and collaboration services\n(although IMS Learning Design defines an initial set of services). One has to decide\nwithin a community how to deal with the missing specifications. Also one has to\ndecide how to use the specification. Most specifications allow for further customisa-\ntion or have many optional elements one has to choose from.\nUse cases for exchange\nOne approach to capture functional requirements of the exchange community is to\nmodel so-called UML use cases (e.g., Fowler, 2000). Use cases are abstractions of\nscenarios in which the concrete behaviour of persons within a system, or using a\nsystem is described (Cockburn, 2001). A use case model contains use cases, actors\nand relationships (Armour & Miller, 2001). Use cases (ellipses in diagrams) are\nsequences of actions required of the system, which it must be able to support if it is\nto function properly. Actors (stick figures in diagrams) are the persons or software\nagents that initiate the use cases, perform the use cases or benefit from the use cases.\nRelationships (lines in diagrams) link two elements to show how these interact.\nDerived from the theories and technologies described above, we modelled the use\n Building communities for the exchange of learning objects:\n \n27\n       case diagram represented in Figure 1 to capture major functional requirements. In the\nnext paragraphs we will explain the use case model.\nUse cases in a learning object exchange community (UML use case diagram, all dotted lines are <<include>> dependencies)\nActors\nDerived from the self-organization theory, we identify one type of actor that can have\ndifferent roles. This actor is called a \u2018member\u2019 and is defined as any person who is\nactually or potentially creating learning objects within the domain of the exchange\ncommunity. A member can be an individual or a group of individuals in any formal\nor informal organization. Several roles for members can be specified, e.g. the\nproducer, (re-)user, and group moderator. These types of roles search, use and add\nlearning objects. We have drawn a specific role, called the community facilitator, who\nis responsible for communal aspects, like information, promotion, editing of the\npolicies, monitoring and increase of usability. Note that these roles are assigned to\npersons, and the same person can have multiple roles. The use case \u2018change organi-\nzation structure\u2019 is responsible for the definition and allocation of roles and system\nrights. Like any rule in the system, this process is governed by explicitly defined and\ncollectively maintained community policies.\nHaving discussed (first level) requirements for technological interoperability in the\nprevious section, we will now first describe the necessary (second level) actions (in the\nTable 1.

Koper\n \n et al.\n  form of use cases) that enable the exchange of learning objects, followed by some\nbasic (third level) actions that are required to establish exchange in the context of a\ncommunity.\nUse cases to realise exchange from a technological perspective\nFind, get, edit and (dis-)aggregate.   To be able to search and find a learning object, the\ncommon idea is that a search engine can search through the metadata descriptors (or\nfull text index) of the objects. To get access to a learning object, the object itself\nshould be available for a certain price or license. One way of getting access to\nan object is through an URI reference (for example MERLOT, see Caloffa, 2003).\nAnother approach is to download a copy. Users may want to adapt a learning object\nto the specific local context of use. In order to allow for this process, the learning\nobject must be loaded into a suitable local or remote editing tool. This is only possible\nwhen the source of the learning object is available and when the source is in a format\nthat available tools support. Part of the editing process is to aggregate a collection\nof learning objects towards its aim: the building of a course. Aggregation can be done\nin several ways: through a collection of links, through a collection of physical objects\nor a combination of both. Typically a specification like IMS Content Packaging,\nFigure 1. Use cases in a learning object exchange community (UML use case diagram, all dotted \nlines are <<include>> dependencies)\n Building communities for the exchange of learning objects:\n \n29\n          as used by IMS Learning Design, will be used to for the aggregation of links and\nphysical files.\nUpload version, upload new and add metadata.   One must be able to upload new or\nadapted learning objects. This can be done with standard available web protocols\n(e.g. FTP) or even with email.\nFeedback and logging.   Feedback is needed to support self-organization, adequate\nobject selection, quality control and navigation. It is important that users provide\nfeedback about the use of a certain learning object, provide tips for other users and\nassess its quality.\nCommunicate and collaborate.   Besides feedback, other types of communication and\ncollaboration are needed for communities to share experiences. One must be able to\ncommunicate members\u2019 profiles, including information about the member\u2019s role and\npast performance in the community. This provides a means to look at a member\u2019s\nbackground and reputation, e.g. a feedback provider, to judge the relevance and qual-\nity of the contribution. It also provides information, e.g. an email address, for further\n(subgroup or private) discussion.\nMeta-comments about the use of learning objects or the community facilities are\nrequired more generally, allowing the exchange of knowledge and experience at a\nmore generic level (e.g., How do we reuse materials in our organization?) and\nsupporting the establishment of a community of practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991). A\ntypical approach in an online community is to organize moderated, asynchronous\ndiscussion forums connected to synchronous events like conferences, workshops, or\ninvited addresses.\nTools that support collaboration between members who have some common inter-\nest and will typically establish a subgroup in the community are shared workspaces\n(e.g., BSCW, 2003) and synchronous collaboration tools (e.g., shared whiteboard,\nversion controlled joint editing of documents).\nUse cases to realize exchange in a community\nNeeds assessment.   The needs of the members must be assessed at a regular basis, to\nimprove the usability and the overall functionality of the exchange system.\nManage and apply policies.   One of the central use cases involves managing and\napplying policies. As the name suggests it contains three elements: keeping record\nof the policies in the community; providing mechanisms to apply these policies in\nthe community; and providing policy-regulated mechanisms to change these\npolicies. The policies include aspects as: intellectual property rights; terms of use;\n 30\n \nR. Koper\n \n et al.\n    membership; joining or leaving requirements; the reward system; learning technol-\nogy standards to be used in the community; quality control mechanisms; regula-\ntions for member participation (assessments, voting, peer-review); and regulations\nfor subgroups and role changes (e.g., facilitator). To apply the policies, members\nmust formally agree with the policies. The concrete regulations a person has to\nagree upon can differ depending on the user role and responsibilities. There must\nbe a control mechanism that makes members behave according to the policies. This\ncontrol mechanism can be implemented by assigning responsibilities to a member\nrole, by establishing some social control mechanisms and\/or a by technological\nmeasures, e.g., by setting user rights. There are several reasons to change policies,\none of which is the monitoring of the emergent properties. When the frequency of\nexchange is low, exchanged learning objects have poor quality or, for example, there\nare systematic conflicts between participants (lack of trust), this can trigger a change\nin policies. Changing policies is one of the major control instruments in self-orga-\nnized systems.\nDifferent policy aspects (quality, review) were already discussed in the theoretical\npart of this article. Two more issues will be addressed here: the intellectual property\nrights and the user roles\/rights. In the field of digital rights management (DRM),\ncurrently two models are in force. From the recording and movie industries, the\nmodel of \u2018Enforced DRM\u2019 is promoted. The model of \u2018Attributed DRM\u2019 is promoted\nby educational organizations worldwide and is supported by the IEEE (DR, 2003).\nIn this model, which supports current practices, usage of material is permitted either\nby payment or by simply attributing through layers that are added to the material\n(metadata or digital rights expression language\u2014DREL). From an organizational\npoint of view it is advisable to put some people in charge of tracking the information\non the fast evolving fields of DRM and the implementation of DRM-policies.\nCreating a greater \u2018digital rights\u2019 awareness amongst colleagues should also part of\ntheir job (see also CEN\/ISSS, 2003).\nAnother mechanism to control the monitoring of policies in an electronic environ-\nment is by setting user roles and rights. When a member\u2019s role is changing, the\nassigned user rights can be set automatically in the system. These rights pertain to\naccess to certain functions and data, and the ability to read, edit and upload. For\ninstance, setting the rights for a community facilitator could pertain to editing\nthe policies. Given the fact that policies are the major control mechanisms for self-\norganization and that user rights can be seen as an implementation of the policies in\nelectronic environments, it can be argued that the major control mechanism in an\nlearning object exchange community is the definition and setting of user roles and\nconnected rights.\nInformation, promotion and training.   As stated in the section on background theories,\nthe fact that a good exchange system is available does not guarantee its usage. For an\norganization the possibilities of sharing and reuse of resources should first and fore-\nmost lead to cost-reduction. Such benefits are not always obvious to teachers who\n Building communities for the exchange of learning objects:\n \n31have to do the job. If this change in (working) attitude is not managed and guided\nadequately, organizations will face the danger of reluctant teachers who will do\nanything to undermine these changes (McNaught, 2003). This is a difficult motiva-\ntion issue, as explained by social exchange theory. Given this problem, it is necessary\nto give special attention to activities like: \n1. attracting new members, mainly by communicating the purpose and policies (e.g.,\nthe reward system);\n2. promoting use within the existing membership (e.g., promoting use of particular\nlearning objects) and providing facilities to advertise personal productions;\n3. providing training facilities for new and existing members and overcoming barriers\nat the personal level, like the \u2018not-invented-here\u2019 syndrome or the \u2018free-rider\u2019\neffect.\nImproving collaboration between actors is one of the most important challenges in\nestablishing a learning object exchange community. To make a start with effective\ncollaboration, a number of basic conditions need to be taken care of, including a\ncommon organizational structure, common tools for employers and common goals\n(Wetterling & Collis, 2003). A number of issues need to be addressed, recognized and\nguided alongside these basic conditions. For example, will a teacher be able to\npreserve his own teaching style, or does he need to conform to that of \u2018the group\u2019?\nWill teachers be given enough time, support and guidance in order to make the\n(work) attitude change? It will be necessary for the organization to point out to the\nteachers that the challenge of reuse is exciting and not stressful. For some, this will\nrequire a change of attitude.\nWith respect to the not-invented-here-syndrome, people still tend to think that\nsomething made elsewhere cannot be as good as that which is homemade. It may\nprove to be helpful for authors\/developers to explain what they have made and how\nthey use it (e.g., SoURCE, 2003).\n\u2018Free-riding\u2019 (Olson, 1965) or \u2018lurking\u2019 occurs when people never contribute or\ncease to contribute to a community. In most of these cases, knowledge is not acknowl-\nedged as a public good that is the responsibility of a group, but becomes a good that\ncan be taken and used. The community thus suffers from a social dilemma. Members\nof a community need to be motivated to contribute. As social exchange theory states,\npeople make comparisons between two alternatives and select the alternative\nmost beneficial for themselves, ensuring the lowest costs (Thibaut & Kelly, 1959).\nEmpirical evidence has proved that when group size increases, the proportion of\nvolunteers that contribute decreases (Fischer & Ackerman, 1998). While this might\nbe true for communities in environments other than the web, there is also empirical\nevidence that \u2018virtual communities\u2019 behave differently in this respect (Hemetsberger,\n2003). The LINUX and Apache open-source communities are leading examples of\ncommunities that are successful in enabling a relatively large number of members to\nshare knowledge and contribute to a growing array of software-products. These\ncommunities also substantiate research findings that communities should always\ngather around a common interest or goal (Kozinets, 1999).\n 32\n \nR. Koper\n \n et al.\n    Manage usability.   In the community it is necessary to set up mechanisms to monitor\nthe usability of the system. A needs analysis can identify usability problems, but other\napproaches are also possible, such as a facility that counts errors or frequency of use of\ncertain facilities. Actions to increase usability almost always involve some\n(re-)programming activities and (re-)design of the user-interface. It is important to\nhave capacity available to create the improvements needed.\nConclusion\nIn this article we presented a framework that summarizes the functional and non-\nfunctional requirements for the exchange of learning objects in a community. The\nframework is based on self-organization theory, social-exchange theory, community\nbuilding models, and interoperability specifications for learning objects. The non-\nfunctional requirements are presented in Table 1, and the functional requirements\nare captured in a use case represented in Figure 1. We propose recommendations on\nthree consecutive levels: to use open standards and specifications to code, aggregate\nand identify the different learning objects; to build upon certain use cases to enable\nthe actual exchange of the learning objects at a technological level; and to establish a\ncommunity of practice based on self-organization principles to create an effective\nenvironment for exchange. Above and beyond these recommendations, the most\ncritical aspect in self-organized systems is to establish interactions between partici-\npants that are governed according to some rules, or policies as they are called in this\narticle. These rules are comparable with the rules of games like chess, laws in a society\nor by-laws in an association.\nThe article only provides some suggestions to establish these rules or policies, but\none line of future research should focus on the optimization of policies to establish\nsuccessful exchange systems. For instance, an experimental comparison of certain\nreward policies in a community might provide some useful insights to this optimization\nproblem. Working in communities might also be intrinsically rewarding. Submitting\na learning object, then \u2018experiencing\u2019 peer reviews and working further towards a final\nversion of the object might work in ways similar to the reviewing process that guides\nthe writing of journal articles. In domains like economics and social psychology,\nsuccessful reward systems have appeared to be successfully applied, but we still have\nto search for the adequate combinations of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards that will\nestablish a successful exchange community in the educational arena.\nBesides the reward system the specific organization, e.g. the roles and responsibilities,\ncan be the object of a second line of more detailed research. What type of organizational\nstructure works best and under what conditions? For instance, there is a difference\nbetween the establishment of an exchange system within an existing organization (e.g.,\nuniversity, department, eUniversity, company) based on the idea that only persons that\nwork for the organisation will share there resources, as opposed to an exchange system\nwith an open admission that can be used by everybody who wants to and is able to use it.\nAs a third line of future research we envisage developing an evaluation instrument\nbased on the requirements framework provided in this article. With such an instrument\n Building communities for the exchange of learning objects:\n \n33\n                                we will be able to evaluate and compare concretely implemented initiatives and provide\nsuggestions for their improvement. Such an instrument would establish a minimal set\nof requirements, and weigh the different requirements for learning object exchange\nenvironments. And last but not least, it would provide a starting point for the devel-\nopment of new exchange communities.\nExchanging learning objects within the context of communities seems a potential\nstep towards an affordable e-learning future. Because of the potential quality and cost\nimpact upon education, it is extremely important to continue further research, devel-\nopment and implementation this area. This research should combine a further\ndefinition of necessary standards, the development of sound, specific models and\npolicies for exchange, and the building of facilitative tools and infrastructures that\nenable the exchange of learning objects in communities.\nReferences\nAnderson, W., Challagalla, G. & McFarland, R.
