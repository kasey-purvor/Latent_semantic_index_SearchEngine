This has \nbeen attributed to agricultural improvement, in particular practices such as re-seeding, \ninorganic fertiliser application, improved drainage and changes to cutting and grazing \nregimes (Crofts & Jefferson, 1999; Walker et al., 2004).  These declines have \nprompted considerable interest in the development of new management practices for \nthe restoration of biodiversity on agriculturally improved grasslands (Bakker &  \nBerendse, 1999).   \nWhile re-establishing the flora is normally seen as the key to grassland \nrestoration (Bakker &  Berendse, 1999; Walker et al., 2004), the consideration of \nother trophic levels has the potential to provide valuable additional information when \nassessing restoration success (WallisDeVries &  Raemakers, 2001; Davis et al., 2002; \nPerner &  Malt, 2003; P\u00f6yry et al., 2005; Ottonetti et al., 2006; Woodcock et al., \n2006; Woodcock et al., 2008).  For example, in addition to their host plants \nphytophagous insect are likely to require a suite of suitable environmental conditions \nto successfully establish once they have successfully colonised (WallisDeVries & \nRaemakers, 2001; P\u00f6yry et al., 2005; Woodcock et al., 2006).    \nHere, we consider how the restoration of a primary consumer trophic level is \naffected by management practices targeted at restoring plant communities.  We focus \non a group of morphologically and functionally diverse phytophagous beetles \n(Woodcock et al., 2006; Woodcock et al., 2008).   We test two predictions:  1) The re-\nestablishment of host plants \u2013 promoted by the management practices of hay \nspreading and soil disturbance \u2013 will indirectly result in an increase in similarity of \nphytophagous beetles to target species-rich chalk grassland; 2) Following the \n 4 \nestablishment of suitable host plants subsequent colonization and persistence of \nbeetles will be mediated by individual species traits, that will ultimately act to limit \nrates of restoration for these grassland communities.   \n \nMethods \n \nStudy site and experimental design \n \nThe experiment was established during 1998 on 1.8 ha of agriculturally \nimproved chalk grassland at Brush Hill, Buckinghamshire, UK (lat 51\u02da43\u201927\u201d N, long \n0\u02da48\u201946\u201d W).  Prior to 1998, this grassland had been improved by the application of \nNPK fertiliser, creating a species-poor sward with c. 19 species m\n-2\n of vascular plant.  \nIn addition to the experimental site, an unimproved species-rich chalk grassland \nlocated at Gomm\u2019s Wood (lat 51\u02da37\u201953\u201d N, long 0\u02da42\u201930\u201d W) was used as a donor \nsite for hay used during restoration management (see below) and as a target for \nmeasuring restoration success. Gomm\u2019s Wood was 12.6 km from the experimental \nsite.  \nRestoration of the chalk grassland at Brush Hill was attempted using two \nmanagement practices. The first was soil disturbance, which was intended to create \ngermination niches within the grass sward.  Soil disturbance was created using a \nrotovator; a hand-held petrol driven device used by gardeners.  The second was the \napplication of hay to introduce local provenance seeds from the donor site (Edwards \net al., 2007).  The hay was harvested at Gomm\u2019s Wood in October 1998 and was \napplied within 2 days to experimental plots at 20 tonnes ha\n-1\n.  The four interactions \nbetween hay spreading (\u00b1) and soil disturbance (\u00b1) were tested using a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial \n 5 \nrandomised complete block design.  The four treatments levels were: 1) control with \nno management; 2) hay spreading only; 3) soil disturbance only; 4) hay spreading and \nsoil disturbance.  Each treatment levels was allocated randomly to experimental plots \nwithin each of five replicate blocks (20 experimental plots in total).  Individual \nexperimental plots were 5 \u00d7 5 m, and separated from adjacent plots by 10 m.  Both \nmanagement practices were applied in October 1998 only, with soil disturbance \napplied prior to hay spreading.  Throughout the duration of the study Grazing was \napplied to all experimental plots at rates of between 12 \u2013 15 ewes ha-1.  Grazing was \ninitiated in May of each year until the sward reached a height of 4-7 cm, after which \ngrazing was suspended before being restarted in late August.  This grazing rate \nfollowed recommended stocking densities for UK lowland calcareous grasslands \n(Crofts &  Jefferson, 1999).   \n \nBotanical and beetle sampling \n \nPlant community composition was recorded for all experimental plots in July \nfrom 1999 to 2004.  In the centre of each plot a single 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 m quadrat was \npositioned and the cover abundance of all vascular plant species was recorded.  \nDuring 1998 a further 15 quadrats were sampled from the hay donor site (Gomm\u2019s \nWood) using the same methodology.  \nBeetle sampling was carried out over the same six-year period.  Experimental \nplots were sampled three times a year (May, July and September) using a Vortis \n(Burkhard Ltd, UK) suction sampler. On each occasion, the sampler was placed in 15 \npositions (equivalent to 0.3 m\n2\n), each for 10 seconds, within the same 1 \u00d7 1 m \nquadrats used for the botanical surveys.  Suction sampling is a quantitative method \n 6 \nsuitable for the collection of sward active invertebrates (Southwood &  Henderson, \n2000).  Beetle of the Chrysomelidae, Curculionidae and Apionidae were identified to \nspecies and counts of individuals were summed for the three sampling dates within \neach year.  Using the same methodology 15 suction samples were also taken in May, \nJuly and September 1998 from the hay donor site of Gomm\u2019s Wood.  \n \nMeasuring restoration success \n \nTo test prediction 1 restoration success for the plants and phytophagous \nbeetles were compared in response to the same management practices.  To provide a \nmeasure of restoration success the species composition of the plants and beetles were \ncompared to those of the donor site (Gomm\u2019s wood) using Jaccard\u2019s similarity \ncoefficient (Sj).  This is a binary coefficient that considers only the presence or \nabsence of species (Krebs, 1999) and so considers only species colonisation, not their \npost colonisation abundance.  Jaccard\u2019s similarity was calculated for each of the 20 \nexperimental plots in each year.  In each case similarity was calculated between the \nexperimental plots and each of the 15 samples collected at the Gomm\u2019s Wood donor \nsite to produce an average value.  The choice of Gomm\u2019s Wood as a target \ncommunity for restoration success was based on its status as an unimproved species-\nrich chalk grassland.  \n \nMorphology, colonisation and persistence of the beetles \n \nTo test prediction 2 the phytophagous beetles were classified according to host \nspecificity (monophagous vs. oligophagous \/ polyphagous) and larval feeding strategy \n 7 \n(root-, stem-, foliage- and inflorescence\/seed-feeding) (e.g. Hoffman, 1950-58; \nWoodcock et al., 2006).  Species were also classified as being capable of flight \n(macropterous) or as flightless (brachypterous or apterous).  Average beetle mass for \neach species was determined using Roger et al.\u2019s (1976) mass vs. body length \nequation and was based on mean body lengths of five male and five females.   \nTo determine the effects of these traits on colonisation and persistence over \nthe six years of the study two parameters were calculated for species with 10 or more \nindividuals in the entire data set.  1) Lag time:  This was defined as the mean number \nof years between the establishment of host plants and their colonisation by a beetle \nspecies.  This was calculated for each plot where a beetle species was found.  From \nthis an overall mean lag time was calculated for each beetle species across all \nexperimental plots.  2) Beetle persistence:  This was defined as the probability of a \nbeetle persisting as long as their host plants remained within the experimental plots.  \nThis probability of persistence was calculated as the ratio of the number of \nexperimental plots where a beetle species went extinct before its host plant to the total \nnumber of plots where the beetle was found (out of a maximum of 20).   Both of these \nparameters were derived from information in all 20 experimental plots across all six \nyears and so their analyses will not consider the fixed effects of management or year. \n \nData analyses \n \nPrediction 1 was tested using generalised linear models (GLM) in SAS 9.01.  \nChanges in Jaccard\u2019s similarity of the plants and beetles were tested in response to all \ninteractions of hay spreading (\u00b1 Hay), soil disturbance (\u00b1 Soil) and year \n(Schabenberger &  Pierce, 2002).  Year was considered as a continuous variable in \n 8 \nthis analysis, and block was included as a covariate.  To account for repeated \nmeasurements taken within each experimental plot the effects of block, soil, hay, and \nsoil \u00d7 hay were tested against the mean square error term of block \u00d7 hay \u00d7 soil.  Based \non analyses of the distribution of residuals this GLM used a normal error structure and \nidentity link function  (Schabenberger &  Pierce, 2002).  Non-significant treatment \neffects were deleted from this maximal model, although the deletion of non-\nsignificant treatment effects that were part of significant interaction terms was not \npermitted. \nPrediction 2 tested for the effects of beetle morphology and feeding habits on \nspecies colonisation and persistence.  The underlying assumption of these analyses \nwas that for phytophagous beetles to become established in experimental plots their \nhost plant had to be present (Woodcock et al., 2006).  The response of colonisation \nlag time to beetle flight (full vs. reduced wings), beetle mass and the interaction \nbetween these factors was tested using GLM\u2019s (Schabenberger &  Pierce, 2002).  \nGLM\u2019s were used to test for the effect of host plant specificity and beetle larval \nfeeding strategy on colonisation lag times.  As species from the same genera often \nshare similar larval feeding strategies it was necessary to account for this potentially \nconfounding effect by including beetle genera as a covariate in this. Where significant \neffects were found, post-hoc Tukey\u2019s tests were performed.  These GLM\u2019s also used a \nnormal error structure and identity link function.  \nThe effect of host plant specificity and larval feeding strategy on the \nprobability of beetle persistence was also tested using GLM\u2019s, using a binomial error \nstructure and logit link function (Schabenberger &  Pierce, 2002).  The binomial error \nstructure was used to account for the lower (0) and upper (1) boundaries associated \nwith probability data.  The confounding effect of beetle genera on the probability of \n 9 \nbeetle persistence\u2019s response to larval feeding strategy was also accounted for by the \ninclusion of this parameter as a covariate. \nFinally, as different beetle species occurred at different abundances within the \ndata set this could have caused systematic biases in lag times and persistence.  The \nextent of this problem was assessed by separately correlating lag time and persistence \nwith beetle abundance.  Both analyses were performed using GLM\u2019s and the error \nstructures indicated above.   \n \nResults \n \nPlant and beetle similarity to the donor site \n \nPrediction 1 was rejected as restoration success for the beetle (as measured by \nJaccard\u2019s similarity to the donor site) in response to the management practices of hay \nspreading and soil disturbance did not mirror that of the plants.  Plant similarity (Sj) to \nthe target grassland community was found to be greatest where hay had been applied, \nalthough this showed no interaction with year (Fig 1).  The increase in similarity to \nthe target grassland in response to hay spreading was, however, relatively small (c. 2-\n3 %).  Neither block, nor any other individual term or interaction between year, soil \ndisturbance or hay spreading influenced plant similarity (Table 1).   In contrast to the \nplants, the similarity of the beetles to the target grassland was positively correlated \nwith the number of years since restoration began, showing a c. 5 % increase over the \nsix years (Table 1, Fig 2).  However, no other significant individual or interaction \nterms were found.    \n \n 10 \nBeetle colonisation and persistence \n \nFollowing the rejection of prediction 1 the effect of beetle traits on \ncolonisation and persistence during restoration were tested.  Of 6,733 phytophagous \nbeetles identified to 67 species, 27 reached the threshold abundance (N > 10 \nindividuals) for inclusion in the analysis.  Lag times between the establishment of host \nplants and their colonisation were found for all but two beetle species.    \nColonisation lag time was not correlated with the number of individuals \ncollected of each beetle species (F1,25=2.43, p=0.13).  Phytophagous beetles capable \nof flight were found to have significantly reduced colonisation lag times (F1,25=10.0, \np<0.01, R\n2\n=0.29; Fig. 3).  However, neither beetle body mass (F1,24=0.14, p=0.71) nor \nthe interaction between mass and flight (F1,23=0.28, p=0.60) had a significant effect.    \nLarval feeding strategy also significantly influenced colonisation lag times \n(F3,23=12.1, p<0.001; R\n2\n=0.61; Fig. 4), although the covariate coding for beetle genera \nhad no effect (F8,15=1.04, p>0.05).  The shortest lag time was associated with root-\nfeeding strategies, and the longest with the foliage feeders.  Colonisation lag time was \nnot dependent on the degree of host plant specificity (monophagous vs. oligophagous \/ \npolyphagous) shown by the beetles (F1,25=1.12, p=0.30). \nOut of the 27 species considered, only two were always found to persist as \nlong as their host plants.  In contrast to colonisation lag times, the probability of \nbeetles persisting as long as their host plants was positively correlated with individual \nspecies abundance (F1,25=11.0, p>0.01).  Individual species abundance was thereafter \nincluded as a covariate in subsequent analyses of beetle persistence to account for this \nbias.  Host plant specificity did not predict the probability of beetles persisting as long \nas their host plants (F1,24=1.12, p=0.30).  However, larval feeding strategy did have a \n 11 \nsignificant effect on beetle persistence (F3,22=4.12, p<0.05; Fig. 5), although the \nconfounding effect of beetle genera did not (F8,14=5.82, p>0.05). Beetles with \nconcealed larval feeding strategies (i.e. root-, stem- or inflorescence \/ seed-feeding) \nwere more likely to persist within the sward than the foliage feeding species. \n \nDiscussion   \n \nWhile the addition of seeds within hay overcomes limitations associated with \nthe remnant seed bank of the restoration site for the plants (Walker et al., 2004), this \neffect was not mirrored for the phytophagous beetles.  The rejection of prediction 1 \ndemonstrates that the establishment of host plants alone does not represent the only \nfactor limiting restoration success for the phytophagous beetles.   This finding \nindicates that simply restoring the plants will not necessarily result in the restoration \nof other trophic levels, and the ability of species to colonize and subsequently persist \nare factors of key importance.  There are a variety of factors which may act to limit \nthe successful establishment of beetle species, for example local suitability of \nmicroclimate (Davis et al., 2002; Perner &  Malt, 2003), cutting and grazing regimes \n(WallisDeVries &  Raemakers, 2001; P\u00f6yry et al., 2005; Woodcock et al., 2006) and \npatch quality (Bonte et al., 2003; Krauss et al., 2005).  Landscape scale effects such as \nisolation are also likely to limit colonisation, both for the plants as well as insects in \ngeneral (Tscharntke &  Brandl, 2004).  However, while hay spreading can be used to \novercome dispersal limitation issues for the plants (Willems, 2001; Walker et al., \n2004; Edwards et al., 2007), there exists no equivalent management practice to \nachieve the same goal for the beetles.  That said, it was possible that some individuals \nwere transferred via the hay (Wagner, 2004), although given the fragility of \n 12 \ninvertebrates mortality resulting from such a dispersal mechanism would be likely to \nbe high.  While mechanisms that restrict rates of colonisation and establishment have \nbeen widely investigated for plants (e.g. Soons &  Heil, 2002; Pywell et al., 2003), \nthey often remain poorly understood for the invertebrates (Ottonetti et al., 2006).  \n  For the beetles, restoration success increased with the number of years since \nrestoration was initiated, independently of the management practices.  This suggests \nthat the establishment of species is a gradual process reflecting colonisation from \nsource populations present in other grasslands within the local landscape (Bonte et al., \n2003; Tscharntke & Brandl, 2004; Krauss et al., 2005).  Ultimately the establishment \nof phytophagous species will be limited by their requirements for suitable host plants.  \nGiven the greater plant similarity of the hay spreading treatments to the target \ngrassland community, it was expected that similarity for the beetles would continue to \nincrease for the hay spreading treatment after that of the control had levelled off.  \nHowever, there is no evidence for this over the six year period, suggesting that such a \ndivergence point has not yet occurred, possibly reflecting slow rates of colonisation \nfor the beetles.  Given that the difference in similarity for the plants between the hay \nspreading and control treatments were small (c. 2-3 %) such a divergence may be hard \nto detect. \n  While management was not found to have a direct affect on restoration \nsuccess for the beetles, there was strong support for prediction 2 that individual \nspecies traits were responsible for mediating colonisation and persistence during \nrestoration.   The establishment of host plants is arguably a simple basis for assessing \nhabitat quality, and indeed it is likely that many other factors may play an important \nrole in limiting site suitability for colonisation.  For example, local microclimate in \nrelation to North or South facing slopes, or sensitivity to cutting or grazing regimes \n 13 \n(WallisDeVries & Raemakers, 2001; P\u00f6yry et al., 2005; Woodcock et al., 2006).   \nUltimately, however, niche breadth for the phytophagous beetles will have its limits \nset by the availability of host plants (Woodcock et al., 2008).  \nPerhaps the most obvious morphological trait found to limit colonisation rates \nof the phytophagous beetles was their ability to fly (St Pierre et al., 2005; Woodcock \net al., 2006).  Such evidence for dispersal limitation does highlight the need to \nconsider sites intended for restoration within a landscape context, in particular their \nproximity to existing areas of species-rich chalk grassland (Bakker &  Berendse, \n1999).  Targeting funding aimed at restoration specifically at sites characterised by \nlow levels of isolation may therefore be an efficient was of promoting restoration of \ntrophic levels other than the plants (Bonte et al., 2003; Tscharntke &  Brandl, 2004).  \nWhile neither colonisation lag times nor the persistence of beetles within the \nexperimental plots was influenced by the degree of host plant specificity \n(monophagous vs. oligophagous \/ polyphagous), this was not the case for larval \nfeeding strategy.  In general, species that fed in a concealed manner, in particular \nwithin roots or plant stems, were more likely to colonise host plants and subsequently \npersist on them once established.  The poor colonisation and persistence of beetles \nwith larvae feeding on exposed plant structures, principally the foliage, may have \nbeen caused by damage to these structures resulting from grazing management. \nHowever, as this study did not specifically test the effects of grazing intensity its \neffects of colonisation and persistence rates can only be supposition.  \nSampling for both the plants and the beetles within this study was limited to a \nrelatively small area (1 m\n2\n) within each experimental plot.  This has potential \nimplications for the measurements of similarity made between the experimental plots \nand the target grassland.  Similarity will be affected not only by the species \n 14 \ncomposition of plants and insects, but also by the underlying distribution of plant and \ninsect species, the extent of conspecific aggregation and sample size (Plotkin &  \nMuller-Landau, 2002).   While the sample areas within each experimental plot \nrepresented 4.0 % of the overall area of each plot, it is probable that different patterns \nof similarity with the target grassland may have been encountered had sampling \noccurred at different spatial scales or had larger sampling areas been used.  In addition \nto this issue, the reference community of plants and phytophagous beetles was only \nsurveyed once in the six-year period.  Given that it was unlikely that the composition \nof plants and beetles of this grassland were to remain static from year to year, the \nvalidity of this community as a target for measuring restoration success may have \nlimitations (Crofts & Jefferson, 1999; Willems, 2001).  However, the target grassland \ncommunity was sufficiently dissimilar to the experimental plots so that yearly \nvariation in its community structure was not unlikely to be large enough to distort the \noverall patterns of restoration success described.   \nIn conclusion, it appears that while soil disturbance and hay spreading were \nnot of direct importance in the restoration of chalk grassland phytophagous beetles, \nthe colonization and subsequent persistence of individual species was found to be a \nfunction of individual species traits.  This effect reflects similar findings in studies \ninvestigating species invasion into new communities, where species traits can be used \nto predict establishment (e.g. Duyck et al., 2007; Ward &  Masters, 2007). \nImportantly, competitive ability can play as important a role as colonisation and thus \nthe long term persistence of species (Duyck et al., 2007), a factor not directly \nconsidered here.  Ultimately, the rate at which beetles were able to colonise grasslands \nduring restoration represents a limiting factor to the successful enhancement of \nbiodiversity on agriculturally improved grassland.  Interestingly, it seems that the \n 15 \nestablishment of host plants represent only the most basic requirement for the \nrestoration of phytophagous insects.  Factors that influence the capacity of individual \nspecies to colonise and persist may therefore be acting as an additional filter limiting \nwhat assemblage of phytophagous beetles that ultimately becomes established.  \nUnderstanding what these limitations are provide a first step to developing \nmanagement strategies that can be used to overcome them and so promote restoration \nsuccess in these chalk grasslands.  \n \nImplications for Practice \n \n  Increased similarity of plants to target species-rich chalk grasslands during \nrestoration was achieved by introducing seeds within green hay.  \n Similarity of phytophagous beetles to the target grassland was not influenced \nby either hay spreading or soil disturbance, but it did increase over time.  \n Evidence for dispersal limitation highlighted the need to consider sites \nintended for restoration within a landscape context, in particular their \nproximity to existing areas of unimproved species-rich chalk grassland may be \nvital to achieve restoration success. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis work was funded by Defra (BD1414 and BD1441).
