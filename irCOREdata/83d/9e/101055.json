INTRODUCTION\nAfter nearly 15 years of systematic search, new \u201cislands\u201d\nof superdeformation (SD) have been found in the nuclear chart\naround the A \u0001 40 mass region (e.g., 36Ar [1] and 40Ca [2]).\nSurprisingly, these light and symmetric (i.e., N = Z) nuclei in\nthe latest SD \u201carchipelago\u201d are magic and near-magic systems,\nwhose ground states have a spherical shape.\nThese light nuclear systems with magic and near-magic\nnumbers need cross-shell excitations, involving both the sd\nand pf shells, in order to produce the collective degrees of\nfreedom necessary for the formation of SD states. The cor-\nresponding shell-model space becomes inevitably very large.\nHowever, modern high-performance computation systems are\nquickly advancing to allow shell-model diagonalization to\nbe executed if the minimum and reasonable truncations are\njustified in the model space.\nMean-field descriptions have a numerical advantage in\nreducing the dimension over exact diagonalization, owing to\nthe ansatz for a many-body wave function (for example, the\nSlater determinant in the Hartree-Fock theory). The mean-field\napproach was exclusively applied [3] to the early studies of\nSD states known before 2000 [4], such as in the A \u0001 80 (e.g.,\n84Zr44 [5]), A \u0001 150 (e.g., 152Dy86 [6]), and A \u0001 190 (e.g.,\n194Hg114 [7]) mass regions. The main reason is that nuclei\nin these SD archipelagoes belong to heavy- and medium-\nweight classes. They are still out of reach of the shell-model\ndiagonalization approach using the full model space in the\nrelevant valence shells. The mean-field method has other\nadvantages, particularly related to the intuitive understanding\nof many-body systems, such as nuclear deformation and\nnuclear superconductivity.\nAt present, it is true to say that neither mean-field\ncalculations nor truncated shell-model diagonalizations are\ndominantly superior to their counterpart. They are comple-\nmentary at the moment. Many theoretical studies using these\ntwo approaches followed after the experimental reports were\npublished on 36Ar and 40Ca.\n*m.oi@surrey.ac.uk\nShell-model diagonalizations were performed by Svensson\net al. [1], Caurier et al. [8,9], and Poves [10], with the\nremoval of the d5\/2 orbital from the sd-pf shells and with the\ncorresponding effective interaction. Recently, they attempted\nto give a consistent description of the SD and normal deformed\nstates in 40Ca [9]. These calculations with the truncation\nwere very successful in reproducing the experimental energy\nspectra.\nThe first attempt through the mean-field approach was\ncarried out with the cranked Nilsson model in the original\npaper [1]. In the 40Ca paper [2], the cranked RMF (relativistic\nmean-field) method was applied. Both of the methods ignored\nthe pairing correlation, so the energy spectra of the low-spin\nmembers (J <\u223c 10h\u00af) in the SD bands were not well reproduced.\nLong and Sun [11] then applied the projected shell model\n(PSM). In this model, bases are produced through angular mo-\nmentum projection onto the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB)\nstates, obtained with the P+Q\u00b7Q two-body interaction [11].\nA merit in this framework is that the pairing correlation\nis properly treated. As a consequence, a better agreement\nwas obtained with the experimental data. However, the\ncalculation was restricted to an axial symmetric shape (with the\ndeformation parameter fixed all the way from low- to high-spin\nregions), so the shape evolution of the system, particularly the\ntriaxial degree of freedom in response to the Coriolis force,\ncannot be discussed in this model.\nVariable deformation is an important degree of freedom in\na rapidly rotating nucleus. For example, the band termination\nphenomenon for the SD band is predicted by the cranked Nils-\nson model, which gives a continuous evolution in triaxiality\ntoward the non-collective oblate deformation (\u03b3 = \u221260\u25e6) in\nthe band limit.1 Inakura et al. applied the cranked Skyrme\nHartree-Fock (HF) method, which does not restrict nuclear\nshapes unlike the PSM, but the pairing correlation was ignored\n[12]. Bender, Flocard, and Heenen analyzed the SD bands\nin the A \u0001 40 region by means of the most sophisticated\nmethod, the generator coordinate method (GCM), with the\nprojected Skyrme HF+BCS states [13]. The Lipkin-Nogami\n1The sign convention for \u03b3 in this study is opposite to the so-called\nLund convention.\n0556-2813\/2007\/76(4)\/044308(15) 044308-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nMAKITO OI PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 044308 (2007)\nmethod and particle number projection were applied, so the\npairing was properly treated. Although nuclear shape can\nvary through the constraint on the quadrupole moment, only\naxial deformation was assumed in the calculation. In addition,\nthe analyses were restricted only to low-spin states (J \u0001 6h\u00af),\nbecause the states with nonzero angular momentum were only\nkinematically created through angular momentum projection\n(without cranking). A dynamical effect originating from shape\ncoexistence was considered through the GCM, but the method\nunderestimated the more important dynamical effect coming\nfrom the Coriolis force, which plays a major role at high spin.\nThe aim of this paper is thus to test another mean-field\napproach, which can handle the pairing correlation, the\nCoriolis force, and the evolution of nuclear shape (in particular,\ntriaxiality) in a fully self-consistent manner, for the full sd-pf\nmodel space. For this purpose, this work analyzes the SD\nbands in 36Ar (a case with backbending) and 40Ca (a case\nwithout backbending) using the P+Q\u00b7Q model based on the\nHFB method [14].\nII. THE P+Q\u00b7Q MODEL OF SELF-CONSISTENT\nCRANKING CALCULATION\nIn the current framework, the Hamiltonian contains two\nterms,\n\u02c6H = \u02c6H0 + \u02c6V . (1)\nThe first term \u02c6H0 represents the one-body term, and it is\nthe spherical Nilsson Hamiltonian. In the second quantization\nnotation, it is expressed as\n\u02c6H0 =\n\u2211\nm\nema\n\u2020\nmam, (2)\nwhere a pair of operators (a\u2020m, am) denotes fermionic operators\nof creation and annihilation. This part is solved exactly\n\u02c6H0|\u03c8m\u3009 = em|\u03c8m\u3009, (3)\nand the eigenstates {|\u03c8m\u3009 \u2261 a\u2020m|0\u3009} (the spherical Nilsson\nstates) are used as the basis in the following stages. Index\nm collectively denotes the quantum numbers in the Nilsson\nmodel, that is, (nlj\u0003), as well as isospin and parity. A time-\nreversal state of m is denoted as m\u00af. We use the notation m > 0,\nwhich means (nlj ; \u0003 > 0). In this case, its time-reversal state\nm\u00af corresponds to (nlj ; \u2212\u0003). The so-called Nilsson parameters\nfor the spin-orbit and orbit-orbit forces (denoted as \u03ba and \u00b5 in\nthe standard notation) are taken from Refs. [15,16].\nThe second term \u02c6V represents the two-body part and is the\nP+Q\u00b7Q interaction in this study,\n\u02c6V = \u22121\n2\n\u03c7\n2\u2211\n\u00b5=\u22122\n\u02c6Q\u2020\u00b5 \u02c6Q\u00b5 \u2212\n\u2211\n\u03c4=p,n\nG\u03c4 \u02c6P\n\u2020\n\u03c4\n\u02c6P\u03c4 , (4)\nwhere the first and second terms correspond to the particle-\nhole and particle-particle channels of the two-body interaction,\nrespectively. The former interaction is responsible for the long-\nrange correlation to describe nuclear deformation, while the\nlatter is for the short-range correlation to handle the nuclear\npairing. The quadrupole operator and the monopole pairing\noperator are, respectively, given as\n\u02c6Q\u00b5 =\n\u2211\nmn\n(Q\u00b5)mna\u2020man, (5)\n\u02c6P\u03c4 =\n\u2211\nm(\u2208\u03c4 )>0\nam\u00afam. (6)\nThe Hamiltonian is \u201cdiagonalized\u201d with the basis \u03c8m\nby means of the mean-field approximation. It corresponds\nto a procedure to extract one-body ingredients, \u02c6VMF, from\nthe two-body interaction, \u02c6V , so as to diagonalize \u02c6VMF. The\nresidual part, \u02c6VR = \u02c6V \u2212 \u02c6VMF, is therefore neglected in the\napproximation.\nRemembering that we take the pairing correlation into\naccount, the HFB ansatz is employed in the variational\ncalculations; that is,\n|HFB\u3009 =\n\u220f\np\n\u03b2p|0\u3009. (7)\nThe quasiparticle annihilation-creation operators (\u03b2p, \u03b2\u2020p) are\nrelated to the original annihilation-creation operators (am, a\u2020m)\nthrough the Bogoliubov transformation,(\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\u2020\n)\n=\n(\nU V \u2217\nV U \u2217\n)(\na\na\u2020\n)\n. (8)\nMatrix elements U and V in the Bogoliubov transformation\ncorrespond to the variational parameters in the HFB theory.\nThe density matrix \u03c1 and the pairing tensor \u03ba are introduced\nhere as\n\u03c1mn = \u3008HFB|a\u2020nam|HFB\u3009 = (V \u2217V T )mn, (9)\n\u03bamn = \u3008HFB|anam|HFB\u3009 = (V \u2217UT )mn. (10)\nThe mean-field approximation of the Hamiltonian thus reads\n\u02c6HHFB = EHFB +\n\u2211\np\nEp\u03b2\n\u2020\np\u03b2p\n= EHFB +\n\u2211\nmn\nhmna\n\u2020\nman +\n\u2211\n\u03c4=p,n\n\u2211\nmn\u2208\u03c4\n\t\u03c4mnaman + h.c.\n(11)\nThe one-body component in the particle-hole (ph) channel,\nrepresented as h, has the following form.\nh = e + \n (12)\nThe first term (e)ij = \u03b4ij ei represents the spherical Nilsson\nenergy. The second term \n is called the self-consistent\npotential,\n\nmn =\n2\u2211\n\u00b5=\u22122\nq\u00b5(Q\u00b5)mn, (13)\nwhere the self-consistent coefficient q\u00b5 is given as\nq\u00b5 = \u2212\u03c7Tr(\u03c1Q\u00b5). (14)\nThe coupling constant \u03c7 is determined in the standard manner\nby comparing to the axially deformed Nilsson model with\ndeformation \u03b20 in the beginning of the variational calculation.\n044308-2\nDESCRIPTION OF SUPERDEFORMED BANDS IN LIGHT . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 044308 (2007)\nThe one-body component in the particle-particle (pp)\nchannel, denoted as \t in Eq. (11), describes the pairing\ncorrelation. It has the form\n\t\u03c4mn = 12p\u2217\u03c4 (P\u03c4 )mn (\u03c4 = p, n), (15)\nwhere the pairing matrix element (P\u03c4 )mn is determined from\nEq. (6) and the self-consistent pairing coefficient p\u03c4 is\nexpressed as\np\u03c4 = \u2212G\u03c4\n\u2211\nm(\u2208\u03c4 )>0\n\u03bamm\u00af. (16)\nThe pairing-gap energy \u00af\t is defined as the average of the\nmatrix elements of \t, that is,\n\u00af\t\u03c4 \u2261 1\nM \u2032\nM \u2032\u2211\nm(\u2208\u03c4 )>0\n\t\u03c4mm\u00af, (17)\nwhere M \u2032 = M\/2 is the half the dimension of a subspace\nof given isospin (\u03c4 ). In the case of the present separable\ninteraction, the expression for the pairing gap is simply given\nas\n\u00af\t\u03c4 = p\u03c4 . (18)\nThe pairing strength G\u03c4 is determined in the standard manner\nby using the Nilsson+BCS calculation with the initial values\nfor the pairing gaps (\t0) together with the \u03b20.\nHigh-spin states are produced with the self-consistent\ncranking model. That is, the variational equation,\n\u03b4\u3008HFB| \u02c6H \u2212 \u03c9 \u02c6Jx \u2212\n\u2211\n\u03c4=p,n\n\u03bb\u03c4 \u02c6N\u03c4 |HFB\u3009 = 0, (19)\nis self-consistently solved by means of the gradient method\nunder the following two constraints:\n\u3008HFB| \u02c6Jx |HFB\u3009 = Tr(\u03c1jx) = J, (20)\nwhere J is the total angular momentum, and\n\u3008HFB| \u02c6N |HFB\u3009 = Tr(\u03c1) = N, (21)\nwhere N is the total particle number.\nIn this study, the usual one-dimensional cranking model\nis implemented, so only one component of the total angular\nmomentum vector is constrained. Quantities \u03c9 and \u03bb\u03c4 in the\nvariational equation are the Lagrange multipliers. The first\nmultiplier is interpreted as the rotational frequency, while\nthe second multiplier stands for the chemical potential. The\npresence of the chemical potential is due to the introduction\nof the BCS-type pairing correlation, which breaks the particle\nnumber conservation. As a result, the mean particle number\nneeds to be constrained in the calculation.\nThe HFB energy EHFB can thus be written as\nEJHFB = \u3008HFB(J )| \u02c6H |HFB(J )\u3009 = Tr(\u03c1h) \u2212\n\u2211\n\u03c4=p,n\n\u00af\t2\u03c4 , (22)\nand this corresponds to the yrast spectrum.\nFor the model space, two major shells (N = 2, 3, or the so-\ncalled sd-pf shell) each for protons and neutrons are used, that\nis, d5\/2, s1\/2, d3\/2 (N = 2); f7\/2, p3\/2, f5\/2, p1\/2 (N = 3). This\nchoice is in accordance with the Kumar-Baranger prescription\nfor the P+Q\u00b7Q force [17]. When a role of an intruder g9\/2\n(N = 4) orbital is discussed, it is also included in the model\nspace.\nFurther details of the method are available in Ref. [14].\nIII. NUMERICAL RESULTS\nTwo N = Z nuclear systems are studied in this paper: 40Ca\nand 36Ar. The former nucleus shows no sign of backbending so\nfar (up to J = 16h\u00af), while the latter has a clear backbending at\nJ = 10h\u00af. With the P+Q\u00b7Q model based on the cranked HFB\napproach, we attempt to describe the superdeformed states in\nthese nuclei in a self-consistent manner in both the ph and pp\n(hh) channels.\nA. A case of no backbending: 40Ca\nThe SD band of 40Ca is so far identified up to J = 16h\u00af [2].\nThis rotational band is regular and no backbending is currently\nobserved.\n1. Role of the d5\/2 orbital\nAs stated above, our model space contains the full sd and\npf shells. It is thus possible to examine, in the framework of the\nself-consistent mean-field calculation, the core-polarization\neffect or the influence coming from the d5\/2 orbital truncated\nin the shell-model calculations. The occupation numbers of\neach single-particle orbital provides us useful information for\nthis purpose.\nBefore analyzing our own calculations, it is worth learning\nthe results obtained by others. In a description of the SD band\nof 40Ca through the shell-model diagonalization by Poves [10],\nthe single-particle model space is set to be s1\/2, d3\/2 (N =\n2); f7\/2, p3\/2, f5\/2, p1\/2 (N = 3). (This choice of the model\nspace was also used for 36Ar.) The d5\/2 orbital is excluded\nfrom the valence space for numerical reasons. Within this\nmodel space (and the corresponding effective interaction), the\n8p-8h configuration, that is, (s1\/2d3\/2)4(fp)8, was proposed for\nthe description of the SD band. The calculated result based on\nthis configuration reproduces the experimental data quite well\nwith a well-tuned effective interaction [1,10]. Long and Sun\nraised the question about the d5\/2 truncation in their paper,\nin which they performed the PSM (projected shell model)\ncalculation [11]. According to their analysis, the d5\/2 orbital\ndoes not contribute to the SD state in 36Ar but to higher excited\nrotational bands. The cranked Nilsson calculation performed\nfor 36Ar [1] is also informative. It was obtained that only about\nhalf a particle in each isospin sector is excited into higher\norbitals from the d5\/2 orbital. Summarizing these results, it\ncan be said that the Poves prescription for the truncation might\nbe a good approximation for a description of the SD band.\nNow, let us turn to our calculation. The initial parameters\nfor the self-consistent iterations are chosen to be \u03b20 = 0.6\nand (\t0p,\t0n) = (1.360, 1.513) MeV. These initial pairing-gap\nenergies are employed from Ref. [18].\nIn Fig. 1, the average occupation numbers, which are\ndiagonal elements of the density matrix \u03c1 are presented as\n044308-3\nMAKITO OI PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 044308 (2007)\n 0\n 0.5\n 1\n 1.5\n 2\n 2.5\n 3\n 0  5  10  15  20\nO\ncc\nup\nat\nio\nn \nNu\nm\nbe\nr\nTotal Angular Momentum\nf 7\/2\nd 3\/2\ns 1\/2\nd 5\/2\n(hole)\np 3\/2\nf 5\/2\np 1\/2\n 0\n 0.5\n 1\n 1.5\n 2\n 2.5\n 3\n 0  5  10  15  20\nO\ncc\nup\nat\nio\nn \nNu\nm\nbe\nr\nTotal Angular Momentum\nf 7\/2\nd 3\/2\ns 1\/2\nd 5\/2\n(hole)\np 3\/2\nf 5\/2\np 1\/2\nFIG. 1.

The right and\nleft panels in the figure show the occupation numbers for\nprotons and neutrons, respectively. The graphs look quite\nsimilar to each other as a consequence of N = Z. Following\nthe presentation in Ref. [1], the occupation in the d5\/2 orbital\nis plotted using the hole occupation number. Our result shows\n(see Table I) that only half a particle is missing from the fully\nfilled d5\/2 orbital, which supports the shell-model truncation by\nPoves. This result is similar to the cranked Nilsson calculation\nfor 36Ar [1]. However, the number increases at higher spin\n(J >\u223c 16h\u00af) to reach to 1 (see Table II), so that the core\npolarization may need to be taken into account, particularly\nat high spin.\nTable I displays the details of the occupation numbers at\nJ = 0. The net occupation number in the d5\/2 orbitals are\n10.93, that is, about one particle (in the isoscalar basis) is\nexcited into upper orbitals, as already mentioned above. The\ntotal numbers of the occupation in the subspace (s1\/2 d3\/2)\nand the pf shell (f7\/2 p3\/2 f5\/2 p1\/2) are about five and\neight, respectively. In other words, our calculation suggests\n(d5\/2)\u22121(d3\/2 s1\/2)5(fp)8 for the band-head structure of the SD\nband. To a good extent, this configuration is consistent with\nthe 8p-8h structure proposed in the shell-model calculation.\nAlthough our calculation indicates a possible core polarization,\nthis effect can be minor at low spin.\nTable II shows the occupation numbers at J = 18h\u00af.

For this purpose, the g9\/2 orbital is added to the\nmodel space in the present framework, and the calculation is\nrepeated with the pairing force being unchanged. The result is\nplotted with a line denoted as HFB-Gp in Fig. 3. The low-spin\nbehavior is almost identical to the previous case (HFB-Np),\nthat is, without the g9\/2 orbital.

The occupation numbers are also plotted in\nFig. 4, which shows only slight differences from Fig. 1. It\nlooks as though the inclusion of the g9\/2 orbital has only a\nminor influence on the nuclear structure, but it turns out to\nbe quite essential to the high-spin nuclear structure of 40Ca,\nthrough the subsequent analyses. We will come back to this\nargument in connection with backbending.\n3. Effect of pairing correlation and backbending\nAn effect of the pairing correlation can be also studied\nhere. Our approach is to compare two cases: with and\nwithout pairing. The case without pairing is constructed\nby choosing the initial pairing-gap energies to be small:\n(\t0p,\t0n) = (0.150, 0.150) [MeV]. With this choice, the gap\nenergies disappear as early as J \u0001 0.1h\u00af and remain so at higher\nspin. This calculation is essentially the Hartree-Fock (HF)\ncalculation without pairing, such as the cranked RMF [2] and\ncranked Skyrme HF [12].\nThe rotational energies in Fig. 3 denoted HFB-Nn and\nHFB-Gn correspond to the case with and without the g9\/2\norbital, respectively (both cases are without pairing). As seen\nin the figure, there is not much difference between these two\ncases, but both of them underestimate the experimental data.\nWhen the pairing is adequately taken into account (HFB-Np\nand HFB-Gp), there is a plateau structure in the graph at\nthe low-spin region, which brings better agreement with the\nexperimental data. However, when the pairing correlations\nare absent, the plateau structure disappears and the steeper\ncurves appear. Similar results were obtained in the other\nmean-field calculations neglecting the pairing correlation, such\nas the cranked RMF model [2] and the cranked Skyrme\nHF calculation [12]. In the case of 36Ar, the shell-model\ncalculation [1] and the PSM [11] reproduce the experimental\ndata fairly well, and the plateau structure is seen in these\ncalculations. These results suggest the importance of the higher\norder correlations in the two-body interaction beyond the\nmean-field level. However, our calculation also implies that an\ninclusion of the pp-channels in the mean-field approximation,\nthat is, the pairing correlations, seem to \u201csalvage\u201d effectively\nthe important correlations that the ph-channels in the mean-\nfield approximation fail to pick up. To support this remark,\ndiscrepancies in the excitation energy start to happen (which is\nof the order of about 1 MeV), after the gap energies disappear\nat J >\u223c 6\u20137h\u00af (see Figs. 3 and 5, as well as the subsequent\ndiscussion in the following paragraph).\nFigure 5 displays the calculated pairing-gap energies\nfor protons and neutrons with the original initial values\nfor (\t0p,\t0n) = (1.360, 1.513) MeV. In either case, the gap\nenergies disappear at J >\u223c 8h\u00af, which is roughly consistent with\nthe point at which the deviation in the calculated excitation\nenergy can be seen in Fig. 3. In finite systems, the pairing\ncorrelation should persist even at high spin, as in Fig. 2(d)\nin Ref. [11]. This \u201ccollapse\u201d of the pairing is a notorious\nproblem in the BCS-type theory applied to a finite system,\nand this \u201cphase transition\u201d of the pairing gap is known to be a\nmere artifact of the model. In reality, nuclear systems should\nundergo a crossover or a gradual decrease in the pairing gap.\nIn the present work, the disappearance of the calculated gap\n044308-5\nMAKITO OI PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 044308 (2007)\n 0\n 0.5\n 1\n 1.5\n 2\n 2.5\n 3\n 0  5  10  15  20\nO\ncc\nup\nat\nio\nn \nNu\nm\nbe\nr\nTotal Angular Momentum\nf 7\/2\nd 3\/2\ns 1\/2\nd 5\/2(hole)\np 3\/2\ng 9\/2\nf 5\/2\np 1\/2\n 0\n 0.5\n 1\n 1.5\n 2\n 2.5\n 3\n 0  5  10  15  20\nO\ncc\nup\nat\nio\nn \nNu\nm\nbe\nr\nTotal Angular Momentum\nf 7\/2\nd 3\/2\ns 1\/2\nd 5\/2(hole)\np 3\/2\ng 9\/2\nf 5\/2\np 1\/2\nFIG. 4.

However,\na more elaborate treatment to keep the pairing correlation is\nnecessary for more accurate descriptions at high spin, such as\nthe Lipkin-Nogami method [20].\nSo far, no backbending has been reported in the SD band of\n40Ca (until J = 16h\u00af), and our calculation is consistent with\nthis observation (with or without an inclusion of the g9\/2\norbital). The shell-model calculation by Poves also reproduced\nthis result. Interestingly, the shell-model calculation predicts\nthe backbending at higher spin (J \u0001 20h\u00af) [10]. This angular\nmomentum corresponds to the band termination for the 8p-8h\nconfiguration, that is, (d3\/2 s1\/2)4(f7\/2)8. According to Poves,\nthe nuclear structure after the backbending is constructed\nby such configurations as (d3\/2 s1\/2)4(f7\/2)7 p3\/2, as well as\nsimilar configurations allowing excitations into higher orbitals\nin the pf shells.\nTo see clearly how backbending occurs, the so-called\nbackbending plot is a convenient tool.

Role of the g9\/2 orbital in backbending\nTo study the rotational alignment, it is useful to calculate\nthe single-particle angular momentum component along the\ncranking axis. The quantity is given as\n\u3008jx(m)\u3009 =\n\u2211\nn\n\u03c1mn(jx)nm, (25)\nwhere the indices m, n denote the spherical Nilsson basis.\nFigure 7 shows the single-particle spin component along\nthe cranking axis, in the case where the g9\/2 orbital is\nexcluded from the model space.

[12] also shows that the SD structure ends at J = 24h\u00af.\ncontributor to the total angular momentum, and its contribution\ngradually increases at higher spin states. About 60% of the total\nangular momentum is produced by this orbital (of protons and\nneutrons). The second main component is produced by the d5\/2\norbitals, and its percentage to the total angular momentum\nreaches nearly 20% at J = 25h\u00af. The contributions from the\nd3\/2 and f5\/2 orbitals are also significant at high spin.\nFigure 8 shows the single-particle spin components when\nthe g9\/2 orbital is included in the model space. Beyond\nJ = 20h\u00af, a clear structural change is seen. That is, the\ncontributions from the f7\/2 orbital as well as d3\/2 and f5\/2\norbitals are saturated. Instead, a rapid alignment of the g9\/2\norbital occurs. Obviously, the backbending seen in Fig. 6\nis caused by this structural change. As mentioned earlier,\nin the case of the shell-model calculation, backbending is\ninitiated by the band termination (d3\/2s1\/2)4(f7\/2)8. The higher\nspin states are produced as excitations occur from the f7\/2\norbital to higher orbitals in the pf shell. Comparing that\nwith our results, the backbending occurs for similar but not\nexactly the same reasons. First of all, the direct factor that\ncauses the backbending is the rapid alignment in the g9\/2\norbital, which corresponds to an excitation to higher orbitals,\nbut this excitation is more drastic in the sense that three\nmajor shells are involved (i.e., sd-pf -g).

In fact, the maximum\nangular momentum generated by two particles occupying the\nf7\/2 orbital is 6h\u00af, which is almost the value read in Fig. 8\nfor the f7\/2 orbital. Unlike the simple band termination picture,\nthe d3\/2 and f5\/2 orbitals also show the saturation, despite that\nthe generated angular momenta are less than the maximum\nvalues. No more additional angular momentum is created by\nfurther alignments of these orbitals in the sd and pf shells\nbeyond J = 20h\u00af (i.e., before the backbending). In other words,\nbeyond this total angular momentum, only one high-j orbital\n(g9\/2) dominantly produces an additional angular momentum\non top of the collective angular momentum already produced\nby the particles in the sd and pf shells. This mechanism is\nexactly the same as the original backbending mechanism in the\nrare-earth nuclei, where the i13\/2 orbital (usually of neutrons)\nplays the same role as its counterpart, that is, the g9\/2 orbital.\nThe calculated occupation numbers (Tables III and IV)\nimply that the configuration changes from (d5\/2)\u22122(d3\/2 s1\/2)5\n(fp)8(g9\/2)1 to (d5\/2)\u22123(d3\/2 s1\/2)5(fp)8(g9\/2)2 in the back-\nbending region. Essentially, this change is brought by an\nexcitation from the d5\/2 orbital to the g9\/2 orbital, while the\nconfigurations inside the pf shell and the subspace of the\nsd shell are relatively stable throughout the whole range of\nangular momentum. This excitation from the d5\/2 orbital to\nthe g9\/2 orbital can be understood through the Nilsson diagram\naround \u03b2 \u0001 0.6. There, a low-\u0003 component originating from\nthe g9\/2 orbital, that is, [440]1\/2, behaves like an intruder orbital\ncoming down to the region near the d5\/2 and d3\/2 orbitals.\nThis situation implies that these three positive-parity states\ncan jointly compose the nuclear many-body state when the\nsystem undergoes superdeformation. To produce high angular\nmomentum, it is efficient to place more particles into the g9\/2\norbital.\nTABLE IV.

In other\nwords, this structural change is adiabatic against the increment\nof the Coriolis force. This adiabatic nature of the high-spin\nnuclear structure means nothing but the regularity of the band.\nIn this way, no backbending is seen in this case. Figure 7 shows\nthat the total angular momentum is created mainly through\na gradual and monotonic alignment in the f7\/2 orbital. In\naddition, the contributions of the d3\/2 and the f5\/2 orbitals\nare seen to be non-negligible, as shown in the shell-model\ncalculation.

Captions HFB-GP and\nHFB-NP denote the cases with and without the g9\/2 orbital, respectively.\nmore shrinkage of the deformation can be seen along the\nlongest principal axis of the quadrupole moment. But the two\ncurves start to deviate from each other beyond the angular\nmomentum J = 20h\u00af. The curve corresponding to the case\nwithout the g9\/2 orbital (HFB-Np) shows a monotonic decrease\nto reach \u03b2 \u0001 0.42, while the curve for the case with the g9\/2\norbital (HFB-Gp) stops decreasing at J = 20h\u00af to maintain the\ndeformation larger than \u03b2 = 0.55. The shell-model calculation\nby Poves [10] also implies the shrink of the shape until\nJ = 18h\u00af in the calculation of the intrinsic quadrupole moment,\nQ0. The cranked Skyrme HF calculation by Inakura et al. [12]\nalso shows the shrink, and the elongation is demonstrated\nto keep \u03b2 >\u223c 0.5 (for J \u0001 24h\u00af) for the three parameter sets(SIII, SkM\u2217, and SLy4). This result is consistent with our\nHFB-Gp case, that is, the case with the g9\/2 orbital (and with\nthe nonvanishing initial pairing-gap parameters).\nContrary to the elongation, triaxiality is significantly\ndifferent between the two cases (i.e., with and without the\ng9\/2 orbital). The case without the g9\/2 orbital shows that\nthe triaxiality is always positive (\u03b3 > 0\u25e6) and the triaxial\ndeformation already starts to grow at low spin, although the\ntriaxiality is not large (0\u25e6 <\u223c \u03b3 <\u223c 10\u25e6). The other case (with the\ng9\/2 orbital) shows that the nucleus is axially symmetric until\nthe backbending starts at J = 20h\u00af. Beyond the backbending\nangular momentum (J = 20h\u00af), the triaxiality quickly starts\nto grow with negative values, which are consistent with the\npicture of the band termination. The amount of triaxiality is,\nhowever, not substantial (|\u03b3 | <\u223c 10\u25e6) even at J \u0001 25h\u00af. The\ncranked Skyrme HF calculation [12] gave results consistent\nwith our calculation for the case with the g9\/2 orbital; that is,\n\u03b3 is negative and the amount (an absolute value of \u03b3 ) is less\nthan 10\u25e6 for J \u0001 24h\u00af.\n6. Summary for 40Ca\nLet us summarize here our analysis on the SD states of 40Ca.\nThe structure of the SD band of 40Ca is mainly determined by\nthe eight particles placed in the pf shell. About five to six\nparticles sit in the (s1\/2 d3\/2) subspace of the sd shell, which\ncorresponds to the configuration of six to seven holes. The\ntruncation of the d5\/2 orbital in the shell-model calculation\ndemands the eight-hole configuration in the subspace, which\nis approximately consistent with our result. However, for more\naccurate descriptions, the d5\/2 and g9\/2 orbitals need to be taken\ninto account in the model space. This is particularly so for the\ndescription of the nuclear structure at high spin (J >\u223c 20h\u00af),\nwhere backbending is predicted.\nIn the presence of these additional orbitals, the phenomenon\nsimilar to band termination starts to occur at J = 20h\u00af in our\nmodel, but the saturation of alignments in the pf and sd shells\nare assisted by the quick alignment in the g9\/2 orbital, to which\nparticles are excited from the d5\/2 orbital. This mechanism is\nconsistent with the deformed Nilsson model, where the g9\/2\norbital comes down to the sd shell as an \u201cintruder\u201d orbital at\nsuperdeformation (\u03b2 \u0001 0.6). As a result of the saturation of\nthe spin alignment in the sd-pf shell and the quick alignment\nof the g9\/2 orbital, triaxial deformation starts to occur, but its\namount is not substantial (|\u03b3 | <\u223c 10\u25e6), so one can conclude that\nthe nucleus keeps near-axial symmetry with superdeformation\n(\u03b2 \u0001 0.6).\nB. A case of backbending: 36Ar\nThe second targeted nucleus in this paper, 36Ar, shows\nbackbending at J = 10h\u00af in its superdeformed band, which\nis currently identified up to J = 16h\u00af [1]. The (s1\/2 d3\/2)4(pf )4\nstructure is proposed in the shell-model calculation truncating\nthe d5\/2 orbital [1]. For the cause of the backbending,\nsimultaneous alignments of protons and neutrons in the f7\/2\norbitals were suggested by the PSM [11].\n1. Deformation of the bandhead\nThere are slight disagreements in the calculated bandhead\ndeformation among different models. In the calculation with\nthe cranked Nilsson model, minimization of the potential\nenergy surface E(\u03b3, \u03b2) gave \u03b2 \u0001 0.45 and \u03b3 = 0\u25e6 for the\nbandhead [1]. The PSM calculation assumed axial symmetry\n(\u03b3 = 0\u25e6) and the fixed value \u03b2 \u0001 0.48, no matter how high (or\nlow) the total angular momentum is [11]. The calculations with\nthe cranked Skyrme HF (the SIII and SkM\u2217 parametrizations\n044308-9\nMAKITO OI PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 044308 (2007)\n 0\n 0.2\n 0.4\n 0.6\n 0.8\n 1\n 1.2\n 1.4\n 1.6\n 1.8\n 0  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16\nG\nap\n E\nne\nrg\ny \n(M\neV\n)\nTotal Angular Momentum\n36Ar18\nProton\nNeutron\nFIG. 10.

In the\ncalculation done by Bender et al. assuming axial symmetry [3],\nthere was no SD minimum found in their mean-field solution\n(the Skyrme HF+BCS with the SLy6 force parametrization),\nbut the projected solutions gave rise to a minimum at \u03b2 \u0001 0.5.\nConsidering these calculations, the initial deformation\nparameter \u03b20 = 0.5, as well as axial symmetry (\u03b3 0 = 0\u25e6),\nseems reasonable for our initial deformation parameters. The\ninitial pairing-gap energies are employed to be (\t0p,\t0n) =\n(1.70, 1.65) MeV, which are about 6% stronger than the values\nsuggested in Ref. [18]. This adjustment is made to avoid\nthe sudden disappearance of the gap energy. With this slight\nmodification, the gap energy disappears more gradually and\nsmoothly at J \u0001 7h\u00af, as shown in Fig. 10. We have confirmed,\nhowever, that the overall qualitative nature of the SD state are\nunchanged by the modification.\n3The SLy4 parameter results in triaxial deformation for the SD\nbandhead, but this result may be \u201cless reliable\u201d than the other\nparameter sets, according to the authors [12].\n 0\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n 10\n 12\n 14\n 16\n 0  0.5  1  1.5  2  2.5\nTo\nta\nl A\nng\nul\nar\n M\nom\nen\ntu\nm\nRotational Frequency (MeV)\n36Ar18\nHFB-Gp\nHFB-Np\nEXP\nFIG. 11.

Backbending and roles of the g9\/2 orbital\nTo examine the quality of our calculation, it is useful to\nsee the backbending plot first, which is presented in Fig. 11.\nBecause of the disappearance of the pairing gap at J \u0001 7h\u00af,\nbackbending starts earlier (at J \u0001 7h\u00af) than in the the ex-\nperiment (at J \u0001 10h\u00af). Having accepted this discrepancy, the\ncalculation manages to reproduce the qualitative behavior of\nthe backbending profile of the SD band in this nucleus. Hence,\nto discuss the structural change causing the backbending, it is\nsufficient to study the configurations before and after J \u0001 7h\u00af\nin our model. Let us see the corresponding occupation numbers\nnext.\nThe occupation numbers are displayed in Fig. 12, as well\nas in Tables VII and VIII. Table VII, which presents the con-\nfigurations before the backbending, shows that approximately\nfour and a half particles occupy the subspace of the sdshell, as\nwell as the pf shell. The g9\/2 orbital is occupied by less than\none particle, so the orbital is expected to play only a limited\nrole in the low-spin structure of 36Ar. One can notice that there\nare about two holes in the d5\/2 orbital. This result implies the\nstructure of (d5\/2)\u22122(s1\/2 d3\/2)4.5(fp)4.5(g9\/2)1 at the bandhead\nof the SD band, which is similar to the (s1\/2 d3\/2)4(fp)4\nstructure suggested by the shell-model calculation. This\nstructure, which has a configuration of two holes in the d5\/2\norbital and one particle in the g9\/2 orbital, is also similar to our\nresult for the bandhead structure of the SD band of 40Ca with\nthe g9\/2 orbital included in the model space.\nTurning our focus onto the higher spin states inside the SD\nband, one can tell that the configuration actually turns out to\nbe closer to the configuration suggested by the shell-model\ncalculation. From Table VIII, our calculation suggests the\n(d5\/2)\u22121(s1\/2 d3\/2)5(fp)4 at J = 16h\u00af. Again, the g9\/2 orbital\nseems to play no role in this case, so the state resembles\nthe 4p-4h configuration (s1\/2 d3\/2)4(fp)4 in the truncated\nTABLE VIII.

In this case, the g9\/2\norbital is included in the model space.\nshell-model diagonalization. From this analysis, we can say\nthat the basic configuration does not change much after the\nbackbending.\nFigure 12 also suggests that the g9\/2 orbital is not a key\nplayer in the backbending. Its occupation number is quite\nlow and fairly regular throughout the whole range of the total\nangular momentum. Instead, the occupation number in the f7\/2\norbital suddenly starts to increase in the post-backbending\nregion (J >\u223c 7h\u00af) to indicate a rotational alignment in this\norbital. This result is consistent with the interpretation of\nbackbending by the PSM [11]. The s1\/2 orbital also shows\nan increase, but it is more gradual than that of the f7\/2 orbital.\nThe sharp drop of the hole occupation number in the d5\/2\norbital can be noticed clearly in the figure. This means that\nthe d5\/2 orbital starts to be filled by the deexcitations from\nthe upper shells (about a half particle from the g9\/2 orbital\nand another half from the pf shells). This result implies that\nthe deformation becomes less substantial, and the cross-shell\nexcitation is suppressed to some extent. We will take a closer\nlook at the relation between the deformation \u03b2 and the position\nof the g9\/2 orbital intruding into the sd shell soon below.\nAn indication of the decrease in elongation at high spin\nwas reported by other calculations such as the shell-model\ndiagonalization [10], the cranked Skyrme HF calculation [12],\nand the cranked Nilsson calculation [22].\nFigure 13 shows the calculated quadrupole deformation\nin terms of triaxiality \u03b3 and elongation \u03b2, with our model.\nWith or without the g9\/2 orbital in the model space, there is\nno much difference in the manner of the shape evolution,\nas already mentioned above. Before the backbending, the\nsystem maintains an axially symmetric shape, while triaxial\ndeformation starts to grow after the backbending (in particular,\nJ >\u223c 10h\u00af), although the absolute value of \u03b3 is less than 10\u25e6.\nThe small |\u03b3 | value explains the reason for the successful\ndescriptions of the PSM calculation [11], as well as the\nprojected GCM calculation [13].\nBased on the above discussions, it seems that we can\nconclude that the g9\/2 orbital plays no significant role, unlike\nin the 40Ca case. This can be qualitatively explained by two\nfactors. One is the position of the Fermi levels, which are\nlower than the one of the 40Ca. That is, cross-shell excitations\ncost energetically more in 36Ar than in 40Ca. The other is\nthe smaller \u03b2 value of the quadrupole deformation. From the\nNilsson diagram, it can be learned that the g9\/2 orbital can\nbehave like an intruder orbital when the deformation is as\nlarge as \u03b2 \u0001 0.6.

The second backbending seems to happen\nat J \u0001 14h\u00af in the case without the g9\/2 orbital (HFB-Np).\nObviously, this result is inconsistent with the experimental\ndata, which show no sign of the second backbending. The\ncase with the g9\/2 orbital (HFB-Gp) shows results closer to the\nexperiment. Apparently, analyses of the occupation numbers\nand the deformation evolution indicate that the g9\/2 orbital\nplays no active role in the SD structure. But these results do\nnot necessarily mean that one can exclude the g9\/2 orbital from\nthe model space.\nLet us examine how this discrepancy happens. First of all,\nlet us compare the occupation numbers in these two cases (i.e.,\nHFB-Gp and HFB-Np) at J = 16h\u00af. The case with the g9\/2\norbital (HFB-Gp) was already shown in Table VIII, whereas\nthe case without the g9\/2 orbital (HFB-Np) is presented in\nTable IX. No significant difference can be seen in the data\nfrom these two tables. Only a tiny difference can be seen in\nthat the concentration onto the f7\/2 orbital is slightly higher in\nthe latter case than in the former.\nIt is then worth looking at the single-particle spin compo-\nnent along the cranking axis. There are differences between\nthe two cases, which are found in the f7\/2 and d5\/2 orbitals\nat J >\u223c 14h\u00af. Their behaviors are plotted in Fig. 14.

The low occupation number in this orbital implies\nthe consistency with the case without the g9\/2 orbital. On\nthe other hand, f7\/2 and d5\/2 orbitals show slightly different\nbehaviors in the two cases (HFB-Gp and -Np in the figure,\nwhich correspond to the case with and without the g9\/2 orbital\nin the model space). When the g9\/2 orbital is removed from\nthe model space, the alignment in the f7\/2 orbital is slightly\naccelerated beyond J = 14h\u00af. Whereas, in the other case, the\nalignment of the f7\/2 orbital slows down a little. The opposite\nbehavior is seen in the d5\/2 orbitals. From this analysis, it can\nbe said that the further alignment in the f7\/2 orbital causes\nthe second backbending when the g9\/2 orbital is absent. This\nbackbending should be regarded as an artifact, and it is caused\nby the secondary effect due to the lack of the g9\/2 orbital,\nwhich creates subtle differences from the case with the g9\/2\norbital.\nTherefore, despite the discrepancy in Fig. 11, our previous\nconclusion that the g9\/2 orbital plays no major role in the SD\nband of 36Ar still holds, because the qualitative character of\nthe SD structure does not change whether the g9\/2 orbital is\n-1\n 0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 0  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16\nE-\n0.\n08\n23\n4 \nI(I+\n1) \n[M\neV\n]\nTotal Angualr Momentum (I)\n36Ar18\nHFB\nEXP\nFIG. 16.

It is true, however, that a better description\ndemands an inclusion of the g9\/2 orbital in the model space,\nparticularly for the backbending plot.\n3. Pairing correlation and band termination\nLet us now compare the energy spectra between the\ncalculation and the experimental data, which are shown in\nFigs. 15 and 16. Discrepancies are seen in the backbending\nregion (8 <\u223c J <\u223c 12h\u00af). As we discussed earlier, these discrep-\nancies are the result of the pairing collapse (see also Fig. 10).\nBut the qualitative behavior is managed to be reproduced. In\nparticular, the plateau structure at low spin and a sharp slope at\nhigh spin are well reproduced in Fig. 16. In comparison with\nthe cranked Nilsson calculation in Ref. [1], our result shows\nan improvement as a mean-field approach, which takes into\naccount the pairing.\nWithout the pairing, the cranked Nilsson calculation sug-\ngests an occurrence of the band-termination phenomenon\nfor the SD band of 36Ar [22]. The typical feature of the\nband termination appears as a shape change into oblate\ndeformation. Earlier in the present study, we learned that\ntriaxial deformation is suppressed with a proper treatment of\nthe pairing (Fig. 13). It is interesting to study if the band\ntermination and the associated oblate deformation can emerge\nin the absence of pairing in our model.\nBy choosing the initial pairing-gap parameters to be very\nweak, that is, (\t0p,\t0n) = (0.15, 0.15) MeV, the effect of the\npairing correlation is examined in the following calculation.\n(The g9\/2 orbital is included in this analysis.) This choice\nof the initial parameters causes the breakdown of pairing\nas early as at J \u0001 1.5h\u00af. Effectively, the calculation turns\ninto the HF calculation beyond this total angular momentum,\nwhich can be comparable with the cranked Nilsson calculation\nwithout the pairing. The corresponding cranking calculation\ngives regular solutions until J = 16h\u00af, the band termination\npoint. But beyond the termination point, the solution becomes\nirregular and shows unphysical behavior, so we ignore the\ncalculations beyond the band termination point in this analysis.\nIn the band termination spin (J = 16h\u00af), the occupation\nnumbers of the f7\/2 orbital are calculated to be 1.94 each for\nneutrons and protons. Therefore, the net particles occupying\nthe f7\/2 orbital are four (i.e., = 2 + 2), and the result is\nconsistent with the shell-model configuration. Two particles\noccupying the f7\/2 orbital can generate the maximum angular\nmomentum of J = 6h\u00af, which corresponds to the band termi-\nnation.\nIn Fig. 17, the calculated single-particle alignments are\nplotted for protons and neutrons. Our calculation (without\nthe paring) reproduces the above situation: the single-particle\nangular momentum carried by the f7\/2 orbital is almost 12 h\u00af,\nconsisting of 6h\u00af for protons and 6h\u00af for neutrons.\nIn Fig. 18, the calculated quadrupole deformations, that\nis, triaxiality \u03b3 and elongation \u03b2, are plotted. The profile for\nthe elongation does not change from the previous case with\nthe pairing correlation. However, the behavior of the triaxial\nevolution is different, especially beyond J = 12h\u00af. At the band\ntermination point, the value of \u03b3 reaches \u221260\u25e6, indicating\nthe noncollective oblate shape. From this analysis relying\non the self-consistent cranking calculation, it is confirmed that\nthe band termination phenomenon happens when the pairing\ncorrelation is absent from the system (or is very weak).\n4. Summary for 36Ar\nAs a partial summary for 36Ar, we can conclude that the\npreviously proposed structure, (s1\/2 d3\/2)4(fp)4, seems to be a\ngood approximation for the structure of 36Ar, according to our\nresults. It is suggested that backbending in the SD band of 36Ar\nis caused by the alignment in the f7\/2 orbitals, as concluded by\nthe PSM calculation [11]. The g9\/2 orbital does not play any\nsignificant role. From the successful description of the SD band\nat low spin and the failure in the backbending region, it was\ndemonstrated that the pairing correlation is very important to\ndescribing the structure of the SD band. Triaxial deformation\nstarts to occur at high spin, but the degree of triaxiality is not\nsubstantial; therefore, the SD states are well described as an\naxially symmetric nuclear many-body system.\n044308-13\nMAKITO OI PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 044308 (2007)\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n 0\n 10\n 0  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16\nTr\nia\nxi\nal\nity\n (d\neg\n)\nTotal Angular Momentum\n36Ar18\n 0.3\n 0.35\n 0.4\n 0.45\n 0.5\n 0  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16\nEl\non\nga\ntio\nn\nTotal Angular Momentum\n36Ar18\nFIG. 18.

CONCLUSIONS\nThe self-consistent cranking calculation based on the HFB\nmethod was applied to the superdeformed bands of two N = Z\nnuclei, 40Ca and 36Ar. Our microscopic calculations with the\nP+Q\u00b7Q interaction can give good qualitative explanations (oc-\ncasionally quantitatively) for the energy spectrum, rotational\nalignment, and backbending phenomenon of these nuclear\nsystems.\nSpecial attention was paid to the roles of (1) the d5\/2 orbital,\nwhich was removed from the sd-pf model space in the shell-\nmodel diagonalizations, and (2) the g9\/2 orbital, which belongs\nto a higher shell (N = 4) than the sd-pf shell. The effect of\nthe pairing correlation was also investigated in connection with\nthe evolution of triaxial deformation and the band termination\nphenomenon.\nInside the framework of our model, it was found that the\ntruncation of the d5\/2 orbital can be justified as far as lower\nspin states are considered. Whereas high-spin states are found\nto be produced as a result of a gradual excitation from the d5\/2\norbital to the upper sd shell. However, for both 40Ca and 36Ar,\nthe inclusion of the d5\/2 orbital does not affect the nuclear\nstructure of the SD states very much.\nOn the contrary, the g9\/2 orbital was found to change\nthe nuclear structure drastically for 40Ca: backbending may\nhappen at J \u0001 20h\u00af. However, the orbital plays no significant\nrole for 36Ar. These differences come from the location of the\nFermi levels and the deformation \u03b2, which is \u00010.6 for 40Ca\nwhile \u00010.4 for 36Ar. This difference influences the position\nof the g9\/2 orbital as an \u201cintruder orbital\u201d into the sd shell, in\nterms of the deformed Nilsson model.\nThe pairing correlation was found to be important to\nproducing a proper energy spectrum and tends to act as\na suppressor of triaxial deformation. Without the pairing,\ntriaxial deformation would be enhanced and the noncollective\noblate shape (\u03b3 = \u221260\u25e6) would ultimately emerge at high\nspin. However, in our model taking the pairing correlation\ninto account, it is observed that triaxiality is suppressed to\n|\u03b3 | <\u223c 10\u25e6. In this sense, the SD states of both 40Ca and 36Ar\nare nearly axial symmetric in our model, which can justify\nother calculations assuming the axial symmetry.\nDespite the success for the qualitative explanations, a\nproblem was recognized in relation to the pairing col-\nlapse at high spin. An improvement is surely neces-\nsary for more accurate and quantitative descriptions of\nthe high-spin structure, especially around the backbending\nregion.\nNevertheless, through this work, the P+Q\u00b7Q model based\non the cranked HFB approach was demonstrated to be a\npractical and effective model for describing a high-spin nuclear\nstructure showing superdeformation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author appreciates the useful discussions he had\nwith S.
