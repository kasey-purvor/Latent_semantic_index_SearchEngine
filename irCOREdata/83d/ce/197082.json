In this paper,\nwe seek a critical reappraisal of the role of\ninnovation in quality improvement in\nhealthcare. Using a range of disciplinary\nperspectives (rather than offering an exten-\nsive literature review), we identify the trade-\noff problems associated with innovation, and\nwe challenge practitioners, organisations and\ninstitutions to recognise and confront the\nparadoxes of innovation.\nFIRST PARADOX OF INNOVATION: UPTAKE OF\nTHE DUBIOUS, REJECTION OF THE GOOD\nThe first paradox of innovation is the well-\nknown problem that some new practices\nenjoy rapid uptake and diffusion throughout\nhealth systems, even when they are of limited\nbenefit or unproven efficacy, or represent\nrisks to patients, while other innovations that\ncould secure better outcomes for patients\nnever make it to the bedside.\nThe reasons why unproven innovations are\nsometimes rapidly adopted and implemented\nare becoming better understood.1 Some are\nrather like consumer fadsda new technology\nor therapy generates the excitement of\nnewness and \u2018must-have\u2019deven before the\nevidence base has been firmly established.\nFor example, percutaneous bladder neck\nsuspension for stress incontinence was\ninitially hailed as a great success and came\ninto widespread use, but subsequent long-\nterm follow-up of trials showed very disap-\npointing outcomes.2 Some innovations\ndiffuse rapidly because they offer hope in\notherwise intractable or desperate situations\nwhere denying an available therapy is diffi-\ncult. Examples include the use of laetrile\nfor cancer, which, despite its enthusiastic\npromotion during the 1970s, lacked evidence\nof effectivenessdand indeed there is some\nevidence of toxicity.3 Some innovations are\nadopted and implemented because they\nhave considerable face validity or intuitive\nappeal as plausible solutions, but later turn\nout to be wrong. Well-known examples\ninclude the use of antiarrhythmic agents in\nthe treatment of myocardial infarction, and\nhuman albumin in treatment of critically ill\npatients.4 Organisations may also adopt\ninnovations as a defence against anxiety, to\nguard against criticism that any failing was\n1Department of Health\nSciences, Adrian Building,\nUniversity of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK\n2Haute Autorite de Sante\n(HAS), Saint Denis-La Plaine,\nFrance\n3Division of Biostatistics,\nJohns Hopkins School of\nMedicine, Baltimore,\nMaryland, USA\n4Centre for Healthcare\nImprovement, Chalmers\nUniversity of Technology,\nGothenburg, Sweden\n5Director of the Centre for\nResearch in Evidence-based\nPractice, Faculty of Health\nSciences and Medicine, Bond\nUniversity, Headington, UK\nCorrespondence to\nProfessor Mary\nDixon-Woods, Department of\nHealth Sciences, Adrian\nBuilding, University of\nLeicester, Leicester LE1 7RH,\nUK; md11@le.ac.uk\nAccepted 9 October 2010\nThis paper is freely available\nonline under the BMJ\nJournals unlocked scheme,\nsee http:\/\/qualitysafety.bmj.\ncom\/site\/about\/unlocked.\nxhtml\nBMJ Qual Saf 2011;20(Suppl 1):i47ei51. doi:10.1136\/bmjqs.2010.046227 i47\nThe social determinants of action\n group.bmj.com on May 16, 2011 - Published by qualitysafety.bmj.comDownloaded from \ndue to non-adoption. The widespread use of early\nwarning scores and rapid response teams for deterio-\nrating patients, despite only very equivocal evidence of\nbenefit,5 may be an example of this.\nThe uptake of many dubious interventions relies on\na form of magical thinking, where doing something is\nseen as better than doing nothing. The language used\nto promote innovations can be strongly implicated in\nsuch thinking. Terms such as \u2018breakthrough,\u2019 \u2018radical,\u2019\n\u2018new\u2019 and even \u2018innovative\u2019 can stimulate consumer\ninstincts, including those related to anticipated decision\nregretdwhere patients (and doctors) are reluctant to\nturn down any chance of possible improvement, even if\nthere is only a small chance of success.6\nOf course, rapid diffusion of innovation is also driven\nby profit-seeking behaviour. The engines of innovation\nmay be commercial organisations prepared to resort to\ninventing \u2018diseases\u2019 (such as social anxiety disorder),\nrepackaging cheap treatments as expensive ones for\nnew markets (eg, using an expensive form of the cheap\ncolon cancer drug Avastin for treating macular degen-\neration) or bringing to market technologies that offer\nonly limited advantages over existing treatments.\nMany new devicesdparticularly diagnostic onesdneed\ndo no more than demonstrate that they comply with\nbasic safety standards, and produce no evidence of\nefficacy. But organisations that stand to profit from the\nuse of a new intervention may use sophisticated and\naggressive marketing strategies, often enlisting patient\npressure along the way and pressing political buttons to\ngarner support. Clamour for therapies from desperate\npatients can be difficult to resist, as every health system\nin the world has discovered. Once institutions have\ninvested in a new intervention, they then have a vested\ninterest in recovering the costs, as the example of proton\nbeam therapy for prostate cancer shows.\nDiffusion of innovation without proven efficacy intro-\nduces several threats to quality improvement. Most\nobviously, such innovation may pose risks to patients.\nMore insidiously, the deflection of effort and investment\nis a huge opportunity cost for health systems that\nundermines efforts to improve services. Further, the\ninnovation may disrupt or displace procedures in areas\nthat have been targets of quality improvement.\nA mirror image to the problem of innovations without\nproven efficacy is the failure of diffusion of innovations\nthat are of proven value. Here again, the evidence about\nwhat causes some efficacious innovations to remain\nunwrapped in the box is emerging. Some innovationsd\nfor example, pelvic floor exercises or improved hand\nhygiene practicesdhave little of the glamour of new\ntechnologies and generate little excitement. Others\nrequire a level of investment, training or reinforcement\nthat healthcare organisations or practitioners may\nstruggle to achieve. Some are simply tedious and\ninconvenient, or threaten existing interests. Many lack\na well-funded advocate with access to modern marketing\ntechniques and budgets; when there is no manufacturer\nwho stands to profit, promotion may be lacklustre. Some\nfall victim to the problem that when there are plenty of\nareas where coercive forces are at work (eg, targets or\nstandards against which performance will be rewarded),\nthe spotlight naturally slips off those that are not the\nfocus of such measures.\nThe appeal of the new and the rejection of the dull\ncannot be explained by focusing solely on individual and\norganisational behaviours. Complex systemic processes\nand institutional forces are at work. For example, deci-\nsions about which clinical research is done and which is\npublished (and where) are implicated in determining\nwhether an intervention ever comes to attention, what\nkinds of attention it gets and whether it gets adopted or\nimplemented. Publication bias, which causes interven-\ntions to appear more useful than they really are, is just\none of these systemic effects.\nSECOND PARADOX OF INNOVATION: THE WISDOM AND\nFAILINGS OF DEMOCRACY\nThe second paradox of innovation is that one of the\nmost effective ways of ensuring the implementation of\nnew technologies, therapies and techniques is by\nworking cooperatively with the professional groups\nexpected to engage in implementing it, but relying solely\non cooperation may also be the most effective way of\nkilling an innovation.\nTheoretical work on participatory governance has\ndrawn on Charles Lindblom\u2019s arguments about the\n\u2018intelligence of democracy\u2019 to emphasise the benefits of\ninvolving those likely to be affected by change and with\nrelevant knowledge in decisions about innovation and\nimplementation.7 Participatory, collaborative forms of\ndecision-making and action may not only enable better\ninformed decisions but also foster social learning and\nmore sustainable outcomes, unite and motivate those\nwith a commitment to solving problems, increase the\nchances of detecting the potential for innovation, and\nimprove people\u2019s willingness to accept change.8 There\nis now increasing recognition of, and excitement\nabout, the role of self-organising, self-governing\nnetworks in securing desirable outcomes in healthcare\nand elsewhere.9e12 Within healthcare, there has been\nparticular interest in using a social movements approach\nas an alternative to programmatic approaches that\nemphasise centrally led, planned programmes of\nchange. Social movements are characterised by their\nself-directing nature, their use of informal systems and\nthe self-management of change.13\ni48 BMJ Qual Saf 2011;20(Suppl 1):i47ei51. doi:10.1136\/bmjqs.2010.046227\nThe social determinants of action\n group.bmj.com on May 16, 2011 - Published by qualitysafety.bmj.comDownloaded from \nSuch approaches may be especially promising in their\nability to address well-known problems of attempts\nto change practice among professionals, who may\nstrongly prefer to take their \u2018directions for performance\u2019\nfrom within rather than outside their professional\ngroup14 and be capable of subverting administrative\nfiats and managerial instructions.15 16 Social movements\nand other forms of community-based participatory\napproaches, with their emphasis on cooperation and\nnorms of reciprocity, may be more likely to enable\ncollaborative activity to be maintained long term,17 and\nthus promote sustainability of innovation. The strengths\nof such approaches to professional work are reinforced\nby their continuities with longstanding collegial struc-\ntures, and the corresponding centrality of the commu-\nnity principle in the organisation and experience of\nprofessional work.18\nHowever, the counter to the \u2018wisdom of democracy\u2019 is\nthe failings of democracy. Group-based, cooperative\nefforts may be undermined by those who fail to\nengage with, or commit to, the collaborative activity,\nand by the risk that individuals will substitute their\nown goals for those of the group, so that the collabo-\nration is undermined by individual or group interests.18\nProfessional boundaries, particularly between different\ndisciplines and occupational groups, may create\nbarriers to proper collaboration. Social movements can\nbecome sites of struggle and contestation, and may\nnever succeed in fully delivering their aims. For\ninstance, the evidence-based medicine (EBM) move-\nment, including the founding of the Cochrane Collab-\noration, can be understood as a social movement19 that\nsought to respond to the problem we identified in\nParadox 1: that some treatments known to work are\nignored, and other treatments not shown to work\nget used. Though this particular social movement\nhas enjoyed enormous success, Paradox 1 has not\ndisappeared, and the command of EBM over the\nhearts and minds of many clinicians has been, at best,\npartial.\nSome of the reasons for variable success of participa-\ntory, grass-roots approaches lie in the difficulties of\ncreating arenas and opportunities for clinicians to\ncollaborate and the antagonism of bureaucratic and\nprofessional structures to so doing. These are important\nproblems, since those leading and managing networks\nmust elicit support through building coalitions and\nforging agreement, sometimes in the face of local\nopposition or inertia,20 as well as creating environments\nwhere productive, goal-directed relationships and inter-\nactions are most likely to occur. They must also be able to\nmanage the changing nature of the collaborative effort\nover time, and address the risk that collaborations may\nstart out with considerable enthusiasm, but gradually\ndevelop less helpful features including competition\nand rivalry between different members of the network,\nfragmentation or duplication of effort, emergence of\ndisruptive hierarchies, or diminishing commitment and\nability to secure resources.17 Professional groups are\nthemselves susceptible to persuasion and manipulation\nby commercial forcesdeither directly or indirectlydthat\nmay undermine their ability to behave in the interests of\nthe public good. If innovation is to be managed appro-\npriately in healthcare, there is an urgent need to find\napproaches that can combine the benefits of coopera-\ntive, participatory approaches with other regulatory\ntechniques.\nTHIRD PARADOX OF INNOVATION: HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE\nNEVER ABLE TO KEEP UP\nThe third paradox of innovation is that improvement\nrequires change, but change always generates new chal-\nlenges. Quality improvement systems are rarely able to\nkeep pace with innovation; innovation disrupts. For\nexample, the rise of stenting procedures by cardiologists\nmeans that many patients previously managed by\ncardiothoracic surgeons (bypass surgery) are now\nbeing cared for by different personnel in different\nphysical configurations of healthcare settings, and\nthus a whole new set of quality challenges arises.\nFurther, people improvise, change their habits and\nreconfigure their work practices in response to new\ntechnologies, often in unpredictable ways.21 By the time\nquality-assurance systems have caught up with the \u2018new\u2019\nmodality, things have already moved on yet again.\nHaving a cycle of renewal and reinvention creates\nongoing organisational turbulence and may diminish\norganisational and practitioner enthusiasm for quality\nimprovement.\nThis problem is intensified by the ongoing failure of\nthe dominant evaluation paradigm. This continues to\nconfine evaluation narrowly to the intervention that is\nthe direct focus of the evaluation, rather than consid-\nering the systemic effects and unintended consequences\nof interventions. For instance, a typical evaluation\nseeking to assess whether a new technique for moni-\ntoring patients at risk of critical illness will tend to\ndetermine the effects of the technique only for that class\nof patients. The risks the system introduces elsewhere\n(such as the impact of prioritising monitoring over other\ngoals of healthcare) thus remain unknown. Social\nscience work is needed alongside intervention studies\nnot only to help assess unintended consequences, but\nalso to provide vital evidence about issues relating to\nadoption, implementation and optimisation in different\ncontexts.\nBMJ Qual Saf 2011;20(Suppl 1):i47ei51. doi:10.1136\/bmjqs.2010.046227 i49\nThe social determinants of action\n group.bmj.com on May 16, 2011 - Published by qualitysafety.bmj.comDownloaded from \nCONCLUSION: ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS OF\nINNOVATION\nRationality is a contested concept in the social sciences,\nbut perhaps the most influential approach derives from\nthe work of psychologists Tversky and Kahnemann, who\nspecify rationality in terms of consistency and coher-\nence.22 Defined in that sense, the paradoxes we have\noutlined help to explain why it makes little sense to\nthink of rationality as the main driver of innovation in\nhealth systems. Non-rational collective decisions should\nperhaps be considered the norm rather than the outlier:\nwhen health systems are faced with continual external\nand internal pressures for innovation combined with\nstrong emotional, economic and political forces, the\nability of those systems to engage in rational debate and\nplanning is undermined. Yet the need to avoid unnec-\nessary innovations and manage the transition for neces-\nsary innovations is among the most important challenges\nfacing health systems today.\nIf a new technology or technique is being considered\nfor use, health systems should consider the principles of\nquality improvement as they are introduced rather than\nwaiting for the inevitable problems to occur (box 1).\nThus, for a new surgical procedure, we might ask:\ni. What is the evidence that the procedure improves\noutcomes in other settings, while recognising the\ncomplexities of generalisation?23\nii. What support, training and systems will be needed\nbefore it can be introduced?\niii. How should we monitor the introduction?\nBy asking the first question, we may avoid the many\ndisruptive innovations that are fashions rather than true\nimprovements. By asking the second and third ques-\ntions, we will smooth the transition. By thinking carefully\nand critically about when we should regard health\nsystems reforms as \u2018clinical experiments\u2019 (and thus\nrequiring the same level of evidence and oversight as\nother clinical interventions24) and when we should\nregard reforms as a normal part of the continuous\nexperiential learning required to improve healthcare, we\nremain alert to the possible impactsdboth negative and\npositivedof innovation.\nThese are all difficult challenges and require courage\nin the face of uncertainty, in the face of vested interests,\nin the face of immense political, patient and provider-led\nappetites and pressures, and in the face of financial\nsqueeze and organisational and institutional inertia.\nPerhaps most importantly, these challenges require the\ncourage to fail and learn.25 In summary, quality\nimprovement work needs to reconsider the role of\ninnovation. In the long term, most elements in\nany medical system will be discarded and replaced. If\nwe focus on making wise and courageous choices of\ninnovations, introducing them with quality improvement\nprinciples in mind, then our future healthcare systems\nwill better serve patients.\nCompeting interests None.\nProvenance and peer review Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.\nREFERENCES\n1.
