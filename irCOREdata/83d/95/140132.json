Introduction\nThe value of effective supplier management is well known. Applied appropriately, it can sig-\nnificantly improve a manufacturer\u2019s performance in terms of cost reduction, achieving con-\nstant improvements in quality levels, and enhancing new product design (Monczka et al.,\n1993; Primo and Amundson, 2002). To achieve these advantages, practitioners have recog-\nnized the necessity of working closely with their suppliers, in what are often termed \u201cpartner-\nships\u201d (e.g. Fretty, 2001; Kerns, 2000). Many academic studies have pointed to the advan-\ntages to be gained from cooperation with suppliers (e.g., Carr and Pearson, 1999; Monczka et\nal., 1993). Surprisingly, however, our understanding of the nature of supplier-manufacturer\nrelationships remains limited.\nUntil the 1990s, manufacturers focused primarily on cost, quality and delivery in their\ndealings with suppliers and relationships were often \u201ctransactional\u201d and \u201cadversarial\u201d. Manu-\nfacturers then started to consider a much wider range of factors; including a supplier\u2019s compe-\ntencies, the overall service provided, financial stability and even the supplier\u2019s organizational\nculture (Goffin, 1997; O\u2019Toole and Donaldson, 2002). As it became recognized that suppliers\ncould make longer-term contributions, for example to product innovation, a stream of litera-\nture started to recommend the development of partnerships with suppliers. For example Met-\ncalf et al. (1992, p27) stated that \u201cthe more cautious, arm\u2019s-length relationships of the past are\ngiving way to closer buyer-seller co-operation, driven by the perception that there are greater\nbenefits to be obtained through such partnerships.\u201d In recent years managers have widely\n2adopted the term partnership but they appear to use it in referring to a range of different rela-\ntionships (McCutcheon and Stuart, 2000). In fact, partnership has become a \u201cbuzzword\u201d be-\ncause, as Brennan (1997, p768) notes, \u201cfashionable managerial expressions are prone to over-\nuse, abuse and consequently to devaluation\u2026 the same fate awaits, or may already have be-\nfallen \u2018buyer\/supplier partnership\u2019.\u201d\nAlthough relationships are often discussed in the extant literature, there is a gap: how do\nmanagers perceive the range of different relationships they have with organizations in their\nsupplier base? Our understanding of supplier-manufacturer relationships has been clouded by\nthe implicit assumption that partnerships are always desirable and by the limitations of trying\nto understand the nature of complex relationships using direct questioning alone. The variety\nof conditions that lead to, affect or characterize close relationships is not adequately under-\nstood. In consequence, this paper describes how managers perceive relationships with their\nsuppliers. The goal of the research was a better understanding of relationships, in order that\nthey can be better managed. The current study is part of a wider program of research on sup-\nplier management, which focused on Germany because of the importance and reputation of its\nmanufacturing sector (Rommel, 1991). The overall study took a multiple methods approach\nand the research described in this paper was based on 39 in-depth interviews. These utilized a\ntechnique from psychology for investigating inter-personal relationships\uf0berepertory grid\ntechnique. The application of this technique to supplier management research is new. The re-\nsults are important as they give a clearer understanding of relationships, demonstrate the vi-\nability of the methodology, and have implications for practitioners\uf0beindicating how they can\nmanage their suppliers more effectively.\nThis paper has five further sections. Section 2 reviews the literature on manufacturer-\nsupplier relationships. Section 3 presents the research question and explains the methodology.\n3The results are covered in Section 4, followed by a comprehensive discussion of the findings\nand implications for both researchers and practitioners (Section 5). Finally, Section 6 presents\nthe overall conclusions and ideas for further research.\n2. Supplier-manufacturer relationships\nRelationships between manufacturers and their suppliers are typically called \u201csupplier-\nmanufacturer relationships\u201d. The term \u201cbuyer-supplier relationships\u201d is broader in that it can\nalso be used to refer to relationships between companies in the service sector. As this paper\nfocuses on manufacturing, we will use the former term but shorten it to \u201csupplier relation-\nships\u201d throughout. Supplier relationships range from transactional to close ones. In conduct-\ning research on relationships, it is important to recognize that the way in which the term\n\u201cpartnership\u201d has been commonly used has led to confusion for three main reasons:\na) Relationships between manufacturers and suppliers are a form of business relationship,\nwhich are often described as partnerships. This does not infer that they have the same legal\nbasis as a formal business partnership, or alliance. We propose that a better term would be\n\u201cpartnership-like\u201d relationships, indicating a relationship that is not based on legal defini-\ntions;\nb) Partnership-like relationships are context dependent rather than being an absolute concept.\nSeveral researchers have recognized that partnership-like relationships vary depending on\nhow \u201cclose\u201d they are (e.g. Ellram, 1991; Saxton, 1997). Therefore, the degree of closeness\noffers a way to both explore and explain relationships, including partnership-like relation-\nships;\n4c) Partnership-like relationships are not appropriate for the whole of the supplier base (al-\nthough, as we will see, this is almost universally assumed).\nAs indicated in the introduction, there is a wide literature on the value of close supplier rela-\ntionships but we will exclude this from our review as we are focusing on the nature of rela-\ntionships themselves. Three topics are pertinent to the current study and important to help in\nclarifying the concepts involved:\n\uf0a7 The appropriateness of close relationships;\n\uf0a7 Building and maintaining close relationships;\n\uf0a7 The nature of close relationships.\n2.1 The appropriateness of close relationships\nMuch of the literature has implied that close relationships with suppliers are always desirable,\nwithout proper consideration of the contextual factors influencing their effectiveness. For ex-\nample, da Villa and Panizzolo (1996) indicated that manufacturers\u2019 relationships with their\nsuppliers have, in general, evolved during the 1990s towards partnership. They did not iden-\ntify that some transactional relationships may still be appropriate in the supplier base. Simi-\nlarly, Webster (1992) talked of a \u201cclear evolution\u201d away from arm\u2019s-length transactions to-\nwards partnerships, alliances, and networks. This overlooks that purchasing commodity items\ndoes not require the creation of close relationships. The risks associated with partnerships also\nseem to have been largely ignored in the literature (Spina and Zotteri, 2000).\nA key question is: when are close relationships desirable? Researchers are now starting\nto investigate the contextual factors that make partnerships apposite and viable (e.g.\nMcCutcheon and Stuart, 2000). Typically, a range of different relationships will be appropri-\n5ate within the supplier base at any one time and Petroni and Panciroli (2002) recommended\nthat the supplier base should be managed as a \u201cportfolio\u201d of relationships. Brennan (1997)\nhighlighted the need to identify the product categories for which special relationships are nec-\nessary. An example from the automotive sector found that it is useful to classify and manage\nsuppliers according to their involvement in new product development, the importance of their\ncomponents in overall car performance, and the component lead time (Zirpoli and Caputo,\n2002). Overall it can be seen that close relationships can bring advantages to manufacturers\nbut this approach is not a panacea for the whole of the supplier base (Johnson et al, 2004).\n2.2 Building and maintaining close relationships\nBuilding relationships is one of the most difficult aspects of supply chain management (John-\nson et al, 2004). McCutcheon and Stuart (2000) found that manufacturers should look at what\nthey termed the \u201cdesirability\u201d and the \u201cfeasibility\u201d of partnership. The first factor is related\nlargely to the technical capabilities of the supplier, and the match with a manufacturer\u2019s needs\nover time (including the technology development trajectory). Feasibility is connected with the\ntwo companies\u2019 views on the potential benefits, and the extent of goodwill and trust between\nthem. Identification of the benefits for both parties is the foundation on which close, partner-\nship-like relationships can be built. Zirpoli and Caputo (2002) identified a complex set of fac-\ntors that are essential for the establishment of effective supplier relationships including: long-\nterm contractual agreements to reduce uncertainty and support investments; suitable use of\nfinancial monitoring techniques such as target costing (to put enough focus on efficiency);\nand information sharing.\nOnce suitability has been verified, subtle management is required to grow a supplier\ninto a full service provider. Full service provider means that the supplier provides excellent\n6logistical and technical services (Petroni and Panciroli, 2002). Developing and maintaining\nhigh levels of trust has often been identified in the literature as an essential issue in relation-\nships (e.g. Scott and Westbrook, 1991; Webster, 1992), but the operationalization of this con-\ncept is not simple. \u201cTrust is not simply an input to a relationship; it is both a pre-requisite and\nan outcome of relationship development\u201d (Johnson et al, 2004 p 26). Just as trust is important,\nethical behaviour in the dyad has been identified as a prerequisite for successful long-term\nrelationships (Carter, 2000). Related to the development of trust, several other researchers\nhave stressed the need for both parties in the relationship to clarify expectations carefully.\nLanderos et al (1995) stated that expectations should be linked to performance measures.\nOpen communications are essential to successful co-operations (Stuart, 1997). Commu-\nnications should include the sharing of not only production planning and control data (Spina\nand Zotteri, 2000) but also information on product innovation (Primo and Amundson, 2002).\nCarr and Pearson (1999) showed that communications should be frequent and cover strategic\nissues. Partnership-like relationships provide an atmosphere of trust where such open com-\nmunications are possible.\n7The time and mutual effort required to achieve close relationships should not be under-\nestimated. Substantial resources are required to successfully manage partnership-like relation-\nships (Dwyer et al., 1987; Simpson and Mayo, 1997). A (rare) longitudinal study, by Spina\nand Zotteri (2000), showed that negotiations on how the benefits of joint cost-saving pro-\ngrammes will be shared should best be conducted up-front. Subsequently, this allows the\nmain efforts in the relationship to be focused on effective problem solving, rather than pro-\ntracted discussions on how savings should be divided. Although this study was based on a\nsingle case, it does indicate the effort required of both parties and the inevitable problems that\nmust be addressed in integrating operational and product development activities.\nIt is somewhat surprising that although close, partnership-like relationships have domi-\nnated how the supplier base has been viewed by both practitioners and academics over the last\ndecade, the exact nature of such relationships is still unclear.\n2.3 The nature of close relationships\nIn 1995 Wilson stated, \u201cour knowledge about [supplier] relationships is at an early stage. We\nneed to improve our concept definitions\u201d (1995, p343). There has been research into supplier\nrelationships over the past ten years but relatively little that sheds light on the nature of part-\nnership-like relationships. The relationship between a manufacturer and supplier can take\nmany forms and the distinguishing factors have been identified as the number of transactions,\nthe longevity of the relationship, and the closeness.\nRelationships have been perceived to be on a continuum ranging from purely discrete\ntransactions, through repeated transactions, to long-term relationships, to full partnerships\n(Mohr and Nevin, 1990; Webster, 1992). Focusing only on the number of transactions ignores\n8the fact that commodity components may be sourced regularly from a supplier without a close\nrelationship being developed (or necessary).\nLambert et al. (1996) proposed that there are three kinds of partnerships, depending on\ntheir \u201cshort-term\u201d (Type 1), \u201clong-term\u201d (Type 2) and \u201clong-term with no-end\u201d (Type 3)\ncharacter (see Figure I). Although it is helpful to use the time dimension to differentiate be-\ntween partnership types, in practice, it cannot be assumed that a manufacturer and supplier in\na long-term relationship see themselves in partnership. It could be that the manufacturer has\npurchased the product from the supplier for several years due to a consistently low price and\nthe relationship may not go anywhere beyond the placing of an order and its delivery. There-\nfore, the time dimension offers an insufficient explanation of partnerships but Lambert et al\u2019s\ndiagram does indicate that joint ventures and other formal business relationships should be\ndifferentiated from how the term partnership is applied to supplier relationships.\nTake in Figure I\n\u201cCloseness\u201d has been widely identified as an important characteristic of relationships.\nLambert et al. (1996) contended that partnerships are closer than other types of relationships,\nand Ellram (1991) defined partnerships in terms of \u201cclose sharing relationships.\u201d Similarly,\nMacbeth (1998) perceived partnerships as contrasting strongly with \u201cdistant relationships.\u201d\nAccording to Ford (1984), manufacturers and their suppliers emphasize close relationships\nand closeness can be explained in terms of five dimensions: geographical, the length of the\nrelationship, technological, cultural, and social. Homburg (1995) argued that a clear definition\nof relationship closeness and a way of measuring the degree of closeness are lacking. Al-\nthough a number of researchers agree that partnership-like relationships are close relation-\n9ships, the opportunity for using closeness as the basis for an empirical investigation of rela-\ntionships is open (Ellram, 1991; Saxton, 1997).\nSeveral researchers have proposed definitions, or identified attributes of partnership-like\nrelationships. These vary greatly in the attributes they identify, ranging from expressions of\nwhat they achieve (e.g. Landeros, et al., 1995), to vague concepts such as a \u201cmeeting of\nminds\u201d (Ellram and Hendrick, 1995). For example, Brennan\u2019s definition is \u201cpartnership im-\nplies that: a single supplier now has a better understanding of the customer\u2019s requirements;\nthe supplier has committed resources, financial, physical and human, to meeting the specific\nneeds of the customer; the two partners operate more effectively with each other than with\noutsiders\u2026 the very fact of the existence of a partnership immediately implies some degree of\nmutual dependency\u2026 there are real economic advantages\u201d (Brennan, 1997, pp769-770). This\ndefinition was based on the results of semi-structured interviews. Ellram and Hendrick (1995)\ntook a different approach. Prior to their empirical investigation they defined partnership as\n\u201can on-going relationship between two firms that involves a commitment over an extended\ntime period, and a mutual sharing of information and the risks and rewards of the relation-\nship\u201d (pp41-42). Table 1 summarizes the different views on the nature of partnership-like re-\nlationships in the literature\uf0beit covers papers which focused on supplier-manufacturer rela-\ntionships and were published in operations management journals in the last ten years (mainly\nin the years following Wilson\u2019s statement that our knowledge of relationships is limited).\nIt can be seen from Table 1 that only two of the attributes in Ellram and Hendrik\u2019s defi-\nnition correspond to those of Brennan. The variation in the attributes identified by different\nresearchers lends support to our view that partnership-like relationships are context specific\n(and both practitioners and researchers have applied the term to quite a wide range of different\nrelationships).\n10\nTake in Table 1\nEach of the attributes identified listed alphabetically in Table 1 has been given a refer-\nence number, e.g. \u201cL3\u201d (which indicates the third attribute suggested by the literature). Com-\nmitment (L1), dependency (L5), the level of information sharing (L8), and the longevity of\npartnerships (L10) are the attributes that are most commonly identified (and these are high-\nlighted in Table 1). The advantages resulting from partnership-like relationships\uf0bemainly\nprice reduction, and quality and delivery performance improvements\uf0beare widely recognized.\nIt can be seen that definitions sometimes mix the nature of partnership-like relationships with\nthe advantages that such relationships can bring.\nIt should be noted that the research in six of the papers summarized in Table 1 did not\nempirically investigate the attributes of partnership directly. For example, McCutcheon and\nStuart (2000) did not identify attributes empirically but operationalized the ones they chose in\ninvestigating the sorts of suppliers that are best suited for partnership. This type of approach is\nnot unusual; Fynes and Voss (2002) also did not derive their attributes empirically but used\nthem to investigate the influence of partnership on quality performance.\n2.4 Conclusions from the literature\nFrom the extant literature we conclude:\n1) Partnership-like relationships are close co-operations between manufacturers and their\nsuppliers, which bring many advantages including better quality, lower costs and reliable\ndelivery;\n2) Creating and maintaining such relationships is resource intensive;\n11\n3) Partnership-like relationships are not appropriate for the whole of the supplier base;\n4) A wide variety of attributes have been identified by different researchers. This indicates\nthat partnership-like relationships are context dependent and not an absolute concept.\n5) Much of our knowledge on the nature of supplier relationships is not backed with empiri-\ncal evidence;\n6) Since the term \u201cpartnership\u201d has been used equivocally, a novel approach for investigat-\ning the nature of relationships is necessary. \u201cCloseness\u201d has potential as a vehicle for in-\nvestigating partnership-like relationships.\n3. Methodology\nFrom the literature, it was clear that there is a need for an empirical study of the nature of\nsupplier-manufacturer relationships and the research question for this exploratory study was:\n\uf0a7 What do managers perceive as the main attributes of close manufacturer-supplier rela-\ntionships?\nIn investigating relationships, researchers have typically used postal surveys with pre-defined\nnotions of \u201cpartnerships\u201d (e.g., Ellram and Hendrick, 1995; Saxton, 1997). Since different\nmanagers use the term partnership very differently, a further postal survey would risk collect-\ning inaccurate or equivocal information. After empirical studies that have relied on large sam-\nple survey instruments (as indicated by Table 1), a new approach is required at this stage of\ntheory development to provide additional insights and a fresh perspective.\nIn-depth interviews have been recognized as particularly useful in studying supplier re-\nlationships (McCutcheon and Stuart, 2000). However, previous interview-based research has\n12\nshown that direct questioning has serious limitations for investigating relationships (Lemke et\nal., 2003). This is illustrated by Table 2, which classifies the answers from purchasing manag-\ners to a direct question on their relationships with suppliers. For example, fourteen simply an-\nswered that their relationships were \u201cgood\u201d and nine that they were \u201cpartnerships\u201d (ibid).\nThere is a need to probe deeper than answers based on clich\u00e9s, such as \u201cpartnerships\u201d. A new\napproach was needed to avoid the limitations of direct questioning and repertory grid tech-\nnique was chosen, as it is a powerful research tool for probing interviewees\u2019 understanding of\ncomplex topics, particularly relationships.\nTake in Table 2\n3.1. Repertory grid technique\nRepertory grid enables respondents to articulate their views on complex issues and pushes\nthem beyond the use of jargon. It is particularly appropriate in studies where interviewees find\nit hard to articulate their opinions with clarity (Hussey and Hussey, 1997). The technique is a\nform of structured interviewing which was originally developed in the 1950s by the psy-\nchologist George Kelly. It is a highly effective tool for exploratory management research\n(Goffin, 2002).\nTo understand the technique, we will describe one grid elicited during our own research\n(from a manager in the electronics industry, coded Interviewee 16-2). The interviewee was\nasked to name nine suppliers with which they work, three in \u201cclose\u201d relationships, three in\n\u201cdistant\u201d, and three in \u201caverage\u201d relationships. Each of the suppliers\u2019 names was written on a\nseparate postcard-sized card, which had been randomly numbered in advance. The inter-\nviewee was then presented with a random set of three cards (termed a \u201ctriad\u201d in repertory grid\n13\nterminology) and asked: \u201cwhy is working with two of these suppliers similar and different\nfrom working with the third?\u201d From the many combinations possible, triads should be se-\nlected to include strongly contrasting elements (Bender, 1974) and an explanation of this can\nbe found in Goffin (2002.) The interviewee\u2019s response\u2014termed a \u201cconstruct\u201d\u2014was that one\nof the suppliers has reliable \u201cdelivery on-time\u201d, whereas the shipments from the other two\nwere often \u201cdelayed\u201d. After this first construct was identified, each of the nine suppliers was\nrated against it on a 5-point scale [with 1 \u201cvery good\u201d, 3 \u201cneutral\u201d, and 5 \u201cvery poor\u201d, as rec-\nommended by Tindall (1994), and Gammack and Stephens (1994)]. Further triads are used to\nidentify additional constructs. Interviewees were not allowed to repeat constructs and so each\nnew triad elicited a new construct, thus stimulating the interviewee to think more and more\ndeeply about supplier relationships as the interview progressed. Care was taken to ensure that\neach construct was expressed in the form of a word or a phrase, whatever came most naturally\nto the respondent (Levy and Dugan, 1956). As each construct was identified, open-ended\nquestions were used to probe its meaning so as to achieve a mutual understanding (Drew,\n1995). Repertory grid technique allows meanings to be understood in an unbiased way as the\ndiscussions are based on the elements (i.e. suppliers) and the constructs (i.e. attributes of sup-\nplier relationships) raised by the interview themselves. The interviews were recorded so that\nclose attention could be paid to the respondents\u2019 own explanations (Charmaz, 1995).\nTake in Figure II\nFor every construct, the interviewee rated the nine suppliers\u2019 on the 1-5 rating scale and\nthese ratings form the grid shown in Figure II. This shows that ten constructs were elicited\nfrom Interviewee 16-2, including \u201cdelivery on-time\u201d, \u201cproduct quality\u201d and \u201cearly informa-\n14\ntion\u201d. The ratings of the elements on \u201cearly information\u201d illustrate that the respondent differ-\nentiates strongly between the performances of each of their suppliers on this construct (ratings\nrange from \u201c1\u201d for Suppliers 1 and 5, to \u201c5\u201d for Supplier 4). In contrast, the ratings of the\nelements on \u201cproduct quality\u201d illustrate that the respondent does not distinguish strongly be-\ntween the performance of suppliers; the ratings only vary from \u201c1\u201d (e.g., Supplier 1) to \u201c3\u201d\n(e.g., Supplier 2). \u201cVariability\u201d is a mathematical measure of the spread of ratings on a par-\nticular construct that can be used to help identify more important constructs (Smith, 1986).\nOverall, repertory grid stimulates interviewees to think deeply about relationships and move\nbeyond answers based on their immediate reactions and the use of jargon (especially as the\nterm \u201cpartnership\u201d was avoided).\n3.2 Sample\nMany German writers have acknowledged the importance of supplier management in Ger-\nmany (e.g. Homburg, 1995; Nachtweh, 1998) and that close supplier relationships are a criti-\ncal success factor (e.g. Boutellier and Alwin, 1996; Snijder, 1996). Therefore, Germany was\nchosen as a suitable national context in which to investigate supplier relationships (and one in\nwhich there has been little previous empirical research). The repertory grid interviews formed\npart of a larger programme of research into supplier management at German manufacturing\ncompanies and was linked to the International Best Factory Awards programme. This pro-\ngramme has been described previously (New and Szwejczewski, 1995) and has been the basis\nfor a wide range of investigations of manufacturing performance. A previous study of supplier\nmanagement took a database of 110 (mainly mid-sized) German manufactures as its starting\npoint and then conducted telephone interviews with a stratified random sub-sample of 34\ncompanies in three sectors (Lemke et al., 2000). In the current study, we contacted 28 of these\n15\ncompanies (i.e. those in the electronics and engineering sectors) and 18 agreed to participate\nin the research (corresponding to a response of 64%). The 18 companies represented German\nmedium-sized companies, which had an average of 450 employees and an average turnover of\n8.7 million Euros (approximately $8.7M) and were deemed suitable as an exploratory sample.\nIn engineering, the automotive industry was well represented as this is a major sector in Ger-\nmany.\nTake in Table 3\nA multiple respondent approach is useful in research (Stuart, 1997) and so two or more\nrespondents per company \u2013 normally the purchasing and production manager or managing\ndirector - were interviewed separately (see Table 3). (As many of the sample companies were\nsmall, the managing director often had responsibility for dealing with suppliers.) This\nmatched well with repertory grid methodology, where it is normal to interview 30 or more\npeople to identify a full set of constructs. It can be argued that manufacturers dominate the\nrelationship with their suppliers, since they select suppliers and place orders. For this reason,\nthe research at this stage focused exclusively on the views of managers from the manufac-\nturer\u2019s side. Taking a dyadic approach and contrasting the views of manufacturers with those\nof suppliers would be a fertile area for further research.\n3.3 Analysis of data\nThe grids and interview transcripts provided a rich pool of qualitative and quantitative data.\nThe analysis was based on three steps (following recommendations in the methodology litera-\nture):\n16\n\uf0a7 Collation of the common constructs. The verbal explanations of constructs (i.e., attributes)\nprovided by each of the interviewees were analyzed. Two researchers (both fluent in Ger-\nman) reviewed the transcripts independently and interpreted the constructs. A high degree\nof correlation was found between the interpretations of the two researchers. Construct la-\nbels were defined, using where possible the most common terms from the respondents.\n\uf0a7 Identification of full construct listing. Once the construct labels had been identified, this\nallowed identical constructs to be identified, and the frequency of mention of each con-\nstruct was determined across the 39 interviews.\n\uf0a7 Identification of key constructs. The combination of frequency and variability was used to\nidentify the most important constructs.\n4. Results\nA native speaker conducted the interviews in the year 2000. Over forty-six hours of on-site\ninterviews were conducted, using the repertory grid technique and semi-structured questions\nto collect background data. On average each interview elicited 10.54 constructs (more than\nwould have resulted from direct questioning).\n4.1. Collation of common constructs\nFrom the 39 repertory grid interviews, a total of 411 constructs were elicited. Many of these\nwere common, i.e. constructs that were mentioned by several respondents (e.g. \u201cnew product\ndevelopment\u201d). To demonstrate how the constructs were collated, Table 4 gives two con-\nstructs with two example quotes from respondents and the assigned labels. The words under-\nlined in each quote indicate how the construct labels were derived.\n17\nIt can be seen that the construct \u201cflexibility\u201d was elicited from 23 of the interviewees\n(59% of total). From these quotes, it can be seen that the respondents themselves used the\nword \u201cflexible\u201d. An analysis of the transcripts showed that all 23 respondents actually used\nthe words \u201cflexible\u201d or \u201cflexibility\u201d and so the latter was chosen as a label.\nTake in Table 4\nThe allocation of construct labels is not always as clear as in the case of flexibility.\nRespondents may use different terms in referring to the same issue and therefore the re-\nsearcher must group these constructs under a suitable label. From Table 4 it can be seen that\n\u201cJoint Problem Solving\u201d was the label assigned to a construct mentioned by six respondents.\nFrom the example quotes it can be seen that one respondent referred to solving problems\n\u2018jointly\u2019 whereas another referred to solving problems \u2018together\u2019.\n4.2. Identification of full construct listing\nIn summarizing the 411 constructs elicited, we have listed all 26 constructs that were men-\ntioned by at least 5 respondents in Table 5. This also shows the frequency of mention and\nvariability. The most commonly elicited construct was flexibility (from 23 respondents) fol-\nlowed by delivery performance (from 20 respondents). Each of the constructs (i.e. attributes)\nhas been given a reference number, such as \u201cE2\u201d, to designate it as an empirically derived at-\ntribute number two.\nTake in Table 5\n18\nIt can be seen that the constructs elicited from respondents cover a range of factors.\nSome are related to the supplier\u2019s organization (e.g. size and capability); the relationship itself\n(e.g. its duration; whether it has a personal component or whether it is only business-related;\nhow well it is maintained); the strategic value of the relationship to the manufacturer; and per-\nformance measures (e.g. quality and delivery performance). The wide range of attributes indi-\ncates the complexity of supplier relationships. Grouping the attributes into suitable categories\ncould enhance our understanding of partnership-like relationships and we will return to this\npoint later.\n4.3 Identification of key constructs\nThe frequency count necessary for identifying important constructs is left open for interpreta-\ntion in the repertory grid literature. Therefore, a decision was taken that a construct that has\nbeen mentioned by at least 25% of the respondents (i.e., by 10 or more) carries more impor-\ntance in explaining supplier relationships than constructs less frequently mentioned con-\nstructs. The constructs that fulfil this requirement are indicated by their frequencies being\nhighlighted in the third column of Table 5 and there are 14 important constructs (numbers 1-\n14) using the 25% criterion. In contrast, the bottom 12 constructs in the table, which were\nmentioned less than 10 times, are unlikely to be important ones.\nFrequency is one indication of importance. Nevertheless, a high frequency of mention\ncan also indicate that a construct was obvious and therefore readily mentioned. Variability is\nanother indication of importance. A construct with a wide spread of ratings differentiates\nstrongly between the elements and this spread (relative to the other constructs) is a construct\u2019s\nvariability. The variability of the constructs in each grid was calculated using FlexiGrid 6; a\nsoftware tool for analyzing individual grids.\n19\nThe variability measure is dependent on the number of constructs in an individual grid.\nFor instance, if 5 constructs were elicited from a respondent, the average variability would be\n20 per cent (i.e., 100\/5), whereas if 10 constructs were elicited, the average variability would\nbe 10 per cent. Therefore, the variability figures of constructs from grids with different num-\nbers of constructs need to be normalized. This was done by multiplying the variability of each\nconstruct by the number of constructs in that individual grid divided by the average number of\nconstructs across all of the respondents\uf0be10.54. The normalized variability figures for a con-\nstruct were then averaged across the grids.\nAs there were on average 10.54 constructs elicited per interview, the average variability\nper construct was 9.49 (i.e. 100 \/ 10.54). A construct with an average normalized variability\n(ANV) greater than 9.49 means that the construct differentiates more strongly between the\nthree supplier groups (i.e. close, average, and distant), while a construct with an ANV less\nthan 9.49 indicates that the construct differentiates less strongly between the three supplier\ngroups. The 14 constructs (numbers 3,4,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,16,19,23,24, and 25) that have\nhigher than average variability are highlighted in the forth column of Table 6.\nThe construct \u201cflexibility\u201d (E1) has a frequency of 23 but an ANV of 8.21. This shows\nthat flexibility is readily mentioned by manufacturers but that most of their suppliers are\nflexible. In other words, the suppliers were rated similarly on the flexibility construct. The\nconstruct \u201cspecial product capability\u201d (E4) has both a high frequency (17) and a high ANV\n(12.76) and so can be designated a key attribute. Using the combination of frequency and\nvariability, nine key constructs were identified, as indicated by the right-hand column in Ta-\nble 5 (construct numbers 3,4,6,7,8,9,11,12 and 13). These are the attributes that most clearly\ndifferentiate between the suppliers where the relationship is close and those where it is dis-\ntant.\n20\nSeveral of the attributes in Table 5 raise interesting points: \u201cflexibility\u201d (E1), delivery\nperformance\u201d (E2), \u201cquality\u201d (E5), and \u201cprice level\u201d (E10) are mentioned often but do not have\nhigh ANV (8.21; 6.83; 6.76; and 4.93 respectively). This finding shows that although these\nfactors were mentioned by a large number of respondents, they do not differentiate strongly\nbetween the performance of each of the different suppliers. Another way of looking at this is\nthat it indicates that the factors flexibility, delivery performance, quality and price are now\nhygiene factors and suppliers need to provide a full service and not just good performance on\nthese factors. Another interesting result is \u201ctrust\u201d. This is often mentioned in the literature so\nit is surprising that it was only elicited empirically from two respondents (and so is not listed\nin Table 5, which only shows constructs from five or more respondents). A possible explana-\ntion for this is that trust is a high level attribute and the research has uncovered attributes on a\ndeeper level that managers use as a proxy for trust. This would mean that the \u201ctrust\u201d between\na supplier and a manufacturer is perceived in terms of \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d (E3), \u201crelation-\nship maintenance\u201d (E8) and \u201creliability\u201d (E20), although the German cultural context could be\na contributory factor here). This appears to be an important area for future research.\n5. Discussion\n5.1 Comparison of empirical evidence with the literature\nThe current research identified a wide range of attributes, of which nine were identified to be\nparticularly important in contrasting between close and other forms of supplier relationships.\nIt is useful to further our understanding by comparing the empirically elicited factors to those\nin the extant literature.\nFigure III is a Venn diagram of the attributes of supplier relationships from both the lit-\nerature and the current study, with the key attributes highlighted. It can be seen that 12 attrib-\n21\nutes are identified in the literature but were not found in the empirical investigation. These\ninclude \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d (L2) and \u201ctrust\u201d (L18), etc. This could be explained in that\nsome of the terms used in the literature may not match the jargon used by practitioners. This\ndemonstrates the confusion in the terminology of relationships\uf0bethere is a need for unequivo-\ncal definitions of the attributes.\nTake in Figure III\nEight attributes were identified in both the literature and this empirical study. These in-\nclude \u201ccommitment\u201d (L1; E12) and \u201cdelivery performance\u201d (L4; E2). Two attributes that were\nidentified in the literature were found in the empirical study to be particularly important: \u201cde-\npendency\u201d (L5; E6) and \u201cNPD and innovation\u201d (L17; E12).\nNineteen attributes were identified in the research but were not in the literature. These\ninclude for example \u201cflexibility\u201d (E1) and \u201clocation\u201d (E14). Obviously, there could be some\nlinkage to the attributes in the literature, such as \u201cco-operation\u201d (L3). However, our under-\nstanding of the terms in the literature is still too limited to draw such conclusions. The mean-\nings of the empirically identified attributes are clear, since the repertory grid methodology\nelicited detailed explanations. Appendix A documents the meanings of the nine most impor-\ntant constructs, with example quotes from the respondents. Of these nine, only \u201cdependency\u201d\n(L5; E6) and \u201cNPD and innovation\u201d (L17; E12) were in the extant literature.\n5.2 A tentative conceptual model\nAlthough the comparison of the listings of attributes from this research to the extant literature\ndiscussed in Section 5.1 gives us some insights, Figure III does little to explain the interrela-\n22\ntionships between the attributes listed. There is a need to categorize attributes and identify\npossible links between them. Figure IV shows a conceptual model of how supplier relation-\nships develop, which is based on both the literature and our empirical study. This model clas-\nsifies the multiplicity of attributes into five categories and takes ideas from the work of Fynes\nand Voss (2002) and McCutcheon and Stuart (2000).\nTake in Figure IV\nBefore partnership is possible, selection is a necessary component. Based on the sup-\nplier\u2019s \u201ccompetencies\u201d, selection is made and then detailed \u201ccommunication\u201d can take place.\nThis communication leads to both \u201cperformance improvements\u201d and \u201cbuilding trust\u201d. The\nperformance \u201cimprovements\u201d also support the building of trust and lead to short-term \u201cre-\nturns\u201d (e.g. quality improvements). As trust increases and time passes, \u201cpartnership-like rela-\ntionships\u201d can be achieved, which leads to greater rewards for both parties. It can be noted\nthat each of the attributes of supplier relationships has been integrated into the model and the\nhigher order constructs, such as \u201csupplier\u2019s competences\u201d have been linked to related, lower\nlevel, attributes.\nThe first of the higher order constructs\uf0be \u201csupplier\u2019s competences\u201d\uf0be is similar to\n\u201cdesirability\u201d in McCutcheon and Stuart\u2019s terminology (2000). In our tentative model, \u201csup-\nplier\u2019s competences\u201d includes well-known factors such as \u201cquality\u201d (L13; E5), \u201cprice\u201d (L12;\nE10) and \u201cdelivery performance\u201d (L4; E2). Additionally, factors such as supplier flexibility and\njoint problem solving are important. However, two attributes of competence \u201cspecial product\ncapability\u201d (E4) and \u201cnew product development\u201d (L17; E12) differentiate most strongly be-\n23\ntween potential partners and non-partners and so this is indicated by the highlighting on Fig-\nure IV.\n\u201cCommunication\u201d is an enabler of trust and, in turn, partnership. The attributes of this\nhigh order construct include the \u201cfeedback\u201d (E11) and \u201cinformation shared\u201d (L8) (both opera-\ntional and strategic communications) being channelled through clearly \u201cdesignated contacts\u201d\n(E26) in both companies. \u201cTrust\u201d is one of the most commonly discussed high order constructs\nof partnership in the literature but our research has indicated that it is related to factors such as\n\u201ccommitment\u201d (L1; E19) and the \u201cimportance of the supplier\u201d (E16) to the manufacturer. The\nfactors that most strongly characterize \u201ctrust\u201d in partnerships are indicated by highlighting\n(e.g. \u201cdependency\u201d). \u201cPartnership-like relationships\u201d take time to achieve and are character-\nized for instance by \u201cshared risks\u201d (L14) and active \u201crelationship maintenance\u201d (E8).\n6. Conclusions\n6.1 Limitations\nThe sample was relatively small and not representative of German industry as a whole (e.g. it\ncovered companies with an average size of 450 employees). Therefore, we need to be cau-\ntious in how we interpret the implications of the results. The research did not explore the sup-\nplier\u2019s view of relationships. A dyadic approach would almost certainly lead to more insights;\nThe analysis followed the recommendations in the repertory grid methodology literature\nand concentrated on identifying similarity \u2013 the important constructs from across the whole\nsample. Although outside the scope of this paper, the rich data could now be analyzed focus-\ning on the differences between individuals\u2019 perceptions and the common ones of the sample.\nThe comparison of empirically derived attributes and those in the literature was prone to\ndifficulty, as many of the terms in the literature have not been defined. This opens opportuni-\n24\nties for researchers to use techniques such as factor analysis to further our understanding.\nSimilarly, the grouping of attributes to higher-level constructs is tentative and needs empirical\nverification.\nTaking the limitations into account, we believe that the contribution of our research is\nthat it both demonstrates the viability of a new method for investigating supplier relationships\nand provides exploratory data. The results have implications for both practice and research.\n6.2 Viable methodology\nThe power of the repertory grid approach is illustrated by the contrast between the attributes\nof supplier relationships derived by direct questioning in previous research (Table 2) and\nthose from repertory grid (Table 5). Table 2 shows that many respondents used the term part-\nnership, which has already been identified in the literature as meaning different things to dif-\nferent people. Therefore, direct questioning has serious limitations in the study of supplier re-\nlationships. Even if follow-up questions had been used, direct questioning has a higher risk of\nintroducing interviewer bias. Repertory grid technique produced extensive qualitative data on\nthe meanings of interviews\u2019 terms and their rating of suppliers on the different attributes. It\nshould be noted that 18 of the managers who were posed the direct question about their sup-\nplier relationships in a telephone interview were later personally interviewed using repertory\ngrid technique and so the data for a one-to-one comparison of the results from the two ap-\nproaches is available (although an analysis of this data is outside the scope of this paper).\n6.3 Key exploratory results\nAlthough the data are exploratory in nature, they help us to start to have a clearer understand-\ning of relationships. Specifically Figure IV provides a tentative means for avoiding the confu-\n25\nsion that has evolved in the literature and in practice about the nature of partnership-like rela-\ntionships. It enables us to differentiate between the variety of conditions that lead to, affect or\ncharacterize close relationships.\nThe data clearly show that certain attributes of suppliers\u2019 performance are more im-\nportant than others. For example, the data demonstrate that suppliers typically have similar\nperformance levels on the factors \u201cflexibility\u201d, \u201cdelivery performance\u201d, \u201cquality\u201d, and\n\u201cprice\u201d. This empirically demonstrates that, to be successful, suppliers need to treat these as\nhygiene factors and concentrate on offering a full service. The results provide a clear explana-\ntion of the meanings of the attributes practitioners use to explain relationships (see the listing\nin the Appendix). Clarity in such terms is important if we are to avoid the type of confusion\nthat has arisen around \u201cpartnership\u201d.\nFor most manufacturers the supplier base will consist of a portfolio of different rela-\ntionships. A close relationship is not appropriate for every supplier. Recognizing this and pri-\noritizing the resources needed for full partnership-like relationships is an aspect that emerges\nfrom our research but which needs further work.\n6.4 Implications for practitioners\nThe literature extols the advantages of partnership-like relationships but, as shown in our re-\nview, such relationships require significant resources and are not always appropriate. The\ncombination of insights from both the literature and our data has implications for both suppli-\ners and manufacturers.\nOnly certain suppliers should be selected for the development of partnership-like rela-\ntionships. The selection criteria should be based on both the components involved and the\nsupplier\u2019s competences (particularly their capability to contribute to new product develop-\n26\nment and special products), as indicated by Figure IV. It is important to note that some of\nthese criteria had not been identified in the literature before but obviously a wider sample is\nrequired to confirm the importance of these factors. Establishing whether a supplier really has\nthe necessary competences should reduce the risk of investing significant resources in devel-\noping the relationship, only to find that the supplier is unsuitable. Figure IV also indicates the\ntype of communications that need to be established and how mutual trust should be achieved.\nThe identification of attributes which clearly differentiate close relationships is useful infor-\nmation for manufacturers looking to optimize the management of the portfolio of relation-\nships in their supplier base.\nThe results show that suppliers cannot rely solely on offering high quality products, de-\nlivering them on-time and at a reasonable price, if their strategy is to be more than a commod-\nity supplier. In order to be attractive to a manufacturer, suppliers need to ensure that they are\nable to offer a range of \u201ccompetences\u201d. Once selected, Figure IV indicates the areas on which\nthey should concentrate in communications and building trust. The wide range of factors to be\nconsidered is important.\n6.5 Implications for researchers\nThe authors believe that the study has unearthed a rich vein for further study. The key topics\nare:\n\uf0a7 The results of our research urgently need to be verified using a wider, representative sam-\nple (and, if required, copies of the repertory grid data collection instruments are available\nfrom the authors);\n\uf0a7 There is a need to look for differences in the dyad, i.e. how suppliers view the selection\nand partnership development process;\n27\n\uf0a7 The selection criteria for potential partners need to be understood better. Conjoint analysis\ncould be used to understand the trade-offs manufacturers make in choosing their partners.\nThe particular importance of the two factors \u201cspecial products\u201d and \u201cnew product devel-\nopment\u201d indicated by repertory grid analysis could then be verified;\n\uf0a7 Only one case study has previously investigated the longitudinal aspects of developing\npartnerships (Spina and Zotteri, 2000). The framework offered by Figure IV could be in-\nvestigated using a longitudinal case study approach. This could lead to a better understand-\ning of the complex process of transforming transactional relationships into partnership-like\nones;\n\uf0a7 A \u201cportfolio\u201d of relationships is appropriate in the supplier base (Petroni and Panciroli,\n2002). Empirical evidence is needed on the number of transactional relationships (\u201cdis-\ntant\u201d), \u201caverage\u201d relationships, \u201crelationships in development\u201d and \u201cpartnership-like rela-\ntionships\u201d which are typically found in manufacturers\u2019 portfolios. This research has previ-\nously not been viable as the understanding of \u201cpartnership\u201d has been too ambiguous;\n\uf0a7 The cultural context of Germany may well have influenced the results. Therefore, as the\nviability of the methodology for investigating the complex topic of supplier-manufacturer\npartnerships has been demonstrated, replication is required in the US and other countries\nwith a strong manufacturing base.\nFor too long our knowledge of manufacturer-supplier relationships has been clouded by the\nequivocal use of the term \u201cpartnership\u201d. We believe that this paper has made a contribution to\nthe understanding of what is one of the most challenging aspects of supply chain manage-\nment\uf0bedeveloping an appropriate set of relationships with suppliers. However, much still re-\nmains to be done.\n28\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the support of xxxxxxxxxx in the preparation of this\npaper.

Good\n\u201cIf you asked me directly, I can tell you that the relation-\nships with our suppliers are very good\u201d (Purchasing Man-\nager in Engineering).\n14\n2. Partnership-like \u201cOur relationships are partnership-like, which sums it uppretty much\u201d (Purchasing Manager in Process). 9\n3. Co-operative\n\u201cWe are co-operative and this in objective terms. So,\nworking together does not only mean speaking about\nthings \u2013 joint actions are needed\u2026 It is a co-operative\neffort and meetings are scheduled on a regular basis\u201d\n(Purchasing Manager in Engineering).\n5\n4. Normal \/ Reason-\nable\n\u201cOur relationships are normal and based on what any\npurchasing manager would reasonably expect\u201d (Purchas-\ning Manager in Electronics).\n4\n5. Open\n\u201cIn my experience, our relationships are open which al-\nlows us to address issues in an uncomplicated fashion\u201d\n(Managing Director in Engineering).\n3\n6. Understanding \/\nHelpful\n\u201cThe supplier has to understand our problems and has\nalso to be helpful in solving these. I have the feeling that\nthese are the suppliers anybody should look out for\u201d\n(Managing Director in Electronics).\n3\n7. Goal Directed \/\nProfit focus\n\u201cThe bottom-line is the goal in our business and so, the\nsupplier relationship has to measure up against profit.\u201d\n(Purchasing Manager in Electronics).\n4\n8. Human Factor is\nimportant \/ Cli-\nmate of trust\n\u201cWe developed our relationships in a way that we were\nable to establish a climate of trust. The \u2018human factor\u2019 is\nvery important to us.\u201d (Purchasing Manager in Engineer-\ning).\n2\n9. Close\n\u201cOur relationships are\u2026 close\u2026 in my view, being close\nmeans that different functions should work together on\nseveral level.\u201d (Managing Director in Engineering).\n1\n10. Direct\n\u201cOur relationship is not so much on an organisational\nlevel, but even more so, on a one-to-one basis. Hence, the\ncontact is very direct\u201d (Managing Director in Process).\n1\n11. Liberal\n\u201cWe are highly liberal. Yes, we want to earn money, but I\ndon\u2019t have any advantage if an excellent supplier cannot\ndeliver components in two years time. Based on our under-\nstanding, there is always a way around problems\u201d (Man-\naging Director in Engineering).\n1\n12. Long-term per-\nspective\n\u201cOur relationships are built for the long-term and are\ntherefore sealed with a long-term contract\u201d (Managing\nDirector in Process).\n1\n13. Fair \/ \u201cGiving and\nTaking\u201d\n\u201cIn general, the relationship has something to do with\n\u2018giving and taking.\u2019 For instance, sometimes we forget to\norder parts on time and the supplier sends an unscheduled\nlorry on his expenses. At another time, I will order parts\nfrom my preferred supplier although another source could\nbe considered. This is just fair and this situation I would\ndescribe as \u2018giving and taking\u2019\u201d (Purchasing Manager in\nElectronics).\n1\nTotal 49\n40\nTable 3: Sample for Repertory Grid Interviews.\nInterviewees\u2019 Function Engineering Electronics Total\nPurchasing Manager 10 4 14\nManaging Director 4 6 10\nProduction Manager 5 1 6\nQuality Manager 3 3 6\nLogistics Manager 1 1 2\nR&D \/ Purchasing Manager 1 1\nTotal 23 Total 16 Total 39\n41\nTable 4: How Constructs were Collated and Labels Assigned.\nConstruct\nNo2.\nConstruct\nLabel Poles Example Respondents\u2019 Explanations\nFre-\nquency\nE1 Flexibility\nFlexible (1);\nInflexible\n(5)\n\u201cA flexible supplier is prepared to work on weekends to fulfil\na short-termed order of us. The supplier is able to quickly\nproduce and deliver the parts. Other suppliers, inflexible ones,\nare unable to fulfil these wishes\u201d (Electronics; MD).\n\u201cIf we order something under a very short notice \u2013 let\u2019s say\non a Friday \u2013 the supplier is so flexible that he even would\nwork on Saturdays and Sundays to deliver the parts on the\nnext business day; so on Monday. The same applies when or-\ndering a small batch of parts. A flexible supplier can deliver\nvarious volume sizes and not only the large ones. An inflexible\nsupplier cannot deliver parts to any other time or in any other\nvolume than what has been agreed in the contract long ago\u201d\n(Engineering; Purchasing Manager).\n23\nE21\nJoint\nProblem\nSolving\nJointly (1);\nAlone (5)\n\u201cI can call a supplier if I have a problem and I can ask him\ndirectly whether he can help me. Some help me to jointly solve\na problem, others don\u2019t help us at all\u201d (Electronics; MD).\n\u201cSome suppliers help us solving our problems. I really get\nfull support in finding an answer to our problem. I can ring\nthem at any time and I would be certain that we will find a\nway to overcome the problem together. I would also ring an-\nother supplier, but others have obvious difficulties to see our\nproblems from our perspective and therefore, are unable to\nsolve it together with us. I even have to explain to them that I\nneed help in solving the problem; they simply don\u2019t seem to\nunderstand what I mean by it. We always try to explain our\nposition to them, but \u2013 for reasons I am not aware of \u2013 they\nseem to be unable to see the problem and the urgency to solve\nit.
