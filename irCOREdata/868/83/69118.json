Over a year period, interviews were conducted with care \ntraining specialists, carers, clients, and employers across England, including Cumbria, in \nconjunction with literature reviews and observations to develop themes about this \nphenomenon.  Findings revealed that there were many barriers to the carers\u201f adjustment \nand advancement in a new area of settlement, and that these obstacles were complex and \ninvisible to the care sector establishment; while the women\u201fs migration took place over \nphysical borders, there were also hidden socio-economic, cultural, policy, and \u201cpaper \nwalls\u201d (Brinkmann, 2006) that prevented their access to professional jobs, further and \nhigher education, and formal associations. This case study casts many questions about the \ngeographies of skilled migrant women and their roles in transforming the global care \nsector as well as their local communities through their educational capital.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis exploratory study is about the ways education, literacy, and learning operated within \nthe social networks and mobility patterns of professional migrant women who were \ncarers to the elderly in a rural northwest region of England--Cumbria. Using care and \nmigration literature, I describe the situations of women migrants in the care sector, and \nthe development of the care sector in England,\n1\n as part of a global industry. Then, I use \nthe literature, and my findings, to outline Cumbria\u201fs socio-economic position within \nEngland, especially the northern region.  Next, I describe my methodology, and end with \nthemes that I developed from both the literature and my study. The study attempts to \nconnect three distinctive concepts that are rarely brought together in the study of migrant \ncarers: home, work, and education. In this case, \u201eHome\/work,\u201f (the title of this article), \nencompasses five layers of meaning: 1) the intersection of professional women migrants\u201f \nhome and community lives with their work lives and relations; 2) gendered and migrant-\ndependent care in a post-welfare society; 3) the educational capital women bring and \ndevelop, as they migrate from their home countries to work in Cumbria, England; 4) the \ninformal educational and learning strategies (homework) that the women used, and \nfinally, 5) the reflexive account of an economic migrant woman researcher positioned \nwithin the \u201eknowledge-based economy\u201f studying migrant women in the secondary service \nsector (Smith, 2005).  \n \n                                                 \n1\n The study takes place in Cumbria, which is in the northwest region of England, where \ncarers, employees and clients were interviewed and observed. Additionally, interviews \nwith care specialists and literature reviews were made throughout England. Therefore, \nCumbria serves as a case study of the care sector in England, as well as the global care \nphenomenon.  \nCuban, Before proofs, Ethnnography and Education, v3, 1, March 2008, 81-96 \n 2 \nIntersectional Theoretical Framework \nFeminist researchers (Silvey 2005, Ackers 2004, Anderson 2006, Raghurum & Kofman \n2004, Duffy 2007, Kofman et al 2000) have rightly pointed out that gender is neglected \nin labour migration studies, even though this population is predominantly female. They \nhave called for intersectional approaches, factoring interlocking systems (gender, race, \nand class), as they are tied to both migration and reproductive labour. Furthermore, \nMahler & Pessar (2006) discuss women migrants\u201f mobilities, focusing on intersections of \ngeographical and social locations, power, and ideoscapes (symbols). The conventional \ndefinition of mobility (Silvey 2004) is legalistic and rationalistic, with women\u201fs \nmigration configured as a series of discrete events, tied to men\u201fs jobs, rather than a \nprocess that incorporates socio-psychological dynamics (migrating to escape workplace \ndiscrimination, provide for children, or for autonomy), legislation (skills point systems), \nand political aspects (crossing state boundaries and citizenship status) as well as \neconomic strains (structural adjustment programmes, SAP). These researchers focus on \nthe complex reasons for women\u201fs migration, suggesting that it is not simply push and \npull factors (Ackers, 2004). Women\u201fs labour migration is tied to larger structures of \npower\u2014capitalism, patriarchy, and the racial division of labour but also micro levels, \nlike, the household as a workspace for women and work\/life balance (Silvey 2007, Datta \net al 2006). This study concurs, that migrant women have diverse migration paths and \ntrajectories, with numerous factors mediating their experiences. \n \nThe interactionist framework is different from instrumentalist perspectives that highlight \nmigration as a common good; studies, for example, might measure migrants\u201f mobility in \nterms of their human capital and their economic contributions to receiving countries. \nBusinesses share this perspective since a transient migrant labor force allows for \ntransnational control (Pai, 2004). Similarly, government policies support migration, only \nin so far as migrants benefit the economy. A reactionary, ambivalent response takes over \nwith worries that migrants could rely on public funds, draining an already tight supply. \nStricter controls have been incurred on migrants and refugees, affecting their access to \npublic services and encouraging their circular migration rather than settlement; English \nFor Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) programmes, formally free to European Union \n(EU) citizens, for example, started to charge fees in 2007 (see, The Guardian, July 20, \n2007). \n \nRationale \nWhat are absent from both sets of literature are the trajectories of skilled migrant women \nworkers and the educational capital they contribute to the globalised service sector. Little \ndata on this group exists (Kofman 2000, Raghuram & Kofman 2004). While research \nshows that it is skilled women who are often the ones who migrate because they can pay \nthe fees and have skills that are in demand (Cox, 2006) and subsequently, may be easier \nto integrate by the host country (LSC 2006), the primary focus, at least in the media, is on \nunskilled workers, as the \u201emigrant imaginary.\u201f Professional women\u201fs educational \nqualifications, academic resources, and sophisticated language and literacy practices \n(educational capital) are either not factored into the labour equation at all, or, are viewed \ndeficiently (their qualifications are substandard). Because of this reductive focus, \nquestions about why so many professional women are leaving the knowledge-based \nCuban, Before proofs, Ethnnography and Education, v3, 1, March 2008, 81-96 \n 3 \neconomy to work in the secondary service sector and becoming deskilled, in their \u201crace \nto the bottom\u201d are not asked. The literature also does not address regional differences, \nand how migrants adjust to rural areas, or how their experiences, identities, and networks \nmay be different than migrants in London where there are established social services and \nsupport systems as well as places to work. Global cities are the focus (Kofman 2000). \nThirdly, the literature focuses on migrants\u201f \u201cintegration\u201d into the labour market, \nsuggesting that assimilation is a positive outcome. This normative outlook reflects larger \npolicy discourses on migrant labour; the social integration\/cohesion discourse does not \nfactor in the ways that skilled migrants are \u201eupscaling\u201f or professionalizing the labour \nforce, and the central roles they play in transforming social welfare, as well as their \nsymbolic resources. They are strong actors without being credited as such, because, of \ntheir contradictory situation\u2014\u201cwell-educated, low-priced labour\u201d (Momsen 1999, p.10). \nThe fact that an increasing amount of skilled women are entering the care sector \nworkforce, yet with little knowledge about the ways they transform it, as well as their \nlocal communities, with their educational capital, needs to be better understood. \n \nMigrant Women and Care In England \nCare is one of the fastest growing sectors in England today (Cox 2006). In just ten years, \nthe care sector has grown exponentially to match England\u201fs burgeoning ageing \npopulation. The care sector is predominantly female in addition to having one of the \nhighest migrant labour populations (Raghuram & Kofman 2004). With its stigmatized \nimage (as \u201edirty, disposable, and degrading\u201f work) low pay, and the widespread rejection \nof caring jobs by British-born youth, combined with pressures to perform many new and \ndifferent functions, it is widely perceived as a vocation at the bottom of the job ladder, \nand only for those who are desperate. Currently, there are over 200,000 women migrants \nwho work as au pairs  (Cox, 2006), a number of whom are university educated. Although \nthey are called cultural exchange workers, and come on tourist or student visas, they are \nnow part of a migratory domestic service system due to a relaxation of labour and \nmigration laws and government subsidies for the middle-class (to hire students) (Cox \n2006, Pai 2004). Similarly, for the elderly, skilled migrant women make up a good part of \nthe hundreds of thousands of care workers in private, residential, and nursing homes.  \nThey may also come to the UK on student visas or have work permits. It is, perhaps, no \ncoincidence that female skilled migrants are available to work in a growing feminized \nindustry during a period in which there has been a drastic liberalization of care (Cox \n2006). Currently, the dominant delivery system for the elderly is individualised, and they \nnow purchase their own care services. They almost always choose the cheapest option  \n(Milligan 2001). \n \nAlthough the care economy becomes the \u201eshock absorber\u201f of the process of shifting from \ncitizen welfare to the global market, it is less so for the workers themselves, who provide \nthe service (Porter & Judd 2005), and it offers few social protections, and many risks \n(legal, financial, emotional, socio-cultural). Historically, England has had a history of \nservants and maids but migrants have moved into this field in a large-scale way, and are \nspecifically sought for these positions (Cox 2006). Many factors in high-income countries \ncombine to account for the demand: An ageing population (especially those over 85), \nwomen\u201fs career structures which seldom allow for breaks to care, increasingly long hours \nCuban, Before proofs, Ethnnography and Education, v3, 1, March 2008, 81-96 \n 4 \nat work, deregulation of care, and drops in health care coverage. Women family members \nhave traditionally provided care for free or for long hours, with this legacy passed on to \nmigrant workers (Cox 2006).  \n \nMigrant women contribute to the development of high-income families, as well as their \nown families\u201f quality of life, through remittances. When women remit to their families, \nthey also maintain their support roles, as mothers, wives\/partners, sisters, daughters, \nhelping them to survive from a distance (Parrenas 2002). While developing countries  \nrely on these remittances they also experience both \u201ebrain drain\u201f and \u201ecare drain\u201f when \nthese women migrate, and government  policy makers in receiving countries as well as \nbusiness proponents promote these workers as young and transient, unlikely to \u201edrain\u201f the \nNational Health Service (NHS) or the schools. Such policymakers ignore how migrants \nhave contributed greatly to the transition from state-run institutions for the care of the \nelderly to privately subsidized and market-driven care.  \n \nLittle is known about how migrant women create, what  Sassen (2002) calls,  \u201esurvivor \ncircuits\u201f to cope with these globalization trends.  A feminist transnational perspective \n(Naples 2004) focuses on the important ways that women migrants contribute to their \nlocal and global communities, and their \u201etransnational literacy\u201f (Spivak 1992)  as they \nmove around with their educational capital,  negotiating state boundaries and private and \npublic spheres (Mohanty 1997). They enact a participatory and civic citizenship that is \nnot often recognized as such, because it is smaller, by women, and, not in traditional \nplaces (Stromquist 2006).  \n \nThe Care Sector Becomes Professionalized \nCare work has not often been recognized as \u201creal\u201d work and researchers have attempted \nto move it from its familial and emotional connotations in the informal economy (\u201ecare as \na labour of love\u201f)  to situate it within the productive sphere of the labour market (Twigg \n2000). While there has been considerable debate amongst feminists as to whether the \nhome is a workplace for women in the informal economy, less is said about paid care. \nTwigg (2000) has discussed paid care along multiple dimensions: Emotion, labour, \nculture, and body work. Studies of nursing (Brilowski & Wendler  2005), are useful in \nthat they have focused on the occupational concept of care, acknowledging that it has \nchanged from a more humanized to a market-based service focused on cost-savings and \nefficiency. With greater modernization of the health sector, caring has altered and been \nlinked to increasing formal education, literacy, and technologies (Browne & Kirpal \n2005). As nurses are upgraded to diagnosing, the care workers, often, take up their former \nwork, yet with more technical emphasis. The valuation of care work, however, keeps \nchanging. Browne and Kirpal (2003) show that there is a inexhaustible list of skills and \nbehaviors that cannot be accounted for in health care practice, especially as the field \nattempts to integrate expressive (emotion) care with instrumentalist forms of care (the \ncompetency to do paperwork). Furthermore, national vocational qualifications (NVQs) \nare now required by The Care Standards Act of 2000 so that carers comply with health \nand safety measures and this regulation has put pressures on employers and employees to \nsupply appropriate vocational qualifications at a level 2 (Weston 2006). This regulation \nhas had many different kinds of effects. Recent studies, for example, point to stress as a \nCuban, Before proofs, Ethnnography and Education, v3, 1, March 2008, 81-96 \n 5 \nmajor issue amongst women carers now (Weston 2006). This trend also makes training \nbig business.  \n \nTraining has most often focused on functional tasks and is competency-based (how-to-do \nit). Jackson (1991) finds that these types of trainings were meant for low-status women\u201fs \nfields and because they would not be resisted by women workers. But more than that, the \ntraining advances the employers\u201f needs, as it is, \u201eeducation on the cheap\u201f (p. 366). Basic \nskills are embedded into training courses for carers, because of their perceived lack of \nformal education and literacy skills. Yet, there is no solid evidence about these training \nbenefits for workers and ethnographic workplace training studies in the England are non-\nexistent (Ananiadiou, Jenkins, & Wolf 2004, Roberts et al 2005). Most promotions for \ntraining do not account for the barriers inherent in the workplace which cause low \nmotivation, not to mention, low attendance and absences; unpredictable schedules, no pay \nto train, high turnover, and coverage problems  (Weston 2006, Simon et al 2002) are the \nnorm. Finally, the curriculum, does not factor professional migrants\u201f expertise, their \naspirations, and movement between jobs and unfamiliar cultures, as well as their uses of \nnew media and texts.  \n \nCONTEXT OF CUMBRIA, ENGLAND: SAME LANDSCAPE NEW ECONOMY \nAlthough there is a history of internal migration to the north of England, where Cumbria \nis located, the region did not exhibit large-scale service sector needs until recently and \nthere is now demand for migrant labour from the European Union and other countries to \nwork in its new economy (Simon & Pemberton, 2006). Much of the literature focuses on \nhow migrants are regenerating these towns economically, but very little is said about the \nproblems they face. For skilled and unskilled labour groups there are few social support \nservices in rural northern towns, and they face the general problems of rural communities \n--- poor health, education services, isolation, and a downward cycle of poverty (Ellery \n2006). Little attention has focused on skilled migrants, and their movement into areas, \nsuch as Cumbria, where there is no history of mass migration settlement.   \n \nCumbria, situated between the Irish sea and the Pennine Hills is the second largest county \nin England, and covers a sizeable, sparse area that contains considerable geographic \ndiversity. Socioeconomic circumstances have changed the economy for its 500,000 \nresidents (Bennison 2007), and global capitalism has hit Cumbria hard, creating distinct \nsocial classes, and pockets of poverty next to wealth. Rural communities have been \nforced to move from agriculture (in the north and east of Cumbria), and manufacturing \n(in the west of Cumbria), after the decline of shipping to service. The southern coastal \nareas like Barrow and Worthington are undergoing drastic transitions from sea-related \nmanufacturing with large deprivation. In the northern and eastern regions of Cumbria, \nhistorically agricultural, farming has declined leaving a significant vacuum for service \nbecause like many rural areas, Cumbria has a large elderly population, one that is in ill-\nhealth and fairly isolated (Bennison 2007 Roe & Cuerdon 2004). Due to the growth of the \nservice sector, skills surveys have flagged Cumbria as lower than average, and until 2007, \nthere were no higher education institutions. Yet the County as a whole does not have high \ncrime rates and it has an older retired community who bring in income, entrepreneurs and \nfamily businesses, as well as low birth rates, strict housing development, and many \nCuban, Before proofs, Ethnnography and Education, v3, 1, March 2008, 81-96 \n 6 \npeople who are commuters from Lancashire. These issues mitigate other economic \nindicators (Roe & Cuerdon 2004). \n  \nKnown for its stark beauty\u2014the Lake District, which has been described in detail by \nrenowned authors, attracts many tourists and the elderly who want to retire making it a \nprime place for health care and hospitality. But without service workers, Cumbria\u201fs \neconomy would shrink considerably. Therefore, active recruitment of migrant women has \nhelped solve the problem, advancing these sectors even more.  In Cumbria, many Polish \npeople work in bars, restaurants, in cleaning, and in care homes, sending money home, \nand saving it for their education, and future moves. Polish newspapers, stores, and \nchurches are often used for information sharing and gathering places. Yet, reports have \nrevealed overcrowded housing, safety hazards for workers, and little access to benefits in \nthe north (Ellery, 2006). One example from this study illuminates these issues. Elsa, an \ninsurance broker from Poland and in her 20s, first visited Cumbria to see her friend who \nwas living in an overcrowded house. Elsa paid \u00a355 a week for her bed, which was on one \nside of the main room. Rather than complain, she left, only to become homeless, and was \nhelped by a Polish man she met on the street. Likewise, in other parts of Cumbria, like \nBarrow-in-Furness, there are Filipina care workers and nurses who struggle with racial \nprejudices, few established support systems, unpredictable work permit and residency \nregulations (Winkleman-Gleed 2005). Three Filipinas explained that many carers had \nfew support services to adjust. They noted that residents, at least initially, often confused \nthem with the Chinese, that there were no language schools for their children, and they \nworried about their them losing Tagalog, and speaking Taglish.  \n \nMETHODS \nThe study situates the perspectives of women who have  settled in areas where there is \nscarce documentation  about migration (Cumbria). Macro-data (from the literature \nreview)  is used to build hypotheses (or themes) about a new,  transnational phenomenon, \nhighlighting the experiences of these women (Smith 2005, Strauss & Corbin 1990, \nNaples 2004) \n \nData Collection \nFrom April 2006 to November 2006, phone and face-to-face interviews were conducted \nacross England, with care training providers, care organization staff, and literacy agency \nstaff who were involved in the care sector. During this time, contacts in Cumbria were \nobtained and I focused my research in this region since the literature showed that it had \nboth a rising ageing and migrant population, as well as care home expansion. Also, \npolicymakers in the field of care said there was little research on this phenomenon in this \nregion. Five care homes in Cumbria were identified in: Carlisle (the northern region), \nBarrow-in-Furness (western region), Kendal and Carnforth (southern region) and \nWindermere and Ambleside (central region). The care homes were of different sizes and \ntypes (residential, nursing, sheltered, domiciliary), and were purposively sampled. \nAdditional data was collected on nine migrant women carers from January to March \n2007, through weekly and bi-monthly visits to their workplaces and training sites. The \nvisits familiarized me with all of the participants, including carers (both migrant and \nBritish-born), clients, trainers, and employers. Finally, one carer became an informant to \nCuban, Before proofs, Ethnnography and Education, v3, 1, March 2008, 81-96 \n 7 \nme, enabling me to ask her additional questions that other carers only hinted at in their \ninterviews.  \n \nThe Carers \nThe women were sampled firstly because they were women, migrants and carers. After \nlearning that most of these carers were highly skilled, I continued to sample based on  \nprofessional qualifications and education levels and to get an ethnic balance. The major \nsource of data comes from interviews, which I conducted with thirty professional migrant \nwomen from November 2006-June 2007. Each woman was interviewed for an hour or \nmore, focusing on her reasons for migrating, the steps she took to migrate, her work \nhistory, and about her educational qualifications. I also asked her about the networks she \nformed, the supports she exchanged, her use of community resources, and lastly, about \nher experiences of living and working as carers in Cumbria, as well as her aspirations.  \n \nThe women came from working-class and middle-class backgrounds in Romania, \nThailand, India, the Philippines and Poland, with the last three countries most \nrepresented. Most of the carers were within a year to two years of arriving in England and \nwere in their first jobs. Those who had spent more than a year in England often had other \njobs before they arrived to their company, and it was usually in hotels, restaurants, or \nfactories, or they had recently graduated from university. The women ranged in age from \ntheir 20s to their 50s. Most of the Polish women were single without children while \nIndian women tended to be either engaged or married, with a few having children. \nAlmost all of the Filipinas were married, with husbands who also worked abroad, and \nmost of them had children, who were being taken care of by their parents. A few spouses \njoined the women, but most families did not come over to England to live. However, \nmany of the women\u201fs relatives, especially the Filipinas\u201f lived in other countries and a \ncouple of the carers\u201f mothers from Poland, also worked abroad as carers. \n \nMany of the women came from small cities and towns, and a large proportion of them \nwere recruited by agencies through the internet, newspapers, and flyers, and some of \nthem had friends who referred them to the agencies or directly recruited them. While a \nfew of the Filipinas had worked abroad (in Israel or in Saudia Arabia), most of the \nwomen had not, and, saw England as their first transnational stop, in their moves across \nthe world. Many women, especially registered nurses, aimed to go to the U.S. to work \nbecause they heard there were more jobs there or they had family members who lived \nthere.  Australia was another destination. All of the women, except one, had graduated \nfrom university and all of them could be considered professionals in their countries \n(nurses, insurance brokers, teachers, physical therapists). Yet their educational \nqualifications were not recognized in England\n2\n.  \n \n                                                 \n2\n One of the nurses, when she first came over to England, was told by her employer that \nshe was in \u2018training\u2019 to be a nurse, but she did not receive a nurse\u2019s salary, and it was \nunclear  to bother her and myself whether or not she was working as a nurse or carer, \nduring this period. Another woman carer eventually got a job as a nurse outside of \nCumbria during the period of the study.  \nCuban, Before proofs, Ethnnography and Education, v3, 1, March 2008, 81-96 \n 8 \nAlmost all of the women worked over 40 hours a week at their jobs, and only a few \nworked at their set contract hours, with many working around 60 hours a week and some \nclose to 70. It was not uncommon for carers, especially senior carers, to work nearly 100 \nhours over a ten-day period, and 10-12 hour shifts. They often asked for more hours due \nto the fact that few care homes paid overtime for working nightshifts and pay hovered \naround \u00a36\/hour.  Working these hours, they could afford to pay for basic necessities and \nsend money home. Their costs of living were high in comparison to their wages. All of \nthem lived in apartments and houses and paid an average of \u00a3240 a month for a bed in a \nroom with 2 people, in addition to many other amenities, which were not included in their \nrents. Most of the women were in debt in some way, either to their families for agency \nand moving fees, and\/or to their employers (for car loans). These debts appeared to keep \nthem tied to their jobs, all of which were contracted (yearly and then every 2 or 5 years). \nFor the women with families, it was expected that they send money to them, and after \ntheir debts were paid locally, all mothers, sent most of their monthly income. The money \nwas used for health, school, and basic necessities, which had recently risen (probably due \nto SAP). \n \nEmployers \nI got to know three of the five employers fairly well, with one becoming an informant. \nFive of the employers were each given interviews, with three participating in follow-up \ninterviews and focus groups. All of them were care home managers, British-born, mostly \nformer nurses, and all, except one were women. The employers discussed the stresses of \ntheir jobs (especially increasing amounts of auditing and regulations), the need for \nconstant training of their employees to meet changing regulatory rules, and the \nadvantages and disadvantages of employing migrants. Advantages were mainly that they \nfilled an important need as they had high vacancy rates and were frequently short-staffed. \nOther advantages were that migrants could recruit for them, which allowed them to hire \nmore staff. The employers felt that these carers were able to work long hours, and were \nhard workers, the clients liked them, they were easy to train, and agreeable to working \nwith their British-born colleagues. Disadvantages were problems around \nmiscommunication due to speaking a second language, accents between elderly \nCumbrians and the carers, and cultural expressions, and idioms were sometimes sources \nof confusion. Employers felt that some migrant staff  misunderstood instructions that they \nwere initially given, but that these could be explained and rectified. Most employers saw \nthese communication problems as resolvable. But other problems were more complex \nand out of their immediate control, such as the housing market, transportation, and cost of \npetrol. These factors disabled the carers from being settled and getting their basic needs \nmet, and put employers in delicate positions. Two employers discussed how some ethnic \ngroups \u201estick together\u201f which they saw as problematic. All of the employers were \nsympathetic with the fact that a number of the carers were qualified nurses, and two \nemployers gave them opportunities and time off to take adaptation courses.  One \nemployer paid for two staff members to take English courses at a Further Education (FE) \ncollege while another one rotated nurses, albeit haphazardly, through adaptation courses. \nIt was clear that the employers had many factors to balance in hiring migrant staff, and \nmost seemed to take the responsibility seriously. Still, it was clear that their allegiances \nwere with the owners of the companies, and their bottom-line agenda to make profits.  \nCuban, Before proofs, Ethnnography and Education, v3, 1, March 2008, 81-96 \n 9 \n \nLimitations of the Study \nThere were several limitations. Firstly, my initial entry was through the employers, rather \nthan through the women\u201fs networks, which initially impacted the ways the migrant carers \nperceived me. To reduce the perception that I was allied with the employers, and would \nreveal information to them, I introduced sensitive subjects in a natural way, like speaking \nabout my own experiences at work as a \u201emigrant\u201f in England and they were doubly \nreassured that everything they revealed to me would be confidential and that their \nidentities would be disguised in reports, articles, and presentations. Secondly, the \ninterview period was less than a year, and the women were newly arrived. Therefore, I, \nthereby limiting the scope and depth of the study did, not see changes, as well as other \nparts of their lives. Thirdly, it was a convenient sample. Lastly, all but one, of the \ninterviews were taped, but due to time and resources, only 16 were transcribed. These \ntranscriptions, however, represented many of the issues of the thirty women.  \n \nAnalysis \nA short case study of each woman was made, using the interview data, transcripts, and \nfield notes about the workplace, the employer\u201fs perceptions and observations. Then, a \ngrid of the women\u201fs socio-demographic traits and their literacy\/language\/education \nexperiences was developed.  This matrix allowed me to compare the women\u201fs issues, and \nestablish a wide-ranging list of general codes that represented the phenomenon. Using \nthese codes, I carefully read through all of the case studies again to confirm them, and \ncondensed them into a shorter list. I also searched for key metaphors, phrases, images, \nand statements they made, as well as silences and pauses about sensitive issues. A \nresearch assistant and I used this information to create a list of multifaceted codes. The \ntranscripts were coded by the assistant through AtlasTi, and I also coded some of the \ntranscripts separately for reliability purposes. Anecdotes compiled within each code were \nexamined for patterns and to generate a list of general categories. These categories were \nthen cross-compared to check their validity across other case studies, and to generate \nthemes about the roles of education, learning, and literacy in the networks and mobility \npatterns of the women. The themes are presented below. \n \nTHEMES \nAs the migrant women moved to and between their new homes, communities, and \nworkplaces, they engaged episodically in education, used literacies to negotiate \nworkplace cultures, and they formed innovative networks to help them adjust. But they \nhad little upward mobility or opportunities to advance. There were many forces creating \nthese circumstances. These themes are:  1) Balancing the 4\nth\n shift of paperwork and \nperson-centred care, 2) survivor circuits of the north, and 3) The myth of English and \neducation escalators for career advancement \n \n1) The 4th shift- Professional migrant women can balance the paperwork with \nperson-centered approaches to modernized care.  \n \nThe amount of paperwork and time to complete it in the modernized care setting was \ndubbed,  \u201cthe fourth shift, \u201d because it was extra work that was not accounted for on the \nCuban, Before proofs, Ethnnography and Education, v3, 1, March 2008, 81-96 \n 10 \njob and it reinforced their subjugation. This metaphor builds on the work of Hochschild \n(2002) who refers to the 2\nnd\n shift, where women work for pay during the day and then \ncome home only to do unpaid work--cleaning, caring and emotional labour. The third \nshift (Bolton, 2000) represents women having to manage increasing educational and \ncareer demands, in order to advance. Following from these ideas, my research and the \nliterature indicate that mature British-born carers were leaving  the care sector due to the \nstress of managing education (3\nrd\n shift) and paperwork (4\nth\n shift) (Rainbird, Senker, & \nEvans 2003, Brown & Kirpal 2003). Once they leave, vacancies open up to migrants who \nhave little choice but to comply with these demands. With their higher levels of formal \neducation, transferable generic skills, (LSC 2006, Green, Owen, & Wilson 2006) and \nparticipation in skilled migration chains, these carers are more likely than the British-\nborn carers (who came to care because it did not require this work) to pass national \nliteracy tests and NVQ exams with little or no training and recruit family and friends who \ndo the same (Johnston et al. 2006, Sassen 1998). Recruiting these workers, then, is an \neconomical strategy for employers because they do not have to provide training, which \nhas rarely been available to British-born carers, anyway, and, they could secure a non-\nthreatening workforce who could work overtime, under pressured conditions, without \nquestioning British labour laws and their rights as workers. \n \nThe employers in the study did not necessarily recruit professional migrant care workers \nbecause of their expertise with paperwork, but because they were a cost-efficient solution \nto staff shortages. However, when considering training, they viewed migrant workers\u201f  \nadvanced English skill levels and previous education and training as a value-added \nincentive, since they were under pressure to have staff achieve quotas for the state \nmandated NVQs. It was clear from the interviews that the carers\u201f professional expertise \nand skills enabled them to handle new and routine paperwork and they understood the \ntechniques of technical writing. This was important since it was clear that there was a \npaperwork explosion with many duties needing to be recorded in logs (dietary charts, \ntoilet charts, log sheets), plus, more training, auditing, and the invasion of new tests. \nThese carers knew they could write in a form of shorthand and found writing in the \nrequisite forms to be easy busywork, even noting that their British colleagues found this \ntask difficult, as they often requested spelling assistance from them, and were amused at \ntheir inappropriate note-taking. While the paperwork was easy for them to deal with, it \ncreated extra work for them and bound them to a type of care that was labour-intensive \nbecause of its task specificity. \n \nAt the same time, the carers also understood the importance of person-centred care and \nthe interpersonal skills that were needed to make clients feel comfortable. So, they sought \nto improve their knowledge of Cumbrian humour, of, chatting, being polite in a way \nBritish elders would appreciate, and smiled continuously so as to provide succor, when \nwords weren\u201ft possible. Much of the communication they had with clients read like a \nscript, with the same subjects repeated daily, as if it were a ritual (\u201ethe weather is bad\u201f). \nOne carer explained the importance of easing the client through body language and she \nsmiled continuously despite the fact that she said she was, \u201ecrying inside\u201f (because she \nmissed her children in the Philippines). Not only did these carers hold this knowledge and \nskills, but also they used them even when they were not solicited. One client knew the \nCuban, Before proofs, Ethnnography and Education, v3, 1, March 2008, 81-96 \n 11 \n\u201eforeign\u201f staff had professional expertise, which reassured her she was getting a good \ndeal.  The carers also felt that their professional training and qualifications impacted their \nability to offer excellent care to the clients, even when their supervisors, doctors, and \nnurses did not recognize it.  \n \nAs part of being viewed as a competent professional, and because they felt they were \noutsiders and needed to be compliant with regulations, they rarely complained about their \nsituations, even when they were intolerable. They did not seek out unions or any kind of \nformal advocacy.  A couple of the women experienced gender and racial discrimination \non the job, with clients yelling racial epithets, offensive names or treating them like \nslaves; one client actually called the carers \u201eslaves\u201f while another one told her carers to \n\u201efuck off\u201f when they walked in the door and greeted her. Many of the carers would either \nreport these difficulties and hope the management would rectify it, or they went out of \ntheir way to not inform the employers of their hardships even when it was the employers\u201f \nresponsibility to remedy the situation. They felt they had to resolve the problem alone \nand withstand it by being understanding about their clients\u201f condition.  This unspoken \nindividualistic expectation was upheld in the management discourse of professionalism. \nObservations of trainings and analysis of training manuals focused heavily on carers \nhandling their own problems, and at best, recording complaints. Abuse workshops and \ncurriculum, for example, focused on how carers should not abuse patients, and if clients \nabused them, it could be managed. Yet little was done for the carers when patients, \nespecially those who were considered to be mentally ill, hit them or verbally harassed \nthem. A number of them felt terrible and hopeless after these incidents. In addition, since \nmany of the women had experienced gender and racial discrimination in previous jobs \nwhere there were no protections either, they were not used to lodging complaints,  \nprotesting their conditions, or seeing anything positive transpire from official grievances. \n \nThe paperwork that women really needed help with (but got little of ) was the ubiquitous \nadministrative and legal paperwork from recruitment agencies during the pre-migration \nstage. Often the women did not know what fees they paid for, and the agency was rarely \nclear about the costs, even when they were exorbitant (\u00a33000 for example). They also \ngave few timelines for when their paperwork would be finished, and in numerous cases, \ncash was asked for and no receipts were given, with demands to \u201etrust us.\u201f Agencies \nwould often blame another organization for delays, informing applicants that their case \nwas legally difficult, using this to incur more fees. Agencies typically gave the women \nvery little, except a foot in the door, a promise of a professional position once they \nfinished their contracts as carers, and an initial employer contact. This seemed to be \nenough to convince family members to loan them money. The agency would hire several \ncarers at once, identify care homes to send them to, and arrange for someone to meet \nthem and house them for a few days before they went to their requisite homes. One \nwoman, upon reaching England, was abandoned by her agency, and homeless. She \nreceived help by consulting a family friend in London. Most of the women felt that the \nagencies had overcharged them, and it appeared that a couple of them were under \ninvestigation.  \n \nCuban, Before proofs, Ethnnography and Education, v3, 1, March 2008, 81-96 \n 12 \n2) The women created survival circuits to help them acculturate, learn, and exchange \ninformation that was linked to global supply and demand for care. \n \nThe \u201esurvival circuits\u201f of migrants (Sassen, 1998) serve many functions, and are not \ncomposed of their personal networks strictly for adjustment to a new culture. They are \nindicative of what is referred to in the literature as, \u201eglobal care chains\u201f (Parrenas 2002). \nThis concept, although not solidly defined, refers to the ways that women, often from \ndeveloping countries, get drawn into paid and unpaid care work in industrialized \ncountries, of caring for children or the elderly, through each other, as well as through care \nsponsors (like recruiters), and the ways their networks form around their care, including \nsupporting carers for their own children abroad; some women for example, in this study, \nrecruited one another through word-of-mouth, supplying the agencies with credentials, \nand employers with employees, and a number of them had carers for their own children \nabroad. These survivor circuits could also become channels for exchanging information \nabout education, housing, and jobs, as this study showed, although it wasn\u201ft enough to \nmove ahead. Although most of the research on women migrants has focused on their \nsurvival circuits in global cities, this study indicates that these networks were active in \nrural areas too, as well as between rural and urban areas (for example, the recruitment \nagencies were located in cities, where the women originally landed, and they also phoned \nfamily contacts in London or Manchester). Rarely, however did carers make visits, \nleaving them to depend on one another for various forms of support. Making new friends, \nwas difficult as most of the women were extremely busy, couldn\u201ft use their mobiles \nduring work, and hurried from one task or home to the next. While they preferred to be \nbusy, they often felt rushed and tired from running around. In addition, they were often \npressured to work overtime, and to be on call for their companies when they needed \nthem, in addition to dealing with constant changes with clients\u201f care plans that \ndiminished their own sense of control over their lives and sense of well-being. One \nwoman said: \u201eI don\u201ft like this flexible work\u2026 I prefer start work and finish work and \nthen have time for myself.\u201f \n \nFor those carers who were nurses, this pressure was felt as normal, as most of them were \nused to working long hours in their previous jobs. But for other women, the hours were \ntiring and isolating. Since the people they spent the most amount of time with were \nclients, a number (although not all) of the carers resolved to relate well to the ones they \nliked most and even learn something from them (like, practicing their English, or learning \nabout British history). They often projected familial attributes onto these clients, speaking \nof them as \u201egrandparents\u201f and \u201efriends\u201f and doing extra favours for them. These carers \nidentified with these elderly clients that they cared for (almost all of them women), as not \nonly marginalized in society, but also by their families who seemed too \u201ebusy\u201f to help \nthem, and the carers often struggled to understand why these families didn\u201ft take care of \nthem, as they would take care of their own parents if they could. The carers engaged in \nmuch emotional labour with the clients, and they were observed hugging and holding \nthem when they were upset, apart from just dressing them, and they might listen to them \nfor longer periods of time than their care plans specified. While the carers disclosed basic \npersonal information to clients, company guidelines forbid them to reveal anything more \nabout themselves so that the relationship remained \u201eprofessional.\u201f Nonetheless, some of \nCuban, Before proofs, Ethnnography and Education, v3, 1, March 2008, 81-96 \n 13 \nthe carers felt attached to these older women and the intimacy that evolved from their \ninteractions with one another. Also, nurturing care relationships takes much time and \ninvestment for it to work, on the parts of carers (Parrenas 2002), which is not counted or \nfactored by employers whose focus is on the completion of care tasks. \n \nThe carers had little time for self-care activities; with one or two days off a week, they \noften slept in due to being tired from long on-call days. Yet they often called their \nfamilies, sometimes every day (if they had children) to give emotional support and to \nconnect with them. In these instances, the carers only revealed so much because they did \nnot want to worry their families. When the carers had problems, they often turned to \nother carers in their company, rather than to employers or to their families abroad. One \nwoman\u201fs car broke down and instead of contacting the employer, she phoned up her \ncredit card company (in another country) and borrowed money. Then, she turned to her a \ncolleague, and her visiting parents, who helped her to move the car. She then bought an \nolder car from a client. A number of the carers, in wanting to acculturate, sought out \ninformation, when they could, about community resources, and attempted to mix with \nBritish-born residents as much as possible. Two sisters, for example, got involved with \nthe local church. Another woman took her books to the local library and contributed to a \nPolish collection. Other carers shared houses with British residents and learnt about \nBritish culture from them. From their British-born colleagues, they learnt about tax \nissues. These contacts became part of their care networks and helped them to survive as \nnew migrants.  \n \n3) The myth of English and vocational escalators for career advancement \n \nMany carers were public sector workers before they arrived to England and experienced \ndiscrimination, not to mention being underemployed and not paid well. Subsequently \nthey viewed these care positions, which paid them three to five times more money as \ncontributing to their own, and their families\u201f, financial well-being,  making economic \nincentives a primary motive for their migration. Yet, only a few carers identified these \njobs as a \u201ecareer move\u201f like the recruitment agencies had promoted them. The agencies \nappeared to specifically search for women who were ambitious, enthusiastic, and fit the \nbill. Those with advanced English language proficiencies were sought after, and they \nwere given tests in English to document their levels for employers. The prospective \ncarers were also interviewed by phone or in person in English to test their oral\/aural \nskills. The concern, according to the employers, was the carers\u201f abilities to be understood \nand follow instructions around the clients\u201f needs. Yet, employers would often confuse \nproficiencies with accents, and this could lead to problems for some carers. Once they \nwere hired, they were rarely fired because of their non-standard English accents. Instead, \nthey were moved to other areas of a company where they would have less contact with \nclients, or they were not given additional responsibilities. This finding concurs with \nNorton\u201fs study (2000) of immigrant women in a Canadian workplace who were given \njobs that would not require English or contact with Canadian citizens. Without practice, \nthey became further marginalized, and lost confidence to speak. Power and position, \nrather than abilities, shaped their opportunities to advance. With their difficult hours, it \nCuban, Before proofs, Ethnnography and Education, v3, 1, March 2008, 81-96 \n 14 \nwas hard for carers to find advanced level English classes they could attend, and many \ncouldn\u201ft try them, or dropped out. \n \nIn the Philippines, agencies often demanded educational qualifications of a certain caliber \n(tertiary education, nursing degrees and certificates) even though they were headed into \ncaring jobs. Yet when they arrived, carers realized how far behind they were in terms of \ngetting UK qualifications. Some of the carers adopted the policy discourse, and felt that \ntheir main barrier to advancing was to increase their English language skills even when \nthey had used it in college. The carers also desired to increase whatever skills or \nqualifications they thought they needed. They sought information about tests, bought \nthem from bookstores, borrowed them from friends and the library, studied for them, and \neasily passed their NVQs, even without knowing their value on the education market. \nMuch of the studying was self-taught and through books and computers and these were \nimportant learning strategies.  Nurses had many barriers for advancing their careers, \nincluding, needing high scores on language tests in order to start the adaptation process, \nassociation fees, the high costs of adaptation courses, and changing regulations and \nstandards, and the knowledge that hospitals and care homes were not applying for work \npermits.  \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe women carers adapted to care industry demands through learning the hidden \ncurriculum of the \u201enew work order\u201f care force (as with the 4th shift), and by forming \u201ejust-\nin-time\u201f care networks (Louie 2001). These were critical supports, although not \nunproblematic adaptation mechanisms, because they involved great sacrifices and did not \nlead to career advancement. Although the carers were physically mobile, they \nexperienced little upward mobility; the nurses in particular seemed to be deskilled, and \nentrapped. Other carers tried to re-skill so as to advance, only to experience barriers, \nincluding their initial entry into the care home (with debts, a contract they were afraid to \nbreak, and a managerial discourse of professionalism which didn\u201ft allow them freedom of \nexpression). Additionally, the work organization (long on-call hours and low pay), \nprevented them from acquiring education that could genuinely move them forward. The \nNVQs held little value in the labour market compared to adaptation courses or higher \neducation. In addition, there were few support services in Cumbria that reached out to the \ncarers when they were discriminated against, or needed help, or counseling about \nnegotiating new transnational identities\u2014all of the mothers, for example, struggled with \nbeing faraway breadwinners and emotional comforters to their families. These women \nwere indeed, a hidden, silenced group. Yet,  they were central actors in the liberalisation \nand professionalisation of the care sector, smoothing the transition to privatised welfare. \nThey allowed the elderly to become independent confidently, they reassured their \nfamilies that their parents\u201f treatment would be professional, they supplied a growing \naudit culture, they reduced costs for employers because they could use their networks to \nrecruit, and needed little training, and they could be paid cut-rate salaries. Lastly, \nalthough unrecognized, these women were altering stagnant communities with their \ncultural diversity, economic drive, perceptive ingenuity, and educational and literacy \ncapital.  \n \nCuban, Before proofs, Ethnnography and Education, v3, 1, March 2008, 81-96 \n 15 \nREFERENCES \nAckers, H.L.
