Cross and Ellen E. Strachan\nAbstract\u2014The problem of tracking small changes in the\noutput wavelength of laser diodes is addressed using a dual slab\nwaveguide interferometer fabricated from silicon oxynitride.\nWaveguide mode dispersion differences between the waveguide\nmodes provide a mechanism for identifying input wavelength\nshifts that are measured as shifts in the output far-field diffraction\nimage. At visible wavelengths the device can transduce input\nwavelength changes into phase responses with a sensitivity of+0.9\nrad\/nm. The lower threshold limit of detection for laser output\nfrequency shifts, is 2.2 GHz or 6 pm at a center wavelength of 635\nnm. The TE and TM sensitivities to wavelength are approximately\nequivalent in the device described.\nIndex Terms\u2014Dispersion, interferometer, optical waveguides,\nwavelength lockers.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nDEVICES that can track and stabilize the output wavelengthof semiconductor diode lasers are increasingly important\nas channel count increases in the ITU grid. This task is most\ncommonly served by a discrete microoptical component such as\na Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot thin-film filter which acts via photodiodes to pro-\nvide an error signal to a feedback loop that controls the output\nfrequency of the laser [1], [2]. Alternative methods have been\nproposed that would allow, in principle, monolithic integration\nof a control element with wavelength transparent operation [3].\nThe latter becomes important with the advent of widely tunable\nlaser sources that will enter the marketplace in the next few years\n[4].\nInterferometric detection of wavelength shifts can be an\nextremely sensitive method, but it has not been explored\nsignificantly in the context of diode laser wavelength shifts.\nThe present work describes such a method that also offers the\nprospect of monolithic integration and wavelength transparent\noperation.\nA. Dual Slab Waveguide Interferometer\nWe have developed a dual slab waveguide interferometer that\nprovides an output diffraction pattern whose intensity distribu-\ntion is sensitive to the input wavelength.\nThe simple fabrication of the interferometer comprises a\n5-layer dielectric stack on a semiconductor wafer surface\n(Fig. 1).\nManuscript received January 25, 2002; revised March 7, 2002.\nThe authors are with the University of Durham, Department of Physics,\nDurham, DH1 3LE U.K. (e-mail: g.h.cross@durham.ac.uk).\nPublisher Item Identifier S 1041-1135(02)04804-8.\nFig. 1. Dual slab waveguide interferometer. Alternate layers of high (clear)\nand low (shaded) refractive indexes comprise an interferometer with two\nseparate waveguide paths. A waveguide mode dispersion difference exists\nbetween the upper and lower guides when the structure is made structurally or\ncompositionally asymmetric (see text and Table I.\nFig. 2. The interferometer far-field intensity distribution using light at 632.8\nnm on a 128-pixel linear photodiode array.\nCurrent devices are fabricated on silicon with silicon oxyni-\ntride dielectric layers deposited by PECVD. Since the second\nand fourth layers are of higher refractive index than their adja-\ncent layers these form optical waveguiding paths, in a dual slab\nwaveguide structure. On introducing an optical field to the en-\ntrance plane of the device, the upper and lower modes are ex-\ncited with equal efficiency and propagate through the structure.\nAt the output plane, the two modes are allowed to diffract into\nthe far field where they form the well-known pattern reminiscent\nof Young\u2019s interference fringes on an array photodiode (Fig. 2).\nThe spatial intensity distribution of the interference pattern is\nrepresentative of the relative phase position of the output fields\nof the upper and lower modes at the output plane of the device.\nShould this change, the spatial intensity distribution changes,\nthus providing the transduction method.\n1041-1135\/02$17.00 \u00a9 2002 IEEE\nIE\nEE\nPr\noo\nf\n2 IEEE PHOTONICS TECHNOLOGY LETTER\nTABLE I\nLAYER STRUCTURE AND OPTOGEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF THE\nINTERFEROMETER.\nB. Operating Principles\nThe guide layer thickness and composition differences gives\nrise to differences in waveguide mode dispersion between the\ntwo guides. Thus, as wavelength changes, the phase retardation\nproduced in the upper ( ) and lower ( ) modal fields dif-\nfers. The net effect is a phase change difference, , observed\nbetween upper and lower waveguide modes according to the fol-\nlowing\n(1)\nwhere is the interferometer length and represents the\ndifference in propagation constant in each mode (upper and\nlower) due to a wavelength change to and given by\n(2)\nwhere is the wavenumber, and is the mode effective\nindex in the upper or lower mode, at the two wavelengths and\n. Note that the interferometer returns the sign of , as well as\nits magnitude thus directly distinguishing between wavelength\nincreases or decreases.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe interferometer layer structure is fabricated according to\nthe nominal design parameters given in Table I. Devices are\ncleaved from the 100 mm diameter wafer which is supplied pre-\nsawn into strips 5.8 mm in width and normal to the 100 crystal\nplane.\nThe interferometer chip is clamped within a dual stage tem-\nperature-controlled housing. Temperature control to better than\n10 mK is readily achievable in this housing. The input light\nis provided by a visible laser diode (Coherent VLM2.3\u20135L, 5\nmW, 635 nm) and directed onto the chip end face using a low\npower microscope eyepiece lens ( 1 ). The laser is held in its\nown temperature-controlled housing (single stage). The focused\nlaser beam size is large compared with the vertical separation\nof the waveguides (4 m), so that light incident upon the device\nend facet excites the two modes of the structure with approxi-\nmately equal efficiency. The output light falls on a 128 element\nlinear photodiode array (Texas Instruments, TSL1401) and the\npixel voltages are recorded as the amplitudes of the assigned\nspatial phase position of each pixel in the spatial period given\nby the fringe image. A discrete Fourier transform updates the\nFig. 3. Sensitivity to wavelength change in TM polarization of an\ninterferometer chip of length L = 24 mm.\nphase position of the pattern every 50 ms and provides a rel-\native phase value. 20 point averaging was used to give a data\npoint every second.\nA reference beam is tapped from the beam path and the\noutput power and wavelength position is then independently\nmonitored using an Ocean Optics fiber-optic spectrometer\n(1200 line grating blazed at 750 nm, 10- m slits). The wave-\nlength resolution full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the\nspectrometer is to within 0.45 nm. Wavelength measurement\nwas possible to a precision of 0.15 nm, however since the CCD\narray detector provides 3 pixels within this range. A calibration\ncheck was performed using a helium neon laser source (632.8\nnm) and a miniature diode-pumped frequency doubled Nd\u2013Yag\nlaser (532.0 nm).\nTemperature control of the laser over a temperature range 17\nC\u201324 C and wavelength measurement using the spectrometer\nfound a thermooptic coefficient of 0.2 nm\/K.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe sensitivity to a wavelength change over 2 nm in a chip\nof length 24 mm and in transverse magnetic (TM) excitation is\nshown in Fig. 3. The solid line represents a linear fit to the data\nwith a slope of 0.863 rad\/nm.\nPrecise phase measurements taken at thermal equilibrium at\ntwo temperatures (23.67 C and 20.33 C) provided a value\nof the thermooptic coefficient of 0.017 rad\/K. Given the mea-\nsured laser thermooptic characteristics (0.2 nm\/K) and the in-\nterferometer wavelength sensitivity (0.86 rad\/nm), we would\ndiscriminate the thermal effects on the interferometer from the\nwavelength shifts that the thermal effect would produce in the\nlaser by a factor of 10. Thus, an attractive feature of this design\nis the large discrimination between thermal and wavelength dis-\npersive effects.\nDispersion measurements made in Transverse Electric (TE)\npolarization on a chip of length 25 mm yield a sensitivity of 0.94\nrad\/nm. The sensitivity per millimeter of interferometer length\n(0.0375 rad\/nm mm) is almost equal to that for TM polarization\n(0.0358 rad\/nm mm).\nA. Theoretical Analysis\nThe predicted eigenvalues (propagation constants) for the\nupper and lower waveguide modes and their dispersion have\nIE\nEE\nPr\noo\nf\nCROSS AND STRACHAN: DIODE LASER WAVELENGTH TRACKING 3\nTABLE II\nLAYER STRUCTURE OF A TYPICAL DOUBLE HETEROJUNCTION LASER\nDIODE EMITTING AT 1.55 \u0016m. \u201cQ\u201d REPRESENTS THE QUATERNARY\nCOMPOUND SEMICONDUCCTOR, InGaAsP\nbeen obtained. From these we obtain the following expected\nvalues for for modes in the wavelength range of interest\n(635\u2013637 nm):\nrad\/nm mm\nrad\/nm mm\nCompared to the measured values ( 0.0358 rad\/nm mm for TM\nand 0.0375 rad\/nm mm for TE) the calculated values are a\nfactor of around four lower, yet in approximately the same ratio.\nFurthermore, the sign of the expected response (positive phase\nshift) agrees with experiment. The discrepancy will be domi-\nnated by inaccuracies in the reported thickness and index values\nlimited by the ellipsometric determination. The dispersion dif-\nference is extremely sensitive to these parameters. If we as-\nsume that the lower guide is at its upper thickness and index\nlimits and the upper guide is at its lower limits, a calculation re-\nveals a value for of 0.0716 rad\/nm mm. Thus, the exper-\nimental value ( rad\/nm mm) falls somewhere\nwithin these limits.\nAs a further indication of projected performance, we have cal-\nculated the dispersive properties of an interferometer fabricated\nusing a typical material recipe for double heterojunction buried\nridge waveguide lasers. The structural and optical properties are\ngiven in Table II. The substrate is assumed to be an InP wafer.\nCalculation of the normal modes of this structure at the wave-\nlength boundaries of the \u201cC\u201d band (1525 and 1562 nm) and\nusing equations (1) and (2) gave the following average wave-\nlength dispersion sensitivities\nrad\/nm mm.\nrad\/nm mm.\nThus, for a 5 mm device length, and with a noise floor of 1\nmrad, the wavelength noise floor limit for TE polarized light\nwould be 1 pm.\nWhile in practice, there will be some restrictions on the op-\ntogeometrical parameters of the layers that could be used, some\noptimization is nevertheless possible. If one were to follow\nthe prescriptions given by Veldhuis et al. [5] and by Pandraud\nand Parriaux [6], the two waveguides could be engineered\nto provide maximum and minimum geometric dispersion,\nrespectively. Such performance enhancement would lessen the\nimpact in practice of manufacturing variability on the value of\n.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nA dual slab waveguide interferometer has been fabricated and\nexamined for its wavelength dispersive characteristics. In a tem-\nperature regulated environment, phase shift responses are mea-\nsurable above a noise floor of less than 2 mrad, corresponding\nto a wavelength noise floor of 2.3 pm in TM polarization and\n2.13 pm in TE polarization at center wavelengths around 636\nnm. A high sensitivity of the dispersion difference to small vari-\nations in waveguide composition is suggested to explain a dis-\nagreement between experimental results and theoretical predic-\ntions. Nevertheless, theoretical predictions confirm the relative\nordering of TM to TE sensitivity and the absolute sign of the\nobserved responses. In the design examined, the thermal sen-\nsitivity of the structure has the same sign as the wavelength\nsensitivity, but is one order of magnitude smaller. Projections\nto structures consisting of high refractive index layers such as\nthose found in the compound semiconductors suggests that in-\nterferometers with picometer level wavelength tracking should\nbe possible. Integrating the device with the laser monolithically\nwould bring advantages in reduced noise, and higher efficiency\nof excitation of the waveguide modes.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank the National Microelec-\ntronics Research Center (NMRC) for sample devices.
