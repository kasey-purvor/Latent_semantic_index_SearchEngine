It\ntakes the child outside the time continuum of ordinary, everyday life and locates them\nin hospital. Until they are well enough to leave, they cannot rejoin a normal living\nrelationship to the world and until they do that, they cannot really be said to be in step\nwith time along with their peers. In this sense, being in hospital takes them out of\nordinary time.\nThe young people are admitted with various different problems. What seems to be\nthe same for all of them, however, is that their stay involves them, to some extent, in\nnegotiating the timing of their own developmental process as it is interrupted by their\nillness and hospital admission.\nJoanne, for example, suffering from conversion disorder, was 13 when she arrived on\nthe Unit \u2013 very sleepy, unresponsive and wheelchair bound \u2013 and she looked about 10\nor 11. At first, she wanted to leave as quickly as possible but then kept changing her\nmind, and when her discharge date came she said it was too soon and the date was\nchanged. When Joanne finally did leave, she looked much more like the teenager she\nwas, and she had also managed to negotiate a further three months of individual\npsychotherapy post-discharge. Other patients, like Simon, who was 12, had a\nconversion disorder and arrived at the Unit in a fixed prone position and being tube fed.\nFor a long time he took a pride in being the illest patient on the Unit who had been in\nhospital for the longest time. There always seems to a certain amount of competition for\nthis particular position amongst some of the patients. Simon did not like to hear\nanything about discharge or any possibility of making progress.\nThe Unit\nThe Unit is a Tier 4 NHS children\u2019s psychiatric inpatient unit for 7\u201314-year-olds. It\ntakes referrals from around the country as well as those from the local Tier 4 Specialist\nCAMHS team of which it is a part. It is a nine-bed unit and costs the referrer\napproximately \u00a32200 per week, per child.\nThe treatment programme and the multi-disciplinary team\nThe treatment programme, delivered by the multi-disciplinary team, is intensive.\nWithin a framework of psycho-social nursing, each child is allocated two \u2018key\nworkers\u2019. The Nurses and Therapeutic Care Workers also run various therapeutic\ngroups and community meetings, with the aim of giving the young people\nopportunities for working with peers. All the children go to the small school on the\nUnit and, in time, progress to the larger hospital school. The children and their\nfamilies all attend regular family and individual work. The relationship between the\ndifferent aspects of treatment in an inpatient setting is interwoven and there is a\nstrong emphasis on combined efforts working together, where one area of work in the\nmulti-disciplinary team is felt to be no more or less responsible for treatment outcome\nthan another.\n326 S. GUSTAVUS JONES\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:4\n4 \n18\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nLiaison with local services\nRegular six-weekly Review Meetings are held for each child. At the beginning of an\nadmission, the Review Meeting is the place where the family sees the inpatient team and\noutpatient professionals all together discussing their child. The ongoing involvement\nwith local CAMHS throughout an admission \u2013 their support and interest in the family\nand child \u2013 feels crucial, and the Review Meeting becomes the focus of contact. As the\nReview Meetings are repeated \u2013 and discharge becomes more of an issue \u2013 the\natmosphere of meetings can shift and there seems to be a perpetual question hanging in\nthe air: Who now \u2018holds\u2019 this child and family emotionally? An ongoing negotiation\nbetween inpatient team, family and outpatient services around this question is played\nout in the Review Meeting and the issue of time is gradually drawn into sharper focus.\nThe question goes much deeper than medical and clinical responsibility. The child and\nfamily will eventually need a discharge date, but they cannot be discharged into nothing.\nOn a very basic level, it would not feel helpful for the timing of discharge to coincide\nwith the beginning of an unstructured school holiday and when CAMHS support is\nmainly unavailable due to annual leave. On a deeper level, the child and family need to\nfeel supported and held in the mind of their local team.\nIf staying on the Unit is seen as a kind of \u2018time out\u2019 from life, leaving the Unit could\nbe seen as re-engaging with time as part of a continuation of the developmental path\nthat has been interrupted while the young person has been ill. While staying on the\nUnit may be necessary for them, they cannot afford to disassociate themselves from the\ntime and space of the outside world too completely or for too long, as time and space are\nthe basic co-ordinates of existence \u2013 a part of the reality of life. In order to develop, they\nneed to re-engage with this reality, and for this they need strong, supportive footholds\noutside the Unit, particularly at the time of discharge.\nThe Unit as a retreat\nWhen thinking about ending this kind of treatment, it may be helpful to think about\nwhat is being left behind. The average length of an admission is five months, although\nsome patients with more severe conditions can sometimes stay for about a year. When a\nyoung person arrives in a particularly shut down state, I have often had the impression\nthat the Unit symbolises for them a place of ultimate retreat \u2013 the final stop in a refusal\nto engage with life in ordinary ways. At the same time, there is often a strong resistance\nto a psychological approach and attempts to understand what may be causing so much\npain in the mind. Wedded to the idea that their illness has an organic cause, the young\npeople often do not want to be on the Unit one bit. Sometimes, on the other hand, the\nyoung people can feel worryingly settled and there is an eerie feeling that this is less to\ndo with what the Unit is offering, and more to do with clutching ever more tightly to\nthe identity of being the illest child in hospital. There is powerful feeling of \u2018stuckness\u2019\nin this situation, very much along the lines of John Steiner\u2019s descriptions of \u2018psychic\nretreats\u2019 (Steiner, 1993).\nSo, being \u2018in\u2019 hospital and not \u2018out\u2019 in the world seems, in this way, to reflect a state\nof mind where progress is limited. Historically the child has physically been born into\nNEGOTIATING TIME 327\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:4\n4 \n18\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nthe world, located in time and space. This existence has been tried out, but something \u2013\nat some stage \u2013 has gone wrong. The emotional and psychological conflict involved\nseems to have been experienced as completely overwhelming. What has not been\npossible to work through, psychically, spills over into a physical expression in the body.\nUsing the body in this perverse way can put the young person in grave physical danger,\npainfully witnessed in somatic illnesses, including anorexia nervosa. When being in\nhospital represents being \u2018inside\u2019 in this unfruitful way, divorced from the reality of time\nand space, engaging a young person in treatment in a genuine way is an enormous\nchallenge, let alone imagining a time when they may be genuinely ready to end. Ending\nin this context may, for the child, mean leaving an unprofitable, risky but more\nemotionally unchallenging and therefore \u2018safe\u2019 haven and being open to real-life\nexperiences outside \u2013 that is, facing the monsters that felt sufficiently overwhelming to\ndrive them \u2018in\u2019 in the first place.\nI think there are some interesting parallels here with Jan Anderson\u2019s research into\nrisk-taking, dangerous behaviour in childhood, and the three different situations in\nwhich these occur, described as \u2018no haven\u2019, \u2018illusory haven\u2019 or \u2018perilous haven\u2019\n(Anderson, 2003).\nThe Unit as a prison\nAnother patient perspective of the Unit that emerges regularly is that of being inside a\nprison. Then the staff may be seen along the lines of prison warders, depriving patients\nof their freedom and individuality. Getting \u2018out\u2019 and going home for the weekend feels a\nbit like parole, and the treatment programme is looked at askance as something cruel\nand controlling. The weekly Ward Round is described, for example, by 11-year-old\nLouise, as the place where the \u2018fat cats\u2019 meet, interested only in their own greedy power\nto make punitive decisions about a young person\u2019s life. Sometimes one strand of the\ntreatment programme is idealised and another denigrated, each time afresh challenging\nthe team\u2019s capacity for thoughtfulness rather than acting out in ways that lead to staff\nfeeling fragmented and cut off from one another. This \u2018prison\u2019 Unit has retribution as its\nfocus more than rehabilitation and, for the child, ending treatment has little to do with\nmaking progress. In this context, discharge simply means \u2018release\u2019.\nThe Unit as a therapeutic space\nThe aim of the treatment programme is to help the young person make progress and\nmove forward. But the first task is to try and create a thinking space that redefines for\nthe patient what it means to be staying on the Unit. If they get too far in, it becomes like\na Meltzerian \u2018claustrum\u2019 (Meltzer, 1992), where thinking is not possible \u2013 at first more\nlike a place to hide and then its deterioration to a place where one feels imprisoned. But\nbeing outside has proved itself too overwhelming and something else is urgently needed.\nIf the Unit could be seen to function as a kind of transitional thinking space \u2013 on the\nboundary of inside and out \u2013 then some kind of therapeutic work may be possible. This\nkind of borderline position is perhaps particularly symbolised by the dynamics of the\nReview Meetings as the outpatient professionals are represented alongside the inpatient\n328 S. GUSTAVUS JONES\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:4\n4 \n18\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nteam as an inevitable part of reality and development. Maintaining itself as a transitional\nthinking space therefore seems to involve the Unit facing in two directions at the same\ntime: an equal focus not only on the therapeutic work as it happens on the Unit, but\nalso on the progressive moves outward, where real life is \u2013 with all its opportunities for\nfurther growth. Full rehabilitation can only happen in the context of ordinary life.\nEnding\nThere remains the question of how much therapeutic work is needed before discharging\na patient back into the community. This question is asked bearing in mind that the\nUnit does not aim to \u2018cure\u2019 patients before discharge, but rather to discharge them when\nthey are well enough to manage life outside, where the local CAMHS team can support\ntheir ongoing development and progress, in some way continuing the work started on\nthe Unit. Although the work of the Unit is made up of different strands, which feel\nimpossible to separate in terms of inpatient treatment outcome, it also seems helpful for\neach discipline to have a sense of what may be the necessary input in their particular area\nof work, and how this input may then interact with other strands of the inpatient\ntreatment to good effect and a positive outcome for the patient. Judith Trowell\u2019s\noutcome study on childhood depression (Trowell et al., 2007) has shown that time-\nlimited psychoanalytic psychotherapy is effective for lasting change, and this is\nparticularly encouraging in the context of inpatient units where input often coincides\nwith the minimum 30 sessions specified in Trowell\u2019s research.\nI shall now discuss a case in more detail to illustrate some of these issues.\nCase illustration: Peter\nAt the time of his admission, Peter was 13. His older 19-year-old sister had Downs\nSyndrome, and he also had two younger brothers, eight and four years old. Peter\u2019s\nparents were articulate, professional people, both Kenyan Asian and both working in\nresponsible positions in the field of engineering. They came to Britain from Kenya in\nthe early 1970s and now lived in a terraced house in a suburb of London.\nPeter\u2019s difficulties started after a bout of flu. He felt very nauseous and this put him\noff eating. He lost a significant amount of weight and needed a hospital admission for\nnasogastric tube feeding. At the same time, he was suffering from other physical\nsymptoms, especially pain in his arms, and he had some unusual physical movements. It\nwas unclear whether there were organic causes behind his symptoms and he had many\ntests. Peter was then assessed and given a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. He arrived at the\nUnit a week later, having dramatically lost weight again \u2013 his weight for height now\nbeing just over 60% (the healthy range is between 95% and 105% weight for height).\nPeter looked close to death and his appearance panicked the other children on the Unit,\nwho described him as a ghost. He was immediately transferred to a general paediatric\nward and was felt stable enough to return to the Unit the following week.\nWhen I first met Peter he was skeletal and in a wheelchair. His dark eyes looked huge\nand his cheekbones jutted out sharply. His black wavy hair fell across one side of his face\nin a striking way.\nNEGOTIATING TIME 329\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:4\n4 \n18\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nSession 1\nBecause of the very high level of anxiety in the room, I felt I needed to speak for a\nwhile, talking generally about once weekly individual psychotherapy on the Unit,\nand also trying to address some of Peter\u2019s possible concerns about it, not really\nknowing me, and so on. Peter jiggled his legs in a pronounced way, never taking\nhis seemingly unblinking eyes off me for a second, and was not forthcoming. He\neventually baldly said he had got flu and then couldn\u2019t eat \u2013 there was no build up.\nI said it must all feel very bewildering. Peter curtly nodded, his long hair now\ncovering more of his face. When I asked more about his experience since arriving\non the Unit, Peter was more communicative over medical issues. He highlighted\nsome disagreements and hinted at possible mistakes over his medical investigations.\nI said perhaps there was a question in his mind about whether the Unit was in fact\nthe right place for him, how strange it all felt, and could we even be trusted. Peter\nagreed with this. He was then able to tell me a bit about his family, the high\nprofessional status of his parents, how he looked out for his older sister, and also a\nfew details of his hobbies and interests before becoming ill.\nIt seemed that Peter needed to let me know something about his previous way of\nfunctioning, when he was the one doing the important, \u2018high status\u2019 job of caring \u2013\nlooking out for his sister \u2013 and what a shock it was to find himself in this different place,\nin the Unit and in therapy, where he was now the one who seemed to be in need. It just\ndid not feel right.\nIn Peter\u2019s third session, he talked about his family\u2019s involvement in their local church\nand how when Dad came to visit Peter on the Unit, he would read him a story from the\nBible. Peter always asked for the same one, his favourite one since becoming ill. It was\nthe story of Jonah and the Whale. I asked if he could tell me about it:\nSession 3\nPeter said that God wanted Jonah to go to Nineveh and lead the people there out\nof wrongdoing. But Jonah is scared and doesn\u2019t want to go. So he runs away to sea.\nHe finds a boat going somewhere but God sends a storm. At first Jonah hides but\nthen he feels guilty and tells the sailors to throw him out of the boat. He is\nswallowed by the whale and lives inside, where he praises God, and so the whale\nthrows him up, back on to the beach. Peter smiles a bit at this point. I asked what\nhappened to Jonah. Peter said he then went to Nineveh and did what God had\nwanted him to do in the first place.\nThe Prophet\u2019s Prayer is given in Jonah 2:\n. . . Out of the belly of hell cried I,\nAnd thou heardest my voice.\nFor thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas;\nAnd the floods compassed about:\nAll thy billows and thy waves passed over me.\nThen I said, I am cast out of thy sight;\n330 S. GUSTAVUS JONES\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:4\n4 \n18\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nYet I will look again toward thy holy temple;\nThe waters compassed me about, even to the soul:\nThe depth closed me round about,\nThe weeds were wrapped about my head;\nI went down to the bottoms of the mountains;\nThe earth with her bars was about me forever:\nYet hast thou brought my life from corruption, O Lord my God;\nWhen my soul fainted within me, I remembered the Lord . . .\nAnd the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.\nThe imagery of the prayer graphically illustrates Jonah\u2019s claustrophobia inside the \u2018belly\nof hell\u2019, as weeds wrap themselves around his head and the underwater earth imprisons\nhim \u2018with her bars\u2019. In the weeks that followed, we returned to the story a number of\ntimes, mainly linking it with Peter\u2019s current experience of feeling trapped inside the\nUnit, as in some kind of prison, which Peter readily agreed with. His fascination with\nthe story of Jonah and the Whale also seemed linked to it being a story between a father\nand a son. We talked about Peter\u2019s relationship with his own father, his concerns about\nhim during a period of gastric illness three years ago (from which father subsequently\nmade a full recovery). Peter\u2019s greatest fear, which he could not speak of and so wrote\ndown on paper, was that his father\u2019s illness would come back and he could die. The\npiece of paper remained in Peter\u2019s box, which he then did not open for a long time.\nIn the story of Jonah and the Whale, the son defies the authority of his father. But the\nfather\u2019s punishment is not straightforward, as the fish\u2019s \u2018belly of hell\u2019 also saves Jonah\u2019s\nlife, perhaps this being more linked to the idea of a possible retreat. Peter also seemed to\nrealise that the Unit had his best interests at heart but rather like God\u2019s provision of \u2018a\ngreat fish to swallow up Jonah\u2019 and save him from the raging seas, his current experience\non the Unit felt like a different kind of punitive torture. He now felt imprisoned and he\njust wanted out. He became a model patient on the Unit, eating all his meal plan,\ncontributing to groups, and so on. He wanted a discharge date and was doing many of\nthe right things to get it.\nAlthough Peter did use his individual sessions to talk, there were often occasions\nwhen I felt he seemed to be holding back. But while remaining adamant about not\naccepting the label of anorexia, he did tell me he sometimes felt flooded with thoughts\nabout eating before and around mealtimes, particularly a voice in his head that said, over\nand over: \u2018Don\u2019t eat, don\u2019t eat\u2019. What also began to emerge very clearly in both Peter\u2019s\nfamily and individual sessions, was his strong attachment to his mother and his feelings\nof powerful rivalry with his siblings and his father for her attention. This was also\nconfirmed in the transference relationship with me as Peter seemed particularly\ncompetitive with other patients of mine on the Unit. I also felt very aware of how closely\nwe seemed to walk together, up and down the stairs to his sessions, his step almost\nprecisely in time with my own; it felt like he was almost inside me. However, my feeling\nabout Peter \u2018holding back\u2019 remained and I began to wonder if discharge would be when\nwork with Peter could really develop. He was slowly but steadily putting on weight and\nhis thoughts about discharge now also generally seemed more realistic in the mind of the\nteam.\nNEGOTIATING TIME 331\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:4\n4 \n18\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nTeam discussion around discharge\nWhen approaching the end of an admission, various factors are considered that seem\nparticularly relevant to the decision of when a young person may be ready to leave and\ncope with the transition back to life outside the Unit.\nIndications of medical stability, in patients where this has been an issue, is a factor of\nprime importance. Family functioning also emerges as an important factor, as does the\navailability of adequate, ongoing local CAMHS support for the child and family.\nSuitable school provision and the identity of the child within a peer group are also\nhighly significant. The reality of NHS resources and the demand for inpatient beds is\nanother pressing consideration. Similarly, the young person\u2019s own motivation emerges\nas crucial at this stage \u2013 towards the end of treatment \u2013 not only in terms of what is said\nand therefore evident verbally, but also through signs of internal shifts in the child that\nindicate a capacity to re-engage with life outside in a lasting way. Decisions about when\nto stop need to be taken with all this in mind and when the decision does not seem\nstraightforward \u2013 as it rarely does \u2013 it can provoke anxiety and inevitable debate within\nthe multi-disciplinary team. Peter\u2019s case was no exception.\nThere is always a certain amount of anxiety around discharge and endings, and\ndiscussions in the inpatient team tend to reflect this, with different members of the team\nspeaking \u2018for\u2019 while others speak \u2018against\u2019. While the process can often feel very\nuncomfortable, on reflection it can also be recognised as helpful if it enables us to be\nmore in touch with the patient\u2019s and family\u2019s possible anxieties around ending. The\nteam can then experience, work through, and try and emotionally contain this on the\nfamily\u2019s behalf. But, at the same time, is the patient really ready to end now? Would a\nfew more weeks help to consolidate any progress that has been made?\nMedical\nAlthough still thin, Peter was now medically stable, and he was steadily gaining weight\neach week. It was reassuring that Peter would, when the time was right, be discharged to\nan outpatient CAMHS team experienced in eating disorders.\nCAMHS provision\nThe outpatient CAMHS team felt confident about Peter and had experience of working\nwith similar low weight patients on an outpatient basis. Peter\u2019s individual psychotherapy\nsessions could continue with me, and family sessions, a parents\u2019 support group and a young\npeople\u2019s group could also be offered. The outpatient package was therefore substantial.\nFamily functioning\nBy now, Peter had been going home for weekends on a regular basis. There had been\nissues around anger and control at home, especially around mealtimes. More recently,\nPeter had been showing his anger particularly towards his father \u2013 with a number of\nepisodes of shouting, biting, kicking and scratching. It felt significant that Peter\u2019s parents\n332 S. GUSTAVUS JONES\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:4\n4 \n18\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nwere able to be very open and realistic about the difficulties they were experiencing. This\nthen enabled them to work closely with the inpatient team during such times. They now\nfelt more confident about managing Peter at home and they were keen for discharge.\nPeer group and school\nPeter was now regularly meeting old friends over the weekends at home. A gradual\nschool reintegration programme looked feasible, and when this started Peter seemed to\nbe managing well.\nMotivation\nPeter seemed highly motivated, looking forward to discharge, and keen to be back at\nschool and at home with his family. He was also willing to work on his ongoing\ndifficulties on an outpatient basis.\nInternal shifts\nMy feeling was that it was still early days for Peter and the nursing team also expressed\nsome concern about Peter\u2019s inpatient admission feeling somehow \u2018too easy\u2019. On the\nother hand, he had used his individual sessions well in terms of talking about his\ndifficulties \u2013 feelings of rivalry, anxiety about his father\u2019s health, worries about eating,\nand so on. I felt reassured that I could continue with Peter as an outpatient where\nfurther progress could be made. I also thought Peter\u2019s wish to leave hospital was more\nhealthy than not wanting to leave.\nExternal pressure\nThe reality of the NHS is that there can be some pressure on beds, with the team aware,\nthrough Referrals Meetings, of other potential patients waiting in urgent need. Patient\nturnover is also a factor that seems to identify inpatient Units as working well, so helping\nthe Unit\u2019s profile in a generally pressurised climate of NHS cuts. As the discussions around\npossible discharge continued, Peter had now reached 85% weight for height.\nDecision\nOn balance, it was felt that Peter was ready for discharge. At his third Review Meeting, a\ndischarge date was set with the time and date of Peter\u2019s Leaving Drinks confirmed.\nThe reason I chose to discuss Peter\u2019s discharge in particular is that, very unusually,\nfive months later he was readmitted to the Unit. His weight had dropped from 85% to\n70% weight for height. Could there be a way to have predicted that Peter was not ready\nfor discharge? Every situation contains its own complexities, and such situations are\nalways opportunities for reflection. In hindsight and with some close retrospective\nconsideration of Peter\u2019s case, it may be possible to identify what essential ingredient was\nmissing in terms of his capacity to cope as an outpatient.\nNEGOTIATING TIME 333\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:4\n4 \n18\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nPeter\u2019s struggle as an outpatient\nInitially Peter\u2019s family coped well and supported Peter through his difficulties with\neating, which continued to be an ongoing and time-consuming struggle. However, the\nfamily was thrown into crisis by a series of very distressing and tragic events a few\nmonths later, including the sudden death of maternal grandmother. Apart from Peter\u2019s\nown feelings of loss, his grief-stricken parents were temporarily less able make his eating\ndifficulties the focus of their attention and he needed to fit in with the family more.\nPeter found this very difficult to accept and mealtimes became arenas of potentially\nexplosive tension.\nAround this time, when Peter began to lose weight again, I began to experience a\ngrowing sense of unpredictability in his outpatient sessions. I felt his eyes on me again in\nan unblinking way, and I felt he was looking at me with a kind of hatred. But it was\nconfusing, as he also seemed to be clinging to me with his eyes. I felt very unsure how\nI could take this up with Peter.\nTo try and distract himself at home around this time, Peter began writing a story,\nwhich he brought to his sessions.\nSession 28\nPeter told me his story was about two characters who needed to escape an Evil\nKing. They spent a long time burrowing through a tunnel before going on a raft\nand heading towards a beach. They thought at one point that the Evil King was\ndead but then discovered in fact he was alive again. The beach was a way out, but\nthere was also danger there.\nIn his next session, Peter was listless, and told me everyone at home had given up.\nEveryone was \u2018flat\u2019. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d contributed to this. I mentioned my hearing\nthat he had been hiding food, which he hadn\u2019t told me about. Peter vaguely said he\nhadn\u2019t really thought about it. The session continued:\nSession 29\nI said I thought something was also happening here, between us, which may need\ntalking about. Peter looked more interested. I said I thought he was, in one way,\nworking in his sessions \u2013 talking about his story, etc. \u2013 but also that he left things\nout, and some things, particularly linked to his eating, remained hidden. Peter gave\nme a chilling look. I said I also thought that although he seemed to genuinely\nappreciate our time, there was a part of him that hated it, and hated me for\nbringing these things to the surface. Peter smiled and said he thought it was true.\nI said when he looked at me sometimes I could feel it very strongly, like just a\nmoment ago. What seemed important was that I could know these things about\nhim \u2013 the hidden secrets \u2013 and could be resilient enough to face the truth about it,\nnot give up or be defeated. We needed to work with this in mind. The \u2018flatness\u2019\nseemed like a way out for him too, but it felt dangerous, less engaged, less human.\nPeter went on to describe more about his story. He said the slaves of the Evil\nKing had gone after the two characters who escaped to the beach, but some slaves\n334 S. GUSTAVUS JONES\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:4\n4 \n18\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nstayed with the King. In the end, the King was killed and the two characters on the\nraft reached the beach, but a small black fish\/snake slipped back into the water.\nIn the following two sessions, Peter remained listless. He talked about his anorexia as\n\u2018Chuck\u2019. I found myself becoming more challenging, commenting that he often agreed\nwith what I said, but nothing seemed to have any impact. I said I thought Chuck\nsounded too friendly \u2013 how about the black slippery fish\/snake, a part of himself in\nleague with the slaves that never really left the Evil King. Peter responded by struggling\nto try and explain something to me about muscle.\nSession 32\nI was shocked. Peter looked like a skeleton again. He said he\u2019d had a bug and\ncouldn\u2019t eat during part of the week. He said he knew he was coming back into\nhospital. He felt really disappointed. The atmosphere in the room was very heavy\nand Peter was struggling to speak. He drew a picture of himself on medication,\nsmiling, but he said he couldn\u2019t think or feel anything. Then he drew a picture of\nhimself off medication, with a blank face. When I commented on the blank face he\nsaid, \u2018I don\u2019t know something\u2019. Peter quickly scribbled down lots of goals, the\nmost striking being something about the need to develop physical strength,\nmuscle . . . I wondered what he thought had happened. Was it something to do\nwith the black slippery fish\/snake? Peter said he didn\u2019t think it was exactly that, but\nsomething like that.\nWhat these events seemed to confirm was that the changes seen in Peter while he was an\ninpatient on the Unit were essentially external changes and, when under pressure, they\ncould not sustain him outside. The crises in the family then made the home structure\nmore fragile than it may have been otherwise. To cope with life outside, a patient needs\nto have developed a certain level of internal capacity, which can then link with enough\nparental resilience to bear the strain of the child. During his inpatient stay, Peter had\ntalked about important things, but there had been no significant internal shift, which\nindicated a new capacity in Peter to re-engage with life outside in a lasting way. This is\nwhat seemed to be missing. The nurses felt it was \u2018too easy\u2019 and internal shifts do not\ncome so easily. Outside was a new world to him, and when he said \u2018I don\u2019t know\nsomething\u2019 it seemed that he really didn\u2019t know where he was in this new world.\nFrom the perspective of psychoanalytic psychotherapy input as part of Peter\u2019s\ntreatment programme, it is interesting that my last individual session with Peter as in\ninpatient was session 15 \u2013 half the time recommended by Judith Trowell\u2019s study to\nsupport lasting change.\nSecond admission\nOn his second admission, Peter was again dangerously underweight. A few weeks into\nthe admission, he asked for a second individual session, as he was finding the waiting\nparticularly hard. We agreed this would be helpful, although for practical reasons it\nwould not be possible for a while.\nNEGOTIATING TIME 335\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:4\n4 \n18\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nPeter talked about the second admission being different from the first and he didn\u2019t\nlike it. I commented that he was not being the \u2018good boy\u2019 of the first admission. In fact,\nPeter was being very tricky with lots of spilling and smearing food at mealtimes. He also\nwanted to be in the kitchen when the nurses were preparing the food; it had been the\nsame when he was at home with his mother. Now, on the Unit, the nurses were\nsimilarly being driven to distraction. When I tried to explore this with Peter he told me\nhe thought the nurses were \u2018doing something\u2019 to his food. I asked if this was related to\nportion size? Peter said, \u2018No\u2019. I asked what he thought they were doing then. \u2018Meddling\nwith it,\u2019 he replied. I asked if he thought the nurses were trying to poison him. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he\nsaid. We clarified that he had had the same feelings at home and Peter agreed that he\nwould find pre-meal support from nurses helpful, addressing this issue directly. This was\nsubsequently arranged. I was also able to address Peter\u2019s suspicions about me and our\nwork together. What was I up to?\nPeter then told me about an upsetting incident at school, related to his current\npreoccupation with avoiding fat and developing muscle, which he said happened when\nhe returned after his first hospital admission. Three boys in the playground had teased\/\nbullied him saying, \u2018They sent you away to get fat, and now you\u2019re back,\u2019 implying that\nhe had returned fattened up. Something about the story felt very humiliating. There was\na feeling that Peter needed muscular support, both physically and emotionally.\nSession 37\nIn Peter\u2019s session before the Easter break he arrived very tearful, saying he\nthought the nurses were angry with him and had given up on him, giving an\nexample of an incident with a fruit smoothie at breakfast time. Reading between\nthe lines, it sounded to me as though Peter was being tricky but the nurses were\nportrayed by him as cruel and at fault. The idea of the Unit as a prison emerged\nvery strongly again, with the nurses as prison warders. When I suggested this\nPeter agreed that this is what it felt like. I said I was having another idea, that his\nanorexia was holding him prisoner, like a kind of hostage, pushing him to smear,\nhide food, water down his juice in the fridge, take advantage of any second a\nnurse\u2019s back was turned, any moment of human error on their part, like the\nexample of the fruit smoothie. This was the world he was living in and it was a\nterrible one. Peter nodded. I said this world seemed to get muddled up in his\nmind with the Unit and the nurses, who were actually trying to pull him out of\nthe anorexia prison he was in. There was a pause and I wondered how I might\nfit into all this. Perhaps in the anorexia world I was meant to be the one he\ncould dupe, pull the wool over my eyes, play down the anorexia and all his\nbehaviours around food. But it seemed helpful that I could, in fact, see the\nwhole picture in a real way.\nI wondered, also, with a two-week break coming up, whether it felt like I too\nwas giving up on him. We had a few minutes left of the session and I wondered\nhow he may feel able to hold onto our work together over the break. Peter said\nhe didn\u2019t know how to do it and began to cry. I said it felt very difficult for him\nand after some moments I suggested that Peter may find it helpful to write\nsomething down in the break, perhaps a book in which he could write a little bit\n336 S. GUSTAVUS JONES\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:4\n4 \n18\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nevery day, as if he was talking to me \u2013 he could see if it worked for him. Maybe\nhe would find it helpful to try very hard and notice not only what he was\nthinking about but also what he did \u2013 there could be a separate column for each.\nPeter seemed to catch hold of this idea and nodded. I walked with Peter back up\nto the Unit and there was a noticeable firmness in the way we made eye contact\nand said goodbye.\nAt the end of a session and just before a break, Peter seemed to be dissolving into water\nas he cried and said he didn\u2019t know how to hold on to our work together. This may link\nto his earlier experience of being discharged before he had the internal capacity to cope\nmore independently with life outside the Unit. With moments to go before the session\nwas due to end, I was faced with a decision about technique and the introduction of an\nidea that is not necessarily common practice in psychoanalytic psychotherapy. I felt, at\nthis point, however, that I needed to give Peter something rather physical, the idea of a\nbook, to hold on to in his mind, perhaps a kind of external support which he seemed to\nneed in order to (a) leave the session, and (b) to keep in touch with our work over the\nbreak. I wonder if this departure in terms of technique is particularly relevant to patients\nwho tend to somatise their difficulties, and are not yet at the stage of having developed a\nmore muscular support internally. Possibly the two columns I suggested \u2013 thinking and\ndoing \u2013 gives some kind of acknowledgement to this stage of development, while also\ntrying to encourage Peter to link these two distinct areas in his mind, and take\nresponsibility for them both, which the somatising aspects of his illness seem so\ndetermined to avoid. These kinds of departures in technique are certainly subject to\ndebate.\nMeanwhile, something more robust seemed to be developing at home. Peter was now\nwell enough to leave the Unit at weekends but at home was being very demanding of all\nhis mother\u2019s time. Dad finally put his foot down and one morning insisted Peter stay\nwith him while mother spent time with Peter\u2019s sister and brothers. Peter became furious\nand attacked Dad \u2013 shouting and hitting him. But Dad remained firm and the family\nwere able to have a good afternoon in the end. In the same session, Peter complained\nabout the attention the busy nurses gave all the other children on the Unit and we were\nable to link this with mother giving attention to his siblings and, to top it all, he was still\nhaving to wait for a second session with me.\nThree dreams\nIn the weeks that followed, something seemed to change. Peter brought a series of\ndreams and I would like to describe this material in more detail:\nSession 39\nPeter began the session by telling me, with a hint of amusement, about a\nlongstanding dispute his father was having with their neighbours on one side,\nabout a boundary garden fence issue between the two properties.\nPeter went on to talk about going home for the weekend, how he was looking\nforward to it, and it felt better as he was more in the routine of being on the Unit\nNEGOTIATING TIME 337\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:4\n4 \n18\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nand spending weekends at home now. I said that made me remember the previous\nweekend at home, when he\u2019d had an argument with Dad. It made me think of his\ndad as the boundary keeper, not only of his land \u2013 as in the garden fence story \u2013\nbut also of his mum when Peter wanted to spend all the time with her, almost get\nright inside her \u2013 something we had talked about a lot together. Peter said it was\nlike that.\nI said it felt really hard for him when mum spent time with anyone else, Dad\nincluded \u2013 at one point there was an upset over his dad sleeping with his mum\nwhen Peter wanted her to sleep with him. It was very strong, this wish to have all\nof mum for himself. It also made me think of some difficulties he had with me\nseeing other patients on the Unit and the issue of our sessions having a boundary\naround them \u2013 a start and end time. And he was still needing to wait for a second\nsession, until it was possible for me to arrange it \u2013 stay within that boundary, very\nfrustrating.\nA little later in the session, Peter told me the following dream:\nDream One\nI was playing tennis with my friend Siddesh and some other people. We were playing\nthis game \u2013 King, Queen, Jack, Peasant. Then Siddesh hit the ball to me and it went\nover the high net around the court. Because I missed it, the tennis coach said I was out\nand I got upset. Then on the way home in the car, Siddesh was saying how he had been\nKing twice and I said how I had been King once.\nWe talked about Siddesh being his good friend and they liked to play football\ntogether now, although they used to play tennis when they were in primary school.\nPeter also explained about the tennis game: all the peasants go on one side of the\nnet and the King, Queen and Jack go on the other. The peasants take it in turns to\nhit the ball and if the Jack misses, he swaps and becomes a peasant, going to the\nback of the queue; if the Queen misses, the Jack becomes the Queen and\nthe Queen becomes a peasant, and so on. Peter confirmed he was the Queen in the\ndream when he missed the ball. I wondered how fair it was \u2013 Siddesh had hit the\nball so high, over the surrounding net, so it seemed impossible to hit back, but\nPeter was still out. Peter agreed. I asked about the tennis coach and Peter said he\nhad had two \u2013 the first, who he preferred, was more fun but the second was more\nserious about tennis.\nI talked about how interesting Peter\u2019s dream was and how it made me think of\nthe King and Queen on one side of the net, with their special child, the Jack, and\nall the other children peasants on the other side. The object of the game seemed to\nbe to become King, a bit like the children trying to knock a dad-king out of his\nplace and replace him alongside the Queen, like the younger part of Peter himself\nwanting to knock dad out and have his mum all to himself.\nI said the theme of competition seemed to be strong in the dream, not only to\nbe king but also amongst the peasants, and especially between him and Siddesh.\nPerhaps again it was something about competitiveness with his sister and brothers\nin the family for mum.\n338 S.

I wondered\nwho would have had most attention before he got ill. \u2018Ruth,\u2019 said Peter, without a\nmoment\u2019s hesitation. I agreed, probably because of her special needs. And then,\nwhen his younger brothers came along, babies needed lots of attention. Perhaps\ngiving up anorexia may feel like a risk in terms of attention, looked at in that way.\nPerhaps here too, as he saw new patients coming in and taking up more attention\non the Unit. Maybe it seemed harder for him to imagine that moving forward and\nmaking progress could establish a different kind of attention in his parents\u2019 and my\nmind, where he could be held and thought about but at the same time feel he\ncould develop in a different direction and get on with his life.\nThe following session Peter arrived at my room with a face like thunder. Whatever I said\nwas wrong, and he wasted no time telling me so.\nSession 41\nIn his next session I tentatively mentioned the King, Queen, Jack, Peasant dream\nto Peter again and said I felt our discussion about it had put him in touch with his\nposition as one of the children, or peasants, in a way that I thought made sense to\nhim, but was also difficult for him to hear and come to terms with. Despite our\nprevious discussions along the same lines, the dream seemed to confirm something\nfor him on a different kind of emotional level \u2013 not just an intellectual idea \u2013 and it\nwasn\u2019t easy. I thought he appreciated my thinking with him about it but at the\nsame time felt angry with me for seeming to make him see himself in a different\nlight \u2013 it seemed like the end of an era in the way he viewed himself in relation to\nhis parents, no longer the chosen Jack alongside the King and Queen, but in the\nqueue with all the other children. At first, Peter said that what I just said didn\u2019t\nmake sense, and when I repeated the same thing he said that now I had hit the nail\non the head. I said he seemed to both agree and really want to disagree.\nA little later, Peter then said he was now remembering a dream that he had\nwhen he was about eight, that was probably irrelevant. I encouraged him to tell it\nto me anyway.\nDream Two\nMe and my friend Lewis were in school. We had a pack of cards. Inside the pack there\nwas sometimes a gift. I opened the pack and the gift was a tazzer \u2013 a round disc; I\u2019ve got\na collection of them. The picture on the tazzer was of a hedgehog, upended with gas\ncoming out, with fire. Then me and Lewis went into the green field.\nWhen Peter had described the tazzer he seemed to hold it up to his face as he\ntalked about the picture. I commented that he seemed to be describing a kind of\nfiery fart coming out of the hedgehog. He agreed. I said I thought Peter\nNEGOTIATING TIME 339\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:4\n4 \n18\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nmentioning the dream now was significant and wondered if it may\nconfirm something of what we had just been talking about. The pack of cards\nseemed linked to the King, Queen, Jack, Peasant dream and although he had some\nunderstanding of his dilemma in relation to his parents before we discussed the\ndream, something did seem more real now, as we had said. I asked Peter what he\nthought about the green field? He said he didn\u2019t know. I said it was an outside\nspace though, not stuck inside. He agreed. I said the prickly hedgehog did make\nme think of him last week when he had been rather cross and prickly with me in\nthe session. I thought perhaps the fiery fart was one in the face for me, for putting\nhim in touch with these things and now there was the half term break. Peter\nlaughed and said he thought that sounded right.\nSession 42\nIn the next session, and following a week\u2019s half term break, Peter first told me\nrather crossly how he felt excluded from the social life of the family while he was\nstuck on the Unit. He then told me the third dream:\nDream Three\nI was in a field, the grass was like a football field. I was with some others and we were\nrunning around the edge of the field. The field was surrounded by a kind of hedge or\nbush and the way out, a small muddy path, was in the top right hand corner. Outside\nwas another field with cabbages growing in it.\nAs I asked questions about the dream, Peter suggested he could draw it (Figure 1).\nHe said the \u2018others\u2019 were his own age. The muddy path would be a bit difficult to\nget through because of the mud, not as easy as going around the field. The\ncabbages were neatly planted, with a square of earth around each one, but they\nwere a funny colour, a bit brown at the base. Later he added that they were rotting\ninto the earth. I asked and Peter confirmed that he didn\u2019t like cabbage at all and\nyes, it was on his list of \u2018hate foods\u2019.\nAs we were talking Peter said he was now remembering the end of the dream:\nOn the outside of the cabbage field there was a tree with a muddy patch around it and\nbushes behind. Then the small muddy path opened out into a wider track. Beyond the\nfield was something else, but he didn\u2019t know what this was \u2013 it wasn\u2019t like the cabbage\nfield that he could see in the dream.\nPeter turned the paper over and began to draw the second part of the dream\n(Figure 2). I asked about the tree. He said the leaves were colourful but not the\nfruit \u2013 they were a bit like black baubles on a Christmas tree, but not quite. It\nmade him think of the Adam and Eve tree a bit. I tried to explore which way Peter\nwent in the dream. He said the tree was a kind of choice. You could either go the\nway of the wider track, into the place he didn\u2019t know, but what would be worse\nwould be to go behind the bushes, which were behind the tree.\n340 S.

Peter remembered it was the story of Jonah and the Whale.\nI talked about that being about a son going against the father \u2013 Jonah didn\u2019t do\nwhat God asked at first. Also Adam and Eve went against what God had asked\nand then hid behind the bushes in the garden, a bit like the bushes behind the\ntree in his dream. I linked the boundary of the football field in his picture to\nthe boundary fence of his father\u2019s land \u2013 at the time we had talked about his\nfather being the boundary keeper for his mother. The King, Queen, Jack,\nPeasant dream also showed a younger Peter trying to knock out the father\nKing and take his place with mother. I wondered if this dream today was also\nsomehow about that, a story about his movements from an inside place to\noutside, but then, on the boundary is the tree, which is like a temptation or\nchoice, perhaps linked to the black slippery fish\/snake part of himself in\nrelation to the father in his mind.\nAt this point the atmosphere in the session became tense and I felt Peter became\nanxious. I said there seemed to be so much about punishment in the dream.\nI wondered if this was linked to the father in his mind, who was very different from\nhis real father. His real father was interested in him getting better, not in\npunishment. Peter said he thought the dream was more a story about the future,\nnot about a mother and father at all. I wondered if it could perhaps be linked to\nboth. But I asked if what I had said had frightened him. Peter said it had a bit. The\ntension in session had now eased and I talked about the idea of interest, helping\nhim to know more about himself, nothing to do with punishment, which was\nmore in his mind.\nWe had five minutes to go and I talked about his writing on the picture: \u2018not\nhaving the time to look at the future in the dream\u2019. I said next week I could\nconfirm when a second session could start. Peter said he would like to have two\nsessions. We talked about how the gap between sessions made it much more\ndifficult for him to stay linked with the work, especially when there was a break\nlike the week before. He may be more inclined to retreat to a different kind of\ninside place then. Two sessions would be better.\nThe significance of reaching dream material\nWhat is the significance of reaching dream material? Perhaps it is something to do with\nPeter\u2019s interest in the reality of his internal world \u2013 no longer just preoccupied with\nissues around weight\/meal plans\/targets or the \u2018too easy\u2019 process of the first admission,\nbut rather a developing interest in what it means to have an experience, an interest\nin mental \u2018muscle\u2019. In this context, it may be interesting to explore a contrast between\n\u2018fat\u2019 \u2013 as some kind of \u2018layer\u2019 \u2013 and \u2018muscle\u2019, more linked to the idea of food turned into\nstrength through the digestion process. When Peter was discharged after his first\nadmission, he said the boys at school said he was sent away to get \u2018fat\u2019 and now he was\nback. The question now was: Was something different happening in Peter\u2019s experience\nof the second admission? Does the movement seen in his dream material, and the\nexperience of his second admission, indicate internal shifts that were sufficient to go\n342 S. GUSTAVUS JONES\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:4\n4 \n18\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\ndeep enough into Peter\u2019s mind to influence at the level of \u2018muscle\u2019 \u2013 both bodily and\nmental muscle?\nCertainly, the balance of Peter\u2019s preoccupation with body and mind seemed to be\nchanging. The working through of Oedipal issues seemed to have helped Peter\nrecognise, at a deeper level, something of the \u2018essential facts of life\u2019 referred to by\nMoney-Kyrle (1968), as he entered the new era of finding his place as one of the\nchildren, rather than, as Steiner puts it, \u2018turning a blind eye\u2019 (Steiner, 1985) and\nmaintaining the \u2018Oedipal illusion\u2019, referred to by Britton, of being his mother\u2019s partner\n(Britton, 1989). As new concepts related to the Oedipal story build up, Peter\u2019s mind\nseemed to be developing, and there may be some movement towards the depressive\nposition with the resolution of the Oedipus Complex, in the direction that Britton\nsuggests (Britton, 1985).\nThe mind, where the imagination lies, was now centre stage in Peter\u2019s therapy. And\nthere seemed to be a place in his dream world for living in time and space, located, as\nMoney-Kyrle (1968) puts it, \u2018in a time\u2013space system\u2019. The places in Peter\u2019s dreams are\nall distinctively located in time and space. There is, in this sense, a kind of building up\nof a three dimensional space in his internal world. And all the dreams have movement in\nthem. The dimensionality Peter seemed to be beginning to acquire, represented in the\ndreams, does, I think, seem to show some degree of internal shift that indicated Peter\nwas now more ready than before to leave treatment as an inpatient, and go out and\nengage in time and space in a progressive developmental way. There the struggle will\ncontinue, with Peter either moving outwards towards the \u2018wider track\u2019 and the\nunknown future, or retreating back in the direction of the narrow muddy path. Despite\nit still being early days for Peter, his third dream seemed to illustrate some new and\nmore positive options.\nAt this point in Peter\u2019s treatment, timing was again crucial, as a period of\nconsolidation would be needed before discharge \u2013 a time to firm up and strengthen the\ninternal muscle that showed signs of beginning to form. This period of consolidation\nshould not be too short, but just as crucially, neither should it be too long and generally\nseems to be a matter of six weeks or so, usually coinciding with a planned school\nreintegration programme that progressively builds up days attended each week. In fact,\ntime does not stand still and young people like Peter need to step back in with the flow,\nalong the regular continuum of space and time, in order to exist in reality. This is where\nthey can begin to grow and test their muscle. The Unit is a transitional space, not a\nplace to live.\nThe Unit as a microcosm\nI have sometimes thought about the Unit as a kind of microcosm of therapeutic\nexperience, and that some of the themes around the timing of ending work here also\nresonate with the experience of ending psychoanalytic psychotherapy in more general\noutpatient settings. Essentially, for me, this involves the idea of the physical entity of the\nUnit being, in various ways, symbolic of \u2018inside states of mind\u2019, which can incarcerate or\nhide away inpatients and outpatients alike. The movement necessary to stimulate the\npatient\u2019s progress from states of projective identification may also be evidenced through\nNEGOTIATING TIME 343\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:4\n4 \n18\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nsimilar kinds of internal shifts. Whereas for the inpatient the ending generally needs to\nbe the beginning of outpatient work, for the outpatient, ending is more conclusive in\nterms of treatment, but it is, perhaps, also the beginning of something else too \u2013 that is,\nthe ongoing struggle to stay predominantly in the depressive position in the recognition\nthat Bion\u2019s (1970) formulation of PS !D travels both ways. Along the lines of the\nchallenge facing Peter, it seems that the timing of ending needs to coincide with\ndevelopment of the emotional muscle to experience being \u2018outside\u2019 the object in a more\nlasting way, in favour of real relationships in the world and with one\u2019s own internal\nparents.\nDCAMH\nMildred Creak Unit\nGreat Ormond Street Hospital for Children\nGreat Ormond Street\nLondon WC1N 3JH\ne-mail: Jones58@gosh.nhs.uk\nReferences\nANDERSON, J.
