Introduction\nThere has been considerable recent interest in clean air technologies for power\ngeneration for both stationary and mobile applications. Fuel cell technologies are at\nthe forefront of the effort towards green and sustainable energy generation. For\nmobile applications, the emphasis has been placed on lower temperature types (<\n150\u00b0C) including hydrogen fuelled (overall reaction: H2 + O2 \b H2O) alkaline fuel\ncells (AFCs) and proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), and the direct\nmethanol fuel cell (DMFC) (overall reaction: CH3OH + 3\/2O2 \b CO2 + 2H2O) [1,2].\nDMFCs are of primary interest in the field of mobile devices (e.g. laptop computers),\ndue to ease and speed (instantaneous) of refuelling and the large volumetric energy\ndensity of the liquid methanol fuel. Such low temperature portable DMFCs are\nexpected to be the first type of fuel cells to be commercially available on a wide scale\nand in the hands of general consumers.\nThere is extensive worldwide research being conducted on replacement proton\nexchange membranes (PEMs) [3] and electrocatalysts for DMFCs [4]. The main\nproblems with current generation PEMs (such as Nafion\u00ae produced by DuPont) are\nhigh methanol permeabilities (from anode to cathode), which result in wasted fuel and\nlow power densities in DMFCs [5], and high cost. In the low pH regime inherent with\nPEMs, the oxygen reduction reaction is electrokinetically slow resulting in high\ncathode activation overpotentials (a significant cause of power loss in PEMFCs). The\nanodic electrooxidation of methanol (6e- reaction) is also an inherently sluggish\nreaction at low pH, which reduces the performances of DMFCs even further and leads\n3to the necessity for unsustainable high loadings of complex and expensive catalysts\n(e.g. Pt\/Ru of approximately 2 \u2013 4 mg cm-2 metal loadings).\nThe application of alkaline anion-exchange membranes (AAEMs) in fuel cells is a\nradical step that potentially allows the achievement of enhanced performances in\nhydrogen-fuelled (especially with the use of reformed hydrogen containing CO\ncontaminant, a significant Pt catalyst poison at low pH) and direct liquid methanol\nfuelled fuel cells. AAEMs potentially remove several of the problems associated with\ntraditional aqueous potassium hydroxide electrolyte alkaline fuel cells, principal\namong them destructive carbonate\/hydrogen carbonate precipitation at the electrodes.\nThe issues, advantages and challenges with the use of AAEMs in fuel cells have been\ncomprehensively detailed in a recent review [6] and will not be repeated here. A\ndiscussion of the thermodynamic considerations when using AAEMs in fuel cells has\nalso been recently published [7].\nThe potential advantages when using AAEMs are summarised below:\n1) Reduced methanol crossover because the conduction pathway of the OH- ions\nproceeds from the cathode to the anode (opposite direction to proton migration in\nfuel cells involving PEMs); this and electro-osmotic drag oppose the direction of\nmethanol flux through the membrane. Reduced methanol crossover will allow the\nuse of thinner, less resistive membranes, improving fuel cell performances\nsignificantly.\n2) Electrocatalysis of each of hydrogen oxidation, methanol oxidation, and oxygen\nreduction reactions in alkaline media (high pH regime) is more facile, enabling the\n4use of a wider range of catalysts (including cheaper non-noble metals e.g. nickel\nand silver [8,9]).\n3) This larger repertoire of catalysts should allow the selection of a cathode catalyst\nthat is inactive towards methanol oxidation, reducing crossover performance\nlosses even further.\n4) Reduction of flooding at the cathode in direct methanol fuel cells and better\noverall water management leading to simplified balance of plant (essential with\npassive DMFCs for portable devices).\n5) At high in situ pH, the oxidative radical mechanism for polymer degradation is\nsuppressed [10] and potentially enables the use of hydrocarbon only membranes\n(C-H backbone) with enhanced green credentials (manufacturing and disposal)\nwhen compared with inherently expensive fluorine-containing polymers.\nAn initial study on the operation of DMFC with a commercial anion-exchange\nmembrane (Morgane\u00ae ADP membrane, Solvay S.A. Belgium) have been conduced by\nScott et al; maximum power densities of around 11 mW cm-2 and limiting current\ndensities of around 70 mA cm-2 were obtained when Pt\/C electrodes when used at the\nanode and cathode of alkaline membrane DMFCs with air at the cathode [11]. The\nbest performances were obtained when the gas diffusion layer was omitted from the\nanode and with non-teflonised carbon paper; humidification of the cathode air stream\nfurther improved performances (expected as water is essential at the cathode in order\nto form the OH- conducting species). Similar performances were also obtained when\nplatinised titanium mesh anodes were employed along with Pt\/C-type cathodes [12].\nThe methanol solutions (1 to 4 mol dm-3) were all made from aqueous sodium\nhydroxide (1 mol dm-3); other fundamental electrochemical studies demonstrate that\n5electro-oxidation of methanol at the anode is improved at higher pH (higher NaOH\nconcentrations) due to improved OH- surface concentrations on the Pt catalyst\nparticles [13,14]. The Morgane\u00ae ADP membrane exhibited a resistance across the\nmembrane (termed the normal direction as opposed to the tangential surface\nresistance) that was 600% the value observed with Nafion\u00ae, which was a factor that\nwas responsible for the limited fuel cell performances observed. The methanol\ndiffusion coefficients in Nafion\u00ae, however, was about 280% that found for the\nMorgane\u00ae ADP membrane, indicating that lower methanol crossover is obtainable\nwith this commercially developed AAEM [11.] However, the Morgane\u00ae ADP\nmembrane discoloured when immersed in aqueous sodium hydroxide (1 mol dm-3),\nsymptomatic of the presence of some chemical instability under such conditions [11].\nSimilar performances were also found in DMFCs and direct ethylene glycol fuel cells\ncontaining another commercial anion-exchange membrane (Tokuyama AHA\nmembrane, Tokuyama Co. Japan). Interestingly, the power densities obtained with\nethylene glycol were superior to performances with methanol [15], which strongly\nindicates that the use of AAEMs in fuel cells can broaden the choice of the liquid\nfuels at the anode to include alcohols other than methanol in direct alcohol fuel cells.\nA significant proportion of previous fuel cell membrane research has examined the\nradiation-grafting of styrene into non-fluorinated (e.g. LDPE), partially fluorinated\n(e.g. PVDF) and fully fluorinated films (e.g. FEP), with subsequent sulfonation to\nyield PEMs [16,17]. The properties and compositions of the final materials can easily\ncontrolled with this methodology [18,19]; radiation-grafted PEMs have been tested in\nDMFC mode and significantly exhibit lowered in situ methanol permeabilities\n[20,21]. Radiation-grafted PVDF-based cation- and anion-exchange membranes have\n6also been successfully applied to salt-splitting technologies [22-24]. Radiation\ngrafting methodology produces ionomer membranes cheaply and has two major\nadvantages: (1) preformed commercial polymer films are modified, alleviating the\nneed for film formation steps; (2) the availability of a wealth of adjustable\nexperimental parameters (e.g. radiation dose \/ type, temperature, film thickness)\nallowing a large degree of tailorability and customisation.\nThe radiation grafting of vinylbenzyl chloride (VBC) into FEP (forming intermediate\nFEP-g-PVBC) [25-27] with subsequent amination with trimethylamine and ion-\nexchange with aqueous potassium hydroxide yields alkaline, as opposed to acidic\n(proton-conducting), membranes (FEP-g-PVBTMAOH, Scheme 1). Preliminary\ninvestigations on such RG-AAEMs at Surrey have demonstrated that partially\nfluorinated films (such as PVDF, containing both C-F and C-H backbone\ncomponents) are inappropriate starting films for the manufacture of such membranes\nin alkaline (OH-) form due to chemical degradation caused by dehydrofluorination.\nHowever, these preliminary studies demonstrated that fully fluorinated FEP-derived\nAAEMs retained structural and ion exchange (chemical) integrity even when heated\nat 60\u00b0C for over 2500 h in water while open to air (and therefore carbon dioxide) [26].\nThis article extends our previous work which detailed: (1) synthetic protocol\noptimisation for the fabrication of RG-AAEMs, and (2) their chemical, structural, and\nthermoanalytical characterisation [26,27]. The conductivities of such AAEMs are now\nreported and are related to the initial grafting yields, ion-exchange capacities, and\nwater contents.\n72. Experimental\n2.1. Synthesis of alkaline anion-exchange membranes\nThe synthetic protocol for the anion-exchange membranes is described in detail in\nreference [27] and will only be summarised here. Reverse osmosis (RO) water was\nused throughout this study. Table 1 summarises the experimental conditions used to\nproduce the FEP-g-PVBC intermediate membranes. The FEP films were irradiated\nwith a 60Co \t-ray source (Royal Military College of Science, Cranfield University,\nShrivenham, Swindon, UK) at a temperature of 23 \u00b1 1\u00b0C and with a dose rate of 0.04\nMRad h-1 (0.4 kGy) and stored at \u201337 \u00b1 3\u00b0C until required. VBC (Dow Chemicals,\n97%, m\/p ratio = 1.30, stabilised with 75 ppm 4-tert-butylcatechol and 733 ppm\nnitromethane, 192 ppm residual water content) was stored in a refrigerator and used\nundiluted as the grafting monomer after being purged with nitrogen for 2 h. The\ndegree of grafting (d.o.g., %) of the FEP-g-PVBC membranes were calculated as\nfollows:\n100\u00d7\n\u000b\n=\ni\nig\nm\nmm\n.g.o.d (1)\nwhere mg is the grafted mass and mi is the initial mass of the irradiated FEP films. The\nFEP-g-PVBC intermediate membranes were subsequently submerged in aqueous\ntrimethylamine (Acros, 50%wt) for 48 h. After washing several times in water the\nresulting hydrophilic membranes (now as chloride-forms) were boiled in water for 1 h\n(to remove residual trimethylamine and to fully hydrate the membranes) and finally\nwashed in water several more times. Conversion to the alkaline-forms was conducted\nas follows: the membranes were submerged in aqueous potassium hydroxide (Fisher\n8Scientific, 1.0 mol dm-3, at least 10 times excess) for 48 h with two changes of\npotassium hydroxide solution during this period to ensure complete ion-exchange\n(important to obtain maximum ion-exchange capacities). The resulting AAEMs were\nthen soaked in water for two days with at least two changes of water to remove any\nlingering potassium hydroxide species. The final AAEMs (\u201cas-synthesised\u201d) were\nstored in water until required and were not allowed to dry out at any point before\nmeasurements were conducted.\n2.2. Determination of ion-exchange capacities (IECs)\nStandard aqueous solutions of potassium hydroxide (Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn, 0.1000 \u00b1 0.0001\nmol dm-3) and hydrochloric acid (Aldrich, 0.0990 \u00b1 0.0001 mol dm-3) for IEC\ndetermination were used as received; all aqueous potassium hydroxide standards were\nreplaced regularly to reduce the build of carbonate and prevent inaccuracies in the\ntitrations.\nThe IECs (all IECs referred to in this paper are the strong anion-exchange capacities,\ni.e. OH- ion content per g of polymer) were determined as follows. The AAEMs were\nimmersed in 20.00 \u00b1 0.03 cm3 (calibrated Class A pipette) of hydrochloric acid\nstandard solution for 48 h. The solutions were then back titrated with potassium\nhydroxide standard solution using a Metrohm 716 DMS Titrino. The titrations were\nconducted dynamically with a minimum addition of potassium hydroxide titrant of\n0.002 cm3 (\u00b1 0.002 cm3 was taken as the volume error of the burette) and a maximum\nrate of addition of titrant of 0.5 cm3 min-1. The endpoints were determined from\nlargest maxima in the differential, d(pH)\/dVtitrant, titration curves (Figure 1 shows a\n9typical example). Three replicates were recorded for each membrane, and a blank run\nconsisting of 20 cm3 of hydrochloric acid (aq, 0.1 mol dm-3) with no membrane was\nrun alongside each batch to confirm the precision and accuracy of the titrations (a\ncoefficient of variation of < 0.2% was found for all blank runs). The amount of\nhydroxide anions in the membrane was calculated from the difference between the\ninitial amount of hydrochloric acid in which the membranes were soaked and the\namount of hydrochloric acid titrand remaining after as determined from the titration.\nThe membrane samples were then washed in water and soaked in excess potassium\nhydroxide (aq, 1 mol dm-3) for > 48 h with two changes of potassium hydroxide\nsolution for complete ion-exchange to the alkaline forms. After being soaked in water\nfor > 48 h (with at least two changes of water) the regenerated AAEMs were dried in\na desiccator over anhydrous calcium chloride for > 1 week (relative humidity (RH) =\n0%). It was determined experimentally that this drying protocol gave the same level\nof drying as treatment in a vacuum oven at 80\u00b0C for 4 h; this low temperature method\nwas adopted for this characterization as it avoids elevated temperatures for elongated\nperiods of time, which could potentially cause AAEM degradation. The ion-exchange\ncapacities (IEC \/ eq g-1) reported were calculated as below:\n( ) ( )\n( )\u000b\n++ \u000b\n=\nOHm\nHnHn\nIEC\ndry\nfi (2)\nwhere ni(H+) is the amount of acid the membrane was soaked in, nf(H+) is the amount\nof acid remaining as determined by the titration, and mdry(OH-) is the mass of the\ndried regenerated AAEMs. [Note: the IECs in our previous synthetic studies [26,27]\nrelated to the IECs of the chloride-form anion-exchange membranes; the IECs in this\nstudy relate to the alkaline-form membranes to allow easier comparison with future\nfuel cell tests.]\n10\n2.3. Water uptake experiments\nThe AAEMs membranes \u201cas-synthesised\u201d were first weighed (surface water was\nremoved by careful and quick blotting with tissue paper) to determine the hydrated\nmass. The samples were then dried at RH = 0% (as for IEC determination\nexperiments) for > 1 week at ambient temperature. The dried masses were recorded\nand the water uptake (%) was calculated:\n100\u00d7\n\u000b\n=\ndry\ndryhyd\nm\nmm\nWU (3)\nwhere mhyd is the hydrated mass of the \u201cas-synthesised\u201d AAEMs and mdry is the dry\nmass. The water uptakes were calculated as the average of three replicate membrane\nsamples for each AAEM. The average number of water molecules per ~NMe3+ anion-\nexchange site, \u000f, were then calculated as follows:\n01518100 .IEC\nWU\n\u00d7\u00d7\n=\u000f (4)\nwhere 18.015 g mol-1 was taken as the molecular weight of water.\n2.4. Membrane thicknesses (swelling)\nDuring water uptake experiments, the thicknesses of the AAEMs were measured.\nThicknesses (an average of four measurements for each of the three replicate\nmembrane samples for each AAEM, twelve measurements in total) were measured for\nthe hydrated membranes \u201cas synthesised\u201d and for the dried membranes (RH = 0%, 1\nweek). The thicknesses were recorded using an external micrometer (precision of \u00b1 2\n\u00b5m).\n11\n2.5. Conductivity measurements (via impedance spectroscopy)\nThe method for measuring the conductivities followed the impedance spectroscopy\napproach recently reported by Pozio et al. [28,29]. Impedance spectra were recorded\nwith a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyser \/ 1287 electrochemical interface\ncombination controlled by ZPlot v.1 software (Scribner Associates) with data analysis\nof the Nyquist plots (Zim vs Zreal from the vector (in the complex plane), Z(\u0011) = R +\nj\u0012, where the resistance R = Zreal, the reactance \u0012 = Zim, \u0011 = 2\u0013f (f is the frequency of\nthe applied a.c. voltage), and j = 1\u000b ) was conducted using Zview v.2 software\n(Scribner Associates). This reported method is more suitable for thin and highly\nconductive membranes than the copper disk \/ silver dag method and cell design used\npreviously at Surrey for thicker siloxane-based ionomer pellets [30].\nThe alkaline AAEM membranes to be tested (cut to circular diameter = 1.39 cm) were\npressed between two single-sided carbon-powder-coated carbon cloth electrodes (E-\nTek: A-6 ELAT\/SS\/NC\/V2, carbon only - no metal catalyst, thickness = 355 \u00b5m,\ncircular diameter = 1.13 \u00b1 0.02 cm, (area 1.00 \u00b1 0.04 cm2) with the powder side\npressed to the membrane) at 500 \u00b1 50 kg cm-2 at 100\u00b0C for 5 min. This temperature\nfollowed the AAEM MEA preparation methodology used by Scott et al. for fuel cell\nmeasurements [12]. After pressing, the resulting membrane electrode assemblies\n(MEAs) were stored in water for at least two days prior to conductivity\nmeasurements. The cell design, with circular graphite plates, was similar to that\nreported by Pozio [28], the only difference being that ELAT A-6 carbon cloth\nelectrodes were used instead of Toray carbon paper. The cell assembly was placed in\na beaker of RO water so that all of the MEA was submerged, while the gold jack plug\n12\n(for electrical connection) were kept outside of the water. Impedance measurements\nwere conducted at increasing temperatures in the range 19 \u2013 99\u00b0C (error of \u00b1 1\u00b0C) by\ncontrolling the temperature of the water using a hotplate stirrer. Spectra were recorded\nat each temperature, after at least a 15 min delay to allow thermal equilibration, for f =\n100 Hz \u2013 1 MHz and with 50 mV root mean squared (rms) voltage perturbation, 0.1 s\nintegration time, and 0.1 s delay time (delay between signal application and\ncommencement of measurements at each frequency). Rtot (the sum of the membrane,\nRmem, and cell resistance, Rcell) was taken as the intercept with the x-axis.\nRcell was determined by impedance measurements for a blank cell containing two\nELAT A-6 electrodes pressed together in an identical manner to that described above\n(no membrane therefore forming an electrical short circuit). Impedance measurements\nat each temperature were conducted for f = 10 Hz \u2013 1 kHz and with 50 mV rms\nvoltage perturbation, 0.5 s integration time, and 0.5 s delay time. Rcell was taken as the\nintercept with the x-axis.\nCommercial Nafion\u00ae-115 (N115) proton-exchange membrane (fully hydrated\nthickness determined to be 140 \u00b1 9 \u00b5m) was used as a benchmark. N115 MEAs were\nprepared in a similar manner to that above, with the following slight modifications:\nthe MEAs were pressed at 135\u00b0C for 5 min instead of 100\u00b0C and the MEAs were\nboiled in water for 2 h after preparation to ensure the expanded form of N115 was\nreformed after the hot pressing [28] (no delamination of the MEAs was observed in\nthis boiling step). The N115 MEAs were then stored in water until required for\nimpedance spectroscopy. Impedance measurements with N115 MEAs were conducted\n13\nfor f = 10 kHz \u2013 1 MHz and with 50 mV rms voltage perturbation, 0.1 s integration\ntime, and 0.1 s delay time. Rtot was taken as the intercept with the x-axis.\nFigure 2 shows sample spectra obtained with a blank cell, a sample N115 MEA and a\nsample AAEM 1 MEA. The precision of the resistance readings (intercept on x-axis)\nfor the N115 MEAs and the AAEM MEAs with this equipment and cell setup was\nestimated to be \u00b1 0.005 \u0014 (from multiple impedance scans on selected MEAs at room\ntemperature). For the blank cell impedance measurements, the error was \u00b1 0.001 \u0014\n(electronic conduction with no ion conduction lead to higher precision {see the scale\non the inset in Figure 2} with this cell set up, again based on multiple scans on the\nblank cell at room temperature).\nConductivities, \u0001 \/ S cm-1, are calculated as below:\nAR\nl\nmem \u00d7\n=\u0001 (5)\nwhere l is the membrane thickness in cm, A is the electrode area in cm2 and Rmem is\nthe membrane resistance in \u0014 calculated from Rtot \u2013 Rcell. The activation energies, Ea \/\nkJ mol-1, are calculated assuming Arrehnius behaviour (see results section for a\ncomment on this) and the slope, b, of the linear regression of ln (\u0001 \/ S cm-1) vs (1000 \/\nT) \/ K-1 plots:\nRbEa \u00d7\u000b= (6)\nwhere R is the gas constant 8.314472148 J K-1 mol-1 and the axes are plotted exactly\nas described above.\n14\n2.6. Statistical analysis\nA consistent treatment of the precision of the measurements has been conducted. All\nerrors are determined from sample standard deviations. Any confidence intervals\nmentioned in the text are at the 95% confidence level, based on the sample deviations\nand using the relevant student-t distribution (N-1 degrees of freedom, N is the number\nof samples tested for each membrane). The sample standard deviations over multiple\nsamples for each membrane are compared to the expected calculated errors calculated\nfrom the standard deviations of the indeterminate errors of each physical\nmeasurement, termed the calculated indeterminate error (CIE) (see the Appendix for\nan example involving the calculation of the CIE for a conductivity). For the empirical\nactivation energies of ion migration, Ea, the sample standard deviations over multiple\nsamples of each membrane are compared to the errors calculated from the standard\nerror of the slope of the linear regression (abbreviated to ESLR) calculated using\nSigmaPlot v8 graphing and statistical analysis software. If the standard deviation over\nmultiple sample from each membrane is larger than the expected CIE or the ESLR,\nthis suggests that there is variability in the measured results between the samples from\neach membrane (i.e. heterogeneity in the radiation-grafted AAEMs); full discussions\nof this can be found in the results and discussion section where it is required. The\nerror bars presented on graphs are defined in the relevant figure captions.\n15\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. The conductivity of fully hydrated Nafion\u00ae-115 (N115) as benchmark\nFigure 3 shows the measured conductivities of 3 samples of N115 membrane as a\nfunction of temperature; Figure 4 shows the ln (\u0001 \/ S cm-1) vs (1000 \/ T) \/ K-1 \nrepresentation of the same data. Table 2 gives the empirical values of \u0001 at 50 \u00b1 1\u00b0C\nand Ea for each sample of N115 membrane. The average conductivity at 50 \u00b1 1\u00b0C\nover the three samples (arithmetic mean) is 0.104 \u00b1 0.008 S cm-1 (Table 5). As the\nsample standard deviation over the three samples is the same magnitude as the CIEs,\nthere is no significant variability between the MEAs of each sample of N115 when\nmeasuring the conductivities using this method and cell setup. The conductivity\nvalues obtained are much larger that those obtained by Pozio et al. for N115 (\u0001 =\n0.045 \u00b1 0.004 S cm-1 at 65\u00b0C) [28]. This can be explained by the fact that in this study\nthe N115 MEAs were boiled for 2 h in water to reproduce the fully hydrated\nexpanded form after hot-pressing and that the membrane thickness was taken as 140 \u00b1\n9 \u00b5m. In contrast, Pozio et al. took the membrane thickness to be the nominal value of\n127 \u00b5m and only soaked the N115 MEAs in water after hot pressing (\u000f = 10), which,\nas stated by these authors, would not fully hydrate the N115 membrane to the\nexpanded E-form with a restored hydrophilic cluster structure. However, the values of\nconductivities obtained in this study for N115 correlate well with values for fully\nhydrated (\u000f = 22 \u2013 23) Nafion\u00ae membranes obtained from previous studies using\ndifferent normal and tangential methods as reviewed in Tables 1 and 2 in Reference\n[28].\n16\nThe mean value for Ea was 6.0 \u00b1 0.8 kJ mol-1 (Table 5), which is smaller than the 7.9\n\u00b1 0.1 kJ mol-1 reported by Pozio et al., suggesting that proton migrations in the N115\nmembranes used as benchmarks in this study were slightly less sensitive to\ntemperature variations, possibly due to the higher level of hydration and restored ionic\ncluster structure.\nIn summary, this method for measuring the conductivities and activation energies of\nion migration in thin conductive membranes gives only small deviations between\nsamples of the same membrane. This method is a simple, quick, and accurate method\nfor comparing the ion conductivities of different membranes. It will be especially\nsuitable for AAEMs, as the initial studies by Scott et al. [11] suggest that area\nresistances of AAEMs are 600% than those of Nafion\u00ae membranes; the estimated\nlargest indeterminate error is incurred when recording Rmem (a constant error of \u00b1\n0.005 \u0014 due to inductance interferences when using the experimental setup described\nin the previous section), and higher resistance membranes will therefore produce a\nsmaller relative error in the measured conductivities. The above was confirmed by an\ninitial feasibility experiment on a single sample of AAEM 1 where a conductivity of\n0.0192 \u00b1 0.0007 S cm-1 (CIE) was recorded at 50 \u00b1 1\u00b0C (Figure 3 and Table 4); this\nsuggested further detailed investigations were justified.\n3.2. Physical characterisation of the AAEMs\nTable 3 summarised the non-electrochemical properties of the AAEMs used in this\nstudy. AAEMs synthesised from 50 \u00b5m FEP starting film showed no variation (within\nexperimental precision) in the dry (RH = 0%, 1 week) and fully hydrated thicknesses,\n17\nwhich were found to be 65 \u00b1 2 \u00b5m and 85 \u00b1 2 \u00b5m respectively. These thicknesses\nreduced to 36 \u00b1 2 \u00b5m and 45 \u00b1 2 \u00b5m respectively for the AAEM derived from 25 \u00b5m\nFEP starting film. The hydration level, \u000f, was also constant across the AAEMS\n(within experimental precision) at 28 \u00b1 2. The number of water molecules per\nexchange-site in the AAEMs were higher than the values found for fully expanded\nNafion\u00ae (\u000f = 22 \u2013 23 [28]), which may indicate that more water molecules can be\nstrongly bound (inner or outer sphere) to the larger OH- anions compared with the\nsmaller (but higher charge density) H+ cations in Nafion\u00ae. Another plausible\nexplanation relates to the more open polymer structure expected for the AAEMs,\ncompared with the ionic cluster model for Nafion\u00ae, allowing more water molecules to\nbe accommodated; the shorter side chains in the AAEMs and the more homogeneous\ndistribution (continous graft penetration throughout the AAEMs [27]) and higher\nconcentration (see IECs later) of the ionic exchange sites in the hydrophobic\nfluorinated medium cluster are not expected to yield such a constricted ionic cluster\nstructure. As such, it is anticipated that the AAEMs can be fully hydrated when\nsoaked in water at room temperature for a few days in contrast to the requirement for\nboiling for 2 h to obtain fully hydrated Nafion\u00ae [28]. This is important because\nAAEMs based on bound quaternary ammonium cation sites with OH- anions show\nchemical instability when treated at temperatures above 60\u00b0C for extended periods of\ntime (see Scheme 3 in Reference [6] for degradation mechanisms); this is why the\nAAEM MEAs for conductivity measurements were not boiled in water (the hot-\npressing at 100\u00b0C was only for a very short period of time and was assumed to have a\nminimal impact on the polymer structure and IECs).\n18\nFigure 5 graphically compares the calculated and experimentally determined IECs\n(Table 3). The IECs are lower than expected from the synthetic methodology, even to\nthe 95% confidence level (error bars). There are three potential reasons for this:\n(1) Displacement of the quaternary ammonium cation-exchange sites, especially\non extended treatment in aqueous potassium hydroxide (1 mol dm-3) for 48 h,\nto effect the ion-exchange to the alkaline forms.\n(2) Incomplete amination on treatment of the FEP-g-PVBC in aqueous\ntrimethylamine (50%mass) for 48 h.\n(3) Trapped poly(VBC) homopolymer (oligomeric or polymeric) in the\nintermediate FEP-g-PVBC membranes, which contributes to the determination\nof the d.o.g. but is subsequently being released on amination and anion-\nexchange membrane swelling (boiling step with chloride ion forms).\nEvidence for (1) above is the slight trimethylamine smell on drying the AAEMs (RH\n= 0%, 1 week) and after membrane treatment in potassium hydroxide (1 mol dm-3, 48\nh). Evidence for (3) above is that the experimentally determined IECs for the AAEM\nbased on 25 \u00b5m FEP is 92% of expected IEC compared with 84 \u2013 87 % for the\nAAEMs based on 50 \u00b5m FEP; this signifies that a smaller amount of trapped\npoly(VBC) homopolymer is present in, and easier to escape from, the thinner\nmembranes. It has been previously observed that there is no increase in IEC when\nincreasing the amination times above 24 h [27]; it is therefore accepted that the 48 h\namination times used in this study will produce near 100% amination, and that reason\n(2) above is not a significant factor in the lower-than-expected experimentally\ndetermined IECs. The IEC of N115 was calculated to be 0.93 \u00b1 0.01 meq g-1 from the\nreported equivalent weights = 1075 \u00b1 15 g mol-1 [28].\n19\n3.3. Conductivities of AAEMs\nConductivities at 50 \u00b1 1\u00b0C were chosen as benchmarks for comparing AAEM;\ntemperatures above 60\u00b0C lead to AAEM degradation and 50\u00b0C was selected on the\nbasis of a practical temperature for operation of fuel cells with AAEMs (high\ntemperatures would be inadvisable in power supplies for portable devices such as\nlaptop computers). Figure 6 shows the conductivities for the AAEMs as a function of\ntemperature, with the values of \u0001 at 50 \u00b1 1\u00b0C summarized in Table 4 and 5. The\nspread of determined values for the conductivities, at all temperatures, between\nsamples of the same AAEM are larger than the CIEs, indicating that the AAEMs\nexhibit a degree of grafting heterogeneity; this confirms IEC measurements in which\nthe spread of experimentally determined IECs is larger than the CIEs (not reported).\nThis demonstrates a possible requirement for more optimization work on the synthetic\nprotocol to improve the homogeneity resulting from the radiation-grafting procedure\nand to yield AAEMs that exhibit homogeneous conductivities.\nThe values of \u0001 at 50 \u00b1 1\u00b0C do not increase with d.o.g in the range 21 \u2013 26% (within\nthe experimental uncertainties as indicated by the sample standard deviations about\nthe mean values). Grafting levels below 21% clearly lead to undesirable decreases in\nconductivities for the final AAEMs. Grafting levels > 26% are not possible with this\nsynthetic pre-irradiation grafting protocol as total doses > 7 Mrad (70 kGy) of \t-\nirradiation would be required and are known to lead to AAEM membrane brittleness\n(very undesirable for use as fuel cell fuel\/oxidant gas separation and ion-conductive\nmembranes); this limitation is mainly down to the choice FEP base polymer [19].\nViable solutions to overcome this limitation are summarized below:\n20\n(1) A switch to the simultaneous irradiation methodology (where the FEP would\nbe irradiated while soaked in the VBC monomer) as this requires lower\nradiation doses for enhanced grafting yields.\n(2) Substitution of FEP with a base polymer that exhibits superior radiation\ntolerance. This is the case with non-fluorinated LDPE and this is under active\ninvestigation, with results to be published in due course.\n(3) The use of a polymer system that does not involve irradiative techniques to\nproduce AAEM functionality.\nThe maximum mean value of conductivity of 0.023 \u00b1 0.001 S cm-1 (AAEM 2) at 50 \u00b1\n1\u00b0C is 20% of that found for fully hydrated N115 (0.104 \u00b1 0.008 S cm-1); however,\nabsolute membrane resistances will be lower than this suggests as the AAEMs\nproduced in this study are thinner than fully hydrated N115 (85 and 45 \u00b5m compared\nwith 140 \u00b5m). Significantly, the conductivities for the AAEMs are only 50% of the\nvalue of 0.045 \u00b1 0.004 S cm-1 at 65\u00b0C as determined by Pozio et al., who used the\nnominal thickness of 127 \u00b5m for N115 in the calculation of the conductivity and did\nnot boil the MEAs after hot pressing (boiling the MEAs in water is not always\nundertaken when preparing fuel cell MEAs), indicated by their determined \u000f = 10 (c.f.\n\u000f = 23 for fully hydrated Nafion\u00ae). This clearly indicates the suitability of the\nAAEMs produced for this study fors application as alkaline fuel cell membranes. Due\nto the increased sensitivity towards increasing temperature (see discussions on\nactivation energies below), conductivities around 90\u00b0C for the AAEMs are only 33%\nthat found for fully hydrated N115; the AAEMs will not, however have long term\nthermal stability in this temperature regime.\n21\nThe empirical activation energies for ion-migration, Ea, for the AAEMs are presented\nin Tables 4 and 5 and were determined from the linear regression of plots presented in\nFigure 7. There is some variation between the values for Ea found between samples of\nthe same AAEM (the spread of values obtained between samples of the same AAEM\nis larger than the CIEs), corroborating conductivity and IEC trends. However, the\nmean values of Ea do not vary significantly between AAEMs (confidence limit of\n12.6 \u00b1 0.6 kJ mol-1 at the 95% confidence level over all twelve samples studies for\nAAEMs 2 \u2013 5). This value is twice that found with fully hydrated N115 in this study\n(6.0 \u00b1 0.8 kJ mol-1) and more than the value of 7.9 \u00b1 0.1 kJ mol-1 determined by Pozio\net al. for N115 [28]. This demonstrates that hydroxide ion mobility in these RG-\nAAEMs is significantly more sensitive to temperature than proton migration in N115,\nbut interestingly only slightly more sensitive than proton-migration in thicker\nNafion\u00ae-117 (nominal thickness of 183 \u00b5m, Ea = 10.9 \u00b1 0.2 kJ mol-1 [28])\nA critical examination of the linear regressions in Figure 7 (R2 = 0.995 \u00b1 0.002 over\nall twelve samples studied for AAEMs 2 \u2013 5) show a consistent and perceptible\nlowering of the conductivities at temperatures > 65\u00b0C when compared to the values\nexpected if pure Arrhenius behaviour was observed (the gradient of decrease slopes\nlower slightly at higher temperatures). This is evidence of either (1) a limitation in the\nassumption of Arrhenius behaviour, (2) the presence of AAEM degradation (which is\nexpected from the functional group chemistry as explained above), or (3) a change in\nhydration at elevated temperatures for the AAEMs. The behaviour is likely to result\nfrom a combination of all three. The Ea values given in this text should only be\nconsidered as an empirical indication of the temperature sensitivity of hydroxide ion\nmobility in the AAEMs.\n22\n4. Conclusions\nA maximum conductivity of 0.023 \u00b1 0.001 S cm-1 at 50 \u00b1 1\u00b0C was demonstrated for\nthe radiation-grafted AAEMs studied (\u000f = 28 \u00b1 2 water molecules per ion-exchange\nsite) and was found to be between 20 \u2013 50% of the values determined for Nafion\u00ae-115\n(\u0001 = 0.045  \u00b1 0.004 (65\u00b0C) \u2013 0.104 \u00b1 0.008 (50 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) S cm-1, depending on the level\nof hydration (\u000f = 10 and 23 respectively)). The AAEMs produced are, however,\nthinner (45 \u2013 85 \u00b5m) compared with N115 (127 \u2013 140 \u00b5m) and so the absolute\nresistances of the membranes are close to those found for N115. AAEMs with initial\nd.o.g. > 21% do not show a perceptible variation in conductivity at 50 \u00b1 1\u00b0C;\nhowever, conductivity does decrease on d.o.g. < 21%. This significant result clearly\nindicates the suitability of these AAEMs for application in fuel cells below the\naccepted thermal stability limitation of 60\u00b0C for alkaline membranes based on a\nquaternary ammonium functionality. In-depth statistical analysis of the of the ion-\nexchange capacity and conductivity variations for the AAEMs indicate that there is\nsome heterogeneity resulting from radiation-grafting synthetic procedure. The\nempirical activation energies (Arrhenius behaviour assumed) for hydroxide ion\nmobility in the AAEMs (12.6 \u00b1 0.6 kJ mol-1 at the 95% confidence level) is twice that\nfor proton mobility in fully hydrated N115 (6.0 \u00b1 0.8 kJ mol-1), showing that\nhydroxide ion migration has a stronger temperature dependence.\n23\nAcknowledgments\nWe gratefully thank the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council for\nfunding (Grant GR\/S60709\/01) and Keith Lovell of RMCS (Shrivenham), Cranfield\nUniversity for irradiation of FEP films and for useful discussions.\nAppendix\nThe calculated indeterminate errors (CIEs) are calculated using standard rules from\nthe indeterminate errors (precision) of each of the physical measurements.
