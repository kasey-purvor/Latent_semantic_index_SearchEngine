Studies in Norway on the occurrence of  \nFusarium spp. in cereal grain (Kosiak et al., 1997 and Langseth and Rundberget, 1999) led to  \nthe description of a new \u201cpowdery Fusarium poae\u201d isolate which produced the mycotoxins T-2  \nand HT-2 (Torp and Langseth, 1999). This led to the description of a new species Fusarium  \nlangsethiae (Torp and Nirenberg, 2004). This species produces type A trichothecenes,  \nespecially the highly toxic T-2 and HT-2 toxins, and diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) (Thrane et al.,  \n2004).   \n T-2 toxin, the most toxic Type A trichothecene, is a potent inhibitor of DNA, RNA and  \nprotein synthesis, and shows immunosuppressive and cytotoxic effects both in vitro and in vivo  \n(Visconti, 2001 and Canady et al., 2001). Data collected to evaluate the risk of dietary exposure  \nto Fusarium toxins by the populations of EU member states showed that T-2 and HT-2 toxins  \nare quite common contaminants in cereals in the EU (Schothorst and van Egmond, 2004). F.  \nlangsethiae has been implicated in the occurrence of these toxins in surveys of cereals in  \ntemperate\/cool regions such as Norway (Langseth and Rundberget, 1999) and in oats in the UK  \n(Edwards, 2007).   \n F. langsethiae has been isolated from infected oats, wheat and barley in central and  \nnorthern Europe (Torp and Adler, 2004; Torp and Nirenberg 2004 and Hudec and Roh\u00e1cik,  \n2009). One problem is that this species can be readily isolated from small-grain cereals from  \nsymptomless oats and wheat grains. Its pathogenicity on these cereals has been demonstrated  \nrecently (Imathiu et al., 2009). Indeed, a Real-time PCR system has been developed to try to  \naid the detection of this species in Swedish oats (Fredlund et al., 2010).  \n At present there is no information on whether infection by this species may be  \nimportant predominantly pre-harvest or whether poor post-harvest storage enables growth  \nand contamination with T-2 and HT-2 toxins. This is important as the EU is considering setting  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n4 \n \nlegislative limits for contamination of cereals with the combined total of the two toxins. There  \nis no detailed knowledge on the ecology of F. langsethiae and whether strains from different  \nnorthern European countries respond to changes in interacting environmental factors in a  \nsimilar manner or differently.   \n The objectives of this study were to compare the effect of the key ecological  \nparameters of aw and temperature and their interactions on (a) lag times prior to growth, (b)  \nminimum and optimum conditions for growth and (c) develop two dimensional contour maps  \nof the profiles for growth of two strains each of F. langsethiae from the UK, Norway, Sweden  \nand Finland on an oat-based medium. Statistical comparisons were also made to identify intra-  \nand inter-strain similarities and differences.   \n  \n2. Material and methods  \n2.1 Strains  \nEight F. langsethiae strains from different origins were used. These were: U.K. (strains  \n2004\/57, 2004\/59); Norway (44P, 88E); Finland (05010, 05014) and Sweden (560, 562). These  \nstrains are available via the Culture Collections of Harper Adams University College, UK;  \nAgricultural University As, Norway; Finnish Food Safety Authority (Evira, Helsinki, Finland);  \nSwedish Food Authority, Uppsala, Sweden.   \n  \n2.2 Medium preparation and inoculation    \nMilled whole oats were prepared by milling for 5 mins in a Waring Laboratory Science blender  \nmodel 7009G (Waring Laboratory Science, CT, USA).  Mixtures of 2% (w\/v) oat flour in water  \nwere prepared and 2% (w\/v) agar (Technical agar No. 2, Oxoid) added. Water used to prepare  \nthe medium was modified with glycerol to the required aw levels (0.995, 0.98, 0.95, 0.93, 0.90  \nand 0.88). The culture media were autoclaved for 20 minutes at 121 oC. The molten media  \nwere vigorously shaken and poured into 9 cm Petri dishes (15 ml per plate). The final pH in all  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n5 \n \nmedia was 6.2. In all cases 7 day old cultures were used to inoculate the different aw x  \ntemperature treatments. For inoculation of each strain of F. langsethiae agar discs (4 mm  \ndiameter) were taken from the margin of the growing colonies and placed in the centre of the  \ntreatment Petri plates. These were incubated at different temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30,  \n37oC) for 10 days. All experiments were carried out with three replicates per treatment and  \nrepeated twice.   \n  \n2.3 Calculation of lag phases and mycelial growth rates  \n  \nPrimary modelling was carried out on the colony radii data. In general, data plots showed,  \nafter a lag phase, a linear trend with time. Only in a few cases were the curves asymptotic. Due  \nto this, data was fitted using the Baranyi biphasic model (Baranyi et al., 1993 and Baranyi and  \nRoberts, 1994) and a linear model obtained by plotting the results against time. The linear  \nparts were used. From these primary models the maximum lag phases (\u03bb) and growth rates  \n(\u03bcm) were obtained.   \n  \n2.4 Statistical analysis and profiling  \nStatistical analysis was performed using the package JMP\u00ae 8 (SAS Institute Inc., 2008. Cary, NC,  \nUSA) and STATISTICA 8 (StatSoft\u00ae Inc., 2007. Tulsa, OK, USA). Only cases where growth actually  \noccurred during the 10 day incubation period were used in the statistical analysis. Data on  \nrelative growth rates obtained from the different primary models were tested for normality  \nusing the Shapiro-Wilk test. Due to non-normality of the data, growth rate data was  \ntransformed using log10(x). Homoscedasticity was checked using Levene\u2019s and Brown- \nForsythe\u2019s tests. Finally, prior to analysis possible outliers were identified using Mahalanobis  \ndistances test. Subsequently, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was applied in order to find  \ndifferences between origin of strains, temperatures, water availabilities and strains. The  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n6 \n \nTukey-Kramer significant difference (Tukey-Kramer HSD) multiple range test at 95% confidence  \nlevel was used to group the cases into homogeneous groups with regard to the different  \nparameters used. T-tests were used in order to compare intra-strain differences. Contour  \nmaps were developed using Sigma Plot v.10.0 (Systat Software Inc. Hounslow, London, UK).  \n  \n3. Results  \n3.1. Initial primary modelling  \nTwo different models were considered initially and growth curves were fitted using the Baranyi  \nbiphasic model and a linear model obtained by plotting the results against time. Results  \nobtained by both approaches were very similar and based on the studies of Marin et al. (2008)  \nthe Baranyi biphasic model was selected to analyse all the experimental data because this  \nminimised subjectivity in the calculation of the lag phase (\u03bb) and growth rate (\u03bcm).  \n3.2. Effect of water activity and temperature on lag phases prior to growth  \nGenerally, the lag phase increased when temperature and aw stress were imposed in the oat- \nbased culture media (Table 1). Both temperature (p=<0.0001) and water availability  \n(p=<0.0002) had significant effects on the lag phases prior to growth (Table 2). These data are  \nmeans for two strains although in some cases one of the two strains did not grow at 0.93 aw. At  \nthis marginal aw level and under some temperatures the lag times were >10 days, which was  \nthe maximum experimental period used in this study.   \n  \n  \n3.3. Comparison of effects of water activity and temperature on mycelia growth of F.  \nlangsethiae strains   \n  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n7 \n \nFigure 1 shows the effect of aw at different temperatures on the mean growth of two strains  \neach from the four different countries. This shows that in all cases strains grew best at 20-25oC  \nat 0.98-0.995 aw. After 10 days, only strains from Finland, Norway and Sweden were able to  \ngrow at 0.93 aw with no growth being observed at 0.90 aw regardless of the temperature. No  \ngrowth was also observed at 37oC during the experimental periods of this study. Statistical  \nanalyses (ANOVA) of the relative growth rates showed that there was no significant intra- and  \ninter-strain differences, although overall, temperature (p=0.0009) and aw (p=<0.0001) were  \nstatistically significant environmental factors (Table 3).   \n Using the Tukey-Kramer HSD test at 95% confidence levels, the treatments were  \ngrouped into homogeneous groups with regard to these two parameters. The aw level  \nprovided three different non-overlapping clusters. In the first cluster 0.995 and 0.98 aw were  \ngrouped together confirming that highest growth rates occur at these aw levels. The other  \nwater availabilities were placed in two different groups corresponding to 0.95 and 0.93 aw.  \n Analyses of the temperature effects provided two different overlapping clusters. The  \nfirst cluster was composed of 15 to 25oC and the second cluster included 30, 10, 15 and 20oC.  \nThus only significant differences were observed between 30 and 10 with 25oC . These results  \nconfirmed the faster growth was observed in warmer temperatures. Possible intra-strain  \ndifferences were examined using T-test analysis. For each of the four pairs of strains there  \nwere no significant differences (In all cases t> 0.18). The most marked differences were  \nobserved between the two Swedish strains.  \n  \n  \n3.4. Two dimensional contour maps of growth profiles of F. langsethiae in relation to  \ntemperature and water activity  \n  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n8 \n \nThe conditions under which equivalent growth rates occurred under different environmental  \nconditions were joined to produce contour lines to map the relative optimum and marginal  \nconditions for growth of the F. langsethiae strains from each country examined. Figure 2  \ncompares these profiles by country of origin, based on the mean data for two strains in each  \ncase. It should be noted that in these studies no growth occurred at 37oC and thus growth may  \nbe limited to temperatures of <35oC. These contour maps show that optimum conditions for  \nall strains, regardless of origin, is around 25oC at >0.98 aw. Growth rates were in the range 4.5- \n5.0 mm day-1. Marginal conditions for growth are over a wider temperature range and approx.  \nlimited at about 0.93-0.92 aw. For comparison, 0.98 aw represents about 28-30% moisture  \ncontent in oat grains at 15-25oC (wet weight basis) and would be considered to be very wet  \nconditions, while 0.93-0.92 aw is about 23-24% and 0.90 aw approx. 19-21% moisture contents.   \n  \n4. Discussion  \nThis is the first study focused on impact of important environmental factors on the ecology of  \nF. langsethiae. We have analysed strains from four different European countries and the effect  \nof temperature and water availability on the lag phases prior to growth and growth rates on a  \nrelevant oat-based medium. Similarities and differences between strains and between origins  \nwere also taken into account. The contour maps for the effect of interacting conditions of aw x  \ntemperature on optimum and marginal conditions for growth should be very useful in  \ndetermining the risk factors during harvesting and post-harvest management of grain,  \nespecially oats.   \nSince the differentiation between Fusarium sporotrichioides, F. langsethiae and F. poae  \nwas made possible by using molecular means (Wilson et al., 2004 and Yli-Mattila et al., 2004),  \nF. langsethiae has become one of the important fungi to consider regarding T-2 and HT-2  \ncontamination of cereals, especially oats in northern Europe.  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n9 \n \n The present study has shown that environmental factors affect the lag phases (\u03bb) prior  \nto growth.  Other studies  of Fusarium spp. such as F. verticilliodes and F. proliferatum from the  \nsection Liseola have shown that both lag phases prior to growth and mycelial extension were  \nmaximum at marginal conditions such as 0.90-0.92 aw and marginal temperatures (Marin et al  \n1995; Mar\u00edn et al., 1996 and Etcheverry et al., 2002). This is important information as the  \naddition of fungicides or other control systems can then be examined to try and increase this  \nlag phase significantly to minimise the potential for growth and T-2\/HT-2 toxin production  \nunder variable environmental conditions.  \n When the results for water relations of growth of F. langsethiae strains are compared  \nwith data of other Fusarium species, the overall profiles are relatively similar to those for F.  \nculmorum and F. graminearum and perhaps F. avenaceum (Magan and Lacey, 1984). However,  \nF. langsethiae strains appear to be slightly more sensitive to aw than these others. No growth  \nwas observed in the present study at 0.90 aw regardless of strain or temperature. Previous  \nstudies have shown that these aforementioned species were able to grow at 0.90 aw, with  \ngermination occurring at aw conditions of 0.88-0.90 (Magan and Lacey, 1984; Marin et al., 1995  \nand Ramirez et al., 2006).   \n Our data shows that, generally, maximum growth rates were obtained at 25\u00baC. No  \ndifferences were found when statistical comparisons were made for intra and inter-strain  \ndifferences.  Certainly this appears to be a consistent trait. For example, studies with different  \nstrains of F. graminearum have shown optimum growth at 25oC, for F. culmorum and for F.  \npoae,  20-25oC.  The latter species is closely related to F. langsethiae (Cook and Christen, 1976;  \nPettitt et al., 1996; Brennan et al., 2003; Doohan et al., 2003 and Ramirez et al., 2006).   \n Few detailed studies have been carried out to examine the effect of these important  \nenvironmental factors on pathogenicity of F. langsethiae. One recent study has concluded  \nthat, at 5 and 15oC, under \u201cin vitro\u201d conditions, F. langsethiae appears not to be responsible  \nfor Fusarium seedling blight (FSB) in oats and wheat (Imathiu et al., 2010). Although this  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n10 \n \nspecies does not produce any disease symptom in the seeds, molecular studies have shown  \nthat F. langsethiae DNA is present in ripening oats between flowering and harvest (Parikka et  \nal., 2007; Yli-Mattila et al., 2008; Fredlund et al., 2010). Furthermore, good correlations have  \nbeen obtained between total F. langsethiae DNA and the presence of T-2 and HT-2 toxins (Yli- \nMattila et al., 2008; Fredlund et al., 2010).  \n Some studies have suggested that higher contamination with F. langsethiae and T- \n2\/HT-2 toxin has been found in conventional than organically produced oats (Edwards, 2009).  \nDifferences in toxin contamination depending on the origin have been also found. Scudamore  \net al. (2009) in a recent four year study of contamination of oats with T-2\/HT-2 found highest  \ncontamination in samples from the UK and Ireland while levels from Scandinavia were usually  \nlower. Certainly, our studies suggest that there is little difference between strains from  \ndifferent northern European countries in terms ability to grow under interacting extrinsic  \nenvironmental factors.    \n There has been little information on whether growth and toxin production may occur  \nduring damp conditions at harvest or during poor drying. Since oats are often harvested late in  \nthe season damp conditions during harvesting and post-harvest drying and storage can occur.  \nWith the EU considering legislative limits on combined T-2 and HT-2 content in oats and  \nderived products, it is critical to understand and identify high and low risk ecological conditions  \nin relation to colonization by F. langsethiae. Our results show that F. langsethiae species grow  \nbest at temperatures around 25oC and at > 0.98 aw where water is more available.  Studies are  \nnow required to determine the effect of these interacting environmental factors on T-2\/HT-2  \ntoxin production to understand how production profiles compare with those for growth. While  \nthere was little intra and inter-strain differences in growth, we now need knowledge of  \nwhether changes in environmental stress has a similar effect on toxin production by these  \nstrains.   \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n11 \n \n5.
