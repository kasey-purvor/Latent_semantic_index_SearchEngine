From Ramfjord, horizontal neutral winds were measured in the lower and upper thermosphere using \nthe Doppler shift of auroral\/airglow emissions at 557.7 and 630 nm, respectively. The Japanese interferometer \n(Ishii et al., 1997) is a Doppler Imaging System (DIS) (Rees and Greenaway, 1983; Rees et al., 1984) employing a \nwide field of view with 2 detectors. It is capable of estimating Doppler shifts over most of the sky at both \nwavelengths simultaneously. Using the fringe which maps to an elevation angle of ~45o, Doppler shifts for all \nazimuths are combined to produce an equivalent mean horizontal wind approximately every minute. A running \naverage of 5 minutes is used to smooth the result. From Skibotn, thermospheric neutral temperatures were \nmeasured in the local zenith from the Doppler broadening of the same wavelengths using 60 s integration. The \nGerman FPI (Kosch et al., 1997a, 1997b) has a single detector employing a narrrow field of view orientated with a \nsteerable mirror. Due to sequential scanning of the sky (for purposes not presented here) and wavelengths, the \nmeasurement cycle is about 16 minutes. The effective altitude in the lower (557.7 nm) and upper (630 nm) \nthermosphere corresponds to approximately 115 (St\u00f6rmer, 1955) and 240 (Sica et al., 1986; Solomon et al., 1988) \nkm, respectively. The EISCAT incoherent backscatter radar (Rishbeth and van Eyken, 1993) was measuring up the \nlocal magnetic field line in the height range 90 - 580 km during the first part of the first night only. Ion \ntemperatures with 5 minute averaging have been extracted. \n \nMSISE-90 (Hedin, 1991) is a global analytic empirical model of the atmosphere for various geophysical \nconditions, extending from the ground well into the exosphere. Here, average neutral temperatures are extracted. \nHWM-90 (Hedin et al., 1991) is a global analytic empirical model of neutral winds in the atmosphere for various \n  2 \n \ngeophysical conditions, extending from 100 km altitude upwards. CTIP-200 (Fuller-Rowell and Rees, 1980; \nMillward et al., 1996) is a global, 3-dimensional, time-dependant numerical model which simulates the dynamical \nbehaviour of the thermosphere under a wide variety of geophysical conditions. In this study, neutral winds, neutral \ntemperatures and ion temperatures are computed using global energy input estimates based on the 3-hour Kp index \n(Forster et al., 1986). Since this model works in 15 pressure levels spread over 80-450 km, the altitude varies \nslightly throughout the simulation. The spatial resolution is 2o latitude and 18o longitude. \n \n \nFig. 1. Upper thermosphere neutral and ion temperatures for 8-9\/2\/97. The top panel shows neutral temperatures \nfrom the Skibotn FPI at 630 nm (solid curve) and modelling results from MSISE-90 at 240 km (dotted curve) and \nCTIP-200 at ~250 km (dashed curve). The bottom panel shows the same FPI neutral temperatures at 630 nm (solid \ncurve) and ion temperatures from EISCAT averaged over 231-253 km (dotted curve) and the CTIP-200 model at \n~250 km (dashed curve). \n \n \nFig. 2. Lower thermosphere neutral and ion temperatures for 8-9\/2\/97. The top panel shows neutral temperatures \nfrom the Skibotn FPI at 557.7 nm (solid curve) and modelling results from MSISE-90 at 115 km (dotted curve) and \nCTIP-200 at ~115 km (dashed curve). The bottom panel shows the same FPI neutral temperatures at 557.7 nm \n(solid curve) and ion temperatures from EISCAT averaged over 115-121 km (dotted curve) and the CTIP-200 \nmodel at ~115 km (dashed curve). \n \n  3 \n \nReference is made to thermospheric observations at 630 nm by the French Michelson interferometer (MICADO) \n(Thuillier et al., 1990). Observations were made during the solar maximum winters of 1988-1991 in conjunction \nwith EISCAT campaigns from Sodankyl\u00e4, Finland (67.37o N, 26.63o E),  about 390 km from Ramfjord. An \nimportant difference is that we report results from solar minimum. The first night investigated here was \ngeomagnetically disturbed (Kp = 4- - 5o) prior to magnetic midnight (\u2248 21:30 UT) but much quieter thereafter (Kp \n= 2o - 2+). The second night was geomagnetically active throughout (Kp = 4- - 5+), especially around magnetic \nmidnight. \n \nRESULTS \n \nFigure 1 shows the upper thermosphere neutral and ion temperatures for the night of 8-9\/2\/97. The top panel shows \nneutral temperatures from the Skibotn FPI at 630 nm (solid curve), with error bars, and modelling results from \nMSISE-90 at 240 km (dotted curve) and CTIP-200 at ~250 km (dashed curve). Measured and modelled neutral \ntemperatures are in good agreement. The bottom panel shows the same FPI neutral temperatures again (solid curve) \nbut with ion temperatures from EISCAT averaged over 231-253 km (dotted curve) and the CTIP-200 model at \n~250 km (dashed curve). The model is a good approximation of the measured ion temperature given it\u2019s low spatial \nresolution and the low time resolution for energy input when compared to EISCAT\u2019s real time point measurement. \n \n \nFig. 3. Neutral winds for 8-9\/2\/97 in the upper (630 nm) and lower (557.7 nm) thermosphere from the Ramfjord \nFPI measurements (solid curve) and modelling with HWM-90 at 240 and 115 km (dotted curve) and CTIP-200 at \n~250 and ~115 km (dashed curve), respectively. Northward and Eastward are positive. The measured wind error is \n< \u00b1 10 m\/s. \n \nIt is expected that the ion temperature should be greater than or equal to the neutral temperature, the difference \nbeing primarily due to ion heating by ionospheric electric fields (Lockwood et al., 1993). Figure 1 shows this \n  4 \n \nclearly with a large difference prior to 21 UT when Kp = 4- - 5o and much closer agreement after 21 UT when Kp = \n2o - 2+. Unfortunately, no quantitative comparison is possible since EISCAT did not measure electric fields at this \ntime due to a technical fault. Our results are entirely consistent with MICADO (Thuillier et al., 1990). \n \nFigure 2 shows the lower thermosphere neutral and ion temperatures for the night of 8-9\/2\/97. The top panel shows \nneutral temperatures from the Skibotn FPI at 557.7 nm (solid curve), with error bars, and modelling results from \nMSISE-90 at 115 km (dotted curve) and CTIP-200 at ~115 km (dashed curve).  Measured and modelled neutral \ntemperatures are in good agreement. The bottom panel shows the same FPI neutral temperatures again (solid curve) \nbut with ion temperatures from EISCAT averaged over 115-121 km (dotted curve) and the CTIP-200 model at \n~115 km (dashed curve). Again, the model is a good approximation of the measured ion temperature. Given the \nincrease in ion-neutral collision frequency of some 2 orders of magnitude at lower altitudes (Kelley, 1989), the \ndifference between ion and neutral temperatures is expected to be small. The problem with the FPI measurement at \n557.7 nm is the unknown height of the emission which can be very variable in the auroral zone. Figure 2 shows \nneutral and ion temperatures in good agreement, however, neutral temperatures are greater than ion temperatures \nbefore 20 UT and vice versa after 20 UT. A more detailed analysis (not shown) indicates that the emission had an \neffectively height of > 121 km before 20 UT and < 115 km after 20 UT. A hardening of the energy spectrum of the \nprecipitating particles throughout the night in the auroral zone, resulting in a decrease of the emission altitude, is \ngenerally expected (Hardy et al., 1985). \n \nFigure 3 shows the neutral winds for the night of 8-9\/2\/97 in the upper (630 nm) and lower (557.7 nm) \nthermosphere from the Ramfjord FPI measurements (solid curve), with an error of < \u00b1 10 m\/s (Nakajima et al., \n1995), and modelling with HWM-90 at 240 and 115 km (dotted curve) and CTIP-200 at ~250 and ~115 km \n(dashed curve), respectively. The FPI upper thermospheric winds are in general agreement with those of MICADO \n(Fauliot et al., 1993). In the upper thermosphere, HWM-90 does a reasonable prediction of the wind except that the \nmeridional amplitude is too large and the zonal wind has the incorrect direction before ~ 20 UT. MICADO \nobservations agreed well with HWM-90 meridional winds but they also found HWM-90 zonal winds often \nreversed (Lilensten et al., 1992), especially at higher geomagnetic activity (Fauliot et al., 1993). CTIP-200 predicts \na meridional wind that is much too large but does a good fit to the zonal wind. In the lower thermosphere, HWM-\n90 makes a poor prediction of the wind with both components having the incorrect direction most of the time.  \n \n \nFig. 4. Upper (630 nm) and lower (557.7 nm) thermosphere neutral temperatures for 9-10\/2\/97 from the Skibotn \nFPI measurements (solid curve) and modelling with MSISE-90 at 240 and 115 km (dotted curve) and CTIP-200 at \n~250 and ~115 km (dashed curve), respectively. \n \n  5 \n \nCTIP-200 performs better but has the incorrect meridional direction before ~20 UT. The zonal wind has the correct \nbasic shape but is offset by ~100 m\/s Westward. It is clear that both models require improvement at both altitudes \non this day. \n \nFigure 4 shows upper and lower thermosphere neutral temperatures for the night of 9-10\/2\/97 from the Skibotn \nFPI. No EISCAT data was available. The top panel shows neutral temperatures from 630 nm (solid curve), with \nerror bars, and modelling results from MSISE-90 at 240 km (dotted curve) and CTIP-200 at ~250 km (dashed \ncurve). The bottom panel shows neutral temperatures from 557.7 nm (solid curve), with error bars, and modelling \nresults from MSISE-90 at 115 km (dotted curve) and CTIP-200 at ~115 km (dashed curve). Again, measured and \nmodelled neutral temperatures are mostly in good agreement. The decrease in emission altitude (see Figure 2) for \n557.7 nm is not clear here due to the high level of auroral activity. The large data gaps prior to local midnight are \ncaused by detector over-saturation due to strong auroral displays. After local midnight, data gaps are due to a very \nweak emission intensity, also resulting in the large error bars in 630 nm at the end of the night. \n \nFigure 5 shows the neutral winds for the night of 9-10\/2\/97 in the upper (630 nm) and lower (557.7 nm) \nthermosphere from the Ramfjord FPI measurements (solid curve), with an error of < \u00b1 10 m\/s (Nakajima et al., \n1995), and modelling with HWM-90 at 240 and 115 km (dotted curve) and CTIP-200 at ~250 and ~115 km \n(dashed curve), respectively. In the upper thermosphere, HWM-90 does a good prediction of the meridional wind \nbut the zonal wind has the incorrect direction before ~20 UT. CTIP-200 predicts the correct basic shape for both \n \n \nFig. 5.

In the lower thermosphere, HWM-90 makes a poor prediction of the \nwind with both components having the incorrect direction most of the time. CTIP-200 performs better but also has \nthe incorrect direction for the zonal component before ~22 UT. The meridional component has the correct basic \nshape but is offset by ~50 m\/s southward. Again, both models require improvement at both altitudes for this day. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nFrom 2 nights of observations (8-10 February 1997) in northern Scandinavia the following may be concluded. FPI \nneutral temperature measurements from Skibotn are in good agreement with EISCAT ion temperatures as well as \nthe MSISE-90 and CTIP-200 models. FPI wind measurements from Ramfjord illustrate significant discrepancies \nwith the HWM-90 and CTIP-200 model predictions in both the upper and lower thermosphere. Although models \nmay not always perform well in the auroral zone, due to short term localised energy inputs resulting from \ngeomagnetic substorms and auroral displays, room for improvement remains. \n \nACKNOWLEGEMENTS \n \nEISCAT is supported by Suomen Akatemia (Finland), Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique (France), \nMax-Planck-Gesellschaft (Germany), the National Institute of Polar Research (Japan), Norges forskningsr\u00e5det \n(Norway), Naturvetenskapliga forskningsr\u00e5det (Sweden) and the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council \n(UK).
