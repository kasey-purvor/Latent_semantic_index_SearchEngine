This article charts the discursive shifts that occurred during the passage of the Communications Act through Parliament and in the initial stages of its implementation to understand how and why the term \u2018citizen-consumer\u2019 came to lie at the heart of the new regulator\u2019s mission. By critically analysing the various alignments of \u2018citizen\u2019 and \u2018consumer\u2019 interests within the debates, the underlying struggles over the formulation of power, responsibility and duties for the new regulator and for other stakeholders \u2013 industry, government and public \u2013 are identified. The article concludes that the legacy of these debates is that regulatory provisions designed to further the \u2018citizen interest\u2019 contain significant and unresolved dilemmas.<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>\n        SAGE Publications<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>\n        2007-07<\/dc:date><dc:type>\n        Article<\/dc:type><dc:type>\n        PeerReviewed<\/dc:type><dc:format>\n        application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:language>\n        en<\/dc:language><dc:identifier>\n        http:\/\/eprints.lse.ac.uk\/2770\/1\/Citizens_and_consumers_%28LSERO%29.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\n          Livingstone, Sonia and Lunt, Peter and Miller, Laura  (2007) Citizens and consumers: discursive debates during and after the Communications Act 2003.
