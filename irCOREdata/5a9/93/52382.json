The extent to which this also\napplies to chemoradiotherapy, typically administered over\n5 weeks and followed by surgery several weeks later, is\nmore controversial. It is theoretically plausible that the\ncombined myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy and\npelvic radiotherapy attenuate the normal inflammatory\nresponse to surgical trauma, thereby increasing suscepti-\nbility to complications. Objective evidence of immuno-\nsuppression at the time of surgery following\nchemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer has been reported\npreviously, but any correlation with clinical morbidity\nwas not investigated [6].

The 37 most recently and consecutively treated\npatients were selected from this database as the study\ngroup. A control group of 34 consecutive patients\nundergoing elective surgery for cancer of the rectum or\nrectosigmoid without neoadjuvant therapy was identified\nfrom a second prospectively compiled database of all\ncolorectal cancer patients diagnosed since 2006. The use\nof all data for the purposes of this study was approved by\nthe local research ethics committee.\nFor all patients, local staging was based on a combi-\nnation of clinical assessment and pelvic magnetic reso-\nnance imaging (MRI), while distant metastases were\nexcluded by computed tomography (CT) of abdomen\nand thorax. Treatment was recommended to patients in\nlight of discussion by a multidisciplinary team, compris-\ning surgeons, oncologists, radiologists and pathologists.\nEligibility criteria for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy\nincluded histologically confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma\ninvolving or threatening the anticipated resection margin,\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) performance status\n0\u20132 and acceptable haematological and renal function,\ni.e. neutrophils > 1.5 \u00b7 109 \u2044 l, platelets \u2021 100 \u00b7 109 \u2044 l\nand serum creatinine < 1.25 times the institution\u2019s upper\nlimit of normal range.\nMegavoltage external beam radiotherapy was deliv-\nered using a three- or four-field box technique in the\nprone position using CT-based three-dimensional plan-\nning. To derive a planning target volume, margins were\nadded to the gross tumour volume as follows: 3 cm\nlaterally, superiorly and inferiorly; 2 cm anteriorly. The\nposterior border was always located on the most posterior\naspect of the bony sacrum. All study patients received a\ntotal of 45 Gy, delivered in 25 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy\nover 33 days.\nConcurrent chemotherapy was in the form of 5-\nfluorouracil (5-FU) or its oral equivalent capecitabine.\nThe former was usually administered as a 60-min infusion\nat a dose of 350 mg \u2044m2, along with 20 mg \u2044m2 folinic\nacid, on each of the first five and last 5 days of\nradiotherapy. Alternatively, a prolonged venous infusion\nof 5-FU was administered at a daily dose of 200 mg \u2044m2\nfor the entire duration of radiotherapy and for 3 weeks\nbeyond. Capecitabine was prescribed at a twice daily dose\nof 850 mg \u2044m2 during each day of radiotherapy.\nLocal protocol recommended that surgery be sched-\nuled for 6\u201312 weeks following completion of radiother-\napy. In practice, patients were usually assessed at 6 weeks\nby the operating surgeon, who decided whether to allow\nadditional time for tumour shrinkage. Surgery was\nperformed by, or under the direct supervision of, one\nof four consultant surgeons with colorectal expertise,\nwho routinely carried out total mesorectal excision.\nSurgical specimens were examined grossly and micro-\nscopically using TNM criteria, according to the Royal\nCollege of Pathologists\u2019 minimum dataset for colorectal\ncancer [8]. All lymph nodes retrieved were examined\nhistologically and any extramural deposits larger than\n3 mm in diameter were considered to be nodal. Patients\nwere usually reviewed by the surgical team within 6 weeks\nof their operation. For the purposes of this study,\ncomplete wound healing was defined as intact skin with\nno evidence of erythema, tenderness, fluctuance, dis-\ncharge or a sinus. Anastomotic leakage was diagnosed on\nthe basis of intra-operative findings, or clinically directed\nimaging alone if laparotomy was not performed.\nNeutrophil counts were obtained retrospectively from\nthe hospital\u2019s laboratory computer system. Preoperative\ncounts were defined as having been collected within\n10 days prior to surgery, while postoperative neutrophil\ncounts were all collected on the first postoperative day.\nThe incidences of local postoperative complications,\nnamely delayed perineal wound healing, anastomotic\nleakage and re-laparotomy for any other reason, were\nconfirmed by retrospective review of discharge letters and\noutpatient correspondence. Patients were excluded from\nsubsequent analysis if neutrophil counts were not avail-\nable from these specific times or if sufficient details of\ntheir postoperative recovery could not be obtained.\nData were analysed using statistical software (SPSS\nversion 15, SPSS, USA2 ). Shapiro\u2013Wilks tests assessed the\ndegree of normality for all baseline and outcome\nvariables. Depending on these, chi-square tests (for\ncategorical variables) and Mann\u2013Whitney U-test, ANO-\nVA or unpaired t-tests (for continuous data) were used to\nassess differences between the chemoirradiated and\nuntreated patients. Effect sizes were measured using\nCohen\u2019s d or Cramer\u2019s u, depending on the variable type\nand the comparison test used [9]. Correlation and\nequivalency tests were used to study the prognostic value\nof baseline variables in predicting changes in neutrophil\ncount and complications. Repeated-measures ANCOVA\nmodels were developed incorporating relevant covariates\nSuppression of the postoperative neutrophil leucocytosis1 S. F. Kerr et al.\n2 \u0002 2009 The Authors.

Similarly, ANCOVA models\nwere developed to study the association between change\nin neutrophil count and postoperative complications. The\nassociation between change in neutrophil count and\ninterval length was assessed using unpaired t-tests.\nResults\nSufficient data on perioperative neutrophil counts and\nmorbidity were available for 34 of 37 study patients and\n27 of 34 control patients. Among the study patients, 19\nhad received oral capecitabine and 15 had received\nintravenous 5-FU, of which the prolonged regimen\nthroughout the entire duration of radiotherapy and for\n3 weeks beyond was administered to only two patients.\nOne study patient was treated for recurrent rectal\ncancer; all other patients had primary disease. One patient\nin each group underwent simultaneous cystoprostatecto-\nmy and urinary diversion, while two study and one\ncontrol patients underwent hysterectomy and bilateral\nsalpingo-oophorectomy. Other baseline, operative and\npathological characteristics for each of the groups are\nshown in Table 1. Both preoperative and postoperative\nneutrophil counts were approximately normally distrib-\nuted.\nFigure 1 portrays the perioperative change in neutro-\nphil count for each group. Correlation and equivalency\ntests determined that age, tumour distance from anal\nverge and chemoradiotherapy were the only prognosti-\ncally significant variables for this outcome. Although the\ntwo groups\u2019 preoperative neutrophil counts were similar,\nrepeated-measures ANCOVA revealed significant differ-\nences between study and control patients (P = 0.02),\nwith a marked effect size (g2 = 0.14) and observed power\n(0.85). When relevant covariates were incorporated in\nthis \u2018between-subjects\u2019 comparison, neither age nor\ntumour distance from anal verge had significant effects\n(Table 2). Figure 2 portrays the perioperative increases in\nneutrophil count in terms of estimated marginal means,\ni.e. means after the covariates have been accounted for.\n\u2018Within-subjects\u2019 comparison tests confirmed a signif-\nicant postoperative increase in neutrophil count, irre-\nspective of group (Table 3). The interaction of\nmeasurement points with the variables included in the\nmodel did not reveal any significant differences for age or\ndistance, whereas chemoradiotherapy did appear to be a\nmajor determinant of this increase (Figure 3).\nFour patients died prior to discharge, including three\nwithin 30 post-operative days; all four had experienced\nanastomotic leakage. In total, seven of 26 anterior\nresections were complicated by clinically apparent anas-\ntomotic leakage. Two other patients with small bowel\nobstruction, one with intra-abdominal haemorrhage and\none with a small intestinal fistula required re-laparotomy\nprior to discharge. Complete perineal healing was not\nachieved by 6 weeks following 16 of 30 abdominoperi-\nneal resections.\nIn total, 25 of 61 (41.0%) patients experienced at least\none of these local postoperative complications.

With ANCOVA,\nthe association between change in neutrophil count and\ncomplications failed to reach statistical significance\n(P = 0.09), although the effect size was moderate\n(g2 = 0.05),\nFor the 34 study patients, the median interval from\ncompletion of radiotherapy to surgery was 74.5 (range\n50\u2013118) days. This value was used to divide these\npatients into two equally sized groups. Mean preoperative\nneutrophil count was 4.3 \u00b7 109 \u2044 l for the short interval\ngroup and 4.2 \u00b7 109 \u2044 l for the long interval group\n(P = 0.747). Mean perioperative increases in neutrophil\ncount were 3.1 \u00b7 109 \u2044 l and 3.2 \u00b7 109 \u2044 l respectively\n(P = 0.905).\nDiscussion and conclusions\nAt present, it is difficult to determine from the literature\nthe extent to which neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for\nrectal cancer influences postoperative morbidity. Most of\nthe large randomized trials of short-course radiotherapy\nhave demonstrated a detrimental effect of this regimen,\nparticularly with respect to perineal wound healing [2\u20135].\nIn turn, three randomized trials of preoperative chemor-\nadiotherapy vs short-course radiotherapy have reported\nthat the rates of postoperative complications were not\nsignificantly different between the two regimens [10\u201312].\nCombined modality treatment has also been implicated as\na cause of surgical morbidity by some retrospective\nanalyses [13\u201315]. By contrast, the only completed\nrandomized trial of preoperative vs postoperative che-\nmoradiotherapy reported no significant difference in\npostoperative morbidity between the two groups [16].\nHowever, it is possible that a true detrimental effect of\nchemoradiotherapy per se was obscured by the fact that\nthis treatment caused down-staging and altered the\noperative strategy in some patients.\nThis study provides evidence that neoadjuvant che-\nmoradiotherapy for rectal cancer suppresses the normal\ninflammatory response to surgical trauma, as measured by\nthe postoperative neutrophil leucocytosis, even at a\nmedian of 11 weeks following treatment completion.\nThis is broadly consistent with Wichmann et al.\u2019s pro-\nspective study, in which various inflammatory and\nPostoperativePreoperative\nEs\ntim\nat\ned\n m\nar\ngi\nna\nl m\nea\nns\n o\nf n\niu\ntro\nph\nil c\nou\nnt\n(\u00d7 \n10\n9 \/l\n)\n10.0 \n8.0 \n6.0 \n4.0 \nTreated \nUntreated \nFigure 2 Estimated marginal means of perioperative neutrophil\ncounts.\nTable 3 Tests of \u2018within-subjects\u2019 effects (*computed using\nalpha = 0.05).\nSource df F P-value g2\nObserved\npower*\nNeutrophil increase 1 11.641 0.001 0.17 0.92\nDistance 1 0.172 0.680 0.003 0.07\nAge 1 2.009 0.162 0.04 0.29\nChemoradiotherapy 1 6.236 0.015 0.10 0.69\nTreatedUntreated\nEs\ntim\nat\ned\n m\nar\ngi\nna\nl m\nea\nns\n o\nf c\nha\nng\ne \nin\nn\ne\nu\ntro\nph\nil c\nou\nnt\n (\u00d7\n 10\n9 \/l\n)\n5.5\n5.0\n4.5\n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\nFigure 3 Estimated marginal means of change in neutrophil\ncount.\nTable 2 Tests of \u2018between-subjects\u2019 effects (*computed using\nalpha = 0.05).\nSource df F P-value g2\nObserved\npower*\nIntercept 1 35.608 0.000 0.39 1.00\nDistance 1 0.825 0.367 0.02 0.15\nAge 1 0.037 0.848 0.001 0.05\nChemoradiotherapy 1 6.255 0.015 0.10 0.69\nSuppression of the postoperative neutrophil leucocytosis1 S.

Differ-\nences in the perioperative changes in granulocyte count\nbetween the two groups were not reported in their study\nand the implications for clinical morbidity were not\ninvestigated.\nThis study also found evidence of a suppressed\npostoperative neutrophil leucocytosis among those pa-\ntients subsequently developing local postoperative com-\nplications in comparison with their counterparts who had\nuncomplicated recoveries. This resembles Hartley et al.\u2019s\nexperience with short-course preoperative radiotherapy\n[7]. Although this secondary association lost statistical\nsignificance on multivariate analysis, this may simply\nreflect the small sample size, particularly as there was\na moderate effect size. A larger series of patients would\nbe required to explore satisfactorily the clinical\nsignificance of any myelosuppressive effect of\nchemoradiotherapy.\nThe findings of any small study such as this should be\ninterpreted with caution, as it is possible that they could\nhave arisen by chance. Much of the principal data were\ncollected retrospectively and, although consecutive pa-\ntients were recruited to minimize selection bias, some\nwere subsequently excluded due to incomplete data.\nPerhaps its main limitation is that the study and control\npatients were not optimally matched: for example, the\nformer were younger and had lower rectal tumours and\ntwo factors which would have contributed to their\nselection for neoadjuvant therapy. However, the statisti-\ncal analysis suggests that the apparent effect of chemor-\nadiotherapy is unlikely to be attributable to any of the\nother observed differences between the groups.\nAlthough pathological tumour stage was similar\nbetween the groups, the study patients might have had\nconsiderably larger tumours prior to treatment, which\none might speculate could have contributed to immu-\nnosuppression. It could also be argued that each of the\npatient groups was rather heterogeneous: for example, all\nthe study patients did not receive exactly the same\nchemotherapeutic regimen. A few patients underwent\nsynchronous resection of adjacent organs, but they were\nat least evenly distributed between the groups. The single\nmeasurements of wound healing and postoperative neu-\ntrophil count are rather crude outcome data, albeit\nconsistently collected. Finally, the relatively high rate of\nanastomotic leakage may simply reflect the small sample\nsize and has broad confidence intervals.\nIt might have been expected that the chemoradio-\ntherapy-induced suppression of the postoperative neu-\ntrophil leucocytosis would have become less pronounced\nwith longer intervals to surgery, as the bone marrow\nrecovered. This could have provided one explanation for\nthe positive association between shorter intervals and\npostoperative morbidity reported recently by the authors\n[17]. Although no such influence of interval length was\napparent in this study, a definitive exploration of this\nhypothesis would require a larger series of patients.\nIn summary, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is\nincreasingly employed in the management of rectal cancer\nbut its implications for surgical morbidity remain con-\ntroversial. Consistent with the limited available evidence,\nthis study suggests that the normal perioperative inflam-\nmatory response is suppressed by this treatment, increas-\ning susceptibility to local postoperative complications.\nFurther research is needed to ensure that patients with\nrectal cancer derive the optimal long-term oncological\nbenefit of chemoradiotherapy at minimal cost to their\nprospects of an uncomplicated postoperative recovery.\nAcknowledgements\nThis study was based on a prospectively-compiled data-\nbase, to which the contributions of Ms Juliet Grainger\nand the Rob Glynne-Jones Research Fund are acknowl-\nedged.
