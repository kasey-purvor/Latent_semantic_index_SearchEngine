Consequently, there is currently no suitable solution that can provide \neffective protection against high velocity projectiles produced by a fragmenting munition.  \n One possibility for improving the survivability of passengers and crew in a \ncivilian airliner is to harden the structure. This is problematic at best due to the increase \nin weight that would be expected from such a process. However if critical subsystems are \nsufficiently protected, it may be possible to prevent catastrophic failure of the aircraft \nwhen an anti-aircraft munition is detonated in close proximity.  \nFor the foreseeable future, carbon fibre materials will be extensively used in \naircraft design [2]. Most high-velocity studies with CFRPs to date have been done using \nsingle specimens of relatively thin laminates [e.g. 3-13] that offer very little protection \nagainst high velocity projectiles. These studies have shown that these materials have very \nlow trans-laminar strengths and provide very little protection against high energy threats \nsuch as a fragment from an anti-aircraft munition. Furthermore, there is a growing body \nof evidence that suggests that the lay-up type and sequence has little effect on the \nComposite Structures 91 (2009) 103\u2013109 \n 3\nperformance of a 2D laminate when the material is subjected to a high velocity impact. \nThis appears to be contrary to what has been observed during low velocity impact where \nwoven laminates appear to offer advantages [14-17] and where the stacking sequence has \nan effect [18]. Hazell et al. [3] have previously reported that small changes in the \nstacking sequence of a woven laminate had negligible effect on its energy absorbing \nabilities. Whereas Fujii et al. [4] noted that that there was little difference in the absorbed \nenergy when cross-ply [0\/90] laminates were compared to woven laminates. Furthermore, \nTanabe et al. [5] also showed no difference in energy absorption between cross-ply and \nwoven laminates. Hammond et al. [7] showed that thin laminates of different quasi-\nisotropic lay-ups did exhibit a difference in energy absorption. However, they noted that \nthe measured difference was small and was well within their experimental error. \nHowever, they also pointed out that unidirectional composites were significantly weaker \nthan the other lay-ups. Interestingly, Lopez-Puente et al. [19] have studied the effect of \nlow temperature on the impact response of CFRP laminates. They showed that quasi-\nisotropic tape laminates were less effective in terms of residual damage than woven \nlaminates due to the different flexural behaviour of the plies. However no residual \nvelocity was measured in this instance. They also showed that temperature has no effect \non damage extension implying that the energy absorbing characteristics at room \ntemperature are similar to that at lower temperatures experienced by high altitude aircraft. \n  There does, however, appear to be an effect on the material\u2019s energy absorbing \nability with changing the type of fibre \u2013 particularly on the rear surface of the laminate. \nTanabe et al. [5] have shown that small differences in ballistic performance are possible \nif carbon fibres of different properties are used in the through-thickness of the sample. \nComposite Structures 91 (2009) 103\u2013109 \n 4\nThey concluded that high tensile strength fibres should be used on the rear surface of the \nlaminate to maximise energy absorption of the projectile. Similar observations were made \nby Fujii et al. [4]. They also showed that failure modes were affected by the mechanical \nproperties of the fibre. Laminates with low strength carbon fibres resulted in specimens \nshowing plugging-type fractures.  \nLamontagne et al. [20,21] have studied the penetration of  CFRP laminates at \noblique angles; however, this was done at very high velocities that far exceed the \nvelocities of fragments that would be encountered by an aircraft structure. Here, the main \nfocus was on the response of space-craft structures to high velocity impact. Further high \nvelocity impact studies on CFRP-based space-craft structural materials have been \nconducted by Ryan et al. [22] and White et al. [23]. In these papers the authors turned \ntheir attention to the high velocity impact response of hybrid CFRP laminates consisting \nof either Kevlar layers or aluminium honeycomb bonded directly to CFRP laminates. It \nwas reported in [23] that the presence of Kevlar-epoxy layers reduced the extent of \ndelamination and increased the impact energy required to induce rear surface damage. \nAgain, in this work, the velocities of impact far exceeded those of interest in this paper. \nNevertheless, Kevlar is a composite material that is well known for its ballistic properties \nas are certain grades of aluminium alloy [24].  \nMost work to date has concentrated on very thin laminates (c.a. 2 mm) comparing \nthe ballistic performance of different quasi-isotropic lay-ups or comparing cross-ply \n[0\/90] with woven laminates. In this work we evaluate the ballistic performance of a \nrelatively thick symmetrical non-woven laminate over an impact energy-regime ranging \nfrom 92 J to 459 J and compare it to a similar woven laminate subjected to impact by \nComposite Structures 91 (2009) 103\u2013109 \n 5\nsimilar loading conditions [3]. Further we evaluate the energy dissipation and consequent \nimprovement in ballistic performance by adding Kevlar and aluminium layers to this \nlaminate in an attempt to show how the ballistic performance of these materials can be \nimproved. \n \nEXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY \n \nMaterials used \n \nThe materials chosen for this study were manufactured using the resin transfer \nmethod (RTM).  All individual panels were manufactured with Tenax HTS 5361 aero \ngrade fibres and chosen because they are commonly used in the aerospace industry. The \nlay-up consisted of 10 plys:  [0\/90, \u00b145, 0\/90, \u00b145, 0\/90]s. The thickness of each CFRP \npanel was 5.30 mm \u00b1 0.05 mm. The resin used was Hexcel RTM 6 cured for 1 hour 40 \nminutes at 180 \u00b0C and at a pressure of 90 psi. The dynamic behaviour of the cured resin \nhas previously been studied in [25]. The density of the CFRP material, measured using a \nMicrometrics AccuPyc 1330 gas pycnometer, was 1.53 g\/cc \u00b1 0.01 g\/cc. The mass \nfraction of the reinforcement was measured using the acid digestion method according to \nASTM D 3171-6, Procedure B [26] and was found to be 70.3\u00b11.0%. \nTwo additional materials were also used to construct the hybrid laminates. These \nwere Dural (Al 6061-T6) of thickness 1.02 mm \u00b1 0.01 mm and plain-weave Kevlar\u2122 29 \nfabric manufactured by DuPont (USA) with a yarn linear density of 1500 denier and a \nComposite Structures 91 (2009) 103\u2013109 \n 6\ntow count of 324 tows\/square inch.  Twelve layers of Kevlar fabric was chosen to match \nthe areal density of the Al6061-T6 (2.8 kg\/m2). \n \nTarget construction \n \nThe hybrid CFRP laminates were assembled by roughening the surface of each \ncomponent and applying a two-part epoxy adhesive (Araldite 2015) to bond the layers \ntogether under load. Eleven different targets were constructed as summarised in Figure 1 \nand Table 1. Two different bonding approaches were used for the Kevlar fabric. One set \nof targets were assembled by just bonding around the periphery of the target \n(Configurations H, I and J); a target was assembled by completely bonding the surfaces \nof each respective Kevlar layer to its neighbour (Configuration K). \n \nFigure 1: NEAR HERE. \n \n    \nImpact testing \n \nThe projectile used was a fully annealed stainless steel sphere (\u220511.97 mm \u00b1 0.01 \nmm; mass = 7.165 g \u00b1 0.001 g; VHN = 127). The balls (AISI 304) were fully annealed in \nair at 1050\u00b0C to provide equiaxed austenite grains and consequently isotropic behavior. \nThe yield strength of this steel at 21\u00b0C is 450 MPa with an ultimate tensile strength of \n675 MPa [27]. The projectile was fired from ELVIS, a single stage \u220522-mm gas-gun. \nThe impact energy ranged from 92 J \u2013 459 J corresponding to a velocity range of 160 m\/s \nComposite Structures 91 (2009) 103\u2013109 \n 7\nto 358 m\/s.  This range of velocities is lower than what would be expected from the \nmajority of fragments propelled from an anti-aircraft munition. Nevertheless, anti-aircraft \nmunitions provide a spread of fragments with a distribution of velocities and this velocity \nrange would be representative of some of the propelled fragments. Furthermore, this \nvelocity range is consistent with that of debris that may be propelled from the runway to \nthe underside of an aircraft during take-off and landing [e.g. 28-30]. Target specimens \nwere cut from the bonded panels into 150 mm \u00d7 150 mm squares and secured at the top \nand bottom using the target holder shown schematically in Figure 2. \nBoth impact and exit velocities were measured using a high speed video camera \n(Phantom 7; 20,000 frames per second; 2 \u00b5s exposure time). The energy transferred to \nthe panel was assessed by measuring the impact velocity and the residual velocity of the \nprojectile to an accuracy of <1 %. The energy transferred to the target (Et) was calculated \nfrom  \n \n( )22\n2\n1\nript vvmE \u2212=        (1) \n \nwhere mp is the mass of the projectile, and vi and vr are the impact and residual velocities. \nConsequently, the percentage change in kinetic energy (\u0394Ef) was calculated using \n \n100\u00d7=\u0394\ni\nt\nf E\nEE        (2) \n \nwhere Ei is the kinetic energy of the projectile prior to impact. \nComposite Structures 91 (2009) 103\u2013109 \n 8\n \nFigure 2: NEAR HERE. \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nThe response of the CFRP laminate alone (Configurations A and B) \n \nThe change in the kinetic energy (KE) for the single bare CFRP laminates \n(without any additional materials) is shown below in Figure 3. Results from similar \nimpact tests on a slightly thicker woven laminate (5HS) from [3] are also included for \ncomparison. In both cases, a rapid drop-off in the percentage of impact energy dissipated \nby the plate is apparent as the impact energy is increased. Both sets of results show that \nthe percentage of energy dissipated by the laminate appears to approach an asymptotic \nlevel. Further studies reported in [12] revealed that the asymptotic level for the 6-mm \nthick 5HS woven laminate was indeed reached at an impact energy of 2000 J with a \npercentage energy absorption of 20 %. \nIn two cases the sphere did not completely penetrate the composite laminate. At \nan impact energy of 105 J the sphere became completely embedded, whereas at an impact \nenergy of 92 J it rebounded, resulting in a lower percentage of energy being dissipated. It \nis notable that at the higher impact energies (>130 J) this CFRP laminate appeared to \nperform less-well than the 5HS woven laminate tested in [3]. The slightly poorer \nperformance is, perhaps, expected due to the lower thickness tested here. However, when \ncompared at an impact energy of c.a. 440 J the percentage of kinetic energy dissipated by \nComposite Structures 91 (2009) 103\u2013109 \n 9\nthe laminate, normalised by the thickness, is very similar (5.4 %\/mm).  Consequently, \nthese results imply that at the higher impact energies at least, our findings are similar to \nthe findings of Fujii et al. [4] and Tanabe et al. [5]. They showed that there was no \ndifference in the ballistic performance of a laminate regardless of lay-up. However, at an \nimpact energy of c.a. 120 J, the non woven laminate tested dissipated the same amount of \nkinetic energy as the thicker woven laminate tested in [3]. Indeed, extrapolation of the \nwoven laminate result in Figure 3 suggests that the thinner non-woven laminate \nperformed better than the woven laminate at the lower impact energies.  Although the \ndifferences do appear small, our results show that there are differences in the energy \nabsorbing ability between the two types of laminates at the lower impact energies with \nthe non woven laminate performing better.  \nAlso included in Figure 3 are two shots that were conducted on the two-part \nbonded CFRP laminates. At an impact energy of 245 J (261 m\/s), the projectile became \nfully lodged in the laminate and consequently the system completely absorbed all of the \nkinetic energy of the projectile. Increasing the impact energy to 436 J (349 m\/s) resulted \nin perforation. Nevertheless, a considerable amount of energy was dissipated by this \nrelatively thick laminate (77 %). This corresponded to a percentage of impact energy-per-\nunit-thickness of 7.1 %\/mm. For this given impact energy (c.a. 440 J), this implies that \nthe double-bonded laminates are more efficient at resisting penetration (per unit \nthickness) than the single laminates. This has been previously been seen with 5HS woven \nlaminate constructions [31]. \n \nFigure 3: NEAR HERE. \nComposite Structures 91 (2009) 103\u2013109 \n 10\n \nThe response of the single CFRP laminate that completely stopped the projectile \nwith an impact energy of 105 J is shown in Figure 4. It should be noted that the high-\nspeed video actually captured a frame every 50 \u03bcs.  However, in order to illustrate the \nnature of the impact a minimum interval of 100 \u03bcs is chosen in this case. Here the \nreference time (0 \u03bcs) is arbitrary and occurs when the projectile is 6.8 mm from the target \nface.  By 200 \u03bcs, the projectile was completely embedded in the laminate; by 3100 \u03bcs the \nprojectile is completely at rest and ejection of the rear-surface tows is seen. It can be seen \nthat at 100 \u00b5s, the laminate has been subjected to flexure prior to some of the tows being \nejected; in this case, only the final layer of tows (running into the paper) are ejected.  \n \nFigure 4: NEAR HERE \n \nAs shown in Figure 5, increasing the impact energy to 211 J (243 m\/s) results in a more \ncatastrophic failure as the projectile completely penetrates the CFRP laminate. There are \na few things to note here. Firstly, by 50 \u03bcs penetration of the target has begun and dishing \nis seen to occur at the rear of the target. Secondly, by 100 \u03bcs failure of the longitudinal \ntows is seen to occur as the dishing of the rear surface continues before; thirdly, the rear \ntows break away from the rear surface at 150 \u03bcs. By 250 \u03bcs, the projectile is clearly seen \nemerging from the target with a kinetic energy of 115 J (179 m\/s).  \n    \nFigure 5: NEAR HERE \n \nComposite Structures 91 (2009) 103\u2013109 \n 11\nWith this composite, the final layers of the carbon fibres appeared to have failed in \ntension. This behaviour is different from the penetration mechanism of the 6-mm woven \nRTM composite as seen in [3]. In this case, it was noted that at a higher impact velocity \n(305 m\/s) dishing preceded the formation of a plug of CFRP laminate inferring that a \ncompression \/ shearing mechanisms had occurred. It should be pointed out that in the \ncourse of the study of this particular laminate the formation of a plug of CFRP material \nwas not observed. Previously, other researchers have observed plug formation during the \npenetration of CFRP materials. Li and Sun [32] noted plug formation in thin CFRP \nlaminates that had been struck by a blunt-ended projectile at relatively low velocities \n(<100 m\/s). Further, Cantwell and Morton [8] have previously shown that during the \nperforation of a thin CFRP material, a frustum\u2013shaped fracture zone is formed. This \nobservation is consistent with the conically shaped plugs that were soft-captured in [3]. \n \nThe response of adding aluminium layers (Configurations C-F) \n \nThe ballistic performance of the aluminium-based laminates when perforated is \nsummarised in Figure 6. In each case, the impact velocity of the sphere was c.a. 350 m\/s \n\u2013 the maximum velocity attainable by the gun used in this experimental programme and \ncorresponding to an impact energy of c.a. 438 J. This velocity of impact resulted in a \npercentage of impact energy dissipated by the bear CFRP laminate of c.a. 30% which is \nclose to the level of absorption expected from single laminates subjected to much higher \nimpact velocities [12]. Also included in Figure 6 are the level of energy dissipated by \nboth a two-part bonded CFRP laminate and single laminate for comparison.  \nComposite Structures 91 (2009) 103\u2013109 \n 12\n \nFigure 6: NEAR HERE \n \nAs can be seen from Figure 6, c.a. 90 % of the projectiles KE was dissipated by the two-\npart bonded CFRP panel that included a Dural interlayer (configuration C). This out \nperformed the two-part bonded CFRP laminate (shown by the arrow). However, it should \nbe pointed out that although this system appeared relatively efficient, its areal density was \nconsiderably higher than the other systems tested (see Table 1). \n Placing a single thin layer of Dural on either the front or the rear surface appeared \nto improve the energy dissipation. The configuration with the aluminium on the rear layer \n(configuration F) appeared to dissipate slightly more projectile kinetic energy than that of \nthe configuration consisting of the layer on the front (configuration E). This is most \nprobably due to the fact that during penetration, the rear-layered target was able to dish \nquite considerably before petalling (see Figure 7) and consequently expend further \nenergy in the process (see Figure 8). Combining a Dural layer on the front and rear \nsurfaces of the CFRP laminate led to a percentage of KE absorbed of c.a. 70 %. \nConsequently the additional percentage energy absorbed was 42 % due to the addition of \nthe two layers when compared to the bare CFRP laminate. This value was similar to the \ncombined benefit of individually adding a front layer (20 %) and a rear layer (23 %) to \nthe CFRP implying that the two-layered system conveyed no additional systemic \nadvantage. That is, its energy absorption ability was not greater than that of the sum of its \nindividual parts.  \n \nComposite Structures 91 (2009) 103\u2013109 \n 13\nFigure 7: NEAR HERE \n \nFigure 8: NEAR HERE \n \nThe response of adding Kevlar layers (Configurations G-K) \n \nThe effect on the energy dissipation of the projectile by adding the Kevlar layers is \nshown below in Figure 9. Again, in each case, the impact energy of the sphere was c.a. \n440 J. \n \nFigure 9: NEAR HERE \n \nHere, the two-part bonded CFRP laminate with the Kevlar layer in-between \n(configuration G) outperforms the equivalent aluminium system (configuration C, shown \nin Figure 6). At this velocity, the system manages to defeat the projectile \u2013 completely \ndissipating its kinetic energy.  Adding the loose Kevlar layers to the rear of the CFRP \nlaminate resulted in a considerable improvement in performance of the system over and \nabove the fully bonded layers. Cheeseman and Bogetti [33] have noted that weak fibre-\nmatrix adhesion is desirable as this allows for fibre stretching. This results in the ready \ndelamination of the fabric, which allows the fibres to extend to failure and thereby \nfacilitating further energy expenditure. Figure 10 shows selected high speed video \nfootage of the steel sphere striking a CFRP laminate backed by 12 layers of Kevlar \n(configuration J); the impact energy was 444 J. In this case, the Kevlar fabric is bonded \nComposite Structures 91 (2009) 103\u2013109 \n 14\naround the periphery of the target only. It is evident that extensive deformation of the \ntarget is occurring during the penetration resulting in, this case, a relatively high level of \nenergy dissipation. Consequently, our results are consistent with Cheesman and Bogetti\u2019s \nobservation. Attaching layers of Kevlar on the front face of the CFRP resulted in 45% of \nthe projectile\u2019s kinetic energy being dissipated -- similar to the aluminium-faced CFRP. \nIn these cases, the presence of the CFRP laminate behind the reinforcing material \nprobably restricted the degree of deformation or fibre stretching thereby minimising the \nenergy absorption. Indeed, there was little sign of weave disruption close to the impact \nsite of the Kevlar-faced target. \n \nFigure 10: NEAR HERE \n  \nAnalysis of the areal densities \n \nBelow in Figure 11 we have plotted a performance map for each of the samples tested in \nthis experimental programme. We have assumed a linear behaviour in the percentage of \nenergy absorbed as the areal density of the CFRP increases from 8.1 kg\/m2 to 16.2 kg\/m2. \nConsequently, a straight line is plotted through the results for samples A and B.  By \nimplication, any results to the right of the line indicate a ballistic performance where the \nadditional material has a detrimental effect on the system\u2019s performance (from a weight \npoint-of-view). Conversely, any results to the left of the line show that the additional \nmaterial provides a benefit to the overall system. There are a few things to note from \nthese results. Firstly, it is notable that, apart from one case, the Kevlar-based targets \nComposite Structures 91 (2009) 103\u2013109 \n 15\nperformed considerably better than the aluminium-based targets (configurations C-F). \nThis perhaps, is expected given the known energy absorbing ability of woven aramid \nfabrics [33,34]. There is one notable exception in configuration I where the 12 layers of \nthe Kevlar on the front surface bestow little-to-no advantage over a bare CFRP laminate. \nFurthermore, rear-faced Kevlar performs better than placing layers on the front and the \nback \u2013 from a weight performance criterion. Secondly, configuration C is the only sample \nto fall to the right of the straight line. Although we note that the difference is small, the \nreduced performance of this target can be explained by sandwiching of the Dural in-\nbetween the CFRP laminates. Consequently, dishing (and energy absorption) was \ninhibited during penetration.  Thirdly, the addition of aluminium faces either to one or \nboth faces of the target (configurations D-F) led to only a small increase in ballistic \nperformance of the system when the additional weight was taken into account. \n These results show that a significant increase in energy absorbing ability is best \nachieved by fixing loose woven aramid fibres to the rear of the CFRP laminate. \n \nFigure 11: NEAR HERE \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nA series of high velocity impact tests have been carried out on a symmetrical non-\nwoven CFRP laminate and a variety of hybrid CFRP sandwich panels. The first objective \nof this work was to evaluate the ballistic performance of a relatively thick non-woven \nlaminate over an impact energy-regime ranging from 92 J to 459 J and compare it to a \nComposite Structures 91 (2009) 103\u2013109 \n 16\nsimilar woven laminate subjected to impact by similar loading conditions. The second \nobjective of this was work was to evaluate the energy dissipation and quantify the \nimprovement in ballistic performance by adding Kevlar and aluminium layers to the \nCFRP. This work has shown that: \n(1) Although the ballistic performance as measured per-unit-thickness was similar to an \nRTM-based woven structure at the high impact energies, there are strong indications that \nat the lower impact energies, the non-woven sample tested here out-performed the woven \nsample. \n(2) Adding 12 layers of ballistic grade Kevlar\u2122 loosely bound to the rear of the CFRP \nlaminate performed considerably better than other similar weighted configurations \nincluding the use of Dural. Indeed we have found that for an impact-energy of c.a. 440 J, \n93 % of the projectile\u2019s kinetic energy was dissipated as opposed to 77 % that can be \nachieved by bonding a second CFRP laminate of equal thickness to the target laminate. \n(3) Placing layers in-between two CFRP laminates, where the main mechanism of energy \nabsorption is through inelastic deformation due to dishing, results in a reduced ballistic \nperformance when weight is taken into account. \n(4) The addition of Kevlar to the front surface of the CFRP laminates resulted in little-to-\nno improvement to the ballistic performance of the system by virtue of the fact that the \nCFRP laminate appeared to restrict fibre extension. \nOverall it is apparent from this study that significant measurable improvements in \nballistic performance of CFRP-based structures can be introduced for only c.a. 25 % \nincrease in areal density. \n \nComposite Structures 91 (2009) 103\u2013109 \n 17\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThe majority of the experimental work was carried out during Mr Sanjeev \nAgawal\u2019s Military Vehicle Technology MSc course and consequently we are very \ngrateful for his contribution.
