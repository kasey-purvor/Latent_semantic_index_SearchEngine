Based on existing models and algorithms we developed a \nmethod to predict the environmental effects of SAF at a farm- and landscape-scale. The \nmethod comprised of an assessment of soil erosion, nitrogen leaching, carbon sequestration \nand landscape diversity and allowed the comparison of the environmental performance of \nSAF with arable systems using these four indicators. \nThe method was applied to three landscape test sites of 4 km x 4 km each in Spain, \nFrance and in the Netherlands, and compared different levels of agroforestry adoption on \nfarmland of different potential productivity. Silvoarable agroforestry was predicted to reduce \nsoil erosion by up to 70%, to reduce N leaching by 20-30%, to increase C sequestration over \n60 years by up to 140 t C ha-1, and to increase landscape diversity up to four times. The \nmethod developed was executed with widely available landscape and farm structural data and \ncan therefore be applied to other regions in order to obtain a broader assessment of the \nenvironmental performance of silvoarable agroforestry systems. \n \n \nKeywords: Erosion, nitrogen leaching, carbon sequestration, landscape diversity, modeling, alley cropping \n \n \n \n 2\nIntroduction \n \nSilvoarable agroforestry (SAF) involves the deliberate combination of trees and arable crops \non the same land management unit in some form of spatial arrangement or temporal sequence, \nsuch that there are significant ecological and economic interactions between trees and arable \ncomponents (Sinclair, 1999). In temperate environments, SAF has recently attracted interest \ndue to potential environmental benefits as compared with arable systems (Herzog, 2000), \nespecially as reducing negative environmental impacts of agriculture has become a major \nconcern of the European Union\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) (Buller et al., 2000; \nBaldock et al., 2002). SAF production systems are also efficient in terms of resource use \n(Nair, 1993) and are therefore proposed as innovative agricultural production systems that can \nbe both environmentally beneficial and economically profitable.  This would improve \nagricultural sustainability, provide opportunities to diversify farm income, provide new \nproducts to the wood industry, and create novel landscapes of high value (Dupraz & Newman, \n1997). \nCarruthers (1990) stated that agroforestry is an integrated approach that can enhance \necologically-sound agricultural production and achieve environmental benefits. Many authors \nsupport the view that environmental value can be gained using agroforestry in a European \ncontext (e.g. Herzog, 1998; Shakesby, 2002). Their statements, however, either relate to \nobservations made in traditional agroforestry systems or are based on conceptual \nconsiderations.  No systematic investigation of the environmental performance of modern \nSAF has been conducted so far. \nIn the context of an European research project of silvoarable agroforestry (SAFE, \n2001), four environmental benefits, which can be expected from SAF, were investigated: \n(a) Reduction of water-induced soil erosion (hereafter called soil erosion) which can \npreserve productive soil functions and mitigate the pollution of surface waters with soil \nparticles and absorbed phosphorus and pesticides; \n(b) Reduction of nitrate leaching through the formation of a \u201csafety net\u201d of tree roots under \nthe crops and increased water uptake of the system; \n(c) Carbon sequestration through the storage in wood not used for combustion; \n(d) Increase of landscape biodiversity due to an increased availability of habitats for wild \nspecies. \nThe majority of environmental modeling tools are developed at the point scale, where \necological processes are best understood (Visser & Palma, 2004). However, analysis at higher \nscale can better explain environmental phenomena (Grace et al., 1997), and this is particularly \nthe case with agroforestry due to the spatial interaction of tree and crop components.  \nMoreover, agroforestry will typically form only one of several systems of a farm (which may \nalso comprise grassland and arable rotation) as well as of a landscape (which consists of a \nmosaic of different land-use types). \nTherefore, modeling approaches are required which can bridge the gap between the \npoint and the farm- and landscape-scale. To do this, the level of detail of the models needs to \nbe adapted to the spatial resolution of the investigation, in order to minimize modeling error. \nFigure 1 illustrates that increasing model complexity and spatial resolution can be associated \nwith an increase in error due to additional data requirements. At the landscape scale, this may \nbe because the data required to derive process-based models of high thematic and temporal \nresolution are not available and need to be estimated. Hence, at the landscape scale, it is more \nappropriate to use algorithms which integrate existing knowledge about the processes and are \nlimited to the main governing factors. \nIn order to assess the previously mentioned environmental effects of SAF, we \ndeveloped assessment tools based on existing models and algorithms, which were applied in \nlandscape test sites (LTS) of 4 km x 4 km over a range of geographic situations from \n 3\nMediterranean to temperate Europe.  In this paper, a method to assess the selected \nenvironmental effects of SAF is explained and illustrated with results from three LTS located \nin Spain, France and in the Netherlands. These LTS are part of a larger sample described by \nGraves et al. (2007).  \n \n \nComplexity of model \nTo\nta\nl e\nrr\nor\n \/ \nva\nria\nbi\nlit\ny Error input data \nError processing  \nupscaling \nOptimum model \ncomplexity \n \nFigure 1: Relationship between model complexity and total error in the up-scaling process (Source: Wenkel & \nSchultz, 1999, modified). \n \nMaterial and methods \n \nData acquisition and processing  \n \nThe investigation was conducted for LTS in Torrijos (Spain), Champlitte (France) and \nScherpenzeel (The Netherlands)  For each LTS, aerial photographs, taken between 1999 and \n2004, were collected and the land use digitized. Soil properties were derived from existing \nsoil maps or through field work and a digital soil map was generated for each LTS. Digital \nElevation Models (DEM) were collected from national sources or developed by digitizing the \ncontour lines of topographic maps. All spatial information was stored and processed in \ngeographic information systems (ArcGIS \u2013 ArcInfo\u00a9 and ArcInfo WorkStation\u00a9 8.3). Daily \nand monthly weather data (temperature, precipitation and solar radiation) were generated \nusing Cligen 5.2 (in Lane & Nearing, 1995) from data for the nearest climate station to each \nLTS, compiled by Global Data Systems (GDS, 2005). Different sources of national \nagricultural statistics were used to complement data from the Farm Accountancy Data \nNetwork (FADN) (EC, 2003) and determine the types and typical size of farms present in the \nLTS.  \nThe main climatic parameters governing resource capture, growth and production in \nagroforestry systems were assumed to be precipitation, solar radiation and temperature (van \nder Werf et al., 2007). Temperature and precipitation were considered to be homogeneous \nwithin the LTS, while solar radiation was assumed to depend on the slope profiles derived \nfrom the DEM. The landscape solar radiation grid was calculated with DiGEM (Conrad, \n1998) and the radiation in each grid cell was expressed as a proportion of the radiation \nobtained in a flat, non shaded grid cell.  \n 4\nThe main soil property affecting tree and crop yields was assumed to be the available \nsoil water content. This was estimated from values for soil depth and the soil water release \ncurves identified for different soil textures (van Genuchten, 1980; W\u00f6sten et al., 1999). \nIn order to account for spatial variability in solar radiation and available soil water \ncontent  within each LTS, the LTS was divided into land units (LU) using cluster analysis \n(Ball & Hall, 1965; Richards, 1986) considering both, solar radiation and available soil water \ncontent as variables. Subsequently each LU was characterized by a mean proportion of total \nsolar radiation, the major soil texture and soil depth. This resulted in two LU of different \nproductivity for Torrijos and Champlitte, whereas Scherpenzeel resulted to be homogenous \n(Table 1). All the assessments (except for landscape diversity) were restricted to arable land \nas this was considered the target area for SAF.  The land units at Torrijos and Champlitte \nwere ranked according to potential productivity, and the crop rotation and agroforestry tree \nspecies for each LU was decided in workshops with experts and local stakeholders.  The size \nof a typical farm within each LTS was derived from the FADN (EC, 2003) and from local \nstatistics.  \nThe environmental assessments were undertaken assuming a 60-year rotation of the \nagroforestry system.  Because crop yields within an agroforestry system decline as the trees \nincrease in size and intercept more solar radiation, it was assumed that farmers would stop \narable cropping when it was unprofitable. The cut-off point was estimated from a five-year \nmoving average of profitability (Graves et al. 2007).  \n \nTable 1: Properties of landscape test sites and hypothetical farms for Torrijos in Spain, Champlitte in France and \nScherpenzeel in the Netherlands. \nCountry  Spain  France  The Netherlands \nLocation  Torrijos  Champlitte  Scherpenzeel \nLatitude (\u00b0) \nLongitude (\u00b0) \n 39.89 N \n4.39 W \n 47.64 N \n5.58 E \n 52.57 N \n6.34 E \nAltitude (m)  500  300  0 \nMean temperature (\u00b0C)  15.5  8.5  9 \nSolar radiation (MJ m-2)  5560  4940  3710 \nRainfall (mm)  348  773  801 \nFarm size (ha)  63  130  10 \nLand unit  1 2  1 2  1 \nQuality  worst best  best worst  n.a. \nArea (ha)  10 56  68 62  10 \nRadiation (%)  101 100  103 103  100 \nSoil type  medium medium  medium medium-fine  coarse \nSoil depth  140 140  140 35  140 \nTree species \n Holm oak \n(Quercus \nilex) \nHolm oak \n(Quercus \nilex) \n Wild cherry \n(Prunus \navium) \nWalnut \n(Juglans \nhybr.) \n Poplar \n(Populus \nspp.) \nCrop rotation  w\/f w\/w\/f  w\/w\/w\/w\/w\/m w\/w\/o  s \nNote: w, wheat; f, fallow; o, oilseed rape; m, grain maize; s, silage maize \n \nAssessment of soil erosion \n \nErosion processes and concepts are well-described (e.g. Morgan, 1995; Terrence et al., 2002) \nand numerous soil erosion models have been developed (e.g. Wischmeier & Smith, 1978; \nMorgan et al., 1998). Our assessment was based on the revised universal soil loss equation \n(RUSLE) (Renard et al., 1997) (Equation 1): \nE = R \u00b7 K \u00b7 LS \u00b7 C \u00b7 P       (Equation 1) \n 5\nwhere: E is the soil loss (units: t ha-1 a-1); R is the rainfall erosivity factor calculated over one \nyear (units: MJ mm ha-1 h-1 a-1 ); K is the soil erodibility factor (units: t h MJ-1 mm-1); LS is the \nslope-length factor; C is the cover management factor and P is the erosion control practice \nfactor. LS, C and P are unitless. \nThe R-factor was calculated according to van der Knijff et al. (2000), based on a fuzzy \ninterpolation between two models (one for Northern Europe and the other for Southern \nEurope), which enabled the calculation of the R-factor for any latitude of Europe based on \nmean annual precipitation. For simplicity, precipitation was assumed to be uniform within \neach LTS, although this may create some error (Lima et al., 2003).  The K-factor was derived \nfor each soil map unit based on the texture of the top horizon of the soil (R\u00f6mkens et al. \nquoted in Renard et al., 1997).  The Arc Macro Language (AML) used in ArcInfo\u00a9 and \ndeveloped by van Remortel et al. (2001) was used to compute the LS-factor. \nBecause SAF has an arable and a forestry component, equation 2 was developed to \ncalculate the C-factor (C) for agroforestry: \nC = [Covera  \u00b7 Ca] + [Coverf \u00b7 Cf]      (Equation 2) \nwhere Covera and Coverf are the proportions of the total area occupied by the arable and \nforestry component respectively (0-1), and Ca and Cf are the related C-factors for the arable \nand forestry component. The values of Covera and Coverf depend on the distance between the \ntree rows and on the tree row strip width. In the scenarios studied, it was assumed that the \nagroforestry system comprised 113 trees per hectare and Covera and Coverf were assumed to \nbe 0.91 and 0.09 respectively. The value of Cf was computed according to Dissmeyer & \nFoster (1980), and Ca was determined for each crop type based on Meyer (1996) and \nFeldwisch (1998).  When the arable rotation was stopped due to unprofitability, Ca took the \ncorresponding value for a grass cover. \n  \nAssessment of nitrate leaching \n \nAlthough the nitrogen cycle in agricultural systems is complex (Whitehead, 1995), relatively \nsimple equations for nitrate leaching can differentiate between different land-use systems at \nthe regional scale. Using the approach of Feldwisch et al. (1998), the quantity of leached \nnitrogen (Nleach; units: kg ha-1 a-1) was determined from: \nNleach = 4.43 \u00b7 Nbal  \u00b7 EF    (Equation 3) \nwhere: Nbal is the nitrogen balance (kg ha-1 a-1), and EF is the annual soil water exchange \nfactor (unitless).   \nThe value of EF depends on the calculated annual flow to groundwater (Fgw; units: \nmm), and the soil water content at field capacity (FC; units: mm) (Equation 4).  \nIf: \nFC\nFgw \u2265 1, then EF = 1      (Equation 4) \nIf: \nFC\nFgw < 1, then EF = \nFC\nFgw  \nAnnual values for groundwater recharge were determined by summing daily values \nfor Fgw derived from a process-based biophysical model called Yield-SAFE (van der Werf et \nal., 2007) which was parameterized and calibrated for the tree species and crop rotation at \neach LTS (Graves et al., 2007).    \nThe value of the nitrogen balance (Nbal) was determined on an annual basis from: \nNbal = (Nfert + Adep + Nfix + Nmin) \u2013 (D + V + U + I)    (Equation 5) \n 6\nwhere: Nfert is the addition of nitrogen fertilizer (mineral and organic); Adep is the atmospheric \ndeposition; Nfix is the biotic nitrogen fixation; Nmin is the mineralization; D is the \ndenitrification; V is the volatilization; U is the crop\/tree uptake, and I is the, immobilization; \nall units in kg N ha-1a-1. \n  \nIn long-term assessments with a regular cropping pattern, a steady state equilibrium is \nexpected between mineral nitrogen released by the soil (mineralization) and the amount of \nnitrogen annually returned to the soil in the form of organic matter (immobilization) (Noy-\nMeir & Harpaz, 1977; Vlek et al., 1981).  Equation 5 can therefore be simplified to: \nNbal = (Nfert + Adep + Nfix) \u2013 (D + V + U)     (Equation 6) \nDuring the SAF rotation, tree growth and the later conversion to permanent grassland may \ndisturb the Nmin-I equilibrium trough the addition of organic matter (leaf fall, grassroots). \nHowever, Yield-SAFE did not allow to model these aspects. We assumed that farmers would \nnot account for the slightly increased nitrogen availability under SAF due to leaf fall whereas \nunder grassland, no nitrogen application was presumed. \nThe value of Nfert is usually difficult to obtain in studies with a large geographic scope.  \nWe therefore adopted the approach used by Van Keulen (1977; 1982) for determining a \nrelationship between yield and fertilizer inputs for given soil properties. This allowed Nfert to \nbe derived from the crop and tree yield values predicted by the Yield-SAFE model (Graves et \nal., 2007; van der Werf et al., 2007). For a given crop and tree yield, the nitrogen uptake (U; \nunits: kg N ha-1); was estimated as: \n22\n4\n2\nmaxmax\nmax\nYYifBYY\nY\nYifB\nY\nU\nct\nc\nct\nc\n\u2265+\u2212\n<+\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23a7\n=\n\u03bb\u03b1\n\u03bb\u03b1\n    (Equation 7) \nwhere:  Yc is the crop yield (unit: kg ha-1); Ymax is the maximum crop yield (unit: kg ha-1); Bt is \nthe above-ground tree biomass (unit: kg ha-1); \u03b1 is the slope from quadrant \u201ca\u201d in van Keulen \n(1982), and \u03bb is a conversion factor to derive tree nitrogen uptake from Bt.  The value of \u03b1 is \ndependent on the biomass of the straw (S; unit: kg ha-1) and the harvested product (Yc).  A \ncontent of 1% and 0.4% N in the grain and straw was assumed respectively (van Keulen & \nWolf, 1986) (Equation 8): \ncY\nS004.001.0\n1\n+\n=\u03b1        (Equation 8)  \nThe value of \u03bb is dependent on the root to shoot ratio of the tree (RSR; unitless), and we \nassumed 0.66% and 0.41% concentration of N in the tree above ground and below ground \nbiomass respectively (Gifford, 2000a, 2000b) (Equation 9).  A root to shoot ratio of 0.25 was \nassumed as proposed by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 1996) for \nbroadleaved tree species. \n\u03bb = 0.0066 + (0.0041 RSR)       (Equation 9) \nThe fertilizer application was then estimated by: \n\u03b2\nUN fert =         (Equation 10) \n 7\nwhere \u03b2 , the recovery factor, is a fraction between 0.5 and 0.8 depending on the management \nof nitrogen application (van Keulen, 1977, 1982; van Keulen & Wolf, 1986). In all LTS, \u03b2 \nwas assumed to be 0.65. \nAdep was obtained by summing values of oxidized and reduced nitrogen deposition \nfrom EMEP (2003).  Values for denitrification (D) were derived from reference tables  \n(Feldwisch et al., 1998) and available water table information. Where no information about \nthe water table in the LTS was available, an average value for D was adopted (30 kg N ha-1a-\n1). As organic fertilization was not considered separately, volatilization (V) was derived from \nmineral N application, as in van Keulen et al.  (2000) and estimated as 5% of Nfert. As there \nwas no legume crop modeled, Nfix was estimated for non symbiotic organisms as 1 kg N ha-1 \na-1 (Wild, 1993). \n \nAssessment of carbon sequestration \n \nCarbon sequestration by the trees (Cseq; units: kg ha-1) was calculated as proposed by Gifford \n(2000a): \nCseq = 0.5 (Bt + RSR \u00b7 Bt)      (Equation 11) \nwhere, Bt is aboveground tree biomass (kg ha-1), predicted by the Yield-SAFE model \n(Graves et al., 2007). \n \nAssessment of landscape biodiversity \n \nThe introduction of SAF into a predominantly arable landscape will generally increase the \ndiversity of habitats in that landscape. We adopted an index which relates the share of habitat \nthat potentially adds biodiversity to the native species that persist in rural areas. We \nhypothesized that SAF, with a strong interaction between the permanent (tree) component and \nthe crop component, adds a new habitat to the arable landscape matrix (Burgess et al., 2003). \nThe habitat index (Ihab) was defined as: \ntotal\nhab\nhab A\nA\nI =         (Equation 12) \nwhere Ahab is the area of non-arable habitats (ha) and Atotal is the total area (ha).  The value of \nAhab was calculated as the area sum of forest, traditional orchards, riparian strips, hedges, \nshrub land, permanent grassland, fallow land, permanent grassland, and SAF for each LTS.  \n \nScenarios \n \nThe LTS is also representative of the hypothetical farm of the dominant type in each of the \nthree regions. We wanted to know whether \u2013 in order to generate environmental benefits \u2013 \nfarmers should implement SAF on a small (10%) or a large part (50%) of the farm, and \nwhether SAF should be implemented on the most productive (\u201cbest land\u201d) or least productive \n(\u201cworst land\u201d) sites. These questions were formalized in four scenarios (converting 10 or 50% \nof the best land, or 10 or 50% of the worst land to SAF) which were compared to the present \nsituation (\u201cstatus quo\u201d arable system). In the context of soil erosion, the effect of contouring \npractices where farming operations follow the contour lines of the terrain and where trees \ncould be planted along contours was also examined.  \nFor each land unit, an appropriate SAF tree species was selected according to the \ntrees\u2019 requirements for profitable growth (Reisner et al., 2006).  The crop rotation in the \narable system and the crop component of the silvoarable system (Table 1) followed the same \n 8\nstatus quo rotation, unless the crop component of the silvoarable system became unprofitable, \nin which case grass was assumed (Graves et al., 2007).  Simulations were run over a standard \nperiod of 60 years, equivalent to the length of a single life cycle of oak (Quercus ilex), walnut \n(Juglans hybr.) and wild cherry (Prunus avium) and to three growth cycles of 20-years each \nfor poplar (Populus spp.). \n \nModel results interpretation \n \nThe interpretation of the results is to be focused on the relative differences between scenarios \nrather than on the absolute values. The assessments assumed simple interpolation between \nplot-, farm-, and landscape- scales, and the appropriateness of this up- and down-scaling has \nbeen debated (Bierkens et al., 2000; Stein et al., 2001; Vachaud & Chen, 2002; Visser & \nPalma, 2004). However, scale research will not be discussed here, although it is recognized as \nan important issue in model predictions. The objective of this paper was to develop a set of \nassessment tools and algorithms for major environmental indicators \u2013 not to estimate absolute \nvalues of soil loss, nitrate leaching, carbon sequestration and landscape diversity. The \nemphasis therefore is on possible differences among alternative land-use types, although \nabsolute values are indicated to judge the order of magnitude of the computed values. \n \n \nResults and discussion \n \nValidity of the approach \n \nThe time frame of assessment was 60 years, longer than the duration of any European \nsilvoarable agroforestry experiment.  Moreover, investigations in existing experimental plots \nmostly deal with productivity (Burgess et al., 2004), and data on environmental performance \nof SAF systems are scarce.  We based the validity of the modeled results on experimental \nevidence when possible, but we also had to rely on information from the literature. \nThe importance of taking the uncertainty in model predictions into account is \nincreasingly recognized (Power, 1993; Wallach & G\u00e9nard, 1998). Uncertainty analysis is an \nevaluation approach for measuring the reliability of model predictions in order to apply \nresults in decision making or in land use evaluation. The analysis is performed to reduce the \nmodel output imperfections through recognition of possible model improvements. This can be \nachieved by identifying the essential processes of the model and by investigating which \nalgorithms of the model may need further improvement (Wallach & G\u00e9nard, 1998; Keesman \n& Stappers, 2004). Our investigation, however, was focused on identifying differences \nbetween scenarios rather than obtaining precise predictions. In agreement, the estimation of \nuncertainty in the results of the environmental assessments was rather descriptive and \nqualitative.  \nHowever, prior to the application of the newly developed models, the different \nunderlying (sub) tools and algorithms have been evaluated. The evaluation consisted of a \nrigorous parameterization phase (implementing expert knowledge), a sensitivity analysis, \ncalibration to many different sites and plant species and\/ or a validation phase with \nexperimental data. \n \nAssessment of soil erosion \n \nThe calculated soil loss rates in the arable plots of the LTS ranged from 0.5 to 1.8 t ha-1a-1.  \nThese are of a similar magnitude to those indicated in the European soil erosion map (van der \nKnijff et al., 2000).  Although absolute values from an empirical model, that has not been \n 9\nlocally calibrated, should be interpreted with caution (Centeri, 2003), the outputs from \nRUSLE can still indicate relative differences between alternative land-use types (van \nRemortel et al., 2001).  \nIn Torrijos and assuming no contouring, RUSLE predicted an annual soil loss of about \n1.8 and 0.8 t ha-1 for the high (LU2) and low (LU1) quality land, respectively in the arable \nsystem (Figure 2). The fact that the predicted soil erosion was greater on high- than on low-\nquality land was primarily due to a more intensive rotation on high-quality land. Assuming \ncontouring, the corresponding values were only 1 and 0.5 t ha-1. The impact of SAF assuming \ncontouring decreased these values to 0.3 and 0.1 t ha-1 respectively. A similar benefit has been \nshown for hedgerow intercropping, where soil erosion was reduced by up to 90% on gentle \nslopes in Nigeria, and by 45-65% on steep slopes in maize systems in Colombia (Young, \n1989).  The use of RUSLE did not account for gully erosion. In fact, if agroforestry is \nimplemented without contouring, the probability of gully erosion along the tree strips could \nbe increased due to greater erosivity of water drops under the tree canopy (Young, 1989) and \nthis could again compensate for the reduction of soil erosion achieved through SAF.  \nBy using the proportions of the different LU in each LTS (Table 1), the mean annual \nsoil loss was estimated for the arable system for each LTS with and without contouring (Figure \n3).   Erosion rates were predicted to be similar in Champlitte and Torrijos (0.8 - 1.8 t ha-1) and \nlower (0.3 - 0.5 t ha-1) in Scherpenzeel. Contouring practices were consistently projected to \nreduce erosion. The greatest reduction in soil erosion (-72%) was predicted for Champlitte by \ncombining contouring with SAF on 50% of the farm (Figure 3). \n \nFigure 2: Estimated soil loss, at plot scale, for arable systems (St. Quo) and agroforestry (SAF113) in the Torrijos \nlandscape test site, central Spain.

See Table 1 for crop rotations and \ntree species, section Scenarios for definition of scenarios. \n \nAssessment of nitrate leaching \n \nThe assessment of nitrate leaching was based on tree and crop yields over a rotation of 60 \nyears derived from the Yield-SAFE model (van der Werf et al., 2007) which was \nparameterized and calibrated for the selected tree and crop species in each LTS (Burgess et \nal., 2005).  For the low quality LU in Champlitte, annual crop yield in the arable system \nranged from 1.8 to 5.8 t ha-1 for wheat and 2.4 to 3.7 t ha-1 for oilseed (Figure 4a), and tree \nyield of walnut was assumed to be 69 m3 ha-1 after 60 years (Figure 4b).  This assumed \noptimum availability of nutrients.  \nNitrogen input (Figure 4c) was estimated from biomass production. In the SAF system, \nalthough nitrogen uptake by the trees increased with time, this did not compensate for the \nreduced nitrogen uptake in the arable component and consequently total uptake in the SAF \nsystem was lower than in the arable system (Figure 4d).  However, evapotranspiration for the \nSAF system was predicted to exceed that for the arable system, resulting in less groundwater \nrecharge (Figure 4e) and reduced vertical transport of nitrogen. At year 40 the rotation was \nstopped due to economic restrictions (Figure 4a) resulting in a stop of nitrogen fertilization \n(Figure 4c). As a consequence, predicted cumulated nitrogen leaching over 60 years was \nreduced by 40% (Figure 4f). \nThis approach assumed that N fertilizer application was always well-matched to the \nyield obtained.  This assumption, which holds for both the arable and silvoarable scenarios, is \nprobably realistic, as farmers do modify nitrogen fertilizer management in response to \nvariations in climatic conditions and yield expectations.  The reduction in crop yield (Figure \n4a) caused by increasing competition for water and light from the tree is a predictable effect \nthat farmers can take into account when calculating fertilizer input.  The calculated relative \ndifferences in N-leaching (Figure 4f) among the scenarios are therefore plausible. \nNitrogen application rates predicted for the three LTS (Figure 5) were generally lower \nthan or similar to values in the literature.  Predicted mean annual application rates for Torrijos \nwere 40 and 36 kg in land units 1 and 2, respectively.  This is within the range reported by \nSadras (2002) for rainfed Mediterranean conditions. In Champlitte, the predicted mean annual \napplications were 153 kg in LU 1 and 90 kg in LU 2 (Figure 4c).

No leaching was \npredicted at Torrijos as there was no groundwater recharge and this result agrees well with the \ngeneral perception that leaching from deep soils under rainfed agriculture in the \nMediterranean climate is negligible (Seligman et al., 1992; Sadras, 2002).  Typical values for \nannual N leaching from temperate European locations are 10 to 80 kg ha-1 (Nemeth, 1996; \nHadas et al., 1999; Ersahin, 2001; Hoffmann & Johnsson, 2003).  Slightly higher values of up \nto 100 kg N ha-1 a-1 were indicated by Di & Cameron (2002) and Webster et al. (2003).  \nSchr\u00f6der (1998) reported annual nitrate leaching of 50-250 kg N ha-1 in forage maize systems \nin sandy soils in the Netherlands.   \nThe analysis predicted that implementing SAF on 50% of the farm area would reduce \ncumulative nitrogen leaching over a 60-year rotation by 30% at Champlitte and Scherpenzeel \n(Figure 5).  These reductions appear less than the 40% reduction reported by Udawatta et al. \n(2002) in young temperate agroforestry systems for a three-year period.  However, our \napproach does not account for the potential of the tree roots to recover nitrogen from below \nthe crop rooting zone (Sanchez, 1995; van Noordwijk et al., 1996; Rowe et al., 2001; \nUdawatta et al., 2002), thus leading to a conservative estimate of the potential reduction in \nnitrogen leaching. \nThe introduction of SAF was predicted to show the greatest reduction in nitrogen \nleaching when implemented on the highest quality land. At Champlitte, this was partly due to \nthe predicted competitive ability of the tree species used on the best land (walnut) being \nhigher than of the tree species on the poor land (wild cherry).  For walnut, the biophysical \nmodel predicted an earlier impact on the intercrop yield than for cherry and cumulative \nleaching was therefore more severely reduced. However, because the worst land (shallower \nsoil) accounted for the majority of the leaching (76%) in the whole LTS, the ponderated effect \nof SAF on the best land at farm\/landscape scale is blurred in the cumulated results, which \nshow the best impact in the lowest quality land (Figure 5 \u2013 Champlitte). In Scherpenzeel, \nwhere land quality was uniform, and a fast-growing tree (Populus spp.) was planted, leaching \nwas reduced by 5 and 30% when SAF was implemented on 10 and 50% of the land, \nrespectively (Figure 5 \u2013 Scherpenzeel).  \n \n \nFigure 5: Estimated N leaching at the farm\/landscape scale, cumulated over 60 years, for Torrijos (Spain), \nChamplitte (France) and Scherpenzeel (the Netherlands).

Lehmann & Gaunt (2004) and Harmand et al. (2004) reported that \nagroforestry systems are unlikely to lead to significant long-term soil carbon sequestration, as \norganic matter produced is relatively quickly decomposed. Therefore, the main difference in \nsequestration between an arable system and an agroforestry system lies in the carbon \nimmobilized in the tree biomass (Alegre et al., 2004). \n Total carbon sequestered in the tree biomass for each LU was estimated using the \nabove-ground-tree biomass predicted by the Yield-SAFE model (Graves et al., 2007) and \nEquation 11.  Assuming an implementation of agroforestry on half of the area, over a 60-year \nrotation, the values of carbon were 12, 43 and 140 t ha-1 in Torrijos, Champlitte and \nScherpenzeel respectively (Figure 6).  These values are within the range of 3-60 t ha-1 for \nagroforestry systems and 190 t ha-1 in poplar forests reported in literature (K\u00fcrsten, 2000; van \nKooten, 2000; van Kooten et al., 2002; McKenney et al., 2004).  \nThe variation in rate of carbon sequestration among the three LTS was caused by \ndifferences in predicted growth rate of the tree species selected at each site. In the low rainfall \nareas of Spain, holm oak was predicted to grow slowly and sequestration was also low. At \nChamplitte, for walnut and wild cherry moderate levels of growth and sequestration were \nexpected. Carbon sequestration, however, was highest for the three 20-year cycles of poplar at \nScherpenzeel.   \nTotal carbon sequestration was predicted to increase linearly with increasing \nproportion of land planted to agroforestry between 10 to 50% (Figure 6). Land quality had \nonly a minor effect and further investigations are needed to substantiate these results. \n \n \nFigure 6: Estimated carbon sequestration at the farm\/landscape scale, cumulated over 60 years, for Torrijos \n(Spain), Champlitte (France) and Scherpenzeel (the Netherlands).

Moreover, \nthe boundaries between different land-use types (or habitats) multiply and these also consist \nof specific habitats for some species (Forman & Godron, 1986; Smart et al., 2002). \nWhen considering arable and SAF systems, we assumed that introducing lines of trees \nin homogeneous arable areas would increase the landscapes\u2019 structural diversity and thus \npotentially their species richness. The trees can provide habitats for some bird and arthropod \nspecies. The grassy or herbaceous strip bellow the trees consists either of sown plant species \nor of arable weeds; its contribution to species diversity will strongly depend on the \nmanagement. \nTo assess the potential impact of SAF on biodiversity at landscape scale, we assumed \na direct relationship between biodiversity and the proportion of the area occupied by non-\narable (including SAF) and arable habitats (see Equation 12). This approach only accounts for \nlandscape composition, and not for its configuration. It is therefore assumed that the increase \nof natural and semi-natural landscape elements will lead to an increase in biodiversity. \nThe relative difference between the status quo and the SAF scenarios depends on the \nhabitat areas currently present. Figure 7 illustrates Equation 12 and relates the effect of \nconverting different proportions of the arable land (10 to 90%) into SAF, and the existing \nproportion of non-arable habitat (5 to 90%). \nConsequently, in the sites under investigation, introducing SAF had the strongest \nimpact at Scherpenzeel which had the lowest initial proportion of non-arable habitat.  The \nconversion of 50% of the farm into SAF increased the proportion of non-arable habitat by \n400% at Scherpenzeel and by 100% in Torrijos and Champlitte (Figure 8). \nThe biodiversity of a new SAF system differs from the existing biodiversity in well \nestablished traditional agroforestry systems such as dehesas or traditional orchards (e.g. \nAnderson & Sinclair, 1993; Herzog, 1998; Plieninger & Wilbrand, 2001; Huang et al., 2002) \nTheir species compositions have evolved over decades, with many species depending on \nrelatively stable conditions and being poor colonizers of new areas (Le Duc et al., 1992). \nNevertheless, although further research is needed, recent studies on newly established SAF \nsystems suggest an increase in biodiversity levels (Burgess et al., 2003). \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nStatus  quo Ihab (% )\nFi\nna\nl I\nha\nb\n (%\n)\nConv 10% Conv 20% Conv 30%\nConv 40% Conv 50% Conv 60%\nConv 70% Conv 80% Conv 90%\n \nFigure 7: Relation between Status quo and Final natural and semi-natural habitat index (Ihab) by converting \ndifferent proportions of arable land into agroforestry in the farm\/landscape.

The \ninvestigation of the environmental performance of land-use systems through experiments, \nhowever, is costly \u2013 especially at landscape scale. If trees are involved, long\u2013term \nexperimentation requires many years before results are available. Initiation of such \nexperiments becomes increasingly difficult (Poulton, 1995).  Therefore the modeling \napproach described here provided an appropriate method for assessing the environmental \neffects of agroforestry.  \nWe opted for a broad view which covered four different environmental indicators (soil \nerosion, nitrogen leaching, carbon sequestration, landscape biodiversity), is applicable over a \nlarge geographic range (from Mediterranean to temperate Europe) and is based on the spatial \nand economic data that are generally available (except for the soil maps in Torrijos, which \nwere based on field work). \nAlthough the model results appear plausible in view of available information from \nliterature, they can be further improved. Erosion could be assessed for different types of tree \nstrip management and algorithms accounting for gully erosion could be added. The nitrogen \nleaching assessment could be improved by adding mineralization of tree litter or of pruning, \nwhich would reduce the rate of fertilization in SAF systems. Moreover, tree N uptake from \nbelow the crop root-zone would need to be accounted for. The description of the water \nbalance could be improved by incorporating irrigation (Mayus et al., 2005), this would in turn \nincrease the scope of the model for N leaching studies. Also, in the future it should be \npossible to account for the potential access of tree roots to a water table; this would enlarge \nthe range of possible situations which could be investigated. The assessment of carbon \nsequestration could be complemented with improved carbon allocation models. The \nestimation of landscape diversity could be complemented by fragmentation indices and by \ntaking into account the spatial allocation of SAF in the landscape supported by field \nvalidation and research.  More sophisticated approaches, however, require more input data of \ngreater precision to improve the quality of the predictions. We argue that, for the purpose of a \nbroad assessment of the effect of SAF, our approach provides a balance between modeling \ncomplexity, the number of indicators and the geographic range under investigation (Figure 1). \nTorrijos\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nStatus\nQuo\nSAF113\nin 10%\nSAF113\nin 50%\nH\nab\nita\nt i\nnd\nex\n (%\n)\nCham plitte\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nStatus\nQuo\nSAF113\nin 10%\nSAF113\nin 50%\nScherpenzee l\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nStatus\nQuo\nSAF113\nin 10%\nSAF113\nin 50%\n 16\nThe most important activity in improving model predictions would be local validation of \ninput and output data. \nThe results suggest that SAF could reduce soil loss when introduced on high quality \nland, where intensive crop rotations are used. Contouring was more effective than SAF in \ncontrolling soil erosion, however, the greatest reduction in soil erosion was achieved through \nthe combining SAF and contouring. The results also indicate that SAF could potentially \nreduce nitrogen leaching. Further investigations are needed to establish the order of \nmagnitude and the influence of tree species and on productivity levels, and thus on the \nnitrogen cycles. Our predicted N-leaching reductions were conservative, as tree N uptake \nfrom below the crop root-zone was not considered. Whilst carbon sequestration was assumed \nto be zero in the arable system, some carbon is tied up in the tree component of SAF systems. \nCarbon sequestration was greater in fast growing species such as poplar than in the slow-\ngrowing species like walnut and wild cherry and especially holm oak, which was very slow \ngrowing. The very coarse assessment of the potential contribution of SAF to landscape \ndiversity showed greater impact in landscapes where currently arable farming was already \ndominant and where only few alternative habitats existed.  \nTo validate these preliminary conclusions and to take into account the variability of \nenvironmental and socio-economic conditions of landscapes and farms which could \npotentially adopt SAF systems, we will extend our approach to additional LTS in all three \ncountries, covering thus a gradient from Mediterranean to temperate Europe. Additionally, the \nresults will be linked to the profitability of SAF (Graves et al., 2007) to provide an integrated \nenvironmental and economic analysis of SAF. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nPart of this study was funded by the European Union 5th Framework (contract QLK5-2001-\n00560) and by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research (contract 00.0158).
