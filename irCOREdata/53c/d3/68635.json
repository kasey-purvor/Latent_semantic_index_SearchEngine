The effect of a high-frequency force on the response of a bistable system to a low-\nfrequency signal is considered for both the overdamped and weakly damped cases. It is shown that\nthe response can be optimized by an appropriate choice of vibration amplitude. This vibrational\nresonance displays many analogies to the well known phenomenon of stochastic resonance, but\nwith the vibrational force filling the role usually played by noise.\nStochastic resonance (SR) [1\u20133] is commonly said to occur when a weak periodic signal in\na nonlinear system is amplified by an increase in the ambient noise intensity. In this Letter,\nwe point out that an analogous phenomenon can occur when the noise is replaced by a high-\nfrequency periodic force\u2020. We will refer to it as vibrational resonance (VR). As we shall see,\nthere are some interesting distinctions, as well as close analogies, between VR and SR.\nSR is usually considered for the simplest possible example of an overdamped bistable\noscillator described by the equation\nx\u02d9 + f (x) = A cos\u03c9t + \u03be(t) (1)\nwhere A cos\u03c9t is the weak input signal, f (x) = dU(x)\/dx, U(x) is a symmetric double-\nwell potential (for example, U(x) = \u2212x2\/2 + x4\/4), \u03be(t) is white noise of intensity K , i.e.\n\u3008\u03be(t)\u03be(t + \u03c4) = K\u03b4(\u03c4). The response of the system to the input signal can be considered\neither in terms of a linear susceptibility [6] or, as here, in terms of an effective stiffness [7].\nSR occurs when the susceptibility or stiffness displays a nonmonotonic dependence on noise\nintensity, such that the response Q peaks at a particular value Km of the noise intensity K .\nThe complex amplitude B of the signal component s\u03c9(t) at frequency \u03c9 may be described by\nthe linearized equation\ni\u03c9B + c(A, \u03c9,K)B = A (2)\nwhere c(A, \u03c9,K) is a complex quantity. Its real part cr(A, \u03c9,K)may be treated as an effective\nstiffness [7], whereas its imaginary part ci(A, \u03c9,K) is proportional to what is effectively an\nadditional damping factor. For SR to occur, it is essential that c(A, \u03c9,K) should depend on\nthe noise intensity K .\nIt is evident, however, that a change in c(A, \u03c9,K) may be induced, not only by noise, but\nalso by other kinds of high-frequency force such as, for example, a periodic vibration. Such\na phenomenon would represent another example of a change in the dynamical behaviour\n\u2020 We use the original definition of SR [4] in terms of signal amplification, rather the later definition [5] in terms of\nan enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio.\nPublished in J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 33, L433\u2013L438 (2000).\nLetter to the Editor\nand properties of a nonlinear system induced by high-frequency vibration (see the book\nby Blekhman [8]). We first consider this possibility in relation to the overdamped bistable\noscillator\nx\u02d9 \u2212 x + x3 = A cos\u03c9t + C cos\u0014t (3)\ni.e. where the white noise \u03be(t) of (1) has been replaced by the rapidly oscillating periodic force\nC cos\u0014(t) with \u0014\u0004 \u03c9. We evaluate the response of the system to the input signal A cos\u03c9t\n(by analogy with a lock-in amplifier) by calculating the sine and cosine components, Bs and\nBc respectively, of the coordinate variations (output signal), yielding\nBs = 2\nnT\nnT\u222b\n0\nx(t) sin\u03c9t dt Bc = 2\nnT\nnT\u222b\n0\nx(t) cos\u03c9t dt (4)\nwhere T = 2\u03c0\/\u03c9 and n is an integer. Computing equation (3) and extracting the cosine and\nsine constituents of the output signal at frequency \u03c9, we thus find the dependences on C of\nboth the response amplitude Q = \u221aB2s + B2c \/A and the phase shift \u03c8 = \u2212 arctan (Bs\/Bc) of\nthe response relative to the input signal. Some results for a fixed value of \u0014 = 5 and different\nvalues of A and \u03c9 are plotted in figure 1.\nIt is immediately apparent from figures 1(a) and (b) that the form of Q(C) is qualitatively\nsimilar to what is seen in SR [1\u20133]: the response Q at first increases with increasing amplitude\nC of the high-frequency force, but then passes through a maximum and decreases again. The\nmaxima in Q(C) are in general sharper than are found in the case of SR. The phase shifts\n\u001b(C) are also reminiscent of those found in SR [9] but, again, exhibit very much sharper\nminima. For both Q(C) and \u001b(C), the positions of the extrema are weakly dependent on A\nand \u03c9 respectively, as shown in figure 1(c). The mechanism underlying VR can be understood\nas a reduction in the effective stiffness of the system induced by the high-frequency force [7],\nresulting in amplification of the low-frequency signal. Equivalently, it can be perceived in\nterms of changes in the depth of a smoothed auxiliary potential, as discussed earlier [10]\nfor a quasimonochromatic force: here, signal amplification occurs when the low-frequency\nsignal is first able to induce inter-well transitions; the nearly discontinuous rise in Q(C) with\nincreasing C corresponds to the minimum value of C at which the central maximum in the\nauxiliary potential can be destroyed at the peak signal values. The amplification decreases\nagain when the amplitude of the high-frequency vibrational force has increased sufficiently to\nannihilate completely the double-well character of the auxiliary potential (and that of the real\npotential over most of each forcing period).\nThere is a clear analogy between SR and VR in the simple overdamped systems (1) and (3)\nrespectively. We note that other authors have considered the effect of multi-frequency forces\napplied to nonlinear oscillators (see e.g. [11, 12]) but, to our knowledge, the phenomenon of\nvibrational resonance has not previously been identified or reported.\nIt is also of interest to establish whether VR arises in underdamped systems. As an\nexample, we consider the weakly damped bistable oscillator\nx\u00a8 + 2\u03b4x\u02d9 \u2212 x + x3 = A cos\u03c9t + C cos\u0014t. (5)\nOne example of a system described by (5) is a pendulum placed between the opposite poles\nof a magnet [13]. The change of c(A, \u03c9,C) with increasing amplitude of the high-frequency\nvibration means that the effective natural frequency of the oscillator described by equation\n(5) has to change too. It follows that the oscillator\u2019s response to the input signal A cos\u03c9t\nwill depend on the amplitude of the high-frequency vibration\u2014analogous to the \u2018tuning\u2019 of an\nunderdamped monostable oscillator to resonance by adjustment of the noise intensity in the\ncase of SR [14].\nLetter to the Editor\nFigure 1.

Some typical results are\npresented in figure 2 for different values of A and \u03c9. The variations of the response amplitude\nQ(C) and phase \u03c8(C) with the amplitude C of the high-frequency vibrational force shown in\nfigures 2(a) and (b) are markedly dependent on the signal frequency \u03c9, unlike the case of the\noverdamped oscillator (3) (cf figures 1(a) and (b)).\nFor \u03c9 close to the frequency of small free oscillations there are two resonances (figure\n2(b)), whereas for smaller \u03c9 there is only one resonance (figure 2(a)); the evolution with\nLetter to the Editor\nFigure 2.

This phenomenon is attributable to the \u2018tuning\u2019 of two different oscillatory\nprocesses: oscillations inside an individual well, and those involving jumps between wells.\nLetter to the Editor\nIf the signal frequency is too far from the intra-well free resonance, the intra-well oscillation\ncannot be brought into resonance by the high-frequency vibration, and so only one maximum\nof Q(C) is observed. Again, such behaviour is very similar to the case of stochastic resonance\nin a weakly damped bistable oscillator [7].\nFigures 3(a) and (b) illustrate the resonant dependences of the response Q(\u03c9) and phase\nshift \u03c8(\u03c9) on \u03c9 for a fixed value of A and different values of C. In contrast to the overdamped\noscillator (3), for a weakly damped oscillator these dependences are resonant in character, just\nas reported earlier for SR in the underdamped monostable oscillator [14]. As C increases, the\nresonant frequency at first decreases, but then increases again (see figure 3(c). Thus, we can\ncontrol the resonant frequency \u03c9r by changing the amplitude of the high-frequency vibration.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the phenomenon of vibrational resonance, in which a\nweak periodic signal can be optimally amplified by the application of high-frequency periodic\nforce of appropriate amplitude, can occur in both overdamped and underdamped nonlinear\noscillators. It can be perceived as a form of stochastic resonance in which the noise has been\nreplaced by a high-frequency periodic force.\nWe acknowledge valuable discussions with V I Babitsky, I I Blekhman, M I Dykman, R\nMannella and S M Soskin.
