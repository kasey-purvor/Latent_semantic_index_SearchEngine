The classification grouped the 900 km2 into eight urban land-8 \ncover classes. Input data to the classification algorithms were derived from spatial land 9 \ncover data obtained from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, and from the UK 10 \nOrdnance Survey. These data provided a description of each km2 in terms of the 11 \ncontributions to the land-cover of 25 attributes (e.g. open land, urban, villages, 12 \nmotorway, etc). The dimensionality of the land-cover dataset was reduced using 13 \nprincipal component analysis, and eight urban classes were derived by cluster analysis 14 \nusing an agglomeration technique on the extracted components. The resulting urban 15 \nland-cover classes reflected groupings of 1 km2 pixels with similar urban land 16 \nmorphology. Uncertainties associated with this agglomerative classification were 17 \ninvestigated in detail using fuzzy-type analyses. Our study is the first report of a 18 \nquantitative investigation of uncertainty associated with a classification of this type. The 19 \nresulting classification for the UK West Midland metropolitan area offers an impartial 20 \nbasis for a wide range of environmental and ecological surveys.

INTRODUCTION 5 \nUrban land classification introduction 6 \nLand classification is essential for geographers, planners, and, increasingly, for 7 \nenvironmental scientists. Lofvenhaft et al. (2002) remind us that there is \u201cno single 8 \ncorrect way to describe reality and solve practical questions\u201d regarding the classification 9 \nof land-cover, and that all classifications are subjective. Thus the quality of the 10 \nclassification depends on the skill of the interpreter even with globally applicable 11 \nclassification methods, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 12 \nNations (FAO, 2000) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS).  13 \nIn the urban context, land classification is useful in a wide range of applications 14 \nsuch as the study of urban land changes, urban ecology, illegal building development, 15 \nurban expansion, etc. Around 49% of the world\u2019s population live in metropolitan areas 16 \n(FAOSTAT, 2004), and in some countries, a much higher percent of the population are 17 \nconcentrated in towns and cities, e.g. ~80% for England (Seymour, 2001) and 93% for 18 \nAustralia (FAOSTAT, 2004). The analysis of urban environments is therefore of direct 19 \nrelevance to a large proportion of the world\u2019s population. 20 \nMany urban land classification systems have been based on interpretation of 21 \nsatellite imagery, which at one time was inadequate for urban applications, but has 22 \nundergone rapid and sophisticated improvement in recent years (e.g. Karathanassi et al., 23 \n2000; Barr and Barnsley, 2000; Zhang and Foody, 1998; Hepner et al., 1998; Xiao et al., 24 \n2004; Lo and Choi, 2004). There are also reports of detailed urban classification from 25 \n 4 \naerial photography. For example, Lofvenhaft et al. (2002) present a model to investigate 1 \nthe spatial aspects of biodiversity in urban planning for Stockholm, Sweden, based on the 2 \ninterpretation of colour infrared aerial photographs and laborious ground truthing. 3 \nLofvenhaft et al. (2002) conclude that urban planners sometimes have to deal with rapid 4 \nand large-scale changes, so their basis for planning (for example an urban land-use 5 \nclassification) must be easy to use, and can never be regarded as complete. Modern 6 \nsatellite and aerial images can give very high resolution detail of urban land cover, but for 7 \napplications requiring stratified sampling, aerial- and satellite-derived classifications need 8 \nto be processed further to provide integrated information. Stratified sampling is 9 \ncommonly used to obtain samples more representative of a population than simple 10 \nrandom sampling (e.g. Kaur et al., 1996). 11 \nIn the UK, there have been regular reviews of urban land-use by the UK 12 \ngovernment environmental departments: the Department of the Environment (DoE), the 13 \nDepartment of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), and now the 14 \nDepartment of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA; 2001-present) (e.g. 15 \nCoppock and Gebbett, 1978; Stamp, 1947; DETR, 2000). However, as far as we are 16 \naware, there has been no urban classification system designed for stratified sampling at 1 17 \nkm2 resolution which attempts to describe the morphological characteristics of urban land 18 \nwithin that 1 km2 pixel. Bunce and Heal (1984) estimated that about 10% of land in Great 19 \nBritain (GB) was \u201curban\u201d, but they made no analysis of the nature of different urban land 20 \ncover. They identified a need for stratified sampling strategies to improve databases for 21 \nenvironmental description at national level, and suggested an approach for such a strategy 22 \nbased on work by Bunce and Smith (1978). This was developed by Bunce et al. (1996a), 23 \nwho described the land classification derived by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE) 24 \n(now Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH)) of all 1 km-squares in Great Britain. 25 \n 5 \nAlthough this was a successful tool for classifying the GB rural land cover for botanical 1 \nsurvey (Bunce et al., 1996a), there were no detailed urban strata in the resulting 2 \nclassification. Therefore the method of Bunce et al. (1996a) was adapted in this study to 3 \nclassify the urban land comprising the UK West Midlands (UKWM) using land cover 4 \ndata stored as a raster dataset with Ordnance Survey coordinates.  5 \nThe classification process used principal component analysis to reduce 6 \ndimensionality of the input database and extract the dominant relationships between land-7 \nuse variables, followed by cluster analysis to aggregate 1 km2 pixels into classes. The 8 \nclassification that we generate differentiates between different grades of urbanisation, 9 \ngrouping together the most closely related 1 km2 pixels in the same class. These classes 10 \n(grades) of urbanisation then provide the basis for a range of applications that are not 11 \ndirectly measurable from aloft. For example, a particular stratified class may give 12 \ninformation about the amount of open space, open forest space and dwellings within any 13 \n1 km2 pixel belonging to that class. This relationship inherent within all pixels of the 14 \nsame class is not captured with non-stratified classification, and is important for a range 15 \nof applications, eg effects of different tree species on air quality or effects of urban 16 \nenvironment on child health.  Similarly, there are several applications where it is 17 \nimportant to classify urban land beyond a single \u201curban\u201d definition, for example in 18 \nboundary-layer atmospheric chemistry, where there are steep gradients in air pollutants 19 \nbetween heavy-industrial and suburban regions.  20 \n The aims and objectives of this paper are to develop a classification system for 21 \nthe UKWM region, and characterise it as fully as possible by (1) interpreting the principal 22 \ncomponents, (2) testing the robustness of the classification, and (3) exploring thoroughly 23 \nthe uncertainties associated with the classification process. This work was carried out as 24 \n 6 \npart of Lancaster University\u2019s contribution to the NERC Urban Regeneration and the 1 \nEnvironment (URGENT) programme  2 \n 3 \n2. METHODS 4 \n2.1 Generation of urban classification for the UK West Midlands Metropolitan 5 \narea 6 \nThe method used to generate the urban classification was adapted from that used to 7 \ngenerate a classification of the whole of GB (Bunce et al., 1996a), which was used for 8 \nthe CEH Countryside Information System (CIS) (http:\/\/www.cis-web.org.uk\/). An 9 \noverview of the methodology is shown in Figure 1. Quantitative spatial data were 10 \navailable at 1 km2 resolution for each of the 900 km-squares comprising the West 11 \nMidlands Metropolitan area in the UK (Table I; hereafter, km-square = \u201cpixel\u201d). These 12 \ndata were extracted from published sources (Crown Copyright Ordnance Survey; Fuller 13 \net al., 1994; and Wyatt et al., 1994.) and stored as tables in an EXCEL spreadsheet. 14 \nEach 1 km2 pixel occupied one row. The data consisted of 27 variables (\u201cattributes\u201d) 15 \nwhich occupied columns of the spreadsheet, with a value for each attribute for each of 16 \nthe 900 pixels. Twenty-five of the 27 attributes described land-cover (e.g. \u201curban\u201d, 17 \n\u201cmotorways\u201d, etc; Table I). The remaining two of the 27 attributes did not contribute to 18 \nland cover of the pixels, but were included as diagnostic attributes in the PCA. One of 19 \nthese was the first axis output from the CEH mean PCA values for the individual Land 20 \nClasses of the GB land classification (\u201cCIS axis 1\u201d). This was used as an integrated 21 \nenvironmental attribute for the urban land classification. The second diagnostic attribute 22 \n\u201cslope\u201d described the gradient of land within the pixel was obtained from CEH data 23 \nsources, and was included in case this physical parameter affected type of urban 24 \ndevelopment (e.g. housing rather than heavy industry). The 25 land-cover attributes 25 \n 7 \nshown in Table I were spatial land-cover data which contributed a certain number of 1 \nhectares to each 1 km2 pixel of the UKWM, ie, the attributes were expressed as ha km-2 2 \nland-cover in each pixel.  3 \nValues for the 27 attributes for each 1 km2 pixel were used in principal 4 \ncomponent analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis programs ('Minitab'; Minitab Inc., State 5 \nCollege, Pennsylvania, USA). In the PCA, extracting uncorrelated, orthogonal 6 \ncomponents (factors) reduced duplication in the variability of the 27 attributes across 7 \nthe 900 pixels. In this way ~45% of the variability of the 27 attributes was accounted for 8 \nby 6 extracted components (Table II). Further component extraction accounted for little 9 \nextra variability (Figure 2). The extracted components were then used in the cluster 10 \nanalysis. Euclidean distance was used as the dissimilarity matrix coefficient, and 11 \nWard\u2019s method was used to minimise the increase in the error in sum of squares 12 \n(variance) resulting from the clustering (Ward, 1963). This procedure uses an 13 \nagglomerative hierarchical method that begins with all 900 pixels being separate, each 14 \nforming its own \u201ccluster\u201d. In the first step, the two pixels closest together (defined by 15 \nthe dissimilarity matrix) are joined. In the next step, either a third pixel joins the first 16 \ntwo, or two other pixels join together into a different cluster. With Ward\u2019s method, 17 \nevery possible pair of pixels and existing clusters is tested iteratively, and the pair 18 \nwhose fusion results in the lowest increase of variance of the clusters are combined. 19 \nThis process continues until all clusters are joined into one, but output can be analysed 20 \nto yield any number of clusters or groups. Initial visual interpretation of the components 21 \nextracted from PCA (Table III) indicated that eight urban classes should be sufficient 22 \nfor the stratification of the 900 UKWM pixels (see below). The most widely used 23 \nprocedure for deciding on final number of classes in this type of analysis is to accept an 24 \nad hoc minimum size of group, guided by practicality and usability (Hall and Arnberg, 25 \n 8 \n2002; Bunce et al., 1996b). The minimum and maximum number of squares in this 1 \nUKWM classification were 7 and 218, respectively. Classes with large numbers could 2 \nnot be usefully subdivided, as they represented the extensive and homogenous farmland 3 \nand open light suburban areas of the region (section 3.1). Similar use of PCA and 4 \ncluster analyses have been reported by Huang et al. (2001) who classified energy flows 5 \nin an urban region, reducing dimensionality of their input datasets from 19 variables to 6 \nfour factors. Cifaldi et al. (2004) performed PCA on two contrasting regions, one 7 \nagricultural and one urban, to examine spatial patterns in land cover. The reduced the 8 \ndimensionality of their data-sets of 25 variables to 5 extracted components which 9 \naccounted for a large proportion of the variability in their original data. 10 \n 11 \n2.2 Validating the method of generating urban classes using principal component 12 \nand cluster analyses 13 \nThe methodology was checked using different PCA and cluster analysis programs in 14 \ntwo further software packages, \u201cClustan\u201d (Clustan Ltd., Edinburgh, Scotland) and 15 \n\u201cStatistica\u201d (Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA). Clustan is a Fortran program 16 \nrunning on a UNIX operating system. \u201cStatistica\u201d is a package available for Windows 17 \nPC (StatSoft inc). Statistica was unable to run with the complete original 900-line 18 \ndataset; therefore a subset of 300 lines was taken from the data file by extracting the 19 \nfirst, then every third line of data. PCA and cluster analysis programs were run to 20 \nproduce eight classes from the subset of data, using Minitab and Statistica, with 21 \nEuclidean distance and Ward\u2019s linkage. Minitab software generated the classification 22 \nsystem directly, with eight classes and six components defined for the output. Statistica 23 \noutput produced a cluster dendrogram, and an amalgamation schedule from which eight 24 \nclasses were extracted. The data for the dendrogram indicated the linkage distance of 25 \n 9 \nthe clusters that would result in 8 classes. Because the default dissimilarity coefficient 1 \nfor Clustan is squared Euclidean distance, a program was included in the Clustan syntax 2 \nto define Euclidean distance as the dissimilarity coefficient. After processing output 3 \ndata, identical classifications were obtained using Minitab, Clustan and Statistica. 4 \n 5 \n2.3 Analysis of uncertainty associated with the classification 6 \nAll land cover data contributing to the analysis of a region the size of the UKWM is 7 \nlikely to carry uncertainties, irrespective of its source. When integrating land cover data 8 \nto provide information at larger scales, more uncertainty is introduced as detail becomes 9 \nsacrificed to average. When applications demand ground-truthing, surveying or 10 \nsampling within a very large area, with view to extrapolating from the sampling domain 11 \nto the entire study domain, uncertainties can become very large indeed. With this in 12 \nmind, we undertook a rigorous analysis of uncertainty to make transparent the 13 \nunavoidable and inherent sources of error when using a stratified sampling system. 14 \n2.3.1 Calculating fuzzy membership of each urban land class for each pixel 15 \nThe vector of attribute values for any particular pixel will have some degree of 16 \nsimilarity with all 8 urban class centroid properties, and therefore have some degree of 17 \nmembership to each of the 8 urban classes. To estimate the degree of membership of 18 \neach pixel in each of the 8 urban classes, the Euclidean distance (dE) between the pixel 19 \nattribute vector, x, and that of each urban class mean (\u00b5c; Table IV) was calculated 20 \nusing:  21 \n( ) ( )\u2211\n=\n\u2212=\nn\nj\ncjjcE xxd\n1\n2\n, \u00b5\u00b5 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..(1) 22 \nwhere dE(x,\u00b5c) is the \u201cdistance\u201d between pixel x and the class centroid \u00b5c for class c, (xj-23 \n\u00b5cj) is the distance between pixel and class centroid for attribute j, and n = number of 24 \n 10 \nattributes. This measures the similarity between the pixel vector of attribute values, and 1 \nthe class vector of centroid attribute values (Ahamed et al., 2000). The \u201cdistance\u201d values 2 \n[dE(x,\u00b5c)] were used to calculate a vector of fuzzy class membership grades for each 3 \npixel using: 4 \n( ) ( )\n( )\u2211 =\n=\nm\ni\niE\ncE\nc\nxd\nxd\nxf\n1\n,\n1\n,\n1\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(2) 5 \nwhere fc(x) is the membership grade of pixel \u201cx\u201d in class \u201cc\u201d, with values between 0 and 6 \n1, dE(x,\u00b5c) are calculated in equation (1), and m = number of urban classes (Ahamed et 7 \nal., 2000). In this analysis, there are 8 urban classes (ie m=8), so a membership-grade 8 \nvector of 8 values is calculated for each pixel (Table V).  By definition, the sum of all 9 \nmembership values in a pixel\u2019s membership vector is 1. 10 \n2.3.2 Calculating uncertainty for pixel allocation to urban classes 11 \nZhu (1997) described 2 stages in classification of spatial phenomena: (1) class 12 \ndefinition and (2) class assignment. During class definition, the parameter space of a 13 \nspatial phenomenon is discretised into regions (classes) with each region assigned a 14 \nclass name and represented by a centroid of that region, which is often the typical case 15 \nfor that class (Zhu, 1997). In the general case, the pixel is assigned to only one class 16 \nbased on a comparison of the observed attribute and the typical attributes of the classes. 17 \nOnce the pixel is assigned to that class, it assumes the centroid (mean) properties of that 18 \nclass, and thus loses its individuality. The loss of pixel individuality is the error 19 \nintroduced into the final classification product (Zhu, 1997). Zhu (1997) postulated that 20 \nbecause no pixel is exactly identical to the class centroid in terms of attribute values, 21 \nwhen a pixel is assigned to a class, an error of commission (\u201cexaggeration uncertainty\u201d) 22 \nis made, by allocating centroid properties to a pixel that does not \u201cfully\u201d qualify for it. 23 \n 11 \nSimilarly, by allocating a pixel to a class, similarities between it and the other classes 1 \nare ignored, thus introducing an error of omission (\u201cignorance uncertainty\u201d).   2 \nThe classification method employed here does not pre-define class centroid properties, 3 \nbut generates them in the process of agglomeration. The centroid properties are then 4 \ndefined as the class means of the attributes, and the fuzzy membership functions 5 \ndescribed above are based on this process-derived centroid definition for each of the 8 6 \nurban classes. 7 \n2.3.3 Exaggeration Uncertainties 8 \nZhu (1997) describes exaggeration uncertainty as inversely related to the membership 9 \nsaturation in the class to which an object is assigned. Here we define an exaggeration 10 \nuncertainty vector for a pixel\u2019s possible assignation to each of the 8 urban classes. For 11 \nany pixel x, possible allocation to class c with centroid \u00b5c, carries an exaggeration 12 \nuncertainty which we define as: 13 \n[ ] ( )( )[ ]cE\ncE\ncc\nxd\nxd\nxE\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\u00b5\n,max\n,\n, = \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(3) 14 \nwhere Ec [ ]cx \u00b5,  is a measure of exaggeration uncertainty with values ranging between 0 15 \nand 1,  dE(x,\u00b5c) are calculated in equation (1) and max[dE(x,\u00b5c)] is the maximum value 16 \nof the distance dE(x,\u00b5c) from the centroid \u00b5c for pixels previously calculated to be in that 17 \nclass. By calculating E for possible assignation to each of the 8 urban classes, a vector 18 \nof class exaggeration uncertainty values was generated for each pixel (Table VI).  19 \n2.3.4 Ignorance Uncertainties 20 \nThe uncertainty associated with ignoring the similarities between a pixel and the classes 21 \nto which it was not allocated is related to the fuzziness of the pixel compared with the 22 \ndefinition of the class centroids (Zhu, 1997). The fuzzier a pixel\u2019s relationship to the 23 \nclasses, the more evenly distributed is the membership in the vector and the greater is 24 \n 12 \nthe ignorance uncertainty. Ignorance uncertainty can be defined in several ways, but a 1 \nmethod adopted by Zhu (1997) is based on the level of membership of a pixel in classes 2 \nto which it was not assigned. The sum of values in a pixel\u2019s membership vector is 1 3 \n(section 2.3.1 and equation (2)), therefore we define a measure of ignorance uncertainty 4 \n( ) ( )xfxI c\u2212= 1 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.(4) 5 \nwhere fc(x) is the membership value for the class to which a pixel x is assigned. \u0399(x) was 6 \ncalculated for each pixel, and the mean (Ic) and standard deviation calculated for each 7 \nclass (Table VII).   8 \n 9 \n3.  RESULTS 10 \n3.1 The urban land classification 11 \nThe distribution of Eigenvalues derived from the PCA is presented in Figure 2. 12 \nEigenvalues represent the relative contribution of each component to total variation in 13 \nthe data. Figure 2 shows clearly that most of the variation in the data was accounted for 14 \nby the first six components. The percentage of total variation explained by each 15 \ncomponent is calculated as (eigenvalue x 100\/number of attributes). Thus ~45% of the 16 \nvariability was accounted for by successive extraction of the first six components (Table 17 \nII). Eigenvectors are sets of scores representing the weighting of each of the original 18 \nland-cover attributes on each extracted component (Table III). The Eigenvector scores 19 \ngive information for the interpretation of the principal component analysis (Cifaldi et 20 \nal., 2004).  The first component (or factor) describes a gradient between (a) built-up and 21 \n(b) non built-up areas; the second component distinguishes between (a) wooded areas 22 \n\/heathland, and (b) farmed land; the third component, between (a) water\/bare ground, 23 \nand (b) suburban built-up areas; the fourth component, between (a) urban built-up 24 \nareas\/major transport corridors, and (b) suburban areas\/minor transport corridors; the 25 \n 13 \nfifth, between (a) wooded areas, and (b) heathland countryside; and the sixth between 1 \n(a) less dense built-up areas, and (b) major transport corridors (Table III). The extracted 2 \ncomponents\u2019 spectra of attribute weightings suggested, therefore, that eight classes 3 \nwould be an optimum number of classes to specify in the output from the cluster 4 \nanalysis, and that the classes would broadly reflect wooded areas, water, transport 5 \ncorridors, urban built-up areas, different density suburban built-up areas, open land, and 6 \nfarmland. Cluster analysis was then used to generate the classes, and class centroids 7 \nwere found by calculating the mean hectare-age of each of the 25 land-cover attributes 8 \nin each urban class (Table IV). The distribution and brief interpretation of urban classes 9 \nin the UKWM region is shown in the maps in Figure 3. The classes generated were 10 \nnamed subjectively according to their dominant centroid attributes (Figure 3; class 1 \u2013 11 \nvillages\/farms; class 2 \u2013suburban; class 3 \u2013 light suburban; class 4 \u2013 dense suburban; 12 \nclass 5 \u2013 urban\/transport; class 6 \u2013 urban; class 7 \u2013 light urban\/open water; class 8 \u2013 13 \nwoodland\/open land). Representative aerial view photographs of pixels representative of 14 \neach land class are shown in Figure 4 (Cities Revealed (R) photography \u00a9 1998 The 15 \nGeoinformation Group (R) Ltd). The interpretation of each class was confirmed by 16 \nvisual inspection of OS maps (1:50000, nos. 139 and 140).   17 \n  18 \n3.2 Fuzzy analysis of uncertainty of the urban land-cover classification 19 \n3.2.1 Fuzzy membership of each urban land class for each pixel 20 \nMean membership grade vectors for each class are presented in Table V. Figures in bold 21 \ndepict the mean membership value in the membership-grade vectors (fc) for the class to 22 \nwhich the member pixels are allocated.  For example, the average membership value of 23 \nclass 1 pixels for class 1 is 0.32\u00b10.10, which is higher than the average membership 24 \nvalues of these pixels for the other classes (Table V). 25 \n3.2.2 Exageration uncertainties 26 \n 14 \nMean exaggeration uncertainties are presented in Table VI. The bold figures describe 1 \nthe exaggeration uncertainty of allocating pixels to their own class, and the non-bold 2 \nfigures describe the exaggeration uncertainty of allocating pixels to other classes. Thus, 3 \nfor the pixel members of class 1, the mean exaggeration uncertainty associated with 4 \nassuming class 1 pixels possess the class 1 centroid properties is 0.20\u00b10.11. 5 \n3.2.3 Ignorance Uncertainties 6 \nTable VII lists the ignorance uncertainties for each class. For example, the mean 7 \nuncertainty associated with lost information about an individual pixel allocated to class 8 \n1 is 0.68\u00b10.10. This is lower than the mean exaggeration uncertainties associated with 9 \nallocating these pixels to any other class.    10 \n 11 \n4. DISCUSSION 12 \n4.1 The classification system 13 \nThe classification procedure reduced the number of input variables to the principal 14 \ncomponent analysis from 25 land-cover types to 6 factors, resulting in 8 urban 15 \nmorphology classes. The classification was robust in that different software packages 16 \ngenerated identical classifications based on the same input data. Mean class 17 \ncharacteristics were derived by interpreting the principal components (Table IV). While 18 \nthe characteristics of most classes are distinct, there is at first glance a close similarity 19 \nbetween classes 5 and 6. However, the distinction between class 5 and 6 is real. Class 5 20 \nis characterised by high density of transport corridors in an urban, rather than suburban 21 \nor rural environment. Class 6 is high density urban with few transport corridors. This 22 \ntype of distinction is important if we are considering eg communication, ecology 23 \ncorridors for encouraging biodiversity, linear sources of anthropogenic pollutant gases, 24 \ntree planting, etc. 25 \n 15 \n 1 \n4.2 Fuzzy membership of each urban land class for each pixel 2 \nAs described above, the vector of attribute values for any particular km2 \u201cpixel\u201d will 3 \nhave some degree of similarity with all 8 urban class centroid properties, and therefore 4 \nhave some degree of membership to each of the 8 urban classes. In theory, the largest 5 \nfuzzy class membership grade of the 8 urban classes for any individual pixel should 6 \ncorrespond to the urban class allocated to that pixel. In fact, there is a satisfactory 65% 7 \ncorrespondence for all pixels, between allocated class and largest value in the class 8 \nmembership vector. The remaining 35% non-correspondence highlights the difference 9 \nbetween the original clustering process (in which the mean properties of the cluster 10 \nchange as the cluster forms), and a post-hoc test using the final cluster-mean properties. 11 \nIn joining a new pixel to a growing class, it is possible that the pixel that minimizes 12 \noverall variance at that point in the agglomerative clustering process is not necessarily 13 \nthe pixel whose attribute values are nearest to the final class centroid.  14 \nExcept for class 7, the highest membership value in the average membership-15 \ngrade vectors (fc) is for the class to which the member pixels are allocated (Table V). 16 \nThe membership values in the average vector for class 7 are all very similar, indicating 17 \na very high degree of membership fuzziness for these pixels. These pixels were 18 \nclustered together in the analysis on the strength of the large area of inland water land-19 \ncover which these pixels share, but apart from inland water, their land-cover attribute 20 \ncomposition is similar to that of other classes. Figure 5A illustrates how a pixel can 21 \nhave different degrees of membership in more than one class.  22 \n 23 \n4.3 Exaggeration Uncertainties 24 \n 16 \nIndividual pixel exaggeration uncertainties associated with allocating each pixel to its 1 \nurban class ranged from 0.04 to 1.00. The fuzzy class vectors of the mean and standard 2 \ndeviation of the exaggeration uncertainties for each class ranged from 0.11\u00b10.05 to 3 \n0.50\u00b10.13 (bold type, Table VI). Surprisingly, allocation of a mean class-5 pixel to its 4 \nown class carries slightly higher mean exaggeration uncertainty than allocating the pixel 5 \nto class 6 (0.30\u00b10.15 cf 0.29\u00b10.17). Similarly, allocating a mean class 7 pixel to its own 6 \nclass carries exaggeration uncertainty (0.50\u00b10.13) equivalent to the exaggeration 7 \nuncertainty associated with allocating this square to some of the other classes. The 8 \nvalues of the mean class exaggeration uncertainty vectors are a relative measure of how 9 \nmuch each pixel is different from the centroid of its allocated class compared with how 10 \nmuch the same pixel is different from the centroids of other classes (Figures 5A, 5B). 11 \nAssuming that a feature we wish to ascribe to a class (e.g. biogenic emission rates, see 12 \nbelow) varies linearly with dE, exaggeration uncertainty can be interpreted as the extra 13 \nfalse pixel information acquired as each pixel in a class assumes the identity of the class 14 \ncentroid. This could be up to 50% (Table VI). Exaggeration uncertainties reflect the 15 \ncomplex nature and broad scope of land-cover within each class. 16 \n 17 \n4.4 Ignorance Uncertainties 18 \nIndividual mean class ignorance uncertainties range from 0.65\u00b10.11 to 0.87\u00b10.04 (Table 19 \nVII) and the overall average ignorance uncertainty is 0.73\u00b10.11. As for the exaggeration 20 \nuncertainties, ignorance uncertainty values are not absolute measures of uncertainty, but 21 \nindicate the amount of information lost when classifying pixels using the agglomerative 22 \ncluster analysis methodology, and assigning each pixel to a single class (Figures 5A, 23 \n5B). Again, this assumes a linear relationship between some feature assigned to the 24 \nclass and pixels\u2019 dE values. Although the results of the uncertainty analysis appear to be 25 \n 17 \ncause for concern, all comparable systems of stratification, whether in ecology, social 1 \nscience or environmental studies, have comparable problems. The most important 2 \nfeature to emerge from the analysis of uncertainty of the classification described here, is 3 \nthat the allocation of pixels to classes is satisfactory for practical purposes, even for 4 \nthose pixels with very fuzzy membership grade vectors. However, the cluster test with fc 5 \n(equation 2) broadly justifies the classes that have been formed using PCA and cluster 6 \ntechniques, but indicates that categorical statements regarding class membership, class 7 \nbehaviour and properties should be avoided.  8 \n 9 \n4.5 Specific Applications 10 \nThe classification can now be used as a structure for surveys and sampling, to answer 11 \nquestions such as \u201cWhat is the total tree cover in the UK metropolitan region and what 12 \nare the uncertainties associated with the estimates?\u201d; \u201cHow much space is available for 13 \nfuture tree planting in the UKWM?\u201d; \u201cWhat is the effect of the present and possible 14 \nfuture tree populations on air quality in the UKWM?\u201d. Given that the classification 15 \nmethodology can be applied to other metropolitan areas where gridded data is available, 16 \nthe same kind of questions may be addressed in metropolitan areas around the world. 17 \nThe classification described here has already been used in a desk study to 18 \nestimate biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions from the UKWM 19 \nconurbation (Owen et al., 2003). It has also been used in a field survey study to estimate 20 \ntree cover and tree biomass for the UKWM conurbation (Donovan, 2004), and in a 21 \nmodelling study to investigate the effect of pollutant deposition and biogenic VOC 22 \nemissions on air quality in the UKWM (Donovan et al, 2005). In the field study 23 \n(Donovan, 2004), a survey of trees in the UKWM was undertaken by stratified 24 \nrecording of all individual trees in sample plots in randomly selected 1 km2 pixels. A 25 \n 18 \ntotal of 22 pixels were surveyed, the number of squares sampled for each of the eight 1 \nurban land-cover classes was proportional to the area occupied by each class in the 900 2 \npixels comprising the UKWM. Data for each urban land-class pixel were extrapolated 3 \nto the total area of each of the classes in the UKWM to obtain an integrated estimate for 4 \nthe tree population for the whole region based on the survey work, rather than on 5 \npreviously published tree data (c.f. Owen et al., 2003). Because the sampling was 6 \nstratified, i.e. based upon the urban classification, there was compensation for the 7 \nrelatively small percentage of the total region that it was possible to sample with the 8 \navailable time and manpower. 9 \n 10 \n4.6 Wider Applications 11 \nThis type of urban land classification could facilitate first estimates of: 12 \n\u2022 overall land resources of an urban region. This would be useful for features 13 \nthat are not recorded on a systematic basis by other agencies and that are not a 14 \nsimple linear sum or difference of standard recorded features, e.g. area occupied 15 \nby transport corridors, commercial land suitable for tree planting. 16 \n\u2022 the distribution of land resources throughout urban classes. For example, 17 \nurban land class 5 is designated \u201curban\/transport\u201d here, and each UKWM pixel 18 \nwhich is classified as \u201curban\/transport\u201d has a mean of ~20 ha km-2 19 \ngrassland\/open land. This information could be of interest to planners, recreation 20 \nand amenity officers and conservation bodies, to conduct more detailed survey 21 \nof each pixel according to the application of interest (e.g. housing, creation of 22 \nplaying fields, new woodland planting etc) and to identify, for example, those 23 \n\u201curban\/transport\u201d squares whose proportion of open space is detrimentally low. 24 \n 19 \n\u2022 land-use potential.  Survey work based on the classification can identify further 1 \nland-use attributes for sample survey pixels (for example, future tree planting 2 \npotential, derelict sites, sites suitable for recreational development etc.), which 3 \ncan be extrapolated to the whole UKWM region. 4 \n\u2022 changes in the urban infrastructure. For example, removal of railway lines 5 \nfrom a pixel in class 5 (urban transport) will result in re-classification of that 6 \nsquare, bringing it into a class with less railway, but with other attributes similar 7 \nto class 5 (e.g. class 2; Table IV), and therefore subject to monitoring or policies 8 \nfor the new class. Of course, when pixel re-classification exceeds some 9 \nthreshold (e.g.10%), then the basis of the original classification becomes 10 \nobsolete and the region should be re-classified. The procedure described here 11 \nensures that updating the classification is a straightforward and time-efficient 12 \nprocess. 13 \n\u2022 policy options. For example, the classification provides an estimate of the 14 \nspatial distribution of high-density transport corridors (i.e. class 5 squares). It is 15 \ntherefore possible to make a first estimate of the concentration of associated 16 \nfeatures and potential facilities (e.g. lighting, street tree planting, pollutant 17 \nemissions), and their costs, without resorting to detailed survey in the first 18 \ninstance.  19 \n\u2022 assessment and costings for scaling-up policies. Classification of urban land-20 \nuse for all major cities would assist planners and policy-makers in the task of 21 \nlarger-scale assessments and costings. 22 \nThese are examples of the wide range of potential applications for an urban land-cover 23 \nclassification system, of interest and use to Local Authority planners, property 24 \ndevelopers, environmental researchers, utility companies and policy makers. The 25 \n 20 \nclassification system described here is \u201crobust enough\u201d, and useful for stratified 1 \nsampling and extrapolation where time and resources are scarce. It is easy to apply to 2 \nother UK conurbations, and indeed to any region for which there exists a spatial dataset 3 \nconsisting of attribute data to describe the component land-covers of each pixel. It is 4 \nalso easy to reapply using updated datasets, to monitor land-use changes at pixel and 5 \nregional scales. 6 \n 7 \n5. CONCLUSIONS 8 \nWe generated a successful classification system for the UKWM region using land cover 9 \ndata stored as a raster dataset with Ordnance Survey coordinates. Our approach is 10 \nsupported by other workers who have also used PCA and cluster analyses to generate a 11 \nclassification relevant to urban land-cover (e.g. Huang et al., 2001; Cifaldi et al., 2004).  12 \nWe believe that this is the first time that an attempt to quantify uncertainties has 13 \nbeen presented alongside an agglomerative land-cover classification. The same analysis 14 \nof uncertainty could be applied to any application of PCA and clustering in landscape 15 \nscience, with similar uncertainty results. In view of the process of agglomeration and 16 \nthe associated errors, we expected a very large degree of uncertainty associated with the 17 \nclassification and therefore the results of the uncertainty analyses were encouraging.  18 \nThe methodology is statistically robust and reproducible and enables standard 19 \nerrors to be estimated. By including a posteriori tests of the classification, its limits 20 \nbecome more clearly defined, and the tendency to make categorical statements based on 21 \nthe classes is reduced. The statistical procedures used can vary according to the 22 \navailability of algorithms in PCA packages. Even though the decision about the number 23 \nof classes to allow the cluster analysis to generate is subjective, the principal feature of 24 \nour approach is the use of objective procedures to construct the classification, and to 25 \n 21 \nfacilitate subsequent estimation of environmental parameters.  Similar data for the 1 \ngeneration of an urban land classification are available in most European countries so 2 \nthat the approach could be adapted to many other situations. 3 \n 4 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 5 \nWe acknowledge the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) for funding the 6 \nresearch as part of the NERC program \u201cUrban Regeneration and the Environment 7 \n(URGENT)\u201d.  8 \n 9 \nREFERENCES 10 \nAhamed, T.R.N., Rao, K.G. and Murthy, J.S.R., 2000.

During the process of clustering, it is likely that the pixel will be \nallocated to class 2, whose centroid is \u201ccloser\u201d to the pixel. However, pixel X \nmay be allocated to class 1 if, early in the clustering process, it is linked with \nnearby pixels which form a cluster which is nearer to \u00b51, than to \u00b52 (small cluster \ndelineated within dashed line). All pixels have some degree of membership in \neach of the generated urban classes. Generally, a pixel is allocated to the class \nwhose centroid is closest. After allocating to a class, the pixel assumes the \ncharacteristics of the class centroid. This results in an exaggeration uncertainty \ndue to false pixel information acquired (solid arrows), and an ignorance \nuncertainty due to loss of individual pixel information (dashed arrows). Further \nexplanation of these uncertainties is illustrated in Figure 5B below. \n\u00b51 \n \nA1 \nB1 \nC1 \nD1 \nE1 \nF1 \nG1 \n \n\u00b52 \n \nA2 \nB2 \nC2 \nD2 \nE2 \nF2 \nG2 \nX \n \nA1 \nB1 \nc \nd \nE2 \nF2 \nG2 \nFigure 5B Exaggeration and Ignorance uncertainties in terms of centroid and pixel \nattributes.

Pixel X has similar values to \u00b51 for \nattributes A and B, and similar values to \u00b52  for attributes E, F and G. \nExaggeration uncertainties associated with allocating pixel X to classes 1 and \n2, respectively, are represented by the attribute values enclosed in the solid line \nboxes. Ignorance uncertainties associated with allocating pixel X to classes 1 \nand 2, respectively, are represented by the pixel X attribute values enclosed in \nthe dashed line box (for class 1 allocation ) and in the dot-dash line box (for \nclass 2 allocation). \nClass 1 Class 2 \n\u00b51 \n\u00b52 X \n 38 \nAuthor biographies:   1 \nSusan (Sue) M.
