Introduction \nThe naturally occurring element selenium (Se) is of interest because it is essential to human \nand animal health in trace amounts (Lower Reference Nutrient Intake = 40 \u00b5g day-1; DOH, \n1991) but can be harmful in excess (safe upper intake level = 450 \u00b5g day-1; EVM, 2003). In \nhumans and animals, approximately 25 essential selenoproteins have been identified and \ndietary-Se is important because the element plays a key role in a number of metabolic \nprocesses, including; antioxidant systems, thyroid hormone metabolism, immune function \nand reproduction.  Selenium deficiency has also been implicated in a number of conditions \nincluding heart disease, cancer and HIV-AIDS (WHO, 1996; Rayman, 2005; Reilly, 2006; \nNavarro-Alarcon and Cabrera-Vique, 2008; Rayman, 2008). In animals, clinical signs of Se-\ndeficiency include reduced appetite\/growth\/fertility and muscle weakness; generally \ndescribed as white muscle disease (WMD) (Levander, 1986). In most cases, food forms the \nmain source of Se for humans because concentrations in water and air are generally low \n(WHO, 1987; Fordyce, 2005; Fordyce, 2007; Johnson et al., 2010).  \n \nThe concentration of Se in foodstuffs depends primarily upon the Se concentration of the soil \non which the raw food was grown or reared (Fleming, 1980; WHO, 1987; Fordyce, 2005). In \nmany soils, geology has a fundamental control on the distribution of Se, as rocks form the \nparent materials from which soils are derived via the process of weathering. The Se \nconcentration of most soils is very low 0.01 - 2 mg kg-1 (world mean 0.4 mg kg-1) but high \nconcentrations of up to 1200 mg kg-1 have been reported in some seleniferous areas \n(Fleming, 1980; Jacobs, 1989; Neal, 1995; Fordyce, 2005). Selenium bioavailability to plants \nand animals in soils is a function of the underlying geology, soil pH, redox conditions, \namounts of organic matter, competing ionic species such as sulphate, microbial activity, soil \ntexture, compaction and mineralogy, soil temperature, level of rainfall during the growing \nseason, irrigation, etc. High soil organic matter, Fe-oxyhydroxide and clay mineral content \n(all of which can adsorb or bind Se to the soil) can inhibit the uptake of Se into plants and \nanimals. Selenium in the form of selenate(6+) is more mobile, soluble and less-well adsorbed \n 3\nin soils than the organic forms selenomethionine and  selenocysteine or the more reduced \ninorganic forms selenite(4+); elemental-Se(0) or selenide(2-). Therefore, oxidising, alkaline \nconditions that favour the formation of selenate improve bioavailability, whereas selenite and \nselenide formed under reducing acid conditions are less bioavailable (Fleming, 1980; \nJacobs, 1989; Neal, 1995; Fordyce, 2005).  Total soil-Se concentrations < 0.6 mg kg-1 are \ngenerally considered indicative of deficiency for livestock production, as these are the \nconcentrations found in regions where Se-deficient livestock are commonplace, such as New \nZealand, Denmark and the Atlantic Region of Canada (Fordyce, 2005).  \n \nIn addition to the complex relationships governing Se uptake from soil, different species of \nplants and animals also assimilate Se to varying degrees. Plants can be divided into three \ngroups: Se-accumulators, secondary Se-accumulators and non-accumulators. Non-\naccumulators rarely assimilate more than 100 mg kg-1 Se (dry weight), whereas Se-\naccumulators can contain up to 40 000 mg kg-1 Se (dry weight) when grown in seleniferous \nenvironments (Jacobs, 1989; Neal 1995). Some common crops are secondary Se-\naccumulators; for example, Brassica species (rapeseed, calabrese (broccoli), cabbage) and \nAllium species (garlic, onions, leeks and wild leeks). Cereal crops such as wheat, oats, rye \nand barley are non-accumulators (WHO, 1987; Broadley et al., 2006). Forage crops \ncontaining < 40 \u00b5g kg-1 Se are generally associated with deficiency in grazing animals \n(Levander, 1986). In animals, Se tends to concentrate in the liver, kidneys and, to a lesser \nextent, in the muscle (Levander, 1986; WHO 1987).  Hence, offal, red meat and poultry were \nidentified as good sources of Se in the 2006 UK Total Diet Survey (TDS) along with fish, \nBrazil nuts, bread and cereals (FSA, 2009). \n \nIn Scotland, as in the rest of the UK, there is evidence that Se intake has been declining in \nrecent years. Concentrations of Se in the Scottish diet fell by 50% between 1974 and 1994 \nfrom 60 to 32 \u00b5g day-1 (Macpherson et al, 1997). This fall was reflected in the Se status of the \nScottish population, which dropped by 42%, from 1.50 \u00b5mol L-1 in 1985 to 0.86 \u00b5mol L-1 \n 4\nblood plasma Se in 1994. Data from the most recent National Diet and Nutrition Survey \n(Ruston et al., 2004) also suggested that the Se status of the Scottish population (women \n1.07 \u00b5mol L-1 and men 1.09 \u00b5mol L-1 blood plasma Se) was marginally lower than the rest of \nthe UK but the number of participants in Scotland was small. The decline in Se intake is \npartly attributed to falling intakes of red meat\/ offal but is primarily linked to changes in the \nsources of bread-making wheat from North America to the UK and Europe (Macpherson et \nal., 1997).  Canadian and American wheat tends to contain more Se, as it is grown over \nblack shale and volcanic tuff rock types on the prairies, which are rich in the element. In \ncontrast, wheat from the UK is lower in Se as Se-rich rock types and soils are less common; \nand acid-neutral soils are typical as in much of Northern Europe (Fordyce, 2005; Broadley et \nal., 2006; Johnson et al., 2010).   \n \nAlthough there is no existing national soil-Se geochemical dataset for Scotland to indicate \nthe range of Se concentrations across the country; it is recognised that the Se status of \nScottish soils is likely to be low due to their acid nature, geological parent materials and the \nclimate (Fordyce, et al., 2008).  If the Se status of Scottish soils is low and this is reflected in \nthe foodstuffs produced on them, then current moves towards the procurement of locally-\nproduced foods (Scottish Government, 2009) may have a potentially deleterious impact on \nthe Se status of the general population in Scotland.  \n \nTherefore, this initial study was designed to establish whether, in the absence of a soil-Se \ndataset for Scotland, it would be possible to use existing information on the underlying \ngeological parent materials to predict the Se status of the overlying soil, and of the foodstuffs \nproduced on it. It was also designed to provide a preliminary indication of the differences in \nSe concentration between soils and foodstuffs in predicted high and low-Se areas and \nwhether it was possible to measure these accurately. In addition, the project collected data \nregarding factors that have a significant influence over the agricultural utilisation of soil-Se, \ne.g., soil pH and organic matter content and water-soluble-Se content. As such, this study \n 5\ndid not aim to provide a representative survey of the Se concentration of Scottish soils and \nfood products, because the samples were limited in number and spatial extent. However, \nfrom these data, it was hoped that the sponsors (Food Standards Agency Scotland) would \ngain an insight into the relationship between the Se content of Scottish soil and locally \nproduced foods. It also provided information on the feasibility of using a similar experimental \ndesign to perform more widespread assessments of the Scottish Se status, prior to \nformulating future policies.  \n \n2. Selection of High and Low Selenium Areas for the Present Study \nInformation on the Se status of the Scottish environment is limited but the data available \nsuggest that it is likely to be low in Se. Historically, WMD in animals has been reported in \nseveral areas of Scotland, due to the generally low-Se status of the Scottish environment. In \na study of trace element deficiencies in animals across Scotland, SARI (1982) reported that \n80% of cattle not given Se supplements had blood-Se concentrations considered to be \ndeficient (< 0.64 \u00b5mol L-1). Adams et al. (2002) also presented evidence that the Se \nconcentration of Scottish wheat (< 40 \u00b5g kg-1) was lower than other parts of the UK, such as \nthe major wheat producing region of East Anglia (40 to more than 60 \u00b5g kg-1). \n \nVery few previous studies have been carried out into the Se concentrations of Scottish soils. \nUre et al. (1979) reported total Se concentrations of 0.02 to 0.36 mg kg-1 in 10 arable top \nsoils selected from different parent material types. MacLeod et al. (1996) reported total Se \nconcentrations of 0.55 to 0.76 mg kg-1 in four arable top soils in Aberdeenshire. However, \ndue to differences in analytical methodology, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the Se \nconcentration of particular soil types from these very limited studies.  \n \nAs part of the British Geological Survey\u2019s (BGS) Geochemical Baseline Survey of the \nEnvironment (G-BASE) project peri-urban\/rural soil samples were collected at a sample \ndensity of 1 per 2 km2 around the Glasgow conurbation. Total-Se concentrations in the 241 \n 6\nrural top soils ranged from 0.10 to 6.60 mg kg-1 (Figure 1). However, the uppermost \nconcentrations reported in this dataset were associated with contamination on the periphery \nof the urban environment and concentrations in \u2018natural\u2019 soils around Glasgow were \nestimated to range between 0.10 and 2.00 mg kg-1 (Fordyce et al., 2010).  \n \nA recent study (Shand and Hillier; 2009) of total Se (aqua regia digest) concentrations in 44 \nScottish agricultural soils over various geological parent materials reported values in the \nrange 0.19 to 1.46 mg kg-1 (mean 0.63 mg kg-1). However, these data were publically \navailable only after the end of the current project; hence were not included in the project \ndesign stage. \n \nGiven the small size of the Ure et al. (1979) and MacLeod et al. (1996) studies and the \nspecific geographic focus of the G-BASE Glasgow project; it was not possible to define high \nand low-Se soils across Scotland for the present study on the basis of known Se \nconcentrations. Therefore, a scheme was devised that utilised existing geological and \ngeochemical knowledge to rank various rock types as being either high or low-Se soil parent \nmaterials. No rock Se data were available for Scotland, but from studies around the world it \nwas known that sedimentary rocks tend to contain more of the element than igneous rocks. \nHowever, concentrations in most limestones and sandstones rarely exceed 0.05 mg kg-1. \nSelenium is often associated with the clay fraction in sediments, and is found in greater \nconcentrations in shales (0.06 mg kg-1) than limestones or sandstones. Coals and other \norganic-rich deposits can be enriched in the element, relative to other rock types, typically \nranging from 1 to 20 mg kg-1. However, values of over 600 mg kg-1 have been reported in \nsome black shales, with exceptionally high concentrations being reported in Se-rich coals in \nChina (6000 mg kg-1) (Plant et al., 2004; Fordyce, 2005).  \n \nWithin the main agricultural production regions of Scotland, 2000 different rock types were \nidentified using the BGS DiGMapGB-50\u00ae solid geology database for Scotland. These were \n 7\nclassified as predicted high or low-Se soil parent materials (Table 1) based on typical Se \nconcentrations in various rock types from around the world and the limited soil-Se data \navailable for Scotland. Note: the terms \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 refer to concentrations relative to each \nother, rather than predicting the absolute concentration of Se in a soil (Fordyce et al., 2008). \nThis information was incorporated into a geographic information system (GIS) where it was \nused to select farms for the study. Since many factors, not just the underlying geology, affect \nthe concentration of Se in an overlying soil, the prediction of high\/low-Se areas was subject \nto significant levels of uncertainty. \n \n3. Methods \n3.1 Project design \nThe following food commodities were chosen for this study because they were both widely-\ngrown and locally-consumed in Scotland: wheat, potatoes, calabrese (broccoli), cow\u2019s milk \nand beef steak (including grass from the fields in which the milk and beef cattle were \ngrazing). However, due to the lack of existing data on soil and foodstuff Se contents in \nScotland, the likely differences between high and low-Se concentrations, and ability to \nmeasure these accurately in the foodstuffs, was unknown prior to the project. Therefore, for \nthe purposes of this initial study, a controlled approach was adopted to compare the Se \nconcentrations in each of the food types and associated soils from a pair of farms; one in a \npredicted low-Se area and one in a predicted high-Se area. Since this project design would \ngive very limited information on the geographical variability of Se concentrations across \nScotland; a larger soil and foodstuff dataset was collected also for one of the food \ncommodities: potatoes. Therefore, the project was organised into two sections; one testing in \ndetail the ability to measure relationships between soil-Se and foodstuff-Se grown on \nindividual farms in areas of predicted high and low-Se. This was the main aspect of the \nstudy, and will be referred to as the Main Study. The second section of work designed to \nevaluate the variability in soil-Se and foodstuff-Se in predicted high and low-Se environments \nover a wider geographical area, based on potato sampling, is referred to as the Between-\n 8\nFarm Study. Potatoes were chosen for this aspect of the project as they were easy to collect, \nand widely grown across Scotland.  \n \n \n3.1.1 Calculation of replicate sampling numbers: \nThe number of replicate samples required to asses differences between \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 soil-\nSe and foodstuff samples in both the Main and Between-Farm Studies was determined using \na statistical power calculation assuming a \u2018power\u2019 of 80% and a statistical significance level \nof 5% (Thomas, 1997). Based on experience from the extensive food survey work \nundertaken at the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) over the last 20 years, the \ncalculation assumed that the Se concentration data for the soils and foodstuffs would have \naspects of inherent variability, ranging from 5% (representing the analytical\/sample variation) \nto 60% (incorporating possible farm\/site and commodity\/variety variation). Therefore, to \nminimise variability resulting from the latter source, replicate samples of a single variety of \neach food commodity were taken from individual farms, in the predicted high and low-Se \nareas. Figure 2 is a graphical representation of the calculation output, showing that, to detect \na two-fold difference in Se concentrations in food from predicted high and low soil-Se areas, \nwith a moderate level of variation (35%) in the overall precision, eight samples would be \nrequired for each food commodity, per Se area for the Main Study. The statistical power \ncalculation also indicated a dataset size of 18 was required to accurately assess Between-\nFarm variability. Therefore, additional sets of potatoes, and soils, were collected from a \nfurther 17 farms (in both the predicted high and the low soil-Se areas, i.e., 17 x 2 = 34 \nsamples) for the Between-Farm Study. The project design is summarised in Table 2. \n \n3.2 Identification of suitable farms \nUsing information from the Scottish Agricultural Census Database (Scottish Government, \n2008), a total of 10 farms were selected for the Main Study \u2013 five in predicted high-Se areas \nand five in predicted low-Se areas. For the Between-Farm Study, 17 farms were selected for \n 9\neach Se environment. Figure 3 shows a map of the sampling sites and predicted high and \nlow-Se areas.  \n \n3.3 Commodity selection and sample collection \n3.3.1 Main Study \nTo minimise sources of variability, other than predicted Se environment; crop variety; crop \nmaturity; breed of animal; age of animal; and cut of beef collected from the cattle, were \nstandardised. The calabrese variety, Parthenon, was selected as it is widely grown in \nScotland. Similarly, Maris Piper was selected as it is the most common potato variety grown \nfor human consumption in Scotland, (SASA, unpublished data). A widely grown variety of \nbiscuit-making winter wheat (Consort) was selected for the study (Struthers, 2007). Lean fillet \nAberdeen Angus beef steak was selected to minimise differences in Se concentration \nbetween fat and muscle in the meat cut. The cattle were 20 to 24 months old at slaughter. \nBoth of the dairy farms included in the study had herds of Friesian\/Holstein-cross cows. \nSamples of milk were collected in August from both farms.  \n \nTo minimise sources of variability further, the eight replicate samples of soils and each food \ncommodity were collected from the same field on each farm. However, within each field, \nsamples were collected from as wide a distribution as possible across the field. On the dairy \nfarms, the soil and grass samples were collected from the field grazed by the cattle in the \nprevious 24 hours prior to milk sampling to capture the rapid turnaround of Se from grass \nintake into cows\u2019 milk. On the beef farms, the soil and grass samples were collected from the \nfield grazed prior to cattle slaughter, within 0-3 months of slaughter and not beyond 6 months \nfrom slaughter. \n \nSamples of top soil (5-20 cm depth) were collected using a Dutch hand-held auger. Each soil \nsample comprised 5 auger-heads of soil. In the case of the wheat, calabrese and potato \nfarms, soils were collected directly from the root-base of the plant sampled for the study. In \n 10\nthe case of dairy and beef farms each soil sample comprised five auger-heads taken from \nthe centre and corners of a 2 x 2 m square. Namely, from eight 2 x 2 m squares distributed \nwidely across each pasture field.  \n \nGrass samples were collected from the same 2 x 2 m squares as the soil samples, by \nclipping the grass with clean scissors. All soil contamination was shaken off the vegetation \nbefore being placed in the sample bag. Grass samples were collected from dairy pasture at \nthe same time as milk collection. Grass from beef pasture sites was collected in early \nautumn, prior to cattle slaughter. Soil-splash was not removed from the grass samples, as it \nwas deemed important to obtain an indication of the total amount of Se being consumed by \nthe cattle. However, root material was not included. \n \nThe ears of wheat from one plant; individual heads of calabrese and individual potato tubers \ncomprised a single sample of each of these food types. Care was taken to ensure that the \nheads, in the case of calabrese, and tubers, in the case of potatoes, were of similar size in \nthe predicted low and high-Se farms and that all crops were sampled at maturity, just prior to \nharvest. Only potato tubers of 45-65 mm diameter were collected, in order to reduce potential \nSe concentration differences arising from different skin-to-flesh ratios. Milk (60-100 mL) was \ncollected directly from freshly-washed teats of eight different cows on each farm. Single cuts \nof fillet steak (150-200 g) were collected from carcasses at the local abattoir from eight \ndifferent cows from each farm. All samples were subjected to rinsing off soil, air-drying and \nchilling prior to being distributed to the laboratory. \n \n3.3.2 Between-Farm Study \nCrop variety and maturity were also standardised for the Between-Farm potato study. \nHowever, it was not possible to identify enough farms growing the Maris Piper variety to give \na large enough dataset. Therefore, both Maris Piper and Saxon varieties were included in the \nproject. Saxon was selected as the second variety as it produces tubers of comparable size \n 11\nto Maris Piper and is widely grown in Scotland (SASA, unpublished data). Equivalent \nnumbers of the two varieties were collected from each Se area. At each of the 34 Between-\nFarm sites (17 farms in each Se area), one composite soil and one composite potato sample \nwas collected.  \n \nAt each farm, top soil (5-20 cm depth) was collected using a Dutch hand-held auger. The \ncomposite comprised eight auger-heads of soil collected from the base of each of the eight \npotato plants selected for study. Soil from the eight auger-heads was thoroughly \nhomogenised on a plastic sheet, before collection in a Kraft\u00ae paper bag.  \n \nEight potato tubers were collected from different plants from the same field on each farm. \nAny adhering soil was washed off, and the tubers were dried prior to storage. These eight \ntubers were combined (including skins) to create a single sample from each farm.  \n \nDuring the farm-survey process, a questionnaire was completed which contained information \nregarding; land usage (including fertiliser and pesticide application); previous field usage; \nplant\/animal variety; final market for the food commodity and observations on soil conditions. \n \n3.4 Soil sample analysis \nFollowing air-drying (<30 \u00baC to avoid volatilisation of Se) and sieving (<2 mm nylon mesh) \nsoil samples were analysed for pH; loss-on-ignition (LOI) (as an indicator of organic matter \ncontent); total-Se (aqua regia digestion) and water-soluble Se. As outlined in the Introduction \nof this paper, the uptake of Se from the soil into plants and animals is influenced by many \nbiogeochemical processes. Therefore, the water-soluble soil-Se concentration was \ndetermined, as a measure of the most mobile or bioavailable (to plants and animals) portion \nof Se in the soil. However, it should be noted that it may not reflect the entire bioavailable Se \nconcentration of the soil. Soil pH and LOI also exert fundamental controls on the amount and \nbioavailability of Se in soil and so these parameters were also included in this study. \n 12\n 3.4.1 Total soil-Se analysis \nAgate-ball-milled soil (< 150 \u00b5m; 1 g) was weighed into a calibrated test-tube (50 mL), and \ndeionised water (5 mL) added, followed by aqua regia (3 HCl + 1 HNO3) (5 mL). The mixture \nwas left overnight and refluxed (160 \u00baC, at least 2 hours) prior to the cooled solution being \nmade up to volume with deionised water. Each analytical batch was accompanied by reagent \nblanks and certified reference materials (CRMs). Total Se quantification was by Inductively \nCoupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), using standard operating conditions.  \n \n3.4.2 Water-soluble soil-Se analysis \nAgate-ball-milled soil (< 150 \u00b5m; 3 g) was weighed into a calibrated test tube (50 mL), and \ndeionised water (30 mL) added. The mixture was shaken on an orbital shaker (12 hours) and \nthen centrifuged (3000 rpm). An aliquot (10 mL) of supernatant was transferred to a test-tube \nand acidified with a nitric acid: hydrochloric acid solution (1: 0.5% v\/v). Each analytical batch \nwas accompanied by reagent blanks and CRMs (although the latter in solids are only \ncertified for total Se, these were included in the water-soluble Se analysis as an in-\nhouse\/within-project quality control material). Analysis of the Se concentration was by ICP-\nMS, using standard operating conditions.  \n \n3.4.3 Soil pH \nSieved soil (10 g, <2 mm) was added to a calcium chloride solution (25 mL, 0.01M \nCaCl2.2H2O). The mixture was shaken to form a slurry prior to analysis by pH electrode. This \nmethod of pH determination generally gives lower results (0.5 pH units) than water-based \nmethods (Rowell, 1994), but is widely used in environmental science. The soil pH analysis \nwas performed using United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) accredited procedures. \n \n3.4.4 Loss-on-ignition (LOI) \n 13\nAgate-ball-milled soil (< 150 \u00b5m; 2 g) was heated in a furnace (450 \u00b0C, minimum of 4 hours). \nThe change in weight of the samples before and after heating was deemed to be the LOI.  \n \n3.5 Food and grass analysis \nPrior to homogenisation, the wheat grain was air dried; soil was rinsed from the calabrese \nand potatoes; and fat removed from the beef. Calabrese heads were trimmed (as for \nconsumption) and the potatoes homogenised (including skins). \n \n3.5.1 Total Se food and grass analysis \nAn aliquot (0.5 g dry, 3 g liquid) was dissolved in concentrated nitric acid (5 mL), using a \nmicrowave-assisted digestion system. Following cooling, the digest liquor was transferred to \na graduated test-tube (10 mL), and made up to volume with deionised water. An aliquot (0.3 \nmL) of this solution was diluted (to 5 mL) with a mixture of propan-2-ol (5% v\/v) and nitric \nacid (2% v\/v) containing In (as an internal standard, for instrumental drift correction). Each \nanalytical batch was accompanied by reagent blanks, spiked samples and CRMs. Total Se \nquantification was by ICP-MS, using standard operating conditions. All aspects of the \nanalysis were performed using UKAS-accredited procedures.  \n \n3.6 Statistical analysis  \nStatistical processing and presentation of the data generated by the project was carried out \nusing Excel\u00ae, Statview\u00ae and R statistical software. Prior to statistical analysis, preliminary \ndata exploration was carried out to demonstrate that no transformation was required to make \nthe data satisfy the assumptions of the proposed statistical techniques. Two-sided t-tests, \nwith pairwise testing and false discovery rate (FDR) multiple comparison correction were \nused to compare the data from predicted high and low-Se areas. FDR is a less conservative \nprocedure for comparison, with greater power than familywise error rate control (Storey, \n2002). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a stepwise model selection based on \nAkaike Information Criterion (AIC) were used to quantify the relationships between the Se \n 14\nconcentrations measured in the various foodstuffs and grass samples, and the various soil \nparameters. Pearson correlation tests with FDR correction were used to assess relationships \nbetween the four soil parameters. In order to quantify the effects of soil parameters, bivariate \nlinear regression analysis was used. The regression residual structure was evaluated \ngraphically using appropriate diagnostic plots (Crawley, 2003). Adjusted R2 was documented \nto measure the goodness of fit of the linear regression model. \n \nFor the purposes of data processing; the mean values for the parameters determined in the \nsoils from each of the Main Study farms were incorporated into the Between-Farm soil \ndataset. This increased the number of soil results in the combined Between-Farm dataset to \n44 (10 Main Study farm results and 34 Between-Farm soils). Similarly, the mean total Se \nconcentrations in potatoes from the two Main Study farms were included in the Between-\nFarm dataset resulting in 36 values in total (18 from each Se area). \n \n \n4. Results and discussion \n4.1 Analytical data quality \nTo allow a direct comparison to be made of the quantitative Se concentrations reported in \nthis paper against that from other sources, the quality assurance\/control data obtained during \nthis study are presented in Table 3.  The results demonstrated good accuracy and precision \nof the analytical methods.  \n  \n4.2 Overview of project results \n4.2.1 Soil \nIn order to ensure that inferences being made from the Between-Farm soil-Se data had not \nbeen influenced by the choice of food commodity, the farmer questionnaires were \ninterrogated for information regarding previous land usage. This exercise demonstrated that \nboth calabrese and wheat had been grown in the fields, prior to the potato crop, so the same \n 15\ngeographical areas would have been included in the sampling exercise, had one of the other \ncommodities been chosen for the Between-Farm study.  \n \nTotal soil-Se concentrations in the dataset as a whole ranged from 0.115 to 0.877 mg kg-1 \n(Table 4). These values were within a similar range to those reported previously for Scottish \nsoils (Ure et al., 1979; MacLeod et al., 1996; Shand and Hillier, 2009). However, the results \nwere narrower in range, and lower in average concentration, than those reported by Fordyce \net al. (2010) for rural soils on the periphery of Glasgow (Figure 1). This was expected given \nthe influence of urban contamination on the rural environment around Glasgow, as well as \nthe presence of coals and peaty soils in the Glasgow area. Average Se concentrations from \nthe present study (0.444 mg kg-1) were comparable to world soil averages (0.400 mg kg-1, \nFordyce, 2005) and to an extensive area of Eastern England (Humber-Trent; East Midlands \nand East Anglia) surveyed by the BGS (0.400 mg Se kg-1 in 19,500 soil samples; BGS, \n2009). Although the present project aimed to target low and high-Se environments in \nScotland; the range in total Se concentrations was very narrow. Indeed, the majority of soil \ntotal-Se values were below the suggested deficiency threshold in soils for the rearing of \nanimals (0.6 mg kg-1, Fordyce, 2005). These low values were to be expected as rock types \nthat would give rise to high-Se soils (such as black shales) are rare and limited in their spatial \nextent in Scotland. Water-soluble soil-Se concentrations ranged from 6.69 to 26.78 \u00b5g kg-1 \n(Table 4). These concentrations were much higher than those reported from Se-deficient \nareas of China (0.03-5 \u00b5g kg-1; Fordyce, 2005) but markedly lower than values in Se-rich \nareas of England and Ireland (50-430 \u00b5g kg-1; Nye and Peterson, 1975). Water-soluble soil-\nSe accounted for 1-3% of the soil total-Se concentration in most cases, which is comparable \nto ranges reported previously for UK soils (1-2% Williams and Thornton, 1973; Nye and \nPeterson, 1975) but much lower than the 50% water-soluble soil-Se reported from \nseleniferous areas of the USA (Nye and Peterson, 1975). Soil pH values ranged from 4.11 to \n6.59, and were fairly typical of the acid and acid-neutral soils present over much of Scotland \n(Table 4). Selenium is more bioavailable in alkaline than acid conditions; therefore the acid-\n 16\nneutral nature of soils in the present study may inhibit the uptake of the element into plants \nand animals. Indeed the results for soil pH and the proportion of water-soluble soil-Se \nhighlight the contrast in bioavailable-Se between the arid alkaline Se-rich environments of \nthe Mid-West USA and the temperate acid-neutral Se-poor environments of much of the UK. \nSoil loss-on-ignition was measured as an indicator of organic matter content, and values \nranged from 1.71 to 14.30%. These values are indicative of moderate to high organic matter \ncontents, typical of Scottish soils (SEERAD, 2006).  \n \n4.2.2 Food and grass \nThe total Se concentrations in the food products and grass samples collected for the present \nstudy are outlined in Table 5 for information only since - with the exception of potatoes - the \ncommodity samples were collected from pairs of farms only. Therefore, the results are not \nindicative of Se concentrations in these foodstuffs in Scotland. However, it should be noted \nthat the Se concentrations in grass were below recommended levels for forage intake of 40 \n\u00b5g kg-1 (Levander, 1986) and, with the exception of milk, concentrations in food were \ncomparable to or lower than those reported in the same foodstuffs as part of the UK TDS and \nin studies from the USA and elsewhere (Table 5) (Fordyce et al., 2009). \n \n4.3 Can geology be used to predict the concentration of Se in the overlying soil? \nExamination (two-sided t-test) of the combined Between-Farm dataset of 44 soils, showed \nthat the total soil-Se concentrations from the predicted high-Se areas were significantly \nhigher (p<0.05) than those in the predicted low-Se areas as expected. However, the Se \nconcentration range between the two was narrow, with much overlap between the two \ndatasets (Figure 4a). Indeed, only 12.6% of the variance between the datasets was \naccounted for by the predicted Se area. Plotting the locations of these results confirmed the \nlack of a marked spatial association between the predicted high-Se areas and demonstrably \nhigher total soil-Se concentrations than in the predicted low-Se areas (Figure 3). Indeed, the \n 17\naverage total soil-Se concentration in predicted high-Se areas (0.484 mg kg-1) was only 1.3 \ntimes greater than that in predicted low-Se areas (0.372 mg kg-1).  \n \nFurther interrogation (two-sided t-test) of the Main Study soil-Se dataset, on commodity-by-\ncommodity basis, showed that the total soil-Se concentrations were significantly higher in the \npredicted high-Se potato and wheat farms than the predicted low-Se areas as expected \n(p<0.01 and p<0.001 respectively). Although total soil-Se concentrations from the predicted \nlow-Se milk farm were generally lower than from the predicted high-Se milk farm; for milk and \nbeef farm soils, there was no statistically significant difference in Se concentration (p=0.18 \nand p=0.21 respectively) between the two areas. This was despite the fact that Se-containing \nNPK fertiliser had been applied within the last four months to the field sampled at the \npredicted high-Se beef farm (2.82 g ha-1 sodium selenate; three times per year).  \n \nOn the two farms from which the calabrese samples were collected, the total soil-Se \nconcentration was significantly higher in the predicted low-Se area, than in the predicted \nhigh-Se area (p<0.001). An explanation for this disparity is the highly variable nature of the \nCarboniferous rock types in Fife where the predicted high-Se calabrese soils were collected \n(Figure 3). Carboniferous rock types underlie much of the Central Belt of Scotland from \nAyrshire to Fife. These largely comprise cyclical sequences of narrow coals, shales, \nmudstones and siltstones (all likely to be higher in Se; Fordyce, 2005) interbedded with \nsandstones and limestones (likely to be lower in Se Fordyce, 2005). This made the \ncategorisation of these rocks into potential low and high-Se areas difficult. Evidence from the \nG-BASE Glasgow soils dataset (Figure 1) was that soils developed over these Carboniferous \ncyclical sequences were likely to be higher in Se than some other rocks. Therefore, these \nrock types were classed as high-Se soil parent materials for the present study (Fordyce et \nal., 2008). Examination of the soil from the predicted high-Se calabrese farm showed that it \nwas sandy in texture and contained the lowest organic matter content (mean 3.66%) \nreported on any of the farms surveyed in this study. This suggested that these soils were \n 18\ncollected on a sandstone-dominated part of the geological sequence, with the sandy nature \nof the soils and low organic matter content probably accounting for the lower-than-expected \nSe concentration in this sample. Therefore, using the additional information gained regarding \nthe relationship between soil-Se and soil texture\/organic matter, during the present study it \nshould be possible to further refine the definitions of high and low-Se areas within the \nCarboniferous sequences, thereby improving the accuracy of the overall prediction strategy \nin the future. \n \nThese results highlighted the difficulties in trying to estimate soil-Se concentrations at any \ngiven location but none-the-less demonstrated that the selection of high and low-Se areas, \non the basis of geological parent materials alone could, to a certain degree, be used to \npredict the total Se concentration of the soil. However, no striking contrast in total soil-Se \nconcentration was observed between the two areas. Furthermore, even in the predicted high-\nSe area, the majority of soils could be classed as being Se-deficient, as they were below the \n0.6 mg kg-1 recommended threshold for grazing livestock (Fordyce, 2005). \n \nMany factors, not just the total soil-Se concentration control the amount of water-soluble Se \npresent in soil. Therefore, it was not anticipated that the geology-based classification of high \nand low-Se areas would apply to the water-soluble soil-Se concentration. However, the \nsuccess or otherwise of the high and low-Se area classification, in relation to water-soluble \nsoil-Se concentration, was assessed (two-sided t-test). The results from the combined \nBetween-Farm dataset of 44 soils showed that although water-soluble soil-Se concentrations \nwere marginally higher in the predicted low-Se areas (Figure 4b); there was no statistically \nsignificant difference between the two Se areas (p=0.71).  \n \nOne interesting observation from the Main Study dataset was that the water-soluble soil-Se \nconcentrations from the predicted high and low-Se milk farms were notably higher (mean \nconcentrations = 22.51 and 18.17 \u00b5g kg-1, respectively) than reported for any of the other \n 19\nfarms (mean concentrations 7.68 \u2013 12.97 \u00b5g kg-1). The reasons for this are uncertain and \nrequire further investigation.  \n \nTherefore, as expected, the water-soluble soil-Se concentrations showed no clear \nrelationship with predicted high and low-Se areas and it was not possible to predict water-\nsoluble soil-Se concentration on the basis of geological parent materials alone. Similarly, soil \npH and LOI showed no statistically significant difference in concentration between predicted \nhigh and low-Se areas (p=0.60 for pH and p=0.17 for LOI; two-sided t-test) (Figures 4c and \n4d respectively).   \n  \nThe relationships between the four soil parameters in the combined dataset of 44 soils were \nevaluated, identifying significant correlations (Pearson correlation) between LOI and both \ntotal and water-soluble soil-Se (p<0.001; Table 6). These findings indicated that the soil \norganic matter content had a significant control over soil-Se concentrations as expected. \nIndeed, from adjusted R2, 56.1% of the total Se and 48.0% of the water-soluble soil-Se \nvariance in concentration was accounted for by the soil organic matter content. This also \nhelped explain the apparent significant correlation between total soil-Se and water-soluble \nsoil-Se concentrations (p=<0.01) evident in the dataset (Table 6). The results demonstrated \nthat soil organic matter content had a greater control than geologically predicted high or low-\nSe parent material on the Se concentration of the soil. These results concur with those of \nShand and Hillier (2009) who also found that soil organic matter content exerted a greater \ncontrol on soil-Se concentrations than parent material type in Scottish agricultural soils.  \n \nNo significant correlations were observed between pH and the other soil parameters, which \nmay have been due to the very narrow range of pH values observed (Table 6). \n \nThese results suggest that inclusion of information on organic-rich superficial deposit soil \nparent materials such as peat or of soil organic matter content, for which there is a low \n 20\nresolution (5 km) national database for Scotland (MI, 2009), would improve the prediction of \nlow and high-Se areas for future investigations. They also suggest that organic-rich soils \ntypical of the upland areas of Scotland (SEERAD, 2006) are likely to contain more Se than \nsoils in the main agricultural growing areas. Whether the Se in these soils would be readily \navailable for plant\/animal uptake is open to debate. Early work in Ireland showed some \nevidence that Se was more bioavailable to plants in seleniferous poorly drained peats than \nother soil types (Williams and Thornton, 1973). However, other studies have demonstrated \nthat Se in organic-rich soils may be held in the soil and not readily phyto-bioavailable \n(Johnson et al., 2000).  Further investigations would be required to establish the Se content \nof upland organic-rich Scottish soils and their relationship with the Se-status of foodstuffs \nproduced from them such as lamb. \n \n4.4 Grass and foodstuff relationships with predicted high and low-Se areas \nThe second aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of using geological soil parent \nmaterial information to predict the likely Se concentrations in agricultural commodities grown \nin predicted low and high-Se areas.  \n \nIn the Main Study dataset, the majority of food commodities demonstrated a significant \ndifference (two-sided t-test) in relative total Se concentrations between the two predicted Se \nareas. Namely, beef (p<0.001); wheat (p<0.001); calabrese (p<0.01) and beef-farm grass \n(p<0.05). Indeed, 71.5%, 69.6% and 50.8% of the variance in Se concentration in the beef, \nwheat and calabrese samples, respectively, was explained by the predicted Se area. No \nstatistically significant difference in Se concentration was observed in the potatoes (p=0.36), \nmilk (p=0.08) and milk-farm grass (p=0.18).  \n \nThese results presented some argument for pursuing the use of existing \ngeological\/geochemical information to predict the likely concentrations of Se in certain food \ncommodities, and emphasised that refinement of the soil parent material classification \n 21\nsystem and examination of the importance of crop types\/varieties, were areas worthy of \nfurther effort. \n \n4.5 Relationships between foodstuff-Se and grass-Se, and soil-Se concentrations \nAnother aim of this project was to assess whether differences in soil-Se concentrations were \nreflected in the foodstuffs produced on them. Although the food commodity and grass-Se \nconcentrations generally reflected the predicted high and low-Se areas, the relationships with \nthe measured soil-Se concentrations were more complex. Analysis of the direct relationships \nbetween the soil parameters and commodity Se concentrations was only truly possible for \ncalabrese, potato, wheat and grass samples. For the milk and beef samples, the animals \nwere in contact with relatively large areas of soil and grass, and were open to additional \ninputs, other than the grass on which they were feeding, e.g., mineral supplements, \nantibiotics, etc, making discussion of the relationships more tenuous.  \n \nTable 7 highlights those parameters where a significant correlation (ANOVA) was observed \nbetween a commodity and total soil-Se concentration. The table also presents the other soil \nparameters that exhibited a significant correlation with the Se concentration in a foodstuff.   \n \nIn the Between-Farm dataset, potato Se concentrations showed a high correlation with total \nsoil-Se (p<0.001). Similarly, in the Main Study dataset, wheat Se correlated significantly with \ntotal soil-Se (p<0.001). Indeed, 72.8% (R2) of the variance in wheat concentration was \naccounted for by the total soil-Se concentration. In contrast, the calabrese and beef farm \ngrass-Se results showed negative correlations with total soil-Se and water-soluble soil-Se, \nrespectively. The reasons for these disparities are unclear but may relate either to marginally \ndifferent ages in the grass\/calabrese at the two sets of farms at the times of sampling (even \nthough in the case of calabrese, sampling was carried out within a week of predicted harvest \ndate), or differences in trace element fertiliser application noted in the questionnaires from \nthe two sets of farms (the predicted low-Se calabrese farm soils received Cu and Mo \n 22\nfertilisers and the predicted high-Se beef farm soils received Se fertilisers). It is also possible \nthat the lower organic matter content of the predicted high-Se calabrese farm soil facilitated \nuptake of Se into the calabrese, despite lower soil-Se concentrations.  \n \nNo significant correlations were observed between any of the parameters measured in the \nsoil and the Se concentration in the milk-farm grass or Main Study potato samples. This may \nreflect the limited variation in soil-Se concentrations observed between the predicted high \nand low-Se areas in this dataset.  \n \nThese results highlight the complexity of soil-to-plant element uptake, which is controlled by \nmany environmental and physiological processes. Therefore, care must be taken if \nattempting to estimate how a particular plant may respond in a predicted high or low-Se \nlocation. For the animal-based samples, similar comments apply, but there are an even \ngreater range of factors influencing the geology-soil-food relationship. Further investigations \nwould be required to establish the mechanisms controlling Se uptake into plants and animals \nin Scotland, as the results from the present study are based on two farms only for each \ncommodity. \n \nNone-the-less, the results of this study have demonstrated that soils in the main agricultural \ngrowing areas of Scotland and the foodstuffs produced from them are likely to be low in Se \nconcentration. Therefore, further examinations to determine the Se-status of Scottish \nproduce and the Scottish diet may be justified. Should these demonstrate an insufficiency of \nSe; methods to raise the Se content of foodstuffs by the application of Se-fertiliser to \nagricultural soils and crops may be worthy of consideration. These methods are currently \nunder trial in the UK as part of the Biofortification through Agronomy and Genotypes to \nElevate Levels of Selenium (BAGELS) project (Broadley et al, 2010; Stroud et al., 2010a; \nStroud et al., 2010b) and have been used successfully in other Se-deficient countries such \nFinland (Eurola et al., 2003) and New Zealand (Oldfield, 1999) to raise Se dietary intake. \n 23\nHowever, any attempts to increase the Se-status of Scottish foodstuffs should be mindful that \nthere is emerging evidence - from trials into the potential benefits of Se in prostate cancer in \nthe United States - of a possible link between moderately high (200 \u00b5g day-1) intakes of Se \nand increased risk of Type 2 diabetes (Stranges et al., 2007; Lippman et al., 2009; Vinceti et \nal., 2009). \n \n \n5. Conclusions \nThis study has demonstrated that, in the absence of national soil-Se geochemical maps for \nScotland, geological soil parent material information alone can, in part, be used to predict \ndifferences in the Se concentration of Scottish soils, and for three of the five staple food \ncommodities chosen (wheat, beef and calabrese). However, the difference in total soil-Se \nconcentration between predicted high and low-Se areas was marginal. From this, it is not \nunreasonable to consider the further development of the predictive strategy, to incorporate a \nmore detailed approach to defining likely high and low-Se areas on the basis of existing \ngeological\/geochemical information, including soil organic matter content. Similarly, there are \naspects of the foodstuff selection that would benefit from further investigation, e.g., food type, \nvariety, age, etc.  \n \nThe study also highlighted the fact that trends in soil-Se concentration will not always be \nreflected in the foodstuffs produced from them (only wheat and potato Se concentrations \ncorrelated significantly with soil-Se), suggesting that parameters, other than soil parent \nmaterial and soil-Se, need to be considered in any future studies into the relationships \nbetween soil and foodstuffs in Scotland. \n \nThis study also confirmed previous investigations, indicating that the Se concentrations of \nScottish soils are generally low i.e., below the 0.6 mg kg-1 recommended threshold for \ngrazing livestock. Hence; even if the prediction of likely high and low-Se areas is refined in \n 24\nthe future; high-Se soils are unlikely to be common in the main agricultural growing areas of \nScotland. Furthermore, the Se concentrations in grass from this study were below the 40 \u00b5g \nkg-1 recommended deficiency threshold for grazing livestock. Given the relatively low \nconcentrations of Se also reported in the food commodities sampled, further investigations \nmay be warranted in order to fully characterise the Se concentration of Scottish produce and, \nhence, in the Scottish diet. An outcome of this may be consideration of a national soil-Se \nsupplementation strategy, via fertiliser applications, as has been performed in some other \ncountries.  \n \n \n6.
