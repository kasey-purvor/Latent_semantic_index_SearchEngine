Dielectrophoresis3 \u0001DEP\u0002, the\nmovement of particles in nonuniform electric fields, has been\nused to separate mixtures of semiconducting and metallic\nSWNTs.4\u20136 Measurement of the frequency-dependent collec-\ntion of DEP has thus far been based on Raman spectroscopy,\nwhich requires some complex interpretation of results.7\u20139 In\nthis letter, we report the application of combined dielectro-\nphoresis and impedance measurements to provide real time\nrapid, accurate measurement of dielectrophoretic collection\nof SWNTs, and hence their dielectric properties and chiral\nproportions.\nSWNTs were made by laser ablation and suspended in a\nTriton X-100 solution. Measurements were performed on\nneedle-shaped electrodes with a 10 \u0001m gap, energized with a\nsinusoidal 10 Vpk-pk, at five or more frequencies per decade\nbetween 10 kHz and 20 MHz. A resistance was connected in\nseries, and the voltage measured across the resistor and\nresistor\/electrode combination using a digital oscilloscope.\nThe oscilloscope output to a computer, which calculated the\nresistance of the interelectrode gap at 1 s intervals. The re-\ncording process began prior to the SWNTs suspension being\nplaced on the electrodes, and continued for typically 5 min.\nThe time constant of the change of resistance as a function of\ntime was then obtained.\nFigure 1\u0001a\u0002 shows a representative selection of imped-\nance versus time data which has been normalized to the elec-\ntrode impedance. The solution conductivity was measured at\n1.3 mS m\u22121, causing a 30% decrease in resistance after ap-\nplication. Two types of behavior were observed in nanotube\nsolutions. At high frequencies, an initial resistance drop at\nthe application of the sample was followed by an exponential\na\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\nm.hughes@surrey.ac.uk\n0003-6951\/2006\/88\u000324\u0001\/243109\/3\/$23.00 88, 24310\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject todecrease to a stable value at approximately 200 s. The de-\ncrease in resistance \u0001final with respect to initial values\u0002 was\n53% for 1 MHz, 39% for 2 MHz, and 48% for 5 MHz. At\nlower frequencies, the reduction was more significant, e.g.,\n88% for 20 kHz, 79% for 50 kHz, and 67% for 100 kHz. At\n20 MHz, the response indicated that the impedance change\nwas due to the medium alone, that is, the result was identical\nto the control measurement and no collection occurred.\nIf we hypothesize that the time taken for the impedance\nto change due to the collection of nanotubes is inversely\nproportional to the force acting on those tubes, then the re-\nciprocal of the time constant should indicate the magnitude\nof the force. A similar approach has been taken using fluo-\nrescence measurements of latex beads to determine their di-\nelectric properties.10 Across a population of particles, this\nreciprocal also indicates the relative population of subpopu-\nlations of particles. By modeling the population using known\nmodels of dielectrophoretic behavior, we determined the di-\nelectric properties of each population and their relative\nnumber.11\nA plot of the reciprocal collection time constant is shown\nin Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002. Two dielectric dispersions are evident, centered\napproximately at 250 kHz and 13 MHz. This is consistent\nwith behavior we would expect for a heterogeneous mix of\nmetallic and semiconducting SWNTs.11 For a spherical par-\nticle of radius r the DEP force is given by\nFsphere = 2\u0002r3\u0003m Re\u0005 \u0003p* \u2212 \u0003m*\n\u0003p\n* + 2\u0003m\n* \u0006 \u0002 E2, \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0003m is the permittivity of the suspending medium, E is\nthe local \u0001rms\u0002 electric field, \u0001 is the differential vector op-\nerator, \u0003p\n* and \u0003m\n* are the complex permittivities of the par-\nticle and medium, respectively, \u0003*=\u0003\u2212 j\u0001\u0004 \/\u0005\u0002, where \u0003 is\nthe permittivity, \u0004 is the conductivity, \u0005 is the angular fre-\nquency of the applied field, j=\u0007\u22121, and Re denotes the real\npart.

These two effects are termed posi-\ntive and negative DEP, respectively.\nThe solid line on Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002 represents the best fit for two\npopulations of nanotubes, superimposed to determine the net\nfrequency-dependent SWNTs collection. A spherical model,\npostulated by Krupke et al.4 to account for ballistic ion trans-\nport, was found to provide a good fit for the conducting\nnanotubes, when the nanotubes were assigned a conductivity\nof 130 mS m\u22121 and a relative permittivity of less than 40\u00030.\nWe were able to obtain a unique set of parameters that en-\nabled us to model semiconducting nanotubes either as\nspheres or as long, thin ellipsoids\u2014an approach that has\nbeen used for dielectrophoretic modeling of rod-shaped\nnanoparticles in the past.12 Both models have been proposed\nfor the description of the DEP behavior of SWNTs by\nKrupke et al.4,6\nIn the case of a spherical model, the semiconducting\nnanotubes had a conductivity of 2.2 mS m\u22121, and for the pro-\nlate ellipsoid model, 2.5 mS m\u22121. As with the conducting\nnanotubes, the model indicates a permittivity of less than\nFIG. 1.

The presence of Triton on the SWNTs may also affect\nthis value. Since the nanotubes vary only in chirality, we\nwould expect both metallic and semiconducting SWNTs to\nhave identical electrical Debye layer properties.\nWe can further determine the relative populations of the\nparticles by determining the relative multiples of each re-\nquired to match the spectra in Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002. Our calculations\nindicate that where the semiconducting nanotubes are mod-\neled as prolate ellipsoids, the proportions of the two polariz-\nability plots in Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002 indicate that the population contains\n78.5 \u0001\u00b11% \u0002 semiconducting SWNTs, with the remainder be-\ning metallic. This proportion appears high at first, but is com-\nmensurate with the findings of Samsonidze et al.15 who\nshowed that semiconducting nanotubes dissolved preferen-\ntially in Octadecylamine \u0001ODA\u0002; if similar effects are present\nin Triton-dissolved nanotubes, we would anticipate the result\ndescribed here. If the spherical model is used, the proportion\nof semiconducting nanotubes is much higher \u000195\u00b10.5% \u0002.\nIn order to validate these results, we used optical absorp-\ntion, a theoretically valid technique for the determination of\nthe ratio metallic:semiconducting SWNTs \u0001Ref. 8\u0002 which\nhas widely been employed for carbon nanotube\ncharacterization.16\u201319 UV\/Vis\/NIR spectroscopy was per-\nformed after drop casting the solution on a glass slide and\nheating to 200 \u00b0C for 1 h.

Appl. Phys. Lett. 88, 243109 \u00032006\u0001as spheres only hold for ballistic transport, which does not\ntake place in semiconducting SWNTs. This result also sug-\ngests that it is possible to determine the proportion of metal-\nlic and semiconducting SWNTs in a suspension using only\ntwo impedance measurements, at frequencies chosen so as to\ncollect both types at low frequency, and only metallic nano-\ntubes at high frequency. Such a method has significant po-\ntential to greatly simplify the methods available today for the\nanalysis of SWNTs pre- and post-separation.\nRaman spectroscopy was also used to characterize our\nsamples and to calculate the ratio metallic:semiconducting\nSWNTs. We used a confocal Raman microscope with two\nlasers operating at 728 and 514 nm. Krupke et al.4 previ-\nously concluded that, with a 514 nm laser and a wide nano-\ntubes diameters distribution centred at 1.1 nm, all metallic\nSWNTs have radial breathing mode \u0001RBM\u0002 frequencies in\nthe range of 218\u2013280 cm\u22121 and all semiconducting SWNTs\nhave RBM frequencies ranging between 175 and 213 cm\u22121.\nThen they applied a formula involving the ratio of the inte-\ngrated peaks of metallic and semiconducting SWNTs to cal-\nculate their relative proportions. On the other hand, Kataura\net al.8 predicted without ambiguity which types of SWNTs\nwill be resonant with a specific laser excitation, depending\non diameters and chirality. Based on the plots of Kataura et\nal., we conclude that in order to get a quantitative measure-\nment, Raman spectroscopy is useful only when the tubes\nhave a broad diameter distribution centered at 1.1 nm. How-\never, where the diameter distribution is narrower and cen-\ntered at higher value, it is not possible to excite both metallic\nand semiconducting tubes with the same laser energy; that is\nto say, the 514 nm laser will excite semiconducting tubes and\nconversely, the 782 nm laser will excite the metallic tubes.\nWe confirmed this using measurements which are consistent\nwith this theoretical prediction. With the 514 nm laser, we\nobserve a peak in the RBM region below 200 cm\u22121 corre-\nsponding to semiconducting nanotubes \u0001cf. Fig. 3, curve a\u0002.\nWith the 782 nm laser, the spectrum shows a RBM band\nabove 200 cm\u22121 attributed to metallic nanotubes \u0001cf. Fig. 3,\nFIG. 3.

Redistribution subject tocurve b\u0002. Therefore, with our distribution of diameters, nei-\nther of these two lasers will enable us to excite simulta-\nneously the two types of SWNTs and thus to calculate their\nrespective proportions. We suggest that under our experi-\nmental conditions, optical absorption is the only method that\ncan be used to accurately validate our dielectrophoretic mea-\nsurements. We believe this letter will highlight to the com-\nmunity the importance of understanding the methodology\nand limitations of each experimental technique used for the\ncharacterisation of SWNTs.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated a rapid, precise,\nand low-cost method for performing dielectric spectroscopy\non SWNTs suspensions, allowing rapid, accurate determina-\ntion of both the dielectric properties of the SWNTs and the\nproportions of metallic and semiconducting SWNTs. The\nprecision afforded by the system has potential for providing\nmore accurate control over defining the optimal conditions\nfor the large-scale separation of SWNTs required for the\nadoption of nanotubes as a material of choice in the semi-\nconductor industry.\nThis work was supported by EPSRC Grant No. GR\/\nS44594.
