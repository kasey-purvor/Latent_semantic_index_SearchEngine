We show that its pocket C domain is both necessary and sufficient for nuclear\nanchorage by transiently expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras of Rb fragments in\ntissue culture cells and by extracting the cells with hypotonic solutions.

On redistribution of endogenous lamin A\/C and LAP2\u0001 into nuclear aggregates by\noverexpressing dominant negative lamin mutants in tissue culture cells, Rb was also sequestered\ninto these aggregates. In primary skin fibroblasts, LAP2\u0001 is expressed in a growth-dependent\nmanner. Anchorage of hypophosphorylated Rb in the nucleus was weakened significantly in the\nabsence of LAP2\u0001.

This level of organization implies\nthat architectural proteins link chromatin to the nuclear\nenvelope (NE) or to a nucleoskeleton, and similar proteins\nalso anchor regulators of transcription and DNA replication\nto nuclear bodies. The recent description of human genetic\ndiseases that arise as a result of mutations in nuclear archi-\ntectural proteins (Hutchison et al., 2001; Wilson, 2000) high-\nlights the importance of the structure of the nucleus in\nrelation to its function.\nThe major structural framework in the nucleus is the\nnuclear lamina, which determines both the size and shape of\nthe nucleus and its mechanical stability (reviewed by Moir\nand Goldman, 1995; Vaughan et al., 2000). The major com-\nponents of the lamina are the nuclear lamins, which are\nmembers of the intermediate filament family, and lamina-\nassociated polypeptides (LAPs). Lamins have reported func-\ntions in DNA replication (Meier et al., 1991; Jenkins et al.,\n1993; Ellis et al., 1997; Spann et al., 1997; Moir et al., 2000) and\nnuclear pore organization (Lenz-Bohme et al., 1997; Liu et al.,\n2000; Smythe et al., 2000). In addition, one member of the\nLAP family, LAP2\u0002, has also been reported to influence NE\ngrowth (Yang et al., 1997) and DNA replication (Gant et al.,\n1999). A second member of the LAP family, emerin, when\nmutated gives rise to Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy,\nimplying that it also has important functions, possibly in\ntissue-specific transcription regulation (reviewed by Morris\nand Manilal, 1999; Cohen et al., 2001).\nA recently described member of the LAP family is LAP2\u0001.\nThe LAP2 protein originally described in rat nuclear enve-\nlopes (Foisner and Gerace, 1993) has now been shown to be\none member of a family of nuclear proteins derived from a\nsingle gene by alternative splicing (Harris et al., 1994; Berger\net al., 1996). Three abundant proteins are expressed from the\nhuman LAP2 gene, namely, LAP2\u0001 (75 kDa), LAP2\u0002 (51\nkDa), and LAP2\u0003 (39 kDa) (Harris et al., 1995).

In contrast, LAP2\u0001\nshares a 187-amino acid N-terminal domain with LAP2\u0002\nand \u0003, but this is followed by a 506-amino acid \u0001-specific\ndomain lacking transmembrane regions. LAP2\u0001 has been\nshown to be distributed throughout the nucleus, rather than\nat the NE (Dechat et al., 1998). Complexes of LAP2\u0001 and\nA-type lamins form architectural, interchromosomal struc-\ntures (Dechat et al., 1998, 2000). The interaction of LAP2\u0001\nwith chromatin seems to require the \u0001-specific domain (Vl-\ncek et al., 1999) and is likely regulated by cell cycle-depen-\ndent phosphorylation (Dechat et al., 1998). These important\nfindings imply that LAP2\u0001 may have a number of functions\nin higher order chromatin interactions. This includes func-\ntions in the mitotic assembly\/disassembly of the nucleus\nand\/or as an anchorage protein for transcription regulators.\nThe retinoblastoma protein p110Rb (Rb) controls progres-\nsion through the cell cycle by negatively regulating the E2F\ntranscription factor in a phosphorylation-dependent manner\n(Chellappan et al., 1991). Rb has a well-characterized domain\nstructure consisting of an N-terminal domain followed by\nthree C-terminal pocket domains termed A, B, and C (Figure\n1). The N-terminal domain is capable of oligomerization\n(Hensey et al., 1994) and binds to an 84-kDa protein that\ncolocalizes with centers of RNA processing (Durfee et al.,\n1994). The large A\/B pocket binds to the E2F transcription\nfactor (Cao et al., 1992; Lees et al., 1993) and D-type cyclins\n(Dowdy et al., 1993; Ewen et al., 1993). It also forms a com-\nplex with histone deacetylase (Brehm et al., 1998; Luo et al.,\n1998; Magnaghi-Jaulin et al., 1998), presumably leading to\nlong-range silencing of genes required for cell division\n(Zhang et al., 2000). Pocket C has been shown to contain a\nnuclear localization signal sequence (NLS; Zacksenhaus et\nal., 1993) and binds both the c-Abl tyrosine kinase (Welch\nand Wang, 1993, 1995) and MDM2 (Xiao et al., 1995).\nBinding of Rb to its targets is regulated by phosphoryla-\ntion in a cell cycle-dependent manner (Lees et al., 1991;\nreviewed by Wang et al., 1994). Anchorage of Rb in the\nnucleus is also regulated by phosphorylation in that hypo-\nphosphorylated Rb, capable of binding E2F, is anchored in\nthe nucleus during G1 phase of the cell cycle (Mittnacht and\nWeinberg, 1991; Mancini et al., 1994). Internal deletions or\nmutations of Rb within a region spanning pockets B and C\npromote tumorigenesis and prevent nuclear anchorage of\nthe protein (Mittnacht and Weinberg, 1991), giving rise to\nthe hypothesis that nuclear anchorage of Rb as well as\nbinding to E2F are both essential for its function. Clearly, if\nthe identity of the protein (or proteins) that anchor Rb to the\nnucleoskeleton were known, a test of this hypothesis would\nbe possible. Previous reports have revealed that Rb binds to\nA-type lamins in blot overlay assays through its large pocket\ndomain (Ozaki et al., 1994), suggesting that lamin A might\nanchor Rb within the nucleus. Herein, we report that LAP2\u0001,\nwhich we have previously identified as an interaction part-\nner for nucleoskeletal lamin A\/C, binds to Rb within a\nregion spanning pockets B and C. Disruption of the normal\ndistribution of lamins A\/C and LAP2\u0001 leads to a similar\ndisruption of Rb distribution, and hypophosphorylated Rb\nis not retained in the nucleus of cells expressing low levels of\nLAP2\u0001. Taken together, these data suggest that LAP2\u0001\u2013\nlamin A\/C complexes have an important role in the nuclear\nanchorage of Rb.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell Cultures\nCells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, Paisley, United King-\ndom). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were supple-\nmented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Human dermal fibroblasts\n(HDF) were supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (NCS) as\nrecommended. The osteosarcoma cell line SA0S-2 was supple-\nmented with 10% FCS. Cultures were maintained at 60\u201370% con-\nfluence. To induce quiescence in HDF, cultures were transferred to\nmedium containing 0.5% NCS for 5 d. To stimulate HDF to reenter\nthe cell cycle, quiescent cultures were transferred to medium con-\ntaining 10% NCS.\nTransient Expression of Fusion Constructs in Cells\nHEK293 cells were grown on DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal\ncalf serum (FCS). Cell cultures were maintained in an incubator\nwith 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. For transfections, cells were grown to 25\u201330%\nconfluence in 45-mm dishes. A mixture of 5 \u0004g of plasmid DNA,\n0.12 M CaCl2, and HBS (70 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Na2HPO4, HEPES,\npH 7.0) was added to 2 ml of culture medium. The medium was\nreplaced after 24 h, and fusion proteins were transiently expressed\nin cells for an additional 24 h.\nImmunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy\nCells grown on glass coverslips were either fixed with 4% formal-\ndehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at room\ntemperature and permeabilized in PBS\/0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min\nor extracted with hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10\nmM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol\n[DTT]) followed by fixation. Primary and secondary antibodies\nwere applied in PBS\/1% NCS (PBS\/NCS) for 1 h at room temper-\nature. Primary antibodies used were as described in Table 1 and\ndiluted in PBS\/NCS. Secondary antibodies were donkey anti-\nmouse, goat, or rabbit IgG conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine B\nisothiocyanate (TRITC) or Cy5 (Jackson Immunoresearch, West\nGrove, PA) and diluted 1:100 in PBS\/NCS. After several washes in\nPBS, samples were mounted in Mowiol\/4,6-diamidino-2-phenylin-\ndole (DAPI)\/DABCO and viewed with an inverted fluorescent mi-\ncroscope Axiovert 10 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), fitted with a\n12-bit charge-couple device camera controlled with IPLab software\nor with a Radiance 2000 confocal microscope imaging system with\nLaserSharp software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).\nSolid Phase Overlay Assay\nLamin C cDNA in pBlueScript KS\u0001 (a gift from G. Krohne, Univer-\nsity of Wu\u00a8rzburg, Wu\u00a8rzburg, Germany) and LAP2\u0001 cDNA in\npET23a plasmid (Dechat et al., 1998) were transcribed in vitro by\nusing T7 polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), and RNAs were\ntranslated in vitro by using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and\n[35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA), according\nto the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-\nfusion constructs of Rb corresponding to pocket A (aa 379\u2013612),\npocket B (aa 612\u2013792), and pocket C (aa 792\u2013928), and GST fusion of\nlamin C covering its C-terminal domain (aa 319\u2013572) were sepa-\nrated by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970). Gels were stained with Coo-\nmassie or transblotted onto nitrocellulose (0.2 \u0004m; Schleicher &\nSchuell, Dassel, Germany) in 48 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, 39 mM\nglycine by using the Mini Transblot system (Bio-Rad). Nitrocellu-\nlose membranes were incubated in overlay buffer (10 mM HEPES,\npH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 0.1% Triton\nX-100, 1 mM DTT) for 1 h. Filters were then blocked with 2% bovine\nE.

After extensive washing in overlay buffer, nitrocellu-\nlose was air dried, and bound proteins were detected by autora-\ndiography.\nPreparation of Cell Extracts\nCells were grown in 90-mm petri dishes. Medium was aspirated\nfrom the petri dishes and the cultures were washed twice with PBS.\nCultures were extracted by incubation with hypotonic buffer (10\nmM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton\nX-100, 0.5 mM DTT) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The buffer was removed and\nthe cells were washed twice with fresh hypotonic buffer and then\nscraped directly into radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer for\nSDS-PAGE.\nImmunoprecipitation\nMouse IgG Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway) were coupled\nto lamin A\/C or LAP2\u0001-specific antibody by incubation for 12 h at\n4\u00b0C in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin. Asynchronously\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of GFP-Rb fusion constructs (a). Transient expression of GFP-Rb fusion constructs in HEK293 cells.\nGFP-Rb fusion proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells for 72 h. Cells were solublized in sample buffer and proteins analyzed\nby SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting by using monoclonal antibodies to GFP (b).\nLAP2\u0001 Is Required for Anchorage of Rb\nVol. 13, December 2002 4403\ngrowing cells were extracted with hypotonic solution containing 10\nmM KCl, 10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton\nX-100, 0.5 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors. After a 10-min incu-\nbation at 4\u00b0C, nuclei were isolated with homogenization and sam-\nples were centrifuged for 5 min in Eppendorf microcentrifuge.\nNuclei were extracted with buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and sam-\nples were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. Soluble fractions after\ndialysis to PBS\/0.1% Triton X-100 were processed for immunopre-\ncipitation by using LAP2\u0001 and lamin A\/C-specific antibody cou-\npled to 100 \u0004l of mouse IgG Dynabeads. After 2-h incubation at 4\u00b0C,\nbeads were washed with PBS\/0.1%Triton X-100 (3 \u0002 5 volumes)\nand prepared for gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting.\nGel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting\nOne-dimensional SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli\n(1970). For immunoblotting, proteins separated on gels were elec-\ntrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose (0.2 mm; Schleicher &\nSchuell) in 48 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, 39 mM glycine by using the\nMini Transblot system (Bio-Rad). For the immunological detection\nof proteins the enhanced chemiluminescence system was used. Pri-\nmary antibodies were as described in Table 1. Secondary antibodies\nwere goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase\n(Jackson Immunoresearch).\nCloning of GFP-Rb Fusion Constructs\nA series of N- and C-terminal deletion constructs of Rb were created\nby restriction digestion of full-length wild-type Rb cloned into\nBlueScript SK vector followed by subcloning into the pEGFP vector.\nConstructs that expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged\npolypeptides were made in GFP plasmid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto,\nCA) that contains a multiple cloning site downstream from the\ncytomegalovirus early promoter. All cloning procedures were per-\nformed according to standard methods (Sambrook et al., 1989).\nFor construct GFP-Rb \u0003 628C, Rb cDNA was digested\/repaired\nwith BsaHI\/Klenow-EcoRI, and the resulting 0.9-kb fragment was\ncloned into GFPc1 between BglII\/Klenow-EcoRI sites into GFPc 1.\nFor construction of GFP-Rb \u0003 328C, Rb cDNA was digested with\nEcoRI-PstI, and the 0.9-kb fragment was subcloned into GFP-Rb \u0003\n628C between EcoRI-PstI sites.\nFor construct GFP-Rb \u0003 180C, Rb cDNA was digested with EcoRI-\nSspI, and the resulting 1.4-kb fragment was subcloned into\nGFP-Rb 628C between EcoRI-SmaI.\nFor construct GFP-Rb \u0003 300N328C, Rb cDNA was digested with\nEcoRi-PstI, and the 0.9-kb fragment was cloned into GFPc1 be-\ntween EcoRI-PstI sites.\nFor construct GFP-Rb \u0003 300N180C, Rb cDNA was digested with\nEcoRI-SspI, and the resulting 1.4-kb fragment was cloned into\nGFPc-1 between EcoRI-SmaI.\nFor construction of GFP-Rb \u0003 300N, a 3.1-kb Rb cDNA fragment\nwas cloned into GFPc1 between EcoRI-KpnI sites.\nFor construct GFP-Rb \u0003610N, Rb cDNA was digested with BglII-\nBglII, and the resulting 1.8-kb fragment cloned into GFPc1 be-\ntween BglII-BamHI sites.\nFor construction of GFP-Rb \u0003 750N, Rb cDNA was digested with\nSspI-BglII, and the 1.3-kb fragment was cloned into GFPc3 be-\ntween EcoRI\/Klenow-BamHI.\nFor GFP-Rbwt, a 3.1-kb EcoRI-KpnI fragment was subcloned into\nGFP-Rb \u0003 628C between EcoRI-KpnI sites.\nRESULTS\nC-Terminal Domain of Rb Is Both Necessary and\nSufficient for Nuclear Anchorage\nA series of N- and C-terminal deletion constructs of Rb\nfused to GFP (Figure 1a) were created and transiently\nexpressed in HEK293 cells. The molecular weights and the\nexpression levels of GFP-Rb fusion proteins were investi-\ngated by Western blotting of whole cell lysates by using\neither a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Figure 1b) or\nanti-Rb antibodies. As expected all constructs were ex-\npressed at high levels and corresponded to the expected\nmobility of the GFP chimeras. To investigate the cellular\nlocalization of the transiently expressed constructs we\nperformed immunofluorescence microscopy by using\ncells fixed 72 h after transfection. Wild-type GFP-Rb was\ndistributed throughout the nucleoplasm (Figure 2a and\nTable 2) identical to endogenous Rb (Figure 2c). In con-\ntrast, GFP-N terminus was restricted to the cytoplasm and\nwas excluded from the nucleus (Figure 2a and Table 2).\nIdentical patterns were observed with the constructs GFP-\nNA, GFP-A, and GFP-AB (our unpublished data; but see\nTable 2). Because the NLS has been mapped to the C\nterminus of Rb (Zacksenhaus et al., 1993) the cytoplasmic\nlocalization of these constructs was expected. Unexpect-\nedly, the construct GFP-NAB was distributed between the\ncytoplasm and the nucleus (Figure 2a and Table 2). Fi-\nnally, the constructs GFP-ABC, GFP-BC (Table 2), and\nTable 1.

Transfection experiments were\nalso carried out on primary HDF and HeLa cells, reveal-\ning identical results (our unpublished data).\nIn previous reports, Rb was retained in the nucleus after\nextraction with hypotonic solutions in a phosphorylation-\ndependent manner (Mittnacht and Weinberg, 1991). In the\nmodel cell lines used in the current investigation (HDF or\nHEK293) treatment of cells with hypotonic solutions before\nfixation and staining also retained a significant fraction of Rb\nin the nucleus (our unpublished data). Because Rb mutants\nwith internal deletions in a region spanning pockets B and C\nexpressed in some tumor cells were not retained in the\nnucleus (Mittnacht and Weinberg, 1991), nuclear anchorage\nis likely mediated by these subdomains. To determine\nwhether the pocket domains B and C are indeed involved in\nnuclear anchorage, HDF (our unpublished data) and\nHEK293 cells that had been transfected with GFP-Rb chime-\nras were extracted with hypotonic solutions. As expected\nwild-type GFP-Rb was retained in the nuclei of numerous\ncells, similar to endogenous protein (Figure 2b and Table 2).\nFor those cells transfected with constructs that localized to\nthe cytoplasm (e.g., GFP-N terminus; Figure 2b and Table 2)\ncytoplasmic staining was retained in some but not all cells.\nImportantly, for the construct GFP-NAB, which localized to\nthe cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm, only the cytoplasmic\nstaining was retained after extraction with hypotonic solu-\ntions and the nucleoplasmic staining was abolished com-\npletely (Figure 2b and Table 2). All chimeras containing\npocket C, including GFP-ABC, GFP-BC (Table 2), and GFP-C\n(Figure 2b and Table 2) were mostly retained in nuclei, after\nextraction with hypotonic solutions. Thus, all constructs\npossessing pocket C were retained in the nucleus, whereas\nthe construct GFP-NAB, which was partially localized\nwithin the nucleus, was not retained. These data suggest\nthat pocket C contains a motif that is both necessary and\nsufficient for anchorage of Rb in the nucleus.\nLAP2\u0001 and Lamin C Both Bind to C Terminus of Rb\nIn a previous investigation, lamin A was shown to interact\nwith the pocket domain of Rb in blot overlay assays (Ozaki\net al., 1994). To test whether A-type lamins and their nucle-\noskeletal interaction partner LAP2\u0001 interact directly with Rb\npocket C, and might thus be responsible for the nuclear\nanchorage of Rb, we used similar assays. Furthermore, be-\ncause binding of pRb to lamin A has been demonstrated\npreviously using this assay (Ozaki et al., 1994), herein we\nconcentrated on lamin C. Three different GST-fusion con-\nstructs of Rb corresponding to pocket A (aa 379\u2013612),\npocket B (aa 612\u2013792), and pocket C (aa 792\u2013928) were\nresolved on SDS-PAGE (Figure 3b). The resolved proteins\nwere then transferred to nitrocellulose and overlayed with\n[35S]methionine-labeled LAP2\u0001 or lamin C (Figure 3a). Nei-\nther LAP2\u0001 (Figure 3b) nor lamin C (Figure 3c) interacted\nTable 2.

Markiewicz et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell4406\nwith pocket A of Rb. Although lamin C did not interact with\npocket B of Rb (Figure 3c), LAP2\u0001 showed a weak interac-\ntion (Figure 3b). Both lamin C (Figure 3c) and LAP2\u0001 (Figure\n3b) interacted strongly with pocket C of Rb. A GST fusion\nprotein containing the tail domain of lamin C (aa 319\u2013572;\nFigure 3d) represented a positive control in this experiment,\nbecause we have shown previously that LAP2\u0001 and lamin C\nboth interact with this domain (Dechat et al., 2000). Taken\ntogether, these data reveal that LAP2\u0001 and lamin C are both\ncapable of interacting with the nuclear anchorage domain in\nRb and suggest that these proteins are involved in the nu-\nclear anchorage of Rb.\nTo confirm that these interactions also occur under more\nphysiological conditions in cell lysates, GFP-Rb chimeras were\nexpressed in HEK293 cells. Cell extracts were then prepared\nand the GFP-Rb chimeras immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP\nantibodies. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE,\ntransferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with a GFP antibody\nto detect the fusion proteins (Figure 4, b and c) and with a\nLAP2\u0001-specific antibody (Figure 4a). As expected, LAP2\u0001 co-\nimmunoprecipitated with GFP-Rb, GFP-ABC, and GFP-C. In\ncontrast, LAP2\u0001 did not coimmunoprecipitate with GFP-NAB.\nIn contrast, lamin B2, the major lamin in HEK293 cells, did not\ncoprecipitate with GFP-C, excluding the possibility that pocket\nC is a sticky domain (Figure 4d).\nTo determine whether endogenous Rb interacts with\neither LAP2\u0001 or lamin C in cells, we prepared cell extracts\nfrom HDF. LAP2\u0001 was immunoprecipitated from the ex-\ntracts by using an LAP2\u0001-specific antibody (Figure 5a).\nFractions of lamins A\/C and Rb both coimmunoprecipi-\ntated with LAP2\u0001 (Figure 5c). Lamin B2, however, did not\ncoimmunoprecipitate with LAP2\u0001 (Figure 5b). Two forms\nof Rb with slightly different mobility were detected in cell\nextracts (Figure 5c). A faster migrating underphosphory-\nlated form and a slower migrating, more heavily phos-\nphorylated form. The faster migrating form coimmuno-\nprecipitated more efficiently with LAP2\u0001, suggesting that\nLAP2\u0001 binds preferentially the underphosphorylated\nform of Rb. To confirm that the two Rb isoforms were\ndifferentially phosphorylated, we blotted LAP2\u0001 immu-\nnoprecipitates with phosphospecific Rb antibodies. Even\nthough the faster migrating form was quantitatively the\nlargest component of the immunoprecipitate (Figure 5c),\nit was detected less efficiently with the phospho-antibod-\nies (Figure 5d). Thus, the Rb isoform that coprecipitated\npreferentially with LAP2\u0001 was indeed hypophosphory-\nlated.\nAs a control, immunoprecipitation reactions were per-\nformed in parallel with an anti-lamin B2 antibody. Lamin B2\nwas efficiently precipitated from the extract (Figure 5e). Al-\nthough some lamin A\/C did coimmunoprecipitate with\nlamin B2 (Figure 5f), neither LAP2\u0001 (Figure 5g) nor Rb\n(Figure 5h) was detected in lamin B2 immunoprecipitates.\nBecause lamin C and LAP2\u0001 both seemed to bind to pocket\nC of Rb we predicted that Rb would not associate with LAP2\u0001\u2013\nlamin A\/C complexes in cell lines containing certain Rb dele-\ntion mutants. SAOS-2 is an osteosarcoma cell line expressing\nan Rb mutant containing a C-terminal deletion, covering\npocket C (Mittnacht and Weinberg, 1991). Cell extracts were\nprepared from SAOS-2 cells and immunoprecipitated with the\nLAP2\u0001 antibody. LAP2\u0001 and lamins A\/C were both recovered\nefficiently in LAP15 immunoprecipitates (Figure 5, i and k).\nHowever, the Rb deletion mutant was absent (Figure 5j), sug-\ngesting that pocket C is essential for the interaction between Rb\nand LAP2\u0001\u2013lamin A\/C complexes.\nFigure 4.

To obtain evidence for an\ninteraction of the proteins in vivo, we investigated\nwhether induced LAP2\u0001\/lamin A\/C redistribution influ-\nences the distribution of Rb in the nucleus. In recent\npublications, we have shown that dominant negative\nlamin mutants that sequester endogenous A-type lamins\ninto nuclear aggregates (Izumi et al., 2000; Vaughan et al.,\n2001) also sequester LAP2\u0001 into the same aggregates (De-\nchat et al., 2000). If LAP2\u0001 and lamins A\/C do influence\nthe distribution of Rb, sequestration of LAP2\u0001 and lamins\nA\/C into nuclear aggregates should result in a similar\nsequestration of Rb but not other nuclear matrix proteins.\nHEK293 cells were transfected with the dominant nega-\ntive lamin mutant GFP-delta 2\u0001. Transfected cells were\ncostained with different combinations of antibodies to\ndetect lamins A\/C, LAP2\u0001, Rb, and lamin C or as controls\nwith lamin B1 or NuMa. GFP-delta 2\u0001 formed aggregates\nin transfected cells (Figure 6b, f, j, n, s, and v). In the cells\ncontaining aggregates, lamin A\/C (Figure 6c), lamin C (Fig-\nure 6, i and r), LAP2\u0001 (Figure 6, g and w), and a fraction of\nRb (Figure 6, m and t) were all sequestered to the aggregates.\nOther nuclear matrix proteins such as NuMa (Figure 6, k\nand o) and lamin B1 (Figure 6, a and e), however, remained\nnormally distributed. The use of triple fluorescence in these\nexperiments clearly demonstrated that Rb but not other\nnuclear matrix proteins (NuMa and lamin B1) were seques-\nFigure 5.

Triple fluorescence also demonstrated\nthat LAP2\u0001, lamin C, and Rb were all present in the same\naggregates (Figure 6, r\u2013x). Taken together, these experi-\nments show that, when the distribution of lamins A\/C is\nperturbed, the distribution of LAP2\u0001 and a fraction of Rb are\nalso specifically disturbed, supporting the existence of a\ncomplex of these three proteins in the nucleus.\nHypophosphorylated Rb Is Not Anchored in Nucleus\nof Cells Lacking LAP2\u0001\nLAP2\u0001 is expressed in a growth-dependent manner in primary\nskin fibroblasts. By using immunoblotting, LAP2\u0001 is readily\ndetected in exponentially dividing cultures of HDF along with\nphosphorylated forms of Rb (Figure 7a). When HDF were\ninduced to enter quiescence by serum starvation (judged by\nabsence of expression of Ki67; Figure 6c), neither LAP2\u0001 nor\nphospho-isoforms of Rb were detected (Figure 7a). In contrast,\nexpression of hypophosphorylated Rb, lamins A\/C, and lamin\nB1 did not change as cells progressed from a proliferating to a\nquiescent state (Figure 7, a and e). When HDF were induced to\nreenter the cell cycle by serum restimulation, LAP2\u0001 expres-\nsion was slowly increasing between 12 and 30 h after serum\nrestimulation, whereas total Rb protein remained constant\nwithin 30 h of restimulation (Figure 7b). Phospho-isoforms of\nRb were first detected 18 h after serum restimulation (Figure\n7b). Cells entered S phase between 24 and 30 h after serum\nrestimulation as judged by staining with proliferating cell nu-\nclear antigen, a marker for DNA replication (Figure 7d). Con-\nsequently, there is a 12-h period after serum restimulation\nwhen hypophosphorylated Rb is present in HDF in the ab-\nsence of LAP2\u0001.\nWe predicted that hypophoshorylated Rb would be\nsusceptible to extraction between 6 and 12 h after serum\nrestimulation, if LAP2\u0001 is required for its nuclear anchor-\nage. To test this prediction, HDF were extracted to remove\nnonanchored Rb and then costained with DAPI (to detect\nchromatin) and either anti-Rb or anti-LAP2\u0001 antibodies\n(Figure 8, a and b). Six hours after serum restimulation,\nlittle or no LAP2\u0001 was detected in the nuclei of HDF, and\nRb was no longer detected after extraction. LAP2\u0001 was\nmore readily detected 12 h after serum restimulation, and\nat this time Rb could be detected after extraction. Between\n18 and 24 h after serum restimulation, LAP2\u0001 was readily\ndetected and Rb was retained throughout the nucleus of\nextracted cells (Figure 8, a and b). Thirty hours after\nserum restimulation as cells entered S phase and Rb be-\ncame hypophosphorylated (Figure 7, b and d), Rb was no\nlonger detected in the nucleus after extraction, although\nLAP2\u0001 was present in the nucleus (Figure 8, a and b). To\nconfirm and extend these findings, HDF were extracted at\nFigure 7. Changes in the expression of LAP2\u0001 and phospho-Rb in proliferating and quiescent\nHDF. Exponentially dividing HDF where induced to enter a quiescent state by withdrawal of\nserum (a and e). Cells were stained with Ki67 before and after serum withdrawal to confirm that\ncells had entered a quiescent state (c). Cell extracts were prepared from proliferating (P) and\nquiescent cells (Q) and prepared for immunoblotting. Immunoblots were probed with IF8 to\ndetect total Rb, Rb780 to detect phospho-Rb, LAP15 to detect LAP2\u0001 (all in a), and JoL2 to detect\nlamins A\/C or anti-lamin B1 (both in e). Quiescent cells were induced to reenter the cell cycle by\nreaddition of serum to growth media (b and d). Reentry into the cell cycle was monitored by\nimmunostaining with anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen antibodies (d). Cell extracts were\nprepared at 6-h intervals after serum restimulation and used for immunoblotting (b). Immuno-\nblots were probed with IF8 to detect total Rb, Rb780 to detect phospho-Rb, and LAP15 to detect\nLAP2\u0001. Asterisk (*) indicates slowly migrating phosphorylated forms of Rb.\nE. Markiewicz et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell4410\nthe same time intervals after serum restimulation but\nwere prepared for immunoblotting rather than immuno-\nfluorescence. Six and 12 h after serum restimulation, only\na fraction of Rb was insoluble after hypotonic extraction\n(Figure 8, c and d). Significantly more Rb was insoluble\nbetween 18 and 24 h after serum restimulation (Figure 8d)\nwhen levels of LAP2\u0001 had increased (Figure 7b). Thirty\nhours after serum restimulation, the amount of insoluble\nRb declined (Figure 8d) as cells entered S phase (Figure\n7d). These data support the hypothesis that expression of\nLAP2\u0001 is essential for the nuclear anchorage of hypophos-\nphorylated Rb before cells enter S phase.\nDISCUSSION\nLAP2\u0001 and Lamins A\/C Anchor Rb in Nucleus\nIn this investigation, we showed the C pocket to be necessary\nand sufficient for anchorage of GFP-Rb chimeras in the nu-\ncleus. Two nuclear architectural proteins, lamin C and LAP2\u0001,\nbind across this domain in blot overlay assays. LAP2\u0001 binds\nefficiently to hypophosphorylated Rb and lamins A\/C in cell\nextracts, provided that pocket C is present. When LAP2\u0001 and\nlamins A\/C are forced to accumulate into aggregates formed\nby dominant negative lamin mutants, Rb also accumulates in\nthose aggregates. Finally, when LAP2\u0001 is not present in cells\nentering G1 phase from a quiescent state, hypophosphorylated\nRb is not anchored in the nucleus. Taken together, these data\nsuggest that LAP2\u0001 and lamins A\/C have an important role in\nthe nuclear anchorage of Rb.\nIn a previous study, hypophosphorylation of Rb was corre-\nlated with its anchorage (defined by resistance to extraction\nwith hypotonic buffers) in the nucleus (Mittnacht and Wein-\nberg, 1991). The N terminus of Rb had been shown to be\ninvolved in its oligomerization (Hensey et al., 1994) and bind-\ning to proteins located at sites of RNA processing (Durfee et al.,\n1994). These findings gave rise to the suggestion that this\ndomain of Rb may facilitate binding to nuclear bodies. How-\never, loss of nuclear anchorage of Rb occurs in mutant proteins\ncarrying deletions spanning pockets B and C (amino acids\n702\u2013767; Mittnacht and Weinberg, 1991). The behavior of\nGFP-Rb chimeras in our study suggests that sequences located\nin pocket C (amino acids 750\u2013928) are both necessary and\nsufficient for nuclear anchorage. In our studies, GFP-chimeras\nexpressing pocket C are resistant to extraction with hypotonic\nsolution consistent with the Mittnacht and Weinberg data.\nAlthough we cannot exclude the possibility that Rb is anchored\nin the nucleus through both its C-terminal and N-terminal\ndomains, pocket C does have an essential role.\nLAP2\u0001 binds to GST-Rb fragments corresponding to pockets\nB and C; therefore, it seems likely that binding of LAP2\u0001 occurs\nacross these two pocket domains. Moreover, LAP2\u0001 binds\npreferentially (but not exclusively) to hypophosphorylated Rb.\nIn a previous report, lamin A was identified as an Rb binding\nprotein that also associated with the large pocket domain\n(Ozaki et al., 1994). We can confirm that A-type lamins associ-\nate with Rb in blot overlay assays, through pocket C. Based\nupon this evidence LAP2\u0001 and lamins A\/C both seem to be\ninvolved in nuclear anchorage of Rb. Because lamins A\/C and\nLAP2\u0001 have overlapping binding sites but also seem to be\npresent in the same Rb complexes, we propose that the two\nproteins cooperate in anchoring Rb within the nucleus.\nForm and Function of Lamin\u2013LAP2\u0001\u2013Rb Complexes\nSpecific nuclear processes occur within organizational centers\nreferred to as nuclear bodies (reviewed by Lamond and Earn-\nshaw, 1999). Some authors have favored the view that nuclear\nmetabolism occurs on a nucleoskeleton with properties resem-\nbling the intermediate filament cytoskeleton (Hozak et al.,\n1993). Others have suggested that a more local organization is\nFigure 8. Rb is not anchored in the nucleus in the\nabsence of LAP2\u0001. Quiescent HDF were stimulated\nto reenter the cell cycle by refeeding with serum. The\ncells were extracted with hypotonic solution at 6-h\nintervals after restimulation and either stained with\nIF8 (a) to detect Rb, LAP15 to detect LAP2\u0001 (b), or\nimmunoblotted with IF8 (c). The micrographs in a\nand b are two color-merged images in which DAPI\n(blue) is used to stain DNA, IF8 staining is shown in\ngreen, and LAP15 staining is shown in red. Where\nIF8 (a) or LAP15 (b) staining is absent the predomi-\nnant color is blue. In c, total Rb in unextracted cells\nis shown in the left-hand panel (18 h after restimu-\nlation).

If the proposal of\nHarborth and Osborn is true, proteins capable of forming\noligomeric complexes on chromosome surfaces might be suf-\nficient to tether regulatory proteins at those sites. LAP2\u0001 and\nlamins A\/C both posses the properties necessary for formation\nof oligomeric complexes. LAP2\u0001 contains a chromosome bind-\ning domain and its association with chromosomes is regulated\nby protein phosphorylation (Dechat et al., 1998; Vlcek et al.,\n1999). It also exists as oligomers on the surface of chromosomes\nin cell extracts (Dechat et al., 1998). Similarly, lamins A and C\nhave distinct self-assembly properties and are also capable of\nforming oligomers on the surface of chromosomes in vitro\n(Glass and Gerace, 1990). Finally, lamin A\/C localization in-\nfluences the distribution of LAP\u0001 in the nucleus (Dechat et al.,\n2000), suggesting that both proteins interact at the same sites.\nTherefore, one possible mechanism by which LAP2\u0001 and\nlamin A\/C may function is by forming local oligomeric com-\nplexes on chromosome surfaces. Lamin-LAP2\u0001 oligomers\nwould have the capacity to bind Rb at a site (in pocket C)\nadjacent to its E2F binding domains in pockets A and B.\nLamin\/LAP2\u0001 oligomers may thus provide a mechanism for\nenhanced silencing. The presence of lamin\/LAP2\u0001 oligomers\non the surface of chromosomes might provide a platform that\ntethers one or more Rb molecules beside or across a promoter.\nThese oligomers would be expected to be highly stable and\ntherefore may be capable of forming an effective silencing\ncomplex.\nNuclear Tethering and Tumor Formation\nNuclear tethering of Rb seems to be important for its func-\ntion because forms of Rb identified in certain tumors carry\ndeletions spanning pockets B and C. These forms of Rb are\nnot tethered in the nucleus (Mittnacht et al., 1991) and do not\nassociate with LAP2\u0001 and lamins A\/C (Figure 5). If anchor-\nage of Rb to chromatin is necessary for its silencing activi-\nties, loss of this activity might be oncogenic. Because lamins\nA\/C and LAP2\u0001 are involved in nuclear anchorage of Rb,\nloss of expression of one or more of these proteins might also\nbe oncogenic. Consistent with this hypothesis is the loss of\nexpression of lamin A in a wide range of human cancers\n(Venables et al., 2000) We hope to test this hypothesis di-\nrectly using LAP2\u0001 \u0004\/\u0004 mice, which are currently being\nproduced or with the existing lamin A\/C \u0004\/\u0004 mice. The\nnuclear anchorage domain in Rb is also the site of interaction\nwith the c-Abl tyrosine kinase (Welch and Wang, 1993, 1995)\nand MDM2 (Xiao et al., 1995). Therefore, LAP2\u0001 and lamins\nA\/C might compete with c-Abl and MDM2 for binding to\nRb. If this is true, an alternative function for nuclear anchor-\nage may be to regulate the interactions between Rb and\nc-Abl and\/or MDM2.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Prof. Howard Worman (Columbia University, New York,\nNY), Prof. David Lane and Dr. Joost Zomerdick (University of\nDundee, Dundee, United Kingdom) for the supply of lamin and Rb\nconstructs and for the gift of antibodies.
