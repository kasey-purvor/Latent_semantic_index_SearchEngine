Previous studies have suggested that this gaze asymmetry is \npart of the gaze pattern associated with face exploration, but its relation with \nperceptual processing of facial cues is unclear. In this study we recorded participants\u2019 \nsaccadic eye movements while exploring face images under different task instructions \n(free-viewing, judging familiarity and judging facial expression). We observed a \nconsistent left gaze bias in face viewing irrespective of task demands. The probability \nof the first fixation and the proportion of overall fixations directed at the left hemiface \nwere indistinguishable across different task instructions or across different facial \nexpressions. It seems that the left gaze bias is an automatic reflection of hemispheric \nlateralisation in face processing, and is not necessarily correlated with the perceptual \nprocessing of a specific type of facial information. \n \nKeywords: Gaze bias, Faces, Task demands, Human  \n 3\nIntroduction \nAlthough our facial configuration is more or less symmetrical along the \nvertical axis, we are more likely to use facial cues contained in the right side of the \nowners\u2019 face (left side of the viewed face from viewer\u2019s perspective) to facilitate \nperceptual judgement of gender, age, identity, expression, likeness and attractiveness \n(Brady et al. 2005; Burt and Perrett 1997; Butler et al. 2005; Gilbert and Bakan 1973). \nFor instance, when asked to label facial expression of a briefly presented chimeric \nface, in which the left and right side of the viewed face differ in facial expressions, \nviewers tend to base their decision more frequently on the visual input from the \nhemiface appearing in their left visual field (left hemiface). This left perceptual bias in \nface perception is often accompanied by a left gaze bias (LGB) when free eye \nmovements are allowed in face exploration (Bulter et al. 2005; Mertens et al. 1993; \nPhilips and David 1997). That is, the left hemiface is often inspected first and\/or for \nlonger periods. \nWith a novel and complimentary \u2018bubbles technique\u2019 in which participants \nperform face recognition or gender identification task by viewing each face through a \nset of simultaneously presented, randomly allocated small Gaussian windows \ndistributed across the face, researchers also observed that local facial features within \nthe left hemiface (e.g. the left eye) tend to become diagnostic earlier than their \ncounterparts within the right hemiface (Schyns et al. 2002; Vinette et al. 2004). Taken \ntogether, it seems that we can allocate attention quicker or are more sensitive to local \nfacial cues contained in the left hemiface. \nThe LGB in face exploration is related to neither handedness nor eye \ndominance (Leonards and Scott-Samuel 2005). Although the spatial attention bias is \nto the left visual field and in some cultures, a well practised left-to-right directional \n 4\nscanning bias (i.e. reading) may contribute to this gaze asymmetry (Heath et al. 2005; \nNicholls and Roberts 2002; Niemeier et al. 2007; Rhodes 1986; Vaid and Singh \n1989), it is often argued that a right hemisphere advantage in face processing is the \nunderlying mechanism (Burt and Perrett 1997; Butler et al. 2005). Previous \nneurological and neuroimaging studies have consistently demonstrated that the face \nperception is preferentially lateralized in the right hemisphere. Compared to the left \nhemisphere, patients with the right hemisphere damage are more likely to be impaired \nin facial identity and emotion recognition (e.g. De Renzi et al. 1994), and normal \nvolunteers have greater activation in face-sensitive cortical areas (e.g. fusiform face \narea, occipital face area and posterior superior temporal sulcus) within the right \nhemisphere when viewing faces (e.g. Gauthier et al. 2000; Kanwisher et al. 1997). \nGiven that the right hemisphere receives visual input from the left visual field, it \nseems reasonable to hypothesise that the LGB in face exploration is related to the \nright hemisphere bias in face processing. This hypothesis is further supported by \nrecent observations that the LGB is most evident in viewing upright faces, but is less \nor not evident at all in viewing inverted faces (face inversion would dramatically \nimpair the efficiency of normal face processing) and symmetric non-face object or \nlandscape images (Guo et al. 2009; Leonards and Scott-Samuel 2005).  \nInterestingly, this face-related LGB is not restricted to human faces or human \nviewers. A recent study observed a consistent initial gaze bias when human \nparticipants free-viewing human, monkey, dog and cat faces (Guo et al. 2010). The \ngaze asymmetry also occurs in non-human species such as rhesus monkeys (Macaca \nmulatta) and domestic dogs (Canis familiaris). In some animals it is even species-\nsensitive. For instance, pet dogs only demonstrated a LGB towards human faces, but \n 5\nnot towards monkey or dog faces (Guo et al. 2009). Such observations imply a \nbroader adaptive value of this natural gaze asymmetry in social species. \nAlthough the LGB has been suggested by recent studies as the part of gaze \npattern associated with face exploration, its contribution to the perceptual processing \nof facial information is still unclear. When a face is initially presented within a \nviewer\u2019s central visual field, the left hemiface is projected to the face-sensitive right \nhemisphere, where its saliency is more readily evaluated. Hence the LGB could be \ninitiated by the gist perception of facial configuration in an automatic fashion to direct \nviewer\u2019s attention to the left hemiface because of its increased saliency. Alternatively, \nconsidering that the left and right hemiface can transmit the same type of facial cues \nin different intensity and\/or speed (e.g. evoked anger is expressed more intensely in \nour right hemiface; Indersmitten and Gur 2003), the LGB could be actively engaged \nin face processing for the accurate and efficient detection or recognition of specific \nfacial cues.  \nTo examine the potential contribution of the LGB in face processing, in this \nexploratory study we compared participants\u2019 left\/right gaze distribution when \ninspecting face images with different task instructions commonly used in studies of \nface perception (i.e. free-viewing, judging familiarity and judging facial expression). \nFacial identity and facial expression are two extensively studied facial cues. Bruce \nand Young\u2019s influential cognitive model on face perception (1986) proposed that after \nan initial facial structural encoding, facial expression and facial identity are processed \nalong two separate pathways. This model is partly supported by brain-imaging \nobservations that a distributed neural network is engaged in face perception in which \ndifferent brain regions are associated with processing identity and expression cues \n(e.g. Gobbini and Haxby 2007). Recent eye tracking studies also reported that our \n 6\ngaze allocation to different facial regions is systematically manipulated by task \ndemands of judging identity and expressions. Participants scanned the upper-face \nmore than the lower-face in face identification task but the lower-face more than the \nupper-face in expression judgment task (Malcolm et al. 2008). Accordingly, if the \nLGB is associated with analyzing specific facial information, then different cognitive \ndemands may initiate different patterns of gaze asymmetry. If, on the other hand, the \nLGB is \u201can automatic, internally driven initiation of the saccadic exploration of faces\u201d \n(Leonards and Scott-Samuel 2005), then different cognitive demands should not \naffect the pattern of this gaze asymmetry.  \n \n \nMaterial and methods \n30 undergraduate psychology students (10 male, 20 female), age ranging from \n18 to 27 with the mean of 20.5\u00b12.2 (Mean\u00b1SD), volunteered to participate in this \nstudy in return for course credit. All participants have uncorrected normal visual \nacuity. Informed consent was obtained from each participant, and all procedures \ncomplied with the World Medical Association Helsinki Declaration as revised in \nOctober 2008. \nDigitized grey-scale face images were presented through a ViSaGe graphics \nsystem (Cambridge Research Systems) and displayed on a high frequency non-\ninterlaced gamma-corrected colour monitor (1024 \u00d7 768 pixels, 30.0 cd\/m2 \nbackground luminance, 100 Hz frame rate, Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 2070SB). At a \nviewing distance of 57 cm the monitor subtended a visual angle of 40 \u00d7 30\u00b0. \nSixty face images were arranged into 3 presentation blocks with different task \ninstructions (free viewing, judging face familiarity and judging facial expression). In \n 7\neach block, 20 faces had equal proportion in gender, familiarity and facial expression: \n10 male and 10 female faces, 10 familiar and 10 unfamiliar faces, 10 neutral and 10 \nexpressive (5 happy and 5 angry) faces. The unfamiliar faces were sampled from AR \nface database (Martinez and Benavente 1998; see Fig. 1A for examples), and familiar \nfaces were sampled from internet and were chosen from those celebrities with \nfrequent media exposures. We chose face images carefully to make sure that no \nvisible facial marks existed in one side of the face, and all local facial features (e.g. \nshape of the eyes, ears, mouth corners) within the left and right hemiface were more \nor less symmetrical. The faces were gamma-corrected and displayed once in a random \norder at the centre of the screen with a resolution of 600 \u00d7 600 pixels (22 \u00d7 22\u00b0). \nDuring the experiments the participants sat in a chair with their head restrained \nby a chin rest, and viewed the display binocularly. To calibrate eye movement signals, \na small red fixation point (FP, 0.3\u00b0 diameter, 15 cd\/m2 luminance) was displayed \nrandomly at one of 9 positions (3 \u00d7 3 matrix) across the monitor. The distance \nbetween adjacent FP positions was 10\u00b0. The participant was instructed to follow the \nFP and maintain fixation for 1 sec. After the calibration procedure, the trial was \nstarted with an FP displayed on the centre of monitor (also the centre of the \nsuccessively presented face). If the participant maintained fixation for 1 sec (i.e. the \neye position was within 1\u00b0 of the FP), the FP disappeared and an image was presented \nfor 3 sec. For each presentation block, the participant viewed the faces with the task \ninstruction of \u201cviewing faces as you normally do\u201d or \u201cjudging face familiarity with an \nanswer of yes or no\u201d or \u201cjudging facial expression with an answer of neutral, happy or \nangry\u201d. When required to make the fame or expression judgement, the participants \nhad to give verbal response as soon as the face image disappeared. No reinforcement \nwas given during this procedure and the inter-trial interval was set to 2 sec. The order \n 8\nof the presentation block and task instruction was randomised and counterbalanced \nfor each participant, and a short break was encouraged after each presentation block. \nAll participants completed 3 presentation blocks, and correctly identified all familiar \nfaces in the familiarity judgement block and correctly labelled the facial expressions \nin the expression judgement block. \nHorizontal and vertical eye positions were measured using a Video Eyetracker \nToolbox with 50 Hz sampling frequency and up to 0.25\u00b0 accuracy (Cambridge \nResearch Systems). The software developed in Matlab computed horizontal and \nvertical eye displacement signals as a function of time to determine eye velocity and \nposition. Saccadic eye movements were detected on the basis of their spatiotemporal \ncharacteristics. A sample belonged to a saccade if the eye displacement was greater \nthan 0.2\u00b0 at a velocity of faster than 20 deg\/s. Fixation locations were then extracted \nfrom raw eye tracking data using velocity (less than 0.2\u00b0 eye displacement at a \nvelocity of less than 20\u00b0\/s) and duration (greater than 50 ms) criteria (Guo et al. \n2006).  \nFor each trial we measured the direction of the first saccade (towards the left \nor right hemiface) after image presentation, and the number of fixations within the left \nand right hemiface as a percentage of total number of fixations within the whole face \nsampled in this trial. A lateralisation index, (R-L)\/(R+L), was then calculated to \nassess the extent of the LGB for both the first saccade and overall fixation \ndistribution. R and L represent the number of rightward and leftward initial saccades, \nor the proportion of fixations within the left and right hemiface. An index of 0 \nindicates no gaze bias, whereas a score between -1 and 0 indicates a LGB. \n \n \n 9\nResults \nIrrespective of the task instructions, our participants demonstrated a consistent \nLGB during face exploration. In comparison with the right hemiface, on average the \nleft hemiface had a much higher probability (\u226566%) to be the first saccade destination \n(see Fig. 1B for the first saccade allocation across all the trials) and attracted more \nfixations during 3-second image presentation time (\u226557% of total fixations per \nimage). One-sample t-test (testing against 50%) revealed that such leftward bias for \nthe first saccade direction and overall fixation distribution was clearly above-chance \n(all ps < 0.02). The task instructions, on the other hand, had no significant impact on \nthe lateralisation index (the magnitude of the leftward bias) for both the first saccade \ndirection (one way repeated-measures ANOVA, F2,58 = 0.52, p = 0.6; Fig. 1C) and \noverall fixation distribution (F2,58 = 1.51, p = 0.23). It seems that the face-related LGB \nis not sensitive to the explicit cognitive demand in processing of specific facial \ninformation. \nAnalyzing sequential fixation placement between the left and right hemiface \ncould provide valuable information about the temporal organisation of the LGB in \nface processing. To examine whether spatial allocation of the sequential fixations was \ninfluenced by different task instructions, we compared the first five fixation \nplacements in each image, and plotted the lateralisation index as a function of fixation \nsequence in Fig. 2A. 5 (fixation sequences) \u00d7 3 (task instructions) ANOVA revealed \nthat the left hemiface had a higher probability to be inspected at the initial stage of \nface viewing, but this probability was decreased after the first fixation (F4,116 = 3.61, p \n= 0.008, \u03b7p2 = 0.11). The task instructions, again, had no significant influence on \nsequential fixation allocation on the left hemiface (F2,58 = 2.03, p = 0.14). In addition, \nno significant interaction was observed between fixation sequence and task \n 10\ninstructions (F8,232 = 0.72, p = 0.68), suggesting that the temporal organisation of the \nLGB in face viewing was not affected by different task instructions.  \nFig. 2A clearly demonstrated that the degree of the LGB was more evident for \nthe first fixation than the subsequent fixations in face viewing. To examine whether \nthe LGB in overall fixation distribution was simply caused by the strongest leftward \nbias of the initial fixation, we re-analyzed the overall fixation distribution without the \nfirst one (ensuing fixation distribution) for each trial. One-sample t-tests revealed \neven when the first fixation was not taken into account, the left hemiface still attracted \nabove-chance proportion of the fixations in face viewing (>55% of total fixations per \nimage; all ps < 0.03). The task instructions, on the other hand, had no significant \nimpact on the lateralisation index (F2,58 = 1.93, p = 0.15; Fig. 2B). It seems that both \nthe first and successive fixations contributed to the development of the LGB in face \nexploration. \nAmong various information a face can provide (e.g. an individual\u2019s gender, \nage, familiarity, intention and mental state), facial expression can be transmitted in \ndifferent intensity at different speed between the left and right hemiface (Borod et al. \n1997; Indersmitten and Gur 2003). Considering that (1) in this study the image set \nused for each task had equal proportion of neutral and expressive faces, (2) the task \ninstruction had no significant influence on the LGB, and (3) the facial expression can \nbe processed as quickly as 100 ms or even less (Kirouac and Dor\u00e9 1984; Willis and \nTodorov 2006); we re-grouped each participant\u2019s data sampled from 60 face viewing \ntrials according to the face valence (neutral, angry and happy expressions) to examine \nwhether the LGB was influenced by different facial expressions. One way repeated-\nmeasures ANOVA revealed non-significant effect of the facial expressions on the first \nsaccade direction towards the left hemiface (F2,58 = 1.34, p = 0.27; Fig. 3A), ensuing \n 11\nleftward fixation distribution (overall fixation distribution without the first fixation, \nF2,58 = 0.42, p = 0.66; Fig. 3B), and overall leftward fixation distribution (F2,58 = 0.24, \np = 0.79). It seems that the proportion of the first fixation (>68%), ensuing fixations \n(>56%) and overall fixations (>59%) directed at the left hemiface were not \nsignificantly different across three facial expressions. \nGiven that we have not found a clear impact of the task instructions on the \nLGB, it could be argued that our participants might simply not have engaged in these \ntasks. This is unlikely because our analysis of behavioural responses showed that all \nparticipants have correctly identified familiar faces in the familiarity judgement block \nand correctly labelled facial expressions in the expression judgement block. \nAlternatively, the different task instructions may have engaged the same scanning \nstrategy to sample relevant facial information for different task demands. To \ninvestigate this possibility, we examined whether the fixation distribution within a \nface was affected by different task instructions. As majority of the fixations (>87%) \nwere directed at key internal facial features (i.e. eyes, nose and mouth) in face \nexploration, we compared the proportion of fixations allocated at each of these key \nfeatures between task demands (Fig. 4A). While determining fixation allocation \nwithin a face, the criteria adopted from Barton et al. (2006) were used to define \nboundaries between local facial features and to ensure equal size of the key features \nacross different faces. The proportion of the area of a particular facial feature relative \nto the whole image was further subtracted from the proportion of the fixations \ndirected at that facial feature in a given trial. Any difference in fixation distribution \nabove zero means that this particular facial feature has attracted more fixations than \npredicted by a uniform looking strategy (Dahl et al. 2009; Guo et al. 2010). 3 (task \ninstructions) \u00d7 3 (local facial features) ANOVA showed significant main effects of \n 12\ntask instruction (F2,58 = 7.45, p = 0.001, \u03b7p2 = 0.20) and local facial feature (F2,58 = \n38.56, p < 0.001, \u03b7p2 = 0.57). Specifically, the participants directed significantly \nhigher proportion of fixations towards the mouth region in the expression judgements \n(13% of normalised total fixations within a trial) than in the free viewing (5%) and \nfamiliarity judgements (6%) (post hoc t-test, p<0.001). The eyes and nose region, on \nthe other hand, attracted the same proportion of fixations in different viewing \nconditions. \n As the task instructions only modulated the amount of fixations allocated at \nthe mouth region, we further examined whether the LGB for the mouth fixations \ncould be affected by the task demands (Fig. 4B). On average, the left mouth attracted \nsignificantly more fixations than the right mouth under all three task instructions \n(>63% of total mouth fixations; all ps < 0.01), but the lateralisation index of the \nmouth fixations was indistinguishable across different viewing conditions (ANOVA, \nF2,58 = 0.13, p = 0.88). Taken together, it seems that different task instructions could \ninduce different gaze distribution within the internal facial regions, but identical gaze \ndistribution between the left and right hemiface. \n \n \nDiscussion \nUsing images of human faces, previous studies have demonstrated a clear \nLGB associated with face viewing.  This gaze asymmetry normally occur as early as \nthe first fixation if the face is presented at the central vision  (e.g. Bulter et al. 2005; \nGuo et al. 2010; Mertens et al. 1993; Philips and David 1997), or the second fixation \nif the face is presented at parafovea or periphery region (e.g. van Belle et al. 2010). \nThe LGB is not evident at all or is significantly reduced in viewing of symmetric non-\n 13\nface object or landscape images (Guo et al. 2009; Leonards and Scott-Samuel 2005), \nsuggesting it is dissociable from general leftward bias in the spatial attention as \nrevealed by studies on pseudoneglect with line bisection or similar tasks (e.g. Jewell \nand McCourt 2000). The LGB is further sensitive to the face orientation (i.e. face \ninversion would abolish or significantly decrease the magnitude of the LGB) (Guo et \nal. 2009; Leonards and Scott-Samuel 2005), suggesting it could be associated with the \nface perception. Indeed in a few separate experiments with chimeric faces or full-face \nphotos as visual stimuli, participants showed the LGB while performing memory task \n(Mertens et al. 1993), gender categorization (Bulter et al. 2005) or expression \ncategorization task (Philips and David 1997). In this study with carefully-controlled \nrealistic face pictures, we directly compared this gaze asymmetry while the same \ngroup of participants explored these faces with different cognitive demands. We \nobserved that the LGB is not restricted to the free-viewing task (e.g. Guo et al. 2009, \n2010) or to the processing of a specific type of facial information. As a population our \nparticipants demonstrated the consistent LGB in free-viewing faces, judging face \nfamiliarity and labelling facial expressions, suggesting that the LGB could be \nintimately tied to the normal eye scanning patterns in the processing of various facial \ncues. \nNaturally the follow-up question would be the role of the LGB in face \nperception. Is it an additional reflection of the hemispheric lateralisation in face \nprocessing? Or is it part of the gaze pattern associated with sampling salient\/relevant \nfacial information from local facial features according to the ongoing cognitive \ndemand? A recent study by Butler at al. (2005) shed some light into this question. \nWhen asked to judge the gender of a chimeric face, the first fixation tended to be \ndirected at the left hemiface irrespective of perceptual decision. Within a trial, the \n 14\noverall fixation distribution on the left and right hemiface did not show a directional \nbias, but on trials where participants based their decision on gender cues contained in \nthe left side of the chimeric face, they fixated more often and\/or longer on the left \nhemiface. The authors suggested that the initial leftward saccade reflects the right \nhemisphere bias in face processing, and could be initiated by the gist perception of \nfacial configuration in an automatic fashion regardless of detailed facial information \n(Butler at al. 2005). The leftward bias for overall fixation pattern, on the other hand, \ncould be perception-dependent and associated with acquiring relevant facial cues. \nHowever, due to the nature of the chimeric faces used in their study, the degree of the \nLGB for overall fixation distribution could be underestimated as the participants \ncould be puzzled by the conflicting gender cues contained in the left and right \nhemiface and hence directed equal share of fixations on both side of faces. \nWith realistic face pictures, in this study we observed a consistent leftward \nbias for both the initial saccade and overall fixation distribution irrespective of \nongoing perceptual processes. The stronger leftward bias at the initial stage of face \nviewing (Fig. 1D) suggests that the processing of the gist facial configuration plays a \ncentral role in developing the LGB. Furthermore, its indistinguishable magnitude \nacross different task instructions suggests that the LGB is not sensitive to the \nacquiring or processing of specific facial information, and may not be perception-\ndependent. In other words, it seems that the LGB is an automatic reflection of \nhemispheric lateralisation in face processing, and is not necessarily correlated with the \nperceptual processing of a specific type of facial information. \nIn addition to processing facial information such as gender and familiarity, the \nright hemisphere is also dominant in processing emotional cues (Haxby et al. 2000). \nCompared with judging gender or identity of a chimeric face, observers often \n 15\ndemonstrate a stronger left perceptual bias in judging facial expression of a chimeric \nface (Coolican et al. 2008; Luh et al. 1991; Mattingley et al. 1993), indicating that  the \ncognitive demand for processing facial expressions could enhance the left perceptual \nbias in face perception. Contrary to its influence on the left perceptual bias, here we \nobserved that processing facial expressions had no enhancement effect on the LGB. \nThe magnitudes of the LGB for both the initial and overall fixation distributions were \nindistinguishable across the tasks of free-viewing, familiarity judgement and \nexpression judgement, and across the faces with neutral, happy and angry expressions. \nAlthough there are other factors that may account for this discrepancy between the \nleft perceptual bias and the LGB, such as differences in facial structures (i.e. chimeric \nfaces vs realistic faces) and different facial expressions used in different studies which \ncould induce different patterns of functional brain asymmetry (Murphy et al. 2003), it \nis also possible that the LGB is predominantly induced by the general facial structures \nor configurations, and does not have to be correlated with the left perceptual bias. \n \n \nReference \n \nBarton, J.

(B) Overall distribution \nof the first fixation on a typical face. Each black dot represents the first saccade \ndestination sampled from one face-viewing trial. (C) Lateralisation index of the initial \nsaccade towards the left and right hemiface in free-viewing, judging familiarity and \njudging facial expression conditions. Error bars indicate 1 SEM. \n \nFigure 2. (A) Lateralisation index of the first five fixations during free-viewing, \nfamiliarity judgement and expression judgement. (B) Lateralisation index of ensuing \nfixation distribution (overall fixation distribution without the first one) sampled in \nthree different testing conditions. Error bars indicate 1 SEM. \n \nFigure 3. Lateralisation index of the initial saccade (A) and ensuing fixation \ndistribution (B) within faces of neutral, happy and angry expressions. Error bars \nindicate 1 SEM. \n \nFigure 4. (A) Number of fixations directed at eyes, nose and mouth region as a \npercentage of the total number of fixations within whole face images. The pattern of \nfixation distribution was compared across free-viewing, judging familiarity and \njudging facial expression conditions. The proportion of fixations directed at each \nfacial region was normalised according to the area of the facial region. Any difference \nin fixation distribution above zero means that this particular facial region was \ninspected more than predicted by a uniform looking strategy. (B) Lateralisation index \nof fixation distribution within the mouth region sampled in three different testing \nconditions. Errors bars indicate 1 SEM. \n 21\nFigure 1 \n \n \n   A \n \n                                 B \n \n-0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6\nTa\nsk\nLateralisation index\nC\nLeft                       Right\nFree view ing\nJudging expression\nJudging familiarity\nFirst saccade\n \n \n \n \n 22\nFigure 2 \n \n \n \n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0 1 2 3 4 5\nFixation sequence\nLa\nte\nra\nlis\nat\nio\nn \nin\nde\nx\nFree view ing\nJudging familarity\nJudging expression\nA\nLe\n f \nt  \n   \n  R\nig\nht\n \n-0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6\nTa\nsk\nLateralisation index\nB\nLeft                       Right\nFree view ing\nJudging expression\nJudging familiarity\nEnsuing fixations\n  \n \n 23\nFigure 3 \n \n \n \n-0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6\nE\nxp\nre\nss\nio\nn\nLateralisation index\nA\nLeft                       Right\nNeutral\nAngry\nHappy\nFirst saccade\n-0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6\nE\nxp\nre\nss\nio\nn\nLateralisation index\nB\nLeft                       Right\nNeutral\nAngry\nHappy\nEnsuing fixations\n \n \n \n 24\nFigure 4 \n \n \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nP\nro\npo\nrti\non\n o\nf f\nix\nat\nio\nns\n (%\n) Free viewing\nJudging familiarity\nJudging expression\n  Eyes            Nose          Mouth\nA\n \n-0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6\nTa\nsk\nLateralisation index\nB\nLeft                       Right\nFree view ing\nJudging expression\nJudging familiarity\nFixations at mouth area\n \n \n"}
