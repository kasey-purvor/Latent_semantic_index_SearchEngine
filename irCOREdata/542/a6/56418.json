Measurements of SSA \u2013 commonly undertaken by BET4\nnitrogen adsorption \u2013 are relatively costly in terms of instrumentation and operator5\ntime. We present a novel approach for estimating fine (< 150\ud707m) stream bed sedi-6\nment SSA from their geochemistry \u2013 after removal of organic matter \u2013 for agricultural7\nheadwater catchments across 15 400 km2 of central England. From a regional set of8\n1972 stream bed sediment sites with common characteristics for which geochemical9\ndata were available, we selected 60 samples \u2013 based on maximising their variation in10\naluminium concentrations \u2013 and measured their BET SSA by nitrogen adsorption. Af-11\nter careful selection of potential regression predictors following a principal component12\nanalysis and removal of subset of samples with the largest Mo concentrations (> 2.5 mg13\nkg\u22121), we identified four elements as significant predictors of SSA (ordered by decreas-14\ning predictive power): V>Ca>Al>Rb. Our optimum model from these five elements15\naccounted for 73% of the variation in bed sediment SSA (range 6 to 46 m2g\u22121) with16\na root mean squared error of prediction \u2013 based on leave-one-out cross validation \u2013 of17\n6.3 m2g\u22121. We believe V is the most significant predictor because its concentration18\nis strongly correlated both with the quantity of Fe-oxides and clay minerals in the19\nstream bed sediments, which dominate sediment SSA. Sample heterogeneity in SSA \u201320\nbased on triplicate measurements of subsamples \u2013 was a substantial source of variation21\n(standard error=2.2 m2g\u22121) which cannot be accounted for in our regression model.22\nWe used our model to estimate bed sediment SSA at the other 1792 sites and23\nat 30 duplicate sites where an extra sediment sample had been collected, 25 metres24\nfrom the original site. By delineating sub-catchments for our headwater sediment sites25\nwe selected only those sub-catchments with a dominant (> 50% of the sub-catchment26\narea) bedrock formation and land use type; the bedrock and land use classes accounted27\nfor 39 and 7% of the variation in bed sediment SSA, respectively. Variation in esti-28\n2\nmated, fine bed sediment SSA from the paired, duplicate sediment sites was small (2.729\nm2g\u22121), showing that local variation in SSA at stream sites is modest when compared30\nto that between catchments. We discuss how our approach might be applied in other31\nenvironments and its potential limitations.32\nKeywords: bed sediment, England, vanadium, agricultural catchments, phosphorus,33\nland use, geology34\n1. Introduction35\nSpecific surface area (SSA) is a fundamental material property of solids often expressed36\nas total surface area per unit of mass. In both soil and stream sediments, SSA is a37\ndominant factor controlling particle surface reactions and is closely related to a range of38\nchemical properties that also influence biological processes. For example, surface area is39\nstrongly correlated with cation exchange capacity (Petersen et al., 1996), the dominant40\nfactor determining the magnitude and type of adsorption-desorption reactions between41\ndissolved ions and mineral surfaces in soil pore waters and stream beds. Specific surface42\narea may exert an important control on phosphate sorption. Where sediments are43\ndominated by fine-fraction minerals \u2013 clay-size particles and associated amorphous Fe44\nand Al hydr(oxide) coatings \u2013 they also have a larger SSA for phosphorus sorption45\n(Horowitz and Elrick, 1987) which has significant implications for water quality in46\nagricultural catchments (Withers and Jarvie, 2008).47\nThe heterogeneity of physical stream bed habitats \u2013 dominated by the size and48\nsurface texture of sediment \u2013 has been shown to have a significant impact on primary49\nproductivity of stream algae and respiration of benthic biofilms (Cardinale et al., 2002)50\nthus controlling ecosystem-level processes. Also, larger quantities of organic matter51\ntend to occur in sediments with greater SSAs (Mayer, 1994), although this is by no52\nmeans a universal relationship (Galy et al., 2008). Interactions between organic matter53\nand mineral surfaces leads to occlusion of the latter and the formation of aggregates54\n3\n(Horowitz and Elrick, 1987); the SSA of sediment before and after removal of associated55\norganic matter may be quite different (Wagai et al., 2009). In this study, we focus on56\nthe SSA of the mineral component of fine sediments \u2013 collected beneath the oxic layer57\nof the stream bed \u2013 after the removal of organic matter.58\nFor weathered granular materials encountered at the Earth\u2019s surface, one ap-59\nproach for estimating sediment SSA is to measure the particle size distribution and60\nmake assumptions about particle shape, but this does not account for the area as-61\nsociated with surface textures which can be very large for certain minerals such as62\niron-oxides and expansible clay. The SSA of a material which includes the fine struc-63\nture and texture of the particles is typically measured by gas adsorption using the64\nBET isotherm (Brunauer et al., 1938). Specific surface area measurement based on the65\nBET isotherm \u2013 commonly applied using nitrogen gas \u2013 is relatively costly in terms of66\ninstrumentation, and requires a reasonable amount of time for sample preparation and67\ninstrument operation. Alternative, cost-effective approaches for accurate estimation of68\nSSA include visible and near infra red diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR-DRS;69\nBen-Dor and Banin, 1995); in their study the authors accounted for 70% of the vari-70\nation in SSA in 91 soil samples using multiple linear regression analysis of the soil71\nspectra. An advantage of VNIR-DRS is that quartz has no spectral signature in the72\nvisible and near infra red range; those mineral phases with larger surface areas \u2013 such73\nas amorphous iron-oxides and clay minerals \u2013 are dominant features of the spectra.74\nA recent study demonstrated that the particle size fractions of soil can be esti-75\nmated accurately from its geochemistry (Rawlins et al., 2009). The fact that the SSA76\nof fine bed sediment is related to the naturally occurring elements in that sediment77\nsuggest that it might also be predicted from its elemental composition. Our knowl-78\nedge of geochemistry and mineralogy would suggest certain elements are likely to be79\nstrongly correlated with SSA; aluminium because of its occurrence in clay minerals and80\nFe and Mn associated with their amorphous oxides (Wang et al., 1997). Strong linear81\ncorrelations (\ud45f > 0.9) between several elements (e.g. Al, Fe and Cr) in fine (< 125\ud707m)82\n4\nbed sediments and their SSA were demonstrated for 17 samples from a range of sites83\nacross the USA (Horowitz and Elrick, 1987). However, the diverse range of chemical84\nprocesses \u2013 Fe and Mn oxyhydroxide precipitation, changes in redox potential with85\ndepth from the sediment water interface \u2013 operating in the stream environment may86\nbe too complex for consistent relationships to be observed.87\nThe increasing availability of comprehensive geochemical data for fine bed sed-88\niments from international (Salminen et al., 2005) and national-scale (Johnson et al.,89\n2005) surveys of both large and small catchments makes assessment of the relationship90\nbetween bed sediment geochemical composition and SSA achievable. The availability91\nof accurate estimates of SSA for a large number of sites could help to determine the92\nrelative importance of landscape factors \u2013 such as bedrock geology and land use \u2013 on93\nthe SSA of fine bed sediment. Based on the strong positive relationships observed be-94\ntween SSA and the proportion of the finest (< 2\ud707m) sediment size fractions (Horowitz95\nand Elrick, 1987), estimates of SSA for many headwater streams could help to identify96\nsignificant sources of the finest sediment to large catchment systems and the mitigation97\nof their impacts through strategic management (Owens et al., 2005).98\nIn this paper we present our investigation of the relations between SSA and99\nelemental composition of fine fraction, headwater stream bed sediments across a large100\nregion of central England. We explored the geochemical data and established that there101\nare strong linear relations with SSA. We sought the most effective significant multiple102\nregression equations for prediction from the data that we have from the regional surveys103\nof stream sediments undertaken by the British Geological Survey. We have used our104\nknowledge to select regressors so as to avoid redundancy and misleading inference from105\nchance inclusions of elements.106\nWe present our predictions of fine fraction bed sediment SSA and their errors,107\nand discuss the limitations of our approach. The equations are used to investigate local108\nvariation in bed sediment SSA, and the importance of bedrock geology and land use109\ntype for headwater bed sediment SSA.110\n5\n2. Theory111\n2.1 Multiple regression112\nMultiple linear regression is a standard statistical method for prediction. The regression113\nmodel, expressed in matrix form is114\n\ud466 = zT\ud737 + \ud700 , (1)\nin which z is vector of length \ud45d + 1 containing the values of \ud45d predictor variables plus115\na first element, a dummy, set to 1, \ud737 is a vector of coefficients, the first of which is116\na constant, and \ud700 is a random residual. So, to predict an unknown value, say \ud4660, we117\ncompute its estimate as118\n\ud466\u02c60 = z\nT\n0 \ud737 , (2)\nwhere z0 is the vector of known values for the same sample of bed sediment.119\nWe must first have obtained the coefficients \ud737. If we have data on both the120\nvariable \ud466 and the predictors \ud4671, \ud4672, . . . , \ud467\ud45d for a sample of size \ud45b then we can estimate121\n\ud737 by122\n\ud737\u02c6 =\n(\nZTZ\n)\u22121\nZTy, (3)\nwhere Z is a matrix of dimensions \ud45b\u00d7(\ud45d+1) and vector y is of length \ud45b. The prediction123\nvariance is124\n\ud4602(\ud466\u02c60) = \ud460\n2(\ud466.z) + \ud4602(\ud466.z)z0\n(\nZTZ\n)\u22121\nzT0 , (4)\nwhere \ud4602(\ud466.z) is the variance of the residuals from the regression of \ud466 on z.125\n2.2 Selection of regressors126\nThe British Geological Survey has determined the concentrations of 51 elements in its127\nsurveys of the headwater stream sediments across central England (see Figure 1). Some128\nof these were unlikely to be related to SSA and so these were ignored. This left 21129\nelements to consider (see Methods). To have attempted to predict SSA from all these130\n6\n21 elements in a single model would have entailed two risks, (i) the propagation of errors131\nin the regression coefficients of weak predictors into the final predicted values and (ii)132\nnumerical instability caused by strong correlation among any two or more predictors.133\nA common way of avoiding this difficulty is stepwise addition or elimination of the134\npredictors, but this too carries risks in that the final model can depend on the order135\nin which the variables are considered for addition to (in forward selection) or deletion136\nfrom (in backward elimination) the model. Thus stepwise regression is not necessarily137\nstable.138\nTo minimize the above risks we combined a principal component analysis (PCA)139\nof the 21 variables with judgement based on experience and general understanding of140\ngeochemistry. The PCA showed which groups of variables were strongly correlated to141\none another and enabled us to select only one from each such group so that we should142\navoid instabilities from that source. Using our experience and understanding we chose143\nelements that we thought most likely to be correlated with fine sediment SSA and144\ndescribe the combination of these in Methods.145\n2.3 Centre log-ratio transformation146\nCompositional data, such as comprehensive geochemical analyses which include silicon147\nand aluminium, give rise to a problem in that the components have a constant sum,148\n1 (or 100%), with distributions that are curtailed at the limits of 0 and 1 (or 0 and149\n100%). Standard statistical techniques devised for unconstrained random variables \u2013150\nincluding principal components analysis based on the correlation matrices of vectors of151\nobservations \u2013 cannot be used to analyse compositional data in its raw form. Aitchi-152\nson (1986) proposed a way to avoid this difficulty by using the centred log-ratio (clr)153\ntransformation. If there is a composition X of D elements:154\n\ud44b = [\ud4651, \ud4652, . . . , \ud465\ud437], (5)\nsuch that155\n\ud465\ud456 > 1, 2, . . . , \ud437, (6)\n7\nthe clr transformation of an observation (\ud465\ud456) is:156\n\ud450\ud459\ud45f(\ud44b) = \ud459\ud45b((\ud465\ud456)\/\ud454{(\ud465\ud456)}) (7)\nand where \ud454 is the geometric mean of the elements of the composition:157\n\ud454 = \ud437\n\u221a\n\ud4651 \u00d7 \ud4652 . . .\u00d7 \ud465\ud437. (8)\nWe can analyse the transformed data as we can any other multivariate normal data.158\n3. Methods159\n3.1 Study regions and surveys160\nFigure 1 shows the stream sediment sampling locations of the study region which covers161\naround 15 400 km2 of central England. The stream sediment samples were collected by162\nthe G-BASE project of the British Geological Survey (Johnson et al., 2005). The eleva-163\ntion range across the region is 20 \u2013 255 m above sea level, with undulating topography;164\nthe mean slope angle is around 2.5 \u2218. The stream sediment sampling was undertaken165\nin the summers of 1997, 1998 and 1999 in rural and peri-urban areas. Bedrock in166\nthe study region ranges in age from Precambrian to Cretaceous with a wide range167\nof predominantly sedimentary lithologies including limestones, sandstones, siltstones,168\nmudstones, shale, coal measures, marls, ironstones and chalk (Figure 2). There are also169\nextensive superficial deposits including glacial tills, glacial sands and gravels, marine170\nand river alluvium, river terrace deposits, and to the east of the region, peat deposits171\n(Sylvester-Bradley and Ford, 1968). The soils are dominated by Brown Earths, Surface172\nWater Gleys, Pelosols, Ground Water Gley Soils (Soil Survey of England and Wales,173\n1983a; Soil Survey of England and Wales, 1983b). The land use types include arable174\n(48%), grassland (21%), built-up areas (13%), woodland (7%) and small areas of a175\nrange of other land use types (11%.)176\nPotential stream sampling sites were identified using Ordnance Survey maps.177\nMainly first and second order streams were selected, either avoiding or located upstream178\nof obvious sources of contamination such as road intersections and farm buildings.179\n8\nWhere possible, sediment was collected from central areas of active stream beds after180\nremoval of the upper layer of oxidised sediment. Between 15 and 25 kg of sediment181\nwas wet-screened on site to collect the fraction finer than 150\ud707m typically yielding a182\nfinal mineral mass of approximately 500 g. All samples were returned to a local field183\nbase for air-drying. The location of each stream bed sampling site was recorded using184\na handheld GPS with an accuracy of around 5 m. At site, the width of each stream,185\nstream order and a classification of flow conditions during sampling were recorded. An186\nestimate of the organic matter content of the sediment (low, medium or high) was also187\nrecorded.188\nIn total there were 5047 stream sediment sampling sites across the study region;189\nat sixty-five of these sites, an extra or duplicate sample was collected from a location190\nwithin 25 m of the original sampling site; the same sediment sampling protocol was191\napplied at the duplicate sites. The sites across the study region (n=5047) comprise a192\nrange of : i) stream orders (1st to 4th), ii) flow conditions (no flow to bank full), and193\niii) stream channel sizes (widths of a few feet to several metres). We wished to make194\ncomparisons of fine bed sediment for streams of similar sizes and flow conditions to195\navoid any bias such variation might introduce into our estimates of SSA. We therefore196\nrestricted the number of stream sediment sampling sites to: i) first and second order197\nstreams, ii) low to moderate flow conditions, and iii) streams with channels of between 1198\nand 3 metres width. Of the original 5047 stream sediment sites, a total of 1972 sites met199\nthese conditions. We limited our study to these sites and included 30 of the 65 duplicate200\nsites which also met these conditions. We use the paired sites (original and duplicate)201\nto provide an estimate of the local variation in fine bed sediment composition. Their202\nlocations are shown in Figure 1.203\nOn return to the laboratory, all samples were freeze-dried, coned and quartered204\nand a 50-g sub-sample was ground in an agate planetary ball mill. The total concen-205\ntrations of major and trace elements were determined in each sample by wavelength206\nand energy dispersive XRFS (X-ray fluorescence spectrometry).207\n9\nWe wished to select a subset of 60 samples for SSA measurement. We ranked all208\n1972 samples from smallest to largest by their total Al content because we considered209\nthat Al was the element most likely to be closely related to SSA. We randomly selected210\none sample from equally sized groups of 33 samples from our ranked set to ensure that211\nwe would capture the full range of Al concentrations. We plotted the locations of the212\n60 samples across the study region to check that they were representative of the entire213\nregion, shown in Figure 1. We analysed each of the 60 selected samples for their SSA214\n(see below), and used the remaining samples to estimate SSA from their geochemistry.215\n3.2 Total organic carbon and BET specific surface area analysis216\nTwo sub-samples each weighing approximately 10 g were taken from each of the sixty217\nselected sediments; one for the estimation of total organic carbon (TOC), the other218\nfor SSA. For TOC, each 300 mg sub-sample was treated with a small quantity of219\nHCl (5.7 M) to remove inorganic carbon and total organic carbon was estimated on220\nthe remaining sample by combustion in a Costech ECS4010 Elemental Analyser (EA)221\ncalibrated against an Acetanilide standard. Replicate analysis of well-mixed samples222\nindicated a precision of \u00b1 < 0.1%.223\nPrior to BET SSA analysis, all organic matter was removed from the 60 sub-224\nsamples. Approximately 150 ml of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 30% by weight) was225\nadded to each 10 g subsample in a vessel and placed in a water bath at 60 \u2218C for 3226\nhours. Ethanol was added to reduce effervescence where necessary to prevent loss of227\nsample material. The solution was left overnight and in the morning its temperature228\nwas raised to 100 \u2218C for a few minutes. When the solution had cooled to leave a229\nresidue the same procedure was repeated one or two times until no further reaction230\noccurred. The final sample residue was gently disaggregated with a pestle and mortar.231\nFor each of the sixty samples, approximately 1 g of each sub-sample was weighed232\nout using an accurate, four decimal place mass balance. All samples were prepared233\nusing a Micromeritics Gemini VacPrep Degasser; the samples were degassed overnight234\nat 60 \u2218C prior to SSA analysis. The BET specific surface area of each sample was235\n10\ndetermined using a multi pressure point analysis using a Micromeritics (Norcross, GA,236\nUSA) Gemini VI 2385C series physisorption system. A carbon black standard was237\nanalysed with each batch of samples to monitor accuracy and precision. Triplicate238\nanalyses were undertaken on three separate sub-samples of six representative samples239\nto estimate the degree of sub-sampling heterogeneity. Repeated, triplicate analyses240\nwere also undertaken on six samples to estimate precision.241\n3.3 Landscape analysis242\nWe used a 5 m resolution digital terrain model (DTM; Intermap, 2009) of the study re-243\ngion and hydrological functions in ArcMap9.3TM(ESRI) to generate drainage networks.244\nWe then superimposed on this the locations of each of the 1972 sediment sampling sites245\nand snapped these to the nearest stream, ensuring that where two streams were close246\ntogether, the correct stream had been selected by reference to positions which had been247\nrecorded on hardcopies of Ordnance Survey maps during sample collection. We then248\nused hydrological functions and the DTM to delineate polygons of the sub-catchment249\nareas draining to each of the sampling sites.250\nWe used digital versions of the 1:50 000 maps of bedrock geology of England,251\npart of DigiMap GB of the British Geological Survey (2006) to determine the types252\nand proportions of each bedrock formation which outcrop in each sub-catchment. We253\noverlaid the sub-catchment polygons onto a layer of bedrock polygons with codes for254\neach class in a GIS system, and cut the former into sections using the latter. We255\nthen used the GIS to calculate the proportions of each bedrock type in each sub-256\ncatchment based on the codes for each bedrock formation polygon. We considered257\nincluding the superficial deposits as a further classification but when we added this258\nas another layer the number of polygon classes increased to such an extent that we259\ndecided that statistical analysis and interpretation of the results would have been too260\ncomplex. Using the same procedure, we used a digital version of the 25 m resolution261\nLand Cover Map 2000 (Fuller et al., 2002) for the study region with codes for each262\ndominant habitat type to determine their proportions in each sub-catchment of the263\n11\nsediment sampling sites.264\nTo determine the importance of bedrock formation on estimated bed sediment265\nSSA, we first needed to identify those sub-catchments which were dominated by one266\nlithology or land-use type and remove any catchments which were anomalously large.267\nWe selected those sub-catchments where a single bedrock formation accounted for more268\nthan 50% of the catchment area (n=1340) and where the sub-catchment area was < 40269\nkm2. We applied the same approach to the sub-catchments based on the land cover270\ndata, selecting those which were dominated (> 50% of total area) by one habitat type271\n(n=415). We then used the bedrock and habitat codes for these sub-catchments in272\na one-way analysis of variance to determine their importance for bed sediment SSA273\nbased on our estimates.274\n3.4 Exploratory analysis and choice of predictor variables275\nOf the 51 elements recorded across the study region we chose 21 which seemed likely276\nto be related to SSA. They were as follows (with their detection limits in mg kg\u22121):277\nAl (530), As(1), Ba(5.1), Ca(720), Co(1.2), Cr(1.3) , Fe(70), Ga(0.7), Hf(0.7), K(415),278\nMg(600), Mn(77), Ni(0.6), Rb(0.5), Si(470), Sr(0.6), Ti(120), Th(0.7), U(0.6), V(1.3),279\nand Zr(0.8). In those cases where element concentrations in each sample were below280\nthe detection limit, the concentrations were set to half this value. Table 1 lists their281\nmeans, medians, standard deviations and skewness coefficients, and also their values282\nafter clr transformation.283\nPrior to a principal component analysis, we first closed the composition of the 21284\ngeochemical elements \u2013 ensuring that the sum of each sample is one \u2013 using the closure285\nfunction (clo) in the R package compositions (van den Boogaart et al., 2008). After286\nconverting the data to a compositional data structure using the \u2018acomp\u2019 function we287\napplied the clr transformation (Equation ?? and ??). We then analysed the correlations288\nbetween the principal components of the transformed data based on the correlation289\nmatrix, avoiding the problems typically associated with compositional data analysis.290\nTable 2 lists the leading eigenvalues of the correlation matrix. The first accounts291\n12\nfor more than a quarter (27%) of the variance, the second more than a fifth (21%)292\nand the third, an eight (13%). The first four principal components accounted for 71%293\nof the variance. We converted the eigenvectors to correlation coefficients between the294\ncomponent scores and the original variates by295\n\ud450\ud456\ud457 = \ud44e\ud456\ud457\n\u221a\n\ud463\ud457\/\ud70e2\ud456 , (9)\nwhere \ud44e\ud456\ud457 is the \ud456th element of the \ud457th eigenvector, \ud463\ud457 is the \ud457th eigenvalue, and \ud70e\n2\n\ud456 is296\nthe variance of the \ud456th original variable. The scatter of the coefficients in unit circles in297\nthe planes of the first and second dimensions is plotted in Figure 3a, and first and third298\ndimensions in Figure 3b. In general, the closer the points lie to the circumference of299\none of these circles (i.e. larger correlation coefficients) the better are they represented300\nin that projection. The first principal component (PC) is one of magnitude, whilst the301\nsecond and third PC discriminate.302\nThe elements exhibit a broad range of correlation coefficients with the first PC;303\nthose elements with the largest positive coefficients are Fe, Cr and V; by contrast Ba,304\nHf , K, Mg, Si and Zr, have large negative coefficients. Component 2 discriminates; Rb305\nand Mn having large positive and negative coefficients respectively. Four elements (Al,306\nTi, Ga and Th) which have positive coefficients with the first and second components307\ncluster together in Figure 3a. Uranium has little relation to the other elements in308\nFigure 3a. In Figure 3b, the third PC is dominated by Zr and Hf which have large309\nnegative coefficients. Calcium had the largest correlation coefficient with the fourth310\nprincipal component (not shown).311\nWe chose the following eight elements as potential predictors:312\n1. Fe and Mn because their oxides have large surface areas,313\n2. Al, Ga, K and Rb because of their association with clay minerals and the different314\ncorrelations of the latter with the first three principal components,315\n3. V because it was so strongly correlated with the first principal component,316\n13\n4. Ca because it was strongly correlated with the fourth principal components and is317\na major component in feldspar minerals and carbonates318\n3.5 Building the regression model319\nOur eight predictors for estimating SSA by multiple linear regression do not constitute320\na closed composition; they do not sum to 100% because three of the major elements321\n(Si, Fe, Mg) were not included. We needed to consider whether we should use the clr322\ntransformed data or the original (untransformed) data to fit linear regression models. If323\napplication of the clr transform helps to linearize the relationships between predictors324\nand SSA there would be a basis for its use. However, our exploratory analysis did not325\nshow this, so we used the original, untransformed data to fit linear regression models326\nto the sediment SSA values.327\nInitially we used all 60 analyses of SSA to fit regression models by least squares;328\nhaving relatively few samples we decided to use leave-one-out cross validation to test329\nthe accuracy of the model predictions. Regression models were formed, Equation (??),330\nby forward selection and backward elimination. Four samples had large residual errors331\nwhich we observed in scatterplots of measured and predicted values. When we investi-332\ngated these samples further we noted they all had large Mo concentrations (> 2.5 mg333\nkg\u22121; detection limit 0.8 mg kg\u22121) and their stream bed sampling sites occurred over334\noutcrops of shale bedrock. When we removed these four samples from our dataset the335\nperformance of the regression models improved substantially. We chose to fit regression336\nmodels only to the 56 sediment samples for which we had measured SSA and their total337\nMo concentrations were below this threshold. This eliminated a The models accounted338\nfor a large proportion (71.3%) of the variance in sediment SSA.339\nWe then repeated our regression analysis after removal of a single sample from340\nthe dataset; we used the model formed from the 55 observations to predict the SSA341\nof the sample that had been removed and repeated this sequentially for each of the 56342\n14\nsamples. We then calculated the root-mean-squared-error of prediction (RMSEP):343\nRMSE =\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u23b7 1\n\ud45bV\n\ud45bV\u2211\n\ud456=1\n(\ud467\u02c6\ud456 \u2212 \ud467\ud456)2 , (10)\nwhere \ud467\ud456 is the measured SSA and \ud467\u02c6\ud456 is its predicted value from the regression model.344\nWe also calculated the bias in the estimates.345\nTo investigate the magnitude of local variation in SSA at stream sites, we used346\nthe optimum regression model to estimate SSA for the 30 paired, original and duplicate347\nsampling sites (see Methods). We undertook a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)348\nusing the paired sites as the factor to determine the standard error of SSA (m2g\u22121) and349\nthe coefficient of variation (%). Finally, we investigated the influence of bedrock geology350\nand land use type on fine stream sediment SSA by examining box and whisker plots351\nwhere these factors were classifiers and we undertook one-way ANOVA to calculate the352\namount of variation in bed sediment SSA they account for.353\nA summary of the number of stream sediment sites used in the different compo-354\nnents of this study and the criteria for their selection are presented in Table 3.355\n4. Results356\n4.1 Geochemistry and SSA357\nThe minimum and maximum TOC contents of the 60 samples prior to the removal of358\norganic matter were 1.0 and 8.3%, respectively with a mean content of 3.2%. The SSA359\nof the fine (< 150 \ud707m) bed sediment in the sixty samples varied by almost one order360\nof magnitude ranging from 5.98 to 46.04 m2g\u22121 with a mean of 22.2 m2g\u22121. The SSA361\nfrom repeat analysis of six subsamples had a maximum surface area of 52.16 m2g\u22121.362\nThe correlation between SSA and TOC for the 60 samples was weak (linear Pearson363\ncorrelation \ud45f = 0.02; non-linear Spearman-rank correlation \ud45f = 0.06).364\nThe triplicate analyses of subsamples from six of the sixty samples had a SSA365\nstandard error of 2.2 m2g\u22121 and a coefficient of variation 8.4%. Repeat analyses of the366\nsame subsamples showed the instrument precision was excellent; the standard error of367\nrepeat analyses was 0.035 m2g\u22121 whilst the coefficient of variation was 0.1%. Sample368\n15\nheterogeneity is therefore a significant source of variation in our fine bed sediment SSA369\nanalyses.370\nThe optimum linear regression model accounted for 72.7% (adj \ud4452) of the vari-371\nation in fine bed sediment surface area with a residual standard error of 5.28 m2g\u22121.372\nA scatterplot of measured versus predicted values from application of the regression373\nmodel is shown in Figure 4. The four elements with greatest predictive power were:374\nV>Ca>Al>Rb, in order of decreasing absolute value of \ud461; Table 4 lists the model co-375\nefficients. The root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP; Equation ??) from the376\nleave-one-out cross validation was 6.3 m2 g\u22121 and the bias was \u22120.32 m2 g\u22121. We feel377\nthat the prediction errors and bias are sufficiently small to justify estimation of SSA378\nusing the regression model for the sediments in similar streams across the study region379\nand for the duplicate sites (Figure 5).380\nWe can attempt to interpret the regression coefficients of these predictors us-381\ning our knowledge of mineralogy and geochemistry. Vanadium (V) is the most sig-382\nnificant predictor with a positive coefficient; this may be because Fe-oxyhydroxides383\nformed in soil environments incorporate VIII into their structure (Schwertmann and384\nPfab, 1996). So V may be a useful indicator of the quantity of large SSA amorphous385\nFe-oxyhydroxides (Wang et al., 1997) which have been transported into the stream386\nenvironment. Another potential contribution to larger SSA is the occurrence of V in387\nmicaceous minerals such as roscoelite or VIII in the octahedral position of clay miner-388\nals with substantial SSAs (Breit and Wanty, 1991). Calcium has a negative coefficient389\n(Table 4) and so is negatively correlated with SSA; calcium concentrations may be390\ndominated by its occurrence in carbonate minerals which have a relatively small SSA.391\nAluminium and rubidium (Rb) were also strong predictors and this may be due to392\ntheir occurrence in clay minerals, the latter because of its similar ionic radii with \u2013 and393\nreplacement of \u2013 potassium (K) in K-bearing clay minerals.394\nAfter taking natural logarithms of the measured total P concentrations to reduce395\nthe positive skewness of its distribution (log P skewness= 0.52), log total P had a small396\n16\npositive correlation with estimated SSA (\ud45f = 0.06); we discuss this further below.397\n4.2 Local variation in SSA398\nThe standard error from a one-way analysis of variance for SSA estimated at the 30399\nduplicate sites was 2.7 m2g\u22121 with a coefficient of variation of 12.3%. This suggests400\nthat local variation at stream sites is modest when compared to the range of SSAs,401\nconsidering the standard error of SSA for sub-sample analyses was 2.2 m2g\u22121. This402\nsuggests the vast majority of the variation in SSA occurs either between headwater403\ncatchments or at larger scales along stream reaches, not locally (<25 m) within stream404\nbeds.405\n4.3 Landscape factors406\nThe 10\ud461\u210e and 90\ud461\u210e percentiles of the cumulative distribution of the sub-catchment areas407\nacross the study region were 0.6 and 13.3 km2, respectively; the median was 2.43 km2.408\nThe results of one-way ANOVAs based on bedrock geology and land cover type are409\nshown in Table 5. There were a total of 66 bedrock types which accounted for a410\nlarge proportion (38.7%) of the variation in bed sediment SSA. This is shown in the411\nform of a boxplot for the 20 dominant bedrock formations (Figure 6). The median412\nSSA of bedrock types with larger amounts of coarse quartz (sandstones and siltstones)413\ngenerally have smaller median SSAs than the clay and mudstone lithologies. The414\nNorthampton Sand is an exception; both it and the Marlstone Rock Formation which415\noutcrop in this region are known to contain large quantities of iron mineralisation and416\nassociated arsenic (Appleton et al., 2008). Soils developed over Jurassic ironstones in417\ncentral England are known to contain sedimentary iron oxide phases (Breward, 2007)418\nwhich account for the larger SSAs in the stream bed sediments derived from them.419\nThe land cover types for 90% of the selected sub-catchments were either arable420\n(n=222) or improved grassland (n=174); these were selected because they were dom-421\ninated (area > 50%) by one land cover type. In total there were eight classes of422\ndominant land cover type which accounted for 7% of the variation in bed sediment423\n17\nSSA. Based on an unpaired \ud461-test, the median SSA of the fine bed sediment in the424\narable dominated catchments (21.2 m2g\u22121) was significantly larger (\ud443 = 0.0016) than425\nthe median for the improved grassland dominated catchments (18.1 m2g\u22121) which is426\nconsistent with studies that have shown greater erosion of topsoil occurring in the427\nformer (Fullen, 1997).428\n5. Discussion429\nWe developed a regression model which can make reasonably accurate estimates of430\nfine (< 150\ud707m) bed stream sediment SSA based on four geochemical predictors in431\npredominantly agricultural headwater catchments over a substantial area of lowland432\nEngland, with a broad range of sedimentary bedrock types. Our approach needs to be433\ntested in more diverse geochemical and geomorphological environments, such as upland434\nareas with more acidic streamwater and also for different lithologies such as igneous435\nand metamorphic rocks. The use of sediments sieved to a pre-determined size fraction436\nprovides us with only a partial understanding of the surface area properties of stream437\nbed sediments. If we knew the mass of material required to produce a known mass of438\n< 150\ud707m sediment, we could determine the relative contributions of fine versus more439\ncoarse (>2mm) sediment for SSA of each stream bed.440\nWe chose not to include the distribution of superficial deposits as a further means441\nof classifying headwater catchments to understand the factors which account for vari-442\nation in bed sediment SSA; we took the view it would lead to too many classes \u2013 each443\nwith a small number of catchments \u2013 for our statistical analysis. The amount and444\ndistribution of superficial deposits across the study area is likely to account for part445\nof the variation we observe in bed sediment SSA for individual bedrock types. This446\ncould be explored further using a more complex approach in which the proportions447\nof the bedrock types and superficial deposits are used as predictors in a multiple lin-448\near regression framework, but we considered this was beyond the scope of the current449\nstudy.450\nIn areas of substantial environmental contamination, approaches to the estimation451\n18\nof bed sediment SSA based on geochemical predictors might be prone to significant452\nerror or bias. With the exception of calcium (Ca) \u2013 of which large quantities are453\ndispersed on land through both agricultural lime and cement used in the construction454\nindustry \u2013 our predictors are not typically released in large quantities by anthropogenic455\nactivities. Hence, we believe our approach should be applicable in most earth surface456\nenvironments.457\nOur approach for estimating fine sediment SSA is only likely to be cost-effective458\nwhere geochemical data are available from large scale surveys such as the recent459\ncontinental-scale geochemical survey of Europe (Salminen et al. 2005) in which bed460\nsediments were collected using the same size threshold (< 150\ud707m). Where some or all461\nof the geochemical predictors are unavailable, estimation of fine bed sediment SSA by462\nmid infra-red diffuse reflectance spectrometry (MIR-DRS) may be an effective, alter-463\nnative approach. When we applied MIR-DRS to the ground powders to the 56 in our464\nstudy and used partial least squares regression with spectral wavelengths as predictors465\nto estimate SSA, the RMSEP based on leave-one-out cross validation using four model466\ncomponents was 6.8 m2g\u22121. This is not a great deal larger than the RMSEP from the467\nfour geochemical predictors (6.3 m2 g\u22121).468\nPrevious studies have shown positive correlations between suspended sediment469\nSSA and total phosphorus in lowland streams of England (Evans et al., 2004); we470\nfound a small positive correlation between log total P and estimated sediment SSA for471\n1792 sites in headwater catchments. Our high-resolution estimates of SSA could help to472\nhighlight catchments which have the potential to store large quantities of phosphorus473\nin their fine bed sediment (Ballantine et al., 2009) or act as sources of fine sediment to474\nlarger systems, aiding catchment appraisal and the identification of areas for targeted475\nmanagement (Mainstone et al., 2008).476\n6. Conclusions477\nThe main conclusions from our study are:478\n19\n1. The total concentrations of four elements are sufficient to estimate reasonably479\naccurately the BET SSA of the mineral component of fine bed sediments in480\npredominantly agricultural headwater catchments covering 15 400 km2 of central481\nEngland. The four geochemical predictors \u2013 in order of decreasing predictive482\npower \u2013 were: V>Ca>Al>Rb. We believe V is the most significant predictor483\nbecause it occurs in the structure of both Fe-oxides and certain clay minerals.484\n2. Our model accounted for 73% (adjusted \ud4452) of the variation in fine (< 150\ud707m) bed485\nsediment SSA; the standard error was 5.3 m2g\u22121 across the range 5.98 to 46.0486\nm2g\u22121. The RMSEP from leave-one-out cross validation was 6.7 m2g\u22121 with a487\nsmall negative bias (\u22120.32 m2g\u22121).488\n3. Sample heterogeneity was a significant source of variation in our fine bed sediment489\nSSA analyses; based on triplicate analyses of six samples the standard error was490\n2.2 m2g\u22121 with a coefficient of variation 8.4%. This variation cannot be accounted491\nfor by our linear regression model.492\n4. Based on SSA predictions for 30 paired sites \u2013 where duplicate samples from across493\nthe entire study area were collected at 25 m from their original sampling sites \u2013494\nthe standard error from a one-way analysis of variance for SSA at these paired495\nsites was was 2.7 m2g\u22121 (coefficient of variation of 12.3%). This suggests that496\nthe majority of variation in bed sediment SSA occurs either between headwater497\ncatchments or at larger scales along stream reaches, not locally (<25 m) within498\nstream beds.499\n5. Based on the selection of catchments with a dominant bedrock formation or land500\ncover type (> 50% of the catchment area for each sediment site), these factors501\naccounted for 39 and 7% respectively of the variation in bed sediment SSA across502\nthe study region. Catchments dominated by arable land use at this regional scale503\nhad (statistically significant) larger bed sediment SSAs than those in grassland504\ndominated catchments.505\n20\n6. For the sixty sediments where both SSA and TOC were measured, there was506\nno linear correlation between them (Pearson correlation \ud45f=0.02). There was a507\nsmall positive correlation between log transformed total sediment phosphorus and508\nestimated bed sediment SSA (Pearson correlation \ud45f=0.06).509\nAcknowledgements510\nThis paper is published with the permission of the Executive Director of the British511\nGeological Survey (Natural Environment Research Council).
