However, the effectiveness data used in individual economic \nevaluation was imprecise and unreliable compared with data from systematic \nreviews of effectiveness. Nevertheless, short-term benefits of LS (e.g. shorter \nrecovery) may make LS appear less costly when productivity gains are \nconsidered. \n \n \nKEYWORDS \nEconomic evaluation, cost effectiveness, systematic review, laparoscopic \nsurgery, colorectal cancer \n \n4 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \n1 Introduction \n \nColorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in the Western world and \nis the second most common malignancy in England and Wales in terms both of \nincidence and mortality.  Approximately 36,000 new cases were diagnosed in \n2002 and 17,000 people died from colorectal cancer in the same year.  About \n80% of all patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer (including some with \nadvanced disease) undergo surgery.[1] \n \nOpen resection is currently the standard method for surgical removal of \nprimary colorectal tumours. Minimally invasive approaches to treat colorectal \ndiseases were developed to take advantage of the benefits observed in \nlaparoscopic procedures elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract.[2] Laparoscopic \nsurgery, includes total laparoscopic, laparoscopic assisted and hand assisted \nprocedures. In practical terms a totally laparoscopic and laparoscopically-\nassisted procedure are considered comparable because of the size of incisions \ninvolved. In the remainder of this paper laparoscopic and laparoscopically-\nassisted surgery are referred to as laparoscopic surgery.  In hand assisted \nlaparoscopic surgery (HALS), the surgeon inserts a hand into the abdomen \nwhile pneumoperitoneum is maintained. Some surgeons find this easier than \nlaparoscopic surgery particularly in the transitional phase between \nconventional and laparoscopic surgery.  Advantages claimed for placing the \nhand in the abdomen include tactile feedback, the ability to palpate, blunt \ndissection, organ retraction, control of bleeding, and rapid organ removal.[3-5] \n5 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \n \nLaparoscopic surgery is less invasive and hence may lead to more rapid \nrecovery from the operation but the potential impact on cure rates is unclear.  \nThe major concerns are that tumour recurrence might occur at port sites and \nthat clearance of the tumour may be less complete than during open surgery.  It \nhas also been suggested that the reduced trauma to tissues may lower \ndisruption to the immune system and hence reduce the risk of recurrence.[6]  \nAdditionally, it has been argued that there are disadvantages of laparoscopic \nsurgery relating to the longer length of the operation, the cost of materials, and \nthe effect of surgeon experience on patient outcomes.   \n \nVardulaki and colleagues[7] conducted a review of studies comparing the costs \nof the laparoscopic surgery and open surgery in 2000, (there were no economic \nevaluations available at this time), as part of the health technology assessment \nreview (TAR) carried out by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. Eight \nstudies met their inclusion criteria and they reported that there was no \nsignificant difference in costs between the two procedures in most studies.  \nDifferences in cost were driven mainly by the estimates of cost of \nhospitalisation and time in theatre which varied between studies. Moreover, \nVardulaki and colleagues[7] conducted a costing exercise but did not combine data \non costs with data on effectiveness in an economic evaluation to assess cost-\neffectiveness.  In addition to this, the evidence base (for effectiveness and cost) \nwas very limited as no studies reported long-term outcomes and economic \n6 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \nevidence was of limited quality. Therefore, in terms of efficiency no robust \nconclusions could be drawn from the HTA 2000 report.[7] \n \nSince 2000 the evidence base has expanded and experience with laparoscopic \ntechnique has increased.[1] The present study is a systematic review of the \neconomic evaluations conducted as part of a health technology assessment on \nlaparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer conducted on behalf of the UK\u2019s \nNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Amongst other \nreasons, systematic reviews are important as they can establish whether \nscientific findings are consistent and can be generalisable to other populations \nand\/or settings. Furthermore, explicit methods used in systematic reviews limit \nbias and improve reliability and accuracy of conclusions.  \n \nThe paper reports a systematic review of the economic evaluations of \nlaparoscopic and\/or hand assisted laparoscopic techniques compared to open \nsurgery for the treatment of colorectal cancer. \n \n7 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \n2 Methods  \n \n2.1 Search Strategies \nStudies that reported both costs and outcomes of laparoscopic and\/or HALS \ntechniques compared to open surgery for the treatment of colorectal cancer \nwere sought from a systematic review of the literature.  No language \nrestrictions were imposed but as this review is an update of an earlier review \nconducted in 2000, the searching was limited to studies available between 2000-\n2005.   \n \nDatabases searched were Medline (2000 \u2013 May Week 2 2005), Embase (2000 - \nWeek 21 2005), Medline Extra (23rd May 2005), Science Citation Index (2000 \u2013 \n27th May 2005), National Health Service Economic Evaluations Database -NHS \nEED- (May 2005), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database (May 2005), \nHealth Management Information Consortium (2000 \u2013 May 2005) and Journals @ \nOvid Full Text (2000 \u2013 July 2005 for selected surgical journals).  In addition, \nrecent conference proceedings and reference lists of all included studies were \nscanned to identify additional potentially relevant studies. Other sources of \ninformation consulted included: references in relevant articles; selected experts \nin the field; references of consultees\u2019 submissions to NICE.  Full details of the \nsearch strategies used are available from the authors.  \n \n8 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \n2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria \nTo be included, studies had to compare, in terms of costs and outcomes, \nstrategies involving laparoscopic and\/or HALS compared to open surgery for \ntreatment of colorectal cancer.  Studies were included even if they made no \nformal attempt to relate cost to outcome data in a cost-effectiveness or cost-\nutility analysis.  One reviewer assessed all abstracts for relevance and full \npapers were obtained for those that appeared potentially relevant. \n \n2.3 Data extraction strategy \nThe following data were extracted for each included primary study using the \nframework provided for abstracts prepared for the NHS Economic Evaluation \nDatabase.[8]  \n \na) Study identification information: author and year, interventions studied, type of \neconomic evaluation, country of origin and currency reported; b) the \nintervention, study design and main outcomes: fuller description of treatment, \nnumbers receiving or randomised to each intervention, outcomes studied; c) \nSources of data: effectiveness data, mortality and comorbidity (if measured), cost \ndata, quality of life (if measured); d) methods and study perspective; e) results: \ncosts, benefits, incremental cost-effectiveness\/utility ratio (ICER), sensitivity \nanalyses; f) additional comments relating to the design and reporting of the economic \nevaluation. \n \n9 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \nNo primary outcome was specified although all outcomes were prespecified in \na protocol developed before the study started.  Ideally all these measures might \nbe synthesised into a single unitary measure such as quality adjusted life years \n(QALYs).  In absence of such outcomes, data were abstracted on the following \noutcomes: mortality, survival; disease free survival; recurrences and \ncomplications (this latter outcome was the only one common across all studies).    \n \n2.4 Data synthesis \nIn economic evaluations, as well as in other research areas, is very important to \nknow which methods the authors used to develop their calculations and \nanalyses, as the results could eventually vary widely according to different \nmethodologies used.[9]  For instance, cost categories should be reported and it \nis desirable that health care resource used as well.  Moreover, no matter what \nmethodology is used, any economic evaluation is subject to uncertainty. The \nuncertainty (e.g. the type and sequence of relevant events considered, \nvariability in data, etc.), can be addressed by conducting different types of \nsensitivity analyses.[10]  Sensitivity analyses will tell the reader how reliable the \nresults are.  \n \nOne economist assessed included studies using the NHS-EED guidelines for \nreviewers.[8] This guidelines address all the important issues that should be \nreported when conducting an economic evaluation in health care.  No attempt \nwas made to synthesize quantitatively the primary studies that were identified.  \nData from all included studies were instead summarised and appraised in \n10 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \norder to identify common results, variations and weaknesses between studies.  \nIf a study did not report incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) but \nprovided sufficient data then, where possible, the data were reanalysed to \nprovide estimates of ICERs.  These ICERs are presented for the following \nclinical outcomes: mortality, survival; disease free survival; recurrences and \ncomplications. \n \n3 Results \n \n3.1 Number of studies identified  \nAs a result of the literature searches, 392 study hits after deduplication were \nscreened (Figure 1). From these, a total of 41 studies were selected for full \nassessment. Of these 41 studies, three studies[11-13] met the inclusion criteria.  \nTwo additional unpublished papers (that have since been published) also \nmeeting the inclusion criteria were obtained from experts in the field.[14,15] A \nfurther study that compared laparoscopic surgery against HALS and, as a \nconsequence did not meet the inclusion criteria, was also identified.[16] \n  \n3.2 Study identification and key elements \nTwo studies compared laparoscopic colon resection with open colon resection \nin the treatment of colon cancer,[11,13] one of which focused on right \nhemicolectomy.[13] A further study compared laparoscopic-assisted with \nconventional open resection for rectosigmoid carcinoma,[12] and two compared \n11 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \nlaparoscopic versus open resection for colorectal cancer.[14,15]  One of these \nwas in the context of an enhanced recovery program.[15] \n \nFive studies were classified as cost-consequence analyses.  That is, costs were \ncompared with various different measures of effectiveness.  Two were based on \nsingle centre RCTs[12,15], and two were based on multicentre RCTs.[11,14] The \nfifth study was based on a single centre cohort-matched study conducted in \nChina (Table 1).[13]  Two studies considered costs from a societal \nperspective[11,15] while the others adopted a hospital perspective (Table \n1).[12,13]  Franks and colleagues described their study as a cost analysis but \nincluded data on outcomes sufficient to calculate ICERs.[14]  \n \nThe study by Franks and colleagues represented a preliminary analysis \nconducted on a subset of patients from the CLASICC trial[17] who had agreed \nto be included in the economic analysis.  The dates for data collection were not \nreported. The Swedish study collected data from January 1999 to May 2002;[11] \nthe study by King and colleagues from January 2002 to March 2004,[15] the \nstudy by Leung and colleagues, conducted in Hong Kong, collected data from \nSeptember 1993 to October 2002,[12] and the Chinese study from September \n2002 to February 2003.[13]  In all five studies costs were estimated prospectively \nfrom the same sample as that used for collecting the effectiveness data.[11-15] \n  \n12 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \n3.3 Patient group, study sample and study design \nThe sample sizes in four of the five studies were modest (Table 1).  In the cohort \nmatched study, 30 patients with colon cancer underwent laparoscopic right \nhemicolectomy surgery and were matched with 34 patients who received open \nright hemicolectomy surgery.[13]  Patients for the open surgery group in this \nstudy were matched for gender, age, Dukes\u2019 staging, tumour site, previous \nabdominal operation and extent of resection. 34 patients were randomly \nselected from 87 patients who underwent open surgery during the same period.  \n \nThe analysis in all studies was conducted on an intention to treat basis, \nhowever, the follow-up period as well as the outcome measures varied \nconsiderably between studies (Table 1). \n \n3.4 Methods of economic analysis \nThe four trial based papers[11,12,14,15] presented details on which items were \nincluded in the cost calculations, but no details were reported in the non-\nrandomised study.[13] Such information is useful as data on resource use can \nhelp readers judge the applicability of the study to their setting.  Relatively \ngood details of unit costs were presented in the Swedish and UK \nstudies[11,14,15] while no unit costs were reported in the other two \nstudies.[12,13] In economics, costs occurring into the future are given less \nweight than costs occurring now, i.e. they are discounted.  Discounting was \nperformed only in the Swedish study while it was actually relevant in all \nstudies with a follow-up greater than 12 months.  Indirect costs were calculated \n13 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \nin three of the studies using the human capital approach (time off paid \nwork)[11,14,15] Three papers did not use any summary measure of health \nbenefits[12,13,15] and left the results disaggregated. One study focused \nprimarily on costs.[14] In the Janson and colleagues study, the mean cost per re-\noperated patient for each arm of the trial was presented (although it is not \nreported in this paper).[11]  \n \nAs previously stated, uncertainty is pervasive in every economic evaluation. \nTherefore, authors should allow for this by conducting different types of \nsensitivity analyses. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed in three \nstudies.[11,14,15] Changes in perioperative, equipment, recovery, ICU and \nhospital costs were considered in the study by Franks and colleagues.  They \nalso considered a subgroup analysis by location of cancer (colon or rectum).[14] \nCost per minute for the operating room, anaesthesia and recovery room time \nwere explored in the Swedish study[11] while duration of in-patient stay and \nthe consumption of community resources after discharge were explored in the \nStudy by King and colleagues.[15] \n \n3.5 Cost effectiveness results from the included studies  \nThe results of the included studies are summarised in Table 2.  In Franks and \ncolleagues, total costs, including productivity costs, for both the base-case and \nboth subgroups were not significantly different between the laparoscopic and \nopen groups, although the confidence interval was very wide (mean additional \ncost of laparoscopic surgery was \u00a3268, 95% CI: \u2013690 to 1460). Productivity costs \n14 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \nwere not a major determinant of this additional cost although hospitalisation \ncosts (less for laparoscopic surgery) and costs for re-operations and other \ncomplications (greater for laparoscopic surgery) were.  Although there was no \nevidence of a statistically significant difference in clinical outcomes, confidence \nintervals would be sufficiently wide for clinically and economically important \ndifferences to exist.[14] \n \nIn Janson and colleagues total costs, including productivity loss, were not \nsignificantly different between the laparoscopic surgery and open surgery.  \nHowever, total costs, excluding productivity losses (that is cost to the healthcare \nsystem), were significantly higher for the laparoscopic surgery compared with \nopen surgery (\u20ac9474 vs. \u20ac7235; P=0.018), as were the costs related to the first \nadmission, and the costs of primary surgery.[11] \n \nIn King and colleagues the results reflected the increased duration of \nlaparoscopic procedures and also the increased use of disposable equipment in \ntheatre.  However, in their analysis, King and colleagues found that these costs \nwere more than offset by lower post-operative costs such as re-operations, and \nproductivity cost savings resulting from the earlier return to usual activities.[15] \n \nSimilarly, the health service costs from Leung and colleagues were also higher \nfor laparoscopic surgery than for open surgery and this difference, as with the \nother two RCT-based analyses, was statistically significant (P<0.001).[12]  \n15 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \nHowever, no significant difference was observed in the total cost of operation \nand drugs between the two groups in the Chinese study (Table 2 - CNY1000 \ncirca \u00a365.8 - www.bloomberg.com  5\/02\/2007).[13] \n \nOverall, the magnitude of the mean additional cost of laparoscopic compared \nwith open surgery varied considerably between studies.  For example the \nrelative cost of laparoscopic surgery compared with open surgery varied \nbetween 95%(13) and 130%.[12] \n \nTable 3 reports the estimated ICERs for the different clinical outcomes.  Only \none measure of effectiveness was common across all studies: major \ncomplications.   In terms of mortality (2 studies[11,12]) 5 year survival (1 \nstudy[12]); 5 year disease free survival (1 study[12]) and recurrence (1 \nstudy[12]) it is unlikely that in terms of mean differences costs and outcomes \nthat laparoscopic surgery would be considered cost-effective.  However, \nconfidence intervals would probably be wide enough to include clinically and \neconomically important differences favouring either type of surgery.  Table 3 \nalso reports the number of complications (see Table 1 for types of \ncomplications) in each study. Only two studies reported P-values for the \ndifference between the number of complications in the laparoscopic and open \ngroups[13,15] and in this study the difference was not statistically significant. \nThese results are in line with those of a recent systematic review of effectiveness \nconducted by Murray and colleagues.[1] Murray and colleagues considered \n16 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \ndata from 18 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of general good quality. The \nauthors considered amongst other outcomes, the occurrence of complications \nsuch as anastomotic leakage, abdominal wound breakdown, incisional hernia, \nand wound and urinary tract infections. They found no statistically significant \ndifferences between open and laparoscopic surgery within these outcome \ncategories, although confidence intervals were wide enough for clinically \nimportant differences to exist. \n \nIncremental costs per major complication avoided were calculated using the \ndata from the original studies (Table 3). Based on mean data for costs and \ncomplications open surgery is dominant (i.e. less costly and more effective) in \ntwo studies[11] while in another, laparoscopic surgery was dominant.[15] A \nforth study laparoscopic surgery could avoid a major complication at a cost of \nCNY10,008,[13] (circa \u00a3659). Complications from surgery could be avoided at a \ncost of USD 76,872[12] (approximately \u00a339,220) according to Leung and \ncolleagues. Finally, using data from Franks and colleagues [13] on number of \ntotal complications, using laparoscopic surgery could avoid a complication at \nan extra cost of between \u00a3229,000 and \u00a3268,000.[14]   \n \nOne study conducted a subgroup analysis by location of disease (colon or \nrectum).[14] Overall, surgery for colon cancer was on average approximately \n\u00a33000 less costly than rectal cancer regardless of the method of surgery.  For \nboth subgroups the mean total costs including indirect costs were greater for \n17 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \nlaparoscopic surgery although they were not statistically significant.  When \nindirect costs were excluded laparoscopic surgery was less costly for colon \ncancer but more costly for rectal cancer.  For colon cancer the main drivers of \nthis cost difference was that the higher theatre cost was more than compensated \nby the reduced hospitalisation and complications cost.  For rectum cancer \npatients the higher operation cost for laparoscopic surgery was almost matched \nby the lower hospitalisation costs, but there was a statistically significant higher \ncost of complications following laparoscopic surgery (Table 4).  The sample \nsizes for these subgroup analyses were modest (between 230 and 222 for \nlaparoscopic surgery and 118 to 112 for open surgery for colon and rectum \ncancer respectively) and it is unclear whether the differences in total costs were \nmostly associated with different risks of complications between the surgeries or \ndifferent types of complication occurring.   \n \n4 Discussion  \n \nIn the previous review conducted for NICE on this subject, there was no \neconomic evaluations identified and therefore, no evidence reported on cost-\neffectiveness. Full economic evaluations need to bring together costs and effects \non order to provide information on efficiency; it is the interplay of costs and \neffects that is important. The HTA 2000[7] reported some evidence in costs (e.g. \neight costing studies were identified), and provided an economic costing \nexercise but this in itself does not provide evidence on cost effectiveness. That \nreview found no statistically significant differences in costs between open \n18 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \nsurgery and laparoscopic surgery in the reviewed studies. However, it was \nclear from their effectiveness review[7] that length of stay was consistently \nshorter (although not always statistically significantly shorter) for laparoscopic \nsurgery. \n \nOur study reports evidence on cost-effectiveness and not only on costs and \neffects separately. The four RCT-based analyses identified by this updated \nreview appear to have statistically significant longer operating times for \nlaparoscopic surgery.  This is consistent with the data in the recent review of \neffectiveness reported by Murray and colleagues,[1] even though, the study by \nZheng and colleagues[13] reported no statistically significant difference. With \nrespect to length of hospital stay this appeared to be longer in the open groups: \nagain, a result consistent with the review of effectiveness reported in Murray \nand colleagues.[1] Overall in terms of these findings the results of the review \npresented in this paper are consistent with the earlier more limited findings of \nVardulaki and colleagues.[7] Namely, Verdulaki and colleagues[7]  reported a \noperating time mean difference of 62 minutes (e.g. open shorter) and length of \nhospital stay of -2.14 days (e.g. open longer) between laparoscopic and open \nsurgery, while Murray and colleagues[1] a weighted mean difference of 40 \nminutes and -2.63 days, respectively.  Therefore, the trend in resource use in \nfavour of laparoscopic surgery (shorter operating time difference and longer \nlength of stay difference compare with open surgery) seems to exist but not \n19 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \nwith the strength predicted by Verdulaki and colleagues[7] who concluded that \nthe difference in cost is \u201cexpected to disappear in the next 5 years\u201d.  \n \nThe mean total health care cost of laparoscopic appeared to be greater than \nopen surgery in all studies except in King and colleagues.[15]  However, there \nwas no evidence of a statistically significant difference in total health care cost \nbetween laparoscopic surgery and open surgery, although confidence intervals \nwere wide.  \n \nOne concern with laparoscopic surgery is the conversion rate to open surgery. \nConversions are likely to increase the total cost of laparoscopic surgery as a \nconversion increases operation time. Although as reported by Murray and \ncolleagues,[1] the evidence for comparing converted, non-converted \nlaparoscopic and open patients is limited. It is likely that as experience increases \nthe rates of conversion would fall.  \n \nThe incremental cost per complication avoided, shown in the previous section, \nshould be interpreted extremely cautiously. All the studies had relatively small \nsample sizes and differences in the number of complications (used as the \neffectiveness measure in these calculations) between laparoscopic surgery and \nopen surgery were not statistically significant.  Furthermore, different types of \ncomplications might have different effects in morbidity and, therefore, quality \nof life. Using another measure of effectiveness within the economic evaluation \n20 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \n(e.g. QALYs) might overcome this problem. With respect to the estimates of \ncomplications the estimates of the individual studies are likely to be less reliable \nthan estimates derived from the review of effectiveness provided by Murray \nand colleagues.[1]  Data from their review of effectiveness provides no evidence \nof a difference in complication rates, although confidence intervals were \nsufficiently wide enough for clinically important differences to exist.   \n \nThe measure of total cost used differed substantially between studies.  For \nexample, Franks and colleagues,[14] Janson and colleagues[11] and King and \ncolleagues[15] considered indirect costs while the other two studies considered \nonly direct costs from surgery and hospital stay.[12,13] The costing \nmethodology was also poorly described in these latter two studies.  For \nexample Zheng and colleagues reported only final cost figures and provided no \ndetails on the way calculations were performed.[13] \n \nIt is unclear the extent to which the costs from the three non-UK studies would \nbe applicable to the UK.  One UK study had a very small sample size, and it \nwas based on a single centre.[15] The second UK study had a much larger \nsample size and more precise estimates of cost.  However, both the rate of \nconversions from laparoscopic to open (30%) and the higher rates of \ncomplications following laparoscopic surgery would tend to increase the \ndifference between laparoscopic and open surgery.   \n \n21 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \nThe relatively short follow-up in all studies indicates that a modelling exercise, \nusing the best available effectiveness data with a longer time horizon (e.g. the \ntime over which cost and effects may differ between the treatments), might add \nvaluable information for decision-making. Such an exercise should follow the \nusual guidelines of good practice for conducting an economic \nevaluation.[9,15,18-20] Namely, incorporate the best available effectiveness \nevidence, include all relevant cost categories according to the perspective \nadopted, use a relevant measure of effectiveness (e.g. life years gained, quality \nadjusted life years), and incorporate discounting as the relevant time horizon \nfor the analysis is likely to be longer than a year. This suggests that the best \neconomic evidence should come from a well designed economic model which \nuses the best available data which has been systematically assembled. \n \nRecently, two model based economic evaluations have been published[22,23] \nthat seem to move forward the cost effectiveness. Hayes and colleagues[23] \ndeveloped a simple model and found laparoscopic surgery to be potentially \ncost-effective (e.g. mean incremental cost per QALY $70,389 \u2013 circa \u00a328,296). \nHowever, their results were sensitive to assumptions on the time needed to \nresume normal activities (e.g. between 12 and 33 days), and the cost of \ndisposable equipment used within laparoscopic surgery. Moreover, the authors \nconducted only one way sensitivity analyses. The study by de Verteuil and \ncolleagues[23] reports a more sophisticated analysis based on a Markov model \npopulated with data retrieved from systematic reviews of the literature. The \n22 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \nstudy managed to predict long term outcomes and concluded that laparoscopic \nsurgery. The authors conducted several sensitivity analyses, including \nprobabilistic sensitivity analysis. They concluded that laparoscopic surgery was \nmore costly and has a likelihood of being considered cost effective of between \n30 and 80 percent, depending on assumptions made about survival (e.g. relative \nrisk of 1.03 or 1 \u2013equal\u2013), and disease free survival (e.g. relative risk of 1.03 or 1 \n\u2013equal\u2013).  \n \nIn addition to the studies comparing laparoscopic surgery with open surgery a \nfurther study was identified comparing conventional laparoscopic surgery with \nHALS.[16] The authors concluded, \u201cAlthough it is a more aggressive \nprocedure, HALS preserves the feature of minimally invasive approach, \nmaintains all the oncological features of conventional laparoscopic surgery, and \ndoes not increase the cost.\u201d \n \nOther relevant issues that influence the decision about whether or not to adopt \nLS are speed of patient recovery and surgeon training. Murray and \ncolleagues[1] reported that laparoscopic surgery seems to offer patients some \nshort term quality of life advantages without compromising safety or long term \noutcomes (at least up to three years). However, relatively few surgeons are \ntrained in this form of surgery and this therefore limits access to laparoscopic \nsurgery. Furthermore, a low conversion rate seems to be key for laparoscopic \nsurgery to be beneficial and this depends on experience.[1] Should a decision be \n23 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \ntaken to increase the use of laparoscopic surgery then training programmes \nneed to be put in place,[1] and the cost implications of this need to be \nconsidered before making the final decision on which technology to adopt.   \n \n5 Conclusions \n \nThis study presents the overall evidence available on cost-effectiveness analyses \nof laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer compared to open surgery, based \non a systematic review of the literature.  Laparoscopic surgery generally had \nhigher health care costs than open surgery as the former seems to involve \nlonger operation times and higher equipment costs, although including \nproductivity gains from earlier recovery make laparoscopic surgery appear less \ncostly.  However, the measurement and inclusion of such costs (indirect costs) \nin an economic evaluation is contentious.[18,19] \n \nWith respect to effectiveness, the data used by the individual studies is likely to \nbe imprecise and unreliable when compared to the data available from a recent \nsystematic review of effectiveness.[1] Thus, the evidence provided by the \nincluded economic evaluations using longer-term outcomes such as survival is \nlikely to be imprecise and unreliable. Two more recently and better designed \neconomic evaluations add to the cost-effectiveness evidence. However, their \nresults seem to ratify the need for more data on long-term performance. \n \n24 \n\u201cLap. surg. syst. review economic eval.\u201d \nReferences \n \n \n1  Murray A, Lourenco T, de Verteuil R et al.
