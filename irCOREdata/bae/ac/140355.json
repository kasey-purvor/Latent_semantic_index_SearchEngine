Introduction4\nIn accordance with the EU Landfill Directive, the amount of biodegradable5\nmunicipal waste (BMW) disposed of in landfill needs to be dramatically reduced6\n(Council of the European Union, 1999). The BMW proportion of municipal solid waste7\n(MSW) can be reduced via treatment of the waste material in processes such as8\nmechanical biological treatment (MBT) which involve the separation of solid recovered9\nfuel (SRF) and biological treatments such as composting or anaerobic digestion (Archer10\net al., 2005). Methods of assessing the biodegradable content of input and output11\nmaterials of the treatment processes can provide important information on process12\nperformance and the diversion of BMW from landfill (Wagland et al., 2009). There is a13\ngeneral acceptance that all test methods have their advantages and limitations but the14\nsuitability of the available test methods for routine operational use remains the subject of15\nacademic debate (S\u00e1nchez, 2009; Wagland and Tyrrel, 2010), suggesting a requirement16\nfor further research and development into alternative methods. One such method is the17\nenzymatic hydrolysis test (EHT) (Wagland et al., 2009). This procedure uses a mixture18\nof hemicellulase and cellulase enzymes, under optimum conditions, to hydrolyze the19\nbiodegradable substrate (Wagland et al., 2007). These enzymes are used as BMW20\nconsists of 30-50% lignocellulosic material (Godley et al., 2007a; Rodriguez et al., 2005;21\nWagland et al., 2008), and hemicellulose\/cellulose can contribute to up to 90% of the22\n4total biogas (CO2\/CH4) produced under anaerobic conditions, such as landfill (Barlaz et1\nal., 1989).2\nIn the recent study by Wagland et al (2008) the BM100, DR4 and EHT methods3\nwere applied to a wide range of untreated and treated organic waste materials including4\nMSW, garden waste, food waste and sewage sludge. The BM100 is an anaerobic test5\nmethod which measures the biogas (CO2 and CH4) release over a period of 100 days; and6\nthe DR4 is a dynamic 4 day aerobic test which measures the oxygen consumption of7\nbiodegradable material under aerobic conditions (Wagland et al., 2009). The correlations8\nof the short-term EHT and DR4 methods with the long-term BM100 test method were9\ncompared. The EHT generated a stronger correlation with the BM100 than that of the10\nDR4 (r = 0.77 and 0.58 respectively) indicating that the method has some potential and11\nshould be subject to further testing. The use of the EHT test remains debatable, however,12\ndue to concerns that the test will not register the biodegradable content of wastes with a13\nrelatively low composition of polysaccharides (Wagland et al., 2008). Biological14\nmethods are commonly recognized as suitable approaches, capable of high correlations15\nwith long-term anaerobic methods for specific waste streams and treatment processes16\n(Cossu and Raga, 2008; Pons\u00e1 et al., 2008; S\u00e1nchez, 2009).17\nThe BM100 test for monitoring BMW diversion from landfill has been18\nsuperseded and is now referred to as the biodegradability under methanogenic conditions19\n(BMc) (Environment Agency, 2005; Turrell et al., 2009). Therefore, currently in the UK20\nthe aerobic DR4 and BMc test methods are used to monitor BMW diversion from landfill21\n(Environment Agency, 2005; Godley et al., 2007b; Turrell et al., 2009). In this study the22\nEHT, DR4 and BMc methods were applied to a series of samples taken over a nine month23\n5period from a single MBT facility which employs a 2 week biodrying process. The1\nprincipal aim was to evaluate the performance of EHT as a biodegradability test when2\napplied in the context of the routine monitoring of a waste treatment facility. In addition3\nto monitoring the changes in biodegradability, the waste samples were assessed using4\ndifferent particle sizes for the EHT. The surface area of the waste material is likely to5\naffect the rate and extent to which the enzymes hydrolyze the substrate. It was6\nhypothesized that grinding to smaller sample sizes would result in less variability7\nbetween sample replicates, and so a smaller <2 mm particle size was used in addition to8\nthe standard <10 mm used in the DR4 and BMc test methods. Also the increased surface9\narea: particle volume ratio may result in a significantly higher dissolved organic carbon10\n(DOC) release, which has been observed previously (Dasari and Eric Berson, 2007).11\nTherefore this study investigated the effects of particle size on variation and DOC yield12\nfor the EHT in addition to the monitoring of an MBT process using UK-established13\nbiodegradability test methods, to indicate the suitability of the EHT method for assessing14\nthe biodegradable content of MSW-derived material.15\n16\n2. Methods17\n2.1. Samples18\nThe samples were collected from a single MBT facility located in the south of19\nEngland. This facility receives general mixed MSW collected from the local area. The20\nwaste material is shredded and placed in a large composting hall for 2 weeks where it is21\ndried using the heat generated by microbiological activity (biodrying) before passing22\nthrough a complex separation process (Figure 1).23\n6>>>>>>>>>>>Please insert Figure 1<<<<<<<<<<<<<1\nThe composting halls consist of a perforated floor and ductwork system, which2\nallows air to be drawn downwards through the waste. This aerates the waste material,3\nand also provides the fully enclosed facility with a negative air pressure, which minimises4\nthe release of odours. The biological processes which occur in composting result in5\nincreased temperatures, between 50 and 60\u00b0C, which evaporate the water content of the6\nmaterial resulting in a mass reduction of approximately 25% (Ecodeco, 2001a). The bio-7\ndrying process provides a dried waste material, which allows for the separation of low8\ndensity material (e.g. shredded paper, fabric etc) from the heavier glass and inert9\nfractions. From the extraction hopper (Ecodeco, 2001b) fractions of metals (ferrous and10\nnon-ferrous), inert materials (glass, stones, brick etc), fines, and SRF are separated. The11\nSRF fraction consists of combustible material, such as paper, card, wood and fabric. The12\nSRF can therefore be used in incinerators as a fuel. The fines fraction is removed from13\nthe waste material (typically <20 mm after primary shredding) by passing over a <6 mm14\nscreen.15\nThe samples used in this study were the MSW input, solid recovered fuel (SRF)16\nand fines output materials. The SRF and organic fines are output materials which are17\nexpected to represent the organic fractions of the waste material post-biodrying. The18\nfines were expected to be organic materials derived from food waste. The samples were19\ncollected at least fortnightly, in 10 x 2 kg batches, which were then thoroughly mixed to20\nmake up the composite sample of the waste material, and \u2018coned and quartered\u2019 to obtain21\na representative 2-3 kg analytical sample from the total batch (Environment Agency,22\n2005; Turrell et al., 2009).23\n7The samples were sorted to remove glass, metals, plastics and inert materials with1\nthe biodegradable material being retained and tested (Environment Agency, 2005). The2\nsamples were dried at 70\u00b0C to 80-90% dry weight and shredded using an adjustable3\ngrinder to <10 mm and <2 mm. The standard particle size of <10 mm (Environment4\nAgency, 2005) was used for the EHT, DR4 and BMc analysis, whilst the smaller <2 mm5\nparticle size was only used in EHT analysis as part of an exploration to assess the effects6\nof particle size on the DOC yield and variation between sample types. The samples were7\nanalysed immediately, or otherwise stored in sealed containers in a cold room (<4\u00b0C)8\nuntil required. Each of the samples was subsampled and tested in triplicate, and the9\nresults expressed are the mean values obtained.10\n11\n2.2. Aerobic DR412\nBiodegradability under aerobic conditions was determined using the DR4 test13\nmethod (Environment Agency, 2005; Godley et al., 2007b; Godley et al., 2005). The test14\nmaterial (100 g dry matter (DM)) was mixed with a seed material (100 g DM), which was15\na mature green waste compost. Water and nutrients (nitrogen, as 2 M ammonium16\nchloride, and phosphorus, as 1 M potassium phosphate) were added to adjust to 50% w\/w17\nmoisture content, based on the measured %DM of the sample. The test mixture was18\nplaced in a reactor vessel at 35\u00b0C for 4 days, with constant aeration (500 ml\/min19\n(Environment Agency, 2005)) through the test material. The O2 consumed during the 420\ndays was estimated from the amount of CO2 released ,which was measured by using 1 M21\nNaOH solutions to \u2018trap\u2019 CO2 and then titrated against 1 M HCl (Turrell et al., 2009).22\nThe volatile solids (VS) content, referred here as loss on ignition (LOI) (European23\n8Committee for Standardisation, 2005) for each sample was determined; and the results1\nexpressed in terms of the LOI content of the test material (mg O\/kg LOI) (Environment2\nAgency, 2005).3\n4\n2.3. Anaerobic BMc5\nThe BM100\/BMc test method (Environment Agency, 2005; Turrell et al., 2009) is6\nbased on a sewage sludge digestion test (Godley et al., 2007b; Godley et al., 2003). The7\ntest material (20 g LOI) was placed in a 350 ml glass container with 50 ml\/l microbial8\nseed (digested sludge) and a nutrient mixture. The mixture was sealed and incubated at9\n35\u00b0C under anaerobic conditions and the release of CO2 and CH4 (biogas) was measured10\nvolumetrically until no further biogas was released (up to 100 days). The results are11\nexpressed as the volume (litres) of biogas generated per kg of LOI of the test material12\n(l\/kg LOI) (Environment Agency, 2005).13\n14\n2.4. Enzyme hydrolysis test15\nThe EHT was applied as described in previous studies (Wagland et al., 2008;16\nWagland et al., 2007). For each sample 25 mg of crude cellulase powder (Sigma,17\nC9422) and 75 mg of hemicellulase powder (Sigma) were dissolved in 20 ml of distilled18\nwater. According to the manufacturer\u2019s specification, each 20 ml of enzyme mixture19\npossessed approximately 175 units of cellulase and 112.5 units of hemicellulase activity.20\nAccording to the manufacturer\u2019s specification, the crude cellulase powder was expected21\nto exhibit some hemicellulase and protease activity, and the hemicellulase enzymes some22\n9cellulase activity. To sterilise the enzyme solution it was then filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm1\nMillipore membrane2\n3\nThe test method consists of three phases as follows:4\ni. The test material (5 g LOI) was placed in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask.5\nPhosphate pH buffer (100 ml 0.37 M) was then added to the flask. A 5 ml6\nsample was removed and filtered (0.45\u00b5m membrane filter) to remove any7\nsolids, and the filtered liquid was then analysed for chemical oxygen demand8\n(COD) (Spectroquant COD test tubes).9\nii. The sample mixture was then autoclaved at 121\u00b0C for 15 min to sterilise the10\nmixture and a further 5 ml sample was removed and filtered for COD analysis.11\niii. The prepared enzyme solution (20 ml) was then added to each of the flasks12\nand the flask sealed with a neoprene bung. The flasks were placed in a13\nshaking incubator at 150 rpm for 20 h at 50\u00b0C. A final 5 ml sample was then14\nremoved for COD analysis.15\n16\nThe amount of moisture in the waste sample and the removal of both the liquid17\nand solids at each stage of sampling, along with the addition of liquid in phase 3, were18\naccounted for in the concentrations of carbon calculated. Soluble COD analysis results19\nwere converted to DOC (mg C\/l) by assuming a COD\/C ratio of 2.67 based on the20\nrelative molecular mass of cellulose monomeric units.21\nTo assess the effect of particle size on DOC yield and variation between replicates22\nthe following was considered-23\n\uf0b7 Post-autoclave DOC [P2];24\n10\n\uf0b7 Total DOC [P3];1\n\uf0b7 Enzyme-only DOC [P3-P2]2\nTo assess the biodegradable content of the samples only the total DOC [P3] was3\nconsidered.4\n5\n3. Results6\n3.1. Biodegradability of the Sample Fractions7\nThe average biodegradability values obtained for the individual waste fractions8\nfor each of the biodegradability test methods are shown in Table 1 and Figure 2. The9\nnumber of samples (n) for the MSW input, SRF and fines was 8, 11 and 6 respectively.10\n11\nTable 1. Average values of DR4 and BMc for each sample type.12\n13\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Figure 2<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<14\n15\nThe values obtained from the BMc, DR4 and EHT test methods indicated that the16\nfines fraction contained the most biodegradable material. The DR4 and EHT test17\nmethods suggest that the fines material was significantly more biodegradable than the18\nMSW input and SRF output (P<0.05, two-tailed t-test). For the BMc method the19\ndifference between the fines material and the MSW were significant (P<0.05, two-tailed20\nDR4 Standard BMc Standard EHT Standard\nmg\/kg LOI Error l\/kg LOI Error Mg C\/kgLOI Error\nMSW <10 mm 165,750 6,624 287 11.4 75,151 2,516\nSRF <10 mm 153,273 6,245 270 15.8 76,228 3,368\nFines <10 mm 278,833 23,555 354 31.0 157,300 8,244\n11\nt-test) but not for the difference in biodegradability between the fines and the SRF. The1\nMSW input and SRF samples were in each case very similar in biodegradable content.2\nFor each of the methods, the difference in biodegradability between MSW and SRF was3\nnot statistically significant (P>0.1, two-tailed t-test).4\n3.2. Effect of Particle Size in the EHT5\n6\nThe particle size of the waste samples had an effect on the DOC released at each7\nphase of the EHT. This is shown in Figure 2.8\nAs expected, the DOC released over the course of the EHT method increased after9\neach phase of the process. In terms of the total DOC (final phase 3 value) the fines10\nmaterial was the most biodegradable (P<0.05, two-tailed t-test), whereas the MSW input11\nand SRF output samples were not significantly different (P>0.1, two-tailed t-test).12\nThe coefficient of variation (Cv) for each set of results was calculated from the13\nfollowing equation-14\n\uf06d\n\uf073\n\uf03dvC Equation 115\nWhere Cv is the coefficient of variation, \u03c3 is the standard deviation and \u00b5 is the16\nmean. Cv is useful since this is a normalised statistic allowing comparison between the17\nthree methods used. The Cv for each sample at each phase of the EHT is shown in Table18\n2.19\n20\n21\n22\n12\nTable 2. Coefficient of variation at each phase of the EHT for MSW, SRF and organic1\nfines samples.2\n3\nThe Cv was consistently higher for the <2 mm samples of MSW and organic4\nfines, whereas the Cv was lower for samples <2 mm for the SRF materials.5\n4. Discussion6\n4.1. Biodegradability of the Sample Fractions7\n8\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of the EHT to monitor a9\nwaste treatment process over a prolonged period of time by comparison with standardised10\nbiodegradability tests. Each of the three methods produced comparable results which11\nindicated that the MSW input and SRF output samples were similar in terms of their12\nbiodegradability whereas the fines fraction was consistently more biodegradable. The13\nextent of variation between samples was comparable in each of the tests (Table 3)14\nindicating that the tests produce consistent measures of biodegradability over an extended15\nsampling period and suggesting that the waste fractions tested were also consistent over16\nthe monitoring period.17\n18\nP2 (Post-autoclave) P3 (Total) P3-P2 (Enzyme-only)\nMSW\n(\u226410 mm) 0.17 0.09 0.12\n(\u22642 mm) 0.26 0.21 0.19\nSRF\n(\u226410 mm) 0.25 0.15 0.13\n(\u22642 mm) 0.19 0.08 0.19\nOrganic Fines\n(\u226410 mm) 0.15 0.13 0.26\n(\u22642 mm) 0.23 0.22 0.39\n13\n1\n2\nTable 3.

It was originally expected that the MSW input material would be more7\nbiodegradable than the SRF material. However, it is apparent from these results that the8\nbiodegradable content of the MSW input is not reduced significantly (P>0.1) due to the9\nrelatively short composting period employed in the biodrying process, which is only10\ndesigned to dry the waste material, and not to bio-stabilise it.11\nIn spite of the biodrying process, the fines output sample was found to be more12\nbiodegradable than the MSW input since this material has had the more slowly13\nbiodegradable materials removed (such as cardboard, wood and fabrics), with the readily14\nbiodegradable materials, such as food waste (vegetable peelings, meat residues etc)15\neffectively becoming more concentrated. The DOC released during the EHT, along with16\nthe DR4 values, suggest that the fines material is significantly (P<0.05) more17\nbiodegradable than the MSW input and SRF output materials. The DR4 values for the18\nfines material were 68% and 82% higher than the MSW input and SRF samples19\nrespectively, whilst for the total DOC (P3) of the EHT, the DOC output from the fines20\n14\nmaterial was 109% and 106% higher than that generated from the MSW input and SRF1\nsamples respectively. However the difference in biodegradability between the fines2\nfraction and the other fractions was lower for the BMc compared to the DR4 and EHT3\ntests. The BMc value for the fines material was 31% higher than the SRF output4\n(P<0.05), and 24% higher than the MSW input (P<0.1). This difference in relative5\nbiodegradability between fractions is likely to be because the BM100\/BMc test method6\nmeasures the full extent of biodegradability (Godley et al., 2007a; Godley et al., 2007b;7\nWagland et al., 2008), and so will completely hydrolyse a higher proportion of the more8\nslowly biodegradable carbon (such as cardboard and wood) in the MSW input and SRF9\nsamples than the EHT and DR4 methods.10\n4.2. Effect of Particle Size in the EHT11\n12\nGrinding of the sample to a smaller size was expected to have an effect on the13\nDOC yield and the variation observed between sample replicates. Grinding to <2 mm14\nwas expected to yield higher DOC release due to the increase in surface area: volume15\nratio of each particle.16\nAs shown in Figure 2 the DOC release at each phase proved to be largely17\nunaffected by particle size with the exception of the fines fraction (P2). Reductions in18\nparticle size have been observed to yield higher rates of enzyme hydrolysis of cellulose in19\na previous study by Dasari and Berson (2007). In their study particle sizes of 33 \u00b5m to20\n850 \u00b5m were investigated, and up to 55% more glucose was produced from cellulase21\nhydrolysis of the smallest particles than for the largest particle sizes (Dasari and Eric22\nBerson, 2007). Whilst the particle sizes used in this study were considerably larger than23\n15\nthose used by Dasari and Berson (2007), the same principle would be expected to apply.1\nThis suggests that the enzymes used in the EHT test were able to access biodegradable2\nsubstrate even in the centre of 10 mm particles.3\nThe use of a smaller sample particle size was also expected to generate a more4\nuniform sample, and therefore provide lower variation between sample replicates. A5\ngreater surface area: particle volume ratio allows higher enzyme coverage, and it was6\npostulated that for larger particle sizes the enzymes would be able to access the middle of7\nthe substrate to varying degrees in the relatively short incubation time, and that it was8\nmore likely that all available substrate will be hydrolysed in the given timescale (20 h) for9\nthe smaller particles. This however did not prove to be the case.10\nThe use of samples of a smaller particle size resulted in a higher DOC release at11\neach phase, however in each case (except fines P2) the differences between DOC release12\nbetween <10 mm and <2 mm were not statistically significant (p \u22650.1). The difference13\nbetween DOC release at P2 for the Fines sample at <10 mm and <2 mm was significant14\n(p<0.05), however the difference at P3 was not (p>0.1). This would suggest that the EHT15\nwould not benefit from further sample grinding from <10 mm (currently the DR4 and16\nBMc requirement) to <2 mm. As shown in Table 2, since the coefficient of variation (Cv)17\nfor the samples of smallest particle size (<2 mm) is higher than that of the larger particle18\nsizes (<10 mm), there is no benefit in terms of improved consistency. This means that19\nthe sample preparation currently used for the DR4 and BMc methods (grinding to <1020\nmm) is suitable for the EHT.21\nWhilst not statistically significant, for the MSW and SRF materials a greater22\namount of DOC was released from the sample during autoclaving for the <2 mm samples23\n16\nthan for <10 mm. This supports the findings in previous studies, where it was observed1\nthat the hydrolysis of hemicellulose and, to an extent, cellulose and lignin is catalysed by2\nmild acid under high temperatures (Jacobsen and Wyman, 2000; Nguyen et al., 1998;3\nTorget et al., 1990). The effects of a high energy pre-treatment process (such as4\nautoclave) of waste material was also reported to cause the slowly biodegradable5\nmaterials to be more accessible and easier to decompose (Tojo et al., 2007). However as6\nthe difference resulting from additional grinding was not statistically significant, this7\nextra sample preparation is not necessary for the EHT method.8\nAs shown by Wagland et al (2008) the EHT and DR4 correlate, to varying9\ndegrees, with the BM100\/BMc. However since each test method has limitations and10\nmeasures different parameters, a correlation of r = 1.0 is very unlikely. The BMc test is11\nsensitive to highly biodegradable substrates, in which acidic conditions can inhibit12\nmethanogenesis (Environment Agency, 2005), thus affecting the final results. The DR413\ntest method is responsive to readily biodegradable material, but due to its short duration14\ncan potentially underestimate the presence of slowly biodegradable materials. The DR415\ntherefore only measures the initial rate of biodegradation (Godley et al., 2007a; Godley et16\nal., 2007b). The EHT doesn\u2019t have the biological disadvantages associated with the DR417\nand BMc methods, however may not measure the full extent of biodegradation in the18\ngiven timescale because of the inherent limitations associated with providing a suitably19\ndiverse range of enzymes and conditions to ensure their sustained activity. As discussed20\nby Wagland et al (2008), the DOC released at P2 may contain varying quantities of DOC21\ncomprising biodegradable and non-biodegradable fractions, likewise P3 may contain22\nDOC of both biodegradable and non-biodegradable natures, and therefore further23\n17\ninvestigation is required to sufficiently determine only the biodegradable DOC. All1\ncurrently available test methods have their limitations. However, this extended2\ncomparison with accepted methods suggests that the EHT is able to produce comparable3\nand consistent results and therefore shows promise as an operational monitoring tool.4\nFurther development of the test is needed, for instance the use of a more complex enzyme5\nmixture to ensure that the biodegradability of a wide range of materials including fats and6\nproteins is measured.7\n8\n4. Conclusions9\n\uf0b7 Each of the biodegradability methods used in this study generated consistent values of10\nrelative biodegradability for the three sample types tested.11\n\uf0b7 The fines material was found to be significantly more biodegradable than the MSW12\ninput and SRF output materials in all three test methods. It was found that the BMc13\ntest indicated a smaller difference in MSW and SRF biodegradability relative to the14\nfines samples. This was attributed to the likelihood that the BMc was more likely to15\nhave hydrolysed a higher proportion of the more slowly biodegradable compounds16\npresent in the MSW input and SRF samples17\n\uf0b7 The use of particles of <2 mm in the EHT test did not release appreciably higher18\namounts of DOC from the waste samples tested. The variation between sample19\nreplicates for the EHT was significantly higher where sample sizes of <2 mm were20\nanalysed compared to sizes of <10 mm. Therefore it is not necessary to grind the21\nsamples from the <10 mm used in the BMc and DR4 methods to <2 mm.22\n23\n18\nAcknowledgements1\nThe authors wish to thank the East London Waste Authority (ELWA) for funding2\nthis study.
