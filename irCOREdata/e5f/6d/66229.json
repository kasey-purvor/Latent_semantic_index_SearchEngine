A heuristic \ndevice involving levels of individual agency, mode of institutionalisation and \nenvironment is used to discuss why some businesses protect practices, develop virtues \nand encourage the exercise of moral agency in their decision-making, whilst others \nstruggle or fail to do so. \n \nIn relation to conventional shareholder-owned capitalist business, both the mode of \ninstitutionalisation and the environment are shown to be largely antithetical to the \ndevelopment of practices. Other businesses may meet the necessary internal \nconditions for the sustenance of practice-like features but remain dependent upon \nfeatures within their environments. To illustrate this we use participant observation to \nshow how one particular organisation \u2013 Traidcraft plc \u2013 meets the relevant conditions. \n \nIntroduction \n \nPatrons are reminded that they are required to keep as \nquiet as possible when artists are performing. If you are \ndisturbed by noise from other patrons we would be grateful \nif you would inform any one of our staff.  Thank you. \n \n(Notice placed on every table inside Ronnie Scott\u2019s Jazz \nClub, Frith Street, London and noted by one of the authors \nin the summer of 2004.) \n \nWhy do some businesses actively protect the virtues of the practices they house whilst \nothers do not? \n \nIn order to explore the concept and existence (or otherwise) of organisational virtue \nthere is a need for some kind of integrating framework, a heuristic device which \nencourages fruitful discussion. Without this, discussion is likely to degenerate into a \nrather general plea for individuals to cultivate the virtues in organisational life. \n \nOur first contention is that MacIntyre\u2019s virtues-goods-practice-institution schema \nprovides just such a conceptual framework, but our second is that the dynamics of the \ninter-relations between the elements of this schema requires more systematic \nconsideration than is evident in the extant literature. This paper attempts this by \napplying familiar levels concepts from systems theory \u2013 the agent, the institution and \nthe environment \u2013 to MacIntyre\u2019s schema and to a business organisation with which \none of us has had a continuing association (Traidcraft plc). \n \nThe paper begins by outlining MacIntyre\u2019s conceptual framework of virtues, goods, \npractices and institutions, characterises the virtuous business organisation, and \ndescribes the levels notions of the agent, institution and environment. It draws some \ntentative conclusions as to relationships between the features of the levels and the \nlikelihood of institutional protection of virtue-embodying practices and concludes by \nconsidering and drawing out implications from the case of Traidcraft plc. \n \nBefore commencing, however, there are two points which we should note. The first is \nthat MacIntyre\u2019s concerns are with bureaucratic organisations in general \u201cwhether in \nthe form of private corporations or of government agencies\u201d (MacIntyre 1985: 25), \nand his characterisation of bureaucratic managers is similarly generic rather than \nspecific to corporations. Our focus in this paper, however, is specifically with \nbusiness organisations and as such, while many of the issues that MacIntyre\u2019s \nframework addresses might equally be applicable to bureaucratic organisations in \ngeneral, we do not directly address this issue. \n \nThe second point is that MacIntyre\u2019s understanding of capitalist organisations draws \nheavily on what has been termed \u201cmanagerial capitalism\u201d, although elements of \n\u201cinvestor capitalism\u201d (see Nielsen 2002) or \u201cstock market capitalism\u201d (Handy 2002) \nare also readily observable in his work. MacIntyre himself accepts that different \ncapitalisms exist, and in the 1995 preface to the republication of his 1953 Marxism \nand Christianity he argues that the social democratic form (which we may take as \nbeing close to the \u201cstakeholder\u201d form \u2013 see Hutton (1995) but also Hampden-Turner \n& Trompenaars (1993)), is inevitably vulnerable to the incorporation and destruction \nof trade unions and a consequent return to a form in which \u201c[w]orkers would so far as \npossible be returned to the condition of mere instruments of capital formation\u201d \n(MacIntyre 1995: xv). The extent, then, to which different forms of capitalism are \nmore or less conducive to organisational virtue is an important question, but one \nwhich we can address only indirectly here. We will, however, return to both these \npoints briefly in our conclusions. \n \nMacIntyre\u2019s virtues-goods-practice-institution schema \n \nGoods, practices and institutions \n \nThe significance of MacIntyre\u2019s work in general and its application to contemporary \norganisations has been addressed in the first paper of this Special Issue. From this it is \nclear that MacIntyre\u2019s arguments for and developments of virtue ethics, and their \napplication specifically to the area of business, are already well documented and have \nreceived critical review (see Beadle 2002; Moore 2002, 2005a, 2005b, for example). \nIn order to explore this further here, however, we begin by returning to MacIntyre\u2019s \noft-quoted definition of a practice: \n \n\u201cAny coherent and complex form of socially established cooperative human \nactivity through which goods internal to that form of activity are realized in \nthe course of trying to achieve those standards of excellence which are \nappropriate to, and partially definitive of, that form of activity, with the result \n 2\nthat human powers to achieve excellence, and human conceptions of the ends \nand goods involved, are systematically extended.\u201d (MacIntyre 1985: 187) \n \nInternal goods derived from practices, both the excellence of products and the \nperfection of the individual in the process (MacIntyre 1985: 189-190 and see also \nMacIntyre 1994: 284 and further below), can be contrasted with external goods such \nas fame, power, profit or, more generally, success. When achieved, MacIntyre argues, \nthese external goods are \u201calways some individual's property and possession. [They \nare] characteristically objects of competition in which there must be losers as well as \nwinners\u201d (MacIntyre 1985: 190). With internal goods, however, although there is \ncompetition in one sense, this is competition to excel and so benefits all members of \nthe community engaged in the practice (MacIntyre 1985: 190-191). \n \nIn order for practices to flourish, however, institutions are required to provide for their \nsustenance:  \n \n\u201cInstitutions are characteristically and necessarily concerned with ... external \ngoods. They are involved in acquiring money and other material goods; they \nare structured in terms of power and status, and they distribute money, power \nand status as rewards. Nor could they do otherwise if they are to sustain not \nonly themselves, but also the practices of which they are the bearers. For no \npractices can survive for any length of time unsustained by institutions. Indeed \nso intimate is the relationship of practices to institutions \u2013 and consequently of \nthe goods external to the goods internal to the practices in question \u2013 that \ninstitutions and practices characteristically form a single causal order in which \nthe ideals and the creativity of the practice are always vulnerable to the \nacquisitiveness of the institution, in which the cooperative care for common \ngoods of the practice is always vulnerable to the competitiveness of the \ninstitution. In this context the essential feature of the virtues is clear. Without \nthem, without justice, courage and truthfulness, practices could not resist the \ncorrupting power of institutions.\u201d (MacIntyre 1985: 194) \n \nMacIntyre\u2019s description of institutions and their relationship with practices can be \napplied in almost any context. MacIntyre himself indicates that, \u201cthe range of \npractices is wide: arts, sciences, games, politics in the Aristotelian sense, the making \nand sustaining of family life, all fall under the concept\u201d (MacIntyre 1985: 188). Our \nargument here is that this can be extended to include organisational life in general and \nbusiness organisations in particular. But the essential association and tension between \npractices and institutions, and between internal and external goods, gives the texture \nof organisational life a central dilemma. We depict this as follows and explore this \ndilemma further below: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3\nPRACTICE \n \nConcerned with the \nexercise of virtue \nand the \nachievement of \ninternal goods \nINSTITUTION \n \nConcerned with the achievement \nof external goods \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMacIntyre acknowledged that in After Virtue he did not pay particular attention to \nwhat he termed \u201cproductive practices\u201d. He later made good that lack of attention by \nreferring specifically to productive crafts such as \u201cfarming and fishing, architecture \nand construction \u2026\u201d: \n \n\u201cThe aim internal to such productive crafts, when they are in good order, is \nnever only to catch fish, or to produce beef or milk, or to build houses. It is to \ndo so in a manner consonant with the excellences of the craft, so that there is \nnot only a good product, but the craftsperson is perfected through and in her or \nhis activity.\u201d (MacIntyre 1994: 284) \n \nBut what is it that enables the craftsperson to seek and realize such perfection? To \nanswer this question requires commentary on MacIntyre\u2019s notion of virtue and its \nrelationship to goods, practices and institutions. \n \nVirtues and institutional governance \n \nMacIntyre initially defines the virtues as: \n \n\u201cdispositions not only to act in particular ways but also to feel in particular \nways. To act virtuously \u2026 is to act from inclination formed by the cultivation \nof the virtues.\u201d (MacIntyre 1985: 149) \n \nBut he later links virtues, goods and practices more specifically: \n \n \u201cA virtue is an acquired human quality the possession and exercise of which \ntends to enable us to achieve those goods which are internal to practices and \nthe lack of which effectively prevents us from achieving any such goods.\u201d \n(MacIntyre 1985: 191) \n \nVirtues, therefore, are enduring character traits (as, of course, are vices), not practice-\nspecific, but spanning and necessary to the flourishing of any practice. The virtues, \nhowever, receive their full warrant in the context of the notion of a narrative quest \ntowards one\u2019s telos \u2013 the good as such: \u201c[t]he virtues are precisely those qualities the \npossession of which will enable an individual to achieve eudaimonia and the lack of \nwhich will frustrate his movement toward that telos\u201d (MacIntyre 1985: 148). (The \ntelos, or purpose or good, of human life is given the name eudaimonia by Aristotle. \nMacIntyre translates this as something like, \u201cblessedness, happiness, prosperity. It is \nthe state of being well and doing well, of a man\u2019s being well-favoured himself and in \nrelation to the divine\u201d (MacIntyre 1985: 148).) \n \nThe virtues enable the individual to achieve the goods internal to practices, and the \nachievement of those goods across a variety of practices and over time is \ninstrumental in the individual\u2019s search for and movement towards their own telos.  \n 4\nCharacteristically, the importance of the virtues for agents is first realised through \nearly participation in and witness of practices. Such experience demonstrates the \ninherence of such attributes as courage, justice, fortitude and temperance to the \nsuccessful achievement of goods internal to practices. Contingence, rather than \ninherence, however, marks their relations to the acquisition of external goods. \n \nTo return briefly to the quotation with which we began, when the institutional \nmanagers of Ronnie Scott\u2019s decided to place notices on every table in the club we may \nreasonably infer that they sought, (perhaps among other things) to protect the \nmusicians\u2019 practice (and hence the exercise of their virtues) from some customers\u2019 \nbehaviour. \n \nBut this leads us to another important point in MacIntyre\u2019s framework: \n \n\u201cthe making and sustaining of forms of human community \u2013 and therefore of \ninstitutions \u2013 itself has all the characteristics of a practice, and moreover of a \npractice which stands in a peculiarly close relationship to the exercise of the \nvirtues \u2026\u201d (MacIntyre 1985: 194, emphasis added). \n \nIn other words, senior managers \u2013 those who have, in one sense, outgrown the \npractice and now represent the institution that houses it \u2013 also have the same \nopportunity to exercise the virtues in the making and sustaining of the institution \n(enabling them on their own narrative quest towards their own telos). This more \ncomplex schema may be represented by the diagram below where the smaller circle \nwith the \u201cP\u201d inside represents the practice of making and sustaining the institution. (It \nis quite likely that many institutions will house more than one practice. For simplicity, \nhowever, we assume a single practice within any particular institution.) \n \n \n \nPRACTICE \n \nConcerned with the \nexercise of virtue \nand the \nachievement of \ninternal goods \n P INSTITUTION \n \nConcerned with the achievement \nof external goods \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMacIntyre, in drawing attention to the central dilemma of his schema, notes that, \n\u201cpractices are often distorted by their modes of institutionalisation, when irrelevant \nconsiderations relating to money, power and status are allowed to invade the practice\u201d \n 5\n(MacIntyre 1994: 289). Thus, an important part of the whole virtues-goods-practice-\ninstitution schema is to focus on the level of the institution in order to assess what \nfeatures of the institution will better enable it not to distort the practice that it houses. \nAnd equally, there is a need to focus on the virtues necessary to sustain what we \nmight call such virtuous institutional forms. Following from this, we can ask what \nwould characterize an institution in good order, one that protects and perhaps extends \nthe excellences of the practice it houses. \n \nThe character of the virtuous institution \n \nEvidence from a variety of studies (Akaah and Riordan 1989; Baumhart 1961; \nBrenner and Molander 1977, for example) highlights the importance of peer and \nsuperior influence on the ethical behaviour of managers. It has been argued (Klein \n1988 and Moore 2005b) that an appropriate way of conceptualising this is to think not \njust in terms of particular individuals and their exercise (or not) of the virtues at the \ninstitutional level, as MacIntyre does, but also in terms of institutional level virtues \n(and vices), and hence of institutional character. Just as MacIntyre talks of the \nconcern for external goods and the acquisitiveness and competitiveness of the \ninstitution, it seems perfectly possible, by way of analogy or projection (Goodpaster \n& Matthews 1982: 135), or by way of metaphor (Morgan 1997: 4-8 and passim), to \nspeak of the institution as having a virtuous or vicious character, or a character that is \nsomewhere between these two extremes. Klein comments that, \u201cformal organizations \ncan function like a moral person \u2026 they potentially have something analogous to \ncharacter, which can be evaluated as virtuous or vicious\u201d (Klein 1988: 56). \n \nA virtuous institutional character, then, might be defined as the seat of the virtues \nnecessary for an institution to engage in practices with excellence, focusing on those \ninternal goods thereby obtainable, while warding off threats from its own inordinate \npursuit of external goods and from the corrupting power of other institutions in its \nenvironment with which it engages (see Moore 2005b). \n \nTaking business organisations as a particular form of institution (one housing what \nMacIntyre, as we have seen, calls \u201cproductive crafts\u201d) and drawing from the \ndefinition of virtuous institutional character given above, the concept of the virtuous \nbusiness organisation can be explored. A business organisation with a virtuous \ncharacter would firstly be aware that it is founded on and has as its most important \nfunction the sustenance of the particular business practice that it houses. Second, and \nfollowing from this, the organisation would encourage the pursuit of excellence in \nthat practice. Third, it would focus on external goods (such as profit and reputation) as \nboth a necessary and worthwhile function of the organisation (they are goods, not \nbads), but only to the extent necessary to the sustenance and development of the \npractice. Finally, the organisation would be such as to be able to resist the corrupting \npower of institutions in its environment with which it in turn relates, such as \ncompetitors, suppliers or those which represent the financial market, where these \nencourage a single-minded concentration on external goods. \n \nWhich particular virtues would characterize virtuous business organisations? \nAlthough we might consider a wider list (Moore (2005b) includes the cardinal virtues, \nfor example), it is clear that justice, courage and truthfulness (MacIntyre 1985: 194, \ncited above) are the sine qua non of MacIntyre\u2019s schema, together with the virtues of \n 6\nintegrity and constancy (MacIntyre 1999: 317-318) which refer to their consistent \napplication across practices and over time. \n \nThe virtuous business organisation would require courage in order to resist the \ncorrupting power of institutions with which it relates and to minimize the effects of \nthe environment on its character where these might be damaging. It would require \njustice in order to distribute external goods appropriately, to weigh its own advantage \nwith that of the wider community, to foster its own excellence through (for example) \nan allocation of roles that ensures that those who are truly best at particular tasks are \nappointed to do them, and to generate internal harmony through ensuring that \nsubordinates accept the justice of their place (Klein 1988: 60). Solomon\u2019s (1992) \nemphasis on trust (by which we should infer the virtue of both offering trust to others \nand being trustworthy oneself) contains within its definition the necessity of \ntruthfulness for the conduct of business. \n \nSuch virtues would find their institutional embodiment in a number of features \n(Moore 2005b). These are the requirement of a just purpose for the particular \npractice-institution combination, the development of a power-balanced structure that \nwill ensure that the views and desires of particular constituencies are not privileged \nover those of others, and decision-making systems and processes that enable rational \ncritical dialogue having the effect of countering biases and enabling the questioning of \nthe hitherto unquestioned. In particular, these will allow the organisation not to see \nitself as compartmentalised (MacIntyre 1999: 322) from other institutions in society \nbut as one part of a larger whole. While to some extent outside of its control, the \nencouragement of a supportive culture will also be a feature of the character of a \nvirtuous business organization (see Moore 2005b for more on the distinction and \nrelationship between culture and character). \n \nBut, to what extent, and under which kinds of circumstance, would such business \norganisations be possible, or even flourish? \n \nPreconditions for virtuous business organisations \n \nAccording to MacIntyre: \n \n \u201cthe ability of a practice to retain its integrity will depend on the way in which \nthe virtues can be and are exercised in sustaining the institutional forms which \nare the social bearers of the practice. The integrity of a practice causally \nrequires the exercise of the virtues by at least some of the individuals who \nembody it in their activities; and conversely the corruption of institutions is \nalways in part at least an effect of the vices.\u201d (MacIntyre 1985: 195) \n \nMacIntyre illustrates the contrast between virtuous and vicious business organisations, \nby describing two fishing crews. One is motivated only or overridingly by the pursuit \nof external goods and hence aims at wages for the crew and profit for the owners. The \nsecond pursues internal goods and is devoted to the particular excellences required by \nthe practice of fishing (MacIntyre 1994: 285-286). In the first case, both owners and \nworkers would abandon the activity should they find other means of enhancing their \nincome. The second crew, however, would subordinate economic goods to an \nallegiance to the continuation of the practice of fishing and the way of life that entails. \n 7\nIt is, in other words, the prioritisation of external goods that corrupts the institution \nand threatens the practice. \n \nIf this is so, the question then becomes what can be done to maintain an appropriate \nbalance between the pursuit of internal and external goods in such a way that the \ninstitution is able to preserve its practices by ensuring that they are not eroded by the \ninordinate pursuit of external goods. \n \nThis, however, raises a further issue. To return to MacIntyre\u2019s fishing crews, because \nboth crews fish it is clear that in the very short-term the conduct of the practice \nrequires neither the virtues of the practitioners and owners, nor the flourishing of the \ninstitutions which house the practice \u2013 technical expertise and equipment is all that is \nrequired. However, in the medium- to long-term at least one commentator (Dobson \n1997) suggests that without an appropriate regulatory environment the virtuous \nfishing crew instanced here would not long survive the effects of the other sort \u2013 \ncrews that would over-fish and then leave in grim parody of the tragedy of the \ncommons.  \n \nThis, then, takes us back to our initial question, which returns in modified form: Why \ndo some businesses actively protect the virtues even where this is to the detriment of \nthe pursuit of external goods such as profit? And it turns out that the description of \nMacIntyre\u2019s work given above attests to a familiar triad \u2013 those of the agent, the \norganisation (institution) and the environment. Any adequate characterisation of either \nvirtuous or vicious business organisations will require us to comment on all three of \nthese. \n \nVirtuous agents \n \nThe first precondition for a virtuous business organisation, then, is the presence of \nvirtuous agents at the level of both the practice and the institution, for without agents \nwho possess and exercise the virtues the practice itself would no longer be fostered \ninternally through the pursuit of excellence, and at the institutional level the \ncorruption of the institution and the consequent distortion of the practice would seem \nto be inevitable. This is particularly the case for those agents who hold decision-\nmaking authority in the institution. But the presence of such agents at both practice \nand institutional (managerial) level is clearly insufficient to guarantee the presence of \norganisational virtue. \n \nA conducive mode of institutionalisation \n \nThe second precondition for a virtuous business organisation is the mode of \ninstitutionalisation (MacIntyre 1994: 289, cited above) which distributes both \ndecision-making authority and decision criteria within institutions: \n \n\u201cThe distribution of power that characterizes a particular institution or \norganization will determine whether the roles and relationship in question \nare or are not instruments of domination or oppression.\u201d (MacIntyre, \npersonal correspondence, 27 June 2000) \n \n 8\nIn other words, we would expect that different institutional forms will support to \ndifferent extents the practices which they house, and thereby enable the exercise of \nthe virtues and the attainment of internal goods to a greater or lesser degree. \n \nIt is this point in particular which has led to much discussion about the possibility or \notherwise of applying MacIntyre\u2019s virtues-goods-practice-institution schema to \ncapitalist business organisations, and this warrants particular discussion at this point. \nMacIntyre\u2019s contention is that in the capitalist forms of business organisation that \nhave emerged the institution has, in effect, \u2018won\u2019 over the practice \u2013 its justification is \nthe pursuit of external goods \u2013 such that \u201cmuch modern industrial productive and \nservice work is organised so as to exclude the features distinctive of a practice\u201d, and \nin such a way that this type of activity is \u201cat once alien and antagonistic to practices\u201d \n(MacIntyre 1994: 286). \n \nThree related points contribute to this view. First, Public Limited Companies (PLCs) \noperate under a variety of legal obligations but their purpose has (at least within \nAnglo-American capitalism) been clear since the judgment in the 1919 Dodge vs. \nFord Motor Co. case compelled Henry Ford to issue a dividend rather than cut \nproduct prices on the basis that \u201ca business corporation is organized and carried on \nprimarily for the profit of stockholders\u201d (cited in Dodd 1932). \n \nA range of examples testify to the dominance of the generation of external goods in \nconventional PLCs\u2019 decision-making. Anita Roddick, who founded The Body Shop \nostensibly around just purposes, has described her decision to go public as a \u201cpact \nwith the devil\u201d which has necessitated the abandonment of much campaigning \nactivity as well as an emphasis on the \u2018bottom line\u2019 that would once have competed \nwith other objectives as decision criteria (Bakan 2004: 51-53).  \n \nWe find similar examples of other companies that do not start from \u2018the bottom line\u2019, \nin Waterman\u2019s work. Applied Energy Systems (AES) is described in these terms: \n \n\u201cThe founders wanted a company that valued people and acted responsibly, \nthat was fair and honest in its approach not only to customers, suppliers, and \nemployees, but to the greater society in which we live. If they happened to \nmake good profits, so much the better. But that wasn\u2019t their goal \u2013 they cared \nmore about the kind of company they could build than its bottom line.\u201d \n(Waterman 1994: 111) \n \nAES went public in 1991, but Waterman records that, \u201c[i]t didn\u2019t really want to; the \nfear was that pressures from the outside would weaken the company\u2019s focus on \nvalues\u201d (Waterman 1994: 135). Levi Strauss, on the other hand, withdrew from the \nrestraints of the financial markets by taking itself private in the mid-1980s through a \nleveraged buyout (Waterman 1994: 143) \u2013 apparently to avoid some of the pressures, \nincluding pressure on its values, that concerned AES. Borrowing MacIntyre\u2019s terms \nagain, where the capitalist system operates effectively, it represents the victory of the \ngoods of effectiveness over those of excellence. \n \nSecond is the range of intellectual and moral errors in the process of decision-making \nthrough which such a victory is institutionalised. Utilitarianism, which acts as the \ndecision-making method in bureaucratic organisations, disguises value choices in \n 9\npresenting both the ranking of harms and benefits and the impacts of decisions over \ntime as simple facts, subordinates means to ends and routinely excludes externalities \nfrom the list of consequences to be weighed. In the ordinary conduct of relations in \nsuch contexts the distinction between manipulative and non-manipulative behaviour is \nthus dissolved (MacIntyre 1964, 1977, 1979, 1985, 1999). \n \nThird is the impact of this on the prospects for moral agency. Here the exclusion of \nboth questions and persons from participation in decision-making (see also Jackall \n1988: 6) becomes a feature, perhaps the feature of the moral life of persons whose \ncharacter is compartmentalised (MacIntyre 1977, 1979 and 1999) and whose moral \nagency, the conditions for which require a narrative unity, are critically undermined \n(MacIntyre 1999 passim). As a result: \n \n\u201cCapitalism \u2026 provides systematic incentives to develop a type of character \nthat has a propensity to injustice.\u201d (MacIntyre 1995: xiv) \n \nThese three points provide a very serious critique of capitalist business organisations \nin the form with which MacIntyre is familiar. Despite this, however, the counter \nargument has been made (Moore 2005b) that all business activities, irrespective of \ntheir form of institutionalisation, must contain the vestiges of a practice and the \nvirtues to some degree, for if they did not \u2013 that is, if the institution had \u2018won\u2019 so \ncompletely that the virtues had suffered \u201csomething near total effacement\u201d (MacIntyre \n1985: 196) \u2013 then the institution would have, in effect, killed itself from the inside by \nfailing to sustain the practice on which it itself is founded. In other words, while in \ncapitalist forms of business organisation the practice may be potentially and \ncontinually under threat from the acquisitiveness and competitiveness of the \ncorporation, it still exists. This counter argument, of course, suggests that MacIntyre \nis overly pessimistic in his assessment. That particular forms of institutionalisation \nmay be more or less conducive to the sustenance and development of the practices \nthey house, however, would seem to be self-evident and we shall explore this further \nbelow. \n \nA conducive environment \n \nHowever, at this stage we need to move on to consider the third precondition for a \nvirtuous business organisation. It is clear that MacIntyre regards institutions as open \nsystems that are both affected by other institutions in society and able (in both \npositive and negative ways) of compartmentalising themselves from them. It is \napparent therefore that a particularly significant factor in any organisation\u2019s ability to \nmaintain and exercise the virtues and support the practice it houses is the extent to \nwhich the environment is more or less conducive to such activity. Character at the \nindividual level, and by extension at the institutional level, is \u201cvulnerable to \nenvironment\u201d, although as Solomon notes, \u201cit is also a bulwark against environment\u201d \n(Solomon 2003: 46). Hence, we would expect that an unconducive environment \nwould be problematic for organisational virtue. \n \nA starting point is to ask whether the environment (regulatory, market, labour and \ncapital) discriminates between organisations in ways related to their exercise of the \nvirtues and protection of practices. Consider, for example, an unusual business \ninstitution that arguably exhibits many of the characteristics of a practice-based \n 10\ncommunity, the travelling circus (Beadle 2003). These include the necessity of \napprenticeship (Carmeli 1991), an emphasis on tradition in the discourse of circus \nartists and in particular in the idea of circus as being everywhere \u201cthe same\u201d (Carmeli \n1997: 8, 2001: 160, 2003: 82) and the primacy accorded to internal goods in the \nsocially accepted understanding of \u201cgoodness\u201d in circus (Stroud 1999; Beadle 2003). \nLike some of the examples of practice-based communities cited by MacIntyre, circus \nis totalising inasmuch as its members\u2019 working, communal and family lives are \nconducted in the same community (Stroud 1999 passim; Davis 2002: 10; Carmeli \n1987: 870)  \n \nThe British circus faces a hostile regulatory and market environment in which the \ngrounds available for its work have been restricted by local authority and other \nlandowners due to concerns about use of animals (Stroud 1999; Carmeli 1997). This \nmay be seen as the environment responding to continuing questioning of the circus\u2019s \njust purpose. As an additional example Carmeli (1987) reports that an environment in \nwhich audiences no longer distinguish between the quality of either individual \ncircuses or individual acts discourages artists and owners from investing in props, \ntricks and improvements in customer service. \n \nUnlike our earlier example from Ronnie Scott\u2019s, many of whose patrons might leave \nshould their enjoyment of the practice be interrupted by noise from other customers, \nthere are limited utilitarian grounds for circus owners to protect and enhance the \ninternal goods being produced. The labour market has, in response, simply moved, \nwith many recognized artists now working in Europe or the USA where the circus is \nmore popular and greater product differentiation is evident (Stroud 1999). \n \nAn ethically responsive environment, which some may claim is evidenced by the \nimpact of the animal rights movement on circus, will encourage institutions to act \nvirtuously. An ethically neutral environment, which some may claim is evidenced by \nthe failure of English audiences to appreciate the distinctive circus virtues of dexterity \nand fortitude that artists exhibit, will provide no utilitarian reasons for institutions to \nact virtuously and a vicious environment, as documented by Davis\u2019s (2002) study of \nthe maltreatment of people of colour and those with disabilities in the American \ncircuses in the 19th and early 20th centuries, will encourage the institution to act \nviciously. \n \nThe mechanism involved here is variation in the distribution of external goods \nthrough the market. Its effectiveness depends on the economic vulnerability of the \ninstitution to such variation and the virtues of those with decision-making authority \nwithin them. Hence, Dobson\u2019s forlorn comment that the virtuous firm, if placed in a \ncompetitive market environment, \u201cwould rapidly perish\u201d (Dobson 1996: 227), is \npredicated on an ethically neutral or vicious environment. MacIntyre himself warns: \n\u201cWe should therefore expect that, if in a particular society the pursuit of external \ngoods were to become dominant, the concept of the virtues might suffer first attrition \nand then perhaps something near total effacement, although simulacra might abound\u201d \n(MacIntyre 1985: 196).   \n \nIn other words, a society in which a vice such as avarice has been, in effect, \nlegitimised, would provide such an unhealthy environment that even the presence of \nvirtuous agents together with a supportive mode of institutionalisation, might not be \n 11\nsufficient to ensure the existence of organisational virtue. It is MacIntyre\u2019s contention \nthat such legitimising of avarice has become ubiquitous in modern capitalist society \n(MacIntyre 1995: xiii). And while, again, MacIntyre\u2019s assessment may be viewed as \noverly pessimistic, it points to the importance of a conducive environment within \nwhich organisational virtue may flourish. \n \nOne further point that merits consideration here relates to the work of institutional \ntheorists. DiMaggio and Powell\u2019s seminal article questioned the \u201cstartling \nhomogeneity of organizational forms and practices\u201d (1983: 148) and defined \ninstitutional isomorphism as \u201ca constraining process that forces one unit in a \npopulation to resemble other units that face the same set of environmental conditions\u201d \n(DiMaggio and Powell 1983: 149). \n \nHowever, as Nelson & Gopalan have observed, while organisations are subject to \nisomorphic pressures, \u201cthey also maintain boundaries, which distinguish them from \ntheir environment and provide a separate identity\u201d \u2013 indeed, \u201c[w]ithout such boundary \nmaintenance, the organization will dissolve\u201d (2003: 1119). They also note the \nexistence (in the sociology of religion and social movements rather than in \norganisation studies) of \u201creciprocal opposition\u201d where organisational values and \ninstitutional forms are developed \u201cwhose features form an inverse image of each other \n\u2026 [t]he oppositional group adopts symbols and social structures that are the \nreciprocal opposite of those used by the dominant group\u201d (Nelson & Gopalan 2003: \n1120). This suggests that, while a conducive environment is clearly beneficial to \norganisational virtue, it may be possible for organisations to resist their environment, \nor potentially to create around themselves a more conducive environment than most \norganisations experience. We will return to this point below. \n \nConclusion \n \nHaving now constructed the conceptual framework within which the concept of \norganisational virtue can be explored \u2013 a heuristic device involving three levels \u2013 the \nquestions that remain are essentially empirical. What kind of inter-relationships exist \nbetween the three preconditions for institutional virtue; to what extent is the strength \nof presence of one or another precondition able to off-set deficiencies in other factors; \nwhat kinds of modes of institutionalisation are more or less conducive to \norganisational virtue; how precarious is organisational virtue; and are there particular \nmechanisms that might be supportive of organisational virtue thus allowing it to \nbecome embedded?  \n \nSuch questions suggest a significant research agenda and in the remainder of this \npaper we can only hint at some empirical observations that make an initial \ncontribution. We do so by describing a virtuous organisation and exploring the \npreconditions for this attribution using our three-level heuristic device. The research \nmethod associated with this is that of participant observation, one of the authors \nhaving had a long association with the organisation and the Fair Trade movement of \nwhich it is a part, and being a member of the Board as a non-executive director. \n \nAssessing the virtuous business organisation: Traidcraft plc \n \n 12\nTraidcraft was founded in 1979 by a group of Christians as a trading business seeking \nto respond to poverty in the developing world through trade. It emerged from a mail \norder and wholesale operation owned by the development charity TEARfund. \nTraidcraft rapidly expanded its product range and developed an extensive network of \nvolunteer sales representatives. It later set up an educational and development charity \n(Traidcraft Exchange) which offers training, consultancy and information services \nrelated to Fair Trade. Christian philosophy remains central to Traidcraft\u2019s work with a \nsignificant majority of Christians in the 5,000 strong national network of volunteers \n(\u201cFair Traders\u201d) selling products in their churches, schools and homes. A similar \nnumber of individual investors, many of whom are Christians, have provided its \u00a35 \nmillion capital base. Traidcraft has very little institutional investment, but is \nnonetheless a Public Limited Company with its shares tradable through an \nindependent stock-broking firm. \n \nTraidcraft plc is committed to working with people of all faiths or none. It sees itself \nas a community of supporters, shareholders, customers, professionals and producers \naiming to reduce poverty by trading with hundreds of small craft producers and \nfarmers in over 30 countries. Its mission, \u201cfighting poverty through trade\u201d, \nencapsulates this. Traidcraft also advocates on behalf of poor producers and \ncampaigns to change unfair conditions of trade and make trade rules work in the \ninterests of the poor. Traidcraft has been a leading organisation in the Fair Trade \nmovement and was a founder member of the International Fair Trade Association \n(IFAT) and the European Fair Trade Association (EFTA) \u2013 see Moore (2004) for a \nfuller description and analysis of the Fair Trade movement. \n \nTraidcraft plc claims to be the leading Fair Trade organisation in the U.K. with sales \nin 2004\/05 over \u00a315.5 million. In line with Fair Trade sales around the world, \nTraidcraft plc\u2019s product mix by category is 71% food and beverages (including tea, \ncoffee and wine as well as combination food products such as snack bars), 12% crafts \nand clothing, and 16% paper products. It sells approximately 47% of its turnover by \nvalue through Fair Trader volunteers, 13% by mail order, 14% through retail and 26% \nvia wholesale of which 11% (of the total) is via supermarkets, although this \nmarginally underestimates this channel due to a recent licensing agreement. In \n2004\/05 its turnover grew by 12% and it achieved a pre-tax surplus of \u00a3530,000 \n(Traidcraft 2005 and internal papers). \n \nTraidcraft is made up of three linked organisations: in addition to the share-based \ntrading company and the Traidcraft Exchange charity, there is the Traidcraft \nFoundation, a charitable Trust which holds a Guardian Share in Traidcraft plc with a \nveto on appointments to the Board and the ability to limit some specific transactions \nincluding the level of shareholder dividend payments. In line with its Christian basis, \nall non-executive and executive directors are required to be practicing Christians. \nAlthough this requirement does not apply to other levels in the organisation, many \nemployees are also Christians and there is an overt emphasis on religious matters \nwithin the firm. Most of the 130 or so permanent staff are located in Gateshead, an \neconomically disadvantaged region within the U.K. Four policy staff are located in \nLondon. The organisation achieved Investors in People status during 2004 at its first \nattempt, with only very minor areas where developments were recommended \u2013 a \nconsiderable achievement. (Investors in People is \u201ca business improvement tool \n 13\ndesigned to advance an organisation\u2019s performance through its people\u201d \n(http:\/\/www.iipuk.co.uk, accessed 4 October 2005). \n \nThe three arms of the Traidcraft organisation are linked by a Deed of Mutual \nCovenant based on core foundational principles. These are that: \n \n\u2022 Traidcraft is a Christian response to poverty \n\u2022 Our mission is fighting poverty through trade \n\u2022 We respect all people and the environment \n\u2022 We abide by and promote fair business practices \n\u2022 We strive to be transparent and accountable  \n(http:\/\/www.traidcraft.co.uk, accessed 4 October 2005) \n \nHow does this description of Traidcraft relate to the preconditions for organisational \nvirtue? First, in terms of the mode of institutionalisation, it is clear that Traidcraft plc, \nas the trading arm of the organisation, has established an institutional architecture that \nquite deliberately limits the focus on external goods. This is not to say that there is no \nfocus on these goods \u2013 Traidcraft plc\u2019s history in which successive losses almost \nbrought the organisation to its knees has led to a more balanced approach and an \nappropriate degree of attention to sales and bottom line figures. But, as a mirror image \nof conventional capitalist business, the \u2018bottom line\u2019 is regarded as a means to an end. \n \nFor example, one of the key figures that the organisation reports on and targets is the \nincreased value of purchases from developing countries, and this reinforces the \nemphasis on the producers that is at the core of the organisation\u2019s purpose rather than \non shareholder value. The limit placed on dividends and the Guardian Share provision \nthat prevents a \u2018carpet-bagging\u2019 takeover, similarly indicate the way in which a limit \non external goods has been, quite literally, institutionalised. \n \nIn terms of the features of a virtuous organisational character, the existence of a just \npurpose and a power-balanced structure are in evidence from the above description. \nIdentifying systems and processes that counter biases and enable the questioning of \nthe hitherto unquestioned, and observing the encouragement of a supportive culture \nare rather harder without some form of ethnographic study, but the recent \nachievement of Investors in People status suggests that these are also well in hand. \nFurthermore, based on one of the author\u2019s first-hand experience, the effective \nfunctioning of the Board in bringing to bear a range of perspectives from outside the \nimmediate concerns of the organisation suggests that a questioning culture exists. \n \nIn relation to the corporate virtues it is clear from the above description that justice is \ncarefully nurtured and exercised. If part of this virtue is the prudent allocation of \nresources then, as noted above, prudence has been exercised over recent years in \nestablishing an appropriate balance between the achievement of internal and external \ngoods. Courage is in evidence in its dealings with mainstream organisations such as \nthe supermarkets where the approach of Fair Trade needs to be defended. Finally, the \nexistence of integrity (exercising the same virtues across different practices) might be \nobserved in the mutually enriching co-existence of a charity and trading company, \nand constancy (the same virtues exercised over time) is evident in the consistent \nemphasis on its core mission of fighting poverty through trade. \n \n 14\nTraidcraft plc\u2019s mode of institutionalisation, therefore, seems to support the \nachievement of a virtuous organisational character. The next precondition for \norganisational virtue which we need to consider, that of a conducive environment, \nfollows immediately from this. For while Traidcraft plc operates in many ways within \nthe normal context for most businesses \u2013 banking arrangements, legal requirements \nfor aspects such as employment practices, pensions, audit and taxation, buying \norganisations and consumers who are looking for value for money \u2013 it is nonetheless \nclear that in several important respects it operates within a more conducive \nenvironment than many other business organisations. By not participating in the \nnormal financial market for shares the company avoids the pressure to maximise \nprofits, and instead has supportive shareholders who have invested on the \nunderstanding that the financial return is likely to be limited \u2013 a first dividend for \nmany years of 2.5p per share (2.5%) was declared in 2004 and repeated in 2005 and \nshares trade at approximately par value. \n \nIn addition to this, although the company deals with mainstream organisations such as \nsupermarkets, where prices may come under pressure and quality standards are \nexacting, many of its customers such as its own Fair Traders network and \u2018World \nShops\u2019 to which it sells, are highly supportive of the organisation and its mission. \nSimilarly, a conducive labour market sees many employees working at Traidcraft not \nbecause of the financial rewards (which tend to be at the lower end of the scale), but \nbecause they also \u2018buy into\u2019 the organisation\u2019s mission. Equally, the relationship with \nproducer organisations in the developing world is regarded as one of partnership \nrather than dependency, and while the producers are generally very clear that \nmaximisation of their incomes through fair prices (often above the local price) and \nincreasing and consistent volumes is a key part of the relationship, they too are \nstrongly supportive of Traidcraft plc and its mission. This suggests that Traidcraft plc \nhas been able to establish what we might refer to as a \u2018micro-climate\u2019 within its \nenvironment in which financial, consumer, labour and supply markets are rather more \n\u2018friendly\u2019 than is commonly the case. \n \nWith reference to the concepts of institutional isomorphism and reciprocal opposition \ndiscussed above, it may well be that in Traidcraft plc\u2019s case, in both its origins and its \nsubsequent development, there has been a quite deliberate fostering of this sense of \nreciprocal opposition and that this has been instrumental both in the institutional form \nthat has been constructed and in the establishment of a micro-climate that is more \nconducive of institutional virtue. \n \nWhat, then, of the presence of virtuous agents within the organisation? Again, without \na detailed ethnographic study this is not particularly easy to assess. The strong \nChristian emphasis, however, means that many of the key individuals in the \norganisation have a strong faith-based set of values and it is undoubtedly true that \nmany see working at Traidcraft as an opportunity to apply these values consistently, \nas much in their working lives as elsewhere. In terms of the virtues-goods-practice-\ninstitution schema this could be redescribed in terms of the consistent exercise of \nvirtues across different practices in the context of a narrative quest towards their own \ntelos. That these kinds of agents exist at both the level of the practice and the \ninstitution is clear, and there is both an appropriate degree of focus on the excellence \nof the practice of being a Fair Trade business, and a healthy level of (usually positive) \ncriticism from those engaged in the practice towards those who represent the \n 15\ninstitution (the management) to suggest that the integrity of the practice, which \n\u201ccausally requires the exercise of the virtues by at least some of the individuals who \nembody it in their activities\u201d (MacIntyre 1985: 195, cited above) in order to ward off \nthe threat from the institution\u2019s inordinate pursuit of external goods, is secure. \n \n \n \nConclusions \n \nWe have suggested that any attempt to explore the concept of organisational virtue in \nbusiness requires an integrating framework, a heuristic device within which fruitful \ndiscussion may be conducted. Our contention has been that MacIntyre\u2019s virtues-\ngoods-practice-institution schema provides such a conceptual framework and that \nwithin this framework the focal point for the exercise of virtue is the practice. Within \nany practice-institution combination, however, there are, in fact, two practices. The \nfirst is the practice at the core of the activity \u2013 farming or fishing, architecture or \nconstruction, or whatever. The second is the practice of making and sustaining the \ninstitution itself. We then identified three preconditions necessary for a virtuous \nbusiness organisation: the presence of virtuous agents at both the practice and \ninstitutional levels; a conducive mode of institutionalisation that, in particular, \nprioritized internal goods (a focus on the practice) while maintaining sufficient \nattention to external goods to ensure an appropriate balance of the two; and, thirdly, a \nconducive environment within which organisational virtue might flourish. \n \nIn our discussion of circus organisations we noted how organisations that might well \nhave agents, at both practice and institutional levels, with an appropriate focus on the \npractice at their core, and might equally well have an appropriate mode of \ninstitutionalisation that would foster the practice, could find themselves unable to \nsustain the virtuous organisation because of the lack of a conducive environment. This \nsuggests that all three preconditions are indeed necessary. \n \nIn our discussion of capitalist business organisations we noted that both an \nunconducive environment (including, in particular, the financial markets), that \nencourages a single-minded focus on external goods, and a mode of \ninstitutionalisation that also tends to be dominated by a focus on external goods rather \nthan the practice and its internal goods, suggests that even the presence of virtuous \nagents at both the level of the practice and the institution would be unlikely to enable \nthe achievement of a virtuous business organisation. Capitalist business organisations, \nas MacIntyre has argued, seem to be largely antithetical to the development of \npractices. Nonetheless, we held out hope even here by observing that the institution \nmust contain the vestiges of a practice and the virtues to some degree, a counter \nargument, of course, that suggests that MacIntyre may be overly pessimistic in his \nassessment. \n \nThe evidence provided in our earlier discussions of Public Limited Companies, which \ncontrasted those which had become public companies with those that had taken \nthemselves private, suggests that it is partially within a corporation\u2019s power to create \nor choose its own environment. \n \n 16\nIn beginning to answer some of the empirical questions that derive from the \nconceptual framework and preconditions for organisational virtue, what is particularly \nevident from our case study of Traidcraft plc is the way in which the three \npreconditions for organisational virtue can be self-reinforcing. Starting with a mode of \ninstitutionalisation that is doubtless conducive to organisational virtue, the \norganisation has managed, perhaps as a result, to create what we termed a micro-\nclimate which provides a largely conducive environment within which organisational \nvirtue might flourish and in \u201creciprocal opposition\u201d to other organisations facing a \nmore hostile environment. This reinforces the point that corporations may, to some \nextent, be able to create or choose their own environment, and that exercising this \ndiscretion is a feature that we might expect to find in the virtuous corporation. \nPerhaps as a result of exercising this discretion with respect to its environment and in \nthe creation of a conducive mode of institutionalisation, Traidcraft plc attracts agents \nat both the level of the practice and the institution who reinforce organisational virtue \n\u2013 although the causal direction cannot be substantiated here. \n \nThis would suggest that, where all three preconditions are present, organisational \nvirtue is unlikely to be precarious. Even a considerable change in one of the factors \u2013 \nfor example, the employment of a Chief Executive who, once in post, sought to drive \nthe organisation towards a much more commercial orientation, with a much stronger \nfocus on the achievement of external goods \u2013 would seem unlikely to have much \nimpact. More likely would be the expulsion of such a person as the other factors came \ninto play to preserve the organisation\u2019s virtue. Equally, the Traidcraft plc case study \ndemonstrates the sense in embedding organisational virtue in such things as \ngovernance structures, rather than relying solely upon individual agents to preserve it. \nAs such it indicates one mechanism for such a process of embedding \u2013 a mechanism \nthat Keeley (2000) has already suggested. \n \nWe indicated at the outset that we would be unable to address in any depth two other \npoints that arise from MacIntyre\u2019s work. In relation to other forms of bureaucratic \norganisation, all we can tentatively suggest here is that the virtues-goods-practice-\ninstitution schema is generic such that its application to other forms of organisation, \nand the preconditions for institutional virtue that we have identified, would be equally \napplicable in, for example, government and non-profit organisations. Similarly, we \nwould expect that MacIntyre\u2019s critique of managers, and the answer that we propose \nin terms of the key role of management as the practice of making and sustaining the \ninstitution, would be generically applicable. The extent to which different forms of \ncapitalism are more or less conducive to organisational virtue is, again, something that \nwe have not been able to address directly. Forms of capitalist societies that are less \ndirected towards the achievement of external goods, and accompanying modes of \ninstitutionalisation, would, on our analysis, be more conducive of institutional virtue, \nbut we have been unable here to present even circumstantial evidence in support of \nthis claim. \n \nIf, however, MacIntyre\u2019s conceptual framework, and its development and application \nto organisational life in general and business organisations in particular, has \nsomething to offer, (as we believe it does), then, as we have both outlined and begun \nto explore above, the questions that remain are largely empirical. We invite others, \nthen, to join us in that empirical quest. \n \n 17\n  18\nReferences \n \nAkaah, I. and E.
