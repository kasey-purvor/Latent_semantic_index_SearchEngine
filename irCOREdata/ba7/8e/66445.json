Since the first report of\nsignificant strength and toughness improvements in poly-\ncrystalline alumina by incorporating a dispersion of\n5% \u201310% submicron silicon carbide particles,1 some but not\nall subsequent studies have shown enhanced fracture strength\nand all have found only small, if any, increases in fracture\ntoughness.2\u20136 The differences in fracture strength between\nthe \u201cnanocomposite\u201d and alumina have been found to de-\npend strongly on the surface finish of the materials.7 Al-\nthough Zhao et al.2 suggested that strengthening might result\nfrom a compressive surface residual stress introduced by the\nmachining, the evidence for this has been limited. Shifts in\nthe Cr3+ fluorescence peak in the alumina component of the\ncomposites and the minimum fracture load in Hertzian in-\ndentation methods have been interpreted in terms of large\nsurface compressive stresses sup to 1500 MPad being present\nin ground nanocomposite surfaces but not in ground alumina\nsurfaces.7\u20139 We report here the use of high resolution grazing\nincidence x-ray powder diffraction to provide direct evidence\nfor the existence of a uniform compressive strain close to the\nsurface of ground alumina\/SiC nanocomposites.\nAlumina and alumina\u2013silicon carbide nanocomposite\nsamples were produced by a method reported in detail\nelsewhere.5\u201310 Alumina powder sSumitomo AKP53d with\nsubmicron particle size and quoted chemical purity of\n99.99%a-Al2O3 was hot pressed at 1500\u00b0C for 1 h under a\npressure of 20 MPa. Commercial a-SiC powder sLonza UF\n45d with a mean particle size of ,200 nm was mixed with\nalumina at a concentration of 5% by volume. The nanocom-\nposite was hot pressed in a graphite die at 1650 to 1680 \u00b0C\nfor 1 h under 20\u201325 MPa in flowing argon, resulting in a\nmaterial with mean grain size of about 3 mm. An epoxy resin\nbonded diamond wheel sgrit size 150 mm, wheel speed\n1250 rpm, table translation speed 0.8 ms\u22121, feed depth\n12.5 mm per passd was used to grind both sides of the hot\npressed disks, leaving a specimen thickness of about 3 mm.\nSelected ground samples were annealed at 1250 \u00b0C for\n120 min under flowing argon. A reference surface of nano-\ncomposite was produced by fine polishing using a Kent III\npolishing machine with Engis Kemet plates. The polishing\nplates rotated at about 60 rpm with an external load of 15 N;\ndiamond grit of 25, 8, 3, and 1 mm size was used sequen-\ntially.\nHigh resolution x-ray powder diffraction enables re-\nsidual elastic strain to be measured in ceramics from the shift\nin the position of the Bragg diffraction peaks. sWe have re-\ncently described how the variation in width of a selected\nBragg peak as a function of the beam incidence angle can be\nused to measure the strain dispersion, related to the disloca-\ntion density, as a function of depth below ground and pol-\nished surfaces of alumina and alumina\/SiC nanocom-\nposite.11d Precise measurement of the peak maximum of a\nnumber of powder diffraction peaks as a function of the\nsgrazingd angle of the incident x-ray beam was undertaken at\nbeamline ID31 at the ESRF, Grenoble. Nine Ge 111 analyzer\ncrystals displaced by 2\u00b0 with respect to one another permit-\nted rapid parallel data collection at very high resolution.12\nFor each incidence angle, the sample remained stationary\nand the diffraction pattern was recorded by scanning the de-\ntectors. The divergence in the scattering plane of the 8 keV\nincident beam, sagitally focused by a 111 Si monochromator,\nwas 8 arc seconds. For this energy, the Ge analyzer reflection\nfull width at half height maximum sFWHMd was 17 arc sec-\nonds giving extremely high angular resolution and strain sen-\nsitivity. From an incidence angle of 0.25\u00b0 to 20\u00b0, the pen-\netration depth varied from 0.3 mm to 25 mm. The Bragg\npeaks were fitted to pseudo-Voigt functions. The Bragg angle\ncorrection associated with refraction at the surface was de-\ntermined by measuring the critical angle for total external\nreflection using a Bede GXR1 reflectometer. As the surfaces\nwere too rough for specular reflectivity measurements, the\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 86, 061909 s2005d\n0003-6951\/2005\/86~6!\/061909\/3\/$22.50 \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics86, 061909-1\nDownloaded 21 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66.

The solid line in\nFig. 1 is the displacement predicted due to refraction of the\nincident wave on entering the material. All data lie scattered\nabout this line, indicating that the Bragg plane spacing does\nnot alter as the wave penetrates to progressively smaller\ndepths into the sample with decreasing incidence angle. The\nabsence of a uniform strain in the surface is in marked con-\ntrast to the dramatic increase in the full width at half height\nmaximum sFWHMd of these Bragg peaks as the incidence\nangle is reduced.11 Annealing has no effect on the Bragg\npeak displacement, but causes a major reduction in the\nFWHM and the rate at which the strain dispersion, and dis-\nlocation density, falls with depth into the material.11\nIn marked contrast to the single phase alumina, the\nBragg peaks of the ground nanocomposite shift to a larger\nBragg angle than predicted by the refractive index correction\nsFig. 2d. All reflections for ground nanocomposite surfaces\nlie well above the line, except for the 30.0 reflection sfor the\ncrystal orientation used, the 30.0 planes will not significantly\nchange their spacing in response to an in-plane surface stress,\nbecause of Poisson\u2019s ratio effects11 d. The increase in Bragg\nangle means that the in-plane lattice parameter is decreased;\nthe lattice is compressed. However, on annealing, the uni-\nform strain disappears and all Bragg peaks are displaced only\nby the value predicted for the refraction correction corre-\nsponding to the experimentally measured refractive index.\nDeconvolution of the measured peak position as a func-\ntion of angle to derive the strain as a function of depth is\ncomplex due to the strong variation of the FWHM with in-\ncidence angle. For higher angles, although the beam probes\nthe scattering deep in the material, scattering from the highly\ndefective near-surface region is convolved into the data. The\nweighting of the contribution from difference depths there-\nfore depends both on the angular shape and position of the\nBragg scatter associated with each elemental slice of mate-\nrial. If we make the very drastic simplification that the Bragg\npeak position is associated with the average depth of penetra-\ntion of the x-ray beam, we can extrapolate the surface com-\npressive strain assuming that the strain falls exponentially\nfrom the surface. Such a model function provides a very\ngood description of the strain dispersion, and hence Bragg\npeak FWHM.14 The scatter on the data is too high to permit\na stringent test of the validity of these assumptions but the fit\nsinset to Fig. 3d is sufficient to extrapolate confidently to a\nstrain induced shift of 0.2\u00b0 in the scattering angle associated\nat the surface. This corresponds to a surface compressive\nstrain of 0.1\u00b10.01%, or compressive stress of 400\u00b140 MPa.\nAlignment of the ground nanocomposite sample such\nthat the grinding direction lies either in or perpendicular to\nthe incidence plane results in different displacements of the\nBragg peaks sFig. 3d. When the grinding direction is perpen-\ndicular to the diffraction vector, the peak shift is greater than\nthe refraction correction; when the grinding direction is in\nthe incidence plane, the peak shift drops back to the value\npredicted for the refraction correction. Thus, for the nano-\ncomposite, the strain is oriented perpendicular to the grind-\ning direction. Figure 1 shows that, in single phase alumina,\nthere is also no evidence of strain when the grinding direc-\ntion is in the x-ray incidence plane. Scanning electron micro-\ngraphs of the ground surfaces of the alumina and nanocom-\nposite show dramatically different topologies sFig. 4d. The\nalumina surface shows little anisotropy but very substantial\nFIG. 1.

The\nx-ray data are consistent with the effect of strain fields of\nsuch cylindrical defects in the nanocomposite.\nPolishing of the nanocomposite removes the uniform\nelastic strain in the surface sFig. 3d; the peak displacements\ncorrespond to those predicted by the refraction correction.\nNo further change is observed on subsequent annealing of\npolished material.\nOur results on alumina\/SiC show that a compressive\nstrain, and hence stress, exists in the ground surface, prima-\nrily oriented normal to the grinding direction, as proposed by\nMarshall et al.15 It disappears on annealing at 1250 \u00b0C. The\nstrain is not evident in the ground surface of single phase\nalumina or polished surfaces of nanocomposite. Such a com-\npressive stress provides a mechanism for enhancing the\nstrength of the nanocomposite, by opposing any tensile load-\ning tending to open surface flaws. Since the largest and thus\nmost effective strength-reducing flaws induced by grinding\nare expected to lie along the grinding direction,16 the\ngrinding-induced stress is oriented for the maximum\nstrengthening effect. We have thus direct evidence for the\nmechanism of Zhao et al.2 and Wu et al.,8 by which\nalumina\u2013silicon carbide nanocomposites can have increased\nstrength compared to alumina despite little or no increase in\ntoughness.\nThe origin of the stresses reported here is probably as-\nsociated with enhanced grain boundary strength of the nano-\ncomposite alumina\u2013silicon carbide compared to alumina,\nproducing transgranular rather than intergranular fracture6\nand suppressing grain pull-out in erosion,17 abrasion, and\npolishing.18 The severe plastic deformation produced in near-\nsurface grains by grinding9 will give rise to high grain\nboundary stresses. In alumina, with relatively weak grain\nboundaries, these stresses readily lead to grain-boundary\nfracture and loss of the most deformed material from the\nsurface. In the nanocomposites, with relatively strong grain\nboundaries, the deformed material is retained, giving rise to\nthe observed high compressive stresses. The micrographs\nshown in Fig. 4 are consistent with this mechanism; however\nthe reasons for enhanced grain boundary strength in the\nnanocomposites are still obscure.\nThanks are expressed to Dr. A. N. Fitch and the staff of\nID31 at the ESRF for excellent technical support and Alex\nPym for assistance with data collection.\n1K. Niihara and A. Nakahira, Ann. Chim.-Sci.
