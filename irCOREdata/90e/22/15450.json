Under-\nstanding a child\u2019s acquisition and transmission of these \ncultural behaviors is clearly an important scientific goal, \nbut capturing such a complex phenomenon is difficult. We \nas humans live within a rich, culturally laden environment \nsurrounded by cultural artifacts and behaviors, so natural-\nistic observation in this environment would appear to offer \nan opportunity to investigate and describe how behaviors \nare transmitted from one individual to another. However, \nalthough naturalistic observation can be extremely infor-\nmative, a causal role for social learning is difficult to es-\ntablish without controlled experimental intervention; the \nresult, until quite recently, was more likely to be a descrip-\ntive account of the phenomenon, rather than a specific \ntesting of hypotheses relating to the mechanisms under-\npinning behavioral change.\nAt the other extreme, numerous experimental studies \nhave investigated specific hypotheses about the ante-\ncedents, consequences, mechanisms, and interrelations \nof different social contexts and cognitive skills in chil-\ndren\u2019s social learning. Such social learning is assumed by \nmany authors to be a critical ability underpinning cultural \ntransmission (Boyd & Richerson, 1985; Plotkin, 2003; \nRicherson & Boyd, 2005; Tomasello, 1999), although \nothers have highlighted the complementary role of trial-\nand-error learning in the transmission and development \nof cultural forms (Sterelny, 2006). We note, however, that \nthe experimental work on social learning in children has \nalmost exclusively used a dyadic design, in which a sin-\ngle child participant watches another individual (usually \nan adult) perform a behavior and then is given the op-\nportunity to interact with the task apparatus, to discover \nwhether he or she then will perform the behavior or vari-\nants of the behavior witnessed. Current areas of interest \nwithin this field include the role of selective social learn-\ning (i.e., whether a child copies means or goals; Carpenter, \nAkhtar, & Tomasello, 1998; Carpenter, Call, & Tomasello, \n2005; Meltzoff, 1995), the role of ostensive pedagogy and \neye gaze in children\u2019s interpretation of a task (Csibra & \nGergely, 2009), the underpinning cause of overimitation \n(Lyons, Young, & Keil, 2007; McGuigan, Whiten, Flynn, \n& Horner, 2007), and how a model\u2019s identity and behav-\nior affect a child\u2019s interpretation of a task (Nielsen, 2006; \nWood, Kendal, & Flynn, 2010).\nAlthough such dyadic studies have been extremely in-\nformative, there are four main cultural issues that they typi-\ncally fail to address. First, it is undeniable that the adults in \n \nStudying children\u2019s social learning  \nexperimentally \u201cin the wild\u201d\nEmma Flynn\nDurham University, Durham, England\nand\nandrEw whitEn\nUniversity of St Andrews, St Andrews, Scotland\nDiffusion studies are taking us a step closer to understanding social learning and cultural transmission in \nyoung children.

Flynn, e.g.flynn@durham.ac.uk\nChildren\u2019s soCial learning \u201cin the Wild\u201d    285\nbeginning of the series (Caldwell & Millen, 2009, 2010), \nspaghetti towers get taller (Caldwell & Millen, 2008), and \nan initially random language becomes more systematic \nand learnable (Kirby, Cornish, & Smith, 2008). To inves-\ntigate the larger phenomenon of culture, where the process \nof transmission is investigated beyond the dyadic setting \nand is extended to groups of individuals, we need a differ-\nent method, one that allows for an investigation of change \nacross cultural generations. Diffusion designs offer such \na method.\nExperimental Studies of Culture\nDiffusion studies were first introduced by Bartlett \n(1932), who was interested in the recall of narratives \n(folktales and newspaper reports) along generations of \nindividuals when each participant was presented with the \nrecall produced by the previous participant. The approach \nhas experienced a renaissance in recent times, such that \nMesoudi and Whiten (2008) were able to review a varied \ncorpus of 34 such studies with human adults. Similarly, \nresearchers in animal social learning, with an interest in \ncultural transmission, have recognized the significance \nof the diffusion experiment and have developed it to test \nand study the spread of traditions in controlled conditions. \nA review by Whiten and Mesoudi (2008) identified 33 \nsuch studies in fish, birds, primates, and other mammals, \nfrom the first in 1972 up to 2008 (see also Reader & Biro, \n2010).\nSince the pioneering work of Bartlett (1932), a number \nof alternative diffusion designs have been used (see Fig-\nure 1 for an illustration). First, diffusion chains follow an \niterative dyadic design in which, after an initial, trained \nmodel begins the chain, the individual who learns from the \ninitial model becomes the model for the next in the chain, \nand so on. The diffusion chain design offers a controlled \nmethod for examining transmission of behavior across \nindividuals within groups, as the experimenter assigns \nparticipants to, and positions them within, the experimen-\ntal chains. The diffusion chain design allows systematic \ncomparisons to be made regarding factors that may affect \ntransmission, such as sex, temperament, intelligence, and \nexpertise. The second, replacement diffusion method is \nsimilar to the diffusion chain design but involves a group \nof individuals who work on a task during the same period, \nwith the longest serving member of each group then being \nreplaced by a new naive member after a certain number \nof task attempts. Such a design may represent a better ap-\nproximation of some real-world contexts, such as staff \nturnover in a business, but it still incorporates a certain \ndegree of experimental control by, again, allocating indi-\nviduals to chains or positions in chains. A third design is \nopen diffusion, where a model trained, or naturally profi-\ncient, in a behavior of interest is introduced, along with \nthe task, to a group of novices. Such a design provides less \nexperimental control, since participants choose when, or \nindeed whether, to attempt the task. The resulting trans-\nmission of behavior is thus potentially much messier than \ndiffusion chains or replacement designs but represents a \nmore realistic and, therefore, ecologically valid context in \nwhich to explore social learning and cultural transmission. \na child\u2019s life are extremely influential in his or her cogni-\ntive and social development (e.g., theory of mind; Lewis, \nFreeman, Kyriadidou, Maridaki-Kassotaki, & Berridge, \n1996), but children may also learn from their peers; in this \nway, information may be transmitted horizontally (within \ngenerations), rather than vertically (between generations). \nExperimental work has shown that the identity of a part-\nner influences an infant\u2019s behavior on a task; for example, \ninfants as young as 3 months show a preference for fe-\nmale over male faces (Quinn et al., 2008). Model identity \nhas specific theoretical import too, as highlighted, among \nother biases, by prestige bias, where observers copy indi-\nviduals held in high, rather than low, esteem (Henrich & \nGil-White, 2001; Laland, 2004).\nSecond, although developmental psychologists are well \ntrained in the practice of putting children at their ease in \nsuch a setting, it is undeniable that an experimental setting, \nwith a single experimenter (a relative stranger, who often \nacts as the model) and a child participant, must, at the very \nleast, be a specialized and even uncommon experience for \na young, nursery-aged child. As such, it is possible that \nchildren may feel under special pressure in this strange \nsituation; they may thus behave in a way that is different \nfrom how they would behave if faced with the same task in \na more familiar environment, such as their home or a nurs-\nery group. Such a dynamic is again of theoretical import, \nsince copy-if-uncertain (Laland, 2004) may be a social-\nlearning strategy used not only if one is uncertain about \nthe task, but also if one is uncertain about the significance \nof the environment in which the task is presented.\nThird, in dyadic studies, children often experience only \none or two trials on a task. Such a constraint does not re-\nflect a naturalistic setting in which children witness multi-\nple demonstrations and have the opportunity for multiple \nattempts at a new task. Giving children the opportunity to \nwitness multiple attempts in a study means that these at-\ntempts can be experimentally manipulated\u2014for example, \nchanging the identity of the demonstrator across trials or \nthe accuracy of the demonstrated attempt. Likewise, al-\nlowing a child multiple attempts following demonstration \nmeans that change over trials can be examined, such as \nimprovement in the efficiency of a method (ratcheting) or \nthe potential for increased fidelity to a demonstration.\nThe fourth and most fundamental issue we wish to high-\nlight is that culture is a much bigger phenomenon than \nthe simple dyadic relations found in many social-learning \nstudies; it is, in reality, a population-level phenomenon \nthat involves the repeated transmission of information \nas it spreads across individuals, both within and between \ngenerations. It is therefore essential that social-learning \nexperiments be extended to mimic the transmission of in-\nformation and behavior within and between groups. Such \nstudies with adults, using diffusion experiments, in which \nbehavior is tracked within groups (a method described in \nfull in the following section), have shown that changes in \nbehavior may be small within a single dyadic transmission \n(adult to adult) but that, over generations of such episodes, \nthe change can be significant. In the laboratory microso-\ncieties created in these experiments, paper airplanes fly \nfarther at the end of a series of generations than at the \n286    Flynn and Whiten\nfor economy, we outline the general method and rationale \nhere. First, all the studies used the extraction of a reward \nfrom some kind of artificial fruit as the behavior of inter-\nest to be transmitted. Initially developed to study social \nlearning of foraging techniques in nonhuman primates \n(Whiten, Custance, Gomez, Teixidor, & Bard, 1996), ar-\ntificial fruits are puzzle boxes that contain a reward that \nis trapped by single or multiple defenses that need to be \nremoved before the reward can be retrieved, as in process-\ning a real, complex fruit (Flynn & Whiten, 2008b; Whiten \net al., 1996). An observer watches a model extract the re-\nward from the artificial fruit and is then presented with a \nrebaited artificial fruit that has all the defenses in place. \nA critical experimental point is that all the artificial fruits \nused in these diffusion studies are designed to permit at \nleast two methods that allow extraction of the reward. For \nexample, in one of the simplest forms, a reward may be \nheld in place by a door and accessed by sliding the door ei-\nther to the left (Method A) or to the right (Method B). The \nexistence of these two methods allows the authors of these \narticles to use a three-group design that includes Meth-\nods A versus B, plus a no-model control group (Whiten, \nHorner, & de Waal, 2005). A distinction can then be drawn \nabout whether observers are copying the means used to \nachieve a goal (the specific method, A or B, used to extract \nthe reward) and thus, in a broad sense, copying what they \nWe can perhaps think of this as studying social learning \nexperimentally with children \u201cin the wild.\u201d\nMesoudi and Whiten (2008) and Whiten and Mesoudi \n(2008) have offered extensive reviews of the use of these \ndiffusion designs with human adults and nonhuman ani-\nmals, respectively. However, notably absent from these \notherwise comprehensive reviews were diffusion studies \nin which the participants were children. The reason was \nsimple: Scarcely any such studies had been published. \nSuch studies have recently begun to proliferate, however, \nand below we review five of these child diffusion experi-\nments. We then describe the results from a new study that \nused an open-diffusion design. The study investigated how \ninformation is spread when individuals in a group have an \nopportunity to acquire some personal information about \nthe task before any social diffusion begins. We present \nthese new data with specific reference to the methodologi-\ncal concerns and constraints that one needs to consider \nand adapt to when carrying out an open-diffusion study \nwith children.\nDiffusion Studies With Young Children\nIn this section, we review five studies in which diffu-\nsion chains were used to address theoretically interesting \nquestions. All the studies have used a common methodol-\nogy, aside from the diffusion chain design itself, and so, \nA\nB\nC\nFigure 1. Diffusion designs. The pattern in each circle represents an individual\u2019s identity in diffusion chains (A), \nreplacement chains (B), and open diffusion (C). In panel C, the larger circles represent individuals working on \na task at one time, and the smaller circles represent those individuals who are observing the \u201cactor\u2019s\u201d behavior. \nThese observers are free to attempt the task themselves and to come and go as they wish.\nChildren\u2019s soCial learning \u201cin the Wild\u201d    287\nniques in the diffusion chains may represent a form of \ncanalization, whereby the potentially limitless explora-\ntion of a problem is, instead, focused around only a subset \nof behaviors that participants see performed by others, \ncreating small-scale traditions.\nSince Horner et al. (2006) had demonstrated that it \nwas possible to run diffusion chains so effectively with \nyoung children, Flynn and Whiten (2008a) used this ap-\nproach to investigate whether sex would affect children\u2019s \nsocial learning. We noted that Lonsdorf, Eberly, and Pusey \n(2004) had found that male juvenile chimpanzees learned \nthrough direct experience in playing at a termite mound, \nwhereas females spent more time than did males watching \ntheir mothers fishing for termites and successfully fished \nfor termites over a year earlier than males, a very marked \nsex difference. Accordingly, Flynn and Whiten (2008a) \nran a diffusion experiment that contained male-only and \nfemale-only chains of children. It was hypothesized that \nif children behave like Lonsdorf et al.\u2019s chimpanzees, girls \nwould show stronger observational learning, with stronger \nfidelity to the method seeded, than would boys. The study \nalso examined age effects, with chains containing only \n3-year-olds or only 5-year-olds. We anticipated that there \nshould be a difference in fidelity between 3-year-olds and \n5-year-olds, in line with advances in cognitive skills such \nas executive functioning (Flynn, 2007) and in sociocogni-\ntive skills such as theory of mind (Flynn, 2006). However, \nwe argued that it was not possible to predict the direction \nof any such effect, since older children, relative to younger \nones, might show stronger fidelity due to their greater at-\ntention and memory skills or, in contrast, might use their \nrelatively sophisticated cognitive skills to be innovative \nand, so, be less beholden to what they had witnessed. To \nassess this, children were tested on an artificial fruit, the \nextractive-tool-use task (ETT; see Figure 2), which was a \nmore complex task than the Doorian fruit (Horner et al., \n2006). A counterpart of this task, designed to somewhat \nmimic termite fishing by wild chimpanzees, had been \nused earlier in open-diffusion experiments with this spe-\ncies (Whiten et al., 2007). For the children, the ETT was a \nplastic box that contained polystyrene beads that could be \nextracted using a tool. Two tools were available, since the \ntwo methods required alternative tools. The beads could \nbe extracted using a stabbing method in which a stab tool \nwith a pronged end could be inserted into a hole in the \nceiling of the ETT box covered by a door and the beads \ncould be stabbed and then extracted back through the hole. \nThe alternative method used a slide tool, shaped like a \nruler, that could be inserted through a slot at the base of \nthe ETT box and then used to guide the beads to a bottom-\nless chute at the opposite side of the ETT box.\nThe ETT presented a more complex task than did the \nDoorian box, since it required the use of a tool and a se-\nquence of actions (pick up tool, open a door that covered \neither hole, insert tool, hold door open, maneuver beads, \nremove beads) to access the rewards. The difference in \nlevel of difficulty from the Doorian fruit used in Horner \net al. (2006) could itself have produced different results, \nsuch as lesser fidelity across the chains. Interestingly and \nsupporting this possibility, 4 children in the no-model \nwitnessed, or whether the observers have learned merely \nthat the artificial fruit contains a reward, a goal that \nthey might then achieve through their own means\u2014that \nis, goal emulation (as in McGuigan et al., 2007). Since \ndifferent chains of individuals are seeded with an initial \nmodel trained to use one of the two methods, the principal \nresearch questions are whether the alternative methods \nseeded at the beginning will be faithfully replicated along \nthe respective chains or not and, in the latter case, whether \nthe children will switch between methods or will consis-\ntently transfer to an alternative method.\nIn the no-model control group, participants are simply \npresented with the artificial fruit individually and are al-\nlowed to interact with it, without having witnessed a mod-\nel\u2019s demonstration. This can provide two important pieces \nof information. First is the baseline level of success. Pilot \nwork will ideally have generated not a task that is so easy \nthat most children in the no-model control condition can \nextract the reward or so difficult that even children in the \nobservational-learning condition cannot master it but, in-\nstead, a task that produces a level of success somewhere \nin between. The actual level of success without benefit \nof seeing a model is then established in the control con-\ndition, for comparison with the two conditions in which \nspecific methods are seeded. Second, the control condi-\ntion also provides an indication of any preexisting biases \nin relation to the alternative methods of solution possible. \nFor example, when an artificial fruit in which a lever can \nbe pushed or pulled to access a reward is presented, if \nall the children who are successful at the task during the \nno-model control condition pull the lever, this shows that \nchildren who push the lever in the observational-learning \ncondition are more likely to have acquired this behavior \nthrough observational learning than through individual in-\nteraction with the task (a conclusion that may be validated \nthrough use of the option bias method highlighted in this \nissue by Kendal et al., 2010).\nHorner, Whiten, Flynn, and de Waal (2006) completed \nthe first diffusion chain study that had children as par-\nticipants. The study made a direct comparison between \nchains of 3-year-old children and chains of chimpanzees, \nwith both sets of chains begun by a model trained to ei-\nther slide or lift a door on an artificial Doorian fruit to \nretrieve a reward. The results showed that, like the chim-\npanzees in this experiment, 3-year-olds were faithful to \nthe method that was originally seeded, with the 8 children \nin the chain seeded with sliding consecutively sliding the \ndoor, and the 8 children in the chain seeded with lift-\ning consecutively lifting the door, so that the last child in \neach chain did what the first child had done. In the no-\nmodel control condition, 53% of the children were suc-\ncessful, 4 discovering lift and 4 discovering slide. These \nresults underline the strength of the cultural transmission \nresults, since both methods appear to be equally available \nto children of this age in their baseline behavior, so that \nthe replication of the methods along the diffusion chains \nis particularly pertinent. Similarly for the chimpanzees, \n3 of 6 control individuals opened the door, 2 discovering \nlifting and 1 discovering sliding. Horner et al. concluded \nthat the exclusive use of just one of the available tech-\n288    Flynn and Whiten\nFlynn (2008) and McGuigan and Graham (in press) \nused the diffusion chain design to address similar hypoth-\neses relating to overimitation, a phenomenon identified by \nthe copying of goal-irrelevant actions. Horner and Whiten \n(2005) investigated whether chimpanzees and 3-year-old \nchildren would copy visibly causally irrelevant actions \ndemonstrated by an experimenter. To do this, they used a \nglass ceiling box (GCB; see Figure 3), a plastic box with \na hole in the top that was defended by a bolt.\nOn one side of the GCB was a door that could be lifted \nor slid to reveal an opaque tube that contained a reward. \nThe experimenter demonstrated a series of actions, some \ndirected to the top hole and some directed to the door and \nthe tube. Actions directed to the top (removing bolts, tap-\nping into the hole) actually had no causal connection with \nretrieving the reward, for, in this case, the tool struck a \npartition (glass ceiling) lying above the tube containing \ncontrol condition found an alternative method for solving \nthe ETT, since they inserted the slide tool into the hole in \nthe ceiling and flicked the beads into the chute. Thus, the \nchildren in the observational-learning diffusion chains had \nnot only the alternative methods designed by us (stab and \nslide) available to them, but also this third method that \nat least some children invented themselves. Nevertheless, \nas in Horner et al., the results showed strong fidelity in \ncopying, with children who witnessed stab stabbing and \nchildren who witnessed slide sliding, even though sliding \nnever occurred during independent exploration of the task \nin the no-model control condition (stab was performed \nby 15\/47 control children, with the other 28 children not \nextracting a bead). Interestingly, there was a single excep-\ntion; a 3-year-old girl, who had witnessed the slide demon-\nstration, tried to complete a stab during her first attempt. \nHowever, she was unsuccessful and demonstrated sliding \nto the next child. Nevertheless, her innovation hints that, \noccasionally, children may break away from the canaliza-\ntion process that characterizes most children\u2019s approaches, \nand this could possibly initiate some cultural change.\nOverall, the results showed that both 3- and 5-year-olds \nwere capable of transmitting a tool use method horizon-\ntally along cultural generations. Five-year-olds were more \nproficient than 3-year-olds at transmitting the technique \nfaithfully across multiple generations, since 3-year-olds \nproduced more unsuccessful attempts. Yet neither 3- nor \n5-year-olds attempted to innovate when they had observed \nanother child complete the task using a particular tech-\nnique, demonstrating strong cultural canalization. Con-\ntrary to expectations, girls showed poorer transmission \nthan did boys, but this effect was found in just one of the \nfour attempts, which was when they initially attempted the \ntask in front of a naive peer. Girls were also less likely than \nboys to complete the task, even though they had witnessed \na familiar peer having two attempts at completing the task. \nHowever, we believe that this result may be a function of \nthe tool-based task used, since it may have motivated boys \nmore; thus, in future research, girls may show stronger \nfidelity to more female-centered tasks.\nA B\nFigure 2. Extractive-tool-use task. (A) Stab method. (B) Slide method.\nFigure 3. Transparent glass ceiling box with tool being tapped \ninto the upper compartment.\nChildren\u2019s soCial learning \u201cin the Wild\u201d    289\nMcGuigan and Graham (in press) independently used \na quite similar design, employing diffusion chains with \nthe GCB, but they used single chains of either 3-year-olds \nor 5-year-olds with either the opaque or the transparent \nGCB, resulting in four chains, as opposed to the eight used \nby Flynn (2008). Whereas in Flynn (2008), children had \nfour attempts (two initial attempts and two demonstra-\ntion attempts in front of the next child in the chain), the \nchildren in McGuigan and Graham had just two attempts \n(one initial and one demonstration). For the 5-year-olds \nwho were presented with the transparent GCB, the first \nchild after the model performed all the relevant and irrel-\nevant actions; however, all the subsequent children in the \nchain omitted the irrelevant bolt removals and stabbing in \nthe top hole. Five-year-olds who were presented with the \nopaque box came to omit the tool insertions into the upper \ncompartment but showed fidelity along the chains with \nregard to the bolt removals (although by the fifth child in \nthe chain, only one bolt had been removed). Thus, 5-year-\nolds appear to be more sensitive to the causal information \nthey have available to them, since they show fidelity of \ntransmission of redundant information when the causal in-\nformation is ambiguous; but when presented with clearer \ncausal relations, 5-year-olds selectively acquire only rel-\nevant behaviors. This contrasts rather strikingly with dy-\nadic experiments with the same task, which showed that \n5-year-olds persistently overimitate an adult model, even \nunder conditions in which 3-year-olds do not (McGuigan \net al., 2007).\nWhen considering the fidelity of the 3-year-olds in \nMcGuigan and Graham (in press), direct comparisons can \nbe made with Flynn (2008). Surprisingly different results \nwere obtained. Whereas Flynn (2008) found little trans-\nmission of irrelevant actions, regardless of the opaque\/\ntransparent condition, McGuigan and Graham found \nstrong transmission. As with Flynn (2008), McGuigan \nand Graham found that tapping in the top hole dropped \nout very quickly, but the transmission of the bolt removals \nwas persistent, with children along the chain even using \nthe same method that had been used to remove the bolts. \nFlynn (2008) did find that the bolt removal was more per-\nsistent than the tapping, but as was noted above, it occurred \nin only four of the eight chains and disappeared after the \nsecond child in two of the chains and after the fourth in \nthe other two chains. Finally, whereas Flynn (2008) found \nthat over 77% of the children were faithful to the method \nused to open the door to the reward, McGuigan and Gra-\nham reported weak fidelity to the method used to open \nthe door. The contrasting results may, in part, have been \ndue to the fact that in Flynn (2008), children received two \ndemonstrations, whereas in McGuigan and Graham, they \nreceived only one. Although this may explain the fidel-\nity to the door opening in Flynn (2008), it provides no \nexplanation for why the transmission of irrelevant actions \nwas strong in McGuigan and Graham, where fewer dem-\nonstrations were given. One would expect that more trials \nwould equate to a higher perceived level of intentionality \nof action on the part of the model, yet when these two \nstudies were contrasted using the most obvious method-\nological difference, more demonstrations did not equate to \nthe reward, whereas actions directed to the door and the \nsloping tube were essential for task solution. Thus, the \nmodel demonstrated a mixture of causally irrelevant and \nrelevant actions. Furthermore, the experimenter demon-\nstrated these actions on either of two different versions of \nthe GCB, one that was transparent, so that the casual irrel-\nevance of the actions was visible, and one that was opaque, \nso that the irrelevance was hidden. Horner and Whiten \n(2005) presented 3-year-old children and young chim-\npanzees with both versions of the GCB in a counterbal-\nanced order, some witnessing the demonstration with the \ntransparent GCB first, others that with the opaque GCB. \nChimpanzees showed an ability to discern that the actions \ndirected to the top of the transparent GCB were irrelevant \nand tended not to reproduce them, but they tended to re-\nproduce the relevant actions. They were able to transfer \nthis knowledge to the opaque GCB if they began with the \ntransparent GCB. However, those chimpanzees presented \nwith the opaque GCB first copied the irrelevant actions, \nsince the lack of causality of these actions could not be \ndiscerned. By contrast, the children did not show this pat-\ntern of behavior; they typically copied all actions, on both \ntransparent and opaque GCBs. Flynn (2008) hypothesized \nthat the children\u2019s indiscriminate copying may have been \ndue to the authority of the adult model in this dyadic set-\nting. If so, in diffusion chains with young children using \nthe GCB, where the demonstrator is a peer rather than an \nadult experimenter, the irrelevant actions may be more \nlikely to be filtered out. Flynn (2008) compared eight \nchains of children, containing either 2-year-olds or 3-year-\nolds, who were presented with either the opaque or the \ntransparent GCB. An initial child model was trained to use \nboth irrelevant and relevant actions. The results showed no \nsignificant difference across the eight chains based on ei-\nther age or access to causal information, as represented by \ncomparisons between the opaque and transparent GCBs. \nFor all the chains, transmission of the irrelevant actions \nnever reached the fifth and final child. Tapping into the \nupper compartment was never transmitted beyond the \nsecond child in each chain, and it was only in three of the \neight chains that the second observer actually tapped. Re-\nmoval of the bolts was slightly more robust, but again this \nnever occurred by the end of any chain, persisting only to \nthe second child in two of the eight chains and the fourth \nchild in two other chains. Flynn (2008) suggested that the \nslightly higher replication of the removal of the bolts may \nhave been a primacy effect, since bolt removal was the \nfirst action in the sequence of actions. Unlike the irrel-\nevant actions, the method used to perform the causally \nrelevant action of opening the door (lift vs. slide) in order \nto retrieve the reward showed strong fidelity, with 87% \nof the children copying the witnessed method on their \nfirst attempt and 77% or more of the children replicating \nthis method on their subsequent attempts, in line with the \nfindings in Horner et al. (2006). Flynn (2008) concluded \nthat 2- and 3-year-old children are capable of a form of \ncultural evolution\u2014that is, cumulative culture\u2014in which \nthey parse out irrelevant actions in a sequence, using the \nbehavior they had witnessed to achieve a goal but making \nit increasingly efficient as the microculture developed.\n290    Flynn and Whiten\ntions in which a method was experimentally seeded. How-\never, some extremely interesting and unexpected social \nphenomena occurred\u2014notably, in the social interactions \nover the task and the effects of social dominance. We be-\nlieve that a discussion of these in the light of the method-\nological demands of an open-diffusion design will provide \nresearchers interested in adopting such an approach with a \nrounded understanding of this methodology.\nChildren\u2019s Use of Personal and Social \nInformation When \u201cForaging\u201d for Rewards:  \nAn Open-Diffusion Study\nThe primary issue investigated within the current data \nset was whether children continue to use previously ac-\nquired personal information to solve a task when faced \nwith social information from multiple sources in a nat-\nural, open-diffusion setting, or whether they switch to \nalternative, socially acquired solutions. It may be that \npersonal information, which has previously proved cor-\nrect, will dominate a child\u2019s subsequent behavior, result-\ning in no change in the method he or she uses to extract \na reward once in an open-diffusion setting. Alternatively, \nchildren may change the method they use, on the basis of \nwhat they witness during the open diffusion. If change \ndoes occur, the motivations facilitating the change may \nbe multiple. For example, children whose asocially \nlearned method is distinct from the majority of behav-\nior they witness within the open diffusion setting may \nchoose to adopt the group\u2019s method, possibly exhibiting \nconformity (Boyd & Richerson, 1985). Alternatively, \ndifferent methods may be demonstrated by dominant or \npopular children, and children may choose to adopt these \nmethods, in line with prestige biases (Henrich & Gil-\nWhite, 2001) or in favor of methods used by friends, thus \ndemonstrating a copy-friends strategy (Laland, 2004). \nSimilar questions could also be asked of children who \nhad been unsuccessful at retrieving the reward during \nan initial asocial-learning phase but later acquired so-\ncial information leading to success (see Franz & Nunn, \n2010, for an alternative method of assessing these types \nof questions in free-living populations).\nThe study had two stages: an initial asocial-learning \nstage, in which children were presented individually with \nan artificial fruit (the serial box [SB]; see Figure 4) with \nno model present and no goal-directed instruction. This \nphase allowed the children to acquire information about \nthe task, such as how possibly to extract the reward or, in-\ndeed, what would not allow extraction of the reward. It also \nestablished whether one of the two methods to extract the \nreward was more salient. After this asocial-learning phase, \nthe SB was placed into the children\u2019s usual playgroup in \nan area for a period of time during which it was free for all \nthe children to access it. During the open- diffusion phase, \nwe videotaped and later coded which children were ma-\nnipulating the SB, whether they were successful at extract-\ning the reward, and, if so, what method they used. This \nprovided an ordered sequential record of all the children\u2019s \nattempts and successes at the task. Video records of the \nopen-diffusion phase also allowed an analysis of which \nchildren witnessed these attempts and successes.\nstronger transmission of irrelevant actions. The disparity \nin these results remains somewhat mysterious and begs \nfurther investigation.\nFinally, Hopper, Flynn, Wood, and Whiten (2010) \ncompleted a diffusion chain study using another tool use \nartificial fruit task, the panpipes (Hopper et al., 2007; \nWhiten et al., 2005). In order to retrieve a reward (a cap-\nsule containing a sticker) in this task, a tool was used to \nlift (Method A) or push (Method B) an obstruction. Hop-\nper et al. (2010) found that the method demonstrated was \ntransmitted impressively along 20 generations, twice as \nmany as has been used previously. Cultural transmission \nis a long-term phenomenon, and so it is extremely infor-\nmative and important that the microsocieties produced in \nthese diffusion studies reflect this long-term, multiple-\ngeneration transmission.\nThe small initial corpus of child diffusion studies re-\nviewed above shows that the diffusion chain design of-\nfers an informative method with which to examine social \nlearning and the transmission of behavior across groups \nof young children, thus helping to build an experimen-\ntal science of culture that extends the existing primarily \ndyadic social-learning literature. By culture, we refer to \nthe definition in Richerson and Boyd (2005): \u201cCulture is \ninformation capable of affecting individuals\u2019 behavior that \nthey acquire from other members of their species through \nteaching, imitation, and other forms of social transmis-\nsion\u201d (p. 5). The results of these studies have shown that \nchildren as young as 2 years are capable of both transmis-\nsion and refinement of a culturally transmitted technique, \nto make it more efficient (Flynn, 2008). In general, young \nchildren\u2019s actions become strongly canalized; once they \nhave observed another individual complete a task, numer-\nous options available to them in principle appear to be-\ncome closed off, and children replicate what they have \nwitnessed another individual do (Flynn & Whiten, 2008a; \nHopper et al., 2010; Horner et al., 2006). Flynn and \nWhiten (2008a) showed that diffusion chains additionally \nallow an investigation of the different theories relating to \nsocial learning. However, all five studies reviewed here \nused a diffusion chain design, which is only one of the \nthree main diffusion designs occurring in the literature \nmore generally, the others being the replacement method \nand open diffusion.\nIn the second half of this article, we introduce a study \nthat used an open-diffusion design to investigate the im-\nportance of personal and social information for children\u2019s \nsubsequent behavior. The data reported here are from a \ncontrol condition that was part of a larger study (unpub-\nlished data), in which two individual models were trained \nto use either of the two alternative methods to open a new \nartificial fruit; once trained, the models and the task were \nintroduced to each of the playgroups that the model at-\ntended. In the seeded conditions, which are not presented \nhere, we witnessed much social learning, with behaviors \nbeing spread from the original seeding. In the control con-\ndition presented here, in which no method was experi-\nmentally seeded by a trained model but diffusion was still \npossible on the basis of the children\u2019s own innovations, we \nwitnessed fewer signs of social learning than in the condi-\nChildren\u2019s soCial learning \u201cin the Wild\u201d    291\nthat a new sticker appeared under the door, through use \nof a remote control device (5 3 3 cm, small enough to be \ndiscretely held in the palm of one\u2019s hand). This rebaiting \nautomatically reestablished the defenses and extinguished \nthe lights; thus, to gain access to the new compartment, \nMethod A or B had to be implemented again.\nThe participants were 22 children who attended a \nplaygroup in the east of Scotland (mean age 5 3 years \n6 months, SD 5 6 months; range, 2 years 11 months to \n4 years 2 months; 10 males). During the initial, individual \nasocial phase, the children were brought into a quiet but \nfamiliar room in the playgroup location and were told that \n\u201clots of boys and girls have had a go and now it is your \nturn,\u201d as the experimenter pointed to the SB. The children \nwere allowed to interact with the SB until they success-\nfully extracted the sticker; until they refused to continue \nafter a prompt that included \u201cwhat do you think you do \nnow?\u201d \u201cyou can touch it as much as you like, you can\u2019t \nbreak it,\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re doing really well, what do you think \nyou do next?\u201d; or until 8 min had elapsed. Eleven chil-\ndren (50% of the whole group) were successful, 6 (55% \nof the successful children) using Method A and 4 (36% of \nthe  successful children) using Method B. One child com-\npleted both methods before she pushed open the reward \ndoor. This supported our proposal that the two methods \nwere roughly equivalent in their likelihood of spontaneous \ndiscovery. Seven of the 11 successful children (64%) did \nnot need a prompt to be successful; the remaining 4 (36%) \nThe SB was a plastic box (42 3 40 3 12 cm high), which \nwas painted so that its internal workings could not be seen, \nexcept for a clear, colorless plastic door (5 3 5 cm) in \nthe center of the upper surface, which allowed access to a \ncompartment containing a sticker. This compartment was \nilluminated, and so, the desirable sticker was clearly vis-\nible. The door was held in place by a number of defenses, \nwhich could be released by using one of two methods: \nMethod A (push Lever A, then turn Knob 1) resulted in \nthe door\u2019s opening by sliding it toward oneself (if one \nwas seated facing the SB, as in Figure 4); Method B (turn \nKnob 2 and then push Lever B) allowed the door to be \nopened by sliding it away from oneself. The two methods \nwere designed to be equivalent in effort, ease, and success. \nThus, unlike previous artificial fruit tasks\u2014for example, \nthe ETT (Flynn & Whiten, 2008a)\u2014we expected that there \nwould be no predisposition to use one particular method \nover the other. Two buttons sat on top of the SB, and when \none button was pressed, a red light was illuminated on \nthe surface of the box, whereas pressing the other illumi-\nnated an orange light. Knobs 1 and 2 could also be pressed \ndown, resulting in green and white lights, respectively, \nbeing illuminated. These light-related actions in fact had \nno causal role in opening the door (unlike the essential \nlever and knob operations) and were designed to be poten-\ntial distractors with scope for testing overimitation. Inside \nthe SB was a wheel with 12 compartments, each contain-\ning a sticker. The experimenter could rotate the wheel, so \nFigure 4. Serial box (SB). The door at the center of the roof could be opened to reveal a compartment containing \na reward; the compartment was part of a larger wheel of 12 compartments (each containing a reward) that could \nbe moved by remote control. The door was held in place by a number of defenses and was released through two \nmethods: Method A (push Lever A, then turn Knob 1) and Method B (turn Knob 2, and then push Lever B). The \nroof of the SB also contained two buttons, one on each side. Each button illuminated a different colored light (or-\nange or red). A further light on each side could be illuminated by pressing each of the knobs (Knob 1 illuminated \nthe green light, and the pink knob illuminated the white light).\n292    Flynn and Whiten\ntheir successes; however, by the second day, all the chil-\ndren\u2019s successes were achieved using the same method, B. \nThis convergence suggests some degree of social conform-\nity, since the initial, asocial-learning phase showed that the \ntwo methods were within the group\u2019s repertoire at similar \nlevels (A was, in fact, slightly more common than B), al-\nthough caution is required, since 11 asocial-learning con-\ntrols cannot unequivocally allow one to determine that \nthere was no bias in the use of Method B over A. But the \nresults suggest that there was not a trend toward the use \nof Method B over Method A in the open-diffusion phase \nsimply because it was the children\u2019s predisposed method, \nsince, of those children who responded in the open-\n diffusion phase, there was no prior asocially learned bias \nfor Method B over A. Indeed, the swing to the Method B \nmonoculture on Day 2 was to the method that had been \nmost commonly seen (67% of cases) on Day 1. It is not \npossible to further probe these events statistically, insofar \nas the number of children working on the SB, and particu-\nlarly those who changed their method, was too small.\nA second noteworthy finding was the variation in be-\nhavior. For example, 11 children learned asocially, but 11 \ndid not. Then 5 of those who learned asocially also learned \nsocially, whereas 6 did not. Five children who learned \nasocially did not try again with the task, whereas 1 did \nand kept the same method, although he made only one \nattempt. Five others chose to change method from that \nlearned through asocial learning to that witnessed during \nthe open-diffusion phase. Whether a clearer pattern would \nhave emerged with a larger sample or more time is un-\nknown, but the data here suggest that cultural learning in \nsuch an everyday context can be both flexible and varied.\nThe critical difference between this study and our other \nopen-diffusion studies (Whiten & Flynn, in press) and, \nindeed, other diffusion chain and dyadic studies was that \nthis study included an initial asocial phase, in which the \nchildren had a chance to acquire some information about \nthe task. During this initial phase, 50% of the children \nwere able to successfully remove the sticker, using a rela-\ntively balanced mixture of Method A and Method B. Thus, \nit would appear that the SB was a good task to use within \nan open diffusion, insofar as a number of participants were \nnot initially successful at the task but there were also mod-\nels who had been successful, from whom the unsuccessful \nchildren could learn. However, such extensive learning \ndid not appear to happen; instead, only 55% of the chil-\ndren from the playgroup attempted the task in the open-\ndiffusion phase. We hypothesize that one of two things \nmay have happened. Children who had been successful in \nthe asocial phase may have had their interest in the SB sa-\ntiated; that is, having been successful they were not as mo-\ntivated to acquire the sticker reward in the open-diffusion \nphase. Similarly, for children who had been unsuccessful \non the SB during the asocial phase, their motivation may \nhave been reduced, since they had attempted the task and \nhad become frustrated and, essentially, had learned that \nthey \u201ccouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\nAn additional factor was that one child, E.M., domi-\nnated attempts on the task, producing 65% of the total ex-\nwere successful after a prompt. It took the unprompted \nchildren a mean of 2 min 13 sec to be successful (range, \n57 sec to 4 min 20 sec); those who were prompted were \nsuccessful in 5 min 44 sec (range, 2 min 40 sec to 7 min \n40 sec), therefore providing an overall mean success time \nof 3 min 29 sec. The mean time spent interacting with the \ntask for the children who were not successful was 5 min \n29 sec (range, 2 min 27 sec to 8 min 18 sec). There was \nno difference between the children who were successful \nat extracting the reward and children who were not suc-\ncessful according to age [mean (no success) 5 43 months, \nmean (success) 5 41 months; t(20) 5 0.69, p 5 .49] or sex \n[male:female ratio (no success) 5 5:6, (success) 5 6:5; \nt(20) 5 0.41, p 5 .69]. Children who retrieved the sticker \nwere allowed to keep it, and children who were unsuccess-\nful were given a sticker at the end of their participation.\nThe day after the asocial-learning phase, the open-\ndiffusion phase began. The SB was placed in an area of \nthe nursery that was accessible to all the children during \na time when all the children were free to attempt it. This \nwas done for 2 days for an hour on each day. The behavior \ndemonstrated over the 2 days is illustrated in Figure 5.\nThere were 91 successful extractions of the reward \nfrom the SB, 30 using Method A (33%) and 60 using \nMethod B (67%). Although all 22 children from the first \nphase had access to the SB, only 12 (55% of the total) \nattempted the task during the open-diffusion phase. Of \nthese, 6 had been successful and 6 had been unsuccessful \nduring the asocial-learning phase. Six children who had \nbeen successful during the asocial-learning phase were \nsuccessful during the open-diffusion phase. Four used the \nsame method as that acquired during the asocial-learning \nphase for their first success in the open-diffusion phase. \nHowever, 2 children (E.C. and L.R.) changed to Method B \non their first success and produced a successful extrac-\ntion by undertaking a collaborative coaction, with each of \nthem completing one element of the method (see Figure 5, \nBout 1). Five of the 6 children who had been successful \nin the asocial-learning phase used both methods during \nthe open-diffusion phase; the other child (G.F.) produced \nonly one success during the open-diffusion phase. Two of \nthese 5 children (E.C. and L.R.) produced a new method \nthrough collaboration (as described previously); the other \n3 (E.M., G.M., and H.L.) all showed evidence of adopt-\ning a new method after having witnessed it being used by \nanother child (as illustrated by the arrows in Figure 5). \nA further 6 children who had been unsuccessful during \nthe asocial-learning phase attempted the SB during the \nopen-diffusion phase; 3 of these (P.G., H.S., and M.C.) \nsuccessfully retrieved the reward from the SB during the \nopen-diffusion phase. P.G. replicated what he had previ-\nously witnessed during the open-diffusion phase, and H.S. \nand M.C. participated in separate collaborative attempts \n(see Figure 5, Bouts 8 and 10). Of the 9 children who \nwere successful during the open-diffusion phase, 4 used \nboth methods, 3 were faithful to a single method (all used \nMethod B), and 2 produced only one attempt.\nOne key finding across the 2 days was that during the \nfirst day, children used a mixture of methods to achieve \nChildren\u2019s soCial learning \u201cin the Wild\u201d    293\nE.C.

There \nwere seven further bouts on the SB by M.C. and E.C., but these all used Method B.\n294    Flynn and Whiten\nconcluding that \u201cscrounging appeared to be the primary \ndriver of technique acquisition\u201d (p. 255). Reasons for the \ndifferent positive and negative results have not been re-\nsolved. It is typically assumed that the negative effects \narise from consistent scroungers\u2019 simply not needing to \nlearn, so long as they can maintain their parasitic success. \nThe positive effects may arise from the intimacy with the \nmodel and the task that scrounging can facilitate, with \nwhat has been learned revealed only when the scrounger \nlacks a tolerant producer to exploit and must deal with the \ntask itself. Indeed, it would be interesting to test whether \nscroungers in the studies reporting negative results would \nshow positive results where opportunities for scrounging \ncease. Against the background of these comparative stud-\nies, it would be of interest to generate a statistically larger \nsample of scrounging than that uncovered in this first ex-\nploratory study and examine whether such behavior does, \nindeed, inhibit or facilitate learning, both in the produce\u2013\nscrounger context (predicted negative effect) and where \nscrounging opportunities no longer exist (predicted posi-\ntive effect). We note that scrounging is a phenomenon \ndiscovered only in the open-diffusion design; in other ex-\nperimental designs, observers are explicitly not allowed to \ninteract with the task at the same time as the demonstrator, \nand so, scrounging effects will not be seen. Using open \ndiffusion allows the study of this natural phenomenon.\nHowever, such studies should also take account of the \ndifferences in the tone of such interactions, which we have \ndistinguished as active versus passive scrounging. The key \npoint is that although some scrounging appears essentially \ncompetitive (corresponding to some of the animal behav-\nior cases), other cases involve interactions more appro-\npriately described as cooperative. Indeed, more broadly, \nsocial learning in the context of joint, even collaborative, \ninteractions (Tomasello, Kruger, & Ratner, 1993) between \nchildren working together on a task like the SB should be \na point of attention in future studies.\nFinally, it is worth reflecting on the methodological \ndemands of undertaking an open-diffusion design with \nyoung children, some of which have been highlighted by \nthis study and some of which have not. An initial question \nrelates to why people have not attempted open-diffusion \nstudies with children, especially since the corpus of open-\ndiffusion studies with nonhuman animals is steadily grow-\ning and diffusion chains with young children have been \nshown to be very informative. Obviously, open-diffusion \nstudies are challenging to undertake, since they require in-\ntensive examination of a process of change within a group \nof individuals. But this is true of open-diffusion studies \nwith both humans and nonhumans. Yet carrying out open \ndiffusion with humans, especially children, has added dif-\nficulties. First, informed consent must be given by parents \nand playgroup staff, and children must also be willing to \nparticipate. A critical point of open diffusion is that it is \nnaturalistic and occurs in a child\u2019s usual playgroup area \n(\u201cin the wild\u201d); thus, the ideal situation is to get all play-\ngroup parents and children to consent, so that the whole \nmicrosociety can be studied as one coherent and natural \nphenomenon. Even if one or two children decline to par-\nticipate, this can change the dynamics of the environment \ntractions. However, this does not fully explain the lack of \nparticipation of the other children, since there were long \nperiods in which either E.M. was not working on the task \nand other children were or the task was free for any child \nto attempt it.\nFuture work might ameliorate the lack of motivation \nwe inferred to be due to satiation or frustration by using \na higher value, more desirable, and thus more motivat-\ning reward, whether from the beginning or from the start \nof the open-diffusion phase. However, it should be noted \nthat stickers similar to those used in the present task have \nbeen used in our other open-diffusion studies, which have \nshown a high level of social learning (Whiten & Flynn, \nin press). It may simply be that for children of the age we \nstudied, the prime motivation for social learning about \nrelevant manipulative techniques relies typically on the \nchild\u2019s not already having a successful technique in his\/\nher repertoire, which in the present study, we undercut \nthrough the initial individual-learning phase. Having said \nthis, for those children who did participate, the shift to \nthe monoculture of Day 2 suggests a substantial effect of \nsocial learning and conformity.\nAn interesting and unexpected phenomenon was that \nthe children sometimes worked on the task together (e.g., \nFigure 5 illustrates 10 incidents of coaction), and more-\nover, this also involved a degree of scrounging, where \nchildren who had not removed defenses nevertheless ex-\ntracted the reward. The defenses and door to the reward \nwere spread across the top of the SB (Figure 4), such that \nthe children could manipulate the door (either by quickly \nopening the door or by sitting with their hand on the door) \nwhile another child was manipulating the defenses and \nreleasing the door. On 40% of the extractions, a child ob-\ntained a reward when they had not released the defenses, \neither because they essentially \u201cstole\u201d the reward (i.e., got \nto the reward before the child who had removed the de-\nfenses [14%]) or because the reward was given to them or \nthey were invited to extract the reward by the child who \nhad the removed the defenses (26%). We can describe the \ndifferent roles children take in such an open-diffusion task \nas enablers (or producers who remove the defenses), ac-\ntive scroungers (who take hold of a door to acquire a re-\nward, although not having removed the defenses), or pas-\nsive scroungers (waiting to be given a reward or invited to \nextract a reward).\nThese findings are of interest in relation to a significant \nliterature on the relation between scrounging and social \nlearning in the animal behavior literature. This relates to \na long-standing distinction in behavioral ecology between \nproducers, who actively gain food items, and scroungers, \nwho manage merely to take resulting scraps or even steal \nwhole items (Barnard & Sibly, 1981). However, there are \ncontrary findings on whether scrounging inhibits or fa-\ncilitates social learning. Several studies have indicated \nthe former, shown in the course of experimental studies \nof foraging pigeons (Giraldeau & Lefebvre, 1987; Gi-\nraldeau & Templeton, 1991). However, other experiments \nhave shown scrounging to facilitate social learning\u2014for \nexample, in marmosets (Caldwell & Whiten, 2003) and \nmeerkats (Thornton & Malapert, 2009), the latter even \nChildren\u2019s soCial learning \u201cin the Wild\u201d    295\ntemperamental\/ personality factors, affects the cultural \ntransmission of behavior across groups.\nAUThOR NOTE\nThis study was supported by a grant from the Economic and Social \nResearch Council (RES000230603) to A.W., who was also supported by \na Leverhulme Trust Major Research Grant and a Royal Society Lever-\nhulme Trust Senior Research Fellowship.

Such a problem is not usual with nonhuman \nanimals, since although an individual may decide not to \nparticipate, that individual is not actively removed from \nthe testing session by the experimenter. Second, children \nshow forms of social learning that are rare, if not nonexis-\ntent, in nonhuman animals. For example, as has been seen \nin this study, children may cooperate actively and inten-\ntionally with one another. Or, as has been seen in many \nother studies (e.g., Ashley & Tomasello, 1998; Whiten & \nFlynn, in press), they may teach one another, using direct \nverbal instructions as to how to solve a task. These alter-\nnative forms of social learning mean that not only does \nphysical behavior need to be coded, but so does verbal \nbehavior, which results in a complex teasing apart of the \nlearning processes. On the other hand, it is undeniable \nthat open-diffusion studies with young children are ex-\ntremely informative in establishing how children learn in \ntheir usual environment, providing important information \nabout how behavior is spread through a group. Finally, \nmethodologically, using children can be very beneficial, \nsince, once recruited, larger samples of these \u201ccultural \nmagnets\u201d (Flynn, 2008) can be used, and the behavior in \nmultiple, large groups can be compared to address spe-\ncific theoretical questions, something that is not always \npossible with nonhuman species.\nConclusions and Future Avenues\nWe hope that we have convinced readers that it is pos-\nsible to investigate children\u2019s social learning \u201cin the wild,\u201d \nusing experimental techniques that allow specific hypoth-\neses to be addressed. Obviously, the different diffusion \nmethods provide different levels of experimental control \nand accommodate or allow different levels of \u201cwildness\u201d; \nbut it is clear that even with the most controlled of the dif-\nfusion methods, diffusion chains, we see a significant shift \ntoward ecological validity, as compared with the usual dy-\nadic experimental setting, since children learn from other, \nfamiliar children, alone or within groups, often in their \nusual playgroup. Now is a fruitful time to use diffusion \nmethods to investigate children\u2019s social learning and the \nlarger phenomenon of culture. Such investigation will \nneed to include such questions as those sketched at the \nbeginning of this article. For example, what is the role of \nselective learning (whether one copies means or goals, for \ninstance)? Do we see fidelity to means across all tasks or \njust the artificial fruits that we use within our research, \nand is fidelity to means lessened in an open-diffusion \nversus a dyadic setting? Do individual differences in the \nostensive cues that children provide in these natural set-\ntings affect the fidelity with which others copy them? If \na model within an open-diffusion setting is trained to use \nirrelevant actions on a task, do these irrelevant actions get \ncopied? The findings of Flynn (2008) would suggest not, \nbut perhaps there are individual differences in the likeli-\nhood of whether a child will copy such irrelevant actions. \nFinally, to date and to our knowledge, there have been \nno replacement diffusion studies with young children. \nSuch a method may offer great opportunities to explore \nsuch questions as how the makeup of different groups, \nwhether based on sex mix, age mix, task expertise, or \n296    Flynn and Whiten\ntransmission experiments in understanding human cultural evolution. \nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 363, 3489-3501. \ndoi:10.1098\/rstb.2008.0129\nNielsen, M.
