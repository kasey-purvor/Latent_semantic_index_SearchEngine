Land, Conflict and Justice: A Political Theory of Territory, Cambridge: Cambridge \nUniversity Press. \nJeremy Larkins (2010). From Hierarchy to Anarchy: Territory and Politics before Westphalia. London: \nPalgrave. \n \nFor a long time territory was the dead, the fixed, the immobile, the under-examined. At least, so the \nbooks under review here argue in different ways, within political science, political philosophy and \ninternational relations. Political geography has, of course, long seen territory as one of its key concepts. \nYet if political geographers have offered a range of excellent, detailed accounts of territories, there has \nbeen less examination of \u2018territory\u2019. As I and others have suggested, territory is all too often seen by \ngeographers as a relatively straight-forward concept, something that can be understood as a bounded \nspace under the control of a group, perhaps a state, or an outcome of territoriality (Elden forthcoming, \nand the references therein). The complications come, so it is assumed, from particular instances of \nterritorial configurations or disputes, not from the notion itself. These three books appear to be \ninstances of a small but noticeable shift. Attention is being paid to the notion of territory in a way that \nhad become unusual (see also Sassen 2006; Cowen & Gilbert eds. 2007, Jones 2007, Elden 2009). None \nof the three writers discussed here is a geographer: Kolers teaches in a philosophy programme, while \nGoddard and Larkins are in political science. Yet in terms of approach, Kolers and Goddard are the \nclosest, working within a particular type of political theory or philosophy, while Larkins is engaging with \nthese issues from the perspective of international relations and history.  \nGoddard\u2019s work provides a powerful analysis of two seemingly intractable territorial disputes: Northern \nIreland and Jerusalem (see also Goddard 2006; Hassner 2006\/07; Goddard et. al. 2007\/08). Both of \nthese seem, Goddard suggests, to be indivisible solutions, where one side\u2019s gain would be the others \nloss, where what would be acceptable to one is unacceptable to the other. This then is the key \ntheoretical contribution of the study; the extension of the idea of indivisibility to territory. Indivisibility is \nargued to be \u2018a contingent outcome, one that is very much the product of human action\u2019 (p. 4). The \nstrength of the book is to be found in the two substantive parts, where Goddard provides a detailed and \nnuanced account of the claims made by all sides in the conflicts. If some criticisms might be made\u2014the \nanalysis of Jerusalem seems to be largely reliant on different views from within the Western and Israeli \nacademies and public spheres, and issues of language seem strangely underplayed (though see p. 181)\u2014\nthey are on the whole extremely interesting and striking discussions of these complicated cases. \nGoddard\u2019s claim is that the indivisible nature of these cases is a social construction. She notes how \n2 \n \nJerusalem was divided between 1948 and 1967, and that Northern Ireland has proved to be a place \nwhere compromise is possible. By showing that they have been understood in different ways at \ndifferent times, Goddard is able to demonstrate that solutions are possible, though she certainly does \nnot think they are simply reached. \nOne peculiar aspect of the analysis offered here is that there is little discussion of what Jerusalem is, in \nterms of its territorial extent. There are some references to how an ambiguity over its definition might \nbe part of a solution (i.e. pp. 200-1, 238), but little discussion of different ways of seeing the city. Is it the \nold city, its suburbs, or much wider areas? There is discussion of annexation, but this is solely the 1967 \nIsraeli annexation of the Jordanian part of Jerusalem. This is a crucial issue though, because Jerusalem is \nnot a static entity. In the Western media illegal settlements in the West Bank are sometimes described \nas \u2018a suburb of Jerusalem\u2019, thus showing how the borders can be stretched further (see, though, p. 158). \nThere is also some ambiguity about what Palestinians are actually claiming. Are they, like many parts of \nthe Israeli voice, claiming the whole of Jerusalem, complete and undivided? Or are they claiming only \nparts, which are denied by Israelis who want either the same places or hold to the idea of its \nindivisibility. Similarly, in the case of Northern Ireland, it is the boundary drawn around this that is a \ncrucial issue. To claim that it is for the people to decide its future already presupposes a decision has \nbeen made as to who is included within the territorial frame. Different perspectives in the debate would \nsee the 1921 division as part of the problem; not to be taken as the definition of who should decide its \nsolution. These issues, which would seem crucial for the political geography of these questions, are \nstrangely underplayed. The way the problem is spatially represented and divided is part of the \nconstruction of its indivisibility. Yet there are considerable resources here for those interested to \nexplore further. \nThe book is not as successful in conceptual terms. Goddard relies on a largely uncomplicated notion of \nterritory in order to show how it is constructed as indivisible. No definition of territory is forthcoming, \neven in terms of showing how it might only be possible to show how it has been understood in different \ntimes and places. Indexes can be misleading, but territory does not merit an entry. While this might be \nsaid to be because it is discussed throughout, indivisibility, indivisible territory and legitimacy, for which \nsimilar claims could be made, all receive extensive reference and subdivision. Nor is this corrected in \nterms of the book\u2019s focus. At no point do we get a sense of how territory itself is constructed; rather \nthan simply particular ways of seeing it as indivisible. On the other hand, the notion of an issue being \nindivisible is given quite extensive treatment, drawing on a range of sources, and subjecting them to \ncritique (Ch. 1). The most we get is an assertion of how indivisibility relates to territory, the claim being \n\u2018that far from being an inherent characteristic of territory, indivisibility is a political construct\u2019 (p. 240). \nOutside of claims by hard-line politicians, it is difficult to think of a theorist of territory who would argue \nthe opposite, making this particular argument perhaps less significant than Goddard thinks. The book \nthen is an important contribution to the two particular sites studied, and work on territorial disputes \nand to theories of indivisibility, but it is much less helpfull for those that want to understand territory.  \nA similar argument on the conceptual side could be made of Kolers\u2019s book. While the title promises a \ngreat deal that should transcend any specific focus, the book is much more concerned with how justice \n3 \n \narguments can be applied to territorial conflict than with either territory or conflict in themselves. Kolers \napplies theories of justice (understood themselves to be subject to high degrees of conceptual \nspecificity) to an unproblematic space. The book is a liberal justice theory of territorial issues, rather \nthan its subtitle promise of a political theory of territory. The application of the theory in chapter six is \nlargely devoted to an analysis of Israel.  \nKolers looks at almost no literature on territory. Indeed, he claims that state territory has been almost \ncompletely ignored by political philosophers (pp. 1, 67). He pushes the claim by suggesting that what \ndoes exist is \u2018by and large, perfunctory and unsystematic insofar as it deals with territory and territorial \nrights\u2019 (p. 2). He suggests that \u2018as far as I can tell not a single other work in political philosophy pauses at \nany length to consider what territory is\u2019 (p. 4). It depends who is included in political philosophy, of \ncourse, since William Connolly has hardly ignored such issues (see, for example 1995). But by ignoring \nother disciplines, and excluding anything not originally written in English, he is walking through the \nlibrary with blinkers. Kolers mentions a couple of encounters with the discipline of geography (p. xi and \nxiii) but these appear to have had little impact on his work. The exception is his use of Robert Sack\u2019s \npioneering study of human territoriality (1986), though he wishes to restrict its findings to what he calls \njuridical territory, i.e. state territory (pp. 4, 10 n. 1, 72-3). Yet this is read entirely without context. In the \nearly twentieth century animal ethologists used a human category with a complicated history\u2014\nterritory\u2014to understand animal behaviour. They named these processes territoriality, adopting a word \nmeaning the condition of territory to invoke a more active sense of shaping it. Some human geographers \nbegan to utilise these ideas, seeing human behaviour as amenable to theorisation along such lines. Sack, \namong others, challenged the behaviourist assumptions behind such accounts, to see territoriality as a \nsocial strategy rather than biological drive. Such a potted history may appear a little crude, but it should \ncaution us in any uncritical use of Sack, or theories of territoriality more generally, as a means by which \nto understand (state) territory: it is working backwards through some very muddy waters. Does \nterritoriality, which is said to pertain to social control of space at multiple scales and throughout human \nhistory, really allow us to understand the specificities of the relations between the modern state and its \nterritorial extent? \nGiven the audacity of Kolers\u2019s claims about the neglect and his own originality, it is astonishing how \nmundane his own definitions of territory actually are. Often these are the kinds of things that would be \nbarely acceptable in an undergraduate text: \u2018a territory is a geographical place that is bounded and \ncontrolled in part through geographical means such as the establishment of physical boundaries or \nother means of demarcation\u2019 (p. 4); \u2018most fundamentally, state territory \u2013 a country \u2013 is a kind of place\u2019 \n(p. 69). This is in stark contrast to the extensive discussion of the theories of justice that might apply to \nterritorial disputes; issues that take up the vast bulk of this study. Kolers defines his core thesis in the \nfollowing way: \nA territorial right exists if and only if an ethnographic community demonstrably achieves \nplenitude in a juridical territory; this right grounds independent statehood only if there is no \ncompeting right and the territory is a country (p. 5). \n4 \n \nIt seems that for Kolers the most complicated terms\u2014and the ones he spends most time unpacking, are \nthe ones concerning justice and rights. The analysis of Israel is perhaps restricted for this reason. He \ndescribes situations akin to Goddard\u2019s indivisible territory as situations which are \u2018territorially \nincompatible\u2019 (p. 25). I am aware of the difficulties in providing a balanced, let alone neutral, discussion \nof the Israel\/Palestine situation, so I do not want to pick on nuances of language unfairly. But one \nexample perhaps shows how the neglect of geographical questions restricts the ability to analyse. This is \nthe map on p. 193, which is a representation of how the situation in 1949 could have been solved along \nthe lines Bill Clinton proposed in 2000 at Camp David. It shows Gaza and the West Bank as the \u2018proposed \nPalestinian State\u2019, as contiguous landmasses, with relatively small areas annexed to Israel, and notes, \nbut does not show, some exchange the other way. Put like this it seems strange that Palestinian \nnegotiators did not sign up to the accord.  But even Israeli negotiators have said that the Palestinians \nwere right to refuse. The reason, in part, is because what was being offered was not nearly as simple as \na landmass enclosed in a border. There were areas where the Palestinians would share control; \nrestrictions on their sovereignty everywhere, especially in terms of aerial and maritime sovereignty; and \na whole set of cuts, divisions and breaks in the land (the map on p. 205 shows the plural and overlapping \njurisdictions much more clearly). I am not simply suggesting that Kolers\u2019s project is one-sided: the \nproposed solution (pp. 207, 213-5) actually offers something that many Israelis would find difficult to \ncountenance, rejecting both the cosmopolitan one-state and the nationalist two-state solutions (p. 190, \n214). It has problems, certainly, but may provide the impetus for a discussion that breaks with a fairly \nrestrictive set of possibilities. That is to be welcomed. But the issue here is not that the argument is \nflawed politically but that it is deficient theoretically, and precisely because it fails to adequately \nproblematise the notion of territory: conceptually or historically. \nIn terms of tracing a history, Larkins offers much more of an intervention. It is perhaps the most \ninteresting of the books under review here: it is certainly the most ambitious. Larkins argues \nconvincingly that international relations has, for too long, taken an unproblematic sense of territory as a \ngiven, the ground upon which its concerns play out. Larkins rather unhelpfully labels this as the \n\u2018territorial a priori\u2019, suggesting that it functions for IR much the same as space and time did for Kant, \npure intuitions, structuring experience rather than things experienced. Yet space and time were subject \nto intensive analysis by Kant, in terms of their ontological status, something that neither Larkins nor IR \nprovides for territory. Indeed, it is questionable if territory does indeed have that status in IR, or rather \nwhether it is more simply an under-examined issue, largely assumed rather than interrogated. He does \nprovide some analysis of what the term \u2018territory\u2019 might mean, though this is largely second hand, and \nsomewhat peculiarly, through the very brief discussion in Alexander Wendt\u2019s Social Theory of \nInternational Relations (p. 21; Wendt 1999, p. 211). Like Kolers, Larkins makes use of Sack to bolster his \nargument. Yet as noted above, Sack uses \u2018territoriality\u2019 to describe an active strategy, rather than the \nolder sense of the word to describe a condition of territory. While there are persistent equivocations \nbetween these meanings throughout his study, Larkins offers some helpful criticisms of how Sack, too, \nremains committed to an epistemic realism (p. 36). His broad claim is to conceive of territory less as a \nmaterial object than \u2018as an idea, a component of the social imaginary that is produced in discourse\u2019 (p. \n35). While the challenge to the static, material understanding is helpful, to see it solely as imagined is \n5 \n \nequally problematic. Rather, as Lefebvre argued with space, it is the combination of a range of factors\u2014\nmaterial and representational, and as embodied in lived practice\u2014which are then historically \nunderstood that is important (Brenner and Elden 2009). Despite some discussion of Lefebvre, Larkins \nends up insisting that Lefebvre\u2019s notion of the \u2018conceived space or representations of space\u2019 is the \u2018most \nimportant\u2019 for his study (p. 38). At one point Larkins criticises John Ruggie for uncritically combining a \nrange of different theoretical resources, and for lacking \u2018methodological rigor\u2019 (p. 43). This is a criticism \nto which his own theoretical forays are not immune. \nLarkins is on more secure ground when he challenges the IR orthodoxy of the modern system of \nterritorial states as coming into being with the 1648 Treaties of Westphalia. This mainstay has been \nconvincingly criticised in recent years (Krasner 1993; Osiander 2001; Teschke 2003, for example), but \nretains its power as a shorthand or shortcut. Larkins argues that this is constructed, in part, on a \nsimplistic division between medieval and modern worldviews. His tactic, in part, is to show that this is \nonly possible because the period of the Renaissance is written out of the story. He is attuned to the \ndebates about the meaning of these time periods, but retains the label to look at a period that \nencompasses cultural, political and theoretical changes of some magnitude. His sources range fairly \nwidely, including painting, philosophy and literature, alongside political theory, where the focus is on \nNiccol\u00f2 Machiavelli. Larkins therefore argues that the \u2018origins of the territorial a priori\u2019 are not to be \nfound in the early modern period of Descartes and Westphalia, but rather in \u2018the widespread revolution \nin the conceptualisation and representation of space that occurred during the Renaissance\u2019 (pp. 33-4). \nThis is a plausible suggestion, inasmuch as any straight-forward \u2018origins\u2019 can be found, although it too \nrelies on rather crudely epochal understandings\u2014the medieval period and the modern understood as \nthe hierarchy and anarchy of the title; with the Renaissance bridging and complicating the story.  \nThe reading of Machiavelli is one of the most important parts of the book. Larkins follows Machiavelli as \nseeing the 1494 French invasion of Italy as significant moment in challenging both political practice\u2014the \nindependence of Italian city-states\u2014and political ideas. Larkins, partly following Foucault\u2019s \ncharacterisation, sees Machiavelli as directing the prince or ruler\u2019s power first towards a territory. \nLarkins\u2019s corrective to Foucault is that the prince\u2019s relation to the territory that is the \u2018objective \ncomponent of his jurisdiction\u2019 (p. 130) is \u2018fragile, synthetic, and permanently threatened by external \nenemies and internal opponents\u2019 (p. 131). He agrees with Foucault that \u2018territory is a fundamental \ncomponent of Machiavellian sovereignty\u2019, while countering that \u2018the sovereign prince is estranged from \nthe territories which define his sovereignty\u2019 (p. 131). Yet Machiavelli never uses a word that can be \nstraight-forwardly rendered as \u2018territory\u2019, not deploying the Italian word current at his time territorio, \nand though he does talk of site, land and dominion\u2014sito, terre, dominio\u2014the relation between these \nand the question of rule is never straight-forward. Indeed, most of the recent English translations of \nboth Il Principe and the Discorsi suggest that lo stato, perhaps the key word of Machiavelli\u2019s political \nvocabulary, must sometimes be translated as \u2018territory\u2019 to make sense of what he is arguing. But this is \nto assume Machiavelli must have meant or implied this; rather than recognising that he may have had \ngood reasons not for using the term or that his object of rule was understood rather differently. \n6 \n \nIn place of the \u2018territorial a priori\u2019, Larkins proposes a notion of a \u2018territorial imaginary\u2019, which is claimed \nto be a \u2018more fluid concept\u2026 which emphasizes the historically contingent, transformative, and \nsubjective nature of sovereign-territory\u2019 (p. 196). He is therefore critical of \u2018universal, fixed, and \nobjective\u2019 understandings of territory, and wants to suggest that territory should not be solely \nunderstood \u2018within the domain of political discourse\u2019 (p. 196). These are worthwhile sentiments, and as \nguidelines for future work are hard to contest. The most problematic element of this idea in the book \nthough is the insistence on talking of such things as the \u2018medieval territorial imaginary\u2019 (p. 74, for \ninstance). What this means is not at all clear. Does it imply that the medieval period had a particular \nterritorial imaginary, which just happens to differ from the modern or Renaissance imaginaries? But this \nis to suggest a conceptual vocabulary which did not exist: territorium is a relatively rare term in Medieval \nLatin, and was not used in political theory. If \u2018territory\u2019 is to be historically examined then the word, the \nconcept and the practice all need to be examined historically. To suggest that \u2018Innocent IV claimed that \nas vicarious Christi papal plenitudo potestatis had global territorial extension\u2019 (p. 81) is grossly \nanachronistic. This approach seems to imply that territory has simply been differently ordered at \ndifferent times, a claim similar to that advanced by Sassen (2006), rather than the more radical claim \nthat the term territory emerged as a way of describing a particular and historically limited set of \npractices and ideas about\u2014to try to use relatively neutral terms for a moment\u2014the relation between \nplace and power. When Larkins claims that \u2018the Renaissance made possible the modern conception of a \nterritorial imaginary, no longer governed by the spatial motif of above\/below, but authorized by the \noppositional figure of inside\/outside\u2019 (p. 196), it is difficult to see how much he differs from the standard \nstory of IR. He is surely right that with odd exceptions the Renaissance has been written out of the \nhistory of that discipline (see Mattingly 1955; and more recently Bratchell 2008; Descendre 2009). But is \nhe simply pushing the date for the emergence of a modern understanding back, or suggesting that the \nRenaissance made possible later developments? That would be a poor reward for his labours: there are \nresources in this book for a much more challenging account. \nOne thing that readers of this journal may find surprising is the lack of attention paid, in all these books, \nto the work geographers have done on territorial issues. Goddard briefly mentions Alexander Murphy\u2019s \n1990 Annals article and a couple of pieces by David Newman on Israel; Larkins draws on Sack, John \nAgnew, Denis Cosgrove, and David Harvey in a few places, but these are both books largely shaped by \ntheir own disciplinary affiliations. Kolers is by far the worst offender, taking account of almost no \nwritings on territory, using Sack on territoriality (and briefly Tim Cresswell on place) as his principle \nguide, and making it appear as though he is working in largely uncharted waters. None of these authors \nreferences a single article that has been published in Political Geography. The response should be the \nreverse: political geographers would do well to engage with the arguments these three books have to \noffer, in particular Goddard\u2019s empirical detail and Larkins\u2019s work on the Renaissance. In broader terms \nthough geographers might want to ask why it is that their works have apparently proved so little use to \npolitical scientists, theorists and philosophers who are today grappling with these issues. While \ninstitutional and disciplinary politics may play a role, the reason is surely more than this. One possibility \nis that it is down, in part, to the difference between work on territories and work on \u2018territory\u2019. A more \n7 \n \nproperly historical and conceptual approach to territory might have helped these works through some \nof their geographical difficulties.  \n \nReferences \n \nBratchell, M.E.
