It uses a \ncombination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to further our understanding of how \nimportant a variety of items are in the decision to work abroad. Employing a mutual dependency \nperspective it contrasts individual motives and organizational perspectives. Organizations \nsignificantly underestimate the importance of career, work\/life balance and development \nconsiderations and overestimate the financial imperative and some family motives. The analysis \nshowed that for individuals some of these factors significantly relate to outcome variables in \nterms of the perceived career capital accrued from assignments. The paper presents a more \nnuanced picture of influence factors on the decision to go and advocates the use of context-\nsensitive, multiple perspectives. Practical implications for multinational organizations are \ndiscussed.  \n   \n \n2 \nWhy do they Go? \n Individual and Corporate Perspectives on the Factors Influencing the Decision to Accept \nan International Assignment \n \nThere is an extensive literature on the use of expatriation and why organizations and individuals \nuse it. The classic corporate motivations have been delineated as knowledge transfer, \nmanagement development, the creation of a common organizational culture and the building of \neffective informal information networks, which result in organizational development (Harzing \nand Van Ruysseveldt, 2004: 259-262). At the individual level, Stahl, Miller and Tung (2002: \n217) argued that relatively little is known about why expatriates accept international work. A \nnumber of authors have pointed out that, with respect to career management, individual and \norganizational needs are not always in total harmony (Vance, 2005; Thomas, Lazarova and \nInkson, 2005, Yan, Hu, and Hall, 2002).   \n \nThe research that has been carried out has identified a range of employee concerns about \ninternational working, including issues with location, work-life balance, financial concerns and \nthe impact of an international assignment (IA) on career and career progression. Much of the \nliterature has concentrated on the willingness to accept international postings (Adler, 1986; Brett \nand Stroh 1995; Tharenou, 2003). Brett and Stroh (1995) and Yurkiewicz and Rosen (1995) \nprovide an overview of factors that affect the willingness to relocate internationally: these \ninclude age, education, race, gender, type of work, career ambition, attitude towards moving, job \ntenure, having a working spouse, having dependants, children at home, community links and \ntenure, openness to change and previous foreign experience. While the literature identifies a \nrange of elements that guide expatriates in their decision to accept an international assignment, \nonly a few studies have focussed on the actual acceptance of international mobility opportunities. \n   \n \n3 \nExisting research does not explore how well employers understand their employees\u201f motivations \nfor international work.  \n \nThis paper presents what is known about the factors that influence the decision of managers to \naccept expatriation, refines the measurement of those influences and explores how closely \naligned are individual and organizational views. The paper uses the empirical evidence to draw \nconclusions for the academic debate and for practitioners. \n \nThe Decision to Go in the Literature \n \nTypical motives for the individual in accepting an international role have been linked to the job \non offer, the opportunity to have new experiences and learning possibilities, personal interest in \ninternational experience, family and domestic issues, the location of the assignment, and the \noverall assignment offer including the repatriation package and the financial impact of working \nabroad (Gregersen, Morrison and Black, 1998; Hammer, Hart and Rogan, 1998; Harvey, 1985; \nMendenhall, 2001; Miller and Cheng, 1978; Stahl et al, 2002; Suutari & Brewster, 2000; Tung, \n1998). Increasingly, authors have proposed the importance of exploring the interplay of \nindividuals and organizations in expatriation as it influences the decisions and behaviours of \nmanagers (Dickmann and Harris, 2005; Larsen, 2004; Vance, 2005; Yan et al., 2002). Key ideas \nwithin these themes are reviewed below.  \n \n   \n \n4 \n \nJob, Development and Career Opportunities in IM \nConsideration by individuals of the impact of foreign work on their own development and likely \ncareer opportunities were a key focus of the expatriation literature (Handler and Lane, 1997; \nMiller and Cheng, 1978; Richardson and Mallon, 2005; Suutari and Brewster, 2000; Tung, 1998; \nYan et al., 2002). For instance, Miller and Cheng (1978) argued that career progression is the key \nmotivator for managers in accepting an international posting. Stahl & Cerdin (2004) found that \nexpatriates appreciated their international experience as an opportunity for personal and \nprofessional development and career advancement, despite dissatisfaction with the lack of long-\nterm planning in the repatriation practices of their organizations. Stahl et al (2002) also attributed \nmajor importance to job, development and career issues as reasons for accepting foreign work.  \nTung\u201fs (1998) data indicated that expatriates value the opportunity to acquire skills and \nexperience usually not available at home and see international work as important for career \ndevelopment.  \n \nLarge multinational organizations see expatriation as a key means to achieving the development \nof global leaders (Harris and Dickmann, 2005). International assignments give expatriates an \nopportunity to improve their intercultural capabilities and general management skills (Gregersen \net al, 1998; Mendenhall, 2001). Career conscious expatriates are increasingly seen to be aware of \nactivities that increase their career capital (Inkson and Arthur, 2001). Networking is an important \npart of the career capital of international assignees and it is likely that the decision to accept \nexpatriation is influenced by consideration of the perceived impact of expatriate work on social \ncapital (Cappellen and Janssens, 2005; Dickmann and Harris, 2005). Harvey, Novicevic and \n   \n \n5 \nGarrison (2005) argue that associability and trust are two productive underlying dimension of \nsocial capital. Social capital benefits the collective directly and an individual indirectly (Leana \nand Van Buren, 1999) in that through associability the individual is willing and able to \nsubordinate his or her goals and associated actions to collective goals and actions. If these \nindividuals are confident of other persons\u201f integrity and reliability they trust them. Trust and \nassociability may be especially important in organizational contexts that are characterised by a \nhigh degree of informality which encourage individuals to focus strongly on building their social \ncapital (Dickmann and Harris, 2005). The influence that opportunities to extend the social capital \nof expatriates has on their decision to go abroad has been relatively neglected (Brett and Stroh, \n1995; Fish and Wood, 1997; Stahl et al., 2002; Yurkiewicz and Rosen, 1995).   \n \nPersonal and Domestic Issues in IM \nThe concept of boundaryless careers, in which the work experiences of individuals transcend \norganizations and jobs (DeFillippi and Arthur, 1996), has recently become more prevalent (Eby, \nButts and Lockwood, 2003). The protean career concept (Hall, 1976, 1996) raises the profile of \npersonal goals in how individual\u201fs decide to pursue work and career. The person\u201fs own values \nand needs become the driving forces (Yan et al., 2002). The literature outlines the importance of \npersonal interests in developing international experience to accepting work overseas (Miller and \nCheng, 1978; Tung, 1998). Suutari and Brewster (2000) found a significant attitudinal difference \nbetween traditional company expatriates and self-initiated foreign workers\u201f interest in \ninternationalism. Moreover, Inkson, Arthur, Pringle and Barry (1997) argued that many young \nAustralians and New Zealanders seek adventure and go overseas for reasons of travel, work and \ntourism. These motives are supported by research from Richardson and Mallon (2005) who \n   \n \n6 \nexplored the reasons academics accept work overseas. Their findings indicated that many are \nguided by motives such as an individual desire for adventure, travel and life change.  \n \nThere is an increasing body of knowledge that deals with issues beyond the direct job, \ndevelopment and career factors that impact international mobility. Harvey has long been active \nin researching the impact of family and spouses on expatriation (Harvey, 1985; 1995). The study \nfocusing on German expatriates by Stahl, Miller and Tung (2002) presented data on how \nimportant family or spouse-related motives are in accepting international assignments. The \nliterature provides extensive coverage on the issues of expatriate couples and dual careers (Brett \nand Stroh, 1995; Falkenberg and Monachello, 1990; Linehan and Walsh, 2000). Overall, these \nworks suggest that to ensure a successful assignment the willingness of both partners to relocate \nshould be taken into account and the family should be supported by broad, company-sponsored \nhelp mechanisms before, during and after the assignment (Harvey, 1985; Sparrow, Brewster and \nHarris, 2004).  \n \nIntimately linked to family and spouse considerations is the balance between work and non-work \nactivities. Wider work-life considerations are important since they are amongst the problems \nmost often mentioned in international mobility and traditional expatriation (Fenwick, 2001). \nUnfortunately, this area is not explored sufficiently by the research focussing on the motives that \nguide managers to accept an expatriate post (Brett and Stroh, 1995; Fish and Wood, 1997; Stahl \net al., 2002). Thus, it is important to explore personal and non-work related influence factors on \nthe decision to accept international work. \n \n   \n \n7 \nLocation Factors \nThe difference between home country and destination country has led to much research \nexploring cultural distances and processes, times and methods and how expatriates adjust \nemotionally and intellectually to the new environment (Black, Gregersen and Mendenhall, 1992; \nBhaskar-Shrinivas, Shaffer and Luk, 2005; Haslberger, 2005; Spony, 2003; Tung, 1998). \nGenerally, this research highlights the importance of companies\u201f international mobility policies \nand practices (such as pre-departure preparation), host culture, language compatibility, distance \nfrom home country and personal security, to potential expatriates. Yurkiewicz and Rosen (1995) \nfound that location factors can be greater barriers to accepting expatriation than financial or \ncareer considerations. But the degree of importance of location factors is far from clear. For \ninstance, Stahl et al (2002) found that their respondents only attributed a moderate influence to \ngeographic location on accepting expatriation. Moreover, because authors tend to ask \nparticipants to rank items (Stahl et al., 2002; Yurkiewicz and Rosen, 1995) it is impossible to \nquantify the differences in importance between items.  \n \nAssignment Offer \nMonetary consideration are seen by the writers in the field as important to expatriates (Miller and \nCheng, 1978; Yurkiewicz and Rosen, 1995). However, Stahl et al. (2002) argued that the \nimportance of financial packages has been overstressed and that studies have mainly \nconcentrated on American expatriates. Instead, the authors argued that the strength of this motive \nmay vary according to the nationality of the sample. Only 50 percent of their German sample put \nthis motive as one of the five most important reasons for accepting an international assignment.  \nFish and Wood (1997) also argued that among their sample of Australian managers, the \n   \n \n8 \nmotivation to undertake expatriation was linked more to personally desired intrinsic outcomes \nthan to immediate extrinsic gratification.  \n \nMoreover, the assignment offer may consist of more than financial compensation. It is likely that \nexpatriates take the whole package, through to repatriation, into account. There is increasing \nevidence that repatriation is amongst the most difficult international mobility issues for \norganizations to manage and that expatriates are relatively discontent with the policies and \npractices of their corporations (Stahl and Cerdin, 2004; Sparrow et al., 2004). Yurkiewicz and \nRosen (1995) found that a written guarantee of a position upon completion was seen as an \nincentive to accept an overseas posting for four out of five of their respondents. It is likely, \ntherefore, that longer-term considerations such as repatriation offers will have an influence on \nthe individuals decision to accept a foreign posting.  \n \nA broader perspective on the Decision to Go \nIn order to summarise this literature, we note that individuals consider a wide range of factors in \ndeciding whether or not to accept an international assignment offer. However Vance (2005: 375) \nlamented that the international management literature has neglected to explore how individuals \nstrive to obtain developmental foreign work experiences. He juxtaposed this with the increasing \nattention paid to the individual\u201fs own career management. Thus there are still some areas where \nresearch gaps exist including the impact of family consideration, the importance of financial \nincentives, individual perceptions on the career capital they expect to gain and the direct career \nimpact upon repatriation on the individual decision to go. Although we now have considerable \ndata about both individual and organizational perspectives on expatriation and repatriation these \n   \n \n9 \nhave largely been researched independently. Since those individuals who chose to take up \ninternational assignments within an organizational context constitute a large and increasing \npopulation there is a significant gap in research on organizational context, such as managerial \nperspectives on individual decision making. Thomas, Lazarova and Inkson (2005: 345) argued \nthat research must \u201efocus much more clearly on the relationship between the global career actor \nand organizations\u201f. Also Larsen (2004) reiterated the need for global careers to be viewed as a \ndynamic dual dependency between organization and individual. The literature indicates clearly \nthat the assessment of motives that guide the decision of individuals when they are considering \ntaking an assignment abroad can be extended and refined.  \n \nFirst, it would be beneficial to include a broader career capital perspective. Thus, factors such as \nconsiderations of work\/life balance and the individuals\u201f perception of whether expatriation is \nlikely to build their social capital should be incorporated. Second, there is an opportunity to \nmove beyond the ranking of influence factors towards a measurement that allows a first insight \ninto the differences in the relative weighting of those motives. In addition, we argue that it is \nimportant to understand the organizational perspective. The extent to which employers are aware \nof the relative importance of their expatriates\u201f motives is likely to shape their international work \nstrategies, policies and practices. This in turn has an effect on the perceptions and expectations of \ntheir international assignees. Contrasting expatriates\u201f motivations to accept foreign work with \ntheir organizations\u201f assessment of what drives these international workers will extend our \nunderstanding of the dynamic dual dependency alluded to by Larsen (2004).  \n \nThis research therefore addressed the following questions: \n   \n \n10 \n What are the key influence factors on the decision of expatriates to accept international \nwork? \n How important are these influences for individuals? \n How do organizational representatives view the importance of these influences on individual \nemployees\u201f decision to accept international work?  \n How closely aligned are the views of individual assignees with their organizational \nrepresentatives? \n \nMETHODOLOGY \nThis study employed both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Rousseau & Fried (2001) \nargued for the more widespread use of contextualization. Due to the increasing \ninternationalization of organizational research and the rapidly diversifying nature of employee-\norganizational relations, context is an essential variable in understanding research outcomes. The \nqualitative research focussed on a single organizational context. This allowed the researchers to \ncontrol for context in the confirmation and exploration of the factors important to the decision to \naccept an IA. A survey incorporating the factors highlighted by the qualitative research was \ndesigned to access a wider audience of individuals and organizational representatives. \n \n \nQualitative Interviews \nThe case company was a major financial services organization. The group head office is in the \nUK, with a workforce of over 200,000 people and extensive global reach. The organization has \ngrown organically and through acquisition. Internationalisation has been an established strategy \nfor both extending operational and market reach and as a development tool for executive career \n   \n \n11 \nprogression. This company has an enduring tradition and established exemplary reputation for its \nexpatriation strategy, policy and practice. It adopts a traditional approach to career development \nwhich is positioned as a key element of the expatriation experience. The research was carried out \nin close cooperation with the HR department.  \n \nThe qualitative stage of this research was designed to be both confirmatory and exploratory. \nBased on a review of the literature a number of a priori assumptions guided the qualitative \ninterviews which included the organizational career philosophy, strategy, policy and practice, \nperceived factors influencing the take up of IA and repatriation practices. Repatriates were also \nasked to reflect on the IA experience in terms of the career capital impact, perceived career \noutcomes and their use of acquired skills on return. (Examples of interview questions are \nincluded at Appendix A). \n \nNon-probability sampling (Reynolds, Simintiras and Diamantopoulos, 2003) was used to \npurposefully select cases from the organizational database of international assignees. The \ninterviewees had returned from assignment between 1998 and 2004, providing a range of \nindividuals with varying lengths of return which allowed the exploration of repatriation \nexperiences. The sampling frame incorporated criteria such as gender, personal circumstances on \nassignment, managerial level and function within the organization. The sample included both UK \nand Asia Pacific based personnel who had been seconded to a range of locations across the \nglobe. A total of 30 interviews were conducted. Two senior managers responsible for strategy, \npolicy and implementation of IAs secondments provided in-depth information (including \ndocumentation) on the organizational rationale for IAs. Twenty eight interviewees were \n   \n \n12 \nrepatriates who returned to and had remained within the organization. The majority of \ninterviewees were male (n= 21) and holding senior positions (n=19). Individuals held a range of \nfunctional roles across retail, corporate and IT. Length of international experience ranged \nbetween 1 and 7 years. Thus, this sample of interviewees afforded the opportunity to explore a \nbreadth of IA, repatriation and post repatriation experiences, within this particular organizational \ncontext.  \n \nA combination of face-to face in-depth interviews by the authors and one-to-one in-depth \ntelephone interviews were conducted between November 2004 and June 2005. The interviews \nwere taped and transcribed. Through an iterative process of analysis and review, the data were \nstructured by recurrent patterns and organized into analytical themes. A qualitative data analysis \npackage (NVivo) was used to facilitate this process and to assist in extracting pertinent \nreferences and comments direct from interviewees (as outlined in italics below). The data within \neach theme were quantified for frequency of occurrence and positive or negative inference. This \nqualitative exploration of the individual experiences of IA, repatriation and post repatriation \nroles within a known organizational context provided substantial data to build a picture of the \nissues perceived as pertinent to the individual decision to go. Additionally the data about the \norganizational philosophy, the assignment offer and the management of the repatriation process \nprovided perspective which helped to qualify and contextualise the responses from individuals. \n \nQuantitative Survey \nTwo questionnaires were designed, one for international assignees to complete and one for HR \nmanagers. Each questionnaire format contained a number of identical questions in order to \n   \n \n13 \nenable comparison between the groups. Other questions related specifically to each target \npopulation. \n \nThe item pool for polling individual and organizational representatives\u201f perceptions of the \nfactors influencing the decision were constructed by subject matter experts based on the \nacademic literature, the qualitative interview data and experienced practitioners in the field. An \nitem pool was generated and selection of items was based on triangulation between the experts. \nThis method ensured that a comprehensive range of the factors that might impact decision-\nmaking were included. Twenty-eight items were selected which provided comprehensive \ncoverage of the range of factors highlighted by the literature, for example job and career issues, \nfamily issues, personal motivations, expatriation package and repatriation (see Table 1).  \n-------------------------------------------- \nINSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n---------------------------------------------- \nScale anchors were generated by reference to survey item bank (British Telecom, 1981) that \nprovided a number of tested scale formats. Following piloting of options, a 7-point scale was \nchosen, which included No influence, Little influence, Mild influence, Moderate influence, \nConsiderable influence, Great influence, and Very great influence. \n \nEach questionnaire contained a question relating to the decision to accept an assignment \nfollowed by the 28 factors. HR managers were asked: How much influence do you believe the \nfollowing factors have on your assignees' decision to accept an international assignment? \n   \n \n14 \nAssignees were asked: How much influence do the following factors have on your decision to \naccept an international assignment?  \n \nA range of items regarding the perceived impact of the IA on the individual\u201fs career capital and \ncareer progression, as proxy items for the outcome of the IA were included. For example \nindividual respondents were asked to rate on a five point scale the perceived impact (little or no \nimpact to very great impact) of the assignment on building career relevant networks, developing \ncapabilities and building motivation. Scales was also developed to ascertain the type of role \noffered post-assignment (promoted role, lateral role or demoted role) and the extent to which the \nindividual perceived the IA to improve career prospects (on a 5 point Likert scale: no extent to \nvery great extent).  \n \nA full pilot questionnaire was designed for each group (HR, corporate representatives and \nindividuals). Pilot questionnaires were then sent to a sample of the target population. Responses \nwere analysed and feedback was obtained through follow-up telephone interviews and feedback \nemails. Some small amendments were made to the questionnaires to provide the final versions to \nbe used in the study. \n \nThe final questionnaires were placed on the web. Potential participants were identified by contact \nwith 15 multi-national companies that had previously agreed to take part in the research. \nParticipants were invited to complete the questionnaires via emails with a link to the relevant \nweb site. Participants were asked to complete the questionnaire by a specified date. As this date \napproached reminder emails were sent to those who had not responded.  \n   \n \n15 \n \nIndividuals were instructed to refer to their most recent assignment and asked how much \ninfluence a list of 28 items had on their decision to accept their assignment. In contrast, the HR \nmanagers in charge of international mobility programmes, in the 15 companies were asked how \nmuch influence the same 28 items had on their assignees\u201f decision to accept their assignments.  \n \nA total of 310 responses were obtained for the individual survey and there were responses from \n49 HR managers (the \u201ccorporate survey\u201d below). Of the individual respondents 27% were from \nthe IT sector, a further 27% from financial and professional services and 15% from food and \ndrinks companies. 35 respondents, (11.5% of the individual sample) were female. The median \nage of the respondents to the individual survey was 40 years, the youngest being 26 and the \noldest 63. Almost 84% of the sample were married or living with a partner. 26% were \nunaccompanied on their assignment. The mean number of dependants was 2 and 56% on \nrespondents had been on one or two assignments. These figures are similar to those in other \nsurveys of expatriates. \n \nData gathered from the individual survey were analysed to provide descriptive statistics of \nresponses to each decision item. Table 2 (below) shows the mean response achieved for each \nitem along with the number of responses and the standard deviation. Results for useable \nresponses are presented in order of influence, from most influential to least. Table 3 (below, page \n19) indicates the views of the HR specialists responsible for the corporate expatriation policies. \nTable 4 (below, page 22) presents significant differences between individual and organizational \nassessments of the importance of factors for the decision to go. \n   \n \n16 \n \nFINDINGS: ASSESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF FACTORS INFLUENCING THE \nDECISION TO ACCEPT AN INTERNATIONAL ASSIGNMENT \n \nThis section presents the findings of the survey, integrating data from the qualitative interviews \nto illustrate key issues. Table 2 both reinforces some of the previous wisdom whilst challenging \nother aspects of it. It shows that position offered on assignment was rated as the most influential \nfactor by assignees when deciding whether to accept an assignment. Distance away from home \nlocation was perceived as the least influential factor. All categories of location factors, job, \ndevelopment and career opportunities, personal and domestic considerations and assignment \noffer are shown to be important to individuals.  \n \n-------------------------------------------- \nINSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \n---------------------------------------------- \n \n \n \n \nJob, Development and Career Opportunities \nThe qualitative study indicated that the expatriation deal is positioned as \u201ccareer enhancing for \nthe individual\u201d (Male, Senior Management). Within the case organization, individuals endorsed \nthis view of the career benefits of expatriation. In the short term, the assignment job offered was \n   \n \n17 \nseen as a major influence factor. One respondent commented \u201cI look at the scope and content of \nthe job\u201d (Male, Senior Management, Asia). In the longer term \u201dthe promotion \nopportunity\u201d(Male, Middle Management, Asia) was an important factor in the decision to accept \noverseas work as was the opportunity to develop leadership skills \u201cif you are going to get to the \ntop then you need to have international exposure within the organization\u201d (Male, Senior \nManagement, UK).  \n \nThe survey data confirmed job, career and development factors as the key factors in the decision \nto work abroad (as found in previous work such as Stahl et al., 2002; Tung, 1998; Yurkiewicz \nand Rosen, 1995). Items relating to these issues were ranked 1\nst\n, 3\nrd\n, 4\nth\n, 6\nth\n, 7\nth\n and 8\nth\n  rated out \nof 28 items.  \n \nAssociability and trust are two underlying dimension of social capital (Harvey et al., 2005). \nDickmann and Harris (2005) described an organization characterized by informal networks being \nimportant for international career advancement. Being known and trusted by powerful people in \ntheir home base was seen as a successful way to manage one\u201fs career. Moreover, international \nassignees acquire more know how. For example, gaining international business acumen and \npracticing their leadership skills was perceived to have an impact on their ability to acquire better \nsocial networks (cf. Inkson and Arthur, 2001; Harris and Dickmann, 2005). Previous work has \nindicated that the social capital strategies of individuals are influenced by organizational \nstructures and policies (Dickmann and Doherty, in submission). This survey showed that \nindividuals ranked (25\nth\n) the item maintaining work networks with the home country as less \ninfluential than many other factors, in their decision to work abroad. \n   \n \n18 \n \nOverall, the \u201ccorporate survey\u201d rankings are different from those of the individuals, clearly \ntaking less account of the professional challenge and skills development aspects involved. These \ndifferences are explored in more depth below. \n \nPersonal and Domestic Considerations \nFamily concerns, especially educational issues and the care for elderly relatives were seen as \nimportant in guiding their decision to accept expatriation by 19 of the 28 interviewees in the \nqualitative leg. \u201cI need to consider my daughter\u2019s education and my parents are getting old and \nI need to care for my old parents (Male, Middle Management, Asia). Disruption to family life \nand work-life balance issues were considered important by both individuals and organizational \nrepresentatives in the interviews. Rather than a barrier to international mobility, several \ninterviewees gave educational and family reasons as a motivator to go abroad. This impression \nof importance was supported by the survey, in which two of the five most important factors for \nindividuals were family related \u2013 willingness of the spouse to move and children\u2019s educational \nneeds. Our results support the work of others who found that family related factors were \nimportant to the decision to go (Harvey, 1985; 1995; Sparrow et al., 2004).  \n \nThe personal desire to have experience working abroad was considered highly motivating, for \nexample \u201c It had been a long held ambition for me that I wanted to get some international \nexperience and I wanted to work overseas, so as soon as the opportunity presented itself, I \njumped at it\u2026\u201d (Female, Senior Management, UK).   \n \n   \n \n19 \nThe desire to have a personally acceptable distribution between private and professional lives in \nthe work-life balance equation is likely to be reflected in the considerations to accept foreign \nwork (Baruch, 2004; Schein, 1990). A quarter (7) of interviewees referred to changes of general \nwork\/life balance that could present a barrier to go. \u201cFor me personally I have always tried to \nmaintain some kind of balance between my private life and my business life.  I am not prepared \nto completely sacrifice one for the other.  I don\u2019t think you can be completely happy in one, if \nyou are not in the other.\u201d  (Male, Top Management, UK). The item \u201cwork\/life balance\u201d was \nmiddle ranked by the individuals in the survey \n \nThe length of assignment has a sizeable influence on expatriates\u201f decisions, being in the top half \nof the rankings. The direction of the effect is likely to depend on individual preferences and \norganizational context (Dickmann and Harris, 2005). Maintaining personal networks was ranked \nrelatively low in the survey (22\nnd\n). \n \nWhile the corporate rankings show many similarities with those of the individuals, they differed \nsignificantly with respect to the importance of work\/life balance considerations and the \ninterruption in the spouse\u201fs career.  \n-------------------------------------------- \nINSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE \n---------------------------------------------- \n \n \n \n   \n \n20 \nAssignment Offer \nThis research is equivocal about the impression that financial considerations are primary drivers \nin the decision to accept expatriation (Miller and Cheng, 1978; Yurkiewicz and Rosen, 1995). \nWhereas personal financial circumstances were ranked 8\nth\n by the individuals (and 5\nth\n by the \ncorporate respondents), the repatriation package itself was rated as a substantially lesser issue in \nboth surveys. In the interviews, most individuals regarded the developmental and career benefits \nas overwhelming. About half of the interviewees also indicated that working abroad involved \n\u201csome financial incentive\u201d (Male, Senior HR, UK).  For some, finance appeared to be more of a \nhygiene factor in terms of the influence on the decision to accept. \u201cCertainly, at the time it \n(finance) was not a consideration for me.\u201d  (Female, Senior Management, UK). \n \nInterviewees tended to regard the perceived insecurity about their future post as a barrier to \ntaking an assignment. They commented: \u201cI think you are always concerned about where you are \ngoing to come back to\u201d (Female, Middle Management, UK). \n \nFrom the survey the post-assignment role was seen as important. It was rated in the top half of all \nfactors in both the individual and the corporate surveys. Individual and corporate rankings were \noften close in this category with the marked exception of the importance of personal financial \nimpact. This difference will be explored in more depth below.  \n \nLocation Factors \nThe host location, including adapting to the different cultures, was mentioned as influential by \nover half of the interviewees and is indicated in several items in the survey: for example, security \n   \n \n21 \nwas the 9\nth\n highest rated factor in the decision. This is a concern reflected in the interviews : \u201cI \ndon\u2019t want to go overseas just for the heck of it, and there are lots of places I do not want to go \nto. So I think, for the majority of people, location is a key consideration.\u201d (Male, Top \nManagement, UK). \n \nOther location factors that influenced the decision to accept an international assignment offer \nincluded the living conditions in the country, perception of the cultural difference of the host \nnation and language. However, each of these items was rated in the bottom half of the list of \nfactors by the survey participants. Overall, the ratings from the corporate survey show similar \nrankings to those from the individual survey in terms of location factors. \n \nExploring the differences between individual and organizational perspectives \nSince our survey asked for rating on each item rather than for rankings, we are in a good position \nto compare the weightings given by corporate and individual respondents (changes in the \nweighting of one item will not affect the weighting of others). In order to assess more closely the \nsystematic differences between the individual and corporate survey responses across all the \nfactors, a series of T-tests were carried out. Table 4 presents the results of these analyses and \nhighlights those factors that are rated significantly differently by the individual and corporate \nparticipants. In each case the level of significance and the group which rated the factor most \ninfluential is given. \n-------------------------------------------- \nINSERT TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE \n---------------------------------------------- \n   \n \n22 \nFrom Table 4 above it can be noted that corporate responses are close to the rankings of the \nindividuals. However, corporate respondents appear to underestimate the influence that some of \nthe factors have on assignees\u201f decision making when choosing whether or not to accept an \nassignment. Individuals regarded predominantly developmental and job-related aspects as \nsignificantly more important than companies at the decision stage. Thus, leadership skills \ndevelopment, professional challenge, having job-related skills and general skills development \nwere all significantly more important for expatriates than for their employers. This finding, \ncombined with their relative importance in the ranking, supports the literature on the changing \nnature of careers (Baruch, 2004; Hall and Chandler, 2005). Cultural adaptation may point to the \nperceived greater need of individuals to go to a location where they feel they can adapt and \nunderstand the customs and culture and interact with locals in a meaningful way (Haslberger, \n1999). Finally, an adequate balance between personal and professional life influences the \ndecisions of expatriates to go more than is appreciated by organizations.  \n \nIn turn, the organizational representatives placed significantly more importance than the \nmanagers on location (distance); and successful previous assignments. Moreover, corporate \nrespondents overestimate the influence of the disruption to a spouse's career and the \naccompanying loss of income. However, this is likely to be mediated by the type of career a \nspouse may have. Some evidence of this is apparent in the high Standard Deviation for these \nitems seen in Table 2. This suggests that for some people such disruption would be very \ninfluential.  \n \n   \n \n23 \nCorporate respondents also appear to overestimate the influence of the financial impact, possibly \nbecause much other research outlines that the financial conditions of expatriation are important \nto assignees (Yurkiewicz and Rosen, 1995) and that many international workers are dissatisfied \nwith their compensation and benefit packages (Stahl and Cerdin, 2004). Our data indicate that \nalthough financial issues are important to individuals at the point they decide to accept an \noverseas posting they are not as important for their decision as corporations expect them to be, a \nfinding that is broadly in line with Fish and Wood\u201fs (1997) data on repatriates.  \n \nCurrently the literature suggests that organizations use few formal tracking mechanisms to \nfollow-up the career progression of repatriates, but we do know that subjective impressions of \nrepatriates paint a somewhat bleak picture of the perceived career consequences of taking an \ninternational assignment. We included a number of items in this survey as proxy outcome \nmeasures of the perceived impact of the international assignment. These included questions \ntapping the perceived career capital gained from the assignment; type of role offered and \nperceived impact on career prospects and career progression.  \n \nFor those items where there were significant differences (p<.01) between corporate and \nindividual respondents ratings of the factors, a series of correlations with the proxy outcome \nfactors (career capital impact and career progression) were carried out (see Table 5 below). \n\u201eHaving relevant job related skills\u201f and \u201ePotential for leadership skills development\u201f (R=.194, \nR=.187 respectively) both correlate with perceptions of a positive impact on the development of \nsocial capital (building career relevant networks and sources of information). Where individuals \nperceive \u201eHaving relevant job related skills\u201f and \u201ePotential for leadership skills development\u201f as \n   \n \n24 \nimportant influential factors in the decision to go there is a greater perceived impact of the \nassignment on their social capital (knowing whom). \n \n-------------------------------------------- \nINSERT TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE \n---------------------------------------------- \n \nThe analysis also revealed that the influence factors \u201ePotential for job skills development\u201f and \n\u201ePotential for leadership skills development\u201f, correlated positively (R=.387 and R=.316 \nrespectively) with positive perceptions of impact on capability development (developing \ncapabilities, work related skills, expertise and experience). Thus, where individuals indicated a \nhigh level of influence of these factors on their decision to go they also indicated a positive \nimpact on their skills development (knowing how) as an outcome of the IA. \n \nThe higher the perceived influence of \u201ePotential for job skills development\u201f, \u201ePotential for \nleadership skills development\u201f, \u201eProfessional challenge of working abroad\u201f and \u201eSuccessful \nprevious assignment\u201f the greater the perceived impact of the assignment on individual \nmotivation building (personal beliefs, values and sense of purpose) (respectively R=.205, \nR=.257, R=.182 and R=.175). Where individuals indicated that the potential for skills and \nleadership development, professional challenge and successful previous assignment were highly \ninfluential in the decision to go, they reported a perceived significant impact on their motivation \n(knowing why).  \n \n   \n \n25 \nAnother important finding was a significant correlation between the influence factor of \u201ePotential \nfor leadership skills development\u201f (R=.119) with perceived improved career prospects outside \nthe organisation. Where individuals attributed more influence to this factor in their decision \nmaking they perceived better prospects. In addition the item \u201ePotential for leadership \ndevelopment\u201f correlates significantly with type of role post assignment (R=.152) (scale inverted: \ndemotion, lateral, promotion), indicating the where this item was attributed more influence in the \ndecision to go, the individual was more likely to achieve a post assignment promotion.  \n \nSignificant differences were found between individual and corporate respondents on two items \nrelating to the importance of loss of partner\u201fs income and interruption to career. These items \nwere relevant to a sub-set of the total population of individual respondents and one item \u201eloss of \npartner\u201fs income\u201f was significantly correlated with role offered post assignment; those more \nconcerned with loss of income were more likely to achieve promotion on return (R=.146). \nAlthough it unclear what may lie behind this relationship, it was considered likely that age may \nbe a confounding variable. To test this, a partial correlation in which age was controlled for was \ncarried out. This analysis showed that once age had been controlled for there was no significant \ncorrelation between the two variables. Therefore it may be that a combination of issues such as \nage-career stage and dual career concerns are at play to underpin this association. \n \nThere has been little in previous research to explore the impact of the factors influencing the \ndecision to undertake an expatriate assignment on outcomes. This study exposes some of the \npotential interactions between what motivates individuals and the perceived career impacts of \nsuch an experience. Our findings indicate that the potential for individual career capital \n   \n \n26 \n(knowing) development is strongly related to some of their initial motivations to take up an \nassignment. In particular individuals who are strongly motivated by the potential to develop their \nskills and in particular their leadership skills appear to believe that they profit from an IA not \nonly in terms of enhanced capabilities, networks and motivations but also in their internal \npromotion and perceived external career progression prospects.  \n \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nThe qualitative part of the research set out to explore a range of factors collated from as review \nof the literature which were key influence factors for expatriates to accept an expatriation offer. \nBy studying these issues within a known organizational context, we were able to understand the \nimpact of context on the individual. The influence factors concerned the areas of location, job, \ndevelopment and career opportunities, personal and domestic factors and assignment offer \nconsiderations. While these motives had been identified in the literature before (Adler, 1986; \nMiller and Cheng, 1978;Yurkiewicz and Rosen, 1995) further considerations which had been \nrelatively neglected in previous research items such as work-life balance issues, length of \nassignment considerations and broad security concerns were identified as important in the \ndecision to go. \n \nThe results of 310 survey responses from individuals support the importance of job, development \nand career considerations. However, the data also challenged the predominant argument that \nfinancial considerations are a primary motive for expatriates and, instead, points to the \n   \n \n27 \nimportance of development and family considerations. The research also indicated that security, \nlength of assignment and work-life balance issues have a considerable influence on the decision \nof individuals to accept expatriation. Thus, these data support the notion that individuals conduct \ncomplex assessments upon accepting international assignments and that often these assessments \nare guided by intrinsic, Protean career considerations (Hall, 1976).  \n \nIn response to the many writers who call for the exploration of the individual and organizational \nperspectives in international careers and expatriation (Larsen, 2004; Vance, 2005; Yan et al., \n2002) the research explored the degree of alignment between organizational representatives\u201f \nperceptions and employee motivations to accept overseas work. In so doing it refined the \nmeasures of influences on the decision to go and extended the research scope. Looking at \norganizational and individual responses to the same list of factors allowed an exploration of the \ndual dependency of expatriation decision making. Our research highlighted substantial \ndifferences between individuals\u201f and their employers\u201f perceptions of the drivers and barriers to \naccepting international work. Such differences in opinion may fundamentally impact on the \nperceived \u201esuccess\u201f of an international assignment, for example the relative importance of the \ndevelopmental aspects attributed by individuals may set different expectations and therefore \ndiverse views of the outcomes between individuals and their employers. The implication is that \nresearch in this field of career management needs diverse methodologies and multiple \nperspectives to gain a balanced and refined view that takes account of the mutual dependency \nthat actors experience (Larsen, 2004).  \n \n   \n \n28 \nThe findings show that the corporate HR specialists have a shrewd view of the importance of \nmost issues to employees. However, there are some significant differences. For instance, while \norganizations overestimate the impact of prior experience with assignments, financial and family \nconsiderations, they underestimate cultural adaptability factors, developmental issues and work-\nlife considerations.  \n \nThis study takes a step further than previous work on expatriation by exploring the impact of the \ninfluencing factors on the decision to go on perceived outcomes for the individual expatriate. \nThe schism between individual and organizational views on the factors that are important to the \ndecision to go may have more fundamental implications than just a \u201edifference of opinion\u201f. \nWhere individuals attributed factors significantly more influence on their decision to go than \nsignalled by corporate representatives, there were significant relationships with perceptions of \noutcome. The perceived potential for development embodied in an IA had a significant \nassociation with the perceived career capital impact. Thus, those individuals who are concerned \nwith the developmental aspects of an IA appear to regard the assignment as a positive \nopportunity. Having relevant job related skills and having had a previous successful assignment \nwere also significantly related to career capital outcomes potentially indicating that confidence in \nthe perceived ability to fulfil the assignment role is important to potential assignees. Achieving \nclarity about the purpose of the assignment is an area that still lacks adequate research and good \npractice. In addition, those individuals for whom \u201epotential for leadership development\u201f is a key \ndecision factor appear to benefit from an IA not only in terms of positive outcomes across the \ncareer capital areas but also in terms of promotion on return and enhanced career prospects \n   \n \n29 \noutside the organization, a continuing concern for companies where attrition of expatriate talent \nis high. \n \nFor practitioners within organizations, one of the messages from the research is that \nunderstanding individual motivations and harnessing them will become an increasingly \nimportant aspect of successful international assignment management. The research covered the \nrelevance of a wide range of factors in making the decision to go on assignment. It emerged that \norganizations were more focused on the financial package to encourage a positive decision to go \nbut that individuals increasingly undertake a complex assessment that includes development, \ncareer and live-style factors. One added value of this research has been to attempt to tease out the \npotential implications of a difference between an individual and an organizational assessment of \nthe factors considered important to the decision to expatriate. This paper exposed some potential \ndilemmas which could arise from mismatched perceptions of the expatriation experience within a \ndual dependency mode. Not only do individual consider some factors to be significantly more \nimportant to their decision to go than perceived by company representatives, but these factors \nappear to have significant relationships with outcomes. The danger of companies understating \nthese factors in policy and practice would be a potentially negative impact on the very \nindividuals who appear to get the most out of an IA. A one-size-fits-all approach to dealing with \nexpatriation policies and practices may increasingly harbour risks.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n30 \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nThis research highlighted significant differences between employees and their employers in the \nassessment of the factors driving the decision to accept an international assignment. \n \nThis is one of the first studies to attempt to identify in detail the full range of factors that \nindividuals take into account when they take the decision to accept an assignment abroad, and to \ncompare the weightings that they give those assignments with the weightings given by the HR \nspecialists in their organisations. Nevertheless, there are a number of aspects of the current \nresearch which would benefit from improvement.  \n \nThe qualitative research concentrated on one organizational context. Although this could lead to \nbias, in-depth knowledge of the context facilitated an fuller understanding of the responses. The \nkey gap in current research concerns the lack of work which explores individual and \norganizational views as a two sides of the same coin. Thus, the survey methodology enabled us \nto begin to tease out some of the different perceptions of individuals and organizations. Future \nresearch may usefully explore a variety of specific company contexts, for instance, the formal \nexpatriation policies as well as the informal perceptions of the \u201evalue\u201f of international \nassignments for long-term careers, in more depth. Moreover, exploring the goals of individual \nexpatriates and linking them to outcomes, ideally with sensitivity to the temporal dimension, \nwould be an exciting research avenue. In order to extend the current research a larger sample and \ngreater range of organizations would be beneficial. In particular a range of organisations \nheadquartered in different countries, and comparison of views in real time would be valuable. \n \n   \n \n31 \n \n \n   \n \n32 \nReferences:  \n \nAdler, N. 1986.
