Resolution issues have been systematically studied as a function of emission current\nand working distance, by imaging single pixel lines FIB milled into thin bismuth films deposited on\noxidized silicon. The ion beam profile has been measured, and by carefully optimizing the milling\nconditions, 40 nm Hall probe sensors have been fabricated. \u00a9 2005 American Institute of\nPhysics. [DOI: 10.1063\/1.1844431]\nFIB milling has proven to be a very powerful tool to\nfabricate nanoscale structures. It is used in the development\nof nanoelectronics,1 nanoscale probe recording,2 and\nmagnetoelectronics,3 or for high resolution modification of\nMFM tips.4 We have recently demonstrated the ability of the\nFIB technique to fabricate 50 nm wide Hall effect sensors.5\nThe main advantage of FIB is that it is a very rapid, dry\ntechnique, as compared to electron beam lithography for in-\nstance. FIB patterning consists of exposing the target to a\nhigh energy focused ion beam in order to sputter away the\ntarget material. The resolution which can be reached using\nthis technique first depends on the selected aperture size\nwhich defines the ion current2 and on the target material (the\nlateral damage and sputtering yield induced by the ion beam\ndepend on the target composition, as can be estimated from\nTRIM calculations).6 However, for a given ion aperture and\ntarget we show that it is possible to greatly improve the\nresolution offered by standard commercial systems by reduc-\ning the emission current (EC) and working distance (WD).\nMeasuring the focusing properties of an ion beam can be\ndone by several ways, such as using a Faraday cup of known\ndimensions and a deconvolution procedure,7 although the\nspatial resolution of this technique is limited, or by exposing\na target to the ion beam and measuring the damage done\nto it.8\u201310 We have chosen the second method: a 50 nm\nthick Bi film is first deposited by thermal evaporation\ns1 \u00c5\/s ,10\u22126 mbarsd on thermally oxidized silicon substrates;\nFIB milling is then performed using the 1 pA aperture of an\nFEI 200xP\u00ae FIB workstation (Ga+ LMIS operated at\n30 keV) and resolution tests are carried out by milling single\npixel lines. For milling these 1D structures, the ion beam is\nrastered along a line (dwell time 1 ms, overlap 50%, magni-\nfication 3200k), as many times as is needed to achieve the\nrequired dose. Figure 1 shows two SEM pictures of these\nstructures. The widths of the lines have been measured using\nimage analysis software: the gray level value has been aver-\naged over the height of the picture, and the width at half\nmaximum has been retained. Bi has originally been used\nbecause we are interested in fabricating nanoscale Hall\nsensors.\n5 Additionally, however, the large difference between\nthe atomic number of Bi and the mean atomic number of\nSiO2 causes the SEM contrast between the cleared substrate\nand the Bi film to be excellent.\nIn our FIB system, the ion beam is produced by extract-\ning ions from a LMIS by applying a high voltage relative to\nthe source to a nearby electrode. The total ion current ex-\ntracted from the source is the EC, and is of the order of few\nmA. Ion beams produced at ever higher EC are known to be\ncomposed of an ever increasing proportion of dimers, trim-\ners, and charged clusters.11 At low EC, reducing the EC re-\nduces the width of the energy distribution of the beam,11,12\nand therefore improves the performance of a given source by\nreducing the effect of chromatic aberration in the optical sys-\ntem. We have measured the effect of reducing the EC below\nthe default value set for basic FIB use s2.2 mAd, and have\nindeed found that reducing it to 1 mA improves the resolu-\ntion by 20%. The rest of the experiments have therefore been\nperformed using this low value.\nFIB systems are known to have a large depth of focus,13\nand this property is used implicitly in commercial systems\nwhere all the settings for the focusing lenses are optimized\nfor a particular stage height, called the eucentric height. It\nwill be referred to thereafter as normal working distance\n(NWD). However, reducing the WD should increase the\nresolution;11 we have therefore estimated the beam profile at\nNWD, NWD+4 mm and +8 mm, by measuring the variation\nof the width of lines as a function of dose. The areal dose is\ndefined as dS= I3 t \/S, where I is the ion current s1 pAd, t is\nREVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS 76, 026105 (2005)\n0034-6748\/2005\/76(2)\/026105\/3\/$22.50 \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics76, 026105-1\nDownloaded 21 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.65.

Ion beams are\nknown to have a Gaussian distribution,7 or Gaussian with\nexponential tails.8,9 Such a dose profile is written as Dsxd\n=dL3disxd ( dL= I3 t \/L is the line dose, L is the length of\nthe line), with\nd1sxd =\na\n\u02db2ps\nexpS\u2212 x22s2D for uxu , x0, s1d\nd2sxd = b expS\u2212 uxu\nb\nD for uxu . x0. s2d\nThe measured width divided by two is then the value x such\nthat Dsxd=d0, so that\ndisxd\nd0\n=\ndiSw2 D\nd0\n=\n1\ndL\n, i = 1,2. s3d\nFigure 2(a) (circles) shows the width vs dose data at NWD\n+8 mm:1\/dL is plotted as a function of x=w \/2, and the data\nhave been made symmetric with respect to the center of the\nbeam. According to Eq. (3), this plot is a direct representa-\ntion of the beam profile disxd \/d0. The central part of the data\nhas been fitted using Eqs. (1) and (3), with a \/d0 and s as\nfree parameters, and the external part of the data have been\nfitted using Eqs. (2) and (3) with b \/d0 and b as free param-\neters. An illustration of the result of the fit is shown Fig. 2(a)\n(solid lines). The values found for s, b, and the ratio R\n=a \/ sb\u02db2psd as a function of WD are shown Fig. 2(b). As\nthe stage is raised, s decreases, b increases, and R increases.\nIn summary, the ion beam is sharper as the WD decreases.\nThe method we have used should be independent of the tar-\nget material and thickness, as the target dependency should\nonly affect the parameter d0. However, this point has not\nbeen verified.\nThe mechanical and thermal stage drift has not been\ntaken into account in the previous beam profile analysis. As\nwe have used exposure times as long as 60 s, its effect can\npotentially be important, especially if the beam is sharp, as in\nthat case broadening due to the distance traveled during ex-\nposure might dominate over the broadening due to the natu-\nral width of the beam. Stage drift rate measurements pre-\nsented in Ref. 13 show that the longer the time elapsed since\nthe last major stage movement, the smaller the drift. We have\nperformed drift measurements on our system in the time\nrange that is of interest for us, namely after up to 30 min\nafter the last main stage movement. No clear trend could be\nobserved with the time after last stage movement between\n30 s and 30 min. The stage drift is isotropic and does not\nslow down with time in the time range investigated. The\nmean distance kRl the stage has moved during t can be mod-\neled as a 2D random walk kRl=\u02dbKt. The diffusion coeffi-\ncient \u02dbK projected on one direction (only the drift in the x\ndirection matters) has been measured at about 1.2 nm s\u22121\/2,\nand up to 2.4 nm s\u22121\/2. We have estimated the effect of the\nstage drift for the sharpest beam profile obtained for NWD\n+8 mm. In the presence of stage drift, Eq. (1) has to be\nslightly transformed, and the dose profile for a time T is\nDsxd=\nI\nL\na\n\u02db2psE0\nT\nexp1\u2212 Sx \u2212\u02dbK2 tD\n2\n2s2\n2dt . s4d\nWe have numerically estimated the width of lines milled\nwith a beam profile such as Eq. (4) with the parameters ob-\ntained at NWD+8 mm. The results are displayed in the inset\nof Fig. 2(a), where the experimental data are shown together\nwith the fits obtained without drift, and the curves obtained\nwhen taking the stage drift into account: the dotted line has\nbeen obtained using \u02dbK=1.2 nm s\u22121\/2, and the dashed lines\nusing 2.4 nm s\u22121\/2. As can be seen on this graph, the scatter-\ning of the experimental data can be explained by the exis-\ntence of this stage drift (the dashed line gives a statistical\nsuperior boundary value to the data). The calculated effect of\nthe stage drift on the width of lines milled with the tails of\nthe ion beam (high doses) is negligible, as can be seen by\ncomparing the dashed line with the corresponding static fit of\nthe experimental data. The analysis we have done without\nconsidering the stage drift has led us to a slight overestima-\ntion of the beam width, and this overestimation is greater as\nthe beam is sharper, i.e., as the WD decreases. Taking the\nstage drift fully into account in the beam shape analysis\nwould then lead to an even greater change in the parameter s\nwith the WD.\nThe shape of the beam profile, more than simply the\nwidth of milled lines, determines the ultimate size of features\nthat can be patterned using FIB, by determining how close\ntwo lines can be brought together (remember FIB patterning\nconsists in removing unwanted parts of the film in order to\nleave the desired structure).

For large enough l, the dose at the center\nposition is negligible in both cases, but for l=50 nm (a), at\nNWD and NWD+8 mm, an 8 nm wide and 18 nm wide area\nis irradiated with a dose of less than d0 \/10, respectively. As\nl decreases further, the center position is more and more\nirradiated, until the two milled lines eventually collapse for l\nsmall enough. For l=40 nm (b), at NWD, the central zone is\nirradiated with a dose sufficient to remove one third of the\nthickness of the film, whereas at NWD+8 mm, an 8 nm\nwide area has received a dose less than d0 \/10. We have\ndemonstrated5 the ability of the FIB to pattern 50 nm wide,\n70 nm thick Hall devices, by milling 4 lines at right angles\nwith a gap at the center. The nanosensors in this paper had\nbeen fabricated using an ion current of 1 pA, an EC of 1 mA,\nand by placing the sample at NWD. None of the devices\nsmaller than 50 nm were electrically viable, and this fact had\nbeen explained qualitatively by evoking a hypothetical\nGaussian profile for the ion beam. We see here more quanti-\ntatively that at NWD, any attempt to decrease this distance in\norder to make the Hall sensor smaller, is causing the central\npart to be seriously irradiated, and therefore partly milled\naway, consequently less likely to sustain any electrical cur-\nrent. At NWD+8 mm, on the contrary, the same central irra-\ndiation dose is not attained for l=40 nm. Fabricating the Hall\nstructures at this reduced WD should allow a further reduc-\ntion of their sizes. We have indeed been able to fabricate\n40 nm wide Hall probes which can sustain a current of a few\ntens of mA. Figure 4 shows a SEM image of one of these\n40 nm wide, 50 nm thick Hall devices. Its Hall sensitivity RH\nhas been measured at 5310\u22128 V mT\u22121 (30 mA driving cur-\nrent and B\u2019=0.12 T), its series resistance at 4 kV, and its\ntransverse offset resistance, due to an unavoidable misalign-\nment in the voltage pads at the center, at 26.6 V, consistent\nwith the high specific resistivity of Bi in very small struc-\ntures. The longitudinal and transverse I\u2013V curves (not shown\nhere) under zero magnetic field have been found Ohmic.\nWe have presented in this paper results concerning pat-\nterning resolution using a commercial FIB system. Single\npixel lines have been milled on a 50 nm thick Bi film depos-\nited on SiO2 and the effect of changing FIB parameters such\nas the EC and the WD, has been studied by measuring their\nwidths. The beam profile has been measured: it has an in-\ntense Gaussian central part, which deviates two to three or-\nders of magnitude below the maximum value to exponential\ntails. Reducing the EC and the WD significantly improves\nthe resolution, and the effect of the latter has been quantified\nby measuring the change in the beam shape parameters. By\noptimizing the fabrication conditions, we have fabricated\n40 nm wide Hall sensors whose transport parameters are\npresented.\nThis work has been supported by UK EPSRC.\n1 U. D\u00f6tsch and A.
