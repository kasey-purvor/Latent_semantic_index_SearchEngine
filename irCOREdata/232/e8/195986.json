The ionospheric plasma is continually perturbed\nby ultra-low frequency (ULF; 1\u2013100 mHz) plasma waves\nthat are incident from the magnetosphere. In this paper we\npresent a combined experimental and modeling study of the\nvariation in radio frequency of signals propagating in the\nionosphere due to the interaction of ULF wave energy with\nthe ionospheric plasma. Modeling the interaction shows that\nthe magnitude of the ULF wave electric field, e, and the ge-\nomagnetic field, B0, giving an e\u00d7B0 drift, is the dominant\nmechanism for changing the radio frequency. We also show\nhow data from high frequency (HF) Doppler sounders can be\ncombined with HF radar data to provide details of the spa-\ntial structure of ULF wave energy in the ionosphere. Due to\nspatial averaging effects, the spatial structure of ULF waves\nmeasured in the ionosphere may be quite different to that ob-\ntained using ground based magnetometer arrays. The ULF\nwave spatial structure is shown to be a critical parameter that\ndetermines how ULF wave effects alter the frequency of HF\nsignals propagating through the ionosphere.\nKeywords.

The ionospheric plasma causes refraction of the HF\nsignal that facilitates long distance communication. While\nthe telecommunications industry is relying more on higher\nfrequency (GHz) satellite transmissions, there remain appli-\ncations for HF propagation, such as over-the-horizon radars\n(OTHR), that are sensitive to ionosphere dynamics. An im-\nCorrespondence to: C. L. Waters\n(colin.waters@newcastle.edu.au)\nportant natural source of energy that perturbs the ionospheric\nplasma is ultra-low frequency (ULF; 1\u2013100 mHz) plasma\nwaves, incident from the near-Earth space environment. In\nthis paper, we present two examples of HF signals that prop-\nagate in the ionosphere and change frequency in sympathy\nwith incident ULF wave perturbations. The interaction be-\ntween ULF wave activity and frequency changes in the HF\nsignal are modeled using parameters tailored to the particular\nevents. The detailed modeling shows the critical dependence\nof the interaction on the ULF wave spatial structure, which\nin turn is best determined using HF techniques.\nThe energy source for ULF waves in near-Earth space can\nbe traced to solar activity. The magnetosphere, bow shock\nand magnetopause are ULF wave generation regions and\nthese waves reach the mid and low latitude ionosphere af-\nter traversing the magnetosphere (Yumoto et al., 1985). ULF\nwaves that can propagate through the cold plasma of the\nmagnetosphere exist as two modes known as the fast and\nshear Alfve\u00b4n, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes\n(e.g. Stix, 1962). The presently accepted scenario is that fast\nmode waves that can propagate across the geomagnetic field,\nmode convert and excite the shear Alfve\u00b4n mode (Dungey,\n1954; Chen and Hasegawa, 1974; Southwood, 1974). An\nimportant property of the shear Alfve\u00b4n mode is that the wave\nenergy is guided along the geomagnetic field even if the prop-\nagation vector, kA, is oblique to the geomagnetic field direc-\ntion. For typical daytime ionosphere conditions, the shear\nAlfve\u00b4n wave has a near unity reflection coefficient at con-\njugate ionospheres and forms field line resonances (FLRs)\nwhere the ULF amplitude is enhanced and the resonant fre-\nquency depends on latitude (Dungey, 1954; Samson and Ros-\ntoker, 1972; Takahashi, 1991; Waters, 2000). The ionosphere\nrepresents the inner boundary for near Earth space processes\nand in particular, ULF waves which are always present in the\nEarth\u2019s magnetosphere.\nThe propagation path, s, of HF signals in the ionosphere\ndepends on the radio frequency, fR, and the real part of the\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1114 C.

Temporal variations in the refrac-\ntive index produce a frequency shift, 1f , in the HF signal.\nFor \u03c6, the angle between the direction of HF energy trans-\nport and the wave normal, the frequency shift is given by\napplication of Fermat\u2019s principle as (e.g. Bennett, 1967)\n1f = \u2212fR\nc\n\u222b\ns\n\u2202\u00b5\n\u2202t\ncos\u03c6 ds (1)\nwhere c is the speed of light in vacuum. A mathematical de-\nscription for the frequency shift in HF signals due to ULF\nenergy in the ionosphere was formulated by Rishbeth and\nGarriott (1964) who proposed two mechanisms. The first in-\nvolved a polarization electric field, generated in the E region\nand influencing the F region as an e\u00d7B0 drift. The second\nmechanism described bulk motion of the F region plasma due\nto the ULF wave. Jacobs and Watanabe (1966) improved the\nmodel by including changes in the refractive index due to\nvariations in the ionospheric electron distribution.\nA more complete theory was developed in a series of pa-\npers by Poole and Sutcliffe (1987), Poole et al. (1988) and\nSutcliffe and Poole (1989, 1990) which we will denote as\nthe SP model. The variation in frequency was described as\nan effective Doppler \u201cvelocity\u201d, V \u2217, which is related to the\nfrequency shift by (Poole et al., 1988),\n1f = 2fR V\n\u2217\nc\n(2)\nAssuming no overall gain or loss in the electron population,\nthe SP model identified three mechanisms that might alter\nthe ionosphere refractive index, thereby changing the HF fre-\nquency. For vertical incidence, B0 has parallel or longitudi-\nnal, (BL) and transverse (BT ) components to the radio wave\nnormal direction. For N , the electron concentration and zR ,\nthe HF reflection height, the Doppler velocity is given by\n(Poole et al., 1988)\nV \u2217 =\n\u222b ZR\n0\n[\n\u2202\u00b5\n\u2202BL\n\u2202BL\n\u2202t\n+ \u2202\u00b5\n\u2202BT\n\u2202BT\n\u2202t\n+ \u2202\u00b5\n\u2202N\n\u2202N\n\u2202t\n]\ndz (3)\nFor a coordinate system where X is positive northward, Y is\npositive eastward and Z completes the right handed system,\nthe Doppler velocity from the magnetic mechanism in the SP\nmodel is\nV1 = \u2212i\u03c9\n\u222b ZR\n0\n[\n\u2202\u00b5\n\u2202BL\n\u2202BL\n\u2202t\n+ \u2202\u00b5\n\u2202BT\n\u2202BT\n\u2202t\n]\ndz (4)\nwhere the background magnetic field, B0=BL+BT, the vec-\ntor sum of longitudinal and transverse components respec-\ntively and the magnetic field varies as B=B0+b0e\u2212i\u03c9t .\nEquation (4) describes the change in \u00b5 due to magnetic field\nvariations from the ULF wave. The advection mechanism\ninvolves the electron density, N , and is given by\nV2 = \u2212\n\u222b ZR\n0\n[\n\u2202\u00b5\n\u2202N\n(v \u00b7 \u2207N)\n]\ndz (5)\nThis describes the vertical bulk motion of electrons driven by\nthe electric field of the ULF wave and is essentially the same\nas the first mechanism described by Rishbeth and Garriott\n(1964). The compression mechanism is\nV3 = \u2212\n\u222b ZR\n0\n[\n\u2202\u00b5\n\u2202N\nN(\u2207 \u00b7 v)\n]\ndz (6)\nwhich changes the refractive index by altering the electron\ndensity due to the compression\/rarefraction of the plasma by\nthe ULF wave fields.\nComparisons between ULF wave activity recorded by\nground based magnetometers and associated variations in\nthe frequency of HF waves reflected from the ionosphere\nhave been reported by a number of researchers (Watermann,\n1987; Menk, 1992; Wright et al., 1999). Most studies em-\nploy a \u201cDoppler sounder\u201d configuration consisting of a con-\ntinuous wave (CW) transmitter\/receiver system that monitors\nan ultra-stable frequency in the HF band. Phase-locked loop\ncircuits in the receiver detect changes in frequency as a func-\ntion of time while a nearby vector magnetometer monitors\nULF wave activity.\nULF wave signatures have also been detected in the iono-\nsphere using coherent-scatter radars. The ULF activity usu-\nally appears as FLRs, detected in the E-region (e.g. Walker\net al., 1979; Yeoman et al., 1990) and F-region (e.g. Ruo-\nhoniemi et al., 1991; Fenrich et al., 1995) of the ionosphere.\nHowever, some non-resonant ULF wave signatures have also\nbeen reported (e.g. Allan et al., 1983). An important ULF\nwave parameter is the azimuthal wave number, m, which has\nbeen used to estimate the longitudinal spatial variation from\nground based magnetometer array data for many years (e.g.\nHerron, 1966; Olson and Rostoker, 1978). For two magne-\ntometers located at the same latitude, \u03bb, separated by a dis-\ntance in longitude of S km, the m number was given by Olson\nand Rostoker (1978) as\nm = 2piR1\u03c6\n360S\ncos \u03bb (7)\nwhere R is the Earth radius (km) and 1\u03c6 is the estimated\nphase difference in degrees. This is an important parame-\nter in ULF wave research as ULF wave generation mecha-\nnisms based on the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (e.g. South-\nwood, 1968) predict a specific range of values form. Further-\nmore, the amplitude of ULF waves detected at the ground is\nreduced for large azimuthal wave numbers (Nishida, 1964;\nHughes and Southwood, 1976a) effectively shielding high-\nm ULF wave activity from the ground. ULF wave spatial\nstructures estimated from HF radar data have been compared\nwith m numbers obtained using ground based magnetometer\narray data. These comparisons have shown up to 5 times dif-\nference in values for m (e.g. Ziesolleck et al., 1998). Pono-\nmarenko et al. (2001) interpreted this discrepancy in terms\nof the spatial scale size of the ULF energy in the ionosphere\nand how a ground magnetometer integrates the contribution\nfrom the associated ionospheric currents. This has important\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 1113\u20131124, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1113\/2007\/\nC. L.

Parallel to these observations, the SP model has de-\nveloped as the favoured theoretical description of these ef-\nfects. However, model and experimental comparisons have\nonly been reported in a general sense where the model com-\nparisons are made using published figures and tables. Fur-\nthermore, the ULF wave electric field has previously been\nobtained from the model discussed by Hughes (1974) and\nHughes and Southwood (1976b). Recent developments have\nimproved this description, allowing for a mixture of incident\nfast and shear Alfve\u00b4n modes and the inductive response of the\nionosphere (Sciffer and Waters, 2002; Sciffer et al., 2004).\nIn this paper, we take the coherent scatter radar, Doppler\nsounder and ground magnetometer data and run the SP and\nimproved ULF wave models specifically for the observed ex-\nperimental parameters. In order to do this, models for both\nULF and HF wave propagation through the ionosphere are\nrequired. The SP model was coded directly from Sutcliffe\nand Poole (1989) using the electron collision frequencies and\nmobilities to estimate the e\u00d7B0 term. The model for the in-\nteraction of ULF waves with the ionosphere is more involved\nand is described in the next section.\n2 ULF waves and the ionosphere\nGround based magnetometer arrays provide the main data\nsource for studying ULF wave properties. Since the ULF\nwave energy must pass through the ionosphere to reach\nground based sensors, a number of studies have examined the\npropagation of ULF waves from the magnetosphere through\nthe ionosphere to the ground (Hughes, 1974; Ellis and South-\nwood., 1983; Waters et al., 2001; Ponomarenko et al., 2001;\nSciffer et al., 2005). Analytic models treat the ionosphere as\na thin current sheet whose properties can be characterised by\nheight integrated Pedersen and Hall conductivities (Hughes,\n1974; Sciffer and Waters, 2002). However, determining fre-\nquency shifts in HF signals due to ULF wave energy in the\nionosphere requires a knowledge of the ULF wave fields as\na function of altitude. One way of obtaining the altitude\nvariation of ULF wave electric and magnetic fields is to use\nthe procedure in Hughes (1974) and Hughes and Southwood\n(1976a). Their model was formulated as an initial value\nproblem, which is susceptible to numerical swamping (Pit-\nteway, 1965), and limited in application to incident shear\nAlfven mode waves. A more flexible formulation was given\nby Zhang and Cole (1994, 1995) who recast the equations\nas a boundary value problem. However, the Zhang and Cole\nformulation was developed for vertical B0.\nA boundary value formulation that allows for oblique B0\nand both MHD wave modes was developed by (Sciffer et al.,\n2005). ULF wave energy, incident from the magnetosphere\nis described as an electromagnetic disturbance.

The model was de-\nveloped to allow for the existence of both the shear Alfve\u00b4n\nand fast mode waves up to the top boundary. Details of the\nderivation for this type of boundary condition are given in\nSciffer et al.

Data for the respective collision frequencies below\n80 km altitude were extrapolated to the ground using the ex-\npressions given in Zhang and Cole (1994).\n3 DOPE and ground magnetometer data\nThe Doppler Pulsation Experiment (DOPE) is operated by\nthe Radio and Space Plasma Physics Group at the Univer-\nsity of Leicester, UK and has been recording coincident HF\nand ULF data since mid-1995. The DOPE system is located\nnear Troms\u00f8, Norway (geographic: 69.6 N, 19.2 E) and con-\nsists of frequency stable transmitter\/receivers (Yeoman et al.,\n2000). The system incorporates two altitude separated paths\nat 4.16 and 5.25 MHz (Ramfjordmoen-Seljelvnes) that are\nused to check phase consistency to eliminate possible infra-\nsonic modes, and two paths that are azimuthally separated\nfrom these at 5.73 and 5.26 MHz (Ramfjordmoen-Skibotn\nand Ramfjordmoen-Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, respectively). In this pa-\nper, we present data from the 4.16 MHz path and azimuthal\nwave numbers from DOPE are calculated from the 5.25 and\n5.73 MHz path. Further details of the configuration are de-\nscribed in Yeoman et al. (2000). The transmitter radiates a\nfixed frequency, continuous wave (CW) signal which is re-\nceived \u223c50 km away. Data at the receiver are sampled at\n40 Hz and processed through a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)\nalgorithm (512 points per FFT) to provide a Doppler trace\nthat has a time resolution of 12.8 s. The ULF variations in\nthe magnetic field were detected by the IMAGE vector mag-\nnetometer array (Luhr, 1994). The magnetometer data were\nsampled at 10 s intervals and are presented in geographic co-\nordinates.\n3.1 Event 1: 25 March 2002\nTime series data, recorded 16:00\u201318:00 UT on 25 March\n2002 by DOPE, the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (Su-\nperDARN) located near Hankasalmi (Finland) and the mag-\nnetometer located near Troms\u00f8 are shown in Fig. 1. The Su-\nperDARN data, including received power and spectral width\ninformation (not shown) indicate that Doppler velocity vari-\nations seen over 16:40\u201317:20 UT by the Hankasalmi radar\nare from single hop, ground scatter. The DOPE data are de-\nrived from the FFT of the HF receiver data and the scatter\nof points (in Hz) for each time slice indicates the spectral\nwidth. The DOPE time series shows a low frequency oscilla-\ntion over 16:40\u201317:20 UT followed by a change to a higher\nfrequency oscillation that does not appear in the magnetome-\nter time series. For the oscillation after 17:20 UT, measure-\nments from the multiple propagation paths from DOPE give\nan estimate of the longitudinal spatial structure as m\u223c150.\nA fast mode with this spatial scale would be highly evanes-\ncent. Therefore, this higher frequency, high-m oscillation is\nnot a conventional fast mode driven FLR event. Since spa-\ntial integration effects prohibit this signal being detected by\nthe ground magnetometer, we focus on the lower frequency,\nlow-m event before 17:20 UT.\nCoincident, ULF oscillations are seen in the radar, DOPE\nand magnetometer data over 16:40\u201317:20 UT.

Using the Y component data from\nthe IMAGE magnetometers, the azimuthal wave number at\n2.8 mHz, from Eq. (7) was found to be m\u223c2. The m num-\nber was also estimated using the multiple beam data from the\nHankasalmi radar (m\u223c2) and the different propagation paths\nof DOPE where m\u223c4 was obtained. However, the small spa-\ntial separation of the beams from DOPE (0.44 deg) make\nlow-m measurements difficult (Yeoman et al., 2000).\nThe ULF and HF variations shown in Figs. 1 and 2 need\nto be put into context. The Kp index is a general indicator\nof global magnetic variation activity. For 25 March 2002,\nthe Kp activity index was around 2+, except for the 06:00\u2013\n12:00 UT interval when Kp\u223c0.

The cross phase spectrum of\nthe data from two latitudinally spaced magnetometers can be\nused to identify the FLR frequency at the location between\nthe magnetometer sites (e.g. Waters et al., 1991, 1996). An\nanalysis of the Soroya (SOR) and Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (KIL) magne-\ntometer data is ideal for estimating any resonant frequency\ndetected by the Troms\u00f8 magnetometer. Taking various mag-\nnetometer pairs from the IMAGE magnetometer network the\nFLR frequencies versus latitude were obtained from the cross\nphase data and are shown in Fig. 3. The 2.8 mHz signal seen\nin the Troms\u00f8 magnetometer data is consistent with the FLR\ncontinuum for this interval.

The higher FLR frequency compared\nwith the first event is most likely due to a decrease in the\nequatorial plasma mass density near geosynchronous orbit.\nThese two cases represent low and medium m number\nULF wave events. For both of these, the Troms\u00f8 dynasonde\ndata were obtained. Modeling the interaction of the ULF\nwith the HF signals requires knowledge of various parame-\nters of the ionosphere as a function of height. The EISCAT\ndynasonde data were used to calculate the electron concen-\ntration with height and these values agreed with those ob-\ntained from the IRI2001 model runs. The dynasonde data\ndo not directly provide information on the ion composition\nwith height. However, since the electron concentration val-\nues were in good agreement, we have assumed that the iono-\nsphere was reasonably approximated by the IRI2001 model.\n4 Modeling the ULF and HF interaction\nThe relationship between the ULF and HF signals in the\nionosphere was investigated using the SP model. The ULF\nelectric and magnetic wave fields were computed as a func-\ntion of altitude as described in Sect. 2. The ULF model\nrequires details of the incident ULF wave modes, hori-\nzontal wave numbers and ULF frequency.

Power spectrum of the magnetometer and DOPE data shown\nin Fig. 4.\nindicates the valley in the electron density between the E and\nF regions. The DOPE frequency of 4.16 MHz corresponds\nwith an altitude of 200 km. Here the Doppler shifts from\nthe model are V1=0.002 Hz (0.06 m\/s), V2=0.34 Hz (12 m\/s),\nV3=0.01 Hz (0.5 m\/s) and V \u2217=0.34 Hz (12 m\/s). Therefore,\nthe major contributor to the Doppler shift is the advection\nmechanism, V2=0.34 Hz, driven by the vertical bulk elec-\ntron motion as a e\u00d7B0 drift process. Experimenting with the\ninput fast mode mix at 1000 km we found that increasing the\nfast mode component decreased the resulting Doppler shifts.\nThis is due to the horizontal ULF wave electric field vector\nswinging around into the X direction (aligning with the trans-\nverse component of B0) as more fast mode energy is added,\nreducing the magnitude of e\u00d7B0.\nThe ULF and SP models were also used to compare the\nground magnetometer and DOPE data recorded on 24 March\n2001.

An in-\ncident shear Alfve\u00b4n wave mode was used. For this case,\nwhen some fast mode was mixed at the top boundary of\nthe model (1000 km), the Doppler shift increased. The top\npanel shows the well known 90\u25e6 rotation of the wave fields as\nthey pass from the ionosphere where \u2207\u00d7b6=0 into the neu-\ntral atmosphere where \u2207\u00d7b=0 (Hughes, 1983). The ULF\nwave horizontal electric fields are essentially constant with\nheight at \u223c2 mV\/m. For the DOPE operating frequency at\n4.16 MHz, the reflection altitude was 226 km. At this alti-\ntude the Doppler shifts from the model were V1=0.002 Hz\n(0.07 m\/s), V2=0.65 Hz (23 m\/s), V3=0.09 Hz (3.3 m\/s) and\nV \u2217=0.62 Hz (22 m\/s). Therefore, the major contributor is\nonce again the advection mechanism with the Doppler shift\ndriven by the vertical bulk electron motion.\n5 Discussion\nThe time variation of Doppler shifts obtained from DOPE\ncompared with the magnetometer data and associated mod-\neling for both events show very good agreement. The ex-\nperimental data constrains the model parameters to a certain\nextent. These are the Doppler shifts measured by the HF in-\nstrumentation, the magnitudes of the horizontal components\nof the ULF magnetic perturbations from ground magnetome-\nters and the ULF and HF frequencies. The less certain pa-\nrameters in the modeling process are the horizontal spatial\nstructure of the ULF energy and the ULF wave mode mix.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1113\/2007\/ Ann.

Waters et al.: Modulation of radio frequency signals by ULF waves 1121\nThe 1-D modeling used for the ULF wave infor-\nmation assumes horizontal spatial structure according to\nei(kxx+kyy\u2212\u03c9t). The parameter, ky , or m number is routinely\nused in ULF wave research. Given that the longitudinal spac-\ning for the propagation paths used by DOPE is \u223c0.4 degree,\nonly the high-m events yield low uncertainty estimates for\nky . Estimating m numbers from ground magnetometer data\ncan give inaccurate values due to spatial integration effects\n(Ponomarenko et al., 2001). Ideally, the SuperDARN instru-\nmentation, using ionosphere scatter signals from the crossed\nbeam pattern from at least two radars would provide un-\nprecedented spatial structure information of the ULF pertur-\nbations. However, despite a search for such cases, no crossed\nbeam, ionospheric scatter ULF wave events have been iden-\ntified.\nFor both events presented here, the ULF perturbations\nwere found in the Hankasalmi radar data. The associ-\nated radar forming crossed beams is located in Iceland and\nshowed no returns. This turned out to be irrelevant as the\nULF perturbations seen in the Hankasalmi radar data were\nfrom ground scatter and thus correspond to half the range\nnormally shown on SuperDARN data plots. Fortunately, this\nplaced the Hankasalmi radar beam ionosphere \u2019reflection\u2019\nscatter very close to the Troms\u00f8 magnetometer. The spatial\nstructure of the Doppler velocity amplitude and phase for the\n2.8 mHz ULF wave recorded on 25 March 2002 are shown\nin Fig. 9. The variation of the phase with longitude provides\nthe estimate for ky while the Doppler velocity magnitudes\nagree with those from DOPE. The finding that the m value\nestimates obtained from the magnetometer, DOPE and the\nSuperDARN data are consistent indicates that we have real-\nistic estimates for ky .\nAn estimate for kx is not so straightforward. An estimate\nfrom Fig. 9 may appear possible, provided scatter from suffi-\ncient ranges are obtained. A complication involves the latitu-\ndinal spatial structure associated with an FLR. The quality of\nthe resonance alters the amplitude and phasing with latitude\nthat defies a simple kx description. For modeling in 1-D, we\nhave used the relationship derived from \u2207\u00d7b=0 to obtain kx\nfrom ky , bx , and by . This approach appears to be adequate\nfor modeling the correct ratio of the ground magnetic field\nperturbations and the Doppler shifts.\nIn order to determine how the Doppler shift is related to the\nchoice of kx we have run the modeling for two cases where\nkx was varied. The parameters for 24 March 2001 were used\nwhere the ULF wave contained a 10% fast mode mix at the\ntop boundary (1000 km), at a frequency of 5 mHz, and the\nionosphere and atmosphere models were set for the Troms\u00f8\nlocation and 05:00 UT. The first case assumes that the ground\nmagnetometers record equal amplitude for the bx and by per-\nturbations. Therefore, we varied kx keeping kx=ky . The\namplitude of the Doppler shift (V \u2217 in Hz) as a function of\naltitude and kx is shown in the top panel of Fig. 10. The am-\nplitude of the magnetic perturbations at the ground have been\nkept at 5 nT for all runs. The Doppler shift scales linearly\nTroms\u00f8\nFig. 9.

Therefore, the Doppler\nshift values in Fig. 10 reflect the orientation and magnitude\nof the horizontal ULF electric field. The variation of the ULF\nelectric field depends on the details of the interaction of ULF\nenergy with the ionosphere including complex reflection and\nULF wave mode conversion coefficients (Sciffer and Waters,\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1113\/2007\/ Ann.

For\nkx>1\u00d710\u22126 m\u22121, the fast mode is evanescant and the ampli-\ntude decreases with altitude. The smaller wave field resulting\nfrom the decreasing fast mode is boosted in the scaling pro-\ncess to keep by=5 nT at the ground, giving the larger Doppler\nshifts. For kx<3\u00d710\u22127 m\u22121 the fast mode has only real kz.\nThe increased Doppler shifts for these smaller values for kx\narise from the increased electric field magnitudes resulting\nfrom the complex addition of the incident and reflected fast\nand shear Alfve\u00b4n modes.\nFor the bottom panel in Fig. 10, ky and by at the ground are\nkept constant while kx varies. As kx increases, the orienta-\ntion and magnitude of the horizontal component of the ULF\nwave electric field changes. In particular, while ey stays rel-\natively constant, ex begins smaller than ey , becomes equal\nfor kx=1.5\u00d710\u22126 m\u22121 and ends up larger than ey . There-\nfore, the larger ey determines the Doppler shift giving the\nquite constant values up until kx\u223c1\u00d710\u22126 m\u22121. Above that,\nthe evanescent fields increase by scaling to keep by at the\nground at 5 nT.\nThe exploration of associated Doppler shifts for more real-\nistic spatial structures associated with FLRs can be achieved\nin higher dimesional ULF wave models. Extending the ULF\nwave modeling into at least a 2-D magnetosphere that in-\ncludes a realistic ionosphere description is work in progress.\nThis will also allow for non-uniformity of the ionosphere and\nmore complex ULF wave spatial structure in the horizontal\nplane.\nEstimating the MHD wave mode mixture is difficult and\nmost ULF wave models for the ionosphere have only consid-\nered incident shear Alfve\u00b4n mode energy. In general, a ULF\ndisturbance in the magnetosphere may contain shear Alfve\u00b4n\nmode from the FLR continuum and fast mode energy arising\nfrom mode conversion by the anisotropic ionosphere and the\ninput ULF energy source. An indication of whether there is\nsome shear Alfve\u00b4n mode can be obtained by the proximity of\nthe observed ULF frequency to the FLR frequency. This is\nthe purpose of Figs. 3 and 6 which indicate that both events\nare likely to have a significant shear Alfve\u00b4n component. Fur-\nthermore, kx and ky along with the local Alfve\u00b4n speed de-\ntermine whether the fast mode will propagate in the vertical\ndirection or is evanescent. The extension of the ULF model-\ning in higher dimensions will allow a more complete under-\nstanding of the appropriate ULF wave mode mix.\n6 Conclusion\nWe have described the first comparisons of observed changes\nin radio frequency with the predictions of the SP model\nthat use parameters relevant for particular ULF wave events.\nThe experimental constraints are the radio frequency, the ob-\nserved Doppler shifts and the ULF magnetic perturbations at\nthe ground. Using models for the atmosphere and ionosphere\ncomposition, we have shown that the SP model predicts the\ncorrect magnitudes for the Doppler shifts and identifies the\nadvection mechanism as the dominant process that changes\nthe HF frequency, caused by the presence of ULF waves in-\nteracting with the ionosphere. At present the SP model is\napplicable for vertical incidence of the HF signal. Future im-\nprovements will allow for oblique HF propagation and higher\ndimensional ULF wave modeling that more completely de-\nscribes the transfer of ULF wave energy between the magne-\ntosphere and ionosphere.\nAnn.
