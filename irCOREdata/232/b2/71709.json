The challenge is thus to develop programmes aimed\nat \u2018developing healthy communities which support older\npeople to live lives which are as fulfilling as possible\u2019\n(DoH, 2001, p. 107).\nThe promotion of gardening activity, we suggest,\nrepresents one way in which the goals of healthy aging\nmay be successfully achieved. The data on social and\nleisure trends not only indicate a steady rise in those\nadults participating in gardening activity in the UK over\nthe last 20 years or so (GHS, 1997) but also indicates\nthat as many as 61% of those in the 60\u201369 age group\ngarden at least once per month (MINTEL, 1999). It is\nunclear from this national survey data just exactly how\ngardening has been defined: whether this incorporates\nlight pruning (light motor involvement), heavy diggingd.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1The study on which this paper is based was funded by the\nDepartment of Health (former North and Yorkshire region) as\npart of the Healthy Aging Initiative.\nC. Milligan et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 58 (2004) 1781\u201317931782(aerobic motor tasks), pushing or simply sitting on a\nlawnmower. Nevertheless, the explosion of radio and\ntelevision programmes, magazines, and books all\ndevoted to gardens and gardening activity attest to a\ngrowing national interest in gardening as a leisure\nactivity.\nInterest in the cultivation of gardens has a long and\nrespected history\u2014ranging from the ancient Hanging\nGardens of Babylon to the small city gardens of\ncontemporary suburbia. However, while gardening has\nbeen seen by individuals as, essentially, a leisure activity,\nit has also been suggested that the cultivation of a\ngarden plot may offer a simple way of harnessing the\nhealing power of nature (Norfolk, 2000). One implica-\ntion of this is that gardens and gardening activity may\noffer a key site of comfort and a vital opportunity for\nindividuals\u2019 mental, physical and spiritual renewal.\nThough there is a significant literature that addresses\nthe issue of horticulture and health (e.g. Gallagher &\nMattson, 1986; Lecchese, 1994; Lemaitre et al., 1999), as\nPatterson and Chang (1999) note, those studies that\nfocus on the specific health benefits of gardening tend to\nfocus, in the main, on physical activity interventions,\nexamining their importance in reducing specific chronic\nor life-threatening conditions. While a few researchers\nhave pointed to the general health benefits of regular\ngardening activity (e.g. Galloway & Jokl, 2000; Galgali,\nNorton, & Campbell, 1998; Lecchese, 1994), work has\ntended to focus largely on the more specific benefits to\nphysical health. So, e.g. Lemaitre et al. (1999) have\nlooked at the role of gardening in reducing the risk of\ncardiovascular disease, whilst others have considered its\nrole in reducing HDL cholesterol levels in elderly men\n(Bijnen et al., 1996); in improving diabetes care\n(Armstrong, 2000a); and reducing the risk of gastro-\nintestinal haemorrhage (Pahor et al., 1994). Additional\nstudies have examined the benefits of gardening as a\nmeans of assessing and improving dexterity and the co-\nordination skills of in-patients in hospital settings (e.g.\nMcBey, 1985). Though studies of this nature are\nimportant in highlighting the health benefits of garden-\ning activity for specific conditions, their singular focus\nmeans they do not address the wider psychological and\nsocial factors of gardening activity that can have a major\nimpact on people\u2019s health status.\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that there may be a direct\ncorrelation between gardening activity and mental well\nbeing. As noted in one newspaper article: \u2018I arrive, most\noften, feeling stressed. I leave\u2014slugs permitting\u2014re-\nfreshed, with a new sense of well being and (on a good\nday) chard and borlotti beans, raspberries and rocket\u2019\n(Fowler, 2002). Brown and Jameton (2000, p. 28)\nsupport this view, noting that, \u2018recreational gardening\nhas been observed to be a way to relax and release\nstress\u2019. The work of Patterson and Chang (1999) in\nAustralia also points to a possible causal associationbetween physical activity, such as gardening, and\nreduced anxiety and depression. Moreover, it has been\nsuggested that in addition to promoting improvements\nin physical and mental well being, gardening, as a\ntherapeutic activity, may also provide opportunities for\nempowerment and increased competence, building\nbridges to naturally occurring supports and resources\nwithin the broader community (Myers, 1998; Arm-\nstrong, 2000b).\nThere is little published research, however, that\nfocuses specifically on the health benefits of gardening\nfor older people (though see Wells, 1997) and even less\non the benefits for their mental well being. This omission\nis a surprising one, given the extent to which older\npeople participate in this activity. Even more surprising,\ngiven the attention geographers have devoted to\nincreasing our understanding of the importance of space\nand place in influencing health outcomes (see e.g. Jones\n& Moon, 1987; Curtis & Taket, 1996; Kearns & Gesler,\n1998; Gatrell, 2002) is the lack of geographical work in\nthis area. While geographers such as Crouch (see\nCrouch & Ward, 1997) have emphasised the importance\nof allotment gardening in urban environments, the focus\nhas been on its history and culture rather than its role in\nimproving the health of older people. In this paper, we\ngo some way toward redressing these gaps by building\non, and extending, the somewhat limited evidence base\nsurrounding the role of landscape and gardening activity\nin promoting healthy aging. In doing so, we endeavour\nto lay down a foundation for future geographical\nresearch and a guide to policy makers on the scope for\nusing gardening activities to improve the health and well\nbeing of older people. We do so by examining,\nempirically, the role of landscape, gardens and garden-\ning activity in improving the health and well being of\nolder people living in Northern England.1Cultivating the concept: the \u2018therapeutic landscape\u2019\nDrawing on the early geographical work of Appleton\n(1975), studies in landscape perception and environ-\nmental psychology have argued that the relationship\nbetween humans and the natural environment is an\nevolutionary one. Individual feelings and cognitions\nrelated to preferences for environments provide features\nof either \u2018prospect\u2019 (having an overall grand view of the\nlandscape, with potential for discovering resources) or\n\u2018refuge\u2019 (offering a place to hide from danger or threats)\nand arise in response to stimuli and circumstances in\nways that promote the performance of the most adaptive\nresponses at the time (Mealey & Theis, 1995, p. 248).\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n2Allotments refer to small pieces of land rented (usually from\nlocal authorities) for the purposes of cultivation. In non-UK\nsettings these may sometimes be referred to as community\ngardens.\nC. Milligan et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 58 (2004) 1781\u20131793 1783Given that responses are contingent on an individual\u2019s\nperception of the immediate circumstances, they argue,\nlandscape preferences will be related to emotions and\nmood. Such an approach, however, is somewhat limited.\nRather than viewing the relationship between humans\nand the natural environment as a simple binary one, the\ngeographical literature has been concerned to draw out\nthe complexity of this relationship (see e.g. Meinig, 1979;\nCosgrove, 1984; Burgess, 1988, 1996; Duncan & Ley,\n1993; Bingley, 2003). Hence, geographers have drawn\nattention to the intricate intermingling of the physical,\nbiological and cultural features of our surroundings.\nMeinig, in particular, wrote not only of the relational\nlink between landscape and humankind, but also of the\nindividuality of this relationship, where textures, sights,\nsounds and smells create a subtly unique \u2018feel\u2019 to places\nthat are of immense importance to life. As Tuan (1979,\np. 89) put it, \u2018Landscape is a construct of the mind and\nfeeling\u2019 and as such, we respond in automatic and\nsubconscious ways. Such a view insists that our\nindividual lives are affected in myriad ways by the\nparticular places in which we live, linking us as\nindividual souls and psyches to the wider world.\nOf particular importance to our study is the more\nrecent geographical work of Gesler (1992, 1993) on the\nnotion of \u2018therapeutic landscapes\u2019. Gesler suggests that\ncertain environments promote mental and physical well\nbeing and that these landscapes are not necessarily\n\u2018natural\u2019 but can be created. Gesler\u2019s concept suggests\nthat specific landscapes not only provide an identity,\nsatisfying a human need for roots, but can also act as the\nlocation of social networks, providing settings for\ntherapeutic activities. This is based on an understanding\nof the ways in which environmental, societal and\nindividual factors can work together to preserve health\nand well being. Hence, place is understood as being\nrelational, influenced not only by the physical environ-\nment, but also by the human mind and material\ncircumstances\u2014reflecting both human agency (through\nintentions and actions) as well as the structures and\nconstraints imposed by society (Williams, 1999). The\nconcept of the \u2018therapeutic landscape\u2019 is thus concerned\nwith a holistic, socio-ecological model of health that\nfocuses on those complex interactions that include the\nphysical, mental, emotional, spiritual, societal and\nenvironmental (Williams, 1998).\nDiscourse around the concept, however, has been\nlargely confined to the abstract and historical, taking\nsingular, famous and\/or one-off events or places such as\nspas, baths, national parks and hospitals as the focus of\nconcern (e.g. Gesler, 1996, 1998; Kearns & Barnett,\n1999; Palka, 1999). While this discourse has been of\nconsiderable importance in developing our understand-\ning of the role of place in contributing to health and well\nbeing, to date it has largely ignored the differing scales at\nwhich therapeutic landscapes are manifest and experi-enced. In particular, it has tended to overlook those\nordinary everyday places that are less easy to map in the\ntraditional manner (Wilson, 2003). Williams (2002)\nfurther argues that, while the literature points to the\nuse of therapeutic landscapes in the healing and recovery\nprocess, they can also be used in the maintenance of\nhealth and well being. It is these two particular aspects\nof the therapeutic landscape that our work seeks to\naddress. We do so by examining how common,\ndispersed, everyday places such as domestic gardens\nand allotments can facilitate the maintenance of health\nand mental well being amongst older people.2 Further,\nwe suggest that while much of the existing work around\ntherapeutic landscapes focuses on how existing or\nhistorical places might be characterised as health\npromoting, our work extends the concept to consider\nhow therapeutic landscapes might be pro-actively\nconstructed. That is, by drawing on those aspects of\nplaces that are seen to promote health and well being,\nour study illustrates how it might be possible to develop\neveryday places that promote the physical and mental\nwell being of older people.\nParticularly pertinent to our work is Palka\u2019s study of\nwilderness national parks and their role as places of\nhealing. In Palka\u2019s view, a \u2018therapeutic landscape\u2019 can be\nseen as a place that \u2018promotes wellness by facilitating\nrelaxation and restoration and enhancing some combi-\nnation of physical, mental and spiritual healing\u2019 (1999,\n30). Hence, the goal becomes one of providing\ntherapeutic environments for people who have experi-\nenced physical or mental ill-health or to serve as a\npreventative measure in our modern, high-stress society.\nA more subtle reading of Palka\u2019s work highlights two\nkey elements that underlie the concept: firstly, the\ntherapeutic effects of direct physical engagement with\nthe environment (being in or on the landscape); and\nsecondly, the aesthetic and therapeutic benefits of\nmentally engaging with the environment (i.e. through\nsensory experiences and people\u2019s sense of place). Whilst\nneither of these elements is mutually exclusive, they do,\nnevertheless, illustrate two distinct ways in which the\nlandscape can be experienced. In terms of the therapeu-\ntic effects of gardening this reflects a space in which the\nact of cultivation becomes a form of literally \u2018mixing\nwith the earth\u2019 (Bhatti & Church, 2000) in a haven\nremoved from the wider public world in which most\nsocial activities are performed. Such activity involves a\nunique personal engagement with nature that derives\nfrom the sights, sounds and smells generated within the\ngarden environment.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nC. Milligan et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 58 (2004) 1781\u201317931784Of particular interest to our study is the way in which\nthe interrelationships between gardeners and their\nenvironment may be seen to contribute to an improved\nquality of life and mental well being. Should this be the\ncase, it highlights one practical way in which it may be\npossible to develop a \u2018therapeutic landscape\u2019.Methods\nThe study was undertaken in Carlisle, a city in the\nNorthwest of England where 23% of its population is\naged over 60 years of age and which has some of the\nmost deprived neighbourhoods in northern England\n(ONS, 2001). As such, it faces some significant\nchallenges in meeting the needs of its older people and\npromoting healthy aging. A key aspect of the study was\nto investigate the potential benefits of gardening activity\nfor older people, and in particular, to examine the extent\nto which communal gardening activity on allotment sites\nmay be beneficial to the health and mental well being of\nolder people.3\nThe study recruited participants for the project\nthrough General Practitioner lists. The only inclusion\ncriteria were that potential participants were aged over\n65, not mentally confused and had some physical\nmobility (i.e. they were able to walk at least 100 yards\nwithout support). Though 30 participants were initially\nrecruited to take part in the gardening activity, 10\ndropped out in the first few weeks of the project due to\neither their own ill-health or that of their partners. This\nemphasises the problem of high levels of attrition when\nundertaking longitudinal research with older people\u2014an\nissue we discuss in a forthcoming methodological\npaper.4 One further participant withdrew due to\npersonality differences between himself and other\nparticipants in the project. Hence our discussion is\nbased on data gathered from those 19 participants who\ntook an active part in communal gardening. Thirteen of\nthese participants were male and six were female, with\nages ranging between 65 and 79 (median age\u201470 years).\nThree further participants withdrew approximately 3\nmonths into the project due to: (i) personal ill-health; (ii)\nspousal ill-health; and (iii) personality differences.\nDuring a 9-month period (between March and Novem-\nber 2002), the participants gardened on two allotment\nsites, provided free of charge by Carlisle City Council,3This paper draws on a larger study that considers the impact\nof different types of activity for the health and well-being of\nolder people. In this paper, we focus specifically on issues that\nrelate to the role of landscape, gardens and the gardening\nactivities on those participating in the study. The impact of\ndifferent types of activity and comparisons between them are\naddressed elsewhere (contact authors for details).\n4Contact corresponding author for further details.with the support of a full-time, qualified gardener\n(employed by the project).5 The gardener played a key\nrole in setting up and facilitating the development of the\ngroup, providing initial leadership, advice and support,\nand also acting as an arbiter in minor disputes until the\ngroup began to cohere. The gardener\u2019s role was entirely\ndistinct from that of the researchers\u2019.\nThe allotment sites covered a total of approximately\n450m2. The choice of site was based on proximity to the\nparticipant\u2019s own home. All equipment, seeds and plants\nwere provided by the project, though participants made\ntheir own decisions about what they would prefer to\ngrow. Participants could also choose whether to garden\ncommunally with others on the allotment site or to\nsubdivide the allotment into smaller, individual plots. In\nfact, most opted to garden communally, though a few\nparticipants also chose to garden small individual plots\n(the size of these individual plots was entirely of their\nown choosing).\nThe study used a mixed methodology with the key\nemphasis on ethnography. Prior to the beginning of the\ngardening project, we undertook a focus group with 10\nparticipants, followed by semi-structured interviews\nwith 10 additional participants. Here, we were con-\ncerned to explore participants\u2019 self-assessment of their\nphysical and mental health status and how older people\ndefine health and well being. We were also concerned to\nexplore what kinds of factors appeared to have affected\ntheir health and well being as well as the extent of their\nphysical and mental activities (including gardening), and\ntheir social networks. Finally, we explored the extent to\nwhich nature, natural landscapes and the local environ-\nment affected their everyday lives. At the end of the\nproject, we conducted a second phase of focus group\nand interviews. Here, we were concerned to discuss the\nexperience of communal gardening and extent to which\nthis activity may have impacted on the health and well\nbeing of our participants. Over the 9-month period of\nthe project, we also gathered longitudinal data about\nparticipants\u2019 activities and factors affecting their health\nand well being through the completion of standard\nweekly diaries. The diaries asked three structured\nquestions about their health and well being over the\ncourse of the week, with additional unstructured space\nin which participants were encouraged to discuss: (i)\nevents over the course of the week that may have\nimpacted on their health and well being; and (ii) their\nthoughts and perceptions about their gardening activity.\nThe diaries were supplemented by regular visual and\nobservational data gathered by the project researcher5 It is worth noting that while the gardener\u2019s support was vital\nin facilitating the development of a cohesive group of older\ngardeners, at the end of the 9-month project, despite the\nwithdrawal of the gardener\u2019s support, many of the participants\nhave continued to garden communally on the allotment site.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nC. Milligan et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 58 (2004) 1781\u20131793 1785along with regular verbal and written reports from the\ngardener in relation to the gardening activities. All data\nwere transcribed in full and analysed using a grounded\ntheory approach with Atlas\/ti qualitative software.\nAs with many studies that focus on the health of older\npeople, we experienced initial problems of recruitment\nand attrition due to poor health.6 Despite these\nproblems, we gathered a vast amount of rich data\nsurrounding participants\u2019 activities over a 9-month\nperiod. These data yielded some important insights into\nthe ways in which the landscape and gardening activities\ncontribute to the health and well being of older people.Landscape and healthy aging\nOur experience of landscape through the senses is\ninseparable from the social and psychological context of\nthat experience. As Rohde and Kendle (1994) maintain,\nhowever, older people respond differently to aspects of\nthe outdoor environment than do young people. Under-\nstanding how older people experience landscape is\ncrucial if we are to have a clearer insight into how we\nmight create environments conducive to their physical\nand mental well being.\nThere is a deep-rooted notion in contemporary\nwestern society that contact with the nature and the\nnatural landscape affords humans a range of personal,\nsocial and health benefits (Parry-Jones, 1990). Herzog\nand Barnes (1999) point to two clear restorative benefits\nof the natural landscape. First, it is seen to provide a site\nfor reflection, where the pleasure taken from the\naesthetic beauty of the natural environment provides a\nsetting in which it is possible to think through immediate\nand unresolved problems. Second, the natural landscape\nis viewed as offering a setting for attentional recovery\nfrom the fatigue of those demands placed upon the\nindividual by the everyday environment. These natural\nsettings are seen as distinct from the everyday lived\nenvironment of the urban dweller in that they are rich\nand coherent ecosystems to both observe and explore.\nThat is, they give a sense of order and relatedness at\nboth perceptual and conceptual levels such that they\n\u2018put pieces together in a meaningful whole\u2019 (Parry-Jones,\n1990, p. 8) encompassing both the imagined as well as\nthe surveyed scene. Such landscapes offer an array of\nroles that relate to the setting, from walking and\nclimbing, to observing or peaceful meditation. Hence,\nnot only might older people gain physical health benefits\nfrom their active engagement with the landscape, they\nmay also derive considerable psychological benefit from\ntheir passive involvement with nature (Ulrich &\nAddoms, 1981).6Methodological issues associated with undertaking a study\nof this kind are addressed in a further paper.Knopf (1987) points to four potential benefits of the\nnatural landscape: nature restores; it facilitates compe-\ntence building; it carries symbols that affirm the culture\nor self; and it offers a pleasing diversion. These themes\nwere evident in our participants\u2019 responses to the natural\nlandscape and its impact on their mental well being. In\nparticular, such landscapes were associated with feelings\nof peace and tranquillity, or exhilaration. As Florence\n(73)7 explained, \u2018I think if you get to the top of a mountain\nit\u2019s very exhilaratingyYou\u2019ve a wonderful feeling. You\ncan\u2019t really explain it.\u2019 Inevitably, only limited number\nof participants were physically fit enough to climb\nmountains, yet this in no way diminished their\nemotional attachment to the landscape. For some, the\nlandscape was experienced passively\u2014internalised as a\nscenic gaze that impacted on their emotional psyche in\nways that were both positive and beneficial. As Avril\n(73) puts it, \u2018I enjoy, you know, seeing the acorns and the\ndifferent seasons, and when you see the first green shoots,\nthe snowdrops starting, and you have the berries on the\ntrees\u2019. Such responses illustrate the positive impact that\ngrowth and renewal of the natural landscape can have\non an individual\u2019s sense of well being. For others, the\nnatural landscape was intimately linked to the develop-\nment of new hobbies\u2014such as painting and photo-\ngraphy\u2014that participants had begun to explore on\nretirement as a means of \u2018getting out\u2019 and enjoying the\npeace and calm of the countryside.\nNatural landscapes were also intimately linked to\nolder people\u2019s social interactions in ways that can be\ncentral to relieving the stresses of everyday life. As Ted\n(69) explained, \u2018Most mornings I take the dog for a walk\nout. There\u2019s a clique of us, we meet up by the riveryI go\nfor a walk, maybe three or four miles\u2014it\u2019s a leisurely\nwalk, you know? And we put the world to rights\u2014it\u2019s a\ngood stress reliever I would say.\u2019 Ted went on to\nemphasise the importance of the natural landscape in\ncontributing to his sense of well being, noting, \u2018Around\nthe river is definitely better, yeah. Along the streets, that\nwould be no fun at all\u2014particularly with the traffic. I very\nrarely come up town.\u2019 In this way, the landscape is seen\nto be experienced in a relational sense, where the\naesthetics of a pleasing and tranquil environment form\na significant element of the therapeutic qualities of the\nsocial encounter. The restorative effects of the landscape\nare thus enhanced by the presence of natural features\n(Parry-Jones, 1990).\nIn contrast, many urban settings are deficient in\nrestorative features. The positive association between\nnatural landscape and mental well being, as expressed by\nour participants, contrasted sharply with responses to\nthe built urban and often deprived localities in which\nthey were resident. In particular, they noted the negative7Figure in brackets following a participant\u2019s pseudonym\nrepresents his\/her age at the time of research.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nC. Milligan et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 58 (2004) 1781\u201317931786effect on older people\u2019s sense of well being and safety of\nneighbourhoods where rubbish, graffiti and youth crime\nwere the norm. As Annette (74) commented, \u2018They\u2019ve\nbrought people in from Raffles8 and different parts who\ndon\u2019t appreciate your garden, you know. And they bang at\nyour door and throw things at your windows and cars are\nbroken into a lot up hereyI wouldn\u2019t go out on my own at\nnight\u2014never! The buses come up Lightfoot Drive and they\nthrow stones at them, sticks\u2014anything\u2014I wouldn\u2019t trust\nthem not to hit me.\u2019\nThe overall impact of these deprived urban areas on\nparticipants\u2014in particular, female participants\u2014was\none of retreat from the local urban landscape, particu-\nlarly at specific times of the day or year. Both men and\nwomen also highlighted their avoidance of public\ntransport around those times when school children were\nlikely to frequent these services. Early darkness or poor\nweather further reduced opportunities for social inter-\naction outside the home space unless door-to-door\ntransport was available.\nOlder people and domestic gardens\u2014haven or heartache?\nBhatti and Church (2000, p. 185) maintain that \u2018the\ngarden provides a lens for understanding the creation of\nmicro-social worlds that are an important part of an\nindividual response to tensions and conflicts in wider\nsociety\u2019. This was reflected in the way in which\nparticipants described the urban landscape as depressing\nor threatening to older people, and emphasised the\nextent to which the domestic garden was seen to play an\nimportant role in their lives. In particular, individuals\nhighlighted the importance of having some private space\nthat they could \u2018step out to\u2019 to enjoy the peace and\ntranquillity of nature that was removed from the often\npoor local environments in which their homes were\nsituated. This signals the importance of not only the\nactive components of interaction with the domestic\ngarden (e.g. gardening activity) but also the passive\nengagement that may involve simply sitting, looking or\nwalking in it. As Alma (79) put it, \u2018Just being on my own,\n[in the garden] sort of, the quietness, and seeing every-\nthing sprouting, seeing the flowers come out and the daffs\ncome out. I think it\u2019s just lovely.\u2019\nTuan (1990) identified the importance of gardens in\nthe construction of a domestic \u2018sense of place\u2019. We\nwould go further, supporting the notion that for some\nolder people, the garden represents a place of ontolo-\ngical security, reinforcing the notion of the \u2018home as\nhaven\u2019\u2014a safe space to which older people can retreat\nfrom the conflicts and perceived threats of the urban\nlandscape (Saunders, 1986; Dupuis & Thorns, 1998;\nBhatti, 1999). As Annette (74) explained, \u2018Your home is8A district of the city with a local reputation for crime and\nvandalism.quite important, you know, to have a bit of space at the\nback and so on.\u2019 The experience of the garden itself was\nvariously described as creating feelings of relaxation,\npeace and tranquillity\u2014so contributing to those feelings\nof well being characteristic of the \u2018therapeutic land-\nscape\u2019. As Godfrey (65) puts it, \u2018I think the garden\u2019s quite\nimportant because it\u2019s the environment we look to give us a\nbit of relaxation\u2019. This is further illustrated in the brief\ninterview excerpt with Tilly (73) below:\nI: We talked about things that make you feel calm and\ncontented\u2014how does the garden make you feel?\nR: Just like that\u2014if the sun shines you can just sit\u2014I\nhave nice little sitting placesy\nI: How would you feel if you didn\u2019t have a garden?\nR: Err, I don\u2019t know, lost.\nTilly\u2019s response illustrates the importance of being in\nthe garden, a lived experience which is a form of\nemplacement from which the individual engages with the\nworld (Bhatti, 1999). Of particular significance is the\nsensory engagement with the garden and nature; as\nillustrated by the following quotes, participants made\nnumerous references to importance of colour, smells,\nflowers, birdsong, etc.:\nThe garden\u2019s filled with bluebells when the bluebells are\nout. Just now its absolutely filled with snowdrops and\nthere\u2019ll be the daffodilsysometimes I grow beans,\nthey\u2019re decorative, you know, they\u2019ve got lovely red\nflowers [Florence (73)]\nI love perfume and all flowers, but I love the perfume. I\nlike any rose [Ethel (80)]\nI\u2019ve got southernwood, that\u2019s beautifulywhen you\ntouch it, it smells beautiful [Ralph (72)]\nI love nature, we have got loads of birds in our garden.\nThe thrush was singing this morning [Tilly (73)]\nIn this way, gardens can be seen to offer powerful\nsettings for human life, reflecting our own sensual and\npersonal experiences.\nFor others, activity in the garden was less associated\nwith a place to relax and be content and more as a place\nof social interaction between neighbours and passing\nmembers of the local community. As Avril (73) noted,\n\u2018If I wasn\u2019t going out an afternoon, you could have quite a\nnice time hoeing away. If I was at the front, people would\nbe commenting and talkingythe social side is important\nwith the garden\u2019. Here, while the boundaries between the\nhome and the wider urban landscape are clearly\ndelineated, the social encounter experienced by being\nin the domestic garden further illustrates that dynamic\ninterconnection between public space and the private\nspace of the home that geographers (e.g. Tivers, 1987;\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nC. Milligan et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 58 (2004) 1781\u20131793 1787Massey, 1996; Hardill, Green, & Dudleston, 1997;\nMilligan, 2000) have been concerned to explore.\nHence, the domestic garden is valued by older people\nas offering a secure space, away from the perceived\nthreats of the wider urban landscape, that can be\nexperienced in both and active and passive ways. Within\nthe garden, individual, environmental and societal\nfactors can be seen to combine to facilitate relaxation\nand the restorative effects characteristic of the \u2018ther-\napeutic landscape\u2019.\nAdapting for older age\u2014the \u2018half hour garden\u2019\nWhile domestic gardens were almost universally seen\nby participants as conducive to their mental well being,\nthere was also an acknowledgement that advancing age\ncould limit their capacity to cope with the garden, which\nin turn can lead to frustration and\/or depression with\nnegative impacts on an individual\u2019s mental well being.\nAs an extension of the home, importance is attached to\nthe ability to maintain a neat and tidy garden. As Sefton\n(80) commented, \u2018I like to keep it tidy, keep the grass\nshort, keep a good appearance\u2019\u2014a factor that in turn\nmay be viewed as a reflection of the ability to manage\nthe home itself. For some participants, an unmanageable\ngarden was a cause of distress and concern that had two\npossible outcomes:(i) the inability to cope with the upkeep of the garden\nwould either render the older person reliant on a\nfamily member or neighbour for help in the heavier\ngardening tasks\u2014so reducing his\/her independence\n(a factor that was almost universally seen by the\nparticipants as critical to their definition of health);\nor(ii) the inability to cope with the garden would result in\nthe older person having to move from his\/her\npresent home to sheltered housing, a flat or similar\ndwelling with no garden to upkeep.Other people within our study, however, were actively\nengaging with the knowledge that the aging process\ncould bring with it a decline in their physical abilities by\n\u2018preparing for old age\u2019. These individuals were adapting\ntheir garden spaces to minimise the physical activity\nrequired for some forms of gardening\u2014eliminating\nvegetable crops and shrubs that required significant\nlevels of upkeep and replacing with tubs, hanging\nbaskets, lawned or paved areas that required minimal\nupkeep. This process of adaptation was neatly sum-\nmarised by Ralph (72), who commented:\nI\u2019ve got it [the garden] slabbed and it\u2019s in squares right\nthe way round. I\u2019ve done this about four years ago,\nwhen I knew this [old age] was coming on and I said,\nwell I\u2019m going to get it done and make it my \u2018half hourgarden\u2019. I\u2019ve got my greenhouse and I\u2019ve got plants in it\ncoming through and then they\u2019re just to plant out. Once\nthey\u2019re planted out, the garden bit\u2019s done. That\u2019s the\nway I look at it like.\nFor those with the financial resources to do so,\nengaging a gardener for a few hours a week may provide\nan alternative option\u2014enabling them to retain their\ngarden without the need to redesign it. However, only\none of our gardening participants engaged hired help for\nthe garden, indicating that this is a limited option for\nolder people who may be living in deprived areas and\/or\nsurviving on very limited incomes.\nFor those older people whose garden has become an\nincreasing problem to manage, communal gardening\nmay provide one solution to maintaining the mental,\nphysical and social experience of gardens and gardening\nactivity. Hence, in this last section we examine the extent\nto which communal gardening on allotment sites has the\npotential to contribute to the health and mental well\nbeing of older people.Cultivating health: allotment gardening for older people\nGardens (and hence gardening activity) are not\nlimited to our homes but expand across our towns and\ncities to become part of the neighbourhood encom-\npassed in the form of public and corporate gardens,\nparks and allotments or community gardens. Recent\nchanges in the role of allotment gardening have seen it\nshift from being a post-war form of social welfare\nprovision to a type of leisure activity (Wiltshire &\nAzuma, 2000). Wiltshire and Azuma argue that the\nincreasing popularity of allotment gardening can be seen\nas a growing reaction to the privatisation of public life\nand the need for spaces that support social contact and\nactive participation. In this respect, the promotion of\nallotment gardening can be seen to meet a multiple\nagenda. Not only might it provide a means through\nwhich to promote the health and well being of older\npeople; but where allotment officers actively encourage a\nmix of abilities on available sites, the benefits arising\nfrom the social interaction inherent within such com-\nmunal gardening activity also have a powerful potential\nto address the UK government\u2019s social exclusion\nagenda. One further benefit of communal gardening\nactivity is its direct contribution to the promotion of\nneighbourhood renewal and active citizenship. How-\never, while both the UK government and the Local\nGovernment Association recognise the potential con-\ntribution of allotments to both the government\u2019s\nsustainable development agenda and increased social\ncapital (Cmd 199798, 1998), there is also potential\nconflict arising from government commitment to build\non brownfield rather than greenfield sites; hence urban\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nC. Milligan et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 58 (2004) 1781\u201317931788allotments are increasingly coming under pressure from\nthose wishing to develop these sites for housing or\ncommercial uses. Nationwide, there has been a steady\nreduction in the number of allotment plots since the\nsecond world war, from 1.5 million to 30,000 in 2001\u2014a\nthird of which have been lost since 1978 (Arnot, 2001).\nCommunal gardening versus the \u2018lone gardener\u2019\nIn the Carlisle study, one of the most important\nelements of the allotment gardening activity was the\ndevelopment of a peer group that worked communally,\nsharing knowledge and skills and benefiting from\nenhanced social interaction. While many older people\nmay be keen or interested gardeners, declining physical\nfitness can render them unable to undertake the heavier\ntasks associated with gardening activity. Hence, garden-\ning communally offered an opportunity to bring\ntogether a peer group that enabled each individual\nwithin the group to maximise his or her skills and\nabilities to the benefit of the group as a whole. As Paul\n(66) puts it, \u2018some of them couldn\u2019t manage a full\nallotment on their own, but within the group we\u2019ve got\npeople who can dig and some who go down for a chat a get\na little fork and take some weeds out and water some\nthings\u2019. While some participants initially set out as \u2018lone\u2019\ngardeners intent on developing their own segregated\nplot, it quickly became evident that if the club was to\nfacilitate the needs of all its members, it would require\nparticipants to work together, undertaking communal\ngardening activity in which each participant gardened\naccording to their level of ability. As Terry (69) puts it,\n\u2018There was one lad thereyhe started his little plot on his\nown, but then there was a lot of people who weren\u2019t really\nphysically fit enough to do the work. So then it was just a\nmatter of helping them, so everybody just ended up piling\ninto the plot, and that seemed to work. It was communal,\neveryone helped each other. We carried some through\nwho\u2019ve never done gardening before on the vegetable side,\nso we passed that on a bit.\u2019 Evidence of the group\u2019s\nsupportiveness was also demonstrated through indivi-\nduals\u2019 commitment to collective activity and decision\nmaking\u2014participants regarded others as being valuable\nmembers of the team irrespective of their level of ability\nand each was seen as having something positive to\ncontribute to the group dynamic.\nOf course not all individuals find it easy to function as\na member of a team, and in our study, two individuals\nleft the group as a result of the difficulties they faced in\nworking communally. As Terry (69) explained, \u2018\u2018the\ndifference with \u2018Nigel\u2019 was he wasn\u2019t a team member and\nit had to work as a team, definitely. Even \u2018Fred\u2019, he was a\nloner to start with, but now he\u2019s become a team member,\nyou know? The other lad\u2014well there was no way he was\never going to be a team member.\u2019\u2019 Yet despite the group\u2019s\ndecision to work the allotment communally, it was stillable to facilitate those who preferred to garden alone, or\nwho wanted some space of their own to express their\nindividuality. While on the whole this approach worked,\nit was not always without setbacks. Alma (79), in\nparticular, noted in her diary that, \u2018\u2018In my absence \u2018Fred\u2019\nfilled my prepared flower beds with plants from his garden,\nwhich was most disappointing. He wasn\u2019t there to see my\nshocked face. So I started to clear a new plot and make it\nready for planting so I could put in plants of my own\nchoice\u2019\u2019. Whilst acknowledging that Fred (77) was \u2018only\ntrying to be helpful\u2019, Alma went on to say, \u2018I like putting\nthem [plants] into the earthydoing it myselfyI felt quite\npossessive about it\u2019. This possessiveness was evident in\nthe considerable pains she took to individualise and\ndefine her new plot by installing low fencing and\nplanting up \u2018her patch\u2019 with flowers of her own choice.\nDespite her wish to \u2018garden alone\u2019, however, Alma also\nstressed the importance of being able to work near the\ngroup and \u2018enjoy the banter\u2019.\nAn important aspect of the communal gardening\nactivity has been the development of social networks. As\nStuart (66) noted, \u2018apart from the enjoyment of the\nallotment and the trips out, we have gained new friends.\nThere have been a number of situations where members\nhave helped each other in activities outside the club work.\u2019\nSocial networks can act as buffers to stressors, providing\na structure for acquiring skills and enhancing a person\u2019s\nsense of self. Their efficacy lies in being based on norms\nof supportiveness and reciprocity, where such reciprocal\nrelationships and support mechanisms are of the\nindividual\u2019s own making (Nolan, 1995; Langford et al.,\n1997). As Paul (66) explained, \u2018I\u2019ve chosen to stay with\nthe group because if I want to go away for a week someone\nelse will do ityyou can go in and do some work and bring\nsome stuff away or you can stop away for a bit\u2019. Indeed,\nBecker et al. (1998) maintain that there is a positive link\nbetween reduced hospitalisation, enhanced quality of life\nand the supportiveness of social networks. Given that\nallotments are widely available and inexpensive to rent,\nwe would argue that, as sites of communal gardening\nactivity for older people, they not only offer settings for\nthe location of social networks and activities that\npromote wellness (Gesler, 1993; Palka, 1999), but also\na potential route into mainstream social networks that\ncan have an inclusive, protective and preventative\nfunction.\nThe effects and experience of gardening\nWhile there are clear benefits to be gained for the\nhealth and well being of older people from communal\ngardening activity, there is also a deeper meaning to\ngardening to be found in the gardener\u2019s direct engage-\nment in gardening activity and his or her responses to its\nprogress (Lewis, 1995). Gardening activity requires both\nan intimate and direct involvement by the individual.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nC. Milligan et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 58 (2004) 1781\u20131793 1789Planning, digging, planting, watering and harvesting are\nnot passive activities and cannot be undertaken without\nsome level of emotional commitment. Participants in\nour study commented both on \u2018the marvel of nature\u2019, in\nparticular, their pleasure at witnessing the daily changes\nin the growth of the plants on the allotment, the\ncreativity involved and the \u2018satisfaction of the work\u2019,\nenjoying \u2018the hands on thing\u2019, so expressing both the\ntangible and intangible personal rewards gained from\ntheir gardening activity. In particular, they expressed\ngreat pleasure and satisfaction in planting, seeing things\ngrow and witnessing the results of their communal\nlabours. As Avril (73) commented, \u2018I was amazed at how\nthe crops have grown at our allotment since my last visit\u2014\ndelicious potatoes and lovely fresh lettuce\u2019, Alma (79) also\nremarked, \u2018I came away with potatoes and lettuce, onions\nand mint\u2014all our own home-grown produce\u2019. Alma\nfurther commented, \u2018I know I\u2019m very limited in what I\ncan do, but I think getting the results gives you a boostyI\ntake pride in the results\u2019. By responding to care or\nneglect, plants can be seen to bestow non-discriminatory\nrewards on their carer, offering an immediate reinforce-\nment of a sense of personal agency, but without the\nburden of an interpersonal relationship (Stoneham,\n1999).\nWhile plants require nurturing in order to grow and\nremain healthy, the group also acted to nurture those\nless able. As Avril (73) noted, \u2018\u2018two hours was enough for\nmeyI was tired then and they\u2019d get a chair out and say\n\u2018sit down Avril\u2019 and they\u2019d have a chair and sit down as\nwell\u2019\u2019. Stuart (66), who experienced a wrist injury during\nthe course of the project also explained, \u2018I have found the\nother members of the group very helpful while I have been\nslightly handicapped. This is something I have found from\nthe start. All the group get on very well together and help\neach other.\u2019 The reciprocal support offered by the group\nenabled members to ensure the plants were nurtured and\nthe allotment was maintained despite individual breaks\nfrom the activity caused either by illness, injury or\nholidays. Group support amongst older gardeners may\nthus help to prevent the feeling of being overwhelmed by\nthe garden during periods of poor health or extended\nabsence from the home and facilitate their ability and\ndesire to return to the garden at a later date.\nThe beneficial effect of communal gardening as social,\nemotional and experiential activity is perhaps best\nsummed up by Avril (73) who noted, \u2018I think it\n[gardening] is therapeuticywhen I\u2019ve been round and\nseen all the things that are growing and talked to other\npeople, I feel better when I come back [home].\u2019Profiling the older gardener\nIn their work on gardening activity amongst middle-\naged women in New Zealand, Kidd, Pachana, andAlpass (2000) distinguish three distinct groups of\ngardener profiles:\n1. \u2018Happy healthy gardeners\u2019 who are well educated\nwith few physical limitations and who work long\nhours outside of the home. These people love\ngardening, but as hobby rather than as primary\nfocus of life. Such gardeners have learned the art of\nrelaxing in the garden;\n2. \u2018Even-keeled gardeners\u2019 who take a balanced ap-\nproach, mixing both active and passive gardening\nbehaviours and who gain an average score on heath\nmeasures; and\n3. \u2018Introspective gardeners\u2019 who have lower educational\nlevels and more physical limitations and who work\nfewer hours outside of the home. These people take\non worries but are less willing to share them and are\noften open to depression. For many of this group,\ngardening is viewed as a \u2018lifesaver\u2019\u2014an essential way\nof preserving their mental stability.\nThese gardener profiles offer some useful insights into\nthose whose gardening activity is undertaken as a lone\noccupation. However, not all gardening occurs as a lone\nactivity, hence, there is a need to develop this framework\nfurther to account for those whose gardening takes place\nas a group activity and whose \u2018profile\u2019 is mediated by the\ngroup dynamic. Based on our study, we would suggest\nthat age creates an additional dimension to the gardener\nprofile that increases the complexity of this framework.\nWe would also point out that additional factors such as\ngender, culture and ethnicity are also likely to compli-\ncate attempts to develop gardener profiles, though\nfurther work would be required to explore these issues.\nBased on our study of gardening amongst older\npeople, we would identify a fourth \u2018gardener profile\u2019\u2014\nthat of the \u2018communal gardener\u2019. Within this profile,\nstrands of the \u2018happy healthy\u2019, \u2018even-keeled\u2019 and\n\u2018introspective\u2019 gardeners can be identified, but each are\nmediated by both age and the communal gardening\nexperience. So, e.g. while \u2018introspective gardeners\u2019 could\nclearly be identified within our gardening group,\ngrowing physical limitations arising from the aging\nprocess had been critical in their decision to participate\nin the communal gardening activity. Here, they felt they\nwould benefit from the support of the group in ways that\nwould enable them to continue gardening. Despite\nworking within the group, these individuals tended to\nclearly demarcate their own \u2018patch\u2019, but as the following\ninterview excerpt illustrates, often as the most knowl-\nedgeable of the gardeners, they found themselves drawn\ninto the group activity as others sought their expertise\nand advice:\nInterviewer: What was the attraction of the gardening\ngroup for you?\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nC. Milligan et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 58 (2004) 1781\u201317931790Fred (77): It\u2019s getting to meet people and share ideas\nand whatever, you know?\nBarbara (67): And passing some advice on, because we\ngot quite a few tips from \u2018Fred\u2019 didn\u2019t we, over the\nsummer?\nFeeling useful and needed was an important element\nof the group dynamic and was seen to contribute to an\nincrease in the levels of satisfaction achieved from the\ngroup activity by some of the \u2018introspective gardeners\u2019.\nTwo other traits were clearly identifiable within the\nbroader communal gardener profile. The \u2018first time\ngardener\u2019 had little gardening experience and was keen\nto learn from more knowledgeable peers. These indivi-\nduals were happy to garden as part of a group, feeling\n\u2018safe\u2019 and supported in undertaking a relatively new\nactivity whilst benefiting from the pooled knowledge of\nthe wider group. In addition, we identified what we refer\nto as the \u2018collective gardeners\u2019, those individuals who\nhad been used to gardening as part of a team (largely\nwith a spouse or other family member) and who, as a\nresult, had few problems in adapting to gardening as a\ngroup activity. The \u2018communal gardener\u2019 is thus\ncharacterised by an internal fluidity that facilitates a\nshift between gardener profiles as individuals become\ninfluenced by the group dynamic.Discussion\nOh, it\u2019s been great. I think if I hadn\u2019t had that to look\nforward to I\u2019d have been much more depressed and\nweary than I\u2019ve beenyIt\u2019s been my main activity since\nI\u2019ve had to give things up through being limited [Avril\n(73)].\nIn considering how landscape, gardens and gardening\nactivity may contribute to the health and mental well\nbeing of older people, we have turned to the concept of\nthe \u2018therapeutic landscape\u2019. Based on our discussion of\nlandscape, gardens and gardening activity amongst\nolder people in northern England, we have illustrated\nthat the concept can be seen to acting at various scales in\nthree specific ways.\nFirstly, older people experience natural and built\nlandscapes in very different ways. While the natural\nlandscape was seen to contribute positively, in both\nactive and passive ways, on their mental well being,\nthe experience of the everyday built landscapes in which\nour participants were resident closely reflected the\nfindings of other geographical studies which point to a\nheightened \u2018fear of crime\u2019 amongst older people (Pain,\n1997). One outcome of this was the importance attached\nto the home and the domestic garden as a site of\nrelaxation and ontological security\u2014the echoing thoserestorative features characteristic of the \u2018therapeutic\nlandscape\u2019.\nSecondly, allotments, as sites for the development of\ncommunal gardening activity, were seen to contribute to\nthe social inclusion of older people in that they offered a\nmeans of combating social isolation and promoting the\ndevelopment of their social networks. Allotments are,\nthus, seen as relational spaces in which gardening, as a\nsocial activity, acts as a mechanism for overcoming\nsocial exclusion.\nThirdly, there is a deeper meaning to communal\ngardening activity, one that operates at an emotional\nand experiential level. Not only did participants gain a\nsense of achievement, satisfaction and aesthetic pleasure\nfrom their engagement with nature, but where commu-\nnal gardening activity occurred the qualities required to\nsuccessfully nurture their plants were also evident in\nnurturing those less able members of the group. The\nreciprocity at work here also enabled the group to\nsupport even the more experienced gardeners, prevent-\ning them from feeling overwhelmed by the allotment\nduring periods of illness or absence.\nWe acknowledge that because our work is based on an\nintervention, it deviates from the accepted empirical\nnorms of therapeutic landscape research. Nevertheless,\nwe argue that if we are to facilitate a greater under-\nstanding of the beneficial qualities of common, dispersed\nplaces for the health and well being of people in\ncontemporary society, it is with precisely this kind of\nactivity that health geographers, using the concept,\nshould be concerned. Rather than continuing to identify\nthe specific and unique, we should begin to focus on how\nunderstandings of those aspects of place that contribute\nto health and well being (and vice versa) can be used in\npositive ways to develop therapeutic landscapes and\nplaces that actively promote health and well being.\nAt a policy level, the physical shortcomings often\nattached to the aging process means that while older\npeople continue to enjoy the domestic garden and\ngardening activity, they increasingly require support to\ncontinue doing so if the garden is to avoid being viewed\nas a depressing burden rather than a healthy pleasure to\nbe enjoyed. Declining physical ability to manage the\ngarden in later life, combined with the negative impacts\non an individual\u2019s mental well being are important issues\nthat need to be taken into account by policy makers\nwhen considering the development of programmes\naimed at supporting older people and facilitating\nhealthy aging.\nOur study has also highlighted the potential benefits\nof communal gardening activity for older people, which,\nwhen approached sympathetically, can meet the needs of\ngardeners with a significant range of abilities and\npersonal expectations. Communal gardening has parti-\ncular benefits over and above the contribution of the\nmore traditional \u2018lone\u2019 gardening to physical health. In\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nC. Milligan et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 58 (2004) 1781\u20131793 1791particular, we have illustrated its potential for develop-\ning the social networks of older people and offering\na place to share skills while at the same time contribut-\ning to an improvement in the local environment.\nAllotments are widespread across the UK, and where\navailable, are relatively inexpensive. Sensitively devel-\noped, they have the potential to make a significant\ncontribution to the healthy aging agenda through\ncommunal gardening.\nWhile gardening may offer a useful tool for improving\nthe physical health and mental well being of older\npeople, there is also a need for sensitivity and flexibility\nin how this is approached. It is clear that communal\ngardening will not suit all; hence healthy gardening\ninterventions for older people need to be sensitively\ntailored to individual need. That is, offering not only\ncommunal spaces for gardening, but also support within\nthe home\u2014e.g. through adaptive gardening that will\nenable older people to continue to care for existing\ngardens, or through the development of small dedicated\nspaces within the home (or indeed sheltered housing) in\nthe form of raised beds, with occasional support either\nfrom a dedicated gardener, or from other older (fitter)\npeople. The introduction of flexible \u2018supported garden-\ning\u2019 schemes aimed at maintaining older people\u2019s ability\nto continue to garden within their homes, or through the\nprovision of small domestic garden plots within shel-\ntered accommodation may provide some alternative\nways in which healthy and active aging can be\npromoted.Acknowledgements\nWe would like to acknowledge the contribution of\nthe other members of the project team including\nDr. Rebecca Wagstaff (Director of Public Health,\nEden Valley PCT), Jessica Riddle (Age Concern) and\nElizabeth Allnutt (Allotments Officer, Carlisle City\nCouncil).
