INTRODUCTION.\nThe nuclide 128Xe is in a region of the nuclear chart which is rich in nuclear structure and\nprovides a testing ground to examine the interplay between triaxial and axially-deformed\nnuclear shapes. A systematic study of the shapes of ground, and neutron and proton s-bands\nacross the Xe chain from A=118 to 130 [1] indicates ground-state deformation changing\nfrom prolate in A=118-126 to oblate in A=130 with the neutron s-band essentially following\nthe same trend but oblate shapes being favoured for A>124. The proton s-band however\nconsistently favours a prolate shape. The total routhian surface calculations [1] for 128Xe are\ncompatible with other interpretations based on the O(6) limit of the interacting boson model\n[2] in suggesting a triaxial shape for the ground-state. This is supported by the observation\nof the \u03b3-band at the relatively low excitation energy of 969 keV [3] indicating the softness\nof 128Xe with respect to \u03b3-excitations and the necessity of including the triaxial degree of\nfreedom in any theoretical approach.\nIt is therefore somewhat surprising that 128Xe is known to have a Kpi=8\u2212 isomeric state\n[4] with a half-life in the nanosecond region. The K-quantum number is defined as the\nprojection of the total angular momentum onto the nuclear symmetry axis, and is a good\nquantum number only for axially symmetric deformed nuclei. Analogous, Kpi=8\u2212 isomeric\nstates have been identified in the even-Z, N=74 isotones from 13056Ba to\n140\n66Dy [5\u201311] and are\ninterpreted as being built on the 7\/2+[404]\u22979\/2\u2212[514] two-quasineutron configuration. The\nsystematics of the decay from the Kpi=8\u2212 isomeric state to the Jpi=8+ member of the yrast\nband have been discussed [9] for nuclei from 130Ba to 138Gd but prior to this work no such\ntransition had been observed for 128Xe. The observation of this transition was therefore one\nof the experimental goals. Additional motivation was to collect data in this mass region\non the \u201dgoodness\u201d of the K-quantum number in a nucleus which has strong shape-driving\neffects.\nThe experimental E(4+)\/E(2+) ratio, plotted in figure 1, shows that 128Xe with\nE(4+)\/E(2+)=2.33, lies in the middle of the so-called \u2018transitional region\u2019, where\nE(4+)\/E(2+)=2 for a pure vibrator and 3.33 for a pure rotor. In this case, it is unlikely that\nthe K-quantum number will be pure and the K-values listed in this paper have therefore been\nsimply assigned as the bandhead spin. In this work we consider the role that triaxiality plays\nin the validity of K as a good quantum number for different quasiparticle configurations,\n3\nwith particular emphasis on the Kpi=8\u2212 isomeric state. The shapes of intrinsic states have\nbeen calculated using the configuration-constrained blocking method [13] and the results\nare discussed in the context of the decay properties of the intrinsic states and the rotational\nbehaviour of bands built on them. The direct decay from the Kpi=8\u2212 isomeric state to the\n8+ member of the ground-state (K=0) band will be discussed in terms of K-mixing in both\nthe initial and final states.\n48 52 56 60 64 68\nproton number (Z)\n1.7\n1.9\n2.1\n2.3\n2.5\n2.7\n2.9\n3.1\n3.3\nE\n(4\n+\n)\/E\n(2\n+\n)\n128Xe\nFIG. 1: The experimental E(4+)\/E(2+) ratio for the even-Z, N = 74 isotones as a function of the\nproton number (data from [5\u20139, 11, 12] and the current work).\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE.\nHigh-spin states were populated using the 124Sn(9Be,5n)128Xe fusion-evaporation reaction\nat a beam energy of 58 MeV. The time profile of the 9Be beam, provided by the 14UD\nPelletron Tandem accelerator at the Australian National University, was \u223c 1 ns pulses\nseparated by 1.7 \u00b5s. These pulses were incident on a 3 mg\/cm2 thick 124Sn target which\nstopped most of the recoiling nuclei.\nTime correlated \u03b3-ray events were collected using the CAESAR array [14] comprising\nsix Compton suppressed n-type coaxial HPGe detectors placed at (\u03b8, \u03c6) angles of (48\u25e6, 0\u25e6),\n(48\u25e6, 180\u25e6), (97\u25e6, 0\u25e6), (97\u25e6, 180\u25e6), (145\u25e6, 0\u25e6) and (145\u25e6, 180\u25e6) where the z-axis is along the\nbeam and the x-axis (\u03c6=0\u25e6) is vertically upwards. Two small volume unsuppressed planar\ngermanium detectors (LEPS) were placed at (45\u25e6, 270\u25e6) and (135\u25e6, 270\u25e6). There were two\n4\ndifferent experiments:\n\u2022 A singles measurement in which the energies of \u03b3-rays and their arrival time relative to\nthe beam bunch were measured.\n\u2022 A coincidence measurement in which the energies of a pair of \u03b3-rays observed within\n\u00b1856 ns was recorded along with their time measured with respect to the rf pulse train.\nData were written to disk for subsequent off-line analysis where they were sorted [15] into\na variety of matrices and cubes. The Radware analysis software package [16] and the ANA\nprogram [17] have been used to analyse the data. Data from the singles experiment was used\nto construct 2 time-energy matrices which contained the \u03b3-ray energy on one axis and the\ntime of arrival of the \u03b3-ray on the other. One matrix contained data from the germanium\ndetectors and the other data from the LEPS detectors. In the coincidence experiment only\ndata from the germanium detectors was used to construct energy-energy-time cubes and the\nfollowing matrices: (i) a \u03b3-\u03b3-coincidence matrix where the \u03b3-rays were observed within a\ntime difference of up to \u00b143 ns, (ii) an early-delayed \u03b3-\u03b3 matrix containing events which\nhave a time difference between 44 and 784 ns, (iii) an out-of-beam matrix using events which\nhave a time difference of up to \u00b143 ns and which were measured between 50 and 1590 ns\nafter the arrival of the beam pulse, and (iv) a DCO (see below) matrix where the two axes\ncorrespond to \u03b3-rays observed in the detectors placed at \u03b8 =48\u25e6 and \u03b8 =97\u25e6.\nWhere possible, the multipolarity of a \u03b3-ray transition was obtained by using the method\nof Directional Correlations from Oriented states (DCO) [18]. Although some of the initial\nalignment can be lost following decay from an isomeric state, in the case of short (\u223cns)\nisomeric lifetimes useful conclusions can still be made from consideration of the DCO ratios.\nThe experimental DCO ratio, RDCO, is defined here as,\nRDCO =\nI\u03b31(48\n\u25e6) gated by \u03b32(97\n\u25e6)\nI\u03b31(97\n\u25e6) gated by \u03b32(48\u25e6)\n. (1)\nDCO ratios were obtained by gating only on stretched quadrupole transitions below the\ntransition of interest. \u2206J=2 and pure (\u03b4=0) \u2206J=1 transitions are expected to have RDCO\nvalues of 1 and \u223c 0.56 respectively. Mixed M1\/E2 transitions can have an RDCO value\nbetween 0.3 and 1.2 depending on \u2206J and the sign and size of the mixing ratio \u03b4.\n5\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS.\nThe total projection of the \u03b3-\u03b3-coincidence matrix confirms 128Xe as the main channel\nin the reaction with over 50% of the total cross-section. The 128Xe level scheme built in the\npresent work is shown in figure 2 and table I lists the relative intensities of \u03b3-ray transitions.\nThe intensities have been measured in the total projection of the \u03b3-\u03b3-coincidence matrix.\nSince this matrix includes data at the three detector angles, it can be considered to average\nout some of the angular distribution effect and threfore gives a measure of the relative\nintensities of the transitions. In cases where transitions are too weak to be observed in\nthis matrix or are considered to be contaminated, their intensity has been obtained from\nintensity balances in coincidence spectra. Column 5 of table I includes the measured RDCO\nvalues which for previously known [3, 4, 19] \u2206J=2 (590, 704, 775, 684, 612 keV) and pure\n(\u03b4=0) \u2206J=1 (303, 504, 846 and 1196 keV) transitions respectively average to 1.01(2) and\n0.56(2) in agreement with the expected values of 1 and \u223c 0.56. The results for previously\nknown transitions are in good agreement with earlier work [3, 4, 19].\nTABLE I: Levels and transitions obtained from the\n124Sn(9Be,5n)128Xe reaction at a beam energy of 58 MeV.

The ground-state and s- bands.\nPrior to this experiment the highest angular momentum observed in 128Xe was associated\nwith the proposed 16h\u00af state at 5570 keV [19]. In the current work, this is confirmed with\na measured RDCO value of 0.89(7) for the 954 keV depopulating transition. Figure 3 shows\na \u03b3-ray spectrum gated by the 14+\u219212+, 808 keV transition in the \u03b3-\u03b3-coincidence matrix.\nGamma-rays of energies 1033 keV, 1105 keV and 1182 keV have been assigned as the exten-\nsion of the yrast band to 22h\u00af (see figure 2). The measured RDCO values for these decays of\n0.87(9), 1.43(37) and 0.91(9), respectively, support their assignments as \u2206J=2 transitions.\nThe 1237 keV transition has been placed as feeding the Jpi=20+ level since it is not observed\nin coincidence with the 1182 keV transition.\nA Jpi=10+ state at 3364 keV feeding the 8+ member of the yrast band was proposed\nby Lo\u00a8nnroth et al. [19]. The current work has identified a band built on this state, which\nhas been extended to a proposed Jpi=16+ state at 5967 keV. These states are considered to\nbe part of the ground-state band, while the yrast states above Jpi=8+ are members of the\n10\nFIG. 2: Level scheme for 128Xe constructed in the present work.

The Kpi=2+ band.\nThe Kpi=2+ \u03b3-band built on the 969 keV state was proposed up to the Jpi=6+ level by\nNeuneyer et al. [3]. It has been observed in the current experiment and an extension to\nthe Jpi=8+ state at 2973 keV is proposed. The 2973 keV state has been observed previously\n11\nFIG. 3: Gamma-ray spectrum produced by gating on 808 keV transition in the \u03b3-\u03b3-coincidence\nmatrix.\n[3, 4, 20] but no Jpi value has been assigned to it. It decays via a 461 keV transition to the\nJpi=8+ member of the ground-state band and a 693 keV transition [3] to the Jpi=6+ member\nof the Kpi=2+ band. Neuneyer et al. [3] measured the a2 and a4 coefficients for the 461 keV\ntransition but were not able to conclude anything from the values. In the current work the\nRDCO value for the 461 keV transition has been measured as 0.87(6) and this is consistent\nwith a J \u2192 J transition. Hence a Jpi value of 8+ has been assigned. The level is assumed\nto be part of the Kpi=2+ band because of the level energy systematics and the decay to the\nJpi=6+ member of the Kpi=2+ band.\nC. The Jpi=5\u2212 state at 2228 keV.\nThe measurement of the DCO ratio for the 1196 keV transition depopulating the state\nat 2228 keV as RDCO=0.55(4) is in agreement with the J\npi=5\u2212 assignment proposed in\nprevious work [4, 19]. Figure 4(a) shows a spectrum gated by the 1196 keV transition in\nthe \u03b3-\u03b3-coincidence matrix, where transitions which form a band above the Jpi=5\u2212 state are\nidentified. No lifetime longer than 5 ns has been measured for this state.\nD. The Kpi = 8\u2212 intrinsic state at 2786 keV.\nThe intrinsic state at 2786 keV was previously assigned as Jpi=Kpi=8\u2212 following a mea-\nsurement of the g-factor by Lo\u00a8nnroth et al. [19]. Figure 4(b) shows a spectrum gated by\nthe delayed 287 keV depopulating transition in the early-delayed matrix, where a complex\n12\nFIG. 4: Gamma-ray spectra produced by gating on (a) the 1196 keV transition in the \u03b3-\u03b3-\ncoincidence matrix and (b) the 287 keV transition in the early-delayed matrix.\nband structure is identified (see figure 2). The decay paths have been linked on the basis of\nthe analysis of the \u03b3-\u03b3-coincidence matrix.\nFigure 5 shows the time spectrum obtained by gating on the 287 keV and 328 keV, and\n204 keV and 328 keV transitions in the \u03b3-\u03b3-time cube. The individual time spectra showed\nthe same exponential decay and hence were summed to improve the statistics. The best fit\nto the combined spectrum using the convolution of a Gaussian prompt response function and\na single exponential decay gives a half-life of t1\/2=73(3) ns, as shown in figure 5. This result\nis in good agreement with a previous half-life measurement of t1\/2= 63(12) ns performed by\nGoettig et al. [4], and in disagreement with Lo\u00a8nnroth et al. [19], who reported t1\/2= 83(2)\nns. Figure 6 shows a spectrum of delayed \u03b3-rays gated on the 9\u2212\u2192 8\u2212, 328 keV transition\nin the early-delayed matrix.\nTransitions observed below the Kpi=8\u2212 isomeric state are consistent with previous work\n[4, 19]. In addition, the direct decay from the Kpi = 8\u2212 isomeric state to the Jpi=8+ member\nof the yrast band proceeds via a 274 keV transition. This transition is very weak and figure 7\nshows a gate on the 775 keV transition which depopulates the yrast Jpi = 8+ state. The\nfigure shows evidence for both the 274 and 443 keV (2+\u21920+) transitions and other portions\n13\nof the spectrum show evidence of the 4+\u21922+ and 6+\u21924+ transitions.

The 287 keV transition is a stretched E2 transition\nand the 204 keV transition is of mixed M1\/E2 character.\nFIG. 6: Gamma-ray spectrum produced by gating on the 328 keV transition in the early-delayed\nmatrix.\n14\nFIG. 7: Gamma-ray spectra gated by the 775 keV transition in the out-of-beam matrix.\nE. The Jpi=9\u2212 state at 3412 keV.\nThis level is proposed on the basis of three depopulating transitions (205 and 298 keV\nto Jpi=9\u2212 states and 439 keV to the Jpi=8+ state at 2973 keV). All three transitions have\nabout the same intensity and RDCO values of 1.18(21) and 0.51(5) have been measured for\nthe latter two. The last value is consistent with the 439 keV transition being a pure (\u03b4=0)\n\u2206J=1 transition. The value for the 298 keV transition is consistent with that expected for a\nJ\u2192J transition so a Jpi value of 9\u2212 is proposed for the 3412 keV level. Values of RDCO for the\n655, 737 and 854 keV transitions of 0.91(9), 0.92(9) and 0.99(9) respectively are consistent\nwith \u2206J=2 transitions so a rotational structure above the Jpi=9\u2212 state is proposed. The\nassignment of Jpi=9\u2212 for the 3412 keV state is further strengthened by the 859 keV transition\nfrom the 4067 keV state to the 3207 keV (Jpi=9\u2212) state having an RDCO value of 1.25(13).\nThis is consistent with a \u2206J=2 transition.\nF. The Jpi=12+ state at 4087 keV.\nA new structure is proposed based on the 4087 keV level. The RDCO ratio for the 279\nkeV transition depopulating this level and feeding the yrast 12+ level is 0.64(5). This is\nconsistent with either a J \u2192 J\u22121 dipole or a mixed J \u2192 J transition, indicating possible Jpi\nvalues of 12\u00b1 or 13\u00b1. Since the J \u2192 J transition must be mixed this indicates an M1\/E2\ntransition rather than E1\/M2 and hence the Jpi=12\u2212 possibility is discarded. If the level has\n15\nTABLE II: Calculated shapes and excitation energies Ecal using the Configuration-Constrained\nBlocking Method for the ground-state and two-quasiparticle configurations in 128Xe.

No\nsuch transition is observed. If however a Jpi=13\u00b1 assignment is made, the level sequence is\nyrast and would be expected to be more strongly populated. On weighing up the arguments,\nthe Jpi=12+ assignment is preferred. Of the transitions observed within the band structure,\nthe only one where it has been possible to measure a RDCO ratio is the 320 keV transition\n(RDCO = 0.65(6)) and this is consistent with a \u2206J=1 transition. Examination of time\nspectra produced by gating on transitions above and below the 4087 keV level lead to an\nupper limit of 5 ns for the half-life of this state.\nIV. DISCUSSION.\nA. Shape driving effects due to two-quasiparticle configurations.\nThe Configuration-Constrained Blocking Method, developed by Xu et al. [13], has been\nchosen on account of its successful application to the region of interest [21]. It is based on\na non-axial Woods-Saxon potential and treats \u03b2 and \u03b3 as dynamical variables. In order\nto obtain the configuration-dependent Potential Energy Surface (PES) for a given multi-\nquasiparticle state, a process of adiabatic blocking is necessary, whereby the given orbits\nwhich are occupied by the specified quasiparticles are followed and blocked. In an axially-\nsymmetric Woods-Saxon potential, the single-particle states may be specified by the \u2126 quan-\ntum number (the spin projection onto the symmetry axis). However, for non-axial shapes,\n\u2126 is not conserved. Indeed, the only symmetries still preserved are reflection symmetry\n16\n0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30\n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\nY\n=\n\f\n2\ns\ni\nn\n(\n\r\n+\n3\n0\n)\n0.10\n0.10\n0.10 0.20\n0.10\nX = \f\n2\n\ros(\r + 30)\nFIG. 8: PES calculations for top: the 128Xe ground-state, middle: Kpi=5\u2212 and bottom: Kpi=8\u2212\nintrinsic states. The energy difference between the contours is 200 keV for all plots. Note the\ndifferent scales for the plots. Table II lists the configuration and deformation parameters associated\nwith each minimum.\n(implying conserved parity) and a rotation by 180\u25e6 about the x axis (the signature quantum\nnumber \u03b1). For even-mass nuclei \u03b1=0 or 1, and for odd-mass nuclei \u03b1=\u00b11\/2. Since the\nquantum number \u2126 is no longer good, a way to follow a given configuration must be given.\n17\nThe model calculates a set of average Nilsson numbers, \u3008N\u3009, \u3008nz\u3009, \u3008\u039b\u3009 and \u3008| \u2126 |\u3009 for the\nconfigurations to be constrained in the deformation space. For most of the orbits involved\nin the multi-quasiparticle configurations in the mass A\u223c130 region, these average numbers\nare well defined and quite stable over the deformation area considered. The nuclear shape\nis finally obtained by minimising the calculated potential energy in the quadrupole (\u03b22, \u03b3)\nplane, with hexadecapole (\u03b24) variation.\nFigure 8 and Table II show the calculated PESs and excitation energies for different two-\nquasiparticle configurations. The results for the ground- and Jpi=8\u2212 states are consistent\nwith those published in Xu et al. [21]. The upper panel of figure 8 shows the PES calculation\nperformed for the ground-state (zero rotation, h\u00af\u03c9=0). A triaxial shape is predicted with\n| \u03b3 |=32.4\u25e6, \u03b22=0.134 and \u03b24=0.000. This figure also shows that the ground-state is predicted\nto be soft against the \u03b3-degree of freedom.\nA 9\/2\u2212[514]\u22971\/2+[400] two-quasiparticle configuration is proposed for the Kpi=5\u2212 state,\nwith a predicted excitation energy of 2.17 MeV. This value is in good agreement with the\nexperimentally determined energy (Eexp = 2.23 MeV) and with previous work [22], where an\nequivalent \u03bd(1h\u22121\n11\/2 3s\n\u22121\n1\/2) two-hole configuration with a calculated energy of \u223c2.4 MeV was\nproposed for this state. The middle panel of figure 8 shows the results of the PES calculation\nfor the Kpi=5\u2212 configuration, which is predicted (at h\u00af\u03c9=0) to have a triaxial shape with\n| \u03b3 |=35.4\u25e6, \u03b22=0.142 and \u03b24=\u22120.004. Similar negative parity bands have been observed in\nthe N = 72 isotone 126Xe [23], where large signature splitting between the members of the\ntwo signature bands was associated with triaxial deformation. However, the corresponding\nbands in 128Ba [24] show no signature splitting, and this might be due to a decreasing triaxial\ndeformation as \u03b22 increases. This is consistent with previous work on the odd-even Ba, Ce,\nNd and Sm isotopes (A\u223c130), which associates triaxiality with large signature splittings,\nthe latter being larger as Z and \u03b22 decrease [25] and the closed shell Z = 50 is approached.\nIn principle, it is possible that the Kpi=5\u2212 band could contain octupole admixtures which\nwould cause a lower spin for the (unobserved) band-head, and a corresponding decrease in\nthe K-value associated with the band. Such behaviour has been observed in the Os and\nHf isotopes [26, 27] where it has been proposed that the low-lying octupole vibration is\ncrossed at moderate frequency by a shape driving, two-quasiproton excitation. In fact, a\nJpi=3\u2212 state has been proposed in 128Xe [3] at an excitation energy of 2138.6 keV but it is\nnot observed in the current work. This is not surprising since a heavy-ion reaction which\n18\npopulates only near-yrast states has been used. However, if the observed band was based\non an octupole configuration, it would be expected that the energy difference between the\nJpi=7\u2212 and 5\u2212 states would mimic that between the yrast 4+ and 2+ states [28, 29], and be\nabout 590 keV. Since the observed value is 353 keV, this provides further evidence for the\nJpi=5\u2212 level being an intrinsic state.\nThe bottom panel of figure 8 shows that the Kpi=8\u2212 7\/2+[404]\u22979\/2\u2212[514] configuration\nis expected to have a nearly axially symmetric shape with | \u03b3 |=6\u25e6, \u03b22=0.160 and \u03b24=-\n0.008 (h\u00af\u03c9=0). In addition, the excitation energy of the Kpi=8\u2212 state is predicted at 2.49\nMeV, in reasonable agreement with the experimentally determined value of 2.78 MeV. The\nsymmetric deformation predicted for the Kpi=8\u2212 configuration implies that K might still be\na good quantum number in this case.\nB. Four-quasiparticle configurations.\nTable III lists the low-lying four-quasiparticle configurations for this nucleus, calculated\nusing the same method as for the two-quasiparticle configurations but considering only 4\nquasi-neutron, or 2 quasi-neutron and 2 quasi-proton, configurations. The levels are listed\nin order of increasing energy and the lowest predicted state (Jpi=12+ at 4.48 MeV) contains\nall 3 of the quasi neutrons which were discussed in the previous section in terms of forming\nthe Jpi=5\u2212 and 8\u2212 states. This 7\/2\u2212[523]\u22977\/2+[404]\u22979\/2\u2212[514]\u22971\/2+[400] configuration\nis calculated to have | \u03b3 |=30\u25e6. Since this is triaxial, the blocked states are not pure\nNilsson orbitals and the minimum in the plot does not represent a pure Kpi=12+ state. The\ntheoretical assignment of Kpi=12+ is therefore nominal, but the four-quasiparticle nature is\nwell defined, and the energy is an upper bound, since projection of pure K states will include\nat least one state below the 4.48 MeV triaxial configuration. The potential energy surface\nfor this configuration is shown in figure 9. Table III shows that the lowest Jpi=13\u2212 state is\ncalculated at 5.84 MeV with the lowest Jpi=13+ state at 4.95 MeV, both considerably above\nthe experimental energy of 4.09 MeV.\n19\n0.05 0.08 0.10 0.13\nX = \u03b22cos(\u03b3+30)\n0.05\n0.08\n0.10\n0.13\nY \n= \n\u03b2 2s\nin\n(\u03b3+\n30\n)\nFIG. 9: The potential energy surface for the Jpi=12+ state at 4.48 MeV.

Hence,\nthe excitation energy of the isomeric state increases as the deformation decreases, as shown\nin figure 10. This figure also shows that it is only in 128Xe that the excitation energy of\nthe Jpi=7\u2212 member of the Kpi=5\u2212 band is lower than that of the Kpi=8\u2212 state. Therefore,\nin 128Xe the Kpi=8\u2212 isomeric state preferentially decays to the Jpi=7\u2212 state, rather than by\n21\na seven times K-forbidden E1 transition to the 8+ member of the yrast band (assumed to\nhave K=0). The hindrance factors, FW for the decay of the K\npi=8\u2212 isomeric state are given\nin table IV. FW is defined as:\nFW =\nt\u03b3\n1\/2(\nM\nE \u03bb)\ntW\n1\/2(\nM\nE \u03bb)\n(2)\nwhere t\u03b3\n1\/2(\nM\nE \u03bb) and t\nW\n1\/2(\nM\nE \u03bb) are the measured partial \u03b3-ray half-life and the Weisskopf\nsingle-particle estimate, respectively. For K-forbidden transitions it is sometimes useful to\ncompare Weisskopf hindrance factors, FW , for different \u2206K values [30]. The degree of\nK-forbiddenness, \u03bd, is defined by,\n\u03bd = \u2206K \u2212 \u03bb (3)\nand the hindrance per degree of K-forbiddenness is defined by,\nf\u03bd = (FW )\n1\/\u03bd . (4)\nIn calculating the values of f\u03bd quoted in this table, it is assumed that the 6\n\u2212 and 7\u2212 states\n(at 2500 and 2582 keV respectively) are members of the Kpi=5\u2212 band.\nFigure 11 shows the f\u03bd value measured for the transition from the K\npi=8\u2212 state to the\n8+ member of the yrast band in comparison with those for other N=74 isotones. The plot\nincludes the recently measured value for 132Ce [31]. The data point for 128Xe indicates a\nbig decrease in the f\u03bd value between\n130Ba and 128Xe. Indeed the 128Xe value is surprisingly\nsimilar to those of the heavier (Z \u2265 60) nuclei which have well-deformed prolate shapes and\nthe K-selection rule would be expected to be correspondingly more rigorous.\nThere are two possible explanations for this. The first is in terms of the change in\nshape between 128Xe and 130Ba. Although the beta deformation of all four relevant states is\ncalculated to be about 0.16, the gamma deformations are markedly different with | \u03b3 |=6\u25e6\nand | \u03b3 |=32\u25e6 respectively for the isomeric- and ground- states in 128Xe (see table II), and\n| \u03b3 |=6\u25e6 and | \u03b3 |=16\u25e6 for 130Ba [21]. Thus while the isomeric states are both calculated\nto have | \u03b3 |=6\u25e6, the ground states change from | \u03b3 |=32\u25e6 for 128Xe to | \u03b3 |=16\u25e6 for 130Ba.\nThis is illustrated in figure 1 of reference [21]. The larger value of | \u03b3 | for the ground state\nof 128Xe as compared to 130Ba implies more K-mixing and hence a lower value of f\u03bd .\n22\n54 56 58 60 62 64 66\nProton number (Z)\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nf \u03bd\nFIG. 11: f\u03bd values for the transition from the K\npi=8\u2212 state to the 8+ member of the yrast band in\nthe N=74 isotones.\nThe second explanation follows the discussion in [9] where the differences in f\u03bd are inter-\npreted in terms of the amount of mixing in the yrast 8+ state to which the Kpi=8\u2212 state\ndecays. This interpretation is linked to the alignment in the yrast band and figure 12 shows\nthis property for the relevant N=74 nuclei. The figure shows that the backbend for 128Xe\nstarts to occur around Jpi=8+ which implies that there is considerable K mixing in the\nJpi=8+ state. Hence the decay from the Jpi=Kpi=8\u2212 state will not be as hindered as might\notherwise be expected. The 130Ba and 132Ce backbends begin 2h\u00af higher but it is of note\nthat the alignment for 128Xe is very similar to that for 134Nd and indeed the f\u03bd value is also\nvery similar. Note also however that the existence of an isomeric state in 128Xe does imply\nthat K is in some sense conserved in its decay. The transition to the yrast band in this case\nis hindered by a factor of 2.5 x 109, compared to typical allowed hindrances of about 104.\nD. Rotational behaviour.\nThe band built on the Jpi=10+ state at 3364 keV is most likely the extension of the\nground-state band with the previously observed yrast states corresponding to the (pih11\/2)\n2\nquasiproton configuration suggested by Wyss et al. [1]. Analogous positive-parity s-bands\nhave been discussed in the neighbouring Xe, Ba and Ce nuclei but lack of experimental\ndata on the extension of the ground-state band prevented Wyss et al. from making similar\nconclusions in 128Xe.\nA plot of excitation energy against J(J+1) for the ground-state, Kpi=5\u2212 and 8\u2212 and four-\n23\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7\nRotational frequency (MeV)\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nAl\nig\nnm\nen\nt\n128 Xe\n130 Ba\n132 Ce\n134 Nd\n136 Sm\n138 Gd\nFIG. 12: Experimental alignments for 128Xe, 130Ba, 132Ce, 134Nd, 136Sm and 138Gd.

The figure shows that the yrast band begins to\nfollow a rotational pattern at 10 h\u00af. In the case of the band built on the Kpi=5\u2212 intrinsic\nstate, figure 13 shows a very marked odd-even staggering with the odd-spin levels being\npushed lower in energy at the bottom of the band and the reverse being true above the\n11\u2212 state. This is perhaps not surprising however given the fact that the PES calculations\npredict a gamma deformation for this structure of | \u03b3 |=35.4\u25e6 and figure 8 indicates that\nthe nucleus is very gamma soft.\nThe behaviour of the Kpi=8\u2212 band is similarly complex with figure 13 showing odd-even\nstaggering with the even-spin levels pushed up in energy. Consistent with this, the branching\nratios of the \u2206J=1 and \u2206J=2 transitions in this band are not observed to follow a simple\nrotational model.\nV. CONCLUSIONS.\nAn extended decay scheme for 128Xe has been established in the current work with the\nyrast band being extended to 22h\u00af. Signature partner bands built on the Kpi=5\u2212 and Kpi=8\u2212\nintrinsic states have been shown to exhibit strong odd-even staggering in their level energies.\nA 9\/2\u2212[514]\u22971\/2+[400] two-quasiparticle configuration is proposed for the Kpi=5\u2212 configu-\nration. A half-life of 73(3) ns has been measured for the Kpi=8\u2212 intrinsic state which has a\n24\nFIG. 13: (Color online) Excitation energy minus an arbitrary reference-rotor plotted against J(J+1)\nfor the yrast band (circles), the ground-state band extension (squares), bands built on the Kpi=5\u2212\n(triangles up) and Kpi=8\u2212 (triangles down) intrinsic states and the proposed four-quasiparticle\nband (diamonds).\n9\/2\u2212[514]\u22977\/2+[404] two-neutron configuration. A possible 4 quasiparticle state has been\nobserved at 4087 keV.\nThe configuration-constrained blocking method has been used to calculate potential en-\nergy surfaces and excitation energies for the ground- and intrinsic states. The results predict\ntriaxial shapes for the ground-state and Kpi=5\u2212 intrinsic state and a nearly axially symmet-\nric shape for the Kpi=8\u2212 isomeric state. The decay from this latter state to the yrast band\nhas a reduced hindrance per degree of forbiddenness of 22(2) which is much lower than for\nthe neighbouring N=74 nucleus 130Ba. This reduction is considered to be at least partly due\nto K-mixing in the 8+ yrast state to which the isomer decays.\nAcknowledgements\nThe visitors to the ANU would like to thank the technical and academic staff of the\n14UD accelerator at the Australian National University for their assistance and hospitality.\nJ.C.
