TEM images of the adsorbed \nantibody on the CNTs show that the covalent modification approach was successful, \nwhereas the non-covalent approach resulted in no electrochemically detectable labelled \nantibody.  Direct electrical communication between CNTs covalently linked to \nperoxidase-labelled antibodies was observed during cyclic voltammetry, which indicates \napplications in developing carbon-nanotube-based immunosensors. \n \nKeywords: carbon nanotube, antibody, functionalisation, electrochemical immunosensor.  \n 2\n1. Introduction \nMany new biomarkers associated with different stages of disease have been elucidated by \ngenomics and proteomics research and their efficient detection may lead to early \ndiagnosis. Extensive use of these disease markers in healthcare depends on developing \ntechniques that allow the rapid detection of these markers with high selectivity and \nsensitivity. Advances in molecular detection currently focus on several areas including \ndeveloping new methods for quantitation of a specific binding event through \nelectrochemical or electronic measurements. Nanomaterials such as quantum dots, \nnanoparticles, nanotubes, and nanowires may have potential for developing assays with \nimproved sensitivity in recognising a specific binding event. This may involve the use of \nnano-sized electrodes based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). \n \nThe development of miniaturised transducers capable of selectively determining the \npresence and\/or concentration of analytes is greatly facilitated by immobilisation of \nenzymes and antibodies onto CNTs. Due to their unique mechanical and electrical \nproperties CNTs are one of the most widely studied nanomaterials [1]. Compared to \nother carbon electrodes, CNT-modified electrodes have shown superior performances in \nelectrochemical studies of biologically relevant molecules such as hydrogen peroxide [2], \nreduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) [3] and dopamine [4]. CNTs are an \nattractive material in bio-electrochemistry with the dual benefits of their electrical \nconductivity and the nanotopography they provide in electrode structures. The latter \nproperty maximises the possibility of bringing CNTs into close proximity with proteins \n 3\nand enables CNTs to act as one dimensional nanochannels for the electron transfer in \nproteins [5, 7, 8].  \n \nMolecules with specific recognition sites must be tethered onto the nanotube surface to \nfacilitate a predictable alteration in nanotube electronics, triggered by the binding of \ntarget analyte molecules. CNTs are receptive to functionalisation either by oxidative \nprocesses that form reactive groups, or through direct covalent or non-covalent \nmodification of the sidewalls. Covalent attachment involves direct attachment of the \nfunctionality to the CNTs via the formation of chemical bonds, altering carbon-carbon \nbonds from sp2 to sp3 structure leading to a loss of conjugation and a subsequent change \nin electronic properties. Non-covalent attachment involves CNT-molecule interactions \ninvolving electrostatic, van der Waals and\/or hydrophobic interactions and preserves the \nsp2 structures and therefore, electronic properties. However, the non-covalent molecular \nlinkage is less robust than covalent linkages. Furthermore, the nature of non-covalent \nattachment may result in denaturation of the protein.  \n \nThe natural affinity of protein hydrophobic domains toward carbon nanotubes allows for \nnon-covalent functionalisation of such biomolecules. Good electrochemical \ncommunication between multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and redox proteins \nhave been observed both at the protein surface in the case of horse radish peroxidase \n(HRP) [5, 6], cytochrome C [7] and azurin [8], and deep within the protein \nmacrostructure e.g. glucose oxidase [9]. Azamian et al. [10] observed adsorption of \nferritin protein onto SWNTs which resulted in the solubilisation of SWNTs in water. In \n 4\ncontrast, Dai and co-workers reported that incubating SWNTs grown on a TEM grid in \naqueous ferritin solution resulted in no observable adsorption [11]. More recently we \nreported how ferritin protein was non-covalently immobilised onto SWNTs bundles [12]. \nIndividual SWNTs did not appear to support the ferritin molecules, which is not \nsurprising given the size of the ferritin molecules (diameter ~13 nm) compared to the \nSWNTs (diameter ~1 nm). Ferritin dispersed the SWNTs well in solution, resulting in a \nsmaller SWNT bundle size, but the protein must be in large excess to achieve this. Such \nadsorption\/immobilisation of proteins may result in deformation of the protein tertiary \nstructure to achieve pi-stacking along the nanotube walls. In contrast, use of the \nbifunctional linker, pyrenebutanoic acid succinimide ester, was reported by Dai and co-\nworkers to immobilise proteins on SWNT surfaces [11]. The pyrene moiety is reported to \n\u03c0-\u03c0 stack with the CNT sidewall allowing the succinimidyl ester group to react with \namines in the proteins, allowing the non-covalent immobilisation of proteins with \nretained biological activity and functionality. \n \nIn addition to enzymes, biomolecules such as biotin, streptavidin [13] and antibodies \nhave been used to functionalise CNTs. Wohlstadter et al. [14] used strong acid to etch a \ndensely packed nanotube sheet resulting in the availability of surface carboxylic acid \ngroups. Streptavidin was immobilised on the nanotube sheet by carbodiimide-activated \ncoupling. The specific biotin\u2013streptavidin interaction enabled the attachment of a \nbiotinylated mAb for \uf061-fetoprotein (AFP). Prato and co-workers prepared amino acid- \n[15] and peptide-functionalised SWNTs [16]. Their two-step procedure consisted \ninitially of functionalising CNTs with aminoethylene glycol. In the second step, protected \n 5\namino acids reacted directly with the amino groups on the CNTs [15]. Oligo- and \npolypeptides were covalently linked to these amino-CNTs via amidation with fully \nprotected peptides or a succinimide\u2013maleimido bridge [16]. In vitro immunological \nstudies showed that an antigenic epitope from the foot-and-mouth disease virus retained \nthe necessary active structure for interaction with specific antibodies upon attachment to \nSWNTs [16]. In the course of this work we have attached antibodies to CNTs using a \ncovalent and non-covalent approach and evaluated the performance of each material as an \nelectrochemical transducer. \n 6\n2. Experimental \nSWNTs (purified, Carbon Nanotechnologies, Inc, Houston), COOH functionalised \nMWNT (MWNT-COOH, Nanocyl, Belgium), hyaluronic acid (HA, Sigma), sodium \ndodecyl sulfate (SDS, Sigma), phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Oxoid, Hampshire, \nEngland), mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Sigma), bovine serum albumin (BSA, \nSigma), anti-mouse IgG labelled with horse radish peroxidase (derived from goat, \nSigma), anti-mouse IgG labelled with biotin (derived from goat, Sigma), QDOTTM605 \nstreptavidin conjugate (Quantum Dot Corp, California), 3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-tetramethylbenzidine \ndihydrochloride (TMB, Sigma) were used as received. \nCharacterisation of the samples by enzyme assay was obtained using a Tecan \nSafire2 microplate reader. Absorbance readings were taken at a wavelength of 450 nm. \nFluorescence analysis of the samples was obtained using an excitation wavelength of 450 \nnm and an emission wavelength of 605 nm. UV-visible-NIR spectra of the samples were \nexamined over the range of 300-1400 nm (Varian Cary 500 Scan UV-visible-NIR \nspectrophotometer). Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed using a Jobin \nYvon Horiba HR800 Spectrometer equipped with a He:Ne laser (\u03bb = 632.8 nm) utilising \na 950-line grating. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed \nusing a Jeol 1400 microscope (100 kV). Cyclic voltammetry was performed using an \neDAQ e-corder (401) and potentiostat\/galvanostat (EA 160) with Chart v5.1.2\/EChem v \n2.0.2 software (ADInstruments), and a PC computer in phosphate buffered saline solution \n(PBS - 0.2 M, pH=7.4) with Ag\/AgCl reference electrode and platinum mesh counter \nelectrode. \n \n 7\n2.1 CNT preparation \nCNT dispersions were prepared in the following manner: HA-SWNT dispersions were \nprepared from an aqueous solution of HA (0.4 wt %) containing SWNT in a ratio of 3:2, \nwhich was ultra-sonicated using pulse (2s on, 1s off) for 30 minutes using a high power \nsonic tip (500 W, 30% amplitude). This dispersion (300 \uf06dl) was dispersed in 9.66 ml \nwater resulting in a final concentration of 180 mg l-1 of CNTs. \nTwo milligrammes of MWNT-COOH were prepared in 10ml of distilled water \ncontaining 1% (v\/v) SDS to aid dispersion. These tubes were sonicated at 60 W for 3 min \nwithout pulse using a sonic tip and then sonicated for 1 hour (in a sonic bath). The \nnanotubes were in solution and were used without further alteration. \n \n2.2 Antibody Immobilisation onto CNTs \n2.2.1 Non-Covalent Immobilisation \nBriefly, 100\u03bcl of mouse IgG, at a concentration of 0.1 mg ml-1 was added to the CNT \ndispersions overnight with stirring at 4\u00b0C. The CNTs-IgG mixture was centrifuged and \nwashed with distilled water 3 times. Any remaining unreacted sites on the CNTs were \nblocked with 5 mg ml-1 BSA and reacted for a further 3 hours at 4\u00b0C. The CNTs were \nthen centrifuged (5 min at 4000 rpm) and washed 3 times with distilled water. Anti-\nmouse IgG labelled with HRP was diluted 1 in 1000 in 1% (w\/v) BSA\/PBS and 5 mls of \nthis solution was added to the CNT pellet, re-dispersed and incubated at 37\u00b0C for one \nhour. The CNTs were then centrifuged (5 min at 4000 rpm) and washed a further 3 times \nwith PBS. This procedure was repeated as above using anti-mouse IgG labelled with \nbiotin and streptavidin-labelled quantum dots (QDOTTM605) in place of HRP. \n 8\n 2.2.1 Covalent Immobilisation \nAntibodies were covalently immobilised in a similar manner to the procedure described \nfor non-covalent immobilisation except for the addition of 4 mg ethyl \ndiaminocarbodiimide (EDC), the zero length crosslinker, to the dispersion. \n \n2.3 Antibody Detection \nHRP-labelled antibodies were detected using the 3,3\uf0a2,5,5\uf0a2-tetramethylbenzidine \ndihydrochloride (TMB) assay prepared as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 10 \u00b5l of \nthe antibody-labelled CNT solution was added to a 90 \u00b5l of PBS in a microtitre well. The \nTMB solution (100 \u00b5l) was then added to the well and incubated in the dark at room \ntemperature for 20 min.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 \u00b5l of 10% (v\/v) \nHCl and the absorbance was read at 450 nm in a Tecan Safire2 microplate reader.   \nAntibodies labelled with biotin were detected using streptavidin-labelled quantum dots. \nAntibody-labelled CNT solutions (10 \u00b5l) were added to PBS in a microtitre well (90 \u00b5l). \nThe QDOTTM 605 streptavidin conjugate (100 \u00b5l of a 20 nM solution) was added to the \nwell and incubated at room temperature for 30 mins.  The fluorescence was determined \nusing excitation at 450 nm and emission at 605 nm in the microplate reader. \n25 \uf06dl of each CNT\/Ab-HRP suspension was cast as a film onto clean glassy carbon \nelectrodes and used as the working electrode in cyclic voltammetry. As a control, 10 mg \nMWNTs was dispersed in 10 ml water and 25 \uf06dl of this suspension was cast as a film \nonto two clean glassy carbon electrodes. A further control was prepared by adding 25 \uf06dl \n 9\nof a 1 mg ml-1 HRP in PBS (0.2 M, pH=7.4) onto one of the aforementioned control \nMWNT electrodes. \n 10\n3. Results and Discussion \nThe immobilisation of antibodies onto CNTs using non-covalent or covalent attachment \nwas investigated and the performance of each material as an electrochemical transducer \nwas evaluated. Covalent immobilisation involved a very simple procedure of attachment \nto polysaccharides non-covalently adsorbed onto CNTs and, in a separate experiment, to \ncarboxyl functionalised CNTs. Of particular interest were comparative electrochemical \ntransduction capabilities between covalently and non-covalently modified CNTs. \n \nThe use of either MWNTs or SWNTs was investigated in these studies. MWNT-COOH \nwere dispersed with the aid of surfactant (SDS) and SWNTs were dispersed using a \nglycosaminoglycan (hyaluronic acid, HA), which was recently found to be an excellent \ndispersant for SWNTs [17]. For the non-covalent immobilisation approach, these \ndispersions were mixed with the primary antibody, mouse IgG, and named MWNT NC \nand SWNT NC. For the covalent immobilisation approach, the dispersions were mixed \nwith mouse IgG and the cross linker EDC and named MWNT Cov and SWNT Cov. Non-\nspecific binding for both functionalisation approaches was eliminated by adsorbing BSA. \nAn unlabelled antibody was immobilised onto the CNTs as future work will involve \nadaptation of this method for a sandwich immunoassay. \n \nIn order to detect the presence of the immobilised antibody, a secondary antibody, anti-\nmouse IgG labelled with HRP, was used. The secondary antibody was incubated with the \nprimary antibody-modified CNTs (as illustrated in Figure 1). The CNT products (MWNT \nCov-HRP, SWNT Cov-HRP, MWNT NC-HRP, SWNT NC-HRP, where Cov and NC \n 11\nindicate covalent and non-covalent coupling strategies, respectively) were assayed using \nthe colorimetric tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) enzyme assay. The TMB assay results \n(Figure 2) indicate that the presence of antibody on the covalently modified CNTs is \nconsiderably higher than on the non-covalently modified samples (nearly three times \nhigher for SWNTs and twice as high for MWNTs). This was found to be true in the case \nof both single and multi-walled CNTs. This result suggests that the covalent \nimmobilisation of antibodies on CNTs is more successful than simple adsorption in the \ncase of non-covalent modification of CNTs. \n \nIn an alternative coupling experiment, the secondary antibody, anti-mouse IgG labelled \nwith biotin, was incubated with the primary antibody modified CNTs, followed by \nincubation with streptavidin-labelled quantum dots (QDOTs) (MWNT Cov-QDOT, \nSWNT Cov-QDOT, MWNT NC-QDOT, SWNT NC-QDOT). These CNT samples were \nanalysed by fluorescence spectroscopy and Figure 3 illustrates that the covalently \nmodified samples exhibited greater fluorescence than the non-covalently modified \nsamples. These results again suggest that a higher concentration of antibodies are \nimmobilised on CNTs using a covalent modification approach. Quantum dots have \npreviously been used as fluorescence labels for biomolecules [18]. This approach should \nbe widely applicable to biomolecules immobilised on CNTs since it was determined that \nthere was no interference in the fluorescence emissions (Figure 3).   \n \nIt has been shown that the UV-visible and near infra-red spectroscopic properties of \nSWNT dispersions vary greatly with their environment due to selective interaction of \n 12\nmolecules with CNTs of different diameter and band gap [19]. The well known \nabsorption peaks of the SWNTs van Hove singularities occurring between 500-1000 nm \nwere observed (Figure 4). Clear differences are observed between the spectra of SWNTs \nwith antibodies covalently immobilised compared with the equivalent non-covalent \ndispersions. The shift in the absorption peaks of the SWNTs in the covalently \nfunctionalised samples may be due to selective interaction of the SWNTs with the \nantibodies, as was previously observed with biomolecules and SWNTs [19]. This trend in \nsimilarities between UV-visible-NIR spectra is not seen for covalently functionalised \nMWNT samples compared with non-covalent MWNT dispersions (results not shown).  \n \nRaman spectroscopy is a powerful technique for the characterisation of CNTs [20] and \nwas used to determine if a difference existed in CNTs obtained using the different \napproaches to functionalisation. The D and G lines of both forms of CNT and the radial \nbreathing mode (RBM) peaks of the SWNTs were examined (results not shown). No \nsignificant changes were observed between covalently and non-covalently functionalised \nCNTs. In the case of the covalently functionalised samples this is expected since no new \nfunctional groups on the CNT sidewalls were created. Existing functional groups were \nmodified on the dispersant in the case of SWNTs and existing carboxyl groups on the \nMWNTs were functionalised. \n \nThe RBM peaks, which are often observed between 100 and 250 cm-1, are directly linked \nto the reciprocal of the nanotube diameter. Bundled SWNTs are subject to inter-tube \ninteractions which increase the frequency of the radial breathing modes. RBM peak shifts \n 13\nare also observed when molecules interact with CNT sidewalls e.g. upon wrapping of \nCNTs with polymers\/surfactants. Comparison of the Raman spectra of SWNT samples \nshows few differences and RBM shifts are not significant. In the case of covalently \nfunctionalised SWNT samples this is predicted, since we are modifying functional groups \non the dispersant and not creating new ones on the CNT sidewalls. Again no significant \nRBM mode changes are observed for the non-covalently functionalised SWNTs, \nsuggesting that there is little interaction between the antibody and the nanotube, and \ntherefore that non-covalent functionalisation was not successful. \n \nTEM imaging of the MWNT samples provided clear evidence of whether or not proteins \nwere adsorbed or functionalised on the CNT surface. Imaging of the HRP enzyme \nattached to the anti-mouse antibody is straightforward due to the metal centre of the \nperoxidase, as is TEM imaging of the metal semiconductor QDOT nanoparticles. Figure \n5 shows TEM images of MWNT samples from functionalisation strategies using both the \nHRP and QDOT labels. The size of HRP protein is ~ 5 nm in diameter [21], which was \nconfirmed by dynamic light scattering experiments (4.6 nm mean size). TEM images of \nMWNT samples (Figure 5) with antibodies covalently attached clearly show the walls of \nthe CNTs. It is apparent that they are covered with both conjugated antibodies and \nadsorbed polymer which may be the oligosaccharide used to disperse the CNTs and \nanchor the antibodies. In stark contrast, the MWNT samples which underwent non-\ncovalent immobilisation show no features which could be ascribed to either the antibody, \nBSA blocking protein, oligosaccharide dispersant or the HRP label. This may be due to \nthe vigorous washing steps involved in the immobilisation protocol. \n 14\n The QDOT label is a nanometre-scale crystal of CdSe coated ZnS, which is further \ncoated with a polymer shell that was coupled to streptavidin. This gives the QDOT label \na size similar to that of a large macromolecule or protein (~15\u201320 nm). These are clearly \nevident from the TEM images in Figure 5b from the MWNT samples which were \nsubmitted to the covalent functionalisation procedure. On the contrary, the non-\ncovalently modified samples show no features of the size of the QDOT label (~15\u201320 \nnm); indicating in both instances that the covalent approach was more successful.  \n \nElectrochemical characterisation of the CNTs functionalised with anti-mouse IgG \nlabelled with HRP was carried out in phosphate buffered saline as electrolyte (pH=7.4). \nFigure 6 shows the cyclic voltammograms obtained from MWNT samples drop cast as \nfilms on glassy carbon electrodes. No clear redox responses were observed from HRP at \nthe MWNT NC-HRP sample. A pair of broad reduction\/reoxidation responses was \nobserved at ~ -0.33 V and -0.70 V vs. Ag\/AgCl, respectively, which have previously \nbeen observed at oxidised MWNTs and attributed to reduction of the carboxylic acid \ngroups and their subsequent reoxidation [22]. An electrode was constructed using 25 \uf06dl \nof MWNTs sonicated in water and drop cast on a glassy carbon electrode as a control.  \nCyclic voltammetry of this control sample in PBS (not shown) exhibited the broad redox \npeaks attributed to the carboxylic acids groups of the functionalised MWNTs. \n \nThese oxidation and reduction peaks of the MWNT-COOH groups were also observed in \nthe MWNT Cov-HRP sample. In addition, an evident stable redox couple (Figure 6, \n 15\nanodic peak A (+0.16 V) and cathodic peak A\u2019 (+0.09 V)) was observed which may be \nattributed to the iron centre of the HRP enzyme. To verify this, a further control sample, \nconstructed in the same manner as before but also containing 10 \uf06dl of a 1mg ml-1 solution \nof HRP in PBS, was examined by cyclic voltammetry. A stable redox couple was \nobserved from the cyclic voltammogram of this control sample (Figure 6, anodic peak A \n(+0.17 V) and cathodic peak A\u2019 (+0.11 V) (Figure 6a)). This confirms that the redox \ncouple shown at the MWNT Cov-HRP sample was due to the HRP moiety. These results \nshow that direct electrical communication was achieved between the highly conductive \nCNTs and peroxidase enzymes covalently bioconjugated to their sidewalls and ends. \n \nCyclic voltammetry of SWNTs covalently functionalised with anti-mouse IgG labelled \nwith HRP, carried out in phosphate buffered saline, show an oxidation peak (A) at 0.13 V \nand a corresponding reduction peak (A\u2019) at 0.08 V vs. Ag\/AgCl, which have again been \nascribed to the Fe (II)\/Fe (III) couple of the HRP enzyme (Figure 7). This redox couple is \nnot observed from the SWNT NC-HRP sample, confirming the TEM, UV-visible-NIR \nand Raman spectroscopy results, that the non-covalent immobilisation protocol was less \nsuccessful.  \n \nThe cyclic voltammetric responses of CNTs functionalised with the HRP-labelled \nantibody in phosphate buffered saline (pH=7.4) to the addition of 37.5 \uf06dmol dm-3 H2O2 \nare shown in Figure 6b and Figure 7b. Upon addition of H2O2, the current increased \nsharply by 289 \uf06dA (at 0.39 V vs. Ag\/AgCl) and 114 \uf06dA (at 0.49 V vs. Ag\/AgCl) for the \ncovalently modified SWNT and MWNT samples, respectively. The response obtained \n 16\nconfirms the electrochemical activity of HRP which was immobilised on the secondary \nantibody. In comparison, the current responses to H2O2 obtained from non-covalently \nmodified SWNT and MWNT samples, under identical conditions were 17 \uf06dA (Figure 7b) \nand 60 \uf06dA (Figure 6b), respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of \ndesigning immunosensors for proteins by covalently binding antibodies to an \noligosaccharide used to disperse SWNTs, resulting in a 17-fold improvement in \nsensitivity compared to non-covalently modified CNT samples. \n \n4. Conclusion \nSingle wall and multi-walled carbon nanotubes were functionalised with horse radish \nperoxidase and quantum dot-labelled antibodies by two approaches, covalent and non-\ncovalent functionalisation. These samples were characterised using a variety of \ntechniques including colorimetric enzyme and fluorescence assays, UV-visible-NIR and \nRaman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The \nresults suggest that the covalent modification approach was successful, whereas the non-\ncovalent modification approach resulted in no electrochemically detectable labelled \nantibodies on the CNTs. Immobilisation was achieved without denaturing antibodies, as \nis sometimes the case for non-covalently immobilised enzymes. Finally, direct electrical \ncommunication between the CNTs and peroxidase-labelled antibodies was achieved \nindicating that CNTs are suitable nano-electrochemical transducers in immunoassays. \nThus antibody-functionalised CNTs may have the potential to have the required \nsensitivity and desired portability for point of care devices. \n \n 17\n5.
