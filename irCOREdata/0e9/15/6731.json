I was astonished by the large number of responses in my mailbox,\nnot one of them dissenting from the views I expressed, and many offering examples of how\nexcellent peer-reviewed publications in good journals, sometimes associated with very\nrespectable research grants, had vanished into the ether when it came to the last Research\nAssessment Exercise (RAE). Outside education as a discipline (and even there . . . ) , RAE\nsubject panels appear to consider that research into learning technology is not really worth\ncounting. University teachers of languages, history, biology, engineering and so on may\nproduce seminal papers on learning technology within their subject-areas, and for the\npurposes of their department's RAE rating they might as well not have bothered - indeed,\nthey may even be reprimanded for not having aimed more directly between the RAE goal-\nposts. Even within disciplines such as computer science or psychology, where one might\nimagine that much research into educational technology would comfortably fit, I know of\ncolleagues who have been on the receiving end of such discouragement.\nI have three inter-related objections to the attitude displayed by RAE subject panels and,\nby inevitable extension, senior university management and departmental research\ncommittees. The first is that the attitude negates the inter-disciplinary research we are now\nand then urged to undertake in Government policy documents, let alone any research\ncarried out individually in an area outside the narrow confines of an academic's own\ndiscipline (this does happen, and some good research is produced). The second objection is\nconcerned with what a university should be, namely a place where there are no no-go areas\nof intellectual inquiry. How is one to comprehend obstacles to research into learning - a\nsubject which by definition should be central to any learning institution - either passively\nby sheer indifference to endeavour or actively by pressure? The third objection lies in my\nsuspicion that, despite fine words about the information-technology revolution\npronounced (often unthinkingly, and even more often without any real understanding of\n2\nALT-J Volume 5 Number 3\nit) by some of the senior academics who sit on RAE subject panels, the result of their\ndeliberations frequently hides a deep-seated distrust of the use of technology in teaching.\nThe Dearing Report, disappointingly, hardly addressed this question head-on, but\nindirectly it had a great deal to say about it. The emphasis on the use of communication\nand information technologies, and the proposal to establish an Institute of Learning with\nits remit to foster research into learning technology, imply that our subject-area is one\nwhich deserves full recognition as a research field in its own right.\nI imagine that few readers of this journal will strongly dissent from the opinions I have\nexpressed on this matter, and if that is so, a decision has to be made. Should we concentrate\nour efforts on campaigning for a separate subject panel for learning technology, or on\ncampaigning for the existing subject panels to take learning technology into account? An\neffort to see the creation of a specific learning-technology subject panel may raise all\nmanner of thorny questions, such as how one would incorporate an RAE rating in this\nfield within the overall rating of a department whose principal activities are not concerned\nwith it. I therefore believe that we should lobby for research into learning technology to be\nrecognized by subject panels as a valid area of activity within any university discipline, thus\ndeserving full recognition with respect to RAE ratings.\nThe massification of higher education, modularization, and the advent of lifelong learning\nas a major objective will probably, in time, oblige future assessors of research activity to\nlook beyond the boundaries of mainstream subject-specific work, but if we are to change\nattitudes before the next RAE in the year 2000 (we can assume that it, or something like it,\nwill take place), a plan of action is urgently required. Suggestions welcome.\nGabriel Jacobs\n3\n"}
