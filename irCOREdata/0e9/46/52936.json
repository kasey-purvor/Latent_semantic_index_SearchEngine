INTRODUCTION \nSigma delta modulation is a kind of source coding techniques [Janssen, 2003]. An \ninput signal is first sampled at a much higher rate than the Nyquist rate. The most \ncommon oversampling ratios are 64, 128 and 256, depending on the applications. Then \nthe sampled signal is subtracted from the output of the interpolative sigma delta \nmodulator (SDM) and filtered via a loop filter. Finally, the loop filter output is \nquantized to produce the output of the SDM via a very coarse quantizer, such as a single \nbit quantizer. The block diagram of an interpolative SDM is shown in Figure 1 [Janssen, \n2003]. Because of the simple, robust and inexpensive circuit implementation, many \nsystems employ interpolative SDMs to perform analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversions \n[Janssen, 2003]. \nBy modeling the quantizer as a white noise source and properly designing the \nloop filter, the magnitude of the noise transfer function can be very small at the signal \nband. This design method is called the noise shaping technique [Janssen, 2003]. \nHowever, small magnitude of the noise transfer function at the signal band sometimes \ndoes not guarantee a good performance of the SDM, in particular, when the state \nvectors of the SDM is suffered from divergence and limit cycle problems. This is \nbecause the noise shaping technique assumes that the quantization noise is independent \nof the input of the quantizer. Nevertheless, the quantization noise is input dependent. \nHence, the noise shaping technique cannot explain the occurrence of some nonlinear \nbehaviors, such as limit cycle [Hein at al., 1993], fractal [Ashwin, 2003; Davies, 1997; \nFeely, 1997; Petkov, 1997] and chaotic [Hein, 1993; Schreier, 1994] behaviors, as well \nas the divergence of the system states when the linearized closed loop transfer function \nof the SDM is stable [Schreier, 1993; Steiner, 1997]. If a SDM exhibits the divergent \nbehavior for some initial conditions, then when electric shocking occurs, the current \nstate vectors of the SDM will probably be excited to those states that lead to the \ndivergent behavior. In this case, the SDM will be damaged. For some applications, such \nas audio application, the occurrence of the limit cycle behavior may result to annoying \naudio tone [Reefman, 2002]. We can see that both the limit cycle and divergent \nbehaviors would cause a degradation of the performance of the SDM, so the occurrence \nof these behaviors should be avoided. It is well known that limit cycle [Hein at al., 1993] \nand divergent behaviors [Schreier, 1993; Steiner, 1997] usually occur especially in high \norder SDMs whereas high order SDMs can produce very small magnitudes of the noise \ntransfer functions at the signal bands. Even for second order lowpass SDMs, these \nproblems still exist [Wang, 1992; Farrell, 1998] when the input magnitudes are at large \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 3 \nor intermediate levels. \nAlthough some existing control strategies, such as clipping [Reefman, 2002], \nhave been proposed to limit the maximum absolute value of the state variables, it may \nresult to the occurrence of limit cycles. This situation usually occurs when the input \nsignal is very slow time varying and the value of the clipped level is very small. To \navoid the occurrence of limit cycles, dithering has been proposed [Magrath, 1995]. \nHowever, dithering would increase the circuit complexity and the implementation cost. \nIn this paper, we employ a simple SDM that guarantees both the global stability \nproperty and the avoidance of the limit cycle behavior. Here, the global stability \nproperty refers to the property of the SDM that the state variables are bounded for all \ninitial conditions in the state space. \nIt was discussed in [Ashwin, 2003] that if second order bandpass interpolative \nSDMs exhibit fractal behaviors [Ashwin, 2003], then an invariant set [Ashwin, 2003], \n[G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk, 2004; Schreier at al., 1997; Thao, 2002, 2004] exists for these SDMs. It was \nalso found by [Ashwin, 2003] that some of these SDMs achieve the global stability. On \nthe other hand, it was reported in [G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk, 2004; Schreier at al., 1997; Thao, 2002, \n2004] that the existence of an invariant set as well as some other conditions will \nguarantee the global stability property. However, the global stability conditions in \n[G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk, 2004; Schreier at al., 1997; Thao, 2002, 2004] are not satisfied for second \norder bandpass interpolative SDMs. This is because the SDM studied in [G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk, \n2004; Schreier at al., 1997; Thao, 2002, 2004] are based on feedbackward structures, in \nwhich these results cannot directly be applied to the second order bandpass \ninterpolative SDMs with loop filters having arbitrarily filter coefficients. It was found \nby [Ho, 2006] that some of second order bandpass interpolative SDMs may exhibit the \ndivergent behavior if the frequency spectrum of the input of the loop filter contains an \nimpulse located at the natural frequency of the loop filter. This implies that the global \nstability of second order bandpass interpolative SDMs is not universally guaranteed \nand the global stability of these SDMs is still opened. One of the objectives of this \npaper is to address this issue. The global stability conditions for these second order \nbandpass interpolative SDMs is analyzed by the root locus approach [Baird, 1994]. \nMoreover, we numerically show that these SDMs may also exhibit irregular and \nconical-like chaotic patterns on the phase plane. For these two behaviors, the global \nstability property of these SDMs has not been investigated yet. \nIn this paper, the difference between the fractal and irregular or conical-like \nchaotic behaviors is also investigated. It was reported in [Ashwin, 2003] that if the filter \nparameter of a second order bandpass interpolative SDM is within a certain range, then \nfractal behavior will occur. However, the relationship between the occurrence of the \nfractal behavior and the magnitude of the input signal has not exploited yet. In this \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 4 \npaper, we investigate this relationship. The importance of studying this relationship is \nto provide some guidelines for SDM engineers to operate these SDMs, so that the \noccurrence of unwanted behaviors can be avoided and high tonal suppression can be \nobtained. \nThe outline of this paper is as follows. Notations are introduced in Section II. In \nSection III, analytical and simulated results are presented. Finally, a conclusion is \ndrawn in Section IV. \n \nII. NOTATIONS \nWe assume that the loop filter is causal and rational with real valued coefficients \nand a unit delay element multiplied by the numerator of the transfer function. We make \nthis assumption because of the feedback loop configuration. Hence, the transfer \nfunction of the second order loop filter can be denoted as: \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf02911\n11\n11\n1\n\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf0a2\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf0ba\nazza\nbzGzzF , (1) \nwhere a  and a\uf0a2  are the poles, b  is the zero and G  is related to the DC gain of the loop \nfilter. Since the input signal is oversampled, the input is very slow time varying and we \ncan approximate it as a DC signal.

MAIN RESULTS \nA. Magnitude response of the loop filter in a second order bandpass interpolative SDM \nNow, let us consider the second order bandpass interpolative SDM discussed in \n[Ashwin, 2003; Davies, 1997; Feely, 1997; Petkov, 1997], where the parameters of the \nfilter are \uf071cos2\uf03dG , \uf071jea \uf03d , \uf071jea \uf02d\uf03d\uf0a2  and \n\uf071cos2\n1\n\uf03db , in which \uf071  is the natural \nfrequency of the loop filter. Although the bandpass filter is employed, the magnitude \nresponse of the bandpass filter is close to that of the lowpass filter when \uf071  is very close \nto zero, in particular, when \uf071\uf077 2\uf0b3 . Hence, the magnitude response of the lowpass \nfilter can be approximated by the bandpass filter with the natural frequency very close \nto zero. Here, very close to zero means that \uf071  is much smaller than \nR\n\uf070 . Figure 2 shows \nthe magnitude responses of a second order bandpass filter with 001.0\uf03d\uf071  and a second \norder lowpass filter with 1\uf03d\uf0a2\uf03d aa , \n2\n1\n\uf03db  and 2\uf03dG . It can be seen from Figure 2 that \nthe magnitude responses of these two filters are almost the same when \uf071\uf077 2\uf0b3 . \nB. Global stability property of the second order bandpass interpolative SDM \nAs discussed in Section I that an invariant set exists for a class of second order \nbandpass interpolative SDMs [Ashwin, 2003] when this class of SDMs exhibits fractal \nbehaviors. Also, some of these SDMs will be globally stable. However, this property \nhas not been proved in [Ashwin, 2003]. Moreover, the global stability condition has not \nbeen investigated yet if fractal behaviors do not occur. In this subsection, we will \naddress the following issues: First, what are the general global stability conditions for \nthese SDMs? Second, do invariant sets exist when these SDMs do not exhibit fractal \nbehavior? Third, will the state vectors move towards these invariant sets when these \nSDMs do not exhibit fractal behavior? To address the first problem, we have the \nfollowing result. \nLemma 1 \nFor the class of second order bandpass interpolative SDMs discussed in [Ashwin, \n2003], if the ratio of the output of the SDM to the output of the loop filter tends to zero \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 6 \nas well as the frequency spectrum of the input of the loop filter contains an impulse \nlocated at the natural frequency of the loop filter, then this SDM will diverge. \nProof: \nTo prove this lemma, the root locus approach [Baird, 1994] is employed. That is, \nthe quantizer is modeled as an amplifier with variable gain K . \nAs \uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029ky\nksK \uf0ba  and \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029 \uf07b \uf07d1,1 \uf02d\uf0ce\uf03d kyQks  0\uf0b3\uf022k , 0\uf03eK .

It can be checked easily that if 2\n1cos \uf03c\uf071  and \n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf071\n\uf071\ncos21\ncos12\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf03eK , then 1\uf03eK  and \uf028 \uf029 11 \uf03eK\uf06c . If 2\n1cos \uf02d\uf03e\uf071  and \uf028 \uf029\n1cos2\n1cos2\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf03e\n\uf071\n\uf071K , then \n1\uf03eK  and \uf028 \uf029 12 \uf02d\uf03cK\uf06c . Since \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n1cos2\n1cos2\ncos21\ncos12\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf03c\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf071\n\uf071\n\uf071\n\uf071  for \n2\n1cos0 \uf02d\uf03e\uf03e \uf071  and vice \nversa for 0cos\n2\n1\n\uf03e\uf03e \uf071 , by combining all these conditions, the stability of the \nlinearized closed loop transfer function is summarized as follows: \nIf \uf028 \uf029\n\uf071\n\uf071\ncos21\ncos12\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf03eK  and 0cos \uf03c\uf071 , or \uf028 \uf029\n1cos2\n1cos2\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf03e\n\uf071\n\uf071K  and 0cos \uf03e\uf071 , then the \nlinearized closed loop transfer function will be unstable. If 0\uf03dK , or 0cos \uf03d\uf071  and \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 2\n1cos2\n1cos2\ncos21\ncos12\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf071\n\uf071\n\uf071\n\uf071K , or \uf028 \uf029\n\uf071\n\uf071\ncos21\ncos12\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf03dK  and 0cos \uf03c\uf071 , or \n\uf028 \uf029\n1cos2\n1cos2\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\n\uf071\n\uf071K  and 0cos \uf03e\uf071 , then the linearized closed loop transfer function will be \nmarginally stable. Otherwise, the linearized closed loop transfer function will be \nstrictly stable. The stability region is shown in Figure 3. \nAs \uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029ky\nksK \uf0ba  and \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029 \uf07b \uf07d1,1 \uf02d\uf0ce\uf03d kyQks , \uf028 \uf029ky  is unbounded if and only if \n\uf02b\uf0ae 0K . Hence, the stability analysis can be performed by only considering the case \nwhen \uf02b\uf0ae 0K . It is worth noting that this linear approach is applied even though it is \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 7 \nemployed for the analysis of a nonlinear system. When \uf02b\uf0ae 0K , the linearized closed \nloop transfer function is marginally stable. For any bounded input \uf028 \uf029ku , the input of the \nloop filter is bounded because \uf028 \uf029ks  is bounded. As the SDM consists of the marginally \nstable loop filter, the only possible cause for \uf028 \uf029ky  being unbounded is the resonance \neffect. That is, the frequency spectrum of the input of the loop filter contains an impulse \nlocated at the natural frequency of the loop filter. This completes the proof. \uf06e \nFrom the above, we can see that large value of \uf028 \uf029ky  corresponds to small value \nof K . If \uf028 \uf029ky  is large and \uf02b\uf0ae 0K , then the linearized closed loop transfer function is \nmarginally stable. If the frequency spectrum of the input of the loop filter contains an \nimpulse located at the natural frequency of the loop filter, then the state vectors will \ndiverge. \nAs fractal behaviors could be exhibited for a class of second order bandpass \ninterpolative SDMs, we can understand the exhibitions of fractal behaviors from the \nabove root locus analysis. It is worth noting that small values of \uf028 \uf029ky  correspond to \nlarge value of K  and an unstable linearized closed loop transfer function. Hence, for \nsmall values of \uf028 \uf029ky , the state vectors will move outwards from the region around the \norigin. On the other hand, large values of \uf028 \uf029ky  correspond to small value of K  and a \nstrictly stable linearized closed loop transfer function if K  does not tend to zero. Hence, \nfor large values of \uf028 \uf029ky , the state vectors will move towards the region around the \norigin. Hence, the state vectors will move in and out of the region around the origin \nagain and again. This accounts for the occurrence of the fractal and irregular chaotic \nbehaviors. \nTo investigate whether an invariant set exists for the SDM when the SDM does \nnot exhibit the fractal behavior, we need to recall the definition of an invariant set \n[Ashwin, 2003], [G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk, 2004; Schreier at al., 1997; Thao, 2002, 2004]. Denote a \nmap G  which maps from a set \uf047  to itself. That is, \uf047\uf0ae\uf047:G . If \uf028 \uf029 \uf047\uf03d\uf047G , then \uf047  is \ncalled an invariant set. Denote \u00d8 as the empty set. \nLemma 2 \nDenote \n\uf05b \uf05d \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d\n\uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf0ef\uf0fe\n\uf0ef\n\uf0fd\n\uf0fc\n\uf0ef\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\uf0ba\uf047\uf0ce\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf047\uf0cf\uf02d\uf047\uf0ce\uf02d\uf02b\uf0ba\n\uf0ba\uf047\n.cos21cos2  where,,\nand ,0,2,:,\n1121\n121\n\uf071\uf071 uxxQxxxxxQ\nxQQxx\nT\nTT xxuBAxx\n.

Hence, \uf047\uf0ce\uf022y , \uf047\uf0ce\uf024x  such that \uf028 \uf029 yx \uf03dG . This \nimplies that \uf028 \uf029 \uf047\uf0ca\uf047G . Therefore, \uf028 \uf029 \uf047\uf03d\uf047G  and \uf047 is an invariant set under the system \nmap G . This completes the proof. \uf06e \nThere are some conventional approaches to test whether a set of state vectors of a \nSDM is an invariant set or not. One of the conventional approaches is based on the \ngeometric property of the set. Although this conventional approach can be applied for \nthose SDMs which exhibit the fractal behavior, because the corresponding set consists \nof trapezoids, this conventional approach cannot be applied if the shape of the sets is \nirregular. In fact, we will show numerically at the end of this subsection that a bandpass \nSDM may exhibit irregular and conical-like chaotic patterns on the phase plane. By \napplying Lemma 2, we can conclude that these sets are invariant sets because Lemma 2 \nis satisfied for these cases. \nTo investigate whether some state vectors, which are initially not inside the \ninvariant set \uf047 , will eventually move towards the invariant set \uf047  if the invariant set \uf047  \nexists, the injective property of  G  has to be investigated. However, in general, the \nexistence of invariant sets does not imply that the corresponding system maps are \ninjective. Consider the following counter-example: Define \uf05b \uf05d \uf05b \uf05d1,01,0: \uf0aef  as a map \nsuch that \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0291,2mod xxf \uf03d , where mod  is denoted as the modulo operator. Obviously, \n\uf05b \uf05d1,0  is an invariant set under the map f , but f  is not injective. \nLemma 3 \nSuppose that \uf0b9\uf047 \u00d8. Then G  is bijective. \nProof: \nFrom Lemma 2, we have \uf028 \uf029 \uf047\uf03d\uf047G . This implies that G  is surjective. To show \nthat G  is injective, denote \uf05b \uf05dTxx 12111 ,\uf0bax  and \uf05b \uf05dTxx 22212 ,\uf0bax .

This completes the proof. \uf06e \nCorollary 1 provides information on how the initial condition moves towards the \ninvariant set \uf047 . \nBeside, some interesting phenomena are found. First of all, fractal patterns are \nnot the only type of chaotic patterns exhibited in the phase plane. The SDM may exhibit \nirregular and conical-like chaotic patterns. Figure 5a and 5b show the phase portraits \nwhen \uf028 \uf029 0x \uf03d0 , 3.0\uf02d\uf03du , \uf028 \uf029158532.0cos 1\uf02d\uf03d\uf071 , and \uf028 \uf029 0x \uf03d0 , 5.0\uf03du , 1.0\uf03d\uf071 , \nrespectively.

It can be seen from Figure 5a, 5b and 5c that fractal, irregular and \nconical-like chaotic patterns are exhibited on the phase plane, respectively. However, \nno matter what type of chaotic patterns is, an invariant set exists. By dividing the phase \nportraits, shown in Figure 6a, 6c and 6e, into four subportraits, it can be seen, \nrespectively, in Figure 6b, 6d and 6f, that the union of the mapped regions generates the \noriginal phase portraits with the same outer boundaries. \nThe second interesting phenomenon is that \uf03d\uf047\uf047 S\\ \u00d8 when the SDM exhibits \nfractal patterns, while \uf0b9\uf047\uf047 S\\ \u00d8 when the SDM exhibits irregular and conical-like \nchaotic patterns.

We will show in Subsection IIID that the conditions for exhibiting fractal \nbehaviors are \n2\n1cos \uf03c\uf071  and \uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\n\uf03c\n\uf071\n\uf071\ncos21\ncos21,1minu , and the absolute values of the \nfirst co-ordinate of these four state vectors is bounded by 2. Note that these two \ntrapezoids are in S\uf047 . Hence, S\uf047\uf03d\uf047  and \uf03d\uf047\uf047 S\\ \u00d8. However, this property does not \nhold for the cases when irregular and conical-like chaotic patterns are exhibited on the \nphase plane. The red regions shown in Figure 7a and 7c correspond to S\uf047 , while the \nblue region shown in Figure 7c corresponds to S\uf047\uf047 \\ . The red regions shown in Figure \n7b and 7d correspond to R\uf047 , while the blue region shown in Figure 7d corresponds to \nR\uf047\uf047 \\ . It can be seen in Figure 7a and 7b that there is no blue region in the phase \nportraits, which implies that \uf03d\uf047\uf047 S\\ \u00d8 when the SDMs exhibit fractal patterns. \nC.

Moreover, from statement (i) of Lemma 7, we can see that the output sequence is \nperiodic with period M . Furthermore, from statement (iii) of Lemma 7, we can see that \nthe shape of the set of the initial conditions is elliptic. \nThere are three main important implications and two interesting phenomena that \ncan be accounted from Lemma 7. The first important implication of Lemma 7 is that for \na given initial condition in the trapezoids, Lemma 7 provides information to test \nwhether a limit cycle occurs or not. This can be done by checking whether the given \ninitial condition is inside the ellipses of the fractal patterns or not. If it is inside the \nellipses, then a limit cycle occurs, and vice versa. \nThe second important implication of Lemma 7 is to estimate the periodicity of the \nlimit cycle. Since the periodicity is defined based on the behavior over an infinite \namount of time, but only a finite number of observable output bits are obtained from \npractical situations, in general, it is not trivial to check whether an output sequence is \nperiodic or not. Even though the output sequence is periodic, it is not easy to estimate \nits periodicity. However, according to Lemma 7, the periodicity of the output sequence \ncan be estimated by counting the number of the ellipses exhibiting on the phase plane or \ncounting the number of the elliptical sets of initial conditions. \nThe third important implication of Lemma 7 is to provide information whether a \nlimit cycle is stable or not. If a given initial condition is strictly inside an elliptical set of \ninitial conditions, a small perturbation of the initial condition will give rise to a similar \nelliptic trajectory pattern and the same periodic output sequence as well. Hence, the \ncorresponding trajectory for the limit cycle is regarded as locally stable. However, if the \ninitial condition is on the boundary of the elliptical set, a small perturbation of the initial \ncondition will give rise to a very different dynamical behavior and output sequence. In \nthis case, the trajectory for the limit cycle is regarded as locally unstable. \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 16 \nThere are two interesting phenomena that can be explained by Lemma 7. First, \nwhen 1\uf03dM , \uf02a0x  is on the diagonal line. Since the output sequence is constant, all the \nstate vectors are in the same quadrant. Hence, the trajectory and the set of initial \nconditions are confined either in quadrant I or quadrant III, and cannot cut across the \nprinciple axes. For 1\uf0b3M , by downsampling the output sequence by M , the output \nsequence becomes constant. Hence, the trajectory of each ellipse and each elliptical set \nof initial conditions also cannot cut across the principle axes. \nSecond, the occurrence of periodic output sequence does not imply the \noccurrence of periodic state variables [Ling, 2003]. In general the state variables are \nperiodic if \uf071  is a rational multiple of \uf070 . \nD. Conditions for the second order bandpass interpolative SDM exhibiting fractal \nbehavior \nNow, we present the results for the class of second order bandpass interpolative \nSDMs discussed in [Ashwin, 2003] which exhibits fractal behaviors. The conditions for \nthe occurrence of fractal behaviors are presented below. \nLemma 8 \nIf \n2\n1cos \uf03c\uf071 , (21) \n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\n\uf03c\n\uf071\n\uf071\ncos21\ncos21,1minu , (22) \n\uf028 \uf029ks  are aperiodic and \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf055\n1\n\\0\n\uf0b3\n\uf053\uf047\uf0ce\nM\nMx , (23) \nthen \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf055\n1\n\\\n\uf0b3\n\uf053\uf047\uf0ce\nM\nMkx , for 0\uf0b3k . (24) \nProof: \nIt can be proved using the approach discussed in [Ashwin, 2003]. \uf06e \nAlthough this lemma can be proved using the approach discussed in [Ashwin, \n2003], the effects of the input step size and the initial conditions to the exhibition of \nelliptic fractal patterns have not been explored in [Ashwin, 2003] yet. Lemma 8 \naddresses these issues. We can see from Lemma 8 that elliptic fractal patterns will occur \nwhen the filter parameter satisfies the condition stated in equation (21), the input step \nsize is kept below the bound defined in equation (22) and the initial condition satisfies \nequation (23). Note that when the magnitude of u  is larger than the bound defined in \nequation (22), or when the filter parameters are not in the range defined by equation (21) \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 17 \nor when the initial conditions are not in the set defined in equation (23) but still in the \ntrapezoids, then Lemma 8 will not be satisfied and elliptic fractal pattern will not be \nexhibited in the phase plane. \nThe importance of Lemma 7 and Lemma 8 is that they provide information for \nSDM designers to operate the SDMs so that the occurrences of limit cycle and fractal \nbehaviors can be avoided. Hence, annoying audio tones will not be observed if these \nSDMs are employed for audio application [Reefman, 2002]. \nE. Performance of the second order bandpass interpolative SDM \nIn the following simulations, we assume that 64\uf03dR  because it is the most \ncommon oversampling ratio employed in audio application [Reefman, 2002]. As \ndiscussed in Subsection IIIA, the natural frequency of a second order bandpass \ninterpolative SDM should be small, we choose 001.0\uf03d\uf071 , which is 2.0372% of the \nsignal bandwidth \nR\n\uf070 . In order to compare the performances of the second order \nlowpass and bandpass interpolative SDMs, the second order lowpass interpolative \nSDM with 1\uf03d\uf0a2\uf03d aa , \n2\n1\n\uf03db  and 2\uf03dG  are set because the magnitude response of this \nlowpass SDM  is close to that of the bandpass SDM. We first employ \uf028 \uf029 0x \uf03d0  for \nsimulations because \u201cinitially at rest\u201d is the most common practical situations. Then, \nwe check if the conditions for exhibiting limit cycles and fractal behaviors stated in \nSection IIIC and Section IIID, respectively, are satisfied or not. If none of these \nconditions is satisfied, then we will employ this initial condition. Otherwise, we \ngenerate another initial condition randomly and check it again. We repeat this checking \nprocedure for no more than 100 iterations. Note that only less than 100 iterations are \nchecked because this can prevent trapping into a dead loop of the generation of the \ninitial conditions. \nIn order to compare the performance of the lowpass and the bandpass SDMs, \ntonal suppression and SNR are used as the criteria. Tonal suppression reflects the \nability of the avoidance of annoying audio tones and SNR reflects the reconstruction \nerrors of the A\/D and D\/A conversions. We define the tonal suppression as: \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf07b \uf07d\n\uf028 \uf029\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf077\uf070\uf077\nS\nS\nTS\n0\\,0\n0\n0 max\n\uf0ce\n\uf0ba . (25) \nFigure 8a and Figure 8b show the tonal suppression of the lowpass SDM, denoted as \n\uf028 \uf0290\uf077lowpassTS , and that of the bandpass SDM, denoted as \uf028 \uf0290\uf077bandpassTS , respectively. \nFigure 8c shows the ratio of the improvement of the tonal suppression, that is \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 18 \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf0290\n00\n\uf077\n\uf077\uf077\nlowpass\nlowpassbandpass\nTS\nTSTS \uf02d\n. It can be seen from Figure 8c that there are many positive \nspikes, which implies that the bandpass SDM has higher tonal suppression than the \nlowpass SDM for most frequencies and input magnitudes. Besides, Figure 9 shows the \nmagnitude spectra of the output sequences of the lowpass and bandpass SDMs when \nthe DC input with the step size 7.0\uf03du  is applied under the zero initial condition \n\uf028 \uf029 0x \uf03d0 . It can be seen from Figure 9 that there are impulses in the magnitude spectrum \nof the output sequence of the lowpass SDM, which demonstrates that the lowpass SDM \nexhibits the limit cycle behavior. On the other hand, the bandpass SDM operates \nnormally. \nThe definition of the SNR adopt in this paper is based on that defined in [Schreier, \n2003]. Figure 10 shows the SNRs of the lowpass and bandpass SDMs under the same \noversampling ratios, that is, 64\uf03dR , and operating conditions. That is, we assume that \nthe frequency of the sinusoidal input is \n3\n2  of the signal bandwidth \nR\n\uf070 . According to \nFigure 10, we can see that the lowpass SDM can only achieve an average of 66.1751dB \nfor an input magnitude less than or equal to 1.06, and 9.2952dB for that between 1.07 \nand 2. On the other hand, the bandpass SDM can achieve an average of 80.7934dB for \nan input magnitude less than or equal to 1.16 , and 12.0046dB for that between 1.17 and \n2 by using our checking procedures. Hence, the bandpass SDM have an average of \n14.6183dB and 2.7094dB improvements for low and high input magnitudes, \nrespectively, as well as an increasing the input stability margin of 0.1. These results \nshow that the bandpass SDM with the natural frequency very close to zero can achieve \na higher SNR than that of the lowpass SDM, and our derived conditions for checking \nthe exhibition of limit cycle and fractal behaviors are useful for operating the bandpass \nSDM. \n \nIV. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we propose to replace a second order lowpass interpolative SDM by \na second order bandpass interpolative SDM with the natural frequency of the loop filter \nvery close to zero. If the natural frequency of the bandpass SDM is smaller than the \nvalue which depends on the oversampling ratio, then the magnitude response of the \nbandpass SDM will be close to that of the lowpass SDM. The main advantages of \nemploying the bandpass SDM are that the global stability of the SDM can be \nguaranteed if the frequency spectrum of the input of the loop filter does not contain an \nimpulse located at the natural frequency of the loop filter. Moreover, the conditions for \nthe occurrence of limit cycle and fractal behaviors are derived, so these unwanted \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 19 \nbehaviors can be avoided accordingly. Simulation results show that the bandpass SDM \ncan achieve higher SNR and tonal suppression than that of the lowpass SDM. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe work obtained in this paper was supported by a research grant from Queen \nMary, University of London. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] Ashwin, P., Fu, X.
