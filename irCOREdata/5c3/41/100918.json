INTRODUCTION\nThe odd-odd deformed nuclide 18075Re105 is located in the\nhigh-Z part of the well-deformed A \u223c 160\u2212180 region of\nthe Segre` chart. Nuclei in this region have high-K orbitals\nclose to the Fermi surface (where K is the spin projection on\nthe symmetry axis). Broken-pair states at modest excitation\nenergies can have high K values and are able to compete\nwith collective rotation in the formation of the yrast line (the\nlocus of states with lowest energy as a function of spin) [1,2].\nThe approximate conservation of the K quantum number then\nleads to long-lived isomers, exemplified by the \u03c4 = 45-yr mean\nlife of a K\u03c0 = 16+, four-quasiparticle isomer in 17872Hf106 [3].\nHowever, for different nucleon numbers, the mean lives of\nmultiquasiparticle states are seen to decrease rapidly, because\nof a combination of less-favorable energetics and increased K\nmixing [2]. Considering quasiparticle numbers \u00014 in the Z =\n76 osmium isotopes, for example, the longest-lived isomers\nhave mean lives in the ns range, while \u00b5s isomers are known\nin the Z = 75 rhenium isotopes 179Re [4] and 181Re [5]. The\npresent work is concerned with the study of isomers and\nassociated structures in their odd-odd neighbor 180Re, which\ncould give additional information about the robustness of the\nK quantum number.\nLow-spin states in 180Re have been studied previously\nthrough the electron-capture decay of 180Os [6\u20139]. The 180Re\nground state is unstable, with \u03c4 = 3.5 min and a tentative\nspin and parity of (1)\u2212. It decays by electron capture to\nthe stable nuclide 180W. The high-spin states of 180Re have\nbeen investigated twice [10,11] in the past two decades, but\nthe experiments failed to agree on common spin, parity, and\nconfiguration assignments, even for the low-lying states. The\n\u2217Electronic address: p.walker@surrey.ac.uk\nfirst experiment [10] used the 176Yb(10B,6n) reaction and\nobtained a level scheme up to high spin in which five rotational\nbands were identified and interpreted as being part of 180Re,\neven though there were no connections with the low-spin part\nof the level scheme [8,9]. A four-quasiparticle isomer was\nalso reported, with associated rotational bands. The second\nhigh-spin experiment [11] used two different beam and target\ncombinations, 181Ta(\u03b1,5n) and 170Er(14N,4n), and established\nthe existence of six strongly coupled rotational bands and\na seventh band which showed a significant energy splitting\nbetween the sequences of different signature. The four-\nquasiparticle isomer was confirmed, and higher-lying isomers\nwere reported but not characterized. Again, connections with\nthe low-spin states were not identified, and spin assignments\nremained tentative. The interpretations of the two data sets\n[10,11] differed substantially.\nThe structures of the two-quasiparticle bands have been\nreinterpreted by Jain et al. [12]. The present work builds\non this, reports new connections between the known bands,\nextends those bands to higher spin, and identifies two six-\nquasiparticle bands for the first time. Despite these successes,\nconnections with the low-spin states, populated in electron-\ncapture decay, remain unidentified. Nevertheless, a consistent\nunderstanding of the high-spin level structure is provided,\nup to spin values of almost 30h\u00af. The highest-lying isomer,\nwith \u03c4 = 13 \u00b1 1 \u00b5s, is assigned an I\u03c0 = K\u03c0 = 21\u2212 six-\nquasiparticle structure. Its K-forbidden decay provides insight\ninto the persistence of the K quantum number. The present\nwork supersedes a preliminary report [13] of the four- and\nsix-quasiparticle results.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nThe nuclide 180Re was populated up to spin \u223c30h\u00af with a\n71 MeV beam of 11B ions incident on a self-supporting 174Yb\n0556-2813\/2005\/72(5)\/054306(22)\/$23.00 054306-1 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society\nH. M. EL-MASRI et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 72, 054306 (2005)\ntarget of thickness 5 mg\/cm2. The choice of beam energy\nwas based on calculations using the code PACE [14] and by\ninspection of the experimental \u03b3 -ray spectra at different beam\nenergies. Although the evaporation of five neutrons constituted\nthe main channel at 71 MeV, \u03b3 rays from other nuclides\nwere also observed, principally 181Re and 179Re, via the 4n\nand 6n channels, respectively. The \u03b3 -ray measurements were\nmade using the CAESAR detector array [15], consisting of\nsix Compton-suppressed n-type coaxial HPGe detectors (with\na BGO shield surrounding each detector) mounted at angles\nof \u00b148\u25e6,\u00b197\u25e6, and \u00b1145\u25e6 with respect to the beam axis, and\ntwo small-volume unsuppressed planar Ge detectors (LEPS) at\n\u00b145\u25e6 used for enhanced sensitivity to low-energy \u03b3 rays and\nx rays. The array was operated in both singles and coincidence\nmode.\nFor measuring conversion electrons, the Super-e electron\nspectrometer [16] was used, consisting of a superconducting\nmagnet transporter and a Si(Li) detector with an antipositron\nbaffle. This was operated in lens mode, with the baffle system\nrestricting the momentum acceptance. In the current work,\ntwo electron-energy ranges were studied, 200\u2013900 and 400\u2013\n600 keV. To measure the \u03b3 -ray spectrum simultaneously\nwith the conversion electrons, a Compton-suppressed HPGe\ndetector was installed at 135\u25e6 to the beam direction. Efficiency\nand energy calibrations were performed for each of the two\nexperimental arrangements (CAESAR and Super-e) using a\n152Eu radioactive source at the target position.\nA. \u03b3 -ray measurements\n\u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidence measurements were performed with 1 ns\nbeam pulses, 1.7 \u00b5s apart. A total of 3 \u00d7 108 coincidence\nevents were sorted into a variety of 4096 \u00d7 4096-channel\nmatrices. For example, one matrix had the requirement that\nthe \u03b3 rays occur within \u00b140 ns of each other. Another had\nthe time relationship relaxed to \u00b1170 ns, thus including low-\nenergy \u03b3 rays and x-rays, which can experience considerable\ntime walk. Additional conditions that the events occur during\nthe beam pulses, or between beam pulses, have been used.\nTo study across-isomer correlations, early-delayed matrices\nwere constructed in two time-difference regimes, 40\u2013170 and\n170\u2013800 ns. Projection of those events that precede an isomer\nwas achieved by gating on transitions that follow it, and vice\nversa.\nTwo three-dimensional matrices (cubes) were sorted for\ndetailed time analysis. For states depopulated by low-energy\n\u03b3 rays, a \u03b3 -x-\u0005t cube was constructed, with HPGe-detector\nevents on one axis, LEPS events on the second axis, and\nthe time difference between them on the third axis. A corre-\nsponding \u03b3 -\u03b3 -\u0005t cube was also constructed. The background-\nsubtracted spectra were then obtained by projecting onto the\ntime axis with gates on the \u03b3 rays which populated and\ndepopulated the levels of interest. This enabled lifetimes in\nthe ns \u2192 \u00b5s range to be associated with specific states.\nTo measure longer lifetimes, separate measurements were\nperformed with two different \u00b5s-pulsing ranges. One was with\nthe beam on for 7 \u00b5s and off for 107 \u00b5s, and the other with\nthe beam on for 53 \u00b5s and off for 802 \u00b5s. \u03b3 -ray energies\nand their times relative to the beam pulses were recorded in\nevent-by-event mode, and two-dimensional \u03b3 -time matrices\nwere created.\nThe DCO (directional correlation of oriented states) tech-\nnique was used to aid spin determinations. The DCO ratio may\nbe defined as [17]\nRDCO =\nI\n\u03b3 2\n\u03b81\n(\nGate\u03b3\n1\n\u03b82\n)\nI\n\u03b3 2\n\u03b82\n(\nGate\u03b3\n1\n\u03b81\n) , (1)\nwhere I represents the \u03b3 -ray intensity, and \u03b81 and \u03b82 are the\nangles between each detector and the beam axis. DCO ratios\nwere extracted for the present geometry with \u03b81 = 145\u25e6, and\n\u03b82 = 97\u25e6. If the two transitions in the cascade have the same\nmultipolarity, then gating on either of them gives RDCO \u2248 1.\nHowever, gating on a stretched quadrupole transition gives\nRDCO \u2248 0.56 for a stretched dipole transition and gives\nvalues ranging from RDCO \u2248 0.3 to \u22481.2 for mixed M1\/E2\ntransitions, depending on the spin change and the size and\nsign of the mixing ratio. Measured DCO ratios are included in\nTable I.\nB. Conversion-electron measurements\nThe conversion-electron experiment was carried out using\na pulsed beam, with 7 \u00b5s pulses separated by 107 \u00b5s. Data\nwere collected only in the off-beam period with the Si(Li) and\nHPGe detectors and sorted into two matrices, one with electron\nenergy against the time of arrival relative to the beam pulse,\nand the other with the \u03b3 -ray energy against time.\nThe electron events were subjected to momentum-selection\ncriteria [16]. After recording the full electron spectrum\nfrom the Si(Li) detector, events were selected which satisfy\nthe defined relationship between the electron energy and\nthe solenoid field. The energy-dependent time response of\nelectrons and \u03b3 rays was corrected, and matched spectra were\nproduced. Conversion coefficients were obtained directly from\nthe ratios of efficiency-corrected electron and \u03b3 -ray intensities.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nEleven rotational bands have been identified in the present\nwork, based on two-, four-, and six-quasiparticle configura-\ntions. The level scheme is presented in two parts. Figure 1\nshows two-quasiparticle bands 1, 2, and 3; and Fig. 2 shows\ntwo-quasiparticle bands 3, 4, and 11 together with the four-\nand six-quasiparticle bands. For clarity, band 3 is reproduced in\nboth figures. The \u03b3 -ray energies and intensities for transitions\nassigned to 180Re are listed in Table I, while conversion\ncoefficients are listed in Table II. Representative singles spectra\nfor conversion electrons and \u03b3 rays are shown in Fig. 3. In\naddition to the conversion coefficients obtained directly from\nthe ratio of the electron and \u03b3 -ray intensities, for low-energy\ntransitions the total conversion coefficients have been ex-\ntracted from transition intensity balances.

Jain et al. [12] considered signature splittings, g fac-\ntors, systematics from neighboring nuclei, bandhead energies\n(including residual interactions) and quasiparticle alignments\nto establish reliable and consistent configurations for these\ntwo-quasiparticle bands. Our experimental and theoretical\nresults (see Sec. IV) for bands 4 and 11 are in good accord\nwith the conclusions of Jain et al., and hence these two bands\nare used as the foundation for constructing the rest of the\nlevel scheme. Although they do not have experimental spin\nassignments, their structures and spins are considered to be on\nfirm ground, and parentheses are not used for their spins and\nparities in the following presentation. Rather, parentheses are\nused to distinguish assignments that are tentative relative to\nbands 4 and 11.\nNilsson configuration assignments are suggested in the\nfollowing sections for each of the observed rotational bands.\nThese are proposed with the aid of multiquasiparticle calcu-\nlations (discussed later), and in each case care is taken that\nthe configuration should be consistent both with the degree\nof rotational alignment and with the experimental g factors.\nPlots of alignment as a function of rotational frequency are\nshown in Fig. 4.

Partial level scheme (part 1 of 2) of 180Re as deduced in the current work.\nwhere\t and\n are projections of the orbital and intrinsic spins,\nrespectively, with g\t = 0 for neutrons and 1 for protons. The\nfree nucleon values of g\n = \u22123.83 for neutrons and +5.59\nfor protons are attenuated by a factor of 0.6 [19], and Nilsson-\nmodel wave functions are used to determine the expectation\nvalues of the intrinsic-spin projections. Equation (2) assumes\na well-defined K value and only yields the magnitude of \u03b4\nand not its sign. In this work, the sign of (gK \u2212 gR) has not\nbeen determined, though positive signs have been previously\nobtained [11] from \u03b3 -ray angular distributions for bands 3,\n4, 8, and 11 (with K\u03c0 = 7+, 8+, 16+, and 9\u2212, respectively).\nNevertheless, it is not straightforward to make a quantitative\ncomparison with the resulting g factors from Ref. [11] on\naccount of the different K values that have been used.\nThe measured |gK \u2212 gR| values are listed in Table III\nand compared with corresponding theoretical values. There\nis reasonable agreement for all assigned bands (though not\nthe unassigned K\u03c0 = 4\u2212 option) providing support for the\nsuggested configurations. The last column in Table III lists\ncases where gK = 0.08 is used for i 13\n2\nneutrons [19], and\ngK = \u22121.0 is used for h 9\n2\nprotons [20]. These values allow for\nalignment effects and typically lead to improved agreement\nwith experimental values. At least part of the remaining\ndiscrepancies can be attributed to the assumption of fixed\ngR = 0.30. As observed for multiquasiparticle bands in, for\nexample, 178W [21] and 179W [19], there is evidence that the\nneutron-proton balance in the configuration has a significant\ninfluence on gR . The effect was quantified for the more\nextensive 178W data set [21], but it is not accounted for in\nthe present work.\nIt is also informative to make comparisons of 180Re band\nproperties (g factors and alignments) with corresponding bands\n054306-8\nHIGH-K STATES IN THE ODD-ODD NUCLIDE 180Re PHYSICAL REVIEW C 72, 054306 (2005)\nTABLE III.

Two-quasiparticle bands\n1. Band 4, K\u03c0 = 8+, based on the 205 keV level\nBand 4 was observed up to spin (19+) at 3234 keV. The\ncorresponding bandhead reported in Ref. [11] was given a spin\nassignment of 6\u2212, in contrast to the 7+ assignment of Kreiner\net al. [10] and the 8+ assignment of Jain et al. [12]. As indicated\nabove, the Jain et al. 8+ assignment is adopted here. There are\ntwo possible configurations: \u03bd7\/2\u2212[514] \u2297 \u03c09\/2\u2212[514], and\n\u03bd9\/2+[624] \u2297 \u03c07\/2+[404]. Of these quasiparticles, only the\n9\/2+[624] neutron gives substantial alignment. Therefore, the\nlow aligned angular momentum of the observed band at low\nfrequency (ix = 2h\u00af at h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.1 MeV, see Fig. 4) favors the\nformer configuration, which has no aligned quasiparticles. The\nadopted configuration is the same as for the K\u03c0 = 8+ band in\n178Ta, which has |gK \u2212 gR| = 0.47 \u00b1 0.05 [20], compared to\nthe 180Re value of 0.45 \u00b1 0.05. The alignment shows an initial\nupbend below h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.3 MeV, which is typically observed in\nthis mass region [22] for i 13\n2\nneutron pair breaking. However,\na complete alignment was not observed because of the lack\nof data on higher-spin states for this band. Note that band 8\n(K\u03c0 = 16+), which is discussed later, has a related neutron\n(i 13\n2\n)2 alignment.\n2. Band 11, K\u03c0 = 9\u2212, based on the 284 keV level\nBand 11 is assigned a bandhead spin of 9\u2212, based on\nthe discussion of Jain et al. [12], which is consistent with\nour results. (Kreiner et al. [10] gave an 8\u2212 assignment, and\nVenkova et al. [11] gave a 7+ assignment.) Note that there is\na 79 keV transition, assigned E1 character [11], from the 9\u2212\nbandhead of band 11 to the 8+ bandhead of band 4, and all\nauthors agree on the relative spin and parity assignments of\nbands 4 and 11. Band 11 is now extended to spin (25\u2212). The\nbandhead is isomeric with a measured mean life of 109 \u00b1 2 ns\n(see Fig. 5). This is consistent with previous results [10,11],\nthough the uncertainty is now reduced.\nJain et al. [12] gave a configuration assignment of\n\u03bd9\/2+[624] \u2297 \u03c09\/2\u2212[514], which is supported by the present\nwork. The initial alignment (Fig. 4) of ix = 3.5h\u00af at h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248\n0.1 MeV is consistent with the presence of an i 13\n2\nneutron in\nthe configuration. We note that there is competition between\nthe 9\/2+[624] and 7\/2+[633] i 13\n2\nneutron orbitals, which are\nmixed by the Coriolis interaction. However, it is evident from\nthe odd-N isotones 179W [19,23] and 181Os [24] that the\n9\/2+[624] neutron is at slightly lower energy for N = 105.\nThe band in 178Ta with the same configuration has |gK \u2212 gR| =\n0.29 \u00b1 0.03 [20], similar to the 180Re value of 0.25 \u00b1 0.03.\nThe alignment (Fig. 4) shows a backbend at h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248\n0.3 MeV, which is presumably due to the alignment of a pair\nof i 13\n2\nneutrons. Because of blocking, this alignment should be\ndelayed in frequency relative to bands without an i 13\n2\nneutron\nin the initial configuration. In 180Re, there is no good test of\nthis behavior. However, it can be seen that the alignment gain\nin band 4 (K\u03c0 = 8+) begins at a lower frequency, as would\nbe expected. Furthermore, these 8+ and 9\u2212 bands in 180Re\n054306-9\nH. M.

Partial level scheme (part 2 of 2) of 180Re as deduced in the current work.\nhave properties that are similar to the corresponding 8+ and\n9\u2212 bands in 178Ta [20].\nAdditional excited states, found to decay into lower\nmembers of band 11, are at 1403 keV (12\u2212) and\n1670 keV (13\u2212), the latter being newly placed in this work.\nThe 1670 keV state decays via a 1074 keV transition to the\n595 keV, I\u03c0 = 11\u2212 level. The I\u03c0 = (13\u2212) assignment is\nimplied because, when gating on the 1074 keV transition in\nthe \u03b3 -\u03b3 matrix, transitions are seen that feed the 1755 keV,\nI\u03c0 = 15\u2212 level, which suggests that there is an unobserved and\nhighly converted (E2) 85 keV transition between the I\u03c0 = 15\u2212\nstate and the state in question. The quasiparticle structures of\nthe 1403 and 1670 keV levels are considered in Sec. IV.\n3. Band 2, K\u03c0 = (4+), based on the ground state, and band 3,\nK\u03c0 = (7+), based on the 71 keV level\nBands 2 and 3 were previously reported in Ref. [11]. These\ntwo structures are connected by strong interband transitions\nwhich help in determining the energy and spin differences. An\nunobserved 25 keV transition is implied [11], depopulating\nthe bandhead of band 3. Nonobservation as a \u03b3 ray is\nnot surprising since an M1, 25 keV transition has a large\nconversion coefficient (\u03b1TOT = 55). In the present work, a\n45.8 keV transition has been established at the bottom of\nband 2 (see Fig. 6). This transition was reported in Ref. [10]\nbut not placed in their level scheme.\nBand 3 was assigned a 3\u2212 bandhead by Venkova et al. [11].\nThis clearly conflicts with our connection (see Fig. 2) to band 4,\nwhich was not identified by Venkova et al. [11], although they\ninferred the existence of a 42 keV transition on the basis of\n\u03b3 -ray coincidence relationships. Intensity considerations for\nthe 42.4 and 134.5 keV transitions from band 4 to band 3 imply\nM1 multipolarities and hence a 7+ bandhead for the latter.\nFurthermore, the transitions between bands 2 and 3 can be\nexplained as being due to a crossing of the bands at \u2248700 keV\nexcitation energy, characterized by chance near degeneracies\nand wave function mixings, as discussed in more detail in\nSec. IV. The crossing requires equal spin and parity values\nfor the 696 and 716 keV levels in the respective bands, and\nI\u03c0 = 11+ is therefore specified for these two levels to give\nconsistency with the band 3 assignment already discussed.\n054306-10\nHIGH-K STATES IN THE ODD-ODD NUCLIDE 180Re PHYSICAL REVIEW C 72, 054306 (2005)\n180Re\nco\nun\nts\nEnergy [keV]\nelectrons (1.2-4.3 Amps)\n200 300 400 500 600 700\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\nx2\n237\n238\n246\n255\n261\/264\n276\n286\n311\n329\n367\n417\n457\n457\n474\n494\n507 550\n584\n600 678\n0\n4000\n8000\nx2\n   Ta\n -rays\u03b3\n177\n   Re181\n20\n8\/\n20\n9\n21\n8\n22\n4\n23\n7\/\n23\n8\n24\n6\n25\n5 26\n1\/\n26\n4\n27\n6 28\n6\n29\n2 30\n1\n30\n7\n31\n1\n31\n8 32\n9\n34\n2\n35\n3(\n?)\n36\n7\n37\n4\n39\n9(\n?)\n40\n6(\n?) 4\n13 41\n7\n44\n7 4\n53\n45\n7(\n18\n0R\ne\/\n )\n46\n1 47\n4\n49\n4 50\n7 51\n1\n55\n0\n58\n4\n60\n0\n60\n8(\n?)\n61\n8 67\n8\n73\n6(\n?)\nFIG. 3. Spectra for \u03b3 rays (top) and electrons (bottom) from the wide sweep of the magnetic field. The electron spectrum has been shifted so\nthat the K-shell transitions in rhenium align with the corresponding \u03b3 -ray transitions. Labeled transitions are assigned to 180Re unless indicated\notherwise.\nBand 2 forms two separate signatures (E2 sequences) above\nspin 10+, in the sense that the \u0005I = 1 transitions are of too\nlow intensity to be observed. In band 3 on the other hand, the\nmixed dipole-quadrupole transitions are more intense relative\nto the stretched E2 transitions. Several additional transitions\nhave been observed in these bands, compared to previous work\n[10,11].\nBand 3 is assigned the K\u03c0 = 7+, \u03bd9\/2+[624] \u2297\n\u03c05\/2+[402] configuration in accord with Ref. [10]. The\nconfiguration for band 2 is suggested to be \u03bd7\/2\u2212[514] \u2297\n\u03c01\/2\u2212[541] with a K value (4+), which is less than the\nbandhead spin (5+) on account of the aligned 1\/2\u2212[541] proton\nthat is involved. The initial alignment value of 4h\u00af (see Fig. 4)\nsupports the presence of this orbital.\nIn Ref. [12], bands 2 and 3 were assigned different\nconfigurations, with K\u03c0 = 3+ and K\u03c0 = 4+, respectively, but\nthis was largely due to incomplete experimental information.\nIt is further noted that for band 2 there is a corresponding\nstructure in 178Ta, which was assigned K\u03c0 = 4+ [20], with\n|gK \u2212 gR| = 0.18 \u00b1 0.02. This compares well with the 180Re\nvalue of 0.14 \u00b1 0.02.\nThe lowest level identified in band 2 forms the effective\nground state of the high-spin part of the 180Re level structure,\nas elaborated in the present work. There is no connection\nfound with the level structure determined from \u03b2 decay [6\u20139].\nFurthermore, the assigned 5+ member of the band is not\nnecessarily the bandhead, as there could be an additional\ntransition from the 5+ state with a low energy (\u223c30 keV)\nto which the present experiment is insensitive. Nevertheless,\nthis would have no direct impact on the other spin, parity, and\nconfiguration assignments discussed in this work, which use\nbands 4 and 11 as their basis.\n4. Band 1, K\u03c0 = (5\u2212), based on the 178 keV level\nTwo linked sequences of \u03b3 -ray transitions, corresponding\nto the present band 1, were previously identified [11] up to\nthe 582 keV (16 \u2192 14) and 748 keV (21 \u2192 19) transitions.\nThe bandhead deexcitation, however, was not established. In\nRef. [11], this band was assigned to 180Re on the basis that it\ncould not be associated with either of the neighboring isotopes\n181Re [24] and 179Re [25], although the strongest transitions\nfrom this band were unresolved from \u03b3 rays emitted from\nboth isotopes. In the present work, band 1 is confirmed as\nbelonging to 180Re on the basis of coincidences observed with\nthe 45.8 keV transition in band 2, and the lowest member\nof band 1 decays to band 2 through a tentatively identified\n132.0 keV transition. This transition was observed in prompt\ncoincidence with the strong transitions in band 1, see Fig. 7.\nHowever, with five transitions assigned to 180Re in the energy\nrange 132.0\u2013134.5 (see Table I), a firm placement of the\n132.0 keV transition has not been possible. (Figure 7 also\nshows the presence of a 324.1 keV transition which was\nreported in Ref. [11] and is still unplaced in the present level\nscheme.)\nIt remains problematical to determine the spin for the lowest\nlevel, at 178 keV, identified in band 1, because it might not\nbe the bandhead; i.e., there could be additional unobserved\n054306-11\nH.

This could be made consistent with the present work by\nthe insertion of a low-energy (unobserved) in-band transition\nat the bottom of the band, which would require the whole band\nto be shifted up by that transition energy.\nBand 1 in Ref. [11] was given a \u03bdi 13\n2\n\u2297 \u03c0h 9\n2\nassignment, i.e.,\n\u03bd9\/2+[624] \u2297 \u03c01\/2\u2212[541]. These two nucleons can couple\nto K\u03c0 = 4\u2212 or 5\u2212, the former being energetically favored by\nthe Gallagher-Moszkowski rules [27], although both nucleons\nare strongly affected by Coriolis mixing. Figure 4 shows that\nthe alignment of this band is the largest of the two-quasiparticle\nbands in 180Re, about 5h\u00af at h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.1 MeV. Because of\nthe strong Coriolis mixing, the K value is not well defined.\nHowever, the label K\u03c0 = (5\u2212) is adopted since the simple\ng-factor analysis favors this value (see Table III). The K value\nis less than the apparent bandhead spin of 7\u2212, a feature that\nmay be associated in particular with the h 9\n2\n, 1\/2\u2212[541] proton,\nas with band 2.\nB. Four-quasiparticle bands\nFour rotational bands (numbers 5, 6, 7, and 8) built on\nfour-quasiparticle intrinsic states have been observed in 180Re.\nThese bands were also reported in Ref. [11], but, with the\nexception of band 8, they were not extended to high spin,\nand there are differences in the bandhead decays. Due also\nto the reassignments of bands 4 and 11 (discussed above)\nnew spin, parity, and configuration assignments for the four-\nquasiparticle bands are proposed in the present work. The four\nbands decay mainly via the 13+ isomeric level at 1566 keV, the\nbandhead of band 5, into both bands 4 and 11. In optimizing\nthe statistical accuracy for the 13+ bandhead lifetime, double\nenergy gates were set (see Fig. 8) on \u03b3 -ray transitions below\nthe 13+ bandhead and above the 16+, 1876 keV bandhead. It\nwas found that, in addition to the 107 \u00b1 2 ns mean-life for the\n13+ bandhead (see next section) it was necessary to include an\nadditional component with a mean life of 7 \u00b1 1 ns. However,\nit was not possible to determine to which one or more of the\nthree intermediate bandheads (14\u2212, 15\u2212, or 16+) this should\nbe ascribed. Accordingly, we consider that each intermediate\nbandhead has \u03c4 < 8 ns.\n1. Band 5, K\u03c0 = 13+, based on the 1566 keV level\nBand 5 has an isomeric bandhead with a mean life of\n107 \u00b1 2 ns (see Fig. 8). The isomer was previously identified\nin Refs. [10,11], with consistent lifetimes, though the present\nmeasurement has a smaller uncertainty. The multipolarities of\nsome of the isomeric transitions are listed in Table II. The\nconversion coefficient of the 678.1 keV transition is measured\nto be \u03b1K = 0.008(1), which establishes its E2 character and\nleads to the I\u03c0 =K\u03c0 = 13+ assignment for the isomer. At\nleast four quasiparticles are needed to provide such a high K\nvalue, and the excitation energy of 1566 keV is consistent\nwith the energy required to break one additional nucleon\npair relative to the two-quasiparticle states. The associated\nrotational sequence (band 5) is very weakly populated and is\ntentatively placed in the level scheme (Fig. 2).\nBand 5 is suggested to have the configuration \u03bd7\/2\u2212[514],\n9\/2+[624], 5\/2\u2212[512] \u2297 \u03c05\/2+[402].

It is now established\nthat band 7 is associated with the 54.8 keV transition (see\nFig. 9). It was not possible to establish a lifetime associated\nspecifically with the 54.8 keV transition, but an upper limit of\n\u03c4 < 8 ns can be set. The isomeric nature previously attributed\nto the corresponding level in Ref. [11] is understood to be\ndue to a higher-lying long-lived isomer (see later for more\ndetails). From intensity balancing, the 54.8 keV transition\nhas \u03b1TOT = 7 \u00b1 2, which strongly suggests M1 (\u03b1TOT = 5.4)\nrather than E2 (\u03b1TOT = 59.4) or E1 (\u03b1TOT = 0.38) character,\nthereby establishing a bandhead spin of 15\u2212.\nThe proposed configuration is \u03bd7\/2\u2212[514], 9\/2+[624],\n5\/2\u2212[512] \u2297 \u03c09\/2\u2212[514].

In this case, the relatively small\nalignment of ix = 4h\u00af at h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.15 MeV favors the former\nconfiguration, involving a single i 13\n2\nneutron. The relatively low\nalignment is consistent also with the weak population of the\nband. A comparable K\u03c0 = 15\u2212 band has also been observed in\n178Ta [20] with a similar |gK \u2212 gR| = 0.16 \u00b1 0.02 (compared\nwith 0.18 \u00b1 0.09 for 180Re). A different configuration mixing\nwas discussed in that case, though with the same dominant\nstructure.\nIt is also notable that band 7 is crossed by band 6, and\nthe unfavored members of band 7 are not identified above\nthe crossing. Further discussion of the crossing is given in\nSec. IV. This interpretation provides additional evidence in\nsupport of the proposed level structure and the relative spin\nand parity assignments. Indeed, in our preliminary report\n[13] bands 6 and 7 were swapped (relative to what is now\npresented), but the identification of the 319 keV \u03b3 ray as an\ninterband transition now removes the ambiguity.\n4.

This is the\nso-called t-band structure [19,29,30], which was first identified\nin 179W [19], an isotone of 180Re. While in 179W the three-\nquasiparticle t band crosses its respective one-quasiparticle\ng band, in 180Re the four-quasiparticle, K\u03c0 = 16+ t band is\nalready energetically favored compared to its corresponding\ntwo-quasiparticle, K\u03c0 = 8+ \u201cg band,\u201d so that no crossing can\ntake place. In principle, given sufficient interaction between\nthese two bands, a 164 keV E2 transition might be observable\nfrom the K\u03c0 = 16+ bandhead to the 14+ member of the\nK\u03c0 = 8+ band, but this has not been identified in the present\nwork. A remarkably similar situation exists in 178Ta [20],\nwhere the corresponding E2 interband transition would have\nan energy of 190 keV.\nThe energy differences between the t and g bands in the\nN = 105 isotones 178Ta and 180Re, compared to 179W, can\nbe understood to arise from two factors. First, because of\nthe higher spins in the odd-odd isotones from the additional\nquasiparticle, the rotational energies are greater, favoring the\n\u0005K \u2248 8, t band excitation. Second, the residual interactions\nwith the odd proton give additional favoring to the t-band\nconfiguration. Hence, it may be concluded, the g-t band\ncrossing observed in 179W is absent in 178Ta and 180Re, because\nthe respective t bands are already energetically favored at their\nbandheads.\nC. Six-quasiparticle bands\nTwo new bands, numbers 9 and 10, are assigned to 180Re.\nThese are associated with a high-lying isomer for which initial\nevidence was reported in Ref. [11]. A mean life of 13 \u00b1 1 \u00b5s\nhas now been measured, as illustrated in Fig. 10. The principal\ndecay path of the isomer is by a 456.8 keV transition (see\nFig. 9) to band 8. The isomer decays through two other routes.\nOne is to a state at 3408.4 keV via an unobserved 62.9 keV\ntransition. (This transition could not be separated from the\nintense 61.1 keV K\u03b11 x rays of 180Re.) The other decay route\nis via a 102.2 keV transition, illustrated in Fig. 11, to a state at\n3369.1 keV which decays in turn via an 1164.1 keV transition\nto the I\u03c0 = 17\u2212 member of band 11.\n1. Band 9, K\u03c0 = 21\u2212, based on the 3471 keV level\nBand 9 is built on the 13 \u00b5s isomeric state and decays to\nthe 20+ state of band 8 via a 456.8 keV transition (see Fig. 9)\nwhich is found to be of E1 character from its directly measured\nconversion coefficient of \u03b1K = 0.0084 \u00b1 0.0010.

Electron spectrum for the narrow-sweep magnetic-field\nmeasurement showing fits of the 457 keV line in both 180Re and 177Ta.\n177Ta [28], which was significantly populated, has a 456.7 keV\ntransition below an isomeric level of comparable mean life\n(8.6 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5s) to that of the 456.8 keV transition in 180Re.\nHowever, the K binding energy differences result in conversion\nlines which are partially resolved, hence component electron\nintensities can be obtained, see Fig. 12. The corresponding\n\u03b3 -ray intensities can be determined with the aid of \u03b3 -\u03b3\ncoincidences. With implied E1 character for the 456.8 keV\ntransition, the bandhead of band 9 is assigned I\u03c0 = K\u03c0 =\n21\u2212.\nMultiquasiparticle calculations (see Sec. IV) indicate that\ntwo competing configurations, with the required spin and\nparity, could be assigned to the 21\u2212 state at 3471 keV:\n(i) \u03bd 9\/2+[624] \u2297 \u03c05\/2+[402], 9\/2\u2212[514], 7\/2+[404],\n1\/2\u2212 [541], 11\/2\u2212[505]; and\n(ii) \u03bd 7\/2\u2212[514], 9\/2+[624], 5\/2\u2212[512] \u2297 \u03c0 5\/2+[402],\n9\/2\u2212[514], 7\/2+[404].\nThe second of these involves only one aligning quasiparticle\nand is favored by the relatively low alignment of the band, ix =\n5h\u00af at h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.15 MeV, as seen in Fig. 4. The weak population\nof the band is also consistent with its low alignment.\n2. Band 10, K\u03c0 = (22+), based on the 3895 keV level\nBand 10 feeds into the 13 \u00b1 1 \u00b5s isomer via a 424.0 keV\ntransition (see Fig. 13). In the absence of a significant\nlifetime, the 424 keV transition is tentatively assigned a dipole\ncharacter, and the bandhead of band 10 is assigned I = (22).\nConsequently, there is a crossing between bands 9 and 10\nat I = 25, with close-lying states of equal spin. The lack of\ninterband transitions or significantly perturbed energy levels\nsuggests that the two bands have opposite parities, hence band\n10 is tentatively assigned positive parity.\nMultiquasiparticle calculations predict a low-lying 22+\nstate with the configuration \u03bd7\/2\u2212[514], 7\/2+[633], 9\/2+\n[624] \u2297 \u03c05\/2+[402], 9\/2\u2212[514], 7\/2+[404]. The involve-\nment of two i 13\n2\nneutrons gives extra alignment compared\nto band 9 and is consistent with the observed value of ix = 6h\u00af\nat h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.15 MeV (see Fig. 4). This leads to the crossing\nwith band 9, despite band 10 being unfavored at its bandhead,\nand it furthermore explains the relatively strong population of\nband 10. Indeed, band 10 extends to the highest spin, I = (29),\nidentified in 180Re.\nA similar band has been found in 178Ta [20] with the same\nconfiguration assignment. As with the other corresponding\nbands in these two isotones, the alignment in the 180Re band is\nabout 2h\u00af higher than in the 178Ta band. However, the g factors\nseem to differ significantly. The 178Ta band has |gK \u2212 gR| =\n0.25 \u00b1 0.04, compared to 0.12 \u00b1 0.06 for the 180Re band. The\nlatter value has a large percentage uncertainty arising from the\nband\u2019s weak population, and improved accuracy would clearly\nbe needed for a more discriminating comparison.\nD. Other states\nThe ability to measure \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidences in between beam\npulses gives great sensitivity to transitions that follow isomeric\ndecays. Combined with the high spin, I = 21, of the six-\nquasiparticle isomer in 180Re, the method enables several\nnon-yrast high-spin states to be identified, as illustrated in\nFig. 2.

The spins and parities\nof the various states are determined through their connections\nto the bands already discussed, by intensity flow considera-\ntions with corresponding conversion-coefficient constraints,\nand by directly measured conversion coefficients.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe level scheme for 180Re is discussed in a selective way\nin the following sections. After an analysis of the low-spin\nband crossing, bandhead excitation energies are compared with\nmultiquasiparticle calculations, and finally the hindrances of\nthe K-forbidden decays are examined.\nA. Band crossings\nIt has been established that there are several \u03b3 -ray tran-\nsitions between bands 2 and 3, indicating an interaction\nbetween the two bands. Figure 14 depicts the crossing in a\nplot of excitation energy versus spin, including also the other\ntwo-quasiparticle bands. The interaction matrix element V is\nevaluated with the usual two-band-mixing approach (see, for\nexample, Ref. [21]) making use of the in-band\/out-of-band\nB(E2) ratios. The intrinsic (unperturbed) transition matrix\nelements are taken from the rotational model. The interaction\nhas been calculated for two cases, see Table IV, first with\nequal K for both bands, and second with different K values. It\nis clear that the different-K assumption gives better consistency\nfor the calculated interaction strengths, with an average value\nof V = 7.3 \u00b1 0.4 keV. This is in accord with the assigned\nK values discussed earlier. Figure 15 illustrates the level\nTABLE IV.

This representation is\nsensitive, in the form of odd-even staggering, to interactions\nbetween bands. It is seen that a constant interaction matrix\nelement of V = 7.3 keV produces smooth curves for the\nunperturbed bands in the I = 11 crossing region. This analysis\nthus provides a good description of the crossing between\nbands 2 and 3, including the interband transition strengths,\nand gives support to the validity of the relative spin and parity\nassignments.\nThere is another band crossing. Band 6 crosses band 7,\nbut the continuation of band 7 is not observed. Mixing is\nindicated by the presence of the 319.2 keV transition from\nthe I\u03c0 = 19\u2212 member of band 6 to the I\u03c0 = 18\u2212 member of\nband 7 (see Fig. 2).

However, the weak population of bands\n6 and 7, and the nonobservation of the unfavored states above\nthe crossing, make the mixing strength difficult to quantify.\nB. Nilsson-plus-BCS calculations\nThe proposed quasiparticle configurations for the bands\nin 180Re have been calculated using two separate methods.\nThe first method, discussed in this section, is that of Jain\net al. [31], based on the Nilsson model and BCS pairing\nwith blocking by quasiparticle excitations. A full set of\nnear-yrast multiquasiparticle states was calculated. In this\nprocess, empirical single-particle energies were used for states\nclose to the Fermi surface, estimated from one-quasiparticle\nenergies, where available, in neighboring odd-mass nuclei\n(179Re, 181Re for protons, and 179W, 181Os for neutrons [32]).\nTo produce the correct average particle number, the Fermi\nlevel was recalculated for each configuration. The monopole\npairing force was G\u03bd = 21.5A = 0.119 MeV for neutrons and\nG\u03c0 = 22.5A = 0.125 MeV for protons, and the deformation\nparameters were \u000e2 = 0.232 and \u000e4 = 0.047 [33]. The proton\nand neutron levels were treated separately to create their\nmultiquasiparticle states, and then the two were combined.\nResidual interactions were also taken into account, using the\nempirical two-quasiparticle Gallagher-Moszkowski splittings\n[27,34] according to the method of Jain et al. [31]. The\nresultant multiquasiparticle energies can then be compared\nwith the experimental values.\nGenerally good agreement is found between theoretical\nand experimental two-, four- and six-quasiparticle energies\nas seen in Table V (compare the columns \u201cCalc.III\u201d and\n\u201cExpt.\u201d) with the notable exception of the K\u03c0 = 21\u2212 state.\nThe energy calculated for this level (residual interactions\nincluded) is higher than the experimental energy by 378 keV.\n(In the case of 178Ta, the corresponding calculated energy,\nwith Lipkin-Nogami pairing, was in good agreement [20].)\nThe discrepancy in 180Re may be partly due to the simple BCS\ntreatment of pairing and partly due to the fixed-deformation\nconstraint in the calculations. There is a significant discrepancy\n(>200 keV) also for the two-quasiparticle K\u03c0 = 5\u2212 bandhead.\nBoth of these cases are predicted (see next section) to have\nlarge quadrupole deformations. The K\u03c0 = 5\u2212 configuration\ncould be a special case because of large Coriolis mixing and\nthe proximity of the favored K\u03c0 = 4\u2212 coupling (see also\nSec. III). The configurations are summarized in Table III.\nA graphical comparison between calculated and experimen-\ntal energies is given in Fig. 17, including additional low-lying\nmultiquasiparticle states. The following observations can be\nmade:\n(i) Calculated K\u03c0 = 13\u2212 and 12\u2212 states have reasonable\ncorrespondence with the experimental states at 1670 and\n1403 keV, respectively (see Fig. 2).

This might possibly\ncorrespond to the higher-energy experimental level at\n3369 keV (see also next section).\nC. Potential energy surface calculations\nPotential energy surface (PES) calculations using the\nconfiguration-constrained method of Xu et al. [35] have\nbeen used as a second approach for understanding the\nmultiquasiparticle states. In this approach, the Woods-Saxon\npotential (with no adjustment of single-particle energies) and\nLipkin-Nogami pairing were used. For each quasiparticle\nconfiguration, the occupied orbitals were fixed and the\nquadrupole and hexadecapole deformations, \u03b22, \u03b3 , and \u03b24,\nwere varied in order to minimize the excitation energy. (Note\nthat \u000e2 \u2248 0.94\u03b22.) The neutron and proton monopole pairing\nstrengths were determined by the average gap method [36] with\na 10% enhancement [35]. Because of the additional complexity\nof this method, only selected 180Re multiquasiparticle states\nwere calculated, with results given in Tables III and V.\nThe calculated excitation energies agree satisfactorily with\nthe experimental results and are broadly consistent with\nthe Nilsson-plus-BCS calculations. The variable-shape PES\nmethod gives substantially better agreement for the experimen-\ntal K\u03c0 = 5\u2212 and 21\u2212 energies, with large calculated \u03b22 values.\nFurthermore, the K\u03c0 = 19\u2212 state that has a low energy of\n2704 keV from the Nilsson-plus-BCS calculations (discussed\nabove) has also been calculated with the PES method. It is\npredicted to lie at 3340 keV, which is close in energy to the\nobserved (19\u2212) level at 3369 keV.\nOverall, the combination of a more realistic potential, a\nbetter treatment of pairing, and variable shape, combine to\nmake the PES calculations more reliable than the Nilsson-\nplus-BCS calculations.\nD. K-forbidden transitions\nThe projection K of the total angular momentum on the\nsymmetry axis is approximately a good quantum number\nfor deformed axially symmetric nuclei. This defines the\nK-selection rule for electromagnetic transitions, \u0005K \u0002 l, for\nmultipolarity l. In practice, transitions which violate this\nselection rule are hindered rather than forbidden because of\nK-mixing mechanisms. A measure of the inhibition can be\nexpressed by the hindrance factor FW = \u03c4 \u03b3 \/\u03c4W , which is\nthe ratio of the partial \u03b3 -ray mean life to the Weisskopf\nsingle-particle estimate [37]. The hindrance per degree of\nK forbiddenness, also called the reduced hindrance, is f\u03bd =\nF\n1\/\u03bd\nW , where \u03bd = \u0005K \u2212 l is the degree of forbiddenness. In\nRefs. [37,38], it was found that f\u03bd \u2248 100 for a range of \u03bd and l,\nso that for each additional unit of \u0005K , transitions are hindered\nby an additional factor of about 100. This situation is well\nillustrated [39] by the decay of high-K isomers in 178Hf, which\nis arguably located at the center of the K-isomer region [2].\nHowever, many transitions have also been found in the same\nregion with f\u03bd \t 100 (see, for example, Refs. [19,40\u201345]),\ngiving valuable information about the way that K mixing takes\nplace. Since 180Re is on the high-Z side of this K-isomer region,\nthe reduced-hindrance values may shed further light on the\nK-mixing mechanisms.\nOne transition of particular note with regard to K-forbidden\ntransitions is the 1164 keV, (19\u2212) to 17\u2212 transition from\nthe 3369 keV level. Although of low intensity, it is well\nestablished, as demonstrated in Fig. 11. Considering, tenta-\ntively, the (19\u2212) level as an intrinsic state with K\u03c0 = 19\u2212, the\n1164 keV transition would have E2 character and change the\nK value by 10 units; i.e., it would be highly K forbidden,\nwith \u03bd = 8, bypassing the intermediate-K structures. Due to\nthe low population intensity and the feeding through the\n13 \u00b5s isomer, the lifetime of the 3369 keV level has a\nrelatively poor constraint of \u03c4 < 100 ns, obtained from the\nobserved coincidence between the 1164 keV transition and the\n102 keV feeding transition. Nevertheless, this limit indicates\na significantly small reduced-hindrance value, f\u03bd < 4.4. Such\na low value may be related to the location of the (19\u2212) level\nrelatively far from the yrast line, which is broadly consistent\nwith the systematic behavior discussed by Walker et al.

In previous\nwork, K-forbidden E2 and E3 reduced hindrances from four-\nand five-quasiparticle isomers have been compared, through\ntheir inverse correlation with excitation energy relative to a\nrigid rotor, indicating a level-density dependence in the degree\nof K mixing [2,46,49]. The data are shown in Fig. 18, with the\nodd-odd nuclides [20,50\u201352] specifically indicated. It has been\nsuggested [53] that the large reduced hindrance for 178Ta may\nbe related to neutron-proton configuration mixing. In any case,\nthe 180Re value is in relatively good agreement with the trend of\nthe other data. This supports the proposition that level density\nplays a critical role in K mixing, though the sizable scatter\nof the data also indicates the importance of other degrees of\nfreedom [2].\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\nI(I+1)\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\nEx\nci\nta\ntio\nn \nEn\ner\ngy\n (k\neV\n)\n21\n_\n13+\nFIG. 19.

Following from the above discussion,\nstates that lie well above the yrast line are expected to have\nmore K admixtures than the near-yrast states and hence lower\nf\u03bd values. In 180Re, both the K\u03c0 = 13+ and 21\u2212 isomers are\nnot too far from yrast and the f\u03bd values are substantial.\nNote that 180Re is the only odd-odd rhenium isotope\nknown to display K isomerism for a six-quasiparticle state.\nNeighboring 179Re has recently been found to contain a\nseven-quasiparticle isomer [4]. While this also decays by\ntransitions with substantial f\u03bd values, uncertainty in the isomer\nspin assignment makes the interpretation ambiguous in that\ncase.\nV. SUMMARY\nIn the present work, 11 rotational bands in 180Re have\nbeen observed and characterized by \u03b3 -ray and electron\nspectroscopy. The bands have been extended to higher spin\ncompared to that in previous studies. Among the two-\nquasiparticle bands, new connecting transitions have enabled\nsignificant improvements to be made in the organization of the\nlevel scheme, leading to revised spin and parity assignments,\nand hence to a revised interpretation. This builds on the\ntheoretical analysis of the two-quasiparticle bands by Jain\net al. [12].\nThe present work provides a new and detailed band-\ncrossing analysis of two-quasiparticle bands 2 and 3. The\nproperties of a four-quasiparticle t band are compared with\nrelated structures in the N = 105 isotones. Two bands are\nidentified above a six-quasiparticle, \u03c4 = 13 \u00b5s isomer. Con-\nfiguration assignments are given for all the bands, sup-\nported by multiquasiparticle calculations, alignments, and g\nfactors.\nThe four- and six-quasiparticle isomers in 180Re are found\nto decay by K-forbidden transitions. The substantial reduced-\nhindrance values, 17\u0002 f\u03bd \u0002 66, are most likely related to the\nnear-yrast location of the isomers.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the ANU technical staff for their excellent\nsupport.
