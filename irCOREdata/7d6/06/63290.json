Its molecular mechanism remains\nunknown. Recently, it has been shown that reciprocal expression of\nthyroid hormone-activating enzyme [type 2 deiodinase (Dio2)] and\n-inactivating enzyme [type 3 deiodinase (Dio3)] genes in the\nmediobasal hypothalamus is critical for photoperiodically induced\ngonadal growth. Since thyroid hormones are required not only for\nphotoinduction, but also for the induction of photorefractoriness,\nwe examined the expression of these genes in relation to photore-\nfractoriness in birds and mammals. Transfer of birds to long\nphotoperiods induced strong expression of Dio2. This was main-\ntained in tree sparrow when they later became photorefractory, but\ndecreased somewhat in quail. In hamsters, transfer to long photo-\nperiods also induced strong expression of Dio2. High values were\nnot maintained under long photoperiods, and, indeed, expression\ndecreased at the same rate as in animals transferred to short\nphotoperiods. There was no renewed expression of Dio2 associated\nwith testicular growth as animals became refractory to short\nphotoperiods. Expression of Dio3 was high under short photope-\nriods and low under long photoperiods in all the animals examined,\nexcept for the short photoperiod-refractory hamsters. Our present\nstudy revealed complex regulation of deiodinase genes in the\nphotoinduction and photorefractory processes in birds and mam-\nmals. These gene changes may be involved in the regulation of\nphotorefractoriness, as well as photoinduction.\nEurasian tree sparrow; Japanese quail; Djungarian hamster\nTHE MAJORITY OF BIRD AND MAMMAL species living outside the\ntropics uses a changing photoperiod to time their breeding\nseasons, but the photoreceptive and neuroendocrine mecha-\nnisms involved differ markedly between them (10, 15). Also,\nthe degree of gonadal regression outside the breeding season is\ngreater in birds, which may be an adaptation to flight, and the\nduration of breeding seasons of birds tend to be more restricted\nand asymmetrical than those of mammals. Although the times\nof gonadal maturation and regression are controlled by photo-\nperiod in both birds and mammals, the period of gonadal\nmaturation, the breeding season, is rarely symmetrical with the\nannual change in photoperiod. The asymmetry is caused by\nphotorefractoriness.\nPhotorefractoriness is the switch from an active to an inac-\ntive reproductive state, or vice versa, that occurs apparently\nspontaneously at some stage during prolonged exposure to a\nparticular photoperiod (19, 20). In the case of birds, transfer\nfrom a short to a long photoperiod initially induces gonadal\nmaturation, but some time later gonadal regression occurs as\nbirds become refractory to the long photoperiod (8, 10, 28).\nSome species, e.g., Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), do not\nshow spontaneous gonadal regression but become predisposed\nto undergo regression when the photoperiod is reduced some-\nwhat, but to a photoperiod still longer than earlier required to\ninduce maturation. This is relative, as opposed to absolute,\nphotorefractoriness (25). In the case of small mammals, such as\nhamsters, transfer from a short to a long photoperiod also\ninduces immediate gonadal maturation, and subsequent trans-\nfer to a short photoperiod induces immediate regression. Pho-\ntorefractoriness in mammals is the spontaneous renewed go-\nnadal maturation that occurs later during prolonged exposure to\na short photoperiod (18\u201320). Although the same term, pho-\ntorefractoriness, is used for both phenomena, the process in\nmammals may be opposite to that in birds. Refractoriness to\nshort photoperiods in mammals may be equivalent to the\ntermination of photorefractoriness to long photoperiods in\nbirds. Both occur during exposure to a short photoperiod and\ninvolve reactivation of the reproductive system. In birds this\nreactivation is characterized by renewed photosensitivity, but,\nunlike mammals, is not normally associated with spontaneous\nrapid gonadal maturation.\nRecently, it has been shown that local activation of thyroid\nhormone in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) is critical for\nlong photoperiod-induced testicular growth in Japanese quail\n(32, 35). Long photoperiods induce expression of type 2\ndeiodinase (Dio2) gene and reduce expression of type 3 deio-\ndinase (Dio3) gene. Dio2 is the thyroid hormone-activating\nenzyme; it converts the prohormone thyroxine (T4) into the\nbioactive form T3 by outer-ring deiodination. The inactivating\nenzyme (Dio3) converts both T4 and T3 into inactive metabo-\nlites reverse T3 and T2, respectively, by inner-ring deiodina-\ntion. It is well established that thyroid hormones are involved\nnot only in photoinduction, but also in photorefractoriness (5,\n10). Removal of the thyroid gland blocks photorefractoriness\n* T.

In the\npresent study, therefore, we examined expression of Dio2 and\nDio3 in relation to photorefractoriness in Eurasian tree spar-\nrows (Passer montanus), which show absolute photorefracto-\nriness, and Japanese quail, which show relative photorefracto-\nriness.\nAs is the case in birds, thyroid hormones are involved in the\nregulation of seasonal reproduction in mammals. Thyroidec-\ntomy blocks transition of seasonal reproduction in sheep (19,\n20), and photoperiodic regulation of Dio2 is observed in the\nDjungarian hamster (Phodopus sungorus) and goat (Capra\nhircus) (26, 31). Moreover, in hamsters, Dio2 expression is\nsuppressed by melatonin administration (26), and exogenous\nthyroid hormone administration elicits a long photoperiod\nresponse under short photoperiods (13). Although cDNA mi-\ncroarray analysis identified a class of genes encoding thyrox-\nine-binding proteins whose expression is associated with\nrefractoriness (21), a molecular mechanism for mammalian\nrefractoriness remains elusive. Therefore, we examined ex-\npression of Dio2 and Dio3 in the hypothalamus of photo-\nstimulated and photorefractory hamsters.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAnimals and housing. Male tree sparrows were caught from the\nwild in Nagoya during August 2003. They were kept under 8 h light:\n16 h dark (8L16D) condition for 3 mo at 24\u0001 1\u00b0C in light-tight boxes\n(55 \u0002 210 \u0002 62 cm). Male 4-wk-old Japanese quail were obtained\nfrom a local dealer and kept in the same conditions until 8 wk old.\nDjungarian hamsters were kept in our colony under 14L10D condi-\ntions until weaning at 3 wk old and then transferred into light-tight\nboxes. In the light-tight boxes, light was supplied by fluorescent lamps\nwith a light intensity of 200 lux measured at the level of the animal\u2019s\nhead. Food and water were provided ad libitum for all animals, and\nsunflower seeds were given once per week to hamsters. Animals were\ntreated in accordance with the guidelines of Nagoya University.\nLight schedules. Sparrows and quail were transferred from short\nphotoperiods (8L16D) to long photoperiods (18L6D). Brains were\ncollected before transfer (0 wk; photosensitive), 6 wk after transfer\n(photostimulated), and 20 wk after transfer (absolutely photorefrac-\ntory in sparrows, relative photorefractory in quail). In each case, this\nwas done at the midpoint of the light phase.\nTo examine the effects of long photoperiods, hamsters were moved\nto 8L16D after weaning to induce testicular regression as previously\ndescribed (26). One group of animals was continuously kept under\n8L16D, and another group was transferred to 14L10D at 7 wk of age.\nBrains were collected at 9 wk of age. To examine gene expression in\nrefractory animals, hamsters were kept under 14L10D after weaning.\nWhen 7 wk old, animals for the refractory group were transferred to\n10L14D, and control animals were kept under 14L10D. Brains were\ncollected (at the midpoint of the light phase) before transfer to\n10L14D (0 wk; photostimulated), 6 wk after transfer (gonadal re-\ngressed), and 27 wk after transfer (refractory).\nIn situ hybridization. In situ hybridization was carried out accord-\ning to previous work (34). Antisense 45-oligomer oligonucleotide\nprobes were labeled with [33P]deoxy-ATP (NEN Life Sciences, Bos-\nton, MA) using terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (Invitrogen\nLife Technologies): sparrow and quail Dio2, 5\u0003-gatggttcagcctcaat-\ngaatatcaagacggaaatacattctgta-3\u0003; sparrow Dio3, 5\u0003-ggatgatgtagagc-\nctctcgaagtaggcaccgtaggcggcgctgg-3\u0003; quail Dio3, 5\u0003-tctcctcctggat-\ngacgtagagccgctcgaagtaggcgccgtagg-3\u0003; hamster Dio2, 5\u0003-tgcttgagta-\ngaatgaccgagtcatagagcgccaggaagaggcag-3\u0003; and hamster Dio3, 5\u0003-\nctggtaaccgtcggggccacggcctccctggtacatgatggtgcc-3\u0003. Coronal sections\n(20 \u0004m thick) were prepared using a Cryostat (model CM3050S;\nLeica, Nussloch, Germany). Hybridization was carried out overnight\nat 42\u00b0C. After the glass slides were washed, they were air-dried and\napposed to Biomax-XR film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 2\nwk with 14C-labeled standards (American Radiolabeled Chemicals,\nSt. Louis, MO). Relative optical densities were measured using a\ncomputerized image analysis system (MCID Imaging Research, St.\nCatharines, Canada) and were converted into relative radioactive\nvalues (nanocuries) using 14C-labeled standards. Specific hybridiza-\ntion signals were obtained by subtracting background values obtained\nfrom adjacent brain areas that did not exhibit a hybridization signal.\nRESULTS\nExpression of Dio2 and Dio3 in photorefractory birds. In\nsparrows, there was significant testicular growth 6 wk after\ntransfer to long photoperiods, followed by complete regression\nafter 20 wk, as birds became absolutely photorefractory [one-\nway ANOVA, F(2,9) \u0005 44.6, P \u0006 0.0001, Fisher\u2019s least\nsignificant difference (LSD) post hoc test, P \u0006 0.0001, n \u0005\n4](Fig. 1A). In contrast, in relative photorefractory quail, the\nincrease in testis size after 6 wk of photostimulation was\nmaintained at 20 wk, as expected [one-way ANOVA,\nF(2,11)\u0005138.3, P \u0006 0.0001; Fisher\u2019s LSD post hoc test, P \u0006\n0.0001, n \u0005 4\u20135](Fig. 1B).\nExpression of Dio2 and Dio3 was observed in the basal\ntuberal hypothalamus, consisting of the infundibular nucleus\nand the median eminence in both sparrow and quail (Fig. 2, A\nand B). This is consistent with previous reports. In sparrows,\nexpression of Dio2 was significantly increased 6 wk after\ntransfer to long photoperiods, and this high expression was\nmaintained at 20 wk [one-way ANOVA, F(2,10) \u0005 20.6, P \u0006\n0.0005; by Fisher\u2019s LSD post hoc test, P \u0006 0.001, n \u0005 4 or 5]\n(Fig. 2A). In quail, expression of Dio2 was also significantly\nincreased 6 wk after transfer to long photoperiods, but expres-\nsion was somewhat attenuated at 20 wk [one-way ANOVA,\nF(2,11) \u0005 63.5, P \u0006 0.0001; Fisher\u2019s LSD post hoc test, P \u0006\n0.005, n \u0005 4\u20135] (Fig. 2B). These experiments were repeated\nusing different series of animals with consistent results (data\nnot shown). In contrast to Dio2, expression of Dio3 was high\nunder short photoperiods (0 wk) but almost undetectable 6 wk\nand 20 wk after transfer to long photoperiods in both sparrow\nand quail [sparrow: one-way ANOVA, F(2,10) \u0005 41.8, P \u0006\n0.0001, Fisher\u2019s LSD post hoc test, P \u0006 0.0001, n \u0005 4\u20135;\nFig. 1.

Strong ex-\npression of Dio3 was observed in hamsters shortly after trans-\nfer to short photoperiods, but this was not maintained; there\nwas no expression of Dio3 in hamsters as they became refrac-\ntory to short photoperiods [(two-way ANOVA for the compar-\nison between LD3SD and LD3LD), F(2,26) \u0005 156.0, P \u0006\n0.0001; Mann-Whitney U-test, 6 wk: P \u0006 0.01 (asterisk); 27\nwk: P \u0007 0.8; one-way ANOVA for the comparison among the\nSD group, F(2,14) \u0005 63.9, P \u0006 0.0001; Fisher\u2019s LSD post hoc\ntest, P \u0006 0.05, n \u0005 5\u20137] (Fig. 4B).\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study, we examined expression of Dio2 and\nDio3 in absolutely photorefractory Eurasian tree sparrows and\nin relative photorefractory Japanese quail. In these species,\nexpression of Dio2 and Dio3 was directly related to photope-\nriod (i.e., high expression of Dio3 and low expression of Dio2\nunder short photoperiods and high expression of Dio2 and low\nexpression of Dio3 under long photoperiods), but did not relate\nto gonadal status. Differences in reproductive state depend on\nthe amplitude and frequency of pulsatile secretion of gonado-\ntropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Unlike mammals, there is a\nprofound physiological switch-off of the GnRH system in\nseasonally breeding birds (10), including sparrows (6). In\nabsolutely photorefractory birds, a dramatic decline in hypo-\nthalamic GnRH content is observed by radioimmunoassay and\nimmunocytochemistry, suggesting that the GnRH system is\nregulated at the level of synthesis, as well as secretion (3, 10,\n22). In contrast to species that become absolute photorefrac-\ntory, relative photorefractory quail show no decline in hypo-\nthalamic GnRH (12). This suggests a fundamental difference\nbetween the mechanisms underlying the two forms of photore-\nfractoriness (10).\nThyroid hormones are involved in both photoinduction and\nphotorefractoriness. In the previous study, we observed sea-\nsonal morphological changes in the neuro-glial interaction\nbetween GnRH nerve terminals and glial endfeet in the median\neminence of Japanese quail (29). Since these morphological\nchanges were also caused by T3 administration, long-photope-\nFig. 2.

Starlings and\nsparrows become photoperiodically blind following thyroidec-\ntomy (5, 6). In these species, prevention of photorefractoriness\nby thyroidectomy is associated with maintenance of high\nhypothalamic GnRH levels typical of photosensitive birds (6,\n7, 22) and thyroidectomy of photorefractory birds results in an\nincrease in GnRH (9). These reports suggest that thyroid\nhormones are required to reduce GnRH synthesis during the\nphotorefractory state, rather than a decrease in secretion. The\nmaintenance of high expression of Dio2 and low expression of\nDio3 as tree sparrows became photorefractory in the present\nstudy supports the idea that photorefractoriness is not due to an\ninhibition of GnRH secretion, i.e., a reversal of what happens\nduring photostimulation. Rather, T3 may be involved in the\nlong-photoperiod process leading to decreased GnRH synthe-\nsis. However, quail also maintained high expression of Dio2,\nalthough somewhat less than during photostimulation, as they\nbecame relatively photorefractory. Yet this is not associated\nwith a decrease in hypothalamic stores of GnRH.\nIn short-day breeders, such as sheep and goats, thyroid\nhormones are required for the transition from estrus to anestrus\nin the spring. In the previous study, we found high expression\nof Dio2 in the hypothalamus of goats during this transition\nstage (31). As possible homologies between photorefractori-\nness in long-day birds and short-day mammals have been\npointed out (19, 20), the present results also appear to suggest\nthat the mechanism regulating short-day breeders and long-day\nbreeders may not be so radically different as previously\nthought.\nIn the present study, we have also examined expression of\nDio2 and Dio3 in Djungarian hamsters. Consistent with our\nprevious report (26), we observed significant induction of Dio2\nexpression when transferred from short to long photoperiods.\nHowever, expression of Dio2 decreased when hamsters were\ncontinuously kept under long photoperiods. Barrett et al. (1)\nhave reported that they failed to detect photoperiodic change of\nDio2 expression in their Siberian hamster. In the present study,\nwe did not find statistically significant difference in Dio2\nexpression between short and long photoperiod hamsters when\nwe transferred animals from long to short photoperiods. This\nmay explain the discrepancy between the results of our previ-\nous study and that of Barrett et al., because they examined\nexpression of Dio2 in animals transferred from long to short\nphotoperiods. Recently, Revel et al. (24) reported photoperi-\nodic regulation of Dio2 in Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus au-\nratus). In contrast to Djungarian hamsters, Dio2 expression\nremained elevated in the long photoperiod for at least 28 wk in\nthe Syrian hamsters. Although these two hamsters are known\nto be good photoperiodic models, differences in photoperiodic\nresponses are reported (4, 14, 17, 33). Although both species\nexhibit gonadal regression when exposed to short photoperi-\nods, they show opposite body weight changes (i.e., Djungarian\nhamsters lose weight, but Syrian hamsters gain weight follow-\ning short photoperiod exposure) (2). In addition, puberty is\napparently unaffected by the photoperiod in Syrian hamsters\n(4, 14), while it is highly affected by photoperiod in Djungarian\nhamsters (17, 33). Differences in Dio2 expression profiles may\ncontribute to the different photoperiodic responses between the\ntwo hamsters.\nIn contrast to Dio2, marked increase in Dio3 expression was\nobserved in short photoperiod hamsters. Since Dio3 metabo-\nlizes both prohormone T4 and bioactive T3, Dio3 may contrib-\nute to testicular regression when hamsters are transferred from\nlong to short photoperiods. In short-day refractory hamsters,\nexpression of Dio2 and Dio3 was undetectable. Consistent with\nthe present results, a low level of Dio2 expression is reported\nin the short-day refractory Syrian hamster (24). It is of note that\nthe expressions of a class of genes encoding thyroxine-binding\nproteins (TBPs; transthyretin, T4-binding globulin, and albu-\nmin) are downregulated and that T4 uptake was diminished in\nthe hypothalamus of refractory Siberian hamsters (21). Al-\nthough the molecular mechanism regulating refractoriness to\nshort photoperiods in hamsters remains unknown, lack of\nexpression of thyroid hormone-activating and -inactivating\nenzyme genes and TBPs may suggest that refractoriness to\nshort photoperiods in hamsters is not thyroid dependent.\nIt has been known for several decades that thyroid hormones\nare involved in regulation of photorefractoriness (6, 11, 16, 23,\n27). Our present study revealed complex regulation of deiodi-\nnase genes in the photoinduction and photorefractory processes\nin birds and mammals. This is a first step toward understanding\nFig. 4.
