(2003).\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe UK\u2019s productivity performance figures high on\nthe government\u2019s agenda. For three and a half\ndecades after the Second World War, the country\u2019s\nproductivity growth lagged that of most of its major\ncompetitors, with the signal exception being the\nUSA. Since the early 1980s there has been some\ncatch up, but the UK\u2019s levels of productivity per\nhour remain lower than those of France, Germany,\nand, of course, the USA. However, at a more\ndisaggregated level there are some interesting dif-\nferences in sectoral trends. Throughout the 1990s\nthe UK closed the gap in some sectors\u2014most\nnotably in networked industries (electricity, gas, and\nwater), manufacturing, and business services. At\nthe same time it fell further behind in other sectors\u2014\nincluding wholesaling and retailing, financial inter-\nmediation, and machinery and equipment.2 The\ngovernment is concerned about this for a number of\n446\nOXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY, VOL. 22, NO. 4\nreasons, including what it might indicate about the\nUK\u2019s productive efficiency and what it might imply\nfor international competitiveness and for standards\nof living. The puzzle is that the aggregate hourly\nproductivity gap remains hard to close, despite\npolicy interventions on many fronts.\nThere is a large body of literature3 which attempts\nto account for the UK\u2019s historical productivity\nfailings. This issue of the Oxford Review of Eco-\nnomic Policy is mainly concerned with recent and\nongoing research on some of the factors which\ncurrent official thinking appears to believe will make\na significant difference\u2014education and training,\nmanagement skills and practices, innovation, and\ninvestment. Thus the emphasis of most of the\ncontributions is on the labour market and the\nworkplace and on getting inside the black box of the\norganization. They represent some of the work\nbeing done by members of an ESRC research\nprogramme (AIM)4 and an ESRC research centre\n(SKOPE).5\nThis introductory article attempts to put these con-\ntributions into context and to show where they fit\ninto the broader policy debate. Section II briefly\ndiscusses measurement issues and recent produc-\ntivity performance. Section III introduces the gov-\nernment\u2019s five levers of productivity growth, linking\nthem to a more traditional typology of the sources of\nproductivity growth, emphasizing in particular the\nimportance of distinguishing between the short run\nand the long run. It points out some possible lacunae\nin current policy thinking. Section IV concentrates\non a specific contribution of many of the articles in\nthis issue. This is to emphasize what is actually going\non within the organization and specifically to use\nnewly generated data sets to satisfy the need for\nresearchers to delve into the internal workings of the\norganization in order to understand the true effects\nof pulling on the government\u2019s policy levers. Section\nV presents some implications for research and for\npolicy, exploring the question of whether it is appro-\npriate to think of UK policy.\nII. DIFFERENT WAYS OF\nMEASURING PRODUCTIVITY AND\nUK PERFORMANCE\nConventionally, researchers employ two metrics of\nproductivity\u2014labour productivity and total factor\nproductivity. In this article we concentrate on the\nformer. Three, rather different, measures of labour\nproductivity are deployed at the aggregate level:\noutput per capita, output per person employed, and\noutput per employed hour. The UK relative position\nis different depending on the measure used. It is\nbehind the USA on all three. It is ahead of France\nand Germany on output per capita. It is ahead of\nGermany but behind France on output per person\nemployed, and behind France and Germany on\noutput per employed hour. These differences can be\nexplained by differences between countries in em-\nployment rates and hours worked per annum. The\nUK\u2019s employment rates are higher than those of\nFrance and Germany, as are its annual hours of\nwork. Thus a relatively poor performance on output\nper hour is, at least partially, compensated for by\nthese other two factors. In this context the govern-\nment takes some justifiable pleasure in the fact that\nthe UK\u2019s relatively healthy rates of productivity per\nhour in recent years have been achieved at the same\ntime as fast employment growth, since it might be\nexpected that the latter development would imply\nthe use of less productive workers. This section\nconcentrates on output per hour, since it is the most\ndirect indicator of productive efficiency.\nFigure 1 is reproduced from HM Treasury and DTI\n(2006). It demonstrates how the severely the UK\u2019s\nproductivity growth lagged behind France and Ger-\nmany in the 1950\u201373 period, though it was a little\nbetter than US performance. In the 1973\u201398 period,\nUK productivity growth continued to be slower than\nin France and Germany, but the differences were\nmuch smaller and it remained faster than in the\nUSA. Figure 2, taken from the same publication, is\nconcerned with levels of output per hour for the\nperiod 1990\u20132004. It shows how, in these more\n3 See, for example, O\u2019Mahoney (1999) and HM Treasury and DTI (2006).\n4 Advanced Institute of Management Research.\n5 Centre for Research on Skills, Knowledge and Organizational Performance.\n447\nK. Mayhew and A. Neely\nrecent years, there has been some catch-up with\nFrance, Germany, and the USA, though all three\ncountries remain ahead of the UK. Two other\ncomparator countries are also included\u2014Japan and\nCanada. The UK has also improved against both of\nthese countries and indeed its productivity per hour\nis now greater than theirs. Their introduction into the\npicture perhaps serves to remind us that not all is\ndoom and gloom. Compared to a number of major\ncountries the UK\u2019s productivity performance is\nhealthy.\nWhen measuring changes in productivity over time\nan important problem is how changes in output are\nFigure 1\nHistory of Growth Rate of GDPa per Hour Worked\nNote: a Average compound growth rate.\nSource: HM Treasury and DTI (2006) (Crown copyright).\nFigure 2\nOutput per Hour (UK = 100), 1990\u20132004\nSource: HM Treasury and DTI (2006) (Crown copyright).\nJapan\nUSA\nGermany\nFrance\nCanada\n448\nOXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY, VOL. 22, NO. 4\nmeasured. Obviously inflation effects have to be\nstripped out of the time series for output. However,\nthis does not mean that all price increases should be\nremoved. If a price increase genuinely reflects an\nincrease in the quality of the product, then that\nrepresents a real increase in the value of output and\nshould remain in the calculations. This is well known,\nbut how effectively official statisticians actually\ncope with this methodological issue is another mat-\nter. The article by Gustavo Crespi, Chiara Criscuolo,\nJonathan Haskel, and Denise Hawkes (Crespi et\nal., 2006) considers this issue in the context of\nmarket services. We return to the significance of\nthe measurement problem in the next section when\nwe discuss the relationship between productivity\nand competitiveness.\nIII. THE SOURCES OF\nPRODUCTIVITY GROWTH AND ITS\nRELATIONSHIP WITH\nCOMPETITIVENESS\n(i) The Five Drivers\nIn its official pronouncements the UK government\nemphasizes the five \u2018drivers of productivity growth\u2019\nand, indeed, publishes periodic scorecards designed\nto indicate how the country is improving the strength\nof these drivers (DTI, 2006). They are investment,\ninnovation, skills, enterprise, and competition. Be-\nfore this particular terminology entered the policy\ndiscourse, researchers used to describe productivity\ngrowth as stemming either from gains in static\nefficiency or gains in dynamic efficiency. Achieving\nstatic efficiency is equivalent to what welfare econo-\nmists would describe as achieving Pareto gains\u2014\nthat is using existing factors of production as effec-\ntively as possible. Arguably this is what much of Mrs\nThatcher\u2019s \u2018supply-side revolution\u2019 was about\u2014\nthe introduction of measures to make markets oper-\nate more competitively and efficiently. Dynamic\nefficiency is all about investment. Physical invest-\nment in new machinery and the like may embody\ntechnical progress, in which case a new machine\ndesigned to perform the same function as the one it\nreplaces will perform that function more effec-\ntively. Investment in knowledge (R&D), if success-\nfully translated into organizational operations, al-\nlows labour and capital to be put to more productive\nuse. Investment in human beings, whether in full-\ntime education or in the workplace, increases hu-\nman capital and\u2014it is assumed\u2014makes them more\nproductive.\nHow do the five drivers fit with this typology?\n\u2018investment\u2019 and \u2018skills\u2019 are most clearly linked to\ndynamic efficiency. \u2018Competition\u2019 appears to be\nmore closely related to static efficiency, while \u2018inno-\nvation\u2019 and \u2018enterprise\u2019 have both dynamic and\nstatic elements. But, of course, the picture is, in fact,\nmore complex than that. Take the example of lean\nmanufacturing. Presumably that would be classified\nas a \u2018static innovation\u2019. Yet to adopt lean manufac-\nturing techniques successfully a company might\nwell have to make investments in technology and in\nskills. Or, take the example of investment in skills.\nWhether such investment is funded by the govern-\nment or by the employer, the gains would only be\nfully realized if organizations actually deployed these\nnew skills appropriately. In both cases the initial\naction is insufficient on its own and other actions\n(whether public or private) are necessary. In the\nfirst example a static \u2018improvement\u2019 requires ac-\ncompanying investment. In the second example, an\ninvestment requires accompanying \u2018static\u2019 changes.\nClearly, a closer reading of government publications\nuncovers officialdom\u2019s awareness of this point and\nof the many complexities and interactions involved\nin the process of pulling a particular policy lever and\nobserving the final consequences. However, in\nfocusing the policy discourse on these drivers, we\nwould argue that there has been insufficient atten-\ntion paid to the interactions between the drivers, to\nthe organization of work and production within\norganizations, and to the interaction between policy\nand what is actually happening within organizations.\nOne dimension of this is the need to use more\nexplicitly what has been termed an \u2018open policy\nframework\u2019. This terminology is meant to reflect\nthe fact that companies who are engaged in interna-\ntional competition, and particularly those who are\nactually or potentially internationally mobile when\nmaking decisions about the location of their produc-\ntion, are unlikely to be thinking specifically about\nhow to make \u2018UK plc\u2019 a more a more productive or\neconomically efficient place. Rather, they are con-\ncerned about their own competitive position, which\nmight imply that they make decisions that are incon-\nsistent with the government\u2019s declared strategy and\nrhetoric\u2014specifically, their thinking may be much\n449\nK. Mayhew and A. Neely\nless UK-centric. In other words, there is a sort of\nprincipal\u2013agent problem. The utility functions of the\nagents (individual organizations) are not the same as\nthat of the government.\nAs suggested above, arguably UK policy under the\nThatcher and Major governments concentrated on\nreforms to achieve static efficiency gains. This was\nthe rhetoric of the supply-side revolution. Relatively\nlittle was done specifically to stimulate physical\ninvestment or investment in R&D. Or, at least,\npolicies to improve physical investment perform-\nance and R&D performance did not, on conven-\ntional measures, appear to have had much success.\nInvestment\/GDP ratios did not improve significantly.\nNor did R&D\/GDP ratios. The big exception on the\ninvestment side was education and training. If any-\nthing, the post-1997 Labour government has put\neven more emphasis on measures to improve edu-\ncation and training provision. There have been\nsignificant increases in both public and private ex-\npenditure, while outcomes\u2014at least in terms of\nqualifications\u2014have improved. But more generally\nthan this, the government has appeared to empha-\nsize the investment\/dynamic aspects rather more,\nas articulated in its five levers. However, invest-\nment\/GDP ratios remain stubbornly low, as do\nR&D\/GDP ratios. Figures 3, 4, and 5 illustrate the\npoint. Figure 3 shows the significant differences in\nterms of inputs invested in R&D between the UK\nand its major industrial competitors. In the 20 years\nto 2003, the UK has invested, on average, 2 per cent\nof annual GDP in R&D. This compares with the 2.6\nper cent for the USA and the 2.8 per cent for Japan.\nEven more striking, the UK investment as a propor-\ntion of GDP has fallen over this 20-year period, from\n2.2 per cent in 1983 to 1.9 per cent in 2003, while the\nUSA has remained stable in its commitments to\nR&D (from 2.6 per cent in 1983 to 2.7 per cent in\n2003) and Japan has increased its investment (from\n2.3 to 3.2 per cent, over the same period). Given\nthese trends, it is difficult to see how the UK can\nconform either to the UK government\u2019s own target\nof 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2014 or the European\nUnion target of 3 per cent by 2010.\nThe three significant contributors to gross domestic\nexpenditure on R&D (GERD) are business enter-\nprise (BERD), government (GOVERD), and higher\neducation (HERD).6 Figures 4 and 5 show the UK\u2019s\nperformance on the first two of these in the last 20\nyears.\nFigure 3\nGERD as a Percentage of GDP: UK vs Major Comparators\nSource: OECD Main Science and Technology Indicators.\n6 There is a fourth contributor to GERD\u2014private non-profit expenditure on R&D\u2014but this tends to be marginal, typically less\nthan 5 per cent of GERD.\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n19\n81\n19\n83\n19\n85\n19\n87\n19\n89\n19\n91\n19\n93\n19\n95\n19\n97\n19\n99\n20\n01\n20\n03\nPer cent of GDP\nJapan\nUSA\nGermany\nFrance\nUK\n450\nOXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY, VOL. 22, NO. 4\nFigure 4\nBERD Relative to GDP: UK vs Major Comparators\nSource: OECD Main Science and Technology Indicators.\nFigure 5\nGOVERD Relative to GDP: UK vs Major Comparators\nSource: OECD Main Science and Technology Indicators.\nAs Figure 4 shows, UK business expenditures on\nR&D relative to GDP have been decreasing (reach-\ning a level of 1.2 per cent by 2003), while the\ninvestments made by the UK\u2019s major comparator\ncountries have been increasing (in 2003 Germany\nwas 0.5 per cent above the UK, while the USA was\n0.6 per cent above the UK, and Japan 1.12 per\ncent). These differences are not a result of higher\nGDP growth rates in the UK relative to comparator\ncountries, but a consequence of a lower volume of\ninvestment in R&D (relative to country size). When\nwe look at the absolute levels of investment per\ncapita (at constant prices), the annual growth rate in\nBERD per capita between 1981 and 2003 was 1.5\n1\n1,4\n1,8\n2,2\n2,6\n19\n81\n19\n83\n19\n85\n19\n87\n19\n89\n19\n91\n19\n93\n19\n95\n19\n97\n19\n99\n20\n01\n20\n03\nPer cent of GDP\nJapan\nUSA\nGermany\nFrance\nUK\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n19\n81\n19\n83\n19\n85\n19\n87\n19\n89\n19\n91\n19\n93\n19\n95\n19\n97\n19\n99\n20\n01\n20\n03\nPer cent of \nGDP\nJapan\nUSA\nGermany\nFrance\nUK\n451\nK. Mayhew and A. Neely\nper cent for the UK, while the USA had an annual\ngrowth rate of 2.7 per cent and Japan had an annual\ngrowth rate of 4.5 per cent.\nA similar story emerges when we look at GOVERD.\nAs Figure 5 shows, UK GOVERD displays a\ndecreasing trend over the last 20 years. By 2003 the\nUK was the country with the lowest percentage of\nGOVERD to GDP (0.18 per cent). This compares\nto 0.33 per cent for the USA and 0.43 per cent for\nFrance. Moreover, in contrast with BERD, in the\ncase of GOVERD there is also a decreasing trend\nin terms of volume of investment per capita over the\nwhole period 1981\u20132003.\nThe one exception to these trends is HERD, where\nthe UK has followed a pattern of investment similar\nto that of its major competitors, both in terms of\ninvestment relative to GDP and investment per\ncapita (see Figure 6). It is worth noting that, regard-\ning HERD per capita, the UK has the second\nhighest annual growth rate over the period 1981\u2013\n2003, behind only the USA (3.5 per cent and 4.3 per\ncent, respectively).\n(ii) Productivity in the Short or Long Run?\nProductivity is not an end in its own right. It is a\nmeans to an end. Of particular importance here is its\nrelationship with competitiveness. The nature of this\nrelationship depends on whether we are considering\ncompetitiveness in the short run or in the long run. In\nthe short run, competitiveness is about price. Every-\nthing else (labour costs, profit margins, and ex-\nchange rates) being equal, faster relative growth of\nproductivity means an increase in international com-\npetitiveness. As Boltho (1996) discussed, competi-\ntiveness in the longer run is a more complex matter\nand different authorities provide rather different\ndefinitions. Following the OECD, policy-makers\nwould be concerned to help construct an economy\nwhere British firms as a whole could maintain their\nshares of international markets while the gains from\ntrade were widely distributed across the country\u2019s\npopulation. This is not the same as maintaining\nshort-run cost and price competitiveness. Indeed,\nfor a country like the UK, competing simply on price\nseems not to be an option in the modern international\ncommunity, not least because the cost base of the\nUK is considered too high to compete with cheaper\nforeign locations. Even if it were an option, the\nconsequential squeeze on labour costs would have\nunfortunate distributional implications. Rather, the\nUK needs to compete on quality and product niche.\nIn the context of this issue there are two implica-\ntions. The measurement of productivity change\nwhich makes adequate allowance for quality changes\nover time takes on an added imperative, simply as a\nmatter of knowing where we are now and where we\nare heading. Second, sources of productivity change\nwhich are consistent with maintaining or moving\ntowards a higher value-added strategy are to be\nFigure 6\nHERD Relative to GDP: UK vs Major Comparators\nSource: OECD Main Science and Technology Indicators.\n0,2\n0,25\n0,3\n0,35\n0,4\n0,45\n19\n81\n19\n83\n19\n85\n19\n87\n19\n89\n19\n91\n19\n93\n19\n95\n19\n97\n19\n99\n20\n01\n20\n03\nPer cent of GDP\nJapan\nUSA\nGermany\nFrance\nUK\n452\nOXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY, VOL. 22, NO. 4\npreferred to those which simply involve maintaining\na low value-added route. This is the social impera-\ntive. The private interests of individual firms may be\ndifferent. Critically, we need to be wary of policy\ninitiatives which (wittingly or unwittingly) provide\nsignals and\/or incentives to agents in the economy\nthat discourage or militate against moves to the\nhigher value-added route. Or, to put the matter more\npositively, we need to seek out policy initiatives\nwhich positively incentivize organizations to take the\nhigher value-added road.\nIV. WHAT GOES ON INSIDE THE\nFIRM?\n(i) Education and Training\nOne of the five drivers is \u2018skills\u2019. There has been a\nhuge increase in the supply of educated and trained\npeople. The article by Ewart Keep, Ken Mayhew,\nand Jonathan Payne (Keep et al., 2006) reminds us\nthat simply increasing the supply of educated and\ntrained people may be a necessary condition for\nincreasing productivity, but that it may not be a\nsufficient one. The key questions are how effec-\ntively skills are utilized by employers and also how\nmotivated individuals are to use their skills. The\nanswers will depend on a complex of factors influ-\nencing the skill intensity of the production process.\nThe demand for skills from employers cannot be\nneglected. This observation is consistent with the\ninconclusive microeconometric evidence on the re-\nlationship between work-related training and pro-\nductivity. Until recently, most of this work has been\ninferential, reflecting problems of collecting reliable\nmicro data on productivity. Much of this work finds\na positive relationship between training and wages,\nassumes that higher wages reflect higher productiv-\nity, and therefore infers a positive impact of training\non productivity. In a recent review article, Edwin\nLeuven (2004) makes some interesting observa-\ntions about this approach. He concludes that the\nmajority of these studies, which rely on fixed-\neffects modelling, probably overestimate the \u2018re-\nturns\u2019 to training. The main reason for this is the\nfailure of such studies to allow adequately for other\ncharacteristics of those who receive training which\nwould make them more productive and therefore\nhigher earners. Dearden et al. (2006) claim to\nprovide direct evidence on the relationship between\ntraining and productivity \u2018for the first time for the\nUK and for the first time anywhere over a long\nperiod\u2019. They remind us that only in a strict neoclas-\nsical model would wages be a direct measure of\nproductivity. However, they contend, since \u2018in-\ncreases in wages have to be paid out of productivity\ngains, real wage increases should provide a lower\nbound on the probable size of productivity increases\u2019.\nThey argue that the few studies which investigate\nthe relationship directly are flawed because the\ntraining is measured at only one point in time \u2018and\ncould be picking up many unobservable firm specific\nfactors correlated with both training and productiv-\nity\u2019. Their own modelling suggests that \u2018a 1% point\nincrease in training is associated with an increase in\nvalue added per hour of about 0.6%\u2019. However,\neven their methodology may be picking up some\nspurious effects. For example, although capital per\nworker is included in their regressions, it is not clear\nwhether this is adequate to pick up the impact of\ncapital investment, its time profile, and the possibility\nof embodied technical progress.\nThe most important point, however, is that even if\nsome impact of training on productivity is detected,\nthis is perfectly consistent with the argument that\nhow much (if any) impact training has depends on\nthe accompanying product and production strate-\ngies of the organization in which the training takes\nplace. Thus particular increments in education and\ntraining provision cannot be guaranteed to have\npositive impacts on economic performance. A re-\nlated issue is revealed by consideration of the\nadequacy of training data used. Generally, econo-\nmetricians working in this area use identified train-\ning episodes as their independent variable. Of course,\nresearchers can use only what is available, but in\nadopting this approach they may be only partially\ncapturing training broadly defined. They are almost\ncertainly neglecting on-the-job training and develop-\nment, which are closely linked to the precise nature\nof the production process and of job design. Reali-\nzation of this point, that the accumulation of human\ncapital is in part endogenously determined, might\nslightly change the focus of policy.\n(ii) Management Skills and Practices\nManagement skills and practices are analysed in\ngreat depth in this issue. In terms of the five drivers,\nwe can think of these as falling under the general\n453\nK. Mayhew and A. Neely\nheading of innovation and, more specifically, man-\nagement innovation. Case-based data in manage-\nment studies illustrate the many management inno-\nvations that have occurred in organizations, for\nexample just-in-time production, total quality man-\nagement, and business process re-engineering. One\nchallenge for researchers is the faddish nature of\nthese management innovations. While the underly-\ning principles may be consistent, the persistent\nintroduction of so-called management innovations\nmakes their study problematic. One of the current\ninnovations that is in vogue is Six Sigma, yet many\nhave argued that Six Sigma is little more than a\ncareful repackaging of quality tools and techniques\nthat have been discussed in various guises since the\n1950s. Even if tools and techniques were not con-\nstantly being recycled, it can be difficult to evaluate\nthe real significance and impact of these develop-\nments as the same terminology can describe prac-\ntices which differ greatly in their real content and\nappropriateness. Some data, which might allow\nresearchers to probe more deeply into these issues,\nhave existed within the firms for a long time, but\nmany researchers have found it very difficult to\naccess such data. There are a number of reasons\nfor this. First, such data are usually proprietary and\nfirms, not surprisingly, are concerned about the\ncompetitive implications of releasing them. Second,\naccessing the data requires researchers to build\ndeep relationships with senior managers in firms,\nmany of whom see little benefit in working with\nacademics to explore intellectually interesting ques-\ntions unless they have direct practical relevance. A\nnumber of papers in this issue make great strides to\nrectify this situation and allow us to start to open the\nblack box and to investigate what actually goes on\nwithin organizations. In their article in this issue,\nRachel Griffith, Jonathan Haskel, and Andy Neely\n(Griffith et al., 2006a), for example, look at manage-\nment quality within a firm and conclude that it is a\nsignificant determinant of productivity differences\nbetween the firm\u2019s different establishments. Thus,\neven in a single organization which attempts to\nestablish a common set of practices and procedures\nfor all of its establishments, there is considerable\nheterogeneity of productivity outcomes. According\nto the data, management quality is a major factor in\nexplaining this heterogeneity, although additional\nstudies within the firm also highlight the heterogene-\nity of practice even within the same organization. Of\ncourse, the authors have to tackle the difficult, and\nonly partially resolved, issue of how to measure\nquality. Eschewing input (for example, educational\nattainment) or process (management practices)\nindicators, they opt for a variety of \u2018outcome\u2019\nindicators. Adopting a \u2018balanced scorecard\u2019 ap-\nproach, they compare establishments on indicators\nsuch as customer satisfaction, stock availability, and\noperational standards. Importantly, the variables\nused in this study are those that have been defined\nas significant by the managers of the firm rather\nthan the researchers. In essence, Griffith et al.\n(2006a) use data that the firm generates to manage\nits own performance to explore productivity varia-\ntions. The great advantage of this is that the per-\nformance variables used are meaningful to the\norganization and its competitive context. This is\nsomething that is often overlooked in many aca-\ndemic studies, where more traditional, but arm\u2019s\nlength\u2014at least to the firm\u2014measures of perform-\nance are proposed.\nGriffith et al. (2006a) is representative of a new\narea of research\u2014micro studies within firms and\neconometric case studies. Their study is grounded in\nthe UK. Derek Jones, Panu Kalmi, and Antti\nKauhanen (Jones et al., 2006) are representative of\na similar approach in a different national context\u2014\nFinland. They describe a series of microeconometric\nstudies of branches within the same (retailing) firm.\nThey find that different interpretations and imple-\nmentations of a given firm\u2019s human resource man-\nagement (HRM) policies by managers at individual\nestablishments have an effect on productivity. What\nthey describe as \u2018on-the-job participation\u2019 and \u2018in-\nformation sharing\u2019 are found to be of particular\nsignificance. Thus, in contrast to Griffith et al.\n(2006a), they use process as opposed to output\nindicators. But what both studies demonstrate is the\nelusiveness of the concept of management quality,\nat least when it comes to taking external action to\nimprove it. Managers who have the same level of\ntraining and education and who are subject to the\nsame head office guidelines, policies, and con-\nstraints, produce very different performances and\noutcomes. This serves to remind us that the govern-\nment\u2019s levers can have weak or uncertain pur-\nchase.\nChanging management practices may be designed\nto extract greater productivity but they carry the\ndanger that the actual or perceived welfare of\n454\nOXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY, VOL. 22, NO. 4\nworkers suffers as a consequence if they involve\nwork intensification, loss of discretion, or intense\nsupervision. This could imply indirect, harmful con-\nsequences for productivity because of the damage\ncaused to worker morale. Nick Bloom and John\nVan Reenen (2006) give us partial, but not full,\nreassurance here. Analysing a sample of over 700\nmedium-sized manufacturing firms in the UK, the\nUSA, France, and Germany, they find that manage-\nment quality is associated with higher productivity,\nbut that, contrary to the perceptions of some com-\nmentators, good \u2018work\u2013life balance\u2019 practices are\nassociated with higher management quality. Thus,\nthey argue, this route to better productivity perform-\nance is not inimical to the quality of working life. This\ngives us only partial reassurance for two reasons.\nFirst, their sample is confined to manufacturing; we\nneed to know more about other sectors. Second,\ntheir research discusses work\u2013life balance largely\nin terms of family-friendly policies. While these are\nimportant, they do not cover important dimensions\nof modern employment\u2014work intensification and\ndiscretion at work. Both of these dimensions are\nparticularly important in the context of the declining\ninfluence of unions. The work of Green and others7\nsuggests strongly that recent years have witnessed\nsignificant loss of discretion in a whole variety of\nrespects\u2014for example, the allocation of time to\ndifferent tasks, the way a task is performed, and the\ntime allowed to complete it. This development has\nbeen a feature of jobs across the whole spectrum\nand not just among the less skilled. The conse-\nquences for productivity are uncertain and will\ndepend on each specific workplace setting.\n(iii) Innovation and Corporate Restructuring\nMoving on from management skills and practices,\nbut still falling under the heading of innovation, we\nturn to some questions concerning structural change\nof various types within organizations. Mari Sako\n(2006) discusses one aspect of structural change in\nher article on productivity in business services. She\ncontrasts this sector with manufacturing. Manufac-\nturing has seen productivity growth, and the gap\nwith the USA has been largely closed. In part this is\nbecause unproductive firms have closed in the UK.\nThus productivity growth has been accompanied by\na decline in employment in the sector. By contrast,\nin business services productivity growth has been\naccompanied by employment growth. It is also a\nsector which has witnessed substantial outsourcing\nand offshoring. The state of knowledge is such that\nwe cannot precisely disentangle the various sources\nof productivity growth. But Sako points out that, in\ngeneral terms, productivity growth can come from\ntwo sources. The first is from \u2018standardizing and\nconsolidating processes\u2019. The other is from \u2018moving\ninto higher-value-added activities\u2019. Either can occur\nwhen a firm restructures via vertical disintegration\nor via the unbundling of corporate functions. As far\nas offshoring and outsourcing are concerned, Sako\nraises at least three (not necessarily mutually exclu-\nsive) possibilities. The first is that offshoring allows\ncompanies to engage in a variety of forms of work\nintensification and HRM practices which extract\ngreater \u2018effort\u2019 from the workforce. The second is\nthat the tendency of companies to outsource certain\nactivities to specialist business service firms allows\nthe latter to obtain economies of scale from a variety\nof sorts from specialization. The third, which could\nbe linked or not to outsourcing (or for that matter\noffshoring), is improvement in the \u2018quality\u2019 of serv-\nice which allows an increase in price to reflect this\nhigher quality and thus an increase in productivity\nmeasured on a value-added basis. She emphasizes\nthat at the moment we do not have enough data to\npin down the precise nature of these phenomena.\nFor instance, we are surprisingly ignorant of the\nrelative skill content of functions which are offshored.\nHowever, her article does serve to remind us of the\nneed to think in terms of the open policy framework\nmentioned earlier. Organizations are not necessar-\nily confining their thinking to the UK when consid-\nering how to improve productivity, or whether they\nwill cut costs and maintain existing product specifi-\ncation, or move to higher-value-added production.\n(iv) Innovation and R&D\nAgain exploiting firm-level data, Rachel Griffith,\nElena Huergo, Jacques Mairesse, and Bettina Pe-\nters (Griffith et al., 2006b) explore another dimen-\nsion of innovation for four countries\u2014France, Ger-\nmany, Spain, and the UK. They make the point that\nexpenditure on R&D is one thing, while its imple-\nmentation and exploitation is another. They set up a\nfour-equation model to describe four stages of the\n7 See, for example, Felstead et al. (2002) and Green (2006).\n455\nK. Mayhew and A. Neely\nprocess: the amount of effort directed towards\ninnovation; the extent of investment in R&D; the\ninfluence of this investment on knowledge leading to\nprocess and product innovation; and the impact of\nthis knowledge on output. Their results suggest that,\nin terms of productivity, Germany has little more to\ngain from innovation, France could gain from both\nproduct and process innovation, while Spain and the\nUK could gain from product innovation.\nV. IMPLICATIONS\nGood productivity performance is a means to an\nend. From the perspective of the national economic\ninterest, it is a route towards achieving a more\ninternationally competitive economy. Our arguments\nsuggest that it is competitiveness in the long run that\nshould be of more vital interest to any government\nthan competitiveness in the short run. This has\nimplications for both policy and research. For the\npolicy-maker the message is to beware of measures\nwhich might encourage organizations to adopt short-\nrun productivity-enhancing measures at the ex-\npense of \u2018moving up market\u2019. In other words,\nproductivity gains can be achieved either by in-\ncreasing \u2018efficiency\u2019 of production for any given\nquality of product or by increasing quality and\ntherefore the value-added price. There can be little\ndoubt as to which is the preferable route. Otherwise,\nsignificant proportions of British workers will be\nconfined to low-rewarding jobs and possibly to jobs\nof high work intensity and low discretion. For re-\nsearchers, the message is to put more effort into\ngetting the right measures of productivity growth\nwhich accurately reflect quality improvements.\nWithout this, it will be difficult to monitor exactly\nwhat progress is being made.\nThe government realizes that it is important to be\naware of the relative importance of the different\nfactors that might influence productivity. This is\nevident, for example, in HM Treasury and DTI\n(2006, ch. 4), where various estimated effects of\nparticular variables are mentioned, such estimates\nbeing typically derived from the econometric appli-\ncation of growth-accounting techniques. However,\nit is equally important for researchers to help make\nthe government more acutely aware that the ulti-\nmate impact of, for instance, any given increase in\ntraining or education or in spending on R&D de-\npends critically upon complex, interwoven strings of\ncausation which are not necessarily constant over\ntime. Getting within the black box of the organization\nwill help us unravel some of these strings. We see\nsignificant variations even within a very homogene-\nous set of branches of an individual organization.\nThis is where micro case studies and micro-\neconometric case studies are starting to be of\nassistance. But these are very early days.\nIt is also important to consider the role of national\npolicy in light of globalization and the trends towards\noffshoring and outsourcing. Today\u2019s global busi-\nnesses are choosing to source support from a wide\nvariety of geographical locations. India and China\nare rapidly emerging as significant centres\u2014both of\nthis support and of knowledge production more\ngenerally. The challenge for the UK is to consider\nwhether the country should adopt a competitive or\ncooperative stance with regard to these economies.\nThe traditional model of policy formulation asks\nwhat should the UK do. An alternative model\nwould ask how can the UK leverage develop-\nments in other countries. Does the UK need to\nencourage concentration on all five of the Treas-\nury\u2019s drivers to close the productivity gap, or would\nit be better advised to explore how it might collabo-\nrate with other countries to share the burdens of\ninvestment. This is tantamount to policy-makers\nadopting an \u2018open policy\u2019 framework in the same\nway that many firms are now describing their\ninnovation activity as \u2018open innovation\u2019. Firms rec-\nognize that they do not have the monopoly on good\nideas and innovations. Instead, they have to build the\ncapability to access the innovations of others and, in\nreturn, allow others to access their innovations. If\nthe same thinking process were adopted for policy,\nthen the challenge for the UK would be how the\ncountry can access the investment, innovation, skills,\nenterprise, and competition developed by other\neconomies.\nSuch thinking requires a significant shift towards\njoined-up policy. Yet one of the constraints that\nhinders this is the fact that different arms of govern-\nment have responsibility for different policy drivers.\nThe Department for Education and Skills, for exam-\nple, is charged with increasing the stock of educated\nand trained labour. The Department for Trade and\nIndustry lays claim to innovation policy and business\nregulation, which clearly links to enterprise and\n456\nOXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY, VOL. 22, NO. 4\nREFERENCES\nBloom, N., and Van Reenen, J.
