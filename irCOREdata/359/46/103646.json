The Open Access (OA) movement is one of those challenges, and one \nthat often generates passionate arguments amongst librarians, researchers and \npublishers.  However, I would like to step away from that debate, and focus on the \npractical progress we are making with opening access to research papers at a \ntypical red brick university.   \n \nMeeting the needs of researchers \nAcademic researchers need and want to publish in order to be recognised for the \nwork that they do, and to build up collaborations and a career profile. Their \nemployers in university senior management support any method for showcasing the \nquality of the University\u2019s research.  Everyone wants their work to be credited and \nhighly cited, and to impress potential research funders.  This is traditionally done by \npublishing papers in peer-reviewed journals.  \n  \nThe reasons why researchers, their employers and their funders want to make their \nwork openly accessible have been set out by many advocates2,3. There are many \npolitical and ethical arguments that publicly-funded research is a public good.  We \nhave adopted a non-campaigning approach, trying to avoid emotion or \noverstatement, and concentrating on the key argument in favour of OA, which is that \nthe more people who can find and read a piece of work, the more chance there is of \nits being cited.  In some subject disciplines, established OA archives such as (UK) \nPubMed Central4 and Arxiv5 are gaining pre-eminence. In addition, many funders \nnow have an OA mandate (ie a policy that requires that publications or other results \narising from funded research must be made openly accessible). \n \nOur university senior management, through the Research and Knowledge Transfer \nCommittee, are very willing to encourage authors of research papers to publish in \nOA outlets.  They are not yet ready to push (as some universities have done) for a \nmandate to compel them to do that, but they do want to help researchers choose OA \nwhere appropriate.  \n \nRoutes to Open Access \nBefore going on, I will clarify the shorthand in common use, referring to the green \nand gold routes to open access6.  Green means that the author publishes in a \nconventional subscription-access journal and then places a copy of their paper, or a \nfinal draft of it, into either a subject OA repository or an institutional repository (IR). \nGold means that a fee is paid to the journal publisher (typically around \u00a31,500) to \nrelease that paper on the journal\u2019s own website. \n \nWhy are we paving the path with gold at Birmingham when we have an institutional \nrepository?  In fact we are promoting both green and gold OA, but the take up of the \ngreen route is slow.  This is typical of the sector, where IRs are generally underused. \n \nThere are also many misunderstandings about open access7,8. For example, \nbecause libraries and publishers have worked hard to provide seamless access, \nthere\u2019s a mistaken belief that all online journals are OA.  Some researchers think that \nOA only applies to informal, non-peer-reviewed material such as working papers, or \nthey are uneasy about using an author\u2019s final version and don\u2019t know which version \nto cite.  \n \nWe are finding that for many authors, gold OA publishing fits their established \nroutines and workflows more readily than green self-archiving.  Although green has \nthe advantage that no author-side fees are payable, the most common practical \ndifficulty with this route is getting authors into the habit of keeping a final draft of the \npaper, suitable for the IR. Some researchers also say that an embargo period on \ngreen archiving (often imposed by publishers, where the article may not be released \non OA for several months or even a year or two after publication) delays the \navailability and impact of their work, so they believe it is worth paying a fee for the \narticle to be released immediately.   \n \nA small number of research groups work on hugely expensive projects, where a few \nthousand pounds in OA fees to open up the results of the project seems a \nreasonable expense. In some disciplines, journal publishers have for years required \npage charges and extra fees for illustrations etc, so authors are already accustomed \nto paying publication fees.  To many others, the OA fees represent an impossibly \nlarge sum of money to find.  Thus, there are very different cultures within the \nUniversity.  \n \nThe University of Birmingham pilot study \nMotivated by the messages coming from the funders and policy bodies, senior \nmanagement wanted to ensure that we had a process in place for supporting OA.  \nThe Library, being the central service administering journal subscriptions, was \nreceiving regular enquiries about OA memberships and article fees, but did not have \na budget to cover them.  As mentioned above, self-archiving in our IR did not meet \nevery researcher\u2019s needs or preferences.  Another problem that we encounter \nfrequently is that by the time papers have been published, the project is finished and \nthe grant has been wound up, so there is no longer a financial link between the \nproject and the publication.  Everyone was concerned about the possible costs, so \nwe agreed to track OA publishing activity, expenditure, reactions and impacts.  A \nnew central fund (separate from the Library budget but equivalent to nearly 5% of \nour Library allocation for serials subscriptions) was set up for one financial year, to \npay eligible fees.  Alongside this, we were anxious to find out about spending on OA \nvia research grant budgets held in other parts of the University.   \n \nIt would be impossible to do this quickly across the whole University, so we set up a \npilot study. We began by looking at where our research funding is coming from. \nAmongst our top sources of income were the Medical Research Council (MRC)9 who \nstate in quite strong terms how output from their projects should be made openly \naccessible, and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council \n(EPSRC)10 who encourage OA but are less specific.  Of all of our funders, the \nWellcome Trust11 has for many years been a strong advocate of OA and provided \nadditional financial support for this. We already had a system in place to help \nWellcome-funded researchers pay article processing fees. So, we included them, \nand rolled out the Wellcome model to the whole pilot.  We briefly considered \nincluding a humanities or social sciences subject, but felt we needed to show how \nthe process could work where OA is already partially established, before bringing \nabout a change of culture in a new area. \n  \nData already available to the project \nWe are working closely with our Research and Commercial Services department \n(the team that helps researchers to bid for grants and sponsorship) who hold data \nabout project funding and grantholders.  \n \nWe are also lucky to have a comprehensive record of publishing activity across the \nUniversity, in a system originally set up for research monitoring and the Research \nAssessment Exercise.  It holds metadata for nearly all of the research publications \nproduced at the University since 2001. This was interrogated for a report of the \njournals where our authors have been publishing most frequently in recent years, so \nwe were able to check their rights policies and options for green and\/or gold OA.  \n \nPracticalities  \n\u2022 Using details of projects that are funded by the three organisations included in \nthe pilot, we emailed the researchers with information about the project and \ndiscussed it with the relevant Directors of Research and Knowledge Transfer and \nResearch Committees.   \n\u2022 Web pages have been set up informing researchers of their publishing options, \nand authors writing up papers are encouraged to contact the project manager in \nthe Library at any time during the submission of their papers. \n\u2022 When an author enquires about publishing in a particular journal, we advise them \nof the options available for that journal\/publisher and whether it meets the \nfunder\u2019s requirements for open access, eg if the embargo period is appropriate.  \n\u2022 To check whether an author is eligible to call on the central fund to pay the article \nprocessing fees, we simply check that the funder and the University are \nacknowledged in the article.  Most funders have prescribed wording for this.   \n\u2022 Applicants for new grants are advised to include a realistic figure for covering an \nappropriate OA method (however, there is a tension between ensuring that costs \nare predicted, and not bidding too high for a research project).   \n\u2022 Throughout all of our discussions we are careful to stress that researchers are \nfree to choose to publish in any high-quality high-impact peer-reviewed journals. \nThe project is not forcing authors to publish in journals that they would not \notherwise choose.  \n\u2022 Working with our Finance department, we now have systems in place for paying \nand monitoring costs, and reporting back to the funders. \n \nAbove all, the project brings a good opportunity to discuss OA with researchers and \nsenior managers.  We are building up an interesting record of activity and costs for \nanalysis and, later, to assess the impact of OA publishing. \n \nSupporting green OA \nIn parallel, we also want to encourage use of the IR as a route to open access and \nalso to be an archive of all of the University\u2019s research work. To make it easier and \nmore attractive to use, we are repurposing our existing collection of publications \nmetadata, which was previously held in a closed system, but will soon be exposed to \nthe web via our ePrints software.  This will enable researchers easily to populate \ntheir web pages with a record of their work and to link to the full text wherever it is \navailable.  We see this as a stepping stone to help researchers in all disciplines to \nbecome familiar with and adopt self-archiving.  The metadata will be held separately \nfrom our main IR, because we do not want to dilute our policy of full-text in the IR.  \n(The collection of metadata is not eligible for eg OpenDOAR12, but the metadata will \nstill be compliant with OAI-PMH13 and exposed to search engines.) \n \nThe process is partly automated, with metadata harvested from several sources and \nmatched against internal systems.  For some OA publishers, we can make a full \ncircle, eg we pay for an article to be published in PLoS, who forward the article and \nmetadata to PubMed and PubMed Central. We use the PMCID or DOI in our system \nto harvest the metadata back, and in turn link to the published full text and also to a \ncopy in our own IR.  \n \nBuilding closer links between existing systems and the IR will help to overcome \nsome of the practical hurdles to self-archiving.  By analysing data about the journals \nin which authors have been publishing, we can target priority material suitable for \ndeposit in our IR. \n \nUptake of gold OA \nWe have taken out institutional memberships with the open access publishers that \nare most frequently used by our authors. Those memberships not only secure us a \ndiscount for each paper published, but they let researchers see that the University is \nsupporting them to do this. Researchers are also choosing to publish in hybrid \njournals (traditional journals with OA options at article level).  \n \nIt is still early in the project, but interestingly, the uptake reflects the weight the \nfunders put behind OA.  Wellcome-funded researchers have published the most \narticles through the central fund, followed by MRC then EPSRC.  We also know from \nthe publishers that where authors do have grants available, they are paying OA fees \nfrom those live research grants, and we will analyse this activity together with \nexpenditure on our central fund.  \n \nWe expect uptake to increase rapidly as the research projects themselves come to \nan end.  At Birmingham, researchers publish about 3,500 peer-reviewed articles a \nyear. Even if it were possible or desirable to make them all openly accessible \nthrough the gold route, we would not be able to afford this, and the central budgets \navailable for the pilot study could cover OA fees for approx 2-3% of these articles.  \nThis is another reason, under the current publishing regime, to make the green route \nas attractive as possible.  \n \nWhat we are beginning to find out \n\u2022 How much of our publishing activity is related to funded research \n\u2022 Preferred journals - these reflect today\u2019s publishing industry as a whole, but there \nis growing interest in hybrid and OA titles with good impact factors \n\u2022 The vast majority of papers are published in journals with some form of OA: gold, \ngreen or both \n\u2022 The true cost of OA fees - this was previously underestimated and researchers \nhave to decide whether gold OA represents value for money \n\u2022 Interest in OA publishing from authors who are not funded \n\u2022 Internal financial and admin systems that we need to have in place  \n\u2022 Researchers appear to be motivated by funders\u2019 requirements more than by the \nintrinsic benefits of OA \n\u2022 Researchers suspect that few funders are actually following up on OA mandates \n\u2022 Authors aren\u2019t interested in a journal\u2019s business model - they choose a journal for \ntheir paper based only on its reputation \n\u2022 Once the paper has been accepted, researchers move onto the next piece of \nwork, so they appreciate administrative support such as following up payments  \n\u2022 Researchers are not interested in copyright and the rights of the author, \nemployer, funder or publisher \n\u2022 It isn\u2019t always clear what the OA fee buys, so we need to check that it does buy \nthe rights we expect, and that articles are released on time \n\u2022 Journals will stand or fall by their reputation for rigour and peer-review - any \nsuspicion that gold OA is diluting this will make journals less attractive to \nresearchers \n\u2022 For relevant disciplines, having a citation in PubMed is essential - though there is \nconfusion between having an article openly available in PubMed Central and just \nhaving the citation in PubMed \n \nImpact of research \nIt is going to take a while to see a measurable impact for articles published this year, \nbut other people have carried out research on this topic14. It needs an expert in \nbibliometrics and statistics to analyse correlations and factors for cause and effect.  \nNevertheless, we can start to look at the reputation of the journals that researchers \nare choosing, and at the impact of papers published in the past. \n \nImpact on academic publishing \nOne of the reasons for supporting gold OA is the promise that it will begin to make \nan impact on the subscription costs of hybrid journals.  Open access fees are going \nup steadily, but subscriptions do not yet seem to be coming down so rapidly.  \nPublishers say this is because of the low uptake of gold OA, but we will be watching \nwhether this changes over the coming months and years. \n \nEconomic modelling by Houghton and others15,16 indicates that if there was a \nwholesale flip over to OA, with article processing fees set to cover the costs of peer-\nreview and publishing, there would be a net benefit to research and development \nand higher education overall. These findings have generated controversy, but at the \ntime of writing, no alternative model has yet been proposed.  We tried this model at \nBirmingham, taking into account subscription charges and other costs of managing \nlibrary collections, and found potential for savings, provided that the article \nprocessing fees remain reasonable. \n \nThe key question for our researchers is: what price do you put on a reputation?  \n \nConclusion  \nOpen access publishing can bring many advantages in visibility and impact.  \nHowever, it is not yet fully understood by academic researchers and authors, and \ngreen OA has not yet reached its full potential.  By approaching OA from the needs \nof researchers and funders, and by giving authors the option to choose the gold \nroute if they wish, we have an opportunity to enter into dialogue with them and to \nmonitor the extent of OA publishing activity. \n \nThe business model of publishing is under scrutiny, and we are just one university \nthat contributes and purchases information.  UKSG is a unique forum for librarians, \npublishers and agents to meet together, and I hope our practical experience at \nBirmingham will help to inform the ongoing debate17.  Publishers provide a valuable \nservice in arranging editorial standards and peer-review, but this needs to be at a fair \nprice. At present there are concerns about the spiralling costs of the gold route.   \n \nThe priority for our pilot is to ensure that our researchers are aware of the \nappropriate publishing options available not only to support the OA mandates from \ntheir funding councils, but also to make their work widely available. It is not the \nintention to promote fee-based open access publishing, but to make it possible for \nauthors to choose this option where they believe it is best for their work.  Equally \nimportant is simply to raise awareness of the approaches to open access and the \ngreen and gold routes available.  \n \nReferences \nAll websites were accessed in April 2010 \n \n1.
