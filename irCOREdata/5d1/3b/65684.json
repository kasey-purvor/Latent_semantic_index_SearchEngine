MacIntyre\u201fs critique of managers in After Virtue (1985) serves \nas the starting point but this critique is itself subjected to analysis leading to a more \nbalanced and contemporary view of the morality of management than MacIntyre \nprovides. Paradoxically perhaps, MacIntyre\u201fs own virtues-goods-practice-institution \nschema is shown to provide a way of re-imagining business organisations and \nmanagement and thereby holds out the possibility of resolving the issue of the \nmorality of management within such organisations. Implications for management \npractice are drawn out. \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe British newspaper The Observer carried the following as part of an article \npublished on 9 April 1944. It referred to Albert Speer, Hitler\u201fs Minister for armaments \nand war production. It suggested that even though Speer was not one of the more \nflamboyant Nazis, he was more important to Germany than Hitler, Himmler, Goering, \nor the generals. For Speer \n \n\u201cis very much the successful average man, well-dressed, civil, noncorrupt, \nvery middle class in his style of life, with a wife and six children. Much less \nthan any of the other German leaders does he stand for anything particularly \nGerman or particularly Nazi. He rather symbolises a type which is becoming \nincreasingly important in all belligerent countries: the pure technician, the \nclassless bright young man without background, with no other original aim \nthan to make his way in the world and no other means than his technical and \nmanagerial ability. It is the lack of psychological and spiritual ballast, and the \nease with which he handles the terrifying technical and organizational \n 2 \nmachinery of our age, which makes this type go extremely far nowadays  \u2026 \nThis is their age; the Hitlers, the Himmlers we may get rid of, but the Speers, \nwhatever happens to this particular special man, will long be with us.\u201d (Cited \nin Hauerwas 2001: 214) \n \nThis quote, and the \u201ccalculating instinct\u201d associated with it (see ten Bos & Willmott \n2001: 782),\n1\n  brings home with some force the issue with which this paper is \nconcerned \u2013 the amorality, or perhaps better and more hopefully, the morality of \nmanagement. Although I will suggest at the end that the model of management, and \nhence the morality of management, that I propose has universal application, the paper \nconfines itself to the problematic nature of the morality of management in business \norganisations operating under Anglo-American capitalism. The paper seeks to provide \na resolution to this issue by putting in place an overarching conceptual framework, \ndrawing on the work of the moral philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, within which the \nmorality of management can be situated and given substantive content. I term this a \nmodern virtue ethics approach (see also Moore 2002; 2005a; 2005b).  \n \nThe paper is in four main parts. It begins with the work of Alasdair MacIntyre and, in \nparticular, his contention that the morality of modernity is one of emotivism and that \nthis is revealed nowhere better than in the character of the manager found in \nbureaucratic organisations. His apparently devastating critique, however, is in need of \ntempering and up-dating and so the second part of the paper introduces MacIntyre\u201fs \ncritics, reviews the contemporary debate on bureaucracy and summarises \ncontemporary approaches to management and management ethics. The conclusion \nfrom this is that a more nuanced account of MacIntyre\u201fs critique does have continuing \napplication and relevance; the morality of management in business organisations \nunder Anglo-American capitalism continues to be problematic. The third part of the \npaper, then, looks at MacIntyre\u201fs own conceptual virtues-goods-practice-institution \nschema and demonstrates how it has the potential to provide an answer to the \nproblem. The implications of this schema for management in general, and the \nmorality of management in particular, are then discussed in the fourth part, before \nconclusions are drawn. \n \n \n 3 \nI. MacIntyre \u2013 emotivism and the critique of management \n \nMacIntyre\u201fs critique of management is set within the context of his broader critique of \nmodernity. Here he contends that we live in what he refers to as a specifically \nemotivist culture. Emotivism \u201cis the doctrine that all evaluative judgments and more \nspecifically all moral judgments are nothing but expressions of preference, \nexpressions of attitude or feeling, insofar as they are moral or evaluative in character\u201d \n(MacIntyre 1985: 11-12, emphasis in original). As such, we attempt to align the \nattitudes, feelings, preferences and choices of others with our own \u2013 \u201cothers are \nalways means, never ends\u201d (ibid.: 24) \u2013 and hence emotivism \u201centails the obliteration \nof any genuine distinction between manipulative and non-manipulative social \nrelations\u201d (ibid.: 23). In other words, since there is no content to moral judgments \nother than the preference of the subject, social relations inevitably become \nmanipulative, the subject treating the object merely as a means to his or her own ends.  \n \nThis is, of course, both a powerful but also a contentious critique of modernity. \nHowever, it is reinforced by post-modern perspectives. Bauman, for example, argues \nthat there are \u201cmany agencies, and many ethical standards, whose presence casts the \nindividual in a condition of moral uncertainty from which there is no completely \nsatisfactory, foolproof exit \u2026 the modern individual [is] bombarded by conflicting \nmoral demands, options and cravings, with responsibility for actions landing back on \nher shoulders\u201d (1993: 31). Thus, in an organisational context, even ethically aware \nmanagers and organisations will find themselves inhabiting \u201cmoral mazes\u201d (Jackall \n1988), \u201cwhere individuals are confronted with a plethora of maps through the maze, \neach vying for attention, none of which is able to provide monologically reliable \nguides to the territories that they purport to represent\u201d (Clegg & Rhodes 2006: 5). It \nis, however, MacIntyre\u201fs particular contribution to identify the manipulative form that \nsuch a context, with no moral meta-narrative, leads to. \n \nMacIntyre continues from this point by arguing that moral philosophies often find \ntheir embodiment in particular characters (the emphasis is his) \u2013 \u201cthey are, so to \nspeak, the moral representatives of their culture and they are so because of the way in \nwhich moral and metaphysical ideas and theories assume through them an embodied \nexistence in the social world. Characters are the masks worn by moral philosophies\u201d \n 4 \n(MacIntyre 1985: 28).\n2\n While the character \u201cmorally legitimates a mode of social \nexistence\u201d (ibid.: 29) it is also the case that characters will not secure universal \nassent. On the contrary \u201cit is partly because they provide focal points for disagreement \nthat they are able to perform their defining task\u201d (ibid.: 31). And the particular \ncharacter that MacIntyre draws attention to as the embodiment of emotivism and, \nindeed, as \u201cthat dominant figure of the contemporary scene\u201d (ibid.: 74), is that of the \nManager.  \n \nThe managers to which MacIntyre refers exist inside bureaucratic organisations, each \nof which (business organisations of any form and government agencies alike) is \n\u201ccharacteristically engaged in a competitive struggle for scarce resources to put to the \nservice of its predetermined ends. It is therefore a central responsibility of managers \nto direct and redirect their organizations\u201f available resources, both human and non-\nhuman, as effectively as possible towards those ends\u201d (ibid.: 25). But this means that \n\u201cthe manager represents in his character [as the embodiment of emotivism] the \nobliteration of the distinction between manipulative and non-manipulative social \nrelations \u2026 The manager treats ends as given, as outside his scope; his concern is \nwith technique, with effectiveness in transforming raw materials into final products, \nunskilled labor into skilled labor, investment into profits\u201d (ibid.: 30). It will be \napparent that there are strong resonances between MacIntyre\u201fs description and the \nSpeer quotation with which this paper began. \n \nWhile this critique of management and bureaucratic organisations occurs in After \nVirtue, it forms only a part of a consistent line of argument. In an earlier article, for \nexample, MacIntyre makes similar points when he states that, \u201cin his capacity of \ncorporate executive, the manager not only has no need to take account of, but must not \ntake account of certain types of considerations which he might feel obliged to \nrecognize were he acting as parent, as consumer, or as citizen\u201d (MacIntyre 1979: 126, \nemphasis in original). Later, MacIntyre cites the example of power company \nexecutives unable to consider a reduction in the overall levels of power consumption \neven though, as parents and concerned citizens in other spheres of activity, they might \nwell regard this as desirable (MacIntyre 1999: 322) \u2013 an example of \n\u201ccompartmentalisation\u201d that we will consider further below. Hence, managers, in their \nrole as manager neither do nor \u201care able to engage in moral debate. They are seen by \n 5 \nthemselves, and by those who see them with the same eyes as their own, as \nuncontested figures, who purport to restrict themselves to the realms in which rational \nagreement is possible \u2013 that is, of course from their point of view to the realm of fact, \nthe realm of means, the realm of measurable effectiveness\u201d (MacIntyre 1985: 30). \n \nMacIntyre continues his critique of managers in After Virtue when he contends that \nmanagers are accepted as morally neutral characters who are skilled at being effective \nwhatever the ends may be. But he counters that effectiveness is not a morally neutral \nvalue and is instead inevitably linked with the manipulation of other human beings \ninto compliant patterns of behaviour. It is \u201cby appeal to such effectiveness in this \nrespect that the manager claims his authority within the manipulative mode\u201d (ibid.: \n74). The lack of any kind of critical concern with the ends of their activity, and the \nmorally questionable manipulation of human beings as a means of bringing about \nthose unquestioned ends might seem, in itself, to be a sufficiently strong and damning \ncritique to condemn management as not just amoral but as essentially immoral. \nHowever, MacIntyre has yet one more nail to drive into the coffin of the manager as \ncharacter. For \u201cthe claim that the manager makes to effectiveness [and hence to any \nkind of legitimate authority] rests of course on the further claim to possess a stock of \nknowledge by means of which organizations and social structures can be moulded \u2026 \nThere are thus two parts to the manager\u201fs claims to justified authority. One concerns \nthe existence of a domain of morally neutral fact about which the manager is to be \nexpert\u201d. The other concerns knowledge of \u201ca set of law-like generalizations which \nwould enable the manager to predict that, if an event or state of affairs of a certain \ntype were to occur or be brought about, some other event or state of affairs of some \nspecific kind would result\u201d (ibid.: 77).  \n \nFor this to be true, the manager would have to operate under conditions similar to \nthose that apply in the natural sciences where facts and cause-effect generalisations \nare, of course, entirely conventional.\n3\n  But via an extended discussion of fact, \nexplanation and expertise (ibid.: 79-87) in which, if there is to be a science of human \nbehaviour it \u201cmust be formulated in a vocabulary which omits all reference to \nintentions, purposes and reasons for action\u201d (ibid.: 83), so that facts which are not \nmorally neutral are presented as if they were, and in anticipation of an equally \nextended discussion of the character of generalizations in social science and their \n 6 \n(lack of) predictive power (ibid.: 88-106), MacIntyre concludes that \u201cthe salient fact \nabout those sciences is the absence of the discovery of any law-like generalizations \nwhatsoever\u201d (ibid.: 88).  \n \nThis sweeping critique of the lack of achievement in the social sciences, which \nMacIntyre explains in terms of four different sources of systematic unpredictability in \nhuman affairs (ibid.: 93-100),\n4\n is then followed by the application of the same critique \nto managers: \u201cThe expert\u201fs claim to status and reward is fatally undermined when we \nrecognise that he possesses no sound stock of law-like generalizations and when we \nrealise how weak the predictive power available to him is. The concept of managerial \neffectiveness is after all one more contemporary moral fiction and perhaps the most \nimportant of them all\u201d (ibid.: 106-7). Thus, \u201cthe realm of managerial expertise is one \nin which what purport to be objectively-grounded claims function in fact as \nexpressions of arbitrary, but disguised, will and preference\u201d (ibid.: 107), or in other \nwords, \u201ceffectiveness is part of a masquerade of social control rather than a reality\u201d \n(ibid.: 75), such that \u201cit is histrionic success which gives power and authority in our \nculture. The most effective bureaucrat is the best actor\u201d (ibid.: 107). And this \nconclusion takes us back to MacIntyre\u201fs earlier conclusion \u201cthat another moral fiction \n\u2013 and perhaps the most culturally powerful of them all \u2013 is embodied in the claims to \neffectiveness and hence to authority made by that central character of the modern \nsocial drama, the bureaucratic manager. To a disturbing extent our morality will be \ndisclosed as a theatre of illusions\u201d (ibid.: 76-7). \n \nIn MacIntyre\u201fs earlier article based on empirical work with power company \nexecutives (MacIntyre 1979 and see also MacIntyre 1977), although the criticism of \nmodernity is as strong, there does appear, however, to be some sympathy for \nmanagers who are, in a sense, locked inside such bureaucratic organisations and hence \ninto such pre-defined roles. MacIntyre makes the point that, \u201cevery society of course \nhas invited individuals to inhabit roles with different requirements. But difference has \nnot entailed the kind of separation, the kind of partitioning which is peculiar to \ncorporate modernity\u201d (MacIntyre 1979: 132).5  \n \n\u201cThe outcome\u201d, according to MacIntyre, \u201cis the creation of more than one self. The \nagent has to fabricate distinct characters\u201d and, \u201cin the modern corporate organization \n 7 \ncharacter has become more like a mask or a suit of clothing; an agent may have to \npossess more than one\u201d. Thus he argues that, \u201cwhen the executive shifts from the \nsphere of the family to that of the corporation he or she necessarily shifts moral \nperspective\u201d (ibid.: 127). Drawing again on the theatrical metaphor, MacIntyre adds \nthat he wants \u201cto insist on the importance of seeing contemporary life as a theatre with \na set of adjoining stages upon which a number of very different moral philosophical \ndramas are being acted out, the actors being required to switch from stage to stage, \nfrom character to character, often with astonishing rapidity\u201d (ibid.: 127-8). The \nmanager, we may infer, suffers more than most. \n \nThis, therefore, gives a sense of MacIntyre\u201fs concern for the effect of corporate \nmodernity on the people who actually inhabit the role of manager. To use Deetz\u201fs \nphrase, MacIntyre sees them as \u201ca kind of \u201ehomeless\u201f manager who is cut loose from \nany community\u201d (1995: 222) or, perhaps better, as \u201cdivided selves\u201d (Beadle 2002: \n48). Such division precludes one of the essential features of the moral agent, that of \nthe fixed and largely unchanging nature of character (MacIntyre 1979: 125), in which \n\u201cI have to understand myself as and to present myself to others as someone with an \nidentity other than the identities of role and office that I assume in each of the roles \nthat I occupy. I have to understand myself as someone who brings with her or himself \nto each role qualities of mind and character that belong to her or him qua individual \nand not qua role-player\u201d (MacIntyre 1999: 315). To avoid this potential for what we \nmight term moral stress, the virtues of integrity and constancy are required. Integrity \nrequires us to be the same person in each and every context, while constancy requires \nus to \u201cpursue the same goods through extended periods of time\u201d (ibid.: 317-8). \n \nThe problem is therefore one of \u201ccompartmentalisation\u201d, noted above. MacIntyre \nspeaks of two moral systems, that of the \u201cestablished social order with its assignment \nof roles and responsibilities\u201d (within which we may include that of manager in \nbureaucratic organisations), and by contrast \u201cthat developed within those milieus in \nwhich that assignment has been put to question\u201d, such milieus including \u201cthe \neveryday life of certain kinds of family and household, of certain kinds of workplace, \nof certain kinds of school and church, and of a variety of kinds of local community\u201d \n(ibid.: 318). This leads to compartmentalisation in which \u201ceach distinct sphere of \nsocial activity comes to have its own role structure governed by its own specific \n 8 \nnorms in relative independence of other such spheres. Within each sphere those norms \ndictate which kind of consideration are to be treated as relevant to decision-making \nand which are to be excluded\u201d (ibid.: 322). The manager is, on this view, caught by \ninhabiting at least two moral systems in one of which \u2013 in his or her role as manager \nwithin a bureaucratic organisation \u2013 he or she cannot engage in debate about ends and, \nbecause there are no morally neutral facts and no law-like generalizations on which to \ndraw, must use manipulative forms of social relations in order to achieve the given \nends by the most effective and efficient means available.  \n \nWe can summarise MacIntyre\u201fs characterisation of managers, then, in Beadle\u201fs \nhelpful words, as follows: \u201cFirst, that the character of the manger eschews any \nsubstantive notion of the good. Second, that the manager\u201fs role is to deploy \nsupposedly impersonal facts in pursuit of the most effective and efficient means to \nachieve any prescribed ends but that the sort of morally neutral knowledge required to \nachieve such manipulation does not exist. Third that management is one of the most \npowerful myths of the modern order and finally that managers themselves inhabit a \ndeep personal compartmentalisation without which their social role could not be \nunderstood\u201d (Beadle 2002: 45-6). \n \nWe are faced, then, with two issues. The first is to assess whether and to what extent \nMacIntyre is correct in his analysis and critique of corporate modernity and the \nposition of the manager within it. For it is probably apparent that MacIntyre makes \ncertain claims that go considerably deeper than those generally recognised in the \nmanagement ethics literature, claims that require not so much the resolving of the \nmorality of management, but, to use Parker\u201fs phrase (2002: 210) that we will come to \nbelow, its re-imagining. And this links to the second issue which, if MacIntyre is in \nany way correct, is to begin to construct an answer that, given the highly damning \nnature of his critique, does something other than simply amount to throwing up one\u201fs \nhands in horror, frustration or despair. It is to the first of these issues that we turn. \n \n \nII. The morality of management \u2013 tempering and up-dating MacIntyre\u2019s critique \n 9 \n \nIt may be helpful to analyse MacIntyre\u201fs critique of management in three stages. First, \nthere is an existing body of work which critiques MacIntyre directly. Second, it is also \nworth commenting on recent work on bureaucracy since, as we have seen, it is the \nbureaucratic organisation that provides the immediate context for MacIntyre\u201fs critique \nof the manager. Third we will, of course, need to review contemporary thinking on \nmanagement in business organisations. As noted above, we will restrict ourselves here \nto a consideration of management in business organisations operating under Anglo-\nAmerican capitalism, partly because this is where the main literature in this area \noriginates and partly because it is here that MacIntyre\u201fs critique is of particular \nrelevance. \n \nMacIntyre\u2019s critics \nThere are a number of writers who have responded directly to MacIntyre\u201fs critique. \nFrom these we can identify certain points of agreement and, not surprisingly, several \npoints of contention. On the positive side, Mangham\u201fs summary is instructive and is \nworth citing at length: \n \n\u201cThere appears to be a measure of support for some of MacIntyre\u201fs assertions: \nmanagers are central to our society (perhaps more central than the \ndistinguished philosopher thought); there is evidence that they treat others and \nare treated themselves as means rather than ends \u2013 that they manipulate and \nare manipulated; there is evidence that \u2013 at least at the time MacIntyre was \nwriting \u2013 some of them claim to be following law-like generalizations which \nwill enhance efficiency; there is evidence that they (or some who write, as it \nwere, on their behalf) claim moral neutrality for much of their action; there is \nevidence that the Manager separates his\/her self from his\/her professional role; \nand there is some evidence that when managers do indulge in moral argument \nthey may become confused and may experience stress. Some of this evidence \nis thin but, overall, MacIntyre does not appear to have been too far out in \nmaking his claims.\u201d (Mangham 1995: 195, emphasis in original) \n \nMangham\u201fs statement finds varying degrees of support in the work of Anthony \n(1986), Deetz (1995), du Gay (1998; 2000)\n6\n and Roberts (1984). On the other side, \n 10 \nhowever, there are various points of contention. The first is from Anthony (1986) who \nargues that MacIntyre (possibly through no fault of his own) has accepted a mistaken \naccount of management. Instead, Anthony argues, managerial authority must have a \nmoral foundation which \u201cis finally likely to rest upon a degree of public consensus as \nto the goods that management produces, upon, when the batteries of instrumental \ntechniques are set aside, what management is understood to be for\u201d (Anthony 1986: \n183), or, in other words, \u201c\u2026 the authority of management will derive from the \ncommunity\u201fs approval for what management does, for its ends\u201d (ibid.: 190). Anthony, \nin effect, suggests that there is no such thing as compartmentalisation and hence that \nall is well. However, this assumes that there is public consensus on the goods that \nmanagement produces and, particularly in relation to business organisations, it is far \nfrom clear that this is the case, as we shall discuss further below. \n \nThe second point of contention is to do with management and the means \/ end debate. \nRandels (1995: 205), in his response to Mangham, offers a less sympathetic critique \nof MacIntyre\u201fs views and suggests that his overall assessment of our current moral \ncondition is too pessimistic. His main point is that the manager MacIntyre \ncharacterises must represent at most managers in the middle or lower levels of the \ncorporate bureaucracy. \u201cExecutives, even if only at the upper level, can discuss what \nconstitutes good business, having fewer ends given\u201d (ibid.: 205-6). He cites various \nexamples of senior executives influencing the ends of their corporations, suggests that \nthe scope of MacIntyre\u201fs claim is even more limited because not all middle- and \nlower-level managers \u201care mere policy implementers\u201d (ibid.: 206) and that the \nlanguage of stakeholding (while in its infancy before the initial publication of After \nVirtue in 1981) and of the social responsibility of business in general, indicates that \nthe ends of business are by no means simply given.  \n \nIn effect, Randels\u201f challenge is to MacIntyre\u201fs notion of \u201cpredetermined ends\u201d, by \nquestioning who does the predetermining. And even if such predetermining occurs \noutside of the bureaucratic organisation (by government, shareholders, the financial \nmarkets or whoever), Randels questions whether it is not subject to any kind of debate \nas to the legitimacy and morality of those ends by those who represent the \norganisation itself. Do they simply accept the ends without question? Deetz (1995) \nsimilarly suggests that studies of organisations indicate a more complex story where \n 11 \nmanagers are clearly \u201cnot value-neutral or simply economically rational\u201d, and he \nfinds, in contrast to the Speer quote above, \u201clittle evidence to suggest value neutrality \nis popular or that the \u201echaracter of efficient technician\u201f is a compelling social image\u201d \n(ibid.: 219).  \n \nNash is similarly supportive of this position. She argues against what she terms the \n\u201creductionist nature\u201d of MacIntyre\u201fs characterisation: \u201cFew real managers are capable \nof the single-minded opportunism that characterizes the philosopher\u201fs manager \u2026 In \nreality, there are many managerial \u201etypes\u201f, and they display a variety of intellectual \nbiases and moral scruples\u201d (Nash 1995: 228). She also argues that few managers \nassume that their role is morally neutral \u2013 \u201cwe see any number of chief executives and \nfirst-line supervisors for whom the idea of work is the basis for entertaining a \ncommitment to a wide variety of duties towards others\u201d \u2013 what Nash has herself \ndescribed as a covenant approach (Nash 1990). She concludes, \u201cin arguing for a fuller \nunderstanding of moral meaning-making by managers (good and bad), I am not totally \ndenying there are strong forces for immorality or incoherency in the postmodern \npsyche and in the dynamics of organized business; but I am reluctant to see no \npotential for moral capacity in the Manager at all, i.e. accepting the demonic view of \nManager\u201d (Nash 1995: 231). \n \nThe point that is being made by Randels, Deetz and Nash is, of course, to do with \nmanagerial agency. Managers, as human beings, are moral agents and as such it is \nimpossible for them to compartmentalise their lives to such an extent that within \nbureaucratic organisations their own agency disappears entirely. Hine summarises this \nwell: \u201cMacIntyre\u201fs unsympathetic characterisation implies a determinism of \nmanagerial purpose and agency in the service of power\u201d (Hine 2007: 360). That said, \nwe will need to return below to the question of degree \u2013 to what extent are managers \nsovereign in relation to their own agency, or to what extent is such sovereignty \nconstrained by the bureaucratic context? However, we should acknowledge that what \nwe do find in the writings of Randels, Deetz and Nash is a more nuanced account of \nthe origin of ends than MacIntyre has himself provided. \n \nThe third point of contention is more sociological than organisational in nature and \nleads in to the discussion of bureaucratic organisations that follows. It derives from \n 12 \nNash\u201fs concern not to \u201clay the blame for our social ills solely at the feet of the \ncharacter of the manager\u201d (Nash 1995: 230). According to Deetz, the problem lies not \nwith the character of the manager but with the role that commercial corporations have \ninherited in society. In effect, he locates the problem not at the level of the role of \nmanager but at the level of a society which has allowed such organisations so \ndominant a position that even \u201chome and community to which MacIntyre would have \nmanagers reconnect are themselves thoroughly colonized and instrumentalized. They \ndepend upon corporate money, corporate goods and corporate stability. The meaning \nof life has often been reduced to the accumulation of goods \u2013 the only apparent certain \nthing in an uncertain world\u201d (Deetz 1995: 221).  \n \nThis, as we have seen in relation to MacIntyre\u201fs sympathy for managers who are \nlocked inside such bureaucratic organisations and hence into such pre-defined roles, is \nprecisely MacIntyre\u201fs own view. In After Virtue, in relation to the valuing of external \ngoods such as profit in economic institutions, MacIntyre bemoans the effect on virtue: \n\u201cWe should therefore expect that, if in a particular society the pursuit of external \ngoods were to become dominant, the concept of the virtues might suffer first attrition \nand then perhaps something near total effacement, although simulacra might abound\u201d \n(MacIntyre 1985: 196). He is similarly critical when he writes of modern capitalist \nsociety that, \u201cwhat constitutes success in life becomes a matter of the successful \nacquisition of consumer goods, and thereby that acquisitiveness which is so often a \ncharacter trait necessary for success in capital accumulation is further sanctioned. \nUnsurprisingly pleonexia, the drive to have more and more, becomes treated as a \ncentral virtue.\u201d (MacIntyre 1995: xiii). In other words, as we have already seen, \nMacIntyre\u201fs portrayal of the character of the manager is bound up with his criticism \nof modernity in general, and of contemporary consumer society and Anglo-American \ncapitalist business organisations in particular. And the solution must therefore have \nsomething to do with the environment within which such organisations operate. \n \nWe have various points, therefore, made in response to MacIntyre\u201fs underlying \ncritique of modernity and management, that we will need to carry forward. However, \none frustrating aspect of the work of MacIntyre\u201fs critics is that they offer little beyond \ncritique. In particular, with the exception to a limited extent of Anthony and du Gay, \n 13 \nnone of the critics have addressed themselves to the solution that MacIntyre has \nhimself identified, and to which we will turn in the third part of this paper. \n \nBureaucratic organisations \nWe need now, however, to give further consideration to the organisational focus of \nMacIntyre\u201fs critique \u2013 that of bureaucracy. We have seen that MacIntyre\u201fs critique is \nuniversally negative with respect to such organisational types and this for two reasons. \nOne is their effect on managerial agency; the second, at least in relation to capitalist \nbusiness organisations, is the ends that they pursue \u2013 ends of acquisitiveness, of \ncapital accumulation or, more generally as we shall see below, the prioritisation of \nexternal goods. Three aspects of bureaucracy concern us here. \n \nFirst, it might be argued that bureaucracy is irrelevant in relation to modern business \norganisations. As business has increasingly moved to what are referred to as market, \nnetwork or post-bureaucratic forms of organisation (Courpasson & Reed 2004; du \nGay 2004; Hodgson 2004; Salaman 2004), bureaucracy, it might seem, has been both \nvilified and abandoned. But this would be to over-simplify the position. In that a \ndistinction should be made between \u201ebureaucracy\u201f as a noun describing (generally) \npublic sector organisations designed for a particular purpose, and \u201ebureaucratic\u201f as an \nadjective describing a style of organising that any organisation might adopt (Hoggett \n2004: 168), it is the latter with which we are concerned. And it has been persuasively \nargued from DiMaggio and Powell (1983: 147) on, and empirically demonstrated \n(see, for example, Hodgson 2004; Karreman & Alvesson 2004), that all modern \norganisations, whether private sector business or otherwise, continue to contain \nelements of bureaucracy and maintain bureaucratic controls. Indeed, there is even \nevidence of re-bureaucratisation in organisations that have attempted to abandon it \n(Hodgson 2004). Hence, it is a question of more or less bureaucratisation (Kallinikos \n2004: 16) rather than whether it exists at all.  \n \nSecond, it is in the nature of organisations that maintain some element of bureaucratic \nform, with hierarchy and rule-bound behaviour as the key dimensions (Kallinikos \n2004: 16), that they necessarily subordinate the pursuit of individual goals to \norganisational ones (Hoggett 2004; Karreman & Alvesson 2004; Salaman 2004; ten \nBos & Willmott 2001). This is, of course, precisely the opposite of the managerial \n 14 \nagency that Randels, Deetz and Nash were arguing above. As Kallinikos (2004: 23) \nputs it, \u201cthe organizational involvement of individuals qua roles implies the \ndissociation of the process of organizing from the emotional and cognitive complexity \nof agents qua persons\u201d, such that, \u201cin one form or another depersonalized conduct has \nbeen made an indispensable principle of all formal organizing in modernity\u201d (ibid.: \n17).  \n \nThird, however, despite this subordination and depersonalisation, bureaucracy claims \nvalues of its own (du Gay 2004). So while bureaucracy can lead to depersonalisation \nand the stripping of users (of public services) of their humanity (Hoggett 2004: 180), \nit also promotes a certain selflessness to the ideals of public service. Thus, among the \nethical attributes of the \u201cgood bureaucrat\u201d du Gay (2000: 29) includes the \u201cabnegation \nof personal moral enthusiasms\u201d! But he also includes strict adherence to procedure, \nacceptance of hierarchical sub- and super-ordination and commitment to the purposes \nof the office as positive ethical values (ibid.: 29). The assumption here is that these are \nethical attributes for one of two reasons: either because the ends of the organisation \nare themselves ethical so that subordination to those ends is a good in itself; or \nbecause the ends are irreducibly plural and incommensurable and it is then not up to \nthe bureaucrat to determine between them but to cultivate a \u201ctrained indifference\u201d to \nthe discourse of \u201cultimate ends\u201d (ibid.: 31). Certainly, from the perspective of \nbusiness rather than public sector organisations, such an approach would appear to be \nan abdication of moral responsibility. \n \nDu Gay\u201fs claims for the morality of bureaucracy have some force, particularly where \nthe ends of the organisation are clearly seen to be good. But the broad conclusions \nthat we can draw from this discussion are that MacIntyre\u201fs critique of the lack of \nmanagerial agency in bureaucratic organisations continues to be relevant, and that \nbusiness organisations continue to exhibit such bureaucratic tendencies. \n \nContemporary thinking on management in business organisations  \nThe debate that MacIntyre initiated and the literature on bureaucracy have developed \nlargely in isolation from the mainstream management and management ethics \nliterature. Within this mainstream literature, however, several of the themes that we \nhave already identified above have also been discussed. So, for example, we find \n 15 \nmanagement\u201fs role in the means \/ end debate within Thomas\u201f work (2003) as well as \nwithin the stakeholder literature (Donaldson & Preston 1995; Phillips 2003; Phillips et \nal. 2003) although, like the literature on bureaucracy, stakeholder theory appears to \nabdicate responsibility for the choice of ultimate ends, leaving them to be worked out \namong the normative stakeholders (Phillips et al. 2003). \n \nAnother theme in the mainstream literature is concerned with the issue of managerial \nexpertise and a set of law-like generalizations with Thomas (2003) suggesting that \nthere still remain two views \u2013 those who argue that management is an objectively \nrational activity and those who view it as more subjective. Watson (2002) and Parker \n(2002) both express concern at the apparently increasing if not quite universal view \nthat managerialism as \u201ca generalized technology of control to everything \u2013 horses, \nhumans and hospitals\u201d (Parker 2002: 11) is taking over the world, and that this \ntechnology of control allows managers to drive organisations in the same way as \nengineers drive machines (Watson 2002: 53). Parker does not work through the \npractical implications of his alternative \u2013 that management could be replaced with co-\nordination and that co-ordinators should not necessarily be conceived of as a separate \ngroup or receive a higher status and rewards (Parker 2002: 206). Instead, he bemoans \nthe fact that, \u201cat the present time, management cannot be reimagined\u201d, but in its \nmanagerialist form only refused (ibid.: 210). While there seems to be no closure on \nthe debate between objectivity and subjectivity, it is at least possible to say that the \nexistence of a fairly common curriculum within business and management schools \ndoes indicate a body of knowledge that managers can draw on, even though this body \nof knowledge contains contested elements, and that this body of knowledge is being \nincreasingly applied in all kinds of organisations, both in the public and private \nsectors. Hence, MacIntyre\u201fs claim concerning the lack of managerial expertise is, at \nthe very least, contested, although there does seem to be more general agreement that \na set of law-like generalisations that managers can simply apply in any and every \nsituation does not exist. \n \nJust as pertinently for our purposes, managerial agency, and an associated \nclassification into moral, amoral and immoral management, have also been a recurring \ntheme in the mainstream literature (Bird & Waters 1989; Carroll 1987, 2000; Hine \n2007; Ogbonna & Wilkinson 2003; ten Bos & Willmott 2001; Watson 2002). One \n 16 \nconsistent concern has been that while managerial acts cannot be morally neutral \n\u201cbecause every such act occurs in the context of relationships in which there is, at the \nvery least, a potential for exploitation\u201d (Watson 2002: 448), in practice managers \neither do not or cannot express such moral sentiments. Bird & Waters (1989) may \nhave been the first to identify the \u201cmoral muteness of managers\u201d in practice, and the \nmoral stress they potentially experience as a result, but others have confirmed these \nsame issues (Hine 2007; Ogbonna & Wilkinson 2003; ten Bos & Willmott 2001). The \nstruggle for managers to maintain their agency, therefore, continues (ten Bos & \nWillmott 2001: 788). \n \nThe interesting point about the most recent literature in this area, however, is that, if \nanything, managerial agency is seen to be weakening in the light of increased \norganisational control. In effect, the struggle is between managerial agency on the one \nhand and agency theory on the other, in which managerial agency is deliberately \ncurtailed in the interests of the organisation. Studies in financial capitalism and \ncorporate governance (Froud et al. 2002; O\u201fSullivan 2003; Williams 2000) point to \nthe increasingly important role of the financial markets which no longer act as simple \nintermediaries between household savers and investing firms but \u201cact dynamically to \nshape the behaviour of both firms and households\u201d (Froud et al. 2002: 120). There is, \nhowever, a key difference between UK and US, on the one hand, and French and \nGerman versions of capitalism, on the other, in this respect (O\u201fSullivan 2003; \nThompson 2003; Williams 2000). While there is some evidence of convergence of \nthese two versions of capitalism, the former generally operates a \u201cdownsize and \ndistribute\u201d strategy compared with the latter\u201fs \u201cretain and invest\u201d strategy (Williams \n2000: 4) and there is a consequent pressure on management under Anglo-American \ncapitalism to deliver results, a pressure which is reinforced by an active market for \ncorporate control. Hine, for example, cites a manager who simply stated that, \n\u201cdecisions need to be made in the best interests of the business, not your own \npreferences, or those of some vested interest within the organisation\u201d and comments \nthat this implies \u201can instrumental rationality in pursuit of commercial objectives\u201d \n(2007: 363). \n \nThompson (2003) argues that this is preventing the bargain between employees and \nemployers (in which employees took \u201ca share in the responsibility for the business \n 17 \nsuccess and competitiveness of the firm in return for companies taking responsibility \nfor informing, involving and above all insulating (core) employees from the vagaries \nof the market\u201d (ibid.: 364)) from being kept. This leads to what Thompson refers to as \n\u201cdisconnected capitalism\u201d. As corporate governance systems are strengthened to \nreinforce shareholder value (O\u201fSullivan 2003), so it seems that the agency of \nmanagers reduces. And as this agency reduces, the public consensus on the goods that \nmanagement produces (Anthony\u201fs claim above for the morality of management) also \nseems to become more fragile, particularly as far as employees are concerned. \nSennett\u201fs work (1998 and see also Moore 2005a) similarly reinforces this point. \n \nWhere does this summary of MacIntyre\u201fs critics, of bureaucracy and of the current \nsituation with regards to the role and morality of management leave us in respect of \nMacIntyre\u201fs critique? While it is clear that many of the issues that MacIntyre \nidentified need some degree of tempering, it also seems clear that the basic tenets of \nhis position, at least in respect of managers in business organisations under Anglo-\nAmerican capitalism, remain in place. While managerial agency, at least in respect of \nwhich organisation to join in the first place and, to a lesser extent, whether \nsubsequently to exit, may be intact, managerial agency within the business \norganisation is highly constrained, if not completely contained as MacIntyre argued. \nSuch business organisations maintain sufficient characteristics of the bureaucratic \nform for MacIntyre\u201fs critique (but also his slight sympathy for managers working \nwithin them) also to remain intact. And the increasing financialisation of the \neconomies within which these business organisations operate indicates an ultimate \nend purpose for these organisations which is based purely on financial return and \nshareholder value, so embedding pleonexia, (\u201cthe drive to have more and more\u201d) as a \ncentral virtue (MacIntyre 1995: xiii cited above and see also Moore 2005a). The ends, \ntherefore, are to a large extent predetermined and the public consensus on the goods \nthat management produces, particularly so far as employees are concerned, does not \nseem to exist. \n \nIn the light of this, we turn now to a possible solution and one that, as noted above, is \nperhaps paradoxically based on MacIntyre\u201fs own work. \n \n \n 18 \nIII. MacIntyre\u2019s virtues-goods-practice-institution schema \n \nGoods, practices and institutions \nThe significance of MacIntyre\u201fs work in general and its application to contemporary \norganisations has been addressed elsewhere (Beadle & Moore 2006). From this it is \nclear that MacIntyre\u201fs arguments for and developments of virtue ethics, and their \napplication specifically to the area of business, are already well documented and have \nreceived critical review (see Beadle 2002; Moore 2002, 2005a, 2005b; Moore & \nBeadle 2006, for example). What follows is, therefore, a succinct summary of the key \naspects of MacIntyre\u201fs schema as it relates to the issue addressed in this paper.  \n \nWe begin by returning to MacIntyre\u201fs oft-quoted definition of a practice. A practice \nis: \n \n\u201c[a]ny coherent and complex form of socially established cooperative human \nactivity through which goods internal to that form of activity are realized in \nthe course of trying to achieve those standards of excellence which are \nappropriate to, and partially definitive of, that form of activity, with the result \nthat human powers to achieve excellence, and human conceptions of the ends \nand goods involved, are systematically extended.\u201d (MacIntyre 1985: 187) \n \nIt is axiomatic in MacIntyre\u201fs schema, and a point to which we will need to return, \nthat only those who participate in the practice can understand and therefore gain the \ninternal goods that the practice affords. This is one reason why MacIntyre terms them \ninternal goods \u2013 \u201cbecause they can only be identified and recognized by the \nexperience of participating in the practice in question. Those who lack the relevant \nexperience are incompetent thereby as judges of internal goods\u201d (ibid.: 188-9). This is \nnot to say that those who are the beneficiaries of the outputs of the practice \u2013 in our \ncase the consumers who purchase them \u2013 may not be excellent judges of such output, \nnor that they do, in some sense at least, determine the standards of excellence in the \npractice (see Keat 2000: 128-9). But unless they have themselves been practitioners \nthey will be unable to appreciate or gain the internal goods of the practice.\n7\n \n \n 19 \nInternal goods derived from practices, both the excellence of the products or services \nthat result and the perfection of the individual in the process (ibid.: 189-90 and see \nalso MacIntyre 1994: 284 and further below), can be contrasted with external goods \nsuch as survival, reputation, power, profit or, more generally, success, and we have \nalready noted MacIntyre\u201fs prediction of the effects on the virtues if, in a particular \nsociety, the pursuit of such goods were to become dominant. In order for internal \ngoods to be realised it is clear that practices need to flourish, but to do so they require \ninstitutions to provide for their sustenance:  \n \n\u201cInstitutions are characteristically and necessarily concerned with ... external \ngoods. They are involved in acquiring money and other material goods; they \nare structured in terms of power and status, and they distribute money, power \nand status as rewards. Nor could they do otherwise if they are to sustain not \nonly themselves, but also the practices of which they are the bearers. For no \npractices can survive for any length of time unsustained by institutions. Indeed \nso intimate is the relationship of practices to institutions \u2013 and consequently of \nthe goods external to the goods internal to the practices in question \u2013 that \ninstitutions and practices characteristically form a single causal order in which \nthe ideals and the creativity of the practice are always vulnerable to the \nacquisitiveness of the institution, in which the cooperative care for common \ngoods of the practice is always vulnerable to the competitiveness of the \ninstitution. In this context the essential feature of the virtues is clear. Without \nthem, without justice, courage and truthfulness, practices could not resist the \ncorrupting power of institutions.\u201d (MacIntyre 1985: 194) \n \nMacIntyre\u201fs description of institutions and their relationship with practices can be \napplied in almost any context. MacIntyre himself indicates that, \u201cthe range of \npractices is wide: arts, sciences, games, politics in the Aristotelian sense, the making \nand sustaining of family life, all fall under the concept\u201d (ibid.: 188). The argument \nhere is that this can be extended to include organisational life in general and business \norganisations in particular. But the essential association and tension between practices \nand institutions, and between internal and external goods, clearly gives the texture of \norganisational life a central dilemma, a dilemma which is explored further below.  \n \n 20 \nWe can legitimately extend MacIntyre\u201fs notion of what he refers to as \u201cproductive \ncrafts\u201d (MacIntyre 1994: 284) to business organisations in general by noting that at \nthe core of any such organisation (and organisations in general) there is a practice. \nThe particular practice may be fishing, or producing beef or milk, or building houses, \nor it may be providing financial services or mining or retailing.  The entirely common \nfeature, however, is that all such activities fall within MacIntyre\u201fs definition of a \npractice as \u201cany coherent and complex form of socially established cooperative \nhuman activity\u201d.8 \n \nFurthermore, it follows that individuals would do well to view themselves as \ncraftspersons and their work in business organisations as set in the context of a \npractice. This would be only one of a number of practices in which they engage, but is \nno less important than any other practice \u2013 indeed, quite possibly more important \ngiven the amount of time and energy, physical and emotional, expended there. If they \nendeavour to maintain an integrity of character by exercising the virtues, here as \nelsewhere, gaining such internal goods as are available, then not only would the \nindividuals benefit \u2013 be \u201cperfected through and in her or his activity\u201d (MacIntyre \n1994: 284) \u2013 but they would, in the very act of doing all of this, play a necessary part \nin the humanising of business from within.\n9\n  But what is it that enables the individual \nin a business organisation, the craftsperson, to seek and realise such perfection, or \nindeed to have that aim frustrated? To answer this question requires further \ncommentary on MacIntyre\u201fs notion of virtue and its relationship to goods, practices \nand institutions. \n \nVirtues and institutional governance \nMacIntyre links virtues, goods and practices specifically: \n \u201cA virtue is an acquired human quality the possession and exercise of which tends \nto enable us to achieve those goods which are internal to practices and the lack of \nwhich effectively prevents us from achieving any such goods.\u201d (MacIntyre 1985: \n191) \nVirtues, therefore, as enduring character traits, are not practice-specific, but are \nexercised in each of the practices in which an individual engages and are necessary to \nthe flourishing of each such practice. The virtues enable the individual to achieve the \n 21 \ngoods internal to practices, and the achievement of those goods across a variety of \npractices and over time is instrumental in the individual\u201fs search for and movement \n(their narrative quest) towards their own telos.  \n \nBut we now need to consider a further aspect of MacIntyre\u201fs schema and one which is \nparticularly important to the argument here concerning the morality of management. \nMacIntyre argues that: \n \n\u201cthe making and sustaining of forms of human community \u2013 and therefore of \ninstitutions \u2013 itself has all the characteristics of a practice, and moreover of a \npractice which stands in a peculiarly close relationship to the exercise of the \nvirtues \u2026 For the ability of a practice to retain its integrity will depend on the \nway in which virtues can be and are exercised in sustaining the institutional \nforms which are the social bearers of the practice\u201d (MacIntyre 1985: 194-5, \nemphasis added).  \n \nIn other words, there is a second practice involved in any practice-institution \ncombination \u2013 the practice of making and sustaining the institution. And it is clear that \nmanagement will be particularly concerned with this second practice \u2013 although a \nfuller consideration of this point is reserved to a later discussion.\n10\n With this piece of \nMacIntyre\u201fs schema in place, however, we can now return to the central dilemma of \nhis schema \u2013 the tension between the practice and the institution, despite them \nforming \u201ca single causal order\u201d. MacIntyre notes that, \u201cpractices are often distorted by \ntheir modes of institutionalisation, when irrelevant considerations relating to money, \npower and status are allowed to invade the practice\u201d (MacIntyre 1994: 289). The \npoint, therefore, is that aside from individuals\u201f own virtuous character (or otherwise), \nthe mode of institutionalisation and the extent to which it mistakenly prioritises \nexternal goods, is fundamental to enabling craftspersons to seek and realise perfection \nin their practice, or indeed to have that aim frustrated. Thus an important part of the \nwhole virtues-goods-practice-institution schema is to focus on the institution in order \nto assess what features of the institution will better enable it not to distort the practice \nthat it houses.  \n \n 22 \nThe character of the virtuous institution \nEvidence from a variety of studies (Akaah and Riordan 1989; Baumhart 1961; \nBrenner and Molander 1977, for example) highlights the importance of peer and \nsuperior influence on the ethical behaviour of managers. Weaver summarises this \nwell: \u201cIn actual, everyday organizations, key to the development of virtuous and \nvicious identities in organizations will be factors such as leaders\u201f behaviour, peer and \ngroup behaviour, and the embedded cultural norms of an organization\u201d (2006: 352), \nbut he also points to a related danger that, \u201cthis can also lead to role transference, in \nwhich actors who positionally represent the organization (e.g. top-level management) \nare assumed to possess moral identity and to exercise moral agency on behalf of all in \nthe organization, so that lower-level members think and act as though moral agency is \nnot their responsibility\u201d (ibid.: 352).  \n \nIt has been argued (Klein 1988 and Moore 2005b) that an appropriate way of \nconceptualising this is to think not just in terms of particular individuals and their \nexercise (or not) of the virtues at the institutional level, as MacIntyre does, but also in \nterms of institutional level virtues (and vices), and hence of institutional character. \nJust as MacIntyre talks of the concern for external goods and the acquisitiveness and \ncompetitiveness of the institution, it seems perfectly possible, by way of analogy or \nprojection (Goodpaster & Matthews 1982: 135), or by way of metaphor (Morgan \n1997: 4-8 and passim), to speak of the institution as having a virtuous or vicious \ncharacter, or a character that is somewhere between these two extremes. Klein \ncomments that, \u201cformal organizations can function like a moral person \u2026 they \npotentially have something analogous to character, which can be evaluated as virtuous \nor vicious\u201d (Klein 1988: 56). \n \nA virtuous institutional character, then, might be defined as the seat of the virtues \nnecessary for an institution to engage in practices with excellence, focusing on those \ninternal goods thereby obtainable, while warding off threats from its own inordinate \npursuit of external goods and from the corrupting power of other institutions in its \nenvironment with which it engages (see Moore 2005b: 661). This is not to say that \nsome institutions in the organisation\u201fs environment may not exercise a positive effect \non the institution \u2013 a point to which we will return below. But in essence this \napproach separates out organisational culture (and its association with values) as \n 23 \nessentially institutionally-oriented and therefore primarily a means to the end of \nexternal goods, from institutional character (and its association with virtues) which is \npractice-oriented and thereby a means to the end of internal goods (ibid.: 668). \n \nTaking business organisations as a particular form of practice-institution combination \n(a form which MacIntyre, as we have seen, terms \u201cproductive crafts\u201d) and drawing \nfrom the definition of virtuous institutional character given above, the concept of the \nvirtuous business organisation can be developed further. The first requirement of a \nbusiness organisation with a virtuous character would be that there is a good \npurpose\n11\n for the particular practice-institution combination that it comprises. Second, \nthe institution would be aware that it is founded on and has as its most important \nfunction the sustenance of the particular business practice that it houses and \nfollowing from this, the organisation would encourage the pursuit of excellence in \nthat practice whatever that may mean for the particular practice in question. Third, it \nwould focus on external goods (such as survival, profit and reputation) as both a \nnecessary and worthwhile function of the organisation (they are goods, not bads), but \nonly to the extent necessary to the sustenance and development of the practice. \nFourth, the organisation would be such as to be able to resist the corrupting power of \norganisations in its environment with which it in turn relates, such as competitors, \nsuppliers or those which represent the financial market, where these encourage a \nsingle-minded concentration on external goods. \n \nA virtuous organisation would also embody a number of other features (Moore \n2005b). These are the development of a power-balanced structure that will ensure that \nthe views and desires of particular constituencies are not privileged over those of \nothers, and decision-making systems and processes that enable rational critical \ndialogue having the effect of countering biases and enabling the questioning of the \nhitherto unquestioned. In particular, these will allow the organisation not to see itself \nas compartmentalised from other institutions in society but as one part of a larger \nwhole. While to some extent outside of its control, the encouragement of a supportive \nculture, as defined above with its focus on external goods, will also be a feature of the \ncharacter of a virtuous business organisation.\n \n \n 24 \nBut under which kinds of circumstance, would such business organisations be \npossible, or even flourish? \nPreconditions for virtuous business organisations \nAccording to MacIntyre: \n \n \u201cThe integrity of a practice causally requires the exercise of the virtues by at \nleast some of the individuals who embody it in their activities; and conversely \nthe corruption of institutions is always in part at least an effect of the vices.\u201d \n(MacIntyre 1985: 195) \n \nThe first precondition for a virtuous business organisation, then, is the presence of \nvirtuous agents at the level of both the core practice and the institution, for without \nagents who possess and exercise the virtues the core practice itself would no longer be \nfostered internally through the pursuit of excellence, and at the institutional level the \ncorruption of the institution and the consequent distortion of the practice would seem \nto be inevitable. This is particularly the case for those agents who hold decision-\nmaking authority in the institution. But the presence of such agents at both practice \nand institutional level is clearly insufficient to guarantee the presence of \norganisational virtue. \n \nThe second precondition for a virtuous business organisation is the mode of \ninstitutionalisation (MacIntyre 1994: 289, cited above) which distributes both \ndecision-making authority and decision criteria within institutions. In other words, we \nwould expect that different institutional forms will support to different extents the \ncore practices which they house, and thereby enable the exercise of the virtues and the \nattainment of internal goods to a greater or lesser degree. Weaver makes this point \nwell and links it back to the moral agency of individuals: \u201c\u2026 organizations \nthemselves \u2013 and the way they normalise and reproduce virtue or vice \u2013 become the \nprimary influence on the moral identity of their employees, and thus on the degree of \nvirtue characterizing those employees\u201d (2006: 356). \n \nThe third precondition for a virtuous business organisation is a conducive \nenvironment. It is clear that MacIntyre regards organisations as open systems that are \n 25 \nboth affected by other institutions in society and are capable (in both positive and \nnegative ways) of compartmentalising themselves from them. It is apparent therefore \nthat a particularly significant factor in any organisation\u201fs ability to maintain and \nexercise the virtues and support the core practice it houses is the extent to which the \nenvironment is more or less conducive to such activity, and we would expect that an \nunconducive environment would be problematic for organisational virtue. And, as \nnoted above, a conducive environment will be one with institutions that encourage \nvirtue by not prioritising external goods, but allow and even encourage the virtuous \nbusiness organisation to focus on the practice. \n \nThis suggests that, while a conducive environment is clearly beneficial to \norganisational virtue, it may be possible for organisations to resist their environment, \nor potentially to create around themselves a more conducive environment than most \norganisations experience. Moore & Beadle (2006) give the example of Traidcraft plc, \n(the UK\u201fs leading Fair Trade organisation) and its ability, in effect, to create around \nitself a micro-climate, (consisting particularly of shareholders, Fair Trader customers \nand developing country suppliers all of which prioritise the internal goods of the \npractice over external goods), within which organisational virtue could indeed \nflourish. Weaver, again, summarises this well: \u201cSo it is necessary for policy makers to \npay attention to how larger, macrocultural forces advance or inhibit the development \nof moral identity in organizations. But managers of organizations need to recognize \ntheir responsibility for influencing the larger macrocultural setting, so as to make it \nmore hospitable to organizations that welcome moral identity and moral agency. In \nvirtue-oriented theories, moral agents are responsible for choosing and changing the \norganizational situations in which moral identity either thrives or dies\u201d (2006: 361). \n \n \nIV. The role of management and the morality of management within MacIntyre\u2019s \nschema \n \nIt is, I hope, clear from all that has been said that management can be located within \nMacIntyre\u201fs schema. But it is important that we clarify exactly where it is located \nbefore drawing out the implications for both management practice and the morality of \nmanagement. There have been previous attempts to classify management as a \n 26 \npractice, on MacIntyre\u201fs definition, in its own right (Brewer 1997; McCann & \nBrownsberger 1990). However, one suspects that this would obtain a similar response \nfrom MacIntyre as he gave when asked whether teaching was a practice: \n \n\u201cteaching itself is not a practice, but a set of skills and habits put to the service \nof a variety of practices. The teacher should think of her or himself as a \nmathematician, a reader of poetry, an historian or whatever, engaged in \ncommunicating craft and knowledge to apprentices (MacIntyre and Dunne \n2002: 5) \u2026 It is part of my claim that teaching is never more than a means, \nthat it has no point and purpose except for the point and purpose of the \nactivities to which it introduces students. All teaching is for the sake of \nsomething else and so teaching does not have its own goods. The life of a \nteacher is therefore not a specific kind of life.\u201d (ibid.: 9) \n \nWhile this enraged educational philosophers at the time, and has led to continued and \nanimated debate (see Dunne & Hogan 2004), the point here is that management is \nequally not a practice in and of itself, but that, just as teachers are teachers of \nsomething (mathematics, literature, history), so managers are managers of something \u2013 \nthe practice at the core of the practice-institution combination \u2013 and are also engaged \nin the separate but related practice of making and sustaining the institution that houses \nthis core practice.\n12\n This might disappoint managers, though it should also be pointed \nout that, as we established above, there is a generic body of knowledge that managers \ncan draw on. This generic body of knowledge concerns, on this understanding, the \npractice of making and sustaining institutions \u2013 the body of knowledge forms the core \nof the craft into which such practitioners (managers) need to be apprenticed. But that \nthis knowledge needs to be applied specifically to the practice-institution combination \nin question and can never be abstracted entirely from its context should also be clear. \nIt may be helpful to depict this as follows: \n 27 \n \n \n \nThe point is that, on MacIntyre\u201fs schema, all those who are engaged in any level of \nmanagement\n13\n have two practices with which they must concern themselves. First-line \nsupervisors, as the most junior level of management, are, of course, mostly involved \nin the core practice and have only a small involvement in the institutional practice. \nBut they do have some involvement \u2013 by definition they are also engaged in the \npractice of making and sustaining the institution even if only to a limited extent. And \ncorrespondingly, senior management at the other end of the spectrum, while mainly \ninvolved in the institutional practice, should never forget that they also have an \ninvolvement in the practice at the core. An essential element of management at any \nlevel, then, is to understand and maintain an involvement with the core practice \u2013 to \nappreciate and indeed gain, at least to some extent, its internal goods. But in addition, \nwithin the practice of making and sustaining the institution, managers should equally \nbe concerned with the exercise of the virtues, with the pursuit of excellence and, in the \nsame way, should thereby receive the internal goods available. \n \nWith this in place, we are now in a position to return to a number of the issues that we \nidentified earlier in our attempt to re-imagine management and hence locate and give \nsubstantive content to its morality. The first point we need to return to is that of the \nmeans-end debate. And it is clear from the above that there is a requirement on all \nmanagers, but particularly those at the senior level, to ensure that the particular \norganisation with which they are concerned has a good purpose. In other words, while \nCore practice \nInstitutional practice \nIncreasing level of management  \nIncreasing concern with ends \nDecreasing concern with means  \n \n 28 \nMacIntyre\u201fs view was that ends are already given, we need to acknowledge the \nargument, supported with evidence from practice, that Randels, Deetz and Nash \nproduced and agree that managers should never confine themselves to a consideration \nonly of means to achieve predetermined ends, but must constantly consider and, if \nnecessary, challenge the ends for which the organisation is established. This may be \nparticularly difficult for those engaged in areas of business such as tobacco or the \narms trade, where making the moral case is clearly problematic. \n \nThe second point is that managers should be primarily concerned with the practice at \nthe core of the practice-institution combination, both to ensure its sustenance and to \nencourage it in its pursuit of excellence. That this will require managers at all levels to \nunderstand the practice at its core should be evident and this may be particularly \nchallenging for those who transfer from one industry to another. A rapid \napprenticeship in the core practice will then be required.\n14\n It will also be a challenge \nto those involved in holding companies which, in effect, buy and sell practice-\ninstitution combinations without necessarily paying much, if any, attention to the \nnature of the core practice. The pursuit of excellence in the core practice will, of \ncourse, enable those primarily engaged in it (all of whom are craftspeople) to attain \nthe internal goods available, so helping them on their narrative quest towards their \nown telos, such that there is not only a good product or service but that the \ncraftsperson is \u201cperfected through and in her or his activity\u201d.  \n \nIn order to ensure the maintenance of and pursuit of excellence in the core practice, \nmanagers must, thirdly, pay sufficient attention to external goods but, as we identified \nearlier, only to the extent that this is necessary. In other words, the pursuit of external \ngoods for themselves should not be the primary concern of managers. Getting the \nbalance right \u2013 pursuing sufficient external goods but not prioritising them \u2013 is clearly \na challenging assignment and one in which the virtues of phronesis (practical \njudgment) together with courage to resist those institutions, particularly those in the \nexternal environment which may seek to enforce a single-minded concentration on \nexternal goods, will be particularly necessary. \n \nThis, then, leads to a fourth point which is that one of the primary responsibilities for \nmanagers is to establish and maintain the character of the organisation. This was \n 29 \ndefined above as the seat of the virtues necessary for an institution to engage in \npractices with excellence and, in line with Weaver cited above, recognises that, \u201c\u2026 \norganizations themselves \u2013 and the way they normalise and reproduce virtue or vice \u2013 \nbecome the primary influence on the moral identity of their employees, and thus on \nthe degree of virtue characterizing those employees\u201d (2006: 356). \n \nOrganisational character is linked to the mode of institutionalisation. We noted earlier \nthat different modes of institutionalisation and the extent to which they prioritise \nexternal goods would have a direct effect on the ability to sustain and encourage \nexcellence in the core practice. Moore (2005a: 240) identified examples of such senior \nmanagers that took their organisations into or out of public ownership and their \nconcerns over the effect of the financial markets on the organisations\u201f values. (More \nrecent concern over the burgeoning \u201cprivate equity\u201d industry, however, may suggest \nthat there are advantages to public ownership, particularly to the transparency which \ncapital markets require \u2013 see, for example, Thornton (2007).) Moore & Beadle (2006: \n381-4), by contrast, highlight the particular mode of institutionalisation that Traidcraft \nplc has adopted and show how this is supportive of organisational virtue. That \nmanagers, then, and particularly senior managers, have a responsibility to determine \nthe mode of institutionalisation of their organisations is clear and is the fifth point in \nrelation to the role of managers. This will also involve ensuring the other features that \nwe noted earlier \u2013 a power-balanced structure, systems and processes that enable \nrational critical dialogue and a supportive culture \u2013 are enabled. \n \nIt was noted above that one of the other preconditions for virtuous organisations is the \npresence of virtuous agents at both the core practice and institution levels. And it is \nclearly management\u201fs responsibility to ensure that such agents are recruited in the \nfirst place and then nurtured. This might well pose something of a challenge to \nmethods of recruitment and selection which tend to focus on knowledge, skills and \nabilities together with an emphasis on personality rather than character \u2013 see, for \nexample, Robertson and Smith (2001). Where character is assessed in the selection \nprocess it seems often to be reduced to Organisational Citizenship Behaviour (though \nsee also Hodson (1999) for the concept of Management Citizenship Behaviour). \nAlthough such aspects are clearly important, particularly given the emphasis here on \nexcellence in the practice, character assessment and development in employees is the \n 30 \nsixth point in relation to the role of managers. Like many of the points developed \nhere, there is an element of \u201echicken and egg\u201f associated with this, and it is likely to \nbe easier for those organisations that are already virtuous to attract and develop \nvirtuous employees. For an organisation that judges itself to be far from virtuous but \nwishes to move in that direction, recruitment and development of virtuous employees \nmay well be both particularly necessary and particularly challenging. \n \nThe seventh and final point is that there is the related requirement, again particularly \nof senior managers, to attempt to produce a conducive environment within which \norganisational virtue can flourish. That the environment cannot just be considered as \na given, a factor within which managers have to work but cannot influence, should be \nclear from the earlier discussion and this accepts the critique of MacIntyre made by \nNash and Deetz, that the context for management is important and not all of the blame \ncan be laid at the manager\u201fs door. It may, however, be possible for managers to \ninfluence their environment and while this is partially to do with choice in the mode \nof institutionalisation, it is also a more general requirement on managers \u201cfor \nchoosing and changing the organizational situations in which moral identity either \nthrives or dies\u201d (Weaver 2006: 361, cited above). \n \n \nConclusion \n \nWhere does this leave the morality of management? Are managers simply the \nmorally-neutral efficient achievers of predetermined ends? Clearly, on this account, \nthe answer is no. For on this account there is considerable potential for the morality of \nmanagement to become established. The manipulative mode in which managers were \nsaid to operate is no longer necessarily the case. In determining (or at least taking part \nin the determination of or in the questioning of) ends, managers regain an essential \npart of their agency. By focussing on the core practice, ensuring its sustenance and \npursuit of excellence, managers move from manipulators to participants. Might this, \nin the process, relieve the moral stress that managers experience? Certainly it should, \nsince morality is then a central concern of managers and moral muteness should no \nlonger be a problem to anything like the same extent. In the process, Parker\u201fs \nconcerns \u2013 that management should not necessarily be accorded special status or \n 31 \nrewards and that management might be better conceived as a co-ordinating \nmechanism \u2013 might also be addressed.15 \n \nManagers, by re-imagining their role in this way, would be participating in two \npractices (amongst others that their de-compartmentalised lives would consist of). As \nmanagers become more senior, their concern comes to be increasingly with the \npractice of making and sustaining the institution, and the pursuit of excellence in this \npractice should be just as demanding and just as rewarding as the pursuit of \nexcellence in the core practice. In other words, those who have, in one sense, \noutgrown the core practice and now represent the institution that houses it, also have \nthe same opportunity to exercise the virtues in the making and sustaining of the \ninstitution, and thereby have the same opportunity to attain the relevant internal goods \nenabling them on their own narrative quest towards their own telos. The exercise of \nthe virtues is appropriate at this level also. \n \nIt will also be clear from all of this that management is an art, not a science, and that, \nwhile there is a whole series of guidelines for effective practice in the making and \nsustaining of institutions \u2013 a generic body of knowledge applicable at the institutional \nlevel \u2013 it does not possess a set of law-like generalizations. Managers must learn their \ncraft in exactly the same way as other trades and professions, and their craft will have \nboth generic elements applicable to any institution and specific elements applicable to \nthat particular institution and to that particular core practice. \n \nI have argued that the morality of management is particularly problematic in business \norganisations operating under Anglo-American capitalism. And while the conceptual \nframework that I have developed has been applied specifically to these types of \norganisation to resolve the issue of the morality of management by re-imagining \nmanagement itself, I would propose that the conceptual framework is generically \napplicable to all types of organisation. I have not been able to comment on the \npossibility that there may be other such organisations (perhaps in the public or \nvoluntary sectors, business organisations operating under other forms of capitalism \n(see Keat 2008), co-operatives and so on) that are already operating, in effect, within \nthis conceptual framework and in which the amorality or immorality of management \nis not at issue. However, to the extent that such organisations display characteristics \n 32 \nsimilar to business organisations under Anglo-American capitalism \u2013 predetermined \nends, unwarranted limitations on managerial agency, an unbalanced focus on external \ngoods \u2013 one would predict that the issue of the morality of management is similarly \nproblematic and that the solution identified here is similarly applicable. \n \nAnd Speer, where does this leave the Speers of this world \u2013 \u201cthe pure technician, the \nclassless bright young man without background, with no other original aim than to \nmake his way in the world and no other means than his technical and managerial \nability\u201d? In whichever type of organisation the Speers of this world may appear, \nperhaps, with this understanding, we may even be able to re-educate them to become \ntruly moral managers. \n \nNotes \nI would like to thank participants at the European Business Ethics Network-UK Association\u201fs 2004 \nconference, the Society for Business Ethics\u201f 2005 conference, the Alasdair MacIntyre\u201fs Revolutionary \nAristotelianism: Ethics, Resistance and Utopia conference in 2007, Gary Weaver and three anonymous \nreviewers for comments on previous versions of this paper, together with Ron Beadle for our joint \nwork which has informed this paper. \n1. I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer for pointing out that, unlike Adolf Eichmann (see Arendt \n1963), Speer was not hanged when the allies had him in their power \u2013 probably the highest ranking \nNazi who was not hanged or condemned to death in absentia. The difference between Eichmann and \nSpeer was that while Eichmann came to be at the very heart of the Nazi machinery of death, Speer \nconfined himself to the management of organisations which were not principally focused on \u201ecrimes \nagainst humanity\u201f. Ten Bos & Willmott (2001: 782) argue that many of those who participated in Nazi \ngenocide were not themselves \u201einhuman\u201f monsters but rule-abiding employees who had developed a \n\u201ccalculating instinct\u201d for their private interests. They argue further that \u201cbureaucracy is a type of \norganization that allows, and indeed encourages, its members to develop this \u201ecalculating instinct\u201f \u201d \n(ibid.: 782). \n2. I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer for pointing out that there are resonances with Goffman\u201fs \n(1969) work in MacIntyre\u201fs use of theatrical metaphors. \n3. Such law-like generalizations in the organisational context would have to be of the form, \u201cIn \norganisations, if x, then y\u201d, and not, \u201cIn organisations, if x, then y, provided conditions a, b, c etc. hold \nover the extended period in question\u201d. It is challenging to find any examples of the former formulation \nfor anything other than the most trivial of situations, and equally challenging to specify all of the \nconditions a, b, c etc., that would need to hold for y to follow from x in situations that are non-trivial. \nBy contrast, in the natural sciences such statements are manifestly straightforward \u2013 as in, \u201cIf I drop \nthis apple, then it will fall\u201d. \n4. The four sources of systematic unpredictability are: the nature of radical conceptual innovation \n(which is, of course, inherently unpredictable); the unpredictability of certain of his own actions by \neach agent individually; the unpredictability that arises from the game-theoretic character of social life; \nand finally the pure contingency of chance.  \n5. I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer for pointing out that Merton\u201fs (1940) concept of \u201ctrained \nincapacity\u201d in bureaucratic structures might be applicable here, with managers trained to focus on \neffectiveness and efficiency and so professionally incapable of dealing with questions of morality. \n6. Du Gay, while partially supportive, is on balance highly critical of MacIntyre\u201fs position, but his \ncritique is not central to our concerns here. \n7. An example would be my watching (\u201cconsumption\u201d) of a cricket match where I can appreciate a \nsuperb cover drive because I played cricket in my youth and (once) hit such a shot. My wife is unable \nto appreciate cricket in that sense. Our positions are reversed when we go to watch a live performance \nof classical music. \n 33 \n8. I acknowledge that in my earlier work, particularly Moore (2002), I confused the issue by stating that \nbusiness was a practice. It is now clear to me that business generically cannot be a practice, but that \nbusiness organisations can be usefully re-described as practice-institution combinations. Within this re-\ndescription we always need to specify the practice itself \u2013 as here with fishing etc.. I am grateful to Ron \nBeadle for his assistance in helping to clarify this point. It is also quite possible, within this schema, \nhowever, that a particular mode of institutionalisation is such as to effectively prevent practice-like \nfeatures within it. However, I have argued elsewhere (Moore 2005b: 679) that all business activities, \nirrespective of their form of institutionalisation, must contain the vestiges of a practice and the virtues \nto some degree, for if they did not \u2013 that is, if the institution had \u201ewon\u201f so completely that the virtues \nhad suffered \u201csomething near total effacement\u201d (MacIntyre, 1985: 196) \u2013 then the institution would \nhave, in effect, \u201ekilled\u201f itself from the inside by failing to sustain the practice on which it itself is \nfounded. \n9. For a further exploration of what it means to be a craftsperson operating in a practice see Moore \n(2005a). \n10. It should be noted that this second practice of making and sustaining institutions will also require its \nown institutionalization. There is not space here to consider the legal, governance, social custom and \nother elements of this informal institutionalisation, although the role of business and management \nschools in this might be a profitable area for further consideration. \n11. I have previously used the term just purpose (Moore, 2005b; Moore & Beadle 2006) but on further \nconsideration the notion of good purpose is both wider ranging and more appropriate. \n12. In correspondence between Beadle and MacIntyre (Beadle 2002: 52 and also reported in Moore \n2002: 24), MacIntyre confirmed that, \u201c \u201eEmployment\u201f is not for me the name of either a type of \npractice or a type of institution or organisation, but rather one feature of the lives of certain types of \ninstitution or organisation\u201d. Beadle continues, \u201cIf this is the case for employment then so is it the case \nfor management\u201d. \n13. There is not space here to include discussion on the differences between administration, \nmanagement and leadership. The diagram might helpfully be used to illustrate the gradual and hard-to-\ndistinguish movement from predominantly administration at the left hand side to predominantly \nleadership at the right. I am, however, using management as a generic term to cover all three. \n14. In my early industrial career I had as my line manager a Director of Operations who had transferred \nfrom one part of the group involved in textiles to our part involved in paint manufacture. It emerged at \nsome point that prior to his transfer he had spent a day at a paint company personally making a batch of \npaint. He, I think, understood something of the need to have a \u201efeel\u201f for the core practice. \n15. In effect, the argument is that MacIntyre\u201fs schema, when elaborated and applied in the way it is \nhere, has done Parker\u201fs work for him in re-imagining management. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAkaah, I. and E.
