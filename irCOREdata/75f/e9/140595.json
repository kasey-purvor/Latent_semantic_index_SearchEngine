Among the technologies used for building specific \nrecognition properties, molecularly imprinted polymers, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are \nattracting much attention. In this critical review we describe many of methods used for imprinting \nrecognition for protein targets in polymers and their incorporation with a number of transducer \nplatforms with the aim of identifying the most promising approaches for the preparation of MIP-based \nprotein sensors. \n2 \n \n \n \n1. Introduction \nThe selective detection and quantification of protein targets has wide applicability to a number of \nfields, including clinical diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring, control of bioreactors and the \ndetection of organisms and toxins, including bio-terror agents. While laboratory-based methods such \nas HPLC-MS and immunoassay can provide precise measurements, they are generally too slow for \nsituations when a rapid response or intervention is needed. Under these circumstances a biosensor can \nprovide faster analysis with a direct read-out without the need to transport samples to a laboratory. \nBiosensors in which the recognition element is a molecularly imprinted receptor, rather that a \nbiomolecule, offer a number of advantages; notably greater long-term storage stability, potential re-\nusability, resistance to microbial spoilage and custom synthesis of selective receptors without the need \nto inoculate laboratory animals. The literature on molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for protein \ndetection however contains a multitude of potential methods which is compounded by the numerous \nmethods proposed for the transduction of the binding event to a useful signal. In this review we will \npresent a critical assessment of the methods of protein imprinting and MIP-based biosensor \ndevelopment with the aim of identifying the most promising strategies for the creation of a sensitive \nand selective MIP-based biosensor for a protein target. \n1.1 Key requirements of a biosensor for the detection of a specific protein \nSoper et al. (2006) defined a biosensor as a:  \n\u201c..bioanalytical device incorporating a biological material or a biomimic (e.g., tissue, microorganisms, \norganelles, cell receptors, enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, etc.), intimately associated with or \nintegrated within a physicochemical transducer or transducing microsystem, which may be optical, \nelectrochemical, thermometric, piezoelectric or magnetic. The usual aim of a biosensor is to produce \neither discrete or continuous digital electronic signals, which are proportional to a single analyte or a \nrelated group of analytes.\u201d1  \n3 \n \nThe key requirements of a biosensor for detection of a protein are that it should be specific for its \ntarget and capable of measuring the analyte concentration over the required analytical concentration \nrange. This requires that the recognition element (the \u201cbiological material or biomimic\u201d in the above \ndefinition) is capable of selective binding of the target analyte with high affinity. Additionally there is \nan increasing need for biosensors to be resistant to a variety of chemical environments and tolerant to \nextremes of temperature and humidity and to resist bio-fouling. The vast majority of biosensors rely \non biological reagents, including those of animal origin (enzymes and antibodies), to obtain the \nrequired specificity and selectivity for an assay. The selection of a suitable recognition element \nenables the assay to be both accurate and precise in its measurement. In nature the selectivity of these \nmolecules has arisen through the evolutionary need to protect the organism or to regulate other \nprocesses to ensure survival. The latter role is filled by enzymes, which catalyse a huge range of \nmetabolic and regulatory functions within the organism in a very specific and selective manner. These \nqualities have led to the utilisation of enzymes in devices such as the glucose biosensor.\n2\n  Another \nimportant class of bio-molecule used in sensing are the antibodies. These are typified by \nimmunoglobulin G (IgG), which is the familiar Y-shaped molecule which possesses two highly \nspecific and selective binding domains at the end of the arms of the \u201cY\u201d. IgG was first employed as \nthe recognition element by Yalow and Berson in a radio-immunoassays format,\n3\n and is now widely \nemployed in a range of biosensor and bioassay configurations. Whilst these bio-molecules fulfil the \nrequirements of specificity, selectivity and ease of use, such as the ability to absorb or chemically \ncouple to solid surfaces with little denaturation,\n4\n they have limited stability to extremes of temperature \n(denaturing above ~40 \u00baC) and humidity as well susceptibility to damage by shear forces, such as \nthose encountered in continuous monitoring situations. Recent efforts have included studies with \nantibodies and antibody fragments from camelids such as the llama\n5\n or from sharks\n6\n to overcome \nsome of these issues. These antibodies differ from conventional IgG since they consist of only a single \nheavy chain which imparts greater temperature stability without sacrificing specificity or selectivity. \nThe only drawback is that these proteins still have a tendency to unfold at higher temperature but re-\nfold to their original shape when the temperature is lowered, with the consequence that the reliability \nof assays utilising these molecules will diminish at operating temperatures above around 40 \u00baC. It is \n4 \n \nfor these reasons that biomimetic materials, such as molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are of \ninterest, since they hold the promise of selective recognition and robustness to a range of hash \noperating conditions not tolerated by their biological counterparts. \n1.2 Molecularly imprinted polymers  \nAs mentioned in the previous section, the construction of many current and future diagnostic devices \nrelies almost exclusively on the use of sophisticated biological receptors, such as enzymes, antibodies \nand DNA, as the chemical or biochemical recognition element.\n7-9\n Due to their biological origins, these \nbiomolecules may suffer from some inherent limitations when used in sensors and assays; for \nexample, poor reproducibility, instability during the manufacturing process and problems associated \nwith sterilisation. Synthetic receptors therefore may offer a promising alternative to antibodies and \nother biological receptors for use in biosensors.\n10\n  The most generic and cost-effective technique for \npreparing synthetic receptors, which combines high affinity and specificity with robustness and low \nmanufacturing costs is molecular imprinting.\n11\n  \nMolecular imprinting can be defined as the formation of specific recognition sites (with binding or \ncatalytic properties) in a material through its interaction with a template, where the template directs \nthe positioning and orientation of the material's structural components by a self-assembly mechanism \n(Figure 1). The material itself could be a linear sequence (in the most general sense, even DNA \nreplication is a type of imprinting process), polymeric (organic MIPs and inorganic imprinted silica \ngels) or 2-dimensional surface assemblies (grafted monolayers). MIPs have a range of advantages \nwhen compared with natural biomolecules (Table 1). Imprinted polymers can in theory be prepared \nfor any kind of substances. The best results however were obtained for molecules with molecular \nweights in the range of 200-1200 Da. \n \n \n5 \n \n \nFigure 1: Scheme of (a) three-dimensional and (b) two-dimensional imprinting polymerisation \n(courtesy of VTT, Finland). \n \nTable 1: Comparison of natural biomolecules used in sensors and MIPs.  \nNatural biomolecules MIPs \nLow stability Stable to low\/high pH, pressure and temperature \n(<180 \u00baC) \nHigh price of enzymes and receptors  Inexpensive and easy to prepare \n \nGenerally poor performance in non-aqueous \nmedia \nMIPs can work in organic solvents \n6 \n \nDifferent natural biomolecules have their own \noperational requirements (pH, ionic strength, \ntemperature, substrate etc.) \nDue to their minimal operational requirements, \nthe design of MIP-based multisensors is a \nrelatively easy task \nNatural receptors and enzymes exist for only a \nlimited number of important analytes \nIn principle, MIPs can be prepared for practically \nany compound \nPoor compatibility with micromachining \ntechnology and miniaturisation \nPolymers are fully compatible with \nmicromachining technology \nSoluble Most MIPs are insoluble co-polymers \n \nMany hundreds of examples of successful imprinting have been demonstrated, including MIPs for \ninorganic ions, drugs, nucleic acids, proteins and even microbial cells.\n12\n The resulting polymers are \nrobust, inexpensive and, in many cases, possess levels of affinity and specificity suitable for industrial \napplications. The quality of the synthesised materials depends to a large degree on the type of \ntemplate. For example, it is relatively easy to imprint rigid and stable lipophillic drug molecules with \nseveral polar functional groups.\n13\n Other factors which affect the quality of MIPs include: monomer \ncomposition, solvents, polymerisation time, temperature, even the application of a magnetic field.\n14\n \nImprinted polymers can be produced in bulk, in thin film format and as membranes\n15\n or as a \nsuspension of spherical particles with well-defined size.\n16\n The high specificity and stability of MIPs \nrenders them promising alternatives to enzymes, antibodies, and natural receptors for use in sensor \ntechnology.\n17,18\n The growing interest in MIPs can be illustrated by the fact that almost 10% of all \npapers published on the subject of \u201cbiosensor\u201d nowadays are MIP-related. \n The main driving forces for the substitution of antibodies with MIPs in sensors are the high \nstability of the polymers and their low price. Typically the lifetime of antibodies is restricted to a 6-12 \nmonths window. They may need to be stored in a refrigerated environment, and antibody-based \nsensors usually cannot be regenerated for more than about 10 cycles. In contrast, MIPs can be stored \nat ambient temperature for years without any noticeable loss in affinity. They can be autoclaved and \nregenerated many times using strongly acidic or basic wash steps or by washing with organic \n7 \n \nsolvents. All these features make them very attractive for use in robust sensors and assays. MIPs are \nalso two orders of magnitude cheaper then antibodies. A range of MIPs for different targets are \navailable commercially at a price varying from $0.1-0.5 mg\n-1\n. By comparison, the cost of antibodies \nvaries depending on the target but typically lies in the range $100-1000 mg\n-1. Even relatively \u201ccheap\u201d \nimmunoaffinity cartridges with a low density of immobilised antibodies still demand a relatively high \nprice by comparison with MIPs, costing between $10 to $100 mg\n-1\n.  \nThere are however some perceived limitations associated with the development of MIP sensors: (i) \nabsence of a general procedure for MIP preparation; (ii) difficulty in integrating them with a \ntransducer; (iii) difficulty in transforming the binding event into an electric signal. Most of these \nproblems however have been addressed in recent years.\n19,20\n \n \n1.2.1 MIP design \nOne of the major problems in MIP design is the choice of an optimal polymerization protocol for the \ndevelopment of MIPs. This is mainly because of the need to select and optimise a multitude of \nvariable parameters such as the types of monomer to be used in polymer synthesis (more than 4 \nthousands polymerisable compounds are commercially available), solvents, temperature, pressure \netc.\n21\n The most advanced approaches available for the selection of appropriate functional monomers \ninclude combinatorial and computational methods.\n22\n In combinatorial approaches the best \ncomposition is selected on the basis of simultaneous synthesis and testing of tens to hundreds of \nimprinted polymers prepared on a small scale.\n23-25\n In the computational approach the monomer \nscreening is performed virtually.\n26,27\n These two approaches permit the creation of MIPs with affinities \nand selectivities comparable to those of antibodies,\n26\n (Table 2).  \n In relation to the molecular imprinting of proteins and cells there is currently insufficient \nevidence from the literature to judge whether combinatorial or computational approaches might offer \nany substantial advantage. In contrast to the recognition of small molecules, which relies on strong \nelectrostatic interactions, recognition of large biomolecules and cells is achieved through shape \n8 \n \ncomplementarity combined with (weak) van der Vaals interactions and the formation of hydrogen \nbonds.\n28\n Thus, most often, imprinting of these species is successfully performed using weakly cross-\nlinked single monomers such as acrylamide or aminophenyl boronic acid.\n29,30\n \n  \nTable 2. Affinity and sensitivity range of computationally designed molecularly imprinted polymer in \ncomparison with antibodies raised against the same target.\n26\n \nReceptor Kd, nM Sensitivity range, \uf06dg L-1 \nComputational MIP 0.3 \u00b1 0.08 0.1-100 \nMonoclonal antibody 0.03 \u00b1 0.004 0.025-5 \nPolyclonal antibody 0.5 \u00b1 0.07 0.05-10 \n \nThe most significant benefits stemming from the use of combinatorial or computational approaches in \nMIP design are reductions in both time and cost involved in the development process. Depending on \nthe number of tests required, the typical time needed to develop a novel MIP can be as short as 3-4 \nweeks.\n31\n \n \n1.2.2 Integration with sensors \nThe integration of MIPs with sensors can be achieved by in situ polymerisation, using either \nphotochemical or thermal initiation,\n32\n or by surface grafting with chemical or UV initiation.\n33,34\n The \nadvantage of this latter approach lies in the possibility of controlled modification of inert electrode \nsurfaces with thin films of specific polymers. Polymers can also be electropolymerised on the surface \nof physical transducers. For example, the electropolymerisation of phenylenediamine in the presence \nof glucose was successfully used in the construction of an imprinted sensor for the conductometric \ndetection of this compound\n35\n (Figure 2). \n9 \n \n Basically, polymers can either be produced separately, for later integration with existing \n(electrochemical, piezoelectric or optical) sensors, or be produced by in situ methods directly on the \nsensor surface. For ease of quality control it is better to produce polymers separately, in a dedicated \nlaboratory in the form of membranes or powders, followed by extraction of the template and \ncharacterisation of the materials obtained. This will follow the modern trend in biosensors \ndevelopment whereby the suppliers of biological components are \u201cseparated\u201d from the manufacturing \nof detectors and sensor assembly. This model would be difficult to apply for applications where MIPs \nneed to be deposited as thin layers, of the order of nanometres, e.g. in evanescent wave sensors.\n36\n One \npossible compromise could be the development of methods for the production of MIP nanoparticles, \n\u201cplastic antibodies\u201d, which can be handled by sensor manufacturers in much the same way as \ntraditional (natural) antibodies or enzymes.\n37,38\n In order to prove the feasibility of this approach, there \nis a need for the development of generic and versatile procedures for the synthesis of MIP \nnanoparticles for various targets. One potential advance in this area could be the development of an \nautomated \u201cnanoreactor\u201d for the reproducible synthesis of monodisperse MIP nanoparticles. A reactor \nsimilar to that proposed here has recently been produced for the preparation of MIP microparticles \n(Figure 3) and it may be possible to tune its characteristics for the production of nanoparticles.\n39\n  \n \n10 \n \n \n \n  \nFigure 2.

Receptor sensors exploit the ability of a MIP to change its \nconformation upon binding with the template, leading to changes in a measurable property, such as \nconductivity, permeability or surface potential.\n17,41\n Alternatively, sensors can be designed that use the \nability of a functional monomer to change its properties upon interaction with the template; in most \ncases, changes in fluorescence are employed.\n42,43\n In one example of this type of material, a fluorescent \nsensor for cAMP detection was constructed using the environmentally-sensitive dye, trans-4-[p-(N,N-\ndimethylamino)styryl]-N-vinylbenzylpyridinium chloride)\n44\n (Figure 4). The resulting polymer \ndisplayed both functions of template recognition and sensing. \n \n12 \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

A New Generation of Chemical Sensors Based on MIPs. In: Piletsky S, Turner \nA, eds. Molecular Imprinting of Polymers. Austin: Landes Bioscience, 2006:64-79. \n \nSeveral recent publications have described the development of catalytic sensors based on MIPs.  In \none such study we have used a transition state analogue approach to prepare a MIP with catalytic \nproperties similar to the enzyme tyrosinase in the form of an electrochemical sensor for the \nmeasurement of catechol and dopamine concentration.\n45\n Further developments in catalytic receptors \nbased on MIPs will depend largely on the successful preparation of MIP-based catalysts which can \nreact with water-soluble and practically important analytes.\n46,47\n  \n \n13 \n \nIn relation to protein detection, the integration of MIPs with acoustic, surface plasmon resonance or \nsurface enhanced Raman sensors might seem to be the most promising platforms.\n48,49\n These sensors \ndo not require the use of enzyme or fluorescent labels and could be used for the direct measurement of \nanalyte concentrations. Alternatively, fluorescent, gold coated or magnetic MIP nanoparticles can be \nused in lateral flow sensor devices as a direct replacement for antibodies.\n50-53\n \n \n2. Template selection \nWhen considering proteins as targets for detection by MIP-based sensors, the question arises what is \nthe best material to use as a template in order to obtain the required specificity in recognition of the \ntarget? Since some of these problems are common to decisions about how to raise effective antibodies \nto peptides and proteins, we will first consider in this section what tools are available to those working \nin biological aspects of molecular recognition, followed by a review of how the imprinting has been \napproached.  \n2.1 Protein structure, antigenicity and tools for structural analysis \nThe antigens bound by antibodies can be classified into groups of smaller, and individually non-\nimmunogenic, molecules termed haptens, and larger molecules \u2013 often proteins. Key early work \ndetailing the binding of antibodies and the complementarity determining region (CDR) began with the \ninvestigation of specificity by Lansteiner and van der Scheer,\n54\n the binding of small molecules within \nthe hapten binding cleft by Amzel et al.\n55\n and the interaction with larger proteins by Amit et al.\n56\n \nUnlike larger protein molecules, haptens do not induce the formation of antibodies due to the inability \nof B-cells to process the small fragments for presentation to T-helper cells in order to trigger the \nproduction of various B-cell receptor ligands and cytokines necessary for B-cell clonal expansion, but \ncan be used to do so when complexed with a larger molecule, such as a protein.  \n \n14 \n \nMolecular Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) do not rely on such complex biological signalling for their \nproduction, thereby providing opportunities to design receptors for a range of molecule sizes, \nincluding the opportunity to produce receptors to pharmacologically active, or otherwise toxic \ncompounds. The aim, when designing synthetic receptors, is to mimic \u2013 or even improve upon \u2013 the \nspecificity of natural antibodies. The binding of antigens to antibodies is well understood, and the \nnature of that interaction (including the important aspects we must consider when attempting to \ndesign such interactions) is as relevant to synthetic receptors, such as MIPs, as it is to the natural \nmolecules. \n \nRegions of a protein that can be classified as antigenic determinants within the structure of a globular \nprotein have been called epitopes, a term coined by Niels Jerne, winner of the 1984 Nobel Prize for \nmedicine (immunology). It is helpful to also use the term to describe the target region of a protein for \nsynthetic receptors.\n57\n Early studies\n58,59\n showed that natural epitopes of proteins are often found at the \nsurface, and this observation appears to hold. Whilst it is clear that only surface residues are available \nto be involved in epitopes, there are several structural arrangements by which this is possible.  \n \nThe residues which comprise an epitope must be present in a conformation which will be accessible to \nthe antigen-binding region (paratope) of an antibody, or to the binding site of a synthetic receptor. The \nresidues in the epitope may achieve such a conformational arrangement through spatial proximity \nbrought about by the tertiary structure of the globular protein; by their positions within a repeating \nmotif of secondary structure such as an alpha helix or beta sheet; or simply by being adjacent residues \nin the primary sequence in a loop or coil region. \n \nObviously, these arrangements are often mutually exclusive when surface availability is considered. \nResidues which form an epitope should exhibit both spatial proximity within the confines of the \n15 \n \nconformation of the receptor binding site, and surface availability for binding. It is likely therefore, \nthat the epitope brought about by tertiary conformation will be the most common for natural \nantigenicity, given that it is defined by the folded and naturally occurring structure of the protein. \n \nEpitopes which are determined simply through proximity of adjacent residues are, conceptually, \nperhaps the least likely to be observed in natural situations. The arrangement of residues must survive \nthe formation of secondary structure motifs, and subsequent folding of the protein into tertiary \nstructure. Therefore, for such an epitope to be present in a naturally folded protein, it is unlikely for \nthe residues which comprise it to be particularly hydrophobic. A highly hydrophobic residue is more \nlikely to be either internalised within the structure, or possibly situated within an alpha helix. The \nhelical structure would be either internal, or through its structure have removed the linear availability \nthrough the helical turns. \n \nAlthough, a beta sheet would be more likely to retain the local linear structure of such an epitope, the \ncharacteristics of the other residues within the sheet will influence its position within the tertiary \nstructure. Whilst this does not necessarily mean that the availability of the linear epitope will be lost, \nit does mean that the characteristics of the residues which are adjacent to the epitope in the sequence \nwill play a large role in determining its availability. \n \nIt has been suggested that segmental mobility, or flexibility, is linked to antigenicity,\n60,61\n which would \nindicate that the most suitable epitope sites would occur in loop regions of the protein structure. It has \nsubsequently been hypothesised however, that any region of a protein that is accessible at the surface \ncan potentially interact with an antibody.\n62\n More recent studies of antigen-antibody binding have \nsuggested that flexibility of the CDR loop regions of the antibody is important for antigen binding.\n63\n \nThis flexibility allows for an \u201einduced fit\u201f mechanism for antigen binding, which could logically be \n16 \n \naided by flexibility of the antigen structure. Therefore, whilst any surface-available region of a protein \nmay have the potential to interact with an antibody, perhaps regions of higher mobility or flexibility \nwill afford better affinity with an antibody. \n \nThe flexibility that aids antibody-antigen binding is likely to be similarly beneficial to the interaction \nbetween protein targets and synthetic receptors. The dynamic nature of biomolecules means that some \nmovement of the structure is likely either through variations in temperature, solution concentration or \npressure. The same is, of course, true of the receptor, synthetic or otherwise. MIPs may be rigid, \nhighly cross-linked structures or less cross-linked, flexible structures with variable solution content, \ntending towards hydrogels.\n64,65\n A flexible MIP may mimic the \u201einduced fit\u201f model of the antibody \nCDR, although the nature of the polymer may negate some of the properties leading to robustness and \nlongevity inherent in a rigid polymer. By utilising a highly flexible region for the target, some of the \nbenefits of the molecular dynamics of the protein can still be exploited even in combination with a \nrigid synthetic MIP receptor. \n \nWhole proteins can be used to raise antibodies or produce synthetic receptors but, whilst this method \nensures that the receptor is capable of binding the natural form of the protein, there are some \ndrawbacks. The main difficulty is in obtaining a purified sample of the protein target with which to \nprepare the receptor. Others may include the solubility of the highly hydrophobic transmembrane \ndomains of membrane proteins, the size of the protein, and toxic or otherwise detrimental effects \ncaused by the protein on the host animal when considering immunisation methods for producing \nantibodies. \n \nSome of these drawbacks may be overcome by the use of recombinant proteins, but all can be avoided \nby cleavage or synthesis of a fragment of the target protein to create a new target substructure. A \n17 \n \nreceptor for this smaller fragment will still be capable of binding to the native protein, as long as it \ncan be ensured that the fragment is a peptide that would ordinarily be available at the surface. For \nartificial receptors such as MIPs, the fragment can be used alone or conjugated to a larger entity, (such \nas a protein, which is necessary when producing antibodies, or, for example a micro- or nano-particle \nor planar surface in the case of MIPs) to influence orientation and cavity generation. When a carrier \nprotein is used, a purification step would be required to ensure that affinity for the peptide can be \nselected for, rather than binding to the carrier. \n \nThe use of small peptides as \u201esynthetic antigens\u201f is attributed to pioneering work by Michael Sela and \nRuth Arnon during a career of joint publications spanning 40 years. Their use of synthetic antigens as \na research tool led to better understanding of immunological processes, and specifically autoimmune \ndisease, culminating in the development of Copaxone, a drug indicated for the treatment of relapsing-\nremitting multiple sclerosis.\n66\n Earlier work investigated the use of synthetic antigens comprised of \npoly-amino acids. One such experiment showed that a multi-chain copolymer of poly-DL-alanine \nattached to polypeptides containing L-tyrosine and L-glutamic acid, was strongly antigenic in \nrabbits.\n67\n Such a synthetic polypeptide antigen was subsequently used to demonstrate the use of \nSephadex columns for the purification of antibodies \u2013 a technique which is now widely used.68  \n \nThe activity of antibodies raised to a synthetic antigen was demonstrated for the first time in 1979 \nwhen a fragment of an MS-2 bacteriophage coat protein was used as a synthetic antigen to inoculate a \nrabbit. This approach was successful in raising antibodies reactive to the native protein.\n69\n The ability \nto produce protein-specific antibodies from genomic sequence-derived synthetic peptide antigens was \nfurther investigated by Lerner et al.\n70\n The major outer envelope protein of the hepatitis B virus was \nchosen, as the gene sequence was known and the virus was considered to be of interest. The (at the \ntime unpublished) computational method of Kyte and Doolittle,\n71\n was used to investigate the \nhydrophobicity of the protein, and peptide sequences were chosen from the less hydrophobic regions. \n18 \n \nAntibodies were produced which reacted to the native protein, the authors speculating that similar \ntechniques could produce excellent vaccines. \n \nThis work subsequently prompted further investigation of the use of synthetic peptides to raise \nantibodies to important viral targets. Synthetic antigens were chosen from the translated amino acid \nsequence of foot and mouth disease virus after analysis using structure prediction algorithms that was \ncross-referenced with known information regarding serotypes and experimentally-derived natural \nepitopes. The resulting antibodies were shown to specifically bind and neutralise the virus.\n72\n  \n \nSo, in order to raise antibodies or design synthetic receptors, a suitable target is required, and there is \nthe choice of either using the whole protein, or a fragment of it as the antigen.  \n \nIf only a fragment is to be used, then there arises the question of how to select the fragment. Natural \nepitopes can be elucidated through experimentation, synthesised and used. Alternatively, any peptide \nfragment may be used if it can be assured that it will be available for binding in the final structure.  \nAdditionally, the selection of a novel peptide provides the possibility of targeting regions of the \nprotein which have not been demonstrated to be antigenic in vivo, but which may offer improved \naccess or affinity for detection in sensing applications. \n \nThe simplest way to decide if a fragment will be solvent-accessible is to look at its position within the \ntertiary structure of the protein. This is the most suitable approach if X-ray or NMR structural data is \navailable in the Protein Databank.\n73\n However, as there are currently only around 61,000 structures \ndeposited in the database \u2013 including many duplications and encompassing many species \u2013 it is clear \n19 \n \nthat there is a significant possibility that a target that appears suitable from other experimental or \u201c\u2013\nomics\u201d approaches may not have a solved structure (www.pdb.org).  \n \nWhen a protein has no experimentally determined structure, the best method for trying to obtain a \nmodel of the structure is to compare the sequence to that of a protein of known structure. This can be \nespecially successful when the two proteins in question belong to the same family of functional \nproteins. The databases SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins)\n74\n and CATH (Class, \nArchitecture, Topology and Homology)\n75\n are both linked through the entries in the PDB, and provide \na classification of protein structures into functional and structural subdomains. Such information can \nbe useful when comparing an unknown sequence to partial homologous structures. \n \nWhen attempting to model tertiary structure based on homology, there are several steps which should \nbe undertaken. Initially, a sequence alignment against proteins of known structure should be \nperformed, followed by matching the unknown sequence onto the structure of the homologue. Finally, \noptimisation of the structure, in particular modelling of sidechain torsions and interactions and energy \nminimisation of loops needs to be done to refine the model. In order to search for homology to known \nstructures, the Fugue tool (tardis.nibio.go.jp\/fugue\/)\n76\n can be used to search the Homstrad database \n(tardis.nibio.go.jp\/homstrad\/)\n77\n of curated protein alignment structures, using other software used for \nthe structure determination and optimisation. Alternatively the web-based Swiss-Model \n(swissmodel.expasy.org\/)\n78\n can be used to align against Homstrad and determine a model in one step. \n \nIf the protein in question has no significant homology with another protein of known structure, the \nnext logical step is to try and predict elements of the secondary structure from the primary amino acid \nsequence. The current practice of protein secondary structure prediction is dominated by the use of \nneural networks or complex statistical analysis for the determination of residue conformation states, \n20 \n \nas well as older propensity-based statistical approaches which, whilst being somewhat inaccurate, \nhave the benefit of ease of use and being well understood by their end users. Such methods have seen \ncontinued effort at improvement over the years, but it should generally still be considered a \u201elast \noption\u201f approach to resort to predictions of structure from sequences in the absence of homology. \n \nOne notable methodology which has been adapted for use as part of an on-line tool (www.embl-\nheidelberg.de\/predictprotein\/predictprotein.html) is that of Rost.\n79\n Available as the PredictProtein \nserver,\n80\n there are several methods available including; PHDsec for secondary structure; PHDacc for \nsolvent accessibility; and PHDhtm for predicting transmembrane helix domains,\n81\n all of which use \nneural networks for analysis. The author reports accuracies of 72 percent for the PHDsec algorithm, \nand a significant 95 percent for the predictions of PHDhtm. \n \nDespite the growing availability of on-line tools and the popularity of the more complex methods, \nthere remains a niche application for some of the \u201esimpler\u201f approaches, relying on statistical analysis \nof known structures. These form the basis of many other secondary structure prediction, and antigenic \nregion prediction algorithms. \n \nOne such well-known algorithm based on statistical propensities is that of Garnier et al.\n82\n The GOR \nalgorithm uses sets of experimentally-derived scales defining the propensities of amino acids to form \nhelix, sheet, turn or coil conformations. The propensity for a given confirmation is compared for each \namino acid in a sequence, which is then unambiguously assigned to a particular state based on the \nhighest of the propensity values. In addition to the statistical propensity approach used by GOR, \nanalysis of protein hydrophobicity has also been used to establish general structural features of \nproteins based on empirical evidence of hydrophobic\/hydrophilic behaviour of residues. The original \nuse of this approach was published by Hopp and Woods\n83\n who proposed the use of hydrophilicity as \n21 \n \nan indication of potential antigenic domains due to their predicted solvent accessibility. The Hopp-\nWoods scale was applied using a program originally written in Fortran. The single scale of author-\nmodified hydrophilicity scales, taken from Levitt,\n84\n was applied using a sliding window, equivalent to \nthe suggested size of a hexapeptide antigenic structural motif.  \n \nA similar approach was detailed by Kyte and Doolittle,\n71\n where experimentally-determined values for \nresidue hydrophobicity were used to identify internal or transmembrane regions of a protein structure. \nThe Kyte-Doolittle scale was implemented using an original program written in C. A single scale of \nassigned hydrophilic\/hydrophobic values derived by the authors from water\/vapour, water\/ethanol, \nand ethanol\/vapour free energies for each amino acid, and applied using a sliding window of 7, 9, 11, \nor 13 residues, arbitrarily assigned depending on the size of the structural motif being predicted. The \nhydrophobicity\/hydrophilicity analysis techniques are still used, but more often in combination with \nother structure prediction techniques based on propensities of residues to occur in particular structural \nelements.  \n \nA list of protein structure prediction algorithms (and other computational analysis tools) is maintained \nat the ExPASy (Expert  Protein Analysis System) proteomics server from the Swiss Bioinformatics \nInstitute (www.expasy.org\/tools), serving as an excellent starting point for prediction of protein \nstructural characteristics. \n \nIn addition to the many algorithms which have been written to predict structural conformations, there \nare others which attempt to predict antigenic regions and epitopes of proteins such as the Hopp-\nWoods analysis,\n83\n mentioned above. It is normal for structural prediction algorithms to be used to \npredict the structure only, and antigenic region prediction methods to be used to identify potential \nepitopes only. In the case where multiple algorithms have been used together, and structural and \n22 \n \nantigenic prediction methods combined, the full structural analysis is used and added to the \npredictions of antigenicity. \n \nOne such method is that developed by Parker et al.,\n85\n derived from high-performance liquid \nchromatography (HPLC) of 20 model synthetic peptides, each containing a motif specific to each of \nthe 20 naturally occurring amino acids found in proteins. The retention time of the peptide was \nmeasured and attributed as a measure of hydrophilicity to each amino acid. This scale of \nhydrophilicities was applied using a sliding window assignment modified from Hopp-Woods, in \ncombination with a scale of accessibility taken from Janin et al.,\n86\n and accessibility values from \nKarplus and Schulz,\n87\n as a measure of potential antigenicity. Another example is that of Pellequer and \nWesthof,\n88\n  which includes analyses from 22 different scales including hydrophilicity, accessibility, \nflexibility and secondary structure propensity. \n \nPerhaps the most well known method which uses a combination of different algorithms is the \nAntigenic Index.\n89\n The original algorithm was written in the common, mathematically oriented \nFortran for the VAX platform. The Antigenic index is calculated from numerical expressions of \nresults from slightly author-modified versions of the Hopp-Woods, Janin et al, Karplus and Schultz, \nGOR, and Chou-Fasman\n90\n algorithms.  \n \nOne notable single approach that has not been incorporated into multiple approaches is that of \nKolaskar and Tongaonkar.\n91\n  The method incorporates a scale of statistical antigenic propensities \nderived from an analysis of 34 different proteins, with experimentally determined epitope regions, \napplied using a sliding window of seven residues. It is of note primarily because it is so easily \navailable to molecular biologists through its inclusion with the European Molecular Biology Open \nSoftware Suite (EMBOSS) as the programme \u201eantigenic\u201f (www.emboss.sourceforge.net). The suite is \n23 \n \nwidely available and includes many tools for simple and routine bioinformatic analysis useful to \nbiological researchers.\n92\n Despite being a simple approach, it is popular due to its accessibility, and the \nreported accuracy of 75 percent. \n \nAuthors report a wide range of accuracy values for these computational prediction methods, and often \nthe performance is evaluated with widely different approaches. Simple methods tend to be fairly \ninaccurate, particularly when testing is re-visited with new evaluation techniques and datasets. \nClearly, having experimentally determined structural data is the ideal, but where prediction methods \nmust be used there is often a compromise to be made between speed and accuracy. It is important to \nconsider the methods carefully and be aware of the limitations of the technique. Although perhaps \nobvious, one of the most important things to remember regarding any form of structure prediction is \nthat an algorithm which is reported as having 70 percent accuracy is in effect 30 percent inaccurate. \nOf interest perhaps, is the commentary on pitfalls of protein sequence analysis by Rost and \nValencia,\n93\n which discusses many issues surrounding the successful use and interpretation of structure \npredictions.  \n \n2.2 Methods of imprinting proteins \nThe earliest attempts at imprinting proteins used whole protein molecules as the template. These \napproaches were based on forming a few spatially-separated interactions with specific side chain \nresidues on the surface of the protein; such as copper-mediated binding of histidine imidazole \ngroups.\n94\n In this example a \u201csurface-imprinting\u201d approach was used to avoid encapsulating the \ntemplate, which was dissolved in a DMF\/water mixture. N-(4-vinyl)-benzyl iminodiacetic acid groups \nwere employed as functional monomer units to chelate copper (II) ions. The chelate groups were \ncaptured at the surface of vinyl-functionalised silica particles. The imprinted material was shown to \nseparate RNase A (template protein) from Lysozyme in an HPLC experiment. This approach was \nsimilar to that proposed earlier by Arnold and co-workers, who demonstrated the use of copper (II) \n24 \n \niminodiacetate groups to recognise a series of bis-imidazoles as protein surrogates.\n95-100\n There are a \nnumber of potential problems with this approach, the first being the use of aqueous DMF as the \nsolvent for imprinting a protein. This is by no means a \u201ckind\u201d solvent mixture and many proteins \nwould be denatured under these conditions. The use of a small number of strong interactions is also \nnot ideal. While there appeared to be separation under dynamic (chromatographic) conditions, any \nprotein with surface-exposed imidazole residues would be expected to bind reasonably tightly to \ncopper sites on the silica surface. It is likely that non-specific binding would therefore be high for a \nlarge range of protein molecules. The lack of a three-dimensional element to the surface-bound \n\u201cpolymer\u201d is also a limiting factor for good protein recognition (Figure 5). \n \n \n \n25 \n \n Figure 5. Proposed \u201csurface imprinting\u201d of RNase A via copper (II) N-(4-vinyl)-benzyl \niminodiacetate groups at the surface of silica particles functionalised with double bonds. Adapted \nfrom Kempe et al.\n94\n \n \nPolymerisation at the surface of silica particles was also employed by Burow and Minoura to prepare \nMIPs for glucose oxidase (GOD).\n101\n The aim was to build a thin layer of polymer from a mixture of \nwater-soluble cross-linking monomers (N,N'-1,2-dihydroxyethylene-bis(acrylamide) and  N,N'- \n(methylene)-bisacrylamide) in a phosphate-buffered solution of the enzyme template. This approach \nattempted to provide for 3-dimensional recognition and avoided the use of a few strong interactions \nfor potentially many weaker ones and was reasonably successful in imparting specific binding to the \nMIP. Rebinding in batch mode showed selectivity for GOD with respect to glucose dehydrogenase \n(GHD) on the MIP and a BSA-imprinted polymer showed the same non-specific interactions with \nGHD.  \n \nThe group of Hjert\u00e9n\n102\n reported imprinting of whole protein in acrylamide gels prepared with much \nlower levels of cross-linking. These \u201cartificial gel antibodies\u201d as they were later called are relatively \nsoft material possessing pores large enough for proteins to diffuse through the polymer, being similar \nin composition to polyacrylamide gels used for protein separation. Hemoglobin, cytochrome C and \ntransferrin were used as templates in this initial study. The imprinted gels were granulated by passage \nthrough 100-mesh sieves and packed into columns in Pasteur pipettes. These small affinity columns \nshowed selective binding of the template proteins from mixtures, with high retention of the template. \nHigh selectively was also demonstrated by the ability to adsorb myoglobin from horse but not whale \nmyoglobin on the horse myoglobin-imprinted column, demonstrating selectivity for two proteins with \nsimilar sequences and 3D structures.\n103,104\n The same approach has also been used to prepare imprinted \ngel within the pores of particles made from a more rigid gel (agarose) in order to improve the flow \nrate in chromatography.\n105\n \u201cGel antibodies\u201d prepared by the same approach have been employed in an \n26 \n \nelectrophoretic migration technique with bacteria\n106\n and viruses\n107\n employed as templates, as well as \nproteins.\n108,109\n The migration of the gel particles in a rotating tube under an electrophoretic field \ndepends on their overall charge. Since the acrylamide particles are neutral they only become charged \nand can migrate in the electric field when they rebind their respective templates. The use of the \nmaterials in clinical diagnosis and the detection of protein biomarkers was recently demonstrated\n110,111\n \nand the approach was also shown to be applicable to the preparation of enzyme reactor beds.\n112\n The \nlater paper also suggests that \u201crenewable biosensors\u201d for viruses, bacteria and spores could easily be \ncreated using the gel antibody approach. \n \nA \u201cwhole\u201d protein approach was also reported by Venton and Gudipati,113 using a mixture of silane \nmonomers, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and tetraethylorthosilicate (1:3), to prepare a siloxane \npolymer in the presence of urease or bovine serum albumin (BSA). The polymers became entrapped \nin the polysiloxane matrix and were also probably covalently bound to the polymer through reactive \nside chain residues. Template species were removed by digestion with pronase and a moderate \nselectivity in rebinding was seen in binding experiments with the two proteins and their respective \nimprinted polymers. Attempts to reproduce this result with the protein couple haemoglobin and \nmyoglobin did not show any selectivity however.  \n \nCompared with other methods, the use of whole protein in solution presents few advantages as a \ngeneral approach to preparing MIPs for sensor applications. The main advantage is that the template \nstructure will most accurately reflect that of the target (assuming the target and template are the same \nprotein) however this is largely outweighed by a number of disadvantages namely: the template may \neasily become entrapped or covalently bound to the polymer, it may be difficult to maintain the native \nconformation of the protein throughout the polymerisation process and the large imprinted sites may \nbe seen as general nanopores, able to bind a range of smaller polypeptides, resulting in reduced \n27 \n \nselectivity. For these reasons, a number of other strategies, involving surrogate templates, have been \nemployed. \n \n \n \nFigure 6. Schematic diagram of epitope imprinting: a short peptide sequence is used as the template \nto create selective binding sites for a larger peptide or protein. Adapted from Rachov and Minoura.\n57\n \n \nAn alternative to the use of whole protein as template is the \u201cepitope approach\u201d, originally proposed \nby Rachov and Minoura.\n57,114-116\n In this method a peptide with the same sequence as one of the \nterminal chains of the target protein (the epitope) is used as a surrogate template for the whole protein \n28 \n \n(Figure 6). This approach is analogous to protein recognition by antibodies, where an \u201cepitope\u201d of the \nimmunogenic protein is the site of antibody binding, not the whole protein. In the imprinting context \nthe template peptide generally represents one of the terminal sequences of the primary protein \nstructure, although an antibody epitope could be any surface-accessible region of the target protein. \nTerminal peptides make better imprinting targets because their structure is unambiguously defined \nand relative to other regions of the target protein, they will have fewer interactions with the protein \nsecondary structure, which may hinder or frustrate binding. The minimum length of peptide necessary \nto create \u201cunique\u201d recognition for the target protein has been estimated to be around 9 amino acids \naccording to Nishino et al.\n117\n These authors also state that an exposed C-terminus is preferable, since \nthis site is less prone to post-translational modifications.\n118,119\n While Nishino et al.\n117\n used \nnonapeptide epitopes as template, peptides as small as tri-\n120\n and tetra-peptides\n114\n and as large as 15-\n121\n or 16-\n122\n amino-acid units have been used to target other proteins. \n \nThe surface imprinting method applied by Nishino and co-workers\n117\n (Figure 7) was shown to be \neffective at selective extraction of the target protein from mixtures, such that Cytochrome c (Cyt c), \nalcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were found to be selectively \ncaptured by polymers imprinted with their respective C-terminal peptide epitopes from mixtures \ncontaining five proteins. The templates were: AYLKKATNE (Cyt c from bovine-heart, amino acids \n97\u2013104), AYLKKATNE (ADH from yeast, amino acids 339\u2013347) and VVSTQTALA (BSA amino \nacids 599\u2013607). Each was immobilised by its N-terminus on a planar Si\/SiO2 surface through \ncoupling to a carboxy-functionalised silane linker. Photopolymerisation of an acrylamide\/ethylene-\nbis-acrylamide polymer thin film at the surface produced the imprinted layer which could be peeled-\noff the template assembly to reveal the binding surface. Rebinding was also shown to be sensitive to \nsubstitution of one amino acid residue and non-specific binding to the imprinted surface was low. \n \n \n29 \n \n \n \nFigure 7. The surface-bound epitope approach employed by the group of Shea using C-terminal \nnonapeptides as templates for protein imprinting. Selective binding of the target proteins (Cyt c, ADH \nand BSA) was demonstrated from mixtures of Cyt c, ADH, BSA, carbonic anhydrase and trypsin \ninhibitor. Adapted from Nishino et al.\n117\n \nA number of advantages therefore stem from using terminal peptide epitopes as the template, namely: \nthe conformation of whole protein does not need to be retained, allowing harsher solvent and \ntemperature conditions to be used; selectivity in protein recognition can be controlled by the choice of \nepitope and its length; template removal is far more easily achieved than with whole protein and \nhighly selective imprints can be obtained. On the other hand, a good knowledge of the protein \nstructure is necessary, but as we have seen from the earlier discussion, there are a number of \ncomputational and database-based methods available which can help. Another limitation is that \ncustom synthesis may be required in order to prepare the templates which may be relatively costly and \ntime-consuming.  \n \n30 \n \n2.3 Template presentation  \nFor the imprinting of small molecules it is usually sufficient to dissolve the template, monomers and \ninitiator in a porogenic solvent prior to the formation of MIPs, whether the resultant material is to be a \nmonolith, bead, film or membrane. This approach can be followed when imprinting proteins or their \nepitopes, but the results are likely to be suboptimal due to a number of phenomena: protein \nentrapment, resulting in poor template removal and steric hindrance limiting rebinding of bulky \nprotein molecules being just two. For these reasons it is preferable to form imprints for protein \nbinding at surfaces or interfaces between phases to overcome these problems. \n \nImprinting methods at a planar surface or interface can be termed 2-dimensional approaches. These \ninclude the capture of protein complexes at existing surfaces, as in the example shown in Figure 5,\n94\n \nand the organisation of surfactant-like molecules in Langmuir monolayers.\n123\n While these 2-D \nimprints can show some selectivity, it is unlikely to ever be a suitable method for sensing \napplications, as non-specific binding is always likely to be high with such materials.  \n \nA degree of three-dimensional imprinting of whole protein can be achieved with \u201csurface imprinting\u201d \nmethods. A good deal of ingenuity has been shown in the devising of methods for the partial \nembedding of protein templates in polymer without complete encapsulation. These methods include \ncontact printing and interfacial methods. A number of these are summarised in the graphic below \n(Figure 8). These examples cover a wide range of materials in which the imprints are made: plasma-\npolymer,\n124\n metal,\n125\n polysilanes,\n126\n poly(acrylamide)\n127\n and poly(dopamine)\n128\n as well as a diverse set \nof techniques to prepare imprints on planar surfaces,\n124,125,127\n beads\n126\n and nanowires\n128\n with various \ndegrees of complexity involved in their realisation. That these lengths are worth going to can be \nrelated to the likely cost of templates and their efficient use as well as the ready accessibility of the \nimprint sites. The same considerations equally apply to the imprinting of epitopes as to whole \nproteins, the templates may also be expensive and\/or available in small amounts and the target is still \n31 \n \na bulky protein molecule (See Figure 7). An interesting strategy for the imprinting of peptides at \nsurfaces was reported by Titirici et al.\n129\n using solid-phase synthesis on a porous silica bead to \nproduce the template peptide in situ, before the imprinting polymerisation was carried out in the pores \nof the silica. Etching away the macro-template (silica bead) gave (negative) replicas of the pore \nstructure of the template particle with surface accessible imprint sites. The imprints were shown to be \ncapable of binding larger peptides with the same terminal sequence as the template peptide \n(epitope).\n130\n This method is a development of that shown for small molecules\n131,132\n and is also similar \nin concept to the nanowire method, shown in Figure 8. \n \nWhen considering the pros and cons of bulk vs. surface imprinting methods, the following should be \nconsidered: Bulk imprinting is a fairly simple approach compared to surface-imprinting methods, \nwhich may require much more complex preparation procedures. Bulk methods are inefficient in their \nuse of potentially expensive templates, whereas surface-confined templates may be used more \nefficiently and, although as yet largely unproven, could possibly enable template reuse though a \nnumber of imprinting cycles. Template removal should be much easier to achieve in surface-confined \nimprinting, providing good access to the imprinted sites, whereas MIPs prepared in bulk may suffer \nfrom poor template extraction, slow binding kinetics and template entrapment and\/or bleeding. \nSurface methods may also offer lower non-specific binding but ultimately the number of binding sites \ncreated will be limited by the amount of surface available. Whether this would prove to be a limitation \nwill depend on the ultimate application of the material and (for a sensor) the signal transduction \nmethod used. \n \n \n32 \n \n \nFigure 8.

Adapted \nfrom Ouyang et al.\n128\n \n \n2.4 Environmental factors \n \nFor the imprinting of whole protein, careful control over pH and salt concentration may be required to \npreserve the native conformation of the template protein and control the charge state of the protein. \nSuch precise control may not be necessary for epitope imprinting however, depending on the \nfunctionality of the constituent amino acids and indeed whether aqueous or non-aqueous \npolymerisation conditions are utilised.  \n \nUysal and co-workers\n135\n prepared haemoglobin-imprinted polymers at different pH (4.0, 6.8 and 8.0) \nto study the effect of pH on the imprinting process. They used t-butylacrylamide, acrylamide and \nitaconic acid (ITA) as functional monomer. It was found that the greatest binding for the template \nprotein was shown by the polymer imprinted at pH 4.0, below the isoelectric point of the template, (pI \n= 6.8) where the protein carried a net positive charge, enabling its interaction with the negatively \ncharged ITA residues. \n \n3 Polymer selection \nThe recognition properties of MIPs are highly dependent on the quality of the binding sites contained \nin the matrix and this applies equally to MIPs imprinted with proteins. Key factors governing the \nquality of the imprinted cavities are the choice of monomers and cross-linkers as well as their \namounts. The following sections describe strategies for monomer selection and survey of a number of \n34 \n \nrecent papers showing the diversity of compositions used to imprint proteins and other biological \ntargets. This is followed by a consideration of the cross-linkers used in the imprinting of proteins. \n \n3.1 Choice of functional monomer \nThere are many monomers available for interaction with template functionality and in general their \nselection can be made by selection, based on chemical intuition according to the structure of the \ntemplate, or on the basis of molecular motifs for which designed small molecule receptors have been \npublished.\n136-138\n Alternatively a rational selection can be made, either using a combinatorial \n(experimental) approach,\n23,24\n a chemometric experimental design\n24\n or by computational methods.\n26,139-\n142\n In the combinatorial and chemometric approaches libraries of MIPs with different compositions are \nprepared, either as a comprehensive (combinatorial) or representative (chemometric) set, varying \nparameters such as functional monomer, monomer-template ratio, solvent, cross-linker etc. Evaluation \nof the polymer properties, such as extent of binding of the template, can be made using semi-\nautomated approaches. Computational methods however use computer modelling in an attempt to \npredict the locations and strength of the interactions of monomer with template. Selection of which \nmonomer to use can then be based on criteria such as binding energies and number of points of \ninteraction. Selection of monomers for protein imprinting, however, is complicated by factors which \ndo not apply when small molecules are to be imprinted. Firstly, as most proteins are not soluble in \nnon-polar or medium polarity solvents, only monomers which are soluble in polar solvents (ideally \nwater) can be selected. Even when the protein target can be dissolved in an organic solvent, it would \nbe unwise to use it the production of MIPs, since biomolecules are highly likely to undergo \nconformational changes\n143\n such that the resulting imprint will not be representative of the native \nprotein target in aqueous solution, where the sensor is most likely to be required to perform. \nDisregarding monomers soluble in apolar organic solvents, many of the remaining monomers of the \nfunctional monomer \u201cpool\u201d contain ionisable groups (strong acids and bases). Whether polymers \ncontaining these highly charged monomers are helpful in the imprinting of proteins has been of some \n35 \n \ndebate. In fact whereas, relatively strong non-covalent interactions can arise from electrostatic \ninteraction of opposing charges on polymer and template, a net positive or negative charge on the \npolymer can also lead to high levels of non-specific interaction for all species carrying the opposite \ncharge, since many of the charged monomers will be randomly distributed over the polymer surface, \nas well as being specifically located in the imprinted sites. This situation is generally incompatible \nwith cases where the target protein must be detected from a mixture of similar molecules, as is usually \nthe case for biomedical use. In fact smaller charged species, such as physiological salts and buffers \ncould interfere with recognition based largely on charge. For these reasons the majority of successful \nprotein imprinting experiments have used neutral, water soluble monomers such as acrylamide and its \nderivatives or other neutral monomeric species (see Table 3). \n \nTable 3.

These can \nbe roughly divided into: acrylic monomers, such as acrylamide, used to produce polymers, either in \nwater (e.g. hydrogels) or in organic solvents; silane-based monomers, to create sol-gels, organically-\n39 \n \nmodified silicas (ORMOSILs) and related materials; monomers such as 3-aminophenyl boronic acid, \nused to make imprinted polyaniline; and thiol derivatives and surfactants used in the formation of \u201c2-\nD\u201d imprints at interfaces or on gold surfaces, the latter mainly for sensor applications. The majority of \nthe monomers used are either neutral compounds or weak acids or bases, which will be uncharged \nover a relatively wide pH range.  There are relatively few examples (marked with a star in the table) \nwhere monomers that are likely to be significantly charged at neutral pH, were used for imprinting.  \n \nJaniak et al.,\n196\n recently looked at the effect of charge density on the recognition properties of \nmolecularly imprinted hydrogels, prepared using either positively or negatively charged monomers \n(3-methacrylamido propyltrimethyl ammonium or 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid) \nrespectively. The gels showed a decrease in recognition ability with increasing charge density, which \nalso affected the swelling behaviour of the gels. The authors also showed that surfactants, generally \nemployed in the template removal process, were responsible for some of the binding interactions seen. \n \nOu et al.\n187\n have shown that when hydrogels (polyacrylamide materials produced in aqueous \nenvironments) imprinted with lysozyme were prepared using acrylamide as the only monomer, the \nprotein molecules were partially incorporated through covalent bonding to the polymer matrix, \noccurring during the polymerisation, and could not be removed. This limited the number of \nrecognition sites available for specifically rebinding the template. This phenomenon could be reduced, \nhowever, by the inclusion of methacrylic acid into the hydrogel compositions. This was attributed to \nthe acidic monomer interacting through electrostatic forces with groups on the protein responsible for \nformation of covalent bonds, making them unavailable to attack by radicals during polymerisation. \nChen et al.\n163\n also used a small amount of methacrylic acid as copolymer, alongside N-\nisopropylacrylamide as the major functional monomer, in order to synthesise hydrogels specific for \nlysozyme and cytochrome C. Matsunaga et al.\n203\n similarly produced lysozyme-imprinted hydrogels \nfilms on a sensor surface using an acidic monomer, acrylic acid. In addition to the acidic monomer, \n40 \n \nthe zwitterionic monomer, 2-methacryloylethyl phosphorylcholine, was included in their polymer \ncomposition in order to reduce non-specific binding to the hydrogels. The same group\n212\n investigated \nthe role of acrylic acid in the imprinting of lysozyme on the surface of silica beads using acrylamide \nand N,N-methylene-bis-acrylamide based polymers. They concluded that a ratio of 5:1, \nacrylamide:lysozyme was optimal and that in the absence of acrylic acid there was no binding \nspecificity in the polymers, whereas too much of the monomer gave rise to high non-specific binding. \nOn the other hand Zhang et al.\n190\n were able to produce MIPs for lysozyme using only a mixture of \nacrylamide and acryloyl-\uf062-cyclodextrin, another neutral monomer. The authors managed to avoid the \nproblem of lysozyme incorporation into the matrix by covalently immobilising the template onto \nsilica beads, making it less available to radical attack. The material synthesised by Zhang and \ncolleagues showed high specificity and excellent selectivity for rebinding of the template with respect \nto other proteins (cytochrome C, BSA, avidin and methylated bovine serum albumin).  \nAnother study that lends weight to the proposition that acrylamide (usually with methylene-bis-\nacrylamide as cross-linker) is the monomer of choice for protein imprinting, is that reported by the \ngroup of Ulbricht.\n213\n They showed that highly cross-linked layers of polyacrylamide grafted on \nsensors, strongly reduces the adsorption of protein (BSA) compared to bare sensor surfaces, making \nthis material very promising for the development of sensors for protein detection.  \nTuran et al.\n195\n produced hydrogels with specificity for myoglobin, prepared using N-\nisopropylacrylamide along with the strongly acidic monomer, 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-propanesulfonic \nacid (AMPSA) as the functional co-monomer. Although the authors showed that this composition \nproduces selective hydrogels in model solutions, it would been interesting to see the behaviour of \ntheir material in a complex biological fluid. This would make it possible to assess whether the \npresence of negative charges, due to the presence of AMPSA, would lead to high levels of non-\nspecific binding. \nOther examples, cited in Table 3, involving the use of charged monomers, are those in which surface \nimprinted layers, thin films or self-assembled monolayers (SAMS) have been prepared. These can \n41 \n \ngenerally be classed as 2-dimensional or 2-D MIPs. In these 2-D MIPs, non specific binding, which \ncan result from the presence of charges generally distributed over the surface of porous polymer \nparticles, is minimised by limiting the amount of available surface. Molecularly imprinted films \nspecific for creatine kinase and ovalbumin were made by \u201emicro-contact imprinting\u201f by the group of \nChou\n188,189\n using methacrylic acid as monomer. These molecularly imprinted films were able to \nmaintain their recognition capabilities even when tested in undiluted serum. Tai et al.\n121,160,161\n \nproduced MIP films based on a mixture of acrylamide and acrylic acid for a variety of targets onto \nquartz crystal microbalance sensors. These examples have therefore shown that for sensor \napplications, where 2-D MIPs films are used for the recognition of target analytes, using acrylamide \nas the principal functional monomer, accompanied by a small amount of a strongly basic or acidic co-\nmonomer, can produce better sensing materials. The implication is that combinatorial approaches and \ncomputational modelling can also be used in the design of polymer compositions for protein \nimprinting, as well as for small molecule targets, to help in the selection of the \u201cbest co-monomer\u201d for \na specific target protein (or peptide). \nFor completeness some of the more unusual systems reported for protein imprinted should be \nmentioned here. The first is the use of so-called \u201cassistant recognition polymer chains\u201d (ARPCs), used \nin the imprinting of BSA\n210,211\n and cloned pig cyclophilin 18.\n214\n These are poly(vinyl alcohol) chains \nmodified, with polar functional groups and double bonds, which are allowed to interact with the target \nprotein before being immobilised onto the surface of a macroporous adsorbent sphere through a \npolymerisation process. The use of a range of ARPC structures allows a selection of the best binding \nchains on the basis of competition before polymerisation. Another unusual approach is the \nphotochemically-induced templating of proteins into a polymer bearing cis-trans photoisomerisable \nazobenzene side-chains.\n215\n Irradiation of the polymer in the presence of proteins,\n215-217\n viruses\n218\n or \npolymer beads\n215\n causes the polymer to deform as it undergoes repeated photoactivated \nconformational changes, resulting in immobilisation of proteins and\/or the formation of photo-\nimprints. While scientifically interesting, the system is unlikely to be relevant to sensor construction \nas the polymers remain photo-active after template removal and would therefore be prone to \u201cerasure\u201d \n42 \n \nof the imprints through stray light activation. The final system worth mentioning is the \u201cantibody \nreplicas\u201d prepared by the group of Dickert.219,220 In this case imprints of antibodies for a specific target \nwere prepared in particles of poly(vinylpyrrolidone-co-methacrylic acid) crosslinked with N,N\u201f-(1,2-\ndihydroxyethylene)-bisacrylamide. The antibody-imprinted particles were used as a stamp in the \nformation of a secondary imprint as a polymer layer on the surface of a sensor chip. Remarkably the \nplastic replica antibodies were claimed to show improved selectivity and sensitivity on quartz crystal \nmicrobalance sensors when compared to their natural counterparts (the original templates).\n219\n This \napproach has the advantage that potentially many copies of the antibody replicas can be prepared, \nhowever it suffers from the disadvantage that antibodies must first be prepared as the template \nspecies, which tends to negate many of the attractions of using imprinting in the first place, in \nparticular dispensing with the need to use laboratory animals and\/or expensive and time-consuming \nbiological processing. Clearly this approach is relevant to sensor preparation, but at the moment is a \ncuriosity. \n \n3.2 Cross-linkers and cross-linking \nThere are two principal approaches to protein imprinting, either the use of a relatively high degree of \ncross-linking to make rigid or semi-rigid polymeric materials or to use lower amounts of cross-linking \nagent to prepare soft hydrogel materials that need to remain hydrated to retain memory for the \ntemplate. A compromise situation can arise when grafting low cross-linked polymer to a solid \nsupport, such as a porous membrane, since this adds a local degree of order at the interface, \nmaintaining the structure more efficiently than an unsupported soft gel.  \n \nFor sensing purposes, soft hydrogels are unlikely to be practicable, since they require constant \nhydration and are readily damaged. Byrne and Salian recently reviewed the area of protein imprinting \nin hydrogel polymers.\n221\n The authors predict a rapid rise in the number of publication in imprinted \n43 \n \nhydrogels, based on current trends, although there are clearly some problems associated with working \nwith soft gel materials. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 9. Structures of some of the cross-linkers mentioned in this section: MBA: methylene-bis-\nacrylamide; EBA: ethylene-bis-acrylamide; BAP: bis-acryloylpiperazine; EGDMA: ethyleneglycol \ndimethacrylate; NOBE: N,O,-bis-methacryloyl ethanolamine; TEGDMA: tetraethylene glycol \ndimethacrylate. \n \nFor aqueous-based polymerisation there are relatively few compounds available for use as cross-\nlinker, the principal candidates are: methylene-bis-acrylamide (MBA), ethylene-bis-acrylamide \n(EBA) and N,N\u201f-bis-acryloylpiperazine (BAP).  \n \n44 \n \nMBA is commonly used in the cross-linking of polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis applications \nand has been used, for example in the \u201cgel antibodies\u201d of Hjert\u00e9n.103 The monomer performs well as \nan aqueous-compatible cross-linker but suffers from relatively poor solubility, preventing one from \nachieving relatively high levels of cross-linking when used alone. EBA is more soluble in water and \nBAP has an even higher solubility. \n \nBurow and Minoura\n101\n used MBA in combination with N,N\u201f-1,2-dihydroxyethylene-bis(acrylamide) \nin the imprinting of glucose oxidase on the surface of silica beads. EBA was used as the cross-linker \nin the work of Nishino\n117\n on epitope imprinting at a surface layer. The cross-linker was used at the \nlevel of 10%, and polyethylene glycol 200-diacrylate was also added at the level of 0.1 mol%.  El \nKirat and co-workers\n154\n compared the binding capacity and specificity of a number of cytochrome c \nimprinted polymers, prepared using a range of cross-linkers, including MBA, EBA and BAP. The \noptimum varied for each cross-linker studied, but was in the range of 3.3 to 6.6% in each case. The \nhighest binding was seen in the case of 6.6% EBA, which also showed reasonably low non-specific \nbinding. \n \nLin et al.\n199\n based the selection of cross-linker in their work on the microcontact imprinting of \nmyoglobin by finding the cross-linker with the least affinity for their template. On this basis \ntetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) was chosen as cross-linker. Methyl methacrylate was \nchosen as functional monomer and the MIP showed excellent specificity and good selectivity for the \ntemplate.  \n \nIn organic solvents, the cross-linker of choice is usually ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) \nalthough the use of hybrid cross-linkers\n222\n is an interesting option. In particular N,O-bis-methacryloyl \nethanolamine (NOBE)\n223\n has proved useful in the preparation of OMNiMIPs (one monomer \n45 \n \nmolecularly imprinted polymers),\n224\n which have shown good performance in the enantioselective \nimprinting of amino acid derivatives and other chiral templates.\n225\n More recently this approach was \nshown to give specific recognition materials for peptides, indicating that NOBE may be useful for \napplications in epitope imprinting for binding larger protein targets.\n226\n  \n4 Polymer preparation \nThe choice of thermal or photochemical polymerisation conditions may be dictated by the polymer \nformat. For example surface grafting, which is preferable for sensor applications, is often \nconveniently carried out by photochemically-activated graft polymerisation, using surface-bound \ninitiators. While high temperatures can be reached inside bulk polymerisations,\n227\n which would be \ndamaging to protein templates, this should not be the case with thin polymer films where the heat can \nbe more efficiently dissipated. The polymerisation time and initiator concentration can be optimised \nby experiment, although low initiator concentrations and longer polymerisation times have been \nshown to be beneficial in the imprinting of low molar mass compounds.\n228\n  \nOnce polymerisation is complete the template molecule (the protein or peptide) must be extracted \nwith a suitable solvent in order to allow the specific recognition sites created by the imprinting \nprocess to be available for binding. The washing conditions used for template removal need to be \ncarefully selected in order to preserve the integrity of the imprint sites, while removing as much \ntemplate as possible. Mildly acidic and\/or basic solutions, as well as various surfactants and \nenzymatic digestion methods have been employed for the removal of protein templates. Mildly basic \nconditions (a solution of NaOH\/NaClO (0.5\/1.0%) for 0.5-2 h) were used by Shi et al.\n124\n to dissolve \nand extract the protein templates from a disaccharide-based MIP layer. Successful rebinding of the \ntemplate proteins suggested that indeed the mild washing solution succeeded in freeing specific \nbinding sites without any damage. Janiak et al.\n196\n pointed out that surfactants, also widely used for \ntemplate removal, in addition to washing out the template molecule, can be responsible for some of \nthe binding properties attributed to imprinting. This also highlights the need for careful use of controls \nwhen interpreting binding to specific interactions with MIPs. Protein digestion approaches, using \n46 \n \nenzymes such as pronase\n113\n or trypsin,\n150\n run the risk of leaving template fragments attached to the \npolymer. The use of enzymes, even those that are relatively small proteins, also means that some \ntemplate will be inaccessible to the removal agent, especially if MIPs are in a \u201cbulk\u201d or 3-dimensional \nformat. This should be less of an issue for very thin (2-D) MIP layers. Surface imprinting approaches, \nsuch as the microcontact printing method, can simplify template removal, since most is peeled away \nwith the substrate used to present the templates to the polymerisation mixture.  \nRegeneration of the imprint sites after a binding event involves very similar issues to those concerned \nwith template removal. If the MIPs are to be used in reusable sensors, an efficient regeneration step \nwill be required. In many practical applications of sensors (e.g. for medical use) a disposable (one-\nshot) system would be preferable, both for operational and safety reasons. In this case how to \nregenerate the MIP would no longer be an issue.  \nA fundamental feature of a successful sensor is its selectivity: insufficient selectivity can lead to false \nnegatives. In the case of MIP-based sensors the imprinting approach must be selected so as to \nmaximise selectivity. In protein recognition, selectivity impinges on the ability of the MIP sensor to \nrecognise only the target protein or a protein family. In practical terms, this means that the affinity of \nthe polymer for the target must be considerably greater than for any non-target protein. Despite the \nnumerous examples reported in the literature, in our opinion, it will be highly unlikely that sufficient \nselectivity would be achieved using a whole protein approach. Probably the best way to ensure a high \ndegree of selectivity is to prepare MIPs for use in biosensors using the epitope approach,\n57,114-116\n as \ndescribed above. In this case maximum selectivity in binding can be achieved through selection of a \npeptide epitope of sufficient length such that it is as close as possible to being a unique identifier of \nthe target protein as possible, within the bounds of probability; but not so long that binding will be \nsterically hindered or require considerable reorganisation of the protein structure.  \nWhereas high selectivity avoids false negatives, a high specificity (or low non-specific binding to the \nnon-imprinted regions of the transducer coating) will avoid false positives. The specificity will \ntherefore depend on the exposed surface area of the polymer, its functionality and surface charge, \n47 \n \namong other factors. As it has been already explained above, it is suggested that the avoidance of \ncharged monomers (and initiator) might help in reducing non-specific interactions. This also applies \nto the use of charged surfactants for the removal of template. A dense array of epitope-imprinted sites, \nas described by Nishino et al.\n117\n is also to be recommended. \n4.1. Polymer format for sensing applications \nThe format of the polymer used in protein imprinting is usually dictated by the method of \npolymerisation and how the template is presented (surface or interfacial imprinting approaches) or the \napplication (surface-grafted films on transducer surfaces or beads for chromatographic separations). \nSeveral examples of surface-grafted protein imprinting films are reported in the literature, where \neither the protein or the peptide, representing part of the protein (epitope approach), are mixed with \nmonomers and in some cases also with a cross-linker (e.g. N,N-methylene-bis-acrylamide) and \npolymerised in situ to form grafted films on transducer surfaces or on supporting particles. Different \ntype of monomers have been used for this type of surface-grafted sensor and among the most common \nare: thiol derivatives;\n164,165\n silane derivatives;\n53,126,182,184,185\n  boronic acid;\n157,166,167,170\n and acrylics such \nas acrylamide or N-isopropylacrylamide.\n121,154-156,160,162,180,203\n  \nSurface-constrained templates, as required by contact imprinting\n127,189,199\n and surface confined epitope \napproaches\n117\n are probably the most readily adapted to incorporation with transducer surfaces. In \nthese cases a planar thin film results from a casting process, polymer-forming components being \nconfined as a thin film between surfaces, one treated to bind to the polymer (corresponding to the \ntransducer surface) and the other, bearing the template structure, allowing easy release. \nBulk materials are the least suitable for sensor development, since ground and irregular particles are \ndifficult to immobilise on transducers, resulting in an uneven distribution of imprinted sites over the \ntransducer surface and poor connectivity between polymer binding and the transduction mechanism. \nA compromise between \u201cbulk imprinting\u201d and \u201csurface imprinting\u201d can come from the \nimmobilisation of spherical particles, which can be surface-imprinted, onto the transducer surface. In \nparticular, nanoparticles would allow for more efficient receptor immobilisation and they can be \n48 \n \nprocessed as if they were the plastic equivalent of antibodies. The analogy with antibodies can even \nextend to the use of affinity-based methods for the selection of fractions with the highest binding \naffinity and gel permeation chromatography to select particle fractions with a selected size \ndistribution.\n37\n There are also methods for the preparation of surface-confined whole protein binding \nsites on microparticle beads, used as supports.\n126,134\n An alternative approach is to imprint the protein \nat the interface in mini-emulsion polymerisation.\n204,205\n \nOther particle-based approaches include the deposition of thin shell layers over core particles, which \nensure that the imprint sites (which resemble bulk imprints) remain within close proximity to the \nsurface.\n155,166\n Particle-based approaches to protein imprinting have been reviewed by Tan and Tong.\n229\n \nThe incorporation of particles of larger sizes with transducer surfaces will still involve some of the \ndifficulties inherent with bulk polymers, nanoparticles, particularly soluble nanogels, however, could \nbe treated as if they were biological molecules to some extent, for which many methods of transducer \nintegration are known. \n \n5 Signal transduction \n \nWhen a protein template binds to its imprinted polymer the resulting physical and chemical changes \ncan be exploited to measure the event, i.e. signal transduction. The transducer can either be an \nexternal component added to the system to monitor binding, for example an electrochemical tag, or \ncan be integrated as part of the polymer matrix. Integrated transducer systems allow reagentless \nsensing. Reagentless sensing is a current driver in sensing technology due to the decreased time to \nresult, reduced assay complexity and fewer steps associated with generating a signal. Here we \ndescribe sensor techniques using either polymers prepared on planar surfaces, as shells over \nnanoparticle cores, or synthesised as nanoparticles. Such preparations are favourable for use in \nsensing as the binding element can be efficiently coupled to the transducing element, and there is an \n49 \n \nadequate number of binding sites exposed on the polymer surface, resulting in improved sensitivity \nand response time. \nA significant advantage of MIPs over biologically-derived affinity agents are their long-term stability, \nrelative insensitivity to harsh reagents and the ability to measure multiple \u201crepeated\u201d binding \nreactions. The continuous detection of analytes over prolonged periods and in a reagentless system is \nan obvious application for MIPs and has been exploited to detect the pesticide carbaryl in water (\uf0b3 \n200 binding cycles with good assay stability for at least 4 months) using the native fluorescence of the \nanalyte.\n230\n We will focus this discussion on signal transduction mechanisms that can be applied to \nreagentless sensing, however where sensitivity is a major issue an external transducer, or competition \nassay (e.g. for ribonuclease A\n231\n), can be used to amplify the signal, improving the limit of detection.  \nVarious reviews of MIP signal transduction mechanisms have been published,\n232\n however many of \nthese methods are for small molecules and depend on specific chemical functionalities for signal \ntransduction that are not applicable to general protein analysis. These transduction techniques include; \nelectrochemical, fluorescent quenching, IR and Raman spectroscopy. Unless the protein template \ncontains an electro-active moiety, metal complex, or is intrinsically fluorescent (aromatic fluorescence \nis not suitable due to strong background and low quantum efficiency), reagentless protein detection \ntransduction systems would appear to be limited. These include optical, or acoustic measurement of \nchanges in the polymer thickness, refractive index, bulk properties, or swelling upon binding; or \nelectrical changes at, or within the polymer upon binding, that can result in: shielding, or re-\norganisation of the polymers within the MIP layer, a change in the dielectric constant, or in charge \ndistribution at the electrode. \n5.1 Signal transduction using polymers \nPolymers can be either selected, or designed to incorporate the transducing element of the sensor, \nthereby limiting the need for additional sensor components. For many of the electrical and \nelectrochemical techniques described, the use of conducting polymers\n233\n within the MIP \npolymerization reaction is required. The intrinsic conduction of a polymer is apparent upon oxidation, \n50 \n \nor reduction \u201edoping\u201f of the conjugated backbone. Doping can also change the optical properties of \nthe conducting polymer in the UV-vis and NIR regions leading to new applications for optical \nsensing. Such conducting polymers are also influenced by protonation\/deprotonation and \nconformational changes in the receptor\/sensor layer that alter ion diffusion and therefore conducting \nproperties.  \n \nLibraries of polymers used for selection and modelling will therefore be biased to include a proportion \nof conducting polymers for electrical\/electrochemical sensors.  Conducting polymers that have \npreviously been used in the development of imprinted receptors include: polypyrrole, polyaniline and \nbenzophenone. The application, use and incorporation of conducting polymers in electrochemical \nsensors has been reviewed.\n234\n Energy transfer associated with conducting polymers can also be used \nas the basis for fluorescence-based sensors. Fluorescent mechanisms that have been used in MIP-\nbased sensors include; photo-induced electronic transfer (PET), replacement of coordinating ligands, \nchanges in rigidity, complexation and alteration of quenching efficiency. Unless significant changes \nin fluorescent quenching are observed, the background signal from unbound conducting polymers will \nreduce the sensitivity of the assay, potentially limiting its use for protein analysis. \n \n5.2 Electrical and electrochemical sensors  \nElectrochemical techniques relevant to sensing include; voltammetry and amperometry, potentiometry \nand impedometry transduction methods. These techniques have been used in the development of MIP-\nbased sensors, with the majority of examples involving the detection of small molecule electro-active \nanalytes,\n235,236\n as opposed to proteins. However notable examples include: an immunosensor-based \ndetection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) through oxidation of Trp and Tyr residues;\n237\n a MIP \nsensor for chiral amino acid recognition that could be adapted for proteins\n201\n  and a potentiometric \nsensor for selective detection of either myoglobin or haemoglobin in complex protein mixtures.\n164\n The \npotentiometric sensor displayed protein detection in the low \uf06dg\/ml range and specificity when \n51 \n \ncompared to proteins of similar size and charge. Binding of charged protein to an insulating layer of \nMIP over an electrode alters the surface potential, allowing binding to be measured \npotentiometrically.\n164\n The sensor response depends on the isoelectric point of the protein and the pH \nof the sample matrix, however this dependency may be exploited to enhance specificity.      \nCapacitance\/Impedance sensors can detect analyte binding to imprinted polymers through changes in \nthe thickness, and\/or dielectric constant of the insulating layer.\n238,239\n Polymers used for imprinting in \ncapacitive sensors include those prepared from; phenol, MBA, AMPSA and o-phenylenediamine). \nThere are limited examples of MIP-based capacitance sensors for protein analytes, however an \nimmunosensor for detection of cancer antigen 125 was shown to display good sensitivity, dynamic \nrange and the ability to perform repeated measurement using diluted serum samples, when compared \nwith SPR and conventional ELISA.\n240\n Additional small molecule sensor data and macromolecule \nstudies suggest capacitance can be applied for sensitive protein detection. \nImpedance-based spectroscopy has been used to detect a virus binding to MIPs,\n241\n and therefore could \nbe employed to detect specific proteins associated with organisms, or larger complexes. An \ninterdigitated electrode-based capacitor was used to monitor changes in the dielectric properties of the \nMIPs (co-polymer of methacrylic acid and N-vinyl pyrrolidone) occurring upon binding the virus. The \nresulting reusable sensor facilitates continuous, rapid monitoring of complex biological samples, \nalbeit with lower detection limits when compared with ELISA. \nCapacitance-based sensors can be prepared inexpensively in bulk using, for example, field-effect \ntransistor (FET) technology. Multi-analyte detection can be facilitated by the use of interdigitated \nelectrode-based capacitors, making this a flexible technique for protein detection. However other \ntechniques, notably optical and electrochemical sensing, offer better sensitivity and specificity as \nvarious analytes can interfere with the polymer layer.  \n \n5.3 Optical and Acoustic Sensors \n52 \n \nOptical and acoustic sensors that essentially measure changes in the mass of the sensing layer, or \nchanges in the refractive index at a surface are both suited to protein analysis. The majority of \npublished articles involving the detection of protein- or cell-based analytes use the quartz crystal \nmicrobalance (QCM), (acoustic) or surface plasmon resonance (SPR), (optical) sensor platforms, due \nto the sensitivity achievable with these techniques compared to other methods. An additional bonus \narising from using these planar transducers is the relative ease of preparing MIPs on their surfaces. \nQuartz crystal microbalances use a thin disc of quartz, cut at a specific crystal plane, sandwiched \nbetween a pair of (usually gold) electrodes as the transducer. The piezoelectric crystal oscillates at \nMHz frequencies when an electric field is applied to the crystal. Materials that are acoustically \ncoupled to the sensor surface, i.e. due to binding rather than proximity, are detected through changes \nin the oscillation frequency. This offers an advantage over other sensors that measure bulk changes in \nrefractive index. In QCM the change in resonance frequency is proportional to the mass of molecules \nbound to the surface. Ligand binding events that alter the conformation or the rigidity of the imprinted \npolymer layer can significantly enhance the resulting signal and can be analysed independently as \nshear modulus, viscosity or density changes. The use of piezoelectric sensors to detect low-molecular \nweight analytes, employing MIPs immobilised to the gold electrodes, has been reviewed.\n242\n A MIP-\nbased QCM sensor has been developed for the detection of anthrax protective antigen.\n160\n The sensor \ndisplayed excellent sensitivity, in the picomolar range, however limited data about specificity and the \ninfluence of potential interferences was provided, therefore the long term applications of this sensor \nformat cannot be assessed. Other examples of protein analytes detected using QCM include native \ntrypsin (reported detection limit 100 ng\/ml),\n243\n micro albumin in clinical samples\n244\n and \uf062-\nlactoglobulin.\n172\n QCM provides a flexible technique to measure protein analytes through changes to \nthe mass and physicochemical properties of the polymer-sensing surface. The need for acoustic \ncoupling to the sensor surface and the relative mass measurement makes this technique less prone to \ninterferences. QCM instruments can be adapted for continuous sensing, for prolonged periods as \nhighlighted by the on-line detection of pesticides.\n245\n \n53 \n \nThe SPR phenomenon requires that the recognition element be coupled to a metallic surface (typically \nsilver or gold), or to nanoparticle \u201cisland\u201d substrates. The use of SPR in biosensing has been \nreviewed.\n246\n In brief, SPR is sensitive to changes in the refractive index of the sensor layer (to a \ndistance of around 1000 nm), as a result of analyte binding gives rise to distinct detection modes; \nincluding changes in intensity and a shift in the SPR angle. Examples of protein analytes detected \nusing SPR sensors include lysozyme\n203\n and Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb).\n194\n HbsAb is a \nbiomarker for asymptomatic HBV infection. It was shown that HbsAb can be detected using a 2-\nhydroxyethyl methacrylate, N-methacryloyl-L-tyrosine methyl ester-based MIP in diluted serum from \npatients. A significant issue associated with long-term measurements with MIPs in biological \nmatrices, is fouling by non-specific protein adsorption, however the authors report that the SPR sensor \nhas a significant resistance to this biofouling. Albeit for a limited number of samples, a good \nrelationship was observed between the MIP-based SPR assay and a commercially available \nimmunoassay.\n194\n SPR technology has previously required expensive optical equipment not suited for \nsensing purposes. However recent advances in the availability of low-cost sensing devices have made \nSPR more portable and economically viable for general sensoring requirements.  \nChanges in the flexibility and swelling of polymers associated with ligand binding can be exploited to \nmeasure proteins, albeit with low sensitivity. An example is the detection of BSA, at the level of 1 \nmg\/ml, through changes in the Bragg shift of imprinted polymer-based photonic crystals.\n198,247,248\n \nVarious optical formats exist to measure ligand-induced changes in swollen polymers and hydrogels, \nhowever these methods are very sensitive to changes in buffer composition, e.g. pH and ionic \nstrength, limiting the potential use of such technology in protein sensing.  \n \n5.4 Nanotechnology \nThe use of nanoparticles, either prepared on a substrate or in solution, can be applied to MIP-based \nbiosensors through adaptation of the transduction routes described above, or through novel \nmechanisms. The techniques and examples given are mainly based on the detection of small \n54 \n \nmolecules, or immunosensor technology, both of which could be applied to the sensing of proteins or \npeptides using MIP technology. Nanoparticles offer many advantages in MIP-based sensing \nincluding: improved signal sensitivity, increased sensor surface area (making removal of the template \neasier) and novel signal transduction mechanisms.\n249,250\n Gold nanoparticle aggregation is routinely \nused in lateral flow devices, which highlights that such technology can be readily adapted to \ninexpensive and disposable platforms for diagnostic applications.  \nCompared to planar surfaces, nanostructures can be engineered with high surface to volume ratios, \nincreasing the number and ratio of imprinted sites that are accessible for binding, and therefore \nbinding capacity of the MIP. The grafting of MIPs to the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs),\n251,252\n to \nenhance the surface area of electrochemical\n253,254\n or electrical transducers has been described. An \nexample is the CNT nanoarray, coated with a caffeine-imprinted polypyrrole layer, for which a 15-\nfold increase in sensitivity was reported, compared to similarly imprinted planar surfaces. \n251\n An \nelectrochemical sensor, using TNT-imprinted Au nanoparticles has been used for the sensitive \ndetection of the template, with a reported limit of detection of 46 ppt, (~200 pM).\n255\n Silver \nnanoparticles have been used to enhance electron transfer in a MIP-based amperometric sensor for the \ninsecticide, dimethoate.\n256\n Improvements in the effective receptor surface area could be considered \nmore significant for the sensing of large molecules, such as proteins, where mass transfer to the \nsurface and limited diffusion into deep polymer layer play an important role in binding kinetics.  \nNanoparticles can be used to increase the effective surface area of a sensor surface. Examples include \nthe use of gold colloids, directly immobilised to a polymer surface, in an immuno-capacitance \nsensor\n257\n and an electric tunnelling assay,\n258\n both for the detection of cholera toxin. The excellent \nsensitivity obtained in these assays and the ability to measure in diluted samples suggests these \nsensors could be adapted for MIP-based sensing. \nMIP nanoparticles can either be prepared directly, for example by microemulsion polymerisation or \nby depositing a shell of polymer over a pre-formed nanoparticle, such as for example quantum dots \n(QDs), or gold colloids. Many of the advantages of using either core-shell nanoparticles, or \n55 \n \nnanostructured surfaces with MIP\u201fs will only be apparent if the polymer layer can be prepared \nsufficiently thin and with a regular thickness. A QCM sensor for the detection of the binding of \nimprinted polymer nanoparticles to the peptide melittin, immobilised on the QCM chip has been \nreported.\n38\n In this format the MIP-nanoparticle behaved similarly to antibodies using in \nimmunoassays, showing the validity of this approach for sensing applications. \nNanoparticles bearing surface-confined peptide imprints prepared by inverse microemulsion \npolymerisation were similarly shown to bind to peptide targets immobilised on QCM chips.\n259\n The \nnanoparticles were prepared with a hydrophobic \u201ctail\u201d in order to confine them at the water-in-oil \ninterface and engineer the imprint sites to accept the target peptide in only one orientation. The ability \nto selectively bind from only one terminus of the peptide sequence facilitates protein detection by \nproviding more uniform imprints which can target a specific protein chain terminus. The resulting \nMIP nanoparticles bound the target peptide, melittin, with dissociation constants in the range 90-900 \nnM. The nanoparticles were prepared from acrylamide and ethylene-bis-acrylamide as functional \nmonomer and cross-linker respectively. It would be possible to hydrophobically modify either end of \na peptide in order to select binding of either the exposed N- or C-terminus of the target protein. It \nwould be interesting to see whether peptides, hydrophobically modified at both ends, imprinted in the \nsame manner, would allow intra-protein sequences to be targeted, for example surface exposed loops. \nOther methods for the preparation of imprinted nanoparticles for sensor applications have been \ndescribed: polymer\n260\n and superparamagnetic particles,\n261,262\n Quantum dots\n43,176,263\n and \nnanowires.\n186,264,265\n The MIP nanoparticles described could be used in various assay formats and \ndevices, for example as detection (fluorescent, electrochemical), or capture\/separation agents \n(magnetic) in a sandwich complex, or in combination with other binding agents. \nLocalized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) can be obtained from metals, alloys or semiconductors, \nhowever most examples reported have involved either gold or silver. LSPR nanoparticles display \nscattering spectra whose peak wavelength depends on the particle composition, size, shape, \norientation and local dielectric environment.\n266\n The latter property can be exploited for biosensing \napplications. This has been demonstrated for the binding of conconavalin A to mannose-\n56 \n \nfunctionalized nanoparticles.\n267\n LSPR has been demonstrated for TNT imprinted gold nanoparticles, \ncross-linked and electropolymerized on a gold surface.\n255\n A detection limit of 10 fM was achieved, \nassociated with changes in the dielectric properties of the bis-aniline polymer upon the formation of a \n\uf070-donor-acceptor complex with the analyte. Nanoparticle islands of gold on a glass substrate were \nemployed for enhanced SPR, facilitated by plasmon coupling to gold nanoparticles embedded in a \ncholesterol-imprinted polymer film.\n268\n Re-binding of cholesterol led to a shift in the SPR angle. \nInterestingly the binding of structurally similar compounds led to smaller shifts, indicating an \nenhanced discrimination mode. A similar polymer swelling concept, using surface-enhanced Raman \nscattering (SERS) has been reported for adrenaline.\n269\n Assays of this type can be limited by slow \nprotein diffusion and interferences that alter polymer flexibility\/swelling. SERS from Au \nnanoparticles is a sensitive and specific sensor technique for the determination of compounds with \nunique Raman spectra, allowing for their detection within complex mixtures.\n270,271\n However the \nenhancement of protein, peptide, or specific amino acids is not as efficient and therefore has not been \nsignificantly exploited in sensor development. \n \nQDs embedded into polymer films have been reported to detect small molecules such as uracil, \ncaffeine\n272,273\n and guanosine.\n274\n Spectrally distinct QDs with a polymer shell imprinted with creatine, \nlysozyme and albumin were used for sensing in urine.\n176\n The QDs were mixed with the template and \npoly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) at different ratios to prepare the mixed QD\/MIP nanoparticles. \nSpecific binding of the template resulted in quenching of phosphorescence. The unique spectrum of \neach QD allowed for multiplexed analysis. However significant cross-reactivity for creatine with the \nlysozyme and albumin sites was observed. The authors presented data on rebinding, long-term \nstability and a limited comparison with a commercial clinical analyzer. The reported limits of \ndetection for albumin and lysozyme, ~ 900 and 200 ng\/ml respectively, compares favourably with \nother techniques, however the long-term stability of QDs and the limited fluorescent dynamic range of \nthe assay could limit the use of such sensors. \n57 \n \nA MIP-based sensor has been reported that detected dipicolinic acid (DPA),  a marker for bacterial \nendospores, through analyte-induced fluorescent quenching of gold-silver nanoclusters.\n275\n This sensor \nshould be more photostable than conventional fluorescent approaches, however the quenching \nmechanism may be specific to DPA, or other small acidic compounds and therefore not applicable to \nprotein-based sensing.  \n \nDynamic light scattering\n276\n and electrophoresis\n107-109\n can be used to detect changes in the physical \nproperties of nanoparticles (net charge and size) upon protein binding to an adsorbed receptor. \nPolyacrylamide microparticles imprinted with human haemoglobin were used to specifically detect \nthe template using free-zone electrophoresis in a revolving capillary.\n109\n \nOptical and acoustic techniques still dominate the literature for protein detection using MIPs, based on \nthe flexible nature of the techniques. However as advances in MIP development in relation to \nspecificity, re-binding and fouling of the polymer surface improve for protein analytes, it is expected \nthat more robust\/inexpensive techniques, for example conductance, will be required for \nremote\/continuous sensing, thereby realising the stability advantages that MIPs confer. We predict \nthat initially nanoparticles will have most impact in improving the sensitivity of current transduction \ntechniques through enhancements in effective surface area and electron transfer efficiency.  \n \n6 Conclusions and recommendations \nThe methods and techniques used in molecular imprinting cover a very broad canvas. This is \nespecially noticeable when considering methods of imprinting proteins, largely due to the additional \nconstraints involved in working with these challenging templates. In our opinion, the most successful \nstrategy for imprinting protein targets involves the use of small to medium peptides as the template, \nrepresenting an epitope of the target protein. So far the epitopes chosen have been linear peptides, \nidentical in sequence to one of the terminal peptide chains of the target protein; this however is a \nfairly narrow definition of epitope in terms of the regions of proteins recognised by antibodies. In this \n58 \n \ncase more diverse regions of the protein can be the target for antibody binding, whether strategies for \ndesigning epitope templates, that can be used to imprint recognition properties for surface regions or \nloops of the target, can ever be successfully devised remains to be seen. The problems of entrapment \nand covalent immobilisation of whole proteins suggests that only strategies aimed at surface \nimprinting, at interfaces or by stamping\/printing approaches, stand any chance of competing with \nthose based on epitope imprinting. As far as polymer systems are involved, soft hydrogels are \nprobably not recommended over more rigid systems for use in sensor applications. Nano-structured \nmaterials and thin films are important formats for sensing applications, in fact MIP nanoparticles can \nbe considered as direct replacements for antibodies, and this is expected to be a growing trend since \nthey have been demonstrated to act as such in vivo, neutralising the toxic effect of a component of bee \nvenom in mice.\n277\n \n \nSelection of monomer is important, and computational and combinatorial methods can help. Clearly \nthere are cases where a small amount of ionisable or ionised monomer aids in selectivity and \nspecificity of recognition, however too much has a detrimental effect. The majority of functional \nmonomer should however be neutral, with acrylamide being the clear favourite, imparting recognition \nproperties for a wide range of peptide and protein templates. For the sensing platform, a reagentless \nsystem would be preferable, although a sensing system for proteins will, by necessity, involve some \nform of liquid handling. In transduction, SPR and QCM-based sensors and their allied techniques are \nattractive, as a number of instruments are readily available for use with easily modified sensor chips. \nFor electroactive proteins, electrochemical detection would be possible. Such sensors can be sensitive \nand compact, however very few proteins are likely to be redox active in the manner required for \ndetection. Other electrical properties, e.g. capacitance or impedance, can be used and may provide the \nrequired sensitivity.  \nAcknowledgements \n59 \n \nWe wish to thank the Home Office, OSCT (UK) for financial support and guidance during the \npreparation of this manuscript. \nReferences \n 1.
