Murray\nCentre for Electronic Materials and Devices, Imperial College, London SW7 2BZ, United Kingdom\n~Received 24 July 2000!\nWe present far-\/near-infrared double resonance measurements of self-assembled InAs\/GaAs quantum dots.\nThe far-infrared resonance is unambiguously associated with a bound-bound intraband transition in the neutral\ndots. The results show that the interband photoluminescence ~PL! lines originate from conduction levels with\nsuccessively increasing in-plane quantum numbers. We determine the confinement energies for both electrons\nand holes in the same dots. Furthermore, we show that the inhomogeneous broadening of the PL cannot be\nattributed solely to size and composition fluctuation.Crystal growth and lithographic techniques now allow the\nfabrication of semiconductor microstructures such as quan-\ntum box or dot systems.1 The study of these dots is moti-\nvated in part by interest in confinement of charges on very\nsmall length scales and interactions between them. They also\nhave potential advantages for optoelectronic emitters, quan-\ntum computation etc., due to the singular density of states of\nindividual dots. Some of these advantages have yet to be\nfully realized due to the lack of complete understanding of\nthe nature of the excited excitonic states and the way charges\nrelax down the ladder of quantized levels. Furthermore, dot\nensembles can show considerable inhomogeneity, and even\nthe best photoluminescence ~PL! linewidths are typically 15\nto 20 meV.\nThere have been many measurements of intraband spec-\ntroscopy in semiconductor quantum dots2\u20138 as a means to\nprobe the excited states, but we describe here an inter\/\nintraband double resonance investigation of quantum dots.\nThe interest of this technique is that unlike far-infrared ~FIR!\nabsorption or even photoinduced FIR absorption it has al-\nlowed us to make an unequivocal assignment of the resonant\nelectronic bound-bound intraband absorption simultaneously\nwith the interband excitonic transition in neutral dots ~i.e.,\ngiving the electron and hole splittings within the same dots,\nand without the need for n-type and p-type samples!. These\ntransitions may be strongly dependent on charge due to the\nCoulomb energy,8 and it is important to study the transitions\nin neutral systems since these are of primary technological\ninterest. The technique has allowed us to investigate the rela-\ntive importance of the causes of the inhomogeneous broad-\nening.\nThe samples used were InAs\/GaAs self-assembled quan-\ntum dots grown at a low rate,9 which are capped with GaAs.\nThe low temperature PL from these dots under high laser\npower shows a series of very well resolved lines @Fig. 1~a!#.PRB 620163-1829\/2000\/62~12!\/7755~4!\/$15.00For sample A the lowest energy transition, E1-H1, is at 1046\nmeV, and higher peaks are observed at 1114 meV, 1181\nmeV, which are assigned to transitions involving higher\nbound states ~E2-H2 and E3-H3! in the dots. The peaks are\nspaced roughly 68 meV apart and exhibit a full width at half\nmaximum of about 23 meV. Sample B has lowest PL peaks\nat 1239 and 1278 meV, i.e., separated by 39 meV, and full\nwidth 28 meV ~data not shown!. The PL from the confining\nlayer9 and the GaAs matrix are at 1.43 and 1.5 eV, respec-\ntively. Atomic force micrographs of an uncapped sample\ngrown under the same conditions indicate that the dots are of\nin-plane diameter Lxy;50 nm and height Lz;7 nm, with a\ndensity of about 1.731010 cm22. Cross-section scanning\ntransmission electron micrographs of the capped dots show\nthat they are of similar size but lens shaped ~with the axis\nperpendicular to the plane of the substrate! rather than pyra-\nmidal.\nOur double resonance technique is far-infrared modulated\nphotoluminescence ~FIR-MPL! ~Ref. 10! analogous to opti-\ncally detected cyclotron resonance ~ODCR!.11\u201313 The sample\nwas mounted on the cold finger of a liquid helium flow cry-\nostat, with ZnSe or polypropylene windows. The interband\nexcitation was with 0.4 Wcm22 from a c.w. He:Ne laser,\nincident on the top surface of the sample. The PL was col-\nlected and focussed into a 0.5 m grating monochromator, and\ndetected by a liquid nitrogen cooled Ge p-i-n diode. The FIR\nfrom the Rijnhuizen free-electron laser, which is continu-\nously tunable from 5 mm to 250 mm, was incident normal to\nthe substrate side of the sample, and induced a change in the\nPL intensity. The FIR light comes in macropulses, 5 ms long\nand separated by 200 ms, and each macropulse consists of a\ntrain of micropulses about 1 ps in duration, separated by 1\nns. The detector rise time is fast enough to resolve the modu-\nlation effect of the train as a whole ~but not of the individual\nmicropulses! which was boxcar averaged.

MURDIN et al.change in the PL due to the FIR ~i.e., the FIR-MPL! were\ncollected simultaneously to ensure the correspondence of\nfeatures in each by monitoring both the dc and ac outputs of\nthe detector. Spectra were obtained by scanning either the\nmonochromator at fixed FIR frequency or scanning the FIR\nfrequency at a fixed PL frequency. The FIR beam was unfo-\ncussed in order to avoid heating the sample, and the intensity\nwas estimated to be ;1016 photons\/micropulse\/cm2, i.e., of\nthe order of 106 photons per dot\/micropulse.\nFigure 1~b! shows the FIR-MPL for sample A at a FIR\nphoton energy of 65 meV ~a value chosen to be close to the\nseparation between the PL lines!. Figure 1~a! shows the ~low\npump intensity! PL collected simultaneously with the data of\nFig. 1~b!. From the intensity dependence of the PL we esti-\nmate that under the conditions for Fig. 1~b! the ground-state\nemission was about one tenth saturated, with only a small\npopulation in the higher states. The average number of\nelectron-hole pairs per dot was therefore about 0.2 ~because\nthe ground state is doubly degenerate with spin!. However,\nthe MPL experiment only detects those dots with excitons,\ni.e., with at least one electron and one hole. The FIR-MPL\nshows a negative feature at the same photon energy as the\nlowest PL peak, i.e., there is a reduction in the population of\nthe ground state by the FIR. There is a small increase in the\nfirst excited-state population, and a larger increase in the\nsecond excited state. The effect is resonant with FIR energy,\nat 55 meV for sample A. There is no detectable difference in\nthe shape ~only amplitude! of the spectrum at different fixed\nFIR energies, but the effect disappears when detuned suffi-\nciently, as shown in Fig. 2 ~where the PL photon energy is\nkept fixed!. We believe that the only explanation for these\nresults is that the FIR is resonantly exciting electrons from\nFIG. 1. ~a! Squares: PL spectrum taken simultaneously with the\nFIR-MPL data of ~b!, normalized to the peak of the ground-state\nsignal. Triangles: PL spectrum for five times larger intensity show-\ning the clearly resolved higher frequency transitions ~offset for clar-\nity!. Also shown are fits to the low intensity data using two Gauss-\nian lines ~giving a width of the ground state of 2361 meV, solid\nline!. ~b! The FIR-MPL spectrum at a FIR photon energy of 65\nmeV, on the same scale as ~a! ~i.e., showing the change in PL as a\nfraction of the peak PL signal!. The circles are the experimental\ndata and the solid curve is a fit with three Gaussian lines, the lowest\nhaving a width of 2261 meV. All data are for sample A. The\ndecrease of the PL for the first transition and the increase for higher\ntransitions is associated with the transfer of population from the\nground to higher states.the conduction band ground state into higher bound states.\nFigure 2 also seems to show a weak transition at 110 meV,\nwhich may be due to intersublevel transitions from the\nground to the second excited state. The resonance for sample\nB occurred inside the restrahlen band of the GaAs, but we\nestimate it to be centered about 34 meV.\nA full understanding of the strength and width of the fea-\ntures of Fig. 1~b! requires knowledge of the precise photon\nabsorption probabilities from E1 to E2 and from E2 to E3\netc. This in turn depends on which dots have which absorp-\ntions exactly in resonance with the FIR laser. The ladder is\nnot perfectly harmonic, and electrons may only be excited up\nthe ladder so far, in our case up to E3 ~giving a strong posi-\ntive MPL associated with E3!. The population of E2 is in-\ncreased by excitation in from E1, but some electrons are lost\nto E3 ~giving a less strong MPL!. The shape and width of the\nfeatures is also likely to be influenced by this interplay.\nIt is also necessary to point out that if a particular dot has\nan electron in E1 and a hole in H1, then an excitation from\nE1 to E2 will not produce by itself an increase in E2-H2\nluminescence ~and E2-H1 is forbidden!. However, charges\nmay spend long periods of time in excited states due to sev-\neral effects including Pauli blocking and random dot filling14\n~although this is less likely to apply in our low-density re-\ngime!, or the phonon bottleneck.15\nThe MPL effect was suppressed below our signal\/noise\nlevel when the FIR beam was moved to 60\u00b0 to the normal,\nsignificantly reducing the component of the electric field in\nthe growth plane. This shows that the higher states involved\nin the PL have differing in-plane quantum numbers. Transi-\ntions involving bound states with differing out-of-plane\nquantum numbers, states in the wetting layer, free states,\nholes or phonons would not have the same FIR polarization\nselection rule as that observed. Furthermore, it is the PL of\nthe dots that is being modulated resonantly, and there is no\neffect on the PL of the GaAs matrix.\nSeveral authors @e.g., Ref. 16# have reported that in con-\nventional photoluminescence excitation measurement peaks\nin the absorption occur at multiples of the LO phonon energy\nabove the detection energy. The phonon energy for the domi-\nnant 3D confined InAs phonon is at 32.6 meV, with small\ncontributions possible from the InAs wetting layer and bulk\nGaAs at 29.6 and 37.6 meV, respectively.16 Our resonance\nFIG. 2.

In any case\nsuch an effect would have neither the polarization selection\nrule observed, nor the possibility of phonon emission ~at 4\nK! to enhance the PL of the excited states as described\nabove, and we therefore conclude that the MPL signal does\nnot arise from the absorption of phonons.\nFor sample A, the resonant FIR photon energy of Fig. 2\n(E2-E155562 meV) is slightly lower than the separation\nbetween the two lowest PL lines @(E2-H2)2(E1-H1)568\n61 meV#. The errors were estimated from the least-squares\nfitting. This indicates that the separation between the hole\nstates is H2-H151362 meV. Furthermore this proves our\nearlier assumption about the selection rule for the interband\ntransition, namely that E2-H1 is not allowed, as the PL line\nseparation in this case, ~E2-H1!-~E1-H1!, would give the\nsame as the FIR resonance energy, E2-E1. The uncertainty in\nthe measurement of sample B is larger and makes quantifi-\ncation difficult.\nIn the absence of other broadening mechanisms ~which is\nnot the case as we shall see! our measurement would be able\nto distinguish between inhomogeneity in the dot spatial size\nand in the dot potential depth ~i.e., composition!, by analyz-\ning spectral holes burnt in the PL by the FIR. We describe\nthe energy levels for a dot ensemble assuming a top-hat po-\ntential and a disclike spatial shape, since this is a common\napproximation, although the end result is not dependent on\nthis assumption. The energy separation of the lowest in-plane\nlevels varies like 1\/Lxy\n2\n.\n17 The level separation is indepen-\ndent of the potential depth and Lz , because in the absence of\nan energy dependent effective mass, only levels near the top\nof the dot potential are sensitive to band offset. This means\nthat choice of FIR frequency selects a particular lateral dot\nsize, and a spectral hole should be burnt ~if weakly! into the\nPL, manifesting itself as a sharp MPL feature. In fact the\nwidths of both Figs. 1~b! and 2 are within 2 meV of the PL\nwidth Fig. 1~a!.\nWe illustrate the above for sample A with a double reso-\nnance tuning diagram, Fig. 3, for dot ensembles with various\nbroadening mechanisms. The figure shows a contour plot of\nthe number density of dots with a given FIR resonance fre-\nquency and given PL resonance frequency, and this density\ncorresponds to the strength of the FIR-MPL signal. The\ndouble resonance ~FIR-MPL! spectrum at fixed FIR energy\nis obtained by taking a cross-section horizontally across Fig.\n3, and the MPL at fixed PL energy is obtained by cross-\nsecting vertically. The PL linewidth is given by the integrat-\ning over FIR frequency, i.e., the total width projected onto\nthe abscissa, and is 23 meV in each case. Fig. 3~a! shows an\nensemble with inhomogeneity dominated by a Gaussian dis-\ntribution for Lxy , which affects both the FIR and PL energies\nin a correlated way\u2014larger dots have red shifted FIR and\nPL, i.e., giving rise to a diagonal stripe distribution. Figure\n3~b! shows potential depth ~or Lz! fluctuation, which affects\nonly the PL energy\u2014dots with higher composition or larger\nLz have red shifted PL but unaffected FIR frequency, i.e.,\ngiving rise to a horizontal stripe distribution. Figure 3~c!\nshows equal amounts of both together ~by equal we mean\nequal broadening of the PL when either is switched off!.\nIn Fig. 3~a! sharp MPL spectra would be expected for\nboth directions, in case ~b! a sharp MPL at fixed PL energywould be expected, and in case ~c! both MPL spectra would\nbe expected to be about half the width of the PL. Only for a\ndistribution as in Fig. 3~d! would equal widths for all three\nspectra be expected, as shown experimentally in Figs. 1 and\n2. It is clear from the fact that the widths of the PL and both\nMPL spectra are equal, that cases ~a!\u2013~c! do not apply. In\nfact the maximum possible width for Fig. 2 in this model is\n70% of the PL width,8 or 16 meV. The experimental resolu-\ntion ~limited by the FIR laser spectral width! was about 1\nmeV. Although the calculations of Fig. 3 were made using a\none-band, top-hat potential model, use of other, more sophis-\nticated Hamiltonians or other forms for the potential profiles\n~e.g., for a parabolic potential the FIR energy varies as\n1\/Lxy) would not change the qualitative conclusion @namely\nthat a distribution as Fig. 3~d! may not be achieved#. It is not\nknown whether the fluctuation in depth and size are corre-\nlated in our dots, e.g., spatially smaller dots may have deeper\npotential if the total indium content is fixed, but this would\ntend to narrow the distribution on the tuning diagram ~Fig. 3!\ntowards a stripe, rather than rounding it. The distribution of\nFig. 3~d! may only arise for a mechanism or mechanisms\nwhich affect the FIR and PL resonance frequencies in uncor-\nrelated or orthogonal ways, and we must postulate processes\nwhich might do this. ~It may also occur for homogeneous\nbroadening of the PL, e.g., by phonon or Auger scattering,\nbut PL measurements of individual dots have shown very\nnarrow lines by comparison with the entire ensemble, e.g.,\nFIG. 3. Double resonance tuning diagram for dots of sample A\nof different sizes and depths etc. The axes are level separations\nE2-E1 versus E1-H1, and correspond to the FIR and PL resonant\nfrequencies, respectively. The gray contour shows where the den-\nsity of dots with a particular combination of FIR and PL energies is\n50% of its peak. ~a!

In all\ncases the normalized PL spectrum ~FWHM 23 meV! is shown\nagainst the bottom axis. The FIR-MPL spectrum at fixed FIR fre-\nquency of 55 meV is shown against the top axis. Finally, the FIR-\nMPL spectrum at fixed PL frequency of 1046 meV is shown against\nthe left axis. The widths of all three of these spectra are only equal\nfor a distribution as in ~d!. The dashed lines of ~c! are guides to the\neye, and mark the FWHM of each type of spectrum.\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nR7758 PRB 62B. N. MURDIN et al.Ref. 18, and we discount this possibility.!\nThe remaining random variables are the charge ~and state\noccupancy! in each dot, the separation between dots, and\nindium fluctuations within the dots. The charge in each dot is\ndetermined by the excitation power, and the excitonic bind-\ning energy differs between X , XX , X2, and X1 etc. The\nspread of photon energies which may be generated by a re-\ncombination may thus vary, with a range from about 3\u20134\nmeV8,19\u201321 for singly charged excitons. This mechanism is\ntherefore unlikely to be solely responsible for the double\nresonance linewidths. A small separation between dots can\ncause e-h pairs to couple with adjacent dots via the wave-\nfunction overlap or via the Coulomb interaction ~if there is\ncharge or a dipole in those dots!, and the strength of such\ncoupling depends on the separation.8,17,22\u201326 Our dot density\ncorresponds to a mean center-to-center dot separation which\nis quite large, about 85 nm and as dipole-dipole interactions\nfall off as 1\/r3, it seems unlikely that in our weakly-excited\nand neutral system that such coupling is strong either. How-\never, when these mechanisms are convoluted with several\nother stochastic mechanisms ~size, depth, interdot coupling!\na distribution more like Fig. 3~d! may result.In summary, we have measured the intersublevel absorp-\ntion in self-assembled quantum dots, and shown that higher\nenergy PL lines arise from the in-plane confinement. We\nmake a quantitative determination of the separation between\nboth lowest electronic states and corresponding hole states\n~E2-E1 5 55 meV, H2-H1 5 13 meV! in a single experi-\nment. Lastly, the measurements of the inhomogeneity of our\nvery narrow linewidth sample show that mechanisms other\nthan spatial size or potential depth fluctuations must also\ncontribute to the broadening of the PL spectra.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank R.
