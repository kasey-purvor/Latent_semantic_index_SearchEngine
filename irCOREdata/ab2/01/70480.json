Such devices can be \nused as the end-system in network-based (single or multi- \nuser) interactive systems. However, design guidelines for \nbuilding  mobile  interactive  systems  are  surprisingly \nscarce. Developers require design guidelines that take into \naccount the possible affects that operation in the mobile \ncommunications  environment  may  have  on  the  user's \ninteraction with the system. \nIn this paper, we do not claim to report a rich set of design \nguidelines to be used when constructing mobile interactive \nsystems.  Instead,  we  argue  the  case  for  one,  fairly \nstraightforward, guideline. Our argument is that designers \nshould consider the potential benefits of providing users \nwith increased levels of awareness in order to enable the \nuser to deal with the constraints imposed by unreliable and \nunpredictable network communications. \nThis principle builds  on the approach argued in  [1],  i.e. \nthat by providing cooperating users with increased levels \nof  awareness  they  are  better  equipped  to  deal  with \nproblems  caused  by the  temporal  delays  resulting  from \nunreliable network communications. In this paper, we use \nthe  term  mobile-awareness  to  describe  the  notion  of \nproviding users  with an awareness  of the affect that the \nmobile  communications  environment might have  on the \nuser's interaction with the system (or with other users via \nthe system). \nThe remainder of this  paper  discusses  our investigation \ninto  the  notion  of  mobile-awareness  through  the \ndevelopment of two mobile interactive systems, namely: \nMOST  [2,3]  and  GUIDE  [4,5].  Work  on  the  MOST \nsystem enabled us  to  investigate  some  of the  problems \nassociated  with supporting  group-based  collaboration in \nthe  presence of unreliable  communications.  Conversely, \nduring our work on the GUIDE system, we were able to \nconsider  various  ways  of dealing  with the  problems  of \ninaccurate or out-of-date information being presented to \ncity  visitors  as  a  result  of  temporary  network \ndisconnection. \nMOBILE-AWARENESS  IN MOST \nThe MOST System \nThe MOST (Mobile Open Systems Technologies) system \nwas  developed  to  support  multimedia  collaboration \nbetween  highly  mobile  field  engineers  working  on  the \npower  distribution  network.  The  application  was \ndeveloped using an open distributed systems platform that \nwas  effectively  a  forerunner  to  the  popular  CORBA \nplatform. \nThe  MOST  groupware  application  was  based  around  a \nshared GIS (Geographic Information System) component. \nThis  component was  designed to  improve  collaboration \nbetween field engineers by enabling them to make shared \nannotations to network schematics representing sections of \nthe  power  distribution  network.  The  MOST  application \nwas  developed to run on laptop  computers and network \nconnectivity was achieved using conventional land lines, \nthe GSM phone network, or the company's analogue PMR \n(Private Mobile Radio) system. \nProblems Caused  By Mobility \nAt an early stage in the project, we demonstrated a version \nof  the  MOST  application  to  field  engineers.  The \ndemonstration involved testing how the system could be \nused by field engineers in  a  hypothetical fault scenario. \nThe  first  stage  of  the  demonstration  involved  the \nestablishment of a collaborating group comprising a small \nnumber  of  field  engineers  and  personnel  from  the \nelectricity company's control centre. The establishment of \nthe group was managed using the MOST session manager \nand communications between the various group members \nwas  achieved  using  GSM.  The  second  stage  of  the \ndemonstration involved the group of engineers receiving \ninstructions  from the  control  centre  on  how  to  fix  the \nhypothetical  fault.  Engineers  were  then  able  to  use  the \nshared  GIS  component  in  order  to  reveal  to  other \nengineers the modifications that they were making to the \nsections of the power distribution network on which they \nwere  working.  For  reasons  of  safety,  it  is  of  critical \nimportance  that  the  state  of the  shared  GIS  (and  the \nrepresentation of the power distribution network) should \nappear consistent to all group members. \nFollowing the  demonstration, a  discussion took place  in \nwhich the  engineers raised the  following issues.  Firstly, \nengineers demanded some feedback regarding the identity \n8  SlGGROUP Bulletin  April 2001Nol 22, No.1 of group members that were unable to receive their shared \nannotations because of transitory network disconnection. \nSecondly, engineers were confused and frustrated by the \nfact that  they received no indication that  establishing  a \nconnection to the rest of the group using the GSM service \ncould  take  over  ten  seconds.  Engineers  were  also \nfrustrated by the fact that they received no indication as to \nthe  likely  delay  that  could  occur  before  their  shared \nannotations were received by all group members. \nApproach \nIn  order to  address  the  issues  raised  during  the  mobile \ndemonstration, we chose to modify the session manager in \norder  to  provide  field  engineers  with  visual  feedback \nregarding the  group's  current level of connectivity. The \nmotivation  for  this  being  that  such  awareness  should \nprevent  group  members  from  being  forced  to  make \n(possibly false) assumptions regarding the current state of \ntheir  connectivity with  the  rest  of the  group.  We  also \nchose to provide visual feedback regarding the timeliness \nwith  which  other  members  of  the  group  received  an \nengineer's annotations on the shared GIS. \nFrom an application developer's perspective, one of the \ncrucial implications of our chosen approach was the need \nfor a suitable group service to support the development of \nthis  class  of distributed  application.  In  more  detail,  the \ntraditional  approach  adopted  by the  distributed  systems \ncommunity  was  to  enforce  network  transparency  when \nsupporting  group  communications.  In  effect, this  meant \npreventing the application programmer from receiving any \nnotifications when group connectivity problems occurred. \nFor this reason, we developed our own QoS (or Quality- \nof-Service)  based  group  service  [6]  to  support  the \ndevelopment  of  the  MOST  application.  This  service \nenabled application level services to request notifications \nfrom the distributed systems platform when the  level of \ngroup-based communication fell below a certain stipulated \nthreshold. \nThe MOST session manager \nIn order to provide engineers with mobile-awareness we \nexperimented with the development of various graphical \ninterfaces  to  the  system's  session  manager  component. \nOne  prototype  design  for  an  interface  to  the  session \nmanager is shown in figure 1. \nFigure 1. An interface to the MOST session manager. \nThe significant point to note about this interface is that it \nuses colour in order to enable an engineer to realise the \nstate  of connectivity  of  other  members  of the  group. \nFurthermore, the interface enables an engineer to request \nvisual feedback when the temporal delay associated with \npropagating  a  shared  GIS  annotation  exceeds  a  given \nthreshold. \n\u2022 MOBILE-AWARENESS  IN GUIDE \nThe GUIDE system \nThe GUIDE system combines mobile end-systems with a \nwireless infrastructure in order to present city visitors with \ninformation  tailored  to  both  their  personal  and \nenvironmental  context.  In  more  detail,  the  wireless \ninfrastructure currently deployed in the city of Lancaster \ncomprises  six  high-bandwidth  802.11-based \ncommunications ceils. These cells have been strategically \nplaced around the city in order to cover the city's most \nsignificant tourist attractions.  The portable GUIDE end- \nsystems  use  this  infrastructure  in  order  to  access \ninteractive  services  and  highly dynamic  information.  In \naddition,  this  same  network  infrastructure  is  used  to \nprovide  location  information  by  broadcasting  location \n'beacons' that can then be received by the GUIDE units as \nthey move within coverage of a wireless cell. \nProblems Caused By Mobility \nThe current design of the GUIDE system entails a degree \nof reliance  on network connectivity. However, the  cell- \nbased communications infrastructure currently deployed in \nLancaster does not provide blanket coverage over the city. \nConsequently,  situations  can  occur  in  which  mobile \nGUIDE units lose network connectivity. \nIn  order  to  tolerate  occasional  disconnection  from  the \nnetwork  the  GUIDE  units  cache  information  locally. \nHowever, there are still three key implications that need to \nbe considered when using  GUIDE units  in disconnected \nmode. Firstly, information updates may not be received in \na  timely manner. For example, an update stating that the \nvisitor's intended castle tour has been cancelled might not \nbe  received  in  time  for the  visitor  to  make  alternative \nplans.  Secondly,  while  disconnected,  visitors  will  be \nunable to send or receive messages via their GUIDE units. \nFinally,  the  automatic  presentation  of  location-aware \ninformation will be affected because the GUIDE unit will \nnot receive location beacons. \nApproach \nWhen  deciding how to  tackle this  problem,  one  design \napproach would have been to keep the problem hidden or \ntransparent from the user. For example, the system could \nhave  been  designed  to  simply  present  the  user  with \nwhatever  (possibly  stale)  information  happened  to  be \ncontained in the GUIDE unit's cache following previous \ninformation updates.  One could argue that the benefit of \nsuch an approach is that the system might have appeared \nsimpler and less daunting to the user. However, a visitor \nSIGGROUP Bulletin  April 2001Nol 22, No.1  9 would  clearly begin  to  loose  faith  in  the  system if the \nsystem proceeded to lead them to the castle only for the \nvisitor to find that their tour had been cancelled. \nIndeed, our major concem was that the behaviour of the \nsystem should not appear unpredictable to visitors during \nperiods  of disconnection  because  this  could  adversely \naffect the visitor's trust. Our adopted approach for dealing \nwith this problem was to design the system's user interface \nin such a way that the user would be encouraged to form a \nsuitable mental model of the system's behaviour, i.e. one \nin which the functionality of the system is not static but \nactually dependant on whether or not wireless connectivity \nis currently available [5]. \nGiven our chosen approach,  we required a  suitable  and \nfamiliar metaphor for representing the association between \nconnectivity and system functionality. In more detail, we \ndecided to incorporate a  metaphor into the GUIDE user \ninterface that would both provide visitors with feedback \nregarding the current state of connectivity and encourage \nvisitors  to  associate  this  with  available  system \nfunctionality.  We  arrived  at  a  suitable  metaphor  by \nconsidering how connectivity feedback is provided on that \nvery popular wireless communications device, namely, the \nmobile  phone.  The  user  of  a  mobile  phone  is  given \nfeedback on their current connectivity in the form of 'bars \nof  connectivity'.  When  a  user  receives  no  bars  of \nconnectivity they  expect  limited  functionality,  i.e.  the \ninability  to  send  or  receive  text  messages  or  make  or \nreceive  calls.  The  'bars  of connectivity' metaphor was \nthus  incorporated into  the  user  interface of GUIDE  as \nillustrated in figure 2. \nbu~  ~d-on  I  ~ \nI  the  internet.  ~ere  is  eI~o  an  excellent  Care  and  I \nFigure 2. Utilising the 'bars of connectivity' metaphor. \nA  similar use  of the  'bars  of connectivity' metaphor  is \nnow being utilised on another mobile interactive system \n(also  based  around  802.11  wireless  networking)  called \nGhostbusters [7]. \nRevealing  the Status of Location Updates \nAs described earlier, the GUIDE system currently  obtains \npositioning information through the network infrastructure \nvia the reception of location beacons. Consequently, given \nthe  potential  for  disconnected  operation  the  GUIDE \nsystem  can  effectively loose  track  of  the  location  of \nvisitors. \nWe are currently considering supplementing the location- \ntracking element of GUIDE using  GPS.  However, even \nwith the  addition  of GPS,  there  may still  be  occasions \nwhen  up-to-date  positioning  information  will  be \nunavailable.  For  example,  when  using  GPS  in  a  city \nSlGGROUP Bulletin  Apdl  2001Nol 22, No.1  10 \nenvironment the position of tall buildings can prevent the \nGPS system from 'seeing' a sufficient number of satellites \nto obtain a fix on location (the so-called 'Canyon' effect). \nClearly, if we decided to provide the visitor with location- \naware information based on an out-of-date location then \nthis  could produce  somewhat  surprising  results  for  the \nvisitor.  Consequently, we  chose to  enable the  visitor to \ntemper their confidence in the location-aware information \ngiven by revealing  to  the  visitor  the  status  of location \nupdates.  In  more  detail,  we  utilise  a  small  message \nwindow in the bottom left of the main display in order to \nreassure  the  visitor  that  location  updates  are  being \nreceived or to warn the visitor that location updates have \nnot been received for some time (see figure 3). \nFigure 3. Providing the visitor with an awareness of \nthe current state of location tracking. \nBy using a separate part of the display to reveal the status \nof  location  updates  we  will  not  need  to  change  the \ninterface if GPS is incorporated into the system. In more \ndetail, when using  GPS a  situation could arise  in which \nlocation information is being received by the GUIDE unit \ndespite  network  connectivity being  unavailable.  In  this \ncase the bars of connectivity icon would show  'no bars' \nwhile the location status message window would indicate \nthat location updates were still being received. \nVisitors Acceptance of Awareness Information \nA  field trial of the GUIDE system was conducted in the \nsummer of 1999. The field trial involved sixty members of \nthe public  from a  variety of different backgrounds.  The \nresults of this field trial are well documented in [5]. One \nof  the  findings  from  the  field-trial  was  that  a  large \nmajority (54\/60)  of visitors  noted that  they were  aware \nthat their GUIDE unit utilized wireless communications in \na similar way to a mobile phone and that when no bars of \nconnectivity were  shown  on the  interface then  reduced \nfunctionality  would  be  available.  Furthermore,  a \nreasonable  majority  (47\/60)  of  visitors  said  they \nappreciated the fact that the system knew of their location \nto  within  a  certain  area  and  that  this  knowledge  relied \nupon the reception of location updates. \nCONCLUDING REMARKS \nThe main argument of this paper has been that designers \nneed to take into consideration the constraints imposed by \nmobile  communications  environments  when  designing \nmobile interactive systems. In particular, we have argued \nthe case for a design approach in which the user is given \nthe  opportunity  to  adapt  to  the  unpredictability  often \nfound in mobile environments.  Furthermore, in  order to adapt  their  own  behaviour,  users  require  appropriate \ninformation  regarding  the  impact  of  the  mobile \nenvironment  on  the  functionality  or  behaviour  of  the \ninteractive system. \nIn the work described, we made explicit design choices in \norder to provide such information or awareness to users. \nIn  the  multi-user  MOST  system,  field  engineers  were \ngiven an awareness of the state of connectivity across the \ngroup. Such awareness information was included to help \nto prevent group members  from making (possibly false) \nassumptions  regarding  the  current  state  of  their \nconnectivity with the rest of the group. Conversely, in the \nGUIDE  system,  the  interface  was  designed  to  include \nfeatures that encourage the visitor to appreciate that the \nfunctionality  provided  by  the  system  is  affected  by \nnetwork connectivity. \nOne  implication  of  our  advocated  approach  is  that \ndesigners  must  clearly  consider  the  information  vs. \ndisturbance  tradeoff so  that  the  awareness  information \nprovided  to  the  user  does  not  result  in  information \noverload. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Dix A.
