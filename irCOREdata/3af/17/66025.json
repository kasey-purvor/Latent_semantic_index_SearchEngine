Introduction \nThe determination of absorbed dose by measurement of the integrated luminescence, \nstimulated either thermally or optically, forms the basis of the commonly used techniques in \nluminescence dating and dosimetry. The success of such determinations is critically \ndependent on the ability of the mineral stimulated to yield sufficient luminescence, and it is \nwell known that the sensitivity of minerals found in typical samples may vary by orders of \nmagnitude between not only different mineral types but also the same mineral (e.g. quartz). \nThis is in contrast to synthetic luminescent phosphors, such as those used for dosimetry and \nimaging, that are manufactured to be homogeneous. In the case of the latter, for example, \nstorage phosphors on image plate detectors are used to determine the spatial distribution of \nionising radiation (Thoms and von Seggern, 1996). In dating and retrospective dosimetry \nstudies, typical samples are likely to contain a heterogeneous distribution of minerals \npossessing different sensitivity and dose histories, and the latter presents particular difficulties \nin the case of unheated sediments. The separation and isolation of a particular mineral \ncomponent for luminescence measurements, which requires the fragmentation of the sample \nmatrix, has consequently formed a key part of the development of routine techniques for \nabsorbed dose determination. The use of spatially-resolved detectors has revealed that \nvariations between grains of the same mineral type commonly occur due to differing \nsensitivity (heated and sediment samples) and differing dose histories (sediment samples), and \nboth can lead to complications in absorbed dose evaluation.  Several different forms of \ndetection system capable of spatially-resolved measurement of either optically or thermally \nstimulated luminescence have been reported in the literature, including: image intensifiers \n(Templer and Walton, 1983; Huntley and Kirkey, 1985), photographic films (Hashimoto et \nal., 1989; Hashimoto et al., 1995), imaging photon detectors (Smith et al., 1991; McFee and \nTite, 1994) and CCD-cameras (e.g. Hashimoto et al., 1995, Duller et al., 1997; Spooner, \n2000; Greilich et al., 2002). Although the latest CCD-cameras are claimed to offer high \n 4\nspatial resolution (~10 \u03bcm), wide spectral sensitivity and high quantum efficiency, the overall \nsensitivity of these systems still appears to be inferior to PMT-based readers. This is largely \ndue to a lower signal-to-noise ratio and the reported levels of minimal detectable absorbed \ndose are several Gy for samples of K-feldspar (grains, Duller et al., 1997; slices, Greilich et \nal., 2002).  \n \nAnother approach that can be used to perform spatially-resolved measurement of OSL is \nbased on the use of a focused laser beam to stimulate a selected area of sample and to detect \nthe luminescence using a single PMT. By moving the beam across the sample or by moving a \nsample under a fixed beam, executing a scanning action, spatially-resolved measurement of \nthe luminescence can be performed by appropriate control of the photon detection system.  \nThis approach was applied to measure optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) from storage \nphosphor plates used in radiographic systems (Blasse and Grabmaier, 1994), and a one-\ndimensional OSL scanning system was used by B\u00f8tter-Jensen et al. (1995) to record depth-\ndose profiles in ceramic materials. The development of a two dimensional OSL scanning \nsystem for use with planar ceramic samples was demonstrated by Bailiff et al. (1996), and \nsimilar elements of this approach were employed by Duller et al. (1999; 2000) in the \ndevelopment of an automated scanning system. The latter enables OSL measurements to be \nperformed with separated single-grains, where the laser beam is moved discretely to each \ngrain in a 9\u00d79 location grid. In this paper we describe a two-dimensional scanning system that \nis based on the prototype (Bailiff et al. loc. cit) and which can perform measurement of the \nOSL signal from slices (and grains) with a sub-millimeter resolution. The scanner has been \nconfigured to map the distribution of OSL and to perform in situ determinations of absorbed \ndose for grains within a sample matrix (e.g. a ceramic slice). The scanner is used with either a \n 5\ncontinuous wave (CW) or a pulsed laser stimulation source, the latter being used to \ninvestigate the mineral type by measuring time-resolved luminescence (TRL). \n \n2. Instrumentation  \nA schematic diagram of the OSL scanner is shown in Fig. 1; the assembly is contained within \na light-tight housing.  The central component of the apparatus comprises a motorized X-Y \nstage (Physik Instrumente type C-832) on which a sample mount is located. The laser beam is \ndirected onto the sample surface at angle of approximately 45\u00ba after passing through an \nelectronically controlled shutter, a cut-off filter (to eliminate residual emission of laser pump \nradiation), neutral density filters selected to vary the stimulation intensity, a long-focus lens, \nand finally a front-surfaced mirror. The detection system, mounted 30 mm directly above the \nsample, comprises a PMT and optical filter system. The beam geometry was adjusted to \nprevent the reflected beam striking the detector. The specification of the detection system \ndiffers when using either the CW or pulsed laser sources and these are discussed further \nbelow. The sample is moved under the path of the beam in a stepwise manner under the PC \ncontrol; after each increment the shutter is opened for a selected stimulation period (e.g. 200 \nms) and the OSL recorded. In terms of scan images presented below the scan starts at the \norigin and proceeds in a raster pattern finishing at the top right corner of the image. Unless \nspecified otherwise, an increment of 250 \u03bcm was selected for the measurements described in \nthis paper, resulting in 1600 measurement points per complete scan. Once started, a scan is \nperformed under software control and takes about 30 mins to complete, most of the time \nbeing required for stage movement (~1 s per increment).  \n \nDepending on the nature of the experiment, CW or pulsed laser stimulation was used. The \nconstant intensity source comprised a CW Ar-ion laser (Reliant 250D, Laser Physics), \n 6\noperated in multi-lines mode. When using this source the detection system comprised an EMI \n9635QA PMT and Schott U-340 filters (6 mm), and the signal was fed to an Ortec ACE-\nMCS. Pulsed stimulation was provided by a tuneable optical parametric oscillator (Quanta \nRay MOPO 710) pumped by a Q-switched YAG:Nd laser. The luminescence detection \nsystem is a further development of that described by Clark et al. (1997) and includes a fast \nPMT (EMI 9813QA) and a 2 ns resolution multi-channel scaler (Fast Comtec P7885) that \nenables the measurement of time-resolved luminescence. Two stimulation wavelengths were \nused with the pulsed source, either 500 or 850 nm, and the TRL was recorded using Schott U-\n340 (6 mm) and Schott BG-39 (3 mm) filters in the detection system respectively. \n \nThe optical system focuses the laser beam to a spot, the size of which is adjusted to suit the \nexperiment and measured by use of a photodiode detector and a 50 \u03bcm-slit translated across \nthe focal plane. Using the CW source, the beam diameter was adjusted to 250 \u03bcm and the \nincident power density set to either 1.5 or 3.6 W cm-2 using appropriate neutral density filters. \nThe lower intensity was used to \u2018scan\u2019 the general OSL distribution with reduced trapped \ncharge depletion. \n \nTo obtain precise sample re-positioning, samples (either sliced or granular) were fastened to \nmachined metal plates. Good positioning accuracy of these plates was achieved using an \nadapted spring-loaded corner positioning stage originally manufactured for an optical \nmicroscope; positioning tests showed that the maximum deviation in positioning was about 30 \n\u03bcm. This was considered satisfactory given that the spatial resolution of the system is mainly \ndetermined by the beam diameter (set at 250 \u03bcm). Repeated experiments, which included \nseveral sample changes followed by scanning, showed no detectable lateral shift of the OSL \nimage.   \n 7\n \nThe control software allows the stage to move to a selected position within the scanned area \nso that an OSL decay curve can be recorded; this facility was employed when measuring CW \nOSL decay curves and the TRL spectra. A high precision diamond impregnated cutting wheel \nwas used to produce slices of known and reproducible thickness (generally less than 1 mm). \nAbsorbed doses were administered to samples using a beta irradiator containing a 90Sr\/90Y  \u03b2 \nsource, that had been previously calibrated against a 137Cs photon source for granular samples \n(G\u00f6ksu et al., 1995); a further calibration experiment was performed to determine the \nabsorbed dose for sliced ceramic samples. The dose-rate delivered by the laboratory source to \n1 mm thick ceramic slices mounted on stainless-steel discs was 0.95 \u00b10.02 Gy min-1. \n \n3. Applications  \n \n3.1. OSL mapping  \nTo illustrate the use of the equipment we include the results of measurements with ceramic \nsamples (bricks) collected for retrospective dosimetry measurements, where the levels of \nabsorbed dose are typically up to several hundred mGy. Examples of other heated and \nunheated materials, including annealed single crystal quartz, were also tested since the range \nof potential use clearly extends beyond ceramics. For the selection of brick samples tested so \nfar and using standard OSL measurement procedures, the detected OSL was found in all cases \nto be concentrated in a few localised \u2018spots\u2019 within the 10 x 10 mm scanned areas, and the \nremainder of the cut surface yielded signals that were not significantly above the detector \nbackground. In the example shown in Fig. 2 OSL decay curves were only measurable at the \n\u2018spots\u2019 labelled A, and B the decay curves for which are shown in insets a and b. Subsequent \nexamination of the slices under an optical microscope confirmed that the low number of \n 8\nemitting spots was not due to a paucity of granular quartz or infrequent exposure of grains at \nthe cut surface.  These observations are consistent with past (Huntley and Kirkey, 1985) and \nrecent findings (e.g. Duller et al., 2000) that have revealed significant variations in the \nsensitivity of single grains for different types of sedimentary quartz.  \n \nCementitious materials are also potentially useful for the retrospective dosimetry (G\u00f6ksu et \nal., 2002). An OSL scan performed with a slice of modern concrete (Fig. 3) reveals a very \nirregular distribution of OSL and the dynamic range of the detected signal is significantly \nhigher than that found with brick. The dynamic range is due to the geological dose associated \nwith the blend of minerals contained in the matrix; unfortunately the hydrated cement yields \ncomparatively weak luminescence (G\u00f6ksu et al., 2002). Although differences in the rate of \ndecay are likely to occur due to variations in the optical conditions within grains, the OSL \ndecay curves show differences (Fig. 3, insets a and b) that may reflect mineral type \n(McKeever et al., 1997), curves a and b being indicative of feldspar and quartz respectively. \nWhile tentative identification of the mineral species may be feasible based on decay rates, \ntime resolved measurements can provide a more specific marker, as discussed at a later stage \nin this paper. \n \nDental porcelain, a ceramic of semi-vitreous composition that is of interest in retrospective \ndosimetry (Bailiff et al., 2002a), was also examined.  The measurement of spatially resolved \nOSL is of interest since it potentially offers the opportunity to select a particular mineral \nphase, if required, and also to measure a depth-dose profile where external beta particles and \nsoft x-rays contribute to the external dose.  Fig. 4 shows the spatial variation of the OSL for \ntwo slices of prosthetic tooth (i.e. solid dental porcelain) that were cut perpendicular to the \nmain axis of the tooth, providing a horizontal cross section, measured immediately following \n 9\nthe administration of a beta dose and pre-heating. It is interesting to note that the OSL \nintensity decreases rapidly moving from the tooth core to the surface. Although there is a \nslight drop in beta dose with distance from the central axis, this is not attributed to the radial \ndependence of source dose rate. When originally calibrated, our source produced results \nsimilar to those published recently by Spooner and Allsop (2000), with a difference between \ncentre and the edge of a 10 mm diameter sample of less than 10%.   The observed change in \nOSL intensity is likely to reflect changes in sample sensitivity and reflects a layered structure \nresulting from the manufacturing process. This will be of importance in the study of optical \nand athermal fading effects that are currently under investigation (Bailiff et al., 2002a). \n \nExperiments were undertaken to test the capability of the scanner to measure absorbed dose as \na function of depth in samples subjected to \u03b2- irradiation. The surface of a (thick) fragment of \ndomestic porcelain was irradiated using a beta source (estimated sub-surface beta dose, 3 Gy). \nThe fragment was subsequently cut in a direction perpendicular to the surface to provide a \nslice that extended from the surface glaze to the interior. The OSL map obtained for the slice \nis shown in Fig. 5 and, as found by Poolton et al. (1995), the OSL sensitivity of the glaze is \nsignificantly higher (attributed to the presence of Al2O3) than that of the interior matrix that \nappears to have negligible sensitivity. The OSL map from the glaze corresponds well to the \nspatial dimensions of the semi-transparent 250 \u03bcm thick glaze layer (Fig. 5). A similar \nexperiment was performed with a 6 mm thick cylindrical pellet (diameter 10 mm) that was \nfabricated by combining granular Al2O3:C (Landauer Inc., 90-150 \u03bcm) with a setting binder. \nThe pellet was irradiated using the laboratory \u03b2-source, delivering an absorbed dose of \napproximately 800 mGy in the sub-surface material. Slices were cut from the pellet along the \naxis of the cylinder to enable the depth-dose profile to be measured. The recorded distribution \nof the OSL (Fig. 6) shows a steep build-up at the edge and gradual decline to background \n 10\nlevels at about 4 mm below the surface. The general form of the OSL profile agrees well with \nthat expected by calculation (Attix, 1986) and is consistent with a penetration depth of 3.8 \nmm estimated for \u03b2\u2212particles in Al2O3 using the continuous slowing down approximation \nrange (CSDA range, 1.51 g cm-2; ICRU Report, 1984). Further calculation of the dose profile \nbased on Monte Carlo simulation of electron transport is to be performed to enable a \nquantitative comparison of profiles to be obtained.  \n \nAn OSL scanning system of the type described here, when compared with a spatially-resolved \ndetector system that employs uniform stimulation across the sample, is expected to be at a \ndisadvantage when measuring transparent or semi-transparent samples. The effects of optical \nscattering may reduce the effective spatial resolution of scanning due to the stimulation of a \nvolume within which many single grains may be located. In this respect, the opacity of a clay-\nbased ceramic matrix provides an important reduction in the level of light scattering between \ngrains. Although a quantitative test to evaluate the extent of these effects in transparent slices \nhas yet to be performed, we examined slices of synthetic quartz to explore the distribution of \nOSL. Slices of 1 mm thickness were cut (orthogonal to the z-axis) from a single bar of \nsynthetic quartz (Sawyer Premium Q grade; see Petrov and Bailiff, 1995), polished and \nannealed at 1000 \u00b0C in air. The OSL map obtained with a beta-irradiated slice is shown in \nFig. 7a and b. The distribution of OSL is very inhomogeneous, containing identifiable areas \nthat emit relatively bright luminescence, and with a dynamic range of intensity that extends to \nan order of magnitude within the scanned area. Apart from the issue of spatial resolution \nachieved, the data indicate that the traps are spatially localized on a macroscopic scale, \nprobably reflecting features of crystal formation during hydrothermal growth. Similar spatial \nvariation in the TL and OSL in quartz was reported by Hashimoto et al. (1997) who attributed \nthe striped patterns to the anisotropy of impurity distribution.  Such data suggest that in the \n 11\ncase of sedimentary quartz, the cause of significant variability of the OSL intensity of single \ngrains is related to growth conditions of the progenitor single crystals, although the effects of \nheat treatment is a further factor to take into account in the case of quartz extracted from \nheated materials. \n \n3.2. Dose reconstruction \nHaving established the feasibility of obtaining an OSL map and measuring OSL decay curves \nat specific locations in sliced ceramic, the spatially-resolved determination of absorbed dose \nwas investigated.  This was performed with slices in two stages by: i) scanning, using low \npower and short duration stimulation, to produce an OSL map and identify the location of \n\u2018spots\u2019 emitting sufficient luminescence; ii) application of a regeneration procedure to \ndetermine the absorbed dose at the spots identified in the mapping. The loss of trapped charge \ndue to depletion during the mapping process was corrected using of the form of the decay \ncurve measured in the second stage and taking into account the differences in the intensity of \nthe stimulation beam. In samples tested so far, the correction for depletion due to the scanning \nprocedure is in the range 5-7%, but this is likely to vary between types of ceramic sample. \nThe reliability of this correction was tested by administering a beta dose of 350 mGy to an \noptically bleached slice, performing a scan to obtain the OSL map, and then determining the \n\u2018recovered\u2019 dose using a regenerative procedure at the known luminescent spot(s). The \nrecovered value of absorbed dose was 325\u00b135 mGy which corresponds to an average \ndepletion of 7% due to the scan procedure, and this agrees well with the estimate of 6\u00b11 % \nbased on examination of the form of the OSL decay curve for the measurement location.  \n \nThe dose evaluation procedure was tested with slices cut from a 28 year-old brick that had \nbeen obtained from a Russian settlement contaminated by Chernobyl fallout. A sample from \n 12\nthe same brick had been previously examined in detail to obtain absorbed dose determinations \nwith separated coarse grains (Bailiff et al., 2000, 2002b). Since no acid etching treatments \nwere applied to the cut surface, any grains exposed by the cutting process retained an alpha \ndose contribution. Subsequent inspection under a microscope indicated that the exposed \ngrains were generally free of coatings, although other types of ceramic may require some \nform of cleaning treatment to improve the brightness of the luminescence. \n \nOSL maps for slices were obtained and the location of spots exhibiting sufficiently bright \nluminescence identified; a representative example is given in Fig. 8. In a subsequent \nexperiment, the OSL from these areas was confirmed to be due to quartz by examination of \nthe time-resolved luminescence spectrum (see below). Using a regenerative procedure, values \nof absorbed dose of 334\u00b134, 357\u00b127 and 330\u00b122 mGy were obtained (uncertainties are \nprecision only) for the three different spots indicated, yielding an average value of 340\u00b115 \nmGy (s.d. 3). An upper limit of 15 mGy was estimated for the alpha dose contribution using \ntypical parameter values (a=0.1; 125 \u03bcm grain dia.; 20 \u03bcm penetration) and measured dose-\nrates. After subtraction of the alpha dose contribution, the in-situ grain result is encouragingly \nclose to the consensus value of 325\u00b115 mGy obtained using a multiple-grain procedure with \nquartz extracted from the equivalent depth range in the same brick (Bailiff et al., 2002b). The \nclose agreement in this case may be fortuitous given the precision obtained using a simplified \nregeneration procedure, but it nonetheless points to the feasibility of the in-situ grain approach \nwith sliced ceramics, albeit with their sparse occurrence in the particular samples tested. \n \n3.3. Time resolved measurement  \nAlthough, as discussed above, an indication of mineral type can be inferred by the form of the \nOSL decay curve or by stimulation with IR radiation (to identify feldspars), it can also be \n 13\nobtained by examination of the TRL spectrum. Whereas the TRL associated with quartz and \ndetected in the UV region is dominated by a decay component with a lifetime of 30-40 \u03bcs \n(Bailiff, 2000), different types of feldspars exhibit complex decay spectra that have \ncomponent lifetimes of less than 1 \u03bcs (Clark et al., 1997; Clark and Bailiff, 1998) and this \ndifference provides a means of differentiating the two mineral species.   \n \nThis approach was used to investigate the mineral composition of brick that had been \ncollected from the Chernobyl and Semipalatinsk regions. Powder XRD spectra indicated that \nthe former contained predominantly quartz and the latter a mixture of quartz and feldspar. A \nslice of the brick from the Semipalatinsk region was first scanned using 850 nm pulsed \nradiation and the OSL map, obtained by measuring the integrated luminescence, contains \nseveral distinctive spots of emission (labelled A-C), as shown in Fig. 9a. The TRL spectra \nobtained at these locations (Fig. 10) are characteristic of feldspathic minerals, having a \ndominant decay component with a lifetime in the range 2- 5 \u03bcs (Clark et al., 1997). The OSL \nmap obtained after a second scan, performed using 500 nm stimulation; and shown in Fig 9b \nincludes spots A and B identified under 850 nm stimulation and an additional strongly \nemitting spot D. The TRL spectra for locations A and B were similar in form (the intensity \nwas reduced during the second scan); analysis of the spectrum recorded at location B (Fig 9b) \nindicates two lifetime components of ~ 0.5 \u03bcs (dominant) and ~2 \u03bcs and this is consistent \nwith the behaviour observed with potassic feldspars when stimulating with IR and changing \nthe detection window from broad band to the UV (Clark and Bailiff, 1998).  This evidence, \ncombined with the measurement of TRL under both IR and visible stimulation at the same \nlocation, strongly suggests that the emitting minerals are feldspathic. Several new brightly \nemitting spots were also resolved under green stimulation and their TRL spectra were found \nto be characteristic of quartz (dominated single component with mean lifetime ~33 \u03bcs), as \n 14\nshown by the TRL spectrum recorded at location D (Fig. 11) and is quite distinct from that \nmeasured at location B, attributed to a feldspathic mineral.  The slices of brick from the \nChernobyl region that were the subject of the absorbed dose measurements discussed above \nwere also examined using this approach and the areas used for absorbed dose determination \nwere confirmed to be quartz on the basis of their TRL spectra. \n \nAlthough confirmation of the mineral type (e.g. thin section or electron probe measurements) \nor detailed examination of the TRL spectra has not been attempted here, these results illustrate \nthe potential of the method for differentiating mineral components. While the ceramics \nexamined here are relatively simple in composition, this approach is a potentially powerful \nmeans of mapping the distribution of coarse grains of different mineral types. Moreover, if the \nstimulation source was confined to visible wavelengths only, it is possible to map both quartz \nand feldspar distribution by using a pulsed stimulation source and analysing the data in the \ntime domain. \n \n4. Conclusions \nThe results described in this paper demonstrate the capability of a scanning technique to \nperform mapping of OSL from minerals located in the exposed surface of cut specimens and \nto selectively stimulate areas to produce OSL decay curves. The ability to determine the \nabsorbed dose within a selected area of a ceramic surface provides an important advance for \nuse in retrospective dosimetry. While on one hand the occurrence of a small number of \nluminescing areas is a disadvantage in terms of spatial resolution of absorbed dose \ndeterminations, the brightness of the luminescing areas in the brick types tested allowed the \nmeasurement of absorbed doses as low as ~0.1 Gy in \u2018spot\u2019 locations.  When combined with \npulsed laser stimulation and a time-resolved detection technique, the system has the capability \n 15\nto differentiate between feldspar and quartz in mixed mineral samples using a single (visible) \nstimulation wavelength.  On the basis of previous TRL studies more sophisticated mineral \nidentification may be possible. Given the recent availability of compact pulsed laser sources \nand luminescence readers able to measure single grain ,wider access to measurements of this \ntype is now feasible.   \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe work described in this paper was supported by the University of Durham and the \nEuropean Commission within its 5th Framework Programme (1998-2002), Nuclear Fission \nand Radiation Protection, under Contract N\u00b0 FIGD-CT-2000-00094.
