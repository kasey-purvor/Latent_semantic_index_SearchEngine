Background3\n4\nProviding wholesome, affordable and safe drinking water that has the trust of5\ncustomers are the overarching goals of the water utility sector. The sector has publicly6\nstated8 that achieving this requires, at a minimum, that water is safe in microbiological7\nand chemical terms; that it is acceptable to consumers in terms of taste, odour and8\nappearance; and that the supply is reliable in terms of quality and quantity. Delivering9\nthese objectives in the context of an increasingly demanding consumer and regulatory10\nenvironment, under constraints imposed by ageing infrastructure and the trend11\ntowards financial self-sufficiency is challenging. Many within the industry, spurred12\non by developments in international regulation and guidance, are now promoting a13\nbusiness-wide approach to risk management as a means to ease and exploit this14\ntransition (e.g. Lifton and Smeaton82). In practice, water quality managers and15\ninternal audit functions within the sector are working more closely to address issues of16\nbusiness risk and many of the larger international water companies now have \u2018group17\nrisk managers\u2019 in place to manage business and consumer risks within a single18\nportfolio. Implementation of this business-wide approach to risk management is not19\nstraightforward, however - it requires:12120\n21\n(i) integrated frameworks for the management of internal risks (e.g. from22\nageing infrastructure) and external risks (e.g. from \u2018competitor\u2019 actions) to23\nthe utility;24\n(ii) the support of Board level, executive management and operational staff as25\nwell as that of external stakeholders; and26\n3(iii) the effective communication of risk and engagement within decision-1\nmaking processes both within companies and with external stakeholders.2\n3\nFurthermore, as illustrated in this review, there are potential tensions between4\nmanaging the risks of a commercial water business and the overarching public health5\ngoal of the water industry, stated above. Critically in this regard, the transition to an6\nexplicit risk management philosophy within the water utility sector is now reflected in7\nrecent revisions to the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) Guidelines for Drinking8\nWater Quality.167,168,45 This is placing an emphasis on the development and9\nimplementation of \u2018water safety plans\u2019 for water quality management and, within10\nthese, the application of risk frameworks and risk tools such as the \u2018hazard analysis11\nand critical control points\u2019 (HACCP)34,64 approach as a basis for prioritising risk12\nmanagement measures within the water supply chain from catchment to tap. The risk13\nmanagement approach is becoming increasingly embedded within utilities and with it14\na maturing view of risk analysis, shifting from that of a one-off technique to \u2018placate\u201915\nregulators towards that of a practical methodology to facilitate process control,16\noptimisation and corporate decision-making within a cost-effective framework.17\nDespite a growing consensus, there remain significant barriers to the implementation18\nof risk management within utilities. These can be categorised as business-related, the19\nchallenge of integrating risk management within organisational cultures and decision-20\nmaking processes (e.g. Pollard et al.121); and technical, relating to the selection and21\napplication of risk analysis tools. One of the key difficulties all organisations face in22\nimplementing risk management is managing the interfaces between high level23\ncorporate objectives, business plans and operational reality. Here then, we critically24\nreview the risk analysis strategies and tools and techniques available for risk analysis25\nwithin the sector, with particular emphasis on decision-making at the corporate26\n4(strategic), business (programme level) and operational levels in water utilities.1\nNecessarily the discussion requires excursions into the management and technical2\nenvironmental literature. However, we view the juxtaposition of these aspects of risk3\nmanagement as central to providing a well-round examination of the prior art in the4\ncurrent context of its application within the sector.5\n6\n7\nB. Risk analysis and decision-making8\nBefore entering a discussion on risk analysis, we must be clear in our9\nterminology. In simple terms, risk is widely accepted to consist of a combination10\nof probabilities and consequences. However, further clarity is required. Adapting11\nHrudey\u2019s68 elaboration, we consider the notion of risk to be a prediction or12\nexpectation that involves:13\n\u2022 an agent with the potential to cause either harm and\/or benefit (e.g. a14\nchemical contaminant, or an investment opportunity);15\n\u2022 uncertainty of occurrence and outcomes (expressed by the probability or16\nlikelihood of occurrence);17\n\u2022 consequences (the possible outcomes);18\n\u2022 a specified time frame.19\n20\nThe exploration of these facets provides us with an analysis of risk (note that the21\nauthors consider the terms risk assessment and risk analysis to be interchangeable).22\nRisk is inextricably linked to uncertainty. Thus uncertainty analysis plays a23\nprominent role in many risk analysis strategies. Finally, and in a distinct business24\ncontext, we consider risk management as the sum of the constituent sets of socio-25\ntechnical decisions and actions taken by staff to optimise their organisation\u2019s exposure26\nto risk.27\n5Risk analysis plays a role alongside other decision tools for risk management.1211\nDetailed risk analysis is not a prerequisite for effective risk management. In many2\nindustries there are accepted standards of performance and codes of practice (e.g.3\nengineering standards; accepted best practice; Figure 1) that, if adhered to, provide4\nhigh degrees of control. These are applied in familiar and well-characterised5\nsituations where uncertainties and system vulnerabilities are well understood.6\nHowever, complex, uncertain and novel systems, that deviate from routine operation,7\nmay require risk analysis, so as to better understand what drives the risk from or to the8\nplant, process or operation, thereby allowing management measures for the reduction9\nof unacceptable risks to be targeted for greatest effect.121 This principle extends10\nbeyond the operation of technical systems to embrace all aspects of managing a11\nbusiness. This said, risk analysis is, in many respects, a practitioner-driven discipline.12\nIts application within water utilities has its roots firmly in the protection of public13\nhealth from pathogens afforded by the multiple barrier approach to raw water14\ntreatment. Whilst the extension of risk analysis to asset management, water supply15\nsecurity and catchment (watershed) management is clearly evident, these applications16\nand the use of risk-based techniques for optimising treatment plant performance, on-17\nsite energy use, maintenance programmes and compliance monitoring regimes can18\ninadvertently but easily detract from and confuse the principal purpose of the water19\nsupply industry \u2013 to provide wholesome, affordable and safe drinking water that has20\nthe trust of customers. In all these applications this goal must remain paramount.21\n22\n23\nC. The risk hierarchy24\n25\n6The organisational hierarchy that exists even within \u2018flat\u2019 organisations requires1\nthat risks are actively managed at the strategic, programme and operational levels of2\nan organisation (Figure 2). Typically, there are split accountabilities for these risks3\nsuch that the chief financial officer \/ financial director and Board have overall4\nresponsibility, supported by an internal audit or control function for the management5\nof strategic risks; executive and senior management address programme level risks6\n(e.g. asset management, maintenance planning); and operational (e.g. site) managers7\nbear responsibility for operational risks (e.g. treatment plant performance).121 A range8\nof strategies exist for assessing and managing these risks in a business context. The9\nfocus in this review is sector-specific, addressing \u2018process\u2019 risk analysis (i.e. risks at10\nthe operational and programme level), but in establishing a business-wide context for11\nthis activity we also draw upon the experiences of organisations assessing risk at the12\nstrategic level.13\n14\n15\n2. STRATEGIC RISK ANALYSIS16\n17\nWithin an overarching context of public health protection and the maintenance18\nof process reliability, utility managers are increasingly concerned with managing the19\nrisks inherent to corporate level decision-making. Critical issues include decisions on20\noutsourcing asset maintenance, billing and monitoring, the management of change,21\nstaff retention, the long-term viability of investment decisions, and the management of22\nexternal interfaces with regulators and \u2018competing\u2019 utilities. Risk analysis tools are23\navailable to inform decisions on these issues (Table 1).24\n25\nA. Regulatory risk26\n27\n7Throughout the 20th Century, the central role of water quality to the protection1\nand preservation of public health encouraged governments to manage utilities within2\nthe public sector.138 Regulation was historically self-imposed and limited in scope,3\nand, by extension, posed relatively low risk to municipalities and utilities (in terms of4\nboth the likelihood of non-compliance and the associated penalties). In contrast, more5\nrecent (since the 1980s) regulatory pressures and drives to impose market discipline6\non the sector, whether directly (privatisation) or by proxy (e.g. corporitisation or7\nrequired self-sufficiency), have externalised and broadened the role of regulatory8\nscrutiny and intervention. Here our discussion is largely restricted to economic9\nregulation.10\nA concept of regulatory risk is difficult to grasp. Parker114,115 contends that it11\narises from the nature of the regulatory rules and practices, with rules determining the12\nextent to which interventions are discretionary, and practices relating to the13\ninterpretation the regulators and others (particularly government) place on the rules.14\nKilpatrick and Lapsey75 consider regulatory risk as the uncertain impact of regulatory15\ndecisions on regulated companies. Regulatory risk may best be considered as a16\ncombination of the above interpretations, encompassing both the uncertainty of the17\ndecision-making process and of its impact on utilities.18\nThe core issues of regulatory risk are: regulatory independence; regulatory19\ndiscretion; transparency and accountability. Independence is critical to minimising20\nthe risk of political interference in a regulatory regime. For example, in England and21\nWales, the economic regulator (the Office of Water Services; Ofwat), acting in the22\npublic interest, is vested with a high degree of autonomy from central government,23\nensuring that the regulatory process is not subject to direct political interference. In24\ncontrast, in South Australia (SA), the state government directly controls the tariff25\nsetting process, and as the dividend from SA Water is a significant contributor to the26\n8state budget, there is the danger that political considerations, as well as commercial1\nones, might be perceived to influence regulatory pricing.72\nRegulatory discretion refers to the freedom afforded to regulators to interpret3\nthe importance of set duties and objectives and to determine how best to accomplish4\nthem.114,75 In the UK, Ofwat\u2019s Director General is free to identify and change the5\nimportance attached to set objectives within the regulatory system, within broadly6\ndefined constraints.114 Arguably, the greater the discretion afforded to the regulator,7\nthe greater the uncertainty related to future regulatory decisions. Ofwat\u2019s regulatory8\npractices are characterised by high levels of transparency and accountability. In9\npractice, utilities are fully engaged in regulatory decision-making, with avenues for10\nconsultation and appeal established should companies wish to challenge the outcome.11\nSimilarly, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, which regulates all investor-12\nowned utilities in the State, publishes reports on its activities and is transparent and13\naccountable in its decisions and processes.7 These arrangements compare to the14\nGerman system. Water and sewerage in Germany is the responsibility of the15\nmunicipalities and the municipalities regulate and manage the water supply based on16\nEuropean, national, state and municipal legislation. Though many are satisfied with17\nthese relationships, there has been criticism in a recent report,7 where regulatory18\ndecisions were viewed as being taken in a closed fashion with little clear19\naccountability.20\nThe nature of a regulatory system (i.e. its objectives and the systems in place for21\ntheir achievement) represents a core strategic risk for water utilities. For example, in22\nmany developing countries, regulatory scrutiny is largely confined to ensuring a safe,23\nsecure water supply,7 which, whilst introducing inherent operational risks, does not24\ninvoke strategic uncertainty. In contrast, main goal of Ofwat is to facilitate25\n9competition within the sector, an objective that introduces utilities to a range of1\nhitherto unknown risks.2\nQuantitative treatments of regulatory risk within the literature are restricted to3\nex-post analyses of the relationship between utility share price volatility and the4\nregulatory process. Buckland and Fraser19 modelled variations in the systemic5\n(market) risk, using a variable \u03b2 (which measures the variability in returns of a stock6\nrelative to the variability of the broader market), of UK water utilities over time,7\nexamining the extent to which observed variations were associated with the regulatory8\nprocess. A key finding was the surge in the market\u2019s assessment of the systemic risk9\nto the industry accompanying the \u2018surprise\u2019 result of the 1992 general election. The10\nauthors\u2019 analysis illustrates the influence of politics in even the most independent of11\nregulatory systems. Similarly, Morana and Sawkins98 modelled the London stock12\nmarket\u2019s response to the 1994 \u2018periodic review\u2019 of water price setting in the England13\nand Wales utility sector, finding a significant reduction in share price volatility, which14\nthey postulated to be a reflection of shareholder confidence in the credibility and15\nsustainability of the settlement.16\nIdeally, for the active management of regulatory risk, analyses should extend to17\nex-ante treatments of risk. This is of particular relevance to the modern water utility18\nsector, where widespread structural reforms are requiring utilities to operate under19\nrapidly evolving regulatory systems \u2013 creating unprecedented uncertainty. In such a20\nmarket, there has been no historical evolution and the participants, including the21\nregulatory institutions, have a limited understanding of how it will operate in the short22\nterm and evolve in the future.78 In such situations, analytical models may offer value23\nin alerting utilities to unintended consequences of their actions that may trigger the24\nregulator into reaction.78 Larsen and Bunn78 argue that system dynamics, which25\nincorporates systems thinking into simulation modelling, is conducive to the dynamic,26\n10\nuncertain and subjective nature of assumptions inherent to strategic analysis. To1\nillustrate, Bunn et al.20 developed a system dynamics model to simulate regulatory2\nproblems in the restructured UK gas and electricity markets. Following problem3\ndefinition and hypothesis formulation, the authors constructed a simulation model4\ndescribing the main feedbacks involved in the exercise of \u2018latent\u2019 market power.5\nTheir analysis explored the relationship between corporate strategies designed to6\nexercise this power and the risk of regulatory scrutiny. The authors concluded that7\nmarket mechanisms were open to exploitation. Such analysis, and assessments of8\nsystem sensitivity, could provide utility managers with a priori insights into9\nopportunities for exploiting market \u2018imperfections\u2019, thus aiding the development of10\ncorporate strategies.11\n12\n13\nB. Competition risks14\n15\nComparative competition16\n17\nOn account of the water industry\u2019s inherent monopolistic nature, many18\ngovernments and their regulators have sought to expand the role of sectoral19\ncompetition. None more prominently perhaps than in the UK, where the concept of20\ncomparative competition underpins the regulatory regime.137,135 The theory of21\ncomparative, or \u2018yardstick competition\u2019 may be traced to the work of Shleifer,143 who22\nproposed a regime in which the price (or financial rewards) received by a regulated23\nfirm depends not on its costs (as in traditional \u2018cost-of-service\u2019 or \u2018rate-of-return\u201924\nregulation), but rather on the costs of \u2018identical\u2019 firms operating within the same25\nsector. Shleifer reasoned that by breaking the dependence between the price a firm26\n11\nreceived and its own costs, and ensuring that the rewards for a given firm depended1\non its standing vis-\u00e0-vis a \u2018shadow firm\u2019 (a weighted average of other firms operating2\nwithin the sector \u2013 an idealised benchmark), each firm would be forced to \u2018compete\u20193\nwith its shadow, providing incentives for cost efficiency (widely perceived as lacking4\nfrom rate of return regulation). In practice, the inherent risks of this \u2018competition by5\nproxy\u2019 pale in comparison to those found in fully liberalised markets because market6\nshare is not directly threatened.7\nTechniques for evaluating the \u2018explicit\u2019 risks posed by competitors have been8\nwell developed in the business and economic literature. A notable example is9\ncompetitor analysis, with its potential to reduce the uncertainty of the price review10\nprocess (as price setting is linked to competitor performance). Its application is11\nhelped by the tendency for regulatory bodies to disclose company performance data in12\nthe interests of transparency. In addition to reducing uncertainty, competitor analysis13\nrepresents a strategic tool which assists managers in: evaluating competitors\u201914\nstrengths and weaknesses; identifying sources of competitive advantage; and15\nassessing the implications of competitors\u2019 strategies on both the sector and their own16\nutility.38,13317\n18\nCapital market competition19\n20\nAs Cowan27 contends, competition in the capital market can be thought of as a21\nprivate-sector version of yardstick regulation, in that it derives from the ability of22\ninvestors to make comparisons between different companies in the same sector.23\nLittlechild,85 in his report to the UK Department of the Environment on the prospects24\nfor water privatisation, emphasised that this would be an important incentive25\nmechanism for utilities, as inefficient firms would be reflected in their share price and26\n12\nbe vulnerable to take-over, in addition to facing higher costs of capital. Although1\nOfwat\u2019s restrictions on mergers within the UK water sector, in the interests of2\nmaintaining sufficient comparators, act as a constraint on capital market3\ncompetition,27 the growing internationalisation of the industry increases the risk of4\n\u2018external\u2019 mergers, whilst firms looking to diversify remain a threat to existing5\nutilities.6\nFurthermore, the quality and quantity of comparative information available7\nunder the \u2018yardstick\u2019 system assists predators in identifying and assessing potential8\ntake-over targets.136 Singh and Harianto,145 in reviewing the acquisition literature,9\nsurmised that profitability, size, leverage, and dividends were negatively correlated10\nwith the risk of being acquired. In contrast, profitability and liquidity were positively11\ncorrelated with the probability of a firm acquiring, with leverage and dividends12\nnegatively so. In light of this information, the dynamic risk of take-over can be13\ntracked both in real-time (e.g. with respect to the transfer of, for example, more than14\n5% of firm stocks to a potential acquirer and, in the US, the filing of 13D statements15\nindicating investor intent) and pro-actively (by \u2018screening\u2019 the external environment16\nfor trends and potential hostile bodies). Of further interest to corporate strategists,17\nrecent research by Dickerson et al.35 suggests that acquisition can be used as a18\nstrategy to reduce the risk of take-over. The researchers concluded this strategy19\nallows firms to grow quickly, thus protecting them from subsequent take-over. For20\nutilities considering expansion or diversification strategies, take-over represents not21\njust a threat but also an opportunity.22\n23\nCompetition for the market24\n25\n13\nAnother means of fostering competition is to encourage the private sector1\n(perhaps along with the incumbent public utility) to bid competitively for a2\nconcession, lease, tender, or management contract.27 The two key vehicles for doing3\nso are franchising and, more conservatively, contracting out (not involving the4\ntransfer of assets). Numerous variants of these processes are adopted internationally,5\nincluding: build, operate and transfer (BOT) arrangements; finance, operate and own6\n(concession); and operate and provide working capital (affermage). The inherent7\ncomplexity of many of these arrangements, the generally low equity in the project8\nvehicle,55 and the often significant investment obligations required of the sponsor,9\ncreate a pressing need for comprehensive risk assessment.10\nThe project and financial risks associated with public-private partnerships have11\nbeen reviewed by Grimsey and Lewis.55 Using the financing of Stirling Water, a12\nScottish design-build-operate contractor as an illustrative example, they discuss the13\ncomplexity of the contractual arrangements within such partnerships and use a14\nquantitative analysis of returns on investment to characterise the robustness of cash15\nflows from each of the senior lenders to this joint public-private venture. From the16\nprocurer\u2019s perspective, project risks (e.g. delays and claims) are valued and17\nincorporated within the NPV calculation, whilst the impact of financial risks (inflation18\nand interest rate changes) are evaluated through sensitivity analysis. From the19\nsponsor\u2019s perspective, risk analysis centres on simulating the effect of the underlying20\nvariables (e.g. operating performance) upon the equity return. Ranasinghe128 uses21\nwater supply projects in Sri Lanka to outline a methodology based on financial risk22\nanalysis that a government or public utility can use to assess the viability of private23\nsector participation in new infrastructure projects. The author links a commercially24\navailable simulation package to the financial model to analyse the uncertainty25\nassociated with the underlying variables (e.g. escalation in cost).26\n14\n1\nProduct market competition2\n3\nThe traditional approach to introducing direct product market competition into4\nutility services has been to separate the monopolistic component of the industry and5\nregulate it, and to encourage competition in all other areas, e.g. the UK model of6\nseparating the gas, electricity and railway networks (monopolistic) from the supply of7\nservices over the network.27 This so-called \u2018vertical disaggregation\u2019, although8\npromoted by the World Bank,172 has not been widely adopted in the water sector, the9\nimplicit assumption being that the industry is naturally monopolistic.27,138 The UK10\nhas led the way in adopting alternative approaches to facilitate product market11\ncompetition. This can be traced back to the 1991 Water Industry Act, which12\nintroduced the concept of \u2018Inset\u2019 appointments, whereby a utility can apply for an13\nappointment to provide water to a \u2018large\u2019 customer located within the statutory area of14\nan existing company, usually by seeking a bulk supply from the incumbent.6515\nSawkins136 reports that the first Inset appointment was granted in May 1997, when16\nAnglian replaced Essex and Suffolk Water (ESW) as the supplier to Buxted Chickens17\nLtd. Company licences were altered and a new pipe constructed linking the site with18\nan Anglian water main.19\nIn practice, various restrictions, recently eased, have meant that this form of20\ncompetition has been slow to develop.136 Similarly, although the 1992 Competition21\nand Service Act allows for cross-border competition, the costs are prohibitive in the22\nmajority of cases. Perhaps the most significant recent development has been the23\nintroduction of the 1998 Competition Act, which created the possibility for common24\ncarriage agreements, or network sharing, in the water industry. Here, the shared use25\nof an incumbent\u2019s infrastructure by a third party enables the latter to provide services26\n15\nwithin the incumbent\u2019s area. To aid this, Ofwat now requires that all water utilities1\npublish \u2018Access Codes\u2019 that set out their terms and conditions for common carriage,2\nand has published guidance on this procedure.110 Hern65 reports that under the Act,3\nutilities risk infringement if they refuse access to any parts of their infrastructure4\ndeemed \u2018essential\u2019 without objective justification, or if their access terms are5\nconsidered unreasonable. Although no successful applications for common carriage6\nhave resulted to date, the threat alone acts as a catalyst for performance7\nimprovements.8\nThe authors were unable to uncover literature quantitatively addressing the risks9\nof product market competition within the water utility sector, a reflection of its10\nnascent development and descriptive nature. It seems appropriate here, however, to11\nintroduce an oft-neglected truism: quantitative risk analysis is not a prerequisite of12\neffective risk management. This is apt in addressing the threats introduced by13\nproduct-market competition, where competitor identification and analysis, in concert14\nwith a critical appraisal of self-performance and room for improvement, often provide15\nan appropriate foundation for minimising competitive threats. In contrast, harnessing16\nthe opportunities presented by product-market competition requires more detailed17\nanalysis, and in the absence of a relevant body of literature, the authors suggest18\ntreating what are effectively, at least in the UK model, potential acquisitions of19\ncompany operations in the manner of strategic investment decisions.20\n21\nC. Business process re-engineering risks22\n23\nOur discussion thus far has focused on the strategic approaches to risk24\nmanagement within the sector. The pressures described are having important impacts25\non the performance of the water sector. Structural changes to utility markets, an26\n16\nincreasingly demanding political and consumer environment, and more stringent1\nregulation are requiring utilities to improve financial and operational efficiencies. As2\nWesterhoff166 notes, water utilities are responding by rethinking their operations,3\nfinding new ways to address problems, and revamping traditional business models \u20134\nin other words, re-engineering. According to Clemons,23 major business process re-5\nengineering (BPR) initiatives \u2013 which range from the redesign of existing processes6\nfor efficiency improvements, to the development of novel processes in support of a7\nnew corporate vision \u2013 require the commitment of substantial resources and often8\nconstitute a lasting legacy. If we define the risk of a project as the deviation in results9\nfrom the established goals, then there is substantial empirical evidence marking BPR10\nas a high risk endeavour. Many, if not most re-engineering efforts ultimately \u2018fail\u201911\n(see Crowe et al;28 Remenyi and Heafield130). Of particular relevance is the work of12\nDean et al.,31 whose analysis of change programmes undertaken in the UK water13\nindustry suggests that re-engineering efforts, whilst often effective, produce highly14\nvariable outcomes. On account of this, project risk analysis should be an integral part15\nof any re-engineering effort.16\nClemons23 considers the core determinants of the risk profiles associated with17\nlarge scale BPR efforts to be: (a) functionality risk \u2013 the risk of making inadequate or18\nincorrect changes to systems or processes; and (b) political risk \u2013 the risk that the19\norganisation will not complete the project, either because of significant internal20\nresistance to the proposed changes or due to a more gradual loss of will. Clemons21\npromotes scenario planning \u2013 a strategic planning tool that embraces uncertainty \u2013 as22\na means for assessing and subsequently managing the risks associated with re-23\nengineering efforts. Rather than determining a single \u2018correct\u2019 view of the future with24\nits implicit single response, scenario planning acknowledges the key sources of25\nuncertainty and incorporates these in developing a range of future scenarios and26\n17\nstrategic responses for exploration. Clemons argues that its use is suited to the1\ncontext of re-engineering efforts as it encourages the critical examination of potential2\nfutures and strategies, reduces functionality risk and helps ensure the need for change3\nis internally addressed and accepted, thus reducing political risk. Scenario planning4\nhas been embraced by the majority of UK water utilities.120 A 2001 study120 explicitly5\nlinked the tool\u2019s use with improved financial performance on the part of utilities,6\nalthough notably the authors suggest that scenario planning may implicitly encourage7\nfirms to focus on financial returns at the expense of customer service levels.8\nRecent work by Crowe et al.28 has led to the development of a semi-quantitative9\ntool for estimating the \u2018risk of failure\u2019 of companies about to undertake re-engineering10\nefforts. The tool, developed through a survey of BRP-experienced organisations, is11\nbased on measures of the core success (e.g. egalitarian leadership; collaborative12\nworking environment; top management commitment; and change management13\nsystems) and failure (middle management fear of losing authority; fear of job loss;14\nscepticism; discomfort of new working environment) factors of implementing change.15\nRaw data is extracted by questionnaire (e.g. \u2018\u2018do managers usually share vision and16\ninformation with their subordinates\u2019\u2019 is used to mine information on the general17\nleadership style), and refined via fuzzy mathematics. Crowe et al.\u2019s model is intended18\nto provide companies with an estimate of the likelihood of success or failure of19\nproposed efforts prior to committing resources and to improve management\u2019s a priori20\ninsights into the potential outcomes of re-engineering. Similarly, Remenyi and21\nHeafield130 outline a methodology for evaluating the key risk issues relating to re-22\nengineering efforts. The methodology centres on a risk matrix (Table 2) that groups a23\nvariety of potential BPR risks under the categories of business risk, financial risk,24\ncorporate structure, corporate culture, technology and human. Organisations identify,25\nweight and rank what they consider to be the ten factors most pertinent to their26\n18\nproposed re-engineering efforts. The framework represents a succinct method for1\nappraising and comparing the risks associated with BPR strategies. A perceived2\nfailure of much of the BPR literature is the limited emphasis placed on the risks3\nintroduced by adopting new technologies, an aspect critical to many re-engineering4\nefforts.5\n6\nTechnological risk7\n8\nClark et al.22 report that technology adoption is increasingly becoming a9\nconcern of strategic planners and policy makers within the water industry. The10\nintroduction of novel technology poses risks due to the inherent difficulty of preparing11\naccurate estimates of the costs, performance and system-wide effects of new12\ncomponents and processes; and the long development cycles required for changes in13\nregulations and consumer demands.26 This has led many researchers to advocate the14\nincorporation of risk management techniques for the effective implementation of new15\ntechnologies (e.g. Colmer et al.26; Fitzpatrick47). This is highly relevant to the water16\nsector, where, as Maxwell91 notes, the advance of modern technology is illustrated by17\nsuch trends as the replacement of traditional methods of water treatment with18\nadvanced oxidation and other novel physical and mechanical technologies; the broad19\nuse of membrane systems to desalinise seawater for human consumption; and the20\nincreasingly widespread use of recycling systems and technologies.21\nMcGaughey et al.92 describe a framework for viewing and comparing the risks22\ninherent in the adoption of new technologies, specifically relating to IT. Initially,23\nproposed projects are assessed, through value chain analysis, in terms of their24\npotential positive and negative outcomes \u2013 these are then mapped onto a \u2018speculative\u201925\nrisk matrix to provide management with an initial screening of alternatives. In later26\n19\nstages of planning, specific threats and opportunities associated with the project are1\nidentified and ranked, by likelihood and consequence, for prioritisation purposes.2\nHartmann and Lakatos62 drew on case studies monitoring the pace and quality of3\ntechnology delivery within two product development programmes and generated an4\nalgorithm characterising the risk of each technology problem (Figure 3). The authors5\nsuggest that its use can aid in the refinement of technology development and6\nimplementation plans following risk identification. Hartmann and Lakatos define7\ntechnology problems as those arising:8\n9\n\uf0b7 from the application of a new process, material or subsystem before fully10\nunderstanding parameters that control cost, latitudes and failure modes;11\n\uf0b7 when a previously commercialised technology is extended outside the12\nknown domains of the pertinent design rules; and13\n\uf0b7 from unexpected interactions arising from a new or unique combination of14\nknown subsystems of components.15\n16\nOf further interest, the authors62 developed a checklist to help technology and17\nproduct developers audit technology progress, which we have adapted to serve as a18\ntool for minimising the risk associated with introducing new technologies (i.e. beyond19\nthe development stage):20\n21\n\uf0b7 Implementation goals confirmed22\n- validate business assumptions and technology specifications for cost,23\nperformance and reliability24\n\uf0b7 Technology mastery demonstrated25\n- critical parameters identified26\n20\n- failure modes identified1\n- set risk tolerances relating to the critical parameters so as to avoid2\nfailure modes and deliver the required performance3\n- performance demonstrated using a combination of hardware and4\nmathematical simulation5\n- manufacturing feasibility established6\n\uf0b7 System specifications re-established7\n- system and subsystem financial and operational performance targets8\nare re-established and re-assessed based on technology specifications9\n\uf0b7 Additional assessments completed10\n- supporting assessments completed, such as safety and environmental11\nimpact study12\n\uf0b7 Contingency planning13\n- develop contingency plans should critical risks materialise in spite of14\ncontrol procedures in place15\n16\nWildemann170 describes a framework for guiding technology planning. Risk17\nprofiles are constructed displaying the relative importance of identified threats and18\nopportunities, and thus the inherent \u2018attractiveness\u2019 of the technology, complemented19\nby a strengths-weaknesses analysis that estimates the ability of the firm to20\nsuccessfully implement the technology. The author\u2019s aim was to provide an analytical21\nbasis upon which strategies may be developed for the introduction of new22\ntechnologies.23\n24\n25\n21\nD. Outsourcing risks1\n2\nOur discussion of risk analysis strategies moves to one of the key features of the3\ninternational water business \u2013 outsourcing. A significant feature of water utility4\nmanagement in recent years has been the growth in outsourcing, defined as the5\ntransfer of previously in house activities to a third party. Outsourcing allows utilities6\nto focus on critical functions (core business), access economies of scale, minimise7\ninvestment, increase quality of service, transfer risk, and reduce administrative8\nburdens including regulatory compliance.116,42,36 Common candidates for outsourcing9\ninclude information technology, maintenance, distribution, manufacturing, and10\ncustomer care and billing.116 A widely held view is that the potential for outsourcing11\nis far from exhausted. A holistic approach to risk being promoted in this review12\nrequires that in addition to the traditional review of legal and regulatory13\nresponsibilities following contractual agreement, the process of outsourcing should14\nfall within the remit of corporate risk management. That is, outsourcing alters the15\nboundaries of the firm, and the scope of risk analysis and risk management16\nprogrammes should be extended to reflect this.17\nRisks are inherent in the process of outsourcing, from the decision to outsource,18\nto the management of agreed contracts. Received wisdom has been that companies19\nshould focus on \u2018core competencies\u2019 and outsource the remaining parts of the20\nbusiness (although the validity of this distinction has been questioned of late, notably21\nby Heikkil\u00e4 and Cordon63). The core risks discussed in the literature relating to22\ndecisions over what to outsource and who to outsource to include: the loss of key23\ncapabilities, developing dependence on the vendor, and risks linked to the service24\nprovider\u2019s deficient capabilities. Each decision to outsource must be carefully25\nassessed from a risks and benefits perspective.36 Decision-making frameworks are26\n22\navailable for this purpose. Lonsdale\u2019s86 decision tree for outsourcing provides a1\nframework for evaluating what constitutes an organisation\u2019s core competencies, and2\nanalysing market opportunities for outsourcing the remaining parts of the business.3\nThe framework seeks to ensure managers retain those resources responsible for4\ncompetitive advantage, avoid monopolistic or oligopolistic supply markets, and5\neffectively manage the risk of post-contractual dependency. A similar model,6\nalthough focussed at the policy level, is provided by Qu\u00e9lin and Duhamel.125 Of7\ncourse, successful outsourcing further depends on managing supply risks, defined as8\nthe transpiration of failures with in-bound goods and services.176 Core categories of9\nsupply risk discussed in the literature include: the financial stability of the supplier;10\ncost fluctuations; capacity constraints of the market and specific suppliers; variations11\nin quality; the ability of the supplier to adapt to required changes in design or12\ntechnology; and natural disasters. Two diametrically opposed approaches to13\nmanaging supply risk are the active management of risk interfaces with the intention14\nof reducing vendor failures,176 and the construction of barriers (e.g. safety stock,15\nmultiple sources) to buffer the effects of inherent uncertainties.46,104 Tools in support16\nof the former approach include qualitative assessments of the financial stability of17\npotential suppliers; formal models for the demonstration of supplier capacity18\nperformance; \u2018what-if\u2019 scenario planning; and statistical process control to detect19\ndeviations from desired quality.17620\n21\n22\nE. Employee retention23\n24\nRetaining valued employees has long been an implicit component of good25\nutility management. The recent emphasis on people as the resource, along with the26\n23\nexternal realities of an increasingly dynamic and pressurised labour market, have led1\nto the sector embracing employee retention as a critical risk issue \u2013 particularly in the2\ntechnically specialised areas of the water business. This focus is exemplified in recent3\nsectoral research initiatives (e.g. American Water Works Association Research4\nFoundation (AwwaRF) project #2850 \u2018Succession planning for a vital workforce in5\nthe information age\u2019), and a recent (2001) policy statement from AWWA calling on6\nutilities to establish formal employee retention plans.7\nMaintaining employee retention, thus managing the risk of losing organisation8\ncapacity, begins at the recruitment stage (e.g. Barney,9 McNally,94 Denton33).9\nEmpirical evidence suggests that ensuring a \u2018cultural match\u2019 between employees and10\nthe organisation plays a critical role in reducing staff turnover.141 The tool applied by11\nSheridan141 to \u2018measure\u2019 culture (beliefs and values) was the Organisational Culture12\nProfile (OCP) instrument developed by O\u2019Reilly et al.109 The OCP assesses13\ncandidates by encouraging them to sort value statements on: norms regarding the14\ncompletion of work tasks; norms regarding interpersonal relationships; and norms15\nregarding individual actions. Utilising the OCP as a part of the recruitment process16\ncould provide utilities with a proactive tool for minimising staff turnover, by filtering17\nthose most likely to leave the organisation early from the selection process.18\nAdditionally, it enables the risk-based targeting of retention efforts, for example by19\nfocusing efforts on employees hired regardless of \u2018cultural misfit\u2019.20\nThis philosophy is mirrored in the work of McNally,94 who promotes the use of21\nmore traditional tools such as personality assessments at the recruitment stage to22\nensure \u2018good fits\u2019 of personality and work ethic. As Denton33 notes, whilst \u2018\u2018good23\nrecruitment is certainly important, it is what happens to recruits after joining an24\norganisation that determines whether a company will retain them.\u2019\u2019 In relation to25\nthis, McNally94 encourages organisations to develop \u2018early warning systems\u2019 to26\n24\nidentify employees at risk of leaving. Such a system requires the collection and1\nanalysis of retention data by subgroup (e.g. ethnicity, gender, function, organisational2\nlevel, etc.) to facilitate identification of \u2018at-risk\u2019 groups. Following identification,3\ntools such as employee surveys, employee reviews, mentor or manager feedback,4\nlocal economic trends, head-hunter activity, and, crucially, the exit interview may be5\nused to determine factors driving high rates of defection.94 Adherence to such a6\nsystem would provide utilities with comprehensive data on who is leaving and why,7\nproviding the foundation for developing effective, tailored retention strategies. A8\nrecurrent theme of the retention literature is that incentives (e.g. salaries and benefits)9\nalone are not enough for achieving high levels of retention, the contention being that10\nretention is related more closely to employee development and intrinsic benefits such11\nas working relationships, job satisfaction and a sense of empowerment (e.g.12\nHagevik;60 McNally;94 Thompson;158 Denton33). Accordingly, utilities may consider13\nundertaking a gap analysis of their employee development schemes (interestingly,14\nBrueck18 reports that water utilities spend as little as 1% or less of their labour budget15\non nonmandatory employee training) and benefit programmes before remedying16\ndeficiencies in order to minimise turnover rates. An alternative approach to17\nidentifying the level of retention risk is to undertake an informal risk assessment418\nwhich is essentially a checklist addressing the core issues influencing turnover (e.g.19\nemployee-manager relationships, communication, job satisfaction, etc.).20\nThe negative consequences of employee turnover are clearly emphasised21\nthroughout the literature, leading to the implicit assumption that organisations should22\n\u2018pull out all the stops\u2019 to minimise defection rates. However, as Sigler144 and23\nMowday100 contend, the costs of reducing retention may, in some cases, exceed the24\nbenefits to be derived. It is thus incumbent on organisations to critically analyse the25\n25\ncosts and benefits of implementing retention strategies; the cost-benefit analysis1\napproach offers a promising framework for this purpose.2\n3\nF. Assessing investment risks4\n5\nBehind each strategic investment an organisation considers lies some6\ncalculation of the move\u2019s worth.87 Following Rothstein and Kiyosaki,134 we define7\nstrategic investments as those resource allocations that will yield substantial advances8\ntoward the achievement of a utility\u2019s strategic goals. Whether considering a joint9\nventure, acquisition, or a major extension of an existing facility, how the utility10\nestimates value is a critical determinant of how it allocates its resources, which is in11\nturn a key driver of its overall performance.87 Valuation methodologies range from12\nthe formal (comprising an appraisal model and a supporting theory) to the informal13\n(based on heuristics).87 However, since the 1970s there has been a trend towards14\napplying valuation methods that are more formal, explicit, and institutionalised.87 The15\nmost widely adopted framework is the Net Present Value (NPV) model, which16\nestimates value by capitalising (discounting) future streams of cash flow that the17\ninvestor expects to receive from an asset. The capitalisation rate is the minimum18\nexpected rate of return needed to induce an investor to acquire. Capitalisation is19\ncomprised of two components, the risk-free rate of return (accounting for the time20\nvalue of money) and the risk premium (the additional compensation demanded by21\ninvestors for assuming risk). Although issues have been raised regarding the22\napplicability of conventional appraisal methodologies to the water industry,23\nspecifically relating to the long lifespans of many capital projects and the fact that24\nthey often do not generate revenues in the traditional sense (e.g. Tebbutt et al.155),25\nthey remain favoured by academics and industrialists. Our subsequent discussion26\n26\nfocuses on three distinct investment problems: valuation of assets-in-place; valuation1\nof \u2018opportunities\u2019; and the valuation of joint ventures.2\n3\nAssets-in-place4\n5\nThe most basic valuation problem is valuing assets-in-place, i.e. the valuation of6\nan ongoing business or some part of one, for the purposes of informing decisions7\nranging from a change in suppliers to an acquisition.87 It is for such situations that8\nDiscounted Cash Flow (DCF) techniques (methodologies for determining the9\ncapitalisation rate) are suited.87 In brief, the established DCF methodologies include10\nthe weighted-average cost of capital (WACC),97 the capital asset pricing model11\n(CAPM)140 and the adjusted present value (APV).102 The WACC, which establishes12\nthe risk premium on the basis of the \u2018cost of capital\u2019 financing the investment,13\nremains the most commonly practised approach,87 though is increasingly criticised in14\nacademic circles (e.g. Luehrman;87 Gregory54). The fundamental idea behind CAPM15\nis to use \u03b2, a measure of systemic (market) risk, to adjust cash flows. In contrast,16\nAPV seeks to unbundle the various components of value (i.e. cash flows), analyse17\nthem separately, and then add up the present values. For a fuller discussion of these18\nand other DCF techniques see e.g. Modigliani and Miller,97 Sharpe,140 Myers,102 Berry19\net al.,12 Gregory,54 Luehrman,87 and Ye and Tiong.17320\nRegardless of the individual strengths and limitations of the above models, a21\ncommon deficiency is that there is no indication of the confidence level on the22\ndetermined capitalisation rates.173 Following on from Hertz,66 who highlighted the23\nmisleading nature of single-point estimates in investment analysis, most researchers24\nadvocate the appraisal of investments within a non-deterministic framework; the25\nprinciple being that investment forecasts are, by definition, uncertain. Reflecting this26\n27\nuncertainty in model outputs lends some assurance to the decision-makers that the1\navailable information has been used with maximum efficiency.66 This is reflected in2\nGuidelines published (1999) by the Asian Development Bank6 on the application of3\nfinancial evaluation methodologies to water supply projects. Risk analysis, in the4\nform of sensitivity analysis and stochastic simulation, is promoted as a means to5\nexamine the influence of changes in key underlying variables on forecast cash flows,6\nand the probability that project NPV will fall below zero. Incorporating these7\nprinciples, Barriex et al.10 describe the application of the NPV framework to the8\nproposed restructuring, privatisation and optimisation of water utility operations in9\nPanama. The focus of their study is on the proposed rehabilitation of systems10\nsupplying water to Arraijan, Chorrera, Colon and Panama City, a \u2018holistic\u201911\nprogramme entailing the upgrading of commercial, technical and operational aspects.12\nThrough stochastic simulation and sensitivity analysis of forecast financial returns, the13\nauthors confirmed the project\u2019s robustness from a financial standpoint, determining a14\n\u2018zero\u2019 probability of negative NPV.15\nThomas157 uses an illustrative example to examine the role of CAPM in16\nadjusting for the risk inherent to acquisition \/ diversification appraisals (using internal17\nrate of return (IRR), an appraisal framework similar to NPV). Accounting for the18\nunique nature of acquisition \/ diversification appraisals, the author provides a19\nmethodology for integrating expected financial and operational synergies (e.g. derived20\nfrom financial and operating economies, or the pooling of functional areas) within the21\nanalysis. However, through applying a risk premium to projected cash flows (which22\nby definition accounts for the increased returns investors demand for variable cash23\nflows) and undertaking simulation of the variables influencing future cash flows (thus24\nexplicitly modelling the variability of returns), Thomas157 is effectively \u2018double25\ncounting\u2019 for risk, introducing a bias against investment decisions. This criticism is26\n28\nsupported in the work of Burchett and Tummala,21 who apply Monte Carlo simulation1\nto an NPV based appraisal of an infrastructure capital investment decision. These2\nresearchers argue that applying specific probability distributions to the relevant3\nvariables captures all potential risks relating to the investment, thus negating the4\nrequirement for incorporating a risk premium as part of the capitalisation rate.5\nAlthough it is widely accepted that a probabilistic approach to investment risk6\nanalysis is desirable, problems exist. As Songer et al.148 assert, the failure to identify7\nall significant risks (i.e. to apply appropriate probability distributions to all relevant8\nunderlying variables) quickly undermines model validity and output. A further pitfall9\nis identified by Mosca et al.,99 who in applying simulation methodologies to a10\nproposed plant investment, found that the choice of frequency distribution chosen11\n(often arbitrarily) for the independent variables can have a marked effect on the12\nprocess outcome. These are important observations in that they highlight the biases13\ninherent to all risk models, reminding of us of the need to use risk analysis output14\ndiagnostically rather than to over-invest belief in quantitative risk estimates.15\nIn financial circles, recent times have seen an increasing adoption of tools that16\ncan perform economic evaluation and modelling on the combined entity of17\ninvestments (portfolio) as well as for each individual project. This trend extends18\nbeyond the financial sphere, as is illustrated in the work of Rothstein and Kiyosaki,13419\nwho describe the application of portfolio management theory to water utility20\ninvestment planning. The philosophy of their approach is to create a portfolio21\nrepresenting a balanced array of investments that mitigate uncertainties and that are22\nlikely to realise potential returns. Of particular interest is their use of multi-attribute23\nanalysis, which allows the risk-based prioritisation of monetary and non-monetary24\ninvestment decisions within a single analytical framework.25\n26\n29\n1\nOpportunities2\n3\nIt is relevant here to further discuss the work of Luerhman,87 who categorises a4\nsecond type of valuation problem \u2013 the valuation of opportunities (i.e. possible future5\noperations) \u2013 as distinct from the valuation of operations (assets-in-place). The6\ndistinction is that with the former, the decision to invest may be deferred. In7\nopportunity valuation, risk matters in two ways: the risk of the investment, and the8\nrisk that circumstances will change before a decision has to be made \u2013 such9\ncontingencies are not well handled by the traditional DCF approach.87 Luerhman8710\nstates that a common approach in the valuation of opportunities is simply not to value11\nthem formally until they mature to the point where a decision can no longer be12\ndeferred, where they can then be valued, in effect, as assets-in-place. Critics have13\ndecried this practice, on the premise that it leads companies to undervalue the future14\nand hence underinvest.87 In response, Luerhman87 discusses the potential of \u2018option-15\npricing theory\u201914 - an analytical strategy that allows managers to handle the16\ncontingencies created by the time-dependant nature of opportunity valuation - as a17\nsupplement, not a replacement, for the valuation method for in place assets.18\n19\nJoint-ventures20\n21\nA further category of investment decisions is found where firms participate in22\njoint ventures, partnerships, or strategic alliances. This takes on particular resonance23\nin the water industry, where recent years have seen a proliferation in public \/ private24\npartnerships. In such cases, where ownership is shared with other parties, managers25\n30\nneed to understand both the value of the venture as a whole and the value of their1\ncompany\u2019s interest in it.872\nThe investment risks associated with public-private partnerships have been3\nreviewed by Grimsey and Lewis.55 Using the financing of Stirling Water, a Scottish4\ndesign-build-operate contractor as an illustrative example, apply quantitative analysis5\nof returns on investment from the perspective of the private (sponsor) and public6\n(procurer) sector entities.7\nA common observation of the risk management literature is an all too8\nobvious gap between theory and practice. Much of the highly theorized investment9\nliterature does not reflect standard industry practice, particularly that relating to the10\napplication of complex methodologies such as simulation and scenario analysis. The11\ndiscrepancy is explained, in part, in that such techniques do not fit naturally into most12\ncompanies\u2019 skill sets or capital-budgeting systems.87 Despite this, there is a dearth of13\nliterature focussing on the practicalities of integrating such tools deep within company14\nstructures. To address this issue and as part of the research that has informed this15\nreview, the authors will be undertaking a benchmarking of risk management16\ncapabilities within the international water utility sector.17\n18\n19\n3. PROGRAMME RISK ANALYSIS20\n21\nWe turn to a more familiar discussion of the application of risk analysis to the22\nwater utility sector. The revised WHO guidelines167 are promoting the implementation23\nof water safety plans for water quality management from catchment management,24\nthrough process control, distribution and on to the tap.160 Application of risk analysis25\nto these aspects of the water \u2018supply chain\u2019 extends to programmes of work as well as26\n31\nindividual plant operations. A discussion of the latter, operational risk analysis1\nfollows, but here we are concerned with the analysis of risks associated with2\nprogrammes of activity that are \u2018rolled-out\u2019 across organisations, such as asset3\nmanagement and maintenance planning. Here, managers are responsible for the4\nimplementation of strategies across company functions, multiple sites and geographic5\nregions. They are concerned with: evaluating the risks posed by a similar hazard at a6\nvariety of locations (e.g. mains bursts, network intrusion \u2013 in asset management, for7\nexample); the risk-based appraisal of operational strategies and long-term planning in8\nrelation to the water supply-demand equilibrium; and the wide variety of risks9\nexisting within a catchment or watershed. Table 3 summarises the portfolio of10\nanalysis techniques available at the programme level.11\n12\n13\nA. Asset management14\n15\nIn line with Booth and Rogers,16 we consider asset management as \u2018\u2018managing16\ninfrastructure capital assets to optimise the total cost of owning and operating them17\nwhile delivering the service levels customers desire.\u2019\u2019 Managing risk in the face of18\nlimited resources has long been an implicit component of asset management. Within19\nthe UK, pressure from the economic regulator has ensured that the explicit20\nincorporation of risk analysis into asset management programmes has taken on added21\nmomentum. Water utilities are expected to:22\n23\n\u2018\u2018demonstrate how the flow of services to customers can be maintained at least24\ncost in terms of both capital maintenance and operating expenditure, recognising the25\n32\ntrade off between cost and risk, whilst ensuring compliance with statutory duties\u2019\u20191\n(Ofwat letter MD 161, April, 2000).2\n3\nIn addition to regulatory pressures, the global trend towards requiring financial4\nself-sufficiency on the part of public and private utilities has created a climate in5\nwhich management can no longer seek to \u2018over-engineer\u2019 facilities with the6\npresumption of screening out technical risk. A recent (2004) report163 to the US7\nSenate cites \u2018\u2018mounting evidence suggest[ing] that the integrity of the nation\u2019s8\n[water] infrastructure is at risk without a concerted effort to improve the management9\nof key assets\u2026and a significant investment in maintaining, rehabilitating and10\nreplacing these assets\u2019\u2019. The report goes on to explicitly endorse the role of risk11\nanalysis in asset management. More than ever, utilities must now seek to balance12\nspending with risk minimisation. A risk-based approach to asset management13\nrequires an integrated, systematic process drawing upon a broad range of14\nmethodologies for the identification, analysis and prioritisation of assets-at-risk, from15\nthe process to the component level (e.g. Lifton and Smeaton;82 Booth and Rogers16).16\nOn a national scale, the US Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC)10617\nrecently (2003) reported on the risk to drinking water quality from ageing pipes and18\nprocess plant across the US with individual city \u2018rankings\u2019 being informed by water19\nquality data, USEPA compliance records and water utility annual reports. Many20\nwater companies have in place risk-ranking procedures to evaluate and rank potential21\nrisks across a variety of categories, and thus help inform and prioritise risk22\nmanagement procedures.121 For example, Radovanovic and Marlin126 describe the23\nrisk-based approach to water mains asset management in place at Sydney Water24\n(Australia). Budgetary requirements are estimated through the application of25\nKANEW, a statistically based survival model which aids the calculation of pipe26\n33\nrehabilitation and replacement needs for distribution networks. The identification of1\nspecific pipes requiring work is external to the model, with separate approaches for2\ntrunk and reticulation mains (the latter generally being run to failure). Critical trunk3\nmains are identified by means of a checklist-aided screening approach, wherein4\npreliminary assessments of failure likelihood and consequence are combined to create5\nan overall risk score. This combined risk score is used to identify critical water mains6\ndeemed to require more detailed analysis (e.g. condition-based assessments). This7\nmethodology allows Sydney Water to identify and prioritise water mains in need of8\nrehabilitation \/ renewal, and to proactively assess budgetary requirements.9\nLouisville Water Company (Kentucky) apply their Pipe Evaluation Model,10\nwhich integrates data such as pipe age and maintenance history, as a tool for11\nprioritising pipe and water mains for rehabilitation and replacement.163 Utility12\nmanagers report that this model, in combination with wider asset management13\npractices, has helped reduce the frequency of water mains breaks from 26 to 22.7 per14\nhundred miles and the frequency of joint leaks from 8.2 to 5.6 per hundred miles.16315\nSeattle Public Utilities adopt a risk-based approach to asset management, considering16\nlikelihood and impact of pipe rupture with reference to such factors as age, material,17\nlocation and historical cost of repair.163 Drawing upon this analysis, utility officials18\nwere able to delineate their pipe network into areas of critical and non-critical risk,19\nand allocate maintenance and rehabilitation resources accordingly. Through adopting20\nthis approach, officials believe that they are using staff resources more efficiently and21\nthat, over time, the programme will lead to a reduction in maintenance costs.16322\nKent et al.73 describe how risk analysis informs the prioritisation of investment23\nstrategies for trunk main maintenance at Dwr Cymru Welsh Water. The methodology24\nis based on the available records of asset performance, condition and serviceability,25\nwhich are stored on the company\u2019s WAM (Water Asset Management) database.26\n34\nSTRUMAP, a software-based mapping system, allows clustered failures to be1\nconsidered separately from \u2018random\u2019 bursts, a task performed as the former are2\nconsidered likely to be representative of underlying susceptibilities. For each location3\nwhere a cluster is identified, specific failure rates are derived. For random bursts,4\nfailure data is separated according to pipe material and diameter, with failure5\nlikelihood determined by group. STRUMAP further enables consideration of failure6\nconsequences, in terms of the number of properties potentially affected by an event,7\ntaking into account service reservoir storage. Failure likelihood and consequence are8\nthen combined to derive an overall severity score, which in turn informs the9\nderivation of investment requirements. The National Research Council of Canada are10\ncurrently developing a prototype Water Mains Renewal Planner (WARP),127 which is11\naimed at integrating the most promising breakage analysis models into one discrete12\ndecision support tool. At present, WARP consists of three modules: a) analysis of13\nwater main breakage patterns; b) short-term operational forecasting; and c) long-term14\nrenewal planning. A fourth module is to be added to enable prioritisation of15\nindividual water mains for renewal.16\nFoster et al.50 detail a risk-ranking approach for estimating the relative17\nlikelihood of failure of embankment dams by piping. Failure likelihood is assessed by18\nweighting the historical frequency of piping failure with respect to dam zoning, filters,19\ndam age, core soil types, compaction, foundation geology, dam performance, and20\nmonitoring and surveillance. The methodology allows the prioritisation of dams-at-21\nrisk for more detailed analysis, and is further offered as a check on traditional event-22\ntree methods (see also Seker et al.139).23\nFailure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), developed by the US military, is an24\nengineering technique that tabulates failure modes of equipment and their effects on a25\nsystem1 (Table 4). The failure mode describes how equipment fails (open, closed, on,26\n35\noff, leaks, etc.). The failure effect is determined by the system\u2019s response to the1\nequipment failure. When FMEA is extended by a criticality analysis, it is known as2\nfailure modes, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA).3\nLifton and Smeaton82 detail how Scottish Water apply source-to-tap FMECA4\nstudies across their water supply systems as part of their \u2018asset management toolkit\u2019.5\nThis allows priority risks to be identified and subsequently compared across the utility6\nportfolio (e.g. various mains, raw and treated reservoirs, treatment works etc.) in order7\nto focus attention on the most serious threats to system performance. Infrastructure8\ninvestment strategies are further informed by the HYSIM-AQUATOR supply-demand9\nmodel. Of particular interest is their description of the asset risk and criticality10\nscoring system implemented at Scottish Water. The system is designed to assess the11\nrelative \u2018total business impact\u2019 of asset failures across the company by reference to a12\n\u2018common currency of risk\u2019 (one point equates to \u00a31000 of business impact),13\nfacilitating a consistent approach to risk scoring across Scottish Water. Additionally,14\nthis scoring system guides the prioritisation of reliability studies at the operational15\nlevel, which further informs asset management strategy.16\nGiven the complexity inherent in describing modes of structural failure and17\nassessing their likelihoods,53 logic models (visual risk schematics, e.g. reliability18\nblock diagrams, fault tree analysis (FTA) and event tree analysis (ETA), see Figures 419\nand 5) have found application in support of asset management. Parr and Cullen,11720\nthrough examining the applicability of logic modelling techniques to dam failure21\nanalysis, illustrate how such an approach can inform the prioritisation of expenditure22\non monitoring, maintenance and remedial works. Similarly, Gray and Powell5323\npromote the use of logic diagrams in aiding the development of risk-based strategies24\nfor maintaining asset security. The authors model the interactions leading to failure25\nfor each class of aqueduct structure. To this, historic data, or where data is deficient,26\n36\nengineering judgement, are applied in order to derive failure probabilities. A1\ncautionary note is sounded by Latiffe,79 who contends that risk analysis, specifically2\nlogic modelling, is not yet effective in modelling dam failure. The author cites3\ninsufficient statistical data on the deficiencies of structural components as the core4\ndrawback.5\n6\nSpatial context of risk7\n8\nGeographic Information System (GIS) technologies now play a critical role in9\nasset management. At its most basic level, GIS allow utilities to convert data10\nordinarily displayed on paper maps into one single, easily accessible digital format,11\nrepresenting an excellent method for storing and collating data for future use.49 The12\nlevel of detail (i.e. the layers of spatial data) contained within such systems varies13\nwidely. Kaufman and Wurtz72 describe the evolution of a GIS for a small utility14\n(Beecher Water District, Michigan). An extensive inventory of asset condition15\nrecords and failure and maintenance data is collated within the system, supporting the16\nrisk-based planning of capital improvement and maintenance works. Pertinently, the17\nsystem took only three months and less than $3,000 to develop. Similarly, Booth and18\nRogers16 illustrate how the implementation of GIS technologies within an asset19\nmanagement decision support system can allow for the visual tracking of20\ninfrastructure assets and their associated risk factors.21\nAlthough applications of GIS technologies in support of asset management have22\nproven to be powerful risk-tracking, visualisation and communication tools,16 they23\nrarely utilise the capabilities of GIS to spatially analyse data in the classical sense.4924\nDoyle and Grabinski37 illustrate these capabilities through quantitatively relating25\nToronto\u2019s infrastructure deterioration to spatially variable corrosion risk factors,26\n37\nproviding a basis for the identification of network areas most at risk from external1\ncorrosion. Such an approach may allow utility managers to better focus rehabilitation2\nefforts through having a more complete understanding of the causative factors behind3\nwater main deterioration. Of further interest is the work of Ta,153 who describes the4\napplication of a probability model for burst risk studies of water mains. Contributing5\nfactors (e.g. pipe number density, pipe age, material and diameter, soil corrosivity,6\netc.) are represented as GIS data layers and correlated with past failure data in order to7\ndeduce burst probability scores for each water main. The tool, developed for Thames8\nWater Utilities Ltd. (UK), is not intended to predict the likelihood of pipe bursts,9\nrather to aid utilities in sourcing the origin of an area burst (i.e. following a pipe burst10\nin the area, the value of probability evaluated for a particular pipe section would11\nindicate the likelihood that the burst actually occurred at that section).12\nWhile GIS represent powerful tools for spatial data analysis, their inherent13\ncapabilities for complex and dynamic analysis are limited.152,43 In contrast, traditional14\nsimulation models are powerful tools for complex and dynamic situations, but often15\nlack the intuitive visualisation and spatial-analysis functions that GIS offers.152,4316\nConsequently, researchers have sought to couple these systems. Lindley and17\nBuchberger83 describe the integration of hydraulic modelling within a GIS for the18\npurpose of assessing intrusion susceptibility in distribution systems. The holistic19\nmethodology enables the synthesis of multiple risk factors describing the three key20\n(geographically variable) susceptibility conditions of adverse pressure gradient,21\nintrusion pathway, and contaminant source, thus identifying areas susceptible to22\nintrusion (accidental or intended). Susceptible locations are then prioritised for23\nattention by considering how they are hydraulically connected to local sensitive24\npopulations. In addition to informing asset management programmes, this framework25\nmay also be applied in a reliability context at the design stage. Similarly, Besner et26\n38\nal.13 illustrate via case study how the coupling of a GIS containing structural,1\noperational and water quality parameters with simulation model EPANET facilitates2\nthe identification of key factors responsible for water degradation in the distribution3\nnetwork. Through identifying network areas presenting the greatest risk, this4\ntechnique can inform the prioritisation of risk management strategies.5\n6\n7\nB. Catchment management8\n9\nThe concept of catchment (or watershed) management has gained widespread10\ninternational support, representing a shift from the sole reliance on end-of-pipe11\ntreatment technologies for point sources towards the watershed-specific prioritisation12\nof water quality problems and their integrated solution.48 An outcome of this is that13\nthe assessment of hazards to the quality of water resources within a catchment is14\nincreasingly subject to formal risk assessment and can be expected as part of routine15\nwater safety plans.160,161,167 In Europe, the DPSIR approach to identifying key16\nhazards within a watershed, by reference to the driving forces (e.g population growth),17\npressures (sewer discharge), state (increased nutrient load), impacts (anthropogenic18\neutrophication) and policy response (discharge control) is being adopted under the19\nEuropean Water Framework Directive.70 Here, risk assessments of activities posing a20\nan actual or potential threat to the quality of water bodies in \u2018river basin districts\u2019 are21\nintended to inform and help prioritise a programme of multi-agency action plans22\ntargeted at raising the overall ecological status of the watershed within statutory23\ntimescales. Given the plethora of potential catchment management issues in any24\nimprovement programme, there is a need to prioritise risk management efforts within25\nthe watershed by concentrating on those measures that reduce the significant26\n39\nlikelihood of severe impacts being realised. Southern Water (UK) adopt a semi-1\nquantitative ranking scheme in screening their groundwater sources for2\nCryptosporidium contamination risk, as described by Boak and Packman.15 The3\nmethodology consists of ranking source waters across ten risk categories (e.g. land4\nuse) using pre-determined scoring hierarchies (e.g. occasional livestock grazing: 2),5\nbefore combining these category rankings into an overall weighted risk score.6\nThrough this approach the utility identifies those sources deemed to be at significant7\nrisk of oocyst contamination, and which therefore require continuous monitoring (in8\nline with regulations).9\nGiven the improved capabilities and functionality of modern GIS and their10\ninherent ability to map and analyse data that is spatially variable in nature, many11\ncatchment-level ranking methodologies have sought to incorporate their benefits.12\nVarious authors 88,146,169,49,111,51 describe the use of map overlay techniques (which13\nessentially combine the attributes of two or more data layers across geographic space)14\nin the identification and mapping of areas critical to catchment water quality. These15\nrisk-mapping (essentially spatial risk-ranking) methodologies centre on the analysis of16\nthose spatial attributes considered to play a significant role in pollutant transport (e.g.17\ngeology, rainfall, soil type, agricultural activities etc.) according to pre-defined18\nformulae (e.g. a weighted runoff-potential index). Their focus may be generic or19\ntargeted towards specific hazards (e.g. animal feeding operations) or pollutants (e.g.20\nthrough incorporating measures of their leaching potential).21\nRisk-ranking methods are applied to help target more detailed analysis towards22\ncritical risks and to inform the prioritisation of catchment management activities,23\nspecifically monitoring programmes. Of course, the potential exists that as the costs24\nof planned monitoring decrease on the one hand, the risks may increase on the other.25\nWhen designed well, piloted and implemented with feedback, risk-based resourcing26\n40\nstrategies (Figure 6) can provide a sound basis for distinguishing greater risks from1\nlesser ones, and for investing resources in risk management that are proportional to2\nthe risks posed.1223\nMost critically, however, these risk-based optimisation tools, whether intended4\nto drive monitoring regimes, maintenance schedules or workforce planning, may5\nthemselves incur significant risk unless the consequences of resource trade-offs are6\nthemselves assessed. Consider the actions of the Saskatchewan Department of7\nEnvironment and Resource Management (SERM) prior to the North Battleford8\ncryptosporidiosis outbreak in April 2001.121 SERM held legislative responsibility for9\nthe Saskatchewan drinking water programme and, partly in response to budget cuts in10\nthe mid 1990s, drastically reduced the already limited field inspection and11\nenforcement of municipal utilities. This culminated in SERM proposing to eliminate12\nits drinking water programme altogether, a motion tentatively approved by the13\nTreasury Board in 2000\/01 and justified as being \u2018risk-based\u2019. The subsequent North14\nBattleford outbreak, infecting between 5800 to 7100 persons in the immediate15\ncommunity plus a large number of visitors from three other provinces, led to a public16\ninquiry into the outbreak and the provincial drinking water regulatory system. Justice17\nLaing76 concluded in his Inquiry report: \u201cthat the current risk-based model employed18\nby SERM since 1996 is arrived at on the basis of economics, and has nothing to do19\nwith how best to safeguard the health of the population, all of whom consume water\u201d.20\nThe example aptly illustrates the inappropriate use of risk analysis as a justification21\nfor the removal of processes critical to public health protection. Tensions that arise22\nbetween those seeking economic efficiencies and preservation of the principal goal of23\nproviding safe drinking water are often played out in the conflicting expectations and24\npresumed purposes of risk analysis made by different professionals. The real25\nconsequences of stripping away levels of safety, precaution and protection using \u2018risk26\n41\nanalysis\u2019 as a justification can be to render the system as a whole less safe, more1\nprecarious and more susceptible to catastrophic failure and so optimisation2\nprogrammes, maintenance schedules and risk-based monitoring require special3\nscrutiny as to the balance between risk and the full cost of implementing these4\nprogrammes.5\nWhere more detailed analysis is deemed necessary, a common recourse is to6\nmodel-based approaches. Water quality and flow \/ transport models represent core7\ntools for this purpose, due to their combined ability to model the dispersal of8\npollutants and predict the resultant deterioration of water quality. Aside from the9\ninherent value of fostering an increased understanding of catchment water quality10\nissues, the core benefits of model-based analysis stems from their ability to test11\nmanagement scenarios (through e.g. sensitivity and scenario analysis), thus enabling12\ninformed decisions on how best to manage the resource. A range of models are13\navailable that apply to catchment risk analysis, from micro to landscape scales, from14\ndeterministic to stochastic approaches (Table 3).15\nCommon practices of hydrological and water quality modelling have been based16\nmostly on deterministic analysis, producing single point estimates that neglect17\nprediction uncertainty.2 Determinism has been embraced by many risk analysts, for18\nexample, G\u00fcnd\u00fcz et al.56 describe the use of the combined hydrodynamic and water19\nquality model CE-QUAL-W2 in projecting potential water quality degradation20\npatterns under different pollution loads. The tool is intended to aid management in21\nthe development of appropriate strategies for the management of water quality.22\nSimilarly deterministic approaches to catchment analysis are described by various23\nother researchers (e.g. Cole et al.25). The limitations of determinism in risk analysis,24\ndiscussed earlier, are particularly relevant in the context of hydrological and water25\nquality modelling, considering the often scarce or incomplete data available.89 This26\n42\nuncertainty takes on particular importance from the utility standpoint, as their1\nassessments of catchment water quality are performed with regard to set regulatory2\nstandards. To illustrate this point, the uncertainties inherent in flow and contaminant3\ntransport modelling (from e.g. spatial variability, data scarcity, model imperfections)4\nimply that there will always be a risk of exceeding a given standard at some point5\nover space or time following a pollution event, regardless of the estimated single-6\npoint (mean) contaminant levels.27\nAn argument can thus be forwarded for the explicit consideration of prediction8\nuncertainties in catchment level risk modelling. There exist two dominant approaches9\ntowards this task: stochastic modelling; and deterministic modelling allied with10\nuncertainty analysis of the output. Adopting the former approach, Andersson and11\nDestouni2 outline the application of stochastic transport modelling to quantify the risk12\nof exceeding regulatory standards for groundwater at any point on the compliance13\nboundary. This quantification is coupled with an analysis of the abatement costs14\nrequired to attain an \u2018acceptable\u2019 risk level. Halfacree,61 for example, describes the15\nuse of PRAIRIE, an aquatic dispersion modelling tool for assessing chemical16\npollution risks to water bodies. The main elements are an aquatic dispersion model;17\nhydrological, substance and standards databases; and a tabular \/ graphical output18\nfacility. The model has a deterministic mode used to \u2018screen out\u2019 low risk sites, and a19\nprobabilistic mode for more detailed analysis of high risk sites. The output results20\n(e.g. frequency versus concentration curves) are compared with pre-determined21\ncriteria to inform regulatory actions on risk management from hazardous activities22\nwithin a sensitive catchment. An advantage of the stochastic approach is that23\nuncertainty is interwoven within the model.175 However, the solution of stochastic24\nequations is often impractical for complex problems.81 This explains, in part, the25\n43\npreference for deterministic approaches to water quality \/ hydrological modelling,1\ncreating the subsequent need for external consideration of output uncertainty.2\nIn this context, uncertainty analysis is performed to estimate the probability of3\nobtaining a given output value when uncertainties on input variables and parameters4\nare known.89 Liou and Yeh84 outline the use of a groundwater transport model in5\nderiving the risk of contaminant concentration exceeding a maximum acceptable6\nupper limit (e.g. regulatory standard). The analytical uncertainty of the predicted7\ncontaminant concentration is derived by first-order mean-centred uncertainty analysis,8\nprior to the application of Monte Carlo simulation in order to compute the mean risk9\nand associated confidence interval of exceeding standards. For detailed discussions of10\nthe forms of uncertainty in water quality modelling and the techniques for their11\nanalysis, see Mailhot and Villeneuve;89 Portielje et al.;123 and Beck.1112\nIn the event of pollution leading to a violation of water quality standards,13\nremediation may be required. Researchers have developed methodologies for14\noptimising remediation strategies (e.g. Rogers et al.132). However, as Latinopoulos et15\nal.80 contend, if the inability to meet the constraints of a groundwater quality16\nprogramme is considered a significant risk, then quantifying the risk of remediation17\nfailure in terms of failure to comply with regulatory standards is a primary task. In18\nrelation to this, Latinopoulos et al, through coupling stochastic flow and transport19\nsimulations with a risk-cost-benefit objective function, have developed a methodology20\nfacilitating the risk-based evaluation of remediation strategies (costing the risk of21\nfailure in terms of regulatory fines and the need to import \/ develop alternative22\nsupplies).23\nAn alternative approach to characterising the extent and severity of source24\ncontamination is that of geostatistical inference (e.g. Passarella et al.;118 Wingle et25\nal.;171 Rautman and Istok129). These kriging methods \u2013 essentially a form of least26\n44\nsquares linear regression \u2013 focus on providing an estimate of a spatially distributed1\nvariable (e.g. contaminant concentration) at unsampled locations as a function of a2\nlimited set of sample values taken from surrounding locations.129 As such, they are3\nideally suited to groundwater quality issues, where data collection is limited by4\nexpense and access. Of particular relevance to risk analysis is the discipline of5\ngeostatistical simulation, where multiple, unique estimates of site conditions that6\nmimic the random variability of the parameter(s) of concern are produced.171 Various7\nauthors118,171,129 have illustrated how such an approach may answer the following8\nquestions: what is the probability that contaminant levels exceed regulatory standards;9\nwhere are the compliance boundaries (and what is the associated level of confidence);10\nand how much contaminant is present (and hence, how much must be removed)?11\nAlthough the principles of geostatistical simulation are well established, the technique12\nhas yet to be widely applied to problems of groundwater contamination.12913\nApplications of GIS to catchment risk analysis were discussed earlier in the14\ncontext of risk-mapping. Although representing efficient risk screening tools, their15\nability to quantify risk over space and time is limited. To counter this, researchers16\nhave sought to integrate these systems with simulation models. Feijtel et al.4417\nillustrate that the embedding of chemical fate prediction models within a GIS allows18\nfor calculation of the distribution of predicted environmental concentrations, both in19\nspace and time, of \u2018down-the-drain\u2019 chemicals in catchment surface waters. Similar20\napproaches are adopted by Dabrowski et al.30 and Verro et al.164 to assess surface21\nwater pesticide loading.22\n23\n24\nC. Network analysis25\n26\n45\nA water distribution system may be viewed as an interconnected collection of1\nsources, pipes, and hydraulic control elements (e.g. pumps, valves, regulators, tanks)2\ndelivering water to consumers in prescribed quantities and at desired pressures.1123\nSystem behaviour, which is governed by hydraulics, supply, demand, and system4\nlayout, may be described mathematically.112 This description forms the basis of water5\nsupply and distribution modelling (network analysis), a discipline practised in the6\nwater industry for many years, particularly to inform the development of operational7\nstrategies.154,17 Water utilities routinely apply network analysis in order to assess their8\n\u2018security of supply\u2019, defined as the probability of being able to meet consumer9\ndemands (i.e. network reliability). \u2018Best practice\u2019 utilities extend their analysis10\nbeyond routine operating conditions to examine network performance under various11\nsupply-demand scenarios, thus reflecting the inherent uncertainty of the supply-12\ndemand balance. The standard Scottish Water methodology of yield assessment uses13\nthe software tool HYSIM-AQUATOR.82 HYSIM, a hydrological rainfall-runoff14\nsimulation model, is used to derive historic inflow series, based on historic rainfall,15\npotential evapotranspiration, and if necessary any artificial influences (e.g.16\nabstractions). AQUATOR, a water resource system model, uses the output from17\nHYSIM to simulate reservoir storage based on system demands and compensation18\nflows. The model assists Scottish Water in understanding the level of supply19\navailability risk in the current system and in determining the impact of prospective20\ninvestment strategies to mitigate this risk.21\nStevens and Lloyd150 describe the application of the resource modelling package22\nWRAPsim, with reference to the Yorkshire Water (UK) Grid. The model contains23\nover 1200 components including all river and reservoir sources, boreholes, water24\ntreatment works, pipelines and demand centres. Through simulation of the25\nconjunctive use of Yorkshire Water\u2019s sources over a given time period, model output26\n46\nprovides the decision-maker with an accurate assessment of the behaviour of each1\nsource, its ability to meet demand, and the frequency of restrictions that would need to2\nbe imposed. Further insights are gleaned through the application of scenario analysis,3\nwherein the supply-demand balance for each zone under variable scenarios (e.g.4\naverage year, dry year, peak week, etc.) allows an assessment of security of supply5\nover a range of timescales and operating conditions. The authors report that6\nWRAPsim\u2019s ability to predict future supply conditions, to optimise allocation of water7\nresources, and to rebalance stocks, has significantly increased the yield and reliability8\nof Yorkshire Water\u2019s supply system.1509\nStahl and Elliott149 discuss Essex and Suffolk Water (ESW)\u2019s use of the risk-10\nbased resource planning and operational support model DROP (Drought Reliable11\nOutput Programme), an adaptation of WRAPsim designed to accommodate the12\nutility\u2019s specific technical requirements. The model has been applied in a variety of13\nareas, particularly in support of investment planning and the determination of14\noperational strategies. The authors state that DROP has enabled ESW to improve15\ntheir understanding of system performance, identify new schemes or short term16\noptions to improve reliability of supply, and to more accurately determine future17\noperating costs associated with new developments. Such methodologies, although18\nable to examine system reliability under a range of operating conditions, do not19\nadequately address whether the system is sufficiently reliable, as this requires the20\ndefinition and quantification of appropriate and meaningful reliability measures, a21\ncomputationally difficult task.113 Harnessing developments in computer processing22\npower and operability, Ostfeld113 has developed a methodology for the explicit23\nreliability analysis of water distribution networks, with reliability defined, quantified24\nand measured as the probability of zero annual shortfalls. The methodology, whose25\ndevelopment was funded with the intention of practical application by the Israeli26\n47\nWater Commission, is comprised of two interconnected stages: (i) analysis of the1\nstorage-conveyance properties of the system; and (ii) implementation of stochastic2\nsimulation through use of RAPTOR (Rapid Availability Prototyping for Testing3\nOperational Readiness) software.4\nHowever, researchers in the field of network analysis are increasingly aware of5\nthe need to take account of both the frequency and severity of modelled failures, and6\nas a result analyses are often suggested to extend beyond measures of reliability to7\nincorporate resiliency (e.g. the capacity of a system to recover to a satisfactory state8\nfrom a state of failure) and vulnerability (e.g. a measure of failure significance).165, 719\nAdopting this paradigm, Zongxue et al.174 describe the coupling of a risk model10\n(comprising measures of reliability, resiliency and vulnerability), which incorporates11\npredictions of water demand, with a traditional network simulation model. The12\napproach aids the identification of operational strategies of minimum risk under given13\nsupply and demand scenarios, and is illustrated by application to Fukuoka Water14\nSupply System, Japan (see also Jinno et al.71). Similar methodologies are described15\nby Wang et al.;165 Merabtene et al.;96 and Andreu et al.3 though supplemented with16\nformal optimisation procedures to assist derivation of the most appropriate operational17\npolicies of minimum risk.18\nTo summarise, network analysis can: (a) allow utilities to assess their19\nsusceptibility to various supply-demand scenarios (e.g. drought or increases in20\ndemand); (b) aid decision-makers in determining \u2018optimal\u2019 supply strategies and21\npolicies; (c) assist in the design phase of distribution networks; and (d) inform the22\nneed for capital expenditure.23\n24\n25\n48\nD. Vulnerability assessments1\n2\nOperational disruptions are the inevitable result of large-scale disasters (e.g.3\nflooding, drought, earthquakes, terrorism). To minimise the risks posed by such4\n\u2018uncontrollable\u2019 events, utilities must seek to eliminate or reduce their potential5\nconsequences \u2013 this is best achieved through contingency and emergency planning.1426\nThe role of formal risk analysis in emergency planning, long restricted to drought7\nmanagement, is now being widely adopted to address security risks. This is largely in8\nresponse to the events of September 11th, 2001. In relation to this, a methodology for9\nvulnerability assessments has been developed by Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)10\n\u2013 known as Risk Assessment Methodology for Water Utilities (RAM-W). The11\nmethodology allows utilities to conduct a detailed assessment of their system12\nvulnerabilities and to develop measures to reduce the risks and mitigate the13\nconsequences of terrorist or other criminal attacks.147 The assessment comprises three14\nsteps:14715\n16\n1) determine how well the system detects a problem, which involves17\nsurveying all security and monitoring features (e.g. how quickly could it18\ndetect an undesired chemical being introduced to the supply);19\n2) measure delay capabilities in order to determine how well a system can20\nstop undesired events (e.g. security in place, length of storage time); and21\n3) measure the capacity of private guard forces and local, state and federal22\nauthorities to respond to an event.23\n24\n49\nPerhaps a more pragmatic approach, particularly for smaller utilities, is found in1\nthe questionnaire-based self-assessment developed by the National Rural Water2\nAssociation.1073\n4\n5\n4. OPERATIONAL RISK ANALYSIS6\n7\nOur review now progresses to the analysis of individual plant. Operational risk8\nmanagers are responsible for the risks associated with specific operations at plant9\nlevel \u2013 for example, the risk of failure of a device or process component, or the risk of10\nexceeding a particular water quality standard and they are increasingly responsible for11\nthe health and safety of plant operatives. Analysis at this level is largely concerned12\nwith the \u2018classic\u2019 risk analysis methodologies developed and established within other13\nprocess industries, most notably the oil and chemical sectors (Table 5).14\n15\n16\nA. Public health and compliance risk17\n18\nHere, we are primarily concerned with the risk posed by specific contaminants19\nat the plant and distribution system level, particularly relating to the hazards posed to20\nhuman health and the related risk of exceeding regulatory standards. The multiple21\nbarrier approach to water treatment has been the central tenet of modern water22\ntreatment systems and relies upon the use of \u2018in-series\u2019 water treatment processes to23\nremove hazardous agents from the public water supply. Failure or inadequacy of the24\ntreatment and distribution process can result in an interruption of supply and \/ or25\nderogation in water quality (microbiological or chemical) with potential impacts on26\n50\npublic health. The underlying causes may include source contamination, human error,1\nmechanical failure or network intrusion. The consequences of process failure can be2\nimmediate, there is very little time if any to reduce exposure because of the lag in3\nsecuring monitoring data and the impacts can affect a large number of people4\nsimultaneously.121 Beyond the paramount impacts on public health through the direct5\ningestion of contaminated drinking water, financial and consumer confidence impacts6\ninvariably ensue. The financial costs to the community of the fatal Walkerton7\noutbreak for example, were in excess of Cdn$65 million, with one time costs to8\nOntario estimated at more than Cdn$100 million.108 Compounding this, the loss of9\nconsumer confidence following disease outbreaks is often enormous.67 Even when10\nthere is no legislation covering certain aspects there can be claims of negligence11\nagainst operating companies. Litigation for civil damages have been prominent12\nfeatures following both the Walkerton outbreak (settled out of court) and the Sydney13\nWater crisis (largely dismissed, costs still incurred).12114\nConventionally, the public health impacts of drinking water consumption have15\nbeen assessed retrospectively using epidemiological studies.69 Recognition of the16\nneed for a preventative approach to managing risk and providing safe drinking water,17\nhowever, has driven international interest in the application of risk assessment18\nmethodologies within the sector, for both chemical and microbiological hazards.5, 5919\nThe generic approach is based on the risk assessment framework developed by the20\nNational Academy of Sciences (NAS),103 which consists of four key steps:5921\n\uf0b7 problem formulation and hazard identification \u2013 to describe the human health22\neffects derived from any particular hazard (e.g. infection, carcinogenicity, etc.)23\n\uf0b7 exposure assessment \u2013 to determine the size and characteristics of the24\npopulation exposed and the route, amount, and duration of exposure25\n51\n\uf0b7 dose-response assessment \u2013 to characterize the relationship between the dose1\nexposure and the incidence of the health effects2\n\uf0b7 risk characterization \u2013 to integrate the information from exposure, dose-3\nresponse, and health interventions in order to estimate the magnitude of the4\npublic health problem and to evaluate variability and uncertainty5\n6\nSeveral substantive differences exist between assessment of risk of microbial7\nagents and assessment of risk of chemicals.58 Accordingly, the NAS approach has8\nbeen adapted to account for the dynamic and epidemiologic characteristics of9\ninfectious disease processes,45 to form what is known as quantitative microbial risk10\nassessment (QMRA). The application of these models has long been the basis for the11\nderivation of water quality guidelines for drinking water.168 The substance-specific12\nhealth risk assessments that have historically informed the guidelines may, however,13\nbe somewhat distanced from the immediate operational context of individual14\nutilities.121 However, recent work has extended the application of these models to the15\noperational (plant-specific) context. For example, Medema et al.,95 Masago et al.,9016\nand Teunis et al.156 describe the application of QMRA in determining the public17\nhealth risks posed by the presence of microbial contaminants in treated water. The18\nfirst step in the process is to define the relationship between measured pathogen19\nsource levels and the consumed dose (incorporating analytical detection levels,20\ntreatment removal efficiencies, drinking water consumption), followed by the21\nconstruction of a deterministic model mathematically describing this relationship.22\nMonte Carlo simulation (a method of uncertainty analysis) is then applied to the23\noutput of the deterministic model to determine the distribution of the daily consumed24\ndose, to which the relevant dose response relationship is applied in order to determine25\n52\nthe cumulative distribution of the probability of infection. From this, the mean annual1\nindividual risk of infection may be determined. Such approaches are of particular2\nrelevance in areas, such as the Netherlands, where water supply legislation expresses3\nacceptable health risks in terms of infections per year.95 Of course, core microbial4\nstandards generally refer to a maximum level of organisms in the treated water, and so5\nconsideration of consumption levels and the dose-response relationship is superfluous6\nto compliance risk assessment. The approach perhaps has most utility in \u2018what-if\u20197\nmode to answer questions such as: \u201cwhat are the public health implications of a8\nfailure of part of the treatment process or of a re-designing of the treatment9\nprocess\u201d.5210\nTools are available to assess the risk of exceeding water quality standards11\nrelating to physical or chemical parameters. For example, Demotier et al.32 describe12\nan integrated FTA \/ FMEA approach to determining the risk of producing non-13\ncompliant drinking water across a range of parameters, taking into account the quality14\nparameters of raw water and the removal efficiencies and reliability of the full set of15\ntreatment processes. Similar methodologies are described by Eisenberg et al.41 and16\nHaas and Trussell57 in assessing the reliability of multiple, independent barriers in17\nwater treatment. These three pieces of research explicitly consider the performance18\nvariability of individual processes along the treatment line, an approach rarely19\ndescribed in operational QMRA. Not only does this offer a more realistic appraisal of20\ncompliance risk, it is in line with recent proposals from regulatory bodies (e.g.21\nNational Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC))105 calling on utilities to22\nformally adopt the multiple barrier approach to risk management to ensure multiple23\nlevels of protection are afforded against specific contamination threats (see Rizak et24\nal.131).25\n53\nOf course, limitations in resources (human and financial) and in the data to1\nunderpin such sophisticated analyses often restrict the practical application of these2\nmore advanced methodologies within the sector. A more pragmatic analysis of the3\nrisks of process failure is commonly undertaken using a semi-quantitative risk-4\nranking of hazards according to their likelihood and consequence. Egerton405\ndescribes the application of ranking techniques for the prioritisation of contamination6\nrisks at a water treatment plant. Risks are scored according to the frequency with7\nwhich they may occur, the ability to take action to contain the event, and the8\nconsequence of subsequent contamination. The methodology is intended to aid the9\ntargeting and prioritisation of remedial actions. Such approaches rely heavily on the10\nexperience and judgement of the assessment team, and depending on the level of11\nguidance provided for scoring within these criteria, remain open to bias especially12\nfrom unforeseen circumstances that often fall beyond the process boundary, e.g.13\ndeliberate or accidental human error.14\nFinished water can undergo a variety of physical, chemical, and biological15\nchanges during transportation through a distribution system.13 Understanding the16\nnature and likelihood of these risks has become a priority for water producers,13 in17\npart due to research linking such degradation to the incidence of gastrointestinal18\nillnesses (e.g. Payment et al.119). Application of the methodologies developed by19\nLindley and Buchberger83 and Besner et al.,13 described earlier (see Asset20\nmanagement), would provide utilities with a means to distinguish areas of the21\ndistribution system at greatest risk of degradation, providing a framework for22\nprioritising risk management activities.23\n24\nB. Reliability analysis25\n26\n54\nIt is implicit in the planning, design and operation of water utilities that risk1\nanalysis is a qualitative component of the intellectual process of the experienced2\nengineer \/ operator. Reliability analysis seeks to formalise, systemise, and, where3\nnecessary, quantify this process. Assessments of operational reliability range from4\ncomponent (e.g. risk of valve failure), process (e.g. risk of failure of treatment step) to5\nnetwork (e.g. network reliability under drought conditions, see Network analysis)6\nlevel analysis. Regardless of focus, the aim is to identify the potential failures that7\nmay occur in a system, their effects and their likelihood, thus aiding the identification8\nof critical components and processes where design and operational changes are9\nrequired to meet safety and \/ or production targets.151 Analysis may be summarised as10\nfollows:15111\n12\n\uf0b7 system definition \u2013 defining the level of analysis;13\n\uf0b7 failure identification \u2013 identifying potential hazards (e.g. HACCP, hazard and14\noperability studies, FMEA \/ FMECA);15\n\uf0b7 reliability modelling \u2013 to describe failure behaviour of system as a whole16\n(e.g. FTA, ETA, reliability block diagrams); and17\n\uf0b7 sensitivity analysis18\n19\nThe National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), the body20\nresponsible for issuing drinking water guidelines to Australian water utilities, in their21\n\u2018Framework for Management of Drinking Water Quality\u2019131,105 advocated the22\napplication of a HACCP (hazard analysis critical control points) methodology, namely23\nthe determination of \u2018critical control points\u2019 whereupon risks can be monitored and24\nreduced.24 Hellier64 describes the implementation of this approach within Melbourne25\nWater (Australia). The process begins with the division of the water system into four26\n55\ndiscrete subsystems: catchment, treatment, distribution and customer premises.1\nAcross each subsystem (e.g. catchment) the sources of risk to water quality (e.g.2\nnative animals) and the associated hazards (e.g. bacteria, viruses) are identified and3\nplotted on a simple risk matrix; those risks deemed to be significant are evaluated4\nfurther for their critical control points. Assessors then identify the critical limits,5\nmonitoring systems and corrective actions for each CCP. The application of HACCP6\nto South East Water Ltd.\u2019s (Australia) distribution and reticulation systems is7\ndescribed in Mullenger et al.101 Through implementing their HACCP plan, the8\ncompany has developed a greater understanding of water quality issues, refined and9\noptimised operating procedures, and observed a net decrease in customer complaints.10\nThese benefits stem from an increased knowledge and understanding of the water11\nsupply system and an improved ability to identify potential risks to water supply \/12\nquality.101 Beyond managing existing process control, HACCP may also be used to13\nassess and manage the risks from proposed operational changes, such as the14\nintegration of treated domestic wastewater to an existing potable production process15\n(e.g. Dewettinck et al.34).16\nHAZOP (hazard and operability study), a technique developed by Imperial17\nChemical Industries Ltd., systematically evaluates the process and engineering18\nintentions of new or existing facilities in order to identify the hazards that may arise19\ndue to deviations from design specifications.1 Typically, a carefully selected team20\nexamines a process (e.g. disinfection) subdivided into \u2018nodes\u2019, at each node, the team21\napplies guidewords (e.g. low) to process parameters (e.g. ozone levels) to identify22\nways in which the process may deviate from its design intention, before evaluating the23\ncauses and consequences of the deviation. A technical document published by the US24\nDepartment of Energy162 describes the undertaking of a HAZOP study on the partially25\ninstalled chlorination process of a water treatment facility. The analysis, conducted in26\n56\nresponse to regulatory requirements, identified the key areas of uncertainty (e.g.1\nchlorine cylinder received overfilled). \u2018Action items\u2019 and recommendations were2\nformulated to clarify these uncertainties and to verify process conditions (e.g. check3\npressure potential from the chlorine cylinder and the system response).4\nThe practical implementation of many of these techniques is often constrained5\nby the institutional capacity of organisations and the skill sets available at the6\noperational level. Risk analysis remains an expert discipline and many organisations7\nare more comfortable with the historic and proven implicit approach to risk8\nmanagement. Nevertheless, we are witnessing a growing number of utilities making9\ntheir analysis more explicit and using these tools for better decision-making,10\nidentifying risk issues early rather than later, when their ability to respond may be11\ncompromised. At Scottish Water, for example, FMECA-based studies are performed12\nat the operational level. Targeted by a risk criticality scoring system, the analysis13\nsystematically considers various components of the water supply system and their14\nrespective failure modes.82 As the scoring system is \u2018pseudo-economic\u2019, decision-15\nmakers are empowered to assess the costs and benefits in terms of risk reduction per16\npound of mitigation efforts through undertaking simple scenario modelling.82 Where17\nidentified failure modes are traced to specific mechanical or electrical equipment, the18\nequipment is subject to reliability centred maintenance \u2013 the risk-based prioritisation19\nof maintenance activities. In recognition of the dangers of ill-informed risk-based20\nresourcing, select critical-risk assets undergo formal optimisation of maintenance task21\ncost-risk-performance using a suite of asset performance tools (APT).22\nThese methodologies represent an informed and structured, if time-consuming,23\nframework for pinpointing weaknesses in utility design and operation. Applied24\neffectively using personnel with appropriate skills, experience and resources, they25\nprovide operational management with a basis for improving process reliability and26\n57\nidentifying issues early. Ineffectively applied, they become little more than acronyms1\nfor complacency. As discussed, reliability analysis may require a quantitative2\ntreatment of the effect of identified risks at the system level. The importance and3\ncomplexity of this task has increased in recent years, due in part to the increased range4\nof available technologies and the tighter operational margins imposed by regulators.415\nFor unreliable or heavily used equipment, an analysis of historic data may be6\nsufficient for this purpose. In the absence of such data, there is a requirement for the7\nformal modelling of risk consequences. There exist a range of techniques for this8\ntask, including logic modelling (e.g. Demotier et al.;32 Cyna29), \u2018quantitative\u2019 FMECA9\n(e.g. Cyna), and multiple barrier approaches to treatment reliability (e.g. Demotier et10\nal.; Eisenberg et al.41; Haas and Trussell57). An illustration of an integrated approach11\nto evaluating plant reliability is provided by Cyna, who describes the methodology12\ndeveloped and applied by the Compagnie Generale des Eaux (France) (Figure 7).13\nFollowing system definition and modelling (via reliability block diagrams), risks are14\nidentified and classified using HAZOP. Risk consequences are subsequently15\nquantified via FMECA, allowing the computation of system availability (the16\nprobability of the system to be found operative at a given time). Cyna describes how17\nthe methodology was applied to a proposed post-chlorination system in Neuilly-sur-18\nMarne plant, arguing that its employment helped conceive a reliable system and19\nverified the adequacy of plant availability. The author concludes that reliability20\nanalysis is an essential tool at \u2018conception\u2019, which allows the adjustment of project21\ndesign, and thus cost, to the level of reliability required, and, when associated with22\nmaintenance procedures, can provide insurance of design quality.23\n24\n25\n5. CONCLUSION26\n58\n1\nRisk management for water utilities is fast becoming an explicitly-stated2\nparadigm, recognising the implicit approach performed over the last 150 years. With3\nincreasing globalisation, outsourcing and increased regulation of the industry, tools4\nthat allow system vulnerabilities to be identified before failures occur are essential. In5\nmany ways, however, the industry is discovering risk analysis afresh and there is a6\nlearning curve to climb in terms of the capabilities and limitations of these tools and7\ntechniques. The international water sector has helpfully restated its overarching goal8\nreminding us that even in the face of rationalisation and economic pressure, public9\nhealth protection8 is the principal business of the water industry. Risk analysis has a10\npart to play in focussing effort in the right places, but should not be treated as a11\npanacea or substitute for managing risk and neither allowed to dictate the outcome of12\ndecisions without recourse to the fundamental goal of the business. Flexibility of13\napproach is key to the successful application of these tools, as is their appropriate14\nselection within the organisational context and legal framework. For large multi-15\nutilities, one can expect high developed business risk capabilities, whereas for smaller16\nand single utilities, an approach based on accepted codes and standards may be more17\nsuitable. Our analysis provide a comprehensive inventory of the current state-of-the-18\nart as a reference for developing a risk analysis strategy that is fit for purpose.19\n20\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS21\n22\nThis work has been funded by the American Water Works Association Research23\nFoundation (AwwaRF project RFP2939), Yorkshire Water Services, the Canadian24\nWater Network and a consortium of international water utility companies and25\norganisations.
