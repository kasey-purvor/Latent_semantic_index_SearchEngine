INTRODUCTION\nProton and neutron density distributions, the associated\nroot-mean-square (rms) radii Rp and Rn, and the neutron-skin\nthickness \u0002R = Rn \u2212 Rp provide fundamental information\non nuclear structure. For example, halo nuclei are charactered\nwith long tails in density distributions. The density is a\ndirect probe of the size of an atomic nucleus and plays\nan important role in the cross sections of nuclear reactions.\nAlthough charge densities can be measured from the elastic\nscattering of electrons, neutron densities are largely unknown.\nThe parity-violating electron scattering has been suggested to\nmeasure neutron densities [1]. With the experimental method,\nthe neutron densities of more nuclei can be expected to be\nmeasured. Theoretically, the calculated neutron-skin thickness\ncan be model dependent [2].\nRecently, Horowitz et al. [3] studied the relationship\nbetween the neutron skin of the spherical double magic nucleus\n208Pb and the properties of neutron-star crusts, showing\nthe importance of the knowledge of nucleon densities in\nunderstanding the equation of state of neutron-rich matter and\ntherefore the properties of neutron stars. The heavy nucleus\n208Pb has been measured to have a neutron-skin thickness of\nabout 0.15 fm [4]. With increasing mass number, the neutron\nexcess becomes larger in general and it is natural to think\nthat superheavy nuclei provide the largest neutron excesses.\nThe heaviest nuclei also have large proton numbers and thus\nlarge Coulomb repulsive forces that push the protons to larger\nradii and therefore change density distributions. Novel density\ndistributions were predicted in extraordinary A > 400 nuclei\nthat have bubbles and showed coupling effects between density\ndistributions and shell structures [5\u20137]. The nucleon density\nin a bubble is reduced to be zero. Semibubble nuclei were also\nsuggested with the considerable reduction of central densities\nfor the Z\u0001 120 nuclei [6] located around the center of the\npredicted island of stability of superheavy nuclei. Bender et al.\n\u2217Electronic address: frxu c\u00a9pku.edu.cn.\nhave investigated the density distributions of superheavy nuclei\nwith the restriction of spherical shapes [8]. Recent progress in\nexperiments are motivating the structure study of superheavy\nnuclei [9,10]. Many theoretical works have investigated the\nproperties of superheavy nuclei [11\u201320], such as shell struc-\nture, \u03b1 decay, and spontaneous fission. Experiments have also\nprovided the structure information of superheavy nuclei by the\nin-beam study of spectroscopy [21\u201324]. In the present work,\nwe investigate the density distributions of superheavy nuclei\nand related structure properties, with deformation effects taken\ninto account.\nII. CALCULATIONS\nThe deformed Skyrme-Hartree-Fock model (SHF) [25]\nwas used in the present investigation. Pairing correlations are\ntreated in the BCS scheme using a \u03b4-pairing force, Vpair =\n\u2212Vq\u03b4(\u0002r1 \u2212 \u0002r2) [26,27]. The pairing strength Vq (q = p, n for\nthe protons and neutrons, respectively) has been parametrized\nthroughout the chart of nuclei [27], but the actual values are\ndependent on Skyrme forces chosen. The detailed values of\nthe pairing strengths can be found in Ref. [8].\nCalculations are performed in coordinate space with axially\nsymmetric shape. The density distribution of protons or\nneutrons is given in the two-dimensional form as follows:\n\u03c1(z, r) =\n\u2211\nk\n2v2k\n(\u2223\u2223\u03c8+k (z, r)\n\u2223\u22232 + |\u03c8\u2212k (z, r)|2\n)\n, (1)\nwhere, \u03c8+k and \u03c8\n\u2212\nk are the components of the wave functions\nwith intrinsic spin sz = + h\u00af2 and \u2212 h\u00af2 , respectively, and v2k is\nthe pairing occupation probability of the kth orbit. The ground\nstates of most superheavy nuclei are expected to have axially\nsymmetric or spherical shape [13]. In this article, we con-\nsider the most important axially symmetric deformations, \u03b22\nand \u03b24.\nIn the present work, we investigated the densities and\nrelated structure problems of even-even superheavy nuclei\nwith Z = 104\u2013120.

For example, the SkI3 force\npredicts 292120 for the next magic nucleus beyond 208Pb,\nwhereas SLy7 and SkI4 predict 310126 and 298114 for the\nmagic nucleus, respectively [8,11]. To make comparison, we\nused the different sets of parameters SLy4, SLy7 [28], SkI3,\nand SkI4 [29]. These sets of parameters have been developed\nrecently with good isospin properties, and we note that they\nhave been recommended by Rikovska Stone et al. for their\nability to describe realistic neutron stars and the properties\nof asymmetric nuclear matter [30]. In the superheavy mass\nregion, Skyrme parameter sets can reproduce experimental\nbinding energies within a few MeV [31] and \u03b1-decay energies\nwithin a few hundred kiloelectron volts [12]. Table I lists\nthe properties of the ground states calculated with SkI4\nfor experimentally known even-even superheavy nuclei and\nthe predicted magic nucleus 298114. The calculated \u03b1-decay\nenergies agree with experimental data within a few hundred\nkiloelectron volts (the largest difference with data is 640 keV\nin 266Hs). Experimental binding energies can be reproduced\nwithin \u22484 MeV for the nuclei listed in Table I with the\nSkI4 force. The obtained neutron-skin thicknesses are smaller\nthan the calculations by the relativistic mean field (RMF)\n[17]. (It was pointed out that RMF calculations overestimate\nneutron-skin thicknesses [33].)\nA. Density distributions of spherical nuclei\nTo test potential parameters in the calculations of densities,\nwe calculated the density distributions of the spherical doubly\nmagic nucleus 208Pb using the different sets of parameters.\nFor 208Pb, the charge distribution has been measured by\nelectron scattering [34]. Figure 1 shows the calculated density\ndistributions with comparison with the experimental charge\ndensity. It can be seen that the proton density given by the\nSkI4 force is closest to the experimental measurement.

The calculated proton (\u03c1p) and neutron (\u03c1n) density\ndistributions of the spherical nucleus 208Pb compared with the\nexperiment for the charge density [34].\nrms radii of 208Pb are calculated with the SkI4 force to be\n5.43 fm for the protons and 5.61 fm for the neutrons, leading\nto a neutron-skin thickness of 0.18 fm, which is slightly larger\nthan the values of 0.16 fm given by the SLy4 and SLy7 forces.\nThese results agree with the 0.15 \u00b1 0.02 fm from the recent\nantiprotonic atom experiment [4]. The SkI3 force gives a\nlarger neutron-skin thickness of 0.23 fm compared to the other\nthree forces, which may be because of the similar behavior\nof SkI3 force to the RMF model [8]. It needs to be pointed\nout that ground-state correlations (see, e.g., [35,36]) can have\nvisible effects on nuclear properties, such as energies and\ndensities. The oscillations observed in the calculated density\ndistributions in Fig. 1 could be reduced when the correlation\nis taken into account. Such correlations, which go beyond\nthe mean-field approximation, are not included in the present\nwork.\nFigure 2 shows the calculated densities of the spherical\nnucleus 298114. This nucleus was predicted to be the next\ndoubly closed shell nucleus by a Macro-microscopic model\n[13] and SHF with SkI4 force [8]. For 298114, the calculations\nwith SkI4, SLy7, and SLy4 give similar density distributions.\nIt can be seen that the charge density distribution of 298114 has\na central depression. The central density depression has been\npredicted to exist widely in the spherical superheavy nuclei\n[8]. Figure 3 displays the calculated square wave functions\nof the proton 1i13\/2, 1h9\/2, and 2f7\/2 orbits that locate the\n82 < Z\u0002 114 closed shell. It can be seen that the high-j orbits\nhave density contributions in the nuclear surface region. This\nis consistent with the classical picture in which orbits with\nlarge angular momentum locate at the surface. In Fig. 4, we\nshow the proton densities of 208Pb and 298114 for comparison.\nThe proton density of 298114 is decomposed into two parts:\n(i) the contribution from proton orbits below the Z = 82 closed\nshell and (ii) from the orbits in the next closed shell with 82 <\nZ\u0002 114. The contribution from the orbits below Z = 82 has a\nsimilar behavior to the charge distribution of 208Pb, without\n034302-2\nDENSITY DISTRIBUTIONS OF SUPERHEAVY NUCLEI PHYSICAL REVIEW C 71, 034302 (2005)\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nr (fm)\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n\u03c1(\nfm\n-\n3 )\nSkI4\nSly4\nSly7\n\u03c1n\n\u03c1p\nSkI3\nFIG. 2.

The 82 < Z\u0002 114 orbits (that have\nhigh-j values) have contributions in the surface region of the\nnucleus, leading to a central depression in the proton density\nof 298114.\nFor the neutrons at spherical case, the high-j orbits of 2g9\/2,\n1i11\/2, 1j15\/2, and 2g7\/2 appear in the region of N = 126\u2013\n172.

Indeed, these nuclei\nwere predicted to be nearly spherical in their ground states [13].\nIt can be seen that proton densities have central depressions\nand neutron densities become centrally depressed for N \u0002 178.\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nr (fm)\n0.002\n0.004\n0.006\n0.008\n0.01\n\uf8e6\u03c8\nk\uf8e62\n(fm\n-\n3 )\n2f7\/2\n1h9\/2\n1i13\/2\nFIG. 3.

Densities of deformed superheavy nuclei\nThe shell fillings of nucleons are sensitive to the defor-\nmations of nuclei. Therefore, density distributions should be\nexpected to be shape dependent.

The deformations determined with the\nSkI4 force are \u03b22 = 0.25, 0.19, and 0.05 for 270,280,290110,\nrespectively.

For comparison, distributions at assumed spherical shape are also displayed\nin the right column.\nshown in Fig. 6. The deformations determined with SLy7 are\n\u03b22 = 0.25, 0.17, and 0.05 for 270,280,290110, respectively. To\nsee deformation effects, we calculated the densities assuming\nspherical shape. It can be seen for 270,280110 that the densities\nbecome more centrally depressed in spherical cases. We also\nsee some difference between the densities along the z and\nr axes. Figure 7 shows the two-dimensional proton density\ndistribution for the 280110 nucleus. The density has two humps\nin the z axis. The double-hump distribution has been suggested\nexperimentally, for example, in the deformed 166Er and 176Yb\n[37]. Our calculations with SkI4 and SLy7 show that such a\ndouble-hump phenomenon is relatively pronounced for nuclei\naround 280110. The macro-microscopic calculations show that\nthe even-even nuclei around N = 170 are particularly unstable\nagainst spontaneous fission (see Fig. 9 in [13]). This could be\nrelated to the double-hump distributions in these deformed\nnuclei.\nFigure 8 shows the distributions of the square wave func-\ntions of the jz = 1\/2 orbits in 280110, modified with pairing\noccupation probabilities [see Eq. (1)]. These orbits are above\nthe Z = 82 and N = 126 shells for the protons and neutrons,\nrespectively. Shown as in Fig. 8, the high-j, low-jz orbits have\nimportant contributions to densities in the surface region of the\nz axis. High-j, low-jz orbits have strong prolate-driving effect.\nHence, sufficient number of high-j, low-jz orbits occupied\ncan result in prolate shapes and double-hump densities. In\n166Er and 176Yb that were suggested experimentally to have\ndouble-hump densities, the low-jz orbits of the proton 1h11\/2,\n1g7\/2 subshells are occupied.\nDensity distributions given by different Skyrme forces\ncan differ, as shown in Fig. 6. The SLy7 predicts a larger\ncentral depression in neutron densities and a less central\ndepression in proton densities than the SkI4 force.

The SkI4-calculated contributions (in the z axis) of the\njz = 1\/2 orbits in the 280110 case, with the modifications of pairing\noccupation probabilities. The dashed line represents the summed\ncontributions of the orbits.\ndifference also occurs in the calculation of 208Pb (see Fig. 1).\nFor different parameters, the opposite behavior of proton\nand neutron distributions reduces the difference in the total\n(proton+neutron) nuclear density distributions. The origin of\nthe opposite behavior would be because of the self-consistent\ncoupling between protons and neutrons in the SHF model to\napproach the nuclear density saturation [38]. The SkI4 force\nis better in reproducing the density of 208Pb compared to other\nSkyrme forces used in the present investigation. However, the\nSkI4 force was shown to have larger spin-orbit splittings in the\ncalculations of single-particle level schemes for the superheavy\nregion [8].\nC. The 292120 nucleus\n292120 is an interesting nucleus that was predicted to be a\ndoubly magic [8] and spherical semibubble nucleus [6]. We\ncalculated the energy curve with the SLy4, SLy7, SkI3, and\nSkI4 parameters; see Fig. 9. The results of SLy4, SLy7, and\nSkI4 are close to the Hartree-Fock calculations with Gogny\nforce [6]. The SkI3 force gives a shallow spherical minimum.\nThe SkI4 calculation predicts three minima at \u03b22 = 0.11,\n\u22120.12, and 0.52 (superdeformations in superheavy nuclei have\n0.4 0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\u03b22\n\u22124\n\u22122\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\nEn\ner\ngy\n (M\neV\n)\nSkI3\nSkI4\nSly4\nSly7\nFIG. 9. Calculated energy curves of 292120 with different Skyrme\nforces as a function of quadrupole deformation.\nbeen discussed by Ren et al. [16,17]). It needs to be mentioned\nthat the present calculations are restricted to axially symmetric\nshapes without considering the possibility of triaxiality. The\ninclusion of the triaxial degree of freedom could alter the\nshallow minima. Figure 10 shows the SkI4 calculated density\ndistributions at the prolate and oblate shapes. For comparison,\nthe densities at the spherical shape are also displayed. It\ncan be seen that significant central depressions or central\nsemibubble appear in the spherical case. However, the situation\nis considerably altered even with a small shape change. Only\nweak central depressions are seen at the small deformations\n(see Fig. 10). To have a further understanding, we calculated\nthe corresponding single-particle potentials in the z axis,\nshown inside Fig. 10. It can be seen that the proton potential\nhas a considerable change with changing the deformation.\nThe spherical proton potential has a significant hump at\nthe center of the nucleus. This implies that the Coulomb\nenergy can be considerably reduced by forming the center\nsemibubble at the spherical shape. The Coulomb energy can\nalso be reduced by generating the deformation of the nucleus.\nIn the reduction of the total energy of the nucleus, there\nis competition between forming the central semibubble and\ngenerating the deformation. The deformation can affect the\nshell structure and then density distributions, and vice versa.\nIn a self-consistent model, such as the SHF approach, densities\nare fed back into the potential, which amplifies the coupling\nbetween deformations and densities.\nIII. SUMMARY\nIn summary, the density distributions of superheavy nuclei\nhave been investigated with the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock model.\nTo test the model and parameters, the \u03b1-decay energies\nof even-even superheavy nuclei and the charge density of\n208Pb are calculated and compared to existing experimental\ndata. For axially symmetrically deformed nuclei, the density\ndistributions in the symmetric z and the vertical r axes or the\n034302-5\nJ. C. PEI, F. R. XU, AND P. D.

The inset figures show the single-particle potentials in the z axis.\ntwo-dimension distributions were calculated. The distribution\nin different directions can be different. The high-j, low-jz\norbits have important contributions to the densities at nuclear\nsurface in the z axis, whereas high-j, high-jz orbits have\nimportant contributions at surfaces in the r axis. The defor-\nmation effect was found to be significant in the calculation\nof the density distribution in the 292120 nucleus. Only a\nweak central depression was seen in the deformed case for\n292120 compared to the predicted semibubble at the spherical\nshape.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Professor P. M.
