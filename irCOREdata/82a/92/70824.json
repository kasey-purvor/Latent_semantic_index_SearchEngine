Fluctuational transitions between two coexisting attractors are investigated. Two differ-\nent systems are considered: the periodically driven nonlinear oscillator and the two-dimensional\nmap introduced by Holmes. These two systems have smooth and fractal boundaries, respectively,\nseparating their coexisting attractors. It is shown that, starting from a cycle embedded in the chaotic\nattractor, the periodically-driven oscillator escapes to a saddle cycle at the boundary of the basin\nof attraction, and does so through sequential transitions between saddles cycles embedded in the\nattractor. In the case of discrete dynamics with locally disconnected fractal boundaries, it is shown\nthat escape from an attractor always seems to occur through an accessible boundary orbit and fur-\nther through the specific homoclinic points forming a fractal structure of the boundary. It is shown\nthat analysis of fluctuational transitions between attractors can be used to solve a problem of the\nenergy-optimal migration of a chaotic system. The deterministic optimal control functions are iden-\ntified with the corresponding optimal fluctuational forces in the limit of small noise intensity. We\ndiscuss possible applications and related unsolved problems of stochastic dynamics.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe way in which fluctuational escape occurs from a chaotic attractor (CA) subject to\nnoise has been a major unsolved problem ever since the first attempt to generalize the\nclassical escape problem to cover this case [1]. We have recently used measurements of\nthe prehistory probability distribution to analyse [2] escape from a chaotic attractor to\na coexisting stable limit cycle in a periodically driven nonlinear oscillator \u2013 a situation\nwhere the basin boundaries are smooth. In the present work, we summarise these results,\nset them in context, and describe a completely new study in which we have extended the\ninvestigation to treat the discrete dynamics of a 2-dimensional map [3] for which the\nbasin boundaries are fractal.\nAs in our earlier study [2], we bring together two seemingly quite different unsolved\nproblems: first, that of fluctuational escape from a chaotic attractor and, secondly, the\nenergy-optimal stimulation of escape in the absence of noise. We show that, remarkably,\na solution of the first problem leads naturally to a solution of the second one.\nThe methods already available [4] for the control of chaos include entraining to a\nchosen \u201cgoal dynamics\u201d that necessarily requires large modifications of the system\u2019s\ndynamics, and a variety of minimal forms of interaction which have hitherto been\nrestricted by the linear approximations adopted. Solution of the energy-optimal control\nproblem constitutes an important extension of the range of model-exploration objectives\nachievable through minimal control techniques.\nThe main difficulty in tackling these problems stems from the complexity of the\nsystem dynamics near a CA and in general near boundaries, which may be fractal. The\nproblems are related, in particular, to delicate questions concerning the uniqueness of\nthe solution and the boundary conditions at a CA with fractal basin boundaries. The\napproach that we apply is based on the analysis of an oscillator interacting with a\nthermal bath. In the zero-noise-intensity limit, a consistent theoretical development [5, 6]\nfrom the microscopic to the macroscopic equations of motion leads to descriptions of\nboth its deterministic (dissipative) and fluctuational dynamics within the framework of\nHamiltonian formalism [7]. It can be shown on physical grounds, and rigorously, that the\nWentzel-Freidlin Hamiltonian [7] arising in this approach is equivalent to the Pontryagin\nHamiltonian in the control problem [8] with an additive linear unrestricted control; the\ncorresponding optimal control function is equivalent to the optimal fluctuational force.\nThe solution of the energy-optimal control problem can thus be found to an excellent\napproximation by building the prehistory probability distribution [9] of fluctuational\nescape trajectories.\nWe illustrate the approach by analysing and comparing two very different cases:\nescape from the chaotic attractor of a periodically driven nonlinear oscillator where the\nbasin boundaries are smooth [2]; and escape from the chaotic attractor of an invertible\n2-dimensional map with fractal basin boundaries [3].\nCONTINUOUS-TIME DYNAMICS\nWe consider a periodically driven nonlinear oscillator of form\nq\u02d91 = q2, (1)\nq\u02d92 = \u22122\u0393q2\u2212\u03c920 q1\u2212\u03b2q21\u2212 \u03b3q31\u2212hcos(\u2126t)+\u03be (t),\n\u3008\u03be (t)\u3009= 0, \u3008\u03be (t)\u03be (0)\u3009= D\u03b4 (t).\nHere \u03be (t) is the Gaussian white noise. Parameters were chosen such that the potential is\nmonostable (\u03b2 2 < 4\u03b3\u03c920 ), the dependence of the energy of oscillations on their frequency\nis nonmonotonic (\u03b2 2\/\u03b3\u03c920 > 9\/10), and the motion is underdamped \u0393 \u0004 \u2126 \u2248 2\u03c90.\nThis model is of interest in number of applications and allows a theoretical analysis to\nbe carried out over a wide range of parameters values. It is a system in which chaos\ncan conveniently be observed at relatively small values h \u2248 0.1 of the driving force\namplitude.\nFor the given parameters \u03c90 \u2248 0.597, \u03b2 = 1, \u03b3 = 1 and, with damping constant\n\u0393 = 0.025, the amplitude and frequency of the driving force were chosen such that the\nchaotic attractor coexists with the stable limit cycle. The chaotic state appears as the\nresult of period-doubling bifurcations and thus corresponds to a nonhyperbolic attractor\n(NHA). The boundary of attraction \u2202\u2126 of the NHA is non-fractal and is formed by the\nstable manifold of the saddle cycle of period 1.\nDirect application of Hamiltonian formalism [7] consists of consideration of a bound-\nary problem and requires the identification of the generally unknown boundary condi-\ntions on the CA and on the boundaries of attraction (for fractal boundaries) and relies\n0 5 10 15\n\u22121\n0\n1\n2\n3\n\u03c9ft\/2\u03c0\n\u2329 q1\nesc\u232a\n\u2329 \u03beesc\u232a\n0\n\u22120.05\nFIGURE 1. The most probable escape path (bottom, full curve) from the NHA to the boundary saddle\ncycle of period 1, found in numerical simulations with \u0393 = 0.025, h = 0.13, \u2126 = 0.95, D \u2248 0.01. Single\nperiods of the unstable saddle cycles of period 5, 3 and 1 are shown by open circles, squares and triangles\nrespectively; the stable limit cycle is shown by rhombus.

The optimal path and the optimal fluctuational force found by solution of the boundary value\nproblem for motion equations with Wentzel-Freidlin Hamiltonian, corresponding to the system 1, are\nshown as dotted lines. After [2].\non the existence of the so-called most probable escape (optimal) path and correspond-\ning optimal fluctuational force, which coincides with the optimal control function in the\ncontrol problem. The use of the experimental prehistory technique [9] can solve all these\nproblems and gives accurate approximation for the optimal control force.\nThe idea underlying our experimental technique is that, when the system (1) is driven\nby a random force \u03be (t) it will occasionally fluctuate to \u2202\u2126. In doing so in the limit\nwhere the noise intensity tends to zero, the system will follow very closely the optimal\nescape path.\nThe method involves following the dynamics of the system continuously and collect-\ning all successful realizations (qesc1 (t),qesc2 (t),\u03be esc(t)) that move it from the NHA to \u2202\u2126.\nAn approximate control function is then found as an ensemble average over the corre-\nsponding realizations of the random force \u3008\u03be esc(t)\u3009. The boundary conditions are found\nfrom an analysis of how the energy-optimal escape path (\u3008qesc1 (t)\u3009,\u3008qesc2 (t)\u3009) merges with\nthe NHA.\nA typical optimal escape path and the corresponding optimal force, obtained [2] by\naveraging a few hundred escape trajectories, are shown in Fig. 1. Analysis of the optimal\npath reveals that the system leaves the NHA along the unstable manifold of the saddle\nlimit cycle of period 5 (with multipliers \u00b51 = 0.04157 < 1 and \u00b52 = 4.60403728 > 1)\nembedded in the NHA. At this moment the optimal fluctuational force \u3008\u03be esc(t)\u3009 switches\non, driving the system to \u2202\u2126 via the saddle cycle of period 3 (with multipliers \u00b51 =\n0.04873 < 1 and \u00b52 = 7.608312 > 1).

Note that no action is required to bring\nthe system from S1 to the stable limit cycle.\nNote that the saddle cycle of period 3 is not embedded in the NHA. It is probably the\nnearest saddle cycle to the boundary of the basin of attraction of the NHA in terms of\nthe action variable, and can be considered as the boundary of the NHA itself.\nDISCRETE-TIME DYNAMICS\nAs a second and very different example we consider fluctuational transitions between\nchaotic attractors separated by a fractal basin boundary in the two-dimensional map\nintroduced my Holmes [3]:\nxi+1 = yi, (2)\nyi+1 =\u2212bxi +ayi\u2212 y3i +\u03bei,\nwhere \u03bei is white Gaussian noise with \u3008\u03bei\u3009 = 0 and \u3008\u03bei, \u03be j\u3009 = 2D\u03b4i j. We choose (2)\nfor our investigation because it exhibits a generic type of locally disconnected fractal\nbasin boundary (see [10]), and because it reproduces most of the important features\nin the chaotic dynamics of the periodically driven Duffing oscillator [3]. The use of a\ndiscrete model brings the additional advantage of allowing us to speed up our numerical\ncalculation for the case of low noise intensity.\nWe choose values of the control parameters a and b in (2) such that, in the purely\ndeterministic case (D = 0), there are two co-existing chaotic attractors in phase space\nseparated by a locally disconnected fractal basin boundary (see Fig. 2(a)). The fractal\ndimension of the boundary has been determined numerically as d = 1.8441 by using the\n43\n4\n43\n4\n3\nO\nx\nn\nn\ny\nFIGURE 3. The escape trajectory in (2) from one chaotic attractor (full lines) to the other passes through\nthe period-3 (full lines) and period-4 (dashed lines) original saddle cycles. The values of the control\nparameters and noise intensity are the same as in Fig. 1.\nnumerical \u201cuncertainty exponent\u201d technique introduced in [12]. We excite our system\n(2) with weak noise and collect trajectories that include escape paths from one chaotic\nattractor to the other (see Fig. 2(b)). The noise intensity was chosen in such a way that the\nmean escape time was essentially large; the characteristic relaxation time of an invariant\nmeasure on the corresponding chaotic set was estimated by us as 3\u00d7 107 iterations.\nAs can be clearly seen in Fig. 2(b), all escape trajectories have a part corresponding to\nthe period-3 saddle cycle, apparently implying the presence of a boundary point located\nnear, or directly on, the fractal boundary. Simple calculations have shown that the period-\n3 saddle cycle does exist for the chosen parameter values and that it lies on the boundary.\nMoreover, its stable manifold (full line in Fig. 2(a)), lying in the boundary, detaches the\nopen neighborhood including the chaotic attractor from the fractal basin boundary itself.\nOne part of its unstable manifold belongs to the homoclinic structure forming the fractal\nboundary, whereas the other part (labeled by the dashed line in Fig. 2(a)) approaches\nthe attractor. Thus, we can classify this period-3 saddle as an accessible boundary point\n[13]. Indeed, by the definition given in [13] a boundary point P is accessible from a\ngiven region if there is a curve of finite length connecting P to an attractor in the interior\nof the region, such that no point of the curve lies in the boundary except for P. In our\ncase, the part of the unstable manifold approaching the chaotic attractor plays the role\nof such a curve. Thus, in the present case, the period-3 saddle point plays the role of the\nboundary condition.\nIt is well known that the global behavior of a chaotic dynamical system is in many\nrespects determined by a homoclinic structure, i.e. by a set consisting of homoclinic\nsaddle cycles resulting from tangencies of the stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle\n34\n5\n6\nFIGURE 4. Heteroclinic crossings of the stable and unstable manifolds of different original saddles.\npoint. In our case, we observe an infinite sequence of saddle-node bifurcations of period\n3,4,5,6,7..., which occur at parameter values d3 < d4 < d5 < d6 < d7... and are caused\nby the sequential tangencies of the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point O at\n(0, 0). The homoclinic orbits appearing as the result of these bifurcations were classified\nearlier as original saddles [13]. It was also shown that their stable and unstable manifolds\ncross each other in a hierarchical sequence: the unstable manifold of the period-3 saddle\ncrosses the stable manifold of the period-4 saddle, the unstable manifold of the period-4\nsaddle crosses the stable manifold of the period-5 saddle, etc. (see Fig. 4). Our numerical\ncalculations have shown that these original saddles play a key role in the escape through\na fractal basin boundary and that their hierarchy defines the structure of the escape paths.\nFig. 3 shows a typical escape path obtained in numerical simulations. As clearly seen\nfrom this figure, a phase trajectory leaving the chaotic attractor penetrates into the fractal\nbasin boundary through a small neighborhood of the period-3 saddle cycle, makes a\nfew turns, and then approaches another period-4 original saddle point. After that it\nmoves to the basin of the other chaotic attractor, reaching it in the next two or three\niterations. In fact, the heteroclinic structure formed by numerous sequential crossings of\nthe stable and unstable manifolds of original homoclinic saddles plays the role of the\n\u201cstaircase\u201d allowing a trajectory to pass over the fractal basin boundary and defining\nthe structure of the escape paths. Moreover, a hierarchical relation between original\nsaddles can be revealed if we characterize them by a parameter \u00b5 equal to the ratio\n| \u03bbs (P) | \/\u03bbu (P) of the stable and unstable eigenvalues of the linearized deterministic\nflow at a saddle point P. Simple calculations show that, for the original saddles with\nperiods 3,4,5,6,7,8... in (2), the following hierarchical sequence of index \u00b5 values\noccurs: \u00b53 = 3.339, \u00b54 = 3.08, \u00b55 = 2.999, \u00b56 = 2.339, \u00b57 = 1.958, \u00b58 = 1.539. The\nestimates of probabilities to find a fragment of the corresponding original saddle cycles\nin the escape trajectories are in a very good agreement with the hierarchical relation\nobtained above. By using the procedure described above for the continuous system, we\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nn\n-1,5\n-1\n-0,5\n0\n0,5\nFIGURE 5. The optimal fluctuational force calculated at a = 2.7,b = 0.2 and D = 1.25 \u00b710\u22125.\nwere able to calculate the optimal fluctuational force migrating the phase trajectory from\none attractor to the other (see Fig. 5).\nThus we conclude that the control function and the corresponding boundary condi-\ntions can be found using the same technique [2] for both continuous and discrete time\nchaotic dynamics, and with both smooth and fractal basin boundaries around the chaotic\nattractor. Moreover the escape problem has in this case been reduced to the analysis of\ntransitions between saddle cycles, in qualitative agreement with the well known state-\nment that unstable cycles provide detailed invariant characterizations for dynamical sys-\ntems of low intrinsic dimension.\nThe probability of escape from a chaotic attractor can now be calculated, therefore,\nas a product of the probabilities of transitions between saddle cycles. To date, the\ntheoretical procedure for calculation of these probabilities remains an unsolved problem.\nIt requires calculation of the invariant measure of the saddle cycles in the presence\nof noise, and the development of methods for calculation of the transition probability\nbetween cycles as a function of noise intensity. Although it is a difficult problem, the\npresent work has brought a solution closer and will be applicable in many areas of\nphysics, including e.g. the stability problem for ac-biased Josephson [1] junctions and\nthe problem of fluctuational transitions in lasers [11].\nREFERENCES\n1.
