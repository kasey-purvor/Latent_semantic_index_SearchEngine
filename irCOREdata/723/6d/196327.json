Introduction \n \nUnder normal physiological conditions, blood flow to the brain is controlled by \nmultiple mechanisms, including cerebral pressure-autoregulation (CA), which \nmaintains cerebral blood flow (CBF) relatively constant for changes in arterial blood \npressure (BP) in the range 60-150 mmHg (Paulson et al 1990). Early studies of CA \nadopted a \u201estatic\u201f approach, using mean values of BP and CBF averaged over several \nminutes. With the advent of transcranial Doppler ultrasound, it became possible to \nrecord CBF velocity (CBFV) with very high temporal resolution and this allowed the \nidentification of transient responses of CBFV to sudden changes in BP, giving rise to \nthe concept of \u201edynamic\u201f CA (Aaslid et al 1989). \n \nDynamic CA has several advantages when compared to the static approach, mainly \nthat it does not require the induction of long lasting changes in mean BP, usually \nachieved with the use of pharmacological agents (Panerai 1998). Although dynamic \nCA cannot be observed without changes in mean BP, relatively fast changes can be \ninduced by several different manoeuvres such as the thigh cuff test (Aaslid et al \n1989), Valsalva manoeuvre (Tiecks et al 1996), cold pressor test (Panerai et al 2001), \nsynchronized breathing (Diehl et al 1995) or repeated squatting (Birch et al 1995). Of \nconsiderable interest is the possibility of using spontaneous fluctuations in BP and \nCBFV to model dynamic CA since this avoids any physiological perturbation and \ndoes not require any collaboration from the subject (Panerai 1998). \n \nDespite our recent ability to record changes in CBFV with high temporal resolution, \nmost approaches proposed to study dynamic CA have adopted a relatively low \ntemporal resolution for the estimation of CA parameters. For estimates derived from \nspontaneous fluctuations in BP and CBFV, recordings usually last between 5-10 min. \nleading to a single set of CA parameters.  One set of estimates is obtained from each \nmanoeuvre performed to induce changes in BP, but each manoeuvre can take several \nminutes to perform (Czosnyka et al 1997, Panerai et al 1998, Panerai 1998, Tiecks et \nal 1995, Zhang et al 1998). There are two main reasons why it would be important to \nincrease the temporal resolution of estimates of dynamic CA. Firstly, as with most \nphysiological processes, it is unlikely that CA is a rigidly constant mechanism, but \n 3 \n \nwould rather show some intrinsic variability which can be modulated by other \nbiological factors (Busija and Heistad 1984, Gotoh et al 1982, Jones et al 1995, Vern \net al 1988). Secondly, because CA involves vasoactive responses and hence changes \nin cerebrovascular resistance, which physically relates CBFV to BP, it cannot be \nregarded as a time-invariant system and will inevitably show some degree of non-\nstationarity. This is more likely to be manifested during physiological manoeuvres \nsuch as head-up tilt, exercise, Valsalva or lower-body negative pressure. \n \nPrevious studies of the variability or non-stationarity of dynamic CA involved \nanalysis of spontaneous transients of BP (Panerai et al 2003a) or the use of a sliding-\nwindow autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) approach (Panerai et al 2003b). \nEvidence of daily changes in the efficiency of CA in severe head injury patients was \nobtained with a sliding correlation index (Czosnyka et al 1997). Neural networks \n(Mitsis et al 2004), wavelet analysis (Latka et al 2005) and multimodal \ndecomposition (Novak et al 2004) have also been proposed as techniques to cope with \nthe non-stationarity of dynamic CA. \n \nIn a previous study, it was suggested that continuous non-invasive measurements of \nfinger BP made with the Finapres (or Portapres) device might exacerbate the \nvariability of dynamic CA parameters estimated during spontaneous fluctuations in \nBP and CBFV (Panerai et al 2003b). To test this hypothesis, continuous estimates of \nan index of dynamic CA (ARI)  (Tiecks et al 1995) were obtained in patients \nundergoing coronary angioplasty, in whom BP was simultaneously recorded \ninvasively (aorta) and non-invasively (finger). Surrogate data, generated by computer \nsimulation, were used to validate the signal processing algorithms adopted to extract \ntime-varying estimates of ARI. \n  \n2. Methods \n \n2.1 Subjects and measurements \nRecruited subjects were scheduled for routine elective percutaneous coronary \ninterventions. Patients were excluded if they had any condition that could distort \nFinapres measurements of BP such as arthritis or Raynaud\u201fs disease. All patients were \nin a stable condition without evidence of significant valve disease. Ethical approval \n 4 \n \nwas obtained from the Leicestershire Ethics Committee and written informed consent \nwas obtained before each study. \n \nPatients were asked to fast for at least 6 hours before the procedure and also to avoid \nalcohol and nicotine. All studies were conducted in the morning in a temperature \ncontrolled recovery room, immediately following percutaneous coronary angiography \nor angioplasty. After the elective procedure, the angiographic catheter was replaced \nby a catheter-tip pressure transducer (Mikro-Tip SPC-454E, Millar Instruments, \nHouston, Texas), after it was zero-balanced. The Millar catheter was advanced in the \nascending aorta with its final position 2-3 cm before the aortic valve checked by \nfluoroscopy. Cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was \nrecorded bilaterally by Doppler ultrasound (2MHz, Scimed QVL842X, Bristol, UK) \nwith probes placed over the temporal bone and secured with an adjustable head frame. \nThe surface ECG was recorded with three standard chest leads and transcutaneous \nCO2 (TINA, Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark) was monitored continuously with \nan axillary probe overlying the Tail of Spence.The Finapres cuff (Finapres 2300, \nOhmeda, Englewood, Colorado) of the appropriate size was placed around the middle \nor annular finger of the hand that was not cannulated and the hand was kept at atrial \nlevel. In most patients the hand was covered with a blanket to prevent it from getting \ncold. The Finapres cuff was repositioned until a stable waveform was achieved with \nthe servo-adjust on, waveforms being considered stable when the period between \nservo-adjusts was >30 beats duration (Hope et al 2004). After all measurements were \nstable for 15 min., Finapres and Millar transducer calibration signals were recorded, \nfollowed by continuous data recording on digital audiotape (Sony PC 208AX, Tokyo, \nJapan) for two ten minute periods. A second calibration of the Finapres and Millar \ntransducer was performed before the second recording. To avoid interruption of the \nrecorded signals, the self-adjusting servo of the Finapres was switched off at the \nbeginning of each recording. \n    \n \n2.2 Data analysis  \nData were downloaded in real time onto a dedicated personal computer. An FFT was \nused to convert the Doppler signals into maximum frequency velocity envelopes with \na 5 ms window resolution. The two BP signals, ECG and transcutaneous CO2 were \n 5 \n \nsampled at 200 samples\/s per channel. The data were visually inspected to select \nrecordings that had good quality waveforms for both CBFV channels, as well as BP \nfrom the Finapres (BPFIN) and aorta (BPAO) uninterrupted for at least 7 min. In \npatients who had two good quality recordings, only the longest recording was used for \nanalysis. The CBFV signal was filtered with a 5-point median filter and all signals \nwere low-pass filtered with a zero-phase eighth-order Butterworth digital filter with a \ncut-off frequency of 20 Hz. Each cardiac cycle was automatically marked to \ndetermine the R-R interval from the ECG tracing. Heart rate was calculated from the \nR-R interval. For all available cardiac cycles in each recording, spline interpolation \nwas used to resample the data with a time interval 0.2 s to create a uniform time base. \n \nThe autoregulation index (ARI) proposed by Tiecks et al (1995) was used to simulate \nand also to identify the temporal variability of CA. The Finapres or intra-aortic mean \nBP signal, represented generically by P(t), was normalized:  \n \nCrCPP\nPtP\ntdP\nM\nM)()(         (1) \n \nwhere PM is the mean value of P(t) for the data window. CrCP is the critical closing \npressure, and was chosen as 12 mmHg (Tiecks et al 1995). The model predicted \nvelocity, VT(t) is given by \n \n)()(1)( 2 txKtdPVtV MT        (2) \n \nwhere K is a parameter reflecting autoregulatory gain and VM is the mean velocity for \nthe entire record.  x1(t) and x2(t) are intermediate variables given by: \n \nTf\ntxtdP\ntxtx\n)1()(\n)1()( 211        (3) \n \nTf\ntxDtx\ntxtx\n)1(..2)(\n)1()( 2122       (4) \n \n 6 \n \nf, D, and T represent the sampling frequency, damping factor, and time constant \nparameters, respectively. Specific combinations of values of K, D, and T were used to \ngenerate 10 grades of dynamic autoregulation, expressed by the ARI, ranging from 0 \n(absence of autoregulation) to 9 (best autoregulation) (Tiecks et al 1995). \n \nTieck\u00b4s model was initially proposed to represent the CBFV response to a negative \nstep change in BP, but it has been shown that it can also fit the CBFV-BP dynamic \nrelationship during spontaneous fluctuations in BP or other challenges such as the \nValsalva manoeuvre or lower body negative pressure (Panerai et al 2001). To \nsimulate CBFV signals with constant values of ARI, P(t) is taken as the input variable \nand the values of K, D, T, corresponding to the selected value of ARI, were used with \nequations (2-4) to generate the velocity signal. To simulate velocity signals with time-\nvarying CA, the ARI was increased stepwisely from 0 to 9, in steps to 3, each step \nlasting 120 s (Fig. 3). Finally, the simulated velocity signal VS(t) was given by: \n \n)()()( ttVtV TS                  (5) \n \nwhere VT(t) is given by equation (2) and  \u03b7(t) is band-filtered random noise obtained \nby low-pass filtering gaussian white noise with a cutoff frequency of 0.3 Hz. \n \nGiven a pair of pressure and velocity signals, an ARMA model (Ljung and \nSoderstrom 1983) was used to calculate the velocity impulse and step responses as the \nfirst step to the estimation of the ARI index. In a previous study, the ARMA model \nwas found to provide more reliable values of ARI than direct fitting ot Eqs. 1-4 to \ntime-series of V(t) and P(t) (Panerai et al 2003b). This approach was used with both \nmeasured and simulated velocity signals, and for both BPFIN and BPAO. \n \nThe general structure of these models is \n \n1\n01\n)()()(\nQ\nj\nj\nM\ni\ni jtPbitVatV        (6) \n \n 7 \n \nwhere the ai and bj are real coefficients and [M,Q] are the model orders (Ljung and \nSoderstrom 1983). For each data segment, the model coefficients were estimated by \nthe least-square method. Previous studies have indicated that a [2,3] model was the \nmost suitable for modeling dynamic CA (Liu et al 2003, Panerai et al 2003b). \n \nAfter obtaining the best fit for a data window of duration NW, the impulse and step \nresponses were calculated from ai and bj, and the velocity step response generated by \nthe ARMA model was matched to the most appropriate of the 10 step responses given \nby Tieck's model, using the correlation coefficient, but taking into account only the \nfirst Nfit = 12 s of the step response. The implications of this choice will be discussed \nlater. Once a best-fit curve was selected, a parabolic interpolation was performed to \nestimate the value of ARI to one decimal place. To obtain time-varying, continuous \nvalues of ARI, a NW = 60 s sliding window was used and sequential estimates were \nobtained at 0.6 s intervals. Due to the duration of the window, estimates of ARI could \nnot be obtained for the first and last 30 s of each record. The corresponding time \nseries was represented by ARI(t). \n \nThree separate studies were performed: i) Simulation of constant values of ARI, ii) \nsimulation of step changes in ARI(t), as a staircase varying from 0 to 9 in steps of 3, \nand iii) estimation of ARI(t) from real data to characterize its variability and the \ninfluence of the BP source, that is BPFIN and BPAO. In simulation studies, the velocity \nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNRV) was expressed in decibels, that is \n \n2\n10 2\n10log VV\nN\nSNR         (7) \n \nwhere \u03c3V\n2\n and \u03c3N\n2\n are the velocity and noise variances, respectively. BPAO was used to \ngenerate VT(t) signals and corresponding values of ARI(t) were extracted using both \nBPFIN and BPAO after noise was added to VT(t) (eq. 5). Only one simulated VT(t) signal \nwas generated for each subject for each value of ARI. The appropriate SNRV (eq. 7) \nwas found by comparing the coherence function between BPAO and VS(t) with values \nof coherence between CBFV and invasive aortic BP previously found with measured \ndata. At the frequency of 0.1 Hz this representative value of the squared coherence \n 8 \n \nwas chosen as  \u03b32=0.65 (Sammons et al 2007). For simulations and estimates derived \nfrom patient data, the continuous ARI(t) was averaged for each subject ( ( )ARI t ) and \nthe population mean \u00b1 SD was calculated, as well as the intra-subject variability, \nrepresented by the standard deviation of ARI(t) for each recording. With patient data, \n( )ARI t  was also compared to single estimates of ARI (ARISINGLE) obtained with the \nARMA model using the entire data record. \n \n \n2.3 Statistics  \nAll comparisons used exactly the same number of cardiac cycles extracted from the \nFinapres and intra-aortic measurements.  Differences between estimates of ARI were \ntested with Student\u201fs paired t-test. Differences between intra-subject variabilities were \ntested with the F-test for the ratio of two variances. Differences between probability \ndistributions were tested with the \u03c72 test. Pearson correlation coefficients were also \ncalculated and tested with the log transformation followed by the Z-test. Linear \nregressions between intra-subject coefficients of variation (CoV) of ARI(t) and CoV \nBP were performed to test for the influence of BP variability on the dispersion of \nARI(t) values. A value of p<0.05 was considered significant. \n \n \n3. Results \n \nA total of 45 patients were recruited, but good quality Doppler recordings for both \nMCAs were only obtained in 27 subjects. The main reason for rejection was the \nabsence of a suitable acoustic window in one or both sides. Table 1 gives the \ndemographic and baseline characteristics of the population studied.  \n \n3.1 Simulation study  \nIn simulations with fixed values of ARI, reducing the SNRV led to increases in ARIAO \nbias and also in intra-record variability as expressed by the CoV in Fig. 1. These \nchanges were highly dependent on the value of ARI selected. The highest bias and \nCoV were observed for ARI = 0 and the smallest for ARI = 9 (Fig. 1). For ARI = 5, \nthe bias remained relatively stable between 0 and 10 dB and the CV tended to show \nan asymptotic behaviour for higher values of SNRV (Fig. 1). The population \n 9 \n \ncumulative probability distributions for the continuous estimates of ARI for these \nfixed-value simulations are given in Fig. 5A. \n \nFor ARI=5, the coherence criterion of \u03b32 (0.1Hz) = 0.65 was met for simulations with \nSNRV=3 dB. The corresponding mean \u00b1 SD values of coherence for simulations with \nSNRV = 0 dB and 10 dB were \u03b3\n2\n = 0.56 \u00b1 0.15 and 0.88 \u00b1 0.09, respectively. Figure 2 \nshows mean \u00b1 SD of ( )ARI t  and intra-subject variability for simulations with fixed \nvalues of ARI for SNRV=3 dB. In general, ARIFIN was above and ARIAO was below \nthe reference value of ARI. Mean values of ARIFIN were significantly greater than \ncorresponding values derived from aortic pressure for reference ARI \u2264 8 (p<0.05). \nThe bias increased as the reference value of ARI was reduced. The intra-subject \nvariability was significantly greater for ARIFIN in relation to ARIAO for reference ARI \n\u2264 3 (p<0.05). Both estimates of ARI showed reduced variabilities at higher values of \nreference ARI (Fig. 1, bottom).  \n \nFigure 3 represents the population ensemble average ARI(t) for the time-varying \nstaircase simulation, together with representative data from a 65 year-old male \nsubject. Both mean ARIFIN(t) and mean ARIAO(t) showed considerable differences in \nrelation to the correct value of ARI, but for ARIAO(t) the error decreases for higher \nvalues of ARI. For simulations with SNRV \u2265 20 dB, ARIAO(t) followed the correct \nvalue with much greater accuracy, but the ARIFIN(t) error remained approximately the \nsame. At each transition of the reference ARI(t) staircase, there was a slow response \nfor both estimates of ARI(t), due to the duration of the estimation window which was \n60 s in all cases (Fig. 3B). \n \n3.2 Patient data  \nRepresentative estimates of ARI(t) are given in Fig. 4 for both MCAs. Most subjects \nshowed wide variations in ARI(t), often including values of ARI=0 and ARI=9 in the \nsame segment of data as shown in Fig. 4E and 4F. For the population as a whole, \nintra-subject mean values of ARI(t) were not significantly different from estimates \nfrom the entire record (Table 2), but the intra-subject variability was considerable, as \nexpressed by the CoV in Table 2. ARIFIN was significantly higher than ARIAO for \nboth MCAs (right p<0.05; left p<0.01). Figure 5B complements the information in \n 10 \n \nTable 2 by showing the population cumulative probability distribution for ARI(t). \nNoteworthy, estimates derived from both the Finapres and intra-aortic pressure had \nvery similar incidence of values in the [0-0.5] bin range. \n \nHighly significant correlation coefficients (p<0.001) were obtained between ARI(t) \nestimates from the right and left MCA for both ARIFIN and ARIAO, respectively 0.60 \u00b1 \n0.20 and 0.56 \u00b1 0.22. Likewise, there was good correlation between the invasive and \nnon-invasive estimates for each MCA side, corresponding to 0.70 \u00b1 0.21 for the right \nMCA and 0.74 \u00b1 0.22 for the left MCA. A sensitivity analysis performed with values \nof NW above and below 60 s and values of Nfit above and below 12 s led to slightly \nsmaller correlation values in comparison with the values above. On the other hand, \nreducing Nfit to 6 s reduced the coefficient of variation (Table 2) by approximately \n40% (data not shown). \n \nLinear regressions between intra-subject CoV of ARI(t) for both MCAs and CoV of \nBP were not significant for either BPAO or BPFIN.  \n \n 11 \n \n4. Discussion \n \n4.1 Influence of the Finapres \nIn a previous study, estimates of dynamic CA obtained with the Finapres were shown \nto produce single values of ARI that were greater than corresponding measures \nderived from intra-aortic BP recordings, although the differences were relatively \nsmall (Sammons et al 2007). However, there were reasons to suspect that the Finapres \ncould lead to much greater differences in continuous estimates of dynamic CA. First, \nreducing the data window for estimating parameters like the ARI is bound to increase \nthe variability of estimates and their bias. Second, previous attempts to extract \ncontinuous estimates of ARI, using only the BPFIN as the input signal, showed that \nsudden drops of ARI(t) were a fairly frequent occurrence and led to the hypothesis that \nsuch nonphysiological behaviour could be caused by temporary malfunction of the \nFinapres (Panerai et al 2003b). Finally, another recent study showed that despite a \nnull-bias between the Finapres and intra-aortic BP, relatively large transient \ndifferences in systolic, diastolic and mean BP can occur, lasting approximately 20 s \n(Panerai et al 2007). These transient drifts of the Finapres could then lead to much \nlarger localized differences in ARI(t) when compared to estimates derived from the \nentire record (ARISINGLE). These expectations were not supported by the results of this \ninvestigation. In the simulations (Figs 2 & 3), ARIFIN was significantly higher that \nARIAO, but this could have been due to using BPAO as the reference signal with added \nnoise. Nevertheless, the differences were not greater than previously observed for \nestimates derived from the entire record (Sammons et al 2007) using real patient data. \nLikewise, both the intra-subject variability and the CoV did not show significant \ndifferences between BPFIN and BPAO estimates (Table 2) and the correlation \ncoefficients between right and left MCA estimates of ARI(t) were not significantly \ndifferent from those for ARIAO, either. As shown in Fig. 5B, the probability \ndistributions of ARIFIN and ARIAO were similar and the number of \u201ecrashes\u201f to ARI = \n0 (Figs. 4E & 4F) were also equivalent as shown by the % of values for ARI < 0.5. \n \n \n4.2 Physiological significance of short-term changes in cerebral autoregulation \nThe conclusion that the Finapres does not distort continuous estimates of ARI, in \ncomparison with values extracted with BPAO, provides reassurance about the validity \n 12 \n \nof previous studies of the longitudinal variability of dynamic CA, that were performed \nusing only the Finapres (Chen et al 2006, Giller and Mueller 2003, Latka et al 2005, \nLiu et al 2005, Mitsis et al 2004, Panerai et al 2003a, 2003b). The problem of \nvalidating methods to describe the non-stationarity of dynamic CA can be appreciated \nwhen it is considered that a \u201egold standard\u201f for dynamic CA does not exist, even \nunder the assumption that CA does not show short-term variability (Panerai 1998). \nUnder these circumstances, the use of surrogate data can provide some indication \nabout the reliability of time-varying estimates of dynamic CA. In other words, given \nthe patterns of variability exemplified by the subject in Fig. 4, to what extent can we \ntrust that such wide short-term changes are truly physiological? If that is not the case, \nthen what is being observed is the result of inappropriate methods (e.g. ARMA + \nARI), noise, or a combination of both. \n \nIn the absence of noise, simulations with a fixed value of ARI showed a negligible \nbias for estimates of ARI(t) obtained with the ARI model fitted to the CBFV step \nresponse obtained with the ARMA method (Fig. 1). Although Simpson et al (2004) \nshowed that the Tiecks model discriminates poorly between different values of ARI \nfor estimates derived from spontaneous fluctuations in BP and CBFV, this problem \nshould be much attenuated by first calculating the CBFV step response therefore \navoiding the application of equations (1-4) directly to the data (Panerai et al 2003b). \nThus, accepting that the estimation of ARI by means of the CBFV step response is an \nunbiased and consistent estimator as shown by the results in Fig. 1, the next question \nis to assess its robustness to noise. As shown by Figs. 1 and 2, the influence of noise \nis dependent on the value of ARI. It is not entirely clear why the bias for ARI=0 is \nmuch higher than corresponding values for ARI = 9, given that both are in the \nextremes of the closed interval [0,9]. On the other hand, it is understandable that the \nCoV for ARI=0 should be the highest (Fig. 1B) since the denominator would tend to \nbe lower than for other values of ARI. Despite reducing the SNRV to 0 dB, the bias \nobserved for values of ARI=5 remained relatively low and the CV reached a \nmaximum of 40%. \n \nAlthough the true SNRV of CBFV is not known, an approximation can be derived \nfrom the coherence function between BP and CBFV. Several research groups have \nshown that the coherence tends to be less than 0.5 at very low frequencies (VLF < \n 13 \n \n0.07 Hz), rising above 0.5 at higher frequencies (>0.1 Hz) (Panerai et al 1998, Panerai \net al 2006, Zhang et al 1998). The low coherence at VLF has been attributed to the \nnon-linear relationship between CBFV and BP due to changes in CVR (Panerai et al \n2006). For this reason the VLF band is not suitable for estimating the SNRV, but this \nproblem should not exist at higher frequencies where dynamic CA is not as effective. \nUnfortunately, the limitation in this case is the relatively low amount of spectral \npower in the BP and CBFV signals which would make estimates less reliable at \nhigher frequencies. As a compromise, the coherence at 0.1 Hz was chosen to identify \nthe equivalent level of band-filtered noise to be added to the simulated, noise-free \nvelocity signal generated with eqs. (1-4). Using previously reported values of \ncoherence between BPAO and CBFV, the appropriate SNRV was found to be 3 dB. \nNoteworthy, this is a worst case condition because the true coherence between BPAO \nand CBFV is likely to be higher than 0.65 when the contribution of CVR (or RAP \u2013 \nresistance-area product) is taken into account (Panerai et al 2006). Performing \nrealistic simulations with SNRV = 3 dB confirmed the dependence of the bias and \nvariability on the simulated fixed value of ARI (Fig. 2). Moreover, the corresponding \nprobability distributions (Fig. 5A) suggest that sudden drops to ARI = 0 (Figs. 4E & \n4F) do not tend to occur for values of ARI \u2265 4. By interpolation, the equivalent value \nof fixed ARI that would lead to the same incidence of zero values as in the real data \n(Fig. 5B) would be ARI = 2.3. One possible interpretation, is that sudden drops, or \n\u201ecrashes\u201f to ARI = 0 can take place, due to the presence of noise,  when the true \nphysiological ARI approaches values \u2264 3 .  \n \nThe evidence provided by simulation studies, that short-term variability in continuous \nestimates of dynamic CA reflect true physiological changes, is supported by previous \nreports in the literature. Czosnyka et al (1997) adopted a correlation index between \nBP and ICP (PRx) with a moving window of 200 s. They observed both short-term \nand day-to-day changes in CA in head injury patients, but some of those changes \ncould have been caused by physiological instability in critically ill patients. Under \nmore stable physiological conditions, Mitsis et al (2004) showed longitudinal \nfluctuations in frequency-domain estimates of multivariate, non-linear, first- and \nsecond-order kernels for the effects of BP and PaCO2 on CBFV, using a sliding \nwindow of 6 min. duration. Using the phase difference between CBFV and BP, as an \nindicator of dynamic CA (Birch et al 1995, Diehl et al 1995), Latka et al (2005) \n 14 \n \nperformed wavelet analysis to obtain time-varying changes in phase which showed \nvery rapid fluctuations, similarly to that we observed with ARI(t). Instantaneous \nchanges in phase were also reported by Chen et al (2006), using a Hilbert transform \napproach. Large intra-subject variability in phase could be observed in healthy \nsubjects at rest (their Fig. 3c), but unfortunately CoV or other measures of variability \nwere not presented. Giller and Mueller (2003) performed time-frequency analysis \nshowing an intermittent agreement between BP and CBFV in healthy subjects. These \nfindings let the authors to conclude, in their own words, that \u201cautoregulation is \nimpaired intermittently in normal subjects, challenging the belief that autoregulation \nis normally invariant and stable\u201d. Finally, to avoid the interference of any system \nidentification methods, large spontaneous transients in BP were compared to \ncorresponding transients in CBFV. Dramatic differences in temporal patterns also \nsuggested that dynamic CA can present major longitudinal changes in healthy \nindividuals  (Panerai et al 2003a). Despite the need to replicate these isolated \nfindings, in this case the lack of standardization can be seen as beneficial since it \nshows that short-term variability of dynamic CA is manifested through a diversity of \nmethodological approaches. \n \nIn summary, continuous estimates of dynamic CA seem to reflect spontaneous \nfluctuations of autoregulatory mechanisms at rest, but considerable more work is \nneeded to shed light on the physiological processes involved and to improve and \nstandardize analytical methods. \n \n4.3 Limitations of the study \nDoppler ultrasound measurements of CBFV will only reflect changes in CBF if the \ndiameter of the insonated artery (i.e. MCA) remains constant. Several previous studies \nhave failed to demonstrate that major changes in MCA diameter can take place during \nrecordings at rest, even in situations involving large changes in BP and PaCO2 \n(Newell et al 1994, Serrador et al 2000). Nevertheless, changes in MCA diameter \ncould modulate the CBFV beat-to-beat signal and contribute to the short-term \nvariability of ARI(t) or other continuous measures of dynamic CA. This possibility is \nnot very likely though, because dynamic CA is mainly manifested through temporal \ncharacteristics of beat-to-beat patterns of CBFV, such as the phase lead in relation to \nBP, rather than its absolute amplitude. \n 15 \n \n \nThe use of spontaneous BP fluctuations to obtain estimates of dynamic CA can only \nproduce reliable results if there is enough \u201einput power\u201f, or BP variability in the first \ninstance (Liu et al 2005, Panerai et al 2001, Panerai et al 2006, Simpson et al 2004, \nZhang et al 1998)). ABP variability is thought to decrease with ageing and for this \nreason, given the mean age of our population (Table 1), it could lead to unreliable \nestimates of ARI(t) in our case, to the extent of producing the sudden drops in ARI(t) \nshown in Figs. 4 and 5. There are several reasons why this possibility was unlikely. \nFirst, as shown in Fig. 4, during the sudden drops in ARI(t), ABP variability is no \ndifferent from other periods when ARI(t) was more stable. We compared the CoV of \nABP of our subjects with data from previous studies which included a wider range of \nages (Panerai et al 2001, 2003a, 2003b, 2006) and found similar distributions for the \nCoV of BP. Finally, linear regression analyses of the intra-subject variability of ARI(t) \nas a function of BP variability (CoV) were not significant and recordings with \nelevated dispersion of ARI(t) values occurred for cases with low, medium and high BP \nvariability. \n \nFor ethical reasons, measurement of intra-aortic BP was only possible in patients \nundergoing catheterization for clinical indications. The subjects we studied had \ncoronary artery disease and were likely to have an increased probability of having \nboth extracranial and intracranial atherosclerotic disease. For the study of the \ninfluence of estimates derived from BPFIN, in comparison with corresponding \nmeasures obtained from BPAO, each subject acted as his\/her own control and the \nlevels of agreement observed suggest that their upper peripheral circulation was free \nfrom severe occlusive disease. Their mean values of ARI (Table 2) were also in good \nagreement with other studies based on healthy subjects, which seems to suggest the \nabsence of severe carotid artery disease (Panerai et al 2001, Tiecks et al 1995, White \nand Markus 1997). Future studies are needed to compare the short-term variability of \nARI(t) found in this investigation with that of healthy individuals and patients with \ncerebrovascular diseases such as stroke or intracranial hypertension. \n \nMore work is also required on several methodological aspects of the approach \nadopted to quantify the temporal evolution of dynamic CA. Simulations of the \ninfluence of additive noise using random band-pass gaussian noise are only an \n 16 \n \napproximation since the true nature and pathways of other physiological influences, \nsuch as fluctuations in PaCO2, which would behave as \u201enoise\u201f in the identification of \nthe relationship between CBFV and BP, are not known. A moving window of 60s \nduration affords 100 data points with sampling interval of 0.6 s which should be \nenough to provide reliable estimates of ARI(t) when it is taken into account that the \noriginal proposal to derive the ARI from thigh cuff manoeuvres was based on a 30 s \ndata window (Tiecks et al 1995). Our initial tests did not show significant \nimprovement or deterioration when NW was changed to 120 s or 30 s. One obvious \nconsequence of the choice of NW though is the temporal resolution of ARI(t) estimates \nas shown in Fig. 3B. For bedside monitoring, this time delay is unlikely to be a \nserious problem, but shorter time windows might be beneficial in studies involving \ninterventions such as head-up tilt, sit-to-stand manoeuver or exercise. The data \nwindow was centralized at the current sample for offline analysis (Fig. 3) but in real \ntime applications only past samples could be used and the time delay will shift \naccordingly. Finally, the choice of ARI as a measure of dynamic CA is not critical \neither since other parameters like the CBFV-BP phase difference of the CBFV step \nresponse would be equally valid. The advantages of using the ARI though, are a \npreviously validated scale (Tiecks et al 1995) and its popularity in clinical studies of \ndynamic CA (Dawson et al 2000, Panerai et al 2004, White and Markus 1997). \n \n5. Conclusions \n \nContinuous estimates of dynamic CA obtained from noninvasive measurements of \nbeat-to-beat BP in the finger are not substantially different from corresponding values \nderived from intra-aortic BP recordings. Surrogate data showed that a moving \nwindow ARMA method combined with the estimation of an index of dynamic CA \n(ARI) can reproduce step changes in CA, but the presence of noise in the velocity \nsignal can lead to increasing bias and variability of estimates, mainly at low values of \nARI. Further research is needed on the physiology of short-term variability of \nautoregulatory mechanisms and also on the suitability of different techniques for \nanalysis of short-term fluctuations in healthy subjects and patients with \ncerebrovascular disease. \n \n \n 17 \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe are grateful to Professor David H.
