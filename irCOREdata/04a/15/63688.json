The screens \ntransmitted c. 79%, 68%, 48%, 41% and 31% of daily UV-B radiation dose. Plants from under \nand outside the screens were sampled seven times over 35 d. Correlative analyses indicated that \nconcentrations of an anthocyanin-like pigment located in leaf tips were positively associated with \nUV-B transmission at the last two samplings, that concentrations of total chlorophylls were \nnegatively associated with UV-B transmission at the final sampling, and that those of UV-B \nscreening pigments were positively correlated with transmission at three intermediate samplings. \nChlorophyll a \/ b ratio did not respond to the applied treatment. Plants exposed to low UV-B \ntransmission levels were visibly greener than those exposed to high transmission levels after \napproximately 23 d. The closest fits between the treatment and concentrations of UV-B screening \npigments were associated with increased ambient biologically-weighted UV-B dose received by \nplants in the 5.5 h before each sampling, which coincided with the passage of the ozone hole over \nRothera Point. As C. varians emerged from melting snow and ice, concentrations of the \nanthocyanin-like pigment and chlorophyll respectively increased and decreased faster in plants \nexposed to high transmission levels of UV-B, relative to those exposed to low UV-B transmission \nlevels.  \n \n  \n \n  \n2\nKeywords: anthocyanin, Cephaloziella varians, chlorophyll, stratospheric ozone depletion, UV-B \nscreening pigments \n \n1. Introduction \nPost and Vesk (1992) demonstrated that the dark purple form of the Antarctic leafy liverwort \nCephaloziella varians (Gottsche) Steph., which is found in sunlit locations, accumulates a dark \nwall-bound anthocyanin-like pigment in its leaf tips and contains less chlorophyll than the green \nform, which is found in shaded habitats. Previous research suggests that these differences in the \npigmentation of C. varians between sunlit and shaded habitats may be owing to exposure to UV-\nB (280-315 nm) radiation. The accumulation of anthocyanins and related pigments in plant \ntissues is often induced by exposure to UV-B radiation, through the induction of genes encoding \nkey enzymes in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway (Mol et al., 1996). Exposure to UV-B \nhas also been shown to reduce chlorophyll concentrations in plant tissues (e.g. Ruhland and Day, \n2001), although this is not a generic response across a broad range of plant species (Searles et al., \n2001; Robinson et al., 2003). Further research suggests that other pigments in C. varians tissues \nalso respond to UV-B exposure: concentrations of UV-B screening pigments, which, along with \nanthocyanins, are products of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, correlate significantly \nin C. varians tissues with rapid between-day fluctuations in UV-B doses received by plants at \nRothera Point on the Western Antarctic Peninsula (Newsham et al., 2002). This observation \nimplied that these pigments respond within 24 h of exposure to UV-B radiation, demonstrating a \nremarkably rapid response to an environmental factor in such a cold habitat (Newsham et al., \n2002). \nIn order to explicitly test whether these changes to the pigmentation of C. varians are \ninduced by solar UV-B radiation, we deployed a novel combination of plexiglass panes and \npolyester sheets over the liverwort growing at Rothera Point in late austral spring 1998. Similar \nstudies in Antarctica have used single-factor ANOVA analyses to compare the responses of plants \nunder acrylic screens providing a reduced UV-B treatment with those under a near-ambient and \nan ambient UV-B control (e.g. Ruhland and Day, 2000, 2001; Lud et al., 2003). However the \n  \n \n  \n3\ndesign of the screens used in the present study allowed us to examine dose-response relationships \nbetween UV-B exposure and pigment concentrations with correlative analyses. Late spring 1998 \non the Antarctic Peninsula was characterised by early melt of snow and ice covering vegetation, \nfrequent cloudless skies and the regular passage over the region of the Antarctic \u2018ozone hole\u2019, \ni.e., a mass of stratospheric air depleted in ozone (Farman et al., 1985), making it an ideal period \nin which to determine the effects of UV-B radiation on plant pigmentation in the natural \nenvironment.  \n \n2. Materials and methods \n2.1. Screen design and deployment \nUV-B doses received by plants were manipulated in situ by the use of 10 screens. Each screen \nconsisted of two juxtaposed 3 mm thick plexiglass panes (0.65 \u0001 0.65 m; GS2458, R\u00f6hm GmbH \n& Co. KG, Darmstadt, Germany), which transmitted the majority of UV-B radiation (67%, 93% \nand 95% transmission at 280 nm, 300 nm and 315 nm, respectively), placed onto nuts which were \nscrewed onto studding fixed to angle aluminium struts (Fig. 1). Eight of the 10 screens each had a \n100 \u0002m thick Mylar polyester sheet (0.6 \u0001 0.6 m; A.R. Warne & Co., Ltd., London, UK), which \nstrongly absorbed UV-B radiation (0% and 3.5% transmission at 313 nm and 315 nm, \nrespectively), mounted between the two plexiglass panes. The use of a plexiglass pane either side \nof the polyester sheeting ensured that it withstood the strong winds that regularly occur at \nRothera Point. Two of these eight screens received an intact Mylar sheet, and, to achieve a dose-\nresponse surface suitable for correlative analysis, the remaining six screens received Mylar sheets \nfrom which 25 equidistant holes of three different diameters had been cut (Fig. 1). Each of two \nscreens received Mylar from which 48 mm, 68 mm and 96 mm diameter holes had been cut, \nwhich removed 12.5%, 25% and 50% of the surface area of Mylar, respectively. These screens \nare hereafter referred to as small, medium and large hole screens, respectively. Those not \ncontaining Mylar and those containing intact Mylar sheets are hereafter referred to as no Mylar \nand full Mylar screens, respectively. Rubber tubing was placed onto the studding either side of \n  \n \n  \n4\nthe plexiglass panes to protect them from mechanical damage and wing nuts were placed onto the \nstudding to secure the panes (Fig. 1). \nThe 10 screens were deployed over C. varians growing amongst the moss Sanionia \nuncinata in an unshaded, low-lying gully fed by meltwater at Rothera Point on the Wright \nPeninsula, Adelaide Island, western Antarctic Peninsula (67\u00b0 34\u2019 S, 68\u00b0 07\u2019 W) on 17 November \n1998. Plants had emerged from melting ice and snow during the preceding week. Meltwater from \na nearby ice cornice was the principal source of water for plants during the study: snow events \nwere infrequent and rainfall did not occur, obviating the need for perforated screens, which are \nused at lower latitudes to allow precipitation to reach plants (e.g. Robson et al., 2003). Screen \nsurfaces were angled at c. 12\u00b0 to the horizontal and the lowest edge of the screens faced \nnorthwards to attenuate maximum UV-B radiation at solar noon. Rocks from the gully were \nplaced over the ends of the aluminium struts in order to weigh the screens down. The Mylar \nsheets were replaced weekly on the day after each sampling to ensure that the transmission \nproperties of the polyester did not alter during the course of the experiment. Strong winds \ndislodged a large hole screen early in the experiment. This screen was excluded from further \nanalyses.  \nIn order to estimate the dose of UV-B radiation received by plants under screens, two \nbroad band UV-B sensors (SKU 430; Skye Instruments Ltd., Llandrindod Wells, UK) were \nconnected to a datalogger (CR10; Campbell Scientific Ltd., Loughborough, UK), one sensor was \nplaced under the centre of a screen placed in the gully from which plants were sampled and the \nother sensor was placed in an unshaded location 1.5 m from the screen. The sensors had a peak \nresponse at 290 nm and were cosine corrected with minimal error below angles of 70\u00b0 to the \nperpendicular and small (< 5%) errors between 70\u00b0 and 80\u00b0. Sensor output was recorded for 24 h \nunder each of the five types of screens during cloudless days in January and February.  \n \n2.2. Sampling and pigment analyses \nSamples of three C. varians colonies (c. 25 mm \u0001 25 mm) were removed from as close as \npossible to the centre of each screen, to avoid edge effects, < 30 min. after deployment. Three \n  \n \n  \n5\nlarger (c. 50 mm \u0001 50 mm) samples of C. varians were also collected at positions within the gully \nnot shaded by screens or the ice cornice. Samples were placed into plastic bags and kept in the \ndark prior to pigment extraction. Triplicate samples from under each screen and from unshaded \nareas in the gully were then collected at solar noon (13:30 hrs local time) on 19 and 24 November \n1998 and at 7 d intervals thereafter until 22 December 1998. The samples were returned to a \nlaboratory c. 500 m from the gully in which the screens were deployed. The uppermost 2-3 mm \nof foliage was cut from each sample and, to facilitate grinding, it was blotted on absorbent paper \nuntil no free water could be drawn from the tissues (Post and Vesk, 1992). Preliminary analyses, \nusing the spectrophotometric methods described below, indicated that this process removed c. 2% \nof the pigments analysed for in this study from tissues. Samples from the same screen were \ncombined, and each sample, including the three separate samples from outside the screens, was \nthen divided into three c. 100 mg subsamples. Two of the subsamples were ground separately \nwith c. 1.5 g of silver sand in a mortar with a pestle for 0.5 min. To extract chlorophylls, 3 ml of \nmethanol was added to the first subsample and the tissues were ground for 1 min. The extracts \nwere then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min at 0 \u00b0C and 700 \u0002l of these extracts were passed \nthrough 0.45 \u0002m filters (Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, UK). To extract UV-B \nscreening pigments and the anthocyanin-like pigment, 3 ml of a 70:20:1 mixture of methanol, \nwater and HCl was added to the second subsample and the tissues were ground for 1 min (Post \nand Vesk, 1992). The extracts were heated at 65 \u00b0C for 10 min and were then centrifuged at 6000 \nrpm for 10 min, the supernatants removed and placed in a refrigerator, and a further 1 ml of the \nmethanol, water and HCl mixture was added to the pellet, which was resuspended before heating \nagain at 65 \u00b0C for 10 min. The supernatants were combined and 700 \u0002l of the extracts passed \nthrough 0.45 \u0002m filters. The third subsample was dried to constant weight (60 \u00b0C for 48 h) to \nenable pigment data to be expressed on a per g dry weight basis.   \nExtracts were transferred to UV grade polymethyl methacrylate semi-microcuvettes \n(PMMA; Kartell spa, Milan, Italy), diluted and absorbances were measured immediately in a \nspectrophotometer. To estimate concentrations of chlorophylls a and b, absorbances of methanol \nextracts were measured at 653 and 666 nm and concentrations of pigments calculated from \n  \n \n  \n6\nstandard formulae (Lichtenthaler and Wellburn, 1983). Weights of total chlorophyll (i.e., \nchlorophyll a + b) extracted per g dry weight of tissue and chlorophyll a \/ b ratios were \nsubsequently calculated. To estimate concentrations of UV-B screening pigments, the absorbance \nof each acidified methanol extract was measured between 280 and 315 nm (step 1 nm). The \nconcentration of the anthocyanin-like pigment was estimated by measuring the absorbance of \nacidified methanol extracts at 495 nm (Post and Vesk, 1992). Concentrations of UV-B screening \npigments were expressed in arbitrary units as the area under the absorbance curve (AUC280-315) \nper g dry weight of tissue. Data for the anthocyanin-like pigment were expressed in arbitrary \nunits as A495 per g dry weight. Sample preparation and analyses were conducted in dim light and \nwere usually completed within 2 h of sampling. \n \n2.3. Ozone column, irradiance and temperature measurements \nOverpass measurements of ozone column depth over Rothera Point (Fig. 2a) for 16 November - \n12 December 1998 were obtained from the Earth Probe Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (EP-\nTOMS) through the world wide web (http:\/\/jwocky.gsfc.nasa.gov). Global spectral irradiance \n(280-600 nm, step 0.5 nm) was recorded between 16 November and 18 December 1998 by a \ndouble monochromator grating spectroradiometer (Bentham DM150; Bentham Instruments Ltd., \nReading, UK) situated in the laboratory in which pigment analyses were made. The instrument \nrecorded data every 30 min between 08:00 and 19:00 hrs local time. The spectroradiometer was \ncalibrated against a 1000 W quartz-halogen tungsten coil filament lamp that had been calibrated \nrelative to National Institute of Standards and Technology standards. Data from the instrument \nwere not available for 25 and 26 November 1998 and 19-22 December. Spectral data for these \ndays were recorded at Palmer Station on Anvers Island, situated c. 380 km north of Rothera \nPoint. Studies indicate close rank correlations between daily doses of UV-B and PAR received at \nthe two locations (rs = 0.94 and 0.92, respectively, both P<0.001, n = 689; H.J. Peat et al., \nunpublished). Spectral data were expressed as the daily doses of biologically effective UV-B \n(UV-BBE), weighted with the generalized plant action spectrum (Caldwell 1971) and normalized \nat 300 nm (Fig. 2b), or PAR (Fig. 2c). Ambient air temperatures (Fig. 2d) were recorded every 5 \n  \n \n  \n7\nmin. during the experiment by two platinum resistance thermometers (PT100; Labfacility Ltd., \nTeddington, UK), within a Stevenson screen situated c. 300 m from the gully in which the \nscreens were deployed. The temperatures of the uppermost 2-3 mm of colonies outside screens \nand under a no Mylar screen were recorded at each sampling, except on 17 November, with a \nhand-held digital thermometer with a penetration probe (Checktemp HI98501; Hanna \nInstruments Inc., Woonsocket, RI, USA). \n \n2.4. Statistical analyses \nAssociations between plant pigmentation and percentage UV-B transmission at each sampling, \nincluding the time zero sampling on 17 November, were tested by Pearson\u2019s product-moment \ncorrelations. Mean values derived from each treatment level and from uncovered plants were \nentered into these analyses (hence d.f. = 5). Correlative analyses were also used to test the \ncloseness of fit between correlation coefficients (r) derived from these analyses for pigments at \neach sampling and ambient UV-BBE received by plants 5.5, 24 and 48 h before each sampling. \nRegression analyses were used to determine the slopes for the associations between time (day) \nand mean pigment concentrations or chlorophyll a \/ b ratio at each UV-B transmission level. \nStandard errors of slopes derived from these analyses were then used to compare differences in \npigment accumulation or loss under different UV-B transmission levels.  \n \n3. Results \n3.1. Screen performance \nThe screens used in our study sequentially reduced daily doses of UV-B radiation: analyses of \ndata obtained from the broad band sensors indicated that no Mylar, large, medium, small hole and \nfull Mylar screens transmitted c. 79%, 68%, 48%, 41% and 31% of daily UV-B dose, \nrespectively (Fig. 3a). Optimal attenuation of UV-B radiation was achieved at solar noon, with \nminimal attenuation in the early morning and late evening when the Sun was at its lowest \nelevation (Fig. 3b). During overcast periods on 19 and 24 November, and 8 and 22 December, the \nmean temperatures of colonies at noon under and outside screens were 2.2 \u00b0C and 1.9 \u00b0C, \n  \n \n  \n8\nrespectively. Under cloudless skies at noon on 1 and 15 December, the mean temperatures of \ncolonies under and outside screens were 17.4 \u00b0C and 13.1 \u00b0C, respectively.  \n \n3.2. Plant pigmentation \nPigment concentrations or chlorophyll a \/ b ratio were not significantly associated with \npercentage UV-B transmission on 17 November (Table 1). However, there were significant \npositive associations between UV-B transmission and the concentration of the anthocyanin-like \npigment at the final two samplings on 15 and 22 December (Table 1, Fig. 4a, b). In contrast, \nconcentrations of total chlorophyll were negatively associated with UV-B transmission on 22 \nDecember (Table 1, Fig 4c). These changes in concentrations of chlorophyll and the anthocyanin-\nlike pigment were evident from visual inspection of the plants: after 10 December, those under \nfull Mylar screens were greener than those under no Mylar screens and those from outside \nscreens. Chlorophyll a \/ b ratio did not respond to the sequential reduction in UV-B radiation \n(Table 1). The concentrations of UV-B screening pigments were positively associated with UV-B \ntransmission on 1, 8 and 15 December (Table 1, Fig. 4d-f).  \nThe closeness of fit between UV-B transmission level and concentrations of UV-B \nscreening pigments was associated with the recent UV-B environment, which was in turn \nassociated with ozone column depth over Rothera Point (Fig. 2a, inset): there was a significant \npositive association between r values derived for UV-B screening pigments (Table 1) and UV-\nBBE dose received 5.5 h before sampling took place (Fig. 4f, inset). Associations between r values \nfor UV-B screening pigments and UV-BBE  dose received 24 h and 48 h before sampling were not \nsignificant. Similarly, there were no significant associations between UV-BBE dose received 5.5 h, \n24 h or 48 h before sampling and r values derived for chlorophyll, chlorophyll a \/ b ratio or the \nanthocyanin-like pigment (data not shown).  \nRegression analyses indicated that slopes for the associations between time and chlorophyll \na \/ b ratio, concentrations of UV-B screening pigments or the anthocyanin-like pigment, were all \npositive (Table 2). The slopes were significant at the 100% and 79% UV-B transmission levels \nfor concentrations of UV-B screening pigments and the anthocyanin-like pigment, respectively, \n  \n \n  \n9\nand at the 41% and 48% UV-B transmission levels for chlorophyll concentrations (Table 2). \nConcentrations of the anthocyanin-like pigment increased faster in plants exposed to the 79% \nUV-B transmission level than in those exposed to the 31% transmission level (Table 2). In \ncontrast, chlorophyll accumulated faster during the study in plants exposed to the 31%, 41% and \n48% UV-B transmission levels, compared with plants exposed to the 68% and 100% \ntransmission levels (Table 2). Although these analyses indicated no effects of UV-B transmission \nlevel on changes in chlorophyll a \/ b ratio over the course of the experiment (Table 2), we \nrecorded a consistent rise in this ratio at all transmission levels from 1.45 on 17 November to \n2.46 on 8 December (r = 0.973, P = 0.005). \n \n4. Discussion \nOur study demonstrates that a sequential reduction of UV-B radiation dose in the natural \nenvironment alters the pigmentation of C. varians. It shows that the accumulation of the \nanthocyanin-like pigment in sun-exposed C. varians reported by Post and Vesk (1992) most \nprobably arises from exposure to UV-B radiation: after 28 and 35 d, tissues of plants exposed to \nlow doses of UV-B radiation contained substantially less of the anthocyanin-like pigment than \nthose exposed to high doses. Similar effects of UV-B radiation on the accumulation of \nanthocyanins in plant tissues are well documented (Chalker-Scott, 1999). Furthermore, our study \nindicates that the reduced chlorophyll concentrations in sun-exposed C. varians tissues reported \nby Post and Vesk (1992) are also most probably owing to UV-B radiation exposure. After 35 d, \nchlorophyll concentrations in tissues of plants exposed to reduced UV-B were almost twice those \nof tissues exposed to high doses of UV-B. Although many studies have recorded no effect of UV-\nB radiation on chlorophyll concentrations in plant tissues (Searles et al., 2001), this is not an \nunprecedented result: for example, concentrations of chlorophyll b are reduced by 46% in leaves \nof Antarctic Pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) exposed to ambient UV-B, compared with leaves \nof plants exposed to reduced UV-B (Ruhland and Day, 2001).  \nThese effects of UV-B on plant pigmentation at individual samplings were supported by an \nanalysis of pigmentation under different UV-B transmission levels over the course of the \n  \n \n  \n10\nexperiment. These analyses indicated that the concentration of the anthocyanin-like pigment \nincreased faster in plants exposed to high UV-B doses, relative to plants exposed to reduced \nirradiances of UV-B. Conversely, chlorophyll concentrations increased in plants exposed to low \nUV-B doses and the pigment was lost from plants exposed to high doses. These data suggest that, \nin a similar response to juvenile reddening of emerging herbaceous seedlings (Chalker-Scott, \n1999), exposure to UV-B radiation induces the production of the anthocynanin-like pigment in C. \nvarians tissues as plants emerge from melting snow and ice at the end of austral spring, and that \nchlorophyll may be lost from tissues at this time. During this period we also recorded a rise in \nchlorophyll a \/ b ratio from 1.45 to 2.46, the same value as that recorded by Post and Vesk \n(1992). This is analogous to the response recorded by Martin and Churchill (1982), who found \nthat chlorophyll a \/ b ratio declined in a range of mosses after canopy closure in a temperate \nforest. However our data suggest that exposure to UV-B radiation is unlikely to explain the \nchange in this ratio over the course of our experiment.  \nOur study shows that C. varians increases the synthesis of UV-B screening pigments with \nincreased exposure to UV-B radiation. This observation corroborates those from previous \nexperiments into the effects of UV-B radiation on Antarctic vascular plants: higher \nconcentrations of UV-B screening pigments have been consistently recorded in tissues of C. \nquitensis and Antarctic Hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica) exposed to near-ambient or ambient \nUV-B radiation, relative to plants exposed to reduced UV-B (Ruhland and Day, 2000; Ruhland \nand Day, 2001; Xiong and Day, 2001). It also corroborates previous data showing positive \nassociations between concentrations of UV-B screening pigments in C. varians tissues and daily \ndoses of UV-BBE received at Rothera Point (Newsham et al., 2002). The data reported by \nNewsham et al. (2002) were based upon correlations between plant pigmentation and UV-B \nexposure over 60 days, increasing the degrees of freedom in statistical analyses to an order of \nmagnitude greater than in the present study. It is hence difficult to make a direct comparison \nbetween these data and those from the current study. However both studies indicate that exposure \nto UV-B radiation elicits the production of UV-B screening pigments in C. varians foliage. This \nis the most consistent response of a wide range of plant species to elevated UV-B in outdoor \n  \n \n  \n11\nirradiation experiments (Searles et al. 2001). \nAlthough we used lower replication here than in our previous study, the present data \nfurther support the view that C. varians apparently responds to rapid fluctuations in UV-B \nirradiance (Newsham et al., 2002): the best fits between UV-B transmission level and \nconcentrations of UV-B screening pigments were associated with the dose of UV-BBE radiation \nreceived on the morning prior to each sampling. This suggests that UV-B screening pigments \nresponded more consistently to the treatment under depleted ozone columns and indicates that the \npigmentation of these plants may have responded within several hours of exposure to UV-B \nradiation. Despite daily mean air temperatures of between -5 and 2 \u00b0C, the temperature of C. \nvarians colonies beneath screens reached 17 \u00b0C under cloudless skies, which would have enabled \nrapid responses of plant pigmentation to the rapidly-fluctuating radiative environment. Studies on \ntemperate plant species also indicate rapid responses of UV-B screening pigments to changes in \nUV-B radiation. For example, the induction of messenger RNA transcripts encoding for \nflavonoids, a common group of UV-B screening pigments in plant tissues, occurs within several \nhours of exposure to UV-B radiation (Jordan et al., 1994).  \n Given the apparent speed of response of UV-B screening pigments to the fluctuating UV-B \nenvironment at Rothera Point, it is probable that these pigments play a role in protecting C. \nvarians from elevated UV-B radiation (Newsham et al., 2002). The majority of UV-B screening \npigments in plant tissues are products of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, and hence \ncontain carbon ring structures which are efficient at absorbing UV-B radiation (Cockell and \nKnowland, 1999). However, although anthocyanins and related pigments are also products of the \nsame pathway and contain ring structures, they only absorb UV-B inefficiently (Chalker-Scott, \n1999; Cockell & Knowland 1999). The anthocyanin-like pigment present in C. varians tissues, \nalthough it may be induced by UV-B exposure, is hence unlikely to offer substantial protection \nfrom UV-B radiation. Furthermore, the pigment does not apparently respond to rapidly-\nfluctuating UV-B irradiances. This view is supported by the absence of correlations between the \ncloseness of fit of the treatment on concentrations of the pigment and doses of ambient UV-BBE \nradiation received by plants in this study. Concentrations of the pigment in plants sampled at \n  \n \n  \n12\nnoon from outside screens on 43 consecutive days in spring and summer 1998 are also not \nassociated with daily doses or noon irradiances of solar UV-B received at Rothera Point (K. \nNewsham, unpubl.). Similarly, chlorophyll did not appear to respond rapidly to UV-B exposure \nin our study, as there were no associations between the closeness of fit of the treatment on \nchlorophyll concentrations and doses of UV-BBE received by plants. Our data indicate that the \nreduced concentration of this pigment observed at high UV-B doses in our study may have been a \nlong-term response to the treatment. This view corroborates the data of Newsham et al. (2002), \nwho concluded that chlorophyll concentrations in C. varians tissues were not associated with \nrapidly-changing UV-B irradiances received by plants at Rothera Point. \nThe screens used in our study were ineffective at attenuating UV-B radiation when the \nSun was at a low elevation. Poor attenuation of UV-B radiation at these times could have been \neliminated by the use of vertical walls at the sides and backs of screens. However, previous \nstudies have found that under cloudless skies such walls result in up to 20 \u00b0C increases in the \ntemperatures of plants and soil beneath screens relative to ambient (Kennedy 1995). Hence, in \nour study, we chose to omit walls from screens and found that under cloudless skies the \ntemperatures of colonies beneath screens were only up to 4.9 \u00b0C higher than of those outside \nscreens. It is possible that these differences in the temperatures of colonies under and outside the \nscreens may have influenced pigment concentrations, but concentrations of pigments in plant \ntissues under no Mylar screens and in plants from outside screens were similar, increasing our \nconfidence that these temperature increases had little influence on pigment concentrations. \nAlthough the screens used in the present study were successful at sequentially reducing \nthe daily doses of UV-B radiation received by plants, future studies may benefit from making \naccurate PAR measurements under screens and from modifying the design of screens used here. \nSimultaneous measurements of UV-B and PAR received by plants under screens would enable \nUV-B to PAR ratio to be calculated for each transmission level, which would allow an \nexamination of the relationship between this variable and concentrations of pigments, such as \ncarotenoids, which are associated with UV-B to PAR ratio in C. varians (Newsham et al., 2002). \nChanges to the number and size of holes in the polyester might also improve screen performance. \n  \n \n  \n13\nThe current design of screen would have led to heterogeneous effects on the irradiances of UV-B \nreceived by individual plants throughout each day. For example, a plant beneath an area of Mylar \npolyester in a small, medium or large hole screen would have received substantially less direct \nUV-B irradiance at solar noon than during periods when the zenith angle of the Sun enabled the \nplant to receive direct irradiance through the holes in the polyester. This would have introduced \nheterogeneity into plant response to the changing UV-B irradiances throughout each day. Future \nstudies using the technique described here might hence be improved by the use of polyester \nsheets from which differing numbers of holes of equal but small size are cut. This would, at least \nto some extent, reduce the heterogeneous effect of the screens on the irradiances of UV-B \nreceived by plants throughout each day. \n \nAcknowledgements \nFunding from the UK Natural Environment Research Council and support from staff at Rothera \nresearch base, particularly Roger Worland and Rod Arnold, are gratefully acknowledged.
