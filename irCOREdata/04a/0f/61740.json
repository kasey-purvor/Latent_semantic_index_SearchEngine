The slope-17 \nbased Grid-to-Grid (G2G) model adequately simulated observed river flows under current climate 18 \nconditions for high relief catchments, but was less successful when applied to lower-relief and\/or 19 \ngroundwater-dominated areas. The model has now been enhanced to employ a soil dataset to configure 20 \nthe probability-distributed store controlling soil-moisture and runoff generation within each grid-cell. A 21 \ncomparison is made of the ability of both models to simulate gauged river flows across a range of 22 \nBritish catchments using observations of rainfall and PE as input. Superior performance from the 23 \nenhanced G2G formulation incorporating the soil dataset is demonstrated. 24 \n 25 \nFollowing the model assessment, the observed precipitation and PE data used as input to both 26 \nhydrological models were replaced by RCM estimates on a 25 km grid for a Current (1961 to 1990) 27 \nand a Future (2071 to 2100) time-slice. Flood frequency curves derived from the flow simulations for 28 \nthe two time-slices are used to estimate, for the first time, maps of changes in flood magnitude for all 29 \n2 \nriver points on a 1 km grid across the UK. A high degree of spatial variability is seen in the estimated 1 \nchange in river flows, reflecting both projected climate change and the influences of landscape and 2 \nclimate variability. These maps also highlight large differences between the climate impact projections 3 \narising from the two models. The improved structure and performance of the soil-based G2G model 4 \nadds confidence to its projections of flow changes being realistic consequences of the climate change 5 \nscenario applied. A resampling method is used to identify regions where these projections may be 6 \nconsidered robust. However, with the climate change scenario used representing only one plausible 7 \nevolution of the future climate, no clear message can be drawn here about projected river flow changes. 8 \n 9 \n 10 \nKEYWORDS 11 \nRainfall-runoff model; Regional climate model; flood frequency: climate change 12 \n 13 \nIntroduction 14 \n 15 \nAn analysis of precipitation records over the period 1961 to 2000 (Osborn and Hulme, 16 \n2002) indicates that UK precipitation has tended to become more intense in winter 17 \nand less intense in summer. The impact of such changes in rainfall on river flows will 18 \ndepend on both the nature of the rainfall and the physical characteristics of the 19 \ncatchment. For fast-responding catchments, such as those in impermeable or high 20 \nrelief areas, the features of the specific rainfall event are critical. Such catchments 21 \ntend not to have the deep soils or permeable geology that lead to the long-term 22 \nhydrological \u201cmemory\u201d often exhibited by larger lowland rivers. Many drainage areas 23 \nin Southeast England, including the Thames Basin, are typical of lowland catchments 24 \nwhere the long-term balance between rainfall and evaporation can have an important 25 \ninfluence on flood response to storm rainfall. 26 \n 27 \n3 \nOver the past thirty to forty years there has been some evidence of a positive trend in 1 \nhigh river flow indicators in the maritime\u2013influenced upland areas of North and West 2 \nBritain (Hannaford and Marsh, 2008). Such trends are generally thought to be linked 3 \nto changes in winter precipitation arising from changes in atmospheric circulation 4 \npatterns. However \u201clittle compelling evidence\u201d was found for a trend towards higher 5 \nflows in lowland areas of South and East Britain. Analyses of much longer flow 6 \nrecords spanning the 20\nth\n century (Black, 1996; Robson, 2002; Hannaford and Marsh, 7 \n2008) have so far detected no apparent long-term trend in UK flood magnitude. 8 \nHannaford and Marsh (2008) note that over the last century the increasing 9 \ntemperatures observed in the UK are likely to have directly influenced key processes 10 \naffecting floods: notably a decrease in snowmelt-induced floods and occurrence of 11 \nfrozen ground since the 1960s, and temperature-induced changes in evaporation 12 \n(which can affect soil moisture deficits and flood generation). 13 \n 14 \nCurrent UK guidance on how to consider the potential impacts of climate change on 15 \nflood flows when planning flood defence schemes states that \u201cThe limited number of 16 \ncatchments researched to date supports applicability of a 20% allowance to the 2080s 17 \nfor peak river flow\u201d (Defra, 2006). Most research investigations into the effects of 18 \nclimate change on UK river flows, including that which led to the Defra (2006) 19 \nguidance for flood defences, have used catchment hydrological models to provide 20 \nestimates of changes in flow for a single location, or a small set of locations: 21 \nexamples are Kay et al. (2009), New et al. (2007), Fowler and Kilsby (2007), Wilby 22 \nand Harris (2006), Wilby et al. (2006), Nawaz and Adeloye (2006), Cameron (2006), 23 \nKay et al. (2006), Arnell (2003) and Reynard et al. (2004). Generally, the 24 \nhydrological model is calibrated to catchment conditions, using model parameters to 25 \n4 \nadjust the modelled catchment response to rainfall, in order to allow for the spatial 1 \nheterogeneity of soil, geology, topography and land-cover. The model parameters can 2 \nalso be adjusted to take into account artificial influences on flows, such as water 3 \nabstraction.  4 \n 5 \nHere we use a single, grid-based model (Grid-to-Grid, or G2G) and a single set of 6 \nparameters for the whole of the UK to simulate the different responses of catchments 7 \nto rainfall and evaporation, using digital datasets of landscape properties to provide 8 \nthe spatial differentiation. In order to determine the effect of hydrological model 9 \nstructural quality on river flows, estimates from an enhanced G2G model, which 10 \nincludes the effect of soil properties on runoff production, are compared to those from 11 \nthe slope-dependent G2G model used in previous assessments of changing flood risk 12 \n(Bell et al., 2007a,b). These two model variants are distinguished here using the 13 \nnames \u2018Soil-G2G\u2019 and \u2018Slope-G2G\u2019 respectively. Estimates of river flows from both 14 \nmodel variants are compared to observed flows for a large set of catchments using 15 \nhistorical observations of rainfall and potential evaporation (PE) as model input. 16 \nModel performance for different sizes and types of catchment across Britain is 17 \nassessed. Bell et al. (2007a) found that the Slope-G2G provided reasonably good flow 18 \nestimates for high relief catchments, but was less effective in areas of lower relief or 19 \nwhere groundwater processes have a significant influence on river flows. The 20 \nenhanced G2G model formulation presented here attempts to overcome these 21 \ndeficiencies, and contains further developments to the prototype Soil-G2G 22 \nformulation previously trialled in some Upper Thames catchments (Moore et al., 23 \n2007, 2006a,b).  24 \n 25 \n5 \nUse of a grid-based hydrological model in conjunction with high-resolution climate 1 \nmodel output has made it possible here, for the first time, to estimate the spatial 2 \neffects of climate change on peak river flows across the UK. Observations of rainfall 3 \nand PE used to calibrate and assess both hydrological models are replaced by 4 \nRegional Climate Model (RCM) estimates on a 25 km grid and at hourly intervals 5 \n(daily for PE) for a Current (1961 to 1990) and a Future (2071 to 2100) time-slice. 6 \nFlood frequency curves derived from the flow simulations for both time-slices are 7 \nused to produce maps of changes in flood magnitude for river points on a continuous 8 \n1 km grid across the UK. These maps indicate a high degree of spatial variability in 9 \nthe sensitivity of UK rivers to future changes in climate. The resilience, or 10 \n\u201crobustness\u201d, of the modelled changes in flood magnitude is investigated using a 11 \nresampling method. Areas of the UK are identified for which confidence in the 12 \nprojected changes under this regional climate model scenario is greatest.  13 \n 14 \n 15 \nThe hydrological models 16 \n 17 \nTwo hydrological model formulations are compared, one for which runoff production 18 \nis parameterised in terms of slope (Slope-G2G), and one which introduces the effects 19 \nof soil\/geology on runoff production and catchment response (Soil-G2G). The models 20 \ncan be configured for use at (almost) any spatial resolution, with the temporal 21 \nresolution determined by numerical stability criteria. They are run here at a 1 km 22 \nresolution and for a 15 minute time-step over a UK model domain. The models 23 \nemploy Digital Terrain Model (DTM) data to support their configuration and 24 \nparameterisation. A modular formulation allows model revisions and extensions to be 25 \n6 \nmade. In order to represent spatial heterogeneity within each 1 km grid-cell, and to 1 \nensure that each cell generates realistic quantities of saturation-excess runoff even 2 \nwhen it is not fully saturated, the probability-distributed soil moisture store 3 \nformulation of Moore (1985, 2007) has been invoked in both models. Runoff from a 4 \ncell soil column is considered to consist of the saturation-excess surface flow and the 5 \ngroundwater sub-surface flow. These runoffs from each cell form the lateral inflows 6 \nto the G2G flow routing scheme. The scheme as presented in Bell et al. (2007a) 7 \nconsists of a kinematic wave formulation for routing both surface and sub-surface 8 \ngridded runoffs. This scheme has been further enhanced to include dependence on 9 \nriver width and slope when used to represent river channel flow processes. 10 \n 11 \nThe G2G can be used in two ways: first as an area-wide model providing flow 12 \nestimates over a large region, and secondly as a catchment model which may be 13 \ncalibrated to obtain the best possible agreement between modelled and observed 14 \nflows. As an area-wide model, the G2G can be less accurate for a particular catchment 15 \nthan a model specifically calibrated to the catchment, but is well suited to support 16 \nriver flow simulation at any set of locations within a region. As a consequence, the 17 \nmodels are able to be calibrated to groups of gauged locations within a region and 18 \nriver flow simulations extracted for any ungauged location within the same area. 19 \n 20 \nThe structure and performance of the two formulations of the G2G model, with area-21 \nwide calibrations, is assessed here with reference to observed flow records for 22 \ncatchments across Britain. Model performance will impact on the quality of the flood 23 \nfrequency curves derived from the river flow simulations and on the reliability of the 24 \nassessment of change in flood frequency under a future climate. 25 \n7 \n 1 \nA description of each G2G model formulation follows. The Slope-G2G has already 2 \nbeen presented in detail (Bell et al., 2007a), so only a brief description is provided 3 \nhere for comparison with the Soil-G2G. 4 \n 5 \nThe Soil-G2G: a distributed grid-based model incorporating soil information 6 \n 7 \nConsider a sloping soil column of depth L  and slope 0s  subject to precipitation 8 \nfalling at a rate p  and with an evaporation rate Ea as shown in Figure 1. Some of the 9 \nrainwater entering the soil column can drain laterally to adjacent grid-squares, while 10 \nsaturation-excess flow contributes to surface runoff. Water also moves downwards via 11 \npercolation and drainage which eventually contributes to groundwater (sub-surface) 12 \nflow.  13 \n 14 \nSoil-moisture and surface runoff-production in the Soil-G2G  15 \n 16 \nThe actual, maximum \u2018available\u2019 and residual water storages (water depth per unit 17 \narea) in the soil column are given by  18 \n 19 \n LS r )( \u03b8\u03b8 \u2212=  (1) 20 \n 21 \n LS rs )(max \u03b8\u03b8 \u2212= , (2) 22 \n 23 \n LS rr \u03b8=\u2032  (3) 24 \n 25 \n8 \nwhere \u03b8 , s\u03b8  and r\u03b8  are the actual, saturation and residual water contents (water 1 \nvolume per unit volume of soil). The total water stored is denoted rSSS \u2032+=\u2032 , which 2 \ncan take a maximum value of rSSS \u2032+=\u2032 maxmax . The residual water rS \u2032  held under 3 \ntension forces is not available for drainage but can contribute to evaporation.  4 \n 5 \nLet SxV 2\u2206=  denote the volume of available water stored in the unsaturated layer of 6 \nthe soil column of a given grid-square cell of side length x\u2206 . From continuity, the 7 \nrate of change in water volume is given by 8 \n 9 \n spLia qqqqxEp\ndt\ndV\n\u2212\u2212\u2212+\u2206\u2212= 2)( , (4) 10 \n 11 \nwhere iq  is the rate of inflow to the cell from contributing upstream cells, Lq  is the 12 \nlateral drainage rate from the cell, pq is the downward percolation (drainage) rate to 13 \nthe saturated zone and sq  is saturation-excess surface runoff. This equation of 14 \ncontinuity is also used in the Slope-G2G formulation, but with 0=Lq . 15 \n 16 \nThe lateral drainage rate, Lq , is given by 17 \n 18 \n \u03b1\u03b1\n\u03b1\nxSCV\nx\nxC\nqL \u2206=\n\u2206\n\u2206\n=\n2\n. (5) 19 \n 20 \nThe conveyance term C is given by \u03b1max0 \/ SsLkC\nL\ns= , where 0s  is the local slope 21 \n(derived from digital elevation data) and Lsk  is the lateral saturated hydraulic 22 \n9 \nconductivity. A similar equation can be derived by integrating the Brooks-Corey 1 \n(1964) relation for hydraulic conductivity over the depth of soil column (Todini, 2 \n1995; Benning, 1995) with parameter \u03b1  the pore-size distribution factor (here, taken 3 \nto be unity). 4 \n 5 \nPercolation (a vertical downward flow from the soil column), pq , is represented as a 6 \nsimple power law function of the available soil water volume V , expressed as a 7 \nfraction of the saturated water volume maxV , 8 \n 9 \n \npp\nS\nS\nxk\nV\nV\nxkq\nv\ns\nv\nsp\n\u03b1\u03b1\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2206=\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2206=\nmax\n2\nmax\n2 , (6) 10 \n 11 \nwhere vsk  is the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil and p\u03b1  is the 12 \nexponent of the percolation function. Clapp and Hornberger (1978) indicate, on the 13 \nbasis of soil experiments, that p\u03b1  can vary from circa 11 for sand to 25 for clay. 14 \nFollowing tests, a constant value for p\u03b1  of 15 is assumed here (in the absence of a 15 \nsuitable spatial dataset). 16 \n 17 \nThe dependence of evaporation loss on total soil moisture content is introduced by 18 \nassuming the following simple function between the ratio of actual to potential 19 \nevaporation, EEa \/ , and soil moisture deficit, SS \u2212max : 20 \n 21 \n \n( ) e\nb\nr\na\nSS\nSS\nE\nE\n\uf8fe\n\uf8fd\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f3\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212=\n'\n1\nmax\nmax . (7) 22 \n10 \n 1 \nNote that evaporation can occur from water held under soil tension. This formulation 2 \nwas used within the PDM (Moore, 1985, 2007) where a value of be=2.5 is often 3 \nrecommended to obtain realistic variation in evaporation between seasons; this value 4 \nhas been used here. 5 \n 6 \nIn order to ensure that a grid-square generates realistic quantities of saturation-excess 7 \nsurface runoff sq  even when it is not fully saturated, the probability-distributed soil 8 \nmoisture store formulation of Moore (1985, 2007) has been invoked within each grid-9 \nsquare. This probability-distributed approach also forms the basis of the Xinanjiang 10 \nmodel (Zhao et al., 1980), the Arno model (Todini, 1996) and the VIC land-surface 11 \nmodel (Wood et al., 1992); an historical perspective citing earlier works is given by 12 \nMoore (1985). The conceptualisation represents the spatial variation in water 13 \nabsorption capacity with soil, geology, land-cover and topography across the grid-14 \nsquare by assuming the grid-square contains a distribution of store depths, c , with the 15 \ndepths dependent upon saturation and residual soil moisture. The distribution is 16 \nassumed to be of Pareto form with distribution function bcccF )\/1(1)( max\u2212\u2212=  17 \ndefined by two parameters: maxc  the maximum store depth and b  the spatial 18 \ndistribution (shape) parameter controlling the nature of the variation of store depth 19 \nbetween 0 and maxc .  20 \n 21 \nTotal soil moisture, rSStS \u2032+\u2261\u2032 )( , and surface runoff, )(tqqs \u2261 , are evaluated at 22 \neach time-step. The maximum total storage rSSS \u2032+\u2261\u2032 maxmax  is estimated from soil 23 \ndata on local saturation and the depth of the soil column. The variable )(** tCC \u2261  is 24 \n11 \nthe critical capacity below which all stores are full at some time t. The proportion of 1 \nthe grid-square containing stores of capacity less than or equal to *C  is 2 \n( ) ( ) ( ) =\u222b==\u2264 dccf CFCc Co**\n*\nprob .cC b)\/1(1 max\n*\u2212\u2212  This is the proportion of the 3 \ngrid-square from which the surface runoff qs is generated when net rainfall is positive. 4 \n 5 \nThe PDM rainfall-runoff catchment model assumes a single distribution of stores 6 \nacross a catchment, with the values of b and cmax determined through calibration with 7 \nreference to observed river flows. In contrast, the Slope-G2G exploits a relation 8 \nbetween store capacity and terrain slope to estimate the values of b and cmax from 9 \nDTM-derived slope data for each model grid-square (see section on Slope-G2G). For 10 \nthe Soil-G2G, a method to estimate b directly from soil properties, rather than through 11 \nterrain slope, was sought. Parameter values obtained by calibration of the standard 12 \nPDM lumped catchment model across a range of catchments, indicate that those with 13 \nlarger store capacity (large maxS \u2032 ) do tend to have smaller values of b, whereas those 14 \nwith shallow soils tend to have larger values of b. Results are shown in Fig. 2 for 37 15 \ncatchments across the UK and simple curve fitting indicates that the inverse square-16 \nroot relationship  17 \n 18 \n max\/2.5 Sb \u2032= ,  (8) 19 \n 20 \nprovides a reasonable approximation (coefficient of determination of 0.66). Soil data 21 \nwere used to provide an estimate of the total water stored maxS \u2032  from which b is then 22 \ncalculated using Eq. (8); this is done for each grid-square over the model domain. 23 \nTrials indicated that the relationship of Eq. (8) performed well except in areas with 24 \n12 \npermeable geology such as chalk downland. For these areas where stores are 1 \nparticularly deep ( 1>L  m), setting 0=b  had the effect of removing rapid 2 \nfluctuations in surface runoff and resulted in more realistically modelled river flows. 3 \nFor this case, all stores in a grid-square have the same capacity, cmax. 4 \n 5 \nEstimates for the four soil properties s\u03b8 , r\u03b8 , L and sk  (the saturated hydraulic 6 \nconductivity) are available from soil datasets for the UK at a 1 km resolution (details 7 \nare provided in a later section). The vertical component of the saturated hydraulic 8 \nconductivity vsk  is assumed to be linearly related to sk , through the relation s\nv\ns kk \u03bb= , 9 \nwhere \u03bb  is treated as a spatially invariant model parameter referred to as the drainage 10 \nconductivity multiplier. This additional parameter is required to take into account the 11 \nvertical variation in hydraulic conductivity not encompassed by values taken from the 12 \nUK datasets. The lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity, Lsk , is unknown but 13 \nfollowing initial trials of the G2G, it is assumed to be related to sk  via the relation 14 \ns\nL\ns kk 50= : this produces a moderate improvement in the timing of flow peaks in 15 \ngroundwater-dominated catchments. However, more extensive calibration has proved 16 \nimpossible, in part because most of the groundwater-dominated catchments in this 17 \nstudy are subject to abstraction and\/or uncertainty about the extent of the sub-surface 18 \ncatchment.\n \n19 \n \n20 \nThe facility exists to include a reduction of soil depth L from those provided by 21 \nnational datasets, for grid-cells containing significant urban and suburban areas, 22 \nthrough use of the LCM2000 spatial dataset of land-cover (Fuller et al., 2002). The 23 \nsoil depth is multiplied by the factor su \u03c6\u03c6 3.07.01 \u2212\u2212  where u\u03c6  and s\u03c6  are the 24 \n13 \nfractions of urban and suburban area within each grid cell. This reduction in soil 1 \nstorage will have the effect of increasing runoff, particularly surface runoff, in urban 2 \nareas leading to a faster response to rainfall. This responsiveness has been further 3 \nenhanced through the use of an increased routing speed in urban areas (see Section 4 \nEstimation of river flows by surface and channel flow routing models). 5 \n 6 \nSub-surface runoff-production in the Soil-G2G  7 \n 8 \nIt is assumed that percolation freely drains as recharge to the groundwater saturated 9 \nzone (for the cell), so that the recharge rate pr qq \u2261 . Let gV  denote the groundwater 10 \nvolume stored in the cell and bs  the slope of the underlying bedrock in the flow 11 \ndirection. Continuity for the groundwater volume is 12 \n 13 \n gp\ng\nqq\ndt\ndV\n\u2212=  (9) 14 \nwhere gq  is the lateral groundwater flow from the cell. Darcy\u2019s law gives the lateral 15 \ngroundwater flow out of the cell to a reasonable approximation by the linear relation 16 \n 17 \n g\nbg\ng V\nx\nsk\nq\n\u2206\n=  (10) 18 \n 19 \nwhere gk  is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer. This is appropriate 20 \nfor a confined aquifer. However, suitable values for bedrock slope, bs , and 21 \nconductivity, gk , are not straightforward to obtain. One approach is to assume that 22 \nbedrock slope mirrors the surface topographic slope which can be estimated from 23 \n14 \ndigital terrain data. Conductivity information may be obtained from geology datasets 1 \nbut obtaining meaningful values for the present scale of application may present 2 \ndifficulties. Geological datasets have not been used for the present model application. 3 \nInstead, a nonlinear storage function relating groundwater flow to volume has been 4 \ninvoked, such that 5 \n 6 \n \nm\nggg Vq \u03ba= , 0>g\u03ba , 0>m , (11) 7 \n 8 \nwhere g\u03ba  is a rate constant and m  is the nonlinear power. For this application, a cubic 9 \nstorage function has been assumed ( m =3), and g\u03ba  is treated as a spatially invariant 10 \nparameter for estimation. 11 \n 12 \n 13 \nEstimation of river flows by surface, subsurface and channel flow routing models 14 \n 15 \nRunoff from the soil column is considered to consist of the saturation-excess flow, sq , 16 \nand groundwater flow, gq . These runoffs from each cell form the lateral inflows to 17 \nthe Grid-to-Grid flow routing scheme comprising of two parallel coupled equations 18 \nrepresenting the surface and subsurface flow pathways respectively. The scheme (Bell 19 \net al., 2007a,b) employs a kinematic wave equations in 1-dimension of the form: 20 \n 21 \n )( Ruc\nx\nq\nc\nt\nq\n+=\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202\n (12) 22 \n 23 \n15 \nwhere q  is either surface or subsurface flow, R  denotes return flow per unit path 1 \nlength (water transfer between subsurface and surface pathways), and u  represents 2 \nlateral inflows per unit path length, which include runoff generated by the runoff-3 \nproduction scheme. The wave speed c can vary with the pathway (surface or 4 \nsubsurface) and surface-type (land or river) combination. 5 \n 6 \nInvoking forward difference approximations to the derivatives in (12) gives the 7 \ndiscrete formulation 8 \n 9 \n ( ) ( )nknknknknk Ruqqq +++\u2212= \u2212\u2212\u2212 1111 \u03d1\u03d1  (13) 10 \n 11 \nwhere k and n denote positions in discrete time and space respectively, the 12 \ndimensionless wave speed xtc \u2206\u2206= \/ \u03d1  and 10 << \u03d1 . This is a simple, explicit 13 \nnumerical formulation for the kinematic wave equation with nku  and \nn\nkR  now the 14 \nlateral inflow and return flow over the path length. This numerical scheme has the 15 \nadvantage of introducing diffusion (albeit numerically) and so more closely represents 16 \nthe propagation of actual flow through the landscape. Figure 3 summarises the key 17 \nfeatures of the coupled runoff-production and routing scheme.  18 \n 19 \nThis finite-difference scheme forms the basis of the routing component of both the 20 \nSoil- and Slope-G2G. In each case, the routing is implemented in terms of an 21 \nequivalent depth of water in the surface or sub-surface store over the grid square, ,nkS  22 \nwith nk\nn\nk Sq \u03ba=  and where xc \u2206= \/\u03ba  is a rate constant with units of inverse time and 23 \nx\u2206 is the grid-cell size. The inflow and return flow are also re-expressed in terms of 24 \n16 \nwater depth for calculation purposes. In the Soil-G2G, return flow from the sub-1 \nsurface to the surface is estimated as tSrSrR niki\nn\nbkb\nn\nk \u2206+= \/)( , which includes a 2 \ncontribution directly from the soil column, while for the Slope-G2G return flow is a 3 \nproportion of the sub-surface flow only, i.e. tSrR nbkb\nn\nk \u2206= \/ . In both cases,\nn\nbkS  is the 4 \ndepth of water in the sub-surface routing store, br  is the return flow fraction and for 5 \nthe Soil-G2G, ir  is the return flow fraction from the soil store and \nn\nikS  is the depth of 6 \nwater in the soil column. For diagonal flow-paths the distance travelled across the 7 \ngrid-cell is increased by a factor of 2 . 8 \n 9 \nIn the Soil-G2G, routing along surface pathways of river channel type employs the 10 \nHorton\u2013Izzard nonlinear storage approach (Dooge, 1973; Moore and Bell, 2001) 11 \napplied to a varying width channel network (Ciarapica and Todini, 2002; Moore et al., 12 \n2007) and exploits geomorphological relations developed by Bell and Moore (2004). 13 \nIn this case the momentum equation is given by the Manning equation mCSq = , 14 \nwhere S  is the water depth, the conveyance nsC \/0=  where 0s  is the channel bed 15 \nslope and n is Manning\u2019s roughness coefficient, and 3\/5=m . Without change of 16 \nnotation, to simplify presentation, this routing scheme is developed below for a river 17 \ngrid cell within the modelled domain. 18 \n 19 \nAssuming a network structure of channel reaches with wide rectangular cross-sections 20 \nof width, w , increasing downstream, then the kinematic wave routing scheme for a 21 \nreach is 22 \n 23 \n17 \n c\nm\nm\nqqV\nxw\nCw\nq\ndt\ndV\n\u2212=\n\u2206\n\u2212=\n)(\n. (14) 1 \n 2 \nHere, V  is the volume stored in the reach, qc is the outflow, and the inflow q  is made 3 \nup of two components: the surface runoff sq , which includes return-flows from the 4 \nsoil and groundwater store, and the channel inflow from upstream \nu\ncq . The channel 5 \nbed slope, 0s , is here assumed equal to the mean slope of the grid-cell. Standard 6 \ntables of Manning\u2019s n  can be used to assign values to each cell if information on the 7 \ntype of channel is available. Alternatively, a channel ordering system, such as that due 8 \nto Strahler, could be invoked with the support of a digital terrain model and used to 9 \nallow roughness to decrease with increasing stream order. Here, a constant roughness 10 \nhas been assumed within and across all cells for simplicity. In practice, the kinematic 11 \nwave routing scheme with varying cross-sectional width used here is 12 \n 13 \n20\n*\nV\nw\nsc\nq\ndt\ndV r\u2212= , (15) 14 \nwhere *rc  is a routing parameter with units of s\n-1\nm-5\/2. 15 \n 16 \nTo estimate channel width w, the approach of Bell and Moore (2004) has been 17 \nfollowed. They obtained the following relationship for bankfull width using 18 \nobservations of bankfull river dimensions published by Nixon (1959) for 27 19 \ncatchments across the UK ranging in size from 157 to 9948 km\n2\n: 20 \n 21 \n ,\n1000\n9134.0\n139.1\n5121.0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n= SAARb\nR\nAw  (16) 22 \n18 \n 1 \nwhere A is the area drained (km\n2\n) and RSAAR is the Standard Average Annual Rainfall 2 \n(mm) over this area. This has been applied to each cell containing a river channel to 3 \nobtain estimates of w. 4 \n 5 \nThe kinematic wave routing scheme for channel flow given by equation (14) takes the 6 \ngeneral nonlinear reservoir (Horton-Izzard) form 7 \n 8 \n \nm\nkVu\ndt\ndV\n\u2212=\n (17) 9 \n 10 \nwhere V  is the volume of water in the channel and the quantities u  and k  are 11 \nconstants within a time-step. An integral solution of this equation is available for 12 \ncalculation purposes based on an approximation suggested by Smith (1977) for the 13 \ngeneral case, or analytical expressions for specific cases: see Moore and Bell (2002) 14 \nand Moore et al. (2007) for further details. For the present application, involving 15 \nspecifically Eq. (15), the analytical solution for the quadratic case (m=2) is used.  16 \n 17 \nFor the Soil-G2G the responsiveness of the catchment to rainfall in urban areas has 18 \nbeen further enhanced by increasing the routing parameter, k , by a factor of 2 for 19 \ngrid-cells where the fraction of urban area, 25.0>u\u03c6 .  20 \n 21 \nThe slope-dependent Grid-to-Grid Model  22 \n 23 \n19 \nA full description of the slope-dependent G2G model structure and its configuration 1 \nto the UK is presented in Bell et al. (2007a). A simple runoff production scheme 2 \nbased on terrain slope is used following methodology developed for the CEH Grid 3 \nModel (Bell and Moore, 1998a,b) to derive surface and sub-surface runoffs from 4 \ngridded rainfall and potential evaporation inputs. The Slope-G2G formulation 5 \nassumes that grid-cells with less steep slopes have deeper soil stores, and are less 6 \nimmediately responsive to rainfall than steeper areas.  7 \n 8 \nAt a point it is assumed that the moisture storage capacity, c , is related to the local 9 \ntopographic slope, 0s , such that 10 \n 11 \n maxmax\n0\n01 c\ns\ns\nc \uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2212= , (18) 12 \n 13 \nwhere max0s  and maxc  are regional maximum values of slope and capacity respectively. 14 \nFurther, it is assumed within a grid-square that the variation in slope has a distribution 15 \nfunction of power form such that bsssF )\/()( max000 = , \nmax\n000 ss \u2264\u2264 . It follows from 16 \nderived-distribution theory that capacity c  has the Pareto distribution 17 \nb\ncccF )\/1(1)( max\u2212\u2212=  with spatial distribution (shape) parameter, b , related to the 18 \nmean slope, 0s , through the expression.  19 \n 20 \n  \ns  s\ns\n = b\n00\n0\n\u2212\n. (19) 21 \n 22 \n20 \nStandard PDM theory (Moore, 1985, 2007) can then be used to obtain the fraction of 1 \na grid-square that is saturated and generating runoff. Analytical expressions are 2 \navailable for calculating for every model time-step the volume of surface runoff and 3 \ntotal water storage, )(tS \u2032 , for each grid-square. The latter has a maximum value 4 \n)1\/(maxmax +=\u2032 bcS . DTM data (here, available on a 50 m grid) are used to estimate 0s  5 \nfor each grid-square and max0s , with maxc  treated as a regional parameter to be 6 \noptimised. Values for b  and maxS \u2032  can be calculated from these for all grid-squares. 7 \nNo data on soil properties are required with the Slope-G2G model variant as terrain 8 \nslope is used as a surrogate for the water holding capacity of the soil. The water 9 \nbalance calculations for the Slope-G2G take account of losses via evaporation and 10 \ndrainage in a similar way to that outlined for the Soil-G2G, but using a storage-11 \ndependent drainage function incorporating a soil tension threshold. 12 \n 13 \nThe routing component employed by the Slope-G2G has previously been outlined in 14 \nthe context of the Soil-G2G model variant. It essentially employs a kinematic wave 15 \nformulation that is equivalent in conceptualisation to a network cascade of linear 16 \nreservoirs. Surface and subsurface runoffs are routed via parallel fast and slow 17 \nresponse pathways linked by a return flow component representing stream-soil-18 \naquifer interactions. The terrain-following flow paths are configured using a DTM. 19 \n 20 \n 21 \nModel Configuration from digital datasets 22 \n 23 \nThe routing component of both the Slope- and Soil-G2G models requires two DTM-24 \nderived datasets: 25 \n21 \n 1 \n(i) flow directions (each grid-cell can drain in only one of 8 directions), 2 \n(ii) area draining to each 1 km grid-cell 3 \n 4 \nHere, the G2G model formulation is configured spatially using river networks and 5 \nterrain information derived from a 50m hydrologically corrected UK DTM, the 6 \nIHDTM (Morris and Flavin, 1990). The IHDTM is derived using Ordnance Survey 7 \n(OS) 1:50000 digitised contours and spot heights, and digitised river networks; it has 8 \na 0.1m vertical resolution. Although the IHDTM provides an accurate 50m grid of 9 \nflow-directions, the G2G routing scheme operates on a coarser 1km grid and is unable 10 \nto use these fine-scale flow-directions directly. This is a common issue in broad-scale 11 \ndistributed modelling, and has motivated the development of a range of methods to 12 \nextract low-resolution flow direction networks from high-resolution base datasets. In 13 \na recent assessment, Davies and Bell (2009) found that two derivation methods - the 14 \nNetwork Tracing Method (NTM, Fekete et al., 2001), and the COTAT+ method (Paz 15 \net al., 2006) - produced river networks that most closely resembled the base fine-scale 16 \n(50m) river networks. The COTAT+ raster-based scheme was considered slightly 17 \nbetter at estimating catchment areas. The accuracy of the COTAT+ river network 18 \nderivation method over the UK does not seem to depend greatly on the nature of the 19 \ntopography it is applied to. Indeed, Davies and Bell (2009) found that it performed 20 \nreasonably accurately across the whole of mainland Britain. Generally the percentage 21 \nerror in catchment area arising from the delineation of a catchment boundary using 22 \n1km-resolution flow-directions is less than 5%, although a few catchments have larger 23 \nerrors.  24 \n 25 \n22 \nThe runoff-production schemes for both G2G formulations require gridded estimates 1 \nof average terrain slope in each grid-cell. The slope of each 1 km grid-cell is 2 \ndetermined from the mean of the 50m grid-cell slopes contained in the 1 km grid-cell, 3 \nThese are estimated from the elevations of the 3\u00d73 cell neighbourhood surrounding 4 \neach cell using an average maximum technique (Burrough, 1986) as implemented in 5 \nESRI ArcGIS software. Note that this measure of cell mean slope will not necessarily 6 \nrepresent the slope of the river. 7 \n 8 \nAdditional data on soil properties is required by the Soil-G2G runoff-production 9 \nscheme. Here, a derived quantity called the HOST (Hydrology of Soil Types) class 10 \nhas been used to infer estimates of soil hydraulic properties across the UK. The HOST 11 \ndataset has a 1 km resolution and consists of 29 classes, encompassing soil type, 12 \nhydrological response and substrate hydrogeology (Boorman et al., 1995). Although 13 \nthis classification only provides an integer identifier for 29 different soil types, a 14 \ndatabase of derived soil attributes supports the derivation of these classes and consists 15 \nof properties such as air capacity, parent material, depth to gleying and depth to 16 \nslowly permeable layer. Highly derived soil properties have been extracted from a soil 17 \nproperties database called SEISMIC (Hallett et al., 1995), available from the National 18 \nSoil Resources Institute. In SEISMIC, soil series are analysed down to a depth of 1.5 19 \nm. By comparing information from SEISMIC with the HOST dataset, Ragab together 20 \nwith colleagues at CEH (pers. comm.) associated values of soil properties with each 21 \nof the 29 HOST classes. Relevant properties are as follows: 22 \n 23 \nhydraulic conductivity at saturation : sk  (cm d\n-1\n), 24 \nsoil depth to \u201cC\u201d and \u201cR\u201d horizons (cm), 25 \n23 \nwater content at field capacity, fc\u03b8 : fractional volume at 5KPa, 1 \nresidual water content, r\u03b8 : half the fractional volume at 1500KPa 2 \n 3 \nThe soil depths to \u201cC\u201d and \u201cR\u201d horizons consist of two values. The SEISMIC User 4 \nManual defines the C-layer as \u201cmineral substrate, relatively unweathered \u2018soft\u2019 5 \nunconsolidated material, gravel or rock rubble\u201d, and the R-layer as \u201crelatively 6 \nunweathered, coherent rock\u201d. The depth to the R-layer has been used here as a 7 \nsurrogate for soil depth. Where a value for depth to the R-layer is not available, the 8 \ndepth to the C-layer is used instead. In many cases (but not all), depth to the R-layer 9 \nfor each soil type is greater than the depth to the C-layer.  10 \n 11 \nThe residual soil water content, r\u03b8 , and the saturated hydraulic conductivity, sk , are 12 \nused directly in the Soil-G2G runoff production scheme. The water content at field 13 \ncapacity, fc\u03b8 , represents the water content below which drainage becomes negligible. 14 \nAs a rule of thumb (Or and Wraith, 2002), fcs \u03b8\u03b8 2= , where s\u03b8  is the water content at 15 \nsaturation, an estimate of which is required for the Soil-G2G runoff-production 16 \nscheme. However, values for fc\u03b8  associated with HOST classes from SEISMIC data 17 \nrange from 0.25 to 0.49 and seem rather large compared to literature values which 18 \nrange from 0.1 for fine sand to 0.39 for clay (Dunne and Leopold, 1978). For the 19 \npresent purposes it is assumed that fcs \u03b8\u03b8 25.1= , which results in values of s\u03b8  ranging 20 \nfrom 0.31 to 0.61.  21 \n 22 \n 23 \nHydrological and climate data 24 \n24 \n 1 \nObservation-based data for model calibration and assessment 2 \n 3 \nBoth variants of the G2G model are assessed here with respect to observed flows at 4 \nriver gauging station sites across the UK and using gridded time-series of 5 \nprecipitation and potential evaporation as model input. The precipitation data were 6 \ndaily values on a 5km grid derived from raingauge totals by the Met Office for the 7 \nperiod 1958 to 2002. In the present application, the G2G model runs at a 15-minute 8 \ntime-step, so the daily rainfall estimates are equally spread throughout the day. 9 \nPotential evaporation data were monthly values on a 40 km grid obtained from the 10 \n\u201cMet Office Rainfall and Evaporation Calculation System\u201d, MORECS (Thompson et 11 \nal. 1981, Hough and Jones, 1997). Monthly total PE estimates are spread equally 12 \nthroughout the month. This method is sufficient for PE input to rainfall\u2013runoff 13 \nmodels, since its effect on runoff production is as a cumulative control on soil water 14 \nstorage. 15 \n 16 \nThe Slope-G2G model had previously been assessed using observed (raingauge) and 17 \nmodelled (from an RCM driven by quasi-observed boundary conditions) rainfall data 18 \nas input (Bell et al., 2007a). The DTM-derived river-flow routing datasets used here 19 \ndiffer slightly to those described by Bell et al. (2007a,b), as derivation-methods for 20 \nflow paths and catchment boundaries have since been improved. This has required 21 \nminor adjustments to be made to the Slope-G2G model parameters. 22 \n 23 \nDaily flow records from 42 river gauging stations across Britain have been used in the 24 \nG2G model assessment. A map showing catchment boundaries and outlet locations is 25 \n25 \npresented in Fig. 4. The station names and identifiers (IDs) are listed in Table 1 1 \ntogether with catchment area and baseflow index (bfi). The baseflow index (Institute 2 \nof Hydrology, 1980) is a dimensionless measure (range 0 to 1) expressing the fraction 3 \nof river flow that derives from stored sources, such as groundwater. The catchments 4 \nwere chosen to represent a wide range of river regime, ranging from fast-responding 5 \nupland catchments (e.g. Taw, Dee) to baseflow-dominated river basins (e.g. Mimram, 6 \nLambourn). It is important to remember that artificial controls on flow, such as 7 \nreservoirs and abstractions for water supply, are not yet accounted for in the G2G 8 \nmodel. Neglecting the effect of groundwater abstractions on river flows will result in 9 \napparent overestimation of flows in affected areas, particularly during summer 10 \nmonths. Daily mean flow data for the catchments in Table 1, originating from the 11 \nEnvironment Agency, were obtained from the National River Flow Archive at CEH 12 \nWallingford.  13 \n 14 \nThe observed data record was divided into two separate periods for model calibration 15 \nand assessment. The calibration period was from 28 November 1980 to 18 December 16 \n1982 following a six-month period used for model initialisation; the period used for 17 \nmodel assessment ran from 1 January 1985 to 31 December 1993, again preceded by a 18 \nsix-month initialisation period.  19 \n 20 \n 21 \nRegional Climate Model data for climate change assessment 22 \n 23 \nThe RCM used is HadRM3H, here configured at a 25km resolution; a 50km version 24 \nwas previously employed to produce the UKCIP02 scenarios (Hulme et al., 2002). 25 \n26 \nRCM-derived hourly precipitation and daily estimates of potential evaporation have 1 \nbeen used as input to the G2G. The data are available for two time-slices:  2 \n\u2022 Current scenario from 1960 to 1990; 3 \n\u2022 Future scenario (SRES-A2; IPCC, 2000) from 2070 to 2100. 4 \nThe first 9 months of each was used to initialise the hydrological model, so each time-5 \nslice contains 30 whole water years (1 October to 30 September). It should be noted 6 \nthat an RCM \u2018year\u2019 consists of just 360 days (12 months each with exactly 30 days). 7 \n 8 \nHadRM3H is described in Buonomo et al. (2007), which compares the RCM 9 \nsimulations of precipitation with observations from a raingauge network over Great 10 \nBritain. The comparison indicates that HadRM3H realistically simulates extreme 11 \nprecipitation over time-scales of one to thirty days and return periods of two to twenty 12 \nyears. In particular, errors are generally no larger and sometimes smaller than those in 13 \nseasonal mean precipitation. Similarly, a study of extreme rainfall comparing 14 \nHadRM3H output and daily raingauge records from 204 sites across the UK by 15 \nFowler et al. (2005) found that the RCM provided a good representation of extreme 16 \nrainfall for return periods up to 50 years. The experimental run used here is a rerun at 17 \na higher resolution (25km) of one of the experiments used for UKCIP02. As RCM 18 \nrainfall is representative of average rainfall over a grid-box then rainfall events at 19 \nsmaller spatial scales, for example localised heavy convective precipitation, will not 20 \nbe captured in the models. This also means that changes in events of this nature will 21 \nnot be represented in the future climate scenario. However, as RCM summer rainfall 22 \ncompares well with observations when they have been aggregated onto the model 23 \ngrid, then clearly the RCM is able to capture the area-averaged effect of convective 24 \nrainfall. 25 \n27 \n 1 \nThe 25 km RCM precipitation has been downscaled to the 1 km UK National Grid 2 \nusing the procedure followed by Bell et al. (2007b). Higher spatial rainfall resolution 3 \nis provided by the standard average annual rainfall (SAAR) 1 km dataset for the 4 \nperiod 1961\u20131990. For each time-step, the rainfall for each RCM grid-square is 5 \nmultiplied by the ratio of RCM grid-square SAAR to the 1 km grid-square SAAR to 6 \nprovide rainfall on a 1 km grid. This determines whether some areas generally receive 7 \nmore or less rainfall than others, for instance as a consequence of topography. 8 \nPotential evaporation (PE) has been estimated from RCM outputs in a way that is as 9 \nconsistent as possible with the Penman\u2013Monteith equation (Monteith, 1965) as 10 \nimplemented in MORECS (Hough and Jones, 1997), but using RCM outputs instead 11 \nof synoptic station measurements. The hourly rainfall (daily PE) estimates are equally 12 \nspread throughout the hour (day), in line with the approach used for the model runs 13 \ndriven by observations.  14 \n 15 \n 16 \nG2G model calibration and assessment 17 \n 18 \nThe G2G model has been designed for area-wide application, providing estimates of 19 \nriver flows throughout a region, irrespective of catchment boundaries. Where 20 \npossible, the model is configured to a region, in this case the UK, using gridded 21 \ndatasets to represent spatial heterogeneity of hydrological response across grid-cells. 22 \nWith the use of greater process representation and ever-more detailed datasets one 23 \nmight expect that less calibration would be required to achieve an accurate 24 \nrepresentation of surface and sub-surface hydrology. However, many aspects of 25 \n28 \nsurface-groundwater interactions are complex, scale-dependent and still not fully 1 \nunderstood or measurable. Thus model calibration is still required to achieve better 2 \nagreement between modelled and observed river flows, particularly for groundwater-3 \ndominated regions. 4 \n 5 \nAs the G2G model is designed for area-wide use, care has been taken not to over-6 \ncalibrate the model to individual catchments for which flow observations are 7 \navailable. Instead, flow measurements for catchments with a predominant soil-type 8 \nhave been used to determine whether the hydraulic properties associated with the soil-9 \ntype provide realistic estimates of the relative volumes of surface and sub-surface 10 \nrunoff. Manual adjustment of soil hydraulic properties (usually effective soil depths) 11 \nis applied recursively to different catchments and sub-catchments until a good 12 \nestimate of downstream surface- and subsurface-flow volumes across a range of soil-13 \ntypes is achieved. The baseflow storage rate-constant parameter, g\u03ba , and drainage 14 \nconductivity multiplier, \u03bb , are adjusted as part of this runoff-calibration process, 15 \nalthough their effects are sometimes indistinguishable from the routing time-constant 16 \nparameters. Generally, adjustment of soil properties has been required for soils 17 \noverlying permeable geology, such as chalk, where the baseflow component of river 18 \nflow is dependent on the volume of water stored in both the soil and the bedrock. 19 \nWith the current absence of data to support estimates of groundwater hydraulic 20 \nproperties, storage in these areas has been augmented by increasing the effective soil 21 \ndepth and assuming that the soil hydraulic properties apply at all depths. This 22 \neffectively introduces a deeper unsaturated zone below the soil layer in some areas 23 \nassociated with chalk and Oolite formations. In time, greater availability of soil and 24 \n29 \ngeological data should provide additional information to underpin model constructs of 1 \nthis kind. 2 \n 3 \nParameters governing the temporal development of flow peaks are determined by 4 \nmanual calibration to observed flows at a number of locations. These consist of time-5 \nconstants for both the surface and sub-surface routing pathways, together with the 6 \nreturn-flow fractions, ir  and br , which determine the proportion of sub-surface water 7 \nthat passes into the river at each time-step. 8 \n 9 \nThe same calibration\/assessment procedure was followed for both the Slope-G2G and 10 \nthe Soil-G2G model variants. The results obtained for the nine-year assessment period 11 \nare shown in Fig. 5. Here, differences between observed and modelled daily mean flows 12 \nfor each catchment in Table 1 are expressed in terms of the R\n2\n statistic, also referred to as 13 \nthe \u201cNash-Sutcliffe Efficiency\u201d (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) or simply \u201cModel 14 \nEfficiency\u201d. This is defined as  15 \n( )\n( )\u2211\n\u2211 \u2212\n\u2212\n2\n2\n1\nQ - Q\nqQ\n  = R\nt\ntt2 , (20) 16 \nwhere Qt is the observed flow at time t, qt is the simulated flow and Q  is the mean of 17 \nthe observed flows over the n values involved in the summations. The R\n2\n statistic 18 \nprovides a dimensionless performance measure which expresses the proportion of 19 \nvariability in observed flows accounted for by the model simulation. A value of 1 20 \nindicates a perfect fit whilst a value of 0 indicates that the model is only as good as 21 \nusing the mean flow for model simulation. Note that R\n2\n can be negative if the model 22 \nsimulations are worse than that provided by the mean flow (assumed unknown when 23 \n30 \ndoing the model simulation). In the bar-charts of Fig. 5, negative R\n2\n values are 1 \nindicated with a token value of -0.05 for clarity. In all but three of the catchments, use 2 \nof the Soil-G2G leads to a more accurate simulation of observed river flows, even in 3 \nhigh relief areas where the Slope-G2G can be particularly effective. In the figure, the 4 \ncatchments are displayed in ascending order of their bfi: this serves to highlight the 5 \nbetter performance of the Soil-G2G in catchments where a larger proportion of the 6 \nriver flow derives from stored sources such as groundwater (i.e. where bfi is higher).  7 \n 8 \nFigure 6 presents hydrographs highlighting the improved performance of the Soil-9 \nG2G in two very different catchments; the Beult at Stile Bridge (bfi = 0.24) and the 10 \nLambourn at Shaw (bfi = 0.97). The enhanced simulation performance in the 11 \nLambourn is evident: however there is still room for improvement in groundwater-12 \ndominated areas. For example, neither model variant is able to simulate flows 13 \nadequately in the Mimram at Panshanger Park. This is probably because groundwater 14 \nabstraction in the headwaters of the Mimram reduces observed flows below what 15 \nwould be expected naturally, leading to an apparent overestimate in the model 16 \nsimulations. For another low relief catchment in South East England affected by 17 \nabstractions, the Thames to Kingston, naturalised observed flows are available in 18 \naddition to gauged flows. Here, a comparison between naturalised and Soil-G2G 19 \nmodelled flows indicates that the representation of natural processes by the Soil-G2G 20 \nmodel in groundwater-affected areas is reasonably good (Bell et al., 2008). 21 \n 22 \nOverall, the Soil-G2G model, which is supported by a range of digital datasets and 23 \nhas just one set of calibrated model parameters for the whole of the UK, simulates 24 \nriver flows reasonably well for a wide range of catchments. It performs very well for 25 \n31 \nmany catchments having a natural flow regime and for which the flow record is 1 \nbelieved to be accurate. The Slope-G2G performs well for catchments where runoff-2 \ngeneration is controlled by topography and where terrain slope serves as a good 3 \nsurrogate for soil depth (absorption capacity). However, it is less effective in lowland 4 \nareas where soil\/geology controls can dominate the hydrological response. Model 5 \nsimulations (for both formulations) are less accurate in catchments where the flow 6 \nregime is influenced by artificial abstractions and discharges, and where the sub-7 \nsurface hydrology is unusually complex (and not well understood). A rainfall-runoff 8 \nmodel calibrated to individual catchments can sometimes be adjusted to take such 9 \nartificial influences into account, but this is not an option for an area-wide model 10 \nconstrained to use one set of model parameters for all locations. Future model 11 \ndevelopment might include a scheme to incorporate losses due to groundwater 12 \nabstraction, such as the groundwater model component developed for the PDM by 13 \nMoore and Bell (2002).  14 \n 15 \n 16 \nImpact of hydrological model formulation on projected flow changes 17 \n 18 \nFollowing the assessment of G2G model performance across the UK for a wide 19 \nvariety of catchments, the Slope-G2G and Soil-G2G are used next to investigate the 20 \nimpact of RCM-estimated climate change on flood magnitude across the UK. This 21 \nallows an assessment to be made of the sensitivity of the estimated impacts to 22 \nhydrological model structure. Estimates of spatial changes in peak flow, for different 23 \nreturn periods, for river points on a 1km grid across the UK form the final output of 24 \nthis investigation into changing flood risk. 25 \n32 \n 1 \nIn order to be able to estimate flood frequency for each river point modelled by the 2 \nG2G, annual maximum (AM) flows are stored for each point by UK water-year (1 3 \nOctober to 30 September). The AM are then ordered and their Gringorten (1963) 4 \nplotting positions (estimates of the non-exceedence probability for each AM) 5 \ndetermined. A generalised logistic distribution, recommended for UK catchments by 6 \nRobson and Reed (1999), is then fitted to the AM at each point using L-moments. 7 \nThis method assumes stationarity over the data period and the fitted curve should not 8 \nbe used for extrapolation much beyond the data period length (in this case 30 years). 9 \n 10 \nFig. 7 maps the spatial changes in flood magnitude over the UK with river points 11 \ncolour-coded according to the percentage change in peak flow at 2, 10 and 20 year 12 \nreturn periods. The maps in the first and second rows are derived using the Slope-13 \nG2G and Soil-G2G respectively. Red and orange colours indicate a decrease in peak 14 \nflows under future climate conditions, blue and purple an increase, and yellow\/green 15 \nsmall decreases\/increases. Overall, the maps of changes in peak flows from both G2G 16 \nmodel variants are visually similar, particularly in high relief areas of North and West 17 \nBritain. For South East England and the Midlands there is more spatial and inter-18 \nmodel variation in the estimated impact of climate change on river flows. These 19 \nregions tend to have lower relief and spatially variable soil\/geology and include areas 20 \nwhere groundwater is a significant component of river flow. A large variation in 21 \npercentage change in peak flows is apparent in individual river reaches (e.g. Thames, 22 \nSevern), reflecting the differing response of subcatchments draining to them. Note 23 \nthat although the colour scale of Fig. 7 indicates projected decreases of over 60% and 24 \nincreases as high as 200% or more, there are very few of these areas in the Slope-G2G 25 \n33 \nsimulations and even fewer for the Soil-G2G. Most of the areas of high projected 1 \nincreases are located in Scotland or Northern England where the lack of an explicit 2 \nsnowmelt model may have led to some underestimation of Current flow peaks. This 3 \nmay have exaggerated the potential change in future flows as snowmelt events are 4 \nexpected to be less influential in a future warmer climate. 5 \n 6 \nMaps of differences in percentage change between the two model variants (Soil-G2G 7 \n\u2013 Slope-G2G), shown in the third row of Fig. 7, highlight that the largest areas of 8 \ndifference are in regions where slopes are lower and soils are particularly deep or 9 \nshallow. Upland areas tend to be shaded in green which indicates very little difference 10 \nbetween the models. Purple shading highlights areas where the Slope-G2G predicts a 11 \nlarger increase (or very occasionally a smaller decrease) than the Soil-G2G, and can 12 \ncoincide for example with regions of chalk or limestone geology. Orange areas are 13 \nonly apparent at higher return periods and tend to correspond to shallow soils in 14 \nlowland regions for which the Soil-G2G predicts larger increases (or smaller 15 \ndecreases) than the Slope-G2G.  16 \n 17 \nThe G2G model assessment against river flow observations indicates that the Soil-18 \nG2G generally provides a more reliable flow simulation over low relief areas than the 19 \nSlope-G2G, and also performs well over upland areas. The climate change impact 20 \nresults from this model might therefore be examined with greater confidence than 21 \nthose of the Slope-G2G. It is apparent from the maps in Fig. 7 obtained using the Soil-22 \nG2G model that the percentage change in future peak flows can vary between -60% 23 \nand 100%. This is a very large range and it is worth considering some of the factors 24 \nthat are likely to be contributing to this degree of variability.  25 \n34 \n 1 \nThe maps of modelled changes in flood magnitude indicate decreases in some parts of 2 \nSouth East England and the Midlands, particularly in areas overlying deeper soils and 3 \nchalk bedrock. Clay soils can be relatively deep (although a shallow gleyed layer is 4 \noften present), and while chalk soils are often quite thin, storage in areas underlain by 5 \nchalk has been augmented in the Soil-G2G by increasing the soil depth. Conceptually 6 \nthis has the effect of introducing a deep unsaturated storage zone beneath the soil 7 \nlayer. A water balance analysis indicates that while the volumes of actual evaporation 8 \nand total runoff are very similar for grid-cells in chalk and clay areas, the main 9 \ndifference between the two types of grid-cell is the time of release and partitioning of 10 \nrunoff between surface and sub-surface stores. In the G2G, areas with deeper stores 11 \nrespond more slowly to rainfall and evaporation than those with shallower ones such 12 \nas clay because the release of water from the soil\/unsaturated zone is determined by 13 \nthe relative saturation of the whole soil column. Areas with a deep soil\/unsaturated 14 \nlayer (up to 3 m) seldom become completely saturated, resulting in slow release of 15 \nwater over several months. Under a future climate scenario of warmer drier summers 16 \nand wetter winters, slowly-responding areas, such as chalk, are likely to \u201cremember\u201d 17 \nthe effects of a warm dry summer for many months as sub-surface storage and release 18 \nis reduced. Chalk areas tend not to respond immediately to intense autumn\/winter 19 \nrainfall with high flows, but will instead replenish their stores. Projected increases in 20 \nfuture evaporation may well extend the length of the autumn\/winter period during 21 \nwhich deep stores are replenished to field capacity. Catchments with shallower soils, 22 \nsuch as upland, urban and clay areas, tend to respond immediately to high 23 \nautumn\/winter rainfall with high river flows, resulting in projected increases in future 24 \nflow peaks. The ability of the Soil-G2G to reproduce these process-based mechanisms 25 \n35 \nusing historical observations gives greater weight to the model\u2019s projections of future 1 \nchange. The poorer performance of the Slope-G2G in simulating the timing and 2 \nrelease of runoff in low-relief areas accounts for the difference in the two models\u2019 3 \nprojections of peak flows in these areas. However, in higher-relief areas such as North 4 \nand West Britain, both models can realistically simulate the hydrological response of 5 \ncatchments to rainfall, resulting in more-accurate simulation of observed flows and 6 \nreasonable agreement on the likely effect of a future climate scenario on peak flows.  7 \n 8 \nOne of the most important factors influencing high river flows is rainfall. In the 9 \nHadRM3H climate projections there are increases in rainfall across the UK in 10 \nautumn\/winter rainfall (which most influences peak flows in Britain (Bayliss and 11 \nJones, 1993)) of up to 30% across with significant regional differences. For England 12 \nthere are projected increases of up to 30% in winter rainfall, in Wales and Cornwall 13 \nthe projected increase is 10 to 20% and Northwest Scotland less than 10%. Fig. 7 14 \nindicates that the response to this projected climate change in Wales and Cornwall is 15 \nan increase in peak flows, particularly at lower return periods, whilst in Western 16 \nScotland it is a decrease of up to 30%. This decrease is most likely to have arisen 17 \nthrough a combination of a projected increase in future summer PE of up to 30%, and 18 \na decrease of up to 20% in future autumn rainfall with only a small increase in winter 19 \nrainfall. 20 \n 21 \nIt is worth noting that saturation-excess runoff in soils is not the only mechanism 22 \nleading to high river flows in the UK, although it is a key factor. Infiltration-capacity 23 \nexcess runoff occurs when intense rainfall exceeds the infiltration-capacity of the soil 24 \nand can result in peak flows any time of the year, but particularly in summer months 25 \n36 \nduring localised convective storms. Infiltration-excess runoff is not included in the 1 \nG2G formulations presented here, but further work might consider the effect of 2 \nextremely intense rainfall on different types of soil and terrain. Extreme rainfall 3 \nevents caused by localised convection are not simulated by the 25 km resolution RCM 4 \nand thus their effect on projected peak flows across the UK is uncertain. 5 \n 6 \nIt is important to note that some of the spatial variation in hydrological response could 7 \narise from \u201cnoise\u201d in the RCM estimates of precipitation and PE used as input to the 8 \nG2G hydrological model. When Bell et al. (2007b) used the same RCM to estimate 9 \nthe impact of climate change on flows in 25 catchments across the UK they noted that 10 \nthe rainfall simulated by the RCM over the first half of the Current period was 11 \naffected by an unusually heavy rainfall event over southern England. The effect of 12 \none extreme rainfall event in the Current precipitation series was to raise the estimated 13 \npeak flows for some catchments for high return periods. As the Future flow series did 14 \nnot contain a comparable flow peak, this significantly affected comparison of the 15 \nflood frequency curves derived from the Current and Future flow simulations; 16 \nremoving the highest peak from the flood frequency analysis even resulted in changes 17 \nof the opposite sign in some catchments. In order to investigate the robustness of the 18 \nmodelled changes in flood frequency here, particularly given the extreme rainfall 19 \nevent in the Current period for some areas, the resampling method followed by Bell et 20 \nal. (2007b) was applied, on a point-by-point basis. That is, for each river point the 21 \nAM series were resampled for both Current and Future periods with new flood 22 \nfrequency curves fitted to each resample. Specifically, the resampling at each location 23 \nwas undertaken 100,000 times with replacement, so that any one resampled series 24 \ncould contain some repeated AM and some absent. Percentage changes were then 25 \n37 \ncalculated between the new pairs of Current and Future curves at several return 1 \nperiods, and counts made of the number of pairs with changes of the same sign as the 2 \noriginal. 3 \n 4 \nThe results are summarised in the set of maps in Fig. 8, which highlight areas for 5 \nwhich most of the resamples keep the same direction of change in the future (increase 6 \nor decrease in peak flows). More specifically, dark blue areas indicate areas for which 7 \nmore than 90% of the resampled AM series continue to show an increase in peak 8 \nflows; dark red areas indicate areas where more than 90% show a decrease, and green 9 \nand orange are the same as for blue and red respectively, but with only between 70% 10 \nand 90% of the resamples in agreement. The maps indicate that, for both model 11 \nformulations, changes at higher return periods are, unsurprisingly, generally less 12 \nrobust than those at lower return periods. However, this is particularly true for the 13 \nSlope-G2G and over regions of south and east England, which were especially 14 \naffected by the extreme rainfall event in the Current Period. For both G2G model 15 \nvariants, areas of change that are most robust are the wetter parts of the UK such as 16 \nthe north and west, perhaps because the AM are less variable in the wettest pasts of 17 \nthe country. Overall, the Soil-G2G is slightly more robust than the Slope-G2G, but the 18 \nmain differences between them lie in lowland areas such a South East England, for 19 \nwhich the Soil-G2G is more realistic. In particular, at the 2-year return period the 20 \nSlope-G2G indicates robust increases in many parts of South East England, but using 21 \nthe Soil-G2G some of these areas (such as those over chalk) instead show robust 22 \ndecreases. This highlights an important point that a \u201crobust\u201d model is not necessarily 23 \n\u201ccorrect\u201d, as robustness here tests only the homogeneity of the modelled flows, not 24 \nthe skill of the model to reproduce physical processes. 25 \n38 \n 1 \nThe robustness analysis has been repeated following removal of the highest peak from 2 \neach AM series. The results shown in Fig. 9 indicate that, following removal of the 3 \nhighest peak, the sign of the percentage change in flood magnitude is robust for a 4 \nlarger area of the UK than shown in Fig. 8, with a particular difference for higher 5 \nreturn periods and over South East England \u2013 the area affected by the extreme event 6 \nin the Current period. These results highlight the importance of not giving too much 7 \nweight to results obtained from just one Current and Future RCM scenario. 8 \n 9 \nIn terms of the modelled percentage changes in flood peaks between the Current and 10 \nFuture period, removal of the highest flow peak from the AM series and a subsequent 11 \nrecalculation of the flood frequency curves has a lesser effect on the Soil-G2G than 12 \nthe Slope-G2G, where it led to lower estimates of future decreases in flood magnitude 13 \nin South East England. Performance of the Slope-G2G in low relief areas (such as the 14 \nSouth East) is generally poorer than in upland areas and there is less confidence in 15 \nprojected change in this region. 16 \n 17 \n 18 \nSummary and discussion 19 \n 20 \nA Grid-to-Grid (G2G) model has been calibrated to, and evaluated against, historical 21 \nriver flow data for catchments across Britain in order to obtain optimal model 22 \nperformance at a spatial resolution of 1km and a temporal resolution of one day (or 23 \nless). Two formulations of the G2G are assessed using observations of rainfall, 24 \npotential evaporation and daily mean river flow. Both model formulations are 25 \n39 \nconstrained to employ just one set of calibrated parameters for the whole of the UK 1 \nand rely on digital datasets to provide spatially variable information on hydrological 2 \nresponse. The Slope-G2G formulation performs well for catchments where runoff-3 \ngeneration is controlled by slope\/topography, but is less effective where soil\/geology 4 \nis the dominant influence. The Soil-G2G model benefits from additional hydrological 5 \ninformation contained in soil datasets and consequently simulates river flows 6 \nreasonably well for a wide range of catchments, and very well for many catchments 7 \nhaving a natural flow regime and for which the flow record is believed to be accurate.  8 \n 9 \nUse of the grid-based methodology in conjunction with high resolution climate model 10 \noutput has made it possible here, for the first time, to estimate the spatial effects of 11 \nclimate change on peak river flows across the UK. The observations of rainfall and 12 \npotential evaporation used to calibrate and assess both hydrological models were 13 \nreplaced by RCM estimates on a 25 km grid and at hourly intervals for a Current 14 \n(1960 to 1990) and a Future (2070 to 2100) time-slice. Flood frequency curves were 15 \nderived from the flow simulations obtained using the Current and Future precipitation 16 \nestimates, and maps of estimated changes in flood magnitude for river points on a 1 17 \nkm grid across the UK presented. These maps suggest a high degree of spatial 18 \nvariability in the sensitivity of UK rivers to future changes in climate, with the 19 \nmodelled percentage changes in future peak flows varying between -60% and 100% 20 \n(sometimes outside of this range for the Slope-G2G). Climate change is only one 21 \nfactor responsible for these patterns of differences, with both landscape and internal 22 \nclimate variability being important factors. The very large range needs careful 23 \ninterpretation before clear messages about impacts of climate change on peak river 24 \nflows can be drawn. It is important to recognise that in undertaking a hydrological 25 \n40 \nimpact analysis such as the one presented here, we assume that a model tested for 1 \ncurrent weather conditions will also apply under conditions associated with projected 2 \nclimate change. This reservation applies to almost any model used for climate change 3 \nimpact assessments, and we feel is most likely to be overcome with a process-based 4 \nmodel, such as the Soil-G2G, tested over as wide a range of conditions as possible. 5 \nThis approach is also likely to lead to fewer problems related to over-calibration to 6 \ncurrent conditions and extrapolation than a catchment model which might only have 7 \nbeen assessed on a small number of catchments. 8 \n 9 \nThe use of two different G2G model formulations allows us to assess the sensitivity of 10 \na climate impact flood risk assessment to hydrological model structure. Similarities 11 \nbetween the results from both models are apparent, particularly in high relief areas 12 \nsuch as the North and West of Britain. In South East England and the Midlands there 13 \nis more spatial and inter-model variation in the estimated impact of climate change on 14 \nriver flows. These regions tend to have lower relief and spatially variable soil\/geology 15 \nand include areas where groundwater is a significant component of river flow. 16 \nAnalysis of the results in different regions highlights how the impact of climate 17 \nchange on river flows is likely to arise from a subtle combination of both local factors 18 \nsuch as soil and relief, and a larger-scale fine balance between future seasonal change 19 \nin rainfall and evaporation. Potential evaporation has been calculated here using a 20 \nprocedure as consistent as possible with a Penman-Monteith estimate. However, other 21 \nmethods of estimating PE are available and use of these could lead to different climate 22 \nchange impacts. Kay and Davies (2008), for example, obtain results that suggest a 23 \nsimple temperature-based estimator of PE may have benefit when calculated from 24 \nclimate model predicted variables. This may reflect the higher relative skill of climate 25 \n41 \nmodels to predict temperature than other variables involved in the calculation of 1 \nPenman-Monteith PE. Johnson and Sharma (2009) present climate model prediction 2 \nresults that ranks surface air temperature as second highest only to pressure in skill. 3 \nRain rate is ranked least skilful of the eight climate variables assessed. This 4 \nuncertainty presents a well known challenge for climate modellers that is being 5 \naddressed here through the use of a high-resolution RCM, and through ensembles in 6 \nother work. Maps of percentage change in HadRM3H Penman-Monteith PE (not 7 \nshown) indicate a future increase across the whole of the UK, with the greatest 8 \nincrease occurring in the South. However, any future increase in carbon dioxide might 9 \ninstead lead to a decrease in plant transpiration and a greater propensity for high river 10 \nflows (Gedney et al., 2006), a factor which has not been included in the analysis 11 \npresented here. 12 \n 13 \nAn analysis of the robustness of the sign of the changes in flood magnitude indicated 14 \nthat, for both G2G model formulations, areas of change that are most robust are the 15 \nwetter parts of the UK such as the north and west, perhaps because the annual maxima 16 \nare less variable here. Also, larger areas of robust peak flow changes are seen using 17 \nthe Soil-G2G with the main differences between the two models occurring in lowland 18 \nareas such as South East England. Here the simulation-performance of the Soil-G2G 19 \nis more realistic and thus these results are likely to be more reliable.  20 \n 21 \nResults in the South East were also skewed by the presence of an extreme rainfall 22 \nevent in the Current period, highlighting the importance of not giving too much 23 \nweight to results obtained from a single 30-year sample of a Current and Future 24 \nclimate period. Ideally using an ensemble approach to fully sample the climatologies 25 \n42 \nof the two periods (Kendon et al, 2008) would be applied. Possible alternatives when 1 \nmodelling individual catchments could be to apply a weather generator (e.g. Kilsby et 2 \nal., 2007) or to resample the available rainfall inputs a large number of times (e.g. 3 \nKay et al., 2009), but the need here for spatially-consistent rainfall across the UK 4 \ncurrently precludes the use of the former, and the fact that the G2G currently takes 3 5 \nweeks to run for a 30-year time-slice on a 1km grid across the UK precludes the latter. 6 \n 7 \nThe use of two different model variants employing the same climate model estimates 8 \nof precipitation and PE as input has highlighted the importance of using the most 9 \naccurate, physically representative model as possible for climate impact assessments. 10 \nDifferent hydrological models can respond in unexpected ways to subtle changes in 11 \nthe climate model estimates used as input. The results presented here indicate that the 12 \neffect of projected climate change on UK catchments is sensitive not only to changes 13 \nin the precipitation and PE data used as input, but to the model representations used to 14 \ncapture \u201ctraditional\u201d hydrological responses. Future research will therefore aim to 15 \nimprove process-representation in the G2G model in order to increase confidence in 16 \nsimulated projected changes in peak river flows. Snowmelt, for example, is an 17 \nimportant influence on river flows which is not currently included in the G2G, and the 18 \nlack of a snowmelt representation is likely to have led to an exaggeration in the 19 \nestimated impact of climate change on river flows in upland areas. Similarly, 20 \nprocesses such as flood-plain storage and attenuation which influence the occurrence 21 \nof flood inundation are not currently included. Flood-plain storage has the effect of 22 \nreducing the intensity of high river flows, and large percentage changes in estimated 23 \nfuture peak flows would in practice be reduced if current levels of available storage 24 \nare maintained. The maps of changing flood risk presented here reveal the spatial 25 \n43 \ncomplexity of the response of UK catchments to one particular projected climate 1 \nchange. However, to support flood management and policy decisions concerning key 2 \ncatchments, a more comprehensive analysis is needed taking into account relevant 3 \nhydrological processes and embracing consideration of catchment conditions, multiple 4 \nclimate scenarios and climate model structure at different scales.  5 \n 6 \n 7 \nAcknowledgements 8 \n 9 \nThis research was funded via the UK Met Office Hadley Centre by the Joint 10 \nDepartment of Energy and Climate Change and Ministry of Defence Integrated 11 \nClimate Programme: (DECC) GA01101 (MoD) CBC\/2B\/0417_Annex C5.
