We reconsider the example of the\nprocess gg \u2192 tt\u00af and show that the factorization problem can be completely\nresolved. A natural interpretation of the seemingly non-factorizing terms\nis found, and they are rewritten in a systematic and factorized form. The\nkey to the solution is that the D- and (4 \u2212 D)-dimensional parts of the\n4-dimensional gluon have to be regarded as independent partons.\n1 Introduction\nNearly 20 years ago, Ref. [1] observed a problem concerning factorization in con-\njunction with regularization by dimensional reduction (dred) [2]. The partonic\nprocess gg \u2192 tt\u00af with non-vanishing quark mass mt \u2261 m was evaluated using\nboth dred and ordinary dimensional regularization (dreg) [3]2. Contrary to\nexpectations [4], the difference between the two regularization schemes could not\nbe absorbed by a finite additional factorization, corresponding to a change in the\nparton distribution functions.\n1email: {Adrian.Signer, Dominik.Stockinger}@durham.ac.uk\n2Sometimes, these regularization schemes are also abbreviated as \u201cDR\u201d and \u201cCDR (conven-\ntional dimensional regularization)\u201d.\n1\nAs a consequence it seems impossible to write the hadronic cross section \u03c3had\nas a convolution of parton distribution functions f and the partonic cross section\n\u03c3DREDparton. Schematically, the factorization problem can be expressed as\n\u03c3had = f \u2297 \u03c3\nDRED\nparton + extra, non-factorizing terms. (1)\nThe extra terms vanish in the limit of vanishing quark mass m = 0. Moreover,\nin the case of only massless partons the transition between the two regulariza-\ntion schemes has been worked out for many examples [5, 6] and could always be\nperformed as expected. Even for one-loop amplitudes involving massive partons\nthe transition could be studied [7]. Nevertheless, the problem found in Ref. [1]\nfor the massive case has remained unsolved. It has repeatedly shown up and has\nbeen stressed again e.g. in Refs. [8, 9].\nThere are two areas where dred is traditionally applied with great benefit.\nOne is the evaluation of purely massless amplitudes, especially within QCD. Here\ndred and related methods allow the use of powerful helicity methods [10]. The\nmost important application of dred and its original purpose is the regulariza-\ntion of supersymmetric theories. It has been shown to preserve supersymme-\ntry relations in many different cases at the one-loop [8, 11, 12] and the two-loop\nlevel [13,14], and in [13] also further properties such as mathematical consistency\nhave been established.\nThe factorization problem is particularly troublesome for the calculation of\nQCD corrections to supersymmetric processes involving hadrons. In spite of\nthe advantages of dred, it renders the use of dred questionable (see e.g. the\ndiscussion in [8]). Resorting to dreg in such calculations introduces several dis-\nadvantages. Mainly, supersymmetry is broken and has to be restored by adding\nsupersymmetry-restoring counterterms [8, 12] that do not correspond to multi-\nplicative renormalization. In addition, the DR renormalization scheme, a very\ncommon definition of supersymmetry parameters, is naturally based on dred but\nonly awkward to realize using dreg. Clearly, a resolution of the factorization\nproblem would be welcome for both fundamental and practical reasons [15, 16].\nIn this article we reconsider the problem found in Refs. [1, 9]. We show that,\ndespite first appearances, the result of Ref. [1] in fact is perfectly consistent with\nfactorization.\nWe begin in Sec. 2 with a detailed explanation of the calculation of the LO\nprocess gg \u2192 tt\u00af and the real NLO correction gg \u2192 tt\u00afg. We consider the collinear\nlimit of two of the gluons and recover the seemingly paradoxical result of Ref. [1].\nAn important ingredient of this collinear limit is the necessity to average over\nthe unobservable azimuthal angle of the final state gluon. It distinguishes the\nmassive from the massless case, and in the massive case it leads to the difference\nbetween the dreg- and the dred-result.\nIn Sec. 3 we first describe the general idea that will lead to a re-interpretation\nof the result, showing that it is consistent with factorization. The crucial point\n2\nto notice is that in dred the 4-dimensional gluon is a composition of a D-\ndimensional part and a remaining (4\u2212D)-dimensional part, and that these two\nparts behave as two different partons g and \u03c6.\nFinally it is demonstrated in detail how this idea leads to a resolution of\nthe factorization problem. On the one hand, in the collinear limit the NLO\ncross section becomes equal to a linear combination of two different LO cross\nsections, with either g or \u03c6 in the initial state. On the other hand, the appearing\nprefactors in this linear combination have a natural interpretation as splitting\nfunctions for the splitting processes g \u2192 gg, \u03c6 \u2192 g\u03c6, etc. We will also explain\nwhy factorization works in them = 0 case already without distinguishing between\ng and \u03c6.\nIn Sec. 4 we give our conclusions.\n2 Recovering the seemingly non-factorizing re-\nsult\n2.1 LO and NLO calculation\nWe consider hadroproduction of a quark pair tt\u00af via gluon fusion, the process for\nwhich the factorization problem has been reported in Refs. [1, 9]. In this section\nwe will briefly describe the required tree-level calculations and recover the result\nof these references. At leading order (LO) we only need the 2 \u2192 2 process\ngg \u2192 tt\u00af, whereas at next-to-leading order (NLO) we also have to consider the\n2\u2192 3 process with an additional gluon in the final state.\nWe carry out the calculation using either dreg or dred. In both cases,\nspace-time, momenta and momentum integrals are treated in D dimensions. In\ndreg, the gluon vector field is treated in D dimensions as well, while in dred\nthe gluon field and \u03b3-matrices remain 4-dimensional quantities.\nAt leading order the amplitude ARS(2\u21922) is given by the diagrams sketched\nin Fig. 1a. The subscript RS denotes the regularization scheme, dreg or dred.\nThe incoming gluon momenta and colour indices are denoted by k1,2 and a1,2,\nrespectively; the outgoing momenta are called p1,2. We will use the kinematical\nvariables\nS = 2k1k2, T1 = (k1 \u2212 p1)\n2 \u2212m2, U1 = (k2 \u2212 p1)\n2 \u2212m2. (2)\nARS(2\u21922) can be decomposed into two colour structures as\nARS(2\u21922) = A\n(12)\nRS (2\u21922)T\na1T a2 +A\n(21)\nRS (2\u21922)T\na2T a1 . (3)\nThe squared LO amplitude, summed over initial and final state polarizations and\n3\ncolours, can be decomposed as\nMRS(2\u21922) =\n\u2211\npols,col\n|ARS(2\u21922)|\n2\n=\n(N2 \u2212 1)2\n4N\nM\n(1)\nRS(2\u21922)\u2212\nN2 \u2212 1\n4N\nM\n(2)\nRS(2\u21922), (4)\nwhere N = 3 is the number of colours. For the polarization sum corresponding\nto a gluon with polarization vector \u01eb\u00b5 and momentum k, we use\n\u2211\npols\n\u01eb\u00b5\u01eb\u03bd\u2217 \u2192 \u2212g\u00b5\u03bd +\nn\u00b5k\u03bd + k\u00b5n\u03bd\n(nk)\n\u2212\nn2k\u00b5k\u03bd\n(nk)2\n(5)\nwith an arbitrary gauge vector n\u00b5 such that nk 6= 0.\nWe obtain the following results:\nM\n(1,2)\nRS (2\u21922) = 8g\n4\n{\n1\u2212\n2T1U1\nS2\n, +\n2T1U1\nS2\n}\nBQED, (6a)\nBQED = n\nRS\nG\n(\n\u22121 +\nnRSG S\n2\n4T1U1\n)\n+\n4m2S\nT 21U\n2\n1\n(\nT1U1 \u2212m\n2S\n)\n, (6b)\nin agreement with Ref. [1]. The difference between the calculation in dred and\ndreg enters only through the number nRSG of gluon degrees of freedom,\nnDREGG = D \u2212 2, n\nDRED\nG = 2. (7)\nTechnically, nRSG appears in the form n\nRS\nG = g\n\u00b5\n\u00b5 \u2212 2, where the metric tensor\noriginates either from the numerator of a gluon propagator or the polarization\nsum (5).\nAt NLO, we restrict ourselves to the real corrections, corresponding to the\nprocess gg \u2192 tt\u00afg. This is sufficient for the discussion of the collinear divergences\nand the factorization problem [1,9]. The diagrams contributing to the amplitude\nA(2\u21923) are generically depicted in Fig. 1b. The outgoing momentum and colour\nindices of the additional final state gluon are denoted by k3, a3; in accordance\nwith Ref. [1] we use the kinematical variables\ns = (k1 + k2)\n2, s4 = (k3 + p1)\n2 \u2212m2, t\u2032 = (k2 \u2212 k3)\n2,\nu\u2032 = (k1 \u2212 k3)\n2, u6 = (k2 \u2212 p1)\n2 \u2212m2, u7 = (k1 \u2212 p1)\n2 \u2212m2,\n(8)\nwhich satisfy s + s4 + t\n\u2032 + u\u2032 + u6 + u7 = 0. It is useful to keep the distinction\nbetween these variables for the 2\u2192 3 process and the variables S, T1, U1 for the\n2\u2192 2 process although S and s are the same functions of k1,2. The explicit form\nof the full result for MRS(2\u21923) is lengthy and suppressed here.\n4\nk1\nk2\np1\np2\nk1\nk2\np1\np2\nk3\nk1\nk2\nk3\np1\np2\nFigure 1: Generic structure of (a) LO diagrams, (b) NLO real correction dia-\ngrams, (c) NLO diagrams giving rise to a collinear divergence for k3 \u2192 (1\u2212x)k2.\nIn order to obtain the partonic cross sections, the squared amplitudes have to\nbe averaged over the initial state polarizations and colours and divided by a flux\nfactor. We denote these averaged quantities by\n\u3008MRS(2\u21922)\u3009 =\n1\n2S\n1\n[nRSG (N\n2 \u2212 1)]2\nMRS(2\u21922), (9a)\n\u3008MRS(2\u21923)\u3009 =\n1\n2s\n1\n[nRSG (N\n2 \u2212 1)]2\nMRS(2\u21923). (9b)\nThe differential cross sections are then given by (P \u2261 k1 + k2 \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2)\nd\u03c3RS2\u21922 = \u3008MRS(2\u21922)\u3009\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed \u220f\npf=p1,2\ndD\u22121pf\n2p0f(2\u03c0)\n3\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (2\u03c0)D\u03b4(D) (P ) , (10)\nd\u03c3RS2\u21923 = \u3008MRS(2\u21923)\u3009\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed \u220f\npf=p1,2,k3\ndD\u22121pf\n2p0f(2\u03c0)\n3\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (2\u03c0)D\u03b4(D) (P \u2212 k3) . (11)\nThey depend on the regularization scheme at O(4\u2212D) and at O((4\u2212D)0) due\nto soft and collinear divergences.\n2.2 Collinear limit and azimuthal average\nNow we consider the limit of \u3008MRS(2\u21923)\u3009, where the unobserved final state gluon\nbecomes collinear to one of the initial state gluons. To be specific we will con-\ncentrate on the collinear limit 2\u20163 of gluon 2 and gluon 3 and define the collinear\nlimit k\u22a5 \u2192 0 by parametrizing the momenta k\n\u00b5\n2 and k\n\u00b5\n3 as follows:\nk\u00b53 = (1\u2212 x)k\n\u00b5\n2 + k\n\u00b5\n\u22a5 \u2212\nk2\u22a5\n1\u2212 x\nn\u00b5\n2k2n\n, (12)\nwhere the auxiliary vector n\u00b5 satisfies n2 = nk\u22a5 = 0.\nThe collinear divergence in the NLO cross section originates from diagrams\nof the form shown in Fig. 1c where the virtual gluon becomes on-shell. In the\n5\nsquared amplitude this gives rise to terms of the order 1\/t\u2032 \u223c 1\/k2\u22a5, and such\nterms lead to singularities in the phase-space integral. As can be read off from\nFig. 1c, one would expect the divergent NLO terms to become proportional to\nthe LO terms with the identification\nS \u2192 xs, U1 \u2192 xu6, T1 \u2192 \u2212x(s + u6). (13)\nHowever, this naive expectation does not take into account the following sub-\ntlety: not all poles 1\/k2\u22a5 of the squared amplitude are directly of the form 1\/t\n\u2032.\nSome poles have a more involved structure. In particular, in our example, there\nare poles of the form (ss4 \u2212 u\n\u2032u6)\n2\/t\u20322. Upon taking the collinear limit, these\nterms depend on k\u00b5\u22a5. However, the transverse direction k\n\u00b5\n\u22a5 is unobservable in\nthe collinear limit and will be azimuthally averaged over in the phase-space in-\ntegral [6]. This averaging procedure affects only terms containing 1\/t\u20322, and it\nyields\n(ss4 \u2212 u\n\u2032u6)\n2\nt\u20322\n\u30082\u20163\u3009\n\u2212\u2192\n1\nD \u2212 2\n\u2212(1\u2212 x)\nx2\n4S (T1U1 \u2212m\n2S)\nt\u2032\n+ . . . , (14)\nwhere the dots denote terms without a 1\/t\u2032 singularity. The notation \u30082\u20163\u3009 implies\nthat the average over the (D \u2212 2)-dimensional transverse space is taken in the\ncollinear limit. The factor (D \u2212 2) enters the denominator as a result of this\naveraging [6].\nTaking the averaged collinear limit of \u3008MRS(2\u21923)\u3009 we obtain\n\u3008MRS(2\u21923)\u3009\n\u30082\u20163\u3009\n\u2212\u2192\n\u22124g2N\nt\u2032\n(\n(1\u2212 x+ x2)2\nx(1\u2212 x)\n\u3008MRS(2\u21922)\u3009\n+\n( nRSG\nD \u2212 2\n\u2212 1\n)(1\u2212 x)\nx\n\u3008MRS(2\u21922)\u3009|m\n)\n, (15)\nwhere MRS(2\u21922)|m \u2261 MRS(2\u21922) \u2212 MRS(2\u21922)|m=0 denotes the mass terms of\nMRS(2\u21922). This equation is equivalent to the result found in Refs. [1, 9].\nThe factorization theorem seems to suggest that the terms that are divergent\nin this collinear limit are proportional to the LO result. Whereas the first term on\nthe right-hand side of (15) is in accordance with this expectation, the second term\ncontains only the mass-dependent terms of the LO result and, therefore, seems to\nviolate the factorization theorem. Due to the prefactor, this second term is absent\nin dreg, and the problem is only present in dred. What we would expect in\ngoing from dreg, where factorization holds, to dred is a change in the function\nmultiplying the LO term, but not a change in the structure of the result.\nAs mentioned in Ref. [1, 9] the problematic term vanishes in the massless\nlimit. However, this is not generally true but is peculiar to the process under\nconsideration. The decisive feature is not the mass of the quarks but the presence\n6\nof terms \u223c 1\/t\u20322. In our case, the absence of 1\/t\u20322 terms in the massless case can\nbe explained by helicity conservation.\nIn the next section we will discuss the origin of the seemingly non-factorizing\nterm and show that it can be rewritten in a way that is consistent with factor-\nization.\n3 Reconciling the NLO result with factorization\n3.1 General idea\nIn the collinear limit, the NLO result in dred (15) does not seem to factorize into\na product of a splitting function and the LO result. In contrast, the NLO result in\ndreg does factorize. There is a simple argument that allows to understand why\nthe two regularization schemes behave in such a different way. In the regularized\nexpressions, the number of dimensions D and of gluon degrees of freedom nRSG can\nbe set to integers. For example, dreg with integer D and nDREGG = D\u2212 2 simply\ncorresponds to unregularized QCD in D dimensions. Of course, factorization can\nbe expected to hold in QCD with an arbitrary number of dimensions. This is the\nreason why Eq. (15) factorizes in the case of dreg.\nIn contrast, dred with e.g. D = 3 does not lead to 3-dimensional QCD but\nrather to 4-dimensional QCD, dimensionally reduced to 3 dimensions. It is well\nknown that in the process of dimensional reduction from 4 to 3 dimensions, the\n4-dimensional gluon is decomposed into the 3-dimensional gluon A\u00b5 (\u00b5 = 0, 1, 2)\nand an extra scalar field \u03c6 \u2261 A3. The resulting theory is 3-dimensional QCD,\nsupplemented with a minimally coupled scalar \u03c6 in the adjoint representation.\nThe crucial point to be learnt from this discussion is that the dimension-\nally reduced theory contains two distinct partons, the 3-dimensional gluon g and\nthe scalar \u03c6. At LO there are therefore four distinct partonic processes for tt\u00af\nproduction:\ngg \u2192 tt\u00af, g\u03c6\u2192 tt\u00af, \u03c6g \u2192 tt\u00af, \u03c6\u03c6\u2192 tt\u00af. (16)\nIt is obvious that factorization can be expected to hold in this dimensionally\nreduced theory, but not in the same way as in dreg. On the right-hand side of\nEq. (15) we do not expect one single term but instead a linear combination of all\nfour partonic LO processes.\nIn dred with arbitrary, non-integer D, the situation is similar. The regular-\nized theory contains a D-dimensional gluon g and 4\u2212D additional scalar fields \u03c6,\nso-called \u01eb-scalars [11]. Again, g and \u03c6 have to be viewed as independent partons,\nand the collinear limit is expected to contain all four LO processes.\nIn order to express this new expectation more formally, we denote the 4-\ndimensional gluon that has always been assumed in dred in the previous section\n7\n(and also in Refs. [1,9]) by G. The 2\u2192 2 and 2\u2192 3 processes considered in the\nprevious section can then be written more explicitly as\nM\nDRED\n(2\u21922(3)) \u2261M\nDRED\n(GG\u2192tt\u00af(G)). (17)\nSince the 4-dimensional gluon G constitutes the combination g + \u03c6, the squared\nmatrix elements satisfy the relation\nM\nDRED\n(GG\u2192tt\u00af) =M\nDRED\n(gg\u2192tt\u00af) +M\nDRED\n(g\u03c6\u2192tt\u00af)\n+M\nDRED\n(\u03c6g\u2192tt\u00af) +M\nDRED\n(\u03c6\u03c6\u2192tt\u00af) (18)\nand similarly forM\nDRED\n(GG\u2192tt\u00afG). This leads us to expect that the collinear limit\nin dred can be written as\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(ij\u2192tt\u00afk)\u3009\n\u30082\u20163\u3009\n\u2212\u2192\n\u22122g2\nt\u2032\n[ \u2211\nl=g,\u03c6\nPj\u2192lk\u3008MDRED(il\u2192tt\u00af)\u3009\n]\n. (19)\nContrary to the corresponding formula for dreg, the right-hand side of Eq. (19)\nis a linear combination involving more than one LO process.\nIn the following we will show that the seemingly non-factorizing term in\nEq. (15) can be rewritten as a linear combination of the four partonic LO pro-\ncesses. Thus, factorization is valid in dred in the form expected in Eq. (19) and\nwe will see that the functions Pj\u2192lk can be interpreted as splitting functions.\n3.2 Collinear limit and LO result with g or \u03c6 in the initial\nstate\nAccording to the idea discussed in the preceding subsection we evaluate all four\npartonic LO processes (16) individually. The algebraic expressions for the par-\ntonic processes involving g, \u03c6, or G are distinguished by the values of the polar-\nization vector \u01eb\u00b5 and the corresponding polarization sum. The polarization sum\ncorresponding to an external G is the one given in Eq. (5); the ones corresponding\nto g and \u03c6 read\ng :\n\u2211\npols\n\u01eb\u00b5\u01eb\u03bd\u2217 \u2192 \u2212g\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd +\nn\u00b5k\u03bd + k\u00b5n\u03bd\n(nk)\n\u2212\nn2k\u00b5k\u03bd\n(nk)2\n, (20a)\n\u03c6 :\n\u2211\npols\n\u01eb\u00b5\u01eb\u03bd\u2217 \u2192 \u2212g\u02dc\u00b5\u03bd . (20b)\nThe objects g\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd and g\u02dc\u00b5\u03bd are the projectors on the D- and (4 \u2212 D)-dimensional\nsubspaces [2] (see also Ref. [13] for further details) and satisfy g\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd g\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd = D,\ng\u02dc\u00b5\u03bd g\u02dc\u00b5\u03bd = 4\u2212D and the projector relations g\n\u00b5\u03bd g\u02c6\u03bd\n\u03c1 = g\u02c6\u00b5\u03c1, g\u00b5\u03bd g\u02dc\u03bd\n\u03c1 = g\u02dc\u00b5\u03c1. They are\nrelated to the 4-dimensional metric tensor by g\u00b5\u03bd = g\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd + g\u02dc\u00b5\u03bd .\n8\nWe obtain the following results:\nM\n(1,2)\nDRED(ij\u2192tt\u00af) = 8g\n4\n{\n1\u2212\n2T1U1\nS2\n, +\n2T1U1\nS2\n}\nBij, (21a)\nBgg = n\nDRED\ng\n(\n\u22121 +\nnDREDg S\n2\n4T1U1\n)\n+\n4m2S\nT 21U\n2\n1\n(\nT1U1 \u2212m\n2S\n)\n, (21b)\nB\u03c6\u03c6 = n\nDRED\n\u03c6\n(\n\u22121 +\nnDRED\u03c6 S\n2\n4T1U1\n)\n, (21c)\nBg\u03c6 = n\nDRED\ng n\nDRED\n\u03c6\nS2\n4T1U1\n, (21d)\nB\u03c6g = n\nDRED\ng n\nDRED\n\u03c6\nS2\n4T1U1\n. (21e)\nHere the symbols nDREDg and n\nDRED\n\u03c6 denote the numbers of degrees of freedom\ncorresponding to the partons g and \u03c6:\nnDREDg = D \u2212 2, n\nDRED\n\u03c6 = 4\u2212D. (22)\nThe fact that the 4-dimensional gluon G is the combination of g and \u03c6 is reflected\nin the equality nDREDG = n\nDRED\ng + n\nDRED\n\u03c6 and by the observation that, as already\nstated in Eq. (18), the sum of the four partial results (21) is equal to the result\nfor the GG initial state.\nNote that the result for the gg case is equal to the LO result in dreg because\neqs. (6b) and (21b) have the same form and nDREGG = n\nDRED\ng . This equality can\nbe understood as a consequence of the fact that in the simple process gg \u2192 tt\u00af at\ntree level no \u01eb-scalars \u03c6 appear as virtual states in the Feynman diagrams.\nIn a next step we perform the calculation of all eight squared amplitudes\nM\nDRED\n(ij\u2192tt\u00afk) with i, j, k = g, \u03c6. We do not present the full analytic results\nbut concentrate on the collinear limit k3 \u2192 (1\u2212 x)k2, since we are interested in\nhow the processes involving the individual partons g, \u03c6 behave as compared to\nthe seemingly non-factorizing result (15) for the process involving only G. The\naveraged amplitudes are defined as in Eq. (9), replacing nDREDG by n\nDRED\ng , n\nDRED\n\u03c6\nwhere appropriate. We find the following results:\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(ig\u2192tt\u00afg)\u3009\n\u30082\u20163\u3009\n\u2212\u2192\n\u22124g2N\nt\u2032\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(ig\u2192tt\u00af)\u3009\n(1\u2212 x+ x2)2\nx(1\u2212 x)\n, (23a)\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(i\u03c6\u2192tt\u00afg)\u3009\n\u30082\u20163\u3009\n\u2212\u2192\n\u22124g2N\nt\u2032\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(i\u03c6\u2192tt\u00af)\u3009\nx\n1\u2212 x\n, (23b)\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(ig\u2192tt\u00af\u03c6)\u3009\n\u30082\u20163\u3009\n\u2212\u2192\n\u22124g2N\nt\u2032\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(i\u03c6\u2192tt\u00af)\u3009\nnDRED\u03c6\nnDREDg\nx(1\u2212 x), (23c)\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(i\u03c6\u2192tt\u00af\u03c6)\u3009\n\u30082\u20163\u3009\n\u2212\u2192\n\u22124g2N\nt\u2032\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(ig\u2192tt\u00af)\u3009\n1\u2212 x\nx\n. (23d)\n9\nThese results have precisely the form of Eq. (19) with\nPg\u2192gg = 2N\n(1\u2212 x\u2212 x2)2\nx(1\u2212 x)\n, (24a)\nP\u03c6\u2192\u03c6g = 2N\nx\n1\u2212 x\n, (24b)\nPg\u2192\u03c6\u03c6 = 2N\nnDRED\u03c6\nnDREDg\nx(1\u2212 x), (24c)\nP\u03c6\u2192g\u03c6 = 2N\n1\u2212 x\nx\n, (24d)\nPj\u2192lk = 0 otherwise. (24e)\nThey demonstrate clearly that all eight individual partonic processes factorize in\nthe usual way into a product of a splitting function and a LO process, without any\nunusual terms. There are not even non-trivial linear combinations of LO processes\non the right-hand sides. This fact and the origin of the splitting functions is\ndiscussed in the following subsections.\nThe eight results can now be combined to reconcile the collinear limit in\nEq. (15) for dred with factorization. Instead of Eq. (15) we now obtain\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(GG\u2192tt\u00afG)\u3009 =\n\u2211\ni,j,k=g,\u03c6\nnDREDi n\nDRED\nj\n(nDREDG )\n2\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(ij\u2192tt\u00afk)\u3009\n\u30082\u20163\u3009\n\u2212\u2192\n\u22124g2N\nt\u2032\n[\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(Gg\u2192tt\u00af)\u3009\n(\nnDREDg\nnDREDG\n(1\u2212 x+ x2)2\nx(1\u2212 x)\n+\nnDRED\u03c6\nnDREDG\n1\u2212 x\nx\n)\n+\u3008M\nDRED\n(G\u03c6\u2192tt\u00af)\u3009\nnDRED\u03c6\nnDREDG\n(\nx\n1\u2212 x\n+ x(1\u2212 x)\n)]\n, (25)\nwhere the relations M(Gj\u2192tt\u00af) = M(gj\u2192tt\u00af) +M(\u03c6j\u2192tt\u00af) have been used. In this\nequation the collinear limit finally acquires a factorized structure although dred\nis used. As expected in Sec. 3.1, a linear combination of LO processes appears\non the right-hand side.\nIt is instructive to directly verify the equality of eqs. (25) and (15), the fac-\ntorized and non-factorized version of the collinear limit respectively. Since the\nmass dependence in Eq. (21) enters only through the gg result we can write\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(GG\u2192tt\u00af)\u3009|m =\nnDREDg\nnDREDG\n(\u3008M\nDRED\n(Gg\u2192tt\u00af)\u3009 \u2212 \u3008M\nDRED\n(G\u03c6\u2192tt\u00af)\u3009) , (26a)\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(GG\u2192tt\u00af)\u3009|m=0 = \u3008MDRED(Gg\u2192tt\u00af)\u3009|m=0 = \u3008MDRED(G\u03c6\u2192tt\u00af)\u3009. (26b)\nThus we see that the disturbing mass term in Eq. (15) indeed can be resolved\nas a linear combination of complete LO processes. Using eqs. (26) in Eq. (15)\ndirectly leads to Eq. (25).\n10\ngg\ng\ng\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\ng\n\u03c6\ng\n\u03c6\nFigure 2: Tree level diagrams for the four splitting processes involving g and \u03c6.\nFinally we note that in the massless case (26b), several of the LO processes\nbecome equal, which is why the collinear limit then takes a simpler form and the\nproblematic term in Eq. (15) disappears. This is however a peculiarity of the\nconsidered process and related to the absence of terms \u223c 1\/t\u20322 discussed in Sec.\n2, but it is not a generic feature of processes with massless partons.\n3.3 Splitting functions involving g and \u03c6\nIn this subsection we focus on the splitting functions appearing in Eq. (24), involv-\ning g and \u03c6 as partons. In order to consolidate our understanding of factorization\nin dred we will present an independent derivation of these splitting functions.\nInstead of reading them off from the collinear limits of particular NLO processes\nwe directly evaluate the amplitudes for the splitting processes\ng \u2192 g(x) g(1\u2212 x), g \u2192 \u03c6(x)\u03c6(1\u2212 x),\n\u03c6\u2192 \u03c6(x) g(1\u2212 x), \u03c6\u2192 g(x)\u03c6(1\u2212 x).\n(27)\nThe corresponding diagrams are shown in Fig. 2. Note that the amplitudes for\nsplitting processes involving an odd number of \u03c6 partons vanish at tree level. In\neach splitting process i \u2192 jk the momenta are assigned as pi \u2261 k2, pk \u2261 k3 as\ngiven in Eq. (12), and pj = k2\u2212 k3. In order to obtain the splitting probabilities,\nthe amplitudes are squared and summed over colours and polarizations according\nto Eq. (20). Only particle j is kept slightly off-shell, p2j \u223c k\n2\n\u22a5, and its Lorentz\nand colour indices are kept uncontracted. The result for each splitting process\nthus has the form P\u03c1\u03c1\n\u2032,aa\u2032\ni\u2192jk , where \u03c1, \u03c1\n\u2032 and a, a\u2032 are the open Lorentz and colour\nindices. Terms subleading in k\u22a5 are neglected and the average over the D \u2212 2\ntransverse directions is performed. Finally, terms proportional to (k2 \u2212 k3)\n\u03c1 or\n(k2\u2212k3)\n\u03c1\u2032 can be neglected, too. Due to the Ward identity they do not contribute\nif the splitting processes are part of a larger physical process where all particles\nare on-shell.\nAfter these manipulations, the results P\u03c1\u03c1\n\u2032,aa\u2032\ni\u2192jk take the form\nP\u03c1\u03c1\n\u2032,aa\u2032\ni\u2192jk = Pi\u2192jk(x)\n2(k2 \u2212 k3)\n2\nx\nnDREDi\nnDREDj\n\u03b4aa\u2032 g\n\u03c1\u03c1\u2032\n(j) . (28)\nThey are proportional to g\u02c6\u03c1\u03c1\n\u2032\nif j = g and to g\u02dc\u03c1\u03c1\n\u2032\nif j = \u03c6 (commonly abbreviated\nas g\u03c1\u03c1\n\u2032\n(j) here), and they are proportional to \u03b4aa\u2032 in colour space. As expected, the\n11\nprefactors are given by the splitting functions Pi\u2192jk(x) of Eq. (24), multiplied by\nadditional factors that compensate for the different prefactors in cross sections\nwith either i or j in the initial state.\nHence the functions given in Eq. (24) have a natural interpretation as universal\nsplitting functions. The fact that only one term appears on each right-hand side\nof Eq. (23) is due to the vanishing of the splitting functions involving an odd\nnumber of \u03c6\u2019s.\nFor future reference we introduce splitting functions corresponding to 4-\ndimensional gluons\nnDREDG PG\u2192jG =\n\u2211\nk=g,\u03c6\n(\nnDREDg Pg\u2192jk + n\nDRED\n\u03c6 P\u03c6\u2192jk\n)\n(29)\nand note that the splitting functions satisfy the sum rule\nnDREDG Pg\u2192gg =\n\u2211\nj=g,\u03c6\nnDREDG PG\u2192jG =\n\u2211\ni,j,k=g,\u03c6\nnDREDi Pi\u2192jk. (30)\nAs in Eq. (28), the factors nDREDG , n\nDRED\ng and n\nDRED\n\u03c6 appear because we are con-\nsidering the splitting of an initial state parton and, therefore, have to correct for\nthe factors due to the average over polarizations.\nWe close the subsection with several remarks. First, note that Pg\u2192gg is identi-\ncal to the well-known gluon splitting function in dreg. Second, the splitting func-\ntions involving \u03c6 coincide with the splitting functions involving massless squarks\nand gluons, given in Ref. [7], if the colour factors for squarks TR, CF are replaced\nby CA = N . The particular splitting function Pg\u2192\u03c6\u03c6 has already been made use\nof in Ref. [6] in order to study the difference between dred and dreg. And fi-\nnally, P\u03c6\u2192g\u03c6 is the prefactor of the puzzling term in Eq. (15), and it corresponds\nto the factor Kg in Ref. [9]. The nature of P\u03c6\u2192g\u03c6 as a splitting function explains\nthe universal behaviour of Kg described in this reference.\n3.4 Final result\nIn the previous subsections we have seen that the real NLO processes with partons\ng, \u03c6 indeed factorize in the collinear limit. The x-dependent prefactors can be\ninterpreted as the splitting functions Pi\u2192jk corresponding to the parton splittings\ng \u2192 gg, g \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6, \u03c6\u2192 g\u03c6, \u03c6\u2192 \u03c6g. Thus the results for the collinear limits take\na very systematic form:\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(ij\u2192tt\u00afk)\u3009\n\u30082\u20163\u3009\n\u2212\u2192\n\u22122g2\nt\u2032\n[ \u2211\nl=g,\u03c6\nPj\u2192lk\u3008MDRED(il\u2192tt\u00af)\u3009\n]\n, (31)\nwhere i, j, k = g, \u03c6. The sums on the right-hand side all collapse to one single\nterm since only the four aforementioned splitting functions can contribute, while\n12\nsplitting functions with an odd number of \u03c6\u2019s vanish at tree level. Similarly,\nusing the combinations (29) of splitting functions involving G, the result for the\nprocess involving only 4-dimensional gluons can be expressed as\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(GG\u2192tt\u00afG)\u3009\n\u30082\u20163\u3009\n\u2212\u2192\n\u22122g2\nt\u2032\n[ \u2211\nj=g,\u03c6\nPG\u2192jG\u3008MDRED(Gj\u2192tt\u00af)\u3009\n]\n. (32)\nAlthough there is a non-trivial structure on the right-hand side, this result has\nthe form that is expected from the factorization theorem.\nFor comparison, we repeat the corresponding result for the case of dreg with\nadapted notation:\n\u3008M\nDREG\n(gg\u2192tt\u00afg)\u3009\n\u30082\u20163\u3009\n\u2212\u2192\n\u22122g2\nt\u2032\n[\nPg\u2192gg\u3008MDREG(gg\u2192tt\u00af)\u3009\n]\n. (33)\nIn the remainder of this section we briefly discuss the relation between dred\nand dreg for the cross sections. The results for the collinear limits can be\nelevated to the level of cross sections by performing the suitable phase-space\nintegration and taking into account the second collinear limit 1\u20163. The singular\nterms in the collinear limits yield the subtraction terms that render the cross\nsection finite. In dreg, the subtracted hard scattering cross section d\u03c3\u02c6DREG at\nNLO is given by\u222b\nd\u03c3\u02c6DREGgg\u2192tt\u00afg =\n\u222b\nd\u03c3DREGgg\u2192tt\u00afg\n+\n[\u222b 1\u2212\u03b4\n0\ndx1\n(\n\u03b1s\n2\u03c0\n1\n\u01eb\nPg\u2192gg(x1)\n)\nd\u03c3DREGgg\u2192tt\u00af(x1k1, k2)\n+\n\u222b 1\u2212\u03b4\n0\ndx2\n(\n\u03b1s\n2\u03c0\n1\n\u01eb\nPg\u2192gg(x2)\n)\nd\u03c3DREGgg\u2192tt\u00af(k1, x2k2)\n]\n(34)\nwith \u03b1s = g\n2\/(4\u03c0) and D = 4\u2212 2\u01eb. In dred it can be defined analogously:\u222b\nd\u03c3\u02c6DREDGG\u2192tt\u00afG =\n\u222b\nd\u03c3DREDGG\u2192tt\u00afG\n+\n\u2211\nj=g,\u03c6\n[\u222b 1\u2212\u03b4\n0\ndx1\n(\n\u03b1s\n2\u03c0\n1\n\u01eb\nPG\u2192jG(x1)\n)\nd\u03c3DREDjG\u2192tt\u00af(x1k1, k2)\n+\n\u222b 1\u2212\u03b4\n0\ndx2\n(\n\u03b1s\n2\u03c0\n1\n\u01eb\nPG\u2192jG(x2)\n)\nd\u03c3DREDGj\u2192tt\u00af(k1, x2k2)\n]\n. (35)\nIn these equations, all integration regions are assumed to contain the same\ncollinear regions. The small parameter \u03b4 > 0 excludes the region around xi = 1,\n13\nwhich would lead to further infrared singularities that cancel only by adding the\nvirtual NLO corrections.\nThese subtracted cross sections are free of collinear singularities and, by con-\nstruction, the non-singular remainders in both regularization schemes are equal\nup to terms of O(4\u2212D):3\u222b\nd\u03c3\u02c6DREGgg\u2192tt\u00afg =\n\u222b\nd\u03c3\u02c6DREDGG\u2192tt\u00afG +O(4\u2212D). (36)\nEqs. (34)\u2013(36) can also be derived directly from the puzzling result Eq. (6.28) in\nRef. [1] by inserting our expression (26a) for the disturbing mass term.\nThis shows that the final hadronic cross section, which is obtained from d\u03c3\u02c6\nthrough convolution with parton distribution functions, can be evaluated both\nusing dreg or using dred. In particular, eq. (36) shows that the same factor-\nization scheme can be realized using either dreg or dred, and therefore the\nsame parton distribution functions (e.g. defined in the MS factorization scheme)\nhave to be used in both cases. The structure of the calculation is the same.\nThe only difference is the appearance of the two independent partons g, \u03c6 in the\nsubtraction terms for dred that lead from d\u03c3 to d\u03c3\u02c6.\n4 Conclusions\nWe have considered the factorization problem of dred that has repeatedly shown\nup in the literature [1,8,9]. Eq. (15) exhibits the seemingly non-factorizing terms\nin the collinear limit of the process gg \u2192 tt\u00afg. We have shown that the problem\ncan be completely solved.\nThe key to the solution is to consider the 4-dimensional gluon G in dred as\na combination of the D-dimensional gluon g and 4 \u2212 D \u01eb-scalars \u03c6. If g and \u03c6\nare treated as independent partons as in Eq. (25), the collinear limit acquires a\nfactorized form. The problematic terms on the right-hand side are replaced by\na linear combination of several LO processes involving g and \u03c6. Furthermore\nwe have shown that the coefficients in this linear combination have a natural\ninterpretation as splitting functions.\nThe final form of the collinear limit is displayed in eqs. (31) and (32). We\nhave shown that the result for the collinear limit can be transferred to the level\nof cross sections and that the hadron cross section can be evaluated using both\ndreg or dred. All results have a very systematic and natural structure.\n3Note that the factorization scheme has been implicitly fixed in eqs. (34), (35). Different\nfactorization schemes can be realized by adding identical terms in the brackets multiplying the\nd\u03c3ij\u2192tt\u00af in eqs. (34), (35). The resulting subtracted cross sections in dreg and dred are then\nstill equal.\n14\nIn summary, the factorization problem of dred, i.e. the presence of seemingly\nnon-factorizing terms, is not a problem but a signal that the distinction between\ng and \u03c6 as independent partons cannot be ignored. The solution does not affect\nthe computation of the NLO diagrams itself. Only the expectation from the\ncollinear limit and the structure of the subtraction terms needed to obtain the\nhard scattering cross section have to reflect this distinction. Although we have\nonly considered the process gg \u2192 tt\u00afg as an example and ignored virtual NLO\ncorrections, one can expect that factorization in dred holds in general and even\nin higher orders. The details of the general construction of finite, regularization-\nindependent hard scattering cross sections will be left for future work.\nAn interesting remaining question is for which processes the factorization\nproblem and the decomposition of the 4-dimensional gluon as G = g + \u03c6 is\nrelevant in general. While a general answer to this question is beyond the scope\nof the present article, we can give two criteria, based on the analysis of the\nconsidered process, where the problem disappears for m = 0.\nFrom the point of view of Sec. 2, for m = 0 the terms of the order 1\/t\u20322 vanish.\nIn this case, no average over the transverse direction of the collinear gluon has\nto be performed. Therefore, the result in dred is trivially the D = 4 limit of the\ndreg-result, and in both regularizations factorization holds in the naive way.\nFrom the point of view of Sec. 3, in the massless case the LO processes with\nGG, Gg or G\u03c6 in the initial state all become equal, see Eq. (26b). As a result,\nin the collinear limit (32) no distinction between the different LO processes has\nto be made, and the prefactors combine to the sum PG\u2192gG + PG\u2192\u03c6G, which is\nsimply equal to Pg\u2192gg according to the sum rule (30). Hence the collinear limit\nin dred again reduces to the naive form involving only 4-dimensional gluons and\none splitting function Pg\u2192gg.\nThe situation is different for the process with one more leg, gg \u2192 tt\u00afg with\na hard gluon in the final state. We have checked that for this example, e.g.\n\u3008M\nDRED\n(Gg\u2192tt\u00afG)\u3009 6= \u3008M\nDRED\n(G\u03c6\u2192tt\u00afG)\u3009 already for m = 0 in contrast to Eq. (26b).\nTherefore, the factorization problem is not generally linked to the presence of\nmassive partons but rather to sufficiently complicated kinematics.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to P.
