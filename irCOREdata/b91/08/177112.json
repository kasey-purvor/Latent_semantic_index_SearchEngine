Benign prostatic enlargement caused\nby hyperplasia of the gland is an inevitable and pro-\ngressive accompaniment to ageing in men. It is the\nmain cause of lower urinary tract symptoms, such as\nfrequency and poor flow, with a prevalence of about\n30% in men aged over 60, amounting to 1.8 million in\nthe United Kingdom.1 Treatments for urinary symp-\ntoms presumed to be caused by benign prostatic enlar-\ngement control symptoms rather than lead to a cure,\ngiving a long term risk of disease progression despite\nan initial response.2 Endoscopic removal of prostate\ntissue, typically by transurethral resection (TURP), is\nusually recommended to men who have not benefited\nfrom behavioural or drug treatment as it offers a high\n(70-80%) chance of benefit and a low (1% per year) risk\nof retreatment. About 25 000 such procedures are car-\nried out annually in England at a cost of \u00a353m (\u20ac57m,\n$76m). Despite sustained effectiveness, transurethral\nresection carries the risk of major haemorrhage and\nmyocardial stress.3 Consequently, alternative surgical\noptions have been trialled to reduce treatmentmorbid-\nity but maintain effectiveness.\nIn a systematic review of effectiveness we concluded\nthat newer technologies, such as microwave thermo-\ntherapy and diathermy or laser vaporisation, do\nimprove symptoms and reduce risk but have higher\nrates of retreatment than transurethral resection.4 5\nAccording to personal preference, men seeking treat-\nment might trade off this reduced effectiveness for the\nreduced risk. For most this would result in successful\ntreatment but a minority would have the inconveni-\nence and exposure to risk of having to have a second\n1Institute of Health and Society,\nNewcastle University, Newcastle\nupon Tyne NE2 4AA\n2Health Services Research Unit\nand Health Economics Research\nUnit, Institute of Applied Health\nSciences, University of Aberdeen,\nAberdeen AB25 2ZD\n3Academic Urology Unit, Institute\nof Applied Health Sciences,\nUniversity of Aberdeen\n4Urology Research Group,\nInstitute of Cellular Medicine,\nNewcastle University, Newcastle\nupon Tyne NE2 4HH\nCorrespondence to: R Pickard\nr.s.pickard@ncl.ac.uk\nCite this as: BMJ 2009;338:b1288\ndoi:10.1136\/bmj.b1288\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 1 of 13\n on 8 June 2009 bmj.comDownloaded from \nmore effective but potentiallymoremorbid procedure.\nThis might also give improvement from a healthcare\nperspective as use of themore morbid and costly treat-\nments would be reduced. Such treatment sequences\nreflect current practice, particularly in the United\nStates, where office based minimally invasive treat-\nments aremore widely used. Previous studies of health\neconomics focused on single treatments without allow-\nance for repeat or alternative treatment and provided\nonly limited cost breakdown and sensitivity analysis,\nrestricting generalisability across healthcare\nsystems.6-8 We modelled the use of plausible strategies\nof sequential treatments to maintain symptom control\nover an appropriate time span to determine which is\nmost likely to be cost effective.\nMETHODS\nModel design\nWe constructed a Markov model to investigate cost\nutility of each considered treatment option with effects\nmeasured by quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and\ncosts (\u00a3) at 2006 prices discounted at 3.5%.9 The per-\nspective was the UK\u2019s NHS, with treatments taking\nplace in appropriately equipped hospitals served by\nspecialist urologists already competent to carry out\nthe procedures.\nTreatment options and care pathways\nThe standard procedure was transurethral resection,\nwith failure to benefit or subsequent relapse managed\nby a second transurethral resection carried out only if\nurodynamics confirmed obstruction of the bladder\noutlet. Alternative treatments were categorised into\nthree groups: minimally invasive, characterised by no\ntissue removal and ambulatory care; tissue ablative,\nsignifying the use of differing energy sources to par-\ntially remove prostate tissue; and near total removal\nof prostate by holmium laser enucleation (HoLEP).\nAppraisal of the evidence base for effectiveness,4 5 cur-\nrent practice, and commercial availability identified\ntransurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT)\nand diathermy vaporisation (TUVP) as typifying the\nminimally invasive and tissue ablative groups, respec-\ntively. We also included potassium titanyl phosphate\n(KTP) laser vaporisation in themodel as a substitute for\ndiathermy vaporisation given its current clinical\nTable 1 | Schematic illustrating 23 treatment strategies tested in model.

Sequences were\ndefined by a set of rules reflecting current and likely\nfuture use of each method: treatments always pro-\nceeded from less to more invasive; minimally invasive\ntreatments could be repeated only once; tissue ablative\nand holmium laser enucleation procedures could not\nbe repeated because of the effect on remaining prostate\ntissue and near total removal, respectively; and trans-\nurethral resection could be repeated only once and\nonly after confirmation of obstruction of the bladder\noutlet (table 1). 11\nPopulation of patients\nThepopulationwasmenwith symptoms (international\nprostate symptom score (IPSS) >7) with presumed\nbenign prostatic enlargement without specification of\nprostate size and no existing relevant complications,\nwho required transurethral resection. The mean age\nwas set at 70, the mid-point of the age range for men\nundergoing this surgery.\nModel structure\nWe constructed a Markov model describing the\nsequence of events and main health states that men\nmight find themselves in after the defined treatment\nstrategies. The cycle length was set at three months,\nthe period over which benefit would occur and short\nterm adverse events resolve. We chose a time horizon\nof 10 years as this was the period over which the popu-\nlation would be likely to seek active treatment and cur-\nrent technologies would remain relevant. The model\nwas run by entering 10 successive annual cohorts of\n25 000 men, the number receiving treatment each\nyear in the NHS in England. We chose a multiple\ncohort design to better model the effects of applying\nsequences of escalating treatment and where progres-\nsively fewer members of a cohort would need addi-\ntional surgery. The design also simulates the purchase\nof new equipment as required over the stated time hor-\nizon.\nDefinition of health states\nWe defined six health states: treatment, remission, no\nremission, remission with incontinence, no remission\nwith incontinence, and death. Remission was defined\nas a more than 10% improvement in the international\nprostate symptom score, equivalent, for the population\nunder study, to the 3 point reduction noticeable by\nmen undergoing treatment for symptoms presumed\nto be caused by benign prostatic enlargement.12 The\nnumber of cycles spent by each individual in this\nstate was determined by the probability of relapse\nTable 2 | Utility values and miscellaneous risks and costs used to specify Monte Carlo simulation in decision analytical model\nCondition Value* Standard error (95% CI) Source Assigned distribution\nUtility values\nHealth states:\nRemission 1.00 0 Kok et al15 Beta\nNo remission 0.94 0.009 (0.92 to 0.96) Kok et al15 Beta\nIncontinence 0.89 0.006 (0.88 to 0.91) Ackerman et al16 Beta\nAdverse effects\u2020:\nUrinary retention 0.89 0.012 (0.87 to 0.92) Ackerman et al16 Beta\nBladder neck stenosis 0.95 0.001 (0.95 to 0.96) Ackerman et al16 Beta\nUrinary tract infection 0.93 0.004 (0.92 to 0.94) Ackerman et al16 Beta\nTransurethral resection syndrome 0.81 0.022 (0.77 to 0.85) Ackerman et al16 Beta\nMiscellaneous variables\nRisks:\nTransurethral resection after urinary\nretention\n0.5 0.05 (0.40 to 0.6) Expert opinion Beta\nUrge type incontinence 0.95 0.02 (0.91 to 0.99) Expert opinion Beta\nCosts:\nBaseline treatment (including mean length\nof stay) (\u00a3)\n1862 (1546 to 2195)\u2021 NHS 200617 Lognormal\nUrology ward bed day (\u00a3) 250 (141 to 443)\u2021 NHS 200617 Lognormal\nLength of stay after transurethral resection\nsyndrome (days)\n2 0.51 (1 to 3) Expert opinion Normal\nLength of stay after urinary infection (days) 3 1.4 (0.25 to 5.75) Expert opinion Normal\nUrodynamic test (\u00a3) 125 16 (92 to 157) NHS 200517 Normal\nTransfusion (\u00a3) 1270 323 (635 to 1905) NHS tariff Normal\nOxybutynin (\u00a3) 166 (65 to 267)\u00a7 NHS drug tariff Uniform\n*Risk unless otherwise stated.\n\u2020Age adjusted mortality rates estimated from UK life tables and applied equally throughout time horizon without weighting according to procedure.\n\u2021Where log distributions have been used, standard error is omitted to avoid inconsistency with confidence interval, which is expressed as actual relative risk.\n\u00a7Limits of uniform distribution.\nRESEARCH\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 3 of 13\n on 8 June 2009 bmj.comDownloaded from \nafter an initially successful treatment derived from long\nterm observation data. The state of \u201cno remission\u201dwas\nentered with the probability of initial failure or subse-\nquent relapse for that particular treatment. Inconti-\nnence, defined as leakage of urine of sufficient degree\nto make an individual seek help and therefore result in\nadditional treatment, was the only complication we\nincluded in themodel. If this occurred no further treat-\nment was possible and only transitions from remission\nto no remission or to death could occur. All other com-\nplications (urinary retention, bladder neck stenosis\nand\/or urethral stricture, blood transfusion (a measure\nof severe bleeding), transurethral syndrome, and urin-\nary infection) were considered as short term and were\nassumed to have been resolved within the threemonth\ntreatment state. Retrograde ejaculation was not\nincluded as it is generally of little trouble to the popula-\ntion ofmen under study,13 and erectile dysfunctionwas\nnot included as incidence was similar for all inter-\nventions and for untreated men.4 5 14 Death was mod-\nelled as an absorbing state with age dependent\ntransition probabilities calculated from UK life tables\nwithout weighting according to procedure.

Probabilities for other\ntreatments were calculated with the relative risk\nreported in the meta-analysis.\nMortality\u2014Our meta-analysis22 and a previous sys-\ntematic review17 showed that there was no evidence\nfor different mortality rates after each procedure at\n12 months, while age adjusted longer term rates after\ntransurethral resection are known to be similar to those\nin the general population.23 The only trial comparing\ntransurethral resection against advice on managing\nsymptoms alone also showed no difference in mortal-\nity rates.24 We therefore applied age specific popula-\ntion mortality rates for English men, irrespective of\ntreatment or treatment sequence in line with previous\neconomic evaluations in this area.7\nCosts\nWe considered only hospital costs because primary\ncare costs would be low and similar for each procedure\n(tables 2, 3, 4). Endoscopic procedures (diathermy or\nlaser vaporisation, laser enucleation, and transurethral\nresection) were assumed to incur the same basic costs\n(2005 NHS reference costs for healthcare resource\ngroup (code L28), adjusted for differing length of stay\nby subtracting bed-day cost calculated from a non-\noperative code (L09). We added appropriate extra\ncosts for equipment, such as optical fibres for laser\ntransmission and tissue morcellators for laser enuclea-\ntion, using data provided by UK based manufacturers\nor distributors. As a UK reference cost for microwave\nthermotherapy was unavailable we calculated it using\nmanufacturers\u2019 data from the US, day case procedure\nNHS reference costs, and clinical expert opinion.\nCapital costs of the relevant energy generator for\nmicrowave thermotherapy, laser vaporisation, and\nlaser enucleation were derived from commercial\nsources. The costs of short term complications were\ncalculated by summing costs of extra interventions,\nsuch as blood transfusion or bladder neck incision,\nand extra bed days calculated from the cost difference\nbetween L27 (transurethral resection with complica-\ntions) andL28 (transurethral resectionwithout compli-\ncations). The cost of incontinencewas derived from the\ndrug tariff for oxybutyninmultiplied by the proportion\nof men (95%) having urge incontinence as defined by\nthe clinical expert group. For the 5% ofmenwith stress\nincontinence the cost was that for insertion of an artifi-\ncial urinary sphincter (\u00a36000).\nSensitivity analysis\nProbabilistic\nTo test for the effect of uncertainty in parameter esti-\nmates,we usedMonteCarlo simulation to select values\nfor each parameter within the model according to a\ndistribution around each parameter. Limits of uncer-\ntainty were defined with 95% confidence intervals\nfrom meta-analysis, the individual dataset, NHS\ncost ranges, and expert opinion, with distribution\nshapes chosen according to standard practice (tables 2,\n3, 4).25 These values were then combined in the Mar-\nkov model to estimate the outcome for each treatment\nstrategy by repeating the process 10 000 times and cal-\nculating the expected cost and effectiveness of each\ntreatment sequence as the mean across all samples.\nWe chose the number of iterations by determining\nthe point at which addition of further samples did not\nresult in any change in the ranking.

In general, the use of escalating multiple treat-\nment strategies, starting with the option of diathermy\nvaporisation, showed increased effectiveness and\ndecreased cost. Both diathermy vaporisation followed\nbyholmium laser enucleation anddiathermyvaporisa-\ntion followed by transurethral resection, repeated if\nnecessary, dominated (that is, were more effective\nand less costly) than other strategies, including the\nreference standardof transurethral resection.The strat-\negy of diathermy vaporisation followed by transure-\nthral resection repeated if necessary became cost\neffective if the willingness to pay threshold was >\n\u00a380 000\/QALY gained. Diathermy vaporisation as a\nsingle treatment was not dominated and highly likely\nto be cost effective at a willingness to pay threshold of\n\u00a35000\/QALY gained. Holmium laser enucleation as a\nsingle treatment dominated transurethral resection,\nbut the probability of it being the most cost effective\nstrategy never exceeded 0.37. All strategies starting\nwith microwave thermotherapy were dominated, as\nwere those involving potassium titanyl phosphate\nlaser vaporisation.Direct comparisonbetween alterna-\ntive strategies and the reference strategy of transure-\nthral resection, repeated if necessary, gave similar\nresults.\nSensitivity analysis\nModel parameters\nTables 6, 7, and 8 show the results of one way sensitiv-\nity analyses. If we derived the probability used to pre-\ndict treatment failure from reoperation rates, as\nsuggested by meta-analysis, then holmium laser enu-\ncleation as a single treatment became extendedly\ndominated by strategies startingwith diathermyvapor-\nisation. If length of stay for transurethral resection was\nreduced from three to two days then the current refer-\nence strategy of transurethral resection, repeated if\nneeded,was no longer dominated bydiathermyvapor-\nisation. If performanceof urodynamicswasmademan-\ndatory for treatment failure after diathermy\nvaporisation then the standard strategyof transurethral\nresection, repeated if necessary,was not dominatedbut\nhad an incremental cost perQALYgainedof \u00a3230 608.\nUsing a single cohort of 25 000 men generally showed\nsimilar incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) for\nnon-dominated strategies except for diathermy vapor-\nisation followed by transurethral resection, repeated if\nnecessary.

Single treatment with holmium laser enuclea-\ntion was cost effective only at a threshold of between\n\u00a37600 and \u00a39500 and its probability of being cost effec-\ntive was never greater than 0.37. In addition, it is a\ntechnically demandingprocedure requiring prolonged\ntraining and a high level of competency to avoid ser-\nious adverse effects such as urinary sphincter damage\nand bladder perforation. It is therefore probably\nunsuited to widespread application and best used as\nthe final part of a treatment sequence, administered in\na few specialist centres for menwho relapse after trans-\nurethral resection or vaporisation. It also became\ndominated by diathermy vaporisation led strategies\nwhen we recalculated reoperation rates.\nThe finding that potassium titanyl phosphate laser\nvaporisation was unlikely to be cost effective, either\nas a single treatment or within a treatment sequence,\nis important as the procedure has gainedwide popular-\nity around the world because of its perceived ease of\nuse and reduced risk of bleeding and despite the lack of\nevidence of equivalent or improved effectiveness over\ntransurethral resection. Although we obtained out-\ncome parameters for this option from the single eligi-\nble published trial involving potassium titanyl\nphosphate laser vaporisation available at the time of\nour meta-analysis and from other trials involving\nvaporisation using alternative lasers, the finding was\nunchanged by sensitivity analysis around uncertainty\nin treatment benefit. In addition, a subsequent publica-\ntion has noted reduced efficacy and increased retreat-\nment rates compared with transurethral resection.29\nThis option was also associated with relatively high\ncost because of the need for one or more disposable\noptical fibres, but again the conclusions were not\naltered by sensitivity analysis around this variable\nand were not compensated by reduced length of stay\nor savings from the reduced complication rate. This\nresult, based on current evidence, therefore does not\nsupport its current unrestricted use in clinical practice.\nUse of strategies\nSequences of escalating treatmentsweremore effective\nthan single treatments, and this supports the need to\ncompare clinically plausible strategies as well as one-\noff treatments in clinical trials. This policy of care\nwould be particularly attractive for large centrally\nmanaged healthcare systems, such as the UK NHS,\nwhereby widespread use of a less morbid, technically\nless demanding, and cheaper option, such as dia-\nthermy vaporisation, could be widely offered as the\ninitial treatment in various settings, whereas holmium\nTable 6 | Results of sensitivity analysis* showing effects on cost effectiveness of variation in start age and utility value for\nstate of incontinence\nTreatment strategy Cost (\u00a3) Incremental cost (\u00a3)\nEffectiveness\n(QALYs)\nIncremental\neffectiveness\n(QALYs)\nIncremental cost\neffectiveness ratio\n(\u00a3\/QALYs)\nBase case\nDiathermy vaporisation 380 774 844 \u2014 917 082 \u2014 \u2014\nHolmium laser enucleation 400 549 783 19 774 939 919 656 2574 7682\nDiathermy vaporisation + holmium laser\nenucleation\n413 712 972 13 163 189 921 041 1385 9505\nDiathermyvaporisation+TURP repeated\nonce if necessary\n418 264 231 4 551 258 921 091 50 90 576\nStart age 90\nDiathermy vaporisation 376 991 192 541 771\nHolmium laser enucleation 397 495 122 20 503 931 543 268 1497 13 695\nDiathermy vaporisation + holmium laser\nenucleation\n405 702 102 8 206 980 543 703 435 18 872\nDiathermy vaporisation + TURP 409 475 528 3 773 426 543 715 12 309 087\nStart age 50\nDiathermy vaporisation 381 248 895 \u2014 1 002 040 \u2014 \u2014\nHolmium laser enucleation 400 940 948 19 692 053 100 4857 2818 6988\nDiathermy vaporisation + holmium laser\nenucleation\n414 850 642 13 909 693 100 6451 1594 8727\nDiathermyvaporisation+TURP repeated\nonce if necessary\n419 518 524 4 667 882 100 6511 59 78 771\nUtility of \u201cincontinence-no remission\u201d = utility of \u201cincontinence-remission\u201d\nDiathermy vaporisation 380 774 844 917 131 \u2014 \u2014\nHolmium laser enucleation 400 549 783 19 774 939 919 679 2548 7762\nDiathermy vaporisation + holmium\nvaporisation\n413 712 972 13 163 189 921 092 1413 9315\nDiathermyvaporisation+TURP repeated\nonce if necessary\n418 264 231 4 551 258 921 144 52 88 045\nQALY=quality adjusted life year; TURP=transurethral resection of prostate.\n*Based on 10 000 Monte Carlo simulation samples and showing only non-dominated and non-extendedly dominated strategies.\nRESEARCH\npage 8 of 13 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\n on 8 June 2009 bmj.comDownloaded from \nlaser enucleation, with its need for highly skilled opera-\ntors, would be available in a limited number of specia-\nlised units to treat the relatively small number of men\nwho fail to benefit or relapse after a vaporisation pro-\ncedure. The findings of our study and associated sys-\ntematic reviews45 suggest the need for longer termhigh\nquality trials to test the worth of such sequences of\nnewer treatment. A multicentre head-to-head rando-\nmised controlled trial of this strategy against the stan-\ndard of transurethral resection, repeated as needed,\nfollowed by a longer term \u201ctracker\u201d trial of the newer\ntechnologies should particularly assess the need, rea-\nson, and chosen technique for retreatment after failure\nor relapse. The design would need to be flexible to\nencompass new technologies as they emerge and\naccount for changes in current technology, such as\nincreased power and reduced fibre cost for laser vapor-\nisation, and should be sufficiently powered to reduce\nuncertainty regarding cost effectiveness. To better\njudge cost effectiveness it would be necessary to con-\nsider inmore detail how symptom scoresmap to utility\nvalues and howQALY gains estimated by disease spe-\ncific symptom scores compare with estimates by using\na generic instrument such as theEQ-5D.Calculation of\nutility values would be strengthened by qualitative\nresearch components to record preferences of indivi-\ndual men concerning the trade-off between reduced\ntreatment morbidity and increased risk of reoperation.\nUncertainties\nAlthough we have used the best available methods to\ndefine the likely outcomes of each treatment, limita-\ntions in the current evidence base lead to inevitable\nuncertainty regarding parameter values. Reassuringly,\nsensitivity analysis around appropriately selected vari-\nables did not radically change key outcomes of the\nmodel. Calculation of the expected value of perfect\ninformation according to standard practice30 suggested\nthat an upper overall limit of \u00a35.3m should be spent on\nfurther research to give worthwhile benefit, with speci-\nfic studies of vaporisation techniques and holmium\nlaser enucleation having upper limits of \u00a34.2m and\n\u00a31.7m, respectively.

Our model\nwas based on a rigorous systematic review of the inter-\nnational literature. We also made strenuous efforts to\nbe transparent in our reporting, which should allow\nresearchers and decision makers to make judgments\nabout the applicability of the work to their own set-\ntings. The use of a multiple cohort model allowed con-\nsideration of the diseconomies associated with using a\ncostly, capital intensive second or third line treatment\nby simulating the purchasing of new equipment as\nrequired over the time horizon and avoided bias inher-\nent in the allocation of capital costs across the whole\npopulation and time period using a single cohort tech-\nnique. As a result, we believe that this model gives\nimproved meaning regarding the effects of changing\ntreatment policy for decision makers as well as clini-\ncians.\nLimitations of the model\nInitially, we included in the model other procedures\nidentified in the systematic review\u2014such as bipolar\ndiathermy resection and holmium laser vaporisation\n\u2014but the number of possible treatment sequences\nbecame unmanageable and we therefore focused on\ntechnologies in current wide use or those with an\nextensive evidence base. Selection between vaporisa-\ntion techniques with different energy sources pre-\nsented a difficulty, with diathermy having the greatest\nevidence base but potassium titanyl phosphate laser\ncurrently being the most popular. Both were run in\nthe model and the result in terms of cost effectiveness\nwas markedly in favour of diathermy, despite its cur-\nrent unpopularity.Given that these techniques achieve\nthe same surgical result in terms of tissue ablation it is\nlikely that a future laser procedure,which replicates the\ntreatment benefit and low cost of diathermy, could take\nits placewithin the sequenceof cost effective treatment.\nThe probability of failure for treatments under study\nwas a key parameter but difficult to quantify with cer-\ntainty; lack of change in symptoms was the preferred\ndefinition but it was uncertain how this was reflected in\nreoperation rates published in the literature, which dif-\nfered between studies. Our resolution was to use indi-\nvidual level data, and this seemed valid because a\nsensitivity analysis with a different approach gave lar-\ngely consistent results. The use of a threshold of <10%\nimprovement in symptoms reflected the definite need\nfor further surgery as distinct from other definitions of\ntreatment success used in trials of treatment. It would,\nhowever, be important to validate this threshold in\nfuture studies by prospectively recording reasons for\nretreatment. Mapping of symptom scores to utility\nvalues was another difficulty, which we resolved by\nsynthesising available data. Again sensitivity analysis\nsuggests that our approach was reasonable, although\nthe need for further research in this area is acknowl-\nedged.\nCosts were deliberately based on the setting of the\nNHS in England because this provided the most com-\nprehensive source of data, and, again, sensitivity ana-\nlysis suggests that the choices made were robust,\nalthough translation to other healthcare systems\nmight not be clear cut. We did not consider costs asso-\nciated with staff retraining and service reconfiguration\nrequired to change practice away from the standard of\ntransurethral resection, but these are likely to be small\nif the cost effective strategy of vaporisation followed by\nholmium resection in the case of failure or relapse is\nadopted as sufficient capacity already exists. Any\nhealthcare provider, however, would need to consider\nthe opportunity cost of switching funding fromanother\narea to implement the policy change.\nTable 8 | Results of sensitivity analysis* showing effects on cost effectiveness of variation in use of urodynamic test after\nfailed surgery and use of single cohort model\nTreatment strategy Cost (\u00a3) Incremental cost (\u00a3)\nEffectiveness\n(QALYs)\nIncremental\neffectiveness\nQALYs)\nIncremental cost\neffectiveness ratio\n(\u00a3\/QALYs)\nUrodynamic test mandatory after failed diathermy vaporisation\nDiathermy vaporisation 380 774 844 \u2014 917 082 \u2014 \u2014\nHolmium laser enucleation 400 549 783 19 774 939 919 656 2574 7682\nDiathermy vaporisation + holmium\nvaporisation\n405 478 440 4 928 657 920 051 395 12 475\nDiathermy vaporisation+ TURP repeated\nonce if necessary\n409 175 523 3 697 083 920 128 78 47 659\nTURP repeated once if necessary 457 866 096 48 690 573 920 340 211 230 608\nSingle cohort model\nDiathermy vaporisation 1794 7.12\nHolmium laser enucleation 1819 25 7.14 0.0202 1 242\nDiathermy vaporisation + holmium\nvaporisation\n1958 139 7.15 0.0129 10 755\nDiathermy vaporisation+ TURP repeated\nonce if necessary\n1990 31 7.15 0.0005 60 896\nQALY=quality adjusted life year; TURP=transurethral resection of prostate.\n*Based on 10 000 Monte Carlo simulation samples and showing non-dominated and non-extendedly dominated strategies only.\nRESEARCH\npage 10 of 13 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\n on 8 June 2009 bmj.comDownloaded from \nThe population studied in themodel was sufficiently\nhealthy to undergo any of the procedures. In practice,\nmenwith comorbidities resulting in an excessive risk of\nbleeding or fluid imbalance tend to be advised against\ntransurethral resection. For these men, less morbid\nprocedures, such asmicrowave therapy and potassium\ntitanyl phosphate laser vaporisation, offer the opportu-\nnity for treatment and indeed are in widespread use for\nthis indication, but inclusion of this scenario would\nhave greatly increased the complexity of our model.\nOur remit was focused on surgical treatment and we\ntherefore assumed that men entering the model had\nalready tried and failed conservative management in\nthe form of advice on fluid management or drug treat-\nment. In future research it would be useful to add these\noptions at the start of treatment strategies to determine\noverall cost effectiveness of all options available for the\nmanagement of this condition.\nConclusion\nCurrent evidence suggests a sequence of treatments\nconsisting of initial diathermy vaporisation followed\nby either holmium laser enucleation or transurethral\nresection, repeated if necessary on failure or relapse,\nTable 9 | Time spent in each state of Markov model for base case disaggregated from quality of life and ranked in\ndescending order according to time in remission state\nTreatment strategy\nTime in health state* (years)\nTreatment Remission No remission Incontinence\u2020 Death\nDiathermy vaporisation + TURP repeated once\nif necessary\u2021\n0.27 7.92 0.04 0.09 1.67\nDiathermy vaporisation + holmium laser\nenucleation\u2021\n0.27 7.91 0.05 0.09 1.67\nDiathermy vaporisation + TURP 0.27 7.89 0.07 0.09 1.67\nTURP repeated once if necessary\u00a7 0.26 7.78 0.18 0.10 1.67\nMicrowave thermotherapy + diathermy\nvaporisation + TURP\n0.36 7.75 0.13 0.09 1.67\nMicrowave thermotherapy + diathermy\nvaporisation + TURP repeated once if\nnecessary\n0.36 7.75 0.12 0.09 1.67\nMicrowave thermotherapy + diathermy\nvaporisation + holmium laser enucleation\n0.36 7.75 0.12 0.09 1.67\nMicrowave thermotherapy + TURP repeated\nonce if necessary\n0.36 7.71 0.16 0.09 1.67\nMicrowave thermotherapy repeated once+\ndiathermy vaporisation + TURP\n0.40 7.68 0.16 0.09 1.67\nMicrowave thermotherapy repeated once +\ndiathermy vaporisation + TURP repeated once\nif necessary\n0.40 7.68 0.16 0.09 1.67\nMicrowave thermotherapy + holmium laser\nenucleation\n0.35 7.68 0.21 0.09 1.67\nMicrowave thermotherapy repeated once +\ndiathermy vaporisation + holmium laser\nenucleation\n0.40 7.68 0.16 0.09 1.67\nMicrowave thermotherapy repeated once +\nTURP repeated once if necessary\n0.40 7.67 0.17 0.09 1.67\nMicrowave thermotherapy repeated once +\nholmium laser enucleation\n0.40 7.66 0.19 0.09 1.67\nHolmium laser enucleation\u2021 0.25 7.65 0.33 0.09 1.67\nMicrowave thermotherapy repeated once +\nTURP\n0.40 7.63 0.21 0.09 1.67\nMicrowave thermotherapy repeated once +\ndiathermy vaporisation\n0.40 7.62 0.23 0.08 1.67\nMicrowave thermotherapy + TURP 0.35 7.61 0.27 0.09 1.67\nMicrowave thermotherapy + diathermy\nvaporisation\n0.35 7.56 0.33 0.08 1.67\nTURP\u00a7 0.25 7.44 0.55 0.09 1.67\nDiathermy vaporisation\u2020 0.25 7.27 0.72 0.09 1.67\nMicrowave thermotherapy repeated once 0.35 6.82 1.08 0.08 1.67\nPotassium titanyl phosphate vaporisation 0.25 5.65 2.21 0.21 1.67\nMicrowave thermotherapy 0.25 5.28 2.74 0.06 1.67\nTURP=transurethral resection of prostate.\n*Not discounted.\n\u2020Includes \u201cincontinence-no remission\u201d and \u201cincontinence-remission.\u201d\n\u2021Non-dominated strategy.\n\u00a7Reference strategy.\nRESEARCH\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 11 of 13\n on 8 June 2009 bmj.comDownloaded from \nare cost effective strategies for surgical treatment of\nsymptoms presumed to be caused by benign enlarge-\nment of the prostate.
