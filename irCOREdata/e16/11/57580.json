Introduction\n24 [2] Recent advances in theory [e.g.,Wapenaar, 2004] have\n25 shown that the cross correlation of ambient noise recorded at\n26 two seismic stations can be used to yield the elastic impulse\n27 response of the Earth, or Green\u2019s function, between the two\n28 stations as if one were a source and the other a receiver. This\n29 has been confirmed using seismic data [Campillo and Paul,\n30 2003; Shapiro and Campillo, 2004] and the method has\n31 beenwidely applied to Earth imaging [e.g., Sabra et al., 2005;\n32 Shapiro et al., 2005]. However, the method has also been\n33 applied to continuously monitor small changes in seismic\n34 velocity in the subsurface over a period of time. Snieder et al.\n35 [2002] show that scattered coda waves are more sensitive to\n36 small changes in seismic velocity. Sens\u2010Sch\u00f6nfelder and\n37 Wegler [2006] identify a relationship between velocity var-\n38 iations at Merapi volcano measured from passive seismic\n39 interferometry and a depth dependent hydrological model.\n40 Brenguier et al. [2008] use ambient seismic noise recorded at\n41 Piton de la Fournaise volcano to measure very small seismic\n42 velocity perturbations, that they link to pre\u2010eruptive inflation\n43 of the volcanic edifice. Both these studies demonstrate the\n44 potential of this method to monitor changes in volcanic\n45 behaviour over long periods of time.\n46 [3] The Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano (SHV), Montserrat, is an\n47 andesite dome\u2010building volcano in the Lesser Antilles arc\n48 (Figure 1). After a period of dormancy of several centuries\n49 the current eruption began in July 1995 [Young et al., 1998].\n56The eruption has been characterised by a number of phases\n57of lava extrusion to form the lava dome and subsequent\n58collapses involving pyroclastic flows and vulcanian explo-\n59sions. The first phase of dome growth lasted from 1995 to\n601998 with variable extrusion rates reaching up to 10 m3\/s\n61[Sparks et al., 1998]. The second phase of dome growth\n62lasted from 1999 to 2003 with more modest extrusion rates\n63reaching up to 4 m3\/s [Herd et al., 2005]. The lava dome\n64reached it\u2019s maximum height and volume in July 2003. The\n65subsequent collapse of the lava dome, beginning on 12 July,\n66is the largest recorded in historical times, with approxi-\n67mately 210 million m3 of material removed in 18 hours\n68[Herd et al., 2005]. A swarm of over 9500 hybrid earth-\n69quakes preceded the dome collapse [Ottem\u00f6ller, 2008], most\n70of which had nearly identical waveforms, suggesting a\n71highly repeatable source.\n72[4] In this paper, I use seismic interferometry to identify\n73changes in the Green\u2019s functions obtained from cross\u2010cor-\n74relation of ambient noise at the time of the collapse of the\n75lava dome at SHV in July 2003. The measured decorrelation\n76and phase shift can then be related to a velocity change under\n77the volcano. The aim is to show that lava dome collapse had\n78a measurable effect on seismic velocity but also that noise\n79correlation functions can provide a simple means to measure\n80changes in volcanic behaviour over a period of time.\n812. Data Processing and Results\n82[5] Noise correlation Green\u2019s functions (NCFs) are ex-\n83tracted from continuous seismic data recorded at pairs of\n84permanent broadband stations operated by the Montserrat\n1Earth Hazards and Systems, British Geological Survey, Edinburgh,\nUK.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094\u20108276\/10\/2010GL042489\nFigure 1.

In 2003, three broadband stations were operational,\n87 MBGB, MBGH and MBRY (Figure 1). The NCFs derived\n88 for station pairs MBRY\u2010MBGB and MBRY\u2010MBGH, should\n89 synthesize elastic waves propagating directly under the vol-\n90 canic edifice and provide an excellent means of measuring\n91 any changes in seismic properties.\n92 [6] Processing applied to each twenty\u2010four hour continu-\n93 ous data segment consisted of: 1) rotation of the horizontal\n94 components into the radial and transverse directions with\n95 respect to the great circle path between a given station pair; 2)\n96 a high pass filter applied at 0.5 Hz; 3) one\u2010bit normalisation\n97 to reduce the effect of amplitude variations in the ambient\n98 wavefield. The corresponding data segments for all three\n99 components of ground motion at each station were then\n100 cross\u2010correlated, resulting in a nine component noise corre-\n101lation function for each day, corresponding to each compo-\n102nent of the Green\u2019s tensor for a given station pair.\n103[7] Stacked daily NCFs for the month of June 2003\n104computed from cross correlating the vertical component\n105records (Z) at station MBRY with the vertical, radial and\n106transverse component records (Z, R and T) at stations\n107MBGH and MBGB are shown in Figure 2. Uniform scaling\n108has been applied to all traces. A clear 1.8 s pulse is observed\n109on the radial component for MBRY\u2010MBGH between 4 \u2013 8 s\n110and for MBRY\u2010MBGB between 5 \u2013 9 s. The particle motion\n111for this pulse is mainly restricted to the ZR plane and shows\n112the retrograde elliptical motion typical of a Rayleigh wave.\n113Given inter\u2010station distances for MBRY\u2010MBGH and\n114MBRY\u2010MBGB of 6.26 km and 8.55 km respectively, the\n115arrival times of the Rayleigh wave is consistent with group\n116velocities of 0.8 \u2013 1.7 km\/s. A significant amount of energy\n117also arrives before the Rayleigh wave pulse and is visible\nFigure 2. Stacked correlation functions for June 2003 computed from vertical component records at station MBRY and\nvertical (ZZ), radial (ZR) and transverse (ZT) component records at (a) MBGH and (b) MBGB). The particle motion plots\nare in the time window of the Rayleigh wave pulse shown by the vertical black lines.

This results in a linearly polarized arrival. Roux\n121 et al. [2005] show the presence of P\u2010waves in NCFs between\n122 stations at short ranges in the Parkfield network, and I sug-\n123 gest that these initial arrivals may also be P\u2010waves. There is\n124 very little energy observed from the transverse component at\n125 MBGH, which is consistent with a vertical point force\n126 Green\u2019s function in an isotropic, 1\u2010D, velocity model.\n127 However, station MBGB shows a strong arrival after the\n128 Rayleigh wave pulse that is dominantly polarized in the\n129 vertical transverse plane. This is not consistent with the ar-\n130 rivals expected at MBGB from a vertical point force at\n131 MBRY in a simple Earth model, and suggests more complex\n132 propagation characteristics. The theoretical Green tensor\n133 computed for a vertical point force in a simple isotropic four\n134 layer crustal model [Aspinall et al., 1998] and convolved\n135 with a 1.8 s parabolic pulse is shown by the dashed gray\n136 lines. The same high pass filter is applied to the synthetics as\n137to the observed data. This provides a reasonable match for\n138the observed Rayleigh wave arrivals on both stations, but\n139does not capture the arrivals either before or after.\n140[8] The resulting daily NCFs from the vertical component\n141at MBRY with the vertical, radial and transverse compo-\n142nents from MBGH and MBGB are shown in Figure 3. The\n143colour scale denotes signal amplitude and the same uniform\n144scaling is applied to all traces for each station pair and each\n145component. Both the causal (positive lags) and acausal\n146(negative lags) parts of the NCFs are shown. For both station\n147pairs, the causal amplitudes are significantly larger than\n148acausal as a result of the asymmetry in the background noise,\n149which comes mainly from the Atlantic Ocean side of the\n150island, and can be thought of as propagating across the array\n151from east to west. The NCFs are reasonably stable as a\n152function of time, with good signal to noise ratio, though there\n153are some obvious variations, such as the strong reduction in\n154the amplitude of the MBRY\u2010MBGB ZZ NCF after early July\n1552003. Lack of data at individual stations at various time\n156periods results in an absence of noise correlation functions\n157for certain times.\n158[9] To identify any temporal changes in the characteristics\n159of the NCFs, I compute both the correlation and phase shift,\n160dt, between the Rayleigh wave pulse on the ZR component\n161of the stacked NCF in Figure 2 with both the daily NCFs in\n162Figure 3 and a five day running stack of these NCFs over the\n163period June 2003 to end September 2003. The correlation is\n164measured from the maximum in the normalised cross\u2010cor-\n165relation function between the two signals. Error estimates\n166are obtained by computing the cross\u2010correlation in series of\n1671.28 s moving windows, then calculating the mean and\n168standard deviation for those windows coincident with the\n169Rayleigh pulse. The phase shift or time delay, dt between\n170the two signals can be computed from the slope of the phase\n171of the cross\u2010spectrum [Poupinet et al., 1984; Ratdomopurbo\n172and Poupinet, 1995]. Here I use the time lag of the maxi-\n173mum in the normalised cross\u2010correlation function as a\n174measure of the time delay, dt, between the reference NCF and\n175the daily NCFs. Time delays are computed in overlapping\n1761.28 s windows at different lapse times, t, in a time window\n177around the observed Rayleigh wave arrival. Assuming that\n178any measured time delay is caused by a homogeneous\n179velocity change dv\/v, the time delay dt should be inde-\n180pendent of the lapse time t at which it is measured and dv\/\n181v = \u2212dt\/t. Again, error estimates are obtained from the\n182mean and standard deviation of all time windows around\n183the Rayleigh pulse.\n184[10] The resulting decorrelation and velocity variations\n185measured from the ZR component of the NCFs between\n186station pairs MBRY\u2010MBGH and MBRY\u2010MBGB are shown\n187in Figure 4. Results for both the individual daily NCFs\n188(blue) and a five day running stack of the NCFs (red) are\n189shown. Throughout June and the first few days of July the\n190daily NCFs for both station pairs are very well correlated\n191with the reference NCF, with cross correlation coefficients\n192of greater than 0.98. No significant velocity variations are\n193observed. At the time of the collapse, there is a sudden change\n194in both correlation coefficient and the relative velocity for\n195both station pairs, with the correlation coefficient reducing to\n196around 0.9 and the relative velocity falling by approximately\n1970.5%. The relative velocity, although scattered, does not\n198change greatly from this value over the next three months.\nFigure 3.

Discussion and Conclusions\n202 [11] Three\u2010component Green\u2019s functions have been suc-\n203 cessfully calculated from ambient seismic noise for station\n204 paths that intersect the Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano. The NCFs\n205 calculated by cross\u2010correlating the vertical component of\n206 ground motion at station MBRY and the radial, vertical and\n207 transverse components of ground motion at stations MBGH\n208 and MBGB appear consistent with the Green\u2019s tensor ex-\n209 pected from a vertical point force source at MBRY recorded\n210 at MBGH and MBGB, and show clear evidence of Rayleigh\n211 waves with elliptical particle motion propagating at low\n212 group speeds along both paths. A dominantly vertically\n213 polarised arrival is observed before the Rayleigh wave for\n214 both station pairs and may suggest the presence of body\n215 waves in the NCFs. The observed difference between the\n216 causal and acausal parts of the NCFs is consistent with an\n217 asymmetry in the noise source, with oceanic noise from the\n218 Atlantic Ocean east of Montserrat dominating the observed\n219 noise field.\n220 [12] The NCFs in the one\u2010month period prior to the col-\n221 lapse of the lava dome in July 2003 are found to be extremely\n222 stable with only very small changes in both correlation co-\n223 efficient and relative velocity measured from the Rayleigh\n224 wave arrival between the daily NCFs and a reference func-\n225 tion. However, following the collapse, there is a clear change\n226 in the NCFs for both station pairs. Maximum cross correla-\n227 tions are reduced and the change in dv\/v suggests a small\n228 reduction in velocity of approximately 0.5%. Rayleigh\n229 waves with the observed periods of a few seconds are sen-\n230 sitive to velocities in the top few kms of the Earth\u2019s crust as\n231 well as any change in topography of the free surface. The\n232 strong reduction in the amplitude of the MBRY\u2010MBGB ZZ\n233NCF following the collapse is difficult to explain. This is\n234unlikely to be due to a change in sensor coupling since the\n235amplitude on the ZR and ZT components are unaffected.\n236[13] The lava dome collapse on 12 July 2003 resulted in\n237the removal of over 210 million m3 of dome material over a\n238period of 18 hours. This removed the core of the lava\n239approximately 300 m across and 400 m high [Herd et al.,\n2402005], along with a large expanse of talus that accounted\n241for more than 50% of the total dome volume. It is possible\n242that the significant change in topography following the col-\n243lapse could have resulted in a change in the characteristics of\n244surface waves propagating through the volcanic edifice.\n245However, the clear reduction in velocity could be more\n246closely related to the effect of the unloading of the lava dome\n247on the Earth\u2019s crust. Voight et al. [2006] suggest that the\n248reduction in mean lithostatic pressure resulting from the\n249collapse caused a rapid volumetric expansion in the magma\n250chamber and created measurable strains detected by dilat-\n251ometers. I suggest that a reduction in lithostatic pressure in\n252the rock\u2010mass below the volcanic edifice, could also result in\n253the opening of microcracks and pore space that would lead to\n254a corresponding reduction in seismic velocity [Dutta, 2002],\n255and that the computed NCFs are sensitive to this reduction.\n256[14] Interestingly, the NCFs do not appear to be sensitive\n257to any changes in volcanic behaviour before the collapse.\n258Intense seismic activity starting on 9 June [Ottem\u00f6ller, 2008]\n259preceded the dome collapse, suggest an increase in magma\n260pressure at shallow depths below the volcano. However,\n261there is no clear evidence of any change in the NCFs in the\n262few days prior to the collapse. The NCFs also remained\n263extremely stable throughout June 2003. While this obser-\n264vation does not preclude the use of NCFs for volcanic\n265monitoring, the detailed nature of the relationship between\n266NCFs and volcanic behaviour at the Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano\n267remains to be fully understood.\nFigure 4.
