INTRODUCTION 24 \nThe generation of higher harmonics of the tide by non-linear effects has been well 25 \nestablished in the literature, since the early work of Proudman in the 1960\u2019s.  Numerous 26 \nnumerical simulations of their spatial distributions in a range of shallow water regions have 27 \nbeen performed using finite difference models (e.g. for the Irish Sea region, Young et al 28 \n2000, Davies and Jones 1992, hereafter referenced as DJ92, Davies 1986, Davies et al. 2001, 29 \nJones 1983), although to date less work has been done with finite element models.  Recent 30 \nexamples of finite element work are Fortunato et al 1997, 1999, Henich et al 2000, Legrand 31 \net al (2006, 2007), Greenberg (2007) and references therein.  In addition Blanton et al (2004) 32 \nused a finite element model to examine the principal although not the higher harmonics of 33 \nthe tide in the South Atlantic Bight.  They found that even for the principal tides it was 34 \n 2 \nessential to have high resolution in the coastal region.  Since the higher harmonics are largest 1 \nand show greatest spatial variability in shallow water regions then maximum resolution in 2 \nthese areas is desirable.  Consequently an unstructured grid model with enhanced resolution 3 \nin the coastal region would appear to be the ideal tool to simulate these harmonics.  In the 4 \nfinite difference model, the need to use a uniform grid means that the model domain is 5 \ngenerally limited in order to have a fine mesh in the coastal region without excessive 6 \ncomputational effort.  A limited area coastal model therefore requires some description of 7 \nthe higher harmonics along its open boundary which is rather restrictive.  Consequently in a 8 \nsmall domain model, part of the solution has been specified through the open boundary (e.g. 9 \nJones and Davies 1996, hereafter referenced as JD96, Greenberg (2007)).  The alternative is 10 \nto use a large area model (e.g. the shelf wide model of Kwong et al 1997).  In this case there 11 \nis no input of higher harmonics through the open boundary, since these are in deep water.  12 \nHowever, the coarse grid nature of the model means that an accurate representation of the 13 \nnearshore region is not possible. 14 \nThe finite element model with its ability to vary the mesh (e.g. Henry and Walters 15 \n(1993), Luettich and Westerink (1995), Lynch et al (1995, 2004), Werner 1995, Malcherek 16 \n2000, Hervouet 2002, Jones 2002) , is able to cover a significant offshore region while 17 \nretaining a fine mesh near the coast.  By this means a computationally efficient solution is 18 \nobtained.  Although this means of grading the mesh, based on local water depth is popular in 19 \nmany shallow sea models (see Greenberg (2007) for a recent review of methods in oceanic 20 \nand coastal situations) it is not the only approach.  Recently Legrande et al (2006) developed 21 \na method in which both the bathymetric field and approximate distance to offshore features 22 \nsuch as islands and reefs could be included in the mesh generation algorithm.  This approach 23 \nwas very successful in generating an optimal mesh that could resolve tidal features and re-24 \ncirculating eddies in regions such as the Australian Great Barrier Reef.  A comparable, in the 25 \nsense of requiring a fine grid in the region of rapid change whilst minimizing computational 26 \neffort was given by Hagen et al (2002).  This Local Truncation Error Analysis (LTEA) 27 \napproach seeks to design a mesh to make the truncation error uniform across the whole 28 \ndomain.  Recent papers (Legrande et al 2007, Greenberg 2007) present a range of parameters 29 \nthat must be considered in the design of an optimal grid.  The importance of these 30 \nparameters varies depending upon grid location (e.g. shelf edge, shallow sea) and processes 31 \nto be modelled.  In the case of tidal processes Legrande et al (2007), suggest that a grid 32 \naligned with the major axis of the M2 tidal ellipse with anisotropy related to the major and 33 \nminor axis of the ellipse could be optimal.  This approach is very attractive, although in the 34 \n 3 \nIrish Sea example given in Legrand et al (2007) it did reduce grid resolution in near coastal 1 \nregions where higher harmonics are important.  Although other parameters could possibly 2 \nalso be included to enhance local resolution. 3 \nDespite this significant recent progress in grid design (see review of Greenberg 4 \n(2007)) it is clear that a major problem still remains, namely how should the grid be graded 5 \nfrom offshore to nearshore in order to obtain an accurate solution for both the fundamental 6 \nand higher harmonics.  In a more complex region such as the west coast of Britain where 7 \nthere are a number of channels (Fig. 1a, see Fig. 1b for details of topography in eastern Irish 8 \nSea) where \u201cwetting and drying\u201d can occur, with associated small scale changes in the 9 \nhigher tidal harmonics, and deep water regions adjacent to shallow (e.g. Irish Sea) the choice 10 \nof grid is complex.  Also measurements and coarse grid shelf wide models show that the M4 11 \ntide along the west coast of Britain increases from the shelf edge (where models (e.g. Davies 12 \n1986) assume it is zero) through the Celtic Sea with a subsequent decrease at the southern 13 \nend of the Irish Sea and increase in the eastern Irish Sea.  This spatial distribution is very 14 \ndifferent to that in a near coastal region or estuary where a uniform increase towards the 15 \ncoast or head of the estuary occurs.  The simulation of the complex M4 distribution that 16 \noccurs off the west coast of Britain therefore represents a good test of the ability of an 17 \nirregular grid model to adequately describe the tide and its higher harmonics.  Such a test is 18 \nperformed here.  In addition the existence of a solution from a high resolution finite 19 \ndifference eastern Irish Sea model, Fig. 2 (JD96) and a comprehensive data set in terms of 20 \ntidal observations and bottom topography in this nearshore region, means that the sensitivity 21 \nto grid resolution in the coastal domain can also be examined.  For this reason the area off 22 \nthe west coast of Britain with particular emphasis on the eastern Irish Sea is used here to 23 \nexamine the accuracy of a finite element code (TELEMAC) with a range of irregular grids, 24 \nto represent the fundamental constituent M2 and its higher harmonics. 25 \nThe primary objective of the paper is to develop an optimal irregular mesh finite 26 \nelement model of the tides along the west coast of Britain, with particular emphasis on the 27 \neastern Irish sea where a detailed (horizontal resolution of 1 km) topographic data set exists 28 \n(JD96).  The finite element distribution will be such that it can adequately describe the 29 \nfundamental tide, to such an extent that the higher harmonics can be accurately reproduced.  30 \nSince these are largest in near coastal regions then the mesh will be refined locally, 31 \nparticularly in the eastern Irish Sea, to allow for their correct reproduction.  The focus of the 32 \ncalculation will be the eastern Irish Sea, where the higher harmonics are significant and an 33 \n 4 \naccurate finite difference solution and associated data (JD96) exists for comparison 1 \npurposes.   2 \nThe present paper complements and extends an earlier paper (Jones and Davies 2007 3 \nhereafter JD07) where the focus was the influence of grid resolution upon tidal residual 4 \ncurrents.  In that paper by comparison with a published finite difference solution, it was 5 \nshown that the removal by using finite elements of artificial vorticity associated with the 6 \n\u201cstaircase\u201d representation of the coast in a finite difference model (Greenberg 2007), 7 \nsignificantly improved the representation of tidal residuals in the near coastal region.  In 8 \nessence in a finite difference model the poor representation of the coastline corrupted the 9 \ntidal residual within five grid boxes of the coast.  In addition JD07 examined the detailed 10 \ndistribution and convergence of the tidal residual within the Mersey estuary for a range of 11 \nlocally refined meshes in the estuary.  Calculations showed that there were significant gyres 12 \nat the entrance and within the Mersey, in the tidal residual current.  These gyres could only 13 \nbe reproduced by using a finite element grid that could resolve coastal and topographic 14 \nvariations within the Mersey.  Although these convergence studies gave significant insight 15 \ninto the role of mesh refinement, there were no tidal residual currents or elevations with 16 \nwhich comparisons could be made.  Also the focus of JD07 was a convergence study within 17 \nthe Mersey and the influence of coastal discretization method on the solution.  Due to a lack 18 \nof observations no model data comparisons were possible. 19 \nIn this paper the focus of the study is the influence of finite element resolution upon 20 \nhigher harmonics of the tide that are generated by non-linear effects and \u201cwetting and 21 \ndrying\u201d in the coastal region of the eastern Irish Sea.  Since extensive observational data sets 22 \nare available over the whole region, as are published results from a finite difference model, a 23 \ndetailed comparison with observations and comparable finite difference solutions are 24 \npossible.  The focus here is no longer limited to the Mersey estuary as in JD07, but rather to 25 \nspatial variability in a range of nearshore regions where observations are available.  This 26 \nspatial variability is illustrated in a number of figures and quantified in various tables. 27 \nThe basic hydrodynamic equations are described in the next section.  In subsequent 28 \nsections the influence of the nearshore coastal boundary, and finite element resolution, upon 29 \nthe higher harmonics are considered.  Conclusions as to an optimal form of the mesh and 30 \nsensitivity of the solution are presented in the final part of the paper. 31 \n2. HYDRODYNAMIC EQUATIONS 32 \n To examine the sensitivity of the tidal distribution to variations in horizontal grid 33 \nresolution, it is sufficient to solve the two dimensional vertically integrated hydrodynamic 34 \n 5 \nequations.  Since details are given in DJ92 and JD96 only the main features are presented 1 \nhere.  As the region spans a range of latitude, the hydrodynamic equations in spherical 2 \ncoordinates were used.  The model contains all the non-linear terms, including momentum 3 \nadvection and quadratic bottom friction with a friction coefficient k = 0.0025, an appropriate 4 \nvalue to use in a two dimensional model and consistent with DJ92. 5 \n Along the open boundaries (Fig. 1a) the M2 tidal elevation was specified, with higher 6 \nharmonics set to zero.  Consequently the higher harmonics were generated by the model 7 \ndynamics.  The input was identical to that used by DJ92.  In all calculations (Table 1a) the 8 \nsame tidal input was used although the finite element grid varied (Table 1b).  In the finite 9 \nelement calculations in which the grid was refined to give enhanced resolution in near 10 \ncoastal regions with coarser resolution offshore, the tidal input was interpolated to the new 11 \nopen boundary nodes.  Solutions were determined in all cases by integrating forward in time 12 \nover seven tidal cycles and harmonically analysing the final cycle to yield tidal amplitude 13 \nand phase for the M2, M4 and M6 constituents.   14 \nAll solutions were generated from initial conditions of zero elevation and motion at t 15 \n= 0.  At a closed boundary the normal component of velocity was set to zero.  In shallow 16 \nregions \u201cwetting and drying\u201d occurred over the tidal cycles.  As details of this are given in 17 \nJones and Davies (2005), (hereafter referenced as JD05) they will not be presented here.  18 \nThe approach is consistent with that used by JD96 in their finite difference model, and hence 19 \na comparison with that model is valid.  However the nearshore solution will be sensitive to 20 \nthe algorithm used to represent \u201cwetting and drying\u201d (Balzano 1998) and the nearshore 21 \nelement resolution (see later discussion).The horizontal gradient normal to the coast of 22 \nalongshore velocity was taken as zero, corresponding to perfect slip. 23 \n3. FINITE ELEMENT SOLUTION 24 \n3.1 Choice of grid 25 \n In a previous paper (JD05), the M2 tidal distribution over the west coast of Britain 26 \nwas computed with the finite element model using a range of meshes.  Calculations (JD05) 27 \nshowed that the optimal M2 tidal solution was obtained using a mesh refinement based on 28 \nwater depth such that the ratio between element size and (gh)\u00bd was constant.  This condition 29 \nhas been used by a number of authors (e.g. Henry and Walters (1993), see also references in 30 \nthe comprehensive review of Greenberg et al (2007) for other criteria and recent work by 31 \nHagan et al (2002) on the LTEA approach).  Calculations with both a zero and non-zero 32 \nwater depth at the coast were performed, with the non-zero depth yielding the most accurate 33 \nM2 solution at minimum computational cost (JD05).  Here we examine to what extent the 34 \n 6 \nhigher harmonics M4 and M6 are influenced by the use of a zero or non-zero coastal water 1 \ndepth.  Taking topography and eastern Irish Sea coastline from a 1 km model of this region 2 \n(Fig.2) (JD96) gave an optimal M2 tidal solution (JD05). 3 \n3.2 Calculation using a non-zero coastal water depth (Calc 1) 4 \nIn an initial calculation (Calc 1, Table 1a), the optimal grid (Grid G3AX (Fig. 3)) 5 \nused by JD05 was applied, with linear triangular elements and an advection scheme based on 6 \ncharacteristics.  Since a detailed comparison of the computed M2 cotidal chart (not shown 7 \nbut given in JD05) with measurements is given by JD05, only the major features will be 8 \nexamined here with comparisons at coastal and offshore gauges together with current meters 9 \nthat illustrate the major changes (Tables 2a,b).  A more detailed comparison in the eastern 10 \nIrish Sea is given in Table 3a.  The M2 cotidal chart is characterized by a rapid increase in 11 \ntidal amplitude in the eastern Irish Sea, and in the shallow channels such as the Bristol 12 \nChannel.  Within the North Channel the amphidromic point found in measurements (George 13 \n1980) and high resolution models of the region (Davies et al. 2001) has been displaced 14 \nslightly to the north.  However as discussed in Davies et al. (2004), tides in this region are 15 \nsensitive to small changes in the tidal distribution to the north and south of the North 16 \nChannel.  The amphidromic point in the western Irish Sea and the overall distribution of co-17 \namplitude and co-phase lines are in good agreement with co-tidal charts based on 18 \nobservations (e.g. Robinson 1979) and computed distributions derived from both two 19 \ndimensional (Jones 1983) and three dimensional (DJ92) models. 20 \nA detailed comparison (Table 3a) of computed and observed M2 tidal amplitude and 21 \nphase at identical points (Fig 2) in the eastern Irish Sea to those used in JD96 with their high 22 \nresolution (of order 1 km) eastern Irish Sea model, showed that the M2 tidal amplitude 23 \ndetermined with grid G3AX (Table 3a) was of the order of 15 cm too high.  The phase error 24 \nwas on average about 10\u00b0 too high.  This is an appreciably larger error than that found in 25 \nJD96 but can be understood in terms of differences in open boundary input to the models.  In 26 \nthe present model the open boundary forcing was located well away from the Irish Sea (Fig. 27 \n1a) in regions where the tidal distribution was not well known.  Consequently errors in 28 \nboundary forcing and tidal propagation into the Irish Sea due to a lack of detailed 29 \ntopography appear at offshore gauges S, T, U, V within the Eastern Irish Sea.  On average 30 \nthese errors were of the order of 25 cm in elevation and -15\u00b0 in phase (Table 3a).  On the 31 \nother hand the limited area model of the eastern Irish Sea (JD96) had very small errors at 32 \nthese offshore gauges, since the open boundary of this model was of limited extent and ran 33 \n 7 \nnorth-south through the Isle of Man, where the M2 tidal distribution was well known at 1 \ngauges S, T, U, V.  The errors in amplitude increase as the water depth shallows giving 2 \nerrors of order 30 cm at gauges Q, R in Liverpool Bay. 3 \nAt some coastal gauges for example Barrow (locations Y, Z and AA) there is 4 \nsignificantly more spatial variability in amplitude in the present model (Table 3a) than found 5 \nin the observations and in JD96.  Similarly at Morecambe and Fleetwood (locations BB, CC) 6 \namplitudes on grid G3AX tend to be below observed despite the fact that in offshore regions 7 \nthe tidal amplitude is too large.  To examine the reason for this in more detail it is necessary 8 \nto consider tidal spatial variability in the region of these locations.  This was accomplished, 9 \nusing values at nodal points close to the observation (Table 4a), where \u2206 is the distance 10 \nbetween the nodal point and observation. 11 \nConsider initially Hilbre Island, close to the entrance to the Mersey estuary.  At the 12 \nnearest nodal point located 1.1 km away in a water depth of 9.6 m, hc, gc are 321 cm and 13 \n309\u00b0, of order 30 cm too high and 10\u00b0 error in phase.  However, at an equivalent point in 14 \nshallower water (h = 2.0 m), hc, gc are 275 (cm) and 307\u00b0, of order 20 cm too low in 15 \namplitude, although with little change in phase.  At two other locations namely \u2206 = 1.3 km 16 \nand 1.8 km, similar variations in amplitude occur depending upon water depth.  These results 17 \nclearly show that at a near coastal location such as Hilbre there are significant variations in 18 \ntidal amplitude, of order 50 cm, over short distances comparable with the element resolution 19 \nof the model.  In addition these variations are linked to water depth suggesting that a detailed 20 \ndescription of nearshore topography is required. 21 \nIn coastal regions of more complex topographic variation where water depths are 22 \nbelow one metre, for example Barrow RI, the variation of tidal amplitude in locations close 23 \nto the observation point are more drastic.  At locations in close proximity (\u2206 = 1.0 km) to the 24 \nobservation point, there is significant \u201cwetting and drying\u201d over the tidal cycle, which 25 \ntogether with bottom frictional effects, appreciably reduces tidal magnitude (hc = 164 cm) 26 \ncompared with observations (ho = 306 cm) and nearby points which remain wet throughout 27 \nthe tidal cycle (hc = 324 cm).  At the majority of points there is little change in phase with 28 \nchange in \u2206.  At nearby locations, Barrow HP and Barrow HS the tidal amplitude shows 29 \nsimilar variations with water depth to that at Barrow RI with a major decrease where drying 30 \noccurs (Table 4a). 31 \nAt Morecambe, although drying does not occur at nearby points, the tidal amplitude 32 \nat locations adjacent to the observation point, namely points \u2206 = 0.6 km and \u2206 = 1.5 km from 33 \n 8 \nit show a variation in tidal amplitude from 298 cm to 322 cm, bracketing the observed value 1 \nof 308 cm.  This variation is large considering that water depth only varies from 3.0 m to 3.7 2 \nm at these two locations.  Slightly farther away, \u2206 = 2.0 km, amplitude decreases to 271 cm, 3 \nalthough again there is little change in water depth.  At a comparable point (\u2206 = 2.0 km) in 4 \nshallow water where drying can occur tidal amplitude is reduced to 214 cm.  It is interesting 5 \nthat there is little phase variation with the computed value of 325\u00b0 being in excellent 6 \nagreement with the observed 326\u00b0. 7 \nAt Fleetwood where the three nearest locations are in shallow water and drying 8 \noccurs, the tidal amplitude is below the observed value while slightly farther away (\u2206 = 2.3 9 \nkm) in deeper water (h = 9.6 m) the computed value exceeds the observed.  These 10 \ncalculations clearly show significant spatial variability in computed M2 tidal amplitude in the 11 \nnearshore region, over quite short distances, comparable with the finite element resolution. 12 \nThe computed M4 co-tidal chart (Fig. 4a), shows the M4 tidal elevation amplitude 13 \nincreasing over the Celtic Sea region, from an input value of zero along the open boundary 14 \nto a maximum of 12 cm in the southern part of the Irish Sea.  A subsequent decrease in the 15 \nwestern Irish Sea with a minimum to the west of the Isle of Man is evident in Fig. 4a.  This 16 \nincrease through the Celtic Sea and subsequent decrease is found in observations (Table 2b) 17 \nand in shelf wide numerical models (Davies 1986, Kwong et al. 1997).  A rapid increase in 18 \nelevation within the eastern Irish Sea as the water shallows is apparent in Fig. 4a and found 19 \nin observations (Table 3b).  At Douglas and Ramsay (locations C and J) the model slightly 20 \noverpredicts the M4 tidal amplitude (Table 3b).  However this overprediction is less than that 21 \nfound by JD96 in a high resolution model of the eastern Irish Sea.  In the nearshore region 22 \nparticularly around Barrow and Morecambe, the model shows a rapid increase in M4 tidal 23 \namplitude that is also found in the observations (Table 3b).  A more gradual change occurs 24 \nin the Liverpool Bay region with computed values in good agreement with observations.  25 \nThese comparisons clearly show that the irregular grid has sufficient resolution to accurately 26 \nrepresent the spatial variability of the tide in the offshore Celtic and Irish Sea regions.  In 27 \naddition the finer grid in the coastal region of the eastern Irish Sea can reproduce the rapid 28 \nincrease in the observed M4 tide in this area. 29 \nTo understand the reasons for the spatial variability of the M4 tidal elevation in the 30 \nnearshore region it is useful to examine its variation at a number of coastal gauges (Table 31 \n4b).  It is evident that at Hilbre the M4 tidal amplitude varies from 26 cm to 35 cm within 1.3 32 \nkm of the gauge, with an associated variation of water depth from 2.0 m to 16.2 m.  Also, 33 \n 9 \nthere is a significant variation in phase from 228\u00b0 to 146\u00b0, reflecting the shorter wavelength 1 \nof this component.  This variation was not found in the M2 tide where the wavelength was 2 \nmuch larger. 3 \nAt Barrow RI in the region where drying occurred (h less than 1.0 m) the tidal 4 \namplitude was over twice that observed, although there was good agreement in phase.  5 \nHowever, at deeper water locations, the amplitude was in good agreement with observations, 6 \nalthough not the phase (Table 4b).  At Barrow HP at locations close to the gauge where 7 \ndrying did not occur amplitude and phase were in good agreement with observations.  As 8 \npreviously when drying occurred the amplitude was overestimated.  Similarly at Barrow HS, 9 \namplitude agreed well with observations, although phase was underpredicted.  At 10 \nMorecambe and Fleetwood there was significant spatial variability within 2 km of the tide 11 \ngauge with amplitude increasing rapidly as the water shallowed. 12 \nThe computed M6 co-tidal chart, shows (Fig. 4b) a rapid increase in tidal amplitude 13 \nin shallow water regions due to an increase in bottom friction.  In the eastern Irish Sea there 14 \nis a gradual increase in the Liverpool Bay region as the water shallows.  However, farther 15 \nnorth off the coast of Cumbria the M6 tidal amplitude rapidly increases as the coast is 16 \napproached.  These spatial changes in M6 reflect the spatial variability in the bottom 17 \ntopography in these regions (Fig. 1b).  The spatial variability of computed M6 tidal elevation 18 \namplitude in the eastern Irish Sea is also found in the observations (Table 3c). 19 \nIt is evident from Table 3c, that at a number of shallow water locations the model 20 \ntends to overpredict the value of the M6 tidal elevation amplitude.  To understand the reason 21 \nfor this it is useful to examine its spatial variability (Table 4c).  As found previously for the 22 \nM4 component at Hilbre, the M6 tidal amplitude increases rapidly as the water shallows 23 \ngiving rise to a major overprediction of amplitude, although a reasonable phase value.  In 24 \ndeeper water the amplitude is still overpredicted with a large phase error.  However, at 25 \nBarrow RI in drying regions, the amplitude is only slightly overpredicted, whereas in deeper 26 \nwater the error increases, with a rapid change in phase over distances of the order of 1 km.  27 \nSimilar rapid changes in phase occur at Barrow HP, again with amplitude decreasing in 28 \nshallow water.  At Barrow HS the water depth in the region of the gauge varies from 5.4 m 29 \nto 8.0 m with no drying area.  Consequently amplitude and phase change gradually over the 30 \nregion (Table 4c). 31 \n 10 \nAt Morecambe and Fleetwood the M6 tidal amplitude is overpredicted at all locations 1 \nin the region of the gauge.  Also, the phase changes rapidly over short distances.  This 2 \nsuggests that the spatial variability of the M6 tide is under-resolved in the model. 3 \nThe computed M2 tidal ellipse distribution over the whole region (not presented) 4 \nshows near circular ellipses at the southern end of the Celtic Sea, changing to a rectilinear 5 \nflow aligned with the coastline in St. George\u2019s Channel.  Away from the coastal boundary, at 6 \nthe entrance to the Bristol Channel there is a region of near circular current ellipses.  A 7 \nrectilinear flow aligned with the channel axis is evident in the North Channel.  Within the 8 \ncentral Irish Sea to the west of the Isle of Man, a region of near zero tidal currents is 9 \napparent.  This distribution of tidal currents is in good agreement with measurements (Table 10 \n5a, also see JD05) and results from a uniform grid finite difference model of the west coast 11 \nof Britain (DJ92).  Although the tidal currents in the region exhibit some vertical variation, 12 \nthis is primarily due to frictional effects in the near bed region (JD96).  Consequently 13 \ncurrents above this region (i.e. those in Tables 5a-c and 6) are not appreciably different from 14 \nthe depth mean derived by averaging observed current in the vertical.  The M2 tidal current 15 \nellipses within the eastern Irish Sea are aligned in a west-east direction, with an area of 16 \nreduced current strength to the east of the Isle of Man (Fig. 5a(i)).  The distribution of M2 17 \ncurrent ellipses in the eastern Irish Sea is in good agreement with a limited area high 18 \nresolution finite difference model of the region given by JD96 and observations (Table 5a).  19 \nThe enhanced mesh resolution that can be achieved with the finite element model in the 20 \neastern Irish Sea is evident in the distribution of current ellipses in the expanded plot of this 21 \nregion shown in Fig. 5a(i).  The enhanced resolution in the nearshore and estuarine regions 22 \n(Fig. 5a(i)) which is possible with the finite element mesh gives significantly more detail 23 \nthan that presented in JD96.  For example in the Solway (Fig. 5a(i)) the rapid decrease in 24 \ncurrent magnitude and change of orientation of the ellipse is resolved significantly better 25 \nthan in JD96.  Similarly the higher resolution in Morecambe Bay enables the spatial 26 \nvariability in magnitude and orientation of the M2 current ellipses to be resolved to a greater 27 \naccuracy than in JD96.  A significant improvement in resolution in the Liverpool Bay region 28 \n(Fig. 5a(ii)) above that used by JD96, enables the rapid increase in magnitude and orientation 29 \nof tidal currents in the Mersey entrance to be resolved in the model.  In JD96 the Liverpool 30 \nBay region was significantly under-resolved even with a 1 km horizontal grid.  In terms of 31 \nrecent measurements at a coastal observatory in the region (Proctor and Howarth 2003) high 32 \naccuracy in this region is essential to understand the dynamic interactions between Liverpool 33 \nBay and the Mersey River.   34 \n 11 \nThe spatial distribution of the major and minor axis of the M4 tidal current ellipse 1 \nover the whole region (not presented) shows that in deep water regions these tidal currents 2 \nare small.  However, in coastal regions particularly in the vicinity of headlands, the non-3 \nlinear advective terms lead to a significant generation of M4 currents.  The rapid increase in 4 \nM4 tidal current magnitude and enhanced spatial variability in the near coastal region of the 5 \neastern Irish Sea is clearly evident in Fig. 5b(i).  This spatial variability in amplitude of M4 6 \ntidal currents and ellipse orientation is comparable to that found by JD96 in the region and in 7 \ngood agreement with observations (Table 5b).  Since the M4 generation is primarily in the 8 \nnearshore and estuarine regions then the enhanced resolution which is possible in these areas 9 \nwith the finite element grid is more important for M4 than M2. 10 \nAn expanded plot of the Solway region (not presented) clearly shows an increase in 11 \nM4 currents in the region where the orientation of the estuary changes from north-south to 12 \nwest-east.  In this area the M2 tidal currents are strong and there is a rapid change in their 13 \norientation which through the non-linear momentum advection term leads to a local 14 \nmaximum in the M4 ellipse.  To the south of this region and near the head of the estuary 15 \nwhere M2 tidal currents are weaker and do not change direction, the M4 tidal currents are 16 \nreduced. 17 \nIn Morecambe Bay it is evident (Fig. 5a(i)) that the M2 tidal currents increase 18 \ntowards the head of the Bay, and then rapidly decrease due to bottom friction in the shallow 19 \nnear coastal regions at the top of the bay.  Associated with this variation in tidal current 20 \nmagnitude is a change in orientation of the current ellipse, which gives rise to the M4 current 21 \ndistribution shown in Fig. 5b(i).  The level of detail presented here is a significant 22 \nimprovement on that given in JD96. Similarly in Liverpool Bay (Fig. 5b(ii)), the enhanced 23 \nresolution in the near coast region which is present in the finite element mesh enables the 24 \nnear coastal generation of the M4 tide to be accurately resolved, whereas in JD96, the 25 \nLiverpool Bay region adjacent to the Mersey River was barely resolved.   26 \nThe spatial distribution of M6 current ellipses over the whole domain (not presented) 27 \nclearly shows that these currents are negligible in deep water offshore regions, and only 28 \nbecome important close to the coast.  The plot of M6 tidal currents in the eastern Irish Sea 29 \nshows (Fig. 5c(i)) significant spatial variability in current magnitude and orientation in this 30 \nregion comparable to that found by JD96, and in reasonable agreement with observations in 31 \nthe region (Table 5c).  The higher resolution made possible by the use of a finer mesh 32 \n(compared to JD96) in the near coastal region allows nearshore details to be resolved to a 33 \ngreater degree than previously.  The significant improvement compared to JD96 in nearshore 34 \n 12 \nresolution resulting from using the finite element mesh is clearly evident in the Solway 1 \nestuary and Morecambe Bay (Fig. 5c(i)).  This figure shows that as for the M4 tide, the M6 2 \ntidal current is also a maximum in shallow water.  However, the region of maximum M6 tidal 3 \ncurrents does not correspond to that found for the M4 tide.  This is because bottom frictional 4 \neffects are a major source of the M6 component of the tide, rather than the non-linear 5 \nmomentum term.  Consequently the M6 tidal current increases as water depth decreases and 6 \nM2 tidal velocity increases giving rise to enhanced bottom friction.  This explains the 7 \nincrease in M6 currents as water depth decreases, with a subsequent decrease as M2 tidal 8 \ncurrents are reduced in very shallow water.  Although the calculations of JD96 indicated this 9 \nbehaviour they could not resolve M6 tidal currents to the level of detail shown in Figs. 5c(i).  10 \nSimilarly in the Liverpool Bay\/Mersey region the rapid increase in M6 tidal currents at the 11 \nmouth of the river Mersey (Fig. 5c(ii)) could not be resolved by JD96.   12 \nIt is apparent from Table 5a (Calc 1), that at some locations, for example Rig Nos. 13 \n15, 16 and 23, the computed M2 tidal current amplitude is significantly overestimated.  The 14 \nreason for this can be understood in terms of the significant spatial variability of M2 currents 15 \nin the vicinity of these observations (Table 6).  For example at Rig 15, Ac changes from 44 16 \ncm s-1 to 30 cm s-1 (in essence bracketing the observed value of 37 cm s-1) as \u2206 varies from 17 \n2.2 km to 4.0 km (Table 6).  Similarly at Rig 16, as \u2206 increases from 1.0 km to 3.7 km, Ac 18 \ndecreases from 40 cm s-1 to 37 cm s-1 (a value in good agreement with observations).  A 19 \nsignificantly larger change occurs at Rig 23, with Ac decreasing from 68 cm s-1 to 41 cm s-1 20 \nas \u2206 changes from 0.9 km to 2.6 km. 21 \nThe computed M4 tidal currents are appreciable (exceed 10 cm s-1) at locations 18, 24 22 \nand 32 (Table 5b).  A similar increase in M4 tidal currents in these regions was found in 23 \nJD96.  This suggests that despite differences in grid size and approach (finite element, 24 \ncompared with finite difference JD96) the offshore variability of M4 tidal currents is being 25 \nreproduced in both finite element and finite difference models.  To examine to what extent 26 \nlocal spatial variability influences the M4 tidal current amplitude, both a deep water (location 27 \n6) and a nearshore (location 18) point are examined (Table 6).  It is evident that at Posn. 6, in 28 \ndeep water (h = 53 m) there is only limited spatial variability in the magnitude (Ac) and 29 \norientation (Tc) of the semi-major axis.  However, at Posn. 18 in shallow water ho = 3 m, Ac 30 \nvaries from 25.2 cm s-1 to 11.8 cm s-1 bracketing the observed value of 21.9 cm s-1, with Tc 31 \nvarying from 56\u00b0 to 100\u00b0 (To = 64\u00b0).  As with the elevation comparisons this suggests a lack 32 \nof resolution in the near coastal region. 33 \n 13 \nThe M6 tidal currents (Table 5c) are on average small (of order 3 cm s-1).  The local 1 \nintensification at positions 24 and 32 was also found by JD96 and DJ92.  On average values 2 \ngiven in Table 5c were larger than those found by JD96 and more comparable to the M2 3 \ncalculation of DJ92.  As pointed out in JD96 the use of a larger set of tidal constituents, 4 \nnamely M2, S2, N2, K1, O1 as in JD96 and DJ92 tended to reduce the M6 current magnitude 5 \nand probably explains its overprediction in the present calculation. 6 \nA detailed study (Table 6) of the spatial variability of M6 currents in the Morecambe 7 \nBay region from deeper water (Posn. 23, ho = 20 m) (Fig. 1b) to nearshore Posns. 24 and 32, 8 \nshowed significant spatial variability in the nearshore region for example at Posn. 24 as \u2206 9 \nchanged from 1.3 km to 1.5 km, Ac decreased from 9.1 cm s-1 to 3.6 cm s-1, although the 10 \nellipse orientation Tc and water depth varied very little.  Similarly at Posn. 32, as \u2206 changed 11 \nfrom 1.6 km to 1.7 km, Ac increased from 3.5 cm s-1 to 14.2 cm s-1 with Tc varying from 59\u00b0 12 \nto 122\u00b0, associated with a reduction in water depth from 11 m to 5 m.  This again suggests 13 \nrapid spatial variability in the nearshore region with associated implications for model 14 \nelement resolution and the need for detailed topography.  Results from this calculation 15 \nclearly show the importance of high resolution in the near coastal regions in order to 16 \naccurately resolve the higher harmonics of the tide. 17 \n3.3. Calculation using a zero coastal water depth (Calc 2, Grid G3A) 18 \nIn a subsequent calculation (Calc 2, Table 1a) the same criterion used for mesh 19 \ngeneration as in Calc 1 was applied.  However, in order to generate a fine nearshore grid (Fig 20 \n6, Grid G3A) a zero water depth condition was applied at the coast.  As shown by JD05 this 21 \napproach lead to a less accurate M2 tidal solution than previously, and a significantly longer 22 \nrun time than in Calc 1 (Table 1b) due to increased \u201cwetting and drying\u201d occurring in the 23 \ncoastal region.  Although the overall solution was less accurate, in offshore regions the M2 24 \ntide was not substantially different to that found in Calc 1.  Major differences that occurred 25 \nwere principally confined to the near coastal regions, in particular in the eastern Irish Sea 26 \nand to higher harmonics of the tide.  Consequently in order to determine differences in the 27 \nhigher harmonics between Calcs 1 and 2 we will concentrate on the eastern Irish Sea.  This 28 \nregion has the added advantage that a high resolution finite difference solution already exists 29 \n(JD96) with associated observations that can be used in the comparisons.  In addition an 30 \noptimal graded mesh is required in this region to complement a coastal observatory. 31 \nIt is evident from Table 3a, that M2 tidal amplitudes computed with grid G3A (Calc 32 \n2) are on average lower than those derived with grid G3AX (Calc 1) reflecting increased 33 \n 14 \nenergy loss in the shallow water regions that are resolved on this grid.  This not only affects 1 \ncoastal gauges, but offshore locations Q, R, S, T, U, V within the eastern Irish Sea.  2 \nAlthough the amplitude changes significantly, there is a minor phase change, of order one or 3 \ntwo degrees (Table 3a). 4 \nAs in Calc 1, there is an appreciable change in amplitude, although not phase of the 5 \nM2 tide in shallow water locations such as Hilbre, Barrow, Morecambe and Fleetwood 6 \nassociated with small changes in \u2206 (Table 4a).  Since grid G3A resolves the near coastal 7 \nregion, at a number of locations water depths are below 1 m, and extensive \u201cwetting and 8 \ndrying\u201d occurs with an associated decrease in tidal amplitude (Table 4a). 9 \nAt offshore locations Q, R, S, T, U, V the M4 tidal amplitude is reduced slightly from 10 \nthat found previously, with a 10\u00b0 reduction in phase (compare Calcs 1 and 2) in Table 3b.  11 \nFor tidal amplitude this improves the agreement with observations, particularly at Q and R, 12 \nalthough not the phase.  At coastal locations the M4 tidal amplitude is in general significantly 13 \noverpredicted as a result of \u201cwetting and drying\u201d occurring at the nearest nodal point to the 14 \ngauge due to the increased resolution in the nearshore region.  The effect of \u201cwetting and 15 \ndrying\u201d upon M4 tidal amplitude, and how this influences spatial variability is clearly evident 16 \nin Table 4b.  For example at Hilbre, M4 amplitude changes from 17 cm to 22 cm as \u2206 17 \nincreases from 0.6 km to 1.0 km, bracketing the observed value of 20 cm.  With \u2206 = 1.2 km, 18 \nwater depth drops below 1 m, and \u201cwetting and drying\u201d occurs with an associated increase in 19 \namplitude to 66 cm (Table 4b).  Similarly at Barrow RI, HP and HS in shallow wet\/dry 20 \nregions M4 amplitude exceeds 60 cm, whereas in water depths of order 10 m, its value is 21 \nabout 14 cm.  This value is considerably lower than the observed and computed (Calc 1) 22 \nvalues of order 30 cm (28 cm computed) (Barrow RI) and 26 cm (28 cm computed) (Barrow 23 \nHP) found in Calc 1 in comparable water depths.  This suggests, as found for the M2 tide, 24 \nthat the inclusion of extensive wetting\/drying regions has removed significant tidal energy.  25 \nA similar picture emerges at Morecambe and Fleetwood with large M4 tidal amplitudes in 26 \nwet\/dry regions and underpredicted values in deeper water. As previously (Calc 1) in non-27 \nwet\/dry regions the M6 amplitude is larger than observed (Table 3c) with on average a 28 \nsignificant reduction in areas where drying occurs.  The effect of the finer grid is to 29 \nintroduce appreciably larger spatial variability over shorter distances than found in Calc 1 30 \n(Table 4c). 31 \nThe \u201cwetting\/drying\u201d algorithm used here has been specifically chosen to be 32 \nconsistent with that used by JD96 in their finite element calculations.  However a range of 33 \n 15 \nmethods exists in the literature (see the review of Balzano 1998).  Naturally different 1 \napproaches combined with different methods of choosing mesh refinement in near coastal 2 \nregions will affect the solution in these regions.  Such a detailed study is however outside the 3 \nscope of this paper. 4 \nThe main features of the distribution of M2 tidal current ellipses in the eastern Irish 5 \nSea (not shown) are comparable to those found previously (Fig. 5a(i)).  However, it is 6 \nevident that in the near coastal region the use of a zero water depth condition gives rise to 7 \nincreased resolution close to the coast.  In this region the water is shallow, and the resulting 8 \nincrease in bottom friction leads to a reduced M2 tidal current at nodes adjacent to a coastal 9 \nboundary (not shown).  This effect could be clearly seen in a comparison of expanded plots 10 \nof the Solway Firth, Morecambe Bay (not presented) and Liverpool Bay\/Mersey River (Fig. 11 \n7a) compared with M2 tidal ellipses computed with Grid G3AX.  However, away from the 12 \nnearshore region there were no substantial differences in the M2 tidal currents, as is evident 13 \nfrom Table 4a. 14 \nSimilarly for the M4 component of the tide, differences between solutions using 15 \nGrids G3AX and G3A (Calcs 1 and 2) were only evident in near coastal regions.  From a 16 \ncomparison of solutions in the Solway (not shown) and Morecambe Bay (not shown) it is 17 \nevident that in near coastal areas M4 tidal currents computed with grid G3AX (non-zero 18 \nwater depth at the coast) were slightly larger than those computed with grid G3A (zero water 19 \ndepth at the coast).  This arises because in G3A, the nearshore M2 tidal current has been 20 \nreduced and hence the generation of an M4 current is also reduced. 21 \nThis effect is clearly evident in the Liverpool Bay region, where the nearshore M4 22 \ncurrent ellipses computed with mesh G3A (Fig. 7b) in the near coastal region (e.g. along the 23 \nWelsh coast to the west of the Dee estuary) are appreciably smaller than those computed 24 \nwith mesh G3AX (Fig. 5b(ii)).  Also slightly farther offshore (e.g. at 53.4\u00b0, -3.35\u00b0W) there 25 \nare some differences in current magnitudes and ellipse orientation.  This suggests that for the 26 \nM4 tide the influence of coastal water depth is not just confined to nodal points in the 27 \nnearshore region, but does spread some way offshore. 28 \nAs previously the M6 tidal current is mainly affected by differences in the G3AX and 29 \nG3A mesh in the near coast region.  This is clearly evident in the upper reaches of the 30 \nSolway (not shown) where the region of M6 currents exceeding 25 cm s-1 has been reduced 31 \ncompared to that computed with grid G3AX, due to a decrease in M2 tidal currents through 32 \nfriction effects.  However farther south in a deeper central channel at about 54.9\u00b0N, -3.5\u00b0W, 33 \n 16 \nand in the deeper water regions to the south of this, there is a slight increase in M6 current 1 \nbetween grid G3A and G3AX.  The reason for this is not obvious, but is in part related to the 2 \nfact that changes in grid representation in the neashore region as in the M4 case do influence 3 \nnodal solutions farther offshore. 4 \nThe increase in M6 currents within the Moricambe Bay (approximate location 5 \n54.9\u00b0N, -3.3\u00b0W) region of the Solway (not shown) compared to that computed with grid 6 \nG3AX, reflects the increase in \u201cwetting and drying\u201d in this region due to the shallower near 7 \ncoast water depths in G3A compared to G3AX .  The harmonic analysis of a time series in 8 \nwhich \u201cstep like transitions\u201d have occurred due to \u201cwetting and drying\u201d gives rise to a 9 \n\u201cGibbs type\u201d phenomenon (Hall and Davies 2004) which leads to an increase in amplitude 10 \nof the higher harmonics. 11 \nDifferences in M6 tidal currents are also evident in Morecambe Bay (not shown), 12 \nparticularly in the shallow northern part where the reduction in near coastal water depths in 13 \ngrid G3A, leads to a reduction in M6 tidal currents compared to G3AX.  However, as in the 14 \nSolway, in some shallow embayments (e.g. at location -54\u00b0N, -2.9\u00b0W), M6 currents 15 \ncomputed with grid G3A are larger than G3AX due to wetting and drying. 16 \nDifferences in the near coastal and adjacent offshore M6 currents in the Liverpool 17 \nBay region between grids G3A and G3AX are evident from a comparison between Figs 7c 18 \nand 5c(ii).  This is consistent with the differences in the M4 solutions and confirms that the 19 \ninfluence of changes in representing coastal water depths affects the nearshore distribution of 20 \nthe higher harmonics. 21 \n The influence of differences in grid G3A compared with grid G3AX upon spatial 22 \nvariability of M2 currents in the region of offshore current meters (Table 6) for example Rigs 23 \n15 and 16, is small, and less than the differences found between nearest nodes, namely 24 \nwithin the model\u2019s resolution.  At shallower near coastal locations, for example Rig 23, 25 \n(Table 6) at the nearest point to the observation (\u2206 = 0.7 km) the computed value using G3A 26 \nis in good agreement with the observed and significantly more accurate than found with 27 \nG3AX.  Similarly at \u2206 = 2.5 km the magnitude although not the orientation is in better 28 \nagreement on grid G3A than G3AX.  This suggests that for the M2 tidal currents the 29 \nenhanced resolution in the near coastal region due to using G3A improves the solution. 30 \n For the M4 tidal current in deeper water, namely location 6 (Table 6), the improved 31 \ngrid resolution using G3A leads to enhanced accuracy.  In shallow regions namely Rig 18 32 \n 17 \nthe solution shows similar spatial variability to that found with grid G3AX, suggesting that 1 \nthe grid is still not sufficiently fine to resolve small scale variations in M4 tidal currents. 2 \n For M6, as for the elevation, the current amplitude is on average significantly higher 3 \nthan observed (Table 6) and shows appreciable nearshore variability as indicated at current 4 \nmeters at the entrance to Morecambe Bay (Rig 23) and within the Bay (Rigs 24 and 32).  5 \nThe spatial variability in this region using grid G3A is comparable to that using G3AX and 6 \nsuggests that neither has sufficient resolution to represent the small scale variability of M6 in 7 \nthis region. 8 \n4. CONCLUDING REMARKS 9 \n A west coast unstructured grid model covering the same region as the finite 10 \ndifference model of DJ92 with enhanced resolution in the eastern Irish Sea, comparable to 11 \nthat of JD96, has been used to examine the sensitivity of the M2, M4 and M6 tides to 12 \nvariations in the finite element mesh.  Comparisons with observational data particularly in 13 \nthe eastern Irish Sea and with results from JD96 using a uniform mesh eastern Irish Sea 14 \nmodel have been made. 15 \n Initial results using grid G3AX in which the nearshore water depth was taken as non-16 \nzero, showed that an accurate distribution of the M2, M4, and M6 tide could be obtained 17 \nthroughout the region.  By refining the mesh within the eastern Irish Sea, a solution 18 \ncomparable to the limited area high resolution model of JD96 could be obtained even though 19 \na coarse mesh was used outside this region in deeper water.  Despite the coarser nature of the 20 \nmesh in the deeper Celtic Sea region the model could reproduce the observed spatial 21 \nvariability of the tide in this region. 22 \n Calculations using grid G3A, where water depths were zero at the coast, showed that 23 \nin deeper water the tide changed very little, although in coastal regions there were some 24 \nslight modifications particularly to the distribution of the higher harmonics.  However as 25 \nshown by JD05 on average for the M2 tide the solution was not as accurate as using grid 26 \nG3AX and the computational effort was significantly larger.  For this reason a non-zero 27 \ncoastal water depth was the optimum choice when computing the fundamental and higher 28 \nharmonics.  The calculations presented here using grid G3AX are presently being extended 29 \nto the simulation of storm surges and comparison with corresponding finite difference 30 \nsolutions.  Results of this intercomparison will be reported in due course. 31 \n  32 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 33 \n 18 \n The origin of the TELEMAC SYSTEM is EDF-LNHE and is therefore \u00a9 EDF-1 \nLNHE.
