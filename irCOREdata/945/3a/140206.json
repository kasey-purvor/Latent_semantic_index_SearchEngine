INTRODUCTION\nThe globalisation of commercial and industrial activities is symptom of increasing levels of\ncollaboration between individual enterprises, examples of these may include supply chains, business\nprocess outsourcing, collaborative product development and so on. The motivation for each individual\nenterprise comes not from the fact that they want to collaborate but from the fact that there are\neconomic advantages to be gained through collaboration. With this focus on collaboration one of the\nkey issues at the forefront of any chief executive's mind are the questions \"how best to mange the\ncollaborative enterprise?\u201d and \u201chow the individual enterprises operating within the framework of a\ncollaborative enterprise should be managed?\u201d.\nPrevious research in strategic, production and operations management developed models and\nframeworks to allow us to better-manage single enterprises [Porter M. 1985, Richardson 1985 and\nTreacy and Wiersema 1996, Bititci and Turner, 1999]. The research question \"what to manage and how\nto manage the performance of collaborative\/extended enterprises\u201d remains largely unanswered. In this\npaper we try to add to this vast body of literature by answering the following set of questions:\n1. What is it that we should be managing? - In tackling this question we will take an internal, i.e.\nresource based, view of the extended organisation to rationalise the cybernetic structure of the\nextended organisation that creates value\n2. How should we be managing it? - In tackling this question we will take both an internal, i.e.\nextended processed based view, and an external, i.e. market based view, to the extended\nenterprise\n3In tackling these questions, the paper integrates a number of existing concepts and it demonstrates that\nlike all businesses, extended enterprises also have a common, cybernetic structure that needs to be\nmanaged. This paper makes a contribution by:\n1. Making the complex structure of collaborative enterprises explicit from two points of view:\na. From the point of view of the extended enterprise\nb. From the point of view of the individual enterprise who has to manage its participation in\none or more collaborative\/extended enterprises\n2. Proposing a management systems architecture that would facilitate efficient and effective\nmanagement of the collaborative enterprise from both of the viewpoints described above.\n3. Outlining a requirements specification for management systems that would support the above\narchitecture.\n4. It also raises further research questions on the management of the collaborative\/extended enterprise.\nFrom the methodological perspective, this paper presents two distinctive sections: theory-building and\ntheory-testing. In the theory-building phase the authors\u2019 experiences in the previous research projects\nand with certain industries led them look at literature. In particular the trends in manufacturing and\nbusiness were examined. Consequently, theory was built up on a pre-understanding based on personal\nexperience, which was then backed up by literature as presented on this paper. The theory developed\nwas then tested through a single but in depth case study. The case data was collected through a series of\nsemi-structured interviews and workshops with the management team of the case study organisation.\n42. BACKGROUND\nThe background of the work presented here extends back to the earlier work done by the Centre for\nStrategic Manufacturing on Integrated Performance Measurement Systems and The Competitive\nBusiness structure.\nThe objective of the original R&D programme we embarked on during 1995 was to analyse the\nliterature in the field of performance measurement, study practices of companies considered good\npractice and consolidate the lessons learned into a reference model for integrated performance\nmeasurement systems. This original objective was achieved; a reference model of integrated\nperformance measurement systems and an audit methodology were developed. The results of this work\nhave been published in several academic and practitioner journals [Bititci and Carrie 1998, Bititci and\nTurner 1999, Bititci 2000a].\nIn conducting the above research, our research team analysed numerous literature covering\nperformance measurement, strategic management, operations management, financial management and\nbusiness process management. The team also studied the practices of companies worth looking at,\nincluding European Business Excellence Prize Winners and others (such as Texas Instruments, HP,\nRank Xerox, Nortel, TNT and so on). As a result of this initial research, the team developed a list of\ngood and bad practices for performance measurement.\nThe next task was to present these factors in a structured and logical manner to create a Reference\nModel. In order to achieve this objective, the researchers investigated a number of existing models and\nframeworks covering areas, such as Hard Systems, Soft Systems, Systems Dynamics and Cybernetics.\nFinally, the research team identified that CIM-OSA business process architecture [Childe et al ,1994\n5and 1995, ESPRIT Consortium AMICE, 1991] together with Porters Value Chain Model [Porter, 1985]\nand Beer's Viable Systems Model (VSM) [Beer S. 1985] complemented one another, and that their\nintegration would provide a powerful structure (Figure 1) for planning and managing today\u2019s modern\norganisation [Bititci and Turner 1999]. The researchers called this structure the Viable Business\nStructure (or the Competitive Business Structure) as it represented the cybernetic structure of the\norganisation irrespective of how it was actually organised.\nIn essence this work has described the competitive structure of any business which needs to be\nmanaged. This structure, which is illustrated in Figure 1b, may be summarised as:\n\uf0b7 The business exists to create wealth for its shareholder (or satisfy expectations of its key\nstakeholders).\n\uf0b7 It achieves this by operating one or more business units that need to remain competitive in their\nselected markets in order to satisfy the needs of the business. Here a Business Unit is defined as the\nlogical part of the business, which exists to service a particular market sector with specific\ncompetitive requirements. In our experience Business Units may be product oriented or market\noriented. In a product-oriented business unit, it is the design characteristic of the product or product\ngroup, which determines how the product competes in that market sector. In a market-oriented\nbusiness unit the same product may be subjected to different competitive pressures in different\nmarkets. For a more in-depth explanation on the definition of business units refer to Bititci and\nTurner 1999.\n6\uf0b7 Each business unit competes by operating a number of value-add processes supported by the support\nprocesses. The efficiency and effectiveness of these processes determines the competitiveness of the\nbusiness units.\n\uf0b7 The efficiency and effectiveness of each business process is determined by the combined\nperformance of its critical activities.\nThe management implication of this is that, in order to create and sustain competitive advantage for\none enterprise, we need to manage this structure\u2026 but how does this theory apply in the case of\nextended enterprises where collaborative systems are required to co-ordinate and synchronise the\nactivities of a number of enterprises?\nValue\nGet Order\nDevelop Product\nFulfil Order\nSupport Product\nSet\nD\nirection\nForm\nulate\nStrategies\nD\nirect\nB\nusiness\nM\nan\nag\ne\nFi\nna\nnc\ne\nSu\npp\nor\nt\nPe\nrs\non\nne\nl\nM\nan\nag\ne\nT\nec\nhn\nol\nog\ny\nC\nor\npo\nra\nte\nL\nea\nrn\nin\ng\nManage\nProcesses\nOperate\nProcesses\nSupport\nProcesses\na.

TRENDS IN MANUFACTURING AND BUSINESS: COMPETING IN THE 21ST CENTURY\nIn order to understand \"what to manage\" and \"how to manage it\", it is necessary to understand some of\nthe trends over the 80s, the 90s and into the new millennium. Table 1, which is based on UK's\ntechnology foresight [DTI, 1998] exercise which was then adapted by Bititci [2000b], illustrates these\ntrends. The foresight exercise was based on an extensive Delphi study involving UK manufacturing\npractitioners and academics.

MANAGING PERFORMANCE\nIn this section we will explore the need for an integrated, dynamic and agile strategy and performance\nmanagement process to facilitate the management of the collaborative enterprise. Literature relating to\nstrategic and performance management of collaborative and extended enterprises are scarce. The\nSupply Chain Models such as SCOR [www.supply-chain.org] and CPFR [www.cpfr.com] are well\nunderstood and used but they are too operational and focus on supply chain management rather than\ncollaborative enterprises, which by definition is much broader. For this reason, in this section we will\nfirst examine the nature of the strategy and performance management in single enterprises and\nextrapolate the need for a dynamic and agile strategy and performance management process in\ncollaborative enterprises.\nIn the context of business processes, we have already demonstrated earlier in this paper that the\noperate-processes create competitive advantage. However, it is the manage-processes which create and\nsustain competitive advantage. There are several examples of how manage-processes enable companies\nto \u201cmaintain and develop a winning business formula\u201d or \u201cidentify and change to a new business\nformula\u201d.\nWe do not need to look too far to see evidence in support of this proposition. Examples of how\nmanage-processes enable companies to \u201cmaintain and develop a winning business formula\u201d or\n\u201cidentify and change to a new business formula\u201d include:\n\uf0b7 TNT's and DHL's history provides excellent examples where the manage processes successfully\nmaintained a winning formula and developed this formula to create further competitive advantage.\nBoth of these enterprises started with providing a reliable parcel delivery service. However, today\n10\nboth of these enterprises offer far more than a parcel delivery service. They provide an integrated\nlogistics support solution. Today, their clients do no longer use them as a parcel delivery service;\nthey outsource their logistics and transportation management processes to DHL and TNT. Here it is\nclear that, the management teams in these organisations, having recognised a winning formulae\nsuccessfully developed this formulae to sustain and develop their competitive advantage in a\nparticular direction, through efficient and effective manage processes, i.e. setting identifying\ndevelopment opportunities, setting direction and managing change.\n\uf0b7 Tesco, a UK based Supermarket Chain, recently re-deployed their Balanced Scorecard within days\nof Wal-Mart\u2019s takeover of Asda (one of their primary competitors), demonstrating real agility in\ntheir ability to react to an external change. By redeploying their Balanced Scorecard Tesco revised\nits objectives and deployed a strategy to deal with this new threat. This suggests that the manage\nprocesses which sets the strategic direction and objectives and ensures that the operational\nprocesses are managed to change in that direction were able to react quickly to external change.\n\uf0b7 Highland Spring were in the business of producing and selling commodity bottled water with no\nreal business success. In 1992 they adopted a brand management value proposition and focused on\ndeveloping the brand. As a result, they are one of the most successful mineral water companies in\nthe UK. In this case, the management team at Highland Spring have recognised that the previous\nbusiness model was under threat and chose to adopt a new business model based on brand value.\nThat is, through their manage processes have identified and changed to a winning business formula.\n\uf0b7 ICI [Turner, 1998], demonstrated the ability of their manage processes to recognise the need for\nradical change, identify and effectively deploy a new business model. As a result, they changed\n11\nfrom manufacturing and selling explosives to their customers (quarry operators) to providing a\n\u201crock on the ground service\u201d. Here, the quarry operators would use the explosives to blow up large\nhills into rocks which would then be used to manufacture gravel. The new business model used\nmobile manufacturing units that would manufacture the explosive on customers site, ICI\u2019s experts\nwould then administer the explosive and manage the explosion. Now the customers are no longer\nbuying explosives, they are buying a service that gives them \u201crock on the ground\u201d.\nIn the literature [Childe et al, 1994 and 1995] it is stated that \u2018Manage Processes relate specifically to\nbusiness direction and strategy as well as business planning and control\u2019. Others also attempted to place\nthe tools of strategy management within an overall process model for the whole company. The work\ncarried out by Pearce and Robinson [1988] and Wheelen and Hunger [1980] also offers a perspective\non strategy management where manage processes are central to creation of competitive advantage. In\ntheir model the firm\u2019s strategy acts so to maintain an acceptable performance in the constantly\nchanging environmental conditions.\nThrough this discussion we have emphasised the importance of the manage-processes, particularly that\nof the strategy and performance management process, in creating and sustaining competitive\nadvantage. However, Mintzberg et al [1999] conclude that strategies can emerge as a result of a variety\nof factors. They argue that a strategy can be planned or can emerge as a pattern, which can be seen\nretrospectively. They consider that it is important for the organisation to recognise emergent strategies,\nas the emergent strategy will have an impact on how the organisation manages its performance,\nbecause an emergent strategy will have played an important part in the formulation of current\nbehaviours and values held within the organisation. Research by Acur and Bititci [2001] demonstrated\nthat, in order to maximise the performance of their enterprise, managers are continuously making\nstrategic decisions in response to internal and external impulses.\n12\nIn our view, in the 21st century where the operating environment (i.e. internal and external) of an\norganisation is continuously changing, the calendar driven approach to strategy and performance\nmanagement is no longer appropriate. A dynamic process for managing strategy and performance is\nrequired which continuously monitors its internal and external operational environment, identifies\nevents of significance and triggers actions which may change: the direction of the business, the way a\nbusiness unit competes in its market or the priorities of an operate or support process. One key message\nemerging from the practices of good successful companies and from the literature is that the speed of\nthis process, i.e. its ability to rapidly make, deploy and implement decisions, is of paramount\nimportance [Childe 1998, Jagdev and Browne 1998].\nSo far the above discussion has focused on the need for a dynamic and agile strategy and performance\nmanagement process for a single enterprise. In a collaborative enterprise, there is a need for a similar\nprocess to manage the strategy and performance of the extended enterprise. It is therefore critical that\nthe manage processes of individual organisations are co-ordinated to ensure that the whole value\nsystem representing the collaborative enterprise creates and sustains competitive advantage.\n3.2. CUSTOMER VALUE\nOther trends [Porter M. 1985, Richardson 1985 and Treacy and Wiersema 1996] are also showing that\ncompanies are becoming more focused on their marketing and business strategies. Figure 2 illustrates\nthis trend where during the 80s companies were trying to be good at everything but failing in all counts.\nPorter [1985] recognised the pattern that companies with focus and differentiation were succeeding,\nconsequently in the 90s we have seen a shift towards focus and differentiation. Treacy and Wiersema\n13\n[1996] have taken the concept of focus and differentiation one step further and argued that the market\nleaders build their strategies on one of three value propositions:\n\uf0b7 Operational excellence: These companies provide middle of the market products at the best price\nwith the least inconvenience. Low price and hassle-free service.\n\uf0b7 Product leadership: These organisations offer products that push performance boundaries. The\nproposition to customers is an offer of the best product in the best time. Moreover, product leaders\ndon't build their propositions with just one innovation; they continue to innovate year after year,\nproduct after product.\n\uf0b7 Customer intimacy. These organisations focus on delivering not what the market wants but what\nspecific customers want. Customer-intimate companies do not pursue one-time transactions; they\ncultivate relationships. They specialise in satisfying unique needs. Their proposition to the customer\nis: we have the best solution for you and we provide all the support you need to achieve optimum\nresults.\nFigure 2. Trends in Marketing and Business Strategies\n80\u2019s\nQuality\nDelivery\nPrice\nFlexibility\nImage\n\u2026\n\u2026\n90\u2019s\nFocus\n&\nDifferen-\ntiation\n2000+\nValue\nProposition\n\/\nStrategic\nPosture\n14\nIn our research, which was instituted to investigate the value propositions proposed by Treacy and\nWiersema, we have taken these propositions one-step further [Martinez and Bititci, 2000 and 2001].\nWe have mapped several companies against the three value propositions and we found that some of the\ncompanies did not fit. One of these is Highland Spring, a famous Scottish natural mineral water\nproducer. On the one hand, Highland Spring could be classified as a product leader because it is a\nleader in the market, the brand is recognised worldwide and the margins are healthy. On the other hand,\nit is not a product leader because it does not introduce continuous innovations. These findings led us to\nextend Treacy and Wiersema\u2019s original value propositions in to a Value Matrix by adding Hard and\nSoft dimensions to value, thus creating six value propositions. The hard and soft dimension of this\nmatrix referees to tangible and intangible dimensions of value. For example, continuous innovation of\ntechnological products, customisation of existing products to meet a particular customers specific needs\nand cost minimisation are considered to be hard value offerings as they are tangible. Where as, brand\nimage, interpersonal relationships\/trust and easy-to-do business-with are considered to be soft value\nofferings as they are comparatively intangible.\nThis matrix was then extended into a Value Cube (Figure 3) by the addition of the third dimension,\nwhich summarises the underlying characteristics an organisation must have in order to succeed in one\nof these six value propositions. These are:\n\uf0b7 Innovators: Organisations who continuously innovate and invent the next generation of\ntechnologies. Their value proposition to their customers is: technologically and functionally most\nadvanced and innovative products - e.g. Intel.\n\uf0b7 Brand Manager: Organisations who develop a brand image based on style, quality image, etc.,\nmaking a lifestyle statement. Their value proposition is: products that make you feel better, get you\nrecognised, will help you to make a lifestyle statement - e.g. Nike and Highland Spring.\n15\n\uf0b7 Price Minimisers: Organisations who produce and\/or sell good but ordinary products and services\nat most competitive prices. Their value proposition is: value for money - e.g. Nissan, Price\/Costco,\nTesco.\n\uf0b7 Process Simplifiers: These are organisations who are extremely easy and simple to deal with. They\nremove complexity and hassle from their customers, making life simpler and more productive for\ntheir customers. Their value proposition is: if you deal with us your business\/life will be more\nproductive and hassle free - e.g. ScrewFix Direct, Houston Warehousing, DHL.\n\uf0b7 Technological Integrators: These organisations provide specialist technological solutions to their\ncustomers. Their value proposition is: we understand your business and we have the capability of\ntailoring our products to make your business more efficient and\/or effective - e.g. Alcan Specialist\nChemicals.\n\uf0b7 Socialisors: These organisations develop interpersonal relationships with some key\ncustomers. They know the customers' business, personalities and sensitivities and they\ncan provide personalised services in a style acceptable to the customer. Here, the value\nproposition is: Familiarity, trust, interpersonal relationships - e.g. most small management\nconsultancies and trades-men work on these bases.\nFigure 3. The six value propositions of the Value Cube [from Martinez and Bititci, 2001].\nTechnological\nIntegrators Socialisors\nPrice\nMinimisers\nProcess\nSimplifiers\nInnovators BrandManagers\nProduct\nLeadership\nOperational\nExcellence\nCustomer\nIntimacy\nHard Soft\n16\nThese value propositions serve to create focus within an organisation to create a value strategy within\nthe business.\nOur prediction is that in the 21st century there will only be a few companies who compete by being\nInnovators or Price Minimisers. The majority of the companies will have to pursue one of the other\nfour value strategies.\nIn fact, these value propositions are not mutually exclusive. In the future, companies will have to\ndemonstrate excellence in more than one area, to add value. For example, the primary strategic focus of\nan enterprise could be technological integration. But, in order to provide innovative products that are\ntailored to meet individual customers needs, they also have to demonstrate some of the key\ncompetencies associated with innovators as a secondary priority and they have to underpin these\nthrough certain characteristics of process simplifiers.\nThe question is, although the value propositions make sense in articulating the strategic direction of an\nenterprise, what role do they have in collaboration? and how do collaborative systems effect the value\nproposition of enterprises who are trying to work within a collaborative system?\n3.3. EXTENDED BUSINESS PROCESSES\nThe IFIP WG5.7 conference that was held in Troon, Scotland, in 1998, concluded that: \"In the\nmillennium, competition will not be between individual companies but will be between individual\nvalue systems\" [Bititci and Carrie, 1998].\n17\nFigure 4 illustrates a typical supply chain where a number of suppliers are involved, such as\nmultinationals, SMEs, transportation and distribution companies, warehouses and so on. Traditionally,\nthe focus has been on the supply chain in order to manage the movement of materials from suppliers to\nend-customer. However, towards the end of the 90s we have seen emphasis being placed on the\nmanagement of the demand system. Nokia presents an excellent case study [Eloranta, 1999] where they\nmanage and balance the supply and demand systems so that they have an efficient and effective value\nsystem. However, the value system is not just a matter of a balanced supply and demand system. There\nare a series of other providers and suppliers into this system. There is equipment suppliers, service\nsuppliers, consultancies, research and education institutions, banks and other financial institutions,\ngovernment agencies and so on. All of these organisations represent pieces of the jigsaw within the\ntotal system. Unless all the bits of the jigsaw actually work effectively, not to optimise their own\noperation but to optimise the whole system, then the whole system will fail to generate sufficient value.\nSupply System\nDemand\nSystem\nEquipment suppliers\nService suppliers\nEducation Institutions\nBank\nGovernment agencies\netc\nFigure. 4. The Value System [adapted from Eloranta 1999].\n18\nThe implication of this is that we need to extend all of our business processes (not just the order\nfulfilment process) beyond the boundaries of our organisation into our suppliers and customers\nbusinesses (Figure 5). Hammer [2001] reports that re-engineering and streamlining the business\nprocesses within the boundaries of the organisation is not sufficient to achieve super-efficiency. Super-\nefficient companies have their business processes extending beyond their organisational boundaries.\nOur own research suggest that in extending the processes into the customers and suppliers, the\nprocesses also need to be supported by other peripheral providers and suppliers to achieve super-\nefficiency, and e-business technologies and models have a significant contribution to make in\nfacilitating the extension of these business processes in to customer and supplier enterprises.\nFigure. 5. The extended business processes.\n4. THE WHAT? AND THE HOW?\nTaking these trends and analysing them in the context of the competitive business structure presented\nearlier in Figure 1b, we could conclude that:\nS\net\nD\nirection\nForm\nulate\nS\ntrategies\nD\nirect\nBusiness\nM\nan\nag\ne\nFi\nna\nnc\ne\nS\nup\npo\nrt\nPe\nrs\non\nne\nl\nM\nan\nag\ne\nT\nec\nhn\nol\nog\ny\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\ne\nLe\nar\nni\nng\nS\net\nD\nirection\nForm\nulate\nS\ntrategies\nD\nirect\nBusiness\nM\nan\nag\ne\nFi\nna\nnc\ne\nS\nup\npo\nrt\nPe\nrs\non\nne\nl\nM\nan\nag\ne\nT\nec\nhn\nol\nog\ny\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\ne\nLe\nar\nni\nng\nS\net\nD\nirection\nForm\nulate\nS\ntrategies\nD\nirect\nBusiness\nM\nan\nag\ne\nFi\nna\nnc\ne\nS\nup\npo\nrt\nPe\nrs\non\nne\nl\nM\nan\nag\ne\nT\nec\nhn\nol\nog\ny\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\ne\nLe\nar\nni\nng\nGet Order\nDevelop Product\nFulfil Order\nSupport Product\nSuppliers Customers\nS\net\nD\nirection\nForm\nulate\nS\ntrategies\nD\nirect\nBusiness\nM\nan\nag\ne\nFi\nna\nnc\ne\nS\nup\npo\nrt\nPe\nrs\non\nne\nl\nM\nan\nag\ne\nT\nec\nhn\nol\nog\ny\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\ne\nLe\nar\nni\nng\nS\net\nD\nirection\nForm\nulate\nS\ntrategies\nD\nirect\nBusiness\nM\nan\nag\ne\nFi\nna\nnc\ne\nS\nup\npo\nrt\nPe\nrs\non\nne\nl\nM\nan\nag\ne\nT\nec\nhn\nol\nog\ny\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\ne\nLe\nar\nni\nng\nS\net\nD\nirection\nForm\nulate\nS\ntrategies\nD\nirect\nBusiness\nM\nan\nag\ne\nFi\nna\nnc\ne\nS\nup\npo\nrt\nPe\nrs\non\nne\nl\nM\nan\nag\ne\nT\nec\nhn\nol\nog\ny\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\ne\nLe\nar\nni\nng\nS\net\nD\nirection\nForm\nulate\nS\ntrategies\nD\nirect\nBusiness\nS\net\nD\nirection\nForm\nulate\nS\ntrategies\nD\nirect\nBusiness\nM\nan\nag\ne\nFi\nna\nnc\ne\nS\nup\npo\nrt\nPe\nrs\non\nne\nl\nM\nan\nag\ne\nT\nec\nhn\nol\nog\ny\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\ne\nLe\nar\nni\nng\nM\nan\nag\ne\nFi\nna\nnc\ne\nS\nup\npo\nrt\nPe\nrs\non\nne\nl\nM\nan\nag\ne\nT\nec\nhn\nol\nog\ny\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\ne\nLe\nar\nni\nng\nS\net\nD\nirection\nForm\nulate\nS\ntrategies\nD\nirect\nBusiness\nM\nan\nag\ne\nFi\nna\nnc\ne\nS\nup\npo\nrt\nPe\nrs\non\nne\nl\nM\nan\nag\ne\nT\nec\nhn\nol\nog\ny\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\ne\nLe\nar\nni\nng\nS\net\nD\nirection\nForm\nulate\nS\ntrategies\nD\nirect\nBusiness\nS\net\nD\nirection\nForm\nulate\nS\ntrategies\nD\nirect\nBusiness\nM\nan\nag\ne\nFi\nna\nnc\ne\nS\nup\npo\nrt\nPe\nrs\non\nne\nl\nM\nan\nag\ne\nT\nec\nhn\nol\nog\ny\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\ne\nLe\nar\nni\nng\nM\nan\nag\ne\nFi\nna\nnc\ne\nS\nup\npo\nrt\nPe\nrs\non\nne\nl\nM\nan\nag\ne\nT\nec\nhn\nol\nog\ny\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\ne\nLe\nar\nni\nng\nS\net\nD\nirection\nForm\nulate\nS\ntrategies\nD\nirect\nBusiness\nM\nan\nag\ne\nFi\nna\nnc\ne\nS\nup\npo\nrt\nPe\nrs\non\nne\nl\nM\nan\nag\ne\nT\nec\nhn\nol\nog\ny\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\ne\nLe\nar\nni\nng\nS\net\nD\nirection\nForm\nulate\nS\ntrategies\nD\nirect\nBusiness\nS\net\nD\nirection\nForm\nulate\nS\ntrategies\nD\nirect\nBusiness\nM\nan\nag\ne\nFi\nna\nnc\ne\nS\nup\npo\nrt\nPe\nrs\non\nne\nl\nM\nan\nag\ne\nT\nec\nhn\nol\nog\ny\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\ne\nLe\nar\nni\nng\nM\nan\nag\ne\nFi\nna\nnc\ne\nS\nup\npo\nrt\nPe\nrs\non\nne\nl\nM\nan\nag\ne\nT\nec\nhn\nol\nog\ny\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\ne\nLe\nar\nni\nng\n19\n\uf0b7 Although, at a superficial level, collaboration between firms may appear to take place at enterprise\nlevel, in reality collaboration takes place at business unit level. In fact, in complex organisations,\nwhich may have several business units, each business unit may be part of a different collaborative\nsystem. Figure 6 illustrates this concept where enterprise E1 has three business units (BU1, BU2\nand BU3). Each business unit is part of a different extended enterprise and, therefore, a different\ncollaborative system - depicted by arrows with different patterns.\nFigure 6. Architecture of collaborative systems between enterprises.\n\uf0b7 Within the architecture presented in Figure 6, any one collaborative system (extended enterprise or\nextended business unit) has to ensure that the operate processes are extended across to enterprises\nwithin that collaborative system. Figure 7 illustrates the business process architecture of an\nextended enterprise where three business units of three different enterprises are joined to create an\nextended enterprise with extended operate processes and local support processes.\n\uf0b7 The literature on value proposition suggested that enterprises need to make their value propositions\nexplicit. Research by Martinez and Bititci [2001] identified that value propositions arise at business\nunit level as each business unit within and enterprise may have a different value proposition. It is\nE1\nBU1\nBU3\nBU2\nE2\nBU1\nBU3\nBU2\nE3\nBU1\nBU3\nBU2\nE4\nBU1\nBU3\nBU2\nE6\nBU1\nBU3\nBU2\nE5\nBU1\nBU3\nBU2\n20\nour proposal that the extended enterprise should have a value proposition, that defines the strategic\nposture for the entire extended enterprise. This value proposition can then be deployed down to\nvalue propositions for each individual business unit. Indeed, the value proposition\/strategic posture\nof each business unit may be different, but it is essential that they remain complementary (Fig. 7).\n\uf0b7 In order to ensure that the strategic posture and associated performance objectives remain\ncomplimentary across individual business units within different enterprises a meta level\nperformance management process is proposed to integrate and co-ordinate the individual\nperformance management process within each enterprise (Figure 7).\nFigure 7. The proposed architecture for an extended enterprise.\nThe next section outlines the research conducted, based on a single case study, to explore the validity\nof this structure. This research whilst confirming that this structure is valid, also illustrates that, in\nreality, this structure is significantly more complex than that illustrated in Figure 7.\nE1\nBU1\nBU3\nBU2\nE2\nBU1\nBU3\nBU2\nE3\nBU1\nBU3\nBU2\nThe Business = E1\nExtended Products Support Process\nBusiness Units\nExtended Develop Product Process\nExtended Order Fulfilment Process\nExtended Generate Demand Process\nThe Business = E3\nBusiness Units\nThe Business = E2\nBusiness Units\nSupport\nProcesses\nSupport\nProcesses\nSupport\nProcesses\nValue\nProp.\nValue\nProp.\nValue\nProp.\nPerformance\nManagement\nProcess\nPerformance\nManagement\nProcess\nPerformance\nManagement\nProcess\nValue\nProposition\n21\n5. CASE STUDY: Daks Simpson Limited\nThe case data presented in this section was collected through a series of semi-structured interviews and\nworkshops with the management team of the case study organisation.\nDaks Simpson is an apparel manufacturers specialising in ladies' and gents' suits, jackets and trousers.\nThe manufacturing facilities are based in Scotland with product design based in London. The products\nare sold in a global market. Daks is a globally recognised brand name with a significance presence in\nthe Far-East market, particularly in Japan.\nIn practice Daks has two business units, These are:\n\uf0b7 Brand Business which specialises in the design, manufacture and sales of products under the Daks\nbrand. These products are tailored garments produced to high specifications in limited quantities.\nTypically, a gent's suit may sell at \u00a3400 - \u00a3600 in one of Daks' stores or through one of their\nretailers, such as Fraser, Slater or Harrods in the UK and through Nordstrom in the US.\n\uf0b7 Contract Business which specialises in the design, manufacture and sales of products either under\ncustomers own labels, such as the St Michaels label for Marks and Spencer, or for corporate wear\nunder a customers name such as Bank of Scotland. Compared to the garments produced for the\nDaks brand these are much simpler products sold in larger volumes. These are mass-produced\nrather than tailored in contrast to the Daks product range.\nTable 2 below illustrates the nature of the extended enterprise for each one of the business units.

The collaborative structure of Daks Simpson Limited.\n23\nFurther analysis of the Daks' \"Order Fulfilment\" and \"Product Development\" processes illustrate that\nthe overall picture is quite complex, as shown in Figures 8 and 9. Here, for both Extended Business\nUnits, the two processes have been mapped in their extended forms to illustrate the value chain of each\nextended process, whilst the details of the processes internal to Daks have been suppressed. Figure 8\nshows that the two extended processes have enterprises\/organisations that are both specific and\ncommon to both processes. For example, cloth suppliers, such as Arthur Bell, Nobles, Moon, etc., have\na role to play in both the Product Development process and the Order fulfilment process. Whereas\ncatwalks are specifically part of the extended product development process, the equipment suppliers\nand subcontractors are specifically part of the extended order fulfilment process.\nFigure 9 on the other hand illustrates a much simpler picture for the Extended Contract Business Unit;\nthis is not a surprised as this is a much simpler business unit where product variety is low and volumes\nare high with relatively low product development activity. Although this is a much simpler extended\nbusiness unit, structurally it demonstrates the same characteristics as the Extended Daks Business Unit.\nHowever, further analysis (not illustrated in Figures 8 and 9) also revealed that the organisations\ncommon to both extended processes are split internally. For example, in the case of the extended Daks\nBusiness Unit, in one of the cloth suppliers (Nobles) there is a team of people who work closely with\nthe designers in Daks on product development whilst another team in Nobles is working closely with\nthe order fulfilment team in Daks. Furthermore, the product development and the order fulfilment\nteams in Nobles are in continuous communication with their counterparts in Daks but they rarely\ncommunicate with each other within Nobles. Our research established that this was a common\noccurrence in all those suppliers and customer who are involved in both order fulfilment and product\ndevelopment processes.\n24\nFigure 8.

Flow of information and knowledge along each extended business unit\n2. Flow of information and knowledge between two different extended units\n3. Flow of information and knowledge along each extended process\n4. Flow of information and knowledge between two different extended processes\n26\n6. DISCUSSIOIN\nWe started this paper by asking two questions; In order to create and sustain competitive advantage\nthrough collaborative systems WHAT should we be managing? and HOW should we be managing it?\nWe started with introducing the Competitive Business Structure (Figure 1b) and reviewing some of the\nglobal trends in manufacturing and business, which led us to focus on Manage Processes, Value\nPropositions and Extended Business Processes. We then went on to developing a model of the\ncollaborative architecture for extended enterprises and demonstrated the validity and complexity of this\narchitecture through a case study.\nFrom a methodological perspective this research is based on Kaplan's (1998) and Meredith's (1993)\ninnovative constructivism. Here the researcher starts with an observation of the limitations of the\ncurrent knowledge and practices and goes on to develop innovative ideas to address these limitations\neither through documentation of innovative practices (Kaplan 1998) or through logical deduction from\nthe existing literature. The researcher then collects cases, teaches and speaks about the innovation,\nwrites articles and books and then implements the new concept. The researcher goes through this loop\nin order to achieve initial, intermediate and advanced implementations, which continuously informs\ntheory (Meredith, 1993). This approach was used to develop the Balanced Score Card (Kaplan and\nNorton, 1992 - 1996 - 2000a -2000b)\nThe research presented in this paper can be seen as:\n\uf0b7 An initial deduction, from literature, of an architecture (Figures 6 and 7) for managing extended\nenterprises.\n\uf0b7 Initial testing and description of the validity of this model through a case study.\n27\n\uf0b7 An initial set of hypothesis with respect to systems requirements of\nThe validity of the model was tested through a single, but in depth, case study, focusing on two distinct\nbusiness units within the organisation. It is therefore realistic to state that, in this case, the architecture\npresented is valid. Therefore, it should be applicable in other cases. However, because the validation is\nbased on a single case study, we cannot claim that the results are universal. Thus we would propose the\nfollowing as hypothesis for further research.\n6.1 THE WHAT?\nIn our view, to create and sustain competitive advantage through collaborative systems, it is the\nfollowing structure that needs to be understood and managed -\n\uf0b7 An extended enterprise is an integration of business units of various enterprises - i.e. the extended\nbusiness unit. In this context one enterprise can be part of several extended enterprises (Figure 6)\n\uf0b7 Within each extended enterprise the operate processes extend beyond the boundaries of an\nenterprise along the extended enterprise\n\uf0b7 The structure of the business process architecture is complex - in an extended enterprise, different\noperate processes may extend into different enterprises, as illustrated in the case study (Figures 8\nand 9).\n6.2 THE HOW?\nIn managing the collaborative architecture of an extended enterprise the following critical factors\nshould be taken into consideration.\n\uf0b7 The strategic posture and objectives (or the value proposition) of the extended enterprise needs to\nbe identified and deployed to the individual business units along the extended enterprise. Indeed,\n28\nthe strategic posture and objectives of each business unit may be differ. The critical issue here is\nthat the these should be complementary to one another and to the overall strategic posture.\nOtherwise we will be sub-optimising the performance of the overall extended enterprise.\n\uf0b7 Each enterprise should have a process for managing its strategy and performance. This process\nshould continuously monitor the internal and external environment of the enterprise and make\ndecisions leading to actions which may effect; the priorities of a business process; the way a\nbusiness unit competes within its market; the value proposition of a business unit; or the number or\nthe scope of business units a business chooses to operate with.\n\uf0b7 In order to maintain compatibility between the business units of different enterprises operating\nalong an extended enterprise, it is essential for the strategy and performance management processes\nof each enterprise to co-ordinate with the others through a meta manage-process.\n\uf0b7 Collaborative systems are required which facilitate information and knowledge flow within each\nenterprise and within each extended enterprise capable of operating at various levels concurrently.\nAt extended enterprise level collaborative systems should ensure that the appropriate knowledge\nand information flows from the performance management process of one enterprise to another.\nMore specifically to create and sustain competitive advantage through collaborative systems,\ninformation systems are required which are capable of:\n\uf0b7 Facilitating the concurrent management of the extended enterprise as well as the individual\nenterprises within the value system.\n\uf0b7 Differentiating between different business units of an enterprise where each business unit\nmay be part of a different extended enterprises which.\n\uf0b7 Facilitating flow of information and knowledge across the meta-manage process for each\nextended enterprise. Including information and knowledge flows relating to:\n29\no The strategic posture of the extended enterprise and the strategic role of each\nmember enterprise.\no The performance objectives, targets and achievements of the external enterprise and\nthe individual enterprises.\n\uf0b7 Differentiating between different operate processes whilst ensuring that critical interactions\nbetween different extended operate processes are maintained.\n\uf0b7 Facilitating flow of information, knowledge and work between the meta-manage process\nand the individual extended operate processes.\n\uf0b7 Facilitating flow of information, knowledge and work along the extended operate processes\nas well across these processes to ensure that critical linkages are maintained.\n6.3 FURTHER RESEARCH\nSo far in this paper we have built a model (i.e. the architecture of an extended enterprise) based on\nprevious work and literature, and demonstrated, to a limited extent, that this theory is valid. The model\npresented in this paper raises a number of issues which require further analysis. These are:\n\uf0b7 An organisation may be part of more than one value system, that is, as it operates a number of\nbusiness units, one of its business units may be part of one value system and another business may\nbe part of another value system with each business unit having a different value proposition.\nResearch by Martinez and Bititci [2001] demonstrated that a business can have more than one value\nproposition and that sometimes having different value proposition within one enterprise can lead to\nconflicts and inefficiencies within that enterprise, depending on the interdependence of the value\npropositions. However, the exact natures of these conflicts are not well understood. It is therefore\nessential to develop better understanding of strategic coordination between enterprises operating as\npart of an extended enterprise.\n30\n\uf0b7 The model suggests that the collaborative architecture of the extended enterprise is WHAT needs to\nbe managed (i.e. the business, business units, the extended operate processes, the support processes\nand the activities within these processes). The implication of this is that, if we are to manage these\nextended processes we need to manage our people along these processes [Hammer, 1999].\nHowever, a majority of enterprises today are still functionally organised and people are still\nmanaged in functional silos. To date we do not fully understand the methods, tools and techniques\nrequired to facilitate management and operation of process-based teams within an organisation\n[Mendibil and MacBryde, 2002]. The management of process-based teams for extended processes\nis an area that requires significant amount of research.\n\uf0b7 Since the seminal paper by Hammer [1990] introducing the concept of business processes, there has\nbeen a lot of research and development in the field of business process management. However, it is\nthe manage processes that sustain competitive advantage by recognising and responding to changes\nin their internal and external environment either through maintaining and developing a winning\nformula or through identifying and changing to a winning formula. Whilst there has been\nsignificant research done to document the operate processes [Childe et al, 1995] and to develop\nperformance measures for these processes [Bititci and Carrie, 1998, Bititci, 2000, Bourne et al,\n2000 and Neely 1999], little or no work has been done to identify the manage processes or indeed\nto develop models of these processes. Thus, the manage processes required to support extended\nenterprises needs to be better understood.\n31\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper is about the competitive structure of collaborative\/extended enterprises and implication of\nthis on management systems. The paper is not about seeking competitive advantage through\ncollaborative systems. We realise that globalisation of commercial and industrial activities are a\nsymptom of collaboration between enterprises for economic advantage. In this paper we do not\nquestion this and take it as a given. The paper is about the structure of a collaborative\/extended\nenterprise (The What?) and how this structure needs to be managed (The How?) if the collaborative\nenterprise is to create and sustain competitive advantage.\nIn our view this paper makes a contribution in three areas:\n\uf0b7 It makes the complex structure of collaborative enterprises explicit from two points of view:\na. From the point of view of the extended enterprise\nb. From the point of view of the individual enterprise who has to manage its participation in\none or more collaborative\/extended enterprises\n\uf0b7 It proposes an initial management systems architecture that would facilitate efficient and effective\nmanagement of the collaborative enterprise from both of the viewpoints described above.\n\uf0b7 It outlines an initial set of requirements for management systems that would be needed to support\nthis architecture.\n\uf0b7 It also raises further research questions on the management of the collaborative enterprise.\n32\nREFERENCES\nAcur N and Bititci U S, PROPHESY - The Strategy Management Process: A Case Study, IFIP WG5.7\nConference on Strategic Manufacturing, Aalborg, Denmark, August 2001.\nBeer S.
