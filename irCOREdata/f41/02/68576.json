INTRODUCTION\nThe resonant response of a nonlinear system to periodic\nforcing at a subharmonic frequency is studied in several ar-\neas of physics. For a nonlinear oscillator this problem has\nbeen investigated in detail in mechanics @1#. A nonlinear\noscillator also constitutes a simple and useful model that\nenables the susceptibility to be calculated, and is therefore of\nmajor interest for nonlinear optics @2#. The susceptibility is\noften analyzed with account taken of damping of the oscil-\nlator, but with a neglect of fluctuations. However, the cou-\npling to a thermal bath that gives rise to the damping must\nalso result in the occurrence of fluctuations. Additionally,\nfluctuations may result from an external noise driving the\noscillator.\nThe role of fluctuations is particularly important for the\nresonant response of an underdamped oscillator. The eigen-\nfrequency of the vibrations of a nonlinear oscillator v(E)\ndepends on the oscillator energy E ~or, equivalently, on the\nvibration amplitude!. For a fluctuating oscillator the energy\nvaries in time, creating a distribution over E: in the case of\nthermal fluctuations arising from a bath at temperature T ,\nthis distribution is of the form Z21exp(2E\/T). As a result,\nthe eigenfrequency v(E) fluctuates as well, with two impor-\ntant consequences: ~i! a corresponding frequency distribution\nis formed, i.e., the oscillator frequency is smeared; and ~ii!\nthe mean frequency ^v(E)& differs from the frequency of\nsmall-amplitude vibrations v(0) ~where we measure the en-\nergy relative to its value at the equilibrium position of the\noscillator!. Therefore, on the one hand, fluctuations may be\nused to \u2018\u2018tune\u2019\u2019 the system to a resonance with the frequency\nof the external force or its overtones. On the other hand, with\nincreasing fluctuation intensity the resonance itself is\nsmeared out. The latter occurs when the frequency smearing\ndv due to the fluctuations exceeds the uncertainty in the\nvibration frequency due to finite damping. For small fluctua-\ntion intensity the frequency smearing is given by\ndv5uv8(0)u^E&, where v8(E)[dv(E)\/dE .\nThe effects of classical and quantum fluctuations on the\nlinear response of a nonlinear oscillator have been investi-\ngated in considerable detail ~cf. @3\u201313#; see also @14# for\nreviews!. The problem is immediately related to the infrared\nabsorption spectra of localized vibrations in solids @15#, and\nalso to problems of acoustics and of engineering structures.\nAn advantageous feature of using a fluctuating oscillator as a\nmodel is that, in case of an underdamped oscillator, it is\nasymptotically exactly solvable: although the nonlinearity of\nthe oscillator is by no means small, a theoretical analysis of\nthe resonant response can be fulfilled in closed form @7# ~see\nalso @10,13#!. The nonlinear response of the oscillator to a\nnearly resonant field has also been analyzed in considerable\ndetail, and the results discussed in the context of optical bi-\nstability and phase conjugation @16#, transmission of high-\nQ optical and microwave cavities @17#, cyclotron resonance\nof an electron in a Penning trap @18#, and underdamped vi-\nbrations of ions trapped in a potential well below the surface\nof liquid helium @19#.\nIn the present paper we investigate the effect of fluctua-\ntions in an underdamped oscillator on its resonant nonlinear\nresponse to driving at a subharmonic frequency. We concen-\ntrate on the case of driving at a frequency V close to 12\nv(E) for energies E that lie within the width of the distri-\nbution over E . In this case, the nonlinear resonant absorp-\ntion, in terms of nonlinear optics, corresponds to two-photon\nabsorption ~TPA!, whereas the occurrence of forced vibra-\ntions of the oscillator at frequency 2V corresponds to\n*Permanent address: Research Institute for Metrological Service,\n117965 Moscow, Russia.\n\u2020\nPermanent address: Institute of Semiconductors, Ukrainian Acad-\nemy of Sciences, Kiev, Ukraine.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E SEPTEMBER 1996VOLUME 54, NUMBER 3\n541063-651X\/96\/54~3!\/2366~12!\/$10.00 2366 \u00a9 1996 The American Physical Society\nsecond-harmonic generation ~SHG!. TPA and SHG have\nbeen recently recognized as particularly advantageous for in-\nvestigating systems with broken inversion symmetry, like in-\nterfaces between isotropic media ~liquid-vapor interface, etc!\n@20\u201322#. Often the immediate object of investigation is non-\nlinear vibrations at the interface ~as in references cited\nabove!, and in many cases such vibrations are underdamped.\nUnderstanding the spectroscopy of TPA and SHG, and the\neffects of fluctuations on the corresponding spectra, are ex-\ntremely important in this context.\nBased on the arguments given above one would expect\nthat, in the appropriate range of V , it would be possible to\nincrease the nonlinear response by increasing the fluctuation\nintensity and thus \u2018\u2018tuning\u2019\u2019 the oscillator to resonance, but\nthat, with further increase in the fluctuation intensity, the\nresponse would decrease because of the broadening of the\nresonance due to frequency smearing. Such a behavior of the\nresponse as a function of noise intensity has recently at-\ntracted much attention in the context of stochastic resonance\n@23#. Stochastic resonance is most often considered for\nbistable systems, but there is no reason a priori to suppose\nthat it need be restricted to such systems. Indeed, a noise-\ninduced increase in linear response has been demonstrated in\nanalog experiments for a resonantly driven monostable un-\nderdamped oscillator @24#.\nIf the eigenfrequency of an oscillator is a nonmonotonic\nfunction of its energy, an increase of noise intensity may\nresult in a narrowing of the peak of the resonant absorption\n@12# and the occurrence, for very small damping and within a\ncertain range of noise intensities, of an additional peak at the\nextremal frequency ve @25#. One would expect a similar\npeak to occur in the spectrum of nonlinear absorption.\nIn Sec. II we discuss the model and provide an analytical\ntheory of the resonant nonlinear response of an underdamped\nnonlinear oscillator. The theory is valid for weak noise; it is\nperturbative in the amplitude of the driving field, but it is\nnonperturbative in the oscillator nonlinearity. In Sec. III we\ndescribe the analog simulator. In Sec. IV we present experi-\nmental results and compare them with the theory. Section V\ncontains concluding remarks. In Appendix A we analyze the\nresonant nonlinear response for noise-induced frequency\nsmearing dv greatly exceeding the oscillator damping. The\nmethod of moments for the nonresonant linear response of a\nnonlinear oscillator in the case of weak noise intensities is\ndescribed in Appendix B.\nII. THEORY OF AN UNDERDAMPED OSCILLATOR\nDRIVEN AT A SUBHARMONIC FREQUENCY\nA.

This is the model that, in\nthe absence of fluctuations, has traditionally been considered\nin connection with a variety of problems in nonlinear optics\n@2#. We will limit ourselves to a phenomenological analysis\nin which fluctuations are induced by an externally applied\nnoise f (t). The noise will be assumed to be white and Gauss-\nian.\nThe equation of motion of the oscillator is of the form\nq\u00a812Gq\u02d91v0\n2q1bq21gq35FcosVt1 f ~ t !,\n^ f ~ t !&50, ^ f ~ t ! f ~ t8!&54GTd~ t2t8!. ~1!\nWe assume the oscillator to be monostable, which is the case\nprovided g.0, b2,4v0\n2g .

Although the frequency strag-\ngling dv remains relatively small, dv[uv(T)2v0u!v0,\nand so also are the amplitudes of noise-induced vibrations at\nthe overtones of the eigenfrequencies v(E), the straggling\ndv may substantially exceed the frequency uncertainty G\ndue to damping. Therefore, in the sense that the ratio dv\/G\nmay still be large, the nonlinearity and fluctuations cannot be\nassumed to be small. Consequently, the resonant nonlinear\nresponse is qualitatively different from that in the neglect of\nfluctuational smearing of the frequency. The case where the\nnoise intensity is not limited by ~3! is considered in Appen-\ndix A; in the range T*v0\n4\/g ,v0\n6\/b2, one may neglect fre-\nquency smearing due to dissipation, which in many respects\nsimplifies the problem.\nB. Quasilinear response\nFor small amplitudes of the driving force and for moder-\nately weak noise intensities ~3!, the analysis of the resonant\nnonlinear response of the oscillator may be done in two steps\nfamiliar from @1#: ~i! one first ignores the oscillator nonlin-\nearity, so that a sinusoidal external force results in nonreso-\nnant vibrations at the force frequency V ~the perturbation\nparameter is the force amplitude F , weighted with nonlinear-\nity constants!; and ~ii! in the next iteration one substitutes the\ncorresponding oscillating term in the oscillator coordinate\ninto the nonlinear terms in the restoring force of the oscilla-\ntor. These terms then oscillate at the overtones of V , and act\nas an effective force that drives the oscillator. The resonant\nlinear response to this force may then be analyzed. In this\nway, for an oscillator with a non-weak nonlinearity, a com-\nplicated problem of resonant nonlinear response may be re-\nduced to the already solved problem of resonant linear re-\nsponse.\nFor moderately small noise intensities ~3! and to lowest\norder in the force amplitude F , nonresonant forced vibra-\ntions may be described in the harmonic approximation,\nq ~1 !~ t !'\nF\nv0\n22V2\ncos~Vt1f~1 !!,\nf~1 !'22GV\/~v0\n22V2!. ~4!\nThe phase shift f (1) allows for a weak linear absorption by\nthe oscillator.

We note that the proportionality factor be-\ntween k (2) and x9(2V) is the squared coefficient of the\ncubic nonlinearity b , in agreement with the well-known fact\nthat TPA occurs in noncentrosymmetric systems.\nC. Resonant susceptibility\nEquations ~7! and ~8! relate the intensity of the second\nharmonic signal ~SHS! and the coefficient of nonlinear ab-\nsorption k (2) to the resonant linear susceptibility of the os-\ncillator x(2V) at frequency 2V . Theoretical and experimen-\ntal results on the evolution with noise intensity of the\nimaginary part of the susceptibility x9(v) have clearly dem-\nonstrated @7,10\u201312,24# that, in an underdamped system, even\ncomparatively small changes in the noise intensity can\nstrongly affect linear resonant absorption.\nComplete analysis of the susceptibility is facilitated by the\nfact that, in the absence of the periodic force, the system\ninvestigated is effectively in thermal equilibrium at tempera-\nture T which is characterized by the noise intensity. For ther-\nmal equilibrium systems the real and imaginary parts of the\nsusceptibility x(v) are related to each other via Kramers-\nKronig relations, and both can be expressed in terms of the\nspectral density of fluctuations of the oscillator Q (0)(v) @26#:\nx9~v!5\npv\nT Q\n~0 !~v!,\nx8~v!5\n2\nT PE0\n`\ndv1Q ~0 !~v1!\nv1\n2\nv1\n22v2\n, ~9!\nQ ~0 !~v!5 12pE2`\n`\ndt eivt^q~ t !q~0 !& ,\nwhere P implies the Cauchy principal value and T is the\ntemperature.\nThe quantity Q (0)(v) for an underdamped nonlinear os-\ncillator has been investigated analytically in considerable de-\ntail for the range of moderately small noise intensities ~3!\n@7#, and numerically and experimentally in the general case\n@12#.\nIn Figs. 2 and 3 we show theoretical curves for the\nsquared absolute value of the susceptibility ux(v)u2 as a\nfunction of the noise intensity T for five values of v52V ,\nand as a function of v for three values of T , respectively. In\nFig. 4 we show the dependence on T of the real and imagi-\nnary parts of x(v). All curves have been obtained using the\nalgorithm of @12# and relations ~9!, and the parameters were\ntaken to be the same as in the experimentally investigated\nsystem ~see Sec. III!.\nIt is clear from Figs. 2 and 4 that, both for v'v0 and\nv've , the functions x8(v), x9(v), and ux(v)u2 display\nnonmonotonic dependences on T . The peaks in x9(v) and\nux(v)u2 vs T are most pronounced for v'v0.

Nonresonant susceptibilities\nAlthough the nonlinear absorption that we investigate is\nresonant, it is comparatively small for small amplitudes of\nthe driving force F . Therefore, in the analysis of the effect of\nnoise on the total ~linear 1 nonlinear! absorption of the os-\ncillator, it is necessary to take into account not only noise-\ninduced changes in nonlinear absorption, but also noise-\ninduced corrections to linear nonresonant absorption. These\ncorrections are obtained in Appendix B by solving the\nFokker-Plank equation.

ANALOG ELECTRONIC MODEL\nAND NUMERICAL ALGORITHMS\nThe effects of noise on resonant SHG and TPA have been\ninvestigated in analog electronic experiments. The analog\nmodel of ~1! was of a standard design, constructed on the\nbasis of the principles described in detail elsewhere @27#,\nusing operational amplifiers, multipliers, and other standard\nanalog components to perform the required mathematical op-\nerations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, in-\ntegration, etc. A block diagram of the circuit is shown in Fig.\n5. Here F in(t8)5F8cosV8t8 and f 8(t8), are respectively, a\nsignal and an external noise applied to an underdamped non-\nlinear oscillator. F8 is the amplitude of the signal in volts,\nf 8(t8) is the value of the noise voltage applied to the circuit,\nand V8 and t8 are the real frequency and time.\nThe differential equation for the voltage x in the circuit is\nof the form\nR3C1R5C2\nd2x\ndt82 1\nR3\nR4\nR5C2\ndx\ndt8 1x1R~1\/R611\/R7!x\n2\n1x31\nR3\nR2\nF8cosV8t81\nR3\nR1\nf 8~ t8!\n50, ~11!\nwhere we have chosen\nR5R6510 kV , R15R25100 kV ,\nR3511 kV , R5522 kV , R451.1MV ,\nR7515 kV , C15C2520 nF.\nFIG. 4.

However, for such\nsmall damping, the actual value usually differs from the\nnominal one due to the effects of stray capacitances and re-\nsistances in the circuit. In the present case, the actual value,\nmeasured experimentally by two independent methods @28#\nwas found to be G50.0061. For the chosen circuit param-\neters the variation of the oscillator\u2019s eigenfrequency with en-\nergy had a minimum at Em50.1635, as shown in Fig. 1 ~the\nlowest curve!.\nThe circuit model was driven by noise from a feedback\nshift-register noise generator and by a sinusoidal periodic\nforce from a Hewlett-Packard Model 3325B frequency syn-\nthesizer. The response of the circuit to the stochastic and\nperiodic forces was analysed with the aid of a Nicolet 1080\ndigital data processor.\nThe intensity of the second harmonic of the signal was\nmeasured directly from the ensemble-averaged signal in the\ncircuit ^x(t)& at frequency 2V . It follows from ~7! that this\nintensity divided by b2F4\/16(v022V2)4 gives us the value\nof the susceptibility ux(2V)u2, provided F is small\n(F50.0176 in our experiment!.\nThe two-photon absorption coefficient was determined\nfrom measurements of the phase shift f ~relative to the driv-\ning force! of the ensemble-averaged signal ^x(t)& at fre-\nquency V . In the range of moderately weak noise intensities\n~3! the expression for the phase shift can be obtained in a\nway similar to that used to derive Eq. ~8! for the absorption\ncoefficient. In the limit of weak absorption the phase shift is\ngiven by a sum of the contributions f (1) and f (2) that cor-\nrespond, respectively, to linear absorption and to TPA:\nf'f~1 !1f~2 !, f~2 !52\n1\n2\nb2F2\n~v0\n22V2!3\nx9~2V!,\n~13!\nwhere the phase shift f (1) is given by Eq. ~4! with the cor-\nrection determined by Eq. ~10!.\nThe digital simulation was based on the algorithm de-\nscribed in @29#. In all cases we used an integration time step\nof order 1024. For measurement of the spectral densities of\nfluctuations, we averaged typically over 20 000 periods of\nthe periodic forcing, or for an equivalent total time in the\nabsence of the periodic force.\nFor measurement of the phase lag as a function of noise\nintensity in the presence of the periodic forcing, a much\nlonger total integration time was used: note that the integra-\ntion time step itself places a lower limit on the precision of\nthe phase measurements ~see above! of '231024 rad. The\nnumber of averages included for each value of noise inten-\nsity was typically 840 000 periods of the periodic force. The\nquoted error on the phase lag from the digital simulations\nwas estimated by means of a x2 likelihood approach: the\n840 000 averages were divided into 42 statistically indepen-\ndent samples ~of 20 000 averages each!; the \u2018\u2018average\u2019\u2019\nphase lag was determined for each sample, and, from these\n42 independent measurements of the phase lag, the bona fide\nphase lag corresponding to the given noise intensity and its\nerror ~taken as one standard deviation in the x2) was com-\nputed.\nFor the case when periodic forcing was absent, given that\nthe damping G was typically very small so that the energy\nE ~see introduction! was changing slowly, it was also pos-\nsible to integrate the equations of motion using a quasisym-\nplectic scheme: some symplectic schemes are discussed in\n@30#. For the present case, the scheme used reads\nq*5qt1\nh\n2 pt ,\npt1h5\n1\n11Gh @~12Gh !pt1hF~q*!1\nA4GThw# ,\n~14!\nqt1h5q*1\nh\n2 pt1h .\nwhere qa[q(t5a), pa[q\u02d9 (t5a), etc., h is the integration\ntime step, F(q) is the deterministic force, and w is a random\nGaussian variable with zero average and a standard deviation\nof unity.\nThe spectral densities obtained using the algorithm of Eq.\n~14! coincided with those obtained using the algorithm of\n@29#.\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Second harmonic generation\nMeasurements of the intensity of the signal at the second\nharmonic of the forcing frequency are shown for two fre-\nquencies by the data points in Figs. 6~a! and 6~b!. In the\nrange of force amplitudes F investigated, the intensity of the\nsecond-harmonic signal ~SHS! was proportional to F4, and\nthe data in Fig. 6 have been appropriately scaled for com-\nparison with the relevant theoretical susceptibility curves\nfrom Fig 2. Also included in Fig. 6 are theoretical values of\nuxu2 from ~9! derived from power spectra obtained via digital\nsimulations of the dynamics. It is evident that all the results\nagree well within experimental error. ~Direct measurements\nof the linear response to a weak force at the resonant fre-\nquency V.v0 were also found to be in good agreement\nwith theory.! It is clear that the dependence of the SHS in-\ntensity on the noise intensity is strongly nonmonotonic, the\npeak of the SHS intensity being particularly tall and narrow\nfor V' 12v0. The noise-induced enhancement, defined as the\nratio of the maximal intensity of the signal at a given fre-\n54 2371RESONANT SUBHARMONIC ABSORPTION AND SECOND- . . .\nquency to the intensity for T50, was found to exceed a\nfactor of 4.5 under the experimental conditions.\nTo understand the temperature dependence of the SHS, it\nis illuminating to consider how resonance curves in the fre-\nquency domain evolve with temperature: see Fig. 3. As ex-\nplained above, the increase of the SHS is due to the fact that,\nby increasing T , the system can be tuned to resonance with\nthe frequency 2V . The left-hand peaks in Fig. 2 occur for\nvalues of the noise intensity given, in order of magnitude, by\nT;(2V2v0)\/v8(0). With further increase in T , ~i! the\nmaximum in the frequency response shifts away from 2V;\nand ~ii! the half-width of the resonant peak in the suscepti-\nbility as a function of frequency increases ~from the value\nG which is determined by dissipative spectral broadening for\nlow T where G@dv , to dv for higher T where dv@G).\nTherefore the SHS intensity decreases, and the overall de-\npendence of the signal on the noise intensity displays a sharp\npeak.\nAn interesting feature of the SHS intensity is that, for the\ncase where v(E) has a minimum, it may also display an\nadditional peak as a function of T . This occurs when the\nfrequency of the force V've\/2, where ve[v(Ee) is the\nextremal value of the frequency v(E),\nv8~Ee!50, v8~E ![dv~E !\/dE .\nThe nonmonotonicity of v(E) gives rise to a singularity in\nthe density of vibrational states @dv(E)\/dE#21. In turn, this\nsingularity gives rise to noise-induced narrowing of the peak\nof x9(v) with increasing noise intensity @12#, and the occur-\nrence of a characteristic zero-dispersion peak in x9(v) at\nve @25# for extremely low damping.\nOne would expect that the singularity at ve might affect\nthe resonant nonlinear response for V' 12 ve , and for noise\nintensities T of the order of Ee . It is this effect that is seen in\nFigs. 2 and 6.\nThe sharp noise-induced increase and subsequent de-\ncrease of the response with increasing noise intensity seen in\nFig. 2 may be viewed as a manifestation of stochastic reso-\nnance. Two distinctive features should be emphasized in this\ncontext: ~i! the system we have investigated is monostable,\nand the increase of the response is not related to a noise-\ninduced increase of the rate of switching between coexisting\nstable states of a bistable system as is often investigated in\nstochastic resonance @23#; and ~ii! in contrast to @24# we ob-\nserve the effect of the noise-induced increase of a nonlinear\nresponse, whereas the nonresonant linear response changes\nonly slightly with varying noise intensity. One may say that,\nwithin a certain range of noise intensities, noise may make a\nsystem \u2018\u2018more nonlinear,\u2019\u2019 but eventually with further in-\ncrease of T the nonlinearity is suppressed @31#.\nB. Nonlinear absorption\nAs explained above in Sec. III, a convenient way to in-\nvestigate the absorption of a periodic driving force FcosVt in\nan analog experiment is to determine the phase shift between\nthe ensemble-averaged signal ^x(t)& at frequency V and the\nforce itself. It follows from the theory @see Eqs. ~8! and ~13!#\nthat the absorption coefficient and the phase shift are each\nmade up of a sum of two components, representing linear\nand nonlinear contributions. In Figs. 7~a! and 8~a! we com-\npare the measured and calculated dependences of the total\nphase shift f on the noise intensity. It is clear that ufu dis-\nplays a peak as a function of T , that for V' 12v0 this peak is\ncomparatively narrow and sharp, and that for V' 12ve the\npeak, although well-resolved, is much broader. The theoreti-\ncal curves ~solid lines! in Figs. 7~a! and 8~a! were calculated\nusing Eq. ~13! with f (1) given by ~4! with the T-dependent\ncorrection 2Im@ln x(V)] from ~10!, and f (2) given by ~13!\nwith x(2V) from ~9!. To evaluate the spectral density of\nfluctuations in ~9!, we used the numerical algorithm of @12#.\nWe also carried out an additional numerical experiment in\nwhich the phase lag at the frequency of the weak periodic\nforce was found directly, as described in Sec. III, and the\nspectral density of fluctuations Q (0)(v) ~in the absence of\nthe driving force! was obtained by Monte Carlo simulation\nof the dynamics. The resultant values of Q (0)(v) were used\nto evaluate the phase shift according to Eqs. ~9! and ~13!,\nwith f (1) given by 2 arctanx9(V)\/x8(V). In Figs. 7 and 8\nthese results are compared with those derived from theory\nFIG. 6.

The pluses also repre-\nsent calculated susceptibilities, but using in ~9! spectral densities\nderived from digital simulations of the dynamics. The frequencies\nused were ~a! V\/v05 0.483 and ~b! 0.415.\n2372 54M. I. DYKMAN et al.\nand from analog experiment. All the results \u2013 including\nthose from theory, direct analog simulations, and numerical\nsimulations, both direct and in the absence of force \u2014 are in\ngood agreement with each other.\nAs discussed at the end of Sec. II, the contribution of the\nlinear nonresonant phase shift to the total phase shift is very\nimportant when the nonlinear resonant effect is relatively\nsmall. It is especially true for the broad and relatively weak\npeak at V' 12ve . For this reason we have measured the\nphase shift for very small force amplitudes when f'f (1)\n~see below!. The temperature dependences of the measured\nphase shift f and the calculated linear phase shift f (1) are\nshown, for two different frequencies, in Figs. 7~b! and 8~b!.\nIt can be seen that f (1), as given by ~4! with the\nT-dependent correction 2Im@ lnx(V)# from ~10!, is in rea-\nsonable agreement with both the measured f'f (1) and with\nthe values of f (1)52arctanx9(V)\/x8(V) obtained by com-\nputer simulation of Q (0)(v). ~The direct computer simula-\ntions were omitted in this case as being too time consuming.!\nNote that the relatively large scatter of the data arose because\nthe values of f (1) far from resonance were extremely small,\nso that the measurements were necessarily being performed\nclose to the instrumental resolution: the most important point\nto note is that the results were clearly very different from\nthose of Figs. 7~a! and 8~a!.\nThe dependence on noise intensity of the linear phase\nshift at a nonresonant frequency is monotonic. However, this\ndependence is unexpectedly strong for the value of the cubic\nnonlinearity parameter b5 53 used in the experiments. The\nnumerical values of the reduced noise intensity gT\/v0\n4 for\nwhich deviations from ~10! become substantial are as small\nas 231022. Formally, this is a consequence of large numeri-\ncal factors in the expression for the correction }b2 in Eq.\n~10!. Intuitively, it can be understood from the shape of the\npotential of the oscillator: for the value b5 53 this potential\nhas already become strongly anharmonic for energies that are\nmuch smaller than the characteristic energy value v0\n6\/b2\nFIG. 7. ~a!

It is\nseen that f increases nearly linearly with the squared ampli-\ntude of the force, F2, as indicated by the theoretical curve.\nThese results provide a clear demonstration that the phenom-\nena we are observing correspond to two-photon absorption\n@cf. Eq. ~13!#. Note, in particular, that the value of the force\namplitude used in all experiments ~except the linear phase\nshift measurements! was chosen as the largest amplitude for\nwhich the theory was expected to be applicable, and that, for\nsmall amplitudes F , f approaches the value of the phase\nshift for linear response f (1). This latter feature made it pos-\nsible to separate the linear and nonlinear contributions to the\nphase shift, simply by changing the amplitude of the driving\nforce in the experiment.\nFinally we note that the theory can immediately be gen-\neralized in two ways. First of all, strictly speaking, Eqs. ~7!\nand ~8! which we used to obtain the theoretical results and\nthe computer simulation data shown in Figs. 2\u20138, do not\napply away from range ~3!; and the full theory discussed in\nAppendix A should then be used. However, in the most in-\nteresting range of T where the dependence of the SHS on\nnoise intensity is nonmonotonic, the amplitudes of vibration\nof the oscillator at the overtones of the eigenfrequencies\nv(E) are small for energies E&T , and the simple theory of\nSec. II provides a good approximation. Second, the numeri-\ncal algorithm @12# used to evaluate the spectral density of\nfluctuations, and thus the linear susceptibility ~9!, is limited\nto resonant frequencies where Q (0)(v) has a peak. General\nanalysis of the linear susceptibility requires a complete solu-\ntion of the appropriately modified Fokker-Planck equation.\nWe have developed the necessary algorithm, and details will\nbe given in a later paper.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, we have developed a theory of an under-\ndamped nonlinear oscillator driven by a field at a subhar-\nmonic frequency V , and carried out a detailed experimental\ninvestigation of the oscillator dynamics. The theory applies\nfor an arbitrary nonlinearity of the oscillator. For moderately\nstrong noise, the resonant nonlinear response of the oscilla-\ntor has been described in terms of a linear susceptibility. The\nresults describe the spectra of nonlinear absorption ~the clas-\nsical analog of two-photon absorption! and the signal at the\nsecond harmonic as functions of the fluctuation intensity. We\nhave been able to predict, and measure, a strong noise-\ninduced amplification of resonant SHG and of TPA.\nWe have shown that both the signal at the second har-\nmonic, and the nonlinear absorption, display peaks as a func-\ntion of the noise intensity T . The peaks are sharp if 2V lies\nclose to the frequency v0 of small-amplitude vibrations of\nthe oscillator. We have shown that peaks can also occur if\n2V is close to the extremal value ve of the oscillator\u2019s\neigenfrequency v(E). The theory is in good qualitative and\nquantitative agreement with experiment. The results also\nagree well with those obtained from computer simulations of\na nonlinear oscillator in the absence of periodic driving. The\neffects considered may be of importance in connection with\na number of applications, from nonlinear optics and two-\nphoton spectroscopy to nonlinear response of underdamped\nsuperconducting quantum interference devices.\nOur results demonstrate that a simple theoretical model\ncan provide physical insight into the interrelation between\nthe linear and nonlinear responses of the oscillator and reveal\nthe connection between two-photon absorption in under-\ndamped systems and stochastic resonance.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work was supported by the Center for Fundamental\nMaterial Research at MSU, the Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council ~UK!, the European Community,\nthe Royal Society of London, the Gosstandart of Russia and\nthe International Science Foundation under Grant Nos.\nN62000 and N62300.

The\nabsorption is due to resonant processes in which the oscilla-\ntor is excited by the field; in the present case these are two-\nphoton processes. The corresponding resonant denominators\nare of the form of 2V2v(E). They enter expression ~A7!\nfor Wn\n(2)(I ,2V), and thus they enter the terms in\nWn\n(3)(I ,6V) that are proportional to Wn(2)(I ,6V) or to the\nderivative ]Wn\n(2)(I ,6V)\/]I . It is straightforward to imple-\nment on the computer the corresponding algorithm for evalu-\nation of the coefficient of two-photon absorption.\nAPPENDIX B: NOISE-INDUCED CORRECTIONS TO THE\nLINEAR NONRESONANT SUSCEPTIBILITY\nSuppose we have a Brownian particle, with the equation\nof motion\nq\u00a812Gq\u02d91v0\n2q1bq21gq35 f ~ t !,\n^ f ~ t ! f ~ t8!&54GTd~ t2t8!, ~B1!\nand that the damping and temperature are both small,\nG!v0 ,uguT\/v0\n4!1, and b2T\/v0\n6!1.
