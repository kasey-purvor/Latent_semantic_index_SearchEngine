Emotion \nwork was conceptualized and operationalized in terms of five dimensions: surface acting, \ndeep acting, frequency of emotional display, intensity of displayed emotion, and variety of \ndisplayed emotions. The results suggested a weak mediating role of emotional exhaustion \nin the relationship between emotion work and work attitudes. The results also revealed the \npresence of a substantial number of interaction effects in the relationship of emotion work \nwith emotional exhaustion and work attitudes. In particular, emotion work was related to \nemotional exhaustion solely by means of interactions, and the largest part of the \nrelationship of emotion work with work attitudes was also due to interaction effects. In the \ncases that main effects were present these were mainly caused by an allegedly secondary \ndimension of emotion work, the variety of displayed emotions, and not by any of the \nprimary dimensions. The national cultural characteristics provided an account for the \nidentified relationship pattern between emotion work, emotional exhaustion and work \nattitudes. In general, the study revealed the importance of the interactions between the \ndimensions of emotion work, and was also suggestive of the role of the national cultural \ncontext in the way emotion work is associated with outcomes that are of interest to \nemployees and organizations.  \n \nKeywords:  Emotional labour; interaction; emotional exhaustion; national culture; work \nattitudes; Greece. \nEmotion Work in the Hellenic Frontline Services Environment:  \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 3\nHow it Relates to Emotional Exhaustion and Work Attitudes  \nModern economies have been moving away from the production of manufacturing \nproducts and tend to rely heavily on the provision of services for income generation (e.g., \nThe Economist, 2006; OECD, 2003). However, provision of service products normally \nrequires direct (i.e., face-to-face or voice-to-voice) interaction with customers to a much \ngreater degree than the manufacturing of goods does. In the provision of service the quality \nof interaction with the customer, and the satisfaction the customer derives from this \ninteraction, is part of the supplied product. Therefore, the emotions displayed by service \nproviders when they interact with customers are a critical factor for the quality of service \noffered. For this reason, the display and management of appropriate emotions comprises a \nsubstantial part of the large number of service industry jobs that require direct interaction \nwith clients. Indeed, Tschan, Rochat and Zapf (2005) conducted research with individuals \nwho were performing predominantly service jobs and they found that the vast majority \n(i.e., nine out of ten) of their work-related interactions involved the display of prescribed \nemotions.  \nThe management of displayed emotions according to the requirements of the job is \nreferred to as emotion work (or \u201cemotional labour\u201d, Hochschild, 19831). More specifically, \nemotion work signifies the regulation of a job incumbent\u2019s emotional display so the \nconveyed emotions are in line with those expected by customers and by the organization \nfor meeting set service quality demands (e.g., Hochschild, 1983; Morris & Feldman, 1996; \nRafaeli & Sutton, 1987; and also see Sutton, 1991). For example, a bill collector should \nconvey urgency, an amusement park employee must express friendliness and joy, a flight \nattendant must display politeness, friendliness and confidence, and a bank teller should \nbehave politely and display knowledge and confidence. These emotions should be \nexpressed with consistency over time and across situations and clients, and independently \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 4\nof the job incumbent\u2019s actually felt emotions, mood or attitudes towards particular \ncustomers2.  \nTherefore, emotion work often necessitates the disguise or modification of the job \nholder\u2019s actual emotions in order to display the emotions required by one\u2019s job role \n(Ashforth & Humphrey, 1993; Hochschild, 1983). The process of disguising one\u2019s actual \nfeelings, which results in dissonance between true and displayed emotion (Hochschild, \n1983; Morris & Feldman, 1996; and see Tschan et al., 2005), is referred to as \u201csurface \nacting\u201d; while the process of modifying one\u2019s felt emotions in a way that actual and \ndisplayed emotions are in consonance with each other and with the expected emotion is \nreferred to as \u201cdeep acting\u201d (Hochschild, 1983).  \nThe literature stresses the difference between surface and deep acting. Surface acting \ninvolves the suppression of felt emotions combined with the adoption of an emotional \nmask; which is a process that imposes substantial strain, and is potentially psychologically \nand physically draining. On the other hand, although deep acting also requires effort from \nthe part of the individual it normally results in greater alignment between actual and \ndisplayed emotions; hence, in a reduction in the respective dissonance. These differences \nbetween deep and surface acting are critical as regards the ways in which they relate, or \nthey are expected to relate, to outcomes of emotion work (e.g., Ashforth & Tomiuk, 2000; \nBrotheridge & Lee, 2003; Grandey, 2003; Hochschild, 1983; Morris & Feldman, 1996; \nRafaeli & Sutton, 1987; Zapf, 2002).  \nAdditional dimensions of emotion work have been identified. These dimensions \npertain to characteristics and demands of emotion work that are not encompassed by the \ndisguise or modification of one\u2019s actual feelings, and include the frequency of emotional \ndisplay, the intensity of displayed emotion, and the variety of displayed emotions \n(Brotheridge & Lee, 2003; Morris & Feldman, 1996). Surface and deep acting have been \nconsidered as primary dimensions of emotion work, whilst frequency, intensity and variety \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 5\nhave been considered as secondary dimensions, described as \u201cemotion-related role \nrequirements\u201d (Brotheridge & Lee, 2003, p. 366). Indeed, the identification of frequency, \nintensity and variety as dimensions of emotion work has been inconsistent and more recent \nthan the identification of surface and deep acting (see, for example, Brotheridge & \nGrandey, 2002; Brotheridge & Lee, 2003; Grandey, 2003; Hochschild, 1983; but also see \nMorris & Feldman, 1996). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that these three secondary \ndimensions bear weaker and less consistent relationships with correlates and outcomes of \nemotion work. \nEmotion work and emotional exhaustion: Main effects \nIt has been legitimately suggested that engagement in emotion work negatively \nimpacts experiences of well-being (Brotheridge & Grandey, 2002; Hochschild, 1983). \nHowever, although emotion work is a highly contemporary issue, it is still a relatively new \nconstruct. Hence, empirical work on its correlates is still limited. Nevertheless, such work \nis available. \nThe index of well-being that has attracted most attention in emotion work research is \nemotional exhaustion. Emotional exhaustion signifies the experience of being strained and \ndepleted of one\u2019s emotional, primarily, and physical, secondarily, resources (e.g., Maslach, \n1982; Maslach, Schaufeli & Leiter, 2001). It is the most prominent facet of job burnout, \nthe psychological syndrome that is connected with chronic exposure to stressful \ninterpersonal encounters in the context of work (e.g., Maslach et al., 2001; Shirom, 1989). \nThe limited empirical research on emotion work has focused mostly on the relationship of \nemotional exhaustion with the primary dimensions of emotion work, surface and deep \nacting. This research is supportive of the conceptual distinction between surface and deep \nacting, and in line with the argument that surface acting is detrimental to employees\u2019 well-\nbeing (Brotheridge & Grandey, 2002; Hochschild, 1983). Indeed, the available empirical \nreports indicate a positive relationship between the degree to which employees engage in \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 6\nsurface acting and their levels of emotional exhaustion (Brotheridge & Lee, 2003; \nBrotheridge & Grandey, 2002; Grandey, 2003; Totterdell & Holman, 2003). On the other \nhand, that same research has failed to identify a relationship between deep acting and \nemotional exhaustion. Such a relationship has not been particularly expected in the \nrespective literature because, as noted, despite requiring effort too, deep acting leads to \ninternalization of one\u2019s job role and, hence, reduces dissonance between felt and displayed \nemotions (e.g., Brotheridge & Grandey, 2002, p. 22; Grandey 2003, p. 89; and see \nBrotheridge & Lee, 2003, p. 372; Sheldon, Ryan, Rawsthorne & Ilardi, 1997; Totterdell & \nHolman, 2003).  \nTherefore, it is reasonable to expect a relationship between surface acting and \nemotional exhaustion, but not between deep acting and emotional exhaustion. \nHypothesis 1. Surface acting will be positively related to emotional exhaustion. \nDue to their recent identification, empirical research with the secondary dimensions of \nemotion work is extremely limited. In the only systematic investigation that involved these \ndimensions, Brotheridge and her associates (Brotheridge & Grandey, 2002; Brotheridge & \nLee, 2003) found no relationship between them and emotional exhaustion3. However, \nconsidering the scarcity of empirical work additional research is needed. Hence, one of the \naims of the present study was to contribute with additional empirical evidence on the \nrelationship between the secondary dimensions of emotion work and emotional exhaustion. \nTaking into account the extant limited empirical research, which reports absence of \nrelationships, no hypotheses were posed. However, the identification of relationships could \nnot be ruled out, considering that theoretical work has expressed expectations for \nassociations between these secondary dimensions of emotion work and emotional \nexhaustion (Morris & Feldman, 1996). \nEmotion work and emotional exhaustion: Interaction effects \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 7\nAs seen above, only one dimension of emotion work has been found, and is \nhypothesized herein, to relate to emotional exhaustion. However, the empirical, but also \nthe conceptual, literature has concentrated solely on the main effects of the components of \nemotion work and has neglected their interactions. This is an area that needs to be \nexplored.  \nIndeed, interaction effects between the primary and the secondary dimensions of \nemotion work are a reasonable possibility. For example, surface acting may contribute \nmore strongly to emotional exhaustion if one\u2019s job role additionally requires the very \nfrequent display of prescribed emotions, or the display of high intensity in the expressed \nemotions, or the display of a large number of different emotions; because this means that \nemotional dissonance will be experienced more frequently, more intensely, and the \nemployee will need to switch from the display of one emotion to the display of another \nemotion in a greater number of occasions, respectively. As another illustration, deep acting \nmay become emotionally taxing if the individual also tries to experience intensely the \nemotions she\/he tries to internalize, or if a large variety of emotions need to be \ninternalized; because this will require the deployment of psychological resources in greater \ndegree and in a multitude of occasions, respectively. Therefore, the interactions of surface \nand deep acting with the three secondary dimensions of emotion work should be tested for \ntheir relationship with emotional exhaustion. No such testing has taken place, as yet.  \nHypothesis 2. The interactions of surface acting with the frequency (H2a), intensity \n(H2b) and variety (H2c) of emotional display will be positively related to emotional \nexhaustion. \nBecause no main effect has been hypothesized for deep acting the investigation of the \nrelationships of its interactions with the secondary dimensions of emotion work was posed \nas research question.  \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 8\nResearch question 1. To investigate whether the interactions of deep acting with the \nfrequency, intensity and variety of emotional display are related to emotional exhaustion. If \nrelationships are identified these will be expected to be in the positive direction. \nHowever, apart from their interactions with surface and deep acting, the frequency, \nintensity and variety of emotional display may also interact with each other in their \nrelationships with emotional exhaustion. For example, a service job role that requires the \nintense display of a large variety of emotions may be especially emotionally taxing on \nindividuals who perform it; or a job role that demands the frequent display of a large \nvariety of different emotions may also be particularly taxing on individuals\u2019 emotional \nresources. These are reasonable possibilities that also need to be investigated; as they have \nnot been empirically, or even theoretically, considered as yet.  \nResearch question 2. To investigate the relationship of the interactions between \nfrequency, intensity and variety of emotional display with emotional exhaustion. If \nrelationships are identified these will be expected to be in the positive direction.  \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes \nThe relationship between emotion work and work attitudes has not been empirically \ninvestigated, as yet; though such a relationship has been speculated (Grandey, 2000; \nMorris & Feldman, 1996). \nEmotional exhaustion has been conclusively found to relate to a variety of attitudes \ntowards the job and the organization, including job satisfaction, organizational \ncommitment and turnover intentions (e.g., meta-analysis by Lee & Ashforth, 1996); and is \narguably a causal antecedent of these attitudes (see Cropanzano, Rupp & Byrne, 2003). \nThis well researched issue was not of consideration in the present work.  \nWe saw in detail above that emotional exhaustion has been theoretically considered as \nan outcome of emotion work, and we reviewed the limited empirical evidence that \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 9\ngenerally concurs with this view. Logically, therefore, emotion work should relate to work \nattitudes. There are two reasons to expect such a relationship:  \nFirst, as just seen, work attitudes have been identified as an outcome of emotional \nexhaustion, which, in turn, has been treated as an outcome of emotion work. Therefore, \nemotion work should be indirectly related to work attitudes via its relationship with \nemotional exhaustion. In other terms, emotional exhaustion should mediate the relationship \nbetween emotion work and attitudes towards the job and the organization.  \nSecond, emotion work should be expected to bear a relationship with work attitudes \nindependent of its relationship with emotional exhaustion. For example, performance of a job \nthat requires the consistent display of certain emotions at the expense of actually felt \nemotions should have a negative impact on the job incumbent\u2019s job satisfaction. \nFurthermore, imposition of strict emotional display rules on one\u2019s job may also reflect on the \nattitudes of the job incumbent towards the organization, negatively influencing one\u2019s \ncommitment towards it and one\u2019s intentions to stay with it. This means that apart from the \nindirect relationship, via emotional exhaustion, there should also be a direct relationship \nbetween emotion work and attitudes towards the job and the organization. Therefore, the \nmediating role of emotional exhaustion in the relationship between emotion work and work \nattitudes should be only partial. Hence, the following hypothesis was posed: \nHypothesis 3. Emotional exhaustion will partially mediate the relationship between \nemotion work and work attitudes. More specifically, emotional exhaustion will partially \nmediate the relationship of emotion work with job satisfaction (H3a), organizational \ncommitment (H3b) and turnover intentions (H3c). \nConsidering the above reasoned expectation on the relationship of emotion work with \nwork attitudes, and in direct analogy with the hypotheses and research questions on the \nrelationship of emotion work with emotional exhaustion developed earlier (i.e., \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 10\nHypotheses 1 and 2, and research questions 1 and 2), the following hypotheses and \nresearch questions were also posed: \nHypothesis 4. Surface acting will be negatively related to job satisfaction (H4a) and \norganizational commitment (H4b), and positively related to turnover intentions (H4c).  \nHypothesis 5. The interactions of surface acting with the frequency (H5a), intensity \n(H5b) and variety (H5c) of emotional display will be negatively related to job satisfaction. \nHypothesis 6. The interactions of surface acting with the frequency (H6a), intensity \n(H6b) and variety (H6c) of emotional display will be negatively related to organizational \ncommitment. \nHypothesis 7. The interactions of surface acting with the frequency (H7a), intensity \n(H7b) and variety (H7c) of emotional display will be positively related to turnover \nintentions. \nResearch question 3. To investigate whether the interactions of deep acting with the \nfrequency, intensity and variety of emotional display are related to job satisfaction. If \nrelationships are identified these will be expected to be in the negative direction. \nResearch question 4. To investigate whether the interactions of deep acting with the \nfrequency, intensity and variety of emotional display are related to organizational \ncommitment. If relationships are identified these will be expected to be in the negative \ndirection. \nResearch question 5. To investigate whether the interactions of deep acting with the \nfrequency, intensity and variety of emotional display are related to turnover intentions. If \nrelationships are identified these will be expected to be in the positive direction. \nResearch question 6. To investigate the relationship of the interactions between \nfrequency, intensity and variety of emotional display with job satisfaction, organizational \ncommitment and turnover intentions. The general expectation is that these interactions will \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 11\nbear a negative relationship with job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and a \npositive relationship with turnover intentions.  \nThe National Cultural Setting \nThe present work was set to test a number of mostly untested yet hypotheses and \nresearch questions regarding the relationship of emotion work with emotional exhaustion \nand work attitudes. However, it is considered that an equally important contribution will be \nto conduct this testing in a national cultural context that is different from the one that the \ntheoretical work on emotion work has taken into consideration, and in which the limited \nempirical research has been conducted to date.  \nEmotion work, and its outcomes, has been conceptualized mainly with respect to the \nAnglo-Saxon, and especially the North American, cultural environment (i.e., Ashforth & \nHumphrey, 1993; Hochschild, 1983; Morris & Feldman, 1996; Rafaeli & Sutton, 1990). \nAnd empirical research on correlates of emotion work has been conducted predominantly \nin that cultural environment (Brotheridge & Grandey, 2002; Brotheridge & Lee, 2003; \nGrandey, 2003; Totterdell & Holman, 2003). In addition, the Anglo-Saxon countries are \namongst the most economically developed in the world (e.g., The Economist, 2005; United \nNations, 2005a), and amongst the countries that utilize the most sophisticated customer \nservice techniques globally (see, for example, Tellis, Stremersch.& Yin, 2003; Malhotra, \nAgarwal & Peterson, 1996). There has been some recent confirmatory empirical work \noutside the Anglo-Saxon cultural cluster (Tschan et al., 2005), whose focus, however, bore \nlimited relevance to the focus of the present study. Even that work, however, was \nconducted in Switzerland, also one of the most economically advanced countries in the \nworld, and also a country with a very strong orientation and tradition in customer service \n(e.g., United Nations, 2005a).  \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 12\nTherefore, it is important to conduct research in national cultural contexts that are \ndifferent from the Anglo-Saxon one, and belong to countries that are not yet in the league \nof the most advanced in terms of economic development or in terms of customer service.  \nThe Hellenic service sector as context  \nHellas (also known as Greece) fulfils the above conditions. As it will be illustrated in \ndetail below, in terms of national culture Hellas is substantially different from the Anglo-\nSaxon countries, but also different from the Northern European countries (e.g., Ronen & \nShenkar, 1985; Hofstede, 2001; Trompenaars, 1993); where, as seen, the confirmatory \nempirical research on emotion work has been conducted so far. In addition, Hellas has \nother distinct characteristics that render the Hellenic (Greek) environment a very \nappropriate context for research on correlates and outcomes of emotion work. Indeed, \nauthors (see Rafaeli & Sutton, 1990) have stressed the importance of taking into account \nsocietal emotion display rules as well as the state of development in customer service of \nthe particular country as a means of enhancing our understanding on emotion work. \nThe Hellenic cultural context \nIt appears that two of the cultural dimensions identified by Trompenaars bear \nparticular relevance to the present work. These dimensions are the Specific \u2013 Diffuse and \nthe Affective \u2013 Neutral (Trompenaars, 1993). Tromperaars\u2019 cultural model was deemed \nmore appropriate as a framework for studying emotion work than the other two dominant \ncultural models, namely Hofstede\u2019s and Schwartz\u2019s, because Trompenaars\u2019 cultural \ndimensions focus on how people behave towards each other whilst Hofstede\u2019s and \nSchwartz\u2019s dimensions revolve around values (e.g., Gatley, Lessem & Altman, 1996; \nHofstede & Bond, 1988; Schwartz, 1994; Schwartz & Bilsky, 1987; Trompenaars, 1993). \nEmotion work refers to behaviours towards others and the extent to which these behaviours \nare discrepant from felt emotions; hence, Trompenaars\u2019 dimensions must offer greater \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 13\nassistance in explaining cultural differences in the way emotion work relates to outcomes \nthat are of interest to individuals and organizations.  \nHellas, along with other Southern European countries, is positioned towards the \nDiffuse end of the Specific-Diffuse cultural dimension (see Trompenaars, 1993, p. 88). In \ncontrast, North American countries, the United Kingdom and Northern European \ncountries, where confirmatory empirical work on emotion work has been exclusively \nconducted so far, are positioned towards the Specific end of the dimension. In Specific \nsocieties a clear distinction exists between personal and professional life, and people are \nexpected to adopt particular roles in their professional lives. For example, in Specific \ncultures individuals who work as frontline service workers are expected, and it is highly \nacceptable and endorsable, to \u201cwear\u201d an emotional mask at work. However, it is also \nexpected and endorsed to act in completely different, and more genuine, ways in their \npersonal lives. On the other hand, the distinction between professional and personal life is \nvery loose in cultures that are positioned towards the Diffuse end of the dimension. Such \ncultures endorse the adoption of similar patterns of behaviour at work and in private life. \nTherefore, it can be logically assumed that frontline service employees in societies with \nDiffuse cultures, like Hellas, are less likely to adhere to emotional display rules.  \nRegarding the Affective \u2013 Neutral dimension, Hellas, like other Southern European \ncountries, is positioned towards the Affective end of the continuum (Trompenaars, 1993). \nIn cultures that are positioned towards the Neutral end of the continuum the overt \nexpression of felt emotions is not endorsed and individuals are expected to control and \nsubdue their feelings. In contrast, the overt expression of emotions is endorsed in cultures \nthat are positioned towards the Affective end of the continuum. Individuals in such \nsocieties try to find immediate outlets for their emotions. Hence, it is reasonable to assume \nthat in Affective cultures, like the Hellenic, individuals who occupy frontline service posts \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 14\nwill be inclined to display their actually felt emotions and thoughts when interacting with \ncustomers rather than those emotions that are prescribed by their work roles.   \nConsidering, therefore, the Diffuse and Affective nature of the Hellenic culture it \nwould be expected that individuals who occupy frontline service positions in Hellas do not \nperceive the same pressure and do not expend the same amount of effort to engage in \nemotion work as their counterparts in Specific and Neutral societies. This implies that the \nconsequences of emotion work in Hellas, and in other countries with similar cultural \ncharacteristics, may not be the same as those assumed and found in the extant literature. \nThis renders an empirical investigation on correlates of emotion work in the Hellenic \nfrontline services environment important and necessary; as it can provide valuable insights. \nAs mentioned earlier, specific cultural knowledge, when available, should also be \nutilized in combination with established models of national culture; because, however \ninformative and valid, models of national culture do not contain all necessary information \nfor the understanding and prediction of cultural differences in work behaviour (Hofstede, \n1993; 2001; Smith et al., 2002). Indeed, cultural features that are specific to Hellas further \ncorroborate the above speculations that were based on the Specific and Affective nature of \nthe Hellenic culture.  \nA particular cultural characteristic of Hellas that is pertinent to our discussion is that \nforthrightness is highly valued in the Hellenic society. Having the moral strength or \n\u201cvalour\u201d to express one\u2019s opinion and one\u2019s feelings regardless of the circumstances, and \neven at one\u2019s detriment, is seen as virtue by Hellenes. To the contrary, disguising one\u2019s \nemotions, and especially displaying positive emotions or behaviour (e.g., politeness or \nfriendliness) when negative emotions towards the other party are actually present, is \nscorned. This is seen as \u201cdouble-faced\u201d tactic, especially when the individual engages in it \nfor personal gain, including \u201cwinning\u201d a customer by creating a positive impression of \noneself. In the Hellenic society individuals are expected to \u201cshow what they are\u201d rather \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 15\nthan to display a distorted, however positive, image of themselves. This implies that \nHellenes who engage in frontline service work may be culturally motivated to display their \nactual emotions when they interact with customers instead of those emotions that are \nprescribed by their job roles. \nFinally, another cultural feature of Hellas that is particularly relevant to our case is that \nHellenes have the tendency to react negatively to and to distrust authority (Triandis, \nVassiliou & Nassiakou, 1968; and see also Kakava, 2002). This suggests that Hellenes \nfrontline service employees are more likely to consciously disregard directives from their \nemployer about emotional display rules in interaction with customers.  \nThe Hellenic services context \nHowever, apart from its cultural characteristics, there is another reason that Hellas \noffers a very appropriate context for the study of emotion work. Hellas is at a different \nstage of economic development from the countries in which confirmatory empirical \nresearch on emotion work has been conducted so far. Although it has consistently achieved \ngrowth rates above the European Union average for the last ten years (e.g., European \nCommission, 2006; United Nations, 2005a), and is included in the cluster of developed \ncountries in terms of its performance in the Human Development Index (United Nations, \n2005b), Hellas still lags behind major world economies, including those of the Anglo-\nSaxon and Northern European countries, in terms of economic wealth (e.g., see The \nEconomist, 2005; United Nations, 2005c).  \nIn addition, and most important for our case, customer service orientation in Hellas is \napparently substantially different from the countries in which the bulk of conceptual and \nconfirmatory empirical work on emotion work has taken place. The management \ntechniques utilized in Hellas are generally less cutting-edge that the management \ntechniques utilized in more economically advanced countries (the most comprehensive \nstudy on Hellenic management and business techniques has been conducted by Bourantas \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 16\n& Papadakis, 1997; but see also Eleftheriou & Robertson, 1999), and the idea of customer \nservice in Hellas is different from that in more advanced service oriented economies. In \nparticular, the general attitude among Hellenes service providers is still predominantly \ngeared towards the provision of the product (e.g., material good, financial product, etc.) \nwith less attention paid at the service, in terms of behaviour towards the customer, that \naccompanies that product. As an illustration, a typical frontline bank employee in Hellas \nwould normally perform a required financial transaction with a customer having low \nconcern regarding whether the customer is satisfied with aspects such as his\/her \nfriendliness and politeness, or even conscientiousness and competence. In this respect, \nadherence to emotional display rules is not always seen by frontline workers in the \nHellenic service industry as part of their work role.  \nTherefore, the service industry in Hellas provides a highly appropriate setting for the \nconduction of confirmatory empirical research on emotion work. It is of importance to \ninvestigate whether and the way in which emotion work relates to important outcomes for \nemployees and organizations, such as emotional exhaustion and work attitudes. \nConsidering the information presented above, it is wise to adopt some conservatism \nregarding our expectations on the identification of relationships. If frontline service \nworkers in Hellas do not feel obliged to and are not culturally expected to adhere to \nemotional display rules in their interactions with customers it is likely that engagement in \nemotion work does not have as serious consequences.  \n Method \nParticipants and Procedure \nParticipants were 110 (69 women and 41 men) native Hellenes (Greeks) who were \nemployed on a full-time basis in the Hellenic (Greek) banking sector. All participants were \nperforming frontline service jobs (cashiers and enquiries personnel). Frontline service jobs \nin the banking industry have been identified as involving emotion work (Hochschild, 1983, \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 17\np. 239; Zapf, 2002); hence, individuals performing such jobs provided an appropriate \nsample for the investigation.  \nData were collected by handing questionnaires personally to all frontline employees in \nfour randomly chosen branches of four different banks in the Athens metropolitan area of \nHellas. The directors of these branches had granted permission and supported the study. \nCompleted questionnaires were collected within three days after having been handed.  \nDescriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. Mean age and tenure were 36.78 (SD = \n8.07) and 13.6 (SD = 9.28) years, respectively; and mean tenure in a frontline service job \nwas 10.89 (SD = 8.06) years. Of the participants, 59 were single and 51 were married, and \nmore than half (61 or 55.5%) held undergraduate or postgraduate degrees. \nMeasures \nEmotion work. This was measured with the scale developed by Brotheridge and Lee \n(2003). It consists of 14 items and respondents are asked to imagine themselves on an \n\u201caverage day at work\u201d and indicate the frequency (1: never, 2: rarely, 3: sometimes, 4: \noften, 5: always) with which they engage in a number of actions pertinent to emotion work. \nThe scale contains items that tap the five dimensions of emotion work, namely surface \nacting (three items, e.g., \u201con the average day at work, how frequently do you pretend to \nhave emotions you do not really have?\u201d), deep acting (three items, e.g., \u201con the average \nday at work, how frequently do you try to make an effort to actually feel the emotions that \nyou need to display to others?\u201d), frequency (three items, e.g., \u201con the average day at work, \nhow frequently do you display specific emotions required by your job?\u201d), intensity (two \nitems, e.g., \u201con the average day at work, how frequently do you express intense \nemotions?\u201d), and variety (three items, e.g., \u201con the average day at work, how frequently do \nyou express many different emotions?\u201d). Cronbach alphas were .61, .62, .80, .70 and .70 \nfor surface acting, deep acting, frequency, intensity and variety, respectively. The \ncoefficients for surface and deep acting were lower than those reported by Brotheridge and \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 18\nLee (2003) in their validation studies, but they were still within acceptable limits \n(DeVellis, 1991).  \nEmotional exhaustion. This was measured with the emotional exhaustion scale of the \nMaslach Burnout Inventory (Maslach & Jackson, 1986) that consists of nine items (e.g., \u201cI \nfeel emotionally drained from my work\u201d) and utilizes a 5-point intensity response format \n(1: very little, 5: very much). Cronbach \u03b1 for the present sample was .84. \nJob satisfaction. This was measured with five items in a five-point response format (1: \nstrongly agree, 5: strong disagree). Three items were from Hackman and Oldham\u2019s (1975) \nscale (e.g., \u201cgenerally speaking I am very satisfied with this job\u201d) and two items were from \nGattiker and Larwood\u2019s (1986) scale (e.g., \u201cI am in a position to do mostly work that I \nreally like\u201d). A principal components analysis using the eigenvalues-greater-than-one \ncriterion yielded a single factor with loadings range .58 to .83 and median loading .71; \nindicating that the scale measured a unitary construct. Cronbach \u03b1 was .73.  \nOrganizational commitment. This was measured with Allen and Meyer\u2019s (1990) \naffective organizational commitment scale. Affective or attitudinal organizational \ncommitment reflects the extent to which the employee identifies with, feels attached to and \nis involved in the organization (Meyer & Allen, 1984; Mowday, Steers & Porter, 1979; \nRiketta, 2002); and is shaped by the experiences of individuals within their employing \norganization (Meyer, Stanley, Herscovitch & Topolnytsky, 2002). Hence, affective \norganizational commitment resembles the notion of commitment on which the hypotheses \nand research questions of the present work were built. The scale contains eight items that \nare either positively (e.g., \u201cI really feel as if this organization\u2019s problems are my own\u201d) or \nnegatively stated (e.g., \u201cI do not feel \u2018emotionally attached\u2019 to this organization\u201d) in a 5-\npoint response format (1: strongly disagree, 5: strongly agree). Negatively stated items \nwere reversed in the scoring process. Cronbach \u03b1 for the present sample was .74.  \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 19\nTurnover intentions. This was measured with two items (\u201chow often do you think of \nleaving your present job?\u201d and \u201chow likely is it that you will look for a new job within the \nnext year?\u201d) to which participants responded using a 5-point response format (1: rarely or \nnever, 2: occasionally, 3: sometimes, 4: fairly often, 5: very often). Cronbach \u03b1 was .78. \nControls. Information on a number of personal and work-related demographic \nvariables, which could confound the relationships under investigation (e.g., Cordes & \nDougherty, 1993; Morris & Feldman, 1996), was collected with single items. These \nvariables included respondents\u2019 age, gender (coded 1: male, 2: female), educational \nattainment (coded 1: gymnasium, to 6: postgraduate degree4), marital status (coded 1: \nsingle, 2: married), tenure with the organization, and tenure in a frontline service job.  \nIn order to ensure semantic equivalence between the original, English, version and the \nHellenic version of the scales the translation\/back-translation technique (see Behling & \nLaw, 2000) was employed. The procedure consisted of three steps: In the first step, the full \nquestionnaire was translated to the Hellenic language by an individual who was fluent in \nboth languages; in the second step, the translated questionnaire was translated back to \nEnglish by another bilingual individual; and in the third step, the two English language \nversions of the scales were compared. No major semantic differences were detected and \nsome minor differences were resolved by changing the wording in the Hellenic version of \nthe questionnaire. A pilot of the final questionnaire to a limited number of frontline service \nbank employees suggested that the scales were perfectly intelligible to our target \npopulation.  \nResults \nDescriptive statistics and Person correlation coefficients are presented in Table 1.  \nThe main data-analytic technique was hierarchical regression. One-tailed significance \ntesting was employed, because specific expectations regarding the direction of \nrelationships had been posed. A series of one-way Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs) \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 20\nindicated no significant differences between participants from the four banks in any of the \nvariables that were utilized as criteria in the regressions, namely emotional exhaustion, \nF(3, 106) = .74, ns; job satisfaction, F(3, 106) = 1.65, ns; organizational commitment, F(3, \n106) = 1, ns; and turnover intentions, F(3, 106) = .42, ns. For this reason, bank of \nemployment was not utilized as control in the analysis. \nPredicting Emotional Exhaustion \nHypotheses 1 and 2, and research questions 1 and 2 were tested with a hierarchical \nregression that utilized emotional exhaustion as criterion. Control variables were forcibly \nentered in the first step. To preserve power, considering the large number of interaction \neffects, only those potential controls that demonstrated a significant relationship with \nemotional exhaustion were entered into the regression equation. The inter-correlations \nindicated that age (r = .17, p < .10) was marginally related to emotional exhaustion. \nGender, t (108) = -1.92, p < .10, was also marginally related to emotional exhaustion, with \nwomen participants (M = 2.92, SD = .77) reporting higher emotional exhaustion that male \nparticipants (M = 2.63, SD = .73). Therefore, only age and gender were entered into the \nregression equation as controls.  \nThe five variables that represented the dimensions of emotion work, namely surface \nacting, deep acting, frequency of emotional display, intensity and variety of displayed \nemotions, were entered in the second step. Standard scores were utilized because \ninteraction effects were also investigated (see Dunlap & Kemery, 1987). The three \ninteraction effects of surface acting with the frequency, intensity and variety of emotional \ndisplay were entered in the third step, as they strictly pertained to the testing of Hypothesis \n2. The fourth, and final, step included the block that contained the seven remaining \ninteraction effects, which pertained to the investigation of research questions 1 and 2. \nInteraction effects were operationalized as cross-products of standard scores on the \nrespective variables, e.g., Surface acting x Frequency of emotional display, etc. (Dunlap & \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 21\nKemery, 1987). This transformation increases the accuracy of the estimation of the \ncoefficients of the interaction terms without affecting the estimates of the main effects. The \nstepwise method for variable inclusion into the regression equation was employed for the \nsecond, the third and the fourth block. The stepwise technique selects and retains into the \nfinal regression equation only those predictor variables that make a significant contribution \nto the total regression model (e.g., Draper & Smith, 1981); hence, it improves parsimony \n(Sokal & Rohlf, 1981). As noted, this was especially important in the present study due to \nthe large number of interaction terms. The analytic strategy ensured that in all analyses the \nratio of cases to variables was substantially above the recommended minimum limit (e.g., \nsee Berry & Feldman, 1985). \nThe final regression model is presented in Table 2. Neither scores on surface acting \n(Hypothesis 1) nor scores on any of the other dimensions of emotion work survived the \nstepwise procedure. Hence, Hypothesis 1 was not supported. The interaction of Surface \nacting x Frequency of emotional display made a significant contribution to the total \namount of variance accounted for (\u03b2 = .17, t = 1.8, p < .05), but none of the other \ninteractions of surface acting survived the stepwise procedure. Therefore, Hypothesis 2a \nwas supported, whilst hypotheses 2b and 2c were not supported. The interaction of Deep \nacting x Intensity of displayed emotion made another significant addition to the total \namount of variance accounted for in scores on emotional exhaustion (\u03b2 = .18, t = 1.92, p < \n.05); hence, the investigation of research question 1 yielded a significant relationship. The \ncombined contribution of the emotion work terms to the total amount of variance \naccounted for was significant, F\u0394 (2, 105) = 3.29, p < .05, \u0394R2adj = .038. As none of the \ninteraction terms between the three secondary dimensions of emotion work survived the \nstepwise procedure, the investigation of research question 2 yielded no significant \nrelationships. \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 22\nPredicting Work Attitudes \nHypotheses 4 through 7 and research questions 3 to 6 were tested with three \nhierarchical regressions that followed the same procedure as the regression that tested \nhypotheses 1 and 2, and research questions 1 and 2. Job satisfaction, organizational \ncommitment and turnover intentions were criteria variables in these regressions. The first \nstep in each regression included those controls that were significantly related to each \ncriterion variable, respectively; and were forcibly entered into the regression equation. The \nthree next steps were identical to those in the building of the regression that tested \nhypotheses and research questions 1 and 2. \nEmotion work and job satisfaction \nHypotheses 4a and 5, research question 3, and the first part of research question 6 \npertained to the relationship of emotion work with job satisfaction, which was employed as \nthe criterion variable in the regression equation. No controls were utilized in the \nconstruction of the equation because none of the potential controls (see Table 1), including \ngender, t (108) = -1.23, ns, and marital status, t (108) = -.48, ns, were related to job \nsatisfaction. \nThe regression model is presented in Table 3. Scores on surface acting did not survive \nthe stepwise procedure, neither did scores on any of the other four dimensions of emotion \nwork. Hence, no significant main effects were identified and Hypothesis 4a was not \nsupported. The interaction of Surface acting x Intensity of displayed emotion (\u03b2 = -.19, t = \n-1.98, p < .05) made a significant contribution to the total amount of variance accounted \nfor in scores on job satisfaction. The direction of the relationship was negative, hence, \nHypothesis 5b was supported. The interaction of Intensity x Variety of displayed emotions \nalso survived the stepwise procedure and further added to the total amount of variance \naccounted for (\u03b2 = .16, t = 1.75, p < .05). Therefore, the partial investigation of research \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 23\nquestion 6 yielded a significant relationship. However, the direction of the relationship was \npositive, which was not in line with the expectation. Scrutiny of the interaction effect using \nAiken and West\u2019s (1991) guidelines suggested that although job satisfaction was highest \nwhen both intensity and variety were lowest, as expected, job satisfaction was not lowest at \nthe point that intensity and variety were highest, but in another condition (that of high \nintensity and low variety). Therefore, the expectation on the nature of the interaction effect \nwas only partly supported in this case. The combined contribution of the emotion work \nterms to the total amount of variance accounted for in scores on job satisfaction was \nsignificant, F (2, 107) = 3.45, p < .05, \u0394R2adj = .043. \nHypothesis 3a, which postulated that emotional exhaustion would mediate the \nrelationship of emotion work with job satisfaction, was tested with the procedure \ndeveloped by Kenny and his associates (Baron & Kenny, 1986; Judd & Kenny, 1981). The \nprocedure consists of three stages, each involving the construction of a regression model. \nIn stage (i), the mediator (emotional exhaustion) is regressed on the predictor (emotion \nwork, which was operationalized by means of its five dimensions and their interactions). \nTo progress to the second stage the relationship must be significant. As seen earlier in the \ntesting of hypotheses and research questions 1 and 2, two of the interaction terms of \nemotion work, Surface acting x Frequency and Deep acting x Intensity, made significant \ncontributions to scores on emotional exhaustion, F (2, 105) = 3.29, p < .05, \u0394R2adj = .038. \nThis justified progression to stage (ii) of the procedure that involves regression of the \ncriterion (job satisfaction) on the predictor (emotion work). As seen above, emotion work \nmade a significant contribution to scores on job satisfaction, F (2, 107) = 3.45, p < .05, \n\u0394R2adj = .043. This justified progress into stage (iii) of the procedure, which involves \nhierarchically regressing the criterion (job satisfaction) on both the mediator (emotional \nexhaustion) and the predictor (emotion work). Scores on emotional exhaustion made a \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 24\nsignificant contribution to the amount of variance accounted for in scores on job \nsatisfaction, \u03b2 = -.53, t = -6.55, p < .001; F\u0394 (1, 108) = 33.35, p < .05, \u0394R2adj = .229, and \nemotion work significantly added to that amount, F\u0394 (3, 105) = 4.44, p < .01, \u0394R2adj = \n.067. To infer mediation the amount of variance in the criterion (job satisfaction) \naccounted for by the predictor (emotion work) in the third stage must be lower than in the \nsecond stage. However, in the present case the amount of variance in job satisfaction \naccounted for by emotion work increased in the third stage (i.e., from 4.3% to 6.7% of the \ntotal variance)5. This means that no mediation of emotional exhaustion in the relationship \nof emotion work with job satisfaction can be concluded. Therefore, Hypotheses 3a was not \nsupported.  \nEmotion work and organizational commitment \nHypotheses 4b and 6, research question 4 and the second part of research question 6 \npertained to the relationship of emotion work with organizational commitment, which was \nemployed as the criterion variable in the regression equation. Tenure with the organization \n(r = .27, p < .01) and tenure in a frontline service job (r = .34, p < .001) were significantly \nrelated to organizational commitment and were included in the block of controls. None of \nthe other potential controls, including gender, t (108) = .90, ns, and marital status, t (108) = \n1.3, ns, were related to organizational commitment.  \nThe regression model is presented in Table 3. Surface acting did not survive the \nstepwise procedure to make a significant contribution to the total amount of variance \naccounted for in scores on organizational commitment over and above the contribution of \nthe control block. Hence, Hypothesis 4b was not supported. However, scores on the variety \nof displayed emotions (\u03b2 = -.26, t = -3.09, p < .01) survived the stepwise procedure. \nNone of the interaction terms of surface acting with the secondary dimensions of \nemotion work was included in the regression equation; hence, Hypothesis 6 was not \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 25\nsupported. The interaction of Deep acting x Intensity of displayed emotion (\u03b2 = -.16, t = -\n1.88, p < .05) contributed significantly to the amount of total variance accounted for. \nTherefore, the investigation of research question 4 yielded a significant relationship. The \ninteraction of Intensity x Variety of displayed emotion (\u03b2 = .40, t = 4.85, p < .001) made a \nfurther significant addition to the total amount of variance accounted for. The positive \ndirection of this interaction effect necessitated further scrutiny, as it was not in line with \nthe expected direction. This revealed that organizational commitment was indeed highest \nwhen scores on intensity and variety were lowest, as expected. However, commitment was \nnot lowest when intensity and variety were highest, but in another condition (that of low \nintensity and high variety). Therefore, the investigation of the second part of research \nquestion 6 yielded a significant relationship whose direction was only partly in line with \nexpectations. The combined contribution of all three emotion work terms, main and \ninteraction, was significant, F\u0394 (3, 104) = 10.99, p < .001, \u0394R2adj = .197.  \nHypothesis 3b, which postulated that emotional exhaustion would mediate the \nrelationship of emotion work with organizational commitment, was tested along the lines \nin which Hypothesis 3a was tested. As found in the testing of hypothesis 3a, the condition \nimposed in stage (i), which is common to both hypotheses, was satisfied. Regarding stage \n(ii), as seen above, emotion work made a significant contribution to scores on \norganizational commitment, F (3, 104) = 10.99, p < .001, \u0394R2adj = .197. In stage (iii) \norganizational commitment (the criterion) was hierarchically regressed on emotional \nexhaustion (the mediator) and on emotion work (the predictor), with tenure and tenure in a \nfrontline service job as controls. Emotional exhaustion made a significant contribution to \nthe total amount of variance accounted for, F\u0394 (1, 106) = 19.71, p < .001, \u0394R2adj = .134; \nand emotion work further significantly added to this amount, F\u0394 (3, 103) = 10.26, p < .001, \n\u0394R2adj = .160. The amount of variance in scores on organizational commitment accounted \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 26\nfor by emotion work in stage (iii) was 3.7% lower than in stage (ii), which exceeds the \nrecommended 1% cut-off point (Melamed, 1996). Hence, emotional exhaustion mediates \ntheir relationship. As emotion work still accounted for a significant amount of variance in \nscores on organizational commitment in stage (iii), the mediation is partial. Therefore, \nHypothesis 3b was fully supported.  \nEmotion work and turnover intentions \nHypotheses 4c and 7, research question 5 and the third part of research question 6 \npertained to the relationship of emotion work with turnover intentions, which was \nemployed as the criterion variable in the regression equation. Only tenure in a frontline \nservice job was included in the control block, as it was significantly related to turnover \nintentions (r = -.19, p < .05). None of the other potential control factors (see Table 1), \nincluding gender, t (108) = -.04, ns, and marital status, t (108) = -1.29, ns, were related to \nturnover intentions. \nThe regression model is presented in Table 3. Scores on surface acting survived the \nstepwise procedure and significantly added to the total amount of variance accounted for in \nscores on turnover intentions (\u03b2 = .18, t = 2.01, p < .05). Hence, Hypothesis 4c was \nsupported. Variety of displayed emotions was also included in the regression equation (\u03b2 = \n.23, t = 2.56, p < .05). \nThe interaction term of Surface acting x Intensity of displayed emotion also survived \nthe stepwise procedure (\u03b2 = .22, t = 2.52, p < .01). Therefore, Hypothesis H7b was \nsupported. Finally, the interaction term of Surface acting x Deep acting further added \nsignificantly (\u03b2 = -.30, t = -3.22, p < .01) to the total amount of variance accounted for. The \ncombined contribution of these two interaction terms was significant, F\u0394 (2, 104) = 7.14, p \n< .01, \u0394R2adj = .096; as was the total contribution of the four emotion work terms, main \nand interaction, F\u0394 (4, 104) = 5.78, p < .001, \u0394R2adj = .146. As none of the interactions of \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 27\nDeep acting with the secondary dimensions of emotion work nor any of the interactions \nbetween the secondary dimensions of emotion work survived the stepwise procedure, the \ninvestigation of research question 5 and of the third part of research question 6 did not \nyield significant relationships.  \nFinally, Hypothesis 3c, which postulated that emotional exhaustion would mediate the \nrelationship of emotion work with turnover intentions, was tested along the lines in which \nHypothesis 3a and 3b were tested. As already seen, the condition imposed in stage (i) of \nthe procedure was fulfilled. As found above, emotion work accounted for a significant \namount of variance in scores on turnover intentions, F (4, 104) = 5.78, p < .001, \u0394R2adj = \n.146; which satisfied the condition imposed in stage (ii) of the procedure. Stage (iii) \ninvolved the hierarchical regression of turnover intentions (the criterion) on emotional \nexhaustion (the mediator) and on emotion work (the predictor), with tenure in a frontline \nservice job as control. Emotional exhaustion contributed significantly to the amount of \ntotal variance accounted for, F\u0394 (1, 107) = 17.17, p < .001, \u0394R2adj = .126; and emotion \nwork made a further significant addition to that amount, F\u0394 (4, 103) = 5.21, p < .01, \n\u0394R2adj = .115. The contribution of scores on emotion work to scores on turnover intentions \nin stage (iii) was still significant; and the decrease in the amount of variance (i.e., 3.1%) in \nscores on turnover intentions accounted for by scores on emotion work in stage (iii) from \nstage (ii) was greater than the recommended cut-off point of 1%. Therefore, it was \nconcluded that emotional exhaustion partially mediates the relationship between emotion \nwork and turnover intentions, in full support of Hypothesis 3c. \nDiscussion \nThe present work was set to investigate a number of mostly untested relationships of \nemotion work in a cultural context that was radically different from those in which \nresearch on emotion work had taken place to date. The findings contribute to our \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 28\nunderstanding in three areas: First, the role and importance of interactions between the \ndimensions of emotion work; second, the nature of the relationship of emotion work with \nemotional exhaustion and work attitudes; and third, the role of national culture in the \npattern of the relationship of emotion work with emotional exhaustion and work attitudes.  \nThe study investigated an untested yet issue, which is the role of the interactions \nbetween the dimensions of emotion work. Earlier empirical research had focused \nexclusively on the main effects of the components of emotion work, and especially those \nof the primary components, surface and deep acting. The present work utilized five \nestablished dimensions of emotion work and looked at both their main and their interaction \neffects. In line with earlier reports, neither deep acting nor the three secondary dimensions \nof emotion work were related to emotional exhaustion. But, in contrast to the majority of \nearlier empirical studies, no relationship between surface acting and emotional exhaustion \nwas identified either. This can be accounted for in terms of the cultural context, and it will \nbe discussed later. However, importantly, the results revealed that interactions between the \ndimensions of emotion work were related to emotional exhaustion. In particular, the \nfindings indicated that frequent engagement in surface acting, that is the regular disguise of \nfelt emotions, was especially emotionally taxing. Similarly, engagement in deep acting of \nhigh intensity, that is expending effort to experience strongly the emotions one tries to \ninternalize, was also found to be highly emotionally taxing. These findings are in line with \nthe idea that partly triggered the present study: that it is in fact the combination of different \nemotion work pressures and requirements that impose the major psychological toll on \nemotion workers. To illustrate, although deep acting by itself may not be detrimental, the \nresults suggest that it becomes detrimental when individuals have to experience intensively \nthe emotions they try to internalize. The revelation of the contribution of the interactions is \nvery important because it directs towards viewing the consequences of emotion work under \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 29\na different prism: that of the interplay between its components, instead of solely their main \neffects. As this was the first study to investigate the issue, further research is imperative.  \nThe testing of the relationship of emotion work with work attitudes yielded results that \nwere also largely in line with those on the relationship of emotion work with emotional \nexhaustion. Although main effects were observed in certain cases, interaction effects were \nmore prevalent and they were present in the relationship of emotion work with all three \nwork attitudes that were employed, namely job satisfaction, organizational commitment \nand turnover intentions. The intensity of displayed emotion had a consistent role in the \nrelationship of the two primary dimensions of emotion work, surface acting and deep \nacting, with work attitudes. In particular, the interactions of the intensity of displayed \nemotion with surface acting or deep acting were related to all three work attitudes in the \nexpected direction: high intensity of displayed emotion combined with strong engagement \nin surface acting was associated with lower job satisfaction and stronger intentions to leave \nthe organization; and high intensity of displayed emotion combined with strong deep \nacting was associated with lower organizational commitment. Considering these findings \nalong with the findings on the relationship of emotion work with emotional exhaustion, it \nappears that the intensity of displayed emotion is a prominent secondary dimension of \nemotion work, as it emerged as a consistent moderator of the relationship of the two \nprimary dimensions with both emotional exhaustion and work attitudes. This is in line with \npoints made in the theoretical literature on the key role of the intensity of emotional \ndisplay in the strain imposed by emotion work (Morris & Feldman, 1996).  \nMost of the identified interaction effects were in the expected directions. However, \nthere were two cases of interaction effects whose directions were not fully in line with \nexpectations. These were the interactions between the intensity and the variety of displayed \nemotions in their relationships with job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Job \nsatisfaction and organizational commitment were highest when both intensity and variety \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 30\nof displayed emotions were lowest, as expected; but, contrary to what was expected, the \nlowest levels of job satisfaction and organizational commitment were not located at the \npoints that both intensity and variety of displayed emotions were highest. These partly \ndiscrepant findings can be dismissed as isolated and random (e.g., see Howell, 1987). \nHowever, it is wiser to keep them in mind; as they signal the potential complexity of the \ninterplay between the dimensions of emotion work, and further advocate the importance of \nadditional work to shed light on the nature of this interplay. \nMain effects, though not as numerous as the interaction effects, were also observed in \nthe relationship of emotion work with work attitudes. In particular, the variety of displayed \nemotions, primarily, and surface acting, secondarily, bore relationships with organizational \ncommitment and turnover intentions in the expected directions (i.e., negative and positive, \nrespectively). It should be pointed that it was not surface acting, a primary dimension of \nemotion work, but the variety of displayed emotions, a secondary dimension, that was most \nconsistently related with work attitudes. Taking into account the scarcity of empirical \nresearch with the secondary dimensions of emotion work, the present findings are \nsupportive of the validity and substantive importance of these secondary components; and \nsuggest that future research ought to utilize all identified dimensions of emotion work, \nprimary and secondary. \nThe results also indicated a weak mediating role of emotional exhaustion in the \nrelationship of emotion work with work attitudes. In other terms, the link between emotion \nwork and participants\u2019 attitudes towards their jobs and the organization was mostly direct, \nand largely independent of the relationship of these attitudes with emotional exhaustion. \nThe extent to which this finding can be generalized to other emotion work occupations \nand, especially, to different national cultural contexts, is an issue that must be addressed in \nfuture research. However, this relationship pattern can be explained in terms of the \ncharacteristics of the national cultural context in which the present study was conducted.   \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 31\nAs seen, the Hellenic culture is Affective and Diffuse, with a strong orientation \ntowards forthrightness and a tendency towards resistance to authority. Furthermore, as also \nseen, the attitude of many Hellenes towards service orientation is one of differentiation \nbetween the product offered and the emotional display that accompanies the delivery of \nthat product. The above features of the Hellenic culture would suggest that frontline \nservice workers in Hellas perceive low obligation and possess low motivation to display \nthose emotions towards customers that are considered appropriate for their roles. \nTherefore, it would be less likely to mobilize psychological resources in order to engage in \nemotional display. This means that involvement in frontline service work should not be \nespecially emotionally taxing for Hellenes employees; hence, not strongly linked with \nemotional exhaustion. In support of this explanation was the absence of main effect in the \nrelationship of surface acting with emotional exhaustion, a relationship that has been \nreported in all studies conducted in Anglo-Saxon and Northern European countries.  \nOn the other hand, however, these same cultural characteristics that prevent the \ndevelopment of emotional exhaustion in Hellenes frontline service employees can be \nresponsible for the development of negative views towards their jobs and employing \norganization. Although they may not feel particular pressure to comply with emotion work \nrequirements Hellenes frontline service workers should resent the fact that they perform a \njob that has emotional display rules and necessitates, at least sometimes, the violation of \nthe culturally valued principles of forthrightness and genuine expression of felt emotions. \nThis should naturally lead to the formation of negative attitudes towards their jobs; hence, \nto a decrease in job satisfaction and a heightened desire to quit the job. Furthermore, \nemotional display rules are designed, endorsed and imposed by the management of the \norganization who is a source of authority, which, as seen, is generally viewed with \nnegativity by Hellenes. Therefore, Hellenes who engage in frontline service work should \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 32\nbe more likely to form unfavourable attitudes towards their employing organization and, \nhence, report lower commitment towards it as well as higher desire to leave.  \nThe above culture-based accounts offer an apparently plausible explanation for the \nrelationship pattern that was observed in the present study:  the direct link of emotion work \nwith work attitudes, with only weak mediation by emotional exhaustion. It appears that \nHellenes who engage in frontline service work are likely to form negative attitudes towards \ntheir jobs and employing organization not because emotion work exhausts them, but \nmainly because frontline service work imposes display rules that are incompatible with \ndeeply entrenched cultural values.   \nFrom a human resource management point of view the study suggests that in the \nHellenic context, and by extrapolation in national cultural contexts that resemble it, \nemotion work is associated with undesirable phenomena for organizations. At this point, it \nis important to stress once more that the present study indicated that undesired outcomes of \nemotion work were only marginally related to emotional exhaustion; as emotional \nexhaustion weakly mediated the relationship of emotion work with work attitudes. \nTherefore, according to our findings, to limit the negative phenomena that are associated \nwith emotion work organizations that operate in Hellas should not direct their policies \ntowards emotional exhaustion; but either towards the nature of emotion work itself or \ndirectly towards the improvement of work attitudes. Although our knowledge on emotion \nwork is still limited, potential human resource practices can include: the provision of \ninformation to frontline employees on the nature of emotion work; mentoring by senior \ncolleagues or more experienced peers (e.g., Eby, 1997; King, Xia, Campbell-Quick & \nSethi, 2005; van Emmerik, 2004); and the design of frontline service work in a way that \nreduces the demands on intensity, variety and frequency of emotional display (taking into \naccount that our results suggest that these are the demands that are mostly related to \nnegative outcomes rather than the sheer fact that employees are required to act in their \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 33\nencounters with customers). Such specific-to-emotion-work human resource systems could \nbe supplemented by practices that are traditionally utilized as means against negative work \nattitudes and voluntary turnover, for example, fairly designed and managed reward \nsystems, and opportunities for development (e.g., Chen, Chang & Yeh, 2004).  \nLimitations \nThe cross-sectional nature of the investigation does not allow strong assertions on \ncausality regardless of the sophistication of data analytic techniques (e.g., Bozionelos, \n2003). Furthermore, exclusive utilization of the self-report method invites the possibility of \ncommon method bias, which may be associated with inflation or deflation of the identified \nrelationships (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee & Podsakoff, 2003). Although sound \nquantitative review work (Crampton & Wagner, 1994) demonstrated that the likelihood of \nobtaining biased coefficients due to self-reports is much lower than generally believed, \nprecautions were still taken to reduce this possibility. These precautions included assuring \nparticipants on the anonymity of responses and stating in the instructions that there were no \ncorrect or incorrect answers (Podsakoff et al., 2003; and see Schmitt, 1994). Nevertheless, \nmulti-source methodologies are encouraged, when feasible.  \nInternal consistency reliabilities for two of the dimensions of emotion work were only \nmarginally acceptable. These low reliabilities cannot be easily attributed to sub-optimal \ntranslation of the scales because low internal consistencies were observed only with two of \nthe five dimensions of emotion work. Furthermore, a drop in the value of alpha coefficients \nis not uncommon in measure transfer across linguistic and cultural groups (e.g., Helseth & \nLund, 2005; Lee, Allen & Meyer, 2001). Nevertheless, these marginal internal \nconsistencies should be kept in mind. As a more general note, it appears that additional \nwork is needed towards the development and validation of emotion work measures. For \nexample, along with individuals whose jobs involved emotion work, Brotheridge and Lee\u2019s \nvalidation samples also included full-time students and individuals who did not perform \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 34\njobs that involve emotion work (see Brotheridge & Lee, 2003, pp. 368-374). The present \nstudy utilized exclusively full-time employees whose jobs involved emotion work. This \ndiscrepancy in the nature of samples could be responsible for the differences in internal \nconsistency reliabilities.  \nThe relatively small sample size also needs to be mentioned. At this point it should be \nreiterated that the ratio of cases to variables was always above the limits that permit valid \nstatistical conclusions. Furthermore, it is not the sample size that determines the \napplicability of statistical conclusions to the population under consideration; but rather the \nextent to which the sample is representative of that population (e.g., Best, Krueger, \nHubbard & Smith, 2001; Forster, 2000; Scheaffer, Mendenhall & Ott, 1990). Although we \ncannot be certain that the sample was representative of the population of frontline \nemployees in the Hellenic banking sector, the fact that participants were frontline service \nemployees from different banks in different locations provides some confidence in this \nrespect. \nFinally, the study was conducted in the frontline services environment of the banking \nsector. The extent to which the findings are generalizable to other occupations that involve \nperformance of emotion work (e.g., waiters, cabin crew personnel, health professionals) is \nan issue that needs to be investigated in future research.  \nThe present work indicated the importance of considering all dimensions of emotion \nwork and, especially, their interactions. In addition, it suggested a link between national \ncultural features and the nature of the relationship of emotion work with outcomes of \nimportance to both employees and organizations. The latter implies that optimal ways to \ndeal with negative phenomena associated with emotion work vary across national contexts. \nTaking into account the scarcity of empirical confirmatory research on emotion work, it is \nimperative that further research is conducted in various national cultural environments; so \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 35\ncultural differences in the way emotion work relates to important outcomes are identified, \nand culturally optimal human resource practices are formulated.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReferences \nAiken, L.

However, the present work \nadhered to the original or traditional meaning of the construct as pertinent exclusively to \ninteractions with customers. Empirical findings indicate that the requirement for displaying \nprescribed emotions is substantially greater (by a factor of three) in interactions with \ncustomers than in interactions with co-workers (Tschan et al., 2005).  \n3These two studies, by Brotheridge and Grandey (2002) and by Brotheridge and Lee \n(2003), utilized the same sample and measured four of the dimensions of emotion work \nwith identical scales (only the assessment of frequency of emotional display was \naccomplished with different items, see Brotheridge & Grandey, 2002, pp. 23-24 and pp. \n34-35, and Brotheridge & Lee, 2003, pp. 369-370). To avoid misunderstandings, the \nstudies had different aims. However, the parts of these studies that are pertinent to the \npresent work are identical, hence, their respective findings are treated as a single report.  \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 44\n4The Hellenic educational system is structured as following: elementary school (six \nyears duration); gymnasium (three years duration; equivalent to junior high-school); \nlyceum (three years duration; equivalent to senior high-school); technical\/vocational \neducation (variable duration; leads to a technical\/vocational qualification); higher \neducation (three to four years duration; equivalent to a Polytechnic or two\/three-year \nCollege degree); highest education (four to five years duration; equivalent to a University \nor College degree); and postgraduate education. Attendance of education up to Gymnasium \nlevel is compulsory, hence, this was the minimal educational qualification included in the \nquestionnaire. \n5This increase in the amount of variance accounted for by a set of predictors after the \naddition of what is in essence a control variable (emotional exhaustion in the present case) \nmust not be seen with surprise or suspicion. It can be explained by means of the \nrelationship between the new variable in the equation and the other predictor variables, \nwhich can result in changes in the relationship of the latter with the criterion (e.g., see \nHowell, 1987). \n \nEmotion Work and Work Attitudes in Hellas 45 \nTable 1 \nDescriptive statistics and intercorrelations (N = 110). \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n           M      SD      1   2    3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n1.
