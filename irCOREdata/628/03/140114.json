Post-project reviews\n(PPRs) are recognized by both practitioners and academics as an appropriate\nmechanism to stimulate and capture learning in NPD teams. However, relatively few\ncompanies use PPRs, and those that do utilize them often fail to do so effectively.\nAlthough they are widely perceived to be a useful tool, empirical research on how\nPPRs are typically organized and the learning that results is limited.\nThis article addresses this gap in the extant knowledge and describes five in-\ndepth case studies, which were conducted at leading companies in Germany. A\ndetailed investigation was made of how PPRs are conducted, and the type of learning\nthat can result. Three main sources of data were used for each case: company\ndocumentation; in-depth interviews with managers responsible for NPD; and\nobservation of an actual PPR. The different data sources enabled extensive\ntriangulation of data to be conducted and a high degree of reliability and validity to be\nachieved.\nThe analysis enabled a number of key characteristics of the way PPRs are\nmanaged to be identified. Various characteristics of PPRs influence their utility, such\nas the time at which they take place and the way discussions are moderated. In\naddition, the data show that participants in the discussions at PPRs often use\nmetaphors and stories, which indicates that PPRs have the potential to generate tacit\nknowledge. Interestingly, the data also showed that there are various different ways in\nwhich metaphors and stories appear to stimulate discussions on NPD projects.\nBased on the cross-case analysis, a wide range of implications are identified.\nResearchers need to investigate PPRs further to identify how they can generate tacit\nand explicit knowledge and support project-to-project learning. Especially the topic\nof tacit knowledge generation in a NPD context needs further investigation. The\nresearch also led to a range of recommendations for practitioners. Companies need to\nstrongly communicate the purpose and value of PPRs, run them effectively to\nstimulate the maximum possible learning, and disseminate the findings widely. PPRs\nhave the potential to create and transfer knowledge amongst NPD professionals but,\nas they are seldom currently used, many companies are missing an important\nopportunity.\n1BIOGRAPHIES\nUrsula Koners has experience in R&D management at DaimlerChrysler and is\ncurrently a project manager for a German publisher. During the last five years she\nstudied part-time for a PhD in management at Cranfield and successfully defended\nher thesis in January 2006. Her research on post-project reviews has been\nsuccessfully presented at a number of conferences and she has published one previous\npaper, in Creativity and Innovation Management.\nKeith Goffin is professor of innovation and new product development at Cranfield\nSchool of Management, UK. Prior to joining Cranfield, he worked for fourteen years\nin marketing and new product development for Hewlett-Packard. His research\ninterests are in new methods of market research, supplier management, and\nknowledge management in R&D. He has published extensively and his latest book,\nInnovation Management: Strategy and Implementation Using the Pentathlon\nFramework was published by Palgrave in 2005.\n2INTRODUCTION\nA valuable way to capture knowledge generated during the course of a new product\ndevelopment (NPD) project is to hold a post-project review (PPR). This is \u201ca formal\nreview of the project which examines the lessons which may be learnt and used to the\nbenefit of future projects\u201d (Lane, 2000). PPRs are also called \u2018post-mortems\u2019 (Collier,\net al, 1996), and they can help companies prevent similar mistakes being made to\nthose in previous NPD projects (Tidd et al, 1997). Although the importance of PPRs\nis frequently stressed by practitioners and academics alike, organizations responsible\nfor NPD rarely conduct PPRs\u2014as shown by a wide body of anecdotal evidence and a\nfew empirical studies (e.g. Bowen et al, 1994; Huber, 1996; Saban et al, 2000).\nRigorous research into how PPRs are typically conducted, or the learning that can\noccur, is scarce.\nThe range of the literature that is relevant to the study of PPRs is wide; both\nthe NPD and project management literature give useful pointers. In addition,\norganizational learning theory is pertinent but, surprisingly, most researchers working\nin the NPD context have failed to apply the knowledge from this literature. This\narticle starts by reviewing all three areas to identify gaps and gain insights into\nsuitable methodologies for studying PPRs. Next, it explains the logic for choosing\ncase study methodology and the actions taken to ensure validity and reliability. The\nresults from the five exploratory cases are then presented. Finally, conclusions are\ndrawn and implications are identified for NPD practitioners and academics alike.\nREVIEW OF THE EXTANT LITERATURE\nNPD Literature\nKnowledge has become recognized as a major source of long-term competitive\nadvantage in research and development\u2014R&D (Corso et al, 2001). It should be noted\nthat R&D departments conduct both basic research projects (e.g. investigating new\ntechnology) and product development. PPRs can be conducted at the end of either\ntype of project but this article focuses on NPD. The importance of learning from NPD\nprojects has been emphasized by several authors (e.g. Leonard-Barton, 1992;\nLiyanage et al, 1991). A number of researchers have recognized that very few\ncompanies use PPRs (Bourgault and Sicotte, 1998; Bowen et al, 1994; Wheelwright\n3and Clark, 1992) but only two have demonstrated this empirically. One study showed\nthat two out of 33 microelectronic manufacturers used formal PPRs (Boag and\nRinholm, 1998). Goffin and Pfeiffer (1999) found that only four of their 16 case\nstudy companies conducted PPRs but failed to give details on how they were used.\nThe weak empirical basis of our knowledge of PPRs in the NPD context is\ndemonstrated by Table 1, which shows the main studies listed in chronological order.\nIt can be seen that these studies are either based on single case studies or rely on\nsingle data sources (e.g. interviews). There have been a number of articles in the\nliterature which focus on software projects (e.g. Abel-Hamid, 1990) and one of these\nis included in Table 1 (Pitman, 1991). Unfortunately, the articles on software all make\nrecommendations based solely on the authors\u2019 opinions without providing any\nempirical evidence.\nAll of the studies in Table 1 include observations and recommendations on\nhow PPRs should be conducted. These are placed in 14 categories connected with\norganizing PPRs and disseminating the results. For example, four articles (Pitman,\n1991; Wheelwright and Clark, 1992; Lilly and Porter, 2003; Von Zedtwitz, 2003)\nstress the need for clear objectives to be set for PPRs. Interestingly, only Sinofsky\nand Thomke (1996) make a recommendation on the appropriate duration for a PPR.\nReviewing the findings of the previous studies shows that several of them identify\nonly a few points (e.g. Ayas, 1996) whereas others make up to eight\nrecommendations (Sinofsky and Thomke, 1996; Von Zedtwitz, 2003). No single\narticle has identified all of the categories. The later studies (Lilly and Porter, 2003;\nVon Zedtwitz, 2003) do identify more points than some of the earlier studies but\nTable 1 demonstrates that these researchers have not taken sufficient account of prior\nresearch because they have overlooked several points, such as the duration of PPRs\nand the discussion method.\nMost researchers have ignored learning theory when looking at knowledge\ncreation in NPD (McKee, 1992) and this is the case for the studies in Table 1. All of\nthem focus on knowledge that can be documented and easily shared and fail to\nrecognize that there is more to learning than that which is documented in written\nreports. This point will be discussed further after a review of the project management\nliterature.\n5Study Pitman (1991) Wheelwright &\nClark (1992)\nAyas (1997) Duarte & Snyder\n(1997)\nSinofsky &\nThomke (1999)\nLilly & Porter\n(2003)\nVon Zedtwitz\n(2003)\nEmpirical basis Personal\nexperience of\nauthor of\nsoftware\nprojects\nVarious case\nstudies\nCase study from\naircraft\nmanufacturing\nindustry\nSingle case study\nat Whirlpool\nCorporation\nExamples from\nMicrosoft and\nother software\ndevelopers\nTwo stage\nresearch in various\norganizations\nConvenience\nsample of 63 R&D\nmanagers plus\ninterviews at 13\ncompanies\nMethodology used \uf0b7No details\ngiven\n\uf0b7No details\ngiven\n\uf0b7 \u201cAction\nresearch\u201d\n\uf0b7No further\ndetails given\n\uf0b7Action research\n\uf0b7Claims to use a\nmodel from\norganizational\nlearning \u2013 but it\nis unclear how\n\uf0b7 No details given \uf0b7Exploratory\ninterviews with\n16 NPD\nmanagers in 8\norganizations.\n\uf0b7Mail survey\nacross 49\ncompanies\n\uf0b7Focus on explicit\nknowledge\n\uf0b7Survey\nquestionnaire\n\uf0b7Qualitative\nfeedback from\ninterviewees\n1 Objective of PPRs \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a\n2 Timing of PPRs \u221a \u221a\n3 Duration of PPRs \u221a\n4 PPR participants \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a\n5 Moderation of PPRs \u221a \u221a\n6 PPR discussion method \u221a \u221a\n7 Location for PPR \u221a \u221a\n8 Use of guidelines for\nPPRs\n\u221a\n9 Preparation of PPRs \u221a \u221a \u221a\n10 Atmosphere during PPRs \u221a \u221a\n11 Results of PPRs \u221a \u221a \u221a\n12 Dissemination of PPR\nresults\n\u221a \u221a \u221a\n13 Creation of action points \u221a \u221a\n14 Agreement on\nimprovement suggestions\n\u221a \u221a\nTable 1: PPR Studies from the NPD Literature\n6Project Management Literature\nThe need to review project activities in a formal and structured manner became\napparent at the end of the 1950s\uf0beparallel to the emergence of the project\nmanagement discipline itself (Weinberg and Freedman, 1984). Later,\nrecommendations started to appear on how to conduct PPRs (e.g. Gulliver, 1987).\nSurprisingly, considering their advantages, the adoption of PPRs has been slow and it\nis interesting to note that it was only the 2000 edition of the well-known Project\nManagement Body of Knowledge that first gave advice on how reviews should be\ncarried out (Project Management Institute, 2000)\nTable 2 gives an overview of the five main publications in the project\nmanagement literature, using the same categories as in Table 1. It can be seen that\nfewer points have been identified in the project management literature and for\nexample, there are no observations on the appropriate timing and duration of PPRs.\nUnfortunately, the recommendations in several articles are quite vague and difficult to\napply (e.g. \u201cencourage deep analysis\u201d or \u201cdiscourage glib categorization\u201d are not\nexplained in Busby\u2019s 1999 article). The validity of the project management research\nis also questionable because how data were collected and exactly how the conclusions\nwere reached is unclear in most of the articles. For example, although Schindler and\nEppler (2003) claim to have conducted action research in nine companies, their article\ndoes not indicate that the accepted approaches for action research were followed. The\narticle gives no indication of the similarities and differences in the views of the 46\nrespondents interviewed. In addition, as no PPRs were observed, the manager-\nreported data were not triangulated. Collating the methodologies of previous studies\n(e.g. combining Busby\u2019s idea of observing PPRs with Schindler and Eppler\u2019s in-depth\ninterviewing) appears a potentially more valid way to investigate PPRs.\n7Study Freedman & Weinberg\n(1977)\nBaird et al (1999) Busby (1999) Right Track\nAssociates (2000)\nSchindler & Eppler\n(2003)\nEmpirical basis Personal experiences of\nauthors\nAnecdotal examples\nfrom US Army projects\n4 PPRs in 3 different\ncapital equipment\norganizations\nPractical consulting\nexperience\nAction research in\nnine multinational\ncompanies\nMethodology used \uf0a7 No details provided \uf0a7 No details given,\nonly discusses how\nthe guidelines could\nbe used by\ncompanies\n\uf0a7 PPRs were\nobserved and\ndiscourse analysis\nwas performed\n\uf0a7 It is unclear\nwhether the study\nwas systematically\nconducted\n\uf0a7 No clear link\nbetween the\nfindings and the\nrecommendations\n\uf0a7 No details given \uf0a7 46 Semi-\nstructured\nexpert interviews\n\uf0a7 Half-day follow-\nup workshops\n\uf0a7 Gives almost no\ndetails of the\nmethodology\n\uf0a7 Apparently no\nuse of the\nrecognised\napproaches to\naction research\n1 Objective of PPRs\n2 Timing of PPRs\n3 Duration of PPRs\n4 PPR participants \u221a \u221a\n5 Moderation of PPRs \u221a\n6 PPR discussion method \u221a \u221a \u221a\n7 Location for PPRs\n8 Use of guidelines for PPRs\n9 Preparation of PPRs \u221a \u221a\n10 Atmosphere during PPRs \u221a \u221a\n11 Results of PPRs \u221a \u221a \u221a\n12 Dissemination of PPR results \u221a \u221a \u221a\n13 Creation of action points \u221a\n14 Agreement on improvement\nsuggestions\nTable 2: PPR Studies from the Project Management Literature\n8Organizational Learning\nIn the investigation of PPRs, both the NPD and project management literatures focus\non knowledge that can be easily shared and documented. This is a limitation as there\ncan be more to learning than what is documented in project reports. Here, the\norganizational learning literature can provide insights, as it focuses on the concept of\n\u201cknowledge\u201d, which has been heavily influenced by the work of Nonaka (1994). His\nideas relate back to Polanyi (1962) and his famous quote that \u201cwe can know more\nthan we can tell\u201d. This indicates that there are two types of knowledge: \u201cexplicit\u201d and\n\u201ctacit\u201d. Explicit knowledge is what we can readily explain and document, whereas\ntacit knowledge is difficult to articulate and exists at a subconscious level. Nonaka\nidentified that social interactions are essential for knowledge transfer and the transfer\nof tacit knowledge is an essential component of learning complex tasks (Nonaka,\n1996).\nTacit knowledge can only be transferred through detailed discussions among\npeople from similar backgrounds and with common experiences. Communities of\nPractice (CoPs) are groups of people who are informally bound to one another by\nexposure to a common class of problems (Wenger and Snyder, 2000). This exposure\nleads to a high degree of common knowledge, understanding and language, and\nexperience which supports the efficient transfer of knowledge. Project teams can be\nconsidered an embryonic form of a CoP (Sense and Antoni, 2003). CoPs theory views\nlearning as a social phenomenon and claims that knowledge \u2013 and in particular tacit\nknowledge - can only be produced and held collectively (Howells, 1996).\nIt should be noted that there is some controversy on tacit knowledge and\nwhether it can be converted into explicit knowledge has been disputed (Cook and\nBrown, 1999). However, the discussion in the literature has largely been at a\ntheoretical level and unfortunately has failed to make empirical inroads into the\nunderstanding of tacit knowledge. Therefore, the main problem with attempting to\napply the concepts from the organizational learning literature to NPD is the difficulty\nto operationalize tacit knowledge. By definition, tacit knowledge cannot be clearly\nexpressed, documented, or observed and so it is necessary to use special data\ncollection and analysis techniques. Metaphors and stories have been recognized in the\nliterature as indicators of the generation and exchange of tacit knowledge (Cook and\nBrown, 1999; Nonaka, 1994).\n9Metaphors and stories appear to be a useful starting point to understand the\nexchange of tacit knowledge; however, specific studies of metaphors and stories are\nrare. Another approach from psychology\uf0berepertory grid technique, which will be\ndiscussed later\uf0beappears to access tacit knowledge (Goffin, 2002; Reed, 2000).\nHowever, studying tacit knowledge empirically is a problem area (Wong and\nRadcliffe, 2000).\nConclusions on the Literature\nThe review of the different areas of literature relevant to PPRs showed:\n\uf0b7 A number of characteristics of PPRs have been identified but no previous study\nhas consolidated our understanding;\n\uf0b7 There is a need for systematic investigation, using multiple data sources to\ndetermine how PPRs are actually conducted and to identify what influences their\nutility;\n\uf0b7 Knowledge has both explicit and tacit dimensions, which need to be considered.\nRESEARCH DESIGN\nThe gaps identified in the literature and the insights gained from organizational\nlearning theory led to a detailed study of PPRs. This addressed a number of research\nquestions, two of which are considered in this article:\n\uf0b7 How do R&D organizations conduct post-project reviews?\n\uf0b7 Do PPRs promote the creation and transfer of tacit knowledge?\nChoice of Case Study Methodology\nAs there has been limited previous research, this study was exploratory in nature and\nin-depth case studies were selected for three main reasons. Firstly, case studies are\nappropriate when conducting exploratory research on complex social phenomena in\nreal-life contexts (Eisenhard, 1989; Yin, 1994). Secondly, they allow researchers to\nobserve formal as well as informal processes (e.g. social interactions) within an\norganization and collect a wide array of data (Hartley, 1994). Thirdly, R&D managers\nhave been found to be positively inclined to case study research (Gassmann, 1999).\nHowever, in choosing case study methodology, the researchers recognized that the\nstudy needed to be carefully designed to ensure sufficient rigour.\n10\nData Sources\nThe most important issues in achieving high-quality case study design are construct\nvalidity and internal validity (Easton, 1995; Miles and Huberman, 1994). Construct\nvalidity is related to choosing appropriate constructs for the topic and establishing\nsuitable operational measures for the concepts being studied (Mason and Bramble,\n1989). This was largely achieved by using a technique\u2014repertory grid\u2014in which\ninterviewees both identify and explain the key constructs themselves. A semi-\nstructured questionnaire was also used for the interviews and this was based on the\nwork of previous researchers and included questions probing each of the 14 key\ncharacteristics of PPRs (as shown in Tables 1 and 2).\nInternal validity refers to the reliability of a study (Dane, 1990) and, in order\nto maximize internal validity, multiple sources of data were used. This is in contrast\nto previous studies, most of which did not take the opportunity to triangulate data.\nFigure 1 gives an overview of the three data sources:\n\uf0b7 Company Documents. Copies of company confidential documents on both the\nprocess of conducting PPRs and minutes from specific PPRs were obtained and a\ncontent analysis was conducted. Documents were coded according to categories\nidentified from the literature. Secondly, documents were coded for any \u201clessons\nlearned\u201d mentioned. Obviously, lessons learned that are documented reflect\nexplicit knowledge and so documents were also checked to see if they recorded\nthe use of metaphors and stories;\nFigure 1: Multi-Faceted Design of Case Studies\nDOCUMENTS INTERVIEWS OBSERVATIONS\nGuidelines\nfor PPRs\nMinutes of\nPPRs\nRepertory\nGrids\nInterview\nTranscripts\nNotes on\nObservations\nTranscripts\nof Meetings\nRepertory\nGrid\nMatrices\nSemi-\nstructured\nPPR\nMeeting\nData\nSources\nData\nCollection\n11\n\uf0b7 Interviews. At each company six interviews were conducted with R&D managers\nor project participants who were actively involved in NPD. Interviewees were\nchosen in conjunction with the case companies, to include a range of levels of\nexperience. Each interview was firstly based on repertory grid technique. This\ntechnique is especially useful in exploratory research settings where interviewees\nfind it hard to articulate their views or where bias is an issue (Goffin, 2002).\nRespondents were asked to name six projects in which they had participated in the\npast (the elements of the repertory grid technique) and these were written on\nnumbered cards. Groups of three cards, selected randomly, were presented to the\ninterviewee with the question: \u201cLooking at the three projects written on the cards\n\u2013 how are two of these projects similar and different to the third in terms of what\nyou would do differently if you were doing the projects again.\u201d Answers to this\nquestion elicited what are called constructs in repertory grid terminology. These\nare the key attributes of the subject under investigation \u2013 in this study \u201clessons\nlearned\u201d from completed projects (our findings on the typical types of lessons\nlearnt have been reported elsewhere: Koners and Goffin, 2005). The particular\nadvantage of repertory grid technique is that it forces the respondent to think\ndeeply and probes their tacit knowledge. In addition, semi-structured questions on\nPPR practices were asked (based on the topics in the literature). Typical questions\nincluded \u201cwhen are PPRs normally conducted at your company?\u201d (probing for\nthe timing of PPRs) and \u201cwho typically takes part in PPRs?\u201d (to identify the\ntypical participants). Both the repertory grid and semi-structured section of the\ninterviews were piloted.\n\uf0b7 PPR Observation. A PPR was observed (and recorded) at four from the five\ncompanies and these were analyzed for metaphors and stories using Nonaka\u2019s\nrecommendations. Also attention was paid to the interaction of PPR participants\nas a potential evidence for tacit knowledge creation and transfer.\nThe collection of data per case typically required 5 non-consecutive days of on-site\nvisits. The participating companies were promised feedback on their PPR processes\nand this was completed through either a written report with recommendations (in one\ncase) or an additional on-site visit and presentation by the researchers (four cases).\nSample\n12\nThe sampling frame chosen was the 50 largest companies in south Germany. This is\nconsidered to be Europe\u2019s leading high-tech region because of its high level of R&D\ninvestment and the highest number of patents generated (Staatsministerium Baden-\nW\u00fcrttemberg, 2001). Companies were contacted in writing and from the minority that\nwere found to conduct PPRs, five companies from different industries agreed to the\nstudy. Companies from different sectors were chosen to avoid having direct\ncompetitors in the final sample (an important aspect in establishing trust and gaining\nco-operation). The five companies will, for reasons of confidentiality, be designated\nEngineeringCo, AppliancesCo, MedCareCo, MachineryCo and PublishingCo, (the\npseudonyms indicate the sector in which they are active). Table 3 gives an overview\nof the sample companies and the data collected at each site. Data collection was\nconducted by a native German backed by a non-native fluent German speaker.\nEngineeringCo was used as a pilot, during which the analysis frameworks were\ngenerated and verified. In later cases, due to the experience with the pilot, data\ncollection was more focused and a number of questions were omitted from\ninterviews. This means that the available data and the analysis used were consistent\nacross the five cases.\nCompanies Turnover Employees\n(approx)\nPPR Guidelines\n(NPD process\ndocumentation)\nMinutes of\nSpecific PPRs\nInspected?\nR&D Interviews\nConducted?\nObservation of a\nPPR?\nEngineeringCo > 1 Billion\nEuro\n5.000 Yes Yes, 4 sets\n(copies made)\nYes - 6 Yes\nAppliancesCo 1,5 Billion\nEuro\n7.000 Yes Yes, 3 sets\n(copies made)\nYes \u2013 6 Yes\nMedcareCo 1,3 Billion\nEuro\n10.000 Yes Yes, 3 sets (on-\nsite inspection)\nYes \u2013 6 Yes\nMachineryCo 400 Million\nEuro\n3,000 Yes Yes, 4 sets (on-\nsite inspection)\nYes \u2013 6 Yes\nPublishingCo 300 Million\nEuro\n2.000 Yes Yes, 5 sets\n(copies made)\nYes \u2013 6 No (company\nrefused access)\nTotal = 19 Total = 30\nTable 3: Overview of Sample and Data Availability\nData Analysis\nCase analysis was conducted in three main stages, following the recommendations of\nMiles and Huberman (1994):\n\uf0b7 Within case analysis. Data from each case were analyzed separately to give a\ncomplete picture of the company\u2019s approach to PPRs. The same data analysis\nframework was used for each case. For example, to understand PPR practices,\nevidence from the different interviews was collated and then triangulated with both\n13\nevidence from the documentation and the observation of a PPR. (Copies of the\ncoding and analysis frameworks are available from the authors.)\n\uf0b7 Data reduction. This was performed and 2-3 page case descriptions were written on\neach company. The descriptions were then submitted to informants at the case\ncompanies to check that they did not contain information that was likely to\ncompromise their NPD plans. Secondly, informants checked the detail given in the\ncase description\u2014and a number of small corrections were made. Such feedback\nfrom informants is essential to prevent observer bias (Lincoln and Guba, 1985) and\nin establishing the credibility of an interpretation (Wallendorf and Belk, 1989).\n\uf0b7 Cross-case analysis. Comparisons across the five companies were made, to\ndetermine where similarities and differences existed and to identify a number of\n\u201cbest practices\u201d (Yin, 1994).\nRESULTS: CROSS-CASE ANALYSIS\nCharacteristics of PPRs\nTable 4 summarizes how PPRs are organized at the case companies. The data\ncollected allowed a comprehensive picture of how PPRs are conducted to emerge.\nThe 14 categories identified from the literature were used as the framework for both\ndata analysis and presentation and, within each of the categories, the data sources\nused are indicated. For example, to get a detailed and valid understanding of the\nobjectives of PPRs, data from guidelines, minutes of specific PPRs, interview\ntranscripts and the observations of PPRs were triangulated. Several of the categories\nshown in Table 4 will be discussed, in order to demonstrate how the conclusions were\nreached.\n14\nCharacteristics of\nPPRs \u2013 14\nCategories\nData Sources Used per\nCategory\nEngineeringCo AppliancesCo MedCareCo MachineryCo PublishingCo Conclusions\n1.

However, in interviews it also emerged that PPRs were\nperceived by participants to be an important part of project \u201cclosure\u201d; where the\nresponsibility moves from R&D to other departments, notably manufacturing and\nmarketing. Interestingly, none of the companies\u2019 official processes recognized the\nimportance of PPRs for dissemination of knowledge. Making this an objective could\nmake PPRs more effective.\nPPRs are usually scheduled 6 months after the market introduction, in order to\ninclude learning about how the product has been received by customers. However, in\npractice PPRs take place later because of difficulties to find a date for all participants.\nAt EngineeringCo, the process guidelines suggest 6 months after the project is\nfinished. This view was confirmed by Interviewee 6 (and others) at EngineeringCo:\n\u201cIt should not be directly after the product release, but later. The aim is after about 6\nmonths\u201d. However, checking the minutes of specific PPRs showed that four reviews\nat EngineeringCo took place an average of 10 months after product introduction.\nThree of the companies have PPRs that take between one and three hours and\none company invests a full day. At four of the case companies, PPRs are attended\nonly by the project team. In contrast at AppliancesCo the interest of senior\nmanagement has a big influence on the time and effort invested in PPRs. At this\ncompany, the Chief Technology Officer personally introduced the PPR process, and a\nfull day is invested, off-site and an internal company trainer is utilized as a moderator.\nThe results at the end of the PPR day are presented to the CTO and other senior\nmanagers.\nAlthough PPR guidelines existed in all case companies, generally, project\nmanagers prefer to prepare and organize the PPR in cooperation with their team\nmembers, or with the help of experienced colleagues. The objective of a typical PPR\nis an objective analysis of the project phases and outcome as well as a gathering of\nlessons learned.\nAcross all five cases it is interesting to note that it is mainly problems and\nnegative aspects of NPD that are discussed. \u201cMost of the time is focused on what was\ngood and what was bad. But it is usually very quickly into the direction what was bad\nbecause the good things you take for granted and\u2026 The focus is always on the\nnegative things.\u201d (Interviewee 5, EngineeringCo). A similar statement was given by\nInterviewee 1 from AppliancesCo: \u201cWe look more at the negative things, because\n18\npatting ourselves on the back does not really help us to improve. And you can\nimprove either by doing good things even better, but mainly by improving the\nproblem areas.\u201d The focus on discussing problems implies that PPRs mainly generate\nwarnings of how to avoid certain problems. Recommendations based on successful\npractices are seldom mentioned and so the potential to share best practice is being\nmissed.\nAll of the case companies produce minutes of specific PPRs and these\nincluded a list of at least three suggestions for improvement. However, the follow-up\non these points is often weak and the dissemination of the knowledge gained from\nPPRs is limited. Common across all cases was that most project managers use PPRs\nas an opportunity to give their personal positive feedback to the project team. For\nexample, managers of AppliancesCo and MachineryCo usually combine a PPR with\nan informal team dinner, whereas EngineeringCo and MedCareCo intend to introduce\nthis in the near future.\nOverall, Table 4 shows how our research provided comprehensive data on all\nof the characteristics of PPRs. Comparing the approaches of the different companies\nallowed a set of conclusions and recommendations to be made (right-hand column of\nTable 4), which will be discussed in a later section on implications for practitioners.\nExplicit and Tacit Knowledge\nAlthough the extant literature identifies the importance of PPRs, it does not\nspecifically mention that they can generate both explicit and tacit knowledge. To\ninvestigate the second research question, the different data sources were checked for\nthe use of metaphors and stories (as a proxy measure of tacit knowledge generation\nand exchange).\nAn example of the use of a metaphor was that used by the project manager at\nthe PPR observed at MachineryCo. He said: \u201cyou all know the many times I was\nbegging on my hands and knees and the only thing we got was another punch in the\nstomach instead of plasters for our wounds\u201d. Here he was referring to the shortage of\nresources during a critical phase of the project and that there was no support from top\nmanagement. However this only became clear to the observer after several minutes of\nthe resulting discussion, where participants exchanged views on what they had learnt\nfrom this experience. Another example stems from the PPR at EngineeringCo, where\na PPR participant used the phrase \u201cwe are always at the very end of the food chain\n19\nunfortunately\u201d meaning that he was responsible for the final assembly of products and\ntherefore vulnerable to suffering from all of the problems that were experienced\nduring earlier project phases. Various examples of metaphors and stories were\nobserved at AppliancesCo such as the use of the terms \u201cReichsbedenkentr\u00e4ger\u201d\n(German metaphor for someone who has strong doubts about everything \u2018Minister of\nDoubt\u2019), and\u201cMade im Speck\u201d (German metaphor for someone who lives in pure\nluxury), or an experience which turned out to be a worse experience than\n\u201cWurzelbehandlung\u201d (translation: having to endure root treatment at the dentist).\nFrom observing the PPRs it appeared that metaphors and stories acted as a catalyst for\nthe discussion. However, the metaphors and stories may only be understood by the\nproject team and would not be clear to anyone reading the minutes of the PPR (if the\nmetaphors and stories were actually documented\u2014something we will see is not the\ncase).\nAn interesting aspect of metaphors and stories that emerged from the\nobservations and analysis of the transcripts was the four ways in which they are\nlinked to the discussion. Metaphors and stories often seem to start the discussion of a\nparticular topic in an informal way, or act as a trigger for changing the subject. If\nmetaphors and stories are used in the middle of a discussion, it was often to\nstrengthen an argument, or to paraphrase an earlier argument, which might be easier\nfor all participants to understand. Metaphors and stories were also used at the end of\nspecific discussion points, as a form of summarizing the previous discussion. Finally,\nsome were used in a \u2018stand alone\u2019 fashion, perhaps indicating that the metaphor or\nstory was not powerful enough to stimulate discussion. Table 5 gives further\nexamples of the four categories their frequencies; it can be seen that the most frequent\nusage was at the end of a discussion. (It should be noted that this analysis is a new\napproach that emerged from the data, as opposed to being recommended in the\nliterature.)\nData source Metaphor and related discussion Place ofmetaphor\nTotal\nnumber\nof this\ntype\nPPR\nEngineeringCo.\n\u201cWe are on thin ice and still have\nquite a few problems.\u201d\nWhich consequences does all this\nhave overall to our customers?

But what\nwe did was with the colleagues from\nmarketing and development we have\ndeveloped indicators with which you\ncan see if something is a task or a\nproject.

As the current research is the\nfirst time that the frequency of usage of metaphors and stories has been documented\nfor PPRs, it is difficult to draw conclusions based on this frequency. No\n\u201cbenchmarks\u201d were found in any of the relevant literatures.\nOnce the frequency of usage of metaphors and stories had been identified for\nthe PPRs observed, the data from the repertory grid interviews and the minutes of\nPPRs were also coded and Table 6 shows the results. Interestingly, across the 19\ndocuments of PPRs inspected, only four metaphors and stories were documented.\nThis contrasts strongly with the use of 55 metaphors in the four PPRs observed. It\n21\nindicates that metaphors and stories are not generally documented by the project\nleaders who produce the minutes of PPRs. The repertory grid interviews are known to\nstimulate tacit knowledge and in the transcripts it was also found that metaphors and\nstories were used. The results indicate that much of the learning in PPRs is tacit in\nnature and is not documented in the minutes and as one interviewee said, \u201cDuring the\ndiscussion the real important points emerge within the team\u2014you will never find\nthese points in minutes or databases\u201d(Interviewee 7 - AppliancesCo).\nCase\nno\nCase name Metaphors\nand stories\nfound in\nminutes of\nPPRs\nMetaphors\nand stories\nused during\nrepertory\ngrids\nMetaphors\nand stories\nmentioned\nduring PPR\nobservations\nPPR\nLength\n1 Engineering Co. 5 14 2.5 hours\n2 Appliances Co. 2 12 30 7.5 hours\n3 MedCare Co. 5 6 2 hours\n4 Machinery Co. 1 3 5 3 hours\n5 Publishing Co. 1 10 n\/a n\/a\nTotal 4 35 55 15 hours\nTable 6: Number of metaphors and stories used during PPR discussions\nWithin the limitation of the exploratory current research, the results indicate\nthat metaphors and stories form an important part of PPR discussions and are used\n(consciously or subconsciously) to stimulate or summarize key points. They also\nappear to enable the transfer of knowledge on complex technological points by\nmaking the discussions understandable to those without detailed knowledge.\nDISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nAcross the case studies PPR practices were systematically probed and the type of\nlearning that results investigated. From the results it can be seen that many factors can\ninfluence the utility of PPRs. For example, if they are held too late there is a risk that\nkey learning points will have been forgotten. Similarly, the way in which the\ndiscussions are moderated will influence the generation and sharing of knowledge.\nAny knowledge that the NPD generates should ideally be widely shared within the\norganization but this appears not to be happening sufficiently at the case companies.\n22\nThe learning organization literature provides an understanding of how\ncomplex knowledge generation and exchange can be. Using metaphors and stories as\na proxy measure, this study shows that the learning in PPRs is broader than what is\ndocumented in reports. This indicates that there is a deficit in our understanding of\nhow NPD teams learn.\nThe current study\u2019s main limitations are linked to the sample of companies\ninvestigated, the way the cases were conducted, and the attempt to identify tacit\nknowledge generation and exchange. The five German companies studied cannot be\ntaken to be representative of either German industry or manufacturing companies as a\nwhole and so, here, wider survey research is needed. The case study protocol was\ndesigned to maximize internal validity through triangulation but it was still, to an\nextent, dependent on subjective interpretations of the researchers. With the experience\ngained from this study, construct validity could be improved still further. Tacit\nknowledge remains an elusive concept and our approach was simplistic and so this is\nan area where specific recommendations for further study can be made.\nRecommendations for Researchers\nThere is an urgent need for more research on knowledge creation in NPD\u2014it is\nsomewhat ironic that knowledge is probably nowhere more important than in R&D\nbut, in this context, it has hardly been investigated. The current study showed the\nneed for research in five main areas:\n1. A survey of PPR practices needs to be conducted using a representative sample of\ncompanies. It should identify both the frequency of usage of PPRs and their\ncharacteristics (using the 14 categories discussed in this article and a\nconsideration of the role of tacit knowledge). Such research would allow\ngeneralizations to be made on how PPRs are used;\n2. Systematic action research is needed to identify whether the recommendations\nfrom this study do lead to more effective PPRs and project-to-project learning.\n(Each of the five case companies received feedback and ideas from the\nresearchers on how to improve their PPR processes. This was very well received\nand anecdotal evidence indicates that PPRs have been improved.);\n3. The use of metaphors and stories has been recognized to be indicative of more\ninnovative organizations and effective leaders (Buckler and Zien, 1996).\n23\nHowever, their use in NPD teams has not been studied enough; ethnographic\nresearch could give powerful insights into how cross-functional NPD teams learn;\n4. One of the most important points for academics remains the question of how the\noccurrence of tacit learning can best be captured and analyzed. As recommended\nby the organizational learning literature, the use of metaphors and stories was\ntaken as a proxy measure for the creation and sharing of tacit knowledge. This led\nto the identification of different ways in which metaphors and stories are used in\nNPD discussions. However, more sophisticated approaches to understand tacit\nknowledge are needed;\n5. If PPRs are really effective, they will support project-to-project learning through\ndisseminating best practice and by preventing similar mistakes being made to\nthose in previous projects. Therefore, the way lessons learned are disseminated\nand help subsequent projects needs to be investigated. Such a complex topic\nwould probably best be attempted through the use of longitudinal case studies.\nRecommendations for Practitioners\nAn important question is: what can practitioners learn from this study of PPRs? In\nanswer, eight main recommendations can be made:\n1. The value of PPRs needs to be clearly communicated in R&D organisations. They\nshould not be viewed only as a (bureaucratic) requirement, but as an important\nlearning event for the NPD team and the wider organization (Table 4, point 1);\n2. The timing, location and duration of PPRs should be carefully chosen to\nmaximize learning. Management discipline is required to ensure that PPRs are\ngive a high enough priority (Table 4, points 2, 3 and 7);\n3. The core cross-functional NPD team and selected additional participants (e.g.\nsuppliers) are required to ensure broad discussions. Management attendance for\nthe presentation of the results is recommended to demonstrate the emphasis\nplaced on an effective PPR and to give recognition to the achievements of the\nNPD team (Table 4, point 4);\n4. A professional or skilled moderator can more effectively create the right\natmosphere and guide the discussions in a PPR than a project leader. \u201cTools\u201d such\nas cause-and-effect diagrams and \u201cpersonal satisfaction curves\u201d are likely to help\ngenerate and exchange more knowledge than simply discussing what went well\nand what could have been improved (Table 4, points 5, 6 and 10);\n24\n5. The preparation for a PPR should be conducted by the moderator and project\nmanager together and should build on the experience gained at previous PPRs\n(Table 4, points 8 and 9);\n6. The time and effort invested in PPRs can bring better returns if the knowledge is\ndisseminated to other project teams. Managers need to actively support this\nprocess, for example by active job rotation or the creation of project teams with\nexperienced as well as junior members of staff. The presentation of the results of\nPPRs to management and the leaders of other project teams are more effective\nmethods than reports and they stimulate social interactions, which CoPs theory\nindicates is so important for knowledge exchange (Table 4, points 11 and 12);\n7. PPRs should be used to identify where the experience from the completed project\nis relevant to current projects. This should lead to specific action points for\ncurrent projects, where clear responsibilities to transfer the learning need to be\ndefined. Through aiming to generate a number of specific action points, the\nproject-to-project learning can be made more tangible, which in turn will quickly\ndemonstrate the value of a PPR to both the participants and the members of other\nNPD project teams (Table 4, points 13 and 14);\n8. Management needs to encourage informal interaction between NPD teams and the\nuse of the metaphors and stories to disseminate learning. Currently metaphors are\nnot documented or disseminated and so project-to-project learning opportunities\nare being lost. The moderator of the PPR could focus on metaphors and story\ntelling as a way of improving dissemination (this point arose not from Table 4 but\nfrom the investigation of the second research question).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis article presented an in-depth study of post-project reviews at five manufacturing\ncompanies. Building on the ideas in the literature, data were collected from company\ndocuments, in interviews, and through observing PPR discussions. The contribution\nof the research is:\n\uf0b7 It consolidated the findings on PPRs in the extant literature;\n\uf0b7 It used multiple sources of data to ensure that a valid understanding of PPRs was\ndeveloped;\n25\n\uf0b7 It probed the role of tacit knowledge in NPD learning, which has not been done\nbefore;\n\uf0b7 It generated a set of recommendations for practitioners and researchers.\nOverall, the authors hope this article will stimulate other researchers to focus on PPRs\nbecause project-to-project learning in NPD is crucial and researchers need to know\nmore about how to stimulate and disseminate knowledge.\nNOTES\n1The German traffic ministry allocates penalty points for driving offences from an\noffice in Flensburg.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers and the editor for their\nchallenging, insightful and encouraging comments on the first draft of this paper.\nREFERENCES\nAbel-Hamid, T.
