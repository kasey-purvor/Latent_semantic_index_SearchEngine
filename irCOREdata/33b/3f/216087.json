Halliday shaped the field, particularly in \nthe UK, through powerful insights, inspiring pedagogy and a passionate commitment to his \nsubject. His work was conspicuous both for its judicious assessment of complex subjects and \nits capacity to intertwine analytical, empirical and normative registers. He was a rousing \nspeaker and a captivating writer \u2013 clear, lucid and free of bunkum. For all the range of his \nwork over the four decades in which he published, Halliday remained consistent to a kind of \n\u2018empathetic internationalism\u2019, one rooted in a \u2018radical Enlightenment\u2019 commitment to critical \nreason, rights and secularism. Halliday offered unwavering support, sometimes academically, \nat other times more directly, to those fighting oppression around the world. And he never lost \nsight of the need to stay resolutely independent of intellectual fads. Fred Halliday was more \nthan an individual; his death represents the passing of an era.1  \nIn what follows, we look back \u2013 in order to look forward \u2013 at the most important \ndimensions of Halliday\u2019s scholarship for an IR audience. The first section traces Halliday\u2019s \ncommitment to \u2018empathetic internationalism\u2019 through his engagement with four thinkers: \nIsaac Deutscher, Bill Warren, Maxime Rodinson and Ernest Gellner. As we argue, Halliday\u2019s \ninternationalism was keenly felt, yet took ambivalent form: at times it focused on resistance \n(via dissent, collective action and revolutionary struggle) to the coercive, exploitative \ndimensions of capitalist modernity; at other times it supported the spread of progressive ideas \nand practices (rights, legal equality, democracy) carried via capitalism and its capillaries. As \nsuch, this assessment of Halliday\u2019s understanding of internationalism allows us to unpack \nsome \u2018creative tensions\u2019 which underlie his scholarship. The second section looks more \n                                                 \n* Our thanks to a number of people who provided comments on this piece: Margot Light, Toby \nDodge, Luca Tardelli, Kirsten Ainley, Paul Kirby, Mick Cox, Chris Hill and the editors of \nMillennium.  \n1 An appreciation of the range and depth of Halliday\u2019s influence can be gauged by the level of \ncomment which his death prompted. Of the many obituaries about him, those in The Times (by Toby \nDodge and George Lawson), The Guardian (by Sami Zubaida) and The Economist (anonymously \nauthored) are good places to start. A wide ranging set of tributes can be found at the opendemocracy \nwebsite: http:\/\/www.opendemocracy.net\/anthony-barnett\/fred-halliday-1946-%E2%80%93-2010. \n \n2 \ndirectly at Halliday\u2019s impact on IR, concentrating on his interventions in IR theory, gender \nstudies and revolutions. The exuberance, not to mention the sheer volume, of Halliday\u2019s \noeuvre (twenty-seven contributions to Millennium alone), precludes easy analysis. As such, \nour appraisal of his work is necessarily provisional, concentrating as much on the ways \nHalliday served to open up terrain for others as on his direct impact. Throughout the article, \nwe make no pretence to capture fully, let alone provide any final reckoning of, this most \ninsatiable of careers. Rather, our aim is more modest \u2013 to examine critically some of the core \nstrands of Halliday\u2019s work in order to provoke comment from those who studied under him, \nread him or heard him speak, and those who will engage further in years to come. To that \nend, we close by suggesting a number of openings which Halliday\u2019s work prompts for \ncontemporary IR audiences. \n \nInternationalisms: Deutscher, Warren, Rodinson, Gellner \nFred Halliday was born in Dublin in 1946. Like many self-exiled Irish intellectuals before \nhim, Halliday enjoyed an ambivalent relationship with the British establishment. Educated at \na prestigious Benedictine boarding school in Yorkshire (Ampleforth College), Oxford (where \nhe achieved a First in PPE), SOAS (where he did an MSc in 1968-9) and LSE (where \nHalliday did a PhD, albeit one which lasted nearly two decades), Halliday\u2019s educational \nbackground was one of relative privilege. But this tells only part of the story. Growing up as \nthe third son of a Quaker-Methodist father and a Catholic mother in one of the more \ndangerous parts of Ireland (Dundalk) during one its more turbulent periods (he vividly \nremembered the onset of the IRA Border Campaign in 1956), Halliday knew what it was like \nto challenge received wisdoms and cross restricted divides. The only witnesses to his parent\u2019s \n\u2018mixed marriage\u2019 were, so the story went, some local gravediggers. Thus Halliday was \nequally at home in the radical hotbed of 1960s SOAS and on the editorial board of New Left \nReview (NLR) (where he served from 1969-83) as when studying \u2013 or teaching \u2013 at the heart \nof the British educational establishment.  \nAfter an early career spent mainly outside the academy (principally at the NLR, but \nalso including spells at the Transnational Institute in Amsterdam and the Institute for Policy \nStudies in Washington), Halliday was appointed to the LSE in 1983, first as a Temporary \nLecturer in International Relations and, in 1985, as a full Professor. By the time he was \nelected Fellow of the British Academy in 2002, Halliday was a major figure in British public \nlife. He became Montague Burton Professor of International Relations in 2005 before, in his \nfinal years, taking up a post as ICREA Research Professor at the Institut Barcelona d\u2019Estudis \n \n3 \nInternacionals (IBEI). Unlike many contemporary academics, Halliday reached a substantial \npublic audience via his many talks and media work \u2013 he was as comfortable debating on al-\nJazeera as he was in seminar rooms and lecture halls. His frequent columns for \nopendemocracy, as well as his regular contributions to the Middle East Research and \nInformation Project (MERIP) and commentaries in the mainstream press, ensured that his \nwork reached a wide audience.2 Indeed, Halliday was a voracious writer throughout his adult \nlife, writing over twenty books and producing hundreds of journal and media articles. His \nfirst publication, a contribution to an edited volume on student activism at the height of the \n1968 uprisings, was written when he was twenty-two.3 As a result, by the time of his \nappointment at LSE, Halliday was already well known as a prominent public intellectual of \nthe Left.4 This did not endear him much to the more conservative members of the LSE \nhierarchy. Initially the outsider amongst a group of five senior academics interviewed for the \npost, Halliday won over the committee with his breadth of knowledge, range of languages \nand overriding ebullience.5 They voted unanimously to appoint him. This did not, however, \nhalt noisy discontent from certain members of the LSE faculty, one of whom denounced \nHalliday as a \u2018Trotskyist PLO sympathiser\u2019, an epithet that Halliday may not have taken \nentirely as an insult.6  \n                                                 \n2 Halliday\u2019s columns for opendemocracy are collected in: The World in the 2000s: Political Journeys, \ned. David Hayes (London: Saqi, Forthcoming). Halliday\u2019s catholic tendencies when it came to finding \noutlets for his work did not always find favour amongst his colleagues. Indeed, he was admonished by \nPerry Anderson, his colleague at New Left Review, for \u2018taking the smuggler\u2019s road to socialism\u2019 \u2013 the \ncharge was writing for The Guardian. Halliday\u2019s retort, as chronicled in his resignation letter from the \nNLR, was characteristically blunt, \u2018the NLR takes itself far too seriously \u2026 there is an element in our \ndiscussions and in our themes of a self-appointed general staff without any troops at our command\u2019. \n3 Fred Halliday, \u2018Students of the World Unite\u2019 in Student Power eds. Alexander Cockburn and Robin \nBlackburn (London: Penguin, 1969), 287-326.  \n4 Key publications before Halliday\u2019s appointment at LSE included an edited volume on the work of \nIsaac Deutscher: Russia, China and the West (Oxford: OUP, 1970); two books on the Middle East: \nArabia Without Sultans (London: Penguin, 1974); and Iran: Dictatorship and Development (London: \nPenguin, 1978); a co-authored book (with Maxine Molyneux) on Third World revolutions: The \nEthiopian Revolution (London: Verso, 1982); and a study of the increasing hostilities between the \nSoviet Union and the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s: The Making of the Second \nCold War (London: Verso, 1983).   \n5 As chronicled by the reflections of Meghnad Desai and Lawrence Freedman, both of whom served \non Halliday\u2019s appointment committee. Their support was well rewarded. Halliday came, over time, to \nplay a major intellectual and institutional role in the school. And he also loved the place: \u2018LSE is \nunique in the cosmopolitanism and intelligence of its student body, the quality of its intellectual \nengagement, and the free atmosphere of its teaching and research\u2019. Fred Halliday, \u2018IR in a Post-\nHegemonic Age\u2019, LSE Public Lecture, 20 January 2008. \n6 Next to the general level of disquiet at Halliday\u2019s appointment, Hedley Bull\u2019s reference to Halliday \nas a \u2018communist ratbag\u2019, made after they appeared together on a BBC radio show in the early 1980s, \nseems fairly mild.  \n \n4 \nIn his inaugural lecture at LSE, Halliday set out with characteristic clarity what he \nunderstood to be the two core elements of IR as a discipline: \u2018One is the question of how and \nwith what concepts to analyse relations between states and across frontiers \u2026 the second is \nthe question of value, of the normative\u2019.7 To explain and evaluate international affairs, \ndiagnose and prescribe change in global politics, to combine moral contestation with rigorous \nanalysis (\u2018protest with perception\u2019) was, for Halliday, the foremost task of academic enquiry. \n\u2018Tension\u2019 and \u2018contradiction\u2019 were, for Halliday, recurrent themes in this regard, not just in \nthe actual history of modern international relations, but crucially, also germane in thinking \nabout how to understand, analyse and transform world politics. \u2018Internationalism\u2019 was, \naccording to Halliday, pivotal in that it simultaneously captured these tensions and bridged \nthe divide between the analytical and the normative, in other words between aspirations to \nchange and the realities of power. Internationalism offered a means of both recognising the \n\u2018contradictory unity\u2019 of \u2018the international\u2019 and marrying analytical clarity with political \ncommitment. Indeed, \u2018empathetic internationalism\u2019 acted as a consistent compass for locating \nHalliday\u2019s work. \n Much of Halliday\u2019s internationalism was nurtured through his life-long travels. From \nthe initial teenage trip to Iran to his final years in Barcelona, Halliday remained an incessant \nglobetrotter. This was, however, no mere cosmopolitanism of the frequent flyer lounge, but \nan expression of a rooted internationalism, driven by the desire to learn about the world and, \nindeed, live international relations in situ: be it marching with Dhofari guerrillas in the late \n1960s or taking an impromptu visit to the demilitarised zone separating Kuwait and Iraq in \n1991. Indeed, for the better part of the 1970s, Halliday acted as a roving correspondent for \nthe New Left Review, dispatching informed, vivid and engaged reports on political crises in \nsouthern Arabia, Eritrea, the Caribbean, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. Halliday also contributed \na number of book-length studies issued from his journeys in an insurgent Third World.8  \nAll this formed the biographical backdrop to Halliday\u2019s later, more self-consciously \nacademic work on revolutions, internationalism, the Cold War and the Middle East. In one of \nhis valedictory \u2013 or, as he labelled them, \u2018transitional\u2019 \u2013 lectures, Halliday insisted that, \u2018I \nwould value much more highly a job candidate, or aspirant to promotion, who could read and \nspeak a foreign language, had lived and researched in other countries and cultures, who had \nsat in a village in Yemen or a favela in Brazil, or worked for a year or two in Moscow or \n                                                 \n7 Fred Halliday, \u2018Three Concepts of Internationalism\u2019, International Affairs 88, no. 2 (1988): 187. \n8 Most notably: Halliday, Arabia Without Sultans; Halliday, Iran: Dictatorship and Development; \nHalliday and Molyneux, The Ethiopian Revolution. \n \n5 \nRome, than someone who had been cited in a supposedly top ranking meta-theoretical \ndisciplinary journal.\u20199 These experiences also informed Halliday\u2019s political commitments \nwhich were, for all their tensions and contradictions, underpinned by a deep personal loyalty \nto those peoples and individuals with whom he had shared comradeship and hospitality.  \nYet it is perhaps by discussing some of Halliday\u2019s principal intellectual influences \nthat we can best grasp the core elements of his \u2018empathetic internationalism\u2019. Four \nindividuals \u2013 Isaac Deutscher, Bill Warren, Maxime Rodinson and Ernest Gellner \u2013 loom \nlarge across Halliday\u2019s oeuvre.10 All four were, in their own way, descendants of the radical \nEuropean Enlightenment, staunch internationalists, \u2018area specialists\u2019 of some renown and, in \nthe case of the first three, militantly independent Marxists. At the risk of some stylised \ncontrivance, we can associate each of these thinkers with an aspect of Halliday\u2019s \ninternationalism: from Deutscher, an emphasis on the ways in which distinct forms of \ndomestic order led, in turn, to systemic international competition; from Warren, an \nunderstanding of capitalism as the potentially progressive carrier of European Enlightenment; \nfrom Rodinson, a materialist critique of culture, identity and claims to regional \nexceptionalism; and from Gellner, a commitment to rights, equality and \u2018radical \nuniversalism\u2019 \u2013 what Halliday was to call \u2018complex solidarity\u2019. \n \nIsaac Deutscher \nAlthough Halliday came of political age in the years surrounding 1968, contributing to the \nwave of radical activism which characterised the period through his work on the ultra-leftist \nnewspaper Black Dwarf, it was his association with the \u2018second\u2019 New Left Review, under the \neditorial triumvirate of Perry Anderson, Robin Blackburn and Tariq Ali, which introduced \nhim to the work of Isaac Deutscher. Deutscher was an exiled Polish Marxist, famous among \n                                                 \n9 Fred Halliday, \u2018Social Science and the Middle East: Myths, Pitfalls and Opportunities\u2019, LSE Public \nLecture, 7 January 2008. One of Halliday\u2019s b\u00eate-noirs was the fictional, if disturbingly plausible, \npublication: \u2018The Mid-Atlantic Journal of Inverted Abstraction\u2019. \n10 In keeping with the man himself, Halliday\u2019s influences were a diverse, cosmopolitan bunch. Apart \nfrom those detailed in this section, they included the British polymath E.H. Carr, the Hungarian \neconomic historian Karl Polanyi, the French sociologist Raymond Aron, the German anti-fascist \nWilly Brandt and the man Halliday described as \u2018my greatest intellectual hero\u2019 \u2013 the Irish politician \nand academic Conor Cruise O\u2019Brien. It is tempting to see Halliday\u2019s influences as, to some extent at \nleast, offering a mirror to his own character. Hence his description of Cruise O\u2019Brien could just as \neasily be applied to Halliday himself: \u2018restless, cantankerous, independent, polyglot, always \ncourageous, or as we quaintly put it \u201coutspoken\u201d, often brilliantly perceptive, at times plain wrong, he \nembodied Schiller\u2019s motto to be at once a citizen of his country and a citizen of his age\u2019. Fred \nHalliday, \u2018Legacies of Cold War\u2019, Government and Opposition Lecture, Political Studies Association \nAnnual Conference, 9 April 2009. \n \n6 \nother things for his biographies of Trotsky and Stalin.11 Deutscher was adopted by many in \nthe Anglophone New Left as a living link between the interwar Bolshevik generation and the \nstudent activists of the period, bringing a strong dose of strategic realism from the former to \nthe revolutionary idealism of the latter. But it was Deutscher\u2019s understanding of the Soviet \nbloc as a flawed, yet substantial, challenger to the capitalist West that informed Halliday\u2019s \nunderstanding of the Cold War. The \u2018great contest\u2019, Deutscher argued, was an inter-systemic \nrivalry between two irreconcilable socio-economic systems (communism and capitalism), not \nmerely the product of ideological \u2018perception\u2019 and \u2018misperception\u2019 or the latest round of \ninevitable Great Power clashes.12 Rather, the Cold War was the geopolitical expression of \nrival means of organising polities, economics and societies \u2013 the internationalisation of \nEuropean civil wars after World War II. Deutscher saw the USSR as the geopolitical inheritor \nof the Bolshevik revolution and insisted that socio-political and ideological transformations \nwithin that state were having a significant impact on international affairs more broadly. \nHalliday adopted three of Deutscher\u2019s propositions when developing his own \ninterpretation of the Cold War: that the USSR was a revolutionary state when it came to \ninternational relations; that radical change within states significantly shaped their external \nrelations; and that the Cold War was an inter-systemic rather than inter-state conflict, pitting \ninto battle two rival visions of modernity. Deutscher\u2019s impact is perhaps most pronounced in \nHalliday\u2019s Making of the Second Cold War, in which the intensification of US-Soviet \nantagonism during the late 1970s and early 1980s are explained with reference to a fresh \nwave of Third World revolutions and counter-revolutions, and the accompanying emergence \nof the New Right in the West. This ran contrary to the prevailing views of both the western \nLeft and the international peace movement, who tended to identify the Cold War as an \n\u2018imaginary war\u2019 defined by the convergence of militarised bureaucracies and oligarchic \npower-elites within both blocs. Where thinkers such as E.P. Thompson and C. Wright Mills \nsaw the homologous nature of each side\u2019s \u2018military-industrial complex\u2019 as tending towards \n\u2018exterminism\u2019, for Halliday, the Cold War did not endure, nor was it dangerous, because of \ninternal bureaucratic logics shared by both capitals.13 Rather, the Cold War was a conflict \n                                                 \n11 On this, see Deutscher\u2019s: The Prophet Armed (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1954); The \nProphet Unarmed (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1959); The Prophet Outcast (Oxford: Oxford \nUniversity Press, 1963); and Stalin: A Political Biography (London: Pelican, 1970). \n12 Isaac Deutscher, The Great Contest (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1960). \n13 This debate is best captured in: E.P. Thompson ed., Exterminism and the Cold War (London: Verso, \n1982). Also see: C. Wright Mills, The Causes of World War Three (New York: Simon and Schuster, \n1958); Mary Kaldor, The Disintegrating West (London: Allen Lane, 1978); and Mary Kaldor, The \nImaginary War (London: Basil Blackwell, 1990). \n \n7 \nrooted in radically different socio-economic systems and value orientations. As such, it could \nnot end through arms races, Third World Revolutions or peace movements, but only through \nthe decisive victory of one side over the other. Crucially, for Halliday, this was not a victory \nwhich the Soviet Union could win \u2013 from the late 1970s on, Halliday charted the unequal \nnature of the great contest, monitoring US superiority across a range of military, political and \neconomic indicators.14  \n \nBill Warren \nHalliday\u2019s \u2018externalist\u2019 approach to the Cold War was part of a broader theoretical orientation \nwhich saw the modern international system as containing two core dynamics: on the one \nhand, a universalising tendency towards cooperation and interdependence; and on the other, \nsharp geopolitical fragmentation and deep socio-economic inequality. The Cold War was, for \nHalliday, a prime example of this \u2018contradictory unity\u2019, cutting across both \u2018horizontal\u2019 inter-\nstate relations and \u2018vertical\u2019 socio-economic antagonisms. These two dynamics \u2013 \ncontradictions inherent to the system \u2013 were, for Halliday, made starker by the uneven spread \nof capitalist modernity. That capitalism was, for Halliday, the primary force underlying \nmodern international relations seems hardly controversial, at least not outside the \nconservative world of mainstream IR. But it does beg some knotty questions about exactly \nhow capitalism shaped international processes. Here, Halliday was less sanguine. Earlier \nstudies, such as his Arabia Without Sultans, set the tone for much of his work via a lapidary \nendorsement of what he called \u2018the law\u2019 of uneven and combined development:  \n \n[c]apitalism unifies the world into a single market and into a system of political \ndominations; yet the different sub-sections of this world system remain distinct. In \nmany cases, the differences between them are accentuated by incorporation into a \nsingle system. It is because of this unevenness that the weakest links in the \ncapitalist system as a whole may be found not in the most developed countries but \nin those countries where the retarded impact of capitalism creates contradictions \nthat are all the sharper because these developments carried through elsewhere have \nnot yet been completed.15 \n \n                                                 \n14 If the ultimate failure of the Soviet experiment was not in question, the timing of its collapse was \nless certain. In that sense, Halliday was surprised, if sympathetic, to attempts at saving the system \ninitiated by the new generation of Soviet leaders who came to power in the mid-1980s, chief amongst \nthem Mikhail Gorbachev. Indeed, he offered a platform at LSE to a number of Gorbachev\u2019s \nreformers, including Abel Aganbegyan and Tatyana Zaslavskaya. For a broader assessment of the \npost-Soviet legacy, see: Fred Halliday, \u2018Third World Socialism: 1989 and After\u2019 in The Global 1989, \neds. George Lawson, Chris Armbruster and Michael Cox (Cambridge: CUP, 2010).  \n15 Halliday, Arabia Without Sultans, 17. \n \n8 \nYet such emphases on the contradictions and inequalities fostered by the uneven \nspread of capitalism, with all the prospects for violent conflict that its \u2018retarded impact\u2019 \ngenerated, sat uneasily with Halliday\u2019s defence of the, at least partially, progressive nature of \nthis spread. In this regard, Halliday was much influenced by the work of Bill Warren, who \ntaught him at SOAS and who had undertaken a systematic critique of \u2018dependency\u2019 theory, \nthe theoretical toolkit of choice for those on the Left during the 1960s and 1970s.16 Warren \nargued that, misguided by Lenin\u2019s pamphlet on imperialism and hoodwinked by Third World \nnationalism, leftist denunciations of \u2018underdevelopment\u2019 contradicted both the record of \nprogressive socio-economic change introduced by capitalism and Marx\u2019s own cautious \ncelebration of this process, even when this took colonial form. Against the claims made by \ndependency theorists, Warren saw Third World development as possible under conditions of \ncapitalism. And Halliday\u2019s own work echoed these sentiments. Indeed, running alongside \nHalliday\u2019s emphasis on uneven and combined development is an unmistakably Warrenite \nstress on the cosmopolitan thrust of capitalism as first developed in industrialising Europe \nand then exported to, and replicated by, Third World societies. Halliday saw a number of \nprogressive elements in this process, not least the development of polities, economies and \nsocial orders built around principles of rights, equality and the rule of law. At one time, he \nargued, capitalism had been considered incapable of supporting universal suffrage, the legal \nequality of men and women, decolonisation and Third World industrialisation. Yet all of \nthese processes had come to pass within, and were possibly even enabled by, an era defined \nby capitalist expansion.  \nThis notion of capitalism is difficult to square with Halliday\u2019s endorsement of uneven \nand combined development. Indeed, Halliday appears to see the internationalising dimension \nof capitalism in two contrasting ways: in the first place, as linear and progressive, the \npurveyor of a \u2018radical universalism\u2019 which carries with it \u2018gifts\u2019 of suffrage, rights, legal \nequality and democracy; and in the second place, as necessarily uneven, the purveyor of \ncontradictions which contained within them the seeds of violent conflict. As such, although \nHalliday consistently saw capitalism as the prime mover behind modern internationalism, he \nwas less clear about how this relationship was consummated. And there is little doubt that, \nalthough Halliday remained an unwavering critic of capitalism\u2019s \u2018dark side\u2019, over the course \nof his career he became more accepting of the capacity of capitalism to adapt itself around a \n                                                 \n16 Bill Warren, Imperialism: Pioneer of Capitalism, ed.

As he put it in a 2006 interview, \u2018I feel much happier with a copy of the \nUNDP Human Development Report than with the New Left Review\u2019.17  \nHalliday\u2019s path from \u2018revolutionary socialist\u2019 to \u2018critical liberal\u2019 had several \ncomponents: first, his broad acceptance of the Warrenite position that capitalism played a \nleading role in spreading progressive ideas and practices around the world; second, his \nassessment of the failures of alternatives to capitalist modernity, whether seen in the crucible \n\u2013 and disappointment \u2013 of Third World revolutions or in the remnants of \u2018actually existing \nsocialism\u2019; third, an inability to support reflex anti-Americanism when he considered the \nrecord of that country to be finely balanced between progressive currents such as the civil \nrights and women\u2019s movements and its disastrous overseas interventions and family planning \npolicies; and finally, his impatience with the leftist tendency to valorize (or at least abide) \nreactionary regimes and movements, such as Ba\u2019athism or political Islam, in the name of \nanti-imperialism \u2013 as Halliday was fond of saying, \u2018the future of humanity does not lie in the \nback streets of Faluja\u2019.18 Intriguingly, Halliday claimed that it was not his principles which \nhad changed, but fellow travellers on the Left who had failed to learn from the events of the \nperiod and who had consistently taken knee-jerk ideological positions out of keeping with a \nbroader critical sensibility. Although it is fair to say that Halliday\u2019s work remained \ncommitted to principles of solidarity, universalism and independent judgement, his shift from \nopen advocate of revolutionary socialism to a more disassociated sense of critique was one \nthat many of his former comrades found difficult to accept.  \n \nMaxime Rodinson \nHalliday\u2019s recognition of capitalism as the concrete manifestation of internationalism in the \nmodern era had its corollary in what we might call his methodological internationalism. Here \nthe figure of the French intellectual Maxime Rodinson is, perhaps, the most significant \ninterlocutor. Rodinson\u2019s \u2018materialist Orientalism\u2019 profoundly influenced Halliday\u2019s analysis \nof the Third World, most specifically the Greater Middle East. Rodinson himself had an \nambiguous relationship to his specialist region. On the one hand, he unapologetically \nidentified himself as a professional Orientalist and acknowledged the \u2018scientific\u2019 \ncontributions of many of his fellow philologists, Islamologists and anthropologists, both past \nand present. On the other hand, Rodinson rejected \u2018the Orientalist\u2019s self-satisfied acceptance \n                                                 \n17 Danny Postel, \u2018Who is Responsible?: An Interview with Fred Halliday\u2019, Salmagundi 150\/151 \n(2006): www.opendemocracy.net\/danny-postel\/who-is-responsible-interview-with-fred-halliday.    \n18 Fred Halliday, \u2018The Jihadism of Fools\u2019, Dissent, Winter (2007): 144-7.  \n \n10 \nof their \u201cacademic ghetto\u201d\u2019 and advocated the application of \u2018sociology, demography, \npolitical economy, linguistics, anthropology, ethnology or the different branches of general \nhistory \u2026 to study peoples and regions in a given historical period and still take into account \nthe specificities of those peoples or regions at a particular moment in time.\u201919  \nThis historical-sociological method \u2013 an approach which examines the ways in which \nrelatively stable practices (social structures) emerge and develop through time and across \nspace \u2013 is the leitmotif of Rodinson\u2019s work. It is a mode of inquiry which takes as its starting \npoint the ways in which common social, economic and political experiences find expression \nwithin particular contexts. In Rodinson\u2019s pithy formulation, \u2018The Muslim world is specific, \nbut it is not exceptional.\u201920 Thus, for Rodinson, the universal dimensions of the Prophet \nMuhammad\u2019s message are inextricably linked to the specific features of Meccan society at \nthe turn of the seventh century CE and its location within the wider geopolitics and political \neconomy of Arabia and its neighbours. Similarly, the material force of Islam in the Middle \nEast was, for Rodinson, relative to other sources of political, military and socio-economic \npower. As such, the Muslim faith should not be understood as an unchanging monolith but as \na dynamic panoply of experiences within a common core of beliefs and practices.  \nIt is no exaggeration to say that this \u2018materialist internationalism\u2019 is axiomatic to \nHalliday\u2019s work, particularly his writing on the Middle East.21 It was materialist in its \nemphasis on the concrete sources of religious, national or ethnic identities; it was \ninternationalist in that it saw such specificity as comparable to, indeed often the product of, \nimitation and amalgamation with outside influences. For Halliday, there was no such thing as \nIslamic banking or Asian values \u2013 the former was \u2018capitalist banking with a different cover\u2019, \nwhile the latter was, at best, a distorting fiction: \u2018there are no Asian values, only values in \nAsia\u2019.22 For Halliday, all economies were concerned with the same things \u2013 the supply of \nmoney and the balance between profit and redistribution, just as all polities sought to manage \nthe same tensions over legitimate authority and state power. The history of the Middle East, \nlike the rest of the world, was one of resource extraction, state formation, class conflict and \ncultural fusion.23 As Halliday was to define his \u2018tribe\u2019 of Enlightenment rationality:  \n                                                 \n19 Maxime Rodinson, Europe and the Mystique of Islam (London: I.B. Tauris, 1987): 117. \n20 Maxime Rodinson, Islam and Capitalism (London: Allen Lane, 1974): 227 \n21 See, for example: Fred Halliday, \u2018The Politics of the Umma\u2019, Mediterranean Politics 7, no. 3 \n(2002): 20-41; Fred Halliday, The Middle East in International Relations (Cambridge: CUP, 2005). \n22 Fred Halliday, \u2018Obiter Dicta and Other Reflections\u2019, Unpublished Paper, 20. Halliday\u2019s view of \n\u2018Asian values\u2019 was influenced by the work of his LSE colleague, Michael Leifer. Indeed, it may be \nthat this line is originally Leifer\u2019s rather than Halliday\u2019s. \n23 Halliday, \u2018The Middle East and Social Science\u2019. \n \n11 \n \nThis is an approach with an inbuilt presumption against treating any region or culture \nor people as particular or unique. As far as area studies in general, and the Middle \nEast in particular, is concerned, I therefore start from a set of universal principles, \nanalytic and normative, that would ask to what extent these can help elucidate the \nparticular societies in question.24  \n \nSimilarly, when it came to understanding \u2018Anti-Muslimism in contemporary politics\u2019, \nHalliday sought to shift analysis away from the essentialising discourse of \u2018Islamophobia\u2019 to \nan explanation of anti-Muslim bigotry within specific socio-historical circumstances, for \nexample those \u2018of ethnicity, intra-communal conflict, administrative corruption and inter-\nstate conflict.\u201925 In short, \u2018Islam as an object of study must be dissolved in order to be made \nconcrete in the study of particular events, times and places\u2019.26 \n In line with the tradition of critical scholarship in which Rodinson and Halliday can \nbe located, such injunctions were deployed not just in analysis of these societies, but also in \nsolidarity with them. Both Rodinson and Halliday championed internationalism as the \nconcrete expression of their scholarly critique of nationalism. And both directed much of \ntheir intellectual energies towards the emancipation of Middle Eastern peoples. Indeed, \nRodinson\u2019s critique of essentialist understandings of nationalism and religion delivered one \nof the earliest denunciations of political Zionism and Israeli expansionism. His (and \nDeutscher\u2019s) stance on these issues, including support for a two-state solution to the Arab-\nIsraeli dispute, was wholeheartedly endorsed by Halliday:  \n \nIts essence was an exemplary \u2018internationalism\u2019 that recognised the rights of the \ntwo national groups, denounced the chauvinism and militarism of both sides, and \n(most important) rebutted in sharp, secular terms the religious rhetoric emanating \nfrom all quarters. Rodinson and Deutscher strongly criticised both the political \nculture and the authoritarian politics of the Arab world (something the \u2018solidarity\u2019 \nmovements of today seem unable to do) and the rabbinical, militaristic culture of \nIsrael. Their committed, secular stance is far removed from the totemic icons of \n\u2018identity\u2019, \u2018community\u2019, \u2018tradition\u2019, and \u2018feeling\u2019 that came to flourish in \ndiscussion of the region. It remains of utmost relevance.27 \n \n                                                 \n24 Fred Halliday, Islam and the Myth of Confrontation (London: I.B. Tauris, 1996): 196.

For Halliday, as in other parts of the world, the peoples of the Middle East \nhad, within given socio-historical constraints, mobilised, resisted and made choices about \ntheir political fate. Some of these had been misguided and counterproductive. Recognising \nthis, and saying so without Eurocentric guilt or sectarianism complex, was for Halliday an \nelementary component of a \u2018complex solidarity\u2019 which underpinned his notion of \ninternationalism. As Halliday saw it, culture was always embedded within wider networks of \npower. As such, no culture, whatever its pretence to eternal blessing, was free from critique, \njust as no peoples, under conditions of oppression, were beyond solidarity. Nationalism, for \nHalliday, was little more than an invented excuse for chauvinism. In contrast, \ninternationalism served as a progressive current in world affairs. \n \nErnest Gellner \nIt is in this context that the fourth component of Halliday\u2019s internationalism emerges, one \nlinked to a programme of \u2018radical universalism\u2019: \u2018[a] perspective on international relations \nthat is both realistic and critical, one that advocates change on the basis of what can plausibly \nbe said to be possible and which denies durability and legitimacy to that which exists at the \nmoment [\u2026] it is possible to suggest three principles that can guide such a perspective: \nequality, democracy and rights\u2019.28 Most of Halliday\u2019s work on internationalism already \nimplied such a programme. But it is fair to say that, as the contours of the post-Cold War \nworld became better defined, two dimensions of this perspective, both drawn from Halliday\u2019s \nclose appreciation of the work of Ernest Gellner, became especially pronounced.  \n The first was an uncompromising defence of what, in the face of religious extremism \nand post-modern perspectivism, Gellner called \u2018rationalist fundamentalism\u2019.29  \n \nRationalist fundamentalism, whilst absolutizing no substantive conviction \u2013 no \naffirmation that this or that absolutely must be thus \u2013 does absolutize some formal, \none might say, procedural principles of knowledge \u2026 It is a vision that desacralizes, \ndisestablishes, disenchants everything substantive: no privileged facts, occasion, \nindividuals, institutions or associations \u2026 All hypotheses are subject to scrutiny, all \nfacts open to novel interpretations, and all facts subject to symmetrical laws which \npreclude the miraculous, the sacred occasion, the intrusion of the Other into the \nMundane\u2019.30  \n \n                                                 \n28 Fred Halliday, The World at 2000 (London: Macmillan, 2002): 144. \n29 Ernest Gellner, Postmodernism, Reason and Religion (London: Routledge, 1992). Italics in original. \n30 Ibid., 80-1. \n \n13 \nLike Gellner, Halliday applied \u2018rationalist fundamentalism\u2019 consistently in his work, \nin the process rejecting variants of analytical and normative communitarianism, \nperspectivism or exceptionalism. Considering that much of his political and academic life \nhad, until then, been dedicated to puncturing invocations of \u2018culture\u2019, \u2018identity\u2019 and \n\u2018difference\u2019 by international agents \u2013 both hegemonic and subaltern \u2013 Halliday was especially \nexercised by the perils of a world in which Huntingtonian \u2018fault-line babble\u2019 found \ncommunion with various nationalist, regionalist or religious advocates of \u2018cultural \nauthenticity\u2019.31 The appropriate response to such a challenge was, for Halliday, to develop \nand approach an IR enterprise which: \u2018First \u2026 is empirical, conceptual and, where relevant, \ncritical; Second \u2026 meets the criterion that is central to the social sciences, namely \nexplanation; Third \u2026 locates issues and concepts in their appropriate historical context.\u2019 32 \nAccompanying these commitments was a second, more concrete expression of \n\u2018radical universalism\u2019, namely rights. While the demise of the Soviet bloc marked the end of \nthe communist alternative to world order, the political legacy of the Age of Atlantic \nrevolutions was still alive after the Cold War. In fact, its aspirations remained a powerful \nsource of mobilisation: \u2018a world in which the differences of wealth within and between \npeoples had been radically reduced, in which education and growth in prosperity and science \nwas broadly equally available to all would be fundamentally different to today\u2019.33 Halliday\u2019s \nrights agenda, built around the ideas of its more social democratic exponents such as Amartya \nSen and Martha Nussbaum, represented the kind of radical universalism that could challenge \nthe status quo of our \u2018flat post-ideological world\u2019.34 Halliday championed this programme \ninstitutionally as the first director of LSE\u2019s Centre for the Study of Human Rights, which he \nestablished alongside the committed advocacy of Stan Cohen and Margo Picken. Typically, \nHalliday\u2019s endorsement of rights was decisive: \u2018the right to independence, to decent \ngovernment, to individual security, to education, to basic human respect and equality are as \nuniversal as the rising and setting of the sun\u2019.35 For Halliday, support for human rights, which \nhe dubbed (following Cohen) \u2018the last grand narrative\u2019, was unequivocal.  \nFor Halliday, therefore, \u2018internationalism\u2019 encompassed three core dimensions: a \nprocess of capitalist-driven interdependence whether understood as the uneven harbinger of \n                                                 \n31 Halliday, \u2018Social Science and Middle East\u2019. Such a conviction led Halliday away from academic \nboycotts, which he saw as diametrically opposed to the core tasks of the academic endeavour: to \nlisten, argue, contest and, where necessary, disagree.  \n32 Ibid. \n33 Halliday, World at 2000, 147. \n34 Ibid., 142. \n35 Halliday, \u2018Social Science and the Middle East\u2019. \n \n14 \nconflict or as the progressive tool of development; a principle of human universality centred \non rights, equality and democracy; and a practice of transnational cooperation and solidarity, \nparticularly when this came to opposing autocratic regimes. It brought together the \ngeopolitical, methodological, analytical and normative aspects of international relations, and \nunderlay the tensions between convergence and fragmentation at the heart of the modern \ninternational order. Halliday\u2019s commitment to internationalism may not have been free from \ncreative tensions \u2013 for example, there was a reluctance to apply to the notion of rights the \nsame ideology-critique and materialist analysis he so ably deployed against identity politics. \nBut his commitment, rooted in Enlightenment values of reason, universalism and secularism, \nwas deeply felt. It also served as the intellectual backdrop for his disciplinary interventions. \n \nInternational Relations: Theory, Gender, Revolution  \nAs with many others before him, Halliday saw IR as occupying a marginal place in the social \nsciences: \u2018International Relations is a supernumerary element, an option for students, a \npenultimate chapter for the scholar\u2019.36 The problems associated with the subaltern place of IR \nwere multiple, not least because it produced either denial (pre-1989) or exaggeration (post-\n1989) of the influence of \u2018the international\u2019. Instead, Halliday made a passionate case for the \nconstant ways in which international relations helped to shape historical development: \n \nThe \u201cinternational\u201d is not something out there, an area of policy that occasionally \nintrudes in the form of bombs or higher oil prices, but which can conventionally be \nignored \u2026 the requirements of inter-state competition explain much of the \ndevelopment of the modern state, while the mobilisation of domestic resources and \ninternal constraints act for much of states\u2019 success in this competition. Disciplines \nsuch as political science and sociology, on the one hand, and IR, on the other, are \nlooking at two dimensions of the same process: without undue intrusion or denial of \nthe specificity of the other, this might suggest a fruitful interrelationship.37 \n \nHalliday\u2019s theoretical interest in IR, like his work on the Middle East, was concerned with \nspecifying IR\u2019s core domain (a broader domain, he thought, than was often taken to be the \ncase) and demonstrating its interrelationship with other disciplines. Indeed, when scholars \nstudied the emergence of modern states, the expansion of the market, or dynamics of war and \nrevolution, they were already studying the ways in which international relations interlaced \nwith domestic processes: \u2018there can be no purely national history of any states; equally there \ncan be no theory of the economy, the state or social relations that denies the formative, not \n                                                 \n36 Halliday, Rethinking IR, 2. \n37 Ibid., 20. \n \n15 \njust residual or recent, impact of the international\u2019.38 In short, the \u2018myth of the bounded \nsociety\u2019 was as pervasive \u2013 and as unscholarly \u2013 as that of the stork.39  \n \nIR Theory \nBut what specifically did IR offer the social sciences? And on what theoretical terrain was IR \nto take part in interdisciplinary conversations? On these questions, Halliday was less clear. \nOn the one hand, Halliday saw IR as concerned with a range of analytic concerns (foreign \npolicy, interventions, international law etc.) which it was particularly well placed to examine. \nAlongside this was a set of distinctive normative challenges (questions over the legitimate \nuse of force, the rights and wrongs of intervention, \u2018our\u2019 responsibility to \u2018others\u2019, and so on). \nOn the other hand, Halliday did not lay out, either theoretically or substantively, what made \nthese domain areas discrete, nor how they were to serve as devices for interdisciplinary \ninteractions. In some ways, no doubt, such an omission was deliberate. After all, if the world \nwas messy, then disciplines could not legitimately guard their terrain like the academic \nequivalent of homeland security agents. And there is little doubt that, rather than generate a \nprogrammatic view of IR replete with hardcore assumptions supported by auxiliary \nhypothesis, Halliday preferred a more eclectic enterprise couched between the empiricist \nfallacy of \u2018facts without theory\u2019 and the metatheoretical inclination towards \u2018abstraction \nwithout content\u2019: \u2018IR, like all branches of knowledge, faces two dangers \u2013 that of factual \naccounts devoid of theoretical reflections, explanatory or ethical, and that of theory \nunchecked in, or untested by, the analysis of history itself\u2019.40 In other words, between the \ntwin dangers of a \u2018futile cult of facts\u2019 and a \u2018pretentious cult of abstraction\u2019 lay fertile \nterrain.41 This terrain was occupied, for Halliday, by historical sociology.  \nIf historical sociology is conventionally understood as a dialogue between Marx and \nWeber, then Halliday\u2019s thinking straddled both sides of this dialogue, at times uneasily. The \nMarxist dimension of his work took many forms. First amongst these, as noted in the \nprevious section, was that Halliday saw the emergence of industrial capitalism as the core \nconcern of IR, serving as the central imperative behind processes of state formation and inter-\n                                                 \n38 Ibid., 4. \n39 Fred Halliday, \u2018For an International Sociology\u2019, in Historical Sociology of International Relations \ned. Stephen Hobden and John M. Hobson (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005): 244-64. \n40 Halliday, Rethinking IR, ix.  \n41 In his more uncharitable moments, Halliday described this \u2018cult of abstraction\u2019 as \u2018Floor 7 disease\u2019, \nreferring to the 7th Floor of Clement House at LSE where the offices of Millennium are housed. More \ncharitably, he associated such a position with that taken by C. Wright Mills in his, The Sociological \nImagination (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1959). \n \n16 \nstate competition. Halliday also regularly used class as an analytical category, seeing the \nemergence of stratification, particularly in its transnational form, as one of IR\u2019s principal \nareas of enquiry. As with other Marxist-inspired scholars, Halliday sought to historicize \ntaken-for-granted assumptions about the world, seeing the emergence of ideas, institutions \nand associated international practices as embedded within specific historical contexts. At the \nsame time, he shared a Marxist concern with the ways in which conflict in general, and wars \nand revolution in particular, had shaped the modern international order.  \nHalliday\u2019s Weberian influences were also keenly felt. First, there was his obvious \nadmiration for Weberian scholars such as Raymond Aron, C. Wright Mills, Michael Mann \nand Charles Tilly, even if Halliday was not always convinced that their rich analysis of the \ndomestic realm was matched by comparable attention to the international sphere.42 Second, \nthere was Halliday\u2019s endorsement of a Weberian understanding of the state as a set of \nadministrative-coercive apparatuses rather than the legal-territorial unit usually employed in \nIR.43 For Halliday, the former not only offered greater conceptual clarity, it also drew \nattention away from a mistaken sense of the state as a pristine, unitary actor towards a more \ncompelling toolkit concerned with how state-society complexes were forged and shaped by \nthe violent intersection of international and domestic processes. The Treaty of Westphalia, \nHalliday reminded his IR audiences, was one which allowed state leaders to coerce their own \npeople with relative impunity. And states more generally had arisen as administrative bodies \nwhich imposed order on their subjects in order to raise taxes which, in turn, were used to fund \ninter-state wars. Only much later did states become, contingently in Halliday\u2019s view, \nrepresentative. Rather, the history of the modern state was one of violent oppression.  \nAlthough Halliday trailed a significant path for historical sociology in IR, it is fair to \nsay that he did not offer a definitive theoretical statement of his own on the subject.44 Indeed, \n                                                 \n42 See, for example, his chiding of Mills along these lines: Fred Halliday, \u2018The Contradictions of C. \nWright Mills\u2019, Millennium 23, no. 2 (1994): 377-85; and his slightly more guarded challenges to \nMichael Mann in: Fred Halliday, \u2018He\u2019s Not Finished Yet: Achievements and Challenges in the Work \nof Michael Mann\u2019 Millennium 34, no. 2 (2006): 509-16.  \n43 Fred Halliday, \u2018State and Society in International Relations: A Second Agenda\u2019, Millennium 16, no. \n2 (1987): 215-29. \n44 Halliday supervised to completion over fifty PhD\u2019s during his time at LSE, including many works \nof historical sociology. A selective sample includes: Justin Rosenberg, The Empire of Civil Society \n(London: Verso, 1994); Richard Saull, The State, Military Power and Social Revolution (London: \nFrank Cass, 2001); Alejandro Col\u00e1s, Social Movements in World Politics (Cambridge: Polity, 2002); \nNick Bisley, The End of the Cold War and the Causes of Soviet Collapse (Basingstoke: Palgrave, \n2004); George Lawson, Negotiated Revolutions (London: Ashgate, 2005); Maryam Panah, The \nIslamic Republic and the World (London: Pluto, 2007); and Amnon Aran, Israel\u2019s Foreign Policy \nTowards the PLO (Brighton: Sussex Academic Press, 2009). \n \n17 \nHalliday often appeared as a curiously miscellaneous theorist. He remained wedded to a \ntripartite understanding of international theory as inter-state (realist), transnational (liberal) \nand systemic (structural\/Marxist) which had held sway at LSE when he joined the \ndepartment, largely through the influence of Martin Wight.45 And he retained an admiration \nfor figures like the conservative parliamentarian Edmund Burke, whom he considered to be \none of the only figures to understand the tendency of the international realm towards \n\u2018homogeneity\u2019. But despite Halliday\u2019s tendency to dabble in theoretically diverse waters, two \nfeatures of his approach to historical sociology were consistently applied: first, the need to \ndenaturalize taken-for-granted understandings and practices of international order, whether \nthis took the form of absolutist monarchy, capitalist modernity or patriarchy; and second, the \nneed to study the success \u2013 and failures \u2013 of individuals and movements who had challenged \nthese structures of domination. In this fundamental sense, Halliday was concerned with \nhuman agency \u2013 the ways in which people \u2018took mastery\u2019 of their surroundings, \u2018emancipated \nthemselves\u2019 from the conditions of their servitude and, thereby, \u2018determined their own \nfutures\u2019.46 For all his interest in long-run, structural processes (market expansion, state \ndevelopment, cultural hybridity), Halliday was acutely aware of the \u2018cunning of history\u2019 \u2013 the \nways in which accident, contingency and luck played their part in historical processes. \nIndeed, he was \u2018humanist\u2019 in this most basic sense of all, seeing hope, aspiration and the \ncapacity of people to imagine alternatives as the central drama of human history.   \nDespite this concern with the unexpected in history, and with all due regard for the \nmodesty and caution which he saw this as requiring of social scientists, Halliday saw the true \ntest of a theory as its explanatory power. Indeed, he was scathing of areas of study, \nparticularly post-modernism, which did not see explanation as their core motivation. \nHalliday\u2019s distaste for post-positivist approaches, however, was not total. He shared with \nthese approaches a desire to destabilise taken-for-granted assumptions, contest status-quo \nhierarchies and subvert the \u2018natural\u2019 order of things. And Halliday was as concerned as any \npost-structuralist with the fusion of power-knowledge and the disciplinary features of \ndiscourse and rhetoric, as apparent in his invocation for all students to learn a language \n(Halliday spoke twelve languages fluently himself), his interest in etymology (a dictionary of \n                                                 \n45 Indeed, Halliday was gracious in both conversation and print about the English School \u2013 an \napproach he saw as a major improvement on neo-realism and associated positions, not least in the \ncapacity of its advocates to take history, social change and international hierarchy seriously. Indeed, \nin the speech given at his farewell dinner in May 2008, Halliday implored his colleagues to tell their \nmore methodologically-infatuated students: \u2018let them read Geoffrey Stern\u2019.  \n46 Halliday, \u2018For an International Sociology\u2019. \n \n18 \nthe post-9\/11 world was finished shortly before his death),47 and his love of jokes (which, \nlike Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, he took extremely seriously).48 Indeed, despite his materialist base, \nHalliday spent considerable time exploring the ways in which ideas motivated people to \naction, most notably during revolutions, or in how symbolic tropes were exploited politically. \nHence, in his analysis of the end of the Cold War, Halliday claimed that, \u2018it was the T-shirt \nand the supermarket, not the gunboat or the cheaper manufacturers, that destroyed the \nlegitimacy and stability of the Soviet regime. Bruce Springsteen was the late twentieth \ncentury equivalent of the Opium Wars\u2019.49 \nHowever, Halliday\u2019s frustration with post-modernism was deeply felt: \u2018if you are \nbeing tortured, it makes little sense to be told that you are suffering from Western imperialist \ninfluence or totalitarian Enlightenment rationality and should instead appreciate the irony of \nthe situation in which you find yourself. It is rather hard to deconstruct the torturer\u2019s \nelectrodes\u2019.50 Halliday\u2019s commitment to rationalism and explanation led him to see post-\nmodernism as lacking the substantive foundations by which to assess rival historical and, \nindeed, normative claims. \u2018Explanation\u2019, he argued, \u2018is the only antidote to myth\u2019.51 \nLikewise, Halliday\u2019s use of concepts such as progress, universalism and emancipation put \nhim at odds with what he regarded as post-modernism\u2019s slavish regard (or at least apoliticised \ndisregard) for exclusionary beliefs and practices. In keeping with his sense of IR as a \ncomprador discipline which ingested the latest fad and passed it on without adding any value \nto it, Halliday had no time for the recycled way in which post-structuralism in IR was \nimbibed. What worked as literary critique or aesthetic jape, Halliday thought, turned into \nsomething much more serious, and more supine, in IR. His critique of the post-modern \u2018zone \nof half-truth, fabrication and petty mindedness\u2019 was damning:52  \n \nWitty incantations about alterity, dissolution and freeze-frames, and exaggerated \nclaims about what has changed about the world are no substitute for a substantive \nengagement with history or a plausible concept of the alternatives for political and \ntheoretical change. Rather too inebriated with its own phrases, post-modernism in \nsocial science runs the risk of becoming the new banality, a set of assertions as \n                                                 \n47 Fred Halliday, Shocked and Awed (London: I.B. Tauris, 2010). \n48 This is not the place to detail the many ways in which Halliday used humour in order to illustrate \nserious points, but three of his favourite sayings are worth recalling: \u2018history repeats itself: the first \ntime as tragedy, the second time as farce, the third time as a fad in IR Theory\u2019; \u2018the ESRC is a four \nletter word\u2019; \u2018one good post-graduate seminar is worth a thousand anti-ageing creams\u2019. \n49 Rethinking IR, 97.  \n50 Halliday, \u2018Obiter Dicta\u2019, 20. \n51 Halliday, Myth of Confrontation, viii.  \n52 Fred Halliday, International Relations: A Critical Introduction, Unpublished Manuscript, 108. \n \n19 \nunlocated and useless as the vacuous generalisations \u2013 be they balance of power or \nprogressivist teleology \u2013 that they seek to displace.53  \n \nGender  \nNowhere did Halliday\u2019s frustrations with post-modernism boil over more readily than in \ndiscussions of gender. The pride Halliday showed in establishing (with Margot Light) the \nfirst course on \u2018Women and IR\u2019 in the world and organising the first ever conference on IR \nand gender was matched only by the frustration he felt with how the field developed \nsubsequently.54 Although Halliday\u2019s interest in gender issues was long-standing, not least \nthrough engagement with the work of his wife Maxine Molyneux, it took novel form during \nhis time at LSE. Halliday\u2019s basic motivation was simple \u2013 a rebellion against the idea that IR \ncould be \u2018neutral\u2019 in terms of gender. In fact, his challenge to the subject was the reverse: \n\u2018there is no area of international relations that does not have a gendered dimension\u2019.55 \nAlthough Halliday did not take this challenge on in any systematic sense (and did not \nsupervise any PhD\u2019s in the area), he was quick to \u2018mainstream\u2019 gender debates in research \nand teaching, whether this involved discussing colonial attempts at population control or the \nsystematic use of rape in war. And his challenge was taken-on by many of his colleagues, \nalbeit with varying degrees of commitment and, at times, resistance. Halliday also ensured \nthat Cynthia Enloe\u2019s Bananas, Beaches and Bases became one of the \u2018great books\u2019 taught on \nthe core course for the MSc International Relations at LSE.56  \nHalliday was also much occupied with the \u2018masculinisation\u2019 of discourse in IR. \nIndeed, he had no trouble identifying that one of the reasons for disquiet over Robert Kagan\u2019s \ncontention that \u2018Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus\u2019 was that Kagan\u2019s \nconceit served to effeminise Europeans.57 But, in general, Halliday\u2019s critique of the post-\nmodern infatuation with discourse crossed over into his work on gender. Indeed, he railed \nagainst the \u2018sabotage\u2019 of an \u2018add epistemology and stir\u2019 approach which demonstrated a \n\u2018submission to the banalities of intellectual fashion which could lead gender issues to be \n\u201chidden\u201d again under a new vapidity\u2019.58 This \u2018epistemological hypochondria\u2019, Halliday \nargued, stripped women of meaningful agency and offered no tools by which to fight gender-\n                                                 \n53 Fred Halliday, Review of Rob Walker, \u2018Inside\/Outside\u2019, Millennium 22, no. 2 (1993): 365.  \n54 Edited proceedings from the conference were later published as: Rebecca Grant and Kathleen \nNewland eds., Gender and International Relations (Milton Keynes: Open University Press, 1991). \n55 Halliday, Rethinking IR, chapter 7. \n56 Cynthia Enloe, Bananas, Beaches and Bases (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001). \n57 Robert Kagan, Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order (New York: \nAtlantic, 2004).  \n58 Rethinking IR, 169.  \n \n20 \nderived inequalities. The result, he argued, was a \u2018misplaced anthropological generosity\u2019 \ntowards practises which were anathema to the international women\u2019s movement, let alone \ngoals of universal emancipation.59  \nOverall, Halliday argued that the record was mixed when it came to assessing \nprogress in both the academic study of gender and the substantive positions of women in \nworld politics. On the latter, it was possible to chart tangible advances: the recognition and \nprosecution of gender-related violence as a war crime; gender issues linked officially to the \npreservation of international peace and security; and the integration of gender concerns into \nthe work of the World Bank. Likewise, on the former, gender had become a meaningful \nconcept and its associated scholarly pursuit the subject of serious books, articles, conferences \nand courses, even if many of these took place outside IR. However, Halliday also warned of a \n\u2018backlash\u2019: the limited funding given to gender issues; the cultural conservatism, whether of \nthe White House or the Vatican, which sought to block gender-relevant policies at \ninternational conferences; and the 100 million women which Amartya Sen argued were \nmissing in the Third World, something Sen correlated to a dearth of educational and \nemployment opportunities.60 Theoretically, Halliday warned both against post-positivist \nsectarianism, which he saw as immobilising the discussion of gendered structures of \noppression, and attempts to neuter gender concerns via a flight to rational choice: \n \nGender inequality, reinforced through the family, the workplace, the media, religion \nand the place of study, is a global phenomenon, universally present and \ntransnationally reproduced \u2026 women remain the victims of violence, discrimination \nand oppression worldwide. That is why the study of this gendered inequality, not least \nin its international and transnational dimensions, should be a central concern of the \ncontemporary social sciences.61 \n \nHalliday\u2019s interventions on gender and IR were rooted in a familiar orientation \u2013 his \ndesire to uphold Enlightenment principles of rationality, critical reason and universality. As \nsuch, it is little surprise that he was more at home with the work of Martha Nussbaum and \nAmartya Sen than he was with post-positivist IR. There were, as ever, unanswered questions \n                                                 \n59 Fred Halliday\u2019, \u2018Hidden from International Relations: Women and the International Arena\u2019, \nMillennium 17, no. 3 (1988): 419-28.

First, at no point did Halliday carry out overtly gender-oriented research \non any substantive area of IR, including revolutions \u2013 as such, he was not completely \nsuccessful in \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 gender in his own work. Second, although Halliday\u2019s desire to \navoid the valorisation of marginal voices and dissident approaches for their own sake was an \nimportant corrective, he could have done more to engage with variations within feminist \nthought, including those originating from a non-Western context. Nevertheless, his \nreassertion of feminist principles in a time when public discourse was being \u2018re-masculinised\u2019 \nand issues of equal pay, domestic labour and asymmetrical life-chances were increasingly \nconsidered as pass\u00e9 meant that his critique retained considerable force. And the pioneering \nrole which Halliday played in introducing gender concerns to IR led, over time, to the \nestablishment of courses, conferences and working groups which could easily, if mistakenly, \nbe taken for granted some twenty years later.  \n \nRevolution \nLike Hannah Arendt, Halliday saw war and revolution as the two \u2018master processes\u2019 of the \ntwentieth century. Although IR paid due attention to the former, Halliday argued, there was \nno equivalent interest in revolution: no Cromwell Professor of Revolutionary Studies; no \nPaine Institute for the Study of Revolutionary Change; indeed, very little study of revolution \nat all.62 This omission, Halliday thought, represented a significant aporia, one he hoped to fill \nwith a customary sense of judicious assessment. On the one hand, Halliday sought to rescue \nrevolution from the \u2018complacent rejection\u2019 of conservative theorists, particularly after 1989. \nHence, \u2018there are few things less becoming to the study of human affairs than the \ncomplacency of a triumphal age\u2019.63 On the other hand, Halliday was equally determined to \npay due heed to the \u2018romanticised celebration of blood, mendacity and coercion\u2019 offered by \nuncritical supporters of revolution.64 For Halliday, although revolutions were often heroic, \nthey were also cynical. And for all their power to create novel social orders, revolutions were \nalso deeply destructive.  \nHalliday wrote extensively on revolution, both before and during his time at LSE, \ncoming to see it as the \u2018sixth great power\u2019 of the modern era, equivalent in influence to the \npentarchy which Marx saw as dominating international relations during the nineteenth \n                                                 \n62 Rethinking IR, chapter 6. \n63 Fred Halliday, Revolution and World Politics (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 1999): 1. \n64 Fred Halliday, \u2018Revolutionary Internationalism and its Perils\u2019, in Revolution in the Making of the \nModern World, eds. John Foran, David Lane and Andreja Zivkovic (London: Routledge, 2008): 65-\n80. \n \n22 \ncentury.65 There were two main reasons for this assessment. First, revolution offered an \nalternative periodisation of the modern international order, recalibrating the sixteenth century \nas a time of political and ideological struggle unleashed by the European Reformations, re-\nestablishing the central optic of the seventeenth century around the upheavals which followed \nthe Dutch Revolt and the English Revolution, re-centring the eighteenth and nineteenth \ncenturies around the Atlantic Revolutions of France, America and Haiti, and understanding \nthe \u2018short twentieth century\u2019 as one in which the primary logic was the challenge \u2013 and \ncollapse \u2013 of the Bolshevik Revolution and its Third World inheritors.  \n Second, revolutions offered a \u2018dual challenge\u2019 to International Relations. On the one \nhand, revolutions offered a tangible commitment to an alternative international order. \nWhether seen in the world revolutionary map of Jean-Baptiste (Anacharsis) Cloots in the \n1790s, Lenin\u2019s desire to see a weltklasse, weltpartei, weltrevolution (global class, global \nparty, global revolution) or Cuba\u2019s support for insurrections in many parts of the Third \nWorld, revolutions provided a systemic challenge to the existing order. This challenge came \nfrom military pressure and the formation of new alliances, the development of alternative \ntrading patterns and modes of development, and through the force of example. Although \nrevolutions did not succeed in exporting their model and reforging the world in their own \nimage, their challenge was multiple in form and systemic in scope. However, Halliday was \naware that the relationship between revolutions and the international sphere was not singular. \nRather, in order to function in the international realm, revolutionary states had to trade, \nestablish diplomatic relations and make strategic choices, choices which often accommodated \nrival powers. If this was some way short of domestication or \u2018socialisation\u2019, nevertheless \nrevolutionary regimes were caught in an unequal struggle with international forces, one they \ncould not win.66 Indeed, the often tenuous nature of revolutionary regimes, besieged from \nwithout and within by counter-revolutionary forces, meant that they took claims to domestic \nsovereignty and state security extremely seriously. As such, they often served to strengthen \nthe very states-system which they sought to undermine.  \nHalliday did not see revolution merely as an important topic for IR \u2013 he also thought \nthat IR had much to offer sociological and historical accounts of revolution. First, \ninternational factors (defeat in war, rapid economic change, shifting alliance structures) often \nprecipitated and prompted revolutionary crisis. Second, international actors played a major \n                                                 \n65 Karl Marx, \u2018The European War\u2019, New York Daily Tribune, 2 February 1854. \n66 On revolutionary \u2018socialisation\u2019, see: David Armstrong, Revolution and World Order (Oxford: \nOxford University Press, 1993). \n \n23 \nrole in encouraging revolutions via arms, aid and demonstration effect. Finally, revolutionary \nforeign policies attempted to export their revolution, albeit with mixed success. As such, IR \nscholarship aided the general study of revolution by making apparent the modular features of \nrevolution: the \u2018period of grace\u2019 offered to revolutionary regimes as foreign powers assessed \nits challenge; \u2018active confrontation\u2019 as this challenge was met by counter-revolution; and \nfinally, long-term \u2018accommodation\u2019 as both sides of the conflict took part in symbiotic, if \nunequal, exchanges. The history of international relations also demonstrated that, for all the \n\u2018voluntarist delusions\u2019 of revolutionaries from Trotsky to Guevara, the particular context in \nwhich revolutions emerged meant that emulation was, at best, a remote possibility.67  \nIf Halliday\u2019s work on revolution produced a research agenda brimming with vitality, \nit also left behind a number of loose ends. First, in keeping with his desire to interlace \nnormative and analytical registers, Halliday was keen to stimulate discussion of the ethical \ndimensions of revolutions. Criticising the lack of a tradition of \u2018ius ad revolutionem\u2019 or \u2018ius \nin revolutione\u2019 which could match debates around \u2018just war\u2019, Halliday argued that such \ndiscussion was crucial lest revolutionary excesses be excused by those (advocates and \ntheorists) who saw revolution as inevitable.68 This agenda remains to be filled in. Second, \nHalliday rejected the possibility of generating a theory of revolutionary change \u2013 rather, he \nhad a tendency to move from abstract levels of analysis (for example, the dictum (following \nLenin) that revolutions took place when \u2018rulers could not go on ruling and the ruled could no \nlonger go on being ruled\u2019) to detailed analysis of individual cases.69 Some of this analysis \nwas brilliant. But it was also frustrating in its failure to construct a schema, however \nproximate, by which to study revolutions outside their specific instantiations.70 Finally, as \nwith his political orientation more generally, it is fair to say that Halliday\u2019s views on \nrevolutions mellowed over the course of his career: from enthusiastic celebration of \nemancipatory struggles in the 1960s and 1970s to a more sober acceptance of the \u2018dual \nnature\u2019 of revolutions from the 1980s on. Although convinced that the exploitation, \noppression, inequality and waste of the contemporary world left states vulnerable to \nchallenges from below, Halliday was hostile to most forms of contemporary resistance to this \norder, which he described as \u2018a fungible crew of ruckus societies, windbags and conspiracy \n                                                 \n67 Halliday, Revolution and World Politics, 129. \n68 Fred Halliday, \u2018Revolution and the International\u2019, Millennium 24, no. 2 (1995): 279-87. \n69 A point made by several critics, including: Stephen Walt, \u2018Nothing Revolutionary\u2019, Review of \nInternational Studies 27, no. 4 (2001): 687-92.  \n70 Indeed, Halliday\u2019s major statement on the subject \u2013 Revolution and World Politics \u2013 ably illustrates \nthis tendency: its irrepressible empirical synthesis is not matched by a comparable depth of theoretical \ninsight. \n \n24 \ntheorists\u2019.71 It is not difficult to understand Halliday\u2019s distaste for this \u2018movement of \nmovements\u2019 \u2013 he considered contemporary insurgents to be utopian without a concomitant \nsense of realism, guilty of an amnesia towards the history of revolutionary success and \nfailure, and holding, at best, a fuzzy conception of revolutionary agency.72 However, it may \nbe that Halliday\u2019s dismissal came too readily. He swept together a number of disparate causes \nwithin his critique of contemporary revolutionary movements and there were overlaps \nbetween at least some of these movements and his work than he realised.  \n \nAchievements, ambivalences and openings \nThe themes we have discussed in this article only hint at Fred Halliday\u2019s panoramic \ninfluence. We have left assessment of his work on the Middle East to other, more expert, \nwitnesses. We have not engaged in any great detail with Halliday\u2019s role as a public \nintellectual. Nor have we explored some of his more mischievous projects, such as his list of \nCold War Assassinations, a whodunit which runs to nearly ten pages.73 Indeed, a figure like \nHalliday is impossible to capture fully \u2013 he remained a young man in a hurry throughout his \nlife: insatiable, curious and uninhibited. Perhaps his greatest legacy is as an educator in the \nwidest possible sense of the word, a deeply informed guide who would captivate with \nanecdotes and stories, analytical insights and historical exemplifications drawn from far-off \nplaces about which many around him knew little: Yemen, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Cuba, Tibet \nand more.  \nIt is fair to say that, for all the brio, range and scope of his work, Halliday did not \ndeliver a \u2018great statement\u2019 or, indeed, write a \u2018great book\u2019. Although he attempted to reach \nNorth American audiences via his IR scholarship, this was, for the most part, in vain; he was \nmuch better known in the United States as an area studies specialist.74 Politically, too, there \nwere areas where Halliday\u2019s stance could be questioned, for example the Soviet invasion of \n                                                 \n71 Fred Halliday, \u2018Getting Real about Seattle\u2019, Millennium 29, no. 1 (2000): 123-9. \n72 Fred Halliday, \u2018The Challenge for \u201cRevolution\u201d in our Times\u2019 in The Future of Revolution, ed. John \nForan (London: Zed, 2001): 300-9. \n73 This was no idle project for Halliday \u2013 many of his friends and colleagues were murdered during \nthe Cold War, including Orlando Letelier, the former Chilean Foreign Minister, and Ronni Moffitt, an \nAmerican political activist, colleagues of Halliday\u2019s at the Institute for Policy Studies who died when \na car bomb, planted by agents from General Pinochet\u2019s secret police, was detonated in downtown \nWashington in September 1976.   \n74 This may not just be the case in North America \u2013 Google Scholar shows that Halliday\u2019s books and \narticles on the Middle East are, in general, more heavily referenced than those on IR. A sense of \nHalliday\u2019s frustration with mainstream IR can be gauged in his interview with Kenneth Waltz: Fred \nHalliday and Justin Rosenberg, \u2018Interview with Ken Waltz\u2019, Review of International Studies 24, no. 3 \n(1998): 371-86.  \n \n25 \nAfghanistan, the first Gulf War and the Ethiopian revolution, where his support for forceful \nstate intervention was difficult to square with his commitment to solidarity with the \noppressed. Indeed, it was not always clear how Halliday cashed-in his commitment to \nsolidarity or how he adjudicated between rival claims of oppression.75 When it came to IR, \nHalliday felt that he had \u2018lost\u2019 on many areas that he cared deeply about: the study of \nrevolutions remained relatively marginal to the discipline, much of IR theory continued to be \ndominated by methodological narcissists and metatheoretical scholastics, while gender \nstudies became, for all his exhortations, a predominantly post-positivist enterprise. But if \nHalliday felt a sense of frustration at these \u2018failures\u2019, this did not induce resignation. Rather, \nHalliday fought time and again for his normative orientations, political commitments and \ndisciplinary convictions. Indeed, he saw intellectual life as a vocation \u2013 and a fortunate one at \nthat \u2013 hence the admonition to the assembled hordes at his final valedictory lecture: \u2018scholars \nof the world unite! You have nothing to lose but your shame\u2019.76 \nAlong with Zhou Enlai\u2019s assessment of the French Revolution, therefore, it is \u2018too \nearly to tell\u2019 what Halliday\u2019s principal achievements are. Nevertheless, it is possible to \nprovide a provisional \u2018balance sheet\u2019 (to use one of Halliday\u2019s favourite terms) about his \nmain contributions \u2013 and challenges \u2013 to IR. First, the discipline. For Halliday, IR was host to \nan especially lethal cocktail in which ignorance was matched only by arrogance: \u2018the world \nof international relations is a carnival of the bluff and the philistine\u2019.77 The nature of IR as a \ncomprador discipline meant that it needed to keep its eyes and ears open to what was going \non elsewhere: \u2018you can no more work in an academic discipline by looking only at its internal \ndevelopments than you can write the history of a nation or society, or the life of a person, by \nlooking just at their internal development\u2019.78 IR was a social science, no more and no less. \nAnd it was one which needed to respond to, as well as explain, big issues and processes. \nWriting soon after the end of the Cold War, Halliday listed a range of subjects which could \nconstitute a \u2018new agenda\u2019 for IR: ecological issues, weapons proliferation, migration, \u2018new \nsecurity threats\u2019 such as AIDS and drugs, terrorism (including the need to divorce it from \nIslam), and more.79 It does not stand as a bad list some twenty years on. Nor does his defence \nof a resolutely secular discipline oriented towards the critical examination of modernity\u2019s \n                                                 \n75 Thanks to Mick Cox and Paul Kirby for raising these points. \n76 This phrase, which appeared in the first Mandarin (mis)translation of the Communist Manifesto in \n1910, was one Halliday used to close his final lecture at LSE. \n77 Fred Halliday, \u2018International Relations: A Critical Introduction\u2019, unpublished manuscript, 27. \n78 Foreword to an unpublished manuscript, written in Barcelona, dated November 2006, 1. \n79 Fred Halliday, \u2018IR: Is There a New Agenda?\u2019 Millennium 20, no. 1 (1991): 57-72. \n \n26 \nruptures. This discipline, he hoped, would be governed less by methodological strictures than \nby a commitment to empirical engagement, explanation and critical reason. Such a view \nrepresents both a fertile disciplinary imagination and a potentially fruitful research agenda.   \nSecond, a more general lesson: the need to be open not just to other disciplines but to \nhistorical events. Dates played an important part in Halliday\u2019s development as a scholar: \n1968 demonstrated the challenges and possibilities of concerted collective action against \ncapitalist inequity; 1979 highlighted the challenge that militant Islam posed for the Left; 1989 \ntriggered a rethink of what it meant to be \u2018Left\u2019 after the passing of state socialism; while \n9\/11 refocused his work on the roles that culture and identity \u2013 and their misinterpretation \u2013 \nplayed in contemporary international relations. Following the end of the Cold War, Halliday \nargued that it was time to confine three historical legacies to the dustbin of world history: the \nSoviet Union\u2019s bequeathing of ethnic conflict, kleptocracy and inept authoritarianism; the \nWest\u2019s history of imperialism, market fundamentalism and arrogance; and the international \nLeft\u2019s \u2018children\u2019s crusade of demagogues and recycled bunkeristas\u2019.80 In other words, what \nHalliday wanted to see was a \u2018worldy social science\u2019 in which scholars took seriously their \nethical convictions, political motivations and subject orientations \u2013 mining each deeply, \npaying close attention to contestations between them and refining each, often in relation to \nimportant events, along the way. The last thing he wanted was anyone to say at his funeral: \n\u2018Comrade Haliday never wavered\u2019. Waver in terms of learning from events Halliday may \nhave done. But he never wavered in his campaign against methodological anaesthesia, \ncultural parochialism or theoretical domestication. Rather, Halliday\u2019s lesson was simple, but \neffective: to conduct research with a critical, engaged and open mind, and to never lose sight \nof the most important skills an academic can have \u2013 curiosity, intuition and judgement.  \nThird, the most general lesson of all: to take the ambivalences of modernity as the \nstarting point for IR. As we have seen, Halliday took IR seriously, but not too seriously. IR \nmay have had important things to contribute to social science but this was a process of mutual \nexchange rather than a one-way street. As such, IR needed to share with other social sciences \na concern with capitalist modernity, in particular the \u2018dark side\u2019 of this process. When it came \nto globalisation, for example, Halliday favoured a research agenda oriented around people \ntrafficking, the movement of arms and drugs, and transnational criminality than one geared at \nbacchanal experiments in global governance or vacuous talk of time-space compression. As \nhe noted, there were many things that could neither be hurried nor done any more quickly in \n                                                 \n80 Fred Halliday, \u2018It\u2019s Time to Bin the Past\u2019, The Observer 30 January 2005.  \n \n27 \nthe contemporary world: boiling an egg, falling in love or building a democratic culture. And \nbecause Halliday took the word progress seriously, he did not take it for granted. As he knew \nonly too well, there was nothing inevitable about a world built around dynamics of coercion \nand resistance, and on historical accident as well as broader structural determinations. As \nsuch, contemporary international relations was less an \u2018iron cage\u2019 than a \u2018rubber cage\u2019 which \ncontained some degree of \u2018plastic control\u2019 for its actors.81  \n \nA truly international order, in which diversity of culture and pluralism of political \ncommunity are inserted within a global ethical, institutional and social order, remains \non the agenda, a project which may one day be realised. But there is little in the \ncontemporary world to lead us to believe that this is, in any continent, a proximate \npossibility. There are islands of progress, but this is not sufficient: cosmopolis in one \ncountry is not an option.82   \n \nCosmopolis may not have been an imminent option, but it was \u2018improbably possible\u2019 rather \nthan \u2018probably impossible\u2019.83 Halliday\u2019s commitment to achieving such internationalist goals, \ndespite geopolitical turbulence and cultural \u2018backlash\u2019, was one he maintained throughout his \nlife. It is a struggle which retains much pertinence today. The depth of Halliday\u2019s scholarship \nand the learned, charismatic way in which he reflected on, and took an active role in, world \npolitics ensures that his influence in this long-term struggle will be greatly missed.  \n                                                 \n81 Halliday, Critical Introduction, 30. Halliday was not always sanguine about the extent of this \nmanoeuvrability. In fact, he was fond of citing the former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in \nthis regard. When asked the extent of Canada\u2019s room for manoeuvre in foreign affairs, Trudeau is said \nto have answered, \u2018about 5%\u2019. \n82 Halliday, \u2018Post-Hegemonic World\u2019, 26. \n83 Halliday used this distinction often. It was one he took from W.C. Runciman, The Social Animal \n(London: HarperCollins, 1998). \n"}
