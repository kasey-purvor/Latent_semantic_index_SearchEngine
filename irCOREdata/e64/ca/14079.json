Introduction\nImmersive virtual worlds (IVWs) represent an important opportunity for teaching and learn-\ning. Although they can be used to replicate pedagogical events occurring in real life, they\nalso offer a space to explore new methods of teaching and learning, or to investigate the\nteaching of issues which might be too difficult, dangerous or even impossible to contem-\nplate in real life. Additionally, the social nature of IVWs represents a marked step up from\nsimple discussion boards and forums, broadening communication channels to include social\nand cultural conventions operating in real life, and introducing new ones at the same time.\nHowever, there is currently a paucity of research on IVWs for learning, particularly\nregarding their relationship to pedagogy. More needs to be known about the intersection\nbetween IVWs and pedagogy, and the ways in which IVWs might change the nature of a\ngiven learning experience. Similarly, more research is required to look at the ways in which\nteaching and learning can successfully negotiate and span the boundaries between real and\nvirtual worlds.\n*Corresponding author. Email: j.good@sussex.ac.uk\n164  J. Good et al.\nIn this paper, we report on a case study which investigated the use of Second Life (SL)\nby university students taking an interactive learning environments course to create innova-\ntive learning experiences for external clients (instructors in further education (FE) or higher\neducation (HE)). In particular, we look at how a combination of pedagogical approaches,\nProblem-Based Learning (PBL) and constructionism, were used in conjunction with an\nimmersive virtual world, SL, and at the ways in which the pedagogies and contexts (real and\nvirtual) influenced and enhanced each other. We will argue that IVWs facilitate a series of\nnovel interactions which can address some of the difficulties experienced when implement-\ning PBL.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of the\neducational uses of SL, while Sections 3 and 4 describe the practical and theoretical setting\nfor this work. Section 5 describes the unique contributions that SL can make to PBL, while\nSection 6 provides a brief conclusion.\n2. Educational uses of Second Life\nAn increasing number of universities and colleges are represented in SL; approximately 36\nUK universities have a formal presence in SL at the time of writing. Some are reproductions\nof real-world campuses (e.g. University of Sussex, Leeds Metropolitan University and\nBrunel University), or mix real-life and fantasy buildings such as Coventry University and\nthe University of Hertfordshire. Many inworld university presences, such as the Virtual\nUniversity of Edinburgh and the Heriot-Watt island, take advantage of the freedom offered\nby SL and create buildings and structures according to the needs of their inworld activities.\nUniversity SL presences have received much press attention and are undoubtedly excellent\ntools for marketing and publicity. However, a number of universities have also begun to\nexplore the potential of SL for teaching and learning. Much of this work is in the early\nstages, and there is a noticeable lack of publications which give a full evaluative account of\nteaching and learning projects in SL.\nAt Heriot-Watt University, students on a Multimedia Design course have undertaken SL\nprojects which involved terraforming and building innovative interactive entities, as\ndescribed on the Computers, Creativity and Learning Blog (Judy Robertson, 2008, http:\/\/\njudyrobertson.typepad.com\/judy_robertson\/2008\/01\/index.html). The University of the\nWest of England Research Observatory Blog describes how architecture students have been\ninvolved in the design of their inworld environment (http:\/\/hptftuwe.blogspot.com\/). The\nVirtual University of Edinburgh provides inworld space for teaching courses including\nMasters degrees in E-learning and Design and Digital Media. The University of Warwick\nhas a \u2018maths island\u2019 and Coventry University is also interested in supporting maths teaching\nand learning through SL, and is developing a virtual maths support centre (Savin-Baden and\nChafer 2007). Coventry is also exploring SL\u2019s potential for supporting PBL (Savin-Baden\n2007).\nSL benefits from a vibrant educational community, evidenced, for example, by the very\nactive Second Life Educator\u2019s mailing list (SLED). However, despite the affordances of this\nimmersive virtual world, many SL educational experiences replicate traditional teaching\nscenarios. For example, there are many instances of lecture theatres in which instructors\ncan, and do, give slide presentations, and many examples of teaching in SL are based on\nbehaviourist models with a focus on knowledge transmission. Our investigation forms\nperhaps part of a new trend, as described by Larry Johnson, CEO of the New Media Consor-\ntium (NMC), currently the largest body of educators active in SL: \u201c2007 was a year in\nwhich campuses made their entries into SL in great numbers, and as a result there is a\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   165\nconsiderable critical mass of educational institutions now existent in SL \u2013 more than 1200\neducational islands were created in 2007, \u2026 2008 also promises to see strong educational\nuse of SL, but with a new focus. Projects in 2008 are much more likely to be about creating\nlearning experiences than virtual campuses\u201d (Levine 2008).\nSL has the potential to allow instructors to design learning experiences which embody\na number of different pedagogies, and to combine these pedagogies in potentially new ways.\nAs an example, SL can support situated, active learning through the use of physical simu-\nlations, e.g. a simulation of a computer program, showing how data are processed and\nmanipulated, or an engineering simulation which allows students to explore the workings of\nmachinery. Simulations in education are by no means new. However, they have typically\nbeen single-user applications, where interaction takes place between a single learner and the\nsimulation, rather than between multiple learners and the simulation.\nIn addition to the relative ease with which simulations can be built, SL offers a strong\nsocial component through the possibility for multiple avatars to engage in a given situation\nsimultaneously allowing, for example, multiple learners to engage with one of the simula-\ntions above. However, SL\u2019s immersive nature allows learners not only to interact in situa-\ntions in their role as learners, but to take on and experiment with new identities in the form\nof role-play. For example, learners might be able act out a particularly difficult social care\nencounter, or practice medical diagnosis skills. Here, the ability to change the appearance\nof one\u2019s avatar to fit the role being played, and to create a physical environment which\nmimics the real world, is likely to be a powerful contributor to the veracity of the simulation,\nand hence affect the actor\u2019s willingness to suspend disbelief.\nThis combination of physical simulations with role-play simulations can allow learners\nto simultaneously interact with physical entities and with each other. This, we believe,\nmakes SL a potentially very powerful tool from an educational standpoint, and one we\nwished to explore.\nIn the section below, we describe the initial design for our investigation, covering a\nnumber of practical and contextual issues, before going on to describe the theoretical under-\npinnings.\n3. Method\n3.1. Design\nThe case study was designed in the context of an existing university course on interactive\nlearning environments, where the aim was to investigate the extent to which Second Life\ncould be used to create innovative learning experiences by putting the creation in the hands\nof the students themselves, who would design experiences for other students. The case study\nfocused specifically on issues of process, considering the extent to which the use of Second\nLife in a primarily problem-based learning context changes the nature of the teaching and\nlearning experience.\nWe first established a teaching team, consisting of the paper\u2019s authors. Within the team,\none member was responsible for the overall running and facilitation of the course. Another\nacted as the SL expert, handling issues around access to SL, building, finances allocated to\nstudents, etc. The third was responsible for much of the technology facilitation and was\ninvolved in preparing and running sessions.\nIt was decided that students should work in teams to design a learning experience within\nSL. To ground the experience in a real-life context, project teams were paired with clients\nfrom Sussex Learning Network partner institutions to design learning experiences that corre-\nsponded to real curriculum needs within the vocational learning arena. The clients were\n166  J. Good et al.\nasked to identify issues which were difficult, dangerous or impossible to teach in real life,\nto hold an initial meeting with the student team to outline their problem area, without offer-\ning a solution, and to provide additional input if required during the project. They were also\ninvited to the project presentations, at the end of term, and their feedback was welcomed. A\nmember of the teaching team was available to liaise with clients throughout the project.\nBy pairing external clients with student project teams, we aimed to provide clients with\nlearning experiences which could potentially be used as is, or could form the basis for\nfurther development and\/or reflection. We also wanted students to tackle a real-life\nproblem, rather than one invented simply for the purpose of learning, and to have a tangible\noutput which could be presented to their future employers.\nThe clients selected represented a wide range of curricular areas, including social work,\nnursing, police law and systems thinking, subjects which were well outside of the\nexperience of the students on the course. In designing the project, we were conscious of the\nreal-life requirement for IT professionals to understand and interpret domains and activities\nof which they have little or no direct experience in order to develop appropriate technical\nsolutions, and felt that this experience offered an opportunity to develop skills which would\ntranslate well to real-life employment.\nIn terms of assessment, the SL learning experience comprised one element of a portfolio\nof work. The other components included the production of a machinima (a short film shot\nwithin SL) which showed the highlights of their learning experience, a group document\ndescribing the project overall, including the development process, and an individual docu-\nment grounding the learning experience in the relevant literature, reflecting on the overall\nexperience, providing a critique of their learning experience and engaging in a broader\ndiscussion of the value of IVWs for learning.\nWe hypothesised that engaging young people in the design of learning experiences in\nvirtual environments might lead to innovative solutions. Rather than simply replicating real-\nlife learning situations in SL, we hoped that the Web 2.0 generation would have a freedom\nto push boundaries in ways we might not consider. Similarly, by giving students the tools\nto design learning experiences within SL, we aimed to allow them to tap into their creative\nideas for education, and bring those ideas to fruition in an environment unhampered by the\nlaws and constraints of traditional physical educational spaces.\n3.2. Process\nA total of 41 students took part in the course. At the first course meeting, students were\ngiven a description of the research being carried out, and signed voluntary consent forms.\nStudents then formed project teams (eight in total), were assigned an issue to investigate,\nand invited to an initial meeting with their client (either in person, or using teleconferencing\nfacilities). Following this meeting, groups produced an initial specification for the design of\ntheir learning experience, and were given feedback from each member of the teaching team.\nThe groups then began work on their learning experience, providing weekly updates to the\nteaching team in the form of notecards in SL, which allowed for feedback to be provided on\na regular basis.\nMembers of the staff team were frequently present in SL throughout the course, and\nstudents were told that staff were available for discussion either in real life or SL.\nImpromptu visits were often arranged inworld to view and discuss progress. The final\ncourse session consisted of a presentation of each group\u2019s machinima, and was attended by\nmany of the project mentors, in addition to a number of guests both internal and external to\nthe university.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   167\nWe adopted a high-risk strategy by not only presenting students with real-life problems\nin areas they had little or no knowledge of, but also asking them to develop possible\nsolutions \u2013 learning experiences \u2013 in an environment to which they had had little, if any,\nexposure. In order to mitigate the risks, the project was supported by eight sessions of two\nhours each, where students were introduced to a range of learning theories, initial orienta-\ntion and building classes in SL and mentoring by a staff team experienced in interactive\ntechnologies, learning theory and SL. Sessions were highly interactive, and focused around\ntopics which could potentially be of use in the students\u2019 project work, including the contri-\nbutions of artificial intelligence to education, social software for learning, games and simu-\nlations. Students were assured that projects which tried to make full use of the affordances\nof SL and included a well-thought out reflection on the process, would receive high marks\n(even if not completely implemented).\nAdditionally, by taking a studio-based approach to teaching and learning (where\nstudents regularly discuss their progress with their peers in an open-ended way, and receive\nsupport and guidance from facilitators, both in a real space and in SL), we hoped to emulate\nthe practices of interdisciplinary groups working on creative ideas for the design of learning\nenvironments. \n3.3. Data collection\nA number of different types of data were collected throughout the study. The primary source\nwas the four pieces of assessed student work, described in Section 3.1. Given that both the\ngroup document and the individual document required significant reflection on the students\u2019\nown learning processes, they provided important sources of data on the student perspective.\nFurther sources of data were the weekly notecards completed by the groups in SL, email\ncomments from students, group project workspaces (e.g. wikis, Google groups) and a stan-\ndard online end of course assessment form used across the university, designed to measure\nthe quality of the teaching and learning provision. We also conducted informal interviews\nwith students, both in real life and inworld, and performed observations of project work,\nagain both in real life and inworld, with a particular focus on how the project specification\nchanged over time. Finally, the course team communicated on an almost daily basis to\nassess progress (both our own and that of the students), reflect on overall strategy and make\ndecisions on any necessary interventions (e.g. how to deal with student stuckness).\nAlthough we also gathered feedback from the clients as they attended the final presentation\nand in discussions afterwards, this paper focuses on the learning process within the course\nitself, rather than on the value of the SL learning experiences which the students created.\n4. Theoretical underpinnings\nUnderpinning the practical considerations in the design of the course were theoretical\nconsiderations on the nature of learning, and the best approaches for fostering learning.\nThe ILE course has traditionally been based on a constructivist and constructionist peda-\ngogy. Constructionism (Harel and Papert 1991) maintains, in keeping with constructivist\ntheories, that knowledge is constructed by the learner rather than transmitted from teacher\nto learner. Extending this central tenet, constructionism further argues that knowledge\nconstruction is particularly well supported when learners are engaged in building artefacts\nwhich are personally meaningful. It is also important that the entities created are public, as\nsharing a creation with others requires the learner to explain and talk about what they have\nconstructed, including the process of construction.\n168  J. Good et al.\nThus, course sessions typically involve discussion and debate around readings, design\nexercises, and critiquing of software for learning, rather than lectures. Assessment is\ndesigned to allow for personal choice, is situated in a realistic context, and involves the\ncreation of a tangible entity which can be viewed and commented on by others (e.g. in the\nform of peer reviews), rather than, say, essays.\nHowever, in designing the SL learning experience, we recognised the applicability of a\nPBL approach, both in terms of the overall assessment, and in the content of many of the\nindividual sessions.\nPBL typically involves having students work in teams to explore a problem, with the\ntutor acting as a facilitator to this process. PBL has been used to describe a range of different\nlearning activities, and has been confused with problem-solving learning (Savin-Baden\n2000). At first sight, this project could appear to be the latter. However, the authors would\nargue that although the students were engaged in problem-solving activities, the absence of\na clear or known solution \u2013 and indeed the probability of many possible solutions or\napproaches with no pre-determined expectations from the instructors \u2013 identifies this as\nPBL. Savin-Baden and Major (2004) differentiate PBL from problem-solving learning in\nthe following way: in the latter, the instructor sets a problem which students solve in a\nstepwise logical manner, using resources provided by the instructor. The solution is largely\npre-determined. On the other hand, PBL presents students with a problem, often scenario\nbased, and students work in small self-directed teams to define, carry out and reflect upon\nthe problem task, presenting their own solutions, which may not be those anticipated by the\nteacher. Ideally, there should be a crossing of disciplinary boundaries, although this is often\ndifficult to achieve in practice, particularly when PBL must be implemented \u2018on a shoe-\nstring\u2019, i.e. in a single course, rather than across a curriculum (Savin-Baden and Major\n2004). Originally developed in the medical field, PBL is frequently used in disciplines\nwhere practitioners are faced with problems on a daily basis and learning to work in a team\nis a necessary part of their training.\nPBL is now a recognised approach in a number of subject domains, and the various\nfacets of PBL have been explored in depth, including its defining characteristics (Boud and\nFeletti 1997), categorisation of problem types (Schmidt and Moust 2000) and facilitator\nroles (Wilkerson and Hundert 1997; Savin-Baden 2003). It is a rich discipline taking a\nvariety of different forms. Drawing on the work of Boud (1985) and Barrows (1986), Savin-\nBaden (2000) has offered taxonomies and descriptions of a number of different models of\nPBL, and argues that the form of PBL being used should be made explicit both within the\ncurriculum and to students. The model we adopted was a variation of the problem-based\nmodel in which students meet with a client in some form of simulated format that permits\nfree enquiry (Barrows 1986) combined with PBL for transdisciplinary learning. \nIn this model of problem-based learning, students are encouraged to adopt a critical position\ntowards knowledges, themselves and their peers, and to use the problem-based learning group\nas a place in which to examine and test out personal and pedagogical frameworks. (Savin-\nBaden 2000, 132)\nThe ILE course assessment was a good match in terms of the characteristic features of\nPBL as defined by Boud and Feletti (1997); students began with an open-ended problem in\nthe form of a difficult issue to teach in real life. They formed into teams to tackle the prob-\nlem, and were invited to use a range of resources on learning approaches together with the\naffordances of SL to develop possible interactive learning experiences in SL. The group\nexplored the issue both in and out of class time, with access to the teaching team on an as-\nneeded basis. Once an initial solution was sketched out, students needed to determine the\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   169\nskills and information to be acquired (e.g. subject-specific information from their client,\nbuilding and scripting skills in SL) and define team member responsibilities. Through an\niterative process of development, they then explored ways of addressing the problem\nscenario. Lastly, they self-evaluated their outputs, both individually and as a group.\nInterestingly, our teams had a degree of interdisciplinarity. Although based in a school\nof science and technology, the Master\u2019s programmes from which students were drawn\n(Human-Centred Computing Systems, Intelligent Systems and Multimedia and Virtual\nEnvironments) are conversion courses designed for students from a wide variety of back-\ngrounds. Although more firmly grounded in the computer science field, undergraduate\nstudents were also enrolled on different degree programmes, from straight computer\nscience, to degrees such as Music Informatics, Internet Computing, and combinations of\nsubjects such as Artificial Intelligence and German.\nFinally, the constructionist component of the exercise, which required project teams to\ndesign a learning experience in SL, produced a tangible output to the PBL process, hence\nfacilitating assessment, and allowing us to evaluate the process, the product, and students\u2019\nown assessment of their work.\n5. Unique contribution of Second Life to PBL\nAlthough lauded for providing authentic learning opportunities, PBL also presents chal-\nlenges for educators. It requires that instructors consider a number of issues when deciding\nto adopt it, including methods of assessment (Duch and Groh 2001). A further concern is\nensuring that the problems chosen do not leave students with a narrowed field of experience\nin terms of the curriculum (Ryan 1997). Instructors also need to consider how they can\nmove from a traditional lecturer role to one of facilitator, and how students can adapt to their\nnew roles without experiencing concomitant anxiety as a result of the open-endedness of the\nPBL process (Savin-Baden and Major 2004). Finally, there is a danger that facilitation can\nbe reduced to \u201ca skills-based task that focuses purely on process and ignores the quality of\nwhat students actually produce and feed back to the group\u201d (Savin-Baden 2000, 132).\nA virtual world offers the opportunity to adopt new approaches to PBL. Savin-Baden\n(2007) has argued that there is a need to reinvent PBL as a much more troublesome learning\nspace than is currently the case, and has drawn attention to the possible connection with\nthreshold concepts and troublesome learning as discussed by Meyer and Land (2006). We\nsuggest that the use of an immersive virtual world such as SL in combination with PBL\nallows one to address key issues in meaningful ways, described below.\n5.1 Supporting role of tutors and students\nSL allows the role of the tutor to be \u2018blurred\u2019 in a number of ways. The tutor is unlikely to\nbe an expert on all aspects of SL, in addition to the subject matter in question, and must\ntherefore suggest appropriate ways for the students to gain the knowledge and skills they\nneed. This, in turn, is supported by the extensive online community which exists within SL:\ntutorials, resources, information and support are available from a wide variety of sources,\nand students are likely to consult others inworld for help and guidance. Embedding the\nlearning in the wider community in this way provides a concrete model of the collaborative\nnature of learning and problem solving.\nSL facilitates the provision of ongoing feedback to students. Students are aware of when\ntheir tutors are inworld, and we found our students very keen to teleport us to their location\nin SL in order to demonstrate their work and obtain feedback.\n170  J. Good et al.\nThere are also more subtle changes in the relationship between tutors and students which\narise from modes of communication and self-presentation inworld. For students, chatting\nwith the instructor\u2019s avatar was a very different experience to speaking with one\u2019s instructor\nin real life, and a number of informal and wide-ranging conversations ensued between\nstudents and members of the teaching team which are unlikely to have occurred in real life.\nAgain, we feel that this reinforced the role of the instructor as a source of guidance and, in\nsome cases, a peer rather than an authority.\n5.2 Motivation and relevance\nCreating an entity in a virtual world such as SL, which is often commented on in the press,\nensures that the project has high relevance to students. It is a new and exciting area in which\nto be working, and most students are likely to see the ability to create artefacts in an online\nvirtual world as a powerful skill. One student remarked on the course evaluation question-\nnaire: \u201cIt has opened new doors to an entirely different field of computing, which is very\ninteresting, and the course has made me realize that there is so much potential out there to\ndo anything you can think of!\u201d SL supported our constructionist approach well, ensuring\nthat students develop knowledge and skills through the creation of a public entity which has\nmeaning and significance for them and for others. Another student, commenting on the final\npresentation in an email to the instructors, remarked that, \u201cIt was good to see so many\nprominent people in the department, as well as students and staff not on the course taking\nsuch an interest in our work\u201d.\n5.3 Problematic problems\nThe cutting-edge nature of the environment ensures that there are no simple answers to\nproblems set. Whilst most real-world problems have been attempted in some form, SL is\nstill a relatively new environment. In tackling the problems devised by our clients, students\nwere obliged to develop their own solutions, as there were no examples of existing solutions\nto which they could refer in SL. Although they could make use of previously solved low\ngranularity problems, such as creating a chat-bot, they needed to build new components and\ncombine existing ones in novel ways.\nOne of the more difficult aspects of the project for us as instructors was knowing what\nthe students were actually doing. Initially there was a deathly silence when we wondered\nif anything was happening at all. This was accompanied by the flight into activity of one\ngroup which began to build an enormous edifice containing classrooms. Our presupposi-\ntion that students would have less baggage than their instructors was called into question;\nit appeared that though the students might have less baggage, they also had less experi-\nence of education other than that delivered in formal settings, and they escaped to the\nfamiliar surroundings of building lecture theatres. This reflects Savin-Baden\u2019s (2007)\nobservation of the stuckness that can occur in the learning process and her identification\nof a number of possible responses, including an avoidance of the task and a retreat to the\nfamiliar.\nHowever, as the course progressed and students became more confident in the SL envi-\nronment, a number of the groups moved away from the large formal builds into doing things\nonly possible in a virtual environment, such as creating a magic forest where works of art\nhung from the branches of trees, or building a large retail outlet and superimposing a layer\n\u2013 only visible by flying above the building \u2013 of systems diagrams relating to the operation\nof the store. The students had moved beyond their stuckness to a position where they had\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   171\nnot only mastered a new environment, but had used it to create new and inventive learning\npossibilities.\n5.4 Flexibility\nSL provides good support for setting open-ended problems for students. In the real world,\nlimiting factors can mean that attempts to set open-ended problems are foiled by practical-\nities such as the availability of resources, or constraints on scale. In SL, although activities\nare not constraint-free, there is a much greater range of possible solutions and directions in\nwhich students can choose to take problems. The flexibility of SL also makes it possible for\na problem to be simplified in the early stages of a PBL project process by removing factors\nwhich would need to be addressed in real life, for example, by providing ready-made scripts\nor objects for users to work with to allow them to focus on a specific area of a problem.\n5.5 Ownership\nThe freedom from real-world limiting factors allows students to take greater ownership of\ntheir project, as there is less need for them to check or consult with someone in a position\nof authority. Although there are risks in SL, it offers a safe environment for experimenta-\ntion. This can enhance the sense of responsibility groups feel for their work. The strength\nof the online community surrounding SL can further support student independence. Online\nforums, weblogs, wikis and other sites are available which can provide answers to almost\nany question a student may have about how to achieve something inworld. This empowers\nthe students further as they can quickly identify areas in which their knowledge is lacking\nand set about developing the skills required by doing their own research.\n5.6 Ease of assessment\nWork carried out in SL is easily viewed and appreciated. Entities created can be explored\nby tutors at various stages of the PBL process. Additionally, creating machinima provided\nan ideal way for the student groups to reflect on their problem solutions and a convenient\nway for tutors to gain an insight into the artefacts created. Nonetheless, it is worth noting\nthat if students are creating entities in SL, especially when they are large and complex, there\nmay well be issues around submitting them for assessment (for example, land may need to\nbe rented on which to house the entities, or if they are submitted by placing them in the\ninstructor\u2019s inventory, there may be issues around how to rebuild them, etc.).\n6. Conclusion\nAs described above, the process of combining PBL and constructionism with problems\nwhich spanned the real world and a virtual world brought with it a number of advantages.\nOverall, student feedback was very positive, which is heartening, considering the potential\nfor anxiety associated with tackling open-ended, real-world problems in an unfamiliar envi-\nronment.\nAt the same time, there is potential for improvement, although we would argue that\nmany of the problems we encountered were less to do with the combination of PBL and SL,\nthan with our own implementation of PBL. For example, although we felt that we had\naddressed the issue of group versus individual responsibility via the individual reflective\n172  J. Good et al.\ncomponent, in retrospect we realised that we had not implemented individual accountability\nin the design of the SL learning experience, with the result that some team members were\nmuch less active and engaged than they might have been. Similarly, we did not provide\nexplicit support for the acquisition of team skills. We plan to address both of these issues in\nthe next academic year.\nNonetheless, the combination of PBL with SL provided a number of distinct advantages,\noffering an ideal venue in which to exercise authentic problem-based learning, reinforcing\nthe facilitative role of the instructors, whilst offering motivation and relevance for the\nstudents. Overall, immersive virtual worlds offer an exciting opportunity to both consolidate\nexisting pedagogical practices and extend them in new ways.\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to Diane Brewster for initial discussions on problem-based learning, and to our students, for\ntheir creativity and enthusiasm.
