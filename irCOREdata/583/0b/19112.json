(Blood. 2010;\n115(14):2938-2946)\nIntroduction\nDectin-1, C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2), and CLEC-9A\nare C-type lectin receptors which have been shown to sig-\nnal through an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif\n(ITAM)\u2013like pathway via a single YxxL in their short cytoplasmic tails\nknown as a hemITAM.1-4 Tyrosine phosphorylation of the conserved\ntyrosine and both SH2 domains of the tyrosine kinase Syk have been\nshown to be essential for activation of Syk by CLEC-2 and dectin-1,\nfavoring a model in which the tyrosine kinase is activated by the\ncross-linking of 2 receptors.2 This is consistent with the observations\nthat CLEC-9A is a disulphide-linked dimer and that CLEC-2 is\nexpressed as a noncovalent dimer.1,5\nCLEC-2 is highly expressed in platelets and at lower levels in\nother hematopoietic cells, including neutrophils and dendritic\ncells.6,7 It is a type II transmembrane protein and a nonclassical\nC-type lectin that lacks the conserved amino acids that mediate\nbinding to glycans.7 CLEC-2 was identified by affinity chromatog-\nraphy as a ligand for the snake venom protein rhodocytin, purified\nfrom the Malayan pit viper, Calloselasma rhodostoma.3 Indepen-\ndent crystal structures of rhodocytin show that it assembles as a\ntetramer, which leads to the suggestion that it mediates activation\nof CLEC-2 through clustering.8,9 Consistent with this clustering\nmodel of activation, whole antibodies and F(ab)2 fragments have\nbeen reported to activate CLEC-2, whereas antibody Fab fragments\nwere inhibitory.3,10,11\nPhysiologic roles of CLEC-2 are now beginning to emerge.\nRecently, CLEC-2 has been implicated in tumor metastasis via its\ninteraction with the type I sialoglycoprotein podoplanin, which is\nalso expressed on the surface of kidney podocytes, lung type I\nalveolar cells, and lymphatic endothelium.12-14 CLEC-2 has also\nbeen shown to play a role in neutrophil phagocytosis.15 Evidence\nobtained using antibody depletion of CLEC-2 from mouse platelets\nhas shown that it plays an important role in hemostasis and\nthrombosis at arteriolar rates of flow.11\nStudies on platelets and mutant cell lines have demonstrated\nthat CLEC-2 and the other hemITAM receptors share many of the\nsignaling features of receptors that signal via ITAMs. The ITAM\nmotif is defined by the sequence YxxLx6-12YxxL, and is found in\nreceptors such as the T-cell receptor and the platelet collagen\nreceptor, GPVI-FcR\u0001-chain.16 The characteristic ITAM signaling\nfeatures include sequential activation of Src and Syk family\nkinases, adapter proteins such as LAT, SLP-76, and BLNK, and\nactivation of PLC\u00012.2,3,17 Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that\nthe proximal events in the CLEC-2 signaling cascade are distinct\nfrom that for ITAM receptors in that phosphorylation of the\nhemITAM is mediated by both Src and Syk tyrosine kinases,\nwhereas phosphorylation of the ITAM is mediated solely by Src\nkinases.10\nITAM receptors signal through cholesterol-rich lipid membrane\ndomains, known as lipid rafts or GEMS.18-20 These specialized\nregions of the membrane are enriched in many signaling proteins,\nincluding Src family kinases and the membrane adapter protein\nLAT.21 In addition, the cytoskeleton plays a contributory, but\npoorly understood role in signaling by ITAM receptors.22 Recently,\ndectin-1 has also been shown to signal in lipid rafts,23 but it is not\nknown if this is also the case for CLEC-2.\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the role of lipid\nrafts and the actin cytoskeleton in platelet activation by CLEC-2\nalongside that of GPVI to investigate whether this could explain the\ndifferential reliance of the 2 receptors on Src and Syk kinases in\nmediating hemITAM and ITAM phosphorylation.\nSubmitted December 3, 2009; accepted January 12, 2010.

Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\u2013conjugated\nanti\u2013mouse and anti\u2013rabbit IgGs were obtained from GE Healthcare, and\nHRP-conjugated anti\u2013rat IgG was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnol-\nogy. EHT 1864 was obtained from ExonHit Therapeutics, and Cangrelor, a\nP2Y12 inhibitor, was obtained from The Medicines Company. Eptifibatide\nwas obtained from the University Hospital Birmingham\u2019s pharmacy. All\nother reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\nPreparation of human platelets\nVenous blood from healthy drug-free volunteers was taken into 10%\nsodium citrate, and washed platelets were prepared as previously de-\nscribed.2 They were resuspended in a modified HEPES Tyrode buffer\n(composition: 134mM NaCl, 2.9mM KCl, 0.34mM Na2PO4.12H2O, 12mM\nNaHCO3, 20mM HEPES, 1mM MgCl2, and 5mM glucose [pH 7.3]).\nPlatelet aggregation\nAggregation was monitored by light transmission using a Born lumi-\naggregometer (Chronolog).\nM\u0001CD treatment\nFor cholesterol depletion, washed platelets were incubated with 5mM,\n2.5mM, or 1mM methyl-\u0003-cyclodextrin (M\u0003CD) for 1 hour at room\ntemperature before stimulation.\nLipid raft isolation\nFor membrane preparation, cells (0.5 mL at 1.5 \u0004 109 platelets\/mL) were\ndisrupted in ice-cold lysis buffer (25mM Tris-HCL [pH 7.6], 150mM NaCl,\n5mM EDTA, 1% Brij 58, 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF],\n2mM sodium orthovanadate [Na3VO4], 10 \u0005g\/mL leupeptin, 10 \u0005g\/mL\naprotinin, and 1 \u0005g\/mL pepstatin A). The same buffer was used for the\nsucrose gradient solutions. The lysate was mixed with an equal volume of\n80% (wt\/vol) sucrose, producing a final concentration of 40%. The lysate\nwas loaded on the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with 2 mL\nof 30% (wt\/vol) sucrose followed by 1 mL of 5% (wt\/vol) sucrose. Lipid\nrafts were separated from nonraft and cytoskeleton components by ultracen-\ntrifugation (48 000g for 16 hours). After fraction isolation, 1% (wt\/vol)\nN-dodecyl-\u0003-D-gluco-maltoside was added to solubilize the lipid rafts.\nFractions were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel\nelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).\nImmunoprecipitation studies\nWashed resting or stimulated platelets (1.5 \u0004 108), pretreated with 9\u0005M\neptifibatide to inhibit platelet activation and aggregation through integrin\n\u0002IIb\u00033, were lysed with an equal volume of 2 \u0004 lysis buffer (20mM\nTris\/HCL [pH 7.5], 300mM NaCl, 2mM EGTA, 2mM EDTA, 2% NP-40,\n2mM PMSF, 5mM Na3VO4, 10 \u0005g\/mL leupeptin, 10 \u0005g\/mL aprotinin, and\n1 \u0005g\/mL pepstatin). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15 000g\nfor 10 minutes). After preclearing, proteins were captured by antibodies\nbound to either protein G\u2013sepharose or protein A\u2013sepharose. Samples were\nseparated on a SDS-PAGE along side a molecular weight marker and\ntransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. After\nblocking, the membranes were incubated with primary antibody overnight,\nwashed, and then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for\n1 hour. Immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by chemilumines-\ncence (ECL; Pierce).\nRac pull-down assay\nEptifibatide-treated platelets were lysed with 2\u0004 lysis buffer (100mM\nTris-HCL [pH 7.5], 1M NaCl, 20mM MgCl2, 1% deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS,\n2% Triton X-100, 2mM PMSF, 10 \u0005g\/mL leupeptin, 20 \u0005g\/mL aprotinin,\nand 5mM EGTA). Lysates were centrifuged at 18 000g at 4\u00b0C for\n10 minutes. Equal volumes of lysates were incubated with glutathione-S-\ntransferase\u2013PAK bound to glutathione-sepharose beads for 30 minutes at\n4\u00b0C. The beads were washed 3 times with wash buffer (50mM Tris-HCL\n[pH 7.5], 150mM NaCl, 10mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1mM PMSF,\n10 \u0005g\/mL leupeptin, 5 \u0005g\/mL aprotinin, and 5mM EGTA). The Rac1\nproteins bound to the beads were detected by Western blotting using\nanti-Rac1 antibodies.\nGeneration of podoplanin-expressing CHO cells\nChinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with pcDNA3\ncontaining full-length human podoplanin using a calcium phosphate\ntransfection method. Stable transfectants were obtained using media\ncontaining 1 mg\/mL geneticin (G418) and clonal cell populations obtained\nafter serial dilutions into 96-well plates. Surface expression of human\npodoplanin was assessed by flow cytometry.\nResults\nCLEC-2 localizes to lipid rafts upon stimulation with rhodocytin\nLipid rafts are plasma microdomains which have been shown to\nplay an important role in signaling by ITAM receptors. To assess\nthe role of these specialized membrane regions in signaling by\nCLEC-2, we measured the presence of CLEC-2 in lipid rafts under\nresting and stimulated conditions. Brij 58 has previously been\nshown to preserve lipid rafts over a wide range of concentrations\nand was selected as the detergent of choice in this study.26 Brij\n58-solubilized platelet lysates were separated into lipid raft frac-\ntions and nonraft fractions by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation\nand analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The presence of CLEC-2, which runs\nas a doublet due to differential glycosylation,3 was investigated by\nWestern blotting using a specific antibody. In control, nonstimu-\nlated platelets, approximately 5% of CLEC-2 was found in the\ndetergent-insoluble fraction (Figure 1A-B). The detergent-\ninsoluble fraction was enriched in the lipid raft marker protein LAT\nbut excluded the nonraft marker, the integrin \u0002IIb subunit.26\nStimulation of platelets by rhodocytin caused an approximate 35%\nredistribution of CLEC-2 to the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig-\nure 1A-B) raising the possibility that it signals through these\nlipid-rich membrane domains. To investigate this further, we\nmonitored tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2 after immunopre-\ncipitation from lipid raft and nonraft fractions of rhodocytin-\nstimulated platelets (Figure 1C). Approximately 90% of tyrosine-\nphosphorylated CLEC-2 was found within the insoluble, lipid raft\nmembrane domain consistent with a model in which signaling by\nthe lectin receptor takes place in the cholesterol-rich membrane\ndomains.\nAs CLEC-2 phosphorylation by Src and Syk family kinases is\ncritical for platelet activation, we investigated whether movement\nof CLEC-2 to the lipid raft fraction was blocked by pretreatment of\nplatelets with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2. Incubation of platelets\nwith PP2 completely inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2\n(data not shown), in confirmation of previous publications,3,10 but\nMECHANISM OF CLEC-2 PHOSPHORYLATION 2939BLOOD, 8 APRIL 2010 \u0001 VOLUME 115, NUMBER 14\nhad no effect on its movement to the lipid raft fraction (supplemen-\ntal Figure 1, available on the Blood website; see the Supplemental\nMaterials link at the top of the online article), demonstrating that\ntranslocation occurs before tyrosine phosphorylation.\nThe cholesterol-lowering agent M\u0003CD was used to further\ninvestigate the role of lipid rafts in rhodocytin signaling. In\nagreement with previous reports,27,28 we found that pretreatment of\nplatelets with a relatively high concentration (5mM) of M\u0003CD\ncaused mild (\u0006 20%) inhibition of thrombin induced aggregation,\nwhereas there was no effect at lower M\u0003CD concentrations (Figure\n2A). In contrast, M\u0003CD caused a marked, concentration-dependent\ninhibition of rhodocytin-induced aggregation that reduced the\nresponse by greater than 95% at 5mM, with a partial effect\nobserved at lower concentrations (1-2mM). Consistent with this,\nboth whole-cell tyrosine phosphorylation and CLEC-2 tyrosine\nphosphorylation by rhodocytin were inhibited by M\u0003CD in a\nconcentration-dependent manner (data not shown; Figure 2B).\nTogether, these data demonstrate a critical role for lipid rafts in\nsignaling by the snake venom toxin and support a model in which\ntranslocation to the raft fractions occurs before phosphorylation of\nthe hemITAM receptor.\nCytochalasin D inhibits rhodocytin signaling\nThe actin cytoskeleton plays a contributory but poorly defined\nrole in signaling by ITAM receptors. We therefore used cytocha-\nlasin D, a powerful inhibitor of actin polymerization, to\ninvestigate the role of actin polymerization in the movement of\nCLEC-2 to lipid rafts and platelet activation by rhodocytin.\nFigure 1. CLEC-2 translocates to lipid rafts upon stimulation.\n(A) Resting and rhodocytin-stimulated platelets were lysed in the\npresence of 1% Brij 58 and separated into lipid raft and nonraft\nfractions by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The localization\nof CLEC-2 was determined by immunoblotting with specific\nantibodies. The lipid raft fractions were identified using an anti-\nLAT blot, and nonraft fractions were identified using an anti\u2013\nintegrin \u0002IIb blot. (B) Characterization of fractions from basal and\nrhodocytin stimulated platelets pretreated with DMSO or 10\u0005M\ncytochalasin D. Data represent the mean and standard error of\n3 independent experiments. (C) CLEC-2 was immunoprecipitated\nfrom lipid raft and nonraft fractions of platelets stimulated with\n100nM rhodocytin and blotted with an antiphosphotyrosine anti-\nbody. Membranes were subsequently stripped and reblotted with\nanti\u2013CLEC-2. Data are representative of at least 3 independent\nexperiments.\nFigure 2.

(Right) The percentage of transmittance of\nplatelets pretreated with decreasing concentrations of\nM\u0003CD-treated platelets stimulated with rhodocytin or\nthrombin was measured after 5 minutes.

Data are representative of 3 indepen-\ndent experiments.\n2940 POLLITT et al BLOOD, 8 APRIL 2010 \u0001 VOLUME 115, NUMBER 14\nCytochalasin D (10\u0005M) had no effect on the translocation of\nCLEC-2 to lipid rafts (Figure 1B; supplemental Figure 1), but\ncompletely abrogated tyrosine phosphorylation of the lectin\nreceptor, demonstrating a pivotal role for actin polymerization\nin the early events underlying receptor signaling. Consistent\nwith this, whole-cell tyrosine phosphorylation, including ty-\nrosine phosphorylation of Syk and PLC\u00012, were completely\ninhibited in the presence of a maximally effective (10\u0005M)\nconcentration of cytochalasin D (Figure 3A-B). Furthermore,\ncytochalasin D (10\u0005M) blocked aggregation to low concentra-\ntions of rhodocytin and inhibited the response to higher\nconcentrations of the snake venom by more than 70%, while a\nsubmaximal concentration of cytochalasin D (1\u0005M) caused a\nmarked increase in the lag phase that precedes aggregation\n(Figure 3C-D). In contrast, a maximal concentration of cytocha-\nlasin D (10\u0005M) had no significant effect on tyrosine phosphory-\nlation of Syk and PLC\u00012 induced by the GPVI-specific agonists\ncollagen-related peptide (CRP) and convulxin (Figure 3A-B),\nand caused only a marginal decrease in the rate of late-stage\naggregation with no effect on the maximal response (Figure\n3C-D). Comparable observations for both rhodocytin- and\nGPVI-mediated responses were seen with a second inhibitor of\nactin polymerization, latrunculin A (data not shown). These\nresults therefore demonstrate a critical role for actin polymeriza-\ntion in platelet activation by rhodocytin.\nRole of secondary mediators in rhodocytin signaling\nThe secondary mediators ADP and TxA2 play a critical positive\nfeedback role in mediating platelet activation by all agonists,\nalthough for many their action is obviated at high agonist concen-\ntrations.29 To investigate the dependency on secondary mediators\nFigure 3. Platelet responses to rhodocytin are impaired upon cytochalasin D treatment. (A) Whole-cell lysates from basal or agonist-stimulated platelets preincubated\nwith various doses of cytochalasin D were separated by SDS-PAGE, and tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed using an antiphosphotyrosine antibody. (B) Whole-cell lysates\nwere isolated from resting or platelets stimulated with (i) rhodocytin, (ii) CRP, or (iii) convulxin, treated with or without cytochalasin D. CLEC-2, PLC\u00012, and Syk were\nimmunoprecipitated and the samples separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for CLEC-2, PLC\u00012, and Syk. Their tyrosine-phosphorylated states were assessed using\nan antiphosphotyrosine antibody. (C) Platelets pretreated with various concentrations of cytochalasin D were stimulated with (i) 30nM rhodocytin, (ii) 3 \u0005g\/mL CRP, and\n(iii) 1 \u0005g\/mL convulxin.

Platelets pretreated with DMSO or 10\u0005M cytochalasin D are shown as mean and standard error of 3 independent\nexperiments.\nMECHANISM OF CLEC-2 PHOSPHORYLATION 2941BLOOD, 8 APRIL 2010 \u0001 VOLUME 115, NUMBER 14\nfor platelet activation by rhodocytin, we used the ADP scavenger,\napyrase, and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. Strik-\ningly, the combination of apyrase and indomethacin abolished\nplatelet aggregation to a 30-nM concentration of rhodocytin\n(Figure 4Ai). The inhibition seen in the presence of secondary\nmediators could not be overcome with higher concentrations of\nrhodocytin (Figure 4Aii). Strikingly, however, the movement of\nCLEC-2 into lipid rafts induced by rhodocytin was not altered in\nthe presence of the 2 inhibitors (supplemental Figure 1). The\nincrease in whole-cell tyrosine phosphorylation induced by rhodo-\ncytin (100nM) and phosphorylation of CLEC-2 was also dramati-\ncally reduced in the presence of apyrase and indomethacin (Figure\n4B; data not shown). The residual increase in tyrosine phosphoryla-\ntion induced by rhodocytin in the presence of apyrase and\nindomethacin was inhibited in the presence of PP2 or cytochalasin\nD (Figure 4B).\nAs the presence of secondary mediators lead to a substantial\namplification in CLEC-2 tyrosine phosphorylation we assessed the\neffect of ADP and a TxA2 mimetic (U46619) on CLEC-2 phosphor-\nylation. ADP and U46619 had no significant effect on CLEC-2\nphosphorylation (Figure 4C). Thus, the role of secondary mediators\nin regulating CLEC-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream\nsignaling is indirect. We further assessed the effect ADP and\nU46619 had on rhodocytin-mediated CLEC-2 phosphorylation\nafter inhibition of actin polymerization. We found that the 2 second-\nary mediators were able to partially restore phosphorylation of\nCLEC-2 in the presence of cytochalasin D (Figure 4E) demonstrat-\ning that actin polymerization lies upstream of secondary mediator\ngeneration and further CLEC-2 phosphorylation.\nFurther studies were designed to investigate whether the effect\nof apyrase and indomethacin was due to blockade of the P2Y1,\nP2Y12, or TxA2 receptors, or a combination of these effects (Figure\n4Aiii,D). The antagonists MRS2179 and Cangrelor are selective to\nP2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors, respectively, and indomethacin prevents\nthe formation of TxA2 by blocking cyclooxygenase. Inhibition of\nthe P2Y1 receptor had no effect on rhodocytin-induced platelet\naggregation or CLEC-2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of the P2Y12\nreceptor caused a slight inhibition in rhodocytin-induced aggrega-\ntion and CLEC-2 phosphorylation. In contrast, the greatest inhibi-\ntion in rhodocytin-induced aggregation was seen when TxA2\nformation was inhibited. This also resulted in a near loss in\nCLEC-2 phosphorylation. These data suggest that the major\nfeedback mechanism that leads to an increase in CLEC-2 phosphor-\nylation is downstream of the TxA2 receptor, but that there is limited\nsynergy with signaling downstream of the P2Y12 and P2Y1\nreceptors, as a combination of apyrase and indomethacin further\nreduces CLEC-2 phosphorylation.\nFigure 4.

(E) CLEC-2 was\nimmunoprecipitated from rhodocytin-stimulated platelets pretreated with the indicated inhibitors with or without the addition of ADP\/U46619, and tyrosine phosphorylation was\nassessed. Data shown are representative of 3 independent experiments.\n2942 POLLITT et al BLOOD, 8 APRIL 2010 \u0001 VOLUME 115, NUMBER 14\nCLEC-2 phosphorylation requires Rac1\nStudies on platelets from Rac1-deficient mice have shown that\nRac1, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, plays a\ncritical role in mediating PLC\u00012 activation by GPVI in platelets\nleading to inhibition of Ca2\u0007 mobilization.30,31 Consistent with this,\nwe observed concentration-dependent inhibition of Rac activation\nand aggregation of human platelets in response to CRP in the\npresence of the novel and selective Rac1 inhibitor, EHT 186432\n(Figure 5Ai-ii). This demonstrates that Rac1 also plays a similar\nrole in GPVI signaling in human platelets.\nTo investigate a possible role of Rac1 in rhodocytin-signaling in\nhuman platelets, we first monitored Rac activation using a GST-\nPAK1\u2013binding assay that selectively precipitates GTP-bound Rac.31\nFormation of GTP-bound Rac after stimulation by rhodocytin was\ndetected at 30 seconds and peaked at 45 seconds before declining\nto a plateau (Figure 5B). The delay in activation corresponds to the\ncharacteristic lag seen for rhodocytin-induced platelet aggregation\n(data not shown). Activation of Rac1 by rhodocytin was inhibited\nin the presence of cytochalasin D and apyrase\/indomethacin,\nsuggesting that it may lie downstream of actin polymerization or\nsecond messenger generation (data not shown).\nThe Rac1 inhibitor, EHT 1864, completely inhibited formation\nof GTP-bound Rac1 by rhodocytin at 50\u0005M and caused partial\ninhibition at 10\u0005M (Figure 5C), with a similar concentration-\nresponse relationship for inhibition of aggregation (Figure 5Di).\nEHT 1864 also markedly inhibited whole-cell tyrosine phosphory-\nlation (data not shown) and phosphorylation of CLEC-2 (Figure\n5Dii) over the same concentration range. The residual increase in\nwhole-cell tyrosine phosphorylation observed in the presence of\nEHT 1864 was retained in the presence of apyrase and indometha-\ncin (Figure 4B). On the other hand, the inhibition of phosphoryla-\ntion of CLEC-2 by rhodocytin in the presence of EHT 1864\nwas only weakly restored in the presence of U46619 and ADP\n(Figure 4E). These results therefore support a model in which\nrhodocytin stimulates weak tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2\nand whole-cell phosphorylation independent of Rac1, but that\nactivation of the GTPase, most likely by ADP and TxA2, is required\nfor robust tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2 and whole-cell\nphosphorylation.\nPodplanin-induced aggregation signals in a similar way to\nrhodocytin\nPodoplanin-expressing but not mock-transfected CHO cells have\npreviously been shown to induce platelet aggregation.13 CHO cells\nthat stably express human podoplanin (hPodoCHO) were gener-\nated, and surface expression of human podoplanin was assessed by\nflow cytometry (Figure 6A). The addition of hPodoCHO cells to\nplatelets induces a similar pattern of aggregation to that seen with\nrhodocytin in that it is preceded by a characteristic lag phase\n(Figure 6B). Pretreatment of platelets with the lipid raft\u2013disrupting\nagent M\u0003CD, the actin-disrupting drug cytochalasin D, inhibitors\nof secondary mediators, or the Rac inhibitor EHT1864 all inhibited\nplatelet aggregation in response to hPodoCHO. These results\ntherefore demonstrate a similar profile of platelet activation by the\nendogenous ligand podoplanin to that induced by rhodocytin.\nDiscussion\nThe present data support a model in which rhodocytin-mediated\nplatelet activation occurs in membrane rafts through activation of\nSrc and Syk family kinases and actin polymerization, and is\nreinforced by the release of the secondary mediators, ADP and\nTxA2, and Rac activation. The following observations form the\nbasis of the model shown in Figure 7: (1) CLEC-2 translocates to\nFigure 5. Role of Rac1 in rhodocytin-induced aggre-\ngation and signaling.

This targets\nthem to specialized cholesterol-rich membrane domains, which are\nalso enriched with many other signaling proteins.33,34 This includes\nthe membrane adapter LAT, which has previously been shown to\nmediate platelet activation by CLEC-2.3,17 Furthermore, signaling\nby ITAM receptors in platelets and in other cells is known to occur\nin lipid rafts, as illustrated by studies on the platelet ITAM\nreceptors GPVI and Fc\u0001RIIA.19,26,35,36 The ITAM-like receptor,\ndectin-1, another hemITAM-containing receptor, has also been\nshown to be recruited to lipid rafts upon activation.23 Thus, it would\nappear that lipid rafts play a critical role in supporting cell\nactivation by both ITAM- and hemITAM-containing receptors.\nIt can be speculated that clustering of CLEC-2 by rhodocytin,\nwhich is a tetramer, causes movement into the cholesterol-enriched\nmembrane domains. The molecular basis of this movement is\nunclear, although the present study has shown that this is indepen-\ndent of actin polymerization. Within the lipid raft environment,\nCLEC-2 becomes phosphorylated through a pathway that is\ndependent on actin polymerization, although this can be bypassed\nby the addition of ADP and U46619 to mimic secondary mediator\nformation. It is this step that contrasts markedly with signaling by\nITAM receptors, as phosphorylation of Syk and PLC\u00012 is not\ndependent on actin polymerization. The critical role of actin\npolymerization in the proximal events in the CLEC-2 signaling\ncascade could be explained by the retention or presentation of key\nsignaling molecules in the vicinity of the C-type lectin receptor\nsuch as Src or Syk kinases. Actin polymerization, however, does\nnot appear to be required for dimerization\/oligomerization of\nCLEC-2 as shown using the cross-linking reagent Sulfo-EGS\n(supplemental Figure 2). Further, dimerization\/oligomerization of\nCLEC-2 is also observed in the presence of apyrase and\nindomethacin.\nIn contrast to the complete inhibition of CLEC-2 tyrosine\nphosphorylation seen in the presence of Src kinase or actin\npolymerization inhibitors, a residual level of phosphorylation is\nseen in the presence of apyrase\/indomethacin or Rac1 inhibi-\ntion. The ability of ADP and the TxA2 mimetic U46619 to\npartially rescue CLEC-2 phosphorylation of platelets treated\nwith cytochalasin D but not the Rac1 inhibitor EHT1864\nsupports this hypothesis. This suggests a role for the secondary\nmediators and Rac activation in amplification of an initial\nreceptor signal and is consistent with the ability of ADP and the\nTxA2 mimetic U46619 to partially rescue CLEC-2 phosphoryla-\ntion of platelets treated with cytochalasin D but not the Rac1\ninhibitor EHT1864. The molecular basis of the action of Rac in\nsupporting signaling by CLEC-2 is unclear, although a number\nof possibilities can be put forward. Rac1 has been shown to\nsupport activation of PLC\u00012 through a direct interaction at the\nlevel of the split PH domain in the lipase.37,38 Rac1 also\nFigure 6. Signaling via podoplanin displays strong similarities to rhodocytin. (A) The level of surface expression of CHO cells stably expressing human podoplanin\n(hPodoCHO) was confirmed by flow cytometry using the anti-podoplanin antibody NZ-1 (infill: CHO cells; overlay: hPodoCHO cells). (B) Human washed platelets (6 \u0004 108\/mL)\npretreated with the indicated inhibitors were stimulated by 4 \u0004 106\/mL hPodoCHO cells, and platelet aggregation was monitored by aggregometry. Data are representative of\n3 independent experiments.\nFigure 7. Model for CLEC-2 signaling. Our observations support the following\nmodel: (1) CLEC-2 translocates to lipid rafts independently of Src kinases, actin\npolymerization and release of ADP and TxA2; (2) Src kinase phosphorylation of\nCLEC-2 occurs in lipids rafts; (3) CLEC-2 tyrosine phosphorylation is dependent on\nactin polymerization; (4) tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2 and downstream\nsignaling events are reinforced by generation of the second mediators ADP and TxA2,\nwhich in turn activate Rac.\n2944 POLLITT et al BLOOD, 8 APRIL 2010 \u0001 VOLUME 115, NUMBER 14\nregulates a number of other targets, including phosphatidylinosi-\ntol 5-kinase,39 which generates the PLC\u00012 substrate, phosphati-\ndylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Rac also regulates actin polymer-\nization and remodeling, although the observation that ADP and\nTxA2 can overcome the inhibitory effect of cytochalasin D\nargues against this playing a major role downstream of Rac.\nThe present results report a unique series of proximal events\nthat underlie phosphorylation of CLEC-2 by rhodocytin and\nplatelet activation. Phosphorylation of CLEC-2 requires actin\npolymerization and is reinforced by release of secondary\nmediators and activation of Rac. This feedback pathway has\nsignificant implications for our recent observation that the\nselective inhibitor of Syk kinase, R406, abrogates phosphoryla-\ntion of CLEC-2 by rhodocytin but has no effect on phosphoryla-\ntion on the FcR\u0001-chain ITAM.10 Although these results are\nconsistent with a model in which Syk mediates phosphorylation\nof the CLEC-2 hemITAM, with the role of Src kinases to\nmediate activation of Syk, they could also be explained by the\nloss of the feedback pathway mediated through actin polymeriza-\ntion and generation of secondary mediators.\nIn summary, we describe a novel feedback pathway that leads to\nsignal amplification of the hemITAM-containing receptor CLEC-2.\nThis mechanism is critically dependent on actin polymerization,\nsecondary mediators, and Rac1 activation.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Craig Hughes for useful discussions.\nThis work was supported by the British Heart Foundation\n(BHF; PG\/07\/116) and the DFG (grant SFB\/TR23 project A8 of\nJ.A.E.).
