What questions should such an approach \npropose? What this special issue contributes to the study of racism is a focus on disruption, \nresistance and transformative practices. While social psychology has often preferred \napproaches that account for the expression of racism (whether this is located in individual \nminds, social institutions or cultural practices) and\/or the psychological consequences of \nracism (on attitudes, stereotypes, representations, identities and self-esteem)\n1\n, we have \nchosen empirical projects and theoretical discussions that focus on the moments in which \nracist and racialising practices are made visible, unsettled and so disrupted. This invites \nanalysis into the opportunities for transgressing racialised networks of power, the social \npsychological dynamics of resistance and so the possibilities for challenging racism and \nsocial change.  Hence what is valuable about these papers is that they begin a discussion of \nhow we may find ways to contest and so undermine racism \u2013 and what subject positions \nthere are available in different social contexts for this endeavour.\n2\n \n \n                                                          \n1\n As Leach (2002) has pointed out, much classical social psychology views racist activity as \u201ca function of \nweak personality, biased perception or ethnocentric categorization\u2026.[ultimately locating] prejudice in the \nindividuated person rather than in societal practices and institutions\u201d (p. 440). \n2\n This is not to propose that the dynamics of racism and strategies of disruption are in any way complete, \nuniform or universal across culture and history. We regret that the range of contexts discussed in the special \nissue is not broader in terms of illustrating how \u201erace\u201f, racism and resistance are always produced in specific \ncultural and historical locations. Three of the five papers here interrogate the associated colonial contexts of \nAotearoa\/New Zealand and Australia. These were chosen as they speak to the issues that we see as crucial in \nthe analysis of racism: \u201ewhiteness\u201f, subjectivity, embodiment and resistance.  \n \n 2 \nThis special issue as a whole makes a very significant argument: that a critical social \npsychology of racism (and \u201ewhiteness\u201f3) needs to consider the social and psychological \npossibilities and conditions for disrupting racialising practices and claims to privilege, \nbelonging and knowing. This argument is worked out in the papers through a series of \nimplicit questions: \n- How should we understand racism: both in day-to-day and institutionalised \nenvironments? \n- How do our own subjectivities shape the ways in which we research racism and assert \n\u201eanti-racist\u201f objectives?  \n- Should we study \u201ewhiteness\u201f? Or could this simply re-centre \u201ewhiteness\u201f as an \ninsidious basis of social norms, ideals and unspoken claims to historical \nprivilege? \n- In what ways is racism exposed, critiqued and disrupted in \u201edoing\u201f identity - in \ncontestory forms of discourse and oppositional subject-positionings?  \n \nA critical question is how should we understand racism? Given the increased recognition \nthat race and racialised difference is historically and ideologically (re)produced, albeit \ndifferently in specific contexts as is evident in the papers that follow, how do we describe \nthe very \u201ereal\u201f consequences of the representations and practices that \u201erace\u201f certain bodies, \npositions, spaces and discourses, and privilege others in ways that normalise \u201ewhiteness\u201f \nand coerce alternative perspectives into one particular way of knowing. Recognising that \n                                                          \n3\n Just as is now common practice with the term \u201erace\u201f, we have chosen to disrupt and de-essentialise readings \nof \u201ewhiteness\u201f using parentheses.  \n 3 \n\u201erace\u201f and difference are constructed, performatively produced and embodied in particular \nways that protect particular investments, particular identities and particular relations of \nprivilege and oppression, does not mean that we can now simply deconstruct \u201erace\u201f. Nor \ndoes this mean we can now move into relationships, locations, subjectivities and practices \nthat are somehow \u201eabove and beyond\u201f the significance and materiality of \u201erace\u201f and racism \nacross local and global contexts (Omi, 2001; Durrheim and Dixon, this issue), even though \nthis would be a laudable aim of an antiracist agenda. Racism cannot be so easily dismissed, \nas the paper \u201eAgainst the notion of a new racism\u2019 by Colin Leach discusses. Leach offers a \ndetailed history of the ways in which racism has been and is theorised in the social sciences \nand is played out in a range of contexts (focussing mainly on America, Australia and \nWestern Europe). He warns against the dangers of faulty conceptualizations of racism, \nechoing Miles (1989) who has stated \u201cif the analysis is wrong, then it is likely that the \npolitical strategy will not achieve the intended objectives\u201d (p. 5). Leach argues that we need \nto be very cautious of claims to so-called \u201enew\u201f forms of cultural racism, offers a historical \nanalysis of the intersection of biologising accounts of racism and narratives that work up \nclaims to essential cultural differences and concludes that there are in fact significant \nhistorical continuities in the operations of racism. This disrupts current assumptions about \n\u201enew racism\u201f and encourages us to problematise the making of 'race' and racism in \nacademia and the role we all play in developing and contesting concepts and theories that \nmaintain the significance of \u201erace\u201f in our academic and everyday understandings of social \nrelations and subjectivities. \n \n 4 \nProposals of how Social Psychology should study racism are also given in the paper \nStudying talk and embodied practices: Towards a psychology of materiality of \u2018race \nrelations\u2019 by Kevin Durrheim and John Dixon. After providing valuable critiques of both \nthe \u201eimpoverished realism\u201f of attitudinal studies and the \u201eselective anti-realism\u201f of \ndiscursive approaches to racism, these authors argue that an adequate social psychology of \nracism must focus on the embodied and located everyday practices (and talk about such) \nwhich bring \u201erace\u201f into being and make it appear \u201ereal\u201f. In examining both people\u201fs \nmovements on a desegregated beach in South Africa and interviews with black and white \nbeach-goers, Durrheim and Dixon demonstrate how particular spaces provoke and impede \ncertain ways of \u201edoing race\u201f and maintaining the significance of racialised difference in the \ncontext of post-apartheid South Africa. Echoing Leach (this issue), this again points to the \nways in which the lived experience of racism is surprisingly resistant to change. Essentially \ntheir project is to demand a proper conceptualisation of racism, one that recognises both it \ntenacity and its flexibility, and highlights the very material reality of racism in everyday \npractices. This encourages us to think about the ways in which the different analytic tools \nwe use to research racism may in some ways actually obscure (and so protect) the very \nprocesses that we claim we are attempting to dismantle.  \n \nThis brings us to the thorny question of how our own subjectivities shape the ways in which \nwe research racism and assert anti-racist objectives and this, in turn, highlights our \n(dis)location in different racialising discourses and practices of privilege and oppression \u2013 \nas discussed by Damien Riggs and Martha Augoustinos in their paper on \u201eThe Psychic Life \nof Colonial Power: Racialised Subjectivities, Bodies and Methods\u2019. By focussing on the \n 5 \nquestion of subjectification, these authors call attention to whether \u201ewhiteness\u201f might be \ntorn free of historical investments of power and\/or dispossession. Their answer is an \nunambiguous no: the taking on of a position within \u201ewhiteness\u201f means to assume a variety \nof historical privileges and prerogatives endowed by legacies of racism. Indeed though \ndescribing themselves as non-indigenous Australians they recognise the necessary \ndifficulty of exposing and challenging collective claims to identity, belonging and privilege \nthat they themselves are invested in. This is an extremely insightful and refreshing account \nof the tensions and possibilities for doing and living a critical social psychology of anti-\nracism for those of us privileged by our position, heritage and, fundamentally, skin. Key \nhere is their warning that adopting the stance of the \u201ecritical\u201f researcher may itself function \nas a disavowal of how one profits from particular distributions and arrangements of \nracialized power. Once again, their paper documents the embodied and materialised nature \nof racism and demands a thorough problematising of the operation of subjectivity and \npower at the level of the psyche. Resisting individualising and psychologising versions of \nracism, here the psyche is conceptualised as a collective practice, and their research reveals \nhow racialised power relations are evident in collective memories and founded on a \ncollective disavowal of colonial violence. Through a discussion of white non-indigenous \nAustralian identities and claims to belonging and difference, Riggs and Augoustinos \ndemonstrate that that racism is foundational to white subjectivities and hence any functional \nanalysis of racism should disrupt the normativity and symbolic violence of \u201ewhiteness\u201f. \nThis demands an analysis of how white bodies, identities and relationships are \u201eraced\u201f in \nways that are normally only seen and felt from the position the racialised other.  \n \n 6 \nAll of the papers in the special issue, to varying degrees, implicitly ask whether we should \nstudy \u2018whiteness\u2019? Or could this simply re-centre \u2018whiteness' as an insidious basis of social \nnorms, ideals and claims to historical privilege, particularly in post-imperial Western \nsettings, where \u201ewhiteness\u201f is often evoked as  - even if in an unspoken way \u2013 as a common \ndenominator for a series of moral values, of culture, achievement, \u201ecivilization\u201f, moral \nconduct, reliability and so forth? How can we problematise its role in the politics of \nracialised difference in specific post-colonising locations without reaffirming its dominance \nand privilege? While these discussions are well-rehearsed in the field of critical race and \ncultural studies, it is relatively recently that Social Psychological theorising and research \nhas recognised how \u201ewhiteness\u201f itself generates racism, racialised identities and resistance \nto anti-racist politics. There is wisdom in advocating caution against \u201estudies of whiteness\u201f \nas these may constitute either the expression of guilt and anxiety or the desire to capture \nand maintain racialised difference (and so white privilege). A refusal to mainstream \u201eother\u201f \nperspectives, particularly Indigenous knowledges, leads all too easily into a colonisation of \nresearch into racism (Ahmed, 2004; Green and Sonn, this issue), and a subsequent \nunwillingness to recognise one\u201fs own investment \u2013 particularly as researchers who share in \nthe benefits of \u201ewhiteness\u201f - in the ongoing (re)production of relations of racism. The \noutcome of such an approach may ultimately be a reluctance to expose and disrupt the ways \nin which white identities and practices of privilege produce and defend racialised \ninequalities and oppression (Riggs and Augoustinos, 2004; Thompson, 2003). One of the \nways in which racism works is to fix the direction of the gaze onto the racialised other: it is \nthe black, or brown, other who embodies difference, transgresses norms and so presents the \n\u201eproblem of race\u201f (Hall, 2000; Henriques, 1998). Problematising \u201ewhiteness\u201f, exposing the \n 7 \nracialisation of \u201ewhiteness\u201f, and so breaking the racist and racialising gaze, both in day-to-\nday and scientific discourses, is then an urgent task for a critical social psychology of \nracism.  \n \nIndeed, as Meredith Green and Christopher Sonn argue in their paper \u2018Examining \ndiscourses of whiteness and the potential for Reconciliation\u2019 \u201ewhiteness\u201f should be seen as \nthe problematic centre of racism. In their exploration into competing discourses on \n\u201ewhiteness\u201f, nation, difference and Indigenous communities in Australia they demonstrate \nthat the production, defence and contestation of white privilege can only be understood as \nongoing political, psychological and, fundamentally, collective projects: products of both \nhistory and subjectivity. They discuss the need to constantly assert who belongs and who \nknows about \u201ebeing Australian\u201f and \u201ethe Indigenous other\u201f and so reveal the unfinished and \nanxious busy-ness of \u201ewhiteness\u201f in this context. This highlights that while \u201ewhiteness\u201f is \nrarely \u201eseen\u201f, particularly by those of us who are privileged by it, the inherent tensions and \ncontradictions of racism necessitate that \u201ewhiteness\u201f is constantly worked up and defended \nin discourses that appear as assertions of cultural connection, empathy and anti-racism. \nHence, as Green and Sonn suggest, racism needs to be challenged by exposing the \nhistorical, institutional and political (re)production of white dominance, privilege and \npower, while engaging with Indigenous knowledges as spaces of critique, resistance and \nsocial transformation. What this invites is a series of strategic interventions into the \nproduction of meanings and thought alike, both of which the authors emphasize, are \nessentially argumentative and dialogical in nature. It is on the basis of such tactical \ninterventions that new ways of seeing other each, and so new ways of imagining identity, \n 8 \nbelonging and community come into being. Their focus on history and the potential for \nchange highlights the role of subjectivity and agency in the production and contestation of \nracism and the possibilities of resistance at both micro- and macro- political levels.  \n \nThese issues are taken up and developed by Steve Kirkwood, James Liu and Ann \nWeatherall in their examination of different strategies of collaboration and resistance \npeople employ to expose racism and white privilege in \u2018Challenging the Standard Story of \nIndigenous Rights in Aotearoa \/ New Zealand\u2019. Their discussion brings to the fore \nquestions about what ways in which racism may be exposed, critiqued and disrupted in \n\u2018doing\u2019 identity - in contestory forms of discourse and oppositional subject-positionings. \nHow can we negotiate, navigate and confront the significance of racism and rupture its hold \nover the ways in which we make sense of ourselves and make sense of each other? Their \ndiscussion of how the ethnic majority may develop counter arguments to the \u201eStandard \nstory\u201f of colonisation and white privilege in Aotearoa\/New Zealand illustrates how racist \ndiscourses may be challenged, problematised and, in certain moments, rejected. Their \nresearch examines the possibilities for supporting anti-racist projects (such as indigenous \nrights to land and the telling of Aotearoa\u201fs history) that facilitate personal and political \naction against discrimination. Kirkwood, Liu and Weatherall focus on the argumentative \nresources that might be drawn on as means of strengthening indigenous rights claims - in \ndoing so they reveal how the oppressive monologue of white privilege may be undermined, \nand point to the ways in which we may disrupt and transgress the structures and discourses \nthat continue to differentially racialize subjects of different histories of possession\/ \nsubjugation nonetheless. This, it should be noted, is a discursive tactics of resistance in \n 9 \nwhich relevant strategies of argumentation and opposition remain embedded within the \nspecific context of particular historical localities.  What these authors highlight \u2013 in much \nthe same manner as Green and Sonn \u2013 is that a critical social psychology of racism must \nexamine our individual and collective involvements in procedures and practices of racism \n(which are always argumentative, dialogical, contestable) that racialise but that also reveal \npossibilities for engagement, collaboration, critical dialogue and intervention. \n \nAdvocating disruption and contradiction \nThe main question for our project, we believe, is what difference does difference make? \nThat is, it is not enough for psychologists in the field of racism to point to and assess the \nways in which racism operates and the ways it marks our understanding and subjectivities, \nas Hopkins, Reicher and Levine (1997) have also argued. It is not even enough to reveal its \nsimultaneously psychological and political, subjective and ideological, local and global \ndynamics \u2013 though this would be a good start. We must problematise the (re)productions of \nracialised difference and ask \u2013 what is the point and purpose of our studies? Is it to examine \nand describe the social psychological machinery of racism \u2013 or is it to provoke, to disrupt \nthe ways we think about, deny, \u201edo\u201f and so perpetuate racialised categories, spaces, \npractices and identities \u2013 both in the day-to-day and in the institutionalised setting of social \nscientific discourse? We would suggest that it is this latter aim, to disrupt productions of \nunequal difference, and reveal our own collusion in racialised relations of power and \nhistories of colonial violence and genocide, that we see as imperative to a functionally \ncritical psychology of racism, and it is to this objective that the papers included here speak.  \n \n 10 \nHowever it is also important to also recognise the political dangers inherent in overplaying \nresistance - and recognise that this could, ironically, undermine the analysis of racism itself \n\u2013 even in forums and relationships that set out to challenge racism (Srivastava, 1996). So \nwhile there does need to be an emphasis on the intransigence of racism and its multiple \n(re)workings we also need clear examples of how to think about cosmopolitanism\/ \nmulticulture and viable resistant subjectivities. What we need to do is recognise the \ncontradictory but necessary aims in presenting a critical analysis of racism  \u2013 looking \nbeyond the limiting discourses and subject positions of racism and imagining the \npossibilities in spaces and relationships that de-racialise practices and identities, while \nacknowledging the practical impossibility of moving beyond \u201erace\u201f as part of our current \nideological realities. So while we have to acknowledge the continuing psychic hold and the \nmateriality of racism, as do papers included here, we as critical psychologists need to take \nup and challenge racialised practices and identity constructions; we need not only to \nexamine how they are constructed \u2013 we also need to examine how they may be exposed and \ndisrupted in everyday and scientific discourses. We need to talk and work beyond the \n\u201efixing\u201f and \u201efitting\u201f of racism (fixing the racialising gaze and fitting us into particular ways \nof being seen), while acknowledging the inherent difficulties, challenges and apparent \nimpossibilities of such a project. Our role here is not of course to settle this debate, but \nrather to indicate its importance for a critical social psychology of racism. \n \nHere it benefits us to make illustrative reference to a debate outside of the domain of Social \nPsychology, to focus our attentions very briefly on Edward Said\u201fs (1983) critique of Michel \nFoucault\u201fs formidable analysis of modern power. While initially approving of Foucault\u201fs \n 11 \nimpressive formulations of a mode of power that is as productive as it extensive, as \nsubjectifying as it is complete, Said later took Foucault to task for being \u201epower\u201fs scribe\u201f: \nthat is, for an unbalanced focus which ultimately came to present modern power not only as \nmonumental \u2013 indeed, as sophisticated and efficient almost beyond comprehension \u2013 but, \nworse yet, as practically inescapable.  One might suggest that a similar argument may be \nlevelled at those approaches to a critical social psychology of racism that emphasize the \nintransigence, the obduracy, the historical persistence of racist relations of power, without \ndevoting adequate attentions to the practical means and procedures which may dismantle \nfacets of its functioning. The implications thus set into play - that racism is an ever-present \nfactor of history, an inevitable and even \u201cnatural\u201d social formation whose complexity and \nembeddedness will always elude our attempts at resistance \u2013 do not serve us well. None of \nthis is to deny the terrible force and violence of various forms of racism and racialized \nthinking that have characterized Western modernity in particular for centuries, nor is it to \neasily subscribe to a utopian version of a non-racist future which causes us to become \nnegligent in our attentions to the racisms of the here and now: it is though to suggest we \nneed be aware of undermining our own ability to formulate meaningful forms of resistance \nby fixating simply on the immensity of racism, and to succumbing to tacit forms of \nresignation, defeatism, fatalism as a result. In this respect it is worth asking whether our \nobjectives here are best described as \u201ea critical social psychology of racism\u201f, and not rather \nas a \u201ecritical social psychology of antiracism\u201f that places an account of disruption and \nresistance at its heart.  \n \n 12 \nCritical antiracist work must therefore remain aware that recourse to the language and \nlogics of \u201crace\u201d remains always tethered to a set of conceptualizations that never \ncompletely escapes the horizon of racialization brought about by racism itself. The most \nvocal proponent of such a view is Paul Gilroy, who warns about the problems of slipping \ninto a view in which \u201crace\u201d, however unintentionally, seems to precede racism (or exist \noutside of it), becoming all too easily thus \u201can eternal cause of racism rather than\u2026its \ncomplex, unstable product\u201d (2004, p. 16). Or, in slightly different terms: \u201cRacism involves \na mode of exploitation and domination that is not merely compatible with the phenomena \nof racialized differences but has amplified and projected them in order to remain \nintelligible, habitable, and productive\u201d (p. 33, our emphasis).  \n \nIf social psychology is to make a useful contribution to the analysis of racism, we suggest \nwe need to explore the ways in which it becomes unintelligible, problematic, contested and \nrejected in people\u201fs everyday sense-making, cultural practices and social relationships. This \nis not to imagine some idealized world where racism has lost it\u201fs grip over our collective \nnarratives and multiple subjectivities, a de- or a-racialised utopia (Ahmed, 2004), but it is to \npresent the possibilities for thinking beyond and so living beyond the ways which racism \ncurrently limits the possibilities of community, selfhood and planetary humanity, as Gilroy \n(2000) has put it. We do not suggest that this is what the special issue has achieved, but we \nhope that the papers presented here will move towards this end by provoking discussions of \nhow we \u201edo race\u201f and how we \u201edisrupt race\u201f in our work and in the everyday.  \n \n \n 13 \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thanks all of those colleagues who acted as reviewers of papers for this \nspecial issue, as well as all of those who participated in the various \u201eTowards a critical \nsocial psychology of racism\u2019 events held this year (an LSE workshop in March, two \nsymposia held in South Africa in June and July 2005).
