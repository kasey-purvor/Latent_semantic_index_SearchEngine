Extensive \nairborne survey has allowed us to derive improved subglacial topography for the Pine Island \nGlacier basin.  The trunk of this glacier lies in a narrow, 250-km long, 500-m deep sub-\nglacial trough, suggesting a long-lived and constrained ice stream.  Two tributaries lie in \nsimilar troughs, others lie in less defined, shallower troughs.  The lower basin of the glacier \nis surrounded by bedrock, which, after deglaciation and isostatic rebound, could rise above \nsea level.  This feature would impede ice-sheet collapse initiated near the grounding line of \nthis glacier, and prevent its progress into the deepest portions of WAIS.   The inland-slope of \nthe bed beneath the trunk of the glacier, however, confirms potential instability of the lower \nbasin, containing sufficient ice to raise global sea by ~24 cm.  \n1 Introduction \nPine Island Glacier drains around 175 000 km2 of West Antarctica, and has a complex \nsystem of tributaries feeding the main ice stream [Stenoien and Bentley, 2000].  Ice flow \nclose to the grounding line is unusually fast (>2.5 km a-1) and its flux is one of the largest in \nAntarctica.  Recent satellite studies have produced the most comprehensive mapping of \n                                                \n1 British Antarctic Survey, Natural Environment Research Council, Madingley Road, Cambridge, CB3 \n0ET, United Kingdom \n2 Optimare Sensorsysteme AG, Am Luneort 15, D-27572 Bremerhaven, Germany. \n3 Institute for Geophysics, University of Texas at Austin, 4412 Spicewood Springs Rd, Bldg 600, \nAustin, TX 78759, USA. \nSubglacial topography beneath Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica, 14\/08\/07          2\nchange for any Antarctic ice stream: between 1992 and 2001 the ice stream and its inland \nbasin thinned [Shepherd et al., 2004]; during the period 1992\u201398, the grounding line \nretreated at a rate of almost one kilometre per year [Rignot, 1998]; two episodes of \nacceleration have been observed (1974-87 and 1994-2000) separated by around seven \nyears of steady flow [Joughin et al., 2003; Rignot et al., 2002], and this acceleration of 22 % \nappears to be responsible for the present imbalance in the Pine Island Glacier basin; the \nfloating portion the ice stream, its ice shelf, has been thinning for almost three decades \n[Bindschadler, 2002], although the position of the ice front has not shown any clear trend \nover the last 50 years [Rignot, 2002].   \nAlthough change throughout the Pine Island Glacier basin and the other glaciers of the \nAmundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) is now established, it has yet to be determined whether \nthese changes are evidence of ongoing deglaciation or simply a fluctuation that does not \nthreaten the equilibrium of the ice sheet.  The use of numerical models to make predictions \nin this regard is, however, significantly hampered by the lack of a good sub-glacial \ntopography on which to base such models.  The BEDMAP compilation, for example (Figure \n1a) [Lythe et al., 2001], used data from oversnow traverses and a handful of airborne \nsurveys flights, and so gives only a broad picture of the subglacial topography.  \nDuring the austral summer of 2004\/05 a collaborative US\/UK field campaign undertook a \nsystematic geophysical survey of the entire Amundsen Sea embayment using comparable \nairborne survey systems mounted in Twin Otter aircraft.  Here we present the portion of the \nsurvey covering the Pine Island Glacier basin led by British Antarctic Survey.  A companion \npaper [Holt et al., in press] provides a description of the survey covering Thwaites, Smith \nand Kohler glacier basins undertaken by University of Texas.  \n2 Data acquisition \nOperating from a temporary field camp (PNE, S 77\u00b0 34\u2019 W 095\u00b0 56\u2019) during the 2004\/05 \naustral summer; we collected ~35,000 km of airborne survey data.  Our aircraft was \nequipped with dual-frequency carrier-phase GPS for navigation, radar altimeter for surface \nmapping, wing-tip magnetometers, gravity meter, and a new ice-sounding radar system \n(PASIN).  In this paper, we describe results arising from the measurement of surface and \nice-thickness. \nThroughout the campaign, PASIN was configured to operate with a transmit power of 4 kW \naround a central frequency of 150 MHz.  A 0.1-\u03bcsec pulse optimized for imaging the near-\nsurface layering was interleaved with a 4-\u03bcsec, 10-MHz chirp that was used to successfully \nobtain bed-echoes through ice more than 4200 m thick. \nSubglacial topography beneath Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica, 14\/08\/07          3\nPost-processing of GPS data allowed determination of aircraft positions to better than \u00b1 1 m.  \nThe network acquired during the 30 flights of the campaign is shown in Figure 1b. Most \nflights (~25) were in a regular 30-km grid flown at the constant elevation required for the \nacquisition of gravity data.  Five flights over the main trunk and tributaries of Pine Island \nGlacier, on which gravity data were not acquired, were flown at a constant 150-m terrain \nclearance to optimize radar data.  \nTravel-time was converted to ice thickness assuming a wave-velocity of 168 m \/ \u00b5sec, with a \nuniform addition of 10 m to account for presence of low-density ice in the near surface.  \nCrossover analysis yielded RMS differences of around 23 m in ice thickness.  These \ndifferences are substantially greater than the wavelength of 150 MHz radio waves in ice (~1 \nm), and result largely from off-nadir reflections and interpretation\/digitizing uncertainty. \n3 Topographic analysis \nThe bed elevation data collected during this campaign were combined with other data \n(Figure 1b) to produce a new subglacial topography (Figure 1c) using techniques described \nelsewhere [Holt et al., in press].  Where the ice thickness measurements were not tied to \nprecise GPS measurements of surface elevation, we extracted surface elevation from a \ndigital elevation model derived from satellite altimetry [Bamber and Gomez-Dans, 2005].  A \ndigital version of this grid is available from the National Snow and Ice Data Center \n(www.nsidc.org).  \n4 Discussion \nWhile it might be argued that the new subglacial topography shows no new regional-scale \nfeatures, the primary objective of this survey was to provide a subglacial topography on \nwhich to build a capacity for predictive ice-sheet modelling, and in this respect, even without \nsophisticated modelling the topography permits some valuable conclusions to be drawn.  \nAll of the subglacial troughs in this region are narrower and deeper than suggested by the \nBEDMAP topography.  In particular, the Byrd Subglacial Basin (BSB) is, at its narrowest \npoint, only 30 km wide but reaches a depth of 2300 m below sea level, and, in places, is \nmore than 1000 m deeper than the surrounding bed.  The confluence of BSB and the \nBentley Subglacial Trench (BST) is now clearly delineated.   \nThe northern edge of the Ellsworth Subglacial Highlands (ESH) is more abrupt than \npreviously thought, and we can for the first time resolve a series of sub-glacial valleys that \nemerge from ESH into the BST.  It is probable that these features formed at a time when ice \ndid not fill BST but a small ice cap drained from ESH through small glaciers that shaped \nthese valleys.  \nSubglacial topography beneath Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica, 14\/08\/07          4\nIn other parts of WAIS the palaeo-shoreline calculated for de-glacial (isostatically-\nrebounded) topography, provides a good template for the onset of fast ice-flow [Blankenship \net al., 2001; Studinger et al., 2001].  This was justified by reasoning that the presence of \nmarine sediments provides the conditions required to initiate streaming flow, and such \nsediments only accumulate below the de-glacial shoreline.  Comparison of ice-flow speeds \n(Figure 1e) and de-glacial topography (Figure 1f, calculated assuming Airy compensation, \nallowing for an in-flux of ocean water but neglecting flexural rigidity of the lithosphere) shows \nno similar correspondence in this area.  It is clear that the distribution of fast-ice-flow in Pine \nIsland Glacier basin is strongly controlled by the sub-glacial topography.  The trunk of Pine \nIsland Glacier and its two major tributaries [tributaries, 5 and 3, identified by Stenoien and \nBentley, 2000] occupy deep sub-glacial troughs between 700 and 1000 m lower than \nadjacent bed.  Shallower (<500 m) and much less distinct troughs lie beneath the six other \ntributaries (1, 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9) now visible in the velocity map.  Figure 1f shows, however, \nthat during de-glacial conditions the majority of the Pine Island Glacier basin was far below \nsea level, and in this area, there is no simple correspondence between fast ice-flow and \npalaeo-shoreline.   \nThe inland divide of the Pine Island Glacier drainage basin has been delineated by several \nauthors based solely on surface slope [e.g. Vaughan et al., 2001].  Each has suggested the \nexistence of a northern basin comprising the main trunk or the glacier and tributaries, and a \nmore slowly draining southern basin, overlying BST, BSB and part of ESH.  A narrow \u201cneck\u201d \noverlying BSB apparently separates the two portions of the basin.  Given the presence of a \nbed-high (marked H in Figure 1c,f), which is in places <400 m below sea level, it might \nappear that ice in the southern basin would most easily drain by joining ice flowing west \nalong BSB and into the Thwaites Glacier.  The, ice-velocity measured at PNE camp during \nits occupation (14 m a-1, along 014\u00b0T), however confirms ice-flow parallel to the surface \nslope and that the basin shape drawn by previous authors was broadly correct. \nThe fact that bed-high H does not currently impede ice-flow from the southern to the \nnorthern basins does not, however, mean that this feature is insignificant.  Together, the \nareas of high bed on the northern margins and bed-high H, effectively encircle the northern \nbasin.  If the ice sheet in this area were to be lost, the isostatic rebound would bring the \nhighest parts of this bed high H above sea level.  So although, there appears to be no \nsubstantial bed sill inland of the present grounding line that might halt a future retreat into the \nnorthern basin, the inland-rising bed slope around bed-high H (Figure 1d) suggests that a \ncollapse would eventually be constrained to the northern basin and would not reach the \ndeepest parts of WAIS beneath BSB and BST.  The volume of ice residing above the \nSubglacial topography beneath Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica, 14\/08\/07          5\nfloatation limit in the northern basin is equivalent to 24 cm of global sea level rise, while that \nin the southern basin is equivalent to 28 cm of global sea level rise. \nThis inference needs to be contrasted with Thwaites Glacier [Holt et al., in press] where, \nexcept from short-wavelength roughness, the bed slopes inland monotonically from the \ngrounding line to the deepest part of BSB.  Hughes identified Pine Island and Thwaites \nglaciers as the \u201cweak underbelly of the WAIS\u201d [Hughes, 1981], the portion most likely to \nsuffer dynamic collapse.  Our sub-glacial topography appears to show that while northern \nbasin of Pine Island Glacier may well be prone to collapse, Hughes\u2019 epithet may now be \nmore appropriate to Thwaites Glacier alone. \n5 Conclusions \nThe new sub-glacial topography derived for Pine Island Glacier basin is a clear improvement \non that derived by BEDMAP and will provide the basis for improved predictions of whether \nrecent changes observed in this area are evidence of ongoing deglaciation, or simply \nfluctuations that do not seriously threaten the long-term equilibrium of the ice sheet.   \nIt is now clear that sub-glacial character of Pine Island Glacier is similar to those in the \nWeddell Sea sector of WAIS (e.g. Rutford Ice Stream) in that its trunk and main tributaries lie \nin deep and confined topographic channels that probably represent some pre-glacial \ngeologic features. Thwaites Glacier, on the other hand, more nearly resembles the Siple \nCoast Ice Streams by lying in a broad but poorly defined trough.  It may be reasonable to \nimplicate this difference as the cause of the contrasting ways by which each may have \nincreased its flux in the last decade: it was reported [Rignot et al., 2002] that Pine Island \nGlacier had maintained its width but accelerated, while Thwaites Glacier maintained its \nspeed but widened.  A comprehensive understanding of both styles of drainage will thus be \nrequired to fully predict the future stability of Amundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica.   \nThe existence of a bed-high surrounding the lower portion of the PIG basin, suggests that a \ncollapse initiated along the trunk of PIG would not progress catastrophically into the southern \nbasin and the deepest parts of WAIS.  However, collapse of the northern basin alone would \nraise sea level by 24 cm and there appears to be no bed topography that might halt a retreat \nfrom the present grounding line into the northern part of the basin.  This means that the Pine \nIsland Glacier basin still represents a significant threat to sea level over coming centuries.   \n6 Acknowledgements \nThe campaign received logistical support from British Antarctic Survey and National Science \nFoundation, and was conducted in collaboration with University of Texas.
