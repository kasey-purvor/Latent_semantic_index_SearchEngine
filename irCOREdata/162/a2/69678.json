Governance and legitimacy \nA number of commentators have described and analyzed in various ways the shift from \ngovernment to governance and the emergence of international regulatory networks.1 They \ndescribe these changes variously as involving a fragmentation, hollowing-out, \ndisaggregation, or decentering of the state, but are generally agreed that they entail a \ndevolution of specific functions to specialized regulators accompanied by new types of \npublic-private interactions. There is also a general consensus that these are global trends, \nalthough perspectives vary as to the importance of domestic political processes\u2014\ncompared with international influences\u2014as drivers of these processes.  \nA key question raised by these changes is their implications for the legitimacy of \ngovernance processes. Here opinions are more varied. Some see these emergent \nprocesses, especially the growth of international regulatory or governance networks, \nessentially as further development of the classic liberal system of interdependent states; \nindeed, they are seen as a strengthening of that system. Thus, Anne-Marie Slaughter has \npainted a picture of \u201cthe real New World Order,\u201d which she describes as a growth of \ncooperative networks among government officials at the substate level, who remain \naccountable to citizens through national state mechanisms.2 However, in response to \nthose who argue that this is a more far-reaching and problematic phenomenon that raises \nbasic questions about political legitimacy,3 she concedes that there may be some \naccountability problems.4 While continuing to maintain the legitimacy of these forms of \n                                                 \n*Emeritus Professor, Lancaster University Law School.

The main focus of attention has been on the \u201cdemocracy deficit\u201d of the \ninternational sphere. However, national systems of representative democracy, even those \nwith a long history, have been under great strain, as well, and have been undergoing \nextensive reforms. It is generally believed that decisions at the global or international \nlevel are too remote from ordinary citizens to be subject to the usual accountability \nmechanisms of representative democracy.8 With the growth in the scope and importance \nof decisions taken at the international level, legitimation has come to depend, first, on \nexpertise and, second, on the increasing legalization of international institutions. There \nhas also been a growing debate about constitutionalization at the international level, as it \nbuilds further on the existing process of legalization. However, any additional extension \nof the dominant liberal model of constitutionalism to the international level would \nentrench constitutionalized norms as constraints on national states. Not surprisingly, this \npossibility has proven controversial, in view of the implications for national structures of \ndemocratic accountability. \nThe legitimacy of important and increasingly extensive international regulation \nhas come to rely, substantially, on expertise, since much of the activity of international \nregulatory networks is done by cadres of technical specialists, sometimes described as \n\u201cepistemic communities.\u201d This concept was developed within a neofunctionalist \nparadigm to suggest that a stronger basis for international cooperation could be provided \nby delegating specific issues to specialists who would deal with them in a depoliticized \nfashion, deploying scientific, managerial, or professional techniques and working within \nshared universal discourses. This perspective fits with the traditional Weberian view of \ntechnocracy, seeing it as an instrument of politics and as a means of implementing \npolicies that have been formulated through political processes. From this vantage point, \nthe increasing degree of delegation to specialist regulators is understood as a response to \nthe problems of governing ever more complex societies; thus, ever greater autonomy is \nextended to technocratic decision makers within a policy framework set by government. \nIn the international context, it has been suggested that communities of experts, working \n                                                 \n5 A NEW WORLD ORDER, supra note 1, at 230\u2013260. \n6 Id. at 240. \n7 Anne-Marie Slaughter, Global Government Networks, Global Information Agencies, and Disaggregated \nDemocracies, in PUBLIC GOVERNANCE IN THE AGE OF GLOBALIZATION 121, 148\u2013152 (Karl-Heinz Ladeur \ned., Ashgate 2004). \n8 See, e.g., Robert A. Dahl, Can International Organizations Be Democratic? A Skeptic\u2019s View, in \nDEMOCRACY\u2019S EDGES 19 (Ian Shapiro & Casiano Hacker-Cord\u00f3n eds., Cambridge Univ. Press 1999). \n 4\nwithin a shared epistemic perspective, can facilitate the resolution of global policy issues \nby \u201cnarrowing the range within which political bargains could be struck.\u201d9  \nHowever, the complexity of governing modern societies has exacerbated the \ndangers that Weber had already identified with the task of controlling the irresistible \nadvance of bureaucracy; at stake is the safeguarding of individual freedom and \ndemocracy.10 The fragmentation of the state and the new forms of interaction between the \npublic and the private spheres entail not a retreat from but a remodeling of statehood; the \ncombination of these forces has led to a trend toward what has been described as a \u201cnew \nregulatory state.\u201d11 Functions previously considered unique to government have been \nrecast as societal problems concerning a variety of actors.12 Influential commentators \nhave argued for the redefinition of the role of government in order to separate \u201csteering\u201d \nfrom \u201crowing,\u201d suggesting that politicians should define aims and targets but subcontract \ndelivery, which should be competitive and aim to meet the needs of customers.13 While \nmaintaining a separation of policy formulation and operational delivery, this approach \ndevolves greater responsibilities onto those responsible for implementation who are, \ntherefore, more directly accountable for the delivery of services, even though this process \ntakes place through more diffuse, market-style mechanisms.  \nThe fragmentation of the state and the shift away from hierarchical command-\nand-control towards more decentralized, networked forms of regulation can also be \nunderstood from a Foucauldian perspective of \u201cgovernmentality.\u201d The disintegration of \nhierarchical bureaucratic structures in both the public and private sectors can be seen as a \nshift in modes of social control toward more dispersed and internalized disciplinary \nforms\u2014\u201cfrom the cage to the gaze.\u201d14 Thus, the new regulatory governance may be said \nto involve a \u201cproliferation of a whole range of apparatuses pertaining to government and \na complex body of knowledges and \u2018know-how\u2019 about government.\u201d15 In particular, \nMiller and Rose have developed Latour\u2019s concept of \u201caction at a distance\u201d into a notion \n                                                 \n9 Emanuel Adler & Peter M.

The next section will briefly outline these characteristics, the third of which is \ntechnicism; this will be followed by  examples and analysis, focusing on the governance \nof finance and taxation. The final section will discuss some of the issues raised by the \ndebates on legification and constitutionalization of global institutions. This will focus \nmainly on the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is an important node or point of \nintersection for the various regulatory networks and has certainly become much more \nlegalized, and which some have suggested should be constitutionalized. \n \n1.1. Characteristics of multilevel global governance \nThe first characteristic of these new systems of governance can be discerned in the \ndestabilization of the traditional normative hierarchy, where\u2014on the one hand\u2014states \nwere bound by international law while\u2014on the other\u2014the choice of which national \nsystem of rules applied to the activities of private actors was determined by principles of \njurisdictional allocation and choice of law. The heterarchical character of networked \ngovernance means that the determination of the legitimacy of an activity under any one \nsystem of norms is rarely definitive; it can usually be sidestepped or challenged by \nreference to another system. Various forms of supranational and infranational law have \ncreated complex interactions between a variety of adjudicative and regulatory bodies at \ndifferent levels. These involve both competition and coordination.18 Similarly, various \ntypes of linkages have emerged between different but related regulatory networks, \nalthough their kaleidoscopic character makes it difficult to establish an overall coherence. \nThis gives private parties\u2014both individuals and, especially, legal persons such as firms \nand organizations\u2014opportunities to manage regulatory interactions through strategies of \nforum selection and \u201cforum-shifting.\u201d19 Indeed, as has been pointed out by commentators \n                                                 \n16 Peter Miller & Nikolas Rose, Governing Economic Life, 19 ECON. & SOC. 1, 10 (1990). \n17 See Sol Picciotto, Regulatory Networks and Multi-Level Global Governance, in RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS: \nSELF-GOVERNANCE AND LAW IN TRANSNATIONAL ECONOMIC TRANSACTIONS 315 (Olaf Dilling, Martin \nHerberg & Gerd Winter eds., Hart 2008). \n18 Debates about regulatory competition and the \u201crace to the bottom\u201d (or to the top), such as those discussed \nin DALE D. MURPHY, THE STRUCTURE OF REGULATORY COMPETITION: CORPORATIONS AND PUBLIC \nPOLICIES IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY (Oxford Univ. Press 2004), have tended to overlook the many ways in \nwhich regulatory regimes are interdependent and coordinated. See Picciotto Regulatory Criss-Cross, \nsupra note 1, at 91\u201392. \n19 This concept has been analyzed mainly in relation to powerful states\u2014that is, governments\u2014and in \nconnection with norm creation. See John Braithwaite & Peter Drahos, Forum-shifting and Contests of \nPrinciples, in GLOBAL BUSINESS REGULATION 564 (Cambridge Univ. Press 2000) (discussing how \nlawyers acting for private parties developed forum-shopping as a tactic). It has been extended beyond \n 6\nsuch as Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello, power in a networked world derives from \nmobility and connectedness.20  \nAs a second characteristic, we may observe that there has been a blurring between \ncategories of norms, in particular, between \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d and public and private law. \nThus, regulation typically involves a mixture of legal forms, both public and private, and \nan interplay between state and private ordering, or, frequently, the emergence of norms \nwith a hybrid status. Public bodies may use private law forms, such as service contracts, \nfor regulatory purposes,21 while private bodies may operate regulatory arrangements, \neven in relation to the public sector.22 Global economic regulatory networks, in \nparticular, use \u201csoft law\u201d forms, such as codes of conduct, memorandums of \nunderstanding (MOUs), and guidelines. This state of affairs is the result of several \nfactors.  \nOne such factor is the emergence of regulation based on the increased \nformalization of norms, taking the place of informal and closed systems of \u201cclub rule.\u201d23 \nA second stems from the previously mentioned trait, namely, that global governance is \nincreasingly heterarchical. From the perspective of the traditional hierarchical system, \ninternational or global norms governing nonstate entities have no formal binding force \nand, hence, are regarded as soft law. This includes the norms governing both private \nactors such as firms (for example, business codes of conduct and regulatory standards \ndeveloped by international bodies such as the International Standards Organization), as \nwell as public bodies (for example, MOUs between national regulators). Even \ngovernments may resort to soft forms of agreement to foster policy learning, convergence \nand cooperation, often between multiple layers of public and private bodies.24 \nThe third characteristic of multilayered governance, already discussed above, is \nthe fragmentation and technicization of state functions. Certainly, there is evidence that \nglobal expert networks have been extremely effective in mobilizing and sustaining some \nglobal governance regimes, as is revealed, for example, in Penelope Canan and Nancy \nReichman\u2019s sociological study of the \u201cglobal community\u201d of environmental experts and \n                                                                                                                                                 \nlitigation to the selection of jurisdictions of convenience in order to structure international business \nactivities for optimal regulatory exposure. Examples include such strategies (many of them driven by \nbusiness lobbies) as the use of havens for tax avoidance, flags of convenience for shipping, and offshore \nfinance centers for financial activities.  \n20 LUC BOLTANSKI & EVE CHIAPELLO, LE NOUVEL ESPRIT DU CAPITALISME [THE NEW SPIRIT OF \nCAPITALISM] 444\u2013455 (Gallimard 1999). \n21 See HUGH COLLINS, REGULATING CONTRACTS (Oxford Univ.

Far from being depoliticized, such \nnetworks often include activists as well as technical specialists; and even if the issues are \nspecialized, the participants share common social values. \nThese characteristics may be analyzed in relation to the governance of a variety of \nissues; for example, environmental protection, intellectual property, food production, \ncommunications, and the internet.26 \n \n1.2. Governance of taxation and finance: \u201cOffshore\u201d and the transformation of \nsovereignty \n \nA major catalyst in the fragmenting of state functions and the emergence of complex \njurisdictional interactions has been the development of so-called offshore statehood. This \ninvolves the creation of specific regulatory regimes governing particular activities, \nsometimes amounting to legal and constitutional enclaves or a kind of privatization of \nsovereignty.27  \nA notable example is that of \u201cflags of convenience\u201d (FoC) for international \nshipping. This arrangement, devised by U.S. lawyer-diplomats,28 dates back to the 1920s, \nwhen the U.S. authorities encouraged the registration of U.S.-owned ships in Panama in \norder to reduce costs while still ensuring the availability of ships in wartime. After the \nSecond World War, another similar group developed Liberia as a flag state, with the \nadded advantage that its shipping (and later corporate) registry business was \nsubcontracted to a U.S. corporation based near Washington.29 Thus, flag states essentially \n                                                 \n25 PENELOPE CANAN & NANCY REICHMAN, OZONE CONNECTIONS: EXPERT NETWORKS IN GLOBAL \nENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE (Greenleaf 2002). \n26 Another example is the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), whose province is internet regulation. \nSee A.

William Cromwell, of the New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, became Panama\u2019s \nrepresentative in the U.S.; he also acted for the shipowners. Cromwell was succeeded in this role by John \nFoster Dulles, the future secretary of state. See RODNEY P. CARLISLE, SOVEREIGNTY FOR SALE 16 (Naval \nInst. Press 1981). \n29 The Liberian International Ship and Corporate Registry is run from Vienna, Virginia, continuing an \narrangement originally devised by a group headed by Edward R. Stettinius, a former executive at General \nMotors and U.S. Steel who served as U.S. secretary of state under Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1947 he \nformed Stettinius Associates with former State Department colleagues and established various \ndevelopment projects in Liberia in partnership with the Liberian government. The ship registry was to be \n 8\noffer a ship registration service, the administration of which may have little or no \nphysical contact with the state itself since it is subcontracted to private firms. The actual \nsurveys and the issuing of safety certificates for ships are done by recognized private \nclassification societies, including the American Bureau of Shipping and Lloyd\u2019s Register \nof Shipping.30 Because of abiding concerns about the safety standards of such \u201copen \nregistries,\u201d spotlighted especially by the long-running campaign of the International \nTransport Federation (ITF) of trade unions, regulatory networks have emerged to try to \ndeal with low or substandard ships and registries. A key development has been \ncooperation between the maritime authorities of port states. These organizations now \ncoordinate their inspection systems, based on checklists of internationally agreed-upon \nstandards, deficiency reporting, a computerized database, and the sanction of detention of \nvessels found defective.31 Thus, the seaworthiness and employment conditions of ships \nare governed by a variety of regulatory bodies, both public and private, national and \ninternational. None of them have definitive jurisdiction, although port authorities can \napply the ultimate sanction of detention.32  \nThe use of havens for the avoidance of tax on income and profits, which was an \nelement in the FoC system, first emerged in the early decades of the twentieth century. It \nwas kept within tolerable bounds until the 1960s by a combination of national measures \n(controls on currency, capital movements, and asset transfers) and the allocation of tax \n                                                                                                                                                 \nthe longest lasting of these projects; by 1955, Liberia\u2019s was the leading flag of convenience. The \nStettinius group drafted Liberia\u2019s Maritime Code, which provides for the administration of the ship \nregistry to be subcontracted to a U.S.-based company. CARLISLE, supra note 29, 115\u2013119. During the \n1990\u201396 civil war, the registry\u2019s contribution to the Liberian national budget increased from 10\u201315 \npercent to 90 percent. In 1996, rebel leader Charles Taylor, by this time a member of a six-person Council \nof State, initiated legal action against the administrator, from which he had been unable to obtain funds \nduring the civil war. Aided by U.S. lawyer Lester Hyman, Taylor sued Virginia-based International \nRegistries Inc. (IRI) in the U.S. courts, alleging that IRI was diverting shipowners to another registry and \nhad failed to account properly to Liberia for its receipts. Once Taylor became president, his government \ncontracted with Hyman to establish the Liberian International Shipping and Corporate Registry (LISCR), \nwhich took over the business in 2000. See Report of the Panel of Experts Pursuant to Security Council \nresolution 1343 (2001), paragraph 19, concerning Liberia, U.N. Doc. S\/2001\/1015 (2001). LISCR makes \nprofits mainly from the corporate registry side of the business, which essentially facilitates tax avoidance. \nTelephone interview with Jill Keohane, senior vice-president of LISCR, Oct. 16, 2006. \n30Ten such bodies have formed the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS), which in \nDecember 2005 adopted a set of Common Structural Rules for ship classification and approval.

The increased international integration of \nbusiness by transnational corporations and corporate networks led to the growth of \nnetworks of international tax administration, although mainly among the leading \ncountries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. With the shift \nto currency convertibility, the liberalization of capital movements, and \ntransnationalization of banking, the tax havens also became offshore finance centers \n(OFCs), acting as catalysts for the emergence of a new internationalized financial system. \n\u201cOffshore\u201d became a generalized phenomenon by the 1970s and acted as a stimulus for \nthe dual process of national deregulation and international reregulation. Control based on \ndirect state command over the economic activity of no longer purely national firms often \nhad to be abandoned and, as a result, international regulatory networking gradually \nemerged.  \nLegal enclaves or special jurisdictions were created for a variety of purposes, \noften linking tax incentives with other regulatory advantages. These include export \nprocessing zones (EPZs), special economic zones, or enterprise zones. Building on the \nolder concept of free ports, which allowed duty-free importation of goods in transit, the \nEPZs facilitated the establishment of industries based on assembly tasks or the processing \nof imported inputs for reexport. However, they often went further and created enclaves in \nwhich other measures were relaxed or waived, especially employment and social \nprotection regulations.  \nAlthough specially designed laws may be found everywhere, some states or \nstatelets offer more comprehensive packages of arrangements specifically devised for \navoidance purposes of one sort or another; they may be considered designer jurisdictions. \nThis phenomenon\u2014with tax avoidance or evasion often a central feature\u2014has been \ndescribed as the \u201ccommercialization of sovereignty.\u201d33 It generally entails both special \nprovisions for nonresidents, taking advantage of legal fictions such as corporate \npersonality, and the indeterminacy of abstract legal concepts such as income and \nresidence. This type of \u201cring fencing\u201d has been offered in many countries, with the aim of \nattracting specific types of business or investment. However, the more comprehensive \npackage, offered by outright havens, usually depends on their having a regime of zero or \nlow taxation of income or profits, which applies to nonresidents; hence, it is mainly used \nfor so called letter-box companies or trusts as asset-management vehicles. The \nimportance of taxation to modern state economies and of income taxation means that \noutright havens of this sort often have some very distinctive features. \nThree examples may be taken as illustrations. Dubai is one of the former Trucial \nStates, which in 1971 merged to form the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Specific powers \nare delegated to the UAE federal government, while others are reserved to the member \nemirates; the emir of Dubai is currently prime minister of the UAE. The legal system is \nbased on a dual system of Shari\u2019a and civil courts, and the criminal law is enacted at \nfederal level. Although oil is important in Dubai\u2019s economy, its relatively lower level of \noil reserves, compared with the region, has led to a policy of economic development for \nthe purpose of attracting mobile business. This builds on the country\u2019s tradition as an \nentrep\u00f4t along what was known as the Pirate Coast. The Jebel Ali Free Zone has helped \n                                                 \n33 Ronen Palan, Tax Havens and the Commercialization of State Sovereignty, 56 INT\u2019L ORG. 151 (2002). \n 10\nestablish Dubai as a major port and was used as a model, first, for Dubai Internet City, \nwith its highly developed technical infrastructure, and, most recently, for the Dubai \nInternational Financial Centre (the DIFC), established in 2002. To facilitate this latter \ninstitution, the UAE government passed a decree creating, in essence, a legal enclave \nwithin the physical territory of the DIFC. This territory is now empowered to operate its \nown system of civil laws and, essentially, to govern commercial, corporate, and financial \nmatters with its own courts, staffed mainly by British judges.  \nA second example is the Cayman Islands (CI), a British dependency, now \nclassified as an overseas territory. The CI has long had a high degree of autonomy, even \nwhen administered by Britain from Jamaica and preferred not to become part of an \nindependent Jamaica; thus, it has remained a U.K. territory, with a very ambivalent \nrelationship to the various arms of the British government. The CI has associative status \nwith the EU, together with other overseas territories, under part four of the EC treaty; \nalthough in principle the overseas territories are part of the EC\u2019s customs union, they are \nallowed to \u201clevy customs duties which meet the needs of their development and \nindustrialization or produce revenue for their budgets.\u201d34 However, the CI has never had \nany direct taxation, and government revenues rely largely on indirect taxes, mainly \nimport duties, consumption taxes, and license fees. It emerged as an OFC in the 1970s \nand quickly became a major center of bank assets (largely notional), now ranked as the \nfifth largest globally, although its more recent growth has been in investment funds, \nespecially hedge funds and equity funds. The British-appointed governor chairs the \ncabinet, appoints three of the eight ministers, and has certain reserve powers, including a \ngeneral power to legislate \u201cin the interests of public order, public faith, and good \ngovernment.\u201d Although the U.K. government is mostly responsible for its international \nrelations, the power to negotiate international agreements has been delegated to the CI \nunder \u201cletters of Commitment\u201d from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, especially \nin relation to finance and tax matters. \nA third example is the Principality of Liechtenstein, which was part of the Holy \nRoman Empire before becoming a sovereign state in 1816. It remains closely tied to \nAustria, since its princes were prominent in the Austro-Hungarian Empire; indeed, they \nhad acquired the territory in order to qualify for a seat in the Imperial Diet and lived in \nVienna until after the First World War. At that time a poor rural territory, Liechtenstein \nentered into a customs and monetary union with Switzerland, and in the 1930s and \nespecially the 1950s it emerged as a prosperous if tiny enclave, with some high-tech \nindustry, but with an economy mainly based on finance, especially private banking. \nGeographically, it is hardly offshore, as a landlocked entity surrounded by other \nlandlocked states. It is, in many respects, closely integrated with those neighbors since it \nhas no major airport or rail connection and no physical border or customs formalities. \nHowever, both immigration and residency are very closely controlled.  \nThe prince is the hereditary head of state, and his powers were extended following \na controversial referendum in 2003. He represents the state in its international relations, \nalthough most treaties require the consent of the Parliament, and he must consent to any \nlaw before it can come into force. Liechtenstein has become known mainly as a center for \n                                                 \n34 Treaty Establishing the European Community (signed in Rome 25 March 1957), Article 133(4) \n 11\ndiscreet private banking, and additional confidentiality for private wealth may be \nprovided through the Anstalt, a type of trust. The prince is also the owner of LGT Group, \nthe largest private bank in his Principality, which manages the princely family\u2019s assets, as \nit proclaims in its marketing. In early 2008, Liechtenstein became engulfed in scandal, as \na former bank employee sold details of private accounts to tax authorities in Germany, \nwhich used them to launch raids and begin prosecutions against several hundred German \nresidents, including some prominent industrialists.  \nAlthough they are legal enclaves, the regulatory systems of such centers are \nclosely interlinked with those of other countries. Their status as havens depends on their \nability to offer regulatory advantages in relation to other countries, which means that they \nmust maneuver within certain limits of tolerance. Indeed, the emergence of OFCs in the \n1970s occurred with some degree of encouragement on the part of the monetary \nauthorities of the leading countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD); they offered a way of managing the transition from fixed to \nfloating exchange rates and the hard-to-control boundaries between the current and \ncapital accounts of the balance of payments. However, the rise of offshore finance has \nalso been identified, at various times since then, as a weak point in the system of financial \nregulation, both with regard to systemic security and in its use for illicit purposes. Thus, \nattempts have been made to bring the regulatory systems of OFCs into line with global \nnorms since the 1980s, mainly through informal international regulatory groupings such \nas the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision, the International Organization of \nSecurities Commissions, and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Concerns about \nthe increase in tax evasion and avoidance due to economic globalization also have led to \nattempts by the tax authorities of the OECD countries to take action against havens. \nThese efforts, since 1998, have been coordinated through the campaigns against \u201charmful \ntax competition\u201d of the OECD\u2019s Committee on Fiscal Affairs (OECD-CFA), and the \nCode of Conduct Group set up by the EU as a form of \u201csoft coordination.\u201d35 \nOffshore jurisdictions are not niche or marginal phenomena. As part of the \nattempt to bring them more closely into the global governance networks, organizations \nsuch as the OECD and the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) have identified more than \nforty countries as havens or OFCs (most of them being both). Beyond these specific \njurisdictions, \u201coffshore\u201d is also a system or process of regulatory interaction driven by \ncompetition, which, in many ways, also permeates major onshore states. To deal with \nboth aspects, attempts have been made to bring about some closer coordination of \nfinancial regulation, especially after the debates following the Asian crisis of 1997\u201398. \nThese efforts were orchestrated mainly through the G7 finance ministers and central bank \ngovernors, though drawing in a wider group of emerging economies and the leading \ndeveloping countries,36 which resulted in the establishment of the FSF. It was through \n                                                 \n35 Claudio M. Radaelli, The Code of Conduct against Harmful Tax Competition: Open Method of \nCoordination in Disguise?, 81 PUB. ADMIN. 513 (2003). \n36 The April 1998 meeting called by the G7 was attended by finance ministers and central bank governors \nfrom Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, \nItaly, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, the U.K., and \nthe U.S., as well as the heads of the Bank for International Settlements, International Monetary Fund, \nWorld Bank, and OECD; with some changes in membership, this meeting later became semiformalized \nas the G20. \n 12\nthis group that a compendium of financial standards and codes was identified and spelled \nout. The FSF continues to maintain an overview of these standards,37 although the actual \nmonitoring of compliance with these standards and codes by all major financial centers \nhas been turned over to the staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World \nBank (WB) (in conjunction with the FATF and related bodies for anti-money laundering \nand combating the financing of terrorism standards). The process by which this occurs is \ncalled the Reviews of Standards and Codes. However, the tax aspects have been kept \nseparate, remaining under the auspices of the OECD-CFA, which has established a global \nforum in response to the insistence of non-OECD countries that tax cooperation should \nbe even-handed, so as to establish a level playing field. \nThe upshot is that attempts to establish a clearer structure and more orderly \ncoordination of regulatory arrangements have tended, rather, to spawn new groupings and \nnetworks. \n \n2. Legitimacy and legalization \nThe law and lawyers have played a major role in the construction and management of \nthese globalized regulatory networks. Much of their work is low profile or behind the \nscenes. However, there has also been a more visible trend toward legalization of global \ngovernance institutions; to a great extent, it is in response to some of the legitimacy \nproblems mentioned above.  \nA conspicuous example is the WTO, as demonstrated by the great stress placed on \nthe WTO as embodying the rule of law in world trade. Thus, after the organization was \nshaken by the debacle at Seattle,38 the then\u2013secretary-general Mike Moore, delivering a \nspeech on \u201cThe Backlash against Globalization?\u201d concluded as follows: \nThe WTO is a powerful force for good in the world. Yet we are too \noften misunderstood, sometimes genuinely, often willfully. We are \nnot a world government in any shape or form. People do not want a \nworld government, and we do not aspire to be one. At the WTO, \ngovernments decide, not us. \n But people do want global rules. If the WTO did not exist, \npeople would be crying out for a forum where governments could \nnegotiate rules, ratified by national parliaments, that promote freer \ntrade and provide a transparent and predictable framework for \nbusiness. And they would be crying out for a mechanism that helps \ngovernments avoid coming to blows over trade disputes. That is \nwhat the WTO is. We do not lay down the law. We uphold the rule \n                                                 \n37 The FSF Secretariat prepares a paper for the biannual FSF meetings which surveys ongoing work and \nregulatory initiatives relating to financial market supervision, going well beyond the twelve existing \ncompendium standards. \n38 The negotiations to launch a new trade round at the Ministerial Conference held at Seattle in December \n1999 collapsed ignominiously, amid sharp disagreements in the closed sessions, while demonstrators \nfought police in the streets. \n 13\nof law. The alternative is the law of the jungle, where might makes \nright and the little guy doesn\u2019t get a look in.39 \n \nThe political acceptability of compliance with the wide range of WTO obligations rests \nessentially on the quasi-judicial form of its dispute-settlement (DS) procedure, and, \nprincipally, its Appellate Body (AB). Yet this role has been framed by a narrow mandate \nthat formally reserves the power to interpret the agreements to the \u201cpolitical\u201d bodies of \nmember state representatives.  \nAn influential group of commentators has suggested that the WTO rates highly \nwith regard to legification according to three criteria: that it is based on rules which are \nconsidered binding, which are precise, and the interpretation of which has been delegated \nto a third-party adjudicator.40 This has been criticized as taking a narrow view of law.41 \nThe formalist view rests on the premise that law provides relatively precise rules, so that \nlegalization reflects political decisions made by states to make \u201ccredible commitments,\u201d \nthe application of which they delegate to adjudicators operating within a formalist \nrationality.42 \nMatters are not so straightforward, however. WTO adjudication entails skillful \nnavigation through a labyrinth of legal rules, and not only within the complex structure of \nthe WTO agreements themselves but also among the many related regulatory regimes \nwith which they intersect. Moreover, the key WTO obligations are expressed in terms of \nabstract general principles, subject to counteracting exceptions and involving a high \ndegree of indeterminacy.43 Despite this, the AB has adopted a formalist approach that \nstresses a literal approach to the rules, largely to avoid accusations of creative \ninterpretation. It has done so with some subtlety, however, emphasizing the objective \napplication of the words of the agreements to placate the broader public while hoping to \npersuade specialists in trade and economic regulation through shared understandings of \nthe interpretations that are desirable to achieve the goals of free trade. Unfortunately, it \nrisks failing to convince insiders, while doing little to persuade a broader constituency of \nthe fairness of WTO rules.44 \n \n                                                 \n39 Mike Moore, The Backlash against Globalization?

Global rule of law and \u201cconstitutionalization\u201d \nThe trend toward legalization of global governance has been seen by some as leading to \nthe establishment of a global rule of law, formalized, perhaps, through forms of \n\u201cconstitutionalization.\u201d It is, again, the WTO that has been the focus of these debates, \nunsurprisingly, since its structure and emphasis on market liberalization has made it a \npoint of intersection among many regulatory arrangements.  \nThe theme of the WTO as institutionalizing the rule of law in the world economy \nhas been debated among academic commentators under the rubric of the \n\u201cconstitutionalization\u201d of international economic law. The term was applied to the \nWTO\u2019s predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), by the doyen \nof trade lawyers John Jackson, who coined the term the \u201ctrade constitution\u201d in the \nfollowing sense: \nIt is a very complex mix of economic and governmental policies, \npolitical constraints, and above all . . . an intricate set of constraints \nimposed by a variety of \u201crules\u201d or legal norms in a particular \ninstitutional setting. . . . This \u201cconstitution\u201d imposes different levels \nof constraint on the policy options available to public or private \nleaders.45  \n \nThe current WTO director general Pascal Lamy has stressed the \u201cintegrated and \ndistinctive\u201d nature of the WTO\u2019s legal order and has considered its relationship to the \nlegal systems of other organizations with sensitivity to accusations of being hegemonic.46 \nHowever, he is forthright in stating the WTO\u2019s basic philosophy is that \u201ctrade opening \nobligations are good, and even necessary, to increase people\u2019s standards of living and \nwell-being,\u201d47 and although he points to various means by which the WTO legal system \ncontributes to an overall coherence of international law he also accepts that there are \n\u201ccracks\u201d in that coherence.48  \nOn the other hand, and from a political perspective, Stephen Gill has attacked the \n\u201cnew constitutionalism\u201d\u2014represented not only by the WTO but by other institutions of \nglobal governance\u2014as a \u201cproject of attempting to make transnational liberalism, and if \npossible liberal democratic capitalism, the sole model for future development.\u201d49 Gill \nargues that the global constitutionalization project is well under way and headed in a \nclearly undesirable, neoliberal direction.  \nA detailed study by Deborah Cass, however, suggests that it is inappropriate or \npremature to assume that the constitutionalization of the WTO is a fait accompli.

This would follow the trail \nblazed by the European Court of Justice, which played a transformative role by \ndeveloping doctrines such as supremacy and the direct effect of European law, thereby \nhelping to reconfigure the European Community as more than merely an international \norganization.51 There are, nevertheless, significant limitations on the role a judicial body \ncan play in this respect. This has been demonstrated, clearly, by the EU\u2019s failure to create \nthe political basis for any kind of \u201cconstitution,\u201d leaving it in the institutional limbo of \nmultilevel governance. These limitations are even clearer for the AB, which has been \nkept on a very tight leash by the WTO\u2019s member states; moreover, it lacks the channels \nfor networking with national judiciaries that have been an important element of the ECJ\u2019s \nrelative success.52 Although the AB is, indeed, an international economic court in all but \nname53 and has been gradually developing a coherent body of jurisprudence, it has done \nso under the cloak of a strict formalism, as suggested in the previous section. \nNevertheless, a basis does exist for the AB to enhance both its own and the \nWTO\u2019s legitimacy through the incorporation of human rights norms. As Pauwelyn points \nout, although it may have come as a surprise to some trade negotiators, the general rules \nof international law necessarily apply to the relations between WTO member states, and \nthe WTO agreements form part of that general body of law and thus must be \naccommodated to it in some way.54 Indeed, the AB has often stressed that the reference to \nthe clarification of the WTO agreements \u201cin accordance with the customary rules of \ninterpretation of public international law\u201d requires that the AB apply the principles of the \nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT); these include \u201cany relevant rules of \ninternational law applicable in the relations between the parties\u201d as a pertinent context for \n                                                 \n50 DEBORAH Z.

Hence, the fact that no state has yet invoked human rights \nobligations in a dispute under the WTO (or, for that matter, the GATT) has been taken to \nmean that there is no rationale for taking human rights into account.57  \nEven when non-WTO rules applicable between the parties are invoked, there is \nconsiderable scope for an adjudicator to decide whether to adopt a bold or cautious \napproach to the general question of the relationship between WTO rules and other \ninternational law obligations. From the perspective of the WTO, the preference has been \nfor caution. First, an issue may be construed narrowly so as to confine it to WTO rules. \nThis fits well with the AB\u2019s emphasis on the principle of \u201cjudicial economy,\u201d namely, the \navoidance of pronouncing on issues when doing so is not necessary to resolve the specific \ncomplaint before it. In particular, this means that consideration of non-WTO rules may be \navoided unless they are clearly in conflict with WTO obligations.  \nA different approach has been suggested, notably by the work of the International \nLaw Commission (ILC) on the Fragmentation of International Law.58 This body has \nargued that international law must be regarded as a system, and, hence, that its norms \nmay have relationships which require accommodation through  interpretation, and not \nonly characterized by conflict. Under this approach the interpreter of a treaty has an \nobligation (under article 31[(3][c] of the VCLT) to take into account any relevant rules of \n                                                 \n55 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969), article 31. \n56 WTO staff members have published academic articles on the subject. See, e.g. Hoe Lim, Trade and \nHuman Rights What\u2019s at Issue?, 35 J. WORLD TRADE 275 (2001); Gabrielle Marceau, WTO Dispute \nSettlement and Human Rights, 13 EUR. J. INT\u2019L L. 753 (2002). Although, of course, they stress that the \nviews expressed are strictly their own and do not bind either the WTO secretariat or its member states, it \nis nevertheless interesting to note that article by Hoe Lim, a member of the External Affairs division, \nappeared a year or so after the WTO\u2019s sharp response to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for \nHuman Rights over the so-called \u201cnightmare\u201d report (a report by OHCHR\u2019s Sub-Commission on the \nPromotion and Protection of Minorities that said the WTO rules were based on grossly unfair \nassumptions, reflecting an agenda that served only to promote dominant corporatist interests, and that  \n\u201cfor certain sectors of humanity, particularly the developing countries of the South, the WTO is a \nveritable nightmare.\u201d See Economic and Social Council, Sub-Commission on the Promotion and \nProtection of Human Rights, The Realization of Economic, Social asnd Cultural Rights: Globalization \nand its impact on the full enjoyment of human rights, Preliminary report submitted by J.

A key tactic, then, has been to adopt a strict approach that \nassumes rules are compatible unless it is impossible to comply with both. This has been \nthe view of the AB, which has defined a conflict as \u201ca situation where adherence to one \nprovision will lead to a violation of the other provision.\u201d60  \nLegal indeterminacy leaves considerable latitude in interpreting rules so as to find \nthem compatible. A notable example is the AB\u2019s approach to the application of the \n\u201cprecautionary principle\u201d to food-safety rules. It has rejected arguments that the WTO \nrules should be interpreted in the light of this principle, on the grounds (a) that opinions \ndiffer as to whether the principle is accepted as binding in international law, (b) that it \nwould therefore be \u201cunnecessary, and probably imprudent . . . to take a position on this \nimportant, but abstract, question,\u201d and that (c)  the principle is reflected, in any case, in \nWTO rules.61 Finally, even if a conflict were to be found, there is considerable room for \ndebate as to how it should be resolved under the various accepted treaty-interpretation \nprinciples. In particular, the principle lex specialis derogat legi generali (priority should \nbe given to specific rather than more general rules) is likely to lead to the view that WTO \ntrade rules cannot be overridden by general human rights obligations (unless, of course, \nthe latter are considered fundamental principles of jus cogens). Indeed, even authors who \nbelieve that the AB should apply non-WTO rules, where relevant, tend to accept that in \ncases of conflict the WTO rules should prevail.62  \nThe general approach has been to stress the strictly limited function of the WTO\u2019s \ndispute settlement system\u2014to the point where it is said to be a lex specialis, or a self-\ncontained legal system.63 Some writers concede, nevertheless, that \u201cif the WTO system is \n                                                 \n59 Id. at para. 17. \n60 See Appellate Body Report, Guatemala\u2013Antidumping Investigation Regarding Portland Cement from \nMexico, \u00b6 65, WT\/DS60\/AB\/R (Nov. 5, 1998), indicating that this approach means that a state may be \nunable to exercise a right created under international law subsequent to the WTO agreements, cited in \nPauwelyn, supra note 52, at 551. \n61 Appellate Body Report, European Communities\u2013Measures Concerning Meat and Meat Products, \u00b6 123, \nWT\/DS26\/AB\/R, WT\/DS48\/AB\/R (Feb. 13, 1998) (focusing mainly on the agreement on Sanitary and \nPhytosanitary Measures (SPS)); Panel Report, European Communities\u2013Measures Affecting the Approval \nand Marketing of Biotech Products, \u00b6 7.89, WT\/DS291\/R, WT\/DS292\/R, WT\/DS293\/R (Sept. 29 2006) \n(following this view).  \n62 Lorand Bartels bases this on treating articles 3.2 and 19.2 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding \n(DSU) as a \u201cconflicts\u201d rule, since they specify that DS decisions cannot add to or diminish rights or \nobligations of WTO members, panels and the Appellate Body must apply the WTO rule in case of a \nconflict. Lorand Bartels, Applicable Law in WTO Dispute Settlement Proceedings, 35 J. WORLD TRADE \n499, 499\u2013500 (2001); contra Marceau, supra note 53 (disagreeing with this reasoning but coming to the \nsame conclusion). Pauwelyn, supra note 52, at 564, says that these provisions actually aim at reining in \nthe DS system from expansive or adventurous interpretations of WTO trade rules, but he provides only a \nvery egregious example of a situation in which a panel might be obliged to find a WTO rule invalid, viz., \nif the WTO were to conclude a slave-trading agreement. \n63 Marceau, supra note 53, at 767. \n 18\nlargely self-contained, it is not entirely self-contained\u201d64 in that WTO rules may \nthemselves refer to or incorporate other international law rules.65 This is most notoriously \nthe case for the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights \n(known as the TRIPS agreement), which incorporates (and, therefore, makes binding on \nall WTO members) the major provisions of key intellectual property conventions \nadministered by the World Intellectual Property Organization. Slightly more indirectly, \nothers, such as the Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures and the Technical Barriers to \nTrade agreements, create an obligation for WTO member states to use standards \ndeveloped by relevant international organizations, where they exist.66 Such provisions, in \neffect, make the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system an enforcement body for these other \nareas of international law as well.67 \nThe view of the WTO as partly \u201cself-contained\u201d means that it is a matter for each \nstate to ensure the compatibility of WTO rules with its international obligations, such as \nhuman rights norms, which are not specifically incorporated into the WTO agreements. \n\u201cStates, members of the WTO, remain fully bound and responsible for any violation of \ntheir international law obligations but they cannot use the WTO remedial machinery to \nenforce them.\u201d68 Furthermore, the WTO is considered to be no more than a forum for \nstates, with no executive powers, unlike the IMF and WB, so that neither the organization \nitself nor its secretariat has any direct obligations to ensure the compatibility of its work \nwith human rights obligations.69  \nThis approach suggests a modest role for WTO rules and their enforcement, but \nthe effect is, in fact, quite the opposite; it reinforces their power. The WTO is \nexceptional, indeed unique, among international organizations for the range and \neffectiveness of its compliance mechanisms. Most prominent is the dispute-settlement \nsystem, which offers independent adjudication providing a complainant with a guarantee \nof a decision within a relatively short time frame and the possibility of applying what \namount to trade sanctions if the decision is not complied with. Less visible, but also \neffective, are the more extensive procedural arrangements for supervision of member \nstate compliance through the range of WTO committees. In contrast, the compliance \nmechanisms of international human rights instruments must be considered weak. They \nrely mainly on self-reporting by states and scrutiny by committees of experts.

Crucially, however, \ncompliance depends on \u201cnaming and shaming,\u201d and it lacks the hard economic impact of \nthe WTO\u2019s ultimate sanction of withdrawal of trade advantages. These powers are the \npotential attractions of a more formal inclusion of human rights principles within the \nWTO framework, which are now not available because WTO law is treated in such \nmodest fashion as a lex specialis. \nThe argument for a rights-based WTO \u201cconstitution\u201d has been advanced most \nfervently by Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann, who, for some years and in many repeated \nwritings, has proposed a combination of trade and human rights from a social-market \nperspective based on ordoliberal theory.70 This aims to entrench internationally agreed-\nupon principles to secure the \u201ceffective judicial protection of the transnational exercise of \nindividual rights.\u201d71 This arrangement would enshrine economic rights, such as the \n\u201cfreedom to trade,\u201d as fundamental rights of individuals, legally enforceable through \nnational constitutions in national courts.72 While accepting that freedom of trade should \nalso be accompanied by other human rights\u2014and these, too, should be enshrined in the \nWTO \u201cconstitution\u201d\u2014Petersmann\u2019s emphasis is on rights of private property and market \nfreedoms. However, he goes further and argues that liberal-minded traders should \nwelcome the inclusions of human rights regarding individual freedom, discrimination, \nand equal opportunity, and, additionally, that the mercantilist bias of WTO in favor of \nproducers could be corrected by the protection of competition and of the rights of \u201cthe \ngeneral consumer and citizen interest in liberal trade and . . . human rights.\u201d73 \nAlready, the effect of the institutionalization of the WTO is to constrain national \npolicy choices by embedding broad and stringent international obligations that liberalize \n                                                 \n70 See, e.g., Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann, National Constitutions and International Economic Law, in \nNATIONAL CONSTITUTIONS AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW 3 (Meinhard Hilf & Ernst-Ulrich \nPetersmann eds., Kluwer 1993); Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann, How to Constitutionalize International Law \nand Foreign Policy for the Benefit of Civil Society?, 20 MICH.

WTO enthusiasts argue that this is necessary because \nnational state regulation tends to be protectionist since it is the product of the \u201ccapture\u201d of \nstates by special interests. For example: \nFree trade and democratic government face a common obstacle\u2014the \ninfluence of concentrated interest groups. . . . The WTO and the \ntrade agreements it administers act to restrain protectionist interest \ngroups, thereby promoting both free trade and democracy.74 \n \nThe antidemocratic implications of this view are justified by its roots in a particular \nconcept of liberal democracy, in which state power must be constrained in order to \nsafeguard individual rights and liberties. This constraint would be further reinforced by \nthe strong vision of the constitutionalization of the WTO, as put forward especially by \nPetersmann, who seems to consider all politics\u2014including the WTO\u2019s rules and \nprocedures and its deliberative democratic discourse\u2014as favoring a producer-biased \nmercantilism. It is for this reason that his proposals for entrenching human rights are seen \nas a means of counterbalancing this state of affairs by representing general consumer and \ncitizen interests.75 However, giving individuals, including investors and corporations, \nrights they could enforce directly, in national courts or through the WTO\u2019s dispute-\nsettlement system or both, would further limit the possibilities of collective action \nthrough the state or public bodies. Doing so, moreover, could work to exacerbate \neconomic inequalities by handing a powerful weapon to those whose considerable \neconomic power could be defended in terms of morally underpinned economic rights. \n4. Conclusions \nDoes constitutionalization have a part to play in an emerging system of global \nmetagovernance? Much depends, obviously, on the model of constitutionalism that is \nproposed. As the analysis above has suggested, the model that generally has been put \nforward is essentially a liberal version. This type of constitution is a precommitment \ndevice, aiming to restrict the power of the state and, hence, the will of the people through \na strong form of institutionalization of metaprinciples. Whatever the merits and \nlimitations of this model at the national level, the problems at the international level are \nthat it would further reinforce the principles of economic liberalization forming the main \nplanks of the dominant international organizations (such as the WTO). The dangers of \nimposing constraints on state action based on general principles of individual liberty, in \nthe area of economic regulation, are fairly clear.76  \nYet it is equally clear that the traditional forms of jurisdictional and regulatory \ncoordination of classical liberalism are inadequate in a world that is increasingly and ever \nmore closely integrated economically. Certainly, one of the challenges for \n                                                 \n74 John O. McGinnis & Mark L. Movsesian, The World Trade Constitution, 114 HARV. L.

Press 2008).  \n 21\nconstitutionalism in a world of multilevel governance is that of establishing and \nmaintaining some kind of institutional coherence. This perhaps suggests some kind of \nmultilevel constitutionalism, which, Paolo Carrozza argues, should be viewed as a \ndynamic process of both cooperation and integration between levels.77 However, it is also \nimportant to understand that this is not merely a matter of ensuring functional or \nadministrative coherence. This is certainly difficult enough; the foregoing analysis of \nregulatory networks shows that they emerge in a haphazard and opportunistic way, \nundermining the classical liberal hierarchical order of states, rather than reordering it in a \nmultilevel system. Nor is it sufficient, in my view, to find an appropriate form for the \narticulation of systems of individual fundamental rights. A democratic constitutionalism \nmust also provide appropriate procedures and institutions for the formulation of \ncollective preferences, to guide the actions of states and of all public bodies. The \ndifficulties of doing so in a world that remains culturally and politically diverse, and \nwhere economic inequalities and social divisions have increased, pose probably the \ngreatest challenge for democracy in the twenty-first century.  \n                                                 \n77 Paolo Carrozza, Constitutionalism\u2019s Post-Modern Opening, in THE PARADOX OF CONSTITUTIONALISM : \nCONSTITUENT POWER AND CONSTITUTIONAL FORM 169, 186 (Martin Loughlin & Neil Walker eds., \nOxford Univ.
