From a line-shape analysis of the Doppler-broadened peaks observed in the 10Be\ng spectrum, both the half-lives of states in 10Be and the energies of the b-delayed neutrons feeding those states\nwere obtained. Furthermore, it was possible to determine the excitation energies of the parent states in 11Be\nwith uncertainties comparable to those obtained from neutron spectroscopy experiments. These data suggest\nthat the b decay to the 8.81 MeV state in 11Be occurs in the 9Li core and that one neutron comprising the halo\nof 11Li survives in a halolike configuration after the b-delayed neutron emission from this level.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.70.031302 PACS number(s): 23.20.2g, 23.40.2s, 27.20.1n\nThe concept of loosely bound quantum particles having\nlarge spatial extent, beyond classical limits, is key to under-\nstanding a variety of physical systems [1]. The neutron halo\nof 11Li has been the subject of intense studies since it was\nfirst proposed [2] to explain the abnormally large ratio of the\nmatter-to-charge radius of 11Li [3]. In particular, the study of\nthe b decay of 11Li is expected to shed light on how the weak\ninteraction affects the two neutrons composing the halo.\nPresently [4], it is believed that the two valence neutrons are\neffectively decoupled from the core nucleus s9Lid. As a re-\nsult, if the b decay occurs in the core, the neutrons of the\nhalo could in principle remain unaffected, but would then\n\u201creact\u201d to the fact that the core has changed [5]. In this paper,\nwe discuss the striking possibility that one neutron of the\n11Li halo could survive in a halo configuration through the\nfull b-delayed one-neutron emission process.\nWhile the large 11Li-11Be mass difference sQb\n=20.61 MeVd and the low neutron separation energy in\n11Be sSn=0.503 MeVd open a large number of decay chan-\nnels in the b decay of 11Li (see [6] and references therein),\nmost of the b-decay strength leads to classical channels,\nnamely by b emission to the only bound excited state in 11Be\nat 320 keV (6.3%) and, by b-delayed one-neutron emission\nsbnd (87.6%), to bound excited states in 10Be [7]. The latter\ndecay path has been investigated recently by different experi-\nments using b-g and b-n-g coincidences [6\u20139]. Discrepan-\ncies exist among these experiments. The g-ray intensities of\nthe transitions in 10Be are found to be significantly different,\nwhile some ambiguities arise from the interpretation of the\nneutron spectra [6].\nTo study the b-delayed neutron emission of neutron-rich\nnuclei, it is often necessary to detect both the neutron(s) and\ng rays emitted in order to determine the excitation energies\nof the levels populated in progeny nuclei. However, in the\npresent case, the level structure of 10Be is well known up to\nthe one-neutron separation energy at 6.812 MeV [10,11], and\nthe g peaks resulting from the decay of the 10Be excited\nstates have characteristic Doppler-broadened line shapes due\nto the 10Be recoil induced by the b-delayed neutron emis-\nsion. It is therefore possible, in principle, to make a complete\nanalysis of all the 11Li bn branches that feed the excited\nstates of 10Be through an analysis of the g-ray energy spec-\ntra. In this way, the neutron energy spectrum may be deter-\nmined, complementing and adding to the information ob-\ntained by direct neutron observation. An attempt to analyze\nthese line shapes was made by Fynbo et al. [12] using the g\nspectrum obtained by Borge et al. [7] and again, more re-\ncently, with a set of data obtained at ISOLDE [9].\nThe b decay of 11Li was investigated at TRIUMF-ISAC\n[13] with the 8p spectrometer, an array of 20 Compton-\nsuppressed high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors [14].\n11Li was produced by bombarding a 22 g\/cm2 Ta target with\na 500 MeV proton beam.

A total of 8.1M g\nsingles were collected over a 2.5 day period.\nThe g peaks corresponding to the b and bn decay of 11Li\nare shown in Fig. 1. Besides the known 320 keV transition to\nthe ground state of 11Be, the other g rays labeled on the\nfigure are identified as known transitions in 10Be.\nThe relative efficiency of the array up to 3.4 MeV was\nmeasured to an uncertainty of \u00b12% with calibrated sources\nof 152Eu and 56Co fit using the RadWare package [15]. The\nrelative efficiency at high energies (up to about 8 MeV) was\nobtained from known transitions in the b decay of 11Be [16].\nA GEANT [17] simulation was also developed to predict the\nrelative efficiency of the array at high energies. This simula-\ntion agreed with experiment to about 10% at 6 MeV. The\ng-ray energies and relative intensities observed in the present\nexperiment are summarized in Table I.\nA new g ray was observed at 2896.0s5d keV correspond-\ning to the decay of the 6264 keV, 2\u2212 level in 10Be to the 21\n+\nlevel at 3368 keV. In addition, an unresolved doublet was\nseen at ,5957 keV corresponding to the ground-state decay\nof the known s22\n+\n,1\u2212d doublet in 10Be. Both of these transi-\ntions were also reported recently by Fynbo et al. [9]. The\nrelative intensities observed in the present experiment are a\nfactor 2\u20135 times more precise than all previous data [6\u20139],\nsufficient to resolve previous discrepancies. In general, the\nresults are in agreement with those obtained by Borge et al.\n[7] and Aoi et al. [8]. However, large discrepancies (about a\nfactor of 2) remain for the 2590 and 2812 keV transitions\nreported by Morrissey et al. [6] and the 219 and 5957 keV\ng-ray peaks seen by Fynbo et al. [9].\nThe excitation energies of the 1\u2212, 02\n+\n, and 2\u2212 states in 10Be\nwere determined by fitting the Doppler broadened line\nshapes and correcting for the recoil effect. The energies of\nboth the 1\u2212 and 02\n+ states were found to be about 1 keV\nabove the previous values [10,11], whereas the precision of\nthe energy of the 2\u2212 state was improved by a factor of 10 (see\nTable I).\nA Monte Carlo simulation has been developed to analyze\nthe complex shape of the g lines observed in this experiment.\nThe line shape of a given g peak mainly depends on the\nenergies and relative intensities of all the neutron branches\nfeeding, directly or indirectly, the state from which the g\ntransition arises, and on the lifetimes of the excited state\npopulated in 10Be. The line shape of the peaks can also be\naffected by the angular correlation between the recoil (neu-\ntron) and the g ray [12]. Using the energy loss data com-\nputed in the latest version of SRIM [18], the implantation\nprofile of 11Li atoms in the Al foil was generated and the\nb-delayed one-neutron emission simulated. The recoil was\nassumed to be emitted isotropically in the laboratory frame.\nThe treatment of the recoil escaping the foil, before it stops,\nin the backward angles is included in the simulation, as it\naffects the line shape of the peaks. However, in all cases, the\nrecoil travels only a few micrometers before the g rays are\nemitted and therefore the efficiency of the HPGe detector\narray is not affected. The intrinsic response of the HPGe\ndetectors was approximated with a Gaussian shape, with an\nenergy-dependent width s. No significant asymmetry was\nfound in the data when comparing the g spectra of the indi-\nvidual HPGe detectors. The spectra from all 20 detectors\nwere summed and the analysis was performed on the result-\ning spectrum. To compare the data with the Monte Carlo\nsimulation, the Compton background underneath the peaks\nwas subtracted with the appropriate error propagation. The\nneutron feeding intensities deduced from the line-shape\nanalysis, together with the g-ray intensities, are shown in\nFig. 2.\nNo angular correlation between the recoil and the g ray is\nexpected in the line shapes of the 2812 and 2896 keV tran-\nsitions corresponding to the decay of the 6180 keV, 02\n+ and\n6264 keV, 2\u2212 states, respectively, to the 3368 keV, 21\n+ level.\nThis arises from the fact that the 2\u2212 state is believed to be fed\nmainly by the emission of an ,=0 neutron from a\ns3\/2 ,5 \/2d\u2212 state in 11Be (discussed later in the paper),\nFIG. 1.

The remaining free parameters are the energy Eg of\nthe transition, the half-life T1\/2 of its state of origin, and the\nenergy of the neutron that gives rise to the observed Doppler\nbroadening (or the excitation energy EX of the parent state in\n11Be).\nThe line shapes of both peaks were produced in the Monte\nCarlo simulation as a function of Eg, T1\/2, and EX, and com-\npared to the data using a x2 minimization method. The pro-\ncedure was iterated until the minimum was found for the best\ntriplet ( Eg, EX, T1\/2) that fits the data; acceptable fits (re-\nduced x2 \/n,1) were obtained for both transitions. For the\n6180 keV, 02\n+ state, the half-life was found to be T1\/2\n=870\u00b170sstatd\u00b1160ssystd fs, consistent with the previous\npublished value of 800\n\u2212200\n+300 fs [10,11], for a neutron originat-\ning from an 8.03s7d MeV state in 11Be. Similarly, for the\n6264 keV, 2\u2212 state, the half-life was found to be T1\/2\n=85\u00b16sstatd\u00b110ssystd fs for a neutron originating from an\n8.81s4dMeV state in 11Be. The systematic error on the half-\nlives was estimated by considering a \u00b110% deviation from\nthe SRIM tabulated energy loss of 10Be in aluminum. The best\nfits for the 2812 and 2896 keV transitions are shown in Fig.\n3. No need was found to add any other neutron branch to fit\nthe experimental line shape of either transition. This analysis\nunambiguously confirms the existence of the 8.03 MeV state\nsuggested by Aoi [8] (but not confirmed by Morrissey [6]).\nFurthermore, the uncertainties in the excitation energies of\nthe parent states in 11Be obtained in this experiment are,\nremarkably, comparable to those obtained from neutron spec-\ntroscopy experiments.\nThe analysis of the transitions originating from the\ns1\u2212,22\n+d doublet of states is more complex, because it in-\nvolves the indirect feeding of the 1\u2212 state from the 02\n+ state as\nwell as the direct feeding of one or both states of the doublet.\nWe note that the branching ratios from the 22\n+ and 1\u2212 states to\nthe 21\n+ state were previously found to be .90% and 17\n\u221210\n+6 %\nrespectively [10,11]. The relative intensities of the 2590 and\n5957 keV transitions observed in the present experiment (see\nFig. 2) strongly suggest that most, if not all, of the direct\nfeeding proceeds through the 22\n+ member of the doublet.

For example, adding a direct feeding\ncomponent to the 1\u2212 state provokes a shift in the center of\ngravity of the simulated 2590 keV transition line shape, re-\nsulting in a larger x2. The analysis is, however, limited by the\nrelatively poor quality of the 5957 keV transition line shape,\nwhich would be the most sensitive to a 1\u2212 direct branch. We\ndisagree with the analysis of [9], which assumes that a direct\nfeeding of the 1\u2212 state is responsible for the broad compo-\nnent of the 5957 keV transition. In our case, this broad com-\nponent is attributed to the direct feeding of the 22\n+ state. In\nprinciple, the half-life of the 1\u2212 state could be deduced from\nthe analysis of the sharp component of the 5957 keV transi-\ntion. However, this line shape is dominated by the effect of\nthe half-life of the 02\n+ state. We can only presume that the\nhalf-life of the 1\u2212 state is smaller than a few hundred femto-\nseconds.\nThe parity change necessary to connect the states in 11Be,\nfed by the b decay of 11Li, to the 22\n+ state in 10Be implies the\nemission of an odd-, neutron, most likely ,=1. It is there-\nfore necessary to consider angular correlation effects. Care-\nful analysis of these effects shows a strong correlation of the\nhalf-life with the A2 parameter, as defined in [19], but no\nsignificant correlation with the other free parameters of the\nsimulation: Eg, EX and, in this case, the branching ratios.\nTherefore, the simulations were first performed assuming no\nangular correlation sA2=0d. It was found that the neutron\nbranch from the 8.03 MeV state suggested by [8] cannot\naccount for all the Doppler broadening of the 2590 keV\npeak, resulting in a poor x2 \/n,8. The situation is greatly\nimproved sx2 \/n,1d by adding a neutron branch from the\n8.81 MeV state with an appropriate intensity. The excitation\nenergy of the 1\u2212 state was deduced from the centroid of the\nindirect contribution of the 02\n+ state to the 2590 keV line\nshape. The best fit is obtained with a half-life of T1\/2\n=60.0\u00b11.6sstatd\u00b16.0ssystd fs for the 5958 keV, 22+ state. The\nline shape of the 5957 keV peak was fit using this half-life\nand neutron branching ratios determined for the 22\n+\u219221+ tran-\nsition together with the intensities of the 22\n+\u219201+ and 1\u2212\n\u219201+ transitions as free parameters. The best overall fit was\nobtained for intensities corresponding to branching ratios of\n10\u00b13% and 65\u00b115%, respectively in agreement with previ-\nously measured values ,10% and 83\n\u22126\n+10% [10,11]. The best\nfits (with A2=0) for both transitions and the individual con-\ntributions of the three separate components to the line\nshapes, are shown in Fig. 3. At this point, we note that the\n8.03 MeV state in 11Be is likely a 3\/2\u2212 state as it feeds both\nthe 02\n+ and the 22\n+ states, which could be reached by an ,\n=1 neutron. A 1\/2\u2212 or 5 \/2\u2212 assignment is unlikely since it\nwould require an ,=3 neutron to reach one of the two states.\nThe effect of the n-g angular correlation was studied us-\ning the half-life and A2 value as the only free parameters.\nThe range of A2 values corresponding to a mixed E2\/M1\ntransition s\u22120.68,A2,0.68d was obtained from [19]. As-\nsuming the worst case scenario that both neutron decay\nbranches have angular correlations with the same sign of A2,\nthe minimum x2 \/n=0.9 is obtained for A2=0\u00b10.07 corre-\nsponding to a half-life of 60\u00b110 fs (stat1syst). We note that\nalthough this range of A2 values is consistent with that of a\npure E2 transition, this possibility can be ruled out because\nof the corresponding large B(E2; 22\n+\u219221+) of about 57 Weis-\nskopf units (W.u.).\nThe remainder of this paper focuses on the interpretation\nof the information obtained for the 2\u2212 and 22\n+ states in 10Be\nand discusses the nature of the 8.81 MeV state in 11Be. The\nlikely molecularlike structures of the four excited states in\n10Be s22\n+\n,1\u2212 ,02\n+\n,2\u2212d lying just below the 9Be+n and 6He+a\nthresholds have recently been investigated in various theoret-\nical studies [20\u201323]. The dominant structure of the two states\ns22\n+\n,2\u2212d fed by the neutron decay from the 8.81 MeV state in\n11Be is found to be 9Be ^ 1s1\/2 for the 2\u2212 state and 9Be\n^ 0p1\/2 for the 22\n+ state, i.e., a valence neutron, in a relative s\nor p wave, loosely bound to a 9Be core, possibly in a halolike\nspatial distribution [21]. Recent work on the one-neutron\nknockout reaction (11Be, 10Be) has suggested that the 2\u2212 state\nis populated when a p3\/2 neutron is removed from the 10Be\ncore, leaving the 1s1\/2 valence (halo) neutron intact [24],\nsuggesting that this state in 10Be might be an excited state\nhalo as proposed by [25]. Indeed, it shows remarkable simi-\nlarity to the ground state of 11Be with a single valence neu-\ntron in a 1s1\/2 state bound by about 0.5 MeV to a 9Be s10Bed\ncore. Can we understand the structure of the 22\n+ and 2\u2212 states\nin 10Be in light of our b-decay study of 11Li?\nIt has been suggested [5] that if the b decay of a halo\nnucleus takes place within its core then it is possible for the\nhalo wave function to retain its features after the b decay,\neven though the core may now have a rather different struc-\nture. The excitation energy of such a daughter state should\nthen be roughly equal to the difference in Q values of the\ndecaying halo nucleus and its core. The 8.81 MeV state in\n11Be is a strong candidate for just such a state and would thus\nhave a large overlap with a 9Be+n+n configuration. Support\nfor this is provided from studies of the b-delayed two-\nneutron decay of 11Li, which is suggested to originate in part\nfrom this state [26,27]. In addition, this state is strongly\npopulated in 2n-transfer reactions (see [28] and references\ntherein). It is, however, clearly in contradiction to the inter-\npretation [20,28] that this state is part of a rotational band\nwith a spin of 9 \/2\u2212. The 9Be core cannot be in its ground\nstate, because this state lies 1.49 MeV above the 9Be+2n\nthreshold. The 8.81 MeV state can however be built around a\n9Be excited state plus two neutrons coupled to spin 0,\nnamely the 5\/2\u2212 state located 2.429 MeV above the ground\nstate of 9Be. The Qb of 11Li\u2212 11Be s8.81 MeVd and 9Li\n\u2212\n9Be s5\/2\u2212d are only 635 keV apart. A 5\/2\u2212 spin assignment\nfor the 8.81 MeV state would explain why we do not observe\nany decay of the 8.81 MeV state in 11Be to the 1\u2212 state in\n10Be, which is believed to have a similar structure to the 2\u2212\nstate [21]. Instead, we observe its decay via single-neutron\nemission to just two bound excited states in 10Be: the 22+ and\nthe 2\u2212 states with 9Be+n separation energies of 854 and\n548 keV, respectively. In each case, we suggest it is one of\nthe original 11Li halo neutrons (55(10)% s0p1\/2d2, 45(10)%\ns1s1\/2d2 [29]) that is emitted from the 8.81 MeV state in 11Be,\nwith the surviving valence neutron remaining in its 0p1\/2 or\n1s1\/2 state and contributing to the structure of the 22\n+ or 2\u2212\nstates in 10Be, respectively. Indeed, shell model calculations\nby Brown [30] show that the 22\n+ and 2\u2212 states have a strong\nSARAZIN et al.

Note that we here neglect a possible (small)\nsd5\/2d2 component in the 11Li wave function, which could\nalso populate the 2\u2212 state via ,=2 neutron emission.\nThe possible halolike structure of the 2\u2212 state in 10Be\ndeserves special mention here as it is the best candidate to\ndate of an excited neutron halo state. Our half-life measure-\nment of T1\/2=85\u00b112 fs corresponds to an experimental\nBsE1;2\u2212\u219221+d=7.7310\u22124 W.u. This value disagrees with\nthe (preliminary) theoretical estimate of 0.02 W.u. obtained\nwithin a microscopic four cluster sa+a+n+nd model using\nthe resonating group method [31]. However, such a discrep-\nancy is not surprising given the weakness of this transition.\nThe theoretical value depends very sensitively on details of\nthe wave functions of the two states involved; further theo-\nretical work is in progress.\nIn summary, we have investigated the b decay of 11Li\nthrough the study of the Doppler-broadened transitions in\n10Be observed in the b-delayed one-neutron emission of 11Li.\nFrom the line-shape analysis of these transitions, we deter-\nmined both the energies of the states in 11Be feeding the\nexcited states in 10Be and also the half-life of some of these\n10Be excited states. We also find that the b decay of 11Li to\nthe 8.81 MeV state in 11Be is likely to occur in the 9Li core,\nleaving the two original halo neutrons of 11Li unperturbed.\nThe 8.81 MeV state is interpreted as a 9Be s5\/2\u2212d core plus\nthe two surviving halo neutrons coupled to spin 0. The one-\nneutron emission paths from the 8.81 MeV state in 11Be are\nconsistent with the emission of one of the two halo neutrons\nand provide a supporting evidence that the 22\n+ and 2\u2212 states in\n10Be have a halolike character, as predicted by various theo-\nretical models.\nThis work was partially supported by the Natural Sciences\nand Engineering Research Council of Canada and the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy through Grant\/Contract Nos.
