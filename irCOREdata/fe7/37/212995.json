Underlying the decisions of July and August\n1914 was a hard core of calculation, based on the advice to governments that\nthe fighting would be fierce but short, and that its political and economic\nrepercussions could be contained. In addition, because the two sides were\ncloser to military equivalence than in previous crises, both could believe that\nthey had a reasonable prospect of victory. But such equivalence, given the\nweapons technology of the day, might also deny either coalition a speedy,\nsurgical triumph. And it is from the prolongation of the war as well as its\ninception \u2014 from its not being over by Christmas \u2014 that its historical\nimportance derives. Among the consequences were eight million dead, and the\ndislocation of the Western economic system. Without the war it is unlikely that\neither Lenin, or Mussolini, or even Hitler, would have come to office. As far\nas such things can be said with certainty, the First World War was a\nprecondition of the Second. A four-month rather than a four-year con-\nflagration would have had other, now unknowable, consequences. It would\nnot, presumably, have had these.\nNone of this is said to denigrate research into the origins of the war. But to\nexplain its outbreak without explaining its continuation is to leave half the\nhistorical problem unresolved. There are two very general reasons why the\nwar went on in circumstances that seemingly invalidated every assumption\nprevalent at its outset. The first is that the process was one of incremental,\nsequential decision. The choice facing, say, the British leaders after the\n* I should like to thank Karen Partridge for typing this article.\n1\n Many of the points referred to in this article are discussed more fully in my book The First\nWorld War and international politics (Oxford, 1988) and my earlier French war aims against Germany,\nigif-igig (Oxford, 1982).

It was rather\nwhether to approve the next offensive or explore the latest peace initiative, in\nthe knowledge that that offensive might yield breakthrough and that to\nnegotiate might mean renouncing gains that a relatively small additional\neffort could bring in reach. And it was easier to sacrifice the second than the\nfirst 50,000 lives, especially if not to do so meant that those first 50,000 had\ncertainly been lost in vain. Only afterwards, and with hindsight, could the\ncumulative cost of victory become evident.\nThe second general reason is more obvious: that the war became a\nstalemate. But this was a triple, self-reinforcing stalemate, in domestic politics\nand in diplomacy as well as in military operations. This article will deal\nprimarily with the diplomatic variable, but it cannot be understood in\nisolation from the other two. Between 1914 and 1917 the bloodletting could be\nended neither by victory, nor by revolution, nor by compromise. The impasse\non the Western front was paralleled by the absence of decision in the more\nmobile theatres of war. In contrast with the Second World War, it was not\nuntil the last few weeks, after the turning-point of July-August 1918, that the\nultimate outcome became certain, and until then neither side had reason to\nabandon hope of a military victory. Partly for this reason, for public opinion\nas for governments the 'short-war illusion'2 of July 1914 continued to sustain\nmorale. Until 1917 the reports of the French prefect of the Yonne, for example,\nsuggested a rise in civilian expectations before each great attack.3 Within all\nthe great powers until the Bolshevik revolution, the political forces that\naccepted the cost of fighting on prevailed over those that challenged it. The\ncircumstances of the war's outbreak enabled all the principal belligerents to\nrepresentthe struggle as defensive, provoked by aggression from the other side.\nIt must continue in order to prevent such aggression from happening again.\nAnd public morale drew part of its resilience from the long germination of\nnational consciousness before 1914. The pre-war generation was still a time of\nnation-building, through urbanization, telegraphs and railways, universal\nconscription, and compulsory elementary schools. Precisely because this had\ngone furthest in Western Europe, it was from the east \u2014 from the under-\ndeveloped multi-national empires of Russia and Austria-Hungary \u2014 that the\nchallenge of 1917 to domestic cohesion and alliance solidarity predominantly\ncame.4\nWe may now return to the diplomatic variable. The principal attempts to\nend the war by compromise were concentrated between the central powers'\nand the American peace notes of December 1916 and the treaty of Brest-\nLitovsk in March 1918. The military and domestic context helps explain why\nthis was so. Since the trench stalemate had become established, the allies had\n2\n Cf. L. L.

The\nGermans, conversely, launched no major land offensive between the battle of\nVerdun and March 1918, and by the middle of 1917 it was becoming clear\nthat their unrestricted submarine offensive would be unable to starve the\nBritish out before American power was brought to bear. The summer and\nautumn of 1917 therefore had many of the characteristics of a broken-backed\nwar. This did not mean that either side had lost all hope of victory; but both\nwere near exhaustion and the prospects for a purely military solution had\nnever seemed so bleak. In the balance between military and diplomatic\nmethods of gaining political objectives, diplomacy acquired new prominence.\nOnly Russia's separate armistice in December 1917 made possible a new\nattempt to break the log-jam by military operations, and led to diplomacy\nagain being relegated. It was also between the two Russian revolutions that\ndomestic consensus right across Europe came under unprecedented strain\nbecause of growing support for the liberal and socialist left. The rest of this\narticle will therefore focus on the months from March to November 1917,\nwhen diplomatic activity was at its height and the prospects for a compromise\nseemed greatest. It will pursue four themes: the Austro-Hungarian search for\npeace within the central powers' camp; the Russian search within that of the\nallies; the contacts within the Western European triangle of Germany, France\nand Britain; and the European implications of American policy.\nII\nAs with Russia, if less dramatically, the Habsburg empire's new diplomatic\nassertiveness began with a shift in the domestic political balance. The emperor\nKarl came to the throne in December 1916. Both he and his new foreign\nminister, Czernin, were nervous activists, alarmed by Austria-Hungary's\npredicament, and anxious to terminate a policy of drift. Both were therefore\nwilling to circumscribe the monarchy's war aims, and to. sound out the enemy.\nCzernin told a crown council on 12 January that he still wished to modify the\nfrontiers with Rumania, Serbia and Montenegro, but he placed most emphasis\nsimply on maintaining existing Habsburg possessions.5 Karl himself was\nprimarily responsible for the exchanges conducted via Prince Sixte de\nBourbon between December 1916 and June 1917, which were the most\nextended Austrian contact with the allies. In a letter of 24 March, conveyed\nby Sixte to the French leaders, he promised that Serbia could regain its\nsovereignty and win access to the Adriatic, on the condition only of\nsuppressing anti-Habsburg agitation. He also favoured restoring Belgium's\nindependence and undertook to support 'by every means' France's 'just\n6\n G. Ritter, The sword and the sceptre: the problem of militarism in Germany (4 vols., London,\n. 385-\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n68 DAVID STEVENSON\nclaims relative to Alsace and Lorraine'.6 This was apparently to approve the\nmost important of the publicly acknowledged British and French war aims.\nAnd although the allies' note of 10 January 1917 to the American president\nhad spoken of'the liberation of the Italians, the Slavs, the Rumanians, and\nthe Czecho-Slovaks [sic] from foreign domination', in reality this did not\nreflect their policy.7 Lloyd George, the British prime minister, indicated to the\nAmericans in February that Austria-Hungary could keep Bohemia and that\nhe would welcome a separate peace with Vienna.8 Moreover, during the Sixte\nnegotiations, the French president, Poincare, and Jules Cambon, the secretary-\ngeneral of the Quai d'Orsay, offered the Austrians not only survival but also\nterritorial expansion, in the shape of Silesia and Bavaria.9 There appeared to\nbe no direct contradiction between Austro-Hungarian and Franco-British war\naims.\nIn a way characteristic of 1917, the Sixte initiative none the less failed at two\nlevels: over a specific territorial issue and over the broader obstacle of alliance\ncohesion. The territorial issue was Italy's claim to the Trentino, the South\nTyrol, and much of Istria and Dalmatia, to which the other Allies had pledged\nsupport in the 1915 treaty of London in return for Italy's entry into the war.\nKarl and Czernin were contemptuous of the Italians' war effort, and although\nin the final stages of the initiative Karl grudgingly offered to exchange the\nTrentino for compensation elsewhere,10 this was less than Vienna had\npromised Italy in 1915 simply for remaining neutral. Conversely, the Italian\nforeign minister, Sonnino, stood by the treaty of London obligations when he\nmet Lloyd George and the French prime minister, Ribot, on 14 April at Saint-\nJean-de-Maurienne. Lloyd George's offer of the Turkish province of Smyrna\nfailed to move him. And although at this stage Lloyd George and Ribot could\nnot disclose Karl's personal involvement, Sonnino remained unalterable when\nin July Ribot showed him all the correspondence from the affair.11 After Saint-\nJean-de-Maurienne, therefore, the contact became increasingly an attempt by\neach side to sow dissension in the opposite camp.\nAnd this raises the second, broader problem. Whatever Lloyd George's\nexasperation with Sonnino, he did not follow up the Smyrna offer by applying\npressure. And Ribot feared that if British and French good faith were\ncompromised, not only Italy might be lost but also Serbia and Rumania and\npossibly Russia as well.12 But if the British and French felt unable to throw\nover the Italians, this gave Karl little incentive to disengage from Germany,\n6\n Prince Sixte de Bourbon, L'Offre de paix se'pare'e de CAutriche, 5 dec. igi6~i2 oct. igiy (Paris,\n1920), pp. 96-8.\n' For this declaration, J .

British\npolicy in February 1917 was still to refuse contact with the Germans\nthemselves or to discuss a general settlement with the central powers.13 And\nthe French offers of Silesia and Bavaria made no sense unless Vienna were to\nbreak loose from its partner and become an independent Central European\ncounterweight. But Sixte had overstated Austria-Hungary's separatist\ntendencies in his representations to the allies. True, Karl had told him that if\nGermany rejected 'just and equitable' terms (which presumably meant\nabandoning Belgium and Alsace-Lorraine) he would ultimately have to make\na separate peace; Czernin similarly said that if Germany blocked a\n'reasonable' settlement, Austria-Hungary would have to break up the\nalliance. But whereas the emperor expressed this willingness in writing,\nCzernin's memoranda during the Sixte initiative ruled out a separate peace,\nand during the foreign minister's contacts with the allies in 1917 he\nconsistently offered only a general settlement.14 This implied a willingness to\nbe the allies' spokesman within the central powers' camp, and even to threaten\nseparate action, but not to act on the threat. If Karl was willing to do more\n\u2014 and he kept Czernin very imperfectly informed during the Sixte affair \u2014 he\nstill kept on a minister in whom he did not fully place his confidence, and this\nindicates the difficulties he would have faced in trying to break with Germany.\nTo have done so would have tested his authority to the limit, and his dilemma\nis captured in a letter of 15 May to Czernin. A dramatic German victory, he\nfelt, would be disastrous for Austria-Hungary, which must pursue a settlement\nbased on the status quo; but it could not abandon the German alliance.18 The\nHabsburg monarchy's approaches to the allies must therefore be seen as one\nprong of a dual strategy that included also a diplomatic offensive to soften up\nits stronger partner. But this was not a simple quest for peace at any price, and\nwhen Karl and Czernin failed to win the moderation of Germany's Western\nEuropean war aims that was essential for a general compromise, they still drew\nback from the precipice of a separate negotiation.\nThe diplomatic offensive was pursued through discussions with the German\ngovernment and through a broader ' paradiplomacy' designed to mobilize\nGerman opinion.18 But the more orthodox methods were tried first. At a\nmeeting with the German chancellor, Bethmann Hollweg, on 16-17 March,\nCzernin pleaded that Austria-Hungary was ' at the end of her strength' and\nagreement must be reached on peace conditions. So far from sacrificing\nwhatever was necessary in order to gain a cease-fire before disaster, however,\n13\n V. H.

Thus he proposed that if Germany gained peace on the basis of the\nstatus quo ante, Austria-Hungary should obtain the same (which implied\ntrading allied territories conquered by the Germans for the restoration of those\nlost by Vienna). But if Germany did better, so should Austria-Hungary, and\nthis meant particularly the larger share in a partition of Rumania. At a further\nmeeting ten days later, the two sides indeed concurred that the minimum\nacceptable peace was the status quo ante in Western and Eastern Europe, but\nif the outcome were more favourable, the Habsburgs would expand primarily\nin Rumania, and Germany in Poland and the Baltic provinces. Bethmann\nappeared resigned to not regaining all of Germany's colonies, and to\nsafeguarding its position in Belgium mainly through a railway and customs\nunion, which was much less than had previously been thought necessary.\nWhen Karl met Wilhelm II at Homburg on 3 April, however, Czernin tried\nto go further, suggesting that Austria-Hungary should cede its province of\nGalicia to a German-dominated kingdom of Poland, in return for Germany\nceding to France all of Alsace-Lorraine. German rejection of this over-\ningenious arrangement forced him to change his tactics from offers of\ninducements to attempts at coercion.17\nThe problem, as the Austrians well knew, was that Bethmann faced\nconflicting pressure from the high command of Hindenburg and Ludendorff,\nor OHL, which had acquired the characteristics of a sovereign entity within\nthe German government. Bethmann's preference since November 1914 had\nbeen for flexibility and vagueness over war aims, to permit him to follow up\nevery opportunity to lessen Germany's enemies by bringing one or more of\nthem to a separate peace. Hindenburg and Ludendorff, more optimistic,\nadvocated total victory and by military rather than diplomatic means. They\nopposed territorial sacrifices made to split the allies that would compromise\nGermany's prospects in what they supposed was an inevitable future war. Co-\nordination between these viewpoints was the task of Wilhelm, who instinctively\nsympathized with military and naval thinking about war aims, and feared a\nconfrontation with the victors of Tannenberg, whose popular prestige rivalled\nhis own. Thus he overrode Bethmann's objections to a closer definition when\nin April 1917 Hindenburg argued that the fall of the tsar had brought peace\ncloser and that Germany must decide on its objectives before entering\ndiscussions with its allies.18 By implication, Hindenburg wished to go beyond\nthe ambitious war aims already negotiated between the military and civilian\nleaders before the central powers' abortive peace note of December 1916. The\nKreuznach programme duly emerged from a new military-civilian conference\non 23 April. It was formidable. In the Baltic, Germany would annex Courland\n17\n Minutes on conferences of 16 and 26 Mar. 1917, S & G, n, docs. 20, 33.

It would also annex extensively from the\nnominally independent Poland that the central powers had pledged themselves\nto in November 1916 and that in practice was intended for German political,\neconomic and military domination. In the west it would annex Arlon,\nLuxemburg, and the main French iron-ore field, Longwy-Briey. Britain must\naccept German occupation of and transit rights across a disarmed Belgium in\nrailway union with the Reich. The Flanders coast, wanted by the navy for U-\nboat bases, and Liege would be held in perpetuity or on a ninety-nine-year\nlease.19 It is true that Wilhelm, in authorizing the conference, had\ndistinguished between what was desirable and what was realizable, but his\npersonal minimum aims differed little from the Kreuznach programme.20 So\nalthough Bethmann commented that these 'fantasies' would have meaning\nonly in the improbable contingency of Germany being able to dictate its\nterms, and that he would continue regardless to seek a separate peace, he was\nvulnerable and isolated.21 And conventional intergovernmental discussions\nwere therefore unlikely to achieve Czernin's objective of moderating German\naims.\nIn April and May the Austrians duly attempted shock tactics. Czernin\nobliged OHL with the information that he found Bethmann impossible to\nwork with. He appeared to welcome the German Social Democratic Party's\n(SPD's) opposition to annexations. On 12 April he sent to Wilhelm via Karl\nan apocalyptic memorandum predicting revolution against both dynasties if\ntheir countries had to undergo another winter of war.22 None of this cut much\nice. Wilhelm doubted that revolution was likely in Germany; and Bethmann,\nwho was not fighting for his independence from LudendorfF in order to\nsurrender it to Czernin, replied that precisely submission to the enemy would\nbe most likely to bring the monarchies down.23 At a German-Austrian\nconference, again held at Kreuznach on 17-18 May, Czernin effectively called\nhis paradiplomacy off, partly because the Dual Monarchy's position had now\nimproved. A new agreement again provided that Austria-Hungary would\nexpand primarily in Rumania, but Germany would have a predominant share\nin owing and exploiting the Rumanian oil industry and railways and the local\nDanube shipping. This bone without a marrow was little compensation for\nCzernin's failure to manoeuvre Germany into concessions in Western Europe,\nwhich was omitted from the document.24 But even Bethmann was not\nprepared for complete renunciation in Belgium, and he remained committed\nto annexing Longwy-Briey and to resisting more than token border transfers\n'* Griinau to Bethmann, 24 Apr. 1917, ibid. doc. 87.\n40\n Grunau to Auswartiges Amt, 13 May 1917, ibid. doc. 115.\n11\n Bethmann minute, 25 Apr. 1917, ibid. doc. 87.

If the path was blocked towards a general peace, however, the\nAustrians had had little allied encouragement to venture on a separate one.\nThe only remaining possibility of an accommodation in the central powers'\nposition lay with a change in the German domestic balance.\nIn July 1917, precisely this seemed to occur, in the shape of Bethmann\nHollweg's replacement as chancellor by Michaelis at the same time as the\nReichstag passed a 'peace resolution'. But, if anything, these events marked\na hardening of German policy. Matthias Erzberger of the pivotal Catholic\nCentre Party set the crisis going with a speech to the Reichstag main\ncommittee that gave a bleak depiction of Germany's prospects and called for\na resolution against an annexationist peace. Erzberger had liaised earlier with\nKarl and Czernin and received a copy of their 12 April memorandum to\nWilhelm, and to this limited extent the July crisis was a belated consequence\nof Czernin's paradiplomacy. But Erzberger's hope, like that of the Austrian\nforeign minister, was for a general peace that somehow would not entail defeat\nfor the central powers and might even improve their position.25 And although\nthe Reichstag resolution condemned 'forced territorial acquisitions', its\nwording permitted indirect expansion through nominally independent buffer\nstates.28 The majority of the deputies who supported it could therefore later\napprove without contradiction the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which deprived the\nformer Russian empire of one third of its population while annexing none of\nthe territory in question to Germany. The day after the resolution was passed,\nErzberger recommended to Michaelis that Lithuania should become a\nnominally independent duchy with Wilhelm as its sovereign, in customs union\nwith Germany. Alsace-Lorraine should become autonomous but remain\nunder German sovereignty, and even Longwy-Briey might be obtainable\nwithin the resolution as part of an exchange.27\nIn any case, the Reichstag no more controlled the executive after July than\nbefore. The decisive impetus for Bethmann's departure was not dissatisfaction\nin the legislature but a threat from Hindenburg and Ludendorff to resign if the\nchancellor did not go. Michaelis was not a puppet of OHL, but neither was\nhe selected by the Reichstag, and he proved to be more conservative than his\npredecessor in domestic and foreign affairs. He accepted the peace resolution\nonly 'as I understand it', and told the crown prince that he could now 'make\nany peace that one likes under its terms'.28 At a third Kreuznach meeting on\n9 August he agreed with OHL on even more draconian war aims than those\nof 23 April, including a possible German satellite in the Ukraine. Although\nCzernin had renewed his offer to abandon Galicia to a German-dominated\nPoland if Germany would make sacrifices in Alsace-Lorraine, Michaelis\ninformed him on 14-15 August that Germany could make no important\n26\n K .

Yet\nif this was one part of the 1917 conundrum, the allies, also, resisted either a\nbreach in their diplomatic solidarity or a sufficient reduction in their war aims\nto permit discussion of a general peace. It is necessary to consider why, in spite\nof the impact of the Russian revolution, this was so.\nI l l\nSuch authority as remained in Russia after the abdication of Nicholas II was\nt divided initially between the provisional government under Prince Lvov,\ncomposed mainly of former Duma members, and the Petrograd soviet of\nworkers' and soldiers' deputies. Neither gave absolute priority to domestic\nsurvival at the expense of international commitments. The all-Russian\ncongress of Soviets on 11 April appealed to the peoples of the world to press\ntheir leaders to abandon annexations and indemnities, but pledged its support\nto the Russian war effort.30 The foreign policy of the Petrograd soviet was\nmoulded by the so-called Siberian Zimmerwaldians, who wanted an\ninternational socialist conference and pressure on Russia's allies to scale down\ntheir aims, but accepted that socialists could support a democratic, non-\nannexationist war. This broadly became official policy after representatives of\nthe soviet entered the government in May, and Tereshchenko replaced\nMiliukov as foreign minister.31 Miliukov, indeed, had remained loyal to the\ntsarist aim of annexing Constantinople, and even Tereshchenko may have\nhankered after some form of control over the straits, as well as gains from the\nTurks in Armenia.32 Lvov disarmingly informed the British ambassador that\nthe phrase ' peace without annexations' was open to whatever interpretation\nthe allies placed on it, and his successor, Kerensky, desired at least that the\nstraits should be internationalized.33 Despite these equivocations, however,\nand with the major exception of Poland, the provisional government was as\nnear as any of the belligerents to fighting a purely defensive war in order to\nregain its 1914 frontiers. It came to occupy a position in the allied camp\nanalogous to that of Austria-Hungary among the central powers, and it too\nengaged simultaneously in a diplomatic and paradiplomatic offensive against\nits partners' war aims and in peace contacts with the enemy.\nThese contacts foundered on the usual reefs of rival territorial claims and\ncoalition solidarity. The most significant of them were the Erzberger-\n29\n Minutes of Austro-German conference of 1 Aug. 1917; Lersner to Kiihlmann, isAug. 1917;\nMichaelis to Czernin, 17 Aug. 1917, S & G, n, docs. 181, 207, 211.\n80\n B & K, n, doc. 948.\n31\n R.

The two\nparticipants agreed on armistice conditions and on a peace that would restore\nRussia's pre-war frontier, although subject to extensive 'corrections' and to a\nplebiscite (expected by Erzberger to favour the central powers) in Poland.\nThey could get this far only because neither man fully represented his\ngovernment. Kolyschko's activities were acquiesced in by some members of\nthe Russian cabinet, but others accused him of being a German agent.\nErzberger went to Stockholm with Bethmann's sanction, but exceeded his\ninstructions, which were only to listen. And by discussing not only a peace but\nalso an armistice, he gave a legitimate pretext for intervention by Ludendorff,\nwho sent his own representative to warn Kolyschko that OHL would never\naccept such moderate terms.34 The foreign ministry and the high command\nagreed on 29 April that any cease-fire must give Germany ' frontier corrections'\nin Courland and Lithuania, and that Poland must be independent. New\nconditions approved by Bethmann in May specified that Poland must 'lean'\ntowards the central powers and provided for the ' Anschluss' of Courland and\nLithuania with Germany.35 The German civilian and military positions were\nnow aligned, and in the following month contacts with the provisional\ngovernment ended.\nThe territorial stumbling blocks were therefore Courland, Lithuania and,\nespecially, Poland. Although Bethmann had publicly undertaken in April\n1916 not to retrocede Germany's conquests in the Baltic provinces,36 there\nwas still some flexibility in the German position here. But he himself\nconsidered in retrospect the November 1916 proclamation of independence for\nRussian Poland to be the one war-aims commitment of his chancellorship by\nwhich Germany was irrevocably bound.37 Even if the country remained a\nsubject of Austro-German dispute, there was no doubt of its destiny as a\nsatellite of the central powers. Conversely, the essential tsarist war aim, apart\nfrom annexing Constantinople, had been to incorporate the central powers'\nPolish provinces into a reunited Poland in personal union with the Russian\nempire that would constitute a buffer state under Russian, rather than hostile,\ndomination.38 The provisional government declared that Poland should be\nindependent, but in 'free military alliance' with Russia, and remained\ncommitted to absorbing into it the Habsburg and Hohenzollern Polish\nprovinces.39\nBeyond this loomed a still more intractable issue. Kolyschko went to\nStockholm to seek a general peace; Erzberger a separate one. Both the\n34\n Epstein, Erzberger, p p . 166-78 , for a genera l account .

Like Czernin, the provisional government failed to move its\npartners either by intergovernmental contacts or by paradiplomacy, but its\nefforts under the first head were half-hearted anyway. It began by issuing a\nwar-aims declaration and forwarding this to the other allies for comment. The\ndocument was a compromise between Miliukov's and the Petrograd Soviet's\nviews. It denied that Russia wished to dominate other countries, or seize their\nnational possessions; but it would fight on for a peace based on self-\ndetermination, and honour its alliance obligations. The British replied that\nthey were not fighting a war of conquest, although they welcomed Russia's\nintention to liberate all parts of Poland. The French said that they were\nfighting for Alsace-Lorraine, for 'reparatory indemnities', and guarantees\nagainst renewed enemy provocation, and that only victory could bring a\nlasting peace.40 But both governments were willing to talk about their war\naims, and on this unpromising basis Tereshchenko on 13 June proposed an\ninter-allied conference to revise the coalition's war-aims agreements. But by\nexpressly excluding from this the September 1914 pact of London and its\nrenunciation of separate negotiations he deprived himself in advance of his\nmain bargaining weapon. He never received a reply, and in July suggested\nhimself that the conference should be postponed.41 He had hoped his partners\nwould be more accommodating if Russia revived its military effort, but with\nthe defeat of the summer ' Kerensky offensive' this prospect also evaporated.\nHis one remaining card was publicity, and he suggested to the French that the\nMarch 1917 'Doumergue agreement', exchanging a free hand for Russia on\nits western borders for French annexation of the Saarland and for a system of\nbuffer states on the left bank of the Rhine, should be made known. Ribot\ncountered by proposing to link this with the publication of the March 1915\ninter-allied agreement promising Russia Constantinople, and Tereshchenko\nbacked away. By the time the idea of a war-aims conference was relaunched\nin the autumn, the provisional government was in its death throes.42\nThe Russians therefore lacked the strength and single-mindedness to impose\na general war-aims reduction on the allies through diplomatic channels. But\na more serious challenge was presented by the Petrograd Soviet's support for\nan international socialist conference at Stockholm. Since 1914, European\nsocialism had become fragmented into three broad ideological tendencies. The\npatriotic Right supported the national war efforts (though not necessarily\n40\n For the declaration (forwarded on 18 Apr.) and the British, French and Italian replies\n(26-27 Apr.), B & K, 11, docs. 909, 964, 972-4.\n41\n Tereshchenko note of 13 June 1917; Tereshchenko to Bakhmetev, 28 July 1917, ibid,\ndocs. 986, 989.\n42\n Sevastopoulo to Jules Cambon, 5 July 1917; Ribot to Noulens, 13 Aug. 1917; Noulens to\nRibot, 17 Aug. 1917, AMAE A 'Paix' (164).

It\nincluded a majority of the SPD, the Labour party, and the French socialists,\nthe SFIO. By 1917 it was rivalled by the Centre, or 'minority', who mustered\nnearly half the vote in SFIO congresses, split off from the SPD as the\nIndependent Socialists, and included most of the Italian PSI as well as the\nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries in Russia. The centrists opposed\nannexations, refused to vote war credits, and wanted to revive the pre-war\nSecond International, although they acted by constitutional means. Finally,\nthe revolutionary Left, represented principally by Lenin and the Bolsheviks,\nwished to transform the conflict into an international civil war, and to\nconstruct a new international summit organization. But in most of Europe the\nCentre gained more than the Left from the socialist resurgence in 1917, and\nit was the Centre that launched the Stockholm appeal, beginning with an\ninvitation in April by the neutral socialists in the Bureau of the Second\nInternational. The Petrograd soviet made a parallel proposal on 15 May, and\njoined forces with the neutrals in a combined invitation on 11 July. By doing\nso it gave Stockholm allied as well as neutral socialist backing, and, given the\nprestige that the Russian revolutionaries enjoyed, the Right was now liable to\nshift into the Centrist camp over the issue.43\nIn the event, although elements of the revolutionary Left met at Stockholm\nin September, the more broadly representative conference initially envisaged\nnever convened. The German and Austro-Hungarian governments were\nwilling to let their socialists attend, and proximate responsibility for the\nstillbirth of the conference therefore lay with the allies. The American\npresident thought such a gathering 'likely to make a deal of mischief', and\nwithheld passports for the conference called on 11 July.*4 On the American\nhome front this caused little difficulty; but it eased the more delicate task\nfacing Woodrow Wilson's coalition partners. In Italy, given the PSI's desire\nfor immediate peace negotiations, it was unsurprising that passports should be\nrefused. But in Britain and France there were larger numbers of patriotic\nsocialists whose loyalty to the war effort might be jeopardized, and therefore\nlarger scope for Russian paradiplomacy. In Britain, the foreign-policy\nconsideration of relations with the Russians was probably the principal\ninfluence on the cabinet's handling of the issue. After the May 1917 Petrograd\nsoviet invitation it decided British representatives could attend, both for the\nfavourable effect in Russia and to prevent a tete-a-tete between the soviet and\nthe SPD.45 But at this stage only Ramsay MacDonald and the British counter-\nparts of the French minoritaires wanted to go. After the July joint invitation,\nhowever, Arthur Henderson, the leader of the parliamentary Labour party\n43\n General ly on Stockholm see D.

But the cabinet now refused passports and accepted\nHenderson's resignation. This was partly because ministers felt he had misled\nthem, but also because of unanimous opposition to Stockholm from Britain's\nallies, including reportedly Kerensky, who had now replaced Lvov as Russian\npremier, although he could not openly admit his views.46 Like Tereshchenko's\nwar-aims conference, then, Stockholm came to grief in part because of the\nRussians' own tergiversations. But it was in France, more vulnerable than\nBritain to the revolutionary contagion, where the most agonizing choices had\nto be made. After two socialist deputies, Cachin and Moutet, returned from\na mission to Russia with new revolutionary fire in their bellies, a special SFIO\nNational Council voted on 27-29 May to accept the conference invitation.\nThe two deputies also brought back knowledge of the Constantinople and\nDoumergue agreements, and a delegation went to Ribot to ask for these to be\nannulled.47 Ribot had already decided not to scale down French war aims in\nthe hope of reviving Russia's war effort.48 But he now had to decide whether\nFrance itself was governable without socialist co-operation, for the SFIO's\nvolte-face coincided with a quasi-revolutionary strike wave and the peak of the\nFrench army mutinies. Given the British attitude, he at first hesitated,49 but\nthe conservative parties in the chamber of deputies objected to granting\npassports, and the new commander-in-chief, Petain, warned that if the\nsocialists went to Stockholm he could not answer for military discipline.50\nThere remained the question of the secret treaties, and on 6 June the chamber\npassed the Dumont resolution, which repudiated conquests but called for\nreparations, for Alsace-Lorraine, and for ' lasting guarantees of peace and\nindependence to be obtained... in an organization... of the League of\nNations'.51 But this did not mean that the League in itself was a sufficient\nguarantee, and in a secret session in the senate Ribot not only claimed the\nAlsace-Lorraine of 1790 (which included much of the Saar coalfield) but also\naccepted that a neutral and autonomous Rhineland buffer state 'cannot be\nconsidered a conquest; it is a protective measure'.52 Like the Reichstag\nresolution, Dumont's was a piece of sticking plaster to hold national consensus\nin place, and neither declaration inhibited veiled expansion through buffer\nstates as opposed to more naked annexationism. But precisely such veiled\nexpansion was the outstanding characteristic of the belligerents' European\nwar aims.

This was Pope Benedict\nXV's peace note, published by the Vatican on 16 August 1917. It had been\npreceded by secret consultations, but with Germany only. Pacelli, the papal\nnuncio in Munich, had spoken to the Kaiser and to Bethmann, who had said\nthat Belgium could not regain its independence if this made Britain and\nFrance predominant there.53 The papal note duly proposed that Belgian\nindependence should be guaranteed 'against any power whatsover', but\nwithin the context of a general return to the status quo ante both in Europe\nand overseas (Germany would regain its colonies) and conciliatory settlements\nof the Franco-German and Austro-Italian territorial disputes that would heed,\nas far as possible, the wishes of the populations concerned. Little was said\nabout Eastern Europe, although there was sympathy for Poland. But in sum\nthis would be a peace without annexations and indemnities, as incompatible\nwith the western allies' war aims as with those of OHL.54\nThe note was a first diplomatic test for the new leadership in Berlin, where\nBethmann Hollweg's successor was engaged in an initial round of war-aims\nconsultations with the Austrians and the High Command. Michaelis was\ninexperienced in external affairs, and relied heavily on the advice of his foreign\nminister, Kuhlmann. The latter was therefore Bethmann's true heir.\nKiihlmann accepted that Germany could not realistically expect large\nterritorial gains, and must extricate itself by pursuing a separate peace with\none or other of its enemies \u2014 although unlike Bethmann he saw Britain as the\npotential weak link in the allied chain. But in August he still felt that a peace\ninitiative would be premature, and his and Michaelis's first reaction to the\npapal note was to delay and to reply in generalizations in order to avoid\nentanglement in peace discussions.55 Early in September, however, two\ndevelopments persuaded the Germans to launch a diplomatic offensive after\nall. These were the British reply to the Vatican, and the news of the\nArmand-Revertera conversations.\nThe latter began as another Austro-French contact, although they had\nwider repercussions. In June Count Revertera, a highly placed figure at the\nAustrian court, made known to the French general staff that he wished to meet\none of their intelligence officers, Armand. Painleve, the French war minister,\nwon the consent of Ribot and Lloyd George, and in Switzerland on 7 and 22\nAugust two meetings followed. Armand offered the Austrians Silesia, Bavaria,\n63\n Griinau to Bethmann, 3 July 1917; Zimmermann note, 24 July 1917, ibid. docs. 157, 175.\nT. von Bethmann Hollweg, Betrachtungen zum Weltkriege (2 vols., Berlin, 1919), 11, 210-14.\n54\n T e x t of the no te in Scott (ed.) , War aims, p p . 1 2 9 - 3 1 .\n55\n Michael is to Gr i inau , 21 A u g . 1917; K u h l m a n n to Wede l , 27 Aug . 1917, ibid. docs. 216,\n225.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nTHE FAILURE OF PEACE 79\nand a reunited Poland with its 1772 frontiers, in return for a separate peace,\nalthough in a general settlement with the central powers much less generous\nconditions would be available. He also proposed a further meeting, between\nPainleve and Czernin themselves.56 In itself, all this mattered little. The\nextravagant offers made to Revertera had been authorized in general terms by\nPainleve, but no higher, and even the war minister felt afterwards that\nArmand had been 'too absolute'.57 Ribot himself had stipulated that Armand\nshould merely listen to Revertera, and he was never forwarded the dossier on\nthe affair.58 On the Austrian side, Czernin remained uninterested in a separate\nFranco-Austrian deal. But he did use Armand's 'terms' and Painleve's\nreported willingness to meet him as a lever on the Germans, and it is here that\nthe episode's main significance lies. Painleve's was a rising political star, and\nin September-November 1917 he briefly succeeded to Ribot as French prime\nminister, though keeping Ribot on as minister for foreign affairs. German\nagents in Switzerland had received reports that if Painleve reached the\npremiership he would be prepared for a 'reasonable understanding', on the\nbasis of commercial and colonial concessions in exchange for Alsace-\nLorraine.59 So when at the end of August Czernin proposed to the Germans\nthat he should take up Painleve's offer to meet him, Kiihlmann was startled\nand rushed to Vienna. The affair, he concluded, was a clever and dangerous\nbid to split the central powers. Rather than let Austria take the lead in\nrepresenting Germany in general negotiation the Berlin government must\nstart an initiative of its own.60\nAt the same time as Kiihlmann gained a motive to act, Britain's response\nto Benedict XV gave him an occasion. Neither the French, nor the Italian, nor\nthe American government wished to follow up the Vatican appeal. But when\nLloyd George's cabinet met on 20 August, a fissure in this unanimity opened.\nMinisters had been much sobered by the allies' military disasters during the\nyear, and they authorized Balfour, the foreign secretary, to reply that it was\nfor the central powers to take the lead in disclosing their objectives. This was\nevidently to leave the door ajar, especially as Balfour's telegram to his Vatican\nrepresentative, de Salis, singled out Britain's primary concern by noting that\nthe enemy had indicated no intention either to restore Belgium's full\nsovereignty or to make good the damage that the country had suffered.

The attempts to end the war by compromise now\nreached their climax.\nDuring September 1917 both the French and British governments received\napproaches from Berlin: the French through the so-called Briand-Lancken\naffair, and the British in response to the de Salis overture. But for Kiihlmann\nit was the opening to London that mattered, and he hoped to counter the\nArmand-Revertera danger by trying to divide Britain and France. At the\nBellevue crown council on 11 September he won authority from the Kaiser\nand OHL to reply to the de Salis message and to diminish Germany's Belgian\ndemands. Rejecting the papacy as an appropriate conduit, he approached the\nSpanish diplomatic representative in the Low Countries, Villalobar. But\ninstead of acting himself, Villalobar notified the Spanish foreign minister, who\neventually conveyed to the British ambassador in Madrid the bald information\nthat ' a very exalted personage' in Germany wished to make ' a communication\nrelative to peace'.63 This was a less authoritative and explicit signal than\nKiihlmann had intended, and it said nothing about Belgium. None the less,\nBalfour correctly divined its author, and felt that to ignore it might risk\ndemoralizing British opinion and strengthening the Pan-Germans in Berlin.\nBut he also felt that any answer must spell out that Britain could not engage\nin even the most non-committal conversations without first informing its\npartners, and on this crucial principle the cabinet, for a second time, wavered.\nOn 24 September, after a difficult discussion, it decided to reconsider after a\nmeeting to be held on the following day between Lloyd George and Painleve,\nnow newly installed as French prime minister, at Boulogne.64\nThe Boulogne meeting had also to consider the second German feeler: the\nBriand\u2014Lancken affair. Lancken was the head of the political department of\nthe German occupation administration in Brussels, and had served in the\nGerman embassy in Paris before the war. In April 1917 he had been\nauthorized to sound out French politicians and officials with offers of token\nconcessions in Alsace-Lorraine, and had soon concentrated his attention on\nBriand, as a former wartime prime minister who was now out of office.65\nContacted via Belgian intermediaries who included the prime minister of the\nBelgian government-in-exile, de Broqueville, Briand agreed in principle to\nmeet Lancken in Switzerland, and seems genuinely to have supposed that the\nwhole of the lost provinces might be obtainable.

Asked by Ribot\nto prepare a memorandum for discussion with the allies, Briand presented a\nletter on 20 September thai specified there could be no separate agreement but\nomitted the claims of France's partners from its proposed terms. Ribot then\nsent a circular to his ambassadors in which he distanced himself from Briand,\nand gave the impression that the latter had wished to proceed without\nconsulting the allies.67 This predetermined a critical allied response, which\nLloyd George echoed at the Boulogne meeting,68 but on the 23rd Briand had\nalready been told that the meeting with Lancken could not take place. The\nother channels of communication lasted little longer. After the Boulogne\nmeeting the British cabinet met again, and this time permitted Balfour to\ninform the allied representatives in London about the Villalobar feeler.69 At\na meeting with the ambassadors on 6 October it was agreed to tell the\nGermans that Britain would be willing to receive any communication about\npeace and to discuss it with the other allies. Kiihlmann never replied. And a\nfortnight later the Austrians suspended the Armand-Revertera contact on the\ngrounds that the French conditions were too severe and the Habsburg\nmonarchy's position had improved. The shutters were now down.\nOnce again, territory and alliance cohesion were the principal points at\nissue. Both France and Germany had become more flexible, but insufficiently.\nRibot doubted the value of a permanent French occupation of the left bank\nof the Rhine, although he favoured a buffer state.70 Painleve may have felt\nsome form of Rhineland demilitarization would be enough.71 Michaelis\ndiffered from Bethmann in not insisting on the annexation of Longwy-Briey,\nas long as Germany had secure access to the iron ore. But Ludendorff still\nwanted both the orefield and a protective glacis, and over Alsace-Lorraine he\nand Kiihlmann could agree that only small frontier changes were possible.72\nOn 9 October the foreign minister told the Reichstag that Germany would\n\" G.

Kuhlmann\nenvisaged a German declaration satisfying Britain over Belgium being\nconditional on an allied commitment to Germany's territorial integrity as of\n1914, including the restoration of its colonies.75 On this last point he was\nwilling for some compromise, as might Lloyd George have been, although the\nprime minister would have had to take into account the claims on Germany's\noverseas possessions by the Dominions, the French and the Japanese, as well\nas the Admiralty's anxiety to deprive the enemy of potential bases for U-boats\nand commerce raiders that could threaten British imperial communications.76\nThe gap between what Lloyd George could offer and Kuhlmann could accept\nwas therefore likely to be wide, even leaving aside the German navy, which\nBritish official thinking took for granted must be destroyed.77 And what could\nKuhlmann offer Britain? Wilhelm told him after the Bellevue council that he\nhad a free hand to get peace by Christmas, but this was really authority only\nto drop the German navy's demand for Flanders coastal bases.78 Perhaps\nbecause of the pressure on his troops from Haig's murderous third Ypres\noffensive, Ludendorff conceded that the issue did not justify prolonging the\nwar for another winter, and the navy found itself isolated.79 Wilhelm, though\nsympathetic to the admirals and afraid of Pan-German agitation, said at\nBellevue that the Flanders coast should not prevent a 'decent' peace, provided\nBelgium and Germany were closely integrated economically.80 Michaelis\nwanted to keep a special position at Antwerp, retain influence over the\nFlemish autonomists, and occupy Liege and a strip protecting the Ruhr until\neconomic ties had grown so close that Belgium could not go to war against\nGermany.81 Hindenburg and Ludendorff favoured all of this and a prolonged\noccupation, doubting whether economic ties alone could ever be an adequate\nsecurity guarantee.82 Yet restoring Belgium to its pre-war status remained the\nmost unequivocal British objective on the continent of Europe, and over this\n73\n Kuhlmann in Reichstag, Scott (ed.), War aims, p. 159.

The de\nSalis telegram, after all, invited German concessions rather than proposing\nBritish ones.\nBehind the Anglo-German and Franco-German disputes lay, once again,\nthe question of alliance solidarity. Lancken's feelers were intended to test the\nprospects for a separate peace, but Briand envisaged, or said he envisaged, any\nmeeting in Switzerland as a stepping-stone to a general settlement. Painleve,\nat first enthusiastic for the interview, changed his mind after consulting his\nministers, apparently not because too little was on offer but because he\n'doubted whether France would continue fighting if it were offered both nine-\ntenths of Alsace-Lorraine and the whole of Belgium'.83 Ribot's conduct was\ngoverned no doubt in part by antipathy towards Briand but also by his\nsuspicion that the feeler was a 'snare': that Briand's visit to Switzerland would\nat once be publicized, with possibly fatal damage to allied unity and French\ncivilian morale.84 In fact the evidence from the German side vindicates neither\nview. The channel was of secondary importance to Kuhlmann, who told\nLancken to ' offer little' and play for time until the fate of the Villalobar feeler\nhad been clarified. An 'ocean of hate' separated France from Germany, and\nlittle or nothing could be conceded in Alsace-Lorraine. But the French war\neffort depended on the British, and a deal with London might be the\nmechanism for bringing France to terms. Further, he had information that the\nLloyd George government, which he thought ruthlessly committed to victory,\nwas under challenge from more moderate figures such as, supposedly, Asquith\nand Balfour.85 The British had indeed been consulted only cursorily over\nFrench ambitions in the Rhineland, and were not committed to their\nsupport.86 Nor, much to French chagrin, would Lloyd George pledge himself\nunequivocally even over Alsace-Lorraine.87 But France was too central to\nBritish interests for it to be allowed to be defeated or estranged, and the\ncabinet was agreed that Painleve must be informed about the Villalobar\nfeeler. The doubt came not over France but over Russia, and it was not\nBalfour but Lloyd George himself who led the sceptics about alliance\nsolidarity. On 24 September he and several other ministers wanted to delay\ncommunicating with the allies other than France until Germany's exact\nproposals were known. If Russia dropped out of the war, felt the prime\nminister, it should pay the territorial price. Lord Milner countered that\nGermany would leave the conflict more powerful than it had entered, if it won\na free hand in the east. And Balfour feared the Russians would drop out all the\nsooner if they learned of peace conversations going on behind their back.\nWhen discussion resumed three days later a cabinet majority formed against\n83\n See note 74 above.\n84\n Suarez, Briand, iv, 270-1.

In the long term, American\nintervention was the most decisive of the events that broke the European\nstalemate and made possible the conclusion of the war. But in the short term\nit reinforced and prolonged that stalemate, at both the military and the\ndiplomatic level. When the Americans declared war on Germany, Britain had\nthe wherewithal to finance only three weeks' further purchases in the USA.89\nWithout American entry, economic paralysis, coupled with the February\nrevolution, would probably have driven the allies into, at best, an\nunfavourable compromise. American assistance during 1917, however, was\nprimarily naval and economic, and even in this form it was deliberately\nrationed. By October the American troops in France still numbered only\n80,000.90 Wilson did enough to keep the allies in the war, but the German\nleaders could still suppose that Russia's disintegration made possible a military\nvictory. Michaelis judged in August that Germany could continue for another\nyear, and at the time of the Bellevue council LudendorfF advised that the\ncentral powers' position was stronger than that of their enemies.91 Conversely,\nLloyd George, at least in retrospect, considered American aid a reason for\npersevering in 1917, and Ribot telegraphed to his ambassador in Washington\nthat 'until the United States has made the decisive effort it is preparing, we\nshall not be in a favourable position to negotiate'.92\nThe European allies therefore gambled that American intervention would\nallow them to impose their war aims. They did so even though Wilson publicly\ndistanced himself from those aims, notably in his message of 27 August - issued\nunilaterally and without consultation - in reply to the Pope. The president did\nnot, however, press his partners to negotiate. If he had advocated ' peace\nwithout victory' while America was neutral, he now intended to defeat and\ndemocratize Imperial Germany as a precondition for the general reformation\nof international politics that he desired.

Thus he vetoed\na proposal by his treasury secretary that American loans should be made in\npart conditional on their being used to accomplish American war aims,93 and\nnoted in July that ' when the war is over we can force them [i.e. France and\nBritain] to our way of thinking because by that time they will, among other\nthings, be financially in our hands'.94 Similarly, in his reply to Benedict XV\nhe both implicitly condemned his partners' plans for ' the dismemberment of\nempires' and yet also rejected a return to the pre-war status quo.95 And\nalthough he denied American passports for the Stockholm conference, his\npresence on the allied side helped maintain labour and socialist support in\nWestern Europe for the war effort. So far from American diplomacy reducing\nallied objectives, therefore, it contributed to a more subtle and largely\ncosmetic readjustment, of which the allied commitment to the League of\nNations and the British espousal of a Jewish national home in Palestine were\nboth products. Neither militarily nor diplomatically did the American factor\nyet operate in favour of a compromise peace.\nThe European holocaust was therefore prolonged in 1917 for the same\nreasons as it had begun: both sides had political objectives that they\nconsidered too important to abandon, and both supposed there was a chance\nof victory if they carried on. Another incremental decision was made \u2014 to keep\ngoing for 'ten minutes longer' than the enemy, as LudendorfF put it, or, in\nClemenceau's words, 'until the last quarter of a hour'.98 Although the co-\nhesion of the home fronts fractured, the leading beneficiaries were the centrist\nsocialists rather than the revolutionaries, and they failed, in Germany, Britain,\nFrance, and Italy, to win more than a superficial alteration in war aims. Karl\nin Vienna and the new authorities in Petrograd lacked the power and\nruthlessness to impose moderation on their coalition partners; it did not yet\nsuit Woodrow Wilson to make the attempt. The technical difficulties of\nclandestine feelers through amateur intermediaries were not the primary\nreason for the failure to compromise in 1917. The obstacles were real and\ndeep. Austria-Hungary and Italy were at loggerheads over the Adriatic and\nthe South Tyrol; Russia and the central powers over the Baltic littoral and\nPoland; France and Germany over the Rhineland and Alsace-Lorraine;\nBritain and Germany over Germany's colonies and Belgium. Overriding all of\nthis were the complexities of decentralized decision-making in a coalition war,\nin which to make a gesture to the enemy might threaten alliance solidity. And\nif peace feelers were made public they might enfeeble military and civilian\nmorale and start an irreversible process that would eventually suspend\noperations along the existing fronts. It was no accident that in Western Europe\n93\n Fowler, Wiseman, pp. 43-4.\n*\n4\n L. W. Martin, Peace without victory: Woodrow Wilson end the British Liberals (New Haven,\n1958), p. 141.

This was,\nin part, inherent in an international system based on sovereign states, and that\nsystem bears its portion of responsibility for the tragedy of 1917. If all the\nbelligerents had renounced their contradictory objectives and been content to\nlive in harmony on the basis of the pre-war status quo, the slaughter need not\nhave continued. But the long growth in international tension and suspicion\nsince the turn of the century, and the impact of three years of total war, ruled\nthis out. A Germany where Ludendorff had acquired a veto over foreign\npolicy, and was already looking to the next round, was close to Kissinger's\narchetype of the 'revolutionary power' for whom only absolute security could\nsuffice, at the price of absolute insecurity for its neighbours.97 Conversely,\nLloyd George argued afterwards that the allied decision to hold on should be\njudged by the durability of the 1919 settlement in comparison with the likely\ndurability of one negotiated - if negotiation was possible - with this Germany\ntwo years earlier.98 'Peace without victory' was not the basis of the relatively\nlasting settlements after 1815 and 1945, and the sacrifices of the allied armies\nin 1918 won at least the possibility of constructing such a settlement, even if\nthe opportunity was squandered. At all events, what Wilson promised would\nbe 'force, force to the utmost, force without stint or limit'99 would now decide\nthe issue.\n97\n H . A.
