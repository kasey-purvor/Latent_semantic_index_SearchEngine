Collins. \nPrinceton, NJ: Markus Wiener Publishers. 2006. 340pp. Index. Pb.: \u00a319.95. isbn 1 \n55876 4054. \n \nAt a time when Hollywood stars are leading the world in observing \u2018Darfur day\u2019 to show \nsolidarity with civilians in the war-torn region, the US is imposing sanctions against \ncompanies involved in the oil business with the government of Sudan and the UN is \ndrafting yet another resolution to exert international pressure on Khartoum, this book\u2019s \ntitle is somewhat misleading. In fact the book is not solely about Darfur. Those seeking a \nsuccinct overview of why the world has been gripped by the attacks and mass \ndisplacement in a remote region in western Sudan are better advised to look elsewhere. \nThere has been no shortage of information on Darfur since the most recent outbreak of \nconflict in February 2003. Innumerable  journalistic accounts and human rights reports have \ndrawn a detailed picture of the shocking scale of ongoing atrocities. Yet recent accounts \ntend to situate Darfur\u2019s conflict as the result of relatively recent marginalization by a \npower-hungry and centralized govern- ment in Khartoum. Darfur\u2019s exclusion from the \nNorth\/South Sudanese peace process, that led to the signing of the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement in 2005, is often cited as the underlying reason for the region\u2019s descent into war \nsince 2003. In-depth scholarship on the long history of the conflict has been scarce. Recent \nnoteworthy books have concentrated on either the linkage between developments in the \nregion with international structures, or the background of the warring actors, such as the \nworks by Gerard Prunier and Alex de Waal and Julie Flint. \nDarfur: the long road to disaster is an altogether different book and one that fills important \nlacunae. It replaces the now out-of-print Africa\u2019s thirty years war (1999) and adds currency with a \nconcise chapter on recent developments and an epilogue. It delves deeply into the history of \nthe entire region to uncover the interlocking and complex root causes of the crisis. \nFurthermore, it asks difficult questions such as: why has the war escalated? By presenting a \nhistorical context of regional political relations between Chad, Libya and Sudan, this book \nposits that the war in Darfur is primarily about power, borders and \n  \n \nidentity. Burr and Collins have admirably used a wide range of sources to write a convincing \nstudy of a multi-layered, complex conflict, driven by leadership, tribal differences, race and \nreligion, geopo- litical players and international actors. Darfur\u2019s recent disaster is captured \nonly as the last chapter (which unfortunately suffers from slight inaccuracies) in this long-\nrunning conflict that has devastated the triangle in various locations at various times since \n1963. \nThe book gives a clear and detailed account of the power struggle in the Chad, Libya and \nSudan triangle, starting with the civil war in Chad in the early 1960s, in which the Muslim \nnorth rebelled against the ruling African Christian south. Muslim rebels found supporters \nin the Sudanese govern- ment in their quest to overthrow the Tombalbaye government in \nChad. When Libya under Colonel Qadhafi entered the conflict, the conflict triangle was to \nfurther engage the US, France, the UN and the Organization of African Unity. The detailed \nanalysis of French\u2013Chadian relations, US\u2013Libyan interactions and the international role \nmakes clear that the disaster in Darfur has many roots that are important to consider. \nWhile the book purports to be about Darfur, it is about much more:  it is an outstanding \nanalysis of the history of bloody conflict in a vast African region over 40 years. The historical \nlessons of profound interconnectedness that can be learned from it are timely and needed \nin the current Darfur debate. \n \nMareike Schomerus \n \n \n"}
