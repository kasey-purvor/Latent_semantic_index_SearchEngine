A subject close, we might hope, to the hearts and \nminds of all academics. Both place and conference were inspirational, a hugely \ninteresting and well attended conference and a place which had once been a home to \nJames Joyce\u2019s muse, Nora Barnacle, a person to whom I will return later. \n \nThe title of this paper includes the word \u2018realism\u2019 and it is this word which I wish , \ninitially, to try and define. For students of literature and visual representation the word \nhas long had the meaning of that movement in fiction and art which turned to the \neveryday, quotidian world for its subject matter. In literature we can recognise this \nvery clearly in what has long been described as the \u2018rise\u2019 of the novel, the emergence \nin the eighteenth century of the fiction which examined the careers of both societies \nand individuals in ways specific to defined contexts and characteristics. No longer \nwere heroines and heroes to be mythical figures, they were now to be those \u2018ordinary\u2019 \ncharacters with names such as Tom Jones or Fanny Price  who have become \ncommonplace figures of western culture. This \u2018realistic\u2019 fiction tells us stories about \nvarious kinds of relationships ( for example, marriage, courtship or motherhood ) \nwhich we can all identify with. George Eliot, Elizabeth Gaskell, Charles Dickens and \nLeo Tolstoy, just a few of the great narrative realists of the nineteenth century, told us \nabout worlds we either know or with which we could establish imaginative \nconnections. The work of all these novelists told us tales with inherent possibilities \nabout what might happen to their characters : in War and Peace we wonder if Natasha \nis going to marry Pierre, we conjecture about the possible endurance , in \nMiddlemarch, of the marriage of Dorothea to Casaubon.  \n \nThus I would suggest, initially, that whilst the much used term \u2018realism\u2019 always has \nconnections with the various domestic and social worlds which we know it also has, \nand would hardly be fiction or a work of the imagination if it did not, a degree of \nuncertainty and openness in its passage towards a  conclusion . Indeed, part of the  \nmeasure of the quality of fiction is the degree to which we are convinced that the \nconclusion has been reached through the created agency of the characters rather than \nthe explicit authority and control of the author. In this , realist fiction is both \nclearly\u2019realistic\u2019 in the sense that it can tell us , for example,about the ways in which \npeople organised and conducted their daily lives , and un-realistic  in the way in \nwhich it can introduce elements of chance or coincidence. The less that the\u2019unlikely\u2019 \noccurs in fiction the more we are inclined to accept the questions which the novelist is \nasking us to consider. Jane Austen, for example, knew and demonstrated the \ntemptations of the bizarre in  Northanger Abbey ; generally read as a satire on the \ngothic novel and the over-abundance of the imagination in real life  , the novel is also \na demonstration of the part that the imagination should play in everyday life. If we \ncannot see, like Catherine Moreland, that a wooden chest might  contain something \nmore than old laundry lists then we do not have the imagination either  to see \nourselves in different kinds of human relationships or make the kind of imaginative \nleaps that make possible art, science and the construction of the material world. \n \nThe \u2018realism\u2019 associated with late eighteenth and nineteenth century European fiction \nthus allowed both the recognisably realistic and a degree of imagination . The superb \nbalance achieved in Austen,  Eliot et al gave us the canonical fiction which is  such a \nrich part of European culture. Yet in the twentieth century various kinds of challenges \nto realism occurred. In the old Soviet Union the early intellectual experimentation of \nthe Revolution gave way to what the critic Georg Lukacs was to describe ( with a \nconsiderable absence of enthusiasm ) as  \u2018socialist realism\u2019. This movement, in both \nliterature and the visual arts, he contrasted to \u2018critical realism\u2019 ( the great works of the \nnineteenth century ) and to the work of writers such as Virginia Woolf and James \nJoyce, whose concern was to illuminate individual subjectivity. There is a place ( as \nthe art critic Andrew Hemingway has pointed out ) for re-thinking the art of socialist \nrealism, not least because it gave a place in representational art to those millions of \npeople who had seldom previously achieved, as either individuals or as metaphors for \nparticular kinds of work , any form of recognition. (1) But this re-thinking was \ndecades away from the assumptions of Lukacs and other, western, critics. Whilst \nLukacs was as unenthusiastic about Joyce as he was about socialist realism, western \ncritics hailed the work of Woolf, Joyce and Marcel Proust as ground-breaking work in \nthe history of literature.  \n \nWhat literary modernism did was to re-situate the realism of the nineteenth century in \nterms of a negotiation with  the achievements of Woolf and her contemporaries . It \nalso introduced into discussions of the novel diverse traditions of the \u2018realistic\u2019 and \nthe meaning of realism. In many ways a curious process of cultural osmosis took \nplace in the west in which  the Soviet meaning of realism  often became part of the \nmeaning of \u2018realism\u2019; to be \u2018realistic came to mean both an acceptance of  the \nimagination and a determination to discuss those aspects of the social world ( class, \nsex and money ) which was often resisted. In the history of the theatre in England this \nparticular construction of the \u2018realistic\u2019 was often met with a considerable degree of  \nantipathy; the \u2018new\u2019 English drama of John Osborne and Shelagh Delaney was \ndescribed with  the perjorative title \u2018kitchen sink drama\u2019 . Yet the dramatists \nthemselves surely saw their work as \u2018realistic\u2019 in the more positive, nineteenth \ncentury sense; it might have been heretical in the 1950s to consider the links of \nsympathy between George Eliot and John Osborne but with hindsight we might \nconsider that these two authors ( and others across the nineteenth and the twentieth \ncenturies )  shared the same assumptions about the  necessary centrality of the idea of \nrealism to works of the imagination. \n \nIt might therefore seem, in the light of this abbreviated account of the idea of realism , \nthat realism is a very complex idea and one which can bring together authors across \ntime,place, class, race and gender. Realism, and the realistic, are not, therefore, ideas \nor sets of possibilities which we  should necessarily  reject or locate in terms of a \ntedious, mechanistic  reproduction of the social and personal world. But unfortunately \nfor many in contemporary universities a new meaning of \u2018realism\u2019 has come to hold \nsway, a meaning which limits inquiry and is , in many ways, hostile to debate and \ndiscussion. This form of realism I would describe as \u2018coercive realism\u2019, the form of \nrealism which insists that we can describe, absolutely and finally the social world and \nthat the world in which we live is not merely \u2018real\u2019 but is also both  constant and \nfixed.  \n \n \nThis view, like all views of the world, has intellectual parents and it is useful to define \ncertain aspects of that parentage. The first and most obvious form of the new account \nof realism is derived from the ideas surrounding the \u2018fall\u2019 of the Berlin Wall in 1989 \nand the end of the old Soviet Union.  One of the many implications of this dramatic \nevent was the global  normalisation of the market economy and the apparent \nnaturalisation of views about the nature of the relationship of the individual to \nproperty and to the state. The \u2018naturalisation\u2019 of the market economy suggested that \nthe given order of the social world, and that of the social relationships within it, was \nthat of capitalism, a free market and the legitimacy of the pursuit of profit. It was not \nthat these ideas had not been espoused before 1989, in various versions they had been \npart of many parts of the world for centuries. But post 1989,  voices in neo-liberal \nsocieties across the globe spoke of certain forms of economic relations in terms which \nincreasingly naturalised them. The impact of this on the universities was that the \nThatcher and Major governments in Great Britain faced little confrontation when \nsuggesting that it was entirely appropriate that universities should  engage in \n\u2018enterprise\u2019 and \u2018entrepreneurship\u2019.  Accordingly, from the 1980s onwards, \nuniversities ( and academics ) have increasingly been asked to provide evidence of \ntheir contribution to the economic market-place. The justification for this is that it \nwould be wrong to allow universities, largely supported as they are by tax payers\u2019 \nmoney, to fail to contribute to the national economy. The argument is sometimes \ndifficult to resist: few people wish to be seen to be a-social ( in the sense of refusing \nto contribute to a wider society ) but at the same time questions about , let us say, the \ndistribution of wealth go unanswered. A curiously \u2018a -social\u2019 thesis operates in these \nideas : we are all expected to contribute to society but definitions of the meaning of \nthat society are not welcomed. \n \nA second, and rather more diffuse, parentage of \u2018coercive realism\u2019  is the use of the \nterm \u2018natural\u2019 in various social contexts. Any observer of the market place of the \ntwenty first century will be familiar with the advertising claim that \u2018we are all worth \nit\u2019 ( a claim that on humanistic grounds  few of us  would refute ) and since we are all \n\u2018worth it\u2019 it is \u2018natural\u2019 that we should want , let us say , expensive handbags or a re-\ndecoration of our home or whatever else are the consumer goods on display and for \nsale. This naturalisation of the desire for consumer goods has become so closely \nassociated with constructs of \u2018human nature\u2019 that it is seldom remarked upon, but with \nit comes assumptions about the essential maintenance of economic growth and the \nentrepreneurial spirit. This spirit, which Max Weber described as  part of the \u2018spirit of \ncapitalism\u2019  was crucially recognised by him as an emergent property of sixteenth \ncentury Calvinism. In this, Weber offered what was a social , rather than a natural, \nunderstanding of a view of the world. The irony is that in the twenty first century , as \nour relationship with the actual \u2018natural\u2019 world becomes increasingly problematic so \nwe turn to it as the derivation of our social beliefs.  \n \nThe process of the naturalisation of consumer desire and the material order of the \nmarket economy is to be found throughout both social and intellectual life. There are \nnumerous ways in which this might be demonstrated but two examples suggest \nsomething of the changes in understanding that are being produced. The first is that \nonce we see the market economy as the norm in social life and as the \u2018normal\u2019 in \nhuman aspiration we implicitly make dissent from this view abnormal. Thus long, and \ndiverse, traditions about, for example, trade union rights become by their very content \noppositional. The second is that the appetite of desire for consumption is limitless : \nlike a child fed only on sweets , what emerges are monsters in which desire is never \nsatiated. If we put together these two examples, of what Lisa Rofel has described as \nthe \u2018desiring subjects\u2019 of the market economy with the marginalisation of alternative \nnormative traditions , what we confront , in terms of the students in universities , are \npeople who have become used to certain kinds of largely unchallenged assumptions \nabout the social world. (2) The homogeneity of much western political discourse \nmakes it often difficult to suggest that the cultural and intellectual histories of the \nworld are not about a seamless progression towards a global market economy but \nabout  diverse and often contradictory attitudes and values. Whilst much effort has \nbeen devoted to the discussion, and representation of cultural difference, there \nremains a sense in which political difference has become increasingly obscured . In \nthis context it is often difficult to see the way , as T.S.Eliot wrote : \n                   \n               \u2018\u2026to show you something different \n                from either, \n                Your shadow at morning striding behind you \n                or your shadow at evening rising to meet you.\u2019 (3) \n \nThe question with which we are then faced, as academics, is how to show that \nsomething\u2019different\u2019 in universities. Aspects of that difference are not necessarily \nalways contested ; a considerable amount of academic work in the past twenty years \nhas actively re-written the curricula of many university departments : what was once \nthe \u2018canon\u2019 , in disciplines across the humanities and the social sciences, has been \ndisputed and found wanting. A new \u2018canon\u2019 has been instrumental in bringing to the \nacademic world the study of women, of non-white people and of cultures outside the \nprevious gaze of western eyes.\u2019Difference\u2019 has become, in many ways, an established \npart of the university curriculum. \n \nYet for all that, and despite the manifest and remarkable changes in what is now \nstudied at universities throughout the west there is an accompanying normalisation of \nother aspects of the \u2018real\u2019 world. Of this, ideas about the \u2018real \u2018 world and \u2018being \nrealistic\u2019 are of central importance. This has led, I would suggest, to the \n\u2018management\u2019 of knowledge in ways which are deemed appropriate in terms of the \n\u2018real\u2019 world. The idea of the \u2018real\u2019 world of course constructs a binary division, in \nwhich we are asked to accept that the world of the universities, and the goals which \nwe might pursue within them, are in some sense \u2018unreal\u2019. There has been for decades \na view of the universities which argues that they are the ivory towers of the social \nworld, places in which people with little understanding of the everyday produce work \nwhich only deepens that divide between the academy and the general population. That \nview never had any real substance. In various ways, not all of them necessarily \npositive, British universities always had close connections with the \u2018real\u2019 world . They \nproduced , for example, almost all the country\u2019s research in the  natural sciences and \nat the same time they produced generations of young people ( largely, it has to be \nsaid, young male people ) who were trained and educated in ways deemed appropriate \nfor the administration of various sectors of both the domestic and the overseas state. \nTo argue , in the light of this evidence, that universities constituted \u2018ivory towers\u2019 was \nto ignore the many crucial interventions which universities made in British social and \npolitical life. \n \nBut the idea of the distinction between the \u2018real\u2019 and the \u2018unreal\u2019 world has built on \nthe very flimsy sands of the idea of the \u2018ivory tower\u2019 to produce an even more rigid , \nand arguably more damaging, view of the relationship between universities and the \nwider world. In this more contemporary view, universities are asked to \u2018get real\u2019 and \ntold that \u2018we have to live in the real world\u2019. This endless re-iteration of the apparent, \nand clearly firmly internalised , account of the real and the unreal ignores many of the \nempirical links that exist ( and have always existed ) between the academic world and \nthe world outside. At the same time, the coercive assumption that the \u2018real\u2019 world is \nthe world which should dictate the conduct of university life becomes the principle \naround which universities are increasingly organised. Thus it is all too easy for \nuniversities to assume ( or to be encouraged to assume ) that their priorities should \ninclude teaching \u2018work related skills\u2019 and assessing students in terms of their ability to \npresent ideas. In these novel pedagogic agendas there exists a curious mix of both \nvaluable and less valuable innovations. For example, offering various forms of \nteaching guides to students and emphasising the importance of communication is to \nprovide significant assistance for many students. At the same time, an emphasis on \n\u2018presentation\u2019 can over-shadow content. As many people who have attended \n\u2018presentations\u2019 will know, it may very well be the case that the content of what is \nbeing said has little or no importance.  To offer students prepared packs of reading \nmay appear to be helpful, but at the same time it might carry a message that the pack \ncontains all that there is to know. The question of the subliminal message of \ncontemporary aids to teaching demands a greater degree of attention than it usually \nreceives. \n \nThe pressures, throughout Europe, to extend recruitment in higher education has \ninevitably led to a degree of inconsistent standards throughout the sector. Differences \nin funding, and the \u2018cultural capital\u2019 not just of individuals, but also of institutions, \ncan ( and does) make a significant difference to the quality of higher education. But \nhere a second aspect of the question of the  \u2018real world\u2019 intrudes, in that the \nuniversities where the \u2018real\u2019 world is likely to be the most visible are generally those \nuniversities with the least in the way of resources. For ancient and long established \nuniversities ( in Britain Oxbridge and the old civic universities ) the \u2018real\u2019 world, of \neconomic scarcity, a  student body with various forms of social disadvantage  and the \npressure to accord with government demands  can be resisted through various ways, \nnot least the degrees of financial  independence and significant social status which \nthose institutions possess. Hence the \u2018real\u2019 world, of the constant need to accord with \ngovernment strictures makes less impact in these institutions. The inevitable paradox \nis that the very democratisation of higher education which its expansion was designed \nto ensure is lessened by the impact of academically detrimental  policies which can be \nmore easily resisted by the privileged than by others. For example, in England there \nhas been a pattern in which higher status universities or university colleges  ( for \nexample Oxbridge and the London School of Economics ) have been able to resist the \nmost obvious interventions by the QAA in the pattern of teaching and the explicit \ncollusion with the demands of the labour market. A further paradox which is also \napparent here is that these very higher status universities are those institutions whose \ngraduates are more widely welcomed  in the labour market. It would appear that the \n\u2018real\u2019 world does not extend a particularly warm hand of welcome to those educated \nin terms of the \u2018real\u2019 world. \n \nCollusion with the apparent aspirations of the  \u2018real\u2019 world does not, it would seem, \nalways reward those who most energetically pursue that path. In this we come to \nanother aspect of the question of the \u2018real\u2019 and the \u2018unreal\u2019 worlds. It is that this \ndistinction fails to recognise the great complexity of the process of learning and the \nidea of \u2018knowledge\u2019 which underpins it. By its very nature academic teaching and \nresearch is open-ended and always , and certainly at its very best, a way of looking at \nand studying the world which allows as much for what we do not know as we do. \nAmbiguity, doubt, dissent, disorder are valuable and central tenets of the academic \nprocess: how else, we might ask rhetorically, should we ever learn to question and to \nthink critically about what we know. To abandon this account of \u2018the getting of \nwisdom\u2019 in favour of a template which speaks of \u2018learning objectives \u2018 is to endorse a \nform of inquiry which has all the hallmarks of those authoritarian regimes ( whether \nof the past or the present ) when there was only one way to \u2018know\u2019. The case of \nscience in the old Soviet Union is the dramatic example of this kind of approach to \nknowledge : the refusal to allow scepticism made it very difficult, if not impossible, \nfor advances to be made. \n \n \nThe over-management of knowledge, and an over-management which is legitimated \nin terms of its value for the \u2018real\u2019 world, thus fails to do two things . First of all it \nentirely fails to distinguish between information, knowledge and wisdom. The world \nof the twenty first century is one which for many people is information rich : the inter-\nnet gives many of us rapid access to enormous amounts of material. But we have to \ncontinue to recognise the distinctions between information and knowledge. We do not \nhave to disallow information but what is essential is learning , and being taught, that \nwhat we have to take to this information is the ability to consider and assess it. The \nsecond issue about the over-management of knowledge is that it refuses the \ncontradictions and the ambiguities , the incoherence and the chaos of both the social \nand the intellectual world. In  \u2018managing\u2019 knowledge, and formatting it  in ways \nwhich make it easy to assimilate and process, we can often avoid the recognition of \nthe ways in which ideas are not always part of  ordered patterns or those binary forms \nof \u2018for\u2019 and \u2018against\u2019. In narrative fiction in the nineteenth century bourgeois realism \nopened the eyes of many to the cruelties and injustices of the social world. The \nbourgeois \u2018realism\u2019 of the twenty first century is often more inclined to secure \nagreement and the authority of the conventional than it is to consider what might be \ndifficult or uncomfortable.  \n \n \nThe present seizing of the idea of \u2018realism \u2018 for purposes that many of us might \nquestion should not, however, encourage us to abandon the term. There is , \nnotwithstanding the best efforts of various state agencies to persuade us that the \u2018real\u2019 \ncan be easily defined, what might be described as a \u2018real\u2019 realism. This realism , \nrather than engaging with some of the fanciful aspects of constructions of the world, \nrecognises some of the \u2018real\u2019 realities of the world, a world in which , for example, \naccess to clean water constitutes a major source of global inequality. Other \u2018real\u2019 \naspects of the world which we might consider include the capacity of the employment \nmarket to absorb large numbers of graduates or the relationship between the financial \ncost of higher education with individual financial gains from it. Even more \u2018real\u2019, in \n2009, is the question , and the implications, of the health of consumer spending in \nrelation to general social prosperity.  \n \nAll these three questions constitute \u2018real\u2019 questions and they can be substantiated in \nterms of evidence and the experience of everyday lives. The answers to these \nquestions suggests that one of the great challenges which we face in the twenty first \ncentury is learning to distinguish between various forms of \u2018realism\u2019, the one which \noffers a constructed and questionable account of the purposes of education and the \nother which defines precisely those conditions of \u2018reality\u2019 which are too often over-\nlooked.  In the early years of the twentieth century James Joyce was inspired to write \nhis great novel Ulysses by the presence of his muse, Nora Barnacle, a woman who \nlived an \u2018ordinary\u2019, otherwise unexceptional life in Galway. Joyce did not , therefore, \nlook to a fantasy version of womanhood, or fictional women, for his inspiration. This \nexample, of the meeting of  the everyday and the extraordinary ,offers us important \nways of defining our relationship with the \u2018real\u2019. Joyce did not look at , or think about \nNora Barnacle in terms of attempting to render a precise picture of a human being. On \nthe contrary, he looked at the \u2018real\u2019 in order to find ways of thinking about what might \nbe, what could be, and what was possible. Rather than turning to the existent social \nworld in order to curtail the imagination he used it as a place from which to construct \npossibility. In this we can see something of the way in which we might both resist \nhomogenising versions of the \u2018real\u2019 and turn instead to those accounts which allow us \nto develop the visions and the varieties of human intelligence. \n \n \n \n \nReferences \n \n1.
