The global economic crisis is creating the toughest jobs environment for a \ngeneration (BBC, 2010; Higher Education Careers Service Unit, 2010) and in the third quarter \nof 2010, 20% of new graduates were reported to be unemployed (Office for National Statistics, \n2011). Since August 2010, universities in the UK are required to include a statement about \nthe employability of their graduates on the Unistats website (http:\/\/unistats.direct.gov.uk) and, \nfrom September 2012, employment and salary data will form part of the Key Information Set \n(KIS) data that Universities will need to publish for potential students (http:\/\/www.hefce.ac.uk\/\nlearning\/infohe\/kis.htm). \nWhat is employability? \nThe most widely accepted definition sees employability as \u201ca set of achievements \u2013 skills, \nunderstandings and personal attributes \u2013 that makes graduates more likely to gain employment \nand be successful in their chosen occupations, which benefits themselves, the workforce, the \ncommunity and the economy\u201d (Yorke, 2006: p8).\nMany observers have rightly stressed the skills dimension within this definition, but it is important \nnot to overlook the clause \u201c...in their chosen occupations\u201d. The range of careers that can follow \nfrom a biology-related course is a potentially attractive feature of such degrees. However, \nstudents are often unaware of the diversity of roles that they might pursue and struggle to \nsee beyond the familiar ambitions to head into laboratory-based research, school teaching or \nfurther training as a medical doctor. Careers awareness is therefore an important component \nof employability and is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the Careers After Biological Sciences programme \nat Leicester University.\nKeywords: Employability, alumni, careers education, web 2.0, careers awareness\nVolume 18: December 2011 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol18\/beej-18-3SE.pdf\nSpecial Edition\nThe present paper charts the evolution of this series of careers events for bioscience students \nand the parallel development of an open access repository of careers talks and other careers \neducation resources. The account serves two purposes. Firstly, it brings to the readers\u2019 attention \nan established and growing archive of career profiles, illustrating the diversity of jobs that can \nfollow a bioscience degree. Secondly, it provides practical suggestions for colleagues interested \nin adapting our model to produce bespoke careers materials for their own institutional context, \nwith an emphasis on the value of social media within this process.\nDevelopment of the Careers After Biological Sciences (CABS) programme\nOn top of the global justifications for enhancing the provision of careers education for our \nstudents, an academic review of Biological Science at Leicester, conducted on behalf of the \nQuality Assurance Agency in Spring 2006, reported that \u201csome students have expressed a wish \nfor additional careers sessions to be provided specifically for Biological Sciences students.\u201d \nFurthermore, it was noted that \u201cStudents\u2026would like additional advice on careers-related \nissues. Whilst the School does provide advice in this area consideration should be given \nto ways in which it can be enhanced since current provision is not keeping up with student \ndemand.\u201d In consequence, the inspection team included improvement of careers advice as \none of six recommendations arising from their visit.\nIn addition to the enhancement of employability skills teaching, both within and external to \nthe formal curriculum, a model for provision of careers awareness seminars was devised. \nFollowing a successful application to the institutional Fund for New Teaching Initiatives, the \nCareers After Biological Sciences programme was launched in 2007. \nTiming of careers events\nFrom its inception, CABS was envisaged as a series of extra-curricular seminars. There were \nseveral reasons for the decision to run this programme outside the formal timetable. We were \nkeen that the CABS sessions should be accessible to as many students, across all years of \nthe course, that wished to attend. However, the curriculum for students of biological science is \nalready very congested. Coupled with this, the flexibility in selection of module combinations \nin the second and final years of our degrees mean that there are few available timeslots \nwithin the working week where teaching was not already occurring. Additionally, the value \nof \u201cnon-credit-bearing special events\u201d has previously been identified in the careers literature \n(e.g. Watts, 2006: p18).\nDuring the initial years of the CABS programme, seminars were therefore organised as \u201ctwilight\u201d \nsessions, with two presenters in a one-hour slot between 5 and 6pm, on a set day each week, \nover a four or five week period. This had the advantages both that students ought to be flexible \nto attend and that speakers would generally need to miss only a half-day of work in order to \ncome and speak. \nThis arrangement, however, had the disadvantage that only two topics would be covered in any \none session and, as will be explained below, this was ultimately considered to be a significant \nweakness in promoting awareness of a diversity of possible careers. In the most recent years \nwe have therefore move from having five weeks with two talks per week (the \u201c5 x 2 model\u201d) \nto having five talks on two consecutive Wednesday afternoons (the \u201c2 x 5 model\u201d). The latter \nis not a perfect solution since it discriminates against students with sports commitments, but \non balance this was felt to be the lesser of two evils (not least because the talks are now all \nrecorded in some format).\nVolume 18: December 2011 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol18\/beej-18-3SE.pdf\nSpecial Edition\nChoosing and contacting potential speakers\nIn the initial design of the CABS programme a decision was made that all presenters would be \nbioscience graduates from our own institution. We have allowed some deviation from this model \nto permit key \u201cgatekeepers\u201d such as the local admissions tutor from the School of Education, the \nDirector of Postgraduate Research and the Sub-Dean of Medicine to talk about applications to \nPost-Graduate Certificate of Education courses, PhDs and Medicine, respectively. Apart from \nthese we have stuck to the rule that only alumni can be speakers. Although this is theoretically \nlimiting if, for example, we were keen to discuss a particular vocation but were not aware of any \nformer student working in that field, we have nonetheless felt that it was an important benefit to \ninvite only our own alumni since they are de facto the embodiment that it is possible to reach \n\u201ctheir chosen occupation\u201d from the essentially the same starting point.\nA variety of strategies have been used to contact potential speakers. Some were undergraduate \ncontemporaries of the author, who is himself an alumnus of the University. Others were \ngraduates with whom the author or another member of staff has kept in active touch over the \nperiod since they completed their initial degree. Some contacts have been opportunistic, for \nexample when the biography accompanying an article written by an alumnus included details \nof their undergraduate course. \nSocial media, such as Facebook (www.facebook.com) and latterly LinkedIn (www.linkedin.\ncom), have also proven valuable tools for getting back in contact with former students (see \nBox 1). Searching of both services works best when tracking down students with unusual \nnames. It is less successful when trying to become reacquainted with alumni that have common \nnames. The fact that many female graduates change their surname after marriage also limits \nthe effectiveness of this approach. \nBox 1 Web2.0 tools used during the CABS project (free unless stated)\nFacebook.com The archetypal \u2018social networking\u2019 site.

Subscription service allows for addition of other features, e.g. video\nTwitter.com \u2018Microblogging\u2019 service, used to advertise the publication of new careers \nposts on the CABS site\nVimeo.com Video-hosting service. Not as well-known as YouTube, but even basic \nmembership allows you to upload longer films (maximum weekly allowance 500 MB is \neasily sufficient to cope with a 30 minute video)\nWordpress.com Blogging service, pivotal hub that hosts the Bioscience Careers website \nand allows easy integration of slides, videos and audio resources \nYouTube.com Archetypal video-sharing service. Better known than Vimeo, but standard \nmembership has a maximum length of 15 min. Used here for bespoke work-place \ninterviews, but too short for videos of presentations\nRecognising these limitations, since 2011 we have coordinated a bioscience alumni group on \nFacebook. The group presently has over 240 members. Membership is a benefit to the former \nstudents since we use the group as a channel to update them with news from the School of \nVolume 18: December 2011 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol18\/beej-18-3SE.pdf\nSpecial Edition\nBiological Sciences. In the future it is hoped that it will also help us, by acting as a natural route \nfor identifying CABS speakers.\nThis brings into focus the question of whether there is an optimum time gap between graduation \nand giving a careers talk. This issue is something we have been aware of since the very first \nyear of CABS events at which, quite independently, two of the speakers pointed out that most \nof the audience had not been born when they were doing their degrees. Although observations \nof this kind do not negate the value of talking about a particular career, they inevitably \nemphasise a disconnection between the current and former students. As a consequence, we \nhave sought in subsequent years to target speakers five to ten years after graduation. This \nperiod of time is considered optimal since it allows the alumni to have become established \nin their role whilst having been at university sufficiently recently to maintain a resonance for \ncurrent undergraduates. This does not preclude invitations to graduates from outside this time \nframe if there is a particular reason to do so.\nAlumni are asked to prepare for involvement in one of two formats. Some are invited to serve \non a panel of people who have moved into the same field. More usually, however, they are \nasked to speak for about 20-25 minutes and to include three core pieces of information: what \ntheir current job involves; how they got there from their degree (i.e. a brief personal history); \nand top tips for anyone considering a move into the same field. They can tackle these points \nin whatever order they wish.\nCareers for consideration\nThe choice of which jobs to cover in the CABS programme has been influenced by a number \nof factors. As noted above, one of the criteria remains the availability of an alumnus able \nto talk from experience about a given role. Since there is a deliberate intention to broaden \nstudents\u2019 awareness of different occupations, we have consciously looked to include a wide \nvariety of careers (see Box 2 for a list of careers covered during the first five years of CABS). \nThe professions considered have comprised both \u201cCareers in science\u201d and \u201cCareers from \nscience\u201d (Osborne and Dillon, 2008), that is to say roles that are overtly scientific and those for \nwhich science is not a formal requirement but for which a scientifically-trained mind would be \na significant asset. \nBox 2 Careers presented during the first five years of the CABS programme\nAcademic Development Officer\nBiomedical Scientist\/Clinical Scientist (x2)\nClassroom Teacher (x2)\nClinical Trial Coordinator\nConservationist at Zoological Park\nCosmetics Developer\/Formulation \nTechnologist\nDietitian\nDoctor (talk and panel, x2)\nDrug Discovery Scientist\nEcologist\nEmbryologist\nFood production\/Management\nForensic Scientist\nLab technician\nLawyer (x2)\nLibrarian\nManufacturing Scientist\nMicrobiological Services Manager\nNurse\nPhD students (talk and panel, x2)\nPolice Officer (x2)\nPostdoctoral Researcher\/Research Associate \n(x2)\nResearch Administrator\nScience writer\/Journalist\nTeacher Trainer\nWelfare Officer\nVolume 18: December 2011 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol18\/beej-18-3SE.pdf\nSpecial Edition\nOver the lifetime of the CABS series, however, it has become clear that a tension exists \nbetween students\u2019 natural interest and the stated ambition of the programme to enhance their \nawareness of more diverse roles. Attendance at CABS events has not always been monitored; \nhowever for the 9 (out of 17) sessions for which data are available, the average (mean) turnout \nwas 45 students (range 9 to 93). Seminars that included advice regarding one of the three \n\u2018obvious\u2019 steps that can follow a bioscience degree, i.e. doing a PhD, training as a teacher or \nstudying Medicine, have always drawn the larger audiences. \nThis observation is a principal factor in the decision to move away from the \u201c5 x 2 model\u201d of two \ntalks at any one event, to the \u201c2 x 5\u201d model, in which one of the recognised roles can be used \nas the centre-piece of a session in which four lesser-known careers can also be discussed.\nDevelopment of online resources\nInevitably, it is impossible to cover all potential careers within the duration of any one student\u2019s \nundergraduate courses, let alone on an annual basis. From the outset it has therefore been \nan important facet of the CABS programme that all talks were captured in some way so as to \nbe of value to students that were unable to attend a particular session. Videos of talks given \nduring the first series of CABS events were made available to other current students via the \nBlackboard Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). However the need to have a password to \naccess the material renders the VLE an \u2018institutional silo\u2019; it excludes both our own former \nstudents and those at other universities who might benefit from hearing about the careers \ndiscussed.\nFortunately the emergence of a wide variety of interactive web-based tools (Box 1) has allowed \nfor migration of the CABS resources onto an easily-manageable platform, with access open to \nall interested parties. Since February 2009, lecture slides, audio files and\/or videos have been \norganised via the www.biosciencecareers.wordpress.com blog. Modern blogging services, \nsuch as www.wordpress.com or www.blogger.com, offer an ideal platform for aggregating \nresources; they require only minimal computing skills, provide in-built search facilities and \neasy addition of tags and other metadata. \nOn our careers blog, the PowerPoint slides from each CABS presentation (including those \ngiven in 2007 and 2008) are embedded into the main page via www.slideshare.net. In addition \nto the slides themselves, we have experimented with a variety of other media. In 2007 and 2011 \nwe made video recordings of the talks themselves. Although the notion of pointing a camera at \nthe presenter and then uploading it to the web seems straightforward, there are a number of \nissues with this approach. The principal issue is one of expense \u2013 you are likely to need some \ntechnical assistance with editing and conversion of the video into a web-suitable format and \nthis is likely to incur a fee. Videos of 15 minutes or more cannot be uploaded using a standard \nwww.youtube.com account and you will therefore need to use an alternative service. www.\nvimeo.com is highly regarded substitute and, like YouTube, allows you to embed the video \nwithin your website. Unfortunately Vimeo does not have the same degree of visibility in search \nengines as YouTube and is therefore unlikely to bring you as much opportunistic traffic.\nIf a budget is available for video work, it might be better spent on shooting short bespoke \nvideos of alumni at their place of work. We have done this on three occasions \u2013 visiting alumni \nworking in cosmetic production (http:\/\/youtu.be\/QXjO_NVay0Q), microbiological testing (http:\/\/\nyoutu.be\/GmJIVmN8K7Q) and as a medical doctor (http:\/\/youtu.be\/sYGM3y6rZz0). As shorter \npieces these can be hosted on YouTube and have received over 2100, 1670 and 2700 views \nrespectively.\nVolume 18: December 2011 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol18\/beej-18-3SE.pdf\nSpecial Edition\nAlternatives to video\nAssuming that funds are limited, a combination of audio recording and photography can be \nan effective alternative. In the absence of a video, a simple head-and-shoulders photo of the \nspeaker adds colour and personality to the core site (Figure 1). \nFigure 1 Screenshot from www.biosciencecareers.wordpress.com demonstrating the merit of adding portrait \nphotographs of speakers to the site\nAudio files are much easier to edit than video using, for example, free software available \nfrom audacity.soundforge.net or, somewhat counter-intuitively, the windows movie maker \nsoftware that comes as standard on most PCs. We previously hosted our audio recordings at \nwww.libsyn.com, a podcasting service for which a subscription was required. More recently \nSlideshare have added the capacity to synchronise lecture recordings with slide presentations \nas part of their free service. Uploading of these \u201cslidecasts\u201d gives users of the CABS website \nthe opportunity to skim through the slides in isolation of to listen to the talk at the same time. \nWe are currently in the process of linking audio files to our existing slide sequences. \nAdditionally, in 2012 we will be including student-authored reports of the talks on the website. \nThis will not only reinforce the student-centred nature of the site but will provide something that \nthose whose text is selected can include in their own curriculum vitae.\nSummary of recommendations \nOur website www.biosciencecareers.wordpress.com is already available for staff and students \nat other universities to use. In the light of our experience over the past five years, the following \nadvice is offered for anyone considering establishing a CABS-style programme for their own \ninstitution.\nWho: Alumni, especially those 5 to 10 years after graduation, demonstrate de facto careers that \ncan stem from the very courses undergraduates are currently pursuing. Academic colleagues \nmay be able to recommend potential speakers, but Web2.0 tools such as Facebook and \nLinkedIn can also prove valuable.\nVolume 18: December 2011 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol18\/beej-18-3SE.pdf\nSpecial Edition\nEvents: If the intention is to expose students to a broad range of careers, organise an afternoon \nwith 5 or 6 speakers. Include a range of Careers from Science as well as Careers in Science, \nbut ensure that the programme features at least one \u201cexpected\u201d career (e.g. PhD, medicine, \nteaching) as this will encourage greater attendance. A tea-break offers an opportunity to \nrefresh the mind and to put informal questions to the speakers, but also offers an opportunity \nfor escape, so think carefully about the order of the presentations. As a minimum, you should \naim to take a photo of the speakers, keep a copy of their slides and make an audio recording \nof the talk (it is best to forewarn speakers that these are your intentions and to give them the \nright of veto over one, two or all three of these components).\nPost-event resources: A blog can serve as a hub for archiving resources. Wordpress or \nBlogger host free and easy to use websites. Content of the site could include: slides from \nthe talk, audio recording (possibly synched with the slides) and a photograph of the speaker. \nWritten summaries of the talks (written by students), videos of the talks and\/or shot on location \nwith the speakers at their workplace are also possible.\nConclusions\nCareers education is a broader task than careers awareness. Amidst the clamour to develop \nemployability skills, however, it is important that the provision of \u201copportunity awareness\u201d is not \noverlooked. This is particularly important for students in the bioscience disciplines for whom \nidentification of potential career paths may be less clear than for undergraduates studying \nmore vocational subjects. \nOver the past five years, the CABS events have become an integral part of the careers provision \nat the University of Leicester. A recent employability survey conducted with students completing \ntheir bioscience course in 2011 (n=118, 72% of cohort) and staff (n= 48, 50% of faculty) included \nquestions about awareness of CABS events and an estimation of their importance. Using \na 5-point Likert scale from \u201cStrongly disagree\u201d (score -2) through to \u201cStrongly agree\u201d (+2), \nstudents rated their awareness of the CABS events at 1.03 and their importance as 1.22 and \nstaff scored 0.73 and 1.25 respectively (Mark Goodwin, personal communication).\nThe CABS approach offers a way to build a body of discipline- and context-specific material for \nuse by present, past and future undergraduates. Although developed here for bioscientists, the \nCABS model could readily be adapted for use with students of other courses.\nAcknowledgements\nI am grateful to the University of Leicester\u2019s Fund for New Teaching Initiatives for covering \nthe costs associated with the initial development of the CABS programme.
