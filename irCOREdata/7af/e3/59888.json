Evaluating the impact of agriculture on climate there-3\nfore requires a capacity to predict N2O emissions in relation to environmental conditions and4\ncrop management. Biophysical models simulating the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in agro-5\necosystems have a unique potential to explore these relationships, but are fraught with high6\nuncertainties in their parameters due to their variations over time and space. Here, we used a7\nBayesian approach to calibrate the parameters of the N2O submodel of the agro-ecosystem model8\nCERES-EGC. The submodel simulates N2O emissions from the nitrification and denitrification9\nprocesses, which are modelled as the product of a potential rate with three dimensionless factors10\nrelated to soil water content, nitrogen content and temperature. These equations involve a total11\nset of 15 parameters, four of which are site-specific and should be measured on site, while the12\nother 11 are considered global, i.e. invariant over time and space. We first gathered prior informa-13\ntion on the model parameters based on literature review, and assigned them uniform probability14\ndistributions. A Bayesian method based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm was subsequently15\ndeveloped to update the parameter distributions against a database of seven different field-sites16\nin France. Three parallel Markov chains were run to ensure a convergence of the algorithm. This17\nsite-specific calibration significantly reduced the spread in parameter distribution, and the un-18\ncertainty in the N2O simulations. The model\u2019s root mean square error (RMSE) was also abated19\nby 73% across the field sites compared to the prior parameterization. The Bayesian calibration20\nwas subsequently applied simultaneously to all data sets, to obtain better global estimates for21\nthe parameters initially deemed universal. This made it possible to reduce the RMSE by 33%22\non average, compared to the uncalibrated model.

Because of its heavy reliance on synthetic N-fertilisers, agricul-3\nture has enhanced these two processes, as a result of which agro-ecosystems contribute 55-65%4\nof the global anthropogenic emissions of N2O. Compared to other ecosystem types or economic5\nsectors, they are thus responsible for the major part of the atmospheric build-up of N2O (Smith6\net al., 2007). Compared to other greenhouse gases (GHG) such as CO2, N2O fluxes are of small7\nmagnitude and highly variable in space and time, being tightly linked to the local climatic se-8\nquence and soil properties. Predicting N2O emissions from agro-ecosystems thus requires taking9\ninto account complex processes and interactions which originate from both environmental con-10\nditions and agricultural practises (Duxbury and Bouldin, 1982; Grant and Pattey, 2003; Pattey11\net al., 2007). This poses a serious challenge to the estimation of the source strength of arable12\nsoils, which is currently mostly based on available statistics on fertilizer ignoring these environ-13\nmental factors (IPCC, 2006; Lokupitiya and Paustian, 2006). On the other hand, process-based14\nagro-ecosystem models may in principle capture these effects, and have thereby a unique poten-15\ntial to predict N2O emissions from arable soils at the plot-scale as well as at regional and con-16\ntinental scales (Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2004; Li et al., 2001; Gabrielle et al., 2006a; Del Grosso17\net al., 2006). Examples of biophysical N2O-models include DAYCENT (Parton et al., 2001),18\nDNDC (Li, 2000), FASSET (Chatskikh et al., 2005) and CERES-EGC (Gabrielle et al., 2006b).19\nHowever, a major limitation to the wide-spread use of these models lies in the fact that their20\npredictions are highly dependent on parameter settings, and carry a large uncertainty due to un-21\ncertainties in parameter values, driving variables and model structure (Gabrielle et al., 2006a).22\nAlthough model parameterisation and uncertainty analysis are widely developed in the litera-23\nture on agro-ecosystem models, they are rarely considered simultaneously (Monod et al., 2006;24\n3\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nMakowski et al., 2006). Bayesian calibration makes it possible to combine the two types of anal-1\nysis by providing estimates of parameters values under the form of probability density functions2\n(pdfs), which may be also propagated to model outputs as pdfs (Gallagher and Doherty, 2007).3\nProbability density functions are initially the expression of current imprecise knowledge about4\nmodel parameter values, this prior probability is then updated with the measured observations5\ninto posterior probability distribution by means of Bayes\u2019 theorem (Makowski et al., 2006).6\nIn ecological and environmental sciences, Bayesian calibration has been applied to a wide range7\nof models (Hong et al., 2005; Larssen et al., 2006; Ricciuto et al., 2008), and this field is de-8\nveloping actively, mainly using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to estimate the9\nposterior pdf for the model parameters. The Bayesian methodology described by Van Oijen et al.10\n(2005) was applied to dynamic process-based forest models with the objective of calibrating11\nmodel parameters with various types of observed data from forested experimental sites (Svens-12\nson et al., 2008; Klemedtsson et al., 2007). In these examples, Metropolis-Hastings MCMC-13\nalgorithm was used to generate samples from the posterior parameter distributions. Although14\nthere is an increasing body of literature on the application of Bayesian approaches to environ-15\nmental sciences, the latter have not been applied to process-based model of soil N2O emission16\nmodels, to the best of our knowledge.17\nThe overall purpose of this paper was thus to calibrate the parameters of the N2O emission mod-18\nule of the CERES-EGC agro-ecosystem model and to quantify uncertainty of model simulations19\nby developing a suitable Bayesian calibration method. Data sets of measured N2O emission rates20\nwere collected from seven field-sites in Northern France, which represent major soil types, crops21\nand management practices of the area. The Bayesian procedure was first applied separately to22\neach experimental site, and secondly to the ensemble of the sites. This made it possible to ex-23\nplore the spatial variability of model parameters, and to test whether they could be considered as24\nuniversal and with which uncertainty range.25\n4\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\n2 Material and Methods1\nWe carried out Bayesian calibration using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, to estimate the2\njoint probability distribution for the parameters of the N2O emission module of the CERES-3\nEGC model. The equations of this module involve 15 parameters, of which 11 were considered4\nas global (i.e. invariant over time and space) by the model\u2019s author, the remaining 4 being site-5\nspecific (He\u00b4nault et al., 2005). While the latter were laboratory-measured in all experimental6\nsites and set to the resulting values throughout, the subset of 11 global parameters was estimated7\nby our Bayesian procedure. We collated a database of N2O flux measurements including 78\ndifferent field-sites in France, and various N fertilizer forms and rates in 2 of the sites. Bayesian9\ncalibration was applied either to each site or treatment individually, or directly to the ensemble10\nof the data sets.11\n2.1 The CERES-EGC model12\n2.1.1 A process-based agro-ecosystem model13\nCERES-EGC was adapted from the CERES suite of soil-crop models (Jones and Kiniry, 1986),14\nwith a focus on the simulation of environmental outputs such as nitrate leaching, emissions of15\nN2O and nitrogen oxides (Gabrielle et al., 2006a). CERES-EGC runs on a daily time step, and16\nrequires daily rain, mean air temperature and Penman potential evapo-transpiration as forcing17\nvariables. The CERES models are available for a large number of crop species, which share the18\nsame soil components (Jones and Kiniry, 1986).19\nCERES-EGC comprises sub-models for the major processes governing the cycles of water, car-20\nbon and nitrogen in soil-crop systems. A physical sub-model simulates the transfer of heat, water21\nand nitrate down the soil profile, as well as soil evaporation, plant water uptake and transpiration22\nin relation to climatic demand. Water infiltrates down the soil profile following a tipping-bucket23\napproach, and may be redistributed upwards after evapo-transpiration has dried some soil layers.24\n5\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nIn both of these equations, the generalised Darcy\u2019s law has subsequently been introduced in order1\nto better simulate water dynamics in fine-textured soils (Gabrielle et al., 1995).2\nA biological sub-model simulates the growth and phenology of the crops. Crop net photosynthe-3\nsis is a linear function of intercepted radiation according to the Monteith approach, with intercep-4\ntion depending on leaf are index based on Beer\u2019s law of diffusion in turbid media. Photosynthates5\nare partitioned on a daily basis to currently growing organs (roots, leaves, stems, fruits) accord-6\ning to crop development stage. The latter is driven by the accumulation of growing degree days,7\nas well as cold temperature and day-length for crops sensitive to vernalisation and photoperiod.8\nLastly, crop N uptake is computed through a supply\/demand scheme, with soil supply depending9\non soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations and root length density.10\nA micro-biological sub-model simulates the turnover of organic matter in the plough layer. De-11\ncomposition, mineralisation and N-immobilisation are modelled with three pools of organic mat-12\nter (OM): the labil OM, the microbial biomass and the humads. Kinetic rate constants define the13\nC and N flows between the different pools. Direct field emissions of CO2, N2O, NO and NH314\ninto the atmosphere are simulated with different trace gas modules.15\n2.1.2 The nitrous oxide emission module16\nThis module simulates the production of N2O in soils through both the nitrification and the17\ndenitrification pathways, and was adapted from the semi-empirical model NOE (He\u00b4nault et al.,18\n2005). The denitrification component is derived from the NEMIS model (He\u00b4nault and Germon,19\n2000) that calculates the actual denitrification rate (Da, kg N ha\u22121 d\u22121) as the product of a20\npotential rate at 20 \u00b0C (PDR, kg N ha\u22121 d\u22121) with three unitless factors related to water-filled21\npore space (FW ), nitrate content (FN ) and temperature (FT ) in the topsoil, as follows:22\nDa = PDR FN FW FT (1)\n6\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nIn a similar fashion, the daily nitrification rate (Ni, kg N ha\u22121 d\u22121) is modelled as the product1\nof a maximum nitrification rate at 20 \u00b0C (MNR, kg N ha\u22121 d\u22121) with three unitless factors2\nrelated to water-filled pore space (NW ), ammonium concentration (NN ) and temperature (NT )3\nand expressed as follows:4\nNi = MNR NN NW NT (2)\nNitrous oxide emissions resulting from the two processes are soil-specific proportions of total5\ndenitrification and nitrification pathways, and are calculated according to:6\nN2O = r Da+ c Ni (3)\nwhere r is the fraction of denitrified N and c is the fraction of nitrified N that both evolve as N2O.7\nThe N2O sub-model of CERES-EGC involves a total set of 15 parameters of which four of them8\nare site-specific and must be measured on site, while the other 11 are considered global, i.e. in-9\nvariant over time and space. The local (site-specific) parameters are the potential denitrification10\nrate (PDR), the maximum nitrification rate (MNR) and the fractions of nitrified (c) and denitri-11\nfied (r) N that are evolved as N2O. They were measured in the laboratory for all sites using a12\nprotocol that proved representative of field conditions in a wide range of situations (He\u00b4nault and13\nGermon, 2000; He\u00b4nault et al., 2005; Gabrielle et al., 2006b; Dambreville et al., 2008). The 1114\nglobal parameters are the constants of the N2O module equations which are considered invariant15\nover time and space. They were estimated by He\u00b4nault and Germon (2000) for the denitrification16\npathway and by Garrido et al. (2002) and Laville et al. (2005) for nitrification. The equations of17\nthe response functions with the associated parameters are described in Appendix A (Eqs. 7-12).18\nPrior information was gathered on all parameters on a literature review. For lack of information19\non the form of the pdf of these parameters, the latter were assigned uniform distributions within20\ntheir likely range derived from literature data (Table 1). Parameters were supposed to be en-21\ntirely independent (i.e. non-correlated). This type of hypotheses, which are likely to be violated22\n7\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nin ecosystem models, is not a significant issue in the application of Bayesian calibration. For1\nexample, Naud et al. (2007) tested different levels of correlation of prior distributions and con-2\ncluded that correlation was not a very important factor. In addition, Hong et al. (2005) reported3\nthat the assumption of a priori independence does not imply independence a posteriori, and the4\ncalibration may still provide a posterior estimate of correlations across parameters.5\n2.2 The database of N2O measurements6\nThe N2O measurements were carried out on seven experimental sites located in Northern France.7\nThe experiments were conducted on major arable crop types and soils types representative of8\nthis part of France. For some sites, different treatments were conducted with various N-fertiliser9\namounts supplied to the crop, giving a total of 11 site\/treatment combinations (Table 2). Nitrous10\noxide emissions were monitored by the static chamber method with eight replicates for all sites11\n(He\u00b4nault et al., 2005), except at Grignon where measurements were monitored with three auto-12\nmatic chambers during 31 successive days from 13 May 2005 to 12 June 2005 (Lehuger et al.,13\n2007). The variance in the measurements was estimated as the variance across the different14\nreplicate chambers in the field. Soil nitrogen and moisture contents were monitored in the soil15\nprofile for each site with different sampling frequencies (see references of Table 2 for details).16\nThe resulting samples were analysed for moisture content and inorganic N using colorimetric17\nsamples in the laboratory. Soil temperature was continuously monitored using thermocouples in18\nmost of the sites, except for the sites of Champnoe\u00a8l and Le Rheu. The input data required to run19\nthe model were also collected in each site: the weather data were taken from a local meteorolog-20\nical station, and detailed information on soil properties and crop management were compiled to21\ngenerate CERES-EGC input files using a standard parameterization procedure (Gabrielle et al.,22\n2006b). Uncertainty on these input data was not considered here since CERES-EGC had already23\nbeen tested in most of the sites (Gabrielle et al., 2006b). Besides, it likely had little impact on24\n8\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nthe N2O simulations since we checked that the model gave correct predictions of the major N2O1\ndrivers (topsoil environmental conditions and nitrate content).2\n2.3 Bayesian calibration3\n2.3.1 Markov Chain Monte Carlo4\nBayesian methods are used to estimate model parameters by combining two sources of infor-5\nmation: prior information about parameter values and observations on output variables. The6\nprior information is based on expert knowledge, literature review or by measuring parameters7\ndirectly in the field or laboratory. In our case, the observations on output variables are field mea-8\nsurements of the different fluxes between soil-crop-atmosphere compartments. Bayes\u2019 theorem9\nmakes it possible to combine the two sources of information in order to calibrate the model pa-10\nrameters. The first step is to assign a probability distribution to the parameters, representing our11\nprior uncertainty about their values. In our case, we specified lower and upper bounds of the pa-12\nrameters uncertainty, defining the prior parameter distributions as uniform. The aim of Bayesian13\ncalibration is to reduce this uncertainty by using the measured data, thereby producing the poste-14\nrior distribution for the parameters. This is achieved by multiplying the prior with the likelihood15\nfunction, which is the probability of the data given the parameters. The likelihood function is16\ndetermined by the probability distribution of errors in observations. We assumed errors to be17\nindependent and normally distributed with mean zero following Van Oijen et al. (2005) and in18\nthe same fashion as Svensson et al. (2008) and Klemedtsson et al. (2007). Because probability19\ndensities may be very small numbers, rounding errors needed to be avoided and all calculations20\nwere carried out using logarithms. The logarithm of the data likelihood is thus set up, for each21\ndata set Yi, as follows:22\nlogLi =\nK\u2211\nj=1\n(\n\u22120.5\n(\nyj \u2212 f(\u03c9i; \u03b8i)\n\u03c3j\n)2\n\u2212 0.5log(2pi)\u2212 log(\u03c3j)\n)\n(4)\n9\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nwhere yj is the mean N2O flux measured on sampling date j in the data set Yi and \u03c3j the standard1\ndeviation across the replicates on that date, \u03c9i is the vector of model input data for the same2\ndate, f(\u03c9i; \u03b8i) is the model simulation of yj with the parameter vector \u03b8i, and K is the total3\nnumber of observation dates in the data sets. To generate a representative sample of parameter4\nvectors from the posterior distribution, we used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method:5\nthe Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Metropolis et al., 1953) (see Appendix B for details). We6\nformed Markov chains of length 104-105 using a multivariate Gaussian pdf to generate candidate7\nparameter vectors. The variance matrix of this Gaussian was tuned so that the Markov chains8\nwould explore parameter space efficiently. We followed the procedure of Van Oijen et al. (2005)9\nand defined the variances equal to the square of 1 to 5 % of the prior parameter range (\u03b8min-\u03b8max)10\nand zero covariances. Subsequently, the variances were tuned so that the fraction of candidates11\naccepted during the random walk was between 20 to 30%. Ten percent of the total number12\nof iterations at the beginning of the chain were discarded as unrepresentative \u201cburn-in\u201d of the13\nchains (Van Oijen et al., 2005). For each calibration, three parallel Markov chains were started14\nfrom three different starting points (\u03b80): the default parameter value and their lower and upper15\nbounds (\u03b8min and \u03b8max). Convergence was checked with the diagnostic proposed by Gelman and16\nRubin (1992), which is based on the comparison of within-chain and between-chain variances,17\nand is similar to a classical analysis of variance. Convergence is reached when variance between18\nchains no longer exceeds the variance within each individual chain. The chains of parameter19\nvalues resulting from the random walk of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm are auto-correlated20\nbecause each iteration depends on the previous one. We therefore thinned the chains in two21\nsteps: the auto-correlation was first computed for increasing lags and then the posterior chain22\nwas extracted by keeping the iterations defined by the thinning interval. We defined this as the23\nnumber of iterations between consecutive samples in a chain for which the auto-correlation was24\nless than 60%. The chains filtered in this way were considered to be a representative sample from25\n10\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nthe posterior pdf, and from this sample were calculated the mean vector, the variance matrix and1\nthe 90% confident interval for each parameter.2\nThe generation and analysis of the Markov chains were carried out with the statistical package3\nR (R Development Core Team, 2008) and in particular its coda package (Plummer et al., 2006).4\nThe CERES-EGC model was encapsulated within R as a library, generated from the original5\nFortran code.6\n2.3.2 Procedure for the N2O module7\nThe calibration procedure had two main objectives: (i) to calibrate the parameters for each dataset8\nYi, to explore the variations of global parameters across experimental sites and treatments, and9\n(ii) to obtain better estimates for the global parameters (initially deemed universal in the model).10\nThe first objective was pursued by calibrating the parameters for each data set separately, which is11\nreferred to later on as the dataset-by-dataset procedure. In a second step, the global parameters12\nwere calibrated by running our procedure with the 11 data sets simultaneously (multi-dataset13\nprocedure), i.e. by calculating the posterior distribution as:14\np(\u03b8|Y1, ..., Y11) \u221d p(Y1, ..., Y11|\u03b8) p(\u03b8) (5)\nwhere Yi is the data of the ith site and the \u221d symbol means \u2019proportional to\u2019. In this case, the15\nlog-likelihood is calculated as the sum of the log-likelihoods of all the data sets (for a given16\nparameter set in the MCMC chain).17\n2.4 Evaluation of model predictions18\nThe performance of the calibration procedures was assessed by calculating the root mean square19\nerror (RMSE). RMSE was defined, for each data set Yi, as follows (Smith et al., 1996):20\nRMSE =\n\u221a\u2211K\nj=1(yj \u2212 f(\u03c9i; \u03b8i))\n2\nK\n(6)\n11\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nIn both following cases, simulations f(\u03c9i; \u03b8i) were carried out using either the posterior ex-1\npectancy of parameters (\u03b8) or the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of \u03b8 (\u03b8MAP ). \u03b8MAP2\nis the single best value of the parameter vector in each MCMC chain, at which the posterior3\nprobability distribution is maximal (Van Oijen et al., 2005). In the case of prior parameter pdfs,4\nthe simulations were defined as the prior expectancy of the model predictions in which parame-5\nters were randomly drawn from the prior pdfs. For the posterior parameters pdfs, the simulations6\nwere the posterior expectancy of predictions. RMSE was computed after calibration resulting7\nfrom the dataset-by-dataset or multi-dataset procedure.8\n3 Results9\n3.1 Simulation of soil state variables10\nSoil temperature, soil water content and nitrate and ammonium contents were simulated by the11\nmodel and confronted against the measurements. Table 3 summarizes the mean deviation (MD),12\nwhich is the mean difference between measurement and simulation, and RMSEs computed with13\nthe different topsoil state variables used as input variables of the N2O emission module. Soil14\ntemperature and water content were well predicted by the model with RMSE ranging from 1.215\nto 3.0 \u00b0 C for the soil temperature and from 3 to 6 % (v\/v) for the soil water content across the16\n11 sites and treatments. The model\u2019s RMSE over the 11 sites and treatments ranged between17\n3.7 to 27.9 kg N ha\u22121 for the prediction of nitrate content and to 0.7 to 25.3 kg N ha\u22121 for the18\nammonium content. Dynamics of surface nitrate and ammonium contents were mainly driven by19\nthe fertiliser applications and mineralization of crop residues. Ammonium was rapidly nitrified20\nacross all the sites but the model failed to reproduce the background topsoil ammonium stock.21\nNitrate content was relatively well simulated except for 3 treatments for which N plant uptake22\nwas under-estimated (La Saussaye, Champnoe\u00a8l AN and Le Rheu AN).23\n12\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\n3.2 Posterior parameter distributions1\nFigure 1 shows boxplots of the posterior parameter distributions after calibration with the dataset-2\nby-dataset and the multi-dataset procedures. Such representation makes it possible to visualize3\ndifferences between parameter pdfs across datasets, while the shape of the boxplot reveals the4\ndispersion and symmetry of the marginal distributions. Our Bayesian procedure generally gen-5\nerated uni-modal distributions, and convergence test corroborated that the MCMC chains con-6\nverged. Figure 2 presents the 50 and 97.5% quantiles of the Gelman-Rubin shrink factor for the7\n11 parameters calibrated with the data set of La Saussaye, and shows that it approached 1 for all8\nparameters, evidencing the convergence of the calibration.9\nFigure 1 shows that the posterior distributions became narrower compared to the uniform prior10\ndistributions, which is undoubtedly due to the efficiency of our calibration procedure. The pos-11\nterior pdfs converged to normal or log normal distributions, as already observed by Svensson12\net al. (2008) in the Bayesian calibration of a process-based forest model. Thus, the choice of13\nan uniform distribution for the prior pdfs had little influence, as the information contained in14\nthe experimental data gradually became dominant in the calibration process (Van Oijen et al.,15\n2005). For example, the posterior distributions of parameter \u03b81 (the WFPS threshold triggering16\ndenitrification) had a narrow range for all datasets, suggesting that the calibration had drastically17\nreduced its uncertainty. On the contrary, parameters \u03b88 and \u03b89 (corresponding to the minimum18\nand maximum WFPS for nitrification activity, respectively) remained spread across their prior19\nrange of variation, and centered around their prior median. This means that the calibration did20\nnot significantly reduce their uncertainty. Conversely, some posterior distributions were flattened21\non one of the prior bounds, implying that their optimal values was outside the prescribed range.22\nThis was particular true for parameters \u03b810 (the half-saturation constant of nitrification response23\nto ammonium) and \u03b811 (the Q10 factor for nitrification) for the data sets of Champnoe\u00a8l AN, La24\nSaussaye and Grignon. We should therefore reconsider the prior ranges for these parameters.25\n13\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nThe rightmost boxplot in each of the 11 graphs in Figure 1 depicts the distribution obtained with1\nthe multi-dataset procedure. The shape of this boxplot and its median value appeared to be more2\nconstrained by certain datasets than others, which may be explained by the fact that data sets3\nwith a comparatively larger number of observations of higher precision had substantially more4\nweight in the log-likelihood function. For example, the boxplots of the multi-dataset calibration5\nexhibited high similarity with those of the La Saussaye site for parameters \u03b81, \u03b83 and \u03b86.6\nSome data sets were collected in the same sites, i.e. under identical climate patterns and soil7\ntypes but with differentiated crop management (the Rafidin, Le Rheu and Champnoe\u00a8l datasets).8\nSince the parameters of the N2O module are mostly related to soil properties, it was expected9\nthat the calibration should produce similar distributions for these three sites. To a certain extent,10\nthis was the case for the parameters \u03b82, \u03b83 and \u03b86, giving support to the idea that these param-11\neters are mostly soil-dependent, and are little influenced by crop management. Conversely, the12\nstrong variation of posterior pdfs across sites challenges the original idea in model development13\nthat these parameters may be considered constant. The purpose of the multi-dataset procedure14\nsought to investigate this option, by seeking the best-fit parameter pdfs in relation to the en-15\nsemble of the experimental situations collated in our database. It could be expected to lead to16\nparameter pdfs with a wider spread (and thus higher uncertainty) than in the dataset-by-dataset17\ncalibration, owing to the wide ranges covered by the dataset-specific pdfs. While this was true18\nof some parameters (e.g., \u03b84, \u03b85, and \u03b87), it was the opposite for others (most notably \u03b81 and \u03b83).19\nFigure 3 depicts the ranges of response functions of the N2O emission module resulting from the20\nvarious calibrations, and evidences ample differences across datasets. The responses of nitrifi-21\ncation to soil ammonium content (NN , Fig. 3.a) were highly variable, reflecting the range taken22\nby their shape parameter \u03b810. The response of nitrification to soil WFPS (NW , Fig. 3.b) shows23\nthat the minimum WFPS for nitrification activity (\u03b88) were centred on a unique value, while the24\noptimum WFPS (\u03b87) was lower in the calibration with two data sets. The calibrated maximum25\n14\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nWFPSs for nitrification (\u03b89) were centred on 90%. The shapes of the response function NT (Fig.1\n3.c) were similar for two sites (La Saussaye and Grignon), but strikingly different for the other2\nsites. The calibrated responses of denitrification to nitrate content (FN , Fig. 3.d) were highly3\nvariable such as the response of nitrification to ammonium content. The shapes of the response4\nof denitrification to WFPS (FW ) varied widely, as a consequence of the large variations of param-5\neters \u03b81 (the WFPS threshold triggering denitrification) and \u03b86 (the exponent of the power-law).6\nHe\u00b4nault and Germon (2000) and Heinen (2006) showed that denitrification was highly sensitive7\nto \u03b81, and that this parameter was dependent on soil type. The response of denitrification to8\nsoil temperature (FT ) had a similar shape across the various parameterizations, for temperatures9\nlower than 25 \u00b0C which corresponds to the range encountered in the field experiments. This10\nleads to the conclusion that the function calibrated with the multi-dataset procedure could be11\nconsidered universal.12\nBayesian calibration also quantifies correlations between parameters in the posterior. Most pa-13\nrameters were cross-correlated, with coefficients higher than 0.4 for 6 of them (Table 1) suggest-14\ning that our uncertainty about their values is linked and implies that some parameters should be15\ntreated in clusters, as suggested by Svensson et al. (2008). Parameters \u03b81 and \u03b82 are positively16\ncorrelated, and are both negatively correlated with \u03b86.17\n3.3 Model prediction uncertainty18\nThe simulations of N2O emissions generated with the posterior MCMC parameter chains pro-19\nvided statistical distributions of model outputs resulting from parameter uncertainty, which is20\na straight benefit of Bayesian approaches. Figure 4 shows the mean of simulated daily N2O21\nemissions for all datasets (Fig. 4.a to 4.k). Some discrepancies between measurements and sim-22\nulations remained, due to uncertainty on both sides. Measurement points with high standard23\ndeviations had less weight in the log likelihood function, and thus in the posterior probability,24\n15\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\ncompared to lower fluxes with lower variability. For example, the two N2O spikes measured in1\nVillamblain in springtime (Fig. 4.a) had a large experimental error, but did not appear to con-2\nstrain the calibration as much as the more frequent lower N2O fluxes with much lower standard3\ndeviations. The same remark applies to Arrou (Fig. 4.b). For the dataset of Champnoe\u00a8l AN (Fig.4\n4.e), a high spike of N2O was observed in autumn that the model failed to predict, whereas it5\notherwise successfully simulated fluxes under 10 g N2O-N ha\u22121 d\u22121.6\nFor the Grignon site (Fig. 4.h), the observation points were concentrated on 31 successive days7\n(from 13 May 2005 to 12 June 2005), and started a peak flux. With its default parameter set,8\nthe model simulated that peak along with two others in the following weeks that were not ob-9\nserved in the field (results not shown, see Lehuger et al. (2007)), in response to significant rains.10\nThe Bayesian calibration managed to circumvent the simulation of these two unobserved peak11\nfluxes by raising the WFPS threshold for denitrification (\u03b81) from 62% (default value) to 73%,12\nwhich is the highest value in all the calibrations (Fig. 1.a). As a result of this change in the13\nresponse to rainfall and soil water content, no N2O-peaks were simulated throughout the year14\nin Grignon (Fig. 4.h). For the dataset of Rafidin N0 (Fig. 4.i), observations also were concen-15\ntrated on two short periods, but with fewer observations points than at Grignon. The calibration16\nhighly constrained the model during the measurement period, but appeared less constraining on17\nthe N2O-fluxes outside this period.18\nTable 4 summarises the statistics of the annual N2O emissions predicted by CERES-EGC for19\nthe different datasets. The mean annual fluxes ranged between 88 and 3672 g N2O-N ha\u22121 y\u22121,20\nwith a large confidence interval especially for the datasets with higher emission rates. An overall21\nconversion factor of fertilizer inputs to N2O-N was calculated as the ratio of the annual flux to the22\nN fertiliser dose. This is different from an \u201cemission factor\u201d, which takes background emissions23\nof N2O into account. Here, we also calculated this factor as the difference between the annual24\nN2O-N emissions of fertilised and unfertilised crops (g N2O-N ha\u22121 y\u22121) to the N-fertiliser dose.25\n16\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nThe emission factors ranged from 0.05 and 1.12% across experimental sites, with a mean value1\nof 0.26%. This value is four times lower than the default value recommended by the IPCC tier 12\nmethodology (IPCC, 2006).3\n3.4 Calibration efficiency and model prediction error4\nTable 5 summarises the RMSEs obtained with the various parameters sets, and made it possi-5\nble to compare the efficiency of model calibration whether in the dataset-by-dataset or in the6\nmulti-dataset mode. In the dataset-by-dataset procedure, the RMSEs computed with the pos-7\nterior expectancy of predictions were lower than those computed with the prior expectancy of8\npredictions for all datasets except one (Arrou), with a 73% reduction on average and a maxi-9\nmum of 98% in La Saussaye. In 8 of the remaining 9 datasets, calibration lead to a reduction10\nof 79% to 96% in the model\u2019s RMSE. On average across all datasets, the RMSE dropped from11\n39 down to 6 g N2O-N ha\u22121 d\u22121 after calibration. There were no differences in the RMSEs cal-12\nculated either with simulations based on the posterior mean of parameters (\u03b8) or with posterior13\nmean of predictions. Thus, the mean of our sample from the posterior could be directly used for14\nthe sites of our database or for sites with similar soil types. The use of the parameter set with15\nmaximum posterior probability (\u03b8MAP ), i.e. when likelihood was maximum and given that we16\nused a uniform prior, logically improved the RMSE compared to the use of the posterior mean17\nof parameters (\u03b8). As could be expected, the multi-dataset calibration was less efficient than the18\ndataset-by-dataset one, enabling a decrease of only 33% of the RMSE computed with posterior19\nexpectancy of predictions compared to the prior expectancy of predictions. This would lead us20\nto believe that the parameter set summarised in Table 1 could be a good compromise when the21\nmodel will be applied for a new site.22\nIn addition, Table 5 shows that the calibration did not really improve the simulations for two23\ndatasets: Villamblain and Arrou. For both datasets, the data were not informative enough to24\n17\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nsignificantly improve parameter estimation. In the case of Arrou, the discrepancies may also1\nbe explained by the poor ability of CERES-EGC to simulate water-logging effects, as observed2\nin this experiment. The N2O module and in particular its denitrification part (Eqs. 1, 7, 8, 9 -3\nAppendix A) were already shown unable of correctly rendering the dynamics of denitrification4\nor N2O emissions for soils with high degrees of water saturation. Still, RMSE values quantify5\nthe mismatch between simulations and the mean of the measurements without taking measure-6\nment uncertainty into account, or diagnosing whether problem lies with the simulations or the7\ndata. As a consequence, RMSE values should be interpreted with caution. More in-depth model8\nevaluation would require comparing the behaviour of multiple models.9\n4 Discussion10\n4.1 Suitability and benefits of Bayesian calibration11\nOur main goal was to demonstrate the potential of a Bayesian-type calibration procedure to im-12\nprove the parameterization of a N2O-emission model, quantify parameter uncertainty and reduce13\nuncertainties of model outputs. In recent years, Bayesian calibration was successfully applied to14\nprocess-based ecosystem models, such as forest biomass growth models (Van Oijen et al., 2005;15\nSvensson et al., 2008; Klemedtsson et al., 2007). Among the various possible Bayesian methods,16\nMCMC is in principle particularly well adapted to such models (and in particular CERES-EGC)17\nbecause they can handle a high number of parameters simultaneously (Makowski et al., 2002).18\nTheir efficiency is also not hampered by a poor knowlegde of the prior distributions, as is often19\nthe case with this type of models, and may be judged from the large variation range of the param-20\neters we calibrated here. Method of expert elicitation have been recently developed and could21\nbe used in the future in order to refine prior distributions of model parameters. In short, elicita-22\ntion is the process of translating expert knowledge about uncertain quantities into a probability23\ndistribution (Oakley and O\u2019Hagan, 2007). However, no attempts had been made yet to calibrate24\n18\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nprocesses so uncertain and irregular in time and space as N2O emissions. This raised a number1\nof issues in the adaptation of the MCMC algorithm. In particular, the chains were strongly auto-2\ncorrelated, which required a substantial number of iterations (104 to 105), and drastic thinning.3\nAlso, the convergence had to be tested by running three parallel chains and using a variance-based4\ndiagnostic. An accurate simulation of the soil environmental drivers (temperature, moisture and5\nmineral N contents) was a pre-requisite for the prediction of N2O fluxes. Tests against field6\ndata showed that this condition was overall met, as noted in a previous test of CERES-EGC in a7\nsubset of the sites used here (Gabrielle et al., 2006b). In some instances, some discrepancies in8\nthe simulation of topsoil water content (Arrou) or nitrate content (La Saussaye, Champnoe\u00a8l AN9\nand Le Rheu AN) which affected the prediction of N2O fluxes. However, these errors point to10\nstructural deficiencies of the model (for instance in the simulation of soil water dynamics in the11\nwater-logged soil of Arrou), and did not interfere with the calibration. This was evidenced by12\nthe fact that inclusion of measured drivers improved model performance only marginally and in13\na few sites. This option was thus disregarded.14\nOur procedure significantly reduced parameter uncertainty for the datasets, and the uncertainty15\nin simulated N2O rates as a result. We have also established a database of N2O emissions for16\nNorthern France and in the future, it will be interesting to use this one to parameterise other mod-17\nels or to compare the performance of different N2O emissions process-based module integrated18\nin CERES-EGC. Another direction could also be to use other kind of output data to parameterise19\nspecific module, for example the use of NO emission measurements for calibration of the nitri-20\nfication sub-module (Eqs. 2, 10, 11, 12) of CERES-EGC (Rolland et al., 2008). The procedure21\nwe successfully implemented here may be readily used for other components of CERES-EGC,22\nsuch as soil C turnover or crop photosynthesis and growth.23\nThe calibration significantly reduced the model\u2019s RMSE compared with the prior parameter val-24\nues, on average by 73% with the data-by-dataset procedure and by 33% with the multi-dataset25\n19\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nprocedure. Still, the calibration did not result in a perfect match between model simulations and1\nobservations of the daily N2O fluxes. Measured data with high uncertainty were in particular2\nless well predicted because they presented a high spatial variability and consequently were less3\nconstraining in the calculation of the likelihood function. This may also be seen as an advantage4\nsince these extreme data points with large variance did not artificially influence the parameter5\nvalues compared to lower-range values with better accuracy. Heinen (2006) also showed with a6\ndifferent calibration method that the optimised denitrification sub-module did not result in per-7\nfect fit at the daily compared to the seasonal scale.8\nLastly, the dataset-by-dataset calibration points to ways of optimising calibration efficiency:9\nwhen using manual chambers, N2O measurements should be carried out at least once a month10\nthroughout the year, with a higher frequency during the peak fluxes subsequent to N-fertiliser11\nand crop residues inputs and when soil conditions are favourable to denitrification , e.g. when12\nsoil moisture, soil temperature and mineralization rate are high.13\n4.2 Spatial variability of model parameters14\nWe sought to calibrate model parameters either on a dataset-by-dataset basis in order to minimise15\nmodel error or simultaneously on all datasets to find parameter values that would be universally16\napplicable, following the premise behind the original development of the N2O model. Such17\nvalues would be extremely useful to apply the model to new soil conditions and to spatially18\nextrapolate it. However, it was suggested that simple process-based models such as the one we19\nused here needs to be parameterised on a site-specific basis (Heinen, 2006). The latter authors20\nconcluded to the impossibility of defining a set of response functions for denitrification (Eqs 1, 721\n,8, 9 - appendix A) that would equally apply to sandy, loamy and peat soil types. Our dataset-by-22\ndataset calibration gave further evidence to that statement for the N2O module of CERES-EGC,23\njudging from the large variations in parameter pdfs across sites. However, our multi-dataset24\n20\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nprocedure also demonstrated that it is still possible to find global estimates for those parameters1\nthat encompass a wide range of experimental conditions, at the cost of a higher RMSE than2\nwith optimal, site-specific parameter sets. The parameter pdfs we obtained in the multi-dataset3\ncalibration shows which parameter values would be plausible, and may thus be used to improve4\nthe accuracy of N2O simulations in new sites.5\nModels are often developed with the purpose of providing predictions over a large domain (in6\nspace and time). However, ensuring that their parameterisation is accurate is a pre-requisite to7\nsuch application. When attempting at simulating N2O fluxes in a new site where no measured8\ndata are available, the results of our calibration points to the following strategy to meet this9\nrequirement. First, the user should check if calibrated parameter sets already exist for similar10\nsoil types, based on soil taxonomy or physico-chemical characteristics. If not, the parameter11\nvalues derived from the multi-dataset calibration may be used. They may also serve as default12\nvalues for the spatial extrapolation of the model at the regional scale. In the future, new data13\nsets may be assimilated in the calibration to reduce the uncertainty of global parameters and to14\nincrease the application domain of the model. Alternatively, it is clearly advisable to favour the15\ncollection of N2O emissions data for the new sites, which lead to a much better performance16\nof the model. One last obstacle to the extrapolation of CERES-EGC lies in the 4 site-specific17\nparameters, which are supposed to be measured in the laboratory. We chose to exclude them from18\nthe calibration in accordance with the original model design. However, including them would be19\ninteresting to simulate a situation where such experimental determination is not possible, and to20\nsee to what extent it influences the outcome of the calibration. It is likely to result in different21\nparameter values since, for instance, the potential denitrification rate (a local parameter) was22\nshown to significantly correlate with three global parameters related to denitrification (Gabrielle,23\n2006). However, testing such a scenario appeared beyond the scope of this paper since it implied24\ntoo strong a deviation from the model hypotheses.25\n21\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\n4.3 Prediction of N2O fluxes from agro-ecosystems1\nCERES-EGC and its specific N2O module have already been used in a range of soil conditions2\n(He\u00b4nault et al., 2005; Dambreville et al., 2008; Heinen, 2006), and model uncertainty had only3\nbeen quantified using simple Monte Carlo techniques for a subset of 5 parameters (Gabrielle4\net al., 2006a). The effect of parameter uncertainty was seldom analysed with ecosystem models5\nsimulating N2O emissions, although (or perhaps also because) N2O measurements are fraught6\nwith a daunting spatial and temporal variability (Duxbury and Bouldin, 1982). Our Bayesian7\ncalibration resulted in a probabilistic simulation of the time course of N2O emissions taking8\nsuch variability and uncertainty into account, through their consequences on parameters\u2019 distri-9\nbutions. The calibrated model could predict daily N2O fluxes rather well, except for the highest10\npeaks with high experimental error which it failed to predict in some cases.11\nIn addition, the procedure makes it possible to quantify model output uncertainty in the calcula-12\ntion of annual N2O budget and emission factors (EFs). The model predicted annual N2O fluxes13\nwere ranging from 88 to 3672 g N2O-N ha\u22121y\u22121 over the various sites, and EFs ranging from14\n0.05 to 1.12%. On the basis of these results, alongside those of Gabrielle et al. (2006a), it ap-15\npears that the 1% default EF value of the IPCC Tier 1 methodology is not suitable for the sites we16\nstudied because it would considerably overestimate the annual emissions (Table 4). In Belgium,17\nBeheydt et al. (2007) used the DNDC model to calculate EFs corresponding to various scenarios18\ninvolving high N input levels and N surpluses, and obtained an average value of 6.49%, which19\nis 25 times higher than ours, compared to an estimate of 3.16% using the N2O measurements.20\nTheir observed emission range was an order of magnitude higher than that of our database. As-21\nsimilate such extreme data with our procedure would be helpful to enlarge the prediction range22\nof CERES-EGC, and to check its ability to predict annual emissions higher than 10 kg N2O-23\nN ha\u22121 y\u22121.24\nOur results also suggested that annual N2O emissions were not strictly proportional to fertiliser25\n22\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nN rate, which is in agreement with the results of Barton et al. (2008). The latter showed that,1\nin a semi-arid climate, in spite of the application of N fertiliser the annual N2O emissions were2\nnot significantly increased in comparison with background emissions. They concluded that the3\nemissions of N2O from arable soils could not be directly derived from the application of N fer-4\ntiliser, and that other factors (e.g., soil properties) should be taken into account.5\nBayesian calibration provided valuable insight into the uncertainty of the simulated N2O fluxes,6\nmaking it possible to take risk into account in a range of model applications: estimation of the7\nglobal warming potential (GWP) of agro-ecosystems, assessment of cropping systems\u2019 environ-8\nmental balance, or decision support in agriculture. It would also be interesting to compare the9\nability of various agro-ecosystem models to predict N2O emissions on the same data sets, in a10\nsimilar fashion as Frolking et al. (1998) and Li et al. (2005). Furthermore, Bayesian Model Com-11\nparison (Van Oijen et al., 2005; Kass and Raftery, 1995) could be applied to examine multiple12\nmodels and to quantify their relative likelihood, i.e. by determining which model is most prob-13\nable in view of the data and prior information. Finally, the outputs of several models could be14\ncombined to improve the accuracy of the prediction, as was suggested with atmospheric models15\n(Fisher et al., 2002).16\n5 Conclusion and future work17\nBayesian calibration was successfully applied to the CERES-EGC agro-ecosystem model to im-18\nprove the parameterization of its N2O emission module, thanks to a careful analysis and diag-19\nnostic of the MCMC chains of parameters generated by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The20\nparameters were calibrated either (i) against separately data sets or (ii) by using all the data sets21\nsimultaneously, to satisfy our objectives which were, respectively, to improve model simula-22\ntions at the field scale and to find universal values of parameters in order to spatially extrapolate23\nthe model. In addition, Bayesian calibration provided a means of quantifying uncertainties in24\n23\nha\nl-0\n03\n42\n82\n5,\n v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 1\n D\nec\n 2\n00\n8\nboth parameters and model outputs. Furthermore, it appears reasonable to assume that when the1\nmodel should be applied at a larger scale than the plot-scale, the parameter values resulted from2\nthe multi-dataset procedure could then be used for soil types which will have never been parame-3\nterised. In fact, the posterior parameter distributions encompass all our current observations and4\ngive us the possibility of quantifying their uncertainty.5\nA remaining obstacle to the extrapolation of the N2O module lies in the 4 local parameters that6\nshould be measured or estimated on site (He\u00b4nault et al., 2005), and that were accordingly not7\ncalibrated here. Identifying the key soil or landscape characteristics that control these parame-8\nters appears as a pre-requisite to the large-scale use of CERES-EGC.9\nBased on our results, we recommended a strategy to deal with model extrapolation and parame-10\nters\u2019 variability. Nevertheless, another option to tackle spatial variability would consist in using11\nother types of prior information (e.g. on soil properties) to infer the parameters of the N2O mod-12\nule. In future work, it would be beneficial to identify such \u201chyperparameters\u201d which may explain13\nspatial variability (Clark, 2005), and to develop a hierarchical Bayesian approach to derive their14\npdfs.15\nAcknowledgements16\nThis work was part of the NitroEurope Integrated Project (EU\u2019s Sixth Framework Programme for17\nResearch and Technological Development) which investigates the nitrogen cycle and its influence18\non the European greenhouse gas balance.
