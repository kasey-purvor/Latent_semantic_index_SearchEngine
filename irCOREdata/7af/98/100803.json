INTRODUCTION\nThe ability to control the spontaneous emission rate\n\u0001SER\u0002 of a point dipole impurity embedded in a wide variety\nof solid-state dielectrics is a key issue to be resolved. If this\ncan be achieved it opens up new possibilities for the appli-\ncation of doped dielectrics in the quantum optics field in\naddition to their existing applications.1\u20133 A rare-earth element\n\u0001REE\u0002 can be regarded as a good electric dipole photon-\nemitting source.4\u20136 The intra-4f-configurational transitions of\nREE are particularly interesting as emission at various wave-\nlengths ranging from deep ultraviolet to midinfrared can, in\nprinciple, be obtained. Tailoring SER of a REE by position-\ning it inside appropriate periodic arrays of a dielectric sur-\nrounding is possible, although fabrication of such dielectric\nmicrostructures is usually not trivial.7 In this respect, it is\nimportant to search for solid-state dielectrics doped with\nREE inside which the SER is very sensitive to changes of the\nnearest-neighboring atoms surrounding it. Control of the\nSER would then be possible in such doped dielectrics by\nway of adjusting external conditions such as temperature,\npressure, and electric field.\nDue to the shielding of the REE 4f electrons by the\nouter-lying 6s and 5d configurations, oscillator strengths of\nthe 4f-4f transitions are relatively insensitive to the local\ncoordination structure compared to the case of transition-\nmetal elements. Again, as the perturbation of the crystal field\nto the 4f electronic configuration is weak, the oscillator\nstrengths of the forced electric dipole transitions are not\nlarge; typically in the order of 10\u22126 in usual noncrystalline\na\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\nygchoi@hau.ac.kr\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 98, 023523 \u00012005\u0002\n0021-8979\/2005\/98\u00022\u0001\/023523\/6\/$22.50 \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics98, 023523-1\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

In an amorphous solid host, the SER of a 4f-4f\ntransition can be changed through modification of either the\ncrystal field at REE sites or the dielectric constant of the host\nmedium. Typically such modification arises as a consequence\nof compositional change of the host. As a result the extent of\nthe structural modification, and especially the dielectric con-\nstant, is usually assumed to be proportional to the size of the\nconstituent change. This reasoning then requires that a sig-\nnificant compositional adjustment is necessary to observe\nany sizable change in the absorption and emission properties\nof REE. Some 4f-4f transitions, however, exhibit excep-\ntional sensitivity towards local structural changes around the\nREE and are labeled hypersensitive.8,9 Among the 4f con-\nfigurations of Dy3+, the 6H15\/2\u2194 6F11\/2 transition satisfies the\nselection rules for the hypersensitive transition that are \u0005\u0001J\u0005\n\u00022, \u0005\u0001L\u0005\u00022, and \u0001S=0 for two 2S+1LJ manifolds, while the\n6H15\/2\u2194 6H9\/2 transition does not. This is significant as the\n6H9\/2 and\n6F11\/2 levels are of similar energy and usually con-\nsidered together and thus denoted as the \u00016H9\/2 ,\n6F11\/2\u0002 level.\nThe hypersensitive nature of the Dy3+: 6H15\/2\u2194 6F11\/2 transi-\ntion was first observed experimentally from Dy3+ ions im-\nmersed in some liquids.10 Since then reports of the hypersen-\nsitive nature of this transition have been infrequent.11 In the\ncase of noncrystalline inorganic solid hosts reported changes\nof the spectroscopic properties due to local structural modi-\nfication around the REE have been modest, even for the hy-\npersensitive transitions.12\nMultiphonon relaxation rate \u0001MPR\u0002 should also be con-\nsidered in addition to the hypersensitive nature of the\n6H15\/2\u2194 6F11\/2 transition. The MPR is dominant in determin-\ning the measured lifetime of the \u00016H9\/2 ,\n6F11\/2\u0002 level in an\nordinary sulfur-based chalcogenide glass due to the presence\nof the small energy gap between the \u00016H9\/2 ,\n6F11\/2\u0002 and the\nnext lower-lying 6H11\/2 levels \u0001see inset of Fig. 1\u0002. Such\nstrong MPR has been the major problem associated with\npracticality of the 1.3-\u0003m emission of Dy3+, despite possess-\ning some superior characteristics to the 1G4\u2192 3H5 transition\nof Pr3+ which is utilized in commercial fluoride optical fiber\ndevices.13 The measured lifetime of the 1.3-\u0003m emission in\nsome representative sulfide glasses is only \u000635 \u0003s indicat-\ning the quantum efficiency is quite low.14,15 To reduce the\nMPR low-phonon-energy hosts are often considered. How-\never, in general it is observed that the thermal and mechani-\ncal stabilities of a host medium get worse as the phonon\nenergy of the host is lowered. It has been shown that addition\nof at least 10 mol % of CsBr can be successful in increasing\nthe lifetime of the Dy3+:1.3-\u0003m emission in a Ge\u2013Ga\u2013S\nbased glass.16 Unfortunately, such significant modification on\nthe host composition tends to deteriorate the thermal and\nmechanical properties. As such we postulate that such a con-\nstituent modification \u0001a few mol %\u0002 alters the parent glass\nstructure itself as well as the local structure of those sur-\nrounding the REE. In addition to such structural changes we\nshould also take into consideration the resulting localized\nchange of the dielectric constant. Such changes affect both\nthe optical density of state and the local-field correction fac-\ntor for the absorption and emission phenomena of an electric\ndipole impurity in a sensitive manner.17 Based on these con-\nsiderations, in this work, we aimed at tailoring only the local\nstructure in the vicinity of REE through reducing the amount\nof compositional modification down to much lower doping\nlevels. More specifically, the modification of the local struc-\ntural environment of dysprosium embedded in the well-\nknown Ge\u2013As\u2013S \u0001GAS\u0002 glasses has been made by incorpo-\nrating Ga and CsBr, which then exemplifies the significant\nrole of the chemical environment of REE in controlling its\nradiative and nonradiative processes.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nWe fabricated Dy-doped GAS glasses modified with or\nwithout Ga, Cs, and Br. All the starting materials were in\ntheir element forms apart from Cs and Br which were in their\ncompound form, CsBr. The purity of the starting materials\nwere all \u000499.999% aside from CsBr of \u000499.9% purity. A\nrocking furnace was used for the 12-h-long melting of\nbatches inside the sealed silica ampoules, which were subse-\nquently quenched in air following by annealing at a suitable\ntemperature \u0001e.g., \u0006490 K for the As-rich region samples\u0002.\nOur sample preparation procedure was the same as the con-\nventional sulfide glass fabrication.18 After annealing, the\nsamples did not undergo any further thermal treatment.\nThe glass transition temperature and the onset tempera-\nture of crystallization of the samples are all identical to each\nother within the measurement uncertainty of \u00b12 K. Trans-\nmission electron microscopy investigations suggest the ab-\nsence of any crystalline phases inside the modified materials.\nBased on these results, we assume that the compositional\nmodification carried out in this study does not bring about\nany apparent crystallization or reduce the thermal stability of\nthe glasses.\nCsBr is hygroscopic and therefore glasses containing it\nmay be vulnerable to OH\u2212 contamination.

These compositions were chosen to make a num-\nber of S atoms sufficient, stoichiometric, or deficient against\nthe GeS2\u2013As2S3 tie line composition. The GAS hosts modi-\nfied by the inclusion of small amounts of Ga and CsBr are\ndesignated hereafter as, for example, 0.5\/1.0 with each num-\nber indicating molar percentage of included Ga and CsBr,\nrespectively.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISSCUSSION\nA. Measured lifetimes\nFigure 3 shows the measured lifetimes of the 1.3-\u0003m\nemission from the \u00016H9\/2 ,\n6F11\/2\u0002\u2192 6H15\/2 transition as a\nfunction of increasing the Ga and CsBr doping concentration\nin equal amounts for the As-rich GAS glass \u0001circles\u0002. Also\nshown are the same measured lifetimes for Ge-rich but\nS-sufficient, S-exact, and S-deficient glasses \u0001square, in-\nverted triangle, and triangle\u0002 doped with 0.5-mol % Ga and\nCsBr. In the As-rich glass the fluorescence lifetime is signifi-\ncantly increased upon the introduction of Ga+CsBr. The life-\ntime of the 0.5\/0.5 sample in the As-rich host is \u0006340 \u0003s,\nwhich is more than ten times the lifetime of the unmodified\n0.0\/0.0 sample, and it further increases as long as the Ga\n\u0002CsBr condition is satisfied. The condition that Ga\u0002CsBr\nin order for the lifetime to be increased is common for all the\nhost glass compositions studied. However, the size of the\nlifetime enhancement is also clearly dependent on the host\ncomposition in addition to the respective concentration of Ga\nand CsBr with their relative ratios. The measured lifetimes of\nthe 0.5\/0.5 As-rich samples are all longer than 300 \u0003s re-\ngardless of the detailed host compositional changes. The Ge-\nrich samples, however, exhibit a different behavior, as shown\nin Figs. 3 and 4. With equal doping concentrations of Ga and\nCsBr \u0001Fig. 4\u0002 the abrupt lifetime enhancement is observed\nonly in a host where excess sulfur atoms are present; in this\ncase the lifetime is measured to be \u0006370 \u0003s. Here, it should\nbe noted that though in this case the abrupt lifetime enhance-\nment does not appear both in the S-exact and S-deficient\nseries, it does appear in these hosts when the doping condi-\ntion Ga\u0005CsBr is satisfied. For example, the lifetime of\n0.5\/1.0 Ge-rich and S-exact composition is \u0006760 \u0003s.\nB. Oscillator strengths\nMore detailed analyses have been carried out using As-\nrich host samples.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nDy-doped samples shown in Fig. 5 were calculated using\ntheir absorption cross-section spectra.19 The two closely\nspaced levels, 6H9\/2 and\n6F11\/2, are least-squares fitted with\nrespective Lorentzian line-shape functions based on the as-\nsumption that the electronic states are solely and indepen-\ndently represented by the corresponding term symbols and\ninhomogeneous broadening is moderate throughout the\nsamples. The least-squares fits with a Lorentzian profile are\nfound to be quite reproducible and a good approximation to\nthe bandwidth of the crystal-field splitting which is compa-\nrable with the energy discrepancy between the centers of\ngravity of the two levels.20,21 The overall oscillator strength\nof the 6H15\/2\u2192 \u00016H9\/2 , 6F11\/2\u0002 transition decreases with in-\ncreasing Ga\u2013CsBr concentration. While the decrease in mag-\nnitude of oscillator strength of the 6H15\/2\u2192 6H9\/2 transition is\nmoderate, that of the hypersensitive 6H15\/2\u2192 6F11\/2 transition\nabruptly decreases for Ga \u0001=CsBr\u0002 concentrations of above\n0.1 mol %. At these concentrations the \u201cnormal\u201d 6H15\/2\n\u2192 6H9\/2 transition is dominant in the overall oscillator\nstrength. In the 0.5\/0.5 sample in the As-rich series, for ex-\nample, the oscillator strength of the 6H15\/2\u2192 6F11\/2 transition\nis reduced to \u00066% of that measured in the unmodified parent\nglass. It is interesting to note that the sudden decrease of\noscillator strength of the 6H15\/2\u2192 6F11\/2 transition occurs\nwhen the concentration of CsBr exceeds ten times that of the\nDy atoms. Another series of samples with the same host\ncomposition but doped with 0.01-mol % dysprosium have\nalso exhibited this tendency. This would indicate that the\ncoordination number in the nearest-neighboring shell of Dy3+\nis between 5 and 10, which needs to be further confirmed.\nC. Emission spectra\nAs the oscillator strength of the 6H15\/2\u2194 6F11\/2 transition\nis found to be very sensitive to the concentration of Ga and\nCsBr when probed by the changes of the absorption cross-\nsection spectra, it is reasonable to expect the emission spec-\ntra to behave correspondingly. As shown in Fig. 6, the peak\nwavelength of the emission spectra blueshifts as Ga\n\u0001=CrBr\u0002 concentration increases. With this increasing con-\ncentration, the oscillator strength of the lower-energy\n6H15\/2\u2194 6F11\/2 transition reduces compared to that of the\nhigher-energy 6H15\/2\u2194 6H9\/2 transition. As a result emission\nfrom the 6H9\/2\u2192 6H15\/2 transition becomes to dominate in\nthe overall \u00016H9\/2 ,\n6F11\/2\u0002\u2192 6H15\/2 transition. As such the\npeak position of the 6H15\/2\u2194 \u00016H9\/2 , 6F11\/2\u0002 absorption and\nemission is seen to blueshift with an increasing amount of\nthe constituent modification.22 Such behavior is also ob-\nserved from the Ge-rich series of samples.\nD. Structural changes\nThe significant changes observed in the absorption and\nemission properties of the 6H15\/2\u2194 \u00016H9\/2 , 6F11\/2\u0002 transition\nin our modified glasses can have a number of origins. From\nthe viewpoint of the local structural rearrangement around\nDy3+ sites, changes in coordinating atoms, interatomic dis-\ntances, and their inversion symmetries have to be considered,\nwhile the microscopic dielectric constant and volume of the\nstructurally modified region can also have an influence. Con-\ncerning the component atoms of our samples, the existence\nof Ga and CsBr along with their relative concentrations is a\ncritical prerequisite to invoke the effects observed. In this\nregard, we have investigated structural correlation between\nGa and Br. The presence of Cs is found to play a less impor-\ntant role as we have obtained similar results when Cs is\nreplaced with K or Rb.

A more detailed ex-\nplanation on how Br ions are associated with Ga sulfide can\nbe found in a previous report.21 Formation of such com-\nplexes needs to be charge compensated, and in this case Dy3+\nwould act as a charge compensator together with Cs+. In this\nway incorporation of Dy3+ close to the Ga\u2013Br related com-\nplexes is achieved without high-temperature heat treatment\nbeing applied. Thus we presume that preferential highly\nsymmetric coordination in nearest-neighboring shell of dys-\nprosium with bromine in the Ga\u2013Br related complexes is\nmainly responsible for these reported behaviors. According\nto the previous experimental results reported for hypersensi-\ntive transitions, a decreased oscillator strength can result\nfrom enhancing the localized inversion symmetry.9 Therefore\nwe suggest that the local coordination structure around Dy3+\nshould possess enhanced site symmetry following the intro-\nduction of Ga and CsBr.\nAs previously mentioned, the lifetime enhancement ef-\nfect as a consequence of locating Dy3+ close to the Ga\u2013Br\nrelated complexes depends not only on the concentration of\nGa and CsBr but also on the host composition, though a clear\nunderstanding of the underlying mechanisms remains to be\nresolved. However, differences in the chemical bond ener-\ngies of the heteropolar Ge\u2013S and As\u2013S bonds as well as\nhomopolar Ge\u2013Ge, As\u2013As, and S\u2013S bonds along with their\nrelative ratios would result in such a dependence on the host\ncomposition.\nE. Changes of spontaneous emission rate\nA small change in the oscillator strength of the hyper-\nsensitive 6H15\/2\u2194 6F11\/2 transition gives rise to a much\ngreater change of SER for the 6F11\/2\u2192 6H15\/2 transition com-\npared to that for the normal 6H9\/2\u2192 6H15\/2 transition. In the\nframework of Judd-Ofelt theory,23,24 the line strength for\nelectric dipole transitions is proportional to the reduced ma-\ntrix elements \u0007A\bU\u0001\u0006\u0002\bB\t2 between the two electronic states\ninvolved \u0007A\u0005 and \u0005B\t, where U\u0001\u0006\u0002 is the tensor operator of\nrank \u0006=2, 4, or 6. The three values of the reduced matrix\nelements are 0.9394, 0.8299, and 0.2061, respectively, for\nthe 6F11\/2\u2192 6H15\/2 transition, and 0.0000, 0.0166, and 0.2017\nfor the 6H9\/2\u2192 6H15\/2 transition.25 The values for transitions\nfrom the 6F11\/2 state to other remaining underlying states\n\u0001Fig. 1\u0002 are also larger than the corresponding cases for the\n6H9\/2 state. As such SER of the\n6F11\/2 level is much more\nsensitive to the changes of the oscillator strengths than that\nof the 6H9\/2 transition. Thus, the decreased oscillator\nstrengths of the 6H15\/2\u2194 6F11\/2 transition, which arises as a\nconsequence of the local structural changes at the Dy3+ sites,\nresults in a significant decrease of SER of the 6F11\/2 state in\nthe modified GAS glasses. On the other hand the refractive\nindex measured at 1.3 \u0003m is found to decrease with increas-\ning concentrations of Ga and CsBr, though the corresponding\nchanges are all less than \u00060.02. Therefore the changes in the\ndielectric constant would not fully account for the observed\nSER changes, though the microscopic dielectric constant\naround the Dy3+ is not clearly known at this time.\nIt is worthwhile to note that the uncertainty of Judd-\nOfelt analysis usually becomes larger when hypersensitive\ntransitions are involved. In addition application of the\nLorentzian-type local-field correction factor, which has been\nmost widely used, may fail to account for the actual local\nfield experienced by the doped impurity dipoles inside solid\ndielectrics.26 We therefore ruled out the results of Judd-Ofelt\nanalyses on our samples. On the other hand, the Fuchtbauer-\nLadenburg equation was considered to be inadequate to cal-\nculate the intrinsic lifetime of the \u00016H9\/2\n6F11\/2\u0002 level in that\nthe 6H15\/2 and \u0001\n6H9\/2 ,\n6F11\/2\u0002 levels are not just a two-level\nsystem but there are two other energy levels between them,\nas shown in Fig. 1.\nF. Changes of multiphonon relaxation rate\nTogether with the decreased SER, the reduced MPR is\nalso responsible for the far enhanced lifetimes of the 1.3-\n\u0003m emission in our modified glasses. Population of the\n6H11\/2 level is fed from the above-lying \u0001\n6H9\/2 ,\n6F11\/2\u0002 level\nmainly through multiphonon relaxation processes. The inten-\nsity of the 1.3-\u0003m emission increases compared to the 1.7-\n\u0003m emission from the 6H11\/2\u2192 6H15\/2 transition with in-\ncreasing Ga \u0001=CsBr\u0002 concentration as shown in Fig. 1. This\nevidence clearly indicates that the decreased MPR in the\nmodified samples must be taken into consideration. The Ra-\nman spectra reveal that a molecular vibration associated with\nthe Ga\u2013Br chemical bond appears at \u0006260 cm\u22121 in the modi-\nfied samples,21,27 which is smaller than the representative\nphonon energy of these sulfide glasses, \u0006350 cm\u22121.18 In this\nregard we postulate that as we surround the Dy3+ with Br we\nare reducing the local phonon energy around the ion from\nthat of the host glass \u0001\u0006350 cm\u22121\u0002 to \u0006260 cm\u22121, and then\nthe \u0006260-cm\u22121 phonons participate in the MPR process of\nthe \u00016H9\/2 ,\n6F11\/2\u0002 level in the modified glasses.\nG. Changes of electronic band-gap energy\nBesides the reported abrupt changes of the spectroscopic\nproperties of Dy3+, the electronic absorption edge of the host\nglass itself is significantly changed as Ga and CsBr are in-\ntroduced \u0001Fig. 7\u0002. The band-gap energy of the Ge-rich\nglasses blueshifts upon the introduction of such small\namounts of Ga and CsBr, while that of the As-rich glasses\nredshifts upon the same constituent modification. Though the\nbulk thermal properties of the host glasses remain unchanged\nfollowing the introduction of small amounts of Ga and CsBr,\nit is perhaps more surprising that the band-gap energy of the\nhost glass is modified to such an extent.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn summary, we observe that it is possible to modify\nfluorescence lifetime of the \u00016H9\/2 ,\n6F11\/2\u0002 states of Dy3+ in\nnoncrystalline Ge\u2013As\u2013S alloys through the selective addition\nof low levels of Ga and CsBr. We show that the change in\nSER+MPR is more sensitive to the local coordination struc-\nture of the Dy3+ compared to other hypersensitive transitions\nthat have been observed so far in solid-state dielectric hosts.\nPreferential highly symmetric coordination in nearest-\nneighboring shell of dysprosium with bromine in\n023523-5 Choi et al.
