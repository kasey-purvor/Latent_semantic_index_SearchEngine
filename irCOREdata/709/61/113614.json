Klein\u2019s seminal\ntheory of the paranoid-schizoid position and the early defence mechanisms of\nsplitting and projective identification have been discussed in the first paper in the\nseries (Edwards, 2008). Klein\u2019s theory of early defence mechanisms is further\nconsidered, focussing on debates about idealization and primitive omnipotence.\nTheoretical ideas are then illustrated by drawing on observational material of a little\nboy whom I have called John, who was first observed in the middle of his first year of\nlife and again later, at the age of two years and three months.\nContext\nPsycho-analytic theory is rooted in the tradition of formulating and testing\ntheory by direct clinical experience.

My interest in theory has been kept alive\nby the experience of teaching on the Tavistock Psychoanalytic Observational\nStudies course, where the fresh eye of students and the exploratory method of\nteaching mean that theory is constantly under review. Theory is also kept alive\nby my work as a member of a multi-disciplinary team undertaking diagnostic\nassessments of infants, children and parents, to inform Family Law proceedings,\nwhere there has been actual or suspected serious neglect or abuse. The task of the\nchild psychotherapist is to contribute an understanding of the internal world and\nemotional experience of infants and young children, as one element in a wider\nassessment of the relationships between family members. A report to the court\nmakes recommendations about the rehabilitation of families, or the permanent\nplacement of children in alternative care, and provides guidance about the kind\nof care and any specialist treatment a child and family is likely to need.\nThis work draws on applied methods related to psychoanalytic theory and\nclinical practice: on participant-observation of infants and young children with\ntheir mother, other carers and family members, and on therapeutic assessments\nof sibling groups. Older children are also assessed by being seen individually.\nInstances when the services that exist to protect children fail highlight how\ndifficult it is to really see and understand the meaning of what is observed in\nfamilies where children are at risk of significant harm. Psychoanalytic Infant\nObservation is of vital importance in understanding non-verbal behaviour and\nprimitive states of mind in infants, and in young children whose capacity to play\nand to communicate has been severely impaired. The difficulties inherent in this\nwork have previously been well described by others (Trowell, 1999; Youell,\n2002).\nThe assessment and observational process can be very disturbing. Bringing\nobservational material and its emotional impact into contact with psychoanalytic\ntheory facilitates the transformation of primitive emotional experience into\nsomething meaningful (Bion, 1965). Psychoanalytic theory enables a regen-\nerative process, helping to sustain the capacity to go on being alive and receptive\nto painful emotional experiences, if it really speaks to what has been observed\nand emotionally felt. Inevitably, theory not only supports clinical experience, but\nis also tested by it. Under the strain of this testing, I have found that the different\naspects of observation, emotional experience and theory from time to time\nchange their relationship to one another, like the pieces in a kaleidoscope coming\napart and joining together again, so that attention shifts to bring a less\nprominent aspect of theory more sharply into focus.\nThe interplay between internal and external experience\nA linear thread can be traced connecting the theories of Freud and Klein, in terms\nof the central significance of the duality of the life and death instincts, and the\ncapacity of the ego to tolerate contact with internal and external reality. Klein\u2019s\n44 A. Fitzgerald\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n0 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nfirst young child patients communicated a vivid picture of an internal world\npermeated by persecutory anxiety. Klein took this as a confirmation of Freud\u2019s\ntheory of the operation of the death instinct (Freud, 1920; Klein, 1946). She\nthought that the infant\u2019s fear of death was first experienced as primitive terror; a\nfear of annihilation (Klein, 1946). The onslaught of extreme persecutory anxiety\nfollowing on from birth implied the existence of a rudimentary ego, active from\nthe beginning and functioning as the agent of early defence mechanisms: splitting\nof good and bad aspects of the self and of the object, projection and introjection\nof strong feelings of love and aggression, denial, idealization, and omnipotence.\nGross distortions brought about by the operation of early defence mechanisms\nmeans that the infant\u2019s experience is far removed from reality, shaped instead by\nphantasies that arise from the need to deflect the sadism and aggression of the\ndeath instinct outwards.\nMy reading of Klein brings to the foreground the significance of her\nhypothesis that the infant\u2019s first experience is one of terror and of being\noverwhelmed by persecutory anxiety. This brings into sharp relief the need for\nthe external world to provide an experience that will mitigate, rather than\nconfirm, the infant\u2019s phantasies of cruelty and persecution:\nUnpleasant experiences and the lack of enjoyable ones in the young child, especially a\nlack of happy and close contact with loved people, increase ambivalence, diminish\ntrust and hope and confirm anxieties about inner annihilation and external\npersecution; moreover they slow down and perhaps permanently check the beneficial\nprocesses through which in the long run inner security is achieved. (Klein, 1940,\np. 346\u0002347)\nAround the middle of the first year of life, if all goes well, the strength of early\nsplitting diminishes, giving way to a greater capacity for integration. This in turn\nushers in awareness that the \u2018bad object\u2019 of early experience is not separate from\nthe \u2018good object\u2019, but that both are aspects of the whole object of the mother.\nParanoid-schizoid anxieties about the survival of the self are then able to give\nway to depressive concerns related to the survival of the object. Awareness of\nthe mother as whole and separate brings about a dawning realization of\nher connection with others, particularly the father, in the oedipal constellation\n(Klein, 1946). Fresh anxieties follow on from this better contact with reality:\nconcern about the damage wrought upon the internal and external objects,\nmother, father and the parental couple, when splitting and aggression had been\nat its height. Grief about earlier attacks on the \u2018bad object\u2019, now recognized as an\naspect of the whole \u2018good\u2019 mother, inhibits aggression and gives rise to the wish\nto make reparation. The capacity to be in contact with depressive concern for the\nobject and the urge to make reparation are classically understood to be necessary\npre-requisites for the development of a capacity for symbolization, play,\nlanguage, learning, and all creative work (Klein, 1937; Segal, 1957).\nThere are at least two pathways that clearly diverge from the trajectory of\nKlein\u2019s theory of ordinary development. One comes about when innate,\nInfant Observation 45\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n0 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nconstitutional problems in the infant interfere with development. This is the\npathway that Klein chose to explore in her later clinical and theoretical work. She\ninvestigated the constitutional factors of innate, excessive envy and greed,\nderivatives of the death instinct, and the ways in which these can interfere with\nordinary maturational processes in infancy, in spite of favourable external\ncircumstances (Klein, 1957). The second pathway comes about as a consequence\nof adverse environmental experience. This was something that Klein did not\nunderestimate, but also did not fully explore. There are only two clinical examples\nin which Klein described the way in which adverse external experience can shape\nthe development of a child. Of the \u2018little criminal\u2019, referred to her for analysis due\nto his stealing and sexual attacks on little girls, she says that his environment had\nbeen one of \u2018the most desolate circumstances\u2019. Klein concluded about his\ndifficulties:\nCompared with the neurotic child, he had actually had experience of an over-\nwhelming super-ego, which the other child had only evolved from inner causes. Thus\nit was also with his hatred, which, in consequence of his real experience, (Klein\u2019s\nitalics) found expression in his destructive acts. (Klein, 1927, p. 183)\nKlein\u2019s analysis of another child, Dick, also took account of difficulties\narising from his external relationship with his mother, which Klein acknowl-\nedged as having contributed to the genesis of his internal difficulties. Klein\nargued that Dick\u2019s inhibited capacity for symbol formation was the result of\n\u2018premature ego development\u2019 arising from a too-early onset of feelings of guilt\nand concern, brought about by a lack of loving warmth in his actual relationship\nwith his mother, as well as internal factors in the child (Klein, 1930, p. 223).\nMelanie Klein and Infant Observation\nFollowing the publication of Klein\u2019s work (Klein, 1935, 1940, 1946), interest in\ndevelopmental processes in infancy began to grow. Dr Margaret Ribble undertook\nthe observation of 500 infants to learn about early psycho-biological development,\nparticularly the interplay between the development of sensory and perceptual\ncapacities and mental processes. Klein did not publicly acknowledge her interest in\nthis work, or the support that she felt it lent to her theories, until many years later:\nOutbursts of emotional reaction, not always well differentiated but obviously\nexpressing positive or negative direction are seen to involve the entire motor system.\n. . . the eyes focus well and can follow the mother about, the ears function well and can\ndifferentiate the sound she makes. Sound or sight of her produces the positive\nemotional responses formerly obtained only from contact, and consist of appropriate\nsmiling and even genuine outbursts of joy. (Ribble, 1944, quoted in Klein, 1952a,\np. 90)\nEsther Bick\u2019s clinical work with children was supervised by Klein and in 1948\nshe introduced psychoanalytic Infant Observation as part of the training of child\n46 A. Fitzgerald\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n0 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \npsychotherapists at the Tavistock Clinic. In 1950, Bick went into analysis with\nMelanie Klein. It seems likely that Bick\u2019s venture was undertaken with support\nfrom Klein:\nMany details of infants\u2019 behaviour which formerly escaped attention or remained\nenigmatic, have become more understandable and significant through our increased\nknowledge of early unconscious processes; in other words our faculty for observation\nin this particular field has been sharpened. . . . If we are to understand the young\ninfant, though, we need not only greater knowledge, but also a full sympathy with\nhim, based on our unconscious being in close sympathy with his unconscious. (Klein\n1952b, p. 94)\nThe significance of the mother-infant relationship, and in particular the\nmother\u2019s capacity for receptivity to the unconscious communications of the infant,\nhas been further explored in the work of Winnicott (1960) and Bion (1962).\nInfant Observation brings together questions about the interplay between internal\nand external experience previously polarized in the conflict between Anna Freud\nand Klein (Grosskurth, 1986, pp. 310\u0002362). The containment of this conflict\nmay have been significant in enabling Klein to explore the importance of the lived\nrelationship between mother and infant later in her career (Klein, 1952b).\nFollowing Bick\u2019s seminal contribution to psychoanalytic theory, derived from\nInfant Observation and clinical work with deprived children (Bick, 1968, 1986),\nthe potential for Infant Observation to contribute not only to training, but also to\ntheory, has gained greater recognition. The recent interest in psychoanalytic\nresearch offers an opportunity for this to be developed: \u2018Direct Infant Observation\nmight be considered a method of submitting theories of development in infancy,\ngained from clinical work with young children, to a measure of reality testing\u2019\n(Rhode, 2004, p. 283).\nLoss of the \u2018good\u2019 object in mourning and manic depressive states\nFreud identified the important function of introjection and the distinction\nbetween normal mourning and melancholia, depending on whether love or\nhatred predominate (Freud, 1917). Abraham argued that introjection with love\nis a normal process in mourning, while introjection with hatred gave rise to the\npathological state of melancholia (Abraham, 1924, p. 442). Klein extended this\ntheory, in light of her work with child patients. Klein proposed that the\nexperience of loss in early infancy precipitates depressive anxieties and promotes\ninternalization of the whole \u2018good\u2019 object of the mother, to form the core of the\nself. Klein presented different ideas about the nature of the loss that triggers the\nonset of depressive anxieties in infancy; referring at different times to the loss of\nthe breast brought on by the onset of weaning (Klein, 1936, 1940) and at other\ntimes to the loss of the \u2018ideal\u2019 object, brought on by the dawning awareness that\nthe \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 object are one and the same:\nInfant Observation 47\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n0 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nThe shaken belief in the good object disturbs most painfully the process of\nidealization, which is an essential intermediate step in mental development. With\nthe young child, the idealized mother is the safe guard against a retaliating or a dead\nmother and therefore represents security and life itself. As we know the mourner\nobtains great relief from recalling the lost person\u2019s kindness and good qualities, and\nthis is partly due to the reassurance he experiences from keeping the loved object for\nthe time being an idealized one. (Klein, 1940, p. 354)\nCentral to Klein\u2019s theory is the idea that an external loss triggers a crisis related\nto anxiety about the loss of the internal \u2018good\u2019 object as well, and that this\nexperience in infancy creates a template for anxieties and intra-psychic processes\nthat are reactivated by subsequent experiences of actual loss, throughout life.\nAnxiety about the loss of good external and internal objects in infancy, and later in\nmourning, intensifies the early defence mechanisms, which in this context, Klein\nterms \u2018manic defences\u2019:\nWithout partial and temporary denial of psychic reality, the ego cannot bear the\ndisaster by which it feels itself threatened when the depressive position is at its height.\nOmnipotence, denial and idealization . . . enable the early ego to assert itself against its\ninternal persecutors . . . the desire to control the object . . . to triumph over it may\nenter so strongly into the act of reparation . . . that the benign circle started by this act\nbecomes broken. (Klein, 1940, p. 347)\nLikierman has carefully traced the ambiguities, contradictions, and paradoxes\nin Klein\u2019s conceptualization of the \u2018good\u2019 object and the \u2018idealized\u2019 object\n(Likierman, 2001, p. 96). She notes the important distinction between\nidealization of the \u2018good\u2019 object and idealization of the \u2018bad\u2019 object. A clear\ndifferentiation between good and bad and a full appreciation of the qualities of\nthe \u2018good\u2019 object form the foundation for an outcome of healthy integration,\nrather than confusional states. Likierman suggests using the concept of an early\n\u2018ideal\u2019 object to maintain a distinction between the \u2018good\u2019 object and a highly\nidealized object, arising from more extreme, pathological splitting. These\nquestions are of crucial significance in work with children who have suffered\ndeprivation, abuse and the trauma arising from \u2018bad\u2019 experiences and actual\nlosses in infancy. In my view, these ideas are linked to questions pertaining to the\ninnate strength of the life instinct, which may imbue the \u2018good\u2019 object with ideal\nqualities, as a consequence of projection of strong loving currents, arising in the\nself, contributing to a capacity for resilience.\nRevisiting the survival function of primitive omnipotence\nThe concept of omnipotence was first considered by Freud in relation to the\ncapacity of the infant to achieve temporary satisfaction by means of wish-\nfulfilling hallucination, in the absence of the breast: \u2018The infant*provided one\nincludes with it the care it receives from its mother . . . betrays its unpleasure,\n48 A. Fitzgerald\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n0 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nand it then experiences the satisfaction it has hallucinated\u2019 (Freud, 1911, p. 220).\nThe phantasy of the concrete presence of the feeding breast is thought to be a\ndefence against privation, effected by turning away from a painful experience of\nfrustration in external reality, but it is also open to a different interpretation.\nFreud initially described the pleasure principle as primary, giving way only\nsecondarily and reluctantly to the reality principle (Freud, 1911). Later, Freud\nconceptualized the theory of the pleasure principle and the reality principle\ndifferently:\nThus the original \u2018\u2018reality ego\u2019\u2019, which distinguished internal and external by means of\na sound objective criterion, changes into a purified \u2018\u2018pleasure-ego\u2019\u2019, which places the\ncharacteristic of pleasure above all others. (Freud, 1915, p. 136, in Cohen, 2007,\np. 187)\nFreud\u2019s theory of \u2018auto-erotic\u2019 satisfaction can therefore be conceptualized as\nbeing derived from the earliest experience of gratification at the mother\u2019s breast.\nFerenczi (1913) suggested that the infant\u2019s first reality is the experience of the\nintra-uterine state, providing the foundation in an earlier reality, for the later\nmental state of omnipotence in infancy:\nIf therefore the human being possesses a mental life when in the womb, although only\nan unconscious one*and it would be foolish to believe that the mind begins to\nfunction only at the moment of birth*he must get from his existence the impression\nthat he is in fact omnipotent. . . . The curious thing is that*pre-supposing normal\ncare*this hallucination is in fact realized. (p. 219; p. 222)\nPrimitive omnipotence can therefore be understood not solely as a defence\nagainst reality, but as something closer to a precursor of a memory, or a thought,\nabout an earlier good experience, based on hope and an emergent capacity to\nknow about the availability of the mother. Considered in this way, the infant\nmay be turning towards a benign experience of a remembered reality, and away\nfrom the impingement of a persecutory phantasy.\nAlthough Klein initially described omnipotence operating in two distinct\nways, destructive and reparative, she seemed to come down in favour of the view\nthat omnipotence was closely bound up with the destructive tendencies. The\ndebate about the positive and negative aspects and interpretations of the defence\nof primitive omnipotence has continued to be stimulated by clinical work with\ndeprived children. Symington has drawn attention to omnipotence functioning\nas a defence against experiences of significant failure in the external environment,\nlinked to Bick\u2019s concept of \u2018second skin\u2019 defences (Bick, 1968; Symington,\n1985). Symington emphasised important distinctions in the states of mind that\nunderlie omnipotence:\nJames Bond is invincible. He is assailed by so many and such terrible things and he\nmust deal with it all by himself, and see that he is cleverer than the enemy. This boy\nhas to be James Bond. He can\u2019t rely on anybody; nobody is there to help him, so he\nInfant Observation 49\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n0 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nmust do it himself. It\u2019s not the aspect of James Bond that says \u2018\u2018I am the greatest, I am\nthe best\u2019\u2019. That is not the issue, the issue here is: I must be so clever, I must think and\nthink in order to protect myself. (Bick quoted in Symington, 1985, p. 484)\nThe published literature of work with children who have suffered deprivation\nand trauma in infancy, by child psychotherapists, draws mainly on work with the\nclinical population in treatment. It is therefore not surprising that what is\ndescribed is often concerned with the failure of early splitting, confusional states,\nidealization of and identification with the \u2018bad\u2019 object and perverse pleasure in\nthe excitement of violence, hatred and aggression (Boston & Szur, 1983;\nEmanuel, 1984, 1996). The \u2018double deprivation\u2019 of the \u2018brick wall quality\u2019 of\none child\u2019s defences is revelatory in conveying why it is that such children are so\nhard to reach, when appropriate care is made available (Boston & Szur, 1983, p.\n3). Another boy, Gary, presents very differently, telling the therapist \u2018I should\nlike to build you a fort\u2019, while advising him that it was \u2018not a safe fort\u2019. The\nsoldiers in the fort were broken, but fortunately Gary has a knight that was\nmagically able to bring the soldiers back to life. Now Gary thought that \u2018the\ndangers came from outside, the fort is safe\u2019 (idem, pp. 121\u0002122). Describing\nGary, the therapist shows that he was a boy who understood \u2018what is precious\nand has to be protected\u2019, and that while his inner world was one \u2018peopled by\ndead and injured objects\u2019, he showed hope that there could be an \u2018idealized social\nworker\/knight\u2019 who would strengthen and keep safe his shaky foster-care\nplacement (idem, pp. 121\u0002123).\nGary had been placed in care at birth, returned to his mother at eight\nmonths, and then returned to care eight months later. He had three further\nchanges of carer by the time he was three and a half years old. Placement\nbreakdown was caused by Gary\u2019s negativistic, sulky response towards his\nsubsequent carers (Boston & Szur, 1983, p. 119). This seems to link with the\nconcept of \u2018primary disappointment\u2019, (Emanuel, 1984, p. 71) in which there is a\nfailure in the parental object and the environment to meet the innate\nexpectations of the infant. One outcome in these circumstances is that\nomnipotence is resorted to as a massive defence against dependency and contact\nwith any feelings of vulnerability. This had not been the outcome in Gary\u2019s case,\nwhich raises questions about the nature of the resilience seen in children like\nGary, and the need for the therapist to be well attuned to different kinds of\nomnipotence.\nAlvarez (1992) has stressed the \u2018Kleinian distinction between processes which\nare defensive against pain and depression and those which are designed to\novercome it and foster growth\u2019 (p.166). She brings to the foreground the need for\nthe deprived child first to have an experience of secure possession of an object,\nbefore managing experiences of loss. Alvarez draws attention to positive aspects of\nomnipotence: power and potency and the infant\u2019s sense of agency. Like Alvarez,\nEdwards (2005) considers the significance not only of absence and loss but also of\npresence and gain in work with very deprived children. She adds: \u2018This involves\n50 A. Fitzgerald\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n0 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nacknowledging deficits not only, and often not principally, in the subject, but in\nthe environment and the external objects\u2019 (p. 324).\nThese considerations seem closer to Klein\u2019s thinking at the start of her career\nwhen, under the influence of Ferenczi, she wrote:\n. . . the way in which the omnipotence feeling is strengthened or destroyed by the\nchild\u2019s first serious affection determines his development as an optimist or pessimist,\nand also the alertness and enterprise, or the unduly hampering scepticism of his\nmentality. For the result of development to be not boundless utopianism and\nphantasy, but optimism, a timely correction must be administered by thought. (Klein,\n1921, p. 24)\nJohn\nJohn had been born a healthy baby at full term. He first came to the attention of\nthe authorities when he was three weeks old and the health visitor reported\nconcerns that he was \u2018failing to thrive\u2019. Two weeks later the police were called to\nthe house by a neighbour. John was found naked in his father\u2019s arms and covered\nin blood. The couple had been fighting and John\u2019s mother had bitten his father.\nJohn was placed on an emergency protection order with a short-term carer, and\nhe was then moved to a longer term placement with a foster care couple. John\nwas five months old when we were asked to undertake an assessment to advise\nthe court on the question of whether John could be safely returned to live with\nhis mother, or whether he needed to be freed for adoption.\nJohn\u2019s mother, Ms. Robinson, was brought up in circumstances of inter-\ngenerational neglect and separated from John\u2019s father who was not included in\nthe assessment. John was Ms. Robinson\u2019s second child. Her first child had been\nremoved from her care at the age of three months following a life threatening\nnon-accidental injury. It was not clear whether it had been Ms. Robinson or her\npartner at the time that had harmed the baby. Ms. Robinson had been assessed as\nhaving learning difficulties and poor impulse control. John had not been placed\non the child protection register pre-birth, as assessments during the pregnancy\nhad concluded that Ms. Robinson appeared to be more mature and stable than\nat the time of the birth of her first child.\nHome visit to the foster carers\nA visit to observe the infant in the company of the primary carer at home is\nusually undertaken before meeting the child and family in the assessment centre\nsetting.\nJohn was asleep in his cot upstairs when I arrived. The foster carer spoke vividly about\nher memories of John\u2019s first days in the placement. She described how disturbed she\nhad felt when John had made loud persistent screeching noises for the most part of two\nwhole days and nights. She recalled longing for him to be able to cry. He was not\nInfant Observation 51\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n0 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \ncomforted by being held by her, yet he became more distressed if she tried to put him\ndown. He tensed his body, holding himself rigidly, while clinging to her \u2018like a\nmonkey\u2019. She had wondered what kind of experiences could have so profoundly\naffected him, and had the sad thought that John would never be like an ordinary baby.\nShe went on to speak about her surprise when, after two days, John\nappeared to make an astonishing recovery. He stopped screeching quite\nsuddenly and soon had been able to settle to feed from a bottle. He had\ncontinued to feed well and at the time of the assessment, he had taken to the\nintroduction of some solid food with gusto. He had thrived and had made a\ngood recovery from the fragile physical state that had first alarmed the health\nvisitor. John was now able to sit with some support on a rug and amuse\nhimself with toys for short periods of time. The foster carer said that John\nliked to play with her husband, but would not accept a feed from anyone but\nher. He had begun to cry in an ordinary way.\nJohn attended supervised contact with his mother in a family centre three\ndays a week, for three hours a day. At first he had returned from these visits\nin a very distressed state, screeching once more and needing to be held for\na couple of hours before he could settle. He had gradually become less\ndistressed and easier to settle following contact. Bottles of milk and nappies\nprovided by the carer for use during contact regularly came back unused, so\nthat John returned from contact \u2018desperate\u2019 for a feed. The carer noticed that it\nwas time for John to wake up from his nap and explained that he was\npredictable in his routine. I accompanied her to John\u2019s room when she went to\npick him up:\nJohn was crouching on all fours in his cot when we entered the room. He arched his\nhead and turned towards the sound of his carer\u2019s voice as she murmured a gentle\ngreeting to him. He smiled and rocked his body back and forth excitedly, as if about to\nlaunch himself into her arms. His eyes widened as she lifted him and held him briefly\nsuspended face to face in front of her. He looked deep into her eyes and beamed at her,\nkicking his feet in gentle rotation against her belly, while patting her shoulders and\nupper chest with the flat of his palms. When the carer held him close to her, he placed\nhis arm firmly around her neck, with his right hand anchored on her shoulder,\ncontinuing to pat her upper body with the flat of the palm of his left hand. He did not\nappear to register my presence, although the foster carer spoke to me and I stood close\nby, within his line of vision. She explained that he insisted on being held after a nap\nand that he would complain loudly if she tried to put him down too soon, and she\nlaughed. Physically he was a very appealing blond-haired blue-eyed baby, with soft\ncherubic cheeks flushed pink by warmth while he slept. John continued to gaze wide-\neyed into her face as she spoke to me, smiling more broadly in response to her chiding\nlaughter. His glance then turned to me and he became suddenly subdued, a frown\nclouding his face. I felt like an unwelcome intruder in an exclusive loving relationship.\n52 A. Fitzgerald\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n0 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nComment\nJohn\u2019s first response to being with the foster carer was extreme. He was in the\ngrip of a terrifying experience and unable to gain relief by crying. The\ndescription of John screeching and his way of clinging and holding himself\nrigidly suggested that John had been able to marshal the extreme defences\nneeded to protect the immature ego from disintegration in the face of\ncatastrophic anxiety. Screeching had enabled John to project his experience of\nterror powerfully into his carer. The carer had the capacity not only to hold\nJohn physically, but also to receive and contain powerful primitive projections\n(Bion, 1962). The foster-carer\u2019s concern about the damage John had suffered\nsuggested that she felt the kind of anxieties that beset the mother of a newborn\nwho has special care needs. John seemed to have a strong capacity to benefit\nfrom the experience of being held and of being contained. His capacity to\ndefend himself against disintegration and to make use of mechanisms of\nprojection suggested that John was a baby with innate strengths, providing him\nwith the foundation for healthy resilience.\nMy initial impression was a sense of a warm relationship between John\nand his carer. Their delight was palpable. This together with my feelings of\nexclusion strongly suggested the dyadic closeness and mutual idealisation often\nobserved in the early bonding between mother and infant. John seemed\nconfident that he had the power to summon his carer to him at the moment of\nwaking and wanting her, but without needing to cry out. He also appeared to\ndelight in the sense that he had the power to make his carer hold him, and in the\nexperience of being held by her. The foster carer\u2019s anticipation of the moment\nwhen John would wake up meant that John\u2019s sense of early omnipotence was\nconfirmed by his carer\u2019s responsiveness in external reality. Omnipotence and the\napparent confirmation of this by external reality provided John with a kind of\nprotective shield against the pain of privation and helplessness.\nObservations at the assessment centre\nChildren and families are typically seen at the assessment centre for one short day\neach week, for three to five weeks. Sessions take place in the clinical setting of a\nconsulting room, the structured setting of a playroom, and in an informal family\nroom, during the mid-morning and lunch breaks. The family is seen in a variety\nof different family groupings. The assessment usually includes observation of the\ninfant\u2019s response to separation from the foster carer and from the mother, and\nthe infant\u2019s response to being left for a short while with an attentive, friendly\nstranger.\nObservation of John with his mother\nFor much of the time during the assessment Ms. Robinson fluctuated between\ndissociated states of mind and explosive angry complaints. She had difficulty in\nInfant Observation 53\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n0 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nhandling John and was not able to hold him securely, to feed him, or to change\nhim. She explained this problem in terms of her difficulties with manual\ndexterity, linked to her learning difficulties. We observed that Ms. Robinson had\nsome problems with fine motor skills, but this difficulty was noticeably more\npronounced when she was handling John. Invited to bring John into the\nconsulting room, she awkwardly tried to lift him out of the car seat, asking for\nassistance with the clips on the straps which she could not open. She held John\nwith two hands around his waist about a foot away from her body as we walked\nto the room. John appeared floppy and disorientated; his gaze averted from his\nmother as he turned his head from side to side, his eyes quickly scanning around\nthe corridor as if searching for something:\nOnce in the consulting room, mother continued to hold John awkwardly, her two hands\nclasped around his waist, holding him away from her body as if unexpectedly suspended\nin the act of putting him down, and unsure about how to do this. As he dangled in\nmid-air, John agitatedly started to kick and to wriggle against his mother\u2019s hands,\nmoving his head from side to side. I felt acutely anxious throughout that John was about\nto be dropped. In response to my suggestion that Ms. Robinson put him down on a rug,\nmother anxiously lowered him and then at the last moment dropped him rather\nabruptly, face down. John pressed the full length of his body against the rug, as if seeking\na sensation of firmness. He burrowed his face into the folds of the blanket, mouthing at\nthe fabric and then frantically started to grasp the rug between his fingers, pushing the\nfabric against his eyes and into his mouth, as if trying to block his every orifice.\nMother left the room and I sat John on the rug with some support and passed him a\nsoft toy puppy. John accepted this with a firm grip and took it to his mouth. He opened\nhis hand and dropped the toy. I returned the toy to him and he dropped it again, seeming\nanimated. He looked directly into my face with a mischievous, expectant look, as if\ngiving me the signal to retrieve the toy. He put it in his mouth and then rubbed the soft\nfabric dreamily against his face and the side and top of his head, with a far away\nexpression on his face. After a few moments, he began to whimper and looked crossly at\nthe toy. He dropped it with a forceful gesture, as if throwing it away. When I offered it\nback to him, he accepted the toy and smiled with delight, while intently holding my gaze.\nHe put the toy in his mouth and sucked his fingers . . . His eyes closed and he fell asleep,\nrather suddenly.\nComment\nAlthough John appeared physically and emotionally robust in the presence of his\nfoster-carer, our observations quickly showed that he had few internal resources\nto sustain him during her absence. The absence of the \u2018good\u2019 object in external\nreality was met with the absence of a \u2018good\u2019 object in his internal world, at a time\nwhen developmentally this would not yet have been securely established, even in\nordinary circumstances. The interactions between John and his mother were\npainful to observe as he fluctuated between gaze avoidance, actively turning away\n54 A. Fitzgerald\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n0 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nfrom her, and more extreme attempts to deny her existence; shutting down his\neyes and ears, as if seeking to obliterate all awareness of her presence. The\nabsence of the foster carer seemed to leave John in the grip of a phantasy of\nhaving been abandoned in the care of a \u2018bad\u2019 object.\nWe were concerned to observe a tendency in John to withdraw from\nexternal reality, as a result of acute anxiety arising from the twin effects of the\nabsence of his carer and the presence of his mother. We wondered whether\nJohn\u2019s development had been further adversely affected by internal splitting\nprocesses being concretely replicated in his external world. It seemed that time\nspent with his well-attuned and responsive carer, alternating with time spent\nwith a mother who was unable to hold him, or respond to his basic needs\nsuch as hunger, meant that his mother came to be experienced by him as\na terrifying persecutor. She was not able to help John to move out of a\npersecuted state by drawing him into an experience of more responsive contact\nwith her, and a more benign external reality.\nThe lively, alert state in which John was able to explore the experience of\nloss and recovery through symbolic play in his time with me conveyed\nsomething more hopeful. I wondered if my spontaneous gesture of an\ninvitation to play had called forth in John a different kind of internal object,\nas I recalled the carer\u2019s description of John playing with the male foster\ncarer. There were rapid oscillations in John\u2019s states of mind. His stroking\ngesture with the soft toy against his face, when he had managed to make some\nrecovery from a very persecuted state, suggested awareness of the absence of his\ncarer, which then seemed to propel John to turn to an omnipotent phantasy of\nthe presence of the gratifying breast. This did not sustain him for long in a real\nsituation where he had to manage the absence of his carer for some hours. The\nsudden way in which John fell asleep suggested the collapse of his fragile\ndefences, akin to a dissociated state.\nJohn with his adoptive parents\nWhen John was two years and three months old, we were asked to provide a\nfurther assessment, to comment on the concerns raised in our earlier report\nabout the fragility of John\u2019s emotional states and the areas of concern that we\nhad raised about John\u2019s long-term development. We were asked to give an\nopinion about whether we thought that John and his adoptive parents would\nneed a treatment intervention, post adoption. The assessment of John to inform\nthe adoption planning process involved an initial meeting with the adoptive\nparents and two observations of John with them at home.\nConsultation with the adoptive parents\nJohn had been able to remain with the same foster carer until he moved to live\nwith his adoptive parents, shortly following his first birthday. At the point of\nInfant Observation 55\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n0 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \ntransition from his foster carer, John was described as seeming contented. He\nhad not shown any overt signs of distress on separation from his foster carer and\nfor the first few weeks he did not cry. His adoptive mother recalled that in the\nearly stages John sometimes arched his body and pushed his head back, away\nfrom physical contact with her. John also preferred to hold his bottle himself\nwhile feeding, turning away from eye contact, sitting forward on her knee, as if\nto avoid physical proximity and the experience of being held by her. In contrast\nto his coolness towards his adoptive mother, he was said to have immediately\nstruck up a warm and playful relationship with his adoptive father.\nHis adoptive mother recalled having felt \u2018utterly controlled\u2019 by John at first.\nShe explained that John had managed to make her stick rigidly to the routine that\nhe had been accustomed to with his foster carer, powerfully resisting any changes\nthat she wanted to introduce. After a couple of months, as he became able to give\nup his rigid control and began to accept some changes, John started to make\npainful screeching noises, which the adoptive mother described as seeming to\ncome from somewhere \u2018very primitive, deep inside him\u2019. At about fifteen months,\nJohn responded to his adoptive mother leaving the room, even briefly, by crying\nin a profound and inconsolable way. John had been able to speak some words at\nthe time of his first birthday, but following the transition from the foster carer, he\nhad stopped speaking for some weeks. When he started to speak again he did not\nform his words clearly. John was now described as being a chatty little boy, but his\npronunciation was not clear and he could be hard to understand.\nSecond home visit\nJohn\u2019s adoptive mother sat on a bean bag on the floor and John climbed onto her lap,\nenthusiastically reaching out his hand to stroke her face firmly and lovingly. He then\nplayed a game of putting his finger inside his own mouth and then inside the mouth of\neach of the adults. I was told that this was to do with his present curiosity about teeth.\nHe played with a small car and a larger rescue truck. He ran the two side by side, as\nif along a road, sometimes tentatively bringing them together and then moving them\napart. He narrated a story to his adoptive parents all the while, which I could not\nunderstand, but they were able to. He continued to drive the two along, sometimes\nbringing them together in tandem, sometimes driving them apart. The little car\nsuffered an accident and he hooked it onto the rescue truck and drove the two into a\nLego building that seemed to be a creatively constructed garage. He fussed about the\nrepair of the little car, as if in the shoes of a daddy. Once repair had been satisfactorily\nexecuted he was torn about taking the little car outside again and decided that the little\ncar should stay for now inside the garage, in order to stay safe.\nComment\nJohn conveyed delight in the experience of closeness and in being able to explore\nthe body of his adoptive mother, bringing to mind the experience of an infant at\n56 A. Fitzgerald\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n0 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nthe breast. The description of his early months with his adoptive parents\nsuggested that for a time, John\u2019s response had been one of denial of the loss of\nhis foster carer. The control that John exerted over his adoptive mother seemed\nto annihilate the experience of loss, so that the unique qualities of the external\ngood object of his adoptive mother were for a time obliterated, as he made her\ninto a replica of his foster carer. Repeated good experiences provided by his\nadoptive parents seemed to enable John to turn slowly towards dependency on\nhis new carers.\nAs the strength of John\u2019s omnipotence declined and dependency came to the\nfore, crying in response to his adoptive mother\u2019s brief absences seemed to suggest\nthe onset of painful mourning. Earlier un-mourned significant losses, both\ninternal and external, seemed to be re-activated by the ordinary comings\nand goings of his adoptive mother. John\u2019s relationship to his adoptive carers\nconveyed an impression of being imbued with idealization, like his previous way\nof relating to his foster-carer. I also wondered if John\u2019s keen curiosity and\nenthusiastic exploration of the insides of mouths and his particular interest in\nteeth signified some tentative interest in knowing more about the reality of the\n\u2018bad\u2019, aggressive, aspects of himself and his objects.\nJohn showed a capacity for symbolic play in the observations at home. This\nafforded him further opportunities to explore and to work through the trauma of\nhis early experience. The play in which the broken down little car was taken to a\nplace of safety by the solid rescue truck was particularly poignant. In this play,\nthe small car seemed to represent John\u2019s sense of himself as a vulnerable damaged\nobject, rescued by a strong reliable object seeming to represent the father, and\ntaken to a place of safety with the good qualities of the mother. This play\nconveyed residues of idealization, omnipotence and wish fulfilment, along-\nside themes of realistic dependency and the optimism of hope. John\u2019s play\ndemonstrated a capacity to create a narrative in which three objects stood in\nloving relation to one another, with damage and the need for repair acknowl-\nedged.\nThis seemed to me to contain almost all of the aspects to be found in Klein\u2019s\ndescription of the constellation of the depressive position, with one significant\ndifference. The picture of the internal catastrophe externalized in John\u2019s play was\nthat of a damaged baby with whom he appeared strongly identified. Reparation\nseemed to be the work required by the parents, individually and together, who\nseemed able to carry out the necessary repairs in the play sequence in a realistic,\nrather than a manic way. There was sense that John had gone some way to\nsecuring in his internal world a mother, a father and a parental couple with the\nmeans to perform the task of rescue, repair, revival, and protection of the small\ndamaged object.\nEdwards\u2019s work with deprived children led her to question the classical theory\nthat symbolisation and the capacity for creativity necessarily follow on from the\nfull encounter with depressive anxieties. She says:\nInfant Observation 57\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n0 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \n. . . ego capacities can be developed towards the integration of a sufficiently good\nobject to feel for. This might be thought of as an opportunity to be able to repair the\nself to some extent, though in a predominantly paranoid schizoid mode, before\nreparation of damaged objects can be contemplated . . . . Perhaps one might think of\nthis as a kind of paranoid-schizoid creativity, responsible for splitting and protecting\nthe very core of the self. (Edwards, 2005, p. 333)\nThis idea seems linked to a later shift in Klein\u2019s theory when she suggested\nthat even when paranoid schizoid defences predominate, the young infant is\ncapable of some transitory experiences of integration in relation to early\npart-objects (Klein, 1952a). In a situation of early trauma, where the infant has\nsuffered significant actual losses in external reality, as in John\u2019s case, early\ninternalization is additionally complicated by the introjection of a lost object in\nexternal reality, precipitating a process of mourning. Reparative urges may need\nfirst to be directed towards the self, in order to repair an internalized damaged,\ndying or dead object, experienced as part of the core of the self. This is linked to,\nbut qualitatively different from, Freud\u2019s description of melancholia and the\n\u2018shadow of the object, falling upon the ego\u2019 (Freud, 1917, p. 249).\nDiscussion\nIn the early weeks of John\u2019s life his mother had been unable to care for him\nadequately and his experience seemed to have been one of extreme privation and\npain. The combination of paranoid-schizoid anxieties in the internal world, with\nexperiences of privation and pain in the external world, meant that internal\nanxiety states were traumatically confirmed rather than mitigated by external\nreality. Early trauma was subsequently compounded by multiple experiences of\nloss in the first weeks of life, and then again at the time of John\u2019s first birthday.\nI observed John on four occasions in early infancy and then twice when he\nwas a young child. I was given a great deal of information about him from the\nreports of social workers and others who had been involved during the two years\nwhen he was in care. I also had the opportunity to learn about him from\ndiscussions with his foster-carer and his adoptive parents. The papers provided to\ninform the assessment of Looked After Children are often extensive, yet the\ncontent and the themes described are similar and frequently slight; reporting as\nthey do a bleak story of the fairly limited number of ways in which family life\nbreaks down. Time and again similar tragic stories and facts underpin the reason\nfor a referral to a specialist child protection assessment service. Although broad\nthemes emerge, I am always struck by the uniqueness of the individual infants\nand young children whom I meet.\nThe defence mechanisms of idealization and primitive omnipotence seemed\nto have enabled John to keep in store some seeds of hope, until more favourable\ncircumstances could be securely established. Optimism came to life once more,\nfollowing a period that suggested a state of painful mourning, allowing John to\nenter into a dependent, creative relationship with the gradually discovered and\n58 A. Fitzgerald\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n0 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \ntrusted new good objects in his external world. John was able to take in the love\nand care provided by his adoptive parents to help him to re-build his previously\nshattered inner world.\nTrauma may give rise to severe withdrawal and dissociated states, or to the\nimpoverishment of the personality that occurs when an infant relies too often\nand for too long on \u2018second-skin\u2019 defences. More often there is an interplay, with\nfluctuation to varying degrees between the different defences that the infant has\nat his disposal, to afford protection against adverse external experiences. Infants\nlike John show signs of an impressive capacity to find a way through to a path of\nhealthier development.\nI have argued that constitutional strength in the infant can be understood in\nterms of the innate strength of the life instinct within, affording a core of resilience\nfor some infants who experience early trauma. The strength of primitive defences\nmay for a time provide a protective factor against the impact of adverse\ncircumstances. Provision of timely protection and reparative experiences in the\nexternal world can then facilitate a significant recovery from early trauma. Infant\nObservation and Klein\u2019s rich theoretical template can combine in the work of a\nwell supported multi-disciplinary team that provides the necessary thinking space\nto process primitive emotional experiences. In these circumstances, assessment of\ninfants and young children at risk can make something of the depth, nature,\nand complexity of their individual stories even in a relatively brief intervention.\nA multi-dimensional assessment of infants and young children who have\nexperienced abuse and trauma can inform planning processes to minimize the\nrisk of further harm to the child, caused by over-optimistic attempts at\nrehabilitation of children with families who will be unable to support the\nadditional special need of the child, arising from earlier trauma. An assessment\ninformed by Infant Observation and psychoanalytic theory can help to realistically\ninform placement planning to support infants and young children in their\nrecovery from early trauma, optimizing their life chances.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank Lynne Amidon, Dr. Mike Shaw and the team at the\nMonroe Family Assessment Service; also Jenifer Wakelyn for encouragement to\nwrite this paper, and Margaret Rustin, for helpful comments on an earlier draft.\nI am grateful for the inspirational teaching that first captivated me, and for this I\nwould like to thank William Halton, Judith Edwards and Maggie Cohen.\nReferences\nAbraham, K.
