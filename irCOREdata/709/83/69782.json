INTRODUCTION \nIn the past few years, there has been widespread \nconcern over the possibility of climate change arising \nfrom the observed increase in the atmospheric concen- \ntrations of the greenhouse gases, particularly carbon \ndioxide. This has stimulated a growing body of \nresearch on the global carbon cycle; and many com- \nputer-based mathematical models have been con- \nstructed in an  attempt to explain the dynamics of \nglobal carbon balance and,  in particular, to assess the \neffects of projected fossil fuel usage and land-use \nchanges into the next millennium. Paradoxically, while \nthe inherent uncertainty in such analysis is often \nacknowledged, most of these models have been com- \n'Present address: Centre for Environmental Strategy, Uni- \nversity of Surrey, Guildford GU2 5XH, United k n g d o m  \n\"E-mall: p.young@lancaster.ac.uk \npletely deterministic in nature, usually with a fairly \nlarge and complex nonlinear structure characterised \nby a relatively large number of unknown parameters. \nConventionally, a deterministic, physically-based \nmathematical model of t h s  type is based on the currently \naccepted theoretical paradigms in the field of clunate sci- \nence; and the parameters in the model, which normally \nhave a perceived physical interpretation, are  either \nestimated directly from laboratory or point source data; \nobtained by optimisation, so that the model matches the \nobserved time series data to some acceptable degree; or \ndetermined by a combination of these methods. In this \ncontext, model optirnisation may be formal (e.g. Enting & \nLassey 1993) or based on some less objective 'calibration' \nprocedure which involves 'tuning' the parameters within \nphysically justifiable bounds until a reasonable match to \nthe observed data is obtained. \nClearly, the less formal approaches leave much to \nsubjective judgement and are  difficult to fully justify in \nO Inter-Research 1998 \n158 Clim Res 9: \nstatistical terms; while the formal optimisation meth- \nods normally encounter difficulties because of the \ninherent model complexity. In particular, as pointed \nout above, the models tend to contain a relatively large \nnumber of parameters, usually more than can be esti- \nmated unambiguously from the limited observational \ntime series. Typically, this 'over-parameterisation' has \ndeleterious effects: the model can be fitted to the data \nbut the associated statistics reveal that many of the \nparameter estimates are highly correlated and so sta- \ntistically ill-defined. As a result, it is often necessary to \nmodify the optimisation procedure in some manner: for \nexample, by constraining certain 'well known' para- \nmeters to assumed known values and only optimising a \nsubset of parameters, the estimates of which are then \nmuch better defined. This 'constrained optimisation' \napproach has been used, for example, to estimate \nparameters in the modified box-diffusion model of Ent- \ning & Lassey (1993), where 21 parameters were con- \nstrained at their a prion' assumed values and the \nremaining 9 were optimised. \nConstrained optimisation is a useful, pragmatic way \nof alleviating the statistical problems of large model \nparameter estimation but its limitations are obvious. \nThe alternative approach is to reduce the size and \ncomplexity of the model to better match the informa- \ntion content of the data. Not surprisingly, however, this \nis often frowned upon by global climate modellers, \nsince they believe the resulting reduced-order model \nthen provides an inadequate representation of the \nphysical system, which they perceive to be inherently \nmore complex. \nThere seems to be no complete solution to this mod- \nelling dilemma and so the pragmatic approaches to \nmodel building used by climate modellers seem rea- \nsonably justified. In effect, they seek to achieve an \nacceptable compromise between the scientific credi- \nbility of the model and its justification in statistical \nterms. But, whatever the model size and the method \nused to calibrate the model, the parameters I-emain \nuncertain because of the basic stochastic nature of the \nglobal carbon cycle system. There will always be some \nd.ebate about the most appropriate form of the model. \nMoreover, since i.t is impossible to conduct carefully \nplanned experiments at the global scale, the observa- \ntional and laboratory data will never be sufficient to \ndetermine the appropriate global scale parameter val- \nues with any high degree of precision. In addition, the \nmodel inputs are rarely known exactly and it seems \nreasonable that they should also be considered in sto- \nchastic terms. \nAttempts to quantify the effects of these kinds of un- \ncertainty in global carbon cycle models have been \nmade (e.g. Enting & Pearman 1987, Wigley & Raper \n1992, Enting & Lassey 1993, Schimel et al. 1995) but, so \nfar, it would appear that the consequences of uncer- \ntainty have been evaluated, almost entirely, by fairly \nrudimentary methods of deterministic sensitivity \nanalysis. In particular, there appears to have been little \nresearch on the effect that stochastic influences, such as \nthose arising from uncertain inputs and model parame- \nters, might have on the model outputs and predictions. \nTwo exceptions are the work of Gardner & Trabalka \n(1985), who used Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) to in- \nvestigate such stochastic effects in the Oak Ridge Na- \ntional Laboratory's World Carbon Cycle Model; and \nDowlatabadi & Kandlikar (1995), who used it in relation \nto the ICAM-2 integrated assessment model, which in- \ncorporates a simple global carbon cycle model. \nIn this paper, we follow the example of Gardner Pc \nTrabalka but use a rather different approach to MCS \nanalysis that has been developed previously within the \ncontext of environmental water quality studies (see \ne.g. Young 1983). In this approach, MCS and the asso- \nciated method of stochastic Generalised Sensitivity \nAnalysis (GSA) involve repeated solution of the simu- \nlation model, each time randomly selecting any uncer- \ntain parameters or input time series in line with their \nassumed levels of uncertainty, as defined by specified \nprobability distribution functions (pdf's). MCS analysis \nof this general kind has been used quite successfully in \nmany disciplines, including control and systems engi- \nneering (e.g. Spear 1970), macroeconomics (e.g.  \nYoung et al. 1973), hydrology (e.g. Whitehead & Young \n1979, Spear & Hornberger 1980, Young 1983) and ecol- \nogy (Scavia 1993). Provided a suitably powerful com- \nputing facility is available, the analysis can be used in \nthe study of reasonably large sets of nonlinear differ- \nential equations whose stochastic-dynamic behaviour \ncannot be studied analytically. For instance, the results \nreported in the present paper have been obtained \nusing a powerful parallel computer in order to signifi- \ncantly reduce the total computation time required for \nthe MCS analysis. \nThe MCS and GSA methodology used here is also \nconsidered in a companion paper (Young et al. 1996), \nwhich concentrates on methodological issues and dis- \ncusses this analysis as part of a broader approach to \nmodel building and assessment which aims to inte- \ngrate the construction of physically-based and data- \nbased (or statistical) mathematical models into a more \nrigorous, unified Data-Based Mechanistic (DBM) mod- \nelling framework (see later). Through the use of this \nDBM modelling approach, it is believed that the over- \nall modelling process will be enhanced and that the \nassumptions built into the physically-based model will \nbe more systematically and rigorously evaluated. In \nother words, the main intention of the MCS analysis, \nand the other techniques for model evaluation dis- \ncussed by Young et al. (1996), is not to criticise the \nParkinson & Young: Uncertainty and sensitivity in carbon cycle modelling 159 \nmodel under investigation as a means of representing \nthe actual global carbon cycle dynamics, but rather to \nprovide an additional means of evaluating the model in \nthis role. \nMore specifically, and within this wider context, the \nMCS\/GSA analysis is intended: \n(1) to show how the assumed uncertainly in the para- \nmeters and inputs propagates through the model and \naffects the model responses; \n(2) to indicate which parameters are most significant \nin affecting these model responses and hence direct \nfuture research into reducing the uncertainties in these \nparameters; \n(3) on the basis of (2) and associated 'stochastic opti- \nmisation' studies, to suggest the subset of parameters \nwhich are likely to be of most importance in subse- \nquent statistical model optimisation studies; and \nfinally, \n(4) to determine to what extent any nonlineanties in \nthe model are being activated and so evaluated in the \nsimulation analysis. \nOf course, these factors are only being considered \nover the range of responses represented by the MCS \nensemble and it is important that this is taken into \naccount when considering the results in relation to any \nparticular use of the model. However, the nature of the \nensemble is, to a large extent, under the control of the \nanalyst and it will normally include model responses \nover both the historical past, where observational data \nare available, as well as future periods of interest in \nglobal climate change studies, where the model is \nbeing utilised in a purely predictive manner. Thus, for \nexample, if the analyst restricts the ensemble to the \nhistorical period, then the results obtained under (4), \nabove, will reveal to what extent the nonlinearity \nassumed in the model is being evaluated in relation to \nthe observational data (for example in any model opti- \nmisation studies based on these same data). If it is not \nbeing activated at all, then great care must be taken \nwhen using the optimised model in a predictive mode, \nsince the unvalidated nonlinearity may become active \nand so seriously affect the predicted responses. \nIn the present paper, the MCS and GSA aspects of \nthis overall modelling procedure are applied to a well \nknown global carbon cycle model: namely, one of the \nlatest versions' of the modified box-diffusion model \ndescribed by Enting & Lassey (1993; hereinafter \nreferred to as the EL model). The original form of this \nmodel, developed by Oeschger et  al. (1975) is well \nestablished in its potential ability to model the move- \nment of carbon throughout the environment on time \nscales from years to centuries. The modifications made \nby Enting and Lassey have sought to build on this and \nimprove the model's agreement with observations. Pri- \nmarily, the methodology proposed in this paper and \napplied to the EL model is intended to precede the \nmodel optimisation or 'calibration' phase in the model \ndevelopment, although a similarly motivated approach \ncan be utilised later to evaluate further the predictive \nability of the optimised model. \nThe paper is divided into 7 sections: Section 2 \ndescribes the main details of the EL model, whilst Sec- \ntion 3 details how MCS, GSA and other stochastic \ntechniques are applied to the model. Section 4 dis- \ncusses an important aspect of the MCS analysis; \nnamely the selection of the a prior1 pdf's associated \nwith the model parameters. Finally, Section 5 presents \nthe results of the analysis; Section 6 highlights the lim- \nitations of the study; and Section 7 concludes with a \ngeneral discussion on the issues raised in the paper, \nincluding consideration of the results in the context of \nanthropogenic climate change. \nIt should be noted that, in addition to the MCS\/GSA \nanalysis considered here, the model evaluation frame- \nwork of Young et al. (1996) uses 2 other, associated \nn~ethodological tools to evaluate the EL model and the \nglobal carbon cycle. The first of these, Dominant Mode \nAnalysis (DMA), exploits new procedures for com- \nbined model order reduction and linearisation to iden- \ntify the small number of dominant dynamic modes that \nmost influence the dynamic behaviour of the EL model. \nWe consider this approach briefly in Section 4, where a \nreduced order version of the EL model is utilised as an \nexample to illustrate factors affecting the selection of \nthe parameter pdf's for MCS analysis. The second \nmethod constructs a model directly from observational \ntime series data, again utilising the DBM modelling \ntechniques mentioned previously (see e.g. Young & \nMinchin 1991, Young & Lees 1992, Young & Beven \n1994), to derive a minimally parameterised model \nwhich adequately explains the observational data. \nLike MCS, these additional methodological tools help \nto simplify the perceived complexity of the large simu- \nlation models and they have been used very effectively \nin our study. These results provide valuable additional \ninsight into the nature of the EL model and supplement \nthe results provided in the present paper. \n2. THE ENTING-LASSEY MODEL \nA systems block diagram of the EL modified box- \ndiffusion model of the alobal carbon cvcle is shown in \n., \nwe do not include recent modifications to the Fig. 1.

The Enting-Lassey model \n4.-- \nFossil \nthinking on the mechanisms of carbon balance in the \nglobal environment. The model attempts to explain the \nmovement of total carbon, and its 2 minor isotopes, I3C \nand 14C, throughout the global environment on time \nscales of decades to centuries. 14C is included in the \nmodel to take advantage of the atmospheric nuclear \nweapons testing in the 1950s and 60s: in effect, this \nacted as an  unplanned, global-scale tracer experiment \nand the subsequent measurements of its concentration \nchanges have been used in the calibration of global \ncarbon cycle models (Enting 1982). I3C is also used as \na tracer to help calibrate the model. \nIn the EL model, the global environment is assumed \nto be composed of 3 main compartments: the atmos- \nphere, the ocean, and the terrestrial biosphere. The \nocean and the terrestrial biosphere are assumed to \nexchange large amounts of carbon with the atmos- \nphere, but little with each other; and these exchanges \nare assumed to be in equilibrium before the start of the \nhuman industrial period (taken to be 1765; IPCC 1990). \nAfter this time, however, an input, mainly due to fossil \nfuel combustion, enters the atmosphere and is dissi- \npated throughout the system, although much remains \nin the atmosphere. A further input of \"'C 1s introduced \nas the result of the nuclear weapons testing mentioned \nabove. \nIn order to model the carbon fluxes with a reasonable \ndegree of detail, the EL model is further divided into \n23 boxes as shown in Fig. 1: the fossil fuel input is con- \nsidered to enter the troposphere, whilst the nuclear \nweapons-derived I4C enters the stratosphere. The net \nexchange coefficient. Calculation of the sur- \nface layer partial pressure is complicated by \nthe fact that much of its carbon is suspended \nin ionic form and does not contribute to this \npartial pressure. This 'buffering' action limits \nthe rate at which the ocean can take up \nanthropogenic CO2. \nThe deep ocean is modelled by 18 boxes of \nequal depth. These represent a discrete \napproximation to a l-dimensional diffusion \nprocess, which is believed to be a good rep- \nresentation of the 3-dimensional ocean circu- \nlation and is based on observations of 14C penetration \nin the ocean (Oeschger et al. 1975). Ocean diffusion is \nexpressed thus, \nwhere t is time, c is the concentration of carbon, and \nK is the vertical diffusion coefficient in the direction \ngiven by the distance parameter, z (in this case, verti- \ncally). \nEnting & Lassey have made a number of modifica- \ntions and additions to Oeschger's original model. In \nthis study, we have chosen 5 of these (which are con- \nsidered as more speculative), to evaluate by MCS\/GSA \nanalysis: \n(1) downward flux of carbon in the ocean due to \norganic detrital movement; \n(2) downward flux of carbon in the ocean due to in- \norganic (carbonate) detrital movement; \n(3) a nonlinear relation between the buffer factor and \nthe surface layer partial pressure, rather than using a \nconstant value; \n(4) a flux (based on observed data) from the old bio- \nsphere to the troposphere to account for land-use \nchanges, e.g. deforestation; \n(5) a flux from the troposphere to the old biosphere to \naccount for an uptake in carbon due to accelerated \nplant growth at higher CO2 levels, i.e. the CO2 fertili- \nsation effect. \nThus, 25 = 32 versions of the EL model, which we \ndenote E l  to E32, were considered in our study. \nParkinson & Young: Uncertainty and sensitivity in carbon cycle modelhng 161 \nMore detailed descriptions of the model in its basic \nand modified forms can be found in Enting & Lassey \n(1993) and Parkinson (1995), to which the interested \nreader is directed for further information. \n3. MONTE CARLO SIMULATION OF THE ENTING- \nLASSEY MODEL \nIn all its forms, the EL model is composed of nonlin- \near, deterministic differential and partial differential \nequations. Such a deterministic formulation can be \nconverted into stochastic form by assuming that the \nmodel parameters and inputs are uncertain and can be \ndescribed by assumed pdf's. Although these pdf's can \nbe of any form, Gaussian normal or uniform distnbu- \ntions are most often used because of their generality \nand simplicity. However, even in these simple cases, \nthe complexity of the associated Fokker-Planck equa- \ntions virtually rules out any analytical study of the \nmodel's stochastic behaviour and resort must be made \nto alternative, approximate numerical methods, such \nas stochastic MCS analysis (see e.g. Young et al. 1996). \nHere, the model is solved repeatedly (sometimes sev- \neral thousand times) over a user-specified time inter- \nval, with each simulation run (or 'stochastic realisa- \ntion') based on parameter values and inputs that are \nrandomly selected from the a prior1 assumed pdf's. In \nthis manner, a whole ensemble of model realisations is \ngenerated, which cumulatively reflect the uncertainty \nin the model response arising from the assumed uncer- \ntainty in the model parameters or inputs.' \nMCS analysis is a very flexible tool and can be used \nin a number of different ways that prove useful in the \nstudy of the EL model: \n(1) to produce sample distribution functions (histo- \ngrams) which provide an estimate of the uncertainty in \nthe model response arising from the assumed uncer- \ntainty in the model inputs and parameters (an example \nis given in Fig. 2); \n(2) to construct cumulative frequency distribution \n(cfd) curves that can be statistically compared with \nthose of the observations in order to assess how well \nthe model agrees with the measured reality in proba- \nbilistic terms; \n(3) to study the effect of modifications made to the \nmodel by statistically comparing the cfd curves associ- \n'MCS analysis can be made more efficient, in the sense of \nreducing in the requlred number of random realisations, by \nexploiting elegant devices such as Latin Hypercube Sam- \npling (see e.g. Dowlatabadi & Kandlikar 1995). However, \nwith modern fast computers, particularly parallel processing \nones such as that used in the present study, such efficiency \nsavings are not essential \nAtmospheric C@ Concentration (ppmv) \nFig. 2.

In \nthis study, methods (l), (3 ) ,  (4)  and (5) are used and \ntheir application to the EL model is outlined below. \nMethod (2) is not used due to a lack of adequate data; \nhence only a visual comparison is carried out between \nthe model response and observations (see Section 5.1). \nThe first steps in the practical application of MCS are \nto define: (a) those model state variables which are of \nprimary interest; (b) the time period over which the \nmodel is to be simulated; (c) the specific points in time, \nor a time period, over which the state variables are to \nbe studied; and (d) the initial or boundary conditions. \nIn the present evaluation of the EL model, 3 state vari- \nables are considered in detail: atmospheric CO2 con- \ncentration, p,; atmospheric 13C depletion, &l3; and \natmospheric 14C enhancement, 4 1 4 .  The model is sim- \nulated over the industrial period 1765 to 1990 and the \nstate variables are studied at  the following points in \ntime: p, at  1990; A , ' ~  at 1989; and &,l3 at 1978. The \nchoice of these dates is dictated by the availability of \nsuitable data but is otherwise of no critical importance \nto the present, rather general, investigation. Concern- \ning the initial conditions, the model is assumed to be in \nequilibrium at the start of the simulation period, with \n162 Clim Res 9: 157-1.74, 1998 \nTable 1 (a) Summary of Enting-Lassey parametric uncertainties.

Dur- \ning each MCS realisation, the random selections of the \nparameter and input values are treated differently. For \nthe parameters, the value is chosen at the start of the \nrealisation and held constant during the realisation; \nwhilst for the inputs, the value is chosen randomly at \neach time step during each realisation. This is because \nthe parameters are considered to be constant during \nthe whole realisation; whereas the inputs are assumed \nto be time series that vary continuously in a stochastic \nmanner over the specified simulation interval. Nor- \nmally, this means that they are defined either as: deter- \nministic or measured inputs, to which random noise \nwith a specified pdf is added (this is the approach used \nhere); or as time series generated by models such as a \nAutoregressive (AR), Autoregressive Integrated Mov- \ning Average (ARIMA), or Transfer Function (TF) mod- \nels with deterministic and stochastic inputs. Such time \nseries models are obtained usually from the analysis of \nthe available observational data, using statistical \nmethods of identification and parameter estimation \n(see e.g. Box & Jenkins 1970, Young 1984). In all these \ncases, however, the basic stochastic inputs that drive \nthe time series models are zero mean, serially uncorre- \nlated random variables ('white noise') with specified \npdf's. \nTable 1 summarises the means and standard devia- \ntions (under a Gaussian pdf assumption) of the para- \nmeters and inputs used in the MCS analysis. It is \nimportant to realise that all the model parameters and \ninputs are expressed in stochastic form in order to \ncarry out a complete analysis. Note also that these sta- \ntistical measures are derived as objectively as possible \nfrom independent sources, i.e. they are a priori values. \nModel parameter estimation (sometimes termed \n'model optirnisation', 'calibration' or 'fitting'), i.e. the \nsystematic adjustment of the parameter values so that \nthe model is in better agreement with observations \n(see later), is not carried out until it has been estab- \nlished whether the a prionmodel structure is a reason- \nable representation of the 'real world'. \nThe number of stochastic realisations, n, needed for \nthe MCS analysis is defined by the K-S statistic, i.e. \nwhere K, (for a confidence level a)  is read from statis- \ntical tables, and d is the level of difference allowed \nbetween 2 cfd curves before it is considered 'signifi- \ncant' (see e.g. Spear 1970). For the EL model, the dif- \nference is considered significant if the means or stan- \ndard deviations of histograms from 2 CO2 responses \nare different by more than 5% of the change in the \nmean CO2 level over the simulation period. Since the \nchange of the mean level over the simulation period is \napproximately 80 ppmv, therefore, the cfd curves must \ndiffer by more than 4 ppmv for significance. In this \nsituation, we find that 160 realisations are needed in \norder to detect a 'significant' difference. (For full \ndetails of this methodology, see e.g. Parkinson 1995.) \nGSA is a special, Monte Carlo-based method which \nprovides a means for objectively determining which of \nthe model parameters have the most significant effect \non a particular aspect of the model behaviour over the \nspecified simulation period. Here, a range of 'accept- \nable' behaviour is first defined for each model output. \nThen, if any of the outputs from a given realisation fall \noutside their respective ranges, this realisation and the \nmodel parameters which produced it are considered as \n'unacceptable' representations of the system. In this \nmanner, the parameter values which lead to such \nunacceptable behaviour are classified as part of the \n'not behaviour' (B) set; whilst those which result in \nacceptable response characteristics are classified as \npart of the 'behaviour' (B) set. Thus, the results from n \nrealisations produces nb values for each parameter in \nthe B set and (n - nb) values in the B set. For each para- \nmeter, K-S statistics are then used to find if there is a \nsignificant difference between the values in the B and \nB parameter sets (an example is given in Fig. 3) .  This \ninformation is valuable in many ways; for instance, it \nAtmospheric C& Conccnrra~ion (ppmv) \nFig. 3. Typical example of Kolmogorov-Srnirnov statistics \napplied to the results of Monte Carlo Simulation. The solid \nline and dashed line show the cfd curves obtained from 2 ver- \nsions of the Enting-Lassey model, whilst the dot-dashed line \nshows the magnitude of the difference between these 2 \ncurves. Since this difference never exceeds the level of sig- \nnificance (dotted line), the 2 versions are said to be 'not \nsignificantly different'. The curves could equally be from \n(a) a model and observations, or (b) 2 parameter sets, one of \n'acceptable behaviour' and the other not-see Section 3 \n164 Clim Res 9: \nreveals those parameters which are most important in \ndefining the specified behavioural pattern, and steps \ncan be taken to reduce the uncertainties associated \nwith these most sensitive parameters. It can also sug- \ngest those (normally few) physical mechanisms in the \nsimulation model that are most important in defining \ngiven behavioural phenomena and, conversely, those \naspects of the model which appear to play little part in \ndefining such behaviour. \nThe bands of acceptable behaviour are defined with \nreference to the observational record. Initially, in the \ncase of the EL model, the 95 % confidence limits asso- \nciated with the observed atmospheric CO2 concentra- \ntions (see Table 2) were used in this regard. However, \nit was found that these bands are so narrow compared \nwith the range of uncertainty generated from the MCS \nthat very few realisations exhibited the behaviour, i.e. \nnb was quite close to zero. Statistical analysis of such \nsmall sample sizes is naturally unreliable and so some \nway is needed to increase the number of acceptable \nrealisations. One approach is to increase the width of \none or more of the acceptability bands and, in this case, \na 5-fold increase in all the bands yields usable results. \nWhile this is a fairly crude adjustment, it still allows for \ndiscrimination between parameters which have a rela- \ntively large effect on the model and those that do not. \nMore rigorous enlargement of the 'behaviour space' \ncan be achieved using more complex 'parameter space \nadjustment' techniques (see e.g. Keesman 1990 and \nKeesman & van Straten 1990) but these were not \nutilised in the present preliminary study. \nFinally, Stochastic Model Optimisation can be car- \nried out using MCS. We propose this as a first stage in \nmodel optirnisation and fitting, to be carried out only \nafter the efficacy of the model structure has been con- \nfirmed. It is achieved by systematically adjusting the \ncomplete pdf's (i.e. the means and variances in the \nGaussian case considered here) of the statistically sig- \nnificant parameters, as indicated by the GSA, to pro- \nduce a model which yields the highest number of \nacceptable behaviour (B) realisations. For simplicity, in \nthis paper, only the means of the pdf's for the most sig- \nnificant parameters have been utilised for optimisa- \ntion, with the variances kept constant. However, this \nstill yields interesting results and suggests strongly \nthat certain of the a prioriassumptions about important \nparameter values should be investigated. \n4. SELECTION OF PARAMETERIC UNCERTAINTY \nLEVELS IN MCS \nOne of the most difficult and challenging aspects of \nMCS analysis applied to large deterministic models is \nthe selection of the uncertainty levels, particularly the \ndefinition of pdf's for the model parameters. In this sec- \ntion, we discuss the issues involved in this process and \nseek to justify the approximations utilised in the paper \nto circumvent these difficulties. Bearing in mind the \npossible effects of these approximations, we also stress \nthat the results of the subsequent MCS analysis must \nbe considered carefully, taking into full account the \npoints raised in this section. \nThe distributions should reflect the combined uncer- \ntainty associated with the system, as perceived by the \nscientific community, and we have obtained them as \nobjectively as possible from many sources, such as \npublished observations, calculations from independent \nmodelling exercises, and the opinions of experts in the \nfield (these sources are indicated in Table 1; full details \nare given in Parkinson 1995). However, since there is \nno truly objective method for carrying out this aspect of \nthe analysis, certain assumptions have to be made \nabout the nature of the pdf's. Some research workers in \nthe area (e.g. Oeschger et al. 1975, Siegenthaler & \nOeschger 1987, and subsequent studies used as a basis \nfor IPCC 1996) have suggested that there is a high \ndegree of correlation between several parameters, \nmost notably the vertical diffusion coefficient K and \nthe gas exchange coefficient K. However, these papers \nonly provide very limited information in this regard \nand certainly do not allow for the specification of a \ncomplete covariance matrix of the type required for \nMCS under the assumption that the model parameters \ncome from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. More- \nover, it should be noted that these previous studies \nhave used box-diffusion models similar to that consid- \nered here and so their results are not independent \nsources within the requirements of our study. In partic- \nular, since we are intending to assess the suitability of \nthe a priori model structure, we would run the risk of \nusing circular arguments. \nWith these observations in mind, we have reluctantly \nassumed that the parameters each come from indepen- \ndent Gaussian distributions defined by the mean val- \nues and variances obtained in the manner described \nabove (although any other distribution could have \nbeen used, and a uniform distribution might be better \njustified in certain circumstances). In MCS terms, this \nmeans that the parameter values for each stochastic \nrealisation are drawn at random from a multivariate \nGaussian distribution defined by the vector of mean \nparameter values and an  associated, purely diagonal, \ncovariance matrix with the assumed variances on the \ndiagonal, and zero covariance elements. \nThis assumption of statistical independence is, of \ncourse, a potentially limiting one, since the computed \nuncerta~nties in the MCS analysis will yield different \nresults from those obtained if the parameters had non- \nzero covariances. However, these are only initial \nParkinson & Young: Uncertainty and sensitivity in carbon cycle modelling 165 \nassumptions and, if better data and other independent \ninformation become available, they can be adjusted as \nnecessary. Moreover, in an attempt to address this \npotential problem, we have considered the effect on \nthe MCS results of reducing the a priori variances \nassociated with the independent parametric pdf's. Our \nreasoning in this regard is based on the fact that the \nassumption of statistical independence is equivalent to \nconsidering a probability ellipsoid in the associated \nparameter hyper-space, whose axes are aligned with \nthe axes of the space, and whose major and minor \ndiameters are dependent upon the assumed variances \nof the individual parameters. If the parameters are not \nindependent, however, this ellipsoid becomes both dif- \nferently oriented and shaped because of the non-zero \ncovariances. In particular, the existence of relatively \nlarge covariance elements can result in an ellipsoid \nwith large differences between the major and minor \ndiameters and, in the limit, the parameters concerned \nbecome linearly dependent and lie on a hyper plane. A \nsimple illustrative example is discussed in Appendix 1. \nAlthough it is impossible to evaluate directly how \nvalid this approximate approach to pdf selection may \nbe in the case of the full EL model, we have been able \nto investigate its consequences in relation to the \nreduced-order differential equation model approxima- \ntion to the EL model, as obtained by the DMA men- \ntioned in the 'Introduction' (see Young & Parkinson \n1996, Young et al. 1996). These references show that \nthis fourth order, linear differential equation approxi- \nmation (3 dominant modes plus an integrator to \naccount for mass conservation), which is obtained by \nreferring only to the unit impulse response of the EL \nmodel, yields an atmospheric CO2 response to the fos- \nsil fuel input record which is almost identical (99.99% \nof the response explained) to that of the full nonlinear \nEL model over the whole of  the historical period, \n1840 to 1990. Just as importantly for our present pur- \nposes, since DMA is based on statistical estimation, it \nyields the estimates of the reduced-order model para- \nmeters and their associated covariance matrix. Conse- \nquently, it is possible to compare the results obtained \nfrom MCS analysis applied to the reduced-order model \nusing both this full covariance matrix and its diagonal \napproximation. \nThe reduced-order differential equation model has \n7 parameters and the off-diagonal elements of the 7 X \n7 dimensional covariance matrix are relatively quite \nlarge, with the 2-dimensional projections of the associ- \nated probability ellipsoid indicating high levels of cor- \nrelation between the estimates. Despite this, however, \nthe MCS results obtained using the purely diagonal \napproximation to the covariance matrix, with no reduc- \ntion in magnitude, produce a lower variance ensemble \nof atmospheric CO2 responses than those obtained \nusing the full matrix above. On average, over a simula- \ntion period between 1840 and 2100, the standard devi- \nation of the ensemble about the mean response is 60 O\/u \nof that in the full matrix case (varying from approxi- \nmately 100 % between 1840 and 1940 to 30 % between \n2090 and 2100). In other words, the diagonal approxi- \nmatlon, which assumes independence in the paramet- \nric uncertainties, actually underestimates how the \neffects of this uncertainty propagate through the \nsystem. \nAlthough the full EL model may well not behave in a \nsimilar manner to the reduced order model in MCS \nanalysis, these results show that utilising a diagonal \napproximation to the covariance matrix does not nec- \nessarily amplify the effects of parametric uncertainty. \nIn particular, it cannot be assumed that such an \napproximation will result in more volatile and sensitive \nensemble MCS responses than would have been \nobtained if the full covariance matrix had been known \nand employed. For this reason, we believe that our \napproximate approach can be justified, particularly \nsince we also present the results obtained with a \nreduction in the magnitude of the elements in the diag- \nonal approximation of the covariance matrix (i.e. a \nreduction in the assumed uncertainties of the model \nparameters) and issue strong caveats about the inter- \npretation of the results. \n5. RESULTS FROM THE MONTE CARLO \nSIMULATION ANALYSIS \nThis section presents the results of the uncertainty \nand sensitivity analysis for the EL model. In Sub- \nsections 5.1 and 5.2, the comparative results from a \nnumber of different versions are discussed but, \nbecause the sensitivity analysis is very time consum- \ning, the remaining Sub-sections 5.3 to 5.5 are con- \ncerned only with version E29 (described below). This \nversion was selected for these more detailed studies \nsince its total carbon response matches the indepen- \ndent observations better than any of the other versions. \nIn addition to the analysis outlined in Section 3, Sub- \nsection 5.5 presents some 'predictive' results obtained \nby simulating the model into the future using an IPCC \nscenario, and then compares the resulting uncertainty \nwith that found in alternative deterministic studies. It \nshould be noted that, following normal convention, the \nuncertainties in all the results presented here relate to \nthe 95 % confidence limits (+2 standard  deviation^).^ \n3Note that this is not the same as the presentation of parame- \nter and input uncertainties (Table l), which quote 66% con- \nfidence limits (*l standard deviation) following Enting & \nLassey (1993) and Enting & Pearman (1983) \n166 Clirn Res 9: 157-174. 1998 \nI (I.) 6:'. the rtmorpherir IJC depletion \n- \n> 5 400 \n0 \n9 \n2 350 \nc 0 a\n2 3oo U \nC \nr 4\n2 250 \n- \n< \n-15001 \n1800 1850 1900 1950 2000 \nYear \n(a) PO, I h c  atmospheric CO2 concentratiorl \n- \n- \n.................................................. \n+ +W+ + ............ \n...... \n........... \n. ..................... \nFig. 4.

The \nE19 model results a re  shown here because its 13c \nresponse is closest to the observations; whilst, in the \ncase of the E29 model, the total carbon response \nmatches the observations very well. However, none of \nthe model versions yield results that are very similar to \nthe observed 14C m e a s ~ r e m e n t s . ~  \nThe most obvious thing to note about the results in \nTable 2 and the associated results obtained with other \nmodel versions is the much smaller level of uncertainty \nin the observed values compared with that generated \nby the MCS analysis. For p, and the MCS uncer- \ntainty is about 20 times larger than that in the observa- \ntions; whilst for &l3, the factor is about 6. This compar- \nison must be treated with caution, however, since the \nmodel is sensitive to the uncertainty in the parameters \nwhich define the pre-industrial levels of total carbon, \n'v and I4C (see Section 5 . 3 1 ~  and these are rather \nmore uncertain than the present day levels. Neverthe- \nless the discrepancy is still very large and it seems \nunlikely that this is the only reason for the major dif- \nferences revealed in Table 2. \nThere is clearly a large difference between the sto- \nchastic model results for I4C enhancement and the \nappropriate observations. The major problem appears \nto lie in the assumed mean parameter values. These \nare based on published values but they are rather dif- \nferent from those obtained by Enting & Lassey (1993), \nwhich are estimated using constrained numerical opti- \nmisation of the parameters in the model (see comments \n41t IS interesting to note that the budgeting of I4C in global \ncarbon cycle models is currently a controversial area (see \ne.g. Hessheirner et al. 1994) \n'The pre-industrial levels of total carbon and are defined \nexplicitly; that for '''C is calculated using other parameters, \ne .g .  I4C production rate \nPark~nson & Young: Uncertainty ar id sensit~vity in carbon cycle modelling 167 \nin the 'Introduction'). In order to maintain objectivity, \nhowever, we did not use these latter values, since they \nrelated specifically to exercises in model optimisation \napplied to the model under study, i.e. an assumption \nhas been made that the a priori model structure is \nvalid. Rather, we wished here to investigate the sto- \nchastic behaviour of the model using those parameter \nvalues which were considered by scientists to be most \nappropriate from a purely physical standpoint. This, \nwe believe, is the major role of MCS in simulation \nmodel evaluation. \nFollowing a request by I. G. Enting, however, we \nrepeated the analysis using the EL constrained optimi- \nsation parameters (i.e. estimated means for cosmic ray \nproduction of I4C of 5.2 kg yr-l rather than 6.5 kg yr-l; \nand a conversion factor for nuclear weapons input of \n2.8 kg kt-' rather than 4.5 kg kt-l). Not surprisingly, \nthis yields figures for A , ' ~  of 188 + 3 6 9 % ~  that are much \ncloser to the observed but still retain the significantly \nhigher 95 % confidence interval observed in the previ- \nous simulation exercises. While these results confirm \nthe efficacy of the Enting & Lassey constrained para- \nmeter optimisation, they also suggest that more consid- \neration should be given to the reasons for the differ- \nences between the optimised parameter values and the \nprior published values (see the later discussion in Sec- \ntion ? on the problems of scale in defining environ- \nmental model parameter v a l ~ e s ) . ~  \n5.2. Statistical comparison of modified versions of \nthe EL model \nStatistical comparison between the MCS results of \nall 32 versions of the EL model show that neither of \nthe oceanic detrital fluxes has any significant effect on \np, and &,l3; but together they have an effect on the \nlevel of Inclusion of a nonlinearly varying buffer \nfactor, as opposed to a constant value, has a signifi- \ncant effect on &l3, but not the other 2 outputs. Finally, \nland-use changes and CO2 fertilisation, both individu- \nally and in combination, make a significant difference \nto p, and &,l3, but not to Clearly, since all modifi- \ncations have a statistically significant effect on at least \none of the outputs, we cannot reject any as being \nredundant. \n\"t is interesting to note that recent work, published while the \npresent paper was being reviewed (Lassey et al. 1996), uses \nthe EL model with mean parameter values (particularly for \nthe eddy diffusion coefficient K and stratospheric turnover \ntime 7,,) based on more recent observations. This produces \nsignificantly better agreement with 14C observations and \ntends to confirm our comments \nAt this point, it is interesting to consider why the 3 \noutputs are affected significantly by different model \nmodifications. Many of the reasons for this are appar- \nent from considering the basic assumptions behind the \nEL model, and thus will not come as a surprise to \nglobal carbon cycle modellers: \n(1) The inclusion of the oceanic detrital fluxes acts \nto Increase the flow of carbon from the ocean's sur- \nface layers to the deep layers. Together, they have a \nsignificant effect on the level of I4C in the atmos- \nphere, but not on the levels of total carbon or I3C. It is \nlikely that this is due to the changes that these fluxes \nwould cause in the pre-industrial level of I4C, which is \nnot fixed, unlike the pre-industrial levels of the other \n2 outputs. \n(2) The adjustment of the buffer factor from a con- \nstant to a nonlinear relation causes a reduction in the \nair-to-sea flux with increasing atmospheric levels. The \nmain reason why this study found only &,l3 to be signif- \nicantly affected is because the other outputs were not \nperturbed far enough away from their equilibrium \npoints: larger perturbations to the model would lead to \nthe nonlinearity having a larger (and eventually signif- \nicant) effect. The greater uncertainty in p, and A , ' ~  \nprobably helped to contribute to masking any differ- \nences. \n(3) Land-use changes constitute an input of carbon to \nthe atmosphere, whereas CO2 fertilisation acts as an  \noutput. In combination, they nearly cancel each other \nout; nevertheless, individually or together, they still \nhave a significant effect on the atmospheric levels of \ntotal carbon and I3C. The fact that the 14C level is not \nsignificantly affected is because the atmospheric box \nhas the same '\"\/C ratio as the biosphere, which is \ndeliberate and is based on observations. \nObviously, many of the reasons for the presence or \nabsence of a significant effect of a given modification \non the outputs are intended and so, in this case, the \nstatistical comparison of model versions has yielded lit- \ntle new information. Nevertheless, we have shown \nhow this methodology can be used to clarify how a \nmodel is operating. \nIt is also important to point out here that the signifi- \ncance or otherwise of a modification depends on the \nchoice of the outputs, simulation period and the point \nduring the simulation at  which analysis is carried out. \nFurther, various modifications made to global carbon \ncycle models are carried out because of their perceived \nimportance in determining future effects; conse- \nquently, if there is a lack of significant information on \nthese effects in past observations, then they will be \nrejected by an analysis such as ours. Nevertheless, if \nthis analysis is carried out carefully, it can help in \ndeciding whether there is sufficient justification for the \ninclusion of a given modification. \nClim Res 9: 157-174, 1998 \nTable 3.

GSA and the evaluation of 'significant' model \nparameters \nThe results of the GSA analysis applied to EL version \nE29 are summarised in Table 3. In testing for 'signifi- \ncant' parameters, the K-S statistics assign a value \nbetween 0 and 1 to each parameter: the higher the \nvalue, the more significant the parameter is in deter- \nmining whether the model response is 'acceptable'. \nThe level of statistical significance in this case is 0.161. \nAs can be seen, the 14C production rate from cosmic \nrays, o, is the most significant parameter. This is not \nsurprising since, as pointed out in Section 5.1, its value \nmakes a considerable difference as to whether the 14C \nmodel response is close to the observed level or not. \nThe significance of the pre-industrial levels of CO2 \nand I3C are also to be expected since their uncertain- \nties are much wider than the present day levels used \nfor comparison, and so variation in their values would \nchange the model response noticeably. However, the \npresence of the other 3 parameters [the pre-industrial \nsize of the old biosphere, (No),,; the net primary pro- \nduction, PN; and the air-sea exchange time, z,,] is not \nso obvious. Again, it is likely that their significance is \ndue to their comparatively high levels of uncertainty, \nbut it is also possible that the processes they represent \nare more important in determining atmospheric CO2 \nlevels than other parts of the model. This shows the \npotver of this method in picking up less obvious \nsources of model sensitivity. \n5.4. Stochastic Model Optimisation \nApproximate stochastic optimisation of EL version \nE29 is carried out by varying the means of the pdf's of \nthe 6 most 'significant' parameters found using GSA \n(Table 3) .  Parameter interaction was suspected be- \ntween (p,),, and (6,'3)pi, the pre-industrial levels of total \ncarbon and I3C in the atmosphere; and also between \n(NJPi, the pre-industrial size of the old biosphere, and \nPN, net primary production.

However, T, (No)pi and \n(S,'3)pi need to be adjusted quite considerably (by \naround 2 standard deviations) to yield optimum (or \neven near optimum) results. Parameter mean values \nthat produce the approximately optimum (or near op- \ntimum) model in this stochastic sense are given in \nTable 4. \nAlso shown in Table 4 ,  for comparison, are the \nresults of the deterministic, constrained 'least squares' \nmodel optimisation carried out by Enting & Lassey \n(1993). As can be seen, there is some difference \nbetween the 2 sets of results. In part, however, this is \ndue to the differences in default values used by the 2 \nmethods. For example, in the case of (pJpi, there is \nvery little change between the default and optimal \nmeans in both cases; and for z,,,, the changes are of \nsimilar magnitude.

However, the comparatively large changes \nwhich lead to the optimal values in the unconstrained \nstochastic case considered here rather call into ques- \ntion Enting & Lassey's decision to constrain them. \nTo summarise, the probability of acceptable behaviour \nin model version E29 is approximately doubled by ad- \njusting the means of the pdf's associated with several of \nthe significant parameters. Moreover, to achieve this \nhigh level of probability, relatively large changes, of \naround 2 standard deviations (i.e. to the edge of the 95 % \nconfidence interval), need to be made to certain of these \nparameters. Comparison of these results with those ob- \ntained using deterministic optinlisation reveal some sirn- \nilarities, with the main differences being due to para- \nmeters concerned with the minor isotopes.

It must be remem- \nbered, however, that the stochastic model optinlisation \nused here is still quite crude and so conclusions based on \nit are fairly speculative at this stage. \n5.5. Uncertainty in future projections of CO2 levels \nThe final set of MCS results are obtained by extend- \ning the time period of interest up to the year 2100 in \norder to provide data pertaining to the debate on \nanthropogenic climate change. Extra model inputs for \nfossil fuel and land-use changes during this time span \nare based on the IPCC scenario IS92a (IPCC 1992). It \nmust be emphasised that version E29 is used with its \noriginal, a priori, pdf's, rather than either the optimised \nvalues discussed in the previous Section 5.4 or those of \nEnting & Lassey. This is in line with our previous con- \ncentration on the a priori parameter values considered \nby scientists to be most appropriate from a purely \nphysical standpoint, but it is also because the model \nincorporating the adjusted values has not been vali- \ndated against independent data. \nFig. 6 shows the stochastic evolution of the atmos- \npheric CO, concentration, p,, produced by E29 \nbetween 1990 and 2100.' The dashed lines show the \nuncertainty (95% confidence limits) in the evolution, \nwhich grows steadily throughout the simulation period \nfrom 351 i 43 ppmv in 1990 to 664 +. 144 ppmv in 2100. \nSince the assumption of parametric independence is \n'In this study, it is assumed that there is an uncertainty of \n25% in converting a political scenario, such as IS92a, into \nyearly fossil fuel emissions and of 50 % in converting it into \nland-use change flux.

Simulation (3), which grows \nfrom 353 * 2 ppmv in 1990 to 669 * 48 ppmv in 2100, is \nshown by the dot-dashed lines in Fig. 6. Of the three, \nthis method naturally produces the output evolution \nwith lowest level of uncertainty. \nFinally, in Table 5, the results of the above 4 stochas- \ntic simulations are compared with those from 3 deter- \nministic modelling exercises, including those of IPCC \n(1995)1\u00b0. It is clear that the uncertainty produced by the \nMCS analysis is much larger than that arising from the \ndeterministic methods; in particular, the level of output \nuncertainty generated by using the original parametric \nand input uncertainties is between 5 and 10 times \nlarger. Even when we consider the stochastic simula- \ntion with the narrowest output uncertainty (method 3). \nwhich will probably attract the least criticism from \nglobal carbon cycle modellers, these bands are still \n50% wider than the widest of the deterministic results. \nIt is likely that this difference would be larger still if the \nstochastic methodology was to be applied to a range of \nglobal carbon cycle models, as in the deterministic \nIPCC simulation studies. \n6. LIMITATIONS OF THE ANALYSIS \nEvaluating the effects of uncertainty on a fairly com- \nplex, deterministic simulation model is beset with \nmany difficulties and it is important that the limitations \nof the analysis carried out in this paper should be taken \nfully into account when evaluating the results pre- \nsented in previous sections. In this regard, the follow- \ning points should be noted. \n(1) In the absence of independent evidence to the \ncontrary, the assumed probability distribution func- \n'A consequence of this is that the uncertainty (66'Yo confi- \ndence limits) of the pre-industrial level of CO2, (p,),, is thus \nreduced from 275 & 15 ppmv to 275 * 7.5 ppmv which is \ncloser to the uncertainty discussed in Schimel et al.

(1994) \ntions of the parameters and inputs are taken to be \nindependent and Gaussian. These may well be flawed \nassumptions but it is difficult to use any others, given \nthe possibility of circularity in selecting parametric val- \nues, as mentioned in Section 4. If new information \nwere to become available, modifications to the analysis \nwould be required. The choice of the means and stan- \ndard deviations of the assumed probability distribution \nfunctions is also somewhat subjective; other re- \nsearchers in this field may have rather different ideas \nof these values. If any of these possibilities are con- \nfirmed, then it is likely that the uncertainty associated \nwith the Monte Carlo realisations could be different to \nthat obtained in the present study. \n(2) The definition of 'significance' associated with \nthe MCS analysis is somewhat subjective; and again, \nother researchers may disagree with that used in the \npresent paper \n(3) For convenience in the present initial study, the \nmodel response has only been studied at one point \nduring a 225 yr period. This may be unrepresentative, \nand so it would be better to consider several different \nyears during the simulation; or, ideally, to evaluate the \nstochastic response at every annual step. \n(4) Only 3 model variables have been considered as \noutputs; many more could be chosen and studied \n(including, perhaps, the model's eigenvalues); and \nsuch analysis may well yield other interesting results. \n(5) The GSA has suffered from the large difference \nbetween the uncertainty in the model results and that \nin the observations. We chose to handle this by increas- \nParkinson & Young: Uncertdinty ai nd sensitivity In carbon cycle modelling 171 \ning the width of the uncertainty bands on the data; on \nthe other hand, it might have been better to reduce the \nuncertainty levels on the parameters, given the rather \nsubjective nature of their specification and the potential \nproblems of scale mentioned above. Improvement in \nthe GSA analysis might also be achieved by using a \nmore robust method, such as the 'set-membership' \ntechnique of Keesman & van Straten (1990). \nWe do not believe that these various limitations sen-  \nously affect the general conclusions derived from the \nanalysis reported here, provided our caveats are  \nheeded carefully. Neither do they lessen the useful- \nness of the stochastic simulation approach, especially \nsince the emphasis of most other studies in this area \nincludes only deterministic sensitivity analysis, which \nis clearly less flexible and of more limited value than \nthe stochastic alternative considered here. In many \nways, our initial results are illustrative of what can be \nachieved by MCS\/GSA analysis and a more detailed \ninvestigation of the EL and other global models is a \nlogical next step, together with some refinement of the \nanalysis in the light of the current results. \n7. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS \nWith the advent of modern fast computers, MCS \nanalysis now provides a simple and practical method \nfor quantifying the effects of stochastic uncertainty in \nreasonably large and complex, nonlinear simulation \nmodels. The study of global carbon cycle modelling \ncarried out in this paper has involved the application of \nsuch MCS analysis, and other methods of dynamic \nmodel evaluation, to scientifically acceptable models \nof global energy balance and the global carbon cycle \n(Parkinson 1995). A companion paper (Young et  al. \n1996) has concentrated on the methodological aspects \nof the study and its place within a framework of model \nbuilding, which includes data-based modelling; while \nthe present paper outlines the initial results obtained \nfrom the MCS studies, which have been concerned \nwith the well known Enting-Lassey modified box-dif- \nfusion model of the global carbon cycle (Enting & \nLassey 1993). \nAlthough the main aim of this research has been to \nsuggest and investigate a general MCS approach to \nevaluating the effects of uncertainty in global carbon \ncycle models, the results obtained from its application \nto the EL model have also provided interesting addi- \ntional insight into the nature of this model and its \npotential utility in global climate studies. We have \nfound that, whilst the EL model appears to simulate the \nmovement of total carbon quite well using fixed para- \nmeter values, it is characterised by a relatively high \ndegree of inherent sensitivity to uncertainty in some of \nthe parameter values. This tends to confirm the earlier \nresults of Gardner & Trabalka (1985) using a different \nglobal carbon cycle model. \nIn addi t~on,  the results of stochastic s~mulation pro- \njections up to the year 2100 yield a much wider uncer- \ntainty range than those obtained from deterministic \nmodelling exercises using the same input scenarios. \nEven when the parametric and input uncertainties a re  \nreduced by a factor of 2 (to account for possible corre- \nlation between parameters, a s  discussed in Section 4)  \nand the simulation is constrained to produce the \nobserved CO2 level in 1990, the stochastic output \nuncertainty is still 50 % higher than the highest compa- \nrable estimate found using deterministic methods. \nWhile this level might be reduced if the EL model is \nconstrained using the full CO2 history, it could be  \nincreased if the stochastic analysis were to be applied \nto other global carbon cycle models currently consid- \nered realistic (and used to produce the uncertainty \nestimate in Schimel et al. 1995). We believe that these \nresults should at least be taken into account when \nevaluating such projections for policy purposes. \nOne reason why the EL model is sensitive to para- \nmetric uncertainty a t  the levels used in our MCS analy- \nsis could be that the parameter values are  based on \nindirect observations a t  different scales to that on \nwhich the model is based-mainly local or regional \nfield studies and\/or laboratory measurements. It is cer- \ntainly not obvious that parameters obtained at  these \nsmaller scales are  completely relevant to those used a t  \na much larger scale, as in global simulation studies, \nand this may lead to incorrect estimation of the uncer- \ntainties involved at this larger scale. This probably \naccounts, at  least in part, for the differences in the a \npriori assumed values for the parameters in the EL \nmodel and those obtained by model optimisation, \nwhether deterministic (as in Enting & Lassey 1993) or \nstochastic (as in the present paper). We believe that \nthis question of scale in global simulation modelling \n(or, indeed, in most other areas of environmental mod- \nelling) is most important, particularly with regard to \nthe specification of parameter values. Certainly, it is \ndeserving of much greater attention than it has \nreceived heretofore, given the importance of mecha- \nnistic simulation models in environmental research. \nIn the paper, MCS has also been used to evaluate \nwhether the addition of extra complexity to the model \nmakes a statistically significant difference to the model \nresponse. In this case, all 5 of the modifications sug- \ngested by Enting & Lassey, and considered in the pre- \nsent study, affect at  least 1 of the outputs significantly, \nand so none a re  rejected a s  being redundant. On the \nother hand, it is important to note the results obtained \nwhen GSA is applied to the EL model version E29, \nwhose response is closest to the observed CO2 levels. \nClim Res 9: 157-174, 1998 \nThese show that, from over 20 parameters, only a few \nappear to have a statistically significant effect on the \nmodel output, implying that a reduction in the uncer- \ntainty of these significant parameters should be a prior- \nity for improving the stochastic nature and reljability of \nthe EL model. In particular, since the significance of the \npre-industrial level of atmospheric CO2 in the present \nEL model concurs with a similar result obtained by \nGardner & Trabalka (1985) using a different global car- \nbon cycle model and a somewhat different type of sto- \nchastic sensitivity analysis, it is clear that this parameter \nis deserving of still greater attention in future studies. \nThese GSA results suggest that, while the EL model \nis a quite complex, high order set of nonlinear differ- \nential equations defined by a relatively large number \nof parameters, its dynamic behaviour is influenced \nmainly by a much smaller number of 'important' para- \nmeters. In addition, all of the MCS ensemble responses \ngenerated in our study have approximately Gaussian \namplitude distributions and, since the parametric and \ninput uncertainties are also Gaussian, this indicates \nthat the nonlinear elements of the model are not being \nexcited to any great extent. Such simplifying conjec- \ntures are supported by the results obtained from the \nnovel dominant mode analysis reported in Young et al. \n(1996), where the whole topic of reduced-order models \nand domlnant mode behaviour is discussed in greater \ndetail. These results suggest that the model behaviour \nis characterised by only a small number of dominant, \nlinear dynamic modes, and that much of the inherent \ncomplexity of the simulation, including nonlinearity, is \nhaving only a small effect on the main model outputs \nover the historic period, where the model has been \noptimised in relation to observational data. \nIf they are confirmed by later, more detailed analy- \nses, these model simplification results may have impor- \ntant implications for the interpretation of the long term \npredictions obtained from the EL and other similar \nmodels (e.g.  the prediction of the future atmospheric \nCO2 concentrations well into the next century). For \ninstance, if the nonlinearities in the model have not \nbeen activated sufficiently over the historical period, as \nour results suggest, then the constrained optimisation \nresults obtained by fitting the model to data over this \nsame historical period cannot be considered com- \npletely satisfactory in this regard. Consequently, any \nmodel predictions that are affected to any appreciable \ndegree by these estimated nonlinearities must be seri- \nously questioned before the predictions are utilised for \nother purposes. More generally, the implications of the \nuncertaint~es associated with all the parameters in the \nmodel, including those that are assumed known in the \nconstrained optimisation exercises, must also be evalu- \nated very carefully. In particular, their effect on the \nmodel predictions need.s to be acknowledged and \ninvestigated fully before the policy implications of the \npredictive results can be properly evaluated. \nFinally, it is important to stress that the above con- \nclusions are based only on a preliminary study of the \nEL model. A great deal more analysis could be per- \nformed, following discussion of these initial results \nwith experts on global carbon cycle modelling. It is felt \nthat such further studies are essential before any \nfirmer conclusions can be reached. In this regard, we \nhope that the results presented in this paper will help \nto stimulate further research on the effects of uncer- \ntainty in global climate models. \nAppendix 1. Covanance matrices and probab~lity ellipsoids \nConsider 2 Gaussian distributions with the same mean \nvector a, = [ l 0  20jTbut the following, different, covariance \nmatrices \nSince C, is diagonal, the parameter values drawn from this \ndistribution are statistically independent; whereas in the \ncase of CNl, the parameters are correlated because of the \nsignificant off-diagonal elements. In this case, by reducing \nthe variances (i.e. the diagonal elements) in C, by a factor \nof 10, i t  is possible to approximately inscribe the resulting \nsmaller probability ellipse (in this 2-parameter space) \nwithln the ellipse defined by C, , ,  so reducing the uncer- \ntainty in the region of the mean values to levels which are \ncomparable with those defined by CN\/ in this same central \nregion. \nIn relat~on to the variance reduction exercises in the MCS \nanalysis carried out in this paper, note the following com- \nments: \n(1) If the variance reduction reasonably achieves its objec- \ntive, then the uncertainty injected into the system could be \nless than the actual, since parts of the 'true' hyper-ellip- \nsoid are then not explored in the MCS analysis. In other \nwords, the analysis in this situation might even be conser- \nvative and so underestimate the effects of uncertainty \n(see, for instance, the example in the main text where \nunderestimation occurs even w~thout variance reduction) \n(2) Although the region explored by the MCS is smaller if \nthe variances are reduced, this exploration is still carried \nout under the assumption that the parameters are inde- \npendent, which could possibly amplify the effects of \nuncertainty in this smaller reglon. \n(3) The situation may well not be as bad as that in the sim- \nple example above, where the off-diagonal elements in \nCNI have been selected so that the parameters are highly \ncorrelated and the matrix is very near to singularity (which \noccurs when these elements are set to about 1.2649 and \nthe 2 parameters become linearly dependent). If the off- \ndiagonal elements are chosen as unity rather than 1.25, for \nexample, then the 2 distributions cover quite similar \nregions of th(? parameter space. Of course, comment (2) \nstill applies in this situation, so that the level of irnprove- \nment will be a function of the unknown covanances and so \nis difficult to assess. \nParkinson & Young: Uncertainty and s e n s ~ t ~ v ~ t y  in carbon cycle modelling 173 \nAcknowledgements.
