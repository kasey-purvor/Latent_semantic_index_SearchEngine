Introduction \nOperations Management (OM) education employs a wide variety of games (Riis and \nMikkelsen 1995), ranging from simple \u201etabletop\u201f (Robinson and Robinson 1994) and \n\u201ered bead\u201f experiments (Deming 1986), to system simulations like the Beer (Forrester \n1961, Senge 1990) and Cuppa Manufacturing games (Ammar and Wright 1999), to \nmuch more complex interactive environments such as a \u201etraining factory\u201f (Haapsato \nand Hyv\u00f6nen, 2001). This interest in \u201eplaying\u201f can be explained in a number of ways. \nGames and simulations address specific OM concerns that the \u201c\u2026interesting and \nchallenging issues \u2026 are difficult to convey effectively in a purely theoretical setting \n[because] students need some way to directly experience the issues involved in \noperating a production system\u201d (Ammar and Wright 1999, p. 183). This can be \nparticularly important when the taught course represents a students\u201f first exposure to \noperations management practice but experienced students can also find their own \nknowledge a barrier to new concepts. More generally therefore, gaming promotes \n\u201eexperiential learning\u201f by providing a shared \u201econcrete experience\u201f (Kolb, 1985) that \nmany argue allows the student to explore theory and practice more critically and \n(hopefully) memorably (McKenney 1962; 1967, McKenney and Dill 1962; Haapasalo \nand Hyv\u00f6nen 2001). Additionally, some authors (e.g. Smeds 1997) have argued that \nthere is potential to use gaming as a form of \u201eco-production\u201f of knowledge that might \novercome traditional barriers to academic-practitioner knowledge transfer.  \n \nThis paper was motivated in large part by the authors\u201f practical experiences of game \nplaying in an educational context. Both felt that they had developed \u201eexperiential\u201f \ninsight into a range of specific games but lacked (1) a conceptual schema for \nunderstanding the educational process involved and (2) a comprehensive guide to \nboth the educational content and playing process of OM-specific games. The paper \nbegins by discussing the general historical and conceptual antecedents of teaching \nwith \u201eorganisation-themed\u201f games.  Concepts are extracted from existing definitions \nof games and a generic transformation model of game playing in OM is proposed.  \nThen using a range of secondary data, specifically a survey of 222 OM-specific and \nOM-related games derived from published gaming texts and references, two \nempirical research questions are tackled.  Firstly, what is the content of OM games?  \nThis is an important question as the nature of OM has changed significantly in the \nrecent past, and we need to establish whether the games\u201f content has kept pace with \nthis change. Secondly, what is the process for the games?  Specifically, how long do \nthey take, how many people are involved and what is the level of complexity and the \nphysical requirements? The paper concludes with recommendations for further work. \n 3 \n \n2. Conceptual Background \nTo think about playing a game is, for most people, to consider engaging in a diverting \n(i.e. not serious) mental and\/or physical activity that might involve other people. At \nthe same time, other participants can treat exactly the same set of activities very \nseriously indeed. Players of even the most apparently trivial games can be \n\u201eprofessional\u201f and some earn huge salaries from participating. Moreover, the \neconomics of these earnings are dependent upon large numbers of people (i.e. \nspectators, fans, etc.) deriving pleasure from simply watching their game play. In \naddition to various forms of entertainment, games are used in teaching (from primary \nto post-graduate level), training, therapy\/diagnosis and experimentation (Shubik \n1975a). There are also many pejorative connotations to games - many managers for \ninstance, will assert that they have to \u201eplay the game\u201f if they want to get on in their \norganisation (Weir 1997). In other words, although games and game playing are \ndeeply ingrained in human nature (Homo Ludens: Huizinga 1971), they remain \ncomplex and ambiguous phenomena. \n \n2.1. The Development of Educational Game Playing \nAlthough the precise origins of games designed to represent and thereby \u201eeducate\u201f \nplayers in aspects of organisational life are difficult to establish, three specific \nhistorical developments are worth highlighting. \n \nFirst, most early writers on business gaming drew heavily on the notions of \ncompetitive conflict implicit in military and political games (e.g. Shubik 1975b, Bowen \n1978). The history of military gaming is particularly important, including chess-type \ngames in prehistoric India, kriegspiel (German: krieg \u2013 war; spiel \u2013 game) in 19th \ncentury Prussia and modern US IT-integrated war planning (Shubik 1975a, 1975b, \nAllen 1987). Similarly, in the years following WWII a number of defence-related \ninstitutes (e.g. RAND Corporation) developed a range of strategic and operational \n\u201egames\u201f based upon principles of operational research and game theory.  How and \nwhether these should be counted as \u201egames\u201f is discussed in the next section. \n \nSecond, the proliferation of management (Gordon and Howell 1959) and industrial \nengineering courses (Emerson and Naehring 1984) created a context where games \ncould create educational market value (e.g. \u201c\u2026with the increasing general \nrecognition of the importance of the management profession has come insistence on \nbetter and shorter methods of acquiring management experience \u2013 at least \n 4 \nvicariously\u201d: Graham and Gray 1969, p.17). This pressure on staff and timetables has \nnot in any sense decreased in the intervening years.  In an early example (1956) of a \nbusiness game, the American Management Association created the \u201cTop \nManagement Decision Simulation\u201d. Within ten years a survey revealed that two-thirds \nof US business schools had adopted related gaming techniques (Klasson 1964).  \n \nFinally, the widespread adoption of gaming approaches was enabled by the \nemergence of affordable (micro-) computing power - albeit in the first instance \naffordable only to the large corporation and\/or university. Today, ever greater \nprocessing power and network interactivity at lower cost has meant that complex \nsimulation is now possible using ordinary desktop PCs. As a result many games, \nespecially those \u201cfocus[ed] on a single, specialized phenomenon\u201d (Elgood 1997, \npp.12) are heavily IT-dependent.   \n \nIn addition, given this broad and extended heritage, it is unsurprising to discover \u201cthat \ndifferent traditions\u2026have their own [gaming-related] terminology and specific \nconnotations are attached to it. Definitions therefore remain a significant problem, \nand users of management games sometimes appear to be talking at cross \npurposes.\u201d (Elgood 1997, p.11). Definitional issues are therefore clearly of \nimportance and Table 1 presents a chronological series of competing definitions. \nDespite all the points of divergence and the confusing overlaps between definitions \n(games, simulations, simulation games, etc.) it is still possible to identify a number of \ncommon themes that can form a usefully generic conceptualisation of gaming and \nhelp in the consideration of the process of gaming. \n \n 5 \n \nTERM DEFINITION NOTES \nBusiness \nGame \n\u201c\u2026simplified abstractions of a situation related to the \nbusiness world.

In \nbehavioural simulations [to illustrate group behaviour] \nsome of the main decisions might be how participants \nuse their time and the amount and manner of \ncommunications with others\u201d (p.20). \nGame Activities with some\/all following characteristics: \n\u201chuman opponents, actions have an effect upon each \nother and environment; emphasis on competitiveness \nand \u201ewinning\u201f; emphasis on humour and enjoyment; \nrepetitive cycle of making decisions and encountering \nresult, allowing hope of improvement and \u201edoing better \nnext time\u201f.\u201d (Elgood 1997, p.12). \nA business game (or simulation) is simply one having \nan \u201cindustrial, commercial or financial background\u201d. A \nmanagement game (or simulation) is one concerned \nwith the planning, management and control of any \norganization or project in circumstance where profit is \nnot the dominant measure of success.\u201d \n \nTable 1. Defining Games, Business Games and Simulations (Chronological Order) \n \nAs can be seen, there are some common themes emerging from the definitions \nabove \u2013 notably that simulations and games appear to be different.  Specifically, a \n 6 \nsimulation is a simplified, abstracted model with rules; a game is when people have \nthe opportunity to \u201eplay\u201f within the environment of the simulation (Schrage, 1999).  \nFrom the above it appears that there are two non-exclusive elements of this play; the \nfirst is competitive, the second experimental.  The first is an opportunity harness the \ndynamic of having other people trying to achieve the same thing.  Such competition, \nwe have observed to be almost always beneficial to the student experience, creating \nan additional pressure analogous to a competitive market.  The second kind of play, \nis the experiment \u2013 giving the opportunity to see the effects of one or other strategy, \nbut without having the benefit of a human competitor.   \n \nAn element that comes through of the gaming process, is of \u201cdeveloping \nunderstanding of the process\u201d (Bowen, 1978) \u201cwithout being overwhelming,\u201d \n(McKenny, 1967).  This shows that part of the process of gaming is a sensemaking \none (Weick, 1995) and that this can usefully be guided by the tutor or umpire.  \nMoreover, it is clear that gaming is not simply a mental exercise (cf. McKenny, 1967).  \nIn OM games, particularly production scenarios, there are regularly artefacts that are \nchanged by the gaming process.  Process-based analysis is at the root of OM \nteaching, and includes the most basic of considerations \u2013 the transformation model.   \nThis is now applied to the gaming process. \n \n2.2. A Transformation Model of Game Playing \nRather than propose yet another definition this paper argues that because there are \nfactors common to all games, OM game playing can be usefully represented (see \nFigure 1) by a transformation (i.e. input  process  output) model.  \n \n 7 \n \nFigure 1. An \u201eInput  Process  Output\u201f Model of OM Gaming \n \nThe generic model shows the three major inputs being the players, the umpire and \nthe artefacts of the game, and the nature of the transformation process.  Artefacts \nare the whole supporting infrastructure, including any IT support, physical resources \nand information provided to the player.  The transformation is predominantly focused \non the ideas of the players and umpire.  During the process, basic sensemaking is \nidentified through the first two stages that participants have to complete, and the \ndecisions that they make before doing the physical activity of the game, if appropriate. \n \nThe model of the process is also useful in the analysis of the role of IT within an OM \ngame, following the basic principle of operations that the process should be \nunderstood and simplified before being automated.  A piece of software for instance, \ncan potentially aid in the introduction and explanation of the game.  Where a \u201ereal\u201f \nelement of a game is used however, it may be inappropriate to be able to ensure that \nrules are upheld, but is excellent at calculating results, for instance. \n \nIn order to clarify the generic model, it is helpful to populate it with the characteristics \nof a specific OM-related teaching game: Cuppa Manufacturing1. This game is \ndesigned to illustrate the advantages and principles of Just-In-Time production \nsystems over traditional batch and queue.  The scenario is a model of a basic \n                                                     \n1 The precise origins of this JIT game are unclear. The authors first encountered the game being played by Professor Denis \nSeverance of Michigan University but Ammar and Wright (1999) cite a Cornell University product development module \n(Jackson 1996) as the source. \nModel \/ Abstracted Reality \nPlayers \nArtefacts \nUmpire \nWhat is going on?

Inputs \nIn the Cuppa Manufacturing game, players are allocated specific tasks detailed in the \nrules. One acts as a supplier, providing all raw materials to each of the four \nworkstation players (in order: place cups in tray; stick dots to side of cups; place lids \non cups; unwrap straws and insert into lids) and another acts as final quality \ncontrol\/shipping co-ordinator. Depending upon the size of the group, additional jobs \ncan be allocated - such as production manager, time and motion consultant, \ncustomers, etc. The rules include a demand requirement and prescribe both the \nproduct assembly process and the initial configuration of the production system. In \nterms of artefacts, cups, lids, straws, red dots and trays, and stopwatches are made \navailable so that players (and observers) can time different activities. Also, the game \nneeds to take place in a large enough space to allow 3 or 4 large tables to be placed \nside-by-side. \n \n2.2.2. Process \nIn common with many \u201eorganisational\u201f games, it is normal that players initially feel \nsomewhat bemused and therefore the umpire needs to be very familiar with all of the \ntasks.  This is to allow the first two stages of the gaming process to be accomplished \nas the players make sense of the environment.  It is notable how different groups, \neven within a fairly homogeneous cohort, have radically different speeds in \nsatisfactorily achieving this.  In many games, the level of control exerted by the \numpire is deliberately minimal \u2013 despite the game being based upon a complex set of \nrules \u2013 with the implicit purpose of allowing players to \u201efigure it out\u201f for themselves \nand thereby explore their own (and\/or colleague) behaviour in the light of specific \nscenarios. At the same time, in order to aid the \u201eteaching\u201f of specific content (i.e. \ntheories, hypotheses etc.), other games are carefully controlled so that \u201eevents of \ninterest\u201f actually occur and corresponding principles can be demonstrated. \n \nThe second part of the gaming process comprises two basic components: the \nsequential or simultaneous decisions made and activities completed by the players \nand, the interventions made by the game umpires. Some planning is allowed off-line \nto allow the players to simulate the process themselves, before the actual timed \nproduction process starts. \n \n 9 \nThe Cuppa Manufacturing game is based upon the repetitive assembly of a tray of \nfour \u201efast food\u201f cups complete with lids, straws and a red-coloured adhesive dot. \nFigure 2 illustrates the basic cup sub-assembly. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Single Unit Product (cup sub-assembly) for Cuppa Manufacturing Game (4 per tray) \n \n\u201eIterative play\u201f  in this case is usually structured around three or four \u201erounds\u201f where \nparticipants are given the opportunity to \u201eimprove\u201f the production system. The first \niteration replicates a classic batch (e.g. 4 trays per batch) push production system. \nInventory quickly builds as imbalances in the line become clear, table space is used \nup and process control (e.g. consistent placing of coloured dots) becomes impossible. \nA tracer tray (e.g. with a coloured edge) can then introduced to obtain a throughput \ntime. Additional quality problems can also be deliberately introduced: such as the \nreplacement of red dots with blue ones, this change often goes unnoticed until final \ninspection (or the customers\u201f goods inwards receipt).  After 10-15 minutes of play, \nmost of the problems with the system should be apparent and the game can be \nhalted. The umpire then challenges the players to measure what is going on and try \nto analyse what is going wrong. Performance metrics used include: work-in-process, \ntable space, throughput time, output efficiency, defect levels etc. The extent to which \nimprovements carried forward into subsequent \u201erounds\u201f are entirely selected by the \nplayers (e.g. analysis often leads players to argue for additional workers and space \nat bottlenecks and\/or for the introduction of additional quality control checks) or \ndriven forward by the umpire (e.g. \u201cnext round we\u201fll try a batch of 4 pull system\u201d) will \ndepend upon the overall purpose of the game, the time available, the type of players \netc. Typically, round two will involve a \u201epush four\u201f system with better balancing, round \nthree will move towards a \u201epull four\u201f system and round four will further reduce the \nbatch size.  The game does not require any IT support, and can be played in either \ncompetitive or non-competitive modes. \n \nstraw \nlid \ncoloured \nadhesive dot \npolystyrene cup \n4-cup tray \n 10 \n2.2.3. Outcomes \nA key component of any game will normally be some kind of measurable \nperformance outcome \u2013 the results. This, allied with competitive dynamics, can be an \nimportant source of individual and group motivation and therefore any scoring system \nneeds to be perceived as either intrinsically fair and\/or reflective of a \u201ereal world\u201f \noutcome. Players of the Cuppa Manufacturing game can quickly see the impact of \nproduction imbalance, high levels of WIP and experiment with pull production \nsolutions. Given that \u201elean\u201f production techniques can seem (at least initially) to be \nsomewhat counter-intuitive, the discovery that smaller batch sizes, less space and \nfewer staff can actually create a more effective (i.e. faster) and efficient system is \noften hugely revelatory (Ammar and Wright describe (rather worryingly?) how \u201cmany \nbecome instant believers\u201d) - such a learning experience is clearly a significant \noutcome of the game. Equally, the game encourages the players to question and \nmodify the system rules between iterations \u2013 such that fundamentally different \nproduction rules should be another outcome. Finally, and despite the apparent \nsimplicity of the game, every play evolves slightly differently. The team dynamics will \nvary, initial changes can hinder subsequent, often more fundamental improvements \n(e.g. after initially adding more capacity at bottlenecks, it seems to be more difficult to \nreduce it quickly afterwards \u2013 players often articulate a \u201cwell, we\u201fve added that \ncapacity\/spent that money etc. so we may as well use it\u201d logic) and specific \ninterventions (e.g. changing dot colour) can be made. As a result, another outcome \nof each completed game play will be an increasingly experienced umpire(s) with \nquite often, useful insights into the behaviour of actual managers and systems. \n \nThe above discussion has taken a basic transformation model of a gaming process \nderived from prior definitional work on gaming, and populated the model using a \nspecific example of a short production game, that is consistent in nature with the \nmost popular games (e.g. beer game).  It has shown the role of the different parties, \nthe nature of the sensemaking process that is required, and given clues as to the \nparts of the process that could be automated (e.g. through use of IT support to \nreplace human input) \u2013 though in this case, it is neither necessary nor inherently \ndesirable.  \n \n2.3 Research Questions \n This paper takes these themes forward by asking the research questions: \n 11 \n1. What is the content of OM games?  This is an important question as the nature of \nOM has changed significantly in the recent past, and we need to establish whether \nthe games content has kept pace with this change. \n2. What is the process for the games?  Specifically, their duration, number of people \ninvolved and the level of complexity need to be analysed, along with the physical \nrequirements. \n \nPopulation of the model with a greater range of games in answering the research \nquestions, starts in the following section.  \n \n3. Research Methodology \nIn order to investigate the key research questions, using as many OM teaching and \ntraining games as possible, empirical data is primarily drawn from a catalogue of 572 \ngames derived from three key gaming and simulation publications.  \n \n(A) Graham and Gray (1969) surveyed Fortune 500 training and personnel managers \nand identified different business games2 developed since 1956. \n(B) Elgood (1997) is currently in its 6th edition - making it arguably the most popular \nand enduring gaming text - provides an alphabetical list of games\/simulations3, \ncategorising them according to 70 different disciplinary, functional, relationship \nand skill headings. \n(C) Finally, a recent (2002) on-line catalogue of OM games \n(http:\/\/www.iprod.auc.dk\/x-proj\/gamespm\/www-games.html), developed by a \nEuropean Union funded research group4, is also included. \n \nSuch a secondary data approach has a number of specific advantages and \nlimitations. The game catalogues provide teachers with summary information on \ngames that are available to be disseminated, suggesting that any games included \nhave been successfully applied on a number of occasions. The 222 (41.34% of 572) \ngames classified as OM-related provide a data set that is large enough to improve \nthe external validity of any conclusions. Additionally, the sources provide a basis for \n                                                     \n2 Graham and Gray (1967) describe each game using the following structure: (1) description; (2) training purpose; (3) decisions \nmade by participants\/administrator; (4) administration; (5) source. \n3 Elgood (1997) describes each game using the following structure: (1) principal use(s); (2) background; (3) type of \ngame\/simulation; (4) suitability; (5) acceptable numbers; (6) time requirement; (7) intellectual\/behavioural balance; (8) what \nparticipants will be doing; (9) how the game\/simulation works; (10) in game objectives of participants; (11) knowledge areas \ncovered; (12) behavioural skills\/qualities developed; (13) availability; (14) source. \n4 Created by a Special Interest Group of the IFIP Working Group 5.7 on Integrated Production Management, it was set up to \nstimulate the development and use of games for production management in education and industry. The group holds regular \nworkshops: the proceedings of their 3rd workshop, for instance, have been published (Smeds and Riis 1998). \n 12 \nexploring the evolution of OM gaming over an extended timeframe.

Discussion \nThe number of games identified appears to confirm that there is a long and strong \ntradition of employing games in OM education (Riis 1995). Analysis of the data set is \nstructured around the linear gaming model introduced earlier but unfortunately, \nalthough many of the game descriptions include some discussion of player type \n(practitioner, student, introductory, advanced, etc.), the game data only supports \nmeaningful discussion of process and outcome issues. \n \n4.1. The Content of OM Games \nThe proportion of OM games is not consistent between set A (45.9%) and B (29.1%). \nIt is likely that this is explained by two factors:  B, the later and larger text, has more \nspace and a larger total game population to draw upon, and; it reflects the broader \nshift in management education (1969 to 1997) away from a central pre-occupation \nwith production and production organisations. \n \n4.1.1. General OM Games \nIt was expected that the OM content would be fully integrated into the business \ngames that are not OM specific.  By this, we mean that the effect of functional OM \ndecisions would have the same impact as those of other functional areas.  On the \nsurface, it would appear that this is the case, with almost half of the data set (109, \n49.1%) being made up of general\/whole organisation games that have substantial \nOM-related content. One of the earliest such games, the Harvard Business School \n 13 \nManagement Simulation (McKenney 1962, 1967; McKenney and Dill 1966) for \nexample, allows teams to make \u201c[d]ecisions in all the functional areas of business. In \nthe area of manufacturing teams must purchase and warehouse raw materials, \nschedule production and determine labor utilization\u201d (Graham and Gray 1969, p.210). \nMore recently, a game like Arkea Europe involves players in the manufacture and \nmarketing of a range of related products through a vertically integrated company. Its \nprinciple use is to \u201cincrease management skills related to different functions of a \nbusiness [and] their integration [into] a strategic plan\u201d (Elgood 1997, pp.142-3). \nSimilarly, Bizsim  (Fripp 1993) is a manufacturing industry game whose primary \npurpose is to \u201cincrease understanding of the interrelationship between different \nbusiness functions\u201d (Elgood 1997, p.159). However, closer investigation reveals that \nalthough issues, such as determining total productive capacity, demand planning, \nwork scheduling etc. have a significant influence upon effective game play the OM \nelements have at best, \u201eorder qualifying\u201f effects upon overall performance. Moreover, \nit can be argued that the fundamental teaching themes and the reported key learning \npoints principally relate to generic issues of time-constrained and sequential \ndecision-making, organisational communication, cross-functional integration, co-\nordination of overall strategy, etc. In other words, when compared with many of the \nOM-specific exemplars, the structure of these games is much closer to the generic \ndefinition introduced earlier in the paper.   At the same time, explicit competition \nbetween teams and meaningful profitability rules that can be translated into different \nstrategic options (e.g. not worrying too much about production!) may approximate \n\u201ereal\u201f business motivation but it does not necessarily guarantee that players will learn \nspecific OM lessons.  In pedagogical terms therefore, these games are of \nquestionable use for the OM instructor. \n \n4.1.2.OM Specific Games \nConsidering the content of OM Specific games, it might reasonably be expected that \nthe content has changed over the time covered by the three datasets, to reflect the \nchanges in the nature of the subject that have occurred over this period.   In \nparticular, the move away from considering purely planning and control issues to a \nstrategic view of operations, and from production management to a mix that reflects \nthe increased importance of services.  This change has certainly been reflected in \nthe content of OM courses, when one considers the differences in the texts used e.g. \nStarr (1972) cf. Slack et al (2003), Chase et al, (2003).  However, as shown in Table \n3 this is not the case.  The topics covered by the games are presented in ranked \n 14 \norder, including an analysis of both the overall and the three individual sets of games \nin terms of basic subject areas. \n \n OM CONTENT A B C TOTAL \n1 Manufacturing Production Control (inc. inventory, EOQ, scheduling, MRP) 18 1 12 31 \n2 General Manufacturing and Service Operations 5 7 9 21 \n3 Service Quality (inc. complaint and recovery, customer care, etc.)  11  11 \n4 Logistics\/Supply Chain Management 3 3 4 10 \n5 Capacity\/Demand (inc. strategy, forecasting, investment appraisal) 3 5  8 \n6 Manufacturing Quality Management (inc.

Summary of OM-Specific Game Content \n \nFirstly, one specific health warning should be attached to the analysis: for instance, \nalthough logistics and supply chain related games ranked fourth on the list (10, \n8.85%), at least 4 of these games are variants on the classic \u201ebeer game\u201f developed \nto illustrate the Bull Whip effect (e.g. Lee et al. 1997a,b; Holweg and Bicheno 2002).  \n \nNotwithstanding these reservations, the first two categories together account for 52 \n(46.02%) of the OM-specific games.  The largest group (31, 27.43% of total and \nranked 1 for both A and C) of games explore the value and application of different \nmanufacturing planning and control techniques. Correspondingly, most of these \ngames are based around technical production themes, such as the scheduling of \nmachine capacity, inventory control (EOQ, JIT, MRP), maintenance, workforce and \nwork scheduling, etc. Positively, this suggests that the teaching of specific techniques \nis an important part of OM gaming \u2013 perhaps reflecting a recognition that the main \nchallenge of a technique arises from its practical application (in a complex setting \netc.). At the same time, whilst planning and control is undoubtedly an enduring core \nOM subject area, it is unlikely that any modern curriculum would feature more than a \nsingle game focused exclusively upon the issue. Pragmatically, the popularity of \nthese games is equally likely to reflect the advantages of adapting a quantitative and \nrule-based subject for gaming purposes and the relative ease with which rules can be \nstructured for such a game, compared with something more qualitative, such as \nservice quality.  Moreover, contrary to expectations, the pre-eminence of \n 15 \nmanufacturing planning and control has not lessened over time as much as would be \nexpected \u2013 certainly between A and C.  However, this may be mitigated by observing \nthe other classifications that could be viewed as manufacturing planning and control \n\u2013 specifically categories 4,5 and 8 (logistics\/supply chain, capacity\/demand, JIT).  \nWhen this is taken into account, the figures for the wider view of MPC, are A: 24, \nB:11, and C:17 games.  Thus there is an apparent trend here, but it certainly does \nnot reflect the changed emphasis in the teaching support literature.  The lack of any \nrecent games concerned with International Operations Strategy, for instance, is also \nof concern.   \n \nLastly, the second most common type of game (21, 18.6%) can be classified as \nillustrative of general (predominantly manufacturing) OM practice. These games \nimplicitly address issues of operations strategy (e.g. co-ordinating multiple \nimprovement options) but successful game play (explicit in umpire instructions and \nrules) is always predicated upon an analysis of whatever factors constitute the given \nmarket and competitive context. In other words, the key strategic lessons of these \ngames relate to an \u201eoutside  in\u201f model of strategic fit whereby the strategic role of \noperations is limited to aligning itself with other functions and the external \nmarketplace.  This is undoubtedly suitable for introducing students to the basic \nconcepts of OM, but less useful where for instance experienced practitioners are \nseeking to create genuine class-leading strategies for organisation.    \n \nHaving considered the relationship between the games market and OM teaching \nthemes, the following discussion highlights a meta-observation about the degree to \nwhich OM games reflect OM research priorities. The expectation for this data is not \nas for the teaching themes \u2013 we would not necessarily expect a close correlation \nbetween the gaming themes and research themes per se.  However, it is interesting \nto reflect on any potential links.  As a simple metric, Table 4 compares the count of \ngame content with a similar analysis of published OM research (Pannirselvam et al. \n1999): 15 different research categories5, in order of journal publication frequency, are \nidentified. Acknowledging the limited validity of any conclusions, it remains interesting \nto attempt an approximate matching analysis between the gaming rank and research \nrank for each category. \n                                                     \n5 Project management was an additional category not considered in the game classification. \n 16 \n \nGAMING THEMES  RESEARCH THEMES  PAIRING \n1.

Comparing Rankings of Gaming and Research Content \n \nA simple \u201eeyeball\u201f inspection of the paired rankings suggests that while there is a \nreasonable degree of overall correlation between established research and gaming \npriorities there are also a number of specific, apparently significant, deviations \nbetween the priorities. Some probably reflect the limitations of the data set and the \ncategorisations employed (e.g. many of the general OM games include substantial \nprocess re-design elements) but others may be worth highlighting. For instance, \nService Quality games ranked third (11, 9.73%) on the gaming list, whereas services \nrank 9 on the research list. Although there are still too few service games (e.g. the \nservice quality games are drawn exclusively from set B, there are only 14 service \ngames in the total set and none in set C), OM gaming appears to better reflect shifts \nin management priorities, practice and education than OM research. In other words, \njust as the paucity of service-specific games from the older (and predominantly US-\ncentred) set A is understandable, given the predominance of manufacturing industry \nin business education of that era, an over-emphasis on manufacturing practice is \nincreasingly inappropriate and imbalanced. \n \nWith respect to OM education, there are clearly subject areas where new games \nneed to be developed. For instance, whilst the \u201eoutside  in\u201f model of strategic fit is \nan entirely legitimate and well-established strategic model, it is surprising to find that \nthere are no OM games exploring the conceptually equivalent \u201einside  out\u201f model of \n 17 \nfit (Hayes 1985).  A complementary logic has triggered significant operations strategy \nresearch (Hayes, Wheelwright and Clark 1988, Hayes and Pisano 1996, Bartezzaghi \n1999, Gagnon 1999, Lewis 2000, 2003). Equally, there are also potential examples \nwhere OM game playing could help address a research agenda. Some experimental \ngame-based OM research does exist, for instance in the various forms of \nlearning\/forgetting curve study (Yelle 1979; Globerson, Levin and Shtub 1987; Bailey \n1989; Arzi and Shtub 1997) but the method is not as well established as it is in other \ndisciplines like social psychology (Brief et al. 1995) and economics (Tversky and \nKahneman 1974). \n \n4.2. The Gaming Process \nIn addition to categorising the games according to the intended teaching outcome, \neach game was further analysed against a number of process dimensions \u2013 \nspecifically to see the form of the game (duration and number of players), the level of \ncomplexity, the incorporation of physical processes the role of IT and whether the \ngames were competitive.

Summary of Game Process Details \n 18 \n \nThe specific parameters measured were as follows: mean game duration in days (8 \nhours = 1 day); minimum and maximum number of players6; classification of the \ngame as either simple (defined as comprising fewer than five variables for players to \nmanipulate) or complex; incorporation of \u201ephysical\u201f (e.g. cutting of paper, moving \ncounters on a board) processes; requirement for IT support (including for scoring an \notherwise manual game); competitive or non-competitive (i.e. there may be formal \nevaluation of game play but does a winner emerge) gaming rules. Discussion will be \ncollated under four themes detailing game structure and infrastructure, game \ncomplexity, role of IT, and the role of competition. \n \n4.2.1. Game Structure and Infrastructure \nSome games in the set only required 20 minutes of player participation but most - in \nboth the OM-specific (mean: 3.5 days; mode: 1, max: 10) and OM-related (mean: 1.5 \ndays; mode: 1, max: 5) categories - required extended periods of time to play. The \nlevel of commitment necessary to undertake games that require days of player time \nprobably reflects their origins and application in formal educational settings where the \numpire (e.g. a professor) can mandate participation, indeed several of the longest \nduration games are intended to be used over entire semesters. Across the different \nsets, B has both the shortest specific games (0.05 day) and the lowest average \nduration (mean: 1.6; mode: 0.1, max: 5): this may be explained by the inclusion of \nmore private-sector training and development consultancy-type games. Complexity \nalso relates directly to duration, with the 34 \u201esimple\u201f games having a mean length of \njust 0.34 days (mode: 0.5).7 \n  \nAlthough for both the OM-specific (mean min: 12, mean max: 26) and OM-related \n(mean min: 6, mean max: 36) categories the mean range of players suggests team-\nbased games, the modal player numbers reveal a potentially different picture. For the \ntotal OM-specific set, the modal minimum is 1 player and set C has a modal \nminimum and maximum of 1 player. It can be argued that this emphasis on solitary \ngame play can again be explained by the necessity of teaching specific tools and \ntechniques but unfortunately such a controlled teaching requirement means that \n                                                     \n6 Where the game is team-based a range is given for both minimum and maximum \n7 It is noted that there are often many modes for the execution of a game by an instructor (e.g. number of rounds played, time given for reflection and umpire \nintervention), and so the figures given for individual games are not in any sense exact but just give a notional duration for the purposes of comparison. \n \n 19 \nthese games lack much of the group and organisational behaviour \u201erealism\u201f and \u201efun\u201f \nassociated with whole business games. \n \n4.2.2. Game Complexity \nThe vast majority of both the OM-specific (70.8%) and OM-related games are \nclassified as complex. This seems to reflect a belief that such games are better \nreflections of operational \u201ereality\u201f and therefore more valuable pedagogical devices: in \nparticular (97.25% of OM-related games are complex) where the primary intent is to \nprovide a vehicle for exploring whole system issues.  It is noted that game complexity \nincludes a relatively involved umpire\/facilitator role. Indeed, for a number of the \ngames, multiple umpires are prescribed because of the need to retain control of the \nprocess and the outcomes of the game.  The New Orsiam International Game \ndeveloped by Professor R.H. Muller of the University of Ghent for instance, involves \nbetween 12 and 36 people, simulating 4 to 6 companies playing against each other \nand a \u201cfully automated multi criteria evaluation procedure \u2026 applied to select the \nwinner\u201d (IFIP). A key limitation of the game is described thus: \u201cintense involvement \nand dedication of game co-ordinators is necessary\u201d. Conversely, the level of control \nexerted by the umpire in many of the complex OM-related games is deliberately \nminimal \u2013 despite the game being played to a complex set of rules. The purpose of \nthese game appears to be to allow players to \u201efigure it out\u201f for themselves.  The \nfigures are distinctly different between the OM specific and the OM related sets and \nthere does appear to be a trend towards more complex games in the OM specific set.   \n \nThis strong bias towards complex games requiring extensive umpire \nsupport\/intervention seems to reflect the dominant logic of current OM game design. \nThe true value, both conceptually and practically, of such complexity has to be \nquestioned however. It is important to establish if this tendency is akin to that \nidentified within OM research of seeking to develop \u201cmore complex models [that] we \npresume are more realistic, since they take into account more variables\u201d but which \nsome authors view as having taken the discipline away from \u201cdealing with the \nbroader managerial implications of decisions in production systems\u201d (Buffa 1982). \nThere seems to be an implicit assumption, but no clear supporting evidence, that \nexperienced managers accept game formats that replicate more closely their actual \nwork environment \u2013 indeed the converse could actually be true. Similarly, it is not \nclear whether there is a push or a pull relationship between the ubiquitous IT \nsophistication and gaming complexity. At a recent conference (EurOMA\/POMS 2003) \nfor instance, the author attended a session where UK and US participants discussed \n 20 \nthe use of mass market computer games - such as Theme Park and Theme Hospital \n- in teaching.  In particular, the discussion questioned the usefulness of highly \ncomplex games, and demonstrated instructors\u201f preferences for short, easy-to-run \nscenarios that could easily be integrated, say into a 2 or 3-hour lecture slot. \n \n \n4.2.3 Incorporation of physical processes \nExperience with OM games suggests that wherever possible, some physical process \nhelps with establishing a connection with the gaming environment for players. It was \nsurprising therefore, to note that of the OM specific games there was little use of \nphysical processes in dataset A, and still less that half of the games involving \nphysical processes in the more recent datasets.  This is at odds with the finding that \nmuch of the gaming content was concerned with manufacturing and physical product \nissues (including logistics and inventory management).   \n \nIn the OM related games, the levels of physical processes were even less, with only \n11.11% of dataset B including physical processes.  This is consistent with the earlier \nfinding noted as \u201edon\u201ft worry about production\u201f in the OM related games.  Whilst it is \nclearly easier for an instructor if physical issues of a game can be discounted (one \nless thing to organise) such artefacts were an intrinsic part of our earlier \ntransformation model.  It is clear that the typical OM game does not involve the \ntransformation of such artefacts; rather information is transformed in the majority of \ngames.   \n \n4.2.4 Role of IT in games \nThe first point of note is how the earliest data set from 1969 contained a substantial \nproportion of games that required IT support (57.89% of OM specific, 69.57 of OM \nrelated).  Clearly, this will have changed in nature over the three surveys, but here is \nevidence of an appetite in the providers to claim intellectual property through the \ndevelopment of proprietary IT elements of the games.  Overall, the majority of all OM \ngames require some degree of IT support (57.72% of OM specific, 80.74% of OM \nrelated). More specifically, many of the recent games (B and C) were entirely PC-\nbased or needed a computer simulation to provide the gaming context and evaluate \nperformance (i.e. interpret rule-based outcomes). For example, the FMS Design \nGame (IFIP) requires a PC Windows environment, Excel spreadsheet, FORTRAN \nqueue theory modules and the Witness simulation package. This emphasis on using \ninfrastructure to deal with complexity and increase gaming realism appears to be \n 21 \nextremely significant for OM. Arguably, this trend reaches its natural conclusion in \nfacilities such as the electronics industry training factory at the University of Oulu, \nFinland (Haapasolo and Hyv\u00f6nen 2001, p.265). This provides a networked learning \nenvironment and a complete facsimile of a factory layout (complete with integrated \nmanufacturing technologies on different floors) to support its \u201efast-cycle\u201f production \nsimulation.  However, consistent with the transformation model proposed in Fig. 1, \nthere is only so much of teaching games that can be automated, and indeed, it is \nnotable that there are still a significant number of games in samples B and C that are \nnot IT-centric nor require IT support.  This may be consistent with the level of \ncomplexity and duration \u2013 shorter, less complex games requiring less processing of \ndata.   \n \n \n4.2.5. Role of Competition \nCompetition in the context of OM games is considered to arise where there is a \nbenchmark for players to measure their performance against.  This benchmark may \nbe generated dynamically by other players in the same game, or by some notion of \noptimality provided by the gaming system. The authors experience would lead them \nto a hypothesis that competition in either of these forms is a desirable feature of \ngames and that this would be a consistent feature of OM specific games.  Where \nthere is such an obvious immediate reward mechanism (beyond possible course \ncredits for players) we have observed enormous levels of commitment to the spirit as \nwell as the content of games, that has been most enlightening for all involved.  The \npositive aspects of competition have introduced more fundamental questions of \nrealism than any amount of additional rules could have done. There are however \nthree adverse effects of competition that we have noted.  The first is the \u201ewe quit\u2019 \nteam \u2013 where a group falls behind its competitors, and decides that it is not worth \ncontinuing with a high level of effort to try to catch up.  The second is where a team \n\u201ewins\u201f or performs  at a high level in comparison with the other teams, but this then \nmasks the insights that they might have gained, because they lose the ability to be \nable to conceive that they could have made changes that would have allowed them \nto perform even better.  Thirdly, despite some limited discussion of player \n\u201eappropriateness\u201f, the descriptions included in the data set suggest that there has \nbeen insufficient reflection upon the impact of key player variables (e.g. player work \nand gaming experience, educational and managerial level). This could be particularly \nsignificant where, for instance, the players are ambitious employees or senior \nmanagers and already apprehensive about being peer-evaluated (Weick 1977, \n 22 \np.124). Add in a competitive game process, especially one linked with deliberately \ncontrived situational confusion and this player\/game type combination could make it \nvery difficult for them to (at least initially) engage with the game play.   \n \nUsing competitive game playing may not be the most appropriate for all students, but \nthe exceptions noted have been rare.  We argue that on balance it is desirable that \nthere is an explicit motivation central to the logic of the game, and competition is one \nmeans to generate this. However, the datasets show that only 30.97% of the OM-\nspecific and 60.55% of the OM-related games involve the explicit use of competitive \ndynamics.  Moreover, there is a clear change in the incidence of competition in the \ndatasets \u2013 declining from 71.05% in set A, to only 5.71% in set C.  The reasoning \nbehind this might include the nature of the gaming \u2013 where current product offerings \ngive the opportunity for a different type of play.  We constructed this as \nexperimentation, rather than competition earlier in the paper.   For instance, one of \nset A games is the Production Scheduling Management Game.  This is described as \na \u201cnon-competitive production control game\u201d. It requires players to \u201cschedule jobs on \nthree machines in a production department \u2026.. [players] must decide which jobs to \naccept and the exact production schedule.\u201d The sole purpose of the game is to \nillustrate the benefits of \u201csystematic procedures\u201d (Graham and Gray 1969, p. 346). \nWe would classify this game as giving the possibility for active experimentation, \nrather than explicit competition. \n \n5. Concluding Comments \nThe development of games has been the focus of practitioner and academic interest \nfor more than fifty years and this review has attempted to summarise some of the \nbreadth and depth of gaming practice in OM education.  This was prompted by the \nauthors\u201f own extensive and very positive experience with using games as a core part \nof OM courses.  Two areas of interest were identified for this paper.  The first was to \nconsider the content of OM games.  The second was to consider the process.  The \nwhole discussion was framed by a transformation model of gaming, which allowed \nthe process of playing the game to be analysed. \n \nThe market offering for games was based on a database of 222 games collated from \nthree secondary sources.  The games were divided into those that were OM specific \nand OM relevant.  The OM specific games were further analysed to determine their \nnature and usefulness in teaching OM.  The conclusion was drawn that although OM \nissues were present in many of the OM relevant games, the content was such that \n 23 \nthe role of OM was not given sufficient prominence to be classified as anything more \nthan introductory.  This was contrary to expectations \u2013 we had expected the gaming \nmarket to have progressed in a manner consistent with the development of OM in \nboth theory and practice.  Similarly in the market for OM specific games, it was noted \nthat there is a preponderance of quantitative manufacturing-oriented games, against \na trend to more qualitative service-based subjects in OM content.  When compared \nwith the concerns of OM publications, the levels of occurrence of particular topics \nhad some similarity, yet the preponderance of an \u201eoutside-in\u201f view of strategy was \nnoted.  However, it was noted that the games were a better representation of the \ncurrent industrial context than the incidence of published research.   \n \nIn further examining the nature of the games, it became clear that there was a \npreponderance of highly complex games, with a significant role for the umpire.  In \nterms of educational utility, this was questioned, as the abstracted reality was being \nmade complex as a surrogate for being close to reality.  In addition, it does need to \nbe considered if these are indeed what instructors need or whether the development \nof less complex, short scenarios would be pedagogically beneficial. \n \nIn considering the role of IT in the games, there is a long tradition of IT being used in \nthe support of games.  We note that this support has changed over time, with the \ngames from the early data set using IT as number-processing support, whereas \ntoday such support would be fairly trivial, compared to the dynamic mulit-media \npossibilities that exist.  Despite concerns that all games would require IT interaction, \nthere is still a significant number of games that require little or no IT input.   \n  \nThe numbers of competitive games on offer to the OM educator has decreased \nsignificantly over the past 35 years.  This is not completely explained by the data nor \nby the experience of running competitive games by the authors.  This does inform the \ndebate on the definition of game (e.g. McKenny, 1967) and shows that \u201eplay as \nexperimentation\u201f is now the predominant mode of gaming. \n \n6. Further Work \nThe analytical findings and conclusions presented in this paper also highlight many \nareas that warrant further work. It is proposed that the following two areas merit \nparticular attention. \n \n 24 \n1. Many of the themes highlighted in this critical review clearly relate to design \ndecisions but the data set of \u201efinished\u201f games does not permit direct analysis of \nthe new game design (NGD) process. Therefore, a future study could usefully \nanalyse a smaller set of games in more detail, seek to identify common \ncomponents (c.f. product platforms, design modularity) and develop some kind of \ndesign typology, for instance. Moreover, those authors who have discussed the \nNGD process (Gibbs 1974, Hitchcock 1988, Fripp 1993) have largely positioned \nit as a rational knowledge generation approach akin to the conceptualisation, \nmodelling, model solving and, implementation research cycle. Given the state of \nknowledge about new product and service development (e.g. Brown and \nEisenhardt 1995) however, such a simplistic model needs refining to include \npotential trade-offs: for example, to \u201eteach\u201f specific content, how a game needs \nto be controlled so that \u201eevents of interest\u201f actually occur yet this may run counter \nto fair game playing.  The challenges posed by having a highly diverse group of \nplayers (e.g. levels of experience), the role of physical artefacts and the issue of \ncompetition and strategy development (outside in vs. inside out) in OM gaming \nclearly need to be better understood.  \n2. Close examination of the data set reveals how challenging it is to describe a \ndynamic social phenomenon like a game. There is clearly a need to consider \nalternative game reporting and sharing mechanisms between instructors (e.g. a \ngame clearing house, as exists for case material).  This needs to be supported \nby some form of empirical investigation into actual usage of the games, \ntriangulating umpire, player and third party observer feedback. This quasi-\nresearch approach, taking advantage of modern AV technology (a digital video \ncollection of games being played) would offer a much richer insight into the \nadvantages and disadvantages of different types of game inputs, processes and \noutcomes.  This paper has provided a foundation for such work. \n \nReferences \n1. Allen, T.B. (1987).
