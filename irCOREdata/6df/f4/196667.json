To ensure that each gamete inherits\nan entire complement of chromosomes, organisms employ an\narray of different mechanisms, all of which rely on partner\nrecognition followed by their separation (\u2018segregation\u2019) at the first\nmeiotic division.\nMany, but not all, organisms depend upon the formation of\nchiasmata between the segregating partners, termed homologous\nchromosomes (homologs) [1]. Chiasmata have been proposed to\ncounteract the pulling forces that are generated when kinetochores\nattach to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles,\nthereby facilitating the inactivation of the spindle assembly\ncheckpoint once homologs are bioriented [2,3].\nIn budding yeast, the precursors to chiasmata, crossovers, are\npromoted by the Synapsis Initiation Complex (SIC) proteins, also\ntermed the ZMM ensemble (Zip3\/Zip1\/Zip2-Zip4-Spo16, Msh4-\nMsh5, andMer3). Crossovers are generated from a subset of meiotic\nrecombination events and are preceeded by specific double-strand\nbreak repair intermediates, including single-end invasions [4] and\njoint molecules\/double Holliday Junctions [5,6,7].\nHolliday Junctions are substrates of the mismatch-repair paralogues,\nMsh4 and Msh5 [8]. Msh4 and Msh5 function as a heterodimer\nduring meiosis [9] and do not contain the mismatch-repair binding\ndomain found in other MutS paralogues [10,11]. Consistent with this,\nthe absence of MSH4 or MSH5 influences neither mitotic post-\nreplicative mismatch repair nor meiotic heteroduplex DNA repair,\nsince no significant appearance of post-meiotic segregation events are\nobserved [12,13]. Furthermore, the human MSH4-MSH5 heterodi-\nmer does not show a preference for mismatch-containing heteroduplex\nDNA over homoduplex DNA [8].\nMsh4-Msh5 may promote crossing over by protecting cross-\nover-specific intermediates from being resolved as noncrossovers,\nfor example by Sgs1\/BLM [14,15]. In turn, formation of Msh4-\nMsh5 foci on meiotic chromosomes depends upon synaptonemal\ncomplex proteins, including Zip3 and Zip1.\nIn the absence of any one of the zmm genes, crossover\nfrequencies are reduced, but not abolished [16]. The decreased\nlevels of crossovers are generally thought to cause increased levels\nof homolog missegregation, resulting in decreased viability of\ngametes, known as spores in budding yeast. Several observations\nsupport the notion that the decreased spore viability is due to\nincreased missegregation of homologous chromosomes. First,\nwhen assessed genetically, many of the mutants display increased\nnon-disjunction of homologous chromosomes (reviewed in [17]).\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 10 | e7284\nSecond, partial restoration of crossover levels in zmm mutants by\nmutation of SGS1\/BLM helicase improves segregation and spore\nviability [14,15]. Third, spore viability is decreased when\nprecursors to crossovers, double-strand breaks, are decreased by\nmutation of Spo11, a topoisomerase II-type protein that catalyzes\nthe DSBs [18]. Fourth, the zmm mutants analysed show an\nincrease in the formation of non-exchange chromosomes,\nparticular of smaller chromosomes [19,20]. This, together with\nthe observation that artificial or sequence-diverged (homeologous)\nnon-exchange chromosome \u2018pairs\u2019 in budding yeast missegregate\n,10\u201320% of meioses (compared to ,1% for exchange pairs in\nwild-type cells) indicate that the generation and subsequent\nmissegregation of non-exchange chromosome pairs contribute to\nspore death [21,22,23,24].\nHere, we have identified temperature as a modulator of\nchromosome segregation in msh4 and msh5 mutant strains. We\nshow that this occurs in different budding yeast strains, without\nany apparent concomitant increase in crossover levels. We identify\nSpo11 and Zip1 as important factors for this phenotype.\nResults\nTemperature modulates spore viability in msh4 and msh5\nmutants\nzmm mutants show decreased levels of crossovers at both 23 and\n33uC, with a more severe defect at 33uC [16]. Nevertheless, msh4\nand msh5 mutants showed improved gamete viability at 33uC\n(Figure 1A and B). This was not the case for the remaining zmm\nmutants (Tables 1 and 2). At 23uC, all of the zmm mutant strains\nshowed the characteristic increase in the two- and zero-viable spore\nclasses, consistent with meiosis I non-disjunction (Table 1). The Y55\nmsh5 and the msh4 msh5mutants displayed a more severe decrease in\nthe proportion of four-viable spored tetrads compared to the msh4\nstrain at this lower temperature. Since Msh5 has previously been\nsuggested to be important for chromosome segregation in crossover-\ndefective mms4 mlh1 strains [25], it is possible that Msh5 has a role\nindependently of Msh4. If so, this is strain-specific as no differences\nin gamete viability between the msh4 and msh5 strains was observed\nin SK1 (Table 2). Regardless of this, the temperature-dependent\nFigure 1.

Thus, our data suggest two temperature-dependent\nprocesses: Msh5may have a strain-specific chromosome segregation\nfunction at 23uC, whereas elevated temperature (33uC) positively\nimpacts chromosome segregation in the absence of Msh4 or Msh5.\nWe focus on the latter phenotype.\nTo verify that the improved spore viability at 33uC was due to\nimproved chromosome segregation, we assessed the segregation of\nchromosome III in tetrads.

In contrast, a meiosis I non-disjunction event\nwill generate an ascus where two of the spores contain two GFP\nsignals and two spores lack GFP altogether. In all of the three\nstrains, meiosis I non-disjunction frequencies were decreased ,3-\nfold at 33uC compared to 23uC (Figure 1C). Thus, improved\nchromosome segregation is the most likely explanation for the\nenhanced spore viability in the msh4 and msh5 strains at 33uC.\nCrossover frequencies are not increased on chromosome\nIII\nmsh4 mutants are defective in crossing over [12,16,26].\nTherefore, we considered whether crossover formation was\ndifferent at 33uC in the msh4 mutant. Classical genetic analysis\nof crossing over on chromosome III (Figure 1D) in the four-viable\nspored tetrads revealed similar crossover levels in the msh4 mutant\nat 23uC and 33uC (Table 3). These observations suggest that total\nlevels of crossovers within the population of viable spores are\nunaffected by temperature in the msh4 mutant.\nA non-exchange homeologous chromosome III pair\ndisplays improved chromosome segregation at 33uC\ncompared with 23uC in the absence of MSH4\nTo determine unambiguously that msh4 mutants have improved\nchromosome segregation independently of enhanced crossover\nfrequencies, we assessed the segregation of a homeologous\nchromosome pair. In this diploid strain of Y55, one of the\nchromosome IIIs had been replaced by the co-linear chromosome\nfrom the sibling species, S. paradoxus. The resulting sequence\ndivergence (10\u201320%) [27,28] suppresses crossing over in ,90% of\nwild-type meioses [24]. We failed to observe a single crossover in\nthe LEU2-MAT interval in the inspected tetrads at 23uC or 33uC\nin the msh4 strain (data not shown), suggesting that crossing over is\nnot increased. The homeologous chromosome pair missegregates\nin 7.3% and 1.7% of meioses at 23uC and at 33uC respectively\n(Table 4). These observations support the hypothesis that\ntemperature regulates segregation independently of modulating\ncrossover levels on chromosome III.\nIt is unclear whether temperature improves the segregation of\nthe homeologous chromosome pairs in the presence of MSH4,\nsince the homeolog pair did not display any detectable\ntemperature-dependent decrease in its non-disjunction frequency\nat 33uC. In the wild-type strain, the homeolog pair missegregated\nin 8.2% of meioses at 23uC, similar to previous observations [24],\nand 6.9% at 33uC (Table 4). These observations raise the\npossibility that the temperature-dependent modulation of chro-\nmosome segregation might be specific to msh4 mutants.\nA defect in meiotic progression does not select for\nimproved viability amongst successfully sporulated cells\nProgression to meiosis I in zmm mutants in the SK1\nbackground is more severely abrogated at 33uC than at 23uC.\nThis is accompanied by a more severe defect in crossing over at\nthe HIS4LEU2 hotspot at 33uC (15% of wild type) compared to\nTable 3.

Nevertheless, both the msh4 and\nmsh5 mutants in SK1 displayed relatively good viability,\nparticularly at 33uC (Table 2). It is therefore possible that\npreferential progression of the meiotic cells with relatively high\naccuracy of chromosome segregation may be selected. Although\nthis could explain the phenotype in SK1, in Y55 and BR,\nsporulation frequencies were similar at the two temperatures in\nthe msh4 strains (.45%, Table 1 and data not shown).\nImportantly, further decreasing the sporulation frequency of\nmsh4 in Y55 by increasing temperature to 37 or 39uC, does not\ninfluence viability or crossover frequencies (Tables 1 and 3).\nDeletion of ZIP1 reduces spore viability of the msh4\nmutant at 33uC to levels observed at 23uC\nHomolog pairing was also not affected by temperature. Using\nfluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes against\nchromosome III as well as V in the msh4 mutant (EY137), we\nobserved homolog pairing frequencies that were similarly high at\nboth 23 and 33uC (.95%, data not shown), consistent with\nprevious observations that deletion of MSH4 or MSH5 does not\ninfluence the juxtapositioning required for recombination in the\nSpo11-independent Cre\/Lox system [29]. Nevertheless, homolog\nrecognition mediated by meiotic recombination is presumably still\nrequired for the improved segregation in msh4 since spo11 msh4\ndouble mutants displayed ,2% spore viability (irrespective of\ntemperature), similar to a spo11 mutant (Table 5).\nFinally, since other zmmmutants did not display the improvement\nin chromosome segregation at 33uC, we carried out epistasis\nanalysis. ZIP1, which encodes the transverse element of the\nsynaptonemal complex, is required for the temperature-mediated\nimprovement in chromosome segregation (Table 5). The msh4 zip1\nmutant displayed similar spore viabilities at 23 and 33uC.\nDiscussion\nThe zmm mutants have similar defects in crossover frequencies,\nhowever, msh4 and msh5 display improved chromosome segrega-\ntion at 33uC. At least two observations suggest that temperature\nmodulates chromosome segregation independently of increasing\ncrossover frequencies. First, crossover frequencies on chromosome\nIII were similar at 23 and 33uC (Table 3). Second, missegregation\nof the non-exchange homeolog chromosome pair was also\nimproved at 33uC in msh4 cells.\nAlthough crossover frequencies are important, another consid-\neration is the crossover position relative to the centromere, since\ncentromere distal crossovers are less likely to facilitate biorienta-\ntion of homologs, at least in mad2 mutants of budding yeast [30].\nIn our dataset, crossovers falling within the LEU2-MAT interval\nthat spans CEN3 (220 kb to +100 kb) were similar at 33uC and\n23uC (Table 3), suggesting that crossovers were not being\nredistributed to the centromeric region at 33uC thereby promoting\nsegregation.\nThe enhanced segregation at 33uC depends upon Spo11, since\ndeleting SPO11 in the msh4 strains caused spore viability to mimic\nthose observed in a spo11 strain (Table 5). Therefore, some aspect\nof recombination is presumably required for chromosome\nsegregation in the msh4 strain.\nMoreover, another ZMM protein, Zip1, is important for the\ntemperature-mediated chromosome segregation phenotype. Al-\nthough a previous study failed to observe an effect of deleting ZIP1\naffecting the segregation of a non-exchange homeologous\nchromosome pair [31], Zip1 might be important for chromosome\nsegregation of homologous chromosomes that fail to crossover.\nMechanisms that aid the segregation of non-exchange chromo-\nsome pairs (also originally referred to as distributive segregation) in\nS. cerevisiae are well-documented [21,30,32]. One hypothesis would\nbe that homolog recognition, which depends upon Spo11-\ndependent recombination (noncrossover or even crossover), is\nfollowed by a Zip1-mediated segregation mechanism that occurs\nindependent of its function in crossing over. Another possibility is\nthat different recombination intermediates- that might support\nchromosome segregation- could be formed in the msh4 mutant\ncompared to the zip1 mutant. Differences in the recombination\nphenotypes of zmm mutants have been reported [14,16].\nFinally, we note that at 23uC, the zmm mutants, including msh4\nand msh5, display similar reductions in spore viability. Thus,\nwhichever mechanism(s) promotes chromosome segregation in the\nmsh4 strain, it requires and responds to elevated temperature\n(33uC).\nMaterials and Methods\nYeast genetics and sporulation conditions\nAll strains are listed in Supplementary Table S1 and were\nverified by PCR and\/or Southern blot as well as meiotic\nsegregation.
