We illustrate the method by computing the next-\nto-leading order line shape of a scalar resonance in an abelian gauge-Yukawa model.\nPACS numbers: 11.15.Bt, 11.80.Cr\nHigher-order calculations for processes involving mas-\nsive, unstable particles close to resonance suffer from the\nbreakdown of ordinary perturbation theory, since the in-\ntermediate propagator becomes singular. This singular-\nity is avoided if the finite width, \u0393, of the unstable parti-\ncle is taken into account in the construction of the prop-\nagator via resummation of self-energy insertions. There\nare a number of approaches along this line to avoid the\nproblem [1]. However, so far there is no method that\nallows to systematically improve the accuracy of calcula-\ntions order by order in perturbation theory. The purpose\nof this letter is to present such a method.\nWe are concerned with processes involving an unstable\nparticle close to resonance. The main idea is to exploit\nthe hierarchy of scales \u0393\u226aM , whereM is the pole mass,\nin order to systematically organize the calculations in a\nseries in the coupling, \u03b1, and \u0393\/M . While the expan-\nsion in \u03b1 is standard, we construct an effective theory\nto perform the expansion in \u0393\/M . A first step in this\ndirection has been presented in [2]. The main idea of\nour approach is similar to non-relativistic QCD, where\nan expansion in \u03b1 and the velocity of the heavy quarks is\nmade. We will identify all relevant modes and use them\nto write the operators of the Lagrangian of the effective\ntheory. This Lagrangian is then matched to the underly-\ning theory, using the method of regions [3]. In this letter\nwe will outline the basic idea and we refer to [4] for more\ndetails.\nWe consider a toy model that involves a massive scalar\nfield, \u03c6, and two fermion fields. The scalar as well as\none of the fermion fields, \u03c8, (the \u201celectron\u201d) are charged\nunder an abelian gauge symmetry, whereas the other\nfermion, \u03c7, (the \u201cneutrino\u201d) is neutral. The model al-\nlows for the scalar to decay into an electron-neutrino pair\nthrough a Yukawa interaction. The Lagrangian is\nL = (D\u00b5\u03c6)\u2020D\u00b5\u03c6\u2212 M\u02c62\u03c6\u2020\u03c6+ \u03c8\u00afi 6D\u03c8 + \u03c7\u00afi6\u2202\u03c7\n\u2212 1\n4\nF\u00b5\u03bdF\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 1\n2\u03be\n(\u2202\u00b5A\n\u00b5)2\n+ y\u03c6\u03c8\u00af\u03c7+ y\u2217\u03c6\u2020\u03c7\u00af\u03c8 \u2212 \u03bb\n4\n(\u03c6\u2020\u03c6)2 + Lct , (1)\nwhere M\u02c6 and Lct denote the renormalized mass and the\ncounterterm Lagrangian and D = \u2202 \u2212 igA. We define\n\u03b1g \u2261 g2\/(4\u03c0), \u03b1y \u2261 (yy\u2217)\/(4\u03c0) (at the scale \u00b5) and\nassume \u03b1g \u223c \u03b1y \u223c \u03b1, and \u03b1\u03bb \u2261 \u03bb\/(4\u03c0) \u223c \u03b12\/(4\u03c0).\nWe would like to obtain the totally inclusive cross sec-\ntion for the process\n\u03bd\u00af(q) + e\u2212(p)\u2192 X (2)\nas a function of s \u2261 (p + q)2 by calculating the forward\nscattering amplitude T (s) and taking its imaginary part.\n(The total cross section of process (2) has an initial state\ncollinear singularity which has to be absorbed into the\nelectron distribution function. In what follows it is un-\nderstood that this singularity is subtracted minimally.)\nIn particular, we are interested in the region s \u2248 M2,\nor more precisely s \u2212 M2 \u223c M\u0393 \u223c \u03b1M2 \u226a M2. In\nthis kinematic region the cross section is enhanced due\nto the propagator of the scalar. Furthermore, at each\norder in \u03b1 we get additional contributions proportional\nto \u03b1M\u02c62\/(s\u2212 M\u02c62) \u223c 1 due to self-energy insertions.\nWe now turn to the main part of this letter and dis-\ncuss how to construct the effective theory. Our approach\nis based on the hierarchy of scales \u0393 \u226a M . Thus, we\nsystematically expand the cross section in powers of \u03b1\nand\n\u03b4 \u2261 s\u2212 M\u02c6\n2\nM\u02c62\n\u223c \u0393\nM\n. (3)\nIn a theory that formulates this expansion correctly,\nother issues like resummation of self-energy insertions\nand gauge invariance are taken care of automatically.\nIn a first step we integrate out hard momenta k \u223c M .\nThe effective theory will then not contain any longer dy-\nnamical hard modes since their effect is included in the\ncoefficients of the operators. The hard effects are associ-\nated with what is usually called factorizable corrections,\nwhereas the effects of the dynamical modes correspond\nto the non-factorizable corrections [2]. On the level of\nFeynman diagrams, this amounts to using the method of\nregions to separate loop integrals into various contribu-\ntions [3]. The hard part is obtained by expanding the\nintegrand in \u03b4. The difference between the full integral\n2and its hard part has to be reproduced by modes cor-\nresponding to momentum configurations that are near\nmass-shell. The main task is to identify these modes,\nand to write the operators of the effective Lagrangian\nin terms of the corresponding field operators and then\nto compute the coefficients of the operators by matching\n(up to a certain order in \u03b1 and \u03b4).\nOur goal is to carry out this programme for our model\nto an order in \u03b1 and \u03b4 that is sufficient to compute\nT (0) + T (1), the forward scattering amplitude at next-\nto-leading order (NLO), where T (0) sums up all terms\nthat scale as (\u03b1\/\u03b4)n \u223c 1 and T (1) contains all terms that\nare suppressed by an additional power of \u03b1 or \u03b4.\nThe basic process under consideration is the following:\nwe start with highly energetic fermions, produce a near\nmass-shell scalar which then decays again into highly en-\nergetic fermions. Accordingly we split the effective La-\ngrangian into three parts. Roughly speaking, the first,\nLHSET, describes the heavy scalar field near mass-shell\nand its interaction with the gauge field. The second part,\nLSCET, describes energetic (charged) fermions and their\ninteractions with the gauge field. Finally, the third part,\nLint, describes the external fermions and how they inter-\nact to produce the final state. We will discuss these three\nparts in turn.\nThe construction of LHSET follows closely the construc-\ntion of the effective Lagrangian for heavy quark effec-\ntive theory (HQET) [5]. We write the momentum of the\nscalar particle near resonance as P = M\u02c6v+ k, where the\nvelocity vector v satisfies v2 = 1 and the residual mo-\nmentum k scales as M\u03b4. We will call such a scalar field\na \u201csoft\u201d field (in [2] the term \u201cresonant\u201d has been used).\nThus, for a soft scalar field we have P 2 \u2212 M\u02c62 \u223cM\u03b4 and\nthis remains true if the scalar particle interacts with a soft\ngauge boson with momentum M\u03b4. In analogy to HQET\nwe remove the rapid spatial variation e\u2212iM\u02c6v\u00b7x from the\n\u03c6-field and define\n\u03c6v(x) \u2261 eiM\u02c6v\u00b7x P+\u03c6(x) , (4)\nwhere P+ projects onto the positive frequency part to\nensure that \u03c6v is a pure destruction field. We now write\nthe effective Lagrangian in terms of \u03c6v and construct the\nbilinear terms so as to reproduce the two-point function\nclose to resonance. Denoting the complex pole of the\npropagator by s\u00af and the residue at the pole by R\u03c6 the\npropagator can be written as\ni R\u03c6\nP 2 \u2212 s\u00af =\ni R\u03c6\n2M\u02c6vk + k2 \u2212 (s\u00af\u2212 M\u02c62) . (5)\nWe define the matching coefficient\n\u2206 \u2261 s\u00af\u2212 M\u02c6\n2\nM\u02c6\n(6)\nand a\u00b5\u22a4 \u2261 a\u00b5 \u2212 (va) v\u00b5 for any vector. There are two\nsolutions to P 2 = s\u00af, one of which is irrelevant since it\nscales as vk \u223c M\u02c6 . For the other we find\nvk = \u2212M\u02c6 +\n\u221a\nM\u02c62 + M\u02c6\u2206\u2212 k2\u22a4\n=\n\u2206\n2\n\u2212 \u2206\n2 + 4k2\u22a4\n8M\u02c6\n+O(\u03b43), (7)\nwhere we expanded in \u03b4 in the second line. Therefore,\nthe bilinear terms are given by\nL\u03c6\u03c6 = 2M\u02c6\u03c6\u2020v\n(\niv \u00b7Ds \u2212 \u2206\n2\n)\n\u03c6v\n+ 2M\u02c6\u03c6\u2020v\n(\n(iDs\u22a4)\n2\n2M\u02c6\n+\n\u22062\n8M\u02c6\n)\n\u03c6v + . . . , (8)\nwhere Ds \u2261 \u2202 \u2212 igAs denotes the soft covariant deriva-\ntive. In obtaining L\u03c6\u03c6 we exploited the fact that the\ngauge invariance of the full Lagrangian is not broken by\nthe separation into hard and soft parts. Therefore, the ef-\nfective Lagrangianmust be gauge invariant as well and we\ncan obtain the interaction of the scalar with the soft pho-\nton simply by replacing \u2202 \u2192 Ds. The gauge invariance of\n\u2206 follows from the gauge invariance of s\u00af and M\u02c6 . Further-\nmore, \u2206 is given entirely by hard contributions, which\njustifies its interpretation as matching coefficient. Using\n(6) we can express it in terms of the hard part of the self-\nenergy \u03a0h(s). Writing \u03a0h(s) = M\u02c6\n2\n\u2211\nk,l \u03b4\nl\u03a0(k,l), where\nit is understood that \u03a0(k,l) \u223c \u03b1k, we obtain\n\u2206 \u2261\n\u2211\ni\n\u2206(i) = (9)\nM\u02c6 \u03a0(1,0) + M\u02c6\n(\n\u03a0(2,0) + \u03a0(1,1)\u03a0(1,0)\n)\n+ . . .\nExplicit results for \u2206(1) and \u2206(2) in the MS and pole\nrenormalization scheme can be found in [4]. Here we\nonly note that in the pole scheme s\u00af \u2261 M2 \u2212 iM\u0393, so\n\u2206 = \u2212i\u0393 when M\u02c6 = M . Inserting the expansion (9)\ninto (8) and supplementing L\u03c6\u03c6 with the kinetic terms\nfor soft photons and fermions we obtain\nLHSET = 2M\u02c6\u03c6\u2020v\n(\niv \u00b7Ds \u2212 \u2206\n(1)\n2\n)\n\u03c6v\n+ 2M\u02c6\u03c6\u2020v\n(\n(iDs,\u22a4)\n2\n2M\u02c6\n+\n[\u2206(1)]2\n8M\u02c6\n\u2212 \u2206\n(2)\n2\n)\n\u03c6v\n\u2212 1\n4\nFs\u00b5\u03bdF\n\u00b5\u03bd\ns + \u03c8\u00afsi 6Ds\u03c8s + \u03c7\u00afsi 6\u2202\u03c7s. (10)\nEach term in LHSET can be assigned a scaling power in \u03b4.\nIn momentum space the propagator of the \u03c6v field scales\nas 1\/\u03b4. Hence, because\n\u222b\nd4k counts as \u03b44, the soft scalar\nfield \u03c6v(x) scales as \u03b4\n3\/2. Since \u2206(1) \u223c Ds \u223c M\u03b4, both\nterms in the first line of (8) scale as \u03b44 and are leading\nterms. The terms in the second line are suppressed by\none power in \u03b4 or \u03b1. Finally, since A\u00b5s scales as \u03b4 and the\nsoft fermion fields scale as \u03b43\/2 (see [7]) the terms in the\nlast line of (8) scale as \u03b44. In (8) we have left out terms\n3further suppressed in \u03b4 or \u03b1. As we will see, they are\nnot needed for the calculation of the line shape at NLO.\nHowever, we stress that the expansion can be performed\nto whatever accuracy is needed.\nWe note that computing the scalar propagator to all\norders in \u03b4 using LHSET does not reproduce (5). Instead\nnear resonance we obtain i\u031f\u22121Reff\u03c6\/(P\n2 \u2212 s\u00af), where\n\u031f\u22121 \u2261 (M\u02c62+M\u02c6\u2206\u2212k2\u22a4)1\/2\/M\u02c6 = 1+O(\u03b4, \u03b1). The differ-\nence in the normalization is taken into account in match-\ning calculations by an additional wave-function normal-\nization factor \u031f\u22121\/2 for each external \u03c6v-line in the ef-\nfective theory.\nNext, we turn to the construction of the effective La-\ngrangian, LSCET, associated with the energetic fermions.\nWe need a \u201ccollinear\u201d mode to describe a fermion with\nlarge momentum in the say ~n\u2212 direction. Such modes\nhave been discussed previously within the context of soft-\ncollinear effective theory (SCET) [6]. The Lagrangian\nhas been worked out to order \u03b4 in [7] and we can take\nthe parts relevant to us from there. (What we call \u201csoft\u201d\nhere what is usually called \u201cultrasoft\u201d in the context of\nSCET and in the power counting our \u03b4 corresponds to \u03bb2\nin [7].) For each direction defined by an energetic par-\nticle we introduce two reference light-like vectors, n\u00b1,\nwith n2+ = n\n2\n\u2212 = 0 and n+n\u2212 = 2 and we write the\ncorresponding momentum as\np\u00b5 = (n+p)\nn\u00b5\u2212\n2\n+ p\u00b5\u22a5 + (n\u2212p)\nn\u00b5+\n2\n, (11)\nwhere n+p \u223c M , n\u2212p \u223c M\u03b4 and p\u22a5 \u223c M\u03b41\/2. Given a\ncertain direction n\u2212 we introduce the collinear field \u03c8c\nwhich satisfies 6n\u2212\u03c8c = 0. The terms relevant for the\ncalculation of T (0) + T (1) are then given by\nLSCET = \u03c8\u00afc\n(\nin\u2212D + i 6D\u22a5c 1\nin+Dc + i\u01eb\ni 6D\u22a5c\n) 6n+\n2\n\u03c8c .\n(12)\nSince we are concerned with the forward scattering am-\nplitude, the only directions defined by energetic particles\nare given by the incoming electron and (anti)neutrino.\nThus, we have two sets of collinear modes, one for\nthe incoming electron, \u03c8c1, and one for the incoming\n(anti)neutrino, \u03c7c2. Of course, in the case of the neutrino,\nthe covariant derivatives in (12) have to be replaced by\nordinary derivatives. All terms in (12) scale as \u03b42. Terms\nof order \u03b45\/2 and \u03b43 exist, but they are not needed for\nour application, since they would result in contributions\nsuppressed by an additional power of \u03b1 and, therefore,\ncontribute only at NNLO. Again there is no difficulty in\ngoing to higher orders in the expansion if needed.\nThe last part to consider is Lint. It has to include\noperators that allow the production and decay of the un-\nstable particle. Without introducing additional modes it\nis not possible to include such vertices as ordinary inter-\naction terms in the effective Lagrangian [4]. The reason is\nthat the momenta associated with generic collinear fields\n\u03c8c1 and \u03c7\u00afc2 do not add up to a momentum of the form\nP =Mv+k. Either we have to implement this kinematic\nconstraint on our external states by hand [4] or we have\nto introduce a new \u201cexternal-collinear\u201d mode. Adopting\nthe second option, we define an external-collinear mode\nwith large momentum in the ~n\u2212 direction by assigning it\na momentum M\u02c6n\u2212\/2 + k, where k \u223c \u03b4. This mode has\nthe same virtuality M\u02c6\u03b41\/2 as a generic collinear mode but\nthe momentum is not given by (11), because it has a fixed\nlarge component such that the two incoming fermions\nproduce a scalar near mass shell. For such a mode it is\nuseful to extract the fixed large momentum and to define\n\u03c8n\n\u2212\n(x) \u2261 eiM\u02c6\/2 (n\u2212x)P+ \u03c8c1(x), (13)\nand similarly for \u03c7n+ . For the purpose of computing\nT (0)+T (1) it is sufficient to take the first term of LSCET,\n(12), with a soft photon only to describe the interaction\nof the external-collinear fermions with the photons\nL\u00b1 = \u03c8\u00afn\n\u2212\nin\u2212Ds\n6n+\n2\n\u03c8n\n\u2212\n+ \u03c7\u00afn+in+\u2202\n6n\u2212\n2\n\u03c7n+ . (14)\nWith the external-collinear modes we can implement\nthe production and decay vertices as interaction terms\nin Lint. It is also convenient to integrate out generic\ncollinear fields and keep only the external-collinear modes\nin the effective theory. Because adding soft fields results\nin a further suppression in \u03b4 we then find that we can\nrestrict ourselves to\nLint = C y \u03c6v\u03c8\u00afn\n\u2212\n\u03c7n+ + C y\n\u2217\u03c6\u2020v\u03c7\u00afn+\u03c8n\u2212\n+ F\nyy\u2217\nM\u02c62\n(\n\u03c8\u00afn\n\u2212\n\u03c7n+\n)(\n\u03c7\u00afn+\u03c8n\u2212\n)\n, (15)\nwhere C = 1+O(\u03b1) and F are the matching coefficients.\nThe external fields scale as \u03b43\/2. Thus, an insertion of\na \u03c6\u03c8\u03c7 operator results in\n\u222b\nd4x\u03c6v\u03c8\u00afn\n\u2212\n\u03c7n+ \u223c \u03b41\/2. The\nforward scattering amplitude can be obtained by two in-\nsertions of this operator. Taking into account the scaling\nof the external state \u3008\u03bd\u00afe\u2212| \u223c \u03b4\u22121 we see that T (0) \u223c \u03b1\/\u03b4.\nThe four-fermion operator is suppressed in \u03b4 and results\nin a contribution of order \u03b1 to T . Thus, to compute T (1)\nwe need C(1), the O(\u03b1) contribution to the matching co-\nefficient C, while F is only needed at tree level.\nThe coefficient C(1) is obtained by matching the on-\nshell three-point function of a scalar field, an electron and\na neutrino at order y\u03b1 and at leading order in \u03b4. In par-\nticular, this involves the computation of (the hard part)\nof the vertex diagram, and the additional wave-function\nnormalization factor \u031f\u22121\/2 mentioned above has to be\ntaken into account. For the precise matching equation as\nwell as the explicit result for C(1) we refer to [4]. Here it\nsuffices to say that these are standard loop calculations.\nTo obtain F (0) (the LO contribution to F ) we have to\nmatch the four-point function at tree level, but include\nsubleading terms in \u03b4. The explicit result is F (0) = 1\/4.\n480 90 100 110 120\n10-5\n10-4\n10-3\nFIG. 1: The line shape (in GeV\u22122) in the effective the-\nory at LO (light grey\/magenta dashed) and NLO (light\ngrey\/magenta) and the LO cross section off resonance in the\nfull theory (dark grey\/blue dashed) as a function of the center-\nof-mass energy (in GeV).\nWe have now completed the construction of the effec-\ntive Lagrangian Leff = LHSET+L\u00b1+Lint to an accuracy\nsufficient to compute T at NLO. At leading order there\nis only one diagram, involving two three-point vertices\nand one resonant scalar propagator. We get\niT (0) = \u2212i yy\n\u2217\n2M\u02c6D [u\u00af(p)v(q)] [v\u00af(q)u(p)], (16)\nwhere we defined D \u2261 \u221as\u2212 M\u02c6 \u2212\u2206(1)\/2. In the effective\ntheory there are three classes of diagrams that contribute\nto T (1). Firstly, there are hard corrections consisting of a\npropagator insertion [\u2206(1)]2\/4\u2212 M\u02c6\u2206(2) as well as a ver-\ntex insertion C(1). Secondly, there is a four-point vertex\ndiagram due to the (\u03c8\u00af\u03c7)(\u03c7\u00af\u03c8) operator in Lint. The third\nclass are soft-photon loop diagrams, corresponding to the\nnon-factorizable corrections. Adding up all these contri-\nbutions and using the explicit result for C(1) (in the MS\nscheme) [4] we obtain\ni T (1) = i T (0)\u00d7 (17)[\nag\n(\n3 ln\n\u22122M\u02c6D\n\u03bd2\n+ 4 ln\n\u22122M\u02c6D\nM\u02c62\nln\n\u22122M\u02c6D\n\u03bd2\n\u2212 7 ln \u22122M\u02c6D\nM\u02c62\n\u2212 3\n2\nln\nM\u02c62\n\u00b52\n\u2212 7\n2\n+\n2\u03c02\n3\n)\n+ ay\n(\n2 ln\nM\u02c62\n\u00b52\n\u2212 1\n2\n\u2212 i\u03c0\n)\n\u2212 [\u2206\n(1)]2\n8DM\u02c6 +\n\u2206(2)\n2D \u2212\nD\n2M\u02c6\n]\n,\nwhere ai \u2261 \u03b1i\/(4\u03c0). The initial state collinear singular-\nities have been subtracted minimally and we denote the\ncorresponding factorization scale by \u03bd to distinguish it\nfrom the renormalization scale \u00b5.\nWe can now perform the polarization average and take\nthe imaginary part of (T (0) + T (1))\/s. This result de-\nscribes the line shape near resonance with a relative er-\nror of \u03b12. Moving away from the resonance, the relative\nerror becomes of order unity, since \u03b4 is not small any\nlonger. To obtain a good description for all values of\n\u221a\ns,\nthe result of the effective theory has to be matched to\nthe off-resonance result of the full theory.\nIn Figure 1 we show the leading order line shape in\nthe effective theory and the tree-level (order \u03b12) cross\nsection off resonance in the full theory. The two results\nagree in an intermediate region where both calculations\nare valid. This allows to obtain a consistent LO result\nfor all values of\n\u221a\ns. We also show the NLO line shape.\nFor the numerical results we have chosen to use the MS\nscheme with \u03b1y = \u03b1g = 0.1 and \u03b1\u03bb = (0.1)\n2\/(4\u03c0). The\npole mass is assumed to be M = 100 GeV which results\nin the MS value M\u02c6 = 98.8 GeV for the LO result and\nM\u02c6 = 99.1 GeV for the NLO result. Furthermore, we have\nchosen a variable factorization scale such that there are\nno large logarithms involving \u03bd. We remark that in order\nto obtain an improved NLO result for the whole region\nof\n\u221a\ns, the NLO line shape would have to be matched to\nthe NLO off-resonance cross section in the full theory.\nThe example considered here is based on a rather sim-\nple toy model. Nevertheless, it allows to address the\nconceptual issues related to unstable particles. The main\nresult is that, using an effective theory approach, calcula-\ntions can be performed in a systematic way in expanding\nin the small quantities \u03b1 and \u0393\/M . Applying our method\nto the Standard Model might require more tedious calcu-\nlations, but the main result remains valid. In particular,\nas discussed in [4], NNLO line-shape calculations now\nappear feasible.\nThe work of M.B. and A.P.C. is supported in\npart by the DFG Sonderforschungsbereich\/Transregio 9\n\u201cComputer-gestu\u00a8tzte Theoretische Teilchenphysik\u201d\n[1] R.
