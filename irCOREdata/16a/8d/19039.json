Instead, ECD of nitrated peptides is characterised by\nabundant losses of small neutrals (hydroxyl radicals, water and ammonia). Here, we investigate\nthe origin of ammonia loss by comparing the ECD behaviour of lysine- and arginine-containing\nnitrated peptides, and their N-acetylated counterparts, and nitrated peptides containing no basic\namino acid residues. The results reveal that ammonia loss derives from the N-terminus of the\npeptides, however, the key \ufb01nding of this work is the insight provided into the hierarchy of\nvarious proposed ECD mechanisms: the Utah-Washington mechanism, the electron predator\nmechanism and the Oslo mechanism.\nIntroduction\nTandem mass spectrometry (MS\/MS), in which a precursor\nion is characterised according to its fragments, is well-established.\nThe introduction of electron capture dissociation (ECD) in\n19981 provided a unique MS\/MS technique for biomolecular\nanalysis,2 in particular for peptides and proteins. In peptide\/\nprotein ECD, low energy electrons are captured by multiply-\ncharged cations with subsequent cleavage of N\u2013Ca bonds,\ni.e., cleavage is radically-driven. ECD o\ufb00ers advantages over\nthermally-driven \u2018slow-heating\u2019 MS\/MS techniques3 such as\ncollision induced dissociation (CID) and infrared multiphoton\ndissociation (IRMPD): ECD cleavage is random and therefore\nsequence coverage tends to be higher,4,5 and labile post-\ntranslational modi\ufb01cations (PTMs) are retained on peptide\/\nprotein backbone fragments.6 ECD has been successfully\napplied to the localisation of sites of phosphorylation (serine (S),\nthreonine (T) and tyrosine (Y))7,8 and N- and O-linked\nglycosylation,9,10 amongst others.\nThe major product of electron capture by peptide\n[M + nH]n+ cations is typically the charge-reduced species\n[M + nH](n\u00021)+\u0003, that is, the precursor peptide ion that has\ncaptured an electron but has not dissociated. Often, that is\naccompanied by hydrogen atom loss, i.e., formation of\n[M + (n \u0002 1)H](n\u00021)+. The dominant peptide backbone\nfragmentation pathway proceeds via cleavage of the N\u2013Ca\nbond to give c and z\u0003 fragment ions11 (which may be accompanied\nby hydrogen atom transfer to give c\u0003 and, more commonly,\nz fragment ions12). That pathway is in contrast to that\nobserved for CID in which peptide backbone cleavage occurs\nat N\u2013CO bonds producing b and y fragment ions.\n13 Scheme 1\nshows peptide backbone cleavage sites and fragment ion\nnotation.\nThe mechanism by which c and z fragments are generated\nfollowing electron capture has been the subject of intense\ndebate. Two proposed mechanisms have held precedence:\nthe Cornell mechanism and the Utah-Washington mechanism,\nboth of which are elegantly described in a recent publication\nby Simons.14 In short, the Cornell mechanism, proposed by\nMcLa\ufb00erty and co-workers,1 posits initial electron capture to\nhigh-n Rydberg states with subsequent localisation to a site of\nprotonation (e.g., lysine or arginine side-chain) forming a\nhypervalent radical. Hydrogen atom ejection and capture by\nthe amide oxygen occurs followed by cleavage of the adjacent\nN\u2013Ca bond. A limitation of the Cornell mechanism is the\nfailure to explain the observation of c and z fragments for\nspecies in which mobile hydrogen atoms are absent, for\nexample metal-cationised peptides15,16 and peptides carrying\n\ufb01xed charge derivatives.17,18 A further limitation is that hydrogen\natom transfer from an arginine radical to an amide carbonyl is\nan endothermic process.19 The Utah-Washington (UW)\nmechanism suggests that electron capture to a Coulomb-\nstabilised amide p* orbital occurs, either directly or via\nthrough bond electron transfer from a Rydberg state, rendering\nthe amide bond superbasic, with a proton a\ufb03nity in the range\nof 1100\u20131400 kJ mol\u00021.20,21 The amide anion radical sub-\nsequently abstracts a proton from an accessible site resulting in\nc and z\u0003 fragments. Recent theoretical studies14 suggest that\ninitial electron attachment generally occurs to a Rydberg\norbital (90\u201399%) with some (1\u201310%) direct attachment to\nScheme 1 Sites of peptide backbone cleavage and fragment ion\nnotation.\nSchool of Biosciences, College of Life and Environmental Sciences,\nUniversity of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.\nE-mail: H.J.Cooper@bham.ac.uk; Fax: +44 (0)121 414 5925;\nTel: +44 (0)121 414 7527\nw Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: CID MS\/MS\nspectra of N-acetylated peptides; CID experimental data.

Experimental evidence for this\npathway was previously provided by Beauchamp and\nco-workers.22 They observed that peptide modi\ufb01cations with\nan electron a\ufb03nity (EA) of Z 1.00 eV (speci\ufb01cally benzyl\nmodi\ufb01cations of cysteine) had a deleterious e\ufb00ect on ECD\npeptide backbone fragmentation and postulated that following\ninitial electron capture to high-n Rydberg states, electron\nrelaxation via through-space or through-bond transfer to the\nhigh-EA modi\ufb01cation occurs in competition with transfer to\nthe amide p* orbital (UW mechanism). They termed this\nmodel the \u2018electron predator\u2019 mechanism.\nA second minor fragmentation channel often observed in\nthe ECD of peptide ions is the production of a\u0003 and y\nfragments. In one of the original ECD papers, it was postulated\nthat a\u0003\/y cleavage occurs via a variation of the Cornell\nmechanism, i.e., rather than hydrogen atom transfer to an\namide oxygen, hydrogen atom transfer to a backbone nitrogen\noccurs and is followed by heterolytic cleavage of the peptide\nbond with concomitant loss of CO.23 For certain peptidic\nstructures, e.g., e-peptides, a\u0003\/y-type cleavage constitutes the\nmajor fragmentation pathway.24 Finally, b ions may be\nobserved in the ECD mass spectra of some peptides depending\non their structure and the charge-carrier.25 Previous work by\nus showed that the formation of b ions was not the result of\nsecondary fragmentation of c ions. One possible explanation\nfor the production of b ions is that electron capture by the\nprecursor peptide ion followed by hydrogen atom loss might\nresult in a vibrationally-excited even-electron ion which could\ndissociate via a mobile proton pathway, as observed in CID.\nAn alternative explanation derives from modelling studies by\nUggerud and co-workers.26 They investigated the e\ufb00ect of the\ninitial position of the proton on the ECD fragmentation\nbehaviour and showed that for nitrogen-protonated peptide\nions, the expected result was b\u0003 and y fragments. We term this\nmodel the \u2018Oslo mechanism\u2019. Experimental studies by Liu and\nHa\u02dakansson on peptides which did not contain basic amino\nacid residues (BAARs), and therefore must contain proto-\nnated amide nitrogens, con\ufb01rmed the hypothesis: abundant\nb-type ions were observed.27 It should be noted however that\nUggerud\u2019s studies suggested radical b ions whereas the b ions\nobserved by us25 and Ha\u02dakansson27 were even-electron. That\nobservation could be explained by hydrogen atom transfer\nwithin a long-lived b\u0003\/y ion complex, similar to that observed\nfor c\/z\u0003 ions.27\nWe have recently shown that the presence of 3-nitrotyrosine\nwithin a peptide sequence has a deleterious e\ufb00ect on ECD\nbackbone cleavage of the c\/z type.28 All of the peptides studied\ncontained lysine as the charge-carrier. The e\ufb00ect was particularly\nsevere for doubly-protonated precursor ions and can be\nexplained by the electron predator mechanism proposed by\nBeauchamp and co-workers.22 In addition, we showed that the\nECD mass spectra were dominated by peaks corresponding to\nthe loss of small neutrals (\u0003OH\/H2O\/NH3) from the charge-\nreduced precursor. ECD data from a series of nitrated peptides\nin which the number of amino acid residues between the\nnitrotyrosine and the lysine was varied suggested that the\nproximity of the two was proportional to the abundance of\nthe ammonia loss. Furthermore, 15N-labelling experiments\nrevealed that the nitrotyrosine was not the source of ammonia\nloss. We postulated that the ammonia losses were the result of\nnon-covalent interactions between the protonated lysine\namino acid side-chains and the nitro group. An alternative\nexplanation is that the ammonia loss derives from the\nprotonated N-terminus of the peptides.\nHere, we have investigated the origin of ammonia loss in the\nECD of nitrated peptides. We compare the small neutral losses\nobserved for nitrated peptides containing lysine, arginine and\nno basic amino acid residues. We also investigate the e\ufb00ect of\nacetylating the peptide N-terminus. Finally, we performed\nMS3 (ECD of the precursor peptide followed by IRMPD of\nthe neutral loss ECD fragments). The results reveal that\nammonia loss derives from the N-terminus. More importantly,\nthe results show how the hierarchy of ECDmechanisms can be\ndeduced in part by considering the fragmentation behaviour of\nnitrated peptides.\nResults and discussion\nWe showed previously that ECD of the doubly-protonated ions\nof peptides GPLEnYGFAK and GPLEnYGFAKGPLAK\n(nY is 3-nitrotyrosine), and triply-protonated ions of\nGPLEnYGFAKGPLAK, resulted in extensive neutral losses\nfrom the charge-reduced precursor ions.28 The dominant\nlosses were [\u0003OH + H2O + NH3] from GPLEnYGFAK\nand GPLEnYGFAKGPLAK in the 2+ and 3+ charge states,\nrespectively, and [H2O + NH3] from GPLEnYGFAKGPLAK\nin the 2+ charge state. We postulated that the abundant\nammonia loss was the result of interactions between the\nnitro-group and the lysine side-chain. Fig. 1 shows the ECD\nmass spectra obtained for the doubly protonated ions of\npeptides GPLEnYGFAR and GPLEnYGFARGPLAR, i.e.,\nthe equivalent peptides in which lysine amino acid residues\nhave been substituted for arginine residues. As seen for\nthe Lys-containing peptides, the presence of nitrotyrosine\nsuppresses ECD peptide backbone cleavage in the Arg-\ncontaining peptides, i.e., electron capture proceeds via the\nelectron predator mechanism independent of the nature of\nthe basic amino acid residue. Abundant peaks corresponding\nto neutral losses from the charge-reduced species were also\nobserved for the Arg-containing nitrated peptides. As for the\nLys-containing analogue, the most abundant loss observed on\nECD of 2+ ions of GPLEnYGFAR is [\u0003OH+H2O+NH3],\nhowever the neutral loss pro\ufb01les do vary between the\npeptides: the relative abundance of the [\u0003OH + H2O] loss\nis much greater for the Arg peptide than for the Lys peptide.\nIn addition, neutral losses involving CO were observed\nfor the Arg peptide, as were fragments resulting from\ncleavages within the Arg side chain. For the longer peptides\n(GPLEnYGFA(R\/K)GPLA(R\/K)), variation in the neutral\nloss pro\ufb01les is again observed. For the Lys-containing\npeptides, the most abundant loss was [H2O + NH3] whereas\nfor the Arg-containing peptide the most abundant losses are\n[\u0003OH + H2O + NH3] and H2O. Losses involving CO were\nobserved for the Arg-containing peptide.\nThe results obtained for the Arg-containing peptides appear\nto corroborate the hypothesis that ammonia loss derives from\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \non\n 2\n3 \nD\nec\nem\nbe\nr 2\n01\n0\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n o\nn \nht\ntp\n:\/\/\npu\nbs\n.rs\nc.\nor\ng \n| do\ni:1\n0.1\n039\n\/C0\nCP\n006\n23H\nView Online\n13396 Phys.

To determine unambiguously\nwhether that was the case we performed two experiments.\nFirstly, we examined the ECD behaviour of the nitrated\npeptide GPLEnYGFAL in which Lys\/Arg has been substituted\nwith Leu, i.e., contains no basic amino acid residue (BAAR).\nSecondly, we investigated the ECD behaviour of the Arg- and\nLys-containing peptides which had been N-acetylated thus\npreventing any ammonia loss from the N-terminus. (We have\nshown previously, via 15N isotope labelling experiments, that\nammonia loss does not derive from the nitro group28).\nFig. 2 shows the ECD mass spectra of doubly-charged ions\nof the non-BAAR-containing unmodi\ufb01ed and nitrated\npeptides. There are two main points of interest: the abundant\nloss of small neutrals is not observed for the nitrated peptide\nand the presence of the nitrotyrosine does not a\ufb00ect the\nbackbone cleavage observed. Moreover, for both the nitrated\nand unmodi\ufb01ed peptides signi\ufb01cant b-type fragmentation is\nobserved. At \ufb01rst glance the substantial decrease in neutral\nlosses (no losses involving ammonia and low level loss of \u0003OH\nand water) appears to con\ufb01rm that the losses derive from basic\namino acid side-chains. However, the similarity between the\nECD mass spectra from the two peptides suggests that caution\nshould be exercised before drawing such a conclusion.\nThe electron predator mechanism does not appear to apply\nto nitrated GPLEnYGFAL because ECD backbone fragments\nare observed. The peptide does not contain a basic amino acid\nand presumably is therefore protonated on a backbone amide\nnitrogen. As described above, Liu and Ha\u02dakansson27 have\npreviously shown that such a situation leads to b-type\nfragmentation via the Oslo mechanism. This result suggests\nthat the Oslo mechanism takes precedence over the electron\npredator mechanism.\nFig. 3 shows ECD mass spectra of the doubly-charged ions\nof the N-acetylated nitrated peptides Ac-GPLEnYGFAK\/R.\n(Acetylation solely of the N-terminus was con\ufb01rmed by CID,\nsee ESIw, Fig. S1.) Three salient features of the ECD mass\nspectra can be identi\ufb01ed. Firstly, neutral losses involving NH3\nwere not observed in the ECD of N-acetylated nitrated\npeptides. Secondly, abundant losses of \u0003OH radicals and water\nare observed. Finally, the backbone cleavage observed di\ufb00ers\nfrom that observed in the absence of N-acetylation. The\nobservation that neutral losses involving ammonia were not\nobserved suggests that NH3 loss derives from the N-terminus,\nin contrast to the results for the non-BAAR-containing peptide.\nThe continued losses of \u0003OH radicals and water suggest that\nthese derive from interactions between the nitro group and the\nbasic amino acid chain.22,29 For the Lys-containing nitrated\npeptide, N-acetylation results in the appearance of additional\nFig. 1 ECD mass spectra of (a) [GPLEnYGFAR + 2H]2+ ions;\n(b) ECD of [GPLEnYGFARGPLAR + 2H]2+ ions. nY denotes\n3-nitrotyrosine.

The a7\n\u0003 fragment ion is the most abundant\npeak in the mass spectrum. Similar observations were made\nfor the Arg-containing peptide: N-acetylation results in the\nappearance of b7\n\u0003 and b8 fragments in the ECD mass\nspectrum, with b7\n\u0003 being the most abundant product ion.\nThese observations can be explained in terms of the protonation\nstate of the precursor ions. For the non-acetylated nitrated\npeptides, the sites of protonation are presumed to be the basic\namino acid side-chain (Lys\/Arg) and the N-terminus for\ndoubly-charged ions. Acetylation precludes protonation at\nthe N-terminus and therefore doubly-charged acetylated\nnitrated peptide ions must contain one proton on the BAAR\nside-chain and one on a backbone amide nitrogen. As shown\npreviously, the presence of a protonated nitrogen promotes the\nOslo mechanism of ECD and that is con\ufb01rmed here by the\npresence of b-type ions. Again this result suggests that the Oslo\nmechanism takes precedence over the electron predator and\nUW (or Cornell) mechanism.\nECD experiments on the non-BAAR-containing nitrated\npeptide and N-acetylated nitrated peptides appeared to give\ncon\ufb02icting results with regard to the origin of ammonia loss\n(although as discussed the di\ufb00erences can be explained in\nterms of competing mechanisms). Nevertheless, in order to\nunambiguously determine the origin of ammonia loss, we\nperformed MS3 experiments.\nFig. 4 shows the MS3 (IRMPD of ECD fragments) spectra\nof three nitrated doubly-charged peptides; in all cases ECD\nFig. 3 ECD mass spectra of doubly-charged N-terminal acetylated\npeptide ions: (a) [Ac-GPLEnYGFAK + 2H]2+; (b) [Ac-GPLEnYG-\nFAR + 2H]2+. * corresponds to the 2nd harmonic peak.\nFig. 4 MS3 (IRMPD of ECD fragments) mass spectra of doubly-\ncharged peptide ions: (a) [[GPLEnYGFAK+2H]+\u2013[\u0003OH+H2O+NH3]]\nions; (b) [[GPLEnYGFAR + 2H]+\u2013[\u0003OH + H2O + NH3]] ions;\n(c) [[AAAnYAAAK + 2H]+\u2013[\u0003OH + H2O + NH3]] ions. * denotes\nnoise peak.\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \non\n 2\n3 \nD\nec\nem\nbe\nr 2\n01\n0\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n o\nn \nht\ntp\n:\/\/\npu\nbs\n.rs\nc.\nor\ng \n| do\ni:1\n0.1\n039\n\/C0\nCP\n006\n23H\nView Online\n13398 Phys.

A\npeak corresponding to the y5 fragment of the precursor\npeptide less the mass of two oxygen atoms is observed\nsuggesting that the water and \u0003OH losses derive from the\nnitrotyrosine residue. The peak corresponding to the b3\nfragment of the precursor less ammonia and two hydrogen\natoms suggests that ammonia loss occurs N-terminal of the\nleucine residue. Also noteworthy is the presence of a peak\ncorresponding to the loss of a glutamic acid residue. That\nsuggests that the loss of ammonia may involve reaction of the\nN-terminus with nitrotyrosine and concomitant cleavage of\nthe glutamic acid\u2013tyrosine, or leucine\u2013glutamic acid, peptide\nbond. Similar results were observed for the MS3 of\nGPLEnYGFAR: the data suggest that hydroxyl radical and\nwater losses originate from nitrotyrosine whereas ammonia\nloss originates at the N-terminus. The MS3 results for\nAAAnYAAAK are less conclusive. Nevertheless they show\nthat \u0003OH, water and ammonia losses all arise N-terminal\nof Ala4.\nExperimental\nPreparation of synthetic peptides\nThe nitrated peptides, GPLEnYGFAK, GPLEnYGFAKG-\nPLAK, GPLEnYGFAR, GPLEnYGFARGPLAR, and\nGPLEnYGFAL (where nY indicates 3-nitrotyrosine), their\nunmodi\ufb01ed counterparts and AAAnYAAAK were synthesised\nby Alta Bioscience (Birmingham, UK).

Each ECD scan\ncomprises 4 co-added microscans. Mass spectra shown\ncomprise 30 averaged scans.\nMS3 (IRMPD of ECD fragments). Analyses were performed\non a Bruker 12 T Apex Qe Ultra (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA).\nSamples were injected by use of an Advion Biosciences Triversa\nelectrospray source (Advion Biosciences). Precursor ions were\nisolated by use of the mass resolving quadrupole. For ECD,\n1.8 A was applied to the dispenser cathode \ufb01lament (Heatwave\nTechnologies), 20 V to the lens, 0.8 V to the bias, and a pulse of\n70 ms was applied. For MS3, ions were isolated in the ICR cell\nvia correlated sweep excitation (COSE) and exposed to a 25 W\nCO2 laser (Synrad Inc., Mukilteo, WA, USA) at 70% power for\n100 ms. Mass spectra shown are the sum of 300 acquisitions.\nECD MS\/MS data were analysed using Xcalibur 2.10\nsoftware (Thermo Fisher Scienti\ufb01c), MS3 data were analysed\nusing DataAnalysis 4.0 software (Bruker Daltonics). All mass\nspectra were manually searched for a, b, c\u0003\/c, y, z\/z0 fragment\nions using Protein Prospector ver. 5.5.0 software (UCSF,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA).\nConclusion\nOur results show that 3-nitrotyrosine-containing peptides\nprovide insight into the hierarchy of the mechanisms of\nelectron capture dissociation. The \ufb01ndings are summarised\nin Scheme 2. Regardless of whether a peptide contains\nnitrotyrosine or not, if the peptide does not contain a basic\namino acid residue, ECD of doubly-protonated ions will\nproceed via the Oslo mechanism to produce b- and y-type\nfragments. If a peptide contains a basic amino acid residue and\nnitrotyrosine (or other modi\ufb01cation with positive electron\na\ufb03nity), the electron predator mechanism will take precedence,\nresulting in no, or few, backbone fragments, and abundant\nlosses of small neutral species. Losses involving ammonia are\nonly observed if the N-terminus of the peptide is able to\ninteract with the nitrotyrosine group. Only in the absence of\nnitrotyrosine (or other modi\ufb01cation with positive electron\na\ufb03nity) and presence of a basic amino acid residue will\nECD proceed via the UW (or the Cornell) mechanism.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work has been funded by EPSRC (A.W.J. and H.J.C.)\nand the Wellcome Trust (074131, H.J.C.).
