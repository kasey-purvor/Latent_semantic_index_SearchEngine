Fundamentally, if we want children to engage in sport from an 7 \nearly age and progress to reach their full potential, then it is arguably vital to \u2018get it right\u2019 during 8 \nthese influential formative years. In fact, there are many important reasons to study the experiences 9 \nof early-career athletes. First, motor abilities (such as co-ordination, reaction time and balance) are 10 \nmost receptive to development at younger ages (e.g., Loko, Aule, Sikkut, Ereline, & Viru, 2000). 11 \nSecond, participation in sport is likely to be an important opportunity to improve these basic motor 12 \nskills. Third, being able to create and maintain an optimal motivational climate amongst early-career 13 \nathletes is likely to increase participation, enjoyment, and motor learning (cf. Theeboom, De Knop, 14 \n& Weiss, 1995). These considerations highlight the importance of being able to understand and 15 \ninfluence the environment surrounding early-career athletes in order to produce optimal motivation 16 \nand associated benefits.  17 \nThere is increasing evidence that peers and parents in the sporting context, as well as coaches, 18 \nall play important roles in influencing motivation (e.g., Allen, 2006; Allen & Hodge, 2006; Gurland 19 \n& Grolnick, 2005; Ullrich-French & Smith, 2006; Vazou, Ntoumanis, & Duda, 2005; White, 1996). 20 \nHence, this paper examines the motivational influences of coaches, parents and peers in the early 21 \ncareer of sport participants. 22 \nSeveral models of athletic career progression exist, beginning with Bloom (1985), and 23 \nincluding C\u00f4t\u00e9 (1999) and Wylleman, Alfermann, and Lavallee (2004). In each case, the early 24 \ncareer is characterised by participants who are generally prompted to try different sports (often by 25 \ntheir parents) to see if they either enjoy it, have some talent or gift, or ideally both. The emphasis is 26 \nmore on \u2018play\u2019 and games than deliberate practice and children in the \u2018initiation\/sampling\u2019 stage are 27 \ngenerally 6-13 years of age (C\u00f4t\u00e9, 1999). Also, according to Wylleman et al. (2004), sport-career 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    4 \n \n  \ninitiators are commonly at primary school, and their key social influences come from parents, peers 1 \nand siblings (where applicable).  2 \nRoberts (2001) argued that motivation is best understood from a social cognitive perspective, 3 \nnot as a function of energisation or arousal per se, but rather as a function of the goals behind the 4 \nmotivated activity. Likewise, Deci and Ryan (2000) succinctly summarised that motivation concerns 5 \nthe \u2018why\u2019 question of behaviour. Hence, when studying the social influences on motivation of young 6 \nathletes participating in sport, one is examining the reasons behind motivated actions and the ways 7 \nin which coaches, parents and peers can influence these reasons. These three social agents, taken 8 \ntogether, may be influential across the vast majority of the athlete\u2019s sporting experience. Taking, as a 9 \nguide, Vallerand\u2019s hierarchical model of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (Vallerand, 1997), 10 \nparents will be a relatively global and omnipresent influence, whereas coaches and peers are likely 11 \nto exert motivational influences both at the contextual (generally within sport, but not at school or at 12 \nhome), and also at the situational levels (specific instances at a particular moment in time). A study 13 \nthat is able to describe and convey a sample of these motivational influences would arguably be 14 \nrelevant to both Vallerand\u2019s theory, and any of the following theories of motivation in sport.  15 \nMotivational climate and achievement goal theory 16 \nThe motivational influence exerted by key social agents is often referred to as the 17 \n\u2018motivational climate\u2019 \u2013 which is a term that originated in achievement goal theory (Ames, 1992; 18 \nNicholls, 1989). In this conceptualisation, sport participants\u2019 state goals are determined by the 19 \ninteraction of their \u2018goal orientation\u2019 (a tendency or proneness in individuals towards adopting 20 \ncertain achievement goals; Roberts, 2001), with the situational goal climate (the specific pragmatic 21 \nand social situations in which the achievement task is defined; Ames, 1992). The traditional 22 \ndichotomous achievement goal framework defines these goals in one of two ways: performance\/ego 23 \ngoals emphasise normative evaluations and outperforming others; mastery\/task goals emphasise 24 \neffort, personal improvement and task mastery (Nicholls, 1989). Within motivational climate 25 \nresearch, these different definitions of competence, and related goal adoptions, have been correlated 26 \nto different motivational outcomes and behaviours, including positive affect, negative affect, 27 \nperceived competence, strategies used (e.g., cheating, self-teaching), sportspersonship, the 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    5 \n \n  \ndeployment of mental skills, actual motor improvement, and experience of \u2018flow\u2019 (for reviews, see 1 \nDuda & Whitehead, 1998; Harwood, Spray, & Keegan, 2008). 2 \nNicholls\u2019 contribution to achievement goal theory emerged from a systematic programme of 3 \nresearch that examined how young children gradually learn to differentiate between effort, task 4 \ndifficulty and luck in achievement tasks. According to Nicholls (1989), children below the age of 5 \n11-12 are not able to differentiate between ability and effort, and so cannot become ego-involved 6 \n(i.e., they cannot be interested in demonstrating superior ability with less or equal effort). As such, 7 \nall children are proposed to only experience task involvement until they come to realise that ability 8 \nand effort can be inversely related. This has been the assumption in the majority of research into 9 \nmotivational climates (e.g., Vazou et al., 2005) and so early career sport participants under the age 10 \nof 12, i.e. those who are characteristically initiating their sporting careers, have rarely been studied.  11 \nAmes\u2019 research led to a consideration of the ways in which teachers and coaches can 12 \nemphasise achievement goals (Ames, 1992; Ames & Archer, 1988). The acronym TARGET was 13 \ncoined to denote the variety of relevant teaching behaviours: Tasks, Authority, Recognition, 14 \nGroupings, Evaluation and Timing. A task-climate would include collaborative tasks, democratic 15 \nleadership, recognition for effort and improvement, mixed ability groupings, individual evaluation, 16 \nand sufficient time for everyone to learn a skill. An ego-climate would include competitive tasks, 17 \nautocratic leadership, recognition of normative ability, segregation by ability, normative evaluation, 18 \nand time for only the more advanced students to complete a task. In most coaching environments, 19 \nhowever, the above behaviours are likely to occur interchangeably depending on the circumstances, 20 \nand so it is unlikely that an exclusively ego or task climate will be perceived.  21 \nThe TARGET framework was initially used to inform interventions and assess motivational 22 \noutcomes (e.g., Seifriz, Duda, & Chi, 1992), but it has also contributed to the development of 23 \nseveral questionnaires measuring how athletes perceive their motivational climate (e.g., Ames & 24 \nArcher, 1988; Newton, Duda, & Yin, 2000; Papaioannou, 1994; Seifriz et al., 1992). Results from 25 \nstudies utilising these questionnaires have shown that perceived climate is often associated with 26 \nimportant motivational variables. However, Duda and Whitehead (1998) highlighted a number of 27 \nlimitations of the questionnaire approach to studying motivational climate, not least that 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    6 \n \n  \nresearchers tended to only present the results of composite mastery or performance scores and not 1 \nthe underpinning subscales; precluding options to explore any differences between subscales (and 2 \ntherefore limiting understanding). Additionally, the subtleties of measuring the perceptions of how 3 \na group of athletes feel their coaches, parents and peers emphasise one-or-another definition of 4 \ncompetence, and then trying to use this for applied interventions are slowly beginning to 5 \nundermine the utility of a questionnaire-based approach (for a discussion, see Papaioannou, 6 \nMilosis, Kosmidou, & Tsigilis, 2007). As a consequence, it may be beneficial to examine 7 \nmotivational climate by qualitatively assessing influences of coaches, parents and peers together, 8 \nwith a view to arriving at specific applied recommendations that can inform interventions.  9 \nReturning to the consideration of Nicholls\u2019 work (Nicholls, 1989), if it is the case that children 10 \nbecome able to differentiate between effort and ability at around the age of 12, and therefore able to 11 \ntruly experience ego involvement, there may be a strong argument in favour of making the 12 \nmotivational climate around this age strongly mastery-oriented, such that the salience of ego goals 13 \nand their associated negative motivational impact might be reduced (Harwood et al., 2008). Smith, 14 \nCumming and Smoll (2008) recently developed a questionnaire to assess perceived achievement 15 \ngoal climates with athletes between 9-14 years of age (the Motivational Climate Scale for Youth 16 \nSports; MCSYS). However, this study explicitly used the dichotomous framework (\u2018mastery\u2019 vs. 17 \n\u2018ego\u2019 goals) to develop a two-factor model; effectively creating a PMCSQ-2 for use with young 18 \nperformers. This differentiates it from the current paper, which uses a qualitative approach in an 19 \nattempt to access the potentially unique and rich phenomenon of the motivational climate in youth 20 \nsport. In this respect, the current study is intended to complement existing research by providing a 21 \ndetailed account of the behaviours and actions that contribute to motivation in young athletes.  22 \nTheoretical developments: Approach and avoidance goals 23 \nIn its original conceptualisation, achievement goal theory did not specifically differentiate 24 \nsocial and self-awareness considerations from purely competence-based goals \u2013 meaning their 25 \ninfluence could not be separately assessed (Elliot & Thrash, 2001). Elliot and colleagues (e.g., Elliot, 26 \n2005) have argued that the achievement goal construct should focus solely on whether the aim is to 27 \ndemonstrate competence (approach valenced goal) or to avoid demonstrating incompetence 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    7 \n \n  \n(avoidance valenced goal) \u2013 being careful to theoretically and empirically separate goals from the 1 \nreasons underpinning their pursuit. Elliot (1997, 1999) asserted that equivocal findings in the 2 \nachievement goal literature concerning the motivational impact of performance goals were partly a 3 \nresult of the failure to distinguish both approach and avoidance forms of normatively-defined goals 4 \n(and partly a result of the inclusion of social and self-awareness considerations within the 5 \nmeasurement of goals). Elliot (1997; Elliot & Church, 1997) proposed a trichotomous model 6 \n(mastery goals, performance-avoidance goals, and performance-approach goals) and, more recently, 7 \na two-by-two model in which mastery goals are further divided into mastery-approach and mastery-8 \navoidance, giving two dimensions (valence and definition) and four possible goals (performance-9 \napproach, performance-avoidance, mastery-approach, mastery-avoidance; Elliot & McGregor, 10 \n2001). In Elliot and Church\u2019s (1997) hierarchical model of achievement goals, intrapersonal and 11 \nsituational antecedents are hypothesised to influence the adoption of any of the four goals. Although 12 \none of the antecedents posited is \u2018motivational climate\u2019, there is currently a dearth of research that 13 \nexamines how key social agents can influence the adoption of approach versus avoidance goals in 14 \nsport. In physical education, Barkousis et al. (2007) used the LAPOPECQ (a dichotomous measure 15 \nof perceived motivational climate; Papaioannou, 1994) to predict trichotomous goal-adoptions and 16 \nfound that the subscale 'worry about mistakes' (a performance-climate subscale) was a positive 17 \npredictor of both mastery- and performance-avoidance goals. This research suggests that students in 18 \nthese classes were able to differentiate between positive and negative situational\/contextual cues, 19 \nand also indicates a growing need to reconcile separate models of achievement motivation within 20 \nmotivational climate research, particularly in sport. 21 \nSocial goals in achievement contexts 22 \nMaehr and Nicholls (1980) included in their original theoretical framework of achievement 23 \ngoals a 'social approval goal orientation' in addition to task and ego goal orientations. They 24 \nsuggested that a social approval goal orientation emphasises the desire for acceptance by 25 \nsignificant others through conformity to norms while displaying maximal effort. More recently, 26 \nUrdan and Maehr (1995) called for the reconsideration of social goal orientations in describing 27 \nand explaining achievement behaviour. Social goals may include social welfare goals (i.e., to 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    8 \n \n  \nbenefit the larger society by becoming a productive member), social responsibility (i.e., to be 1 \nconscientious), social affiliation (i.e., to feel a sense of belonging), social relationship goals, and 2 \nsocial status goals (Urdan & Maehr, 1995; Wentzel, 1993). Allen (2006) has reported that 3 \nfriendships and group memberships are key motivating factors in sport, whilst Ullrich-French and 4 \nSmith (2006) noted that the quality of friendship and peer acceptance also influenced motivational 5 \nvariables such as enjoyment and perceived competence. 6 \nGiven the variety of conceptually and qualitatively distinct types of relationship that are 7 \npossible between an athlete and their coach, parents and peers, there is likely to be a corresponding 8 \nvariety of possible social goals. For example, peer relationships are relationships between relative 9 \nequals, while athlete-adult relationships may often represent imbalances in power, and this is likely 10 \nto impact upon the social goals adopted by the athlete in each instance, as well as the ways in which 11 \nmotivational goals are endorsed, perceived, adopted and reinforced. Significant others in sport 12 \nrepresent consistent sources of motivation (Weiss & Ferrer-Caja, 2002) and, whilst research is 13 \nongoing into the specific nature and impact of social relationships in sport, it is clear that social goals 14 \nare very relevant to the phenomenon of the social motivational climate. 15 \nTheoretical developments: Is the construct of motivational climate broadening? 16 \nTo date, the construct of motivational climate has been studied with regard to the 17 \ndichotomous model of achievement goals, with a mastery climate hypothesised to induce task 18 \ngoals, and a performance climate to induce ego goals. The majority of this research has assessed 19 \nthe perceived influence of coaches, teachers and parents on athletes\u2019 motivation in sport (e.g., 20 \nWhite, 1996; Williams, 1998), although more recent work has examined the influence of peers 21 \n(Ntoumanis & Vazou, 2006; Vazou et al., 2005). While this body of work has led to some debate 22 \nconcerning the conceptualisation of achievement goals and the mechanisms by which they are 23 \ninvoked or adopted, motivational climate has continued to be studied using the performance\/ego 24 \nversus mastery\/task dichotomy. Exceptions to this general tendency are Mageau and Vallerand 25 \n(2003), who presented a model of coaching that highlighted the importance of autonomy support 26 \nin improving athletic motivation, and Allen and Hodge (2006), who reviewed an array of evidence 27 \nsuggesting that our conceptualisation of motivational climate should be expanded to include the 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    9 \n \n  \nself-determination theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 2000) constructs of relatedness (\u201ca concern about 1 \nconnections with others and the quality of our interpersonal relationships.\u201d p. 268) and autonomy 2 \n(the degree to which athletes \u201cengage in the activity for their own valued reasons and feel that they 3 \nhave freely chosen to be involved\u201d p. 267), in addition to competence. Mageau and Vallerand cite 4 \nresearch specifying that autonomy supportive behaviours may include offering choices, providing 5 \na rationale for decisions\/tasks, acknowledging the athlete's feelings, allowing independent training, 6 \ngiving non-controlling competence feedback, and avoiding controlling behaviours such as tangible 7 \nrewards. Whilst they are less clear in specifying relatedness-supportive behaviours, examples 8 \ninclude forming a supportive, warm relationship with athletes and encouraging the formation of 9 \nfriendships within teams. Deci, Vallerand, Pellettier and Ryan (1991) summarised their position, 10 \nthat: \u201cmotivation, performance, and development will be maximized within social contexts that 11 \nprovide people the opportunity to satisfy their basic psychological needs for competence, 12 \nrelatedness, and autonomy\u201d (p. 327-328). 13 \n To the extent that social contexts do not allow satisfaction of the three basic psychological 14 \nneeds, they will diminish motivation, impair the natural developmental process, and lead to 15 \nalienation and poorer performance. It should be noted that SDT is not mutually exclusive from 16 \nachievement goal theory. Indeed, Ntoumanis (2001) used regression analysis to link task-17 \norientations to more self-determined forms of motivation, whilst ego-orientations were linked with 18 \nlow self-determined forms of motivation. This is consistent with both theoretical underpinning and 19 \nresearch findings, because the controlling features of an ego goal are proposed to undermine 20 \nautonomy, foster an external locus of causality, and undermine attempts at collaboration; whereas 21 \ntask goals facilitate autonomy, collaboration, and perceptions of competence (Brunel, 1999).  22 \nA problem that remains is that there is no comprehensive evidence pertaining to the variety of 23 \nbehaviours of key social agents that impact upon the perception of whether psychological needs 24 \nare satisfied or thwarted. Various papers and reviews (e.g., Deci, et al., 1991) offer insights but a), 25 \nthere are many conceptually similar variables proposed with no easy way of distinguishing 26 \nbetween them, and b), the level of specificity required for designing and delivering effective 27 \ninterventions is often lacking.  28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    10 \n \n  \nIn summary, the justification for the current study is based around a) the identified lack 1 \nof research studying motivational climates perceived by young athletes, defined both in terms 2 \nof age (<12 years old) and career progress (<3 years), b) recent theoretical developments 3 \nsuch as the introduction of approach-avoidance goals and the proposed inclusion of SDT 4 \nconstructs within motivational climate research, and c) the implications of these 5 \ndevelopments for current tools used in the measurement of motivational climate. 6 \nConsequently, the current research set out to identify the specific motivationally-relevant 7 \nbehaviours of coaches, parents and peers that are perceived to influence the motivation of 8 \nathletes at the beginning of their sporting careers.  9 \nMethod 10 \nParticipants 11 \nThe study obtained ethical clearance from the ethics committee of a British University. Eight 12 \nfocus groups were conducted containing 40 sport participants (19 females and 21 males), recruited 13 \nfrom 17 sports, with an age range of 7 years 6 months up to 11 years 4 months (Mean = 9 years 7 14 \nmonths, SD = 1 year 2 months). The participants were recruited from local schools by writing to the 15 \nhead-teacher, explaining the study, and requesting to interview school pupils who played sport in 16 \ntheir spare time, outside of school PE. If consent was granted, children who met these criteria were 17 \ntaken out of class and interviewed at the school site, one class at a time. Ability levels ranged from 18 \nabsolute beginners up to and including those with 2-3 years experience and the vast majority of 19 \nparticipants were competing in more than one sport. Using C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s (1999) model of career 20 \ndevelopment, all participants were considered to be career \u2018initiators\u2019 and met the following criteria: 21 \n1) Short career, usually less than 3 years, 2) Not specialised into, or committed to, one single sport, 22 \nand 3) Any talent or skills have not been formally recognised (e.g., not selected for any 23 \nrepresentative sides).  24 \nData collection: Procedure 25 \nA focus-group approach was chosen in order to maximise the experience within each group 26 \nand also to meet child-protection and ethical considerations. Groups were always mixed-gender and 27 \ndrawn from the same year-group (cf. Stewart & Shamdasani, 1990). Focus groups are proposed to 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    11 \n \n  \nbe highly appropriate in situations where the research is aiming to generate new ideas, language and 1 \napplications and they can also help to embolden young participants to offer their opinions 2 \n(Greenbaum, 1998). All focus groups were conducted on school premises by the first author and 3 \nlasted between 40 and 65mins. An interview guide was used which had been piloted with a 4 \nrepresentative sample of athletes from varying levels. The style of asking questions was adapted 5 \nfollowing this piloting to be more accessible and pictorial aids were also introduced to represent a 6 \ncoach, parents and team-mates (cf. Stewart & Shamdasani, 1990). Feedback was also sought from 7 \nprimary school teachers regarding the comprehension level required to understand the questions. All 8 \nFGIs were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The FGI began with a statement of what was 9 \nbeing studied and a brief explanation of the concept of motivation and situational goals. Following 10 \nthis, participants provided their names and ages for the tape and listed the sports they participated in 11 \noutside of school (and any attainments achieved). This process facilitated subsequent questions and 12 \ntranscription - it also acted to \u2018break the ice\u2019.  13 \nAfter this initial phase, the interview continued with questions intended to assess the 14 \ninfluences (positive and negative) of coaches, parents and peers on the main dimensions of 15 \nmotivated behaviour reported by Roberts (2001). These included effort, persistence, choosing 16 \nchallenging tasks, concentration, and enjoyment. Sample questions included: \u201cWhat things can your 17 \ncoach do, or say to make you really want to try hard in your sport, and never give up?\u201d, \u201cHow can 18 \nyour parents, either of them [make your enjoy your sport \/ focus you on learning new skills \/ help 19 \nyou to keep tying, even when you\u2019re struggling]?\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the people who are friends 20 \nplaying your sport. How can your team-mates make you want to try harder, and never give up?\u201d The 21 \ninterview finished with some summary questions such as: \u201cIf you could write a wish-list to your 22 \ncoach and say \u2018To make me try hard all the time, to make me really want to come back every week, 23 \nthis is how you should be\u2019; what sort of things would go on that list?\u201d and \u201cWhat are the most 24 \nimportant things people can do to make sure you try hard in\/enjoy your sport?\u201d. Participants were 25 \nalways encouraged to seek clarification if they did not understand or were unsure. The sections 26 \nrelating to coaches, parents and peers were asked in a counterbalanced order between interviews in 27 \nan attempt to alleviate any effects of fatigue or boredom. Additionally, when addressing the 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    12 \n \n  \ninfluence of coaches, participants were instructed to focus on their coaches during organised sport 1 \nand not their school teachers.  2 \nParticipants were allowed to respond freely and debates were encouraged when participants 3 \nhad different perspectives. If questions intended for later in the interview were discussed this was 4 \nnot prevented by the interviewer. Probes were included to facilitate deeper exploration and focus on 5 \nthemes and questions-of-interest that arose from previous interviews (see Data Analysis section). 6 \nThus, while the interview possessed structure, there was flexibility in how questions were asked and 7 \nfollowed up, allowing depth of exploration and better rapport. The interviewer had attended training 8 \nin child protection and made informal assessments of any potentially challenging reports, although 9 \nno further action was judged to be necessary in any instance.  10 \nData analysis 11 \nThe process of data analysis started after the first interview, with the interviewer reflecting on 12 \nthe responses given and sharing these reflections with the other researchers. As a result of such 13 \nprocesses, the data gathered became increasingly focused around emerging themes and questions. 14 \nAn eight-step procedure was adopted to prepare and analyse the qualitative data and to maximise the 15 \ntrustworthiness of the analysis: 1) transcribe FGIs verbatim (in total, yielding 220 pages of single 16 \nspaced text); 2) read and re-read transcripts for familiarisation (also listening to tapes); 3) divide 17 \nquotes into those concerning coaches, parents and peers; 4) perform a thorough inductive content 18 \nanalysis within each domain drawing from the basic premises of Grounded Theory (Strauss & 19 \nCorbin, 1998). This was performed using QSR N-Vivo7 software (QSR, 2002); 5) inter-rated 20 \nchecking was conducted wherein a random sample of 6 manuscripts was also coded by co-21 \nresearchers and colleagues and differences between these codings were considered during the initial 22 \ncoding of the remaining data. An inter-rater agreement of 82% was observed, which is relatively 23 \nhigh (e.g., 81% in Weiss, Smith & Theeboom, 1996). Additionally, the second and third authors 24 \nindependently checked the initial and focused codings, 6) internal and external member checking 25 \nwere carried out to assess the accuracy of manuscripts, interpretations and the relevance of the 26 \nresulting analysis. During the interview, member checking consisted of the researcher restating, 27 \nsummarizing, or paraphrasing the information received from respondents to ensure that what was 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    13 \n \n  \nheard was correct. Following data collection, a sample of transcripts were sent back to the 1 \nparticipating schools to check the accuracy with participants, and also findings were presented to a 2 \nnew set of participants, asking for commentary and incorporating these comments into the findings 3 \nwhere necessary; 7) an iterative consensus validation process was conducted with two members of 4 \nthe research team to ensure the integration of codings into particular categories made the most 5 \nanalytic sense. Members of the research team asked critical questions and encouraging the first 6 \nauthor to reflect during the different stages of the inquiry, and 8) a peer debrief was conducted with 7 \nthe remaining researchers throughout the analysis as well as in review of the final analysis.  8 \nThis structured use of multiple sources of data, investigators and theoretical viewpoints is 9 \nproposed to facilitate a triangulation of the subject matter which is less susceptible to individual bias 10 \n(Biddle et al., 2001). There were 769 initial codings and these were formed into 492 focused 11 \ncodings that were then used to sift through larger amounts of data. Within the inductive process, all 12 \nidentified codes represented the interpreted meanings of the athletes\u2019 responses. Some codes were 13 \ndirectly named after the participants\u2019 own words, whilst others were named after concepts existing 14 \nin the literature that were representative. In the latter case, processes of private reflection, consensus 15 \nvalidation and peer review were utilised to ensure that these codes and the categories they 16 \nrepresented were embodied in the data and not forced upon it (cf. Strauss & Corbin, 1998).  17 \nThe process of filling out emergent categories was assisted by constant comparison 18 \nprocedures, wherein initial codes were compared to more focused codes (already integrated into 19 \nemerging categories) and were either added to them or used eventually to develop new categories. 20 \nThis recursive coding of properties, interactions and contexts\/situations (\u2018processes\u2019) was carried out 21 \nuntil no new information about a category seemed to emerge (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). For the 22 \npurposes of this particular study, the analysis focused on motivationally relevant sources and forms 23 \nof perceived influence that were common across the range of participants (cf. Holt & Dunn, 2004).  24 \nResults 25 \nWith a view to highlighting the potential integration of coach, parent and peer influences, 26 \nTable 1 was constructed to highlight higher-order themes (HOTs) that showed strong 27 \ncorrespondence, and the results will be presented in a format matching this; listing congruent themes 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    14 \n \n  \nwhich related to all 3 social agents, then themes which showed similarities under any 2 social 1 \nagents, and finally the themes that emerged and appeared unique to one social agent. Where 2 \nquotations are provided, the participant\u2019s reference is given in the form [GENDER-AGE-SPORTS]. 3 \nCoach, parent and peer commonalities 4 \nThe concept of 'feedback'\/'evaluative communication\u2019 emerged separately in all three 5 \ndimensions of the analysis. Whilst in the coaching dimension, a more defined 'feedback' theme 6 \nemerged, the parent and peer dimensions produced slightly broader themes that were termed 7 \n'evaluative behaviours' or 'evaluative communications'. These HOTs have been grouped together in 8 \nthe presentation of findings in order to facilitate the integrated consideration of how multiple social 9 \nagents influence athlete motivation (see also Table 1). 10 \nOverall, both coaches and parents were found to influence athlete motivation either through 11 \nverbal feedback or behavioural reinforcement. In each instance, verbal feedback was divided into 12 \n'positive feedback', which was generally reported to be a positive influence on motivation, and 13 \n'negative feedback' which was generally thought to have a demotivating effect, and perhaps pertain 14 \nto avoidance-valenced goals, for example (regarding the coach): \u201cI mean you get worried if you 15 \nforget to do one of the things [criticisms]. You\u2019re trying so hard to do those things that it just goes 16 \nblank out of your mind\u201d [F10.8-SWIM\/DANCE]. However, one caveat to this was that one participant 17 \nreported an \u2018I\u2019ll show him!\u2019 reaction in response to criticism: \u201cProve him wrong yeah. Like, if he 18 \nsays \u2018You can\u2019t do it. These guys are so better than you\u2019, then you wanna prove him wrong\u201d [M8.4-19 \nSOCCER\/SWIM]. Within \u2018parent criticism\u2019, negative feedback was generally reported as relating to 20 \nnegative affective responses and the undermining of motivation, whereas constructive criticism was 21 \nlinked to the adoption of mastery and approach goals and was less associated with negative feelings 22 \nor cognitions.  23 \nParticipants reported, even at this young age, that coach feedback could convey ability beliefs (cf. 24 \nDweck, 1999) and although this was not referred to regarding parents within the focus groups, it is a 25 \npossibility worth entertaining. Specifically, labelling-summative comments (such as \u2018you\u2019re not very 26 \ngood at that\u2019) convey the message that the child\u2019s ability is fixed. In contrast, constructive-formative 27 \ncomments (for example \u2018if you just adjust your position you\u2019ll have a better chance\u2019) convey the 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    15 \n \n  \nmessage that the child\u2019s ability is incremental and can be improved with effort and\/or persistence. 1 \nFor example: 2 \nSummative feedback: Like say you\u2019ve gone wrong and they didn\u2019t tell you where you\u2019re 3 \ngoing wrong, you could sort of worry and think \u201cwell I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ve gone 4 \nwrong so I don\u2019t know how to make myself get better\u201d... ...They just said \u201cyou\u2019ve gone 5 \nwrong\u201d [F-10.3-DANCE\/BALLET] 6 \n \u2018Behavioural reinforcement\u2019 simply referred to the use of rewards and punishments to try and 7 \ninfluence the child\u2019s behaviour. Regarding parents, effort-contingent reinforcement (for example, 8 \nsweets or money for trying regardless of result) was reported in generally positive terms, whereas 9 \noutcome-contingent reinforcement (for example, sweets or money for winning or achieving a high 10 \nplace) was reported as having mixed influences, from increasing pressure (e.g., regarding parents: 11 \n\u201cIf it's quite a big reward, like a new Playstation game, and you like miss, you're like really upset 12 \nwith yourself\u2026 it might have been your only chance to get it. And you've missed it\u201d [M-9.3-13 \nSOCCER\/TENNIS\/CRICKET]) to potentially providing an added incentive. Within behavioural 14 \nreinforcement, coaches were reported to: 1) punish mistakes (which often related to negative affect, 15 \nfear and the adoption of avoidance goals), 2) punish unsporting behaviour, 3) reward normative 16 \nsuccess (which was reported as having mixed effects, particularly on the individuals not receiving 17 \nrewards) and 4) offer rewards for effort (which was generally reported to promote effort and 18 \nparticipation and encourage persistence); for example (regarding the coach): \u201cIf you like do 19 \nsomething a bit wrong, but you really tried, she says \u2018That was excellent\u2019 and \u2018That was really, 20 \nreally good\u2019, and she keeps saying things like \u2018Keep trying\u2019. But if you're not trying... she doesn't 21 \nsay anything\u201d [F10-SWIM\/ATHLETICS].  22 \n In contrast to coaches and parents, the HOT 'peer evaluative communication' was best 23 \nanalysed as a function of their chronological occurrence, and so were labelled \u2018immediate reactions 24 \nto mistakes\u2019 and \u2018post-hoc comments\u2019. \u2018Immediate reactions to mistakes\u2019 could include either 25 \n\u2018anger\u2019 or \u2018tolerance\u2019; with anger likely to induce avoidance motivation, negative affect and 26 \ninterpersonal conflict, whilst \u2018tolerance of mistakes\u2019 at least avoided these negative consequences 27 \nand was generally reported in positive terms. \u2018Post-hoc comments\u2019 contained: 1) \u2018praise and positive 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    16 \n \n  \nfeedback\u2019 and 2) \u2018criticism and negative feedback\u2019, which were similar in their content and 1 \nconsequences to the analogous coaching and parenting themes. In addition a theme emerged that 2 \nwas labelled: 3) \u2018discussing team selections\u2019, which related to the endorsement of normative 3 \ndefinitions of competence, for example:  4 \nI talk to my mates like \u201cOh I really want to get picked for this team... I don't think this person 5 \nshould be picked, and this person shouldn't be, because this person isn't very good, and this 6 \nperson is\u201d and we talk about who should get picked. [M-8.10-TENNIS\/SWIM] 7 \nCoach and parent commonalities 8 \n Leadership style: Both coaches and parents of young athletes are placed in a position of 9 \nstrong leadership due the young athlete's heavy dependence upon adults for both instruction and 10 \npragmatic support. As such, the leadership HOT in both dimensions related to the manner in which 11 \nthis leadership is undertaken. The central distinction was between a controlling\/autocratic style and 12 \nan autonomy supportive\/democratic style. The emergent categories within this dimension included 13 \n\u2018collaborative style' (e.g., regarding the coach: \u201cThey won\u2019t persuade you to be put in any position, 14 \nlike if you\u2019re really rubbish at goalkeeper then they won\u2019t persuade you to go in goal, they might ask 15 \nyou where you want to play\u201d[M8.4-SOCCER\/SWIM]), and \u2018controlling style\u2019 (e.g., regarding the coach; 16 \n\u201cWell they don\u2019t ask me where I want to go. Maxy [coach] says \u2018Back in defence\u2019, and I\u2019m like 17 \n\u2018Oh\u2019\u2026\u201d[M7.7-SOCCER\/RUGBY]). Within the coaching climate, 'maintaining discipline' was generally 18 \nvalued by participants because it meant disruptions were prevented and more could be taught during 19 \na session\/lesson, for example: \u201cI don't think he's strict enough\u2026 The other people are trying to 20 \nconcentrate, but then you get these like really naughty people who are trying to like mess up the 21 \nlesson... and he doesn't do anything!\u201d [F10.0-SWIM\/ATHLETICS] 22 \n Controlling style was further subdivided in each dimension, however the sub-categories 23 \nemerged differently for parents and coaches, perhaps as a function of the different roles they perform 24 \n(see Table 1).  25 \n Emotional and affective responses: This theme was separated from such themes as feedback 26 \nand evaluation as they did not always have an evaluative component, but reflected the tendency of 27 \nthe coach or parent to show negative affect, positive affect, or tolerance.. This was reported by 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    17 \n \n  \nparticipants as a determinant of their motivation\/goal adoption, as a function of the affective 1 \nresponses the child may anticipate at any given moment and the consequences they would expect. 2 \nWithin this HOT were three emergent categories common to both parents and coaches: \u2018propensity 3 \nfor anger\u2019 (e.g., \u201cThey can really hurt your feelings when they shout at you, I hate shouting\u201d [M8.0-4 \nSOCCER\/SWIM\/RUGBY]), \u2018positive affective style\u2019 (e.g., regarding the coach; \u201cHe laughs with you and 5 \nmakes you motivated and it\u2019s like he\u2019s a nice person it\u2019s just that he wants us to win he wants us to 6 \ndo better\u201d [M.10.6-SOCCER\/TENNIS]; regarding parents: \u201cThey're just like 'I'm so proud of you', and you 7 \nknow you've done something right. They always make you feel glad\u201d [M-9.3B-SWIM\/TENNIS\/SOCCER]) and 8 \n\u2018tolerance of failures\u2019 (e.g., \u201cLike they\u2019re not as hard really when you fail, they\u2019re a bit more easier\u201d 9 \n[M7.11-SOCCER\/SWIM]) and \u201cLike if you\u2026 say you keep on, can\u2019t doing it [sic] they don\u2019t shout at you\u201d 10 \n[M-7.11-SOCCER\/SWIM]).  11 \n Pre-performance motivating behaviours: This theme specifically represents the behaviours 12 \nundertaken in the period immediately before competitive performances, intended to motivate the 13 \nparticipants. The four main emergent categories were:  14 \n(a) \u2018encouraging effort and mastery\u2019: which further subdivided into \u2018improvement emphasis\u2019, 15 \nfor example: \u201cHe [coach] doesn\u2019t care about the results he just wants to help us get 16 \nimproving\u201d [M11.3-SOCCER\/RUNNING]; and \u2018encouraging participation\u2019, for example: \u201cThey say 17 \nlike, it doesn\u2019t matter where you come as long as you like do your personal best\u201d [M11.4-18 \nATHL\/SOCCER\/ BADMNTN]); 19 \n(b) \u2018encouraging rivalry and competition\u2019 (which further subdivided into \u2018building up 20 \nrivalries\u2019 and \u2018focus on winning\u2019),  21 \n(c) \u2018approach-based motivations\u2019 (which revolved around showing belief, building confidence 22 \nand highlighting desirable possibilities, for example: \u201cThey say, maybe [playing well] 23 \nthat\u2019ll put you in this place and you\u2019ve never been there before\u201d [M-8.0-SOCCER\/RUGBY\/SWIM].), 24 \nand: 25 \n(d) \u2018avoidance and negative motivations\u2019, which was specific to the coaching climate in this 26 \nanalysis. This theme was subdivided into \u2018avoidance goals\u2019 and \u2018emphasising negative 27 \nconsequences\u2019, for example: \u201cLike by saying \u2018oh we\u2019re gonna go to the bottom of the 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    18 \n \n  \nleague if we don\u2019t win the match\u2019. We was tempted to give up at some points [sic].\u201d [M8.4-1 \nSOCCER\/SWIM].  2 \nThemes unique to the coach 3 \nInstructional and pedagogic considerations: This HOT referred to the way the coach goes 4 \nabout the regular duties of coaching, such as teaching, planning and implementing drills, making 5 \nteam selections, placing participants into groups and much more. As can be seen in Table 1, this 6 \nHOT is made up of seven emergent categories; detailed below. 7 \n\u2018Equal treatment and perceived fairness\u2019, pertained to either preferential treatment of 8 \nparticipants (e.g., favouring athletes demonstrating normative ability or a family relationship by 9 \nsparing them punishments for bad behaviour), which was reported as undermining the motivation of 10 \nothers, or the equal treatment of the group, which was preferred by participants.  11 \n\u2018One-to-one coaching\u2019 related to the time spent by coaches giving instruction, attention, 12 \nevaluation and feedback individually. This coaching behaviour was construed as having a very 13 \npositive influence on motivation, for example:  14 \nIf you try and do something hard, they just come to you and help you... \u2026And that helps me 15 \nfeel better with my technique because they're just focussing on me and helping me. [F-9.3-16 \nGYMNAST\/TENNIS] 17 \n\u2018Grouping of athletes\u2019 emerged as an important theme, however, as opposed to being 18 \nstrongly related to any goal adoption, or even being generally positive or negative, the issue of 19 \nheterogeneous versus homogeneous groupings was raised and explored without being consistently 20 \nlinked to any motivational outcome or achievement goal.  21 \n  \u2018Task design\u2019 related to all aspects of the drills and practices that the coach organises during 22 \ntheir practice sessions. Fundamentally, the very nature of the tasks that the participants undertake 23 \nwas reported as having an influence on their motivation. Competitive tasks such as short 24 \ncompetitions at the end of practice were seen as motivating and as good practice for real 25 \ncompetition. This is in contrast to the pre-competition theme of \u2018promoting competition and rivalry\u2019 26 \nwhich was generally seen as pressurising and negative. In addition, highly competitive practice 27 \nsessions were not discussed, only small competitions at the end of practice. This may be consistent 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    19 \n \n  \nwith the increased focus on skill development at this young age. \u2018Variety and fun\u2019 was an important 1 \naspect of task design, with a general agreement that a variety of fun tasks maintains good motivation 2 \nthroughout training sessions, for example \u201cAnd they try to make it fun for you so you learn what 3 \nthey\u2019re saying and you have fun at the same time\u201d [M9.6-TAE-KWON-DO\/SOCCER\/SWIMMING]. In contrast, 4 \n\u2018repetitive drills emphasising a single skill\u2019 were perceived as either boring, or as creating pressure 5 \nto execute the skill perfectly in subsequent attempts, for example: \u201cIf they're like concentrating on 6 \none thing, and saying 'You've got to do this thing, otherwise you can't be in', and you'll think about 7 \nthat loads, and forget all about your technique\u201d [M-8.10-TENNIS\/SWIM]. Finally, it was perceived to be 8 \nimportant that tasks, where possible, were at an optimal level to challenge the participants; not too 9 \neasy and not too difficult.  10 \nSelection was a contentious and important issue even at this young age, with participants 11 \ngenerally focussing on the tendency of coaches to use selection as an incentive by creating 12 \ncompetition for places and offering \u2018promotion\u2019 to higher groups for normatively more able athletes. 13 \nCompetition for places was generally seen as having a negative impact on motivation, except by 14 \nthose who were consistently selected.  15 \n\u2018Evaluation criteria\u2019 emerged as a theme relating to how athletes feel they are evaluated by 16 \ntheir coach and was separated from feedback, wherein the outcome of the evaluation would be 17 \ncommunicated to the athlete. It seemed that athletes could infer how they were being evaluated 18 \nwithout necessarily receiving feedback, and this was also reported to influence motivation. Coaches 19 \nwho generally emphasise effort, improvement and good skills were inferred to evaluate this way: 20 \n\u201cIt\u2019s what they say because like, my Tae-kwon-do teacher he says like at the end of the day if 21 \nyou\u2019ve done your best then that\u2019s all that matters\u201d [M-9.6-TAE-KWON-DO\/SOCCER\/SWIM]. In contrast, 22 \ncoaches could be seen to evaluate normatively if they focused on results and outcomes: \u201cThe 23 \nmanager, doesn\u2019t care about good play, all he wants is the result\u201d [M11.3-SOCCER\/RUNNING]. Finally, one 24 \npotentially novel finding was that participants in this study were very sensitive to being evaluated by 25 \ncoaches seeking to \u2018fault-find\u2019. This was related to fear-of-failure and avoidance motivation, for 26 \nexample:  27 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    20 \n \n  \nThere\u2019s loads and loads of black-belts in the room.

[M-9.6-TAE-KWON-DO\/SOCCER\/SWIM]  4 \nThemes unique to parents 5 \nParent support and facilitation: This HOT referred to the supportive role carried out by 6 \nparents in transporting their children to training and competitions, purchasing equipment, and 7 \noffering \u2018moral support\u2019 from the sidelines. Within \u2018parent support and facilitation\u2019 were the 8 \nemergent categories of \u2018material and emotional support\u2019, \u2018unconditional support\u2019 and \u2018watching-9 \nspectating\u2019; each of these is exemplified below:  10 \nMaterial and emotional support: [Talking about parents] If you\u2019ve had like a really tough day 11 \nat work and you came back and your child wanted to go to swimming practice or anything and 12 \nyou couldn\u2019t be bothered to go, you\u2019ve still got to take the child because they might actually 13 \nturn out to be an Olympic swimmer\u2026 \u2026 your parents have got to believe in you. [M11.4- 14 \nSOCCER\/ BADMNTN] 15 \nWatching-spectating: Like if you\u2019re in a match, a netball match or badminton match, they\u2019ll 16 \ncome along and support you, which makes you want to do better and make us win. 17 \n[F11-DANCE\/SWIM\/ATHL] 18 \nParent play-and-teach behaviours: This HOT described the activities and behaviours 19 \nundertaken by parents away from the context of organised sport, aimed at developing or improving 20 \nthe child\u2019s competence. It seemed that while coaches actively plan sessions and teach skills, the role 21 \nof parents was to facilitate practice and play, and join in with play activities in order to help the child 22 \ndevelop. The emergent categories were entitled: \u2018facilitation of practice\u2019 (which was further 23 \nsubdivided into \u2018encouraging practice\u2019 and \u2018garden play\u2019), \u2018balance of instruction and practice\/play\u2019, 24 \nwherein children preferred to receive less instruction from parents and instead simply play, and 25 \n\u2018conflicting advice to the coach\u2019, wherein offering conflicting advice to the coach was reported as 26 \nconfusing, overloading, and detrimental to motivation. \u2018Encouraging practice\u2019 and \u2018Garden play\u2019 27 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    21 \n \n  \nwere two particularly strong themes that seemed to be highly representative of the parenting role at 1 \nthis stage of sporting development:  2 \nEncouraging practice: They're always like \u201cPractice your gymnastics now, practice your 3 \ntennis now\u201d, and then you get better in your next lesson, because they told you to practice\u2026 4 \n...you can do something that you couldn't do before. [F9.3-GYMNASTICS\/TENNIS].  5 \n\u2018Garden play\u2019: And then you like bring them into the back garden and show them and they\u2019ll 6 \nsay \u201cYeah brilliant that\u2019s really good\u201d and you get more motivated and you use it in the game 7 \nas well. [M-11.3-SOCCER\/RUNNING] 8 \nAnd: They just say - like quickly - how you can do it, and then, if you do it like once or twice, 9 \nand then you realise that you can do it really easily. And, like, they keep doing that and you 10 \nkeep getting better at different things. [M-8.9-TENNIS\/SOCCER\/CRICKET\/RUGBY] 11 \nThemes unique to peers 12 \n Peer relationships and social interactions: Within this HOT, the emergent categories were 13 \nlabelled \u2018linking competence to social outcomes\u2019 (e.g., \u201cSaying mean things [like]... um, \u201cYou\u2019re 14 \nin the wrong group\u201d\u2026and \u201cThat\u2019s rubbish! You\u2019re not being my friend any more\u201d [F-7.5-15 \nDANCE\/SWIM]), \u2018separating competence from social outcomes\u2019 \u2013 wherein no link was made between 16 \nskill-level, normative ability or sporting outcomes and friendship, \u2018friendship and affiliation\u2019 \u2013 17 \nwhich was reported as a key motivating factor, and \u2018group identity and perceived belonging\u2019, 18 \nwhich was also reported as a key motivating factor..  19 \n By implying that poor performance may have implications for making or losing friends, 20 \npeers are able to endorse and promote a definition of competence, which may then impact on the 21 \nadoption of goals. In contrast, by keeping social outcomes separate and remaining friends 22 \nregardless of competence, this link would not be created.  23 \nCompetition amongst peers: This HOT reflects any behaviour that peers may exhibit in 24 \nperformance situations (chiefly training and competing) that were perceived to be promoting 25 \nnormative evaluations of competence. The emergent categories within this theme were labelled: 26 \n\u2018boasting and pride\u2019, \u2018negative reactions to defeat\u2019, \u2018peers playing well\u2019, \u2018rivalry and conflict\u2019 and 27 \n\u2018competitive behaviours\u2019. 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    22 \n \n  \n \u2018Boasting and pride\u2019 represented any attempts by athletes to draw attention to their 1 \nnormative success, often by mocking those they have beaten. The effects described varied from 2 \nundermining motivation (e.g., \u201cThat makes you think \u2018Oh why am I bothering then?\u2019\u201d [F11-3 \nDANCE\/SWIM\/ATHLETICS], to also include provoking increased effort (e.g., \u201cIt could make you feel 4 \nangry, or it could make you feel 'I'm going to be as good as you' and then try harder.\u201d [F-9.3-5 \nGYMNAST\/TENNIS]). \u2018Negative reactions to defeat\u2019 included anger, criticism and the withdrawal of 6 \nfriendship, which seemed to prompt athletes to infer competitiveness in peers. \u2018Peers playing well\u2019 7 \nrelated to when team-mates or opponents execute good skills. The participants in the following 8 \nexample described the effect as one of pressurising instead of inspiring or leading-by-example 9 \n(described elsewhere): \u201cYeah because like in swimming [relay] like if you\u2019re the last one to go 10 \nand like all your team-mates have made you be in front then they\u2019re like depending on you and 11 \nthat makes you feel like\u2026 pressure\u201d [F-11- TENNIS\/ BADMNTN\/SWIM]. Such a theme may have very 12 \ndifferent effects depending on the nature of the sport, be it an interactive, co-active or independent 13 \nsport. This highlights the heavy interdependence of constructs in determining motivational 14 \noutcomes. \u2018Rivalry and conflict\u2019 was similar to \u2018boasting and pride\u2019 but could occur between peers 15 \nat any time and did not necessarily originate from a normatively more able athlete towards those 16 \nthey had defeated. Fundamentally, the theme revolves around normative comparisons and often 17 \nattempting to gain some advantage by upsetting an opponent. For example:  18 \nSometimes like if you fall out with them a bit and they say like \u2018I bet you can\u2019t do it\u2019 then 19 \nthat can make you want to try hard and go and do it more, to prove them wrong\u2026 \u2026Even if 20 \nyou\u2019re like best of friends it can turn to rivalry [M11.4-ATHL\/SOCCER\/BADMNTN].  21 \nOnce again, the effects of these behaviours could equally undermine and\/or increase 22 \nmotivation, provoke normative or mastery definitions of competence, and induce approach or 23 \navoidance goal adoptions.  24 \nPeer collaboration and altruistic behaviours: This HOT reflects any behaviours that peers 25 \nmay exhibit in performance situations (training and competing) that increased the likelihood of 26 \ncollaboration or increased the chances of another peer performing well or improving. The emergent 27 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    23 \n \n  \ncategories in this theme were labelled: \u2018building confidence in each other\u2019, \u2018emotional and moral 1 \nsupport\u2019, \u2018collaborative play and learning\u2019, \u2018emphasising effort\u2019 and \u2018encouraging practice\u2019.  2 \n\u2018Building confidence in each other\u2019 was generally a pre-performance behaviour, and involved 3 \nmaking statements such as \u2018we believe in you\u2019 and \u2018you can do it\u2019. The reported effects ranged 4 \nfrom increased confidence and shifts towards approach goals, to also include feeling pressurised. It 5 \nwas also generally perceived to be an act of kindness and friendship.  6 \n \u2018Emotional and moral support\u2019 referred to behaviours such as clapping, pat-on-the-back and 7 \nverbal persuasion to keep each other\u2019s \u2018heads up\u2019 and was included in this category due to its 8 \ntendency to occur in performance situations more than other contexts. These were also perceived 9 \nas acts of friendship and quite often as having a positive influence on motivation. \u2018Emphasising 10 \neffort\u2019 (e.g., \u201cThey go 'just try your best, even if you miss, it doesn't really matter'\u201d [M-9.3-11 \nSOCCER\/TENNIS\/CRICKET] and \u2018encouraging practice, both emerged and showed good consistency with 12 \nsimilar themes identified elsewhere (see discussion). \u2018Collaborative play and learning\u2019 referred to 13 \nacts of collaboration not only in order to improve skill or understanding (e.g., \u201cShowing you how 14 \nto do it. Like with my friend she just helped me learn, and showed me how to do things, and then 15 \nin the end, I just thought I'd be really good at it\u201d [F-9.3-GYMNAST\/TENNIS]), but also during matches and 16 \ncompetitions (e.g., \u201cBecause I know that like they want to win, and so they will pass to me, they're 17 \nnot just gonna shoot and miss. They're going to pass to someone in a better position than 18 \nthemselves\u201d [M-9.3-SOCCER\/TENNIS\/CRICKET]). 19 \nGeneral discussion 20 \nThis study set out to produce a detailed description of the motivationally-relevant behaviours 21 \nof coaches, parents and peers in early-career sport performers. Three key objectives drove this 22 \nresearch: 1) an interest in appraising the relevance and applicability of \u2018motivational climate\u2019 to 23 \nathletes under 12 years of age, 2) consideration to the broadness of the concept of \u2018motivational 24 \nclimate\u2019 by using an inductive approach to reveal relevant motivational constructs that may currently 25 \nlie beyond the lens of dichotomous framework of achievement goals (Ames, 1992), and 3) a deeper 26 \nunderstanding of the potentially separate but also integrated motivational roles of coaches, parents 27 \nand peers at this early athletic stage. 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    24 \n \n  \nThe focus groups yielded highly pertinent and rich data offering a comprehensive 1 \nrepresentation of the specific behaviours by which key social agents are reported to influence the 2 \nmotivation of young athletes. The results serve to reinforce the importance of studying \u2018motivational 3 \nclimate\u2019 at this developmental stage and offer insights into how coach-, parent- and peer-climate 4 \ninterventions might be extended in terms of existing practical content (e.g., Smith, Smoll & 5 \nCumming, 2007) .  6 \nFurther, although an open-minded, inductive approach was purposefully pursued, several of 7 \nthe emerging themes and concepts resonated very clearly with the range of motivational theories 8 \nreviewed earlier. For example, the HOT 'coach instruction and pedagogic considerations' 9 \ndemonstrated consistency with Ames' TARGET framework, as well as offering potentially fruitful 10 \nadditions. For example, the theme of coach 'evaluation criteria' contained references to both mastery-11 \nbased and normative evaluations, as-well-as 'fault finding'. Themes associated with 'pre-performance 12 \nmotivating behaviours', from both parents and coaches, showed consistencies with the trichotomous 13 \nor 2x2 models (Elliot & McGregor, 2001), whilst the HOTs of 'leadership style' and 'emotional 14 \nresponses' were congruent with aspects of autonomy support and relatedness support, within SDT 15 \n(Deci & Ryan, 2000). Components of the peer climate showed similarities to those cited in Vazou et 16 \nal. (2005) as well as recognisable links to social goals (cf. Urdan & Maehr, 995; Wentzel, 1993).  17 \nOverall, at this early age, it appears that coaches and parents have a relatively strong influence 18 \non athlete motivation, perhaps due to their singular positions of authority. Their influences are also 19 \ncomparable in nature, which is proposed to be a function of the similar roles they perform (for 20 \nexample: where their roles differ, their influences differ too). Peer influences appeared to be 21 \nqualitatively very different to coaches and parents, and perhaps less consistent, as a function of the 22 \nsheer number and variability of peer relationships. This inconsistent and disparate influence of peers 23 \nmight lead to the proposition that, relative to parents and coaches, the influence of peers on 24 \nmotivation in young athletes at this specific stage may be less significant.  25 \n Whilst there were very few indications of interactional overlaps between social agents (e.g., 26 \nparents \u2018conflicting information to the coach\u2019 was the only sub-category to clearly suggest the 27 \nimportance of collaboration between social agents), there were interesting commonalities that 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    25 \n \n  \nemerged between agents. Parents and coaches showed the strongest similarities, with leadership 1 \nstyle, evaluation\/feedback, emotional and affective responses, and pre-performance motivating 2 \nbehaviours emerging in both dimensions. For example, the evaluation\/feedback aspects of coaching 3 \nand parenting were quite comparable, with both verbal feedback and behavioural reinforcement 4 \nfiguring strongly. As was the case with peer evaluative communications, the clearest divide was 5 \nbetween positive and negative evaluations, with fewer references to normative-versus-mastery 6 \ndefinitions of competence. The strong similarities between the coach and parent dimensions are 7 \nmost likely to reflect the highly comparable positions of leadership and responsibility they hold 8 \nwhen dealing with such young athletes. Not only are coaches and parents likely to be the key 9 \ndecision makers during the young athlete's participation (determining drills, games, practice time, 10 \noffering lifts, buying equipment), they are also charged with ensuring the athlete's safety, as well as 11 \n(most likely) being held in high esteem by the athlete.  12 \nIn contrast to the peers\u2019 dimension, and also to older athletes, these role-related aspects appear 13 \nto be pivotal in establishing the motivationally-relevant behaviours that these agents can perform, as 14 \nwell as the likely perception and impact of these behaviours. Ongoing research comparing young 15 \nathletes with older and 'elite' populations is likely to expand on these role-related differences and 16 \nresearch examining the changing roles, relationships, and power-relations across the athletic career 17 \nis recommended on the basis of these findings.  18 \nBeyond competence motivation \u2013 autonomy and relatedness in sport 19 \n The conceptualisation of climate is determined heavily by whether one considers sport to be 20 \na context where competence goals dominate (cf. Roberts, 2001), or whether one acknowledges that 21 \nparticipation in sport may, at any time, involve goals pertaining to other motivational constructs such 22 \nas relatedness and autonomy. Several recent papers have argued that sport does encompass the 23 \npursuits of competence, autonomy and relatedness alike (e.g., Allen & Hodge, 2006; Mageau & 24 \nVallerand, 2003). Despite these arguments having never been applied to the motivational climate of 25 \n7-11 year olds, the current findings provide evidence that all three of the constructs suggested in 26 \nDeci and Ryan\u2019s (2000) SDT are important in determining the motivation of very young athletes.  27 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    26 \n \n  \n Among coaches and parents, supporting autonomy could be evidenced through collaborative 1 \nleadership styles (or threatening a child\u2019s autonomy needs with autocratic leadership styles), whilst 2 \nthe supporting of relatedness was evidenced by facilitating the formation of friendships and the 3 \nestablishing of group identities. Among peers, 'friendship and affiliation' and 'group identity and 4 \nbelonging' bear a strong resemblance to the social motivations identified by Allen (2006) and 5 \nUllrich-French and Smith (2006); whilst the linking (or not) of competence to social outcomes is an 6 \ninteresting finding amongst participants at such a young age, although it is consistent with findings 7 \nelsewhere (e.g., Evans & Roberts, 1987; Skinner & Piek, 2001). One area worthy of future research 8 \nwas the apparent cross-over between these domains, such that relatedness could be used to 9 \nincentivise a competence goal, or autonomy supportive behaviour might contribute to an improved 10 \nrelationship (cf. Gurland & Grolnick, 2005). Further research into these interactive effects is likely 11 \nto improve our overall understanding of the social motivational processes that are active within the 12 \nsporting milieu. Such research could perhaps build on similar work conducted in academic 13 \nmotivation (e.g., Wentzel, 1993; Wentzel & Wigfield, 1998) which has shown that high-achievers 14 \nfrequently pursue both academic and social goals, whereas lower achievers display a unique 15 \n\u201cunwillingness to try to conform to the social and normative standards of the classroom\u201d (1998, p. 16 \n162). Emerging research in sport has found links between quality of friendship and peer acceptance 17 \nwith enjoyment and perceived competence (e.g., Allen, 2006; Ullrich-French & Smith, 2006).  18 \nIn sum, the experiences of these young athletes spoke not only to the significance of 19 \nperformance-versus-mastery definitions of competence, and approach-versus-avoidance valences, 20 \nbut also to the social goals and autonomy goals that may be supported and endorsed  21 \n(or undermined and threatened) by key social agents across a variety of contexts and situations. This 22 \nultimately led to themes pertaining to contexts and situations. 23 \nThroughout the findings of this study, single behaviours (and themes) from coaches, parents and 24 \npeers were related to various, and sometimes conflicting, motivational impacts. For example, 25 \ndepending on the respondent, the source and the context; negative feedback was reported as 26 \nproducing reduced motivation, avoidance-based motivation, improvement and mastery, 27 \nanger\/frustration, damaging relationships, \u2018being honest\u2019 and even being controlling (undermining 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    27 \n \n  \nautonomy). This suggests that the relationship between the behaviours of social agents and their 1 \nimpact on motivation is likely to be moderated by a number of contextual and interpersonal 2 \nfactors. Moreover, a persistent and dominant theme across the analysis was that of 'positivity' 3 \ni.e., positive feedback, positive affective responses, positive pre-competition talks (pep-talks), 4 \nencouragement, collaboration\/support and fun (e.g., in training) were consistently and 5 \npositively linked with athlete motivation, regardless of the social agent or context. Among 6 \nyoung participants commencing their athletic careers, considerations of positivity should 7 \narguably be central, even above technical proficiency or 'getting noticed' (e.g., by scouts), if we 8 \nwish to promote enjoyment and continued participation. 9 \nLimitations 10 \n It is important to remain cognisant that a 'detailed description' is all the study set out to 11 \nachieve and any reference to motivational outcomes such as goal adoptions, affective, 12 \ncognitive and behavioural responses must be interpreted cautiously due to the qualitative nature 13 \nof the investigation. Other limitations of the study include the young age of some of the 14 \nparticipants, which may have influenced their ability to recall and articulate their experiences 15 \neffectively and, equally, the use of focus groups may have introduced limitations such as social 16 \ndesirability, perhaps preventing the participants from being openly critical of coaches, parents 17 \nor peers. Whilst the quality and depth of the responses provided would suggest these were not 18 \nserious problems, they must be considered in evaluating the findings of the study. It was also 19 \nimpossible to establish the relative impact of each social agent in the current qualitative study, 20 \nalthough the findings should contribute to future research that may address this issue. 21 \nRecommendations and implications 22 \nWhilst appropriately acknowledging the concerns of Duda and Whitehead (1998) related to 23 \nthe range of questionnaires assessing motivational climate, the specific age group concerned, as-24 \nwell-as the relevance of other constructs, suggest that the development of a broader measure or 25 \nprocedure is essential in order to progress our understanding of how the social environment shapes 26 \nthe motivation of young sport performers. Such a measure may help to determine the relative 27 \nimportance of each social agent, which has so far been difficult to establish. It may also enable 28 \nMotivational climate in young sports performers    28 \n \n  \nresearchers to examine the effects of apparently contradictory behaviours between coaches, parents 1 \nand peers and find some way of modelling how these multiple variables determine children\u2019s 2 \nmotivation in sport. The data-driven approach in the current research cautions against the influence 3 \nof having a single dominant framework or theory driving the developing model of motivational 4 \nclimate 5 \nFrom the perspective of applied intervention research, this study encourages practitioners and 6 \nacademics to devote time to studying themes and behaviours across social agents in a manner that 7 \nwill enhance the content of educational programmes. At one level, this includes offering appropriate 8 \ninsights into adaptive and maladaptive contextually relevant behaviours to coaches and parents. A 9 \nsecond level of intervention lies in educating coaches and parents about the effective management of 10 \npeers (in their sessions) and peer responses to the young child-athlete. A third level may also include 11 \nworking directly with the child-athlete and his\/her peers on the development of an effective peer 12 \nclimate (e.g. what makes a good teammate, who makes you want to try hard and improve?). Recent 13 \nand successful intervention work using the dichotomous model of motivational climate has focused 14 \non the Mastery Approach to Coaching (MAC - Smith, Smoll & Cumming, 2007) to enhancing 15 \nathlete development. This intervention utilises a coach behaviour\/education workshop approach, 16 \nwhereas the results here suggest the potential benefits and value of a wider and multi-level (multi-17 \nagent) programme. 18 \nIn conclusion, the results from the current study attest to the multifaceted influence of 19 \ncoaches, parents and peers on the motivation of early-career sports participants. Moreover, we 20 \nsuggest that a data-driven approach to conducting future studies of motivational climate holds 21 \npromise in the light of recent developments within the motivation literature.22 \n       Motivational climate in young sports performers \n 29 \nReferences 1 \nAllen, J.B.
