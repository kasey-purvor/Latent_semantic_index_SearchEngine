Introduction \nAnalysis of structural features (folds, faults, tectonic fabrics, stratification) preserved \nin subglacially and proglacially deformed sediments can provide important \ninformation characteristic of each type of glacier-induced deformation (e.g. McCarroll \n 1\nand Rijsdijk, 2003). In particular, the application of field and laboratory techniques \nroutinely used by structural geologists can result in a systematic approach to \ninvestigation of complex polydeformed glacigenic sequences (e.g. Gijssel, 1986; van \nder Wateren, 1986; Phillips et al., 2002). This has led to a deeper understanding of \ntectonostratigraphical sequences and glacier-induced stresses responsible for their \ndevelopment (e.g. Berthelsen, 1978; Pedersen, 1993) than is possible from field \nobservations alone. Research on glacitectonic structures also provides information on, \nand allows elucidation of, the nature of ice-marginal sedimentation and dynamics \nduring glacial cycles (e.g. van der Wateren, 1986, 1995; Croot, 1988: Aber et al., \n1989; Benn and Evans, 1993; Harris et al., 1997; Evans et al; 1999; Phillips et al., \n2002; Hiemstra et al., 2005). \n \nMicromorphological analysis is increasingly being used as a principal tool for \ndistinguishing between subglacial and proglacial deformation and, in particular, \nbetween diamictons deposited in each environment (e.g. van der Meer et al., 2003; \nMenzies et al., 2006). The importance of its role increases where data from exposures \nis sparse such as in studies based on borehole cores (e.g. Carr et al., 2000, 2006). \nAnalysis of thin sections in geological structural and metamorphic studies is a proven \nand well-established technique, providing a wealth of data on the geometry and \nkinematics of deformation. (see Bell and Rubenach, 1983; Vernon, 1989; Passchier \nand Trouw, 1996 and references therein). In contrast, the application of \nmicromorphology to the interpretation of microstructures developed during subglacial \nand proglacial deformation is a relatively recent innovation (van der Meer and Laban, \n1990; van der Meer et al., 1992, 1994; van der Meer, 1993; van der Meer and Warren, \n1997; Menzies, 2000; Phillips and Auton, 2000; van der Wateren et al., 2000; Khatwa \nand Tulaczyk, 2001; Hart and Rose, 2001; Hiemstra and Rijsdijk, 2003; van der Meer \net al., 2003; Menzies et al., 2006). The detailed analysis of thin sections is being used \nwith increasing success to aid our understanding of both progressive and polyphase \ndeformation of glacigenic sequences (e.g. van der Wateren, 1995; Phillips and Auton, \n2000; van der Wateren et al., 2000). The role played by water during deformation is \nalso increasingly being recognised (Boulton et al., 1974; Boulton, G.S. and Caban, P. \n1995; Hiemstra and van der Meer, 1997; Rijsdijk et al., 1999; van der Meer et al., \n1999; Phillips and Auton, 2000; Boulton et al., 2001; Khatwa and Tulaczyk, 2001; \nPhillips, 2006; Baroni and Fasano, 2006). \n 2\n This paper synthesises the results of field observations, sedimentological analyses and \nmicromorphological studies from five sites from across Scotland. Its primary aims \nwere: \n\u2022 To establish some fundamental principles on how to approach \nmicromorphological analysis of deformed glacigenic sequences; \n\u2022 To critically evaluate micromorphology as a tool for distinguishing \nbetween the style of deformation in subglacial and proglacial settings; \n\u2022 To unravel the complex deformation histories of polydeformed \nglacigenic sequences and relate the glacitectonic events to local \npatterns of ice movement. \nAs the work progressed, a fourth aim emerged; to evaluate the role of water in \ninfluencing the style, pervasiveness and intensity of deformation, and the preservation \npotential of microstructures. \n \n1.1. The sites \nThe multidisciplinary studies have focused on subglacially deformed glaciolacustrine \nsediments and diamictons exposed at Raitts Burn in Strathspey and at Coire Mhic-sith \nnear Drumochter; proglacially deformed glaciolacustrine\/deltaic sediments from Glen \nLuibeg in the Cairngorm Mountains; subglacially deformed sands and an overlying \ndiamicton from Plumpe Farm, near Gretna; and finally subglacial and proglacial \ndeformed deltaic sandy sediments and associated diamictons from Drumbeg Quarry, \nnear Drymen (Fig. 1). Micromorphological analysis has aided in the unravelling of the \ncomplex deformation histories recorded by these deposits and related these \nglacitectonic events to the local patterns of ice movement. The role of water as a \nfactor controlling the style and intensity of deformation has also been investigated. \nThe results of these Scottish studies are used to critically evaluate the potential for \nusing micromorphological analysis to discriminate between subglacially and \nproglacially deformed sediments.  \n \n2. Sample collection and analytical technique \nIt is critical that correctly orientated samples are collected so that kinematic indicators \n(Choukroune et al., 1987; Passchier and Trouw, 1996; van der Wateren et al., 2000), \n 3\nsuch as the sense of asymmetry of folds, fabrics and boudins, as well as the sense of \ndisplacement faults, can be used to provide information on the stress regime active \nduring deformation and local ice movement directions, as well as allow comparison \nwith macroscopic fabric measurements. It is important that the orientation of the \nsamples, relative to the presumed directions of ice advance and retreat be established. \nOnly samples orientated parallel to the principal direction of ice movement will \nexhibit the most complete record of deformation and its intensity. \n \nPrior to sampling the sedimentary sequences were logged and the macro-scale \ncharacteristics of the sequence (e.g. geometry of the units, lithology, macroscopic \ndeformation structures....etc) were described in detail. Orientated samples of the \nglacigenic sediments were collected from Raitts Burn (3 samples), Coire Mhic-sith (3 \nsamples), Glen Luibeg (2 samples), Plumpe Farm (4 samples) and Drumbeg Quarry \n(7 samples). Individual samples were collected using 10 cm square, aluminium \nkubiena tins, which were either cut or pushed into the face of each exposure in order \nto limit sample disturbance. The geographical position, orientation relative to \nmagnetic north, depth and way-up of the sample were marked on the outside of the tin \nduring collection. Each sample was then removed from the face, sealed in two plastic \nbags, and then stored in a cold store to prevent the material from drying out prior to \nsample preparation.  \n \nSample preparation (total time c. 10 months) involved the initial replacement of pore-\nwater by acetone, which was then progressively replaced by a resin and allowed to \ncure. Large format orientated thin sections were taken from the centre of each of the \nprepared samples. Each thin section was cut orthogonal to the main deformation \nstructures evident from the field investigation, thus avoiding artefacts associated with \nsample collection. The thin sections were examined using a standard Zeiss \npetrological microscope and Zeiss projector, the latter allowing detailed study of the \nrange of microstructures at very low magnification. The terminology used to describe \nthe various microtextures developed within these sediments in general follows that \nproposed by van der Meer (1987, 1993) and Menzies (2000). Successive generations \nof small-scale fabrics (S1, S2\u2026\u2026Sn), folds (F1, F2\u2026..Fn) and faults and their \ninterrelationships are, typically, more clearly observed in thin section that at outcrop \ncan be used to understand the deformation histories recorded by deformed glacigenic \n 4\nsequences. The various generations of deformation structures are distinguished by the \nnomenclature normally used in structural geological studies (e.g. S1 earliest fabric to \nSn latest) (cf. Phillips and Auton, 2000).  \n \n3. Subglacially deformed glaciolacustrine sediments and diamictons  \n \n3.1 Raitts Burn, Strathspey  \nGlacial deposits exposed in Raitts Burn [National Grid Reference NH 780 041], \nStrathspey (Fig. 1) include deformed rhythmically laminated, glaciolacustrine fine-\ngrained sediments, interbedded with ice-proximal diamictons and gravels (Fig. 2). \nThe Quaternary geology and geomorphology of Raitts Burn are summarised here; a \nmore detailed description is presented in Phillips and Auton (2000). The main \nregional ice movement direction in Strathspey was towards the northeast (Young, \n1978; Auton, 1998). The glaciolacustrine sediments were deposited within a small \nlake impounded by ice at the mouth of the valley of Raitts Burn. They are overlain by \na sandy diamicton (or \u2018tectomict\u2019 of Menzies et al., 2006) that forms moraines, which \nare dissected by arcuate glacial drainage channels. The moraines formed at successive \nstill-stand positions of a southerly retreating ice margin.  \n \nThe poorly stratified, clast-supported, matrix-rich boulder and cobble gravel (Unit I, \nFig. 2) at the base of the sequence is interpreted as an ice-proximal debris-flow or fan \ndeposit, laid down during the initial deglaciation of the immediate Raitts Burn area \n(Phillips and Auton, 2000). The overlying rhythmically laminated silts and clays with \noccasional thin sandy interbeds (Unit II; Fig. 2) were all deposited in the ice-dammed \nlake. The upper most unit (Unit III; Fig. 2) comprises thick, weakly stratified sandy \ndiamicton forming a push moraine. The intensity of deformation recorded by the \nlacustrine sediments increases upwards through the sequence; from localised small-\nscale, normal faulting (northeast to southwest-trending) near the base, to more \npervasive folding, thrusting and normal and reverse faulting higher in the sequence. \nThese structures yield an overall north to northwest-directed sense of movement. \nReverse faults that are developed within the upper part of the lacustrine sequence also \ndeform the base of the overlying diamicton (Fig. 2). These faults are lined with \nlaminated, normally graded fine-grained sand and silt that was deposited by water \nflowing along these structures. \n 5\n 3.2. Micromorphology  \nThe micromorphology of the glaciolacustrine sediments exposed at Raitts Burn has \nbeen described in detail by Phillips and Auton (2000) and is, therefore, only \nsummarised here. Three orientated large format thin sections (S98555; S98557; \nS98556) taken at different levels within Unit II (Fig. 2) reveal a systematic change in \nthe style and intensity of deformation upward through the sequence, confirming \nmacroscopic field observations. Present throughout is a locally well-developed, \nbedding-parallel plasmic fabric (S1) which is deformed by a range of later structures, \nincluding kink bands (dextral sense of off-set), normal microfaults and small-scale \nshears. Near to the base of Unit II (S98555; see fig. 3 Phillips and Auton, 2000), \nbedding (S0) and S1 are off-set by two, steeply inclined clay-lined normal faults. \nFaulting also resulted in localised drag folding and brecciation of sediments in the \nimmediate footwall and hanging-wall, with the tip of one of the faults terminating in a \njigsaw-like breccia. The clay-lining to the faults possesses a well-developed plasmic \nfabric orientated parallel to the wall of the fault. This clay-lining is brecciated, \nindicating that at least one further phase of movement occurred along the faults.  \n \nHigher within Unit II (S98557; see Fig. 2), deformation resulted in reverse faulting. \nThis was preceded by a phase of soft-sediment deformation accompanied by localised \nliquefaction and water-escape (Fig. 3). Sand-filled hydrofractures, which deform the \nlaminated clay and silt in the lower part of the thin section, contain angular fragments \nof clay preserving earlier developed S1 fabric, kinks and shears. Soft-sediment \ndeformation led to the formation of a convolute lamination and complex disharmonic \nfolds within a bed of laminated silt and sand in the middle of the thin section (Fig. 3). \nWeakly laminated sand, in the upper part of the thin section, is deformed by a \ncomplex reverse fault, comprising an anastomosing network of discrete shear planes \n(north to northwest-directed sense of movement), enclosing lenticular fragments of \nlaminated clay and silt (Fig. 3). There is no evidence of injection of fluidised sand \nalong the fault, which clearly truncates the earlier developed soft-sediment \ndeformation structures. Consequently, faulting post-dated liquefaction and its \nassociated soft-sediment deformation (cf. Phillips and Auton, 2000).  \n \n 6\nSample S98556 includes the boundary between the most intensely deformed part of \nUnit II and overlying diamicton of Unit III (see Fig. 2). The laminated silts and clays \nare deformed by a range of both ductile and brittle structures, including upright to \nrecumbent folds, thrusts, normal and reverse microfaults (see fig. 6 of Phillips and \nAuton, 2000). Both the orientation of the thrusts and asymmetry of the folds record a \nnorthwest-directed sense of movement, with thrusting resulting in imbrication of the \nlaminated silts and clays. The intensity of faulting increases towards the contact with \nthe overlying diamicton. This contact is irregular, with \u2018flame-like\u2019 apophyses of \nplastically deformed silt and clay extending upwards into the diamicton. It is also off-\nset by reverse faults, with the sandy matrix of the diamicton injected downward along \nthese structures. Planar, lattice-like (lattisepic) and circular (skelsepic) fabrics are \nheterogeneously developed within the diamicton, reflecting the variation in clay \ncontent of the matrix.  \n \n3.3. Interpretation \nThe microstructures present in the Raitts Burn sediments show that the style of \ndeformation changes upwards through the sequence associated with an increase in its \nintensity and complexity. The relationships between the various microstructures were \ninterpreted by Phillips and Auton (2000) in terms of a polyphase deformation history \n(Fig. 4). At all stratigraphic levels within glaciolacustrine sediments, the earliest phase \nof deformation (D1) led to the development of the bedding-parallel S1 fabric within \nthe clay laminae. Phillips and Auton (2000) suggested that this pervasive fabric \ndeveloped in response to initial compaction\/loading by overriding ice. This early \nfabric was subsequently deformed by kink bands and ductile shears, assigned to D2 \n(Fig. 4). The effects of D2 are not recognised in the upper part of the sequence, \nprobably due to the complete destruction of the early structures by intense subsequent \ndeformation at this level.  \n \nAt the base of the sequence, the D1 and D2 structures are off-set by clay-lined normal \n(extensional) faults which are, therefore, D3 in age (Fig. 4). The presence of clay-\nlinings show that faults were open, allowing water to flow along them. The jigsaw-\nlike brecciation at the tip of one of the faults is thought to have formed in response to \nthe flow of overpressured subglacial groundwater through the sediments (cf. Boulton \nand Caban, 1995); probably recording a marked increase in pore-water pressure \n 7\nduring D3. Further evidence for an increase in pore-water pressure during D3 is \nprovided by hydrofracturing of the more cohesive clays and accompanying \nliquefaction and soft-sediment deformation of sand and silt interbeds. The marked \ncontrast in style of deformation shown by the clay-silt and sand laminae is directly \nrelated to sediment composition and the pore water pressure. The reverse faulting \n(designated as D4), in the middle part of the sequence, post-dates soft-sediment \ndeformation and liquefaction (Fig. 4). It indicates an increase in the effective stress of \nthe sediments after D3, due to a decrease in pore-water pressure in response to \ndewatering.  \n \nThe most intense deformation occurs at the top of the glaciolacustrine sequence \nimmediately below the diamicton. The resultant folding and thrusting, as well as \nnormal and reverse faulting are assigned to D4 (Fig. 4) (cf. Phillips and Auton, 2000). \nAll of these structures record a consistent north to northwest-directed sense of shear \nduring D4. Initial ductile folding was followed by more brittle thrusting. The \ngeometry of the array of normal and reverse faults associated with the thrusts is \nconsistent with them having formed as Riedel shears (Passchier and Trouw, 1996). \nThe thrusts and reverse faults propagated upwards through the glaciolacustrine \nsediments to deform the base of the newly deposited diamicton. \n \nPhillips and Auton (2000) concluded that the D1 to D4 structures developed during a \nsingle progressive deformation event and that its intensity increased with time. D1 to \nD3 were attributed a subglacial origin, resulting from wet-based ice over-riding fine-\ngrained sediments, deposited in a proglacial lake. D4 records shearing which resulted \nfrom northerly directed ice-push during deposition of overlying morainic sediments. \n \n3.4. Coire Mhic-sith, Drumochter   \nCoire Mhic-sith [NN 655 745] is a deeply incised, fault-guided valley located \nnortheast of Dalnaspidal Lodge, near the Drumochter Pass col (Fig. 1) on the margin \nof the Gaick Plateau. As at Raitts Burn, the Coire Mhic-sith site preserves a sequence \nof fine-grained glaciolacustrine sediments which have been overridden by ice during a \nminor readvance. Sissons (1974, 1980) and Sissons et al., (1973) concluded that ice \noccupied the whole of Coire Mhic-sith during the Loch Lomond Stadial, flowing \ntowards the southwest from an ice cap located on the Gaick Plateau to the northeast. \n 8\nHowever, no unequivocal evidence has been found in support of Loch Lomond \nStadial ice flowing into the valley from the Gaick Plateau. Furthermore, the presence \nof glaciolacustrine deposits at the bottom of Coire Mhic-sith and a glacial spillway \nlinking with a tributary valley of Edendon Water to the southeast, suggest that the \nCoire Mhic-sith valley was occupied by a lake ponded by ice to the southwest (see \nfig. 53 of Lucas and Merritt, 2004). The sense of movement indicated by the \ndeformation structures preserved in the lacustrine sediments in Coire Mhic-sith \nclearly indicate that they were deformed during a minor readvance, when westerly \nsourced ice re-occupied the lower reaches of the valley (Lukas and Merritt, 2004), \nthough the age of the readvance has yet to be established (see Benn and Ballantyne, \n2005).  \n \nThe Coire Mhic-sith sequence is shown in Fig. 5. A unit of silt and fine-grained \nmicaceous sand (Unit I, Fig. 5), containing evidence of loading and sand ball \ndevelopment, occurs at the base of the sequence. It is overlain by a fining upward \nsequence of rhythmically laminated, glaciolacustrine clays, silts and very fine-grained \nsands (Unit II, Fig. 5). The top of Unit II is composed of extremely compact silt and \nclay, which is intensely deformed. The intensity of this deformation increases \nupwards towards the base of the overlying diamicton (Unit III, Fig. 5), in a manner \nsimilar to that seen at Raitts Burn. In the lower part of this deformed zone, the \nsedimentary lamination is folded and thrusted. The gently to moderately inclined \nasymmetrical folds and thrusts both record a consistent easterly directed sense of \ndisplacement. Although ductile folding is present, brittle faulting predominates. \nImmediately below the diamicton, the clay laminae are boudinaged into small rafts, \nthat are included within a homogenous matrix of silt and sand. This, as at Raitts Burn, \nis again indicative of liquefaction and water escape. At Coire Mhic-sith, however, the \ndeformed glaciolacustrine deposits are immediately overlain by a much harder, \ncompact diamicton (Unit III, Fig 5), which is in turn overlain by a clast-supported \ncobble gravel (Unit IV, Fig. 5). \n \n3.5. Micromorphology \nAnalysis of the deformed sediments at Coire Mhic-sith has confirmed that there is a \nsystematic change in the style and intensity of deformation upward through the \nsequence. In thin section (N4127; N4128; N4129), these finely laminated \n 9\nglaciolacustrine sediments are seen to be composed of fine-grained sand, silt and clay \n(Fig. 6). As at Raitts Burn, the earliest deformation structure present throughout the \nsequence is a bedding-parallel (S1) plasmic fabric which is modified by all the other \ndeformation structures. Although these later structures include ductile folds, \ndeformation was predominantly brittle in nature and dominated by faulting. In the \nleast deformed part of Unit II (N4127; see Fig. 5), bedding and S1 are off-set by a \nconjugate set of low-angle to moderately dipping reverse faults (Fig. 6a). The faults \nare marked by a narrow band of clay possessing a moderate to well-developed planar \n(unistrial) plasmic fabric (S2 in age). Open asymmetrical, monoclinal folds are locally \ndeveloped within the hanging walls of these faults (Fig. 6a). In general, the folds and \nconjugate faults indicate an overall easterly directed sense of shear, suggesting that \nthey developed during the same deformation event. \n \nSample N4128 is from slightly higher within Unit II (see Fig. 5). In thin section the \nlaminated silts and clays are deformed by a prominent zone of thrusting, as well as by \na number of westerly dipping reverse faults (Fig. 6b). These faults all record an \neasterly directed sense of movement, consistent with glacier ice advancing from the \nwest. The clay-rich sediments at the bottom of the thin section are repeated by an \nanastomosing network of subhorizontal thrusts, defining a c. 2 cm wide zone of \nimbrication (Fig. 6b). Graded bedding preserved within the individual thrust slices \nindicates that the sediments were translated eastwards, but not overturned, during \nthrusting. Along the thrust planes, S1 is deformed to form an asymmetrical S-C fabric \ngeometry (see Passchier and Trouw, 1996) which records a sinistral sense of shear, \nagain consistent with an easterly directed sense of ice-movement. In the upper part of \nsample N4128, bedding is deformed by prominent reverse faults (Fig. 6b), with \nassociated micro-faulting in their hanging walls. A layer of clean sand at the top of the \nsample has been partially homogenised, and contains angular, broken fragments of \nlaminated silt and clay (Fig. 6b). A narrow fault zone can be traced into the \nhomogenised sand. Sand has also been injected downwards along the fault, leading to \nbrecciation within the immediate footwall (Fig. 6b). These microtextural relationships \nare consistent with the liquefaction and remobilisation of the sand having post-dated \nfaulting. \n \n 10\nSample N4129 (Fig. 7) was taken from the most intensely deformed part of the \nsequence, immediately below the diamicton (see Fig. 5). The upper part of the sample \nis highly deformed and composed of variably sheared and boudinaged fragments of \nlaminated silt and clay within a relatively homogenous matrix of silt and very fine-\ngrained sand (Fig. 7). Locally the clay laminae are cut into a number of elongate, \nasymmetrical boudins. A moderately well-developed S1 plasmic fabric preserved \nwithin these clay boudins is deformed into an asymmetrical S-C-like fabric. Both the \nshape of the boudins and S-C-like plasmic fabric record a sinistral, easterly directed \nsense of shear. A similar sense of shear is also obtained from the asymmetry of the \nlamination preserved in the least deformed parts of the thin section (Fig. 7).  \n \nThe highly sheared sediments at the top of sample N4129 are dissected by a number \nof gently easterly dipping extensional normal faults. These are lined by thin seams of \nsilt and very fine-grained sand. The easterly directed sense of movement on the faults \nis comparable to similar structures developed within samples N4127 and N4128. This \nsuggests that faulting at all levels within Unit II occurred during the same deformation \nevent.  \n \nThe lower part of the N4129 is composed of fragmented laminated sand, silt and silty \nclay, cut by a network of sand-filled veins or hydrofractures (Fig. 7). The fluidised \nclean sand which fills these veins is homogenous and contains small, randomly \norientated fragments (rafts) of silt and clay. In general, however, the bedding can be \ntraced between the individual fragments (see Fig. 7), indicating that there has been \nvery little rotation and\/or transport of these rafts. The laminated sediments which \nmake up these fragments are themselves deformed by a number of normal and reverse \nmicrofaults. The fluidised sand has been injected along the larger of these faults, \nagain indicating liquefaction and remobilisation of the sand post-dated initial faulting. \nThe style of deformation and relative timing of liquefaction present in sample N4129 \nis comparable to that seen at the top of N4128.  \n \n3.6. Interpretation \nThe relationships between the various microstructures present within the deformed \nglaciolacustrine sediments exposed at Coire Mhic-sith can be shown to record a \npolyphase history of deformation (Fig. 8). Although the features include ductile folds, \n 11\ndeformation within these sediments is predominantly brittle in nature. At all levels, \nthe earliest phase of deformation (D1) led to the development of the bedding-parallel \nS1 fabric within the clay laminae. As in the Raitts Burn sequence, it is likely that this \nfabric developed in response to initial compaction and dewatering of the sediments or \nloading induced by an overriding glacier. Bedding and S1 are then deformed by both \nnormal and reverse faults, which are, therefore, D2 in age (Fig. 8).  \n \nThe sense of displacement recorded by the D2 thrusts, and by the normal and reverse \nfaults (N4127; N4128) are all consistent with an easterly directed sense of ice-push. A \nsimilar sense of shear is recorded by folds developed within the hanging walls of the \nlow-angle reverse faults, which is consistent with all of the folding and faulting \nhaving occurred during the same D2 deformation event. Sedimentary structures (e.g. \ngraded bedding) clearly demonstrate that the sequence is the right way-up, indicating \nthat D2 thrusting and folding did not result in the overturning and\/or significant \ntectonic thickening of the sequence.  \n \nAs at Raitts Burn, there is an observed increase in the intensity of deformation \nupwards through the Coire Mhic-sith sequence, with most intense deformation \n(represented by the top of sample N4129) occurring immediately below the overlying \ndiamicton. Kinematic indicators (S-C-fabrics, asymmetry of the clay-silt boudins, \nsense of displacement on low-angle normal faults) present within these highly \ndeformed silts and clays again record an easterly directed sense of shear; consistent \nwith D2 in the underlying less deformed sediments (Fig. 8). Immediately below the \nhighly deformed silts and clays (represented by the top of sample N4128 and bottom \nof sample N4129), the laminated sediments are cut by a network of diffuse, sand-\nfilled veins and hydrofractures (Figs. 6b and 7). Liquefied sand also occurs along the \nearlier formed D2 faults, with the injection of this clean sand locally resulting in the \nbrecciation of the laminated sediments in the immediate footwall of these structures. \nThese relationships suggest that both compressional and extensional faulting had \nceased, and that liquefaction and remobilisation of the sand post-dated D2 (see Fig. \n8). The faults appear to have acted as fluid pathways aiding water-escape. Although \nliquefaction and water-escape occurred after brittle deformation, the rise in pore-water \npressure leading to liquefaction occurred later, in response to a marked increase in \noverburden pressure induced by the overriding ice. \n 12\n 4. Proglacially deformed glaciolacustrine and distal deltaic sediments \n \n4.1. Glen Luibeg, Cairngorm Mountains \nThe deeply incised valley of Glen Luibeg [NH 017 937] is located on the southern \nmargin of the Cairngorm Mountains (Fig. 1). During the Devensian glaciation these \nmountains formed an area of selective linear erosion (Sugden, 1968; Rea, 1998; Hall \nand Glasser, 2003), where a plateau ice field fed radial outlet glaciers that exploited \nzones of structural weakness in the underlying metasedimentary and granitic bedrock. \nDuring the last Glacial Maximum (c. 22 ka B.P.), these outlet glaciers were confluent \nwith ice flowing eastward from a major accumulation area in the Western Highlands \n(Barrow et al., 1913; Brazier et al., 1996, 1998). During the latter stages of \ndownwasting and retreat of the Main Late Devensian ice sheet, Glen Luibeg was \noccupied by a lake, impounded by ice occupying the lower reaches of the glen \n(Golledge, 2003). Meltwater carrying sediment from the glacier that dammed the lake, \nfed an ice-contact delta that prograded northwards.  \n \nSediment accumulated in the ice-dammed lake to produce a thick sequence of \nlaminated sands and silts with rare clays, interbedded with subaqueous debris-flow \ndiamictons (see fig. 2 of Golledge, 2003). The lower part of the sequence at the Glen \nLuibeg [NH 017 937] site comprises a thick (> 5 m) massive matrix-supported \ndiamicton, which is immediately overlain by much thinner (0.5 m) diamicton, \ncontaining thin beds and lenses of coarse sand (Units I and II, Fig. 9). Golledge \n(2003) interpreted both of these over-consolidated diamictons as being subglacial in \norigin, having been deposited by northerly retreating ice. This glacier occupied the \nglen prior to the formation of the lake, which was dammed by ice that impinged into \nthe valley from the south. The diamictons are overlain by a thick unit of laminated \nsilts and fine sands, with minor clay laminae (Unit III, Fig. 9). These fine-grained \nsediments are thought to record deposition within both the distal parts of the delta and \non the lake bed. The upper 1 m of Unit III is highly deformed and disrupted. Open \nfolds and faults are common, and the sedimentary lamination is locally streaked out \nand boudinaged. The glaciolacustrine and deltaic sediments are overlain by a thin \ngravelly diamicton (Unit IV, Fig. 9) which grades upwards into a unit of poorly \nbedded sand and silt (Unit V Fig. 9). The diamicton is interpreted as a debris flow \n 13\nwith the overlying sands partially reworking the top of this deposit (Golledge, 2003). \nThe clast-rich, sandy diamicton at the top of the sequence (Unit VI, Fig. 9) is thought \nto have been deposited as a subaqueous debris flow. \n \n4.2. Micromorphology \nTwo orientated samples (N5080; N5081) were taken from the deformed upper part of \nUnit II (see Fig. 9). Sample N5080 was orientated parallel to the main direction of ice \nmovement determined for Glen Luibeg area by Golledge (2003), with sample N5081 \napproximately orthogonal to it. This allowed the microstructures to be examined in \n3D.  \n \nIn thin section, the glaciolacustrine sediments are composed of finely laminated sand, \nsilt and clay (Fig. 10). The sand and silt laminae are normally graded, indicating that \nalthough deformed, the sediments are the right way up. A bedding-parallel fabric, \ndefined by the preferred shape alignment of detrital micas, is developed within the \nsands. In the adjacent clay laminae, a weakly developed S1 plasmic fabric occurs \nparallel to the sedimentary lamination. In both samples (N5080; N5081), the \nlamination and S1 foliation are deformed by several sets of microfaults, indicating \nthat the imposition of the bedding-parallel fabric pre-dated faulting and is D1 in age.  \n \nAlthough open folding was observed at outcrop, in thin section small-scale folding is \nlimited to very localised drag folds, with deformation being dominated by brittle \nfaults (Fig. 10). Microstructures associated with proglacial deformation are best \ndeveloped within sample N5080, where four sets of faults have been recognised (Fig. \n10a): (1) sub-horizontal to gently south-dipping thrusts; (2) gently to moderately \nsouth-dipping reverse faults; (3) a set of gently to moderately north-dipping normal \nfaults; and (4) a small number of steeply dipping normal and reverse faults and \nassociated shear bands. The sense of displacement on the thrusts and gently to \nmoderately dipping normal and reverse faults, are consistent with an overall sense of \ndisplacement towards the north. In general, the faults belonging to sets 2 and 3 \nterminate at, or link into the thrust faults (set 1) (Fig. 10a). However, in the upper part \nof sample N5080, a prominent normal fault (set 3) cuts through and off-sets the tip of \na thrust (Fig. 10a). The tip of this thrust is marked by asymmetrical, disharmonic \nmicrofolds which are dissected by a number of small-scale reverse faults.  \n 14\n Individual fault planes (normal and reverse) are diffuse in nature and marked by a \nnarrow band of realigned detrital micas or thin seam of very fine-grained silty sand. \nOn a number of the normal faults (set 3) the silty sand and silt linings are graded, \nindicating that these extensional structures were open, allowing water flow along the \nfault plane. Thrusts are preferentially developed within the clay-rich part of the \nsequence and are defined by a poorly to moderately developed planar (unistrial) \nplasmic fabric. In the central part of sample N5080, a number of closely spaced \nthrusts have resulted in the imbrication of the clay-rich laminated sediments (Fig. \n10a). Bedding within the individual thrust slices has been tilted and is weakly arcuate \nin form. This asymmetry of the lamination yields a sinistral sense of shear, consistent \nwith northerly directed thrusting.  \n \nAlthough a similar range of structures are developed in both N5080 and N5081 there \nis a clear difference in the apparent intensity of deformation recorded by each sample \n(compare Figs. 10a and 10b). The most intense deformation is recorded in sample \nN5080 which was aligned parallel to the main direction of inferred ice movement. \nSample N5081 is orientated at right angles to N5080, parallel to the strike of the main \nfault sets identified in the latter (see Fig 11a). Consequently, in sample N5081 the \nmajority of the faults occur parallel, or at a low-angle to bedding. Their lower angle of \napparent dip and apparent amount of displacement is seen to be due to the plane of \norientation of the section. The main planes of displacement in sample N5081 can be \ncorrelated with the thrusts (set 1) and normal faults (set 3) present in sample N5080 \n(Fig. 11a). As in sample N5080, the thrusts in N5081 result in the imbrication of the \nclay-rich horizons, as well as minor folding (Fig. 10b). Both the thrusts and normal \nfaults record an easterly directed sense of movement and are cross-cut by irregular \nsand-filled veins (Fig. 10b); the latter clearly post-date faulting. A small number of \nmoderate to steeply, easterly dipping normal and reverse faults were also observed in \nthe latter sample.  \n \n4.3. Interpretation \nThe microstructures within the laminated sediments exposed in Glen Luibeg indicate \nthat proglacial deformation was dominated by brittle faulting. All of the fault sets \ndisplace bedding and the variably developed bedding-parallel fabric (S1). This clearly \n 15\nindicates that the imposition of S1 pre-dated faulting, and that the faults are \nconsequently D2 in age (Fig. 12). In the sandy laminae, this S1 fabric is defined by \nshape-aligned detrital micas and is probably primarily of sedimentary origin. It is \nlikely that the bedding-parallel S1 plasmic fabric present within the adjacent clay \nlaminae may also have pre-dated proglacial deformation, and developed during \ndeposition and\/or in response to loading during compaction and initial dewatering of \nthe sedimentary pile. \n \nThe correlation that can be made between the faults present within samples N5080 \nand N5081, allows the construction of a 3D model (Fig. 11a) of the structures present. \nThe main structural elements are the subhorizontal thrusts, moderately south-dipping \nreverse faults and north-dipping normal faults. The geometry of these structures is \nconsistent with them having developed together as Riedel shears (Fig. 11b) during the \nsame D2 deformation event. The cross-cutting relationship shown between a normal \nfault (R shear, Fig. 11b) and one of the thrusts (Y shear, Fig. 11b) suggests that \ndeformation was progressive in nature. The micromorphological evidence also \nindicates that thrusting was preferentially partitioned into the more clay-rich parts of \nthe sequence. Detachments developed along these relatively weaker clay-rich \nhorizons would have accommodated the initial shortening of the sedimentary pile \nduring initial ice-push. As deformation continued, the earlier formed thrusts (T1, Fig. \n11a) may have been abandoned, as continued compression was accommodated by \ndisplacement along a number of larger, more active thrust planes (T2, Fig. 11a). \nThese more prominent thrust systems developed within the thicker, more laterally \nextensive clay-rich horizons. Further shortening and compression of the sedimentary \npile, at a later stage of D2, was accommodated by shortening in the hanging walls of \nthe main thrust systems leading to normal and reverse faulting. These later faults \nlocally deform earlier developed structures resulting in the observed cross-cutting \nrelationships displayed between the various sets of faults (see Fig. 10). \n \nThe sense of displacement on the various sets of faults present in the thin sections \nfrom Glen Luibeg are consistent with an overall northerly directed sense of shear \nduring deformation. The minor easterly directed off-set recorded by the faults in \nsample N5081, indicates that the ice-push leading to proglacial deformation was \nslightly east of north; probably towards the north-northeast. This direction is \n 16\nconsistent with the minor re-advance of ice into Glen Luibeg from the south, \npostulated by Golledge (2003).  \n \n5. Glacially overridden sands and subglacial diamicton  \n \n5.1. Plumpe Farm, near Gretna  \nThe exposure at Plumpe Farm [NY 3344 6813] is situated to the east of the Scottish \nBorder at Gretna (BGS, 2006). The site is located within gently undulating low-lying \ndrumlinised ground close to where Trotter (1922) first recognised evidence of a \nsignificant southward readvance of Scottish ice into the Solway Lowlands during the \nLate Devensian glaciation. Further evidence for this readvance was found in the \nCarlisle area, to the south, where the so-called \u2018tripartite sequence\u2019 was established \nand subsequently correlated across northwest England (Trotter and Hollingworth, \n1932). Evidence for this readvance was subsequently questioned by Pennington \n(1970), Evans and Arthurton (1973) and Thomas (1985). However, recent work \n(Merritt and Auton, 2000; Huddart, 2002 and references therein) supports the \nexistence of a \u2018Scottish Readvance\u2019 and speculative correlations have been made with \nHeinrich Event 1 of the northern hemisphere (McCabe et al., 1998). All of these \nrecent studies suggest that, during the \u2018Scottish Readvance\u2019, glaciofluvial and \nglaciolacustrine sediments laid down in the Solway Lowlands during the initial retreat \nof the last Late Devensian ice sheet were over-ridden by ice from the Southern \nUplands. \n \nGenerally east\u2013west orientated drumlins in the Gretna area record an overall eastward \nice-flow direction across this till-covered part of the Solway lowlands. The exposure \nat Plumpe Farm is orientated at right-angles to this ice-flow direction. The exposed \nsequence is shown in Fig. 13 and probably constitutes only the upper most part of a \nlocally thick, extensive Quaternary succession developed on permeable Permo-\nTriassic sandstone. A thick deposit of laminated glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine sand, \nsilt and gravel (Plumpe Sand and Gravel Formation) (Units I and II, Fig. 13) is \noverlain by diamicton, the Plumpe Bridge Till  (Unit III, Fig. 13) (BGS, 2006). The \nmedium- to fine-grained sands and silts are graded and locally possess a ripple cross-\nlamination. In the surrounding area these sediments are underlain by a stiff, reddish \nbrown clayey till referred to as the Chapelknowe Till Formation. The upper part of \n 17\nUnit II is very hard and compact (Fig. 13) and appears to grade into the base of the \noverlying diamicton. The silts and sands of Unit II are over-consolidated, consistent \nwith them having been overridden by ice. However, no obvious macroscopic \ndeformation structures (folds, faults) were observed at outcrop in Unit II or in the less \nconsolidated sands and silts of Unit I. \n \n5.2. Micromorphology \nFour samples (N2840; N2841; N2842; N2843) were collected across the boundary \nbetween the laminated silts and sands (Units I and II), and overlying diamicton (Unit \nIII) (see Fig. 13). The samples were orientated parallel to the easterly regional ice-\nflow direction.  \n  \nIn thin section (N2840; N2841) the sediments from the Plumpe Sand and Gravel \nFormation are composed of laminated fine-grained sand, silt and clay (Fig. 14a). \nSome of the thicker sand laminae are normally graded and preserve a low-angle cross \nlamination. These sediments are essentially undeformed. Deformation, where present, \nis restricted to minor soft-sediment deformation (flame structures, disharmonic folds, \nwater-escape conduits) and associated liquefaction (Fig. 14a). Localised faulting and \nrare recumbent folding have also been observed. \nThe samples (N2842; N2843) from the base of the Plumpe Bridge Till (Fig. 13) are \ncomposed of a stratified, poorly sorted, sandy diamicton containing layers of highly \ndisrupted laminated silt and clay (Fig. 14b). The clay-rich layers within the till are \nlithologically similar to those within the underlying laminated sediments. The \nstratification within the diamicton becomes less pronounced and more diffuse \nupwards away from its base.  \nSample N2842 was taken to intersect the gradational boundary between the till and \nthe underlying glaciofluvial\/glaciolacustrine sediments. In detail, this boundary zone \nwas found to comprise alternating layers of laminated silt and clay and sandy \ndiamicton (Fig. 14b). Internally the silt and clay layers are variably deformed and \ndisrupted. In the least deformed layers, the lamination is contorted by small-scale \ndisharmonic folds, recumbent rootless folds and flame structures. These soft-sediment \ndeformation structures are cross-cut by thin veinlets and lenticles of clay cutan. The \n 18\nsilt laminae are variably homogenised, with liquefaction leading to the overprinting of \nearlier developed structures. In the more highly deformed layer, broken angular \nfragments of laminated clay occur within a homogenised silty or silty clay matrix. \nThese disrupted layers also contain rounded to elongate till pebbles (Type 1 till \npebbles, van der Meer 1993) (Figs. 14c to e). The till pebbles are similar in \ncomposition to the adjacent layers of diamicton and may be attached to them by a thin \ntail. \n \nThe edges of the diamicton layers are highly irregular in form (Fig. 14b). Locally they \nare contorted into open, cuspate folds and narrow, elongate flames. These flames are \nfilled by variably homogenised silt and\/or clay cutan. Individual bands of diamicton, \nas well as the margins of thicker layers, may be composed of rounded to elongate till \npebbles within a matrix of clay cutan (Figs. 14b to e). This clay matrix possesses a \nwell-developed plasmic fabric (Fig. 14d) which wraps around the till pebbles. \nHowever, apart from locally being embayed against neighbouring more rigid rock \nfragments, the till pebbles are essentially undeformed. The resultant pebble-rich \ndiamicton has a matrix- to clast-supported, \u2018globular\u2019 texture (Figs. 14b and e). \n \n5.3. Interpretation \nThin sections of the fine sands, silts and clays from the Plumpe Sand and Gravel \nFormation confirm field observations that these sediments are largely undeformed. \nDeformation, where present, is restricted to possible compaction, minor folding and \nsoft-sediment contortions due to loading. Although the Plumpe Sand and Gravel \nFormation has been over-ridden by ice, the absence of significant glacitectonic \ndeformation suggests that conditions at the ice-sediment interface were such as to \nimpede the transmission of shear into these finely laminated sediments.  \n \nThe boundary between the Plumpe Sand and Gravel Formation and overlying Plumpe \nBridge Till is gradational over a few 10\u2019s of centimetres. Microstructures present \nwithin the stratified base of the till, such as disharmonic folds and flame structures, \ncoupled with the liquefaction and homogenisation of the silty laminae are consistent \nwith the sediment having had a high water content during the deposition and \ndeformation of this diamicton.  \n \n 19\nThe lack of pervasive deformation in the glacially overridden laminated sands and \nsilts at Plumpe Farm may, at least in part, be a result of the regional palaeogeography \nat the time of the Scottish Readvance. During the Readvance, glacier ice from the \nSouthern Uplands flowed over the flat-lying glaciofluvial\/glaciolacustrine sediments, \nencountering a number of ice-marginal lakes ponded against high ground to the east \n(Trotter, 1929; Hollingworth, 1932). The water-saturated nature of these sediments \naided movement of the ice, which locally would have occurred on a water lubricated \nsurface. This lubricated surface dramatically reduced the amount of shear translated \ninto the underlying sediments of the Plumpe Sand and Gravel Formation. Any \ndisplacement would have been focused into this water-rich zone leading to the \nobserved disharmonic folding and soft-sediment deformation being confined within \nthe stratified base of the Plumpe Bridge Till. \n \nThe layers rich in till pebbles within the diamicton are thought to have developed \nduring the deposition of the Plumpe Bridge Till. Van der Meer (1993) concluded that \ntill pebbles develop in response to rotational movement (simple shear) during \nsubglacial deformation (also see van der Meer, 1994; Hiemstra and van der Meer, \n1997). The model proposed by van der Meer (1993) requires initial fracturing of the \ntill followed by rotation and rounding of the pebbles (see fig. 6 of Hiemstra and van \nder Meer, 1997). The microtextures developed within the Plumpe Bridge Till indicate \nthat, in this case, the diamicton was apparently water saturated at the time of till \npebble formation. The layers rich in till pebbles within the stratified base of this \ndiamicton possess a matrix-supported texture; the matrix being composed of a clay \ncutan (Figs. 14b to e). Initial \u2018fragmentation\u2019 of the diamicton may have occurred in \nresponse to turbulent flow within the water-saturated sediment (cf. Phillips, 2006; \nEvans et al., 2006). This would have also aided in the mixing and incorporation of the \nunderlying laminated fine-grained sediments into the base of the diamicton. Liquefied \nsilt and clay derived from these fine-grained sediments would have been remobilised \nand injected into diamicton. During this process, clay would have been deposited \nwithin the interstices between the till pebbles, coating these grains with a layer of \ncutan. The distinctive \u2018globular\u2019 appearance of the till pebble layers is thought to have \ndeveloped in response to the mixing of these water-saturated sediments with the \ndiamicton during the deposition of the Plumpe Bridge Till; an interpretation supported \nby the gradational nature of its base. \n 20\n 6. Subglacial and proglacial deformed deltaic gravels, sands and silts, and \nassociated diamictons  \n  \n6.1. Drumbeg Quarry, near Drymen \nDrumbeg Quarry [NN 479 877] lies to the southeast of the village of Drymen east of \nLoch Lomond in central Scotland (Fig. 1), within the limit of the Loch Lomond \nReadvance marked by its terminal moraine (Rose, 1981). The quarry cuts through one \nof a series of ridges formed by coalesced ice-contact subaqueous fans\/deltas that \nprograded into Lake Blane during the recession of the eastern margin of the Loch \nLomond glacier lobe from its readvance limit (see fig. 1 of Phillips et al., 2002). The \nsequence of deltaic sands and gravels (Fig. 15), and proximal subaqueous outwash \ngravels (Benn and Evans, 1996) were locally deformed during the active retreat of the \nLoch Lomond glacier.  \n \nPhillips et al. (2002) provided macroscopic evidence that these sediments had \nundergone a polyphase deformation history interspersed with periods of erosion and \ndeposition. The earliest deformation event (D1) was driven by the northeasterly \nreadvance of the Loch Lomond lobe into the ice-contact slope of the fan\/delta. This \nproglacial D1 deformation event, is restricted to the lower part of the sequence now \nexposed at Drumbeg Quarry (Unit I, Fig. 15). It resulted in tilting of bedding and \ntectonic thickening of the sequence by folding (F1) and thrusting. In the mid- to outer-\nparts of the fan\/delta, however, sedimentation apparently continued uninterrupted \nduring D1 deformation. As the ice retreated, the fan-delta was re-established, leading \nto a period of erosion of the lower parts of the succession, followed by deposition of a \nsequence of proximal sands and gravels (Unit II, Fig. 15) upon these underlying \npolydeformed sediments.  \n \nA second phase of readvance of the Loch Lomond ice-lobe resulted in ductile \nshearing and disruption of this proximal sedimentary sequence (Phillips et al., 2002). \nThis northeast-directed, subglacial deformation event (D2) accompanied the \ndeposition of a carapace of diamicton (2-3 m thick) (Unit III, Fig. 15) and affected a \ngreater part of the fan-delta complex than D1. Folding and boudinage during D2 lead \nto the disruption of the originally well-bedded sediments and eventual disaggregation \n 21\nand homogenisation of the sand and gravel beds. Deformation within the sand, silty \nsand and clay-rich lenses is highly heterogeneous. In the most intensely deformed \nunits, the sedimentary lamination is transposed by a well-developed, finely banded \nfabric. This apparently intense deformation is in marked contrast to that recorded by \nthe adjacent sand lenses, in which primary sedimentary structures (lamination, \ngrading, cross-bedding) are often preserved. Elsewhere, D2 resulted in soft-sediment \ndeformation, accompanied by liquefaction and water escape. An anastomosing \nnetwork of ductile shear zones formed during D2, locally tectonically excised parts of \nthe underlying sequence. One of these shear zone forms the contact between this D2 \ndeformed sequence and the overlying diamicton (Fig. 15). Phillips et al. (2002) \ninterpreted a southwest-dipping banding within this \u2018high strain zone\u2019 as a \nglacitectonic fabric. However, no obvious macroscopic kinematic indicators were \nrecognised within it.  \n \nThe subsequent retreat of the Loch Lomond ice-lobe, from the overridden part of the \nice-contact delta, was accompanied by erosion and truncation of all the earlier \ndeveloped deformation structures and partial removal of the diamicton. The \nunderlying deformed sequence was unconformably overlain by sands and gravels \n(Unit IV, Fig. 15) as the fan-delta complex was re-established. Deposition of the \nlocally channellised deltaic sequence was apparently terminated by the deposition of a \nthin diamicton which caps the sequence exposed in Drumbeg Quarry.  \n \n6.2. Micromorphology: proglacially deformed sediments \nTwo orientated samples (N3772; N3773) were collected from the limbs of the F1 \nfolds within the proglacially deformed part of the sequence (see Fig. 15). In thin \nsection the interlaminated silt, silty clay and sand are deformed by a well-developed \ndomainal crenulation cleavage to transposition fabric (Fig. 16). This fabric occurs \naxial planar to the macroscopic F1 folds and is, therefore, S1 in age. The \nmicrostructural relationships developed within the domainal S1 crenulation cleavage \nare comparable to those present within deformed metamorphic rocks (see Bell and \nRubenach, 1983; Vernon, 1989; Passchier and Trouw, 1996). The sedimentary \nlamination (S0) is preserved within the lower strain areas, or domains, of the S1 \nfabric, where it is deformed by tight to isoclinal crenulation-style microfolds (Fig. \n16). The sense of shear recorded by these crenulations is consistent with them having \n 22\ndeveloped in response to layer-parallel flexural-slip on the limb of the larger, \nmacroscopic F1 fold.  \n \nIn the clay-rich laminae, a fine-scale foliation is defined by narrow clay-rich shears \nwhich possess a weakly to moderately developed planar (unistrial) plasmic fabric. \nThis plasmic fabric occurs axial planar to the crenulations and is, therefore, S1 in age. \nIn the more intensely deformed areas, the sedimentary lamination has been transposed \ninto a new tectonic banding or foliation composed of alternating clay- and silt-rich \nfoliae. This foliation is parallel to the crenulation cleavage (Fig. 16b) and is, therefore, \nalso S1 in age. The apparently lower strain domains within the S1 crenulation \ncleavage contain lenses or patches of massive to weakly laminated, clean sand (Fig. \n16). These sand lenses occur parallel to S1, but are locally observed cross-cutting this \nfoliation (Fig. 16). The lenses and patches of clean sand which cross-cut S1, \ncorrespond to the macroscopic sand-filled water-escape features described by Phillips \net al. (2002). These features occur axial planar to the F1 folds, with liquefied sand \napparently have been injected along the S1 crenulation cleavage. \n \nIn sample N3773 the S1 crenulation cleavage is off-set by a northeast-directed thrust \nand reverse faults (Fig. 16b). The faults are marked by a thin layer or seam of clayey \nsilt, suggesting that they may have controlled water-escape either during, or after D1.  \n \n6.3. Micromorphology: subglacial deformation \nSamples of the most highly disrupted sands and silts were collected from the \nsubglacially deformed part of the Drumbeg sequence (N3771; N3775) and the \noverlying diamicton (N3770; N3769) (see Fig. 15).  \n \nIn thin section (N3771; N3775) the subglacially deformed sands possesses a \ndistinctive, streaked-out, mottled appearance and are composed of irregular to \nelongate patches of silty sand and clay. The original sediment was composed of inter-\nlaminated fine-grained sand, silt and clay. The boundaries between the sandy and \nmore clay-rich areas are highly irregular, lobate to locally flame-like, consistent with \nthese sediments have been strongly modified and disrupted due to deformation and \naccompanying liquefaction. The patches of finely laminated silt and clay are \ndeformed by convolute to disharmonic folds. These clay-rich sediments locally grade \n 23\ninto irregular patches of clay cutan. The lamination within the silt-clay patches is \neither a primary sedimentary feature, or in some instances is of secondary in origin \nand formed during liquefaction and remobilisation of the sediment. \n \nThe sandy patches possess an open to moderately packed, \u2018cement\u2019- to grain-\nsupported texture. The \u2018cement\u2019 is composed of a clay cutan which possess a well-\ndeveloped plasmic fabric that wraps around the included sand grains. The overall \ntexture of these sands suggest that this \u2018cement\u2019 was formed when the sediment was \nin a highly dilated, fluidised state. Clay cutan also fills irregular veinlets and wispy to \nflame-like lenticles which cross-cut the sands. In sample N3775, these clay-filled \nfeatures form an anastomosing network of micro-scale flow zones which developed \nduring the dewatering of the sands.  \n \nThe till that caps the subglacially deformed sequence is composed of a poorly sorted, \nmatrix supported, sandy diamicton (N3770) containing pebbles of sandstone, basalt \nand metamorphic rocks (Fig.17). The diamicton is little deformed, with only a very \nweakly developed plasmic fabric. The very low clay content and sandy nature of the \ndiamicton matrix, however, would have restricted plasmic fabric development during \nsubglacial deposition and deformation. A lack of any obvious deformation structures \nwithin the diamicton at Drumbeg was also noted by Evans and Hiemstra (2005) who \nequated till deposition with a process of incremental thickening in an oscillating \nsubmarginal setting. \n \nSample N3770 (Fig. 17) is from the base of the diamicton and includes part of the \nshear zone developed at the contact with the underlying sands and gravels. In thin \nsection the macroscopic foliation developed within this shear zone, is defined by \nalternating bands or layers of laminated silt, silty clay and sand. Sedimentary \nstructures are, in general, absent within the silts and clays, which is consistent with \nthe banding\/lamination being glacitectonic in origin. This interpretation is supported \nby the presence of a variably developed layer-parallel plasmic fabric (S2) within the \nclay-rich bands. However, when examined at higher magnification a number of the \nsilty laminae are seen to be reverse-graded, suggesting that they are, at least in part, \nwater-lain. The fine-scale banding and layer-parallel plasmic fabric are deformed by \ndisharmonic folds, flame structures and diffuse shears, indicative of soft-sediment \n 24\ndeformation. Some of the silt laminae have also been homogenised, with liquefaction \npossibly contemporaneous with soft-sediment deformation. The disrupted clay-rich \nlayer immediately below the diamicton possesses a well-developed lattisepic plasmic \nfabric and is deformed by narrow shear bands. These shear bands define a variably \ndeveloped extensional crenulation cleavage (ECC) or SC-fabric. The sense of shear \nrecorded by this fabric is uncertain due to later disruption.  \n \nThe layering within the shear zone is cross-cut by a number of sand-filled \nhydrofractures (lower part of N3770, Fig. 17). At the base, these water-escape \nfeatures are connected to a layer of clean sand which contains angular to subangular \nfragments of silty clay that are lithologically similar to the adjacent banded fine-\ngrained sediments. The sand-filled hydrofractures also penetrate the base of the \noverlying diamicton. Immediately below the diamicton the sand-filled water-escape \nconduits spread laterally and are associated with a zone of fragmented\/brecciated silt \nand clay (Fig. 17). Elongate, broken \u2018rafts\u2019 of silt and clay also occur at the base of \nthe diamicton.  \n \n6.4. Interpretation \nThe micromorphological analysis confirms the field observations of Phillips et al. \n(2002) that there is a marked contrast in the style of proglacial D1 and subglacial D2 \ndeformation recorded by the glacigenic sediments at Drumbeg Quarry (see Fig. 18). \nThe predominantly sandy sediments deformed during D1 have undergone folding and \nthrusting (Fig. 18). F1 folding was accompanied by the imposition of an axial planar, \ndomainal S1 crenulation to transposition fabric within the finer grained units (Figs. 16 \nand 18). The morphology of this fabric is similar to crenulation cleavages developed \nwithin polydeformed metamorphic rocks (Bell and Rubenach, 1983; Vernon, 1989; \nPasschier and Trouw, 1996) with crenulation-style folding of bedding being preserved \nwithin lower strain domains. Sand-filled water-escape conduits occur parallel to, and \nlocally cross-cut S1. In detail, these sand-filled features developed along the lower \nstrain domains of the S1 cleavage (Fig. 16). This microtextural relationship indicates \nthat S1 locally controlled the sites of water-escape and that dewatering occurred \nduring D1.  \n \n 25\nIn contrast to the subglacial D1 event, microstructures developed during the later \nsubglacial D2 deformation of the overlying ice-proximal sands and gravels, are \nconsistent with the soft-sediment deformation. The composition of the sediments \naffected by D1 and D2 are similar, so any differences in the style of deformation are \nprobably related to water content and pore water pressure at the time of deformation. \nBoth D1 and D2 were caused by the advance of the Loch Lomond ice-lobe \nnortheastwards into Lake Blane. Consequently, it is likely during both readvance \nphases, the deltaic sediments were water saturated. Differences in water content and \npore pressure during D1 and D2 may, therefore, have been affected by the setting of \nthese deformation events. For instance, during proglacial D1 deformation the \nrelatively high porosity and permeability of these unconsolidated sands would have \ninitially allowed water to escape, keeping the effected pore-water pressure relatively \nlow. However, tectonic thickening of the sedimentary pile during subglacial \ndeformation (D1), would have resulted in the consolidation of the sediments. This \nmay have led to a reduction in permeability and an increase in pore-water pressure. \nThe result would have been the localised liquefaction and fluidisation of the sands \nduring the later stages of D1. The presence of thin silt and clay interbeds also formed \ntemporary barriers, locally impeding water-escape. The progressive development of \nthe domainal S1 cleavage within these clayey sediments, however, provided an ideal \nfluid pathway allowing trapped pore-water to escape.  \n \nDuring subglacial D2 deformation, the ice-proximal sands and gravels were \ncompletely overridden by ice, leading to deposition of a carapace of diamicton \ncovering these water-saturated sediments. The diamicton would have formed a \nrelatively impermeable cap, retarding water-escape and causing an increase in pore-\nwater pressure. Loading, exerted by the overriding ice, would have added to this \npressure increase. Consequently, subglacial D2 deformation of these water saturated \nsediments was characterised by liquefaction and soft-sediment deformation. The \nlarge-scale disruption of this part of the Drumbeg glacigenic sequence is therefore \ninterpreted as having been largely due to elevated water pressures and liquefaction, \nrather than high shear strains produced by the overriding ice. Evans and Hiemstra \n(2005) suggested that till deposition at Drumbeg was incremental and associated with \nan seasonally oscillating ice margin. These seasonal oscillations in the ice margin \n 26\nwould have accompanied a fluctuation in pore water content and pressure within the \nunderlying sedimentary sequence. \n \nThe shear zones, recognised by Phillips et al. (2002), which locally tectonically \nexcised parts of the already disrupted sequence, developed at a later stage of D2. At \nthe time, dewatering of the sedimentary pile would have allowed an increase in the \namount of shear transmitted into the glacier bed, where it was partitioned into discrete \nshear zones. One of these shear zones is developed along the contact between the ice-\nproximal sands and gravels, and the overlying diamicton (Fig. 15). Microstructures \ndeveloped within this shear zone include banded foliation, layer-parallel plasmic \nfabric in the clays; narrow shear bands defining ECC or SC fabrics and disharmonic \nfolds; as well as sand-filled hydrofractures that post-date the imposition of the main \nfoliation. However, a number of the more silty bands within this apparently highly \ndeformed zone are reverse-graded or homogenised due to localised liquefaction. The \npresence of soft-sediment deformation and liquefaction features within this shear zone \nsuggest that pore-water pressure continued to fluctuate and that the shear zones \npresented preferential sites for fluid pathways to develop allowing water to escape. \nThe injection of fluidised silt and sand into these actively deforming zones may also \nhave acted as a lubricant aiding displacement. The increase in pore-water pressure \nduring injection of this fluidised material into the shear zones could also have acted as \na hydraulic jack, resulting in the decoupling of the diamicton from the underlying \nsediments. One potential effect of this decoupling would be the rafting and \nimbrication of the diamicton during the later stages of D2 subglacial deformation.  \n \n7. Discussion \nSystematic micromorphological analysis represents a powerful tool for investigating \nthe often complex deformation histories recorded by sequence of glacigenic \nsediments. The detailed examination of the range of microstructures developed at \nRaitts Burn, Coire Mhic-sith, Glen Luibeg, Plumpe Farm and Drumbeg Quarry has \nprovided information regarding the nature of subglacial and\/or proglacial deformation \nrecorded by these sediments, beyond that can be gleaned from macroscopic \ninvestigations of the exposures in the field alone. A number of general conclusions \ncan be made: \n \n 27\n\u2022 A similar range of macro- and microstructures (folds, faults, hydrofractures, \ncrenulation cleavages, plasmic fabrics) has been observed in both subglacially \n(Raitts Burn, Coire Mhic-sith, Drumbeg) and proglacially (Glen Luibeg, \nDrumbeg) deformed sediments (Table 1). However, the results of the Scottish \nstudies suggest that soft-sediment deformation structures and features resulting \nfrom liquefaction and homogenisation may be more widely developed within \nsubglacially deformed sediments; \n \n\u2022 Similar progressive polyphase deformation histories have been recognised in \nthe deformed sequences exposed at Raitts Burn, Coire Mhic-sith, Glen Luibeg \nand Drumbeg (see Figs. 4, 8, 12 and 18). In general, this involves a phase of \nductile folding and thrusting, in response to initial ice-push, followed by \ncontinued thrusting and associated brittle faulting during further shortening \nwithin the sedimentary pile. The geometry of the array of normal and reverse \nfaults associated with the thrusts are consistent with them having formed as \nRiedel shears (Passchier and Trouw, 1996);  \n \n\u2022 At Raitts Burn deformation structures (thrusts, reverse faults) developed \nwithin the underlying sediments propagated upwards through these \nglaciolacustrine sediments to deform the base of the recently deposited \ndiamicton. This relationship was not observed\/preserved at any of the other \nsites. \n \n\u2022 The composition of the sediment plays an important role in the style and \nrelative intensity of deformation. The relatively weak, finely laminated clay-\nrich glaciolacustrine sediments at Raitts Burn, Coire Mhic-sith and Glen \nLuibeg preserve a range of fine-scale microstructures including folds and \nfaults. At Coire Mhic-sith and Glen Luibeg the clay-rich parts of the sequence \nformed a focus for thrusting, with, at least the early stages, of both subglacial \nand proglacial deformation (respectively) being partitioned into these weaker \nlayers. In contrast, the range of microstructures present within the sandy \nsequence at Drumbeg is more restricted in nature, with deformation being \ncharacterised by macroscopic folding and thrusting; \n 28\n \u2022 The partitioning of deformation was recognised at all sites and seen to be \nstrongly lithological controlled. For example, at Glen Luibeg early thrusting \nwas concentrated within the clay units;  \n \n\u2022 Plasmic fabrics are only developed within clay-rich sediments. The intensity \nof these fabrics varies with respect to the clay mineral content of the sediment \nand, therefore, should not be used as a general indicator of the comparative \nintensity of deformation; \n \n\u2022 At the sites examined the water content and pore-water pressure in the \nsediments increased during both subglacial and proglacial deformation. This \nincrease can occur at several stages during the progressive deformation and \nresults in varying degrees of liquefaction, hydrofracturing and homogenisation \nwithin the sedimentary pile; \n \n\u2022 The earliest sedimentary (bedding, S0) and deformation (S1) features can be \npreserved in low strain zones even within the most intensely deformed parts of \nthe glacigenic sequences; \n \n\u2022 On the microscopic scale, liquefaction and remobilisation mainly affected \ncoarse silt- and sand-grade sediments at Raitts Burn, Coire Mhic-sith and \nDrumbeg. This process locally led to the overprinting of earlier deformation \nstructures and homogenisation of the sediment. \n \nAt all the sites, the earliest deformation (D1) recorded by the sediments resulted in the \nimposition of a bedding-parallel S1 plasmic fabric within the clays. This bedding-\nparallel fabric can be recognised locally at all stratigraphic levels within the sequences \nexamined and is deformed by the other microstructures. Consequently, the \ndevelopment of the bedding-parallel S1 fabric occurred very early in the deformation \nhistory. At Raitts Burn, Phillips and Auton (2000) suggested that this pervasive fabric \ndeveloped in response to initial compaction\/loading by the overriding glacier. \nHowever, at Glen Luibeg, the glaciolacustrine to distal deltaic sediments have \n 29\nundergone proglacial deformation rather than subglacial deformation and were not \noverridden. It is possible that in this case, S1 developed in response to initial bedding-\nparallel shear prior to thrusting (see Fig. 15). Alternatively, the development of a \nbedding-parallel plasmic fabric can be unrelated to either proglacial or subglacial \ndeformation and simply records loading and compaction associated with initial \ndewatering of the sedimentary sequence during deposition (e.g. Plumpe Farm).  \n \nThe subglacially deformed sediments exposed at both Raitts Burn and Coire Mhic-\nsith record a progressive increase in the intensity and complexity of deformation \nupwards through the sequence towards the base of an overlying till. This is consistent \nwith the deforming bed model proposed by Boulton et al. (1974), Boulton and \nHindmarsh (1978) and Boulton and Jones (1979) to explain the movement of glaciers. \nIt is possible that the preservation of a systematic change in the style and intensity of \ndeformation upwards through the sequence may be a characteristic feature of \nsubglacial deformation. However, the glacially overridden succession present at \nPlumpe Farm does not show a comparable increase in the intensity of deformation \ntowards the base of the till. Micromorphological analysis and field observations \ntogether demonstrate that the fine-grained sediments of the Plumpe Sand and Gravel \nFormation are essentially undeformed. Microstructures present within the stratified \nbase of the Plumpe Bridge Till are consistent with this diamicton having had a high \nwater content at the time of deposition and deformation. This probably aided the \nmixing of the underlying fine-grained clayey sediments into the till and the formation \nof till pebble layers within the stratified base of the diamicton.  \n \nDuring the Scottish Readvance, the flat-lying, ice-marginal glaciofluvial and \nglaciolacustrine sediments seen at Plumpe Farm were thought to have been saturated \nin water, aiding the advance of the ice across the Solway basin. In contrast to the \nupland sites which are confined to small narrow basins cut in resistant, relatively \nimpermeable bedrock, the Plumpe Farm site is located in a broad, flat-lying basin \nclose to sea-level and with a regionally high water table, resulting in long lived wet \nconditions. The development of a water-lubricated surface at the base of the ice \ndramatically reduced the amount of shear translated into the underlying sediments. \nDisplacement focused into this water-rich zone, leading to the observed disharmonic \nfolding and soft-sediment deformation. The lack of any obvious deformation within \n 30\nthe Plumpe Bridge Till suggests that this water-rich zone was maintained throughout \nthe readvance and till deposition. This may have been due to poorly drained, clay-rich \nnature of the sediments below the ice. \n \nAt Raitts Burn, Phillips and Auton (2000) suggested that the early stages of ice \nmovement across an ice-dammed lake also occurred on a water-lubricated surface. \nThe result was that only a minor amount of shear was translated into the underlying \nsediments during the early stages (D1 to D3) of deformation (see Fig. 6). A \nsubsequent fall in pore-water pressure, following a phase of hydrofracturing, sediment \nfluidisation and water-escape (D3; Fig. 6), led to an increase in both the cohesive \nstrength of the sediments and amount of shear translated into the bed of the glacier. \nThe result was the observed increase in the intensity of deformation (D4; Fig. 6) in the \nupper part of the glaciolacustrine sequence. The continued presence (Plumpe Farm) or \ndemise (Raitts Burn) of a water-rich zone at the base of the glacier as it overrides a \nsequence of water-saturated sediments must be controlled by: (a) the permeability of \nthe sediments within its bed; and (b) the ability of water to drain from these sediments \nat the front of the advancing glacier. The confined, poorly drained nature of subglacial \nenvironments, such as that at Plumbe Farm, may therefore lead to the development of \nwater-saturated detachments within the sediment pile effectively \u2018switching off\u2019 \npervasive subglacial deformation and potentially the decoupling of the glacier from its \nbed. \n \nMicrotextural evidence from the subglacially deformed sediments at Raitts Burn, and \nCoire Mhic-sith, and proglacially deformed sediments in the lower part of the \nsequence exposed at Drumbeg Quarry reveal that the pore-water pressure and content \nof the sediments fluctuated during deformation at each site. At Raitts Burn the clay-\nlined normal (D3) faults (Fig. 3), sand- and clay-filled hydrofractures (Figs. 4 and 5), \nsoft-sediment deformation structures (convolute lamination, disharmonic folds; Fig. \n5), and the accompanying liquefaction of the sandy layers, all record an increase in \nthe pore-water pressure during deformation (D1 to D3; Fig. 6). Brecciation associated \nwith the hydrofractures and jigsaw-like breccia at the tip of one of the normal faults \nrecord the flow of overpressured subglacial groundwater through the sediments (cf. \nBoulton and Caban, 1995; Phillips and Auton, 2000). Brecciation of the clays during \nliquefaction of interbedded sand laminae was also observed at Coire Mhic-sith. The \n 31\nhighly deformed silts and clays immediately below the till, are invaded by a network \nof sand-filled veins and hydrofractures (Fig. 10). During liquefaction, sand was \ninjected along the earlier formed (D2) faults, the latter initially acting as fluid \npathways aiding water-escape. However, pore-water pressure apparently continued to \nrise until it exceeded the cohesive strength of the adjacent clays leading to \nhydrofracturing and associated brecciation. A similar structural control on the pattern \nof water-escape was locally provided by the domainal S1 cleavage developed axial \nplanar to the NE-verging F1 folds associated with proglacial deformation of the \ndeltaic sediments exposed at Drumbeg Quarry. Sand-filled water-escape conduits \nwere injected along the lower strain domains of this cleavage.  \n \nResults of these studies indicate that although structures associated with soft-sediment \ndeformation and liquefaction are not indicative of subglacial deformation they may be \nvery widespread in glacial overridden sedimentary sequences. High pore-water \npressures and contents leading to water saturated conditions within the sedimentary \npile are more likely to develop within confined, poorly drained subglacial to \nsubmarginal settings. Whereas, in proglacial settings, although drainage may be \ntemporarily impeded, hydrofracturing and water-escape will effectively prevent such \nconditions developing.  The rise in pore-water pressure during subglacial deformation \nat both Raitts Burn and Coire Mhic-sith is most likely to have been due to the increase \nin overburden pressure induced by overriding ice. At Drumbeg, the proglacial setting \nof the earlier (D1) phase of deformation and sandy nature of the sediments means \nthat, at least initially, they would have been able to dewater relatively easily. The \ntectonic thickening of the sedimentary pile during deformation, however, led to \nconsolidation of the sediments and an increase in pore-water pressure. The local \npresence of thin silt and clay interbeds also formed temporary impermeable barriers \nimpeding water-escape. The progressive development of the S1 fabric during \ndeformation provided a fluid pathway, allowing trapped pore-water to escape.  \n \nField and micromorphological observations demonstrate that there is a marked \ncontrast in the style of proglacial (D1) and subglacial (D2) deformation recorded by \nthe ice-proximal sediments exposed at Drumbeg Quarry. This difference in style can \nbe related to the water content of the sediments at the time of deformation. The \nsubaqueous depositional environment of Lake Blane meant that the Drumbeg deposits \n 32\nwould have been water-saturated during both D1 and D2 readvances of the Loch \nLomond glacier. As noted above, the proglacial setting of D1 and sandy nature of the \nsediments would have aided dewatering during deformation. The composition of the \nsediments affected by D1 and D2 are similar (i.e. sand-rich). Consequently, the \nobserved differences in the style of deformation are thought to be related to \ndifferences between the water content and pore-water pressure during each \ndeformation episode. In contrast to D1, macro- and microstructures developed during \nD2 are consistent with soft-sediment deformation and liquefaction of water-saturated \nsediments. The deposition of an impermeable layer of till at the base of the overriding \nice during D2 would have retarded drainage and water-escape. The resultant increase \nin pore-water pressure within these already water-rich sediments, coupled with the \nload exerted by the overriding ice, led to the observed large-scale disruption. \nAnastomosing shear zones, tectonically excise parts of this already disrupted \nsequence. These shear zones developed at a later stage of D2 when the sedimentary \npile had begun to dewater, possibly reflecting renewed drainage from the front of the \nglacier. Microstructures developed within the shear zones indicate that they acted as \nfluid pathways, showing that pore-water pressure continued to fluctuate. The injection \nof pulses of fluidised sediment into these actively deforming zones would have acted \nas a lubricant, aiding displacement and possibly resulting in the decoupling of the \ndiamicton from the underlying sediments. The shear zones would have acted as fluid \npathways aiding the dewatering of the sedimentary pile. \n \n8. Subglacial versus Proglacial deformation ? \n \nIt is clear from the above discussion that micromorphological analysis is an important \ntool when attempting to unravel the detailed deformation history recorded by \ndeformed glacigenic sequences. Care must be taken, however, to integrate the \nmicromorphological data with wider palaeoenvironmental observations (notably on \nthe direction of ice advance and retreat). The results of this study show that a similar \nrange of deformation structures can be developed in both proglacial and subglacial \nglacitectonic environments (Table 1). The structures, which include a variety of folds, \nfaults, plasmic fabrics and crenulation cleavages, are developed on a range of scales \n(macroscopic to microscopic) with their inter-relationships allowing the progressive \nand\/or polyphase nature of the deformation history to be established (Menzies 2000, \n 33\nvan der Wateren et al., 2000; Phillips and Auton, 2000, Phillips et al., 2002; this \nstudy). However, rather than the glacitectonic setting representing the sole controlling \nfactor, the composition and water content of the sediment has been found, in most \ncases, to be the dominant influence on the style and apparent intensity of deformation.  \n \nSoft-sediment deformation, hydrofracturing, liquefaction and homogenisation can \noccur in both subglacially and proglacially deformed sequences (Golledge, 2002; \nRijsdijk et al., 1999; Baroni and Fasano, 2006). However, the Scottish examples \nsuggest that, although not indicative of subglacial deformation, structures equated \nwith high pore-water pressure and\/or content may be more widely\/pervasively \ndeveloped in subglacially deformed sediments. In both environments pore-water \npressure builds up during deformation and may lead to repeated phases\/episodes of \nliquefaction, hydrofracturing and water-escape (e.g. Raitts Burn, Coire Mhic-sith, \nDrumbeg). Earlier developed structures, such as faults, folds and cleavages, may \ncontrol the sites of later water-escape (e.g. F1 folds at Drumbeg), with these early \nstructures locally being overprinted as a result of liquefaction and homogenisation.  \n \nThe confined nature of the subglacial environment may allow water-saturated \nconditions to be maintained resulting relatively wide spread liquefaction and \ndisruption of the sediment pile (e.g. Unit II at Drumbeg), and\/or the development of \nwater lubricated detachments within the sedimentary pile (e.g. Plumpe Farm, high \nstrain zones at Drumbeg). At Plumbe Farm, the water-saturated detachment developed \nat the base of the till appears to have accommodated most if not all the shear imposed \nby the overriding Southern Uplands glacier ice. The partitioning of deformation into \nthis water-lubricated detachment would have resulted in a dramatic lowering of the \namount of shear transmitted into the underlying sediments protecting it from \ndeformation. The development of such detachments, however, may occur at a deeper \nlevel within the sediment pile or even within the underlying bedrock (see Bluemle and \nClayton 1984; Truffer et al., 2000; Truffer and Harrison, 2006), with the detached \nsediments being transported, relatively undeformed, within the hanging-wall of these \nstructures. However, the development of a water-saturated detachment is not \nindicative of subglacial deformation as similar features have been noted within the \nshear zones developed at the base of mass flow deposits (Lachniet et al., 1999; \nLachniet et al., 2001; Phillips, 2006). \n 34\n  \n9. Conclusions \n \nThe study of the structures in subglacially and proglacially deformed sediments has \nbeen providing important information on the signature of each type of glacier-induced \ndeformation. Micromorphological studies carried out on a number of sites in a variety \nof geological and topographical settings throughout Scotland have demonstrated that a \nsimilar range of both macroscopic and microstructures can be developed in both \nglacitectonic environments. Consequently, no unequivocal discrimination can be \nmade between the subglacially and proglacially deformed sediments based upon this \ntype of evidence alone. However, the Scottish studies suggest that soft-sediment \ndeformation and structures related to liquefaction and water-escape may be more \nwidely developed within the subglacial rather than in the proglacial environment. A \nmultidisciplinary approach, involving sedimentological, geomorphological and \nstructural field observations, combined with micromorphological analysis, is needed \nto unravel the full glacitectonic history and depositional environment of most \ndeformed glacigenic sedimentary sequences. Examination of the microstructures \n(folds, faults, thrusts, crenulations, hydrofractures and plasmic fabrics) may aid in \nunderstanding the often polyphase deformation histories recorded by these sequences. \nFurthermore, kinematic indicators, such as the asymmetry of shear fabrics and folds, \nas well as the sense of off-set on faults, can not only be used to reconstruct palaeo-ice \nmovement directions but to test palaeoenvironmental reconstructions derived from \nmore traditional \u2018field based\u2019 observations.  \n \nThe multidisciplinary studies of these Scottish Quaternary sites have also shown that \nsediment composition, water content and pore-water pressure are important \ncontrolling factors influencing the style and apparent intensity of deformation \nrecorded. Changes in pore-water content and pressure during both proglacial and \nsubglacial deformation can lead to liquefaction and hydrofracturing, with early \nformed structures locally controlling the pattern of water escape. Liquefaction can \nalso lead to homogenisation of the sediments, overprinting of earlier deformation \nstructures. Beds or zones of fluidised sediment commonly form highly lubricated \ndetachments within the sedimentary pile, partitioning the deformation and resulting in \na marked reduction in the amount of shear transmitted to underlying units.  \n 35\n Although micromorphological analysis is a powerful tool in glacial deformation \nstudies where possible it should be used as part of a multidisciplinary approach, \ninvolving sedimentological, geomorphological and structural field observations, when \nattempting to unravel the glacitectonic history and depositional environment of \ndeformed glacigenic sedimentary sequences. \n \n10.
