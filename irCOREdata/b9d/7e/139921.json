We show by theoretical analysis\nand experimental measurements that by bonding thin film piezoelectric samples to a\nsubstantial holder the substrate bending can be minimized to a negligible level. Once the\nsubstrate bending can be effectively eliminated, single beam laser scanning vibrometry can be\nused to measure the precise strain distribution of a piezoelectric thin film under converse\nactuation. A significant strain increase toward the inside edge of the top electrode (assuming\na fully covered bottom electrode) and a corresponding strain peak in the opposite direction\njust outside the electrode edge were observed. These peaks were found to increase with the\nincreasing Poisson\u2019s ratio and transversal piezoelectric coefficient of the piezoelectric thin\nfilm. This is due to the non-continuity of the electric field at the edge of the top electrode,\nwhich leads to the concentration of shear stress and electric field in the vicinity of the\nelectrode edge. The measured d33,f was found to depend not only on the material properties\nsuch as the electromechanical coefficients of the piezoelectric thin films or elastic coefficients\nof the thin film and the substrate, but also on the geometry factors such as the thickness of the\npiezoelectric films, the dimensions of the electrode, and also the thickness of the substrate.\n3I. INTRODUCTION\nPiezoelectric films especially lead zirconate titanate (PZT) have attracted considerable\nattention1 recently because they can provide functionality for micro-electromechanical\nsystems (MEMS) devices such as micromotors2, micropumps3, and chemical sensors4.\nAccurate knowledge of the piezoelectric coefficients dij of the films is essential for the\neffective devices modelling and design and process qualification, but their accurate\nmeasurement is by no means straightforward. Large discrepancies exist among the reported\nfilm piezoelectric coefficients in the literature and these cannot be explained simply by\ninconsistence of film quality and varies measurement techniques.5 It is well known that the\nlongitudinal piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of thin films differ from that of bulk materials,\nhence it is denoted as d33,f . If no lateral strain is possible due to the substrate clamping, then:\n)(3133,33 1211\n132 EE\nE\nss\nsc\nf ddd \uf02b\uf02d\uf03d (1)\nWhere the sij are the unclamped mechanical compliances of the piezoelectric film, d31 is the\nunclamped transverse piezoelectric coefficient and c fd ,33 is called the constrained piezoelectric\ncoefficient 6.\nExtensive efforts have been made to measure the fd ,33 in the past. One of the main\ndifficulties associated with measuring fd ,33 , is how to overcome substrate bending caused by\nthe transverse strain of the actuated piezoelectric film. The \u2018Berlincourt meter\u2019 measuring the\ndirect piezoelectric effect is usually used for bulk ceramics and is not suited to measuring thin\nfilms. It is very difficult to produce a homogeneous uni-axial stress on a thin film deposited\non thick substrate, without also generating a bending effect, which produces a large amount of\ncharge through the transverse piezoelectric effect 7. To reduce the substrate interactions\n4modifications such as pneumatic pressure rig 8 and sample flexure 9, 10 techniques have been\ndeveloped. The use of piezo-response force microscopy (PFM) measurements for those films\nwith deposited top electrodes may also suffer from the substrate bending effect As for PFM\nfor films without a top electrode; it detects the local vibrations induced by a testing sinusoidal\nsignal, applied between the conductive tip of the atomic force microscopes cantilever and the\nbottom electrode of the film. Since the radius of the tip apex is in the range of tens of\nnanometres, the measured piezoelectric response is grain dependent. For some grains, the\ncontribution from d15 may be significant, and the measured out-of-plane piezoelectric\nresponse could be substantially different from the effective value along the poling direction.11\nSingle beam laser interferometry techniques have difficulty in separating the bending of the\nsubstrate from the thickness dilatation of films. Double-beam interferometers have been\nsuggested as a technique to compensate for the bending of the substrate.12, 13 Dual beam\ninterferometry is believed by many to be a reliable technique to measure the fd ,33 despite it\nnot being the most user friendly technique, as it requires a stable environment and has a\nrelatively large spot size. Some additional problems are the requirement of high reflectivity\nfor both the front and back surfaces which makes it difficult if not impossible for the\nmeasurement of porous thick films. Moreover, if the front and back side beams are not\naligned precisely, to be coincident, then substrate bending can contribute substantially to the\nmeasured displacement (this will be discussed further in section 2).\nLaser scanning vibrometry (LSV) is becoming more popular for d33,f measurements,14 due\npartly to the ease of use and the capability of phase related surface scanning measurements.\nLSV can work in a normal laboratory environment and does not require the sample surface to\nhave a very high reflectivity. LSV measures vibration velocity, which when integrated gives\nthe displacement of the sample.\n5Recent works on the finite element modelling of the piezo-response of piezoelectric thin\nfilms, suggest that the vertical displacement of the top surface of the film when activated by\nan electric voltage, is the congruence of a number of contributions, such as: the intrinsic\npiezo-strain, the strain induced by the substrate constraints, the local deformation of the\nsubstrate and the top and bottom electrodes, and substrate bending. It is well recognized that\nthe substrate bending displacement could be several times that of the intrinsic piezo-strain,\ntherefore it has to be eliminated completely or compensated for in the measurement.12, 13 The\nsubstrate constraint induced strain is dependent upon the exact boundary conditions, and\ndiminishes if the top electrode dimension is much smaller than the film thickness.15, 16 The\neffect of the top electrode is negligible if the film is fully or free from constraint with the\nsubstrate.16 The local deformation of the bottom electrode and substrate is much more\ncomplex and could account for more than 70% of the measured displacement.15 Further\ndetailed modelling has revealed that the local deformation depends on the dimension of the\ntop electrode, film thickness and also the ratio between the two.5, 17 Only when the dimension\nof the top electrode exceeds a certain size (a few mm) can the measured piezoelectric\ncoefficient d33,f converge to the constrained\nc\nfd ,33 .\n17\nThe requirement for the top electrode to be larger than a few mm has serious implications\nsince many MEMS devices are less than one mm in all critical dimensions. Also the chance\nof an electrical short in some thin films, such as those prepared by sol-gel, significantly\nincreases when top electrodes are larger than 1 mm due to the existence of pin-holes. The\nconclusions from the numerical modelling posses a series questions such as: Can this be\nconfirmed by experiments? Are there other factors which also affect the measured piezo-\ncoefficient?\nIn this manuscript we report the analysis, modelling and LSV measurement of piezoelectric\nthin film behaviour under activation with an electric field. We show that the effect of\n6substrate bending can be eliminated by bonding the back of thin film samples to a large mass.\nThe dependence of the measured piezoelectric coefficients on the size of the top electrode is\ndemonstrated and compared to numerical modelling results. Factors affecting the line profile\nof piezo-response across the diameter of the top electrode are also discussed.\nII. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS\nA. Substrate bending without bonding\nWhen an electric field E3 is applied to a piezoelectric film deposited on a substrate, it bends\ndue to the transversal piezoelectric effect d31 (Figure 1(a)). By making the assumption that\nthe specimen is a strip, it can be treated as a unimorph beam simplifying the analysis.18, 19\nAssuming the specimen is simply supported, the curvature \uf06b of the bending can be calculated\nby:\npt\nE\nd\nBBBABA\nBAB 3\n313242 1)232(2\n)1(6 \uf0d7\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\n\uf02b\uf03d\uf06b (2)\nThe bending displacement \uf064 at L1 (Figure 1(a)) is:\n3313242\n2\n12\n1 1)232(2\n)1(6\n22\n1\nEd\nBBBABA\nBAB\nt\nL\nL\np\n\uf0d7\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\n\uf02b\uf0d7\uf03d\uf03d \uf06b\uf064 (3)\nAnd the slope \uf061 at the L1 is:\n3313242\n1\n1 1)232(2\n)1(6\nEd\nBBBABA\nBAB\nt\nL\nL\np\n\uf0d7\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\n\uf02b\uf0d7\uf03d\uf03d \uf06b\uf061 (4)\n7The displacement between L2 and L1 is \uf061 (L2-L1) (Figure 1(a)) and the total displacement at\nL2 is:\n\uf044 = \uf064+ \uf061 (L2-L1) (5)\nWhere pm YYA \/\uf03d , pm ttB \/\uf03d , Ym is the Young\u2019s modulus of the substrate layer, Yp is the\nYoung\u2019s modulus of piezoelectric layer, tm the thickness of the substrate layer and tp the\nthickness of the piezoelectric layer.\nFor a typical specimen, comprising PZT as the piezoelectric material and silicon (Si) as the\nsubstrate with typical values of: Ym= 130 Gpa, Yp= 80 Gpa, tm = 0.25 mm, tp = 0.001 mm, L1=\n1 mm, L2 = 10 mm, E3= 1 MV, and d31=100 pm\/V. This gives \uf06b~6x10-3 m-1, \uf064~3 nm, \uf061(L2-L1)\n~53 nm, and \uf044 ~56 nm! For a d31=100 pm\/V assuming the d33,f ~100 pm\/V or smaller\ntherefore the thickness dilatation is 100 pm, meaning the contribution from the bending\ndisplacement is much larger than the longitudinal piezoelectric displacement. This analysis\nagrees with the conclusions obtained in literature where it was assumed that the top electrode\ncovers the whole top surface of the PZT.13\nIf the front and back beams are perfectly aligned during double beam interferometry, substrate\nbending should not contribute anything to the measured displacement. However, if there is a\nmisalignment of ls, the measured displacement also includes a contribution from the bending\neffect. This can be estimated from (3). Assuming the front beam is at the centre and the back\nside beam is misaligned by ls= 0.2 mm, using the parameters the same as in the previous\nparagraph and notice B>>1, then the bending contribution \uf064s\n~\n3312\n2\n4\n6\n2\nEd\nBABt\nl\np\ns \uf0d7\n\uf02b\n\uf0d7 ~ 331\n2\n4\n3\nEd\nABt\nl\nm\ns \uf0d7\n\uf02b\n\uf0d7 ~120pm, which is more than the thickness\ndilatation! So the precise alignment of the back and front beams is of critical importance to\n8the accurate measurement of the piezoelectric coefficient for thin films using the double-beam\ninterferometer technique.\nB. Substrate bending of glue bonding device to a sample holder\nThe above estimation has assumed that the specimen was simply supported on the sample\nholder. If however the back of the substrate is bonded to a rigid sample holder, we can show\nthat the bending of the substrate is dramatically reduced, and can be considered to be\nnegligible.\nWhen a positive voltage is applied to the sample, an upward bending moment Meq is induced\nand the specimen moves upward until it is counter-balanced by the stretched bonding layer\n(for example, acrylate glue). The bonding layer can be considered as a spring with the spring\nconstant\nephcAk \/\uf03d , where A is the contact area of the acrylate glue with the substrate.\n20, 21\nFor simplicity assuming the maximum displacement of the bottom of the wafer at the edge of\nthe top electrode (L1) is Z0 and the displacement is a linear function of the distance from the\norigin (Figure 1(b)). So the displacement at a position x within the top electrode is xZ0\/L1.\nConsidering a small area wepdx where wep is the width of the acrylate glue layer and dx is a\nsmall length at the position x. Then the force produced by the acrylate glue area wepdx which\nacts upon the specimen is xcwepZ0\/hepL1dx and the moment is x2cwepZ0\/hepL1. Between L1 and\nL2, the displacement is (L2-x)Z0\/(L2-L1), the force is (L2-x)cwepZ0\/hep(L2-L1)dx and the moment\nis x(L2-x)cwepZ0\/hep(L2-L1)dx. The total moment by the acrylate glue layer is M and:\n)(\n6\n1\n)(\n21\n2\n20\n12\n0\n2\n0 1\n02\n2\n1\n1\nLLLZ\nh\ncw\ndx\nLL\nZ\nh\ncw\nxLxdx\nL\nZ\nh\ncw\nxM\nep\nep\nL\nL ep\nep\nL\nep\nep\n\uf02b\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d \uf0f2\uf0f2\n(6)\n9The equivalent bending moment Meq can be obtained by unimorph theory:18\n\uf028 \uf029\n331\n2\n331\n2\n)1(\n)1(2\n4\n1)1(\n2\n4\nEd\nAB\nBABtwY\nEd\nBAB\nABYwt\nM\npp\np\neq\n\uf0d7\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\uf0d7\uf03d\n\uf0d7\n\uf02b\uf02b\n\uf0d7\uf03d\n(7)\nWhere t = tm + tp.

The minimum acrylate glue width used to bond the\nsample to the substrate is the width of the top electrode w and usually wep>>w, roughly d31 \uf07e\nd33,f, so the maximum value between the peak back surface displacement Z0 and the\npiezoelectric displacement is no more than 1%. If the acrylate glue width is greater than the\nwidth of the top electrode which is usually the case, this ratio is even smaller. This indicates\nthat the sample bending effect can be safely ignored if the specimen is glued to a rigid sample\nholder. Experimental work on low electromechanical coupling thin films reported in the\nliterature supports the above analysis, Muensit and Guy were able to obtained d33= 2.0 pm\/V\nfor gallium nitride thin films by gluing the specimen to a thick brass plate, which was in turn\nrigidly attached to an optical stage.22 Lueng et al. measured d33=2.13 pm\/V for gallium\n10\nnitride thin films with a heterodyne interferometer.23 They used silver epoxy to glue the Si\nsubstrate to an aluminium block which in turn was rigidly attached to a translation stage.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL\nA. Device fabrication\nA Sol-Gel PZT was synthesized using: lead acetate trihydrate, zirconium propoxide and\ntitanium butoxide precursors. The precursors were stoichiometrically mixed and refluxed in a\nsolution of acetic acid and methanol. The lead excess was fixed at 10 and 20% for final\ncompositions of Pb1.1(Zr0.30Ti0.70)O3 and Pb1.2(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 respectively, the lead excess\ncounteracts lead loss during pyrolysis and subsequent high temperature annealing. The sols\nwere diluted to 0.4M with acetic acid based on lead concentration, which fixes the thickness\nper layer at approximately 70 nm when spin coated at 3000 rpm.\nA 350 \uf06dm thick double side polished <100> Si wafer, with a surface oxide (SiO2) of 200 nm,\nwas platinised using sputtering in a Nordiko RF\/DC sputtering machine, 8 nm of RF sputtered\ntitanium was used as an adhesion layer for the 100 nm thick DC sputtered platinum which\nacts as both bottom electrode and seeding layer for the PZT film. A 1.1 \uf06dm thick film of the\nPb1.2(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 and a 2\uf06dm thick film of the Pb1.1(Zr0.30Ti0.70)O3 were grown upon the\nplatinised Si wafers by; spin coating a PZT layer at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds, followed by\npyrolisation at 350\u00b0C, then annealing at 560\u00b0C for 5 minutes to fully crystallize the layer, this\ncycle was then repeated 15 times to give a layer of 1.1 \uf06dm, the orientation of the PZT films\nwas determined using a \uf071-2\uf071 X-ray diffraction measurement with a Siemens D5005\ndiffractometer with a Cu-K\uf061 source. A lift-off lithography process incorporating LOR2A and\nS1818 resists was used to deposit a patterned top electrode with the thicknesses as the bottom\nelectrode\/seed layer. Following the deposition of the top electrode and subsequent lift off, the\nwafer was RF sputter coated with a blanket layer of gold 200 nm thick, a 2.5 \uf06dm thick resist\n11\nmask was patterned upon the gold layer using the image reversal resist AZ5214E to provide a\nmould. 1 \uf06dm of nickel was then electroplated into the resist mould which was then stripped\ngiving a hard metal mask for the reactive ion etching (RIE) of the PZT film. The exposed\ngold and the PZT film was etched using RIE with 120 watts power in Ar and CHF3 gasses,\nwhich gave an etch rate of 1.7 nm\/min for a total etch time of approximately 11 hours. After\nthe etching of the PZT, the hard mask was removed by wet etching the nickel in ferric\nchloride, and removing the gold in potassium iodide and iodine. The wafer was then\npatterned using AZ4562 resist to RIE etch the bottom electrode and the surface oxide with Ar\nand CHF3, O2 gasses respectively. After this the wafer was patterned on the back face using\nthe same image reversal technique as the front to allow the sputter deposition and subsequent\nlift off of a 100 nm thick aluminium layer which acts as the hard mask for deep RIE with SF6\nand C4F8 through the Si wafer to release the devices. The final step was the O2 plasma ashing\nof the protective resist on the front of the wafer and chemical cleaning using acetone and\nisopropanol alcohol. A Schematic of the side elevation and an image of the device are shown\nin figure 2.\nAfter processing, the devices were checked to make sure they were viable by measuring their\nelectrical properties (loss and phase) using a Wayne Kerr 6425 precision component analyser.\nThe passed devices were then contact poled using 130\u00b0C for 5 minutes with an electric field\nof 15 MV\/m.\nB. Device mounting\nThe glues for bonding the devices to a substantial substrate were chosen to be UV cured, the\nreason for this is that UV curable glue has a long working time in a yellow light clean room.\nThe chosen glues were from DELO industrial adhesives, DELO-PHOTOBOND 4468 and\nGB310 which have a young\u2019s modulus of 250 and 1600 MPa respectively. A 100 mm\ndiameter glass plate was coated with glue by spin coating at 2000 rpm, the devices were\n12\nplaced on the plate which was then loaded into a Karl Suss MA56 mask aligner which UV\ncured the adhesive using hard contact mode to give the thinnest possible layer of glue\n(approximately 2 \uf06dm for GB310).\nC. d33,f Measurement\nThe Polytec vibrometer system (MSV300) is a modified Mach-Zehnder type interferometer\nbased on the Doppler frequency shift. The d33,f was measured using the MSV300 laser\nvibrometer of the Polytec MMA 300, using a single HeNe laser beam focussed through a\n1.25x objective giving a field of view approximately 7 mm2. Because the samples were thin\nfilm materials, their optical reflectance was excellent and the return signal observed on the\nvibrometer from the surface was close to 100%. This gave a very good signal to noise ratio,\nwith the noise floor being < 1pm at 9 kHz (figure 3).\nThe actuating signal was set at 1.8 Vp-p to avoid second harmonic generation of non linear\neffects in the piezoelectric material, which have a destabilising effect on the d33,f measured at\nthe actuated frequency as is shown in figure 4. A sample was actuated with 1 to 8 volts\napplied signal (2.4 - 22.6 Vp-p), investigation of the data shows only the measurements from\n1-3 V have a linear increase in the displacement. The measurements were performed within a\nfrequency window of 20 kHz allowing the appearance of a second harmonic at twice the\nfundamental frequency with 3 V applied signal (figure 3). Each measurement point in the\ngrid for a scan or any single point measurement was averaged over 20 cycles, using complex\naveraging.\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nA piezoelectric thin film sample with a 500 \uf06dm top electrode was measured prior to being\nconstrained by glue bonding to a substrate (figure 5 (un-bonded)). It is evident from figure 5\nthat there is over ten times displacement contribution from substrate bending, when the\n13\ndisplacement is compared to that of the same sample after it has been bonded to a substrate\n(figure 5 (bonded)). The unsymmetrical appearance of the trace in figure 5 (un-bonded) is\ndue to point clamping of the sample by the contacting probes, the positions of the two probes\nhave been delineated by the dots upon the trace. The two vertical lines show the position of\nthe top electrode, and it is clear from the trace that there is a linear nature to the substrate\nbending outside the top electrode.\nFigure 5 (bonded) shows the LSV measured surface displacement profile across the top\nelectrode for the same sample after its back was bonded to the sample holder. As for figure 5\n(bonded), it is evident from the profile that the substrate away from the actuated (top\nelectrode) area of the piezoelectric is flat having near zero bending, with ripples within the\nnoise floor of the vibrometer < 1 pm. This confirms our analytical conclusion, that, by\nbonding a thin film specimen to a large mass substrate bending would be reduced. However,\nthe displacement profile across the top electrode is not flat, as can be seen from both figure 4\nand 5, there is a significant strain increase toward the inside edge of the top electrode and a\ncorresponding strain peak in the opposite direction just outside the electrode edge.\nThe positioning dependence in the displacement across the top electrode gives rise to\nconfusion as to what should be defined as the d33,f. We defined d33,f as equal to the\ndisplacement at the centre (A) (all captions for position reference shown in figure 4) of the\nelectroded area with respect to the stationary substrate (D) outside the electroded region.24, 25\nBut it could also be defined as the difference between positions A to C as suggested in, or\neven B to C.14 We have used, described below, finite element modelling (FEM) ANSYS to\nreveal the mechanisms by which the piezoelectric stack is deformed at the edges of the\nelectrode upon actuation. A parametric analysis was performed to investigate the influence of\nd31, d15 and Poisson\u2019s ratio \uf06e in the generation of the shape of the actuated structure. The\nmaterial properties for Ferroperm\u2019s PZ23 which were used for the PZT; and the Si properties,\n14\nare shown in table 1. The formulae26 used to vary the Poisson\u2019s ratio for a strain in the 3\ndirection is\n11\n12\nS\nS\nv\n\uf02d\uf03d , the 2D compliance (Sij) matrix, was input directly into ANSYS to\nmodel the behaviour of the unique shapes at the edge of the PZT layer. Particular attention\nwas paid to the increased longitudinal displacement at the inside edge (B) of the electrode\nproducing a peak, and an anti-phase peak seen at the outside edge (C) of the electrode in\nfigure 4. Numerical calculation has shown that there is a significant concentration of shear\nstress and electric field at the edge of the top electrode which leads to the displacement\npeaking at B25, 27-29, but little has been discussed about its anti-phase peak at C.\nThe modelling has shown that there is no significant contribution from d15 (with electrode\ndiameters >10 \uf06dm) to the appearance of the peaks at the edge of the electrode, but that both\nthe Poisson\u2019s ratio \uf06e and d31 do contribute to the effect. Figure 6 shows the modelling results\nfor PZT with different Poisson\u2019s ratios whilst all other parameters were kept constant. It is\nevident that the Poisson\u2019s ratio of the piezoelectric material has a large impact on the\ngeneration of the two peaks at the edge of the electrode. The original Poisson\u2019s ratio of the\nmaterial used for the modelling is 0.34, as this increases the d33,f decreases and the peaks\nbecome more pronounced as shown by the trace with a Poisson\u2019s ratio of 0.435. If it is\nreduced to 0.01, as can be seen in figure 6, then the d33,f value of -297 pm\/V is very close to\nthe d33 (-327 pm\/V) of the material used in the model. Notice the peak and the anti-phase\npeak at two sides of the edge of the top electrode appear in pairs: when there is no peak at the\nposition B, no anti-phase peak exists at the position C.\nThe same parametric modelling was performed varying d31 whilst all other parameter were\nkept constant, the results which are shown in figure 7 show a similar trend as that of figure 6\nwhere Poisson\u2019s ratio was varied, but in figure 7 the d33,f more closely resembles the materials\nd33 as is suggested by (1). Again the peak at B and the anti-phase peak at C at the edges of the\n15\ntop electrode appear in pairs, suggesting they are both related to the concentration of electric\nfield and shear stress at the vicinity of the edge of the electrode. Therefore they should not be\nconsidered in the definition of d33,f. From these considerations, d33,,f is best to be defined as\nthe displacement at the centre A of the electrode relative to the stationary substrate D outside\nthe electroded region. According to this definition the d33,f is 30 pm\/V in Figure 5.\nThe displacement profiles across top electrode were found to depend on the size of the top\nelectrode. Samples with 11 different sizes of top electrode, range from 0.3 to 2.0 mm in\ndiameter, were fabricated and poled under exactly the same conditions. Figure 8 shows three\nrepresenting displacement profiles with different top electrode diameters. When the\ndiameters were 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 mm the displacement profile across the top electrode was\nalmost flat. When the top electrode size was increased further, displacement peaks at the\nedge of the electrode started to appear, and there is congruence as the height of the peaks\nincreases with the increased diameter of the top electrode.\nThe measured d33,f as a function of the diameter of the top electrode is shown in figure 9.\nWhen the electrode was small (0.3 mm), the specimen showed the highest d33,f, and it\ndecreased with the increasing size of the electrode until the electrode diameter reached 1.1\nmm in this study. After that, further increase of the electrode size lead to the increased d33,f,\nuntil it conformed to a value when the electrode diameter is larger than 1.5 mm for our thin\nfilm specimens. This feature of non-monotonic dependence on the electrode size agrees with\nprevious FEM results5, 17 qualitatively, but further effort on FEM modelling using different\nelastic and electromechanical material parameters and actual sample dimensions failed to\nproduce a profile matching exactly the measurement results shown in figure 9. Although the\nmaximum and minimum displacements were matched, the FEM minima of the displacement\nalways appeared at around the 0.1 mm electrode diameter, rather than the experimental value\nof 1.1 mm. Reasons for this discrepancy are not clear. A possible explanation is related to\n16\nthe poling of the thin films. Numerical calculations have shown concentrations of electrical\nfield and shear stress at the edge of top electrode and the existence of electric fields\nimmediately outside the top electrode area with directions from angles to almost\nperpendicular to the z-direction.27, 29 FEM considers the piezoelectric to be perfectly poled in\nthe z-direction due to the way the material properties are entered into the model. When a\nmodel is solved we can see the edge displacement features due to the interaction of the\nelectric field with the d31 and the Poisson\u2019s ratio. What is not considered is that the\nexperimental device is poled with the same radiating electric field, which would give rise to a\nd33 effect along the horizontal direction outside the top electrode area. This could create both\nan increase in the effective dimensions of the top electrode (which is non trivial in a system\nmeasured in microns) and strain relationships outside the top electrode opposite those inside\nthe top electrode. This effect would be more pronounced in small electrode than in larger ones\nwhich leads to flat displacement profiles in small top electrodes as described before.\nFEM also shows that the size of the electrode when the d33,f reaches its lowest value and at\nwhat size it reaches the constrained piezoelectric coefficient c fd ,33 , depends on not only the\nproperties of the piezoelectric materials, but also on the parameters of the substrate such as its\nthickness and elastic coefficients. This is an addition to the work reported by Wang et al 5\nwhere the substrate thickness was fixed. Figure 10 shows the FEM calculated d33,f as\nfunctions of electrode radius for different thickness of the Si substrate. The material\nparameters used for the model conform to those of Wang et al 5, and as can be seen from the\n500 \uf06dm trace in figure 10, our model has the same response as the 5 \uf06dm trace (figure 4(a)\nfrom ref. 5). Thicker Si substrates led to larger substrate deformation, therefore generally\nsmaller d33,f values, and requires larger electrode sizes to reach the constrained piezoelectric\ncoefficients c fd ,33 . These results indicate that there should be some caution in determining the\npiezoelectric coefficient d33 from the measurement of its thin film on substrate property d33,f,\nsince the measured value depends on not only the intrinsic material properties such as the\n17\nelastic and electric coefficients of the piezoelectric materials and the substrate, but also on\ngeometrical parameters such as the dimensions of the electrode and also the substrate.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have presented a theoretical analysis, to show that bonding of thin film piezoelectric\nsamples to a substantial holder can help in d33,f measurements by subjugating substrate\nbending. This theoretical result has been validated with experimental measurements\ncomparing thin film piezoelectric devices actuated before and after glue bonding. Where the\nbefore results showing substrate bending had a displacement peak an order of magnitude\ngreater than the thickness dilatation. After bonding, the specimen showed little substrate\nbending, and a clamped displacement was found not higher than the noise floor of the\nmeasurement system (approximately 1pm).\nBy using vibrometry for the d33,,f measurements it was possible to do detailed scans of the\nactuated thin film samples, this highlighted a displacement profile whereby the edges of the\nelectrode had anti-phase peaks. Due to the non-continuity of electric field at the edge of the\ntop electrode, there is a significant concentration of shear stress and electric field in the\nvicinity of the electrode edge, which lead to a marked increase of strain toward the edge of the\ntop electrode. In association with this strain peaking at the inside edge, there is a strain in\nopposite direction just outside the electrode. Both FEM modelling and LSV measurements\nconfirmed these results. FEM results also revealed that Poisson\u2019s ratio and the d31 of the\npiezoelectric thin film affect the heights of these peaks. Higher Poisson\u2019s ratio and larger d31\nleads to larger strain increase at the electrode edge.\nThe measured d33,f was found to depend on the size of the top electrode and it is not a\nmonotonic relationship. At very small top electrode sizes (< 1\uf06dm), d33,f is close to d33, but\ndecreases with the increasing size of the top electrode, d33,,f then reaches a minimum, before\n18\nbeginning to increase again with the increasing size of the top electrode, until it reaches the\nconstrained piezoelectric coefficient c fd ,33 , when the top electrode is beyond a certain size.\nHowever, this relationship depends not only on the material properties such as the\nelectromechanical coefficients of the piezoelectric thin film and the elastic coefficients of the\nthin film and the substrate, but also upon the geometrical factors such as the thickness of the\npiezoelectric film, the dimensions of the electrode, and also the thickness of the substrate.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: The authors acknowledge the financial support of UK EPSRC\n(EP\/D506638\/1) and European network of excellence project MIND (NOE 515757-2).
