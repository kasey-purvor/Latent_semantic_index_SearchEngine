Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n4\n1 Introduction\nThe intake manifold to an internal combustion (I.C.) engine will consist of a network of\ninterconnecting pipes. The lengths of these pipes, and to a certain extent their diameters,\nmust be chosen carefully as they will determine the resonant frequencies of the manifold.\nWhen the engine is run at a speed where one or more of these resonances is excited, then both\nthe volumetric efficiency and the intake noise level may be affected.\nThis paper reports on part of an ongoing study of the acoustics of the intake manifold. To\ndate, wave dynamics have been measured [1] and linear acoustic models have been\ndeveloped to calculate this [2, 3] but only for single cylinder engines. This paper presents a\nlinear acoustic model of a multi-cylinder intake manifold that can be used as part of a hybrid\ntime\/frequency domain method [4] to calculate the intake wave dynamics or practical\nnaturally aspirated engines.\nThe method allows the user to construct a model of almost any manifold of complex\ngeometry. The model is constructed as an assemblage of sub-models:\n(i) A model for a straight pipe with both ends open and through-flow.\n(ii) A model for an expansion chamber consisting of three lengths of pipe laid end-to-end:\na narrow bore pipe expanding into a wide bore pipe contracting into a narrower bore\npipe once more.\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n5\n(iii) A model of a side-branch, which includes a model for a straight pipe with one end\nclosed and a model for the three way junction that joins the side-branch to a length of\nflow pipe.\n(iv) A model for an expansion with two (or more) side-branches, which combines the sub-\nmodels (i, ii, iii) into a multi-way (n-way) junction model.\n(v) A model for an intake throttle.\nA similar modular approach has been adopted elsewhere for the construction of manifold\nmodels based on one-dimensional non-linear gas-dynamic theory. Benson et al [5] developed\nmodels for two types of three-way junction: the first where flow from one delivery pipe\ndiverged into two collector pipes and the second where the flow from two delivery pipes\nconverged into one collector pipe. In the latter case the pressure forces acting on the walls of\nthe junction are known approximately and an appropriate momentum equation can be written\nand solved along with the conservation of mass and energy equations.\nHowever, for the divergent flow case, these pressure forces are not known. Benson et al\novercame this problem by measuring the pressure loss across such junctions during steady\nflow experiments and introducing empirical steady flow loss coefficients to their models.\nThese empirical boundary conditions have been commonly used in I.C. engine simulation\ncodes [6] being improved and extended in more recent times [7, 8].\nThe use of such empirical boundary conditions requires access to appropriate data for the\nflow loss coefficients. When this is not available a simplified constant pressure model must\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n6\nbe used [5]. This assumes that the pressure loss may be neglected and the flow may be\nassumed to be homentropic.\nIn the new manifold model presented in this paper, the effects of pressure loss in n-way pipe\njunctions are included. However, the linear acoustic model employed works on fluctuating\ncomponents of pressure, density and particle velocity only. As a result, careful manipulation\nof the set of governing equations cancels the pressure loss term. This allows the solution of\nthe acoustics of the manifold to be performed without the need for empirical loss coefficients.\nSimple empirical loss coefficients are subsequently used in the method but only to calculate\nthe static pressure loss in the manifold. Therefore, if the user is only interested in the\ncalculation of intake noise and not engine performance, the empirical loss coefficients are not\nneeded.\nIn the present method steady state loss coefficients are not used in the calculation of any\ndynamic quantities whereas in the alternative gas dynamic methods [5, 6, 7, 8] they are. This\ncan never be fully realistic particular at higher frequencies. Therefore, the present method\nrepresents an advance in modelling intake wave dynamics, particularly at higher frequencies.\nIt is based on linear acoustic theory and remains applicable as long as dynamic pressure\namplitudes remain sufficiently low. Investigations on the most extreme case, the Formula 1\nracing engine [3], with dynamic pressures in the range of 0.8 bar, suggests that linear acoustic\ntheory can be applied the intake of any naturally aspirated engine with some confidence.\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n7\n2 Bench test cases for the linear plane wave acoustic sub-models\nThe linear acoustic sub-models listed in the introduction were developed and tested against\nexperiment [9,10]. A number of full size physical models were constructed using thick\nwalled plastic pipe. These were tested using a particular form of wave-decomposition [1]\nusing the experimental set-up shown in Figure 1. The tests were conducted without flow and\nusing white noise excitation provided by a loudspeaker. The decision to test without flow\nwas made in order to obtain the best possible signal-to-noise ratio for the wave\ndecomposition without resorting to a more complex form of signal processing [11].\n3 Overview of the linear plane wave acoustic models\nFive sub-models have been used. The first four of these are not new, being based on well-\nknown models first reported around 1970 [12, 13]. However, they have never been tested\ntogether as an assembled model of a full intake manifold in the way that they have here. In\naddition, the influence of pressure loss on the construction of manifold models of this type\nhas not been discussed before. Pressure loss is not an issue for the first model, (a straight\nopen-open pipe), but it must be considered carefully in the four models that follow it and in\nthe final assembled model of the full intake manifold.\nThe fifth sub-model, that for the intake throttle valve, is new.\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n8\n3.1 Open-open straight pipe model\nThe particular straight pipe model employed here for the inflow boundary to an IC engine\nintake system has been used elsewhere [2, 3, 4].\nThe fundamental acoustic variables employed are fluctuating pressure p, fluctuating particle\nvelocity u and fluctuating density \u03c1. These are related to the total pressure, velocity and\ndensity as follows:\npp'p 0 \uf02b\uf03d (1)\nuu'u 0 \uf02b\uf03d (2)\n\u03c1\u03c1'\u03c1 0 \uf02b\uf03d (3)\nwhere the subscript zero denotes stagnation conditions and the prime superscript denotes a\ntotal quantity.\nThe following useful relationships apply:\n\uf02d\uf02b \uf02b\uf03d ppp (4)\n\uf02d\uf02b \uf02d\uf03d ppuc\u03c1 00 (5)\n2\n0c\npp\u03c1\n\uf02d\uf02b \uf02b\uf03d (6)\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n9\nThe reference point of the model is a frequency varying acoustic reflection coefficient r [14]\nat the inflow end of the pipe (plane x=0) which varies with inflow mean Mach number [15].\nAppropriate end corrections apply and these also vary with Mach number [15].\nro gives the ratio of the amplitude of positive and negative travelling wave components po+\nand po- at plane x = 0 thus:\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\no\no\no\np\np\nr (7)\nAn end correction of length l accounts for the phasing of po+ and po-:\nr = Rei\u03b8 = - Rei2kl where k is the wavenumber (8)\nThe wave components at any other plane (x) in the pipe can be found using the following\ntransformations:\n\uf028 \uf029lxi\nox epp\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b \uf03d \u03b2 (9)\n\uf028 \uf029lxi\nox epp\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d \uf03d \u03b2 (10)\nwhere \u03b2 is a complex wavenumber taking Mach number and visco-thermal attenuation effects\ninto consideration [16]\n\u03b2 = k + \u03b1 (1 \u2013 i) (11)\nand \u03b1 is a visco-thermal attenuation coefficient [16].\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n10\n3.2 Expansion chamber model\nThe expansion chamber model used here has been derived elsewhere [13] with a detailed\ndiscussion of the physics of the problem given in [16]. The discussion here will concentrate\non the effects of flow.\nThe expansion chamber is a common form of duct silencer and it consists of a sudden area\nexpansion followed by a sudden area contraction as shown in Figure 2. The mass, momentum\nand energy conservation equations must be satisfied within a control volume that surrounds\neither geometrical discontinuity and these equations must be satisfied for both mean flow and\nacoustic fluctuations. In addition, the relevant boundary conditions must be satisfied. Figure 2\nshows the two control volumes required to develop the expansion chamber model along with\nan indication of the expected flow shapes adapted from [16].\nThe sudden area contraction will be considered first as it is the simplest case. Measurements\nof the acoustic wavefront and of the flow velocity profile either side of the contraction show\nthat both settle down very quickly after the contraction and resume their characteristic\nuniform shapes [13,16]. This suggests few physical irreversibilities in the contracting flow\nand, thus, the process may be assumed to be an isentropic process. Currie [17] shows rather\nneatly that for an adiabatic flow of an inviscid fluid where there are no body forces (i.e.\nadiabatic irreversible and isentropic flow) the stagnation enthalpy is constant along each\nstreamline. That assumption is used to derive the non-conservative momentum equation\ndown a streamline in isentropic flow:\n222\no u2\n1\u03b3\ncc\n\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d (12)\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n11\nwhere c is the sound speed, u is the velocity and \u03b3 is the ratio of specific heat capacities. \nEquation (12) is used in the formulation of many homentropic boundaries for gas-dynamic\nmodels of pipe inflow [4,6,7]. A fairly simple adiabatic boundary can be written in terms of\nRiemann variables [4] for the sudden area contraction without the need for empirical pressure\nloss coefficients.\nThe linear acoustic model of the sudden contraction is based on the simultaneous solution of\nthe energy equation and the mass conservation equation, the momentum equation not being\nrequired as there are no losses.\nAs stagnation enthalpy per unit mass is conserved, the change in stagnation enthalpy can be\nwritten as:\ndho = 0 (13)\nand differentiating (13)\ndh + u.du = 0 (14)\nRemembering that:\n\u03c1\ndp\ndhTds \uf02d\uf03d (15)\nwhere s denotes specific entropy, p denotes pressure and \u03c1 denotes density, on substitution:\nM.F.

For most practical intake manifolds, an expansion is soon\nfollowed downstream by some other significant change in pipe cross sectional area, and it is\nunlikely that the jet will be fully expanded from the expansion before the flow changes shape\nonce more. In such cases, it is sensible to declare a short control volume around the\nexpansion and set MJ equal to MI.

The models are different\nin some aspects of detail but they both treat the throttle as an adiabatic device where\nstagnation enthalpy is conserved but where there is also a pressure drop. Boundary\nconditions are imposed using Riemann variants where outgoing characteristic variables are\ninfluenced by the inclusion of empirical steady flow loss coefficients in the formulation of the\nboundary.\nAs the outgoing characteristic variables are affected, the value of loss coefficient employed\naffects the calculated wave action upstream and downstream of the throttle. Therefore, the\nBenson and Blair boundaries cause the throttle to produce both static pressure loss and altered\nwave action as is sometimes seen in practice with more highly tuned engines.\nHowever, there is an apparent problem with such boundaries. Winterbone and Pearson [7]\ndiscuss the interaction between a simple wave and a device with an adiabatic pressure loss.\nThe characteristics of the boundary model are such that the reflected wave amplitude p+ is\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n24\ngreater than the incident wave amplitude p- and the transmitted wave amplitude is smaller\nthan the incident wave amplitude. For steady flows this means a build up of pressure\nupstream of the device as would be expected. However, for oscillating flows or for steady\nflows with a superimposed sound field the boundary specifies a reflection coefficient that is\ngreater than unity. This is not a realistic situation except at frequencies near to zero where\nmean flow momentum is converted to static pressure rise as the flow is arrested by the\nthrottle. Therefore, although these boundaries do affect wave action, it is unlikely that this\ncalculated effect will be realistic when the energy of the flow is stored at frequencies much\nabove 0Hz.\nThe linear acoustic model for the throttle presented here does not suffer from this apparent\nproblem. This is because the mean flow effects on static pressure distribution are calculated\nseparately from the effects on wave dynamics. The static pressure losses are calculated using\nempirical loss coefficients [6].\nThe throttle model treats the partially open throttle as a finite length restriction in pipe area.\nThis finite restriction model is an assemblage of sub models:\n(i) In flow to a straight walled pipe of length L2 (referring to Figure: 5)\n(ii) Sudden contraction\n(iii) Straight pipe of length L3, both ends open\n(iv) Sudden expansion\n(v) Straight pipe of length L1, with both ends open\nM.F.

Each test will be discussed in turn.\n4.1 Testing the straight pipe model\nThe test case is shown in Figure 6. A loudspeaker was used to excite a 980mm long pipe\nwith white noise. A two microphone wave decomposition technique [1] was used to measure\nthe specific acoustic impedance ratio at plane \u2018i\u2019, in the duct. The two microphones used\nwere Larson Davis type 2559 with Larson Davis type PRM200C pre-amplifiers and a Larson\nDavis microphone power supply type 2200C. The signals were recorded on a MDP500 dual\nchannel minidisc recorder (a discussion of the consequences of this is given in [1]), digitised\nusing an Iotech Daqbook 200 system and stored on a PC. All signal processing was\nperformed using Matlab code written for the purpose [1].\nFigure 7 shows the results from the straight pipe model with zero flow against experiment.\nThe agreement between measured and calculated resonant frequencies (high \u03b6) is near perfect\nbut the impedance levels at resonance vary. The extent of the variation is perhaps\nemphasised by the use of a linear impedance scale. The overall agreement is good.\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n26\n4.2 Testing the expansion chamber model\nThe test case is shown in Figure 8. A comparison between measured and calculated results is\nshown in Figure 9. The agreement is generally very good.\n4.3 Testing the 3-way junction model\nThe test case is shown in Figure 10. A comparison between measured and calculated results\nis shown in Figure 11. The agreement in resonant frequencies is good although the\nagreement in impedance level at resonance is restricted at low frequencies.\nThe impedance level is determined in part by the value of reflection coefficient modulus |rp|\nemployed to describe the closed end of the passive pipe. Figures 12, 13, 14 show the effect\nof reducing this from unity, through a value of 0.99 to a value to 0.95. A modified version of\nthe wave decomposition technique [1] with four microphones has been used to measure the\nattenuation (dB) afforded by the passive pipe.\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\nI\no\np\np\ndBATT (61)\nReducing |rp| reduces the amplitude of the attenuation at anti-resonance to be nearer the value\nfound by experiment but it has the side-effect of deepening the dip in attenuation caused at a\nslightly lower frequency. A value for |rp| of 0.99 seems a reasonable compromise and this\nvalue has been used throughout the work reported here.\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n27\n4.4 Testing the n-way junction model\nThe test case is shown in Figure 15. A comparison between measured and calculated results\nis shown in Figure 16. The agreement is fairly good. The full model has been constructed by\nbringing models for the straight outlet pipe, the contraction, the passive 3-way junction and\nthe expansion together.\n4.5 Testing the intake throttle model\nThe test case is shown in Figure: 17. The reflection coefficient 700 mm downstream of the\nthrottle was measured with the throttle removed, with it wide open, with it fully closed, and at\nseveral settings with it partially open. Figures: 18, 19, 20 show the measured impedance ratio\nfor the fully open, fully closed and 5 degrees open cases respectively. The suppression in\nstanding wave ratio is seen as a lower peak in impedance at resonance, around 9.5 \u03c1oco with 5\ndegrees opening, compared with 15 \u03c1oco for wide open throttle and >20 \u03c1oco for the fully\nclosed throttle.\nFigure:21 shows the impedance spectra measured at several throttle positions. With the\nthrottle more than 5\uf0b0 open, the resonant and anti resonant frequencies are hardly affected by a\nchange in throttle angle.\nThe throttle geometry is shown in Figure: 22.

It is clear that the resonant frequencies match best when the acoustic length is\nset to 5.5 mm which is 32% of the averaged physical length LE shown in Table: 1. Figures:\n26, 27, 28 show matches for resonant frequencies for 30\uf0b0, 15\uf0b0, 5\uf0b0 openings respectively and\nin each case the acoustic length used was 25%, 21% and 33% of the averaged physical length\nrespectively.\nSo, the finite length restriction model predicts resonant frequencies correctly providing that\nthe acoustic length of the restriction is some 20-30% on average of the physical equivalent\nlength calculated using (63). The model does not however predict the suppression of standing\nwave ratio with closing throttle that was found in the experiments.\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n29\n5 Case study on a running four-cylinder engine\nThe five linear plane wave acoustic sub-models described in Section 3 have been tested on a\nbench as reported in Section 4. Such tests provide the best possible conditions for the wave-\ndecomposition measurements and thus there is good confidence in the measured results for\nspecific acoustic impedance ratio. Such confidence is necessary when de-bugging the\ncomputer code used to generate the modelling results.\nNotwithstanding this, it remains necessary to determine how useful the acoustic models prove\nto be when applied to a real test case.\nWave decomposition measurements have been made on the intake system of a 1.0 litre, four-\ncylinder, four-stroke gasoline engine that is currently fitted to a small mass-produced car. The\nengine was run on a dynamometer in a large open-plan laboratory as shown in Figure: 29,\nwith the exhaust gases piped away to the outside of the building.\nAn experimental end feed intake manifold was manufactured for the tests (Figure: 30). The\nmanifold assembly consisted of four parts; an intake pipe, a throttle body, a plenum with four\npipes (known as \u2018runners\u2019) leading to the intake ports, and a holder for the four fuel injectors\nfitted to the engine. The manifold dimensions were representative of a typical end-feed\nsystem designed to boost lower speed torque and are shown in Figure: 31.\nEach runner was drilled and tapped in three locations, two opposite each other at a distance of\n100mm from the junction with the plenum and one at 250mm from that junction (see Figure:\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n30\n31). Two Kistler type 4045A2 (2 bar) piezo-resistive pressure transducers were used to\nmeasure of both static and dynamic pressures at these tappings. Their signals were amplified\nusing two Kistler type 4611 amplifiers and the resulting fluctuating voltages were digitised\nusing a 16-bit National Instruments acquisition system and stored on a PC. The digitised\nsignals were post processed off-line using codes written in Matlab\u2122.\nMany engine tests were performed. The speed-control mode of the dynamometer was used to\nset the engine to speeds in the range 1200-3200 revmin-1 in steps of 200 revmin-1. Long\nsequences of intake pressure data (25 seconds, acquired at 8192 Hz) were acquired\nsimultaneously in each case. For the first tests, pressures were measured at the two tappings\nthat are opposite to one another in runner 1 and the results used for the calibration part of the\nwave-decomposition technique [1]. Other tests were made with the two transducers 150mm\napart. These later tests were repeated for each of the four runners. The engine was operated\nfirst with a wide-open throttle and then with the throttle partially closed (15% open, as\nmeasured using the throttle position sensor on the engine). A total of 176 tests were\nperformed along with 22 calibrations.\nFigure: 32 shows the torque output of the engine as measured by the dynamometer with the\nengine running first with a wide-open throttle and then with a throttle that is 15% open. A\npeak in the wide-open throttle toque curve is clearly seen at 2000 revmin-1. The shape of the\npart load torque curve is due to the ignition maps used with the engine. At the lowest speeds,\nthe ignition timing is 10 degrees before top dead centre for both wide-open and part throttles.\nAt higher speeds, the ignition is advanced for the wide-open throttle case but retarded for the\npart throttle case. The retarding of the part-throttle ignition timing is a deliberate strategy to\npromote rapid deceleration of the engine when the throttle is suddenly released at high engine\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n31\nspeeds. It is accompanied by an increase in fuel-air ratio to preserve the life of the catalytic\nconverter.\nFigure: 33 shows the fluctuating component of pressure measured in each of the four runners\nwith the engine at the peak torque condition (2000 revmin-1, wide-open throttle). The\npressure signals are near sinusoidal, with high amplitude and little variation between those\nmeasured in different runners. This pattern is in marked contrast to that found in single\ncylinder engines [1, 3] where the intake pressure signal consists of a pressure depression as\nthe intake valve opens, followed by a pressure peak as the valve closes, followed by a\ndecaying oscillation before the valve starts to open once more. The pattern in Figure: 33 is\neasily explained. The pressure peaks recorded in runner 1 occur every 0.25 of a four-stroke\ncycle. Each one originates from a different intake stroke (there being four per cycle in this\nfour-cylinder engine) and will be caused by the period when the respective intake valve is\nopen. At this particular operating condition, when the intake pressure is at a maximum in\nrunner 1 it is also near to a maximum in the other runners. The mode of behaviour for the\nwave action is therefore clearly well organised (i.e. resonant) as the pressure waves in each\nrunner are synchronous with each other. The fluid motion can be visualised as a synchronous\nsloshing up and down the four runners. Resonant behaviour in the intake system would be\nexpected at this operating condition as the torque is at a maximum [3]. The average distance\nbetween the intake ports of the four cylinders is 660mm (taken along the centreline of the\nrunners and plenum), which at a sound speed of 343 ms-1 would be covered in 1.9 ms or\n0.032 of the time taken to complete one four-stroke cycle at 2000 revmin-1. This phase delay\nof 0.032 cycles is small compared with the interval between pressure peaks which is 0.25\ncycles and so the time interval between peaks is (almost) uniform.\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n32\nFigure: 34 shows the fluctuating component of pressure measured in each of the four runners\nwith the engine at a low torque condition (1400 revmin-1, wide-open throttle). This time the\npressure amplitude is much smaller than for the peak torque condition (1\/3 of the amplitude)\nalthough the torque has only dropped by 20%. The wave action in the intake manifold is not\nwell organised as the pressure peaks in runner 1 do not occur at the same time as those in the\nother runners. The pressure peaks in the other runners are in phase with each other however,\nsuggesting resonant behaviour in only part of the manifold at this operating condition.\nFigure: 35 shows the fluctuating component of pressure measured in each of the four runners\nwith the engine at an intermediate torque condition (2400 revmin-1, wide-open throttle). This\ntime the pressure amplitude lies between the amplitudes noted for the high and low torque\noperating conditions (Figures: 33, 34 respectively) and the wave action is not well organised\nin any part of the manifold.\nFigure: 36 shows the fluctuating component of pressure measured in each of the four runners\nwith the engine at a 2000 revmin-1, 15% open throttle. The influence of part throttle operation\non the intake pressures is clearly seen when Figure: 36 is compared with Figure: 33. The part\nthrottle attenuates the pressure amplitude, distorts the waveform, disrupts the well-organised\nwave motion in the manifold and introduces higher frequency noise to the waveform. These\neffects are also seen in the respective spectra for the two pressure signals (Figures: 37, 38).\nThe spectra are the average of more than one hundred 2048 point FFTs in each case,\nproducing a spectral resolution of 4 Hz. The tonal quality of the pressure signal for the wide-\nopen throttle case is clearly seen in Figure: 37.\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n33\nFigure: 39 shows the coherence obtained between two pressure signals recorded 150mm apart\nin runner 1 of the engine, 2400 revmin-1, wide-open throttle. The coherence is good only at\nlow frequencies where the sound pressure level has a tonal peak. Figure: 40 shows the\ncorresponding result at 2400 revmin-1, 15% open throttle. The higher frequency coherence is\nimproved due to the more evenly distributed spectral shape found with the part-throttle\nresults when compared with the wide-open throttle results (Figure: 38 compared with 37).\nOverall, the coherence between pressure signals measured in the same intake runner is poor\ncompared to what has been achieved before on a running single-cylinder engine [1].\nTherefore, a particular adaptation of the regular wave-decomposition technique was\nemployed here to mitigate against this problem. The wave-decomposition calculation was\nperformed in the usual way [1] but the results were then post-processed. The results at any\nfrequency were discarded unless the coherence between the two pressure signals was greater\nthan 0.99. As a result, for every engine speed and load condition, wave decomposition results\nwere only obtained at between 5 and 20 of the 1024 spectral lines available. However, when\nthe results from all the speeds are combined, a rather sparse composite picture of the specific\nacoustic impedance ratio is obtained, where the few results that are shown are deemed to be\nreliable. This composite picture is rather unusual because the results have been obtained with\na wide range of volume flow rates through each runner. The volumetric efficiency of the\nengine was known and hence the volumetric flow rates could be found for each speed and the\ncorrect time-averaged flow rate was used for each wave-decomposition experiment.\nFigure: 41 shows the composite results obtained for the speed range 1200-3200 revmin-1 with\na wide-open throttle and Figure: 42 shows the corresponding results for a throttle that is only\n15% open. The results obtained from a linear acoustic model of the full intake system\n(including the throttle) assembled using the 5 sub-models described in Section 3 are also\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n34\nshown. In each case, a single speed-averaged volumetric flow rate has been used in the\nmodelling, assuming that the flow is evenly distributed across all four runners. The modelling\nis undertaken separately for each runner and it is assumed that only the runner being\nmodelled has flow and that the valves that terminate the other runners remain shut. However,\nthe measurements are made over many complete cycles and therefore wave action is recorded\nin runners that have valves that open and close (and hence provide time-varying flow rates).\nTherefore, the modelling is a simplification of the true behaviour with respect to the flow in\nthe manifold and to the time-varying termination impedance of each runner (high when the\nvalve is closed, lower when it is open).\nA number of observations can be made regarding the measured data shown in Figures: 41,\n42.\nFirstly, the measured spectral shape of the specific acoustic impedance ratio shown in Figure:\n41 is different in each runner, although the results for runners 2 and 3 are quite similar. All\nfour show a peak at the same low frequency. This feature is responsible for the resonant\nbehaviour noted at 2000 revmin-1 in Figure: 33.\nSecondly, by comparing Figures: 41 and 42, it can be seen that the spectral shape of the\nmeasured specific acoustic impedance ratio changed significantly with throttle angle. Note\nthe loss of the low frequency peak when the throttle valve is partially closed, echoing the\ndisruption to resonant behaviour noted in Figure: 36\nThirdly, the magnitude of the measured specific acoustic impedance ratio is quite low (mostly\nbelow 10\n00c\u03c1 ) and therefore resonant wave action in the manifold will be weaker than\nM.F. Harrison, I. De Soto, P.L. Rubio Unzueta INTAKE MANIFOLD AND THROTTLE, Revision 2\n35\nmight otherwise be expected from the calculated results. The width of the peaks in the\nmeasured specific acoustic impedance ratio suggests the presence of some effective\nmechanism of wave-damping. This might be due to either flow separation or the effects of\npulsile flow or flow induced noise.\nFinally, the acoustic characteristics of runner 4 as shown in Figure: 42 are unusual as a strong\npeak in the measured results is shown at 250 Hz. This is not seen in the results for runners 2,3\nand seen only weakly in the results for runner 1. Runner 4 is very near the throttle body so it\nexperiences a different flow field to the other three runners and this may explain the unusual\nbehaviour.\nThe results from the modelling are encouraging. Notwithstanding the difficulties in obtaining\nreliable measured results, the results that are shown do correspond quite closely to the results\nfrom the model at the lower frequencies. The modelling produces very different results for\neach runner and for different throttle settings, justifying the level of detail adopted. Given the\nunsteady nature of the flow in such a manifold, the relative simplicity of the modelling and\nthe possibilities for flow induced noise, the validation is thought to be good.\nM.F.
