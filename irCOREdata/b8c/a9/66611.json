More specifically, it\nwill compare and contra t the approaches to botany adopted by\nRou. seau and Goethe. The perspective to be adopted is thus probably\nbest qualified as ccocritical according to the broadest definition of\nccocriticism as a form of literary enquiry that 'encompasses nonhuman\nas well as human contexts and considerations'.' The focu here will be\non what Jonathan Bate calls the central question confronting literary\necocriticism, namely 'the place of creative imagining and writing in the\ncomplex set of relationship between humankind and environment,\nbet\\-veen mind and world'.2 Plants havc been chosen not only becau. e\nof their centrality in the work of Rousseau and Goethe, both of whom\npursued scientific pur uits alongside their literary career, but also\nbecause they combine, arguably more than most other natural pheno-\nmena, a marked appeal to the senses with a considerable amount of\naccrucd cultural significance. As Georges Bataille has pointed out, the\nflower as such is in danger of disappearing when it is used to stand for\nhuman emotions or characteristics: instead of ' eeing' a rose, for\nexample, one would now tend to see 'love'.J Indeed, in his Fragments\npour Ul1 dicliol1naire des lames d'usage el1 botanique, Rousseau discusses -\nand also unwittingly illustrates - the difficulty of distinguishing ben-veen\nthe 'literary' flower, the flower of rhetoric, and the 'natural' flower, the\nobject of scientific inve tigation. 4 This difficulty of separating cultural\nhistory from what is still often called 'natural hi tory' would thus seem\nto repre. ent a particular challenge to the writer-botanist and a potential\nob tacle to the authentic imagining of plants aspired to by Rous eau\nand Goethe.\nIt should be pointed out at the beginning that this article is not\nconcerned with specific questions of influence (although Rousseau's\n2 I I\n212 JA E WALLl G\nbotanical writing did ha e a con iderable impact on Goethe5). Rather,\nan attempt will be made to examine t~e contra ting - and po sibly\nconflicting - paradigm that emerge from their imaginati e engage-\nment with botany. One central que tion that will be addre d here\nconcern the relative compatibilit of the scientific and the arti tic\/\nimaginative approache to nature adopted by Rou seau and Goethe.\nfurther, related, con ideration will be to a k whether their different\nre ponses can be characteri ed a more anthropocentric in privileging\nhuman vision (with flowers being seen through what i e entially\nsome kind of human lens, be it utilitarian, ae thetic or cultural) or what\ni. now termed ecocentric, with flower being looked at, a it were, for\ntheir own sake, on their own terms. 6 To what extent, in other word, i\nit the real flower that i being seen and de cribed in their writing? If it\nis true, as Lawrence Buell claim in hi highly influential The Enviro1!-\nmental Imagination, that writing about nature entail an aesthetic of\n'dual accountabilitv\" both to the out ide world and to the inner one, or\nwhat he calls a 'ymbiosi of object-re pon ivene and imaginative\nhaping',7 how do the e two writer acquit them elve ? To what e tent\ndo they succeed in re pecting and pre erving the living otherne of\nnature and a oid immobili ing, objectifying, anthropomorphi ing it?\nDo they invite the reader just to interact with a literary text or doe\ntheir writing al 0 encourage him\/her to enter into a more con ciou\ninteraction with nature? Buell al 0 uccinctly put it: 'Must\nliterature alway lead u away from the phy ical world, never back to\n. )' ( )It. p. I I .\nIt would obviously go beyond the cope of this article to context-\nuali e in detail Jean-Jacque Rous eau' interest in plants both within\nhis own career and within the botany of hi. time. Suffice it then to ay\nthat his knowledge of and passion for botany were long- tanding and\nhave received a certain amount of critical attention. He r cord the\ndelight he took in plant a early a 1738 and this continued with\nvarying degree of intensity until hi death forty years later. con tant\nfeature that emerge from all his variou writings on botan i hi\nvehement condemnation of what he refer to a 'ce degoutant prejuge'\n(this dista teful prejudice),9 namely the tendency to value plant purely\nin terms of their potential medicinal usefulne s, which i how they were\nseen by mo t contemporary botani ts. Indeed, his Let\/res elhnentaires\nsur fa botanique of 1771-3 are intended to be purely informative and\npedagogical, written for a young mother who wishes to in truct her\nfour year-old daughter in understanding and identifying flowering\nBotany in Rousseau and Goethe 213\nplants. A uch, they could be \u00b7aid to repre ent a homage to the\nSwedi h naturalist Carl von Linne who, according to Rou seau in the\nReveries, partly succeeded in rescuing plants from the pharmacy and\ntransferring them to the realm of natural history (p. 127; p. 110).\nRou seau's argument against the medicinal exploitation of plants is,\nfir. tly, that a utilitarian per pective considerabl restrict the number\nof plant likely to be studied and, secondly, that it focu es attention\nonly on specific, suppo edly healing, propertie . It thu ignores 'la\nstructure vcgetale' and 'I'organisation de plantes' (Le Botaniste sans\nMaitre, p. 14) or 'what plants are by paying attention to what they can\ndo'.IO Rousseau's avowed aim of concentrating on 'what plants are'\nwould eem to uggest a more ecocentric perspective, one that focuses\nin a disinterested way on the uniqueness and pecificity of the\nindividual plant. This impre ion is confirmed in the eventh of the\nLettres dementaires where he ob erve that botany is 'une etude de pure\ncurio ite, et qui n'a d'autre utilite reelle que celle que peut tirer un etre\npensant et sen ible de l'observation de la nature et des merveilles de\nI'univers' (Le Botaniste sans Maitre, p. 80; a study of pure curio ity\nwhich has no real u efulnes other than that which a thinking, sensitive\nbeing can derive from the observation of nature and the wonders of the\nuniver e). Indeed, it is preci ely it usele ne s that recommend\nbotany to Rous cau since, for him, utilitarian concern prevent human\nbeing from approaching nature with an open mind and lead them\nrather to try to impo e their will on it in a way that can be ultimately\nde tructive. In explicitly rejecting this anthropocentric per pective\nRousseau considers himself to be different from - and possibly superior\nto - the rest of humanity: ICe tournures d'esprit qui rapportent toujour\ntout a notre interet materiel ... n'ont jamais ete les miennes. ]e me sen\nla-de u tout a rebour des autre homme' (p. 128; This attitude\nwhich alway bring everything back to our material intere t ... ha\nnever been an attitude of mine. In this I am diametrically oppo ed to\nother men, p. III).\nIn these Lettres elementaires Rou seau recommends studying plants\n'as a way of learning both how to see clearly, without preconceptions\nor assumption, and how to classify, sy tematize and understand the\nmiracles of nature in a pirit of humility' (Dent, p. 42). The ability to\nob erve plant closely and systematically i in fact, a he ays in the\nfir t letter, more important than knowing their name. It i this emphasi\non the detailed and unprejudiced ob ervation of the phenomenon, what\nRousseau in the Reveries call a 'contemplation pure et desinteressee'\nJA E WALLI G\n(p. 129; pure and di interested contemplation, p. I I I), in other words,\nan attempt at seeing the real flower and not the literary or symbolic\nflower, that will later be adopted and adapted by Goethe. Typical of\nGoethe too, as we hall see, are the 'spirit of humility' and the desire to\n'under tand the miracles of nature'.\n\\ hen one look more closely, however, it become apparent that,\nalthough Rou seau explicitly rejects a utilitarian per pective on nature,\non another level the plea ure he take in the study of plant i far from\npure and di intere ted. On the contrary, he makes numerou\nreferences in his autobiographical writings to it therapeutic function.\nIn Les Confessions he says, for example: 'La botanique, telle que je l'ai\ntoujours consideree, et telle qu'elle commenc;ait adevenir pa ion pour\nmoi, etait preci ement une etude oi eu e, propre a remplir tout Ie vide\nde me loisirs ans ylai ser place au delire de l'imagination, ni a l'ennui\nd'un de reuvrement total' (Botany - a I had alway considered it and\na I till did when it began to become a pa ion with me - wa exactly\nthe kind of idle pur uit to fill the void of my leisure, leaving no room\nfor the wildne s of the imagination or for the boredom of total\ninaction). I J It is, in other words, a civilised pa time which calms hi\nsoul and occupies hi mind, preventing him from reflecting on painful\nexperiences. Rousseau ay more specifically of his botanical writing\nin Les Reveries du promeneur solitaire: 'c'e t Ie moyen de ne lai er\ngermer dan mon creur aucun levain de vengeance ou de haine' (p. 124;\nit is a way of preventing any eeds of vengeance or hate from taking\nroot in my heart, p. 106). To be happy de pite his per ecutors, he\nadds, is in fact the best way to take his revenge on them! In other\nwords, not only does he study plants in order to be happy and keep\nhim elf occupied, but hi happiness itself i intended to perform a\nfurther - ery human - function. Botany thus becomes an agreeable\ndi traction from and antidote to hi celebrated misanthropy,l2 and even\n- indirectly - a weapon to be u ed again t hi enemies.\nIt is thu illuminating to consider Rousseau's inconsistency here: the\nobvious anthropocentri m of the medicinal exploitation of plant i\nrejected, whereas the more subtle psychological use made of them not\nonly is acceptable in hi eyes but al 0 seems as important as the increa e\nin knowledge to which tudying them give rise. In Rou seau the\nflower could thu be aid to exist for its observer, for the aesthetic\npleasure, intellectual activity and abo e all serenity it stimulates in\nhim. As Philip Knight points out, although Rous eau claim hi\n'sentimental botany' has no utilitarian purpose, he pre ent it both as a\nBotany in Rousseau and Goethe 21 5\nretreat from 'ociety into rustic nature and as a way of purifying his\nimagination through contact with the innocence of plants. IJ One tele-\nology has thu been replaced by another: for Rous eau plant seem to be\nthere, not for their own. ake, but as object of human contemplation.\nMoreover, in Rousseau's 'passion' for classifying plants one can detect\nevidence of a desire to control and even dominate. It is interesting to\nnote that 'assujettir' (to subject or ubjugate) is the word he uses to\ndescribe the making of a herbarium.1.j In this process flowers are\npicked, dried, di sected and labelled, their living presence tran formed\ninto a dead specimen and completely cut off from the ecosystem to\nwhich they helong. The herbarium then functions as a kind of\nbotanical diary: seeing a dried flower reminds Rous eau of the living\nspecimen and of the particular personal and geographical context in\nwhich he saw it. As Knight ay, the activity of 'herborisation' produces\nthe 'herbier, an anthology not only of plants but of remembered\n(recreatable) feelings, each dried flower a nostalgic emblem of hap pi-\nne s in a rustic setting' (p. 16). Rousseau describes, for example, in the\nseventh Promenade how in old age, no longer able to \\'isit scenes of past\npleasure and no longer able fully to recall them with his failing\nimagination, he needs these 'primitive and highly personalised antho-\nlogies' which allow 'the experience to rush back to him, transcending\ntemporal and spatial boundaries, giving him the exquisite illusion of\nattaining eternity'. 15 As Jean Starobinski put it, 'Ia f1eur de scchee ...\nreveille Ie paysage, la journce ... Elle e t Ie signe qui permet au\nhonheur revolu de rede\\'enir un sentiment immediat' (the dried flower\n... reveals the landscape, the day ... It is the sign which allows past\nhappiness to become once again an immediate feeling).lo In other words,\nRou seau makes use of flowers not only as objects of contemplation but\nalso as stimuli to his memory.\nIndeed, Rou seau lists and categorises individual plants, but it is\ninteresting to note that, in his non-botanical writings, he doe not\nattempt to describe them. In the econd Promenade, for example, he\nmention his pleasure at recognising a number of rare flowers, whose\nLatin name he gives, but then almost immediately moves on to convey\nan impression of the atmo phere of the whole setting: 'je quittai peu a\npeu ces menues observations pour me livrer a I'impression non mains\nagreable mais plus touchante que fai ait ur moi l'en emble de tout cela'\n(pp. 46-7; I gradually passed from these detailed ob ervations to the\nequally agreeable but more affecting impressions made on me by the\ncomplete picture, p. 37). In thi particular in tance the impres ion is in\n216 JA E WALLI G\nfact highly anthropomorphic, 'un melange d'impres ion douce et tri te\ntrop analogue a mon age et a mon sort pour que je ne m 'en fi e pas\nl'application' (mixed feelings of gentle adness which were too closely\nakin to my age and my experience for me not to make the comparison).\nA very similar pattern i repeated in the seventh Promenade: 'je trouvai\nla dentaire heptaphyllos, Ie cic\/amen, Ie nidus avis, Ie grand lacerpitium et\nquelques autres plante qui me charmerent et m'amu erent longtemp .\nMai. in ensiblement domine par la forte impre sion des objets, j'oubliai\nla botanique et les plante, je m'a i sur des oreiller de lycopodium et\nde mousses, et je me mis arever plus amon ai c' (p. 135; Here I found\nseven-leaved coral-wort, cyclamen, nidus avis, the large laserpitium and\na few other plants which occupied and delighted me for a long time,\nbut gradually succumbing to the powerful impre ion of my\nsurrounding, I forgot about botany and plants, sat down on pillows of\nlycopodium and mo ses, and began dreaming to my heart' content, pp.\n117-8).\nRousseau's writing about botany i thu characteri ed by a triking\ncontrast between, on the one hand, the scientific labelling of plant\nand, on the other, the vaguer, more atmo pheric presentation of a\nwhole ecosystem. In other word, he u e both a very pecific Linnean\nbinominal nomenclature and a more com'entional, generali ed poetic\nlexis. One critic ha commented on the discrepancy in Rou seau between\nthe richne of the e perience of nature and the relative po erty of the\nconceptual and lingui tic material with which he describe it and ha\nsuggested that in his u age of commonplace, arcadian image - the\n'brillantes fleurs, email despres.ombragefrais.ruisseaux. bosquets,\nverdure' of the Reveries (p. 132; bright flower, adornment of the\nmeadow, cool shade, streams, woods and green glade, p. 114) - he is\ntypical of hi period. 17 By contrast with thi , the preci e language of\nbotany allowed Rous eau economicall and unambiguou I to evoke a\nparticular plant. Thi perhap e plain hi predilection for preci e\nLatin terminology which thu function as the verbal equivalent of and\naccompaniment to the dried flowers in hi herbarium, linguistic label\nwhich serve both to identify and to stimulate recollection.\nBefore we leave Rousseau it is worth con idering one final pas age\n(from Book 6 of Les Confessions) which hed an intere ting and ironic\nlight on his empha i on seeing plant. Thi famou extract i worth\nquoting in full:\nEn marchant elle [Madame de Warens] vit quelque cho c de blcu dan la haie, et\nme dit: Voila de la pervenche encore en Oeur.]e n'avais jamai vu de la pervenche,\nBotany in Rousseau and Goethe 21 7\nje nc me baissai pas pour I'examiner, et j'ai la vue trop courte pour distinguer a\nterre les plantes de ma hauteur. Je jetai seulement en passant un coup d'o::il sur\ncelie-la, et pres de trente ans se sont passes sans que j'aie revu de la pervenche ou\nque j'y aie fait attention. En 1764, etant a Cressier avec mon ami M. du Peyrou,\nnous montions une petite montagne au sommet de laquelle il a un joli salon qu'il\nappelle avec rai on Belle-Vue. Je commencyais alors d'herboriser un peu. En\nmontant et regardant parmi Ie' buissons, je pou se un eri de joie: Ah! voila de la\npen1enche! et e'en etait en effet. Du Peyrou s'aperyut du transport, mai il en\nignorait la cause; il I'apprendra, je I'espere, lorsqu'un jour il lira ceei. (p. 223)\nA he walked she. aw something blue in the hedge, and aid to me: 'Look!\nThere are some periwinkle still in nower'. I had never seen a periwinkle, I did not\nstoop to examine it, and I am too short-sighted to distinguish plants on the\nground without doing so. I merely gave it a passing glance, and nearly thirty years\nelapsed before I saw any periwinkle again, or at least before I noticed any. In 1764,\nwhen I wa at ere sier with my friend M. du Peyrou, we were climbing a hill, on\nthe top of which he has built a pretty little look-out which he rightly call nelle\nVue. I was then beginning to botanize a little and, as I climbed and looked among\nthe bu hes, I gave a shout of joy: 'Look, there are some periwinkle!', as in fact\nthey were. Du Peyrou noticed my delight, but he did not know its cause; he will\nlearn it, I hope, when one day he reads thi . (p. 216)\nIn this strange passage nobody actually sees 'de la pervenche'. Madame\nde Warens, passing by, notices 'something blue in the hedge', while\nRousseau himself is at least twice blind: involuntarily ('I had never\nseen a periwinkle' and 'I am too short-sighted') and voluntarily ('I did\nnot stoop to examine it'). But the un cen object of vision does not let\nitself be ignored. Thirty years later a similar scene occurs at a place,\nsignificantly called nelle Vue. Rousseau 'recognises' 'de la pervenche'\nwhich he still has never actually seen before. It seems that what allows\nhim to recognise the flower are the words which come back to him,\nalong with a glimpse of colour: 'the flower speaks first to the ear and\nonly then to the eye' (Sartiliot, pp. 120-22); and it is through a con-\nnection to the past that he can then identify something in the present.\nAlthough Rousseau refuses to 'see', he is not allowed to forget: the\nflower is remembered without having been seen or described. As\nSartiliot puts it, 'Laziness and shortsightedness prevent Rousseau from\n\"seeing\", from consciou Iy allowing into his mind something that\nsomehow gets inscribed there unconsciously' (p. 121). Despite his bad\neye ight '8 and his bad memory,I9 the flower resist his neglect and\nsurvIves.\nOne might conclude from these examples that, despite hi own\nclaim and some initial appearances to the contrary, it is a largely\nanthropocentric paradigm that we find in Rousseau. His work bears\n218 J E WALLI G\nwitness to a great desire to ob ene and under tand botan , but\nultimately plant seem to be valued largely for what they evoke in the\nob erver, namely memorie , the intellectual pleasure of accumulating\nand ystemati ing knowledge, a degree of p ycho-spiritual erenity. In\nthi re pect he could be aid to be typical of the pirit of hi age: on the\none hand, Buffon and Linne are adopting a y tematic approach to the\ntudy of natural phenomena; on the other, there i a new pre-Romantic\ninterest in their sugge tive potential. Rousseau' work articulate thi\ngulf between the cientific study of plant (in his purel botanical\nwritings) and their affective, imaginative appeal (in his autobiograph-\nical texts), but i unable to bridge it. In fact, he him elf illustrates this\nsplit particularly clearly in the distinction he makes between\n'botani tes' and 'bergers' in hi dictionary definition of the word\n'fleur'. This entry begin as follows: lSi je livrai mon imagination aux\ndouces en ations que ce mot emble appeler, je pourrais faire un\narticle agreable peut-etre aux bergers, mai fort mau ais pour les\nbotaniste : ecarton donc un moment les vive couleur, Ie odeur\nsuave, les forme elegante, pour chercher premierement a bien\nconnaitre I'etre organi equi les rassemble' (Le Botaniste sans Maitre, p.\n112; If I were to abandon my imagination to the gentle en ation\nwhich this word seem to evoke, I could write an article which would\nperhap appeal to shepherd but be very bad for botani t : let u\ntherefore for a moment forget the vivid colours, the sweet scent, the\nelegant forms, in order first of all to try to get to know the organi ed\nbeing which unites all of these features). This distinction echoe the\ndifference described by John Ruskin in his Preface to Modern Painters\n'between the mere botanist's knowledge of plants, and the great poet's\nor painter' knowledge of them'. The difference, he says, i that 'the\none notes their distinctions for the sake of swelling hi herbarium, the\nother, that he rna render them ehicle of expres ion and emotion'. 20\nTurning now to Goethe, we shall con ider whether it i in fact\npo sible to be at once a 'mere botanist' and a 'great poet', that i , to\nunite the scientific study of plants with an openne to their imagina-\nti e appeal. Ithough he admired Rou eau and claimed to have learnt\na great deal from him, Goethe him elf adopted a ery different approach\nto botany. Best-known of course a a poet and pIa wright, he al 0,\nhowever, spent many year, between 1777 and hi death in 1832,\nengaged in cientific pur uits, of which one of the mo t important wa\nthe tudy of plant, although he also carried out research in, amongst\nother things, mineralogy, geology, optics and anatomy. A great deal has\nBotany in Rousseau and Goethe 21 9\nbeen written about the philosophical issues surrounding his studies of\nnature but Ie s about the experimental method it elf. However, one\nwriter who has dealt with it provide a u eful definition, ba ed on\nGoethe's own omewhat un y tematic de cription . For Fritz Hein -\nmann this method is 'genuinely phenomenological. It begins with\nphenomena, proceeds through them, and ends with them, returning at\nthe last from the Ur-phenomenon (archetypal phenomenon) to the\nparticular whose claims have not at any point been abrogated'.21\nGoethe's aim in hi phenomenology of nature wa to make y tem-\natic u e of a scientific methodology which would value the qualitative\na much as the quantitative experience of phenomena. 22 By uniting\nempirical ob ervation of nature with a more intuitive, imaginative\nrespon e, this approach would eem to reconcile the scientific and the\nartistic in a way that Rou seau's did not. In order to highlight the\ndifference between Rousseau and Goethe it will be neces ary to look\nat some of the techniques the latter developed in order to bring about\nwhat he termed 'Anschauende Urteil kraft', usually translated as\nintuitive and\/or perceptive judgment, a kind of 'higher' empirici m. 2]\nThe following expo ition is, however, ju t an over iew of some of the\nideas developed by Goethe in two lengthy es ays, 'Morphology' and\n'The Metamorphosis of Plants', as well as in a series of shorter\nwriting . It will not attempt to pre ent in detail the outcome of hi\nbotanical re earch but, for the purpo es of a compari on with Rou cau,\nwill focus on the methodology he u ed.\nGoethe him elf divided his method of approach into three stages:\nseeing the 'empirical phenomenon', then the 'scientific' phenomenon\nand finally the 'pure' (or archetypal) phenomenon, stages which are\ndi tinct but closely interconnected. The fir t tep for Goethe was\nalways the attentive, objective observation of the natural object, u ing\nall the senses and free of any preconceptions. He de cribes this as a\nkind of self-denial which would allow the pure t pas ible assimilation\nof the phenomenon. 24 Thi sound very reminiscent of Rousseau's\navowed aim but, a we shall see, Goethe ucceeded in putting theory\ninto practice in a much more radical and s stematic way. As he says in\nhi essay 'Experiment as Mediator between Object and Subject',\nwritten in 1793: 'Thus the true botanist will not allow the beauty nor\nthe u e of plant to divert him; he will examine their formation and\ntheir relation to the re t of the plant kingdom. Just as they all are\nconjured forth by the sun's rays which shine on all, 0 shall he look\nupon them and cognize them with the same quiet gaze, taking the\n220 JA E WALLl G\nstandards for such knowledge, the data to guide his judgment, not\nfrom himself but from the circle of the thing which he observe '.2;\nLike Rousseau he rejects the utilitarian view of plants but, unlike\nRousseau - who, as he himself says in the Reveries, instinctively\npreferred the most agreeable object (p. 136; p. 120) - he also refuses\nto be influenced by their beauty. The obser er of natur , Goethe goe\non to say, mu t forego 'the standard of plea ure or displea ure,\nattraction or repulsion, use or harm'. we shall ee in more detail\nlater, hi criteria for 'judging' them come from the plant them el es,\nthat is, are ecocentric rather than anthropocentric.\nIt is also worth pointing out that, unlike mo t botanists of the time\nwith their habit of examining uprooted plants in a herbarium, for\nwhich, as we ha e seen, Rous eau al 0 had a predilection, Goethe\npursued hi studies outdoors as much a pos ible. 26 As a result, he\nbecame not only increa ingly convinced that plant forms varied con-\nsiderably according to the habitat in which they grew but also\nincreasingly dis atisfied with the rigidity of Linnean cla sification. 27\nHis travels (particularly to Italy) revealed to him the important\nformative influence of factors uch as climate, temperature, humidity\nand condition of the soil. In other word, Goethe thought that a plant\ncould only be fully understood when the precise and intimate\nrelationship between a particular specimen and a particular eco ystem\nwas taken into account. Indeed it is for thi idea and its development\nthat Goethe i particularly well-known: Rudolf Magnu refers to him\nas 'the founder of comparative morphology in botany' (p. ix).\nThe second step for the' aturschauer' (the term Goethe preferred\nto the more common' aturforscher') was then to turn away from the\nobject and attempt to produce an exact mental equivalent, imaginatively\nconjuring it up in one' mind's eye. This proces he called 'exakte\ninnliche Phantasie', literally translated a 'exact sensorial imagination',\nwhich mean that one i perceiving the object in imagination as if with\nthe senses, thinking the object rather than thinking about it. 28 More\npecifically, this kind of seeing is concerned with the relationships\nbetween the qualities ob erved and thus allows one to experience the\nplant's growth process. The' aturschauer' is, a it were, creating the\nflower in his\/her imagination, participating in the act of its creation or,\na Goethe himself put it, 'recreating in the wake of ever-creating\nature' (' achschaffen einer immer chaffenden atur').29 In other\nword, he or he is internally reproducing the coming into being of the\nplant, imaginatively participating in its generative movements, rather\nBotany in Rousseau and Goethe 221\nthan visualising a static mental equivalent. Whereas Linne organized\nplants into species and genera by comparing individual parts (leaves,\nsepal , petal, tamen etc.) a they occur in different specimens,\nGoethe saw the plant holistically: 'He discovered another dimension in\nthe plant, an intensive depth, in which these different organs are\nintimately related'.30 What he in fact discovered was continuity of fonn.\nThi can be seen in what is probably the best-known example of\nGoethean science, observation of the leaf type of a single plant, a\npractice which demonstrates a new intuitive way of understanding\nplant development. This exercise in fact represent just the first stage\nin Goethe's investigations into metamorphosis, to which, for the\npurpo es of clarity and brevity, we will be limiting our elves here. It\ninvolves 'the method of erial arrangement of the phenomena to be\ninve tigated ... the one that Goethe made his very own' (Magnus, p.\n54). Thus, in order to make a leaf sequence, all the leaves of a plant are\nlaid out in the order in which they were formed, from the oldest, most\nbasal leaves to the newest most apical ones. It soon become apparent\nthat there is a great variety of hape and sizes and that no ingle leaf\ncan be seen as representative. The observer look at one leaf after the\nother, filling in the gaps between each with the imagination, thereby\nwith practice creating a mooth mental continuum. In the physical\nworld the plant is frozen in a moment of time. But mental visualisation\nenables one to link the various leaves like frames of a moving picture\ninto a fluid metamorpho is from one form into another. Goethe\nhimself described how he grasped the metamorphic process in the\nfollowing words:\nIf 1 look at the created object, inquire into its creation, and follow thi proce\nback a far as 1 can, I will find a erie of step . Since the e are not actually een\ntogether before me, I mu t visualise them in my memory 0 that they form a\ncertain ideal whole. At first 1 will tend to think in term of steps, yet nature leaves\nno gaps, and thu , in the end, I will have to see this progression of uninterrupted\nactivity as a whole. I can do so by dissolving the particular without de troying the\nimpression it elf (Hoffmann, p. (33).\nThis exerci e of 'exact sensorial imagination' gives one a heightened\ninner perception of the flow of energies in the plant and with this\nexperience we arrive at the third stage in the Goethean method. Here\nthe movement and inner necessity of plant growth, what Goethe calls\nthe plant's fonnative gesture, (or its 'fonnative life-principles\" Hoffmann,\np. 134) can be directly experienced in the imagination. Patterns\nbecome apparent which are not perceptible to the analytical, logical\n222 JA E WALLI G\nintellect. It is important to stres that what i being imaginatively\nexperienced here i not one physical form developing into another\nsince all these leaves are adult stem form and not stages of any other;\nrather it is the formative process itself which is being transformed as it\nproduces successive leaves on the tern. In other word, metamorpho is\nfor Goethe is 'not the outward alteration of one form into another but\nthe differing outward expressions of an inward idea'3 1 or archetype, the\n'pure phenomenon'. The unity of the plant i in the formative move-\nment which generates the variou physical manife tations.\nHere an important contrast with Rou seau becomes apparent. For\nGoethe Rousseau's approach i flawed in that it fail to take adequate\naccount of the fact that the flowering plant is not a fixed, unchanging\nobject to be di sected, but is both in a con tant proce s of development\nand subject to considerable variation. It is, in other word , a proce\nrather than a finished product. As Charles Davy puts it: 'The plant\nworld a ks for a schooling of the imagination not towards 'objectivity'\n(the grasping of objects) but toward participatory movement (thinking\nwith processes)'Y Goethe felt that conventional botany made the\nmi take of treating the organic realm as if it were inorganic, whereas\nthe former in hi opinion requires a quite different form of cognition\nwhich he called ' ernunft' (rea on) by contrast with the 'Ver tand'\n(understanding) appropriate to the latter. This opposition is neatly\nsummari ed in one of hi 'Maxims and Reflection ': 'Reason concerns\nwhat is becoming; under tanding what ha become' .33 Thi might also\nbe characterised a the difference between taxonomy on the one hand,\nand morphology on the other. It is interesting to compare thi notion\nwith Henri Berg on's discussion in his 'L'evolution crcatrice' (1907) of\nthe kind of self-contradiction that appears when we try to grasp motion\nby rational thought (a illustrated in Zeno's famous paradox of the\nflying arrow, for example). Berg on recognised that this reflected an\nintrinsic limitation of the analytical mind it elf, and he con idered the\npossibility of a transformation of con ciousne s into a more intuitive\nmode whereby the reality of change itself can be experienced directly.J4\nThi mode would also, for example, be the appropriate means of\nappreciating music.\nGoethean science with its 'pictorial-dynamic contemplation of the\nense-world'35 represents just such a tran formation of con ciousnes .\nThis more intuitive mode permits direct experience of the e sential\nspecificity of the plant in a way that is not possible with conventional\nbotany. It could be aid that the latter (and indeed Rousseau) are\nBotany in Rousseau and Goethe 223\nconcerned with studying rla\/ura natura\/a, nature as a serie. of created\nproducts or observable objects, (a more analytical understanding of\nseparate constituent parts), whereas Goethe is attempting to penetrate\nthrough these in order to intuit the formative proce ses at work in\n1lalura nall\/ranS, nature as a creative, dynamic force, an initiative centre\nof activity. (These terms originate with St Thomas Aquinas and\nScholastic thought.) However, as we have seen, the unique gesture of a\nliving being can only be imaginatively and precisely reproduced once\nits total material reality has been as imilated. In other words, this\napproach to botany \\\\'ould seem to reconcile not only the senses and\nthe intellect\/' but also the scientific and the imaginative. What is\nmore, Goethe's approach is genuinely ecocentric in that it reject the\nfalse anthropomorphism of the pathetic fallacy or the exploitation of\nplants in order to fulfil other human needs by allowing the pheno-\nmenon to speak for it. elf.\nIt will thus be apparent that, while Goethe's approach to botany\nclearly is influenced by and builds on Rousseau's, the two are nonethe-\nless based on very divergent paradigms. The epi temology underlying\nRousseau's scientific and autobiographical writing about plants is\nfundamentally Cartesian: the onlooker is detached from the object of\nstudy, consciousnes' and nature are irrevocably separated, plant are\n'machines vi\\'antcs' (Rh:cries, p. 132; p. I 15) which are to be either\nintellectually understood or emotionally and aesthetically appreciated.\nGoethe's botanical writings, however, are based on the non-dualistic\npremise that human consciousness is parI of nature and that, by\nobserving its activity in the right way, we can become participants in\nits productivity, '(lass wir uns, durch das Anschauen einer immer\ntatigcn atur, zur gcistigcn Teilnahme an ihren Produktionen wurdig\nmachten' (Bbhme, p. 155). The 'participatory epistemology' underlying\nthis approach to nature is described thus by Richard Tamas: 'from\nwithin its own depths the imagination directly contacts the creative\nprocess within nature, realizes that proces within itself and brings\nnature's reality to conscious expression. Hence the imaginal intuition is\nnot a subjective distortion but is the human fulfilment of that reality's\nessential wholeness'. 'The human mind', he says, 'is ultimately the\norgan of the world's own process of self-revelation... ature's reality\n... comes into being through the very act of human cognition'.J7 In\nconclusion it could thus perhaps be said that Rousseau's writing about\nbotany illustrates a problem to which Goethe provides a possible\nsolution.\n224-\nOTES\nJA E WALLJ G\nI Glen A.
