It \nimplies for these two theorists of the social, a particular form of relation between human \nbeings and objects. In the work of both the idea of the fetish involves attributing properties to \nobjects that they do not 'really' have and that should correctly be recognised as human. While \nMarx's account of fetishism addresses the exchange-value of commodities at the level of the \neconomic relations of production, it fails to deal in any detail with the use-value or \nconsumption of commodities. In contrast Freud's concept of the fetish as a desired substitute \nfor a suitable sex object explores how objects are desired and consumed. Drawing on both \nMarx and Freud, Baudrillard breaks with their analyses of fetishism as demonstrating a \nhuman relation with unreal objects. He  explores the creation of value in objects through the \nsocial exchange of sign values, showing how objects are fetishised in ostentation. This paper \nargues that while Baudrillard breaks with the realism characteristic of Marx's and Freud's \nanalyses of fetishism, he does not go far enough in describing the social and discursive \npractices in which objects are used and sometimes transformed into fetishes. It is proposed \nthat the fetishisation of objects involves an overdetermination of their social value through a \ndiscursive negotiation of the capacities of objects that stimulates fantasy and desire for them. \n \n3 \nIntroduction \nThe social sciences have, in general, shown a lack of interest in relations \nbetween human beings and the material objects in their environment. What \nhas taken centre stage is either the human individual or the relations between \nhumans that constitute both social interaction and social structure. Marx and \nFreud were both key contributors to the emerging human sciences who have \nexerted enormous influence. The major focus of both is on the form and \nantecedence of human identity and relations between humans but both have \nused the term 'fetishism' to begin to describe human relations with material \nobjects; non-human things in the world with which pseudo-human relations \nare established.  \nFor Marx the reality of the commodity is its representation of congealed labour \nthrough which it derives its value. In its unreal or fetishised form the \ncommodity appears to have intrinsic value derived from its material character. \nThe fetishised commodity represents a misconception of the origins of value - \nthe system of ideas supporting capitalist production that Marx calls \n'commodity fetishism'. For Freud the reality of shoes or undergarments is as \nclothes, as items worn as part of normal apparel. But the unreal or fetish form \nof the shoe or undergarment is, for the fetishist, an agent of sexual arousal.  \nIn Freud's work the unreal object that arouses the fetishist indicates a \nperversion. Its origins lie in a misconception of the lack in the female genitalia \nthat leads to a substitute for the proper sexual object. \nIn the work of Marx and Freud the term 'fetishism' is used to identify a \nmisunderstanding of the world in which properties are attributed to objects \nthat can only correctly be attributed to human beings. The use of the term \nallows them to connect these misunderstandings to a pre-humanistic scheme \nin which spirits, sometimes residing within material objects, were treated as a \nsignificant part of the ontological order of the world. Their use of the terms \n'fetish' and 'fetishism' continue a tradition of cultural critique with its origins in \ncommentary on religious practices surrounding objects. To identify a fetish is \nto expose the inadequate beliefs of those who revere it for what they believe it \nis capable of, by pointing to the real, material, qualities of the object and \nidentifying its presumed capacities as really residing elsewhere - in the 'true' \ngod; in human labour; in arousal by a person of the opposite sex. \nTreating fetishes as 'unreal' overlooks the importance of the object as a \nmediator of social value. Marx did not explore why some commodities might \n4 \nbe more fetishised than others. Freud conjectured on the symbolic origins of \nsexual fetishes but did not explore the meaning of fetishes systematically as \nhe did dream contents. What I want to explore in this paper is how the term \nfetish might be used analytically, not to critique or debunk a set of ignorant \nbeliefs or deviant perceptions, but to explore how material objects are valued \nin cultural contexts. \nAfter mentioning the origins of the term 'fetishism' and how it might be defined, \nI shall look at how Marx and the psychoanalytic tradition have used the term \ncritically to undermine a perspective or mode of life. Despite treating material \nobjects as no more than they 'really' are (their concrete and material function) \nMarx recognised that the need for objects is in part determined culturally and \nFreud noted that fetishism is not always deviant but may express a 'normal' \nsexual interest in objects. \nIt is Baudrillard who begins to treat fetishism as a sign of social value; the \nfetish object is taken to stand for the owner's social status. Here the fetish is \nno longer an unreal object, believed to have properties it does not really have, \nbut is a means of mediating social value through material culture. I will \nsuggest that Baudrillard's use of the term fetishism can be extended to look at \nthe way some objects are overdetermined at the level of social value. \nMaking the fetish \nAlthough related to the Latin word factitius (= made by art), the contemporary \nEnglish word fetish seems to derive from the Portuguese word feiti\u00e7o (= a \ncharm, sorcery) a name for talismans in the middle ages that were often \nillegal or heretical (Pietz 1985: 6). The Portuguese word was used to refer to \nwitchcraft and was part of the language of sailors in the 15th Century \ntravelling from Portugal to the Guinea coast of West Africa (Pietz 1987: 24). \nThe modern meaning of fetish and fetishism is generally agreed to have \noriginated in the work of Charles de Brosses writing in 1760 who used the \nterm to describe the religious practices of worshipping objects (Pietz 1993: \n134; Simpson 1982: 127). De Brosses coined the term to refer to the worship \nof inanimate objects as gods, a practice that had been recorded by travellers \nto West Africa. It is clear that Marx read de Brosses and it is from his proto-\nanthropological analysis that Marx derives his 1842 definition of the term as \nthe 'religion of the senses': \n5 \nThis notion of the fetish worshipper's desire-driven \ndelusion regarding natural objects, his blindness to the \nunprovidential randomness of physical events was an \nelement in de Brosses's original theorisation of \nf\u00e9tichisme as the pure condition of un-enlightenment. \n(Pietz 1993: 136) \nThe connections between the origins of the word 'fetishism', its \n'anthropological' meaning and Marx's usage are clear and documented. The \nconnection with its use in psychoanalysis to refer to sexual fixation on an \nobject is not so clear. According to Robert Nye, in a paper of 1882 Charcot \nand Magnan referred to what we have come to know as classical sexual \nfetishism (erotic obsessions for aprons, shoes, shoe nails) but did not use this \nterm. In 1887 Alfred Binet, Charcot's student, used the term in a paper \ndiscussing these perversions in the context of religious fetishism (Nye 1993: \n21; Gamman and Makinen 1994: 17). In 1886 Krafft Ebing had treated \n'fetichism' as a pathological tendency, connected to stealing female linen, \nhandkerchiefs and shoes. While he emphasised the criminological aspect he \nalso connected it to sexuality (Gamman and Makinen 1994: 39). Quite how \nsexual fetishism is linked with the religious fetishism described by de Brosses \nremains unclear. However, the term fetishism seems to have taken on its \nbroad cultural meanings by the middle of the nineteenth century so that the \nShorter OED can offer as a figurative definition dating from 1837 \"something \nirrationally reverenced\".  \nThere are then three fields in which the term fetishism is used that we may \ntreat as; proto-anthropology, the analysis of the commodity form and the \nanalysis of sexual perversion. The term seems to originate in the first of these \nfields and is then employed analogously in the latter two. Gamman and \nMakinen sum up its use in all three fields: \nFetishism, we would argue, is by definition a \ndisplacement of meaning through synecdoche, the \ndisplacement of the object of the desire onto something \nelse through processes of disavowal. (Gamman and \nMakinen 1994: 45) \nIt is through the displacement of desire that an object acquires special social \nvalue, indicated by the reverence, worship or fascination with which it is \ntreated. That desire may be for religious, economic or erotic value (the three \n6 \nfields in which fetishism has been described) which then accrues in the object. \nWhat the Gamman and Makinen definition does is to suspend the realist \naccount of fetishism by treating it as a displacement of meaning rather than a \nmistake or misunderstanding about the real nature of objects. \nA fetish is created through the veneration or worship of an object that is \nattributed some power or capacity, independently of its manifestation of that \ncapacity. However, through the very process of attribution the object may \nindeed manifest those powers; the specialness with which the object is \ntreated makes it special. The fetish object will, for example, influence the lives \nof its human worshippers, determining some of their actions and modifying \ntheir beliefs. In this process the object is mediating the powers delegated to it \nby worshippers. As with all mediation, the fetish is not merely reflecting back \nthe ideas and beliefs of its worshippers, it is transforming them or, in the \nlanguage of actor-network theory, 'translating' them (Callon 1991). The power \nof the fetish is not reducible to its material form any more than the meaning of \na word can be reduced to its material representation (its sound or graphic \nshape). The symbolic power of the fetish can be repeated or replicated \nprovided that there is some basis for continuity that is recognisable to the \nworshipper. The graven image can be copied, the form of the animal is \nrepeated in each example of the species, shoes can be endlessly exchanged \nas commodities and join countless others in a collection.  \nThe meaning of the specific object is apparent only in a series of objects. The \nthing to be venerated is distinguished from those to be treated as rubbish or \nas mere utensils. Such distinctions are embedded within cultural codes that \nare emergent in sets of practices within the culture. This is precisely why the \nfetish object cannot be decoded by a realist perspective in any transcultural \nway; what is 'real' in one cultural code is 'unreal' in another. To use the term \n'fetish' in a realist mode is to engage in cultural critique; it is to identify \nsomeone else's reality as an illusion, an unreality. I wish to argue that both \nMarx and Freud use the term fetishism in this realist mode to engage in forms \nof cultural critique. But there are chinks in the theoretical positions of both \nwhich permit a more reflexive position on fetishism to be drawn out. \nCommodity fetishism  \nIn the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts Marx uses the term 'fetish-\nworshippers' to describe the supporters of the monetary and mercantile \nsystem and how they looked upon private property. Following Engels, he \n7 \ncompares the fetishism of the mercantilists to that revealed by Luther's \ncritique of the paganism and external religiosity of Catholicism. The objects of \nprivate property stand in for real human relations and so appear to have a \npower that is their own whereas the political economists' critique shows that \nhuman labour is the essence of private property. Of course Marx goes on to \ncriticise the political economists for not identifying the contradictory essence \nof private property as the product of alienated labour.   \nWhereas in proto-anthropology the term 'fetish' referred to the cultural \nmeanings and uses of certain objects, in Marx's account the term is used to \ncriticise more general beliefs about capitalist culture. Nothing more specific \nthan 'private property' in general is identified as the fetish object (although \nlater in the Manuscripts Marx does specify metal money as a fetish, referring \nto the dazzle of its \"sensuous glitter\" (Marx 1975: 364)).  \nIn the later, more famous, account of fetishism in Capital, Marx follows a very \nsimilar line but here the analysis is of the commodity form rather than private \nproperty. The 'real' value of a commodity is analysed as a social relation \ndetermined by the amount of labour that has gone into its production - it is \nnothing to do with the material form of the commodity (Marx 1976: 165). The \nexchange value of commodities appears to be something intrinsic to them as \nobjects and their relationship as things. But this form of their value is illusory \nsince the fetishised exchange establishes a fantastic relationship between \nthings that obscures the real relationship between people - workers whose \nlabour produces things of value to others2. The cultural forms which \nincorporate such 'fantasies', mistaking them for reality, are critiqued by Marx \nin his analysis of commodity fetishism in Capital.  \nMarx distinguishes the use-value of objects (the use they have to the human \nlabourer) from their exchange-value (the fetishised, fantastic form of value \nthey have as commodities). Use-values are to do with the quality of objects \nand are only realised in use or consumption whereas exchange values are \nquantifiable in terms of other commodities (Marx 1976: 126-128). As \nBaudrillard points out (1981: 130-4), Marx restricts his analysis of commodity \nfetishism to exchange-value whilst use-value remains \"an abstraction\" a \nresidual category, prior to and outside the economic relations of socially \nassigned value, of equivalence and of quantity.   \nThe difficulty with Marx's analysis is that it obscures the processes of \nconsumption and the links between use-value and exchange-value. Exchange \n8 \ninvolves consumption and judgements about the relative quality of similar \ngoods (e.g. their fitness for purpose, their substitutability) which in turn lead to \nconferring social value on goods which affects the determination of economic \nvalue. These judgements are derived from the exchange of signs concerning \nthe relative merits and capacities of goods to meet needs. They are realised \nas the desire for a particular object which is then expressed in the willingness, \ngiven sufficient capacity, to exchange for it. That objects might have some \ncomplex form of social value (beauty, functionality, longevity) is overlooked by \nMarx in order to emphasise the basis of economic value in human labour.  \nIt seems as if Marx, especially in the first chapters of Capital, takes needs as \nbiologically given and the natural, qualitative use-value of goods as the same \nin all societies (Sahlins 1976: 148-161)3. But Sahlins points out that in the \nGrundrisse Marx showed how consumption was part of the process by which \nthe use-value of objects emerges: \n... the object is not an object in general, but a specific \nobject which must be consumed in a specific manner, to \nbe mediated in its turn by production itself. Hunger is \nhunger, but the hunger gratified by cooked meat eaten \nwith a knife and fork is a different hunger from that \nwhich bolts down raw meat with the aid of hand, nail and \ntooth. Production thus produces not only the object but \nalso the manner of consumption, not only objectively \nbut also subjectively. (Marx 1973: 92) \nMarx is still describing a real basis for the use-value of objects that is a natural \ngiven - here the biological need of 'hunger'. But reality is not presented as a \nfixed, stable state against which fetishised forms can be distinguished. The \nnature of the object changes and so must its use-value in a dialectical process \nof production and consumption. Sahlins suggests that the absence of a theory \nof meaning is the reason for Marx's failure to deal adequately with the social \nrelations of material objects; it is through their socially construed meaning that \nthey come to have specific use-values that vary with different modes of \nconsumption (1976: 151). \nSexual fetishism \nFreud follows previous usage by Binet (in a paper from 1888) of the term \nfetishism in discussions of sexual perversion. Fetishistic perversions were \n9 \nregarded as \"the degrading consequences of a weakening of morals in a \nprofoundly vitiated society\" (Charcot and Magnan quoted in Nye 1993: 21) but \nit was Binet who identified the 'psychic impotence' characteristic of the sexual \nobsession with a part of the body or inanimate objects that went with a \ndecadent and enfeebled culture. The critique of sexual deviations and \nperversions by the French writers on deviation (who Matlock says called \nthemselves ali\u00e9nistes, 1993: 32) was, Robert Nye suggests, tied to a \nparticularly French anxiety about the health and size of the population at the \nend of the nineteenth century.  \nFreud treats fetishism as a deviation from the 'normal' sexual aim of \ncopulation leading to the release of sexual tension \"...a satisfaction analogous \nto the sating of hunger (Freud 1977a : 61). It involves a sexual overvaluation4 \nof a substitute object, that while related to the sex object is nonetheless \nunsuited to the normal sexual aim. Fetish objects include parts of the body \n(the foot, hair) and objects which are connected to the person for whom they \nsubstitute (clothing or underclothes). Freud is quite clear that fetishism, along \nwith other deviations in sexual aim, is not in itself indicative of neuroses or \nmental illness. It is only when it goes to extremes in overcoming the \nresistance of shame, disgust, horror or pain (he gives the examples of licking \nexcrement or of intercourse with dead bodies) that these sorts of deviations \nbecome pathological. What he suggests is that it is normal to make additions \nor extensions to the normal sexual aim, substituting objects for the 'real' thing \n(the union of genitals): \nA certain degree of fetishism is thus habitually present \nin normal love, especially in those stages of it in which \nthe normal sexual aim seems unattainable or its \nfulfilment prevented. (Freud 1977a: 66) \nThere is only a problem with fetishism when the object substitutes completely \nfor the real thing and when the diversity of sexual objects channelling the sex \ndrive towards the real thing is replaced by a single sex object which is \n'overvalued'.  \nThe sexual fetish is then a symbolic substitute that has an analogous or \nmetonymical association with the normal sex object (e.g. fur as a fetish is a \nsymbolic substitute for a woman's pubic hair - Freud 1977a: 68). In his paper \nof 1927 on Fetishism Freud suggests that the fetish is a substitute for the \nlack of a penis in the little boy's mother. The boy child who is later to be a \n10 \nfetishist disavows the discovery fearing that if she has been castrated then he \nmight be too. However, the disavowal is not an effective denial; the boy child \nhas retained his belief that women have a penis but he has also given it up \n(Freud 1977b: 353). The contradiction is resolved by the belief that the \nwoman does have a penis but it is no longer the same; something has been \nappointed as its substitute - the fetish. Freud says that it is not possible to \nunravel the associative origins of a particular fetish with any certainty though \nthey are likely to lie in the frozen memory of the moment of discovering the \nlack. The last thing seen before the realisation that the mother is not phallic \nbecomes a symbolic substitute for the phallus that is not there (shoes, fur, \nvelvet, underclothing)  (Freud 1977b: 354-355). \nIt seems as if the fetish is only available as a sex object for men but Jann \nMatlock points to the connection between cross dressing by women and \nclothing fetishes (1993). Elizabeth Grosz follows the line, suggested by Freud, \nthat in pampering herself, what the narcissistic woman does is to treat her \nwhole body it as if it were a phallus thereby fetishising it (Grosz 1993 - a \nsimilar point is made by Baudrillard 1993: 107-110). However, the lesbian \nlover, suggests Grosz, like the fetishist disavows women's castration, but this \nis her own castration not that of her mother. And also like the fetishist, the \nlesbian takes as a substitute for the phallus, an object outside her own body; \nthe body of her lover. Gamman and Makinen (1994) argue that the traditional \npsychoanalytic account of fetishism androcentrically focuses the articulation of \ndesire on the penis and its lack. Using an account of sexual fetishism modified \nthrough Kleinian theory, they propose a less gendered and genitaled account \nof fetishism that incorporates oral and other gratifications whilst retaining the \ndisavowal of the fetishist. This enables them to extend the use of the term \nfetishism to include pathological and non-pathological relations with clothes \nand food that express an ambivalence about identity but provide a source of \nreal gratification (1994: 111). Their gendered but balanced account of different \nmechanisms of adult perversity explains how sexual fetishism occurs \npredominantly - but not exclusively - in men, eating obsessions and the \nobsessive consumption of style are predominantly but not exclusively female \nfetishes.   \nDeprived of its phallocentrism the psychoanalytic account of fetishism focuses \non the dynamics of human desire for objects substitute or 'stand in' for \nsomething human. Freud, and Binet before him, both recognised that desire \nfor objects is a normal part of human existence. Fetishism might be born of a \n11 \nfrustration or confusion of normal desire, a sublimation or redirection of sexual \nneeds, but this is almost characteristic of the human condition. It is neither \npathological nor in itself destructive of human social being5. \nSemiotic fetishism \nA recurrent theme in Jean Baudrillard's work is the relationship between the \nsocial subject and the object. To begin with the object is material and distinct \nfrom the subject but as his theory develops, the object becomes progressively \nmore enravelled with the subject, as inscription on the body and later as a \nsocial object that incorporates subject positions, ideas as well as material \nform. This theoretical development goes against Marx's clear distinction \nbetween subject and object that asserts the primacy of the human subject. \nFor Baudrillard the fetish is the site of a merging or confusion of subject and \nobject and, especially in the later work, the object seems to be primary. \nIn his early work Baudrillard criticises Marx's analysis of commodity fetishism, \narguing that use-value is a fetishised social relation just as much as \nexchange-value (1981: 131). The object that is to become a commodity, \navailable for exchange, must be valued according to a code of functionality \nwhich orders both human subjects and material objects (1981: 130-4). Use-\nvalue is not an inherent property of the object nor functionality reflective of \ninnate human needs or desires. For Baudrillard the 'object', the thing that has \na use is \"nothing but the different types of relations and significations that \nconverge, contradict themselves and twist around it\" (1981: 63). The object of \nconsumption does not exist in relation to pure, natural, asocial, human needs \nbut is produced as a sign in a system of relations of difference with other \nobjects. The process of consumption Baudrillard understands not as the \nrealisation of objective needs or of economic exchange but as the social \nexchange of signs and values (1981: 75). \nBaudrillard describes objects as signs in a code of significatory value can be \nmanipulated between the two registers of functionality and ostentation \n(Veblen's conspicuous consumption). Both registers can be part of the same \nobject so the useless gadget combines \"pure gratuitousness under a cover of \nfunctionality, pure waste under a cover of practicality\" (Baudrillard 1981: 32). \nNow, it is the extent to which an object demonstrates ostentation, a sign of \nvalue that accrues to the possessor of the object that turns the object into a \nfetish.  \n12 \nThe television set that is broken but retains its prestige value in a culture in \nwhich hardly anybody can afford a television is an example of the \"pure fetish\" \n(1981: 55). But in western culture it is in the ritual that surrounds the object, \nthe routines and practices of watching the television that give it its fetish \ncharacter (1981: 56). The television functions as a machine that mediates \ncommunications but it is also an object that is consumed in itself, signifying \nmembership of the community as a \"token of recognition, of integration, of \nsocial legitimacy\" (1981: 54). The 'worship' of the television set is through \n\"systematic, non-selective viewing\" and the \"apparent passivity of long hours \nof viewing\" that actually hides a \"laborious patience\" (1981: 55). The television \ntakes up a place in our homes, requires a reorganisation of other objects that \ninhabit them and demands a certain level of commitment in return for the \nminimal level of social status it confers. Objects like the television have a sign \nvalue that is in excess of their functional capacities. Each object \"... finds \nmeaning with other objects, in difference, according to a hierarchical code of \nsignifications\" (Baudrillard 1981: 64). \nIt is the system of objects as sign values and their exchange that Baudrillard \nterms \"consummativity\" (1981: 83), a dynamic of capitalist society that he \njuxtaposes to productivity. Consummativity is the system of needs for objects \nimposed on individual consumers - it includes their need for choice. Needs \ncannot be derived from a humanistic notion of the free, unalienated, asocial \nindividual driven by craving or pleasure or even by some essential needs. \nConsumer needs are mobilised within individuals by the \"strategy of desire\" \n(1981: 85), an ideological effect of the social system achieved through the \ngeneralised exchange of signs. It is through the circulation of objects as signs \nthat the quality or use-value of objects is distinguished. \nBaudrillard takes Marx to task for using the metaphor of fetishism to avoid an \nanalysis of the ideological labour involved in consumption6. Taking up the \npsychoanalytic use of fetishism as a refusal of sex differences \"a perverse \nstructure that perhaps underlies all desire\" (1981: 90), Baudrillard points out \nthat the fetish object involves a fetishism of the signifier, a passion for the \ncode. The fetishism of commodities as objects is the fascination and worship \nof the system of differences, the code of signs that the object or good \nrepresents. The system of objects as signs is continually shifting emphasis \nfrom one term to another so that, unlike the perverse desire of the sexual \nfetishist, the perverse desire of the commodity fetishist is constantly being \n13 \nredirected. In describing how the beauty of the body is fetishised, Baudrillard \npoints out that a model of beauty is constructed so that... \nIt is the sign in this beauty, the mark (makeup, \nsymmetry, or calculated asymmetry, etc.) which \nfascinates; it is the artifact that is the object of desire. \n(Baudrillard 1981: 94) \nThe make-up of 'beauty', of the erotic body, is a process of 'marking it'  though \nornamentation, jewellery, perfume or through 'cutting it up' into partial objects \n(feet, hair, breasts, buttocks etc.). This work produces the body as a series of \nsigns, creates it as an object with a significatory value. \nFor Baudrillard the shift from the exchange of symbolic value to the exchange \nof sign value is characteristic of modernity and \"properly constitutes the \nideological process\" (1981: 98). The symbolic object had a direct if ambivalent \nrelationship with the person; in the Aztec and Egyptian cultures the sun \nprovided life-giving heat and light but was worshipped because it could also \ntake life away. In modern cultures the object as a sign is exchangeable in a \nseries with other signs (the vacation sun, the sun-lamp, the gym) in an \nideological system (the healthy body) through which they can be fetishised. \nWithin this exchange of sign values, fetishism is the \"fascination\" felt both by \nindividuals and by the culture as a whole with those signs that have been \npositively valorised.  \nIn modern culture fetishism articulates the subject in and through the object \nworld as signs are read and exchanged. This is not a fetishism of  symbolic \nexchange, of lived and felt relationships with objects, based on ritual, worship \nand subjugation to the power of objects. In modern cultures the merging of \nsubject and object happens on the surface of the body as it is inscribed with \nvisible marks that transform its meaning, inserting the consequent \nsubject\/object into the circulation of signs.  \nMany of the issues raised in the essay \"Fetishism and Ideology: The \nSemiological Reduction\" ([1972]1981) are reprised in \"The Body: The Mass \nGrave of Signs\" ([1976] 1993). Baudrillard looks again at how the marking of \nthe body achieves a merging of subject and object but via fetishism because \nthere is a \"symbolic articulation of lack\" (1993: 101). He lists a series of \nobjects that inscribe the surface form of the body including: \"the stripper's G-\nstring, bracelets, necklaces, rings, belts, jewels and chains\" (1993: 101). \n14 \nWhile overlapping the list of fetishising devices in the earlier essay (1981: 94) \nthe objects here are theorised, following Lacan, as 'bars' that both divide up \nthe surface of the body and semiologically separate the signifier from the \nsignified. The bar \"erects\" the body or body part into a sign of that which is \nlacking - the phallus. Even material that overlays the surface of the body, \nlipstick for example7, has the effect of inserting the body into the exchange of \nsigns of a phallic (sexual) order. In modern society the signs are read in \nrelation to the subject identity that they overlay so that: \n[t]he subject is no longer eliminated in the exchange, it \nspeculates. The subject, not the savage, is enmeshed in \nfetishism; through the investment [faire-valoir] of its \nbody, it is the subject that is fetishised by the law of \nvalue.  (Baudrillard 1993: 107) \nThe fetishisation of the body through makeup and adornment creates a \nseductive sexuality that is not grounded in real sexuality. It is no more than a \nsign or simulacra, a circulation of meaning through which the subject is \ntransformed by sign objects into a fetishised object. It is this obsession with \nsigns and \"the reduction of political economy, sexuality and eventually all \nmaterial and social reality to sign play\" that leads Kellner to brand Baudrillard \nhimself a \"sign fetishist\" (Kellner 1989: 100; 199). \nThe account of the body as a fetishised commodity, shows how monopoly \ncapitalism not only exploits the productivity of the body as labour power, \nalienating it through the commodification of labour, but also exploits the \n'consummativity' of the body, reifying it through marking its sexuality. \nHowever, Baudrillard does not comment on the (at least partially) gendered \ndistinction between the fetishised body as labour power and the fetishised \nbody of made-up beauty. As he turns away from Marx's political economic \nanalysis, Baudrillard responds to the anthropological writings of Mauss and \nBataille where in the pre-modern symbolic form of exchange between subject \nand object, devices such as tattooing insert the whole body into a symbolic \nexchange in which it can be possessed or dispossessed. What he seems to \ndisapprove of is the overwriting of the real body and its sexuality by material \nsigns in modernity and his critique harks back to the irreversibility of a material \nculture based on symbolic exchange. \nBut Baudrillard shifts ground again in later work investing the object itself with \nthe capacity to reverse the determinacy between subject and object. In \n15 \nSeduction (1990a) and Fatal Strategies (1990b), now more under the \ninfluence of Caillois and Canetti, he explores capacity of the object to \n\"seduce\" the subject, to reduce the determinative effect of the social and to \nlead the subject into the indeterminate realm of chance and the vertiginous, \nspinning body. Determination, the process of causality, even in the material \nworld, is called into question: \nThe reaction to this new state of things has not been a \nresigned abandonment of old values but rather a mad \noverdetermination, an exacerbation of these values of \nreference, function, finality and causality. (Baudrillard \n1990b: 11)  \nWhereas production was the irreversible, modern process of dominance of \nsubject over object relations, seduction emerges as the reversible, \npostmodern mode of relationship between subject and object. The result is \nnot the emergence of something new but an excess of the old values; in the \nface of indeterminacy, overdetermination becomes \"hyperdetermination\" \n(Baudrillard 1990b: 12). The fetish becomes for Baudrillard a representative of \nthe power of the object to determine the subject, to reverse causality \n(Baudrillard 1990b: 114).  \nThe prime case of the fetish is the work of art - an object which has \nconsciously and intentionally been made by a subject investing subjective \ncapacity in the object. This is the 'absolute commodity', that for Baudrillard \nfollowing Baudelaire, is beyond function and cannot be reduced to exchange \nor use-value. It becomes detached from its production to become foreign, \nitself beyond determination but nonetheless still determining human subjects \n\"it glows with a veritable seduction that comes from elsewhere\" (1990b: 118). \nThere are four problems with Baudrillard's analysis of social relations with \nobjects and with fetishes in particular. Firstly, objects seem to have only two \nsocial dimensions; function and ostentation. As I shall suggest below there \nare a number of forms of social relations with objects that could lead to \nfetishisation. Secondly, Baudrillard treats the consumption of objects simply in \nterms of the exchange of signs without exploring the relation between sign \nvalue and practical use value. Thirdly, it is not clear in his analysis to what \nextent all commodities are fetishes and, if they are, whether they have the \nsame fetish quality. After 1972 the only fetish he discusses in any detail is the \nfetishised female body. Fourthly, and this is also characteristic of his work \n16 \nafter 1972, the source of sign value is progressively disconnected from social \npractices until it becomes 'hyperdetermined'. At this point he is no longer \ninterested in the fetishisation of material objects in the mundane practices of \neveryday life. \nFetishism and the consumption of objects \nAs they identify fetish objects, Marx and Freud engage in a modernist form of \nauto-cultural critique that supersedes the critique of alien cultures and \nreligions. They discover the displacement of real human relations by unreal \nobjects in the secular culture of the nineteenth century by alienation and \nfetishism. Their critique aims for the liberation of human nature from the \nbonds of a culture in which some are free but others are either oppressed or \nrepressed, by showing what human life would be like without the inversions of \nfetishism. For Marx there is a biological 'need' for material objects that \nunderlies the processes of production, consumption and exchange. For Freud \nthe underlying normal sexual aim is a different form of hunger, the biological, \nsexual 'need' that is manifest as desire which may be redirected towards \nobjects in sexual fetishism. A sublimated erotic desire for objects is then a \nmeans by which they attain special social value. \nEveryday life in capitalism involves a set of relationships with objects that \nenable us to do what we do. This is the largely unexplicated use-value of \nobjects, their capacity to fulfil our needs. Contemporary commentators on \ncommodity fetishism (Geras 1976; Godelier 1977; Wells 1981: Jhally 1987) \nrecognise that the objects of commodity fetishism have relations with human \nbeings but they do not analyse what they are. In the Grundrisse Marx \nrecognised that need and consumption were produced and this is developed \nby Baudrillard who incorporates Freud's notion of desire into the relations \nbetween individuals and objects8. 'Need' is a product of the circulation of signs \nand objects at the ideological rather than the economic level. This provides a \nway of understanding how the fetish works as an object in everyday life \nwithout leading to neuroses9 but it does not explore the social practices in \nwhich objects are consumed and fetishised.  \nIt is somewhere between the subject and object that the fetish emerges; \n... the interesting thing about a fetish ... is that it is never \nclear ... whether it is really an object or whether it is part \nof the self. A fetish ... can be thought of as existing in a \n17 \nfree space between the subject and the object. (Levin \n1984: 42) \nBefore exploring the fetish quality of objects it is useful to sketch the more \nmundane features of consumption, the sociological form of human \nrelationships with material objects. Consumption involves four modes of \nhuman relations with material objects. Firstly a physical relation that is to do \nwith shape, colour, texture, strength, flexibility and possible movements (think \nof getting on a bus). It is this that distinguishes material objects from other \ncultural objects (such as kinship systems, myths). The physical properties of \nmaterial objects lead to a set of limitations on their capacities (the top speed \nof the bus, the number of people who can get on) thereby articulating the uses \nby subjects. But, secondly, objects are used within cultural practices that also \nspecify and constrain their use (bus time tables, regulations on numbers of \npassengers). Thirdly, objects are signs in themselves that locate the object \nwithin cultural parameters including time and space (as a London bus from \nthe 1960-70s). Fourthly, the object may provide a surface for linguistic or \nquasi-linguistic texts to play across (the advertisement on the side of the bus). \nIt is through these different modes of interaction that subjects realise the \ncapacities of material objects. Obviously some objects are experienced more \nthrough one mode than another and the orientation of the subject will affect \nthe mode (buses are largely experienced by passengers in a physical mode; \ncar drivers experience them more as signs or surfaces for messages). \nIt is in the process of consumption, which refers not merely to the purchase of \nobjects but to the use, enjoyment and disposal of the capacities of those \nobjects (Miller 1987: 190-191), that a relationship between human subjects \nand material objects is established. The human subject derives the benefit of \nvarious 'capacities' when s\/he interacts with material objects that enhance \nher\/his capacity in a number of ways:10.  \n1. Function The object extends or enhances the human physical \naction of its user11; e.g. as a tool the car actually transports its user.  \n2. Ostension The object signifies the social group membership of its \nuser: e.g. the distinction of a tiara, the clan identification of a football \nscarf.  \n3. Sexuality The object arouses its user or others or both, as a sign \nfrom a code indicating sexual action, identity and interest, through \n18 \nbodily display, sensuality or substitution; e.g. the wearing of tights or \ntight-fitting jeans.  \n4. Knowledge The object delivers knowledge to its user by storing \nsimple information or a synthetic understanding of some aspect of \nthe world; e.g. book or any other complex textual object. \n5. Aesthetics The beauty or form of the object directly moves the \nemotions of users by representing pure values; e.g. the 'object \nd'art'.  \n6. Mediation The object enables or enhances communications \nbetween humans; e.g. a telephone; the decorative item that is a \ntalking point; the heirloom that links generations. \nMany objects will deliver more than one of these six capacities in different \ndegrees. The capacities of objects are not a consequence of the object's \nmaterial form but emerge in the social and material milieu in which it is \nconsumed - no doubt the list would be refined and extended through empirical \nstudy.  \nNow, the fetish quality of an object is the reverence or the fascination for it \nthat arises out of its capacities but is expressed over and beyond its simple \nconsumption. This fetish quality is attested through ritualistic practices that \ncelebrate or revere the object, a class of objects, items from a 'known' \nproducer or even the brand name of a range of products. These ritualistic \npractices will involve expressing desire for the object and fantasising about its \ncapacities prior to its consumption. The object itself becomes a sign for these \nfantasised and desired capacities so that its use or enjoyment can re-\nstimulate the play of fantasy and desire. Unlike sexual fetishism where the \nfantasy is usually personal, the fetishism of consumption involves the social \nnegotiation and sharing of the value of the object so the ritualistic practices \nthat fetishise objects will involve discursive action related to the object and its \ncapacities. Expressing desire for and approval of the object and its capacities, \ncelebrating the object, revering it, setting it apart, displaying it, extolling and \nexalting its capacities, eulogising it, enthusiastic use of it, are the sorts of \npractices that fetishise objects. The cumulative effect of these practices \namount to an overdetermination12 of the social value of the object in that it is \nnot merely consumed (exchanged and used) but in addition the object or \n19 \nclass of objects can be enjoyed at the level of imagination (fantasy and \ndesire). \nOne way that social value is overdetermined is through the demonstration of \nexcess capacity in the object which cannot be used other than as a sign of \nvalue. An example would be the car that has an excess of power; the power \ncannot actually be used on the road but driving the car allows it to act as a \nsign of that power. The excess in capacity of the object is one way of marking \nthe reverence with which it is treated; a photograph of a leader, whether \nmassively blown up or merely given pride of place on the wall is made into a \nfetish by the reverence for its value that exceeds its mediative capacity. \nExcess of capacity suggests a latent capacity of the object to deliver human \nqualities (love, power, authority, sexuality, security, status, intellect, \nexoticism). The overdetermination of sign value focuses on these 'human' \ncapacities so that the object can substitute for these qualities in human lives. \nProvided that others (a group large and coherent enough to secure the \nmeaning of the object as a sign) recognise the extended capacities of the \nfetish object, they will also recognise the accrual of these capacities to those \nassociated with it. So, the powerful car makes its driver powerful, the revered \nphotograph confers authority on the national leader. It is not then the simple \ncapacity of the object that indicates its fetish character but what it means as a \nsign of social value. Identifying the fetish is not a matter of judging true or real \ncapacities in the object but recognising the multiple sources of positive \nvaluation that overdetermine its value. It is the cumulative effect of these \nmultiple sources that approve excess capacity and interpret its significance. \nAdvertising, critical commentary, discussions of product development, reports \nof consumer testing, as well as evaluations of objects in interpersonal \nexchanges have not only created a market for commodities but have also \ndefined modes of consumption. Public use of an object displays its capacities \nto others who might then desire to use the same or similar objects. It is \nthrough these practices that objects become fascinating, acquire a 'special \nstatus', and become revered or worshipped for how they might enhance \nhuman capacities. The process of fetishisation of consumption is much the \nsame for a work of art as it is for a style of trainer or a motor car. In this largely \ndiscursive context objects are not merely sanctified by the claims of \nproducers, commentators and critics, they are subject to a negotiation of their \ncapacities, of their usefulness to users. It is from the discursive context that \n20 \ndesire for objects emerges; to know what one wants one first has to know \nwhat it is and what it might do. \nConclusions \nBaudrillard supplements Marx's commodity fetishism by beginning to analyse \nthe fetishism of use-value and the social impact of consumativity. He \nincorporates Freud's displacement of erotic value on to objects to understand \nthe desire for objects, expressed in the circulation of signs that makes up the \nfield of consummativity. But Baudrillard's later analysis becomes concerned \nwith the indeterminate causality of the hyperreal. This analysis has the \nadvantage of not reducing to a distinction between the 'real' object and the \nfetish but it leaves him unable to analyse the complexity of lived human \nrelations with objects and to describe the source of their social value. In \ncontinuing Baudrillard's early move towards the social and away from the \nhuman, towards the semiotic and away from the real, I have begun to explore \nthe way the use and capacities of material objects can lead to fascination and \nreverence. \nThe term fetishism can refer to the relative quality of desire and fascination for \nan object that is not intrinsic but is nonetheless part of it. The reverence \nshown for its capacities supplements its material form, showing what it means \nhow it is valued in its cultural context. A classic example is a perfume with \nvery low production value but a high fetish value that is created by a series of \nsigns attached to the object through advertising, packaging, personal approval \nand recommendation that are themselves human products that communicate \nvalue. The reverence for the object is founded in its capacities to change a \nperson's smell (function), to declare their membership of a particular social \ngroup (ostension), to express their sexual identity and arouse others' sexual \ninterest (sexuality), to demonstrate their understanding of what aromas are \npleasing (knowledge) to explore the beauty of scent (aesthetics) and to \ncommunicate though this valuation of capacities with others (mediation). As \nthese capacities are identified and extolled, many times over, the perfume \nbecomes progressively fetishised. \nThe fetish quality of cars, works of art, mobile 'phones, shirts and Italian food \nis not an intrinsic or stable quality of the object. It is assigned through cultural \nmediations, a circulation of signs, including the objects themselves. It is \nrealised though a worshipful consumption of the objects in which reverence is \ndisplayed through desire for and an enthusiastic use of the object's capacities. \n21 \nThe fetishistic quality of objects varies over time and place and between \ndifferent groups of people13. This is a fetishism of objects that does not \ndistinguish their unreality from an essential material, natural or normal reality \nbut recognises, at both the material and semiotic levels, the fetish as a \ncultural production, a work of humans that is as real as anything can be. \n \n                                            \n1 An earlier version of this paper was presented to the BSA conference on \nSexualities in Social Context, 28-31st March 1994. \n2 As Himmelweit and Mohun (1981) point out, the notion of value here is \ndependent on the process of exchange, rather than of production. Objects are \nassociated with an exchange value only when they enter the market and are \npriced either in terms of quantities of other products or in terms of money. \nWhile concrete labour produces the object it is valued in the market place as \nsocially necessary labour time (Himmelweit and Mohun 1981: 233). \n3 See for example, Marx's account of those things that have not been \nfetishised, things that have a use-value but no exchange-value (1976: 131). \n4 By 'overvaluation' Freud is referring to the tendency for the sexual aim to \nextend beyond the genitals to the whole body and indeed mind of the sex \nobject - he suggests that it is rare for this deviation not to occur (Freud 1977a: \n62-63). \n5 Freud apparently said; \"...half of humanity must be classed among the \nclothes fetishists. All women, that is, are clothes fetishists.\" See Rose 1988: \n156. \n6 Kellner takes Baudrillard to task for his limited reading of Marx (1989: 36-\n39). He points out that in a number of places Marx does offer a more socio-\nhistorical account of needs and their place in consumption. See above p. 9. \n7 It is clear that much of Baudrillard's interest in the fetishism of commodites \nand the fetishistic effect of makeup comes from Baudelaire whom he \nmentions (1981: 95), quotes a large section from \"In Praise of Cosmetics\" \nfrom The Painter of Modern Life (1990a: 93) and refers to again (1990b: 116 \nfn). \n8 Even punning on the 'investissement' of the individual in an object - both an \ninvestment in the economic sense and a cathexis in the psychoanalytic sense. \n(Baudrillard 1981: 63 fn3). \n9 As Grosz remarks \"the fetishist remains the most satisfied and contented of \nall perverts (the fetishist rarely if ever seeks analysis for fetishistic behaviour - \nthe fetish never complains!)\" (1993: 114). \n10 A similar account of the different levels on which an object can be \napprehended is offered for different purposes by Eco (1977: 276). \n11 'Users' are are humans who have a career in which their experience of \nusing objects in a variety of ways common to their culture moulds their identity \nas users. My thanks to Graeme Gilloch for a number of helpful comments, \nincluding pointing out that users cannot be taken as given. \n12 i.e. value is represented many times over - see Freud 1976: 389. \n22 \n                                            \n13 See Kellner's critical discussion of Baudrillard's early work - 1989: 27-32. \nReferences: \n \nBAUDRILLARD, Jean ([1972] 1981) For a Critique of the Political Economy \nof the Sign, St. Louis: Telos Press. \nBAUDRILLARD, Jean ([1976] 1993) Symbolic Exchange and Death, \nLondon: Sage. \nBAUDRILLARD, Jean ([1979] 1990a) Seduction, London: Macmillan. \nBAUDRILLARD, Jean ([1983] 1990b) Fatal Strategies, London: Pluto. \nCALLON, Michelle (1991) \"\"Techno-economic networks and irreversibility\" in \nJ.
