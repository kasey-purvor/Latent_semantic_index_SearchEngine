Introduction. Transmitting information e\ufb03ciently across long optical waveguides is a\nbig challenge in telecommunications. Gap solitons are potential candidates to achieve this\ngoal. A gap in the linear spectrum allows solitons in spinor-like systems to propagate without\nlosing energy due to a resonant interaction with linear waves [11, 18]. For example, an optical\n\ufb01ber with a periodically varying refractive index supports gap solitons. The gap here is created\nby Bragg re\ufb02ection and resonance of waves along the grating.\nBefore their application to optical waveguides and transmission of optical pulses, gap\nsolitons have been studied in the context of spinor \ufb01eld equations in elementary particle\nphysics [19, 20] and in condensed matter physics [9]. There is an extensive literature on the\nexistence of gap solitons, but the issue of their stability, which is of paramount practical\nimportance, is still an open question for many systems.\nGap solitons were long believed to be stable. This was conjectured on the grounds\nof computer simulations [1] in (restricted) parameter regimes. Only recently Barashenkov,\nPelinovsky, and Zemlyanaya [4] showed analytically by using a perturbation theory, and\n\u2217Received by the editors March 16, 2004; accepted for publication (in revised form) by D.

In Kapitula and Sandstede [15], Evans func-\ntions are used to detect analytically the onset of an oscillatory instability (edge bifurcation)\nin near integrable systems. From an analytical point of view a di\ufb03culty in proving stabil-\nity\/instability is that the energy in these systems is bounded neither from above nor from\nbelow. Usual techniques such as energy-momentum methods or methods involving Lyapunov\nfunctionals are therefore bound to fail.\nAn often used numerical approach to eigenvalue problems is to discretize the spectral\nproblem on the truncated domain x \u2208 [\u2212L\u221e, L\u221e] (with L\u221e \u0002 1) using \ufb01nite di\ufb00erences,\ncollocation, or spectral methods, reducing it to a very large matrix eigenvalue problem. There\nare two central di\ufb03culties with this approach. First, in general, the exact asymptotic boundary\nconditions at x = \u00b1L\u221e depend on the eigenvalue \u03bb in a nonlinear way, and so application of the\nexact asymptotic boundary conditions changes the problem to a matrix eigenvalue problem,\nwhich is nonlinear in the parameter . So matrix eigenvalue solvers can no longer be used. In\nthe above papers [4, 5], arti\ufb01cial boundary conditions such as Dirichlet or periodic boundary\nconditions were applied in order to retain linearity in the spectral parameter. For a detailed\ndiscussion on arti\ufb01cial boundary conditions, see Sandstede and Scheel [23, 24]. Second, the\napproximate boundary conditions often lead to spurious discrete eigenvalues generated from\nthe fractured continuous spectrum. If the continuous spectrum is strongly stable (that is, the\ncontinuous spectrum is stable and there is a gap between the continuous spectrum and the\nimaginary axis), this does not normally generate spurious unstable eigenvalues. However, if the\ncontinuous spectrum lies on the imaginary axis (as often happens with gap solitons due to the\nHamiltonian character of the underlying system), spurious eigenvalues may be emitted into the\nunstable half plane. Indeed, Barashenkov and Zemlyanaya [5] give an extreme example, where\na large number of spurious unstable eigenvalues are generated by the matrix discretization\n(see Figure 1 in [5]). These problems prohibit their method to be used as a robust scheme to\ncheck stability when no theoretical results are given to guide the experiments.\nA robust and stable numerical scheme is still an open problem. In this paper we present\na numerical method based on the Evans function and exterior algebra which does not exhibit\nspurious unstable eigenvalues. The Evans function is a complex analytic function whose zeros\ncorrespond to eigenvalues of the spectral problem associated with the linearization about a\nsolitary wave solution. The Evans function was \ufb01rst introduced by Evans [12] and generalized\nby Alexander, Gardner, and Jones [2]. To de\ufb01ne the Evans function, one writes the wave\nequations as a system of \ufb01rst order real equations with respect to the spatial variable x, such\nthat one gets a system of the form Zx = F (Z,Zt,Ztt, . . . ). The study of linear stability of a\nsolitary wave solution Z\u0302(x) involves a linearization about Z\u0302 by writing the basic solutions as\nZ(x) = Z\u0302(x) + u(x) e\u03bbt. This will lead to a linearized problem of the form\nux = A(x, \u03bb)u , u \u2208 Cn,(1.1)\nwhere \u03bb \u2208 C is the spectral parameter and A(x, \u03bb) is a matrix in Cn\u00d7n, whose limit for x\u2192\n\u00b1\u221e exists. The solitary wave solution Z\u0302 of a partial di\ufb00erential equation is linearly unstable\nif for a spectral parameter \u03bb with \u0005(\u03bb) > 0 there exists an associated perturbation u(x),\nwhich is bounded for all x. An oscillatory instability (edge bifurcation) does happen when the\n142 G. DERKS AND G. A. GOTTWALD\ncontinuous spectrum is on the imaginary axis and one of the bounded eigenfunctions of the\ncontinuous spectrum develops into an exponentially decaying eigenfunction with \u0005(\u03bb) > 0.\nTo verify if such a bounded eigenfunction u(x) exists for a given value of \u03bb with \u0005(\u03bb) > 0,\nit is checked if the unstable manifold at x = \u2212\u221e and the stable manifolds at x = \u221e have\na non-trivial intersection. If this is the case, the solitary wave solution Z\u0302 is unstable with\npositive growth rate \u0005(\u03bb) > 0. To check the transversality condition the Evans function\nis used. Hence the Evans function can be viewed as a Melnikov function or a Wronskian\ndeterminant.\nCrucial to the initial construction of the Evans function is the distribution of the eigen-\nvalues of the \u201csystem at in\ufb01nity,\u201d that is, the matrix A\u00b1\u221e(\u03bb) which is associated with the\nlimit as x\u2192 \u00b1\u221e of A(x, \u03bb). It is assumed that no eigenvalues are on the imaginary axis1 and\nthat the number of negative eigenvalues is constant for \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, where \u039b is a simply connected\nsubset of C. Let k be the number of negative eigenvalues of A\u00b1\u221e(\u03bb) for \u03bb \u2208 \u039b. Note that in\nthe case of di\ufb00erent asymptotic behavior at x = \u00b1\u221e, as, for example, in the case of fronts, k\ncan be di\ufb00erent at x = \u00b1\u221e in general.\nThis suggests a naive approach by which one may follow the stable\/unstable manifolds\nat x = \u00b1\u221e with a standard shooting method and check their intersection using the Evans\nfunction. This may be done indeed if the dimension of these manifolds is 1. Otherwise, any\nintegration scheme will inevitably just be attracted by the eigendirection corresponding to the\nmost unstable eigenvalue. However, for most systems, the dimension of the stable\/unstable\nmanifold will be larger than 1. In this paper, we will consider a model equation with sta-\nble\/unstable manifolds of dimension 2. To keep the eigendirections orthogonal in the course of\nthe numerical integration, one may employ a Gram\u2013Schmidt orthogonalization method. How-\never, this is a nonanalytic procedure which will eventually back\ufb01re in the case of oscillatory\ninstabilities where we expect zeros of the Evans function in the complex plane. Indeed, to lo-\ncate those complex eigenvalues, Cauchy\u2019s theorem (argument principle) will be employed and\nthus an analytical method is crucial. In our numerical method, we will use exterior algebra,\nwhich allows for an analytical calculation of the Evans function.\nThe numerical method builds on the work in [3, 10], where a numerical algorithm is\ngiven for the calculation of the Evans function and applications are given to the stability and\ninstability in a \ufb01fth order KdV equation. In this paper, we will show that a similar algorithm\ncan be used to determine oscillatory instabilities (edge bifurcations). The algorithm does not\nexhibit spurious eigenvalues, and the exact asymptotic boundary conditions are built into the\nde\ufb01nition of the Evans function in an analytic way. The analyticity can then be utilized to\napply Cauchy\u2019s principle value theorem to study stability\/instability. An important feature\nof the numerical method is that it involves the use of exterior algebra to describe the system\non a higher dimensional space in which a simple shooting method can be employed. A similar\nidea is used in Brin [7] and Brin and Zumbrun [8] for dealing with instabilities in viscous \ufb02uid\n\ufb02ows.\n1The assumption on the hyperbolicity of A\u00b1\u221e(\u03bb) can be weakened (see [13, 14]).\nTHE EVANS FUNCTION AND OSCILLATORY INSTABILITIES 143\nTo illustrate our method we will consider the following coupled mode model:\n0 = i(ut + ux) + v + (|v|2 + \u03c1|u|2)u,\n0 = i(vt \u2212 vx) + u+ (|u|2 + \u03c1|v|2)v.\n(1.2)\nThis is a model for describing optical pulses in waveguides which have been grated so the\nrefractive index is varying periodically. In the case \u03c1 = 0 this equation is known in \ufb01eld\ntheory as the massive Thirring model and was shown to be completely integrable (see, for\nexample, [1, 16]). In a nonlinear optics context, one has \u03c1 = 1\/2 in periodic Kerr media [11],\nbut in other media \u03c1 may range from 0 up to in\ufb01nity [22]. Equation (1.2) has also been studied\nby Barashenkov, Pelinovsky, and Zemlyanaya [4], Barashenkov and Zemlyanaya [5], and in\na slightly modi\ufb01ed form by Kapitula and Sandstede [15]. In [4, 5] a heuristic perturbation\nanalysis is used to analyze the onset of oscillatory instabilities, and numerical study is used to\ngive a more complete picture. The numerical study encountered serious problems as discussed\nabove. In [15], a relation between the Evans function and the inverse scattering formalism is\nestablished for integrable systems. This forms the basis of a rigorous perturbation analysis\nfor perturbations of the massive Thirring model.\nThe coupled mode model (1.2) is chosen for illustration purposes, since the work in the\nprevious papers allows us to illustrate the advantages of our method. We stress, though, that\nthe method we present is general and can be applied to gap solitons in other systems as well.\nMoreover, there is no need for the system to be related to an integrable system.\n2. The numerical Evans function for the coupled mode model. The solutions and\ndynamics of (1.2) are best described by splitting o\ufb00 the real and imaginary part of the \ufb01elds\nu, v. We shall write for a solution u = Q1 + iP1 and v = Q2 + iP2 and collect the information\nin a single real solution vector Z = (Q1, Q2, P1, P2).\n2.1. The model equation and its solutions. We introduce the Lorentz transformation\nX = (x \u2212 V t)\/\u221a1\u2212 V 2 and T = (t \u2212 V x)\/\u221a1\u2212 V 2. In these boosted variables the model\nsystem (1.2) may be written in a (quasi-)multisymplectic framework as\nE[MZT +KZX ] = \u2207S(Z),(2.1)\nwhere Z = (Q1, Q2, P1, P2),\nS(Z) =\n1\n2\n[\nQ1Q2 + P1P2 + (Q\n2\n1 + P\n2\n1 )(Q\n2\n2 + P\n2\n2 )\n]\n+\n\u03c1\n2\n[\n(Q21 + P\n2\n1 )\n2 + (Q22 + P\n2\n2 )\n2\n]\n,\nE =\n\u239b\u239dE1 0\n0 E1\n\u239e\u23a0 , E1 =\n\u239b\u239de\u2212y 0\n0 ey\n\u239e\u23a0 , M =\n\u239b\u239d 0 \u03c30\n\u2212\u03c30 0\n\u239e\u23a0 , and K =\n\u239b\u239d 0 \u03c33\n\u2212\u03c33 0\n\u239e\u23a0 ,\nwith V = tanh y and the Pauli matrices \u03c30,3 de\ufb01ned as\n\u03c30 =\n\u239b\u239d1 0\n0 1\n\u239e\u23a0 and \u03c33 =\n\u239b\u239d1 0\n0 \u22121\n\u239e\u23a0 .\n144 G. DERKS AND G. A. GOTTWALD\nNote that if \u03c1 = 0, the system is invariant under this Lorentz transformation.\nThe reason for introducing this formalism is that a multisymplectic formulation allows for\na systematic linearization and also sheds light on conservation properties within the system.\nWe note that (2.1) is equivariant under action of the continuous symmetry group SO(2) acting\non R4 represented by\nG\u03c8 =\n\u239b\u239dcos(\u03c8)\u03c30 \u2212 sin(\u03c8)\u03c30\nsin(\u03c8)\u03c30 cos(\u03c8)\u03c30\n\u239e\u23a0 ,(2.2)\nsince [G\u03c8,M] = [G\u03c8,K] = [G\u03c8,E] = 0, and S(G\u03c8Z) = S(Z) for any \u03c8. According to\nNoether\u2019s theorem, there is a conservation law associated with this continuous symmetry,\nnamely, PT +QX = 0 with P and Q determined by\n\u2207P (Z) = M d\nd\u03c8\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03c8=0\nG\u03c8(Z) and \u2207Q(Z) = K d\nd\u03c8\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03c8=0\nG\u03c8(Z);(2.3)\nhence\nP (Z) =\n2\u2211\ni=1\nQ2i + P\n2\ni and Q(Z) =\n2\u2211\ni=1\n(\u22121)i+1(Q2i + P 2i ).\nNote that in the original system (1.2), this symmetry shows up as an equivariance of the\nsystem under simultaneous phaseshifts of u and v, i.e., u \b\u2192 u ei\u03c8 and v \b\u2192 v ei\u03c8.\nGoing to a frame moving with the symmetry group and writing the solutions as Z(X,T ) =\nG\u03d5(X)\u2212\u2126T Z\u02dc(X,T ), the equations (2.1) become\nE[MZT +KZX \u2212 \u2126\u2207P (Z) + \u03d5X\u2207Q(Z)] = \u2207S(Z) ,(2.4)\nwhere we dropped the tildes. Time independent solutions in the moving frame were found by\nAceves and Wabnitz [1] to be\nZ\u02c6(X) = \u03b1E\u2212\n1\n2\n\u239b\u239d\u03c33 0\n0 \u03c30\n\u239e\u23a0\n\u239b\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\nWr(X)\nWr(X)\nWi(X)\nWi(X)\n\u239e\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 ,(2.5)\nwhere\n\u2126 = cos \u03b8 (0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0), \u03d5(X) = 2\u03b12\u03c1 sinh(2y) arctan\n{\ntanh[(sin(\u03b8))X] tan \u03b82\n}\n,\n\u03b1 =\n1\u221a\n1 + \u03c1 cosh 2y\n, and W (X) = Wr(X) + iWi(X) =\nsin(\u03b8)\ncosh ((sin \u03b8)X \u2212 i\u03b8\/2) .\nTHE EVANS FUNCTION AND OSCILLATORY INSTABILITIES 145\nNote that there cannot be any gap solitons for |\u2126| > 1 as then there is no gap in the linear\nspectrum. At the upper edge of the gap, at \u03b8 \u2192 0 (\u2126 \u2192 1), the solutions approach the\nsmall-amplitude nonlinear Schro\u00a8dinger soliton W (X) = \u03b8sech(\u03b8(X \u2212 i\/2)). At the lower\nedge, at \u03b8 \u2192 \u03c0 (\u2126 \u2192 \u22121), the gap soliton has a \ufb01nite amplitude and decays algebraically:\nW (X) = i\/(X + i\/2). These two limits are referred to as \u201clow intensity\u201d and \u201chigh intensity\u201d\nlimits, respectively [11].\n2.2. The linearized problem. To study the stability of the solution (2.5), we linearize\naround this solution in the moving frame and use a spectral Ansatz\nZ(X,T ) =\n(\nZ\u0302(X) + u(X)e\u03bbT\n)\n.\nWe obtain the dynamical system\nuX = A(X,\u03bb)u , u \u2208 C4 ,(2.6)\nwith\nA(X,\u03bb) = K\u22121[E\u22121D2S(Z\u02c6) + \u2126D2P (Z\u02c6)\u2212 \u03d5XD2Q(Z\u02c6)\u2212 \u03bbM],(2.7)\nwhere D2 denotes the Hessian.\n2.3. Asymptotic properties of the linearized system. As described in the introduction,\nthe eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the asymptotic matrix A\u221e(\u03bb) = limx\u2192\u00b1\u221eA(x, \u03bb) are\ncrucial for the numerical Evans function approach. The matrix A(x, \u03bb) has the asymptotic\nproperty that\nA\u221e(\u03bb) = lim\nx\u2192\u00b1\u221eA(x, \u03bb) =\n\u239b\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u2212\u03bb 0 \u2212\u2126 \u2212ey\n0 \u03bb e\u2212y \u2126\n\u2126 ey \u2212\u03bb 0\n\u2212e\u2212y \u2212\u2126 0 \u03bb\n\u239e\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 .(2.8)\nThe characteristic polynomial of A\u221e(\u03bb) is\n\u2206(\u00b5, \u03bb) = det[\u00b5I\u2212A\u221e(\u03bb)] = (\u00b52 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u2212 1 + \u21262)2 + 4\u21262\u03bb2 .(2.9)\nThus the eigenvalues \u00b5 of the asymptotic matrix satisfy\n\u00b52 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u2212 1 + \u21262 = \u00b12i\u2126\u03bb or \u00b52 = 1 + (\u03bb\u00b1 i\u2126)2 .(2.10)\nThe continuous spectrum is found by setting R(\u00b5) = 0 or \u00b5 = ik. A short calculation\ngives that there are four branches of continuous spectrum on the imaginary \u03bb-axis:\n\u03bb\u00b1(k) = i(\n\u221a\n1 + k2 \u00b1 |\u2126|) and \u2212 \u03bb\u00b1(k), k \u2208 R .\nThe endpoints of the continuous spectrum are at \u00b1i(1 \u2212 |\u2126|) and \u00b1i(1 + |\u2126|). For all values\nof \u03bb not in the continuous spectrum, there are two eigenvalues \u00b5 with positive real part and\n146 G. DERKS AND G. A. GOTTWALD\ntwo eigenvalues \u00b5 with negative real part. Thus outside the continuous spectrum, there is a\n2 : 2 splitting; that is, the dimension of the stable\/unstable manifolds is 2 at both limits of\nx = \u00b1\u221e.\nWith (2.10), it is easy to determine explicit expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvec-\ntors. The eigenvalues are\n\u00b5\u00b1m(\u03bb) = \u00b1\n\u221a\n(\u03bb\u2212 i|\u2126|)2 + 1 = \u00b1\u221a\u03bb\u2212 i(|\u2126|+ 1)\u221a\u03bb\u2212 i(|\u2126| \u2212 1),\n\u00b5\u00b1p (\u03bb) = \u00b1\n\u221a\n(\u03bb+ i|\u2126|)2 + 1 = \u00b1\u221a\u03bb+ i(|\u2126|+ 1)\u221a\u03bb+ i(|\u2126| \u2212 1),\nwhere the square roots are de\ufb01ned as follows:\n\u221a\nz =\n\u221a\n|z| ei arg(z)\/2, where \u2212 \u03c0 < arg(z) \u2264 \u03c0 and z = \u03bb\u00b1 i(|\u2126| \u00b1 1).\nHence the cuts in the complex plane, associated with this de\ufb01nition of the square roots, start\nat the endpoints of the continuous spectrum and continue in the left half of the complex\n\u03bb-plane. Note that this de\ufb01nition implies that all square roots have positive real parts.\nIn this model system it is easy to \ufb01nd explicit expressions for the eigenvectors. The\neigenvector with the eigenvalue \u00b5\u00b1i for the matrix A\u221e(\u03bb) is given by\nvec\u00b1m(\u03bb) = (F\u00b1m , sgn(\u2126)ie\u2212y,\u2212sgn(\u2126)iF\u00b1m , e\u2212y)T , where F\u00b1m = \u03bb\u2212 \u00b5\u00b1m \u2212 i|\u2126|,\nvec\u00b1p (\u03bb) = (F\u00b1p ,\u2212sgn(\u2126)ie\u2212y, sgn(\u2126)iF\u00b1p , e\u2212y)T , where F\u00b1p = \u03bb\u2212 \u00b5\u00b1p + i|\u2126|.\nThe eigenvector with the eigenvalue \u00b5\u00b1i for the adjoint matrix (A\u221e(\u03bb))\nT is given by\nadvec\u00b1m(\u03bb) = (F\n\u00b1\nm , sgn(\u2126)iey,\u2212sgn(\u2126)iF\u00b1m , ey)T , where F\u00b1m = \u03bb\u2212 \u00b5\u00b1m \u2212 i|\u2126|,\nadvec\u00b1p (\u03bb) = (F\n\u00b1\np ,\u2212sgn(\u2126)iey, sgn(\u2126)iF\u00b1p , ey)T , where F\u00b1p = \u03bb\u2212 \u00b5\u00b1p + i|\u2126|.\nOne might also use a numerical routine to solve the eigenvalue problem of A\u221e(\u03bb). How-\never, one has to be very careful near the endpoints of the continuous spectrum. At these points\ntwo eigenvalues collide; hence it will be tricky to \ufb01nd numerically the \u201ccorrect\u201d eigenvalue.\nIf we fail to do so, this will result in a change of orientation in the Evans function (2.14).\nThis causes unwanted zeros of the Evans function and is reminiscent of the unstable spurious\neigenvalues observed when the system (2.6) is solved by some form of discretization as done\nby Barashenkov and Zemlyanaya [5]. One can construct a numerical routine to follow the\ncorrect eigenfunction, but if the analytical expressions are readily available (as they are here),\nit is much easier.\n2.4. The Evans function and the formulation in the exterior algebra. For \u0005(\u03bb) > 0,\nthe system (2.6) and the properties of the system at in\ufb01nity, A\u221e(\u03bb), are in standard form\nfor the dynamical systems formulation of the spectral problem proposed by Evans [12] and\ngeneralized by Alexander, Gardner, and Jones [2]. A value of \u03bb \u2208 \u039b is an eigenvalue if the\ntwo-dimensional space of solutions which decays as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e and the (4 \u2212 2)-dimensional\nspace of solutions which do not grow exponentially as x\u2192 +\u221e have a nontrivial intersection.\nTHE EVANS FUNCTION AND OSCILLATORY INSTABILITIES 147\nThe Evans function is an analytic function which gives a zero if such a nontrivial intersection\nexists. To obtain an analytic description of the two-dimensional space of solutions of (2.6)\nwhich do not grow exponentially as x \u2192 +\u221e, we will use that the system (2.6) induces a\ndynamical system on the wedge-space\n\u22272(C4). This is a space of dimension (42) = 6. To de\ufb01ne\nthe Evans function, the induced dynamics on this wedge-space\n\u22272(C4) will be used.\nThe induced system can be written as\nUx = A\n(2)(x)U, U \u2208 \u22272(C4).(2.11)\nHere the linear operator (matrix) A(2) is de\ufb01ned on a decomposable 2-form u1 \u2227u2, ui \u2208 C 4,\nas\nA(2)(u1 \u2227 u2) := (Au1) \u2227 u2 + u1 \u2227 (Au2),(2.12)\nand it extends by linearity to the nondecomposable elements in\n\u22272(C4). This construction\ncan be carried out in a coordinate-free way and can be generalized to (k):(n\u2212 k) splittings in\nn-dimensional dynamical systems. General aspects of the numerical implementation of this\ntheory can be found in Allen and Bridges [3].\nSince the induced matrix A(2)(x, \u03bb) inherits the di\ufb00erentiability and analyticity of A(x, \u03bb),\nthe limiting matrices will exist:\nA(2)\u221e (\u03bb) = limx\u2192\u00b1\u221eA\n(2)(x, \u03bb) .\nThe set of eigenvalues of the matrix A\n(2)\n\u221e (\u03bb) consists of all possible sums of two eigenvalues of\nA\u221e(\u03bb) (this is an exercise in multilinear algebra; see Marcus [21]). Therefore, for \u0005(\u03bb) > 0,\nthere is an eigenvalue of A\n(2)\n\u221e (\u03bb), denoted by \u03c3+(\u03bb), which is the sum of the two eigenvalues\nof A\u221e(\u03bb) with negative real part; i.e., \u03c3+(\u03bb) = \u2212(\u00b5+m(\u03bb) + \u00b5+p (\u03bb)) (note that the subscript\n\u201c+\u201d in \u03c3+(\u03bb) refers to exponentially decaying behavior at +\u221e). Moreover, this eigenvalue is\nsimple, is an analytic function of \u03bb, and has real part strictly less than any other eigenvalue\nof A\n(k)\n\u221e (\u03bb). Similarly, there is an eigenvalue \u03c3\u2212(\u03bb), which is the sum of the two eigenvalues of\nA\u221e(\u03bb) with nonnegative real part; i.e., \u03c3\u2212(\u03bb) = \u00b5+m(\u03bb) + \u00b5+p (\u03bb), and \u03c3\u2212(\u03bb) is simple, is an\nanalytic function of \u03bb, and has real part strictly greater than any other eigenvalue of A\n(2)\n\u221e (\u03bb).\nNote that \u03c3\u2212(\u03bb) = \u2212\u03c3+(\u03bb) in this example.\nLet \u03b6\u00b1(\u03bb) be the eigenvectors associated with \u03c3\u00b1(\u03bb), de\ufb01ned by\nA(2)\u221e (\u03bb)\u03b6\n+(\u03bb) = \u03c3+(\u03bb)\u03b6\n+(\u03bb) and A(2)\u221e (\u03bb)\u03b6\n\u2212(\u03bb) = \u03c3\u2212(\u03bb)\u03b6\u2212(\u03bb) .(2.13)\nThese vectors can always be constructed in an analytic way (see [10]). From section 2.3, it\nfollows that\n\u03b6\u00b1(\u03bb) = vec\u2213m(\u03bb) \u2227 vec\u2213p (\u03bb).\nThis implies\n\u03b6\u2213 =\n(\nF\u00b1p + F\n\u00b1\nm ,\u22122eyF\u00b1p F\u00b1m , sgn(\u2126)i(F\u00b1m \u2212 F\u00b1p ), sgn(\u2126)i(F\u00b1m \u2212 F\u00b1p ),\u22122e\u2212y, F\u00b1p + F\u00b1m\n)T\n.\n148 G. DERKS AND G. A. GOTTWALD\nThe solution U\u00b1(x, \u03bb) is the solution of the linearized system (2.11) with the property that\nlimx\u2192\u00b1\u221e e\u2212\u03c3\u00b1(\u03bb)xU\u00b1(x, \u03bb) = \u03b6\u00b1(\u03bb). In this example, the dimensions of the unstable mani-\nfolds at x =\u221e and x = \u2212\u221e are the same. For the construction of the general case, see [3, 10].\nNote that the solutions U\u00b1(x, \u03bb) are analytic expressions which represent the space of\nsolutions which decay as x\u2192 \u00b1\u221e in the original system (2.6). With this the Evans function\ncan be de\ufb01ned as\nE(\u03bb) = e\u2212\n\u222b x\n0 \u03c4(s,\u03bb)ds U\u2212(x, \u03bb) \u2227U+(x, \u03bb) , \u03bb \u2208 \u039b ,(2.14)\nwhere \u2227 is the wedge product and\n\u03c4(x, \u03bb) = Tr(A(x, \u03bb)) .(2.15)\nFor the case of the coupled mode equation (1.2) this expression simpli\ufb01es, since Tr(A(x, \u03bb)) =\n0; see (2.7). The Evans function, as de\ufb01ned above, can be extended across the continuous\nspectrum with some cuts in the complex plane; see Gardner and Zumbrun [13] and Kapitula\nand Sandstede [14].\nNext we will give an equivalent description of the Evans function, using the adjoint system.\nThe adjoint system of (2.11) is\nVx = \u2212[A(2)(x)]\nT\nV .(2.16)\nThe dimension of the unstable manifold of this adjoint system is equal to the dimension of\nthe stable manifold of the linearized system (2.11) and its most unstable eigenvalue is \u2212\u03c3+.\nUsing the Hodge-star operator, we can relate the most unstable solution V\u2212 at x = \u2212\u221e of\nthe adjoint system with the most unstable solution U\u2212 of the linearized system at x = \u2212\u221e.\nDetails can be found in [3, 6, 10]. To formulate the alternative description of the Evans\nfunction, we have to construct an inner product on\n\u22272(C4). Let\nU = u1 \u2227 u2 and V = v1 \u2227 v2 , ui,vj \u2208 C 4 \u2200 i, j = 1, 2\nbe any decomposable 2-forms. The inner product of U and V is de\ufb01ned by\n[[U,V]]2 := det\n\u23a1\u23a3\u3008u1,v1\u3009 \u3008u1,v2\u3009\n\u3008u2,v1\u3009 \u3008u2,v2\u3009\n\u23a4\u23a6 ,\nwhere \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009 is the complex inner product in C 4. Since every element in \u22272(C4) is a sum\nof decomposable elements, this de\ufb01nition extends by linearity to any 2-form in\n\u22272(C4). An\nequivalent de\ufb01nition of the Evans function (2.14) is given by the readily computable expression\nE(\u03bb) = [[V\u2212(0, \u03bb),U+(0, \u03bb)]]2 ,(2.17)\nwhere V\u2212(x, \u03bb) is the most unstable solution at x = \u2212\u221e of the adjoint system (2.16). From\nsection 2.3, it follows that the eigenvector of the adjoint matrix \u2212(A(2))T for the eigenvalue\n\u2212\u03c3+ = \u00b5+p + \u00b5+m is\n\u03b7\u2212 =\n(\nF+p + F\n+\nm ,\u22122eyF+p F+m , sgn(\u2126)i(F+m \u2212 F+p ), sgn(\u2126)i(F+m \u2212 F+p ),\u22122e\u2212y, F+p + F+m\n)T\n.\nTHE EVANS FUNCTION AND OSCILLATORY INSTABILITIES 149\nHence the solution V\u2212(x, \u03bb) is the solution of the adjoint linearized system (2.16) with the\nasymptotic behavior limx\u2192\u2212\u221e e\u03c3+(\u03bb)xV\u2212(x, \u03bb) = \u03b7\u2212(\u03bb). The generalization of this de\ufb01nition\nfor general splittings and more details can be found in [6, 10].\nFor the numerical implementation, we will need a basis for\n\u22272(C4), and the above con-\nstruction ensures that any basis will do. Therefore, there is no loss of generality in assuming\nthat the bases chosen are the standard ones. Starting with the standard basis for C4, and\nvolume form V = e1 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 e4, let a1, . . . ,a6 be the induced orthonormal basis on\n\u22272(C4).\nUsing a standard lexical ordering, this basis can be taken to be\na1 = e1 \u2227 e2, a2 = e1 \u2227 e3, a3 = e1 \u2227 e4,\na4 = e2 \u2227 e3, a5 = e2 \u2227 e4, a6 = e3 \u2227 e4.\n(2.18)\nAny U \u2208 \u22272(C4) can be expressed as U = \u22116j=1 Ujaj . Since the basis elements ai are\northogonal and the inner product [[\u00b7, \u00b7]]2 on\n\u22272(C4) is equivalent to the inner product \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u30096 on\nC\n6, the expression (2.17) for the Evans function can be expressed in the equivalent form\nE(\u03bb) = \u3008V\u2212(0, \u03bb),U+(0, \u03bb)\u30096 .(2.19)\nIt is this form of the Evans function that we implement in our numerical algorithm.\nThe matrix A(2) :\n\u22272(C4)\u2192 \u22272(C4) can be associated with a complex 6\u00d7 6 matrix with\nentries\n{A(2)}i,j = [[ai,A(2)aj ]]2 , i, j = 1, . . . , 6 ,(2.20)\nwhere, for any decomposable U = u1 \u2227 u2 \u2208\n\u22272(C4), A(2)U := Au1 \u2227 u2 + u1 \u2227Au2. Let\nA be an arbitrary 4\u00d7 4 matrix with complex entries aij , i, j = 1, . . . , 4; then, with respect to\nthe basis (2.18), A(2) takes the explicit form\nA(2) =\n\u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\na11+a22 a23 a24 \u2212a13 \u2212a14 0\na32 a11+a33 a34 a12 0 \u2212a14\na42 a43 a11+a44 0 a12 a13\n\u2212a31 a21 0 a22+a33 a34 \u2212a24\n\u2212a41 0 a21 a43 a22+a44 a23\n0 \u2212a41 a31 \u2212a42 a32 a33+a44\n\u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\n.\nDetails for these constructions in more general systems can be found in [3].\n2.5. Integration scheme. The subtle nature of the oscillatory instability requires a high\norder integration scheme for the numerical integration of the linearized and the adjoint sys-\ntems. Instead of using the second order Gauss\u2013Legendre Runge\u2013Kutta method, i.e., the\nimplicit midpoint rule, as in Bridges, Derks, and Gottwald [10], we employ here a fourth order\nGauss\u2013Legendre scheme.

As explained in section 2.4, it\nis su\ufb03cient to restrict the shooting algorithm to\n\u22272(C4). As a starting vector for the shooting\nalgorithm we use the eigenvectors of A\n(2)\n\u221e (\u03bb) in the far \ufb01eld (see sections 2.3 and 2.4). For the\nintegration of the linearized system starting at x = +L\u221e (with L\u221e \u0002 1), the starting vectors\nfor each \u03bb are the eigenvectors \u03b6+(\u03bb) related to the eigenvalues with the largest negative real\npart; for the integration of the adjoint system starting at x = \u2212L\u221e, the starting vectors are\nthe eigenvectors \u03b7\u2212(\u03bb) related to the eigenvalues with the largest positive real part. We have\nbuilt in an analytical normalization process such that the eigenvectors are normalized so that\n\u3008\u03b7\u2212(\u03bb), \u03b6+(\u03bb)\u30096 = 1 for large values of \u03bb.

An alternative to this scaling is to impose a renormalization of\nthe vectors during or at the end of the integration, with, for example, |U\u02dc+(0, \u03bb)| = 1, but\nsuch a scaling does not preserve analyticity.\nFor x < 0, the adjoint equation\nd\ndx\nV\u02dc\u2212 =\n[\n\u2212A(2)(x, \u03bb)T + \u03c3+(\u03bb)Id\n]\nV\u02dc\u2212 , V\u02dc\u2212(x, \u03bb)\n\u2223\u2223\nx=\u2212L\u221e = \u03b7\n\u2212(\u03bb)(2.25)\nis integrated from x = \u2212L\u221e to x = 0, also using the implicit midpoint rule, where again we\nintroduce a rescaling\nV\u02dc\u2212(x, \u03bb) = e\u03c3+(\u03bb)x V\u2212(x, \u03bb)(2.26)\nto remove the exponential growth.\nAt x = 0, the computed Evans function is\nE(\u03bb) = \u3008V\u2212(0, \u03bb),U+(0, \u03bb)\u30096 = \u3008V\u02dc\u2212(0, \u03bb), U\u02dc+(0, \u03bb)\u30096 .(2.27)\nTHE EVANS FUNCTION AND OSCILLATORY INSTABILITIES 151\n3.

In Figure 1, we have sketched a cartoon which indicates where in parameter space,\ni.e., in the \u03b8-\u03c1-plane, the numerical analysis takes place. This cartoon is a guidance to help\nto locate the upcoming plethora of \ufb01gures and how these \ufb01gures are related to bifurcations\nand instabilities.\n0.4 0.5 0.6 0.8\u03c0 \u03c0 \u03c0 \u03c0\nFig. 2\nFig. 3 Fig. 5\nFig. 6\n0.1\nFig. 7\n\u03b8\nsecondary bifurcation\n\u03c1\nFig. 8\nFig. 4\nprimary bifurcations\nFigure 1. Cartoon to illustrate where in parameter space the numerical analysis takes place.\nWe study instability by computing the Evans function E(\u03bb) as de\ufb01ned in (2.19). The\nanalyticity of the Evans function for \u0005(\u03bb) > 0 allows one to detect oscillatory instabilities, i.e.,\ncomplex roots of the Evans function, by means of Cauchy\u2019s theorem. The winding number\nof a closed curve in the \u03bb-plane tells us about the number of unstable eigenvalues. In all\nour calculations, we compute the complex Evans function E(\u03bb) while varying the spectral\nparameter \u03bb = i\u03bb\u02dc on the imaginary axis or varying the spectral parameter parallel to the\nimaginary axis with a (small) o\ufb00set, explicitly \u03bb = o\ufb00 + i\u03bb\u02dc, where \u201co\ufb00 \u201d is the o\ufb00set. The\nnormalization of the Evans function is chosen such that the Evans function converges to 1 for\n\u03bb large. Hence the closed curve is formed by connecting the endpoints of the imaginary axis\nvia the half circle with in\ufb01nite radius. On this half circle, the Evans function will always have\nthe value 1.\nSince the system (1.2) has translational and rotational symmetry, the Evans function will\nhave a fourth order zero at \u03bb = 0. This means that in the vicinity of \u03bb = 0, the Evans function\nscales as E(\u03bb) \u223c \u03bb4. Hence even an o\ufb00set of only 10\u22124 yields that E(\u03bb) is of the order of\n10\u221216, making the calculations meaningless. In order to avoid this problem, we use an o\ufb00set\nof at least 5 \u00b7 10\u22123 to analyze the Evans function near \u03bb = 0. Since we are interested here in\noscillatory instabilities which occur at the edges of or within the continuous spectrum, and\nnot in translational instabilities where eigenvalues emanate from \u03bb = 0, the o\ufb00set near the\n\u03bb = 0 does not a\ufb00ect the detection of instabilities.\nIn the integrable case (\u03c1 = 0), the linearized massive Thirring model (1.2) has only neutral\n152 G.

The inset is a blow-up of the Evans function and shows the discrete eigenvalue where\nE(\u03bb) = 0. The endpoints of the continuous spectrum occur at the cusps of the Evans function.\nand continuous eigenvalues [16, 17], and the solitary wave is stable for any 0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0. The\nEvans function has zeros at the endpoints of the branches of continuous spectrum if \u03c1 = 0.\nIn Figure 2 (left), we used our algorithm to calculate the Evans function for \u03c1 = 0, while\nthe spectral parameter \u03bb is on the imaginary axis (o\ufb00 = 0). This illustrates the zeros of the\nEvans function at the endpoints of the branches of the continuous spectrum. As follows from\nsection 2.3, the edges of the continuous spectrum are located at \u03bb+ = i(|\u2126|+1) (upper branch)\nand at \u03bb\u2212 = i(1\u2212 |\u2126|) (lower branch). At these endpoints, the real or the imaginary part of\nthe Evans function exibits a cusp, as can be seen in Figure 2 (left). These cusps illustrate the\nnonanalyticity of the Evans function at those points. Note that the cusps and the associated\nnonanalyticity of the Evans function at the endpoints of the continuous spectrum occur for\nall \u03c1 > 0 and all 0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0, as can be seen from the following \ufb01gures.\nFor 0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0\/2 and \u03c1 > 0, the linearized perturbed massive Thirring model (1.2)\nhas a discrete eigenvalue, which is located on the imaginary axis in the gap between the\nbranches of continuous spectrum; see results in [4, 15]. This eigenvalue has bifurcated at\n\u03c1 = 0 from the lower endpoint (\u03bb\u2212) of the continuous spectrum. Our algorithm can follow\nthis discrete eigenvalue on the imaginary axis, as illustrated in Figure 2 (right). The edges\nof the two continuous branches corresponding to positive and negative energy states in the\nmassive Thirring model (1.2) are located on the imaginary axis at \u03bb+ = i(|\u2126| + 1) (upper\nbranch) and at \u03bb\u2212 = i(1\u2212 |\u2126|) (lower branch) (see section 2.3). Here the discrete eigenvalue\nwhich lies on the imaginary axis is clearly below the edge of the lower branch (\u03bb\u2212) of the\ncontinuous spectrum. In the gap between the branches of continuous spectrum, the Evans\nfunction is still analytic, since there is still a 2:2 split of the dimensions of the stable and\nunstable manifolds.\nFor 0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0\/2, the solitary waves are known to be stable even for nonzero \u03c1 [4, 15]. In\nFigure 3 we show the Evans function for such a stable case. To determine the winding number,\nwe need to zoom into the neighborhood of E = 0.

Hence the winding number is zero, con\ufb01rming\nstability,\nFor \u03c0\/2 < \u03b8 < \u03c0, instabilities may arise for nonzero \u03c1. These instabilities are of an\noscillatory nature in the sense that discrete eigenvalues leave the imaginary axis and enter\nthe complex plane [4, 15]. The onset of the \ufb01rst instability is when the discrete eigenvalue\nin the gap of the continuous spectrum merges with the edge of the lower branch (\u03bb\u2212) of the\ncontinuous spectrum. In the \u03b8-\u03c1 bifurcation plane, the instability curve starts at \u03c1 = 0 and\n\u03b8 = 0.5 initially proportional to\n\u221a\n\u03c1 [4, 15].\nIn Figure 4, the onset of the instability is illustrated at \u03c1 = 0.1 and V = 0.9. At the\nbifurcation point the eigenvalue detaches from the imaginary axis at the edge of the lower\nbranch (\u03bb\u2212) of the continuous spectrum and enters the complex plane. This can be explored\n154 G. DERKS AND G. A.

Right: The Evans\nfunction in Figure 5 (left) is topologically equivalent to this sketch of E(\u03bb). The winding number is clearly 2,\ncon\ufb01rming that there is one pair of unstable eigenvalues for these parameter values.\nby looking at the winding number of the Evans function. Figure 5 shows the real and imaginary\nparts of the Evans function where the instability has occurred and the two unstable eigenvalues\nhave moved away from the imaginary axis (at \u03c1 = 0.1, V = 0.9, and \u03b8 = 0.6\u03c0). The winding\nnumber is 2, con\ufb01rming that a pair of unstable eigenvalues is present.\nIf we now decrease \u03c1 (with \u03b8 \ufb01xed) from the above described primary bifurcation of\noscillatory instability, the primary unstable eigenvalue will merge with the edge of the upper\nbranch (\u03bb+) of the continuous spectrum. This is illustrated in Figure 6. If \u03c1 is decreased\nbelow this bifurcation, the solitary wave is stable again. We see clearly the collision of the\neigenvalue with the edge of the upper branch (\u03bb+) of the continuous spectrum. In [15], a\nslightly di\ufb00erent perturbation is studied, and it is proved analytically that in this case two\nbifurcation curves originate from (\u03b8, \u03c1) = (0.5\u03c0, 0). However, it is not clear what the relation\nwith the branches of continuous spectrum is away from the bifurcation point. Our calculations\nsuggest that for our perturbation there are again two bifurcation curves; one curve is related\nTHE EVANS FUNCTION AND OSCILLATORY INSTABILITIES 155\n\u03bb\u223c\n-0.2\n-0.15\n-0.1\n-0.05\n 0\n 0.05\n 0.1\n 0.15\n 0.2\n 0.25\n 1.307  1.3075  1.308  1.3085  1.309  1.3095  1.31\n\u03bb\u223c\n-0.2\n-0.15\n-0.1\n-0.05\n 0\n 0.05\n 0.1\n 0.15\n 0.2\n 0.25\n 1.307  1.3075  1.308  1.3085  1.309  1.3095  1.31\nFigure 6.

By looking at the real and imaginary\npart of the Evans function, the value of lambda which corresponds to a root of the Evans\nfunction can be located. This allowed us to answer the question from where on the imaginary\naxis the eigenvalues detach for the primary instability.\nIt has been found analytically in [4] that secondary bifurcations can occur for suitable\nvalues of \u03c1 and \u03b8 (we assume V is \ufb01xed here for simplicity). Here a second pair of eigenvalues\ndetach from the continuous spectrum into the complex plane. Again, analyticity of the Evans\nfunction allows us to compute the number of unstable eigenvalues by determining the winding\n156 G. DERKS AND G. A.

In Figure 7 we show that the winding number equals 4 when \u03c1 = 0.1, V = 0.9, and\n\u03b8 = 0.9\u03c0, indicating that a new pair of eigenvalues have detached. The behavior near \u03bb = 0\nclose to the origin of the Evans function is similar to that depicted in Figure 3 (bottom center).\nThe onset of this secondary instability at \u03c1 = 0.1 and V = 0.9 is shown in Figure 8. Figure 8\nshows the behavior of the Evans function shortly before, at, and shortly after the secondary\ninstability. In order to see the secondary instability and the emergence of the eigenvalue, one\nneeds to look at the behavior near E = 0. Note that the secondary instability is hard to\nobserve in the full Evans function (left pictures in Figure 8). In the middle picture, the Evans\nfunction has a zero, just after the edge of the upper branch (\u03bb+) of the continuous spectrum,\nbut not at the edge of this branch. Hence for \u03c1 > 0, the eigenvalue really comes from within\nthe continuous spectrum and not out of one of the endpoints of the branches of the continuous\nspectrum. Similar behavior has been described by Sandstede and Scheel [23].\nThe results in this section show that our algorithm using the Evans function approach\nexercised on the wedge space provides a good and reliable diagnostic tool for the accurate\ndetection of oscillatory instabilities. The analyticity of the Evans function allows for detection\nof complex eigenvalues by ensuring the necessary conditions for the application of Cauchy\u2019s\nprinciple. Our algorithm is able to follow the location of the discrete eigenvalues in the\ncourse of their bifurcations. The Evans function does not involve a discretization of the\nspectrum of the eigenvalue problem and hence does not fracture the continuous spectrum. It is\ntherefore free of spurious unstable eigenvalues. Moreover, the exterior algebra is a platform for\nnumerically stable shooting. As already stated, the method is not restricted to the particular\ncoupled mode model (1.2) but can be applied to other problems as well.\nAcknowledgments.
