V. Loudon \nBritish Geological Survey, West Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3LA, U.K. \ne-mail: v.loudon@bgs.ac.uk \n \n \nPostprint of article in Computers & Geosciences, 26 (3A) April 2000, pp. A131-A132 \n \nLike a canal navigator watching an iron horse steam by, like a railroad engineer \nsighting a horseless carriage, the geologist viewing images on a computer screen is \nwitness to a paradigm shift. Unrecognized assumptions lose their validity, and things \nwill never be the same again. \n \nThe electronic tools now fashioning the geoscience knowledge base open a door to \nthe unknown. We can explore it only by trial and error, past experience our only \nguide. And so we rely on metaphor, just as Hamlet, struggling with a binary decision \non whether to be (or not), took refuge in a stream of metaphors \u2013 slings, arrows, sea, \nsleep, dreams, rub, coil \u2013 desperate to throw light from familiar concepts on a \nscenario he could not fully grasp. \n \nScientists, like poets and prophets, are accustomed to metaphor, and for the same \nreason. As individuals, microcosms of the universe, they seek to explore the larger \nwhole. If a fragment of a hologram can reproduce a full image, albeit with loss of \nresolution, perhaps the lesser can know (imperfectly) the greater, through insights \nstemming from considered experience. The information technologist uses explicit \nmetaphors \u2013 think of the screen as a desktop, the rectangular area as a window. The \nscientist more often formalizes the metaphor as a model, and harnesses the power of \nmathematics. \n \nWorking geologists give little thought to their global metaphor or world view. They \nmight accept that on the one hand is the real world, existing quite independently of \ntheir science. On the other hand is a geoscience knowledge base, the shareable record \nof observations and ideas from unnumbered contributors, representing selected \naspects of that real world. Moving between them are scientists, now observing or \ntesting hypotheses in the real world, now studying or adding to the knowledge base, \ncarrying in their minds additional ideas, too tentative, ephemeral or complex to add to \nthe formal record, but maybe shared in part among their workgroup.   \n \nInformation technology is shaping and transforming not the real world but the \nShadowlands of the knowledge base: no longer remote, but all pervasive. The \nlandscape, the rocky outcrop, the hammer blow, the shattered specimen, can be shared \nas a visual record, available, on the instant, in Patagonia, in Perth, in Pocatello, Idaho. \nThe network of scientific reasoning, the web of discourse painstakingly assembled \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part M(4)  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, \n26(3A)) \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part M(4)  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, \n26(3A)) \n \nover so many decades, is electrified. It is traversed by electronic agents, unhampered \nby boundaries of discipline or place, retrieving and delivering data to the desktop - the \nfruits of a multitude of endeavors, filtered for relevance, displayed for easy \nvisualization, formatted for local manipulation and integration.   \n \nUnfamiliar metaphors and models thrive in a rebuilt knowledge base, forcing change \nto investigational design. Broad views across global information are supported by \npowerful analytical software. The players of the information industry \u2013 the students, \nprofessors, surveyors, consultants, authors, editors, referees, cartographers, \npublishers, librarians, booksellers, archivists, curators, customers and readers \u2013 \nassume new roles within changed business groupings. Earth scientists, like all makers \nof maps and suppliers of information, must review their methods and rationale. \n \nBut look away from the screen, step outside the door, and little is altered. The \ngeoscience community is split. For most, there has been no revolution, the case for \nchange has still to be made. Those captivated by new technology have set their own \nagenda, and largely been ignored by the traditional practitioners who take for granted \ntheir pens, paper and printing press.  \n \nIncreasingly, these tools are being displaced by their electronic successors as new \ntechnologies intertwine with the knowledge base. The vision developed here has a \nmyriad of structures, the object-integration platforms of individual geoscientists, \nmetaphorically floating above the real world through the objects and models defining \ncyberspace. Controlled from the desktop, the platforms change content as they roam, \nand level of detail as they rise and fall. Structured by metadata and based on a shared \nparadigm, each supports its user\u2019s view. Objects are assembled to interact with the \nuser\u2019s knowledge and with skills honed by evolution in the human brain. It is a place \nfor scientists to explore ideas and embody their findings in new objects \u2013 discussed, \nevaluated, and launched in cyberspace \u2013 where through variation, selection and \nheredity, ideas evolve and the favored survive. \n \n \n \n \n \nDisclaimer: The views expressed by the author are not necessarily those of the British \nGeological Survey or any other organization.
