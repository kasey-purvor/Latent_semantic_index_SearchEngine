The\nunderlying cause in more than 90% of patients is a benign\nadenoma of the GH-secreting cells of the anterior pitui-\ntary. Very rarely acromegaly is due to hypothalamic over\nsecretion of growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH)\nor to extra-pituitary tumours that secrete GH or GHRH.\nGH promotes insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) secre-\ntion. Prolonged exposure to elevated endogenous levels of\nGH and\/or IGF-1 in acromegaly results in excessive\nsomatic growth and metabolic dysfunction leading to\nboth direct and indirect tissue damage, secondary sys-\ntemic illness and reduced life expectancy. Extended dis-\ncussion of the systemic complications can be found in\nColao et al 2004 [3], Melmed 2006 [1] and Chanson and\nSalenave[2]\nThe insidious development of symptoms and their variety\ncontribute to delayed diagnosis of about 8 years from\nonset of first symptoms [4]. Biochemical diagnosis is\nmade by immunoassay of GH and of IGF-1 in blood [1].\nTraditionally excess secretion of GH has been targeted by\ntreatment strategies to reduce secretion; employing sur-\ngery, radiotherapy, dopamine agonists (DOPAs), and\/or\nsomatostatin agonists (SSAs) alone or as adjuvant to sur-\ngery. Recently Pegvisomant (Somavert\u00ae; Pfizer) was devel-\noped with the aim of blocking the action of circulating\nGH. Pegvisomant (PEG) is a genetically engineered ana-\nlogue of human GH that can compete with endogenous\nGH for GH receptors while failing to activate the receptor.\nAs the effectiveness of PEG depends on competition with\nGH the required dose is influenced by endogenous GH\nlevels which depend on the size, activity and type of ade-\nnoma. PEG is administered daily by subcutaneous injec-\ntion. In Europe, PEG is licensed for patients who have had\nan inadequate response to surgery and\/or radiation and in\nwhom an appropriate medical treatment with somatosta-\ntin analogues did not normalise IGF-1 concentrations or\nwas not tolerated[5].\nHere we present a systematic review of the evidence about\nthe clinical effectiveness of PEG and an economic analysis\nto estimate the cost-effectiveness of PEG treatment relative\nto standard care.\nMethods\nThe review was conducted according to a predefined pro-\ntocol (available on request).\nSearch strategy clinical effectiveness\nThe following bibliographic databases and other sources\nwere searched for studies of clinical effectiveness: (i) Bib-\nliographic databases: Cochrane Library (Wiley),\nMEDLINE (Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid) In-Process, EMBASE\n(Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO). (ii) Sources of information on\nongoing and unpublished research (including the\nNational Research Register and ClinicalTrials). (iii)\nSources of Abstracts and Proceedings (ZETOC, ENDO\n2006 Endocrine Society's 88th annual meeting). (iv) Cita-\ntions of relevant studies. (v) Experts in the field were con-\ntacted to check that no published or unpublished studies\nhad been missed. (vi) Studies listed in systematic and\nother reviews. The following bibliographic databases were\nsearched for economic studies: MEDLINE(Ovid);\nEMBASE (Ovid); Cochrane Library (Wiley); NHS EED,\nOHE HEED. Electronic databases were searched up to\nMarch 2007. No language or date restrictions were\napplied. Full details are in Additional File 1.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria for clinical studies\nNo systematic reviews were identified. Primary studies of\neffectiveness were selected according the following crite-\nria: Study design: RCTs, quasi-randomised clinical trials,\ncomparative non-randomised studies, or case series if at\nleast 10 patients were included. Population: Patients diag-\nnosed with acromegaly. Intervention: Treatment with PEG.\nComparator(s): any other or no treatment. Outcomes: Any\nclinically relevant outcomes, changes in IGF-1 levels and\nGH levels. Economic studies were selected using the fol-\nlowing criteria: Study design: Cost-effectiveness, cost-utility\nand cost-benefit studies. Health economic reviews were\nalso included. Population: People with acromegaly. Inter-\nvention: PEG. Comparator: Any alternative treatment. Out-\ncomes: Quality of life, costs or incremental cost-\neffectiveness ratio. Conference and symposium abstracts\nwere noted and used to check for studies published as full\npapers.\nThe quality of included studies was assessed using stand-\nard check lists [6], and appropriate data were extracted\nfrom included studies by one reviewer and checked by a\nsecond. Application of inclusion criteria, quality assess-\nment and data extraction were undertaken by one\nreviewer and checked by a second. Disagreements were\nresolved by consensus.\nHeterogeneity of clinical studies precluded meta-analysis\nand clinical effectiveness was reviewed by narrative syn-\nthesis. Studies that were multiply published were checked\nand the most appropriate trial data extracted. Studies that\nreported health-related quality of life (QoL) results for\npatients with acromegaly but did not satisfy the inclusion\ncriteria were noted and if judged relevant were used to\ninform the economic analysis.\nResults\nNumber and type of studies identified\nThe electronic search yielded 319 citations (see Additional\nFile 2). After removal of duplicates and irrelevant citationsPage 2 of 15\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Endocrine Disorders 2009, 9:20 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6823\/9\/20on the basis of title and\/or abstract the full texts of 32 cita-\ntions were obtained for further scrutiny. On application of\ninclusion criteria 14 publications were excluded (see\nAdditional File 2 for reasons for exclusion). The main\ncharacteristics of the eighteen included publications are\nsummarised in Additional File 3 (further details are pro-\nvided in Additional File 4). The studies comprised one\nmulticentre RCT (Trainer 2000 [7]) of 112 patients ran-\ndomised to placebo or three different doses of PEG for 12\nweeks; an open label extension of this RCT (Van der Lely\n2001 [8]) with additional patients (total = 160) and\naltered dose regimen; two publications describing analy-\nses of patient subgroups from the RCT [9,10]; a retrospec-\ntive case series (n = 142) aimed at monitoring safety of\nPEG treatment (Biering 2006 [11]); and 13 before versus\nafter PEG treatment comparisons [12-24], one of which\n[12] was conducted retrospectively. Three of these publi-\ncations (Paisley 2006; [13] Parkinson 2004 and Parkinson\n2003 [14,15]) included a comparison with matched\nhealthy subjects in a cross sectional (i.e. single-time meas-\nure) design. In several instances the same patients were\ninvolved in more than one of the above studies.\nPopulations recruited\nPEG is licensed for patients with suboptimal response to\nother treatments or who are intolerant of medical treat-\nment required to normalise GH and IGF-1 levels. The RCT\n(Trainer 2000 [7]) was conducted prior to licensing. The\nstatus of patients relative to the licensed indication is not\nclear. One study, Colao 2006 [16], did recruit only\npatients that had not satisfactorily responded to other\ntreatments.\nDose regimens and duration of treatment\nIn most studies a large loading dose (40 to 80 mg) of PEG\nwas administered on day one. After the loading dose in\nthe RCT doses of 10, 15 or 20 mg\/day were given for 12\nweeks. In most other studies, after loading, 10 mg\/day was\nadministered but adjusted at timed intervals until serum\nIGF-1 levels had declined to within normal range or a\nmaximum dose (e.g. 30 or 40 mg\/day) was reached. The\ndose regimen was halted, suspended or reduced if serum\nliver enzymes rose to levels giving clinical concern. Three\nstudies [17-19] employed distinctly different dose regi-\nmens from other studies. In Jehle 2005 [17] (n = 10), after\nachieving IGF-1 normalisation, the interval between dos-\ning was first doubled (dose every other day) and then, if\nIGF-1 normalisation was retained, doubled again. If, after\ndose-frequency change, IGF-1 reverted to abnormal levels\nthen dose frequency was returned to the previously suc-\ncessful frequency. In Jorgensen 2005 [19] (n = 11) PEG\nwas compared to PEG combined with long-acting SSA. In\nFeenstra 2005 [18] PEG was administered weekly rather\nthan daily but was adjunct to monthly administration of\nlong-acting SSA treatment, and PEG dose was increased\nuntil IGF-1 normalisation was achieved.\nFollow-up of patients was short term in most studies.\nDuration of study treatment period varied from as little as\n12 weeks in many studies to 12 months in a few, or in the\nmore extended studies up to 2 years for a few patients\n[8,9,17,20,21] (Additional File 3).\nOutcomes reported\nSigns and symptoms of disease were monitored in the\nRCT and three other studies [7,16,17,21] using patient\nquestionnaires. Serum IGF-1 levels were almost univer-\nsally reported. GH levels were reported in the RCT and its\nextension [7,8] and a few small studies [9,16,19]. Several\nstudies focussed on risk factors for cardiovascular disease\n[13,16,20,22], and\/or for diabetes [17,19,20,23]. Two\nstudies focussed on markers of bone metabolism [10,15].\nSide effects and transaminases levels were commonly, but\nnot universally, reported. None of the studies assessed\nquality of life outcomes.\nRisk of bias in included studies\nWithdrawals from treatment in the RCT were fully\ndescribed and trial arms were balanced at baseline; the\npublication provided few details of randomisation, allo-\ncation concealment or blinding procedures. The greatest\nrisks for bias amongst the remaining studies (Table 1)\narose from a lack of clear information about the sampling\nframe from which study participants had been selected\nand a lack of description of the selection methods\nemployed. The rarity of acromegaly may have dictated the\nuse of convenience samples in most studies but this was\nnot explicitly reported.\nClinical effectiveness: signs and symptoms of acromegaly\nThe RCT [7] elicited patient information on signs and\nsymptoms using a questionnaire rating scale of 0 (no\nsymptoms) to 8 (severe, incapacitating) for each of five\nsymptom categories: soft tissue swelling, headache, joint\npain, excessive sweating, fatigue (Figure 1). At 12 weeks\nstatistically significant (p \u2264 0.05) improvements from\nbaseline were noted for the two high dose groups for soft\ntissue swelling and excessive perspiration, and for all three\nPEG groups for fatigue. No statistically significant changes\noccurred for the placebo group except for fatigue which\nworsened.\nThe small uncontrolled study of Jehle [17] (N = 10) noted\na trend for improvement over a mean treatment period of\n15.3 (\u00b1 4.6) months. Colao [16] reported a favourable\ntrend toward improvement from baseline for 10 patients;\nnone of the changes in the individual symptom category\nscores reached statistical significance.

In\nthis study 62 patients (of 229) completed the question-\nnaire at baseline and 56 at 6 months into treatment. The\nresults may be susceptible to sampling bias. Both the RCT\nand Jehle study reported statistically significant reduc-\ntions in finger-ring size that were attributed to PEG ther-\napy.\nClinical effectiveness: tumour volume\nIn the RCT PEG treatment did not alter the group mean\ntumour volumes relative to baseline and no individual\npatient exhibited a clinically significant increase in\ntumour volume [7]. In the RCT extension [8] (N = 131)\n160 MRI image pairs were collected, one image at baseline\nand another at an average of 11.5 months into treatment.\nNo statistically significant change from baseline was\nobserved in mean tumour volume. At baseline mean\ntumour volume was 2.41 ml (95% CI: 1.8 to 3.0) and after\ntreatment was 2.37 ml (95% CI: 1.8 to 3.0). The mean of\nindividual change from baseline was - 0.033 ml (95% CI:\n- 0.15 to + 0.08; p = 0.353 versus zero change). Two\npatients had progressive tumour growth requiring treat-\nment, the authors could attribute no cause, and there was\nno relationship between duration of treatment and\nchange in tumour size. Colao [16] reported a baseline\nmean tumour size of 1.23 ml (95% CI: 0.55 to 1.91) for\n14 patients; after treatment mean volume was 1.20 ml\n(95% CI; 0.46 to 1.95); the mean change in volume was -\n0.026 ml (95% CI; - 0.21 to + 1.56). Jehle [17] observed\nsmall clinically insignificant increases in tumour size in 2\nof 10 patients (duration of treatment 12 to 20 weeks).\nDual-therapy (PEG + SSA) studies [18,19] reported simi-\nlar results (statistically non-significant).\nClinical effectiveness: achievement of normal IGF-1 levels\nIn the RCT [7] IGF-1 normalisation was the primary out-\ncome. Baseline IGF-1 levels were at least 1.3 times above\nthe top of the normal range. Statistically significant reduc-\ntions in IGF-1 occurred after treatment in all three PEG\ngroups but not the placebo group (Figure 2); at all time\nintervals after baseline statistically significant differences\nChange in signs and symptoms of acromegaly reported in the RCTFigur 1\nChange in signs and symptoms of acromegaly reported in the RCT.

A dis-\ntinct dose response relationship was evident with higher\ndoses more effective than 10 mg PEG\/day. At 12 weeks the\nproportion of patients with normalised IGF-1 levels was\n10%, 38%, 75% and 82% in placebo, 10 mg, 15 mg, and\n20 mg PEG groups respectively. In the RCT extension [8]\nPEG dose was titrated to achieve normal range IGF-1 with\na maximum allowed dose of 40 mg\/day. Figure 2 shows\nthe reported IGF-1 levels. In the cohort treated for 12\nmonths (n = 90) 97% had normalised IGF-1 levels.\nSchreiber [21] collected IGF-1 data for 157 of 229 patients\nat baseline and for 147, 102, and 39 patients after 6, 12\nand 24 months (Figure 2). Mean group values were simi-\nlar to those in the RCT extension [8]. At baseline 11% had\nnormal range IGF-1 and at 6, 12 and 24 months of treat-\nment 64%, 71%, and 76% were in normal range. These\npercentages are distinctly lower than the 97% reported in\nthe RCT extension. Schreiber et al suggested this may be\ndue to better patient compliance and superior monitoring\nfor dose adjustment in a clinical trial compared to the real\nworld clinical practice reflected in their study. Colao [16]\nreported individual IGF-1 levels for 16 patients that fitted\nthe licensed indication for PEG. Of 14 patients evaluated\nat 12 months eight (57%) reduced IGF-1 to within nor-\nmal range and three more to within 1 to 1.3 times normal\nrange.\nFeenstra 2005 [18] and Jorgensen 2005 [19] combined\nPEG with SSA therapy, whilst Jehle 2005 [17] attempted\nreduction of dose frequency (Figure 2). Because daily PEG\nis very expensive these strategies might reduce the overall\ncost of maintaining IGF-1 within normal range.

The Jorgensen\nstudy [19] comprised 5 study phases: therapy with SSA,\nwithdrawal from SSA for 2 months, PEG at 10 mg\/day (6\nweeks), PEG at 15 mg\/day (6 weeks), and finally 12 weeks\nof 15 mg\/day PEG combined with 30 mg long acting SSA\nevery 2 to 4 weeks. IGF-1 was measured at the end of each\nstudy phase. The final combined therapy reduced IGF-1 to\nlower levels than single therapy with either LASSA or PEG\nbut the difference just failed to reach statistical signifi-\ncance. The lack of a true control for each phase of study\nand problems of treatment carryover complicate interpre-\ntation of these results. On combined therapy 9 of 10\npatients achieved normal IGF-1 levels. Jehle 2005 [17]\ninvestigated 10 patients who had failed to normalise IGF-\n1 with DOPAs or SSAs. Mean PEG treatment was for 15.3\nmonths; all patients normalised IGF-1 and 5 were able to\nreduce frequency of dose administration to less than daily\nwhile retaining a normal IGF-1.\nClinical effectiveness: effect on GH levels\nIn the RCT PEG treatment substantially increased serum\nGH levels by up to 15 ng\/ml above baseline levels (of ~8\nng\/ml) and the increase from baseline reached statistical\nsignificance for all three dose regimens. However, for\npatients receiving placebo the change was small and not\nstatistically significant (Figure 3). A dose response rela-\ntionship was evident with higher dose inducing greater\nincrease. In the RCT extension [8] for the cohort treated\nfor 6 months with PEG the mean GH level was substan-\ntially elevated to double that at baseline (Figure 3).\nColao [16] reported individual GH levels for 16 patients.\nThe mean baseline GH ranged from 3.4 to 74.8ng\/ml\n(mean 23ng\/ml; 95% CI: 10.9 to 35.0). After treatment,\ndiscounting one patient who failed to inject PEG, the\nrange was 6.3 to 145ng\/ml (mean 33.1; 95% CI: 11.3 to\n54.9). Not all patients increased their GH level. The range\nof change from baseline was -17 to + 52ng\/ml and group\nmean change from baseline was +10.8ng\/ml (95% CI -1.7\nto +23.3).\nIn the study of Jorgensen 2005 [19] (n = 11) PEG treat-\nment alone more than doubled group mean GH levels.\nSubsequent combination of 15mg PEG\/day with LASSA\ntreatment (every two to four weeks) appeared to decrease\nGH levels and suppress some of the induced rise due to\nPEG (difference in group means not statistically signifi-\ncant). PEG may interfere with commercial kit-based\nimmunoassays for GH Paisley et al 2007 [25], and this\ncould impact on the quantitative interpretation of pub-\nlished results.\nIncrease in GH levels with PEG treatmentFigure 3\nIncrease in GH levels with PEG treatment.

One patient withdrew from PEG because\nof persistent headache and another due to raised serum\nlevel of liver enzyme; one placebo patient also withdrew\nfor persistent headache. The RCT extension [8], and stud-\nies of Schreiber [21], and Jehle [17] also reported adverse\nevents (Table 2). The RCT extension [8] reported higher\nrates of adverse events than the RCT. Of 160 participants\nwho received PEG thirty (19%) withdrew from treatment\nfor various reasons (nine for adverse events, five for lack\nof efficacy, twelve \"voluntarily\", and two each were lost to\nfollow up or \"violated protocol\"). Overall withdrawal in\nSchreiber [21] was unclear. In the 12 month study of\nColao [16] four of 16 patients (25%) withdrew or were\nwithdrawn, one each for: failure to inject PEG; raised liver\nenzyme level; inability to follow the protocol; poor com-\npliance. The RCT extension [8] reported that liver enzyme\nactivities in serum remained within normal range during\nPEG treatment. Schreiber [21] reported abnormally raised\nserum levels of liver enzymes in 21 of 229 (9%) patients;\nin 12 of these the levels were \u2265 3-fold above normal.

In this report 6 of 142 (4%) withdrew per-\nmanently from PEG because of raised liver enzyme levels.\nClinical effectiveness: miscellaneous outcome measures\nA miscellany of further outcomes were reported mostly\nfrom retrospective laboratory analyses of serum samples\nfor surrogate markers of disease-risk (diabetes, cardiovas-\ncular disease, maladjusted bone turnover) in subgroups of\npatients from other studies (mainly the RCT [7] and\/or its\nextension [8]). Four studies [9,13,16,22] reported on sta-\ntistical significance of before versus after PEG treatment\nchanges in the levels of several risk markers for cardiovas-\ncular disease. The findings (Table 3) were not consistent\nbetween studies and no firm conclusions justifiable. One\nstudy reported statistically significant improvement in\ncardiac structure and function after 18 months of PEG\ntreatment using Doppler echocardiography[20].\nTwo studies [10,15] presented data on serum markers of\nbone metabolism. The results (Table 4) support the prop-\nosition that PEG reduces bone turnover in acromegaly;\nhow this translates to patient benefit requires further\ninvestigation. Several small non-randomised studies\nreported on laboratory measures relating to insulin and\/\nor glucose metabolism; these included those of Barkan\n2005 (n = 53) [24], Parkinson 2002 (n = 20) [22], Parkin-\nson 2003b (n = 16) [23], Colao 2006 (n = 16) [16], Jehle\n2005 (n = 10) [17], Jorgensen 2005 (n = 11) [19]. The gen-\neral direction of findings was for a favourable change\nindicative of improved metabolic adjustment. The signifi-\ncance of these findings for patient well-being is difficult to\njudge.\nEconomic analysis\nOne publication was included. This 2005 Technology\nAssessment [26] for the Welsh Medicines Partnership\n(WMP) described and critiqued a manufacturer's (Pfizer\nUK Ltd) submitted decision analytic model of PEG treat-\nment versus standard care (SC) from the perspective of the\nUK NHS. The WMP re-ran the model using \"preferred\nparameters\". We were provided with a working version of\nthe manufacturer's model (MM). Figure 4 shows the deci-\nsion tree structure of the model.\nDescription of Manufacturer's Model\nThe MM assumed SC to be treatment with long acting\nSSAs. It considered 100,000 English male patients starting\ntreatment at an average age of 45 years and continuing\nPEG for at least 20 years. Benefits of PEG derived from\nimproved survival and improved quality of life (QoL).\nThe survival of SC patients (the comparator population)\nwas obtained by applying a standardised mortality ratio\nfor acromegaly (2.63, Bates 1993 [27]) to the National\nStatistics life table for English men aged 45 to 65 years. To\ncalculate survival benefit it was assumed that 92% of PEG\ntreated patients were responders and attained the survival\nprobability of English males while 8% were non-respond-\ners and remained in PEG treatment with the survival prob-\nability of standard care (SC) patients. For those who\nstopped PEG treatment after 20 years survival probability\nat each subsequent year thereafter was the same as that for\nthe SC survivors to that year. The resulting survival curves\nare shown in Figure 4. The survival benefit was calculated\nfrom the difference between survival curves. In the\nabsence of pertinent data a utility gain in QoL was\nassumed to be equal to the disutility of patients experienc-\ning a coronary event (0.83 - 0.75 = 0.08) and in the MM\nwas experienced by all PEG treated patients (including the\n8% non-responsive PEG-treated patients). The same gain\nwas applied for each year of PEG treatment. With dis-\ncounting at 3.5% for costs and benefits the MM delivered\nincremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) at 20 years of\n\u00a3105K\/quality adjusted life year (QALY) and \u00a3194K\/life\nyear gained (LYG).\nWelsh Medicines Partnership's re-run of Manufacturer's \nModel\nThe WMP re-ran the MM using preferred parameters that\nincluded survival of PEG responders taken as that of a mix\nof Welsh men and women in proportion and with sur-\nvival probability from National Statistics life tables; sur-\nvival in SC was obtained by applying an SMR of 1.55\n(Orme 1998 [28]). The impact of these changes on the dif-\nference in survival curves for PEG and SC treated individ-\nuals is shown in Figure 4. The ICER generated at 20 years\nwas \u00a3748K\/LYG.\nCurrent author's re-run of Manufacturer's Model\nWe estimated a feasible lower limit for the ICER of PEG\ntreatment versus SC. To do this we adopted a \"perfect\ndrug\" scenario in which model inputs were all in favour of\nPEG relative to SC but remained within reasonable\nbounds set by available information. We assumed com-\nplete compliance with PEG treatment and complete effec-\ntiveness so that survival and QoL were returned to those\nof the general population. This simplifies the model by\neliminating the non-responder arm (dashed line in Figure\n4) as it was unrealistic that non-responder patients would\npersist with PEG for 20 years. With regard to survival we\nadopted two further changes: first the general population\nwas taken from National Statistics life tables for English\nmen and women aged 45 onwards; second we applied a\nstandardised mortality ratio of 3.6. We reasoned that sur-\nvival of acromegaly patients eligible for PEG would likely\nbe poorer than for the generality of acromegaly patients,Page 9 of 15\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Endocrine Disorders 2009, 9:20 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6823\/9\/20such as those in Orme [28]. Thus, we assumed survival of\npatients eligible for PEG to be more like that observed in\nearly studies before the development of long acting SSAs\nwhich normalise IGF-1 and GH in many patients. In addi-\ntion many of the patients eligible for PEG will have had\nradiotherapy which is a known independent indicator of\npoorer survival [29,30]. We therefore examined standard-\nised mortality ratios from studies of more than a decade\nago (Figure 5). We increased the highest ratio from these\nstudies by 10% giving a standardised mortality ratio for\nthe perfect drug scenario of 3.6. The resulting survival\ncurves are compared with the MM and WMP curves in Fig-\nure 4.\nTable 3: Risk indicators for CVD: comparison for before v. after PEG There were small numbers of participants and changes for most \nmarkers did not reach statistical significance\nSesmilo 2002 [9]\u00a7\nn = 26\nColao 2006 [16]\nn = 16\nParkinson 2002 [22]\u2020\nn = 20\nParkinson 2002 [22]\u2020\nn = 20\nPaisley 2006 [13]*\nn = 20\nPARAMETER Mean change from base-\nline P\nPaired t test\nBefore\nv.\nafter Tx P\nPaired t test Before\nv.\nafter Tx P\nCases:\nBefore Tx\nv.\nafter Tx P\nCases before Tx\nv.\nHealthy controls P\nTotal chol (mM) 0.22 NS NS Increased <0.01 Increased <0.01 0.16\nHDL chol (mM) 0.006 NS Increased 0.0017 NS -- --\nLDL chol (mM) -0.13 NS -- Increased <0.01 -- --\n[Total\/HDL] chol 0.21 NS Reduced 0.0012 -- -- --\nTG (mM) 0.25 0.007 NS NS 0.3 0.13\nLipo (a) (mg\/l) -70 0.039 -- Reduced <0.01 -- --\nApo B -- -- Increased <0.01 -- --\nApo A1 -- -- Increased <0.05 -- --\nHomocysteine (?M) -0.16 NS -- -- -- --\nCRP 2 0.0002 -- -- -- --\nInterleucin 6 0.17 NS -- -- -- --\nBlood pressure -- NS -- -- --\nFibrinogen -- NS -- -- --\nHeart rate -- NS -- -- --\nMMP-2 (ng\/ml) -- -- -- Reduced <0.001 Higher <0.001\nMMP-9 -- -- -- 0.76 0.87\nVEGF -- -- -- Reduced 0.008 0.18\n\u00a7 results for the open label part of the study, patients included if they normalised IGF-1 with treatment.

Rowles\n2005 [31] reported utility values for QoL of acromegaly\npatients (72.5% had active disease, 27.5% were in remis-\nsion). Median utility was 0.7 (range -0.07 to 0.92) com-\npared to 0.81 for matched members of the general public.\nTo allow for the fact that patients eligible for PEG would\ncorrespond to patients with active disease we approxi-\nmated the utility of such patients as 0.66 (i.e. 0.81 -\n([0.81-0.7] \u00d7 [1\/0.725])). The utility gain in the perfect\ndrug scenario was therefore 0.15 (i.e. 0.81 - 0.66) com-\npared to 0.08 in the MM.\nThe average dose of PEG\/day for UK patients is 16.5 mg\n(Pfizer UK Ltd, personal communication). At \u00a3100\/20 mg\n(BNF [37]) the average acquisition cost for PEG was taken\nas \u00a330,133pa (assuming vial splitting as necessary). Addi-\ntional cost for MRI scans and laboratory tests (IGF-1 and\nserum levels of liver enzymes) were \u00a3349pa (expert clini-\ncal opinion and NHS reference costs [38]). For the perfect\ndrug scenario we assumed standard care patients were all\ntreated with long acting SSAs; this assumption favours\nPEG since some patients are resistant to LASSAs and if\ngiven pharmacotherapy would receive much cheaper\ndrugs (e.g. DOPAs). The MM used an annual acquisition\ncost for long acting SSAs of \u00a313,289; other independent\nestimates range from \u00a39,000 to \u00a312,000 [39] and \u00a37,000\nto \u00a314,000 [40]. We used \u00a313,289pa. In addition, SC\nincluded costs for scans and laboratory tests (\u00a3349pa as\nabove) and \u00a31,771pa for treatments of co-morbidities\n(Didoni 2004 [41]). The total annual cost for PEG and for\nSC was \u00a330,482 and \u00a315,409 respectively.\nAt 20 and 40 years, with the inputs described above, the\nperfect drug scenario delivers ICERs of \u00a381K\/QALY and\n\u00a3212\/LYG and \u00a365K\/QALY and \u00a394K\/LYG respectively.\nTo reduce the ICER at 20 years to \u00a330K\/QALY would\nrequire a reduction in PEG cost by about one third.\nDiscussion\nWith regard to the volume and quality of evidence on the\neffectiveness of PEG, difficulties in patient recruitment\nmay partly explain the existence of only a single RCT, and\nthe participation of overlapping populations of patients\namongst multiple studies.

In general, study size\nwas small and follow up was short with relatively little or\nunclear reporting about withdrawals from treatment. It is\nlikely very few studies investigated the \"licensed popula-\ntion\". The RCT was conducted before licensing. In 2006\nColao [16] commented \"all these studies were not designed\nto investigate the response to pegvisomant in patients with\nproven resistance to long-term, high dose therapy with somato-\nstatin analogues; these are the patients allowed to receive pegvi-\nsomant treatment in Europe according to the product label.\"\nConvincing evidence indicated that adequate dosage of\nPEG delivers significant reductions in IGF-1 levels and a\nsubstantial proportion of such patients are brought within\nnormal range [7,8,16,18,21]. In contrast the levels of GH\nappear on average to be considerably increased by PEG\ntreatment as shown in the twelve week RCT [7], the\nuncontrolled extension [8] and by two small non-ran-\ndomised studies [16,19]. Individual patient data shows\nGH may not increase in all patients [16]. Tumour size is\napparently unaffected by PEG treatment [8,16-19,21,24],\nat least in the short term, however continued vigilant\nmonitoring of tumour size is mandatory during PEG treat-\nment.\nIn the twelve week RCT [7] PEG improved patient scores\nfor five signs and symptoms of disease (soft tissue swell-\ning, arthralgia, headache, excessive perspiration and\nfatigue). The improvements reached statistical signifi-\ncance for tissue swelling, perspiration and fatigue. Several\nModel structure and survival curvesFigure 4\nModel structure and survival curves.

The curves shown are modelled using mortality data from the Office of National Statistics for England \n(population about 50 million) or for Wales (population about 5 million) as appropriate.\nMANUFACTURER'S SURVIVAL CURVES WMP PREFERRED SURVIVAL CURVES\nMODEL STRUCTURE COMPARISON WITH PERFECT DRUG SURVIVAL CURVES\n0\n10,000\n20,000\n30,000\n40,000\n50,000\n60,000\n70,000\n80,000\n90,000\n100,000\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nYEARS FROM START TREATMENT\nSU\nRV\nIV\nAL\nPEG treated 20 years\ngeneral population\nno PEG (smr 1.55)\nPEG treated for life\n0\n10,000\n20,000\n30,000\n40,000\n50,000\n60,000\n70,000\n80,000\n90,000\n100,000\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nYEARS FROM START TREATMENT\nSU\nR\nVI\nVA\nL\nPEG treated 20 years\ngeneral population\nno PEG (smr 2.63)\nPEG treated for life\nPEG responds to PEG\nstandard care\nunsuccessfully \ntreated \npatient\nsurvives\ndies\nsurvives\ndies\nsurvives\ndies\nnon-response to PEG \n0\n10,000\n20,000\n30,000\n40,000\n50,000\n60,000\n70,000\n80,000\n90,000\n100,000\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nYEARS FROM START TREATMENT\nSU\nRV\nIV\nA\nL\nperfect drug GP \nWMP GP \nMM GP \nWMP SC \nperfect drug SC \nMM SCPage 12 of 15\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Endocrine Disorders 2009, 9:20 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6823\/9\/20small non-randomised studies reported similar trends in\nimprovement.\nIncreased mortality in acromegaly has been associated\nwith cardiovascular problems. The effect of PEG upon risk\nindicators for cardiovascular disease was examined in sev-\neral of the non-randomised studies included in this review\nbut the results were not wholly consistent or easily inter-\npreted. A single small 18 month non-randomised study\n[20] provided evidence that PEG induces favourable\nchanges in cardiac structure and performance.\nThe limited available information indicates that PEG has\na generally mild adverse event profile but occasionally\nraises liver enzyme levels necessitating temporary or very\noccasionally permanent withdrawal [16,21]. This means\nmonitoring for possible liver damage is a necessity during\nlong term administration of PEG. Other side effects\ninclude headache, injection-site reactions, flu-like syn-\ndrome and recently injection-site lipodystrophy sufficient\nto cause discontinuation has been reported [42]. Antibod-\nies to PEG appear rarely to have been measured. Evidence\nis lacking about any relationship between anti-GH anti-\nbodies and decrease in efficacy or an increase in adverse\nevents frequency.\nThe economic model with input parameters all favouring\nPEG relative to standard care (a perfect drug scenario)\nshowed that over a 20 year time horizon the cost effective-\nness of PEG is very unlikely to fall below \u00a380,000\/QALY\nor \u00a3212,000\/LYG. In the absence of special criteria for the\nassessment of orphan drugs, this means that PEG is\nunlikely to represent good value for money when consid-\nered against the current standards applied to interventions\nin the UK Health service.\nConclusion\nPEG effectively reduces IGF-1 levels and improves signs\nand symptoms of acromegaly. Adverse events associated\nwith treatment are of relatively minor severity and low\nprevalence, at least in the short term, and compliance is\nprobably about 80%. When considered against the norms\ncurrently used to determine cost-effectiveness within the\nUK, PEG does not represent good value for money. For\nPEG treatment to be more acceptable to commissioners\nspecial criteria appropriate to orphan drugs would need to\nbe adopted or the cost of PEG reduced.\nSMR values reported in acromegaly studiesFigure 5\nSMR values reported in acromegaly studies.
