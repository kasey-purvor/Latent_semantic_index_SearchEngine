INTRODUCTION\nBallistic protection against dynamic loading requires\nknowledge of body tissue behavior and associated damage\nmechanisms. Expensive ballistic trials may be minimized via\nnumerical simulations. However, models require material\nproperty and calibration data which may only be derived\nexperimentally; availability and ethical considerations mean\nsuch experiments normally involve tissue simulants.\nMammalian tissue is highly complex, with a laminated\nstructure involving numerous extended layers, e.g., epider-\nmis, dermis, subcutaneous fat, (adipose tissue) and muscle.1,2\nNumerous authors have studied the behavior of each of these\nelements\/comparable simulants at low strain rates. For exam-\nple, Jussila et al.1 investigated the response of skin simulants\nbacked by gelatin blocks to impact with lead spheres. They\nfound that \u00021 mm thick chrome-tanned leather exhibited a\nsimilar resistance to penetration to human skin. Further,\nimpact with 5.56 mm\u0003 45 mm federal tactical rounds pro-\nduced petalled exit wounds similar to those observed with\nhuman tissue. Typical subdermal tissue simulants include\n10\u201320 wt. % gelatin1,3 and ballistic soap. While gelatin\u2019s\nviscoelastic behavior mimics human tissue, impact events\ninvolving soap result in plastic deformation (cavity forma-\ntion) equivalent to the peak extent of deformation in gelatin.\nShepherd et al.3 employed the impedance-matching tech-\nnique4 to investigate the dynamic response of 20 wt. % por-\ncine gelatin, with similar behavior to water under shock\nloading observed for strain-rates >105\/s. Comley and Fleck2\nemployed \u201ctrouser tear tests\u201d to investigate the toughness of\nporcine adipose tissue (a potential human adipose tissue sim-\nulant) at strain rates >1\/s. Measured toughness was found to\nbe largely attributable a collagen-based reinforcement mem-\nbrane surrounding lipid-filled cells (adipocytes), with a mini-\nmal contribution from a secondary network of surrounding\ncollagen (known as interlobular septa). In similar work,\nNishioka and Irie5 investigated two commercially relevant\nproperties of porcine perirenal fat; \u201cfirmness\u201d and\n\u201cstickiness.\u201d Both studies employed an Instron Universal\nTesting machine with crosshead speeds of 0.2\u20131.5 mm\/s.\nInterestingly, adipose material was observed to stretch to a\ngreater extent at higher strain rates.\nImpact events often involve strain rates sufficiently high\n(\u0004105\/s) that they overcome the hydrostatic component of\nthe generated stress, leading to hydrodynamic (e.g. fluid-\nlike) behavior. Consequently, knowledge of the hydrody-\nnamic behavior of both projectiles and likely target materials\nis desirable. As discussed, tissue simulants have predomi-\nnantly been characterized at low-medium strain rates, with\nrelatively little information on high strain-rate behavior\napparent in the literature.\nTissue-based systems exhibit extended three-dimensional\nstructures and will seldom be subject to planar impacts.\nSome researchers have had success in interrogating such\nimpact conditions. For example, Rosenberg et al.6 devel-\noped a technique involving the placement of two gauges (of\ndiffering type \u2014 e.g., manganin and constantan) at a given\npoint within a target to monitor stress evolution with time\nin axially symmetric systems where the state of strain was\nnot uniaxial. However, as discussed by Field et al.,7 exten-\nsion of such work to three-dimensional impacts is nontri-\nvial. Plate-impact experiments, where a one-dimensional\nstate of strain (typically with a strain rate \u0004106\/s) is estab-\nlished in a single target material, allow elimination of such\ncomplexity. A flat and parallel flyer plate, driven by a com-\npressed gas\/powder gun, generates a compressive shock\nwithin a target. Inertial confinement allows maintenance of\na one-dimensional state of strain until reflections from\nexternal edges (release waves) arrive. Instrumentation (e.g.,\nembedded stress gauges) allows shock propagation to be\nmonitored; variables not measured can then be calculated\nvia the Rankine-Hugoniot conservation equations.3,8\u201310 The\nfive shock parameters are: shock velocity, US; continuum\nmass\/particle velocity behind the shock, uP; the equilibrium\nlongitudinal (Hugoniot) stress, rX; material density, q, and;\na)Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

Hugoniot relationships represented by\npairs of these variables (e.g., US-uP) describe the physical\nstates a shocked material passes through. Combined with\nstrength data, these Hugoniot relationships allow simulation\nof the behavior of more complex extended three-dimen-\nsional structures under shock.\nHere plate-impact experiments3,8,9 were employed to\ninvestigate the dynamic response of three readily available\npotential tissue simulants for use in ballistic experiments;\nnamely gelatin, ballistic soap (both subdermal\/muscular ana-\nlogues) and lard (adipose tissue). Embedded manganin stress\ngauges allowed both derivation of equations-of-state and\ninvestigation of lateral strength development under shock.\nII. MATERIALS\nThe three tissue analogues investigated were chosen due\nto their ready availability and similarity to various tissue\ngroups. The human body typically comprises 60\u201370 wt. %\nwater and around 20 wt. % fat (rest primarily protein, miner-\nals and carbohydrate).3,11,12 Gelatin, which suspends water\nin a solid form suitable for ballistic testing, behaves in an\nelastomeric manner under impact. An initial large temporary\ncavity \u2014analogous to the area of peripheral damage around\na gunshot wound \u2014subsequently collapses back to a smaller\npermanent cavity, corresponding to the area of crushed tissue\nahead of a penetrating projectile.13 Gel concentrations affect\nballistic properties.13 Here, a 250 bloom porcine gelatin\n(Weishardt International, France), was mixed to 25 wt. % at\n\u000260 \u0005C, with tests conducted at room temperature.3 With\nballistic soap, permanent plastic cavities of comparable\nextent to the temporary cavities formed in gelatin targets\nform under impact.14 Soap formation (saponification)\ninvolves the hydrolysis of fats or oils in the presence of an\nalkali such as sodium hydroxide or (for toiletries) potassium\nhydroxide. Reaction products are a mixture of salts (formed\nby reaction of excess alkali with carboxylic acids formed in\nthe hydrolysis reaction) and alcohols.15 Soaps consist of\nlong-chain backbone structures with active polar \u201cheads.\u201d\nThe third material, considered due to its similarity to mam-\nmalian adipose layers, was a commercially available fat\n(manufactured by Matthews Foods plc and retailed by the\nCo-operative\nVR\nFood Group as \u201cFresh Fields Lard\u201d). Such\nfats possess a complex long-chain structure consisting of\nglycerol units and attached fatty acids.16 Table I summarizes\nelastic properties, measured ultrasonically using a Panamet-\nrics 5077PR pulse receiver in the pulse-echo configuration\n(sound speeds) and a Micrometrics AccuPyc 1330 gas\npycnometer (densities). In all three materials low stiffness\nmade measurement of shear wave speeds (cS) problematic;\nconsequently, values were calculated from Poisson\u2019s ratios\n(m) using the measured values longitudinal wave speeds (cL)\naccording to Eq. (1). A value of 0.47 was assumed for both\nlard and gelatin; based on the assumption that completely\nincompressible materials would have a Poisson\u2019s ratios of\n0.5.17 However, given the greater stiffness of soap compared\nto lard and gelatin, a lower value of 0.4 was assumed.\ncS \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nc2L\n0:5\u0006 m\u00f0 \u00de\n1\u0006 m\u00f0 \u00de\ns\n: (1)\nIII.

Due to the\ndifficulty associated with machining soft materials, targets\nwere cast in-situ into pre-prepared target assemblies with\nfront faces machined to the tolerances detailed above.3,21\nWhere lateral gauges were employed these were pre-encap-\nsulated in (typically) 50 mm Mylar and clamped between\ntwo mating surfaces of a prepared sectioned confinement\nring.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 3 shows typical longitudinal gauge traces for all\nthree materials.

Slight discrepancies between the\nfront and corrected rear-surface Hugoniot stress amplitudes\n\u2014labeled (c) in Fig. 3 \u2014 likely arose because Eq. (2) is\nintended for use in strong-shock hydrodynamic (fluid) sys-\ntems, whereas here strength effects are apparent.

Values for the slope (S) and the\nintercept (c0 \u2013 essentially the materials\u2019 bulk sound speed)\nare included in Fig. 4(a). Interestingly, lard and gelatin both\nexhibit similar bulk sound speeds to water23 (1.58, 1.57 and\n1.45 mm\/ls, respectively), suggesting similar shock response\nat nominal particle velocities. The magnitude of S correlates\nto the first pressure derivative of the bulk modulus,24\u201326\nmeaning higher values correspond to greater compressibility.\nFigure 4(a) therefore suggests that lard is more compressible\nthan soap and gelatin (S equal to 2.47, 1.77, and 1.77, respec-\ntively). The low compressibility of gelatin seems reasonable\nas, like a fluid,26,27 under quasistatic conditions it does not\nappear to support a shear wave.3 Interestingly, soap appears\nto exhibit a similar resistance to compression to gelatin \u2014\nsuggesting that the presence of its polar side groups acts to\nresist compression. Conversely, the (apparent) enhanced\ncompressibility of lard is likely attributable to the ability of\nits polymer-like molecules to deform under compression.\nFigure 4(a) suggests that interaction between the glycerol\nunits\/attached fatty acids comprising lard offers less resist-\nance to compression than that between the soap\u2019s (carboxylic\nacid) salts (such resistance to compression may be due to\nsteric effects,26,28\u201333 or alternatively, in the case of the soap,\nrepulsion between polar side groups could potentially be a\ncontributing factor).\nAll three materials initially follow their respective P-v\nplane hydrodynamic curves. However, at elevated pressures\nballistic soap and lard deviate from the hydrodynamic\nresponse. Eq. (5) relates the hydrodynamic pressure (P) to\nlongitudinal stress and the maximum shear strength (smax) of\nthe material.9 Consequently, the deviation in stress above the\nhydrodynamic curve in Fig. 4(b) may be attributed to an\nincrease in material shear strength. The extent of deviation\nfrom the hydrodynamic response appears to increase with\nimpact pressure in both lard and soap (interestingly, while\nless marked, in the case of the soap deviation appears to begin\nat lower pressures than in the lard). From Eq. (5), this behav-\nior suggests that shear strength increases with impact pres-\nsure. Such behavior in polymeric materials has been linked\nelsewhere to the previously highlighted phenomenon of steric\ninterference.26,28\u201330 Essentially, the greater the polymeric\nside-group complexity, the higher the apparent resistance to\ncompression (e.g., lard and soap here, although in the latter\ncase, repulsion between polar side groups may also be a fac-\ntor). It should be noted that in addition to the steric-based\nmodel discussed above,26,28\u201330 other theories regarding the\nhigh strain-rate response of polymeric materials have been\npostulated. In particular, Porter and Gould34 have developed\na molecular-level technique known as group interaction mod-\neling. This approach, based on knowledge of the potential\nwhich exists between polymer chains and the heat capacity\n(derived from the vibrational frequencies of polymer chains),\nallows derivation of the pressure-dependant continuum poly-\nmer response. Good agreement has been shown with experi-\nmental data in the US-uP plane, with experimentally observed\ncurvatures in the Hugoniot at low particle velocities for many\npolymeric materials closely replicated. Further, recent exten-\nsions of the group interaction model have suggested that it\nmight be extended to allow for the interaction between differ-\ning side groups.35,36 Consequently, while not directly consid-\nered in the interpretation of material behavior here, in the\nfuture this approach may potentially provide a route to\nnumerically predict steric effects.\nP \u00bc rx \u00fe 4\n3\nsmax: (5)\nFigure 5 shows typical gelatin, ballistic soap and lard lateral\nstress profiles. In all cases the initial rise on shock arrival\nleads to an overshoot in stress (again, attributed to ringing in\nthe gauge). The trace for the gelatin is relatively smooth; fol-\nlowing an initial plateau with a gradient of \u0006 0.03 GPa\/ls, a\nsmall decrease in stress at \u00022.5 micro-seconds leads to a\nFIG. 4. (Color online) Hugoniot relationships for gelatin, ballistic soap and\nlard.\n084701-4 Appleby-Thomas et al. J. Appl. Phys. 109, 084701 (2011)\nAuthor complimentary copy. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nlonger secondary plateau whose gradient is just \u0006 0.01 GPa\/\nls. The test is ended by the arrival of release waves from the\nrear of the flyer. Following shock arrival, the lard trace is\nsignificantly noisier than the gelatin response; further, reflec-\ntions from the backing PMMA lead to a reloading after \u00023.5\nls, before release arrival. Again, individual plateaus are\napparent; however over the initial overshoot to reloading\ndata range, a gradient of \u0006 0.05 GPa\/ls results, compared to\n\u0006 0.03 GPa\/ls overall for gelatin. With the ballistic soap,\nhowever, the lateral response is substantially different. Post-\novershoot, following a very short duration (>0.05 ls) pla-\nteau, a consistent negative gradient of \u0006 0.266 GPa\/ls\nresults; very much greater than for gelatin or lard. Finally,\nfaster release arrival occurs due to the use of a 5 rather than\n10 mm thick flyer.\nEquation (6) links lateral and longitudinal stress to shear\nstrength (s). Assuming constant longitudinal stresses behind\nthe shock (Fig. 3), the observed decreases in lateral stress in\nFig. 5 suggest an increase in strength with time.\nThere is, however, substantial controversy over the\ninterpretation of lateral gauge response behind the shock. In\nparticular, perceived changes in strength behind the shock\nhave been linked to shock dispersion between the lateral\nencapsulation and target material.37,38 However, recent work\nby Appleby\u2013Thomas et al.39 has implied that such effects\nare minimal in polymers where encapsulation\/material sound\nspeeds are similar. Further, in this study gauges were cast in\nsitu;21 consequently in most cases only \u00022 mm of MylarVR\nlay ahead of the gauge elements. While recent in-house work\n(not included here) suggests such localized encapsulation\nmay reduce the magnitude of gradients by up to 0.02 GPa\/\nls, such changes are insufficient to affect the overall trends\napparent in Figs. 5 and 6 (introduced below). Consequently,\nestimation of shear strengths from measured lateral stresses\nis adopted here, with any changes in lateral stress behind the\nshock measured as conservatively as possible.\nThe small post-shock-arrival gelatin gradient in Fig. 5\nsuggests little strengthening \u2014consistent with the apparent\nhydrodynamic response in Fig. 4(b). However, the substan-\ntial difference in gradients for lard and soap in Fig. 5, despite\nbroadly similar impact conditions, suggests substantially\ngreater strengthening in ballistic soap. While only one lateral\ntest was carried out with gelatin, several were conducted\nwith both lard and ballistic soap. Shear strengths, shown in\nFig. 6, were calculated based on rY values measured both\nfollowing any initial overshoot in lateral stress and just prior\nto reloading\/release arrival. Constant Hugoniot stress values\nwere assumed, where required calculated from a best-fit to\nthe relevant measured (rather than hydrodynamic) curves in\nFig. 4. For clarity no error bars are included; typical errors in\nshear strength were 6 5%. Furthermore, similar data for a\ncommercial grade aerospace epoxy resin (RTM 6) is\nincluded9 for comparison.\n2s \u00bc rX \u0006 rY : (6)\nThere are a number of key points to note from Fig. 6. First, a\nmaterial-independent (nominally polynomial) increase in\nshear strength with impact stress is apparent. This suggests\nthe operation of similar strengthening mechanisms, unlike the\nmaterial-dependant hardening apparent in Fig. 4(b). It is\npostulated that this strengthening on shock arrival arises due\nto re-arrangement of amorphous polymer-like chains\/mole-\ncules. Second, at any particular impact stress the difference\nbetween the shear strength at the beginning and end of the lat-\neral stress profile (essentially another expression of the differ-\nence in gradients apparent in Fig. 5) is material dependant.\nE.g., at ca. 2.5 GPa this difference in shear strengths is signifi-\ncantly greater for soap than RTM 6\u2014despite the use of 5\nmm rather than 10 mm thick flyers with the soap. This sug-\ngests a material-specific response. Such behavior seems simi-\nlar to that observed previously where greater hardening both\non30 and following26,28,29 shock arrival was found to correlate\nwith the scale of side-group structures in polymeric materials.\nHere, the ionic long chain carboxylic acid salts present in the\nsoap appear to lead to a greater degree of intermolecular\ninteraction under compression. In turn, this suggests that the\nlard\u2019s nonpolar glycerol units\/attached fatty acids are likely\nmore complex than RTM 6 (Ref. 9) (itself more complex\nthan gelatin). The disparity between initial and pre-release\/re-\nloading shear strengths in Fig. 6 is observed to increase in\nmagnitude in line with this proposed evolution in microstruc-\ntural complexity \u2014enhancing the notion that such behavior\nFIG. 5.

CONCLUSIONS\nLinear US-uP equations-of-state have been established for\ngelatin, ballistic soap and lard (over a limited pressure range),\nwith compressibility linked to the slope of the (experimental)\nlinear best-fits. Evidence of apparent strengthening under\nshock observed for both lard and ballistic soap in the P-v\nplane was tentatively attributed to a steric hindrance effect.\nFurthermore, embedded lateral gauges were used to\ninvestigate shear strength both at, and following, shock ar-\nrival. While the controversial nature of this approach was\nhighlighted, its application here was considered justifiable,\nprimarily because gauges were cast in-situ, with minimal\nencapsulating material ahead of the gauge. In particular,\ncomparable target material\/local encapsulation (e.g.,\nMylar\nVR\n) shock velocities meant that shock dispersion would\nbe minimal. Gradients in lateral stress appeared to suggest\nstrengthening under shock \u2014 again tentatively attributed to\nsteric hindrance. However, while shear strength behavior\nbehind the shock appeared material-dependant, its overall\nmagnitude appeared to increase with impact stress independ-\nent of the target material. It was postulated that this was a\nstructural effect, with polymer-like molecular chains com-\npressing at a constant rate on shock arrival before steric hin-\ndrance effects came into play behind the shock.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nDr. Derek Allsop (Cranfield University) and ARUP are\ngratefully acknowledged for scientific and financial support\nrespectively.
