A \nchance to travel on some of the most famous \nocean liners in the world and talk about my \nscience to an enthusiastic audience? It seemed \nchurlish not to apply! \nI\u2019m a regular speaker at astronomy societies and \nschools, as well as having done a couple of stints as \nan \u201cexpert speaker\u201d on Northern Lights pleasure \nflights operated by Lancaster-based Omega Holi-\ndays, so I already had a few presentations suitable \nfor public audiences. So coming up with four dis-\ntinct, stand-alone talks with punchy titles for the \napplication form didn\u2019t seem much of a problem. \nFrom experience I knew that the aurora borealis \nattracted a great deal of public interest, as did the \nwider topic of space weather (the variability of \nthe space environment). Life as an experimental \nsolar\u2013terrestrial scientist naturally takes one to \nsome rather interesting (and often frigid) parts of \nthe world and this seems to capture people\u2019s imagi-\nnation. Perhaps the challenges and rewards of \nworking at high-latitudes would be an interesting \ntheme for my third lecture? And finally, because \nspace always seems to be an appealing topic, a \nlook at how our view of planet Earth has changed \nsince the beginning of the space age would provide \nplenty of scope for an interesting talk.\nI sent my application to Cunard and waited. After \njust a few weeks, the email arrived: could I join the \nMV Queen Victoria in Rome on 29 November for \nher Connoisseurs\u2019 Mediterranean cruise? It didn\u2019t \ntake long to make that decision!\nDay 1: Saturday 29 November\nMy wife and I embark at 7pm at the wet and wind-\nswept port of Civitavecchia, after a fog-delayed \nflight from Manchester to Rome. Once aboard, I \nfind messages from the ship\u2019s entertainment team. \nAfter a quick briefing and a peek at the venue for \nthe talks \u2013 the impressive Royal Court Theatre, \nseating 850 \u2013 there\u2019s just time for dinner and \nlifeboat drill before our late-night departure for \nNaples. The schedule of talks is almost identical to \nthe schedule that Cunard had supplied three weeks \nearlier, except that my final talk on science in the \npolar regions isn\u2019t required after all. With my first \ntalk planned for our first full day at sea (day 6) I \nhave plenty of time to acclimatize to life on-board \nand see some of the other \u201cInsights Programme\u201d \nlecturers \u2013 an entomologist and a historian \u2013 do \ntheir stuff and pick up some tips.\nDay 2: Sunday 30 November\nI\u2019m awoken at 8.30 am by the phone in our state-\nroom. The entertainment coordinator tells me \nthat, due to the bad weather, the ship will not be \nmaking her first scheduled stop in Naples. Instead, \nwe are going to have a day at sea and make directly \nfor our next port, Messina in Sicily. Could I be in \nthe theatre ready to present a lecture at 10 am? I\u2019ve \nembarked with my talks virtually ready to go, but \nbecause of the change of plans, I\u2019m resurrecting \nmy final talk. As I quickly go through my notes \nand get a shirt ironed, revised programmes for the \nday\u2019s entertainment (including my talk) are being \ncirculated to the 2000 passengers.\nAt exactly 10 am, the ship\u2019s Entertainment \nDirector strides onto the stage and after a few \nwords about the RAS and the Insights Lecture \nProgramme, introduces me and my first lecture \n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t happen to a scientist: science in the \npolar regions\u201d. Despite the last-minute change of \nitinerary, there are several hundred guests in the \naudience. All goes smoothly and there are several \ngood questions from the audience at the end.\nLater in the day, I am spotted by some members \nof the audience. To my surprise I find out that \nmany of the guests on-board had already visited \nsome of the locations I was talking about \u2013 such \nas Spitsbergen, Troms\u00f8 and even Antarctica \u2013 on \nother cruises and were thrilled to hear more about \nthe science that went on there.\nDay 5: Wednesday 3 December\nMy next talk is scheduled for 10 am on Thursday \nmorning. I receive a message asking me to appear \non the ship\u2019s own morning TV programme. The \nfive-minute interview is a prime opportunity to \nlet guests know something about me and what my \ntalks will be about.\nDay 6: Thursday 4 December\nA \u201csea day\u201d as the Queen Victoria sails from \nDubrovnic in Croatia to Valletta in Malta. Bad \nweather. The captain announces gale force 12 \nwinds and 6 m seas. The 8\u00b0 list feels much more \nas the usually rock-steady Queen Victoria makes \nher way south. I don\u2019t expect a high attendance: \nalthough an impressive venue, three decks tall and \nbedecked in crimson and ornate gold decor, the \nRoyal Court Theatre is windowless and in the bow \nof the ship \u2013 not necessarily the best place to be if \none is feeling \u201cdelicate\u201d.\nI had underestimated the guests! The theatre is \nfilled with an expectant audience for \u201cThe aurora \nborealis: Nature\u2019s lightshow\u201d. Up on stage, the \nmotion of the ship is pretty significant, but by \nholding on to the podium I keep my dignity. The \nswishing stage curtains provide a great prop when \ntalking about \u201cauroral curtains\u201d and the audience \nseems incredibly enthusiastic. I get a hearty round \nof applause at the conclusion of my talk \u2013 in part \nfor managing to stay on my feet, I suspect. And \nthere are a people waiting for me in the lobby with \nsome pretty searching questions.\nDay 9: Sunday 7 December\nIn response to a note delivered to my stateroom, \nI meet with a passenger to have a chat and try \nto answer some questions. The gentleman con-\ncerned \u2013 a retired medical practitioner from the \nUK \u2013 not only has questions on my talks but on \nwider astronomy and science issues from stellar \nevolution to climate change. I think I manage to \nanswer most of his questions in the 45 minutes we \nspend chatting in the grand lobby.\nDay 11: Tuesday 9 December\nMy penultimate talk \u201cHere is the space weather\u2026\u201d \nattracts another good audience. It seems that \nword-of-mouth is as important as the daily pro-\ngramme when it comes to advertising. Increasingly, \nI\u2019m being approached on the ship and in ports of \ncall by passengers who have been attending the \nlectures and the feedback is very positive. The \nnumber of people waiting in the theatre\u2019s lobby \nfor post-lecture discussions is the biggest yet and \nI answer a stream of questions before taking a \nsplinter-group, who are interested in finding out \nmore about the \u201cFriends of the RAS\u201d scheme, for \na post-lecture coffee and a chat. \nDay 12: Wednesday 10 December\nAfter almost a fortnight on-board, it\u2019s rather sad \nto be giving my final lecture, \u201cMission to planet \nEarth\u201d. Although I recognize many faces, there \nare still newcomers attending the lectures. Several \npassengers have told me that they missed earlier \nlectures but had been watching the taped re-runs \non the ship\u2019s Insights TV Channel. Throughout the \nday, I\u2019m approached by people who tell me how \nmuch they\u2019ve enjoyed my lectures. The enthusiasm \nthat Cunard passengers have shown for the diverse \nrange of Insights lectures is genuinely impressive!\nDay 13: Thursday 11 December\nDisembarkation at Southampton \u2013 all good things \nmust come to an end! The arrangement between \nthe RAS and Cunard certainly seems to benefit all \nconcerned. Cunard are provided with a diverse \ncohort of speakers to satisfy the demands of \nenthusiastic groups of passengers, the Society is \nable to promote its activities and the new Friends \nprogramme to an interested audience, and indi-\nvidual lecturers get the opportunity to give talks \nin a truly unique setting. Would I do it again? You \nbet \u2013 where do I sign up?\nDr Jim Wild is a solar-terrestrial scientist and lecturer \nin the Department of Communication Systems at \nLancaster University.\nSociety NewS\nAstronomy at sea: Jim Wild\u2019s Cunard diary\nJim Wild, as both tourist and lecturer.
