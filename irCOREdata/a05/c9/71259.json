Non-\noccupational exposure of the general human population to a range of man-made lipophilic \norganic chemicals, such as those classed as \u2018persistent organic pollutants\u2019 (POPs), and similar \nchemicals, has been of increasing concern over the last several decades. This concern is based \non the realisation that chemicals with these properties can have serious effects in wildlife and \nhumans, and moreover, that once such effects become apparent, ongoing exposure cannot be \nprevented in the short term. Concern is also linked to the realisation that many chemicals have \nbeen inadequately tested for their safety and the increasing sophistication of toxicology.  In \nparticular, there is increasing evidence that environmentally relevant concentrations of some \nchemicals may have measurable toxic (e.g. endocrine effects) and genotoxic effects in \nhumans and other animals (Golden et al., 1998; Oberd\u00f6rster and Cheek, 2000; Legler and \nBrouwer, 2003; Welshons et al., 2003; Kalantzi et al., 2004a; Kalantzi et al., 2004b). This \nconcern is also fed by the ability to demonstrate widespread contamination because of the \nincreasing sophistication and sensitivity of analytical techniques and instruments. \nSome organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were banned or restricted in North America and \nEurope in the 1970s, but some, such as DDT and HCHs continue to be used in some \ncountries. After widespread commercial and industrial use in a great variety of products, the \nproduction of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was banned in many countries in the 1970s. \n 3\nHowever, PCBs are still in service in capacitors and transformers in many countries, although \nthe Stockholm Convention contains provisions to help ensure the safe disposal of existing \nstocks, and requires that countries aim to eliminate discharges of PCBs formed as by-\nproducts. The persistence of PCBs and other POPs means that they are still present, and \nmobile, in the environment, despite the international restrictions agreed under the Stockholm \nConvention. \nTwo of the three main polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) commercial mixtures (known \nas pentaBDE and octaBDE) were banned from the European market in 2004.  These products \nare now also facing bans in several states in the US, and will be removed from the North \nAmerican market by 2008. However, many products containing these chemicals are still in \nuse, and many end their useful lives in land-fill sites, from where PBDEs may be able to enter \nthe wider environment. Strict furniture fire resistance laws in the UK and some states of the \nUSA (e.g. California) have meant that pentaBDE was probably used more extensively in \npolyurethane foam products in these countries. A third commercial BDE mixture, \ndecabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE), is used in high-impact polystyrene for electronic \nenclosures and as a flame retardant in upholstery textiles (Hardy, 2002) at an estimated rate of \n56,100 tonnes, in 2001, worldwide (Voorspoels et al., 2003). \nThe general human population is predominantly exposed to PCBs and OCPs through \nfoodstuffs (Duarte-Davidson and Jones, 1994) but a significant proportion of certain PBDE \nmixtures may enter humans through the inhalation of dust or vapour-phase PBDEs in the \nindoor environment (Bergman et al., 1997; Sj\u00f6din et al., 2001; Wilford et al., 2004). Human \nexposure to these chemicals has generally been investigated by analysing the chemicals of \ninterest in a variety of tissue samples. This gives what could be viewed, simplistically, as an \n\u2018integrated\u2019 view of the exposure of the subject, since lipophilic chemicals are predominantly \nstored in the lipid deposits of the body, found throughout most tissue types. However, the \n 4\nmechanisms of uptake and storage of these chemicals are not well understood, and indeed \nneither the mechanism, nor the efficiency, of absorption of these chemicals across the human \ngastro-intestinal tract has been characterised to a satisfactory degree (Kelly et al., 2004). \nThere are many complicating factors which impact on the chemical concentrations measured \nin the tissue of a subject, including: individual biological variation; temporal exposure pattern \n(e.g. sporadic, evenly distributed, or following a smoothly changing curve over the subject\u2019s \nlife); lifestyle and personal factors (e.g. age, children carried and breastfed, habits and diet, \ncurrent body-mass index and changes in this over time). The differences in chemical \nbehaviour in people with only slight differences in the characteristics outlined above can be \nappreciated from reports of both net absorption and net excretion of individual PCB \ncongeners in adult male humans under similar conditions (e.g. Juan et al., 2002). \nMan-made lipophilic chemicals are present in all tissue types that have been investigated, and \nit has been shown that, with the general exception of the brain, liver and kidneys, different \ntissues contain similar concentration of these chemicals, when expressed on a fat weight basis \n(Mussalo-Rauhamaa, 1991; Schecter et al., 1991; Schecter et al., 1998; Wingfors et al., 1998; \nAylward et al., 2003). \nA range of study designs has been used to investigate chemical concentrations in human \npopulations in the past, and these have used a variety of sample media, including: tissues from \ncadavers (Duarte-Davidson et al., 1994b; Quintana et al., 2004); milk from nursing mothers \n(Schoula et al., 1996; Harris et al., 1999a); blood (Mussalo-Rauhamaa, 1991; Wingfors et al., \n1998); hair (Tsatsakis and Tutudaki, 2004); and adipose and other tissues by biopsy or from \nresectional surgery (Covaci et al., 2002a; Quintana et al., 2004). Sampling human tissues \ngives rise to issues related to patient care and ethical considerations, and each tissue which \ncan be sampled has advantages and disadvantages. Blood has distinct advantages over other \ntissues for survey studies because it is relatively easy to sample. It is also relatively easy to get \n 5\nethical approval and to recruit volunteers. Blood can be taken from people of all backgrounds \nand ages and, importantly, from both sexes, and does not necessarily preclude or augment the \ninclusion of volunteers with illnesses. In taking blood samples, however, care should be taken \nto exclude the effects of recent meals on chemical concentrations in the blood. In addition, the \nlow lipid concentration, and complex matrix, can lead to difficulty in achieving sufficient \nanalytical sensitivity. \nIt is important to have knowledge of the distribution of pollutant concentrations within a \npopulation, so that changes can be monitored, and comparisons drawn.  In Europe and North \nAmerica concentrations of PCBs and OCPs in human tissues have generally been declining \nsince the 1970s (Nor\u00e9n and Meironyt\u00e9, 2000; Sj\u00f6din et al., 2004). Concentrations of PBDEs \nin human tissues are currently changing in different ways in different regions - for example, it \nappears that PBDE concentrations are reaching a plateau in Sweden, but may still be rising in \nNorth America (Ryan et al., 2002; Sj\u00f6din et al., 2004). Concentrations of PBDEs found in \nhuman milk from the UK have recently been reported to be substantially lower than \nconcentrations found in the USA, but somewhat higher than Finland, Japan and Sweden \n(Kalantzi et al., 2004c). We have also found statistically different concentrations of PCBs, \nOCPs and BDE47 in human milk samples taken between 2001 and 2003 in two regions of the \nUK (Kalantzi et al., 2004c). \nIn this study we determined PCBs, OC pesticides and PBDEs in blood from 154 people, in 13 \ncities and towns, in the UK. The volunteers represented a wide range of ages, socio-economic \nbackgrounds, occupations, and lifestyle patterns. A range of lifestyle, occupation and personal \nfactors may influence chemical exposure and concentrations in an individual, so the responses \nto questions on these parameters were investigated. \n 6\nMaterials and Methods \nMethodological tests \nBefore samples were taken for the survey a range of methodological tests were performed to \noptimise the study design. In order to determine the optimum amount of blood required for \nanalysis of the target compounds a large (approx. 80 g) blood serum sample was prepared for \nanalysis using the analytical methods detailed below. To determine the analytical variability, \nand whether the preferred sampling medium should be plasma or serum, one volunteer gave \nthree samples of serum and three of plasma. Procedural blanks, consisting of blood collection \ntubes (Vacutainers\u00ae) filled with purified water, were treated and analysed as samples, to \ninvestigate whether the collection tubes contaminated the samples with the chemicals of \ninterest. Analytical blanks consisted of purified water. \nThere was no statistical difference, for any chemical group or individual chemical, between \nserum and plasma, on either a whole weight or an extracted lipid weight basis, so either could \nbe chosen as the sampling medium. However, the plasma BD Vacutainers\u00ae, treated with \nlithium heparin, showed detectable concentrations of PCBs, whereas the serum BD \nVacutainers\u00ae showed no detectable concentrations of the chemicals of interest. Therefore, \nserum was chosen as the sampling medium. From the results of the large blood sample, 10 g \nwas chosen as the practical amount of serum to extract and prepare for analysis, which \nallowed the dominant constituents of each chemical class (CBs 28, 74, 118, 153, 180, 194; \np,p\u2019-DDT; p,p\u2019-DDE; HCB; \u03b2-HCH; BDEs 47, 99, 153 - each PCB or PBDE congener \nrepresenting a halogenation level) to be reliably detected (at least 10 times the standard \ndeviation of the blank, or 3 times the detection limit, in the absence of blank concentrations). \nThe analytical variability, based on concentrations expressed per g lipid in serum, was close \nto 30% (RSD - relative standard deviation) for all analytes. \nChoice of volunteers and ethical approval \n 7\n154 volunteers provided samples, between 9 and 19 (median 11) volunteers from each of 13 \nlocations in the UK. The volunteers were sampled in Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, \nEdinburgh, Exeter, Godalming, Huntingdon, Leeds, London, Manchester, Newcastle-upon-\nTyne, Nottingham and Winchester (see Figure 1 for locations), however, they did not \nnecessarily live in these towns.  Of the volunteers, 50 were male and 104 female and the \nmedian age was 40.5 (range 22 to 80). The body mass index (BMI) ranged between 17.7 and \n42.8 (median 23.4). 1 volunteer was vegan, 19 vegetarian, 23 predominantly vegetarians who \nalso ate fish, and 110 were omnivores. 54 of the female volunteers had not had a child, 11 had \none, 18 had 2 children, 10 had 3, and 6 had 4 or more children. The majority of women \nbreastfed all of their children.  \nThe only selection criteria for volunteers were that they were over 18 years old, weren\u2019t \nknowingly pregnant or had any illness or heart condition that might increase the risks \nassociated with having a sample of blood taken.  The volunteers were sampled during the day, \nmostly on week days, which might have selected against people at work.  No claim is made \nabout the representativeness of the sample to the general adult population, but the higher \nproportion of women and vegetarians sampled might suggest that the self-selecting group is \nnot truly representative. \nSample collection \nBlood samples were taken by medical professionals in March, June and July 2003. 40 ml \nwhole blood was taken from each volunteer. Volunteers were asked not to take a meal, or \ndrink any milk, for at least several hours before the samples were taken so that their blood- \nlipid chemical concentrations should represent their \u2018stable\u2019 levels (unaffected by recent \ningestion). Blood samples were taken into BD Vacutainer\u00ae serum tubes (with clotting agent \nand polymer separator). Samples were mixed by inverting the tubes several times \nimmediately after blood collection, and, after 10-15 minutes, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 \n 8\nmin, to separate the serum from the blood cells. Samples were immediately frozen and \ntransported to the laboratory. All samples were still frozen upon receipt at the laboratory, \nwhere they were defrosted and the serum transferred to clean glass containers before being \nfrozen at \u201320 \u00b0C until analysis. \nAnalysis \nSample analysis was performed at Lancaster University using methods based on those \ndeveloped by Hovander et al. (2000), briefly entailing denaturation of the sample with \nhydrochloric acid and propan-2-ol, followed by extraction with a hexane:MTBE mixture. \nSamples were then cleaned using concentrated sulphuric acid, followed by gel permeation \nchromatography (Biobeads S-X3), before the addition of internal standards (CB30, 13C12-\nlabelled CB141 and 13C12-labelled CB208), final volume reduction, and analysis by GC-MS. \nSamples were analysed for 43 PCBs (CBs 18, 22, 28, 31, 41\/64, 44, 49, 52, 54, 70, 74, 87, \n90\/101, 95, 99, 104, 105, 110, 114, 118, 123, 138, 141, 149, 151, 153, 155, 156, 157, 158, \n167, 170, 174, 180, 183, 187, 188, 189, 194, 199 and 203) and 12 organochlorine pesticides \n(\u03b1- and \u03b3-chlordane, HCB, o,p\u2019- and p,p\u2019-DDD, o,p\u2019- and p,p\u2019-DDE, o,p\u2019- and p,p\u2019-DDT, and \n\u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-HCH) using a Finnigan TRACE GC- MS. The gas chromatograph used splitless \ninjection and was fitted with a 50 m CPSil8 capillary column. The mass spectrometer used an \nelectron impact (EI+) source in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode, monitoring the relevant \nmolecular ion m\/z ratios for PCBs and dominant fragments for OCPs. \n21 PBDEs (BDEs 17, 28, 32, 35, 37, 47, 49, 71, 75, 77, 85, 99, 100, 119, 138, 153, 154, 166, \n181, 183 and 190) were analysed using a Fisons MD800 GC-MS. The GC used splitless \ninjection and was fitted with a 30 m DB5 capillary column. The MS used a negative ion \nchemical ionisation (NICI) source in SIM mode, and used ammonia as the reagent gas, \nmonitoring m\/z ratios 79 and 81 for the PBDEs. \n 9\nBDE209 was analysed using a Micromass Autospec Ultima GC-HRMS in EI mode, using a \nresolution of at least 10,000, tuned using perfluorokerosene (PFK). The GC used cool \non-column injection and was fitted with a 15 m DB5 capillary column. The MS used an EI+ \nsource in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode, monitoring m\/z ratios 797.3355 and 799.3334 \nfor BDE209 and m\/z ratios 809.3757 and 811.3737 for 13C-labelled BDE209. \nQuality control \nPCBs and OCPs were analysed using CB30 and 13C-CB141 as internal standards, while \nPBDEs were analysed using 13C-CB141 and 13C-CB208 as internal standards. All samples \nwere spiked with 13C-labelled recovery standards (6 ng total), in 25 \u00b5l acetone, before \nextraction. The standards included 13C12-labelled CBs 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180 and 209 and \n13C12-labelled BDE209. Concentrations were not corrected for the recoveries of these \nstandards, but the recoveries were monitored to assess the effectiveness of the analytical \nmethods. 13C-labelled PCB recoveries averaged 79-84 % and 13C-labelled BDE209 recovery \naveraged 107%. \nOne laboratory blank, consisting of purified water, was analysed for every 10 samples \nanalysed, and average blank concentrations were subtracted from the concentrations found in \neach sample before application of the detection limit. \nControl samples, consisting of the BD Vacutainer\u00ae tubes used for sample collection were \nprepared using purified water. After drawing the water into the tube the water was decanted \nand treated as a normal sample for analysis. One control sample was prepared for each 25 \nblood samples analysed. \nOne in-house reference material, consisting of an equivalent amount of homogenised seal \nblubber lipid to that which was normally extracted from a blood sample, was analysed for \neach 25 blood samples. Concentrations of selected analytes were compared to a control chart \nbased on previous analyses of the reference material. They did not exceed the specified upper \n 10\nor lower action limit concentrations, which were defined as the mean \u00b1 3 times the standard \ndeviation. \nDetection limits \nFor chemicals detected in the blank samples the method detection limit was defined as three \ntimes the standard deviation of the blank value. In the absence of detectable concentrations in \nthe blank samples the method detection limit was defined as the instrument detection limit. \nMethod detection limits were typically (in ng\/g lipid) 0.6 for PCBs, 0.9 for OCPs, 0.2 for \nPBDEs (excluding BDE209) and 36 for BDE209. The relatively high detection limit obtained \nfor BDE209 is due to a combination of the instrument detection limit and the concentrations \nwhich were found in the analytical blanks. \nQuestionnaire \nA questionnaire, completed by each volunteer, included a range of questions relating to \npersonal characteristics, habits, lifestyle and their home. The questionnaire results were \ntransferred into a spreadsheet, and, where appropriate, processed and categorised to a small \nnumber of discrete bands. Questionnaire data used in the statistical analysis included: age; \ngender; body mass index (BMI); current weight trend (gaining\/losing\/stable); sampling \nlocation (i.e. place of main residence); age of main residence; type of area resided in \n(urban\/rural); areas previously resided in; visits to malarial countries; new furniture\/carpet \npurchases (in the last decade); general diet (omnivore, vegetarian, vegan, fish consumption); \nconsumption of organic foodstuffs; number of children carried; number of children breastfed; \nmain occupation type; computer usage (hours per day). \nThe entire data-set, formed by the chemical concentration data and the questionnaire data, was \nanalysed using the \u2018SPSS\u2019 statistical software package. \n 11\nResults and discussion \nThe chemical concentrations found in the serum samples are summarised in Table 1. There is \nevidence, as expected in biological samples, that the concentrations do not conform to a \nNormal distribution (see later discussion), so the data has been summarised using the median, \nranges and quartile values. It should be noted that the LOD is calculated by dividing the \nmethod detection limit (ng or pg per sample) by the weight of sample analysed, and is \ntherefore different for each sample. Values below the LOD are treated as being zero for \ncalculating total chemical group concentrations (i.e. \u2018Total PCB\u2019 etc.). \nWe believe this study represents the most comprehensive survey of organohalogen chemicals \nin humans in the UK in at least the last 10 years, and includes the first report of PBDEs in \nhuman blood serum samples from the general population in the UK. \nPCB, organochlorine pesticides and PCDD\/F concentrations have been shown to be similar, \nwhen expressed as concentration per g lipid, in human adipose and blood serum or plasma \n(Mussalo-Rauhamaa, 1991; Schecter et al., 1991; Wingfors et al., 1998) and also, for PCBs, \nbetween human milk and blood (Schecter et al., 1998). It is likely that most PBDEs also \nfollow this pattern because they have similar physical-chemical properties to the other \nchemicals studied. We have, therefore, included published concentrations in human adipose \nand milk in further discussion, since there is a lack of human serum concentration data in the \nliterature for some of the chemicals tested. \nPCBs \nThe total PCB concentrations (defined as the sum of all congeners detected) ranged from 14 \nto 670 ng\/g lipid, with a median of 170 ng\/g lipid. As expected, CBs 153, 180 and 138 (in that \norder) were the dominant congeners, each contributing more than 10% to the median total \nPCB concentration. \n 12\nPreviously published concentrations of PCBs in the western European population are \nsummarised in Table 2. Only data with acceptable data presentation (i.e. range and median or \ngeometric mean - the arithmetic mean concentration alone is not useful for samples with non-\nNormal distributions) have been used for this comparison. All published studies of PCBs in \nthe UK population are included. It can be seen that the median total PCB serum concentration \nin 2003 is approximately five times lower than the concentration in adipose taken from \n(predominantly male) corpses in Wales in 1990\/91 (Duarte-Davidson et al., 1994b) and \napproximately 2.5 times lower than in milk-fat samples from Wales in the same period \n(Duarte-Davidson et al., 1994a). The range of total PCB concentrations is somewhat broader \nin relation to the median in this study than was found in either of the Welsh studies. Since it \nhas been shown that human exposure to PCBs is predominantly through the diet (Duarte-\nDavidson and Jones, 1994), the decrease in PCB concentration since 1990\/1 is likely to be \ndue to a reduction in environmental (and particularly human foodstuffs) concentrations over \nthe past decade. \nThe median and range of values found in this study are, however, very close to those found in \nhuman breast milk-fat collected in London and Lancaster between December 2001 and \nJanuary 2003 (Kalantzi et al., 2004c). The median total PCB concentration found in this study \nis 2 to 3 times lower than found in studies of human serum (from women aged 50-65 (Koppen \net al., 2002) and from pregnant women (Covaci et al., 2002b) in Belgium) and adipose from a \nvaried population (Chu et al., 2003) in other European studies (between 1991 and 2002). The \nrange of concentrations found in this study has the same upper limit, but a substantially (by a \nfactor of 8 or more) smaller lower limit than found in the other European studies (see Table \n2). The cause of the difference in PCB concentrations between this study and those in these \nmainland European countries cannot be determined, but may be related to different dietary or \nagricultural practices, or different characteristics of the sample populations. \n 13\nOrganochlorine pesticides \nOf the organochlorine pesticides analysed HCB, p,p\u2019-DDE, p,p\u2019-DDT and \u03b2-HCH were most \ncommonly detected and were dominant in almost all samples.  \u03b1-Chlordane and \u03b3-chlordane \nwere not detected in any of the samples analysed.  \nThe range of concentrations found for HCB was relatively small, whilst the range of \nconcentrations found for p,p\u2019-DDE was the largest of any chemical analysed. The median \nconcentrations of HCB, p,p\u2019-DDE, p,p\u2019-DDT and \u03b2-HCH were very close to median \nconcentrations found in milk samples taken from London and Lancaster between 2001 and \n2003 (Kalantzi et al., 2004c) although the ranges of values found for HCB and \u03b2-HCH in this \nstudy are slightly narrower. Organochlorine pesticide concentrations found in other studies of \nwestern Europeans are summarised in Table 3. It can be seen that p,p\u2019-DDE concentrations \nfound in this study are between a factor of 1.1 and 9.9 lower than found in other studies \nconducted since 1990, and in particular that concentrations are somewhat lower than recently \nfound in Belgium. Again, the cause of the difference in concentrations between this study and \nthe other studies cannot be determined. HCB concentrations in this study were rather lower \nthan found in the UK in 1997 or in Belgium in 1999, and \u03b2-HCH concentrations in this study \nwere rather lower than found either in the UK in 1997. \no,p\u2019-DDD, o,p\u2019-DDT, o,p\u2019-DDE, p,p\u2019-DDD, \u03b1\u2212HCH and \u03b3\u2212HCH were detected in few \nsamples. In all cases the p,p\u2019-DDE concentration greatly exceeded (almost always by more \nthan an order of magnitide) the p,p\u2019DDT concentration, indicating that exposure to the DDT \npesticide was either indirect (e.g. through the diet) or historical. In seven cases, however, the \nconcentration of p,p\u2019-DDE was less than ten times the concentration of p,p\u2019-DDT, which may \nindicate more recent exposure. Six out of these samples came from volunteers who had spent \ntime in areas where malaria is prevalent (and where DDT may still be in current use), \n 14\nalthough other volunteers who had also spent time in malarial areas did not show increased \nDDT\/DDE ratios. \nPBDEs \nBDEs 47, 99, 100, 153, 154 and 183 were regularly detected. All of these, except BDE183, \nare constituents of pentaBDE commercial products, whereas BDEs 153 and 183 are \nconstituents of the octaBDE commercial product. Neither product is now used in the \nEuropean Union (Renner, 2004). The median concentration of BDE153 was higher than the \nmedian concentration of BDE47, which is unusual compared to other published data on \nhumans, but was also found in Belgian adipose samples (Covaci et al., 2002b) and in serum \nfrom some occupational groups in Sweden between 1997 and 2000 (Jakobsson et al., 2003). \nA similar pattern was found in milk-fat samples from Lancaster in the UK taken between \n2001 and 2003 (Kalantzi, 2004). The values and the distribution of the concentrations of the \nsum of BDEs 47, 99, 100, 153 and 154 were very similar to that found in Swedish blood \nsamples taken from the general population (van Bavel et al., 2002), with approximately 5% of \nsamples from this UK study and the Swedish study having concentrations higher than 30 ng\/g \nlipid (more than five times the median value). High concentration \u2018outlier\u2019 samples have also \nbeen noted in a number of separate studies of PBDEs in humans (Hites, 2004). This may \nindicate that there is a \u2018normal PBDE exposure\u2019 population and a \u2018higher PBDE exposure\u2019 \npopulation within each country, but the source of the higher exposure is not evident from the \npersonal information provided. Another possibility is that some individuals have markedly \ndifferent capacities to metabolise and\/or excrete PBDEs (for example, human polymorphism \nin cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes has been documented (e.g. Bolt et al., 2003)).  \nBDE209, the predominant congener in the deca-BDE commercial product, was found in 11 \nsamples, ranging in concentration from close to the detection limit (3 samples) to a maximum \n 15\nof 240 ng\/g lipid (230 pmol\/g lipid). It is likely that improvements in the detection limit will \nresult in BDE209 being found in a higher proportion of samples. \nPBDE concentrations in humans in western Europe and North America have been \nsummarised in Table 4. It can be seen that the total PBDE concentrations found in this study \nare very similar to concentrations found in other European countries in recent years, and \nrather higher than were found in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Scandinavia. Median total \nBDE concentrations in the UK are approximately ten times lower than recently found in \nNorth America (She et al., 2002; Mazdai et al., 2003; She et al., 2004), although the \nmaximum BDE concentration is similar in the UK, California and Indiana, and the minimum \nvalue is similar in the Pacific North-West of America and the UK. Both the UK and \nCalifornia have very strict fire resistance laws for furniture which is likely to have led to \ngreater exposure of the general population to the pentaBDE product (previously used to treat \npolyurethane foam for furniture) than people living in other countries or states. This appears \nnot to have led to higher median serum concentrations in the UK, although the range of \ndetected values is broader than in other countries \u2013 perhaps because a small number of people \nmay have particularly high exposure to these chemicals, either at home or through their \noccupation. BDE183 (indicative of octaBDE) was found in this study at a similar median \nconcentration, and with a similar range, to recent studies in Sweden (Jakobsson et al., 2003) \nand North America (Mazdai et al., 2003; She et al., 2004), whereas we found BDE209 \n(indicative of decaBDE) at a higher median concentration than was found in Sweden and \nNorth America, but with a similar overall range of concentrations to Sweden. The highest \nBDE209 concentrations reported in the Swedish study were from occupationally exposed \npeople (in the flame retarded rubber industry), and are similar to those found in the UK in this \nstudy, although the people with the highest concentrations in this study did not work in \nindustries noted for BDE209 use (such as plastic, rubber and curtain fabric processing). \n 16\nStatistical analysis \nAs previously noted, there was evidence that the chemical concentrations did not conform to \nthe Normal distribution. Q-Q plots confirmed that the data was well described by the log-\nNormal distribution for all chemicals except several PBDEs (BDEs 47, 99, 100 and 153) for \nwhich there were a small number of \u2018outlying\u2019 points at the upper extreme of the distribution. \nChemical concentration data were therefore transformed to their natural logarithms (ln) for \nfurther statistical analysis, and the tests were performed both including and excluding the \n\u2018outlying\u2019 points for the relevant PBDEs. To reduce the complexity of the analysis one PCB \nwas chosen to represent each chlorination level represented in the PCBs analysed (CBs 28, \n52, 118, 153, 180 and 194), six PBDEs were chosen (BDEs 47, 99, 100, 153, 154 and 183 \u2013 \nBDE209 was not detected in enough samples for statistical tests to be performed), and the OC \npesticides which were most commonly detected (total HCH, p,p\u2019-DDE, p,p\u2019-DDT and HCB) \nwere included. \nHighly significant correlations (Pearson correlation coefficients 0.34-0.52, significant at the \n99 % level) were found between all \u2018old use\u2019 chemicals, i.e. PCBs and OCPs, (indicating that \nthey are likely to have reached the volunteers through similar exposure patterns, histories and \nroutes) and between individual PBDEs. However, no significant correlations were found \nbetween PBDEs and either PCBs or OCPs. For further statistical analysis the chemicals were, \ntherefore, represented by p,p\u2019-DDE, total HCHs, total PCBs, HCB, BDE47, BDE183 and \ntotal PBDEs (BDEs 47 and 183 are retained separately because BDE183 did not exhibit \n\u2018outliers\u2019 from the log-Normal distribution as BDE47 did, and because of their different \nhistorical usage patterns). \nChemical concentration data were compared to categorised \u2018lifestyle\u2019 factors (age was \ngrouped by decade from ages 20 to 60, using age >60 as a single group, BMI was grouped as \n<20, 20-24.9, 25-29.9 and >30) using a univariate ANOVA, removing factors stepwise until \n 17\nall remaining factors were significant. Using this method it was found that volunteer age-\ngroup (to a highly significant degree \u2013 99%) and location (95%) had the greatest impact on \ntotal PCB concentrations, although no regional differences could be identified (i.e. significant \ndifferences between sampling sites did not follow any geographical, or other, pattern). \nSignificantly different (99%) HCB concentrations were found in volunteers from different \nlocations, with gender also having a significant impact on the differences seen. The ANOVA \nmodel for p,p\u2019-DDE concentrations showed variability may be related to age (99% \nsignificance), and for total HCH may be related to both location and age (99% significance). \nThe ANOVA model could not identify any significant differences between concentrations of \nany PBDEs which could be related to the questionnaire results. \nIt is likely that the sample population in each location (median 11 individuals) is too small to \nreliably identify concentration differences between regions of the UK, although the sample \npopulation in London (19 males and females) was little lower than in a previous study of \nbreast milk (27 females) which did show regional differences (Kalantzi et al., 2004c). \nHowever, principal components analysis of the HCB and HCH concentrations, based on \nlocation, showed that concentrations found in serum from volunteers sampled in Belfast and \nNewcastle could be substantially separated from samples from the rest of the UK (a small \nnumber of \u2018the rest of the UK\u2019 samples overlapped with some Belfast and Newcastle \nsamples). No particular factors associated with samples taken in these cities could be found \nwhich might explain this observation. \nLinear regression analysis showed that many PCBs (generally excluding Cl3-4CBs), p,p\u2019-\nDDE, p,p\u2019-DDT and HCH concentrations correlated highly significantly (at the 99% level) \nwith age, and that HCB correlated significantly (at the 95% level) with age (see Table 5 and \nFigure 2 for examples). The particular PCBs which correlated well with age were CBs 74, 99, \n105, 118, 138, 153, 156, 157, 167, 170, 180, 187 and 194, and those not correlating well were \n 18\nCBs 28 and 183, the remaining PCBs also did not correlate well with age but were detected in \nless than half of the samples. PCB metabolism in mammals is related to the chlorination \npattern (see Strandman et al., 2000), and the easily metabolised congeners generally \naccumulate less than more persistent congeners. This could explain the lack of correlation \nbetween the less chlorinated PCBs and age, and similarly for some of the more chlorinated \nPCBs which are more easily metabolised due to their chlorination pattern. For persistent \nCl6-8CBs, being female had a significant (at the 95% level) negative impact on the slope of \nthis regression (see Figure 2 \u2013 CB180) i.e. with increasing age females tended to have lower \nconcentrations than males. Since we do not expect a difference in exposure, or metabolism, \nbetween males and females in the general population, we presume that this is related to the \ntransfer of chemical to children during gestation and lactation, which is indirectly related to \nage, as that is the only major excretion route different between females and males. However, \nsignificant correlations between chemical concentrations in females and the number of \nchildren carried (or breast fed) were not found. \nConcluding remarks \nThis study was, we believe, the first survey of blood serum concentrations of PCBs, \norganochlorine pesticides and PBDEs in the UK. The data-set produced may be seen as an \nindicator of human concentrations of this range of chemicals in the UK, although it cannot be \nconsidered representative of the UK population in general. In particular, we have shown a \ncorrelation between age and concentrations of the following chemicals: persistent PCBs; p,p\u2019-\nDDT; p,p\u2019-DDE; HCB; HCHs. For the more chlorinated persistent PCBs we have also shown \na significant difference in the age related concentration difference between males and females. \nWe have also found that the UK population in 2003 had similar PBDE concentrations, and a \nsimilar concentration distribution, to that found in the general population in Sweden in 2002, \nwith approximately 5% of the population having more than five times the median PBDE \n 19\nconcentration, which may indicate a sub-population, in both countries, which is more exposed \nto these chemicals than the general population. This is somewhat surprising because of the \nhistory of PBDE production and use in the UK compared to Sweden. We report BDE209 \nconcentrations in humans in the UK for the first time, with a similar overall range of \nconcentrations to that found in Sweden recently, although, in contrast to the Swedish study, \nthe people with the highest concentrations in this study did not work in industries noted for \nBDE209 use. \nThere is increasing regulatory pressure to control persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals \nmore effectively - for instance in the forthcoming European Union \u2018REACH\u2019 chemicals \nlegislation, and under the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants. \nEstablishing levels of contamination in humans and wildlife is an important way of verifying \nthe environmental behaviour of chemicals approved for use. Such monitoring helped to \nidentify penta- and octa-BDE as priorities for banning in the EU, and their proposed addition \nto the list of POPs. Further monitoring will be useful to determine the effect of the EU ban on \nhuman exposure to these chemicals compared to, for instance, the US where restrictions on \nPBDE use have been introduced more recently. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nWe are grateful to the UK Co-operative Bank plc for funding the work reported here, and to \nthe volunteers for taking part in the study. \n \n 20\nReferences \nAylward, L.L., Hays, S.M., LaKind, J.S. and Ryan, J.J., 2003.
