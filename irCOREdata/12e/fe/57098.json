An inter-laboratory calibration exercise was set up in order to test the \ncomparability of results obtained in different laboratories, each using its own preparation \nmethod. Each of the 23 laboratories received the same amount of homogenized splits of four \nQuaternary sediment samples. The samples originate from different localities and consisted of \na variety of lithologies. Dinoflagellate cysts were extracted, counted, and relative and absolute \nabundances calculated. The relative abundances proved to be fairly reproducible, \nnotwithstanding a need for taxonomic calibration. By contrast, excessive loss of Lycopodium \nspores during sample preparation resulted in non-reproducibility of absolute abundances. \nFurther testing of the applied methodologies shows that  losses of Lycopodium spores can \noccur through decantation and\/or sieving.

In general, dinoflagellate \ncyst concentrations are calculated by adding a known amount of exotic markers or a \u201cspike\u201d \nto every sample according to the method described by Stockmarr (1971). The marker \ncommonly used is Lycopodium clavatum Linnaeus (Stag\u2019s Horn Clubmoss or Ground Pine). \nAs noted by Lignum et al. (2008), the so-called \u2018standard\u2019 palynological processing methods \nare still very variable in terms of initial sample sizes, type and concentration of acids, sieve \nmaterial and mesh size, sonication time and strength, number of decanting cycles, use of \nheavy liquid separation, etc. However, critical evaluation of the effect of different laboratory \nprocedures on the marker grain technique for obtaining dinoflagellate cyst concentration has \nso far never been attempted. Although it has been reported that several processing methods \nsuch as sonication and chemical treatments can inflict damage on organic-walled microfossils \nto a certain extent (e.g. Schrank, 1988; Hodgkinson, 1991), the effect on palynomorph \nconcentrations remain unknown.  \nThis study aims to test the reproducibility of the marker-grain method, in order to understand \nthe discrepancies in the results following different preparation techniques. A better insight \nresults in a proposal of recommendations for a standardized method to determine absolute \nabundances of Quaternary dinoflagellate cysts with the marker-grain method. Similar efforts \nto test the reproducibility of specific laboratory techniques have been done for other \nmicrofossil groups: benthic and planktonic foraminifera (Zachariasse et al., 1978), diatoms \n(Wolfe, 1997), nannofossils (Herrle and Bollman, 2004) and their biomarkers (Rosell-Mel\u00e9 et \nal. 2001). It is therefore timely to carry out a similar exercise with dinoflagellate cysts. \n10 \n \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \nSurface sediment samples from four localities (North Sea, Celtic Sea, NW Africa and \nBenguela) were sent out to 23 laboratories. The samples were processed using the \npalynological  techniques routinely used in these laboratories. An equal amount of \nLycopodium tablets, all from the same batch, were added to each sample. The reproducibility \nof both absolute and relative abundances for dinoflagellate cysts is here put to the test, and has \nresulted in a proposal of recommendations for a standardized method to determine absolute \nabundances of Quaternary dinoflagellate cysts with the marker-grain method. Two \nlaboratories used the volumetric method (Dale, 1976) for comparison purposes. This study \nfocuses additionally on whether it is necessary to count 300 or 400 dinoflagellate cysts and on \nsome important taxonomic issues, since notable interlaboratorial differences in nomenclature \nwere recorded.  \n \n2. Material & methods \n \nLate Quaternary surface sediment samples from four sites with different lithologies were used \nby the 23 different laboratories involved in the project. The North Sea sample consisted of a \nhomogenized surface sediment taken using a Reineck boxcorer (51.47\u00b0 N, 3.48\u00b0 E, 10 m \nwater depth). The Celtic Sea sample was assembled through mixing multi-corer samples from \nStation 8, collected during several time slots from the Celtic Sea (51.05\u00b0N, 5.83\u00b0W, 86 m \nwater depth) (Marret and Scourse, 2002). The sample from Northwest Africa was a mixture of \nmulticores GeoB9504-4 (15.87\u00b0N, 16.67\u00b0W, 43 m water depth) and GeoB9503-3 (16.07\u00b0N, \n16.65\u00b0W, 50 m water depth). The Benguela sample consists of a mixture of sediment samples \ncollected offshore Walvis Bay, at a water depth of about 200 m during Meteor cruise M63\/2. \nSample details are given in Table 1. Each laboratory was given a number, followed by a letter \nwhen the laboratory used more than one processing method. Laboratory identification and \n11 \n \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \nnumbers were kept anonymous to eliminate accountability. A brief overview of the used \nmethods is described in section 2.1 to 2.5, a special variation of this method in section 2.6 and \nthe volumetric method in section 2.7. Details of the used methods are given in the \nsupplementary data. An extensive review of preparation techniques for extraction of \ndinoflagellate cysts is given by Wood et al. (1996) and more recently by Riding and Kyffin-\nHughes (2004).  \nHomogenization was done with the quartile method. The samples were oven dried at a \ntemperature of 58\u00b0C for 24 hours. The Lycopodium spore tablets used are produced and \ndistributed by the Subdepartment of Quaternary Geology, University of Lund, Sweden \n(http:\/\/www.geol.lu.se\/kvg\/eng\/). Ten Lycopodium clavatum tablets of batch 483216, \n(X=18.583 per tablet, s=\u00b11708), were dispatched with the samples, and a fixed number of \ntablets was added by each laboratory to each sample.  \n \n2.1 Chemical treatment \n \nHydrochloric acid (HCl) with a concentration of 6.5\u201336 % was added for the removal of \ncarbonate. Some 20 to 300 ml was used depending on the intensity of the reaction. Cold HCl \nwas used in most of the cases, although some laboratories used hot HCl with a temperature \nranging between 42 and 80\u00b0C. Afterwards, the residue was left to settle (15 min to 42 h). \nLaboratories that used short settle times at this step, used centrifugation or sieving to \nconcentrate the sample. Demineralised or distilled water was used for rinsing until pH reached \nmore neutral values of 5 to 7. One to 5 decanting cycles with intervals of 3 to 24 h were \nneeded depending on HCl-concentrations used. To avoid losing residue during decanting, \nsome laboratories used centrifuging for the concentration of the samples. The extensive \nrinsing is necessary for the removal of Ca2+, to avoid calcium fluoride (CaF2) precipitation \n12 \n \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \nduring the following HF treatment. A few laboratories used KOH for neutralization \n(Laboratory 2: 1% and Laboratory 18 b: 10%).  \nThe siliciclastic component was removed by adding 10 to 250 ml of hydrofluoric acid (HF) \nwith a concentration ranging from 19% to 70%. Commonly a concentration between 40 and \n50% was used. All laboratories used cold HF, except laboratories 12 (42\u00b0C), 2 (50\u00b0C), 6 \n(60\u00b0C), 10 (70\u00b0C) and 23 (80\u00b0C). Settling times varied between 12 and 144 h. A few \nlaboratories repeated the HF treatment up to 3 times before all silicates were removed.  \nWithout neutralising, about 10 to 300 ml HCl with a concentration of 6.5 to 36 vol% was \nadded for the removal of formed fluorosilicates. Mostly cold HCl was used, although some \nlaboratories used hot HCl with a temperature ranging between 42 and 100\u00b0C. The following \nsettling time varied between 15 min to 72 h. Laboratories that used short settling times, used \ncentrifugation. The sample was subsequently rinsed with distilled water, until pH reached 5\u2013\n7. The rinsing took 1 to 6 decanting cycles with intervals of 3 to 24 h, depending on the \nconcentrations used. To avoid losing residue during decanting, some laboratories used \ncentrifuging for the concentration of the samples. One laboratory used KOH for the \nneutralisation (Laboratory 2: 1%). A few laboratories skipped the second HCl treatment and \nproceeded directly to the rinsing with distilled water until pH reached values of 5\u20137. Several \nof these laboratories used centrifuging and\/or sieving for concentration of the samples. During \nrinsing toxic HF was decanted and removed. \nOne laboratory (Laboratory 22b) oxidised three of the samples (excluding the North-West \nAfrica sample) with Schulze\u2019s solution (70% nitric acid saturated with potassium chlorate).  \n \n2.2. Mechanical treatment \n \n13 \n \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \nCentrifugation is often used to concentrate the organic material. The rotation speed used \nvaried from 1900 to 3500 rpm, and lasted between 5 sec to 10 min. \nHeavy liquid separation for the removal of heavy minerals was carried out by a few \nlaboratories. Labs 10 and 16 used sodium polytungstate (SPT) at specific densities to isolate \nthe palynological fractions.  \nBetween 13 and 1800 seconds sonication was used to break down organic matter aggregates \nby some laboratories. Most laboratories used sonic baths (Branson\u2122, Sonimasse\u2122, \nSonicor\u2122, Eurolab\u2122). Laboratory 8 used a standard oscillating sensor. \n \n2.3. Sieving \n \nSome laboratories pre-sieved before the chemical treatment for the elimination of the coarse \nfraction (sieve widths 100, 106, 120, 150 \u00b5m) and\/or fine fraction (sieve widths 10, 11, 15 \n\u00b5m). All the laboratories added the Lycopodium tablets before pre-sieving, except Laboratory \n23.  \nThe sieving was used after the chemical treatment to remove the fine fraction from the \nresidue. Calgon (sodium hexametaphosphate) was used to disaggregate the material in a few \ncases. The sieve mesh sizes used varied from 6 to 20 \u00b5m, and meshes were made of nylon, \npolyester, polymer or steel. The devices used were hand, mechanical and water pressure \npumps. Some laboratories sieved without using a pump. \n \n2.4. Staining and mounting of the slides \n \nStaining with a colouring agent enhances contrast for optical microscopy purposes and might \nbe useful for the detection of pre-Quaternary specimens (Stanley, 1966).  Safranin-O, Fuchsin \n14 \n \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \nor Bismark Brown was used by a few laboratories. Not every laboratory stained the residue. \nFinally a few drops of a copper sulphate solution, thymol or phenol were often added to the \nresidue for the inhibition of fungal growth.  \nSlides were mounted on a heated metal plate (65\u00b0C) using a pipette, by strewing or a mix of \nboth methods. The mounting medium was usually glycerin jelly, but sometimes thymol, \nElvacite, Eukitt, UV adhesive, or Canada balsam was used. Although sealing is not per se \nnecessary (Poulsen et al., 1990), nail polish or paraffin wax was used for sealing the margins \nof the cover slip protecting the residue from degradation by dehydration.  \n \n2.5 Counting of the palynomorphs and calculation of absolute abundances \n \nDinoflagellate specimens were counted only when they comprised at least half of a cyst. The \nsame criterion was used for other palynomorphs, also counted by some of the laboratories. \nInitially 300 dinoflagellate cysts were counted, and subsequently an extra 100 specimens were \nadded. The purpose was to check whether it is necessary to count 300 or 400 dinoflagellate \ncysts to obtain representative relative and absolute abundances. Indeterminate dinoflagellate \ncysts were grouped as Indeterminate spp., and were not taken into account for the calculation \nof the relative abundances, since every observer had a different concept of what counts as an \nindeterminate dinoflagellate cyst, and this would introduce observer bias into the relative \nabundances. Raw counts together with a summary of the methodology used are available as \nsupplementary data to this article.  \nAbsolute abundances of dinoflagellate cysts are calculated following the equation by \nBenninghoff, 1962:  \n \nwL\ntLdc\nc\ntc\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\u00d7=  353 \n15 \n \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n358 \n359 \n360 \n361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \nwhere \nc = concentration = number of dinoflagellate cysts \/ gram dried sediment. \ndc = number of counted dinoflagellate cysts  \nLt = number of Lycopodium spores \/ tablet \nt = number of tablets added to the sample \nLc = number of counted Lycopodium spores \nw= weight of dried sediment (g) \n \nMaher (1981) devised an algorithm to calculate confidence limits on microfossil \nconcentrations. A slight correction to this algorithm was made, since the current study used \nsediment weight instead of sediment volume. The confidence limits calculated based on this \nalgorithm have a 0.95 probability (Z=1.95). It should be noted that these confidence limits are \nsimilar to the total error on concentration proposed by Stockmarr (1971) (Appendix 2). These \nconfidence limits can then be used in a statistical test to check whether microfossil \nconcentrations are the same in two different samples (Maher, 1981). To investigate the \nreproducibility of results from the different laboratories, the coefficient of variation (or \nrelative standard deviation) of all counts of a particular sample can be compared. Ideally, the \nresults should fall within the confidence limits of Maher (1981), and thus the coefficient of \nvariation calculated from these confidence limits can be used as a comparison.  \n \n2.6. Special methods: the maceration tank method (with HF) and the washing machine \nmethod (without HF) \n \nThe maceration tank method (Poulsen et al., 1990; Desezar and Poulsen, 1994) was used for \nHF treatment by Laboratory 20a. Other processing steps are similar to those used by the other \n16 \n \nlaboratories and are detailed in Poulsen et al. (1990) and Desezar and Poulsen (1994). Each \nsample is tightly wrapped in filter cloth (25 cm x 25 cm) with a mesh size of 10 \u00b5m, and the \nfilter bags are packed in rubber foam for protection. The samples are placed inside the \nmaceration tank and HF is conducted to the tank in PVC tubes. The samples are treated with \ncold HF for 7-8 days, after which the HF is drained out through a bottom-stop cock and led \nvia PVC tubes directly to a waste-container for used hydrofluoric acid. \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n383 \n384 \n385 \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \nWith the washing machine method, used by Laboratory 20b, no HF is used.  Each sample is \ntightly wrapped in filter cloth (25 cm x 25 cm) with a mesh size of 10 \u00b5m and and the filter \nbags are packed in rubber foam for protection . The samples are placed in a standard \nhousehold washing machine and washing occurs with a standard household washing powder, \nafter which carbonates are removed with citric acid at 65\u00b0C. Next the samples are again given \na normal wash with a standard household washing powder. Finally the remaining minerals are \nremoved by heavy liquid separation. This method cleans the samples very efficiently from \nmost of the amorphous material. Furthermore, since HF is not used, siliceous constituents \n(e.g. diatoms) are not destroyed.  Heavy liquid separation with zinc dibromide (ZnBr2) was \nused at specific densities (2.3, 2.0 and 1.8 g\/ml) to remove heavy minerals. In order to test the \ninfluence of the specific density of the ZnBr2, the NW African sample from 20b, was \nseparated at specific densities at 1.8, 2.0 and 2.3 g\/ml.   \n \n2.7. Volumetric method  \n \nFor comparison with the marker-grain method, the volume aliquot method was performed by \nlaboratories 6 and 8 following Dale (1976). This method was not used for the North Sea \nsample because of the difficulty associated with counting a fixed volume of this sample with \nvery low abundances.  \n17 \n \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \n409 \n410 \n411 \n412 \n413 \n414 \n415 \n416 \n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n423 \n424 \n425 \n426 \n \n3. Results \n \n3.1. Relative abundance of dinoflagellate cysts \n \nA cause for the quantitative and qualitative disparities between assemblages recorded by the \nlaboratories may be due to the different processing methods employed. It is obvious that \naggressive agents could destroy the more sensitive cysts. To check this dependence of \npreservation on methodology, it is warranted to group species according to their resistance to \ndegradation. It is hereby assumed that both mechanical and chemical degradation have similar \neffects on an assemblage. The grouping proposed here is similar to the grouping described in \nZonneveld et al. (2001). Cysts not referred by these authors were added to a particular group \nbased on the assumption that comparable morphology (e.g. wall thickness, resistance of \nstructures against folding) is indicative of similar resistance to decay.  \nExtremely sensitive cysts: round brown cysts (RBC), spiny brown cysts (SBC), cysts of \nAlexandrium spp., cysts of Gymnodinium spp., Stelladinium spp., Lejeunecysta spp., \nSelenopemphix spp., Tuberculodinium vancampoae, Polykrikos spp., Xandarodinium xanthum \nand Dalella chathamense.  \n \nModerately sensitive cysts: Lingulodinium machaerophorum, Operculodinium spp., \nPyxidininopsis reticulata, Spiniferites spp., Quinquecuspis concreta, Trinovantedinium \napplanatum and Votadinium spp. \n \n18 \n \nResistant cysts: Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus, Impagidinium spp., Operculodinium \nisraelianum, Pentapharsodinium dalei, Polysphaeridium zoharyi, Ataxiodinium choane and \nBitectatodinium spp. \n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \n433 \n434 \n435 \n436 \n437 \n438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n443 \n444 \n445 \n446 \n447 \n448 \n449 \n450 \n451 \n \nWithin these three groups, it is also interesting to note which taxa demonstrate the largest \nvariation, and the results of the individual taxa will also be described in the following \nparagraphs. It is evident from the dataset that some species were not recorded by some \nobservers. One obvious example is Dubridinium spp., which was often counted as RBC, or in \nsome cases not counted at all. To partly reduce this observer bias, we decided to group species \ninto genera or even larger groups (Appendix 1). Averages of relative abundances were only \ncalculated when at least 300 dinoflagellate cysts were counted. The counts from oxidized \nsamples (Laboratory 22b) were also excluded, since all heterotrophic cysts were destroyed. \nThe average results of the four samples are shown in Table 2. Representative cysts from the \nfour samples are shown in Plate I to IV. \n \n3.2. Absolute abundances of dinoflagellate cysts \n \nThe cyst concentration (absolute abundance) in the North Sea sample ranges from 570 to \n3,304 cysts\/g, excluding the outliers. Laboratory 1a makes an overestimation (8,342 cysts\/g) \nand Laboratory 22b produced very low numbers (278 cysts\/g). The average is 1,516 cysts\/g \nwith a standard deviation of 698 cysts\/g (coefficient of variation, V=46%). The average \ncoefficient of variation from the confidence limits of Maher (1981) is 20%. The volumetric \nmethod was not used for the North Sea sample (Table 2).  \nThe cyst concentration (absolute abundance) in the Celtic Sea sample ranges from 1,240 to \n5,284 cysts\/g, excluding the outliers. Laboratories 14 and 1a overestimate with 75,633 and \n19 \n \n452 \n453 \n454 \n455 \n456 \n457 \n458 \n459 \n460 \n461 \n462 \n463 \n464 \n465 \n466 \n467 \n468 \n469 \n470 \n471 \n472 \n473 \n474 \n475 \n476 \n477 \n478 \n10,961 cysts\/g respectively, while Laboratory 20a, 2 and 20b gives respectively low values of \n1,053, 731 and 501 cysts\/g. The average is 2,583 cysts\/g, with a standard deviation of 1,342 \ncysts\/g (V=52%). The average coefficient of variation from the confidence limits of Maher \n(1981) is 25%. Results obtained by the volumetric method give estimates that are much lower \nthan with the marker grain method. For the Celtic Sea these values (1,160 cysts\/g (Laboratory \n6) and 1,167 cysts\/g (Laboratory 8)) are even below the lowest value obtained by the marker \ngrain method (Table 2).  \nThe cyst concentration (absolute abundance) in the NW Africa sample ranges from 4,606 to \n38,357 cysts per gram, excluding the outliers: labs 11, 1a and 14 produced very high numbers \n(168,899, 167,651 and 129,236 cysts\/g, respectively). The average is 19,441 cysts\/g, with a \nstandard deviation of 9,148 cysts\/g (V=47%). The average coefficient of variation from the \nconfidence limits of Maher (1981) is 23%. As before, the volumetric method gave lower \nestimates but within the range of the marker grain method (11,600 cysts\/g (Laboratory 6) and \n9,992 cysts\/g (Laboratory 8)) (Table 2). \nThe cyst concentration (absolute abundance) in the Benguela sample ranges from 30,130 to \n298,972 cysts\/gram, excluding the outliers. Laboratory 1c produced an overestimated value of \n1,455,988 cysts\/g, while laboratories 20b and 8 give values as low as 18,472 and 15,910 \ncysts\/g, respectively. The average is 144,299 cysts\/g with a standard deviation of 84,159 \ncysts\/g (V=58%). The average coefficient of variation from the confidence limits of Maher \n(1981) is 21%. The volumetric method used by Laboratory 6 yields 53,200 cysts\/g (within the \nrange above) and 8,492 cysts\/g by Laboratory 8. The volumetric estimate by Laboratory 8 is \nconsidered to be an underestimation caused by the destruction of fragile cysts by sonication \n(see Discussion) (Table 2). \n \n3.3. Reworked dinoflagellate cysts \n \n \n20 \n \n479 \n480 \n481 \n482 \n483 \n484 \n485 \n486 \n487 \n488 \n489 \n490 \n491 \n492 \n493 \n494 \n495 \n496 \n497 \n498 \n499 \n500 \n501 \nAbout 7% of the recorded dinoflagellate cysts in the North Sea sample were reworked. The \npre-Quaternary cysts recorded in the North Sea sample were Wetzeliella spp. (dominant), \nGlaphyrocysta spp., Cordosphaeridium spp., cf. Oligosphaeridium spp. and cf. \nCribroperidinium spp. In terms of absolute abundances, reworking shows the same trends as \nin situ dinoflagellate cyst absolute abundances. Very high absolute abundances were recorded \nin the sample oxidized by Laboratory 22b. This indicates that the robust pre-Quaternary cysts \nare more resistant to oxidation. Reworking is very low (less than 1%) in the samples from the \nCeltic Sea, NW Africa and Benguela. \n \n3.4. Other palynomorphs \n \nChlorophycean palynomorphs such as Cymatiosphaera sp. (not present in Celtic Sea), \nPediastrum sp., Pterospermella sp. (not present in Benguela), Tasmanites sp., Botryococcus \nsp. (not present in Benguela), Mougeotia sp. (only North Sea), Concentricystes circulus (only \nNW Africa), Gelasinicysta sp. indet. (only NW Africa) are recorded in low numbers in all \nsamples, except the North Sea sample.  \nFaunal remains such as microforaminiferal linings, scolecodonts, tintinnids, planktonic \ncrustacean eggs and invertebrate mandibles were encountered in almost every sample. \nPlanktonic crustacean eggs are very abundant in the North Sea sample.  \nPollen and spores are abundant in the North Sea sample. The assemblage is dominated by \npollen (90%). Non-bisaccate pollen include Quercus, Corylus, Betula, Alnus, Poaceae, \nCyperaceae and Chenopodiaceae, whereas bisaccate pollen comprise mainly Pinus and Picea. \nSome Cedrus pollen is recorded. Reworked pollen and spores are present in low numbers. \n21 \n \n502 \n503 \n504 \n505 \n506 \n507 \n508 \n509 \n510 \n511 \n512 \n513 \n514 \n515 \n516 \n517 \n518 \n519 \n520 \n521 \n522 \n523 \n524 \n525 \n526 \nThe Celtic Sea sample is dominated by pollen (94%). Non-bisaccate pollen comprises mainly \nPoaceae, Quercus, Ericaceae and Chenopodiaceae. Bisaccate pollen is mainly Pinus pollen. \nReworked pollen and spores are very rare.  \nThe sample from NW Africa is also dominated by pollen (95%). Non-bisaccate pollen \ncomprise mainly Poaceae, Quercus, Ericaceae and Chenopodiaceae. The bisaccate pollen are \nmainly Pinus pollen. Reworked pollen and spores are very rare.  \nThe Benguela assemblage is dominated by pollen (99%). Non-bisaccate pollen includes \nmainly Poaceae, Asteraceae and Caryophyllaceae. Bisaccate pollen is mainly Pinus pollen. \nNo reworked pollen and spores were recorded.  \nHyphae and fruiting bodies were counted as fungal remains in order to check whether the \nsamples were infected by fungi. No samples showed significant abundances. \nThe recorded incertae sedis algae include Cyclopsiella, Halodinium sp., Hexasterias \nproblematica (not present in Northwest Africa), Micrhystridium sp. (Celtic Sea and \nBenguela), Palaeostomocystis subtilitheca (North Sea and Celtic Sea), Radiosperma \ncorbiferum (Celtic Sea and Benguela) and Sigmopollis sp. (NW Africa). These were more \nabundant in both North Sea and Celtic Sea samples.  \nOther organisms occurring are the organic linings of calcareous dinoflagellate cysts, \nthecamoebians (North Sea, Celtic Sea), chrysomonad cysts (North Sea, Celtic Sea) and \ndiatoms. Diatoms can still be present when low concentrations of HF are used, possibly \ncombined with heavy liquid separation, which enhances the abundance of diatoms with low \ndensities (Laboratory 1c; 9; 17). Laboratory 20b has good recovery of diatoms, since the \nsamples are not treated with HF.  \n \n4. Discussion \n \n22 \n \n527 \n528 \n529 \n530 \n531 \n532 \n533 \n534 \n535 \n536 \n537 \n538 \n539 \n540 \n541 \n542 \n543 \n544 \n545 \n546 \n547 \n548 \n549 \n550 \n551 \n4.1.  Is a 300 or 400 dinoflagellate cyst count sufficient to reach reliable diversities and \nabsolute abundances? \n \nThere is no general agreement on the number of cysts which should be counted to obtain \nreliable data for diversity and absolute abundance studies. The majority of palynologists \nusually count 300 cysts per sample, which can provide up to 98% confidence (Germerad et \nal., 1968). To check whether it is necessary to count 300 or 400 dinoflagellate cysts, results \nfrom counting 300 cysts, plus an additional 100 cysts are compared using absolute \nabundances, species diversity and the Shannon-Wiener Index for all samples (Table 3). The \ncomparison shows that the disparities in the results are insignificant: averages of absolute \nabundances, species richness and the Shannon-Wiener Index show limited changes compared \nto the associated standard deviations. The statistical test of Maher (1981) indicates that all \nabsolute abundances derived from the 300 dinoflagellate cyst count statistically produce the \nsame concentration as from the 400 dinoflagellate cyst count. It can thus be concluded that a \n300 dinoflagellate cyst count is sufficient for generating reliable diversities and absolute \nabundance data in Quaternary studies. \n \n4.2. Reproducibility of relative abundances \n \nThe standard deviations of the relative abundances observed in the grouping based on cyst \npreservation are always lower than 11.2%. These relatively small standard deviations suggest \nthat changes in the relative abundance counts are caused by observer bias rather than by \ndifferences in methodology. Indeed, the highest standard deviations in the taxonomical \ngroupings are with the taxa RBC, SBC and Lejeunecysta s.l. and since it can be assumed that \nthe potential for preservation of these taxa is similar, it is likely that the disparities in the \n23 \n \n552 \n553 \n554 \n555 \n556 \n557 \n558 \n559 \n560 \n561 \n562 \n563 \n564 \n565 \n566 \n567 \n568 \n569 \n570 \n571 \n572 \n573 \n574 \n575 \n576 \ncounts are the result of observer bias. The high standard deviation for RBC is probably caused \nby the high numbers of the morphologically similar Dubridinium spp. and the unfamiliarity of \nmany observers with Dubridinium spp. Furthermore, an unambiguous definition of a round \nbrown cyst is still lacking. The same is true for the spiny brown cysts, and several poorly \ndefined species fall within this group. All other standard deviations are lower than 10%, \nwhich we consider an acceptable range for completely independent dinoflagellate cyst counts. \nAnother possible reason for observer bias could be related to the use of different illumination \ntechniques for routine counting of dinoflagellate cysts. Comparison of the use of phase \ncontrast to interference contrast illumination to count dinoflagellate cysts on the same slides \nby Laboratory 15 revealed that phase contrast emphasizes the transparent cysts (Spiniferites \ns.l., Operculodinium s.l., Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus, etc.), whilst interference contrast \nemphasizes the brown heterotrophic cysts (RBC, SBC, etc.). Despite the observer bias, there \nis no doubt that dinoflagellate cyst relative abundance counts by one single observer are \nrepeatable.  \n \n4.3. Explanation of outliers in absolute abundances \n \nThe overestimates can each be explained by examining specific methodologies employed by \nparticular labs. Labs 1a and 1c lost an excessive amount of Lycopodium spores due to the use \nof sieving at 20 \u00b5m as shown by Lignum et al. (2008). Labs 11 and 14 experienced problems \nwith settling after centrifugation and were not confident that the final residues were suitable \nfor quantitative analysis.  \nThe underestimates by Laboratory 22b are due to the use of oxidation, which causes \npreferential destruction of dinoflagellate cysts. Due to the low amounts of material used in the \nexercise, the maceration tank and washing machine method (laboratory 20a and laboratory \n24 \n \n577 \n578 \n579 \n580 \n581 \n582 \n583 \n584 \n585 \n586 \n587 \n588 \n589 \n590 \n591 \n592 \n593 \n594 \n595 \n596 \n597 \n598 \n599 \n600 \n601 \n20b) did not function optimally and yielded atypical resultsthat should not be regarded as \nrepresentative results for the technique. This would be mainly related to cysts getting attached \nto the large filter cloth (25x25 cm) used in this technique (see Discussion, assumption \neight).Furthermore, one of the samples from NW Africa (Laboratory 20b) was separated at \nspecific gravities of 1.8, 2.0 and 2.3 g\/ml. At the specific gravities of 1.8 and 2.3 g\/ml, there \nwere almost no dinoflagellate cysts in the slides, whereas ten times more dinocysts were noted \nat the specific gravity of 2.0 g\/ml. Further investigation needs to be carried out to evaluate the \neffect of heavy liquid separation at different specific gravities. \nFor Laboratory 8, the use of a sonic oscillator resulted in destruction of sensitive cysts, again \nyielding underestimates.  \n \n4.4. Reproducibility and accuracy of absolute abundances, excluding the outliers \n \nTotal cyst count is less dependent on taxonomical expertise, and thus probably less influenced \nby the observer bias. The different laboratories participating in the current inter-calibration \nexercise used different processing techniques(see supplementary data). The reproducibility of \nestimates of absolute cyst abundances, as expressed as coefficient of variation in Table 2,  \nshows that there are quite some differences among the 23 laboratories: the coefficients of \nvariation are relatively large (46\u201358%) and nearly twice as high as the coefficients of \nvariations (20\u201325%) which are calculated from Maher (1981). Our results suggest that the \ndetermination of absolute abundances is mainly dependent on processing methodology. In this \nlight the accuracy also needs to be considered: a better understanding of what is causing the \nvariation can only be achieved when correct absolute abundances of dinoflagellate cysts have \nbeen determined. To estimate whether the absolute abundances give an accurate picture of the \ntrue absolute abundances of the dinoflagellate cysts, results from the marker-grain method are \n25 \n \n602 \n603 \n604 \n605 \n606 \n607 \n608 \n609 \n610 \n611 \n612 \n613 \n614 \n615 \n616 \n617 \n618 \n619 \n620 \n621 \n622 \n623 \n624 \n625 \n626 \ncompared with independent methods. When compared to the volumetric method, absolute \nabundances calculated using the marker-grain method, are 44\u201363 % higher (Table 2). In a \nsimilar study, de Vernal et al. (1987), noted systematically higher concentrations from the \nmarker-grain method compared to the results from the volumetric method, and they suggested \nthat significant losses of Lycopodium spores (close to 33% on the average) took place during \nlabratory procedures. On the other hand, in a study on Paleogene sediments, Heilmann-\nClausen (1985), found marker-grain estimates varying between  70% and 129% of volumetric \nestimates and on average 2% lower concentration was calculated from the marker-grain \nmethod. Our study confirms the observation of de Vernal et al. (1987), and even shows larger \ndeviations. It should also be noted, that counts from strew slides made from unprocessed \nsamples show much lower abundances than the average absolute abundances from the marker \ngrain method. From these observations, it can be concluded that with most preparation \ntechniques there are significant losses of Lycopodium spores, and this is most probably the \nreason for overestimation of the absolute abundances using the marker-grain method. \nFurthermore, there was no evidence of significant loss of dinoflagellate cysts during the \nlabratory preparations, except when oxidation or very long or destructive sonication was used \n(see below). Thus, in order to understand what causes the differences in absolute abundances, \none needs to consider which of the underlying assumptions need to be questioned. Ten \nassumptions need to be considered.  \n1)\u201dDrying samples does not cause decay. \u201c \nAlthough drying is often done in palynological preparation, it should be avoided in organic \nrich sediments, where drying causes formation of selenite (gypsum, CaSO4.2H2O), by \nreaction of calcium carbonate with sulphuric acid, usually derived from pyrite decay. The \nformation of sulphuric acid significantly affects extremely sensitive dinoflagellate cysts. In \nthis case, to calculate the weight of the samples, wet volumes should be used, corrected with \n26 \n \n627 \n628 \n629 \n630 \n631 \n632 \n633 \n634 \n635 \n636 \n637 \n638 \n639 \n640 \n641 \n642 \n643 \n644 \n645 \n646 \n647 \n648 \n649 \n650 \n651 \ndry bulk densities. In our samples, gypsum crystals were not observed. The homogenized \nsamples were oven dried before subdivision into smaller batches and dispatching to individual \nlaboratories. This was done to avoid differential drying. However, not all laboratories \nprocessed the samples exactly at the same time. Samples were dispatched in March 2007, and \nwere processed within the following year. The possibility exists that samples that were \nprocessed at a later stage dried out more. Clustering of amorphous organic matter around the \ncysts seems to occur in more dried out samples (most obvious around Lingulodinium \nmachaerophorum specimens in Plate III), but there were no clear signs that this process \ncaused changes in the assemblage. \n2)\u201dSamples are homogenous.\u201d \n Heterogenous samples processed in a similar way do not give reproducible results. One \nquasi-replica was done by Laboratory 21 (a and b). The only difference in preparation was the \naddition of some soap during sieving (Table 4). Following the test by Maher (1981), for every \nstudied sample, the microfossil concentration in the replicas is the same. It can thus be \nconcluded that the samples are well-mixed and are homogenous. Furthermore, there are few \ndifferences between both samples in terms of relative abundances.  \n3)\u201dA single Lycopodium tablet from batch 483216 contains 18,583 \u00b1 1,708 spores.\u201d \nThis reference is given by the supplier (Lund University), and these numbers were calibrated \nusing a Coulter counter. Lignum et al. (2008) also used a Coulter counter for verification and \nobtained 16,971 \u00b1 1,251 Lycopodium spores. We dissolved one tablet in distilled water and \nsieving on a 0.25 \u00b5m Millipore filter. The filter was cut into two pieces, mounted on a slide \nand counted under a transmitted light microscope. On this filter, 16,993 Lycopodium spores \nwere counted, which falls within the range proposed by the supplier and Lignum et al. (2008). \nA similar exercise has been done for another batch by Stabell and Henningsmoen (1981) \nwhich found similar results. This assumption is thus acceptable.   \n27 \n \n652 \n653 \n654 \n655 \n656 \n657 \n658 \n659 \n660 \n661 \n662 \n663 \n664 \n665 \n666 \n667 \n668 \n669 \n670 \n671 \n672 \n673 \n674 \n675 \n676 \n4) \u201dNo degradation of the palynomorphs occurs caused by chemical treatment such as \noxidation or acid treatments by HF and HCl.\u201d \nSince Lycopodium spores are acetolysed during the manufacturing process, they can \nwithstand this treatment. Effects of chemicals on Lycopodium show that colour changes are \nonly caused by acetolysis or HCl treatment (Sengupta, 1975). On the other hand, it has been \nshown that acetolysis or oxidation selectively destroys the cysts of the Polykrikaceae and \nProtoperidiniaceae (Reid, 1977; Marret, 1993). KOH treatment causes destruction of the \nProtoperidiniaceae after five minutes (de Vernal et al., 1996, and Mertens, pers. observations) \nand causes swelling of the palynomorphs. Likewise, methods using H2O2 (Riding et al., 2007) \nresult in the destruction of protoperidiniacean cysts (Riding, pers. comm., Hopkins and \nMcCarthy, 2002; Mertens, pers. obs.). This has also been demonstrated for Late Cretaceous \nperidinioid dinoflagellate cysts (Schrank, 1988). Oxidation with Schulze\u2019s solution by \nLaboratory 22b resulted in the nearly complete destruction of the RBC, SBC and other \nheterotrophs in all samples, and led to the relative enrichment of resistant pollen and reworked \nnon-peridinioid dinoflagellate cysts. Cold HF and HCl have never been reported to destroy \ndinoflagellate cysts. However, hot rinses with HCl after the HF treatment were particularly \nharmful to recent peridinoid cysts (Dale, 1976). Palynomorphs treated with warm HF clearly \nshowed traces of deterioration: destruction of delicate structures with fragmentation along \nsutures and changes in wall texture with a thickening of the robust structures (Plate I, 11, 16,, \nPlate III, 6). It can be concluded that chemical degradation is minimized when only cold \nhydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid are used.  \n5) \u201dSonication causes no mechanical degradation of the pollen and spores or dinoflagellate \ncysts.\u201d \n The extensive use of ultrasound will not harm any dinoflagellate cysts according to \nFunkhouser and Evitt (1959), however, other authors report differential damage (e.g. \n28 \n \n677 \n678 \n679 \n680 \n681 \n682 \n683 \n684 \n685 \n686 \n687 \n688 \n689 \n690 \n691 \n692 \n693 \n694 \n695 \n696 \n697 \n698 \n699 \n700 \n701 \nHodgkinson, 1991). This has not yet been checked in a quantitative manner for dinoflagellate \ncysts. The use of a sonic oscillator, although dependent of frequency (Marceau, 1969) is \nextremely damaging: the sonication by Laboratory 8 resulted in the destruction of RBC and \nSBC in the Benguela sample (Plate IV, 20). An ultrasonic bath appears relatively harmless, \nunless used for too long, i.e. more than 6 minutes. Laboratory 18a used an ultrasonic bath for \n30 minutes, and this resulted in extensive damage to the cysts. Many cysts were fragmented, \noften with broken or even lost spines and were often clustered (Plate I, 17, Plate III,, 13, Plate \nIV, 11). In addition microforaminiferal linings were often fragmented. \n6) \u201dCentrifuging causes no mechanical degradation of the palynomorphs.\u201d \nNo visible signs were noted that this technique causes degradation of the cysts.  \n7)\u201dSieving causes no loss of palynomorphs.\u201d \nLignum et al. (2008) demonstrated that sieving should be done with a sieve mesh \nwidthsmaller than 15 \u00b5m. Our results confirm this observation. Laboratories using nylon sieve \nwith widths of 20 \u00b5m (Laboratory 1a, 1c) showed extremely high absolute abundances. This \nsuggests that significant losses of Lycopodium spores occurred during the sieving process - \neven larger than the 20% that is proposed by Lignum et al. (2008). No significant loss of cysts \nwas documented in this study.It is possible that cysts of Pentaspharsodinium dalei pass \nthrough 20 \u00b5m sieves, this species was present in such low abundances in the studied samples \nto significantly affect relative or absolute abundances.  \n8) \u201dDecantation causes no loss of palynomorphs.\u201d \nAn experiment was done to determine how many Lycopodium spores were lost during \ndecanting and sieving. One gram of the NW Africa sample together with one Lycopodium \ntablet, was processed with a HCl\/HF\/HCl cycle, followed by sieving on a nylon mesh of 10 \n\u00b5m. After every decantation, the decanted fluid was filtered through a 0.25 \u00b5m Millepore \nfilter. What remained on the filter was counted under a transmitted light microscope. Only \n29 \n \nLycopodium spores were left on the filters, next to some amorphous organic matter (Table 5). \nThe number of spores will be dependent of the size of the filter used. Apparently 24% of the \nLycopodium spores were lost during decanting. This is not surprising, since it is a well-known \nfact that Lycopodium spores have very good floating capacity (e.g. Salter et al., 2002). An \nextra 1.3% was left on the filter and 1% got stuck to handling material (spatula, tube). In the \nslides only 43.4% of the Lycopodium spores were found. An additional 30.2% spores were \nunaccounted for, and could have been lost during sieving and\/or could have been obscured in \nthe slides to some extent. Because we did not expect any significant losses to occur during \nsieving, we did not capture sieved material during this experiment. However, we tested \nsieving a complete Lycopodium tablet on 10 \u00b5m and capturing on a 0.25 \u00b5m sieve. We found \nlosses to be 0.79% when gently pouring the dissolved tablet over the sieve and subsequent \nwashing, 0.97% when using a hand pump to facilitate sieving and 2.01% when using a pipette \ntip. Lignum et al. (2006) recorded losses up to 5.8 \u00b1 1.2 % for 15 \u00b5m meshes. It can thus be \nassumed that only a small part of the missing spores were pushed through the 10 \u00b5m nylon \nsieve. Presumably, by being obscured, spores are often concealed and this plays a more \nsignificant role in explaining the missing amount of spores. Also, it is possible that due to the \ntexture of the exines of Lycopodium spores, the spores get more easily caught in the sieves \nthan smoother palynomorphs. However, this loss can be easily checked by the observer.  \n702 \n703 \n704 \n705 \n706 \n707 \n708 \n709 \n710 \n711 \n712 \n713 \n714 \n715 \n716 \n717 \n718 \n719 \n720 \n721 \n722 \n723 \n724 \n725 \n9)\u201dPre-sieving causes no losses.\u201d \n It is unclear to what extent presieving causes loss of Lycopodium spores, although it is \nevident that it should be avoided in samples from high productivity areas, where high \nproduction of amorphous organic matter forms large clusters in the sediment, which can be \ndiscarded with the large fraction. However; it can be easily checked whether Lycopodium \nspores were lost.  \n30 \n \n10) Heavy liquid separation causes no loss of Lycopodium spores. It has been noted that \ndensity separation with heavy liquids, can cause incorporation of mineral particles modifying \nthe density (de Vernal et al., 1996). Litwin & Traverse (1989) recommend pyrite to be \nremoved prior to density separation.  The results of this study do not show any obvious \ndifficulties with this processing step, although for definite clarity further study is suggested. \n726 \n727 \n728 \n729 \n730 \n731 \n732 \n733 \n734 \n735 \n736 \n737 \n738 \n739 \n740 \n741 \n742 \n743 \n744 \n745 \n746 \n747 \n748 \n749 \n750 \nFrom these considerations it can be concluded that a significant amount of Lycopodium spores \nare lost, mainly during decanting and sieving. There is little evidence that there is loss of \ndinoflagellate cysts during these manipulations.  \n \n4.5. Recommendations \n \nThe exercise demonstrated that relative abundances are reproducible, but underlined the \nurgent need for a taxonomic intercalibration process. Counting 300 dinoflagellate cysts is \nsufficient both in terms of diversity and absolute abundances. Absolute abundance \ncalculations of dinoflagellate cysts are dependent on processing methodology, since \nLycopodium spores are being lost during different processing steps. In this respect, there are \nthree possible choices the Quaternary worker can make: \n \nStandardize methodology for the extraction of dinoflagellate cysts. \n \nSince samples can be reproducible when one fixed methodology is followed (see 4.3), a \nstandard methodology is suggested (Figure 1). We consider that there are critical steps that \nmust be avoided in this standard method when preparing samples for dinoflagellate cyst work: \nthe use of oxidation, KOH, warm acids, acetolysis, mesh sizes larger than 15 \u00b5m, decanting \n(substituted by sieving) and sonication longer than 1 minute. During sieving, care should be \n31 \n \ntaken to avoid Lycopodium spores being forced through the sieve. A certain degree of \nfreedom is allowed in the number of HCl and HF cycles, length of ultrasonication (0-60 \nseconds), duration of sieving and sieve mesh size (6-14 \u00b5m), Care should be taken to \nneutralize HF by diluting at least ten times before sieving. Further studies are required to fine-\ntune the method by focusing on designated issues. \n751 \n752 \n753 \n754 \n755 \n756 \n757 \n758 \n759 \n760 \n761 \n762 \n763 \n764 \n765 \n766 \n767 \n768 \n769 \n770 \n771 \n772 \n773 \n774 \n775 \n \n Adding Lycopodium tablets at the end of processing. \n \nThe marker grain method is based on the assumption that there is no selective loss of fossil \nand exotic pollen during the procedures. However, this assumption has never been checked. \nOur study suggests that  predominantly Lycopodium spores  are lost, and that losses of \ndinoflagellate cysts are negligible. Therefore the addition of Lycopodium tablets at the end of \nthe preparation could be suggested, thus severely limiting the loss of Lycopodium spores. \nHowever, this goes against the well-accepted idea of spiking with an internal standard before \nthe start of preparation. \n \nAlternative methods. \n \nThere are alternative methods that can be used, but it is unknown if these methods  yield \nbetter results. The use of microbeads was introduced by Ogden (1986), but often results in \nmuch higher abundance estimates, apparently because of difficulty in sustaining an even \nsuspension of the particles in the stock solution: the higher specific gravity of microspheres \ncauses them to settle three to four times more rapidly than pollen grains (McCarthy, 1992). \nOther marker-grain methods, such as the Eucalyptus globulus marker-grain method \n(Matthews, 1969), has also been used (e.g. de Vernal et al., 1987). However, it is not known \n32 \n \n776 \n777 \n778 \n779 \n780 \n781 \n782 \n783 \n784 \n785 \n786 \n787 \n788 \n789 \n790 \n791 \n792 \n793 \n794 \n795 \n796 \n797 \n798 \n799 \n800 \nwhether these methods give more reliable results. The aliquot method gives more accurate \nresults than the Lycopodium method in our study, but unfortunately not much is known about \nthe precision of this method.  \n \n5. Conclusions \n \nBased on an interlaboratory comparison, this study proposes a new standard method to \ndetermine absolute abundances of dinoflagellate cysts. Alternatively, Lycopodium tablets can \nbe added at the end of the preparation or an alternative method (e.g. microbeads or aliquot \nmethod) can be used.   \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nAndr\u00e9 Catrijsse (VLIZ) is kindly thanked for providing samples from the North Sea.

It is supposed that one tablet contains 18583 spores, so the % is calculated by \ndividing the number of counted spores by 18583 spores.  \n \n  \n \n1 \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n \nTables \n \nTable 1 \n \nSample Lithology Dry weight \n(g)  \nNumber of \ntablets added \n# spores added Stdev spores \nNorth Sea Fine-medium sand 10 3 55749 2959 \nCeltic Sea Fine silty sand 10 1 18583 1708 \nNW Africa Clay 2 2 37166 2416 \nBenguela Clay 1 4 74332 3417 \n6 \n7 \n \n2 \n \n1 \n2 \nTable 2 \n \nSpecies name North Sea Celtic Sea NW Africa Benguela \nRound brown cysts (RBC) \nSpiny brown cysts (SBC) \ncysts of Alexandrium spp. \ncysts of Gymnodinium spp. \nStelladinium spp. \nLejeunecysta spp. \nSelenopemphix spp. \nTuberculodinium vancampoae \nPolykrikos spp. \nXandarodinium xanthum \nDalella chathamense \n \nExtremely sensitive cysts (total) \n \nLingulodinium machaerophorum \nOperculodinium spp. \nPyxidininopsis reticulata \nSpiniferites spp. \nQuinquecuspis concreta \nTrinovantedinium applanatum \nVotadinium spp. \n \nModerately sensitive cysts (total) \n \nNematosphaeropsis labyrinthus \n Impagidinium spp. \nOperculodinium israelianum \nPentapharsodinium dalei \nPolysphaeridium zoharyi \nAtaxiodinium choane \nBitectatodinium spp. \n \nResistant cysts (total) \n \n35.8 \u00b1 16.0 \n15.5 \u00b1 12.5 \n0.2 \u00b1 0.3 \n0.3 \u00b1 0.6 \n0.3 \u00b1 0.3 \n9.5 \u00b1 12.0 \n5.5 \u00b1 1.7 \n0.0 \u00b1 0.1 \n6.9 \u00b1 3.5 \n0.2 \u00b1 0.3 \n- \n \n74.3 \u00b1 7.4 \n \n1.5 \u00b1 2.5 \n2.8 \u00b1 1.9 \n0.0 \u00b1 0.2 \n9.8 \u00b1 3.5 \n3.3 \u00b1 2.1 \n0.2 \u00b1 0.4 \n5.8 \u00b1 6.6 \n \n23.6 \u00b1 7.2 \n \n0.0 \u00b1 0.1 \n0.3 \u00b1 0.6 \n0.2 \u00b1 0.2 \n0.4 \u00b1 0.5 \n0.4 \u00b1 0.6 \n0.0 \u00b1 0.1 \n0.6 \u00b1 1.1 \n \n0.5 \u00b1 0.6 \n \n10.0 \u00b1 7.7 \n1.7 \u00b1 3.3 \n0.5 \u00b1 0.9 \n0.3 \u00b1 0.6 \n0.2 \u00b1 0.2 \n1.5 \u00b1 1.6 \n4.8 \u00b1 2.1 \n- \n5.7 \u00b1 3.8 \n0.1 \u00b1 0.1 \n- \n \n24.8 \u00b1 11.2 \n \n0.7 \u00b1 0.9 \n12.3 \u00b1 3.7 \n- \n51.8 \u00b1 10.7 \n2.3 \u00b1 2.0 \n1.2 \u00b1 1.0 \n0.5 \u00b1 0.7 \n \n68.9 \u00b1 10.7 \n \n0.0 \u00b1 0.1 \n0.15 \u00b1 0.3 \n0.0 \u00b1 0.1 \n2.6 \u00b1 3.5 \n0.1 \u00b1 0.3 \n0.1 \u00b1 0.1 \n3.3 \u00b1 2.0 \n \n6.2 \u00b1 3.8 \n3.4 \u00b1 2.3 \n2.3 \u00b1 2.4 \n- \n0.0 \u00b1 0.1 \n0.3 \u00b1 0.3 \n0.4 \u00b1 0.5 \n1.0 \u00b1 0.6 \n0.1 \u00b1 0.3 \n1.2 \u00b1 0.8 \n0.1 \u00b1 0.2 \n- \n \n15.4 \u00b1 8.2 \n \n86.2 \u00b1 4.7 \n0.5 \u00b1 0.7 \n- \n3.3 \u00b1 1.1 \n0.1 \u00b1 0.1 \n0.2 \u00b1 0.3 \n0.0 \u00b1 0.1 \n \n90.3 \u00b1 4.2 \n \n0.1 \u00b1 0.1 \n0.0 \u00b1 0.1 \n0.4 \u00b1 0.7 \n0.0 \u00b1 0.1 \n0.1 \u00b1 0.5 \n0.0 \u00b1 0.0 \n0.1 \u00b1 0.2 \n \n0.7 \u00b1 0.9 \n62.7 \u00b1 17.0 \n8.5 \u00b1 8.5 \n0.1 \u00b1 0.5 \n0.0 \u00b1 0.1 \n0.1 \u00b1 0.4 \n1.4 \u00b1 1.6 \n6.5 \u00b1 6.3 \n0.0 \u00b1 0.1  \n1.1 \u00b1 0.8 \n0.0 \u00b1 0.1 \n0.0 \u00b1 0.1 \n \n80.6 \u00b1 9.9 \n \n0.2 \u00b1 0.5 \n8.4 \u00b1 6.6 \n- \n5.5 \u00b1 3.2 \n1.0 \u00b1 1.5 \n0.3 \u00b1 0.4 \n0.7 \u00b1 0.7 \n \n16.2 \u00b1 9.7 \n \n2.1 \u00b1 2.0 \n0.0 \u00b1 0.1 \n0.4 \u00b1 0.7 \n0.2 \u00b1 0.5 \n0.2 \u00b1 0.7 \n- \n0.2 \u00b1 0.6 \n \n3.1 \u00b1 2.5 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n  \n \n3 \n \n4 \n \n1 \n2 \nTable 3\u00a0\n \nMethod Variable \/ sample North Sea Celtic sea NW Africa Benguela \nMarker grain \nmethod \nAverage (cysts\/g) 1516 2583 19441 144299 \n St dev (cysts\/g) 698 1342 9148 84159 \n \n \nCoefficient of variation (%) 46 52 47 58 \n Coefficient of variation (%) Maher (1981) 20 25 23 21 \nVolumetric method Average (cysts\/g)  1163 10796 53200 \n St dev (cysts\/g)  5 1137 0 \n \n \nCoefficient of variation (%)  0 11 0 \nDifference Cysts\/g -
