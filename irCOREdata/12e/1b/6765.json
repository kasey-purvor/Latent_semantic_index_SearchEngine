This discussion is set within current trends in higher education.\nIntroduction\nEnabling students to make effective use of study opportunities is an increasingly important\nelement in consideration of university resource provision. Universities are expected to\nidentify the added value which higher education represents, both to public funding bodies\nand to clients, whether students, parents or employers. Maximizing study potential can\nfacilitate, as well as demonstrate, the added value which higher education offers. Quality\nassurance processes have also increased the focus on the climate and provision of support for\nstudy. And in a more robust climate of competition, provision of study-enhancing measures\nmay be part of an institutional profile which will attract students of the best quality.\nInformation Technology is recognized as a key study-enhancement measure, and there is\nincreasing demand, from both students themselves and from their subject departments, for\nprovision of basic IT awareness and skills. The main reasons for this are the perceptions\nthat IT skills can enhance both the student's study effectiveness and ability to participate in\nsubject activities, and that general IT confidence is a factor in a student's potential value to\nemployers. This paper will consider one form of response to the demand.\n70\nALT-] Volume 5 Number I\nIT and study enhancement in higher education\nAwareness of a possible need for 'computer literacy' in higher education is not a new one.\nDuring the 1960s, mainframe computers became well-established in universities, carrying\nout a variety of functions, and concerns about undergraduate preparation for computer use\nculminated in the Barnard Report of 1970 with its emphatic central recommendation: 'We\nhave no hesitation [. ..] in advising that all undergraduates should be taught computing'\n(UGC\/CBURC, 1970, p. 5). Yet as an endorsement of computer literacy, Barnard made\nlittle practical impact. McDonough suggests some of the reasons:\nThe main reason was lack of finance, though there were other important causes.\nMainframe computing was not ideally suited to undergraduate use with its demand for\nlarge numbers of simultaneously active terminals. The lack of educational software was\na major disincentive in humanities departments in the University. The lack of experience\nof many members of staff in these departments in using computers was also a major\nobstacle. (McDonough, 1986,113)\nNeither the mass access to computing which the microcomputer was to offer, nor the\nplethora of easily-used and powerful applications programs currently taken for granted,\nwere available, so that computer literacy in practice meant simple computer science plus\ncomputer programming - not an easy package to offer (especially as it included a\nsubstantial time commitment) to undergraduates or their teachers.\nIt is only over the last decade that IT has become a major element in the general study\nenvironment in higher education. First, it has become a powerful personal tool. Thus, word-\nprocessing of study-related documents is now common enough to be taken for granted, and\nin many courses has been made compulsory. Second, the elaboration of networks, which has\nenabled email to become a routine facility, has also provided the ability to access data from\ndistant sources. Most students now consult university library catalogues electronically; many\naccess local course material; a growing number search for material on the World Wide Web,\nor download files from other sources. Third, CAL has become a normal part of the study\nmaterial available to the student. Significant here are initiatives such as TLTP (in the UK)\nand technical developments such as authoring systems and multimedia environments. And\nfourth, easily usable computers bearing relevant software are widely available to students,\nwith a growing proportion of the student body owning a computer.\nFor the past decade, the focus of cross-curricular IT in higher education has tended to be\non CAL, and much has taken place in this area. Provision of basic IT capabilities has\ntended to occur within subject departments. However, this results in an inevitable variation\nacross the university, both in terms of the level and breadth of IT capabilities addressed,\nand hardware and software used. And a focus on departmental IT requirements can result\nin provision which is narrowly based and may overlook basic competences, such as\nmanaging files or copying data between applications, or to a recipe approach where\nstudents can implement a list of button-clicks but have no mental map of the system they\nare using. For departments which provide a general grounding in IT, there is a heavy price\nto pay in terms of resource provision. This sometimes results in expensive anomalies where\nsenior staff spend hours teaching students the simplest features of computer use.\nIn a small number of institutions, notable achievements were made in student IT\n71\nAllan Martin and Debra Fayter Cross-curricular IT tools for university students: developing an effective model\npreparation in the 1980s. For instance, at Exeter University the Pallas project was\nestablished in 1984, with CTI funding, to provide computer training and support in the\nFaculty of Arts, and has continued to develop since then (Buckett, 1985,1991; Dobson and\nKinrade, 1990). At Glasgow University, the DISH project was established in 1985, also\nwith CTI funding, based on a consortium of the University's History departments\n(Trainor, 1986, 1988). In Durham University, a Computer Literacy Programme was\nestablished, with Enterprise in Higher Education funding (later from TLTP), to operate\nacross the whole University (McCartan, 1990; Preece and Adcock, 1990).\nA growing number of institutions have become aware that they need an IT strategy\nenvisaging not only a university-wide computing environment (i.e. hardware and\nsoftware), but also a university-wide approach to IT preparation of students, especially in\nrespect of generic IT tools which they may employ irrespective of departmental affiliation.\nGeneric IT preparation removes the burden of basic tuition from departmental staff while\nenabling them to focus on'providing the additional IT requirements specific to study within\nthe department. This approach is feasible because it is now possible to focus on generic\ntools rather than on Computer Science Made Simple, a characteristic of earlier approaches\nto 'computer literacy' which could give courses the appearance of unrelated bolt-on\nadditions to subject modules (see, for example, Gardner, 1990).\nContexts of provision\nThe authors of this paper have been involved in providing cross-curricular IT preparation\nprogrammes for the last two years at the Universities of Glasgow and York respectively.\nComparison of our experiences suggests that the following areas are central to discussion\nof the effectiveness of IT or Information Skills preparation programmes:\nPolicy context\nIn what policy environment do programmes develop?\nThe Glasgow programme arose directly out of the University's IT Strategy development.\nIncluded in the strategy document, approved in the Spring of 1993, was provision for a\n'University-wide Introductory Course in IT' for undergraduates. The ILIAD (Information\nLiteracy in All Departments) at York was soon linked into the University's IT Policy.\nHodgson et al (1995, 79-85) identify three approaches to IT-skills provision: localized,\nwhere isolated courses are available in a variety of places and forms; institutional, where a\ncomputer literacy programme is available centrally for all students; and integrated, where\nIT-skills provision is integrated into degree courses. Institutional commitment is required\nfor the two latter approaches, and both York and Glasgow display elements of both: the\nprovision is centrally funded and organized, but is integrated, to degrees chosen by\ndepartments, into the curriculum.\nResource context\nWhat resources are available and how are they provided?\nResource levels will determine the extent of the programme. At York, 500 students will pass\nthrough the programme in the current academic year (1996-7), while at Glasgow\nsomething over 4,000 are expected, building up from 700 in 1994-5 and 2,800 in 1995-6.\nResourcing in terms of staff, finance and equipment may be provided centrally, as in\n72\nALT-] Volume 5 Number I\nGlasgow and York, or devolved to departments. External resourcing may also be sought\nthrough sponsorship (as at York) or project funding (as, for instance, at Durham). We\nwould suggest that central funding is most likely to produce an IT-literate student body.\nDevolved resource control may result in a legitimate focus on the limited range of IT\ncompetences needed for successful completion of modules offered by a department and\nperpetuate differentiation of IT competence across the university. Centralized funding at\nGlasgow has enabled the integrity of a broadly-based (in IT terms) course to be\nmaintained; indeed, the broad base of the course has generally been supported by\ndepartments. Their attitudes might have been different if departmental funds had to be\nhanded over directly for IT courses, rather than indirectly through the top-slicing\nmechanism.\nProgramme context\nHow broadly conceived are the aims of the programmes? Do they focus on mastering\nparticular applications, or are they related to students' study requirements?\nThe latter has been the case both at York and Glasgow and, we would suggest, is the\napproach likely to be most successful. The central feature of the Glasgow programme is the\nIT Baseline, a group of generic competences which are set as an expectation for all students\nto achieve across the University, and which are seen as a broad base both for students' own\nstudy activities and for subject-focused IT-based work within departments. At York, the\nILIAD programme sets IT within the context of information-handling skills.\nDo programmes make provision for students with differing levels of existing IT\ncompetence?\nAt Glasgow initial courses address three levels of existing competence, but for each the\nintended outcome is the Baseline package of competences. At York a customized\nprogramme for Science students has been developed to take account of prior knowledge.\nCurricular context\nAre programmes limited to generic IT skills (as at Glasgow and York) or do they overlap\nwith IT provision within departments or with degree modules with significant IT content?\nAre generic IT course units integrated within subject curricula?\nAt Glasgow several levels of integration are possible, ranging from a course offered on a\nvoluntary basis to any student outside his or her subjects studied, to the same course\noffered as an integral and compulsory part of a subject module. There are assessment\nimplications here, since fully integrated units may carry weight in module assessment.\nDelivery context\nHow are course units delivered? Are they taught (as at Glasgow and York), or delivered\nthrough self-study packages, as is the case at many institutions. Is a distance-learning mode\navailable?\nWe would suggest that a taught course is most appropriate for the majority of students who\nrequire IT preparation, but that for those who are already confident with IT, a non-taught\nroute may be suitable. The current expansion in distance learning raises questions in this\narea, particularly whether mixed-mode or distance-only courses can be developed.\nHow are course units assessed?\n73\nAllan Martin and Debra Fayter Cross-curriailar IT tools for university students: developing an effective model\nOur experience would indicate that the most effective assessment plan in this area is one\nwhich includes both assessed tasks within the IT course and tasks related to students'\nsubject studies.\nIs there a form of certification?\nAt Glasgow and York the provision of a locally-based certificate clearly stating what has\nbeen achieved has been found to be a worthwhile incentive or bonus to many students.\nThere is little demand for this to be tied into national structures.\nImplications\nA number of significant issues are raised by the introduction of IT preparation\nprogrammes:\nInstitutional policy\nConsidering an IT preparation programme poses the question of whether the institution\nhas an IT strategy, and what model of student-IT needs underlies it. As Hodgson et al\n(1995, 85) show, on the basis of a survey of several institutions, and as our own experience\nconfirms, appropriate decision-making at this level is crucial. A generic student\npreparation programme has so many implications that it can be carried forward effectively\nonly as a central element of institutional policy.\nCompulsory FT preparation\nIs there a case for compulsory IT preparation of students, coupled perhaps with assessment\nof IT capabilities on entry to university?\nThis would seem the most comprehensive way of achieving an IT-literate student population,\nbut it involves both will and resource commitment. At Glasgow and York, a large number of\ndepartments are prepared to require achievement of the IT Baseline from first-year students,\nand this requirement may in the future be enforced by some faculties. The resource issue is\nclosely linked, since increasing the numbers of IT-literate students, and raising the\nexpectation by departments of IT use by students, implies the provision of sufficient IT\nresources to satisfy demand. This issue, and its implications, have still to be fully grasped.\nStudy skills\nOffering an IT preparation programme raises the broader issue of study-skills preparation\nfor those students who need them. The ILIAD programme at York includes study-skills\nelements, and at Glasgow it is possible to take a course unit integrating IT with basic study\nskills. But in both York and Glasgow there is an emphasis on selecting appropriate IT tools\nfor study tasks, rather than on technical competence alone. This in turn raises the issue of\nthe locus of provision of such courses. It seems anomalous for courses focused on student\nstudy needs, IT or otherwise, to be offered by university computing services. At York, the\nprogramme is offered in collaboration with the University Library; at Glasgow, by the\nUniversity's IT Office, which is responsible for IT strategy across the University. However,\none could suggest that the most appropriate locus might be a special unit focused on\nstudent preparation for study.\nStaff development\nThere are major staff development issues in providing large-scale IT literacy programmes.\n74\nALT-J Volume 5 Number I\nStaff need to be made aware of, and empowered to deal with, the increased range of\nteaching strategies which student IT literacy enables, and also of the expectations which IT-\nliterate students may have of staff. While TLTP has been very significant in introducing\nboth awareness of and opportunities for developing CAL material for use within teaching,\nand while many institutions have CAL development and support units, developing general\nstaff awareness and routine usage of IT is a much more difficult question, which still has to\nbe seriously grasped, since it involves both the provision of resources and education, and\nthe sponsoring of an element of culture change.\nStandardization\nA university-wide programme raises the question of standardization of hardware and\nsoftware environments across the university, and of providing students with a uniform\nbasic IT capability and attitude. In a situation of increasing modularization, a requirement\nfor standardized prerequisites for study becomes very important. Should this extend\nbeyond individual universities? Within institutions, despite the current drift towards\ndevolved control of resource provision, provision of cross-curricular basic competences\nmay be an area in which provision, and funding, should be retained centrally.\nEvaluation\nIt is important that IT preparation programmes can be shown to be addressing\ninstitutional aims and to be contributing to the overall effectiveness of the institution.\nAppropriate evaluation will indicate the areas of success of the programme, and will assist\npolicy development at departmental and institutional levels.\nTrends\nOur observations seem to suggest three broad trends in higher education. First, there is an\nongoing culture change as the implications of IT for teaching, for learning and for study\nempowerment are adopted into day-to-day practice, and modify what is taken for granted\nby both students and staff. Second, we are moving towards a situation in which universal\nIT competence will be a normal expectation of students, and provision will be made for all\nwho do not display the competences and qualities deemed to be the basis for study\neffectiveness. And third, there may well be a limited number of effective models of such\nprovision; we have been struck by the extent to which the programmes at York and\nGlasgow, initiated independently, were already converging by the time contact was made\nbetween the two.\nThe programmes at York and Glasgow will continue to develop, and we will report at a\nfuture date on their outcomes and on the implications for teaching and learning practices\nand environments, and institutional policies. In so doing we will discuss at greater length\nthan has been possible here the issues which arise from offering such programmes, the\nimplications following therefrom, and the general directions in which higher education is\nmoving.\nReferences\nBuckett, J.
