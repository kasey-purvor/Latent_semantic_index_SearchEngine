Here we review the existing \ncapability for combined modelling of tides, surges and waves, their interactions and the \ndevelopment of coupled models. \n \n1. Introduction \n \nCoastal flooding is generally caused by a combination of high water levels, which may be \ncaused by tides and storm surges, together with waves, which can lead to overtopping of \ncoastal defenses and inundation of low-lying areas, potentially causing damage to life and \nproperty. Waves and storm surges are caused by storm events with high winds blowing \nover the adjacent sea. In some areas such as deltas and estuaries, precipitation and river \nflow may also contribute to coastal flooding. Tsunamis, caused by undersea earthquakes, \nlandslides, volcanic eruptions and meteorites can also be important in causing coastal \nflooding in some areas of the world, notably the islands of the Pacific Rim (Abe, 1979). \nTsunamis are waves of similar wavelength to tides and can be predicted using the shallow \nwater wave equations. NW Europe is much less susceptable to tsunamis although \nHorsburgh et al (2008) examined the potential for an earthquake similar to that in Lisbon \nin 1755 to generate a tsunami and there are some similarities in modelling the \npropagation of a tsunami to modelling other waves and tides; however tsunamis will not \nbe considered further here. \n \nThe storm surge is the meteorologically-driven component of water level driven by \nsynoptic variations of atmospheric pressure and wind. If the storm surge is combined \nwith tide, the combined water level may be known as the \u2018storm tide\u2019 or sometimes the \n\u2018still water level\u2019 since changes occur over periods of hours to days, compared to typical \nwave periods of 1-20s. Wave overtopping occurs when individual wave crests exceed the \n 2\navailable \u2018freeboard\u2019 (height above still water level) of the coastal defences causing \nfurther flooding beyond that due to the surge. See Pullen et al. (2007) for the coastal \nengineering approach to overtopping. The impact of waves at the coast also includes \nbreaking and run-up on beaches and foreshores which can cause coastal erosion \ndepending on the configuration of the coast and the supply of mobile sediment. \n \nThere is an increased risk of devastation due to socio-economic factors as the flood-risk \nareas (coastal and flood plains) with fertile soil and access to communications are \ngenerally densely populated: many cities develop at the coast. and coastal property may \nbe very valuable (Hinton et al., 2007). Driven by projected increases of sea levels, more \nintense rainfall, and stronger wind speeds, flood risks are anticipated to increase in the \nfuture (Hall et al., 2007). Coastal flood defences have been built in some areas to protect \nhousing, businesses or infrastructure and emphasis is increasingly being focussed on their \nsustainability in the light of future sea level rise (SLR) e.g. Pye and Blott (2006). In the \nNetherlands, where two-thirds of the country is below storm surge level, large rural areas \nmay presently be defended to a return period of 1:10,000 years, with less densely \npopulated areas protected to 1:4,000 years. In the United Kingdom, where low-lying \nareas are much smaller, e.g. the Norfolk coast of the southern North Sea or the Thames \nEstuary, new residential developments are required to be defended to the 1:200 year \nreturn period of flood level. Waves combined with higher water levels may overtop or \npossibly breach hard or soft coastal defences (seawalls, revetments or dunes) which can \ncause persistent flooding by trapping the water, potentially damaging or destroying \ndefences, coastal structures and property and causing coastal erosion.  \n \nThe basic theory of the generation of storm surges and waves by wind is understood in \nprinciple (Gill, 1982) although some details still need elucidation. For example the wind-\nstress is modelled empirically very successfully although the actual process of transfer of \nmomentum and energy from the atmosphere to the sea via wind waves is very complex \nand not fully understood (Janssen, 2004). There are also several interactions between the \nmean circulation and wind-waves (Peregrine and Jonsson, 1983). The propagation of \nwaves in shallow water is dependent on water depth and this means that the total water \ndepth, which includes tide and surge, will affect wave propagation. In fact the tidal \npropagation is also modified in the presence of a surge, leading to tide-surge interaction \n(Wolf, 1981; Horsburgh and Wilson, 2007). Waves are modified by the presence of \ncurrents generated by tide and surge. They contribute to water level and mean circulation \nthrough wave setup and longshore currents, due to radiation stresses in shallow water \n(Longuet-Higgins and Stewart, 1962). \n \nThis paper presents a review of some recent work on coastal flooding due to storm surges \nand waves with the focus especially on coupled wave-tide-surge modelling. Coastal \nimpacts are discussed with examples from various parts of the world. The development of \ntide-surge and wave models is briefly mentioned, followed by a discussion of the \ninteraction processes. The state of the art in operational oceanography is illustrated, \nmainly with reference to the UK. Wave and tide-surge models have been running in \ndifferent national centres for many years but it is only recently that fully-coupled models \nare becoming available. This is partly due to the fact that tide-surge models, especially in \n 3\n2D, are quite cheap and quick to run whereas the state-of-the art 3rd-generation spectral \nwave models require more computer resources.  Finally we examine some likely future \ndevelopments and gaps in the knowledge. \n  \n2. Impacts of Coastal Flooding \n \nThe costs of coastal flooding can run to many lives and very large losses of property. In \nthe southern North Sea, the 1953 storm surge cost over 2000 lives (Gerritsen, 2005) and \nprompted much research, leading to the development of the Storm Tide Forecasting \nService (STFS) and the building of the Thames Barrier in the UK (Wolf and Flather, \n2005). The tide-surge model is now run operationally at the UK Met Office and many \nother countries around the North Sea now have national storm surge forecasting as \nreviewed by Flather (2000). The regular depressions passing over the NW European \ncontinental shelf in winter from the Atlantic cause storm surges and waves in the shallow \nsea areas. Wind stress is particularly effective in piling up water against the coast in the \nshallow water of the continental shelf as the effect is inversely proportional to water \ndepth. Depths in the southern North Sea and the eastern Irish Sea are only about 40m on \naverage. The UK, in common with many other countries, has assets worth billions of \npounds at risk from coastal floods, river floods, and coastal erosion (Wolf, 2008). \n \nTropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons) are smaller and more intense than mid-\nlatitude depressions and more difficult to predict in atmospheric models since higher \nresolution is required (Emanuel et al., 2008). Their impact at the coast can be even more \ndevastating, especially if they make landfall in areas of high population density. Winds, \ncoastal surge and waves (including wave setup) can all contribute to their destructive \npower. In one of the most recent global catastrophes the low-lying delta of the Irrawaddy \nwas flooded by a storm surge caused by Cyclone Nargis in May 2008 (see Figure 1). This \narea had a high population of people with few resources and little ability to evacuate. The \ntotal number of people dead or missing exceeds 130,000 as of June 2008. In this case the \ndestructive power of waves could only exacerbate the huge losses of property due to \ninundation. The death toll includes those further inland, due to wind and rainfall as well \nas those affected by coastal flooding. The following paragraphs describe some studies of \ntropical cyclones in recent years. Numerical models have often been used in diagnostic \nhindcast studies; in a later section we discuss the potential for forecasting of the impacts \nin operational modelling systems. \n \nIn the United States of America, the city of New Orleans is still recovering from \nHurricane Katrina in 2005. Hurricane Katrina was the most costly and one of the five \ndeadliest hurricanes in the history of the United States. It was the sixth-strongest Atlantic \nhurricane ever recorded and the third-strongest on record to make landfall in the United \nStates. The most severe loss of life and damage to property occurred in New Orleans, \nLouisiana, which was flooded as the levee system catastrophically failed, in many cases \nhours after the storm had moved inland. Post-Katrina many lessons may still have to be \nlearned about coastal development and protection (United States Congress, 2006).  \n \n 4\nIn a study by Wang et al. (2006), Ivan, a strong Category 4 hurricane (downgraded to a \nCategory 3 at landfall), caused widespread erosion and overtopping along the \nnorthwestern Florida barrier-island beaches, within 100 km from the storm centre at \nlandfall. Significant beach and dune erosion was measured as far as 300 km east of the \nstorm centre. The highest elevation of beach erosion extended considerably above the \nmeasured storm-surge level, indicating that storm-wave setup and swash run-up played \nsignificant roles in controlling the elevation of beach erosion. In another study Zhang et \nal. (2005) studied beach erosion due to Hurricane Floyd in 1999 using LIDAR surveys to \nestimate the areas of erosion, showing how new technology can vastly improve our \nability to quantify impacts. Chen et al. (2007) studied the impact on coastal highways \nwhich are important for evacuation in severe weather. There are more than 60,000 miles \n(96,500 km) of coastal roadways in the 100-year floodplain in the United States and \nvulnerable to the attacks of water surges and storm waves generated by hurricanes. The \nadvanced storm surge and circulation model ADCIRC (ADvanced CIRCulation; Luettich \net al., 1992; Westerink et al., 1994a; b) was used for surge modeling either forced directly \nby wind or using water levels from coastal tide gauges. The waves were modelled with \nthe open-source, third-generation spectral wave prediction model SWAN (Simulation of \nWAves in Nearshore areas; Booij et al., 1999; Ris et al., 1999). At the time of writing the \n2008 Atlantic hurricane season is an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone \nformation. The season officially started on June 1 and will run through till November 30. \nThese dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones \nform in the Atlantic basin. This year the season began slightly early when Tropical Storm \nArthur formed off the coast of Belize on May 30. The season has been far more active \nthan normal and has been particularly devastating for Haiti, where hundreds of people \nwere killed by four consecutive tropical cyclones (Fay, Gustav, Hanna, and Ike) in \nAugust and September. The season has also been very destructive, with over US$50 \nbillion in damage so far, mostly in the U.S. Hurricane Ike has been the most destructive \nstorm this year so far, making landfall near Galveston, Texas at category 2 intensity and \ncausing a particularly devastating storm surge due to its large size. \n \nIn Taiwan typhoon Doug almost completely destroyed the breakwaters and docking \nfacilities in the Lungtung harbor at the northeast tip of Taiwan in 1994 (Wang et al., \n2005). The estimated maximum sea level rise was about 3m. Their model results indicate \nthat sea levels reached a maximum of about 2 m at the peak of the storm. The largest \nsurge, however, does not occur at the location where the most severe damage was \nlocated, which suggests that the wave run-up could be an important contribution to the \nstorm surge. \n \nRecently, Kumar et al (2008) carried out a simulation of storm surge for the Andaman \nIslands in the Indian Ocean using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model MIKE 21 \nfrom the Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI, 2002). Madsen and Jakobsen (2004) discussed \nthe merits of MIKE 21 model in reproducing the sea-level heights associated with the \n1991 Bangladesh storm surge, which caused the deaths of about 140,000 people. \n \nSevere storms and cyclones contribute 29 per cent of the total damage cost from natural \nhazards in Australia. In 1999 prices, this amounted to $40 billion during the period 1967 \n 5\nto 1999 (including the cost of deaths and injuries: Nott, 2006). Tropical cyclones also \ncause substantial erosion of the coast e.g. coast of Northern Australia. The combination \nof surge, tide, wave set-up, waves and wave run-up can overtop aeolian coastal dunes or \nridges where they are unconsolidated, causing them to be eroded vertically and removed. \nAt times, this can result in the deposition of sand sheets that extend inland for several \nhundreds of meters and taper in thickness landward. \n \nReturning to mid-latitude storms, a cyclone (known as Gudrun in the Nordic countries) \ndeveloped over the North Atlantic and traveled over the British Isles, Scandinavia, and \nFinland on January 7\u20139, 2005, as reported by T\u00f6nisson et al (2008). This cyclone \ngenerated strong SW\u2013W winds which created a record high storm surge (275 cm) in \nP\u00e4rnu, Estonia, as well as in many other locations along the west Estonian coast. The \nJanuary storm caused changes in the development of shores and the dynamics of beach \nsediments over almost all of Estonia. The largest changes occurred in areas most exposed \nto the storm winds and waves. This storm caused significantly larger changes to the \ndepositional shores in west Estonia than the cumulative effects of ordinary storms over \nthe preceding 10\u201315-year period due to of the absence of protecting ice cover in the sea \nand relatively high sea level for a long period before the storm. \n \nOn 11-12 January 2005 a severe storm hit the Outer Hebrides off NW Scotland with \nwinds exceeding 20 ms-1 and there was flooding on the islands of South Uist and Barra, \ncaused by storm surge and waves. Five lives were lost in one family as they attempted to \ncross the causeway linking North and South Uist in two cars. The surge reached over 1m \nat the nearby port of Stornoway, where regular storm tide forecasts are available. A suite \nof nested wave models was used to run a hindcast of this event. The local wave setup was \ncalculated using the SWAN model and was very high locally to South Uist (over 0.48m) \ndue to the very high waves entering the rapidly shoaling water near-shore (Wolf, 2007). \nFrom Figure 2 it may be seen that the wave heights reached 14.3 m close inshore. The \nwave setup for the Sea of the Hebrides is shown in Fig. 3. Thus this is a case where the \nwaves may have contributed substantially to the total water level as well as their direct \nimpact and overtopping of the causeway. \n \n \n3. Tide-surge modelling \n \nTides, caused by the gravitational effect of sun and moon, are periodic and very \npredictable. They are large on the NW European shelf but small in the Mediterranean. \nThe world\u2019s maximum tidal range can reach 16m in the Bay of Fundy in Canada, where \nthere is near-resonance with the dominant lunar semi-diurnal tidal period. The 2nd largest \ntides (>14m) are found on the NW European Shelf in the Severn Estuary, which is also \nclose to resonance. Surges, on the other hand, are quasi-periodic and caused by \nmeteorological forcing. The most important mechanism for surge generation is wind \nstress acting over shallow water. Surges at the coast are produced by Ekman dynamics, \nbehaving as forced Kelvin waves (Gill, 1982). The size of the surge is proportional to the \nwind-stress divided by the water depth. The wind-stress is usually taken to be \nproportional to the square of the wind-speed with a drag coefficient which increases with \n 6\nwind speed (accounting for some effect of surface roughness due to waves (Brown and \nWolf, in preparation). Due to transient effects there is also an increase in surge height \nwith wind duration. Surges are, therefore, largest where storms impact on large areas of \nshallow continental shelves. In deep water, surge elevations are approximately \nhydrostatic with a 1hPa decrease in atmospheric pressure giving about 1 cm increase in \nsurge elevation (Flather, 2000). Surges in the Mediterranean as a whole are likely to be \nmuch lower due to the much deeper water. However they are important in local areas of \nshallow water e.g. the Northern Adriatic, where Venice is susceptible to flooding. Some \nmodification is caused by seiching, when winds trigger oscillations at the natural periods \nof enclosed sea areas, e.g. in the Adriatic the wind tends to trigger the 22-hour seiche \n(Gill, 1982) and its harmonics (11-hour and 7-hour oscillations). \n \nBarotropic tides and surges are generally modelled using the \u2018shallow-water equations\u2019 \nsince they have very long wavelength (hundreds of kilometers) compared to the water \ndepth (Gill, 1982). Heaps (1983), Flather (1981) and Pugh (1987) reviewed earlier work \non numerical modelling of storm surges. Limited area models are subject to errors in \nboundary conditions and tidal models may omit some tidal frequencies, local effects of \nthe tide-generating forces and load tide response of the solid Earth. Shum et al. (1997) \nreviewed ocean tidal models, concluding that all the models agree within 2-3 cm in the \ndeep ocean. However, tidal models are still inferior to harmonic analysis and prediction \nfor shallow water tides at locations where coastal tide gauge data are available. The tide-\nsurge model predictions reflect this in using the model surge with harmonic predictions \nfor tides to provide the total water level (Flather and Williams, 2004). \n \nIt has long been recognised that in shallow water areas with a large tidal range, the \nnonlinear effects of tide-surge interaction are important. The peak of the surge in the \nsouthern North Sea tends to \u2018avoid\u2019 predicted tidal high water, due to the speeding up of \nthe tidal wave propagation in the presence of the deeper water caused by the surge level \nand other subtle changes are caused by bottom friction. Prandle and Wolf (1978), Wolf \n(1981), Davies and Lawrence (1994), Jones and Davies (1998), Horsburgh and Wilson \n(2007) have described work on the effects of tide-surge interaction. Fig. 4 illustrates the \nmechanism by which tide-surge interaction leads to a surge peak on the rising tide. The \ntidal phase is advanced due to the deeper water caused by the presence of a positive surge \nlevel. The difference between the phase-shifted (T\u2019) and undisturbed tide (T) is added to \nthe surge to give the net tidal residual (red line), which has a peak 3 hours before \npredicted high water. \n \nA surge model intercomparison exercise (de Vries et al, 1995), using common \nbathymetry and wind forcing, showed only small differences between models but \nhighlighted the need for accurate wind-stress since there was a tendency for all models to \nunderestimate the surge. Work on the UK tide-surge model by Williams and Flather \n(2000) has also shown a need for enhanced wind-stress relative to Smith and Banke \n(1975) and recently Brown and Wolf (in preparation) have shown this may be related to \nwave effects and also nearshore bathymetric resolution. \n \n 7\nObservations of tides and surges are generally made at coastal tide gauges, although these \nlocations are not always ideal for model validation since they may experience local \neffects by being in ports or estuaries rather than reflecting open sea conditions. The \nimportance of good wind forcing and detailed coastal bathymetry for producing good \nsurge forecasts has often been identified. Coastal winds may be modified by local effects \nsuch as orography, land-sea breezes and the coastal boundary layer. Better resolution is \nnow available in mesoscale wind forecasts and the use of unstructured grids allows better \nresolution of the coastline and near-shore bathymetry (Jones and Davies, 2005; 2008).  \nExtreme water levels at UK Class A tide gauges were investigated by Dixon and Tawn \n(1995) using various joint probability methods, viz. Joint Probability Method (JPM), \nRevised Joint Probability Method (RJPM) and Spatial Revised Joint Probability Method \n(SRJPM). These take some account of tide-surge interaction in a local sense. \n \n4. Wave modelling \n \nThe state of the art of wave modelling was presented by Komen et al. (1994) at the end of \nthe development period of the WAM (Wave Model) 3rd generation (3G) spectral wave \nmodel, which incorporated the nonlinear interaction terms for the first time explicitly. \nModels based on WAM physics have become standard for global to regional wave model \napplications. Since then further development of shallow water physics has been carried \nout and reviewed recently (The WISE group, 2007). Initially wave observations were \nquite limited, with a only few wave buoys and often only short-term deployments being \navailable, but now satellite altimeters can routinely provide wave height as well as water \nlevel. These wave height data are routinely assimilated in global wave models, running at \nnational centres. Further networks of wave buoys have been installed e.g. Wavenet in UK \n(http:\/\/www.cefas.co.uk\/data\/wavenet.aspx) and the situation is therefore improving. The \nUnited States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Data \nBuoy Center (NDBC) network gives the global coverage of wave data \n(http:\/\/www.ndbc.noaa.gov\/).There is also a more comprehensive list (although not \ncomplete) of wave observation networks on the JCOMM services web site \nhttp:\/\/www.jcomm-services.org\/Wave-and-storm-surge-data.html.\n \n5. Combined wave and storm surge modelling \n \nThe principles of wave and surge generation by wind are universal, although the impacts \nvary in different geographical locations. For both it is necessary to have a good wind \nforecast model of as high resolution as possible and this can be used to run separate wave \nand surge forecasts which, although not coupled, can be combined to give estimates of \ncoastal flooding. A combined surge and wave prediction model is described by Bargagli \net al. (2002) who show that prediction of surges in the Adriatic is improved by modelling \nthe whole Mediterranean due to better representation of the principal modes and the \npressure effect. They use a combined system comprising a limited area (LAM) \natmospheric circulation model, a wave model and a shallow water model. The regional \natmospheric circulation model provides a high-resolution forcing for the wave model \n(surface wind) and for the shallow water model (pressure field and surface wind). In the \nIrish Sea using the UK Met Office mesoscale winds is definitely an improvement for the \n 8\nwave model (Osuna et al, 2007). Of course the LAM model predictive quality is to a \ncertain extent controlled by the quality of its boundary conditions, which are determined \nby how good the coarser global atmospheric model is. \n \nWolf and Flather (2005) carried out a hindcast of the 1953 storm event using wave and \nsurge models driven by the same wind forcing although the models were not coupled. \nThis allowed a better understanding of the event to be obtained, showing that wave \nheights reached 10m in the southern North Sea at the height of the storm. The maximum \nsurge coincided closely in time with tidal high water, producing very high water levels \nalong the coasts of the southern North Sea. Maximum surges exceeded 2.25 m over most \nof the Southern Bight of the North Sea, with values of 3 m and more on parts of the \nDutch coast. Both surge and wave components were estimated to be approximately 1 in \n50 year events. The maximum water level also occurred when the offshore waves were \nclose to their maximum. Deriving an estimate of return period for the total water level is \nmore problematic and is dependent on location. \n \nThe question remains as to how far we can go with uncoupled models although it has \nproved difficult to demonstrate an improvement in forecast accuracy using coupled \nmodels. In the following sections we review the physical interaction processes and the \nstate of the art of coupled wave-tide-surge models. \n \n6. Wave-tide-surge interaction \n \nThere are several mechanisms by which waves and the currents and water level \nassociated with tide and surge interact, each component of the combined motion affecting \nthe others (Wolf et al., 1988). These may be summarized as (a) the effects of water levels \nand currents on waves and (b) the effect of waves on tides and surges (Peregrine and \nJonsson, 1983). \n \nFirst we consider the effect of water levels on nearshore wave transformation. As waves \nenter shallow water, when the depth is less than half the wavelength, the processes of \nshoaling and refraction change the wavelength and phase speed but the wave period \nremains constant (in the absence of currents). As energy propagates at the group velocity, \nby energy conservation the wave height first decreases then increases (this is because of \nthe group velocity property that it increases first with intermediate depth, only to decrease \nwhen the depth becomes shallower see e.g. Wiegel, 1964). Finally the energy dissipation \nprocesses of breaking and bottom friction start to limit the wave height. If the water depth \nis modified, by mean sea level changes or tide and\/or surge, this will have corresponding \neffects on wave height. At the coast an increase in water depth will increase the wave \nheight and also the distance to which waves can penetrate inland. Tide and surge currents \ncan affect wave generation, propagation and dissipation. The effect on surface stress is to \nchange the apparent wind and effective fetch. There may also be an enhancement of the \nwave friction in the bottom stress (e.g. Grant and Madsen, 1979) although Soulsby and \nClarke (2005) state this is negligible. Current gradients in the horizontal also cause wave \nrefraction and currents produce a Doppler shift of frequency. In the presence of currents \nit is the wave action which is conserved rather than wave energy.  All these processes are \n 9\ndescribed in more detail in Wolf et al. (1988), Osuna and Wolf (2005) and Ozer et al \n(2000). \n \nWaves can affect the mean flow and water level in the nearshore zone through radiation \nstress causing longshore drift and wave setup (Longuet-Higgins and Stewart, 1962). In \nthe surface layer there is a net transport due to waves (Stokes\u2019 drift). Waves may affect \nthe generation of surges by affecting surface roughness. As stated earlier, air-sea \ninteraction, by which momentum is transferred from the wind to the waves and the mean \nflow is a complex process. Janssen (1989; 1991) introduced the concept of wave stress in \nwhich wave age affects the surface roughness and implemented it in the WAM model.  \nFurther investigation of this has been carried out recently by Brown and Wolf \n(submitted). Waves may enhance the bottom friction experienced by currents in shallow \nwater as discussed e.g. in Grant and Madsen (1979). \n \n7. Coupled model development \n \nHeaps (1983) identified the need for a wave model to improve the specification of wind \nstress in surge models. Various interaction mechanisms including the modification of \nsurface drag by waves were identified as potentially important by Wolf et al. (1988). \nHubbert and Wolf (1991) implemented current refraction in the WAM model and \ninvestigated the modulation of waves over an idealized Gulf Stream ring. Some results \nfrom early attempts at coupling are given in Wu and Flather (1992), Wu et al. (1994). \nTolman (1990) concluded from his investigation into the effects of tides and storm surges \non wind waves that \u2018both the instationarity and the inhomogeneity of depth and current \nplay a significant role in wave\u2013tide interaction\u2019 and recommended further investigations \ninto the effects of wave\u2013tide interactions on wave heights. Mastenbroek et al (1993) show \nthe influence of a wave-dependent surface drag coefficient on surge elevations. Even if \nthese surge elevations can be reproduced with an appropriate \u2018tuning\u2019 of this parameter in \nconventional wind stress formulations e.g. the dimensionless constant in the Charnock \nrelation (Charnock, 1955), they argue that \u2018a wave-dependent drag is to be preferred for \nstorm surge modelling\u2019. The dissipation of tide and surge energy may be affected by \nwaves modifying the bottom friction coefficient for currents. Wolf and Prandle (1999) \nnoted a change in tidal current amplitude related to wave height. Rosales et al. (2008) \nmade a detailed study of the effect of wave-current interaction in the bottom friction. \nDavies and Lawrence (1994) noticed a significant change of the tidal amplitude and \nphase in shallow near-coastal regions due to enhanced frictional effects associated with \nwind-driven flow and wind wave turbulence. \n \nA summary of the contributions to coupling, up to the end of the WAM project, is given \nby Burgers et al. (1994) and Cavaleri et al. (1994). This has led to the development of \ncoupled models for waves, tides and surges and for waves, ocean and atmosphere, e.g. in \nECAWOM (MAST II Project MAS2-CT940091) based on more complete physics. \nAlthough some interaction processes have been shown to produce a significant effect, a \nclear demonstration that coupled models give consistently better results than tuned \nseparate models is required to persuade operational agencies to adopt them (Ozer et al., \n2000). In the EU PROMISE project, Monbaliu et al (1999, 2000) developed a version of \n 10\nWAM (here termed ProWAM) more suited to shallow water and high resolution. Ozer et \nal. (2000) presented a coupling module. In recent years the improvement in computer \ncapability has allowed high-resolution 3-dimensional models of tides and surges to be \ndeveloped (Jones and Davies, 1998) and increasingly coupled with wind-wave models \n(Davies and Lawrence, 1994; Osuna and Wolf, 2005). Wolf (2005), Osuna and Monbaliu \n(2004) and Osuna and Wolf (2005) have presented applications of 2-way coupled models \n(i.e. including effects of wave on currents and vice versa). Zhang and Li (1996) \nimplemented a coupled model for the South China Sea. Choi et al. (2003) implemented a \ncoupled wave\u2013tide\u2013surge model to investigate the effect of tides, storm surges in the \nYellow Sea. \n \nIn our implementation, ProWAM works as a module of POLCOMS, the Proudman \nOceanographic Laboratory 3D baroclinic circulation model (Holt and James, 2001), so \nthe wave model uses the same bathymetry and wind information as supplied to the \nhydrodynamic model. The model has been implemented on a parallel computer. The \nwave-current interaction module allows the synchronous exchange of information \nbetween POLCOMS which computes the 3-D baroclinic current field) and WAM. Figs. 5 \nand 6 show some results of 2-way coupling for the Irish Sea on a 1 nautical mile grid. In \norder to incorporate swell coming from the Atlantic, a coarser resolution wave model, \nwhich includes part of the northeast Atlantic Ocean (NEA), was used. The open boundary \nconditions for the hydrodynamic model were generated by an implementation of \nPOLCOMS for the northwest European continental shelf on 12km resolution. Results \nindicate that the effect of currents on the waves (e.g. modulations of wave height and \nmean period) can be significant in the Irish Sea area (see Figure 5). Larger effects are \nobserved around headlands and shoals, where the magnitude and shear of currents are \nlarge. The effect of waves on currents is also evident around headlands and shoals \n(Figure 6). During stormy periods, differences in the daily mean current speed are mainly \ncaused by the wave-dependent surface stress. The effect of the combined wave-current \nbottom shear stress is confined to coastal areas. \n \nMellor (2003; 2005) and Ardhuin et al. (2008) have used a derivation of the generalized \nLangrangian mean equations of motion to provide consistent equations for general wave\u2013\nturbulence\u2013mean flow interactions in three dimensions, facilitating the computation of \nthe Stokes\u2019 drift, radiation stress and other wave-current interaction processes in \nnumerical models. Bolanos et al (2007) made some calculations using the POLCOMS-\nWAM coupled model using Mellor\u2019s formulation to include effects of vertical variation \nof currents. \n \n8. Operational forecast systems \n \nSeparate tide-surge and wave models have long been in operation at many centres with \nglobal and regional wave models and national surge and tide models for limited areas. \nUsually 2D models are sufficient for tide and surge forecasting although 3D models may \nbe used to give other variables as well.  \n \n 11\nThe EU PROMISE (Pre-Operational Modelling In Seas of Europe) project advanced the \ncapability of pre-operational modelling (Prandle, 2000). Flather (2000) reviewed the \nexisting operational forecast systems for NW Europe, which were already quite mature. \nThere have been some updates since then and operational modelling is rapidly growing \nelsewhere in the world, usually associated with meteorological forecasting. \n \nThe UK Met Office has run the 2D coupled tide-surge model, developed at Proudman \nOceanographic Laboratory (POL), operationally since 1978. The present model, CS3, \nwas introduced in 1991 with resolution 1\/6\u00ba by 1\/9\u00ba, forced by Met Office NWP \nmesoscale winds on a similar resolution (~12km). It has open boundary input of 15 tidal \nharmonics and an external surge component, assumed hydrostatic. Tide-generating forces \nand the drying and flooding of intertidal areas are accounted for. The 2nd generation (2G) \nwave model is based on Golding (1983) and updated by Holt (1994). There is a global \nversion of the wave model within which is nested a European wave model, then a UK \nwaters model. The latter includes time-varying currents from the tide-surge model, with \ninteractions due to bottom friction and refraction in depths less than 200 m i.e. one-way \ncoupling. The performance of the 2G model compared favourably with 3G until recently \nbut this is no longer the case when compared with buoy data (Bidlot et al., 2007). A \nroutine inter-comparison of operational wave forecasting is carried out by JCOMM with \nmonthly reports available on the JCOMM web site (https:\/\/www.jcomm-\nservices.org\/documents.htm?parent=190). The surge-tide model is used to predict the \nstorm surge component, accounting for interaction with the tides, by subtracting the \nmodel predicted tide from the tide with surge solution. This is then added to the \nharmonically predicted tide based on tide gauge observations to estimate total water \nlevel. Results are used by the UK Storm Tide Forecasting Service and the Environment \nAgency (EA) as the basis for flood warnings on the coasts of England and Wales. The \nUK National Tide Gauge Network consists of gauges at about 35 sites, from which data \nare retrieved in near real-time to check forecast accuracy and for assimilation. The model \nforecast accuracy achieved varies for different parts of the coast is typically 10 cm RMS. \n \nA new combined wave and water level flood warning system has recently been launched \nas part of the UK National Flood Forecasting System, initially for the NE of England \nfrom Berwick-on-Tweed to the Humber Estuary (Lane et al., 2008). It uses \ntransformation of offshore wave forecasts with a wave overtopping model (Hedges and \nReis, 1998) combined with the tide and surge forecasts already available and produces \nflood warnings which consider land use and flood risk. It went online just in time to warn \nof floods at Whitley Bay, Scarborough and Roker, Sunderland caused by a large surge in \nNovember 2007 (3m in Thames region). \n \nOther methods of combined surge and wave forecasting include joint probability methods \nfor waves and water levels which takes account of wave-tide-surge interactions (Hawkes \net al., 2000). \n \nAt the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) the wave \nmodel (ECWAM) is coupled with the IFS atmospheric model. The effect of wave stress \nhas been shown to improve the coupled model system. Recent statistics are shown by \n 12\nJanssen (2008). The ECMWF system also produces ensemble forecasts, including waves \n(as also do NCEP and the US Navy). Uncertainties and extreme conditions can be better \nquantified when ensemble forecasts are used. A recent example is given in de Vries \n(2008) for storm surges. An ensemble system for the UK storm surge model is being \ndeveloped (Kevin Horsburgh, personal communication). \n \nNOAA Tides and Currents, managed by the Center for Operational Oceanographic \nProducts and Services (CO-OPS), gives a link to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration's oceanographic and meteorological forecasts (http:\/\/www.co-\nops.nos.noaa.gov\/). The SLOSH model, developed by Jelesnianski et al. (1992), is still \nthe US operational surge forecast model for surges driven by tropical cyclones (Zhang et \nal., 2008) although many other models are also now available e.g. the Princeton Ocean \nmodel (POM) and its derivatives and ADCIRC. \n \nThe operational forecast system for Venice is still based on statistical models since their \nskill is not yet matched by hydrodynamic models. Problems may arise due to errors in the \nforecast wind field and seiches (Lionello et al, 1998; Wakelin and Proctor, .2002). \n \n9. Climate change effects \n \nA vast amount of effort within many projects has recently been expended to examine the \npotential future flooding under climate change scenarios. Only a few studies are \nmentioned here as an illustration. Reanalysis projects over several decades such as \nERA40 and NCEP\/NCAR have produced consistent analysis of winds and waves e.g. \nCaires et al. (2006) which enable trends to be more confidently extracted (Trenberth, \n2008). Such wind data can then be used to run surge models over these time scales to \nexamine potential trends in coastal flooding. Such an exercise was carried out in the \nCDV2075 project (Sutherland and Wolf, 2001) in which climate model winds produced \nfor present day and twice-CO2 scenarios were used to drive a suite of models from \noffshore waves, through nearshore wave transformation using SWAN to overtopping, \ncombined with water levels, for 5 different locations around the UK. Tsimplis et al. \n(2005) examined local variations in climate impacts on waves and sea level. The Tyndall \nCoastal Simulator project (Leake et al., 2008) is using Hadley Centre climate model \nwinds with different future climate scenarios to predict changes in wave climate round \nthe UK.  \n \nButler et al. (2007) examine trends in surges from the tide-surge model which shows \nstrong positive trends in the frequency and severity of storm surge events at locations in \nthe north-eastern North Sea, whilst trends at locations in the southern and western North \nSea appear to be dominated by decadal variability. Woodworth et al. (2007) conclude that \nspatial patterns of correlation of extreme high and low waters (extreme still water sea \nlevels) with the NAO index are similar to those of median or mean sea level studied \npreviously. Pirazolli et al. (2006) examined evidence for recent trends in coastal flooding \nfrom several years of data at tide gauges in the English Channel, which showed there was \na lot of variability with medium-term coastal flooding risk seems to increase especially at \n 13\nWeymouth, Bournemouth and Portsmouth, and to some extent at Le Havre and \nSheerness. \n \nIt is generally accepted that in a warming climate the number and intensity of tropical \ncyclones will increase as their generation is closely linked to sea surface temperature. On \nthe other hand mid-latitude depressions may not necessarily increase as there are 2 \nopposing mechanisms: the Equator-to-pole temperature difference decreases with global \nwarming but there is some evidence that the number of winter storms increases at the \ndownwind end of northern hemisphere storm tracks (Wolf and Woolf, 2006). A \nsignificant increase in cyclonic activity over the North Atlantic has been observed during \nthe second half of the 20th century and storminess increased in the NE Atlantic and NW \nEurope (Alexandersson et al., 1998; 2000). Trends toward higher storm surge levels have \nrecently been reported for various locations of northern Europe (Lowe et al., 2001; Lowe \nand Gregory, 2005; Meier et al., 2004; Woth et al., 2005), However in a recent paper \nMatulla et al. (2008) show that the trend of increase in storminess and increased wave \nheight in the North Atlantic from the 1960\u2019s to the 1990s has ended with a return to more \ncalm conditions. There appears to be a quasi-decadal cycle which coincided with the \nstrongly positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) over that period but the ability of the \nNAO to act as a predictor for storminess appears to vary in space and time. Thus SLR \nmay be predicted with some confidence, although the rate of change is still uncertain, but \nthe future surge and wave climate is more difficult to predict. Nicholls and Lowe (2004) \ndiscuss the possibilities for adaptation and mitigation of SLR. \n \n10. Summary and future directions \n \nWaves and surges are both driven by the same atmospheric forcing and already separate \nwave and tide-surge models are run in parallel. It has been demonstrated that the effects \nof coupling can be of the order of 10% in significant wave height and 20% in wave \nperiod with 10% change in currents. Although it has proved difficult to demonstrate \nimproved accuracy in coastal predictions from coupled models this may be due in part to \nthe limitations of data and model resolution. \n \nHigher resolution modelling is now possible using unstructured grids. There is still a need \nfor good nearshore bathymetry although this is more readily available with coastal \nLIDAR surveys filling in the inter-tidal areas. This will allow the full inclusion of effects \nof wave setup and longshore drift due to radiation stress which is mainly confined to the \nvery nearshore zone. The effects of non-uniform unsteady 3D currents and especially \nvertical shear need further investigation. The effect of currents on high frequency waves \nmay cause wave blocking producing wave reflection or breaking (e.g. Chawla and Kirby, \n2002) which may be significant in tidal inlets and areas like the Bristol Channel with tidal \ncurrents exceeding 2ms-1. Further work is needed on surface wind-stress, to elucidate the \ndetails of the air-sea momentum flux, especially in the coastal boundary layer. Detailed \ninundation modelling is becoming possible with increased computer power and terrain \nmodels. Better observations are becoming available, especially using remote sensing, of \nwind, waves, water levels, currents and bathymetry e.g. using HF and X-band radar, \nLIDAR, nearshore sea-bed pressure sensors for tides, surges and waves, ADCP for \n 14\ncombined waves, currents and water levels. Some interesting ideas on the importance of \nLangmuir circulation and the effects of waves on mixing need to be pursued e.g. the \nwave-induced turbulence of Qiao et al (2004). Further impact studies in the nearshore \nzone e.g. the implications of wave groups and the effects on sediment transport and \ncoastal morphology are likely. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis work was supported by the UK Natural Environment Research Council. \n \nReferences \n \nAbe, K. 1979 Size of great earthquakes of 1837\u20131974 inferred from tsunami data.
