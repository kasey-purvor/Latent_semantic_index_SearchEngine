MIMO has been \nproven as an effective method to achieve this. Previously, the focus of MIMO-OFDM research in High \nPerformance Metropolitan Area Network (HIPERMAN) systems was on Space Time Coding (STC) and \nbeamforming. Recently, Multi-User Detection (MUD) has emerged as a novel approach in MIMO-OFDM-based \nHIPERMAN systems. In this paper, we have proposed a new MAC design, which includes the new and flexible \nMAC frame structure and an efficient dynamic resource allocation algorithm, in order to accommodate the MUD \ntechniques in uplink transmission in HIPERMAN systems. The performance of the new MAC design has been \nevaluated via simulation means. The simulation results show that the new MAC design based on MUD can \nsignificantly increase the system capacity. \n\u2019 \nIntroduction \nA H3PERMAN system, which uses IEEE 802.16 as a prototype, is a Broadband Fixed Wireless Access (BFWA) \nsystem [l]. It has advantages of rapid deployment, large range capabilities and low maintenance cost. However, \nlike all the other wireless systems, HIPERMAN has limited capacity per base station. Therefore, how to improve \nthe system capacity is a key research issue in HIPERMAN systems [2]. \nSince the MIMO techniques allow more users to be served at the same time in the same frequency, they are \nemerging as a novel approach for spectrally efficient terrestrial HIPERMAN systems. In the recent years, the \nfocus of MIMO-OFDM research in HIPERMAN was on STC and beamforming [3], and some of them have \nbeen standardised [4]. \nSince MUD allows the parallel operation of multiple radio links and has very good performance in NLOS \nenvironment, using MUD in OFDM-based HIPERMAN system to improve the system capacity is emerging as a \nnew research area. In this paper, we have investigated the effect of MUD on the HIPERMAN MAC design, and \nproposed a new HIPERMAN MAC design to accommodate MUD techniques in uplink transmission. Based on a \nflexible MAC frame structure, a dynamic resource allocation algorithm is proposed to intelligently construct the \nMAC frame and therefore maximise the system capacity. \nIn this paper, we firstly describe the proposed HIPERMAN MAC frame structure. Then, a novel dynamic \nresource allocation algorithm is proposed to accommodate the MUD techniques. Following this, we evaluate the \nperformance of the proposed MAC design via simulation. Finally, conclusions are drawn. \nNew MAC Design \nBy introducing MUD techniques into the HIPERMAN systems, it will have significant impacts on MAC design, \nespecially on MAC frame structure, scheduling and resource allocation algorithm and the interface between the \nMAC and physical layers. \n. -  \nUser 8, b, c User i, j User x, y. z \nFigure 1 MAC Frame Structure Using MIMO techniques \n223 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on April 20,2010 at 08:15:25 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nFigure 1 shows the proposed MAC frame structure. Like the current design, the MAC frame is divided into \nuplink and downlink sub-frames. Frame Control Header ( E H )  is used to specify the whole MAC frame. It \ncontains information on how to access the uplink and downlink, and modulation and coding schemes of the \nallocated data. In this paper, the proposed changes on FCH are specified and new Information Elements (IEs) are \nintroduced. The proposed MAC frame not only can accommodate the MUD techniques, but also is compatible \nwith the current design. One of the major advantages of our proposal is that it does not result in major \nmodifications to current standards. \nBy adopting MUD techniques in HIPERMAN, each user will have a unique spatial channel signature, this \nsignature is a complex vector, and depends on the propagation environment and multi-path fading channel \nrealization. The performance of exploited MUD technique will strongly depend on the amount of correlation \nbetween users\u2019 spatial signature. In general, higher User Signature Correlation (USC) values are detrimental, \nespecially when there are a high number of simultaneous users being served. The system capacity depends on the \nusers\u2019 transmit power, users\u2019 signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), the number of receiver antennas at \nbase station and the correlations between the users. The SINR of each user can be appropriately used on \nselection of appropriate combination of users for joint transmission. The SINR on a single user can be expressed \nas follows: \nD I. \nSINR(i) = - \nIi + N  \nD \nSINR(i) is the SINR of the User i, Pi and Pj are the received powers of Users i and j, respectively. pij is the cross \ncorrelation between Users i and j spatial signatures, Ii is the interference from other users on user i, N is the \nadditive noise in front end of to the User I receiver, and finally N, is the number of sub-carriers. As shown in the \nabove formula, SINR(i) depends on pij, It means that the users\u2019 SINR are highly related to their spatial \nseparation. The higher the users\u2019 spatial correlation, the lower their SINR will be. \nNO \nI \nYU \n: :  . .  . .  . .  . .  \n. .  . .  . .  . .  . .  , .  . .  . .  \ni :  . .  \n: :  . .  . .  . .  . .  \n\u2019 :  i :  . .  . .  . ,  . .  . .  . .  . ,  . .  . .  . .  \n. .  . .  \n. .  . .  \n: :  \n: :  . .  \n: :  . .  . .  . .  . .

Restrictions apply. \nSince the users\u2019 spatial characteristics are time varying, an efficient dynamic resource allocation algorithm is \nrequired to accommodate MUD and thus increase the system capacity. The scheduler in base station, which \nimplement the dynamic resource allocation algorithm, will monitor the SINR between all possible pairs of users \nand decide which users are to be served simultaneously based on their SINR and the cross correlation of channel \nsignatures between the users. \nThe dynamic resource allocation algorithm is specified as shown in Figure 2. It main principle is as follows: \nBased on the channel signature matrix, each user\u2019s SINR can be obtained. When a new bandwidth request is \nunder processing, the scheduler will find a time burst and checks whether the new user\u2019s channel signature is \nconsistent in terms of the adopted scheduling measure (i.e. SINR of all users of the corresponding channel \nsignature matrix) with the channel signatures of already allocated users in this time burst. This means that the \nscheduler will re-calculate the adopted measure related to the new set of already allocated user and new \ntentatively added user, and then compare with a pre-set threshold. If the re-calculated measure is acceptable (i.e. \nall users\u2019 SINR to be above the corresponding threshold), the new user\u2019s requested bandwidth will be allocated \nand the burst profile will be updated. Otherwise, the scheduler will check whether the new user\u2019s bandwidth \nrequest can be allocated in another burst or not. \nThe proposed dynamic resource allocation algorithm has the following advantages: \nWhen it receives a bandwidth request, it goes through all the relevant bursts to see with which group of \nusers the new user can be simultaneously transmitted and do not degrade their performance. This will \nmaximise the opportunity to allocate users and significantly increase the system\u2019s capacity. \nSince the flexible modulation scheme is used, it improves the chance of new bandwidth requests to be \nallocated. \nNumber of OFDM sub-carriers \nNumber of Data Sub-carrier \nCoding and Modulation technique \nPower of users \nChannel \nCorrelation \nSimulation Evaluations \nBandwidth 7 M H Z  \n33 P \n256 \n200 \nUncoded QPSK \nEqual power \n2x2 MIMO 6-tap SUI-5 Rayleigh Fading \nWithout Correlation: Case 0 \nWith Correlation: Case 1,2, 3, and 4 \nI Modulationschemes 1 QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM I \nTable 1 - Main Parameters used in System Level Simulation \nThe proposed MAC layer, including the new MAC frame structure and dynamic resource allocation algorithms, \nhas been simulated and evaluated via simulation. A system level simulator and a link level simulator, which is \nused to perform physical layer simulation, are used during the simulation, and the results from the link level \nsimulator are used as the input to the system level simulator. The parameters used in the system and link level \nsimulation are listed in Table 1 and 2. \nTo study the impacts of using MUD techniques in HIPERMAN, we have specifically constructed a cell, whose \ngeography are made of several typical scenarios and a group of users has been located in the cell. In these \nscenarios, we use different users\u2019 positions, different distances between the users, different scatters\u2019 separation \nangles and different scatters\u2019 positions. Based on the results obtained from the typical scenarios, we can get a \nclear picture about the impact of cell geography anti users\u2019 positions in the cell on the users\u2019 spatial correlation \nand users\u2019 SINR values. For example, the results show that, for the uplink multi-user joint detection, Rx correlation \nis a dominant factor in the user\u2019s spatial correlation. Tx correlation is also important but is not a dominant factor. \nWhen multi-user joint detection techniques are applied in the uplink, the user\u2019s spatial correlation is highly related to \nthe cell\u2019s geography and users\u2019 positions in the cell. \n225 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The \u201cdash-triangle\u2019\u2019 line \nrepresents the system capacity where our proposed new MAC design with dynamic resource allocation is used to \nexploit MUD. When 90 OFDM symbols are allocated to the uplink and QPSK is used, overall 38 users can be \naccommodated. The \u201cdash-star\u2019\u2019 lines represent the system capacity where First-Come-First-Served algorithm is \nused without multi user transmission. For the same condition, when 90 OFDM symbols are allocated to the \nuplink and QPSK is used, overall 22 users can be accommodated. This shows that the proposed MAC design \nwith multi user dynamic resource allocation achieves 73% increase in system capacity. \nSince HIPERMAN is a TDD system, the resources allocated between uplink and downlink subframes are not \nfixed. Figure 4 shows the comparison of system capacity between different MAC designs when 60 OFDM \nsymbols allocated to the uplink subframe. Similar to Figure 3, the \u201cdash-triangle\u201d line represents the system \ncapacity with multi user dynamic resource allocation. When 60 OFDM symbols are allocated to the uplink and \nQPSK is used, overall 24 users can be accommodated. The \u201cdash-star\u201d line represents the system capacity where \nFirst-Come-First-Served algorithm is used without MUD. Under the same conditions overall 14 users can be \naccommodated. This translates to 72% increase in system capacity thanks to the proposed MAC design. This \nconfirms the trend in system capacity increase as observed in the 90 OFDM symbol case. \nConclusions \nIn this paper, we have proposed a new MAC design, which includes the MAC structure and a dynamic resource \nallocation algorithm to accommodate the MUD techniques, which is a novel approach in HIPERMAN systems \nresearch. The simulation results prove that the new MAC design can effectively take advantage of MUD \ntechniques and therefore significantly increase the system capacity. In the future, we will further develop our \ndesign and compare our design with more other proposals. \nReferences \n[l] C. Eklund, R. Marks, K.L. Stanwood and S.
