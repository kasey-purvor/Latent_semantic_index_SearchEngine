We would like however to offer some \nadvice for those attempting to follow in their footsteps with no background in cross-\ncultural psychology or psychometrics.  \n  \nIt is important when constructing a developmental test battery to have clear theoretical \nideas of the domains of interest. When assessing the impact of disease on cognitive \ndevelopment, examining global intellectual ability is unlikely to show group differences \n[2]. Conversely, when examining children\u2019s overall developmental levels, items need to \nrepresent a variety of abilities that are known to be related to, for example, global \ncognitive ability.  \n  \nMoving to item selection, clear reporting and rigorous implementation of selection \ncriteria will assist those wishing to reproduce methodology or evaluate quality. No \nassumptions should be made about acceptability, even on the advice of local parents. We \nadvocate a multi-method approach to item selection. This should include consultation \nwith psychologists and fieldworkers, individual parent interviews and child assessments, \nfollowed by examining ceiling and floor effects. Children and parents can surprise \nresearchers by their openness to sensitive or difficult items. \n  \nReplicability will be enhanced if administration procedures are also adequately described.  \nObservation, parent report, or direct testing of the same skill can produce widely varying \nresults. Confidence in assessments will likewise be increased if the usual statistical \nexaminations of reliability and validity are made; table 1 describes some of these. \nFinally, returning to theoretical considerations, children\u2019s developmental abilities do not \nrepresent a unitary domain. Some abilities would be expected to be more closely related \nthan others. Careful factor analyses can reveal whether, for example, parent reporting \nsuffers from the \u201chalo effect\u201d, observation or testing is influenced by overall behavioural \ncooperation, or whether genuine development in theoretically coherent domains is being \nassessed. \n  \nAmina Abubakar, PhD \nCentre for Geographic Medicine Research \u2013 Coast, Kenya Medical Research Institute \n(KEMRI), Kenya\/ Tilburg University, Netherlands  \n  \nKatie Alcock, DPhil, CPsychol \nDepartment of Psychology, Lancaster University, UK \n  \nPenny Holding, PhD \nCentre for Geographic Medicine Research \u2013 Coast, Kenya Medical Research Institute \n(KEMRI), Kenya\/ Case Western Reserve University, USA\/ African Mental Health \nFoundation, Kenya \n  \n1.
