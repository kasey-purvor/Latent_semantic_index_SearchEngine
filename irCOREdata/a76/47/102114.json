The principal challenges for effi-\ncient room-temperature operation are to reduce nonradiative\nShockley\u2013Read and Auger recombination processes, which\nspoil the internal efficiency, and then to improve optical out-\ncoupling of the generated light.\nThe application of hydrostatic pressure has been exten-\nsively used as an investigative tool to study the internal ef-\nficiency and recombination mechanisms that occur in opto-\nelectronic devices.2 The major advantage of high-pressure\ninvestigations is that they enable nondestructive and revers-\nible variation of the semiconductor band gap, which yields\ninformation about radiative and nonradiative recombination\nrates. We note that although hydrostatic pressure has been\nextensively used to study semiconductor LEDs and laser\nstructures, the performance of mid-infrared LEDs subjected\nto high pressure has not previously been investigated. In this\nletter, we report on the influence of applied hydrostatic pres-\nsure ~up to 10 kbar! on 3.3 mm mid-infrared InAs LEDs\noperating at room temperature, using He gas as the pressure\nmedium.\nThe 3.3 mm LEDs for this investigation were grown on\nInAs substrates by liquid-phase epitaxy ~LPE!, using a con-\nventional horizontal sliding boat in ultrapure hydrogen. The\ndevices were of a double-heterostructure design in which the\nunintentionally doped n-InAs active layer was enclosed be-\ntween p- and n-InAsSbP confinement layers. The P content\nin the confinement layer was 0.40 (Eg5570 meV) to pro-\nvide a higher band-gap energy and large interface band off-\nsets for good carrier confinement. The InAs active region\nwas 0.7 mm thick (Eg5354 meV, under ambient condi-\ntions!.

Redistribution subject tetched LEDs using standard photolithographic techniques.\nFabrication details and device characteristics when operating\nunder ambient conditions have been published previously\nelsewhere.3\nThe InAs\/InAsSbP double heterostructure exhibits\ntype-II behavior and although it does not contain any quan-\ntum wells, band bending at the heterostructure interface leads\nto some confinement of the carriers in electron\u2013hole quasi-\nquantum wells located on either side of the interface. This\naffords the possibility of reduced Auger recombination under\nambient conditions since the electron\u2013hole wavefunction\noverlap is reduced. The application of hydrostatic pressure\ncan give information on the relative significance of the dif-\nferent recombination mechanisms that are sensitive to\nchanges in the band gap, as shown below. Under ambient\nconditions (T5298 K, P51 atm), the LEDs exhibited elec-\ntroluminescence with a peak wavelength of 3.3 mm3. Light\u2013\ncurrent characteristics were measured for several LEDs as a\nfunction of hydrostatic pressure using 10 ms current pulses of\nup to 140 mA at a frequency of 5 kHz ~corresponding to a\nduty cycle of 5%!. After passing through the pressure cell\nwindow, the radiation was collected using a cooled ~77 K!\nInSb detector and a lock-in amplifier. Note that the emission\nwas viewed through the n-type ~top! side of the LED, which\nwas 300 mm in diameter and had a ring-like contact. This\nallows us to neglect intervalence band absorption in the fol-\nlowing interpretation, as this process only occurs in p-type\nlayers. Figure 1 shows a plot of the integrated spontaneous\nelectroluminescence (Lspon), corrected for detector response,\nagainst current in the pressure range 0 to 9.4 kbar for one of\nthe 3.3-mm LED samples. We observed a significant increase\nin radiative efficiency as a function of hydrostatic pressure.\nFigure 2 shows that for two different devices, the light output\nat constant current ~140 mA! increased by a factor of 3.74\nover the range from 0 to 9.4 kbar. We can give a qualitative\ninterpretation of this in terms of the relative contribution of\nthe radiative and Auger recombination mechanisms in our\nLEDs.

Lett., Vol. 82, No. 8, 24 February 2003 Choulis et al.I5I leak1edeff~An1Bn21Cn3!, ~1!\nwhere I leak is the leakage current, e is the electron charge, deff\nis the effective width of the active region where the radiative\nrecombination occurs, n is the carrier density, and A, B, and\nC are the usual recombination coefficients for Shockley\u2013\nRead\u2013Hall ~SRH!, radiative, and Auger recombination, re-\nspectively. Due to device geometry ~ring contact with rela-\ntively large contact area!, we assume that the I leak term is\nmainly due to electron and\/or hole leakage over the hetero-\njunction barriers. However due to the large InAsSbP\/InAs\nband offsets and due to the fact that no light emission was\nobserved corresponding to the bulk band gaps of InAs and\nInAsSbP3 we believe that I leak is insignificant under ambient\nconditions. Furthermore, since the bands are expected to be-\nhave similarly in these materials under applied pressure, the\nleakage may be considered as constant. For example, we\nestimate that the corrections to the electron and hole band\noffsets induced by a pressure of 9.4 kbar are only 4 and 1\nmeV, respectively. We therefore assume that I leak is indepen-\ndent of pressure. Furthermore, the devices studied here were\nproduced using a rare-earth gettering technique,4 which re-\nFIG. 1.

Redistribution subject tduces the residual doping in the active region to ,531015\nand hence we may regard the associated SRH recombination\n@An term in Eq. ~1!# as insignificant at room temperature\n~previous experiments also support this conclusion1,3!. In any\ncase, the capture cross section for recombination through de-\nfects or impurities is almost independent of pressure. There-\nfore, it is clear from the large change in electroluminescence\nwith applied pressure which we observed, that neither leak-\nage nor SRH recombination can be the dominant mechanism\nin these devices. We may assume that at constant current the\nsum of the radiative and Auger terms in Eq. ~1! is pressure\nindependent:\nedeff~Bn21Cn3!5const~P !. ~2!\nThe measured integrated spontaneous emission is propor-\ntional to L}Bn2 and increases by a factor of 3.74 when P is\nincreased from 0 to 9.4 kbar. From Eq. ~2! we estimate that\nthe contribution of radiative recombination I rad5edeffBn2 to\nthe current density at zero pressure is less than 27%, which\nmeans that Auger recombination is the dominant process in\nthese LEDs.\nType-II heterostructures have two important channels for\nAuger recombination; conduction\u2013heavy-hole-band to\nconduction\u2013conduction-band ~CHCC! and conduction\u2013\nheavy-hole to heavy-hole\u2013split-off-band ~CHHS!.5 Simple\nanalytical expressions can be used to understand how these\nprocesses vary with band gap. The band-to-band Auger pro-\ncess can be expressed as a thermally activated process given\nby6\nC5C0 expS 2DEakT D,ln C5ln C02 DEakT , ~3!\nwhere C0 is approximately independent of temperature and\npressure, but includes terms due to the Coulomb interaction\nbetween initial and final Auger states. The main pressure\ndependence of the Auger activation energy (DEa) for the\ndirect Auger recombination processes CHCC and CHHS is\ndue to the band-gap dependence of DEa and is given by6\nDEa~CHCC!5\nmeEg\n~me1mh!\n,\nDEa~CHHS!5\nmso~Eg2Dso!\n~2mh1me2mso!\n, ~4!\nwhere me (0.023mo), mh (0.41mo), and mso (0.16mo) are\nthe electron, hole, and spin\u2013orbit effective mass, respec-\ntively ~the values within the parentheses are the effective\nmasses of InAs under ambient conditions used in the calcu-\nlations!. Dso is the spin\u2013orbit split-off energy. The electron\nand spin\u2013orbit effective masses increase approximately pro-\nportionally with increasing pressure, while the hole effective\nmass is relatively independent of pressure.2 From Eqs. ~3!\nand ~4!, it can be seen that the Auger coefficient significantly\nreduces with increasing Eg and hence with increasing pres-\nsure (]Eg \/]P for InAs is 10 meV\/kbar7!.\nAlthough in the InAs active region, the band gap and the\nspin\u2013orbit band gap are nearly equal, experimentally we do\nnot observe any resonant behavior in the light output as a\nfunction of applied hydrostatic pressure, as suggested by Eq.o AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\n1151Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 82, No. 8, 24 February 2003 Choulis et al.~4! ~see Fig. 1!. Consequently, we believe that over the full\npressure range, the CHCC process is more dominant.\nWe performed a similar experiment on double-\nheterostructure type-I LEDs, which were also fabricated in\nour laboratory by LPE.3 These LEDs had an InAs0.95Sb0.05\nactive region and operated at 3.8 mm at room temperature.\nThe results are compared in Fig. 3 for a constant injection\ncurrent of 140 mA in both cases. There is clearly a much\nlarger increase in electroluminescence from the type-II LED\ncompared with the type-I LED. The 3.7 increase in the ra-\ndiative efficiency of the type-II LED compared to 1.7 in the\ncase of the type-I is experimental indication that Auger pro-\ncesses are more important for the type-II LED compared to\nthe type-I LED. However, it is well known that a type-II\nstructure reduces the overlap between electron and hole\nwavefunction since the carriers are delocalized. This should\nresult in a reduction of the Auger coefficient C in type-II\nstructures compared to type I. However, our results indicate\nstronger Auger suppression with applied pressure for type-II\nrather than type-I structures. However, the effective width of\nthe recombination zone within the active region of the\ntype-II LED, (deff) is significantly smaller. Because of\ntype-II band edge alignment, the injected carriers become\nlocalized near the interface, and the electrons and holes must\ntunnel through potential barriers to the left\/right of the con-\nfinement regions before recombining with each other. There-\nfore, the value of deff is essentially determined by these tun-\nFIG. 3.

Redistribution subject tneling distances, and we estimate a value of deff;150 \u00c5. We\nsuppose that, although type-II recombination across the\nInAs\/InAsSbP interface reduced the Auger coefficient C, the\ninjected carrier concentration is actually greater than that\nfound in the type-I LED due to the small recombination vol-\nume localized near the interface. As Auger processes are\nstrongly dependent on injected carrier concentration ~in-\ncrease as n3), the net result is an overall increase in the\nAuger rate (Cn3). We may then correctly interpret the stron-\nger increase in the light output as a function of pressure for\nthe type-II LED compared to the type-I LED as being asso-\nciated with Auger suppression.\nFinally, in type-II quantum wells, we find from theory\nthat the radiative and Auger recombination coefficients de-\npend on the band gap as B}Eg\n2 and C}Eg\n25.5\n, respectively,\nand that ~at zero applied pressure! B510210 cm3\/s and C\n58310227 cm6\/s.7 This gives the radiative contribution to\nthe current density as 14% at P50 and 40% at P\n59.4 kbar. Simple estimates predict an increase of about\n2.85 in light output when the pressure is increased from 0 to\n9.4 kbar at constant current (I5140 mA). This is approxi-\nmately in agreement with the value of 3.74 obtained experi-\nmentally.
