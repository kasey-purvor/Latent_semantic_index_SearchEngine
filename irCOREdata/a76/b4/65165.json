And yet,\nthis article demonstrates, it is not the case that law recedes as risk advances, but rather that law\npotentially both authorizes and contests specific modes of risk management.

INTRODUCTION: \u2018POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS PEOPLE\u2019\nIn May 2007, the US Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, addressed\nthe European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.\nAmidst widespread European disquiet as to the deployment by US authorities of\npassenger name record (PNR) data for the pre-emptive risk scoring of air passengers\n\u2217 Louise Amoore is Reader in Political Geography, Department of Geography, University of Durham. She leads\nthe \u2018Contested Borders\u2019 and \u2018Data Wars\u2019 projects, funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council\n(ESRC).\n1 M. Foucault, Security, Territory, Population: Lectures at the Colle`ge de France 1977\u20131978, trans. G. Burchell (2007),\n99.\n2 M. Chertoff, \u2018Remarks to European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Justice, Civil Liberties and Home\nAffairs\u2019, US Department of Homeland Security, 15 May 2007, available at www.dhs.gov\/xnews\/\nspeeches\/sp_1180627041914.sthm.\n848 LOUISE AMOORE\nentering theUnited States, Chertoff sought to place emphasis not on the question of\nthe juridical grounds of the transnational extradition of data on European citizens,\nbut on the establishment of norms and practices of risk management.3 Indeed,\nduring his visit to Europe, Chertoff was reported to have proffered a somewhat\nstark choice to the British government, between on the one hand the authorization\nof norms of data mining for the risk management of air passengers and on the\nother the withdrawal of the legal entitlement to visa waiver from some British\ncitizens.FollowingtheapparentfoilingofatransatlanticaircraftbombplotinAugust\n2006, Chertoff discussed with the UK Home Office the intention to withdraw the\nright of visa waiver from \u2018British citizens of Pakistani origin\u2019 \u2013 categorizing British\ncitizenship into degrees of risk, singling out those \u2018potentially dangerous people\u2019 to\nwhom \u2018we should pay greater attention\u2019.4\nThe alternative to what would be, in effect, the drawing of a legal exception to\nthe exception of visa waiver, has emerged in the form of an apparently extra-legal\nadministrative complex of fused public and private data mining. \u2018We use this data\u2019,\nargues Chertoff, \u2018to focus on behaviour, not race and ethnicity. In fact, it allows us to\nmove beyond crude profiling based on prejudice, and to look at actual conduct.\u20195 Of\ncourse, arguably a risk-based system that is \u2018not racial profiling\u2019 but that classifies\npast travel or remittances to Pakistan and specific name algorithms, among many\nother associations as identifiers of \u2018potentially dangerous people\u2019, is precisely the\nwithdrawal of the right to visa waiver by other means.\nThe deal struck between the US and UK governments, to accept \u2018screening at\ntheir end, sharing intelligence with the Americans\u2019 and \u2018deporting Britons who\nfailed screening once they arrived at an airport in the US\u2019, leaves the mask of the\nlegal category of visa waiver in place, while allowing the use of risk norms and\ncategories to proliferate.6 It is this institution of risk practices in advance of, and\nin place of, juridical decision that has become the technical resolution of choice to\nthe politics of targeted security in the war on terror. At the time of writing, new\nmemoranda of understanding governing the terms of the granting ofUS visawaiver\nto European citizens are being signed. One might say that, once instituted, such\nmeasures surpass and supersede all political and juridical debates on PNR or data\n3 InMay 2006 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that \u2018the CommissionDecision of 14May 2004 on the\nadequate protection of personal data contained in the PassengerNameRecord of air passengers transferred to\ntheUSBureauofCustomsandBorder Protectionbe annulled\u2019 (Case 318\/04,EuropeanParliament v. Commission\nof the EuropeanCommunities), and that \u2018theCouncil decisionof 17May2004on the conclusionof anagreement\nbetween the European Community and the United States on the transfer and processing of PNR data be\nannulled\u2019 (Case C-317\/04, European Parliament v. Council of the European Union). The Parliament had sought to\nchallenge the extradition of personal data on European citizens under Art. 8 of the European Convention\nfor the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR): \u2018everyone has the right to respect\nfor his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. There shall be no interference by a public\nauthority with the exercise of this right, except such as is necessary in a democratic society in the interests\nof national security.\u2019 The ECJ did not uphold the infringement of Art. 8, basing its judgment instead on the\ninadequate legal basis in the European Treaty.\n4 M.

The text of the agreements reveals the legal authorizations\nrequired inorder for apparently extra-legal practices andprocedures tobe instituted:\n\u2018section 711 of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9\/11 Commission Act of\n2007 reforms the visa waiver program, expanding opportunities for participation\nin the program subject to certain enhanced security requirements\u2019.7 Such enhanced\nsecurity measures are outlined as \u2018information exchange, screening information to\ncombat terrorism and serious crime, general information on migration matters\u2019,\nand \u2018allowing for further dissemination of transferred information within the US\nGovernment\u2019. The screening and risk scoring of information \u2018in advance of travel\u2019,\nlimitless at least insofar as \u2018the US Secretary of Homeland Security deems it ne-\ncessary\u2019, will determine the \u2018eligibility of a citizen to travel to the US without a\nvisa\u2019 or \u2018whether the citizen poses a law enforcement or security risk\u2019.8 In sum, the\njuridical designation of exceptions to the visa waiver clears space for multiple and\nproliferating riskpractices that defer sovereigndecisions\u2013oncitizenship, eligibility,\ndeportation, and so on \u2013 into a discretionary complex.\nThe controversy of European extradition of data to the United States \u2013 as well as\nits subsequent ebbing away into apparently extra-legal, even apolitical, procedures\n(\u2018this is not profiling\u2019; \u2018private companies handle your data this way every day\u2019, and\nso on) \u2013 is but one glimpse of a broader set of difficulties in how we have come to\nunderstand the relationship between law and norm. For, as law becomes ever more\nclosely intertwined with a proliferating assemblage of expertise, risk consulting,\nadministration, and discretion, it inhabits an inescapable paradox. On the one hand,\nlaw represents established rules, rights, and judgments \u2013 the \u2018rule of law\u2019, \u2018which\nrests absolutelywitheveryvalid legislativeactandconsists in theproductionof legal\neffects\u2019.9 For many legal activists, as for civil liberties and human rights lawyers, it\nis precisely the defence of this rule of law that is most at stake in the challenging of\napparent \u2018suspensions\u2019 such as those in the US Patriot Act. As lawyer and director of\nthe Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Marc Rotenberg put it, \u2018the EPIC\njuridical programme is inmanyways not radical at all, but profoundly conservative.\nAt least to the extent that it seeks to protect lawmade in Congress some thirty years\nago.\u201910 In this sense one might suggest, even if superficially, that law is engaged in\nthe contestation of \u2018counter laws\u2019 that represent its own suspension.11 And yet it\nis precisely law and juridical designation that make possible the authorization of\njudgments by other means that appear to us as extra-legal: a risk classification that\nrevokes the rights of a citizen, an algorithmic judgement that places a person on\na \u2018selectee list\u2019 for secondary security checks. Understood this way, it is not strictly\nthe case that, as Foucault says, \u2018law recedes\u2019, but that \u2018acts that do not have the\n7 Department of Homeland Security, \u2018Memorandum of understanding regarding the US VisaWaiver Program\nand enhanced security measures\u2019 (2008).\n8 Ibid., at 3.\n9 G.

It is not the case that \u2018law recedes\u2019 as risk\nadvances, but rather that law itself authorizes a specific and particular mode of risk\nmanagement.\nAs a consequence of the particular modern entanglement of law and norm, the\nlegalcontestationof riskmeasures institutedasdiscretionaryadministrativeauthor-\nity faces a quite specific set of problematics. Understood as a technique of governing,\nrisk isuncertaintymadecertain. That is to say, it acts on theuncertain future inaway\nthat undercuts law\u2019s conventional reliance on precedent, evidence, and judgement\nin the present. Risk technologies, as they have emerged in the contemporarywar on\nterror, favour instead the rendering of pre-emptive decisions that do not calculate\nprobability on the basis of past evidence, but rather on the horizon of what may\nhappen in the future.13 The risk calculus, then, has distinct and specific implications\nfor international law, making possible an array of interventions \u2013 from detention,\ndeportation, or \u2018secondary\u2019 security to asset freezing and \u2018blacklisting\u2019 \u2013 that operate\nin place of, and in advance of, the legal thresholds of evidence and decision.14\nIn the sections that follow, I begin bymapping the contours of the contemporary\nrisk\u2013norm\u2013lawcomplex, thenmove toexplore themeansbywhich specific contem-\nporaryriskpracticesundercutthegroundsforhistorical legal intervention:evidence,\nthe judgement of the expert witness, and the legal subject as bearer of rights are all\nreoriented in a risk regime that acts pre-emptively and authorizes with indefinite\nand indeterminate limits. It is my argument that the law, as it becomes inextricably\nbound up with novel administrative and discretionary risk practices, is confronted\nwith something of the contingency and fragility of its own essence, its own essential\ncategories. To be clear, it is not the case that the scope for critical international legal\nintervention is entirely eradicated. After all, there can be little doubt that it is often\nby means of law and legal intervention that the normalization of risk practices is\nbrought to public attention and made extraordinary. Indeed, in the absence of the\nlegal challenges to practices of pre-emptive data mining, many of which actually\nrevealed previously concealed security practices, would there be space for public\nengagement with the use of risk techniques in the war on terror? In the process of\ncontesting thegrowingubiquityof riskprofiling, scoring, and screening, though, the\nlaw must confront its own paradox. As Mariana Valverde and Nikolas Rose suggest\nin their powerful genealogy of law and norm, \u2018the codes, instruments and practices\nof law have functioned to extend the powers of administration over life in the name\nof reason\u2019, and yet at the same time, \u2018the discourse of rights and legality have been\ndeployed as a principal critique of the extension of such rationalized powers over\n12 Agamben, supra note 9, at 38.\n13 See L.

RISK, NORM, AND LAW\nAs a means of making an uncertain and unpredictable world appear amenable to\nmanagement, the idea of risk has historically had a close and complex relationship\nwiththeprinciplesandpracticesoflaw.Thus, forexample, theearlymodernpractices\nof life insurance \u2013 placing a wager on the merchant voyager\u2019s risk of death \u2013 were\ntransformed into the rational calculations of actuarial practice by legal judgments\nand prohibitions on gambling on life.16 Similarly, the nineteenth-century risks of\nworkaccident, sickness,or fatalitywererenderedmanageablebythejuridicaldevices\nof labour law, insurance, and benefit.17 Understood in these terms, both risk and\nlaw have come to be ways of governing human life via calculation, judgment, and\ndecision,asthoughtheveryunknowabilityanduncertaintyofthefutureworldcould\nbe brought into the purview ofmanageability in the present. As for Franc\u00b8ois Ewald,\n\u2018a technology of risk is a means of disassembling, reconstructing, and organizing\ncertain elements of reality\u2019.18 Risk, then, is a \u2018manufactured uncertainty\u2019, a way\nin which \u2018we govern and are governed\u2019.19 It is a promise that we may \u2018confront\nthe world of lived experience (and all of its terrors), with the more neutral and\npredictable world of risk\u2019.20\nIn the context of post-9\/11 worlds, however, the historical fungibility and con-\ntingency of risk, and its relation to law, have somewhat fallen away from analyses\nof the world and our place within it. In Ulrich Beck\u2019s reading, for example, the\n\u2018world risk society\u2019 reaches its limit when science and law can no longer respond to\nthe proliferation of \u2018potentially catastrophic and uninsurable events\u2019.21 For Richard\nEricson and Aaron Doyle, a similar risk limit is reached in a \u2018terrorism that strikes\nat the heart of risk society\u2019, rendering past ways of taming chance and uncertainty\nimpossible, and presenting \u2018a stark reminder of the limits to risk assessment and\nmanagement\u2019.22 Andyet it isnot the case that risk societyhas reached its limits at the\nthreshold of a world depicted in terms of catastrophe (whether terrorism, climate\n15 M.

Because, as Ewald says, \u2018there is no\nrisk in reality\u2019, then risk exists only as a \u2018waywe have come to understand theworld\nand its problems\u2019.23 To define a world that is \u2018post-9\/11\u2019 or characterized by the \u2018war\non terror\u2019, then, is not to reach the limits of risk at all, but to come to understand\ntheworld deployingnovel risk technologieswithnewand startling implications for\nlaw.24\nIn the incorporation of risk management into contemporary security practice,\nthe sheer unpredictability or incalculability of terrorist attack has not led, then, to\nthe placing of limits on risk. On the contrary, it has made radical uncertainty the\nvery basis for action via risk calculations. Thus, for example, Ron Suskind\u2019s account\nof the post-9\/11 Bush administration\u2019s \u2018one per cent doctrine\u2019 positions the risk of\ncatastrophe as the essence of a security decision: \u2018if there is a one per cent chance of\nan event coming due, act as though itwere a certainty\u2019.25 In effect, the precautionary\nprinciple is brought into security practice, \u2018inviting one to anticipate what one does\nnot know\u2019 and making decisions \u2018not in a context of certainty, nor even available\nknowledge, but of doubt, premonition, foreboding, fear and anxiety\u2019.26 In contrast\nto risk models that seek to prevent or to predict, then, those dominating security\ndomains are pre-emptive \u2013 they function precisely by allowing movement, permit-\nting life to play out. In his identification of risk as central to the security apparatus,\nMichel Foucault describes \u2018the emergence of a completely different problem\u2019 that\norientates itself to \u2018allowing circulations to take place, controlling them, sifting\nthe good and the bad, ensuring things are always in movement\u2019.27 Integral to the\nidea of risk is the always already present possibility to govern on the very basis of\nuncertainty \u2013 via \u2018differential risks\u2019, \u2018risk zones\u2019, \u2018different curves of normality\u2019.28\nJust as the designation of emergency or exception does not suspend the deploy-\nment of risk as ameans of governing, so the space of exceptiondepicted byAgamben\nis not as \u2018empty\u2019, \u2018anomic\u2019, or \u2018kenomatic\u2019 as he suggests.29 As Fleur Johns has argued\nin relation to Guanta\u00b4namo Bay, although the security measures and violence may\n\u2018imply an extra-legal status\u2019, in fact the detainees held there have \u2018been the focus\nof painstaking work of legal classification\u2019.30 Far from a designation of exception\nthat suspends international law, we see a space that teems with the classifications,\ncategories, and judgements of \u2018petty sovereigns\u2019 or \u2018experts inunease\u2019,whose actions\nare authorized in and through law itself.31 The \u2018elaborate, multi-stage screening\nand evaluation process\u2019 of Guanta\u00b4namo, as described by Johns, is in fact precisely\n23 Ewald, supra note 18, at 199.\n24 L.

Far from being an empty or anomic space, the\ncontemporary assemblage of law, risk, and norm abounds with the drawing of sov-\nereign lines, the designation of citizenship and degrees of citizenship \u2013 all of which\nrely on amobile form of norm\/anomaly in order to differentiate and discriminate.\nIn pre-emptive modes of risk management, though, and in contradiction to the\nidea of anomic space, the norm governs in a specific way and with quite partic-\nular implications for law. For Ewald, the norm represents a \u2018means of producing\nthe common standard, a rule for common judgement that makes law possible in\nmodern societies\u2019.34 In the contemporary war on terror, meanwhile, we are seeing\nthe emergence of a more mobile form of norm than that which Ewald identifies\nwith prudential or insurance-led modes of risk. In contrast to a common standard\nor rule, the norm extends into domains of adjudicating on suspicions, identifying\nanomaly, verifying the movements and transactions of the ordinary, and designat-\ning the threshold of the out of the ordinary. As Foucault explains with regard to\nrisk and the security apparatus, while disciplinary relations of law to norm \u2018started\nfrom a norm\u2019 such that \u2018the normal could be distinguished from the abnormal\u2019,\nwe see instead \u2018the plotting of the normal and the abnormal . . . the interplay of\ndifferential normalities\u2019.35 Thus, for example, in the advancement of risk scoring\nand data mining of airline passengers and border-crossers, the common standard or\nrule of immigration norms is overridden by amobile deployment of norm\/anomaly\nderived from associations made inside integrated databases. In this sense, it is not\nstrictly the norm that insinuates itself inside contemporary legal complexes, but\nrather processes of differentiated normalization that always fall short of and exceed\nthe norm as common standard. Indeed, a key concern of legal activists seeking to\ncontest risk profiling is that the population targeted cannot know the norm against\nwhich theywill be judged.36 Put simply, pre-emptive risk practices reserve the right\nalways to apply differential \u2018common standards\u2019, normalities, and anomalies.\n32 SeeL.Amoore, \u2018BiometricBorders:GoverningMobilities in theWaronTerror\u2019, (2006)25 (3)PoliticalGeography\n336;M.

The\nfragile and mutable nature of such categories as rights to \u2018a private life\u2019 or \u2018human\ndignity\u2019, in truth always present in legal struggles for recognition, are cast in sharp\nrelief by novel emerging complexes of law, risk, and norm.37 The discourse of rights\nand justice \u2013 historically deployed both to extend and to contest legal\u2013normal\ncomplexes\u2013nowfinds itself implicatedby itsproximity torisk, andyetalsouniquely\nsituated topriseopenspace forpublic engagement.What, then, are theprecise forms\nand modalities taken by contemporary juridical complicity in, and contestation of,\nrisk practices?\n3. EVIDENCE AND THE EXPERT WITNESS\nIn December 2006 a data-driven risk-screening programme, the \u2018Automated Target-\ningSystem\u2019 (ATS),deployedbyUSauthorities toscreenatall air, land,andseaborders,\nbecame the subject of public and legal debate. Initially developed for the specific\npurpose of assigning risk scores to cargo and container shipments into US ports of\nentry, screening imported goods in advance of their arrival at theUS border, the ATS\nhad been exported in full to the risk management of people at the border. As the\nDepartment of Homeland Security\u2019s privacy impact assessment for ATS reveals, the\nrisk-based screening is thought to enable the \u2018identification of previously unknown\nareas of note, concern or pattern\u2019.38 ATS analyses an array of data on passengers\nand border-crossers \u2013 including address, financial records, \u2018no show\u2019 history, how\ntickets were purchased, motor vehicle records, past instances of one-way travel, and\nseating and meal preferences \u2013 in order to assign a risk score to individuals. The\nscore is used for a variety of purposes, including determiningwhether a person is to\nbe placed on a \u2018selectee list\u2019 for further scrutiny, stopped for additional questioning,\nor, indeed, denied entry and deported. The risk-assessment calculation is classified\nand the results may be kept on file for up to forty years.\nATS represents but one example of an emerging complex of law, risk, and norm\nthat is disturbing juridical conceptions of evidence and expert judgement, as well\nas international legal conceptions of responsibility and accountability. In effect,\nATS deploys evidence before the fact and in advance of a future event that may or\nmay not come to pass. As the precautionary principlemigrates to security contexts,\ncivil liberties and human rights lawyers confront the problem of data deployed\nas evidence of the unknown. Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s by now infamous comments on\ngetting inside the \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019 led him to conclude that \u2018the absence\nof evidence is not evidence of absence\u2019.39 It is precisely this assumption \u2013 that\n37 C.

According to Barry Steinhardt\nof the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), ATS casts suspicion on millions of\ninnocent travellers,while seriously threateningprivacy and constitutional liberties.\nBecause the systemscreens entirepopulations in the search for \u2018unknownterrorists\u2019,\ndeploying a calculation that can never itself be made visible, people can never\nmeaningfully access, challenge, or correct their risk category. \u2018Does the government\nget to scrutinize every address at which you\u2019ve ever lived?\u2019, asks Steinhardt, \u2018quiz\nyou about the fact that you once went 12 months without a job? About your web\nsurfing, your online book purchases, your school transcripts, your associations?\u201940\nSimilar concerns are raised by the senior counsel of EPIC, Melissa Ngo. \u2018You can\nnever really know what is in this risk score, or how to get off a \u201cwatch list\u201d\u2019, she\nargues; \u2018citizens ask us this every day, will they ever tell you that you are or are not\non a list? It is now seven hundred thousand names\u2019.41 For the EPIC lawyers filing\ncomplaints on ATS, the mobile and amorphous nature of the norm of evidence\ndeployed is a crucial problem:\nThe sharp departure after 9\/11 was to move from individualised surveillance to mass\nsuspicion. In other words, governments always had tools to pursue individuals who\nwere considered to be criminals or terrorists, but the understanding was that those\ninvestigations would be pursued based on targeted leads. The real erosion has been\naround the legal frameworks \u2013 it is a movement away from a targeted approach to\nestablishing guilt, to a broad presumption that everyone may be a little bit guilty or a\nlittle bit terrorist inclined. That is the significance of the automated targeting system.\nThey runaseriesofquestions . . . it is averyodd thing for ademocratic country toassign\nto people a probability of committing a terrorist act, even if it is a low probability.42\nThe rise of pre-emptive risk calculations as a means of identifying vulnerable\nspacesandsuspiciouspopulations inthewaronterror, then,hasredefinedbydegrees\nthe threshold of evidence required to make a security decision. Thus, for example,\nas Marieke de Goede has argued, the threshold for the freezing of financial assets\nor the monitoring of financial transactions is considered to be much lower than\nthat for other forms of detention, and yet such actions have similar effects in terms\nof limiting life chances and withholding the means to a sustainable way of life.43\nLikewise,BernardHarcourtsuggests that theracialprofilingofyoungMuslimmenin\ntheLondonUndergroundandtheNewYorksubway,whilstprohibited inestablished\njuridicalmodels, is authorized innew formsby a supposition of suspicion in thewar\non terror. Citing Paul Sperry of Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution, Harcourt illustrates\nhowmodels of risk expertise from commercial contexts have come to be authorized\nin and through law: \u2018it makes no sense to search old ladies or children; the police\nshould target the high-risk population.

That\u2019s just smart business. Likewise, profiling subway\npassengers based on proven security risk is just smart law enforcement\u2019.44\nThediffusionof authority into a legal complex that incorporatesprivate commer-\ncial expertise, aswell as the assumption of \u2018smart security\u2019, ismirrored also in \u2018smart\nborders\u2019 programmes suchasATS.Assistant SecretaryofHomelandSecurity Stewart\nBaker, speaking on the ATS programme, offers risk-based screening as an objective,\nneutral, and expert-led system that means that \u2018grandmothers and infants move\nmore quickly through security\u2019, while others are screened in for a \u2018closer look\u2019.45 The\nracial profiling and identity associations that are made inside the risk calculation\nare, of course, concealed by the appeal to techno-science.46 The evidential basis for\nthe designation of norm and anomaly is link analysis, an algorithmic model that\nlooks for associations and flags risk on the basis of the links between data. In this\nway, pre-emptive risk screening makes the case for evidence deployed before the\nfact:\nThis is a lesson we learned from September 11. After-the-fact reviews of the hijackers\ntravel reservations showed thatwemighthavebeenable touncover theplot ifwe\u2019dhad\nbetter computer systems and better access to travel data . . .We didn\u2019t connect those\ndots before 9\/11, but we should have. We learned that lesson, and now ATS allows us\nto look for these links.47\nThe connecting of dots celebrated by Baker is exactly the work of link analysis\ndeployed across integrated databases. The 9\/11 commission documents are replete\nwith references to the need to \u2018connect the dots\u2019 in order to provide evidence before\nthe event. Indeed, private commercial models for connecting dots \u2013 such as those\ndeveloped by IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Raytheon, and Accenture, and later deployed\ninmajor contracts tomanageUS andUKborders \u2013were reported by the commission\nas ameans bywhich \u2018the events of 9\/11 could have been anticipated and prevented\u2019.\nThe representation of evidence before the event as the solution to catastrophe risk\nin the war on terror has cleared substantial space for expert models of calculation.\nAs Valverde and Rose note, in historical context \u2018a plurality of different forms of\nexpertise have attached themselves to the institutions and procedures of the law\u2019.48\nAt historical moments when law turns to expertise to authorize legal judgments\nand decision, it reconsiders the basis of legal evidence. It becomes possible, then, for\nexpert risk managers to claim that the evidence for the events of 9\/11 was already\npresent before the attack, indeed, that if their procedures and risk judgements were\n44 B.

Consider, by\nway of example, the case for datamining and biometric identifiersmade byMichael\nChertoff to the European Parliament:\nIn June 2003, using PNR data and other analytics, one of our inspectors at Chicago\u2019s\nO\u2019Hare airport pulled aside an individual for secondary inspection and questioning.\nWhen the secondary officers were not satisfied with his answers they took his fin-\ngerprints and denied him entry to the United States. The next time we saw those\nfingerprints \u2013 or at least parts of them \u2013 they were on the steering wheel of a suicide\nvehicle that blew up and killed 132 people in Iraq.52\nThe spectacular nature of the presentation of evidence \u2013 its intricate staging and\nperformance\u2013 iswrit large inChertoff\u2019s appeal tonew formsoffingerprint evidence.\nThe conventional scene of crime fingerprint evidence, itself historically authorized\nby science and expertise, is invoked here to authenticate the biometric used to\nmake a pre-emptive judgement at the border. Evidence at the threshold of unknown\nfutures, although prevalent in novel forms in contemporary security practice, is\nactually authorized inways that are not dissimilar to the commonplace and prosaic\nwork of legal representations ofwhat counts as evidence.\n4. DIGITIZED DISSECTION AND THE LEGAL SUBJECT\nIn 2005 the UK Home Office and the US Transportation Security Administration\n(TSA) began trials of new X-ray devices for the screening of bodies at border cross-\nings. Rapiscan System\u2019s \u2018Backscatter\u2019 scanners appeared in Terminal 4 of London\u2019s\nHeathrowairport and inPhoenix\u2019s SkyHarbor airport, producing screened imagesof\npassenger\u2019s naked bodies as they passed through security checkpoints. In the TSA\u2019s\nbudget statement to Congress in 2007, special mention wasmade of the substantial\ninvestment in \u2018Whole Body Imaging\u2019 or \u2018Backscatter X-ray\u2019, with a statement that\n\u2018the technology produces an image to identify contraband secreted on an individual\n49 See E. Morgan, \u2018New Evidence: The Aesthetics of International Law\u2019, (2005) 18 LJIL 163.\n50 M. Foucault,Abnormal: Lectures at the Colle`ge de France 1974\u20131975, trans. G.

Proposed for use in allmajor US\nand UK airports, as well as in the London Underground system in the form of milli-\nmetre wave technology, Backscatter mirrors and reflects the risk-based data mining\nofpre-emptiveborder controls. Ineffect, thepersonexperiencesadoubled fracturing\nof their sense of identity \u2013 a digitized dissection made inside integrated databases\nand then visualized projection at the border. So the fractured subject derived from\nrisk-based data mining arrives at the border before the person, who is then further\ndenuded by risk visualization technologies such as Backscatter.\nThe response to Backscatter by human rights and civil liberties lawyers has\ncentredonthequestionofrights toprivacyandhumandignity.EPIC\u2019sseniorcounsel,\nfor example, has argued that Backscatter scans are \u2018equivalent to a \u201cvirtual strip\nsearch\u201d for all air travellers\u2019, and that the machines show \u2018extraordinary disregard\nfor the privacy rights\u2019 of passengers. The central critical juridical questions have\nbecome how, or whether, images collected and seen on the screen can be made to\ncomply with data protection laws, and whether there is adequacy in the treatment\nof data by public authorities:\nThey\u2019re designed to capture images, and TSA made some very misleading statements\nearly on about how they were showing operators only chalk lines and all these other\nways to obscure the image, which basically has nothing to do with what\u2019s being\nrecorded by the device. We pressed that issue with them and now they have given us\nsome assurances that they\u2019re in fact not going to be saving these images but of course\nthe devices are intended, designed to save the images. Howwill they be used, bywhom,\nwith what safeguards to privacy?53\nThe claim to rights to privacy, bodily integrity, or human dignity, however, faces\nparticular difficulties in relation to risk technologies that dissect and fragment the\nperson into a series of risk factors. What happens to the legal subject when risk\nvisualizations \u2013 extending from imaging devices such as Backscatter to the screened\nvisual displays of risk scores \u2013 specifically divide and subclassify the body into\ndifferential traits, characteristics, behaviours? What are the limits of the citizen\u2019s\nobligation to reveal the elements, the prosaic daily intimacy of their lives? As Engin\nIsin has argued compellingly, the \u2018neurotic citizen\u2019, once reduced to a \u2018species body\u2019,\nactively stripsherself downinorder to \u2018calibrate itself\u2019 to theanxieties anddangersof\nthe border.54 Thus, the very category of legal subject, or indeed of citizen, is exposed\nin its full fragility. What happens to the body that cannot be verified, that does\nnot calibrate to the mobile norm, or is not recognized or is mis-recognized under\ninternational law?\nIn the contestation of risk technologies such as Backscatter, then, the law once\nmore confronts the making of its own categories. If it recognizes only a \u2018a non-\nsubstantial, a thin personality, a public image that seriously mis-matches people\u2019s\nself-image\u2019,55 then legal intervention risksmirroring the stripping-downanddenud-\ning strategies of the homeland security state itself:\n53 Interviewwith Rotenberg, supra note 10.\n54 E. Isin, \u2018The Neurotic Citizen\u2019, (2004) 8 Citizenship Studies 232.\n55 Douzinas, supra note 37, at 397.\nRISK BEFORE JUSTICE: WHEN THE LAW CONTESTS ITS OWN SUSPENSION 859\nHuman rights break down the body into functions and parts and replace its unity\nwith rights . . . Encountering rights annihilates and dismembers the body: the right to\nprivacy isolates the genital area and creates a \u2018zone of privacy\u2019 around it; free speech\nsevers the mouth and protects its communicative but not its eating function, while\nfree movement does the same with legs and feet, but offers no right of abode.56\nPut simply, the abstractions that are made in the defence of people\u2019s rights to\nprivacy, just as in the digitized imaging of the body, risk recognizing only a facsimile\nof a person. The reduction of a person to their rights recognizes, as Douzinas puts\nit, only \u2018the man of the rights of man\u2019, who appears \u2018without differentiation or\ndistinction inhisnakednessandsimplicity,unitedwithallothers inanemptynature\ndeprived of substantive characteristics\u2019.57 Certainly the nakedness of the stripped-\ndown man in the rights of man is not recognized in its full political difficulty by\nthe continual redrawing of a legal boundary. It is this redrawing that runs through\nmost of the current legal appeals to privacy: \u2018the infringement on privacy must be\nproportionate to the security threat\u2019; \u2018the collection and use of personal data must\nbe transparent\u2019; \u2018subjects must be informed if they are on a no-fly list\u2019.58 Where\nsomeone is left to make a claim for recognition based on corporeal difference \u2013 \u2018I\nam pregnant\u2019; \u2018I have a prosthetic limb\u2019; \u2018I have a mastectomy\u2019 \u2013 they are rendered\ninvisible, slipping away from the juridical domain.\nDouzinas does offer, though, one possible critical route thatmay be open to legal\nintervention and responsibility: that is, to consider the appeal to rights of many\nkinds \u2013 privacy, bodily integrity, a private family life, freedom of expression \u2013 to\nbe one specific struggle for recognition among many others, a specifically legal claim\nto human identity that is, nonetheless, always already also political and social. In\npractice, suchastruggle for recognition ispresent in theclaims, cases, andcampaigns\nof critical lawyers seeking to challenge new risk technologies. As senior counsel\nLillie Coney explains in relation to recognizing \u2018non-citizens\u2019 in border control and\nimmigration issues,\nThe idea of the non-citizen. It\u2019s very disturbing to me, because I work on civil rights\nissues, that\u2019s my background, that\u2019s where I came from. And I\u2019m doing a lot of work\nto try to bring that community into these discussions along privacy, but a lot of the\ndiscussions about non-citizens sound a lot like the discussion that occurred around\nequal rights for women, equal rights for minorities, within the United States. It can\u2019t\nbe defined strictly as civil liberties because we were talking about people who are\nnon-citizens. But we do need to start having discussions about human rights and that\nAmericans can\u2019t suspend their care of human rights if the person is a non-, is not a US\ncitizen.59\nOn theonehand, then, liberal formsof legal recognition restrict our ability to talk\nback inthe faceofnon-recognition, strippingawaythespecificitiesof family, culture,\nexperience, race, and leavingonlywhatDouzinas describes as an \u2018emptyunit\u2019.60 And\n56 Ibid., at 399.\n57 Ibid., at 398.\n58 EuropeanParliament, \u2018Findings of theArticle 29Data ProtectionWorking Party of theEuropeanParliament\u2019s\nCommittee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs\u2019, Brussels, 26 March 2007.\n59 Interviewwith Lillie Coney, senior counsel and deputy director, EPIC,Washington, DC, 31 October 2007.\n60 Douzinas, supra note 37, at 398.\n860 LOUISE AMOORE\nyet, in thestruggle for legal recognitionthere isanoscillationbackandforthbetween\nclaims to the universal, usually framed by ideas of \u2018nation\u2019, \u2018international\u2019, \u2018citizen\u2019,\neven \u2018homeland\u2019, and the specificities of the particular that defy and expose these\ncategories. The legal \u2018other\u2019 is but one of the others in front of whom we seek to\nbe recognized. \u2018The typical harm of defective recognition\u2019, as depicted by Douzinas,\nabsolutely captures the multiple projected identities and mis-recognitions of risk\nimaging and screening, where a split occurs \u2018between someone\u2019s self-image and\nthe image that social institutions or others project upon that person\u2019. If law is to\nintervene to contest this particular effect of its own suspension then it cannot avoid\nthe encounter with multiple struggles for recognition. As in Lillie Coney\u2019s legal\nadvocacy for the non-recognized, non-American communities, the grounds for legal\npersonhoodmust also come into critical reappraisal. Rather than intervene to shore\nup the completeness of legal personhood \u2013 via strict rights of privacy, dignity, and\nbodily integrity \u2013 thiswould imply precisely the opposite, a questioning of howone\nbecomes a legal subject and how one reconciles the exclusions and exceptions that\nmake this possible.\nAs the assemblages of law and norm become ever more closely bound up with\nrisk practices thatmodel, pre-empt, and visualize, there is a double bind to confront\nin the discourse of human rights. As Jacques Derrida put the problem in the week\nfollowing the events of 9\/11,\nWe must more than ever stand on the side of human rights.We need human rights. We\nare in need of them and they are in need, for there is always a lack, a shortfall, a falling\nshort, an insufficiency; human rights are never sufficient. They are not natural, they\nhave a history \u2013 one that is recent, complex and unfinished\u2019.61\nThe proliferation of risk practices that make no ethical decisions but only defer\ndecision into calculation must surely demand that we, as Derrida says, stand on\nthe side of human rights. But this necessarily juridical intervention in otherwise\ndenuded risk calculations can only proceed in full knowledge of its own historical\ncontext and contingency. Always there will be new claims that have to work from\nsome sense of aunity fromwhich they are excluded, andyet always these claimswill\ncome from difference, from a failure of the legal \u2018other\u2019 to recognize that difference.\n5. CONCLUSIONS: LAW AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT\nThe concept of pure hospitality can have no legal or political status. No state canwrite\nit into its laws.62\nI shall conclude by returning to the dilemmawith which I began \u2013 when European\nlaw intervened to prohibit data transfer for risk scoring, but authorized themultiple\nrisk practices that are set to define the granting of visa waiver. Onemight say, as the\ndomain of crime and evidence of crime becomes indistinguishable from national\nsecurity actions, that juridical intervention can only act to redraw marginally the\n61 J.Derrida, \u2018Autoimmunity: Real andSymbolic Suicides\u2019, inG.

Theremay be, as I have suggested here, a new limit, now\nmore visible than before, placed upon the capacity of law to extricate itself from the\nproliferation of discretionary norms and open public space for contestation. And\nyet, could it be that the inextricable binding together of legal practicewithnon-legal\nformsof expertise, thoughundeniably takingviolent formsandhavingmaterial and\nbarbaric effects on the life chances of people, also contains the potentiality for its\nownundoing?Although it is not the case that law is contesting its own suspension \u2013\nfor, as I have suggested, it is by nomeans suspended \u2013 there are instances where it is\nat least suspending reliance on conventional categories of rights and justice.\nIf law depends so readily on the mask of representational practices of \u2018evidence\u2019,\n\u2018rights\u2019, the \u2018legal subject\u2019, then its entanglement with risk technologies that pro-\nfoundly shake those categories is having material and political effects. Across the\ndifferent examples of legal contestation of risk technologies I have explored, there is\na struggle for recognition that somehow demands a personhood that is more than a\nrisk calculus, that exceeds the categories of safe and dangerous. In pressing the ques-\ntions ofwhat counts as evidence,whodecides,who is the rightful legal subject,what\nis the threshold for security decisions, law confronts the contingency and frailty of\nits owngrounds for judgement. There is a distinctive ambiguity, then, in the relation\nbetween justice and the possibilities for a transformative ethics of the recognition of\npersonhood. As William Connolly captures the ethico-political practices of public\nengagement, there is potential \u2018in a modern world of justice\u2019 for suffering to move\nfrom obscurity \u2018below the register of justice\u2019 to a visible \u2018unmarked place on it\u2019.64\nThus the \u2018non-citizens\u2019 unrecognized by strictly \u2018civil\u2019 liberties haunt the terrain of\nrights and struggle for an unmarked place upon it. Can law foster a hospitality to\nthe unknown, the unexpected and unanticipated arrival of a legal subject whom it\ndoes not recognize? Do the risk practices that categorize personhood at the horizon\nof unknown futures encounter a limit in modes of law that respond differently to\nthe unknown subject?\n63 E.
