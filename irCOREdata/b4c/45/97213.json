Introduction. The HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) epidemic has been\nevolving in India since the first case was detected in Tamil Nadu in 1986. Based\non the sentinel surveillance data, the estimated number of HIV-infected persons\nhas gone up from 3.5 million in 1998 to over 5.206 million in 2005 accounting for\none eighth of all infections in the world [43]. These estimates indicate that there\nhas been no dramatic upsurge in the spread of HIV infection across the country\nsince 1998. However, state-specific variations in the profile of the epidemic have\nbeen observed. Several states in southern India and the north-eastern part of the\ncountry have shown higher HIV prevalence and diversity in predominant patterns\nof HIV transmission. Even low HIV-prevalence states are characterized by the\npresence of high-risk pockets with potential for increased spread of the epidemic in\nthese states. HIV infection during the 80s and 90s reflects an increase in the number\nof AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) patients and consequent medical,\neconomic, and social implications. The epidemic in India is very heterogeneous with\ndiverse modes of infection, particularly in the southern and western states of Tamil\nNadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra, and the two north-eastern\nstates of Nagaland and Manipur. Even within states, there is a wide variance\nTHE THIRD PHASE INDIAN HIV\/AIDS POLICY: MATHEMATICAL MODELS 781\nin HIV prevalence between and within districts as evidenced by data from HIV\nsentinel surveillance sites and Voluntary Counseling and Testing Centers (VCTC).\nInformation from AIDS case reporting indicates that sex continues to be the main\nroute (86 percent) of transmission in most parts of the country. Blood products,\ninjecting drug use, and perinatal transmission from mother to child are the other\nroutes. Injecting drug use is the predominant route of transmission in the north\neastern states of India. India has mounted a response to the HIV epidemic through\ntwo NACPs (National AIDS Control Programmes, called NACP I and NACP II).\nThe third phase of the program was initiated in early 2007 (we call this NACP III).\nThe modeling exercise is undertaken to assist the NACO (National AIDS Control\nOrganization) and NACP III planning teams to realize a realistic scenario in the\nsetting of the new initiatives undertaken during the project period from 2006 to\n2011. One of the novel features of NACP III modeling is to take into account\nPositive Prevention Strategy (i.e., preventive measures of HIV infected people).\nIncorporation of this strategy is a major advancement over NACP II strategies.\nModels are introduced in Section 3 and details of methods involved are in Ap-\npendices I to V.\n2. Background and scope: Third phase policy (2006-2011). The focus of\nNACP III is to reduce new infection of HIV by 60 - 80 percent in different regions of\nIndia through prevention with care and support. The activities include greater cov-\nerage of more than 80 percent of the High Risk Population, which includes female\nsex workers, MSM (men having sex with men) and IDU (injecting drug user) with\npreventive interventions including, condom promotion, and STD (sexually trans-\nmitted diseases) treatment. This provision of care support and treatment includes\nfirst line ART (Anti-Retroviral Therapy) to all infected people, with the target of\n300,000 treated over the next five years, with effective linkage of prevention with\ncare and support so that all patients receiving care and support participate in the\nprevention activities and prevent the spread of HIV. Interventions also include vul-\nnerable and other bridge populations of STD clinic attendees, street children, young\nmen, and migrant workers. There is a programme of general IEC (information, ed-\nucation and counseling) in the general population, which includes special targeting\nof young people, women, and out of school youths, to increase awareness and knowl-\nedge of HIV and risks of transmission. This will be supported through a network\nof district based infrastructure and effective monitoring to ensure quality of service\ndelivery. The work builds on the success of the earlier programmes in India which\nhave shown that focussed effort on high risk groups (HRG) can control the epidemic,\nas demonstrated in the state of Tamil Nadu as well as in other international efforts\n(for example, Thailand and Uganda). Success is best achieved via public-private\npartnership through TIs (targeted interventions). Currently nearly 50 percent of\nthe population has been successfully targeted and the plan is to increase awareness\nto 80 percent or more of the population.\n2.1. Major routes of transmission in India. The major routes of transmission\nof HIV virus continue to be sexual (86 percent). The other routes are blood prod-\nucts, perinatal transmission, and injecting drug use. The latter is the predominant\nroute of transmission particularly in the north-eastern states of India [43]. See Fig-\nures 1 and 2 for trends of HIV estimates and prevalence in various sub-populations\nin India [37].\n782 A. S. R. S. RAO, K. THOMAS, K. SUDHAKAR AND P. K. MAINI\nFigure 1. Trends of HIV prevalence in various sub-populations.\nYear-wise HIV prevalence in the five subpopulations, namely, anti-\nnatal care population, STD, female sex workers, IDUs, and MSM,\nplotted from the data available from the HIV sentinel surveillance\nreport [38].\n2.2. Sex ratio in Indian epidemic. The infection remained limited to sex work-\ners and their clients in the early part of the epidemic and remains so in many states\nin India. However, in other states, the infection has spread from sex workers to the\ngeneral population and women are being infected by their husbands who indulge\nin high-risk behavior. The male to female ratio of infected people has shifted from\n0.55 in 2001 to 0.6 in 2006 [58] (see Figure 3).\n2.3. Groups at high risk of acquiring HIV. There are groups of individuals\nwho are at high-risk of acquiring HIV infection. These are sex workers, IDUs and\nMSM including transgender sub-populations. Other groups who are also at-risk,\ninclude: women, youth and adolescents, migrants, street children, and transport\nworkers etc. There are statistical issues that need to be addressed for estimating\nsizes of risk groups [51, 52]. NACO recently constituted an expert group to assess\nthe number of high-risk groups in the country. Table 1 provides the information re-\ngarding the high-risk group population based on best estimates and Table 2 provides\nvarious population sub-groups considered in our models.\n2.4. Knowledge and behavior. In 2001, a nationwide behavioral surveillance\nsurvey [10] was conducted to provide baseline information on the risk behavior\npatterns in the country, for both the general population and high-risk groups such\nas female sex workers and their clients, MSM, and IDUs. The survey revealed\nvariations in knowledge of HIV\/AIDS between different states and between rural\nand urban populations. While 76 percent of the Indian population had heard of\nTHE THIRD PHASE INDIAN HIV\/AIDS POLICY: MATHEMATICAL MODELS 783\nFigure 2. Trends of HIV estimates in various sub-populations.\nYear-wise HIV infection (in millions) during the period 2000 to\n2005 for various subpopulations, namely, clients attending STD\nclinics, women attending anti-natal care clinics, IDUs, female sex\nworkers, and new infection among children, plotted from data in\nthe HIV sentinel surveillance report [38].\nTable 1.

In Bihar, only 21.5 percent of the adult population and in UP only 27.6\npercent had heard of HIV\/AIDS. While 71.1 percent of Indians were aware of the\nsexual route of HIV transmission, only 18.6 percent of rural women had heard of the\nlinkage. The knowledge and behavior indicators of high-risk groups showed similar\nwide gaps.\n2.5. AIDS-related deaths. There could be moderate to severe impact of AIDS\nrelated mortality on the demographic situation in certain populations in India.\n784 A. S. R. S. RAO, K. THOMAS, K. SUDHAKAR AND P. K. MAINI\nFigure 3. Male to female ratios of HIV prevalence among STD\nclinic attendees. Ratios of male to female prevalence rates plotted\nagainst time from the STD data obtained from clinics. This figure\nis taken from the Project Implementation Plan, NACP III (2006).\nWe have modified the color shades.\nThere were modeling attempts in India that indirectly estimate excess deaths due\nto AIDS from time series data available at the municipal corporation public health\nrecords. Community prevalence surveys also indicate AIDS-related deaths in certain\nhigh-risk groups [65]. There are estimates proposed by various groups, but they did\nnot provide the methodology adopted in their estimation procedures. Since records\non AIDS-related deaths are not available for India and for each state, it is not clear\nwhat is the actual impact during the last decade of AIDS on crude death rate and\nage specific death rates. Estimations based on back-calculation suggest there were\n160,000-200,000 deaths up to 2000 since the beginning of the epidemic [53].\n2.6. Migration impact on HIV. There have been studies that documented vul-\nnerability to HIV among migrant workers in slum populations in India due to their\nlifestyle and living conditions [61]. High migration of the infected population and\ntheir mobility could be spreading the disease in some parts of India. There is a need\nto undertake more substantial studies to quantify the migration-related HIV infec-\ntions in India and for models to be developed for understanding migration impact\nat the state level.\nTHE THIRD PHASE INDIAN HIV\/AIDS POLICY: MATHEMATICAL MODELS 785\n3. Description of the non-linear deterministic models constructed for\npredicting the number of people living with HIV. Mathematical and sta-\ntistical models can serve as tools for understanding the HIV epidemic if they are\nconstructed carefully. In the past two decades dynamical models have provided\nimportant insights into infectious disease epidemiology and assisted in designing\neffective control strategies and cost analysis for HIV\/AIDS, BSE (Bovine Spongi-\nform Encephalitis), Foot and Mouth Diseases and SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory\nSyndrome). The model that we construct here uses the basic principles in AIDS\nmodeling developed by Anderson and May [2, 3] and May and Anderson [33] that\nhave been widely accepted as one of the key strategies to understand the progress\nand impact of the epidemic in different settings. There have been several modifi-\ncations to these models over the past decade to account for the impact of vaccines\nand anti-retroviral therapies. In general, dynamic modeling reflects important epi-\ndemiological and behavioral determinants of the disease and are constructed using\na mathematical framework.\nFigure 4. Sources of infection by gender. In-flow to the male\nand female HIV infection classes and route of transmission by sub-\npopulation. A male can acquire infection from any of the six in-\nfected host populations (or sub-populations) and a female can ac-\nquire infection from any of the five infected host or sub-populations.\nIn this paper, we construct ordinary differential equation models to explain the\nspread of HIV between male and female and the spread within MSM and within\nIDUs. Sexual transmission of infection between genders could be due to casual\nsex, female sex workers, male sex workers, and within married couples if one of\nthe spouses is infected. For the data in India, it was observed that expanding\neffective prevention programmes within married couples might also be responsible\nfor controlling the spread between regular partners [34]. For the purpose of the\npresent article, we briefly describe our model equations and explain the parameters\nand their interactions. General discussions on such model construction and analysis\n786 A. S. R. S. RAO, K. THOMAS, K. SUDHAKAR AND P. K. MAINI\ncan be found elsewhere [2, 14, 28, 6, 54]. In spite of prevention programmes, which\nare actively engaged in reducing the disease burden, there is a need to widen them\nand bring in more effective preventive responses [27].\nOur model for NACP III target interventions for the programme period differs\nfrom previous models in that it includes prevention measures to be launched for\ninfected people in addition to NACP II policies. We project HIV estimates based\non the three levels of targets fixed by NACP III. Various sources contributing to\ninfection for male and female populations are explained in Figure 4. The dynamic\ncompartments in the model are Si, Gi, Ii, and Di, the number of susceptibles, sex-\nually transmitted infections, HIV infecteds and AIDS cases by gender (i=1 for\nmale and i=2 for female), respectively. Male susceptibles can acquire infection\nfrom six infected sub-populations (j=1 for female marriage partner, j=2 for female\ncommercial sex partner, j=3 for female casual partner, j=4 transmission through\nblood, j=5 for MSM, j=6 for IDUs). A detailed description of the variables in the\nvarious models in this work and their terminology can also be found in Table 2.\nMSM transmissions are not acquired from females. Out of the 2,352,113 estimated\nnumber of MSM in India [38, 39], 30 per cent participate in bisexual activities and\nthe remaining 70 per cent are predominantly homosexual. We assume that MSM\ninteractions are not particularly relevant in the major mixing of the population.\nHence we have separated MSM interactions from the main model and separately\nstudied the spread of HIV among them. Although IDUs exist all over India, spread\nof infection among them is very high only in a few metropolitan cities and parts of\nnorth-eastern India [21, 67]. Very little information is available on IDUs who have\nsex partners and their role in transmission or acquisition of the virus in addition\nto that of regular IDU activity. So, we have separately considered the dynamics of\nIDU infections. Estimating subpopulation sizes and their infection levels is essential\nfor predicting accurately the future course of action for HIV control [51]. To make\nan accurate prediction, we need to estimate the population at risk of acquiring the\ninfection in various subpopulations, but identifying the representative population\nis not always straightforward (for example, due to the stigma attached). We make\nuse of the best available data obtained either from the NACP III framework [38]\nor where applicable we consider expert opinions from the task team. As better\ndata on subpopulation estimates become available, model predictions will become\nmore accurate. By raising the surveillance and spreading the programme to low-risk\ngroups and vulnerable groups, HIV estimates can be made more accurate [50]. The\nidea of estimating prevalence levels in each subpopulation at risk and summariz-\ning to obtain national estimates in concentrated and generalized epidemics is well\ndocumented [68].\nSources of infection by gender are illustrated in Figure 4, where (dark green)\nshaded regions are those interactions whose dynamics are studied separately. Female\nsusceptibles can acquire infection from five infected sub-populations (j=1 for male\nmarriage partner, j=2 for male bisexual MSM, j=3 for male casual partner, j=4\ntransmission through blood, j=5 for IDUs). For example, the combination \u201c1j\u201d in\nthe model equations represents a given male who acquired infection from the jth sub-\npopulation and similarly \u201c2j\u201d represents a given female who acquired infection from\nthe jth sub-population. Overall we have three ordinary differential equation models;\none for the total dynamics (excluding MSM and IDU), one for MSM infections, and\none for IDU infections.\nTHE THIRD PHASE INDIAN HIV\/AIDS POLICY: MATHEMATICAL MODELS 787\nTable 2.

A compartment and corresponding transmission rate are\nshown in the same color.\n788 A. S. R. S. RAO, K. THOMAS, K. SUDHAKAR AND P. K. MAINI\nThe overall schematic structure of the model is shown in Figure 5. We aim to\nanswer questions such as what proportion of reduction in HIV is due to an increase\nin ART users, an increase in positive prevention strategy or due to an increase in\ngeneral preventive measures? We base our answers on information on modes of\ntransmission of virus in India, sub-population infection levels, and mixing patterns\nbetween susceptibles and infecteds in various sub-populations. The ordinary differ-\nential equations that describe the mixing scenario in general population explained\nabove are:\nModel 1: Spread of HIV in general population\ndSi\ndt\n= riSi \u2212 f(Si, Gj , Ij ;\u03bbij , \u03b2ij) + \u03c6Gi\ndGi\ndt\n= f \u2032(Si, Gj ;\u03bbij)\u2212 g(Gi, Ij ;\u03b1ij)\u2212 \u00b5Gi \u2212 \u03c6Gi\ndIi\ndt\n= h(Si, Ij , Gi;\u03b2ij , \u03b1ij)\u2212 \u03b4iIi \u2212 \u03b3iIi (1)\ndDi\ndt\n= \u03b3iIi \u2212 \u03b4iDi.\nHere, ri is natural growth rate of susceptibles, \u00b5 is average general mortality rate,\n\u03b4i is HIV related mortality rate, \u03c6 is the rate of recovery of sexually transmitted\ninfections (STIs) (excluding HIV), \u03bb\u2032s, \u03b2\u2032s and \u03b1\u2032s are, respectively, transmission\nrates of STI, HIV from susceptibles (without STI) and STI infecteds with HIV from\nsubpopulation j of the opposite gender. \u03b3i is the disease progression parameter\nindicating the rate at which HIV infected individuals progress to AIDS. Disease\nprogression information is available for hospital based prevalent cohorts [24] and the\nrelation between CD4 counts and clinical manifestations [20] in India. Issues like\ndouble censoring (i.e., roughly missing the data from both ends of the study period)\nneed to be taken into consideration, so there were parametric and non-parametric\nmethods developed to estimate incubation periods in such data [55]. A susceptible\nindividual can acquire either STI or HIV. Therefore these susceptibles will enter into\neither the HIV compartment or the STI compartment as shown in Figure 4, and\nHIV infected individuals will progress to AIDS. The function f(Si, Gj , Ij ;\u03bbij , \u03b2ij)\naccounts for transmission of STI and HIV infections to the susceptible class at\nrates \u03bbij and \u03b2ij , respectively, from subpopulation j (the respective size of the\nsubpopulation j is Nj) of opposite gender i. The function f\n\u2032(Si, Gj ;\u03bbij) accounts for\ntransmission of STI from susceptibles and g(Gi, Ij ;\u03b1ij) accounts for transmission\nof HIV to the STI infecteds at a rate \u03b1ij and the function h(Si, Ij , Gi;\u03b2ij , \u03b1ij)\naccounts for transmission of HIV from both STI and general susceptibles class. See\nAppendix I for more details on these functions and other functions in the following\nmodels:\nTHE THIRD PHASE INDIAN HIV\/AIDS POLICY: MATHEMATICAL MODELS 789\nModel 2: Spread of HIV within MSM\ndSm\ndt\n= rmSm \u2212 fm(Sm, Gm, Im;\u03bbm, \u03b2m) + \u03c6Gm\ndGm\ndt\n= f \u2032m(Sm, Gm;\u03bbm)\u2212 gm(Gm, Im;\u03b1m)\u2212 \u00b5Gm \u2212 \u03c6Gm\ndIm\ndt\n= hm(Sm, Im, Gm;\u03b2m, \u03b1m)\u2212 \u03b4mIm \u2212 \u03b3mIm (2)\ndDm\ndt\n= \u03b3mIm \u2212 \u03b4mDm.\nThe four compartments in Model 2 are Sm, Gm, Im and Dm representing, respec-\ntively, susceptibles, STI infecteds, HIV infecteds, and full-blown disease individuals.\nHere, rm is the recruitment rate into the susceptible MSM, \u03c6 is the rate of recovery\nof STIs, \u03b4m is HIV related mortality rate, \u03bbm, \u03b2m and \u03b1m are transmission rates of\nSTI, HIV from MSM (without STI) and STI infected MSM to HIV, respectively. \u03b3m\nis the disease progression parameter indicating the rate at which HIV infected indi-\nviduals progress to AIDS. The functions fm(Sm, Gm, Im;\u03bbm, \u03b2m), f\n\u2032\nm(Sm, Gm;\u03bbm),\ngm(Gm, Im;\u03b1m) and hm(Sm, Im, Gm;\u03b2m, \u03b1m) account, respectively, for transmis-\nsion of STI and HIV infections to the susceptibles, transmission of STI to the\nsusceptibles, transmission of HIV to the STI infecteds, and transmission of HIV\nfrom both STI and general susceptibles. Limited information is available on MSM\ndata and infection rates in the country. The estimates published by various reports\nare inconsistent. We use demographic, epidemiological data given in Tables 2 and 3\nand parameter values in Table 4 (prepared for NACP III) for the present analysis.\nWe calculated the weighted average of prevalence rates from data and used these\naverage values in models for MSM and IDUs. Parameter value selection and related\nreferences can be found in Appendix II. However we note that more information on\nthe mixing, behavioral, and epidemiological parameters is required for several time\nperiods before a reliable model and subsequent trend analysis with a greater degree\nof accuracy can be obtained. Those MSM who are bisexuals will also contribute\nto infection via their spouses and the corresponding rate is preserved in Model 1.\nThe sex worker population was considered for both males and females. Some of the\nMSM are considered as sex workers.\nModel 3: Spread of HIV within IDU\ndSIDU\ndt\n= rIDUSIDU \u2212 fIDU (SIDU , IIDU ;\u03bbIDU )\ndIIDU\ndt\n= fIDU (SIDU , IIDU ;\u03bbIDU )\u2212 \u03b4IDUIIDU \u2212 \u03b3IDUIIDU (3)\ndDIDU\ndt\n= \u03b3IDUIIDU \u2212 \u03b4IDUDIDU .\nThe three compartments in Model 3 are SIDU , IIDU , and DIDU representing,\nrespectively, susceptibles, HIV infecteds, and full-blown disease individuals.

Those IDUs who are bisex-\nuals will also contribute to their spouses and the corresponding rate is considered\nin Model 1.\nWhen the interventions are triggered, the key parameters of virus transmission\nin the model equations will be affected. For example, due to an increase in condom\nusage by infected people, the transmission rate to susceptibles will be reduced.\nAt the same time, due to more preventive measures (as part of knowledge and\nbehavioral intervention) and improved health due to ART there might also be an\nincrease in sexual activity that will again result in increased contact rates between\nsusceptibles and infecteds. We used demographic data acquired from the Census of\nIndia and Sample Registration System, India tables [12, 63]. See Table 5 for NACP\nII target interventions, Table 6 for the ART scale-up plan (also see section 4), and\nTable 7 for the status of the response in NACP III ART scale-up. For various\nprogramme targets that have affected parameters, see Tables 8 and 9 (details can\nbe obtained from the NACO [40, 41, 42]). Our models developed here give spread\nof the virus in the total population. In Appendix V, we present extensions of the\nabove models that can be useful in predicting age-specific prevalence. Spread is\nnot uniform in all the age groups, and unless reliable age-specific incidence and\nprevalence estimates, and epidemiological and clinical parameters are available, it\nis difficult to assess the disease spread within various age-groups.\n4. Progamme interventions.\n4.1. Different levels of future response. The four levels of response considered\nin this paper are the following:\n1. Interventions to continue at NACP II Level\n2. Rapid scale-up anti-retroviral therapy without positive prevention\n3. Expanded coverage of high-risk groups with integration of prevention with\ncare support (50 percent target)\n4. Expanded coverage of high-risk groups with integration of prevention with\ncare support (100 percent target)\n4.2. Interventions considered in NACP II model. While NACP II has been\na successful programme in its strategy, the level of success in implementation of\nthe programme has varied in different states of India. As a result the coverage\nof high-risk groups with intervention programmes has been less than adequate (30\npercent). Even though some states have achieved a high level of behavioral change\nin the high-risk group population, the national average is that only 50 percent of\nindividuals use condoms regularly during sexual activity with non-regular partners.\nTargets used in the NACP II model are summarized in Table 4.\n4.3. Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) interventions. In NACP III there is a\nspecial emphasis on increasing ART and improving the knowledge base for those\nwho are taking treatment. There could be an increase of three to four years in the\nmedian incubation period due to the availability of ART [64]. The NACP III model\ncaptures the impact of ART interventions by decreasing the transmission rates.\nWhen ART is introduced the interaction between CD4 cells and viral particles\nreduces and as a result viral load in the body sometimes reaches a sufficiently low\nlevel such that the infected CD4 count is undetectable by normal diagnostics.

Through our model, we have estimated\nthe impact of implementing a targeted ART number (see Table 6) to the overall\nreduction in infection rates in the population. Optimizing the benefits of ART\nto the overall infected and susceptible populations is a challenging issue for the\ngovernment. It was expected that the HIV number in the general population will\ndecline if ART is introduced systematically. It was predicted that an unstructured\nTHE THIRD PHASE INDIAN HIV\/AIDS POLICY: MATHEMATICAL MODELS 793\nTable 8.

Rapid scale-up of ART without positive prevention. This scenario pre-\ndicts the outcome if NACP II activities are continued along with rapid scale-up of\nART delivery. Currently approximately 40,000 AIDS patients are on ART. Nearly\n15,000 are from the public sector programme and the rest have been initiated by dif-\nferent private sector units in the country. The government is committed to rapidly\nscale-up the ART services to those in need to 100,000 by 2007 and 184000 by 2010\nas given in Table 6.\nART influences the epidemic in different ways and its net response is complex.\nFor example,\na) ART will reduce both the viral load and transmission rate in PLHA (people\nliving with HIV\/AIDS)\nb) ART will prolong the life of PLHA and increase the chance of spread\nc) Improved quality of health can increase sexual activity of PLHA receiving\nART.\nThe net effect of this intervention will depend on whether preventive strategies\ntarget PLHA to produce behavioral change. This scenario illustrates the potential\nnegative effect of ART on the HIV epidemic if positive prevention strategies are not\ninitiated while scaling up is accomplished. These assumptions result in decreasing\nprotection to susceptibles, increasing partners, increased contact rate (due to im-\nprovement in health due to ART), and eventually an increase in transmission rates\nfrom infecteds to susceptibles.\n4.5. Integrating care and support in NACP III. Three scenarios (50 percent,\n75 percent, and 100 percent targets) are analyzed to investigate the possible outcome\nif expanded coverage of high-risk groups including female sex workers, IDU, MSM\nto 90% with targeted intervention is achieved along with integration of care support\nand treatment with prevention strategies. The scale-up of ART is achieved with\nfocus on positive prevention. See Table 6 for details.\n5. Revised estimation of HIV burden (2007). The surveillance system has\nalso provided an excellent opportunity for NACO to estimate the HIV burden in\nIndia. The assumptions and analytical tools have also evolved over the years and\n794 A. S. R. S. RAO, K. THOMAS, K. SUDHAKAR AND P. K. MAINI\nthe NACO\u2019s programmatic initiatives have expanded substantially. This process\nhas helped to gain better understanding of the epidemic and make necessary ad-\njustments. Additional information on high-risk groups, data from health care de-\nlivery points, and other behavioral studies have also provided greater insights in\nunderstanding the patterns and trends of the epidemic at national and state levels.\nAccordingly, the NACO has been estimating the total number of people living with\nHIV\/AIDS in India since 1998 and sharing the information nationwide. In 2005, the\nNACO had projected the total number of PLHA at 5.2 million. The results of the\nHIV sentinel surveillance round of 2006, National Family Health Survey-3 (NFHS-3)\nand Integrated Behavioral and Biological Assessment (IBBA) have enabled the pro-\ngramme to create a robust database, conduct sophisticated analysis, and interpret\nthe trends in a more realistic and accurate way. This composite approach has en-\nriched the data quality and accuracy of the analysis mainly due to coverage spread\nover 1122 sites, the population based NFHS-3 conducted in 2005-06 covering a sam-\nple size of over 100,000 people for HIV testing, and the targeted surveillance system\nfocusing on high-risk population groups in high burden states with HIV\/AIDS by\nIBBA. Based on the results from these major initiatives and the modified assump-\ntions, the estimates have been revised by adjusting the prevalence figures since 2002.\nThe earlier estimate was 5.2 million with a range of 3.4 million to 9.4 million. As\nper the recent estimates by NACO, there are 2.4 million (with a range of 2 million\nto 3.1 million) people living with HIV\/AIDS at the end of 2006 [45]. Out of these,\n0.97 million (39.3 percent) are women and 0.09 million (3.8 percent) are children.\nThe estimated adult prevalence in the country is 0.36 percent (range: 0.27 - 0.47\npercent). This essentially indicates a declining trend from 0.45 percent in 2002 to\n0.36 percent in 2006. Accordingly, the total number of PLHA has also declined\nfrom 2.73 million in 2002 to 2.47 million in 2006 [45, 44]. There are other reports\nwhich show that fewer people are being infected by HIV and that the HIV burden\nin India is declining [32, 15, 16, 17, 36, 62]. Other studies indicate decline of HIV\nin subgroup populations [35, 22]. The recent estimates also highlight the existence\nof wide-ranging differences in prevalence rates across geographical regions in India.\nThe antenatal clinic sites have shown that HIV prevalence has remained around 1\npercent in previously designated high burden states and a few states such as Tamil\nNadu and Maharashtra have reported declining trends moving to less than 1 percent\nHIV prevalence. The HIV prevalence trends among high-risk groups continues to\nbe high though a marginal decline was noticed among FSWs in select states. IDU\nand MSM groups require greater attention. Disaggregated district level data anal-\nysis also indicates that HIV prevalence is increasing in previously designated low\nburden states. Districts have been categorized based on HIV burden as evidenced\nby sentinel surveillance data either as category A (based on ANC prevalence), B\n(prevalence among high-risk groups), C (migration and other potential features),\nor D (very low prevalence and inadequate data). The estimation procedures and\nprocesses have been validated by a panel of national and international experts rep-\nresenting agencies such as UNAIDS, WHO, and CDC. The panel also interacted\nand consulted with local institutions in fine-tuning the methodologies and refining\nthe assumptions.\n6. Results. Figure 6 depicts the national projections for various levels of interven-\ntion. The five scenarios depicted show the outcome by 2011. The starting point\nof intervention is based on the national estimate of 5.34 million for 2006. It is\nTHE THIRD PHASE INDIAN HIV\/AIDS POLICY: MATHEMATICAL MODELS 795\nimportant to note that the current projections take the present epidemic in India\nas a single epidemic while in reality this is really composed of multiple epidemics\nof different character in different regions\/states of India. Therefore there are some\nlimitations in interpretation of these results.\n6.1. Model validation and sensitivity analysis. We have compared the esti-\nmated values of HIV given by the NACO with our model predictions for the period\n2000-06 (see Table 10 for both of these values in millions). In Figure 6, actual\nestimates obtained by the NACO are shown, connected by dotted lines. Interest-\ningly, model predictions are higher throughout except for 2003, where predictions\nare lower than the estimates, and in 2004 the difference is negligible. There is the\npossibility that, due to relatively few surveillance centers in 2000-01, the preva-\nlence obtained from the national level survey might have under-estimated the total\nnumbers. Remarkably, the number of sentinel surveillance sites increased to a suf-\nficiently high number in the recent past and for 2005 this number is 625 across the\ncountry. We used a Monte Carlo algorithm for model validation and defined an\nobjective function as suggested by Ciupe et al [13]. See Appendix IV for details.\n6.2. NACP II model. If the NACP II level of intervention is continued during\nthe project period of 2006 to 2011, then from the 2004 estimate of 5.134 million the\nprojected number of PLHA is expected to be 5.06 million. Stabilization occurs with\nthe current levels of PLHA on ART (10 percent), thus AIDS related mortality would\ncontinue at the present levels and its implications on health burden, development,\nand poverty will need to be addressed by the country. The projected trends based\non our mathematical modeling are similar to the model using spectrum software\nthat showed that by 2011 there would be 4.73 million PLHA in India [58]. While\nthe differences in the projections based on mathematical and statistical projections\nare minor in terms of overall implications, this must be understood. It is felt that\nthe main reason for the difference is because the mathematical model used the\noverall country average of the sentinel surveillance while the statistical model used\nthe state level estimates and obtained the final projection from summation of the\nstate projections. The majority of sentinel sites are in the southern regions of the\ncountry where the prevalence is higher and this would bias the country projections\nto be over-estimated when national estimates are used for overall projections.\n6.3. Scale-up of ART with NACP II level of interventions. There is a com-\nmitment by the government to provide ART to all those who need it. This translates\nto approximately 10 percent of all HIV patients of whom 80 percent will be identi-\nfied as shown in Table 5. The increased number of PLHA on ART will reduce AIDS\nmortality over the immediate project period and also speed up the development and\npoverty reduction objectives of the country. However if the rapid scale-up of ART\nis associated only with current NACP II levels of prevention and poor integration\nof care and support without focused attention on identified PLHA participating in\npositive preventive living, then the probability of having a worsening situation is\npredicted by the model with the total number of PLHA increasing from 5.13 mil-\nlion to 5.96 million over the next five years. If this scenario develops it is likely to\ncompromise the project objectives of stabilizing and reversing the epidemic.\n6.4. Achieving 50 percent of target of NACP III. NACP aims to expand\ncoverage of high risk group to 80 percent over the project period. The programme\n796 A. S. R. S. RAO, K. THOMAS, K. SUDHAKAR AND P. K. MAINI\nFigure 6.

Three lines are drawn for the cases where the NACP\nIII model assumes, respectively, 50 percent, 75 percent and 100\npercent targets and one line for HIV estimates if NACP II is con-\ntinued. In the initial years of the NACP III period, the impact\nof positive prevention strategies implemented will be moderate but\nby the end of 2009 this impact will be larger. When ART scale-up\nis implemented as discussed in Section 3, we predict the dynamics\nto follow the uppermost line in the figure.\nTHE THIRD PHASE INDIAN HIV\/AIDS POLICY: MATHEMATICAL MODELS 797\nTable 9.

The government is committed to scale-up the ART programme. All those\nwho need ART (10 percent of PLHA) will be accessing treatment through effective\npublic-private partnership. The scale-up ART will be associated with integration\nof care support and treatment. Expansion of voluntary counseling and testing cen-\nters, information education and counseling for generating demand and reduction in\nstigma and discrimination along with facilities for female sex workers, will help to\nidentify the majority of PLHA who will participate in positive living. Transmission\nthrough blood will be reduced to 0.5 percent. Expansion of the Perinatal Mother to\nChild Transmission programme will provide improved ART to 90 percent of the 27\nmillion deliveries in the country. Even with 50 percent of NACP III targets being\nachieved, the total PLHA load will be reduced to 4.4 million from 5.13 million by\n2011.\nFigure 7. NACP III projections for PLHA in MSM.

NACP III projections for PLHA in IDUs. Four sets of\nprojections for HIV estimates among IDUs are shown.\n6.5. Achieving 100 percent of target set by NACP III. If the programme is\nable to achieve 100 percent of the targets set by NACP III, the objective of reversing\nthe epidemic in India will be fulfilled. The total number of PLHA is projected to\nreduce from 5.13 million to 3.8 million by 2011.\n6.6. IDU-related epidemic in India. Our model predicts that the MSM popu-\nlation will continue to grow if NACP II interventions are continued and growth of\nMSM can be controlled in the future through NCAP III interventions (see Fig. 7).\nNeedle exchange and drug substitution is a well-validated strategy for preventing\ntransmission of HIV, Hepatitis B virus, and Hepatitis C virus infections in IDUs.\nWhile the proportion of IDUs is of great significance in some regions of the coun-\ntry, the total number is relatively low in terms of the overall population of India.\nFigure 8 shows the effect of increased coverage of the IDU population with planned\ninterventions. This would result in a projected reduction of infected IDUs from\n24,000 in 2006 to 12,000 by 2011. However the benefit is seen to reduce over time\ndue to the small numbers of the population. The effect can be improved only if\nthe primary problem of IDU itself is addressed. It must be noted that there is a\n800 A. S. R. S. RAO, K. THOMAS, K. SUDHAKAR AND P. K. MAINI\nFigure 9.

We also predict that\n60,000 mother to child HIV infections can be averted during the NACP III period\n(see Fig. 9).\n7. Discussion. Both spectrum analysis based results and results derived from our\nmathematical models show that the HIV\/AIDS epidemic in the country is likely to\nstabilize and reverse over the next five years. By 2012, if the NACP II levels of\nintervention were to continue, the total number of PLHA in the country would vary\nfrom 4.73 million (spectrum analysis) [58] to 5.06 million (mathematical model).\nIt is likely to further reduce to a number between 3.8 million and 4.2 million if\ninterventions in positive prevention and female sex work are initiated under NACP\nIII, successful to 100 percent or 50 percent of the expectations, respectively. One\nof the salient features of NACP III is prevention through behavioral change among\nhigh-risk groups. Increase in condom usage for female sex workers, causal sex, and\nMSM, and changing behavior among IDUs, and controlling transmission through\nblood have been shown to be effective in terms of reducing HIV rates. The 100\npercent target of the NACP III includes, intervention of 80 percent of the high-risk\nTHE THIRD PHASE INDIAN HIV\/AIDS POLICY: MATHEMATICAL MODELS 801\nFigure 10. NACP III projections for number of PLHA (based\non revised estimates). Five sets of projections for HIV estimates\nare shown based on revised estimates by NACO released in 2007.\nOther explanations are as in Figure 6.\ngroup, 50 percent of individuals within the casual sex group, 80 percent of the IDU\ncoverage with needle exchange. Various targets of NACP III can be found in Table\n8. Incidentally, declining HIV trends due to behavioral intervention were observed\nin adults of certain age groups in southern parts of India [30], in some countries\nin Africa [1, 4], and in Thailand. Declining mortality due to ART is also expected\nfrom modeling studies [49]. New reasons and determinants behind ART adherence\nare available [59]. Population projection models by the UN in 2006 have revised\nassumptions on the impact of ART and assumed longer survival time after HIV\ninfection due to ART than in their previous models [66]. We hope our study will\nhelp to initiate further modeling attempts targeting specific sub-populations and\nfurther simulations to study sensitivity and specificity of parameters of interest. In\naddition to the conventional back-calculation methods for predicting the past HIV\ntrend, there are discrete time multistage back-calculation methods available that\nemploy various stages of HIV and AIDS diagnosis. In Appendix III we explain the\nback-calculation methods that we implemented in estimating parameters. Multi-\nstage models, hidden Markov models based on Markov processes, are employed in\n802 A. S. R. S. RAO, K. THOMAS, K. SUDHAKAR AND P. K. MAINI\nestimating transition rates between two or more stages of the disease. Such meth-\nods are more useful for natural history studies in HIV. In the present work, stages\nof the epidemic are not included in projecting the number of people living with\nHIV. For application of the multi-state approach in AIDS see [23] and for general\nideas on multi-stage life-table methodology see [25]. There have been attempts to\ndevelop non-parametric probabilistic methods to study disease progression from one\nstage to another stage when the data are censored [55]. There is a major concern\nand potential threat of rising numbers of PLHA if the ART programme is rapidly\nexpanded without taking into account integration of prevention and care. If this\nhappens even with intervention continuing at NACP II levels, the total number\nof PLHA is likely to increase to 5.96 million by 2011. The present analysis uses\ninformation available on mixing structure in the general as well as high-risk group\npopulations in the country to assist NACP III. NACP III model based predictions\nare also computed using the revised NACO estimates. These revised predictions\nare provided in Figure 10. As more data become available from various studies\nand surveys that are underway and with the launching of new surveys, we expect\nthat future modeling will be more accurate. Programme management implications\nare based on revised estimates. The new estimates underscore the need for sus-\ntained programmatic action since India is among the top three countries in terms\nof HIV burden. The HIV epidemic is concentrated and localized among the high-\nrisk population sub-groups across the country. Initial risk assessments of districts\nindicate that new geographical areas with lower HIV prevalence have started show-\ning increasing trends. Developmental initiatives by the public and private sectors\nhave also resulted in increasing migration of the skilled and unskilled workforce in\nsearch of employment for longer periods away from home. An increase in dispos-\nable income, peer influence towards high-risk behavior, and inadequate health care\ndelivery mechanisms have also contributed to this phenomenon. In this scenario,\nthe national programme is faced with the dual challenge of consolidating the gains\nresulting from the work done so far and scaling up the interventions substantially\nto achieve the goal of halting and reversing the HIV epidemic. The structure and\ncomposition of the Indian population is very diverse. Studies indicate that sexual\nand health protection behaviour of individuals across the states\/regions in India sig-\nnificantly vary [10]. There is a significant variation in the HIV spread and infection\nlevels in the population [43]. For example, heterosexual activity is the major mode\nof transmission for highly populated states in the northern, the central and the\nsouthern regions. Transmission through needle sharing is prevalent in a few north-\neastern states and some other states in India. HIV incidence levels and mixing\npatterns, might be responsible for variations in the prevalence levels among states.\nThere is a need to study HIV spread through mathematical models of dynamics\nof HIV at state-level. Such models are expected to provide a range of estimates\nfor incidence in the population by taking into consideration the state-level targeted\ninterventions in NACP III.\nAnother challenge is that of striking the right balance between prevention and\ntreatment initiatives. Since the epidemic is still concentrated, the interventions\nneed to be target oriented and location specific. The district level planning and\nintervention strategies will greatly help to achieve this objective. Considering the\nsize and magnitude of the country, the resources required to meet the programmatic\ndemands are substantial and call for sustained partnerships at all levels.\nTHE THIRD PHASE INDIAN HIV\/AIDS POLICY: MATHEMATICAL MODELS 803\nIn this context, a more accurate estimate of the HIV burden will help in strate-\ngic evidence-based planning and designing more effective programmes at national,\nstate, and district levels. In addition, this approach will also strengthen the decen-\ntralized target oriented interventions in select locations. Accordingly, the national\nprogramme will have to invest more in public and NGO sector service delivery\nmechanisms and infrastructure; capacity building of public sector, civil society, and\nprivate sector; and a robust strategic information management system. To achieve\nthis complex set of objectives and the overall goal of halting and reversing the epi-\ndemic, the national programme will have to strengthen partnerships with donors,\ncivil society and the private sector.\nAcknowledgments.

All the functions above were used in Models 1, 2, and 3 to\nestimate the number of people living with HIV\/AIDS.\nAppendix II: Parameter values. All the parameter values used in Models 1,\n2, and 3 are given in Tables 3 and 4. Census data for the period 1991-2001, sam-\nple registration system data, various publications, and reports are used to select\nsuitable parameters on the assumption that they explain well the current level of\nHIV epidemiology in India [43, 51, 2, 68, 24, 20, 5]. Studies on the estimation of\ntransmission parameters for HIV and STI were not specifically carried out in India,\nunlike in Japan, Thailand, and several African, American, and European countries\n[48, 31, 46, 9, 60, 26, 29, 47]. However there are very useful studies on natural\nhistory, estimation of high-risk population, prevention impacts available in India\n(for example see [43, 33, 54, 27, 24, 55]). Estimation of key epidemiological param-\neters requires longitudinal cohort studies and cross-sectional studies on incidence\nand prevalence surveys. We make use of published information wherever applicable\nand use the expert reports and opinions where the actual value is not available in\nthe literature.\nNatural growth rate (r): The decadal natural growth rate, r10 is assumed to be\nexponential and is estimated from the equation S2001 = S1991e\nr10.10, where S2001\nand S1991 are susceptible populations aged 15-49 in 2001 and 1991, respectively.\nFrom decadal growth, the annual growth rate is calculated as 0.1*r10. Separate\nTHE THIRD PHASE INDIAN HIV\/AIDS POLICY: MATHEMATICAL MODELS 807\nstudies for the growth rates on MSM and IDUs are not available, so we assumed\nthat the natural growth rates of these sub-populations will follow that of general\nsusceptibles. The values are approximately ri = rm = rIDU = 0.02 per year.\nGeneral mortality rate (\u00b5): Sample registration system-based adult mortality rates\nfor 2006 are used. The sample registration system publishes rates for the population\naged 15-59 by gender with \u00b51 = 0.0041 per year and \u00b52 = 0.0025 per year.\nHIV related mortality (\u03b4): This parameter is estimated as the proportion of deaths\nfrom the HIV infected class from the data provided by Reddy et al [58]. We assume\nthere is no gender based differential in HIV related mortality. It is also assumed\nthat this mortality rate will be the same for MSM and IDUs. The values used in\nthe model are \u03b41 = \u03b42 = \u03b4m = \u03b4IDU = 0.103.\nDisease progression rate (\u03b3): This parameter was estimated for the Indian data\nfrom cohort methods [24] and from other statistical methods using prevalence data\non HIV and AIDS [55]. The UN AIDS reference team suggests that the median\ntime of progression from HIV to AIDS is 9 years. The estimates range from 7 to\n11 years. We choose 8 years as the mean of duration (from the NACP III modeling\nframework) and assume there are no differentials due to gender or behavior. The\nparameter values are \u03b31 = \u03b32 = \u03b3m = \u03b3IDU = 0.125. See Appendix III for further\ntechnical details on disease progression.\nSTI recovery rate (\u03c6). We assume male recovery rate is faster than that for females\nas more males attend STD clinics and their health seeking behavior is relatively\nhigher. We choose \u03c61 = 0.5 per year and \u03c62 = 0.3 per year based on the background\nmodeling report for NACP III [64].\nTransmission rates (\u03bb, \u03b2, \u03b1): We make the following assumptions which are consis-\ntent with published studies. The rates of transmission of HIV and STI for males to\nfemales are higher than for females to males. In addition, the rates of transmission\nof HIV are greater when susceptibles are infected with STI. Transmission rates of\nSTI are lower than that of HIV. We choose \u03bb1j = \u03bbm = \u03bbIDU = 0.003, \u03bb2j = 0.006;\n\u03b21j = \u03b2m = \u03b2IDU = 0.006, \u03b22j = 0.009, and \u03b11j = \u03b1m = \u03b1IDU = 0.012,\n\u03b12j = 0.018 based on the background modeling report for NACP III [5]. All these\nrates are annual rates.\nAppendix III: Disease progression rates. The procedures used for estimating\nthe parameters for incubation period distribution are described in this section. Fur-\nther methodological detail and discussion can be found elsewhere [56, 57, 7, 8]. The\nannual rate of disease progression is considered here as a reciprocal of the average\nincubation period of AIDS (from the time of HIV infection). We use a convolu-\ntion relation between the distribution of reported AIDS cases, HIV density, and\nincubation period distribution [56, 57], and then the rate of disease progression was\nestimated by de-convoluting this relation.\nSuppose X and Z are distribution functions of cumulative AIDS cases and incu-\nbation period distribution, respectively, and w is the HIV density function then, by\n[7, 8], we have\nX(t) =\n\u222b tn\n0\nw(s)Z(t\u2212 s)ds (4)\n808 A. S. R. S. RAO, K. THOMAS, K. SUDHAKAR AND P. K. MAINI\nwhere tn is the last available time point (year) of AIDS cases. The above convolution\nis fundamental in the back-calculation method. In equation (4), w was assumed to\nbe a quadratic exponential function parameterized by a0, a1, and a2 as shown below\n(see [52] for details in considering such a function for Indian data):\nw(t) = exp(a0 + a1t+ a2t\n2). (5)\nHIV prevalence in sub-populations during the recent past has been declining\nwith a peak, so equation (5) is justified. a0, a1, and a2 are estimated from the\nsero-prevalence data. The most widely accepted functional form for the incubation\nperiod is the Weibull distribution [56, 57], although there are other functions, for\nexample, the gamma, and logistic distributions were also demonstrated to be ap-\npropriate [57]. The functional form for Z is assumed to follow the Weibull function\nwith parameters b0 and b1 as shown below:\nZ(b0, b1; t) = 1\u2212 exp\n{\n\u2212\n(\nt\nb0\n)b1}\n. (6)\nAssuming that the reported AIDS cases will follow a multinomial distribution\n[26], the likelihood equation is L =\n\u220fn\ni=1 p\nXi\ni , where pi is the conditional probability\ngiven by\npi =\nX(ti)\u2212X(ti\u22121)\nX(tn)\n. (7)\nEquations (4) and (5) are used to de-convolute Z and estimate parameters in\n(6) by the maximum likelihood estimation on L. X(t\u2217) =\n\u222b t\u2217\n0 w(s)Z(t\u2217 \u2212 s)ds in\nequation (7). X1, X2, ..., Xn are reported AIDS cases from the beginning to the\nlatest available calender years. We applied a bootstrap method [19] to calculate 95\npercent confidence interval for the estimated parameters.\nThe incubation periods are estimated for the sub-population disease progression\nrates by considering reported AIDS cases among the individuals with or without\nSTDs, IDUs, and MSM. Suppose X(ti, 1), X(ti, 2), X(ti, 3), and X(ti, 4) represent\nthe distribution functions of cumulative AIDS and Z1(t), Z2(t), Z3(t) and Z4(t) are\nincubation period distribution for four sub-populations, namely, individuals with\nSTDs, individuals without STDs, IDUs, and MSM, respectively. Then the four\nconditional probabilities are computed as follows:\npji =\nX(ti, j)\u2212X(ti\u22121, j)\nX(tn, j)\n, (j = 1, 2, 3, 4).\nThe parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood functions,\nLj =\nn\u220f\ni=1\np\nXi(j)\nji , (j = 1, 2, 3, 4).\nSubstituting the value of pji and expanding the product of terms in Lj will lead\nto,\nTHE THIRD PHASE INDIAN HIV\/AIDS POLICY: MATHEMATICAL MODELS 809\nLj =\nn\u220f\ni=1\n{X(ti, j)\u2212X(ti\u22121, j)}\nXi(j) {X(tn, j)}\n\u2212Xi(j)\n= {X(t1, j)\u2212X(t0, j)}\nX1(j) {X(tn, j)}\n\u2212X1(j) \u00d7\n{X(t2, j)\u2212X(t1, j)}\nX2(j) {X(tn, j)}\n\u2212X2(j) \u00d7 ...\n\u00d7{X(tn, j)\u2212X(tn\u22121, j)}\nXn(j) {X(tn, j)}\n\u2212Xn(j)\n=\n{\n1\u2212\nX(t0, j)\nX(t1, j)\n}\nX1(j) {X(t1, j)}\nX1(j) {X(tn, j)}\n\u2212X1(j) \u00d7\n{\n1\u2212\nX(t1, j)\nX(t2, j)\n}\nX2(j) {X(t2, j)}\nX2(j) {X(tn, j)}\n\u2212X2(j) \u00d7 ...\n\u00d7\n{\n1\u2212\nX(t1, j)\nX(t2, j)\n}\nXn(j) {X(tn, j)}\nXn(j) {X(tn, j)}\n\u2212Xn(j).\nAppendix IV: Model predictions and sensitivity analysis. We adopt the\nMonte Carlo procedure of Ciupe et al [13] for model validation and sensitivity\nanalysis. Consider three vectors of parameters, A1, A2, and A3. Let I1(A1, ti),\nI2(A2, ti), and I3(A3, ti) be the predicted individual levels from the model and\nI1(ti), I2(ti), and I3(ti) be, respectively, the corresponding observed values for\ninfecteds in the general population, MSM population, and IDU population at time\nti. We define three objective functions (as in [13]) as follows:\nJ1(A1) =\n{\nn\u2211\ni=1\nI1 (A1, ti)\u2212 log (I1 (ti))\n} 1\n2\nJ2(A2) =\n{\nn\u2211\ni=1\nI2 (A2, ti)\u2212 log (I2 (ti))\n} 1\n2\nJ3(A3) =\n{\nn\u2211\ni=1\nI3 (A3, ti)\u2212 log (I3 (ti))\n} 1\n2\n.\nThe three vectors in the above equations are represented as follows:\nA1 = [ri, \u03bbij , \u03b2ij , \u03c6, \u03b1ij , \u00b5, \u03b4i]\nT\nA2 = [rm, \u03bbm, \u03b2m, \u03c6, \u03b1m, \u00b5, \u03b4m]\nT\nA3 = [rIDU , \u03bbIDU , \u03b2IDU , \u03c6, \u03b1IDU , \u00b5, \u03b4IDU ]\nT\n.\nWe then follow the method in Ciupe et al [13] for further analysis. For the sensi-\ntivity analysis, our focus is to study the impact of two parameters namely, disease\n810 A. S. R. S. RAO, K. THOMAS, K. SUDHAKAR AND P. K.

Schematic diagrams representing the various age-\ndependent transmission rates.\nprogression and transmission rate of HIV with STI. In addition to this, we alter nu-\nmerical values of these parameters and obtain model predictions. By removing the\ndisease progression parameters from Model 1, individuals with full-blown disease\ndisappear from the infected population and by removing the parameter responsible\nfor transmission rate of HIV with STI, the resultant number of HIV and AIDS\nindividuals from 2007 to 2011 declined from 2.2 to 1.3 million. By simultaneously\nremoving both the above parameters from the model, the epidemic looks very much\nunder control (i.e., growth of infections is controlled). We have tested the sensitiv-\nity of the model predictions to the above two parameters by varying them by 10\npercent to 80 percent of their original values. The results are shown in Table 11.\nAppendix V: Virus spread models with age-structure. Here we construct\nage-structured models for the spread of HIV. These are extensions of the models\nexplained in section 3, where homogeneous mixing is considered. In practice, our\nstudy does not attempt to project age-specific projections of PLHA. Suppose \u03bb\n(k)\nij ,\n\u03b2\n(k)\nij , and \u03b1\n(k)\nij are, respectively, the transmission rate of sexually transmitted in-\nfections, the transmission rate of human immunodeficiency virus (without STI in\nthe host), and the transmission rate of human immunodeficiency virus (with STI in\nthe host) from a gender j of any age group to the gender i of age group (k). Here,\nby age-dependent transmission rate we mean the transmission rate from infected to\nsusceptible (host) by considering the age of the host. Hence within each host age\ngroup the transmission rates are the same and are independent of the age group of\nthe infecteds (see schematic description in Fig. 11).\nIf the parameters and variables described in section 3 are extended for the age-\ndependent notation, then the three models describing the HIV transmission for\nvarious age groups will be as follows:\nTHE THIRD PHASE INDIAN HIV\/AIDS POLICY: MATHEMATICAL MODELS 811\nModel A1.

Spread among homosexual men and injection drug users is ex-\nplained separately in Models A2 and A3 with corresponding sets of variables S\n(k)\nm ,\nG\n(k)\nm , I\n(k)\nm and D\n(k)\nm and S\n(k)\nIDU , I\n(k)\nIDU and D\n(k)\nIDU respectively. Other parameters used\nin the age-structured models in this section are defined similarly to those in section\n3, except that they are now for a specific age group (k). It is not easy to obtain\nmany of the parameters for each age group even though there is evidence for age de-\npendency in the infection process. The rate of disease progression is age dependent\nand there is an advantage in using age-specific rates in predicting the disease, as\nindividuals with higher age at the time of infection tend to progress to full disease\nquicker than those who are infected at a younger age [18, 11]. Detailed studies\nare needed to estimate such age-related issues for disease progression, transmission\nrates, and death rates in India in the era of anti-retroviral therapies. A stochastic\nage-dependent model that predicts the number of PLHA by using the above infor-\nmation could be an alternative when the size of the population under anti-retroviral\ntherapy is small.\nModel A2.

See Appendix III for the basic introduc-\ntion to the notation.\nSuppose Zl, wl are probability distribution functions of incubation period and\nHIV infection density, respectively, for individuals who were infected at age l. We\nassume the incubation period for all the individuals at age l is a variable. Zl and wl\nare computed by estimating the parameters a1\nl, a2\nl, a2\nl, b0\nl, and b1\nl as explained\nin Appendix III. If Xi\nl denotes the reported AIDS cases at time i and infecteds at\nage l, then the conditional probabilities would become,\npi\nl =\n{\nX(ti)\nl\n\u2212X(ti\u22121)\nl\n}{\nX(tn)\nl\n}\u22121\nwhere \u03c9 is the maximum age of the individual at the time of HIV infection and who\nlater developed AIDS.
