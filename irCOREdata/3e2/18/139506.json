Screw thread roots, shaft fillets and many other machine details are\nroutinely cold rolled for this reason, and improvements in resistance to fatigue crack\ninitiation by a factor of up to five fold are not uncommon [1 -3]. Features of residual\nstresses in metals are that they are often transient in nature and can relax under cyclic\nloading and at high temperature. The magnitude of residual stress a material can\n3contain is related to its yield strength, thus high strength materials can contain higher\nresidual stresses and, in theory, can therefore benefit more from cold working treatment.\nA previous paper [4] introduced the idea of controlling fatigue crack propagation\nthrough \u201cstitch cold rolling\u201d. The study was at the time in its infancy. This present\npaper reports further tests including one on a cracked specimen approaching 1 x 107\ncycles, still exhibiting a slow linear crack growth rate. It also presents an analytical\nfracture mechanics approach that sets the basis for prediction of fatigue crack growth in\nanisotropic materials such as a surface cold worked component.\nANALYTICAL FRACTURE MECHANICS STUDY\nFirstly, to briefly describe the context for the work, it should be appreciated that\ncrack shape can be just as influential on crack propagation as applied load magnitude\n[5]. To illustrate this, Figure 1 below shows the well known Newman Raju flat plate\nsurface crack Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) solution [6] around a crack front under\ntension, plotting Normalised SIF (or Y Factor) against crack angle (0 \u2192 \u03c0) for a range \nof crack shapes (crack aspect ratio).\n40.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nPHI\nK\nno\nrm\na\/c = 0.2\na\/c = 0.4\na\/c = 0.6\na\/c = 0.8\na\/c = 1.0\nFigure 1. Newman Raju SIF Solutions [6] for different Shaped Cracks\nAt the crack deepest point (\u03c6\/2) a very long crack with an aspect ratio of a\/c =\n0.2 has a high SIF compared with the value at the surface point. This crack therefore\ntends to grow faster at the deepest point meaning the crack aspect ratio becomes higher\nas the crack grows. A shorter crack of the same depth, say a\/c = 0.6 has a far lower SIF\nat its deepest point, but still this is higher than the SIF at the surface. Taking the other\nextreme, a semi-circular crack (a\/c = 1.0) has a higher SIF at the surface than at its\n5\uf044a \uf044a\n\uf044c\uf044c\na aa\nc c c\n\uf044Sc \uf044Sa\uf044S\ndeepest point meaning it extends faster at the surface under cyclic fatigue loading\nresulting in a semi-ellipse with a lower aspect ratio. These observations are important\nfor the predication of crack propagation behaviour but also suggest that if a crack shape\ncan be prescribed or crack growth restricted in one direction, then the crack growth rate\ncan be controlled.\nA powerful method for describing the SIF around a crack front is the RMS SIF\n[7] approach. This considers crack growth in two principal directions: 1) in crack\nlength (c-direction), and 2) in crack depth (a-direction). The RMS or average value for\nSIF, Krms, enclosed by the area, S, can be derived from Krmsc in the c-direction and Krmsa\nin the a-direction (See Figure 2).\n\uf0f2\n\uf044\n\uf044\n\uf03d\ncS\nc\nc\ncrms dSKS\nK )(1 22 \uf066 \uf0f2\uf044\uf044\n\uf03d\nSrms\ndSK\nS\nK )(1 22 \uf066 \uf0f2\n\uf044\n\uf044\n\uf03d\naS\na\na\narms dSKS\nK )(1 22 \uf066\nRMS SIF Longitudinal (c) RMS SIF average RMS SIF Transverse (a)\nFigure 2.

Many researchers have observed the behaviour\nillustrated by Figures 4 and 5 that irrespective of the initial or starting crack shape, the\ncrack tends to an optimum aspect ratio for different types of structural components [8,\n9]. This is independent of applied stress range assuming a single crack but can be\naffected by material anisotropy and certainly by loading mode (e.g. tension, bending,\nshear, etc.,).\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\na\/T\na\/\nc starting\na\/c=0.556\nstarting\na\/c=0.625\nstarting\na\/c=0.714\nstarting\na\/c=0.833\nstarting\na\/c=1\nFigure 4.

The plates were 790mm in length and 200mm in width;\nspecimens 1 & 2 had a thickness of 40mm, specimens 3, 4 & 5 were 20mm thick.\nStitch rolling, where the central area of the plate was left unrolled, was performed using\na purpose built cold rolling rig applying a force of 21kN to the roller placed in a\nmachined notch on the plate surface and forced along the notch by a hydraulic jack.\nSeveral rolling passes were applied, monitoring the applied load carefully during the\nrolling process. Table 1 details these and summarises the test parameters.\n10\nTable 1.

Tests 1, 3\nand 4 had an unrolled length of 20mm, whereas tests 2 and 4 had a longer 40mm\nunprotected length. Table 2 summarises the fatigue test parameters and duration.\n11\nTable 2.

Fracture Surfaces.\n15\nDISCUSSION\nThe crack growth data in Figure 7 are clearly unusual not only due to the very slow\ncrack propagation rates, but also several tests clearly show a retardation effect. All tests\nshow normal fatigue crack growth until the crack extends out of the unrolled length to\nmeet with the cold rolled region. Tests 2 & 5 had the longest unrolled length (40mm)\nand the results clearly show deeper cracks despite these having two different values of\nplate thickness. Neither test showed a clear resumption of growth following arrest but\nagain it should be noted the tests were terminated prematurely. Test 3 showed similar\nbehaviour, Tests 1 and 4 clearly show recovery following retardation. These tests\ndiffered in the plate thickenesses but also that Test 1 was rerolled after crack initiation.\nTest 4 shows the extrodinary propagation life of greater than 8 x 106 cycles, a\ncomparative unrolled propagation life would be in the order of 1.5 x 106 cycles using a\nNewman Raju based prediction.\n16\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.0 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.5\na\/T\na\/\nc\nTest 1\nTest 2\nTest 3\nTest 4\nTest 5\nFigure 9. Crack Shape Evolution Data for all Tests.\nFigure 9 shows the crack aspect ratio data. If this is compared with Figure 5, it\nis appreciated that the crack shapes have in all cases been altered significantly from\ntheir optimum aspect ratio. Under bending these cracks have higher stress at the surface\npoint as they grow towards the neutral axis. It appears clear for the relatively thin plates\ntested that under pure bending, it is unlikely that a crack could be encouraged to grow to\nthrough thickness. This would not be the case under axial tension, and at this point, it is\n17\nhypothesised that axial tension should produce a leak-before\u2013break crack. The\nretardation and, in some cases, the crack arrest effect however is remarkable.\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nThe following comclusions can be drawn:\n\uf0b7 An RMS SIF approach can be used to predict crack growth evolution. In this\npaper, has not been compared with the experimental results, as the solution does\nnot currently model the cold rolling residual stress effects.\n\uf0b7 Controlled surface cold working can significantly retard fatigue crack\npropagation.\n\uf0b7 The effects of cold working were observed for several million cycles at a\nnominal cyclic stress close to half yield stress.\n\uf0b7 Cracks loaded under bending extended only very slowly in depth when the\nlength was contained by cold working meaning that through thickness cracks are\nunlikely.\nCurrent work at Cranfield University involves axial tests on shot peened and laser\npeened specimens. In addition, residual stress measurements are being made and in\n18\nparallel the analytical fracture mechanics model is under development to use SIF weight\nfunctions [11] to incorporate residual stress effects. It is anticipated that experience\nwith fatigue testing and development of analytical tools will allow the use of\nstitch\/preferential cold working in structural components to extend life and develop the\nconcept of controlled failure design.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of NDE Technology Limited\nin funding this work, Lt J Boyle (RN) for carrying out Test 3, and Ms S Ng for Tests 4\n& 5.\nREFERENCES\n1.
