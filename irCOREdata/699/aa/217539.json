Eight of the children died. Subsequently, in a matter of weeks, five more school killings followed in \ndifferent parts of China.1 Between 23 March and 12 May 2010, numerous children were killed and injured.  \nAll six killings were carried out by middle-aged men using knives, hammers or cleavers. There had been isolated cases of spree killings in \nChina before, where children had been the main victims.2 But never before had school killings on this scale occurred in China within such a \nshort period of time. The attacks took place in different provinces several thousand kilometres apart. It is highly probable that the first attack, \nwhich was widely publicized, triggered the subsequent attacks. Hardly any news event in recent years has caused such a stir among the Chinese \npublic, with reactions ranging from horror at the cruelty of the attacks to diffuse anxieties about a moral crisis in Chinese society. The \ngovernment soon clamped down on news coverage, citing fears of further copycat killings. Yet both inside and outside China, debates continue \nabout the motivations and underlying reasons. \nMass murders of a similar nature occur in many other societies. School killings take place in Europe and North America, and these are \ntypically blamed on individualization, the effects of a mass media and what some identify as social breakdown (e.g. see Newman et al. 2004). \nThe phenomenon of \u2018running amok\u2019 in Malay-speaking areas has been explained as a \u2018culture-bound syndrome\u2019 (e.g. Saint Martin 1999). While \nit is difficult to explain the Chinese school killings in terms of some pattern or other to be found in an unchanging \u2018Chinese culture\u2019, it may be \npossible to connect the killings to processes of social change, as in the case of similar incidents in the West. There are, however, differences \nbetween these killings and their Western counterparts, most notably weapons3 used and the age of the perpetrators, with the Chinese attackers \nbeing older than, for example, North American school killers. \nThe school killings throw a number of social and political problems in contemporary China into sharp relief. Journalists, blog commentators \nand scholars writing on these incidents relate the killings to rapid social change, insecurity, unemployment and inequality. Many see the killings \nas a sign of a moral crisis engulfing China (e.g. Fan, Yang & Zhou 2010; Moody 2010). Government rhetoric of the \u2018harmonious society\u2019 was \ndealt a blow by the murders, which many saw as a symptom of widespread social anomie.  \nThis article will explore the media responses to the killings, which tended to involve much speculation about the wider social backdrop of the \nevents and theorizing about what they implied about Chinese society. It will also examine the individual cases of three of the murderers, each of \nwhich appears to involve elements of revenge-taking against \u2018society\u2019. \nWe connect the search for underlying reasons and caused of the murders with the wider search for \u2018society\u2019 in contemporary China. We \nconclude by emphasizing the gap between the official promotion of the idea of \u2018society\u2019 as a cohesive moral community and a parallel popular \nunderstanding of the contemporary Chinese social world as a \u2018savage wilderness\u2019. \nMedia reactions \nInitially, the media response was one of simple horror at the crimes and revulsion for their perpetrators. Just after the first murderer was \nexecuted, Southern Weekend, a popular weekly newspaper, printed the headline \u2018Now that he is executed, we are all relieved\u2019 (Chai 2010). The \nnewspaper expressed the rage and fear of many, but was itself vehemently attacked soon after, for ignoring the broader social context of the \nattacks. Meanwhile, more school killings followed in quick succession.  \nOn the day of Zhang Minsheng\u2019s execution, the third in the series occurred. By then many people had started to look for explanations beyond \nthe personal histories of the individual perpetrators. Popular debate ensued, in particular on the internet, where journalists and bloggers wrote \ncommentaries and discussed the incidents. Huang Hung, the China Daily columnist, for instance, wrote in her English blog that she was relieved \nwhen \u2018Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said in an interview with Phoenix TV in Hong Kong that the child murders reflect deep social problems in \nChina. Thank goodness the prime minister actually recognizes that fact \u2013 and didn\u2019t blame the killings on freedom of the press.\u2019 (Huang 2010). \nThe comments of the highly regarded blogger Han Han straightforwardly identified official corruption as the underlying reason for the human \ncalamities that led to the school killings. In a scathing post, he wrote on his blog \u2018you children, you died for the corruption and debauchery of \nyour grandfathers [the old guards of the party and state]\u2019 (Han 2010). The perpetrators of the attacks were disillusioned and desperate men, Han \nnotes, and continues: \u2018If they feel there\u2019s no way out in society, then killing those even weaker than themselves becomes their only way out. I \nrecommend that all the police guarding local officials nationwide be transferred to guard kindergartens. A government that can\u2019t even protect \nchildren doesn\u2019t need so many people protecting it\u2019.  \nThe claim that the government failed to protect the children is poignant for Chinese readers, given the continuous attempts by the party and \ngovernment to present itself as a benevolent parental authority. But while officials claim to exert their power with parental compassion and good \nintentions, many see them as self-interested people who help themselves to public funds. The suggestion that official corruption was the root cause \nof China\u2019s moral crisis \u2013 of which the school killings were the most atrocious expression \u2013 surfaced in many of the ensuing debates. \nAfter the last in this series of school killings, the parents of a child at a kindergarten in Guangdong Province hung a banner on the fence of the \nschool, on which they wrote \u2018Who are the real culprits? The government building is right next to the kindergarten!\u2019 A photo of this banner was \nwidely circulated on the internet, and netizens soon picked up on it, and appended a satirical narrative to it: \nthe government made its own banner, on which was written \u2018Don\u2019t bother us, we have to attend meetings: the army is not far away\u2019. The army in turn, declared \nthat \u2018Smart people will understand facts: the tax-office is right over there\u2019. The tax-office officials then wrote their banner: \u2018This is not our business: it was the \ncity administrators who destroyed the foundations of people\u2019s livelihoods\u2019. The city administrations blamed the police, the police blamed the People\u2019s \nConsultative Conference, the consultative conference blamed the real-estate sharks, and finally the real-estate sharks blamed the government again, and wished \npeople a peaceful sleep. But people cannot sleep under these circumstances, which is really the kindergarten\u2019s fault.4 \nThis satirical narrative drawn from the internet illustrates in a disconcerting way the search for the reasons behind social injustice in \ncontemporary China. People want to hold government offices and institutions responsible, but each organization finds excuses and blames \nanother. In the end, people are left with profound disquiet: horrible things are taking place and no one accepts responsibility for what is \nhappening. \nThe story ridicules the concept of the \u2018harmonious society\u2019 by questioning the good intentions of the leadership, the party and the government: \nin reality, there are only atomized individuals and institutions. The idea that state and government should be held accountable for social \nproblems makes sense against the background of these propaganda concepts, in which state and society are united as one family. Several of the \nsix murderers also directly held the state and\/or \u2018society\u2019 responsible for their personal misfortunes. Before we try to disentangle the links \nbetween society and state, we will examine three of the six cases in more detail. \nThree cases: Revenge against society and state \nZheng Minsheng, the first killer, has attracted the most attention of the six men.5 He was a doctor at a hospital affiliated to a local factory. His \nsuccess at the operating table and his widely acknowledged skills as a physician earned him the nickname of \u2018Master Surgeon Zheng\u2019 (Zheng Yi \nDao). After the killing, many local people were astonished by the fact that \u2018Master Surgeon Zheng\u2019 had become such a cruel killer. People who \nknew him could not believe what had happened to him. His neighbours said that he was not hostile to children. In the months before the killings, \nthey had often seen him playing with children. \nAs a local doctor, Zheng enjoyed a good reputation among the factory\u2019s patients, workers and other doctors. Both his brother and sister were \nworkers at the factory. Their salaries as factory employees were relatively small, and the family lived in modest conditions. Apparently, Zheng had \ndifficulties dealing with some colleagues, but these problems did not appear serious. \nIn 2002, the hospital became a community clinic separate from the factory. Zheng\u2019s relationship with his colleagues worsened, and he \nfrequently complained that the head physician did not respect him. In 2008, Zheng was promoted and he complained more frequently about his \nsuperior. In 2009 he quit. Immediately after resigning, Zheng visited several hospitals in search of employment. At the beginning of 2010, he \ngave up hope of finding another job and became depressed. \nZheng testified in court that, aside from his failure to find a job, another reason for his depression was his failure to get married. Friends had \ntried to introduce young women to him, but every time a woman realized that his family was relatively poor, she would break up with him. In \n2008, Zheng had finally found a girlfriend. The relationship lasted about a year. When Zheng left his job, the woman\u2019s elder brother persuaded \nher to leave him. Zheng complained to his neighbours that she had decided not to marry him because of his poverty. It seems likely that Zheng \nwould have been under severe pressure to find a job and get married. According to neighbours, he had frequent arguments with his mother and \nbrother about this. \nUnlike the other five killers, Xu Yuyuan was from a relatively wealthy family. He had a large house worth more than a million yuan, and \nadditional income from renting out another property he owned. His only daughter was due to wed the following October. It seemed that he was \nin a comfortable financial situation and he had good relationships with his children, who were doing well. But many people disliked his bad \ntemper, and he enjoyed gambling. He had been accused of sexual harassment and domestic violence, and his relationship with his wife was not \ngood. In 2001, Xu was accused of fraud and was sacked from his job at an insurance company. He became involved in several illegal businesses. \nAlthough his wife was running two shops, he was not satisfied with their financial situation. He wanted to earn more money but failed in the \nvarious enterprises he started, and accumulated substantial debts. A week before the killing, one of his creditors slapped him during an argument. \nThis incident reportedly sent Xu into a depression. \nWang Yonglai, who committed suicide after his attack on five schoolchildren, was a farmer who had been involved in a village dispute. The \ndispute was over a plot of land in Wang\u2019s village that he had been forbidden to build on, until one day the village committee declared that \nvillagers could build there if they paid a certain sum of money. Wang Yonglai and some other villagers had paid the requested sum and begun \nbuilding. Wang\u2019s son was to get married in the house he had built on the plot. But when the houses were almost finished, officials from a higher \ngovernment office found out that the village committee had issued building permits without the necessary authorization, and after a short \ninvestigation all the new houses were demolished. Wang Yonglai lost all the money he had spent on the building permit and the building itself, \nand he tried in vain to get compensation from the local government. \nThe six killers were from different backgrounds, with different experiences and possible motives for their crimes, but what they all had in \ncommon was failure and severe frustration. Of course, economic competition, social pressures and the unjust acts of officialdom cannot \n\u2018explain\u2019 the murder of innocent children, nevertheless, these were identified as the causes by both many commentators on the killings and the \nkillers themselves. \nZheng Minsheng openly claimed that he had killed the children in order to \u2018take revenge against society\u2019 (baofu shehui) and that he himself \nwas only partially responsible. He went on to claim that his victims, and he himself, stood together against society. \u2018If the real reason is not \ndisclosed, neither the eight children nor I will close our eyes in the underworld\u2019, he stated in court, implying that he was as innocent as the \nchildren (Yang, L. 2010). \nThough not so dramatically expressed, \u2018revenge against society\u2019 was also the most frequently cited motive in each of the other cases. What do \npeople mean when they say they want to take revenge against society in today\u2019s China? To broaden out the question a little, how are family, \nsociety and state constituted and inter-related in contemporary China? \nWhat \u2018society\u2019 means in contemporary China \nIn our previous work, we have studied everyday ethics in family life in contemporary China (Steinm\u00fcller 2009; Wu 2009). Like other \nanthropologists who have written on this topic over the last few decades (Liu 2000; Yan 2003; Ku 2004), we have attempted to situate moral life in \ncontemporary China within the context of family, society and state. \nIn his studies of suicide in contemporary Chinese society, Wu Fei suggests that, rather than pursuing a meaningful life in the context of an \nabstract \u2018society\u2019, ordinary Chinese people seek fulfilment from securing their place in the power arrangements within the family (Wu 2005, \n2009). Ever since modernizing elites started disseminating emancipative ideas of individual freedom, equality and dignity, ideals of \nindividualism and independence have complicated the struggles to achieve power balance within families. While these discourses offered new \npossibilities for self-realization, they also brought new problems and intensified domestic struggles (cf. Wu 2009: 195 ff.).  \nA crucial question is how public discourse and domestic practice diverge over concepts of \u2018society\u2019 and \u2018state\u2019 in contemporary China. The \nidea that China lacks a sphere of social association in between the family and the state has a long-standing history among Chinese intellectuals. \nThe neo-Confucian philosopher Liang Shuming described the Chinese world view as comprising the family and the cosmos \u2013 that is, tianxia \n(\u2018all under heaven\u2019). According to Liang, China lacks notions of the individual, and of society as an abstract, supra-individual association, as \ndeveloped in the West (Liang 1987a, 1987b). This concept of \u2018society\u2019 itself was introduced into Chinese in the 19th century as a Japanese loan \nword, which in turn was a translation from European languages (cf. Liu 1995).  \nLike many intellectuals in early-20th-century China, Liang believed one of the main tasks of the modern state was to create and organize this \nabstraction, \u2018society\u2019. Sun Yat-sen, the first president of the Chinese Republic, famously remarked that \u2018the Chinese people are like sand\u2019, and \nhence need to be organized. This organization of society by the state was the historical task of the communist revolution: during the Maoist era, a \nunified and centralized state apparatus and a plethora of social organizations were set up, all of which were entangled with the hierarchy of party \nand state. The promotion of socialism,6 the consolidation of party rule, and the politics of mass mobilization led to a systematic blurring of \n\u2018society\u2019 and \u2018state\u2019. \nA further result of the processes of state formation throughout the 20th century in mainland China has been the consolidation and \ndissemination of an official modernist discourse linked to state and nation. In this discourse, \u2018society\u2019 plays a decisive role as the object of \nmodernizing efforts and the subject of a new political and moral community. \nThe notion of \u2018society\u2019 is, however, interpreted very differently in official and popular discourses. When party officials and intellectuals use \nthe word \u2018society\u2019, they imply solidarity and cohesion. The promotion of the idea of \u2018society\u2019 as a moral community is intended to inspire a \nsense of stability and legitimize government policies. In popular discourse, however, \u2018society\u2019 is often a jungle \u2013 a space of coldness and \nindifference. Parents frequently scold their children in order to prepare them to \u2018enter society\u2019 (zou shang shehui). \u2018Enter society\u2019 here means to \nleave the warm space of the family, where people take care of each other, where you can live freely and don\u2019t have to worry, for a social space \nconstituted of strangers, where there is much danger and risk. Young people are taught to learn a new set of skills and techniques in order to \nsurvive in this wilderness. After the school killings, this notion of society as a \u2018wilderness\u2019 was frequently invoked. \nZheng Minsheng\u2019s statement in court suggested that \u2018society\u2019 was responsible for what he had done: it was because of an unjust society that \nhe could not get a new job, could not find a wife, and lived a life of poverty. He was an innocent victim of society, used as an instrument by \nsociety to hurt innocent children. In other words, \u2018society\u2019 was the first and final cause of his misery and the misery he inflicted on others. \nIn Wang Yonglai\u2019s case, it seemed that corruption in local government was directly responsible for his misfortune. In that case, one might ask why \nhe chose to attack innocent school pupils and not local government officials. But though horrifying and apparently irrational, Wang\u2019s displaced act \nof \u2018revenge\u2019 did have an effect: after he killed the children and himself, the local government stopped demolishing houses in his village. \nTargeting innocent children, the attackers destroyed the \u2018only hope\u2019 of these children\u2019s families and their country (cf. Fong 2006). Most of \nthose killed in the attacks were only children. As members of the one-child generation, they were loaded with expectations from their families \nand from the Chinese nation. The family-planning policies of recent decades was combined with the promotion of \u2018population quality\u2019 (renkou \nsuzhi), and the \u2018only child\u2019 became the main object of these policies and discourses, and therefore a powerful symbol of the connection between \nfamily, society and nation.7 \nThis is how these children could have become the targets of these killings. Stories such as Wang Yonglai\u2019s, and a belief in a generalized \nculture of corruption in much Chinese officialdom, as illustrated in the internet discourses about official buck-passing in response to the killings, \nmeant that many pointed the finger at the state after the school murders. The urge to blame the state is in part an ironic product of the state\u2019s own \npromotion of an ideal of ideological harmony and unity of state and society. Bringing together Confucian and Maoist notions of government, \npropaganda reproduces symbolic equivalences between family and country, between father and ruler, in an idea of \u2018kindly power\u2019 that projects \nthe compassion and invariably good intentions of the government.  \nAs Yang Jie (2010: 551) points out, the state\u2019s projection of such \u2018kindly power\u2019 serves to legitimate destruction and violence while at the \nsame time the state employs humanitarian measures \u2018to counteract or mask the effects of that destruction\u2019.8 These contradictions are \nintermittently experienced by Chinese citizens as extremely disillusioning, and many observers assumed that Wang Yonglai and the other school \nkillers were motivated at least in part by such frustrations. \nConclusion \nWe do not argue that contemporary Chinese society is a \u2018wilderness\u2019, nor that the Chinese government bears the responsibility for these murders. \nBut both ideas were prominent among the responses to the killings. For many Chinese, it seems, society is either a hostile wilderness, or else \nsomething that has been overwhelmed by the power of the party-state: in either case, a positive or neutral notion of \u2018society\u2019 seems impossible. \nThe school killings have crystallized in public discourse a generalized sense of social and political alienation, and \u2018society\u2019 has come to \nsymbolize this alienation. \nSince the 1980s, China has seen rapid economic growth, which has raised living standards under conditions of relative political stability. For \nthe majority of Chinese people, the \u2018problem of having enough food and clothing\u2019 (wenbao wenti) has been resolved, and \u2018social stability\u2019 \n(shehui wending) has been guaranteed. These achievements are frequently emphasized in official discourse.  \nThe shift of focus in public discourse from political to economic matters, however, has also implied greater distance between high politics and \neveryday moral concerns. The sense of injustice and inequality has multiplied considerably, yet at the same time society as a moral community \u2013 \nas in \u2018social-ism\u2019 (shehui zhuyi) and \u2018harmonious society\u2019 (hexie shehui) \u2013 is continually extolled in public discourse. \nThe government\u2019s projection of \u2018society\u2019 as a big family, and of itself as that family\u2019s benevolent patriarchal authority, gives rise to disappointed \nexpectations and contradictions in everyday life, in which many people experience \u2018society\u2019 as an indifferent, even savage, place. Perhaps what \nis needed is a new understanding of \u2018society\u2019, a new intermediate mode of sociality that occupies a space, between state and family, where \npeople can come together against the wilderness that many seem to be experiencing in contemporary China. \uf06c \n \n1. Another knife attack took place in a kindergarten in Zibo, Shandong Province, on 3 August 2010, in which more than 20 children were injured and at least four killed by a 26-year-\nold \u2018self-employed\u2019 man. See Song (2010) for a summary of Western and Chinese reports on the Zibo attack. \n2. Similar attacks against schoolchildren took place in 2003 (Pinyu, Henan Province), 2004 (Ruzhou, Henan Province) and 2006 (Jiamusi, Heilongjiang Province). The Ruzhou incident of \n2004 was also seen as part of a series of copycat killings, which were, however, not in such quick succession as the 2010 cases, and in which fewer children were murdered (Forney 2004).  \n3. The main reason why knives, hammers and cleavers were used in these killings is because such weapons are readily available, whereas guns are not available to most Chinese people. \n4. This story was widely circulated on the internet. See for instance: http:\/\/zhidao.baidu.com\/question\/151694327 (accessed 22 Jul. 2010). \n5. In the following, we rely mainly on information from Chinese newspapers and websites. The first case was widely publicized, including the details of the trial and the execution. In the \nremaining cases, the Chinese government limited and partly prohibited reporting. According to available official information, all six men were tried by Chinese courts, found guilty, and \nexecuted. \n6. The Chinese word for socialism is made up of the words shehui (\u2018society\u2019 or \u2018social\u2019) and zhuyi (\u2018-ism\u2019). \n7. See for instance Anagnost 2004. \n8. Yang Jie researched the struggles of men laid off by state enterprises following privatization. The \u2018crisis of masculinity\u2019 they experience in the wake of losing their livelihood \nbecomes a problem for social stability. These men sometimes turn the language of family and gender against \u2018kindly power\u2019 itself, by expressing their disappointment and discontent with \nstate and society (Yang 2010).  \n \nAnagnost, A. 2004.
