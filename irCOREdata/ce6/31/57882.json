Initially, the City developed on a low sandstone hill close to the north bank of the \nriver, which provided a secure, well-drained location above the marshes that bordered the \nriver. Geologically, Nottingham stands at the boundary between Palaeozoic rocks to the north \nand west, and Mesozoic and Cainozoic strata to the south and east. The area is underlain by \ncoal-bearing Carboniferous Coal Measures, Permian dolomitic limestones, Permo-Triassic \nmudstones and weak sandstones, Jurassic clays and Quaternary glacial and alluvial deposits. \nArtificial deposits, resulting from the social, industrial and mineral extraction activities of the \npast cover the natural deposits over much of the area. \n \nThis geological environment has underpinned the economic development of the area through \nthe mining of coal (now largely ceased), oil extraction that was important during the Second \nWorld War, brickmaking from clays, alluvial sand and gravel extraction from the Trent \nValley and gypsum extraction from the Permo-Triassic mudstones. The Permo-Triassic \nsandstone is a nationally important aquifer and has also been exploited at the surface and from \nshallow mines for sand. \n \nHowever, this history of the use and exploitation of mineral deposits has created a number of \nenvironmental problems including rising groundwater levels, abandoned mine shafts and \nmining subsidence, and, within the City itself, the occasional collapse of artificial cavities in \nthe sandstone and contaminated land left by industrial activities. Natural constraints on \ndevelopment include gypsum dissolution, landslides, rockfalls, swell-shrink problems in \nJurassic clays and flooding. Occasional minor earthquakes are attributed to movements due to \ncoal mining or natural, deep geological structures. Thus, Nottingham\u2019s geological context \nremains an important consideration when planning its future regeneration and development \n \nIntroduction \n Legget (1987) stated that \u201cland is the surface expression of geology\u201d and advised that \u201cland-\nuse planning can only be carried out with satisfaction if there is a proper understanding of the \ngeology concerned.\u201d Therefore, geology must be considered at an early stage in the land-use \nplanning process. In the case of Nottingham, its history is intimately bound up within its \ngeological setting. \n  \nThe City of Nottingham and its suburbs straddle the River Trent, the City itself being located \non sandstone hills close to a suitable bridging position on this major navigable river (Figure \n1). The broad relatively flat valley floor contrasts with dissected high ground to the north and \nsouth of the river. Although the earliest settlement may date back to Roman times (or before), \nthe earliest record of Nottingham\u2019s existence dates back to the invasion of the Danes in the \nmiddle of the 9th Century and their conquering of the settlement in 867 AD. The settlement \nwas built on a prominent sandstone hill, above the River Trent, which could be excavated to \ncreate cave dwellings. Construction of the first castle, by the Normans, began in 1068 on a \nsecond, adjacent hill. The City gained a Royal charter in 1155. In the Middle Ages, the main \nindustry was woollen manufacture. The population rose from about 1 500 at the time of the \nNorman invasion to 5 000 at the end of the 17th century, and over 28 000 at the time of the \nfirst census in 1801. Industry expanded in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the main ones \nbeing textiles, cigarette manufacture, bicycles and pharmaceuticals. The population expanded \nrapidly in the 19th century but the City\u2019s response was poorly planned, resulting in the \ncreation of appalling slums. The latter part of the 20th century has seen a gradual move from \nan economy based on heavy industry to one based on light manufacturing and services. The \npopulation now stands at about 260 000. \n \nThe bedrock of the Nottingham area includes rocks of late Carboniferous to Jurassic in age. \nThese are overlain by extensive superficial deposits of glacial and post-glacial material such \nas till, alluvium, sand and gravel. Faults trend from north-west to south-east across the area \ndisplacing the outcrops of Coal Measures and Triassic rocks at the surface. The Nottingham \narea is well endowed with mineral deposits including coal and gypsum that have been both \nmined and worked at the surface. Gravel, sand, brick clays and building stone also are present \nin workable amounts. Furthermore, the Sherwood Sandstone (Trias) is the second most \nimportant aquifer in England, supplying water to Nottingham and other areas that it underlies. \n \nAdverse ground conditions represent the principal environmental restraint on planning and \ndevelopment in the Nottingham area. The suitability of the natural ground to a particular \nengineering requirement depends mainly on the geotechnical properties of the soils or rocks \nthat are present. In addition, the ground conditions may have been affected by human activity. \nIn particular, coal mining has a long history in the area and has left a legacy of disturbed \nstrata, abandoned shafts and deteriorating workings. Old gypsum mines are also present, as \nare artificial cavities in the sandstones beneath the City formally used for storage, shelter or \nminor industrial activities. Other factors that may complicate the ground conditions include \ndisused quarries and pits, which may have been used for the disposal of a variety of waste \nmaterials. \n \nBedrock geology \nThe oldest rocks of the Nottingham area are Carboniferous in age and occur to the west of the \nCity centre (Figure 2). The oldest of these, that are found at the surface, belong to the Lower \nCoal Measures, are 290 to 440 m in thickness and occur in the far west of the Nottingham \narea. Borehole evidence indicates that below them there are more than 600 m of rocks of \nNamurian age, principally gritstones, and that these, in turn, are underlain by some 150 m of \nlimestones, sandstones and mudstones of Dinantian age. These Namurian and Dinantian strata \noutcrop to the west of the area in the southern Pennine Hills. \n  \nThe Middle Coal Measures also sub-crop to the west of the centre of Nottingham where the \ncomplete sequence ranges in thickness from 215 to 325 m. The Upper Coal Measures do not \noccur on the surface in the area and are only present, at depth, in the extreme south and west \nof the district where their maximum recorded thickness is around 170 m. Mudstone and \nsiltstone and, to a lesser extent sandstone, comprise most of the Coal Measures. Their \neconomic significance derives primarily from the presence of coal and, to a lesser extent, \ngannister, fireclay, ironstone, pottery clay and brick clay. Coal Measures sandstone has been \nused for buildings purposes. Regional uplift of the Pennine area by the Variscan Orogeny in \nthe late Carboniferous resulted in a long period of denudation that extended into early \nPermian times and resulted in the removal of massive amounts of Carboniferous strata. \n \nThe Permian strata form an area of gently undulating upland with a west facing escarpment \n(Figure 3). The rocks rest unconformably on the Coal Measures and dip gently to the east. \nThe earliest Permian deposits consist of breccias deposited under continental conditions. \nThese deposits are diachronous and range in age across the area from early to late Permian \nand in thickness from 0 to 8 m. The Basal Breccia is succeeded by the Cadeby Formation, \nwhich consists of a lower mudstone facies followed by an overlying carbonate facies. The \nmudstone facies is a few metres thick and thins out to the south but thickens eastward. Most \nof the rocks of the carbonate facies are dolomites that were originally deposited as limestones. \nThey thicken to the north and reach a maximum of 65 m. The uppermost formation in the \nPermian is the Edlington Formation. This consists of silty mudstone with thin beds of \ndolomitic sandstone. It is no more than 9 m thick where it outcrops and dies out to the south.  \nHowever, in the north-east nearly 30 m of these deposits have been found in boreholes. \n \nThe strata of Triassic age in the Nottingham area fall into two groups, namely, the Sherwood \nSandstone Group and the overlying Mercia Mudstone Group (Figure 2). The Sherwood \nSandstone Group is subdivided into the Lenton Sandstone Formation below and the \nNottingham Castle Sandstone Formation above (Bell & Culshaw 1993). The Lenton \nSandstone Formation is a poorly-cemented, fine to medium-grained friable sandstone with \nlenses of mudstone and siltstone, and occasional gravelly horizons. The sandstones are \ncommonly reddish in colour with yellow mottling and range up to 30 m in thickness. The \nNottingham Castle Sandstone forms a notable outcrop northwards from the City and consists \nof buff to pale red-brown sandstone. Subordinate horizons of siltstone, mudstone and \nconglomerate occur within this sandstone and it tends to vary both vertically and laterally \nover short distances. The Nottingham Castle Sandstone thickens to the north from some 65 m \nin the south to around 150 m in the north. The sandstones of both formations consist \npredominantly of quartz particles, the quartz content commonly comprising over 90% of the \nrock. \n \nThe Mercia Mudstone Group may be regarded as a fining upward sequence of strata of mostly \nhypersaline lacustrine sediments in which occurs coarser material and gypsum (Firman & \nLovell 1988). The Sneinton Formation occurs at the base of the Mercia Mudstone Group. \nAccording to Bell & Culshaw (1998), the basal 6 to 9 m of the Sneinton Formation consists of \npale grey mudstones that are, in part, finely micaceous with some silty and sandy beds. \nOverlying these basal beds are over 60 m of interbedded sandstones, siltstones and mudstones \nthat pass up into the Radcliffe Formation without marked change in lithology. Medium to \nthick beds of sandstone, which are generally reddish-brown in colour, are present at some \nlocalities. The principal constituent in these sandstones is quartz, averaging almost 75%. \nFeldspar is a secondary constituent and clay size material, which forms the matrix of the \nsandstones, constitutes between 4 and 18%. Commonly, the Sneinton Formation gives rise to \nundulating, incised topography in which the more resistant beds of sandstone locally give rise \nto more marked features. However, most of the formation is overlain by alluvial deposits of \nthe River Trent and its tributaries. The succeeding Radcliffe Formation consists of reddish-\nbrown and grey-green, laminated mudstones and siltstones with subordinate fine-grained \nsandstone. Then follows the Gunthorpe Formation, a sequence of interlayered mudstone, \nsiltstone and fine-grained sandstone.  Again the rocks tend to be reddish-brown or grey-green \nin colour. Numerous dolomitic siltstone and fine-grained sandstone beds frequently form \nupstanding topographic features (Charsley et al. 1990). Some intricate patterns of gypsum \nveins are found, notably in the upper part of the sequence. The formation varies in thickness \nfrom about 50 to 80 m. The Cotgrave Sandstone forms the base of the following Edwalton \nFormation and is some 1.5 to 4 m thick. Most of the rest of the formation comprises reddish-\nbrown and grey-green, silty mudstone or siltstone except for the uppermost 7 m of alternating \nsandstones and mudstones that are referred to as the Holygate Sandstone. The whole of the \nEdwalton Formation ranges from about 35 to 54 m in thickness. The latter formation is \nsucceeded by the Cropwell Bishop Formation, another sequence of reddish brown mudstones \nand siltstones with fine-grained sandstones. Thick units of stratiform gypsum (the Tutbury \nand the Newark Gypsum beds) occur locally in this formation but, generally, the formation is \npoorly exposed. It varies in thickness between about 35 and 55 m. Lastly, the Blue Anchor \nFormation represents the uppermost strata in the Mercia Mudstone Group. This consists of \napproximately 6 to 8 m of greenish, dolomitic mudstone and siltstone. It occurs in the south of \nthe area but is poorly exposed except in pits or quarries (Figure 4). \n \nThe Penarth Group represents a transition stage between the Triassic and Jurassic systems. It \nconsists of two formations, namely, the lower Westbury Formation and the upper Lilstock \nFormation. The former consists of grey to black mudstone with thin lenses of sandstone \ntowards the top. It is some 5 to 7 m thick and outcrops in the south of the area where it often \nforms an escarpment (Figure 3). A thin bed, referred to as the Rhaetic Bone Bed, occurs \nsporadically at the base of the formation and contains fossil remains of fish and reptiles. The \nCotham Member is the only representative of the Lilstock Formation in the Nottingham \ndistrict and is around 3 to 5 m thick, and similarly outcrops in the south of the area. It consists \nof grey silty mudstone with discontinuous bands of limestone nodules and is capped by a thin \nbed of limestone. \n \nThe strata of the Lias Group of the Jurassic system occur in the south of the Nottingham \ndistrict to the east and south of the Penarth Group (Figure 2). Only the lowest unit of the Lias \nGroup, the Scunthorpe Mudstone Formation, is represented in the area. The Barnstone \nMember occurs at the base of this formation and comprises alternating beds of calcareous \nmudstone and limestone. It is about 6 m thick in this area and is succeeded by mudstone of \nthe Barnby Member. \n \nThe bedrock geology is described in more detail by Howard et al. (in press). \n \nStructural geology \nThe Carboniferous rocks of the region were subjected to uplift during the Variscan Orogeny \nand underwent a period of erosion prior to the deposition of Permian strata. Appreciable \nfaulting also took place as a result of the Variscan Orogeny and the major faults may reflect \ndeeper basement structures. Periodic tectonic activity occurred during the Mesozoic era, \nwhich led to new faults being formed and some older faults being reactivated. The regional \ndip of the Carboniferous strata in the Nottingham area is generally towards the north-east at \nlow angles (Charsley et al. 1990). The post-Carboniferous strata have not been affected by the \nVariscan Orogeny but by the younger Alpine Orogeny. The regional dip of these rocks is \nbroadly towards the south east, at low angles, rarely greater than 2\uf0b0 (Figure 3). Angles of dip \nmay increase locally due to fold structures or to drag adjacent to faults (Figure 4). A broad \nregional syncline, with gently dipping limbs and a shallow plunge to the east-south-east, \noccurs to the immediate south of Nottingham, which is complemented by anticlines to the \nnorth and south (Edwards 1951). The predominant trend of the faults varies between west to \neast and north-west to south-east. Another set of faults of lesser importance trend in a north-\nwest to south-east or north to south direction. \n \nSuperficial deposits \nThe distribution of superficial deposits in the Nottingham district is shown in Figure 5. These \ndeposits consist of till, gravel and sand, silt, clay and organic material, which were formed \nunder glacial, fluvio-glacial, periglacial, lacustrine and fluviatile conditions. The glacial tills \nare found chiefly in the south-east of the area where they occupy the higher ground, or as \nisolated patches in valleys. The thickest deposits occur on the Wolds, to the east of \nNottingham, where as much as 35 m have been recorded. Generally, the till consists of silty or \nsandy clays with pebbles and cobbles. Where sand is the main component, the material is \nreferred to as sandy till. \n \nDeposits of glacial sand and gravel, with or without flint gravel, are found in the extreme \nsouth of the Nottingham area, where they may be up to 4 m thick. Further north small patches \nof flint-free sand and gravel are present on higher ground. \n \nFluvial and possibly fluvio-glacial deposits of sand and gravel were formed during later \nPleistocene times. Firman & Lovell (1988) referred to a series of terraces being present in the \nNottingham area and Charsley et al. (1990) indicated that the Bassingfield, Beeston and \nHolme Pierrepont Sands and Gravels are terrace deposits of the River Trent (Figure 5). The \nfirst consists of sand and sandy gravel that is clayey in places and contains discontinuous beds \nof clay; the second may be up to 4 m in thickness at Beeston and the third is composed of \nsand and gravel with impersistent beds of silt or silty clay. They have been eroded \nperiodically and redeposited by the present day, much smaller, River Trent.   \n \nHead is a deposit that has moved downslope and accumulated on lower slopes and in valley \nbottoms. Head is an unstratified or poorly stratified accumulation of particles and fragments \nof local origin that may mantle higher ground, or occur on slopes and in the bottoms of \nvalleys. It is usually formed under periglacial conditions by solifluction, that is, the bodily \ncreep of soil downhill. A veneer of Head is present in many areas and may be up to 4 m thick \nin places. It varies in character from relatively pure sand or clay to a chaotic mixture of clay, \nsilt, sand and gravel. \n  \nLacustrine deposits, locally up to 4 m in thickness, occur south of the River Trent near \nEdwalton and Ruddington, and on Ruddington Moor (south west of Ruddington) (Figure 5). \nThe lowermost beds show signs of cryoturbation and contain reworked debris from \nunderlying units. Higher beds consist of silt or clay, which may be laminated or massive. \nFossils are present in this material and, locally, the shell debris may be sufficiently \nconcentrated to be mapped as \u2018Shell Marl\u2019. Organic clay and peat occur in the upper layers of \nthese lacustrine deposits. \n Alluvial deposits occupy the floor of the River Trent and many of its tributaries. The alluvium \nconsists of silts and clays overlying sands and gravels. Thicker deposits of sand and gravel \noccur within the Trent Valley and probably represent infills that have been redeposited during \ntimes of flood. Lenses of peat, that accumulated in cut-offs, occur within the alluvium and can \nbe an unexpected cause of poor ground conditions. \n \nThe superficial deposits are described in more detail by Howard et al. (2008). \n \nArtificial deposits \nHuman influence on the heavily urbanized Nottingham area has been substantial (Charsley et \nal. 1990). This is illustrated in Figure 6, which shows significant areas of made, infilled and \ndisturbed ground in the area. Made ground consists of material that has been deposited on top \nof the original land surface. Therefore, it includes areas of construction such as embankments \nfor roads, railways and canals. Made ground in some areas may be thicker than the alluvial \ndeposits beneath. For example, in the Dunkirk\u2013Lenton Lane industrial area made ground is \nover 10 m in thickness in some areas. Many areas of made ground have been reclaimed and \nlandscaped or built over. Infilled ground occurs where excavations or depressions have been \ninfilled artificially. \n \nLandscaped ground refers to those areas where the original land surface has been extensively \nremodelled. It consists mainly of topsoil, subsoil that has been reworked within a location \nsuch as a housing estate or golf course. However, additional material such as soil, colliery \nspoil or building waste may have been brought to a site from elsewhere. Landscaping is \nubiquitous within most urban areas. Built-over ground comprises those parts of the area, \ngiven over primarily to urban development, where appreciable modification and disturbance \nof the land surface has taken place at the construction stage. Usually, it excludes extensive \nareas of landscaped ground but both may exist together in places. \n \nGeological resources \nThe Nottingham area is well endowed with mineral resources, especially coal and \ngroundwater. Other resources include sand, gravel, brick clay, dimension stone, gypsum, and  \nsmall deposits of oil, discovered in the 20th century and possibly with the potential for some \nrenewed production in the 21st. \n Coal   \nCoal has been mined in the Nottingham area for hundreds of years. Moller (1925) reported \nevidence of commercial scale coal mining in 1610. The first workings were from outcrops \nand then from bell pits, the scars of which may still be seen in Strelley (Ager et al. 2004). The \npillar and stall method of working was developed around the sixteenth century and longwall \nmining began to evolve in tandem with the Industrial Revolution (Bell 1988). The extent of \ncolliery-based underground coal mining is shown in Figure 7. However, as a result of the \ncontraction that has taken place in the deep coal mining industry since the late 1980s, coal \nmines are no longer operational in the area. Nonetheless, the coal resources beneath the area \nremain substantial (Charsley et al. 1990). Opencast mining developed in the Nottingham \ndistrict from the 1940s onward. These surface workings may extend to a depth of 100 m and, \nthus, the potential for opencast mining extends beyond the exposed coalfield into that part of \nthe concealed coalfield where Coal Measures occur at shallow depth beneath Permian strata. \nHowever, urban development and local community opposition means that the potential for \nopencast development is constrained.  \n \nSand and gravel \nGravel and sand deposits, which were laid down by the present and former River Trent are \nextracted for use in the construction industry. Worked deposits include gravel from beneath \nthe present flood plain and from the river terraces alongside it, that is, the Holme Pierrepont, \nBassingfield and Beeston Terraces. The silt and clay overburden is usually less than 1 m \nthick. Generally, the gravels and sands are thickest in the centre of the floodplain, the \nthickness varying from zero to over 4.5 m. Many of the gravel and sand resources have been \nsterilized by urban development. Both the Lenton Sandstone and Nottingham Castle \nSandstone have been worked for sand, both being weakly cemented and relatively easy to \nwork. Sand obtained from both these formations possesses finer and more rounded grains than \nthat obtained from the Trent Valley deposits making them more suitable for use as mortar or \nin asphalt than sand from the latter. \n \nBrick clay \nThe principal sources of brick clay in the Nottingham area are from the Edlington Formation \nand the Mercia Mudstone Group. Mudrocks from the Edlington Formation were extracted for \nbrick making in the north west of the area but no brickworks are currently active. The \nmudrocks of the Mercia Mudstone Group\u2019s Gunthorpe Formation were extracted for brick \nmaking at Dorket Head and, elsewhere, have been worked to the east and south of the City. \nMainly the lower and upper parts of the formation were worked. Mudrocks from the Middle \nCoal Measures were worked formerly and, because of their mineralogical composition, the \nshales and mudstones from the Coal Measures often produced a high quality brick, frequently \nof engineering grade. \n \nGypsum \nGypsum has been extracted for many years to make plaster related products for use in the \nbuilding and construction industry and, in the distant past, locally extracted alabaster was \nused in local churches for plaques commemorating benefactors, altars, tombs and statues. The \nworks of Nottingham\u2019s kervers (alabaster carvers) were to be found throughout England and \nwere particularly popular in France. \n  \nGypsum was extracted by both surface pits and underground by pillar and stall methods.  \nAccording to Firman (1964), gypsum was worked around East Bridgford from the \nseventeenth or eighteenth century until the 1940s from mines and shallow pits. The gypsum \noccurs primarily as crosscutting veins but also may run parallel to the bedding. Gypsum \noccurs in the lower part of the Edwalton Formation and the underlying Gunthorpe Formation \nbut the principal formation from which gypsum has been worked is the Cropwell Bishop \nFormation (Figure 4), the main gypsum horizons being the Tutbury Gypsum and the Newark \nGypsum. Firman described the Tutbury Gypsum as consisting of a composite unit of gypsum \nwith subordinate mudstone, which averages 2.4 m in thickness but can be as much as 6 m \nthick. Gypsum occurs as coarsely crystalline beds, nodules or lenticular masses. The Tutbury \nGypsum was extensively mined around Gotham Hill and is still mined using pillar and stall \nmethods near East Leake. The Newark Gypsum is made up of multiple beds that vary in form. \nSherlock & Hollingworth (1938) maintained that the Newark Gypsum was approximately 15 \nto 25 m in thickness and may consist of up to 16 beds of gypsum separated by mudstone in \nwhich reticulate veins of gypsum may be present. The mudstone layers may be up to a metre \nthick. The dimensions of the layers of gypsum vary. They may be lens-shaped or nodular. The \nnodules have been referred to as \u2018cakes\u2019 and tend to consist of massive gypsum often fringed \nby fibrous gypsum. These nodules are either flat or convex on top. Layers of gypsum \noccasionally expand and unite into large masses, and have been given individual names such \nas the Top White Rock, Riders, Middle White Rock and Blue Rock. The thicker Top White \nRock is white in colour with a saccharoidal texture and is one of the purer forms of gypsum, \nwith only about 4% of impurities (Bell 1994). The gypsum of the Riders usually has a slightly \nbluish or pink shade indicative of the presence of mudstone. This material usually consists of \nless than 90% gypsum and at times may contain up to 25% of impurities. The gypsum in the \nMiddle White Rock is white in colour and is medium to coarsely crystalline. It contains very \nfine veins of gypsiferous mudstone and a few mudstone inclusions that tend to stain the \nsurrounding gypsum. It contains between 5 and 10% of impurities. The Newark Gypsum, \naccording to Firman (1964), has been obtained by quarrying and underground mining around \nCropwell Bishop since the nineteenth century \n \nBuilding stone \nBuilding stone has been quarried in the Nottingham area since medieval times when \nsandstone from the Sneinton Formation was used by the Normans in the construction of the \nfirst Nottingham Castle. However, the principal dimension stone in the area is obtained from \nthe dolomite of the Cadeby Formation currently referred to locally as \u2018Bulwell Stone\u2019, which \nprobably also has been worked since medieval times. The dolomite outcrops over a large area \nin the north-west of the area where its thickness ranges from 6 to 12 m. The dolomite has a \ngranular texture resembling that of a sandstone but in places it has undergone recrystallization \nto produce a fine grained, well cemented dolomite. When first extracted, the rock is easy to \nwork but with time it dries out and the outer crust becomes hardened. \n \nGroundwater \nA copious, high quality water supply is obtained from the Sherwood Sandstone Group which \noutcrops beneath much of the City of Nottingham and underlies more than two thirds of the \nNottingham area from surface outcrop to depths of less than 280 m. This is the second most \nimportant aquifer in England next to the Chalk and yields water of such good quality that it \nonly needs basic chlorination for use as a public supply. However, high nitrate levels have \nbeen encountered, especially in some rural areas where the Sherwood Sandstone is exposed \nand the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers has been high. The whole area of the outcrop has \nbeen designated a nitrate vulnerable area (Allen et al. 1997). The Sherwood Sandstone in the \nNottingham area has been extensively developed for public and industrial water supply but \ngroundwater abstraction was uncontrolled before 1963 and the groundwater level was \nsignificantly depressed. Those streams that were dependent on baseflow discharge from the \naquifer were also adversely affected. Groundwater management policies introduced after \n1963, together with the decline in demand from industries, such as brewing, that depend on \nwater, have meant that groundwater levels have risen significantly giving problems in areas \nlike Basford. \n  \nGroundwater yield from the carbonate facies of the Cadeby Formation is erratic except where \nthere are well-developed systems of fissures. Usually, the yields of wells are only sufficient to \nsupply the needs of small farms and groundwater is not abstracted for public supply from this \nlimestone. The hardness of groundwater in the limestone is very high, in the range 400 to 600 \nmg l-1. Other formations in the area yield limited supplies of variable quality that are \nunsuitable for use as a public supply. \n \nOil \nThe importance of the location of UK oil resources had been recognised during the 1914-18 \nwar and a search was made focusing on the folds flanking the Pennines, a range of hills and \nmountains running down the centre of northern England. Some exploitable reserves were \nfound at Hardstoft, in Derbyshire, to the west of Nottingham, but not of sufficient importance \nto continue production after the war ended. However, the D\u2019Arcy Oil Company continued \nexploration in the interwar years with some slight success elsewhere in the UK but their most \nsignificant find was at Eakring in Nottinghamshire, to the north east of Nottingham. Their \nfirst well in 1939 (Eakring No 1) found oil in the sands of basal Coal Measures and in three \nother sand levels. The first deep well through the Carboniferous Limestone was Well 146 at \nDukes Wood where commercially important quantities of oil were found in very dark, fine \ngrained, phyllitic sandstones, dark grey quartzite and hard, black shale at a depth of between \n2274.7 and 2276.2 m below the ground surface (www.dukeswoodoilmuseum.co.uk). This \nwell and others at Caunton and Kelham Hills, in Nottinghamshire, were the start of the UK\u2019s \nfirst commercial onshore oilfield. During the start of the 1939-45 war this field was rapidly \ndeveloped at a time when oil was a vital war resource. However, in 1942 it was recognised \nthat the speed of development was limited by the drilling equipment that had been designed \nfor exploration not production. Therefore, arrangements were made to bring in modern, \nAmerican oil field production rigs and technology manned by 44 Oklahoma roughnecks. \nThus, a dramatic increase in productivity was achieved and a useful addition of 1.4 million \nbarrels of high quality oil to the UK\u2019s wartime oil supply was made by the Dukes Wood \noilfield alone. Production continued until 1971 by which time it had produced a total of 4.7 \nmillion barrels of oil. The site is now a nature reserve, which includes a trail that visits relics \nof its oil field past including a statue erected in 1991 commemorating and naming the 44 \u2018Oil \nPatch Warriors\u2019 from Oklahoma (Figures 8 and 9). \n \nGround conditions: bedrock \nThe bedrock strata usually provide satisfactory foundation conditions but still have the \npotential for geological hazards that may require avoidance, prevention or mitigation (Table \n1). A report (Forster 1989) on the engineering behaviour of the geological materials of the \nNottingham area, which included a summary of their geotechnical properties, was part of an \napplied geological study by the British Geological Survey for the (then) Department of the \nEnvironment (Charsley et al. 1990). Much of the geotechnical data quoted below are derived \nfrom that report. \n \nThe Lower and Upper Coal Measures are not exposed in the Nottingham area. The Middle \nCoal Measures comprise mainly mudrocks with subordinate sandstones. The clays of the \nMiddle Coal Measures normally are stiff to very stiff and range from intermediate to high \nplasticity. They tend to be of medium compressibility with undrained shear strengths varying \nfrom 50 to 300 kPa. Standard Penetration Test (SPT) \u2018N\u2019 values suggest allowable bearing \ncapacities ranging from 100 to 600 kPa. In some instances the pyrite content may be high \nenough to warrant precautions against sulphate attack on buried concrete and can result in \nacidic mine drainage from old workings. The sandstones, mudstones and coals have median \nvalues of unconfined compressive strength of 23 MPa, 8 MPa and 4 MPa respectively. \n \nThe mudstone facies of the Cadeby Formation consists of clays that tend to be firm to very \nstiff and more sandy components that are medium dense to dense. The moisture content of \nthese materials tends to decrease with depth that is reflected in a rise in undrained cohesion \nvalues. Values of plasticity vary from intermediate to high and allowable bearing capacities \ntend to be in the range 200 to 400 kPa. Normally, these materials are not likely to cause \nsulphate attack on buried concrete. The carbonate facies of this formation consists of granular \ndolomitic limestone with silty micaceous bands. However, according to Forster (1992), this \nfacies shows a wide range of lithological variation, with further variation being attributable to \nthe effects of weathering. On weathering, the dolomitic limestone tends to produce a sandy or \nsandy, silty, clayey material. The moisture content tends to increase with depth from about \n17% within 3 m of the surface to 5% or less at depths of over 6 m, which reflects the degree \nof weathering. The weathered fine-grained material has low plasticity whilst the dolomitic \nlimestone has an unconfined compressive strength usually ranging between 22 and 42 MPa. \nThe results of Standard Penetration Tests and those of undrained triaxial tests suggest that the \ncohesive weathered material has an allowable bearing capacity that may vary between 150 \nand 400 kPa. The dolomitic limestone is well jointed and the joints may be enlarged by \nweathering. Cambering on valley sides has tended to dilate joints to form gulls, which may \nremain open or be filled with superficial material. Karstic dissolution features occur within \nthe dolomitic limestone that can act as rapid pathways for pollutants to reach groundwater. \n \nThe mudrocks of the Edlington Formation also show a decrease in moisture content with \ndepth, with values between 12 and 46% within the upper 3 m whilst below that depth they \nrange from 12 to 22%, again reflecting a decrease in the degree of weathering with depth. \nThis may suggest that the lower limit of significant weathering occurs around 3 m below the \nground surface. Samples of mudrock exhibit a wide spread of plasticity values but most fall \nwithin the medium to high category.  Undrained triaxial test results suggest allowable bearing \ncapacity values between 100 and 300 kPa. Generally, the clayey material is firm to stiff and \nhas a medium degree of compressibility. \n \nThe Lenton Sandstone Formation consists of sandstones that generally are poorly cemented \nand contain lenses of mudstone and siltstone with occasional gravelly horizons. The \nsandstones consist dominantly of quartz particles and are fine to medium grained with a mean \ngrain size of around 0.19 mm (Bell & Culshaw 1993).  These sandstones generally are \nuniformly sorted and tend to have a low dry density, averaging around 1.83 Mg m-3 (Anon. \n1979).  They have a correspondingly high effective porosity with a mean value of 24%.  The \nsandstones of the Lenton Formation exhibit a higher permeability in the horizontal than the \nvertical direction but in both cases their primary (intergranular) permeability is only slightly \npermeable to very slightly permeable.  Groundwater yield is mainly by fissure flow.  In terms \nof strength, these sandstones fall just within the moderately strong category (Anon. 1970), \ntheir mean unconfined compressive strength being around 15 MPa. On saturation, the strength \nvalues decrease by about 35%. \n \nThe sandstones of the Nottingham Castle Sandstone Formation also consist predominantly of \nuniformly sorted quartz grains. However, these sandstones generally are medium-grained, \nwith a mean grain size of 0.27 mm. These poorly-cemented sandstones contain occasional \npebble layers and small lenses of siltstone and mudstone. Again, most of the sandstones of \nthis formation have a low dry density but some may be very low (mean value around 1.83 Mg \nm-3).  This is reflected in their high values of effective porosity, which may range from 22 to \n29% (Bell & Culshaw 1993). The mean coefficient of permeability of the sandstones of the \nNottingham Castle Sandstone Formation is higher than that of the Lenton Sandstone \nFormation, being 2.53 x 10-7 m s-1 compared with 1.28 x 10-7 m s-1. These values are for \nvertical primary permeability, which is about two thirds that of horizontal permeability. In \nfact, the majority of the sandstones of the Nottingham Castle Sandstone Formation are just \nslightly permeable. Most of these sandstones according to their unconfined compressive \nstrength could be described as either moderately weak or moderately strong, with values \nranging from less than 6 to 22 MPa. The unconfined compressive strength tends to decline \nwith increasing particle size and porosity. Furthermore, the strength of these sandstones is \nreduced to a greater extent on saturation than those of the Lenton Sandstone Formation, this \ntime by around 40% on average but this may be as high as 60% or as low as 23%. The largest \nreductions of strength on saturation tend to be in the weaker sandstones with higher \nporosities. The Nottingham Castle Sandstone Formation is deeply weathered, Standard \nPenetration Test results indicating that loose sand may be present to a depth of up to 4 m, with \nmedium dense sand as deep as 8 m and dense sand extending to 10 m but the weak nature of \nthe sandstone may make it difficult to determine the depth to rockhead by percussion drilling \nwith SPT \u2018N\u2019 value measurements (Forster 1992).  \n \nThe Sneinton Formation occurs at the base of the Mercia Mudstone Group and consists of \nmudstones overlain by interbedded sandstone siltstones and mudstones. These rocks tend to \nweather to give firm silty clays and dense sands respectively. The silty clays have a low \nplasticity and the results of Standard Penetration Tests suggest that allowable bearing capacity \nranges between 200 and 400 kPa. Consolidation data indicate that these clays are of medium \ncompressibility. Thick sandstones are present at some localities. These usually are either \nmedium or fine-grained with a mean grain size of 0.198 mm and are poorly sorted. The dry \ndensity of these sandstones has a relatively small range, it being from 2.22 to 2.31 Mg m-3, \nwhich is reflected in the small range of porosity, namely, 8.9 to 14.1%. The sandstones are \nmoderately strong (Anon. 1970) with a range of unconfined compressive strength from 17.4 \nto 39.8 MPa (Bell & Culshaw 1998). The loss of strength on saturation varies from about 19 \nto 45%. However, those sandstones with the highest saturation moisture contents do not \nnecessarily undergo the greatest loss in strength. Dobereiner & de Freitas (1986) suggested \nthat the strength of sandstones should be defined in terms of their saturated unconfined \ncompressive strength and that weak sandstones, in particular, should be regarded as those \nwith a saturated unconfined compressive strength in the range 0.5 to 20.0 MPa. The saturated \nunconfined compressive strength of the sandstones from the Sneinton Formation lie within the \nrange 14.1 to 25.6 MPa. Consequently, most of these sandstones would be classified as weak \naccording to the Dobereiner and de Freitas criterion. \n \nThe mudstones of the Radcliffe, Gunthorpe, Edwalton and Cropwell Bishop Formations of \nthe Mercia Mudstone Group consist of stiff to hard silty clayey material. Particle size analyses \ncarried out on fresh or less weathered mudstones from the Mercia Mudstone Group tend to \nhave a large proportion of silt sized particles whereas the clay fraction tends to predominate in \nthe more weathered material. Such an increase in the clay fraction of the weathered material \nsuggests that some silt-sized particles in the unweathered\/slightly weathered mudrocks may \nbe aggregates of clay sized particles (Davis 1968). The silt particles presumably are held \ntogether by cement that breaks down on weathering. Chandler (1969) recognized five zones \nof weathering from unweathered to fully weathered material. Weathering begins along the \nfissures in the mudrock. Such a generalized weathering profile may be modified considerably \nand lateral variations are not uncommon. The unweathered or slightly weathered mudrock \ngenerally has a low to intermediate plasticity. The plasticity index increases with the degree \nof weathering and when fully weathered the material can have a high plasticity. Similarly, the \nnatural moisture content increases with the degree of weathering whereas the bulk density \ndecreases. Values of undrained cohesion range up to 860 kPa, with weak zones of low \nstrength occurring at depths down to 15 m. The compressibility of the mudrocks tends to \nincrease with increasing degree of weathering, from 0.1 to 1.5 m2 MN. Usually, the sulphate \ncontent of these mudrocks is less than 0.2% so that in most cases ordinary concrete mixes can \nbe used for buried structures. Because of the presence of veins of gypsum in these mudrocks \nit might be expected that this would provide sulphate on breakdown that would adversely \naffect the cement fraction of concrete. However, the gypsum frequently is leached from the \nmudrock in the near-surface zone. A much fuller account of the engineering geology of the \nmudstones of the Mercia Mudstone Group has been provided by Hobbs et al. (2002) and of \nengineering in these mudstones by Chandler & Forster (2000). \n \nGypsum occurs at several horizons within the Mercia Mudstone Group but it is found \nprimarily in the Cropwell Bishop Formation. The Tutbury Gypsum and Newark Gypsum \noccur in this Formation. Bell (1994) found that the dry density of gypsum in the Nottingham \narea showed little variation, ranging from 2.21 to 2.26 Mg m-3 and that the effective porosity \nvaried from 1.5 to 6.6%. He found that the unconfined compressive strength tended to vary \nwith the amount of impurity present in the gypsum, that is, that gypsum with the lower \nimpurity content possessed lower values of strength. This was in accord with the suggestion \nmade by Skinner (1959) that impurities in calcium sulphate rocks tend to reduce the crystal \nsize and that the strength increases with decreasing crystal size. For example, the ranges of \nunconfined compressive strength for the three categories of gypsum related to impurity \ncontent mentioned above, least impurity first, were 12.2 to 28.0 MPa, 14.9 to 24.3 MPa and \n14.0 to 34.9 MPa respectively. The respective average values of strength were 18.2 MPa, 21.6 \nMPa and 24.1 MPa. These values of strength indicate that the gypsum can be regarded as \nmoderately strong rock (Anon. 1970). \n \nThe mudstones of the Scunthorpe Mudstone Formation are fissured and very stiff but are \noften soliflucted and cryoturbated in the upper few metres, particularly on sloping ground. \nThe median moisture content decreases with depth from about 25% at the surface to around \n16% at a depth of 4 m. The median bulk density also increases with depth from approximately \n1.97 Mg m-3 at the surface to 2.11 Mg m-3 below 4 m. The plasticity of the material increases \nwith the degree of weathering, tending to vary between intermediate and high plasticity. \nStrength also tends to vary with depth as the influence of weathering declines, the undrained \ncohesion increasing from 40 kPa to 180 kPa in the depth range 0 to 5 m. The weathered \nmaterial may be subject to swelling and shrinkage with changes in moisture content. Sulphate \nattack on buried structures is unlikely. \n \nGround conditions: superficial deposits \nTill is not widespread in the Nottingham area but is usually a sandy clay, of variable pebble \ncontent, with a low to intermediate plasticity. The moisture content and bulk density vary \nwithin the area, the former ranging from 15 to 30%, whilst the latter ranges from 1.8 to 2.3 \nMg m-3. The tills possess a low to medium compressibility with a coefficient of consolidation \nthat varies from 0.1 to 10 m2 yr-1. Values of cohesion tend to vary between 100 and 350 kPa \nand allowable bearing capacity between 200 and 600 kPa. Generally speaking, the tills do not \ngive rise to problems of sulphate attack on concrete below the ground surface. \n \nExtensive deposits of gravel and sand occur in the valley of the River Trent. The lowest, the \nHolme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel, is found beneath a capping of alluvial silty clay. They \nnormally comprise clean uniform gravels with some lenses of sand but silt and clay are only \nrarely present. The sand content varies from 30 to 50%. The results of Standard Penetration \nTests suggest that three zones of relative density are present. The material at the surface may \nbe relatively loosely packed with SPT \u2018N\u2019 values of around 10. A medium dense unit occurs \nbeneath the loosely packed unit and has an average SPT \u2018N\u2019 value of 25. This overlies a very \ndense unit in which the SPT \u2018N\u2019 values exceed 50. These gravels afford good foundation \nconditions with allowable bearing capacities ranging up to 600 kPa. They are free draining, \nhaving medium to high permeability (6.2 x 10-4 to 6.2 x 10-2 m s-1). In most instances, \nsulphate attack on buried concrete structures is not likely to occur. \n \nThe higher river terrace deposits consist of gravel, sand and sandy gravelly clay.  Standard \nPenetration Test \u2018N\u2019 values indicate that these deposits vary from medium dense to dense and \noccasionally may be very dense. The allowable bearing capacities of the gravel\/sand material \nrange from 100 to 400 kPa (Forster 1992). These deposits are unlikely to give rise to sulphate \nattack on buried concrete structures.  \n \nHead in the Nottingham area usually is thin and of variable composition depending on the \nnature of the parent material ranging from a cohesive soft to stiff material  to a non-cohesive \nloose to dense material. Head may be crudely stratified but normally is massive in \nappearance. However, this could be deceptive in that relict sub-horizontal shear planes may \nbe present and these may be reactivated if disturbed. If Head is composed of cohesive \nmaterial, then this generally is of low to intermediate plasticity but may be of high to very \nhigh plasticity where the parent material had such a plasticity (for example, the Scunthorpe \nMudstone). The cohesive material tends to have a low strength and in many instances may be \nclose to the residual strength of the parent material. Consolidation data indicate that the \ncohesive material is of medium to high compressibility. \n \nThe largest area of alluvium occurs in the valley of the River Trent where it generally lies on \ntop of extensive deposits of river gravel. It is composed primarily of normally consolidated \nclay, silty clay and sandy clay. Occasionally, organic rich layers and channels are present. The \nmoisture content of these alluvial soils tends to fall between 10 and 50% but in the organic \nmore peaty soils it can be as high as 420%. The clays range from low to high plasticity \ndepending on the proportion of clay, silt or sand they contain. Normally, the consistency \nvaries from soft to firm but on occasions very soft or stiff clays may be present in the \nalluvium. The clays, silts and organic deposits range in compressibility from medium to very \nhigh, possessing coefficients of consolidation between 0.1 and 100 m2 yr-1. Values of \nundrained cohesion range up to 200 kPa but mostly they are below 100 kPa. Sulphate attack \non buried concrete is not a common problem. \n \nDeposits of peat are present in the alluvium of the Trent valley and in post-glacial lacustrine \ndeposits. In the alluvium they tend to occur as relatively isolated pockets and channel infills. \nThe thickness of the peat varies but in one abandoned channel of the River Trent at Beeston \nup to 3.5 m of peat has been recorded (Charsley et al. 1990). Low strength, very high \ncompressibility and acidic character coupled with a potential to generate methane are \nproperties associated with peat. This can mean foundation failure and substantial settlement of \nbuildings placed on peat if precautions are not taken. Furthermore, because the peat occurs in \npockets or channel infillings, the possibility exists of a building being founded partly on peat \nand partly on much less compressible material, which will give rise to differential settlement. \nDepending on its thickness and depth of occurrence, peat may be removed and replaced with \nfill.  Alternatively, raft or piled foundation structures may be used. Gas proof membranes, \nwith passive venting, may be needed to mitigate ground gas risks.   \n \nGround conditions: artificial deposits \nA wide variety of material has been used as fill or for made ground including many types of \nwaste (Bell & Culshaw 2003). Thus the engineering behaviour of such areas depends upon \nthe material\u2019s composition, the method by which it was placed and any subsequent \ngeotechnical treatment. Non-engineered fills can be regarded as those that are placed without \nany control whereas engineered fills have been compacted to some extent or to achieve a \nspecified engineering performance, and consequently provide sufficient support for the \nengineering requirement. Waste fills may include inorganic mine waste, coarse colliery \ndiscard subject to spontaneous combustion, municipal and industrial wastes or combinations \nof some or all of them. Certain industrial wastes, in particular, may be contaminated. In the \nNottingham area archival data frequently proves inadequate to define the total distribution and \nlimits of former waste disposal sites. In addition, the character of the material at such sites \noften has not been recorded or has been recorded unreliably. The relevant local authority \ninspection strategy produced as a requirement of Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act \n(Department of the Environment 1990) provides an overview of both the industrial history \nand likely made ground deposits in the area. \n  \nThere are a large number of types of industrial wastes, which include chemical wastes, off \nspecification products, decommissioned plant, boiler and bottom ash. Industrial wastes \ncommonly are associated with derelict sites. Unfortunately, many industrial wastes are \ncontaminated to a greater or lesser extent and have the potential to cause harm to human \nhealth or the environment, including surface and ground water. Pulverized Fuel Ash (PFA) is \nwaste that is produced by coal-fired power stations, which were once common along the \nbanks of the Trent. The particles of PFA are primarily of silt size and are more or less \nspherical in shape. Their specific gravity ranges from around 1.90 to 2.72, depending on their \nsource and they are non-plastic.  Ashes may exhibit cohesive properties. Most PFA is used for \nland reclamation projects or for general and structural fills (for example, embankments, \nfoundation fills, fills behind retaining walls). In the Nottingham area, the most extensive \nspread of made ground in which there is industrial waste occurs between Beeston and the City \nCentre. This includes the Dunkirk-Lenton Lane industrial area where some of the thickest \ndeposits of made ground occur, in places being over 10 m thick.  The made ground south of \nWilford Lane and at the former Wilford Power Station includes some PFA. At the former site \nup to 6.5 m of PFA occurs locally. Pulverised Fuel Ash can contain total heavy metal \nconcentrations in excess of generic screening values; however, the bioavailability of these to \nhumans or ecological receptors is low. \n \nIn developed countries the nature and composition of waste has evolved over the decades, \nreflecting industrial and domestic practices. For example, in Britain domestic waste has \nchanged significantly since the 1950s, from largely ashes and little putrescible content of \nrelatively high density to low density, highly putrescible waste as domestic heating switched \nfrom burning coal (and domestic waste) to burning natural gas or oil. Hence, waste disposal \nor sanitary landfills now usually are very mixed in composition and suffer from continuing \norganic decomposition and physico-chemical breakdown. They can consist of a heterogenous \ncollection of almost anything including waste food, garden rubbish, paper, plastic, glass, \nrubber, cloth, ashes, building waste, tins and minor metallic items. Matter exists in the \ngaseous, liquid and solid states in landfills, and all landfills comprise a delicate and shifting \nbalance between the three states. Any assessment of the state of a landfill and its environment \nmust take into consideration the substances present in a landfill, and their mobility now and in \nthe future.  Much of the material of which a modern landfill is composed is capable of \nreacting with water to give a liquid rich in organic matter, mineral salts and bacteria, namely, \nleachate. Methane and hydrogen sulphide often are produced in the process and \naccumulations of these gases in pockets in fills followed by their lateral migration have led to \nexplosions in dwellings (Williams & Aitkenhead 1991). The leaching of soluble compounds \nfrom fill is another problem. Some materials such as ashes and industrial wastes may contain \nsulphate and other products that are potentially injurious as far as concrete is concerned. \nWaste materials disposed of in sanitary landfills have dry densities varying from 160 to 350 \nkg m-3 when tipped, but after compaction the density may exceed 600 kg m-3. Moisture \ncontents range from 10 to 50%, with average specific gravities of the solids varying from 1.7 \nto 2.5 and low bearing capacities between 19.2 to 33.5 kPa. Settlements associated with \nlandfills are likely to be large and irregular. The initial mechanical settlement of waste \ndisposal fills is rapid and is due to a reduction in the initial void ratio. It takes place with no \nbuild up of pore water pressure. Settlement continues due to a combination of secondary \ncompression (i.e. material disturbance) and physico-chemical and biochemical action. \nHowever, determination of the amount and rate of settlement of a landfill is not a simple task \nand a traditional soil mechanics approach for settlement prediction generally is unsatisfactory. \nWatts & Charles (1999) discussed the settlement characteristics of landfills and suggested \nvarious ground improvement techniques that could be used, notably the use of surcharge \nloading, to reduce post-construction settlement. \n \nUnlike some other waste fills, colliery spoil heaps usually have well defined boundaries. \nTheir distribution in the Nottingham area is shown in Figure 6. They consist of coarse \nmaterial that reflects the various rock types discarded during coal mining operations. \nObviously, the characteristics of coarse colliery discard differ according to the nature of the \nspoil. The method of tipping also influences the character of coarse discard. In addition, some \nspoil heaps, particularly those with relatively high coal contents, may be burnt, or still be \nburning, and this affects their mineralogical composition and physical properties. The \nmoisture content of spoil increases with increasing content of fines. Generally, it falls within \nthe range 5 to 15%. The range of specific gravity depends on the relative proportions of coal, \nshale, mudstone and sandstone in the spoil, and tends to vary between 1.7 and 2.7. The \nproportion of coal is of particular importance, the higher the coal content, the lower the \nspecific gravity. The bulk density of material in spoil heaps shows a wide variation, most \nmaterial falling within the range 1.5 to 2.5 Mg m-3. Low densities are mainly a function of \nlow specific gravity. Bulk density tends to increase with increasing clay content. As far as the \nparticle size distribution of coarse discard is concerned there is a wide variation, often most \nmaterial falls within the sand range but significant proportions of gravel and cobble range also \nmay be present. Subsequent breakdown on weathering reduces the particle size. The angle of \nshearing resistance of coarse discard usually varies from 25\uf0b0 to 45\uf0b0. With increasing content \nof fine coal, the angle of shearing resistance is reduced. Also, as the clay mineral content in \nspoil increases, so its shear strength decreases. The angle of shearing resistance is higher in \nspoil that has been burnt. The shear strength of discard within a spoil heap, and therefore its \nstability, is dependent upon the pore water pressures developed within it.  Pore water \npressures in spoil heaps may be developed as a result of the increasing weight of material \nadded during construction or by seepage though the heap of natural drainage. The relationship \nbetween permeability and the build-up of pore water pressures is crucial. In materials with a \ncoefficient of permeability of less than 5 x 10-9 m s-1 there is no dissipation of pore water \npressures, whilst above 5 x 10-7 m s-1 they are completely dissipated. The permeability of \ncolliery discard depends primarily upon its grading and its degree of compaction. It tends to \nvary between 1 x 10-4 and 5 x 10-8 m s-1, depending upon the amount of degradation in size \nthat has occurred.  \n \nSpontaneous combustion of carbonaceous material, frequently aggravated by the oxidation of \npyrite, is the most common cause of burning spoil. In fact, hot spots may occur within spoil \nheaps that have temperatures around 600\uf0b0C or occasionally up to 900\uf0b0C (Bell 1996). \nSpontaneous combustion may give rise to subsurface cavities in spoil heaps, the roofs of \nwhich may be incapable of supporting a person. Burnt ashes also may cover zones that are \nred-hot to appreciable depths. When steam comes in contact with red-hot carbonaceous \nmaterial, water gas (hydrogen and carbon monoxide) is formed, and when the latter is mixed \nwith air, over a wide range of concentrations, it becomes potentially explosive. Noxious gases \nare emitted from burning spoil. These include carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, sulphur \ndioxide and, less frequently, hydrogen sulphide. Acid mine drainage may be associated with \ncolliery spoil heaps. \n \nBackfilled excavations of various size and depth are widely spread across the Nottingham \narea. They may be opencast sites for coal, pits for sand, sand and gravel or brick clay, and \nquarries for aggregate, building stone or gypsum. Frequently, there is no surface indication of \ntheir former extent or, in some instance, their existence.  Moreover, there usually are no data \navailable regarding the nature of the compaction of the material backfilling these excavations. \nThe types of former excavations and the problems they may give rise to are summarized in \nTable 2. Opencast working of coal involves excavation to depths of up to around 100 m \nbelow the surface. However, restoration usually begins before a site is closed, which means \nthat worked out areas behind the excavation front are filled with rock waste. This involves \ntopsoil and subsoil being stripped and put into separate temporary dumps about the site. \nBecause of high stripping ratios (often 15:1 to 25:1) coupled with bulking, there usually is \nenough spoil to more or less fill the void. Part of the M1 motorway runs over a 1960s \nopencast coal mine in the western part of the Parish of Strelley. The water table at many \nopencast sites is lowered by pumping in order to provide dry working conditions in the pit.  \nThis can present a problem because significant settlements of opencast backfill can occur \nwhen the partially saturated material becomes saturated by rising groundwater after pumping \nhas ceased. In other words, settlement due to wetting collapse is more significant than that \ndue to the self-weight of the backfill (Blanchfield & Anderson 2000).   \n \nSome brick pits and old quarries are used as landfill sites. Former gravel pits, along the River \nTrent, where the water table is high, are allowed to flood when extraction ceases and are used \nfor amenity or recreational purposes such as marinas, water sports (Holme Pierrepont), nature \nreserves (Attenborough) and fishing (Gunthorpe). \n \nGeohazards and constraints on development \nThe constraints on development in the Nottingham area include slope instability, flooding, \ncollapsing mines and caves, land contamination and, to a minor degree, earthquakes.  \n \nLandslide \nSteep slopes are common in the Nottingham area but in most places they present little hazard \nto development unless they are disturbed by human activity or undercut by rivers. Landslides, \nfor example, occur along the bluffs and cliffs of the River Trent. Generally, mudstone and \ninterbedded mudstone and sandstone, which are exposed over two-thirds of the area, are \nstrong enough to sustain steep slopes (Charsley et al. 1990).  However, weathered material, \nHead or colluvium on such slopes is susceptible to movement if it is weakened by the ingress \nof water. For example, landsliding has occurred on the Penarth Group escarpment at \nCotgrave, and elsewhere, where the mudstones and black shales forming the slope have \nweathered to form clays of high to very high plasticity which, under the influence of water \ndraining from minor limestones in the Lias at the top of the slope, have generated minor \nlandsliding especially where undercut at the base. Furthermore, ancient slopes that developed \nunder different climatic conditions during wetter, colder Devensian times may be covered in \nHead that contains relict shear planes that can be reactivated by loading, undercutting or the \ningress of water. Rockfall and slab slides have occurred in the sandstones of the Sherwood \nSandstone Group and the dolomites of the Cadeby Formation. These types of failures have \ntaken place on the exposed sandstone in Nottingham and are mainly related to the occurrence \nof planes of weakness such as joints, bedding planes and faults, undercutting by the erosion of \nweaker sandstone beds and tree roots growing in discontinuities. In 1969 a slab weighing 18 \ntonnes fell from Castle Rock, beneath Nottingham Castle, but this is exceptional and even \nmuch smaller failures from rock faces are uncommon. \n \nFlooding \nMajor flooding of urban areas occurred in 1947 after which a programme of flood protection \nwas initiated. Further peak flows occurred in 1955, 1960 and 1977 but did not result in serious \nflooding in built up areas. Then, in November 2000, major flooding affected the whole of the \nTrent valley, as well as its larger tributaries. This was of slightly lesser magnitude than the \nflood of 1947 but nonetheless was regarded as a 50 year flood. Housing and farmland were \ninundated and important communication routes were disrupted for days afterwards. In fact, \nthe Midlands region experienced its wettest autumn on record, receiving 214% of the normal \nOctober rainfall, after the ground was saturated following an abnormally wet September. \nMuch of the terrain in the catchment areas is underlain by impermeable mudrocks of \nCarboniferous, Triassic and Jurassic age covered with patches of till.  These have low \ninfiltration capacities and so aided extremely rapid rates of runoff.  Hence, the river system \nquickly filled to its capacity and overflowed its banks.  Although protective defences saved \nmany places from inundation, they probably contributed to constriction and ponding \nelsewhere. However, parts of the valley remained dry due to the topography of the flood \nplain. For example, around Gunthorpe and Caythorpe the dry land corresponded closely with \nthe sands and gravels of the Holme Pierrepont Terrace that stands 2.5 m above the alluvium \nof the modern flood plain (Figure 10). Further flooding occurred in June 2007 associated with \nheavy, intense rainfall. This tended to cause localised \u2018flash-flooding\u2019 in the Nottingham area \ncaused, in part, by overland flow over desiccated ground, rather than inundation of extensive \nareas of the main flood plains. In response to the flooding, raising of the main flood \nembankments along the River Trent through Nottingham is being planned. \n \n \nCoal mining subsidence and collapse \nCoal has been mined in the Nottingham area since at least the Middle Ages and has left \nbehind a legacy of shafts, adits, subsurface workings and backfilled opencast pits over much \nof the area. These cause problems for the development and redevelopment of land, in \nparticular, subsidence of the ground surface that takes place above the workings when coal is \nremoved or subsequently when old workings collapse. Unfortunately, subsidence can have \nserious structural effects on surface buildings, can be responsible for flooding due to the \nlowering of the ground surface below the water table and, consequently, it can lead to the \nsterilization of land due to the need for special constructional design in site development or \nextensive remedial measures in developed areas (Bell 1988). One of the problems associated \nwith old workings is that there may be no record of their existence. In Britain the first statutory \nobligation to keep mine records dates from 1850 and it was not until 1872 that the production of \nmine plans for retention by the Mines Inspectorate became compulsory. Even if old records \nexist, they may be inaccurate. \n \nIn the case of pillared workings although the intrinsic strength of coal varies, the important factor \nas far as the pillars are concerned is that their ultimate behaviour is a function of bed thickness to \npillar width, the depth below ground and the size of the extraction area. Slow deterioration and \nfailure of pillars may take place long after mining operations have ceased. Even if pillars are \nrelatively stable, the surface may be affected by void migration as the roof between the pillars \ncollapses. This can take place within a few months or many years after mining ceased. The \nprocess can, at shallow depth, continue upwards to the ground surface leading to the sudden \nappearance of a crown hole. The maximum height of migration in exceptional cases might \nextend to 10 times the height of the original stall. However, it generally is 3 to 5 times the stall \nheight. \n \nAs far as old shafts are concerned, they may be unfilled or filled but in the case of the latter there \ncan be no guarantee of the effectiveness of their treatment unless it has been carried out in recent \nyears. The location of a shaft is of great importance in terms of the safety of a potential structure \nfor, although shaft collapse is fortunately an infrequent event, its occurrence can prove \ndisastrous. Moreover, from the economic point of view the sterilization of land due to the \nsuspected presence of a mine shaft is unrealistic. However, the number of shafts at a site can be \nlarge. Gunn et al. (2008) reported 36 recorded mine shafts at the Nottingham Business Park \ndevelopment near Strelley. Figure 11 shows one of these shafts exposed by partial collapse of \ninfill\/cover material. The site is approximately 0.8 km by 1.8 km in size, giving a maximum area \nof about 1.44 km2. This gives a shaft density, for known shafts, of 1 per 0.04 km2. They also \nobserved that the recorded locations should not be regarded as having a precision better than \u00b1 \n20 m in an easterly and a northerly direction. \n \nIn longwall mining the coal is exposed at a face of up to 300 m between two parallel roadways. \nThe roof is supported only in, and near, the roadways, and at the working face. After the coal has \nbeen won and loaded the face supports are advanced leaving the roof rocks, in the areas where \ncoal has been removed, to collapse. Subsidence at the surface more or less follows the advance \nof the working face and may be regarded as immediate. As longwall mining has ceased in the \nNottingham area it is assumed that subsidence due to this cause is unlikely in the future. Residual \nsubsidence, however, may take place for a number of years after working has ceased. Ground \nmovements induced at the surface by longwall mining activities are influenced by variations in \nthe ground conditions, especially by the near-surface rocks and superficial deposits. However, \nthe reactions of surface deposits to ground movements are usually difficult to predict reliably. \nIndeed, some 25% of all cases of mining subsidence undergo some measure of abnormal ground \nmovement that, at least in part, is attributable to the near-surface strata. Faults tend to be \nlocations where subsidence movement is concentrated, thereby causing abnormal deformation of \nthe surface. Whilst subsidence damage to structures located close to, or on, the surface outcrop of \na fault can be very severe, in any particular instance the areal extent of such damage is limited, \noften being confined to within a few metres of the outcrop. \n \nFault reactivation due to mining subsidence can occur during active mining or after mining has \nceased. In the 1950s, during mining from Clifton Colliery, some houses in West Bridgford \nsuffered severe damage as a result of differential subsidence associated with a major fault. \nDonnelly (2000) described a number of instances of fault reactivation in the Nottingham area, \nmost related to active mining. A number of problems, in addition to fault reactivation, can arise \nonce mining operations have ceased. These include the rise of water levels in a mine after the \ncessation of the pumping that kept the workings dry and possible problems due to acid mine \ndrainage, the escape of gas from poorly sealed mine shafts, and landsliding. \n \nGypsum mining subsidence and collapse \nSubsurface mining of gypsum has taken place at East Bridgford, Cropwell Bishop, East \nLeake, Bunny and on Gotham and Thrumpton hills. Satinspar was mined at East Bridgford. \nThis occurs as impersistent veins and was probably worked by following the veins. \nAccordingly, voids left by mining may have an irregular shape. Neither the actual depth nor \nextent of the workings is known except that they are shallow and some abandoned shafts have \nbeen located. Abandoned mine plans are held confidentially by British Gypsum for the \nworkings at Cropwell Bishop but there is a possibility that mining extended north of the \nrecorded workings. Mining probably took place in several seams within the Newark Gypsum, \nmainly by the pillar and stall method. Shallow outcrop workings are common at Gotham Hill \nextending towards Thrumpton, and workings from adits and shafts, which generally consist of \na series of randomly orientated tunnels and chambers, also are present.  Gypsum was \nextracted by the pillar and stall method at Weldon Mine (one of the four mines beneath \nGotham Hill, just west of Gotham) and the abandonment plan for the mine is available. \nHence, the potential for subsidence does exist in these areas although there is little evidence to \nsuggest that workings have collapsed. \n \nGypsum is much more soluble than limestone because 2200 mg l-1 of calcium sulphate can be \ndissolved in non-saline water compared with 400 mg l-1 of calcium carbonate. The solution \nrate of gypsum is controlled principally by the area of its surface in contact with water and the \nflow velocity of water associated with a unit area of the material. Hence, the amount of \nfissuring in a rock mass, and whether gypsum is enclosed by permeable or impermeable beds, \nis most important. In fact, widespread dissolution of gypsum has taken place within the \nMercia Mudstone in a zone a few metres in thickness beneath the subsoil or superficial \ndeposits, much of the solution having occurred along discontinuities (Firman & Dickson \n1968).  However, the depth of the solution zone may extend to a depth of some 30 m along \nfaults and heavily jointed areas (Elliott 1961). Solution depressions, accordingly, are present \nin parts of the Nottingham area and gypsum rarely is exposed at outcrop. Nonetheless, much \nof the gypsum in the Mercia Mudstone below the solution zone occurs as veins and thin \nnodules except for the Tutbury Gypsum and Newark Gypsum in the Cropwell Bishop \nFormation. This means that sizeable voids could only develop in these two gypsum horizons \nif suitable groundwater flow conditions existed. Because there is little evidence of solution \nhollows resulting from the sudden collapse of cavities it would appear that sizeable voids \nhave not developed. An exception may occur near Bradmore where some steep sided hollows \nmay be due to sudden collapse. Unconsolidated deposits that have accumulated in solution \ndepressions may be highly compressible and could give rise to excessive settlement if loaded. \n \n Sandstone cave collapse \nOver 400 man-made caves or cave systems are present in the sandstone beneath central \nNottingham (Figure. 12). Most of the caves are between 200 and 800 years old but some may \nbe over 1000 years old. They have been used for a variety of purposes such as storerooms, \ndwellings, breweries, tanneries, sources of building and domestic sand, waste disposal etc. A \nregister of those caves for which documentary evidence exists has been prepared by Owen \nand Walsby (1989). However, because of their age and the rebuilding that has been done over \nthe centuries it is likely that unknown caves are present in the sandstone. The distribution of \nthe caves closely reflects the outcrop of the Nottingham Castle Sandstone Formation, \nalthough they do not all occur in that formation (Figure 13). The sandstone is friable and can \nbe excavated easily with hand tools but because bedding and jointing are very widely spaced \nit can stand with vertical sides and support wide voids (Figure 14). Generally, the caves are 3 \nto 5 m in width and less than 10 m long. Many of the roofs are flat although some are arched \nand some of the wider caves have a central pillar to provide roof support.   \n \nAccording to Waltham (1993), three possible types of failure may be associated with the \ncaves. Firstly, he maintained that building foundations may lose their integrity if less than 3 m \nof sound rock exists above the top of the caves. However, there is no record of building \nsubsidence above the caves in more than 100 years. This probably is because building \nconstruction in Nottingham takes the presence of caves into consideration. It has meant that \nsome caves have been filled prior to construction (Walsby et al. 1993). The design of the \nBroadmarsh Shopping Centre development (in the centre of Nottingham) ensured historically \nimportant caves beneath it were preserved by a concrete beam that spanned them while some \nof the minor caves were infilled. In another development, in the centre of the City, the caves \nbeneath the site were retained for future use by carrying the frame of the building on \nreinforced concrete columns that extended through the cave roof onto concrete pad \nfoundations cast into the floor of the cave. Secondly, Waltham indicated that unloaded roofs \nmay undergo progressive failure and that this ultimately could lead to the development of \ncrown holes. The latter is uncommon although Waltham quoted the case of Stanford Street \nwhere a crown hole appeared in the road surface in June 1990. Thirdly, Waltham suggested \nthat sandstone roofs and walls could deteriorate rapidly where there are open entrances to \ncaves. As pointed out above, these sandstones can suffer a significant loss of strength when \nsaturated that can affect the behaviour of roofs adversely.  Indeed, Waltham mentioned that in \nthree caves the saturated roof beds had sagged away from the ceilings. Thus, the ingress of \nwater from construction sites to the sandstone should be prevented wherever possible, \nespecially where the sandstone above a cave is known to be less than 3 m. The water table \nbeneath the City has risen in recent years and this has meant that some caves that have been \nused as basements have been flooded. This may affect the foundations concerned adversely. \nIn fact, water levels have been lowered by pumping in the Broadmarsh complex. \n \nSubsidence investigation and remediation \nIf development is to be carried out at a site where natural or artificial voids are known or \nsuspected, the ground investigation should aim to detect their presence so that precautions can \nbe taken against their collapse. There are numerous references relating to how to undertake a \nground investigation in areas of abandoned mine workings such as Taylor (1968), Healy and \nHead (1984), Bell (1988) and Anon. (1999); and of how to locate old shafts (Anon. 1976). \nOne of the most difficult assessments to make is the possible effects of progressive \ndeterioration of voids in the ground and the consequent risk of subsidence. The most obvious \nway of dealing with old workings is to place a proposed structure away from any voids but if \nthis is not possible then an attempt can be made to stabilize the ground by grouting or to use \nspecialized foundation structures such as rafts. Discussion of the methods by which voids in \nthe ground may be dealt with is given by Anon. (1977), Healy & Head (1984) and Waltham et \nal. (2005) and of methods to deal with shafts by Anon. (1982).  \n \nAbandoned quarries and pits \nOld quarries and pits occur throughout the Nottingham Area. In the past, they were smaller in \nsize but more frequent than they are today when excavations, especially for sand and gravel \nand brickclay, are centred on a few large-scale workings. Former quarries and pits may have \nbeen filled or remain unfilled. Where they have been filled, the character of the backfill may \ndiffer from that of the host rock and the backfill may undergo more settlement when loaded \nthan the surrounding host rock.  Settlement at former opencast sites has been referred to above \nand if these are to be built over then, ideally, they should have been compacted properly. \nQuarries and pits frequently are used to dispose of waste, if the ground conditions are \nsuitable. Not only are such landfills likely to settle but they also may generate methane if the \nwaste contains organic material. Ideally, they should be developed as open spaces rather than \nbe built over. \n \n Groundwater pollution \nPublic water supply wells draw water from the Sherwood Sandstone Formation. The \nlimestones of the Cadeby Formation also supply water locally to farms but not to public \nsupply. The Coal Measures and other formations yield only limited supplies of groundwater \nfor local use. To avoid groundwater pollution groundwater protection zones have been \nestablished within a radius of 1 km around wells in the Sherwood Sandstone Formation so \nthat development likely to cause pollution is avoided. The location of waste disposal sites \nshould be chosen with care so avoid the pollution of groundwater by leachates. Also, the \nextensive use of nitrogen based fertilizer has given rise to nitrate pollution, especially in rural \nareas where the limestone and sandstone is exposed. Acid mine drainage can cause pollution \nof aquifers in the Coal Measures. However, abandonment of the South Nottinghamshire \nCoalfield and the cessation of pumping minewater raise concerns over the security of the \nSherwood Sandstone Formation that overlies the concealed part of the coalfield. Dumpleton \net al. (2001) suggested that possible discharge of acid mine drainage both to the surface and \ninto the Sherwood Sandstone might take place some 20 years after the end of dewatering. \n \nContaminated land \nContaminated land has been a constraint on development for at least the past 20 years. The \nshift in the local and national economic base away from old, heavy, extractive and \nmanufacturing industries towards the light engineering and service industries has resulted in \nmuch redevelopment taking place on land affected by contamination. The long history of \nindustrial activity in Nottingham has resulted in the contamination of shallow soils and water \nin both shallow and deep aquifers. Coal mining has created voids and opened discontinuities \nthat both facilitate contaminant transport and act as a source of very low pH groundwater \n(Bell & Kerr 1993). Waste disposal sites may be sources of explosive and asphyxiating gases \nand pollutant-rich leachates. Such land requires a three-dimensional conceptual model to \nguide the design of a ground investigation that will refine the model and inform the appraisal \nof risk assessment and remediation options (Nathanail & Bardos 2004). Consequently, \nNottingham has been at the forefront of risk-based approaches to managing land \ncontamination. For example, the first soil washing project in the UK was used in the \nremediation of the Basford gasworks site, north of the City centre.  \n \n \n Seismicity \nEarthquakes are occasionally felt in the Nottingham area. These usually are of low intensity \nand give rise to little or no damage. However, on 11 February 1957, the Derby earthquake, \nwith its epicentre located near Diseworth, about 20 km south west of Nottingham, had an \nintensity of 6-7 on the European Macroseismic Scale (MSL) scale that affected the \nNottingham area. The earthquake had a magnitude of 5.3 ML. Such an earthquake can cause \nminor damage such as cracks in roofs and walls, broken windows and damage to, or the \ncollapse of, chimney stacks. The earthquake of 27 February 2008 at Market Rasen \n(Lincolnshire) (some 70 km north east of Nottingham) had a magnitude of 5.2 ML and an \nintensity of 6 (MSL). It occurred at an estimated depth 18.6 km and was felt across \nNottingham. It caused damage to the steeple of St Mary Magdalene Parish Church at \nWaltham-on-the-Wolds about 30 km south east of the city as well as damage to chimney \nstacks and roofs in the epicentral area. Movement on major faults at depth is a cause of \nearthquakes and the Nottingham area is crossed by several major faults that extend into the \nPre-Carboniferous basement. For instance, on 30 May 1984 the West Bridgford earthquake \nhad its focus at a depth of 15 km. Mining-induced seismicity has been recorded in the \nNottinghamshire coalfield but the risk of damage to properties by these events is low (Bishop \net al. 1993). \n \nConclusions \nNottingham owes it origin to the fortuitous combination of geology and geography that \nresulted in the presence of a low, well-drained sandstone hill close to a crossing point of the \nRiver Trent. This was aided by the geotechnical properties of the sandstone that allowed rock \nshelters to be easily cut in the abandoned river cliff on the south side of the hill. This simple \nbeginning was developed by slowly expanding westwards to a second hill when the Normans \ntook advantage of its strategic importance to build a castle on its well-protected, cliff-bounded \nsummit. \n \nThe City grew and industries developed supplied by an abundance of natural geological \nresources in the form of clean water, sandstone, limestone and coal, all within easy \ntransportation distance of the City. Thus, by the early 20th century Nottingham was a major \nindustrial centre of the East Midlands. However, after the middle of the 20th century the old \nheavy, dirty industries were in decline and were eventually superceded by lighter \nmanufacturing and service industries at the end of the 20th century. Along with this change \ncame new attitudes to the protection of the environment, natural resources and the health of \nthe population. Thus, Nottingham faced new challenges in its redevelopment that needed to \ndeal with the poor ground conditions left by its industrial past. Challenges included \ncontaminated ground, poor and uneven bearing capacity of made and infilled ground, \nunderground voids, explosive and asphyxiating gases and rising groundwater. \n \nNottingham has risen to these challenges and employed appropriate geological and \ngeotechnical expertise to deal with them and create a modern city with a vigorous economy \nand high quality of life for its citizens. Such an outcome is to be expected for a city at the \nheart of the area that houses the home of the British Geological Survey at Keyworth. \n \nAcknowledgements: This paper is published with the permission of the Executive Director of \nthe British Geological Survey (NERC). \n \nReferences  \nAllen, D.J., Brewerton, L.J., Coleby, L.M., Gibbs, B.R., Lewis, M.A., MacDonald, A.M., \nWagstaff, S.G. & Williams, A.T. 1997.

Flooding of the Trent Valley around Gunthorpe (east of Nottingham) in 2000. The dry \nland corresponds to the Holme Pierrepont Terrace that stands 2.5 m above the \nalluvium of the modern flood plain (photograph BGS \uf0d3 NERC). \n11. Approximately 2 m diameter shaft exposed at the site of the Nottingham Business \nPark near Strelley. The shaft is lined with dry-stacked red bricks and its collar is \nwithin 1.5 m of the ground surface. Infill material appeared to consist of soil, wooden \nlogs and metal objects (photograph BGS \uf0d3 NERC). \n12. Cave below the former Pearson\u2019s Department store with a wide stable roof and \nadditional support from a carved pillar in the background. The style of the cave and \nthe pillar indicate considerable age (photograph BGS \uf0d3 NERC). \n13. Distribution of known caves in a) the Nottingham area and b) central Nottingham. \n14. The Park Tunnel was built in 1855 to allow carriages access from a major residential \narea to Derby Road. The cutting shows massive cross bedded Nottingham Castle \nSandstone and the tunnel its ability to sustain stable wide spans for many years \n(photograph \uf0d3 A Forster). \n \nList of tables: \n1 Bedrock geology \u2013 factors affecting ground conditions. \n2 Types and methods of coal mining and associated land-use issues. \nTable 1.
