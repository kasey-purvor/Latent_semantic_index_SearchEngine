The inclusive\ncross sections, and also the partial cross sections for the population of individual bound final states\nof the 32Ar, 28S and 24Si knockout residues, have been determined using the combination of particle\nand \u03b3-ray spectroscopy. Similar to the two-proton knockout mechanism on the neutron-rich side\nof the nuclear chart, these two-neutron removal reactions from already neutron-deficient nuclei are\nalso shown to be consistent with a direct reaction mechanism.\nOver the past decade, direct one-nucleon knockout re-\nactions from fast beams [1] have been developed into a\nversatile tool applicable to structure studies of atomic\nnuclei beyond the valley of \u03b2 stability. The technique\nhas been used successfully to derive single-particle spec-\ntroscopic strengths and assign orbital angular momenta,\nto probe shell closures, and to study halo nuclei as well\nas correlation effects beyond effective-interaction theory\n[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. The asso-\nciated formalisms, used to calculate single-particle cross\nsections and to deduce spectroscopic factors and orbital\nangular momenta, employ few-body reaction theory in\neikonal approximation [17] and modern shell-model and\nHartree-Fock calculations [18, 19, 20]. For several well-\nstudied cases, results from intermediate-energy knockout\nreactions have been shown to be consistent with infor-\nmation obtained from alternative approaches [21].\nTwo-proton knockout from neutron-rich nuclei has re-\ncently been shown to proceed as a direct reaction [22]. In\nthat first reported experiment, two protons were removed\nfrom secondary beams of neutron-rich 28Mg, 30Mg, and\n34Si using a thick 9Be target. The reaction mechanism,\ninvolving sudden, peripheral collisions, is advantageous\nfor the study of exotic nuclei since, for a given incoming\nbeam, the residue from two-proton knockout is even more\nneutron-rich than that produced by one-proton removal,\nbut with still manageable cross sections. The method\nhas also been applied to study the very exotic nuclei 42Si\nand 44S [23]. A first theoretical description of the reac-\ntion process considered the stripping of two uncorrelated\nnucleons [22]. The correlations between the two removed\nnucleons within the initial nucleus have recently been in-\ncorporated via shell-model two-nucleon amplitudes [24].\nThese correlations were found to have a significant influ-\nence on the stripping partial cross sections to different\nfinal states, indicating that two-nucleon knockout reac-\ntions offer promise for accessing nuclear-structure infor-\nmation for very exotic nuclei and probe two-nucleon cor-\nrelation effects in asymmetric regimes [24].\nExperiments have, so far, employed only two-proton\nknockout on the neutron-rich side of the nuclear chart.\nThe present experiment provides the first measurements\nof two-neutron knockout from proton-rich nuclei. We re-\nport first results from the two-neutron removal reactions\n9Be(34Ar,32Ar)X, 9Be(30S,28S)X and 9Be(26Si,24Si)X in\nthe proximity of the proton dripline. These nuclei were\nchosen since (i) the respective projectiles and knockout\nresidues are expected to be well described by shell-model\ncalculations within the sd shell, and (ii) the proton-to-\nneutron asymmetry in these nuclei strongly favors a di-\nrect two-nucleon removal reaction mechanism. A pri-\nori, two-nucleon removal reactions are expected to have\nboth a direct and a multi-step component. However, the\nimportance of the latter will depend strongly upon the\nthresholds for nucleon emission. For illustration, we con-\nsider the 34Ar projectile where the dominant two-step,\ntwo-neutron removal would involve neutron evaporation\nfrom highly excited states in 33Ar (Fig. 1) formed by\nsingle-nucleon removal. However, due to the neutron-\ndeficiency of 33Ar, the proton evaporation channel opens\nfirst and neutron evaporation leading to 32Ar will be sup-\npressed (Sp(\n33Ar)= 3.3 MeV \u226a Sn(\n33Ar)= 15.3 MeV).\nThe same considerations apply to 30S and 26Si. Similar\narguments were applied in the work of Bazin et al. [22].\nThe projectiles of interest \u2013 34Ar, 30S and 26Si \u2013 were\nproduced by fragmentation of a 150 MeV\/nucleon 36Ar\nprimary beam provided by the Coupled Cyclotron Facil-\nity of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Labora-\ntory (NSCL) at Michigan State University. The 9Be pro-\nduction target was located at the mid-acceptance target\nposition of the A1900 fragment separator [25]. The beam\nimpinged on a 376 mg\/cm2 9Be secondary target located\nat the pivot point of the high-resolution, large-acceptance\nS800 magnetic spectrograph [26]. The averagemid-target\n2energies of the beams were 110 MeV\/nucleon for 34Ar,\n111 MeV\/nucleon for 30S and 109 MeV\/nucleon for 26Si.\nIncoming particles and reaction products were unambigu-\nously identified on an event-by-event basis. The inci-\ndent particles were characterized via their time-of-flight\n(ToF) taken between two beam-monitoring scintillators\nbefore the target (30 meters apart). The identification of\nthe reaction residues was performed with the detection\nsystem of the S800 focal plane: the energy loss (\u2206E)\nin the ionization chamber and the ToF measured be-\ntween the object point and the focal plane of the spectro-\ngraph. The time-of-flight information was corrected for\nthe flight-path difference of the various reaction residues\nusing the angle information provided by the position-\nsensitive cathode-readout drift chambers (CRDCs) [26]\nof the S800 focal plane. As an example, the \u2206E-ToF\nparticle identification of 24Si knockout residues in the fo-\ncal plane is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe inclusive cross sections for the two-neutron knock-\nout to all bound final states of 32Ar, 28S and 24Si were\nderived from the ratio of detected knockout fragments in\nthe S800 focal plane relative to the number of incoming\nprojectiles per number density of the 9Be target. Cor-\nrections for the finite acceptance of the spectrograph did\nnot exceed 15%. Systematic uncertainties arise from the\nparticle-identification gate (\u223c5%), purity and stability\nof the incoming beam (<5%) and acceptance corrections\n(<10%). These uncertainties have been added in quadra-\nture to the statistical errors.\nThe reaction mechanism has been probed via the\nparallel-momentum distributions of the ejectiles mea-\nsured in the S800 focal plane. The momentum distribu-\ntions were reconstructed from the known magnetic rigid-\nity of the spectrometer and the positions of the particles\nmeasured with the CRDCs.

Therefore, the two-neutron knockout from\n34Ar to 32Ar proceeds predominantly as a direct reaction.\nFIG. 2: Energy-loss vs. time-of-flight identification of the\nreaction residues detected in the S800 focal plane for incoming\n26Si projectiles.

The assump-\ntions made in the theoretical calculation are the same as\nin [22]: the neutrons are considered to be uncorrelated\nand so the momentum distribution for the two-neutron\nknockout is the convolution of the momentum distribu-\ntions from removal of each of the \u2113=2 neutrons. The\ntheoretical calculation has also been convoluted with the\nexperimental momentum spread of the incoming beam\n(\u223c 1 %). This comparison shows that the theory is in\ngood agreement with the experimental distribution of the\ntwo-nucleon knockout residues.

For\n24Si, the simulated response for the two photopeaks is shown\nseparately in dashed an dotted lines.\nreactions, the parallel-momentum distribution of knock-\nout residues is used to assign the \u2113-value of the removed\nnucleon. In two-nucleon knockout reactions, the parallel-\nmomentum distributions for different \u2113-values can be too\nsimilar to provide a clear assignment of the orbital angu-\nlar momentum.\nCross sections to individual excited states were mea-\nsured using particle-\u03b3 coincidences. The target was sur-\nrounded by the SeGA [27], an array of seventeen 32-fold\nsegmented high-purity Germanium detectors arranged\nin two rings as described in [28]. The event-by-event\nDoppler-corrected \u03b3-ray spectra for the 32Ar, 28S and\n24Si residues are presented in Fig. 4. The Doppler cor-\nrection has been performed by taking into account the\naverage velocity of the projectile at the time of the \u03b3-ray\nemission. Although an anisotropic angular distribution\nis expected, due to alignment effects in the knockout re-\naction, we assume that this can be neglected in the eval-\nuation of the intensities. The smallness of this correction\nis tied to the beam energy and to the particular choice of\nlaboratory angles for the \u03b3-ray detectors (37\u25e6 and 90\u25e6)\nin this experiment; see the example worked out in Fig.\n12 of Ref. [1] for one-nucleon knockout.\nIn the case of 32Ar (Sp = 2.4 MeV), only one \u03b3-ray\ntransition is observed at 1867(8) keV corresponding to\nthe decay of the first 2+ excited state. The measured\nenergy is slightly different from the energy of 1824(12)\nkeV reported in [30] using a scintillator array. We obtain\nan inclusive cross section of \u03c3 = 0.48(6) mb for the two-\nneutron knockout and a 0.07(4) mb cross section to the\nfirst 2+ excited state. Assuming no other bound excited\nstates, the ground state is fed directly with a cross section\nof 0.41(7) mb.\nFor 28S (Sp = 2.46(3) MeV), a new transition has been\n(a)\n(b)\nFIG. 5: Level schemes of 28S (a) and 24Si (b). The experimen-\ntal results (center) are compared to shell-model predictions\nand to the level scheme of the respective mirror nucleus.\nobserved at 1512(8) keV. This transition is assigned to\nthe decay of the first 2+ state of 28S, based on shell-model\ncalculations and comparison to the mirror nucleus. A\nshell-model calculation with the Oxbash code [31] and\nthe USD interaction [32] predicts the first 2+ state at\n1543 keV excitation energy, while that of the mirror nu-\ncleus, 28Mg, is at 1473 keV (see Fig. 5(a)). The inclu-\nsive cross section for the production of 28S from 30S is\n\u03c3 = 0.73(8) mb. The 2+ excited state is populated with\na 0.34(8) mb cross section leaving a 0.39(8) mb cross sec-\ntion for the knockout to the ground state.\nOf the three nuclei studied, 24Si is the most strongly\nbound with a proton separation energy of Sp = 3.3(4)\nMeV. Two \u03b3-ray transitions are observed, at 1550(12)\nkeV and 1860(10) keV, the latter being about twice as\nintense as the former. The observed transitions corre-\nspond to the decay of the two previously reported ex-\ncited states of 24Si at 3441(10) keV and 1879(11) keV\n[33], respectively. The statistics are too low to allow a \u03b3-\n\u03b3 coincidence study of these two transitions. The mirror\nnucleus 24Ne exhibits a vibrator-like excitation scheme\nwith a first 2+ state lying at 1981.6(4) keV and a (2+,4+)\ndoublet at 3867(8) keV and 3962(18) keV [34], respec-\ntively. Each state of the doublet decays with an almost\n100% branch to the first excited state. A comparison\nwith 24Ne suggests that the two lines observed for 24Si\nin the present work are in coincidence with the first 2+\nstate at 1860(10) keV and a (2,4)+ level at 3410(16) keV.\nThe resulting level scheme is shown in Fig. 5 (for a dis-\ncussion on mirror asymmetry in these nuclei see [35]).\n4TABLE I: Spin, excitation energy of the final states, and ex-\nperimental cross sections for the two-neutron knockout reac-\ntions 9Be(34Ar,32Ar)X, 9Be(30S,28S)X and 9Be(26Si,24Si)X.\nThe results are compared to the theoretical cross sections\nwhich are broken down according to contributions from\nstripping, stripping-diffraction and diffraction. For com-\nparison, the inclusive cross sections from the two-proton\nknockout reactions 9Be(34Si,32Mg)X, 9Be(30Mg,28Ne)X and\n9Be(28Mg,26Ne)X [22] are also presented.\nProj.

For comparison, we also include the inclusive cross\nsections for the two-proton removal reactions reported in\n[22]. The different reactions show cross sections of the or-\nder of 1 mb for two-proton (two-neutron) knockout from\nneutron-rich (neutron-deficient) nuclei in the sd-shell.\nOur theoretical calculations of the two-neutron-\nremoval cross sections follow the formalism and notation\nof Ref. [24], which developed a full treatment of the two-\nnucleon stripping (absorption) cross section, \u03c3str . Here,\nwe also include a full calculation of contributons to the\ncross sections from events where only one of the nucle-\nons is stripped (absorbed) and the second is removed by\nan elastic collision (diffraction of the nucleons or residue)\nwith the target. This is denoted \u03c3str\u2212diff . We only esti-\nmate the small cross section, \u03c3diff , from events in which\nboth of the tightly-bound nucleons are removed by elastic\ndissociation.\nThe two knocked-out nucleons are assumed to be re-\nmoved from a set of active and partially occupied single-\nparticle orbitals \u03c6j , with spherical quantum numbers\nn(\u2113j)m. The assumed two-nucleon overlap function, of\nthe initial state J with each residue final state f , is\ndenoted by \u03a8\n(f)\nJM [24]. In the eikonal model of the di-\nrect reaction dynamics, the (A-2)-body residue (or core)\nis a spectator and is assumed to interact at most elas-\ntically with the target. It thus enters the formalism\nthrough a residue-target elastic transmission probabil-\nity |Sc|\n2. Events in which a nucleon is absorbed are\ndescribed by the nucleon-target absorption probabilities\n[1 \u2212 |Si|\n2]. The S and \u03c6j are calculated as discussed in\nRef. [14], being constrained by Hartree-Fock systematics.\nContributions to the two-nucleon knockout cross sec-\ntion from the diffractive removal of one nucleon, say 1,\nand absorption of the second, 2, are included in the ex-\npression\n\u03c31 =\n1\n2J + 1\n\u2211\nM\n\u222b\nd~b\u3008\u03a8\n(f)\nJM ||Sc|\n2|S1|\n2[1\u2212 |S2|\n2]|\u03a8\n(f)\nJM \u3009,\n(1)\nand similarly for diffraction of nucleon 2. However, as\ncurrently stated, Eq. (1) includes events in which nucleon\n1 remains bound to the residue. These single-nucleon\nremoval events, populating bound (A-1)-body residues,\nmust be removed by projecting off the nucleon-residue\nbound states, by replacing in Eq. (1)\n|S1|\n2 \u2192 S\u22171 [1\u2212\n\u2211\nj\u2032\u2032m\u2032\u2032\n|\u03c6m\n\u2032\u2032\nj\u2032\u2032 )(\u03c6\nm\u2032\u2032\nj\u2032\u2032 | ]S1 .

We include all the active single particle or-\nbitals in this sum. After having made this replacement\nthen \u03c3str\u2212diff=\u03c31+\u03c32.\nWe only estimate the cross section from removal of\nboth tightly-bound nucleons by elastic dissociation. We\nmake use of the reduction in the removal cross section\nwhen one nucleon is dissociated rather than stripped, i.e.\n\u03c3i\/\u03c3str as calculated above. We thus estimate the two-\nnucleon diffractive cross section to be \u03c3diff\u2248[\u03c3i\/\u03c3str]\n2\u03c3str.\nSince, see Table I, \u03c3i\/\u03c3str \u2248 0.35\u2212 0.4, we estimate that\n\u03c3diff makes a contribution of only 6 \u2212 8% to the two-\nnucleon removal partial cross sections. Finally, the theo-\nretical cross sections are the sum \u03c3th = \u03c3str + \u03c3str\u2212diff +\n\u03c3diff . For all of the three systems studied these \u03c3th over-\npredict the measured cross sections by about a factor\nof two, requiring an empirical suppression of the two-\nneutron shell model strengths. This reduction - some-\nwhat analogous to the suppressions observed in single-\nnucleon removal reactions - will be discussed elsewhere\n[36].\nThe observed differences in the cross sections to in-\ndividual final states suggests (i) significant sensitivity\nof the reaction to the single-particle structures of the\nprojectiles and residues, and thus (ii) that the direct\ntwo-nucleon removal mechanism provides opportunities\nto probe aspects of nuclear structure far from stability.\nFigure 6 shows the ground-state transition branching ra-\ntios, B0 = \u03c3(0\n+)\/\u03c3incl, of the three two-neutron removal\nreactions. The measured B0 are compared to two model\n50.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\nexperiment\ncorrelated 2n\nuncorrelated 2n\nB0\n34Ar 26Si30S\nFIG. 6: Ground state branching ratios B0 = \u03c3(0\n+)\/\u03c3incl in\nthe two-neutron removal reactions from 26Si, 30S and 34Ar\nfrom (i) the experiment, (ii) calculated assuming the removal\nof two uncorrelated neutrons, and (iii) when including corre-\nlations via the many-body shell model wave functions [24, 36].\ncalculations. The first assumes the knockout of two com-\npletely uncorrelated neutrons from pure configurations\n\u03bd[d5\/2]\n4, B0=4\/9, \u03bd[d5\/2]\n6, B0=1\/6, and \u03bd[d5\/2]\n6[s1\/2]\n2,\nB0\u22481\/6, for\n26Si, 30S and 34Ar, respectively (see e.g.\nSection III of [24]). The second calculation includes fully\nthe pairing correlations between the neutrons as given\nby the many-body, sd-shell model wave functions [24, 36].\nThe experimental branching ratios are in agreement with\nthe model for removal of two correlated neutrons while\nthe uncorrelated neutrons assumption fails to reproduce\nthe data. Specifically, these direct two-neutron knockout\nreactions show sensitivity to, and insight into the pair-\ncorrelations of the two neutrons, leading to an enhanced\n0+ cross section. Unlike one-nucleon knockout reactions,\nhere the two-particle shell-model components contribute\ncoherently for a given total angular momentum, result-\ning in interference effects. This strong interplay between\nnuclear structure and the reaction dynamics is evident in\nthe results in Table I and Fig. 6.\nIn summary, two-neutron knockout reaction measure-\nments have been performed on the already neutron-\ndeficient nuclei 34Ar, 30S, and 26Si, near the proton\ndripline. Particle-\u03b3 coincidences allowed the measure-\nment of the partial cross sections to individual bound\nfinal states. Level schemes of the residues are proposed\nusing comparisons with the mirror nuclei and with USD\nshell-model calculations. The inclusive two-neutron re-\nmoval cross sections from these proton-rich nuclei with\nN = 12, 14, 16 were found to be of the order of 1 mb; simi-\nlar to those observed in two-proton knockout experiments\nfrom the neutron-rich sd-shell nuclei with Z = 12, 14\n[22]. Based on the energetics of the reaction and the ob-\nserved cross sections, the two-neutron removal processes\ndiscussed here appear to proceed by the direct reaction\nmechanism.\nThis work was supported by the U.S. National Science\nFoundation under Grants No. PHY-0110253 and No.\nPHY-0244453 and by the United Kingdom Engineering\nand Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Grant\nNo. EP\/D003628.\n\u2217 Present address: RIKEN, Hirosawa 2-1, Wako, Saitama\n351-0198, Japan\n\u2020 Present address: American Science & Engineering, Inc.,\n829 Middlesex Turnpike, Billerica, MA 01821, USA\n\u2021 Present address: Laboratoire de Physique Corpusculaire,\n6 Boulevard du mare\u00b4chal Juin, 14050 Caen Cedex, France\n[1] P.
