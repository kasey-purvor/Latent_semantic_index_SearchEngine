Using transcranial \nmagnetic stimulation (TMS), this study first established the specialisation of each area \nin the form of a double dissociation; TMS to right PPC disrupted processing of a \ncolour\/form conjunction and TMS to V5 disrupted processing of a motion\/form \nconjunction. The key finding of this study is however, if TMS is used to disrupt \nprocessing of V5 at its critical time of activation during the motion\/form conjunction \ntask, concurrent disruption of right PPC now has a significant effect, where TMS at \nPPC alone does not. Our findings challenge the conventional interpretation of the role \nof right PPC in conjunction search and spatial attention.  \n \nKeywords: attention; conjunction search; motion processing; posterior parietal \ncortex; TMS; V5.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 2\nIntroduction \nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been successfully used to identify areas \nin the brain which are critical for given behavioural tasks. However, most behavioural \ntasks involve not just one brain area but a whole network of them, each area with its \nown functionality in the processing of the task. Functional imaging has helped us to \nidentify the networks of relevant areas, but does not determine how they interact.  \n \nIn our study, we employ a dual-site TMS approach to study the interaction of two \nareas which have both been implicated in different aspects of visual search. In recent \nyears, the visual search task has been used as a tool to answer questions about neural \nprocessing in the human brain. Taken together, various neuropsychological, \nneuroimaging and TMS studies seem to suggest that PPC is involved in spatial search \nfor conjunction items irrespective of search difficulty (Friedman-Hill, 1995, Corbetta \n& Shulman, 1998; Shafritz et al., 2002; Nobre et al., 2003; Ellison et al., 2003). It is \nalso known that V5 has a vital role to play in the processing of visual search tasks in \nwhich attention to motion is required (McLeod et al, 1989; Walsh et al., 1998).  \n \nThe exact contribution of V5 to motion processing in these tasks may lie in its known \nproperties as a motion filter (McLeod et al., 1989, 1991). While the perception of \nmovement per se and the identification of the movement direction of individual \nobjects does not require V5 (Andersen et al., 1990), V5 is critically involved in the \nintegration of movement across multiple visual items (e.g. Newsome & Par\u00e9, 1988). \nThe role of V5 for this so-called global motion perception has been demonstrated \nusing single-unit recordings (Born & Tootell, 1992), lesion studies in monkeys \n(Newsome & Par\u00e9, 1988) and humans (Baker et al., 1991; Schenk & Zihl, 1997), \n 3\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation (Beckers & Homberg, 1992) and functional imaging \n(Culham et al., 2001). V5 is required to group objects of similar motion properties \ntogether which conversely allows the segregation of groups of objects with different \nmotion properties. This is for example illustrated by its involvement in form-from-\nmotion tasks (Rizzo et al., 1995). In a motion\/orientation conjunction search task, V5 \ncan help to separate the moving items and the non-moving items into different groups, \nso that the subsequent search can be focussed on the moving items. Consequently, \nwithin the group of moving items the target is clearly identified by its unique \norientation, making the search for the target significantly easier. This scenario is \nsupported by the fact that the search rate for motion\/orientation conjunction is smaller \nthan that for other types of conjunction tasks (e.g. McLeod et al., 1989). Selective \ndisruption of V5 will still allow the detection of motion, since many other areas in the \nvisual cortex respond to visual motion as well, but it will impair the grouping of \nobjects with shared motion properties, and therefore make the search for targets which \nare defined by a combination of motion and form more difficult. This was in fact \nconfirmed by a study with the V5-lesioned patient LM. In contrast to healthy subjects \nLM\u2019s search for a motion-conjunction target was not more efficient than that for other \nconjunction targets (McLeod et al., 1989).  \n \nThe first question of the current study is concerned with establishing whether it is \nonly V5 which is vital for such a motion\/orientation task or whether PPC (which is \naccepted to be involved in conjunction search) is also required. However, a more \nimportant question relates to how the brain responds to the disruption of V5. Given \nthat in this case, the motion filter can no longer be used to isolate moving items into a \ncoherent group of common fate, the task should now be treated as a normal \n 4\nconjunction search, and PPC may again become important for its processing. This \nwould be reflected by an increase in reaction time when both V5 and PPC are \nstimulated which is in addition to the increase observed for V5 stimulation alone or \nfor stimulation of V5 in combination with a control site (such as vertex). \n \n \n \nMaterials and Methods \n \nSubjects \nSeven healthy subjects, aged 18-31, with normal or corrected to normal vision (all \nright handed; five female, two male), participated in all tasks. Subjects gave their \nsigned informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with the \napproval of Durham University Ethics Advisory Committee, and could leave the \nexperiment at any point. Subject selection complied with current guidelines for \nrepetitive TMS research (Wassermann 1998). \n \nStimuli \nAll stimuli were presented on a 320mm x 240mm monitor driven by a Pentium-4 PC \nprogrammed in E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Inc). Subjects were seated \ncomfortably 57.5 cm away from the screen with the centre of the screen at pupil level. \nThe subjects\u2019 head and trunk sagittal midline was aligned with the centre of the \nscreen, and head position was controlled by a chinrest. Except for the light from the \nPC screen the room was darkened. \n \n 5\nVisual Search Tasks \nTwo visual search tasks were used (see Figure 1). In both tasks, all items subtended 1\u00b0 \nx 1\u00b0 visual angle and were presented against a black background. Subjects were asked \nto respond as quickly and as accurately as possible on a button box (left button for \ntarget-present, right button for target-absent) to indicate the presence or absence of the \ntarget. Each trial was preceded by a central fixation cross (0.5\u00b0 x 0.5\u00b0) for 500ms \nfollowed immediately by the stimulus array. There were 8 distractor items in each \narray, 4 of each distractor set. In trials where the target was absent, an extra distractor \nwas displayed to eliminate counting as a strategy. The target was present in 50% of \ntrials, and there was never more than one target. The visual array remained present \nuntil response or for 2000ms, whichever was shorter, and the inter-trial interval was \n4000ms. \n \nThe colour\/orientation conjunction task required search for a red slash (\/) target \namongst red backslashes (\\) and green slashes. In the motion\/orientation conjunction \ntask the target was a moving red slash with moving red backslashes and stationary red \nslashes as distractors. Movement was constant at 21\u00ba s-1 and moving items were \nallowed to scroll from the bottom to the top of the screen. The movement of items was \nnever impeded by stationary objects (see Figure 1). \n \nFigure 1 about here please. \n \nTMS \nA Magstim\u2122 Model 200 was used to apply 5 pulses 100ms from visual stimulus \nonset (10Hz) at 65% of the stimulator\u2019s maximum power (i.e. 1.3 Tesla). A \n 6\nMagstim\u2122 BiPulse machine was also used to apply double pulses of TMS at 65% of \nthe stimulator\u2019s maximum power 50ms apart. This intensity of stimulation was chosen \nas it is super-threshold to both areas of cortex investigated (see Stewart et al. 2001, for \ndetails). \n \nTwo sites of stimulation were used right posterior parietal cortex, PPC and the visual \nmotion area V5. The PPC site was identified by using a hunting procedure with the \nhard conjunction task, as described in Ashbridge et al. (1997) and employed by \nEllison et al., (2003). In the hunting procedure, 10 trials of TMS are given to each site \nin a 3 x 3 grid around a central point 9 cm dorsal to the mastoid-inion and 6cm lateral. \nThe \u201chotspot\u201d for activation is denoted by a 100ms increase in reaction time over the \ntrials in which no TMS was administered. This functionally localised position was \nthen verified using BrainSight\u2122 (Rogue Research, Montreal, Canada) (see Figure 2). \nA 70mm figure-of-eight coil place tangential to the skull with the handle of the coil \nparallel to the mid-sagittal plane pointing in anterior direction was used to stimulate \nright PPC. This was done to accommodate a second coil positioned at right V5 in the \ndual-site experiment but this orientation was used throughout all experiments.  \n \nFigure 2 about here please \n \nRight V5 (generally corresponding to 3cm above the mastoid-inion and 5cm lateral to \nthe right) was found by localising the area where a train of 5 TMS pulses (10Hz) \nelicited the strongest and most salient moving phosphenes (see Schenk et al., 2005) at \nthe lowest TMS intensity. This was further localised using the hunting procedure (the \ncentral point being that which elicited the strongest moving phosphenes) with the \n 7\nmotion\/orientation conjunction task. Using BrainSight\u2122, this was verified to be at the \nwidely accepted anatomical location for V5 (see Figure 2). A 50mm figure-of-eight \ncoil placed tangential to the skull was used to stimulate this more focal area of cortex. \nThe smaller coil was also used at this site to allow space on the skull for two coils. As \nthe small coil is in the form of a branding iron, the handle direction is perpendicular to \nthe skull. In all subjects however, the coil windings were positioned such that current \nflowed in an anterior-posterior direction. The same coil orientation was used \nthroughout the experiments. When both coils were used concurrently, the foci of \nstimulation were on average 6cm apart on the skull. \n \nExperiment 1 \nThe purpose of this experiment was to determine the search rate for the two visual \nsearch tasks. Subjects were asked to complete 60 trials without TMS in which the \nnumber of distractors, and thus the set-size was varied (4, 8, 16). This was done for \nboth the colour\/orientation and motion\/orientation conjunction tasks. The search rate, \ni.e. the slope of the search function was calculated by using the conventional formula \nfor computing the slope of a linear function, namely (x2-x1)\/(y2-y1). \n \nExperiment 2  \nThe purpose of this experiment was to determine the involvement of the right PPC \nand the right V5 in the two visual search tasks using rTMS. Subjects were stimulated \nat either the right PPC or V5 site for four blocks of 24 moving\/form conjunction trials \nand four blocks of 24 colour\/form conjunction trials. TMS stimulation started at the \nonset of the presentation of the search array. In Experiment 2 (and in all following \nexperiments) the set-size was limited to 8 items. A sham stimulation was used in four \n 8\nblocks in each task. In the sham condition a non-discharging coil was placed over the \narea of interest while a discharging coil was placed in close proximity to the subject. \nThe subjective experience of the noise associated with a TMS pulse was therefore the \nsame as was the tactile experience of a coil placed on the head, however no pulse was \nadministered into the brain. Half of the subjects experienced the V5-stimulation \nduring the first session, and the PPC-stimulation during the second session. This order \nwas reversed for the other half of the subjects. In both sessions sham-stimulation was \nintermingled with the V5 or PPC stimulation. In session two, the same blocks of trials \nwere completed with stimulation occurring at the other site of interest. \n \nSessions one and two therefore had 16 blocks each in which block and site order were \nrandomised across subjects to minimise either order or practice effects. \n \nExperiment 3 \nThis experiment was necessary to determine the correct parameters for Experiment 4. \nIn Experiment 4 (see below) we wanted to examine the effect of combining TMS over \nV5 and PPC. Since our equipment only allowed us to combine dual pulse TMS over \none site with rTMS at a different site, we first needed to establish the best time period \nfor delivering a double-pulse over V5 (dTMS, two pulses 50 ms apart). To do this we \nexamined search performance in the motion\/orientation task using five different time \nintervals during which dTMS (0\/50, 50\/100, 100\/150, 150\/200, 200\/250 ms after the \nonset of the search array) was delivered, and selected those intervals which resulted in \na significant increase in search time. TMS was applied in 6 blocks of 40 trials \ninterspersed by 6 blocks of 40 trials with sham TMS to control for practice effects. \n 9\nThis provided data from 48 trials in each TMS time bin. Again, block order was \nrandomised across subjects. \n \nExperiment 4 \nThe purpose of this last experiment was to examine the effect of a combined \nstimulation of both V5 and PPC on search performance in a motion\/orientation task. \nIn session four, TMS was applied over V5 at three different time intervals measured \nfrom the onset of the presentation of the search array, namely 100+150, 150+200, \n200+250. This selection of time-intervals was based on the results from Experiment 3. \nOnly intervals during which V5-stimulation on its own yielded a significant \nperformance disruption in the motion\/orientation task were included. In addition a \npulse train of 10Hz for 500ms was applied to right PPC at the onset of the search \narray for 6 blocks of 24 trials. These blocks were interspersed with three blocks of 24 \ntrials in which V5-stimulation was combined with vertex stimulation (anatomical \ncentre of the skull) and three blocks of 24 trials with sham-TMS. For the V5 \nstimulation we used the same parameters as before (i.e. double-pulse at three time \nintervals). For the vertex stimulation we used the same stimulation parameters as for \nPPC.  \n \nIn total each subject participated in four 1.5 hour testing sessions. Sessions were each \none week apart.  \n \nStatistical Analysis \nMean reaction times were compared using repeated measures general linear models to \ntest for TMS effects. The normalised TMS effect was also computed for each subject \n 10\nby using the following formula: (TMS reaction time \u2013 sham TMS reaction time) \/ \nsham TMS reaction time x 100. These effects were compared using repeated measures \ngeneral linear models. Significant results were further investigated using pair-wise \npost-hoc tests with corrections for multiple comparisons. In experiment 4, TMS \neffects for each time interval of stimulation were investigated using two-tailed one \nsample t-tests with corrections for multiple comparisons. \n \n \n \nResults \nIn all experiments, error rates were less than 4% and for clarity, only reaction times \nfor target-present responses were analysed. \n \nExperiment 1: The search functions and search rates for both search tasks are \npresented in Figure 3a. For both tasks a serial search function was obtained, however \nthe motion\/orientation conjunction search was more efficient than the \ncolour\/orientation conjunction. (i.e. search rate for colour\/orientation task: 35.86 ms \nper item [sd: 7.22 ms\/item]; search rate for motion\/orientation: 21.72 ms per item [sd: \n5.11 ms\/item]).  \n \nExperiment 2:  In this experiment we examined the effect of rTMS either over PPC or \nV5 on performance in both search tasks. The results are presented in Figure 3b. A \nthree factor (site [PPC v V5] x task [colour\/form conjunction v motion\/form \nconjunction] x TMS [TMS v sham TMS] repeated measures general liner model \n(GLM) revealed a significant main effect for TMS (F(1, 6) = 10.586, p = 0.017) and a \n 11\nsignificant interaction between site, task and TMS (F(1, 6) = 31.806, p = 0.001). A two \nfactor (task x site) repeated measures GLM carried out on the normalised TMS effect \nat each site for each task revealed a significant interaction between task and site (F(1, 6) \n= 30.936, p = 0.001). Post-hoc Bonferroni tests show that the source of these \ninteractions lies in the significant effect of TMS over right PPC in the \ncolour\/orientation conjunction task (t = -3.435, df = 6, p = 0.014) but not the \nmotion\/orientation task (t = -1.204, df = 6, p = 0.274), and the significant effect of \nTMS over V5 in the motion\/orientation conjunction task (t = -5.538, df = 6, p = 0.001) \nbut not the colour\/orientation conjunction task (t = -0.261, df = 6, p = 0.803) (see \nFigure 3b). There was no significant difference between the TMS effect seen at right \nPPC for the colour\/orientation conjunction and V5 for the motion\/orientation \nconjunction task. In a separate analysis we examined whether there were differences \nin the TMS effect between the right and left visual hemispace for the two search tasks. \nHowever, we did not find significant hemispace differences for either V5 or for PPC \n(see Table 1).  \n \nFigure 3 and Table 1 about here please. \n \nExperiment 3:  In this experiment we identified the critical time period for delivering \na dTMS pulse over V5. Two-tailed one sample t-tests (alpha level corrected for \nmultiple comparisons = 0.01) on the normalised TMS effect at each time bin \n(comparison value: 0) showed that TMS had a significant effect at the 100\/150 ms (t = \n6.474, df = 6, p = 0.001), 150\/200 ms (t = 4.094, df = 6, p = 0.006) and 200\/250 ms (t \n= 6.374, df = 6, p = 0.001) onset asynchronies. Therefore we used these three onset \nasynchronies in Experiment 4. The results are presented in Figure 4.  \n 12\n Figure 4 about here please.  \n \nExperiment 4: In this experiment the combined effect of V5 and PPC stimulation on \nsearch performance in the motion\/orientation task was examined. Reaction times from \neach of the three time periods used in V5\/MT TMS were not significantly different \nfrom each other and so were pooled in the analysis of Experiment 4. When a 5 pulse \ntrain (10Hz) of TMS was applied to right PPC while V5 was disrupted at the critical \ntimes found in Experiment 1, reaction times were significantly slower than when V5 \nwas stimulated alone or when a pulse train was delivered to vertex concurrently with \ndouble pulses to V5 (see Figure 5).  \n \n \nFigure 5 about here please. \n \nA one factor (site [V5, V5 + vertex, V5 + PPC]) repeated measures GLM revealed a \nsignificant main effect of TMS across sites (F(2, 40) = 12.589, p = 0.000). \nPost-hoc Bonferroni tests show that there was a significant increase in reaction time \nwhen right PPC was stimulated with V5 over that seen when V5 is stimulated alone (t \n= -4.695, df = 20, p = 0.000). There was also a significant difference between reaction \ntimes when PPC was stimulated with V5 and when vertex was stimulated with V5 (t = \n-3.080, df = 20, p = 0.006) indicating that this effect is not one mediated by a general \nfactor such as dual-site stimulation. To corroborate this point, there was no significant \ndifference between reaction times when V5 was stimulated with vertex and when V5 \nwas stimulated alone (t = -1.205, df = 20, p = 0.242). A separate paired sample t-test \n 13\nwas carried out to demonstrate a significant difference between the effect of TMS at \nV5+PPC and that seen when PPC was stimulated alone (t = 3.331, df = 6, p = 0.016). \nAgain, we examined whether the TMS effect was different for the right versus the left \nvisual hemispace. However, we did not find significant hemispace differences for any \nof the stimulation conditions. (see Table 1). \n \n 14\nDiscussion \nWe tested the interaction of areas V5 and PPC in a visual search task by using dual-\nsite TMS stimulation. It is well known that both areas are involved in visual search \ntasks. It is however not known whether and how they may interact during a task in \nwhich each may be theoretically involved. Using a motion\/orientation conjunction \nsearch, we found evidence of an interaction between the two areas. V5 disruption \nappears to act as a gate for PPC involvement, i.e. PPC stimulation affects search \nperformance in a motion\/orientation task only when it is applied in combination with \nV5-stimulation. Importantly, this gating effect seems to be specific to V5, if \nstimulation of PPC is combined with stimulation of vertex, no significant TMS effect \nis observed. In the following we will discuss possible explanations for this interaction \nand explore the implications of these findings for our understanding of the role of \nPPC in visual search tasks and in the control of spatial attention.  \n \nOne explanation for this interaction can be derived from the motion-filter hypothesis \nwhich we described in the Introduction. According to this hypothesis V5 acts as a \nmotion-filter, it allows for the grouping of all moving stimuli and thereby facilitates \nthe segregation of moving from stationary stimuli. Once this separation is achieved, \nthe search can be restricted to the group of moving stimuli. Within that group the \ntarget is clearly defined on the basis of a single feature, in our case its orientation. The \nmotion-filter transforms a motion\/orientation conjunction search into a simpler \norientation search as indicated by the flatter search function. It is thus expected that \nwhile the motion-filter is intact, feature-binding is not required. PPC which is \nprimarily concerned with feature-binding will, therefore, not be involved. However, \nonce the motion-filter is impaired, moving and stationary stimuli are no longer \n 15\nseparated, the target has to be searched among both the stationary and the moving \nstimuli and that its detection requires the identification of two features (i.e. orientation \nand motion). This requires feature-binding, and therefore also involves the PPC. This \nexplanation fits very well with our own findings but also with previous findings \nrelating to the functional role of PPC and V5. Firstly, we have shown that in the \nabsence of V5-stimulation (i.e., while the putative motion-filter is intact) PPC is not \ninvolved in motion\/orientation search. Secondly, we found that when V5 is disrupted, \na significant PPC-stimulation effect is observed, suggesting that PPC now becomes \ncrucially involved in the motion\/orientation search task. However, it also fits with \nprevious characterization of PPC as an area crucially involved in feature-binding (e.g. \nAshbridge et al., 1997; Ellison et al., 2003, 2004) and with previous findings showing \nthat V5-disruption does not abolish the perception of motion, but selectively impairs \nthe grouping of moving stimuli and the perception of motion coherence (e.g. Beckers \n& Homberg, 1992, Cowey et al., 2006).  \n \nHowever, this is not the only possible explanation for the observed interaction \nbetween V5 and PPC stimulation. It is also possible that cross-hemispheric effects of \nthe unilateral stimulation account for the increased response delay which we observed \nwhen we combined V5 and PPC stimulation. In this context it is important to note that \nour TMS stimulation was restricted to the right hemisphere. However, this does not \nnecessarily mean that the effects of this stimulation were restricted to just this \nhemisphere. In fact we know from clinical (Corbetta et al., 2005) but also rTMS \nstudies that disruption of an area in one hemisphere can lead to changes in the activity \nof homologue areas in the other hemisphere (Bonato et al., 2006; Komssi et al., \n2002). Moreover, in the case of neglect, it was demonstrated that TMS stimulation of \n 16\nthe \u201cunaffected\u201d hemisphere can alleviate the symptoms caused by the real or virtual \nlesion in the opposite hemisphere (Hilgetag et al., 2001; Brighina et al., 2003). One \nmight therefore suggest that the reason why the effect of PPC stimulation is more \npronounced when V5 is stimulated at the same time is not that the areas are \nfunctionally interlinked, but that their combined stimulation exerts a more potent \neffect on the activity of contralateral PPC. This would suggest that stimulation over \nright-hemispheric V5 somehow adds to the effect that stimulation of right-\nhemispheric PPC has on the activity of left-hemispheric PPC. This assumption is \nproblematic given that cross-hemispheric effects have been primarily demonstrated \nbetween homologue areas (e.g. Bonato et al., 2006; Komssi et al., 2002). It is also \nimportant to note that the technique used to induce cross-hemispheric effects was 1Hz \nlong-term rTMS. It is currently unclear whether the methods used in our study, \nnamely 10 Hz short-term rTMS, yields similar functional effects. In summary, while \nthe possibility of cross-hemispheric effects cannot be excluded, the motion-filter \nhypothesis seems to provide a better fit to the available data.  \n \nOur findings also have implication with regards to the role of PPC in visual search. It \nhas long been assumed that PPC is primarily involved in the feature-binding aspect. In \nline with Treisman\u2019s classical distinction between conjunction and feature search, it is \ntherefore expected that PPC is involved in conjunction but not in feature search \n(Friedman-Hill, 1995, Corbetta & Shulman, 1998; Shafritz et al., 2002; Nobre et al., \n2003). This was in fact confirmed in rTMS studies (Ashbridge et al., 1997; Ellison et \nal., 2003), however, our current findings suggest that there are exceptions. In the case \nof the motion\/orientation task no effect of PPC-stimulation was found. Does this mean \nthat PPC is not involved in feature-binding? We think that PPC is involved in feature-\n 17\nbinding, but our conjunction task does not require the binding of features. There are \ntwo possible reasons why a motion\/orientation conjunction tasks does not invoke PPC \nconjunction processing. The first explanation relates to the motion-filter hypothesis \nwhich was described above and suggests that the motion-filter effectively turns the \nconjunction search into a feature search. The second explanation relates to the \nphysiology of cells in V5. These cells combine orientation and motion-selectivity \n(Van Essen, 1985). This means that the two features which are relevant for the search \nare already combined at the level of the individual neuron and, therefore, additional \nfeature-binding is not required. Currently it is not possible to decide between these \ntwo explanations.  \n \nThese results also have ramifications for the role of spatial attention in visual search \ntasks. It is commonly assumed that serial search rates indicate that the task requires \nspatial attention (Treisman & Gelade, 1980; Woodman & Luck, 2003; Nobre et al., \n2003). Moreover, it is also accepted that the right PPC is critical for the deployment of \nspatial attention (Corbetta & Shulman, 1998; Nobre et al., 2003; Ashbridge et al., \n1997; Ellison et al., 2004). However, our findings are at odds with these two \nassumptions. The motion\/orientation task used in our study yielded a serial search \nfunction, but it appeared that PPC was not critically involved in this task. This \nsuggests that at least one of the two assumptions is incorrect: either serial search \nfunctions do not necessarily indicate the involvement of spatial attention, or the \neffective control of spatial attention does not critically depend on PPC.  \n \nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that if the interaction of different visual areas is \ntaken into account, some of the well-established associations between aspects of \n 18\nvisual search and their underlying neural mechanisms are challenged. For example \nour results suggest that conjunction search does not always require feature-binding, \nand therefore does not always involve the PPC. They also suggest that if serial search \nis taken as an indicator of the involvement of spatial attention, PPC is not always \ninvolved when spatial attention is required. This study illustrates how dual-site TMS \ncan go beyond the identification of crucial brain areas and help to uncover the \ninteraction and the specific roles of different areas within a functional network. \n \nAcknowledgements. \nARL was supported by an ESRC-MRC studentship. \n \n \nReferences  \nAndersen RA, Snowden RJ, Treue S, Graziano M. 1990.
