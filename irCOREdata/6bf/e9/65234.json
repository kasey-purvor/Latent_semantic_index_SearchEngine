The feminist political critique which encouraged agency \namongst young women has been replaced by equal opportunities policies and problem-\nbased interventions. It is possible that, like the girls club organisations of the late \nnineteenth and early twentieth centuries, whose history was overwritten by the move \ntowards mixed sex work, so too the history of the feminist youth work movement will be \nobscured by contemporary organisational and policy concerns. The documentary \nevidence of feminist youth work is now scattered but the analysis in this article is \ninformed by the evidence in a small archive, and by empirical research with women \nyouth workers undertaken in North East England in 1988 and 1993. It is also shaped by \nthe author\u201fs recollections of personal engagement with feminist youth work practice. The \narticle documents how efforts to enhance the agency of working class young women and \nthe autonomy of female youth workers were co-opted and destroyed in the drive towards \ncentralised managerial control characteristic of public sector conditions after the election \nof the Conservative government in 1979 which became manifest in an fracturing of \nfeminist collaboration.       \n 2 \n  \n \n \nThe Development and Decline of Feminism in British Youth Work, 1975 -1990.   \n \nIntroduction \nDuring the 1970s an explicitly feminist movement for working with girls and young \nwomen emerged within British youth services, challenging masculine domination of \ninformal youth provision across the voluntary and statutory sectors. For a decade the \nmovement gathered pace, supported between 1978 and 1987 by a Girls\u201f Work Unit \nestablished at the National Association of Youth Clubs (NAYC) headquarters in \nLeicester.  Using a potent combination of feminist theory, personal identification and \nsingle sex organisation feminist workers questioned the masculine connotations of \n\u201cyouth,\u201d disputed the perception that feminism was relevant only to middle class women, \nand made connections with other structured inequalities, particularly of sexuality, race, \ndisability and age.   \n \nYouth work was always a small, under-resourced profession, but the impact of \nfeminist youth work resonated beyond its boundaries. In highlighting issues such as the \nsexual abuse of children and the marginalisation of young mothers, it raised questions \nrelevant to and later picked up by other human services and by policy-makers. However, \nwhen such issues were adopted outside youth work, the feminist discourse was \ngenerally displaced by a depoliticised \u201cprofessional\u201d language such as that of \u201canti-\noppressive practice\u201d adopted in social work.1 In the process, the agency accorded to \nyoung people, crucial to feminist youth work, was diminished. With the ascendance of \nneo-liberalism in British politics, youth work with girls was itself to become more aligned \nwith the perspectives of other professions through the targeting of policy and funding \ncriteria in these areas. \n \nThe election of successive Conservative governments after 1979 precipitated a \nserious loss of resource for youth work which, as a service with no legislative base, was \nalready poorly funded.2  As youth work became more defensive, so its political \ndiscourses were increasingly repressed. Eventually, even the word \u201cfeminism\u201d became \nunutterable, consigned to personal belief rather to public, professional knowledge and \n 3 \nunderstanding: \u201cYou can\u201ft have an image as a radical or feminist organisation because \nof the risk you run of challenging people in power. You have to keep those beliefs to \nyourself and do it in ways that it\u201fs not so obvious.\u201d3 At the same time, the deconstruction \nof \u201cinefficient\u201d industry impacted disproportionately upon working class young people. As \nfeminist youth workers argued, unemployment was highest amongst girls but special \ninitiatives prioritised unemployed boys with reference to traditional gender roles. 4  \nFunding for youth work was further skewed towards control and away from agency with \nreference to the underclass theories of Charles Murray, which stressed problems of \ncrime with reference to unemployed young men, and young motherhood with reference \nto working class young women. 5  \n \nBudgetary cuts, targeted funding and increased managerial control closed down \nmost of the ambiguous spaces in which feminist youth work had been able to progress. \nEven the equal opportunities agenda which had seemed conducive to feminist intentions \nwas subjected to changed priorities, shifting from an informal process-orientated \napproach concerned with different practice \u201cissues\u201d to one concerned with formal \nequality in organisational systems and structures.6 This encouraged greater professional \nformality within feminist youth work, undermining its personal-political value base, and at \nthe same time it challenged the assumption of \u201csisterhood\u201d between feminists as \ndifferent identities led to different organisational alliances.   \n \nBy the end of the 1980s, feminist youth work was struggling to survive. In 1987, \nthe Girls Work Unit was closed and in its wake most of the women youth workers\u201f \ngroups which feminist workers had relied on for support and collective organisation \ncollapsed. Meanwhile, work with young mothers had become central to continued \nfunding for youth work with girls and young women, but in compensatory rather than \npolitical terms. Hitherto, feminist practice was to be located almost entirely in the person \nof individual youth workers and by the end of the twentieth century, feminist youth work \ncould no longer be said to exist in any meaningful sense.7  \n \nForgetting feminist youth work \nDespite the production and publications of a wide variety of texts, including \nnewsletters, reports, films, photographs, and posters, the creative energy of feminist \nyouth work has been largely erased from the memory of contemporary youth work. The \n 4 \ntextual evidence of face to face feminist practice is now widely scattered, mainly in \npersonal collections and is largely inaccessible to a new generation of female youth \nworkers operating in a different policy environment. Loss of the documentary evidence of  \neveryday youth work is not unique to feminist approaches. It is partly a consequence of \nthe shifting terms of reference facing an unstable professional group, exacerbated by the \ntransitory nature of youth and by the working class dimensions of the practice field.  \nSmall organisations, with short term funding are born and die: their records disappear. \nOther organisations change focus, adapting to policy priorities to survive. Papers relating \nto past work are deemed no longer relevant, especially when there is pressure on \nstorage space. However, the effect of the \u201cdominance of the male agenda,\u201d is to \nsubmerge even further the memories and evidence of work with girls and women.8  This \nis particularly the case when there has been conflict relating to organisational politics \nand direction, such as that associated with the growth and decline of feminist youth \nwork.  \n \nThe \u201chidden from history\u201d thesis encouraged some feminist workers during the \n1970s and 1980s to seek evidence for a history of female work with girls. 9  The archives \nof NAYC, which started its life in 1911 as the National Organisation of Girls\u201f Clubs, \nbegan to reveal a history of Girls\u201f Club Work which had been submerged in the drive \ntowards mixed club work in the interwar years. However, no sustained historical work \nwas undertaken from within the professional youth work field either to apply a critical \nreading to these records or to access the memories of older youth workers who might \nhave been involved in the processes of change. Consequently, the loss of the Girls\u201f Club \nMovement appeared to feminist practitioners to be a simple matter of \u201cmale colonisation\u201d \nof resources which rightly belonged to women.10 Subsequent accounts by historians \nreveal the extent to which girls and women themselves exercised agency in a process \nshaped by particular structural and cultural conditions, driving the changes themselves.11 \nThis reading is corroborated by a former chief executive of the NAYC who on the basis \nof his involvement in the organisation during the 1950s, stresses the determination of the \nwomen concerned to be responsive to the real conditions and interests of young \npeople.12  The simplistic recovery of \u201ctheir\u201d history was symptomatic of the \nunderdevelopment of feminist youth work theory and was not ultimately helpful insofar \nas it encouraged a mechanistic determination to \u201creclaim\u201d their organisations which \nheightened gender conflict in those organisations. Objectively, feminist workers were \n 5 \nnever in a position to win such conflicts. Moreover, the emphasis upon the importance of \nsingle sex organisation in the historical records precluded a more nuanced analysis of \nthe different values and politics of the girls\u201f club movement and second wave feminism \nand so the opportunity was missed to sharpen through historical awareness, the central \npriorities and values of feminist youth work. \n \nThe analysis in this article is alert to these problems in the \u201creclamation\u201d of the \nearlier history and pursues a more critical interrogation of the later movement. It is \ninformed by my own participation between 1976 and 1983 as a practising feminist youth \nworker, and subsequently as a community and youth work tutor and researcher in which \ncontext there has been a continuing informal \u201cfeminist\u201d conversation amongst a small \nnetwork of women. In these conversations the problem of the \u201csilencing\u201d of \u201cour\u201d history \nhas been a significant theme, prompting increased levels of historical research and \nactivity.13 The idea of \u201chidden from history\u201d informed my own earliest approaches and \npersuaded me of the importance of collecting documents produced by women involved \nin the \u201cMovement\u201d for working with girls. These include the  full run of the \u201cWorking with \nGirls Newsletter,\u201d produced by the Girls Work Unit between 1981 and 1987, numerous \nAnnual Reports documenting the work of Girls and Young Women\u201fs Projects, and a \nvariety of associated materials such as photographs, posters and minutes (mainly from \nWear Working with Girls Development Group). This documentary evidence is \nsupplemented by interviews undertaken in North East England with 40 female youth \nworkers in 1988 and with 21 self-identified feminist youth workers in 1992. 14 \n  \n \nThe Emergence of Feminist Youth Work  \nAt the start of the 1970s, girls and young women clearly had a problematic relationship \nwith informal youth provision. The Albemarle Report had raised the issue as early as \n1960. 15  In 1964, the Young Women\u201fs Christian Association (YWCA) and the London \nUnion of Youth Clubs (LUYC), set up a committee to \u201cstudy the needs and interests of \ngirls\u201d, to \u201cprovide training materials for leaders working with girls in mixed clubs\u201d and to \n\u201cdiscover why girls are not making use of the youth service.\u201d The subsequent research \nstudy, undertaken by Jalna Hanmer noted that girls,  \u201c\u2026do not seem to be as highly \nregarded as boys in clubs;\u201d  that  \u201c\u2026\u201fgirls only\u201f activities \u2013 no matter what they are \u2013 are \nhighly valued\u2026provided [the girls] do not feel that their wish to associate with boys is \n 6 \nbeing curtailed\u201d; and that  \u201c\u2026a mixed club should have both men and women \nstaff\u2026there are fewer women than men in the Youth Service and what is more serious, \nfewer women are being trained for the work.\u201d16   \n \nThis situation had arisen because of the systematic \u201cmixing\u201d of girls\u201f clubs begun \nin the inter-war years. After the First World War, idealised concepts of \u201cyouth\u201d coincided \nwith essentialist theories of adolescence, replacing discourses of poverty, class and \ngender in shaping youth organisations. Simultaneously, popular ideas about the \u201cmodern \ngirl\u201d challenged pre-war assumptions about the nature of femininity. Girls no longer \nexpected to be separated from boys or chaperoned.17  Youth work meanwhile was \nincreasingly concerned with organising youth leisure, distinct from social work. Most new \norganisations such as the Youth Hostels Association created in 1928 integrated new \nperspectives from the outset, but the National Association of Boys Clubs (NABC), \ncreated in 1925 was founded upon ideals of masculinity and determined to maintain its \nsingle sex clubs. In contrast, local girls\u201f clubs increasingly admitted boys and in \nresponse the NOGC addressed the question of mixed clubs. Throughout the 1930s they \npursued the possibility of partnership with NABC but meeting with recalcitrance, in the \nconditions of the second world war and after the establishment of the statutory youth \nservice in 1939,18 the girls club movement took independent action, becoming the \nNational Association of Girls Clubs and Mixed Clubs in 1943.19  \n \nThe process of mixing girls clubs was relentless, continuing throughout the 1950s \nand dovetailing with the conservative perspectives on gender roles re-asserted in post \nwar policy. By the time of Albemarle, single sex girls\u201f work survived only within the \nuniformed organisations, such as the guides and in 1961 the former NOGC dropped any \npretence to single sex girls\u201f work and became NAYC. In 1957, Josephine Macalister \nBrew, who supported mixed sex clubs, noted (ironically in their defence) that the process \nof admitting boys was accompanied by a tendency for female participation to decline.20 \nThe decline was such that the interests of girls almost disappeared from programmes. \nProfessional wisdom maintained that female interests focused mainly upon finding a \nmarriage partner and therefore the main reason for female attendance was \u201cfor the \nboys.\u201d  This view remained prevalent into the 1970s. It focused attention on boys and \nexcused the need to make special provision for girls. Consequently efforts to address \nthe \u201cproblem\u201d of girls were sporadic and isolated. 21 \n 7 \n \nHowever gender relations and female expectations were shifting. Notably in \nresponse to the development of the contraceptive pill and improved access to \neducational and employment opportunities, by the 1970s the expectations of traditional \nfeminine stereotypes were out of kilter with real female lives. The Women\u201fs Liberation \nMovement, emerging from the maelstrom of the late 1960s, expressed something of the \nextent of female dissatisfaction, but other types of female activism, located in traditional \nfemale roles associated with working class family and neighbourhood, were becoming \nincreasingly politicised in the context of urban decay and renewal. Initiatives associated \nwith Community Development Projects, particularly provided opportunities for mature \nworking class women to become politicised.22 Both traditions of female dissent and \norganisation coalesced in the hybrid conditions of youth work in the early 1970s. The \nstatutory sector had expanded as a result of Albemarle, and a new voluntary sector was \ntaking shape as a consequence of urban policy and community development including \nsmall scale locally based youth projects.23 The 1969 publication of the hybrid report, \n\u201cYouth and Community Work in the 70\u201fs\u201d further opened professional youth work to the \ninfluence of community politics and amongst female youth workers, one of the \nconsequences was a dynamic coalition between the insights of women\u201fs liberation and \ncommunity politics.24 As a consequence, offering opportunities for working class girls via \nyouth work was to become a priority in feminist youth work.  \n \nFeminist initiatives in work with girls and young women began with revelations \nabout the extent and nature of female invisibility in youth provision. Statistical evidence \nconsistently demonstrated significant gender inequality in youth service allocation and \nthe women\u201fs arguments focused on  the pretensions of the Youth Service to offer \n\u201cuniversal\u201d provision for young people. Thus, in the Inner London Education Authority \n(ILEA) in 1981, it was estimated that youth club membership of girls was only one third \nthat of boys, (excluding the London Federation of Boys Clubs), and that some of the \nLondon boroughs were spending as much as five times on boys as on girls.25 In 1982, a \nreport for ILEA about Camden, suggested that the estimate of a 30 per cent female \nmembership of clubs did not reflect reality: \u201cA consensus was reached by all workers \ninterviewed that within a mixed club situation, the ratio of boys to girls was at least 4:1 \u2013 \nin some cases it was actually 10:1.\u201d26 Such figures were estimates, but it could not be \ndisputed that all positions of power within the hierarchy of the Camden Youth Service \n 8 \nwere male \u2013 including the Chair of the area youth committee, the acting senior youth \nofficer, two youth officers and the administrative officer. Meanwhile, of 49 full time youth \nworker posts, 31 were male and 18 female of which in senior worker posts, 12 were held \nby men and 3 by women.27  In the specialist and uniformed sector where single sex work \nsurvived, NAYC research revealed that in 1980-81, National Headquarters Grants to \nsingle sex male youth organisations totalled \u00a3291,700 compared with a female \nequivalent of \u00a3115,250. In 1981-82 the figures were worse, with the male sector \nachieving an increase of 9%, bringing the total grant to \u00a3318,100 compared with a 5.8% \nincrease for the female sector to \u00a3121,950.28  Gender inequity in resource allocation was \nformally recognised in the Thompson review of youth service provision in England and \nWales in 1982. Thompson cautiously asserted that \u201cin terms of membership of youth \ngroups of all kinds, boys outnumbered girls by about 3:2, and that in terms of their \nparticipation in activities and the use of facilities, the boys are much more conspicuous \nthan this proportion would suggest.\u201d29  \n \nThe bare figures say nothing of the reality encountered in practice. Female youth \nworkers documented how activities, time and space in youth clubs were dominated by \nthe interests and demands of boys, how girls were to be found in traditional spaces, \nhelping behind the coffee bar, watching male activities or congregating in the female \ntoilets. It was noted that in youth clubs girls were often harassed, threatened and \nintimidated by boys and that their attempts to participate in activities, encountered active \nresistance not only from boys, but also from male workers.30   \n \nBecause conditions in youth clubs were so inimical to their interests, female \nyouth workers were often attracted to employment in the detached and \u201cexperimental\u201d \nprojects created in the wake of Albemarle and via community development initiatives.31 \nYet even here there were gender difficulties. Detached work had a reputation for \nresponding to the troublesome street presence of boys and its status within the \nprofession was as the \u201craw edge\u201d of youth work. Liz Macalister of the Islington project \nclaimed in 1984, that \u201cAfter years of struggle\u201d to establish detached work with girls, \n\u201cPressure still exists to concentrate on \u201eheavy end\u201f boys and act as troubleshooters.\u201d32 In \nother experimental projects, and in \u201cspecial\u201d activities designed to attract more girls into \nclubs, there was a continuing tendency to interpret girls\u201f needs with reference to their \nsexuality or their interest in boys and young men. The editorial of a special Health Issue \n 9 \nof the Working with Girls Newsletter explained, \u201cWhen we started work on this \nedition\u2026we were very conscious of the way health and (young) women all too often gets \ninterpreted as being about heterosexual sex. The equation goes; young women + health \n= contraception\/abortion\/pregnancy\/VD.\u201d33   \n \nConfronted with institutionalised masculinity in their work environment, female \nworkers were themselves constrained by gender stereotypes.  In the first edition of the \nWorking With Girls Newsletter (WWGN) in 1981, Val Marshall complained that: \n  \n\u201cThe major concern of Youth Service seems to be the preservation of a male \ndominated society, dependent for its continued existence on a constant supply of \nhome loving wives and mothers, willing to cook, clean, copulate, and procreate \non demand, and it will stay that way for as long as the men dominating our \nprofessional service refuse to volunteer a realistic partnership with women.\u201d34  \n \nFeminists therefore linked the interests of girls and young women as service \nusers with their own interests as female workers. They sought initially to increase female \naccess and participation, and in so doing to create the circumstances in which their own \nautonomous practice might thrive. The claim for redistribution of resources in favour of \ngirls implied no presumption to changed practices, although it inevitably encountered \nresistance in a climate of scarcity. However, when this was linked with a demand for \nsingle sex space in which different female-centred approaches to youth work might be \nexplored, a different order of challenge was involved. Not only did it implicitly question \nprevailing methods and values, but it also subverted traditional assumptions about the \ncontrol of space in which in which junior workers were supervised and in which the \nbehaviour of girls was policed by boys.35 As the feminist discourse became more \nassertive, the insistence on the interrelationship between the personal and the political \nbrought into youth work a critique of the conditions under which girls and women lived  \nwhich explicitly questioned gender relations in the youth work setting. At the same time, \nthe interpersonal and collective dimensions of feminist youth work organisation \nundermined the values of individual skill and neutrality assumed within traditional notions \nof professionalism. Meanwhile, the success of feminist work in engaging young women \nin activities whilst focusing on questions of identity, identification and a critique of gender \nrelations threatened to displace the comfortable work established by men and boys \n 10 \naround leisure activity whose metaphor was the ubiquitous pool table. The resulting \ngender-based conflict between youth workers described in the literature was probably \ninevitable, but the women who described such conflict and suffered from it, were seldom \nin a position to analyse its source and relevance. Mostly the accounts suggest that the \nwomen were simply hurt and confused by the strength of feeling provoked by their \nsuccessful initiatives.  \n \nFeminist Practice \n \nThe value of single sex organisation was learned from the wider women\u201fs \nmovement and used by feminist youth workers to challenge the notion that girls were \n\u201conly interested in boys.\u201d The earliest \u201cgirls only\u201d event documented in my archive \ndescribes a successful Girls\u201f Conference in Waltham Forest in 1976. Subsequently, high \nprofile female-only events such as girls\u201f days and activities weekends were used to \npresent alternative role models of women acting in leadership, using a range of non-\ntraditional skills and pursuing enthusiasms in their own terms.  The activities included in \nthe second Waltham Forest conference in 1978 are fairly representative of the type of \nprogramme associated with Girls\u201f Days. The conference comprised a range of \nworkshops each attended by about 30 girls, although it was estimated that about 50 \nattended the Rape Crisis workshop. A theatre production entitled Our Way, dealt with \n\u201cWorking life and opportunities for women at work and the problems involved regardless \nof a woman\u201fs place within the hierarchy.\u201d There were a Health Education display, a \nphotographic exhibition showing women in a range of work and life situations, and stalls \nselling feminist literature and posters. Informal discussion areas were set aside to \nfacilitate interaction. A group named Clapperclaw enabled participants to make their own \nmusic at the end of the day.  The Report claimed that 200 girls and young women \nparticipated. Such occasions had an important advantage of demonstrating numerically \nthat given appropriate conditions, girls really were not a problem. 36    \n \nHigh profile events, frequently organised by women in addition to their contracted \nresponsibilities, tended to incorporate and enhance smaller scale initiatives. The 1980 \nGirls Day in Sunderland involved a number of girls groups from local youth projects in \nproviding the food and music for the day. For the workers, organising the Girls\u201f Day \noffered an opportunity to meet, discuss their work, learn new skills, share resources and \n 11 \nsignificantly, to engage with women youth workers who did not necessarily identify as \nfeminist but were interested in involving girls in their practice. Such productivity made a \nsignificant contribution to validating feminist practice, increasing the professional \nconfidence of the women and offering legitimacy for their arguments for single sex space \nand time in local projects.37  \n \nDespite the documented success of such initiatives in addressing an \nacknowledged problem about levels of female participation, and despite funding derived \npartly from central organisational budgets, feminist youth workers persistently \nencountered hostility especially with regard to their insistence upon female only \nenvironments.  The 1978 Waltham Forest Conference Report notes that, \u201cThe boys were \na constant problem throughout the day.\u201d They were never to cease to be so.  \u201c\u201fThe boys \nhate girls night,\u201f said one Camden youth worker. \u201eThey usually try to break the door \ndown. They think it\u201fs a poxy club, but they\u201fd rather be in it than not.\u201f\u201d38 Resenting their \nexclusion from time and space normally claimed as their own, and to the activities and \nconversations of the girls which they normally controlled, boys constantly intruded. \nWomen suggested that male colleagues could support female work by undertaking anti-\nsexist work with boys, and by providing back up whilst female-only sessions were \nunderway but sympathetic support was sporadic. Youth work which centred the female \nperspective, rather than simply reproducing traditional ideas about gender roles and \ngirls\u201f interests in beauty, cookery and boys, was met mostly with sustained opposition. \nSometimes this erupted into major organisational struggles leading to the resignation or \ndismissal of \u201cdifficult\u201d feminist workers.  \n \nIn 1980, Val Marshall, the Area Field Officer for the London Union of Youth Clubs \n(LUYC), was \u201cin effect instantly dismissed. And some time ago her innovative girls\u201f page \nin the union\u201fs bulleting was banned by a senior officer.\u201d39 The first issue of WWGN \nseems to allude to this when it reported that the LUYC had  \n \n\u201c\u2026rejected suggestions that it should appoint a full time worker to support and \ndevelop work with girls\u2026Following recent upheavals with LUYC, attention has \nfocused on what many youth workers believe to be the lack of serious \ncommitment to girls\u201f work within the union.\u201d40 \n \n 12 \nLUYC had started life as the London Union of Girls Clubs, founded by Maude Stanley, \nthe pioneer of London girls\u201f clubs in the late nineteenth century. Like the NOGC, it had \nresponded to the demand for mixed gender clubs in the inter war years accepting \norganisational responsibility for such clubs in 1949. Attempts to re-establish girls work \nwithin such organisations perceived by feminist youth workers partly as a means of \nreclaiming control of women\u201fs resources, were met with personal as well as institutional \nresistance. As Marshall wrote, \u201c\u2026strong opposition exists to the re-creation of the girls\u201f \nclub movement to service the needs of girls. Such demands are labelled \u201ewomen\u201fs lib\u201f or \n\u201eunhealthy\u201f; the women making such demands are described as \u201edifficult\u201f, and in some \ncases dismissed from their employment.\u201d41 Published references to Marshall\u201fs conflict \nwith the LUYC are elliptical, possibly because there were conditions in a financial \nsettlement which she achieved with the organisation which required that she should \u201cgo, \nkeep quiet about it, and not resort to her legal rights.\u201d 42 Such conditions in themselves \ncreate silences in the historical account. I recall that the matter was central to \ndiscussions and decisions taken at the Women Youth Workers\u201f conference in \nNottingham University in 1981 even though this is not apparent in the texts.  \n  \nOrganisational disputes such as this illustrate the entrenched positions taken by \nsome antagonists in this gender struggle. Yet the extent of resistance is undocumented \nbecause it was mainly expressed in low level, daily processes of attrition. One of the \n1992 interviews offers an example of the pettiness of everyday struggles:  \n \n\u201c\u2026I had to wait until the male worker turned up with the keys to open the office \nand cupboards. I told him he was the man with the keys, with the power. I won \nthe battle. I haven\u201ft the front door keys, but the office and the cupboard. I opened \nthe cupboard and there was nothing there! After I\u201fd got the keys! He said, \u201eI \ndecided to have a change-around.\u201f \u201c43 \n \nIn spite of such antagonism, there was ambivalence at some levels around the technical \nachievement of access for girls. Feminist work helped fulfil the requirement to offer a \n\u201cuniversal\u201d service for young people and enabled youth work managers to claim that \ntheir organisations were successfully integrating girls and young women. It was the use \nof feminist analysis to pursue a wider political agenda for change which was problematic \nand encouragement was mainly offered in terms which did not acknowledge feminism. \n 13 \nRecognising the ambiguity, feminist workers often underplayed their feminist values and \nintentions in funding applications and in formal reports. Nevertheless, through the logic \nof their own position in connecting the personal and political, they constantly discovered \nthe limits of the liberalism and tolerance of colleagues and managers.  \n \nWomen Worker Groups \nA heightened emotional atmosphere of challenge and defence encouraged women to \nseek the support of female-only workers\u201f groups. Again, the model derived from the \nwomen\u201fs movement. A group was meeting in the London Women\u201fs Centre in Earlham \nStreet in early 1976. The notes from that group from June 1977 suggest that the women \ncombined practice matters ( organising a \u201cGirls\u201f Bop\u201d), with a determination to challenge \ntraditional stereotypes, (discussing a response to a leaflet entitled \u201cGetting Married,\u201d a \nFamily Doctor Publication), and a desire to campaign about inequality on other fronts, \n(agreeing to take issue with the youth workers\u201f union, the CYSA, which had published a \nhomophobic letter in its newspaper by someone signing themselves \u201cSam Nutter.\u201d)44  By \nthe early 1980s, groups were established across the UK. In 1981 there were at least six \nactive in the North Eastern region alone.  These groups offered mutual support, \nfacilitated the organisation of collaborative events, and promoted information, skills and \nresource sharing. They were a source of professional training, self education and \nconsciousness-raising and they also offered opportunities for developing collective \nstrategies in response to hostile conditions. One worker recollected a decade later:  \n \n\u201cThe Working With Girls Development Group in Newcastle, 1982-3, was really \ngood. Supportive. West End Work With Girls became a sub-group of the \nNewcastle group. We campaigned and helped each other. We had strength and \ndid positive work and made inroads into the Civic Centre. We got a budget. We \nwere achieving things and could tap into things\u2026 \n\u2026We organised a massive Girls\u201f Only Day in Otterburn. We contacted every \nsingle woman worker in the city\u2026We had 200 on the day. Mams came too. \nVolunteers, full time and part time workers. Everyone was good together. It \nwasn\u201ft competitive. We ended the day with a massive barbeque. There was no \nviolence or aggression. We sang songs.45  \n \n 14 \nYet even here, the ideal of involving a wide range of women or drawing down \norganisational funds meant that some groups were shy of advertising feminist \ncredentials. Their declared emphasis remained with the development of youth work with \ngirls. Nevertheless:    \n \n\u201cThe feminist analysis was quite important. Without it we wouldn\u201ft have put in all \nthat energy. It captured a sense of idealism and political purpose. It was self-\nexploitative but the passion was important and infectious and helped us have \nsome successes.\u201d46   \n \n \nFeminism was an ever-present but subterranean discourse which became \nunstable and vulnerable as organisational began to change. In May 1983, the Tyneside \nWorking with Girls Development Group discussed the need to have a \u201cpositive structure\u201d \nhaving worked in an \u201cad hoc way until now.\u201d This meeting covered four main items: 1. \nFinancial Report; 2.Formation of a WWGDG Management Group; 3.National Girls\u201f Work \nNetwork; and 4. National Association of Youth Clubs.  The minutes refer to activities, \nconferences and skills but focus mainly on the question of democracy and \nrepresentation within the group pursued under Item Two. It was noted that members had \nworked to \u201cgain credibility and benefits for girls\u201f work;\u201d that they had pressed the \nNewcastle Youth Service to employ a girls\u201f worker; and that a worker might be seconded \nfrom the Education Department for girls\u201f work.  \n \nThe differences between Earlham Street in 1977 and Tyneside in 1983 suggest \nsome inroads into organisational cultures and practices. Attendance at women workers\u201f \ngroup meetings had become more generally accepted as a part of paid work time and \nemployers appeared to be responding to the call for more female workers at senior \nlevels. In  Newcastle, the local authority did eventually agree to appoint a youth officer \nwith a remit to develop work with girls, although this was additional to taking \nresponsibility for all youth work in the west end of the city. Meanwhile, also in1983, ILEA \nappointed a Youth Officer with special responsibility for work with girls and women. \nHaving begun using a fluid approach to organisation based on the feminist model of \nconsciousness-raising and campaigning groups, the women workers\u201f groups of the \n1980s began to adopt the conventions of public sector organisations. Increased \n 15 \nstructuring and formalisation of groups enabled them to become more streamlined with \nreference to influencing organisational decision making. However, their very success at \nthis level further diminished the practical usefulness of feminist language. As the groups \nbecame increasingly and narrowly focused upon sustaining and progressing work with \ngirls and young women, their developmental purposes subsided and a feminist critique \nof formal organisational power became increasingly irrelevant.  \n \nAs public expenditure cuts bit into worker time during the1980s, it became \ndifficult for youth workers to justify attending meetings except those which were \norganisationally accountable and had discernable outcomes. The survival of women \nworkers groups began to depend upon the support of sympathetic managers:  \n \n\u201cA woman worker\u201fs forum was set up\u2026There were 30 odd women there...  It had \nthe support of [a female officer]. We organised a very successful Girls\u201f Day which \nwe got the money for because of [the officer]. We had a women\u201fs social \u2013 about \n100 women in the community centre. We got funds for a Body Workshop and \nBeauty therapy equipment. We were asking questions about the body and the \nbeauty industry and real feminist questions. Then [the female officer] left and we \nwere left with all male officers. They liked to brag about our work but they did \nnothing to support it practically or financially and it fell on me and [M] (the full \ntime workers), plus some part timers. When the part time workers had their \nsessions cut, there was less and less participation from them and it kind of \ndwindled. It doesn\u201ft meet now because I\u201fve left and [M] is overworked.\u201d47 \n \nIn the north east of England, only two women youth workers groups survived the 1980s, \nboth because they were protected by female youth officers and because they had \nbecome incorporated into the structure of the youth service in question. During the \n1990s they were replaced by one group, co-ordinated by the Regional Youth Work Unit, \nformally open to men and with publicly circulated minutes. This was symptomatic of the \npicture across the UK. By 1990, organised feminist agendas, if not completely silent, \nwere retreating rapidly.  \n \n \n \n 16 \nThe causes of decline  \nA heady dynamic period of growth in the early 1980s had seemed to be leading towards \na period of consolidation in which it was hoped that girls\u201f work (and with it feminist \nperspectives) would \u201ccome in from the margins.\u201d48  This was not to materialise. An \nincremental shift of power towards centralised state control of professional interventions \nthrough organisational management and systems revealed the shallowness of the \nconcessions to feminist practice and the fragility of the ambiguous spaces in which it has \ngrown. Changing conditions in turn irritated the fissiparous tendencies of feminism \nwherein sisterhood had always been challenged by other structural inequalities in \ndifferences. Feminist youth work began to fracture both horizontally and vertically.   \n \nCentral control was exerted mainly through financial management during the \n1980s but not just in youth services. For example, feminist youth work was significantly \nundermined by changes in the rules of the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). The \nEOC gave \u00a33,326.42 between April 1978 and August 1980 to support \u201cone-off\u201d youth \nwork initiatives to encourage the participation of girls and young women. Mostly the \ngrants were for single sex activities for girls, but they also supported explicitly feminist \nevents such as the  national conference of 1980 entitled \u201cWomen\u201fs Liberation in Youth \nWork \u2013 A Feminist Perspective.\u201d Val Carpenter, the NAYC Girls\u201f Work Officer claimed \nthat   \n \n\u201c\u2026the EOC has been responsible for the very beginnings of work which could \nchange the face of the Youth Service. In every locality where EOC funding has \nbeen granted there have been positive effects felt by girls, individual youth \nworkers and the Youth Service generally.\u201d49  \n \nEncouraged by the EOC\u201fs interpretation of single sex work with girls as a contribution to \n\u201cachieving real equality of opportunity for women,\u201d50 feminist workers began to rely on \nthe support.  Then in April 1982, the Durham Girls\u201f Work Group applied for funding for \nhalf the cost of a Girls\u201f Day. Two days before the event, they were told verbally that their \ngrant was to be refused because of a reinterpretation of the Sex Discrimination Act.  \nNew rules required any single sex work with girls in a mixed project to be matched by \nparallel and equal arrangements for boys. Applications were required to be explicit about \n 17 \nthe educational content of the event which in turn needed to consonant with the \nmainstream work of the project, and this required verification from external referees.51  \n  \nThis rule change was indicative of formalisation of control of the allocation of \ngrants and expressed a reaction against the idea of \u201cpositive discrimination\u201d as \norganisational compensation for the consequences of personal \u201coppression.\u201d Positive \ndiscrimination in employment practices and intervention methods was henceforth to be \nreplaced by formal and legalised systems-based approaches to equality of access to \nand participation in organisations. This implied an inversion feminist understanding. If \norganisations were equal and accessible, then failure to access them or thrive within \nthem could be blamed on deficits in individuals rather than structures. Politicised \ninterventions would be irrelevant. Feminist youth worker support for the development \nequal opportunities policies was in this sense inimical to their intentions.  \n \nProgressing feminist youth work had to some extent relied upon the liberalism of \na public sector which offered some autonomy to professional workers. In this, there was \nroom for different inflections of meaning to co-exist.  As the 1980s progressed, \norganisational meanings were to become more absolute and fixed in favour of \nmanagerial expectations.  The instability of working with ambiguity was signalled early in \nthe fate of the national NAYC Experimental Project for Work With Girls funded between \n1978 and 1981 by the Department of Education and Science (DES) through NAYC. \nMuch of the documentation from this project remains closed to public access, and a \nreport for the DES, written by the consultant, Josephine Klein, is labelled \u201cConfidential.\u201d \nNevertheless, sufficient information is in the public domain to give some account of \nevents. 52  The project employed three workers for three years to undertake action \nresearch in order to assess the value of detached youth work for young people defined \nas \u201cat risk.\u201d NAYC originally defined \u201crisk\u201d as \u201cprostitution\u201d and with reference to \u201cblack or \nasian (sic) girls, young unmarried mothers, girls excluded from school and regular users \nof cafes, clubs, discos etc.\u201d53 However the workers argued that their research and \npractice revealed that girls considered themselves at risk as a consequence of their \nsocial and personal positioning. In a project pamphlet entitled Feeling Scared and Being \nPowerful, major section headings included: \u201cIt surprises you the sort of men who bother \nyou- they\u201fre so ordinary, could be your mate\u201fs dad, or your uncle!\u201d Objecting to the \nnotion that Black and Asian young women were at risk by virtue of race or ethnicity, one \n 18 \nof the workers pursued a different perspective on the lives of young black women, \npublished in 1980 as, Hamari Rangily Zindagi (Our Colourful Lives).54 In keeping with \nfeminist analyses of the silencing of working class female voices, the workers were keen \nto let the words of the girls speak about \u201crisk\u201d for themselves. This was a fundamental \nthreat to the balance of ambiguous meaning. Its linguistic power is apparent in a number \nof publications derived from the project. The front page of one pamphlet relating to \nmenstruation contains the word, \u201cPeriods\u201d (written in a way to suggest blood) \nsurrounded by words such as \u201con the rag,\u201d \u201cdripping,\u201d \u201cJam.\u201d  Such language, \nrepresented as the \u201cauthentic\u201d voice of working class girls mediated through feminist \nyouth work, transgressed tacitly accepted professional boundaries and was experienced \nas a serious challenge to the \u201crespectability\u201d of the sponsoring and participating \norganisations. The response involved banning the workers from all public buildings in the \nlocal authority area and invoked legalistic and bureaucratic authority to interrogate the \nvalidity of the research, the professional competence and the personal attributes of the \nworkers. The last year of this project, which seemed to have achieved some success \nboth in feminist terms, and technically met the original terms of the funding, was \ncharacterised by disillusionment, conflict and disarray because it had uncovered the \nlimits of organisational liberalism by forcing the ambiguous to become unabiguous.     \n \nAs structural and discursive spaces for manoeuvre closed down, the personal \nvulnerability of feminist workers increased. It therefore appeared to be a rational strategy \nto turn attention to possibilities for influencing organisational decision-making. Mainly this \ntranslated into engagement with organisational policy development, specifically with \nreference to the delineation of equal opportunities policies.55  This strategy persuaded \nsome women to seek management positions in the belief that they would thereby gain \nmore influence in policy decisions.  Yet in 1986, referring to the energy spent by women \nworkers in one local authority, an HMI report into youth service responses to the needs \nof young women noted that, \u201cIn this authority, the conscious decision to attempt to \nchange policies had left little energy for work on the ground\u201d.56 As the HMIs observed, \nfeminist workers now found themselves forced to make choices about \u201cwhether their job \nwas to work to improve policies authority-wide or through example in face to face \npractice.\u201d The movement of some women into policy and management demanded a shift \naway from identification with girls and young women towards professional organisational \nprocesses which in other circumstances were experienced as in conflict with feminist \n 19 \nvalues. Despite personal good will, this resituated young women as the objects of \npractice interventions and dented trust between women in different positions of power. \nHorizontal cracks began to open in their support systems. At the same time other \ndifficulties, also associated with the personal-political spectrum of feminist youth work \nand mainly relating to the identity politics of class, race, sexuality, disability and age \nwere intruding upon relationships between women workers, causing vertical rifts.   \n \nWillingness to address manifestations of structural inequality across a range of \npersonal and institutional boundaries had been integral to the feminist project.57 \u201cYou \nlearn about institutional racism\u2026It\u201fs given me lots to think about. It\u201fs forced me to do \nthings like anti-racist training which I think if I hadn\u201ft been doing this work I wouldn\u201ft have \ntaken on board so much.\u201d58 Personal dimensions demanded both that individuals \norganise for social change, and also seek to change their own attitudes. However, this \npositive attribute contained a potential for tension between women which threatened to \nbecome strategically and emotionally debilitating. Differences between women easily \nbecame disputes in a climate of political reaction and diminishing resources. Suspicions \nabout endemic prejudice and discrimination within the feminist project, particularly in \nrelation to racism and heterosexism led to demands for separate work with young black \nand Asian women and young lesbians which were irresistible in view of the logic of \nseparate work with girls. Some disputes spilled out on the public stage.  Thus, when a \ncollective group set up to compile a book about girls\u201f work under the aegis of the NAYC \ndisintegrated between 1981 and 1983 amid accusations of racism, acrimonious letters \nwere widely circulated. 59  Personal identities were conflated with structural inequalities \ncreating a volatile emotional environment which seriously destabilised feminist youth \nwork.  \n \nNevertheless, the critical blow was managerial.  In 1987 on the appointment of \nJan Holt the new chief executive of NAYC, the Girls Work Unit was closed and its \nworkers made redundant with 24 hours notice. The unit had been the hub of feminist \nyouth work organisation and communication and the closure was described at the time \nby a campaigner as \u201cknocking away \u2013or, even worse, stealing \u2013 one of the cornerstones \nof this work.\u201d 60 The background story of the Girls\u201f Work Unit closure remains \nundocumented. Officially, a budget deficit of over \u00a3100,000 demanded a reorganisation \nof, \u201call aspects of the Association\u201fs work.\u201d61  Holt maintained that the commitment of \n 20 \nNAYC to girls\u201f work had not diminished but would now be integral to the organisation. 62  \nThis rationale was in keeping with the recommendations in the 1983 Thompson Report \nthat single sex work was valid but only as a temporary expedient until organisations had \nachieved equality of opportunity.63  The affected workers meanwhile were convinced that \nclosure was a response to the success of feminist work.  Val Carpenter suggested that:  \n \n\u201cWe are not just talking about single sex work but about working with young \nwomen in a mixed setting. I think this is where the association has been unable \nto live with our work. We are talking about mainstream issues, and they either \nhad to axe the unit or start taking the implications seriously.\u201d64  \n \nIt is recorded that Holt explained that, \u201cThere was now enough enlightenment about Girls \nWork to be included as part of the mainstream, and for the work to be developed in a \nmore constructive way.\u201c65  Here we perhaps glimpse a hint of the real problem \u2013 that \nfeminism was experienced as \u201cunconstructive\u201d or perhaps just \u201cdifficult.\u201d  \n \nConclusion \nDespite some remarkable successes, feminist youth work ultimately failed to achieve \nequality for girls and women within youth organisations or to establish anti-sexist \napproaches as mainstream. 66 When its ideas were acknowledged as valid, the price of \nadoption was incorporation which either stressed girls\u201f issues, or pursued a managerial \napproach to equal opportunities. At best, the issues raised by feminist youth workers \ncontributed knowledge and subject matter gained from close identification with working \nclass young women which informed service agendas. The pursuit of feminist ideals was \nalways limited by the diminishing resources of youth work and the centralising systems \nof accountability imposed on public services. The personal-political agenda which was \nso productive in an open climate of worker autonomy, became a destructive force in the \ncontext of retrenchment and reaction. Feminist energies were effectively co-opted and \nsubverted as women attempted to manage the new conditions and integrate their \napproaches into mainstream practice.   \n \nNevertheless there were real gains associated with the empowerment of the girls \nand young women who were touched by feminist work, and by those women workers \nwhose confidence, skill and understanding grew in the context of feminist support. At its \n 21 \nheart, the movement was deeply concerned to offer to girls and young women \nopportunities otherwise denied, investigating approaches which might enable them to \ndevelop their potential. The attention to enhancing the agency of girls and young women \nwho suffered multiple exclusions, particularly those of class, race and sexuality, but also \ndisability and age, was hugely valued by those who benefited. There are glimpses of this \nin the texts produced by the movement in which the voice of girls and young women as \nwell as workers, from different backgrounds and owning different identities could be \narticulated (albeit within respectable boundaries). Perhaps a movement whose principals \nwere dominated by ideals of \u201cliberation\u201d could ask for little more except that its \nsuccesses and struggles be remembered and its insights be developed.  In these terms, \nperhaps it is fitting to end with the appreciative words of a member of the Manor House \nGirls Group in 1980:  \n \nGirls Night \nHave you heard of this place,  \nWhere you get kids of many race,  \nOn Monday night is girls night,  \nWe have fun together and never fight.  \nYou will never be pushed around,  \nEven if you act the clown.  \nIf you don\u201ft believe what I say,  \nCome on down to Islington way.  \nOn girls night no boys allowed,  \nThen you get a lesser crowd.  \nYou can play football or pool \nAs long as you obey the rule.  \nMonday nights are for girls,  \nWhen it\u201fs like living in a woman\u201fs world.  \nWe play tennis, and do some cooking,  \nDon\u201ft worry no boys will be looking.  \nWe have this place for our own,  \nOn Monday nights no boys will Roam.  \nGirls Night, girls Night,  \nIsn\u201ft it a beautiful sight.67  \n 22 \n \n \n \n                                                 \nNotes \n1\n The Working With Girls Newsletter, (WWGN) 1981 to 1987 contains numerous examples of \nfeminist youth workers making connections with campaigns around issues such as sexual abuse \nwhich were later incorporated into other approaches. See M. Nava (1984) Drawing the Line, in \neds. A. McRobbie and M. Nava, Gender and Generation, (Basingstoke: Macmillan) pp. 85-111. \nAnti-oppressive practice was adopted within social work to describe aspects of practice which \nhad been named within feminist youth work as eg. \u201eanti-racism; anti-hetereosexism; anti-\ndisablism.  \n2\n The only legal responsibility for youth services, in the 1944 Education Act, was that local \nauthorities should ensure that \u201esufficient\u201f provision was made for the leisure and further education \nof young people.   \n3\n Quoted in J.
