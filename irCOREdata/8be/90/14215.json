Email and the World Wide Web are now used\nfor study purposes on an almost daily basis by the great majority of staff and students\n(Goodyear, Jones, Asensio, Hodgson and Steeples, 2001). Very many universities have\ninvested in 'Virtual Learning Environments' or 'Managed Learning Environments' (VLEs\nand MLEs) which allow integrated delivery to the student of a range of electronic services.\n17\nPeter Goodyear et al Relationships between conceptions of learning\nIn this paper, we are particularly concerned with a genre of online education which we call\n'networked learning' (Steeples and Jones, 2002). We define 'networked learning' as:\nlearning in which information and communications technology (ICT) is used to\npromote connections: between one learner and other learners, between learners and\ntutors; between a learning community and its learning resources.\nSome of the richest examples of networked learning involve interaction with online\nmaterials and with other people. But, in our view, use of online materials is not a sufficient\ncharacteristic to define networked learning. Human-human interaction (computer-\nmediated communication or CMC) is an essential part of networked learning. It is an\nimportant part of the pedagogical rationale for engaging 'conventional campus-based'\nundergraduate students in online education.\nMuch of the pioneering work in networked learning at the university level has taken place\nin the context of postgraduate courses (see, for example, Hartley, Tagg, Garber, Barry and\nFitter, 1991; Steeples, Johnson and Goodyear, 1992; Hodgson and McConnell, 1992; and\nalso the collections by Mason and-Kaye, 1989, and Kaye, 1992). There are some case\nstudies of undergraduate use of networked learning (such as Nicholson, 1999 and papers\nin Banks, Goodyear, Hodgson and McConnell, 2002). There is also a small literature on\nstudents' learning styles, personality measures and participation in networked learning\n(e.g. Atkins, Moore, Sharpe, and Hobbs, 2001; Dewar and Whittington, 2000; Smyth and\nBuckner, 2000). But, other than in the Open University, there has been relatively little\nresearch into networked learning on undergraduate courses jn the UK and a lingering\nsuspicion that it may be better suited to the postgraduate level and\/or to areas of higher\neducation in which students can be relied upon to be self-organizing, self-motivating and\nreflective (see for example, Romiszowski and Mason, 1996; Fredericksen, Pickett, Shea,\nPetz and Swan, 2000; Laurillard, 2001; Klassen and Vogel, 2001; Knight, 2002: 119).\nTwo studies which investigate connections between 'campus-based' undergraduates'\nparticipation in networked learning and their approaches to study should be mentioned.\nBoth were single institution studies and both used instruments developed by Noel\nEntwistle and his colleagues to represent aspects of students' approaches to study (Tait and\nEntwistle, 1996; Entwistle, Tait and McCune, 2000).\nGibbs (1999) reports data from a second-year course module in philosophy at the\nUniversity of Huddersfield, for which he was also the module leader. The course used the\nCo Mentor virtual learning environment. As part of the end-of-course evaluation, the 106\nstudents who took the module were asked to complete a version of the ASSIST approaches\nto study inventory (Entwistle et al., 2000). Students could choose between (a) having six of\ntheir online contributions count towards their module assessment or (b) taking an end-of-\ncourse exam. Gibbs' data show that students who took option (a) - students he regards as\nmaking regular use of CoMentor - scored higher on deep and strategic approaches to\nstudy than did students who chose option (b). Using students' own reports of their\nfrequency of use of CoMentor, the relationship between frequency of use and a deep\napproach weakens but a strong association with a strategic approach remains (Gibbs, 1999:\n226-8). Interpretation of the data needs to be tempered by the knowledge that only half\nthe students completing the course also completed the end of course evaluation and only\nhalf of these (29 students) took option (a).\n18\nALT-J Volume 11 Number I\nLight and Light (1999) also report research from a single institution (Southampton\nUniversity). They asked students who had and had not been active participants in CMC\ndiscussions on their course to take a version of Entwistle's Approaches to Study Inventory\n(ASI - Tait and Entwistle, 1996). They found that those who had participated actively in\nthe discussion scored higher on the 'deep approach to study' subscale while the non-\nparticipants scored higher on the 'surface approach to study'. However, (i) levels of\nparticipation in the CMC discussion had been low and unevenly distributed, with 60 per\ncent of the students having submitted one or no contributions, (ii) most student\ncontributions were questions directed to the lecturer, rather than part of a sustained group\ndiscussion, and (iii) only 24 students were involved in the study (12 participants; 12 non-\nparticipants) (Light and Light, 1999: 168-9).\nThese two studies are suggestive of some associations between approach to study and\ninvolvement in networked learning. However, the limitations of the studies - in the context\nof a relatively unexplored field - mean that further research is needed to determine whether\nor not there are significant connections between students' approaches to study and their\nexperience of networked learning.\nResearch methods\nResearch aims\nWe set out to test the following conjectures:\n1. Students with more elaborate conceptions of learning will report more positive end-of-\ncourse judgements about the value of their experiences of networked learning than will\nstudents who have less elaborate conceptions of learning.\n2. There is an association between approach to study and judgements about the value of\nnetworked learning experiences: deep and strategic approaches will correlate positively and\nsurface approaches negatively with such judgements of worth.\nMethods\nMuch of our research in the field of networked learning has made use of interview-based\ndata sources, allowing us to come closer to the personal experience and sense-making of\nthe participants (see, for example, Steeples and Jones, 2002). However, there is also value in\ncomplementing these studies with broader-based survey material. The present study makes\nuse of self-completion questionnaire techniques. These have the virtue of allowing\ncomparison across large numbers of students, though the imperatives of the survey\nmethod remove nuances from the data.\nInstruments\nThe research reported here makes use of three main instruments. Two of these have already\nbeen described in the literature, so we account for them only briefly here. The third is new\nand warrants a more detailed description.\nThe most familiar instrument is Entwistle's Approaches to Study Inventory (ASI). The ASI\nhas been a linchpin of research in higher education since the late 1970s and has been tested\nin a very large number of studies (Entwistle and Ramsden, 1983; Entwistle et al., 2000).\nThe instrumentation for the ASI has evolved over the years and, like Gibbs (1999) above,\nwe used the version called ASSIST. ASSIST exists in a number of forms. We used the 51-\n19\nPeter Goodyear et al Relationships between conceptions of learning\nitem ASSIST at the start of each course and the shortened 18-item ASSIST at the end of\neach course. ASSIST allows one to characterize students' reports of their approaches to\nstudy in terms of Deep, Strategic and Surface\/Apathetic approaches. '\nThe second instrument is also based on Entwistle's work with ASSIST, as well as on the\nideas of Marton, Saljo, Beaty, Dall'Alba and others (see for example, Marton, Dall'Alba,\nand Beaty, 1993; Beaty, Dall'Alba and Marton, 1997). The focus here is not on approach to\nstudy but conception of learning. Research on conceptions of learning among university\nstudents is not as highly developed as research on approaches to study. However, there is a\ngeneral view that students adopt more or less elaborate conceptions of learning and that\nthe more elaborate conceptions include rather than displace the less elaborate conceptions.\nStudents might typically move from a conception which is very focused on acquiring and\nrecalling factual information towards one which is concerned with developing as a person.\nOur questionnaire presented students with eight statements about learning. These are\nreproduced in Table 2. Students in our study were asked to record their response to each\nstatement on a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from 'very close' to 'very different' to\/from my\nown way of thinking about learning).\nWe developed the third instrument ourselves. The aim of this instrument was to capture\nstudents' overall judgements about the value of their experiences of networked learning, at\nthe end of their course. In particular, we wanted them to focus on whether the course's use\nof technology seemed worthwhile and enhanced their engagement in study activity. The\nend-of-course questionnaire contained forty Likert statements relating to the students'\nthoughts about the use of networked learning on the course they were just completing.\nThese statements were presented in two sets. A set of seventeen statements opened the\nquestionnaire. Then came the eight statements about conceptions of learning, followed by\nthe eighteen-item ASSIST inventory. After this came the second subset of twenty-three\nstatements about networked learning. We used the same set of twenty-three statements on\nboth the start-of-course and end-of-course questionnaires, adjusting only the tense of each\nstatement so that it was in the future tense at the start of the course and the past tense at\nthe end of the course. We have investigated the change in students' responses to these\ntwenty-three items from the start to the end of each course and have established that\nthough students' views moderate over time, the structure of expressed beliefs represented\nby the twenty-three statements remains fairly constant (Goodyear, Jones, Asensio,\nHodgson and Steeples, 2002). Consequently there is good reason to think that these\ntwenty-three statements are robust in combination as a tool for capturing some important\ndimensions of students' reported experiences.\nTo construct a single measure tapping students' overall judgements about the value of their\nexperiences of networked learning, we took their responses to the forty Likert statements\nand subjected them to principal components analysis. This is a technique for reducing the\ncomplexity of data by revealing underlying patterns of association between variables - in\nthis case the forty Likert statements. One very strong component emerged from this\nanalysis. It accounted for 24 per cent of the variance in the set of forty statements. (Each\nsubsequent component added only 1-2 per cent more in explained variance.) This caused\nus to focus on those Likert statements which were strongly associated with the first\ncomponent: that is, those twenty Likert statements which proved to have component\nloadings greater than plus\/minus 0.5. The twenty statements are listed in Table 1, together\n20\nALT-J Volume 11 Number I\nwith their mean scores for the whole sample of students. We then constructed a\nmeasurement scale by summing the scores on each of these twenty statements (reversing\nthe values on the nine negatively phrased statements) and dividing the result by twenty.\nThus a high mean value denotes a positive judgement about networked learning on all\ntwenty items. We carried out a reliability analysis of this twenty-item scale. The results\nwere very good indeed. The most commonly used measure of the reliability of this kind of\nscale is Cronbach's Alpha. The Alpha for this scale was 0.913, which is high. We also\ncalculated a split-half reliability measure, using Guttman's technique, and again found a\nreassuringly high value of 0.865. This leads us to conclude that the scale is highly reliable.\nWe examined each of the twenty items in turn to see whether the Alpha for the scale as a\nwhole would be improved by the deletion of the item. For none of the items was this the\ncase, so all twenty items are retained in our overall measure. It is always a little dangerous\nto try to capture the flavour of such a measure in a short title, but for convenience in\nreporting results in the rest of this paper, we refer to the scale measure as JNL -\njudgements about networked learning. Note that we do not claim that this is a stable or\ngeneral predisposition of the students.

The courses all involved a significant element of online\ncommunication, as described in the definition above, and also involved some timetabled\nface-to-face activity. None of the courses was being run for the first time. All the students\nwere undergraduate. Some were part-time, some full-time. All the courses were in an area\nof the social sciences and lasted either a term or a semester. The gender balance was 59 per\ncent female, which is not unusual in social science courses. Mean age was 24.7 years, with a\nmedian age of 22. All students were given a questionnaire at the start and towards the end\nof their course. The end-of-course questionnaires were completed before the students knew\ntheir end-of-course results. Students completed the questionnaires in timetabled face-to-\nface meetings so response rates were high and there are no grounds to presume that the\nresponses disproportionately represent students with strong views about their experience\n(positive or negative). Although tutors were able to see collated results, they could not link\nany questionnaire to the student who had completed it.\nMost of the data reported in this paper comes from the end-of-course questionnaire.\nHowever, we also wanted to be able to draw on the 51-item version of the ASSIST\napproaches to study inventory. This was completed by students when they filled in the\nstart-of-course questionnaire. The sample of students for whom we had both start-of-\ncourse and end-of-course questionnaires was smaller: 119 cases, of whom 106 provided a\nfull set of data.\nResults and discussion\nConceptions of learning\nThe first part of the analysis is concerned with conceptions of learning and the students'\noverall judgements about the use of networked learning technology on their course.

In each case we\nshow the number of students (the n column) who said that the statement was 'very close' to\nhow they thought about learning and the number who did not say the statement was very\nclose to how they thought about learning. (Note that it was open to students to rate any or\nall of the statements as 'very close' to the way they think about learning.) The column\nheaded 'mean JNL' shows the mean score on the overall judgement about networked\nlearning scale for each of the two groups of students ('very close' and otherwise), in\nrelation to each of the eight conceptions of learning.\nOne-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were run on each of the eight pairs of means.\nNone of the ANOVAs showed a statistically significant difference between the means. The\nF values and significance levels are shown in the columns headed F and p respectively.\nOnly statement 2, at p=0.066, comes anywhere near approaching a conventionally accepted\nlevel of statistical significance.\nThe interpretation of Table 2 is clear. At least in this sample, a student's conception of\nlearning has no effect on their overall judgements about their experience of networked\nlearning.\nTo check the robustness of this finding, we ran two more tests. First, we looked at the small\nsubset of students who said that both statement 1 and statement 3 came very close to their\nway of thinking about learning. These 24 students could be said to be strongly oriented\ntowards a conception of learning which is concerned with building knowledge by acquiring\nfacts and information and ensuring that they remember things well. This is towards the\nleast developed end of the hierarchy of conceptions of learning. We checked to see whether\nthe mean JNL score for these 24 students differed significantly from the mean JNL score of\nthe other 153 students. It did not. The means were identical.\nFinally, in case the way we had split students into the 'very close' and 'other' categories had\nhad an effect on the relationship with JNL score, we calculated Pearson product-moment\ncorrelation coefficients between the JNL score and scores on each of the eight\n'conceptions' variables. None of the correlations was significant at the 0.05 level. The\nnearest, again, was statement 2 (r= 0.176; p=0.065).\nThis leads us to conclude that there is no significant relationship between a student's\nconception of learning and their judgements about the use of networked learning\ntechnology. Those who believe that students with more elaborate conceptions of learning\nare likely to be more positive about networked learning may need to revise their views.\nApproaches to study\nThe second part of the study moves from conceptions of learning to approaches to study.\nWe had calculated, for each of the students in the sample, their scores on the Deep,\nStrategic and Surf ace\/Apathetic approaches to study. These were based on the 18-item\nversion of the ASSIST inventory. We calculated Pearson product-moment correlation\ncoefficients to measure the association between the JNL score and each of these three ASI\nscores. We found statistically significant correlations between JNL score and each of the\nthree measures (see the left hand half of Table 3). The correlation coefficients themselves\nwere modest in size, with the strongest correlation being between the Surface\/Apathetic\nApproach and JNL. Note this correlation is negative, meaning that students with a\n23\n.

Consequently we set out to\nreplicate the correlations within the smaller student sample for which we had ASI results\non the 51-item ASSIST inventory.\nThe resulting correlations are shown in the right hand half of Table 3. In each case, the\ncorrelation coefficients are lower, though they are in the same direction as the correlations\nfor the 18-item ASSIST. The lower correlations, coupled with the smaller sample size, place\neach of these associations on the margins of statistical significance (p>0.05 in each case).\nThis must cause us to view the correlations from the 18-item ASSIST with some\nscepticism. At best, there is tentative evidence of a weak association between approach to\nstudy and judgements about networked learning. Deep and strategic approaches show a\nweak positive association with a positive judgements about networked learning while the\nsurface\/apathetic approach shows a weak negative association.\nGiven the volume of literature underpinning the ASI as a predictor of positive learning\noutcomes in conventional undergraduate courses, the uncertainty surrounding our results\nis worthy of some further investigation. What we can say, however, is that we have found no\nconvincing evidence of a strong association between approach to study and judgements\nabout networked learning.\nConclusions\nThis study has a number of implications for practice and for further research. First, we\nwould argue that there are no good grounds for assuming that only students with\nsophisticated conceptions of learning, or who adopt a deep approach to study, are likely to\nbenefit from engagement in networked learning. If networked learning courses are well-\ndesigned and well-managed, then all students are likely to experience benefits. Second,\ngood design and management needs to be informed by an understanding of how students\nexperience networked learning. The JNL scale developed in this study foregrounds the use\nof technology. In some ways, this is a shorthand for 'the networked learning approach' in\nwhich the students found themselves to be involved. Our in-depth interviews with students\nshow that issues of collaboration and co-operation in learning were also in the foreground\n(Goodyear et al, 2001). Students showed particular concerns about the dependence of\n24\nALT-] Volume 11 Number I\ntheir assessment results on the efforts of others - an observation which is by no means\nspecific to networked learning contexts. Further work aimed at representing students'\nexperience of networked learning needs to help them articulate these and other concerns\nabout efficient, effective and enjoyable group-based learning. Finally, research and design\nneed to help us clarify expectations about the degree and pattern of involvement in online\nactivities. A theme in the literature on networked learning reflects disappointment about\nlower than expected levels of student engagement in online activities (for example, Jones,\nAsensio and Goodyear, 2000). We have little to help benchmark expectations - to help\nstudents, teachers and researchers ground their expectations about educational benefits in\na realistic set of heuristics about the level and degree of activity required. In further work,\nwe aim to explore these connections more thoroughly, looking particularly at the nexus\nbetween task design, online activity, student experience and learning outcome.\nAcknowledgements\nThe data-gathering work on which this paper builds was part-funded by the Joint\nInformation Systems Committee of the UK Higher Education Funding Councils through\na grant for a project on 'Students' experiences of networked learning in UK higher\neducation' held by Peter Goodyear, Vivien Hodgson and Christine Steeples.
