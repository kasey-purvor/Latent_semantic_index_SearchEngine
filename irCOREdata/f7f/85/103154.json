A method which incorporates\ncalculations using the parabolized stability equation (PSE) in the Orr\u2013Sommerfeld region\nalong with an upstream boundary condition derived from asymptotic theory in the vicin-\nity of the leading edge, is generalised to bodies with an inviscid slip velocity which tends\nto a constant far downstream. We present results for the position of the lower branch\nneutral stability point and the magnitude of the unstable Tollmien\u2013Schlichting (T\u2013S)\nmode at this point for both a parabolic body and the Rankine body. For the Rankine\nbody, which has an adverse pressure gradient along its surface far from the nose, we find\na double maximum in the T\u2013S wave amplitude for sufficiently large Reynolds numbers.\n1. Introduction\nWhen a body is placed in a mean flow with a small amplitude unsteady perturbation,\nthe position of boundary\u2013layer transition depends on the stability characteristics of the\nbody and the interactions of the unsteady disturbance with the boundary layer, a process\nis known as receptivity (Morkovin 1985). For two\u2013dimensional, large Reynolds number\nflows, the transfer of energy from the free\u2013stream disturbance to the instability wave\noccurs due to non\u2013parallel mean flow effects. These effects occur at the leading edge of\nthe body (Goldstein 1983), or further downstream where the mean flow varies rapidly\nin the streamwise direction, such as at surface roughness elements (Goldstein 1985; Ker-\nschen et al. 1990), regions of marginal stability (Goldstein et al. 1992) or changes in\nsurface roughness (Goldstein & Hultgren 1989). Once energy has been transfered to\nthis instability wave, the disturbance typically decays in amplitude downstream until\nthe lower branch neutral stability point is reached, beyond which the disturbance grows\nuntil nonlinear effects become important and transition occurs. The work Saric et al.\n(2002) reviews the asymptotic, numerical and experimental approaches to receptivity\nand transition.\nIn this paper we formulate a general theory for calculating the position of the lower\nbranch neutral stability point and the amplitude of the instability wave at this point\nfor bodies where the slip velocity tends to a constant far downstream. Using this theory\nwe make a comparison of the results for a parabolic body, which has a positive pressure\n\u2020 Current address: Mathematics Research Institute, School of Engineering, Computing and\nMathematics, University of Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QF, U.K.\n2 M. R. Turner and P. W. Hammerton\ngradient along its surface, and a Rankine body, which has a negative pressure gradient\nalong the majority of its surface. The qualitative behaviour of these two bodies along with\nthe flat plate considered in Turner & Hammerton (2006) cover bodies with a positive, a\nnegative and a zero pressure gradient on its surface.\nFor small amplitude unsteady disturbances to a semi\u2013infinite flat plate, Goldstein\n(1983) calculates the asymptotic structure along the plate for large Reynolds numbers.\nThis asymptotic structure consists of a region close to the leading edge where the flow\nis governed by the unsteady boundary layer equation. The far downstream asymptotic\nform of the solution in this region consists of a Stokes layer and a sum of asymptotic\neigenmodes (Lam & Rott 1960, 1993) which, through a multiplicative receptivity coef-\nficient, links the amplitude of these eigenmodes to the free\u2013stream disturbance. As we\nmove downstream of the leading edge, the linearised unsteady boundary layer equation\n(LUBLE) breaks down but it can be asymptotically matched to the large\u2013Reynolds\u2013\nnumber, small wave\u2013number form of the classical Orr-Sommerfeld equation. It is also\nshown that the first of the Lam-Rott eigenmodes matches to the unstable Tollmien\u2013\nSchlichting (T\u2013S) mode of the Orr\u2013Sommerfeld equation. In this Orr\u2013Sommerfeld region\nfor the semi\u2013infinite flat plate there exists asymptotic solutions to the two\u2013dimensional\nNavier\u2013Stokes equations which represent two\u2013dimensional T\u2013S eigenmodes at the lower\norders of approximation and eventually account for the weak non\u2013parallel flow effects\nat the higher orders (Smith 1979). This will yield expressions for both the growth rate\nand the mode shape of these eigenmodes. However this asymptotic expansion becomes\nnon\u2013uniform downstream when the work of Goldstein (1982) is considered, and so cannot\nbe used to calculate the amplitude of the unstable T\u2013S mode at the lower branch neutral\nstability point (Turner 2007). This non\u2013uniformity is not apparent in the work of Smith\n(1979), and is an ongoing topic of study.\nNumerous numerical studies have calculated growth rates of the T\u2013S modes in the\nOrr\u2013Sommerfeld region on a semi\u2013infinite flat plate. The simplest methods use just\nthe Orr\u2013Sommerfeld equation, but this approach neglects the streamwise growth of the\nboundary layer. The non\u2013parallel effects can be incorporated into this equation by con-\nsidering an asymptotic expansion in powers of Re\u22121\/2 where Re is the Reynolds number\n(Gaster 1974; Saric & Nayfeh 1975). This method is not asymptotically rigorous be-\ncause the O(1) equation of the expansion contains the O(1), O(Re\u22121\/6), O(Re\u22121\/3) and\nO(Re\u22121\/2 lnRe) terms, which have been proved to exist in Goldstein (1983). Similarly\nthe O(Re\u22121\/2) equation contains many asymptotic sub terms too. The study of Bertolotti\net al. (1992) uses this non\u2013rigorous asymptotic method to incorporate the non\u2013parallel\neffects into a single partial differential equation known as the parabolised stability equa-\ntion (PSE). In the last fifteen years the PSE formulation has been used extensively with\nextensions to take account of hypersonic flows, nonlinearity and chemical reactions within\nthe boundary\u2013layer flow, see for example Langlois et al. (1998) and Chang (2003). One\nadvantage of incorporating the non\u2013parallel effects into one equation is that this method\nreplaces the algebra of eliminating singular terms with numerical computations (Saric &\nNayfeh 1975). The PSE is marched downstream from some initial condition and is com-\nputationally faster than direct numerical simulations (DNS). Previous studies using the\nPSE (Bertolotti et al. 1992; Andersson et al. 1998) have initiated the code using an up-\nstream boundary condition from Orr\u2013Sommerfeld theory or using a local solution to the\nPSE, without taking complete account of the interaction of the free\u2013stream disturbance\nwith the boundary layer (the receptivity problem). Hence these methods only give the\namplitude of the unstable T\u2013S mode up to an unknown multiplicative constant. Turner &\nHammerton (2006) fix the value of this unknown constant by producing a method which\ncombines the PSE in the Orr\u2013Sommerfeld region with an upstream boundary condition\nAnalysis of the unstable T\u2013S mode on bodies with a rounded leading edge 3\nU\nU\nN \u03be Orr\u2212Sommerfeld\nLUBLE\nregime\nregimeOverlap\nregion\nlayer\nEdge of boundary 1\n2\n3\nrn\u03c9\nU8\n(Re) 3\n1\n8\n8\nR R\n\u03be   =0R\n1<\u03be   <R\n*\nN   =0R\nFigure 1.

This method\nallows the amplitude of the unstable T\u2013S mode to be calculated at the lower branch\nneutral stability point, and allows comparison with other numerical studies (Haddad &\nCorke 1998). This paper extends this method to incorporate bodies with non\u2013zero nose\ncurvature.\nFor bodies with a rounded leading edge, the same asymptotic structure as for the\nflat plate holds along the surface of the body, as shown in figure 1. The LUBLE region\nis valid when the streamwise variable \u03beR = \u03c9\u2217\u03be\u2217\/U\u221e = O(1) where U\u221e is the mean\nflow velocity and \u03c9\u2217 is the dimensional frequency of the free\u2013stream disturbance. The\nOrr\u2013Sommerfeld region is valid when \u03beR = O(Re1\/3) where Re = U2\u221e\/(\u03c9\n\u2217\u03bd) is the\nReynolds number based on the acoustic wavelength U\u221e\/\u03c9\u2217 (Goldstein 1983; Nichols\n2001; Turner 2005). The asymptotic Lam\u2013Rott eigenmodes for a flat plate have been\ngeneralised for a parabolic body by Hammerton & Kerschen (1996), who also calculate\nthe free\u2013stream dependent receptivity coefficient as a function of the nose radius. This\nanalysis has been generalised further by Nichols (2001) to bodies which have an inviscid\nfree\u2013stream velocity which tends to unity far downstream. Nichols also calculates the\nreceptivity coefficient for the Rankine body as a function of the nose radius.\nNumerical investigations of finite thickness bodies have mainly been carried out via\nDNS methods (Reed 1994). Fuciarelli et al. (1998) discuss such DNS results for a flat\nplate with an elliptical leading edge while the alternative approach of Corke and co\u2013\nworkers linearises about the basic flow, which then decouples the steady and unsteady\nflow fields that can then be solved separately. Haddad & Corke (1998) consider parabolic\nbodies at a zero angle of attack to the mean flow, while Erturk & Corke (2001) and\nHaddad et al. (2005) extend this to consider parabolic bodies with non\u2013zero angle of\n4 M. R. Turner and P. W. Hammerton\nattack. Wanderley & Corke (2001) consider bodies with an elliptical leading edge in\norder to compare with the results of Fuciarelli et al. (1998) and the experiments of Saric\n& White (1998). A purely asymptotic theory for these cases is not currently available\ndue to the algebraic complexity of the analysis and so the numerical and experimental\ninvestigations described above can not be compared to asymptotic theory. However the\nnumerical\/asymptotic theory for general bodies presented in this paper will allow for\ndirect comparisons in future studies.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 formulates the PSE for bodies with\nnon\u2013zero curvature, and also reviews the work of Nichols (2001) to give the general form\nof the leading\u2013edge asymptotic eigenmodes which can then be used as the upstream\nboundary condition for the PSE. Positions of neutral stability and the amplitude of the\nunstable T\u2013S modes at these points are presented in \u00a73 for both the parabolic body and\nthe Rankine body. Some comments and concluding remarks are given in \u00a74.\n2. Formulation\n2.1. Formulation of the parabolized stability equation\nIn this section we derive the parabolized stability equation valid within the boundary\nlayer on a two\u2013dimensional body with a rounded leading edge. We use the coordinate\nsystem (x\u2217, y\u2217) where the dimensional coordinates x\u2217 and y\u2217 are measured along the body\nand normal to the body respectively. Introducing dimensionless quantities based on the\nvelocity scale U\u221e and the fixed length scale \u03b40 = (\u03bdx\u22170\/U\u221e)\n1\/2 the vorticity equation can\nbe written in terms of the stream function \u03a8 as(\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u2212 1\nR0\n\u22072 + \u2202\u03a8\n\u2202y\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n\u2212 \u2202\u03a8\n\u2202x\n\u2202\n\u2202y\n)\n\u22072\u03a8 = 0, (2.1)\nwhere\nR0 =\nU\u221e\u03b40\n\u03bd\n. (2.2)\nHere \u03bd is the kinematic viscosity, x\u22170 is the dimensional distance along the body at which\nthe PSE analysis is started and R0 is the Reynolds number based upon the length scale\n\u03b40. The Reynolds number R0 is assumed to be large so that the flow field is inviscid\nand irrotational everywhere, except in the vicinity of the surface of the body. The corre-\nsponding non\u2013dimensional position that we start our analysis is x0 = R0.\nThe stream function is split into a steady base flow part \u03a8B(x, y) and a time dependent\ndisturbance part \u03c8(x, y, t)\u001c \u03a8B(x, y), and we assume that at the edge of the boundary\nlayer, the mean flow has a slip velocity Uf (x) parallel to the surface of the body. The\nequation for the disturbance quantity \u03c8 is obtained by substituting \u03a8 = \u03a8B + \u03c8 into\n(2.1) and subtracting off the equation satisfied by the mean flow (Bertolotti et al. 1992).\nThe resulting equation for \u03c8 holds at leading order for the disturbance as long as the\ncurvature of the body is assumed to be small away from the vicinity of the leading edge\n(Rosenhead 1963; Turner 2005). To make a comparison with the analysis in the leading\nedge region, formulated in \u00a72.2, we change our coordinate system to\n\u03be =\n\u222b x\n0\nUf (x\u2032)dx\u2032, N = R\n1\/2\n0 Uf (\u03be)(2\u03be)\n\u22121\/2y, (2.3)\nwhich remain in the streamwise and normal directions to the body respectively (Nichols\n2001; Turner 2005).\nWe seek a solution for the disturbance stream function \u03c8(\u03be,N, t) in the form of a\nspatially evolving two\u2013dimensional wave with constant frequency \u03c9, local streamwise\nAnalysis of the unstable T\u2013S mode on bodies with a rounded leading edge 5\nwave number \u03b1(\u03be) and a complex mode shape \u03c6(\u03be,N) of the form\n\u03c8(\u03be,N, t) = \u03c6(\u03be,N) exp (i (\u03b8(\u03be)\u2212 \u03c9t)) + complex conjugate, (2.4)\nwhere\nd\u03b8\nd\u03be\n= \u03b1(\u03be).\nThe amplitude of the disturbance is assumed to be sufficiently small so that the non\u2013\nlinear terms can be neglected, |\u03c8| \u001c 1. This condition suffices for the calculations in this\nstudy because we are only interested in calculating the amplitude of the unstable T\u2013S\nmode up to the lower branch neutral stability point and nonlinear effects only become\nsignificant downstream of this point if the initial disturbance amplitude is above some\nthreshold. It is possible to calculate amplitudes up to the upper branch neutral stability\npoint, but the nonlinear form of the PSE, which is discussed in Bertolotti et al. (1992),\nshould then be considered. The main assumption in the formulation of the PSE is that\nthe streamwise variation of \u03b1 and \u03c6 is sufficiently small (Bertolotti et al. 1992; Turner &\nHammerton 2006), that is \u22022\u03b1\/\u2202\u03be2, \u22022\u03c6\/\u2202\u03be2 and the product of first derivatives \u2202\u03b1\/\u2202\u03be\nand \u2202\u03c6\/\u2202\u03be are O(R\u221220 ), and hence negligible if we retain only terms of O(R\n\u22121\n0 ) in our\nanalysis. This assumption has been seen to hold in numerical computations (Morkovin\n1985), and we have checked that these conditions hold for the values of R0 considered in\nthis paper.\nUsing these assumptions and retaining terms of O(R\u221210 ) leads to the derivation of the\nlinear PSE, which written in operator form is\n(L0 + L1 + L2)\u03c6+M1\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03be\n+\nd\u03b1\nd\u03be\nM2\u03c6 = 0, (2.5)\nwhere\nL0 = \u2212 1\nR0\n(\nR0D\n2\n2\u03be\n\u2212 \u03b12\n)2\n+\n(\ni\u03b1\nUf\n\u2202\u03a8B\n\u2202y\n\u2212 i\u03c9\nU2f\n)(\nR0D\n2\n2\u03be\n\u2212 \u03b12\n)\n\u2212 i\u03b1\nU3f\n\u22023\u03a8B\n\u2202y3\n, (2.6)\nL1 =\nR\n1\/2\n0\n(2\u03be)1\/2U3f\n\u22023\u03a8B\n\u2202x\u2202y2\nD \u2212 R\n1\/2\n0\n(2\u03be)1\/2Uf\n\u2202\u03a8B\n\u2202x\n(\nR0D\n3\n2\u03be\n\u2212 \u03b12D\n)\n, (2.7)\nL2 =\n(\nU \u2032f\nUf\n\u2212 1\n2\u03be\n)\nN\n(\n1\nUf\n\u2202\u03a8B\n\u2202y\n(\nR0D\n3\n2\u03be\n\u2212 3\u03b12D\n)\n+\n2\u03c9\u03b1\nU2f\nD \u2212 1\nU3f\n\u22023\u03a8B\n\u2202x\u2202y2\nD\n)\n+\n2R0\nUf\n\u2202\u03a8B\n\u2202y\n(\nU \u2032f\n2\u03beUf\n\u2212 1\n4\u03be2\n)\nD2 +\n\u03c9\u03b1U \u2032f\nU3f\n\u2212 3U\n\u2032\nf\u03b1\n2\nU2f\n\u2202\u03a8B\n\u2202y\n, (2.8)\nM1 =\n1\nUf\n\u2202\u03a8B\n\u2202y\n(\nR0D\n2\n2\u03be\n\u2212 3\u03b12\n)\n+\n2\u03c9\u03b1\nU2f\n\u2212 1\nU3f\n\u22023\u03a8B\n\u2202x\u2202y2\n, (2.9)\nM2 =\n\u03c9\nU2f\n\u2212 3\u03b1\nUf\n\u2202\u03a8B\n\u2202y\n, (2.10)\nand D \u2261 \u2202\/\u2202N . For a semi\u2013infinite flat plate, Uf = 1 and the system of equations\n(2.5\u20132.10) is equivalent to the governing equations in Turner & Hammerton (2006).\nIn (2.4) there is ambiguity in the choice of functions \u03b1(\u03be) and \u03c6(\u03be,N). To resolve this\nwe introduce a normalization condition on \u03c6 which restricts the rapid variation in the \u03be\ndirection. We define this normalization condition as\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03c6\u03be\u03c6\n\u2020dN = 0, (2.11)\n6 M. R. Turner and P. W. Hammerton\nwhere \u2020 denotes the complex conjugate. This normalization condition is equivalent to\u222b \u221e\n0\n|\u03c8|2 dN = C exp (\u22122Im(\u03b8(\u03be))) ,\nwhich shows that the majority of the streamwise variation with \u03be is now in the wavenum-\nber \u03b1(\u03be). This normalization condition minimizes the streamwise change \u2202\u03c6\/\u2202\u03be in a\nweighted sense over the N\u2212domain, which also keeps \u2202\u03c6\/\u2202\u03be small in accordance with\nour initial assumption. Other normalization conditions could be implemented (Herbert\n1993; Andersson et al. 1998), however we find this one to be most desirable because it\ngives results which are in excellent agreement with those for a boundary layer on a flat\nplate (Turner & Hammerton 2006). Although the formulation does not prove that a so-\nlution satisfying (2.11) exists, the agreement of the PSE results with those of Goldstein\n(1983) for a flat plate justifies this choice (Turner & Hammerton 2006; Turner 2005).\nEquations (2.5) and (2.11) are solved numerically via a spectral collocation technique\nusing Chebyshev polynomials. This method is equivalent to that described in Turner &\nHammerton (2006) and Bertolotti et al. (1992) and so the reader is directed to these for\nmore details.\nIn this study we are only interested in the propagation of the eigenmodes from the\nleading\u2013edge region through the Orr\u2013Sommerfeld region, hence we solve (2.5) with ho-\nmogeneous boundary conditions, and an upstream boundary condition stipulated by\n\u03c6(\u03be0, N) = F\u02c6 (N), \u03b1(\u03be0) = \u03b10, (2.12)\nwhere \u03be0 is the dimensionless starting position for the analysis along the surface of the\nbody. These conditions depend upon the form of the boundary layer at \u03be0 and the inter-\naction of the free\u2013stream disturbance with the boundary layer upstream of this point.\n2.2. Leading edge receptivity analysis\nNear to the leading edge of the body, the PSE is no longer valid because the boundary\nlayer grows rapidly in this region and the assumption that \u03b1\u03be\u03be, \u03c6\u03be\u03be and \u03b1\u03be\u03c6\u03be are small\nbreaks down. In this region we have a different balance of terms at leading order as\nopposed to \u00a72.1. The solution for the mode shape in this region has a three deck structure:\nthe bottom deck is a Stokes layer solution where viscosity is important, the solution in\nthis deck satisfies the no\u2013slip condition at the wall. An outer inviscid region occurs outside\nthe boundary layer and the solution here tends to zero for large N . Between these two\nlayers is the main inviscid layer within the boundary layer where the solution must match\nto the two other solutions in the appropriate limits.\nIn the leading edge receptivity region the slip velocity at the edge of the boundary\nlayer Us is assumed to have a steady part and a linear perturbation due to the harmonic\nexternal disturbance,\nUs(xR, t) = Uf (xR) + \u000f\u02c6Ud(xR)e\u2212it. (2.13)\nHere \u000f\u02c6\u001c 1, xR is the streamwise coordinate non\u2013dimensionalised by the acoustic length\nscale U\u221e\/\u03c9\u2217 and \u03c9\u2217 is the dimensional frequency of the small\u2013amplitude perturbation.\nWe define Re = \u000f\u22126 = U2\u221e\/(\u03bd\u03c9\n\u2217) to be the Reynolds number based on this acoustic\nlength scale, which is assumed to be large, so the parameter \u000f is small.\nWe seek a solution to the non\u2013dimensional form of (2.1), derived in the receptivity\nvariables (xR, yR), of\n\u03a8R =\n(2\u03beR)1\/2\nRe1\/2\n(\n\u03c61(\u03beR, NR) + \u03c62(\u03beR, NR)e\u2212it\n)\n,\nAnalysis of the unstable T\u2013S mode on bodies with a rounded leading edge 7\nwhere\n\u03beR =\n\u222b xR\n0\nUf (x\u2032)dx\u2032 and NR =\nUf (\u03beR)Re1\/2\n(2\u03beR)1\/2\nyR. (2.14)\nThe subscript R denotes that we are in the receptivity region of the body. Neglecting\nhigher order terms in inverse powers of Re and equating powers of \u000f\u02c6 we find that the\nsteady equation for \u03c61(\u03beR, NR) is\n\u03c61NRNRNR + \u03c61\u03c61NRNR = \u03b2(\u03beR)(\u03c6\n2\n1NR \u2212 1) + 2\u03beR(\u03c61NR\u03c61NR\u03beR \u2212 \u03c61NRNR\u03c61\u03beR), (2.15)\nwhere \u03b2(\u03beR) = 2\u03beRU\u22121f dUf\/d\u03beR is the mean pressure gradient along the surface of the\nbody. Equation (2.15) is solved with the boundary conditions \u03c61 = \u03c61NR = 0 on NR = 0\nand \u03c61NR \u2192 1 as NR \u2192\u221e. The unsteady flow component \u03c62(\u03beR, NR) satisfies\n\u03c62NRNRNR + \u03c62NRNR(\u03c61 + 2\u03beR\u03c61\u03beR) + \u03c62NR(i\u2126(\u03beR)\u2212 2\u03b2(\u03beR)\u03c61NR \u2212 2\u03beR\u03c61NR\u03beR)\n+ \u03c62\u03c61NRNR + 2\u03beR(\u03c61NRNR\u03c62\u03beR \u2212 \u03c61NR\u03c62NR\u03beR) = h(\u03beR), (2.16)\nwhere \u2126(\u03beR) = 2\u03beR\/U2f and the boundary conditions are \u03c62 = \u03c62NR = 0 on NR = 0 and\n\u03c62NR \u2192 Ud(\u03beR)\/Uf (\u03beR) as NR \u2192\u221e. The function h(\u03beR) is determined by the unsteady\nforcing of the boundary layer by the free\u2013stream disturbance. Equation (2.16) is known\nas the linearised unsteady boundary layer equation (LUBLE).\nWe assume that far downstream (xR \u2212\u2192 \u221e) the steady form of the slip velocity\nUf (xR) acts parallel and symmetric to the surface of the body. Thus the asymptotic\nform of Uf (xR) in this limit is\nUf (xR) = 1 +\n\u03b31\nxR\n+\n\u03b32\nx2R\n+O(x\u22123R ), (2.17)\nor using (2.14)\nUf (\u03beR) = 1 +\n\u03b31\n\u03beR\n+\n\u03b321 ln(\u03beR)\n\u03be2R\n+\n\u03b32\n\u03be2R\n+O(\u03be\u22123R ln\n2(\u03beR)), (2.18)\nwhere \u03b31 and \u03b32 are real constants.\nIn this limit the steady solution for \u03c61(\u03beR, NR) can be determined as\n\u03c61(\u03beR, NR) = f \u2212 1.2023\u03b31(NRf \u2032 \u2212 f) ln(\u03beR)\n\u03beR\n+\nD(NRf \u2032 \u2212 f) + \u03b31E(NR)\n\u03beR\n+O(\u03be\u22121.887R ),\n(2.19)\nwhere f(NR) is the Blasius function which satisfies\nf \u2032\u2032\u2032 + ff \u2032\u2032 = 0, f(0) = f \u2032(0) = 0, f \u2032 \u2212\u2192 1 as NR \u2212\u2192\u221e,\nand the prime denotes d\/dNR. The constant D in (2.19) is calculated numerically and\ndepends upon the curvature of the body (Hammerton & Kerschen 1996; Nichols 2001;\nTurner 2005). The function E(NR) is also calculated numerically by solving the differ-\nential equation\nE\u2032\u2032\u2032 + fE\u2032\u2032 + 2f \u2032E\u2032 \u2212 f \u2032E = \u22122(f \u2032 \u2212 1)\u2212 2.4046ff \u2032\u2032,\nwith E = E\u2032 = E\u2032\u2032 = 0 at NR = 0. The correction terms to (2.19) correspond to\nnon\u2013integer eigenvalues of (2.15) (Libby & Fox 1963).\nIn the limit of large \u03beR the solution for \u03c62 consists of a Stokes solution which depends\non the form of the unsteady disturbance Ud(\u03beR), and a sum of asymptotic eigenmodes\nwhich satisfy (2.16) with h(\u03beR) = 0 and with homogeneous boundary conditions (Lam\n& Rott 1960, 1993; Brown & Stewartson 1973). The precise relationship between these\ntwo sets of eigenmodes is unclear (Hammerton 1999), however the Lam\u2013Rott eigenmodes\n8 M. R. Turner and P. W. Hammerton\nare important in receptivity as they exhibit the wavelength shortening needed to convert\nthe long\u2013wavelength free\u2013stream disturbances to short\u2013wavelength disturbances in the\nboundary layer. Nichols (2001) calculates the form of these Lam\u2013Rott eigenmodes for a\ngeneral body with an asymptotic steady\u2013slip velocity as in (2.17). The jth eigenmode\ntakes the form\n\u03c8LRj (\u03beR, NR) = (2\u03beR)\n1\/2\u03c62(\u03beR, NR) = Cj\u03be\n\u03c4j\nR g0(\u03beR, NR)e\nTj(\u03beR), (2.20)\nwhere Cj is an arbitrary constant dependent on the curvature of the body known as the\nreceptivity coefficient. The constants \u03c4j are expressed in terms of \u03c1j and \u03b31 where \u03c1j is\nthe jth root of the equation Ai\u2032(\u2212\u03c1j) = 0 and Ai\u2032 is the derivative of the Airy function\nof the first kind. The function Tj(\u03beR) is given by\nTj(\u03beR) = \u2212e\n\u2212ipi\/4(2\u03beR)3\/2\nU \u20320\u03c1\n3\/2\nj\n(\n1\n3\n+ 1.2023\u03b31\nln(\u03beR)\n\u03beR\n+ (\u22125.4046\u03b31 \u2212D) 1\n\u03beR\n)\n+O(\u03be\u22120.387R ),\nwhere U \u20320 = f\n\u2032\u2032(0) = 0.4696. In this study we are only interested in the propagation\nof the first of these eigenmodes as it is this mode which matches onto the spatially\ngrowing T\u2013S mode in the Orr\u2013Sommerfeld region (Goldstein 1983), hence \u03c11 = 1.0188\nand \u03c41 = \u22120.6921 \u2212 7.9508\u03b31i (Nichols 2001; Turner 2005). The function g0(\u03beR, NR)\ncan be represented in the leading edge region as a composite of the three deck solutions\n(Turner & Hammerton 2006; Turner 2005) and written as\ng0(\u03beR, NR) = \u03be\u03c41R\n(\n(2\u03beR)1\/2f \u2032(NR) + U \u20320\n\u222bM\n0\n(M \u2212 M\u02dc)Ai(z\u02dc)dM\u02dc\u222b\u221e\n0\nAi(z\u02dc)dM\u02dc\n\u2212 U \u20320(2\u03beR)1\/2NR\n)\n\u00d7 exp\n(\n\u2212\u000f\n3\u221a2(1 + i)\u03beRNR\nU \u20320\u03b3\u02c6(\u03beR)\u03c1\n3\/2\n1\n)\n,(2.21)\nwhere\nM = (2\u03beR)1\/2\n(\n1\u2212 \u03b31\n\u03beR\n)\nN,\nz\u02dc = \u2212\u03c11 + \u03c1\u22121\/21 eipi\/4M\u02dc,\n\u03b3\u02c6 = 1\u2212 1.2023\u03b31 ln(\u03beR)\n\u03beR\n+ (D + 3\u03b31)\n1\n\u03beR\n+O(\u03be\u22121.887R ).\nEquation (2.20) with g0(\u03beR, NR) given by (2.21) is now used as the initial condition for\nthe PSE calculations where the PSE and receptivity variables are related to one another\nby\n\u03beR =\nR0\nRe\n\u03be and NR = N.\nHence we start our analysis for the PSE calculation at the scaled streamwise receptivity\nvariable \u03be\u02dc1 = \u03be\u02dc\n(0)\n1 where\n\u03be0 = R0 = \u000f\u22124U \u20320\n(\n\u03be\u02dc\n(0)\n1\n2\n)1\/2\n, \u03c9 =\nR0\nRe\n,\nand \u000f = Re\u22121\/6. The variable \u03be\u02dc1 = 2\u000f2\u03beR\/U \u203220 is introduced to make comparisons with\nthe works of Goldstein (1983) and Turner & Hammerton (2006) easier. Thus from (2.12)\nAnalysis of the unstable T\u2013S mode on bodies with a rounded leading edge 9\nand (2.20) the initial wavenumber is given by\n\u03b1(\u03be0) =\ni\u000f6R0e\n\u2212ipi\/4\n(\n\u03be\u02dc\n(0)\n1\n)1\/2\n\u03c1\n3\/2\n1\n(\n1 + 1.2023\u03b31\nln(\u03be0)\n\u03be0\n\u2212 (D + 3\u03b31) 1\n\u03be0\n)\n, (2.22)\nand the form of the base flow is given by\n\u03a8B =\n(2\u03be)1\/2\nR\n1\/2\n0\n(\nf \u2212 1.2023\u03b31Re\nR0\n(NfN \u2212 f) ln(R0\u03be\/Re)\n\u03be\n+\nRe\nR0\nD(NfN \u2212 f) + \u03b31E(N)\n\u03be\n)\n+O(\u03be\u22121.387).\nAlternative forms for the initial condition to the PSE include using the most unstable\neigenmode of the Orr\u2013Sommerfeld equation or the local PSE at \u03be = \u03be0. However the\nadvantage of the receptivity condition is that it contains all the information required to\ngive the amplitude of the unstable T\u2013S mode as it enters the Orr\u2013Sommerfeld region,\nand hence we have the complete T\u2013S mode amplitude at the lower branch point. This is\ndiscussed in more detail in Turner & Hammerton (2006) for the case of a flat plate.\n3. Results\nIn this section we present results giving the position of the lower branch neutral sta-\nbility point and the amplitude of the unstable T\u2013S mode at this point for bodies with a\nslip velocity which has the form given in (2.17). It is noted from (2.20) that to have the\ncomplete amplitude of the unstable T\u2013S mode as it enters the Orr\u2013Sommerfeld region\nwe need to know the value of the receptivity coefficient |C1| which varies as a function\nof the nose curvature of the body. Hence in this section we present results for bodies\nfor which the value of |C1| has been calculated. Therefore we consider a parabolic body\n(Hammerton & Kerschen 1996) and the Rankine body (Nichols 2001). In the remainder\nof this section we use the superscripts P and R to represent the parabola and Rankine\nbody respectively.\nThe calculation of the position of the neutral stability point can be made easier by\nplacing all the wave amplitude information into one single growth rate function. This is\nachieved by splitting the amplitude function in (2.4) in the following way:\n\u03c6(\u03be,N) = \u03c6max(\u03be)\u03c6\u00af(\u03be,N),\nwhere the maximum value of \u03c6\u00af is 1. Thus the stream function is given by\n\u03c8 = \u03c6\u00af(\u03be,N) exp(i\u03b8\u02dc(\u03be)\u2212 \u03c9t) + complex conjugate, with d\u03b8\u02dc\nd\u03be\n= G(\u03be),\nwhere all the wave amplitude information is now contained in the growth rate G(\u03be),\nwhich when written as a function of the receptivity variable \u03beR, has the form\nG(\u03beR) =\nRe\nR0\n(\ni\u03b1+\n1\n\u03c6max\n\u2202\u03c6max\n\u2202\u03be\n)\n. (3.1)\nThe lower branch neutral stability point can now defined as the position where Im(G) = 0.\nAlthough G(\u03beR) is defined as a function of the streamwise variable \u03beR, we usually display\nour results in terms of the scaled receptivity variable \u03be\u02dc1 = 2\u000f2\u03beR\/U \u203220 as this makes\ncomparisons with the flat plate analysis of Goldstein (1983) and Turner & Hammerton\n(2006) easier.\nIn this study we are interested in calculating the amplitude of the unstable T\u2013S mode\n\u03c81, from (2.20), which is achieved by integrating the growth rate G(\u03beR) from a position\n10 M.

The value of \u03be\nLE\nR can take any\nvalue in the region close the leading edge where the downstream amplitude is independent\nof the value of \u03beLER . This region has been shown to exist for a flat plate by Turner &\nHammerton (2006). Thus the amplitude of \u03c81 at the branch I neutral stability point can\nbe written as \u2223\u2223\u03c8I1\u2223\u2223 =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223C1\u03c8LR1 (\u03beLER ) exp\n(\u222b \u03beIR\n\u03beLER\nG(x)dx\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 . (3.2)\nThroughout this study we shall refer to\n\u2223\u2223\u03c8I1\u2223\u2223 as the T\u2013S mode amplitude at the lower\nbranch neutral stability point, and\n\u2223\u2223C\u221211 \u03c8I1\u2223\u2223 as the eigenmode amplitude at this point.\nAn important factor needed in order to use this PSE method, is the existence of a\nmatching region between the leading edge asymptotic result and the result in the Orr\u2013\nSommerfeld region. This was shown to exist for a flat plate in Turner & Hammerton\n(2006) for sufficiently small \u000f and figure 2 shows that the same this true for the parabola\nwhere S = rn\u03c9\u2217\/U\u221e is the Strouhal number and corresponds to the dimensionless nose\nradius of the parabola. The figure shows Re(G(\u03be\u02dc1)) for two nose radii and for (a) \u000f = 0.05\nand \u000f = 0.1. The leading edge solution is given by (3.1) with \u03b1 replaced by (2.22) and\nthe local PSE result is a solution of (2.5) about \u03be\u02dc1 for each \u03be\u02dc1. For more details on the\nlocal PSE solution see Bertolotti et al. (1992) and Turner & Hammerton (2006). The\nlocal PSE is an indication of how close to the nose of the body the PSE solution can be\nbefore the PSE code fails converge to the correct growth rate because of initial transients\nin the solution (Turner & Hammerton 2006). Figure 2(a) shows that a clear matching\nregion exists, and thus for small values of \u000f = Re\u22121\/6 the PSE can be started back in\nthe matching region near \u03beLER , so the growth rate is defined over the whole domain of\nintegration. However for larger values of \u000f the PSE code cannot be initiated back in the\nmatching region as can be seen in figure 2(b). We overcome this problem by patching\nAnalysis of the unstable T\u2013S mode on bodies with a rounded leading edge 11\nthe growth rate back to \u03beLER using the same method as in Turner & Hammerton (2006).\nThis method involves fixing the value of the growth rate and its derivative using both\nthe leading edge solution and the PSE solution, and then patching the region in between\nby a cubic polynomial with complex coefficients. For more information on this patching\nmethod and its validity see Turner & Hammerton (2006). Care was taken to ensure that\nthe wave amplitude downstream was independent of the step size chosen and also not\nsensitive to the choice of streamwise position at which the PSE solution was patched to\nthe receptivity analysis.\nThe parabolic body is described in terms of the Strouhal number, while the Rankine\nbody is described in terms of the dimensionless parameter A = 2rn\u03c9\u2217\/3U\u221e which is\nlinked to the dimensionless nose radius 3A\/2 (Turner 2005). Thus the two bodies have\nthe same nose radius if S = 3A\/2. The inviscid flow around the parabolic body is\ncalculated using slender body theory (Hammerton & Kerschen 1996), while the inviscid\nflow around the Rankine body is determined by complex potential theory (Nichols 2001).\nThe form of the slip velocity Uf at the edge of the boundary layer for these bodies are\nUPf (\u03beR) =\n(2\u03beR)1\/2\n(2\u03beR + S)1\/2\n, (3.3)\nURf (yc) =\n(\n1 +\nA2\ny2c\nsin2\n(yc\nA\n)\n\u2212 A\nyc\nsin\n(\n2yc\nA\n))1\/2\n, (3.4)\nwhere yc is the Cartesian y\u2013coordinate. The large \u03beR form of each slip velocity can be\ncalculated as\nUPf = 1\u2212\nS\n4\u03beR\n+\n3S2\n32\u03be2R\n+O(\u03be\u22123R ), (3.5)\nURf = 1 +\nA\n\u03beR\n+\nA2 ln(\u03beR)\n\u03be2R\n+\nA2\nx2R\n+O(\u03be\u22123R ln\n2(\u03beR)), (3.6)\nthus comparing these expressions with (2.18) we see that \u03b3P1 = \u2212S\/4 and \u03b3R1 = A. The\nrespective values of the constant D in (2.19) can thus be calculated as\nDP =\nS\n2\n(\n2.075\u2212 0.60115 ln\n(\nS\n2\n))\n, (3.7)\nDR = A (\u22124.71125 + 1.2023 ln(A)) , (3.8)\nfor the parabolic and Rankine body respectively.\nFrom (3.3) and (3.4) the mean pressure gradient \u03b2(xR) can be calculated and figure 3\nplots both (a) Uf (xR) and (b) \u03b2(xR) for the parabolic and Rankine bodies with the same\nnose radius (A = 0.1, S = 0.15). These quantities are plotted as functions of xR because\nthis variable is independent of the curvature of the body, whereas \u03beR is a function of A\nand S (see (2.14)). The parabolic body has a slip velocity which is always less than one\nand this gives a favourable (or positive) pressure gradient along the surface of the body.\nThe Rankine body has a slip velocity which rises above one before asymptoting to one as\nxR \u2212\u2192\u221e and this gives an adverse (or negative) pressure gradient along the majority of\nthe body\u2019s surface. The absolute value of the pressure gradient on the Rankine body is\nlarger than on the parabolic body for xR \u2265 1 and this affects the position of the neutral\nstability point as we shall see later.\nWe now consider numerical results for three values of the Reynolds number, corre-\nsponding to \u000f = 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2.

The middle value of \u000f is too large for\nexperimental data, but it is comfortably in the range of Reynolds numbers that could\nbe used in a DNS model to verify our results. The largest value of \u000f is in the range of\nvalues that could be considered by experimentalists and DNS simulations. This value of\n\u000f corresponds to a dimensionless frequency of F = \u03c9\u2217\u03bd\/U2\u221e = \u000f\n6 = 64\u00d7 10\u22126 which lies\nin the tail of the neutral stability curve (see Haddad & Corke (1998)). This value is also\nat the lower edge of the values used in the DNS study of Haddad & Corke. The top of\nthe neutral stability curve tail have values of \u000f . 0.25 and so the values of \u000f considered\nin this paper give a good understanding of the structure behind TS wave propagation on\na body with non\u2013zero nose radius.\nFigures 4 and 5 plot the position of the lower branch neutral stability point for both\nthe parabolic body and the Rankine body respectively for the three values of \u000f = 0.05,\n0.1 and 0.2. In each figure we plot the neutral stability point as both a function of\n\u03be\u02dc1 = 2\u000f2\u03beR\/U \u203220 and x\u02dc1 = 2\u000f\n2xR\/U\n\u20322\n0 as the latter is independent of the nose curvature.\nThe small bumps occurring in the solution are due to numerical error, and appear to\ndiminish as \u000f is increased because the scale of the figures increases as \u000f is increased.\nFigure 4 shows that the favourable pressure gradient along the surface of the parabolic\nbody gives a lower branch neutral stability point which is further downstream than the\ncorresponding flat plate value (S = 0). For the larger value of \u000f = 0.2 in figure 4(c),\nthe relative position of the neutral stability point moves even further downstream. The\nadverse pressure gradient on the Rankine body on the other hand gives a neutral stability\npoint positioned nearer to the nose of the body as the nose radius (3A\/2) is increased.\nThis is shown in figure 5. Again, as \u000f is increased from 0.05 in figure 5(a) to 0.2 in 5(c)\nthe relative position of the neutral point moves further downstream when compared to\nthe flat plate value.\nA comparison of the deviation away from the flat plate neutral stability point\n\u2223\u2223x\u02dc1 \u2212 x\u02dcFP1 \u2223\u2223\nfor both bodies is given in figure 6. For the values of \u000f considered here, x\u02dcFP1 = 3.402, 3.946\nand 6.359 for \u000f = 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 respectively. Due to the magnitude of the adverse\npressure gradient on the Rankine body being larger than that of the parabolic body at\nthe same streamwise position (see figure 3), we note that the neutral stability point on\nthe Rankine body is displaced further from the flat plate value than the parabolic body\nfor the same nose radius. As \u000f increases the difference in displacement from the flat plate\nvalue increases between the two bodies.\nHaving considered the position of the point of neutral stability, we now consider the\nAnalysis of the unstable T\u2013S mode on bodies with a rounded leading edge 13\n(a)\n 3.4\n 3.41\n 3.42\n 3.43\n 3.44\n 3.45\n 3.46\n 0  0.05  0.1  0.15  0.2  0.25  0.3\nx\n~\n1\n~\u03be1\nS (b)\n 3.9\n 3.95\n 4\n 4.05\n 4.1\n 4.15\n 4.2\n 0  0.05  0.1  0.15  0.2  0.25  0.3S\n~\u03be\n1\nx\n~\n1\n(c)\n 6.3\n 6.4\n 6.5\n 6.6\n 6.7\n 6.8\n 6.9\n 7\n 7.1\n 7.2\n 0  0.05  0.1  0.15  0.2  0.25  0.3S\n\u03be~\n1\nx1\n~\nFigure 4.

In figures 7 and 8 we plot log plots of the amplitude\nof the unstable T\u2013S mode\n\u2223\u2223\u03c8I1\u2223\u2223 defined in (2.20) at the lower branch (branch I) neutral\nstability point along with the corresponding amplitude of the eigenmode\n\u2223\u2223C\u221211 \u03c8I1\u2223\u2223. The\nresults for small \u000f have unphysically small amplitudes, however we merely use these small\n\u000f values to study the underlying mathematical structure of the solution, rather than for\ncomparison with DNS or experiments. These small amplitudes suggest that the leading\nedge receptivity may be dominated by another receptivity mechanism, such as acoustic\nwave interaction with surface roughness elements, but this requires further analysis. For\nthe parabolic body in figure 7 we see that the amplitude of the eigenmode at lower branch\u2223\u2223C\u221211 \u03c8I1\u2223\u2223 decreases as S increases for all the values of \u000f considered. When we include the\neffect of the receptivity coefficient C1 the overall amplitude of the T\u2013S mode\n\u2223\u2223\u03c8I1\u2223\u2223, decays\neven faster. However, Hammerton & Kerschen (1996) found that the Strouhal number\nS = 0.025, gives a receptivity coefficient |C1| that is larger than the flat plate value.\nFor the smallest value of \u000f considered here, \u000f = 0.05, the decay rate of the eigenmode\nis large enough so that the T\u2013S mode amplitude still decreases from the flat plate value\nfor S = 0.025, but for sufficiently small \u000f it is likely that there will be a range of S for\nwhich the T\u2013S mode amplitude at lower branch is larger than for the flat place case. This\nremains an area of future research as the numerical study of Haddad & Corke (1998)\ndoes not show an increase in T\u2013S mode amplitude above the flat plate value either, but\nit is not clear if they were in the correct parameter range to see this behaviour.

The actual receptivity coefficient\n|C1| for the Rankine body tends to zero much faster than for the parabolic body, due to\nthe adverse pressure gradient and so this gives a much smaller range of nose radii with\nnon\u2013zero receptivity coefficient available to us to study (Nichols 2001). The resulting\nT\u2013S mode and eigenmode amplitudes for the Rankine body can be seen in the log plot in\nfigure 8. The amplitude of the eigenmode appears to have almost an exponential growth\nin A, but due to the variation of the receptivity coefficient with A, the amplitude of the\nT\u2013S mode has a double maximum appearance as a function of A. For the \u000f = 0.05 case\nin figure 8(a), this double maximum is very clear, with maxima around A = 0.015 and\nA = 0.055, and the second maxima is almost a factor of 10 larger than the first. The case\n\u000f = 0.1 in 8(b) has a slightly different appearance, because the rate of increase of the\neigenmode amplitude is smaller than the \u000f = 0.05 case, while the values of the receptivity\ncoefficients remain unchanged. Hence in this case the first maximum of the T\u2013S mode\namplitude is closer to A = 0 and in fact on the log scale, the amplitude appears almost\nconstant at the flat plate value A = 0 up to A = 0.015. There is still another maximum\naround A = 0.05, but the relative size of this maximum compared to the first one is\nmuch smaller than for the \u000f = 0.05 case, and is only a factor of 1.8 times larger.

For this value of \u000f the T\u2013S mode\namplitude is seen to decay away from A = 0, and the second maximum which occurs\naround A = 0.04 has a lower magnitude than the one at A = 0. Therefore as \u000f increases\nthe growth of the eigenmode with respect to A decreases, and hence for the \u000f = 0.05\ncase, we find the two maxima are larger than the flat plate value, whereas for \u000f = 0.2,\nthe first maximum now corresponds to the flat plate value, and the second maximum\nhas a value lower than the flat plate value. Thus we expect that experimental studies on\na Rankine body will not produce a maximum value greater than the flat plate value for\nany nose radius, because typical Reynolds numbers in experiments give \u000f > 0.2. However\nthe experiment should still give a second increase in the T\u2013S mode amplitude at a larger\nnose radii.\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\nWe have formulated a method which uses the parabolized stability equation (PSE)\nto march the asymptotic eigenmodes at the leading edge, formed from the interaction\nof the free\u2013stream with the boundary layer, through the Orr\u2013Sommerfeld region of the\nbody. This method is valid on bodies with a rounded leading edge, where the steady slip\nvelocity at the edge of the boundary layer has the form\nUf = 1 +\n\u03b31\nxR\n+\n\u03b32\nx2R\n+O(x\u22123R ),\n16 M.

We presented lower branch neutral stability point calculations and amplitudes\nof the unstable T\u2013S mode at this point for a parabolic body and the Rankine body which\nboth satisfy the above property. For the parabolic body, which has a favourable pressure\ngradient along its surface, we found the lower branch point was positioned downstream\nof the flat plate value as the nose radius of curvature was increased, and the T\u2013S mode\namplitude at this point decreased with increasing nose radius. The Rankine body on the\nother hand has an adverse pressure gradient over most of the body which produces a\nneutral stability point positioned closer to the nose of the body when compared to the\nflat plate value. The unstable T\u2013S mode amplitude at this point has a double maximum\nstructure for sufficiently large values of the Reynolds number with both maxima greater\nthan the flat plate value. However for smaller Reynolds numbers the T\u2013S mode amplitude\ndecreased from the flat plate value for increasing nose radius, but still with a second\nmaximum value for larger nose radii.\nThe present work has revealed how the amplitude of the unstable T\u2013S mode at the\nlower branch neutral stability point is sensitive to leading edge geometry. This sensitivity\nis important when determining the position of boundary layer transition. In this paper\ncomparisons with the numerical study of Haddad & Corke (1998) were not possible\nbecause the only non\u2013zero nose radius considered by Haddad & Corke corresponds to\na Strouhal number S = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22123, which gives results almost indistinguishable from\nthe flat plate case (cf figure 16(a) from Haddad & Corke (1998) for a parabola with\nAnalysis of the unstable T\u2013S mode on bodies with a rounded leading edge 17\n(a)\n 1e-121\n 1e-120\n 1e-119\n 1e-118\n 0  0.01  0.02  0.03  0.04  0.05  0.06  0.07\nEigenmode\nT\u2212S Mode\nA (b)\n 1e-19\n 1e-18\n 1e-17\n 1e-16\n 1e-15\n 0  0.01  0.02  0.03  0.04  0.05  0.06  0.07A\nEigenmode\nT\u2212S Mode\n(c)\n 1e-06\n 1e-05\n 1e-04\n 0.001\n 0  0.01  0.02  0.03  0.04  0.05  0.06  0.07\nA\nT\u2212S Mode\nEigenmode\nFigure 8.

A\nselection of results with larger nose radii using the methods of Haddad & Corke would\nmake an excellent comparison with the parabola results presented in this paper. Although\ngeneral trends in behaviour have been identified in this paper, the results presented here\ndo not allow direct comparison with experiments which are typically conducted using\nmodified super ellipses. While the methods of the current paper can be extended to\ncover analysis of such bodies, a separate receptivity analysis of the leading edge region\nfor the new geometry must be completed in order to describe the transition process.\nAcknowledgments\nThe writing up of this work took place when the leading author was supported by the\nEPSRC grant EP\/D032202\/1.
