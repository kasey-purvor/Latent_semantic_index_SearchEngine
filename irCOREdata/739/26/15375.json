Both geochemical 51 \nsignatures are developed early in the history of a melt pulse, either in the source (high-Nb 52 \nbasalt) or during deep differentiation (adakite). Preservation of these distinctive geochemical 53 \nsignatures is favoured in settings that minimise (i) interaction with other, more copious melt 54 \ntypes, or (ii) subsequent differentiation in the shallow crust. Where found, the high-Nb basalt 55 \n\u2013 adakite association is a result of transport through favourable lithospheric conditions and 56 \nnot due to any link between their mantle sources. 57 \nKeywords: High-Nb basalt; Nb-enriched basalt; Sabah; Borneo; subduction; OIB; 58 \nmagmatism 59 \n1. Introduction 60 \nSubduction is an important process in generating new crust at the present time and may 61 \nhave played a crucial role in generating continental crust throughout much of Earth history 62 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 3  \n(Rudnick, 1995). Understanding subduction, and the crust that it produces, requires an 63 \nunderstanding of spatial and temporal variations of magmatic products generated both within 64 \nindividual subduction zones and between different subduction zones. A striking feature of 65 \nmagmatism in modern volcanic arcs is the marked depletion of high field strength elements 66 \n(HFSE, such as Nb, Zr and Ti) relative to other elements with similar compatibilities. This 67 \ndepletion is thought to result from differential transport of HFSE compared to other elements 68 \nduring recycling from the slab to the mantle wedge (Thirlwall et al., 1994). Many subduction-69 \nrelated basalts also possess low absolute concentrations of Nb. 70 \nAlthough common, relative depletion of HFSE is not ubiquitous in arc magmatism. Several 71 \nsubduction zones have generated basaltic magma in which Nb, and most other incompatible 72 \nelements, are abundant and in which there is negligible depletion of HFSE relative to 73 \nelements with similar compatibility. Reagan and Gill (1989) introduced the term \u201chigh-Nb 74 \nbasalt\u201d to describe such rocks from the Costa Rican volcano Turrialba that contain 36ppm 75 \nNb which is not depleted relative to Light Rare Earth Elements (LREE), such as La, or Large 76 \nIon Lithophile Elements (LILE). For example, the value of (Nb\/La)n, the Nb\/La ratio 77 \nnormalised to the value for normal mid-ocean ridge basalt (N-MORB), is 0.91 in Turrialba 78 \nhigh-Nb basalt, while values range from 0.33 to 0.42 in more typical arc-related magmatism 79 \nfrom the same volcano. Sajona et al. (1994) subsequently used the term \u201cNb-enriched 80 \nbasalt\u201d for basaltic rocks from Mindanao, the Philippines, containing 4-16ppm Nb and with 81 \n(Nb\/La)n ranging between 0.72 and 1.41. 82 \nTwo main mechanisms have been proposed that might generate high-Nb basalt in these and 83 \nother convergent margins. Reagan and Gill (1989) concluded that incompatible trace 84 \nelement enrichment is inherited from small-degree partial melts of an Ocean Island Basalt 85 \n(OIB)-like source, which then interact with high-degree partial melts of depleted upper 86 \nmantle. The OIB melts are undersaturated in rutile because they carry reduced C-O-H fluids 87 \nand so Nb is not depleted relative to elements with similar compatibility. This contrasts with 88 \ncontemporaneous, presumed rutile-saturated, calc-alkaline magmatism at the same volcanic 89 \ncentres. Variations on this theme, with or without contributions from subducted crust and 90 \nsediment, have been proposed for several locations (Storey et al., 1989; Leeman et al., 1990 91 \nand 2005; Richards et al., 1990; Petrone et al., 2003; Castillo et al., 2002 and 2007; Castillo, 92 \n2008; Petrone and Ferrari, 2008). 93 \nAn alternative group of models arises from the observation that several high-Nb basalt suites 94 \noccur in subduction zones where the subducting plate is young and, therefore, hot (Defant et 95 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 4  \nal., 1992). Based on the premise that young subducted slabs are prone to melting (Defant 96 \nand Drummond, 1990) and on the presence of putative slab melt magmatism in association 97 \nwith some high-Nb basalt occurrences, Defant et al. (1992) proposed that high-Nb basalt 98 \nmay be produced from mantle into which metasomatic, Nb-rich amphibole has been 99 \nintroduced by slab melt. This model has subsequently been applied to several high-Nb 100 \nbasalt occurrences (Sajona et al., 1994 and 1996; Kepezhinskas et al., 1995, 1996 and 101 \n1997; Escuder Viruete et al., 2007; G\u00f3mez-Tuena et al., 2007). 102 \nIn this contribution we discuss the origin of Plio-Pleistocene high-Nb basalt magmatism from 103 \nthe Semporna peninsula of Sabah, Malaysia in northeastern Borneo. This site lies at the 104 \nsouthern end of the Sulu Arc, an arcuate band of magmatism extending south-eastwards 105 \nfrom the Zamboanga peninsula in western Mindanao through the Sulu Islands, such as 106 \nBasilan and Jolo, towards NE Borneo (Fig. 1a). There is field and petrological evidence 107 \nwhich suggests that the Sulu Arc produced subduction-related magmatism during the 108 \nMiocene (Section 2.1). A deep trench (> 4800m) with high heat-flow lies to the north of the 109 \narc but Hamilton (1979) considered that this trench does not represent on-going subduction. 110 \nThere is little significant seismic activity currently associated with the Sulu Arc and 111 \ntomographic imaging provides no evidence for a subducted slab beneath the islands 112 \n(Spakman and Bijward, 1998; Rangin et al., 1999). Thus, although the term arc is 113 \nappropriate to the bathymetry of the system it should not be used to infer that subduction is 114 \nactive, or that Plio-Pleistocene magmatism was caused by subduction-related processes. 115 \nWe compare high-Nb magmatism from Sabah to magmatism in the rest of the Sulu Arc and 116 \nto magmatic suites found elsewhere in SE Asia to investigate the nature of the mantle 117 \nsource and the lithosphere beneath Sabah. Then we discuss the implications of our findings 118 \nfor understanding mechanisms that might generate high-Nb basalt. 119 \n2. Setting and Samples 120 \n2.1 Mio-Pliocene Magmatism 121 \nEurasia\u2019s eastern margin has interacted with the Pacific Plate throughout the Cenozoic 122 \ngenerating a complex assemblage of plate fragments (Fig. 1a). The basement of Sabah was 123 \nproduced through accretion of Cretaceous ophiolitic fragments to the continental core of the 124 \nisland (Hall, 2002). From the Paleogene until the Early Miocene, southward-directed 125 \nsubduction of the proto-China Sea produced an accretionary margin in northern Borneo. The 126 \nlatter stages of this convergence occurred as the South China Sea Basin was opening to the 127 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 5  \nnorth. K-Ar analyses obtained Middle to Late Miocene (12.9-9 Ma, Rangin et al., 1990; 128 \nBellon and Rangin, 1991) or Middle Miocene (18.8-14.4 Ma, Swauger et al., 1995) ages for 129 \nNeogene magmatism in the Semporna and neighbouring Dent peninsulas, although these 130 \ndates are uncertain because they were determined on whole rock samples that may have 131 \nbeen subject to tropical weathering. The petrography and geochemistry of this magmatism is 132 \nconsistent with genesis in an island arc (Bellon & Rangin, 1991; Hutchison et al., 2000, 133 \nChiang, 2002) but the lack of tomographic evidence for dipping slabs, either modern or 134 \nancient (Spakman and Bijward, 1998; Rangin et al., 1999), has complicated efforts to 135 \ndetermine the polarity of Neogene subduction. Hall (2002) used the geology of Sabah to 136 \ninfer that this subduction was directed towards the northwest. Chiang (2002) investigated 137 \nthis further by examining incompatible trace element ratios of Neogene arc magmatism 138 \nthroughout SE Sabah and also concluded that Celebes Sea crust was subducted beneath 139 \nthe Sulu Arc towards the northwest. 140 \n2.2 Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 141 \nThe youngest phase of magmatism in Sabah is the subject of this work. Plio-Pleistocene 142 \nbasalt and basaltic andesite lavas, cinder cones and occasional dykes are found at Tawau 143 \nand Mostyn on the Semporna Peninsula (Fig. 1). At Tawau eruptions occurred through 144 \ncinder cones while the Mostyn eruptions mainly occurred along N130\u00b0E-trending fissures. 145 \nThe ages of these rocks are poorly known. Lim and Hen (1985) suggested ages of 27 Ka or 146 \nyounger, while Rangin et al. (1990) obtained whole rock K-Ar dates of 2.8-3.1 Ma. However, 147 \nBellon and Rangin (1991) concede that the K-Ar data remain suspect, concluding that 148 \nvolcanism injected along the fissures is probably very young and that these faults are still 149 \nactive. 150 \nPlio-Pleistocene lavas from Tawau are aphyric to moderately (<20%) porphyritic basalts and 151 \nbasaltic andesites. Fresh plagioclase and olivine are the most abundant phenocryst phases 152 \nin the basalts with magnetite and clinopyroxene occurring as minor phases in the 153 \ngroundmass. In the basaltic andesites, clinopyroxene is the most abundant phenocryst 154 \nphase. Plagioclase is also the most abundant phenocryst phase in the Mostyn suite. Large, 155 \nfresh phenocrysts of olivine are found in the most basic rocks and small orthopyroxene 156 \nphenocrysts are the most common mafic phenocryst in more silicic rocks, although the total 157 \nphenocryst content is particularly low in the latter. Clinopyroxene is a minor phase in the 158 \nmatrix of most Mostyn lavas. 159 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 6  \n3. Techniques 160 \nXRF analyses were performed using a Philips PW1480 XRF spectrometer at Royal 161 \nHolloway, University of London. LOI was determined by heating the pre-dried sample at 162 \n1100\u00b0C for 20 minutes. Major element concentrations were analysed on fused discs of pre-163 \ndried sample mixed with pre-dried La2O3 Johnson-Mattey Spectroflux 105 (ratio sample:flux 164 \n= 1:6). Trace element (Ni, Cr, V, Sc, Cu, Zn, Cl, Ga, Pb, Sr, Ba, Zr, Nb, Th, Y, La, Ce and 165 \nNd) concentrations were determined on pressed power pellets with matrix corrections based 166 \non major element compositions. Reproducibility (2sd of six replicate preparations) of XRF 167 \ndata is reported in Table 1; based on 25-35 international standards accuracy is comparable 168 \nfor major elements and for trace elements where these have been analysed by isotope 169 \ndilution. 170 \nSr and Nd isotopic analyses were conducted at the Arthur Holmes Isotope Geochemistry 171 \nLaboratory at the University of Durham using a ThermoElectron Neptune multi-collector ICP-172 \nMS system. Details of the operating procedures and instrument configuration are given in 173 \nHandley et al. (2007). Measured values for the NBS 987 and J&M standards \u00b12SD error 174 \nduring the same runs as the Semporna samples were 0.710270\u00b118 (n=11) and 0.511101\u00b15 175 \n(n=15), respectively. Data are reported relative to NBS 987 and J&M standard values of 176 \n0.71024 (Thirlwall, 1991) and 0.511110 (Royse et al., 1998), respectively. Total procedural 177 \nblanks for Sr and Nd were determined by ICP-MS on a PerkinElmer ELAN 6000 quadrupole 178 \nICP-MS system at Durham University and were below 1.2 ng for Sr and 219 pg for Nd. 179 \nThese values are considered insignificant in relation to the quantity of Sr and Nd typically 180 \nprocessed from Semporna rocks. 181 \nPb isotope ratios were determined at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography following the 182 \nprocedure described in Janney and Castillo (1996; 1997). Rock powders were dissolved with 183 \na double-distilled, 2:1 mixture of concentrated HF:HNO3 acid in Teflon beakers. Lead was 184 \nseparated from sample solutions using small ion exchange columns in an HBr medium and 185 \nits isotopes were measured using a 9-collector, Micromass Sector 54 thermal ionization 186 \nmass spectrometer. Lead isotopes were fractionation corrected using the isotope values of 187 \nNBS 981 relative to those of Thirlwall (2000). Analytical uncertainties based on repeated 188 \nmeasurements of standards are \u00b1 0.008 for 206Pb\/204Pb and 207Pb\/204Pb and \u00b1 0.030 for 189 \n208Pb\/204Pb. Routine analytical blank was generally <30 pg of Pb. 190 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 7  \n4. Results 191 \nPlio-Pleistocene lavas from Tawau and Mostyn display limited ranges of SiO2 (49.44 to 192 \n56.56 wt.%) and MgO (4.36 to 7.66 wt.%). The Mostyn group are distinct from Tawau lavas 193 \nin having lower K2O and P2O5, and higher Fe2O3 and TiO2 at any value of MgO (Fig. 2). For 194 \nmost major elements there is a significant amount of scatter at any MgO content. No 195 \ncorrelations were found between major element concentrations and the modal abundance of 196 \nany phenocryst phase. For the suite, as a whole, there is a general increase in SiO2 with 197 \ndecreasing MgO, but most major elements show no simple variation with differentiation. This 198 \nis also apparent for incompatible trace elements (Fig. 3). The Tawau lavas can be divided 199 \ninto four sub-groups (PP1 to PP4) for which, at any concentration of MgO, the 200 \nconcentrations of K2O, P2O5, Sr, Nb, Rb and Ba all decrease in the order PP4 > PP3 > PP2 201 \n> Mostyn (Figs. 2 and 3). For Pb, Th, La, Ce and Nd a similar order exists but with PP2 lying 202 \nbetween PP3 and PP4. The PP1 group has a very restricted range in MgO but frequently 203 \nhas incompatible element concentrations similar to, or lying on an extension of, the PP2 204 \ntrend. 205 \nConcentrations of Ni (Fig. 3a) and Cr decrease with MgO as would be expected in magmas 206 \nproduced by differentiation of basaltic parents. In contrast, the majority of incompatible 207 \nelements in the Tawau sub-groups and Mostyn lavas show behaviour that is not consistent 208 \nwith their expected compatibility in basaltic magma. The concentrations of these elements 209 \nshould increase as MgO falls but concentrations of K2O, P2O5 and most other incompatible 210 \nelements show relatively little variation or pronounced decreases with decreasing MgO 211 \n(Figs. 2 and 3). This effect is particularly notable for P2O5 in the PP3 and Mostyn groups, 212 \nwhich could indicate crystallisation of apatite, however, Semporna lavas are more mafic than 213 \nwould be suitable for apatite saturation at these P2O5 concentrations in basalt or alkali basalt 214 \n(DeLong and Chatelain, 1990; Bus\u00e0 et al., 2002). 215 \nWith respect to N-MORB, Semporna Plio-Pleistocene lavas contain high concentrations of 216 \nthe majority of incompatible elements (Fig. 4). As already noted, Tawau samples possess 217 \nhigher concentrations of most trace elements for any particular MgO content. The patterns 218 \nfor the most mafic rock from Tawau (SBK 13) and Mostyn have the smoothest patterns, in 219 \nwhich HFSE display negligible depletion relative to neighbouring elements. This contrasts 220 \nwith typical subduction-related magmas, including Mio-Pliocene lavas from Tawau (Chiang, 221 \n2002). Negative relative Nb anomalies become increasingly apparent in more evolved rocks 222 \n(Fig. 5). Concentrations of all LILE are elevated with respect to MORB. This is most 223 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 8  \napparent for Pb, which displays prominent positive anomalies compared to neighbouring 224 \nelements in the MORB-normalised plot, but Pb is no more enriched than other LILE with 225 \nrespect to MORB (Fig. 4). Overall, the Semporna lavas possess higher concentrations of 226 \nLILE and LREE than MORB and more closely resemble OIB than typical subduction-related 227 \nmagmatism, although LILE\/LREE ratios are lower than in OIB. The most mafic Semporna 228 \nlavas have HFSE\/LILE and HFSE\/LREE ratios comparable to or even higher than OIB. 229 \nSemporna Plio-Pleistocene lavas possess wide ranges in 87Sr\/86Sr (0.704092 to 0.706291), 230 \n143Nd\/144Nd (0.512846 to 0.512491) and Pb isotope ratios (206Pb\/204Pb; 18.528 to 18.871, 231 \n207Pb\/204Pb; 15.566 to 15.667 and 208Pb\/204Pb; 38.598 to 39.116). Taking the Semporna 232 \nlavas as a single suite the more evolved lavas tend to possess higher 87Sr\/86Sr and Pb 233 \nisotopic ratios and lower 143Nd\/144Nd. Despite the limited number of analyses this statement 234 \nis also true for each site, with the Mostyn lavas offset to slightly higher 87Sr\/86Sr and Pb, and 235 \nlower 143Nd\/144Nd at similar MgO (Fig. 6). Despite these offsets, co-variations between 236 \nisotope ratios of different elements are particularly well defined for the suite as a whole. The 237 \nmost mafic lava has isotopic ratios that lie within the field of Indian Ocean MORB and that 238 \nresemble values for several other small-volume volcanic provinces in SE Asia, but the more 239 \nevolved lavas extend well beyond the field of Indian MORB (Fig. 7). 240 \n5. Discussion 241 \nThe most mafic Semporna lava contains 7.66 wt.% MgO, which is close to the upper range 242 \nof MgO contents in high-Nb basalts from other locations (8-9 wt.%), and is likely to provide a 243 \ngood estimate of the composition of parental magma. Although, SBK13 has a smooth trace 244 \nelement pattern (Fig. 4), mild to moderate Nb depletion (Nb\/K)n < 1 is apparent in many 245 \nSemporna rocks, which might indicate a role for subduction-modified mantle. To understand 246 \nthe extent to which the relative Nb depletion of Semporna lavas is inherited from the mantle 247 \nsource it is necessary to determine how differentiation has affected trace elements. 248 \n5.1 Nb depletion of Semporna Plio-Pleistocene magma during differentiation 249 \nIt is unlikely that the geochemical variations within the Semporna Plio-Pleistocene lavas 250 \nresult from fractional crystallisation of a uniform parental magma composition. First, 251 \nconcentrations of several elements that are usually incompatible during crystallisation of 252 \nbasaltic magma decrease with MgO. In all of the sub-groups P2O5, Nb and Sr decrease 253 \nstrongly from basalt to basaltic andesite. In the Mostyn group the other LILE and La also 254 \nshow the same effect (Fig. 3). Second, variations in Nb, K and La suggest unusual 255 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 9  \nbehaviour between HFSE, LILE and LREE. These elements have similar compatibilities in 256 \nbasaltic magma, therefore (Nb\/La)n and (Nb\/K)n should change little as basalt differentiates 257 \nto basaltic andesite in a closed system. However, with the exception of relatively high Nb\/La 258 \nin two PP1 samples, both ratios become lower as MgO decreases (Fig. 5). Third, like Nb\/La 259 \nand Nb\/K, the isotopic ratios of Sr, Nd and Pb should not vary in a suite of lavas produced by 260 \nfractional crystallisation of uniform parental magma. In the Semporna lavas there are large 261 \nranges in each of these ratios, which change from the most to least evolved rocks (Fig. 6 262 \nand 7). 263 \nThe strong inter-isotope correlations suggest that two main components are involved at 264 \nSemporna (Fig. 7). Magma mixing, either between basic and evolved melts, or two mafic 265 \nmelts with different sources, is considered unlikely, since no petrographic evidence was 266 \nfound to indicate such a process. Therefore, we conclude that mafic, mantle-derived magma 267 \nwas contaminated by crust possessing high 87Sr\/86Sr and Pb isotope ratios and low 268 \n143Nd\/144Nd during differentiation from basalt to basaltic andesite. It is difficult to determine 269 \nthe nature of the contaminant because there are very few analyses of the compositions, and 270 \nparticularly isotopic ratios, of basement lithologies in Sabah. However, a number of 271 \nreasonable inferences can be made. Mio-Pliocene arc magmatism from Sabah is 272 \ncharacterised by Sr and Pb isotope ratios that are too low and by Nd isotope ratios that are 273 \ntoo high to be the contaminant (Figs. 6). Similarly, the Mesozoic ophiolitic basement of 274 \nSabah, which is most likely to be comprised of fragments of oceanic crust resembling Indian 275 \nOcean MORB, would possess low 86Sr\/86Sr and high 143Nd\/144Nd (Omang and Barber, 1996; 276 \nWeis and Frey, 1996). 277 \nIn Sabah the only exposures of rocks derived from the lower crust are granite bodies. Mount 278 \nKinabalu, in north Sabah, is a composite granite that was intruded over a short period during 279 \nthe Miocene (Cottam et al., in press). Unfortunately, sufficient isotopic data do not exist to 280 \nconduct detailed modelling of the effects of contamination by this material. However, the 281 \n86Sr\/86Sr range, from 0.706364 to 0.707832 (Chiang, 2002), suggests that material of this 282 \ntype would not be a suitable contaminant. The lower end of the range would require more 283 \nthan 95% contamination of SBK13 to produce the highest 86Sr\/86Sr in the Semporna suite 284 \nwhile the upper end of the range would require 60% contamination. In both cases, such 285 \nlevels of contamination would produce magma that was more silicic than the most evolved 286 \nbasaltic andesite. Assimilation of such material can be examined further by using an 287 \nanalogous granitic body from the island of Palawan (Fig. 1). For reasonable values of r (the 288 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 10  \nratio of mass assimilated to mass crystallised), assimilation of Capoas granite during 289 \nfactional crystallisation of SBK13 fails to produce an array resembling the Semporna dataset 290 \n(model LC 1 in Fig. 8). Bulk mixing of SBK13 with magma resembling the Capoas granite 291 \nmight achieve a closer fit to the isotopic and major element characteristics of the Semporna 292 \nsuite but would still require up to 40% contamination by the granitic component. As 293 \ndiscussed above, there is no evidence of magma mixing in the Semporna rocks, which 294 \nshould be readily observed for such extensive contamination. 295 \nEast Indonesian sediments (Vroon et al., 1995) may contain components that resemble the 296 \ncrustal fragments which were incorporated into SE Asian lithosphere. Therefore, we have 297 \nalso explored assimilation with fractional crystallisation (AFC) models using these sediments 298 \nas crustal contaminants. Despite suitable Sr and Pb characteristics even the most extreme 299 \nEast Indonesia sediment composition does not possess sufficiently low 143Nd\/144Nd to 300 \nprovide an appropriate contaminant (model EIS 1, Fig. 8). Increasing r, even to the relatively 301 \nhigh value of 0.85, does not produce a fit to the data (model EIS 2) and reduces the amount 302 \nof differentiation to the extent that there would virtually no change in major element 303 \nchemistry of the magma. 304 \nDue to the restricted range of MgO contents in the Semporna lavas the contaminant requires 305 \nvery low 143Nd\/144Nd. Good fits to the Semporna dataset can be achieved for AFC models 306 \nusing assimilants with the isotopic characteristics of Archean crustal rocks via the moderate 307 \nextents of crystallisation required to differentiate from basalt to basaltic andesite (models AC 308 \n1 and AC 2, Fig. 8). Although rocks of this age are not exposed in Sabah, Palaeoproterozoic 309 \nages have been determined for detrital zircons from the Crocker Formation in northern 310 \nBorneo, for which van Hattum et al. (2006) postulated a local origin, and for inherited zircon 311 \ncrystals in the Kinabalu granite (Cottam et al., in press). Therefore, we postulate the 312 \nSemporna crust contains Archean domains. Continental fragments may have been 313 \nembedded in the Mesozoic oceanic lithosphere now forming the ophiolitic basement of 314 \nSabah, or may have been incorporated during northward and westward dispersion of 315 \ncontinental material derived from the leading edge of the Australian continent as it interacted 316 \nwith SE Asia during the Cenozoic (Hutchison et al., 2001; Hall, 2002). van Leeuwen et al. 317 \n(2007) recently proposed such an origin for the Malino complex, northwest Sulawesi, where 318 \nArchean inherited zircons have been discovered. 319 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 11  \n5.2 Semporna parental magma without Nb depletion 320 \nDifferentiation is the primary control on the extent of Nb depletion in Semporna lavas 321 \n(Section 5.1). More specifically, Nb concentrations are lower and Nb-depletion, relative to 322 \nother elements, is more marked in rocks that have experienced greater amounts of crustal 323 \ncontamination. The Nb contents of the most mafic basalts suggest that all magma left the 324 \nmantle containing sufficient Nb to be classed as high Nb-basalt but during subsequent 325 \ndifferentiation Nb, and several other elements, were diluted as many melt batches effectively 326 \nevolved into Nb-enriched basalt (Fig. 3g). Therefore, classifying these rocks as high-Nb 327 \nbasalt or Nb-enriched basalt has no significance for source characteristics or processes; it is 328 \nsimply a function of the extent to which the melts differentiated. 329 \nSemporna lavas define single, coherent arrays when different isotopic ratios are compared 330 \nwith one another (Fig. 7) suggesting that there is only minor variation in the isotopic 331 \ncompositions of the mantle source and of the contaminant. These arrays are also consistent 332 \nwith a restricted range in Sr\/Nd ratios in the parental magma. Like Nb\/K and Nb\/La (Fig. 5), 333 \nmany trace element ratios show less variation towards the more mafic end of the 334 \ncompositional range and converge on the values in SBK13. This suggests that differentiation 335 \nwas responsible for generating much of the heterogeneity in both isotopic ratios and 336 \nincompatible element ratios between different members of the suite. 337 \nThe most mafic lavas from Tawau and Mostyn display sub-parallel incompatible trace 338 \nelement patterns suggesting that their mantle sources did not possess relative depletion of 339 \nNb (Fig. 4). These patterns are very similar to those of parental magma in the rest of the 340 \nSulu Arc (Fig. 9a). The Sr, Nd and Pb isotope ratios of the least evolved northern, central 341 \nand southern Sulu suites also converge on similar values suggesting shared sources. 342 \nCastillo et al. (2007) demonstrated that northern and central Sulu Arc lavas possess isotopic 343 \nratios similar to those of basalts from the Scarborough Seamounts and Reed Bank in the 344 \nSouth China Sea (Fig. 1a). This similarity extends to Quaternary magmatism from Hainan 345 \nIsland on the northern margin of the South China Sea (Figs. 7 and 9b). The three South 346 \nChina Sea suites possess inter-element ratios very similar to OIB. The Sulu Arc suites also 347 \nshow OIB-like patterns, with the exception of relative depletions in LREE, Sr and P (Fig. 9a). 348 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 12  \n5.3 Source of Semporna Plio-Pleistocene magmatism 349 \nTwo main mechanisms have been proposed to explain how the mantle sources of high-Nb 350 \nmagmatism might develop. One involves metasomatism of mantle by partial melts from 351 \nsubducted crust (Defant et al., 1992) and, as such, implies an intrinsic role for subduction in 352 \nproducing such sources. The other advocates an enriched mantle resembling the source of 353 \nOIB (Reagan and Gill, 1989), so is independent of subduction. Resolving which mechanism 354 \nis responsible for producing high-Nb sources has important implications for understanding 355 \nthe dynamics of the subduction zones in which they occur. 356 \n5.3.1 Mantle metasomatism by partial melt from subducted basalt 357 \nIsotope ratios can be used to test whether partial melts derived from subducted lithosphere 358 \nhave metasomatised the Semporna mantle. Chiang (2002) examined variations in 359 \nincompatible trace element ratios of Neogene magmatism across the Semporna and Dent 360 \npeninsulas and concluded that the subducted slab was Celebes Sea oceanic lithosphere. 361 \nOther studies have favoured the Sulu Sea as the source of the slab (e.g. Castillo et al., 362 \n2007) but the two basins are floored by basalt with similar isotopic compositions (Fig. 7) and 363 \nso the distinction is irrelevant for the purpose of conducting this test. Isotopically distinctive 364 \nbasalt has been recovered from the Cagayan Ridge in the Sulu Sea, but the petrology and 365 \ngeochemistry of these rocks indicate that this bathymetric high originated as a volcanic arc 366 \n(Bellon and Rangin, 1991; Spadea et al., 1991 and 1996). Features of this type have a lower 367 \nprobability of being subducted than the oceanic lithosphere of the adjacent basins. 368 \nTherefore, the Cagayan Ridge samples are unlikely to represent a feasible slab melt 369 \ncomposition. 370 \nIf Semporna Plio-Pleistocene basalt originated in mantle that was metasomatised by partial 371 \nmelts from subducted lithosphere then (i) the most mafic Semporna lavas should possess 372 \nisotope ratios closest to the compositions of Sulu or Celebes ocean floor basalt, and (ii) the 373 \nSemporna isotopic arrays should trend towards that field. Some of the Semporna isotopic 374 \narrays do project back towards Sulu-Celebes compositions (e.g. 143Nd\/144Nd versus 87Sr\/86Sr 375 \nand 208Pb\/204Pb versus 206Pb\/204Pb). However, the 207Pb\/204Pb versus 206Pb\/204Pb and 376 \n143Nd\/144Nd versus 207Pb\/204Pb arrays clearly trend outside the range of Celebes and Sulu 377 \noceanic basalts and would infer a mantle with considerably higher 206Pb\/204Pb at the 378 \nmeasured 207Pb\/204Pb or 143Nd\/144Nd than the putative slab compositions (Fig. 7). 379 \nFurthermore, the most mafic Semporna lava, which has experienced negligible 380 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 13  \ncontamination by crust (Section 5.1), lies significantly outside the Sulu-Celebes range for 381 \n87Sr\/86Sr, 206Pb\/204Pb and 208Pb\/204Pb. 382 \nThere is good evidence that subduction occurred beneath the Sulu Arc during the Miocene 383 \nbut the South China Sea sites lie as much as 1500km from Sulu and have not experienced 384 \nrecent subduction (Fig. 1a). It is extremely unlikely that metasomatism by partial melts of 385 \ndifferent subducted slabs at different times could yield sources with similar trace element 386 \nand isotopic ratios beneath the Sulu Arc, Hainan Island, Scarborough Seamounts and Reed 387 \nBank (Figs. 7 and 9b). Therefore, we conclude that the source of Semporna Plio-Pleistocene 388 \nlavas did not contain a significant contribution from partially-melted subducted lithosphere. 389 \nCastillo et al. (2007) reached a similar conclusion for the central and northern Sulu Arc. 390 \n5.3.2 Intra-plate (OIB) mantle source 391 \nThe least contaminated Semporna lava resembles many OIB in possessing high 87Sr\/86Sr 392 \nand Pb isotope ratios and low 143Nd\/144Nd relative to the source of MORB (Fig. 7). Like 393 \nmagmatism in the South China Sea (Tu et al., 1991 and 1992; Flower et al., 1992), many 394 \nincompatible trace element ratios of Semporna lavas also resemble OIB. Mafic Semporna 395 \nlavas possess LILE\/LILE, HSFE\/HFSE and LILE\/HFSE ratios similar to OIB, although 396 \nconcentrations of Sr are less enriched than other LILE. These traits are also shared by 397 \ncentral and northern Sulu Arc lavas (Fig. 9a). The marked decrease of Sr with decreasing 398 \nMgO in the Semporna suite suggests that this may be a product of crustal contamination 399 \nsuch that SBK13 underestimates the true Sr content of the Semporna source, relative to 400 \nother elements (Fig. 3c). Similarly, the decrease of P2O5 with MgO in most of the sub-groups 401 \n(Fig. 2) means that the P content of the source may also be underestimated (Fig. 9a). All 402 \nSulu Arc lavas, however, have low LREE\/HFSE and LREE\/LILE, with respect to OIB. This is 403 \nnot a product of crustal contamination since the depletion of LREE relative to HFSE 404 \nbecomes less, not more, pronounced as MgO decreases (Fig. 5b). Indeed, (Nb\/La)n is 405 \ngreater than 2 in the most mafic samples, suggesting a significant depletion of LREE with 406 \nrespect to the OIB source and to depleted mantle. Identifying a mechanism for producing 407 \nLREE depletion of parental magma in the Sulu Arc would reconcile the differences between 408 \nthis and the South China Sea intra-plate magmatism (Fig. 9a) to a common OIB-like source. 409 \nThe low LREE\/HFSE and LREE\/LILE ratios of mafic Sulu Arc magmatism might be 410 \nproduced in three ways: (1) through selective enrichment of LILE and HFSE in a source that 411 \nwas originally depleted in all incompatible elements, (2) during partial melting of an OIB 412 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 14  \nsource in the presence of a phase that retains LREE, or (3) through element fractionation as 413 \nmelt migrates through the mantle. 414 \nThe source of Plio-Pleistocene Sulu Arc magmatism cannot be produced through 415 \nenrichment of depleted mantle by a slab-derived fluid. This process would generate the 416 \nmarked HFSE depletions typical of subduction-related magmatism. Partial melts of 417 \nsubducted slabs are also precluded as an enriching agent on the basis of isotopic ratios 418 \n(Section 5.3.1). Metasomatism of depleted mantle by small degree partial melts of the upper 419 \nmantle can fractionate LILE, HFSE and REE relative to one another, with or without 420 \nproducing modal metasomatic phases (Bodinier et al., 1996; Pilet et al., 2004). This 421 \nexplanation might be feasible for the Sulu Arc alone but is more difficult to sustain in view of 422 \nthe many other similarities between Sulu Arc and South China Sea lavas (Fig. 7 and 9b). A 423 \ndistinct LREE-enrichment event might have affected the South China Sea mantle, 424 \nindependent of an LILE- and HFSE-enrichment affecting the Sulu Arc and South China Sea. 425 \nThis, however, would require an entirely complementary relationship in the chemical budgets 426 \nof the two metasomatic agents such that their summed effect produced a South China Sea 427 \nmantle source with OIB-like chemistry. We consider this highly unlikely. Therefore, we 428 \nconclude that enrichment of depleted mantle, alone, cannot have produced the similar 429 \nsources of the Sulu Arc and South China Sea magmatic suites. 430 \nA wide range of minor, metasomatic phases might be present in the source of OIB-like 431 \nmagmas that could fractionate trace elements, particularly at low degree of partial melting. It 432 \nis not possible to constrain possible roles for all of these but several obvious possibilities can 433 \nbe eliminated. Phlogopite and kaersutite can produce significant fractionation of HFSE from 434 \nLREE but this should be in the opposite sense to that required to generate high Nb\/La in 435 \nSulu i.e. Nb would be retained in the source relative to LREE yielding low-Nb\/La melt 436 \n(Schmidt et al., 1999; Tiepolo et al., 2000). This partitioning has strong compositional-437 \ndependence in amphibole but the ratio of partition coefficients approaches unity as the host 438 \nrock Mg# approaches mantle values and does not reverse (Tiepolo et al., 2000). Apatite 439 \nwould preferentially retain LREE as well as P, which is mildly depleted in the Semporna 440 \nrocks, but would also be expected to generate a significant negative Th anomaly (Chazot et 441 \nal., 1996), which is not observed (Fig. 9a). Although other minor phases may be able to 442 \npartition elements in a suitable way, the absolute concentration of incompatible elements in 443 \nthe different magmatic suites is inconsistent with derivation by variable degrees of partial 444 \nmelting of similar sources. The imprint of distinctive minor phases should be more apparent 445 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 15  \nin low degree partial melts. With increasing degrees of partial melting the residue would 446 \nevolve towards a simpler assemblage with partition coefficients resembling those typical of 447 \nthe upper mantle and yield magma with lower concentrations of all incompatible elements. 448 \nHowever, HFSE\/LREE fractionation, with respect to OIB, is absent in South China Sea 449 \nlavas, which possess the high incompatible element concentrations expected of lower 450 \ndegrees of partial melting (Fig. 9a). High Nb\/La is found in the Sulu Arc lavas that have lower 451 \nconcentrations of incompatible elements. Therefore, we consider it unlikely that the LREE 452 \ndepletion of Sulu Arc magmatism results from low-degree partial melting of OIB source 453 \nmantle in the presence of a residual phase with high DLREE. 454 \nInteraction between melt and mantle peridotite may seem an unlikely process to produce the 455 \nobserved fractionation of LREE from LILE and HFSE, given that element partitioning should 456 \nbe governed by similar distribution coefficients to those operating during partial melting 457 \n(Navon and Stolper, 1987). Indeed, experimental studies have concluded that reaction with 458 \nperidotite will decrease the concentrations of HFSE in melt, relative to other incompatible 459 \nelements (Kelemen et al., 1990 and 1993). Despite this, empirical evidence suggests that 460 \nREE can be fractionated from other incompatible elements as basaltic melt interacts with 461 \nupper mantle. Refertilization of depleted mantle by basaltic magma has been proposed as 462 \nthe origin of layered websterites (\u2018group C\u2019 pyroxenites) from the \u201casthenospherised\u201d part of 463 \nthe Ronda massif in Spain (Lenoir et al., 2001; Bodinier et al., 2008). Both the websterite 464 \nlayers and their host peridotites in the sub-lithospheric domain show strong enrichment of 465 \nLREE relative to HSFE and LILE, while LILE\/HFSE ratios display much less fractionation 466 \n(Bodinier et al., 2008). A complementary (melt) product, with high HFSE\/LREE and 467 \nLILE\/LREE ratios, is not observed at Ronda but the massif provides evidence that melt-468 \nmantle interaction can modify LREE concentrations of magma relative to elements with 469 \nsimilar distribution coefficients. 470 \n5.3.3 A model for intra-plate magmatism in the Sulu Arc and South China Sea 471 \nIntra-plate magmatism in the Sulu Arc and South China Sea was derived from an OIB-like 472 \nsource. South China Sea magmatism occurred where the lithosphere was experiencing, or 473 \nhad recently experienced, mechanical thinning. Hainan, where most lava was erupted into 474 \nthe Lei-Qiong graben, was extended by pull-apart tectonics on the northern margin of the 475 \nSouth China Sea (Tu et al., 1991; Flower et al., 1992). Reed Bank lies on edge of a 476 \npresumed continental fragment on the conjugate, southern, extended margin of the inactive 477 \nSouth China Sea. The mid- to late-Neogene Scarborough Seamounts were generated close 478 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 16  \nto the South China Sea spreading axis, which had become extinct 5-10 million years 479 \npreviously (Fig. 1a; Tu et al., 1992). The continental margin settings of Hainan and Reed 480 \nBank could be consistent with sources in the mantle lithosphere. However, the South China 481 \nSea lithosphere was very young when intra-plate magmatism occurred. Therefore, even if 482 \nthe source of this suite was hosted in the lithosphere it can have resided there for only a 483 \nvery short period since accretion\/addition from the convecting mantle. In view of the 484 \nwidespread distribution of magmatic suites with similar trace element and isotopic chemistry 485 \n(Fig. 9), we conclude that the source of intra-plate magmatism in the South China Sea and 486 \nits extended margins was an OIB-like component in the upper mantle that melted as it 487 \nupwelled beneath recently thinned lithosphere. As well as reducing the thickness of 488 \nlithospheric mantle, preceding extension could provide large, lithosphere-penetrating 489 \nstructures that would facilitate transport of melt towards the surface and, thus, reduce the 490 \nopportunity for interaction with the lithospheric mantle or crust. 491 \nPlio-Pleistocene magmatism in the Sulu Arc was extracted from similar enriched mantle, 492 \nalso during upwelling beneath thinned lithosphere. Upwelling might have occurred beneath 493 \nlocalised sites of extension, but the Sulu Arc lithosphere would have experienced substantial 494 \nthinning during Miocene subduction in the Sulu Arc (Andrews and Sleep, 1974; Hamilton, 495 \n1995; Macpherson and Hall, 2002; Arcay et al., 2006). Such thinning is probably less reliant 496 \non mechanical deformation than is the case for extended margins. Instead, rheological 497 \nchanges result in (i) convective erosion, or corner flow, removing mass from the base of arc 498 \nlithosphere (Hamilton, 1995; Billen and Gurnis, 2001; Arcay et al., 2006; Macpherson, 2008) 499 \nand\/or (ii) gravitational instabilities removing dense material from throughout the thickness of 500 \narc lithosphere (Rudnick, 1995). Lithospheric thin-spots produced by Miocene subduction 501 \nwould provide sites where enriched mantle could upwell and produce small volumes of intra-502 \nplate magmatism along the axis of the former arc front. In contrast to locations in and around 503 \nthe South China Sea, large, lithosphere-penetrating, extensional structures would be rare in 504 \nthe Sulu environment, increasing the probability that melt would interact with lithospheric 505 \nmantle during transport from the subjacent asthenosphere. 506 \nSemporna lies at the end of the northeast-southwest trending Sulu Arc (Fig. 1a). Further 507 \nsouthwest are several other Plio-Pleistocene to Recent low-volume volcanic fields that cap 508 \nthe topography of central Borneo at Hose Mountains, Kelian, Metalung, Nuit and Usun Apau 509 \n(Fig. 1a). There are very few studies of these occurrences but data from Chiang (2002) show 510 \nthat basalt from Kelian possesses c. 20ppm Nb and there is a distinct decrease in Nb\/K with 511 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 17  \nMgO, similar to that seen in the Sulu Arc (Fig. 5a). Therefore, the same enrichment 512 \nresponsible for Sulu Arc and South China Sea magmatism may be present in upper mantle 513 \nbeneath Borneo and has encountered thin spots in the lithosphere that have allowed it to 514 \nupwell and melt. To the north of Borneo young, high-Nb magmatism from northern Palawan 515 \n(Fig. 1a) may also share the same source (Arcilla et al., 2003). 516 \n5.4 Implications for high-Nb magmatism in active arcs 517 \nOur findings indicate that high-Nb basaltic magmatism in the Semporna peninsula, and 518 \nelsewhere in the Sulu Arc, does not require a contribution from subducted crust. If this 519 \nconclusion is also valid in arcs where high-Nb magmatism is contemporaneous with typical 520 \narc magmatism then parts of the mantle wedge must escape significant metasomatism by 521 \nmaterial derived from the subducted slab. In particular, the original finding of Reagan and 522 \nGill (1989); that high-Nb basalts and calc-alkaline magma were erupted from the same 523 \ncentre, implies that slab-fluxed and un-fluxed mantle may be present within the source 524 \nvolume of a single volcano. 525 \nIntra-plate or OIB-type mantle has been advocated as the prevalent mantle wedge 526 \ncomponent in some volcanic arcs (e.g. Mexico, G\u00f3mez-Tuena et al., 2007). In view of the 527 \nlow recycled flux inferred for Semporna mantle it is tempting to regard the source of Plio-528 \nPleistocene magmatism as representative of the bulk mantle beneath the Sulu Arc. 529 \nHowever, the relatively low volumes of Semporna Plio-Pleistocene magmatism indicate a 530 \nfinite source that was rapidly exhausted after melting commenced. This conclusion is 531 \nreinforced by the other sites in Borneo and the South China Sea, where OIB-like magma 532 \nalso occurs in low volumes. Such enriched domains may be relatively common in the upper 533 \nmantle beneath much of SE Asia, but their signature would be swamped when conditions 534 \nallow partial melting of the more refractory mantle in which the enrichments are hosted. This 535 \nis analogous to the recognition of melt derived from enriched mantle on the margins of active 536 \nrift systems. Such domains may also be present beneath the rift but their signature is 537 \noverwhelmed where partial melting becomes more extensive close to rift axes (e.g. Iceland, 538 \nFitton et al., 2003). 539 \n5.5 The high-Nb basalt \u2013 adakite association 540 \nThe frequent association of high-Nb basalt with adakitic magmatism led Defant et al. (1992) 541 \nto postulate a genetic link, in which adakitic magma metasomatised the mantle to produce 542 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 18  \nthe high-Nb source. Defant and Drummond (1990) regarded adakites as direct samples of 543 \nmagma generated by partial melting of subducted basaltic crust but an increasing number of 544 \nstudies have questioned this model (Garrison and Davidson, 2003; Prouteau and Scaillet, 545 \n2003; Chiaradia et al., 2004; Macpherson et al., 2006; Eiler et al., 2007; Rodriguez et al., 546 \n2007). The sources of high-Nb basalt in Semporna, and related SE Asian sites, cannot have 547 \nbeen produced by metasomatism of depleted mantle by slab melt (Section 5.3.1). 548 \nFurthermore, although adakitic rocks have been found in the northern Sulu Arc (Sajona et al. 549 \n1996; Castillo et al., 2007) there is no evidence for adakitic magmatism in the Semporna 550 \npeninsula. Similarly, adakitic magmatism has not been documented in association with the 551 \nhigh-Nb basalt suites of the South China Sea and its margins. Therefore, Semporna and the 552 \nSouth China Sea weaken the case for a petrogenetic link where these two distinctive 553 \n\u201cflavours\u201d of magmatism occur in a single subduction zone. 554 \nDespite this assertion, the fact remains that several margins have produced both adakitic 555 \nand high-Nb magmatism (Defant et al., 1992). Macpherson et al. (2006) used an example 556 \nfrom the East Philippine Arc to show that adakitic magmatism can occur where hydrous arc 557 \nbasalt, produced by fluid-fluxed melting of the mantle wedge, ponds at relatively deep levels 558 \nand crystallises garnet (\u00b1 amphibole). Adakitic magma was produced when this crystal 559 \nassemblage was removed from hydrous basaltic magma or when the resulting cumulate 560 \nrocks experienced partial melting. The East Philippine setting was conducive to these 561 \nprocesses because the plate margin was young and so the arc lithosphere had experienced 562 \nlimited thinning. The deeper parts of this thick arc lithosphere acted as a barrier to melt 563 \ntransport promoting crystallisation of basalt at depth. Meanwhile, the shallow portions had 564 \nyet to develop substantial magma plumbing systems, therefore, geochemical evidence of 565 \ndeep differentiation was not overprinted by subsequent differentiation when the adakitic melt 566 \nwas emplaced (Macpherson, 2008). 567 \nThe potential for an active arc to generate high-Nb magmatism depends on the presence of 568 \na suitably enriched source in the mantle wedge. But, like adakitic magma, the distinctive 569 \ngeochemistry of high-Nb basalt is most likely to be preserved where it is not overprinted by 570 \ninteraction with large volumes of melt derived from slab-modified mantle wedge and\/or by 571 \ndifferentiation in the shallow crust. We propose that the occurrence of adakitic and high-Nb 572 \nmagmatism together in an arc does not reflect a genetic link between their sources. Instead, 573 \nwe postulate that there is a significant increase in the probability that magmatism will retain 574 \ndistinctive geochemical signatures derived at depth e.g. either by deep differentiation 575 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 19  \n(adakitic magmatism) or inherited from a distinctive mantle source (high-Nb magmatism), 576 \nduring transport through arc lithosphere that receives a low flux of melt from slab-modified 577 \nmantle and\/or hosts poorly developed magma plumbing in the shallow crust. 578 \n6. Conclusions 579 \n1. Plio-Pleistocene basalts and basaltic andesites from the Semporna peninsula of the 580 \nsouthern Sulu Arc contain higher concentrations of Nb than typical arc magmatism. The 581 \nmost mafic lavas have negligible Nb depletions relative to elements with similar compatibility. 582 \nDepletion of Nb, and several other incompatible elements, occurred during differentiation 583 \nfrom basalt to basaltic andesite. This was accompanied by striking changes in isotopic ratios 584 \nthat indicate interaction with the crust. The isotopic characteristics of the contaminant 585 \nindicate an ancient, possibly Archean, component is present in the Sabah crust. 586 \n2. The primitive Semporna lavas closely resemble high-Nb and Nb-enriched basalts from the 587 \ncentral (Sulu Islands) and northern (Zamboanga) segments of the Sulu Arc. Isotopic ratios 588 \npreclude a role for metasomatism of Sulu Arc mantle by melt derived from subducted Sulu 589 \nSea or Celebes Sea oceanic crust. Mafic Sulu Arc lavas possess incompatible trace element 590 \nratios that resemble ocean island basalt but are depleted in light rare earth elements. Sulu 591 \nArc basalts also resemble mafic magmatism at several sites in and around the South China 592 \nSea, which differ only in lacking light rare earth element depletion. This similarity and the 593 \nrange of localities indicates a common source present in the convecting upper mantle. This 594 \nmagmatic province may also extend southwest into central Borneo. 595 \n3. The Sulu Arc runs from the Zamboanga peninsula through the Sulu Islands to the 596 \nSemporna peninsula, yet there is little other geological or geophysical evidence to support 597 \nactive subduction beneath this structure. Plio-Pleistocene magmatism resulted from 598 \nupwelling of OIB-like domains in the upper mantle into lithospheric thin spots that were 599 \nproduced during Miocene subduction. 600 \n4. Light rare earth element depletion of Sulu magmatism cannot be attributed to crustal 601 \ncontamination and probably occurred when basaltic melt interacted with mantle peridotite 602 \nduring transport through the Sulu Arc lithosphere. South China Sea magmatism may have 603 \nescaped this process due to transport along extensional structures in oceanic lithosphere 604 \nand stretched continental margins. 605 \nMacpherson et al.: Semporna Plio-Pleistocene Magmatism 20  \nAcknowledgements 606 \nThe SE Asia Research Group, Royal Holloway University of London, funded much of this 607 \nwork.
