The overall aim of this paper is to present an example of the\nkind of detailed research necessary to identify factors associated with low rates of\nparticipation in higher education by some groups of young people. A number of studies\nhave suggested that in addition to educational attainment, issues such as social class,\ngender and parental education also in\u008f uence a young person\u2019s likelihood of entering\nhigher education. In this paper we undertake exploratory analysis of a series of nationally\nrepresentative data and through statistical modelling we then identify the factors that\nin\u008f uence a young person\u2019s chances of entry into higher education and participating on a\ndegree level course. Through sample enumeration, an innovative statistical methodology,\nwe were then able to quantify the substantive effects of these factors. We found that net\nof educational attainment a number of factors (e.g. gender and social background\nvariables) in\u008f uence the likelihood of a young person entering higher education and\nparticipating on a degree level course. In addition our analysis highlights the interwoven\neffects of parental education and schooling and we discuss the complex nature of the effects\nof ethnicity.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe National Committee of Enquiry into Higher Education (Dearing, 1997) highlighted\nthe existence of unequal rates of participation in higher education by some groups\nwithin society. The recent Green Paper The Learning Age\u2014A Renaissance for a New\nBritain, directly addresses the issue of opening up access to higher education. The\ngovernment states that their priority is to reach out and include those from groups that\nhave been under-represented in higher education. These include young people from\nsemi-skilled or unskilled family backgrounds and certain ethnic minorities.\nThe analysis of differential rates of access to higher education has a long history (see\nfor example Rudd, 1976, 1987a & 1987b; Halsey et al., 1980; Moore, 1983; Royal\nStatistical Society, 1985; Redpath & Harvey, 1987; Burnhill et al., 1988 & 1990;\nBlackburn & Jarman, 1993; Cheng & Heath, 1993; Eggerton & Halsey, 1993; Halsey,\n1993; Modood, 1993; Paterson, 1993 & 1997; Batey & Brown, 1997; Metcalf, 1997;\nParry, 1997; Savage & Egerton, 1997; Raab, 1998). Anyone surveying the literature in\nthis area will become aware of its confused nature. This is partly due to the different\nfocus of these research projects. Some studies are primarily concerned with the analysis\nof the education system, whereas others focus on young people and higher education,\nISSN 0305-4985 print; ISSN 1465-3915 online\/02\/010005-16 \u00d3 2002 Taylor & Francis Ltd\nDOI: 10.1080\/03054980120113607\n6 Oxford Review of Education\nupon class analysis and social mobility, or address issues of planning and social policy.\nWhilst the existing studies document useful results, the disparate nature of the sources\nof data which are analysed and the methodologies that are employed mean that\ncomparisons are problematic.\nOverall, the literature on access to higher education sends the message that there is\nsocial inequality. Breen and Goldthorpe (1997) argue that the wealth of sociological\nevidence seems to suggest that a series of empirical generalisations can readily be made\nand constitute explananda. Young people of less advantaged social backgrounds have\nnot increased their levels of participation in more ambitious educational options, thus\nclosing the gap with their more advantaged counterparts.\nThis paper is timely because the Government has put the subject of inequality of\naccess back on the agenda and have suggested that there is a need to identify the factors\nthat lead some young people not to enter higher education (see especially Section 4.31\nof the Green Paper). In this paper we report the initial \u008e ndings of a research project on\nyoung people\u2019s routes to higher education. The primary aim of this paper is to present\nan example of the kind of detailed research which we believe is required to identify the\nfactors which in\u008f uence young people\u2019s entry into higher education and are associated\nwith low rates of participation by various social groups.\nIn this paper we undertake analysis of a set of nationally representative data (The\nYouth Cohort Study of England and Wales). Our approach has been to undertake an\nexploratory statistical analysis in order to identify a range of factors that in\u008f uence young\npeople\u2019s entry into higher education and participation on degree level programmes of\nstudy. Our primary research question is, \u2018net of attainment, do external in\u008f uences such\nas family\u2019s social class, parental education, gender and ethnicity in\u008f uence a young\nperson\u2019s chance of studying for a degree?\u2019\nAn integral aspect of the paper is that we bring to bear a distinct statistical\nmethodology, namely sample enumeration. As well as identifying the \u2018statistically\u2019\nsigni\u008e cant factors that in\u008f uence entry to higher education it will be possible to quantify\ntheir \u2018substantive\u2019 signi\u008e cance. Methodologically, this represents a substantial depar-\nture from the limits of the conventional interpretation of statistical models within\nsociology. Following from this, adopting a sample enumeration methodology allows us\nto extend the substantive sociological analysis of this issue.\nDATA\nThe Youth Cohort Study of England and Wales (YCS) is a major programme of\nlongitudinal research designed to monitor the behaviour and decisions of representative\nsamples of young people aged 16 to 19 as they reach minimum school leaving age and\neither stay on in education or enter the labour market. The survey collects information\non the young people\u2019s experiences of education, training and work as well as infor-\nmation on their aspirations, their family and their personal circumstances. Therefore\nthe YCS contains relevant variables for the analysis here. Cohort members are con-\ntacted by post three times, at yearly intervals, when they are 16\u201317, 17\u201318 and 18\u201319,\nand in the case of Cohort III again at age 23. In this paper we undertake analysis of\nCohort III data. The young people in this cohort were born in 1969 and 1970. This\ncohort is of particular interest as it coincides with the expansion in British higher\neducation in the later 1980s. In this analysis our outcome variable is whether or not the\nyoung person was studying for a degree (in sweep 3).\nYoung People\u2019s Entry into Higher Education 7\nRESULTS\nWe tested for a wide range of effects including individual, family background and\nschool factors (see Table I). Academic attainment is central to young people\u2019s entry to\ndegree level higher education. The analysis indicates that, after controlling for individ-\nual attainment, family\u2019s occupational social class, gender, parental education, ethnicity,\nhome ownership, schooling, family size and marital status are signi\u008e cant main effects.\nIn the next stage of the analysis we tested for two-way (see Table II) and three-way\ninteraction effects (see Table III). In addition to the main effects there was a signi\u008e cant\ninteraction between parental education and schooling. The model of best \u008e t is reported\nin Table IV.\nTABLE I.

Bothmother\u2019s and father\u2019s occupational social class\n(Registrar General\u2019s Classi\u008e cation) were \u008e tted to the model. The results of these two measures\nwere roughly equivalent, although many young people had mothers who were not in paid\nemployment. We examined both parents\u2019 occupational social class position and taking the higher\nRegistrar General\u2019s social class as the measure of family\u2019s occupational social class constructed\na combined measure of family\u2019s social class.

In the next section we will employ\nsample enumeration to interpret the results of the logistic regression model presented\n10 Oxford Review of Education\nTABLE V. Studying for a degree by social class (two highest\noccupational social classes)\nProfessional Intermediate\nStudying for a degree 240 577\nNot studying for a degree 484 2170\nabove (Table IV). We will illustrate that this procedure allows us to quantify the\n\u2018substantive\u2019 signi\u008e cance of the \u2018statistically\u2019 signi\u008e cant factors in the model.\nOur principal research question is \u2018net of attainment, do external in\u008f uences such as\nfamily\u2019s social class, parental education, gender and ethnicity in\u008f uence a young per-\nson\u2019s chance of studying for a degree?\u2019 For the moment we will concentrate on family\u2019s\noccupational social class. Put simply, we are interested in the direct effects of this\nvariable.\nA standard approach would be to use odds ratios. Table V reports the numbers of\nyoung people who were studying for a degree in the highest two occupational social\nclasses. The odds of studying for a degree, as opposed to not studying for a degree, for\na young person in the professional social class are 0.49 ( 5 240\/484). The odds of\nstudying for a degree, as opposed to not studying for a degree, for a young person in\nthe intermediate social class are 0.26 ( 5 577\/2170). Therefore the odds ratio of\nstudying for a degree for young people from the intermediate social class compared\nwith young people from the professional social class is given by 0.53 ( 5 0.26\/0.49).\nConventionally, this may be interpreted as a measure of association between the two\nvariables in a cross-tabulation analysis.\nThis cross-tabulation is based upon observational data. Therefore the question arises\nas to the extent that the observed association is due to a direct, \u2018causal\u2019 relationship and\nthe extent to which it is a spurious relationship attributable to failure to control for\nother variables. The next logical step in the analysis process would be to \u008e t a statistical\nmodel including appropriate control variables as we have done above.\nThe logistic regression model (see Table IV) includes a range of explanatory variables\nthat from a substantive point of view might be important. The family\u2019s occupational\nsocial class effect is still signi\u008e cant (p , 0.01) and is not eliminated by the inclusion of\nthe other variables. A synoptic examination of the parameter estimates indicates an\nordinal structure to the occupational social class effect. This is consistent with substan-\ntive sociological theories on the effects of family\u2019s occupational social class on educa-\ntional participation. These results do not, however, immediately address the issue of\nhow much of the observed relationship is explained by the other variables and how\nmuch is explained by the family\u2019s occupational social class.\nThe corresponding odds ratio for an explanatory variable are given by l\u02c6 5 exp (b\u02c6),\nwhere b\u02c6 is the estimated parameter value included in Table IV. The estimated odds\nratio for those from the intermediate occupational class compared to the professional\noccupational social class (the reference group) is given by l\u02c6 5 exp ( 2 0.2339) 5 0.79.\nThe association between the two highest occupational social classes and studying for a\ndegree has been reduced (by which we mean that the odds are closer to 1, which\nrepresents no association) by the inclusion of the other variables; the odds ratio has\nincreased from 0.53 to 0.79. This is consistent with what we might expect, having\nextended the analysis to include additional explanatory variables. Unfortunately, the\ncomparison of the two odds ratios does not give us any meaningful measure of how\nYoung People\u2019s Entry into Higher Education 11\nFIG. 1.\nmuch the association has been reduced. As explained above, we would expect the\nodds ratio to change with the inclusion of explanatory variables even if they were\nuncorrelated with occupational social class. Sample enumeration provides a method of\nestimating the contribution of control variables towards \u2018explaining\u2019 the observed\nresponses using a readily understood metric. The method of sample enumeration\nproceeds from \u008e tting a logistic regression model and has the unique advantage of\nallowing us to quantify the individual \u2018substantive\u2019 signi\u008e cance of explanatory variables.\nIn essence, sample enumeration is a model interpretation procedure. The \u008e tted\n(estimated) model is applied to the sample in order to estimate the relationship between\nexplanatory variables and the response variable over the population under study. The\npractical process is depicted in Fig. 1. We have a set of data that provides us with the\nobserved proportions of young people studying for a degree from different occupational\nsocial class backgrounds. To provide increased statistical control we have \u008e tted a\nlogistic regression model to our data that includes a series of other signi\u008e cant explana-\ntory variables. Our interest is in the effects of occupational social class on participation\nin degree level higher education. And, speci\u008e cally, we would like to quantify the effects\nof occupational social class. Using sample enumeration, we address this challenge by\nasking the question \u2018what proportion of young people in the intermediate occupational\nsocial class would have been studying for a degree if they had been in the professional\noccupational social class, all other things being equal?\u2019\nThe process of sample enumeration is best understood by the following analogy.\nSample enumeration is simply a technical process by which we can, hypothetically,\npromote all of the young people in the intermediate occupational social class to the\nprofessional occupational social class. Using our logistic regression model we can then\nestimate the proportion of these young people who would have been studying for a\ndegree given their other characteristics (measured by the other explanatory variables).\nOur observed percentages of young people from the professional occupational social\nclass and from the intermediate occupational social class studying for a degree are 33%\n(240\/720) and 21% (577\/2747) respectively (see Table V). The practical process of\nemploying sample enumeration methods is relatively straightforward. The young peo-\nple from the intermediate occupational social class were extracted from the sample. The\n\u008e tted logistic regression model was then applied to each young person from the\nintermediate occupational social class, but the class effect was set to zero. This is\n12 Oxford Review of Education\nTABLE VI.

This allows us to estimate the probability of each\nof these young people studying for a degree if they behaved like their counterparts in\nthe professional occupational social class whilst controlling for other variables in the\nmodel. Summing these probabilities allows us to construct expected frequencies having\neliminated the direct consequences of occupational social class.\nThe results are reported in Table VI. They show that, whereas only 21% of those in\nthe intermediate social class were studying for a degree, the sample enumeration\nproportion increases to 24%. This directly answers the question, \u2018what proportion of\nyoung people in the intermediate occupational social class would have been studying\nfor a degree if they had been in the professional occupational social class, all other\nthings being equal?\u2019 The sample enumeration method has isolated the direct effect of\noccupational social class as 3% in this case.\nThe observed or \u2018original\u2019 difference between the rates of young people studying for\na degree in the professional occupational social class and in the intermediate social class\nwas 12% (33% 2 21%). This \u008e gure is the observed difference or \u2018shortfall\u2019 between the\nrates of young people studying for a degree in these two occupational social classes.\nThrough sample enumeration we are able to report that 3% of the original 12%\nshortfall is due to the effect of occupational social class. And we can therefore conclude\nthat 9% of the original shortfall is due to the combined effects of the other explanatory\nvariables. These \u008e gures provide a means of quantifying the \u2018substantive\u2019 importance of\nYoung People\u2019s Entry into Higher Education 13\nthe effect of occupational social class in a form that we would argue is easily communi-\ncated and understood.\nDISCUSSION\nSocial Class\nAn important \u008e nding is that, after educational attainment has been controlled for, the\noccupational social class of a young person\u2019s family is highly statistically signi\u008e cant.\nThe observed shortfall increases as we move down the occupational social class groups.\nThe sample enumeration methodology indicates that the estimated shortfall due to the\nclass effect for each of the social classes remains around 3%. Overall, these \u008e ndings\nremain consistent with the theoretical claim that young people from less advantaged\nsocial backgrounds are less likely to enter higher education and study degree level\ncourses. Through sample enumeration we can report that when measured by parental\noccupational status only, social class accounts for just a small proportion of the\ndifference in the participation rates in degree level education. This is an important\n\u008e nding as it warns against an account of the effects of social class upon \u008e lial partici-\npation in degree level education that uncritically relies upon parental occupational\nstatus as the sole measure of social class.\nGender Effects\nA further important \u008e nding, given the government\u2019s concerns about access and equality\nof opportunity, is that young women in this cohort were less likely to enter higher\neducation than their male counterparts. The observed rate of participation by young\nmen was 17% compared to the 13% entry rate for young women. Through sample\nenumeration the estimated rate of female participation was 16%, an increase of 3%.\nAgain, this is analogous to moving the young women into the male category and then\nexamining the combined effects of the other explanatory variables.\nThis observed difference in entry rates between young men and women was 4%.\nTherefore the estimated shortfall due to the gender effect was 3% and the combined\neffect of the other variables was 1%. This is an important \u008e nding in terms of policy\nformulation because the difference between males and females can mostly be attributed\nto the gender effect. This indicates that, largely, the difference in participation rates\ncould plausibly be attributed to gender discrimination. However, our results are\nuninformative as to the nature and the process by which discrimination may operate.\nHaving only analysed data from a single cohort of young people, at the present time,\nwe cannot be sure how universal the gender effect \u008e nding is.\nEthnicity Effects\nThe point that must be stressed is that in our analysis ethnicity, per se, is not statistically\nsigni\u008e cant. Taken on its own this can be misleading as various ethnic groups have\ndifferential rates of participations in higher education. Expressed descriptively, young\npeople of Indian origin have the highest rates of participation with approximately a\nquarter studying for a degree. The next highest rate was young people of Pakistani\norigin, closely followed by White young people. About 14% of young people from these\nethnic backgrounds were studying for a degree. Less than 10% of Bangladeshi and\n14 Oxford Review of Education\nBlack, African or Afro-Caribbean young people were studying for a degree. The\ngovernment is already aware of these differences and in particular the lower rates of\nparticipation by Bangladeshis and Afro Caribbeans [1].\nThe most obvious substantive point that we wish to highlight is that any analysis that\ncombines young people of Asian origin (i.e. those of Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi\norigin) is likely to lead to misleading conclusions. The next caveat that we must issue\nis that there were small numbers of young people in some of these ethnic groups. The\nfact that young people of Indian origin are more successful in terms of rates of\nparticipation in higher education goes against simple arguments that are premised upon\nthe existence of discrimination within the education system. Whilst we do not wish to\ndiscount the effects of discrimination tout court we wish to warn against simplistic\nclaims.\nThe observed rate of young people of Indian origin entering higher education is 26%\ncompared to a rate of only 15% for young people of non-Indian origin (Table VI). The\nsample enumeration methodology estimates that 23% of non-Indian young people\nwould attend higher education if they behaved like their counterparts of Indian origin.\nThis represents an increased rate of 8%. The observed shortfall between these groups\nwas 11%. We can conclude that 8% of the observed shortfall is due to the ethnicity\neffect and 3% is due to the combined effect of the other explanatory variables. Sample\nenumeration indicates that the majority of the difference in the entry rates to higher\neducation for these two groups is accounted for by the ethnicity variable. Sociologically,\nthis is an important \u008e nding since the difference between young people of Indian origin\nand other young people is largely associated with their ethnicity. Sociologically what is\nrequired, therefore, is a more comprehensive and subtle investigation of the relevance\nof this difference.\nA point of caution must be raised at this point, however. Our analysis uses a measure\nfrom the YCS that combines all young people of Indian origin. This combines Hindus,\nMuslims and Sikhs as well as young people from East Africa who might also consider\nthemselves as being of Indian origin. It is plausible to assume that these sub-groups\nmight be distinctively different in terms of their educational progress. A further caveat\nis that the measure contained within the YCS also does not distinguish young people\nborn in Britain from those born overseas. Again, this presents a problem as we might\nplausibly expect that native and non-native English speakers would have different\neducational experiences.\nParental Education and Independent Schooling\nThere is a substantively interesting relationship between parental education and attend-\nance at an Independent school [2]. Examining the parameter estimates (see Table VII)\nwe can conclude that for a young person who attends an Independent school having\nnon-graduate parents does not have a large effect on the likelihood that they will be\nTABLE VII. Parental education by school attendance (odds ratios)\nAttended independent school Attended state school\nGraduate parents 1 0.78\nNon-graduate parents 0.93 0.44\nYoung People\u2019s Entry into Higher Education 15\nstudying for a degree. Similarly, attending a state school does not appear to have a large\neffect on the likelihood of a young person with graduate parents studying for a degree.\nYoung people who attended state schools and did not have graduate parents had the\nlowest likelihood of studying for a degree.\nConceptually, these results can be considered another way. Attending an Indepen-\ndent school increases a young person\u2019s likelihood of studying for a degree. At the same\ntime, having graduate parents increases a young person\u2019s likelihood of studying for a\ndegree. The increased likelihood of studying for a degree for those young people who\nhave graduate parents and attended an Independent school is not equivalent to the sum\nof the individual positive effects of these two factors. Given the magnitude of these\neffects an interesting question is posed with regard to the value of Independent\neducation for young people with graduate parents.\nOnce again, through sample enumeration we are able to quantify the effects of\nindividual explanatory factors. At \u008e rst sight the strength of the parental education and\nIndependent schooling factors appears to be large (see Table IV). The \u008e gures reported\nin Table VI indicate that both parental education and the school effect account for a\nsmall amount of the observed shortfalls in the entry rates to higher education.\nWhilst young people with graduate parents are socially advantaged (a higher pro-\nportion were studying for a degree) this effect was smaller than we initially assumed.\nSimilarly, young people who attended Independent schools have increased social\nadvantage, and therefore a higher entry rates into higher education, but again this effect\nis smaller than we initially assumed.\nWe have highlighted the inter-related nature of schooling and parental education and\nour conclusion is that any substantive interpretation must be aware of the signi\u008e cant\ninteraction between these factors. This government and their predecessors have both\nexpressed concerns about educational standards and school effectiveness [3]. Our\n\u008e ndings highlight the dangers of any simplistic analysis of the effects of schooling upon\nentry to higher education that does not take account of parental education.\nOther Factors\nIncreased family size is also important. All other things being equal, young people from\nlarger families have a lower chance of studying for a degree. Turning our attention to\nhome ownership, 17% of young people whose parents owned their own home were\nstudying for a degree, in contrast to only 5% of young people whose parents were not\nhomeowners. The sample enumeration methodology estimated a participation rate of\n7% for those young people whose parents were not homeowners. This increase of 2%\nillustrates the small effect of home ownership. Whilst home ownership is not a direct\nindicator of social background it does, however, represent increased family wealth and\nimproved material conditions.\nWithin the sociology of youth there is much concern about young people\u2019s lifestyles\nand transitions from youth to more permanent modes of adult status (see McDonald\net al., 1993; Irwin, 1995; Gayle, 1998). The analysis of marital status reports low levels\nof participation in degree level education by those who marry early. This is an\nimportant \u008e nding as it emphasises that young people who marry early tend to opt out\nof continuing into higher education. However, through sample enumeration we can\nconclude that this is a small effect. Any comprehensive understanding of the effect of\nearly marriage on entry into higher education must be cognisant of the fact that only a\nsmall proportion of the difference in entry rates can be explained by early marriage.\n16 Oxford Review of Education\nCONCLUSION\nSubstantive Conclusion\nThe central message of this paper is that there is a need for comprehensive and\nsystematic analysis of the factors that in\u008f uence young people\u2019s entry into higher\neducation and participation in degree level courses if the government is to develop\n\u2018evidence based\u2019 policy initiatives.\nHalsey (1993) argues that class, gender and ethnicity are now the three giants in the\npath of aspirations toward equality of access to higher education. Overall, our results\nhave emphasised that class, gender and ethnicity are important but there are a complex\nand inter-related set of factors that in\u008f uence young people\u2019s entry into higher edu-\ncation. The answer to our primary research question namely, \u2018net of attainment, do\nexternal in\u008f uences such as family\u2019s social class, parental education, gender and ethnic-\nity in\u008f uence a young persons chance of studying for a degree?\u2019 is unequivocally \u2018yes\u2019.\nHowever, the \u2018direct\u2019 effects of many of these factors are less important than we initially\nassumed.\nThe government have stated that their priority is to reach out to groups that are\nunder-represented in higher education. This includes young people from families with\nsemi-skilled and unskilled occupational backgrounds. Our analysis has reported that the\ndifferences in participation in degree level education by young people from these social\ngroups are only partially explained by their parent\u2019s occupational class status. The\ncorollary of this being that policy initiatives aimed at combating the differential levels\nof entry into higher education will have to embrace a more comprehensive conception\nof differences than is afforded by more restrictive occupational social class analysis.\nIn the analysis above, we have reported a signi\u008e cant gender effect. British higher\neducation can boast a minor success in terms of increasing women\u2019s access to higher\neducation. Women now account for over 50% of the students in higher education but\nthe government is aware of the gender imbalance across subject disciplines [4]. The\naggregate \u008e gures might occlude the picture for young women as they include mature\nfemale students, so we counsel against complacency on this important issue.\nThe complexity of examining the effects of ethnicity has been raised in this analysis.\nThe effects of ethnicity per se are not dramatic and do not capture the differences in\nparticipation rates across ethnic groups. Policy initiatives designed to increase partici-\npation by certain ethnic groups will have to be sensitive to the more subtle nuances of\nthe effects of ethnicity.\nWe have also pointed to some of the issues associated with the measurement of\nethnicity and the shortcomings of existing measures. These issues are well known and,\npresently, much sociological analysis in bedevilled by these problems. Prudent govern-\nment policy will be sensitive to the limitation of social research in this area.\nThe effect of parental education on \u008e lial entry to higher education is inter-woven\nwith the effects of schooling. These \u008e ndings are consistent with the theoretical claim\nthat increased parental education and independent schooling both provide greater\nlevels of social advantage. On our evidence, it is probable that the offspring of the\ncurrent bulge in student numbers may also have a high likelihood of entering higher\neducation. In view of this, forecasting the future demand for higher education will\npresent a challenging set of problems for planners.\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s saw a huge expansion in the number of mature\nstudents. Presently, increasing numbers of people are entering higher education later\nand mature students make up a large proportion of full-time degree students (HEFCE,\nYoung People\u2019s Entry into Higher Education 17\n1996). In light of our analysis it is plausible to assume that the offspring of these mature\nstudents are also more likely to want to enter higher education than they might have\nbeen had their parents not become graduates. In terms of planning for future demand\nthis presents a vexing, and more immediate problem.\nMethodological Conclusion\nWe are keen to point out that these results are derived from cross-sectional analysis and\ntherefore are relatively uninformative about social processes [5]. In future analysis we\nare keen to exploit the longitudinal nature of the YCS data in an attempt to uncover\nthe processes underpinning young people\u2019s entry into higher education. At this stage we\nhave been able to emphasise the importance of a number of factors but we are not in\na secure position to draw conclusions about the temporal stability of these effects. The\nobvious solution to this is to pool cohorts of data from the YCS in order to compare\nthe behaviour of young people over time.\nThe analysis that we have presented offers a clear example of the bene\u008e ts of sample\nenumeration for the interpretation of logistic regression models. Goldstein (1993)\nconcludes that one of the useful things about statistical models of educational realities\nis that, so long as the assumptions are clearly and correctly stated, one can obtain\nreliable conclusions that in their own terms are beyond reproach. He further states that\nwhat makes things dif\u008e cult is that trying to communicate results within the social\nscience community is fraught with dif\u008e culties even when the attempt is genuinely one\nof honest communication.\nAn overall attraction of sample enumeration methods is that by quantifying effects\ndirectly, and in a tractable fashion, researchers are able to assess the \u2018substantive\u2019 rather\nthan the \u2018statistical\u2019 importance of explanatory variables. Sample enumeration methods\nalso provide a means of reporting the effects of individual explanatory variables in a\nmanner that is communicable to researchers whose interests are primarily substantive\nrather than methodological. A further bene\u008e t is that results are also easily communi-\ncated to non-academic audiences with no experience of interpreting the results from\nstatistical models. Sample enumeration methods also provide a mechanism for com-\nparing the effects of variables in different (i.e. non-nested) logistic regression models.\nExtensions of the method to the interpretation of longitudinal data are also feasible\n(Davies, 1992).\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was undertaken as part of an Economic and Social Research Council,\nAnalysis of Large and Complex Datasets, Phase II Visiting Fellowship Award (H519 44\n5002 97).
