Concern with \u2018the multicultural\u2019 is typically \nconfigured in response to particular socio-historical conditions. For example, in the \naftermath of the Cantle (2001) report and its suggestion that the urban riots of 2001 in \nthe north of England were due to segregation and a lack of social cohesion, Britain, \nwhich provides the context of the present study, has seen shifts in multicultural policy \ntowards a discourse of integration (Worley, 2005). At the same time, \u2018integration\u2019 has \nemerged as an idealized response to diversity according to social psychological \nframeworks investigating acculturation in a variety of cultural contexts. It is the issue \nof acculturation that the present paper takes as its critical focus. \n \nAcculturation research in social psychology  \nAcculturation has come to occupy an increasingly prominent position in psychology, \nfrequently being positioned as an area where psychological enquiry might contribute \nto our understanding of immigration and cultural diversity (e.g. Arends-T\u00f3th & van de \nVijver, 2003; Berry, 2001; Bourhis, Mo\u00efse, Perreault & Sen\u00e9cal, 1997; van de Vijver \n& Phalet, 2004; Zick, Wagner, Dick & Petzel, 2001). Definitions of acculturation \ntypically orient to a process of prolonged intergroup contact between two or more \ncultural groups and the changes that this purportedly brings in both parties (in line \nwith Redfield, Linton and Herskovits\u2019, 1936, definition). Before critically engaging \nwith traditional acculturation research, it is important firstly to outline some of its \ncentral assumptions.  \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 4\nAcculturation research has persistently located its findings within a \ntypological discourse of the kind so prevalent in traditional personality psychology \n(Rudmin, 2003, makes a similar point from a positivistic standpoint). The key concern \nhas been with identifying people\u2019s orientations to acculturation and how these relate \nto psychological adaptation. In this respect, the frameworks offered by Berry and \ncolleagues (for example, 1990, 1997) have been particularly influential. Berry\u2019s work \nfollows in the footsteps of a series of papers which have historically conceived of \nacculturation as a taxonomy of four types, reflecting the assumed possibility of an \nindividual\u2019s positive or negative reaction to ontologically prior \u2018majority\u2019 and \n\u2018minority\u2019 cultures \u2013 that is, at a basic level, whether they accept or reject each culture \n(Rudmin, 2003). The precise nature of these reactions (whether they reflect attitudes, \nfeelings or identifications) tends to vary in accordance with the particular context of \neach study but, nevertheless, they are consistently considered to determine the kind of \nacculturation strategy a person supports. Berry\u2019s early work, for example, takes an \nindividual\u2019s position on a fourfold taxonomy of acculturation \u2018strategies\u2019\/\u2018attitudes\u2019 to \nbe determined by their intersecting attitudes to cultural maintenance (defined as the \ndegree to which they wish to retain elements of their own group in the face of \nintercultural relations) and cultural contact (defined as the degree to which they wish \nto have or avoid contact with other groups). \nStudies adopting this framework take answers to response-restricted questions \nsuch as \u201cHow important is it for you to maintain your culture?\u201d as the legitimate basis \nfor making typological classifications (see Berry, 1997, for a review of research on \nthe fourfold taxonomy). Those who provide positive responses to questions regarding \nthe need to maintain their own culture and the need for inter-cultural contact are \nconsequently identified as supporters of integration. Positive responses to questions \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 5\nof cultural contact and negative responses to cultural maintenance are taken to reflect \nsupport for assimilation. Separation is contrastingly defined by negative responses to \nthe question of cultural contact and positive responses to cultural maintenance, while \nmarginalization is the label applied where negative responses are obtained for both \nquestions. Furthermore, it has been by establishing relationships between \u2018positive \npsychological adaptation\u2019 and \u2018integration\u2019 (Berry, 1997; Berry, Kim, Minde, & \nMok,1987; Flannery, Reise & Yu, 2001) that integration has come to be privileged as \nthe optimal acculturation strategy. \n \nLimitations \nHowever, problems persist. The typological discourse (re-)produces a static and de-\ncontextualized account of acculturation. Not only are participants methodologically \nfixed into a limited range of supposedly mutually exclusive positions (integrationist, \nassimilationist, etc.) but these positions are assumed to reflect the same underlying \nattitudes within and across particular studies. It is assumed, for example, that positive \nreactions to cultural adaptation and cultural maintenance represent support for \nintegration regardless of cultural context, that the meaning of integration is similarly \nstable and that consequently this body of literature can be seen to support its \nrecommendation. This persists in spite of the fact that such studies take place in \ndisparate socio-historical settings. In rigidly applying the typological acculturation \nmodel, they therefore run the risk of failing to understand cultural diversity in terms \nof the particular systems of meaning in which it is oriented to. Furthermore, it endures \nin spite of acknowledged historical variation (Rudmin, 2003) in the nature of these \nacculturation typologies (that is, in what the \u2018endorsement\u2019 of dominant and minority \ncultures is actually taken to refer to) and despite the fact that different models \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 6\nconceptualize the attitudes supposedly underlying particular acculturation stances in \nvery different ways (see Liebkind, 2001).  \nA second major criticism is that the typological discourse focuses our attention \nfirmly on the individual in a manner which threatens to remove responsibility for \nparticular forms of multicultural relations from wider, collectively driven, socio-\npolitical forces. Locating, for example, the desire for integration or assimilation \nwithin the individual risks reifying the particular acculturation construct, whilst \nglossing over its social construction and functions within wider systems of meaning. \nThe lack of concern with the way participants orient to and engage in the functional \nconstruction of the acculturation process serves to remove variability from the \nequation. The possibility for contestation and re-configuration is shut down in ways \nwhich risk glossing over the collective practices involved in morally privileging or \ndenigrating particular acculturation \u2018strategies\u2019.  \nMoreover, the tendency to concentrate on the acculturation strategies of \nminority group members downplays the role of \u2018the majority\u2019 and locates \nresponsibility for the outcomes of intercultural contact with those whose ability to \ninfluence acculturation may be constrained by wider hegemonic structures. Though a \nnumber of authors in recent years have sought to acknowledge the impact of the \ndominant ingroup on acculturation (Berry, 2001; Bourhis et al., 1997; Florack, \nPiontowski, Rohmann, Balzer & Perzig, 2003; Montreuil & Bourhis, 2001; \nPiontowksi, Rohmann & Florack, 2002) the conceptualization of interaction has in \npractice, been a rather static one. Rather than focus on the performative functionality \nof the way that subjects negotiate and contest acculturation together in everyday \ninteractional settings, the focus tends instead to be on comparing the typological \nclassifications of minority and majority acculturation strategies. Concordance or \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 7\ndiscordance is then attributed on the basis of this comparison (see Piontowski, 2002). \nIn  practice, a vision of interaction is (re-)produced which not only reifies distinctions \nbetween \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 but also privileges the maintenance of the status quo. The \nimplicit emphasis on conflict resolution might unwittingly provide legitimization for \nsegregation and social division under the auspices of \u2018harmonious\u2019 intergroup contact \n(that is, by demonstrating that this is a \u2018consensus\u2019 perspective). At an implicit level, \nit might also be seen to de-legitimize challenges to dominant discourses of \nacculturation, resonating therefore with the sense of conformity underlying \nassimilationism. \n \nAssimilating acculturation within a critical discursive framework \nMore nuanced approaches to cultural diversity have recently been developed within \nmainstream social psychological frameworks by researchers such as Chryssochoou \n(2000, 2004). This work has been particularly helpful in shifting attention to the \nsocial (re-)production of the \u2018lay theories\u2019 by way of which people understand inter-\nrelated aspects of cultural diversity (for example, integration and superordinate \ncategory constructs). However, its privileging of a social representations framework \n(for example, Moscovici, 1988) has encouraged an underlying cognitivism which, in \npractice, has de-emphasized an analytic attention to the performative aspects of \naccounts of cultural diversity and group membership (that is, the social actions they \nare designed to accomplish).  \nDrawing on both micro- and macro-level social psychological approaches to \ndiscourse analysis and rhetoric (Billig, 1995; Billig et al., 1988; Edwards & Potter, \n1992; Parker, 1992; Potter, 1996; Potter & Wetherell, 1987; Wetherell & Potter, \n1992) in a vein recently called for by a number of researchers (Edley, 2001; Edley & \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 8\nWetherell, 1999, 2001; Wetherell, 1998), our perspective therefore shifts to \nexamining the global patterns of acculturation discourses as they are rhetorically \nconfigured to accomplish a variety of action-oriented, micro-level social actions. The \nfocus is on the ways in which particular accounts of acculturation are constructed to \nachieve particular argumentative effects. This is not to suggest that acculturative \nmatters have yet to be discussed from a broadly social constructionist perspective, nor \nindeed that they have escaped the attentions of discourse analysts.  \nBhatia (2002) has employed a dialogical model of acculturation in order to \nexamine the negotiation of the diasporic self \u2013 \u2018a constant moving back and forth \nbetween incompatible cultural positions\u2019 (p.57) \u2013 in a manner which explicitly \nchallenges the traditional typological approach. More attentive to rhetorical function, \nVan Dijk (1997) has oriented to assimilation and integration as features of racist \nrhetoric directed towards blaming the victim for negative other-representation (based \non \u2018their\u2019 failure to adapt). Moreover, Verkuyten and de Wolf (2002) acknowledge \nthe need to understand \u2018acculturation modes\u2019 as part of discursive practice. Their \nfocus, however, is the manner in which ethnic self-definitions are contextually \nnegotiated rather than the wider action-oriented negotiation and deployment of \nacculturation discourses. The present research contrastingly treats the micro-level \nconstruction and functions of these broader interpretative resources as a substantive \nconcern worthy of a more systematic analysis in itself. \nThis concern is supplemented by a macro-level attention to more global \npatterns of acculturation discourse and their implications for power relations. That is, \nattention to local level discursive practice occurs in tandem with concerns over the \npervasiveness of particular repertoires and what might be gleaned from this regarding \nexisting power structures and the \u2018taken for granted\u2019 (Edley & Wetherell, 2001).  \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 9\nSuch an approach provides a fluid rather than static conception of \nacculturation. Placing an analytic emphasis on the kinds of variability which confound \ntraditional acculturation research1, it allows us to examine how particular positions are \naccepted\/contested in discursive practice, in tandem with the meaning with which \nthey are rhetorically imbued. This perspective leads us to question the way in which \npositions of dominance are negotiated and re-produced rather than simply being \ntreated as pre-ordained givens. In shifting our focus to the interplay between \ndiscursive repertoire and occasioned deployment, the problems encountered by the \nunderlying individualism of traditional acculturation research are avoided. Rather, we \nare encouraged to examine how the micro-level negotiation of culturally shared \ndiscourses of integration or assimilation, for example, has wider connotations for each \nof the implicated parties.  \nThe present study focuses its attentions on the way in which integration is \nconstructed and the functions it serves in media debate surrounding calls for more \nstate-funded faith schools in Britain. The decision to concentrate on faith schooling \narose from a preliminary engagement with our wider data set, and, as such, is \ncontextualized in the following section. The reason for the specific focus on texts \norienting to integration is not only practical. Alongside the aforementioned \nprivileging of integration within traditional acculturation research, a series of papers \nfocusing on policy rhetoric (Lewis, 2005; Worley, 2005; Yuval-Davis, Anthias & \nKofman, 2005) has noted that, in trying to manage dilemmas of tolerance and control, \nthe present British government has shifted to a rhetoric of integration which Lewis \nand Neal (2005) suggest has \u201cbeen a partial shift away from affirmations of British \n                                                 \n1 More recent adaptations of these traditional acculturation frameworks have commendably attempted \nto address the context dependency of acculturation \u2018strategies\u2019 (for example, Navas et al.\u2019s, 2005, \nRelative Acculturation Extended Model). However, the suggestion that different acculturative positions \nmay be taken in relation to a limited range of domains (work, family relations and so on) orients to a \nfairly static conception of context. \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 10\nmulticulture towards a (re)embracing of older notions of assimilationism within a \nnewer, de-racialized language of social cohesion\u201d (p.437). The drive of integrationism \ntowards homogeneity has been noted elsewhere in other socio-cultural contexts \n(Blommaert, 1997; Blommaert & Verschueren, 1998). The present paper extends this \nfocus to a discourse analysis of its everyday, micro-political manifestation. \n \nBackground and method \nThe following analysis draws on newspaper materials obtained as part of a wider \nproject concerned with discourses of acculturation in the mainstream British print \nmedia. In focusing our attentions on the mainstream press in this way, our assumption \nwas not that a sample drawn from this source is necessarily representative of wider \npublic opinion. Nor do we consider it advisable to take a reductively deterministic \nview of \u2018media influence\u2019 on, for example, the kinds of discourses reproduced in \neveryday interactional settings. Rather, our focus on the mainstream British press \nmore modestly intended to provide an opportunity to sample and analytically engage \nwith a range of culturally available acculturation-based interpretative resources as \nthey were rhetorically deployed in the everyday print media negotiation of particular \nmulticultural issues.  \nIn order to sample daily reproductions of acculturation discourse in the \nmainstream British press, we collected newspapers every day over a three-week \nperiod between May and June 2004. Our interest in delineating everyday acculturation \ndiscourses encouraged us to resist intentionally sampling a period either \nretrospectively or based on assumptions regarding the kinds of issues likely to arise. \nInstead we selected a random three-week period with the view that this might provide \nus with a snapshot of the routine occurrence of acculturation-based discursive \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 11\npractices in the mainstream national press. The materials analyzed were derived from \nThe Daily Mail, The Daily Mirror, The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and The Sun. \nSampling also included the Sunday versions of these publications (The Mail on \nSunday, The Sunday Mirror, The Sunday Telegraph, The Observer and The News of \nthe World). Papers were chosen on the basis that they represent a range of political \nopinion whilst covering both \u2018high-brow\u2019 and populist interests. \nAll articles considered to broadly orient to issues surrounding \n\u2018multiculturalism\u2019 in Britain were photocopied in preparation for further analysis. \nThis produced a data set of over 250 articles, which were then included in the \nsubsequent coding stage of our analysis. The aim of coding at this stage was to render \nthe data set manageable and identify key emergent themes in a manner which would \nfacilitate a subsequent, more systematic analysis. In this paper, we have chosen to \nfocus specifically on the deployment of discourses of integration in relation to debate \nconcerning the provision of state support for schools run by religious bodies. This \ndecision rests on two main concerns. The first is pragmatic. An eclectic range of \nissues was found to be defined and regulated in terms of integrationism \u2013 from \nfootball supportership and national identification to asylum, immigration and the \nEuropean Union. Providing a coherent analytic discussion of integrationist discourse \nas tangled up in this broad-ranging set of multicultural issues would require \ncontextualisation and elaboration beyond the confines of the present article. By \nfocusing on the faith schooling issue \u2013 an issue which itself represented a substantial \nproportion of the wider data set (42 articles) \u2013 it is hoped that some of the broader \npatterns evidenced in our data set might be delineated in order to permit a more \ncoherent, concise and structured discussion. \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 12\n Secondly, the issue of state-funded Islamic schooling has been flagged by \nwork in other disciplines as an arena where Muslim claim-making might be revealing \n(through the potential challenge it poses) of the hegemonic structures underpinning \nparticular discourses of multiculturalism, most particularly in the form of an \napparently secular bias said to be resistant to religious equality (Modood, 2003; \nStatham, Koopmans, Giugni & Passi, 2005). However, while the dilemmatics of faith \nschooling have recently been navigated by work in political philosophy and sociology \ninterested in developing approaches to \u2018multiculturalism\u2019 that are more sensitive to \nreligious (particularly Muslim) concerns (for example, Modood, 2005; Parekh, 2000), \nthe discursive practices which sustain arguments for and against faith schooling have \nrarely been examined in terms of their everyday media deployment.  \nThis seems somewhat surprising given the perpetual re-emergence of faith \nschooling as a matter of media concern in recent years. Following changes in \nlegislation brought about by the 1993 Education Act, it has been possible for private \nschools run by Muslims and other faith-based groups to apply to enter the state sector \n(Walford, 2000). However, it has been the current British government\u2019s drive for \nmore specialist schools which respond to the needs of the individual and with it the \nencouragement of more faith-based schools (DfEE, 2001) that has sparked recurring \ndebate2 within the British media (Valins, 2003). This debate was re-ignited at the time \nof our sample by the presentation of the Muslims on Education report to the House of \nLords on June 9th, 2004. The paper \u2013 jointly prepared by the Association of Muslim \nScientists (AMSS UK), the Forum Against Islamophobia and Racism (FAIR UK), \nFED 2000 (For Education and Development) and the Muslim College UK \u2013 expressed \nconcerns regarding an \u2018imbalance\u2019 in the availability of state-funding for Muslim \n                                                 \n2 Debate has been revived on numerous occasions since \u2013 in March 2006, for example, after the \nArchbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, at a speech to the National Church Schools \nconference, argued that faith schools play a key role in developing community cohesion.  \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 13\nschools (relative to other religious denominations). The ensuing debate yielded \narticles which contested the merits of state-supported faith schooling along lines \nfrequently defined and regulated in terms of integrationist discourse.  \nThe criterion for analytic inclusion in this data sub-set was simply that faith \nschooling had to be flagged as a relevant concern. Alongside commentary articles, we \nalso examined extracts positioned as both news reports and letters to the editor in \norder to sample the occurrence of integrationist discourse across the wider fabric of \nthe daily newspapers.   \nRelatedly, however, it should be noted that though the resulting data set \nevidenced both pro- and anti- state-funded faith schooling arguments, the latter were \nfar more prevalent. Moreover, few articles were explicitly tied to Muslim \u2018voices\u2019. \nThis relative lack of variability should not simply be seen as a sampling flaw. Rather \nit may be indicative of the accessibility of certain speaking positions within the \nmainstream British media in relation to issues such as faith schooling.  \n \nAnalytic Framework  \nAs noted earlier, analysis drew upon recent attempts (Edley, 2001; Edley & \nWetherell, 1999, 2001; Wetherell, 1998) to a marry a micro-level attention to the local \norganization of accounts and rhetorically-directed construction of meaning (Edwards \n& Potter, 1992; Potter & Wetherell, 1987) with a broader concern with patterns of \nculturally available meaning and their implications for relations of power and \ndominance (for example, Parker, 1992; Wetherell & Potter, 1992). This involved \npaying close attention to the ways in which accounts were constructed and the action-\noriented rhetorical functions served by particular uses of language. However, as Edley \n(2001) points out, while concepts such as \u2018hegemony\u2019 may go unmentioned in a \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 14\nparticular piece of talk or text, their influence may nevertheless be felt as they sit \nimplicitly on a text\u2019s fringes. The potential banality of constructions of integration \nwas borne in mind such that we were led to look beyond the seeming triviality of its \ninvocation (\u00e0 la Billig, 1995). In orienting to the potentially inexplicit workings of \nintegrationism, the assumption \u2013 as with more critical realist approaches to discourse \nanalysis (for example, Parker 1992) \u2013 was therefore made (in agreement with Edley \nand Wetherell, 2001) that discourses may take on stable patterns potentially bound up \nwith particular socio-political contexts and institutions. A micro-level analysis \nprovided grounding for a more Foucauldian-level attention to the broader patterning \nof interpretative resources and their more global implications, thereby  permitting the \noccasioned configuration of these discourses to be explored. While it is acknowledged \nthat these interpretations are inextricably linked with our own speaking positions, the \nprovision of extracts is intended to provide a means of assessing the persuasiveness of \nthese interpretations from alternative positions. The extracts presented here were \nselected on the basis that they reflect wider patterns of integrationist discourse \nimplicated in negotiating pro- and anti-faith schooling arguments. Material omitted \nfrom the original source for reasons of space is denoted by three bracketed ellipsis \npoints (\u2026).  \nAnalysis \nThe analysis is split into three sub-sections. The first deals with the manner in which \nintegration was consistently positioned as the acculturative moral good. It attempts to \ndemonstrate the way in which privileging integration provided a rhetorical platform \noriented to fulfilling a variety of micro-level functions (garnering a liberal footing, \nidentifying transgression and so on). The second section attends to the socio-spatial \nundertones of integrationist discourse. In doing this, it responds to recent calls for a \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 15\ndiscursive focus on the role of place in everyday argumentation (Dixon & Durrheim, \n2000; Wallwork & Dixon, 2004). A final section deals with the assimilative \nundertones of integration discourses, providing a more macro-level discussion of the \nimplications for power relations between those groups occupying centre stage in the \nmulticultural debates sampled by our data set \u2013 that is, between Muslims and a non-\nMuslim \u2018mainstream\u2019 in Britain.  \n \nIdealizing integration \nA common pattern that emerged across the data set was an orientation to the capacity \nof faith schools to fulfil certain acculturative \u2018responsibilities\u2019. Anti-faith schooling \narguments and, indeed, the relatively few pro-faith schooling arguments evidenced in \nour sample, oriented to taken-for-granted moral orders. At a global level these \nappeared to reflect a hierarchy of acceptability in accordance with which integration \nwas idealized, while social division and segregation were positioned as transgressive. \nA brief consideration of the following extracts helps exemplify this wider pattern:  \nExtract 1: The Daily Mail (10\/06\/04) \u2013 News Report by Sarah Harris \nMUSLIM children are being failed by the state education system and need more \nfaith-based schools, academics and education experts claimed yesterday.  \nThey said the country\u2019s largest minority community should have access to more \nMuslim state schools\u2026 \n\u2026In a report they claimed that \u2018institutional racism\u2019 was preventing more Muslim \nschools being set up.  \n\u2018There are still major Muslim populations that are not served by any suitable \neducation service, state or private,\u2019 said the document.  \nIts authors called for the private Muslim schools to be \u2018fast tracked\u2019 into the state \nsector. This would be highly controversial as critics argue that faith schools prevent \nintegration into the local community\u2026 \n\u2026Kurshid Ahmed, of the Commission for Racial Equality, admitted state education \nfor Muslims could be improved but warned that faith schools prevented integration.  \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 16\nThey were labelled \u2018an easy copout\u2019 by Labour MP Andrew Bennett who headed a \ncommittee of MPs which investigated race riots and suggested that Muslim schools \ncaused social division. \nExtract 2: The Guardian (11\/06\/04) \u2013 Commentary Article by Polly Toynbee \nThe small Muslim population \u2013 under 3% nationwide \u2013 now has more regular mosque \nattenders than there are CofE (Church of England) church goers. With 26 CofE \nbishops passing laws in the House of Lords and so many Christian state schools, the \ninjustice of it is no longer sustainable. We expect Muslims to integrate, and yet offer \nthem a model of society that deliberately excludes them. The answer, as secularists \nalways said, is for the state to abolish all faith schools\u2026 \nExtract 3: The Guardian (16\/06\/04) - Letters \n\u2026I support Polly Toynbee's call for integrated cross-cultural schools, but she \nprivileges one particular belief system \u2013 atheism \u2013 above all others. Anti-religious \nfundamentalism may be just as divisive in our education system as the religious \nvarieties.  \nJonathan Schofield \nWorcester \n \nIn extracts 1 and 2, for example, \u201cintegration\u201d is implicitly optimalized by way of the \nnegative reaction with which its \u2018prevention\u2019 is met. For example, in orienting to an \n\u2018expectation\u2019 that Muslims should \u201cintegrate\u201d, extract 2 (re-)produces an acculturative \norder in which integration is optimalized (in a manner reified by the condemnation of \nits prevention) while exclusion is positioned as unjust. In extract 1, the prevention of \n\u201cintegration\u201d warrants \u201cwarning\u201d in a manner which problematizes that which is \npositioned as a barrier (\u201cfaith schools\u201d). By condemning the obstruction of \n\u201cintegration\u201d, \u201cintegration\u201d itself becomes morally privileged, a state that should be \nfacilitated rather than impeded. Moreover, the nature of this prevention is elaborated \nin a manner which contrastingly orients to the attribution of \u201csocial division\u201d as a \nform of self-evident criticism and implicitly acts as explanation for the Muslim \nschool\u2019s obstruction of \u201cintegration\u201d (\u201c\u2026suggested that Muslim schools caused social \ndivision\u201d). Of course, the attribution of this integrationist discourse to a series of \nexternally located \u2018independent\u2019 voices through the demarcation of reported speech \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 17\n(\u201cKurshid Ahmed, of the Commission for Racial Equality, admitted\u2026\u201d) forms part of \nthe wider construction of neutrality characteristic of news \u2018reporting\u2019  (Potter, 1996). \nPossible charges of partiality are countered by presenting a multiplicity of positions \u2013\nboth pro- (\u201cthey claimed that \u2018institutional racism\u2019 was preventing more Muslim \nschools being set up\u201d) and anti- faith schooling \u2013 in a manner which upholds the \narticle as a balanced representation of \u2018the facts\u2019 rather than one biased by personal \nopinion. \nThe assumed acculturative moral order provided a legitimizing basis for anti-\nfaith schooling arguments: faith schools were either constructed as inhibitors of \nintegration and facilitators of social division (as in extract 1) or else attempts were \nsimply made to undermine faith schools\u2019 claims to facilitate integration. In extract 2, \nthe optimalization of integration serves clear rhetorical functions, providing the \nlegitimizing basis of a call for \u201cthe state to abolish all faith schools\u201d. Quantitatively-\nformulated inequalities between Muslims and CofE church goers (for example, \u201cso \nmany Christian state schools\u201d) are implicitly presented as an exclusionary barrier to \n\u2018integration\u2019 (\u201cthe injustice of it\u2026\u201d, \u201ca model of society that deliberately excludes\u201d). \nIn this context, abolishing faith schools is positioned as a numerically equalizing act \nand therefore a move towards a fetishized equivalence whereby \u2018integration\u2019 might, \naccording to this formulation (by implicit contrast) be made possible. As such, \nintegrationism can be seen to intersect with rhetorical resources of \u2018equality\u2019, the \nmobilization of which is designed in this case to frame support for negative action \n(that is, taking away faith schools from Christians) as liberally congruent and \ninclusionary (such that support for Muslim state-schools is \u2018reasonably\u2019 avoided).   \nThese extracts notably evidence a general lack of engagement with the \nmeaning of integration, alongside a failure to qualify its privileged positioning, \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 18\nserving to lend integration an air of taken-for-granted self-evidence such that it is \nimplicitly imbued with the rhetorical weight of common sense. In extract 3, for \nexample, the assertion of support for \u201cPolly Toynbee\u2019s call for integrated schools\u201d3 \nworks as something of a disclaimer. It is oriented to as evidence of the argument\u2019s \nreasonableness \u2013 a sense of even-handedness being worked up through the \ndemonstration of a willingness to make concessions of support where the \u2018common-\nsense\u2019good of integrationism dictates necessary. As such, potential allegations of a \nmore personally motivated attack are inoculated against.  In our wider sample, it was \nsimilarly oriented to as a signifier of tolerance.  \nElsewhere, those few extracts which adopted a pro-faith schooling line \ncontrastingly attempted to inoculate against charges of segregationism and construct \nfaith schools as facilitators of \u2018community cohesion\u2019 (as we will see in the next \nsection). In summary, this struggle for the right to make integrative claims seems to \nreflect not only the manner in which integration was morally optimalized within our \nsample but also the extent of the rhetorical cachet it was taken to carry. \n \nIntegrating space \nWhile the previous section points to the ambiguity embedded in banal constructions \nof integration, our wider sample evidenced variability in this domain. That is, \nattempts were seen elsewhere to elaborate on the meaning of integration. Particularly, \nintegration and the acculturative moral order were often structured and elaborated in \nsocio-spatial terms. Blommaert and Verhschueren (1998) themselves point to the \nspatial connotations of integration, examining its etymological roots and suggesting \nthat it represents something of a boundary concept, referring to the process of \n                                                 \n3 Polly Toynbee is a regular columnist for The Guardian. This quotation represents a response to an \narticle in which she called for faith schools to be abolished. Extract 2 is taken from the Toynbee article, \n\u2018Get off your knees\u2019 (The Guardian, 11\/6\/04).  \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 19\nmovement from outsider to insider in a manner which implicitly locates its subjects\u2019 \ncurrent position as \u2018other\u2019. While the next section attends to the insider\/outsider \nimplications of integration, this section lays the foundations for this by focusing on \nthe socio-spatial maintenance of the acculturative moral order. This might best be \nexemplified through close examination of extract 4.  \nExtract 4: The Guardian (10\/06\/04) \u2013 Commentary by Madeleine Bunting \n \u2026In this Hackney school, there are 40 different nationalities, over 20 different \nlanguages \u2013 and one faith. Nigeria, the Philippines, Colombia, Eritrea, Vietnam, \nPortugal, Italy, Ireland: what goes on in this Catholic primary school is an \nextraordinary process of integration that makes the public debate about the \ndivisiveness of faith schools appear absurd. This is a model of social cohesion and it \nis a faith school.  \nSimilarly, in Muslim schools I have visited I have seen the same sort of astonishing \nglobal connections forged in the classroom between Afghans and Turks, Indonesians \nand Nigerians, Pakistanis and Ugandans. It's not that this kind of integration doesn't \ngo on in good secular state schools. It's just that faith schools have a particular \nstrength here - call it a head start if you like. \nHere are two faiths, Islam and Catholicism, which both have a huge heritage of \ntravelling across race, culture, tribe and nations to build common transnational \nidentities. Both hold strongly to a powerful belief of the equality of all believers, and \na sense of belonging as co-religionists. These two faiths were the first \ninternationalists. It is their ethical frameworks that have inspired subsequent secular \nglobal humanism. \nWhere else in an inner city do you get Irish, Nigerian, Italian and English talking to \neach other in the same public building, but a Catholic church?...churches and \nmosques are often the only means left of bringing together people of different race \nand economic background.  \n(The Guardian, June 10th, 2004) \nThe relatively few pro-faith schooling arguments in our sample reified constructions \nof the integrative potential of faith schools by drawing on place-identity formulations \nin which the school provided a \u2018place-as-container\u2019 organizing metaphor as grounding \nfor the construction of \u201csocial cohesion\u201d. In extract 4, the word \u201cIn\u201d (\u201cIn this Hackney \nschool\u2026\u201d) invokes a sense of the school as a physically bounded area by way of the \nimplicit distinction it makes between potential positionings within and without.  \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 20\nThe discursive location of multiple nationalities within a socially constructed \n\u2018physical area\u2019 works up a sense of co-presence in a manner which implicitly \nexplicates \u201cthe extraordinary process of integration\u201d in terms of the sense of shared \nphysical proximity that this creates. Moreover, the enormity of this integrative \nachievement is emphasized through the juxtaposition of the faith\u2019s school\u2019s socio-\nspatial singularity with a quantitatively-formulated sense of diversity (\u201c40 different \nnationalities, over 20 different languages\u201d).  \nThis, of course, resonates with the kinds of spatial metaphors (for \nexample,\u2018nation-as-container\u2019) identified in anti-immigration arguments in the right-\nwing press (Charteris-Black, 2006). Here, it similarly serves to enhance the \nintelligibility of an otherwise complex argument by grounding it in the accessibility of \nsimplified everyday language. However, where anti-immigration arguments typically \ndraw on spatial metaphors to legitimize tighter boundary controls (keeping \u2018them\u2019 \nout), here the container metaphor is used to render a sense of togetherness. In extract \n4, the assumed physical proximity of faith space is oriented to as permitting an \ninteractional scene which informs the wider construction of integration (\u201cWhere else \nin an inner city do you get Irish, Nigerian, Italian and English talking to each other in \nthe same public building, but a Catholic church?\u201d).  \nHowever, it is important to recognize that this spatial rendering is not detached \nfrom the social. \u201cFaith schools\u201d, \u201cCatholic churches\u201d and \u201cMuslim schools\u201d represent \nplace-identity formulations of the kind identified by Dixon and Durrheim (2000), that \nis, rhetorically-driven, naturalized associations between place and identity \nconstructions. Moreover, the movement of the passage from one spatio-temporal \ncontext to another (that is, from \u201cfaith schools\u201d in the first paragraph to \u201cMuslim \nschools\u201d in the second paragraph and then the \u201cCatholic church\u201d in the third) assumes \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 21\ncontinuity and mutual relevance. It assumes a generalizability from the positive \nconnotations embedded in the integrationary construction of \u201cchurches and mosques\u201d \nto \u201cfaith schools\u201d more generally (and vice versa). This relies on the conjoining of \nIslamic and Catholic place-identities through associations with the common category \nconstruction of \u2018faith\u2019 (\u201cHere are two faiths...\u201d). This assumed superordinate \ncommonality alongside the metonymic elision of place and identity \u2013 an elision which \nestablishes equivalence between the geographic and the social (Wallwork & Dixon, \n2004) \u2013 permits \u201cchurches and mosques\u201d to stand not only for \u201cfaith schools\u201d but also \nfaith more generally, forming a process of mutual constitution. \u2018Faith\u2019, symbolized by \nthe \u201cchurches and mosques\u201d, is positioned as the agentic force which permits and \nencourages integration to occur (\u201cbringing together people of different race and \neconomic background\u201d). Locating groups within faith space brings groups together \nalong this dimension, such that previously discussed spatial components are \ninextricably interwoven with faith in the construction of integration and, in doing so, \npositive claims of integration are extended to a socio-geography of faith in general. \nMoreover, the spatial connotations of the \u201cfaith school\u201d, \u201cthe Muslim school\u201d and \n\u201cthe Catholic church\u201d serve to concretize the integrative construction of faith by \ngrounding it in a construction of out-there material reality.  \nOrienting to the rhetorical power carried by located constructions of \nintegration, anti-faith schooling arguments contested such constructions in ways \nwhich contrastingly drew on constructions of socio-spatial division. \nExtract 5: The Daily Telegraph (10\/06\/04) - News Report \nAndrew Bennett, the Labour MP and chairman of the Commons select committee \nwhich inquired into social cohesion last year, said Northern Ireland demonstrated the \ndangers of faith-based schools. (The Daily Telegraph, June 10th, 2004) \nExtract 6: Daily Mirror (10\/06\/04) \u2013 News Report \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 22\nBut most MPs believe more religious schools would fuel racial divisions.  \nAndrew Bennett, chairman of a Commons committee which investigated the 2002 \nrace riots, said: \u201cWhat we want is for children to have a good understanding of each \nother\u2019s culture.  \n\u201cSeparating them in schools is not going to be a good idea.\u201d \nExtract 5 orients to this task by drawing on \u201cNorthern Ireland\u201d as a totemic \ninstantiation of the transgressive \u201cdangers\u201d of faith schools. Its demonstrative power \nimplicates socio-historical connotations which go beyond the purely spatial, its \nambiguity eliding social and spatial meanings in a manner which, by extension, \n\u2018materially\u2019 grounds the more abstract connotations of the former. It thereby renders a \nsense of social cohesion-threatening socio-spatial division as justification for the \nimplicit condemnation of faith schools. It is oriented to \u2013 through a lack of \nqualification or explanation \u2013 as having assumed cultural resonances which permit it \nto be used as a symbolic short-hand for the dangers of social division. Moreover, it \nserves by way of a comparative formulation (\u201c\u2026Northern Ireland demonstrated the \ndangers of faith-based schools\u201d) to present the problems posed by faith schools within \na wider national framework, thus positioning faith schools as potential facilitators of \nsocial division outside their own local context. \n  Extract 6 represents a more explicitly spatialized formulation of the \u2018same\u2019 \nspeakers\u2019 account. It again orients to a place-as-container construction of (faith) \nschools in which children might be located but which is taken to entail inevitable \n\u2018separation\u2019. It is unclear whether the act of \u201cseparating\u201d refers to in-school \nsegregation or sets up schools as spatial units providing the boundaries of a wider \napartheid \u2013 an ambiguity which conjoins both meanings and therefore inextricably \nlinks local and macro levels of a socio-spatial transgression of integrationist values \n(\u201cgood understanding of each other\u2019s culture\u201d). To summarize, these examples \ndemonstrate the ways in which the struggle to represent faith schools as \u2018integrative\u2019 \nis frequently a socio-spatial one, with a varying implementation of place rhetoric \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 23\nproviding a means by which constructions of social cohesion or division might be \ngrounded in a sense of material reality, whilst at the same time guiding the \nconstruction of this reality.  \n \nAssimilationism and discourses of tolerance \nFinally, attempts made by articles to align themselves with the liberal norms of the \nacculturative moral hierarchy, could frequently be seen to gloss over an underlying \ndrive towards assimilationism. Integration was often used synonymously with a \nprivileging of assimilative outcomes, while \u2018assimilation\u2019 itself was never directly \noriented to. Typically, this was predicated on an implicit rendering of insider and \noutsider status. Throughout our sample, the boundary connotations of \u2018integration\u2019 \nsuggested by Blommaert and Verschueren (1998) were reinforced by normative \nconstructions of the mainstream British ingroup, which served simultaneously to \nexclude Muslims from insider status. A re-consideration of Extract 2 exemplifies this \nbanal exclusion. In \u2018expecting\u2019 Muslims to integrate, they are positioned as current \n\u2018outsiders\u2019 to the assumed ingroup. This does not simply locate responsibility for \n\u2018integration\u2019 with Muslims (it is positioned as a state that they must seek to fulfil). \nRather, the invocation of what is positioned as a self-evidently legitimate \n\u2018expectation\u2019 serves implicitly to position Muslims as subjects of simultaneously \nprivileged mainstream requirements.  \nThese assimilative undertones were also more explicitly reproduced.  \nConsider extracts 7 and 8: \nExtract 7: The Daily Telegraph (06\/06\/04) - Letters \n\u2026There was a room set aside for prayers but I never saw anyone using it. Perhaps \nthis was why it all had to change. What a shame\u2026 \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 24\n...We even had a Christian Jordanian Arab boy in the school, totally integrated with \nthe others and highly popular. Academically these young men, lively but manageable, \nwere ahead of their contemporaries in state schools, especially in mathematics. The \nmodest princes mixed easily with everyone else and sang Amazing Grace in the \nmusic room as enthusiastically as the rest\u2026 \nAlan F Orr \nOckbrook, Derbyshire \nExtract 8: The Daily Mail (10\/06\/04) \u2013 Commentary by Manzoor Moghal \nChairman of the Federation of Muslim Organisations \nThe report\u2019s authors also demand substantial changes in the culture, teaching methods \nand even the curriculum of mainstream state schools in order to accommodate the \nspecial needs \u2013 real and imaginary \u2013 of Muslim pupils\u2026 \n...But most of these problems are easy to solve. For example, it is not difficult to \nprovide halal meat or to give enough time and space for those who wish to pray. \nIndeed, compromises are constantly being worked out by individual schools every \nday with parent-teacher associations and local mosques\u2026  \n\u2026As an East African Asian who fled Idi Amin\u2019s murderous regime in Uganda to this \ncountry, I know real prejudice. In my experience, this is one of the most tolerant \ncountries in the world, and the constant niggling criticism by those who should know \nbetter is both unfair and counter-productive\u2026 \n\u2026Those groups who want separate Islamic education should not expect to be granted \nfunding purely on the basis that they are Muslims. \nInstead they should concentrate on producing funding applications with more \nconvincing arguments\u2026 \n \nThough extract 7 notably draws on the notion of being \u201ctotally integrated\u201d as part of \nits romanticization of the school\u2019s past, it is a state oriented to as entailing a \nminimization of difference and assimilation into the mainstream culture. It is this \nminimization of non-mainstream cultural expression \u2013 signified by the lack of prayer \nroom usage (\u201cI never saw anyone use it\u201d) and the lack of protest with which \n\u201cAmazing Grace\u201d is sung \u2013 that is taken to demonstrate that integration had been \nachieved. Integration, in effect, is being used synonymously with assimilation, \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 25\nentailing in its micro-level configuration an assumed conformity to mainstream values \nand modes of identity expression.  \nFrequently, this was legitimized by contrastive constructions of ingroup \ntolerance and Muslim transgression. In extract 8, for example, we see evidence of \nattempts to position \u201cthis country\u201d favourably within a discourse of tolerance. Its \nanthropomorphic construction as \u201cone of the most tolerant countries in the world\u201d \n(relatively) emphasizes a willingness to indulge other cultures in a socio-spatially \nfixed manner which lends this \u2018tolerance\u2019 a dispositional status. While mainstream \ntolerance is maximized through a constructed willingness to \u201caccommodate\u2026special \nneeds\u201d and make \u201ccompromises\u201d, Muslims are positioned as exploitative \ntransgressors of reasonableness in the sense that they make \u201cdemands\u201d in spite of \nmainstream concessions and, moreover, \u201cexpect\u201d such concessions to be made (\u201con \nthe basis that they are Muslims\u201d). Positive self-presentation is thereby coupled with \nnegative other-description. This occurs in a manner which implicitly places blame for \nthe faith schooling situation on unreasonable Muslims whilst avoiding charges of \nprejudice through an appeal to liberal norms \u2013 a rhetorical pattern which resonates \nwith that delineated by Van Dijk\u2019s (1991) analysis of racist discourse in the press. \nMoreover, the tolerance discourse carries with it an agent-patient structure which \nreproduces power-relations between tolerator and tolerated. \u201cThis country\u201d is \nempowered with the ability to tolerate. Muslims are contrastingly positioned as an \noutside force that must be indulged in a manner which, in tandem with their \ntransgressiveness, justifies an implicit diminishing of rights. Their outsider status and \ntransgressiveness combine to legitimize the assertion of assimilative ideological \ndemands made by the tolerant mainstream. The line \u201cthey should concentrate on \nproducing funding applications with more convincing arguments\u201d necessitates that for \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 26\nMuslims to act in a morally acceptable way, they must adhere to mainstream routes to \npolitical and social action, alternatives having been constructed as unmeritocratic. \nSuch arguments uphold a monistic vision of morality centring around liberal notions \nof meritocracy and equality in a manner which glosses over potential inequalities \nembedded in existing power structures and, in condemning alternative action, \nconsequently serves to legitimize the maintenance of the status quo.   \nA brief digression is called for at this point. Extract 8 demonstrates that \nintegrationism was not only associated with \u2018non-Muslim\u2019 voices but was also \nmobilized from implicitly Muslim speaking positions. For example, the positioning of \n\u201cManzoor Moghal\u201d as \u201cChairman of the Federation of Muslim Organisations\u201d \nconstructs an association which privileges readings taking the former to be a member \nof the Muslim community and moreover indexes a role which confers the entitlement \nto speak for members of this community (\u201cChairman\u2026\u201d). Category entitlements are \nfurther worked up in the body of the extract (\u201cAs an East African Asian\u2026\u201d) in ways \nwhich establish experiential credentials that locally legitimize the dismissal of Muslim \nfaith schooling demands and, in conjunction with the adoption of authorial \ninsiderness, inoculate against potential charges of Islamophobia.  \nExtract 9: The Mail on Sunday (13\/10\/04) \u2013 Commentary by Peter Hitchens \nMuslims must learn language of tolerance. \nIf we are to have more Muslim schools then they must teach in the English language \nso that we can all know for certain that their pupils are not being poisoned against \nChristianity and our free way of life. \nWe must not be afraid of accusations of \u2018Islamophobia\u2019 when we address this issue. I \nknow of nowhere where Islam in power is even half as tolerant of Christianity as we \nare of Islam. \n(The Mail on Sunday, June 13th, 2004 \n \nReturning to our central concern, the relationship between discourses of \ntolerance and assimilation is crystallized in extract 9. Mainstream (Christian) \n\u2018tolerance\u2019 of Islam is set up in direct contrast to Islamic \u2018tolerance\u2019 of the assumed \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 27\nmainstream faith of Christianity (\u201cI know of nowhere where Islam in power is even \nhalf as tolerant of Christianity as we are of Islam\u201d). Positioning relative to the taken-\nfor-granted moral order of tolerance consequently serves to justify the assimilative \ncall for Muslim schools to teach in the English language on the basis that this will \nperform a civilizing function, protecting against the assumed tendency of Muslim \nschools to \u2018poison\u2019 pupils \u201cagainst Christianity and our free way of life\u201d. It is a call \nwhich supposes an existing mutual exclusivity of Islam and Christianity-centred \nEnglishness along linguistic dimensions and moreover, reproduces a form of \nhegemonic paternalism permitted by the hierarchical structuring of morality \nembedded in the tolerance discourse. \nIn spite of consistent attempts to uphold integration as \u2018the moral good\u2019, what \nwe see in practice is the reproduction of a hierarchical insider\/outsider structure which \nprescribes conformity and, in doing so, frequently diminishes the acculturation \nresponsibilities of the non-Muslim mainstream. While non-Muslim cultural systems \nare privileged, the rights of Muslims to assert their own cultural identities are \nimplicitly marginalized. In our wider sample, this marginalization was frequently \nlegitimized by a variety of transgressive constructions of Islam. In summary, \nintegration may work to maintain positions of tolerance and an acceptance of \ndiversity, but frequently this conceals a drive towards a hegemonically-driven cultural \nhomogeneity.   \nDiscussion \nThis paper has attempted to demonstrate the benefits of adopting a discourse analytic \napproach to the study of acculturation. It has been argued that a discursive approach \nprovides a useful point of departure by way of which problems associated with \ntypologically-situated acculturation research might best be addressed. While previous \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 28\nresearch has privileged \u2018integration\u2019 as a relatively stable acculturation \u2018attitude\u2019 or \n\u2018stance\u2019 held by the individual, the present study provides evidence of how this this \nmoral privileging is achieved in rhetorically-directed discursive practice. \nAcculturative moral hierarchies were consistently oriented to in which integration was \npositioned as the optimal response to diversity while segregationism and social \ndivision were positioned as transgressive. These were drawn upon as a rhetorical basis \nfrom which to legitimize (albeit in a small subsection of the data corpus where pro-\nfaith schooling stances were taken up) or condemn faith schooling. Their re-\nproduction was implicit in the banal commonplaces of everyday language. Orienting \nto integration as an assumed optimal state without qualification imbued it with the \nself-evident moral weight of \u2018common sense\u2019 thereby serving to close down possible \navenues of contestation. It is in its taken-for-granted alignment with the moral good \nthat integration takes on the rhetorical characteristics of resources such as meritocracy \nand equality (as delineated by authors such as Augoustinos, Tuffin, and Every, 2005, \nRiley, 2002, and Wetherell and Potter, 1992), consequently finding itself to be \nimplicitly positioned within a wider liberal interpretative framework. \nFurthermore, the rhetoric of integration evidenced in the print media was \nshown to encompass ideological dilemmas embedded in wider liberal discourses of \ntolerance, as demonstrated elsewhere in both British and non-British political rhetoric \n(Blommaert, 1997; Blommaert & Verhschueren, 1998; Lewis & Neal, 2005; Yuval-\nDavis, Anthias & Kofman, 2005). While integrationism might be explicitly mobilized \nto garner a liberal footing, it frequently concealed assimilative undertones and a drive \ntowards homogeneity in line with normatively positioned \u2018mainstream\u2019 (that is, non-\nMuslim) British values. Hopkins and Kahani-Hopkins (2006) have recently stressed \nthe importance of analysing the ways in which both minorities and majorities make \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 29\nsense of intergroup relations and group positioning in order to better understand the \nways in which particular approaches to intercultural contact are sustained. It is \ntherefore important to recognize this mainstream media assimilationism in practice. It \nconflicts with the conceptualization offered by traditional acculturation models which \ntake integration to minimally involve an acceptance of multiple cultures. The \nassimilative-integration discourse evidenced in this study contrastingly assumes the \nkind of pre-existing moral and cultural structure to society which, as Parekh (2000) \nsuggests, is equated with a dominant in-group. The use of normative constructs to \ndemand assimilation as the basis for allocating social and political rights clearly \nreproduces power structures in which the rights of \u2018other\u2019 cultures are necessarily \ndiminished in order for assimilation to be achieved (assimilation requiring a \nrelinquishing of cultural and moral values which are \u2018other\u2019 to those of the \nmainstream). Its drive towards homogeneity is inherently at odds with notions of \ncultural diversity predicated on a sense of shared intercultural development. It \ncontains traces of cultural imperialism and an underlying intolerance of cultural \ndiversity which risks, albeit in the name of integration, encouraging the persistence of \nconflict. Moreover, the implicit (and sometimes explicit) marginalization of Islam \n(that is, closing down Muslim speaking positions) may provide a resource by way of \nwhich intergroup relations are understood from minority perspectives, in ways which \nmight potentially legitimize separatism or else preclude the possibility of intercultural \nand interfaith dialogue (see Hopkins and Kahani-Hopkins, 2006).  \nIn tandem with the interplay of \u2018integration\u2019 and \u2018segregation\u2019 in establishing \nacculturative moral orders (which itself was suggestive of the mutually constitutive \nnature of these constructs), our findings point to an interrelationship of acculturation \nconstructs as they are caught up (and themselves constructed) in the accomplishment \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 30\nof occasioned argumentative goals. While we acknowledge the need for further \nstudies to examine the nature of this interrelationship in more detail, the present study \nnevertheless begins to demonstrate the limitations of the typological discourse in \nwhich traditional research locates itself. The discursive focus on contextualized \nconstitution problematizes the inscription of pre-defined meanings of acculturation \nconstructs on data which may risk reifying hegemonic forms of sense-making. It \nprovides a lens through which the hegemonic structure of acculturation discourses \nmight be understood and consequently opened to critique. From this perspective, the \nprivileging of integration in traditional research becomes troubled rather than reified \nas a taken-for-granted positive outcome that we should seek to facilitate. The shift \naway from the typological discourse to an exploration of collectively shared forms of \nsense-making consequently avoids locating responsibility for particular forms of \nmulticultural relations with the individual in a manner which absolves wider socio-\npolitical structures. \nOur findings demonstrate the limitations of typological acculturation research \nand are intended to carve openings for a discursive approach to acculturation. There \nare, however, a number of points that should be raised regarding the specific context \nof this study. Firstly, while acculturative constructs such as marginalization and \nassimilation were not directly invoked in relation to the faith schooling debate, \nalternative contexts might see argumentation negotiated in terms of alternative \nresources. Moreover, the relative lack of variability identified in the deployment of \nintegrationist discourse drawn upon in relation to the faith schooling arguments \ndiscussed here may be a by-product of constraints associated with the mainstream \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 31\nmedia at the time of sampling4. Nevertheless, in a preliminary way, our analysis \nmakes clear the importance of an attention to that which remains inexplicit and to \nwhich a typological approach based on restrictive questionnaire methodology appears \ninsensitive.  \nSecondly, while the critique provided in the introduction draws attention to the \nfailure of traditional research to account for the ways in which acculturation is \nactually negotiated within and between groups, the present study similarly fails to \naddress the latter issue. Our media study provides a sampling of culturally available \nacculturative repertoires. However, the hegemonic structures of the British media  \nmay frequently marginalize or exclude the voice of particular cultural \u2018others\u2019. As \nsuch, our newspaper sample may have potentially precluded the kind of resistances \nthat might occur in more inclusive interactional settings (or, indeed, in other sections \nof the media where a diversity of non-secular \u2013 particularly Muslim \u2013 voices may be \nmore widely represented). Verkuyten (2003), for example, has recently drawn \nattention to the ways in which \u2018assimilation\u2019 may be resisted through discourses of \ncultural essentialism which render it an impossibility and by conceptualizing cultural \nadaptation as a possibility which does not necessarily entail assimilation. Indeed, the \npossibility might also be entertained that, since assimilationism prescribes a \nrelinquishing of cultural values, it entails an explicit friction with liberal discourses of \ncultural diversity predicated on an assumed drive towards tolerance. The \nencroachment of liberal tolerance \u2018norms\u2019 might permit or even encourage particular \nforms of resistance which threaten the persuasiveness of assimilation-based \narguments. This seems to be a potential explanation for the synonymous usage of \n                                                 \n4 More recently, media debate regarding the rights of Muslim women to wear the niqab has, in more \nliberal sections of the British press, begun to orient to the failures of white non-Muslims to \u2018integrate\u2019 \ninto multicultural society (for example, \u2018Let\u2019s have an open and honest discussion about White people\u2019,  \nThe Guardian, 02\/10\/06) \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 32\nintegration in our sample. However, further research is required which not only gives \nvoice to \u2018others\u2019 but also examines the contestation of acculturative outcomes in \neveryday discursive practice, a pursuit which favours an approach focusing on the \nmilieu of everyday conversational interactions.  \nThirdly, our concentration on the faith schooling issue has provided a useful \ncontextual lens through which to examine acculturative discourses. However, it is \nacknowledged that this focus provided something of a restricted sample on the basis \nthat it was rarely engaged with by a particular section of our newspaper sample \n(namely The Sun and The Daily Mirror). While this represents something of a \nlimitation, our wider research project has nevertheless evidenced similar discursive \npatterns in relation to a range of issues across diverse sub-sections of the British print \nmedia. Nonetheless, the present study seems to support the identification of schools as \na key site of power struggles to determine \u2018belongingness\u2019. Recent research has \nexamined the socio-spatial practices through which faith schools are materially drawn \nupon and challenged in the maintenance and contestation of particular identities \n(Valins, 2003). In line with the present findings, this research has acknowledged the \nfluidity of socio-spatial boundaries and their openness to justification or contestation \nalong lines of inclusivity and segregation respectively. Our discourse analytic \nperspective has suggested that the rhetoric employed in the struggle over faith schools \nmay be involved in the re-production of the more macro-level power structures \nunderpinning acculturation. More research is required which takes faith schooling as a \nsubstantive concern and sets out to delineate its rhetorical role in the negotiation of \ncultural diversity. \nTo conclude, it is important to address a key research finding as yet \nconspicuous by its absence in this discussion. This study drew attention to a number \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 33\nof issues on which the negotiation of acculturation discourse was seemingly \ndependent. Particularly, our analysis drew attention to the sense in which the \nnegotiation of acculturative moral orders was frequently a discursively located one. \nThat is, it was frequently dependent on socio-spatial constructions of integration and \nsegregation, constructs which were simultaneously shown to carry banal boundary \nconnotations implicated in the upkeep of insider\/outsider distinctions. By locating the \nintegrative or divisive potential of faith schools in geographically-grounded \nconstructions of the material environment, these acculturative consequences were lent \na sense of out-there-ness, oriented to as carrying the rhetorical weight of \u2018reality\u2019. \nThese preliminary findings point to the potential that discursive re-conceptualizations \nof place (Dixon & Durrheim, 2000; Wallwork & Dixon, 2004) hold for developing a \n\u2018grounded\u2019 understanding of acculturation. Indeed, acculturative questions of \nintergroup contact and participation might be thought to encode a spatial dimension \n(see Dixon, 2001, for a spatialized discursive re-working of intergroup contact). \nQuestions might be raised not only about how place resources sustain particular \nacculturation discourses but also about how acculturative constructs sustain particular \ndiscursive mappings of place and what role this relationship might play in the         \n(re-)production of intercultural relations. Our earlier call for research into the \nnegotiation of acculturation in everyday discursive practice should therefore be \nextended to include a spatial dimension. Particularly, what is needed is a discursive \napproach which not only considers the role of place at a linguistic rhetorical level but \nalso begins to consider the ways in which the discursive-material environment is \nimplicated in the everyday accomplishment of acculturation.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n   Acculturation Rhetoric 34\nMany thanks to John Dixon, Mick Finlay and two anonymous reviewers for helpful \ncomments on previous versions of this paper.\n   Acculturation Rhetoric 35\nReferences \nArends-Toth, J., & van de Vijver, F.
