However, about half of this,\ni.e. 6000\u20139000 TW h\/year, is considered to be un-\neconomic to exploit at present [1]. A major factor is that\nmuch of this energy is available only at low heads.\nAlthough water turbines are available to convert the\npower from low-head water into electricity or other\nforms, the high capital cost of the installation per unit\noutput often makes such plant uneconomic.\nAttention has been drawn to the advantages of con-\nverting the energy of water into air pressure energy, in the\ncontext of sea waves [2]; at a given pressure drop, the\ncharacteristic velocity of the \u008f uid is inversely propor-\ntional to the square root of the density; therefore for air it\nis about 29 times that for water. Conversion of a water\nhead into air pressure allows the use of much smaller and\ncheaper machines, which do not have to be buried in large\nstructures below water level.\nProposals for interchanging pressure between water\nand air have been put forward based upon alternating\nA00700 \u00d3 IMechE 2001 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A\n223\nThe MS was received on 25 February 2000 and was accepted after\nrevision for publication on 29 September 2000.\n*Corresponding author: Engineering Department, Faculty of Applied\nSciences, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YR, UK.\ndisplacement mechanisms [3, 4] but these suffer from the\ndisadvantages of large size and cyclic operation. A steady\n\u008f ow system, proposed in connection with the proposals\nfor a tidal barrage hydropower system for the Severn\nEstuary, was based on a known and proven invention, the\nhydraulic compressor, used a century ago in North\nAmerica to provide compressed air for mining operations\nand still in use in some places [5\u20138]. In this type of\ncompressor, a stream \u008f owing through an inverted siphon\nentrains air in the downward leg, which is released in a\nstilling chamber or sump at the bottom at a pressure of a\nfew atmospheres. The deaerated stream then rises\nthrough the upward leg of the siphon and resumes its\noriginal course to the sea.\nRecently, the hydraulic compressor has been proposed\nfor use as a compressor in a gas turbine cycle [9, 10].\nBecause the water has much greater heat capacity than\nthe air and the two \u008f uids are in intimate contact, the\ncompression is very nearly isothermal and so requires\nless work than a conventional compressor, which is\nalmost adiabatic.\nAt low-head sites, such as the many weirs already in\nexistence on rivers, it would be costly to excavate the\ndeep stilling chambers that are an essential part of a\nhydraulic compressor system. The siphon system which\nis examined in this paper is constructed entirely above\nground and is relatively inexpensive.\nA siphon converter from water to air pressure was built\nin the early 1990s at Borrowash on the River Derwent,\nUK. The device differed signi\u008e cantly from that described\nhere, and its performance was disappointing. Only a brief\nanalysis has been published [11].\nThe models developed by Rice [7], Berghmans and\nAhrens [8] and Bidini et al. [10] include almost every loss\nand pressure change that occurs, however small. In this\npaper a different approach is taken; in order to keep the\nanalysis simple, some terms are lumped together and very\nsmall terms are omitted, with negligible effect on the\nresults.\n2 BASIS OF THE SYSTEM\nThe siphon system which is the subject of this paper can\nbe thought of as an inversion of the hydraulic compressor.\nA siphon is used to connect the upper and lower reaches\nof a river, the difference in levels being the available head\nH (Fig. 1). An aerator A, \u008e tted near the top of the\nFig. 1 Schematic diagram of the siphon system\nProc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A A00700 \u00d3 IMechE 2001\n224 M J FRENCH AND M B WIDDEN\ndownward leg of the siphon, is connected to a valve V\nwhich opens to the atmosphere.\nWith valve V closed, the water will \u008f ow through the\nsiphon from the upper to the lower reach at a velocity\nsuch that the loss of head at the inlet, in friction and at the\nexit is equal to the head H. The pressure in the top of the\nsiphon will be substantially below atmospheric. If valve\nV is opened slightly, air will be drawn in through the\naerator and entrained in the water as small bubbles which\nare carried downwards to the lower reach. The mean\ndensity in the downward leg is reduced by the presence of\nthe bubbles; consequently the driving head, and the\nvelocity of the water, will be reduced. The term\n\u2018buoyancy head\u2019 B has been used in this paper to denote\nthe reduction in head due to the buoyancy of the bubbles.\nIf the amount of air admitted is gradually increased, the\nwater velocity will fall and the siphon will eventually\nbreak. However, at a lower \u008f owrate of air the siphon will\nrun steadily, drawing in air at a pressure slightly above\nthat in the siphon (the process of aeration itself involves a\nslight loss of head). The siphon works as an air pump,\ndrawing air through the valve. If the valve is replaced\nwith an air turbine, power can be generated. (In practice,\nthe air \u008f ow to a number of siphons is likely to be used to\npower a single turbine.)\nA slip loss arises from the upward drift of the bubbles\nthrough the water. The relative velocity at which a bubble\nrises depends on its size, on the concentration of the\nbubbles and on the effects of containing walls. The rate of\nrise in uncon\u008e ned water of a single bubble of diameter\nbetween 2 and 20 mm is less than 0.3 m\/s; for clouds of\nbubbles in\u008f uenced by containing walls, the velocity is\nlikely to be reduced [12, 13]. Experiments by Rice [7]\nshowed that the velocity with which a cloud of bubbles in\na vertical duct rises relative to water is approximately\n0.24 m\/s. The slip s exactly parallels slip in propellers and\ninduction motors and introduces a fractional loss of\nef\u008e ciency in the same way, but, as in propellers and\ninduction motors, there is no work transfer and hence no\npower without slip.\nThe void fraction a (the fraction of the total volume\nthat can be occupied by air) is subject to a limit if the \u008f ow\nis to remain in the bubbly regime, i.e. a suspension of\nmany discrete bubbles in a continuous liquid. Wallis [12]\nquoted experiments which show that for values of the\nvoid fraction greater than a \u02c6 0.3 the character of the\n\u008f ow changes from bubbly \u008f ow to a new pattern con-\ntaining very large bubbles which almost \u008e ll the duct and\nwill break the siphon.\nCalculations based on these values, as set out below,\nsuggest that the conversion of water to air pressure\nenergy can be achieved at 70 per cent ef\u008e ciency or better.\n(There is an additional loss because the expansion in the\nturbine is not isothermal.) If energy cost is the main\ncriterion rather than ef\u008e ciency in a thermodynamic sense,\nit may be decided to move away from the optimum\nef\u008e ciency point towards a greater power output.\n3 ANALYSIS\nIn this straightforward treatment it is assumed that the\ncompression of the air is isothermal as it descends from A\nto C (Fig. 1) (see, for example, references [8] and [12]). It\nis also assumed that the cross-section of the siphon is so\nshaped that the water \u008f ow velocity v is constant\nthroughout the whole length. This assumption is made\nbecause sharp variations in v must involve losses;\nconstant v is likely to be close to the practical optimum.\nFurthermore, while including every small variation\nmakes little difference to the results, it requires numerical\nintegration and makes the analysis less insightful.\n3.1 Pumping section (AC in Fig. 1)\nThe friction loss in this straight section is small compared\nwith the gravity term and can be lumped in with the losses\nupstream and downstream of the pumping section, as is\ndone here (Section 3.2). Consider a horizontal element dy\nof the descending \u008f ow, y being the height above C (see\nFig. 1). Let the ratio of the volume of air in it to the\nvolume of water be x. The density of air is only about\n0.12 per cent of the density of water at normal ambient\npressures and will be still less at the reduced pressure in\nthe siphon. Thus the mean density re of the element is\ngiven, with error less than 0.12 per cent, by\nre \u02c6\nr\n1\u2021 x \u20261\u2020\nSince there is no acceleration, the pressure change over\nheight dy is given by\ndp \u02c6 \u00a1reg dy \u20262\u2020\nIf the drift velocity of the bubbles, sv, is constant between\npoints A and C, then x, the volumetric ratio of air to\nwater, will vary with the absolute pressure according to\nx \u02c6 xCpC\np\n\u20263\u2020\nbecause the air is being compressed isothermally.\n(In fact, the drift velocity varies a little with bubble\ndiameter and will change as the bubbles descend and the\npressure increases. However, sv is nearly constant for\nbubble diameters between 1 mm and 4 mm [12], which is\nthe likely range of bubble sizes in the siphon. Since the\nvariation in sv is small, it is treated as constant over\nheight AC.)\nCombining equations (1) and (2),\ndp \u02c6 \u00a1 1\n1 \u2021 x rg dy \u20264\u2020\nSubstituting for x from equation (3) and integrating\nA00700 \u00d3 IMechE 2001 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A\nTHE EXPLOITATION OF LOW-HEAD HYDROPOWER BY PRESSURE INTERCHANGEWITH AIR 225\nbetween points A and C,\u2026pC\npA\n1 \u2021 xCpC\np\n\u00b3 \u00b4\ndp \u02c6 \u00a1\n\u20260\nyA\nrg dy \u20265\u2020\nwhich gives\n\u2026pC \u00a1 pA\u2020 \u2021 xCpC ln pCpA\n\u00b3 \u00b4\n\u02c6 rgyA \u20266\u2020\nReplacing xC in equation (6) by xApA\/pC,\nrgyA \u02c6 \u2026pC \u00a1 pA\u2020 \u2021 xApC pA\npC\nln\npC\npA\n\u00b3 \u00b4\n\u20267\u2020\nWriting r\u02c6 pC\/pA, the pressure ratio from A to C,\nrgyA \u02c6 \u2026pC \u00a1 pA\u2020 \u2021 xApC 1r ln r \u20268\u2020\nEquations (7) and (8) give the relation between yA and\npA. The \u008e rst term on the right gives the well-known result\nfor no aeration, while the second gives the effect of the\nair. The form of equation (8) is convenient because the\nvalue of xA is likely to be \u008e xed by the aerator and so\nknown, and the absolute pressure pC, being close to\natmospheric pressure, is approximately constant.\n3.2 Analysis of the whole siphon system, including\nlosses\nTo analyse the whole system, it suf\u008e ces to apply\nBernoulli\u2019s equation with loss terms to the \u008f ows up to\nA and from C onwards, which would be straightforward\nbut that the \u008f ow is aerated beyond C. Because the \u008f ow is\nturning at C and the buoyancy force will then cease to\noppose the \u008f ow, it is convenient to take the datum at the\nmid-depth of the downstream \u008f ow, distance d below the\ndownstream surface (although this means that pC is not\nexactly atmospheric pressure).\nIn the following, the symbols LA and LC have been\nused to represent the losses from entry to A and from C to\nexit respectively, measured in numbers of dynamic heads\nof water. As noted earlier, the relatively small friction\nloss in the pumping section AC can be lumped part into\nLA and part into LCwithout introducing signi\u008e cant error.\nThus, from the entry to A,\npA \u2021 12rv2 \u2021 rg\u2026yA \u00a1 H \u00a1 d\u2020 \u02c6 p0 \u00a1 LA 12rv2\n\u00a1 \u00a2 \u20269\u2020\nFrom C to the exit,\npC \u02c6 p0 \u2021 rgd \u00a1 12rv2 \u2021 LC 12rv2\n\u00a1 \u00a2 \u202610\u2020\nThe coef\u008e cient LC includes both the energy loss at the\nexit and the loss in the diffuser CD, together with any\nadditional loss that may arise in the diffuser from the fact\nthat the water is aerated.\nCombining equations (8) to (10) and expressing the\nresult in terms of head rather than pressure,\nH \u02c6 \u2026LA \u2021 LC\u2020 v\n2\n2g\n\u2021 B \u202611\u2020\nwhere B is the buoyancy head, given by\nB \u02c6 xA 1\nr\nln r\n\u00b3 \u00b4\npC\nrg\n\u202612\u2020\nEquation (11) shows clearly that the driving head H is\nequal to the total of the \u008f ow losses and the buoyancy\nhead. Increasing the aeration xA increases the buoyancy\nterm and so reduces v, giving the characteristic of the\nsiphon. Conversely, reducing the overall loss coef\u008e cient\ncauses v to increase.\n3.3 Ef\u008e ciency\nRegarding the siphon as an air pump, there are two\ncategories of loss. One, comprising the inlet and exit\nlosses plus the friction and bend losses, increases rapidly\nas the velocity of the water increases; this head loss is\nproportional to the square of the velocity of the water.\nThe other, the loss due to the upward drift of the bubbles,\nreduces as the water velocity increases.\nThe \u008e rst kind of loss appears in equation (11) as a head\nloss of (LA\u2021 LC) v2\/(2g). It is convenient to write this as\nKv2\/(2g), K being the overall loss coef\u008e cient. Since the\navailable head of water is H, this loss is a fraction\nKv2\/(2gH) of the energy available from the water. The\nremaining head H\u00a1 Kv2\/(2g) is balanced by, and so\nequal to, the buoyancy head B of the bubbles in the\ndownward leg of the siphon.\nThe power loss per unit cross-sectional area due to drift\nof the bubbles is the product of the buoyancy pressure and\nthe drift velocity, i.e. rg[H\u00a1 Kv2\/(2g)]sv. Thus the\nfractional loss due to slip is [1\u00a1 Kv2\/(2gH)]s, and the\nef\u008e ciency Z of the siphon as an air pump, i.e. the ratio of\nthe output energy in the pumped air to the available input\nenergy in the water, is given by\nZ \u02c6 1 \u00a1 Kv\n2\n2gH\n\u00a1 1\u00a1 Kv\n2\n2gH\n\u00b3 \u00b4\ns\n\u02c6 \u20261 \u00a1 s\u2020 1 \u00a1 Kv\n2\n2gH\n\u00b3 \u00b4\n\u202613\u2020\nIn this expression can be seen the contributions to the loss\nfrom drift of the bubbles (the term in the \u008e rst pair of\nparentheses), and from friction and exit loss (the second\npair of parentheses). It needs to be borne in mind that the\nProc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A A00700 \u00d3 IMechE 2001\n226 M J FRENCH AND M B WIDDEN\nslip ratio, s is not a constant but varies with the velocity of\nthe water.\n3.4 Optimum velocity of \u008f ow of the water\nIn a siphon of given geometry, the water \u008f ow velocity\ncan be adjusted to yield the highest ef\u008e ciency, or the\nhighest power, or some other condition. With the drift\nvelocity sv taken to be constant, it is readily shown by\ndifferentiating equation (13) with respect to v and setting\nthe result to zero that the ef\u008e ciency is maximum when\nv2\n1\ns\n\u00a1 12\n\u00b3 \u00b4\n\u02c6 gH\nK\n\u202614\u2020\nThis equation gives the water \u008f ow velocity for maximum\nef\u008e ciency as an air pump of a given siphon for which sv,\nK and H are known.\nIn practice, the maximum achievable power output\nmay be of greater interest than the maximum ef\u008e ciency.\nThe power output per unit area of pipe cross-section, P, is\ngiven by the product of the buoyant pressure of the air\nand the air \u008f ow velocity. Thus\nP \u02c6 rg H \u00a1 Kv\n2\n2g\n\u00b3 \u00b4\nv\u20261\u00a1 s\u2020 \u202615\u2020\nAgain by differentiating with respect to v, the condition\nfor maximum power output is found:\nv2\u20261:5 \u00a1 s\u2020 \u02c6 gH\nK\n\u202616\u2020\nFigure 2 shows curves for the water velocity v against\nthe ratio (gH\/K)1\/2. Curves are shown for two conditions:\nfor maximum ef\u008e ciency, and for maximum power per\nunit area of cross-section, of the siphon as an air pump.\nThe following calculation illustrates how these curves\ncan be used in choosing the operating conditions of a\ngiven siphon.\n3.4.1 Sample calculation\nConsider the case of a weir and siphon for which the\navailable water head H is 1.2 m, the overall loss\ncoef\u008e cient K is 0.7 and the drift speed of the bubbles,\nsv, is 0.25 m\/s. (With careful design of the \u008f ow passages\nand of the exit diffuser to minimize losses, it should be\npossible to achieve an overall loss coef\u008e cient of 0.7 or\nlower.)\nThe value of (gH\/K)1\/2 is 4.10 m\/s. From Fig. 2, it is\nfound that the maximum ef\u008e ciency of the siphon as\nan air pump is achieved when the water \u008f ow speed v is\n1.66 m\/s.\nThen s\u02c6 0.15; from equation (13), the ef\u008e ciency is\n0.78. The power output, given by ZrgHv, is 15.2 kW, and\nthe losses are 1.6 kW friction, inlet and exit loss and\n2.7 kW loss due to drift of the bubbles. All powers are\nexpressed per square metre of pipe cross-section.\nIf the maximum power output is sought, Fig. 2 shows\nthat the required water \u008f ow speed v is 3.43 m\/s. Then the\npower output of the siphon as an air pump is 24.3 kW per\nsquare metre of pipe cross-section. The losses amount to\n1.9 kW drift loss, and 14.1 kW friction and exit loss, both\nper square metre of pipe cross-section. The ef\u008e ciency is\n0.60. In practice, a water speed intermediate between\nthese two values is needed to optimize the cost of power.\n3.5 Aerator height\nContinuing with the example from the previous section,\nlet us select the water velocity v\u02c6 2.30 m\/s, which is\nintermediate between the values for maximum ef\u008e ciency\nand maximum power. The head loss Kv2\/(2g) is then\n0.19 m; therefore the buoyancy head B is 1.01 m.\nAs noted in Section 2, the maximum void fraction at\nwhich bubbly \u008f ow can be maintained is a\u02c6 0.3. This\ncorresponds to x\u02c6 0.3\/0.7 \u02c6 0.429, since x is the\nvolumetric ratio of air to water while a is the ratio of\nair to the total volume. To allow a margin of safety, a\nsmaller value of x, say, 0.35, corresponding to a\u02c6 0.26,\nis taken.\nThe pressure pC is approximately atmospheric, say\n100 kN\/m2. Using equation (12),\n1\nr\nln r \u02c6 0:283 \u202617\u2020\nand hence\nr \u02c6 pC\npA\n\u02c6 1:555 \u202618\u2020\nFinally, using these results in equation (8), the height of\nthe aerator is obtained as yA\u02c6 4.65 m, this being the\nheight above the point C at the exit from the downward\nleg of the siphon. If the exit point C is taken to be a\ndistance d\u02c6 0.3 m below the level of the water surface,\nthen above the downstream water level the height is\n0.3 m less than this, 4.35 m. Above the upstream level the\nheight is 3.15 m.\n4 RANGE OF APPLICATION OF THE SIPHON\nHYDRO PLANT\n4.1 Simple siphon\nIn the siphon plant described, the head H of water at the\nweir is opposed by the buoyancy head of the air bubbles\nand by losses, including the inlet and exit losses.\nEquation (11) sets this out in mathematical terms.

(In the example shown in\nSubsection 3.4.1 and Section 3.5 above, when operating\nat maximum ef\u008e ciency the buoyancy head B is 1.06 m,\nand the head corresponding to the friction and exit losses\nis 0.14 m. It is of interest that, even if the loss coef\u008e cient\nis doubled to K \u02c6 1.4, at maximum ef\u008e ciency the\nbuoyancy head is almost unchanged: 1.08 m.)\nThere is a limit to the buoyancy head B. (This limit\ndoes not apply in the case of the hydraulic compressor, in\nwhich atmospheric pressure is at the inlet to the column,\nand not at the bottom.) The pressure pC is close to\natmospheric, and xA, the volumetric ratio of air to water\nat the aerator, has a maximum practical value of about\n0.35. In equation (12), the factor\n1\nr\nln r\nhas a maximum value e\u00a11, or 0.368, which occurs when\nr\u02c6 e.\nTaking these values with pC\u02c6 100 kN\/m2, it is found\nthat the maximum possible value of B is 1.31 m. For an\nair-pumping ef\u008e ciency of 70 per cent or more, this limits\nthe driving head at the weir, H, to about 1.7 m at the most.\nThis value for H can be increased if a lower ef\u008e ciency is\nacceptable, or if a greater value of xA can be achieved.\nHowever, xA is unlikely to be capable of very much\nimprovement; therefore, as weir heights rise beyond\nabout 1.7 m a single-stage siphon must inevitably\nbecome less and less ef\u008e cient.\n4.2 Two-stage siphon\nThe range of operation of the siphon can be extended by\nintroducing air into the descending water column AC at\nmore than one point in its length. As the water\u2013air\nmixture descends from A, the pressure increases and the\nvolume of the air decreases; it is then possible to\nintroduce further air. It is theoretically possible to do this\nat any number of points, successive points being at\ngradually higher pressures. In practice it is unlikely that\nmore than two aeration points would be used in the\ndescending column because of the complexity intro-\nduced. In cases where the water head at the weir is greater\nthan about 2 m, rather than using two-stage siphons, it\nwould seem better to use an intermediate side pond,\nextracting the energy from the water with two successive\nsiphon systems.\n5 PRACTICAL ISSUES\n5.1 Ice formation and trash\nBecause of the drop in temperature through the turbine,\nunder a variety of conditions, ice will appear in the air in\na form like powder snow. The general effect of moist air\nis bene\u008e cial, since it improves the turbine ef\u008e ciency due\nto reheat from the condensation. Ice is only likely to be\ntroublesome in some parts of the manifolding, where it\nmay prove necessary to adopt electrical heating. How-\never, this is likely to cost less than the bene\u008e ts of reheat;\ntherefore, surprisingly, the formation of ice is expected to\nimprove performance overall.\nAny trash that enters the siphon may lodge on aerators,\netc., and thus trash screens are desirable. However, in this\nsystem, trash is unlikely to cause damage, as it may in\nwater turbines.\n5.2 Turbine types and matching\nRadial air turbines, made in large numbers by turbo-\ncharger manufacturers, are the obvious choice for early\ndevelopment, even though slightly better ef\u008e ciencies are\nto be had with axial \u008f ow turbines. Operating at ambient\ntemperatures and below, the turbines can be made in less\nspecialized materials than those of turbochargers, which\nhave to withstand engine exhaust temperatures. Turbine\nef\u008e ciencies of 80\u201385 per cent should be readily\nachievable.\nWith variable water \u008f owrates in rivers, steps have to\nbe taken to match the siphon and turbine plant to the\navailable water \u008f ow. On large rivers this can be\naccommodated by switching units in and out; as many\nas forty siphons and four turbines at weirs in some\nlocations may be needed. With reduced \u008f ow in such a\ncase, one or two siphons per turbine would be emptied,\nuntil one turbine needed to be shut down, and so on.\n5.3 Costs\nThe capital cost of the siphon type of hydro plant per\ninstalled kilowatt is expected to be attractively low\ncompared with an equivalent plant based on water\nturbines, owing to the small size of the machinery, its\nconvenient location above water level and the simplicity\nof the civil engineering work. The costs are especially\nlow where an existing weir can be utilized but, even when\na new weir has to be built, the capital cost is still likely to\nbe lower than other forms of hydro plant.\nThe overall ef\u008e ciency of the plant, while less than that\nof conventional hydro plant, should be at least 60 per\ncent. Unless there is a water shortage, when ef\u008e ciency\nmay become very important, the low \u008e rst cost and capital\ncharges of the siphon plant should make it very\ncompetitive in the low-head hydro market.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nThe hydropower system based on pressure-exchanging\nA00700 \u00d3 IMechE 2001 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A\nTHE EXPLOITATION OF LOW-HEAD HYDROPOWER BY PRESSURE INTERCHANGEWITH AIR 229\nsiphons offers the prospect of harnessing power econom-\nically from the large number of potential low-head hydro\nsites which are not viable using water turbines. Air-\npumping ef\u008e ciencies of 70 per cent or better should be\nachievable; overall ef\u008e ciency should be better than 60 per\ncent. Although such values of ef\u008e ciency are lower than\nusually found in hydro plant, siphon installations should\nbe economically attractive owing to the relatively low\ncapital cost of the system.\nIn single-stage form the system is suitable for heads up\nto about 1.7 m. For higher heads, the system can be used\nin two or more stages, either by introducing air into the\ndescending water column at more than one point or by\nusing intermediate side ponds.\nREFERENCES\n1 Moreira, J.
