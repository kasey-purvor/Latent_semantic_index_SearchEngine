It dipped to approximately 70.5% a few years later and has slowly climbed back to where it was in 1994, before the boom in CRM investment. 2 Google Scholar estimates that this article has been cited 906 times (accessed 27.10.07). 3 The authors corresponded directly with Professor Webster about the consolidation of his seven stages of marketing relationships into the three we present in this paper. 4 Both the auto manufacturer and the online betting company remain anonymous. 5 Scenario planning is a means by which organisations plan for highly uncertain futures, where extrapolations from current trends are inadequate. Planners identify drivers of discontinuous change, in this example online distribution, and build business models for radically different futures.

Pine et al (1995) argued that customers would relish ever\nmore personalised service and would co-develop solutions with supply\nnetworks (Hagel and Singer Marc, 2000) to unleash greater value-in-use for\ntheir purchases (Vargo and Lusch, 2004). Companies would also benefit from\nthis fundamental shift since most customers inherently value relationships\n(Sheth and Parvatiyar, 1995) and small increases in customer retention would\ndeliver significant increases in profitability over the lifetime of these\nrelationships (Reichheld, 1996).\nIn reality, events have turned out very differently. Between 2000 and 2005,\nfirms invested $220 billion in CRM solutions (Payne, 2006) and yet the\nmajority of firms fail to deliver targeted ROI on their investments (Roberts, Liu\nand Hazard, 2005; Rigby, Reichheld and Schefter, 2002;\nPricewaterhouseCoopers, 2002). Customer satisfaction levels have not\nimproved during this time either; the US customer satisfaction index has\nbarely changed over the past decade1. In fact, we would argue that it is one of\nthe great paradoxes of these unprecedented levels of marketing investment in\nCRM that has left customers ever more cynical and disloyal.\nThe literature dealing with CRM successes and failures highlights the critical\nrole of culture (Bohling, Bowman, LaValle et al, 2006; Shah, Rust,\nParasuraman et al, 2006; Kale, 2004), organisational alignment (Boulding,\n5Staelin, Ehret et al, 2005; Roberts, Liu and Hazard, 2005) appropriate use of\ncustomer lifetime value analysis (Ryals, 2005; Reinartz and Kumar, 2002;\nVenkatesan and Kumar, 2004) and motivating employees to improve\ncustomer management (Zablah, Bellenger and Johnston, 2004; Bohling,\nBowman et al, 2006).\nHowever, we believe that CRM can be severely compromised even before the\nimplementation process begins and the above factors impact the outcomes.\nThis is because the discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis that dominates\nbusiness case thinking often locks marketers into CRM strategies before they\nhave learnt how customers wish to engage with the firm (Maklan, Knox and\nRyals, 2005). The traditional business case assumes that, as a result of CRM\ninvestment, consumer behaviour will change by a pre determined amount in\norder to justify the incremental revenue identified in the business case. Thus,\nthe CRM sequence is regarded as linear: analysis-business case-investment-\nto acquire resources-implement CRM-change consumer behaviour-profit.\nWe do not regard such a linear approach is appropriate for CRM investment\ndecision making and adopt a Dynamic Capabilities perspective (Teece,\nPisano and Shuen, 1997) which suggests that CRM investment must account\nfor the heterogeneity of individual firms\u2019 CRM resources and capabilities. Not\nall firms can successfully implement the CRM strategy and processes offered\nby CRM software vendors, particularly when their dynamic CRM capabilities\nare lacking.\n6In this paper, we argue that companies have invested heavily in CRM\nresources (databases, web sites, analytical tools, call centres) but\ninsufficiently in the Dynamic Capabilities required to select, develop and\ndeploy these CRM resources effectively (Teece, Pisano et al, 1997). We\nfurther argue that this arises because Dynamic Capabilities are grounded in\nmanagers\u2019 tacit knowledge of the business and are therefore notoriously\ndifficult to identify, let alone manage. We explore how such Dynamic\nCapabilities can be surfaced using Action Research amongst the\nmanagement of two organisations facing major CRM investment decisions:\ndecisions that would have profound implications for marketing strategy. In\nboth instances, an emergent approach to building the firm\u2019s CRM investment\nstrategy led to a much greater awareness of the Dynamic Capabilities needed\nto support CRM and to changes in how customer relationship investment was\nmanaged. First, we provide the context for our research, that is, the\ncompanies involved and the marketing\/customer relationship problems faced\nby each. Then we describe our research method and process, and the results\nwhich led to the surfacing of tacit knowledge about the Dynamic Capabilities\nin each firm and how investment in marketing resources was subsequently\ndeveloped as a result. We close the paper with a section on the limitations of\nour research and offer directions for further research.\nIn the next section, we briefly explore the literature on Dynamic Capabilities;\nhow it has evolved from the Resource Based View, its definition and why the\nnature of Dynamic Capabilities has blurred both the development of theory\nand practice in this area.\n7What are Dynamic Capabilities and why have they\nbeen overlooked?\nThe Resource Based View (RBV) is the dominant theory in Strategy literature\n(Newbert, 2007); it explains sustained, superior performance as a function of\nthe heterogeneity of firm-specific resources such as brands, customer\nrelationships and distribution partnerships (Barney, 1991). Marketing scholars\nintuitively appreciate the link between such resources and competitiveness.\nIndeed, RBV is considered by some to be the theoretical core of marketing\n(Day and Van den Bulte, 2002; Day, 1999b; Srivastava, Shervani and Fahey,\n1998; Hunt, 2000). However, others feel that RBV has failed to make a major\ncontribution to our understanding of competitiveness as the definition of\nresources is vague and tautological (Priem and Butler, 2001). The theory of\nDynamic Capabilities side-steps this criticism by focusing less upon identifying\nthe \u201cstatic\u201d advantage-creating resources, such as brands, to focus more\nupon exploring how these resources are created and used for competitive\nadvantage. Thus, our definition of this phenomenon is as follows:\n\u201cDynamic capabilities are the antecedent organisational and\nstrategic routines by which managers alter their resource\nbase\u2026.to create new value-creating strategies. \u2026They are the\ndrivers behind the creation, evolution and recombination of other\nresources into new sources of competitive advantage\u201d\n(Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000:1107).\n8This definition implies that the firm is better able than its competitors at\nlearning from customers (Vargo and Lusch, 2004), more adept at changing\ncore business processes and routines (Winter, 2003; Eisenhardt and Martin,\n2000) and continually reconfigures, enhances and deploys (Rindova and\nKotha, 2001; Teece, Pisano and Shuen, 1997) resources in a manner that\ncreates superior customer value and hence superior performance in the\nmarketplace.\nHowever, the vary nature of these Dynamic Capabilities means that they are\nvery difficult to manage and develop. Scholars liken the challenge of\nidentifying and managing them to \u201cobserving the unobservable\u201d (Rouse and\nDaellenbach, 1999; Godfrey and Hill, 1995). Dynamic Capabilities arise from\nthe everyday tasks of the firm\u2019s employees (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000) and\nare often the unquestioned \u201chow we do things around here\u201d activities that\npermit some firms to distinguish themselves, for example, by providing better\ncustomer service than their competitors. They are grounded in tacit\nknowledge (Polanyi, 1976) which ensures that they are not easily\ndocumented, transferred internally between business units and, more\nimportantly, cannot readily be imitated by competitors. Dynamic Capabilities\nexist in complex bundles with other capabilities and resources (Black and\nBoal, 1994). It is therefore difficult for managers to identify, let alone assess\nthe impact of any one Dynamic Capability on market performance. In certain\ncircumstances, Dynamic Capabilities can be linked to competitive advantage\nand ultimately to superior profitability but, because of the inherent difficulties\nof managing and measuring these internal drivers, casual ambiguity rather\n9clouds the picture and can deter empirical research among marketing\nscholars.\nThis management problem in most organisations is further compounded by\nour assertion that it is unclear as to who exactly is responsible for ensuring\ntheir development. Change programmes arising from new business\nprocesses, such as CRM, are directed almost exclusively by the IT function\n(CSC Index, 1994). Therefore, we posit that those in charge of CRM\nimplementation view the development of relationship marketing capability as\nlittle more than training marketers to use the new technology and to deploy\nrelated business processes, rather than helping marketers to innovate new\nmarketing programmes that affect customers\u2019 attitudes and behaviours\nfavourably. Even where the CRM investment leaders do go further and\nprovide individual skills development for marketers, we would argue that\nDynamic Capabilities are not merely the sum of individuals\u2019 knowledge (Teece\nand Pisano, 1994); they originate and grow within the firm through employee\ncollaboration. Thus, the focus on Dynamic Capability development must be at\na team level.\nPresenting a framework for surfacing and developing\nDynamic Capabilities\nMarketing managers lack a pragmatic framework to first identifying and then\ndeveloping the Dynamic Capabilities needed to invest in CRM successfully\n(Maklan, 2004). The authors develop such a framework for consumer markets\n10\n(Figure 1) from the extant work of both Webster (1992) and Coviello et al\n(2002) albeit the authors focus on consumer marketing.\nWebster\u2019s widely cited article2 identifies a shift in the conceptualisation of\nmarketing to help organisations align internal operations to support different\ntypes of marketing relationships. He identifies a seven point continuum of\nmarketing relationships: transactions, repeated transactions, long term\nrelationships, buyer-seller partnerships, strategic alliances, network\norganisations and vertical integration. In order to develop a conceptual\nframework that can be made operational by managers, we further reduced\nWebster\u2019s continuum3 to three main types of marketing relationships:\n\uf0a7 Transactional \u2013 comprising that which Webster identified as\ntransactions and repeated transactions\n\uf0a7 One to one relationship \u2013 comprising long term relationships and\nbuyer-seller partnerships\n\uf0a7 Networked \u2013 comprising strategic alliances and network organisations\nAdditional support for our reductionalist approach can be found in the strategy\nliterature. Thompson et al (1991) argue that consumers fulfil their needs for\ngoods and services by choosing between three purchasing strategies: the\nmarket place (transactional relationship), hierarchical relationships (Malone,\nYates and Benjamin, 1987) or networks of consumers (Hagel and Armstrong,\n1997).\n11\nCoviello et al (2002) have a similar view of the forms of possible marketing\nrelationships albeit they divide that which we term \u201crelationship\u201d into two forms\nof marketing: database and interaction marketing. They show that firms\ndeploy a mixture of marketing practices that can be categorised by the form of\nmarketing relationship by which firms engage with their consumers. Instead of\ninvestigating marketing practices like Coviello, this paper explores the\nDynamic Capabilities of marketing which are developed from the extant\nliterature on the role and function of marketing within the organisation\n(Appendix 1). This conceptual framework was generated from a database\nliterature search based on combinations of the search string \u201cthe role and\nfunction of marketing\u201d. Our preliminary analysis of the literature reveals that\nthe discussion of marketing capabilities was centred largely in this literature\nwhich has subsequently been validated by a cross disciplinary review panel\nconsisting of senior academics from the Marketing, Strategy and Information\nTechnology domains.\nOur content analysis of the literature identifies four principal Dynamic\nCapabilities in marketing:\n\uf0b7 Demand management \u2013 generating revenue for goods and services.\n\uf0b7 Creating marketing knowledge \u2013 generating and disseminating \u2013\nthroughout the firm - insight about consumers, markets, competitors,\nenvironmental trends, distributors, alliance partners and online\ncommunities.\n\uf0b7 Building brands \u2013 creating and maintaining brands for products, services\nand the organisation.\n12\n\uf0b7 Customer relationship management (CRM) \u2013 developing how the firm\nrelates to consumers.\nDuring the 1970s, marketing capabilities were defined in the context of facilitating\ntransactions between firms and consumers (Kotler, 1972). The 1980s and 1990s\nsaw the emergence of marketing as building relationships with consumers on a\none-to-one basis (Pine, Peppers and Rogers, 1995) or through relationship\nmarketing programmes (Christopher, Payne, and Ballantyne, 1991). As the\ninternet grew in popularity, marketing scholars explored a new paradigm based\nupon networks of customers and their supply chains (Achrol and Kotler, 1999).\nThis categorisation of three distinctive forms of marketing relationships resolves\nthe apparent contradictions in the literature and is endorsed both by marketing\nscholars (Coviello, Brodie et al, 2002) and strategy colleagues alike (Thompson\net al, 1991). Our framework, therefore, is defined by a matrix comprising these\nfour Dynamic Capabilities set against a continuum of the three forms of marketing\nrelationships between the firm and its customers (Figure 1):\n13\nFigure 1: A Framework of Dynamic Capabilities in Marketing\nTransactional\nrelationship\nOne-to-one\nrelationship\nNetworked\nrelationship\nDemand\nmanagement\nSelling Lifetime value Co-creating value\nCreating\nmarketing\nknowledge\nMarket\nsegments\nIndividual\nconsumer needs\nand purchasing\nstyles\nKey network\nparticipants and\nshapers\nBuilding brands Product and\nservice brands\nCompany brands Network\ncapabilities\nCustomer\nrelationship\nmanagement\n(CRM)\nContractual,\nstandardised\ncustomer\ntreatment\nDifferentiated,\ncustomised and\nor negotiated\nSelf-managed\nconsumers\nleveraging\ncolleagues\u2019\nknow- how online\nUsing this Framework\nThe Action Research Method\nAs Dynamic Capabilities are highly context specific and grounded in tacit\nknowledge, identifying and understanding them requires enquiry from within\nthe firm (Susman and Evered, 1978; Rouse and Daellenbach, 1999). To\nenable such internal deliberations, we adopted an Action Research approach\n(Reason and Torbert, 2001) with the managers responsible for developing\nCRM in the two focal firms reported here.\nAction Research is a form of participatory enquiry. In this instance, the\nmanagers responsible for the successful development of CRM engage in\ncycles of reflection and action over a period of time using our framework\n(Figure 1) to generate the knowledge that they require to improve their day-to-\n14\nday performance. These cycles of reflection and action raise managers\u2019 tacit\nunderstanding of their CRM-related routines and surface Dynamic Capabilities\nto the extent that they can ultimately be identified and managed. Action\nResearch develops effective learning systems in companies (Argyris and\nSch\u00f6n, 1978), inspires commitment to change (Clark, 1972) and can\ntransform CRM practices (Heron and Reason, 1999). Such enquiries are led\nby the managers and conducted in their interests. Eden and Huxham (1996)\npropose certain criteria for ensuring Action Research is rigorous and\ncontributes to scholarship. In order to contribute to scholarship, the research\nmust have implications beyond the immediate decisions to be taken by\nmanagers in the two cases presented: in this instance, the emerging theory of\nDynamic Capabilities which we contribute to developing in the context of\nmarketing. The rigour of the research, its recoverability (Checkland and\nHolwell, 1998) and ability to be assessed, arises from the method and\norderliness concerning the processes of collecting and reflecting upon the\ndata generated from the two companies reported.\nAction Research Practices\nThe companies formed cross-functional enquiry teams to assess their CRM\nstrategies. The team leaders chaired initial meetings that established the\nprinciples of the research; that is, the authors and team members were equal\nco-researchers engaging in cycles of reflection and action in order to improve\nmanagers\u2019 practice as well as to create more generalised learning. The teams\nagreed to a series of workshops in which participating managers prepared\n15\nformal presentations based upon workshop tools developed by the authors\n(Appendix 2). This preparation, combined with group discussions and\nagreement, promoted the cycles of learning and generated the core set of\ndata and artefacts for analysis. The workshop tools were continually modified\nby the teams consistent with the democratic nature of Action Research.\nEach workshop was recorded by the authors to enable preparation for future\nworkshops, briefings and discussion. These tapes were listened to shortly\nafter each session alongside a review of all the material generated. We\nfollowed the Argyris (1973) method of dividing a page vertically, noting the key\nconversation points on the left-hand side whilst on the right-hand side noting\nreflections during the session and reflections upon reviewing the tape. The\nauthors also contributed expertise in workshops and to briefing material: a\nrole that was acknowledged and appreciated by the others in the enquiry\nteams. In this form of Action Research, the method by which data is analysed\nand theory emerges is highly contextual and dependent upon the specific time\nand circumstances of the enquiries. The process, nonetheless, is highly\nreplicable because it is transparent; however, other researchers following the\nsame method with another enquiry team may not be able to replicate the\nresults. The method produces results, in the language of Eden and Huxham,\nis more demonstrable than it is replicable; Checkland and Howell (1998) use\nthe term \u201crecoverable\u201d to mean what Eden and Huxham call demonstrable\nand that permits readers of Action Research papers to assess the quality of\nthe decisions taken and conclusions drawn.\n16\nAt the end of the research process, the authors met with team members\nindividually and, using a semi structured questionnaire, probed to ensure that\nthe process was democratic, the team\u2019s conclusions were accepted by the\nindividual as valid and that the individuals were committed to the outcomes\nand actions agreed. Commitment to action agreed through valid information is\na key test of Action Research\u2019s validity (Argyris, 1973; Clark, 1972). In total,\nthe authors analysed over 60 hours of recorded contact time and several\nhundred pages of artefacts.\nThe Action Research Process\nFigure 2 describes the process by which the two management teams used\nour Dynamic Capabilities framework. The framework allows each team to\ndevelop firm-specific management tools which they then use in a series of\nworkshops over two to three months to develop a shared understanding of\ntheir current and future marketing Dynamic Capabilities in order to implement\ntheir customer strategies more effectively. A fuller explanation of these tools\nand how they were used is provided in Appendix 2.\n17\nTo reduce complexity and circumvent the non-linear nature of this type of\nresearch, each study is presented to the reader in short format using the\nfollowing logic flow:\n1.

The selection of our enquiries follows the\nadvice offered by Eisenhardt (1989) that studies should embrace the\nextremes of a phenomenon. That is, Car-Co is an established, brand-led\nmanufacturing company whilst Bet-Co was a start up dot.com; they are at\nopposite ends of the spectrum with regard to CRM investment and\nimplementation. In Action Research, there is inevitably an element of\nconvenience sampling to ensure that it is the managers who invite the enquiry\nrather than the other way round.\nBoth companies faced market-place challenges which suggested they needed\neither to invest more or invest differently in CRM. In both cases, the marketing\nmanagers responsible decided first to evaluate and shape these investment\ndecisions themselves. By agreeing to engage with us in Action Research\ndesigned to introduce a greater visibility of their respective Dynamic\nCapabilities supporting CRM, they are acknowledging the need to evaluate\nboth together. In particular, both teams were looking to make explicit their\nassumptions about the inter-relationship between their CRM resources and\nrelated Dynamic Capabilities in order to develop marketing practices which\noptimised their firm\u2019s overall CRM investments.\n19\nBet-Co\nBet-Co was a pioneer in offering a web-based means for consumers to\nnegotiate bets directly with other consumers. The founders expected that the\nsocial interaction it offered would create a unique community locking in\nconsumers and their online betting friends exclusively to the Bet-Co site. The\nservice was launched in the UK using traditional mass marketing strategies\nand attracted the largest number of online betters. Simultaneously, a rival\nentered the market with a betting exchange that aggregated and resolved\nbets anonymously, thus avoiding the time and complexity of having to parcel\nlarge bets for individual takers. The exchange appealed to the serious better\nand by the end of the launch year, the rival had 50% of the market versus Bet-\nCo\u2019s 4%. In response, Bet-Co relaunched its service as a betting exchange.\nThe marketing managers felt that they needed to offer some relationship-\nbased advantages to its larger competitor in order to convince large betters to\nuse its site which was far less liquid due to the lower level of aggregate\nbetting.\nAt the start of the Action Research enquiry, Bet-Co managers considered that\nthey were retreating from relationship marketing into transactional marketing.\nHowever, through the enquiry process, they discovered that they had been\neffectively compensating for Bet-Co\u2019s lack of liquidity (versus its larger rival),\nincreasing betting activity on its site whilst maintaining the necessary balance\nof backers and layers, winners and losers across a variety of betting interests.\nIf, for example, a major backer of greyhounds was active, managers knew\nthat the site would need to compensate with the activity of 20 layers because\n20\nof the relative propensities for backing and laying amongst its greyhound\nbetters. They had also developed a profound insight into their supply chain,\nknowing which of their partner web sites refer a lot of greyhound layers.\nManagers would increase incentives to those sites rich in greyhound-layer\nreferrals to maintain the balance of backing and laying on the site and thus\nallow bets to clear. Underpinning this impressive network marketing was a\nprofound insight into the betting preferences and behaviours of its largest\nbetters and those betters whose standing in the community made them\nmarket-makers: people with a following who could build a market for Bet-Co\nquickly. Instead of Bet-Co retreating to transactional marketing, the enquiry\nteam understood that it had moved from relationship to network marketing.\nTasks undertaken as part of the enquiry confirmed that its network marketing\ncapabilities were more advanced than its larger competitor as was its\ncustomer insight resource. It was decided that this combination of resource\nand Dynamic Capability was the basis of future competitiveness.\nThe nature of Action Research and the cycles of action and reflection meant\nthat by the time the team decided to wind up the formal enquiry process,\nmany of the agreed new Dynamic Capabilities had already been\nimplemented. A new customer service programme distinguished key market-\nmakers from large betters and provided differentiated services to each group.\nA previously discontinued customer bulletin board was reinstated. Special\nprogrammes were devised for bookmakers.\n21\nIn the year that Bet-Co changed its business model from peer-to-peer betting\nto an exchange, and engaged in the Action Research process, its market\nshare rose to 30%.\nCar-Co\nCar-Co is the exclusive UK importer and distributor of Car-Co cars and is\nfully-owned by its worldwide holding company. Established in 1980, it has\nenjoyed sales growth in all but one of its nearly 30 years of trading.\nThe European Union (EU) had been reviewing Block Exemption, a let-out\nclause to the EU\u2019s free trade regime wherein car manufacturers could\nestablish exclusive national distributors who in turn could assign exclusive\nsales territories to independent car dealers. It was accepted that the Block\nExemption would be relaxed but no one was sure to what extent and its likely\nimpact on automobile sales. Some worried that radical liberalisation would\ncreate more dealers, new and innovative channels to market and increased\nprice competition, all of which would depress Car-Co\u2019s profit margins.\nAgainst this backdrop, Car-Co\u2019s global centre was encouraging its national\ndistributors to fund an ambitious new global CRM initiative. The UK company\nwas already three years into its own, less ambitious, CRM programme but\nhad not finished its implementation nor realised substantial economic benefit\nfrom it. A cross functional enquiry team led by Marketing set out to determine\nfuture CRM investment policy.\n22\nWhilst the strength of Car-Co\u2019s global brand and its design and engineering\ncapabilities undoubtedly drive customers to the dealerships, the enquiry\nrevealed other Dynamic Capabilities that are also critical to its UK success:\ndealer and brand management. The Car-Co brand benefited from a level of\nconsistency in positioning and advertising almost unknown in consumer\nmarketing, evidenced by the fact that Car-Co has only had one ad agency in\nthe UK which has engendered deep and profound understanding of the brand\nby a consistent cadre of managers. Car-Co also benefited from dealer\nrelationships that were far more collaborative than is the norm in an industry\ncharacterised by acrimonious relationships between manufacturers and their\ndealers. The trust and commitment to common goals had kept discounting to\na minimum and allowed higher residual car values, enhanced customer\nexperience and made for more effective new car introductions.\nHowever, managers worried that the Dynamic Capabilities that drive success\ntoday could prove less important in a radically liberalised, multi-channel\nenvironment. The dealer network, today a source of competitive advantage,\nwas vulnerable to leaner, hungrier, CRM-savvy new channels. Allied to this\nconcern was a realisation that the company knew very little about individual\nconsumers because they dealt with the dealers only and not Car-Co directly.\nHence managers were concerned that if the distribution environment and\nconsumer behaviour changed radically, Car-Co could be left with a high cost\ndealer network and little ability to influence consumer experience and\nbehaviour through the emerging new channels.\n23\nDuring the enquiry, managers used the capability framework in a scenario\nplanning5 context to build capabilities models and marketing approaches for\nvarying degrees of change. Under a scenario of radical change, managers\nbuilt a competency model characteristic of networked consumer relationships.\nThey concluded that the changes in its marketing Dynamic Capabilities\nrequired to implement network marketing were contingent upon creating\nmarketing knowledge consistent with a one-to-one consumer relationship.\nWithout more individualised consumer understanding, it was not possible to\nchange the remaining three Dynamic Capabilities. The firm\u2019s commitment to\nmake these changes was not judged to be a realistic proposition without an\nimmediate and serious threat to its business; there was too much uncertainty\nabout any future distribution scenario to mobilise the organisation.\nThe managerial insights prompted a more considered approach to CRM\ninvestment. Car-Co (UK) concluded it would not be an early adaptor of the\nproposed corporate CRM system. Rather, it would focus its resources on\nfinishing and leveraging its existing CRM programme and creating an owners\u2019\nweb site. Managers also decided to quicken the pace at which it could build\nconsumer insight by taking the management of online consumer\ncommunication in-house and its associated analytic functions, reversing a\nprevious decision to use third parties. In essence, Car-Co was making a \u201creal\noption\u201d6 investment (Maklan, Knox et al, 2005), a limited expenditure\nimmediately to learn more about one-to-one marketing in order to permit it to\ninvest in a more ambitious CRM programme in the future should changes in\n24\nconsumer behaviour and UK distribution networks warrant it. The competency\nframework identifies the critical Dynamic Capability in which management\nneeded to invest immediately in order to permit that strategy to be realised.\nFindings about the Nature of Marketing Dynamic\nCapabilities\nThe authors acknowledge that findings from our two Action Research\nenquiries are not generalisable. Nonetheless, the role of reflective learning\nand the combination of inductive and deductive thinking in theory\ndevelopment are widely acknowledged in literature (Langley, 1999; Eden and\nHuxham, 1996; Eisenhardt, 1989; Argyris and Sch\u00f6n, 1978). Therefore, we\noffer the following findings as input to the process of Dynamic Capabilities\ntheory development:\n1. Dynamic Capabilities can be observed, managed and researched but the\nprocess of observation cannot easily be detached from their development.\nThe tacit knowledge underpinning the Dynamic Capabilities supporting CRM\nwas surfaced through cycles of reflection without compromising the firms\u2019\nability to create competitive advantage (Ambrosini and Bowman, 2001). This\nsupports the views of those who believe that RBV research must occur within\nthe organisation and over a series of participative interactions (Rouse and\nDaellenbach, 1999); detached, expert analysis is unlikely to promote the\ndiscovery process needed to observe capabilities that are grounded in tacit\nknowledge and organisational routines.\n25\n2. Dynamic Capabilities develop incrementally along a continuum defined by\ntransactional, one-to-one and network marketing relationships.\nIn both cases, managers moved incrementally along this marketing\ncapabilities continuum. Bet-Co launched by recruiting many betters to a\ntransactional relationship. Over time, it developed better insight and services\nfor its key betters (one-to-one \/ relationship marketing) and based on this\ninsight, the company was able to compensate across the site for the\nbehaviour of key betters and leverage its market-making betters for growth\n(network marketing). Car-Co managers, on the other hand, experimented with\nnetwork marketing in workshops but could not imagine how it would be\nprofitable because they lacked the relationship marketing capabilities to\nunderstand fully how they would develop and profit from it. Instead, Car-Co\nmanagers plan to build consumer insight and use that as the foundation of\nany future relationship marketing investment. This finding suggests that\ninvestment plans based upon companies\u2019 ability to \u201cleap-frog\u201d from a very\ntransactional approach to \u201cbest practice\u201d relationship marketing (or even\nnetwork marketing) is likely to fail. A company\u2019s current marketing Dynamic\nCapabilities limit its customer strategy options.\n3. The Dynamic Capabilities of marketing are interdependent.\nA firm cannot hope to generate demand associated with relationship\nmarketing without having the necessary consumer insight, brand building and\nrelationship management capabilities. Capability changes are multifaceted\nand do not usually occur simultaneously in a big-bang fashion. Both the firms\nwe report on here found that their current capabilities reflect a mix of\n26\ntransaction, relationship and network marketing, although one particular kind\nof marketing capability was usually dominant. This finding has a direct parallel\nwith Coviello et al (2002) who found that firms have a mixture of marketing\npractices across similarly defined forms of marketing.\n4. The rate of capability change seems to depend on the industry context.\nCar-Co will develop its relationship marketing capabilities carefully over time;\nhowever, the consumer purchase cycle in that industry is approximately three\nyears. Bet-Co evolved from transaction to relationship to network marketing in\napproximately one year. Its best customers used its site several times a day.\nThis frequent contact allowed Bet-Co managers to experiment continually with\ndifferent customer treatment strategies and therefore learn more quickly about\nits customers than Car-Co could. It is unlikely therefore that a one-size-fits-all\napproach to implementing CRM will prove successful; the market context\ncreates boundary conditions for the speed of implementation. Moreover, we\nmaintain that it would be unwise to accelerate rapidly the implementation of\nCRM, because capability development speed is, in part, limited by the market\ncontext.\nManagerial Implications\nAt the beginning of this paper, the authors suggest that the level of CRM\ninvestment failure is unacceptably high and this is usually because firms\ninvest in marketing resources without paying sufficient attention to developing\n27\nthe Dynamic Capabilities that are needed to make these investments\nsuccessful. Our findings offer both hope and challenge to managers.\nDynamic Capabilities theory reassures marketing management that they can\nimprove their CRM investments, provided they ensure that managerial\npractices and organisational routines evolve to support their core marketing\nresources. In addition, any investment in developing Dynamic Capabilities\nshould coincide with, or even precede, investment in CRM resources.\nCapabilities require the active participation of managers in their development\nand will not develop automatically from resource investment. Makadok (2001)\nidentifies a split amongst RBV scholars between resource pickers and\nresource builders; our research suggests managers must do both to be\nsuccessful in CRM.\nManagers directly concerned with customer management must lead the\nprocess of building Dynamic Capabilities needed to support CRM investment.\nThe use of third parties, particularly when they wish merely to modify\nstandardised, replicable CRM programmes, should be approached with\nextreme caution. The process of identifying and then developing Dynamic\nCapabilities requires the surfacing of tacit knowledge; by definition this is\nhighly contextual and defies rote adoption of universal \u201cbest practice\u201d CRM.\nAction Research is a legitimate means of achieving this managerial goal.\nFinally, the investment case for CRM, its targets and its subsequent\nimplementation policies, must acknowledge certain limitations upon the ability\n28\nof managers to select any customer strategy that they chose (Mintzberg,\nAhlstrand, and Lampel, 1998) and the timing of the business benefits.\nDynamic Capabilities represent a boundary condition; a company is limited by\nits current capabilities and the rate at which those capabilities develop is, in\npart, determined by the market in which the firm operates.\nLimitations and Further Research\nThe findings of this paper are based on only two qualitative studies and are\nnot generalisable in the same way that a positivist approach using a\nrepresentative sample of companies would be. As mentioned earlier, in order\nto carry out Action Research effectively, both privileged access and a state of\nreadiness among the participating management team are required if our\nmethodology of collaborative enquiry is to provide evidence of staged\nprogress for these managers and also to validate our results. Inevitably, this\ninvolves purposeful sampling and the limitations associated with such small\nsample sizes. Nonetheless, scholars have been calling for increased usage\nof rich-data methodologies to address the conceptual difficulties of observing\nDynamic Capabilities through traditional surveys or longitudinal studies (Miller,\nEisenstat and Foote, 2002) which added to our conviction that our chosen\nmethodology was fit for purpose in this instance (Rouse and Daellenbach,\n1999).\nThe authors identify two areas for further research. Action Research\ncontributes to theory through cycles of action and reflection and, although it is\nnot possible to replicate enquiries due to their context specific nature, similar\n29\nenquiries would enhance our understanding of Dynamic Capabilities and\nCRM. Enquiries in industries that invest heavily in CRM systems may be\nparticularly instructive, for instance, financial services, telephony and utilities.\nA second strand of research would be to work with companies in developing\nscale measures of Dynamic Capabilities and relate them to measures of\neither CRM success or business performance. Such research would allow\nmanagement teams engaged in Action Research to measure their\nachievements and provide an incentive for enquiries to go further and deeper\ninto Dynamic Capability development.\n30\nAppendix One: The formative literature on Dynamic Capabilities\nForm of marketing Author(s) Focus of research\nTransaction\nMarketing\nLevitt (1960; 1986) Creating consumer demand.\nKotler (1969; 1972) Facilitating voluntary exchange.\nSheth (1973) Industrial buying framework.\nBagozzi (1974; 1975) Understanding exchange\nprocess.\nPeter, Olson (1994) Understanding consumer\nbehaviour.\nKohli, Jaworski (1990) Market orientation.\nNarver, Slater (1990) Market orientation.\nHunt (1992) Marketing as understanding\nexchange relationships.\nDay (1994; 1998; 1999a;\n1999b)\nMarket driven organisation.\nHoffman, Novak (1996;\n1997; 1999; Hoffman\nand Novak, 1997)\nUnderstanding consumer\nbehaviour online.\nOne-to-one \/\nRelationship\nMarketing\nBerry, Pasasuraman et\nal (1985; 1991)\nRelationship marketing, quality\nin context of service marketing.\nChristopher, Payne\n(1991; 1995)\nIntegration of marketing,\nservice and quality.\nCraven, Piercy (1994) Relationship marketing\ncapabilities.\n(Peppers and Rogers,\n1994; Pine, Peppers et\nal, 1995; Peppers and\nRogers, 1997)\nCustomer loyalty.\nBerry (1995) Multiple levels of relationship\nmarketing, role of internal\nmarketing and trust.\nHallberg (1995) Customer loyalty.\nReichheld (1996) Consumer, employee and\ninvestor loyalty.\nNetwork\nMarketing\nGummesson (1987;\n1998; 2000)\nNetwork\/interactive model and\nimplementing relationship\nmarketing.\nCoviello et al (2002) Marketing practices; comparing\ntransaction to relationship\nmostly, some comparison to\nnetwork marketing.\nAchrol, Kotler (1999) Identifies prototypical marketing\nstructures for network\nmarketing.\n31\nAppendix 2: The Workshop tools\nFigure 2 describes a process of iterative workshops that build managers\u2019\nappreciation for their Dynamic Capabilities. The capabilities framework and\nthe literature (Appendix 1) that underpins it were translated into workshop\ntools facilitating this process, thus grounding the outcome of the enquiries in\nmarketing theory.\nThere are template tools for each of the four Dynamic Capabilities in\nmarketing which are then customised further as the managers go through the\nprocess. It is important that marketing managers adopt these tools as their\nown and see them as useful to improving their practice. Below is an example\nof the template tool for assessing CRM capabilities. It provides a score\nbetween one and three for each capability; managers generally wish to use\nfractions, such as 2.3 or 1.5, to promote a sufficiently nuanced discussion of\nDynamic Capabilities.\n\u2022Product\/Product group\n\u2022Profit centres with product\nmanagement\n\u2022Marketing plan focused on\nproducts and services\n\u2022Marketing translates\nconsumer needs into\ndevelopment briefs\n\u2022Client managers or customer\nsegment\n\u2022Profit centres aligned to\ncustomers\n\u2022Customer development plans\n\u2022Customers teach the firm,\nclient managers lead response,\ncapture learning and\ndisseminate\n\u2022Community managers\n\u2022Profit centre model as\nyet undetermined\n\u2022Breadth and depth of\ncommunity needs served\n\u2022The firm makes its\nresources available to\ncommunities that drive\ninnovation\nTransactional\nrelationship\n(Score =1)\nOne-to-one\nrelationship\n(Score =2)\nNetworked\nrelationship\n(Score =3)\nMeasures of CRM\nCustomer\nGovernance\nBusiness\nDevelopment\nFocus\nProduct \/Service\nDevelopment\nProcess\nScore\nOverall score\nCRM Scoring Tool Used for Car-Co\u2019s Initial Evaluation of Current Capabilities\n32\nThe assessment tool is calibrated for each of the four marketing Dynamic\nCapabilities to provide managers with an assessment of their current\nsituation. The tools are calibrated over a number of workshops, interspersed\nwith individual action-and-learning about relevant subjects, such as new\ncustomer service models, competitors, customer behaviour, marketing\ncapabilities and resources. Managers prepare the results of their\ninvestigations for subsequent workshops where ideas are challenged\nvigorously and developed collaboratively.\nInitially, the tools are used to identify current Dynamic Capabilities. Managers\nposition each component of their marketing capabilities against the profile of\ntheir current marketing strategy: transaction, one-to-one relationship and\nnetwork marketing. Managers then identify the key marketing resources\nassociated with these Dynamic Capabilities; as resources and capabilities are\nhighly interdependent, the identification of resources flows easily from the\nworkshops. Then, they consider the CRM strategies that they wish to\nimplement and determine the future resources required, paying particular\nattention to their most important current resources. This establishes a gap\nbetween current and future resources which can be closed by the\ndevelopment of future Dynamic Capabilities. Using the marketing capabilities\nframework, future capabilities are identified and agreement reached as to how\nthey would be built.\n33\nBibliography\n1. Achrol, R. and Kotler, P.

Planners identify drivers of\ndiscontinuous change, in this example online distribution, and build business models for\nradically different futures. These sketches of alternative futures enable managers to assess\nthe implications of key drivers for change and make contingency plans against their potential\noccurrence better.\n6 An option is the right (not the obligation) to buy or sell an underlying asset, traditionally a\nfinancial asset, at some future time. Real Options are so called because the underlying asset\nis real, not financial.\n"}
