This study provides the first\nwell-resolved observations of such flows induced by soil moisture from recent rainfall,\nand is based on aircraft data in the Sahel. Satellite imagery was used to identify fine scale\nsoil moisture features within a wet zone spanning 160 km. Above the wet soil, the20\nplanetary boundary layer was up to 3 K cooler, 3 gkg-1 moister and extended to only half\nthe depth of nearby drier areas. Mesoscale perturbations to the background flow were\nfound, consistent with low level divergence over wet soil and convergence in drier areas.\nThe soil moisture and atmospheric wind patterns were statistically coherent on\nwavelengths down to 20km. These results suggest that mesoscale convergence lines25\nforced by soil moisture may play a significant role in the meteorology of the Sahel.\n1. Introduction\nThe impact on the planetary boundary layer (PBL) of mesoscale variations in\nsurface properties such as vegetation cover and soil moisture has been a subject of30\nresearch for over two decades (e.g. Ookouchi et al., 1984, Mahfouf et al., 1987). There\nhave been many modelling studies which have shown that surface heterogeneity can\ngenerate sea-breeze-like circulations (see a summary by Segal and Arritt, 1992 of such\nNon-classical Mesoscale Circulations, or NCMCs). Numerical and theoretical studies\nindicate a strong sensitivity of the mesoscale flow to the background wind conditions, as35\nwell as the amplitude and the length scale of the surface heat flux contrast. The role of the\ncirculations in initiating moist convection has also been studied (e.g. Chen and Avissar,\n1994, Weaver, 2004, Cheng and Cotton, 2004)\nThere has been relatively little observational evidence to support the modelling\nstudies, leading some (e.g. Shaw and Doran, 2001) to question the importance of surface-40\nforced circulations in overall land-atmosphere interaction. Examples of observed\ncirculationsinclude the impact of irrigated areas (Mahrt et al., 1994) and snow cover\n(Segal et al., 1991, Taylor et al., 1998). There has been no compelling observational\nevidence of flows induced by soil moisture from antecedent rainfall, yet the dynamical\nnature of this forcing would represent an important \u201cinternal\u201d climatic feedback on time\nscales of days to weeks.5\nThe Sahel is a region of the world where intense convective rain events generate\nmarked spatial and temporal variability in near surface soil moisture. The surface energy\nbalance here is influenced strongly by surface moisture via high rates of evaporation\ndirectly from the soil in the first few days after rain. Observations from the JET2000\naircraft campaign indicated how soil moisture patterns affected temperature and humidity10\nin the PBL (Taylor et al., 2003). The JET2000 flight had not targeted soil moisture\nvariability explicitly, and it was not possible to isolate any dynamical response to the soil\nmoisture in that case. During the Special Observing Period of the African Monsoon\nMultidisciplinary Analyses study (AMMA; Redelsperger et al., 2006), soil moisture\nfeatures were deliberately targeted by the BAe 146 operated by the U.K. Facility for15\nAirborne Atmospheric Measurements. One of the aims of these flights was to establish\nwhether the soil moisture (and associated heating) gradients were strong enough to\ninduce atmospheric circulations in a given background flow. This study presents the first\nresults from that campaign, and these strongly support the hypothesis.\n2. Data and Conditions on 1 August 200620\nDuring the observational campaign, land surface temperature (LST) data\nproduced operationally by the LandSAF from SEVIRI observations onboard the MSG\nsatellite (Wan and Dozier, 1996) were used to locate strong gradients in soil moisture.\nThe use of thermal satellite data to infer soil moisture status is well-established (e.g.\nWetzel et al., 1984) and was found to be effective in locating recent storms in the25\nJET2000 experiment (Taylor et al., 2003). Additional cloud screening was applied to the\nLandSAF data based on the time evolution of the thermal and visible channels, following\nTaylor et al. (2003). This process reduced greatly the contamination of the land surface\nsignal by cloudy and dusty pixels which were not flagged by the Eumetsat operational\nscreen. For each pixel the impact of transient wet soil conditions on LST was separated30\nfrom more permanent factors such as land cover by computing the LST anomaly (LSTA)\nfrom the 21-day running mean for the corresponding time of day. Recently wetted pixels\nare typically cooler than the longer-term mean. Finally, LSTA data from every 15 minute\nslot between 0700 and 1700 (local time) were averaged to produce a daily LSTA\nsummary. The data were invaluable for flight planning, enabling paths to be designed35\nover fresh soil moisture features once the sun had come up, in the absence of clouds. The\ndata provided a qualitative measure of soil moisture, and in particular, distinguished\nbetween dry and recently wetted surfaces.\nThis case study concerns a flight on 1 August 2006 undertaken to the north-west\nof Niamey (13.5 \u00baN, 2.3 \u00baE) in Niger and into Mali (see Figure 1), covering a straight40\ntrack of 470 km. Whilst the region directly to the north of Niamey was undergoing a dry\nspell, there had been a series of storms in the preceding days north of around 15 \u00baN,\nincluding a major storm which initiated during the previous afternoon close to 16 \u00baN, 1\n\u00baE. This major convective system subsequently travelled across Mali, leaving a swath of\nwet soil several hundred kilometres across and over 1000 km long. Within this large-45\nscalestorm path, many fine scale cool (wet) surface features are evident in Figure 1b,\nconsistent with the convection which was tracked from thermal imagery during the storm.\nThe aim of the flight was to sample the PBL above the contrasting soil moisture\nconditions near the north-eastern end of the track of this storm. The flight took place\nduring the early afternoon, when any daytime dynamical response to the surface would be5\nmaximised, while the bulk properties of the boundary layer were varying relatively\nslowly with time. The flight consisted of a leg at minimum safe altitude (170 m above\nground level, 13:06 to 14:12 UTC) headed approximately north-west across the soil\nmoisture pattern into Mali from Niger. This was followed by a return leg at an altitude of\n7000 m (14:35 to 15:29 UTC) from which dropsondes were launched. The first leg10\nprovided high spatial resolution temperature, humidity and wind data whilst the second\ngave an indication of the vertical structure of the atmosphere at reduced horizontal\nresolution. The terrain on the flight track was rather flat. North of 15.0 \u00baN, topographic\nheight varied by up to 30m around a mean of 300m, whilst further south, the aircraft\ncrossed larger valleys of up to 60 m depth. The vegetation was generally very sparse,15\nwith a seasonal herbaceous layer just starting to emerge between woody coverage of a\nfew percent.\nThe synoptic conditions during the flight were dominated by an African Easterly\nWave. A trough had passed over the region the previous day, and the low level flow on 1\nAugust was south-westerly, as depicted by the European Centre for Medium Range20\nWeather Forecasts (ECMWF) analysis at 925 hPa (Figure 1a). During the low level\nflight, the track was predominantly cloud-free north of 15.0 \u00baN. The PBL became\nmarkedly dustier north of 16.7 \u00baN, and this may have affected the quality of the LSTA\nand onboard radiometer data in the north of the transect.\nData from the aircraft used here included temperature, humidity and 3-25\ndimensional wind observations, all recorded at 32 Hz (http:\/\/www.faam.ac.uk\/). In\naddition to calculating mean dynamic and thermodynamic variables from these sensors,\nan estimate of sensible heat flux at the level of the flight was computed based on the\ncovariance of the temperature and the vertical velocity about 30 second running means\n(approximately 3 km). A Heimann radiometer was used to identify variations in land30\nsurface temperature directly beneath the aircraft. Finally, an Airborne Vertical\nAtmospheric Profiling System comprising Vaisala RD93 dropsondes was deployed.\n3. Variability at the Surface and in the Planetary Boundary Layer\nA qualitative assessment of the rainfall history along the flight track was\ndeveloped based on LSTA data (spatial pattern) and cold cloud imagery (timing of the35\nstorms that wetted the surface). The 2-dimensional structure of the wet features on or near\nthe track (Figure 1b) could be associated with convective-scale structure in the earlier\nevolution of the cold cloud. For clarity, we defined 6 wet surface patches based on\ngradients in LSTA along the flight track (Figure 2). Soil moisture from the storm on 31\nJuly produced strong surface cooling beneath the flight track between 16.1 and 16.45 \u00baN40\n(patch 5), and again around 16.6 \u00baN (patch 6). Distinct soil moisture features remained\nfrom storms on 30 July between 15.5 and 16.1 \u00baN (patches 2, 3 and 4), although these\nzones were far from uniformly wet. For example, patch 4 (due to an event on 30 July)\nwas as marked in terms of LSTA as that produced by the storm on the previous afternoon\n(negative anomalies exceeding 7 \u00baC), whilst patches 2 and 3 were relatively dry. A weak45\nLSTApattern was also identified further south (patch 1) associated with a storm 4 days\nearlier. Finally, north of patch 6, rain events on 30 July had produced widespread\nnegative LSTAs. By the time of the flight (2 days later), these features were rather weak\nand not so well-defined in space.\nFigure 2 presents a series of datasets plotted as a function of latitude along the 4705\nkm track. Figure 2a demonstrates the impact of near surface moisture (as detected\nthrough LSTA) on the surface energy balance. Variations in surface temperature recorded\nby the aircraft radiometer were generally well correlated with LSTA. Similarly, a positive\ncorrelation was evident between turbulent heat flux and LSTA. These relationships were\nweaker in the drier zones at either end of the transect, with the clearest example of cooler10\nsurface temperatures and reduced heat fluxes (in the absence of near surface moisture)\nbeing between 14.6 and 14.9 \u00baN. This was a relatively well-vegetated valley where\nevaporation could be maintained in spite of a lack of recent rain via transpiration from the\nroot zone. Furthermore, downwelling surface radiation was reduced in this region due to\ncloud.15\nThe spatial pattern of heating along the track produced a clear response to surface\nwetness in the PBL potential temperature (Figure 2b). Compared to the large scale\ntemperature trend (illustrated by the midday ECMWF analysis at 1\u00ba resolution), the PBL\nwas observed to be up to 3K cooler in the wet zone compared to adjacent drier zones.\nThis atmospheric response was qualitatively similar to previous observations (Taylor et20\nal., 2003), but the amplitude of temperature variations was 2K stronger in this case. The\nsurface wetness also induced substantial variations in PBL humidity, notably in the\npositive local anomalies of around 3-4 gkg-1 where the previous day\u2019s storm occurred.\nIn Figure 2c, the impact of surface-induced PBL gradients on the wind is shown.\nThere was a strong positive correlation between the along-track gradient in virtual25\npotential temperature and the wind component in that direction. As discussed above,\nthese PBL gradients were linked to gradients in LSTA. Thus, in the storm-affected central\nzone, local minima in (roughly) south-easterly wind speed occurred at 15.48, 15.75,\n15.91 and 16.50 \u00baN, to the south-east of patches 2, 3, 4 and 6, with wind anomalies of\naround 1-2 ms-1. Conversely, there was a tendency for local maxima in along-track wind30\nto occur close to where the aircraft flew from a wet to a dry surface. Thus zones of\nhorizontal divergence were located approximately over the wet patches, consistent with\nearlier studies (e.g. Ookouchi et al., 1984). A further divergent flow was identified over\nthe cool, well-vegetated patch (14.6-14.9 \u00baN) within the dry soil region. Taking values for\nwinds over the dry slot around 16.5 \u00baN, along-track convergence reached values of 10-4 s -35\n1. Assuming a vertical length scale for such a circulation of 1.5 km implies a peak vertical\nvelocity in the middle of the PBL of the order of 7.5 cm s -1, the same order of magnitude\nas has been simulated numerically by various authors.\nGiven the fine spatial resolution of the flow (features on scales ~20 km), the\ndropsondes (spaced typically 75 km apart) could not provide a comprehensive cross-40\nsection of the mesoscale flows. However, they illustrated the vertical structure of the\nsurface-induced PBL anomalies at a number of locations on the flight track. In Figure 3,\nthe profiles at 15.0 and 16.0 \u00baN are contrasted. Above patch 4 at 16.0 \u00baN, the well-mixed\nlayer extended to 910 hPa, compared to 820 hPa over dry soil at 15.0 \u00baN. The mixed layer\nvalues of potential temperature and specific humidity were consistent with those45\nmeasured on the low level leg at 960 hPa (Figure 2b). The dropsonde wind data showed\nthesouth-westerly monsoon flow at 15 \u00baN (and also 14.6 \u00baN, not shown). At 16.0N on the\nother hand, the winds had a stronger westerly component and notably weaker southerlies\nin the PBL. Above the PBL there was a weak southerly jet at 850 hPa. The dropsonde\nwinds were consistent with the onboard low level data and indicate divergence up to 875\nhPa over the major storm track.5\n4. Spatial scale of dynamical response\nHaving aircraft measurements at high resolution allowed us to quantify the\ndependence of this response on spatial scale, using spectral analysis. Onboard estimates\nof surface temperature from the Heimann radiometer were used with in-situ10\nmeasurements of thermodynamic data and along-track winds, all averaged to 100 m along\nthe track and detrended. The spectral analysis outlined by Matthews and Madden (2000)\nhas then been applied in terms of spatial transforms, in order to quantify the spectral\ncoherency as a function of spatial scale (or wavenumber). The coherency between two\nFourier transforms is usually described as a spectral version of the correlation function,15\nand is based on the product of one spectrum with the complex conjugate of the other.\nSmoothing of this product is required, here using a running mean, in order to infer\nsignificance over a range of wavenumbers, with this range corresponding to the\nbandwidth. The result is normalised by the smoothed amplitudes of the original spectra to\ndeduce the coherency, which takes values in the range from zero to one. If a consistent20\nrelationship between the spectra exists over a range of wavenumbers, then the coherency\nwill be high.\nFigure 4 shows a plot of coherency squared for the surface temperature with,\nrespectively, along-track wind component and virtual potential temperature. The 95%\nconfidence level is plotted following Julian (1975). For low wavenumbers, Figure 425\nconfirms the conclusions which can be inferred by eye in Figure 2; that there is strong\ncoherency between surface temperature and both wind and temperature in the PBL.\nFurthermore, from Figure 4 we can state that in this case the coupling between winds and\nsurface temperatures was significant on wavelengths down to 20 km (wavenumber 0.05\nc\/km), equivalent to adjacent wet and dry patches of 10 km scale. Coupling of surface30\nand PBL temperatures was significant on smaller scales, arguably down to 5 km\nwavelength. The scale of mixing by large boundary layer eddies is on the scale of the\nPBL depth \u2013 around 1km \u2013 and therefore the loss of coherency between atmospheric and\nsurface temperature details below 5 km is not unexpected. Note that the coherency\nbetween the across-track component of the wind and the surface temperature is not35\nstatistically significant at the 95% level in these data. These results appear to be robust, in\nthat they are not sensitive to reasonable changes in the spectral bandwidth.\nThe phase function (inset, Figure 4) confirmed that the convergence of warm air\noccurred over the warmer surfaces (phase of around 90\u00ba) at wavelengths down to 40 km.\nHowever, at shorter surface length scales, the phase increased, so that at a wavelength of40\n20 km, the wind and surface temperature patterns were almost in anti-phase (150\ndegrees). This implies that convergence was maximised to the south-east of a given warm\nsurface anomaly; a feature which may be inferred by eye from Figure 2c. The gain\nfunction \u2013 the amplitude of the atmospheric response to a given amplitude of surface\ntemperature showed that the gain of the convergent response along the track was not45\nsignificantlysensitive to length scale, and, consistently, that gain in along-track winds\nincreased with horizontal scale (inset Figure 4), having values consistent with those\ndescribed in section 3.\n5. Discussion\nThis study has shown for the first time from observations that rainfall can5\ngenerate sufficient spatial variability in soil moisture and heat flux to affect the low level\nwind field on scales of 10 km upwards. The satellite data in Figure 1a indicate that the\nsoil beneath the 31 July storm path was rather wetter further downstream, where the\nsystem had matured into a major mesoscale convective system, than in the location of the\nflight. This suggests that PBL temperature gradients and associated convergence features10\nmay have been even stronger to the south-west than were observed here. On 1 August\n2006, there were 3 major soil moisture features from storm tracks across the Sahel\n(Figure 1a). The occurrence of such soil moisture forcing during the wet season should\ntherefore perhaps be regarded as the norm, and the occurrence of surface-induced\nmesoscale circulations as daily events. The Sahel provides very favourable conditions for15\nmoisture-induced circulations to develop. In regions with denser vegetation, where\nsurface fluxes are influenced more by root zone soil moisture accumulated over many\nrain events, spatial variability will tend to be weaker, and circulations less likely.\nThe strength of the response and the lack of distortion by the large-scale flow in\nthis case were presumably linked with the approximate alignment of the background20\nwind with the principal wet feature, both approximately south-westerly, and the choice of\na flight path roughly perpendicular to this axis. Analysis of additional flights during the\nAMMA campaign under contrasting atmospheric conditions will shed further light on this\nissue. They may also provide evidence for nocturnal amplification of surface-induced\ncirculations, as proposed by Parker et al. (2005).25\nWork is needed to quantify the surface flux patterns associated with soil moisture\nvariability, based on land surface models forced by the best available meteorological\nforcing (notably rainfall). This will provide an opportunity to test both theoretical and\nnumerical models of NCMCs. Finally, it is important to use observations from AMMA to\nexamine whether these circulations play a direct role in triggering moist convection. The30\nrecent observational study by Taylor and Ellis (2006) identified that afternoon convection\nin this region is modulated by soil moisture, with strong suppression of initiation over wet\nsoils. This modulation is consistent with NCMC forcing.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to warmly thank all those involved in the Niger deployment of the FAAM35\naircraft, the staff at LandSAF for providing land surface temperature data, and Adrian\nMatthews for assistance with flight planning and statistical analysis.

(a) Surface soil moisture\n[m3\/m3] across West Africa produced from AMSR-E data by NASA (Njoku, 2004).\nWhen data are available from two overpasses on 1 August, the mean value is shown. The\nedges of the early afternoon swaths are marked with dashed lines, and overpass times\n(UTC) are marked at the top. Note that the storm which initiated close to the flight track\nwas not detected west of 6 \u00baW as it had not reached this region by the overpass time\n(02:30 1 August). Also shown are the wind vectors at 925 hPa from the midday ECMWF\noperational analysis. The dashed rectangle shows the domain of Figure 1b. (b) Daily land\nsurface temperature anomaly summary in the region of the flight (shading). The dashed\ncontours at -60, -70 and -80 \u00baC indicate the minimum temperatures measured by MSG\nduring the storm of the previous day (1400 \u2013 2400 UTC). The locations of dropsonde\ndescents are shown by triangles.\nFigure2. Aircraft data from the low level transect. Satellite-derived land surface\ntemperature anomaly (LSTA; grey shading) is shown in Figures 2a and 2b. (a): Surface\ntemperature from the onboard radiometer (solid line) and turbulent heat flux (squares).\n(b): Potential temperature (solid) and humidity mixing ratio (squares), and potential\ntemperature at 925hPa in the midday ECMWF analysis (dashed). (c): Along-track\ncomponent of the wind (solid) and gradient in virtual potential temperature (dashed). The\nsolid black rectangles denote wet patches identified using gradients of LSTA.\nFigure3.
