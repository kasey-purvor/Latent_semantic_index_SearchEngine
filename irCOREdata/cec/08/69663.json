Introduction\nAnalysis of time series is crucial to the understanding of complex sys-\ntems and how they work. The existence of complexity implies that\nseveral different processes are present in the system\u2019s dynamics. Often,\ntime series of two or more different variables can be measured. An ap-\npropriately chosen form of time series analysis may be able to establish\nthe interrelationships, if any, between the time series and thus yield\ninformation relevant to the underlying processes that generate them.\nThe analysis of multivariate data of this kind has recently attracted\nmuch attention, including applications such as synchronization analysis\n(Pikovsky et al., 2001) and the detection of coupling direction (Rosen-\nblum et al., 2002; Palus\u02c7 and Stefanovska, 2003). The methods suggested\nby these authors require, however, that distinct oscillatory modes are\npresent and that they can be unambiguously distinguished in the time\nseries under study.\nUnfortunately this is not always so. For example, although it was\nsuggested that the dynamics of cardiovascular signals can be described\nc\u00a9 2015 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.\nT_paper.tex; 16\/04\/2015; 16:47; p.1\nPublished in Cardiovasc. Engin. 4, 89-93 (2004).\n2 Bandrivskyy et al\nas a few oscillatory modes (Stefanovska et al., 2001), not all the modes\ncan be measured independently. In addition, partly on account of the\nfinite time of observation, the low frequencies modes cannot easily be\ndecomposed or separated from the noisy background. Additional com-\nplications are that signals from complex systems often involve modes at\nseveral frequencies and that the latter may themselves be time-variable.\nThe cross-spectrum can be used to detect whether two processes\ninvolve oscillations within the same frequency region. However, the lim-\nitation of this technique lies in its inability to distinguish whether the\noscillations at a given frequency are independent or mutually related. A\ndifferent approach is therefore required, able to detect phase coherence\nin different frequency regions of two given signals. We use the term\nphase coherence here in the generalised sense that a phase difference\nbetween two oscillations is allowed provided that it remains constant\nthroughout the whole time of observation.\nIn what follows, we apply a wavelet-based technique to detect phase\ncoherence, enabling us to introduce a technique for studying interac-\ntions between skin blood flow and temperature regulatory mechanisms\n(Johnson et al., 1986; Shusterman et al., 1997; Nuzzaci et al., 1999).\n2. Methods\n2.1. Measurements\nSimultaneous measurements were made of skin temperature and blood\nflow for 10 healthy subjects, 7 male and 3 female, aged between 24\nand 62 years (median age 30), as follows. The subject relaxed supine\non a bed for 15 minutes. A temperature sensor (Thermilinearr, YSI\nIncorporated, Ohio, USA) connected to a signal conditioning unit (Car-\ndiosignals, Joz\u02c7ef Stefan Institute, Slovenia) and a laser-Doppler blood\nflow sensor (DP1T-V2 probe connected to DRT4, Moor Instruments,\nAxminster, Devon, UK) were placed together on the volar aspect of\nthe forearm, positioned so as to avoid large blood vessels or blemishes,\nheld in position with a double-sided adhesive annulus.\nFor a continuous period of 80 minutes, temperature and blood flow\ndata were digitized (16-bit at a sampling frequency of 400 Hz) and\nrecorded. After 30 minutes of basal recording, a thermal shock was\nused to enhance oscillatory activity at the characteristic frequencies\nassociated with temperature regulation: an ice-pack was applied to\nthe measurement area and its immediate vicinity, through a layer of\nfabric to lessen the thermal shock. After 20 minutes, the ice-pack was\nremoved, while the recording was continued for another 30 minutes.\nT_paper.tex; 16\/04\/2015; 16:47; p.2\nSkin temperature and blood flow coherence 3\n28\n30\n32\n34\na )\nte\nm\np \n(\u00b0C\n)\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.01\n0    \n0.01\n0.02 b )\n0   20 40 60 80\n4\n8\n12\ntime (min)\nbl\noo\nd \nflo\nw\n (A\nU)\nc )\nte\nm\np \n(\u00b0C\n)\nFigure 1.

A typical set of\ndata, measured in this way for one subject, is shown in Fig. 1.\n2.2. Generalized phase coherence\nTo provide for time-frequency analysis of these bivariate data, we have\ndeveloped a technique that makes use of the wavelet transform. It is\nbased on the idea that the way of the splitting of the time interval T\n(the whole length of time series) should be different for different basic\nfrequencies \u03c9k, and that the scaling of \u03c9k should be logarithmic. The\ncontinuous wavelet transform is defined as\nX(\u03c9, t) =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03a8\u03c9,t(u)x(u)du, (1)\nwhere \u03a8\u03c9,t is a family of generally nonorthogonal basis functions. These\nare obtained by scaling and shifting the basic window function \u03c8(u) in\nthe time domain\n\u03a8\u03c9,t =\n\u221a\n\u03c9\u221a\n2\u03c0\n\u03c8(\nn \u2212 t\n2\u03c0\n\u03c9).\nDifferent window functions can be used. We have chosen the Morlet\nwavelet. Its simplified expression in the time domain is\n\u03c8(u) =\n1\n4\n\u221a\n\u03c0\ne\u2212i2piue\u2212u\n2\/2.\nT_paper.tex; 16\/04\/2015; 16:47; p.3\n4 Bandrivskyy et al\nIn numerical applications, frequency and time are restricted to dis-\ncrete values only. An approximation of the continuous wavelet trans-\nform was calculated using a discrete wavelet family. The basic frequency\nis scaled according to \u03c9k = \u03c9k\u221211.05 and the time is discretised by\ntn = n\u03c4 ; \u03c4 = 1s. The choice of the length of the window is a tradeoff\nbetween good and bad resolution in frequency and time domains. In\nour case the length of the window was determined by the amplitude\nof the window. The boundary value of the window was reached, when\nit\u2019s amplitude was smaller than 0.00001. For a discussion of wavelet\nanalysis, its application to cardiovascular signals, and optimal choice\nof parameters, see the review by Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 and Stefanovska (1998).\nThe complex spectral functionX(\u03c9k, tn)=Xk,n=ak,n+ibk,n describes\nthe spectral properties of the signal x(t) in the time-frequency domain.\nFor each time tn and frequency \u03c9k amplitude |Xk,n|=(a2k,n + b2k,n)1\/2\nand phase \u03c6k,n = arctan (bk,n\/ak,n) are evaluated. For two signals x1(t)\nand x2(t) one gets two phases \u03c61k,n and \u03c62k,n and the relative phase\ndifference \u2206\u03c6k,n = \u03c62k,n \u2212 \u03c61k,n can be computed.

If C\u03c6(\u03c9k) \u2243 0,\nthen there is no phase coherence between the signals x1(t) and x2(t) at\nthe frequency \u03c9k. The case when C\u03c6(\u03c9k) > 0 is less well defined. The\nmeaning of a nonzero phase coherence function for any given frequency\n\u03c9k depends crucially on the length T of the whole time series.

For example, in the extreme case when C\u03c6(\u03c9k) is evaluated\nfor the lowest possible frequency \u03c91 = 2\u03c0q\/T1 = 2\u03c0q\/T one gets a\ntrivial result C\u03c6(\u03c91) = 1. Thus the function C\u03c6(\u03c9k) has an uninfor-\nmative low frequency maximum, by construction. Therefore only the\npart of the coherence function for the higher frequencies (\u03c9k \u226b \u03c91) can\nbe used with confidence to evaluate the phase coherence between two\nsignals. Within this range C\u03c6(\u03c9k) = 1 would correspond to complete\ncoherence, and 1 > C\u03c6(\u03c9k) > 0 would correspond to partial coherence.\nThe lower frequency region (\u03c9k \u2265 \u03c91) can be still used in a statistical\nsense, albeit with caution, when the properties of a set of signals are\nbeing compared.\nAn example of the uninformative low frequency peak is shown in\nFig. 2 which shows the mean and standard deviation of C\u03c6(\u03c9k) for two\nuncorrelated white Gaussian noise signals: 30 pairs of noise signals,\neach 30 minutes in length, were sampled at 10 Hz, corresponding to\nthe real data as measured.\n3. Skin temperature and blood flow interactions\nFig. 3 shows the result of applying the wavelet transform to data like\nthose of Fig. 1(b) and (c). The data were first resampled to 10 Hz.\nNote that in the temperature very low frequency components dominate,\nwhile the blood flow signal contains several characteristic frequencies\nspanning the whole interval. While the frequency range of the cardiac\npulse was unaffected, the oscillatory process around 0.1 Hz, believed\nto originate from myogenic activity (Kvandal et al., 2003), decreased\nin frequency during cooling and gradually returned again towards its\nbasal value after the ice was removed. Despite the poor time resolution\nT_paper.tex; 16\/04\/2015; 16:47; p.5\n6 Bandrivskyy et al\nFigure 3. Time-frequency representation of (a) blood flow and (b) temperature\nsignals obtained by wavelet transform.\nin this low frequency range, there is clear evidence of a spectral peak\nat around 0.007 Hz that becomes intensified from about the time (30\nminutes) when the ice-pack is applied. It is seen both in blood flow and\nin temperature. Note that the (lighter shaded) peaks near 30 and 50\nminutes, affecting all frequencies, are artifacts due to the mechanical\ndisturbance; the significant feature in (a) is the lighter shaded ridge at\nabout 0.007 Hz running between \u223c30 and \u223c54 minutes.\nThe data have been subjected to statistical analyses to establish\nmore quantitatively the response to cooling. Fig. 4 shows that the tem-\nperature decreases, and increases, significantly. Blood flow is slightly\naffected by the temperature stress (the time evolution obtained for one\nsubject is shown in figure 1), but the differences are not statistically\nsignificant for the group as a whole. For the data labelled \u22c6\u22c6\u22c6, p = 0;\nand for that labelled \u22c6, p < 0.01.\nAn example of the calculated coherence function C\u03c6(\u03c9k) is plotted in\nFig. 5. It is generally higher than for uncorrelated white noise (Fig. 2),\nand there is some indication of increased coherence during cooling. To\ncheck this inference more carefully, the coherence was calculated for the\ngroup within different frequency intervals, yielding the results shown\nT_paper.tex; 16\/04\/2015; 16:47; p.6\nSkin temperature and blood flow coherence 7\n25\n28\n31\n34\n37\nav\ner\nag\ne \nte\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (\u00b0\nC)\n*** *\na )\n4 \n8 \n12\n16\nav\ner\nag\ne \nbl\noo\nd \nflo\nw\n (A\nU)\nb )before \nduring \nafter \nFigure 4.

While oscillations in the latter inter-\nval are hypothesized to originate from myogenic activity in the vessel\nwalls (Kvandal et al., 2003), the slowest oscillations have not to our\nknowledge been discussed previously.\n4. Conclusion\nWavelet-based coherence analysis has proved its worth by revealing\nthe two frequency ranges that are apparently involved in temperature\nregulation. The existence of the higher of these, near 0.1 Hz, is well-\nestablished. The lower range, around 0.007 Hz, may perhaps relate to\nbiochemical processes at the level of endothelium (Gustafsson et al.,\n1993; Kellogg et al., 2003; Kvandal et al., 2003) involved in the heat\nproduction that is increased in order to resist the reduction in temper-\nature. Further work will be needed to establish whether this is in fact\nthe case.\nAcknowledgements\nThe work was supported by the Slovenian Ministry of Education, Sci-\nence and Sport, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Coun-\ncil (UK), Leverhulme Trust, the British Council and INTAS.\nReferences\nBrac\u02c7ic\u02c7, M. and A.
