A \nmethodology based on action research is designed to compare the \u2018internalised\u2019 norms of behaviour \nwith the \u2018perceived\u2019 norms. Two different but complementary techniques are applied to a small \nsample of Polish students to investigate Polish cultural attitudes using Hofstede\u2019s dimensions. \nSignificant discrepancy is found between what people perceive and communicate in public as the \n\u2018national cultural norm\u2019, and what they have internalised as cultural attitude and norm of behaviour. \nThe findings from this exploratory research indicate that there are different levels of internalisation \nof cultural attitudes, and that respondents express different cultural values in response to different \nresearch tools.  \n \nKey words: comparative culture, cultural predispositions, transformation in Eastern Europe \n \nIntroduction: The Role Of Cultural Studies In  International Management \n \nSome of the earlier studies of culture in relation to international business operations date back to \nthe work of Kluckhohn & Strodtbeck (1961), Narain (1967), Nath (1969), Barrett and Bass \n(1970) and Davis (1971). The second wave of research and publications was marked by the work \nof Hofstede (1980), Ouchi (1981), Pascale and Athos (1981) and Trompenaars (1993). The \ngrowing interest in international and comparative management has produced a number of \nresearch perspectives that regard the \u2018cultural factor\u2019 as important.  \n \nFirst, this is the research agenda brought through social anthropology: focusing on cultural \nvalues, attitudes, structures and relationships (both at national and organisational level, within a \nsingle multinational corporation (MNC) and between companies cross-borders) - (Hofstede, \n1980, Mead, 1994). Social anthropologists also focus on language, religion, education and the \ngeneral social and political context in a country (Terpestra and David, 1991).  \n \nThe second research project is inspired by researchers in the field of international dimensions of \norganisational behaviour. They focus on issues of cross-cultural leadership, employee attitudes \nand motivation, decision making, communication barriers across cultures, interpersonal relations, \ncultural synergy, and international management careers (Ronen, 1986, Adler, 1991).  \n \nA third agenda is brought by general management and strategic management writers, discussing \nthe role of culture in shaping organisational structures of MNCs and the role of their \nheadquarters and subsidiaries (Ronen, 1986, Mead, 1994); the international human resource \nmanagement in MNCs (Deresky, 1994); and managing competition and collaboration across \nborders (Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1995).  \n \n                     \n1 In: The International Journal of Human Resource Management, Vol. 10, N. 4, August, 1999, pp. \n606-623. \n \n 2\nThe fourth agenda is driven by practitioners researching the international dynamics in \nmanagement practices. Their focus is on communication and negotiation across cultures, on \ncoping with cultural shock, on managing organisational cultures, and on training for expatriate \nmanagers (Terpestra and David, 1991, Jackson, 1993, Ferraro, 1994). \n \nThese four research agendas show the broad interdisciplinary interest in management and \norganisational culture studies. They are dominated overwhelmingly by assumptions related to \nculture - its meaning, boundaries, measurement, understanding, differentiation and convergence. \nYet the concept of culture remains one of the main research obstacles. The problem rests not \nonly with the definition of the concept, but also with the biases of its measurement, interpretation \nand analysis.  \n \nThe aims of this paper are: to reassess the use of the concept culture in the international \nmanagement literature; to review the subordinate concepts of values, attitudes, beliefs, and norms \nof behaviour; to analyse critically some of the leading methodologies used for comparative \nresearch; to propose a new methodology for comparative cultural studies, and to apply this \nmethodology in a specific case.  \n \nPoland was chosen deliberately for the pilot study as the project conducted there provided an \nopportunity for an experimental use of new methods and techniques for recording cultural data. \nThe research was conducted in 1995 with a group of students on a course of business \nadministration at the Bialystok Polytechnic in Poland. As a result of this research, a profile of the \nPolish cultural attitudes is developed, which aims to give a picture of the typical cultural pre-\ndispositions, prevailing in the Polish society. \n \nOur task is not only to produce a profile of the Polish cultural attitudes, that is comparable with \nHofstede\u2019s cultural dimensions, but also to establish a new methodology for research in the \ndynamics of cultural artefacts, such as attitudes for action and societal norms of behaviour. More \nimportantly, we would like to throw some light on the transformation of the cultural attitudes in \nEastern Europe. \n \nWhile Hofstede\u2019s operationalised conceptual framework is used for our research, we apply a \nmodification of Trompenaars\u2019 methodology for collecting the data. Trompenaars\u2019 approach is \nincorporated in a methodology for action research, details of which are described further in this \npaper. \n \nThe overall aim of the paper is not to compare and contrast Hofstede vs. Trompenaars. We \nbelieve that both approaches have been criticised in the literature, and each of them has specific \nweaknesses and strengths. We would like to build on what we believe are their strengths. \n \nTheoretical Perspectives on Comparative Culture \n \nThere are three leading perspectives, according to Martin (1992), that reflect the theoretical \ndiscussions on comparative management and organisation culture. First, this is the integration \nperspective, describing cultural manifestations in organisations as self-reinforcing factors, and \nanalysing their effect on organisational behaviour. Second, this is the differentiation perspective \ndescribing the ambiguity and variation across subcultures - both at national, and organisational \nlevel. Third, this is the fragmentation perspective describing the internal dynamics of culture, and \n 3\nthe fluctuations in consensus and dissension among members (Martin, 1992). These three \nperspectives grasp hardly the variety of individual and research approaches. \n \nThe classification of another writer in this field defines two major strands of research: on the one \nhand - comparative cross-national research, and on the other - a more detailed analysis of \norganisational \/ corporate \/ management culture in particular organisations (O\u2019Reilly, 1996). \nThe first strand, according to O\u2019Reilly, within its boundaries has produced two leading \nparadigms - ideational approach, interpreting national culture as a system of individual beliefs \nand values within a given society (Hofstede, 1980, Trompenaars, 1993), and an institutional \napproach, looking at the institutions that support the configuration of traditional values and \npractices (Berger and Luckmann, 1971, Sorge and Warner, 1986). Both ideational and \ninstitutional approaches support ambitious cross-national comparisons that may form wider \nframeworks of interpretation of cultural attitudes and norms of behaviour. \n \nThe second strand of research in O\u2019Reilly\u2019s classification aims mainly at the analysis of \norganisational culture, and focuses its attention on intra-national cultural characteristics. It has its \nintellectual origins within the domain of social anthropology (Geertz, 1973) and organisational \nsociology (represented in the work of Durkheim, Weber, Argyris and Bennis, Lawrence and \nLorsch, Katz and Kahn, Pfeffer)2. The definition of the main concepts in this second strand of \nresearch suggests interest mainly in the specific manifestations of culture (values, rituals, \nsymbols, artefacts, practices), but with more details than the cross-national research of Hofstede \/ \nTrompenaars. \n \nWhat these two classifications of comparative cultural research give us, in addition to these \nmentioned in the introduction, is the assertion that the field of comparative cultural analysis is far \nfrom a state of consolidation. What is common in this variety of interpretations of culture, is the \nsubjective nature of the research, and the implicit value judgements made by the researchers. The \nsubjectivity of cultural research stems not only from the nature of the observed phenomenon, \nwhich requires in any case interpretation and labelling of the facts, but also from the very fact \nthat all of our theoretical constructions are only  an approximation to the complex socio-cultural \nworld.  \n \nKluckhohn and Strodtbeck (1961) \n \nOne of the first systematic discussions of national culture and national value orientations, and \ntheir influence on organisational systems, has been developed by Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck \n(1961). They define five common human problems to which nations collectively are searching \nfor solutions.  \n \nIn the context  of \u2018personal construct theory\u2019, these value orientations are \u2018constructs\u2019 that are \ncommonly shared within a community, and therefore resemble a pattern of expected \/ agreed \nupon \/or \u2018authorised\u2019 behaviour. \n \nAdler (1991) \n \nVery much in the same tradition, Adler (1991) defines these problems as individual \ninterpretations that exist at the level of values and attitudes, and that determine human \n                     \n2For a detailed discussion see Brown (1995). \n 4\nbehaviour. The emphasis here is on the fact that whatever different labels we use, they all mean \n\u2018common cultural pre-dispositions to behaviour\u2019. \n \nThe five problems and their alternative solutions, according to Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck (1961) \n& Adler (1991), are the following: 1: the nature of the human being (good \/ mixed \/ evil); 2: \nhuman relationship with the world (dominant \/ harmonious \/ subjunctive [or submissive]); 3: \nprimary mode of activity (doing \/ becoming [or controlling] \/ being); 4: individual relationship to \nother people (individualism \/ collaterality \/ lineality [or hierarchical groups]; 5: temporal \norientation (past \/ present \/ future); and a sixth dimension introduced by Adler (1991) 6: \nconception of space (private \/ mixed \/ public).  \n \nParsons (1951) \n \nKluckhohn and Strodtbeck and Adler are obviously influenced by Parsons\u2019 classification of \nrelationships that an individual within a society maintains with the environment: emotionally \ncharged vs. emotionally neutral; diffuse [multidimensional] vs. specific; universalistic [in terms \nof applications of the rules] vs. particularistic; ascription vs. achievement oriented; self- vs. \ncollectively oriented (Parsons, 1951).  \n \nInteresting fact is that the cultural attitudes that evolve as solutions to these relationships and \nfundamental human problems are describes in non-orderable categories. For example, \u2018good\u2019 and \n\u2018evil\u2019 (point 1. in Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck) are not direct opposites in all situations. Both could \nform different scales, could be measured by different indicators, and could co-exist as \ndispositions for an action by human beings.  \n \nThe point here is that the qualitative nature of the personal pre-dispositions enables individuals to \nmake choices that may seem incoherent to an external observer. Individuals could accommodate \ncontradictions, while construing their world, they are living in (Kelly, 1955, Burr and Butt, \n1992). This is one of the fundamental facts that corresponds with personal construct theory, and \nundermines the validity of many research methodologies used for comparative analysis of \nculture. \n \nHofstede (1980) \n \nOne of the most popular, and yet the most contradictory research, is by Hofstede (1980, 1983, \n1990). He aimed at developing \u2018a commonly acceptable, well-defined, and empirically based \nterminology to describe cultures\u2019 (Hofstede, 1983, p. 77) and, with his systematically collected \ndata across 50 countries, he achieved unmatchable simplicity and assertiveness of findings. \n \nThe main appeal of Hofstede\u2019s research is that it is based on a systematic collection of cultural \ndata. The author describes the process in the following way: \u2018the four dimensions were found \nthrough a combination of multivariate statistics (factor analysis) and theoretical reasoning\u2019 \n(Hofstede, 1983, p.78). Hofstede\u2019s factors, however, explain only 50% of the variance across \nnations.  \n \nThe four dimensions of Hofstede for evaluation of cultural dispositions are the following: \u2018power \ndistance\u2019, uncertainty avoidance\u2019, \u2018individualism \/ collectivism\u2019 and \u2018masculinity\/ femininity\u2019. \nConsequently a fifth dimension is introduced by the author - \u2018Confucian dynamism\u2019, described as \nthe maintenance of long-term orientation vs. short-term orientation (Hofstede, 1993). \n 5\n \nHofstede\u2019s theoretical reasoning is linked with Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck and starts from the \nsame assumption that nation\u2019s culture, as a collective mental programming, derives from the \nanswers to fundamental problems related to human nature and human existence, that societies, in \ntheir historical evolution, have found. \n \nTrompenaars (1993)   \n \nTrompennars has a more pragmatic view on culture. He draws upon the work by Parsons (1951), \nKluckhohn and Strodtbeck (1961), and defines the concept as the way people solve problems, \nparticularly related to relationships, time and the external environment (Trompenaars, 1993). He \nsuggests the following scales on which individual responses to problems are interpreted: \n\u2018universalism versus particularism\u2019, \u2018individualism versus collectivism\u2019, \u2018neutral (meaning \ninstrumental and achieving objectives) versus emotional\u2019 (meaning being personally involved in \nthe choices and the solutions), \u2018inner-directed (through personal judgements, commitments and \ndecisions as guides to action) versus outer-directed (driven by signals, demands and trends in the \noutside world)\u2019, \u2018specific (meaning a prescribed relationship through a technical contract) versus \ndiffuse (relationship based on understanding and trust)\u2019, \u2018analysing (or fragmenting the issues) \nversus integrating \/ synthesising (as an approach to problems)\u2019, \u2018achieved status (when status is \nacquired through recent accomplishments) versus ascribed status (when status is attributed by \nbirth, kinship, age, gender or social network)\u2019, \u2019equality versus hierarchy (the way one treats \nothers)\u2019, \u2018attitudes to time\u2019 (when values lay in the past or in the future and the time is perceives \nas a linear function, vs. as a repetitive cycles), \u2018attitudes to environment\u2019 (individual versus \nnature determinism) (Trompenaars, 1993, Hampden-Turner and Trompenaars, 1993).  \n \nMost of these scales originate in previous research and the authors themselves have rejected \nsome of them as vague and ambiguous for an empirical study (Hampden-Turner and \nTrompenaars, 1993). However, Trompenaars\u2019s acceptance of the constructivist methodology, \nthat individuals make choices through alternative (or bipolar) constructs, is in accordance with \nour interpretation of the cultural predispositions. \n \nTrompenaars\u2019s and Hampden-Turner\u2019s research approach to expose respondents to situations \nwith irreconcilable alternative solutions, matched very well with our belief that dispositions to \nactions and are revealed through individual choices, rather than through verbal accounts in a \nquestionnaire. This was the main principle that we adopted in the design of our research \nmethodology. \n \nReturning back to Hofstede, some of the discrepancies in his approach are the assumptions he \nmakes of a correspondence between national territory, national culture and organisational \nculture. His findings are based upon a sample, where the respondents have been clearly \ninfluenced by the management of a particular multinational company, and in a specific industry \n(Jaeger, 1986 and Mead, 1993). This means that the attitudes of the surveyed individuals could \nbe responses to the specific mixture of national and international factors, or could vary across \norganisations within one national culture.  \n \nIn a most recent comparative research of organisational culture Hofstede himself distinguishes \nbetween three levels of cultural manifestations - national level, dominated by the values \ninternalised through the family institution; occupational level, dominated by internalised values \nand adopted practices within the educational system; and organisational level, dominated by \n 6\nlearned and adopted practices at the workplace (Hofstede, 1990). This innovation in Hofstede\u2019s \nown work raises another fundamental question - how relevant are his previous findings and to \nwhat extent they represent a national norm of beliefs and behaviour, or rather an occupational, or \nan organisational one.  \n \nIn spite of the criticisms of Hofstede\u2019s work, Mead states that, with its simplicity and well \nstructured approach, the model promises to be the major influence in comparative cultural \nstudies for a long time to come (Mead, 1993). The level of operationalisation of the selected by \nHofstede dimensions, was one of the most attractive features that determined our choice for \ndescriminates of the cultural attitudes with our Polish sample.  \n \nPersonal Attitudes, Values and Norms as Cultural Predispositions to Behaviour \n \nIn addition to the problem of appropriate conceptual framework for the comparative analysis of \nnational cultures, there is another fundamental question - what is the object of measurement - \nrelationships, cultural artefacts, or predispositions to behaviour. In the following part we review \nthe key issues in that area, and introduce the hypothesis for our research. \n \nInternalised vs. perceived societal norm of behaviour \n \nIn one of his earlier publications Hofstede raised the methodological question about \ndistinguishing between \u2018desired\u2019 and \u2018desirable\u2019. However, he does not suggest a solution to this \nparadox. When individuals give an answer to a question - do they refer to their own perspective \nor view (desired), or to what they perceive is expected from them (desirable), or to what other \npeople would say (desirable as well)? The implications are that empirical research of cultural \npredispositions, based on opinions of \u2018what is important\u2019, and \u2018how important it is\u2019 are more \nlikely to reflect on the category \u2018desirable\u2019, rather than \u2018desired\u2019. Therefore, the answers of the \nrespondents to questions of Hofstede\u2019s type will measure what is perceived as important, rather \nthan what is internalised as important. \n \nThe distinction that we make here is related to the level of self-awareness, rather than the \nseparation of the private and the public domains. According to the principles of the personal \nconstruct theory, the two domains are inseparable (Kelly, 1955, Burr and Butt, 1992). However, \nthrough a public discourse of cultural norms, the individuals become more aware of their own \nbehavioural predispositions, and what is expected from them in a particular social context. \n \nThe constructs that are developed under the influence of a particular socio-cultural environment, \nand that are fully integrated into the entire range of behavioural options, hold by the individual, \nwe call internalised norms of behaviour. This means, in social psychological terms, that the \nindividuals have fully accepted a particular mode of behaviour as the most appropriate in given \nsituations. These internalised modes of behaviour could be triggered almost automatically in \nsituations, without the individuals being particularly aware of the reasons for their behaviour. \n \nOn the contrary, there are constructs that are in the public discourse and individuals are aware of \nthem. Individuals may have internalised them, or may still question them (Kelly, 1955, Burr, \n1992). However, the individuals in their attempts to identify themselves with a particular social \ngroup (or a nation) will refer to these constructs and will be more willing to articulate them in the \npublic discourse. \n \n 7\nThis formed our first hypothesis, that there are at least two representations of cultural attitudes \n(or mental programmes)3 - what individuals perceive as a societal norm of behaviour, and \nwhat the majority of individuals have internalised as their own cultural norm.4 \n \nNational values, attitudes and cultural norms of behaviour \n \nOne of the evident contradictions in Hofstede\u2019s work is contained in the definition of what \nactually he has measured with his 116,000 questionnaires? Hofstede claims that he has measured \n\u2018values\u2019 (as people\u2019s desires, preferences and choices) rather than \u2018attitudes\u2019 (as people\u2019s \nperceptions) (Hofstede, 1983, p. 77). Yet, his work is most often quoted as \u2018a measurement of \nwork-related attitudes across a range of cultures\u2019 (Mead, 1990, p. 17), and an explanation \u2018of the \ndifferences in work-related values and attitudes\u2019 (Adler, 1991, p.46).  \n \nIn relation to Hofstede\u2019s findings, Adler has difficulties to differentiate between values and \nattitudes. At the same time she distinguishes between \u2018values\u2019 - as the general beliefs and \npreferences on one hand, and \u2018attitudes\u2019 - as the personality constructs which dispose a person to \nact or react to a certain motive, on the other hand.  \n \nWe have to stress that this is a misleading conceptualisation of the terms \u2018values\u2019 and \u2018attitudes\u2019. \nFirst of all, these concepts (values, beliefs, preferences, choices, attitudes, norms) are all personal \nconstructs that enable the individuals to make sense of their cultural environment, and to act \naccording to the circumstances and the projected expectations of the \u2018others\u2019. From the \nperspective of personal construct theory, these concepts contain both the predispositions for \nbehaviour and the actual behaviour (Kelly, 1955, Burr and Butt, 1992). If we accept this basic \nprinciple, the individual response\/behaviour and the social environment, in which this response \ntakes place, are inseparable.  \n \nReturning back to Adler\u2019s work, there is no doubt for her that the individual responses to a \nproblem (or the societal \u2018solutions\u2019 mentioned above) form ordinal scales, which researchers \ncould use to make value judgements about a particular national culture. These judgements are \nmade according to what the respondents think is typical for a nation. A classification of cultures \ntherefore appear to be a classification of  typical forms of behaviour, or typical predispositions \nfor an action, expressed by the majority of the members of a culturally coherent group. \n \nOur concern in this paper is primarily with the national cultural norms that affect the economic \nbehaviour of the individuals, and are perceived by these individuals as typical for the nation. Our \ndefinition of the concept \u2018national culture\u2019 overlaps with the pragmatic description by Clark, et. \nal. (1997) - \u201cnational culture ... refers to the shared attitudes, values and understandings in a \nsociety which are shaped by common experiences, and result in collective mental programmes\u201d \n(Clark, et. al., 1997, p. 350).  \n \nThis definition refers to \u2018mental programmes\u2019 as the artefacts of the process of socialisation that \ndetermine individual and collective actions. These mental programmes are treated as individual \npredispositions to behaviour. Research on these \u2018mental programmes\u2019 (or both the perceived and \n                     \n3In this paper the concepts of dispositions, attitudes, or mental programmes are used as carrying the same meaning. \n4Our argument is that people communicate in public and share their perceptions of the societal norm. Therefore, \nthe perceived societal norm is what individuals think other people  from their nationality  believe in, and what they \nknow is expected from them by the public. \n 8\ninternalised norms of behaviour), will have to focus not on individual opinions, but on individual \nchoices and their most plausible decisions for an action from their own perspective. \n \nThese individual response to a problem situation will be based on a temporal assessment of the \nsituation, and a personal judgement with regard to what might be evaluated as the most \nappropriate action. In this context, a group\/collective\/national response will be based on an \nassessment and a decision for an action, driven by norms of behaviour that are either widely \ncommunicated and shared within that group, or internalised by the majority of its members.  \n \nIt is expected that the group awareness of the cultural norm will have a direct impact on the \n\u2018choices\u2019 of each member of that group, and that the publicly communicated norm will differ by \norientation and strength from the internalised norm. This formed our second hypothesis, that \nthere will be a significant difference between the perceived cultural norm of behaviour \n(articulated in open public discourse) and the individual internalised norm of behaviour, \nassessed through test methodologies. \n \nIn different situations individuals are expected to resort to different norms in making their \nassessment of the situations they face, and in making judgements of what is an appropriate \naction. Our third hypothesis in this respect is that the internalised norm will represent more \nstable cultural configurations, while the perceived norm will be more dynamic and open for \nchanges and manipulation (for example, by the media, by the political environment, and by \ntemporary changes in the society). \n \nWe need to bear in mind that individuals can make different choices if they refer to different \nnorms - societal, occupational, or organisational norm of behaviour. If we want to assess the \nnational culture, we need to ask the individuals to refer to what they perceive as a \u2018societal\u2019 \nnorm, or value. Therefore, we measure the individual\u2019s perception of the societal norm \/ value, in \nspite of the extent to which this norm is internalised and has affected the behaviour of this \nparticular individual.  \n \nIn this respect the method of action research was chosen as the most appropriate, as it involves \ndirect participation of both researcher and respondents in a detailed discussion of the theoretical \nconcepts, the research context, the instrument of observation, and the alternative choices \navailable to the respondents, their meaning and implications both for the learning and the \nresearch processes. Our project was designed  as an exploratory study, and the main objectives \nwere to test the first two hypothesis defined in this sections.  \n  \nResearch Methodology \n \nIt is obvious from a methodological point of view that a comparative research focused on \nindividual behaviour will require a fundamentally different approach. It has to look at the process \nof interaction between the individuals and the environment, shaped by the cultural \npredispositions of these individuals. It also requires that the respondents are completely aware of \nall alternative choices they have as options, and the way their choices will be assessed and \ninterpreted.  \n \nTrompenaars proposes a partial solution to the problem of studying predispositions to behaviour \nvery much in accordance with the personal construct theory, by exposing his respondents to a \ndecision situation when they have to make choices between irreconcilable alternatives. \n 9\nTrompenaars himself does not pretend to develop a scientific approach and to apply  a vigorous \nmethodology. His scales, however, are built around some of the dichotomies listed above, and \nmeasure the general orientation of the individual preferences (Hampden-Turner and \nTrompenaars, 1993).  \n \nWhat we added to this approach  was a thorough discussion with the respondents prior to the \ndata collection of all concepts used for the research. Respondent\u2019s knowledge of the meaning of \ndifferent concepts and alternative interpretations is treated in our methodology as a vehicle for \nmutual understanding, rather than as a source of biases into the data. A shared meaning between \nresearcher and respondents is regarded as a prerequisite to \u2018clear\u2019 cultural data, rather than a \n\u2018noise\u2019 into the research situation. \n \nIn our choice for a methodology we were guided by the fact that standard techniques like Likert \ntype scales, survey questionnaire, and factor analysis can not reveal the particularistic \ncharacteristics of individual and collective behaviour. Therefore, in our methodology we aimed \nat using not only the complementarity of qualitative and quantitative techniques, but to design a \nnew approach, which will measure the most likely individual choices for an action.  \n \nWe used dichotomous scales, confronting the respondents with irreconcilable positions, and \nrequiring that respondents associate themselves with one of the options, disclosing in this way \ntheir personal predispositions for an action. This approach allows an assessment of the majority \nreplies, interpreted later on as how typical is the manifested orientation in the sample. The larger \nthe proportion of the majority replies is, the stronger predisposition is observed in the sample. \n \nThis methodology was used both for the study of the perceived and the internalised cultural \nnorms. The design of the research methodology followed our understanding that the perceived \nnorm of behaviour could be identified through a conversation in public, and the internalised \nnorm requires an indirect testing method. Therefore, it was decided that our field work should \nuse two different methods - one based on a discursive technique for data collection and a \nconversation analysis, and the other - based on a test technique.  \n \nBoth methods were designed as modifications of Trompenaars\u2019 field approach, asking \nindividuals to make choices between two extreme options, and to assess qualities attributed to \nHofstede\u2019s four dimensions of culture. The questions for the measurement of the perceived \ncultural norm referred directly to Hofstede\u2019s cultural dimensions, while the questions used in the \nquestionnaire for the measurement of the internalised norm were based on the descriptors of the \nfour cultural dimensions, given by Hofstede (1980). \n \nThe action research methodology was chosen as an umbrella framework for the research. It \ninvolved both teaching the subject of comparative culture to second year undergraduate students \nof management and business administration in Byalistok Polytechnic in Poland, and studying \ntheir cultural attitudes.  \n \nThe situation, chosen for our research, was a two hour seminar on the topic of comparative \nculture with a sample of 38 students divided into three mixed male\/female groups, age between \n18 and 25 years. This sample for our exploratory research could be labelled accidental and it \nrepresents only this particular age and occupation group. However, students were instructed to \nrefer not only to their personal experience, but to what they perceive is the value norm within \n 10\ntheir families, communities and nationhood. This gives us a reason to believe that the perceived \nnorm represents a typical cultural predisposition at national level. \n \nThe seminar combined both educational and research objectives. The main educational objective \nwas to facilitate learning by discovery in the area of comparative cultural attitudes. The emphasis \nof the research aspect was the comparison between a group assessment of the cultural values and \nattitudes (considered to be typical for the Polish people) and an individual self-assessment \nthrough responses to our questionnaire.  \n \nHofstede's research findings were used to introduce the leading theories and concepts in \norganisational and management culture, and to launch our own research project with the \nstudents. Issues of cultural differences between nations, equality and inequality, power relations, \nsocial values and individual cultural attitudes were discussed with the students.  \n \nThe entire process of collecting the data comprised of two sets of data: Assessment of the \nperceived societal norm (or what is typical for Polish culture) through individual choices and \nvoting on each scale, and Measurement of the individual attitudes through a questionnaire \ndesigned with 18 questions - all questions required a choice between two alternatives only - Yes \nvs. No answer, or A lot vs. Very little. All questions followed Hofstede\u2019s operationalisations of \nthe four cultural dimensions. \n \nDuring the first stage of the research - the group discussion - students were encouraged to \nelaborate on their personal experience and observations of the typical for the Polish society \ncultural values, and the way they change and evolve under different influences from the \nenvironment (including political, economic, cultural factors, religion and historical tradition). \nFollowing that, students were facilitated to analyse the changes in their society through self-\nreflection and group discussion. Students were asked to state openly their choices between \nalternative propositions on the Hofstede\u2019s four dimensions. The choices were expressed by \nvoting.  \n \nDuring the second stage, students were asked to answer a questionnaire, designed on Hofstede\u2019s \ndescriptors for the four cultural dimensions. Power distance was measured through relationships \nwith the authority, including trust and disagreement with superiors. Uncertainty avoidance was \nmeasured through responses to change, risks and uncertainty. Individualism was measured \nthrough attitudes to rules, and personal expectations for the assessment of performance and \nachievements. Masculinity was measured through relationship to money, material possession, \nambition, environment, quality of life and concern with the society. \n \nThe specific objectives of the action research were the following: \n \n(1) to introduce to students Hofstede's research, and how his theory of organisational culture \ncould be applied to eastern Europe; \n(2) to assist students through a reflective discussion to achieve understanding of the concepts \n'power distance', 'uncertainty avoidance', 'individualism-collectivism' and 'masculinity-\nfemininity' and to acquire different means of assessing one's  own social experience and \nthe societal norm of behaviour; \n(3) to develop knowledge about the factors that influence transformation in organisational \nculture in Poland through students\u2019 personal accounts of the recent changes; \n 11\n(4) to observe how students change their perception of organisational culture throughout the \ndiscussion; \n(5) to throw light on the validity of different research and teaching methods applied in the \narea of comparative culture and to discuss national cultural differences in this context.  \n \nThe main steps of the research process were the following: \n \nSTEP 1: Introduction of the study of organisational culture, conducted by Hofstede with \ndefinitions of the key theoretical terms and presentation of Hofstede\u2019s \nclassification of the eight different types of cultures.  \n \nSTEP 2: Group discussion of the four scales for measurement of organisational culture, \nintroduced by Hofstede. Students then were asked to discuss how they perceive \nPolish culture in terms of these scales. In the discussion they were confronted \nwith questions to present additional arguments in support of their statements. \nThis raised students\u2019 awareness of different aspects of culture, including factors \naffecting one\u2019s values and judgements and the role of cultural norms as \nconsequences of one\u2019s socialisation in a particular society. \n \nSTEP 3: Self-reflection - students were confronted with their own different statements and \nexamples so the discussion entered a second phase of deep reflection on the \nmeaning and possible interpretation of the theoretical concepts. Students were \nreminded at all stages of the discussion that while using particular examples the \ntask is to identify what is typical for Polish culture (inspite of gender, age, \noccupation, or employment differences). \n \nSTEP 4: Assessment of the perceived societal norm - the group had to assess what is \ntypical for Polish culture through individual choices and voting on each scale (for \nexample, large vs. low power distance). All students were encouraged to think \nthat there is no right or wrong answer that usually there is a spread of opinions in \na society and through this experiment they will find out more about their own \nculture. For three of the scales students insisted on additional proposition - \nmedium power distance, medium uncertainty avoidance and mixed masculinity-\nfemininity. Results were recorded for further comparison. \n \nSTEP 5: Measurement of the individual attitudes - students were asked to answer a \nquestionnaire designed with 18 questions, expressing their opinion not on what is \ntypical for the Polish culture, but reflecting upon their personal experience, \nbeliefs and attitudes. All questions required a choice between two alternatives \nonly - Yes vs. No answer, or A lot vs. Very little. There was one open question on \npower distance included in the questionnaire. It required students to describe \nsituations in which they would disagree with their boss \/ superior.  \n \nSTEP 6: Analysis - students provided technical assistance in the preliminary analysis of \nthe results from the questionnaire including the analysis of the open question on \npower distance. The results from the voting were compared with the results from \nthe questionnaire and the discrepancies were discussed openly. Both the students \nand the researcher as a seminar tutor offered alternative explanations for the \ndiscrepancies in the two sets of results. \n 12\n \nThere is obviously a question whether the two types of data collection are compatible. Our \nargument is that they were designed within the same theoretical framework - Hofstede\u2019s four \ncultural dimensions, and applied with the same fieldwork method of forced choice decision \nsituation. The questions for the questionnaire were based on the descriptors, proposed by \nHofstede (1980). \n \nThe main difference between our two methods for data collection was the recording of the \nquestions and responses. The first technique implying verbal questions using directly Hofstede\u2019s \nconcepts and required publicly announced choices by the respondents. The second technique \nimplied written questions that referred to attributes of Hofstede\u2019s four dimensions, and required \nprivate choices by the respondents. \n \nDiscussion Of The Findings \n \nThe main results are presented in Fig. 1. Two profiles of Polish cultural attitudes are described. \nThe first one is based on the vote by the students during the open discussion and the second one \nis based on the questionnaire responses. Both profiles represent the majority replies, or the mode \nin the distribution. The two profiles show significant discrepancies between what is perceived by \nthe individuals as a typical cultural value, and what is the internalised value manifested in their \nquestionnaire replies.  \n \nFig. 1: Profiles of the Polish organisational culture  \n  \n       \nA1\nA2\nA3\nB1\nB2\nB3\nC1\nC2\nC3\nD1\nD2\nD3\n X\n47%\n X\n48%\n X\n84%\nX   84%\nO  50%\n O\n54%\n O\n52%\n O\n54%\nLow Power\nDistance\nHigh Power\nDistance\nLow Uncertainty\nAvoidance\nHigh\nIndividualism\nHigh\nMasculinity\nLow Individualism \/\nHigh Collectivism\nLow Masculinity \/\nHigh Femininity\nHigh Uncertainty\nAvoidance\nMedium \/ Mixed\nAttitudes\nA (1,2,3) - power distance scale\nB (1,2,3) - uncertainty avoidance scale\nC (1,2,3) - individualism \/ collectivism scale\nD (1,2,3) - masculinity \/ femininity scale\n- profile of the perceived form\n- profile of the internalised form\n \n \nThe three rows on Fig. 1 represent three types of predispositions. Type 1 (including A1, B1, C1, \nD1) is labelled Independence attitude and comprises of affiliation to low power distance, low \nuncertainty avoidance, high individualism and high masculinity. The second type includes all \nintermediate characteristics - medium power distance (A2) and uncertainty avoidance (B2) and \nmixed individualism \/ collectivism (C2) and masculinity \/ femininity (D2). It could be labelled \nMixed attitudes. The third type represents Dependency attitudes. It includes high power distance \n(A3), high uncertainty avoidance (B3), high collectivism (C3) and high femininity (D3). \n 13\n \nThe results for the internalised norm of behaviour reveal a dependency type of cultural attitudes \nfor Poland, based on high power distance, high uncertainty avoidance, high collectivism, and \nmixed masculinity \/ femininity. The students\u2019 perceptions of the four cultural dimensions, \nexpressed during the discussion stage, draw a completely different profile. Students perceived \nthemselves as having medium power distance, low uncertainty avoidance, high individualism \nand mixed masculinity \/ femininity (Fig. 1). The discrepancy therefore is between what is \nperceived as a norm, and what is internalised as a norm. \n  \nThe perceived norm is measured through three categories rather than two. Interesting fact is that \nthe intermediate category, introduced during the discussion phase on request by the students, \nattracted the majority of students\u2019 responses only on the scales of power distance and \nmasculinity. \n \nOn three of the dimensions we observed significant differences between the perceived and the \ninternalised norm - \u2018power distance\u2019, \u2018uncertainty avoidance\u2019 and \u2018individualism\u2019. More details \nof the scores on each scale are given in the Fig. 2-5. \n \nFig. 2: Power Distance Value Compared \n \n Perceived Norm Internalised Norm \nHigh Power Distance 21% 54% \nMedium Power Distance 47%  \nLow Power distance 32% 46% \n \nThe internalised norm of high power distance (54%) could be explained both with the role of the \nCatholic church with its hierarchical structure and philosophy (as suggested by the students \nduring the group discussion), and with the extensive hierarchical structures, developed in \norganisations as part of the bureaucratic machine of the central planning system. However, \naccording to the students\u2019 self-assessment, expressed openly through the discussion, typical for \nthe Polish society is a medium power distance (47% of the respondents), toped-up by another \n32% who believe that the societal norm is low power distance.  \n \nOur explanation of these results lies in the role of the communist ideology during the past few \ndecades proclaiming equality in all aspects of social life. However, the recent experience of the \nPoles has indicated to them a rising inequality and a rapid differentiation of the society in terms \nof income and opportunities. Students were aware that they have to compromise their views and \nthey insisted on a third category which was not offered initially - medium power distance. We \nbelieve this indicates a process of a massive shift in their attitudes, and is a result of contradictory \ninfluences on the value system related to authority and power. \n \nInteresting are the answers that students provided on the open question in the questionnaire, \nrelated to the power distance scale5. Asked about the reasons for disagreement with their \nsuperior, they offered two types of reasons. We labelled them rational (or clear), and therefore \nindividuals are ready to confront the authority, and irrational (or vague) reasons, where there is a \nlarge distance between the emotional response and the predisposition for an action.  \n \n                     \n5The results from the open question were obtained through a text analysis of the students\u2019 replies. \n 14\nAmong the rational reasons for disagreement with the authority students included: assessment \nresults, work overload, decisions, discrimination, reliability. Among the irrational reasons they \nincluded: authoritative opinion, lack of tolerance, suppression, ignorance, irresponsibility, style. \nThe rational reasons were interpreted as high awareness of the exact role relationship and \ntherefore indicating low power distance. The irrational reasons were interpreted as unclear \nreasoning which expressed negative feelings against the existing authoritative relationship, and \ntherefore indicated high power distance in terms of readiness for action. These answers were \nincluded in the final measurement of the power distance index. \n \nFig. 3: Uncertainty Avoidance Value Compared \n \n Perceived Norm Internalised Norm \nHigh Uncertainty Avoidance 13% 52% \nMedium Uncertainty Avoidance 39%  \nLow Uncertainty Avoidance 48% 48% \n \nIn relation to the category uncertainty avoidance we observe another discrepancy between what \nis perceived as typical for the Polish people - low uncertainty avoidance (48%) - and what is \ninternalised as a norm - high uncertainty avoidance (52%). Our explanation of these results lies \nin the role of the communist system and its claims to provide security for the population. It had \ninduced expectations of protection and certainty.  \n \nThis norm obviously has been internalised by the young generation even though their present and \nmore distant history maintains the image of a self-reliant individual, driven by entrepreneurial \nmotives. Students therefore opted for low uncertainty avoidance as a perceived norm, \u2018desirable\u2019 \nby the people. However, they themselves demonstrated high uncertainty avoidance as \ninternalised norm of behaviour. \n \nFig. 4: Individualism \/Collectivism Value Compared \n \n Perceived Norm Internalised \nNorm \nHigh Individualism 84% 46% \nMixed Individualism \/ Collectivism   \nLow Individualism \/ High Collectivism 16% 54% \n \nThis was the only scale on which students did not insist on an intermediate category of mixed \nindividualism and collectivism. Their explanation during the discussion for the high \nindividualism choice was quite clear. They referred to the Catholic church which projects the \nindividuals as wholly responsible for their actions. The figure of 84%  for high individualism \nassessed through the voting is the highest in the whole research profile. Both the researcher and \nthe respondents were surprised by the results for the internalised norm, which measured clearly a \nchoice of low individualism, or high collectivism (with a majority of 54%).  \n \nThe joint researcher and respondents interpretation of this discrepancy refers to conflicting \nvalues and fears of high pressure from the environment. Individuals expect that this \nenvironmental threats will require support from a social group to secure both success and \nsurvival. As a consequence of that, we may expect that individual\u2019s behaviour will be \n 15\nsituationaly determined and may vary from case to case. Individuals will still seek social \nrecognition, but will be prepared to take individual responsibilities. \n \nFig. 5: Masculinity \/Femininity Value Compared \n \n Perceived Norm Internalised \nNorm \nHigh Masculinity  50% \nMixed - With Predominant Masculinity 84%  \nMixed - With Predominant Femininity 16%  \nHigh Femininity  50% \n \nOn this scale students almost refuse to accept the two extremes. They were able to perceive only \nthe category of mixed masculinity and femininity. They all supported the option for a medium \nmasculinity value 84%. The result from the voting confirms the result from the questionnaire - a \nmixed masculinity-femininity attitude which corresponds with Hofstede\u2019s medium masculinity. \nThis suggests that individuals tolerate both independence and interdependence and they aspire \nboth nurturing attitude - oriented towards people, and a more decisive attitude - oriented towards \nachievements and money (see Hofstede, 1980).  \n \nThe discrepancy between the two profiles raises the question of which account is more valid. If \nwe take Trompenaars definition of culture as a particular way of solving problems, we may \nargue that the internalised norm will have much stronger impact on decisions and choices and \ntherefore will determine directly the individual\u2019s behaviour. If we look at Hofstede\u2019s analysis, we \nmay argue that both the perceived norm and the internalised norm may influence the individual\u2019s \nbehaviour. In a situation of high social visibility that requires high responsibilities individuals \nmay refer to the perceived norm, as \u2018desired\u2019 and \u2018expected by people\u2019. In other situations, the \ninternalised norm may have a stronger impact on behaviour. \n \nWhat is important here, is the fact that there are different personal constructs that may determine \nindividual\u2019s behaviour in a problem situation. The individual has the full \u2018liberty\u2019 to resort to any \nprevious experience, or any constructed predispositions for an action. It depends entirely on the \nsituation, and the way the individual assesses the expectations of the \u2018others\u2019 from him\/her. Both \nnorms could be triggered with equal chances. Therefore, our view is that both profiles are \nrepresentative for Poland, considering the limitations of the sample size and selection. \n \n \nConclusions \n \nThe main outcomes of the action research were twofold: firstly, contribution to academic \nknowledge (pilot testing of the application of Hofstede\u2019s cultural dimensions to eastern Europe), \nand secondly, dissemination of academic knowledge, achieving students' deep understanding of \nthe key concepts from comparative cultural theory. Students' main satisfaction was related to the \nsuccessful completion of the research, and to the opportunity to reflect upon their own values and \nattitudes from an external perspective.  \n \nThe results from the research show a large discrepancy between what is communicated between \npeople as social values and what has been internalised as personal values and attitudes. Possible \nexplanations are, on one hand, the nature of the cultural norms of behaviour as dynamic \n 16\nconstructs that determine individual preferences and choices, and on the other hand - the \nprocesses of societal change that affect collective beliefs and values.  \n \nThe results confirm our first two hypotheses - that there are different cultural norms determining \nindividual conduct, and that there is a variation in the orientation of behaviour which these norms \ninduce. If we generalise upon our results, we could expect that in all societies and cultures we \nmay have at least two different norms - an internalised and externalised one.  \n \nThe implications for international management practices are that in different situations \nindividuals will make different choices according to one or another norm. There are many \ntraining courses for international managers that are built upon Hofstede\u2019s cultural profiles, and \nthat project managerial behaviour on that ground. What our findings show, is that national \ncultures do not affect behaviour in a simple deterministic manner, but facilitate individual\u2019s \nchoices for an action. \n \nReferring back to Hofstede\u2019s findings, it is not clear which norm he has actually measured. Most \nof his questions relate to working in organisations, rather than the wider value system of the \nrespondents. \n \nOur third hypothesis was related to the processes of fundamental change that are taking place in \neastern Europe. Due to a lack of previous data on cultural attitudes it is difficult to assess what is \nthe direction of the cultural dynamics. We may expect that all societies undergoing rapid changes \n(including the rapid growth in South-East Asia) will be rebuilding their cultural base which will \nundermine existing norms of behaviour and generate new ones. What we see as a difference \nbetween internalised and externalised norm may in fact be a difference between the tradition and \nthe new socialisation. Further research will be able to provide more answers to these questions.  \n \nEarly reference to this kind of cultural dynamics is made by Fromm (1995) who discusses the \nprocess of commodification of individuals in modern societies due to their awareness of labour \nmarkets and value. As individuals become conscious of the fact that their labour could be bought \nand sold, they discover also that they could \u2018invest\u2019 personal efforts to increase their own  \n\u2018commodity value\u2019. Although Fromm sees this process in the context of industrialisation of \nsocieties, it is certainly an issue related to the process of \u2018marketisation\u2019 which is taking place in \neastern Europe.  \n \nThis also suggests that in rapidly changing societies, that are departing from established \ntraditions, we may expect different and sometimes contradictory cultural attitudes that could \ntrigger opposite behaviour. The implications for international management would be the \nincreased uncertainty of the cultural environment, and the unpredictability of the behaviour of \nemployees or partners in negotiations. \n \nAccording to students\u2019 perceptions of what is typical for Polish culture, it is Medium Power \nDistance, Low Uncertainty Avoidance, High Individualism, and Medium Masculinity. The \nmedium power distance means that they believe in equality and shared democratic values. The \nlow uncertainty avoidance could be interpreted as a strong support for entrepreneurial activities. \nThe belief in high individualism means that people are prepared to take responsibilities \nthemselves, and the medium masculinity response suggests an attitude to balance and harmony \nbetween the personal and the societal sphere. \n \n 17\nWhat our research has produced as a profile of internalised values is High Power Distance, High \nUncertainty Avoidance, High Collectivism, and Medium Masculinity. These results could be \ninterpreted as alienation from authority, intense feelings of insecurity, or need for protection, a \nstrong need for social recognition and support, and internalised values of balance and harmony \nbetween the personal and the societal sphere. \n \nStudents' insights from the debate provided significant information about the leading factors \nexercising pressure for change of the values and attitudes, like the macro-economic situation, the \npolitical discourse of the new political parties, the rapid democratic changes and the role of \nprivatisation, the role of the Catholic Church and the old traditions in Polish culture. However, \nmajor limitation of this exploratory study is that it needs further verification of both the \nmethodology applied, and the results which derived from a fairly small sample with narrow \nrepresentation. \n \nFinally, we would like to address the question - how different is Poland from its east European \nneighbours? Each of the east European countries differs in its historical and cultural heritage. \nAnalysing Polish historical roots, Gomulka and Polonsky highlight some features like the \nromantic nationalism, the belief in \u2018gentry democracy\u2019 (or elected monarchy), the desire to \nrespect minority opinions, and a deep-rooted egalitarianism of the Polish society (Gomulka and \nPolonsky, 1990). These \u2018paradoxes\u2019 according to the authors are a result to a great extent of the \npartitioning powers which ruled Poland for large periods during the eighteenth and nineteenth \ncenturies. The foreign authority has generated a division between a sacred patriotic sphere and \nthe \u2018greyness of everyday life\u2019 in the hearts of the ordinary citizens. This feature has been further \nenforced during the communist period.  \n \nHowever, the duality between the formal and the informal sphere of life is perhaps one of the \ndistinctive features of all east European societies during the years of the socialist system. The \nargument that Poland is somehow different in terms of historically rooted public attitudes and \nbeliefs, is difficult to sustain compared with the other countries in the region. The public \nresponse during the events of 1989 - 90 in all east European countries demonstrated that below \nthe surface of formal totalitarian rule, there was a dynamic informal sphere of self-perception, \nattitudes and relationships. \n \nOn these grounds, we would expect more similarities between east European nations in regard to \ntheir cultural predispositions. On the other hand, the mere fact of different languages, different \ninstitutional framework of government, different representation of religions in each country, and \ndifferent historical experiences, suggests that different cultural predispositions would have been \ninstitutionalised and widely shared within the different national boundaries. Further comparative \nresearch is required to through light on this major question. \n  \n \nReferences \n \nAdler, N., (1991) International Dimensions of Organisational Behaviour. 2\/e, Wadsworth Publ. \nCo., Belmont, California.  \nBarrett, G. & Bass, B., (1970) \u201cCulture and Other Explanatory Variables in Comparative \nManagement Studies\u201d, Academy of Management Journal, 13 (1970), pp. 153-163. \nBartlett, C. & Ghoshal, S., (1995) Transnational Management: Text Cases, and Readings in \nCross-Border Management. 2\/e, Irwin, London. \n 18\nBrown, A., (1995) Organisational Culture.
