This\ngoal requires reliable, quantitative and representa-\ntive, input and output data in terms of both com-\npositions and volumes.\n[3] Ancient Pacific crust (Jurassic, [Pringle, 1992;\nBartolini and Larson, 2001]) about to be sub-\nducted at the Mariana-Izu-Bonin subduction zone\nwas drilled during ODP Legs 129 and 185 to\nsample the material soon to be subducted. Several\nsites (including 801 and 1149) were drilled and\nlogged seaward of the Mariana and Izu-Bonin\ntrench systems (Figure 1). The processes operating\nwithin the arc systems and the physical attributes\nof the subduction zones have been extensively\ncharacterized such that the subduction geometry\n[Taylor, 1992; Van der Hilst and Senon, 1993;\nFryer et al., 1999], the convergence vectors, the\nthickness of upper plate and slab temperature, are\nall fairly well defined [Van der Hilst and Senon,\n1993; Fouch and Fischer, 1996; Suyehiro et al.,\n1996]. Complete sediment subduction occurs at\nboth the Mariana and Izu-Bonin trenches [Taylor,\n1992]. The upper plate in both cases is oceanic, so\nthe effects of crustal contamination on arc magmas\nare minimal. However, there are variations in the\ngeochemical signal of the arc volcanoes both\nalong strike and across the Mariana-Izu-Bonin\nvolcanic arc system [Stern et al., 1990; Tatsumi\net al., 1992; Elliot et al., 1997; Peate and Pearce,\n1998; Ishikawa and Tera, 1999]. These variations\nmay be attributed to a number of factors, such as\nthe nature of the inputs to the subduction zone, the\nprocesses operating within the subduction zone,\nthe physical attributes of the subduction zone, or a\ncombination of any or all of these. There are a\nwide range of inputs to the system including\nsediments, seamounts and altered oceanic crust.\nKey tracer elements for mass balance calculations,\nsuch as Th, Rare Earth Element (REE), Ba or Be\nare stored within sediments deposited on the\nsubducting plate but the principal reservoir for\nother elements, particularly K, B, U, CO2 and\nH2O, is the uppermost, oxidised portion of the\nvolcanic ocean basement. The input of these\nelements to an arc system varies as a function of\nboth the sediment composition [Plank and Lang-\nmuir, 1998] and the structure of the volcanic\nbasement [Staudigel et al., 1995, 1996; Alt et\nal., 1998; Alt and Teagle, 1999]. It is therefore\ncritical to obtain accurate estimates of the compo-\nsition of the subducted oceanic crust.\n[4] Amajor problem arising during drilling in ocean\ncrust is that complete core recovery is rare due to the\nfractured nature of the rocks and large contrasts in\nthe competency of the material drilled. It is therefore\ndifficult to determine a reliable and representative\naverage composition for the oceanic crust, particu-\nlarly considering that the altered or brecciated por-\ntions, containing most of the mobile elements, are\nusually more poorly recovered [Brewer et al., 1998;\nLovell et al., 1998;Breweret al., 1999]. DuringODP\nLegs 129 and 185, 474mof oceanic crust was drilled\nat Hole 801C, thus providing a significant penetra-\ntion of the upper oceanic basement, but only 47% of\nthe basement cored was recovered (Figure 2).\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 rE\u00b4villon et al.: inputs to subduction zones 10.1029\/2002GC000344\n2 of 22\n[5] To estimate the overall composition of the\noceanic crust, one approach utilises a physical\nmixture of different rock types, with sample pow-\nders combined to produce a \u2018\u2018composite\u2019\u2019 sample\n[Staudigel et al., 1995, 1996; Plank et al., 2000].\nSmall amounts of material from a large number of\nsamples are combined in one or several composite\nsamples. However, even if the recovered cores are\nquantitatively described, it is difficult to combine\neach rock type in the correct proportions because\nthe cores are generally not fully representative of\nthe drilled basement.\n[6] In this paper, we present an alternative approach,\nin which geochemical analyses and logging data,\nspecifically the gamma-ray data are integrated to\nprovide a continuous record of geochemical varia-\ntions. We also demonstrate that gamma ray data,\nyielded by wire line logging, can be used as a proxy\nfor K2O and U contents downhole.\n2. Geological Background, and Results\nFrom Core-Log Integration\n[7] Hole 801C is located within the Pigafetta Basin\nin West Pacific oceanic crust (Figure 1). It lies\nwithin the Jurassic magnetic quiet zone and pene-\ntrates the oldest oceanic crust drilled to date, at 166 \u00b1\n4.5 Ma from radiometric dating [Pringle, 1992] or\n170\u2013175 Ma from biostratigraphic studies [Barto-\nlini and Larson, 2001]. This crust formed at fast\nspreading rates [Plank et al., 2000]. Hole 801C was\nfirst drilled during ODP Leg 129, to a total depth of\n594 meters below seafloor (mbsf ) [Lancelot et al.,\n1990]. The entire sedimentary pile was drilled dur-\nFigure 1. Location map of ODP Leg 185 Sites 801 and 1149 in relation to the Marianna arc system.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 rE\u00b4villon et al.: inputs to subduction zones 10.1029\/2002GC000344\n3 of 22\ning Leg 129 and approximately 130 m into the\nbasement. During ODP Leg 185, the hole was re-\nentered and deepened to 935.4 mbsf [Plank et al.,\n2000]. Site 801C was first logged during ODP Leg\n144 [Shipboard Scientific Party, 1993; Haggerty et\nal., 1995] and re-logged during Leg 185 [Plank et\nal., 2000]. The basement stratigraphy of the logged\ninterval in Hole 801C (Figure 2) comprises seven\nmajor eruptive sequences (see also Plank et al.\n[2000] and Barr et al. [2002] for a more detailed\ndescription). The uppermost section consists of\nalkali basalts and extends from 490 to 510 mbsf\n[Floyd and Castillo, 1992]. A sequence of tholeiitic\nupper massive flows, from 530 to 590 mbsf, is\nseparated from the alkali basalts by a first hydro-\nthermal zone at 510\u2013530 mbsf. The next section\nconsists of pillows and flow units, down to 715mbsf\nand a second hydrothermal zone occurs within this\nFigure 2. Results of the core-log integration study. Shown from left to right are the recovery during leg 185, the\nlithology column established from the cores, the basement section units and the lithology column extracted from the\ndownhole logging data.

The lower sequence\nof massive flows extends down to 835 mbsf and is\nfollowed by a thick breccia unit (Figure 2).\n[8] Wire line logging data, including physical prop-\nerties measurements such as velocity, resistivity,\nporosity, density, gamma ray and FMS (Formation\nMicroScanner) images were used to reconstruct a\ncomplete basement section [Barr et al., 2002]. The\nrock types were first identified within recovered\ncored intervals and criteria were defined to extrap-\nolate to sections of poor recovery. This integration of\ncore and logging data has allowed us to establish a\ncontinuous downhole stratigraphy. Results of this\nintegration are summarized in Figure 2 (and pre-\nsented in detail in Barr et al. [2002]). The results\nhighlight a significant difference in the proportions\nof pillow basalts and breccia, with twice the amount\nof pillow material (32.7% compared with 15.3%\npresent or 27.8% if recovered core proportions are\nexpanded to 100% recovery), and six times more\nbreccia (31.3% comparedwith 4.5%present or 8.1%\nfor the expanded value) than is indicated by consid-\nering the recovered core description alone. The\nproportion of massive basalt is approximately the\nsame for the two approaches (27.4% compared with\n33.4% present) but highly overestimated if an\nexpanded approach is adopted (60.6%) (see also\nBarr et al. [2002] for a complete discussion). Sim-\nilarly the proportions of interpillow sediments and\nhydrothermal material are almost equal, although it\nshould be noted that the proportion of interpillow\nsediment reported after core-log integration is likely\nan underestimate, because some pillow or breccia\nunits contained sediments that were not distin-\nguished as separate logging units [Barr et al., 2002].\n3. Analytical Techniques\n3.1. Logging Data\n[9] The natural radioactivity of the formation was\nmeasured using the Hostile Environment Natural\nGamma Ray Sonde (HNGS) and the Natural\nGamma Ray Tool (NGT). The HNGS and NGT\nrecord the radioactivity of a formation, which is due\nto the presence of the naturally occurring radio-\nactive isotopes of K, U and Th [Rider, 1996].\nConventional tools consist of a scintillation counter,\nnormally a sodium iodide crystal, and a photo-\nmultiplier. Measured energy values can be used to\nidentify the gamma radiations in several energy\nwindows, which in turn can be used to separate\nthe energy peaks of the individual radioactive\nelements [Rider, 1996]. Although the data for the\ndifferent tool runs are all in good agreement, we\nhave used the data from the main HNGS run from\nLeg 185 for this study. The HNGS makes similar\nmeasurements to the NGT but the HNGS has a\ngreater sensitivity and is capable of making meas-\nurements in difficult hole conditions. The HNGS\nemploys bismuth germanate scintillation detectors,\nwhich are more sensitive than the sodium iodide\ncrystal used by the NGT and afford better nuclear\ndecay statistics. The HNGS measures total gamma\nand uses 5-window spectroscopy to resolve the\ndetected spectrum into K, U and Th concentrations.\nThe high-energy part of the spectrum is divided into\nthree energy windows, each covering a character-\nistic peak of the three radioactivity series. The\nconcentration of each component is determined\nfrom the count rates in each window. Because the\nhigh-energy region contains only 10% of the total\nspectrum count rates, the measurements are subject\nto large statistical variations, even using a low log-\nging speed. The results are considerably improved\nby including the contribution from the low-energy\npart of the spectrum. Filtering techniques are used to\nfurther reduce the statistical noise by comparing and\naveraging counts at a certain-depth with counts\nsampled just before and just after. The final outputs\nare the total gamma ray, a uranium-free gamma ray\nmeasurement, and the concentrations of potassium,\nthorium, and uranium. A real time borehole size\ncorrection is also applied to the data during acquis-\nition. The concentrations of radioactive elements\nare generally very low in fresh Mid-Ocean Ridge\nBasalts (MORB), but the gamma ray log can be a\ngood indicator of the extent of alteration degree as\nit is sensitive to the presence of potassium-bearing\nminerals and secondary minerals have relatively\nhigh K contents [Harvey et al., 1998; Borehole\nResearch Group, 2000].\n[10] The sampling interval of the tool is 15 cm and\nits vertical resolution is estimated to 46 cm [Rider,\n1996; Plank et al., 2000]. The radius of investiga-\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 rE\u00b4villon et al.: inputs to subduction zones 10.1029\/2002GC000344\n5 of 22\ntion of the tool depends on several factors such as\nthe hole size, the mud density and the energy of the\ngamma rays (a higher energy gamma ray can reach\nthe detector from deeper in the formation) [Bore-\nhole Research Group, 2000]. The concentrations\nmeasured by the tool are representative of a specific\nvolume and the signal of a small feature, a vein for\nexample, is \u2018\u2018diluted\u2019\u2019 by the signal of the surround-\ning basalt. K2O, U and Th contents reported by the\ntool in a specific interval can therefore be different\nthan those measured on specific samples, which\nusually sample a smaller volume.\n[11] Together with gamma-ray data we used FMS\nimages to help relocating the samples and to iden-\ntify the un-recovered material. The FMS is a micro-\nelectrical imaging device that responds to relative\ndifferences in conductivity in the borehole wall. The\nimages can be regarded as oriented resistivity maps\nof textural variations in the borehole walls, reflect-\ning resistivity contrasts and porosity and grain size\nvariations between the various lithologies. Dark and\nlight colors indicate low and high micro-resistivity\nrespectively [Brewer et al., 1998; Lovell et al.,\n1998; Brewer et al., 1999; Barr et al., 2002].\n3.2. Geochemical Data\n[12] Several sets of data were used for this study.\nWhole rock chemical analyses from ODP leg 129\nsamples are reported in Lancelot et al. [1990] and\nCastillo et al. [1992]. The additional analyses from\nODP leg 185 were performed on board by XRF\n[Plank et al., 2000] and at Boston University by\nICP-AES (major elements) and ICP-MS (trace\nelements) (K. A. Kelley et al., The Composition\nof Altered Oceanic Crust at ODP Sites 801 and\n1149, manuscript submitted to Geochemistry, Geo-\nphysics, Geosystems, 2002, hereinafter referred to\nas Kelley et al., submitted manuscript, 2002).\nAdditional information on analytical techniques\nand errors can be found in Kelley et al. (submitted\nmanuscript, 2002).\n3.3. Multi Sensor Track Natural Gamma\nRay (MST-NGR) Data\n[13] NGR emission was recorded for all core\nsections to measure variations in radioactive counts\nof sample rocks during Leg 185 [Plank et al.,\n2000]. The NGR system records radioactive decay\nof 40K, 232Th, and 238U, three long-period isotopes\nthat decay at an essentially constant rate within\nmeasurable timescales. NGR emission was meas-\nured every 10 cm for a 20-s period. The NGR\ninstrument was calibrated with a thorium source\nand background counts measured using a core liner\nfilled with distilled water averaged 11.75 cps over a\n30-min measurement period. Measurements in\ncounts per second can be qualitatively compared\nto the API (American Petroleum Industry) units\nobtained from borehole wire line logging. Calibra-\ntion tests were undertaken during Leg 185 and are\ndescribed in details in Plank et al. [2000]. These\nhave allowed us to estimate K2O concentrations (in\nwt.%) from the NGR data (in count per second) in\norder to compare them with the logging data. This\ncalibration assumes that the MST-NGR variations\nare largely because of K variations and was defined\nfor the tholeiitic section of Hole 801C basement.\nThe MST-NGR data were therefore not used to\ncalculate an average composition of the alkali\nupper section of the basement.\n4. Results\n4.1. Gamma Ray Data With Depth\n[14] K2O, U and Th contents, extracted from the\ngamma ray measurements (Figure 3) indicate a\ngeneral decrease in radioactivity with depth, sim-\nilar to the data collected during Leg 144 where the\ndepth profiles overlap (483\u2013560 mbsf ) [Shipboard\nScientific Party, 1993; Plank et al., 2000]. Overall,\nthere is a good match between the tool measure-\nments and the geochemical analyses. K2O contents\nare high (>2%) in the top 100 m of the basement,\ncorresponding to the upper alkali lava sequence\n(Figure 2) [Lancelot et al., 1990; Castillo et al.,\n1992; Floyd and Castillo, 1992; Floyd et al.,\n1992; Plank et al., 2000]. There is good agreement\nin this section between the measured samples and\nthe gamma ray data. In the lower section, concen-\ntrations shown by both types of data are much\nlower (<1% on average) but chemical analyses of\nsome of the samples display higher contents\n(breccias, sediments and some pillow basalts).\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 rE\u00b4villon et al.: inputs to subduction zones 10.1029\/2002GC000344\n6 of 22\nThe gamma ray curve does not show such high K\nconcentrations but these brecciated or more altered\nintervals are, however, marked by peaks on the log\ncurve.\n[15] There is also a good agreement between the U\ncontent measured in the samples and the gamma\nray logs. The overall concentrations are low, as\nexpected for MORB (0.3 ppm on average [Staudi-\ngel et al., 1996]). The difference in absolute con-\ncentration results in a more scattered curve for the\ngamma ray measurements. As noticed for K2O,\nsome samples display high U contents, probably\nreflecting a high degree of alteration and the\npresence of carbonate veins that are hosts for U\n[Farr et al., 2001]. These intervals can be also\npicked up in the gamma ray curve.\n[16] Th contents are high in the upper alkali lavas\n(\u00012.5 ppm) and decrease down section with lower\nTh concentrations (<1 ppm). Within a section\nbetween 525\u2013575 mbsf, there is a strong discrep-\nancy between the very low values measured in the\nsamples, which are usual for MORB, and the higher\nvalues reported by the tool. The source of these high\nthorium values is not well understood and a similar\npattern of thorium concentration is observed in the\nLeg 144 logging data [Shipboard Scientific Party,\n1993]. This inconsistency probably reflects an arte-\nfact from the spectral processing of the HNGS and\nNGT tools and Th concentration are not used further\nin this study.\n4.2. Methodology\n4.2.1. Sample Location\n[17] One problem arising with drilling in ocean\ncrust is that the exact sample location is lost during\nthe drilling process. On average, a 9.5 m interval is\ndrilled for each core. When recovery is <100%, it is\nODP curation convention that the entire core will be\nshifted up to the top of the core barrel. The overall\nrelative stratigraphy of the section is therefore\nFigure 3. Plots of K2O (wt.%), U (ppm) and Th (ppm) versus depth of gamma ray logging data and geochemical\nanalyses of discrete samples.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 rE\u00b4villon et al.: inputs to subduction zones 10.1029\/2002GC000344\n7 of 22\nmaintained but the depths of the different pieces are\nnot their true depths. In contrast, the logging tool\nmeasurements give a continuous record downhole,\nwith absolute depths below seafloor.\n[18] In order to directly compare logging data and\ndata measured on discrete samples it is critical to\nrelocate the samples relative to the logging depths.\nTo do this, we have matched the FMS images with\nimages of the recovered cores. Using specific\nfeatures, such as thick veins or breccia in-tervals,\non the FMS images we were able to relocate the\nsamples within the 9.5 m interval drilled by that\ncore (Figure 4). This allows the relocation of the\nFigure 4. Example of sample relocation on core 1R, section 1 and 2. As highlighted by arrows, specific features\nsuch as veins or interpillow intervals, identified on digital images of the recovered cores and the FMS images are used\nto relocate the core samples. This illustrates how the FMS images were used to assess the new depth of the samples.\nIn this case, the logging data enable to relocate section 2 with respect to section 1 and show that nothing was lost in\nthese intervals.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 rE\u00b4villon et al.: inputs to subduction zones 10.1029\/2002GC000344\n8 of 22\ndifferent sections of the core and therefore enables\nus to attribute, within error, its true depth to each\nsample. The error on the relocation shows an\ninverse relationship with the recovery (Figure 5)\nbut is also dependent on the number of identifiable\nfeatures within the core, which can be used to\nmatch the core with the FMS image. For example,\nin a continuous interval of homogeneous massive\nbasalts, there is limited variation within the FMS\nimages or the rocks recovered. It is therefore\ndifficult to accurately relocate a sample.\n4.2.2. Direct Comparison of Logging Data\nand Geochemical Data\n[19] Once the samples have been relocated with\nrespect to the logging depths, the gamma ray data\nand the whole rock geochemical analysis for K2O\nand U can be compared directly (Figures 6 and 7).\nOn overall the correlations between the two data\nsets is good indicating that the gamma ray logging\ntool measurements are reliable. Some scatters is\nobserved but can be related to various factors\ndescribed in the section below. The common\nsource of error for each lithology and chemical\nelement is the error on the sample relocation as\ndescribed in the previous section.\n4.2.2.1. Massive Basalts\n[20] Major elements (including K2O) were analysed\non 109 samples of massive basalt [Lancelot et al.,\n1990; Castillo et al., 1992; Plank et al., 2000;\nKelley et al., submitted manuscript, 2002]. Alkali\nbasalts (27 samples) can easily be distinguished\nfrom the tholeiitic basalts with their K2O contents\n(1.2\u20136.4 wt.% and <1 wt.% respectively, Figure\n6a). The agreement between the wire line logging\nand the analytical measurements for massive basalts\nis very good (note that the highest concentrations\nhave the greatest scatter in Figure 6a) with most of\nthe samples plotting on a one to one line (Figure\n6a). Scatter observed within the alkali basalt,\ntoward high values can be related to the degree of\nalteration of the individual rock sample. For the\nmassive basalts with the lowest concentrations of\nK2O (<0.5 wt.%, Figure 6e) the correlation is\nweaker and the values extracted from the logging\ntool tend to be higher than those from the chemical\nanalyses. Errors on the gamma ray values are\nestimated to 10% for K2O concentrations <1 wt.%\nand 5% for the chemical analyses (Figure 6e).\nHowever, the weaker correlation observed on Fig-\nure 6e indicates that these errors might be higher.\nThis also illustrates a major difference between the\ntwo techniques. For the chemical analyses only\nsmall, very fresh samples were chosen and these\nyielded very low K2O contents. On the other hand,\nthe logging tool measures a larger volume, which\nmay include more altered portions, therefore giving\nhigher K2O contents. Despite these differences\nbetween the two data sets this do not, in our\nopinion, rule out the method. In fact, K2O concen-\ntrations in massive basalts are very low and their\ninfluence on the average composition calculated per\ncore (see below) will be low. For example, using\ndata reported in Table 1 (Core 12R) an increase of\n100% K2O on the average massive basalt com-\nposition (from 0.05 wt.% to 0.1 wt.%) will result\nonly in a 10% difference in the average K2O content\nfor the core (from 0.29% to 0.32% using the core-\nderived proportions and from 0.79% to 0.83% using\nthe log-derived proportions, Table 1).\n[21] U was analysed on 36 massive basalt samples\n(9 alkali basalts and 25 tholeiites, Figure 7a)\n[Castillo et al., 1992; Kelley et al., submitted\nFigure 5. Plot of recovery (%) versus the error on the\nsample relocation (m). There is a clear correlation\nbetween these two parameters and the error on location\nincreases when the recovery decreases.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 rE\u00b4villon et al.: inputs to subduction zones 10.1029\/2002GC000344\n9 of 22\nmanuscript, 2002]. As for K2O, the alkali basalts\nare easily distinguished by higher U concentrations\n(U > \u00011 ppm) and the tholeiites display low U\ncontents (U < \u00010.5 ppm) (Figure 7a). The corre-\nlation between the chemical analyses and the\nlogging data is fairly good given that the detection\nlimit of the tool is usually estimated to 1 ppm. The\ngamma ray data tend to be higher than the chem-\nical analyses, which might also be related to the\naveraging effect of the logging tool.\n4.2.2.2. Pillows Basalts\n[22] K2O was measured on 90 samples of pillow\nbasalt [Lancelot et al., 1990; Castillo et al., 1992;\nFigure 6. Plots of K2O (wt.%) measured on discrete samples versus K2O (wt.%) measured by the gamma ray\nlogging tool for the different rock types identified during Leg 185. (a) Massive basalts; (b) pillow basalts; (c) breccia;\n(d) sediments and hydrothermal units; (e) zoom of plots Figures 6a and 6b. Errors bars represent 5% error for the\nchemical analyses and 10% error for the gamma ray data.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 rE\u00b4villon et al.: inputs to subduction zones 10.1029\/2002GC000344\n10 of 22\nPlank et al., 2000; Kelley et al., submitted manu-\nscript, 2002]. The K2O contents measured on dis-\ncrete samples of pillow basalts cover a larger range\nthan for massive basalts, from \u00010.1 wt.% up to 7\nwt.%. The agreement between the two datasets is\nfairly good for the low concentrations (0 < K2O < 1\nw%) (Figures 6b and 6e). For the highest concen-\ntrations, the K2O contents measured on individual\nsamples are higher than those reported by the\ngamma ray tool (Figure 6b). For concentrations\nbelow 0.5 wt.%, the concentrations measured by\nthe logging tool are higher than those obtained\nfrom the chemical analyses, as observed for the\nmassive basalts (Figure 6e).\n[23] U was analysed on 26 samples [Castillo et al.,\n1992; Kelley et al., submitted manuscript, 2002]\nfrom the tholeiitic section. As observed for the\nFigure 7. Plots of U (ppm) measured on discrete samples versus U (ppm) measured by the gamma ray logging tool\nfor the different rock types identified during Leg 185. (a) Massive basalts; (b) pillow basalts; (c) breccia; and (d)\nsediments and hydrothermal units.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 rE\u00b4villon et al.: inputs to subduction zones 10.1029\/2002GC000344\n11 of 22\nmassive basalts, the correlation between the two\ndata sets is less well defined for U than for K\n(Figure 7b).\n4.2.2.3. Breccia\n[24] K2O was measured on 21 samples of volcanic\nbreccia [Lancelot et al., 1990; Castillo et al., 1992;\nPlank et al., 2000; Kelley et al., submitted manu-\nscript, 2002]. As observed for pillow basalts, K2O\nconcentrations measured on discrete samples dis-\nplay a large range (\u00010.1\u2013>4 wt%) and are higher\nthan those reported by the logging tool (Figure 6c).\nThere is, however, a close correlation between the\nnature of the samples and the difference between\nthe two data sets. Samples, which show the highest\nK2O concentrations in the chemical analyses, are\nalso those that contain more matrix than basalt\nclasts (see also discussion and Plank et al. [2000]\nfor a full description of the samples).\n[25] U was analysed on 16 samples from the\ntholeiitic section [Castillo et al., 1992; Kelley et\nal., submitted manuscript, 2002]. The correlation\nbetween the two data sets is fairly good as most\nsamples plot close to the one to one line (Figure 7c).\n4.2.2.4. Sediments and Hydrothermal Units\n[26] K2O was measured on 10 samples of inter-\npillow sedimentary material and 4 samples from\nboth upper and lower hydrothermal units [Lancelot\net al., 1990; Plank et al., 2000; Kelley et al.,\nsubmitted manuscript, 2002]. The sediments sam-\nples display similar trends to those observed for\npillow basalts and breccia. K2O contents range\nfrom \u00010.1 wt.% to \u00014 wt.% and K2O contents\ncalculated from the logging tool data are lower than\nthose measured on discrete samples (Figure 6d).\nAll the samples from the hydrothermal units plot\nwithin a narrow range and both techniques yielded\nvery low K2O contents (<0.1 wt.% for the chemical\nanalyses and <0.5 wt.% for the gamma ray tool)\n(Figure 6d). Given the very small number of\nsamples, it is difficult to give a reliable interpreta-\ntion on the hydrothermal units.\n[27] U was analysed on 7 sediment samples and 2\nhydrothermal samples [Kelley et al., submitted\nmanuscript, 2002]. Given the low U contents of\nthese samples, the correlation between the two data\nsets is reasonably good for both the sediments and\nthe hydrothermal units (Figure 7d).\n4.2.3. Average K2O and U Contents Per\nCore\n[28] To estimate the K2O and U budgets in Hole\n801C basement, average contents were calculated\nfor each core using the expanded core-derived\nproportions, the log-derived proportions and the\ngamma ray logging data. For each core an average\ncomposition is obtained by a mass balance calcu-\nlation. K2O contents calculations for core 12R are\nreported in Table 1 and Figure 8 as an example. The\naverage chemical composition of samples from\neach lithology (Table 1) is first balanced by the\nproportions of each lithology recovered in the core\nand scaled to 100% recovery (Figure 8, Table 1).\nThen, using the core-log integration results, a rock\ntype is attributed to the un-recovered interval and\nTable 1.

A new average\nconcentration is then calculated using the same\nchemical compositions and balanced by log-derived\nproportions (Figure 8, Table 1). The contents from\nthe gamma ray logging tool were calculated by\naveraging all the measurements over an interval\nspecific to each core. (Figure 8, Table 1). If all the\ndifferent lithologies were not recovered or analysed\nfor a particular core, then average compositions of\nthe different rock types were used instead. These\ncalculations were performed on all cores for K2O,\nexcept cores 3R and 13R because of their very low\nrecovery (respectively 10% and 3.7%) (Table 2).\nFigure 8. Example (core 12R) of K2O average content calculation per core. The core lithology, the FMS images, the\ngamma ray data and geochemical analyses are reported versus depth. The FMS images and the gamma ray data are\nused to identify the missing rock type(s). Then the geochemical analyses of recovered samples are used to calculate an\naverage K2O content for the core together with an average of K2O content measured by the gamma ray tool over this\nspecific

Errors on this type of calculations are\ndifficult to estimate as they depend on various\nfactors. For the average compositions calculated\nusing the core derived proportions the main sources\nof error are (a) the analytical error on the chemical\nanalyses and (b) the identification of each lithology\nwithin the core and their proportions, calculated\nfrom the core images. The number of samples\navailable per core for the calculations is an addi-\ntional source of error as average compositions were\nused when all the lithologies were not analysed in a\ncore. Errors on this set of calculations were esti-\nmated to be slightly higher than the analytical error\nand set at 10% (Table 2). For the second set of\ncalculations, performed with the log-derived pro-\nportions, errors are to be higher than the previous\nones, as they also depend on our ability to identify\nthe missing lithologies. This also depends on the\nrecovery, as the error on the un-recovered material\nwill decrease with the recovery increasing. Errors\nfor these concentrations were estimated to be twice\nhigher than for the previous calculations and set at\n20% (Table 2). Finally, errors on the logging data\nmeasurement alone are usually estimated to 10%\nfor concentrations below 1% for K2O and 10 ppm\nfor U, which are the range of most of the Hole 801C\nbasement section (Table 2).\n4.2.4. MST-NGR Data\n[29] For a comparison, we also calculated K2O\nconcentrations for each core using the MST-NGR\ndata measured during Leg 185 [Plank et al., 2000].\nThese were obtained simply by averaging all the\ndata measured per core. We used the calibration\ndefined during Leg 185 for K [Plank et al., 2000]\nand applied it on the tholeiitic section of Hole\n801C basement (Table 2).\n5. Discussion\n5.1. Can We Use Gamma Ray Data as a\nProxy for Chemical Composition\nDownhole?\n[30] The average K2O contents per core, calculated\nwith the core-derived proportions are more scat-\ntered than those calculated using the log-derived\nproportions (Figure 9a). The latter plot closely on a\none to one line, indicating a close agreement\nbetween the gamma ray data and K2O contents\ncalculated from the samples using the new propor-\ntions, adjusted for missing intervals (Figure 9a).\nThe average concentrations per core, calculated\nusing the MST-NGR data are also more scattered\nthan those calculated using log-derived propor-\ntions. These concentrations plot close to the con-\ntents calculated using the core-derived proportions,\nalthough usually closer to the 1:1 line (Figure 9a).\nThis result can be expected, as the MST-NGR data,\nmeasured on the recovered cores, also do not take\ninto account the missing intervals. It demonstrates,\nhowever, the reliability of MST-NGR data and\ntheir close agreement with the chemical composi-\ntions of the samples. It also shows an averaging\neffect related to this type of data and comparable to\nthe one observed for logging data. The volume of\ncore analysed with the MST-NGR tool will be\nlarger than the discrete sample measured by chem-\nistry and therefore variations in the chemical com-\npositions reported by the MST-NGR data will be\nless extreme.\n[31] Most of the K2O contents calculated with the\ncore-derived proportions are lower than the content\nreported by the wire line logging tool (Figure 9a).\nThis is related to two main effects: (a) the logging\ntool overestimates the K2O contents or (b) using\nthe core-derived proportions results in a bias\nagainst K2O-rich rock types. The second explan-\nation is likely as potassium will be more abundant\nin the most altered part of the basement section as\nwell as in breccia and interpillow material [Alt et\nal., 1998] and these brittle rock types are prefer-\nentially lost during drilling process [Brewer et al.,\n1998, 1999]. It follows that average K2O content of\nthe cores will be underestimated if the core-derived\nproportions of the different rock types are used.\n[32] It should be also noted, that some cores show\naverage K2O contents derived from the chemical\nanalyses that are higher than the K2O content\nreported by the logging tool (Figure 9a). This can\nbe observed on both sets of calculations, using either\ncore-derived or log-derived proportions and cannot\nbe related to a bias in the lithological proportions. It\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 rE\u00b4villon et al.: inputs to subduction zones 10.1029\/2002GC000344\n15 of 22\ntherefore must reflect a difference in the absolute\nK2O content measured by the gamma ray tool and\nthe chemical analyses. In this case, the question is\nwhether the gamma ray logging tool underestimate\nthe potassium content in the section or if the K2O\ncontents measured on discrete samples and used for\na specific lithology are an overestimation.\n[33] Some samples, mainly breccia, display higher\nK2O contents than measured by the logging tool,\nFigure 9. Plot of the average (a) K2O (wt.%) content per core derived from the geochemical analyses versus the\nK2O (wt.%) content per core derived from the gamma ray logging tool measurements and (b) U (ppm) content per\ncore derived from the geochemical analyses versus the U (ppm) content per core derived from the gamma ray logging\ntool measurements. Each data point is representative of a core. The blue squares were calculated using the rock types\nproportions derived from the recovered cores and the pink circles were calculated using the lithology proportions\nderived from the core-log integration study. The yellow triangles reported on Figure 9a were calculated using the\ncore-derived proportions and the MST-NGR data collected during Leg 185.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 rE\u00b4villon et al.: inputs to subduction zones 10.1029\/2002GC000344\n16 of 22\nalthough the gamma ray curve does show peaks for\nthese intervals (Figure 10, samples 185-801C-\n15R1-19-23 and 16R2-27-31, see also Figure 6).\nThese samples comprise a matrix composed of\nhighly altered basalt, carbonates, celadonite and\nclay minerals, preferentially enriched in K2O, and a\nsmall proportion of basalt clasts. In contrast, the\nthird breccia sample (Figure 9, 185-801C-16R5-\n62-65) is mainly composed of basaltic clasts (90%)\nwith only a small amount of matrix and its K2O\ncontent is in close agreement with the tool meas-\nurement. This difference can either be related to the\nlogging tool itself, which measures the gamma ray\ncounts over a larger volume than the analysed\nsample or to the samples themselves. Some breccia\nand pillow basalts samples have extreme compo-\nsitions and are probably not highly representative\nof the overall composition of these rock types in\n600\n605\n610\n615\n620\n625\n630\n635\n640\n0 1 2 3 4\nD\ne\np\nth\n (\nm\nb\nsf\n)\nK2O (%) \nBreccia\nPillow basalt\nMassive basalt\nInterpillow sediment\nHydrothermal units\n185-801C\n15R1-19-23\n185-801C\n16R2-27-31\n185-801C\n16R5-62-65\nFigure 10.

Other samples, in which\nbasalt and matrix proportions are less extreme,\nare probably more representative of the overall\ncomposition (Figure 10). This can explain most\nof the differences observed between the chemical\nanalyses and the gamma ray data for the pillow\nbasalts, sediments and breccias (Figure 6). Despite\nuncertainties related to the radius of investigation\nof the tool and its averaging effect, this indicates\nthat the gamma ray tool is well calibrated in base-\nment sections and logging data can be used to\naccurately estimate the overall K2O content in a\nborehole.\n[34] The same features, as for K2O, can be observed\non the U calculations (Figure 9b). The average\ncompositions per core calculated using core-\nderived proportions are slightly more scattered than\nthose calculated using log-derived proportions. The\nlatter also plot close to the one to one line (Figure\n9b) and also demonstrate the reliability of the\nmethod. The concentrations calculated using the\ncore-derived proportions are also slightly lower\nthan the others and indicate the same bias toward\nU-rich lithologies, as observed on the K2O calcu-\nlations. The bias toward high concentrations\nobserved for K2O is not observed for U (Figure\n9b, see also Figure 7). A ready explanation to this is\nfound in the small contrasts in U concentrations\nbetween the different lithologies. The range of U\nconcentrations in all lithologies are comparable and\nno extreme compositions are found in contrast to\nthe K2O data. The sample data are therefore prob-\nably more representative of the different lithologies.\nWe can conclude that the gamma ray tool is also\nfairly well calibrated and that U data can be used as\na further constraint on the chemical composition of\na basement section.\n[35] Despite relatively large errors on the calcula-\ntions (up to 20%), mainly dependent on our ability\nto interpret the logging data and to recognise the\nmissing lithologies, our results show that this\nmethod can be used with confidence to estimate\nthe K2O and U contents of a basement section.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the logging data\nare well calibrated and these results can be directly\nused to estimate the composition of the altered\ncrust in term of K and U.\n[36] This method also highlights the difficulty of\nchoosing representative samples to use in a \u2018\u2018com-\nposite\u2019\u2019 sample method. A major approach of ODP\nLeg 185 is to use such samples, which are a\nphysical mixture of different rock types [Staudigel\net al., 1996; Plank et al., 2000] to estimate the\noverall composition of the basement recycled in the\nMarianna subduction zone. The principal difficulty\nwhen preparing these composites will be first to\nchoose the appropriate samples and then to choose\nin which proportions to mix them. If the samples are\nnot representative of each rock type, but have\nextreme compositions, then neither of the core-\nderived or log-derived proportions will be repre-\nsentative. This is particularly critical for high K\nlithologies like breccia samples. Using the core-\nderived proportions may result in an underestima-\ntion of the concentrations but the use of log-derived\nproportions may also entrain an overestimation of\nthe concentrations in the basement. However, the\ncore-log-geochemical integration method is only\napplicable, so far, to two chemical elements, K\nand U in contrast to the composite sample approach\nwhich allow to analyse all the chemical elements as\nwell as isotope compositions. A combination of\nthese two methods is required to fully estimate the\ncomposition of the oceanic crust. This can be\nundertaken if samples are chosen to be representa-\ntive of an average rock type by checking their\ncomposition against logging data and if enough\nsamples of each rock type are analysed such that\nthe range in composition is accurately represented.\nIn this case, the log-derived proportions should be\nused to prepare the composite.\n5.2. Oceanic Crust Composition and\nImpact on Flux Calculations\n[37] The calculations performed enable average\nK2O and U contents for the basement section\ndrilled at Hole 801C to be calculated (Table 3).\nThese estimates are important both for our under-\nstanding of the average composition of altered\noceanic crust and in term of chemical fluxes\nrecycled into subduction zones. For these two\npurposes we used two different estimates of the\ndrilled section at Hole 801C. The upper alkali\nsection is younger than the tholeiitic section and\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 rE\u00b4villon et al.: inputs to subduction zones 10.1029\/2002GC000344\n18 of 22\nmay results from off axis magmatism. We therefore\nconsidered that only the tholeiitic section recovered\nwas representative of a \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 oceanic crust and\ncould therefore be used to estimate the average\ncomposition of altered oceanic crust. On the other\nhand, to calculate the chemical fluxes recycled into\nthe Marianna subduction zone we integrated the\nalkali basalts into the calculations as both these\nsections are to be subducted.\n5.2.1. Composition of the Altered Oceanic\nCrust\n[38] Previous calculations using NGT and MST-\nNGR data indicate average K2O concentrations of\n0.36 wt.% and 0.31 wt.% respectively for the\ntholeiitic section [Plank et al., 2000]. We used\nthe average core compositions (Table 2) to calcu-\nlate new average K2O and U contents for the\ntholeiitic sequence of Hole 801C (Table 3). The\nconcentrations extracted from the gamma ray data\nvalues and calculated with the log-derived propor-\ntions are in very good agreement with respectively\n0.35 wt.% and 0.36 wt.% for K2O and 0.41 ppm\nand 0.33 ppm for U. Both K2O and U concen-\ntrations calculated with the core-derived propor-\ntions are lower than those extracted from the\ngamma ray data or calculated with the log-derived\nproportions as well as K2O concentrations calcu-\nlated using average MST-NGR data (Table 3). As\nnoticed before, the altered lithologies, such as\nbreccia, are preferentially lost during the drilling\nand using core-derived proportions results in an\nunderestimation of these rock types and an under-\nestimation of the overall K and U contents down-\nhole. The difference in average K2O and U\ncontents for the tholeiitic section is however rela-\ntively small given the errors associated with the\nvarious type of calculation (0.30 vs. 0.36 wt.% for\nK2O and 0.30 vs. 0.33 ppm for U, Table 3).\n[39] Overall, our results indicate that average\nK2O content of altered oceanic crust is slightly\nhigher than estimated from core-only geochemical\ncalculations. More importantly, these values are\ndifferent than those measured on the composite\nsamples. The K2O content of the \u2018\u2018super compo-\nsite\u2019\u2019 sample prepared during Leg 185 is 0.62\nwt.% (Kelley et al., submitted manuscript, 2002),\nwhich is much higher than our estimates but is\ncomparable to the one reported for DSDP\/ODP\nSites 417 and 418 (K2O 0.56 wt.%, [Staudigel et\nal., 1996]). The difference is less significant in\nterm of U as the concentration of the \u2018\u2018super\ncomposite\u2019\u2019 sample is 0.39 ppm. These high\nvalues highlight the effects of choosing unrepre-\nsentative end-members samples with high K\ncontents, which disproportionably increase the\ncomposite concentrations.\n5.2.2. Recycled Crust Composition\n[40] To estimate the K and U budget recycled to\nthe Marianna subduction zone, the alkali upper\nsection of Hole 801C basement must be taken into\naccount as well as the tholeiitic section. We also\ncalculated average K2O and U concentrations for\nthe alkali section and for the all basement section\ncomprising the alkalic cap and the tholeiites of the\nlogged interval (Table 3).\nTable 3.

The tholeiite sequence is from core 4R to 39R (logged interval).\nb\nMST-NGR data from core 5R to 39R.\nc\n0.50 ppm represents the average of all U-gamma ray data over the logged interval while 0.42 ppm is the average of U-gamma ray data for the 15\ncores used in the calculations.\nd\nThese calculations comprise only core 2R.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 rE\u00b4villon et al.: inputs to subduction zones 10.1029\/2002GC000344\n19 of 22\n[41] Within the upper alkali section, the concentra-\ntion calculated with the core-derived proportions is\nhigher than the one derived from the logs or calcu-\nlated from the log-derived proportions (Table 3).\nAbout 30% of the material was not recovered in this\ninterval, and is interpreted as a mixture of pillows\nbasalts and breccia. As the massive alkali basalts\nhave higher K contents compared to pillow basalts\nand breccia, the average content of the sequence is\nlowered when using the log-derived proportions. All\nthe average U concentrations calculated for the\nalkali sections are in good agreement. It should be\nnoted, however, that these calculations comprise\nonly one core (Table 3) and it is therefore difficult\nto extrapolate to the all section. For the all logged\nsection (tholeiite + alkali basalts), the concentrations\ncalculated using the core-derived proportions are\nlower than those calculated using both the log-\nderived proportions and the gamma ray data (0.34\nwt.% vs. 0.51 wt.% and 0.47 wt.% respectively for\nK2O and 0.34 ppm vs. 0.39 and 0.42\u20130.50 ppm\nrespectively for U, Table 3).\n[42] Although the difference induced by the recov-\nery was small for the tholeiite section, the differ-\nence for the all basement is more significant. It\nshows that the use of core-derived proportions only\nmay induce a bias of 20\u201350% in our estimates of\nthe composition of the recycled crust.\n[43] These results have significant implications for\nK and U budgets recycled into subduction zones.\nFor the Marianna subduction zone a convergence\nrate of 4.75 cm\/yr, over 2000 km can be assumed\n[Plank et al., 2000]. Assuming an average density\nof 2.9 g\/cm3 for the upper 500 m of oceanic crust,\nabout 1.4 104 g\/yr are recycled. From our calcu-\nlations, the associated K fluxes are 3.8 103 g\/yr\nusing the core-derived proportions and 5.8 103 g\/yr\nusing the log-derived proportions. The U fluxes\ncalculated in the same manner are respectively 4.7\n10\u00023 g\/yr and 5.4 10\u00023 g\/yr. K and U fluxes\nrecycled into the subduction zone could therefore\nbe higher than previously estimated, up to 20\u201350%\nfor K and 10\u201320% for U. These results can also\nhave strong implications for chemical fluxes\nbetween the altered oceanic crust and seawater\nand further work is needed to extend this approach\nand combine it to a composite sample approach to\naccess more chemical elements as well as the\nisotope compositions.\n6. Conclusion\n[44] In this paper we present a new approach to\nestimate the average composition of a drilled\nsection by integrating core data, gamma ray wire\nline logging data and geochemical data. At ODP\nSite 801C a detailed core-log integration study was\nperformed [Barr et al., 2002], which allowed\nreconstruction of the complete basement stratigra-\nphy. The FMS images together with other wire line\nlogging data and images of the recovered cores\nwere used to relocate the samples. We then calcu-\nlated average K2O and U contents of each core\nusing the core-derived and log-derived rock types\nproportions and we compared them to the logging\ndata. This approach have allowed us to demon-\nstrate that the gamma ray tool (HNGS) is well\ncalibrated against chemical analyses and MST-\nNGR data and enable to accurately determine the\nK2O and U concentrations downhole. By using the\nwire line log-derived proportions we can account\nfor the more strongly altered, K2O and U-rich\nmaterial, which is preferentially lost during drill-\ning. The calculations undertaken in this study\nindicate that logging data are reliable enough to\nbe used as a proxy for the K2O and U concen-\ntrations of a borehole. We demonstrate that K and\nU fluxes are higher when log-derived proportions\nor gamma ray data are used instead of expanded\ncore-derived proportions. The calculated fluxes are\n20\u201350% higher for K and 10\u201320% higher for U.\n[45] Our results indicate that K2O concentrations\nand to a lesser extent U concentrations can be\noverestimated because inappropriate samples with\nextreme end-member compositions are often used.\nComposite samples should be prepared with ex-\ntreme caution and this preparation integrated with\nwire line logging data to ensure that appropriate,\nrepresentative samples of each rock type are com-\nbined in the correct, log-derived, proportions. In\norder to better constrain chemical fluxes between\nthe oceanic crust and seawater as well as recycled\ninto subduction zones, careful core-log-geochemi-\ncal integration studies are essential.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 rE\u00b4villon et al.: inputs to subduction zones 10.1029\/2002GC000344\n20 of 22\nAcknowledgments\n[46] Authors are grateful to K.
