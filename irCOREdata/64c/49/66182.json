It is shown that a lightly loaded, three-bladed\nrotor always has the potential to self start under steady wind conditions, whereas the starting\nof a two-bladed device is dependent upon its initial starting orientation.\nKeywords: vertical axis wind turbines, Darrieus, wind turbine, self-starting\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe use of wind turbines for small-scale and urban\napplications is a topic that is receiving increasing\nattention. The relative merits of different turbine\nconfigurations, both vertical and horizontal axes,\nhave been widely discussed and well summarized\nby many authors [1, 2]. The work presented here is\nfocused upon the Darrieus-type vertical axis\nmachine. For small-scale applications, simplicity\nand low cost are of primary importance and in this\nregard, the Darrieus machine offers some distinct\nadvantages relative to horizontal axis turbines,\nincluding accessible systems (often located at or\nclose to the ground), low noise, and potentially\nsimple blade design. Acknowledged disadvantages\ninclude the magnitude, location, and orientation\nof the peak blade stresses, the lack of an inherent\nblade speed limit which adds further complication\nto the stress problem, and lower efficiency than\ncomparable axial machines although some would\nargue with the latter statement [2]. For domestic\nand small industrial applications, the issues of\nblade loading are relatively easily managed and effi-\nciency, if it is indeed an issue, is of less importance\nthan simplicity, cost, and reliability. Of potentially\ngreater importance is the starting capability of\nthese devices. Some researchers including Kentfield\n[3] have stated that the Darrieus turbine is inher-\nently non self-starting whereas others have quali-\nfied this by stating that variable geometry or very\ncareful aerofoil selection is required to promote\nself-starting [1, 2]. For small-scale devices, a self-\nstarting capability under typical wind conditions is\nessential and it is the investigation and numerical\nsimulation of the physics of self-starting that is the\nfocus of this study.\n1.1 Self-starting\nThe term self-starting needs to be defined carefully.\nEbert and Wood [4] define the starting process as\nhaving been completed when significant power\nextraction commences, and Kirke [1] deems a tur-\nbine to be self-starting only if it can accelerate\nfrom rest to the point where it starts to produce a\n\u0001Corresponding author: School of Engineering, University\nof Durham, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, UK. e-mail:\nr.g.dominy@durham.ac.uk\n111\nJPE340 # IMechE 2007 Proc. IMechE Vol. 221 Part A: J. Power and Energy\nuseful output. In both cases, the definitions of the\nterms \u2018significant power\u2019 and \u2018useful output\u2019 are\nthemselves imprecise. Others (e.g. Lunt [5]) have\nadopted a more specific definition by which a\nmachine is deemed to have started if it has acceler-\nated from rest to a condition where the blades oper-\nate at a steady speed that exceeds the wind speed\n(i.e. the tip speed ratio, TSR . 1). The basis of this\ndefinition is that to exceed a TSR of 1.0, the turbine\ncan no longer be operating entirely as a drag device\n(a device in which the maximum blade speed\ncannot exceed the wind speed in the manner of a\nSavonius rotor) but that significant lift must be pro-\nduced during the rotational cycle. Although more\nprecise, this definition also has its limitations. In\nparticular, there is evidence that reaching the\npoint at which the blades begin to produce lift\nover a significant part of a revolution does not\nguarantee that the machine will to continue to\naccelerate. Baker [6] describes a dead band that\nmay extend to TSR\u2019s in excess of 2 in which there\nis insufficient or even negative torque that prevents\nfurther acceleration. He argues that when operating\nin this zone, only if the wind suddenly drops while\nthe rotor inertia maintains its rotational speed can\nthe tip speed ratio reach a value that is sufficient\nto drive the machine to a fully lifting state. The\nimplication of this statement is that significant\natmospheric wind transients are required to com-\nplete the self-starting process for a fixed-blade\nDarrieus turbine. The evidence that a Darrieus tur-\nbine using fixed geometry, symmetrical aerofoil\nblades cannot self-start would therefore seem com-\npelling were it not for the many, but usually unsub-\nstantiated, observations that devices of precisely\nthis configuration do self-start in the field. In some\nof these cases, it may be that self-starting was\ninduced by atmospheric gusting but that would\nnot appear to be true in all cases. Whether a particu-\nlar design self-starts will depend not only upon its\naerodynamic performance but also upon the\ncharacteristics of any driven load and there seems\nto have been no systematic approach to the analysis\nof the aerodynamic characteristics of turbines in\nisolation from their resistive loads. Only when these\nfactors are understood individually can the matching\nof a turbine and its load be performed effectively.\nThe purpose of this study is therefore to determine\nthe fundamental physics associatedwith the starting\nprocess and to demonstrate conclusively whether, in\nprinciple, a simple Darrieus device is capable of self-\nstarting. To achieve these objectives, a compu-\ntational model has been developed to analyse the\nrotor performance from the moment it is released\nuntil a steady-state condition is achieved whether\nor not that condition provides useful torque. The\nmodel has been validated against published data\nand against observations from a small-scale wind\ntunnel model of a three-bladed Darrieus turbine.\n1.2 Aerofoil performance characteristics\nTo understand the performance of the turbine, it is\nhelpful to consider an individual aerofoil operating\nthrough one or more complete revolutions. The gen-\neric velocity vectors for an aerofoil operating at inci-\ndence are well known and apply to any moving\naerofoil whether in isolation or as one of a set of\nblades in a turbine or cascade (Fig. 1). For most\napplications, an aerofoil is expected to operate in\nan unstalled condition and the relative incidence\nvaries over only a few degrees even when operating\noff-design. However, for a vertical axis wind turbines\n(VAWT), the incidence initially changes through 3608\nduring the single revolution of an individual blade\nand only when the blade speed exceeds the wind\nspeed is this range reduced. The VAWT, therefore,\nexperiences incidences that are more extreme than\nthose experienced by almost any other aerofoil appli-\ncation under normal operating conditions.\nTo analyse the blade forces and hence the torque\nand power of the machine, it is necessary to know\nthe lift and drag characteristics of its blades over\nthe full incidence range. Such data are scarce; the\nmost complete set arising from the work performed\nat the Sandia National Laboratories during the 1970s\nand 1980s, notably by Sheldahl and Klimas [7].\nFor the purpose of the analysis presented here, the\nsymmetrical NACA 0012 aerofoil was chosen primar-\nily because of its wide use for VAWT research. Most\nearly Darrieus devices made use of NACA 0012 or\n0015 sections although more recently some studies\nhave indicated that performance advantage can be\ngained through the use of novel aerofoil shapes [1].\nIn the absence of explicit rules for the selection of\naerofoils for Darrieus turbines, the NACA 0012 aero-\nfoil was considered to be appropriate for this study.\nThe complete lift and drag characteristics of this\naerofoil are summarized in Fig. 2 for a range of\nFig. 1 Generic blade velocity triangle for a VAWT\n112 R Dominy, P Lunt, A Bickerdyke, and J Dominy\nProc. IMechE Vol. 221 Part A: J. Power and Energy JPE340 # IMechE 2007\nReynolds numbers that might be experienced during\nthe operation of a \u2018small\u2019 VAWT in typical wind con-\nditions (,10 m\/s). For the purpose of this study, a\nsmall VAWT is defined as having a nominal power\nrating of ,2.5 kW. In view of the shortage of data\nfor this or any other aerofoil section in the stalled\nregion, it is useful to make a comparison between\nthe Sheldahl and Klimas [7] data and that of others\nin the more widely investigated unstalled and just\npost-stalled zone in order to gain confidence in\nthat data (Fig. 3). However, such a comparison\ncasts some doubt on the accuracy of the Sheldahl\nand Klimas [7] data in this region, and hence there\nmust also be some uncertainty over the stalled\nzone data, but in the absence of a more reliable\nalternative most previous analysis has been based\nupon their unique data set. For this reason, new\nmeasurements were made at Durham University to\ninvestigate the aerodynamic performance of this\nand other aerofoils over the full incidence range.\nOnly the NACA 0012 data are presented here and it\nis these data that have been used for the predictions\nof turbine startup performance (Fig. 4). The aerofoil\nhad a chord of 0.15 m and a span of 0.45 m resulting\nin tested Reynolds numbers of up to 2 \u0002 105. The\nblade tips extended to the side walls of the wind\ntunnel to eliminate tip leakage and hence the data\napproximate to a two-dimensional test case. The\ndata of Sheldahl and Klimas suggest that Reynolds\nnumber effects are negligible in all but a small\nrange of incidence close to and shortly after stall\n(Fig. 2). During start up, the blades operate at these\ncritical incidences for only a very small time and\nhence as an acceptable approximation the startup\nperformance has been analysed on the basis of the\naerodynamic data derived from tests made at a\nsingle Reynolds number (1.7 \u0002 105).\n2 PERFORMANCE MODELLING\nModelling of the overall turbine performance was\nbased on a time-stepping approach. For any initial,\nuser-defined blade starting position, wind speed,\nand angular velocity, the resulting velocity triangle\ndetermines the relative airspeed and blade incidence\nfor each blade. The lift and drag coefficients are\nfound for this incidence by interpolation from a\nlook-up table based on the blade aerodynamic data-\nbase and hence the absolute forces are easily deter-\nmined for the chosen aerofoil dimensions. For this\nstudy, no tip effects have been considered but the\naspect ratio is high (span\/chord \u00bc 13.3) so tip effects\nwould not be expected to have a significant impact\non the flow physics associated with startup.\nOnce the blade forces have been determined, the\nforces are resolved in the circumferential direction\nin order to establish the instantaneous torque and\nFig. 3 Comparison of published NACA 0012 lift\ncoefficient data\nFig. 4 Lift and drag coefficients for the NACA 0012 at\nRe \u00bc 1.65 \u0002 105\nFig. 2 NACA0012 lift and drag coefficients at three\nReynolds numbers (data from reference [7])\nSelf-starting capability of a Darrieus turbine 113\nJPE340 # IMechE 2007 Proc. IMechE Vol. 221 Part A: J. Power and Energy\npower. Knowing the inertial characteristics of the\nmachine together with any resistance due to the\nbearing friction and generator load characteristics,\nthe instantaneous acceleration of the rotor is calcu-\nlated and applied over a short time interval to deter-\nmine a new rotor position from which the process is\nrepeated. The information from each time step is\nstored to allow a complete mapping of the time his-\ntory of each variable included in the calculation. As\nlong as the time increment is small in comparison\nto the changes of speed and acceleration, the time\nstepping approach provides an accurate model of\nthe device. For multi-bladed machines, it is a\nsimple task to sum the effects of each individual\nblade. For this work, a time increment of 0.001 s\nwas used but such is the speed of even modest desk-\ntop PCs that much smaller periods can be used if\nrequired. A preliminary analysis of the results pre-\nsented here confirmed that reducing the period by\nan order of magnitude had no significant effect and\nhence the larger interval was adopted to keep the\nsize of the data set within acceptable bounds. In\nthe absence of any directly relevant data, the\nimpact of the wake generated by an upstream blade\non its downstream neighbours was not considered\nduring the course of this initial study.\n3 RESULTS\nTable 1 provides a summary of the geometric and\nnumerical parameters used for this study. The tur-\nbine represents a potential domestic or light indus-\ntrial unit rated at approximately 2.5 kW. The notation\nthat is used for geometrical definitions and sign con-\nvention is shown in Fig. 5.\n3.1 Single-bladed rotor\nInitially, the starting characteristics of a single-bladed\nrotor are considered. Although this configuration is\nunlikely to be used for a practical machine,\nit provides a valuable tool to aid the visualization and\nexplanation of the processes involved during startup.\nFigure 6 shows the time history of the blade vel-\nocity based on a constant free stream wind speed\nof 10 m\/s and an initial blade velocity of zero which\nrepresents the point at which any brake or locking\nmechanism is released. For this demonstration, the\ninitial blade incidence was 458 at a starting position\nof 3p\/4.\nIn this instantaneous starting situation, although\nstalled, the circumferential component of lift is suffi-\ncient to accelerate the rotor forwards. Although the\naerodynamic forces fluctuate as the rotor rotates\nand the blade incidence changes the rotor is able to\nmaintain a continuous acceleration until it reaches\na tip speed ratio of approximately 3.9.\nEven at this apparently steady-state operation,\nthere are very considerable torque variations\naround the cycle (Fig. 7(a)) which correspond to\nthe blade incidence changes that occur (Fig. 7(b))\nand to the corresponding variation of blade lift,\ndrag, and net tangential force component\n(Fig. 7(c)). It should be noted that once a nominally\nsteady-state condition has been achieved, the blade\nincidence never exceeds +0.25 rad (14.38) and thus\nit remains unstalled. The choice of a 0.001 s time\ninterval is not sufficiently small to capture exactly\nthe true periodicity of the solution (most noticeable\nin Fig. 7(c)) but the observed error has little impact\nupon the essential characteristics and is only notice-\nable at the high tip speed ratios associated with a tur-\nbine in \u2018lift mode\u2019.\nThe aerofoil data of Sheldahl (Fig. 2) and those pre-\nsented here (Fig. 4) show that the lift characteristics\nof the aerofoil are qualitatively similar whether it is\nmoving into the wind (08\u2013908) or away from the\nwind (1808\u2013908). However, the drag is higher when\nreversed. Consequently, if the starting position is\nadvanced through 908, the tangential component\nof the drag is greater than the corresponding lift\ncomponent and the blade therefore starts to move\nforwards, away from the wind (Fig. 8).\nTable 1 Simulation parameters\nData for NACA 0012 Other physical constants\nChord, c 0.15 m Radius of\nrotation, R\n1.20 m\nSpan, s 2.00 m Air density, r 1.20 kg\/m23\nMass, m 3 kg (each\nblade)\nWind speed, V 10 m\/s\nFig. 5 Sign convention\n114 R Dominy, P Lunt, A Bickerdyke, and J Dominy\nProc.

IMechE Vol. 221 Part A: J. Power and Energy\nAs it progresses into the next quadrant, the tangen-\ntial components of both the lift and the drag lift act in\nthe same direction, thus further advancing the blade,\nbut as the 2p\/2 position is approached those com-\nponents approach zero, and as the blade passes into\nthe third quadrant, both are reversed in direction\nthus beginning to slow the blade until at a position\nof approximately23p\/2 the blade motion is reversed.\nThe blade does not return exactly to its initial starting\nposition but moves through that position before stop-\nping just a few degrees past it and reversing once\nagain and repeating the cycle. However, the different\nstarting position leads to a slightly exaggerated\nmotion which grows each time it is repeated until\nafter six cycles the motion is sufficient to carry the\nblade into the fourth quadrant. The significance of\nthis is that the tangential component of the lift again\nacts in the forward direction, causing the blade to\ncomplete the revolution and allowing the turbine to\naccelerate quickly to its continuous operating con-\ndition, once again with a mean tip speed ratio of 3.9.\nA third case of interest is where the blade lies\ninitially across the wind at 2p\/2. If the forward and\nrearward halves of the aerofoil were symmetrical,\nthere would be no net tangential force and the blade\nwould remain in this stable position. For conventional\naerofoil shapes, such as the NACA 0012, the asymme-\ntry results in a small tangential force that moves the\nblade very slowly backwards. Any small change of pos-\nition is sufficient to create a restoring force thatmoves\nthe blade back, slightly past its initial position until the\nforce is again reversed. This \u2018rocking\u2019 back and forth\ncontinues indefinitely and provides a low amplitude,\nperiodic but essentially stable condition (Fig. 9).\nFig. 9 Change of blade position with time (single blade; 2p\/2 starting position)\nFig. 8 Change of blade speed with time (single blade; \u00fep\/4 starting position)\n116 R Dominy, P Lunt, A Bickerdyke, and J Dominy\nProc.

This shows the startup time for each con-\nfiguration against the starting position of the nom-\ninal \u2018primary\u2019 blade. A cut-off time of 300 s has\nbeen adopted on the basis that a machine that has\nnot self-started by then is unlikely to do so and\nwould certainly not be suitable for commercial\noperation.\nIt may be observed that the three-bladed rotor self-\nstarts under all conditions at the datum wind speed\nof 10 m\/s and that under a broad range of conditions\nits starting is almost instantaneous. The two-bladed\nrotor also self-starts under all conditions but there\nare four zones (approximately 08, 908, 1808, and\n2708) where the capability to self-start is marginal\nincluding two (1758, 3558) that could be particularly\nproblematic in a commercial device. Natural ambi-\nent turbulence may be sufficient to reduce these\nzones but, as yet, there is no experimental data to\nconfirm this hypothesis. There are large zones in\nwhich the single-bladed rotor cannot self-start but\nthis is not particularly surprising and it should be\nnoted the starting times for this device have been\nincluded only to assist with the analysis of startup\nmechanisms and not as an analysis of a practical\nmachine.\nFig. 12 Three-bladed rotor starting behaviour\nFig. 13 Time to startup for a one-, two-, and three-bladed rotor from different starting positions\n118 R Dominy, P Lunt, A Bickerdyke, and J Dominy\nProc.

The most useful is that\nof Chua [8] who provides a time history of rotor\nspeed for a three-bladed machine. A detailed specifi-\ncation of the device was not provided by the author\nand the results can therefore only be used qualitat-\nively but the comparison with normalized data gen-\nerated using the model described here is highly\nencouraging (Fig. 14).\nFurther qualitative validation is provided by exper-\niments that have been conducted on a smaller-scale\nbut geometrically similar machine manufactured by\nCarbon Concepts Ltd. A sequence of photographs\n(Fig. 15) demonstrates the transition from a drag\nmachine to a lift device during the starting process\nthrough the use of streamers attached to the upper\nblade tips. In Fig. 15(a), it is seen that blade 1 (left\nhand side of the photograph) is operating with a\ncross-flow component of approximately 908. Blade 2\n(foreground) also experiences a cross-flow but at\nreduced incidence and blade 3 (right hand side) is\noperating in its lifting zone and it is this blade that\nprovides most of the drive. In Fig. 15(b), it is seen\nthat the rotor has accelerated such that two of the\nthree blades are operating in their unstalled, lifting\nmode with only blade 1 (left hand side) showing any\nsign of flow reversal. In Fig. 15(c), all three blades\nremain unstalled and in this mode the substantially\nhigher tip speed ratio results in some blurring of the\nimage but the streamers remain clearly visible.\nAll of the results that have been presented so far\nhave been based on a nominal wind speed of 10 m\/s.\nThis is above the average UK wind speed and if\nsmall wind turbines are to be widely adopted it is\nessential that they are able to provide power at\nlower wind speeds. Figure 16 shows the predicted\nstartup time required for a three-bladed rotor over\na range of wind speeds based on a starting position\nof u \u00bc p together with a line of best fit. It may be\nobserved that as the ambient wind speed falls, the\nstarting time increases but there is no discontinuity\nsuggesting that ultimately the machine has the\ncapacity to self-start over a very broad range of\nwind speeds. For all of the predictions presented\nhere it has been assumed that the rotor has been\nonly lightly loaded by the generator. This is not\nunreasonable since it is relatively simple to apply\nthe electrical load only when a nominally steady\nstate, lifting condition is reached. The introduction\nof the load would then influence the steady-state\ntip speed ratio and hence the power and torque gen-\neration but the fundamental aerodynamic starting\nprocess would be expected to remain unchanged.\n4 CONCLUSIONS\nThe startup and continuous operation of various\nconfigurations of VAWT have been successfully mod-\nelled and validated based on the use of the NACA\nFig. 14 Comparison between the normalized speed\/\ntime response of a real machine (unknown\nspecification) [8] with simulation (specification\napproximated)\nFig. 15 VAWT staring behaviour from fully stalled to fully unstalled\nSelf-starting capability of a Darrieus turbine 119\nJPE340 # IMechE 2007 Proc.

It has been shown that under lightly\nloaded conditions, two-bladed turbines have the\npotential to self-start but that the self-starting capa-\nbility does not extend to all possible starting pos-\nitions which could prove to be problematic for\ncommercial turbines. However, it has been shown\nthat a three-bladed rotor will self-start irrespective\nof its starting position. This has been confirmed by\ntests on a model turbine. It has also been shown\nthat the three-bladed turbine is able to self-start at\nwind speeds that are much lower than the datum\nspeed. It is therefore recommended that three-\nbladed designs should always be adopted in prefer-\nence to two-bladed rotors if reliable self-starting is\nrequired.\nREFERENCES\n1 Kirke, B. K.
