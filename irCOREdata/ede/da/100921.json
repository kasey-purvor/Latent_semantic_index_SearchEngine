We believe this is based on the substrate playing an\nimportant role in the emission process of diamond films. In\nfact, it has been observed that better emission results from\nchemical vapor deposited diamond films grown on SnO2 in-\nstead of silicon, suggesting that the electron supply layer or\nsubstrates plays an active role in the emission process.8\nHowever, despite the well-known attractive properties of dia-\nmond \u0001negative electron affinity, thermal, mechanical, and\nchemical inertness\u0002, there are still several problems in the\nproduction of field emission devices based on this material\nassociated with obtaining high current densities from emit-\nters, obtaining uniform microstructures, etc., which affect\nlong-term stability.9 In addition, diamond films, as well as\nother carbon materials which have been used for emission,\nare subject to thermal effects at the interface between the\nsubstrate and the carbon film. The presence of heating at the\ninterface of the film and substrate generates different me-\nchanical stresses on the film. This will increase the resistance\nand\/or the voltage barrier needed to maintain electron emis-\nsion at low voltages for an extended periods of time.\nIn order to circumvent the above problem, we present\nhere an approach based on a combination of carbon nano-\ntubes \u0001CNTs\u0002 and BDD films mounted on a carbon felt to\nobtain reproducible electron emission at low fields.

Redistribution subject tomounts on a carbon felt have previously been explored for\nelectrochemical applications.10,11 CNTs grown on BDD\nfilms, as described in this letter, is a further interesting tech-\nnique to increase its potential uses.\nThe felt substrate was obtained from carbonization of\npolyacrinitrile at 2000 \u00b0C. The obtained carbon fibers have a\ndiameter of around 10 \u0001m and resistivity equal to\n0.96 \u0002 cm\u22121 \u0001determined by the four-probe method\u0002. BDD\nfilms with acceptor concentrations of about 1.5\u00031021 cm\u22123\nwere then grown by the hot filament chemical vapor deposi-\ntion \u0001HFCVD\u0002 method as described in literature.9,10 The Ra-\nman spectra of polycrystalline BDD films studied in the\npresent letter are identical to those found in Ref. 10, which\nshows diamond grains with only sp3 hybridization. The\nCNTs were grown on each BDD\/carbon fiber using methanol\nvapor. The catalysts were a mixture of cobalt and manga-\nnese. These samples were dispersed on BDD\/carbon fiber by\nimmersion of the BDD\/felt substrate in an ethanol solution\nFIG. 1.

The tempera-\nture and time of CNT growth was 650 \u00b0C and 20 min, re-\nspectively. N2 was used as the carrier gas for methanol vapor\nat a constant flow rate of 0.2 ml min\u22121.\nFigure 1 shows scanning electron microscopy \u0001SEM\u0002\nimages from the CNT\/BDD\/felt electrodes, the polycrystal-\nline BDD film, and the CNT grown on BDD film on a single\nfiber. The BDD film covered the whole fiber in the felt and\nthe CNT was then grown over the surface of the BDD film.\nThe micrographs show that the CNT growth occurs at the\nboundary between the grains as well as on the face of each\nBDD crystal. This suggests that the BDD films \u0001or substrate\u0002\nshould not have a major influence on the type of\nCNT growth resulting from the catalytic decomposition of\nmethanol.\nIndeed, the catalytic particles were observed at the tip of\nthe tubes. If we consider previous studies on the growth of\nCNT on zeolite and NaCl, with different catalyst using simi-\nlar CNT growth conditions as those employed in this study,\nthe CNTs on BDD films should produce a structure similar to\nbamboo or cup stacked in nature. In our studies, we found\nmultiwalled nanotubes which have a correlation between the\nFIG. 2.

The\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject todimension of the catalytic particles at the boundary of dia-\nmond grains and face were different. Thus, the CNT on BDD\nfilms may be a mixture of bamboolike, cup stacked, or sim-\nply disordered multiwalled CNTs.\nFigure 2 shows the variation of current versus voltage\n\u0001I-V\u0002 curves for the compound fibers of electrodes in contact\nwith a tungsten probe inside an SEM microscope. In this\nsetup, the felt was grounded using a silver epoxy and the\ncurrent measured was not associated with a single fiber. Be-\nsides this, the curves have the same profile and all electrodes\nshow high electronic conductivity. This allows one to infer\nthat adherence of the BDD to the felt is very good. It also\npoints to a well-adhered CNT deposit on BDD films, i.e., the\nresistance at the several interfaces of our compound is very\nlow. As a consequence, the Joule heating at these interfaces\nis expected to be low.\nTypical field emission I-V curves for the BBD\/felt and\nCNT\/BDD\/felt electrodes are shown in Fig. 3. All felt elec-\ntrode I-V curves were collected using a stainless-steel sphere\nanode \u00015 mm diameter\u0002, and the composite carbon and felt\nelectrode samples were of dimensions 0.8\u00030.8 cm2 with a\nthickness of 0.5 cm. The vacuum chamber was evacuated to\nabout 2\u000310\u22126 Torr prior to electron emission testing, and\nthe electrical contact of the CNT-felt was conducted using a\nthin layer of silver epoxy. The gap between the sphere and\nCNT-felt was control by an automated translator with a step-\nper motor. The BDD\/felt is capable of emitting 1 nA at a\nmacroscopic field of 2.2 V \u0001m\u22121, while the CNT\/BDD\/felt\nemits electrons at 1.1 V \u0001m\u22121 at the same separation dis-\ntance from the anode. The turn-on fields for current at 10 \u0001A\nare typically around 1.5\u20133.4 V \u0001m\u22121. However, it is worth\nnoting that the effective geometric area used in the emission\nof the felt is very complex and difficult to determine for each\nfiber taking part in the electron emission process.\nFigure 3 also shows a small hysteresis effect on the\nI-V curves for the composite electrodes, i.e., the difference in\nthe applied fields between the upward and downward voltage\ncycles appear mainly at an I-V measurement distance of\n500 \u0001m. The results suggest that this hysteresis is associated\nFIG. 3.

Appl. Phys. Lett. 88, 083116 \u00022006\u0001distances. The presence of amorphous carbon or impurities\nare often said to be responsible for this hysteresis. Both I-V\ncurves increase monotonically with voltage, with the satura-\ntion occurring first for the BDD\/felt electrode. For the CNT\/\nBBD\/felt, the saturation seems to occur at higher fields than\nthe BDD\/felt. This result suggests that depending on the ap-\nplied field, the emission of the CNT\/BBD\/felt may be selec-\ntively chosen. At shorter gap separation distances, the emis-\nsion should be dominated by all forms of carbons of the\ncomposite electrode, while at larger separations the emission\nof the electrode should be predominantly influenced by the\nCNTs due to the higher-field enhancement factors of these\nstructures. The CNT\/BBD\/felt appears thus very efficient for\nemission. This combination was able to provide a variation\nin the I-V curves that is similar to that observed for single-\nwall CNTs, where the I-V curves are found to have a sharp\nrise in emission after the threshold field Eth.6,11\nFinally, Fig. 4 shows the behavior of emission current\nversus time for CNT\/BDD\/felt at two different fields. The\nvoltage was applied without any previous voltage scans on\nthe electrodes. The CNT\/BDD\/felt shows small fluctuations\nduring the first 3 h of the emission, and then stabilized at\n0.2 \u0001A at 2.1 V \u0001m\u22121.

Redistribution subject toroom atmosphere. For a field of 4 V \u0001m\u22121, the electrode\nemitted about 2 \u0001A with good stability. The absence of fluc-\ntuations in Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002 suggests that this observed variation is\nassociated with some kind of degradation of the CNTs and\/or\nformation of amorphous carbon.\nIn conclusion, this letter shows the CNT\/BDD\/felt elec-\ntrode to be an excellent field emission electrode. This com-\nposite electrode has good mechanical properties and can be\nsubject to chemical treatments without significant lost of\nCNTs. The CNT\/BDD\/felt is able to emit electrons at volt-\nages in the range of 100\u20131500 microns at threshold fields\nthat appear smaller than the most of flat multiwall or single-\nwall CNT electrodes prepared at the present time. This ex-\ncellent performance is associated with several factors. The\nfirst is due the capacity of the felt substrate to mount large\namounts of BDD films and CNTs on the emission area. An-\nother important factor is the low resistance of the electrode.\nPoor electrical contact resulting from low adherence of CNTs\nor diamond to substrates generally results in a Joule effect\nthat will provoke degradation or failure of emission. In this\nnew approach, the resistance between the CNT-carbon is\nsmaller than CNT-Si or CNT-metal. Third, is the combina-\ntion of materials that are capable of emitting together and\/or\nto act as a channel for emission of electrons, i.e., BDD film\nfor carbon fiber and CNT for the BDD film. We believe that\nthe carbon compound presented in this letter opens the door\nfor the development of alternative sources for generation of\nemission devices.\nSome authors \u0001J.M.R, S.T., and M.M.\u0002 thank CAPES\n\u0001BEX 0278\/04-1\u0002, CNPq, and FAPESP.
