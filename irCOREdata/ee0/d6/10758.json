Teaching of this subject however is challenging because of the difficulty of providing appropriate\nexamples in an academic environment. This paper describes a business game developed by a leading automotive components company. The objective of the game is to illustrate the benefits of reducing complexity within manufacturing systems in simplifying planning and control. The paper describes\nthe development process for the game and provides detailed playing instructions. Finally, the paper reviews the use of the game in both an industrial and an academic context.<\/dc:description><dc:description>Full-text of this article is available at http:\/\/www.ijee.dit.ie\/articles\/Vol17-6\/Ijee1197.pdf<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>Dublin Institute of Technology, Tempus Publications<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-10-14T13:44:36Z<\/dc:date><dc:type>Article<\/dc:type><dc:identifier>International journal of engineering education, 2001, vol. 17, no. 6, pp. 546-557<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0949-149X<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2173\/84231<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.ijee.dit.ie<\/dc:relation><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.ijee.dit.ie\/articles\/Vol17-6\/Ijee1197.pdf<\/dc:relation><\/oai_dc:dc><\/metadata><\/record>","journals":null,"language":null,"relations":["http:\/\/www.ijee.dit.ie","http:\/\/www.ijee.dit.ie\/articles\/Vol17-6\/Ijee1197.pdf"],"year":2009,"topics":[],"subject":["Article"],"fullText":""}
