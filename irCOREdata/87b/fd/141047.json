INTRODUCTION \n \nThe principal of the Rotating Biological Contactor (RBC) was first developed in the late \n1920\u2019s [1], however, it was not until the 1960\u2019s that the first commercial system was \ninstalled in West Germany [2,3]. Thereafter, the popularity of RBCs grew and they are \ncurrently operated across the globe. The RBC is primarily used for sewage treatment in \nsmall communities, though it is now being used for larger treatment operations. They \nconsist of discs attached together to form a media pack as illustrated in figure 1. An \noperational unit can be seen in figure 2. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the Rotating Biological Contactor \n \nWater level \nOne media pack \nMedia discs or panels \nThe discs, also referred to as media panels, are held within an enclosed basin and \nsubmerged by approximately 35 to 40% of the height. Wastewater passes through the \nbasin as the disks slowly rotate, exposing the biological growth (biomass) on the media \npanels alternately to the wastewater, and to the surrounding air [4]. Typically, a media \npack consisting of a collection of media panels represents one stage of the treatment \nprocess. The RBC can consist of up to four or six separate media packs depending upon \nthe population served and mechanical design. Media panels are fixed onto a main central \nshaft, either directly or with the aid of a support structure. The shaft is in turn supported \nby bearings and connected to a power unit. RBC units can range from 1.0 to 4.0 meters in \ndiameter, with shaft lengths of up to 10 meters. \n \nFigure 2 Rotating Biological Contactor (RBC) \n \nIn operation biomass attach to the surfaces of the media panels forming a slime layer. \nRotation ensures aerobic conditions are maintained for the survival of the biomass. \nOrganisms in the developed biomass remove both dissolved oxygen and organic \nmaterials from the wastewater, effectively cleaning the settled sewage. The depth to \nwhich the biomass can grow is controlled by the shearing action on the biomass as it \npasses through the wastewater. In a well-operated system there exists a continual cycle of \nfilm growth followed by biomass stripping [2].  \n \nThe commercial viability of RBC units in the 1960's and early 70's was deemed to be \nvery poor as flat expanded polystyrene sheets were being used for the media panels. With \nthe development of polymers came the introduction of thin, corrugated sheets of high-\ndensity polyethylene in 1970\u2019s. This meant that the available surface area over a given \nlength of shaft was increased dramatically, improving the performance of the RBC and its \nrelative cost effectiveness. As a result, installations of RBC\u2019s increased considerably, but \nwider applications were limited due to mechanical breakdowns. Suggestions for \novercoming such mechanical deficiencies have been detailed [4]. \n \n2. EVOLUTION OF THE MEDIA \n \nThe media panels on RBC units are designed to: \ni) provide as much surface area for biomass growth \nii) allow drainage of the sewage liquor as the panels emerge during rotation \niii) reduce drag and impact on the panels by ensuring easy entry into the liquor  \n \nIn addition to these performance-related requirements, the media design can reduce \npower unit requirements by reducing the drag within the liquor and the hydraulic lift. \nOver the last 30 years designers have continually increased the available surface area on \nthe media panels, thereby improving the operational performance of the unit over a given \nshaft length. All RBC media designs fall under two categories; Glass Reinforced Polymer \n(GRP) and high-density polypropylene media panels. \n \nThe earliest RBC units in the United Kingdom employed flat Glass Reinforced Polymer \n(GRP) circular disc panels, see figure 3. The design arrangement consisted of a GRP lay-\nup on the main shaft, thereby allowing the media panels to be cemented directly onto the \nshaft. Furthermore, adjacent panels were separated by plastic circular pieces placed on \naxial through-rods or stud, thereby fixing the distance between individual media panels, \ninsert figure 3. The through rods run along the length of the media pack. \n \nFigure 3 Straight GRP media panels: Layout \n \nThe earliest known application of high-density polymer media panels was a wire mesh \ndesign, see figure 4. This particular media arrangement employed a steel support \narrangement. Adjacent media panels were separated with plastic circular pieces placed on \nseveral axially located support through rods. The two media type configurations \ndiscussed above are the earliest known panels still operational today and is the starting \npoint as we trace the evolution of the media panel designs. \n  Figure 4 Plastic wire mesh media panel \n \n2.1 GRP media panels \n \nThe evolution of GRP media designs was based on increasing the available surface area \nfor a fixed diameter and length, and, at a reduced cost. The earliest attempts to increase \nthe media panel surface area on GRP panels involved molding fan shaped GRP discs \nmedia panels, see figure 5. This increased the available surface area relative to the flat \ndisc GRP panels. Adjacent panels were separated with plastic circular studs located on \nthrough rods that ran along the length of the media panel, see insert of figure 5. The \ndistance between the panels is set to ensure adequate space for growth and development \nof the biomass, and drainage of the liquor. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFigure 5 Fan shaped GRP media panels  \n \nTo further increase available surface area, corrugations of GRP disc panels were designed \nsee figure 6. This increased available surface area relative to the flat and fan shaped disc \nmedia panels. Adjacent media panels were separated by placing corrugations of adjacent \npanels at 90 degrees to each other, see insert of figure 6. This eliminated the need for \nthrough rods with circular studs that had been previous used for this purpose. This new \napproach resulted in a reduction of manufacturing and assembly time, and costs. \nHowever, the design is restricted to RBC\u2019s with diameters of 2 meters or less. \n \n \n \n Figure 6 Corrugated GRP media panels: Layout \n \nA distinct feature of GRP disc media panels is that it can be cemented directly onto the \nmain shaft.  The manufacture of GRP RBC\u2019s has ceased in the United Kingdom due to \ncost implications. Whilst GRP media panels were popular, they were expensive to \nmanufacture, and with the development of polymers came a cheaper alternative. \nFurthermore, GRP media panels loose mechanical strength due to water absorption. \nRegrettably, this type of degradation cannot be avoided; moreover, it is not possible to \nimprove the mechanical strength of these media panels. It is perhaps interesting to note \nthat those RBC\u2019s employing this type of media panel have shown evidence of what can \nonly be described as brittleness of the media, no doubt caused by water absorption. As \nthese panels cannot be strengthened, the only solution to their mechanical deficiencies is \nto replace the entire defective pack, or in some instances, the complete rotor. These are \nhigh cost solutions. \n \n \n \n \n \n2.1.1 Mechanical deficiencies of GRP media panels \n \n \nDegradation of GRP media panels results in disintegration and breakage. The former is \nthe most severe form of damage and leads to loss of available surface area and a \nreduction in operational performance.  A severe case of disintegration caused by \nhydrolysis is shown in figures 7 and 8. Early \u2018tell-tale\u2019 signs of media disintegration and \nbreakage are depicted in figures 9 and 10 respectively. These units cannot be repaired; \nultimately they must be replaced. \n \nFigure 7 GRP media disintegration \n \n \n Figure 8 GRP media disintegration \n \n \nFigure 9 Early signs of GRP media disintegration \n Figure 10 Early signs of GRP media disintegration \n \nA design inadequacy with all GRP media panels is its inability to avoid biomass bridging. \nNo attempts to overcome this problem have been discovered by the author. Typical \nexamples of bridging for two types of GRP panels are shown in figures 11 and 12. \nBridging has the effect of reducing the effective treatment area of the RBC unit, reducing \noperational performance efficiency. \n Figure 11 (left)   Biomass bridging on \nGRP media panels \n \nFigure 12 (above) Biomass bridging \non GRP media panels \n \n2.2 Polymer media panels \n \nOne of the earliest uses of polymers as media panels was the plastic wire mesh design. It \nis interesting to note that this arrangement employed media segmentation arrangement or \npie section. This was a marked change from the use of circular media panels, as with the \nGRP configuration. To improve the available surface area various designs have been \ndeveloped. One of which is the circular coil\/wire type, see figures 13 and 14. These \npanels were cemented together at the ends of the media pack, see insert of figure 13, \nhowever the process of assembly is time consuming and expensive. The length of these \npolymer coils can be in excess of 1 meter. \n \n Figure 13 Coil and wire polymer media panel configuration \n \nFigure 14 Coil and wire polymer media panel configuration \n \nA similar arrangement of media assembly was a \u2018trapezium type\u2019 media configuration of \na polymer material (PVC). In this instance the corrugations are inclined at approximately \n10 degrees across the width of the media strip. The media strip is wound onto a the steel \nhub as \u2018pairs\u2019 of continuous strip, where the one strip has the corrugations inclined in the \none direction, whilst the second strip has the corrugations inclined in the opposite \ndirection, thereby producing a honeycomb effect. Before the media strip is wound on to \nthe hub, an adhesive is applied to the hub thereby bonding the media onto the hub. \nFurthermore the media strips are also intermittently glued to each other during winding. \nThe final construction should provide a solid media disc pack 3.6 meters diameter by 0.5 \nmeters long, see figure 15. A further advance on this type of media panel design was the \ntriangular corrugation arrangement, however, this new design required a flat polymer \nsheet to separate adjacent panels, see figure 16. \n \nFigure 15 Trapezium type media configuration \n Figure 16 Triangular polymer media panel configuration \n \nThese encouraging designs lead to further improvements in available surface area on \npolymer media corrugations. The three most popular corrugations used to date on \npolymer media panels can be seen in figures 17 to 19 and were of black high-density \npolypropylene. The distinct corrugation designs are to ensure drainage of sewage liquor, \navoiding bridging.  \n \n  \n Figure 17 Polymer media panel, type 1: Layout \n \n Figure 18 Polymer media panel, type 2: Close view of corrugation \n  Figure 19 Polymer media panel, type 3: Layout \n \nThese new designs originated in the late 1970\u2019s and were of distinct segmented \narrangement. This had the advantage of ensuring a faster and more economical \nmanufacturing process. The drawback with polymer panels in respect to GRP panels is \nthat they cannot be cemented directly onto the main shaft; consequently they require a \nsupporting structure. Separation of adjacent panels is achieved by placing adjacent \ncorrugations at 90 degrees to each other, see figure 20. Furthermore, the media panels \nwere supported by through rods that ran along the length of the pack. These were passed \nthrough circular cutout sections in the media panels and generally three to four through \nrods are used to support each segment. \n \n Figure 20 Separation of adjacent polymer media panels: type 2 panels  \n(see figure 18) separated by their corrugations. \n \n2.2.1 Mechanical deficiencies of polymer media panels \n \nAs this material type is a polymer, creep is a common mechanical deficiency that has \nbeen noted. Figure 21 shows the effect of creep on the cross-section of the polymer media \ncoil design, and can be compared with figure 13. This has the effect of reducing the \noverall diameter of the unit, see figure 22, consequently loosing effective treatment area. \nThe two packs depicted in figure 22 show the comparative effect of creep on the inlet \npack diameter. \n Figure 21 Evidence of creep in \u2018coil\u2019 type media design \n \nFigure 22 Effect of creep on the overall diameter of the media pack \n \nTearing, loss of rigidity and crumbling of high density polypropylene media panels are \nhighlighted in figures 23 to 26, and depict mechanical inadequacies in design. Tearing of \nLoss of \ndiameter \nthe media panels generally occurs in the region through which the support\/through rods \npass. \n \nFigure 23 Tearing of High density polypropylene media panels \n \nFigure 24 Tearing of High density polypropylene media panels in the vicinity of  \nthe support through rod \n Figure 25 Loss of rigidity on an end media panel \n \nFigure 26 Crumbling of High density polypropylene media panels \n \nSimilar to the GRP panels, bridging on polymer media panel is very evidently and the \nauthors are unaware of any attempts to overcome this problem in the design of RBC\u2019s, \nsee figures 27. \n \nFigure 27 Biomass bridging of High density polypropylene media panels \n \n3. DESIGN EVOLUTION OF MEDIA PANELS \n \n3.1 GRP media panels \n \nAs these panels cannot be strengthened, or replaced without physically removing the unit \nfrom its operational position, this type of media design is no longer employed in the \nUnited Kingdom. The last known manufactured RBC unit that employed GRP media \npanels was in the late 1980\u2019s. \n \n \n \n3.2 High Density polymer media panels \n \nDesigns that employed the \u2018coil type\u2019 media panels could have evolved from the net type \ndesign, as the underlying media structure is identical. They are very few RBC units \nemploying this type of media configuration and its manufacture is not employed today. \n \nThe most common media designs employ high density polypropylene materials. The \nvarious design configurations employing this material have common mechanical \ndeficiencies, particularly strength and rigidity. Tearing of panels generally occurs in the \nregion through which the support rods pass, see figure 28. The reason is attributed to \ninadequate strength of the hole\/ring circumference and poor quality finishes in \ncutting\/manufacture these holes. The jagged edges give rise to stress concentrations, \nwhich eventually lead to crack growth and tearing in this vicinity. Current designs have \nimproved the strength in this particular region and more stringent finishing requirements \nare in place, see figure 29. \n \nFigure 28 Tearing of media panel in the vicinity of the through rod \n  \nFigure 29 Improved strength of hole in media panel \n \nFollowing a mechanical design audit on RBC\u2019s [4] it was noted that the thickness of \nhigh-density polypropylene media panels employed (0.5mm) was insufficient to avoid \ntearing, improve operational life and to retain rigidity. Whilst an increased thickness is \ncurrently employed, 0.9mm, it has meant that capital costs have increased whilst whole \nlife costs have reduced. \n \nThe problem of rigidity, particularly on the end media panels was initially addressed by \ncementing the first five media panels together. Whilst this increased the rigidity, \nproblems of this nature were still observed. More recently, particularly on the larger RBC \nunits, supports have been designed to maintaining rigidity, see figure 30. Furthermore, to \novercome crumbling of the end panels, a thick polypropylene panel, in the order of 5mm, \nhas replaced the end media panel, see figure 31. In this particular instance, the design also \novercomes loss of rigidity. \n Figure 30 Design to overcome loss of rigidity \n \nFigure 31 Design to overcome loss of rigidity and crumbling \n \nIt is interesting to note that all manufacturers now employ segmented media designs. \nThere is potential to further reduce manufacturing costs, particularly in relation to the \nprocess of manufacture\/assembly of each segment, as currently, the panels are placed \nonto a jig to locate the through\/support rods. This is a very laborious execerise and a \ncostly manufacturing process; however, it is an improvement on the \u2018coil\u2019 type \nconfiguration that required circular separators to be positioned between each media panel. \nThe advantage of a segmented approach also portrays manufacturer\u2019s interest in replacing \ndamaged or fatigued polymers segments rapidly. Thus the new support structure \narrangements allow for easy removal of media segments, two design types are shown in \nfigure 32. \n \nFigure 32 Media segment design  \n \nThe newest media designs, introduced in 1995, overcomes the problem of water drainage, \nimplying less hydraulic lift and a reduction in motor unit power requirements, see figure \n33 and this is a direct cost saving.  \n Figure 33 Most recent polymer media design  \n \nFurthermore, to avoid bridging the spacing between media panels was set at 26mm. The \nspacing is achieved by placing circular rings between adjacent panels. There have been \nno reported cases of bridging to dates, 7 years into its use.  \n \n4. TYPES OF MEDIA SUPPORT STRUCTURES \n \nAs detailed in the previous sections, there are two types of media panels employed on \nRBC\u2019s; GRP and polymer types. By the nature of their design only polymer panels \nrequire a media support structure. The typical weight of a fully functional RBC unit of \n(diameter 3.0 meters) is approximately 23,000kg for a typical four pack RBC unit having \n30% immersion. Of this weight over 70% is attributed to biomass growth and entrapped \nsewage liquor. \n \nDifferent RBC support structure designs have evolved over the last 30 years with the aim \nof producing a functional system at low capital cost. The earliest known RBC unit still \noperational to date is illustrated in figure 34. The media panels on this unit were of \u2018wire \nmesh configuration\u2019 (see figure 4) and held in position by longitudinal steel through rods \nwhich run along the length of the media pack. The through rods are in turn supported by a \nframe consisting of coated steel angles and plates. The steel angle sections are joined to \nform radial arms which are in turn bolted onto a plate that is welded to the shaft, see \nbottom left of figure 35. The through rod ends are bolted onto a circumferential angle \nrim, see bottom right of figure 35. Each media pack employed three circumferential rims. \nA steel angle ran along the length of the extreme outer diameter of each media pack and \nwas held by opposite circumferential rims; this is illustrated in the top right corner of \nfigure 35. The steel angle restricts media panel movement and provides extra structural \nsupport. To date this design is still operational with no reported faults, though it must be \nstated that assembly of such a unit will be laborious and expensive due to its intricate \nconstruction. \n \n Figure 34 Design arrangement of oldest known operational unit in the UK \n \nFigure 35 Design arrangement of RBC unit showing details of the media \nsupport frame \n Another design configuration employed for supporting \u2018wire mesh type\u2019 media panels is \nshown in figure 36. The support structure consisted of segmented steel plates bents at its \nextreme periphery. Adjacent segments were bolted together. The distal ends of the media \nsupporting through rods were bolted to the steel frame. The through rods extend along the \nfull length of each media pack and provided support for the media panels. A total of five \nthrough rods are employed per segment. The cost of manufacture of this design is \nconsiderably less than that detailed earlier. These are the only two designs known to the \nauthor employed for supporting the particular media configuration. \n \nFigure 36 RBC unit with segmented steel plate support frame design \narrangement \n \nA more recent design of similar support frame arrangement is illustrated in figure 37. \nThis unit  employed circular \u2018coils\u2019 (\u220520mm) as its media extending along the length of \nthe media pack (see figure 13). The coils were held in position by outer circumferential \nstraps located at each end of the media pack, see insert in figure 37. During assembly the \ncircumferential straps are tightened to aid positioning and locating the media. A steel \nangle ran along the length of the extreme outer diameter of each media pack and was held \nby opposite radial spider arms. This particular type of design is submerged by \napproximately 60% of its total height, consequently the bearings were submerged. \nHowever by increasing the submerged area the load on the support structure is reduced. \nThe amount by which a unit can be submerged is governed by operational requirements \nof the treatment process. \n \nFigure 37 (left) \nDesign arrangements of RBC unit \nillustrating coil-type media support  \nstructure and outer circumferential  \nsupport straps \n \nA draw back with this particular design is that the circumferential straps, used to located \nthe media coils can become loose, see figure 38. With the passage of time and under \nheavy biomass growth, creep of the circular coils results in compression of the media \nsections. Consequently, the entire media section looses its rigidity and initial size, and the \ncircumferential straps become ineffective in positioning the media sections. The amount \nby which the media sections can creep is illustrated in figure 39. Furthermore, the flow of \nsewage liquor through the media sections affected by creep becomes impeded, \nconsequently, the affected media pack carries excessive liquor during its rotation. A \ndirect result of loose straps is media movement, which in turn results in additional impact \nforces on the support structure causing acceleration forces to be reacted back to the gear \ndrive unit. These reactive forces have caused the foundation bolts, securing the drive unit \nto the foundation, to work loose. Figure 40 illustrates the consequence of such a \nmechanism. \n \nFigure 38 Loose outer circumferential strap \n \n \n \n  \nFigure 39 Gap between structure and media coils caused by media creep \n \nFigure 40 Fracture of foundation bolts due to transient torque produced by \nloose media pack \n \nThe Unit illustrated in figure 41 was designed in the mid 1980\u2019s. The support structure is \nbolted to the shaft, see left picture of figure 42, and this results in increased stress \nconcentrations on the shaft. It is not surprising that this design has experienced early shaft \nfracture. At the end of the media support structure locating pins fitted into the ends of the \nthrough rods, are used to prevent axial movement, see figure 42 (right). However, \nReduction in diameter \ndue to media creep \nrotation of the through rods about it location is not restricted and results in grooves being \ncut at the ends of the through rods, finally cumulating in failure of the through rod. \n \nFigure 41 Design arrangement of RBC unit \n \nFigure 42 Design features showing method of clamping support frame to the \nmain shaft and restricting axial movement of the through rod \n The unit illustrated in figure 43 is restricted to RBC sizes with diameters of less than \n1.5meters. This design arrangement consisted of black high-density polypropylene media \npanels held in position by longitudinal through rods, which were in turn supported by a \nsteel support frame.  \n \nFigure 43 Design arrangement of RBC unit \n \nIn total, four longitudinal through rods supported each media pack. \u2018U\u2019 shaped straps \nclamped the longitudinal through rods onto a flat steel plate, which was in turn welded to \nan angle steel radial arm, see figure 44. Additional structural support was provided by a \nflat bar that was bolted to adjacent radial arms, illustrated in figures 43 and 44. \n \n \n Figure 44 \u2018U\u2019 shaped straps clamping the media support through rods to the \nsupport frame \n \nThe radial angle structure was clamped to a shaft plate. Two designs of shaft plates were \nemployed, the first was welded directly to the shaft, see figure 45, whilst the second was \na clamp mechanism that was bolted into position, see figure 46. \n \n \nFigure 45 Welded shaft plate \n \n  \nFigure 46 Bolted shaft plate \n \nMaterials used for the support structure were of mild steel while the longitudinal through \nrods and \u2018U\u2019 shaped straps were of stainless steel. It was noted that polymer sheeting was \nused to prevent direct contact between the stainless steel through rod and \u2018U shaped strap \nfrom the steel plate onto which the rod rested, see figure 47. The purpose of this sheeting \nis to eliminate galvanic corrosion. It is not clear if over the passage of time, creep of the \npolymer will result in loss of clamping efficiency of the \u2018U\u2019 strap. Furthermore, no \nattempt had been made to prevent contact between the steel supporting structure and the \nstainless steel nuts and bolts and consequently these units experience galvanic corrosion. \nThis type of RBC is only ideal for low load requirements. \n \n Figure 47 Plastic sheet to prevent contact between different materials \n \nAnother design employed for low load requirements illustrated in figure 48 and employed \nblack high-density polypropylene media panels. This unit is restricted to diameters of 1.0 \nmeters or less and its panels are held in position by longitudinal through rods, which were \nin turn supported by a steel frame.  \n \nFigure 48 RBC unit layout \n \nPolymer sheet \nSimilar to the previous design each media pack was supported by a total of four \nlongitudinal through rods. Two of the through rods were clamped onto an angle structure, \nwhich was in turned clamped to the main hollow shaft, see figure 49. The other rods were \nnot supported and simply rested on the media panels. \n \n \nFigure 49 Media pack support structure and clamping arrangement \n \n\u2018U\u2019 bolts were used to secure the steel angle to the main hollow shaft and clamp the \nthrough rods to the angle steel, see figure 49. Flat plates were used to make up \ndimensional discrepancies between the \u2018U\u2019 bolts and the longitudinal through rods, see \ninsert of figure 49. A circular plastic disc was positioned between the angle steel and the \nmedia panels and was intended to provide lateral support to the panels. Improvements of \nthe \u2018coil type\u2019 media panels have lead to the \u2018trapezium type\u2019 (PVC) media corrugations. \nThe support structure for such a configuration is illustrated in figure 50. \n \nFigure 50 Support structure design arrangement for trapezium type media \ncorrugations \n \nIn order to provide a positive drive between the media pack and shaft, twelve radial \nspider arms (six per side) are clamped to the media pack using six  through rods per pair \nof spiders, the spiders are in turn bolted to the shaft hub. Moreover, to ensure a good \ntransference of torque between the spiders and media pack, two strips of neoprene are \nsandwiched between the media pack and spider arm, see figure 51. In addition to the \nspider arms, two circumferential stainless steel banding strips are employed to offer \nfurther strength. \n \nA weakness with this design is that the action of clamping the neoprene strips between \nthe media pack and the radial spiders produces a compressive stress into the side walls of \nthe PVC media corrugations. Moreover, because both the neoprene and the PVC media \npack are viscoelastic materials, creep will most certainly occur, or even crushing, \nresulting in loss of clamping force between the media pack and spiders. The \nconsequences of loosing the clamping force between the spiders and media pack, is that \nthe weight of the media pack is transferred directly onto the shaft hub causing crushing of \nthe PVC corrugations. Figure 52 clearly illustrates the effect of crushing which has taken \nplace under one of the radial spiders.  \n \nFigure 51 Evidence of loss of clamping efficiency \nNeoprene  \nstrip \nLoss of clamping \nefficiency \n Figure 52 Evidence of crushing of media \n \nA widely employed design of RBC used for high load conditions with diameters of up to \n3 meters can be seen in figure 53 and consists of one radial spider per media segment, \nmanufactured from rolled channel or angle, and three through rods per disc segment. \nThere are 8 segments per pack with a total of 24 through rods. The spider (radial arm) is \nsecured to the shaft plate with bolts and the plate is welded to the shaft. The supporting \nstructure consisted of stainless steel angles or channels, plates, \u2018U\u2019 bolt clamps and \nthrough rods. The \u2018U\u2019 bolts were used to clamp both the inner and outer through rods \nonto the support frame, see figure 55 (left). For the older designs, illustrated in figure 20, \nthe circumferential angle frame is welded to the radial arm whilst for recent designs a \nmetal plate is used to circumferentially locate the individual segment frames, the plate \nwas bolted to the outer-rim of adjacent support frame segments, see figure 54 and 55 \n(right). Furthermore, the arrangement of the steel angle circumferential rim in figures 54 \nand 55 allowed for axial restriction and location of the through rods, not provided by \nolder designs. In more recent designs of this latter configuration (figure 21), steel plates \nhave been welded onto the end frame to improve the strength and stiffness of the media \nsupport structure, see figure 56. This development is a direct consequence of failure on \nthe support structure due to the inability to support high bending stresses. In addition, \ndiameters of RBC units employing this modification increased to 3.6 meters. It is \ninteresting to note that the method of welding the shaft plate to the shaft was not as \nillustrated in figure 46 where the weld was completely circumferential. In this instance \nthe weld was at four positions on the shaft, see figure 56. This is an attempt to reduce \nstress concentrations in the vicinity of the weld. \n \n \n \nFigure 53 RBC design arrangement employed for large units  \n Figure 54 RBC design arrangement showing double radial spider arms per \nmedia segment \n \n \nFigure 55 Methods of retaining through rods to the support structure \n Figure 56 RBC design arrangement to improve bending resistance \n \nOn these designs, clamps supporting the through rods onto the support frame have \nexperienced serious loss of clamping efficiency due to their poor design. The \u2018U\u2019 bolt or \nclamp does not have sufficient strength to adequately withstand the bending couples \nproduced by the through rod, particularly when the media segment is in the horizontal \nposition [4]. Moreover, the clamping mechanism is not sufficient to prevent localised \nfretting, which would ultimately result in loss of tightening torque of the securing nut. \nThe deeper implications of the above, is that the \u2018U\u2019 bolt would either come free, or \nexperience fatigue fracture within a few months of operation, see figure 57. The reason \nfor failure is attributed to the effect of low frequency corrosion fatigued coupled with \npossibly excessive tightening torques on the \u2018U\u2019 bolts [1]. Therefore any improved design \nmust be sufficiently robust to withstand the very large bending couples produced by the \nthrough rods, furthermore, cognisance should be given to the reaction load when the \nmedia panel is in any circumferential position as the RBC rotates. \nWelded region \non shaft plate \n Figure 57 Fractured \u2018U\u2019 bolt \n \nFurthermore, a number of these RBC designs have suffered from support frame failure. It \nis perhaps interesting to note that this design employs structural steelwork having the \nlowest cross-sectional dimensions compared with other similar size RBC examined. \nWhilst it could be argued that this design offer low capital costs they hide the high whole \nlife cost. In addition, due to the low fatigue limits of a lighter frame, fatigue fracture is \ncommon, see figures 58 and 59. \n  \n \nFigure 58 Fracture support structure; Insert shows fracture at different \nrotational position. \n \nFigure 59 Fractured support structure \n \n Another common design of RBC with a diameter ranging from 2 to 3 meters is illustrated \nin figure 60. It consists of channel radial spider arms and an angle circumferential rim. \nThe design consists of between 4 to 8 segment sections with three supporting through \nrods are employed per segment. During manufacture, the segments are lowered into the \nsupport structure frame. For this reason a section in the region where the radial spider \narm was clamped to the outer circumferential rim was cut away in the circumferential \nrim, see figure 65. Whilst the reasons for the cut away section is understood, it does pose \nthe problem of introducing localised stresses. Two of the through rods are retained by \u2018U\u2019 \nshaped straps on the outer circumferential rim, as illustrated in figure 61. The third \nthrough rod, referred to as the inner through rod is rested onto a plate within the radial \nchannel arm, see figure 62. A bolt is used to retain the inner through rod in this position, \nsee figures 60 (insert) and 62. As the inner through rod was not secured to the radial arms \nthey have been known to work loose with costly consequences, see figure 63.  \n \nFigure 60 Design arrangement illustrating channel section radial arms \n \n Figure 61 \u2018U\u2019 strap for retaining through rod to support structure \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 62 Position of inner through rod on support structure \nBolt \nChannel \nsection \nFlat plate \nLateral movement \nof through rod \n Figure 63 Loose inner through rod \n \nIn addition, due to the lack of restriction of the inner rod, media segment movement has \nbeen observed on numerous sites, see figure 64, which will result in additional impact \nforces being placed on the media support structure and can accelerate the process of \nfatigue failure and loss of bolt tightening torque. The former has been experienced on \u2018U\u2019 \nstraps, see figure 65. It is interesting to note that the fracture occurred in the region of \nmaximum stress. \n \n Figure 64 Media segment movement \n \nFigure 65 Fractured \u2018U\u2019 strap \n \nFractured \u2018U\u2019 strap \nCut away in the \ncircumferential \nLateral media movement \n Successful attempts to restrict movement of the inner through rod have been made by \npositioning a hollow circular piece over the through rod end in an attempt to restrict its \nlateral movement. Other attempts include the use of  \u2018V\u2019 shaped plates, see figure 66. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 66 \u2018V\u2019 shaped plate to restrict inner rod movement \n \nWhilst earlier designs did not restrict axial movement of the outer through rods, see \nfigure 67, this has been overcome by welding end plates onto the circumferential angle \nrim, see figure 60, 61 and 68. Figure 67 shows axial movement of an outer through rod \nand bending of the circumferential rim. The latter is a direct consequence of the large \nbending moments the structure is subject to.  \nBolt \nChannel \nsection \n\u2018V\u2019 shaped \nplate \nLateral movement \nof through rod \n Figure 67 Bend support structure \n \nIn addition due to the inadequate clamping efficiency of the \u2018U\u2019 strap the outer through \nrod has been known to rotate within its strap and cut into the support structure, see figure \n68 and 69. \n \nFigure 68 Inadequate clamping of through rods plus axial end stop \n \n Figure 69 Rotation of through rod within its clamp \n \nOf the designs already detailed it has been observed on numerous units that a mixture of \nmaterials were employed giving rise to galvanic corrosion. For instance whilst, the \nthrough rods employed were of stainless steel, the \u2018U\u2019 straps used to secure these through \nrods to the support structure were a mixture of stainless and galvanised steel. \nFurthermore, stainless steel bolts had been used to clamp components onto a steel \nstructure. It must be noted that the main hollow shaft on RBC\u2019s detailed was always of \nmild steel. To assist in separation of stainless steel bolts from the steel structure plastic \nwashers have been employed, see figure 70. Over the passage of time, these plastic \nwashers will creep with the net result of loss of bolt tightening torque, see figure 71. \nCut in end plate \ndue to rotation of \nthrough rod \n Figure 70 Plastic washer \n \nFigure 71 Loss of bolt tightening torque due to plastic washer creep \n \nThis will result in movement of components creating additional impact forces on the \nstructure. \n \nOther direct consequences of mixing materials include corrosion of the \u2018U\u2019 bolts and \u2018U\u2019 \nstraps, see figure 72. In these instances there is a direct loss of cross-sectional area of the \nbolts resulting in a reduction of load carrying capability and eventual fatigue fracture. It \nis interesting to note that on the \u2018U\u2019 bolts corrosion begins in the regions experiencing the \nhighest stresses, see insert of figure 72. This phenomenon is referred to as stress \ncorrosion fatigue. \n \nFigure 72 Stress corrosion of \u2018U\u2019 bolt \n \nAnother design configuration employed in the United Kingdom for heavy load \nrequirements is illustrated in figure 73 and consists of one radial spider per disc segment \nmanufactured from rolled channel. However, only two through rods on each segment \nwere used to support the polypropylene media panels onto the support structure. A further \ntwo through rods were used to hold the media panels in position and plastic washers were \nEvidence of stress \ncorrosion \nemployed for this purpose. This provides inadequate support of the panes and it is not \nsurprising that the media panels at the inlet end, where the biomass growth is heaviest, \nhas collapsed, see figure 74. Each media pack consisted of 12 segments. \n \n \nFigure 73 Design arrangement of RBC unit \n \nFigure 74 Inadequate support for media panels \n \nThe spider is bolted to a shaft split hub and are mechanically locked by the use of lock \nnuts, see figure 75 for a typical arrangement. The types of positive locking employed \ninclude nylon lock nuts or double lock nuts, dependent on RBC unit, the latter can be \nseen in figure 76. The drawback with nylon lock nuts exposed to sewage liquor over a \npassage of time is that they have been known to work loose. Traditionally manufacturers \nemploying double lock nuts (sometimes referred to as \u2018Jam\u2019 nuts) have placed the smaller \nnut on top of the bigger nut. Double lock nuts have the advantage of requiring minimum \nskill provided certain basic rules are applied. Historically the nuts are of different \nthickness, one standard nut and the other half the thickness of the standard nut. In \nassembly the thinner nut should be fastened first and the large nut fastened on top on the \nthinner nut [5]. \n \nFigure 75 Split hub arrangement \n Figure 76 Improper bolting of double lock nuts \n \nThe distal end of the radial spider is secured to the outer circumferential rib via a weld \ncruciform plate onto which is bolted a further rolled channel using, figure 77 illustrates \nthis technique. \n \nFigure 77 Circumferential design arrangement \n \n \nThe design arrangement illustrated in figures 78 and 79 are restricted to RBC\u2019s with a \ndiameter of 2.0m and employs four segments, each segment had a total of three through \nrods. Four radial steel channel spiders were employed which were welded at the distal \nend to steel angle sections. These were in turn bolted to steel channel sections acting as \ncircumferential rims, see figure 79 (left). The spider is secured to a shaft split hub, as \ndescriber earlier (see figure 75) bolts which are mechanically locked by the use of lock \nnuts. The through rods are secured to the media pack support frame using a single bolt, \nlocking is achieved by making use of a spring washer. \n \nFigure 78 Design arrangement of RBC \n \nFigure 79 Close view of design configuration employed in figure 78 \n One of the most common RBC designs is illustrated in figure 80 and ranges in size from \n3 to 4 meters in diameter. The support structure consists of one radial spider, \nmanufactured from rolled channel, and four through rods per disc segment.  All four \nthrough rods are secured to the support structure and a total of 12 segments were \nemployed per media pack. This is a marked improvement on the earlier design in which \nonly two through rods were attached to the support structure (figure 73). This \nimprovement offers more support for the media panels. \n \nFigure 80 Segmented design arrangement of RBC \n \nThe spider is bolted to a shaft split hub as with previous designs described earlier. Other \nfeatures of this design are identical to those reported in figures 75, 76 and 77. The \nthrough rods are secured to the media pack support frame using a single bolt and locking \nis achieved by making use of a spring washer, however, on a number of RBC's this \nthrough rod securing bolt has become loose, see figure 81. \n \nFigure 81 Loose bolt employing spring washer \n \nA concern with these designs that employ a split hub for clamping the radial spider arms \nto the shaft is that the clamps are seated on a GRP overlay and it is impossible to estimate \nhow long the GRP overlay will maintain its integral shape. Should hydrolysis of GRP \noverlay result in loss of rigidity, it is possible for the clamping plate to slide and rotate \nabout the main shaft. However, a few RBC's of this design have been in operation for \nmany years and the split shaft clamp has not shown mechanical distress. \n \n 5. EVOLUTION OF MEDIA SUPPORT STRUCTURES \n \nOver the last thirty years the evolution of mechanical design was firstly governed by \neconomies of manufacture. This is illustrated by the change from detailed intricate \ndesigns to segment less robust support structures. However, the newer designs of RBC \nunits have been plagued with mechanical deficiencies and this has governed more recent \ndesign changes. The mechanical design of an RBC is not simply selecting the best \nmaterial to perform a particular function based on stress levels, but is more concerned \nwith the corrosion and fatigue behavior of the various materials chosen at low speeds of \nloading \n \nBefore attempting to design any machine component, it is most important to understand \nthe mechanism by which the component is subject to force loading, and whether the \nloading is static or cyclic.  For example, on most medium size RBC\u2019s the media segment \nis supported by three through rods, whereby each rod is reacted back onto the media \nsupport frame and held in position by some form of end clamp.  When establishing the \nmagnitude of loading applied to each of through rods per media segment, it is a common \nmisconception to assume that each through rod supports the same load and that the \nloading is constant.  The actual load value is dependent on the type, size and orientation \nof the media corrugations; moreover, the loading is \u201cdynamic\u201d resulting from rotation. \nFor example, as the media emerges from the liquor, draining off water has to be \nconsidered in addition to the biomass loading.  Furthermore, as the media segment re-\nenters the liquor the loading has now changed both in magnitude and direction, thereby \ncausing reversed cycle loading, which is an important factor when selecting the size of \nthrough rod and rod end clamp design.  This is probably why tearing of the media in the \nvicinity of the through rod hole always occurs at the one hole before progressing onto the \nnext [4]. \n \nThree design strategies have been considered in designing the new generation of RBC \nmedia pack support structure and through rod. The first investigated the possibility of \nrigidly clamping the ends of the through rods to the support structure, this has the effect \nof lowering the bending stress in the centre of the rod, thereby allowing a small cross \nsectional dimension to be employed. Unfortunately this particular design would call for a \nmore robust support structure with associated high capital costs.  The second option was \nto consider the attachment of the through rods to the support frame as \u2018simply supported\u2019 \n(pin-jointed). However, this method would introduce larger bending stresses inn the \ncentre of the through rod and can also introduce fretting at the point of attachment to the \npin-joint resulting in premature failure.  \n \nA more palliative design solution is to allow small elastic distortions within the structure. \nEmploying this design allows the through rods to be rigidly clamped to the structure, \nhowever flexing of the support structure results in lowering the reactional bending \nstresses thereby alleviating much of the stress intensity at the point of attachment. This \nstrategy has resulted in a new method of clamping the through rods to the support \nstructure as illustrated in figure 82. \n \n Figure 82  Four-point line contact \u2018vee\u2019 block \n \nThis clamping arrangement is accomplished by bolting the top \u2018V\u2019 section onto the lower \npart. Specific tightening torques are calculated. This arrangement ensures contact \nbetween the clamp and the through rod. \n \nBest practice relating to the design of through rod end clamps is governed by the design \nof the media pack support frame, moreover, most manufacturers acknowledge the loading \npattern described above will give rise to bolt loosing. To combat loss of bolt tightening \ntorque use is made of positive locking for both nuts and bolts, see figure 83. Initial \ndifficulties of properly aligning tab washers have been over come by pre-forming the \nwasher on a jig there by ensuring the \u201cupturned\u201d section always aligns with the flat of the \nnut or bolt. The design arrangement illustrated in figures 80 and 83 offers structural \nflexibility for this rigid method of securing the through rod to the supporting structure.  \n \n Figure 83 Use of positive locking plates on nuts and bolts \n \nCurrent RBC designs have taken cognisance of axial and rotational through rod \nmovement. The method of circumferentially welding the shaft plate to the main hollow \nshaft has been improved by placing a sacrificial plate between the shaft and the shaft \nplate, see figure 84. This serves to reduce the stress concentration in the welded vicinity. \n \n Figure 84 Sacrificial plate for welding onto main hollow shaft \n \n \n6. AUXILLARY SUPPORT SYSYETMS \n6.1  Power transmission \n \nAs RBC\u2019s operate at speeds of between 0.6 to 2 revolutions per minute, most power units \nrequire some form of speed reduction system. The earliest known RBC units employed \nchain connection for transmission of power to the RBC hollow shaft. Figure 85 illustrates \nthis system on a unit of approximately 3 meters diameter, whilst figure 86 depicts the \nexact arrangement on a much smaller RBC (1.5meters diameter). \n \nSacrificial plate \n Figure 85 Chain connection between motor and main RBC shaft \n \nFigure 86 Chain connection between motor and main RBC shaft \n \nThe difficulties with this arrangement are that with the passage of time the chain will \nloose its tension and in many instances has broken. In much smaller sized RBC units \n(diameters of 1 meter or less) a belt connection is sometimes employed to drive the main \nshaft. Some RBC units employ a gear and pinion power transmission arrangement, as \nillustrated in figures 87 and 88. In this particular instance the pinion wheel consisted of 8 \nteeth driving the larger gear wheel (figure 87) consisting of 84 teeth. The larger gear \nwheel was of fabricated construction and therefore susceptible to alignment difficulties. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 87 (left) Pinion and gear \ntransmission arrangement; Larger \ngear wheel \nFigure 88 (above)  Pinion and gear \ntransmission arrangement; Pinion \n \nThis susceptibility has been very evident as severe grooving has been observed on the \nside of the segmented gear wheel plates, see figure 89. Moreover, it has been noted on a \nfew RBC units that severe wear had occurred on the contacting face of the gear tooth, \nresulting from high contact pressures and the unavoidable sliding that takes place \nbetween tooth pairs, see figure 90. \n \n Figure 89 Wear on side of gear teeth due to misalignment \n \nFigure 90 Wear on contact face of gear tooth \n \n As a direct result of the described wearing action a jerking motion of the entire RBC unit \nwas observed. This jerking action caused the rotor to be rapidly accelerated resulting in \ntransient torque forces being reacted back onto the drive unit, resulting in  foundation \nbolts retaining the power unit to fracture. This mechanism is similar to that reported \nearlier in this paper and illustrated in figure 40. \n \nOther manufacturers have opted for polyamide \u2018Tecast T\u2019 material for the pinion drive \nrollers. This implied that the rollers had been designed for a limited life. The design \nphilosophy of making the rollers as a sacrificial element could be for a number of \nreasons. The most likely rational, is that all gears experience a sliding motion and are \ntherefore susceptible to wear, and that by making the pinion drive rollers from a polymer \nwear is confined to the rollers, therefore replacement can be achieved with minimum cost \nand down time. \n \nWhilst this is a reasonable design strategy it can place an unnecessarily heavy burden on \nmaintenance personnel as there is a need for regular site visits to inspect the entire drive \nsystem, particularly as experience to date has shown the rollers to suffer accelerated \nwear. Also there have been occasions where the entire gear drive has jammed precipitated \nby worn rollers. Furthermore, severe pitting of the roller on the outer diameter has been \nobserved within only ten weeks of fitting new rollers, thereby giving rise for concern. \nMoreover, even with regular greasing, the rollers have experienced seizure caused by \nexcessive wear debris being trapped between the roller and spindle, which in turn has \npromoted wear at the outer diameter of the roller. In many cases the outer surfaces of the \nrollers have pitted, resulting in material flaking and\/or blistering, see figure 91. \n Figure 91 Material flaking on pinion roller \n \nFundamental design limitations include excessive Hertzian compression stress at the \ncontact surface between the roller and the larger gear wheel, as illustrated in figure 91. \nMoreover this particular design requires the pinion to be perfectly aligned with the larger \ngear wheel; failure to comply with this fundamental requirement would most certainly \nresult in accelerated surface flaking\/blistering of the outer diameter of the roller. Figure \n92 shows the wear to be unevenly distributed along the length of the roller, suggesting \nthat correct alignment was never achieved. \n Figure 92 Evidence of uneven wear due to misalignment \n \nThe current designs today employ a much smother power transmission systems, \neliminating the problems of loose connections and wear on pinion\/gear arrangements. \nTypical units employed today include power and speed reduction units supplied by \n\u2018David Brown\u2019, \u2018Bauer\u2019 (see figure 93) and \u2018Brevini\u2019, all of which are shaft mounted gear \ndrives and produce successful transmission requirements. \n \nFigure 93 Typical transmission unit employed on current RBC\u2019s \n It must be mentioned that though not practiced regularly, couplings connecting two shafts \nhave been employed. This arrangement is intended for use where otherwise the hollow \nshaft would be unable to support the weight of the unit. Thus, the RBC unit is essentially \nsplit into two and four bearings employed. However, to avoid the use of a second power \nunit, a coupling is employed between the shafts, see figure 94. \n \n \nFigure 94 Coupling employed to avoid the use of two power units \n \n6.2 Bearings \n \nThe bearings employed on RBC units are typically roller element bearings as this has the \nadvantage of accommodating misalignment. In smaller sized units dry rubbing type \nbearings have been employed, see figure 95. The material used in figure 95 was an \nunfilled \u2018polyamide\u2019 (nylon) which has good resistance to abrasion and works well at low \nrubbing speeds. On very few occasions submerged bearings are employed. In this \ninstance the entire unit is submerged by approximately 60% of its diameter. \n \nFigure 95 Dry rubbing bearings \n \nAlmost all RBC bearings employed rubber seals to retain the bearing lubricant (grease) \nwithin the housing. Furthermore, it has been observed that none of the bearings used on \nRBC's have grease escape or discharge values. Ideally a discharge (escape) valve should \nbe fitted to the underside of the housing, opposite to the lubrication entry point. This has \nthe advantage of ensuring the passage of fresh grease across the bearing and will prevent \ngrease build up within the housing. A build up of grease will force out the bearing seals \nfrom their intended position, resulting in contamination of the lubricant and accelerating \nbearing failure, see figure 96. Following a recent investigation on the effectiveness of \nvarious seal types to reduce the ingress of sewage liquor and retain grease within the \nhousing [6], Aluminium triple labyrinth (ATL) was recommended. Furthermore, care \nmust be taken to ensure that the discharged grease does not fall into the sewage liquor. \n \n Figure 96 Loss of sealing efficiency of the bearing \n \nIn addition, analysis of failed bearings has shown them to have adequate load carrying \ncapabilities, but poor elastohyrodynamic film thickness. An adequate \nelastohydrodynamic film thickness is essential in maintaining an oil film between the \ncomponents in the bearing. Furthermore, because of the slow rotational speed the \ncentrifugal force generated within the bearing, to ensure circulation of the grease is \ngreatly reduced in comparison to medium\/high speed bearings. Therefore, even if grease \nwas continually pumped into the bearing housing, there is no guarantee that the grease \nwould reach the critical components, i.e., the raceway and rollers. This will inevitably \nlead to grease starvation of the most critical bearing components. The cause of premature \nbearing failure on the several RBC\u2019s is attributed to lack of lubrication, either as a result \nof an inadequate grade of grease, grease starvation or in some instances grease \ncontamination. The latter has been observed on numerous RBC units, see figure 97. \n \n Figure 97 Evidence of rust in a bearing housing \n \nAll current RBC bearings employ discharge valves to ensure fresh grease reaches critical \nparts in the bearing. In addition, due to the low rotational speeds combined with heavy \nreactional loads on RBC\u2019s, all current designs now employ grease with a minimum base \noil viscosity of 1200 centistokes (cSt). Other typical bearing defects observed are \nillustrated in figures 98 and 99. \n \nFigure 98 Scored stub shaft due to worn rolling element of bearing (see insert) \n Figure 99 Fractured outer race \n \n6.3 Stub shaft and shaft \n \nAll RBC designs employ a stub shaft for locating the entire unit onto its bearings. In \nsome design configurations, the stub shaft is bolted onto a plate which in turn is welded \nto the ends of the main hollow shaft, see figure 100. Without a thorough understanding of \ncorrosion fatigue at low rotational speeds [4] these bolts have been known to fracture \nwith devasting consequences, see figures 101 and 102. In some instances, apart from the \ncomplete loss of operation of the RBC unit, the GRP basin tank which contains the \nsewage liquor has been known to get damaged. Cognizance of the lowering effects on \nfatigue limits due to the combined effect of corrosion and low rotational speeds can \novercome this mechanical deficiency. \n \n Figure 100 Coupling bolts used to clamp stub shaft to the main hollow shaft  \n \nFigure 101 Fracture of coupling bolts \nFractured \ncoupling bolt \nhead\n Figure 102 Complete collapse of RBC unit due to fracture of stub shaft coupling \nbolts \n \nAnother design employed for attachment of the stub shaft to the main shaft involves \ncircumferentially welding the stub shaft directly onto the main shaft. This has the \ndisadvantage of creating stress raises on the main hollow shaft. \n \nWhilst the consequences of fractured coupling bolts have been detailed, it has also been \nobserved that poor quality of manufacture and assembly of the stub shaft onto the main \nshaft has resulted in early fracture of the coupling bolts. In this instance, the tapped recess \nfor the coupling bolts on the plate to be welded onto main hollow shaft were shorter that \nspecified. As a direct consequence, the specified clamping torques could not be achieved \nand the rotor collapsed after less than 2 months of operation. \n \nThe effect of fractured coupling stub shaft bolts on other auxiliary systems, such as the \ngearbox and bearings is devasting. Even more damaging to the auxiliary systems, \nincluding the stub shaft, is complete fracture of the main hollow shaft, see figure 103. \nHowever, with a better understanding of the effects of corrosion fatigue at low rotational \nspeeds, maximum stress levels for design of the main components of the RBC have been \ndetailed [4]. \n \nFigure 103 Shaft fracture \n \n7. CONCLUSIONS \n \nThe mechanical evolution of the RBC over the last thirty years has been detailed. As a \nconsequence of developments in media design glass reinforced polymer media panels are \nno longer manufactured due to associated high costs. The most commonly used media \npanels today are high-density polypropylene of which many designs have emerged. To \nretain operational requirements an increase in panel thickness and strength of the holes \nwhere the through rods pass is suggested. Reducing the effects of drag and hydraulic lift \ntime serves to reduce power requirements.  \n \nThe majority of mechanical deficiencies on the support structure are attributed the effect \nof low frequency corrosion fatigued coupled with mixture of materials, inadequate \nclamping arrangement of all through-rods and the use of a polymer sheeting and washers \nto avoid direct contact of differing materials. The economic argument in relation to the \ncurrent designs is really concerned with the conflict between balancing the initial capital \ncost of the equipment, with the cost of maintenance over the life of the RBC. However, \ngood design should be focused on providing equipment requiring little maintenance, at a \ncompetitive cost, whilst maintaining stringent manufacturing standards. \n \nA recently designed unit (1996) that takes cognisance of the difficulties with media and \nmechanical designs is illustrated in figures 33 and 104. The unit illustrated in figure 33 \nemployed steel \u2018T\u2019 sections for the support structure and the through rods were secured to \nthe structure with \u2018V\u2019 shaped clamps, similar to that illustrated in figure 82. The unit \nillustrated in figure 104 employed steel hollow box sections for the support structure and \nemployed \u2018V\u2019 shaped clamps. It is interesting to note that the oldest designs of RBC, \nillustrated in figures 34 and 36 are still operational today with no reported faults \n \n Figure 104 New generation RBC  \n \nIn relation to the RBC auxiliary systems, power and speed reduction units have evolved \nto produce much smoother transmission. Bearings currently employed have discharge \nvalves to aid the movement of grease within the bearing. It would be of great benefit to \nuse dry rubbing bearings on larger RBC units and completely eliminate the need for \nlubrication. This would also save on operational costs associated with maintenance \nteams. With a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of mechanical failure, a new \napproach to RBC design has resulted in more robust RBC units. \n \n8.
