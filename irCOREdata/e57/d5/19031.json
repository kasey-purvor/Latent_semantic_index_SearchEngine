It has also been shown that uni-\nmanual adaptation to opposing novel environments is\npossible if they are associated with different workspaces.\nThe main aim of this study was to test if adaptation to\nopposing velocity dependent viscous forces with one arm\ncould improve the initial performance of the other arm.

Subjects\ninitially adapted to opposing viscous forces separated by\ntarget location. Our measure of performance was the cor-\nrelation between the speed profiles of each movement\nwithin a force condition and an \u2018average\u2019 trajectory within\nnull force conditions. Adaptation to the opposing forces\nwas seen during initial acquisition with a significantly\nimproved coefficient in epoch eight compared to epoch\none. We then tested interlimb transfer from the dominant to\nnon-dominant arm (D ? ND) and vice-versa (ND ? D)\nacross either an extrinsic or intrinsic coordinative system.\nInterlimb transfer was only seen from the dominant to the\nnon-dominant limb across an intrinsic coordinative system.\nThese results support previous studies involving adaptation\nto a single dynamic force but also indicate that interlimb\ntransfer of multiple opposing states is possible. This sug-\ngests that the information available at the level of\nrepresentation allowing interlimb transfer can be more\nintricate than a general movement goal or a single per-\nceived directional error.\nIntroduction\nIt has recently been shown that if a subject learns to adapt\nto a novel environment with one arm it improves the\nsubsequent performance of the other (Criscimagna-\nHemminger et al. 2003; Dizio and Lackner, 1995; Malfait\nand Ostry 2004; Sainburg and Wang 2002; Wang and\nSainburg 2003, 2004a, b) The observed interlimb transfer is\nnot symmetrical, with the direction of transfer dependent\non the type of novel environment and on the movement\nparameter being measured.\nHwang et al. (2006) have recently proposed that two\ninternal models are formed during adaptation to novel\ndynamics; one mainly based on proprioception and the\nother on vision. During dynamic adaptation the proprio-\nceptive model strongly influences reaching performance\nbut does not affect awareness of the adaptive state. The\nvisual model strongly influences awareness but has a much\nsmaller effect on reaching performance. The authors\nbelieve that performance is the sum of a strong implicit\nmodel that is based on proprioception and is effector\ndependent and a weak explicit model that depends on\nvision and is effector independent. Specifically they predict\nthat interlimb transfer is a consequence of the subject\nbecoming explicitly aware of the novel environment.\nThe situations in which interlimb transfer has been\nreported have largely been restricted to adaptation to a\nsingle kinematic or dynamic novel environment. It is\nunclear whether transfer would persist when encountering a\nJ. M. Galea (&) \u0001 R. C.

Wang and Sainburg (2004b) have\nshown that, unlike intralimb adaptation, movements to\nmultiple target directions does not improve generalisation\nacross limbs. They believe that interlimb transfer occurs\nupstream from the effector-specific generalisation seen in\nmultiple direction adaptation. This suggests that interlimb\ntransfer may be occurring at a level where only very gen-\neral information is transferable\u2014for example the perceived\ndirection of a visual-motor displacement (Malfait and\nOstry 2004).\nUnimanual dual adaptation to opposing novel environ-\nments has been shown to be either very slow (Osu et al.\n2004; Wada et al. 2003) or even impossible (Krakauer et al.\n1999; Karniel and Mussa-Ivaldi 2002). In contrast Wada\net al. (2003) have shown that when the opposing environ-\nments can be easily discriminated and the contextual\ninformation is clear and distinct, dual adaptation is possi-\nble. Hwang et al. (2006) showed that optimal performance\nwithin a dual adaptation task occurs when the subject has\nvisual and proprioceptive cues. They also found that pro-\nprioceptive cues have a significantly larger influence on\nperformance than visual cues, although dual adaptation was\nseen within both situations.\nAs interlimb transfer may be occurring at a very abstract\nlevel of movement representation (Malfait and Ostry 2004)\nit is unknown whether the more complex representation\ninvolved within dual adaptation would transfer across\nlimbs. However the development of an effector indepen-\ndent visual model does seem to take place during dual\nadaptation to opposing dynamic forces, and is proposed to\nbe a prerequisite for interlimb transfer (Hwang et al. 2006).\nThis study tested whether adaptation to opposing\ndynamic viscous forces with one limb would improve the\ninitial performance of the other limb. Our aim was to ini-\ntially extend the findings of previous interlimb transfer\nstudies by indicating whether a more complex task\ninvolving dual adaptation to opposing states could be\ntransferred.\nThe results will also indicate whether transfer occurs\nacross an extrinsic spatial or intrinsic joint based coordi-\nnate system. On the basis of Hwang et al.\u2019s (2006)\npredictions, transfer should always be observed across an\nextrinsic coordinate system as it is based on the explicit\nvisual model. However Wang and Sainburg (2004a) found\ntransfer across an intrinsic coordinate system suggesting\nthat the coordinate system used to represent movement\nwithin the explicit visual model may not be consistent.\nTo test these ideas subjects made movements to targets\nwith either the left or right limb, with the type of viscous\nforce (either assistive or resistive) experienced on a spe-\ncific trial dependent on the location of the target. Then the\nother limb was exposed to the two forces, with each force\nassociated with targets in either similar spatial locations,\nwhich can be described as an extrinsic coordinative sys-\ntem, or mirror symmetrically similar locations, which can\nbe described as an intrinsic, joint based, coordinative\nsystem (Wang and Sainburg 2004a).\nMethod\nSubjects\nTwenty-five healthy subjects (13 male and 12 female) with\na mean age of 25 (\u00b14) took part. They were all right handed\nand had normal or corrected to normal vision. Right-\nhandedness was assessed using the ten-item version of the\nEdinburgh inventory (Oldfield 1971) (mean = 68, decile\nR.3). All subjects were recruited from the university\ncommunity and were paid to participate whilst providing\ninformed consent. This study was approved by the school\nethics committee and therefore was performed in accor-\ndance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964\nDeclaration of Helsinki.\nMaterials and procedure\nSubjects sat facing two-mirror symmetric vBOT motor dri-\nven manipulanda (Bays and Wolpert 2006) with a computer\nscreen approximately a metre in front of them at eye level.\nThe subjects grasped the handle of the vBOT directly in front\nof the arm in use; handle position was displayed as a marker\non the screen. Each arm was supported at the elbow with a\nsling and the subjects wore goggles with a horizontal blinker\nensuring their arms were not visible. In order to maintain\nboth extrinsic and intrinsic dissociation of targets, opposing\nviscous forces were used as they would not distort the\nmovement direction but would still influence hand trajectory\n(Wada et al. 2003). The manipulanda generated the viscous\nforce as shown in Eq. (1).\ns \u00bc c \u0002 m \u00f01\u00de\nwhere s is product of the manipulandum velocity (v) and\na viscous constant (c), specified in N\/(cm\/s). The viscous\nconstants used were \u00030.4 for a resistive force-field and\n0.12 for an assistive force-field. Our aim was to primarily\ndissociate the movement towards each target through\ndifferent extrinsic workspace locations. However, the\ntarget locations were also based on the preferred angular\ndirection of a specific muscle (Thoroughman and Shad-\nmehr 1999). Computer generated visual targets appeared\non the screen randomly in one of four positions (Fig. 1).\nThese positions were based on Thoroughman and Shad-\nmehr\u2019s (1999) estimations of the directional bias for the\n268 Exp Brain Res (2007) 182:267\u2013273\n123\nbiceps, triceps, anterior deltoid and posterior deltoid. Each\ntarget represented the direction in which maximal acti-\nvation occurred for one of these particular muscles. Hence\nthe targets were proposed to be separated by both visual\nlocation (extrinsic) and by the activation of a primary\nmuscle (intrinsic). The subjects were required to move\nfrom the starting position towards the visible target with a\nsmooth, straight trajectory and a clear end-point. Once\nthey had began to move, the marker indicating their hand\nposition disappeared, providing no online visual feedback.\nOnce the movement fell below a velocity threshold an\nend error marker appeared; this was red, green or yellow.\nRed indicated that their movement was too slow; green\ntoo fast and yellow was within the required time range of\n500\u2013600 ms. The marker then reappeared allowing the\nsubject to move back to the starting position in the centre\nof the screen with online feedback, but with no forces\napplied to the manipulanda.\nExperimental protocol\nThere were five groups (Fig. 1). All conditions involved a\nbaseline phase where each arm moved to each 4 targets 32\ntimes (128) while experiencing a null force. The training\nphase involved moving to each target 48 times (192) and\nthe test phase involved moving to each target 26 times\n(104).\nFor group RL_ext and LR_ext, during the training and\ntest phases the forces occurred in similar spatial locations\n(extrinsic coordinate system) (Fig. 1). Group RL_ext tested\ndominant ? non-dominant arm transfer, while group\nLR_ext tested non-dominant ? dominant arm transfer.\nFor group RL_int and LR_int the training and test phases\ninvolved forces occurring in opposing spatial locations but\nin similar joint directions (intrinsic coordinate system)\n(Fig. 1). Group RL_int tested for dominant ? non-domi-\nnant arm transfer and group LR_int tested non-dominant\n? dominant arm transfer.\nFor groups with forces in similar extrinsic coordinates\nthe target positions remained the same across the training\nand test phases. Based on Thoroughman and Shadmehr\u2019s\n(1999) estimations group RL_ext had target positions of\n40\u0002, 130\u0002, 220\u0002 and 310\u0002 from the positive x-axis and\ngroup LR_ext had positions of 50\u0002, 140\u0002, 230\u0002 and 320\u0002.\nFor groups with forces in similar intrinsic coordinates the\ntarget positions were adjusted across the training and test\nphase. Group RL_int began with positions of 40\u0002, 130\u0002,\n220\u0002 and 310\u0002. The targets would then move 10\u0002 in a\ncounter-clockwise direction to 50\u0002, 140\u0002, 230\u0002 and 320\u0002 in\nthe test phase. The opposite occurred for the LR_int group\n(Fig. 1).\nAs the training phase in group LR_ext and test phase in\ngroup RL_int involved slightly different target locations\nfor left hand movements, a final group L_control was\nrequired as a na\u0131\u00a8ve performance comparison for group\nRL_int. L_control only involved a baseline and training\nphase and the training phase had similar target locations to\nthe left hand within RL_int.\nAnalysis\nHand positions and speeds were sampled at 60 Hz with\nmovements exceeding 2 s being discarded (<1%). Speeds\nwere then resampled to a uniform 200 samples for each\nmovement. In order to compare hand trajectories a tech-\nnique developed by Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi (1994)\nwas used which quantified a measure of correlation\nbetween two sampled vector fields. In order to calculate a\n\u2018typical\u2019 hand trajectory the resampled speed profiles of the\nlast ten movements towards each target within the baseline\nFig. 1 The four main experimental groups. The numbers in brackets\nindicate the amount of movements to each target. The baseline\ninvolved a set with the left and right arms experiencing the task within\na null environment. The figure indicates exact target locations. For the\nextrinsic groups the targets have similar spatial locations for the train\nand test phases (e.g., top row). For the intrinsic groups the targets\nhave similar joint angle positions for the train and test phases (e.g.,\nbottom row). For each target: \u0003 resistive force, + assistive force.\nThese indicate the force applied to the target within that quadrant\nExp Brain Res (2007) 182:267\u2013273 269\n123\nperiod were averaged for each subject. These movements\nwere required to have durations between 450 and 650 ms.\nIndividual resampled movements during the train and test\nphases were then correlated with the \u2018typical\u2019 speed profile\ncalculated for the relevant target. This produced a corre-\nlation coefficient (r) indicating the amount of similarity\nbetween the speed profiles. The coefficient (r) values were\nthen converted into z-scores using Fisher\u2019s transformation\n(Eq. 2) (Fisher 1915, 1921). By using this transformation r\nis converted into a z value, which is normally distributed,\nand so can be used in parametric tests\nz\u00f0n\u00de \u00bc 1=2 log 1 \u00fe r\u00f0n\u00de=1 \u0003 r\u00f0n\u00de\n\u0001 \u0002\n: \u00f02\u00de\nEpochs were created by averaging z across three trials; for\neach target location there were 16 epochs for the training\nphase and 8 epochs for the test phase. As a result only the\ninitial eight epochs within the training phase was used for\ncomparison. As no significant differences were found\nbetween movements towards the two assistive and, sepa-\nrately, the two resistive targets these pairs were combined\nfor all analysis.\nSeparate repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted\non the non-dominant ? dominant (train. RL_ext, test.\nLR_ext and test. LR_int) and dominant ? non-dominant\n(train. LR_ext, test. RL_ext and test. RL_int) comparisons\nwith group (3) as a between-group factor and force\n(resistive, assistive) and epoch (8) as within-group factors.\nBonferroni post-hoc tests were performed on all significant\nbetween-group comparisons.\nResults\nSummary\nDuring the baseline phase normal bell-shaped speed pro-\nfiles were produced. When initially exposed to the velocity\ndependent viscous forces the hand trajectories were dis-\ntorted. The assistive force caused maximal speed to both\nincrease and take place earlier in the movement. A second\ncorrective peak also appeared. The resistive force caused a\ndecrease in maximal speed and a slower deceleration\nphase. The shape and size of the speed profile was affected\nmore by the assistive than resistive force. However, by the\nend of the training phase the subject\u2019s profiles move\ntowards \u2018typical\u2019 baseline performance.\nFigure 2 shows the transformed correlation coefficient\nvalues (z) averaged across groups. A high z value corre-\nsponded to a strong correlation between the speed profiles\nof a movement within a force and a \u2018typical\u2019 movement\nwithin baseline. Using repeated measures ANOVAs\n(3 groups \u00b7 2 forces \u00b7 8 epochs) two sets of comparisons\nwere made: non-dominant ? dominant (ND\u2013D) (train.\nRL_ext, test. LR_ext and test. LR_int) and domi-\nnant ? non-dominant (D\u2013ND) (train. LR_ext, test. RL_ext\nand test. RL_int). For both comparisons there was a main\neffect for epoch [F(7,189) \u0004 5.296, P \u0005 0.0005] and force\n[F(1,27) \u0004 112.978, P \u0005 0.0005]. However there was only\na main effect of condition for the (D\u2013ND) comparison\n[F(1,27) = 18.502, P = 0.0005].\nTraining\nFigure 2a, b shows the training phase for the four experi-\nmental groups. In order to assess the level of final\nadaptation, a comparison was made across groups using the\nfinal three epochs (14\u201316). For the resistive force the main\neffect of epoch and group on final adaptation level were not\nsignificant. For the assistive force the main effect of epoch\nwas not significant, however, there was a main effect for\ngroup [F(3,36) = 2.924, P < 0.047]. A bonferroni post-hoc\ntest failed to find any significant differences between the\ngroups (P \u0004 0.202). The non-significant effect for epoch\nindicates that for both assistive and resistive forces a pla-\nteau of performance had been reached before the last three\nepochs of the training phases. For the resistive force a\nsimilar level of performance was observed across groups,\nhowever, for the assistive force there was an observable\ndifference between hands. Figure 2b clearly shows the\nright hand groups (RL_int and RL_ext) produced higher z\nscores in comparison to the left hand groups (LR_int and\nLR_ext). However, when assessing interlimb transfer only\ndata from the left or right hand were compared. This means\nthat for all comparisons an equivalent level of performance\nhad been reached in the relevant, compared, groups.\nThe two main groups for assessing naive performance\nwithout opposite limb training were RL_ext train and\nLR_ext train. Figure 2c\u2013f shows that for both there is an\nincrease in the z score from epoch one to eight with the\nmain effect of epoch confirming this (P \u0005 0.0005). The\nimprovement ranged from 14 to 24% for the resistive force,\nand 37\u201341% for the assistive force. This indicates that\nadaptation to the opposing dynamic forces took place for\nthe right (RL_ext train) and left (LR_ext train) arms during\nna\u0131\u00a8ve performance.\nIt is also clear that the assistive force caused a larger\ndecrement in performance in comparison to the resistive\nforce with the main effect of force (P \u0005 0.0005) confirm-\ning this (Fig. 2 note the difference in vertical scale for the\nupper and lower graphs). Within epoch one the initial z\nscores were 0.46\u20130.50 for the assistive force and 1.04\u20131.18\nfor the resistive force. The lower z scores within an assis-\ntive force indicate that there was a larger deviation from a\n\u2018typical\u2019 baseline velocity profile.\n270 Exp Brain Res (2007) 182:267\u2013273\n123\nInterlimb transfer\nIn order to test for interlimb transfer the na\u0131\u00a8ve performance\nin the training phase was compared with the performance,\nafter opposite limb training, in the test phase.

This indicates\nthat prior training with the non-dominant left arm did not\nimprove the subsequent performance of the dominant right\narm.\nFor the (D\u2013ND) comparison, Fig. 2e, f shows that there\nis a noticeable difference between RL_int test and the other\ntwo groups (LR_ext train and RL_ext test). This is con-\nfirmed by the significant main effect of group\n(P = 0.0005). Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons showed a\nsignificant difference between RL_int test and the other\ntwo groups LR_ext train (P = 0.0005) and RL_ext test\n(P = 0.0005). This suggests that for both forces prior\ntraining with the dominant right arm improved the per-\nformance of the non-dominant left arm. This interlimb\ntransfer only occurred when the forces were similar across\nan intrinsic coordinate system as RL_ext test was no dif-\nferent from LR_ext train (P = 1).\nDiscussion\nSummary\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate whether concurrent\nadaptation to opposing viscous forces with one limb would\nimprove the initial performance of the other. The results\nindicate that interlimb transfer occurred from the dominant\nto the non-dominant limb across an intrinsic coordinative\nsystem.\nTraining\nIt has been proposed that adaptation to opposing forces can\nbe measured as an increased correlation coefficient\nbetween the speed profiles of individual movements made\nwithin, a force, and a \u2018typical velocity profile\u2019 within a null\nfield (Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi 1994; Wada et al. 2003).\nWithin all training groups this value increases from epoch\none to eight. Importantly, for all the training groups there\nwas a significant improvement suggesting dual adaptation\nto the opposing forces had occurred.\nThere is a noticeable difference between the correlation\ncoefficients seen in movements within an assistive and\nresistive force. The movements within the resistive force\nhad transformed coefficients of 1\u20131.7 whilst movements\nwithin the assistive force had lower values between 0.3 and\n1. This suggests that the movement trajectory was distorted\nmore by the assistive than the resistive force. Since the\nforces were velocity dependent, this difference can be\nexplained by positive-feedback. The assistive force caused\nan increase in the velocity of the movement, which in turn\nresulted in the force becoming even stronger. The opposite\neffect is seen with the resistive force where an increase in\nforce causes the movement speed to slow, (i.e.,) a negative\nfeedback loop. Hence the small improvements in adapta-\ntion seen within the resistive force may be attributable to\nthe negative feedback effect, such that the initial deviations\nin movement trajectory were small.\nWithin the training phase there were differences\nbetween the final adaptation levels, specifically in the as-\nsistive force condition where there was a clear difference\nbetween the groups which trained with either the left or\nright arm. Importantly however, when a comparison was\nmade between groups their final adaptation values were\nalways similar for the training phase. Moreover, as no\nsignificant differences were found between the last three\nepochs of the training phase it suggests all groups had\nreached a plateau in performance.\nInterlimb transfer\nThe interlimb transfer we observed from the dominant to\nthe non-dominant limb is in agreement with previous work\nwith adaptation to a single dynamic force (Criscimagna-\nHemminger et al. 2003; Dizio and Lackner 1995; Malfait\nand Ostry 2004; Wang and Sainburg 2004a). Interlimb\ntransfer supports the idea that motor adaptation is not\ncompletely effector specific; however asymmetric transfer\nsuggests effector dependent components (Vangheluwe\net al. 2005; Wang and Sainburg 2004b).\nPrevious studies have reported transfer across different\ncoordinate systems. Criscimagna-Hemminger et al. (2003)\nand Malfait and Ostry (2004) used a velocity dependent\nforce and found transfer across an extrinsic coordinate\nsystem. In contrast Wang and Sainburg (2004a) used a\nconstant inertial force and found transfer across an intrinsic\ncoordinative system. As we used velocity dependent vis-\ncous forces it might be expected that our results would be\nsimilar to those of Criscimagna-Hemminger et al. (2003)\nand Malfait and Ostry (2004); instead we found transfer\nacross an intrinsic coordinate system.\nThe relationship between different types of forces,\nsensory information and the resulting pattern of interlimb\ngeneralization remains unclear (Wang and Sainburg\n2004a). However Hwang et al. (2006) recently proposed\nthat interlimb transfer is a consequence of an effector\nindependent internal model which is predominately based\nvision. They believe that transfer should only occur in\nextrinsic coordinates and is highly dependent on the subject\nbecoming explicitly aware of the novel environment.\nWe provide evidence that interlimb transfer can occur\nacross intrinsic coordinates supporting previous work by\nWang and Sainburg (2004a). They conclude that the\n272 Exp Brain Res (2007) 182:267\u2013273\n123\npattern of interlimb transfer may not have followed an\nextrinsic coordinate system due to their force perturbation\nbeing inertial and so changing the type of proprioceptive\ninformation the subjects received. However according to\nHwang et al. (2006) the type of proprioceptive information\nshould not influence interlimb transfer, as it has little\ncontribution to the explicit visual model. The present study\nshows that transfer across intrinsic coordinates can occur\nwith viscous velocity dependent forces. This suggests that a\nfactor other than the type of dynamic force is determining\nthe pattern of interlimb transfer.\nWithin our experimental set-up subjects received only\nterminal vision and the forces they experienced resulted in\nminimal observable error in the end position of their\nmovement. This would suggest that they lacked visual cues\nregarding the forces they were experiencing. However, it is\nvery likely that the subjects were still aware of these per-\nturbations, as they were clearly detectable. We propose that\nexplicit awareness of the perturbation facilitates interlimb\ntransfer and awareness is four times more dependent\non visual information than proprioceptive information\n(Malfait and Ostry 2004; Hwang et al. 2006). However, as\nthe visual errors are both small and do not directly identify\nthe two force conditions, while the forces are clearly pro-\nprioceptively detectable, interlimb transfer occurs in\nintrinsic coordinates. Further investigation is required to\nunderstand how such intrinsic interlimb transfer could be\naccounted for by the model proposed by Hwang et al.\n(2006).\nIt has also been suggested that the general movement\ngoal (Vangheluwe et al. 2005) or perceived direction of a\nvisual\u2013motor displacement (Malfait and Ostry 2004) con-\nstitutes the higher level of movement representation, which\nallows interlimb transfer. The present results suggest that at\nthis level opposing motor states can be concurrently rep-\nresented and transferred in an effector specific manner.\nThis implies that the information available at this level can\nbe more intricate than a general movement goal or a single\nperceived directional error.\nIn summary, these results suggest that two opposing\nmotor states can be concurrently transferred across limbs.\nThe results are specific to one direction (dominant ? non-\ndominant) and one coordinate system (intrinsic). We pro-\npose that this interlimb transfer is a consequence of a higher\nlevel of movement representation, which is effector inde-\npendent. Interestingly, negative interference was not seen\nwhen the targets were opposed across an extrinsic coordinate\nsystem, supporting previous studies which suggest that if the\ninformation to be transferred is not useful then the link\nbetween the limbs is not made (Wang and Sainburg 2004b).\nReferences\nBays PM, Wolpert DM (2006) Actions and consequences in bimanual\ninteraction are represented in different coordinate systems.\nJ Neurosci 26(26):7121-7126\nCriscimagna-Hemminger SE, Donchin O, Gazzaniga MS, Shadmehr\nR (2003) Learned dynamics of reaching movements generalize\nfrom dominant to nondominant arm.
