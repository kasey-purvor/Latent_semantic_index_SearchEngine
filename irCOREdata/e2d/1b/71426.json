On the Sensitivity of the Transmit MIMO Wiener Filter With Respect to Channel and Noise Second-Order Statistics Uncertainties Despoina Tsipouridou and Athanasios P. Liavas, Member, IEEE Abstract\u2014We consider the sensitivity of the transmit multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Wiener \ufb01lter with respect to channel and noise second-order statistics (SOS) uncertainties. Using results from matrix perturbation theory, we derive second-order approximations to the excess mean-square error (EMSE) induced by using the channel or noise SOS estimates as if they were the true quantities. Assuming optimal training and suf\ufb01ciently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we develop simple and informative approximations to the EMSE, which indicate that the channel estimation errors are much more signi\ufb01cant than the noise SOS estimation errors. Uncertainties due to channel time variations induce EMSE that increases with increasing SNR and asymptotically tends to a constant value. Index Terms\u2014Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, pre-equalization, Wiener \ufb01ltering. I. INTRODUCTION Joint optimization of transmit and receive \ufb01lters for combatting frequency selectivity and\/or interstream interference in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) or multiuser systems has been extensively studied (see, for example, [1] and the references therein). In order to keep the mobile units as simple as possible, we may consider separate transmit or receive processing. The transmit matched \ufb01lter (TxMF), the transmit zero-forcing \ufb01lter (TxZF) and the transmit Wiener \ufb01lter (TxWF) are three linear pre-equalization (or precoding) structures that combat frequency selectivity and\/or interstream interference and keep the receivers simple, because the only processing required at the receiver is a scalar scaling [1], [2]. The TxWF, which outperforms the two other structures in terms of mean-square error (MSE) and bit-error rate (BER) [1], can be computed if the channel and the input and noise second-order statistics (SOS) are perfectly known at the transmitter.

CONCLUSION\nThe problem of estimating the parameters in continuous-time sto-\nchastic signals, represented by CARMA processes, from discrete-time\ndata has been studied. The suggested solution is to fit the covariance\nfunction, parameterized by the process parameters, to sample covari-\nances. It has been shown that the estimation method gives consistent\nestimates, and an approximate covariance matrix for the estimated pa-\nrameters has been derived. The validity of the derived expression was\ninvestigated in a numerical study, where it was seen that the variances\nare very close to the CRB for certain choices of the sampling interval\nand the number of covariance elements used in the criterion function.\nOne important use of the derived covariance matrix is for choosing the\nuser parameters of the method; by comparing the variances with the\nCRB for different choices of the user parameters, a suitable choice can\nbe made.\nREFERENCES\n[1] E.

INTRODUCTION\nMost of the target tracking algorithms consider a single moving ex-\ntended object as a point and estimate its center of mass based on the\nincoming sensor data, such as range and bearing. However, recent high-\nresolution sensor systems are able to resolve individual features or mea-\nsurement sources on the extended object. Such an object can be mod-\nelled as a rigid or semi-rigid set of point sources, each of which may\nbe the origin of a sensor measurement [2]. The possibility to addition-\nally make use of the high-resolution measurements is referred to as\nextended object tracking. Knowledge of the object shape parameters is\nespecially important for the object type classification.\nThe considered problem consists of both state and size parameters\nestimation of an extended target when tracking it. Estimation of static\nparameters in general nonlinear non-Gaussian state-space models is a\nlong-standing problem [3]\u2013[5]. Although in the literature there are re-\nsults with Monte Carlo (particle filtering) methods, a well-known draw-\nback of particle filtering for static parameters estimation is the degen-\neracy, the case when only one particle has a significant weight. Other\nsolutions based on the expectation-maximization (EM) approach are\nalso proposed. Some of the problems with the EM-type algorithm are\ndue to the fact that it is of gradient type, and it can be trapped by local\nextremums.\nThe object extent parameters can be modeled in many different ways\n[2], [6]\u2013[8]. The ellipsoidal object model proposed in [7] and [9] is\nadopted in our work. We are concerned with objects moving in a plane.\nManuscript received July 27, 2006; revised June 21, 2007.

Shape\nparameters are included in [7] in the state vector together with kine-\nmatic parameters and are estimated by extended, unscented Kalman\nfilters (EKFs, UKFs) and particle filtering. However, as pointed out\nin [7] and [9], the EKF is prone to divergence due to the presence of\nhigh nonlinearities, and the Monte Carlo (MC) approach can avoid this\nproblem [10]. This motivates us to choose the MC framework and de-\nvelop strategies that can cope with these problems.\nThe challenge of the problem under consideration is related with the\ncomplex target\u2013observer geometry. Since the object maneuvers are\ngiving rise to abrupt changes in the down-range extent measurements,\na filter with augmented (state and static parameters ) vector has longer\ntransient periods and higher peak dynamic errors. It additionally\ndecreases the accuracy of the target extent estimate. The influences\nof target maneuvers to size parameters evaluation can be reduced\nby implementing two different algorithms for state and parameters\nestimation.\nThe main contributions of this correspondence are in the estima-\ntion of parameters of nonpoint targets while tracking them. The added\nvalues and innovative aspects of this work as compared to previous in-\nvestigations include the following:\ni) proposition of two different algorithms for state and parameters\nestimation, accounting for specifics of this task;\nii) formulation of the problem for parameter estimation in PCDL\nform; this enables us to formulate the problem as parameter es-\ntimation of linear Markovian jump systems;\niii) estimation of the parameters with a data augmentation (DA)\nalgorithm, with a mixture Kalman filter modified (MKFm) and\na particle filter (PF).\nThe performance of the algorithms is assessed in terms of accuracy and\ncomputational complexity. We demonstrate that the DA algorithm out-\nperforms the MKFm with respect to accuracy but is more computation-\nally expensive. The developed MC techniques can be used in different\ntracking problems, where the extended target measurements are non-\nlinear related to the target parameters of interest, such as maritime and\nground targets\u2019 surveillance.\nThe first developed technique combines the advantages of an IMM\nfilter and of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. The\nidea of combining the multiple model approach with MCMC for finite\nmixture estimation is present in a different application [11] dealing with\njoint estimation of system states and transition probabilities of linear\njump Markov systems.\nThe object kinematic states (position and speed) are estimated in\nour correspondence by an IMM filter. The DA algorithm for estima-\ntion of finite mixture distributions [5] is proposed for shape parameter\nevaluation. Also, a PF for size parameters computation is designed and\nimplemented with the IMM filtering scheme. In addition, we formulate\nthe system model in a PCDL form through a measurement coordinate\nsystem conversion and discretisation of the continuous set of object\nparameters. As a result, we propose an alternative strategy, based on\nthe MKF [1], [12] and [13, ch. 11]. The developed MKFm generates\nrecursively samples of indicator variables and integrates out the linear\nand Gaussian state variables conditioned on these indicators. Due to the\nmarginalization, the MKFm is more accurate than the conventional PF\nand performs the state and parameter estimation in a common sequential\nMC framework. This is achieved by two latent indicator variables char-\nacterizing, respectively, the motion regimes and size type. An additional\nstatistical model validation scheme is incorporated into the MKFm to\nconfirm or reject the critical model, based on the measured data.\nThe correspondence is organized as follows.

Position of the ship versus the position of the observer.\nII. SYSTEM DYNAMICS AND MEASUREMENT MODELS\nA. System Model\u2014General Form\nConsider the following model:\nxk = f (mk; xk\u00001; \u0012;wk) (1)\nzk = h(mk; xk; \u0012; vk); k = 1; 2; . . . (2)\nof a discrete-time jump Markov system, describing the object dynamics\nand sensor measurements where xk 2 n is the base (continuous)\nstate vector, with transition function f ; zk 2 n is the measurement\nvector with measurement function h, and \u0012 2 \u0002 is a vector, containing\nunknown static parameters. The noises wk and vk are independent\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian processes with characteristics\nwk \u0018 N (0;Q) and vk \u0018 N (0;R), respectively. The modal (dis-\ncrete) state mk 2 f1; 2; . . . ; sg is a first-order Markov chain with\ntransition probabilities pij Prfmk = j jmk\u00001 = ig; (i; j 2 )\nand initial probability distribution P0(i) Prfm0 = ig; i 2 , such\nthat P0(i) \u0015 0, and si=1 P0(i) = 1; k = 1; 2; . . . is a discrete time.\nConsider a base state vector xk = (xk; _xk; yk; _yk)0, where x and\ny specify the position of an extended object, namely a ship, with re-\nspect to an observer\u2019s position, assumed known; ( _x; _y) is the velocity\nin the Cartesian plane, centered at the observer\u2019s location (Fig. 1). All\npossible motion regimes s of the maneuvering ship are modeled by the\nmodal state variable m. The static parameter vector \u0012 = (`; \r)0 con-\ntains shape parameters: the major axis length ` of the ship ellipse and\nthe aspect ratio between the minor and major axes \r. Based on a prior\ninformation about ship types, we assume that \u0012 takes values from a\nknown discrete (size type) set \u0012 2 f\u00121; \u00122; . . . ; \u0012tg with known\nprior distribution: P\u0012 (i) Prf\u0012 = \u0012ig; i 2 f1; . . . ; tg.\nB. Measurement Equation\nSimilarly to [7] and [9], we assume that a high-resolution radar\nprovides measurements of range r, bearing \f to the object cen-\ntroid and the object down-range extent L along the observer\u2013object\nline-of-sight (LOS) (Fig. 1). Here, (X0; Y0) is the location of the\nobserver. The relationship between L and the angle \u001e between the\nmajor axis of the ellipse and the target\u2013observer LOS is given by\nL(\u001e) = ` cos2 \u001e+ \r2sin2(\u001e). If the target ellipse is oriented so\nthat its major axis is parallel to the velocity vector ( _x; _y) then the\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOL. 56, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2008 827\nalong-range target extent L(\u001e) can be written as a function of the state\nvector xk and \u0012 [7], [9] so that\nL(\u001e(xk)) = \u0012(1) cos2 \u001e(xk) + \u0012(2)2sin\n2\u001e(xk) (3)\nwhere \u001e(xk) = arctan((xk _yk \u0000 _xkyk)=(xk _xk + yk _yk)). For the\nmeasurement vector zk = (rk; \fk; Lk)0, the measurement function\nh(xk; \u0012) =\n(xk \u0000X0)2 + (yk \u0000 Y0)2\narctan((yk \u0000 Y0)=(xk \u0000X0))\nL(\u001e(xk))\n(4)\nin (2) is highly nonlinear. The considered problem has its own particu-\nlarities. Since the function f in (1) depends on the motion regimes only,\nthe state evolution is a priori independent on \u0012. The kinematic statesxk\nand the modal statesmk can be estimated approximately through r and\n\f, without using measurements ofL. This is the rationale for proposing\na separate algorithm for estimating xk and mk , like in the conven-\ntional tracking filters. The measurement function (4), and measurement\nvector, respectively, are split into two parts: zk = ((z1k)0; z2k)0, where\nz1k = (rk; \fk)\n0 is related to the kinematic states and z2k = Lk is related\nto the object shape. The shape parameters are estimated by the PF or\nDA based on the state estimate and z2k .\nC. System Model\u2014Partially Conditional Dynamic Linear Model\nThe general system model (1) can be presented in the form\nxk = F (mk)xk\u00001 +G(mk)wk(mk) (5)\nz1k = H(mk)xk + v\n1\nk(mk) (6)\nz2k = L (\u0012\u0015 ; xk) + v\n2\nk(\u0015k); k = 1; 2; . . . (7)\nwhere the modal (discrete) state mk 2 can be thought of as a first in-\ndicator variable. The second indicator variable \u0015k takes values from\nthe set t f1; 2; . . . ; tg with probability P (\u0015k = i j\u0015k\u00001) =\nP (\u0015k = i) = 1=t and represents the size type. The noises have\ncharacteristics: wk(mk) \u0018 N (0;Q(mk));v1k(mk) \u0018 N (0;R(mk))\nand v2k(\u0015k) \u0018 N (0; RL(\u0015k)). The matrices F ;G, and H are known,\nassuming that the indicator vector \u0003k = fmk; \u0015kg is known. Note\nthat is the set of the manoeuvring modes, whereas t is the set of\nindex numbers of the discretized extent parameter. After converting the\nmeasurements from polar (rk; \fk) to Cartesian (xk; yk) coordinates:\nz1k = (rk cos(\fk); rk sin(\fk))\n0\n, the measurement (6) becomes linear\nwith a simple measurement matrixH and with a covariance matrixRc\n[14, p. 399].\nConditioned on the modal state mk , (5) and (6) represent the DLM,\nand a KF can be applied for state and kinematic likelihood estimation.\nConditioned on the indicator variable \u0015k , the extent measurement like-\nlihood can be calculated by (7), using the KF state estimate. A joint\nlikelihood can be used to determine the most likely mode-size combi-\nnation in the MKF framework. The above system (5)\u2013(7) is referred to\nas a partially CDLM (PCDLM), since the nonlinear (7) takes part in\nthe extent likelihood computation.\nIII. PROBLEM FORMULATION\nThe goal is to estimate the state vector xk and the extent parameter\nvector \u0012, based on measured data Zk = fz1; z2; . . . ; zkg. If the pos-\nterior joint state-size probability density function (PDF)\np(xk; \u0012jZ\nk) = p(\u0012jxk; Z\nk)p(xkjZ\nk) (8)\ncan be calculated, then the required estimate is given by\nEfxk\u0012 jZ\nkg\n= xk\u0012p(\u0012jxk; Z\nk)p(xkjZ\nk)d\u0012dxk\n= \u0012p(\u0012jxk; Z\nk)d\u0012 xkp(xkjZ\nk)dxk\n= \u0010\u0012(xk)xkp(xkjZ\nk)dxk \u0019 \u0010\u0012(x^k)x^k (9)\nwhere \u0010\u0012(x^k) = E(\u0012jx^k; Zk) represents the expectation of the pa-\nrameter vector \u0012, and x^k EfxkjZkg. Denote the lth mode his-\ntory, realized by a Markovian jump system through time k as mlk =\nfml0;m\nl\n1; . . . ;m\nl\nkg; l = 1; . . . ; s\nk\n. The state posterior PDF is ob-\ntained as a Gaussian mixture with an exponentially increasing number\nof terms [14]\np(xkjZ\nk) =\ns\nl=1\np xkjm\nl\nk; Z\nk P mlkjZ\nk : (10)\nThe exponential growth of computations can be avoided by different\ncombinations of model histories. The generalized pseudo-Bayesian ap-\nproaches (e.g., GPB1 and GPB2) [14] consider all possible models in\nthe last one (two) sampling periods.\nThe IMM filter [14], [15] approximates the posterior state PDF\np(xkjZ\nk) \u0019\ns\nj=1\np(xkjmk = j;Z\nk)P (mk = jjZ\nk) (11)\nby using s working in parallel KFs where each KF utilizes a different\ncombination of the previous model-conditioned estimates. In the light\nof the considered problem, the IMM-DA and IMM-PF algorithms es-\ntimate the kinematic state based on part of the measurements ~Z (1;k) =\nfz11; z\n1\n2; . . . ; z\n1\nkg. Hence, this kinematic state estimate is obtained as a\nsum of mode-conditioned state estimates \u0016jk;\nx^immk \u0019\ns\nj=1\n\u0016jkP mk = jj\n~Z\n(1;k) (12)\nweighted by mode probabilities where\nP mk = j j ~Z\n(1;k)\n\/ p z1kjmk = j; ~Z\n(1;k\u00001)\nP mk = jj~Z\n(1;k\u00001)\n:\nThe state estimate x^immk is applied in (9), instead of xk , for size param-\neters evaluation\n\u0012^(x^k) Ef\u0012jx^k; Z\nkg = \u0010\u0012(x^k) = \u0012p(\u0012jx^k; Z\nk)d\u0012: (13)\nThe posterior PDF p(\u0012jx^k; Zk) in (13) can be approximated in dif-\nferent ways. Let us suppose that the shape parameter \u0012 is replaced by\n\u0012k , which evolves according to the Markovian model \u0012k = \u0012k\u00001+w\u0012k;\nw\u0012k \u0018 N (w\n\u0012\nk; 0;Q\n\u0012), where w\u0012k is an artificial noise with covariance\nmatrix Q\u0012 .

Thus, the task\nof size type determination is reduced to the well known finite mix-\nture estimation problem: for the mixture model (15) with known\ncomponent PDFs N (z2k;L(\u0012i; x^k); RL), one needs to estimate the\nunknown weight vector \u0019 = (\u00191; . . . ; \u0019t). At each time step k, the\nDA iteratively evaluates weights (\u0019(k) \u0019), using the joint PDF of\nmeasurements over a sliding window fz2k\u0000ws+1; z2k\u0000ws+2 . . . ; z2kg,\nwhere ws is the window size. The mixture component with a max-\nimum weight identifies the most probable ship type. The estimate of\nthe extent parameters can be calculated as a sum of the parameter\nvalues \u0012i (from the discrete set), weighted by mixture proportions:\n\u0012^k =\nt\ni=1 \u0019i(k)\u0012i.\nUnlike the PF and DA algorithms, which are implemented jointly\nwith an IMM filter (x^k = x^immk ), the MKFm provides estimates both\nof the system states and parameters. In contrast to (11), the MKFm\napproximates the posterior state PDF p(xkjZk) by a random mixture\nof N Gaussian distributions\np(xkjZ\nk) \u0019\nN\nj=1\n~w\n(j)\nk N x\n(j)\nk ;\u0016\n(j)\nk ; P\n(j)\nk (16)\nwhere the weights ~w(j)k incorporate the properties of the posterior PDF\nof the indicator vector. The Gaussian mixture parameters, (\u0016(j)k ; P\n(j)\nk ),\nrespectively, the estimated mean\u0016(j)k and state covariance matrixP\n(j)\nk ,\nare obtained by implementing a Kalman filter for a given mode history,\nas a part of the common mode-size type history.\nLet \u0003\n(j)\nk\u00001 = \u0003\n(j)\n1 ;\u0003\n(j)\n2 ; . . . ;\u0003\n(j)\nk\u00001 ; j = 1; . . . ; N be the\nset of indicator vectors, representing joint mode and size type his-\ntory up to time k \u0000 1.

The parameter\nestimate \u0012^k is closely related to the posterior indicator probability\nP (\u0015k = ijZ\nk), which can be estimated as\nP (\u0015k = ijZ\nk) \u0019\nN\nj=1\n1 \u0015\n(j)\nk = i ~w\n(j)\nk ; i = 1; . . . t (17)\nwhere 1( \u0001 ) is an indicator function such that 1(\u0015k = l) = 1, if \u0015k = l\nand 1(\u0015k = l) = 0, otherwise.

On receipt of a\nnew measurement zk , first the IMM algorithm (or MKF) is run with the\nprevious state and mode estimates to update the current estimates, using\nthe likelihood of kinematic measurements. Next, the current parameter\nestimate \u0012^k is found based on the previous, \u0012^k\u00001, the current state and\nmode estimates and the extent measurement likelihood, respectively,\nby the PF, DA scheme, or the MKF.\nIV. EXTENT PARAMETERS ESTIMATION BY DA\nThe mixture model is given by the observation of n independent\nrandom variables y1; . . . ; yn from a t-component mixture [5],\n(yk) =\nt\ni=1\n\u0019i i(yk); k = 1; . . . ; n (19)\nwhere the densities i; i = 1; . . . ; t are known or are known up to\na parameter. We consider the special case, where only the weights \u0019i\nhave to be estimated. The DA algorithm approximates the mixture pos-\nterior distribution relying on the missing data structure of the mix-\nture model. According to [5], the mixture model can always be ex-\npressed in terms of missing (or incomplete) data \u000e(k). The vectors\n\u000e(k) = (\u000e1(k); \u000e2(k); . . . ; \u000et(k)); k = 1; 2; . . . ; n with components\n\u000ei(k) 2 f0; 1g; i = 1; 2; . . . ; t are defined to indicate that the mea-\nsurement yk has density i(yk) [11]. The model is hierarchical with\nthe true parameter vector \u0019 of the mixture, on the top level. Hence, the\ndistribution p(\u000ej\u0019) of the missing data \u000e depends on\u0019, i.e., \u000e \u0018 p(\u000ej\u0019).\nThe observed data, y \u0018 p(yj\u0019; \u000e), are at the bottom level.\nStarting with an initial value \u0019(0), the algorithm implements a two-\nstep iterative scheme:\ni) at the iteration u; u = 0; 1; 2; . . ., generate \u000e(u) \u0018 p(\u000ejy; \u0019(u))\nfrom a multinomial distribution with weights proportional to the\nobservation likelihoods, \u000e(u)i (k) \/ \u0019\n(u)\ni i(yk);\nii) then, generate \u0019(u+1) \u0018 p(\u0019jy; \u000e(u)).\nSince the conjugate priors on \u0019 are with Dirichlet distributions\n(DD), D(\u000b1; . . . ; \u000bt) [5], \u0019(u+1) is generated according to the\nDDs with parameters, depending on the missing data. Bayesian\nsampling produces an ergodic Markov chain (\u0019(u)) with stationary\ndistribution p(\u0019jy). Thus, after u0 initial (warming up) steps, a set\nof U samples \u0019(u +1); . . . ; \u0019(u +U) are approximately distributed\nas p(\u0019jy). Due to ergodicity, averaging can be made with respect\nto time [5]. In the present implementation, the observation yk co-\nincides with the along-range extent measurement z2k \u0011 Lk and\ni(z\n2\nk) \u0011 N (z\n2\nk;L(\u0012i; x^k); RL); k = 1; 2; . . . ; n; . . ..

The MKF of Chen\nand Liu, applied to the extended object tracking, requires quite high-\ndimensional indicator sampling space \u0003k 2 \u0002 t, which increases\nthe computational time [1, ch. 11].\nMKFm for State and Size Parameters Estimation\n1) Initialization, k = 0; For j = 1; . . . ; N :\nsample m(j)0 \u0018 fP0(i1)gsi =1 and \u0015\n(j)\n0 \u0018 fP\u0012 (i2)g\nt\ni =1.

MODEL VALIDATION\nThe posterior indicator probabilities provide a relative measure for\nthe most probable behavior mode and size type at each time step k.\nWhen the detection of a particular object size type is important, a model\nvalidation scheme can be incorporated into the MKF framework as an\nadditional test to confirm or reject the existence of a certain size type.\n830 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOL. 56, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2008\nLet Z2k denote the random variable, associated with the scalar obser-\nvation z2k . According to [16], under the null hypothesis that the model\nM \u0012k = \u0012i is the correct one, the sequence fuk : k = 1; . . . ; ng\nwith uk p(Z2k \u0014 z2k jZk\u00001;M) is a realization of i.i.d. random\nvariables in the interval [0; 1]. By letting vk = \b\u00001(uk), where \b is a\nstandard normal cumulative distribution function, a sequence of inde-\npendent N (0; 1) random variables is generated. This result holds for\nany time series model and can be used to provide a direct statistical test\nof the adequacy of the model \u0012k = \u0012i. To obtain uk , it is necessary to\nintegrate out \u0012k by evaluating\nuk = p Z\n2\nk \u0014 z2k jZk\u00001; \u0012k p \u0012k jZk\u00001 d\u0012k:\nFor complex models, this integration cannot, in general, be car-\nried out analytically [16], but an estimate of uk can be ob-\ntained using a MC test as follows: a) a sample of particles\n\u0012\n(j)\nk ; j = 1; . . . ; N is generated from p(\u0012k jZk\u00001) and b) since\np(z2k jZk\u00001; \u0012(j)k ) = N (z2k;L(\u0012(j)k ; x^k); RL), the estimate [16]\np^ Z2k \u0014 z2k jZk\u00001; \u0012(j)k = 1\u0000\n1\n2\nerfc\n\u0002 z2k \u0000 L \u0012(j)k ; x^k =\np\n2RL\ncan be evaluated analytically, using the complementary error function\nerfc( \u0001 ). Then, an estimate of uk is given by\nu^k =\n1\nN\nN\nj=1\np^ Z2k \u0014 z2k jZk\u00001; \u0012(j)k :\nA Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test is applied to validate the Gaussianity of\nthe sequence fvk : k = 1; . . . ; ng. The null hypothesis is that the data\nhave a standard normal distribution and the alternative hypothesis is\nthat data does not have that distribution. The null hypothesis is rejected\nif the test is significant at the 5% level.\nVII. SIMULATION RESULTS\nThe performance of the designed algorithms is evaluated over\ntrajectories comprising uniform motions and abrupt maneuvers\n[a typical scenario is shown in Fig. 2(a)]. The observer is static,\nlocated at the origin of (x; y) plane. The initial target state is\nx0 = (10000;\u000016; 85 000;5:8)0. The object performs two turn\nmaneuvers with normal accelerations of \u00063.0 [m\/s2]. Its length is\n` = 50 [m], and the aspect ratio (between the minor and major\naxes) is \r = 0:2. The sensor parameters are as follows [9]: sam-\npling interval T = 0.2 [s]; the measurement error covariances\nalong range, azimuth and along-range extent are respectively:\nR = diagf52 [m]2; 0:22 [deg]2g and RL = 52 [m]2.\nRoot-mean squared errors (RMSEs) [14] are chosen as a measure\nof the algorithms\u2019 accuracy. Results from 100 Monte Carlo runs are\npresented below. The set of modal states contains s = 3 elements,\ncorresponding to motion models, the first of which is for nearly con-\nstant velocity motion. The next two models are matched to nearly co-\nordinated turn maneuvers with turn rates ! = \u00060:18 [rad\/s]. The tran-\nsition matrices F (m) in (5) have the form given in [14, p. 467], for\nthe case of known turn rate. We assume that \u0012 takes values from a\nset = f(30;0:15); (50;0:2); (70; 0:25); (100;0:3)g(t = 4), with\nequal initial probabilities. Note that \u00122 corresponds to the true \u0012.\nThe DA design parameters are chosen as follows [5], [10]: the sliding\nwindow size is ws = 160; the number of iterations is 150, and the\nFig. 2.

The mixture proportions\n\u0019i; i = 1; . . . ; 4, estimated over a single run, for k = 100 are given in\nFig. 4. PF results for N = 100, 300, 500 and 1000.\nFig. 2(b). It can be seen that DA identifies the true \u00122 with a probability\nof \u00192 \u0019 0:7. This result confirms the reliability of the algorithm for\nclassification tasks.\nThe MKFm is implemented with a sample size N = 200.\nThe posterior mode probabilities P (mk = i1 jZk); i1 =\n1; 2; 3; k = 1; . . . ; 300 are given in Fig. 2(c), and those of\nP (\u0015k = i2 jZ\nk); i2 = 1; 2; 3; 4; in Fig. 2(d). The switches be-\ntween manoeuvring modes (m = 2 and m = 3) reproduce well the\nleft and right turns performed by the extended object. The along-range\nobject extent measurements depend on target\u2013observer geometry and\nrapidly change during maneuvering phases. Fig. 2(d) shows that the\nposterior size type probabilities change due to the maneuvers, but the\nprobability P (\u0015k = 2 jZk), corresponding to the actual object size\n\u00122, remains maximum over the whole tracking interval.\nA PF for extent parameters estimation is designed with Np = 300\nparticles and Nthresh = Np=10. Initially, Np normally distributed par-\nticles (\u0012(j))Nj=1 are generated with mean, corresponding to the true \u0012.\nAfter that the particles are predicted according to the model, presented\nin Section III. Then the particle weights are evaluated using likelihoods\nof the received extent measurements and the \u0012^ estimate is calculated ac-\ncording to (14).\nComparative plots of the true and estimated ship parameters, `\nand \r, obtained by the IMM-DA, MKFm, and IMM-PF, are pre-\nsented in Fig. 3(a) and (b). The corresponding RMSEs are shown in\nFig. 3(c) and (d). The maximum speed RMSEs are approximately\n6.5 [m\/s].\n832 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOL. 56, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2008\nThe proposed algorithms produce simultaneously stable tracking\nand size estimates converging to the true parameters. The DA procedure\nprovides the most accurate results, since it processes the cumulative\n(in a window) measurement information which increases the computa-\ntional time. The relative computational time IMM-DA:MKF:IMM-PF\ncorresponds approximately to the proportions: 18:6:1. It should be\nnoted that the PF involves an additional \u201cartificial\u201d noise, necessary\nfor prediction. The proper choice of noise parameters can lead to a\ngood result. However, the PF aspect ratio RMSE slowly increases over\ntime [Fig. 3(d)]. This is observed over various scenarios and different\nsample sizes, as shown in Fig. 4. A similar tendency is indicated also\nin [9]. Taking this fact into consideration, we may conclude, that the\nMKFm provides a reasonable compromise between accuracy and com-\nputational time. The model validation scheme, incorporated within the\nMKFm, gives an additional size type information: if we are interested\nin the size type, which is not the true one, the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov\ntest certainly rejects this hypothesis. For example, if we want to check\nthe hypothesis \u00123 = \u0012true, the estimated test statistic ktest2 = 8\ndefinitely exceeds a 5% critical value of 1.36, since \u0012true \u0011 \u00122.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nA suboptimal solution to the problem of extended object tracking\nis proposed in this correspondence. MC algorithms (DA, MKFm and\nPF) are developed for the object extent parameter estimation, based\non positional and along-range object extent measurements. The kine-\nmatic states are estimated with an IMM filter and with a MKFm, re-\nspectively. The approach of separation of states from parameters is im-\nplemented in the IMM-DA and IMM-PF. The overall state vector has a\ndecreased dimension compared with the joint state-parameter estima-\ntion, the type of maneuver can be identified relatively quickly, and the\nkinematic states are estimated with small peak dynamic errors. The de-\nveloped techniques offer a reasonable trade-off between accuracy and\ncomputational time and successfully deal with the complex target-ob-\nserver geometry.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers and the\nAssociate Editor for their constructive comments and suggestions.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.

Liavas, Member, IEEE\nAbstract\u2014We consider the sensitivity of the transmit multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) Wiener filter with respect to channel and noise\nsecond-order statistics (SOS) uncertainties. Using results from matrix\nperturbation theory, we derive second-order approximations to the excess\nmean-square error (EMSE) induced by using the channel or noise SOS\nestimates as if they were the true quantities. Assuming optimal training\nand sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we develop simple and\ninformative approximations to the EMSE, which indicate that the channel\nestimation errors are much more significant than the noise SOS estimation\nerrors. Uncertainties due to channel time variations induce EMSE that\nincreases with increasing SNR and asymptotically tends to a constant\nvalue.\nIndex Terms\u2014Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems,\npre-equalization, Wiener filtering.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nJoint optimization of transmit and receive filters for combatting\nfrequency selectivity and\/or interstream interference in multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) or multiuser systems has been extensively\nstudied (see, for example, [1] and the references therein). In order to\nkeep the mobile units as simple as possible, we may consider separate\ntransmit or receive processing. The transmit matched filter (TxMF),\nthe transmit zero-forcing filter (TxZF) and the transmit Wiener filter\n(TxWF) are three linear pre-equalization (or precoding) structures\nthat combat frequency selectivity and\/or interstream interference and\nkeep the receivers simple, because the only processing required at the\nreceiver is a scalar scaling [1], [2].\nThe TxWF, which outperforms the two other structures in terms of\nmean-square error (MSE) and bit-error rate (BER) [1], can be com-\nputed if the channel and the input and noise second-order statistics\n(SOS) are perfectly known at the transmitter.
