Recent events in the UK and other countries have shown that flooding is a widespread\nhazard that is not merely restricted to people living on the coast or near rivers. Flooding is\noften attributed to building developments on flood-plain areas, combined sewer overflows\n(Environment Agency, 2003; Evans et al., 2004) and climate change (Stern, 2006). Current\napproaches to flood preparation involve shared responsibility and have several main\ncomponents. At the national level, a range of flood risk management measures need to be in\nplace, including planning and development controls, physical defences, plans for managed\nretreat and automated warnings for vulnerable communities. Government, regulators and\ninsurance companies need to plan financially for flood events. Next, and the focus of this\nstudy, is individual level preparation reflecting psychological and behavioural adaption, as\ndemonstrated at the household level in some recent studies (e.g. Brown & Damery, 2008;\nScolobig, Broto & Zabala, 2008), relevant also to strategic priorities (Tunstall, Johnson and\nPenning-Rowsell, 2004).\nEmpirical studies of perceptions of, and responses to, floods yield three important\nfindings that form a background to this study. The first is that an individual\u2019s experience of\nflooding and their purchase of domestic flood protection devices are not necessarily linked\n(e.g. Blanchard Boehm et al., 2001). Flood experience is neither a necessary, nor sufficient,\nincentive for domestic flood protection. The second issue is one of agency and responsibility\nwhereby there is appropriate allocation of responsibility between the State and individuals\n(Parker, Priest, Schildt & Handmer, 2008). The third is that communication about flooding\nneeds to be built on an understanding of residents\u2019 perceptions of flooding and receptiveness\nto information (Krasovskaia, 2001). Communication also needs to take into account the first\ntwo points.\n4Here, we are concerned with how best to encourage individual uptake of domestic\nflood protection. Our data represent one of the largest UK quantitative studies of individual\nlevel perceptions of flooding. The insights raise implications for theoretical developments\nabout property protection, as well as providing information for communicators and policy\nmakers. We focus on individual psychological factors that influence individual decisions\nabout preventative flood risk management. We consider psychological factors since they are\nrelevant to understanding individual choices about flood protection because beliefs,\nperceptions and interpretations of experiences are important precursors to behaviour. Their\ncombined effects form a lens through which information is interpreted. Working in with this\napproach, we examine three sets of possible antecedents to flood protection purchase:\nperceived responsibility and agency, and the related factor of willingness to pay for flood\ndefences; perceptions of flooding; the interaction between information content and\npresentation with individual differences, and the links with subsequent action. We address\nthree research questions:\n1. What are the antecedents of domestic flood protection and the perceived challenges of\npurchasing domestic flood protection?\n2. What are the antecedents of responsiveness to flood related information?\n3. What are the optimal ways to present flood risk information?\nPerceived responsibility, agency and individual action\nFlooding presents a challenge to residents, policy makers and institutions tasked with\nenvironmental responsibilities. A key theme is the sharing of responsibility and cost for risk\nmanagement. Individual home owners face an important choice when considering whether to\ninitiate action to protect their home from flooding. Until recently, the prevailing paradigm\ninvolved reliance by the individual upon the State or institutionally funded and organised\nschemes (Bickerstaff & Walker, 2002; Bradbury, 1989, Kerr, 2003). This paradigm has been\n5eroded over the past few years due to two developments. The first concerns the way that\npeople think about the concept of risk. This debate owes much to the works of Beck (1992)\nand Giddens (1990) who claim that modern risks are diffuse, transcending geographical or\nnational divisions and creating challenges for the allocation of responsibilities for the\nreduction or prevention of negative consequences. Thus, since risk itself has changed,\napproaches to risk management and mitigation also need to change. The second development\nconcerns flooding specifically. Recent events in the UK and other countries have shown that\nflooding is a widespread hazard not restricted to people living on the coast or near rivers, due\nto overloading of urban drainage systems (Evans et al., 2004). Furthermore, flood damage has\nbeen considerable since existing flood prevention schemes and drainage systems have not\nbeen substantial enough to cope with rising waters or rain fall events. There is increasing\nawareness for the need for flood management, rather than prevention, with roles for the State,\nregulators and individuals (Johnson & Priest, 2006).\nTaken together, these factors have contributed to the development of collaborative\napproaches to flood management that bring together institutions and individuals and consider\nflood management as a joint responsibility (Johnson et al., 2005; Johnson & Priest, 2008;\nPenning-Rowsell et al., 2006). The constructs of responsibility and agency are useful since\nthey are important precursors to action. Responsibility is concerned with both a sense of\nmoral duty and belief that action must be taken (Eden, 1993). Agency refers to a sense that\none is able to take effective action (Eden, 1993). To take action, home owners need to accept\nit is their responsibility to protect their home rather than the responsibility of institutions of\nthe State (Rose, 1999), and believe that their actions will have positive, meaningful\nconsequences. Eden (1993) suggested important links between a perceived ability to influence\nwhat is broadly characterised as \u2018the environment\u2019, a sense of personal responsibility, and\nsubsequent action. Several factors that influence agency and responsibility have been\nidentified. There must be a recognisable agent or cause for responsibility to be attributed\n6(Bickerstaff & Walker, 2002). Self-efficacy (i.e. belief in their ability to carry out actions\nsuccessfully) increases preventive behaviours due to beliefs that actions can be effective\n(Murray-Johnson et al., 2004; Witte, 1992). Self-responsibility is also relevant, for similar\nreasons (Takao, 2006). However, the relationship between flood protection and its\nantecedents is not straightforward.\nHarries (2008) noted that many people in flood-risk areas do not have domestic flood\nprotection. Even when residents have experienced a flood, the majority do not purchase flood\nprotection. This could be due to real cost barriers, as well as psychological factors. Harries\n(2008) used the lens of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs (1943) to suggest a tendency not to\naccept responsibility for protecting the home since the need to feel secure runs counter to the\nacceptance of a need to defend the home against hazards. This creates dissonance which tends\nto be resolved by discounting the flooding risk (Burningham, Fielding & Thrush, 2008), or by\nshifting responsibility to government. De Marchi et al., (2007) found a progressive erosion in\nthe culture of self-protection among people in the Italian Upper Adige\/Sarca river basin; an\narea prone to flash floods, torrent rivers and inter-related events. Residents reported feeling\nprotected by the presence of flood and debris flow protection systems, even though these\ndefences had been overcome during recent floods. There was widespread opinion that the cost\nof flood protection and public safety were the responsibility of government rather than the\nindividual, thus individuals often chose not to protect their properties from flooding. A third\nrelated response is willingness to pay for institutions to provide flood protection thus inferring\nthe transfer of responsibility from the individual home owner to institutions and regulators.\nFor example, N\u00e6ss, Bang, Eriksen & Vevatne (2005) found that institutional flood protection\nschemes provided only weak incentives for local flood initiatives as there was seen to be less\nneed for individual action. A similar process could function at the individual level: people\nmight prefer to pay for flood defences than accept the responsibility for protecting their own\nhome. Furthermore, transference of responsibility via flood insurance is also complex.\n7Insurance could preclude further domestic protection (Blanchard-Boehm et al, 2007), and can\nbe unlikely to be purchased voluntarily when flood defences are in place (Hung Chih, 2009).\nThus research into responsibility and agency, reviewed above, has shown that these are salient\nissues that merit their exploration along with additional, relevant constructs.\nPerceptions of flooding and flood-related risk\nRisk perception is strongly associated with subsequent preventive action (Slovic,\nFischhoff & Lichtenstein, 1982). Risk perception could also influence sense of responsibility\nand agency: if a hazard is perceived as serious enough, it could increase the likelihood of\nindividual level beliefs that personal action is both required and efficacious (Krewski, Slovic,\nBartlett, Flynn & Mertz, 1995). Some empirical research has examined the associations\nbetween perceptions of flood risk and individual action. The high-risk, low-frequency nature\nof flooding events is important to consider. Kunreuther and Pauly (2004) demonstrated that\npeople tend to underestimate the likelihood of low frequency events of various kinds. This\nbias also relates to flooding. Siegrist and Gutscher (2006) examined lay and expert risk\nperceptions in Switzerland and showed that perceptions of both groups varied within and\nacross high and low risk flood zones. Further, they observed both over- and under-estimation\nof risk in all zones leading to a mismatch between flood prevention, perceived risk and\nassessments of risk likelihood. Some participants were too concerned and had made higher\nlevels of investment in flood protection than risk assessments warranted; whereas others in\nhigh risk areas were unconcerned and under-prepared. A similar result was found in the\n\u2018Flows\u2019 project (Floodplain Land use Optimising Workable Sustainability; 2002-2006) which\nrecommended regular assessment of public perception of flood prone areas since people in\nthese areas seem generally unconcerned about flooding and showed limited involvement in\nflood risk management issues. Takao and colleagues\u2019 study of 2051 residents following the\nTokai flood in 2000 in Japan showed that preparedness for flood events was determined, in\n8part, by experience of flooding: worse experiences were associated with greater protection (in\ncontrast to Harries, 2008), particularly when combined with property ownership and fear of\nflooding. Anticipation of future floods, by itself, did not influence flood protection (Takao,\nMotoyoshi, Sato & Fukuzono, 2004; Takao, 2006).\nIn summary, there does not seem to be a consistent, positive relationship between\nflood experience and flood mitigation via purchase of domestic flood protection. Furthermore,\nthere are individual differences in how risk perception influences flood protection for both lay\npeople and experts. However, the literature on flood perception suggests that preventive\naction could be enhanced when risk perceptions and assessments of risk likelihood are\naligned. One way to achieve alignment is through risk communication.\nResponsiveness to Risk Communication and Information\nFlood risk communication and the responsiveness of the individual to such\ncommunication is an important aspect to flood protection and mitigation behaviours. The\nprinciple of such communication is that if people are provided with information they will be\nable to act upon it. One programme incorporating this principle is the Japanese Participatory\nFlood Risk Communication Support System (Pafrics) (Fukuzono at al, 2006). This has\nachieved some success in increasing people\u2019s knowledge about flooding by providing\ninformation via a computerised flood risk literacy programme and workshops.\nHowever, because effective communication is seldom a passive process, information\nprovision alone is insufficient to change behaviour. For example, Krasovskaia et al. (2001)\nfound that fewer than 50% of participants were ready to obey orders from the authorities, e.g.\nto evacuate their homes. The authors suggested that this is because people do not perceive the\nreal dangers of flooding, and cite similar research into hurricane evacuation (Aguirre, 1991;\nGladwin & Peacock, 1997). McCarthy\u2019s recent work (McCarthy, 2007; McCarthy et al.,\n2007) found that flood communication can increase individual level responses when there are\n9effective partnerships in place between the expert information providers and the lay receivers.\nIn order for change to occur, people need to be receptive to information (Lion, Meertens &\nBot, 2002), and their receptiveness depends on several factors. One factor is risk perception\nVenkatraman, Aloysuis and Davis (2006) showed that people were more receptive to hazard\ninformation when they perceived it to be serious and likely, thus attention was focused on\nsalient information that could guide beneficial behaviour.\nA second important factor that influences responses to information campaigns is trust\n(Slovic, 1993). Trettin and Musham (2000) suggested that erosion of public trust in\ngovernment agencies could be a major constraint on the success of risk communication. In the\nUK, since its inception, the Environment Agency has embarked on an effective programme of\nflood risk management and communication. It has radically overhauled the messages and\nmeans of communication for flood prone communities (Speller, 2005). Parker et al., (2008)\nsuggested that working with people in flood-prone communities would increase their trust in\nthe Environment Agency due to improved knowledge of flood protection processes as well as\nproviding an opportunity for input into local initiatives. This approach could also increase the\nlikelihood of responsiveness to official information and individual-level flood protection.\nThird, the medium and mode of information are important. Krasovskaia et al. (2001)\nshowed that the preference of a Norwegian sample of the general public was a combination of\nlocal and national TV and radio. However, older and less educated people preferred direct\ncontact with authorities. Younger and more educated participants preferred the internet. The\nmode of information presentation is also important. Keller, Seigrist and Gutscher, (2006)\nfound that information presented in a frequency format as well as probabilities given for\nlonger time periods was more effective in emphasising the threat of a risk than short term\nprobabilities. A recent study by Lumbroso, et al. (2009) showed that probabilistic information\npresentation was rated most useful by Environment Agency flood incident management\nemployees since it enables preparations for floods. However, the authors acknowledged that it\n10\nis hard to identify the optimal form of information presentation since information is perceived\nthrough an individual, organisational or societal interpretive lens.\nOverall, models of individual level flood protection behaviour that include experience\nof flooding, perceived risk and trust have received some empirical support. Furthermore,\nmodels of risk communication suggest that local input into information systems is important.\nThere is also evidence of insufficient preparation for flood events (Siegrist & Gutscher, 2006;\nTakao and colleagues, 2004, 2006) indicating a critical gap for a research model that\nintegrates the individual and contextual variables relating to individual level flood protection.\nMethod\nThe study was designed to assess the range of constructs using a large and diverse\nsample group of people who have signed up to participated in research in exchange of points\nredeemable against high street goods. Recruitment was via the ipoints market research\ndatabase since this provided rapid access to people throughout the UK. Participants were\ninvited by email to complete the questionnaire on-line. There were 2,109 UK respondents\n(51.4% men, 48.4% women, 3 participants did not report their gender; mean age = 43.4 years;\nsd = 13.0). Participants were all home owners and had a ground floor level to their property.\nParticipants came from a range of educational and occupational backgrounds. There was a\nrange of ethnic groups. 93.2% of participants reported to be White, 4% Asian, 1.1% of mixed\nethnic background and 0.4% Black. 1.3% reported to be of other backgrounds than those\ncategories given.\nThe survey had five sections. Section one assessed biographical factors (e.g. age,\ngender). Section two asked participants to report a range of flood-related experiences: whether\nthey lived in a flood zone; whether their home had been flooded, and whether they owned\nflood protection devices. A range of options was presented (e.g. sand bags, protection panels\nfor doors. These items were used to create the first dependent variable: whether participants\n11\nhad purchased domestic flood protection or not. Participants were then asked about the\nfactors that influenced their decision to protect their home, e.g. cost of buying and difficulty\nin installing. These items were aggregated to form the second dependent variable: challenges\nin protection purchase. Section three assessed antecedent variables: perceived seriousness of\nflooding; trust in government; and trust in scientists to manage flood problems. Items also\nassessed responsibility and agency by asking respondents to rate responsibility of regulators\nto solve problems of flooding, responsibility of scientists to prevent flooding, and the value of\nmonetary contributions participants were willing to make toward local and UK-wide flood\nprotection. Section four assessed perception of information. Participants rated availability of\ninformation regarding domestic flood protection, and responses to different types of\ninformation presentation styles. Participants were asked how they would like information\nabout flood risks to be communicated to them (e.g. via TV news, local papers). Section five\nexamined responsiveness to information. Participants were given the opportunity to click on\nheadings and read additional information about several aspects of flooding: flood risk, health\nrisks associated with flooding, preventive action, likelihood of future flooding, flood location.\nAfter reading the information, participants were asked to rate the extent to which the\ninformation was useful; their intentions to purchase flood protection devices; how costly it\nwas for them to install flood protection; and how beneficial they thought installation of flood\nprotection might be.\nResults\nThree analytical strategies were used to examine the data. First, we examined\nfrequencies of responses for our main variables of interest. We compared mean scores for\ncategories of respondents using independent samples T-tests and oneway analysis of variance\ntests. We have also used binary logistic regression to examine antecedents of flood protection\n12\npurchase, and linear multiple regression to examine antecedents of perceived accessibility of\nflood protection. The regression data are not reported here in the interests of brevity, however,\nresults are available from the authors.\nDomestic flood protection purchase and its antecedents\nThe majority of participants indicated they had no flood protection (N = 1732, 82.1%).\nOf those that had bought domestic flood protection, the most popular choice was water\nrepellent sealer for brick or stone walls (N=166, 7.9%). Also relatively common were sand\nbags (N=100, 4.7%), seals to prevent backflow from toilets (N=99, 4.7%), and seals for\ngarage doors (N=93, 4.4%). Some participants had airbrick protection panels (N=69, 3.3%)\nand door protection panels (N=66, 3.1%). 21 (1.0%) participants listed alternatives, for\nexample digging additional drainage. Overall, flood protection purchases covered the range of\noptions presented in the survey, yet purchasers only represented a small section of the sample.\nIn terms of flood experience, 1845 (87.5%) participants reported their home had never\nflooded. 106 people (5%) said their home had flooded once, and 42 (2.0%) reported their\nhome had flooded more than once. To investigate the interaction of flood experience and\nflood protection, we calculated the frequency for each combination: 105 people (5.3%) had\nhome protection and a history of flooding; 230 respondents (11.5%) had home protection and\nno history of flooding; 43 (2.2%) individuals had no home protection yet a history of\nflooding; and 1615 (81.0%) people had no home protection and no history of flooding.\nOverall, almost a third of the people that had experienced a flood had not purchased domestic\nflood protection. There is a cautious segment of the sample which has bought flood protection\ndespite no history of flooding. Yet the majority was people who are potentially at risk of\nflooding and have no protective devices.\nAnalysis of the demographic factors associated with flood protection purchase showed\nthat people who had bought flood protection devices were younger, more educated and higher\n13\nearners than those who have not. Data suggest that there seem to be cost barriers that prevent\ndomestic flood protection purchase in addition to psychological factors associated with the\ndecision to purchase flood protection. Next we examined factors relating to perceived\nchallenges of flood purchase for the entire sample. Participants were grouped into low,\nmedium and high scores. Figure 1 shows the results for each group.\nINSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE\nMean scores of antecedent variables were compared for each group using a oneway\nanalysis of variance. Data showed that people most likely to perceive challenges associated\nwith purchasing domestic flood protection were younger, more worried, believe that it is the\nresponsibility of scientists to solve flooding problems; trust the government to manage\nflooding. These participants were more also willing to pay for local and national flood\ndefences (not represented on the chart due to differences in scaling). We also examined the\nassociates of domestic flood protection purchase. The data are summarised in Figure 2 below.\nINSERT FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE\nIndependent samples T Tests were used to compared the two groups. People who have\npurchase domestic flood protection were younger; more likely to perceive that the risk of\nflooding is serious; to believe that it is the responsibility of scientists to solve flooding\nproblems; to trust the government to manage flooding; and be more willing to pay for local\nand national flood defences. However, this group was less likely to believe that it is the\nresponsibility of regulators to solve flooding problems, or that relevant information is\navailable .\nIn brief, these results suggest that there are some enablers associated with purchase,\nsuch as youth and perceived seriousness. In contrast, there are some barriers to action, e.g.\nlack of information and belief in regulators\u2019 responsibility to manage flooding problems.\nInterestingly, three enablers also could be barriers since they were significant to both\ndependent variables: youth, perceived seriousness and willingness to pay for local flood\n14\ndefences. We explored this in further analysis.\nNext, we repeated the regression analyses of the perceived challenges of flood\npurchase for subgroups within the sample based: first, on whether the participants rated\nthemselves as living in a flood zone and, second, whether they had experienced a flood or not.\nThis enabled us to examine whether there were differences in the antecedents of perceptions\nabout flood protection while accounting for beliefs about flood risk and experience of\ndomestic flooding. There were several significant findings for perceived challenges of flood\nprotection purchase and actual protection purchase. Again, perceived seriousness and youth\nemerged as key factors. Availability of information, the role of regulators and scientists, trust\nin government and willingness to pay for flood defences were also significant.\nResponsiveness to flood related information and its antecedents\nParticipants were presented with five opportunities to look at additional information\nabout flooding. These items enabled us to examine responsiveness to flood-related\ninformation, and the antecedent factors that were associated with responsiveness. Only 320\npeople (15.2%) chose to look at the additional information suggesting that the majority of\nparticipants were not responsive to flood-related information. Of those that did choose to look\nat the additional information, the most popular choice (N=264) was the extra information on\nflood risk which linked participants directly with the Environment Agency website where\nthey could check the estimated flood risk of their property. After reading the information only\n8 people said that they would install flood protection devices in their home in the next three\nmonths and 63 people said that they might. The second highest chosen information choice\nconcerned flood location (N=253) which achieved 6 \u2018yes\u2019 and 65 \u2018perhaps\u2019 answers to\ninstalling flood protection within the next 3 months.\nThe information that had the highest number of people (N=10) agreeing to put flood\nprotection devices in their homes within the next 3 months was the information on health risks\n15\nand flooding (N=209). A further 57 people said that they would consider it. This was\nfollowed by information on domestic flood protection (N=218) with 9 \u2018yes\u2019 and 63 \u2018perhaps\u2019\nanswers. The information on future flooding (N=211) yielded the least number of \u2018yes\u2019 (N=8)\nand \u2018perhaps\u2019 (N=55) answers. When asked about the perceived costs and benefits of fitting\nflood protection devices after reading each piece of information, the mean score for costs was\ngreater than the mean score for benefits in every case. In summary, these data suggest that\nmost of the sample were not responsive to reading this type of flood-related information. The\nrelatively small proportion of the sample that did read the information were not influenced by\nthe information to consider purchasing flood protection devices, and the perceived costs of\ndoing so outweighed the perceived benefits. These data indicate that information alone is\ninsufficient to promote behavioural change.\nWe explored the data to examine whether there were significant differences in our\ndependent variables that might influence responsiveness to information. Of those that looked\nat additional information, only 18 (5.9%) had previously been flooded and 44 people (11.7%)\nhad already got flood protection installed in their homes. These small percentages indicate\nthat there are some people who have not experienced floods or protected their home who are,\nor have potential to be, receptive to flood-related information. The antecedents of\nresponsiveness to information were examined. Participants who looked at the extra\ninformation were younger; trusted scientists; and believed that flood management was\nregulators\u2019 responsibility. The data support our previous findings: there seems to be an\nimportant interaction between perceived responsibility of regulators and personal choices\nabout information seeking that could guide personal action.\nOptimal modes of information presentation\nNext we considered communication of flood risk information by examining responses\nto different modes of information presentation. We asked participants whether they have\n16\nlooked at the Environment Agency website to gauge their flood risk. 418 (19.8%)\nparticipants have looked at flood zone information on the Environment Agency\u2019s website\nwithin the past year; 401 (19.0%) have looked at the information more than a year ago, and\n1290 (61.2%) have never looked. 164 people (7.8%) reported living in a flood zone; 543\n(73.2) said that they did not live in a flood zone, and 402 (19.1%) were unsure. Given that\nfewer than one-fifth of the sample have looked at the EA website, the data indicate that\nfurther advertisement of this service could benefit homeowners and might contribute to\nindividual-level flood management.\nWe also examined the format of information presentation focusing on frequency\ninformation. Participants were asked to rank four equivalent statements in order of their\nutility, 1 being the most useful and 4 being the least useful. The most useful statement was\n\u2018On average the property will flood once in every 50 years\u2019 (mean rank = 1.75). Next was\n\u2018The odds of flooding in any year are fifty to one\u2019 (mean rank = 2.04). Third was \u2018The\nprobability of flooding in any year is 0.02\u2019 (mean rank = 2.87). Least useful was \u2018The\nproperty is on the fifty year return flood level\u2019 (mean rank = 3.07). Next, participants were\nasked to select their preferred communication channels from a range of options presented.\nThe list included television, radio, print and internet media, and participants could choose as\nmany options as they wished. The preferred media were national television news (2180,\n72.6%), newspapers (1563, 52.1%), radio news (1087, 36.2%), and government\nrecommendations (997, 33.2%).\nDiscussion\nWe examined home owners\u2019 choice of engagement with flood mitigation through\npurchase of equipment to protect their home from flooding and perceived challenges of\nprotection purchase. Perceived seriousness of flood risk and youth were repeatedly significant\nto both accessibility of flood risk information and domestic flood protection. Critically, these\n17\nfactors operated differently for the dependent variables. Youth and seriousness were\nassociated with perceived challenges of flood protection suggesting that there could be a\ngeneralised perception of difficulty and risk. Yet, high levels of both factors were associated\nwith domestic flood protection. Young people with a long home-owning future ahead are\nlikely to see more value in protecting their homes. Furthermore, these data confirm prior\nevidence that perceived severity of risk is important to action (e.g. Krewski et al., 1995;\nSlovic et al., 1982).\nThe differential effect of seriousness on challenges associated with domestic flood\nprotection and actual flood protection purchase is a novel finding, and an important\ncontribution of this study to the literature. While the importance of responsibility and agency\nsupports prior research (Murray-Johnson et al., 2004; Takao, 2006; Witte, 1992), data also\nindicated that responsibility and agency could be a cause of the differential functioning of age\nand seriousness. People who rated the responsibility of regulators as low were more likely to\nperceive flood protection devices as available and to have purchased them. Thus there was an\nimportant interaction between acknowledgement that regulators cannot be fully responsible\nfor protecting home owners from flooding, beliefs that protective devices are available, and\naction to purchase them. Also related to responsibility and agency was the willingness to pay\ncontributions to local and UK-wide flood defences. Here, there were positive responses that\nrelated to both perceived challenges of flood purchase and actual purchase. As with perceived\nseriousness, there could be important differences in the functioning of willingness to pay. For\nsome participants, willingness to pay was associated with generalised beliefs about the\ndifficulty of domestic flood protection and responsibility of institutions to manage flood risk.\nPaying for large scale defences could be a strategy to reduce the dissonance caused by\nawareness that homes are susceptible to flooding and other damaging events and not simply\nsafe havens (Harries, 2008). Other respondents took responsibility for their own domestic\nflood protection and were also willing to contribute to flood defences to reduce flood risk.\n18\nExperience of flooding also had a significant impact on the choice to protect the home.\nIt seems that the experience could change people\u2019s thinking about whether they could and\nshould protect their home from flooding, or whether regulators and scientists have\nresponsibility. This supports prior research, notably Blanchard-Boehm et al., (2001). While\nthe relationship between a positive view of scientists, regulators and flood protection is good\nfor the scientific and regulatory communities, it also highlights a potential problem of\nresponsibility. In the current study, people who have experienced a flood were less worried\nabout flooding than those with no experience. Although pre-experience and post-experience\ndata are not available in this dataset, it is possible that individual-level concern changes as a\nresult of the experience of flooding, as suggested by Siegrist and Gutscher (2006). People\nwho have experienced flooding could become less concerned, no longer take personal\nresponsibility for protecting their home, and expect scientists to manage the problem. It is\npossible they believe that individual home owners are helpless in the event of floods.\nIn contrast, people who have not experienced flooding had a different set of beliefs\nthat influenced their decision to protect their home. While some of these participants might\nlive in areas that are unlikely to flood, for example hilly areas, this group is important since it\ntypically outnumbers people who have experienced a flood, and is a significant target\naudience for information campaigns. The most significant issue for this group was the\nacknowledgement that buying flood protection devices is difficult and costly, and devices can\nbe hard to install or use. They also perceived flooding as serious. As noted above, perceived\nseriousness can influence positive action when it is combined with beliefs about personal\nresponsibility, thus information campaigns could highlight these factors.\nParticipants without experience of flooding also believed that regulators have an\nimportant role in managing flooding. Related to the role of government and regulators, the\nwillingness to pay for flood protection data provided some useful results. There was a\ngenerally good level of support for central funding to build flood defences. While this is\n19\npositive in terms of acknowledgement of the problem and the need for flood defences to be\nfunded, it could also link with the lack of personal responsibility and efficacy, as noted above\nand found in prior research (Murray-Johnson et al., 2004; Witte, 1992).\nThe finding that most participants did not seek the additional information that was\nprovided revealed interesting differences between people who were receptive to information\nand those who were not, as well as the relative impact of different types of information. While\nsome participants were receptive to reading the information, the items had very little impact\non intended purchase of domestic flood protection. The data indicated that people who are\nreceptive to flooding information are those already concerned about issue. This effect has\nbeen noted in prior research (Del Missier, Ferrante, & Costantini, 2007). Cherubini et al.\n(2003) suggested that people do not focus on all the information they are provided with.\nInstead, people only focus on information that they believe to be relevant to them, and this\ncould be the case in the current study. Furthermore, concern alone is not likely to be enough\nto overcome the negative perceptions about the practical issues of buying and installing\ndomestic flood protection. These findings could relate to the difficulty in accepting that\nflooding is a hazard that is unpalatable yet personally relevant (Harries, 2008). Data from the\ncurrent study suggest that concern and perceptions of relevance could be requirements for\nattention to information and subsequent behavioural adaptation, and support prior research\n(Agirre, 1991; Gladwin & Peacock, 1997; Krasovkaia et al., 2001).\nOverall, there are several theoretical implications. First, data from the current study\nshowed that choice to purchase domestic flood protection can be understood by assessing a\nrange of factors including perceptions of flooding; personal responsibility; trust in, and\nresponsibility of, scientists and government\/regulators to manage flooding; and, perceived\naccessibility of information. The implication is that strategies designed to influence behaviour\ncould appeal to each of these factors. While increasing concern is not the goal of such a\nstrategy, it is important that people feel concerned enough to take action without being\n20\nconcerned to the point of distress. Nor should concern reach the point where the problem is\nperceived as too great to manage on an individual level. Flood-related communication could\nconvey the seriousness and relevance of flooding to homeowners while also including local\ninformation (McCarthy, 2007) that gives practical and detailed guidance.\nSecond, the data showed that agency, responsibility and experience of flooding had a\nsignificant impact on perceptions of, and beliefs about, domestic flood protection. In\nparticular, there was a shift in focus away from individual responsibility and towards external\nagencies, notably scientists. This emphasises the importance of agency and links with prior\nresearch. For example, De Marchi et al.\u2019s (2007) study of residents in a flood prone area of\nItaly found low levels of individual level domestic protection despite the failure of flood\nprevention systems. Hung-Chih (2009) found a similar pattern among Taiwanese participants.\nSelf-efficacy has been suggested as an important part of the cycle of communication and\nbehavioural adaptation: people need to believe their actions will have a positive consequence\n(Murray-Johnson et al., 2004; Witte, 1992). The corollary, supported by the current study, is\nthat models of flood protection behaviour need to integrate appropriate levels of concern with\na personal sense of agency and efficacy.\nThere are several practical implications of our findings. Participants acknowledged\nthat it is expensive to buy flood protection equipment. Furthermore, it can be difficult both to\nlocate and install the equipment. People who had bought flood protection were also younger,\nhigher earners and more educated. While the costs of such equipment are potentially a\nsignificant barrier to some people, it is likely that cost combined with low efficacy and\ndiffused responsibility create a more robust barrier to action. Perceived costs were related to\nbeliefs that it is the responsibility of scientists, government and regulators to manage flooding,\ni.e. the responsibility lies with external agents, not homeowners. It could be useful for\nnational flood protection schemes to include grants for low income households to purchase\nflood protection since the costs of grants would be low compared with post-flooding clean\n21\nups, as suggested by Kunreuther and Erwann (2009). However, financial motivation alone is\nunlikely to be sufficient for behavioural adaptation. Flood information and management\nsystems need to demonstrate genuine efficacy of domestic protection to increase\nresponsibility and agency.\nThe data also showed that information content and presentation were important to\nencourage active engagement with the message. Information that indicates the likelihood of\nfloods in specific areas could use straightforward presentation methods, such as one in every\n50 years, rather than probabilistic data since ease of understanding information relates\npositively to attend paid to it (Keller and Staelin, 1987; Keller et al. 2006; Pirolli & Card,\n1999; Sperber & Wilson, 1995). The current study also indicates that the efficacy of personal\naction to protect homes is another important component of an information campaign since\npeople need to know that they can take action to prevent their home flooding. They also need\nto know some details, such as the relative costs and benefits of different flood protection\nitems. These issues were strongly associated with choice to protect the home among the\nsample in this study. Communication campaigns could also be in the form of information on\nthe relative cost of home protection compared with the wide range of damages and costs\nassociated with flood risk to shift the cost:benefit ratio in favour of benefits (Levin, Gaeth,\nSchreiber & Lauriola, 2002). News items in TV, radio and newspapers would be effective\nmedia for communication.\nWhilst the current study has addressed a critical gap in the flooding literature by\nhighlighting the need to understand psychological variables such as perceptions, agency, and\nresponsiveness to information, there are some limitations and suggestions for future research.\nA larger sample could increase the number of people that have experienced flooding to yield\nmore substantial comparison groups, and focus on people in flood prone areas. Future\nresearch could also involve more in-depth testing of specific issues, such as the question of\nagency. The role of trust could also be researched further to establish the extent to which trust\n22\nin information sources is critical to attending to risk messages. Longitudinal studies that\ngather data before and after flood events would more accurately identify changes in\nperception and actions. Qualitative research would also add to understanding of the individual\nand contextual factors that influence flood protection, and the processes through which they\nact. Each of these developments could contribute to enhanced communication strategies.\nConclusions\nOur study has four main conclusions relating to our research questions. First,\nwe asked what are the antecedents of domestic flood protection? Data showed that there were\ntwo sets of factors. In demographic terms, people were most likely to have purchase flood\nprotection when they are younger, better educated and higher earners. The costs of flood\nprotection could be mitigated by grants or loans, however, it is important that an individual\nsense of responsibility or agency is maintained rather than a belief in reliance upon the State.\nIn attitudinal terms, participants purchased flood protection when they perceived flood risk to\nbe serious, and, critically, they had a sense of responsibility and agency. People need to\nbelieve that they can take action, and that their efforts are worthwhile. Experience of flooding\nseemed to reduce sense of responsibility and agency among some participants. Evidence of\nthe efficacy of flood protection could enhance positive attitudes towards flood protection,\nresponsibility and agency.\nSecond, we explored the antecedents of responsiveness to flood related information.\nParticipants who chose to access additional information about flooding were those already\nconcerned, however, reading the information did not change participants\u2019 intention to\npurchase flood protection. Information should promote an appropriate belief in susceptibility\nto flooding and beliefs in responsibility and agency to result in behavioural change.\nThird, we examined the optimal ways to present flood risk information. Many\nparticipants perceived information as unavailable. Readily accessible information via local\n23\nand national television and radio could help these groups of people. Information providing\nevidence of successful domestic flood protection and emphasising individual responsibility to\ntake action could yield increased action via the mechanisms discussed above.\nTo conclude, this study has shown that home owners are willing to protect their homes\nfrom flooding and, in many cases, to contribute to flood defences. However, home owners\nmust be aware of, and accept, their individual level responsibility to protect their homes. Such\nresponsibility is likely to occur when concurrent with strategic government initiatives to\nprovide both local and national flood defences. Furthermore, communication campaigns need\nto nurture a shared sense of responsibility in addition to providing accessible information\nabout low cost, effective domestic flood protection devices.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank colleagues involved in projects relating to this research: Professor\nMike Christie, Herriot Watt University; Dr Helen Clough, University of Liverpool; Dr Greg\nDavies, Barclays Wealth; Dr David Newman, Queen\u2019s University, Belfast; Dr Stephen Senn,\nUniversity of Glasgow.
