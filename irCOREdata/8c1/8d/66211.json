Hence, we define an e-\ncommerce firm as one that conducts its trade primarily through a digital infrastructure, including the \nInternet and related technologies. This definition adapts that of Coltman and colleagues (2000), with \nthe word \u2018primarily\u2019 replacing their phrase \u2018in whole, or in part\u2019, since the latter covers every \norganisation making even minor use of the technology.  \n  In the late 1990s few commentators could resist predicting that e-commerce and the Internet \nwould herald a revolution in the world of work (Leadbetter, 1999; Venkatraman, 2000). One such \ntransformation was to come from the widespread adoption of the apparently \u201cradical\u201d e-commerce \napproach to organisational design, operating principles and structures, and people management \n(Hoogervorst et al., 2002). E-commerce firms were lauded for their \u201cpractices that support \nautonomy, collaboration and innovation\u201d (Boudreau et al., 2001: 3), namely flatter organisational \nstructures, \u201cfluid and impermanent project-based\u201d job designs (UKonlineforbusiness, 2002: 7), more \ninformal and more inclusive decision-making, and reward schemes combining individualised and \ncollective incentives. Yet beyond stereotypical images of \u201cheroic teams of self-directed workers\u2026 \nnon-hierarchical surroundings\u2026 the vague promise of bounteous rewards from stock options and a \nculture of overwork and burnout\u201d (Ross, 2000), and spectacular tales of managerial excessii, little is \nknown about the actual HR strategies and practices inside such firms.  \nAgainst this background of scant information our primary research objective was to conduct \nan exploratory study into the use made by UK e-commerce firms of a standard set of human \nresource management (HRM) practices, and the evolution of such firms\u2019 approach to HR over time. \nIn examining our quantitative and qualitative data, we were interested in whether the so-called e-\ncommerce approach to HRM is as radically new as depicted, or whether the \u2018change\u2019 theme has \nbeen exaggerated. \nThe paper proceeds as follows. We first set our study within the frameworks provided by the \nliterature on HRM and employment relations in three relevant sectors: e-commerce firms \nthemselves, plus small-medium enterprises (SMEs: defined as firms with less than 250 employees) \nand stand-alone entrepreneurial ventures, since many e-commerce firms fall into either or both of \nthese categories.iii We then present the methodology and findings of our survey. Case study \nevidence complements the survey data with insights from senior managers within the sample on the \ne-commerce approach to HR. We discuss our findings in the conclusion.  \n  \nHR inside small-medium enterprises and entrepreneurial firms.  \nIn one sense, the nature of small firms\u2019 workplace relations, and HRM, is no different to \nlarger firms\u2019 in that it is highly context-specific, shaped to a considerable extent by the particular \ncombination of \u201csector, product and labour market\u201d forces facing the firm (Ram and Edwards, 2003: \n723). What ultimately materialises within this context is the product of a \u2018negotiated agreement\u2019 \nbetween the firm\u2019s owner, the firm\u2019s managers and the firm\u2019s employees, in a process of \u201cmutual \nadjustment\u201d (for a full discussion see Barrett and Rainnie, 2002; Ram and Edwards, 2003; Ram, \n1999a, 1999b).  \nThe overwhelming impression from the SME and entrepreneurial literatures is that within \nsuch firms this \u2018agreement\u2019 is typically \u201cfluid and flexible\u201d (Marlow, 2002), and tends to be \nconducted on an informal, reactive basis with a short-termist horizon (Matlay, 1999; Ram et al., \n2001; Wilkinson 1999). Small firms are much less structured and less professionalised in their \n 3\ninternal processes, policies and practices than their larger counterparts, and much less likely to \nengage in HR planning and sophistication (Koch and McGrath, 1996). To illustrate, of 117 \nrandomly selected American SMEs, just fifteen (12%) had an HR department (Heneman and \nBerkley, 1999, cited in de Kok and Uhlaner, 2001). \nSeveral different explanations have been proposed for this \u2018informality\u2019 and lack of \nstructured HRM. From within the firm, Marlow (2002) identifies the owner\u2019s \u201cstrategy for control\u201d \nas a decisive influence. Owners tend to want to impose their \u2018stamp\u2019 and personal management style \non internal matters, including the primary goal and orientation of the firm, its working conditions \nand policies, and the style of internal and external communication (Nooteboom, 1993), and how this \nis communicated to staff (Marlow and Patton, 1993). Many small firm owners profess a preference \nfor a \u2018team ethos\u2019, or \u2018family atmosphere\u2019, or \u2018fraternalism\u2019 (Goss, 1991) which, they fear, might be \nthreatened by the introduction of more formalised policies (Marlow, 2002). Indeed, Katz et al. \n(2000: 8) suggest that, in the eyes of most entrepreneurs, HR is synonymous with \u201cbureaucracy, \npolicies, procedures and paperwork\u201d.  \nSecond, and importantly, HR is simply not a priority for small businesses (Wilkinson 1999: \n209). Given their shortage of resources in terms of time, money, people and expertise, a typical \nSME manager\u2019s organisational imperatives are perceived elsewhere, in finance, production and \nmarketing (McEvoy 1984), with \u2018HR\u2019 of diminished relative significance. Additionally, the \ninfrequency with which critical HR-type decisions are required in firms with a small headcount \u2013 at \nleast, according to the firm\u2019s owner(s) or manager(s) \u2013 can obviate the need for considered attention \nto these matters, further limiting small firms\u2019 exposure to formal HR practices (Nooteboom, 1993) \nand exacerbating the disinclination to invest in HR specialisation (Marlow, 2002). Models depicting \nthe typical life-cycle of small firms (Greiner, 1998; Churchill and Lewis, 1983) note how in the \nstart-up phase, a small headcount allows SME owners and\/or managers to interact with, and \nmonitor, most if not all employees at once and directly, again precluding the \u2018need\u2019 for more \nformalised policies. Management priorities are set as problems arise, and HR policies are adopted ad \nhoc, as required. However, as a business grows, rendering the task of management more complex, \nmany managers acknowledge the need for more formalisation, including for people management \nprocesses (i.e. HRM), in order to meet the demands of a larger workforce and to co-ordinate its \nactivities more effectively. Others, however, continue to resist formalisation.  \nFrom outside the firm, SMEs face greater levels of environmental uncertainty, and so \ninformality, reactivity and short-termism may simply be borne of necessity (de Kok and Uhlaner, \n2001). At the same time, compared with larger firms, SMEs face fewer of the external pressures that \ncan compel managers to manage in certain ways, or to adopt certain HR practices. SMEs tend not to \nbe plugged into either \u201cadvisory\u201d or \u201ccoercive\u201d networks (see Bacon and Hoque, 2005), including \nthe likes of employers\u2019 associations in the former case and trade unions in the latter, and nor is \nemployment legislation applied as stringently to SMEs (Marlow, 2002). However, market pressures \ntend to bear down harder on resource-poor small businesses (Ram and Edwards, 2003). Kinnie et al \n(1999) found an impetus for the formalisation of HRM stemming from the demands of SMEs\u2019 major \ncustomers for \u2018good\u2019 suppliers (i.e. reliable and well-managed). Customers either directly checked \nfor the presence of certain HR practices, or satisfying their service demands indirectly necessitated \nchanges in, for example, training and job design. This echoes Rainnie\u2019s (1989) earlier research on \nthe effect on small firms\u2019 employment systems of the firm\u2019s status in their supply chain. Finally, \nAndrews and Welbourne (2000) found that even if SME managers and entrepreneurs want to make \nHR a priority, they \u201cface pressures to de-emphasise their investments in people\u201d. At the time of the \ninitial public offering of shares firms were \u201cpenalised by the investment community for making a \npublic statement in the prospectus about how much they value their employees\u201d (ibid: 94), or for \nhaving an HR officer in place (ibid: 98). \n 4\nInterpretations of SMEs\u2019 apparent preference for informal management styles have \nconventionally been divided into two categories: the positive, \u2018small is beautiful\u2019 perspective (which \nstresses how minimal bureaucratic controls give rise to satisfying social relations, challenging work \nand greater flexibility) contrasted with the \u2018bleak house\u2019 scenario (which notes the near-absence of \nprogressive HRM practices, and highlights instead the prevalence of work intensification and poor \nterms and conditions under authoritarian, arbitrary and unconstrained management). These two \npolarised characterisations are now deemed \u201coverly simplistic and inaccurate\u201d (Marlow, 2002: 26), \nin the light of the application to SMEs\u2019 workplace relations of the \u2018emerging negotiated agreements \nthrough mutual adjustment\u2019 thesis discussed above. Moreover, recent research has revealed not only \nhighly heterogenous arrangements, but also rather more formalisation and sophistication than the \n\u2018bleak house\u2019 portrayal depicts (see Dex and Scheibl, 2001; Dundon et al., 2001; Hornsby and \nKuratko, 1990; de Kok and Uhlaner, 2001; Ram, 1999a, 1999b). The nationally representative \nWERS98 data notes that only 8% of UK SMEs are purely informal with no \u2018new management \npractices\u2019, and 28% have more than five (Cully et al., 1999: 272). One study of 560 UK SMEs \nfound that many small business managers were \u201cseeking to introduce more formal procedures \nalongside the informal culture and \u2018organic\u2019 nature of management\u201d (Bacon et al., 1996: 90). \nWhile the factors outlined above suggest reasons why small firms tend not to engage \nsystematically with HR matters, de Kok and Uhlaner (2001: 275) are not alone in interpreting this \napproach as displaying a certain lack of foresight. Such foresight would seem especially pertinent in \nthe so-called \u2018knowledge economy\u2019 featuring firms employing a significant proportion of highly-\nskilled staff (such as e-commerce enterprises). \u2018Information-intensive\u2019 firms might be expected to \nrequire sophisticated HR practices, particularly in the realms of career development and training and \nreward, for their rare and valuable employees. Indeed, using WERS98 data, Bacon and Hoque \n(2005) found the skill-mix of the firm\u2019s employees to be the strongest predictor overall for the \nadoption of more formal HRM practices inside SMEs - more so than ownership status, sector, or \nreliance on large customers.  \nTwo studies inside information-intensive sectors shed light on the nature of HRM in firms \ncomparable to our sample in terms of market pressures and workforce profile. Ram\u2019s (1999a; \n1999b) studies of professional consultancies highlight how intense market pressures, and the value \nattached by skilled knowledge workers to their \u2018autonomy\u2019 on the job, combine to compel \nemployers toward establishing fluid project-based work activities, loose systems of supervision, and \nad hoc management\/ HRM arrangements, including over pay. Yet within this seeming \u2018informality\u2019 \nresiduals of hierarchy and the potential for conflict continue to exist. Ackroyd (1995) reported \nsimilar findings from his study of 16 small UK-based information technology firms (mainly \nsoftware suppliers). These too tended to employ multi-skilled \u2018knowledge workers\u2019 with a high \ncustomer orientation and high adaptability and mobility, working in team-based operating units on a \nproject-by-project basis, in order that they might adjust willingly to frequent changes in operational \nsystems, organisational policies and structures, and even staffing profiles in response to \ndevelopments in products and services. Organisational strategy and design tended to be derived \nfrom project requirements (Ackroyd, 1995: 147), and so the firms favoured \u201corganic structures\u201d and \nan \u201cextreme lack of hierarchy\u201d over more \u2018orthodox\u2019 organisational designs (op cit: 141, 150). \nHowever, while noting the near-absence of formality in most cases \u2013 even to the extent that it was \noften difficult to discern a \u2018managerial\u2019 function - Ackroyd did find some evidence of standardised \nHR practices. Teamworking, high earnings and profit-sharing, in particular, were \u201cvery common\u201d \n(op cit: 147), as well as a general trend of firms\u2019 activities and policies being designed to reflect staff \ncompetencies and interests. Such arrangements, however, tended not to have been derived from any \nstrategic reflection.   \n \n 5\nHR inside \u2018e-commerce firms\u2019.  \nIn the great majority of the books and articles on e-commerce, neither HR nor \u2018employee \nmanagement\u2019 in general is even of peripheral interest (see Chen, 2001; Collins, 2000; Evans and \nWurster 1999a, 1999b; Malone and Laubacher, 1998; Newhauser et al., 2000; Timmers, 1998; \nVenkatraman, 2000). The specific literature emphasises instead technological concerns, marketing \nstrategies, networking and the process of securing financial backing. Indeed, the literature tends \u201cto \nportray organization-building as (at best) irrelevant or (at worst) a source of organisational drag in a \nworld operating at \u2018Internet speed\u2019\u201d (Baron and Hannan, 2002). Wright and Dyer (2001: 24) note, \nhowever, that, while commentary in the business press rarely suggests as much, many failures \namong entrepreneurial e-commerce firms \u201cclearly [come from] the inability to deal with \norganizational and people challenges \u2013 rather than lack of vision, great technology or even business \nsavvy\u201d.  \nEvidence of the marginalisation of HR issues comes from two recent studies. Feindt et al \n(2001) acknowledged \u201cattention to good employee relations\u201d as one of \u201csix common factors \nassociated with successful growth companies\u201d (ibid: 53), but then declined to investigate this \nvariable further in their research. They offered no explanation for its omission, almost as though it \nwere self-explanatory? Similarly, Finkelstein (2001) called for research into the \u201cmistakes\u201d made by \nfailed e-commerce start-ups along four dimensions of business strategy - customers, capabilities, \ncompetitive advantage and internal consistency. Though each has clear implications for managing \nemployees, he neglected the lessons that might be learned from examining firms\u2019 \u201cmistakes\u201d in HR \nand organisational design.  \nThe \u2018small is beautiful\u2019 and \u2018bleak house\u2019 caricatures both surface in this literature. Around \nthe time of the e-commerce boom, the stand-alone operations in particular were felt to embody the \n\u2018small is beautiful\u2019 ideal of dynamic, creative, free-form styles of collegial working. By contrast, \nFrank (2001) dissects the exuberant accounts of \u2018dotcom\u2019 firms\u2019 supposedly revolutionary new \u2018e-\nmanagement\u2019 approach, noting the \u2018bleak house\u2019 lack of employee benefits, the chronic culture of \noverwork and the hostility toward employees joining a trade union (Ross, 2000).  \nAmong the few to conduct empirical research into HR-related matters inside e-commerce \nfirms Horner-Long and Schoenberg (2002) compared the value attached to certain leadership \nattributes in a sample split evenly between e-commerce firms and \u2018traditional\u2019 companies. They \nfound commonalities, but the \u2018e-leaders\u2019 valued risk-taking, networking, project management and \ntechnical knowledge more than their traditional counterparts, and seemed less concerned with \nhonesty and collaboration (ibid: 616) - a curious finding, perhaps, for a sector popularly assumed to \nbe reliant upon close working relationships. The authors speculated whether these differences might \nbe related to leadership priorities at different stages of a firm\u2019s life-cycle (ibid: 618).  \nThe Stanford Project on Emerging Companies (SPEC) has tracked the evolution of \norganisational designs, business strategies and employment practices in about 200 \u2018high-technology \nstart-ups\u2019 in Silicon Valley over several years.iv The resulting model (Baron and Hannan, 2002) \nposits five HR strategies: \u2018engineering\u2019, \u2018star\u2019, \u2018commitment\u2019, \u2018bureaucracy\u2019 and \u2018autocracy\u2019, plus \n\u2018aberrant\u2019 to describe hybrid forms. Categorisation is based on three factors: employees\u2019 primary \nattachment (whether to love, work, or money), management\u2019s main co-ordination method (whether \nthrough peer pressure, rules and procedures, or supervision) and the key selection criteria (whether \nskills for tasks, for long-term potential, or for cultural fit). Of interest for this study is that SPEC \nconsidered the \u2018engineering\u2019 model to be the default option for start-ups: employees\u2019 attachment to \nchallenging work, peer group control, and skill-based selection.  \nKanter (2001) drew on findings from her \u2018Global E-Culture Survey\u2019 of self-selecting \nrespondents from 785 organizations, plus 300 interviews inside 80 firms and 24 in-depth case \nstudies to identify four key strategic and organizational implications of e-commerce: treating \n 6\nstrategy formulation as \u201cimprovisational theater\u201d (in essence, encouraging innovation), nurturing \nnetworks of partners, turning organizations into \u2018communities\u2019 and creating a culture that attracts \nand retains the best talent. The latter two have clear implications for HR, principally through \nfostering employees\u2019 commitment to the firm. The more successful \u2018pacesetter\u2019 e-commerce firms \nare more collaborative than the \u2018laggards\u2019, and are professionally run like an \u201cintegrated \ncommunity\u201d (Kanter, 2001: 67-68), including giving employees challenging responsibilities and \nfacilitating their discretion and creativity, delegating decision-making powers based on superior \nknowledge rather than rank, developing inter-departmental collaboration and cohesive and warm \nworking relations, and addressing issues of work-life balance.  \nWright and Dyer (2001) interviewed managers from both the line and HR inside seven e-\ncommerce firms about their \u2018people issues\u2019. Their resulting model for \u2018e-commerce HR\u2019 is based on \nsix broad objectives: attaining employee autonomy with accountability; forging common purpose; \nachieving contextual clarity; promoting personal growth; developing mutual support, and providing \ncommensurate returns to employees. This \u2018architecture\u2019 is designed to attract, develop, retain and \nreward \u201cproactive, adaptive and generative\u201d employees who work in project teams and engage in \ncontinuous learning and innovation in order to realise the firm\u2019s three strategic objectives: sensing \nthe market, mobilising a rapid response and embedding organisational learning. The policies they \nrecommend include a clear corporate vision, continuous information sharing, attitude surveys, \nsupporting employee (self-) development, establishing ad hoc project teams, fair process in \nemployee relations matters, a healthy work-life balance, managing employment security \nexpectations and layoffs sensitively, flexible benefits and, finally, broad-banding and use of \nperformance bonuses in reward schemes.  \nWhat is interesting about these three prescriptions for \u2018e-commerce HRM\u2019 is how closely the \nlists resemble many of the \u2018best practice bundles\u2019 that are often recommended to all companies, \nregardless of sector.v In the manner of HRM prescriptions, then, there seems little differentiation \nbetween the e-commerce sector from others. Only \u2018work-life balance\u2019 seems to attract greater \nattention in the HR checklists for e-commerce firms. \nIn sum, then, prioritised attention to HR matters in any formalised sense is a rarity among \nSMEs and entrepreneurial ventures in general, and among e-commerce firms. For the latter literature \nto pay people management little heed is odd however, given the sector\u2019s reliance on attracting, \nretaining and motivating highly-skilled employees, and HRM\u2019s potential value in this regard. We set \nout in our research to address this gap in the literature.  \n \nMethodology.  \nAcknowledging the dearth of previous studies in this sector, and following Bacon et al\u2019s \n(1996) study of UK SMEs, we sought insights from both a quantitative survey and qualitative case \nstudies from within the sample. 225 UK-owned and UK-based e-commerce companies, identified \nrandomly from specialist and general business magazines, and on-line databases, were contacted by \ntelephone and by letter between March 2001 and July 2001, and the manager responsible for HR\/ \npersonnel issues was invited to complete a questionnaire and take part in follow-up interviews. The \nquestionnaire comprised sections asking for personal information about the respondent and general \ncharacteristics of the firm and the workplace. It then continued with questions \u2013 derived from the \nwording in the \u2018WERS98\u2019 survey source books (Cully et al., 1998; 1999) - about the use made of a \ngroup of standard HR policies and practices (including employee involvement in decision-making, \ninternal communication, financial participation and reward, performance appraisal, training and \nprovisions for employment security). The unit of analysis was at the level of the firm. \n37 companies submitted useable responses (a response rate of 17%).vi For this paper we \nconcentrate only on those firms defined as SMEs (n=30; response rate: 13%). This comparatively \n 7\nlow response rate is common for research into SMEs (see Koch and McGrath, 1996; Daniels et al., \n2002; de Kok and Uhlaner, 2001), and is rather good for a sector that tends to dismiss almost all \ninvitations to participate in research. Nevertheless, the low response rate, the small final sample, and \nthe fact that our respondents were self-selecting, and predominantly drawn from management grades \n(non-response bias and social desirability bias respectively), mean that care should be taken when \ninterpreting the results. We make no claims for our data set to be representative of UK e-commerce \nfirms.  \nTable 1: Sample characteristics of sample of 30 UK e-commerce firms. \n Percentage Frequency \nSize:   \n0-9 employees 37 11 \n10-49 employees 30 9 \n50-250 employees 33 10 \n   \nAge:   \nLess than two years old 33 10 \n2-4 years old 40 12 \nMore than 4 years old 27 8 \n   \nE-commerce sector:    \nBusiness-to-business (B2B) 67 20 \nBusiness-to-consumer (B2C) 40 12 \nNew technology suppliers 13 4 \nOther 7 2 \n   \nAffiliation to, or ownership by, another organisation:   \nYes (i.e. a \u2018small multiple\u2019) 17 5 \nNo (i.e. a stand-alone independent enterprise) 83 25 \n \nMore than four-fifths were stand-alone operations, the remainder being \u2018small multiples\u2019 (i.e \npart of larger enterprises), and most were very small: two-thirds employed fewer than 50. Twelve \nfirms conformed to the WERS98 survey definition of a \u2018small business\u2019, namely 10-99 employees \n(Cully et al., 1999: 251). The firms were also overwhelmingly young. The mean lifetime was 38 \nmonths.  \nRespondents\u2019 jobs ranged from CEO, founder or partner to senior managers (in, for example, \nHR, Finance, Business Development, \u2018Talent\u2019 and Operations) down to HR officer level. All were \npermanent employees, and almost all had been hired on a full-time basis. Most (n=24) had been \nworking for the firm for less than two years; seven for less than a year.  \n \nHR practices in UK e-commerce firms: results. \nAlthough we conducted multiple statistical analyses, the bulk of the results failed to show \nsignificant differences or correlations between sub-groups and variables. This is likely a \nconsequence of the small sample size. Our findings are therefore exploratory and confined here to \ndescriptive profiles (i.e. frequencies and percentages). Instead we discuss the findings in the light of \nprevious research into SMEs. While methods, definitions and research questions differ, comparisons \ncan nevertheless be made for interest. Table 2 provides an overall summary of selected people \nmanagement practices in our sample, compared \u2013 where figures have been published \u2013 with data \nfrom the nationally representative WERS98 sample of small businesses.  \nTable 2 \u2013 The presence of people management practices in 30 UK e-commerce firms, compared with published WERS98 data for all UK SMEs and all UK \nworkplaces (%) \n \n E-commerce firms \n(N=30) \nAll UK SME businesses: \nWERS98 data (N=250) \nAll UK workplaces: \nWERS98 data \nGeneral    \nPersonnel specialist on site 47 9 30 \nTrade union recognition 0 12  \n(7 if owner present at work) \n45 \n    \nConsultation and communication: principles    \nEmployees are encouraged to provide feedback on the company\u2019s performance and \ndecisions \n90 - - \nFuture business plans and changes are communicated to all employees 90 - - \nDecisions affecting employees are taken in consultation with these employees 69 - - \nSenior managers are best placed to make decisions about the workplace 57 74 - \n    \nConsultation and communication: practices    \nJoint consultative committee 33 17 \n(9% with working owner) \n28 \nDedicated problem-solving groups (i.e. quality circles, etc)  30 23 \n(17% with working owner) \n42 \nInformal consultation as and when required  77 - - \nStaff attitude survey in the last five years  7 - 45 \nSuggestion scheme 7 30 (workplaces) 33 \nRegular meetings with the whole workforce present 63 44 48 \nRegular team or departmental briefings  47 \n(71% weekly) \n 57 \n(31% weekly) \nInternal newsletter\/ bulletins (incl. email; Intranet) 47 17 (>25 staff) \n9 (<25 staff)  \n50 \nTransmission down the management chain 30 32 \n(>25 staff: 42) \n60 \nNoticeboards 13   \n    \nFinancial participation and reward    \nShare options for non-managerial grades 63 1 25 (private-sector \nworkplaces) \nShare options for managerial grades 70 - - \n \nContinued overleaf\u2026 \n 8\n 9\nTable 2 continued \u2013 The presence of people management practices in 30 UK e-commerce firms, compared with published WERS98 data for all UK SMEs \nand all UK workplaces (%) \n \nProfit-related bonus\/ profit-sharing scheme for non-managerial grades 53 20 \n(58% for small multiples) \n47 (private-sector \nworkplaces) \nProfit-related bonus\/ profit-sharing scheme for managerial grades 66 - - \nIndividual performance-related pay for non-managerial grades 40 13 * \n(29% for small multiples) \n11 \nIndividual performance-related pay for managerial grades 37 - - \nGroup-based performance-related pay for non-managerial grades 23 13 * \n(29% for small multiples) \n- \nGroup-based performance-related pay for managerial grades 33 - - \n    \nFormal performance appraisal for non-managerial grades 57 32 56 \nFormal employment security\/ redundancies policy 10 - 14 \nMost employees receive five days\u2019 training a year  50 17 - \n \nNotes:   Five point scales (ranging from \u2018strongly agree\u2019 to \u2018strongly disagree\u2019) were used for all items covered in the column referring to our sample, except \nthe section on consultation and communication practices. The Likert-scale items were then re-coded where \u2018strongly agree\u2019 and \u2018agree\u2019 indicated a \u2018Yes\u2019, and all other \nresponses indicated a \u2018No\u2019 (i.e. recoding \u20181\u2019 for the former, and \u20180\u2019 for the latter). While we acknowledge that for some of the questions a dichotomous \u2018yes\/no\u2019 scale \nmight have been more appropriate, we retained the Likert-scale format for uniformity, and we do not believe that the findings would have been significantly different \nas a consequence. For the section on consultation and communication practices the respondent was asked to tick the practices used by the firm. \u2018Yes\u2019 and \u2018No\u2019 were \nused for all items in the WERS98 data. The WERS98 data for SMEs refers to small businesses (i.e. independent stand-alone ventures) only, except where stated.  \n \nAll of the WERS98 data come from two published sources (Cully et al., 1998; 1999) and not from the original dataset. Some data is not reported in these two sources, \nhence the gaps in the comparative analysis.   \n \n* WERS98 data appears to make no distinction between the two schemes.  \nPersonnel specialist on-site. \nIn the light of our literature review, we did not expect to find many Personnel\/HR \nspecialists in our sample. Instead, almost half (n=14) claimed to employ, in the words of the item, \n\u201ca Personnel specialist who is specifically responsible for employment relations issues\u201d. This \nproportion is almost five times that found nationally among small firms, 91% of whom do not \nhave a Personnel specialist (Cully et al., 1999: 257), and is even considerably more than the \nfigure for all UK workplaces.  \n \nTrade union presence. \nNor did we expect to find a trade union presence in our sample. Indeed, none of the 30 \nfirms recognised a trade union, and none felt that their business could \u201cbenefit from recognising a \ntrade union\u201d, although eight expressed a certain ambivalence (ticking \u201cneither agree nor \ndisagree\u201d). WERS98 found unions recognised by 7% of small businesses with a working owner, \nand 25% of small multiples (Cully et al., 1999: 265). \n \nConsultation and communication with employees.  \nIndications from Table 2 are that the principle of consulting and communicating with \nstaff about important business matters is one with which all but a few e-commerce companies are \ncomfortable, although the responses to the statement that \u201csenior managers are best placed to \nmake decisions about the workplace\u201d nevertheless suggest that decision-making probably \nremains \u2018top-down\u2019 in most cases, and employee input might be rather modest. This is a common \nattitude found in small businesses, of course (Wilkinson, 1999), although our sample seems more \ninclined toward inclusive consultation and decision-making than SME counterparts in other \nsectors (Cully et al., 1999: 257).  \nIn terms of practices, \u201cinformal consultation\u201d on an ad hoc basis - unstructured and \nseemingly unclassifiable \u2013 proved, as expected, by far the most popular way of receiving input \nfrom employees.vii However, a third claimed to operate \u201cformal joint consultative committees to \nshare information with employees and involve them in the decision-making processes\u201d. This \nfinding is surprising for a sector popularised as anti-bureaucracy and anti-formality. Moreover, it \nis almost twice the national average for small businesses, which falls to 9% where the owner is \npresent, the likely circumstances for our sample (Cully et al., 1999: 267). However, it is possible \nthat this \u2018industrial relations\u2019 term lost something in translation, and so some error in \ninterpretation, including perhaps some duplication with the other more informal mechanisms, \nmight be occurring. Our sample also made more use of dedicated problem-solving groups than \nsmall businesses nationally, particularly where the owner is present in the workplace (Cully et \nal., 1999: 262).  \nEach firm reported using at least one of five communication methods, in noteworthy \ncontrast with the 13% of all small workplaces, and 22% of all small businesses, with no \ncommunication systems whatsoever (Cully et al., 1999: 261). Our findings echo those of Bacon \nand colleagues (1996: 90) who reported a marked preference among SMEs for direct forms of \ncommunication. The most frequently reported form, the \u201cregular meeting with the whole \nworkforce present\u201d, proved far more popular than among small businesses generally (Cully et al., \n1999: 262). Almost half our sample held regular team briefings or departmental meetings, 71% \non a weekly basis, 14% \u2018as and when required\u2019. The e-commerce firms\u2019 modest reliance upon \n\u201ctransmission of information via the management chain\u201d seems unusually low, although it is in \nline with most small businesses. This finding may be an indication of the lack of clear \nmanagement structures found by Ackroyd (1995).  \n 10\n \nFinancial participation.  \nInnovation with regard to giving employees a financial stake in the business is perhaps the \npolicy most associated with e-commerce firms. Our findings confirm this impression. Use of all \nfour schemes (individualised and group-based performance-related pay, profit-sharing and \nbonuses, and share ownership) proved far more common in our sample than the comparable \nWERS98 findings (Cully et al., 1998; 10; Cully et al., 1999: 261). The exceptional finding is that \n19 firms (63%) offered share options to staff below management grades; 70% also offered them \nto managers. If our sample is representative then the extent of non-managerial share ownership in \ne-commerce firms is outpacing the national trend in all private sector workplaces by a factor of \n2.5. But the starkest comparison is with small businesses, among which a negligible percentage \n(1%) offers share options to staff (Cully et al., 1999: 261). This particular finding is all the more \nsurprising given that, although Welbourne and Andrews (2000: 912) found ESOPs to be vital to \nfirms\u2019 post-IPO survival, despite widespread investor scepticism, we undertook our survey a year \non from the NASDAQ crash in April 2000.  \nRemarkably, four firms applied all four schemes to their non-managerial employees at the \nsame time (see the case studies below). A fifth did not use any, in contrast with 43% of small \nbusinesses reporting none of the schemes (Cully et al., 1999: 261).  \nViewed together, these findings paint a striking picture of extensive financial participation \namong e-commerce firms. Other research provides supporting evidence for this pattern. Three-\nquarters of Arthur Andersen\u2019s sample (2001) operated a share option scheme \u201cfor at least some\u201d \nof their employees, targeted mostly at senior managers. IRS (2001) surveyed 35 e-commerce \nfirms and found that 66% offered share incentives to at least some staff, all but three offering \nthem to all staff. The practice was more popular among stand-alone firms (73% of a sub-sample \nof 22) than among online divisions of traditional firms (54% of a sub-sample of 13). In addition, \n69% applied individual merit pay to senior managers, 63% to IT and technical staff, and 57% to \nmarketing, sales and admin employees. Just two of the IRS 35 used team- or group-based PRP. \n \nPerformance appraisal. \nFormal appraisals for non-managerial employees also appeared strikingly common, given \nthe procedure\u2019s somewhat bureaucratic reputation. WERS98 found that 32% of small workplaces \nconducted a formal performance appraisal for at least 60% of non-managerial employees - 66% \namong small multiples (Cully et al., 1999: 263) \u2013 but 63% of small businesses had no appraisal \nsystems at all. Just over half of our sample (55%) also claimed to sit down with employees to \ndiscuss career and promotion opportunities.  \n \nTraining.  \nThe stereotypical view of SMEs\u2019 approach to staff training is that it is under-valued and \nneglected (often due to financial constraints), but if it is done, it is done so \u2018informally\u2019, on-the-\njob in an ad hoc manner on a case-by-case basis (CBI, 2003: 1). However, given high-tech firms\u2019 \nneed to develop and retain skilled employees we expected greater attention to staff training than \nwould be evident among small firms in other sectors. WERS98 defined training specifically as \nhaving been paid for by the employer and located away from the normal place of work, a \ndistinction we did not incorporate into our question, and so any comparison must be cautiously \nundertaken. Half our sample claimed that \u201cmost employees receive a minimum of five days\u2019 \ntraining per year\u201d, in contrast to 12% of all UK workplaces (Cully et al., 1998: 10), and the 17% \nof small businesses who provided some training to most staff (Cully et al., 1999: 259).  \n 11\n  \n Job security\/ redundancy management. \nGiven the \u2018dotcom crash\u2019 of 2000, and the ongoing struggle to turn a profit for most e-\ncommerce firms (Saunders and Cook, 2002), we were not expecting one year on to find many \nwritten policies on job\/ employment security, or redundancy management. Surprisingly, however, \nthree firms had adopted a formal policy (see the case studies for details of one policy). This \nproportion of our sample compares well with the 14% of all UK workplaces having such a policy \n(Cully et al., 1998: 10); we found no figure reported for SMEs.  \n \nFive case studies. \nThe survey findings indicated, somewhat surprisingly, that our sample of e-commerce firms \nhad embraced many HR practices in a formal and even professional manner. Moreover, in many \npolicy domains, they seemed to have done so to an extent far in excess of the national profile for \nsmall businesses. This was even more striking given that 37% were micro-businesses (less than \n10 employees), and may have been too small to even need any formalised HR practices (see \nHornsby and Kuratko, 1990: 11). We were interested to investigate further the issues signalled by \nour survey results, on the nature of our sample\u2019s engagement with HRM and employee \nmanagement in general.  \nThe letter attached to the survey asked if respondents would agree to take part in follow-up \ninterviews. Of the thirteen who agreed, we ultimately secured access to five. The firms (all made \nanonymous) and the interviewee were: \n\u2022 One of the co-founders of \u2018skiing-trips.com\u2019 (a \u2018B2C\u2019 holiday firm) \n\u2022 The CEO and founder of \u2018DIY-centre.com\u2019 (a \u2018B2C\u2019 customer-supplier agency) \n\u2022 The manager responsible for HR matters at \u2018most-sports.com\u2019 (a sports website) \n\u2022 One of the co-founders of \u2018web-voicing.com\u2019 (a new technology supplier)  \n\u2022 The manager responsible for HR matters at \u2018build-sites.com\u2019 (a website host and \ndesigner).  \n \nAll five firms were founded in the late 1990s, around the height of the \u2018dotcom\u2019 frenzy, and \nall five are still trading in one form or another in 2005.  \nOne semi-structured interview took place between July and August 2001, and lasted between \n90 and 120 minutes in length. We sought insights into the firm\u2019s approach to people management \nand HRM from the formation of the company onwards. We asked the interviewee how the firm \nhad made its decisions on HR over the life-cycle of the firm, noting when each began to \nformulate an HR strategy, and first appointed an HR professional. We then collated descriptions \nof the firm\u2019s current HR function, structures and practices in the realms covered by our survey. \nAdditional documentary evidence came from the firm\u2019s responses to our survey, plus company \npolicies, annual reports, case studies, press releases, and media reports.  \nDue to space restrictions we present here brief narratives summarising each of these central \nthemes across the five firms. Throughout we discuss the case studies\u2019 findings in the light of the \nliterature review presented above.  \n \nThe start-up phase. \nFrom the outset, most of the entrepreneur owners wanted to start an e-commerce venture \n\u201cto make money, and fast\u201d (skiing-trips.com); \u201cto have fun, make loads of money and learn as \nmuch as possible\u201d (DIY-centre.com). Most wanted to operate as stand-alone ventures if possible, \nand all were very keen to differentiate themselves from the much-derided \u2018traditional\u2019 \n 12\norganisational philosophies, strictures and limitations found in \u2018old\u2019, \u2018bricks-and-mortar\u2019 \ncompanies.  \nIn the initial start-up phase, none of the founders gave much thought to questions of \norganisational structure, and still less to people management\/ HRM. Other functions\u2019 agendas \ndominated and HR was simply not judged important enough to warrant considered attention. One \npossible explanatory factor is that many were buoyed by ample \u2018incubator\u2019 funding and venture \ncapital support (to the tune of millions) \u2013 in contrast to SME counterparts in other sectors lacking \nthe security of such resources.  \nIn common with many small firms, the initial recruits came from the co-founders\u2019 \nnetwork of immediate friends. Yet, in contrast to the SPEC project\u2019s anticipated \u2018default\u2019 \nselection policy for high-tech firms being based on specific skills, none of the five used \ncompetencies as essential criteria. Instead, one firm owner cited \u201c\u2018culture\u2019 compatibility and \nfriendship\u201d, and conceded that hiring mates had not proved an effective strategy for the long run.  \nSkiing-trips.com\u2019s early experiences seem typical. The firm\u2019s early days were recalled as \n\u201cone continuous party: everyone was only doing what they liked doing and were there for fun\u201d. \nThe firm had no formal business strategy or even an idea for a workable corporate structure. \nNobody was reporting to anybody. There were \u201cno rules, no procedure, it was a free \nenvironment\u201d. All business decisions, including HRM policy areas, were taken on a day-to-day \nbasis, with an informal consensus among staff sought as far as possible. As the co-founder put it: \n\u201cWe had equalised \u2018flat, fast decision-making\u2019 and \u2018flexible\u2019 business with being \u2018unstructured\u2019\u201d. \nThe co-founders at DIY-centre.com had also sought to keep all business processes as \u201cfluid and \nadaptable\u201d as possible. Although they were aware that they needed an HR strategy during the \nstart-up phase, \u201cthere was no time to sit down and create one. We couldn\u2019t anticipate our HR \nneeds in the future, so we didn\u2019t come up with a strategy\u201d.  \nFor two firms (web-voicing.com and skiing-trips.com), the impetus for introducing some \nsemblance of strategy and structure came from concerned external stakeholders, particularly their \nventure capitalist backers. With business growth and an expanded workforce, their \u2018anarchic\u2019, \nconsensual style of decision-making had become fraught and ineffective. By contrast, we found \ninternal catalysts for greater formalisation within the family firm build-sites.com, following the \nappointment of an external CEO, and at most-sports.com when a disastrous round of compulsory \nredundancies led to it paying greater attention to people management. The firm had secured \nmassive financial backing upon launch and early in its life won a lucrative exclusive contract. In \nthe exhilaration, it hired 60 extra staff on very attractive salaries. But after the contract expired, \nthe firm struggled to sustain its impact, and was forced to make half of these recruits \ncompulsorily redundant just months later. With no formal proccesses in place, it handled the \nprocess very badly by its own admission, and the crisis stung the surviving workforce.  \n \nThe arrival of \u2018HR\u2019. \nDuring the first two years of business none of the firms had an HR strategy, or at least not \none that had been formalised or expressly articulated. At a certain growth stage however the \nappeal of the \u2018free-style\u2019 approach to decision-making, including for employee management, was \noffset by its disadvantages and more formal structures became attractive.  \nOnce skiing-trips.com had been compelled by its backers to modify its original business \nstrategy, \u201cfrom \u2018want to make it fast to cash in our stock options\u2019\u2026 to building a brand and\u2026 \nwanting to be the best in every aspect of the business\u201d, the firm started thinking for the first time \nabout HR matters. This came one year on from inception. Eventually they deployed a \u2018Star\u2019 \nstrategy (cf. Baron and Hannan, 2002) - employing people based on their talent and potential, \n 13\nthen creating a working environment in which they were set challenging tasks tied to very \nattractive reward packages - and they implemented several HR practices to complement the new \ndirection. Most-sports.com hired its first Personnel\/HR specialist two years after inception, \nfollowing its painful redundancies crisis. DIY-centre.com also first hired a specialist two years \nafter being formed. The family owners of build-sites.com took three years to hire theirs \n(alongside the external CEO). Interestingly they selected a mature HR professional with \nexperience in blue-chip companies rather than a young generalist novice. She described arriving \nto \u201can open show\u2026 there was no HR policy at all\u201d, nor any vision or strategy for where the firm \nwas going. At the time of the interview web-voicing.com had no HR specialist on its 24-strong \npayroll. \n \nThe status of the HR function.  \nNone of the four HR specialists enjoyed \u2018strategic partner\u2019 status (cf. Ulrich\u2019s four HR \nroles: 1997); all fulfilled primarily administrative roles, professionalising HR policy areas. \nFormulation of HR strategy and the management of organisational change remained \nresponsibilities for the senior managers. However, the HR manager at build-sites.com is called \ninfrequently by the Board to attend strategic meetings, mainly when \u2018people\u2019 issues arise, and \nmost-sports.com\u2019s HR manager \u2013 interviewed as the company was folding to be sold for a \nnominal sum - reported having \u201cthe freedom to implement HR policy as long as it doesn\u2019t cost \nanything\u201d.  \n \nHR policy and practice. \nAll five firms tended to conduct consultation with staff and organisational decision-\nmaking on an informal and irregular basis, as and when required. Most arrangements appeared to \nbe management-dominated, with only modest scope for employees to voice their opinions and \noffer feedback. All five ran team briefings (typically weekly, or ad hoc) and general meetings \nwith the whole workforce present. Widespread use was made of newsletters and email bulletins \nand office noticeboards. No formal arrangements (i.e. a joint consultative committee) were in \nevidence. Decision-making at skiing-trips.com, for example, bore close resemblance to a \n\u2018traditional\u2019 company, having mutated from the \u2018all-inclusive\u2019 near-anarchy of before toward \n\u2018top-down\u2019 imposition of senior managers\u2019 judgement. However, the perceived flexibility and \ncreativity from occasional ad hoc all-workforce exchanges remained valued. They also conducted \nstaff surveys, and operated a staff suggestion scheme. DIY-centre.com had found a way of \nstructuring its decision-making in a manner resembling joint problem-solving\/ working parties. \nThey used a system of  \u2018frequent workshops\u2019, arranged informally whenever needed, and \ncharacterised by the founder as collective \u2018brainstorming\u2019. These arrangements have been used \nfor almost all major business decisions, including the company\u2019s re-structuring. The Board at \nweb-voicing.com often invited an employee delegate to take part in discussions for major \nstrategic decisions. Most-sports.com made use of dedicated problem-solving groups.  \nEach of the five firms demonstrated the innovations in financial participation highlighted \nin our survey. Build-sites.com and web-voicing.com ran all four schemes for all staff grades. \nWhile the latter had implemented appraisals to inform its pay awards, the former was finalising \nits policy at the time of the interview. All of skiing-trips.com\u2019s senior managers held share \noptions, only some non-managerial staff had been offered them. All staff received a company-\nwide profit-sharing bonus, and all were subject to individual performance-related pay. DIY-\ncentre.com used group-based performance-related pay, a profit-sharing bonus and share \nownership, while most-sports.com reported using profit-sharing, share ownership, and \n 14\nindividualised performance-related pay for all staff grades. The latter was considered the \u201cbest\u201d \nsystem for rewarding staff, the share options \u201cuseless\u201d because the share price had plummeted. \nThe interviewees revealed that they offered share options \u201cbecause everyone else did\u201d, implying \nthat they were seen more as a recruitment pre-requisite to off-set the attractions of rival firms \nthan either a motivational tool or part of a performance management strategy, the two rationales \nidentified by Lawler (2001). In other words, their popularity may be less an indicator of strategic \ninnovation in HRM, and more a pragmatic response to the going rewards package in the sector at \nthe time.  \nFinally, web-voicing.com was one of the three firms in our sample to have a written \npolicy on employment security and redundancies (another was skiing-trips.com). Expectations \nwere set out in transparent fashion at the recruitment stage that bonuses may be frozen, and even \nacross-the-board cuts in pay implemented. Build-sites.com\u2019s policy was a work in progress at the \ntime of the interview. Most-sports.com had offered employability training, and consulted with \nstaff earlier, in its later redundancy rounds.   \nIn sum, then, the case studies illustrate the curious mix between noteworthy innovations \nin HRM and a dependence upon enduring, \u2018traditional\u2019 methods for managing employees that \nhad been suggested in our survey findings. We discuss the broader implications in the conclusion. \n \nLimitations. \nIn addition to those pertaining to the sample profile (see Methodology), we would also \nhighlight the occasional confusion encountered by respondents over what some items meant, \nevidenced by some recourse to the \u2018neither agree nor disagree\u2019 option. This may indicate that \n\u2018industrial relations\u2019 terms such as joint consultative committee, and even employment security, \nare not easily interpreted in an e-commerce context, even by HR professionals. An alternative \nexplanation is that some HR policies are implemented in only a partial manner that falls short, in \nthe respondent\u2019s view, of being a verifiable practice covering the whole firm (e.g. financial \nparticipation schemes offered to selected employees only).  \nWe also readily acknowledge that we did not capture in our limited survey several \npotential explanatory control variables, including the owners\u2019 prior business experience; her\/his \nexposure to, and knowledge of, HRM; the workforce\u2019s skills profile, and different funding \narrangements and ownership structures.viii \nFinally, this study applies only to SME-sized e-commerce firms, and primarily to those \nthat are independent enterprises. Traditional \u2018bricks and mortar\u2019 companies moving into e-\ncommerce face very different HR challenges - not least of which is operating simultaneously two \nmanagement regimes (one for the \u2018old\u2019 firm; one for the \u2018new\u2019 e-division) - and face very \ndifferent HR challenges as a consequence (see Kanter, 2001; Wright and Dyer, 2001). \n \nConclusions. \nTo reiterate, this study is exploratory in nature. Its value lies in its novelty (certainly for \nthe UK) and the scarcity of similar studies, and \u2013 if such firms are still being formed \u2013 for the \nresearch agendas and future hypotheses that the results and analysis suggest. \nWe offer the following conclusions. First, the reported incidence of several standard HR \npractices operating firm-wide suggests that the extent of formalised people management \nprocesses in e-commerce firms may be far greater than the literatures on SMEs, entrepreneurs \nand e-commerce itself would have us expect. In particular, the high number of Personnel\/HR \nspecialists in our sample challenges Whiteley\u2019s (2002) assertion that HR departments \u201chave not \nbeen popular\u201d in e-commerce firms. The findings challenge the dominant impression of small \n 15\nfirms\u2019 preference for an \u2018unprofessional\u2019 approach to employee management matters, and echo \nthe more sophisticated impression gleaned from the Bacon et al study (1996). They may even \noffer some support for the positive stereotype of e-commerce firms being more \u2018people-oriented\u2019 \nthan their counterparts in other sectors. However, since we have no data on the employees\u2019 \nperceptions and experiences inside these firms, as recommended for SME research by Barrett and \nRainnie (2002), we cannot issue a confident endorsement of the so-called \u2018e-commerce\u2019 \napproach.  \nDespite the apparently widespread use of many HR practices, we found little evidence \nfrom the case studies to suggest that e-commerce firms engage with people management or HRM \nin a way that could be described convincingly as \u2018strategic\u2019. This determinedly \u2018free-form\u2019 \napproach to strategy formulation, including that for HRM, is enthusiastically endorsed in the e-\ncommerce literature (e.g. Venkatraman\u2019s call (2000) for a continuous cycle of \u201cselective \nexperimentation\u201d). Yet, as our literature review demonstrates, far from being a radical new \napproach this has long been a common trait among small start-ups (see too Marlow and Patton, \n1993; Perry, 2001; O\u2019Regan and Ghobadian, 2002). That organisational founding is \u201ca disorderly \nprocess in which people improvise as best they can, given their situation\u201d (Katz et al., 2000: 9) \nwas as true for firms in the \u2018old\u2019 economy as it is for the heroic young innovators in the \u2018new\u2019. \nWe discerned a distinct incremental time-line of phased progress (or decline?) toward \nformalisation in e-commerce firms\u2019 dealing with HRM, which questions Whiteley\u2019s observation \n(2002) of there being \u201cno consistent pattern in terms of development of people and integration of \npeople management to the business in newer start-ups\u201d. Each of the five case study firms began \nwith a \u2018honeymoon\u2019 phase, marked by the owners\u2019 \u2018default\u2019 preference for loosely structured, \nreactive, short-termist, informal \u201cfraternalism\u201d. This phase of haphazard \u2018muddling through\u2019, \npunctuated on occasion by ad hoc policy creation as needs arose, typically lasted around a year \nuntil each firm faced an internal or external \u2018shock\u2019 of some kind (pressure from backers or an \norganisational trauma, for example). This served as an impetus toward more formalised \nprofessionalisation, even - dare we say \u2013 toward more \u2018bureaucratic\u2019 arrangements, in many cases \nleading to the appointment of the firm\u2019s first HR specialist. Indeed, our case study evidence \nechoes Whiteley\u2019s observation (2002) that HR departments \u201chave been introduced only when the \nsize of the organization became such that it was indispensable\u201d. The co-founder at one firm felt \nthat this threshold arrived around the tenth or twelfth recruit, close to the 20 proposed previously \nby Roberts et al (1992: 255). Support for a size-threshold hypothesis is also implied in Matlay\u2019s \nresearch (1999) into the formalisation of HR policy in 6,000 UK businesses, of which 5,969 were \nSMEs.ix Again, however, several long-standing firm-growth models depict similar transformation \nthresholds (Churchill and Lewis, 1983; Greiner, 1998; Hanks et al., 1993; Wynarczk et al., \n1993). \nWhen eventually required to implement a coherent set of HR policies, the firms\u2019 owners \ntended to follow the tried-and-tested approach of nascent entrepreneurs from the \u2018old\u2019 economy \nwho, \u201clacking clairvoyance, mostly reproduce common forms characteristic of the populations \nthey enter, rather than crafting new ones\u201d (Katz et al., 2000: 9). This \u2018mimetic\u2019 process to HR \npolicy selection and implementation (see DiMaggio and Powell, 1991; Paauwe and Boselie, \n2002) - copying others in the same sector - would appear to be borne out by the extraordinary \nprevalence of employee share ownership, adopted because \u201ceveryone else\u201d had it. Recast in this \nlight, e-commerce innovations in HRM appear rather less radical, and instead might even seem \nconformist.  \nThe process of upheaval from original foundations presents e-commerce managers with \nconsiderable problems. The partial surrender to more \u2018traditional\u2019 organisational forms seems to \n 16\nhave occurred often against the will and ideals of company founders. Yet several interviewees \nexpressed regret at not introducing more coherent organisational systems earlier. For DIY-\ncentre.com\u2019s co-founder, it had been, in his words, the firm\u2019s \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d to have delayed \nadapting its informal and all-inclusive decision-making into a more structured format. In their \nresearch among Silicon Valley start-ups Baron and Hannan (2002) also found that the founders\u2019 \noriginal HR blueprint - such as it was \u2013 exerted considerable influence on subsequent progress, \nand that changing strategy almost always proved disruptive.  \nThis is perhaps the central paradox facing e-commerce managers and owners: how to \nkeep sufficient control over organisational decision-making while upholding the dynamism, \ninformality, inclusivity and semi-autonomous working they dearly prize, and which is believed to \nhelp retain and motivate eminently poachable employees. Ram (1999a: 27) has noted the \nimportance to small information-intensive firms of \u201cthe manner in which autonomy is handled\u201d, \nwhile a PwC report (2001) concluded: \u201cWithout careful management of people\u2019s expectations by \nbosses and HR directors, dotcoms risk turning into pale imitations of old economy companies, \nand their staff becoming disillusioned\u201d.  Yet, again, evidence for the same dilemma has been \nfound among small firms in other sectors. Bacon and colleagues (1996: 90) conclude their study \nof 560 UK SMEs by noting how the challenge of introducing change in small firms is \u201cmanaging \nthe introduction of the formalisation necessary to retain management control while not destroying \nthe informality and culture\u201d. Put simply, the delicate balancing act - between founders\u2019 idealistic \naspirations and a cherished \u2018informality\u2019 versus the more pragmatic requirements for running an \neffective business - is hardly the sole province of \u201cradical\u201d e-commerce firms, but a perennial \nissue for small business managers in general. Heneman, Tansky and Camp (2000), among many, \nhave urged further research on HRM development during entrepreneurial firms\u2019 life-cycles.  \nTo conclude, our research has found evidence of information-intensive e-commerce firms \nengaging with HR innovations in line with models for the \u2018new\u2019 economy at the same time as \ndisplaying (often reluctant) continuities with a supposedly discredited past, and with their \nallegedly less dynamic counterparts in other sectors. This has led many authors to criticise the \u2018e-\n\u2019 prefix as \u201cunnecessary, inappropriate and unhelpful. The use of such terms exaggerates the \ncontrast between current business norms as well as simplifying the potential for innovation\u201d \n(Palmer, 2002: 266).

Kanter (2001: 2) reserves the term \u2018dotcom\u2019 for \u201cpure Internet\u201d \ncompanies. \n \nii Among the many such tales, the story of Pixelon surely stands out. The managers at this Californian new \ntechnology supplier spent three-quarters of their entire venture capital funding - $16m - on a single party for the \nworkforce in Las Vegas at which The Who, Kiss and Tony Bennett all gave private concerts (Frank, 2001: 364). \n \niii We draw on a review of the SME literature in order to compare our study with existing findings in comparable \nfirms. However, while de Kok and Uhlaner (2001) found the size of the workforce to be strongest determining \ninfluence on such firms\u2019 HRM, HRM and people management varies significantly even within this category: micro-\nfirms employing less than 10 people have very different arrangements than larger small firms (see Matlay, 1999). \nMoreover, Marlow (2002: 30) has rightly questioned whether size fully captures the profile of such firms. She cites \nmarket performance and market presence as other likely determining factors. However, for comparative purposes \nwith our sample, we rely on the broad SME literature. \n \niv This includes website designers, computer hardware\/ software manufacturing or research firms, but also firms in \nsectors such as biotechnology and telecommunications, and so the sample is not strictly comparable to ours. \n \nv To take just two such lists for illustrative purposes, Pfeffer\u2019s (1998) seven universally applicable best practices are: \nemployment security, selective hiring, self-managing teams, high compensation contingent on organisational \nperformance, extensive training, reduction of status differentials, and sharing information. Wood and de Menezes \n(1998: 491-495) operationalised \u2018high commitment management\u2019 as recruitment based on social skills and team \nworking, use of problem-solving groups, widespread information briefings at several organisational levels, an \nattractive pay and reward scheme (including monthly and cashless pay, merit awards, profit-sharing and employee \nshare options), training needs analysis, appraisal, and various welfare and benefit policies. \n \nvi We secured the 37 with some difficulty. After providing a stamped addressed envelope to encourage a higher \nresponse rate, we followed up each mailing with several reminders by telephone, and later sent an electronic version \nof the questionnaire which could be completed directly on the Internet. 25 companies explicitly declined our \ninvitation, and in an indication of the volatility of the e-commerce sector, 10 companies (almost 5%) had ceased \ntrading when we contacted them just a month after the first approach. \n \nvii If anything, its extent may be even greater, since the responses under \u2018Other\u2019 (5 firms: 17%) also appear to \nencapsulate informal means for gauging what staff think: \u2018daily general conversations\u2019, \u2018regular meetings\u2019 [the \nnature of which was not presumably captured by any of the options available], plus the \u2018intranet\u2019. \n \nviii Hamilton (2001) has hypothesised, without empirical testing, that variation in e-commerce firms\u2019 culture might be \nattributable to the different pressures and priorities imposed by different funding arrangements (e.g. self-funded \noperations having a more family\/gang-like atmosphere than those funded by venture capitalists, and subsidiaries of \nlarger firms being more likely to experience centrally-imposed bureaucratic systems than stand-alone operations). \n \nix Matlay (1999) found \u2018informality\u2019 to be the dominant management style in 91.5% of his sub-sample of 5,383 \nmicro-businesses (1-9 employees); none had fully formal arrangements. 68% of the 457 small businesses (11-49 \nemployees) were also managed informally; just 7.2% had \u2018formalised\u2019. The pattern toward formalisation \naccompanied increases in firm size such that among Matlay\u2019s 129 medium-sized companies (50-250 employees) \n24.7% retained the informal approach, but almost every remaining firm had either \u2018formalised\u2019 or \u2018professionalised\u2019 \ntheir arrangements (22% and 55% respectively). \n"}
