The area has attracted a great deal of attention and a host of innovative approaches  developed.  However,  as\nthe examples highlighted here illustrate, many challenges remain.\nKeywords: Carbon nanotubes; functionalisation; terthiophenes; sulfonation;\npolymer nanocomposites; biocompatibility; conducting polymers.\nBiographical notes: 100 words for each authors. 150-200 for corresponding author\n1              Introduction\n\u201cSingle-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) of molecular perfection\u201d [[i]] aptly describes the hollow  carbon  fibres  first\ndiscovered in their multi-wall form by Iijima in 1991 [[ii]],  and  later  as  single  wall  nanotubes  in  1993  [[iii],[iv]].\nSince then, both types of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been shown  to  exhibit  a  startling  array  of  properties  that\nclearly target these materials for new applications within existing areas of research as well as driving the development\nof exciting new fields of enquiry.\nEssentially one-dimensional, as evidenced  by  well-spaced  symmetric  structures  in  the  local  density  of  states\nknown  as  Van  Hove  singularities,  it  has  been  shown  that  SWNTs  display  either  metallic  or   semi-conducting\nproperties depending on their diameter and helicity [[v],[vi]]. Thermal conductivity  in  CNTs  is  unparalleled  [[vii]],\nand those of the metallic variety exhibit ballistic electron transport capabilities without the dissipation of heat  [[viii]].\nMechanically, they have been shown to be the stiffest known material [[ix]], with the added virtue of behaving  elastic\nunder strain rather than fracturing [[x]].\nEarly research on CNTs primarily focused on determining and exploiting the properties of  the  pristine  materials.\nMore recently, however, exploration into the chemistry of  CNTs,  particularly  their  functionalisation,  has  begun  to\ndominate the field with attempts to produce composite materials with novel properties complementary to those of  the\npristine nanotubes [[xi]].\nThe first attempts at chemical functionalisation of CNTs were in response to their poor  solubility.  Pristine  CNTs\nalign parallel with one another  to  form  ropes  or  bundles  [[xii]],  thus  increasing  van  der  Waals  interactions  and\ndecreasing their free energy, but also preventing the dissolution necessary for much of  the  chemistry  envisioned  for\nthese materials.  Although pristine CNTs have been  shown  to  form  stable  dispersions  with  the  aid  of  surfactants\n[[xiii]],   or   dispersions   with   short-term   stability   in   amides   such   as   N,N-dimethylformamide    (DMF),    N-\nmethylpyrrolidone (NMP), and other non-hydrogen bonding  Lewis  bases  [[xiv]],  better  methods  for  solvation  are\nunder intense investigation [[xv]].\nCNTs  are  expected  to  exhibit  chemical  properties  somewhere  between  that  of  graphite,  a   relatively   inert\ncompound for which only fluorinated and oxidized derivatives  can  be  produced  without  completely  disrupting  the\nlayered structure [[xvi]] and the fullerenes, which have a rich spectrum of chemistry [[xvii]]. The curvature within the\nnanotubes  generates  strain  with  a  concomitant  loss  of  conjugation  from  misalignment  of  the   ?\u2013orbitals,   thus\nincreasing the reactivity of the tubes as a means to relieve stress [[xviii]].  It is  precisely  this  strain  that  renders  the\nstrongly pyramidalised end caps more reactive  than  the  sidewalls  and  explains  their  loss  during  purification  and\nreactive processes [[xix]]. Furthermore, defects in the nanotube  structure,  as  potential  sites  for  increased  chemical\nreactivity, [18] include five-  or  seven-membered  rings  [[xx]]  incorporated  during  synthesis,  as  well  as  carboxyl\nterminated ends where the caps have been removed during purification [[xxi]]. CNTs, therefore,  are  susceptible  to  a\nvariety of functionalisation methods, either mediated by oxidative processes that form reactive groups at the  end-caps\nand defect  sites,  or  through  direct  modification  of  the  sidewalls,  both  covalently  and  non-covalently.  Covalent\nattachment involves direct attachment of the functionality to the CNTs via the formation of chemical  bonds,  whereas\nnon-covalent  attachment  involves   CNT-molecule   interactions   involving   electrostatic,   van   der   Waals   and\/or\nhydrophobic interactions.\nThere is no doubt that covalent attachment has a dramatic effect on the chemical as well as electronic properties of\nCNTs and structures made from them [[xxii]].  Covalent  attachment  to  CNTs  can  be  achieved  using  a  myriad  of\nchemistries as described in a number of recent reviews [11,21,[xxiii],[xxiv],[xxv],[xxvi]]. Both SWNTs and  MWNTs\nhave  been  used  and  a  multitude  of  functional  groups  introduced  using  an  equally  diverse  range   of   chemical\napproaches.\nSince the purification of CNTs is often carried out using oxidative methods that introduce carbonyl and carboxylic\nacid groups on the open ends of the CNTs and at defect sites along the CNT  sidewalls  [[xxvii],[xxviii],[xxix],[xxx]],\nthere are a plethora of  reports  in  which  functionalities  are  introduced  via  carboxylate  derivatives  such  as  esters\n[1,[xxxi]], and amides [[xxxii],[xxxiii],[xxxiv],[xxxv]].   As  a  consequence,  this  has  become  one  of  the  favoured\nroutes of covalently attaching biomolecules to CNTs; the proliferation and ready availability of  amino  functionalities\non proteins, enzymes and antibodies among other biomolecules, allows for facile  amide  functionalisation  with  CNT\ncarboxylates. A wide variety of biomolecules such as  carbohydrates  [[xxxvi]],  oligonucleotides  [[xxxvii]],  proteins\n[[xxxviii],[xxxix]],  enzymes  [[xl],[xli]]  and  even  DNA  [[xlii],[xliii],[xliv]]  have  been  attached  to  CNTs  in  this\nfashion.\nHowever, the extent of functionalisation is dependent on the degree and type of nanotube carboxylation, which  in\nturn varies according  to  the  source  of  CNTs;  such  functionalisation  can  be  difficult  to  reproduce.   In  addition,\nhydrolysis of the amide or ester  bond  under  basic  or  acidic  conditions  causes  the  CNTs  to  de-functionalise  and\nprecipitate out of solution [[xlv]].\nIn contrast, a number of direct sidewall functionalisation  methodologies  have  been  developed,  which  typically\ninvolve a reactive intermediate such  as  a  radical  [[xlvi]],  carbene  [[xlvii]],  or  nitrene  [[xlviii]],  ylide  [[xlix]]  or\ndiazonium salt [[l]].  These  methods  typically  allow  direct  formation  of  stable  carbon-carbon  or  carbon-nitrogen\nbonds. While these methods are typically chemical in nature, analogous electrochemical methods  have  also  received\nmuch  attention.  Thus,  electrochemical  reactions  have  been  used  to  covalently  attach  aryl  groups  to  CNTs  via\nreductive coupling of alkyl diazonium salts [[li]] or oxidative coupling of arylamines [[lii]]. The  conditions  used  are\nrelatively mild and can be  carefully  controlled  using  a  potentiostat  leading  to  less  degradation  of  the  CNTs.  In\naddition, functionalisation is localised on the electrode surface exposed to electrolyte.\nNon covalent attachment has been used effectively to attach a variety of moieties to CNTs.  A  range  of  synthetic\npolymers such as poly(m-phenylenevinylene) [[liii],[liv]] or PVA  [[lv],[lvi]]  have  been  shown  to  effectively  wrap\naround CNTs. The interaction of biomolecules with CNTs has also been of particular interest with a view to their  use\nas bioelectronic sensors [[lvii]] improving biocompatibility [[lviii]] or providing platforms to support growth of  nerve\ncells [[lix]]. Non-covalent binding of streptavidin to CNTs has been achieved via covalent attachment  to  linkers  that\nare  adsorbed  along  the  CNT  axis  [[lx]].  Others  have  shown  that   streptavidin   undergoes   spontaneous   helical\ncrystallisation onto CNT surfaces [[lxi]]. It has also been demonstrated that an IgG antibody can  be  directly  attached\nto fullerenes by non-covalent means [[lxii]].\nOf particular interest with a view to the development of  new  diagnostic  systems  is  the  attachment  of  DNA  or\noligonucleotides to CNTs. DNA has been shown to strongly interact with CNTs, forming uniform coatings [[lxiii]]. In\nfact, the interactions are strong enough to influence the electronic properties of the DNA [[lxiv]].\nDieckmann et al. [[lxv]] used non-specific binding of an ?-helix amphiphilic peptide to assist in  dispersing  CNTs\nin aqueous media. The hydrophobic region of the peptide interacted with the aromatic surface of the  CNT,  while  the\nhydrophilic   face   promoted   self-assembly   through   peptide-peptide   interactions.   Zheng   et   al.   [[lxvi],[lxvii]]\ndemonstrated the ability of sequence dependant single strand  DNA  (ssDNA)  to  separate  smaller  diameter  metallic\nCNTs from larger diameter semi-conducting CNTs.  The  wrapping  of  CNTs  has  recently  been  extended  to  other\nbiopolymers including chitosan and  chondroitin  sulfate  [[lxviii]].  As  for  covalent  attachment  the  introduction  of\nfunctionality to CNTs significantly affects the options available for subsequent processing and the physical as well  as\nchemical\/biological properties of the resulting materials. For example, CNT-biopolymer dispersions  have  been  used\nas a feed to produce lengths of fibres using a wet spinning process [[lxix]].\nThe purpose here is to present selected examples  illustrating  how  covalent  or  non-covalent  attachment  can  be\nachieved. Each example highlights the opportunities and the challenges and indicates how functionalisation  improves\nthe options on processing and \"device\" fabrication.\n2            Experimental\n2.1         Instrumentation\nA bath sonicator (Unisonics Australia, 150 W, 40 kHz) was used for functionalisation of CNTs. A  high  power  sonic\nhorn (Sonics  Vibra-Cell  500W)  was  used  to  prepare  SWNT:  biomolecule  dispersions.  UV-visible  spectra  were\nmeasured using a Shimadzu 1601 UV-visible spectrophotometer and  a  1cm  path  length  cell.  Raman  spectroscopy\nmeasurements were performed using a Jobin Yvon Horiba HR800 Spectrometer  equipped  with  a  He:Ne  laser  (?  =\n632.8 nm) utilizing a 300-line grating. FT-IR spectroscopy was performed on  a  Perkin  Elmer  Paragon  1000  FT-IR\nspectrometer on samples ground with KBr and pressed into disks. High resolution  transmission  electron  microscopy\n(HRTEM) images were obtained using a Philips CM200 HRTEM. Samples for TEM were dispersed in an appropriate\nsolvent and drop cast onto holey carbon girds for analysis.\nElectrical conductivity measurements were made with a Jandel  four  point  probe  resistivity  tester  Model  RM2.\nElectrochemical  characterization  was  performed  on  the  functionalised  SWNTs  and  starting  materials  using   an\nAutolab system with a PGSTAT30 potentiostat\/galvanostat with associated General Purpose Electrochemical  System\n(GPES) software. The electrode system  consisted  of  a  glassy  carbon  (GC)  working  electrode,  a  platinum  gauze\ncounter electrode, and a Ag\/AgNO3 reference electrode with a salt bridge containing 0.1M TBAP in  acetonitrile.  The\nelectrochemical properties of materials  were  determined  in  0.1  M  TBAP  in  dry  degassed  acetonitrile.  Modified\nelectrodes were formed by dispersing the  composites  in  DMF  with  ultrasonication  followed  by  evaporation  onto\nglassy carbon disks in successive layers under high-vacuum.\n2.2         Materials\nAll chemicals, single wall CNTs (HiPCo produced SWNT, CNI), sulphuric acid (Ajax  Finechem),  nitric  acid  (Ajax\nFinechem),  30%  (v\/v)  hydrogen  peroxide  solution   (Merck),   N,N\u2019-dicyclohexyl   carbodiimide   (DCC,   Sigma),\ntetrahydrofuran (THF, Ajax Finechem), sulfanilic acid (Ajax Finechem), sodium nitrate (Aldrich),  sodium  hydroxide\n(BDH), acetone (Ajax Finechem), acetonitrile sodium dodeylsulfate (SDS), tetrabutylammonium perchlorate  (TBAP,\nACROS), salmon sperm DNA (Nippon  Chemical  Feed  Co.  Ltd.-  Japan),  hyaluronic  acid  (HA,  Sigma),  chitosan\n(Jakwang Co. Ltd.), chondroitin sulphate (CS,  ICN-Biochemicals  -  Ohio,  USA),  heparin  (Hep,  Sigma),  N-methyl\npyrrolidone  (NMP)  (Sigma),  Triton   X-100   (Sigma),   sodium   dodecylsulfate   (SDS)   (Sigma),   Poly(styrene-b-\nisobutylene-b-styrene) (SIBS, Boston Scientific) were used as received.  Trans-1-((2\u2019,2\u2019\u2019:5\u2019\u2019,2\u2019\u2019\u2019-terthiophen)-3\u2019\u2019-yl)-\n2-(4\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019-aminophenyl)ethene (TerTh-NH2) was prepared by the quantitative  reduction  of  the  analogous  nitrophenyl\nderivative [[lxx]] and has been reported elsewhere [[lxxi]].\n2.3         Covalent attachment\n2.3.1                                Oxidation and shortening (carboxylation) of CNTs\nOxidation of SWNTs (20 mg) was carried out with sonication in H2SO4 (98%):HNO3 (70%) (3:1, 20 mL) for  periods\nof 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours. Following sonication each sample  was  diluted  with  de-ionised  water  and  centrifuged  at\n2400g for 30 minutes. The supernatant was decanted and  the  sediment  re-dispersed  with  de-ionised  water  and  re-\ncentrifuged. This step was repeated until the pH of the oxidised SWNT dispersion  reached  neutrality.  Solid  samples\nfor analysis were obtained by filtering the dispersion through a PVDF membrane (0.2  \u00b5m)  and  washing  extensively\nwith   water,   followed   by    drying    under    high-vacuum.    SWNTs    (100    mg)    oxidised    for    8    hours    in\nH2SO4 (98%):HNO3 (70%) (3:1) were shortened by treatment with 4:1 H2SO4 (98%):H2O2 (30%) at 70\u00b0C for  30  min\nwith stirring. The reaction mixture was then diluted with 500 mL of  ice  cold  H2O,  and  centrifuged  and  filtered  as\ndescribed above to yield the final product (20 mg).\n2.3.2                                Terthiophene attachment\nOxidised and shortened SWNTs (20 mg) were activated using DCC (140 mg)  in  THF  followed  by  the  addition  of\nTerTh-NH2 (50 mg). This reaction mixture was sonicated for 24 hrs, filtered through a PVDF membrane (0.2 \u00b5m) and\ndried under high-vacuum. Extensive sonicating in THF followed by filtration and  washing  was  carried  out  until  no\nTerTh-NH2 starting material was detected in the filtrate by UV spectroscopy.\n2.3.3                                Sulfonation\nSWNTs  were  functionalised  as  described  previously  [[lxxii]]  using  sulfanilic  acid  as  the  4-substituted  aniline.\nTypically SWNTs (60 mg, 5.0 mmol carbon) were  stirred  with  sulfanilic  acid  (4.0  equiv\/mol  of  carbon),  sodium\nnitrite (4.0 equiv\/mol of carbon) and sulphuric acid (4.8 equiv\/mol of carbon) as a paste for one  hour  at  60\u00b0C  under\nN2 to yield SWNT-PhSO3Na (Scheme 1).  The paste was diluted with acetone and filtered through a PVDF membrane\n(0.45 \u00b5m). The collected solid was washed with acetone until the filtrate became colourless. The resulting black  solid\nwas briefly sonicated in dilute aq. NaOH to  remove  any  unreacted  sulfanilic  acid  and  the  dispersion  was  filtered\nthrough a PVDF membrane (0.45 \u00b5m), followed by rinsing with  dilute  aq.  NaOH  and  water.  The  solid  was  dried\nunder vacuum for 2 hours at 60\u00b0C to  give  a  product  in  which  1  in  18  carbons  were  functionalised  by  a  phenyl\nsulfonate group; 5.6% sulfonate content as determined by elemental analysis.\n4. Non-covalent attachment of Biomolecules\nDNA-SWNT dispersions were prepared from an aqueous solution of DNA (0.4 wt %) containing SWNT in a  ratio  of\n1:1, which was ultra-sonicated using pulse (2s on, 1s off) for 30 minutes using a  high  power  sonic  tip  (500W,  30%\namplitude).  HA-SWNT  dispersions,  1:1  (0.4  wt  %),  Chitosan-SWNT  dispersions,  1:1  (0.4  wt  %),  Hep-SWNT\ndispersions, 1:1 (0.4 wt %) and CS-SWNT dispersions, 1:1 (0.4 wt %), were prepared in a  similar  manner  described\nfor the DNA-SWNT dispersions.\n2.5         Polymer Intercalation into CNT Mats\nA commercial multi-wall buckypaper was obtained from NanoLab (Boston,  USA)  and  used  unaltered.  The  single-\nwall nanotube buckypapers were produced  via  the  addition  of  approximately  120  mg  of  SWNT  (batch  numbers\nPO234 or PO276) to 80 mL of 1% v\/v Triton-X 100 (Sigma), or 1% v\/v sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) (Sigma), which\nwas then sonicated using a sonic horn (Sonics Vibra-Cell, 500W) at 30% intensity, pulsed at 2 seconds  on,  1  second\noff for 2hrs. Following horn sonication, the dispersion was placed in a sonic bath  (Unisonics  Australia  150W)  for  2\nhours. After sonication, the dispersion was vacuum filtered using a 0.22\u00b5m PVDF  membrane.  The  filtrate  was  then\nwashed with 1 L of Milli-Q water followed by 1 L of ethanol, and  subsequently  allowed  to  air  dry  before  removal\nfrom the membrane.\nStrips of 10x3mm CNT (bucky) paper were prepared for the intercalation study via the aid of a cutting  template.  The\nstrips were then weighed using a 6  decimal  place  microbalance.  Before  intercalation,  the  buckypaper  strips  were\nplaced in an annealing furnace under argon at 400\u00b0C for a time of 2 hours. The strips  were  then  soaked  for  varying\nlengths of time in 2 mL of a 5%  w\/v  SIBS\/NMP  stock  solution.  After  soaking,  the  intercalated  carbon  nanotube\nsamples were placed in a vial of absolute ethanol for one hour to allow  the  NMP  to  diffuse  out  of  the  intercalated\nSIBS. Following this secondary soaking the bucky paper was placed in an oven at 60\u00b0C for 18  hours  to  remove  any\nremaining solvent, before being re-weighed.\n3            Results and Discussion\n3.1         Covalent attachment\nA number of examples involving either covalent or non covalent  attachment  to  CNTs  are  presented  and  discussed\nbelow.\n3.1.1                                Carboxylation\nPerhaps the simplest route to covalent modification  of  CNTs  involves  acid  oxidation  to  introduce  COOH  groups\naccording to Scheme 1. It is well established that such oxidations open the ends of  CNTs  and  introduces  carboxylic\nacid groups onto the open ends [15].  However, oxygenation of defect sites on the CNT walls will also occur  and  this\nmay lead to complete tube destruction, depending on the source of the CNTs [[lxxiii]].\nScheme 1  Reaction scheme for carboxylating CNTs\nEven this simple chemistry highlights some of  the  challenges  that  are  encountered.  Oxidation  of  the  SWNTs\nresults in the emergence of two peaks in the FT-IR spectrum (not shown) at 2919 and 2850 cm-1. Similar peaks  occur\nat 2917 and 2840 cm-1 for SWNTs functionalised with octadecyl alcohol and the peaks are cited as belonging  to  C-H\nstretch modes of the alkyl chain [[lxxiv]]. There is the possibility that these  are  related  to  dangling  aliphatic  bonds\nfrom the harsh oxidation process. The emergence of  a  peak  at  1637  cm-1  after  acid  treatment  corresponds  to  the\ncarboxylate groups. The IR spectra for pristine SWNTs show little structure.\nTypical Raman spectra obtained for SWNTs before functionalisation are shown in Figure 1. The use of a  24  hour\nreaction time which, is widely reported, led in our case to  the  disappearance  in  Raman  spectra  of  radial  breathing\nmodes characteristic of SWNTs, suggesting disintegration of the nanotubes (not shown). TEM analysis confirmed  the\ndestruction of the CNTs (Figure 2(b)). Altering this oxidation time between 2 and 8 hours  amplifies  the  intensity  of\nthe D-band in Raman spectra at 1310  cm-1  (Figure  1)  with  respect  to  the  intensity  of  the  G-band  at  1590  cm-1,\nindicating successful oxidation of the sample, while retaining CNT  structure  (Figure  2(c))  at  least  at  these  shorter\nreaction times. These oxidised CNTs can be dispersed in  water  using  sonication  to  provide  dispersions  which  are\nstable for days, in contrast to the raw CNT material, which falls out  of  suspension  immediately  when  sonication  is\nceased.\nFigure 1  Raman spectra obtained after different reaction  times  for  acid  oxidation  of  SWNTs  (Detailed  in  EXPERIMENTAL\nSECTION).\n3.1.2                                Attachment of Terthiophene\nLiu et al.[1] first reported how etching CNTs can be achieved using  piranha  solution  to  produce  CNTs  as  short  as\n100nm. TEM images (Figure 2(d), (e) and (f)) of these \u201ccut\u201d SWNTs suggest a  cleaner  sample  than  the  as-received\nstarting material, however it was difficult to determine the extent of  cutting  due  to  very  tight  roping  and  bundling\n(Figure 2(d) and (e)). This severe bundling of the shortened SWNTs impeded their dispersion in water in  comparison\nto acid oxidized SWNTs. Dispersing \u201ccut\u201d nanotubes in an aqueous solution of DBSA  allowed  individual  nanotubes\nto be seen using TEM (Figure 2(f)). Reducing the length of  CNTs  was  expected  to  increase  the  active  end  group\ncontent and hence ratio of functionalised groups to carbon.\nThiophene-based polymers are being investigated for application in photovoltaic  devices  due  to  their  unusually\nhigh open-circuit voltages [[lxxv],[lxxvi]], field emission devices [[lxxvii]], and  supercapacitors  containing  polymer\ncoated MWNTs [[lxxviii]]. Modifying SWNTs with  a  terthiophene  monomer  was  envisaged  to  provide  enhanced\nsolubility in a polymer matrix through co-polymerisation  with  a  terthiophene  monomer.  To  this  end  the  carboxyl\ngroups of shortened SWNT were subjected to amidation with terthiophene-phenyl-amine according to Scheme 2.\nThere was little shift in the position of the FT-IR band attributed to  the  carboxyl  group  of  the  oxidized  sample\nSWNT-COOH (1637 cm-1) compared to the amidated sample SWNT-TerTh (1640 cm-1). Similarly no  great  changes\nare observed in the Raman spectrum of  SWNT-COOH  compared  to  SWNT-TerTh  e.g.  RBM  peak  shifts  are  not\nsignificant (not shown). This is not entirely unexpected since we are only modifying existing functional groups on the\nCNTs and not creating new ones on the CNT sidewalls.\nFigure 2  TEM images of (a) raw SWNTs, (b) SWNTs after 24 hrs acid oxidation, (c) SWNTs after 8 hrs oxidation, (d) and (e) cut\nSWNTs after 30 mins H2O2 and (f), cut SWNTs after 30 mins H2O2 dispersed in 1% DBSA solution.\n\nScheme 2  Reaction scheme for attaching TerTh-NH2 to CNTs\nEvidence of functionalisation  is  observed  in  the  absorption  spectrum  of  the  terthiophene  adduct  (Figure  3).\nDespite extensive sonication, filtering and washing of the SWNT-TerTh adduct, a broad band is seen,  which  may  be\nassigned to the  TerTh-NH2  moiety.  This  is  not  direct  evidence  of  covalent  functionalisation  however,  since  no\nobvious amide NH-stretch was detected in the FT-IR spectrum and it is known that the carboxylates  of  SWNTs  may\nform ionic salts with amines [[lxxix]].\nFigure 3  UV spectra of raw SWNT, SWNT after 8 hours oxidation (SWNT-COOH) and the SWNT-terthiophene adduct  (SWNT-\nTerTh).\nCyclic  voltammograms  for  SWNT-TerTh  and  the  related  terthiophene   monomer   do   not   appear   to   have\nappreciable  shifts  in  peak  potentials  (not  shown).  Polymerisation  of  the  terthiophene  compound   as   a   SWNT\ncomposite may be occurring at approximately 0.8 V. The fact that the signal for  the  initial  cycle  is  so  much  larger\nthan that for subsequent scans may indicate that there is only a limited amount of material  residing  very  near  to  the\nelectrode surface. Voltammograms for the composite co-adsorbed onto  the  glassy  carbon  electrode  with  additional\nTerTh-NH2 (50% wt) appear nearly identical with only a  slight  increase  in  peak  currents.  Any  faradaic  responses\nattributed to the terthiophene moiety or any polymer formed is likely to be swamped by the huge capacitance  currents\nobserved when using CNTs.\nThis  example  serves   to   illustrate   the   challenges   encountered   in   providing   detailed   characterisation   of\nfunctionalised tubes. The low degree of functionalisation decreasing with longer tube length  makes  detection  of  the\nattached moieties difficult to observe.\n3.1.3 Sulfonation\nThe procedure described by Dyke for the functionalisation of SWNTs using diazonium  chemistry  was  followed  and\nemployed sulfanilic acid as the 4-substituted aniline [72] (Scheme 3).\nScheme 3  Reaction scheme for sulfonating CNTs\nSingle wall carbon nanotubes in which 1 in 18 carbons were functionalised by a phenyl sulfonate  group  [SWNT-\nPhSO3Na] were obtained by this reaction, with sulfonate content as determined by  elemental  analysis  of  5.6%.  The\nfunctionalised  SWNTs  (SWNT-PhSO3Na)  were  readily  dispersed  in  water  (up  to  0.3%  w\/v).  SWNT-PhSO3Na\ndispersed sparingly in ethanol and isopropanol, poorly in 1,2-dichloroethane and DMF,  and  not  at  all  in  DMPU  or\nTHF, which contrasts with the raw SWNT starting material.\nDue to the manufacturer\u2019s acidic purification treatment and the presence of amorphous  carbon  particles,  a  small\ndisorder band (D band) at 1320 cm-1 is  present  in  the  Raman  spectrum  of  the  raw  SWNT  starting  material  (not\nshown). In comparison the spectrum of SWNT-PhSO3Na shows a significant increase in the disorder mode relative to\nthe tangential mode (G-band at 1590 cm-1), which indicates a significant conversion of sp2 hybridised  carbons  in  the\nsample to sp3. This disorder band change and the change in the radial breathing modes of the functionalised nanotubes\nwhen compared to the as-received SWNTs are consistent with sidewall functionalisation [[lxxx]].\nCNT (bucky) papers were prepared from  these  dispersions  using  the  procedures  outlined  in  the  Experimental\nSection. The conductivity of bucky paper formed from the SWNT-PhSO3Na  material  was  4.4  \u00b1  0.9  S  cm-1  -  two\norders of magnitude lower than has been reported for pristine SWNT papers. The loss of electrical conductivity of the\nfunctionalised SWNTs is attributed to a high degree of side-wall functionalisation. This again highlights the challenge\nin introducing chemical functionality while retaining the electronic integrity of the tubes.\nThis functionalisation again provides further options in processing\/fabrication of novel materials. For example, we\nhave shown that these sulfonated CNTs are readily incorporated as  \u201cmolecular\u201d  dopants  into  inherently  conducting\npolymers [[lxxxi]].  The  resulting  composite  has  properties  similar  to  those  observed  with  other  polyelectrolyte\ndopants. The sulfonated CNTs have also been shown to  enhance  the  co-incorporation  of  an  enzyme  (horse  radish\nperoxidase) and enhance the performance of a biosensor based on the use of SWNT-PhSO3- PPy+.\n3.2         Non-covalent attachment\n3.2.1                                Attaching Biomolecules\nAs reviewed in the introduction, non covalent attachment may provide a simpler route to attachment of more complex\nfunctional molecules. For example, we have recently  extended  our  earlier  studies  using  biomolecules  as  effective\ndispersants [68, 69] to include the functional molecules shown in Scheme 4. The  biomolecules  of  particular  interest\ninclude DNA, hyaluronic acid (HA), chitosan (Chit), heparin (Hep) and chondroitin sulfate (CS).\nThe SWNT-biomolecule dispersions were  obtained  by  sonicating  a  given  amount  of  SWNTs  in  an  aqueous\nsolution of biomolecule, to form biomolecule-SWNT  suspensions.  Optical  micrographs  of  CNT  dispersions  made\nwith some of these biomolecules are shown in  Figure  4.  In  the  case  of  DNA  and  HA,  a  1:1  ratio  by  weight  of\nbiomolecule: SWNT was employed to form highly stable dispersions, contrasting greatly with reports published using\nsurfactants where ratios of 2:1,[[lxxxii]] and 3:1,[[lxxxiii]] were required.\nInterestingly in the case of chitosan, heparin and chondroitin sulfate a 1:1 ratio by weight of  biomolecule:  SWNT\nwas not sufficient to create stable dispersions. The formation of micelles that cause  depletion  attraction  between  the\nCNTs and their bundles\nScheme 4  Structures of biomolecules used as SWNT dispersant and coagulants, (a)  Chitosan,  (b)  Hyaluronic  Acid,\n(c) Chondroitin Sulfate and (d) Heparin.\n                     (a)                                                                                             (b)\n(c)                                                                                  (d)\nFigure 4  Optical micrographs of a dispersion of (a) 0.4 wt % DNA and 0.4 wt % SWNT (b) 0.4 wt % HA  and  0.4  wt  %  SWNT\nand (c) 0.4 wt % Chitosan and 0.4  wt  %  SWNT.  In  the  Chitosan  dispersion  (c)  micrometer  sized  clusters  can  be\nobserved at the resolution of the optical microscope, indicating that the amount of dispersant is  insufficient.  The  scale\nbar in image (c) is applicable to all images.\n(a)                                                                              (b)                                                   \n(c)\nled to large aggregates which, were observed in optical micrographs and correspond  to  poorly  dispersed  bundles  of\nCNTs. This is surprising since the structure of HA and CS differs only  in  the  presence  of  a  sulfate  group  and  the\nstereochemistry of an OH-group; HA does not induce depletion aggregation between CNT bundles. These very  slight\nstructural changes have an enormous impact on the nature of CNT dispersions  made  with  these  biomolecules.  This\nbehaviour     reflects     stronger     binding     interactions     between     HA\/DNA      and      CNTs      compared      to\nchitosan\/heparin\/chondroitin sulfate.\nSuch non-covalent biomolecule functionalisation provides a route to subsequent processing to form CNT mats  by\nfiltration [[lxxxiv]] or possibly even CNT fibres via wet spinning using processes described previously [69].\n3.2.2                                Functionalising Preformed CNT Structures\nAll of the above approaches involve functionalising the CNTs prior to forming a practically useful structure such as  a\nfibre or a mat. Only limited examples involve functionalising the actual structure.  For  example,  Dai  and  coworkers\nutilised aligned carbon nanotubes as electrodes onto which a bioactive conducting polymer (PPy-GOD) was deposited\n[[lxxxv]]. Many other  examples  exist  in  the  literature  where  redox  proteins  [[lxxxvi]],  metal  oxides  [[lxxxvii]],\naromatic dyes [[lxxxviii]], fluoroscein [[lxxxix]] porphyrins [[xc]] or DNA [[xci]] have  been  post-immobilised  onto\npre-formed aligned carbon nanotube architectures.\nThe advantage of this approach is that the structure can be formed in an optimal environment which  may  involve\nconditions detrimental to the functional groups. An example of this approach involves  simple  intercalation  of  active\npolymers into preformed CNT architectures (see Scheme 5).  Here we have used this approach to produce  CNT  mats\ninto which  a  commonly  used  biomaterial  is  intercalated.  Poly(styrene-b-isobutylene-b-styrene)  (SIBS)  is  a  bio-\ncompatible tri-block copolymer which has shown exceptionally good controlled release properties  for  certain  drugs,\neven being commercially available in the form of the TAXUStm drug stent from Boston Scientific [[xcii]].\nThree different bucky-papers prepared from solutions containing different dispersants were  assembled  (Figure  5\nshows SEM images) in this study. It is obvious that the morphology of the papers is vastly different and dependant on\nthe dispersant used to initially stabilise the tubes in solution. It can be  expected  that  the  diffusion  of  polymers  into\nsuch morphologies would be different in each case. Previous studies have shown this to be the  case,  with  infiltration\nparticularly dependent on polymer molecular weight [[xciii]].  Strips  of  buckypaper  cut  from  the  papers  shown  in\nFigure 5, were soaked in a  SIBS  solution  prepared  in  NMP  or  toluene  for  times  ranging  from  0  to  48  hr.  Not\nsurprisingly, the polymer uptake increased as a function of time, generally  saturating  after  a  period  of  18  hr.  This\ncorrelated to an uptake of up to 30% polymer by weight, dependent on the porous structure of the papers (Figure 5 (c)\n> (a) > (b)).\nScheme 5   Schematic  showing  the  steps  involved  in  preparing  the  polymer  intercalated  carbon  nanotube  mats\n(buckypaper).\nFigure 5  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of carbon nanotube  architectures;  cross  sectional  image  of  bucky-paper\nprepared from (a) single-wall nanotubes (Triton X-100 dispersion); (b) multi-wall nanotubes (Triton X-100 dispersion);\n(c) single-wall nanotubes (SDS dispersion); (d) after intercalation of SIBS into mat shown in (c).\nRaman spectra of SIBS, MWNT and the MWNT\/SIBS composites were obtained (Figure 6). Since SIBS is shown\nto be Raman active in the 180-300cm-1 region, which is known to be the radial breathing modes of single-wall  carbon\nnanotubes, MWNT composites are shown in this instance for comparison. The composite spectrum  shown  in  Figure\n6(b) clearly shows Raman bands that can be attributed to the  individual  components  of  the  composite.  Figure  6(c)\nshows the theoretical Raman spectrum expected for a composite of both MWNT and SIBS. It can be clearly seen  that\nFigure 6(b) and (c) are almost identical, indicating a true composite formation.\nFigure 6  Raman spectrum of (a) SIBS, (b) SIBS\/MWNT composite, (c) theoretical composite, and (d) MWNT.\nFigure 7 shows the shift in wavenumber (cm-1) as a function of polymer intercalation (soak time  (hr))  for  one  of\nthe radial breathing mode peaks of the single-wall nanotube\/SIBS composite. It can be easily observed that there  is  a\nstrong correlation between the SIBS soak times and the  nanotube  environment,  as  there  is  a  considerable  shift  in\nwavenumber (~6cm-1) as more SIBS is incorporated into the nanotube architecture. This result implies  that  the  SIBS\nis indeed interacting strongly with the nanotube bundles, changing the local electronic environment. Not  surprisingly,\nthe intercalation of an insulating polymer, such as SIBS, results in a decrease in conductivity across the nanotube  mat\n(measured using 4-point probe). For example, for the CNT structure shown in Figure 5(a)  conductivity  decreased  an\norder of magnitude down to 0.1 S cm-1 after intercalation of SIBS up to 15% (w\/w). The mechanical properties of  the\nresultant material are also affected  by  the  intercalation  process.  The  results  show  that  the  CNT\/SIBS  composite\nmodulus increases with increased intercalation of SIBS. Modulus increases from 211 to 850MPa were found to  occur\nat low polymer intercalation levels (<20%). Strength values were also found to increase from  5.6MPa  for  the  native\nbucky paper, up to 16.7MPa  at  polymer  intercalation  levels  of  20%.  These  trends  are  similar  to  those  reported\npreviously [[xciv]]. The biocompatibility of the resultant CNT\/SIBS material has  been  the  focus  of  a  recent  paper\n[[xcv]], which reported the successful growth of L-929 (mouse fibroblast) cells on SWNT\/SIBS composites.\nFigure 7  Shift in Radial Breathing Mode peak wavenumber as a function of polymer intercalation (soak time (hr)).\nConclusions\nIn order to  realise  the  diverse  array  of  potential  applications  for  carbon  nanotubes  it  is  necessary  to  introduce\nchemical or biological functionality. The area has been aggressively tackled over the past decade or so and  a  number\nof strategies pursued. These include a myriad of approaches to enable covalent attachment or non covalent attachment\nprior to structure fabrication. Alternatively functionality may be attached or integrated  into  the  CNT  structure  after\nfabrication (e.g. intercalating functional polymers into mats).\nDespite  major  advances,  challenges  still  remain.  All  of  the  strategies  introduced   to   date   introduce   some\ncompromise in the electronic and physical properties of the CNTs  and\/or  the  structures  produced  using  them.  The\nability to quantify and provide information on the distribution of functional groups  along  CNTs  and  structures  also\ncurrently eludes us. To ensure a high level of confidence in the performance of devices  that  will  be  based  on  these\nmaterials this information must eventually be secured.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to the Australian Research Council for financial support.\nFinancial support from Fulbright New Zealand for SEH and the  MacDiarmid  Institute  for  Advanced  Materials  and\nNanotechnology is also gratefully acknowledged.\nReferences\n---------------------------------------\n[i]           Liu, J., Rinzler, A.G., Dai, H., Hafner, J.H., Bradley, R.K.,  Boul,  P.J.,  Lu,  A.,  Iverson,  T.,  Shelimov,  K.,\nHuffman, C.B., Rodriguez-Macias, F., Shon, Y.-S., Lee, T.R., Colbert, D.T., Smalley, R.E.
