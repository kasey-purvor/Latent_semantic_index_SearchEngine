Since then, the \u201eexport\u201f of risk from the Western economies of the global \n\u201eNorth\u201f to those of the unevenly developing \u201fSouth\u201f has continued and the \nincreased pollution from across the globe has led to serious concerns about its \nimpact on climate change. Thus, globalisation is a double-edged sword in risk \nterms. Globalisation is not, however, a new phenomenon as capitalism from the \noutset was constituted via processes of combined and uneven development that \nbrought various scattered parts of the globe into systemically unequal \nrelationships with one another. There are numerous accounts of the successive \nforms of the international division of labour and changing socio-spatial forms of \nglobalisation (see, for example, see Hirst and Thompson, 1995). Rather our \nconcern here is to focus on the latest neo-liberal phase of globalisation, its \ndefining features and their implications for the health and well-being of people. \nNow as then - and despite assertions to the contrary about globalisation \nheralding \u201ethe end of geography\u201f (O\u201fBrien, 1992) \u2013 the geography of \ncontemporary globalisation remains one of profound combined and uneven \ndevelopment, characterised by sharpened socio-spatial inequalities as the \npolitical-economy of neo-liberalism and neo-liberal thought have become \nincreasingly dominant in the policy discourse and practices of the leading \nnational states and international organisations such as the World Bank and IMF.  \nThe combination of economic factors, the export of hazardous activities, \nprocesses and materials, along with the uneven regulatory spaces within which \nthese activities are contextualised generates a landscape of risk that is shaped \nby the processes of contemporary globalisation. The perceptible shift in the \nregulation of economies towards one constituted within a neo-liberal framework \nhas resulted in a  considerable emphasis on the \u201efreeing up\u201f of market forces \nnationally and also the opening the national and sub-national economies and \nlabour markets to the disciplining forces of international markets. These are \n 3 \nchanges with direct consequences in terms of enhanced risks to the health and \nwell-being of many millions of people, although their effects have been \nexperienced to differing degrees in different parts of the world. This paper seeks \nto explore these issues and to raise questions about the long-term implications \nthat these shifts may have for public health risk, especially  in recently developing \ncountries. Before examining these issues in more detail, it is first necessary to \nexamine the facets of contemporary neo-liberal globalisation that serve as the \ndriving force behind the generation of these risks. \n \n \nWhat\u2019s new about contemporary neo-liberal globalisation?  \n \nThe net effect of the adoption of neo-liberal policy positions has been that in the \ncourse of their daily lives many people live in increasingly risky and unhealthy \nenvironments. In addition, they also experience increased risks of unemployment \nand worklessness and often have to undertake forms of employment that militate \nagainst good health and well-being. There are several reasons as to why this is \nso.  \n \nFirstly, and perhaps most importantly, the pre-eminence attached to market \nforces in general and the forces of global markets in particular as the prime \nmechanism for steering and disciplining economies \u2013 whether national, regional \nor corporate \u2013 has been decisive and defining.  This, above all else, has enabled \nthe enhanced globalisation of capital, which has resulted in the latest phase of \ncombined and uneven development. That said, it is important to appreciate that \nthese are by no means natural market forces but rather a product of the ways in \nwhich markets have been politically constructed and regulated, not least by \npowerful national states. Ironically, it is those nation states that often have the \nmost stringent regulatory frameworks in place for environmental impact and \nhealth and safety within their own national territories. The resultant paradox is \n 4 \nthat the political construction of markets \u201cat home\u201d may have the effect of \ngenerating risky environments abroad. \n \nThis greater emphasis upon the role of market forces has had a number of \nconsequences, of which three are of significance in the present context. First, \nthere has been a significant extension of the commodity form, with two important \nimplications. On the one hand, there has been a re-drawing of the boundary \nbetween private and public sectors.  Expanded commodification has led to the \nreplacement of state provision (of jobs, housing, goods and services) as an \nentitlement of citizens with provision via markets to customers - not all of whom, \nof course, are able to afford them.  On the other, there has been an extension of \nthe realm of the commodity form into areas of private and community life, and \ninto the sphere of civil society, from which it was previously excluded by \ncustomary practices and tradition. These changes have further emphasised the \nimportance for many people of access to waged work in order to gain access to \nthe goods and services central to health and well-being in the course of everyday \nlife. In certain cases, access to waged work is also a means of accessing \neffective health care provision at a level above that of a \u201esafety net\u201f. This can \neither be directly, in terms of access to health care insurance, or indirectly as a \nfunction of spatial location (referred to in the UK as the so-called \u201cpost code \nlottery\u201d).  \n \nSecondly, the re-structuring of markets has reduced the predictability and \ncertainty of transactions and introduced greater risk and uncertainty for those \nreliant upon markets for the supply of employment and provision of services. The \ninterconnected nature of  these markets and the manner in which a failure in one \nmarket can cascade through to others was illustrated by the collapse of the sub-\nprime market in the USA in 2008 and the impact that it had on bank performance \nin the UK (notably that of Northern Rock). Within this highly interconnected \ncontext,  employment has become increasing precarious and temporary (for \nexample, see Beck, 1992) where before it was secure and long-term. In addition \n 5 \nto this problem, the spatial inequalities that exist in terms of access to jobs and \nservices has also been amplified.   \n \nThirdly, there has been a growing selective incorporation of these new market \nprinciples into the residual public sector, expressed in the erosion of trust and \ngrowth of a culture of audit and monitoring. The result is an organisational \nenvironment in which a number of concerns and problems have emerged. These \ninclude, amongst others, the setting and meeting of targets (many of which do \nnot relate to core service performance); with a range of pseudo-profitability \ncriteria that have been set for public service agencies; and with the re-working of \nthe public-private sector divide so that the qualitative distinction between public \nand private sector provision has been significantly eroded.  \n \nThese tendencies have been seen to operate more strongly in some countries \nthan others but few parts of the world have escaped their effects. A defining \nfeature of this development has therefore been the growing influence of markets \nas allocation mechanisms coupled with the tilting of market forces and laws of \ncontract in favour of employers and selected categories of employees, while \nincreasing the general level of insecurity and risk of job loss for the (much \ngreater) majority. These are changes with important implications for the health \nand well-being of workers and those people who are dependent upon them.  This \nincreased emphasis on global market forces has in turn emphasised the critical \nsignificance of the competitive strategies of major multinational companies, the \ndeployment of different mixes of \u201eweak\u201f and \u201estrong\u201f competitive strategies, often \ninvolving new forms of inter-firm co-operative relationships and strategic \nalliances, and the new geographies of production and work that these create via \nprocesses of out-sourcing and\/or off-shoring as the pace of capital movement \nquickens (Hudson, 2001). Over thirty years ago Damette (1974; translated 1980) \ncoined the term \u201ehypermobility of capital\u201f to describe this accelerating mobility of \ncapital as the turnover time of fixed capital is progressively reduced as capital is \nwritten-off and amortised over shorter time periods \u2013 a salutary reminder that \n 6 \nsuch processes are by no means new. As a result the pace at which capital is \ndevalorised in some places and abandons them and penetrates and is fixed in \nothers has accelerated both in the cities and regions of the global \u201eSouth\u201f and in \nparts of the peripheries of the global \u201eNorth\u201f1.  \n \nAccelerated movement of capital in turn has implications for intensified \ncompetition between places and workers for waged work and increases the risks \nof people in a particular place becoming surplus to the requirements of capital. \nWaged work becomes increasingly precarious, increasing the risks of \nunemployment and worklessness as jobs disappear from one place to be re-\nlocated elsewhere. Given the known close links between work, identity and well-\nbeing, this carries obvious risks for those who become redundant in the process. \nAs the economic well-being of a place is eroded, then the ability of governments \nto fund health and welfare programmes from tax revenues is also impaired. The \ncombination of increased problems of poor health by virtue of joblessness (and \nthe potential for associated issues around environmental quality) and the \nimpairment of healthcare provision is a double blow to such places. \n \nIssues of environmental quality and its impact on public health, especially linked \nto the location of noxious and pollutant industrial processes \u2013 captured in the \nphenomenon of NIMBYism and its catchphrase \u201cNot in my backyard\u201d have \nbecome increasingly significant. In part, these pre-date the latest phase of \n                                                 \n1\n \n1\n In the remainder of the paper I draw a contrast, but also note some similarities, between \nchanges in the global \u201eNorth\u201f and \u201eSouth\u201f.  I do so partly for ease of exposition, partly because \nthere are significant developmental differences between \u201eNorth\u201f and \u201eSouth\u201f. At this point, \nhowever, I want to enter a qualification, to recognise that this binary dichotomy is an over-\nsimplification. The global movements of capital and people have led to elements of the \u201eSouth\u201f \nlocating in the \u201eNorth\u201f; and vice versa. For example, many of the successful urban and regional \neconomies of the \u201eNorth\u201f depend critically upon corporeal movements of migrant workers from the \n\u201eSouth\u201f. Again, with the rise of the Chinese and Indian economies (Engardio, 2007; Walker and \nBuck, 2007) and the acquisition of major companies in the \u201eNorth\u201f by those based in the \u201eSouth\u201f \n(for example, of Corus by Tata and Acelor by Mittal), the meaning of these two terms is becoming \nincreasingly blurred and relations between \u201eNorth\u201f and \u201eSouth\u201f increasingly complicated as new \npatterns of combined and uneven development emerge. It is also worth noting, however, that \nbecause capitalist development in inherently combined and uneven, there is no guarantee that \nChina and India will continue to be centres of rapid economic growth and  capital accumulation as \nthe accumulation process is chronically one that erodes the place-based conditions if its success. \n \n 7 \nglobalisation as people in more economically developed countries came to \nunderstand the dangers posed by noxious pollutants and environmental \nstandards were raised in response, many polluting industries were re-located to \nparts of the \u201eSouth\u201f, The accident at Bhopal in 1984 was a poignant reminder of \nthe ways in which certain multinational companies also exported hazardous \nprocesses as well as products. In this case, the Indian plant was of \u201esimilar\u201f \ndesign to that operated in the USA, but the standards of maintenance that were \nin operation fell far short of those that would be allowed in a highly regulated \ncountry. Whilst Union Carbide was accused of double standards in allowing such \na practice in one of its subsidiaries, it managed to effectively deflect much of that \nblame to its Indian subsidiary. In some cases, the waste products of the \u201eNorth\u201f, \nwhich were expensive to dispose of in a highly regulated environment, were also \nexported to the \u201eSouth\u201f. In addition to the re-locationof pollutant and risky \nprocesses, however, a second major feature of the neo-liberal era became the \ngrowing globalisation of wastes flows and new forms of trade in wastes. For \nexample, stringent regulations on re-cycling were introduced in Germany in the \n1990s. Picking through waste to sort and re-cycle it is labour intensive, poorly \npaid and of low social esteem. As such, it is exported to peripheral parts of the \nglobal economy \u2013 and justified as creating employment there! A particularly \nstriking example of the new trade in wastes is the scrapping and re-cycling of \nships on the beaches of Bangladesh (Chittagong: see Buerk, 2006) and India \n(Alang). Although international regulatory and trade agreements have halted the \nworst excesses of the trade in noxious wastes, they have failed to stop it. \nConsequently, the global \u201eNorth\u201f still offloads its wastes onto the \u201eSouth\u201f.  \nHowever, the international trade in pollutant materials and wastes is a complex \none, with wastes transported to peripheral locations within the\u201f North\u201f. For \nexample, wastes produced in the steel industry in England and Wales are \nshipped to Germany and Italy for remediation, nuclear waste has been shipped \nfrom Japan to Sellafield in north west England for re-processing there and \nderelict USA and French warships, replete with a variety of noxious substances \n 8 \n(including asbestos and PCBs: BAN, 2003), have been moved to Hartlepool in \nnorth east England for dismantling and disposal.  \n \nExporting wastes in this way was cheaper than dealing with them at home, and \nmade easier when recipient countries were misled about the nature of the wastes \nand\/or had authoritarian non-elected governments who neither knew nor cared. \nPerhaps more significantly, dealing with pollutants at home could entail political \ncosts, in the face of NIMBYism and opposition by local communities to wastes \nbeing treated in \u201ctheir back yard\u201d (Smith 1991; Smith and Blowers 1991). \nHowever, local communities have differential capacity to resist, as the examples \nof Hartlepool and Sellafield illustrate. Nuclear waste has been re-processed at \nSellafield for some fifty years, with persistent worries about the effects of accidents \nand the exposure of workers and local residents to radiation.  However, Sellafield is \nlocated in a peripheral region, with few other employment opportunities, as is \nHartlepool. This process of noxious activities being located in areas of low \neconomic and political power, and therefore low resistance, is not a new \nphenomena (see Smith, 1990) and as David Harvey (1996, 368) observed,  \n \n \u201cone of the best predictors of the location of toxic waste dumps in the \nUnited States is a geographical concentration of people of low income and \ncolor\u201d.  \n \nIndeed, poorer communities within the \u201eNorth\u201f and \u201eSouth\u201f have engaged in \nbidding wars, seeking to become destinations for hazardous wastes in return for \nmonetary payments and incomes. Some countries are so poor, and in such \ndesperate need of foreign currency earnings (to buy imports or repay foreign \ndebt) that ruling \u00e9lites encourage any trade likely to generate such earnings, \ndiscounting risks to the environment and the health of their populations (an issue \ndiscussed further below).  \n \n 9 \nThe third diagnostic feature of neo-liberal globalisation is the increased \nglobalisation of corporeal flows, of the movement of people in a variety of roles. \nThese include people moving as international migrant workers with varying levels \nof qualification in globally segmented labour markets, many as illegal migrants \nwho lead a precarious and deeply exploited existence in their country of \ndestination as a result, as refugees (who typically lack citizenship rights and may \nalso be illegal migrants), and as tourists. There are powerful arguments that \nprocesses of time\/space compression and convergence have enabled faster, \nmore frequent and more distant flows. While the vast majority of flows of people \nremain within national boundaries and over relatively short distances, there has \nnonetheless been a tremendous growth in movements across national \nboundaries. For example, in 1950 there were 25 million international passenger \narrivals; currently there are over 600 million each year, and the scale of future \nmovements is forecast to increase markedly. The number of international \nmigrants has more than doubled over the period 1965-2000 to 175 million \n(International Organisation for Migration, 2003). From the perspective of disease \ntransmission, the highly connected nature of contemporary societies has \nconsiderable impacts on the spread of diseases, as illustrated by the SARS \noutbreak and the potential that exists for a bird flu pandemic. \n \nThe fourth feature of neo-liberal globalisation of relevance here is the prevalence \nof food shortages and famine. This is a process in which many causal factors \nintegrate together in space-time to generate problems. For example, food \nshortages can be in part induced by climate change and in part because of the \niniquities of food distribution systems, rather than an absolute shortage of food \nper se (Sen, 1983). They may also occur in part because of the proliferation of \n\u201cfailed\u201d or \u201cfragile states\u201d and in part a product of the renewed willingness to have \nrecourse to physical violence and war as a way of dealing with political issues. \nThis has led to death and destruction of peoples\u201f lives on a massive scale (as is \nonly too evident from events Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iraq, and Zimbabwe), in turn \nacting as a major cause of refugee flows. There is some debate as to how to \n 10 \ndefine \u201cfailed\u201d or \u201cfragile\u201d states2 but for DiFD (2005, 7) \u201cfragile states\u201d are those \nin which \u201cthe government cannot or will not deliver core functions to the majority \nof its people, including the poor\u201d.  The phrase \u201ccannot or will not\u201d is a significant \none, sliding over a key difference between those states in which ruling elites \ncould and choose not to deliver core functions such as healthcare and those that \nare simply too poor in the first place for this to be a feasible possibility. This \ngroup of \u201cfailed states\u201d includes but is not limited to those states riven by internal \nconflict and civil wars, and includes those in which problems of corruption in \ngovernment lead to the siphoning off resources from health and health care.  \n \n \nWhat are the Implications for increased risks to health and well-being? \n \nThere are a number of issues to address here. Firstly, there is a wealth of well-\nestablished evidence that a combination of high psychological work demands, \nlow levels of job task control (in terms of both  decision authority and skill \nutilisation) and the perceived (and typically real) risk of job loss leads to \nincreased work related stress and subsequently producing higher rates of \npsychological and physical morbidity (for example, see Benach et al 2002; \nBenach and Muntanser, 2007; Benavides et al 2000; de Vries and Wilkerson \n2003; Dooley et al 1987; Muntaner et al 1998; Wegge et al 2006).  While it is \ndifficult to disentangle the effects of job insecurity and more structural features of \n\u201eprecarious work\u201f from the more general effects of socio-economic status or \nposition (Adler and Newman 2002), these adverse effects on mental and physical \nhealth and well-being have become endemic as competitive pressures have \nintensified, especially as work has become increasingly precarious and\/or \nintensified in the era of neo-liberal globalization. The \u201elean\u201f high performance, \n                                                 \n2\n For example, the World Bank focuses on 30 \u201clow income countries under stress\u201d (World Bank, \n2004), while the UK Government\u201fs Department of International Development recognises 46 \ncountries in a broader list of \u201cfragile countries\u201d, which contain some 900 million inhabitants, or \n14% of the global population (DiFD, 2005).. Between 1990 and 2002 the incomes of these states \nwere stagnant (compared to a 1.2% annual growth in other developing countries \u2013 hardly \nspectacular but at least growth). \n 11 \nhigh volume flexible production (HVFP) plants found in the peripheries of the \n\u201eNorth\u201f often offer the only significant manufacturing employment to be found in \nthese regions. On the positive side, in contrast to Taylorist mass production, \nHVFP approaches require management of the labour process through employee \ncommitment to and involvement in the job via Human Resource Management \n(HRM) and Total Quality Management (TQM) practices. These are better quality \njobs in that there is emphasis on quality enhancement, problem solving rather \nthan machine minding, and longer job-task cycle times. However, these jobs also \nbring with them problems as they are often built around (sometimes conflicting) \nthemes such as flexibility, responsibility, self-development, job enrichment, \ntraining, security of employment, performance-related pay schemes, teamwork \nand improving the commitment and trust of a more valued workforce. Whilst \nmany of these facets of HVFP jobs are deemed to be positive, they can under \ncertain conditions generate additional stress for staff especially as companies \npracticing HVFP strategies also require additional \u201ecommitment\u201f from their \nemployees. This is manifested in requirements such as: greater flexibility in \nallocating workers\u201f time on the line, considerable use of multi-tasking and multi-\nskilling, increased flexibility in the scheduling of overtime, and the reorganisation of \nshifts to ensure that factories and machines produce goods for the maximum time \npossible within regulatory limits. Critics therefore suggest that such forms of \nproduction and work organization intensify the pace of work and are \ncharacterised by new and more subtle methods of control, exploitation and \nsurveillance, intensification of the labour process and stress on workers \n(Okamura and Kawahito, 1990). A supervisor at Nissan\u201fs Washington factory in \nnorth east England commented that in interviewing potential shopfloor workers: \n\u201cWe lay it on the line that its hard work, that they probably haven\u201ft ever worked \nas hard before\u201d (reported in Tighe, 1998). Consequently the intensive pace of \nwork leads to physical injuries, such as repetitive strains and musculo-skeletal \ndisorders (Leslie and Butz, 1998) while the need to maintain quality standards and \nproductivity levels creates psychological stress for those who occupy such jobs \u2013 \n 12 \nand often consider themselves fortunate to do so in regions blighted by \nunemployment and a prevalence of low wage, precarious jobs.  \n \nIn the global \u201fSouth\u201f the proliferation of sweatshops in a range of consumer \ngoods industries, with workers working long hours in poorly lit and poorly \nventilated environments, often amidst noxious materials, and with little autonomy \nor control over their pace of work, also raises serious questions about the health \nand safety of workers and about the use of child labour (recognised, for example, \nin corporate social responsibility campaigns in the \u201eNorth\u201f to improve things in the \n\u201eSouth\u201f: for example, see  Hughes, 2004; 2006). There are widespread problems \nbecause of the use of polluting materials and processes in many industrialising \nparts of the \u201eSouth\u201f (see, for example, Engardio, 2007; Walker and Buck, 2007), in \npart linked to re-locating polluting processes there from parts of the \u201eNorth\u201f, \nconjuring up images of the \u201cdark satanic mills\u201d of the early stages of capitalist \nindustrialisation in the UK (Thompson, 1969). By way of illustration, we can \nconsider the case of Schenzen which parallels many of the problems facing \nindustrialised towns during the industrial revolution over a century ago in the \u201eNorth\u201f. \nSchenzen is a \u201cboom town\u201d in southern China, and has been a major centre of \ncapital accumulation in the first decade of the twenty first century. It has become \nfamous for the production of toys, Christmas ornaments and artificial trees for \nwestern markets. However, there is a darker side to this growth as the health of \nworkers has been damaged due to them having to work with poisonous materials: \n  \n \u201cin the toy factories the workers have to deal with poisons every day. A lot of \nChristmas ornaments are made with special glues and many of the factories \nrefuse to pay for protective equipment\u201d (August, 2002, 11).  \n \nIn factories producing computers and related equipment in the Pearl River delta of \nChina, workers are frequently exposed to dangerous chemicals (CAFOD, 2004). \nOften workers \u2013 including those who are single young women drawn to factory \nwork from rural areas \u2013 live in accommodation that is at best basic and also \nposes threats to health and well-being (for example, see Lynch, 2007).  \n 13 \n \nn parts of both the \u201eNorth (for example, north east England, Brandenburg in \nGermany and Cape Breton in Canada) and \u201eSouth\u201f (such as Bangalore in India) \nthe proliferation of back offices, business process and call centres \u2013 the service \nsector equivalent of Taylorist manufacturing branch plants -  has brought new \nforms of risk to the health of those employed in them. These are primarily risks \nlinked to problems of mental ill-health as a result of the stress of working in \nclosely monitored environments, in which the productivity of individual workers is \nclosely monitored via sophisticated computerised algorithms and those that fail to \nmeet the required targets know only too well that they are at risk of losing their \njob in places in which others are more than willing to take them (Hudson, 2006).  \n \nSecondly, the restructuring of agriculture over parts of the \u201eSouth\u201f away from \nsubsistence-based agricultural production for domestic consumption to focus \nupon cash crop production oriented to the export markets of the \u201eNorth\u201f has \nresulted in a reduction of food for domestic consumption. This has resulted from \na restructuring of agricultural production systems away from subsistence to cash-\ncrop production, thereby moving the agricultural system away from production for \ndomestic consumption to producing a range of \u201eexotic\u201f fruits, vegetables and \nflowers for sale in the markets of the \u201eNorth\u201f and more latterly to producing crops \nas a source of bio-fuels. Often such changes have resulted from pressures from \ninternational organisations such as the World Bank and its structural adjustment \nprogrammes \u2013 and as such are coloured with a strong neo-colonial hue that \nechoes a colonial past. As a result, malnutrition, famine and starvation, already \nrife over much of the global \u201eSouth\u201f - 50% of the world\u201fs population are \nchronically malnourished and the vast majority of them are resident in the \u201eSouth\u201f \n- have been further exacerbated.  \n \nThirdly, there are increased risks to health and well-being because of loss of \nwork and worklessness, especially in parts of the \u201eNorth\u201f, as a result of the global \nflight of industrial capital. This has important effects on the mental and physical \n 14 \nhealth on those who lost their former jobs and can\u201ft get new waged work, \nincreasing the risks of new forms of ill-health. The physically demanding and \ndangerous nature of work in industries such as coal mining, steel, ship-building \nand heavy engineering meant that they, and the areas in which they were \nconcentrated, were traditionally associated with high levels of poor health arising \nfrom occupationally and industrially specific illnesses (for example, cancers and \nlung and respiratory diseases) as well as the general \u201ewear and tear\u201f on bodies \nsubjected to continuously working in strenuous jobs in difficult conditions \nreflected in musculoskeletal conditions and  industrial injuries (for example, see \nWalsh et al, 2008). This is not without irony, as old and new combine in \u201ewicked\u201f \nways. On the one hand, there are the continuing residual negative health effects \nof working in industries such as coal mining, steel and shipbuilding. Added to \nthis, living in derelict industrial landscapes, surrounded by the decaying remains \nof factories and industrial facilities on brownfield sites, has a disproportionately \ndeleterious effect on the health and well-being of local communities3. In addition, \nthe \u201elifestyle\u201f choices made in many of these areas around alcohol and tobacco \nconsumption have also compounded the deleterious effects of the wider \neconomic and social environment. On the other hand, these issues are also \noverlaid by new problems of poor health and ill-being that result from an absence \nof waged work in environments that continue to display the polluting effects of \nindustrial collapse and decay. Thus in addition to the legacy of poor physical \nhealth as a result of working, people now suffer the effects of poor mental health \nand ill-being of a lack of work and the consequences that this has for concepts of \nidentity and self-worth. This downward spiral in terms of poor health also \ngenerates considerable task demands on the healthcare system which, as a \nresult of the level of demand and the lack of tax related revenue within the area, \nmay not provide the quality of service experienced in other, more affluent areas. \n \n                                                 \n3\n Professor Paul Symes, English Partnerships, February 2008 \u2013 I am grateful to my colleagues Dr. Karen \nJohnson in the School of Engineering at Durham for this information \n 15 \nFourthly, large scale industrial development in the \u201fSouth\u201f is typically associated \nwith internal inter-regional and rural to urban migration on an unprecedented \nscale, most recently experienced in China. The result of this influx of peple is that \nthe scale of urbanisation is reaching new levels (Walker and Buck, 2007), with a \nrange of devastating consequences for the natural environment and human \nhealth. On many cases, the influx of people cannot be accommodated within \nplanned housing schemes and therefore it results in the development of shanty \n\u201etowns\u201f \u2013 with their associated problems of sanitation, poor environmental \nconditions and disease. Even where there is a well-developed planned housing \nscheme the sheer volume of people moving into urban areas becomes \nproblematic. As the urban environment becomes contaminated with a variety of \npollutants then public health is placed at risk because of booming industrial \nproduction, surging demand for electricity produced from carbon fossil fuels and \nmajor changes to lifestyle and consumption patterns, especially the growth of \nprivate car ownership. This has had widespread effects on public health as \natmospheric pollution increases and potable water supplies are threatened (most \nspectacularly in China but by no means only there: for example see Engardio, \n2007). The unwanted environmental consequences of economic growth and \nindustrialisation remain heavily localised, between and within countries: pollution is \ntime\/space specific (noting, of course, that inter-generational effects are possible), \nimpacting unevenly upon spaces in which people live and work, on their health and \nwell-being, and on death rates. \n \nFifthly, the (re-)location of \u201erisky\u201f and highly polluting plants to parts of the \u201eSouth\u201f \nand some parts of peripheries in the \u201eNorth\u201f can endanger health and well-being . \nAs the public understanding of the risks of polluting production has increased, \nthen the expressed concern about these issues has also increased which has \ngenerated particular political conflicts at the local level (see, for example, Smith \n1990, 1991). Whereas the pollutant effects of some activities (for example, \nmining) are necessarily localised, companies engaged in other activities have \ngreater freedom of locational choice. As such, they can site polluting industries in \n 16 \nspaces of least resistance \u2013 from parts of the global \u201eSouth\u201f to peripheral regions \nand inner cities in the \u201eNorth\u201f. For example, Chicago\u201fs southeast side is plagued by \nnumerous pollutant industries, commercial hazardous waste landfills and toxic \nwaste dumps. Consequently, it has one of the highest rates of incidence of cancer \nin the USA (Bullard, 1994, 279-80). In Sydney, Nova Scotia, the tar ponds - the \nlegacy of the now-closed steelworks - sit in the middle of the built up area, \nsurrounded by signs warning people to keep out. The site - \u201cthe most polluted site \nin north America\u201d (Lotz, 1998, 167) \u2013 is extremely hazardous because of high \nconcentrations of polychlorinated biphenols (PCBs). Times Beach, Missouri, was \nirreparably contaminated by dioxin, a by-product of manufacturing antiseptic \nhexachlorophene (Calton, 1989). While such events are comparatively rare they \nare not unknown in the internal peripheries of the \u201eNorth\u201f. \n \nIn sharp contrast, such events are only too common over much of the \nindustrialising cities and regions of the \u201eSouth\u201f. As popular environmental \nawareness of the risks to health of polluting industries grew in the global \u201eNorth\u201f, \nin the global \u201eSouth\u201f ruling \u00e9lites and national states unashamedly prioritised - \nand continue to prioritise - economic growth and employment over the natural \nenvironment and human health and well-being. Consequently, companies have \nbeen able to deploy dangerous working practices and polluting production \ntechnologies that are inadmissible within workplaces elsewhere. For example, in \nDecember 1984 five tons of poisonous methyl isocyanate gas leaked from the \nUnion Carbide of India Ltd pesticides plant in Bhopal, killing more than 3,000 \npeople and injuring tens of thousands (see, for example, Hazarika 1987; \nShrivastava 1987; Lapierre and Moro 2002; Smith and Sipika, 1993). By 1999 the \ndeath toll exceeded 6,0004, with substantial, and in some locations severe, pollution \nof land and drinking water supplies from heavy metals and organic contaminants. \nResidents of these areas are exposed to the risks of hazardous chemicals on a \ndaily basis.  There are many more examples of accidents at work leading to deaths, \n                                                 \n4\n The death toll from this accident has always been the subject of some debate. The tradition of \nburning the bodies soon after death, the lack of an effective census of the people living in the \nshanty towns and the impact of latent deaths have all contributed to this uncercertainty. \n 17 \nalbeit on a less dramatic scale. For example, in 2003 over 30 workers were killed \nand 140 injured in an explosion at a fireworks factory in Wangkou, north of Beijing \nin China. \n \nAn alternative to exporting polluting industries is to export their pollutants, either \ndeliberately or inadvertently into the largely unregulated global commons of the \natmosphere and oceans (German Advisory Council on Global Change, 2002). In \nother cases, waste products are exported in different forms, deliberately targeting \nselected peripheral spaces as destinations. For example, Yearley (1995) \nreported that Kassa Island, off the coast of Africa, became the recipient of highly-\npolluted incinerator ash from power stations in Philadelphia. Over a decade later, \nHouveld (2006) reported that a Greek-registered ship, chartered by a Dutch \ncompany, had discharged several hundred tons of highly toxic wastes, a \npoisonous mix of petrol wastes and cleaning agents, from its tanks at Abidjan, in \nthe Ivory Coast. The sludge was then taken away by a local company, and \ndumped at ten sites around Abidjan. This led to thousands of people being \nhospitalised and several deaths.  \n \nExport of wastes can be problematic for exporters, however, as the impacts of \npollution may return to blight the health and well-being of people living in their \nspaces of origin. For example factories re-located from the USA into the \nmaquiladora border zone in Mexico in response, inter alia, to less stringent \nenvironmental regulations there subsequently exported air pollution, sewage and \ncontaminated food back to the USA as \u201cecological havoc recognises no \nboundaries\u201d (George, 1992, 6). It is, however, important to keep a sense of \nproportion and keep the issue of pollution in its proper perspective in terms of \nhealth and well-being, Ceasing to produce all toxins, hazardous wastes and \nradio-active materials would have disastrous consequences for public health and \nthe well-being of millions of people (Harvey, 1996, 400).  Such changes would \nand should be powerfully contested. The issue therefore becomes one of debate \n 18 \nand accommodation rather than the extremes of unfettered pollution or a total \nban. \n \nFinally, the provision of health care services via the market, allied to the \nintroduction of pseudo-market criteria within the remaining public health sector, \nhas increased inequalities in access to health care and in health outcomes. This \nhas increased the risks of poor health and ill-being to many \u2013 not least refugees \nwho lack both the money to buy health care and the political rights to access it \nvia citizenship. At the same time the greatly increased scale of the movement of \npeople is increasing the risks of global pandemics of infectious diseases.  \nGrowing numbers of frequent international travellers may magnify the \ntransmission of infectious diseases such as SARS and avian flu (Commission on \nthe Macroeconomics of Health, 2001, 76). While this may be true, there are other \neffects on health and well-being as a result of the growth in international \nmigration. In many parts of Europe for example, health care systems have come to \nrely upon immigrants from other parts of the world.  The migration to Europe of \ndoctors, nurses and medical professionals from parts of Africa, the Caribbean \nand Asia is well-established, often linked to former colonial ties. The recently \ngrowing tendency for countries in the \u201eNorth\u201f selectively to use those in the \n\u201eSouth\u201f as sources of skilled labour, to meet labour shortages in critical \noccupations in health care  via immigration, has both added to and generalised \nthis pattern of migration flows. Often, therefore, these migratory movements have \nled to accusations of promoting a neo-colonial \u201cbrain drain\u201d of talented people \nfrom countries such as Egypt, India or Sri Lanka (although this is more a \nquestion of reinforcing existing trends rather than establishing wholly new ones \nas these countries have long-established roles as providers of skilled \ninternational migrant labour) but in other cases such migration of skilled health \nworkers has been promoted by states such as the Philippines as part of a \nstrategy to generate foreign currencies to pay for imports (Bach and Solomon, \n2008). In 20 African countries more than 35% of nationals with a University \neducation are living abroad (Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, 2001, \n 19 \n75-6). The migration abroad of medically trained staff is particularly problematic \nas this has a massive effect on the performance of health care systems in \n\u201eSouthern\u201f countries that are already over-burden with problems around disease \nand general public health. This registers an enduring developmental dilemma. \nWhile enabling the individuals involved to enhance their health, well-being and \nlife style and acquire more highly remunerated employment within globalised \nlabour markets for highly qualified labour, the corollary is that the origin areas \nlose people with skills that they can ill-afford to lose (not least, in health care), \nwith important developmental implications and implications for the health and \nwell-being of those who must of necessity remain in those origin areas.  \n \nThe greatest problems of ill-health and ill-being are to be found in countries with \n\u201cfailed\u201d or \u201cfragile states\u201d, with the lowest per caput GDP and incomes and often \nfurther depleted by the out-migration of qualified personnel. Nearly half of all the \nchildren who die before the age of five years are born in these \u201cfragile states\u201d, \nwith child mortality almost two and a half times higher than in other poor \ncountries. Even in cases where internal (or external) conflict as such is not an \nissue, there are key questions of questions of political and policy choices and \npriorities, which affect the distribution of health outcomes: in short, is the priority \nguns or health care? Is the priority production of flowers for export or food for \ndomestic consumption? In a situation in which a majority of the world\u201fs \npopulation are under-nourished and lack a sufficient calorie intake to reproduce \nthe body healthily, it seems odd that food production is anything other than \nnumber one priority. Are taxation and income redistributive policies progressive \nor regressive? There is evidence that some \u2013 as many as 50 - governments in \ndeveloping countries impose high tariffs and taxes on imported drugs as a way of \nraising revenue, off-setting the attempts to persuade pharmaceutical companies \nto provide drugs at lower cost to these countries and the decision by the WTO in \n2003 to allow poor countries which lacked a domestic pharmaceuticals industry \nand pharmaceuticals production capacity to arrange with  other countries to \nproduce cheap generic versions of drugs still protected by patents. As a result, \n 20 \nthe prices of drugs are driven up and many people in these countries cannot \nafford them. Equally, sales taxes on items such as food invariably serve to \nreduce food consumption amongst the poorer sections of society and thereby \nincrease their vulnerability to illness and disease (Bate et al, 2005). In short, a \nrange of economic and social policy choices have critical effects on mortality \nrates, health outcomes and the quality of life and well-being of those who survive. \n \n \nConclusions \n \nWith around half of the world\u201fs population already mal-nourished, there is no \ndoubt that many people already suffer chronic ill-health and ill-being. Many more \nare at risk of suffering even more as a result of the combined effects of changing \npolitical-economic priorities and the deliberate deepening of uneven development \nthat has been an integral part of the neo-liberal \u201eproject\u201f. The extent to which \nthere is an appreciation of the effects of neo-liberal globalisation in increasing \nrisks to public health remains much less certain. Beyond this, however, there is \nnow a growing recognition of the deleterious effects of human activities on \nclimate change and the socio-ecological system more generally and the further \nrisks that these pose to health and well-being. While there is a growing \nacknowledgment that human activity is accelerating the rate of climate change, \nand that this poses growing risks to public health, albeit unevenly distributed \nacross the globe, there is nothing resembling an effective consensus to do \nsomething radical to ameliorate the risks this poses to health and wellbeing \u2013 \nindeed survival. There is a continuing na\u00efve and, in its own way, touching belief \nthat somehow human ingenuity will prevail and a technological fix will emerge \n(largely around such issues as: safe nuclear power, carbon capture, mass \nproduced cheap renewable energy, a hydrogen-based economy, and the like), \nthereby averting the need for radical changes to economy, society and lifestyles. \nIt remains an open question as to whether such technological innovations will in \nfact emerge and even more so if they will merge in time to avoid catastrophic \n 21 \nclimatic changes. It is by no means certain, therefore, that these challenges can \nbe tackled effectively and even more so if this can be done in a timely fashion \nand in a way that increases environmental and socio-spatial justice rather than \nfurther widen the gap between those who enjoy good health and well-being and \nthose condemned to a life of ill-being, poor health and premature death on the \nmargins.   \n \nAcknowledgments \n \nThis is a revised and extended version of a paper first presented to the Risk and \nSecurity Management Forum Summer Seminar Programme, Goodwood Park \nHotel, 9-10 July.
