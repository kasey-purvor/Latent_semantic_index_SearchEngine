A comparison with previous work (PeECE II) sug-\ngests that DMS concentrations do not respond consistently to\npelagic ecosystem CO2 enrichment experiments.\n1 Introduction\nDimethylsulphide (DMS) is a volatile sulfur compound pro-\nduced from the algal secondary metabolite dimethylsulfonio-\npropionate (DMSP) by complex biotic interactions in marine\necosystems (Stefels et al., 2007). DMS is the main natural\nsource of sulfate aerosol to the atmosphere and the major\nroute by which sulfur is recycled from the ocean to the con-\ntinents. The particulate atmospheric oxidation products of\nDMS can act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby affect\nthe radiative properties of the atmosphere by reflecting solar\nradiation (Charlson et al., 1987).\nThe physiological roles of algal DMS and DMSP are not\nfully understood. DMSP is a compatible solute with mul-\ntifunctional properties that is synthesized by marine phy-\ntoplankton for osmoregulation and cellular cryoprotection\n(Stefels, 2000). DMSP and its cleavage products DMS and\nacrylate have been suggested to serve as antioxidants under\nlight or nutrient stress (Sunda et al., 2002), and to act as info-\nchemicals (Nevitt, 1995; Zimmer-Faust et al., 1996; Wolfe,\n2000; Steinke et al., 2006) or grazing deterrents (Wolfe et al.,\n1997; Strom et al., 2003).\nThe production of DMSP is strongly dependent on the\nspecies composition of the marine ecosystem under investi-\ngation. Some phytoplankton groups, such as the prymnesio-\nphytes, are prolific producers of DMSP with high DMSP\/cell\nratios (Keller et al., 1989). The prymnesiophyte coc-\ncolithophore Emiliania huxleyi also contains DMSP-lyase\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n408 M. Vogt et al.: DMSP and DMS dynamics under different CO2 conditions\nisozymes (Steinke et al., 1998) and is able to enzymati-\ncally cleave DMSP to DMS. Other prymnesiophytes such\nas Phaeocystis and dinophytes also produce high concentra-\ntions of DMSP but many other algal taxa are poor DMSP-\nproducers (Liss et al., 1994). Intracellular DMSP is re-\nleased to the water during cell lysis caused by grazing\n(Dacey and Wakeham, 1986), or due to natural mortality\nand after viral infection (Malin et al., 1998). Once in so-\nlution, DMSP can be utilized by many bacteria as a sul-\nfur, carbon or energy source via catabolic demethylation\nto 3-methylmercaptopropionate and 3-mercaptopropionate\n(Kiene and Linn, 2000; Howard et al., 2006). Bacteria have\nalso been shown to enzymatically cleave DMSP to DMS and\nacrylate (Kiene, 1993; Ledyard and Dacey, 1996; Stefels and\nDijkhuizen, 1996; Steinke and Kirst, 1996) and novel evi-\ndence suggests DMSP-dependent DMS-production without\nthe release of acrylate (Todd et al., 2007). DMS can be used\nas a metabolite by bacteria (Vila-Costa et al., 2006), photo-\nchemically degraded at the sea surface (Brimblecombe and\nShooter, 1986; Kieber et al., 1996), or transferred to the at-\nmosphere (Liss and Slater, 1974). Since several biological\ncomponents of the marine microbial food-web add to the\nphysico-chemical processes that are involved in the produc-\ntion and consumption of DMSP and DMS, the concentra-\ntions of both may be affected by changes in environmental\nconditions. Thus, DMS could serve as a sensitive indicator\nto human-induced climate change.\nOcean acidification is one of the effects of increased an-\nthropogenic CO2. In the past 200 years, the oceans have ab-\nsorbed approximately half of the CO2 emitted by human ac-\ntivities such as fossil fuel burning and cement manufacturing\n(Sabine et al., 2004). This uptake of CO2 has led to changes\nin the chemical equilibrium of the seawater and to a reduction\nof the pH of the ocean surface waters by 0.1 units. If emis-\nsions were to continue according to present trends, ocean sur-\nface pH could decrease by 0.3\u20130.5 units by the end of the\n21st century. This is equivalent to a threefold increase of the\nconcentration of H+ ions in the surface ocean (Caldeira and\nWickett, 2005). The impacts of ocean acidification on marine\norganisms and ecosystems are still poorly understood. Lab-\noratory experiments and field studies indicate that acidifica-\ntion will adversely affect calcification (Royal Society, 2005;\nKleypas et al., 2006), a process by which marine organisms\nfabricate shells and plates from calcium and carbonate ions.\nCoccolithophores, such as E. huxleyi, are one of the phyto-\nplanktonic groups expected to be strongly affected by ocean\nacidification (Riebesell et al., 2000). E. huxleyi is abundant in\ntemperate oceans and is a prolific producer of DMS (Keller et\nal., 1989; Holligan et al., 1993; Malin et al., 1993). It is pos-\nsible that the intracellular production of DMSP or its direct\nconversion to DMS by E. huxleyi DMSP-lyases is affected\nby ocean acidification. Additionally, as mentioned above,\noceanic DMS production is a result of complex interactions\nwithin the marine food-web. Consequently, ocean acidifi-\ncation may affect DMS concentrations and fluxes by alter-\ning one or more of the various pathways or impacting some\nof the species involved. Ocean acidification may therefore\naffect the feedback of DMS on climate via aerosol forma-\ntion, as described by the CLAW-hypothesis (Charlson et al.,\n1987). Previous studies (Avgoustidi, 20061; Avgoustidi et\nal., 20082) showed reduced DMS concentrations under high\nCO2 in both field and laboratory studies. If the results from\nthese studies can be extrapolated to global scales, reduced\nDMS emissions could lead to a significant positive feedback\non global warming.\nHere, we present the concentrations of DMS, DMSP and\nDMSP-lyase activities (DLA) during a mesocosm study in a\nNorwegian Fjord in May and June 2005. Our goal was to in-\nvestigate differences in DMS dynamics under elevated CO2,\nto address factors that may result in altered DMS dynamics\nand to compare our findings to results from a previous field\nexperiment (Avgoustidi et al., 20082). Furthermore, we in-\nvestigate the relevance of our results with respect to global\nclimate change and its impact on global DMS fluxes.\n2 Materials and methods\n2.1 General experimental set-up\nThe experiment was conducted at the Espeland Marine Bio-\nlogical Station, University of Bergen (Norway) in May and\nJune 2005. The set-up consisted of 9 polyethylene enclo-\nsures (ca. 25 m3, 9.5 m water depth) moored to a raft in the\nRaunefjord (60.3\u25e6 N, 5.2\u25e6 E): 3 bags with present day pCO2,\nhereafter referred to as \u201c1\u00d7CO2\u201d (350 ppmv partial pressure\nof CO2), 3 bags with double pCO2, referred to as \u201c2\u00d7CO2\u201d\ntreatments (700 ppmv) and 3 bags with triple pCO2, referred\nto as \u201c3\u00d7CO2\u201d treatments (1050 ppmv). These bags were si-\nmultaneously filled with unfiltered fjord water pumped from\na depth of 12 m. Fresh water (0.6 m3) was mixed into the up-\nper 5 m of the mesocosm bags to stratify the water column.\nThe 2\u00d7CO2 and 3\u00d7CO2 bags were aerated with CO2 en-\nriched air, until the water pCO2 reached the target values (day\n0), the 1\u00d7CO2 bags were aerated with ambient air. To allow\nbiological processes to alter water pCO2, no further adjust-\nments were carried out after day 1. All mesocosm bags were\ncovered with transparent hoods of ethylene tetrafluorethylene\nfoil (Foiltec, Bremen, Germany), which allowed transmis-\nsion of 95% of incoming light intensity for the complete solar\nspectrum. The headspaces underneath the hoods were kept\nat target pCO2 by flushing them with CO2-enriched air (23\u2013\n35 L min\u22121). A phytoplankton bloom was triggered via the\naddition of nutrients on day 0 (16 May 2005; 0.7\u00b5mol L\u22121\nPO4, 15\u00b5mol L\u22121 NO3) and the bloom was studied over a\n1 Avgoustidi, V.: Dimethyl sulphide production in a double-CO2\nworld, Ph.D. thesis, University of East Anglia, 2006.\n2 Avgoustidi, V., Joint, I., Nightingale, P.

Vogt et al.: DMSP and DMS dynamics under different CO2 conditions 409\nperiod of 24 days. Throughout the study period, the upper 5m\nof the water column were gently mixed by means of an airlift\nsystem. Further details of the set-up and procedures can be\nfound elsewhere (Engel et al., 2005; Schulz et al., 2007).\n2.2 Sampling for sulfur compounds\nSamples from all nine mesocosms were taken daily at\n10:30 h, simultaneous with other measurements conducted\nduring PeECE III. Bubble-free sampling was carried out with\nnine 5 L polyethylene aspirators. Prior to sampling, all aspi-\nrators were thoroughly rinsed first with natural fjord water\nand then with water from the respective mesocosms. The\nmouths of the aspirators were covered with a 200\u00b5m mesh\nin order to exclude mesozooplankton grazers and taps were\nleft open to release air during sampling. The aspirators were\nthen inverted and slowly immersed through the water surface\nto a depth of approximately 0.3 m. A minimum of 3 L of\nwater was sampled before closing the taps, slowly turning\nover and capping off the aspirators and transporting them to\na cold-room where the samples were stored at in situ water\ntemperature (9\u201311.5\u25e6C) and in dim light. Sub-samples were\ntaken using Teflon tubing and gas-tight syringes (20 mL) af-\nter slowly rotating the aspirators to re-suspend particulate\nmatter.\n2.3 Quantification of sulfur compounds\nParticulate DMSP (DMSPp): Slow syringe filtration was\nused to filter 5 to 20 mL of sample through 25 mm glass-\nfibre filters (Whatman GF\/F). The filtrate was directly in-\njected into a purge vessel for the analysis of DMS (see be-\nlow). Thereafter, the filters were folded and placed into\nglass vials containing NaOH, using 3 mL of 500 mmol L\u22121\nNaOH in 4 mL screw-capped vials (days 1 to 4) or 13 mL of\n500 mmol L\u22121 NaOH in 20 mL crimp-sealed vials (days 5 to\n24). The alkaline hydrolysis of DMSP resulted in equimo-\nlar quantities of DMS. Vials were sealed immediately with\nTeflon-coated septa, stored in the dark and transported to\nour laboratory at the University of East Anglia (UEA). The\nheadspace analysis of DMS resulting from DMSPp cleav-\nage commenced with a 24 h incubation of the vials at a stan-\ndard temperature of 30\u25e6C before manual injection of 50 to\n200\u00b5L of headspace for quantitative analysis of DMS using\ngas chromatography and flame-photometric detection (Shi-\nmadzu GC-2010 with 30 m\u00d70.53 mm CP-Sil 5CB capillary\ncolumn). DMS standards for calibration were prepared us-\ning commercial DMSP standard (Centre for Analysis, Spec-\ntroscopy and Synthesis (CASS), University of Groningen\nLaboratories, The Netherlands) at a final concentration of\n0.3 to 3\u00b5mol DMS L\u22121 added to vials containing 3 or\n13 mL 500 mmol L\u22121 NaOH. The detection limit for a 20 ml\nsample was about 2 nmol L\u22121 DMSP. The analytical error\nwas less than 12%, as estimated from a comparison of repli-\ncate samples (n=16).\nDMS: After filtration for DMSPp, 5 to 18 mL of the fil-\ntrate was used for DMS analysis. The analytical volumes\nfor the DMS measurements were adjusted during the course\nof the experiment to accommodate changes in concentra-\ntion. DMS measurements were conducted within 2 h of\nsampling using the gas chromatographic system described\nabove, in combination with a purge-and-trap system for cryo-\ngenic enrichment of DMS at \u2212150\u25e6C (details in Vogt et\nal. (2008) and Turner et al. (1990)). Calibrations were car-\nried out every 3\u20134 days with DMSP stock solution equivalent\nto 0.3 to 24.3 nmol L\u22121 and addition of NaOH to more than\n500 mmol L\u22121. The detection limit of the above described\ngas chromatographic system was less than 0.3 nmol L\u22121\nDMS. The analytical error was 6%, as estimated from repli-\ncate calibration standards (n=69).\nDissolved DMSP (DMSPd ): After purging the water sam-\nple for DMS analysis was completed, 4 to 13 mL of purged,\nde-gassed sample was transferred into 20 mL vials and\nbrought to a volume of 13 mL with MilliQ water for analysis\nof DMSPd . Samples were adjusted to 500 mmol L\u22121 NaOH\nby adding 684\u00b5L of 10 mol L\u22121 NaOH. Vials were immedi-\nately capped with Teflon-coated crimp seals and stored in the\ndark prior to analysis. Samples were incubated at 30\u25e6C for\n24 h before manual injection of 200\u00b5L of headspace for the\nanalysis of DMS using the gas chromatographic system de-\nscribed above. DMS concentrations were quantified via the\naddition of DMSP standard to 13 mL 500 mmol L\u22121 NaOH\nat a final concentration of 6 to 60 nmol L\u22121. Detection limit\nin 13 mL of sample was about 1.3 nmol L\u22121 DMSPd .\nTotal DMSP (DMSPt ): Because of concerns about poten-\ntial filtration artifacts (Kiene and Slezak, 2006) we also con-\nsidered total DMSP (DMSPt ) concentrations for our anal-\nyses. DMSPt was calculated as the sum of DMSPd and\nDMSPp concentrations.\nDMSP-lyase activity (DLA): Measurements of DMSP-\nlyase activity were conducted using headspace measure-\nments of DMS using the methods described in Steinke et\nal. (2000) and Steinke et al. (2007). In brief, 250 to\n300 mL of seawater was filtered through polycarbonate fil-\nters of 47 mm diameter and 2\u00b5m pore size (Whatman Nu-\nclepore). The filters were folded twice and placed into\ncryo-vials before snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen and stor-\nage at \u221280\u25e6C. DLA samples were transported on dry ice\nto our laboratory at UEA.

Diagnostic pigments were extracted according to\nDerenbach (1969). Pigment distributions were quantified us-\ning reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography\n(HPLC) analysis, using the method described in Barlow et\nal. (1997). CHEMTAX (Mackey et al., 1996) was used to\nderive the fraction of chl-a attributable to the dominant phy-\ntoplankton groups. For more information on chlorophyll-a\nmeasurements refer to Schulz et al. (2007) and Riebesell et\nal. (2007). While chlorophyll-a and pigments were not anal-\nysed in replicates during this study, the analytical error is\nestimated to lie within 10\u201315%, based on the results from\nprevious analyses.\nCounts of Emiliania huxleyi cells and other phyto-,\nbacterio- and virioplankton were conducted using a FAC-\nSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson) equipped with\nan air-cooled laser with an output power of 15 mW\nat 488 nm and a standard filter set-up. Phytoplankton\ncounts were obtained from fresh samples at high flow rate\n(ca. 100\u00b5L min\u22121). All samples were analysed during 300 s,\nand populations were discriminated based on dot plots of side\nscatter and red fluorescence. For details on the flow cytomet-\nric measurements, see Paulino et al. (2007). Heterotrophic\nbacteria and virus were detected and discriminated based on\nclusters observed in scatter plots of side scatter versus green\nfluorescence, using SYBR Green I staining and following\nthe method described in Larsen et al. (2007) and Paulino et\nal. (2007).\nThe partial pressure of CO2 was quantified as described in\nBellerby et al. (2007).\n3 Results\n3.1 DMS\nDMS concentrations for the 3 enclosures of each treatment\nand the mean DMS concentrations for the 3 treatments are\npresented in Fig. 1. Three phases can be distinguished in\nthe temporal development of DMS concentrations (Fig. 1d):\nFrom day 0 till day 10 (phase 1) DMS concentrations in-\ncreased in all treatments. At the beginning of the experi-\nment, DMS concentrations were low in all enclosures due\nto the low concentrations of DMS in the original fjord wa-\nter and possible loss of DMS during the aeration proce-\ndure. After day 0, DMS concentrations increased in all treat-\nments, with higher DMS concentrations in the 1\u00d7CO2 than\nin the 2\u00d7CO2 and 3\u00d7CO2 treatments. On day 10 the max-\nimum in DMS concentration was reached in 1\u00d7CO2, with\nan average value of 29.5 nmol L\u22121. Phase 2 (days 11\u201316)\nis characterized by a steep decline in DMS concentrations\nin 1\u00d7CO2, and constant or declining DMS concentrations\nin 2\u00d7CO2 and 3\u00d7CO2 until day 16. The abrupt, steep de-\ncline in DMS concentrations was measured consistently in\nBiogeosciences, 5, 407\u2013419, 2008 www.biogeosciences.net\/5\/407\/2008\/\nM.

In the averages of the 2\u00d7CO2 and\n3\u00d7CO2 treatments, DMS concentrations reached a plateau\nbetween day 10 and day 12, with maximum average con-\ncentrations of 27.4 nmol L\u22121 (2\u00d7CO2) and 25.3 nmol L\u22121\n(3\u00d7CO2). In comparison to the 1\u00d7CO2 treatments, the slope\nof the DMS decline was less steep in the 2\u00d7CO2 and 3\u00d7CO2\ntreatments. On day 16, DMS concentrations were below\n6 nmol L\u22121 in all treatments. Phase 3 (days 17\u201322) is char-\nacterised by the onset of a smaller bloom of Synechococcus\nand dinoflagellates, which lead to a small increase in DMS\nconcentrations in all treatments.\nA two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with log trans-\nformed data for the 3 treatments showed that the tempo-\nral development of DMS between the 3 treatments was\nsignificantly different (Fig. 1d; F=8.157, df =2, \u03c3<0.001,\np=0.05)3. A posteriori testing with a Bonferroni test showed\nsignificant differences between the 1\u00d7CO2 and 2\u00d7CO2\ntreatments (\u03c3<0.001, p=0.05). The significance of the differ-\nence between 1\u00d7CO2 and 3\u00d7CO2 (\u03c3=0.063, p=0.05) proved\ninconclusive and the difference between 2\u00d7CO2 and 3\u00d7CO2\n(\u03c3=0.192, p=0.05) was not significant at the 95% confidence\nlevel.\nThe calculation of time integrated averages of DMS (days\n0\u201322) showed that over the whole duration of the experi-\nment, 25% more DMS was produced in 3\u00d7CO2 and 14%\n3 F = ratio of mean squares, df = degrees of freedom, \u03c3 = sig-\nnificance of F-test and p = level of confidence.\nmore DMS in 2\u00d7CO2 than in 1\u00d7CO2 in absolute terms. Us-\ning ANOVA, however, we did not find sufficient evidence to\nsupport that these differences in integrated DMS concentra-\ntions were significant (F=1.799, df =2, \u03c3=0.244, p=0.05) at\nthe 95% confidence level. This is due to the small sample\nsize and a considerable spread in the means for each of the\nthree treatments.\n3.2 DMSPp, DMSPd , DMSPt\nThe differences in DMS concentrations between present and\nenhanced pCO2 treatments were not reflected in the particu-\nlate DMSP concentrations (Fig. 2a). This was also true for\nthe dissolved fraction (Fig. 2b) and for total DMSP (Fig. 2c).\nAs all enclosures showed very similar concentration pat-\nterns, we only show the mean concentrations for each treat-\nment. At the beginning of the experiment, DMSPp con-\ncentrations were below 50 nmol L\u22121 in all treatments. After\nday 4, DMSPp rapidly increased in all treatments, and was\nmaximal on day 10 in 1\u00d7CO2 (366 nmol L\u22121) and 2\u00d7CO2\n(370 nmol L\u22121) and on day 12 in 3\u00d7CO2 (415 nmol L\u22121).\nThereafter, DMSPp declined in all treatments. DMSPd con-\ncentrations remained constant at around 20 nmol L\u22121 until\nday 8 of the experiment, when it increased for all treat-\nments. DMSPd concentrations peaked on day 12 in 1\u00d7CO2\n(86 nmol L\u22121), on day 14 in 2\u00d7CO2 (72 nmol L\u22121) and on\nday 13 in 3\u00d7CO2 (96 nmol L\u22121), whereafter DMSPd de-\ncreased in all treatments.

In the 3\u00d7CO2 treatments,\nDMSPt concentrations showed a brief increase and reached\na maximal average concentration of 493 nmol L\u22121 on day 13\nbefore declining.\n3.3 DMSP-lyase activity\nThe measured DMSP-lyase activity (DLA) was comprised of\nthe activity of DMSP-lyase from algae and attached bacteria\nand has been analyzed without replication for each treatment\n(Fig. 2d). Due to our choice of filter (pore size of 2\u00b5m),\nthe potential contribution of many non-attached bacteria to\nDMSP-lyase activity was not included. We show data from\nmesocosm bags 2 (3\u00d7CO2), 5 (2\u00d7CO2), and 8 (1\u00d7CO2),\nbecause most other measured parameters from collaborat-\ning groups are available for these bags. DLA peaked on\nday 6 for the present (4354 nmol L\u22121 h\u22121), and on day 8\nfor 2\u00d7CO2 and 3\u00d7CO2 treatments with values of 5116 and\n3801 nmol L\u22121 h\u22121, respectively. After day 8, DLA de-\ncreased gradually in all treatments, until a minimum in ac-\ntivity was reached in all bags on day 15. After day 18,\nDLA increased rapidly in all treatments and reached a second\nmaximum on day 20, with 4952 nmol L\u22121 h\u22121 for 1\u00d7CO2,\n2590 nmol L\u22121 h\u22121 for 2\u00d7CO2 and 3849 nmol L\u22121 h\u22121 for\n3\u00d7CO2 treatments.\n3.4 Ecosystem composition\nAll bags showed similar chl-a concentrations (Fig. 3a), with\nchl-a being slightly lower in 1\u00d7CO2 than in 2\u00d7CO2 and\n3\u00d7CO2. The maximum of average chl-a occurred on day\n10 in all treatments. A succession of different phytoplankton\ntaxa occurred during the course of the experiment (Riebesell\net al., 2007). Between days 6 and 10, when most of the DMS\nwas accumulated, the bloom was dominated by diatoms and\nprymnesiophytes, including lithed E. huxleyi cells (Fig. 3b).\nDuring the whole study period, prasinophytes contributed up\nto 20% to total chl-a. Towards the end of the bloom, af-\nter day 18, dinoflagellate and Synechococcus species con-\ntributed significantly to total chlorophyll (Riebesell et al.,\n2007). A similar succession of species was observed in all\ntreatments.\n3.5 Contribution of the dominant phytoplankton groups to\nmeasured DMSPp\nWe used HPLC pigment data (in \u00b5g chl-a L\u22121) and flow cy-\ntometry data (cells L\u22121) in combination with literature val-\nues for the DMSP cell\u22121 and chl-a cell\u22121 or chl-a carbon\u22121\nof representative species of the dominant phytoplankton\ngroups including prymnesiophytes, diatoms and dinoflagel-\nlates (Bucciarelli and Sunda, 2003; Buitenhuis et al., 1999;\nGeider et al., 1997; Keller et al., 1989; Steinke et al., 1998).\nThis assessment provides a rough estimate of sources of\nDMSP in our experiment. Our findings suggest that over the\nduration of the experiment (days 0\u201322) approximately 11%\nof DMSP was produced by E. huxleyi, 20% by other prymne-\nsiophytes, 22% by diatoms and 2% by dinoflagellates. This\nsuggests that other taxa of prymnesiophytes may have con-\ntributed significantly to total DMSPp. Prymnesiophytes and\ndiatoms produced the majority of DMSP during phases 1\nand 2, whereas dinoflagellates were important DMSP pro-\nducers in phase 3. Because the uncertainty in the DMSPp\nmeasurements was estimated to amount up to 12%, which\nis of the order of the detected DMS concentrations, it is un-\nlikely that differences in DMS concentrations are reflected in\nour DMSPt measurements. Thus, we cannot exclude small\ndifferences in the phytoplanktonic DMSPp production to ac-\ncount for differences in DMS concentrations.\nBiogeosciences, 5, 407\u2013419, 2008 www.biogeosciences.net\/5\/407\/2008\/\nM.

As a general trend, DMS, DMSPt and\nchl-a tended to be more closely correlated in 2\u00d7CO2 and\n3\u00d7CO2 than in 1\u00d7CO2. DMSPt and chl-a were tempo-\nrally correlated in all 3 treatments and over the whole du-\nration of the experiment (n =16; 1\u00d7CO2: rs=0.84, 2\u00d7CO2:\nrs=0.92, 3\u00d7CO2: rs=0.86). DMS and chl-a were tempo-\nrally correlated in all treatments (n=16; 1\u00d7CO2: rs = 0.82,\n2\u00d7CO2: rs=0.91, 3\u00d7CO2: rs=0.89), as were DMS and\nDMSPt (n=19; 1\u00d7CO2: rs=0.80, 2\u00d7CO2: rs=0.98, 3\u00d7CO2:\nrs=0.94). The lower correlations in 1\u00d7CO2 in the latter two\ncases are due to the steep decline of DMS concentrations in\n1\u00d7CO2 after day 10. The high correlations of DMS, DMSPt\nand chl-a point at a tight temporal coupling of these pa-\nrameters; indeed there was only a small (1\u20132 days, 2\u00d7CO2,\n3\u00d7CO2) or no phase lag (1\u00d7CO2) between the peaks of these\n3 compounds for all 3 treatments.\nDLA was correlated with both DMS (n=19; 1\u00d7CO2:\nrs=0.68, 2\u00d7CO2: rs=0.80, 3\u00d7CO2: rs=0.72) and to a\nlesser extent with DMSPt (n=19; 1\u00d7CO2: rs=0.49, 2\u00d7CO2:\n(a)\n0.00\n0.03\n0.06\n0.09\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\nDay of Experiment\nD\nM\nS \nD\nM\nSP\nt-1\n \n[re\nl. \nn\no\n.] 3xCO22xCO2\n1xCO2\n(b)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\nDay of Experiment\nD\nM\nSP\nt c\nhl\n-\na\n-\n1  \n[nm\no\nl \u00b5\ng-\n1 ]\n(c)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\nDay of Experiment\nD\nM\nS \nch\nl-a\n-\n1  \n[nm\no\nl \u00b5\ng-\n1 ]\nFig. 4.

During phase 1, the ratio of DMS to DMSPt\nfollowed a very similar trend for all treatments (Fig. 4a).\nFrom day 10\u201316 there was a phase lag between the peaks\nof DMS and DMSPt , manifested in the divergence between\nthe 2\u00d7CO2, 3\u00d7CO2 and 1\u00d7CO2 curves. During the whole\nexperiment, there were no significant differences between\ntreatments in the ratio of DMSPt to chl-a (Fig. 4b). This\nsimilar temporal development indicates that there were no\nmajor shifts in ecosystem composition that affected DMSP\nproduction and could have resulted in the differences in DMS\nconcentrations between the 3 treatments. The ratio between\nDMS and chl-a shows significant differences between the\ntreatments (Fig. 4c). In phase 1 of the experiment DMS\nand chl-a concentrations co-varied for all 3 treatments. Dur-\ning phase 2, significantly more DMS per chl-a was accumu-\nlated in the perturbed treatments, comparable to what was\nobserved for DMS and DMSPt .\nwww.biogeosciences.net\/5\/407\/2008\/ Biogeosciences, 5, 407\u2013419, 2008\n414 M.

DMS and E. huxleyi cell numbers showed a lag of\nca. 2 days between their respective peaks for all 3 treatments.\nFurthermore, DMS correlated with total nanophytoplankton\nabundance (Table 1), which we defined to be the sum of E.\nhuxleyi, and the abundance of two different nanophytoplank-\nton groups, as determined by flow cytometry (Paulino et al.,\n2007).\nDuring phase 1, DLA correlated well with dinoflagellate\nabundances, but correlations throughout the whole duration\nof the experiment were significant only in 1\u00d7CO2 (rs=0.57).\nDuring phase 3 DLA was linearly related to dinoflagellate\nabundances, with high R2 values (n =4, 1\u00d7CO2: R2=0.97,\n2\u00d7CO2: R2=0.93, 3\u00d7CO2: R2=0.88). Only in 2\u00d7CO2 did\nDLA correlate significantly with the abundance of total bac-\nteria (Allgaier et al., 2008). DLA did not correlate signif-\nicantly with any of the biological rate measurements, such\nas primary production (Egge et al., 2007), bacterial protein\nproduction (BPP) or cell specific BPP (Allgaier et al., 2008).\n4 Discussion\nSeveral previous mesocosm studies conducted at the same\nfacility in Bergen report DMSP, DMS and chl-a concentra-\ntions under present CO2 (Levasseur et al., 1996; Williams\nand Egge, 1998; Wilson et al., 1998; Steinke et al., 2007).\nThe DMSP and DMS concentrations we found are within the\nrange of concentrations found in previous mesocosm studies,\nbut concentrations vary with respect to the boundary condi-\ntions of the experiments, i.e. they depend on the organisms\ndominating the bloom and the manipulations under which the\nsystem was investigated. The species composition reported\nfrom this experiment is typical for waters in the investigated\nregion and the time of the year. However, temperature and\nlight intensities were unusually low for May, which could\nhave influenced the bloom development and species succes-\nsion (Schulz et al., 2007).\nIn contrast to a previous CO2 enrichment study (Engel et\nal., 2005) conducted under very similar experimental con-\nditions, only few biological parameters showed CO2-related\neffects: Neither HPLC pigment analyses nor flow cytome-\ntry detected significant phytoplankton species shifts between\ntreatments. The ecosystem composition, bacterial and phyto-\nplankton abundances and productivity, grazing rates and total\ngrazer abundance and reproduction were not significantly af-\nfected by CO2 induced effects (Riebesell et al., 2007; Riebe-\nsell et al., 2008; Egge et al., 2007; Paulino et al., 2007;\nLarsen et al., 2007; Suffrian et al., 2008; Carotenuto et al.,\n2007). This finding suggests that the system under study was\nsurprisingly resilient to abrupt and large pH changes.\n4.1 DMSP and DMS\nThe resilience of the system is well reflected in the suite of\nmarine biogenic sulphur compounds. There were no differ-\nences in DMSPp, DMSPd , DMSPt or DLA and only small\ndifferences in the temporal development of DMS. These dif-\nferences in DMS concentrations may be due to several fac-\ntors, as discussed below:\nPrymnesiophytes such as E. huxleyi are high DMS produc-\ners and some have been found to be affected by ocean acid-\nification (Riebesell, 2004). Furthermore, prymnesiophytes\ndominated the phytoplankton bloom in this experiment and\npossibly were important players in the production of DMSP\nand DMS during this experiment. DMS and DMSP corre-\nlated strongly with total prymnesiophyte chl-a in all treat-\nments, in particular for the 2\u00d7CO2 and 3\u00d7CO2 treatments\n(Table 1). DMS and DMSP also correlated well with E. hux-\nleyi, particularly in the 1\u00d7CO2 treatment (Table 1). This\nfinding, along with the fact that significantly more DMSP\nwas produced by all prymnesiophytes than by E. huxleyi\npoints at the presence of other, DMSP-producing prymne-\nsiophyte species unidentified by HPLC analysis or flow cy-\ntometry during this experiment.\nWhile there were no direct observations of prymnesio-\nphytes other than E. huxleyi at the species level, indirect ob-\nservations suggest the presence of at least one other prym-\nnesiophyte: Larsen et al. (2007) found evidence for the\npresence of a viruses identified as CeV, a virus infecting\nthe prymnesiophyte Chrysochromulina ericina. The genus\nChrysochromulina can produce DMSP, with a DMSP cell\nquota 4\u00d7 as high as the one for E. huxleyi (Keller et al.,\n1989). In addition, Chrysochromulina species have been ob-\nserved in the North Sea and in Norwegian coastal waters (e.g.\nBrussaard et al., 1996). Viral infection can lead to signifi-\ncant production of DMS (Malin et al., 1998) and viral infec-\ntion is likely to have played an important role in terminating\nthe bloom during this experiment. Furthermore, Larsen et\nal. (2007) found a CO2 effect on the abundance of a group of\nhigh fluorescence viruses (HFV) identified by flow cytome-\ntry. HFV was suggested to be a composite group of several\ndsDNA viruses infecting nanoeukaryotic algae and is likely\nto have included CeV. From day 5, HFV was more abun-\ndant in 1\u00d7CO2 than in the CO2-enriched treatments. During\ndays 15\u201322, HFV was ca. 1.7\u00d7more abundant in the 1\u00d7CO2\ntreatments than in 2\u00d7CO2 and ca. 2.4\u00d7 more abundant in\n1\u00d7CO2 than 3\u00d7CO2. C. ericina has been shown to grow op-\ntimally for a pH ranging from 7.5 to 8.4 (Rhodes and Burke,\n1996) and may not have been affected as much as the calcify-\ning E. huxleyi by the pH encountered during this experiment.\nBiogeosciences, 5, 407\u2013419, 2008 www.biogeosciences.net\/5\/407\/2008\/\nM. Vogt et al.: DMSP and DMS dynamics under different CO2 conditions 415\nDifferences in viral infection of C. ericina, however, could\npotentially explain parts of the observed differences in DMS\nconcentration.\nObserved small differences in E. huxleyi cell numbers (see\nFig. 3b) could only partly account for the differences in DMS\nconcentrations between the treatments. While flow cytome-\ntry determines the number of lithed E. huxleyi cells, unlithed\nE. huxleyi cells are measured as part of the other nanophy-\ntoplankton groups. Changes in the fraction of unlithed or\n\u201cnaked\u201d E. huxleyi could account for changes in DMS. How-\never, the fraction of unlithed cells is expected to be small and\nconstant (A. Paulino, personal communication).\nEven though we could exclude major shifts in ecosystem\ncomposition (Paulino et al., 2007; Larsen et al., 2007) to ac-\ncount for the differences in DMS, the effect of smaller shifts\nin species succession could not be studied with our measure-\nments. Additionally, changes in algal physiology leading to\naltered DMS exudation rates or changes in DMSP cell quota\nof individual taxa were not studied.\nDuring the course of the experiment a statistically signifi-\ncant difference in the community structure of free-living bac-\nteria (0.2\u20135.0\u00b5m fraction) was detected for the three differ-\nent treatments (Allgaier et al., 2008). Denaturing Gradient\nGel Electrophoresis (DGGE) band pattern analysis showed\nthat while the populations of the 1\u00d7CO2 and 2\u00d7CO2 treat-\nments were similar to the fjord population, the free-living\nbacterial communities of the 3\u00d7CO2 treatments diverged\nmuch more from the original population. Despite these clear\ndifferences in bacterial community structure, the DMS con-\ncentration patterns of 3\u00d7CO2 and 2\u00d7CO2 were very similar.\nCurrently, there is no quantitative evidence for an effect of\npCO2 on bacteria that degrade DMS or DMSP, but such an\neffect could lead to different DMSP or DMS consumption\nrates or to a different microbial DMS yield from DMSP, re-\nsulting in differences in DMS concentration patterns. The\ncommunity structure of attached bacteria (>5.0\u00b5m) did not\nexhibit statistical differences between the treatments.\nTaken together, processes related to bacterial and viral ac-\ntivities may explain part of the difference in amount and tem-\nporal structure of DMS that we observed.\n4.2 DLA\nIn general, DLA was considerably higher than previous mea-\nsurements in E. huxleyi dominated waters in the North At-\nlantic and North Sea (Steinke et al., 2002a, b) and in a meso-\ncosm experiment in 2003 (Steinke et al., 2007). No clear\ndifference between the CO2 treatments was observed. DLA\ncorrelated well with dinoflagellate and prymnesiophyte chl-\na during phase 1. Hence, it is likely that phytoplanktonic\nDMSP-lyase contributed to DMS production during phase\n1. Coccolithophores such as E. huxleyi contain the enzyme\nDMSP-lyase and they dominated the bloom during days 1\u2013\n10. Except for the 2\u00d7CO2 treatment during days 0\u201310\n(rs=0.82), we did not find significant temporal correlations\nbetween DLA and E. huxleyi abundances. To our knowl-\nedge there is no published work investigating DMSP-lyase\nactivity in C. ericina. In the beginning of the experiment, di-\nnoflagellate chlorophyll levels were low, but at the end of the\nbloom (day 18 to day 22), a dinoflagellate bloom occurred\nin the mesocosms (Riebesell et al., 2007). Some dinoflagel-\nlates contain high amounts of DMSPp per cell and can show\nhigh DMSP-lyase activity. The beginning of their bloom\ncoincided well with the second increase in DLA after day\n18. We found a significant linear correlation between DLA\nand dinoflagellates during phase 3 of the experiment, hence\nsome of the DMSP-lyase activity detected in this phase of the\nbloom could be due to the increasing abundance of dinoflag-\nellates. DLA did not correlate with any of the small phyto-\nplankton groups, nor with most bacterial parameters. Only in\n2\u00d7CO2 did DLA (anti-)correlate with bacterial abundance.\nUnfortunately, we cannot yet assess the importance of al-\ngal DLA for overall DMS accumulation in this study. DLA\ncorrelated much stronger and more consistently with DMS\nand DMSPt than with any of the phyto- and bacterioplank-\nton parameters.\n4.3 Comparison with other DMS measurements during\nPeECE III\nSeveral groups measured DMS during PeECE III. Air con-\ncentrations of DMS were in phase with our observed water\nmeasurements (Sinha et al., 2007; Wingenter et al., 2007)\nand there was a good general agreement between the water\nmeasurements (Vogt et al., 2008; Wingenter et al., 2007).\nWhile we find our absolute values for the integrated DMS\nmean concentrations to be very similar to those reported in\nWingenter et al. (2007), we cannot confirm the conclusions\nof these authors that the differences were statistically signif-\nicant. This discrepancy does not arise at the data level, but\nthrough the use of different statistical procedures for the in-\nterpretation of the results: Firstly, these authors report their\ndifferences to be statistically significant at the 80% and 90%\nconfidence level, levels at which the significance of differ-\nences is generally rejected (Cowles and Davis, 1982 and ref-\nerences therein). Secondly, Wingenter et al. (2007) com-\npare the means of 3 populations in pairs of 2 with respect\nto a fixed factor (CO2) using a Student\u2019s t-test, which in-\ncreases the probability of committing type I errors, i.e. the\nnull hypothesis (no differences between populations) is re-\njected when in fact it is true (see e.g. Zar, 1999). We use\nOne-way ANOVA, known to decrease the probability of type\nI errors and decided to adopt a more stringent significance\ncriterion.\n4.4 Comparison between PeECE II and PeECE III\nIn 2003, Avgoustidi et al. studied DMS dynamics during a\nmesocosm bloom (PeECE II) under present, pre-industrial\nand future CO2 conditions (Avgoustidi et al., 20082). The\nwww.biogeosciences.net\/5\/407\/2008\/ Biogeosciences, 5, 407\u2013419, 2008\n416 M. Vogt et al.: DMSP and DMS dynamics under different CO2 conditions\nexperimental set-up and treatment of the mesocosms was\nsimilar in both Avgoustidi et al. and our study (Engel et\nal., 2005). Despite this, chl-a concentrations were approx-\nimately 3 times higher in the present study. Furthermore,\nour maximum DMSPp values (data not shown) were approx-\nimately 2 times higher than those reported in Avgoustidi et\nal. Maximal DMS values were similar in both experiments,\nbut the temporal development of the sulfur compounds was\ndifferent. Whereas DMS, DMSPp and chl-a were tightly\ncoupled in the present study, the DMS peaks show a distinct\nlag behind the DMSPp peaks in Avgoustidi et al. Hence,\na major difference between the two experiments is the tem-\nporal yield of DMS from DMSP. Avgoustidi et al. found\na significant decrease in DMS concentrations for treatments\nwith elevated pCO2. Despite the clear differences in the tem-\nporal dynamics of DMS concentrations, our results do not\nconfirm the findings by Avgoustidi et al. when integrated\nover the whole duration of the experiment, but do when inte-\ngrated up to day 12. This may partly be explained by differ-\nences in E. huxleyi cell number between the two experiments.\nWhile E. huxleyi cell numbers in our study were low (max.\n5\u00d7106 cells mL\u22121), cell numbers in Avgoustidi\u2019s experiment\nwere considerably higher (up to 56\u00d7106 cells mL\u22121). Both\nnumber densities are well within the natural range of cell\nnumbers found for E. huxleyi in the open ocean (J. Egge,\npersonal communication).\nThe behavior of DMS concentration patterns between per-\nturbed and unperturbed treatments agreed for both studies\nduring the exponential growth phase (days 0\u201310), but di-\nverged for the post-bloom phase (days 11\u201322). Although\npoorly understood at present, changes in physiology could\naccount for the reduced DMS production in 2\u00d7CO2 and\n3\u00d7CO2 during the E. huxleyi bloom until day 10 in this study.\nHad the cell number been ten-fold, as in Avgoustidi et al., this\neffect might have been amplified and the results may have\nbeen more similar. Additional processes, including bacte-\nrial uptake and catabolism of DMSP, could have influenced\nthe DMS dynamics after day 12 when the E. huxleyi bloom\ncollapsed. DMS emissions by prymnesiophyte species other\nthan E. huxleyi (such as Chrysochromulina ericina) may have\ncontributed to the prolonged peak in the perturbed treat-\nments. However, lack of data on the bacterial cycling of\nDMSP and DMS under various pCO2 conditions precludes\na full assessment of DMS dynamics during the second phase\nof the present experiment.\n4.5 DMS and ocean acidification\nThe implications of our findings for the future global ocean\nand climate are still unclear. Firstly, the changes in pCO2\nstudied here have been triggered abruptly from present values\non day 0 to double and triple concentrations on day 2, without\nallowing the systems under study to fully acclimate or adapt.\nFuture ocean acidification will proceed at a much slower\nrate and this temporal scale difference could potentially al-\nleviate the consequences of ocean acidification. Secondly,\nblooms of the magnitude we observed in this mesocosm\nstudy in terms of chlorophyll-a are rare in the open ocean.\nDMSPt concentrations of 300\u2013500 nmol L\u22121 and DMS con-\ncentrations of 40 nmol L\u22121 are untypical in the open ocean,\nwhere the 95 percentile of all measured DMS concentration\nis below 5 nmol L\u22121 (Kettle and Andreae, 2000). As the re-\ngions where DMS fluxes are most important are remote re-\ngions such as the Southern Ocean where chlorophyll is sig-\nnificantly lower, we cannot extrapolate our results to global\nscales at this point. Thirdly, mesocosms do not seem to re-\nspond in a consistent way to manipulations such as in CO2\nenrichment studies. We cannot confirm the finding of previ-\nous studies (Avgoustidi et al., 20082) that DMS accumulation\nwas significantly reduced under simulated seawater acidifi-\ncation. However, DMS concentrations varied between treat-\nments in both studies. In particular, DMS proved to be one\nof the few measured parameters that had a clear response to\nthe CO2 perturbation in this mesocosm study.\n5 Summary and conclusion\nWe studied DMS, DMSPp and DMSPd dynamics under 3\ndifferent pCO2 conditions during a mesocosm experiment in\nNorway. There were no statistically significant differences in\nthe temporal development of DMSPt , DMSPp and DMSPd\nconcentrations and in DLA, which hints at a certain resilience\nof the studied system to changes in pCO2. However, we\nfound differences in the temporal development of DMS con-\ncentrations. While DMS stayed elevated in the treatments\nwith elevated pCO2, we observed a steep decline in DMS\nconcentration in the treatment with low pCO2. As the ra-\ntio of DMS to DMSP varied strongly between treatments,\nbut DMSP per chl-a did not, we hypothesize that the ob-\nserved differences result from differences in DMS produc-\ntion or degradation mechanisms rather than from large shifts\nin community structure. Observed differences in bacterial\ncommunity structure and viral abundances may play a role,\nbut other mechanisms such as differences in exudation rates\netc. cannot be excluded.\nIt is too early to draw conclusions regarding the impor-\ntance of ocean acidification on the global sulphur cycle. This\nis only the third report that we are aware of that addresses\nchanges in DMS dynamics under future CO2 scenarios. As\nsome marine trace gases appear to be sensitive to CO2 en-\nrichments (Wingenter et al., 2007) there is a need for further\nstudies on the impact of ocean acidification on the produc-\ntion of climate-relevant gases such as DMS. Future studies\nshould be conducted under open ocean conditions using for\nexample free-floating mesocosms, should focus on rate mea-\nsurements as well as concentrations, and must include esti-\nmations of bacterial DMSP consumption rates in combina-\ntion with detailed analyses of the cellular DMSP quota of\nalgal taxa present in the investigated habitat. Only then will\nBiogeosciences, 5, 407\u2013419, 2008 www.biogeosciences.net\/5\/407\/2008\/\nM.
