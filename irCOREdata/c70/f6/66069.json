There has \nbeen considerable public debate about their effectiveness and appropriateness. What evidence is there \nabout the effects of these programmes on employment outcomes? This paper adapts the methodology \nof systematic review to inform the evidence-base for welfare to work as it applies to people with a \ndisability or a chronic illness in the UK. Quantitative and qualitative studies of welfare to work \nprogrammes directed at people with a disability or a chronic illness were identified using electronic \ndatabases, hand searches of the relevant literature, searches of the world wide web, citation follow-up, \nand contacts with authors. 5399 abstracts were identified and 16 studies were included and critically \nappraised. Overall, there is evidence that each of the five main welfare to work strategies operating in \nthe UK in the 1990s helped people with disabilities into work who were previously on benefits.  The \nproportion of participants gaining employment after involvement in one or other of the schemes ranged \nfrom 11% to 50%, and was dependent on a number of factors, including the age, type of disability and \n\u201cjob-readiness\u201d of participants, as well as the wider labour market and social security context. \nHowever, as the majority of the studies were uncontrolled, it was difficult to determine if the improved \nemployment chances were due to the effectiveness of the welfare to work interventions themselves or \nattributable to external factors, such as general upward labour market trends. The qualitative \ncomponents of the studies identified barriers and facilitators concerned with the effective \nimplementation of the schemes, which should aid design of future initiatives.  \n \nKey words: Systematic review, Disability, Chronic illness, Employment, Welfare reform. \n 3 \nIntroduction \nIn the UK, disability and chronic illness are associated with poverty and social exclusion (Acheson, \nBarker, Chambers, Graham, Marmot, & Whitehead, 1998; Bartley & Lewis, 2002; Burstrom, \nWhitehead, Lindholm & Diderichsen, 2000; Davy Smith, Bartley, & Blane, 1990; Oliver & Barnes, \n1998; Oppenheim & Harker, 1996). This is largely because work is one of the main sources of income \nin the UK and people with disabilities and chronic illnesses have disproportionately low employment \nrates: the current employment rate for people with disabilities is 49%, compared with 81% for those \nwithout (ONS, 2003a). There are 2.7 million people with a disability or a chronic illness who are on \nstate benefits (DWP, 2003a). This is the largest group of benefit claimants, accounting for around 25% \nof all benefit expenditure (the unemployed account for 10% and lone parents 11%) (ONS, 2003a). \nMany people with a disability or chronic illness are out of work for long periods of time (around one \nthird of incapacity-related benefit claims last over 5 years). They therefore face a number of barriers to \nentering employment, not least lack of experience, or skills, discrimination from employers, problems \nwith physical access to work, loss of benefit entitlement, or concerns over pay, hours and conditions \n(Gardiner, 1997). \n \nTraditionally, public policy in the UK towards increasing the employment of people with a disability or \na chronic illness has been fairly ambivalent (Floyd & Curtis, 2000). The Disabled Persons Employment \nAct of 1944 set up specialist employment facilities (such as Remploy), rehabilitation services, and the \npost-war employment quota. The measures incorporated in this act were supplemented in the 1970s \nwith a number of specialised out-of-work cash benefits such as invalidity benefit (1971) and mobility \nallowance (1975). Over the last few years (see Web figure A) there has been a significant policy shift \nas the 1995 Disability Discrimination Act abolished the post-war quota system and introduced a more \n\u201erights based\u201f approach to disability (Oliver & Barnes, 1998). Furthermore, employment measures such \nas the 1997 New Deal for Disabled People have put people with disabilities at the centre of the current \nUK government\u201fs \u201ewelfare to work\u201f strategy (Blair, 2002). This policy change has been in response to \nboth Treasury concerns with the rising costs of incapacity related benefits - around \u00a316 billion per \nannum - and calls from the disability movement for measures to tackle poverty and exclusion (Barnes, \n1991; Disability-Alliance, 1991; Treasury, 1998; DWP, 2003a). \n \n 4 \nThe phrase \u201ewelfare to work\u201f refers to a range of policy interventions that are designed to enable and \nenhance the transition from out-of-work benefit receipt to paid employment; and have become a central \npart of the present government\u201fs on-going employment strategy (Blair, 2002; Treasury, 2003). \nConceptually there have been 5 types of welfare to work strategy aimed specifically at increasing the \nlabour market participation rates of people with a chronic illness or a disability (see figure 1): \neducation, training and work placements; vocational advice and support services; in-work benefits; \nincentives for employers; and improving physical accessibility. \n \nWelfare to work is therefore an important, well-resourced and salient public policy area, yet the \nevidence base relating to the effectiveness of the various programmes in terms of increasing \nemployment chances of participants is both diffuse and incomplete. In order to increase understanding \nof the effectiveness of welfare to work for people with a disability or chronic illness, both in terms of \nits overall impact as a set of strategies and in respect of the different constituent schemes, a systematic \nreview of the relevant UK literature was conducted. This aimed to locate, analyse, and synthesise all \nempirical studies that included the assessment of the employment outcomes of welfare to work \nprogrammes directed at people with a disability or chronic illness in their evaluation. \n \nThe main welfare to work strategies \nThe main welfare to work strategies are directed at either the individual or the work environment. \nThree of the strategies focus on the individuals with a disability or chronic illness - by aiming to raise \ntheir education and vocational skills levels, providing support and advice in locating and obtaining \nwork, or overcoming financial concerns about the benefits to work transition. The other two strategies \nconcentrate on the work environment: by providing incentives to employers to employ people with a \nchronic illness or a disability, and by improving access to work via physical modifications to the \nworkplace environment (see figure 1). \n \nEducation, training and work placements \nEducation, training and work placement schemes aim to increase employment rates by providing \nvocational skills (e.g. Work Preparation Scheme), work experience and exposure to employers (e.g. \nNew Deal Innovative Schemes), or recognised qualifications (e.g. Residential Training).  Benefit \n 5 \nclaimants with a disability or chronic illness are also able to access other mainstream employment \nservices training programmes, such as Work Based Training and courses at local further education \ncolleges.  \n \nVocational advice and support services \nSome services are designed to help movement into employment by enhancing job search skills, \nmatching individuals to jobs, arranging access to training and education schemes, offering information \nabout in-work benefits, and providing other forms of individualised vocational advice and support. \nPeople with a disability or chronic illness have access to both general employment services such as Job \nCentre Plus and a number of more specialised services such as Disability Service Teams that offer \nhigher levels of vocational support such as arranging placements with employers.  \n \nIn-work benefits \nIn-work benefits aim to increase employment by overcoming fears on the part of disabled or \nchronically ill people themselves about taking low paid jobs (e.g. Tax Credits), the loss of future \nbenefit entitlement if they become out of work again (e.g. 52-week Linking Rule), the additional costs \nof employment such as transport costs (e.g. Travel to Work allowance), or the financial difficulties that \nthe initial loss of benefits could create (e.g. Job Finder\u201fs Grant or Back to Work Bonus).  \n \nIncentives for employers \nIncentives directed at employers aim to encourage recruitment by offering wage subsidies to cover the \ninitial costs of employment (Job Introduction Scheme, Work Trial). This allows time for employers to \nassess the suitability of the applicant at no cost to their firm and is designed to break down barriers of \nuncertainty about workplace abilities.  \n \nAccessibility \nAccessibility interventions are designed to facilitate employment take up and job retention by reducing \nthe physical workplace barriers, such as the need for specialist equipment, which people with \ndisabilities or chronic illnesses may face. Currently, the main initiative in this area is the Department of \nWork and Pension\u201fs Access to Work scheme.  \n 6 \n \nWe carried out a systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of interventions falling into \nthese 5 main conceptual categories. Legislation in the form of the Disability Discrimination Act (1995) \nis a further strategy to influence the working lives of people with disabilities. It is not, however, a \nstrategy specifically designed to help disabled people into work from welfare benefits, but rather a \nmeasure to help employees remain in work by reducing discrimination against them. It was therefore \nnot covered in this review. \n \nMethods \nSearch strategy \nThe following 17 electronic databases were searched from start date to 2002: ASSIA (Applied Social \nScience Index and Abstracts), Caredata, Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, \nCCTR, DARE), Dissertation Abstracts, Business Source Premier, Embase, HMIC (DH-Data, HELMIS, \nKing\u201fs Fund), IBSS (International Bibliography of the Social Sciences), Index to Theses, Infotrac, \nMedline, PolicyFile, PsycINFO, SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) Social \nServices Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science. Full details of the search strategy are \navailable from the authors. \n \nRelevant national and international sites on the world wide web were also searched: Centre for \nResearch in Social Policy, Department for Education and Skills, Department of Work and Pensions, \nDisability Archive, Disability Rights Commission, Employment and Disability Network, Economic \nand Social Research Council, Global Applied Disability Research and Information Network, Health \nDevelopment Agency, Inland Revenue, Joseph Rowntree Foundation, International Labour \nOrganisation, International Social Security Association, Local Government Association, National \nCentre for Social Research, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Social Policy \nResearch Unit, Social Services Inspectorate, Trades Union Congress - Research Section.  \n \nThe bibliographies of all reports, papers and texts that were reviewed were hand searched and \ninformation on unpublished and in-progress research was requested from key research institutes, \ncharities, experts in the field, and government departments and agencies.  \n 7 \n \nSelection \nThe review sought to identify all experimental and observational quantitative studies that examined the \neffectiveness of \u201ewelfare to work\u201f interventions specifically designed to help individuals with a \ndisability or chronic illness in the UK to move into work from welfare benefits. Qualitative studies that \ncould contribute to an assessment of why an intervention was or was not effective were also included. \nPapers not based on empirical research, but offering opinion or \u201cthink pieces\u201d only, were excluded. \nStudies that did not include employment as an outcome were excluded. The primary outcome measure \nwas employment uptake, but any reported impact on health or socio-economic circumstances was also \nnoted. Individuals with a disability or chronic illness of interest were those of working age (16-59\/64) \nwith a moderate physical or mental illness\/disability (OECD, 2003). Services specifically aimed at \npeople with learning difficulties were excluded.  \n \nCritical appraisal and data extraction \nCritical appraisal criteria, that could be  applied to observational as well as experimental quantitative \nstudy designs, and encompassing qualitative studies, were adapted from the systematic review \nmethodological literature (Black, 1996; Croucher, Quilgars, Wallace, Baldwin, & Mather, 2003;  \nEdwards, Elwyn, Hood, & Rollnick, 2000; Egan, Petticrew, Oglivie & Hamilton, 2003;  Malterud, \n2001; Mays & Pope, 2000; Popay, Rogers, & Williams, 1998) (Appraisal sheet available from authors). \nData were extracted by one reviewer (CB) and checked by a second (MW), both of whom  critically \nassessed each study against the appraisal criteria and resolved any differences in assessment by \ndiscussion. Studies of any type with substantive flaws were excluded from the final review of the \nevidence. We included percentages, confidence intervals (CIs), P values, and effect ranges when they \nwere reported in the original study or calculated these statistics if sufficient information was available. \n \n \n \nResults  \nThe search strategy identified 5399 studies in total (Web figure B), sixteen of which were included in \nthe final analysis (Arksey, 2003; Arthur & Zarb, 1997; Atkinson & Kodz, 1998; Banks, Riddell, & \n 8 \nThornton, 2002; Beinart, 1997; Beinart, Smith, & Sproston, 1996; Corden & Sainsbury, 2001; Heenan, \n2002; Hillage, Williams, & Pollard, 1998; Hills, Child, Blackburn, & Youll, 2001; Loumidis, Stafford, \nYoungs, Green, Arthur & Legard, 2001; Maton, Smyth, Broome, & Field, 2000; Riddell, Banks, & \nWilson, 2002; Rowlingson & Berthoud, 1996; Thornton & Corden, 2002; Thornton, Hirst, Arksey, & \nTremlett, 2001). Seven of the included studies were identified from electronic databases, six from \nwebsite searches, two from personal communications, and one from citation follow-up. The studies \nwere all recent, the earliest dated from 1996 (Beinart et al., 1996; Rowlingson & Berthoud, 1996). This \nreflects both the upsurge in welfare to work programmes in the UK and an accompanying increase in \nthe evaluation of policy interventions. References to a further three potentially relevant studies were \nlocated, but these were either unobtainable (Employment Department, 1990) or under legal embargo \n(Corden & Sainsbury, 2003; IES, 2003) and therefore could not be reviewed. \n \nDetails of the study designs of the sixteen reviewed studies are summarised in tables 1 to 5, grouped \nunder the five main \u201cwelfare to work\u201d strategies. No experimental trials were identified. Eleven were \nquantitative observational studies (only two of which were controlled) and five were entirely or largely \nqualitative. It was noteworthy that nine of the eleven observational studies also contained substantial \nqualitative components, specifically aimed at identifying why an intervention was or was not effective \nand for whom.    \n \nEvaluations of education, training and work placement initiatives \nFour studies assessed the effects of education, training and work placement initiatives on the \nemployment of people with a disability or chronic illness (table 1). All of the studies found a positive \nimpact on employment for participants in the initiatives: 18.5% (Banks et al., 2002), 20.8% (Riddell et \nal., 2002), 15% (Hills et al., 2001), and 50% (Maton et al., 2000) of participants were employed after \ninvolvement in the interventions.  \n \nThe studies examined three very different education, training and work placement initiatives. The Work \nPreparation scheme was run by Jobcentre Plus and offered three different types of training: work \nplacement, in-house personal development and vocational training, and a modular approach which \ncombined aspects of both (Banks et al., 2002). The two Work Preparation evaluations, whilst both \n 9 \nfinding that the employment rate of disabled people was moderately increased by involvement in the \nscheme, nonetheless differ over which aspect of Work Preparation was the most successful and for \nwhom. The Riddell and colleagues (2002) study of Work Preparation in Scotland noted that the \nemployment outcome for the work placement strand was significantly higher than for the in-house or \nmodular strands (p<0.001). However, the Banks and colleagues (2002) study of Work Preparation \nschemes in three English regions was less conclusive (perhaps due to unknown outcomes for over half \nof the cases, response rate <60%), as whilst employment was a more likely result of participation on \nthe work placement strand in two of the three regions, in the third, it was a less likely result.  They also \ndiverged over the extent to which employment rates varied by type of impairment, as the Riddell and \ncolleagues (2002) study suggested that particular groups, most notably those with mental health \nproblems, had fewer opportunities to participate and were less likely to gain employment as a result of \ntheir participation (p<0.007). In contrast,  Banks and colleagues (2002) found no significant difference \nby impairment type (p=0.26).  \n \nThe New Deal for Disabled People is part of the current Government\u201fs broader New Deal programme \nfor all types of benefit claimants (DWP, 2003b). It incorporates two different elements, the Innovative \nSchemes, and the Personal Adviser Service. The Innovative Schemes were designed to assist \nindividuals to move into employment and they include a variety of both training and work placement \nschemes (they also included some vocational advice and support services). The Hills and colleagues \n(2001) evaluation of the New Deal Innovative Schemes covered twenty-four diverse schemes run by \npublic, voluntary, and private sector agencies. Monitoring data, combined with findings from in-depth \nqualitative studies, were used to compare the relative effectiveness of the different schemes. The \naverage employment rate achieved by participants on schemes that had been in operation for two years \nwas 39%, but this varied extensively across the constituent schemes, ranging from 14% to 80%.  \nSchemes with a higher employment rate were characterised by the selection of more \u201ejob ready\u201f clients, \nas in the case of one scheme that was run by a national company and trained clients for specific work \nwithin their call centres. Another type of scheme that achieved higher employment rates shaped \ntraining to the needs of the local labour market, as in the case of a local authority scheme that was non-\ndiscriminating in its recruitment, but provided high levels of training, had good relations with local \nemployers, and offered ongoing support once employment was gained. Schemes that achieved a lower \n 10 \nrate of participant employment tended to either focus on the employment needs of those groups of \ndisabled people considered less \u201ejob ready\u201f, (for example, one scheme focused on people with mental \nhealth problems); or they offered less support to participants, were not in-tune with the needs of the \nlocal labour market, or had fewer resources and less skilled staff. \n \nThe Residential Training scheme used specialist-training colleges to provide extensive one-year \neducation and training courses, sometimes leading to vocational qualifications, for people with \ndisabilities and chronic illnesses. The study by Maton and colleagues (2000) analysed output data from \nall 14 UK training colleges to establish the subsequent employment rate of participants. Employment \nrates reached 43% one month after participation in the course, rising to 50% of participants eighteen \nmonths later. The majority of employment was full time (76%) and permanent (73%). Participants with \nsensory problems were less likely to be employed after participation than others (23.6% compared to \n43%). Furthermore, those with shorter periods out of work before participating were more likely to be \nemployed after the intervention. The study also surveyed 150 former participants and asked their views \nof the scheme: 70% perceived that the training programmes had improved their employment \nopportunities and some (16%) felt that it had enabled them to gain better employment than would \notherwise have been the case. \n \nEvaluations of vocational advice and support services \nTable 2 summarises the results of the four studies that evaluated vocational advice and support \nservices. The studies all indicated that involvement with vocational advice and support services \nimproved the employment rate among people with a disability or chronic illness, though only one of \nthe studies had controls.  This controlled study failed to find a statistically significant difference in \noutcome between participants and non-participants in the schemes.    \n \nPlacement and Assessment Counselling Teams (renamed Disability Service Teams in 1999) were \nresponsible for the provision of specialist Disability Employment Advisers, who in turn provided \nassessments of the vocational and training needs of individuals with a disability or chronic illness, \nhelped them gain placements, gave advice and guidance to both them and prospective employers, and \nhelped with locating and gaining suitable employment. Beinart's (1997) evaluation involved a survey of \n 11 \n700 Placement and Assessment Counselling Teams\u201f clients who were asked about their involvement \nwith the service and their subsequent employment history. The evaluation found an overall increase in \nthe employment rate after 6 months from 18% to 26%. However, only a quarter of people who gained \nwork attributed it to their involvement with the service. Women were more likely to be employed than \nmen (32% compared to 24%), and participants with a mental illness were more likely to remain out of \nwork than people with physical disabilities (29% compared to 18%).   \n \nThe New Deal for Disabled People Personal Adviser Service was part of the wider New Deal for \nDisabled People programme that also incorporated the Innovative Schemes. The Personal Adviser \nService offered one-to-one support and guidance to people with a disability or chronic illness on \nlocating, obtaining and remaining in employment. Our review located two studies that evaluated this \nservice. A study by Loumidis and colleagues (2001) included a controlled comparison of participants \nand non-participants exits from benefits, found that 11% of participants, compared to 7% of non-\nparticipants, left benefits over the two-year observation period. Participants also left benefits at a \nquicker rate than non-participants, and benefit exit was more likely (p<0.05) amongst those participants \nwith a shorter history of benefit duration, lone parents (OR 3.84), and those not involved in training or \neducation (OR 2.08). The evaluation found no difference in outcome by gender. It should be noted that \nbenefit exit does not necessarily equate with employment. The results of the qualitative assessments \n(Loumidis et al., 2001; Heenan, 2002) supported the findings of the quantitative studies, with \nparticipants perceiving that the intervention had a positive impact on their employment, self-esteem and \nsocial inclusion: \u201eit turned my life around\u201f (Heenan, 2002). However, there were also some concerns \nexpressed by participants about the quality of the employment gained (Loumidis et al., 2001).  \n \nThe final study in this category was of a small-scale, short-lived, local government funded project - the \nPeople into Employment Service (Arksey, 2003).  This service focused on providing employment for \ndisabled people and carers in an area of high unemployment (Sunderland, Tyne and Wear).  Monitoring \ndata from the scheme showed a high rate of employment gain for participants with a disability or \nchronic illness. By the end of the two-year project, 44 out of a total 68 clients with disabilities had \nobtained jobs. No information was given about how applicants to the service were selected, nor how \nsustainable the jobs were.  This success was attributed, from the qualitative component of the study, to \n 12 \nthe favourable client-to-adviser ratio, which enabled staff to tailor job search activities and support to \nspecific individual needs and also provide more in the way of ongoing help and support once \nemployment had been gained. \n \nEvaluations of in-work benefits \nFour studies evaluated the strategy of providing in-work benefits (table 3), including Disability \nWorking Allowance, the Travel to Work programme, the Disabled Person\u201fs Tax Credit, Jobmatch, the \n52-week linking rule, and the Job Finder\u201fs Grant. Whilst three of the four studies indicated that the \nprovision of in-work benefits had a positive influence on the employment levels of some people with a \ndisability or chronic illness who took up the benefits, awareness of, and uptake of, the benefits among \nthe target population was generally low, and  other major factors meant that the impact of this strategy \nwas weak. The Disability Working Allowance was introduced in 1991 as a wage top-up for disabled \npeople in paid work. It was intended to act as an incentive for movement off benefits and into work. In \n1995 it was subjected to some changes, such as access to free NHS prescriptions and extra money for \nthose working over 30 hours per week, which were intended to further enhance its effectiveness. The \ntwo (linked) studies that examined the Disability Working Allowance (DWA) were carried out before \n(Rowlingson & Berthoud, 1996) and after (Arthur & Zarb, 1997) the changes to the benefit. The first \nstudy (Rowlingson & Berthoud, 1996), was a multi-faceted controlled evaluation. It encompassed a \ncross-sectional study of people on sickness and disability benefits, postal and face-to-face follow-up \nsurveys of sub-samples of the original survey over two years, two cohort studies of people who had \nrecently moved on to Disability Working Allowance followed for one and two years, two pieces of \nqualitative work with disabled people to investigate their attitudes to employment, barriers to work and \nexperiences of DWA, and lastly a survey and case study work with a sample of applicants who had \nbeen rejected for DWA. The conclusion drawn from the various facets of the study was that helping \ndisabled people move into work was the key aim of DWA but the benefit had not been very successful \nin achieving it. Putting the benefit into the wider context, between 1992 and 1995, only 2% (30,000) of \nthe 1.5 million working-age recipients of one of the main incapacity benefits moved off these benefits \ninto full-time work. Virtually all of these made the transition from benefits to work without the help of \nDWA.  In addition, the study found that: \n \n 13 \n Two-thirds of those on the qualifying benefits had not heard of DWA and so could not have been \nencouraged into work by the benefit; \n Although respondents who were aware of DWA at the start of the study were twice as likely to \ngain employment over the follow-up period than those who were unaware, this difference was not \nstatistically significant (10% of aware gained employment v. 5% of unaware, difference n.s.) \n Only 200 of the 3,500 claiming DWA in October 1993 had been directly encouraged into work by \nthe benefit.  \n From the qualitative studies, a number of reasons emerged for the observed low impact of the \nDWA, in addition to low awareness of the benefit: many disabled people felt unable and had very \nlow expectations of working again; those who could or wished to work wanted to move into full-\ntime \u201cproper\u201d jobs paying a fair wage - independent of state help; there were many barriers to \nwork including overall lack of jobs, employers\u201f attitudes, unattractive jobs of low status, low pay.    \n \nThe second Disability Working Allowance study (Arthur & Zarb, 1997) was based on a 1996 postal \nsurvey of a nationally representative sample of 2,800 people who received DWA in 1995, comparing \nthose who received DWA before and following the 1995 changes to the benefit.  Of all respondents still \nin work at the time of the survey, 45% said they would probably or certainly not be in a job without \nDWA. This was similar to the pattern observed in the Rowlingson & Berthoud survey in 1993. Taking \nthe results as a whole, Arthur & Zarb concluded that there had not been any significant increase in the \noverall incentive effect of the intervention since 1995. \n \n \nThe Travel to Work scheme was part of the wider Access to Work programme that provides financial \nassistance towards the costs of removing the physical barriers that disabled people face when entering \nthe labour market. Travel to Work provided a contribution towards the costs of transportation to and \nfrom the workplace, for example, taxi fares. The only assessment  of this intervention (Thornton & \nCorden, 2002) was a largely qualitative study of users that concluded: \u201cthere was strong evidence from \nusers that Travel to Work was essential to taking up a job\u201d and that, furthermore, around a quarter of \nrespondents reported that there was \u201ca strong possibility of losing their job without Travel to Work\u201d. \n \n 14 \n \nFour other schemes involving the introduction of in-work benefits: the Disabled Person\u201fs Tax Credit, \nJobmatch, the 52-week linking rule, and the Job Finder\u201fs Grant, were assessed in one qualitative study \nof perceptions of recipients of these benefits (Corden & Sainsbury, 2001). The Disabled Person\u201fs Tax \nCredit was perceived to have influenced some decisions to take work, especially when it offered a \nhigher amount of in-work financial assistance. Likewise, the Jobmatch scheme was perceived as \nhaving had a positive influence and the 52-week linking rule, despite low awareness, was highly valued \nby those whose decisions it had influenced. The study also reported that the Job Finder\u201fs Grant scheme \nhad no perceived effect on employment uptake, as those that had experienced it viewed it as a reward, \nrather than an incentive.  \n \nEvaluations of employer incentive initiatives \nNo quantitative studies were located that evaluated incentive schemes for employers, but the two \nqualitative studies  both suggested a positive employment outcome for participants (table 4). One of the \nstudies, Atkinson & Kodz (1998), examined the Job Introduction Scheme; a 6-13 week wage subsidy \npaid directly to firms that employ a benefit claimant with a disability or chronic illness.  The study \nmainly explored the views of benificiaries, administrators of the scheme and participating employers. A \nmajority of the employers reported that they had maintained employment for participants of the scheme \nat the end of the 6-13 week placement. The employers interviewed also admitted that the intervention \ntended to be used to fill a hard to recruit vacancy or for part-time posts:  \n \n\u201ethe Job Introduction Scheme helped with the wages bill, but \nwe would probably have taken him on anyway. We desperately \nneeded to fill the post\u201f.  \n \nThe majority of employment obtained as a result of the intervention was subsequently low paid and low \nskilled: one employer acknowledged that it was possible to \u201eearn more on benefits than in this type of \nwork\u201f. The study concluded that, because the Job Introduction Scheme only offered employers \u00a3270 \n(\u00a345\/week at the time of the study in 1997) towards the total cost of the placement, it only appealed to \na very small niche of employers, and that a more substantial sum would be required to increase the \n 15 \nfuture appeal of the scheme.  Indeed, the level of subsidy had not kept pace with inflation since it was \nfirst introduced in 1977 \u2013 if it had, the subsidy would be worth close to \u00a3100 per week, rather than the \n\u00a345 offered to employers in 1997. \n \nThe Corden and Sainsbury (2001) study reported on participants\u201f and non-participants\u201f views of the \nusefulness of another employer incentive scheme - the Work Trial programme. This programme \nenabled employers to assess the capabilities of a disabled applicant whilst the individual remained on \nbenefits. The study found that all participants obtained employment after the 15-day intervention period \nhad ended, but that longer-term retention was considered to be a potential problem. The views of those \nwho did not directly experience the Work Trial scheme were split between some who welcomed the \nopportunity and those who were reluctant to work without wages.  \n \nAccessibility evaluations \nThe Access to Work scheme is made up of four main types of support: the Travel to Work scheme \n(reviewed in the \u201cin-work benefits\u201d section), on-the-job support, aids and equipment, and alterations to \npremises. Table five summarises the results of four  studies that evaluated the impact of parts of the \nAccess to Work initiative. None of the studies was controlled.  One was a qualitative study of recipients \nof help under the Access to Work scheme (Thornton and Corden, 2002), one was a cross-sectional \nsurvey of recipients (Thornton et al, 2001); and two (linked) studies were multi-faceted and included \ncross-sectional interview surveys with a national, random sample of applicants for Access to Work \nsupport, coupled with surveys of employers, and qualitative interviews with managers, administrators \nand providers of the constituent services (Beinart et al, 1996; Hillage et al, 1998).  \n \nThe results were generally positive for participants in the scheme: in the 1995 national survey, 49% of \nrecipients reported that they would not have commenced employment without the intervention (Beinart \net al, 1996), while in the similar survey in 1997, 41% of recipients made the same response (Hillage et \nal, 1998). Employers were more ambivalent about the impact of the scheme, with 17% in the 1997 \nsurvey saying that that they would not have employed\/continued to employ the recipient without the \nintervention, while 68% said that it made no difference (Hillage et al, 1998). \n  \n 16 \nIn both the 2000 national survey recipients (Thornton et al, 2001) and the 2001 qualitative study \n(Thornton and Corden, 2002), substantial proportions of recipients expressed the view that they \u201ccould \nnot work without it\u201d or it would be \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that they would be in employment without it.  \nThese overall results, however, mask  variation in the impact of Access to Work by type of \nemployment, \u201eimpairment\u201f, and type of support received. One study, by Thornton and colleagues \n(2001), found that employees in the private sector (53%) more likely to report that they could not work \nwithout it than public sector employees (40%). It also found that individuals with certain types of \nimpairment, such as mental health problems (53%) or eye complaints (55%) were more likely than \nothers, such as those with musculo-skeletal problems (40%) or ear complaints (43%), to say that they \ncould not work without the scheme. Another study, Thornton and Corden (2002), compared the \ndifferent types of support offered by Access to Work, and whilst in overall terms its findings were \npositive, the study revealed variations in participants\u201f views of the scheme by the specific type of \nsupport that was received under the Access to Work umbrella. The scheme was more positively rated by \nusers of on-the-job support and those in receipt of special aids and equipment, than those who had \nexperienced the \u201calterations to premises\u201d scheme.  \n \nDiscussion \nEffectiveness of welfare to work \nOverall, there is evidence that the various welfare to work programmes operating in the UK in the \n1990s helped people with disabilities into work who were previously on benefits.  The proportion of \nparticipants gaining employment after involvement in one or other of the schemes ranged from 11% to \n50%, and was dependent on a number of factors, including how selective the services were in accepting \napplicants onto the schemes; the age, type of disability and \u201cjob-readiness\u201d of participants, as well as \nthe wider labour market and social security context.  Participants generally reported positive \nperceptions and experiences of the schemes. What is harder to determine, however, from the available \nevidence is how much of the success of participants in gaining employment could be attributed to the \nspecific  welfare to work programme in which they participated, and how much to external factors \ninfluencing employment trends in general. Study designs with controls would have helped to answer \nthis question, but few of the identified studies were controlled. The   two controlled studies (Loumidis \net al, 2001; Rowlingson & Berthoud, 1996) reported higher subsequent employment rates for \n 17 \nparticipants compared to non-participants but the differences were not statistically significant. It is \ntherefore not possible from the identified studies to isolate the employment impact of the schemes as \nsuch. One possibility is that the demand for labour was expanding in the UK over the same period, \nincreasing opportunities for employment for people with and without a disability (Smith and Twomey, \n2002). Indeed,  all the studies were conducted at some point in the period between 1993 and 2002, \nwhich was a period of general employment expansion in the UK (ONS, 2003b). We cannot tell if the \nemployment outcomes would have been achieved in a less hospitable employment market.  \n \nThe very comprehensive study by Rowlingson and Berthoud (1996) was the only one \nto address the broader effectiveness question of what impact a specific scheme could \nhave on the total number of disabled people on benefits in the country who wanted to \nmove into work. The findings were not encouraging: of the estimated 1.5 million \ndisabled people on benefits in the country only 2% (30,000) moved into work in 1993, \nthe vast majority of whom did so without the help of the scheme under evaluation \u2013 \nthe Disability Working Allowance. In that year, there were 3,500 claimants for the \nDWA, only 200 of whom had been encouraged into work directly by the scheme. The \nqualitative pieces of work within this study were important in examining which of the \nunderlying assumptions on which the scheme was built were incorrect. The findings \nchallenged the assumption that awareness of DWA would be high (it was very low) \nand that disabled people were likely to want\/be able to work shorter hours and at \nlower rate of pay than non-disabled people (respondents wanted \u201cproper\u201d full-time \njobs at a \u201cfair wage\u201d). The qualitative components of this and several of the other \nlarger studies were able to unpick barriers and facilitators concerned with the effective \nimplementation of the schemes, which should aid design of initiatives in the future. On \nthe issue of differential impact, it was difficult to determine from the studies under review who, within \nthe disabled and chronically ill population, the welfare to work schemes helped into employment. \nThere was very little evidence provided by any of the included studies about the characteristics of \n 18 \nsuccessful participants in terms of gender, age, type of impairment\/disease, or socio-economic status. \nThe few studies that did include such factors (Rowlingson & Berthoud, 1996; Beinart, 1997; Maton et \nal, 2000; Loumidis et al, 2001; Banks et al, 2002; Riddell et al, 2002) tended to focus their analysis \nupon differential outcomes by disease type; and the evidence they offered was inconclusive. Only three \nstudies differentiated their findings by gender; one found a higher employment rate for women for the \nvocational advice and support services intervention (Beinart, 1997), one found no difference by gender \nfor that intervention (Loumidis et al, 2001), and another study that evaluated in-work benefits found \nthat single men were more likely to gain employment than single women (Rowlingson & Berthoud, \n1996). \n \nResearch implications \nThis systematic review has collected, analysed and synthesised the available evidence on the \neffectiveness of UK welfare to work programmes aimed at individuals with a disability or chronic \nillness. Locating the included research was more difficult than had been anticipated, as most of the \nincluded studies (9 out of a total of 16) were not identified through the extensive electronic searches. \nResearch on welfare programmes, and especially research on welfare to work as it relates to people \nwith a disability or a chronic illness, is poorly indexed in the electronic databases. This has also been \nthe experience of other systematic reviews on social policy topics as diverse as housing (Thomson, \nPetticrew & Morrison, 2001), mortgages (Croucher et al, 2003), and transportation (Egan et al, 2003), \nwhich have all subsequently had to rely more heavily upon citation follow-up, internet searches, and \npersonal communications.     \n \nThe overall quality of the observational studies for evaluating employment outcomes was variable. The \nlack of controls in all but two of the studies limited the inferences that could be drawn about \neffectiveness in relation to employment outcomes. Four were limited to measures of perceived benefits \nrather than actual employment outcomes. The qualitative studies were similarly problematic in some \ncases, where only sparse information was given about the participants\u201f  characteristics, selection \nprocess, or conduct of the study.  On the other hand, there were some impressively comprehensive \nstudies, which combined quantitative and qualitative elements, conducted with a range of relevant \nstakeholders (users, employers, service managers, administrators and providers).  These demonstrate \n 19 \ngood practice in the evaluation of complex social interventions, in which it is important not only to \nregister the outcome, but also to find out how the desired outcome was, or was not, achieved. This \nincludes investigating how well an intervention has been implemented and understanding the \ninteraction of the various components of the intervention with the context in which it is being played \nout.  We need more of these kinds of evaluative studies to help answer policy-relevant questions.  \n \nThe evidence base on welfare to work is not extensive - the review only located sixteen studies of \nimpact in total. Whilst at least one study was located on each of the 5 main types of welfare to work \nstrategy, there were still some evidence gaps. Experimental evidence was particularly lacking, as, for \nexample the evaluation of employer incentives was limited to subjective assessments of the perceptions \nof participants and employers. Several aspects of other interventions were also only assessed in this \nway. The review process revealed that most of the research on welfare to work programmes was either \nunconcerned with employment outcomes, or only included them as a secondary element of a broader \nanalysis. Similarly, there was little consideration given to how welfare to work schemes for people with \na disability or chronic illness may have a differential impact by gender, ethnicity or social group. The \nreview shows that there is a clear need for more extensive research in this area, especially as the \nwelfare to work policy agenda continues to evolve in the UK. \n \nPolicy implications \nThe review indicates that some of the recent welfare to work programmes in the UK have produced \npositive effects in terms of their impact on the subsequent employment of those who took part in the \nschemes. A proportion of participants in welfare to work programmes directed at individuals with a \ndisability or chronic illness have moved into work after participation,  though it has not been possible \nto determine from the evaluations how much of the increased employment was attributable to the \nprogrammes themselves. The evidence reviewed  also tentatively suggests that some types of welfare to \nwork - most notably education, training and work placement, and vocational advice and support \nservices \u2013 are more soundly based  than others. In the employer incentive schemes, one of the sticking \npoints may have been practical - the financial value of some of the subsidies paid to employers had \ndeclined over the years, so that it was no longer sufficient to provide a credible incentive.  In terms of \nthe strategy of providing in-work benefits to disabled people, the underlying assumptions on which the \n 20 \nschemes are based may have to be re-examined - people with disabilities wanted proper jobs paying a \nfair wage, rather than being taken on in low-paid, part-time employment with earnings topped-up with \nstate benefits. The incentive appeal of this strategy is therefore potentially low.  No single UK welfare \nto work approach stands out as by far the best way of solving the twin policy problems of low \nemployment rates amongst people with a disability or chronic illness, and rising numbers of incapacity \nbenefit claimants (Treasury, 2003). Additional strategies are needed. In other European countries, such \nas Sweden, the policy emphasis has been on the prevention of individuals with a disability or chronic \nillness leaving employment in the first place, rather than on \u201etreatment\u201f measures to return them to the \nlabour market once they have left. This strategy may prove more fruitful in the long term and is the \nsubject of a subsequent review.  \n \nFunding:  \nThis study was funded as part of the UK\u201fs Economic and Social Research Council Centre for Evidence \nBased Public Health Policy,  \u201cEvidenceNetwork\u201d project grant number H141251011.\n 21 \nReferences \nAcheson, D., Barker, D., Chambers, J., Graham, H., Marmot, G., & Whitehead, M.
