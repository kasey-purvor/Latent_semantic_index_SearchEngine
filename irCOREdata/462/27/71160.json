Data collected by the CUTLASS Finland HF radar\nare used to illustrate the significant difference between the\ncosine component of the plasma convection in the F-region\nand the Doppler velocity of the E-region coherent echoes\nobserved at large flow angles. We show that the E-region\nvelocity is \u223c5 times smaller in magnitude and rotated by\n\u223c30\u25e6 clockwise with respect to convection in the F-region.\nAlso, measurements at flow angles larger than 90\u25e6 exhibit\na completely new feature: Doppler velocity increase with\nthe expected aspect angle and spatial anticorrelation with the\nbackscatter power. By considering DMSP drift-meter mea-\nsurements we argue that the difference between F- and E-\nregion velocities cannot be interpreted in terms of the con-\nvection change with latitude. The observed features in the ve-\nlocity of the E-region echoes can be explained by taking into\naccount the ion drift contribution to the irregularity phase ve-\nlocity as predicted by the linear fluid theory.\nKey words. Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere; ionospheric ir-\nregularities; plasma convection)\n1 Introduction\nThe auroral ionosphere is filled with the magnetic-field-\naligned irregularities that can be detected by coherent radars\n(Fejer and Kelley, 1980; Haldoupis, 1989; Sahr and Fe-\njer, 1996; Schlegel, 1996). At the F-region heights (above\n130 km) these irregularities are believed to move with the\nvelocity of plasma convection, V 0=E\u00d7B\/B2. Thus, the ve-\nlocity of irregularity motion in the F-region is a measure of\nthe electric field applied to the ionosphere. At the E-region\nheights of 100\u2013120 km the irregularity velocity depends on\nseveral parameters; among the most important ones are the\nelectric field magnitude E and the angles that the irregular-\nity propagation vector k makes with the electron background\ndrift V e0 (flow angle \u03b8 ) and magnetic field B (the comple-\nmentary off-perpendicular angle is called the aspect angle \u03b1).\nCorrespondence to: R. A. Makarevitch\n(r.makarevitch@lancaster.ac.uk)\nIn the E-region, the electron background drift V e0 to a good\napproximation equals the convection velocity in the F-region,\nV e0\u223c=V 0, since the electric field does not change signifi-\ncantly along the highly conductive magnetic field lines.\nA number of recent studies successfully exploited the de-\nscribed above electrical link between the F and E-regions, to\nstudy the velocity of the E-region irregularities as a function\nof the ionospheric electric field. In the UHF band, Foster and\nErickson (2000), in a unique subauroral experiment, stud-\nied the E-region Doppler velocity detected with the side lobe\nof the incoherent radar at Millstone Hill (440 MHz) in con-\njunction with the F-region electric field data from the radar\u2019s\nmain lobe on the same magnetic L shell. These authors dis-\ncovered an almost perfect linear relationship between the E-\nregion Doppler velocity and the electric field magnitude. In\nthe VHF band, a comparison between F-region drifts ob-\nserved by the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar\nand the Doppler velocities measured by the Scandinavian\nTwin Auroral Radar Experiment (STARE) VHF radars (140\nMHz) showed that the irregularity phase velocity for di-\nrections close to V e0 (\u03b8= 0\u25e6\u221260\u25e6) is significantly smaller\nthan the projection of V e0 onto the line-of-sight (l-o-s),\nVlos=Ve0 cos \u03b8 , while for larger flow angles \u03b8= 60\u25e6\u201390\u25e6, the\nDoppler velocity generally agrees with the electron drift ve-\nlocity projection, implying the cosine rule for the Doppler\nvelocity (Nielsen and Schlegel, 1985; Nielsen et al., 2002).\nHowever, Koustov et al. (2002) demonstrated that the cosine\nrule can be violated for the evening sector observations of the\nSTARE Finland radar. Later, Uspensky et al. (2003) made a\nmore general conclusion that for large drifts the cosine law\ncan be used only as a first approximation even at large flow\nangles, because the ion motions contribute substantially to\nthe irregularity phase velocity. In the HF band, Davies et\nal. (1999) reported smaller velocities of E-region decame-\nter irregularities observed by the Co-ordinated UK Twin Lo-\ncated Auroral Sounding System (CUTLASS) Finland radar\nas compared to the F-region plasma drifts measured by the\nEISCAT radar.\n1178 R.

Field of view plot of the averaged Doppler velocity observed\nby the CUTLASS Finland radar during the interval 14:40\u201314:50 UT\non 31 March 2000. Each radar cell is color coded according to the\ncolor bar shown in the left bottom part of the diagram. The color\nscheme for r=180\u2212765 km (r=765\u22121215 km) is indicated by the\ndigits to the left (right) of the color bar. The echoes in cells filled\nby the horizontal lines have, on average, positive velocities corre-\nsponding to the color of the line. Also shown are slant range marks\n(dashed circular curves) and PACE lines of equal magnetic latitudes\n3=60\u25e6, 65\u25e6, and 70\u25e6 (solid thick curves). Thick yellow curves 0\u20132\ndenote the off-perpendicular (aspect) angle line \u03b1=0\u25e6 (see text for\ndetails). Thin ragged solid black line shows the location of the av-\nerage power maxima along each radar beam. Two DMSP passes\n(F13: 14:43\u201314:48 UT and F12: 17:05\u201317:10 UT) with the mea-\nsured perpendicular ion velocities are indicated by white vectors.\nThe scale for the ion velocities is shown in the top right corner of\nthe diagram.\nSimultaneous observations of E-region velocities at HF\nand F-region plasma drifts are difficult to perform since cur-\nrently available HF radars are positioned too far equatorward\nfrom the incoherent radar locations. In this respect, an inter-\nesting approach was undertaken by Milan and Lester (1998),\nwho compared the CUTLASS Iceland E-region Doppler ve-\nlocities with the F-region drifts measured by the same radar\n100\u2013200 km poleward and eastward of the E-region scatter\narea. The authors found that the average E-region velocity,\nat small flow angles was well below the l-o-s component of\nthe F-region velocity though still correlated with it.\nIn this study we expand the approach of Milan and Lester\n(1998) with the goal to explore the relationship between the\nE-region HF Doppler velocity and the plasma drift in the F-\nregion at large flow angles. Earlier studies by Makarevitch et\nal. (2002a, b) and Milan et al. (2003) have indicated that the\ncosine law might not be appropriate at HF even at large flow\nangles, but the results were not well substantiated in the sense\nthat no reliable convection measurements were available. In\nthis study we use F-region convection measurements by the\nCUTLASS Finland HF radar supported by the Defence Me-\nteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) data on the ion drift\nvelocities in the upper F-region and compare them with the\nE-region Doppler velocity measurements.\n2 Observations\nThe CUTLASS Finland HF radar (62.3\u25e6 N, 26.6\u25e6 E), to-\ngether with the Iceland HF radar, forms the easternmost part\nof the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN)\nsystem of paired coherent HF radars and is designed to mon-\nitor the large-scale convection patterns at F-region heights\nin the high-latitude ionosphere (Greenwald et al., 1995).\nThe radar is agile in frequency (8\u201320 MHz) and measures\nthe Doppler velocity, backscatter power and width of iono-\nspheric echoes in 45-km steps (180\u20133500 km) for each of the\n16 radar beam positions separated by 3.24\u25e6 in azimuth. Beam\n0 (15) of the radar corresponds to the westernmost (eastern-\nmost) direction.\nWe concentrate in this study on a four-hour interval be-\ntween 13:30 and 17:30 UT on 31 March 2000. During this\nevent, from 13:30 UT to 16:30 UT, the radar observed a sta-\nble band of E-region echoes at slant ranges r=350\u2013750 km.\nAfter 16:30 UT the echoes became weaker, the band nar-\nrowed (r=400\u2013600 km) and eventually disappeared. During\nalmost entire period (13:40\u201317:10 UT), the radar observed\nsimultaneously F-region echoes at farther ranges r>750 km.\nCo-existence of the E- and F-region echoes, even in spatially\nseparated areas, provided an opportunity for velocity com-\nparisons in the E- and F-regions, because DMSP measure-\nments during the period under study did not indicate sig-\nnificant latitudinal variation of the convection intensity, as\nshown below.\nThroughout the period the IMF was very stable and south-\nward, Bz=\u22123 nT; By=\u22125 nT; the Kp index was also sta-\nble and around 3. The level of ionospheric absorption and\nmagnetic perturbations as measured by the IRIS imaging ri-\nometer at Kilpisjarvi (69.1\u25e6 N, 20.8\u25e6 E) and magnetometers\nof the IMAGE and SAMNET networks of high-resolution\nfluxgate magnetometers within the radar near FoV, was low,\n0.1\u20130.2 dB and 100\u2013250 nT, respectively, and exhibited lit-\ntle variation with time, indicating that the ionosphere was in\na quite stable state. Under the above conditions one would\nexpect that the convection pattern consists of 2 global cells\nwith the stable L-shell-aligned flow in the afternoon sec-\ntor of the magnetosphere (MLT\u223c=UT+2 for the radar FoV).\nIndeed, the SuperDARN global convection maps (not pre-\nsented here) based on the Ruohoniemi and Baker (1998)\ntechnique demonstrate the high degree of L-shell alignment\nof the flow for the interval under study and latitudes of inter-\nest.\nFigure 1 shows the location of the Finland radar and the\nradar FoV at near slant ranges r<1215 km.

In addition, Fig. 1\npresents ion drift data for two DMSP passes over the radar\nnear FoV during the interval under study. The vector length\nat each point of the path corresponds to the measured ion ve-\nlocity perpendicular to the path. The scale for the ion velocity\nis indicated in the top right corner of the diagram. Data from\nan DMSP altitude of 810 km were projected to the E-region\nheight of 110 km along the magnetic field line. The Doppler\nvelocity averaged over a 10-min interval, 14:40\u201314:50 UT\n(corresponding to the first pass of DMSP), is indicated by\nthe color according to the scheme given in the left bottom\npart of the diagram as a color bar. The velocity scale for\nranges 180\u2013765 km (765\u20131215 km) is indicated by the digits\nto the left (right) of the color bar. Cells filled with horizontal\nlines correspond to the positive velocities. The slant range\nmarks of 270, 360, 495, 630, 765, 900, 1035, and 1215 km\nare indicated by the dashed circular lines. We also show, by\nyellow curve 0, the line of perfect aspect angle at 110-km\naltitude (\u03b1=0), assuming that the radar rays undergo refrac-\ntion based on typical ionospheric profiles, as described by\nthe model (Bilitza, 2001) and using a simple geometric op-\ntics approach (Uspensky et al., 1994). Curves 1 and 2 rep-\nresent the zero aspect angle for the electron density reduced\nby 25% and 50%, respectively. Finally, the thin ragged solid\nblack line close to the yellow curve 1 shows the location of\nthe power maxima along each radar beam.\nAn important feature of the F-region echoes detected at\nfarther ranges (r=765\u22121215 km) is their negative velocities\nup to \u2212750 m\/s in the western part of the FoV and positive\nvelocities up to +500 m\/s in the eastern part of the FoV.\nThe change in the Doppler velocity sign occurs at beams\n9\u201310, corresponding to the direction nearly perpendicular\nto magnetic L shells, which is indicative of the L-shell-\naligned nature of the flow at far ranges. At closer ranges\n(r=180\u2212765 km), where E-region echoes were detected, no\nreversal of the velocity sign is observed. The E-region ve-\nlocity magnitude is maximized for beam 0 (red area with\nV=200 m\/s). It gradually decreases to 50 m\/s (blue area)\nwith the beam number increase being still negative for beam\n15. The range location of the power maxima (the black\nragged line in Fig. 1) follows closely the aspect angle curve 1.\nSince it is widely accepted that the echo power should be at\nmaximum for the range of perfect aspect angle (Fejer and\nKelley, 1980; Haldoupis, 1989; Sahr and Fejer, 1996), from\nhereafter we take the curve 1 from Fig. 1 as a model for the\naspect angle within the radar FoV.\nCuriously enough, in Fig. 1 at beams 13\u201315 the velocity\nmagnitude is smaller at r=360\u2212495 km, close to the range\nof the perfect aspect angle, as opposed to the velocity mag-\nnitudes at beams 0\u20135, where it is clearly at maximum at\nr\u223c= 495 km. To make this point clearer, we present the data of\nFig. 1 using a different format.

The scale for\naspect angle in degrees is given by small ticks \u00b110,\u00b15, 0\non the right axis. One can notice that for each radar look-\ndirection the average echo power has a clear maximum at\na range r0 corresponding closely to the range with perfect\naspect angle, \u03b1(r0)=0. The velocity magnitude profile for\nbeam 0 shows quite a similar slant range variation with max-\nimum at r0. However, in beam 15 there is no maximum of\nvelocity at r0, but distinct minimum. At intermediate beam\n9 the velocity change with slant range is not strong, with\nweakly-pronounced local minimum and maximum at 540\nand 630 km, respectively (both not at r0).\nTo explore this effect in more detail we present the same\ndata using a different approach developed by Makarevitch\net al. (2002b). Figure 3 shows the Doppler velocity versus\nL-shell angle for all 16 radar beams and all 23 slant range\nbins for each measurement within the 10-min period under\nconsideration.

The points correspond-\ning to E-region scatter are color coded in aspect angle \u03b1, as in-\ndicated in the bottom right part of the diagram. The red crosses\nare maxima\/minima of the averaged velocity along radar beams,\nas described in the text. The F-region velocities are shown by\nblack points. The solid thin (thick) line represents the best fit,\nV0 cos(\u03c6+\u03c60), to red crosses (all black points).\naspect angle is shown at the bottom right part of the diagram.\nOne can notice right away that F- and E-region echoes ex-\nhibit strikingly different velocity variations with the L-shell\nangle. The F-region echoes are steadily increasing in veloc-\nity from negative to positive values with L-shell angle; the\nreversal of the velocity sign occurs at \u03c6\u223c=90\u25e6. The E-region\nechoes are also progressively less negative with \u03c6 increase,\nbut no reversal in velocity sign occurs.\nOne of the most remarkable features of the E-region points\nis the presence of V-like structures. For example, the Doppler\nvelocity first increases in magnitude for \u03c6=51\u25e6\u221253\u25e6 and\nthen decreases for \u03c6=53\u25e6\u221256\u25e6 with the smaller aspect angle\npoints at the bottom of V-structure. We interpret this feature\nas associated with the aspect angle attenuation of the phase\nvelocity (Makarevitch et al., 2002b). Each V-structure is in\nfact the data from one of the radar beams. As the range and\nL-shell angle changes along the beam, so does the aspect an-\ngle, reaching at some range minimum where the phase veloc-\nity is expected to have maximum. The V-structures in Fig. 3\nare thus just another form of the Fig. 2a presentation. For\nhigh-number beams, for example, beam 15, the inverse-V-\nor 3-structures are seen instead, with the good aspect angle\npoints at the top of the 3-structures, which is rather unex-\npected but in agreement with the presentation of Fig. 2c (we\nreturn to the interpretation of this feature in Sect. 3). The V-\nor 3-structures are not recognizable in the middle part of the\ndiagram because the L-shell angle does not change much for\nthe central beams. Only points at the bottom (top) of V- (3-)\nstructures marked by the red crosses should be considered\nwhen comparing L-shell angle dependencies in the E- and F-\nregions, since all other points are significantly affected by the\naspect angle attenuation. To facilitate such a comparison we\n31\/03\/2000 13:40-17:10 UT\n1340 1400 1420 1440 1500 1520 1540 1600 1620 1640 1700\nUniversal Time\n-12\n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\nF\nit\nte\nd\nV\ne\nlo\nc\nit\ny\nV\n0\n,\n1\n0\n0\nm\n\/s\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\nF\nitte\nd\nL-S\nh\ne\nll\nA\nn\ng\nle\nf\n0 ,\nd\ne\ng\nFig. 4.

The fitted parameters, velocity V0\nand L-shell angle \u03c60, signify the flow velocity and devia-\ntion of the flow from the L-shell direction, respectively. One\nshould note here that in the above cosine model the fitted\nvelocity V0 is assumed to be negative, simply to reflect pre-\ndominantly negative Doppler velocities in our observations,\nso that a negative flow velocity V0 at \u03c6=0 implies westward\n(away from the radar) convecting plasma.\nOne can notice that in the F-region the flow is indeed\nhighly L-shell-aligned, \u03c60=\u22122\u25e6. It is not true, however,\nfor the E-region; the L-shell angle of the velocity reversal\nis shifted about 31\u25e6 to the east from the perpendicular di-\nrection \u03c6=90\u25e6, so that the azimuthal difference between di-\nrections of the flow in the F and E-regions is quite large,\n\u22122\u25e6\u2212(\u221231\u25e6)=29\u25e6, and so is the ratio between fitted veloci-\nties 1141\/203\u223c=5.5.\nIn Fig. 4 we further investigate the relationship between\nthe E-region velocity and the F-region plasma drift by show-\ning the fitted velocities V0 (blue) and L-shell angles \u03c60 (red)\nin the E (thin line) and F-regions (thick line) as a function\nof time for 10-min intervals during the entire period of inter-\nest, 13:40\u201317:10 UT. Also shown are the spans (minimum to\nmaximum) of the DMSP ion drifts for the two passes over the\nradar FoV. Again, thick (thin) line represents measurements\nfor the latitudes that correspond to the F- (E-) scatter region.\nOne can estimate that the obtained ratio of\u223c5 is very typical\nfor the entire period under study.\n3 Discussion\nThe fact that the E-region velocity is \u223c5 times smaller than\nthe F-region E\u00d7B drift velocity, together with a \u223c30\u25e6 shift\nin the azimuth of velocity reversal in the E and F-regions,\ncan be explained in two ways. One can think that since\nR. A. Makarevitch et al.: Simultaneous HF measurements of E- and F-region Doppler velocities at large flow angles 1181\nthe F- and E-region scatter areas were separated spatially by\n300\u2013400 km in our observations (Fig. 1), it is possible that\nit is the electric field (that mainly determines the Doppler\nvelocity) at latitudes of the E-region observations that was\nsmaller in magnitude and rotated by some angle with respect\nto that at latitudes of the F-region observations. However,\nthe DMSP measurements of the F-region ion drifts presented\nin Fig. 1 do not support this scenario, at least in terms of the\nconvection magnitude. One can see that the DMSP ion veloc-\nity does not change much in a broad range of latitudes. There\nis perhaps a 20% reduction in the ion drift at latitudes of the\nE-region observations, but one cannot expect the decrease in\nthe velocity magnitude of several times. It is impossible to\nsay whether this reduction was due to slight convection ro-\ntation or a simple decrease in the magnitude. Because the\nDMSP drift (one component of the ion drift vector) does not\nchange much from one point to another, we believe that no\nsignificant changes in the direction of the total ion drift vec-\ntor were taking place. Thus, the convection magnitude at\nranges of the E-region observations is comparable to the one\nmeasured at the ranges of F-region scatter, Figs. 1 and 4. In\nsupport of our conclusion, we would like to stress the fact\nthat our convection estimates from the CUTLASS data are in\ngood agreement with DMSP ion drifts at ranges of F-region\nobservations, Fig. 4. The CUTLASS\/DMSP comparisons for\ntwo passes give us confidence that the convection estimates\nfor the ranges of E-region observations and other periods are\nalso reliable.\nThe region of interest was also monitored by several sta-\ntions of the IMAGE magnetometer network located within\nthe CUTLASS near FoV. The IMAGE magnetometers mea-\nsure the north (X), east (Y ), and vertical (Z) components of\nmagnetic field perturbations with 10-s resolution. Figure 5\nis the magnetogram of the IMAGE X-component (1X) for\nfive IMAGE stations located along the CUTLASS beam 8.\nOn the right axis we indicated the station three-letter abbre-\nviations and geographic latitudes and longitudes. One can\nnotice that the 1X variation with time is very similar for\nall five stations and that it is more or less stable, especially\nduring the last two-thirds of the period under study. The\n1X time variation also resembles the F-region flow inten-\nsity variation from Fig. 4, which was gradually decreasing\ntowards the end of the period. The 1X magnitude some-\nwhat increases with latitude; thus 1X\u223c150 nT (300 nT) at\nthe most equatorward (poleward) station OUJ (SOR) during\na 10-min interval, 14:40\u201314:50 UT, the data from which were\nfeatured in Figs. 1\u20133. This \u223c2-fold increase with latitude in\nthe level of magnetic perturbation could, in principle, imply\nthe corresponding doubling of the electric field intensity at\nfarther ranges of the CUTLASS FoV, which is somewhat a\ngreater increase than that in the DMSP data, but still well\nbelow a factor of 5 for the typical ratio between F- and E-\nregion velocities observed. One should also keep in mind\nthat the magnetic perturbations do not necessarily represent\nthe \u201ctrue\u201d electric field variation, since the electrojet current\nintensity is also controlled by the plasma density distribution\nin the E-region.\n1620 1640 1700\nSOR\nIMAGEX Component\n70.50N\n22.20E\nMAS\n69.50N\n23.70E\nMUO\n68.00N\n23.50E\nPEL\n66.90N\n24.10E\nOUJ\n64.50N\n27.20E\nM\na\ng\nn\ne\nti\nc\nP\ne\nrt\nu\nrb\na\nti\no\nn\ns\n,\nn\nT\n1340 1400 1420 1440 1500 1520 1540 1600\nUniversal Time\n5\n0\n0\nn\nT\nFig. 5.

(2002),\nwho found that E-region HF velocities can be comparable\nwith the VHF STARE velocities which were observed at\nlarge aspect angles and thus, were strongly reduced as com-\npared to the plasma convection. Milan and Lester (1998)\nand Foster and Erickson (2000) reported only a factor of 2\nfor the ratio between F- and E-region velocities, but these\nobservations were performed along the flow. The velocity\ndifference was interpreted in these two studies in terms of\nthe ion acoustic saturation for the Doppler velocity of type 1\nirregularities (Nielsen and Schlegel, 1983, 1985; Robinson,\n1986, 1993; Nielsen et al., 2002; St.-Maurice et al., 2003).\nIn the present experiment, however, the observations were\nperformed across the flow. For these directions, type 2 irreg-\nularities are expected to be seen and thus a new explanation\nis needed.\nThe fact that in Fig. 4 the fitted E-region velocity shows\ngood temporal correlation with that in the F-region leads\nus to a conclusion that the E-region Doppler velocity is\nproportional to the F-region convection velocity, but strongly\n1182 R.

The reason for this effect is not entirely\nclear, and we consider here two possibilities.\nMakarevitch et al. (2002b) and Milan et al. (2003) pro-\nposed that low-velocity HF echoes are coming from the bot-\ntom of the unstable E-region, where the Doppler velocity is\nsmaller because of increased collisions with neutrals. Let us\ncomment on how this hypothesis helps in understanding the\ndata presented in this study.\nAccording to the linear fluid theory of electrojet irregu-\nlarities (e.g. Fejer and Kelley, 1980), the phase velocity at a\ndirection of wave propagation vector k\u02c6\u2261 k\/k is given by\nV = k\u02c6\u00b7V e0+9V i0\n1+9 , (1)\nwhere the anisotropy factor 9 (Sahr and Fejer, 1996) is a\nfunction of aspect angle \u03b1, collision frequencies of ions and\nelectrons with neutrals (\u03bdi , \u03bde) and ion and electron gyrofre-\nquencies (i, e):\n9 = \u03bde\u03bdi\nei\n(cos 2\u03b1 + \n2\ne\n\u03bd2e\nsin 2\u03b1). (2)\nThe expressions for both electron and ion background\ndrift velocity (V \u03b10, \u03b1=e, i) can be readily obtained from\nthe zeroth order momentum equations (e.g. Schlegel and St.-\nMaurice, 1981):\nV \u03b10 = 11+ (\u03bd\u03b1\/\u03b1)2\n[\nE\u00d7B\nB2\n+ \u03bd\u03b1\n\u03b1\nE\nB\n]\n. (3)\nIn the E-region (say, below 120 km), \u03bde\u001ce, \u03bdi\u001di , and\nV e0 \u223c= E \u00d7 B\nB2\n, V i0 \u223c= i\n\u03bdi\nE\nB\n, (4)\nwhich means that the ion drift velocity is much smaller than\nthat of electrons and rotated with respect to it by \u223c90\u25e6.\nWe note that Eq. (1) predicts proportionality between the\nirregularity velocity and the electron plasma drift, since the\nfirst term dominates in a broad range of flow angles with\nthe exception of observations close to the perpendicular-\nity to V e0. An increase in collision frequencies \u03bde, \u03bdi re-\nsults in the corresponding increase in the anisotropy fac-\ntor 9 and decrease in the irregularity phase velocity, be-\ncause of the 1+9 factor in the denominator. The calcu-\nlations based on the formulas for collision frequencies by\nSchunk and Walker (1973) and Schunk and Nagy (1978) give\n\u03bdi\u223c1.5\u00b7104 s\u22121, \u03bde\u223c105 s\u22121 and hence, an anisotropy factor\nof 9(\u03b1=0)=\u03bdi\u03bde\/(ii)\u223c1 at an altitude of 95 km. Thus,\nwe can estimate that this purely collisional depression of the\nDoppler velocity in the lower E-region (below 95 km) can be\nas large as 2 times, which can partially explain our observa-\ntions.\nHowever, this is still less than the reported factor 5.\nWe think that another effect might be involved, namely\nthe effect of echo reception from a range of altitudes\nwith quite different aspect angles, as described recently by\nUspensky et al. (2003). According to the model of Uspen-\nsky et al. (1994, 2003), auroral backscatter is always non-\northogonal since the purely orthogonal component, coming\nfrom just one height, constitutes only a fraction of all echo\npower. This means that observations at any spot of the iono-\nsphere can be characterized by some finite effective aspect\nangle. An increase in effective aspect angle \u03b1 results in the\ncorresponding increase in the anisotropy factor 9, Eq. (2),\nand decrease in the irregularity phase velocity. Estimates\nfor the STARE radars showed that the effective aspect an-\ngle can be in the range of 0.8\u25e6\u20131.0\u25e6 (Uspensky et al., 2003).\nIf one adopts effective aspect angles comparable to the ones\nexpected for STARE, one can explain additional velocity at-\ntenuation by a factor of 2\u20133.\nAnother consequence of the large anisotropy factor 9\nis an increase in the ion motion V i0 contribution to the\nphase velocity and rotation of the direction of maximum\nphase velocity away from the electron flow V e0. The lat-\nter effect, reported by Uspensky et al. (2003) as the 10\u25e6\u2013\n20\u25e6 azimuthal difference between F- and E-region velocity\nvectors seems to find some confirmation in the data of the\npresent study. Indeed, Fig. 4 shows that while the F-region\nflow was more or less L-shell aligned (|\u03c60|<8\u25e6), the E-\nregion flow was not, with the typical azimuthal difference\nbetween the flows larger than 15\u25e6 (except of the last 30\nmin). Figure 6 shows the result of phase velocity calcu-\nlations based on Eqs. (1)\u2013(3) for different anisotropy fac-\ntors 9 (red lines). For these calculations we assumed that\nthe ion drift is ten times smaller and rotated by 90\u25e6 clock-\nwise with respect to the electron drift, which is typical for\nthe central part of the E-region (105\u2013110 km), \u03bdi\u223c=1800 s\u22121\nand Vi0\/Ve0=i\/\u03bdi\u223c=1\/10. The electron drift was estimated\nfrom the F-region velocity measurements; we show the fitted\ncurves for the F- (blue) and E-regions (green) from Fig. 3.\nOne can see that all theoretical red curves intersect at one\npoint and, remarkably, this is also the point where fitted ex-\nperimental curves intersect. The theoretical line for 9=5\nR. A. Makarevitch et al.: Simultaneous HF measurements of E- and F-region Doppler velocities at large flow angles 1183\nagrees well with the fitted E-region velocity curve, suggest-\ning that the anisotropy factor was indeed quite large. If so,\none might wonder why exactly the anisotropy factor was so\nlarge. As we argued, the enhanced collision frequencies at\nthe bottom of the E-region coupled with the effectively non-\northogonal scatter can be a reason, but in this scenario the\nion drift would be too small (of the order of 1\/100Ve0 only)\nto cause any significant shift in the E-region velocity rever-\nsal direction from 90\u25e6 of the flow angle (e.g. similar to those\nin Fig. 6). This is why in the reasoning above we assumed\nthat the E-region echoes originated mainly from the electro-\njet center.\nAn important new result of this study is that for large flow\nangle observations (\u03c6>90\u25e6), the E-region velocities were\nat minimum at a range r0 where the echo power was at\nmaximum and where the model aspect angle was around\nzero (Fig. 2c and right part of Fig. 3, where instead of\nV-structures, 3-structures were observed). This velocity de-\ncrease near r0 is very unlikely to be caused by the decrease\nin the electric field intensity at these ranges, since the DMSP\nconvection component is quite stable over this area, Fig. 1.\nTo some extent, this result reminds us of observations of\nMakarevitch et al. (2002a), who reported the absence of the\naspect angle attenuation for the Doppler velocity at large\nL-shell angles \u03c6\u223c=90\u25e6. Makarevitch et al. (2002a) explained\ntheir result in terms of the ion drift contribution to the irreg-\nularity phase velocity at large flow angles. We believe that\na similar explanation can be applied to the present observa-\ntions, as outlined below.\nEquation (1) can be rewritten in terms of the flow angle\n[\u03b8\u2261 cos\u22121(k \u00b7 V e0\/kV e0] as\nV\u223c=cos \u03b8+9i\/\u03bdi sin \u03b81+9 Ve0, (5)\nor\nV\u223c=\n[\ncos \u03b8 \u2212i\/\u03bdi sin \u03b8\n1+9 +i\/\u03bdi sin \u03b8\n]\nVe0. (6)\nOne should note here that Eq. (6) is more appropriate for\ndiscussion of the aspect angle effects, since only the first term\nis dependent upon 9 and hence, upon the aspect angle \u03b1.\nThe simplest formulation of the linear fluid theory that\ntakes into account only the electron motions predicts that the\nvelocity should change with \u03b8 as Ve0 cos \u03b8\/(1+9) and fall\noff to zero with the aspect angle \u03b1 increase. If the ion mo-\ntions are included into calculations, the situation changes. In\nthis case the phase velocity at large flow and aspect angles\nwill be determined mostly by the ion drift l-o-s component\nor the second term in Eq. (6), since the first term is reduced\ndrastically because of the enhanced anisotropy factor 9 at\nlarge aspect angles.\nWe illustrated this point in Fig. 7 which shows the results\nof the phase velocity calculations based on Eqs. (1)\u2013(3). The\nphase velocity is shown in Fig. 7 as a function of the as-\npect angle for various flow angles. As before, the typical\n(for the central part of the E-region) collision frequencies\n\u03bdi=1800 s\u22121, \u03bde=15 000 s\u22121 were assumed, as well as the\nf=40\n0\n-500\n0\n500\nf= 50\n0\nf= 60\n0\nf= 70\n0\nf= 80\n0\n-4 -2 0 2 4\nAspect Angle,a, deg\nf= 90\n0\nf= 100\n0\nf = 110\n0\nf= 120\n0\nP\nh\na\ns\ne\nV\ne\nlo\nc\nit\ny,\nm\n\/s\nV = 1100 m\/s\n= 15000 s\n= 1800 s\ne 0\nn\nn\ne\ni\n-1\n-1\nFig. 7. Phase velocity versus aspect angle \u03b1 for various L-shell an-\ngles \u03c6 assuming exactly L-shell aligned electron flow (\u03b8=\u03c6) Ve0 =\n1100 m\/s and collision frequencies typical for the center of electro-\njet region. The large grey (black) circles show the phase velocity\nat \u03b1=0\u25e6 (\u03b1= \u2212 1\u25e6). The grey thick (black thin) line represents the\nflow angle variation of the phase velocity for minimum achievable\naspect angle of 0\u25e6 (\u22121\u25e6).\nexact L-shell aligned electron flow, Ve0=1100 m\/s. For each\npanel of Fig. 7, the L-shell angle is constant (we indicated\nthis angle at the top, for example, \u03c6=40\u25e6 for the leftmost\npanel), while the aspect angle is changing from \u22125\u25e6 to +5\u25e6.\nThus, each panel models radar observations in one beam po-\nsition.\nLet us first have a look at the left part of the diagram\n(\u03c6=40\u25e6\u221270\u25e6). The phase velocity magnitude maximizes at\nzero aspect angle and decreases with the aspect angle in-\ncrease. The velocity at zero aspect angle is approximately\nequal to the l-o-s component of the electron drift velocity,\nand we connected points with perfect aspect angle (shown\nby grey circles) with the grey thick line, which is essentially\na simple \u201ccosine law\u201d curve Ve0 cos \u03b8 , similar to the fitted\nF-region cosine curves in Figs. 3 and 6.\nAt large aspect angles, however, velocity is not zero but\nsome finite value, which is determined by the second ion\nterm in Eq. (6). For our observations, the latter can be easily\nestimated from Eq. (4); the electron drift is \u223c1100 m\/s and\nhence, the ion Pedersen drift is \u223c110 m\/s and directed north-\nward (along the poleward electric field in the afternoon sec-\ntor) that is away from the radar, providing a negative offset of\n\u223c110 m\/s in the E-region velocity, consistent with our obser-\nvations. Importantly, the phase velocity calculations show\nthat for certain flow angles (as for \u03c6=90\u25e6 in Fig. 7), the\nphase velocity is less in magnitude at perfect aspect angle\nthan at larger ones. This is simply because at these direc-\ntions the ion motions become more significant at large as-\npect angles than the electron motions. This effect can explain\nthe reported minimum in the high-number beam velocities at\nranges near r0 that correspond to the power maximum and to\nthe minimum achievable aspect angles (Fig. 2c and right part\nof Fig. 3).\n1184 R. A. Makarevitch et al.: Simultaneous HF measurements of E- and F-region Doppler velocities at large flow angles\nOne can also notice that although the velocity decrease\nwith the aspect angle is seen in Fig. 7 for \u03c6=90\u25e6, the range\nof the L-shell angles with the 3-structures in Fig. 3 is much\nwider and extends from \u03c6\u223c=85\u25e6 to 113\u25e6. Another discrep-\nancy between Figs. 3 and 7 is that the maximum Doppler\nvelocities recorded were much smaller in magnitude than,\nfor example, \u2212500 m\/s that should be observed near \u03c6=60\u25e6.\nFollowing Uspensky et al. (2003), we argued that this reduc-\ntion can be related to the HF backscatter signal collection\nfrom the range of heights with the different finite aspect an-\ngles, which is equivalent to assigning some effective nonzero\naspect angle to a specific range.\nWe can now estimate the effect of the aspect angle \u201cfinite-\nness\u201d on the flow angle dependence using the presentation of\nFig. 7. We indicated by vertical lines the aspect angle of\u22121\u25e6,\nby black dots the theoretical velocities which correspond to\nthis aspect angle at \u03c6=60\u25e6, 90\u25e6, and 120\u25e6, and connected\nthese points by the thin black line. The phase velocity is\ngreatly reduced, especially for directions away from \u03c6=90\u25e6.\nFor example, for \u03c6=60\u25e6, it changes from \u223c500 to 200 m\/s.\nAnother interesting feature is that the black curve intersects\nthe zero velocity line to the right from the grey curve, mean-\ning that the phase velocity should be reversed at flow angles\nof more than 90\u25e6, consistent with our measurements. On\nthe other hand, in our observations the E-region velocity re-\nversal was not seen anywhere in the radar FoV, even at the\neasternmost beam 15 (\u03c6\u223c110\u25e6), while according to Fig. 7\nthis reversal should occur somewhere between 90\u25e6 and 110\u25e6.\nOne should note here, however, that in the reasoning above\nwe used a minimum aspect angle of \u22121\u25e6, consistent with an\nestimate for the STARE radar (144 MHz) obtained by Us-\npensky et al. (2003), who adopted an aspect sensitivity of\n10 dB per 1\u25e6 of aspect angle. Haldoupis (1989), by consider-\ning the publications on the aspect sensitivity at various radar\nfrequencies, concluded that the 50-MHz E-region echoes are\nperhaps less aspect sensitive than those at 150 and 400 MHz,\nwith the typical values in the range 1\u20133 dB\/\u25e6. Thus, if one\nassumes a slower rate of the power decrease with the aspect\nangle for observations at lower HF frequencies, say, 2 dB\/\u25e6\nreported recently by Makarevitch et al. (2002a), one can ar-\ngue that the effective aspect angle at HF should be larger and\nhence, one can reach better agreement between observations\nand theory.\nOn a more critical note, from Eq. (5) the flow angle cor-\nresponding to a maximum of the phase velocity (or, in other\nwords, the deviation of the flow from the E\u00d7B direction) is\ngiven by tan \u03b8max=9i\/\u03bdi and hence for fixed collision fre-\nquencies\/altitude should not depend upon the flow intensity\nVe0. Experimentally, Fig. 4 shows that this deviation tends\nto decrease in magnitude with a drift magnitude decrease,\nsuggesting that perhaps other (than Pedersen motion of ions)\nfactors can contribute to the total ion drift vector, for exam-\nple, the neutral wind. The detailed discussion of this issue is,\nhowever, beyond the scope of the present paper. We would\nlike only to point out that even a simple ion Pedersen drift\ninterpretation explains reasonably well most of the Doppler\nvelocity features observed in this study (small magnitudes,\ndeviation from the E\u00d7B direction, and the spatial anticorre-\nlation with the backscatter power).\n4 Summary and conclusion\nA comparison of the F- and E-region HF Doppler velocities\nobserved by the CUTLASS Finland radar shows that the E-\nregion velocities are typically several times smaller and do\nnot exhibit a change in their sign (within the radar FoV),\nas opposed to the F-region velocities. The E-region veloc-\nity variation with L-shell angle \u03c6 can be described by a\nshifted cosine function V0 cos(\u03c6+\u03c60), with the typical val-\nues of V0=\u2212 200 m\/s, \u03c60=\u221230\u25e6. For the high-number radar\nbeams, the Doppler velocity is minimized at slant ranges that\ncorrespond to the power maxima and minimum aspect angle,\nas determined from the model. The observed difference be-\ntween F- and E-region HF Doppler velocities, as well as the\nvelocity magnitude increase with the aspect angle at \u03c6>90\u25e6,\ncannot be explained by the electric field magnitude and direc-\ntion variation with latitude, but most likely is a result of the\nnon-orthogonality of backscatter coupled with the ion mo-\ntion contribution to the E-region irregularity phase velocity\nsignificant at large flow and aspect angles.\nAcknowledgements.
