Recycling these wastes\nvia land application could lead to improvements in physical properties of soil, such as soil porosity,\nstructure and water holding capacity (Le\u00f3n-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2000; Our\u00e9draogo et al., 2001; Nyamangara\net al., 2001). For this reason, the application of faecal wastes could be beneficial for soil conservation\n(Pinamonti and Zorzi, 1996), especially in degraded soils and soils susceptible to erosion, although the\nresponse to soil amendment is soil-site specific. However, the benefits of waste recycling may be partially\noffset by the risk of water pollution associated with runoff from fields to which slurry or manure has been\napplied, especially if rainfall occurs shortly after application.\nThe contamination of surface waters with pathogenic micro-organisms transported from fields to\nwhich livestock slurries and manure have been applied is a serious environmental concern because it may\nlead to humans being exposed to such micro-organisms via several routes: drinking water (Ongerth and\nStibbs, 1987; Hansen and Ongerth, 1991; Poulton et al., 1991; Skerrett and Holland, 2000); bathing\nwaters (Geldreich, 1996; Wyer et al., 1996; Baudart et al., 2000); and water used for the irrigation of\nready to eat foods (Tyrrel, 1999).\nThe aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of cattle manure application on soil erosion rates\nand runoff and on the detachment and transport of faecal coliforms.\nMaterial and methods\nThe study was performed in the laboratory. A sandy loam soil, classified as Lamellic\nUstipsamment (Soil Survey Staff, 1999), sampled at Bedfordshire, (UK) was used throughout the\nexperiments. The soil was passed through a 9.5 mm sieve and packed into soil flumes (2.5 m long x 1 m\nwide and 30 cm deep) at a bulk density of 1400 kg m-3, set at a 5 % slope. The flumes are designed to\nseparate overland flow from water that has infiltrated the soil. Surface runoff generated along the slope\nflows into a collection chamber at the end of the flume and then through an outlet hose from which\ndischarges could be measured and samples taken for analysis. Water percolating through the soil was able\nto drain freely from the flume thus avoiding the creation of saturated conditions (Fig 1).\nIn order to increase soil surface moisture conditions, one day prior to each runoff experiment, the\nerosion plot was exposed to simulated rainfall whilst protected with fabric to avoid soil detachment.\nSimulated rainfall was applied to the plots at an intensity of 70 mm h-1 for 45 minutes using a pressure\nirrigation sprinkler. The sprinkler had a nozzle (LECHLER GMbh 56072830-CE) positioned 2 m above\nthe soil surface. Raindrop size ranged between 0.7 mm and 2.8 mm, with a D50 value of 1.2 mm. The\nintensity used in the simulation was high enough to produce runoff, which became constant after 15\nminutes. This intensity corresponds to the 15-min intensity for a 20-year return period storm.\nFor each simulation runoff samples were taken every five minutes. Runoff volumes (including\nwater and sediment) were determined using calibrated measuring cylinders. Sediment concentration in\nrunoff was determined in 1-L aliquots of runoff, which were then decanted and dried at 105\u00baC, and then\nweighed. The organic matter content in the sediments collected in runoff was determined for each sample\nby weight after ignition in a furnace at 550 \uf0b0C for 4h of an aliquot (Nelson and Sommers, 1996). The\nresults were expressed in grams of organic matter per runoff volume. Two simulations and three\nreplications of each analysis were done.\nIn similar plots, cattle slurry was spread onto the soil surface at a rate of 30 Mg ha-1 (7.5 kg\/plot)\nwhich is below the maximum recommended value (MAFF, 1998). Slurry application was done by hand\nbut just left on the surface, simulating the way in which it could be applied by farmers with machinery.\nThe dry solids content of the slurry ranged from 8-24%. In this case, simulated rainfall was applied to the\nplots within 24 h of the slurry application. Runoff samples were collected and managed in the way\ndescribed above to determine sediment and organic matter concentration. In addition, aliquots of 300 mL\nwere collected in sterile bottles to determine the number of PFCs in the runoff following serial dilution\naccording to the membrane filter procedure (method n\u00ba: 9222D, APHA, 1998). The analysis was done\nwithin two hours of the end of the rainfall simulation and each sample was analysed in triplicate.\nPrior to application the number of PFCs present in the slurry was also enumerated. Ten grams of\nmoist slurry was added to 200 mL of sterile water and placed on a mechanical shaker for 20 min. This\nsolution was also serially diluted prior to the membrane filtration.\nA statistical analysis (Duncan\u2019s mean test and one\u2013way analysis of variance) of total runoff\nvolume, average sediment concentration in runoff recorded during the 45 min rainfall, final constant\nrunoff rates and final sediment concentration was done to evaluate significant differences between treated\nand untreated soils, using the Multi range test- Statgraphics 5.1 program.\nResults and Discussion\nRunoff rates and sediment concentrations\nFor the untreated plots runoff started 3 minutes after the beginning of the rainfall and became\nconstant 25 minutes later at a rate of 9 Lmin-1. However, when the slurry was applied on the surface,\nrunoff increased faster in the first phase of the storm, and reached a maximum discharge of 13 Lmin-1,\nwhich represents a depth of 4.7 mm. At the peak 80% of the rainfall ran off. (Fig.2). Total runoff\ncollected during the 45min simulation was 58 \u00b1 4 L in untreated soils and 105 \u00b15 L in treated soil, on\naverage .\nRegarding the soil sediment concentration in runoff, for untreated soils the quantity of material\neroded increased during the first part of the trial until it reached a constant value of about 100 g\/min,\nwhich represented a maximum sediment concentration of about 10 gL-1 (Fig. 3), and an erosion rate of\nabout 0.45 Mg ha-1. A significant linear relationship between soil losses and runoff was observed.\nFor the treated soils, however, the eroded material behaved differently. The highest erosion rates\nwere at the beginning of the experiment and subsequently decreased until rates of about 3 g\/L were\nreached. Total sediment in runoff collected during the 45 min period of simulated rainfall was 30 g in\ntreated soils vs. 346 g in untreated soils, which represented average sediment concentration in runoff of\n2.0 g\/L vs. 7.6 g\/L. Significant differences were confirmed between treated and untreated soils. Table 1\nshows the average value and its standard deviation and the ANOVA.\nThe application of slurry on the soil surface appeared to have a protective effect on the soils,\nreducing erosion but increasing runoff. The repacked soils used in these experiments are likely to have\nlower infiltration rates than undisturbed soils due to a loss of structure. Nevertheless, the flumes were\nprepared in an identical way for each run and therefore we conclude that the differences observed are due\nto the treatment effect.\nEffect of simulated rainfall on transport of organic matter and micro-organisms\nOrganic matter concentrations associated with the sediment collected in the runoff were generally\nhigher in the first 20 minutes of the experiment and declined gradually as the simulation proceeded (Fig.\n4). There were not big differences between simulations. Similar trends were obtained in the three\nreplications.\nThe PFC concentrations found in the runoff water, ranged from 1.9\u00d7 104 to 1.1 \u00d7 106 PFC 100 mL-\n1, depending on the initial concentration in the slurry (for the three simulations they were: 5112, 3118 and\n11697 FC\/g of slurry, respectively), but even during the stages where the concentrations were lower they\nwere always at least one order of magnitude higher than the European standard (2000\/100 mL) given for\nbathing waters. The analysis suggests that faecal coliforms were very mobile in the first fifteen minutes of\nthe experiments but that this rate of transport declined rapidly as the simulation progressed.\nThere were similarities in the pattern of transport of PFCs and organic matter, i.e. a decrease in\nconcentration as the experiment proceeded but there was not a good correlation with total soil loss. There\nis still a lack of understanding of the way in which the micro-organisms are transported: for example the\nproportions adsorbed to mobile and\/or immobile sediments or moving in the flow (Yeghiazarian and\nMontemagno, 2000) or the influence of applying livestock waste on the surface or incorporating the\nwastes into the soil (Quinton, et al., 2003). So, more research is necessary in this area. But the results\nindicate that bacterial transport is more likely to be linked to the slurry organic matter particles than to the\nsoil particles. There was a linear relationship between PFCs and organic sediment (Fig. 5). However, the\nlinear relationship observed between PFCs and organic matter had different slope and intercept values for\neach experimental run, which could be due to the differences in the original concentrations in the slurry or\nother factors not yet elucidated.\nConclusions\nThe application of slurry and manure to the fields has implications for erosion processes. When\nmanure is applied on the soil surface, the quantity of eroded material decreases but runoff can increase by\nup to 30%.\nThis practice implies an important source of pollution for surface waters. If rainfall takes place\nwithin a short period after application, faecal coliforms in runoff waters reach high concentrations,\nespecially during the first phases of the rainfall event. This may cause an increase in the concentration of\nfaecal coliforms in surface water, which could exceed the standards for bathing water quality by more\nthan one order of magnitude. The distribution patterns of PFCs during the rainfall show that most of them\nare transported in association with organic matter particles rather than linked to the soil or suspended in\nwater.\nAcknowledgements\nFinancial support for the project has been provided by the UK Biotechnology and Biological\nSciences Research Council (BBSRC); grant number 63\/MAF12260.\nReferences\nAPHA.
