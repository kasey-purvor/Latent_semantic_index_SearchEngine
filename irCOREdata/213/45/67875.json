Heinz Holliger. ECM New Series 476 3225.\nAs a composer Heinz Holliger has remained \nprolific in the ten years since Tempo ran a sixti-\neth birthday profile. This summer the Lucerne \nFestival was staging the premi\u00e8re of  the a-cap-\npella chorus Rosa Loui, as well as Holliger\u2019s Three \nSketches for violin and viola, a new oboe quartet \nand recent choral settings of  12 poems by David \nRokeah. Meanwhile ECM Records have issued a \nfine recording of  Romancendres, first performed at \nLucerne in 2003, and Ges\u00e4nge der Fr\u00fche for choir, \norchestra and tape, sub-titled \u2018nach Schumann \nand H\u00f6lderlin\u2019.\nGes\u00e4nge der Fr\u00fche dates from 1987, and its \nappearance on disc is particularly welcome. \nHolliger has described the work as \u2018almost too per-\nsonal\u2019, but it is this personal element which makes \nit so fascinating. Like the Two Liszt Transcriptions \nfor orchestra directly preceding it, the four-move-\nment piece enters into a modern dialogue with \nan artistic idol from the Romantic era. To a cer-\ntain extent Holliger\u2019s Ges\u00e4nge der Fr\u00fche, too, \nwas inspired by a musical source \u2013 in this case \nSchumann\u2019s late piano pieces of  the same title, op. \n133. Schumann himself  had thought of  incorpo-\nrating in his title the name of  Diotima, the distant \nbeloved of  the similarly unhinged Romantic poet \nFriedrich H\u00f6lderlin. Subsequently he dedi-\ncated the pieces to Bettina von Arnim, a literary \nbluestocking who witnessed both Schumann\u2019s \nmental turmoil and that of  H\u00f6lderlin, half  a \ncentury earlier.\nHolliger\u2019s first movement offers a choral ver-\nsion of  the first piece from Schumann\u2019s op. 133 \nand the melody of  No. 5 in the set. This is married \nwith a spring poem by H\u00f6lderlin (not one of  the \npair Holliger used in his Scardanelli-Zyklus). The \nmovement also incorporates a theme from the \nF\u2013A\u2013E Sonata ( jointly composed in October 1853 \nfor Joseph Joachim by Schumann, Albert Dietrich \nand the young Brahms) and the recitation of  two \ntexts by Bettina von Arnim, the second addressed \nto Clara Schumann. The second movement fea-\ntures H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s \u2018An Elysium\u2019 and autopsy reports \non the brains of  Robert Schumann and H\u00f6lderlin \nrespectively. In the next movement Schumann\u2019s \nop. 133 No. 1 reappears on tape, together with \nHolliger\u2019s vocal setting of  the \u2018Diotima\u2019 poems. \nThe finale draws on further verses and quota-\ntions from H\u00f6lderlin. As the work unfolds, the \nmusical referencing multiplies: a choral setting \nof  Schumann\u2019s op. 133, No. 5, other reminiscenc-\nes of  that opus and snatches of  the Nachtlied op. \n108, the melodrama Manfred and the late \u2018Geister-\nVariationen\u2019. There\u2019s also a chorale (\u2018Wenn mein \nSt\u00fcndlein vorhanden ist\u2019) that Schumann com-\nposed in the sanatorium in Endenich. Some of  \nthese ingredients are more covert than others; the \nabove account is indebted to Holliger\u2019s biogra-\npher Kristina Ericson.\nHolliger\u2019s ear for expressive sonority was \nnever keener than here. The work begins, pianis-\nsimo, on strings and cymbals, using all 12 notes \nof  the chromatic scale. The ending is equally \nethereal: following a great climax for the choir \nand orchestra, a humming chorus of  sopranos \nand altos is underlaid by a vibrating temple-bell. \nIn between, the human voices and instrumental \nchoirs weave music of  lyrical richness and depth. \nProduced in collaboration with Thomas Kessler, \nthe pre-recorded tape includes an out-of-tune \npiano played by Holliger. According to Roman \nBrotbeck\u2019s booklet note, this recalls a square piano \nin H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s T\u00fcbingen asylum. Schumann, how-\never, used just such an instrument on which to \nwrite his Endenich chorale, thereby reinforcing \nthe biographical associations.\nThe tape features the actor Bruno Ganz as the \nvoice of  Schumann,1 Serena Wey as Bettina von \nArnim and Michael Maassen as the two forensic \nexaminers. The most arresting effects are those \ncreated to evoke a pen\u2019s scratching and scrap-\ning. Schumann has the last words: \u2018Nun will ich \nschlie\u00dfen. Es dunkelt schon\u2019 (\u2018I shall close now. It \nis already getting dark\u2019), from his letter to Joseph \nJoachim written shortly before his suicide attempt. \nAlmost needless to say, Holliger interprets the \nremark in a metaphorical sense. But ultimately, \nfor all the verbal play and musical cryptography, \nhis memento mori elicits a ready sympathy for the \ntwo artists celebrated here.\n 1  Ganz (the unforgettable Hitler of  Oliver Hirschbiegel\u2019s \nDownfall) long ago recorded a disc of  readings from H\u00f6lderlin \nfor ECM (New Series 823 643-2, issued 1984). (Ed.)\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ntempo78\nIn 1893 Clara Schumann burned the man-\nuscript of  her husband\u2019s five Romances for \ncello and piano, composed 40 years earlier. \nBrahms approved of  the deed, maintaining that \nSchumann had produced various pieces that \nwere \u2018hardly worth publishing\u2019. Yet Joachim had \nresponded with great enthusiasm to the copy of  \nthe Romanzen he was sent in the month of  their \ncompletion. Romancendres sets out to atone for \nwhat Holliger regards as an act of  vandalism. His \nwork is made up of  four short movements framed \nby two miniature funeral marches. A nocturne \n(\u2018Aurora\u2019) with a gorgeous cantabile passage goes \nbefore Schumann\u2019s derangement, the instru-\nments now simulating wings wildly flapping. The \nthird movement, headed \u2018The Avenging Angel \nof  the Present\u2019, evokes Schumann in sanguine \nmood \u2013 the Florestan mood, one could say. Then \nan animated exercise in trills picks up on one of  \nthe characteristics of  the Romances described by \nJoachim. Other, less prominent devices suggest \nthe aged Clara and Johannes.\nUnlike, for example, Elliott Carter in his \nCello Sonata of  1948, Heinz Holliger\u2019s writing \nencourages a convergence of  cello and piano. \nThese latter-day embers of  lost Romances are \nvigorously stoked by Christoph Richter and \nD\u00e9nes V\u00e1rjon, who also perform a transcription \nof  Clara Schumann\u2019s Three Violin Romances. \nShould Holliger be minded to pursue this vein \nof  cinder music in some form, then Robert \nWalser\u2019s Aschenbr\u00f6del \u2013 a companion to the Snow \nWhite drama composed by Holliger in 1997\u201398 \n\u2013 awaits him. \nPeter Palmer \nrichard barrett: Opening of  the Mouth. elision \nEnsemble. ABC Classics 476 3174.\nTo be blunt: Richard Barrett\u2019s Opening of  the \nMouth is one of  the most important compositions \nof  the last 20 years, and this reissued recording \nis an essential purchase.2 The piece was written \nfor ELISION, and few other groups possess the \nrequired skills and instrumentarium to attempt a \nrival release.\nOpening\u2019s complex construction comprises six \noverlapping movements (a seventh, an extended \nelectronic prelude played before live performanc-\nes, is not included on this disc), three of  which \n\u2013 Engf\u00fchrung I, Schneebett and Engf\u00fchrung II \u2013 con-\ntain complete or fragmented versions of  solos or \nduos that may be performed separately (three of  \nthese have been recorded by ELISION on NMC \nD117). A useful diagram in the sleeve-notes helps \nwith orientation. \nThis overlaying gives Opening considerable \npolyphonic depth anchored to a strong sense of  \nharmonic and rhythmic coordination, to which \nELISION give careful attention. This is estab-\nlished by the first four vibraphone chords of  the \npercussion solo abglanzbeladen\/auseinanderge-\nschrieben, which describe a curve as self-contained \nand clear as any classical cadence, and reinforced \nby the series of  seven tone-centres that shapes the \nsecond section. Thus, despite the extravagance \nof  the solo writing, one feels the music strapped \nto the teeth of  a giant machine. This would be a \nmonstrous image were it not for the filigree flour-\nishes that burst between the cracks, tiny moments \nof  human brilliance and resistance, played and \nrecorded here with absolute precision. They \nmight be read as extraordinary products of  coa-\nlescence, the fleeting potentialities of  the system. \nTheir possibility is written deep within Barrett\u2019s \nhypermetrical complexities, waiting to be uncov-\nered and squeezed out.\nBy the fourth section, Largo, scored for soprano, \nkoto and cello, that depth has been compressed to \njust three polyphonic lines, each distinctly charac-\nterized and now operating within no discernible \nharmonic or imitative framework. The individual \nlines \u2013 as a result of  the music written for them and \nof  the instruments\u2019 intrinsic qualities (an insepa-\nrable alloy in Barrett\u2019s music) \u2013 are in one aspect \nextremely fragile, but at the same time generate \nenough strength to bear the structural weight of  \nwhat has gone before and open plenty of  doors \nto future possibilities. There is a dialogue here, \nor at least a forceful questioning of  assumptions, \nbetween states and agencies of  musical power: \ngreat structural weight is placed not upon massed \nstrings or brass, but upon the delicate koto; an \ninstrument that \u2013 again contrary to more familiar \norchestral tropes \u2013 is generally heard by Western \nears as ornamental exoticism.\nThe reduction of  rhetorical flair continues still \nfurther in Schneebett. The most remote and self-\neffacing of  the movements so far, it functions as \nthe ultimate collapse or landing of  the denser \nstructures that have preceded it. This withdrawal \nis also a slow penetration, as though the listener is \nbeing led through a series of  curtains into a silent \ninner sanctuary or operating theatre. The resonant \nacoustic in which this CD has been recorded is \nimportant: it allows the sounds to drip with mois-\nture, giving a sense of  space inhabited.

Barrett\u2019s \nsounds, however, all squelches, rasps and running \nfluid, have an organic texture that encourages the \near not to contrast electronic with acoustic, but to \nreflect on certain physical, fleshy continuities in \nthe creation and reception of  sounds themselves.\nWhen human agency returns, in the long \nEngf\u00fchrung II movement, it is both unmediated \n(mezzo-soprano) and mediated (percussion, \nelectric guitar, sampler). The potential suggest-\ned in Zungenentwurzeln is passed once more to \nthe unpredictable interactions of  lips, fingers, \nmouthpiece, keys, wood and strings; sections of  \nthe score \u2013 until now obsessively detailed \u2013 give \nway to guided improvisation, another string on \nELISION\u2019s bow. \nThese interactions extend beyond the physi-\ncal act of  producing a sound. A clarinet solo acts \nupon a voice, a vibraphone stretches voices and \nelectronics taut. The musical objects \u2013 solos and \nchamber works each with independent lives of  \ntheir own \u2013 interact as human beings do, some-\ntimes passive, sometimes active. We recall the \nbreath and sinew that is music making, and that \nthe interactions recorded here are both symboli-\ncally and actually interactions between human \nbeings. The musicians of  ELISION are not only \ntheatrical representations of  human adventure \nand endurance, they are also doing it for real. \nI don\u2019t mean to suggest here any sort of  pro-\ngramme. In spite of  localized consistencies, \nBarrett\u2019s music works constantly to undo expec-\ntations and pattern recognition. What audible \nstructure there is in Engf\u00fchrung II derives from \nfragmented versions of  solo works for clarinet, \nviolin and cello, shuffled together and augment-\ned with parts from elsewhere in the ensemble. \nAlthough there are carefully arranged continui-\nties that maintain the movement\u2019s coherence, \nthe sorts of  assertions that are necessary for nar-\nrating a programme are impossible. To talk in \nsuch terms is to grant the music certainties \u2013 of  \ncharacterization, scenario, conflict and resolution \n\u2013 that it manifestly avoids on every audible level. \nELISION\u2019s recording of  Opening of  the Mouth \ndoesn\u2019t present a model of  humanity, but draws \nout some of  its expressive potential from threat-\nening and darkened surroundings; its touch upon \nour own skin and eardrums is miraculous.

Naxos 8.559614 with DVD 2.110256. \nBoth these discs were intended as part of  the \nwidespread celebration of  the Carter Centennial, \nthe second more explicitly so, and they offer \n(with a certain amount of  overlap between the \ntwo discs) a crop of  relatively recent smaller \npieces for solo instruments or small ensembles \nanchored by larger and more substantial works. \nCarter\u2019s smaller-scaled works started in the 1980s \nas a trickle amidst much larger pieces, and have \nbecome increasingly more prevalent over the \nyears, mostly as birthday and memorial tributes to \nfriends \u2013 often composers \u2013 but also as works for \nthe world-class performers who have championed \nCarter\u2019s music. \nThe music of  composers who survive into \nold age and continue to write usually undergoes \nsome sort of  qualitative change. Although the \ndimensions of  his works remained more or less \nthe same, in his old age Verdi turned to comedy \nfor the first time in his mature career. Vaughan \nWilliams\u2019s later works were suddenly brimming \nwith new and vivid instrumental color, allied \nwith an expanded tonal and harmonic sense. The \nmusic of  Stravinsky\u2019s last period, aside from being \n12-tone, displayed a greatly increased concentra-\ntion and compression of  substance, texture, and \ntime-scale. (Although there is probably not much \nelse that they have in common, both Vaughan \nWilliams and Stravinsky, in their last major scores \n\u2013 the Ninth Symphony and Requiem Canticles, \nrespectively \u2013 produced works of  summation \nthat seem to be continually referencing their ear-\nlier music.) Virgil Thomson, reflecting an older \nperson\u2019s reluctance to spend too much time by \nhimself  or to expend too much stamina at a time, \nreturned to an earlier practice of  writing musical \nportraits of  people who would sit in a room with \nhim for an hour at a time. Arthur Berger, having \nconceded that the world at large wasn\u2019t particular-\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ntempo80\nly interested in music, stopped writing new music; \nalthough, being unwilling to completely give up \non composition, he began to re-write his pieces, \nbut recasting and altering them so they became \nvirtually new works. Strauss, Faur\u00e9, and Brahms \nalso offer striking examples of  stylistic changes in \nthe last stages of  their careers. \nCarter\u2019s later career has been marked not only \nby an increase in shorter, smaller-scaled works but \nalso, generally, by a change in both the density of  \nthe music and the scope and complexity of  the \ninitial generating idea and its development. (The \nSinfonia: sum fluxae pretium spei, Carter\u2019s longest \nsingle work, from 1996, is in some ways an excep-\ntion to this trend, and in others not.) Whereas in \nan earlier phase Carter would say, \nI\u2019ve lots of  ideas about writing for the orchestra and do \nlike to have time and the incentive to put them down, \nbut it\u2019s a terrible lot of  thought, imaginative effort \nand just plain note writing. I limit myself  to a small \nnumber of  orchestral pieces \u2026 \nby the mid 1980s, his attitude was, \nI am continually thinking of  musical possibilities, of  \nshort motivic figures, chord progressions, trying over \nin my head all sort of  musical textures and colors. \nSometimes one of  these seems particularly interesting, \nand then I begin to think how it could be led into and \naway from, and soon a whole section of  a piece begins \nto form itself  \u2026 with each piece I try to do something \ndifferent because I like to be involved in the piece and \ntake chances with it, not knowing at first where it will \nlead or how it will turn out. To me, it\u2019s like going on an \nexpedition to a place where I have not been.3\nThese shorter works, displaying a staggering \nprofusion of  materials, expressive characters, \ninstrumental textures, narrative strategies, and \nmusical realizations are evidence of  a vivid musi-\ncal imagination, worthy of  comparison with \nthat of  Haydn. The solo works, Scrivo in Vento, \nGra, Figments I and II, Steep Steps, Riconoscenza per \nGoffredo Petrassi, and Rhapsodic Musings all have \nin common their presentation of  clearly deline-\nated contrasting materials whose interactions, \neither cooperative or confrontational, or both in \nturn, are the substance of  the formal trajectory \nof  the work. \nThe Cello Sonata (1947\u201348), which is the major \npiece on the Johannes Martens Ensemble disc and \nthe oldest work on either disc, was, along with \nthe Piano Sonata of  two years earlier, the harbin-\nger of  what one might call Carter\u2019s mature style, \nwhich conclusively arrived with the First String \nQuartet in 1951. The beginning idea of  the Sonata \nis that the manner of  sound production of  the two \ninstruments is irreconcilable and that those differ-\nences should be featured rather than hidden. This \nidea, which is at the same time abstract and com-\npletely grounded in a simple aural reality, leads to \nthe development of  distinct thematic material and \nthe projection of  different senses of  the movement \nof  time for the two instruments, and thus gener-\nates a continuously unfolding, intensely dramatic \nform that eventually comes full circle, but with \nthose instrumental characteristics and materials \nreversed. Enchanted Preludes of  1988 starts with \nan idea both similar and contrary to that of  the \nsonata: the two instruments, a wind and a string, \nmimic each other\u2019s characteristic sonic and articu-\nlative qualities, creating a continuously-fused airy \ntextural web while maintaining separate and dis-\ntinctive intervallic and rhythmic vocabularies. Con \nLeggerezza Pensosa, for clarinet, violin, and cello \n\u2013 whose title, drawn from the writings of  its dedi-\ncatee, Italo Calvino, which means \u2018lightness of  \nthoughtfulness\u2019, might serve as a description of  \nthe manner of  all these later pieces \u2013 also builds \nits form from the differentiated sonic, rhythmic, \nand intervallic characteristics of  the three instru-\nments, but in this case treating them as parts of  a \nlarger meta-instrument which subsumes them all, \nthe form being the dramatic curve of  their fusions \nand oppositions. Fragments I and II (1994 and 1999, \nrespectively) and the Elegy of  1946 are brief  textur-\nal essays which stand as pendants to the five string \nquartets which, as a unit, stand as a major compo-\nnent of  Carter\u2019s output. \nThe major works on the New Music Concerts \nEnsemble disc are Mosaic (2005) for harp and seven \ninstruments and Dialogues (2004) for piano and 18 \ninstruments. Mosaic, which is a tribute to Carlos \nSalzedo, harpist and composer, who was one of  \nthe ultramodernists composers who were influ-\nential on Carter during his early years, explores \nmany of  the innovative harp-playing techniques \ndeveloped by Salzedo through a series of  short \nepisodes described by Carter as being like tesser-\nae (the individual stones making up a mosaic.) \nDialogues is the first of  three late works (the others \nbeing Soundings of  2005 and Interventions of  2007) \nexploring the conversational and sometimes con-\nfrontational relationship between solo piano and \na large instrumental ensemble. \nAlthough all of  the performances on both discs \nare, to say the least, completely above reproach, \nthe most memorable is that of  the Cello Sonata \nby Johannes Martens and Joachim Kjelsaas \n 3 Both of  these quotations, the first from a 1973 interview with \nStuart Liebman in the Boston Phoenix, and the second from an \ninterview at the Banff  Center with Robert Johnston, Michael \nCentury, Robert J.

In general the lingering \nimpression of  the performances of  the Johannes \nMartens ensemble is of  the strongly vivid instru-\nmental color of  their performances (in the case of  \nthe early gentle Elegy, perhaps to its detriment), \nbut the performances of  the members of  the New \nMusic Concerts Ensemble are also uniformly \nstrongly expressive and musically satisfying.

It is \npredominantly serious in tone (although there are \nnotable exceptions, including Touchstone (1967), \na humorous orchestral portrait of  the clown in \nShakespeare\u2019s As You Like It) and frequently atonal, \nbut with an almost classical concern with form \nand proportion. \nThe earliest piece on the disc, the Third String \nQuartet of  1958, is a key work and something of  a \nwatershed for the composer as he suppressed most \nof  his predominantly tonal compositions written \nbefore it. It won him the McEwen Composition \nPrize in 1959 and marked a move to a more chro-\nmatic and dissonant style. The opening Allegro \nagitato begins with a statement of  the four-note \nmotif  from which the material of  the whole work \nis derived. The eloquent second subject presents \ngenuinely purposeful dialogue between all four \nvoices and this sense of  intimate discourse is \nmaintained in the Lento central movement, with \nits mainly fugal unfolding. In the central episode \nof  the finale, Wilson suspends development of  the \ninitial ideas to interpose a fugal-style scherzo. This \nfinely-wrought piece receives a deeply satisfying \nperformance from the Edinburgh Quartet, who \nrecorded the composer\u2019s Fourth String Quartet \n(1978) for Meridian Records in 2001. \nWilson\u2019s Piano Sonata was originally written \nin 1959, then set aside and revised in 1964. Like \nBeethoven\u2019s final contribution to the genre, it is \nin two movements, of  which the second is a set \nof  wide-ranging variations. Characteristically, \nthe Adagio introduction to the first movement \ncontains the germinal ideas of  the whole work, \nincluding the key interval of  a tritone. An increase \nin tempo to Allegro potente signals the arrival of  \nthe main body of  the movement, which contrasts \nsteely, vigorously dramatic material with a calm-\ner, but more unsettled second subject. The slow \nmovement\u2019s seven linked variations are strongly \ncontrasting and include a puckish scherzo. Simon \nSmith responds magnificently to the considerable \ntechnical challenges of  the opening movement \nand proceeds to bring out the individual character \nof  each variation. \nThe one-movement piano trio (1966) falls into \nseven clearly defined sections, of  which the first \nprovides an extended dialogue for strings and \npiano alternately and the second is a dynamic \nAllegro in which the instruments are heard togeth-\ner for the first time. The third part, a cadenza for \nsolo cello, leads to the fourth, a scherzo in which \nall the instruments again take part. The fifth sec-\ntion is a cadenza for solo violin, while the sixth \nis a lyrical elegiac movement which ultimately \nleads to a coda, in which the music of  the open-\ning is briefly revisited before the work comes to \na hushed conclusion. Whereas the sonata\u2019s key \ninterval was a tritone, it is Shostakovich\u2019s musical \nsignature of  D\u2013S\u2013C\u2013H which haunts the Piano \nTrio. Pianist Simon Smith with Tristan Gurney \nand Mark Bailey of  the Edinburgh Quartet do full \njustice to both the intensity and the lyricism of  \nthis searching piece. \nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ntempo82\nWilson frequently used one composition as a \nspringboard to a subsequent work: the solo piano \npiece Incunabula (1983) originated in the piano \npart of  a cycle of  seven \u2018songs from the Chinese\u2019, \nThe Willow Branches, and in turn furnished mate-\nrial for the Piano Concerto (1984), written for \nDavid Wilde. The title might be freely translated \nas \u2018getting back to basics\u2019 and it represented an \nelement of  re-thinking by the composer of  some \nof  the possibilities of  musical form. It consists of  \nan unfolding series of  developing musical ideas or \nprisms, which are subtly connected. A haunting \npiece, it is substantial enough to be regarded as a \nsingle-movement sonata, though perhaps Wilson \nconsidered its evolution too instinctive and its \nstructure too fluid to qualify for that genre. It \ntakes in an introductory fantasy, a scherzo, a dark \nnocturne and ends in an extended ethereal Molto \nAdagio section which gradually fades away. Simon \nSmith has the measure of  its elusive, occasionally \nhallucinatory character. \nThe two short works for solo guitar are nota-\nble for their naturally idiomatic writing for the \ninstrument (a concerto followed in 1996). The \nThree Pieces for guitar, which date from 1961, are \nbased on a 12-note series and vividly expression-\nist in tone; they consist of  a scherzando-like moto \nperpetuo, a lyrical Lento and a rhapsodic Moderato. \nThe later Cancion (1977) has a freely improvisa-\ntory quality, almost song-like in its spontaneous \neloquence. Both works are sensitively and imagi-\nnatively rendered by Allan Neave. \nDelphian are to be warmly congratulated \nfor bringing these tough but elegant, closely \nargued and well crafted works to a wider public \nwith superbly committed performances in vivid \nrecordings. Astonishingly, this is the first CD \ndevoted entirely to Wilson\u2019s music since a \nChandos disc containing his Piano Concerto and \nIntroit appeared over 20 years ago. It is to be hoped \nthat record companies will lose no time in seeking \nout more of  his music, including such impres-\nsive large-scale works as the one-act radio opera \nThe Charcoal Burner (1968), the Missa pro Mundo \nConturbato (1970), the Sequentiae Passionis (1971) \nfor chorus and orchestra, the three-act opera The \nConfessions of  a Justified Sinner (1974) commis-\nsioned by Scottish Opera, the Viola Concerto \n(1987), the Fourth Symphony, subtitled Passeleth \nTapestry (1988), the Violin Concerto (1993) and the \nFifth Symphony (1998), the composer\u2019s last major \npiece before his death, at the age of  73, in 2001. \nPaul Conway\n\u2018UBS Soundscapes: Pioneers\u2019.

Thomas\u2019s novel \u2018The White \nHotel\u2019, in particular by the dreamy poem near the \nstart of  the book. It is short (5\u201923\u201d) \u2013 something \nwhich, to the composer, meant monothemati-\ncism. Even in this small frame, however, there is a \nfeeling of  inevitable growth from the hazy open-\ning (a direct response to the poem) to the final \nouting of  the sky\u2019s blaze. \nJoe Duddell has been influenced by bands \nsuch as Radiohead and New Order. His Azalea \nFragments (after Patrick Heron) is the composer\u2019s \ntribute to the eponymous painter and is a reaction \nto the painting \u2018Azalea Gardens\u2019 at the Tate at St. \nIves. It depicts, clearly, the emotions felt on see-\ning the blaze of  colour for the first time. Duddell\u2019s \nlanguage can be clearly based in the music of  the \nEnglish Conservatives, but is not limited to them. \nIn contrast to the near-Impressionist atmos-\npherics of  Duddell comes the clear high jinks of  \nMartin Suckling\u2019s The Moon, The Moon (2007). \nThe composer\u2019s stated intention was to write \nsomething that \u2018felt like an overture\u2019 and, in \nits bright colours and passages of  held-breath \nexpectancy, it succeeds. There is a light orches-\ntrational touch that could almost be described as \npost-Mendelssohnian, and if  Edward Lear\u2019s Owl \nand the Pussycat is the stated referand, the spirit \nof  Shakespeare\u2019s Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream is \nalso invoked. \nJason Yarde\u2019s Rude Awakening (2006) is an \nattempt to capture an event that actually could \nhappen within three minutes. The piece moves \nfrom the comfort of  early morning to alarum \n(alarm clock) and the panic of  only having two \nminutes to be where you need to be. Yarde comes \nfrom a jazz background, both as performer and \ncomposer, and one can hear this in the syncopa-\ntions. This is his first piece for full symphony \norchestra.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ncd reviews 83\nFinally, Helen Grime\u2019s Virga.

Dutton Epoch \nCDLX 7212 (2 CD-set for the price of  one).\n \nWe are now being regularly treated to additions \nto Dutton\u2019s British music series, and this one is \nanother absolute triumph. It is immensely gratify-\ning to see real attention being devoted to Arthur \nButterworth (b. 1923), who continues to make \nsuch a unique and immeasurable contribution to \nBritish symphonic literature. His Symphony No. \n4 (1986) is a swirling, Heathcliffian landscape of  \nlong, dark swathes of  Pennine moorland under \nwintry skies. The epic grandeur of  Butterworth\u2019s \norchestral canvases are counterbalanced by an \nintensely emotional inner language: as with his \nidol Sibelius, this language finds voice in long and \nexpressive lyrical passages where the different \norchestral divisions are deployed with great skill \nand clarity. Listen to the long, slow third move-\nment (echoes of  Tapiola and Pelleas and Melisande) \nand you will hear what I mean. Everything sounds \nright, and the intensity is often at its greatest \nwhen solo instruments (often violin and oboe, \nbut maybe a clarinet, or even a brace of  clarinets) \nare cast in dialogue with one another, sometimes \nunderscored by a shimmering, tritonic harp \narpeggio. We are privileged to have the composer \nconducting his own music: what 85-year-old could \nmatch the clarity of  focus and brilliance of  attack \nand dramatic energy he brings to this recording? \nThe commitment is total and never flags for a \nmoment of  its 43 minutes. We are also fortunate \nin having Butterworth\u2019s own sleeve notes.\nEvery bit as impressive and equally grand \nin scale is the Viola Concerto op. 82 (1992), also \nplaying at nearly 40 minutes. (Butterworth has \nalso completed a Cello Concerto and a Violin \nConcerto, the latter broadcast by Nigel Kennedy.) \nThe Viola Concerto is another wondrous addi-\ntion to the repertoire (which is hardly large) and \nis in a more serene and intimate vein than the \nSymphony. The opening clarion horn calls palely \nrecall Vaughan Williams Fifth Symphony and the \nmusic follows long, poetic lines: the viola\u2019s sultry \ntone weaving and plaiting threads of  restrained \nlove and subdued longing. A beautiful extended \ncadenza asks many questions to which the orches-\ntra gradually assembles its muted and ambiguous \nresponses. \nIf  Symphony No. 4 is \u2018Wuthering Heights\u2019, \nSymphony No. 1 is \u2018Rain, Steam, and Speed\u2019. \nThe very stormy first movement cites references \nto Sibelius\u2019s Sixth Symphony. The influence is \nacknowledged by the composer in his interesting \n27-minute talk which concludes the first disc, in \nwhich he discusses his early life, war service and \nother formative personalities, including Vaughan \nWilliams and Barbirolli. Butterworth describes \nhow the piece was begun in the late 1940s and \nemerged gradually over the succeeding seven \nyears. The final movement\u2019s structure was inspired \nby the moto perpetuo concept of  a chamber work by \nLeonard Salzedo. The recording we are presented \nwith here is the remastered version of  Barbirolli\u2019s \nown live performance at the 1958 Proms, the year \nafter he conducted the work\u2019s first performance. \nBe prepared for a rather rugged sound quality: \nBarbirolli\u2019s 34-minute reading compares interest-\ningly with Douglas Bostock\u2019s 40 minutes for the \nClassico label made a few years ago (CLASSCD \n274). This was Butterworth\u2019s first really impor-\ntant piece and we are lucky this rare document has \nsurvived. The Hall\u00e9 are clearly in full assimilation \nof  the Butterworth idiom and even if  clarity of  \ndetail is sometimes a bit hard to come by, the dark \natmosphere of  this live broadcast is as insistent \nand compelling as the sudden shafts of  light which \neerily brighten the landscape.\nThis is a most generous helping of  rich treas-\nure. The next instalment with the recent Fifth \nSymphony (2003 \u2013 Butterworth has recently \ncompleted a Sixth) and a number of  shorter \norchestral pieces is very keenly awaited. Many \nof  Butterworth\u2019s 130 or so works will also be dis-\ncussed in a forthcoming book about him by my \nfellow contributor Paul Conway. This release is \nan absolute must.

Altarus AIR-\nCD-9027.\nIn his informative CD notes, the Northern Irish \ncomposer Simon Mawhinney (b. 1976) states \nthat \u2018What interests me is what Morton Feldman \ncalled the \u201cabstract experience\u201d. Music takes us \non a journey. In writing music I want to travel as \nfar as possible. Compositions are like postcards\u2019. \nMawhinney\u2019s travelling companions on this disc \nare the pianist Mary Dullea and violinist Darrah \nMorgan; Morgan\u2019s lectures on extended technique \nled to Barcode III, and the remaining works on the \ndisc were written for the respective performers.\nHunshigo was originally intended as a ten-\nminute lyrical vehicle for Morgan and Dullea: the \nend result was some 45 minutes long. Unlike the \nother two works on the disc, virtuosity is not fore-\ngrounded (although it clearly is required). Rather, \nit consists of  a series of  broad paragraphs, often \nlyrical and evocative, in which sounds are allowed \nto run their own course. Sustaining a medita-\ntion of  this nature for three-quarters of  an hour \nis no simple matter, for both performer and lis-\ntener. Certainly, there are arresting and beautiful \nmoments, and the individual sections hold one\u2019s \nattention, but I found it impossible to grasp the \nwork\u2019s dimensions as a whole. In its depth and \nlevel of  detail, this is more of  a traveller\u2019s guide \nthan a postcard, and as such offers a host of  inter-\nesting areas to explore.\nThe remaining works are shorter and more \ndirect. Barcode III for violin explores virtuos-\nity and extended techniques, not least through \nMawhinney\u2019s interest in Middle Eastern music. A \nvariety of  contrasting ideas, often in dialogue, help \naccumulate energy leading to a climax. Inspired \nby the experience of  climbing hundreds of  steps \nto a Hindu Shrine in Kuala Lumpur, the first work \non the disc, Batu for solo piano, starts off  with \nskittish, rapid figuration over long-sustained bass \nnotes. The pianist is required to play much of  this \nfiguration with a light touch that can result in cer-\ntain notes failing to sound. As the work progresses, \nmaterial appears in a more moderate tempo; the \nsuperimposition of  different apparent tempi gives \nthe work a sense of  space and grandeur. Somehow \nthe pianist Mary Dullea finds extra fingers to play \nincreasingly florid arabesques, creating washes of  \nsound that get increasingly ecstatic as the work \nbuilds to an elaborate and sonorous climax. The \nhushed ending questions the nature of  the expe-\nrience, though one is left in no doubt about the \nseriousness of  Mawhinney\u2019s art.\nEdward Venn\ng\u00f3reckI: \u2018Life Journey\u2019.

Performers and record \ncompany have combined eloquently to create \na new recording named Life Journey, covering an \nimaginative selection of  his music, ranging from \nintimate, lesser-known, pieces of  his student days, \nto more recent works for larger ensemble \u2013 includ-\ning several world premi\u00e8re recordings. \nEver since the unique presentation of  his highly \nrenowned Third Symphony, Symphony of  Sorrow-\nful Songs, when Dawn Upshaw linked with the \nLondon Sinfonietta, selling over one million copies \nof  that profound tour de force, G\u00f3recki has com-\nposed much music that has rarely been heard. On \nthis new recording, 17 soloists, including strings, \nbrass, woodwind, percussion, 2 pianists and man-\ndolin, communicate a charismatic assortment of  \nworks that possess immense style and character, \nranging from the poignant Two Sacred Songs, for \npiano and baritone, to the riveting Requiem f\u00fcr Eine \nPolka for piano and 13 instruments.\nSoon after Stephen de Pledge and Ronan \nCollett (baritone) present an intense account of  \nhis Two Sacred Songs, Chamber Domaine rekindle \nan earlier example of  G\u00f3recki\u2019s energetic muscu-\nlarity, as Stephen combines with Evelina Puzaite \nto present the Toccata For Two Pianos, with \ncompelling dynamism.

KAIROS 0012842KAI \nBeat Furrer (born 1954) studied composition with \nHaubenstock-Ramati in Vienna; he also founded \nKlangforum Wien. His Piano Concerto is a work \nthat searches for new directions in sound. Furrer \nstates that he is concerned with \u2018maintaining the \nplasticity of  the piano sound\u2019. The piano itself  is \nthe \u2018centre of  gravity\u2019, while the orchestra ampli-\nfies around it. Furrer initially concentrates on \nthe lower register of  the piano, and experiments \nwith silently fingering low notes and activating \nthem via higher registers (presumably inspired \nby Schoenberg\u2019s op. 11). On a pitch\/timbral level, \nthe work moves progressively towards the higher \nregisters, in the process sounding increasingly \nmetallic. In the centre of  this journey lies a central \nslow haven.\nNicolas Hodges, along with Rolf  Hind and \nIan Pace, has long held a special place in the per-\nformance of  contemporary piano music. His \ncontribution is superbly assured. The concerto \ndissolves upwards rather than ends per se, and out \nof  the crystal sound of  the piano\u2019s extreme upper \nregister emerges Petra Hoffmann\u2019s high soprano \nintertwining with Eva Furrer\u2019s contrabass flute \nin invocation VI. This is the sixth scene of  Furrer\u2019s \ninvocation, an opera based on Margaret Duras\u2019s \nnovel moderato cantabile that begins with the inter-\nruption of  a child\u2019s piano lesson by screams of  \ndeath. Hoffmann\u2019s control is breathtaking. Furrer \ntakes a text by Juan de la Cruz, an invocation of  \nChrist as Bridgeroom to the Soul, exploring multi-\nple meanings of  the text, from yearning to rapture \nand torment.\nSpur (\u2018pathway\u2019, 1998) for string quartet and \npiano, layers repeated patterns to give an impres-\nsion of  constant \u2013 although not unstoppable \n\u2013 motion. As with the Piano Concerto, the piece \nprogresses upwards in pitch as it unfolds; strings, \nalso, are increasingly foregrounded. Furrer plays \nwith the created forward motion, interrupting it \nunexpectedly, forcing it to flow around the caesu-\nrae. The performance is outstanding.\nMarie Luise Maintz\u2019s booklet note, \n\u2018Physiognomy of  the Scream\u2019, traces the impor-\ntance of  the scream as an \u2018extreme dimension of  \nexpressivity\u2019; also, as a prelingual sound, it reflects \nFurrer\u2019s interest in the boundary area between \nlanguage and music. Scream is most evident at the \nopening of  the 2005 theatre piece FAMA, based \non Arthur Schnitzler\u2019s Fr\u00e4ulein Elsa, which begins \nwith collective screaming (Kairos 0012562KAI). \nWhat is offered here is the sixth scene, for voice \nand bass flute, a scene underpinned by the protag-\nonist\u2019s fear. The disjunct expression, frequently \nwhispered, is counterpointed by the flute\u2019s reac-\ntions. The 1984 piano trio retour an mich includes \nan instrumental scream (fff tone clusters in the \nmiddle section). Furrer composes in a spiral form, \ncircling round an imaginary centre. The glassy \nsounds of  the concerto recur in the frozen, frigid \nexchanges of  thirds between strings and piano at \nthe work\u2019s centre.\nLot\u00f3fagos means \u2018Lotus eater\u2019 and refers to \nOdysseus\u2019 companions who ate lotus to forget. \nFurrer plays with the concept of  memory. The \nscoring might imply registral space (and indeed \nthis is exploited), but the fascinating sound of  \ndouble-bass harmonics against solo voice actually \nputs the two soloists in the same register, interact-\ning, as a prime gesture. \nColin Clarke\nsofia gubaidulina: Complete works for solo piano. \nMarcela Roggeri (pno).

The exploration of  the timbral potentials of  \nthe piano and the expressive effect caused by the \njuxtaposition of  contrasting styles and modes of  \norganization in these works offer early examples \nof  some characteristics that define Gubaidulina\u2019s \nlater output.\nThe first and last works to be included on \nthe disc utilize Bach as a reference point. The \nChaconne (1963) draws on the Baroque form as \na vehicle to bring together a range of  styles and \ndramatic gestures. This polystylism should not be \nread into too deeply in the light of  the compos-\ner\u2019s subsequent output: rather, it gives access to \ndiverse characters that help shape the discourse. \nAllusions to Bach, such as in the rich organ-like \ntexture of  the Chaconne theme, also carry with \nthem a sense of  spirituality that is so important \nto Gubaidulina\u2019s music. The final work, the \nInvention of  1974, is a homage to Bach\u2019s two-part \ninventions.\nThe Sonata (1965) extends the range of  sonori-\nties available, not only through clever pedal effects \nbut also through playing inside the body of  the \ninstrument. Once again, distinct textures, sonori-\nties and modes of  organization are juxtaposed \nto create a compelling structure that, despite its \napparent freedom, nevertheless engages the lis-\ntener and carries the music forward.\nThe series of  character pieces in Musical Toys \n(1969) are by turn humorous, evocative and \ndelightful; similar to Schumann\u2019s Kinderscenen, this \nis music for children that adults can appreciate. As \nwith the Piano Sonata, the use of  the pedal and \nholding down keys widens the palette of  sounds \nand offers a greater range of  expressive effects. \nSimilar instances can be found in the small-scale \nToccata-Troncata (yet another Bachian allusion?).\nIn these live performances, the pianist Marcela \nRoggeri demonstrates an engaging deftness of  \ntouch that allows these works to speak clearly \nwith wit, charm and passion.\nThe other disc includes three works for piano \nby the Catalan composer and pianist Josep Cerc\u00f3s \nFransi (1925\u20131989). According to the CD notes, \nCerc\u00f3s\u2019s compositional output moved through \nfour distinct stages: initially \u2018post-romantic\u2019, \nhe turned to a neo-classical idiom, then work \n\u2018characterized by constant investigation and \ninnovation\u2019 that was stimulated by his encounter \nwith the European avant-garde, and finally a late \nperiod that synthesizes the earlier three. Although \nthe works on offer belong chronologically to \neach of  the final three periods, they each demon-\nstrate certain idiosyncrasies that suggest the disc \nmight not be wholly representative of  Cerc\u00f3s\u2019s \nachievements.\nThe first piece, a Hindemith-inspired Sonata \nen si m (1952), belongs to Cerc\u00f3s\u2019s neo-classi-\ncal phase. An earnest sonata-Allegro establishes \nmany of  the main characteristics to be found in \nall four movements: a straight-forward formal \nscheme, harmonic clarity, some interesting rhyth-\nmic quirks, a tendency for contrapuntal writing \nand lighter textures, and a generally understated \ncharacter that avoids grand climaxes. This seem-\ning refusal to commit to bold gestures lessens the \neffect of  the motoric rhythms of  the Scherzo and \nTrio and inhibits the lengthier slow movement. \nA lighter finale closes the sonata. The work as a \nwhole ultimately failed to please Cerc\u00f3s, who \ntried to destroy all copies; a 1954 publication of  it \nprevented it from being lost.\nComposed during Cerc\u00f3s\u2019s more experimen-\ntal phase, La utilitat de les flors (1967) nevertheless \nadopts a straightforward traditional approach \nthat befits its function (a children\u2019s ballet); the disc \ntherefore contains no example of  the composer\u2019s \navant-garde work. The seven movements are all \nshort character pieces, often gently witty, and the \nset frequently alludes to other composers and a \nrange of  genres. As with the sonata, dramatic and \nclimactic moments are suppressed or avoided in \nfavour of  elegance.\nThe final work, Escenes d\u2019un Circ (1980) is \nanother short ballet for piano, again with seven \nmovements, and again preferring a story that \navoids the need for the flamboyance or high emo-\ntion. Once again, character pieces are the order of  \nthe day, and traces of  the composer\u2019s late period, \nor synthesis of  different styles, are absent. Perhaps \nit is the case that Cerc\u00f3s\u2019s output as a whole is \nmarked by a quiet, unassuming voice that prefers \npastiche, charm and subtlety to grander gestures. \nIf  so, this disc provides a suitable, if  unremarkable, \nintroduction. Nevertheless, a disc that includes \ntwo pieces that have little connexion to the com-\nposer\u2019s main concerns at the time (the ballets) and \none that he wished to destroy, offers first-time \nlisteners a curious means of  approaching this \nunfamiliar body of  work.\nEdward Venn\ncorigliano: Circus Maximus (Symphony No. 3 for \nlarge wind ensemble); Gazebo Dances.

John \nCorigliano has suited the music to fit the action, \nin his most explosive and visceral manner. It isn\u2019t \njust roaring lions, careering chariots and scream-\ning humans however. It\u2019s much worse than that. \nAll repulsive human folly is here \u2026 cruelty, vul-\ngarity, and obscenity. Does the composer wallow \nin it? No, he translates it into a contemporary \ncontext where voyeurism has returned and mass \nentertainment now takes the form of  reality TV, \ncelebrity culture and the internet. The only miss-\ning ingredient from this modern-day paradigm \nis death. The sound quality is magnificent and \nthe CD concludes with the early Gazebo Dances \n(1972). Corigliano has just opened a spectacular \nnew website: www.johncorigliano.com.\nThe Mississippian Samuel Jones (b. 1935) turns \nto the grandeur of  the southwestern USA in his \nSymphony No. 3, Palo Duro Canyon, named for \na notable landmark not far from the town of  \nAmarillo. A quiet start quickly yields to animated \nbrass fanfares which put me in mind of  Menotti\u2019s \nApocalypse and the final movement of  Rautavaara\u2019s \nEighth Symphony (written some years later!). \nThere are other similarities to Rautavaara in the \nharmonic structure and multi-layered lyricism. \nBut that Jones is a skilled and original craftsman is \nalso evident from the Tuba Concerto (2005). This \nis his second Naxos recording, but with a number \nof  other Seattle Symphony commissions to his \ncredit in recent years I hope it won\u2019t be his last. \nVittorio Giannini\u2019s music belongs to a much ear-\nlier aesthetic. The massive Piano Concerto (1937) \nhasn\u2019t been heard for 70 years. It may have struck \nsome familiar chords at its premi\u00e8re but today \nit exudes a warm Romantic afterglow. It may be \nderivative at times, but its confident stride carries \nall before it. The soloist copes magnificently with \nthe technical demands, full-on for 20 minutes at a \ntime. It is good that works like this are still being \ndiscovered and recorded. The consummate mas-\ntery of  the Symphony No. 4 (1960) shows Giannini \nat the height of  his powers.\nGunther Schuller, now in his 80s, has slid into an \nelder statesman role with such ease that it is quite \nhard to imagine him in the late 1950s as a radical \nfigure seeking to fuse classical and jazz idioms. \nThe three works from this period stem from his \ndrive to complete what he regarded as unfinished \nbusiness from the 1920s when, briefly, Gershwin, \nCopland and others saw the potential for the two \nstreams to be moulded. Certainly interesting, \nbut the middle work, with narrator, is rather less \nso. Michael Daugherty\u2019s whimsical Sunset Strip \nevokes memories of  1950s Los Angeles and the \nbeat generation. Daugherty has a strong affinity \nfor retro-pop culture and has written a number \nof  pieces on similar themes such as Hell\u2019s Angels \nand Route 66. His music is direct and appealingly \nextrovert. John Williams is more introspective \nand fantasy-oriented, perhaps a consequence of  \nyears of  writing music for Steven Spielberg mov-\nies! Escapades, from another recent film score, has \nbeen fashioned into a mini alto saxophone con-\ncerto (in 2009 Williams has also had a new Harp \nConcerto and Viola Concerto premi\u00e8red). Lions \n(1963) by Ned Rorem (receiving its first recording \nin 40 years) is one of  his most exquisite orches-\ntral fantasies, a dream-sequence of  an encounter \nwith a family of  lions in a house as an imaginary \njazz quartet plays. There is a Rabelaisian irrever-\nence and jocosity about Christopher Rouse\u2019s \nmusic, and the French connexion is in evidence in \nFriandises (or \u2018morsels\u2019), a neo-baroque suite with \noccasional rude and brash interruptions from a \nmore contemporary age.\n2009 is the bicentenary of  Lincoln\u2019s birth and \nNaxos have put together a 2-CD set of  the famil-\niar (Copland\u2019s Lincoln Portrait) and the unfamiliar. \nVincent Persichetti\u2019s A Lincoln Address evoked a \nstorm at the time of  Richard Nixon\u2019s second inau-\nguration (the Inauguration Committee asked for \nthe score to be excised of  a number of  Civil War \nreferences). The ensuing publicity ensured it did \nget played but it has languished for over three dec-\nades. Ernst Bacon (1898\u20131990) has languished too, \nwhich is a pity since he wrote many interesting \nand well-crafted works, including several sym-\nphonies and other pieces which must be worthy \nof  exploration. Ford\u2019s Theatre (1946), a series of  \nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ntempo88\nelegiac and thoughtful sketches, was recorded in \nthe early days of  LP and was quite widely heard \nin the USA 60 or so years ago, often with Bacon as \nconductor. It reflects the composer\u2019s dignified and \nunsentimental admiration and reverence for the \n16th President. Morton Gould was a young man \nwho in the patriotic fervour of  1940s America rec-\nognized an opportunity to celebrate in music a \nnational icon. Lincoln Legend, although premi\u00e8red \nby Toscanini, faded too, and probably has not \nbeen heard again until now. The Gould formula \nof  vernacular and sacred song shaken up into a \ncocktail of  jazz and razzmatazz is effected with \nthe usual dash and energy. The Turok and McKay \npieces are pleasant interludes but with less to offer \nthan Ives and Harris.

It\u2019s good to \nhave a recording of  one of  his ten symphonies con-\nducted by the composer, as well as first recordings \nof  two further works in Adriano\u2019s orchestral cycle \nfor Guild. The Moscow Symphony Orchestra\u2019s \nperformance of  the Fifth Symphony under his \nbaton is highly impressive. Distinct echoes of  \nBeethoven and Brahms, often present in the earlier \nsymphonies, are again in evidence: Brun himself  \nmentioned a preparatory study of  Beethoven to \nHermann Scherchen. Apart from a double bas-\nsoon and bass tuba, the orchestra doesn\u2019t exceed \nclassical dimensions. The first movement takes \nthe form of  a chaconne, one of  whose variations \nprovides the subject of  a skittish second-move-\nment nocturne. This is succeeded by a funeral \nmarch, an eloquent lament for Brun\u2019s deceased \ncolleague Hermann Suter. In his final movement, \nthe composer vents his spleen over Suter\u2019s fate. \nHeaded Rasch und w\u00fctend (\u2018fast and furious\u2019), the \nfinale begins fugally and weaves further variations \non the work\u2019s initial theme.\nA long time ago Brun\u2019s opening chaconne \n\u2013 it could easily be taken for a closing movement \n\u2013 appeared on a recording under Schoenberg\u2019s \nSwiss pupil Erich Schmid. Brun regarded his Fifth \nas a personal response to the break-up of  clas-\nsical tonality, one that was orientated towards \nStravinsky rather than Schoenberg. Deep down, \nhowever, the neo-Romantic language is unmis-\ntakably his own, and the chaconne seems more \noriginal every time I hear it. The solo oboe, horn, \nviolin and cello execute their solo variations \nwith finesse. \nFritz Brun\u2019s sunnier side emerges from the \nTenth Symphony, which was completed by the \nshores of  Lake Lugano in 1953 (the date is inad-\nvertently transposed on the back of  the CD case). \nLike the Second Symphony of  1909, but in a more \ncompressed form, it recalls the exuberance of  \nSchumann\u2019s \u2018Spring\u2019 Symphony in the same key. \nRhapsodic in spirit, the third-movement Adagio \nshows Brun\u2019s variation technique at its most \nimaginative. Again the performance as a whole \nunderlines his creative stature, long obscured by \nhis native reputation as a conductor in Berne.\nHe appears as conductor of  his own music on \na remastering of  a rather cavernous 1946 radio \nrecording preserved in the Zurich Central Library. \nThe Eighth Symphony is one of  Brun\u2019s most \nexpansive works, recalling his abiding fondness \nfor Bruckner in that respect. While carrying a \nprogramme describing the times of  day, the sym-\nphony adheres to a traditional movement-order, \nstarting with the activity of  high noon and ending \nwith a new day. The enchanted second movement \nderives from a Bernese folk song addressed to \nHesperus, the evening star. Then Brun conjures \na nocturnal landscape, less agitated than his Fifth \nSymphony\u2019s Berliozian visions. Throughout the \nwork, the rhythmic and harmonic invention is \nconsiderable.\nThe Eighth Symphony has been coupled by \nGuild with Paul Sacher\u2019s 1946 recording of  anoth-\ner fine late work, Variations on an Original Theme. \nWhereas the Tenth Symphony features concerto \ngrosso-like writing for wind instruments, here a \nsimilar technique is applied to the strings. Lyrical \nnostalgia is the dominant impression, but the \nsolo piano (Brun\u2019s own instrument) maintains a \nvital pulse.\nLike Mahler and other full-time conductors, \nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ncd reviews 89\nFritz Brun had to be a Sommerkomponist for much \nof  his life. His output did, however, grow stead-\nily, unlike that of  his contemporary Wilhelm \nFurtw\u00e4ngler. The latter\u2019s First Violin Sonata, WF \n113, occupied Furtw\u00e4ngler on and off  for rough-\nly 20 years, eventually receiving its premi\u00e8re in \n1937. There is a recording from the 1990s made by \nDong-Suk Kang with Fran\u00e7ois Kerdoncuff. More \nrecently the Swiss-born violinist Bettina Boller has \nbeen playing the piece in recitals. The verve she \nbrought to recordings of  concertos by Othmar \nSchoeck, Hermann Suter and Wladimir Vogel \nmade her new double CD an appealing prospect. \nNor does Boller disappoint with her \nFurtw\u00e4ngler recording. When the great man \nwrites Immer steigern, aber dasselbe Tempo bleiben \n(\u2018Keep intensifying, but in the same tempo\u2019), the \nviolinist and her keyboard partner Walter Prossnitz \nknow exactly what he meant. Furtw\u00e4ngler\u2019s writ-\ning has two things in common with Fritz Brun\u2019s: \na near-Brucknerian constructional span and a \nvirtually self-contained first movement. Deftly \nobservant of  dynamic and harmonic shifts, the \nduo expound the Sonata\u2019s emotional argument \nwith conviction.\nWhen he learnt that Hindemith\u2019s compositions \nhad been vetoed by the Third Reich, Furtw\u00e4ngler \nobjected that the officially acceptable Reger was \nless harmless than he seemed. Boller brings the \nrequired passion and subtlety to Reger\u2019s capacious \nSonata in C minor, op. 139, and she makes each \nnote count in Hindemith\u2019s two-movement Sonata \nin E of  1935. The Swiss composer Hans Schaeuble \nis not out of  place in such company. His Second \nViolin Sonata (1946) reflects that stylistic eclecti-\ncism discussed by Annalise Plummer in Tempo \nNo. 218 \u2013 and also his mastery of  extended finales. \nWith Prossnitz, Bettina Boller reveals the inherent \nwarmth of  this music.\n Peter Palmer\nlees: Toccata; Six Ornamental Etudes; Three Preludes; \nSonata Breve; Odyssey.

His \nThird Piano Concerto was premi\u00e8red in Florida \nin 2007 and recently he has completed his Third \nPiano Trio (due for premi\u00e8re at Dartington this \nsummer), an organ work (his first for the instru-\nment) and a new piano piece for Barbara Nissman. \nAs of  April 2009 he is about to start a new orches-\ntral work. This new CD of  his piano music covers \nalmost the entire span of  his career so far from \n1947 to 2005. There can be few examples in the \nwhole of  music literature of  sustained assuredness \nand consistency of  stylistic quality. The very early \nToccata, written when he was only 23, possesses \na rugged muscularity also found in the music of  \nLees\u2019s mentor George Antheil, even though they \nhad not yet met. \nIn fact Lees has been strongly influenced by \nAntheil\u2019s ethos of  propulsive meters and edgy \nostinati: indeed he describes himself  as a \u2018vis-\nceral\u2019 composer. Yet the strength of  character of  \nall of  Lees\u2019s music is moulded and informed by \nseveral aesthetic influences. In 1954 he settled in \nFrance for several years and became fascinated \nwith surrealist art; its vivid and sometimes per-\nverse imagery became a strong influence in his \nkeyboard music. It can be strongly detected in \nthe brief  but greatly contrasting Six Ornamental \nEtudes of  1957, in which imagery alternates \nbetween the graphic and the reflective, but the \nlandscapes are abstracts of  mood and demean-\nour rather than visual portraits. The Sonata Breve \nfrom the same period also exhibits a range of  con-\ntrasts, but this time within a tight one-movement \nsonata structure, cast almost as a tone poem. The \nmusic carries a powerful narrative force, as does \nall Lees\u2019s music: it knows exactly where it is going \nand the listener is swept along by an exalted rheto-\nric of  utterance. Lees represents an artistic ethic \nthat draws deeply on the noblest aspirations of  \nthe human spirit: his lifelong quest for inner truth \nand integrity has never wavered and his canon of  \nwork will always remain a shining monument to \nhumanity\u2019s dogged determination to affirm life \nand all the best that it brings.\nThe Three Preludes of  1962, written for the \npianist Joseph Bloch, display Ravelian brilliance, \nrecalling that of  Gaspard de la Nuit. Lees describes \nhow the three works entitled Odyssey came to be \nwritten over a period of  35 years. No. 1 was com-\nposed for John Ogdon, and is an exploration of  \ntextures and techniques. Again the mention of  \n\u2018surrealist landscape\u2019 reminds us of  Lees\u2019s aes-\nthetic, and evokes the notion of  a journey. The \nsecond (1986) is a successor but a more complex \none, and the third (2005), written for the present \nartist Mirian Conti, is, according to the composer, \neven more \u2018disturbing\u2019 than the other two. Mirian \nConti adds her own illuminating comments to \nthose of  the composer and expresses her high \nregard for the three Odyssey works. It is especial-\nly gratifying when a composer finds a champion \nperformer and the artistic synthesis which ensues. \nThis latest release of  Lees\u2019s music will do him \nnothing but good: the quality of  his workmanship \nand the compelling authority of  his technique pro-\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ntempo90\nvide further evidence of  a lifetime spent enriching \nthe literature of  serious American music.

Arne Deforce (vlc) with \n1Yutaka Oya (pno). Aeon AECD 0977 (2CD-set).\nArne Deforce\u2019s booklet notes for this release com-\nprise a collection of  text fragments from Feldman\u2019s \nGive My Regards to Eighth Street and Morton Feldman \nsays. The snippets give windows into Feldman\u2019s \ncreative processes, perhaps the most telling of  \nwhich is \u2018my desire was not to \u201ccompose\u201d, but to \nproject sounds into time, free from a composition-\nal rhetoric that had no place here\u2019. The quotations \nare also intensely relevant to the works presented \nand shed much light on Feldman\u2019s aesthetic.\nFeldman\u2019s expansive pieces invoke a kind of  \nmeditative stasis in their use of  ostinati and their \npredilection towards silence. Recently, I reviewed \nFor Christian Wolff (Bridge 9279) for these pages, \na piece that lasts just under three hours. Written \nfive years earlier, Patterns in a chromatic field for \ncello and piano exhibits the characteristics of  late \nFeldman perfectly. There are explosions of  sound, \nunpredictable in their placings. Functionality is \neffectively neutralized, in that gestures which \nmay present themselves as important simply may \nnever be heard again. The musical surface invites \nspeculation on the part of  the listener \u2013 despite \nthe mesmeric qualities of  the general quiet and \nstasis, part of  the listening experience is undeni-\nably active in nature. \nFeldman was concerned with freedom, in \nemancipating the various parameters, but at the \nsame time he was obsessed with permutation. \n\u2018Do it one way and do it another. Spell it one way, \nthen spell it another way\u2019, as he himself  put it. At \nthe heart of  the process of  emancipation is that \nof  freeing time (\u2018I am interested in how the wild \nbeast lives in the jungle \u2013 not in the zoo\u2019, said \nFeldman). His most telling comment is possibly, \n\u2018For me sound was the hero, and still is. I feel that I \nam subservient\u2019. The sounds give him life. There \nare so many contradictions here. The music can \nbe heart-stoppingly delicate, and yet still project \nits own eternal indestructability. The use of  more \nemotional sections, such as the pleading upward \ncello glissandi of  the second track of  disc 2, are \nall the more pronounced for their rarity. Arne \nDeforce\u2019s control of  his instrument is masterly \n(listen to the extended repetitions of  whispered \nharmonics, each perfectly rendered, on Disc 1); \nYukata Oya is almost as sensitive.\nThe remaining four pieces are dwarfed by \nPatterns in a chromatic field.

Feldman\u2019s \nfive pieces called Projections are graphic works, \nwhile Duration II specifies pitch but not other para-\nmeters \u2013 the instrumentalists begin together but \ncontinue in their own ways. Composition \u2013 eight \nlittle pieces (1950) is Webernian in utterance, but \nthe material is perhaps even more aphoristic, \nand certainly more insubstantial. The predomi-\nnantly quiet dynamic emphasizes the fragility of  \nthe exercise, while Intersection IV concentrates \non the creation of  wide registral spaces.

The action of  Shakespeare has \nbeen converted into a libretto by Mark Shulgasser, \nand was substantially revised in 1996, with near-\nly half  an hour cut from the original three-hour \nscore. Turning Shakespeare inside out, re-ordering \nand abridging the text can be a high-risk strategy, \nespecially where the plot is diffuse and, as with \nThe Tempest, somewhat contrived to say the least. \nIt can also dangerously alter the characterization \nof  the main roles. It seems to work here, however, \nalthough there are some instances where already \nobscure verse is rendered even more obscure \nby altering its context \u2013 for example in one of  \nProspero\u2019s early speeches in Act 1 (CD1 Track 2) \nwhere I momentarily lost the sense altogether. \nOne cannot but accept however that the text had \nto be modified for operatic purposes, so as to pre-\nvent the opera sprawling out to four hours. \nMoreover, some roles are very demanding \nindeed, especially that of  Ariel, often pitted for \nlong periods against a surging orchestral palette. \nThe music is exceptionally lyrical and tuneful and \nat times very exotic \u2013 especially where Ariel and \nthe sprites are concerned: tuned percussion, harp, \nceleste, piano and glockenspiel and long lyrical \nvocalises conjure up thoughts of  Szymanowski \n(King Roger) or even Bernard Herrmann (Wuthering \nHeights). The drama certainly works on CD and \nthe music pulls you in to this very attractive work, \nwhich appears to have been the subject of  a lavish \nproduction by the Purchase Opera of  New York. \nThe love duet between Ferdinand and Miranda in \nAct 3 contains some of  the loveliest music. Hoiby \nhas that rare ability to sustain a line both vocally \nand orchestrally over long periods. \nThis is present-day grand opera using the full \nresources of  musical theatre. The moderately large \norchestra takes a leading role and at times achieves \nalmost Straussian power. Maybe sharper musical \ndefinition of  some characters would have made \nfor an even more effective drama, for instance \nthose of  Prospero and Alonso, and Stefano and \nAntonio (although those two are a bit shadowy in \nthe play). Ariel is invariably magnificent, and the \nending is a brilliantly effective drawing together \nall the characters in a massive musical pageant. \nThis is an enjoyable studio recording which comes \noff  well with good soloists and very presentable \norchestra. The music is glorious and ranks with \nthe best I have ever heard by Hoiby, who on the \nstrength of  this achievement deserves to be much \nbetter known. \nHoiby\u2019s songs are, according to the sleeve notes, \nthe medium for which he is best known. Whilst \nstudying in Rome in the early 1950s, he was criti-\ncized for writing in a dated style. \u2018I wanted to grow \nheirloom roses but they allowed you only cactus-\nes!\u2019 The influence of  Barber, but also of  Schubert \n(a lifelong hero) is striking. The songs span over \n50 years, Hoiby\u2019s entire life as a composer. The \ntexts are mainly taken from 19th- and 20th-cen-\ntury English and American poetry (Blake, Hardy, \nWhitman, Emma Lazarus). Not previously know-\ning many Hoiby songs I was unprepared for the \ntreasure which awaited me. His setting of  Blake\u2019s \n\u2018The Lamb\u2019 is timeless. So too is \u2018Lied de Liebe\u2019 \nand \u2018Nuits\u2019. He proves an excellent accompanist, \ntoo, on this disc, including one number (\u2018Evening\u2019, \nby Wallace Stevens) which Leontyne Price regu-\nlarly sang with him. His songs are models of  taste \nand character. \nIf  you need any evidence of  Lee Hoiby\u2019s status \nas a Renaissance man, go no further than these \ntwo releases, and start with the songs.\nStephen Paulus celebrated his 60th birthday in \nAugust 2009. He is in huge demand as a composer, \nreceiving many commissions from a wide range \nof  organizations in the USA and elsewhere, espe-\ncially churches and choirs, vocalists, orchestras \nand music schools. He remains under-represent-\ned on CD, however. With well over 350 works to \nhis credit, the last few years alone have seen the \ncompletion of  a very lyrical and vibrant Concerto \nfor Two Trumpets and Orchestra (2003), a fine \norchestral song cycle for Deborah Voigt, Erotic \nSpirits (2005), a Concerto for Piano and Winds \n(2006) and a large cantata A Procession of  Seasons \n(2007). August 2009 saw the unveiling of  a new \nCello Concerto for Lynn Harrell and the Grand \nTeton Music Festival, and an orchestral cycle of  \npoems by Dylan Thomas will be premi\u00e8red in \nTucson in late October 2009. \nHowever Paulus\u2019s most important recent work \nis To Be Certain of  the Dawn (2005), an hour-long \ncantata commissioned as a gift to a synagogue in \nMinneapolis to commemorate the 60th anniver-\nsary of  the liberation of  the Nazi death camps \nin 1945. Since its premi\u00e8re in Minneapolis four \nyears ago the work has been widely performed \nin America and Europe and its very approach-\nable idiom, sympathetic texts (by Michael Dennis \nBrowne) and the inclusion of  a major choral role \nfor children have generated strong popular appeal. \nThe work is focused on the million-and-a-half  chil-\ndren who perished, and Browne says the children \nrepresent \u2018the sun, moon and stars\u2019. The work\u2019s \nethos takes it beyond the terror and cruelty of  the \nHolocaust by appealing to the spirit of  human-\nity, of  reconciliation, love and healing. Indeed, \nthe final words sung (in Hebrew) are: \u2018Love your \nneighbour as yourself \u2019. The opening section, \n\u2018Renewal\u2019, contains some of  the most animated \nmusic (a shofar, or ram\u2019s horn, is heard at various \nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ntempo92\npoints), prefaced by the Cantor\u2019s intonation: \u2018Hear, \nO Israel\u2019. But far from being an overtly dramatic \nwork (in the manner of, for example, Benjamin \nLees\u2019s Symphony No. 4 Memorial Candles, a major \nHolocaust symphony from the 1980s), the power \nof  this music derives from its inner struggle to find \npeace and, if  not closure, then at least a modus viv-\nendi. The passage of  time may not heal completely \nbut it can bring pause for quieter reflection and \nthere are many passages of  tenderness and poign-\nancy. I was particularly moved by the opening of  \nthe second of  the work\u2019s three parts: \u2018We are just \ntwo little girls in the street, sisters? What do you \nthink? Do you like the pretty red coat \u2026?\u2019 \nThe composer achieves a balance of  narra-\ntive by alternating children\u2019s choir (sometimes \nin Hebrew) with the main chorus and soloists. \nThe texts, by focusing on individuals or small \ngroups rather than on huge numbers, remind us \nof  the incomprehensible enormity of  the sum \ntotal of  each personal story. The middle section, \n\u2018Remembrance\u2019, has the children\u2019s choir singing a \nnumber of  Hebrew blessings, and a Hymn to the \nEternal Flame: \u2018Every face is in you, every voice, \nevery sorrow, every pity \u2026\u2019.The piece ends with \na final section, \u2018Visions\u2019, in which memories com-\nbine with hope for the future. There is, too, the \nguilt of  the survivor: \u2018Why did I survive?\u2019 \u2018God \nkept you on earth to write the story\u2019.\nThis is an important landmark in the long pro-\ncession of  artistic responses to what was probably \nthe greatest crime in human history.

During her studies \nin the 1960s she instinctively reacted away from \ndodecaphony and serialism (although John Cage \nwas, and remains, a seminal influence), following \nrather the path of  an ethnomusicologist, from \nwhich her own compositional voice began to \nemerge in the 1970s. Her output is modest in size, \nincluding unaccompanied instrumental works, \nchamber music, pieces for gamelan-style ensem-\nbles and theatre pieces such as her shadow-puppet \nopera Karna (1994). The range of  her expressive \nm\u00e9lange is illustrated on the one hand by Wayang \nEsther (2001, subtitled \u2018A Javanese Purimspiel\u2019), an \noperatic retelling of  the Biblical story of  Esther \nfor Indonesian shadows puppets with gamelan \naccompaniment, and, on the other, Tamil Quartets \n(2007) mixing string quartet with tabla and other \nIndian drums.\nThe two Barang pieces included on New \nWorld\u2019s release are amongst her earliest extant \npieces, part of  a set of  four from 1975 in which one \nor two melody instruments weave euphonious \nlines strongly influenced by Indonesian music. \n(Benary studied Indian and Indonesian music \nbut it is Javanese music that had the most long-\nlasting impact on her own works.) She seems to \nhave had the flute in mind when writing Barang I, \nbut both pieces work very nicely on the clarinet. \nIndeed, listening to the two of  them together \nthey form a beguiling diptych, the single line of  \nthe first amplified by the interwoven textures of  \nthe second. Interweaving lines are a fundamental \naspect of  Benary\u2019s work, as her series of  Braid \npieces from the late 1970s and 1980s demonstrate. \nThese generally follow a gently euphonious \nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ncd reviews 93\ncourse, not unlike traditional Javanese music (and \nunlike the harder tones of  the modern Balinese \n\u2018gong kebyar\u2019 style). \nA more volatile element entered Benary\u2019s \nmusic in the 1990s, as exemplified by two other \nworks here. Downtown Steel (1993) is a vibrant \noctet for clarinet, saxophone, trombone, tuba \nand four percussionists which uses gamelan-\nstyle sonorities and textures in a purely Western \ncontext. The two untitled movements alternate \nmusic of  toccata-like vigour with moments of  \nreflection \u2013 for example in the quiet coda \u2013 that \nsucceeds in reconciling if  not fusing its disparate \nraw elements. In the largest (and most recent) \nwork presented, Aural Shoehorning (1997 \u2013 the title \nderives from a critic\u2019s comment: now there\u2019s a \nfirst), Benary juxtaposes western and Indonesian \ninstruments, with their different tunings, within a \nsingle design, with marvellous results, especially \nat those points of  genuine crossover, as in the \ncoda to the opening \u2018Plainsong\u2019, where the main \ntheme moves from gamelan to piano. The effect \nis like looking at an object in the flesh and then at \nits reflection in a lake: the object is fundamentally \nthe same, but the reflection both loses something \nfrom the original and supplies a fresh perspective. \nAs the work proceeds, the two ensembles overlap, \nintermingle and fuse with by turns menacing, \neerie and exhilarating effect.\nThe title work of  New World\u2019s disc is Sun on \nSnow (1985), a vocal-plus-instrumental septet \n(which can be performed by one or two sopranos \nwith 5\u20138 accompanists) in five movements that \nplay continuously. The piece sets an anagrammatic \nnature poem consisting of  25 words arranged \nin five lines of  five words apiece. Quieter, more \nspiritual than the two other ensemble pieces, it lies \nstylistically mid-way between the contemplative \nBarangs and the vivacious Downtown Steel. The \nuse of  an electric guitar strikes a curiously surreal \nnote, sounding fleetingly like an escapee from \nMike Oldfield\u2019s Tubular Bells, but it exemplifies \nanother occasional trend in Benary\u2019s eclectic \nmake-up: a kind of  underground assimilation \nof  jazz. Big band textures in particular make \ncameo appearances in both Aural Shoehorning \nand Downtown Steel. The works are performed by \nmembers of  New York\u2019s DownTown Ensemble \nand the Gamelan Son of  Lion, which was co-\nfounded by Benary in 1976 (the Gamelan\u2019s name is \na translation of  her Hebrew surname; it is notable \nhow little overt Jewishness is evident in the works \npresented here). Benary herself  appears in the \ngamelan in Aural Shoehorning, as the violinist in \nSun on Snow and as a percussionist in Downtown \nSteel. New World\u2019s sound is first-rate as is the disc \nall in all.\nEve Beglarian (b. 1958) is the daughter of  the \ndistinguished American academic and composer \nGrant Beglarian. Where Benary\u2019s music is \npredominantly gentle, veering towards vigorous, \nBeglarian\u2019s is brash, volatile and exuberantly \nin-your-face. It has its moments of  quietude \nand repose, as at the outset of  Creating the World \n(1996), a surreal, quarter-hour multi-genre setting \nfor speaker, soprano and sextet (including electric \nguitar and mallet percussion) of  Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz\u2019s \nirreverent poem. Beglarian\u2019s freewheeling setting \nof  the poem (here featuring British actor Roger \nRees in splendid voice) creates an atmosphere close \nto the spirit of  The Hitch-hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy \nand ends with a rollicking dance owing much to \nmodern jazz and rock, although the work\u2019s ethos \nis fundamentally Classical. The Marriage of  Heaven \nand Hell (1994) is of  similar dimensions and (as \nthe title suggests) built around words by William \nBlake. Here, though, the text is less central to the \nwhole, assembled from fragments stitched into \nthe instrumental fabric and declaimed or sung \n(here by soprano-composer Lisa Bielawa). The \ninfluence of  minimalism is felt most heavily in \nthis piece, the wind-based sound-world not unlike \nMichael Nyman but with a distinctly New York \naccent. \nBy contrast, the brief  Robin Redbreast (2003) \nis a quiet, sombre song for voice, piccolo and \nelectronics to a sad poem by Stanley Kunitz \nconcerning the death of  a robin. Like the \ninstrumental Wonder Counselor (1996) for organ \nand tape (the organist is not credited) Robin \nRedbreast is basically a single-mood piece which \nweaves along its doleful path in under five \nminutes. Wonder Counselor is more developmental, \nthough Beglarian\u2019s sense of  humour is apparent \nin the accompaniment which includes the \nsound of  an erotic encounter. In Landscaping for \nPrivacy (1995), the composer is heard declaiming \nLinda Norton\u2019s poem (not reproduced in the \nbooklet), emphasizing the text\u2019s nice irony, over \nan undulating piano accompaniment originally \ndesigned to be performed on tape but later recast \nfor a live performer. Since the pianist is not credited \nhere, I assume the tape original is reproduced.\nNew World\u2019s finale is another instrumental, \nFlamingO (1995, rev. 2004), for a small orchestra of  \nwind quintet plus cor anglais, trumpet, trombone, \npiano, percussion, string trio and double bass, but \nwith a prominent solo for vibraphone and taped \nsamples (including the cries of  the eponymous \nwading bird). This is another raucous invention \nfull of  teeming lines, vivid textures and a \nmelange of  different styles and moods. It is given \na thunderously committed performance by its \n15 executants and brings the disc to a rousing \nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ntempo94\nconclusion, though the work ends with a fade-out. \nNew World\u2019s sound is once again very fine.\nSilvina Milstein (b. 1956) is Argentinian by \nbirth but has been a UK resident since the military \ncoup in her homeland in 1976. A former pupil \nof  Weir and Cresswell in Glasgow and Goehr in \nCambridge, she is currently Senior Lecturer at \nKing\u2019s College, London. Unlike both Benary and \nBeglarian, who reacted away from the atonality \nand serialism of  their student days and academe \ninto more audience-friendly styles, Milstein has \nremained within the modernist camp. The six \nworks on Lontano\u2019s new disc provide a good \noverview of  her music between 1997 (of  lavender \nlight \u2026) and 2005 (cristales y susurrus), exhibiting \nher flair for lyrical writing, her command of  \ninstrumental line and ability to create often \nsuccinct, satisfying musical structures. The \nsingle unbroken lines of  the solo violin works, \nthe unending rose (1999), show these traits at their \nmost pared down, shorn of  all inessentials, yet still \npoetic in expression if  a touch austere in texture. \nThe title derives from a poem by Jorge Luis \nBorges about a Sufi poet\u2019s musings to the rose of  \nthe title, its spirit reflected in the epigraph of  the \nFirst, \u2018And told her in words that had no sound\u2019. \nNo. 2 took its inspiration from the final act of  \nShakespeare\u2019s Anthony and Cleopatra, specifically \nfrom Cleopatra\u2019s death and her dying gesture of  \ndefiance \u2018I am fire and air \u2026\u2019 and is perhaps more \ntheatrical in expressive profile.\nCuriously, the one Milstein work here to \nfeature the human voice, in a setting of  a richly \nerotic poem by San Juan de la Cruz which one can \nimagine Eve Beglarian relishing to the full, I found \nthe most opaque expressively. Fire dressed in black \n(2002) was originally written for mezzo-soprano, \ncello and piano but is given here in its expanded \nrevision with clarinet. Despite the extra richness \nof  texture provided by the wind player, fire dressed \nin black remains stubbornly aloof  emotionally, its \nmusic not touching the subtleties of  the verse, \nwhich describes a lover\u2019s clandestine creeping \nthrough a darkened house at night to meet his \nbeloved. The problem, I suspect, is the musical \nlanguage: Milstein\u2019s atonal harmonies cannot \nexpress the thrilling sensations of  expectancy and \nlust of  de la Cruz\u2019s ardent lover, nor the essential \nlightness of  the text.\nMilstein is stronger with more abstract designs \nand less direct inspiration, as with cristales y \nsusurrus (\u2018Whispering crystals\u2019, 2005), given here \nin its original version for a septet of  flute doubling \npiccolo, clarinet doubling bass clarinet, harp, string \ntrio and double bass (an alternative version for \npiano quintet exists). Here a tapestry of  \u2018evocative \ngestures drawn for the vernacular of  Buenos \nAires proliferate echoing the ripples left by the \npleasures and intimacy of  a magical night\u2019. The \nphysicality and ardour so lacking in fire dressed in \nblack is here in full measure, and a musical portrait \nemerges of  the Argentine capital rather different \nto the one provided by Piazzola. The flow of  ideas \nand their developments is in marked contrast to \nof  lavender light, for 11 players, in which Milstein \ncomposed \u2018lightly tinted silences\u2019 mimicking the \nbald spots in some Cezanne artworks (although \nthe title refers to Van Gogh). Milstein controls the \ncontrasts in tone and texture admirably but on the \nwhole of  lavender light is less effective than cristales \ny susurrus and both fall sort of  tigres azules (\u2018Blue \ntigers\u201d, 2003), which is by some way the most \nvivid and vibrant work on offer. It is written for a \nsmall orchestra of  15, for the London Sinfonietta, \ndivided into two groups in the manner of  a \nconcerto grosso: a continuo of  harpsichord, \npiano, harp, celesta and percussion and a concerto \nof  wind and string quintets. The blue tigers of  \nthe title again derive from Borges and India but \none needs no special knowledge to appreciate \nits ineluctable rhythmic and expressive flow. \nLontano\u2019s performances are superb (as always) as \nis the sound and John Taylor\u2019s production.\nJudith Bailey (1941) is a local composerly \nphenomenon similar to Benary and Beglarian, \nthough rooted in her native Cornwall (for which \nshe was invested as a Bard of  the Gorseth in 2005), \nrather than New York. Metier\u2019s disc features eight \ninstrumental works, written between 1987 and \n2004, presented chronologically and framed by \nmusic inspired by the deaths of  the composer\u2019s \nmother (the String Quartet) and her long-time \npartner (Light). All the works tend to the brief, \nonly one \u2013 Light \u2013 reaching to the teens of  minutes; \nand of  their 26 movements only two, the opening \nspans of  the Quartet and the piano suite The Towers \nof  San Gimignano (1993), extend past five minutes \nin duration. (Half  of  them last less than two.) A \nvariety of  standard genres are represented, from \nclarinet quintet, quartets (strings and clarinet-\nviolin-cello-piano: Visions of  Hildegard, 2001), \nstring trio (The Egloshayle Nightingale Trio and \nMicrominiature No. 2), piano trio (Microminiature \nNo. 1, although Light is a variant, swapping cello \nfor viola), cello-and-piano (Aquamarine Waltz, \n1999) and solo piano.\nFor the most part, Bailey\u2019s music is quiet and \nreflective, tonally based (often diatonic), the \ntextures often spare and atmospheric. Extra-\nmusical resonances abound, though none are \ndeclared for the Clarinet Quintet (1993), featuring \nthe composer\u2019s own instrument. Its brevity \n(lasting here a little past eight minutes) may \nseem unduly lightweight when compared to the \nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ncd reviews 95\nstandard repertoire (think Brahms, Reger, even \nHindemith) or indicative of  a short-windedness \nin Bailey\u2019s ideas. Rather, I see this work as being a \nsonatina next to such pieces, the three miniature \nmovements exploring the basic texture of  the \nmedium and enjoying themselves while they do \nso. Of  more weight is The Towers of  San Gimignano, \ninspired by the famous Tuscan town, its first two \nmovements the finest music on the disc. The \nfinale, however, while pleasing enough, does not \nquite match what has gone before, as if  ghosting \nin from another piece.\nAll the works here sound grateful to play, \nallowing the performers plenty of  scope for \nexpression and direct communication with \ntheir audiences, unclouded by the complexities \nof  compositional isms. Not that Bailey\u2019s music \nis undemanding per se, as the graver sections \nof  Light show, with their subtle shadings and \nalternations of  light and dark weaving a moving \ntapestry of  grief, loss and consolation. In the \ntwo Microminiatures (2000) \u2013 deliberately \nwritten to play for 3\u20134 minutes \u2013 the remit for \nthe commission was for tiny works for amateur \nperformers; note the late-Shostakovich-like \nmomentum of  No 2\u2019s final Allegro. If  slight in size \nthey are not unengaging to hear. While heavenly \nlength is no guarantee of  musical profundity, it is \ntrue that only the three-movement Quartet and \nfour-span Light really punch above their weight. \nThe performances, by the members of  the Davey \nChamber Ensemble, for whom several of  the \nworks were written, are generally acceptable \nalthough there are some problems of  intonation \nin the larger-ensemble works, particularly in the \nAdagio of  the String Quartet and the opening of  \nVisions of  Hildegard, the latter a nicely-worked, \nundemanding variation-fantasy on a theme by the \nmedieval Abbess of  Bingen. Metier\u2019s recording, \nmade in Bath Spa University in 207, is clear if  very \nclose-miked (almost claustrophobic), not allowing \nmuch room for the music to breathe.\nFor those unfamiliar with the term \u2018acousmatic \nmusic\u2019 (broadly, music which one cannot see \nbeing played: so theoretically including any \nrecorded medium), Natasha Barrett\u2019s Trade \nWinds (2004\u20136) is a good example, a 52-minute \ncomposition inspired by the ocean and specifically \nits \u2018vast expanse\u2019. Its eight movements \u2013 Opening, \nSubmerged, Open Ocean, Mobilis in Mobili (inspired \nby Jules Verne\u2019s 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea: this \nmovement can be played separately), Deep Layer, \nPlanctonic Float, Migration and Nordfjorden Shore \n\u2013 are constructed from a variety of  pre-recorded \nelements, concr\u00e8te sounds of  the sea and sea birds, \norgan chords, the soprano Jane Manning, a roof-\nraising but all-too-brief  sea shanty (performed \nwith gusto by the Storm Weather Shanty Choir) \nand reminiscences from the retired Norwegian \ntrawler captain, Jon Warhuus (spelled Varhus on \nthe composer\u2019s website), concerning a perilous \njourney to the Aleutian Islands during a Pacific \nstorm.\nThe Nordic resonances are to be expected, \nas Barrett has been resident in Britain\u2019s north-\neasterly neighbour for a decade, and the landscape \nand culture of  Norway are closely bound up with \nher work \u2013 a fact recognized in the award of  the \nNordic Council\u2019s Music Prize to her in 2006. Trade \nWinds was commissioned by NoTAM with funds \nprovided by the Norwegian Composers\u2019 Fund \nand Norwegian Cultural Council and in structure \nresembles a large-scale tone poem or suite, highly \ndescriptive of  the sea and at times elemental in \nits power. The use of  spoken Norwegian is not \nan issue for non-Norwegian speakers as it is as \nmuch the texture and sonority of  the voice that \nis important as the spoken words themselves; \nAurora provide a full translation in English in the \nbooklet nonetheless. \nThe recording presents in SACD format a \nstereophonic representation of  Barrett\u2019s original \n16-channel concert version (which has a video \nelement created by Marianne Selsjord), which \nused antiphonally placed speakers to maximize \nspatial separation. Although there is some loss of  \neffect on disc compared to the concert version, \nAurora\u2019s recording presents an otherwise faithful \nrepresentation of  Barrett\u2019s central vision.\nPersuasion is the title track of  a new Phono \nSuecia release devoted to orchestral music by \nthe Swedish composer Britta Bystr\u00f6m (b. 1977). \nCommissioned for a conducting composition, the \nallusion to Jane Austen\u2019s novel is deliberate (indeed, \nliterature is a key starting-point for several of  the \nworks in the programme) and translates into a \nmetaphor for the novel where the conductor-cum-\nsuitor attempts to \u2018convince the orchestra about \nhis intentions\u2019. It is a curious conceit but, alas, not \nentirely persuasive. To most, Persuasion (2004) will \nsound like a moderately-paced, abstract orchestral \ntoccata with a nicely balanced middle section, not \nillustrative of  its external source. By contrast, the \npercussion concerto The Baron in the Trees (2000\u2013\n1) \u2013 derived from Italo Calvino\u2019s comic novel \n\u2013 is more readily un der standable as translating the \nessence of  the book in the relationship between \nthe soloist and orchestra, in a way similar to a \npictorial representation, although the latter is \nnecessarily of  a single point in time. Eschewing \nwooden percussion for the most part, the soloist\u2019s \nmetallic sounds give the music a brittle, fragile \nfeeling that proves adaptable to both swift-paced \nand leisurely music.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ntempo96\nHaydn is the point of  origin for the delightful \nFarewell Variations (2005), although only by \nexample, as the theme which is the basis of  the 14 \nhighly contrasted and often amusing variations \nis of  Bystr\u00f6m\u2019s own invention. The theme and \nits treatments are not Haydnesque, either, even \nthough the titles of  the variations recall the titles \n(however apocryphally assigned) of  many of  the \nsymphonies. It is a delightful piece and would \nmake a splendid concert opener. So would A Study \nin Scarlet (1996). Tony Lundman\u2019s notes are a \ntouch apologetic about this vigorous if  somewhat \nstylistically anonymous diptych for string \norchestra. What Lundman hears as impatience, \nrawness and agitation in this apprentice piece \n(her graduation was still some years away), I view \nrather as verve, inexperience perhaps in filtering \ninfluences, and sheer delight in the medium. By \ncontrast, Sera (2002), Bystr\u00f6m\u2019s graduation piece, \nshows a considerable increase in refinement and \norchestral sensitivity. This \u2018journey through \ndifferent musical landscapes, always in the evening \nlight\u2019 is, for want of  a better term, a tone poem in \na long line of  orchestral expositions of  evening. \nAs befits the subject, the toccata-like momentum \nof  Persuasion and A Study in Scarlet is absent, the \nflow more reminiscent of  an inter-related series \nof  photographs or paintings. There\u2019s quick music \naplenty, but beneath the surface activity the \nharmonic pulse is mostly rather slow if  not static. \nHannu Koivula directs sterling performances \nthroughout from the V\u00e4ster\u00e5s Sinfonietta, \nproviding excellent support to percussionist \nMika Takehara and, in the radiant final aria from \nBystr\u00f6m\u2019s opera If  You Lose Your Luggage (2003), \nsoprano Agneta Eichenholz. The aria, which \nconcludes the programme, reveals a lyricism not \noverly represented elsewhere in the couplings. \nPhono Suecia\u2019s sound is first-rate.\nGuy Rickards\nrodion shchedrin: The Sealed Angel. Marie Macklin \n(sop), Fiona Mackay (alto), Benedict Hymas (ten), \nEmma Walshe (sop), Nina Kanter (alto), Choir of  \nGonville & Caius College, Cambridge, Choir of  King\u2019s \nCollege, London, c. Geoffrey Webber, David Trendell. \nDelphian DCD34067.\nAs a child Rodion Shchedrin attended a choir \nschool in Moscow, set up in 1944 on the direct \ninstructions of  Stalin. Shchedrin describes grow-\ning up singing sacred music by Bach, Haydn and \nSchubert given new, state-approved texts \u2018about \nthe wonderful weather, the birds singing, the \ngrass growing, praising the Motherland \u2013 just ter-\nrible\u2019. Shchedrin had long intended to make his \ncontribution to the Russian choral literature but, \nwhen the music was finished in 1988, he knew that \nto use his preferred title, Russian Liturgy, would \nmean that \u2018it would not have left my desk, despite \nperestroika\u2019. So this contemplative setting of  Old \nSlavonic prayers instead became The Sealed Angel, \nwith passages from the Leskov novel of  that name \nread between the nine musical movements. The \npiece duly received the Russian State Prize from \nBoris Yeltsin in 1992, and has been widely per-\nformed around the world.\nThe music has the smooth melodic con-\ntours and consonant modality of  Russian \nchurch music. Firmly in the tradition of  the set-\ntings of  the Liturgy of  St John Chrysostom by \nRachmaninov and Tchaikovsky, The Sealed Angel \nhas a similar ambience to that of  the sacred works \nof  Shchedrin\u2019s near contemporaries P\u00e4rt and \nG\u00f3recki. Largely slow and subdued, The Sealed \nAngel eschews the playfulness or eccentricity of  \nmuch of  Shchedrin\u2019s output for sincere expres-\nsiveness. There are only occasional outbursts, \nsuch as in the dramatic fourth movement, with its \nglissandos and foot-stamping. More typical is the \ngentle chorale that bookends the piece, wordless, \nwistful and affecting.\nThe singing of  the combined choirs of  Gonville \n& Caius, Cambridge and King\u2019s College, London \nis warm and well blended, but perhaps too polite \nto put enough bite into the Russian consonants. \nThe only instrumental accompaniment is an obbli-\ngato oboe, representing a flute-like Russian folk \ninstrument and, by extension, the whole Russian \npeople. Dancing lithely around the slowly tread-\ning music, Clare Wills\u2019s playing is one of  the \nhighlights of  the recording, especially in the elu-\nsive solo movement at the centre of  the piece.\nBernard Hughes\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe Cambridge Journals Digital Archive\ncontains more than 160 journals, more than \n3 million pages and more than 8 million \nlinked references.
