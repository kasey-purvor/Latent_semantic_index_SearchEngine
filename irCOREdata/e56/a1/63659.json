These have concentrated\nmostly on the mechanisms involved in the hybridiz-\nation process and the role of hybridization in\nevolution (Arnold, 1997). Studies have looked at the\nbarriers to gene flow (Grant, 1949; Bouck et al., 2005) or\nthe composition of the resultant vegetation as a result\nof gene flow, e.g. the production of hybrid swarms\n(Arnold, 1994). Others have described potential rare\nplant extinction due to demographic swamping and\ngenetic assimilation by a common congener (Levin\net al., 1996), or predicted species displacement (Wolf\net al., 2001).\nSeed-bank studies in natural or semi-natural\nvegetation types are usually related to their use in\nhabitat re-creation and restoration (Mitchell et al.,\n1998; Pywell et al., 2002; Bossuyt and Hermy, 2003;\nAllison and Ausden, 2006), or for the conservation of\nrare species (Fischer and Matthies, 1998). The relative\nfitness of seeds and seedling genotypes of known\nprovenance from a hybrid zone has been investigated\nexperimentally by Johnston et al. (2003). However,\nthere are no studies that examine the effects of\nhybridization on the species composition of naturally\noccurring soil seed banks. This study examines the\nsmall-scale variation in the seed-bank structure of a\ndwarf shrub, heathland vegetation type that is\ncharacterized by the abundance of two closely related\nErica species and their hybrids.\nErica tetralix and Erica ciliaris, the parent species,\nhave overlapping geographical distributions. E. ciliaris\nis a rare plant in the British Isles (Wigginton, 1999),\nwhere it is at the northern limit of its European range\nin south-west England (Rose et al., 1996). The hybrid\nErica \u00a3 watsonii is a naturally occurring cross between\nErica ciliaris and Erica tetralix. The breeding system of\nE. ciliaris and E. tetralix creates an F1 generation of\nhybrids with low pollen viability and high seed\nsterility (Gay, 1957). The hybrid is found in all areas\nand habitats where the two parent species coexist in\ncontinental Europe (Neyraut, 1900) and Britain\n(Perring and Sell, 1968; Stace, 1975). In south-west\nEngland, both species and the hybrid co-occur on a\nseries of acidic soils that range from dry, free-draining\nmineral soil to waterlogged, organic peat soil. These\nsoils support heath and mire vegetation, which\ncorresponds to the H3 (Ulex minor\u2013Agrostis curtisii\n*Correspondence\nFax: \u00fe44 1305 213600\nEmail: rjr@ceh.ac.uk\nSeed Science Research (2007) 17, 201\u2013210 DOI: 10.1017\/S0960258507782855\nheath), M16 (Ericetum tetralicis wet heath) and M21\n(Narthecio\u2013Sphagnetum valley mire) plant commu-\nnities of Rodwell (1991). The plants of both species are\nmost abundant on the wetter heaths (M16), where they\nare characteristically co-dominant with mixtures of\nCalluna vulgaris, the grass Molinia caerulea and the bog\nmosses Sphagnum compactum and S. tennellum. The\nflowering periods for each species show similar\npatterns. The first flowers of E. tetralix open in May,\nand those of E. ciliaris appear in June. The peak\nflowering is in early July for E. tetralix and early\nAugust for E. ciliaris. Flowering continues into\nSeptember for E. tetralix and late October for E. ciliaris.\nHybrid plants can be found flowering throughout the\nflowering period of the two parent species, and they\nhave an intermediate flowering peak. The majority of\nflowers of both species and the hybrid are produced\nbetween July and September.\nThe species composition of heathland soil seed\nbanks does not always reflect the species composition\nof the above-ground vegetation (Pakeman and\nMarshall, 1997; Valbuena and Trabaud, 2001). This\ncan be due to a number of biological and environ-\nmental factors, such as: seed production, seed long-\nevity, predation, soil conditions and vegetation\nmanagement. Seed-bank composition can be an\nimportant factor in the species composition of\nrecovering vegetation following extreme events, such\nas fire and drought (Valbuena and Trabaud, 2001;\nOdion and Tyler, 2002) or soil disturbance (Britton\net al., 2000). Many plants of the Ericaceae, especially the\nErica spp., produce seeds that can persist in the soil for\nmany years, building up a considerable and long-\nlived seed bank (type IV seed bank of Thompson and\nGrime, 1979; long-term persistent in Thompson et al.,\n1997). It is also important to consider the residual seed\nbank when making decisions on the suitability of sites\nfor habitat restoration (Walker et al., 2004a, b).\nSoil moisture and groundwater depths can have an\neffect on soil seed-bank survival. By raising the\ngroundwater from 30 cm below the surface to 5 cm\nbelow the surface for 3 years, significant differences in\nboth species composition and individual species\nnumbers in a wet meadow seed bank have been\nreportedbyBekker et al. (1998). The soil conditions in the\nthree vegetation communities in this study varied from\naerobic throughout most of the year on the relatively\nfree-draining humid heathland (H3) sites, to seasonally\ninundated wet heathland (M16) and to permanently\nanaerobic, waterlogged soils of the M21 mire.\nIn heterogeneous vegetation types, such as those\nwhere there is an intimate mix of both parent plants\nand their hybrids, the method of seed dispersal can\nhave an effect on the small-scale distribution of seeds\nwithin a seed bank. Local variations in seed densities\nrelated to dispersal have been demonstrated by Eshel\net al. (2000) for Pinus halepensis. The dispersal of the\nseeds of E. cinerea has been measured (Bullock and\nClarke, 2000). Their results showed that, although\nlong-range dispersal and colonization of new sites is\npossible, most of the seeds produced by a heather\nplant fall within a radius of 1m of its own centre. This\nspecies of heather has a similar growth form and seed\nsize to E. ciliaris and E. tetralix, (see Bannister, 1965,\n1966; Rose et al., 1996). Thus, both E. ciliaris and\nE. tetralix have no specific seed-dispersal mechanisms,\nand are likely to exhibit locally variable seed-bank\nseed densities that are dependent on the above-\nground vegetation composition.\nOn the Dorset heaths, there are patches of\nheathland vegetation with differing proportions\nof these two Erica species and the hybrid on a range\nof different vegetation types, based on the local\nhydrological conditions. Heathland vegetation con-\nsists primarily of dwarf shrubs interspersed with\ngrasses, forming a dense vegetation canopy. In mature\nvegetation stands, there is also a ground layer of\nbryophytes or litter, consisting of dead plant material.\nUnder these conditions, seed germination and seed-\nling establishment are rare, and gaps for seedling\ngrowth tend to occur only following disturbance\nevents, such as a fire, physical disturbance of the soil\nby animals or by anthropogenic activities, such as\nafforestation. Historical information on pre-afforesta-\ntion and pre-fire vegetation and hybrid composition\nenabled this study to compare the relative compo-\nsition of the Erica spp. in the seed bank with that of the\nexisting vegetation types, and to see if this varies with\nsoil conditions and site history. The results of this\nwork will help us to understand the current\ndistribution of the different genotypes and to predict\nthe possible changes that may result from different\nforms of management.\nMaterials and methods\nThe species and study sites\nE. ciliaris and E. tetralix, the two parent species, are\nclosely related (to sub-genus). They are similar in\ngrowth form, and where they co-occur, they are\npartially co-flowering, with the E. tetralix flowering\nseason peaking in early July and that of E. ciliaris\npeaking in August. The corollas are of similar shape:\nE. ciliaris tubular\u2013urceolate and E. tetralix ovoid\u2013\nurceolate; length: E. ciliaris 8\u201310mm and E. tetralix\n6\u20138mm; and colour: E. ciliaris dark rose and E. tetralix,\npink. They share the same floral visitors (in particular\nbumblebees) and are likely to share the same\nmechanisms of cross-pollination (Bannister, 1966;\nRose et al., 1996).\nThis study was carried out on the Purbeck Heaths\nin Dorset, south-west England. This area contains the\nR.J. Rose202\nmajority of the remaining British sites for E. ciliaris.\nWithin this area, much of its former range has been\nlost to conifer plantations and some to agricultural\nconversion. However, there remain large populations\nwithin National Nature Reserves and Sites of Special\nScientific Interest.\nSite selection was based on the surveys of the\ndistribution of E. ciliaris in 1973 (Chapman, 1975) and\n1987 (Chapman and Rose, 1994). Information on the\nextent of the heathland and history of the vegetation\nstructure in each site was extracted from the Dorset\nHeathland Survey database records for 1978 and 1987\n(see Rose et al., 2000). Sites were chosen on the basis of\nthe presence of a population of each Erica species and\nthe hybrid, a range of heathland vegetation types that\ncorrespond to the three plant communities \u2013 H3, M16\nand M21 \u2013 mentioned above, i.e. humid heath, wet\nheath and peatland (see Chapman et al., 1989 for\nvegetation definitions), and a constancy of heathland\narea between survey dates. By using the vegetation\ngrowth phase data from the Dorset Heathland Survey\ndatabase (see Rose et al., 2000), the selected sites could\nbe divided into two groups, those that had been burnt\nin the period 1975\u20131985 and those that had not.\nAdditional sets of former E. ciliaris sites within conifer\nplantations were also sampled. These sites were\nafforested between 1965 and 1968, but were recorded\nby Chapman (1975) as being \u2018former heathland\u2019 with\nyoung conifers in 1973.\nVegetation and habitat description\nIn this study, the seed banks of heathland with three\ndifferent management histories were assessed:\nafforested former heathland that had had no seed\ninput for many (.20) years; undisturbed heathland\nwith a continual seed input for more than 35 years;\nand disturbed heathland where the seed bank had\nbeen removed or severely reduced by burning 20\nyears ago, but was gradually increasing as the\nvegetation returned to the mature growth phase.\nWithin each site, 2m \u00a3 2m areas of humid heath, wet\nheath and peatland vegetation with a high proportion\nof Erica cover (sites with a minimum 30% estimated\ncover in each of the three; 1978, 1987 and 1996 Dorset\nHeathland Surveys) were selected for sampling. These\nwere divided into three types: dominant E. ciliaris,\ndominant hybrid or dominant E. tetralix, giving nine\ncombinations of vegetation type and Erica cover. Few\nindividual heathland sites had examples of all nine\ncambinations. Therefore, a total of 13 heathland sites\nwere used (seven disturbed, six undisturbed).\nIn addition, five afforested former heathland sites\nwere sampled. For these sites within the conifer\nplantations, nine sample quadrat locations were\nselected at random from within the known former\nrange of E. ciliaris [mapped by Chapman in 1963, but\nrecorded as reduced or absent in 1973; see Chapman\n(1975) for details]. Table 1 shows the site numbers of\neach sample heathland type.\nSeed-bank and vegetation sampling\nThe sampling period was restricted to the mid-July\nand early August period. This coincided with the\nmid-point between the peak flowering times of the\ntwo species, allowing accurate floristic assessments of\nthe relative abundance of the three genotypes to be\nmade.\nThe total cover of Erica within a randomly selected\n2m \u00a3 2m quadrat was estimated by sub-dividing the\narea into 16 plots of 0.5m \u00a3 0.5m and assessing the\nTable 1.

The 16 plot estimates\nwere averaged to give a quadrat cover estimate.\nThe proportions of each of the Erica species and the\nhybrid plants in each plot were assessed by taking the\nErica flowering spike nearest the centre of the plot and\ntallying its hybrid score (see below for methodology).\nWhere no Erica occurred within a plot, no sample was\ntaken. The results of these hybrid evaluations were\nthen combined to give values for the whole quadrat.\nFrom this, quadrats were grouped according to the\ndominant hybrid evaluation.\nThe seed bank in each quadrat was sampled by\ntaking 16 soil cores, one from the centre of each plot.\nThe samples were taken using a 24-mm diameter\ncorer. Thus, the total area sampled in each plot was\n7239mm2, giving a minimum detectable seed-bank\nsize of 103 seedsm22.The sampling depth was 50mm.\nThis depth was chosen because 95% of the seed bank\noccurs in the top 50mm of the soil profile in\nundisturbed heathland soils (Gillham, 1980; Pywell\net al., 1997; Odion and Tyler, 2002).\nSeed-bank germination\nThe soil cores fromeach sub-plotwere bulked, airdried\nand sieved to remove twigs, stones and the larger roots.\nThe sample was then spread to a depth of ,0.5mm\nover the surface of a 300-mm diameter flowerpot filled\nwith soil of heathland origin (butwith no residual seed\nbank). In addition, 13 \u2018control pots\u2019 containing only the\nheathland soil were included in the experimental\ndesign. The pots were then randomized and placed on\na 16 \u00a3 8 grid in a gravel-filled plunge bed with a\nconstant water table at 15 cm below the soil surface.\nThiswas chosen as anaveragewater-tabledepth for the\nrange of hydrological situations from which the\nsamples had been taken. Thus, optimum conditions\nfor seedling emergence of both E. tetralix and E. ciliaris\nwere created (ter Heerdt et al., 1999).\nThegermination of both species occurs in the spring\nand autumn (Rose et al., 1996). The number of\ngerminating seedlings was monitored between\nautumn 1995 and spring 1997 (four germination\nseasons) by marking seedling germination positions\nwith short lengths of coloured wire. The seedlings of\nplant species other than theErica specieswere removed\nas soon as it could be established that they were not\nErica spp. At the end of the germination period, the\nnumbers of seedlings and marker wires (indicating\nwhere seedlings had perished)were counted to give an\noverall estimate of the Erica seed-bank size.\nSeedling identification\nDuring the germination period, a sub-sample of\nseedlings was taken to assess their hybrid scores.\nSixteen individual plants were selected at random\nfrom each pot and grown until they produced flowers.\nWhere fewer than 16 seedlings were present, all\nseedlings were used. Few plants produced flowers in\nthe first year; therefore, this procedure was continued\nduring the summers of 1998, 1999 and 2000 until all\nplants had flowered and could be scored for both\nvegetative and floral characters (see below).\nDetermination of the hybrid index\nThe method for hybrid characterization was that used\nby Chapman (1975), modified from the system\ndeveloped by Gay (1960). Nine morphological\nfeatures were scored: 0 for the typical E. ciliaris form\nof the character; 1 for typical E. tetralix form of the\ncharacter; and 1\/2 for intermediate forms. The hybrid\nindices were summed for each individual. The plants\nwere classified into pure E. ciliaris, hybrid and\nE. tetralix using the rules set out by Chapman (1975).\nPlants with hybrid indices ,3 were deemed to be\nE. ciliaris, those with hybrid indices from 3 to 6\n(inclusive) were hybrid plants, and those with hybrid\nindices .6 were E. tetralix.\nStatistical analysis\nFor the analyses, the total seedling numbers were\ncalculated as the number of germinating seedlings\nm22.The number of E. ciliaris, E. tetralix and hybrid\nseedlings was estimated by multiplying the\nproportion of each group of seedlings grown in each\nsample by the total number of seedlings in that\nsample. The data were normally distributed. Simple\nlinear regression was used to analyse the relationship\nbetween the vegetative abundance and the size of the\nseed bank of each genotype.\nDifferent heathland sites, burning histories,\nvegetation types and the percentage cover of each\nErica in the vegetation, factors that may affect the\ndensity of seeds in the seed bank of the three\ngenotypes, were assessed using general linear models\n(GLM) for unbalanced nested data. Specifically, in the\nbetween-site analysis, differences between the\nsite types (burnt against unburnt) were tested; in\nthe residual within-site analysis, effects of vegetation\ntype (humid heath, wet heath or peatland) and\nremaining effects of percentage cover of each Erica\n(treated as covariates) on the seed density were tested.\nTwo sample t-tests were used to compare the seed-\nbank size of the three vegetation types with those of\nthe afforested soils.\nR.J. Rose204\nResults\nHybrid composition of the vegetation and seed\nbank\nNo Erica seedlings grew in any of the 13 control pots in\nthe seed-bank study. Thus, any possibility of\ncontamination of the samples, either by a residual\nEricaceous seed bank in the propagation medium or\nby aerial inputs of seed, can be discounted.\nBoth E. ciliaris and E. tetralix were common in the\nvegetation at all the heathland sites used in this study,\nand the seeds of both species were found in the seed\nbanks at each site. Hybrid plants occurred in both the\nvegetation samples taken and the seed banks at 12 of\nthe 13 heathland sites used in this study. Figure 1\nshows that the size of the seed bank of both E. ciliaris\nand E. tetralix within the 4m2 plot is significantly and\npositively related to the species abundance in the\nvegetation of heathland sites. In contrast, there was no\nsignificant association between the numbers of hybrid\nseeds in the seed bank and the vegetative hybrid\nabundance. These relationships are further explored\nbelow (Table 2).\nThe overall distribution of hybrid index scores in\nthe sample vegetation is given in Fig. 2a. The main\ncharacteristics were: large proportions of \u2018pure\u2019 plants\n(high and low scores), some mid-range scores\n(representing the central range of the hybrids), and\nvery few scores that were intermediate or edge of\nrange between the pure and hybrid plants. This\nfollows a pattern similar to that found in a selection of\n30 E. ciliaris sites, where individual plants of E. ciliaris,\nE. tetralix and hybrids were sampled randomly and\nscored for their hybrid index number (see Chapman,\n1975). By combining the hybrid index scores into three\ncategories (E. ciliaris, E. tetralix and hybrids), the total\nof 1388 plants scored fell into approximately equal\nproportions. This was partly due to the sampling\nprocedure, which selected equal numbers of sites\ndominated by each of the genotypes.\nThe distribution of hybrid scores in the seed bank\n(Fig. 2b) did not reflect the distribution of scores in\nthe vegetation. Of the 1491 seedlings produced from\nthe seeds, most were classified as one of the two pure\nspecies. There were relatively few seeds that produced\nplants classified as hybrid [111 (7.4%)], whereas there\nwere 455 E. ciliaris plants (30.6%) and 925 E. tetralix\nplants (62.0%). These proportions should be compared\nwith the relative proportions of cover of the three\ngenotypes found in the vegetation of the sample\nquadrats (E. ciliaris, 30.3% cover; E. tetralix, 37.1%; and\nthe hybrid, 32.5%). Furthermore, while the vegetation\nsamples showed an obvious peak in the mid-range of\nFigure 1. Linear regressions of Erica spp. seed-bank size on the proportion of each species in the vegetation (circles \u00bc E. ciliaris,\nr 2 \u00bc 46.5%, P \u00bc 0.000; squares \u00bc hybrid, r 2 \u00bc 0.9%, P \u00bc 0.180; diamonds \u00bc E. tetralix, r 2 \u00bc 41.7%, P \u00bc 0.000).\nEffects of hybridization on seed-bank composition of Erica ciliaris 205\nscores (Fig. 2a), there was no peak in the hybrid range\nof the seed-bank plants (Fig. 2b), and there was an\napparent skewing of the plant numbers towards\nE. tetralix and hybrids that havemore characteristics in\ncommon with E. tetralix.\nThe average number of E. ciliaris seeds in the total\nseed-bank sample was 1165 seedsm22. The mean\ndensity for hybrids was 275 seedsm22 and for E.\ntetralix 2350 seedsm22. The size of the seed bank at the\ndifferent heathland sites did not differ significantly,\nand there was no effect of either vegetation type or\nburning history (Table 2). However, there was an\ninteraction effect on hybrid seed-bank size between the\nburning history and vegetation type. In the heathland\nsites with a burning history, peatland was the\nvegetation type with the smallest seed bank (in 4 out\nof 5 cases), whereas in the unburnt sites, peatland had\nthe largest seed bank on average (in 2 out of 5 cases).\nThe sizes of both the E. ciliaris and E. tetralix seed banks\nwere strongly related to the percentage cover of each\nspecies in the vegetation. The increasing percentage\ncover ofE. tetralix in the vegetation had a positive effect\non the number of hybrid seeds in the seed bank. The\nsize of the hybrid seed bank was not related to the\nTable 2.

However, there was a strong affinity\nbetween the percentage cover of E. tetralix and the\nseed bank of hybrid seed.\nThe Erica seed bank in afforested sites\nThe sizes of the residual seed banks in the afforested\nsites were compared with the seed banks of the\nheathland sites. Due to the soil disturbance during tree\nplanting, the afforested sites could not be classified\ninto the three heathland vegetation types. Therefore,\ntests were done in combination with each vegetation\ntype individually and in total. Results for each set of\ntests of significance show the same trends (Table 3).\nThe results for E. ciliaris showed that the seed bank in\nthe afforested sites did not differ significantly from the\nopen heathland sites, even though they have had no\nseed input for 20 years or more. The hybrid and\nE. tetralix seed banks had both declined significantly\nfrom 275 seedsm22 and 2350 seedsm22, to\n74 seedsm22 and 995 seedsm22, about 73% and 58%,\nrespectively (Fig. 3).\nDiscussion and conclusions\nComparison with other studies\nThis study has shown that both E. ciliaris and E. tetralix\nhave large and persistent seed banks. A seed-bank\ndatabase (Thompson et al., 1997) lists a number of\nstudies that include E. tetralix, but none for E. ciliaris.\nSome of the findings reported in Thompson et al. (1997)\nsuggest that E. tetralix may only have a transient seed\nbank in some circumstances. However, this work, and\nother lowland heathland studies in Dorset and\nelsewhere in southern England, have confirmed that\nthe seed bank of E. tetralix can persist for many years,\neven if the above-ground vegetation is modified by\nafforestation (Pywell et al., 2002), natural succession\n(Mitchell et al., 1998) and agricultural reclamation\n(Pywell, 1993). The size of the Erica seed banks found\nunder the three vegetation types were generally lower\nthan those found by Pywell et al. (2002) in Calluna\nvulgarisdominateddryheathlandvegetationwithpure\nE. tetralix. However, seed-bank size in this species\nmight be expected to be different due to the variability\nof seed longevity under different soil moisture\nconditions (as recorded by Bekker et al., 1998).\nVegetation type\nWhile there were no significant differences in the size\nof the seed bank of E. ciliaris, E. tetralix or the hybrids\nthat could be attributed to the vegetation type (humid\nheath, wet heath or peatland), the relative sizes of the\nseed banks of the three genotypes showed that the\nproduction of hybrid seed is a relatively rare\noccurrence (6.9% of the total seed bank). The pure\nplants also contributed differing proportions of seeds\nto the seed bank, with E. tetralix contributing 63.4%\nand E. ciliaris the remaining 29.7% in a set of samples\nselected for approximately equal proportions of each\ngenotype in the vegetation. This may be due to\ndifferences in flowering, seed production or seed-bank\nsurvival. Evidence from the afforested sites suggested\nthat the seed-bank survival of E. ciliaris may be greater\nunder those conditions than that of the hybrid or\nTable 3.

The Erica seed-bank size and composition in the\nfour vegetation types (black bars, E. ciliaris; grey bars,\nhybrid; and white bars, E. tetralix).\nEffects of hybridization on seed-bank composition of Erica ciliaris 207\nE. tetralix. From the relative sizes of the seed banks in\nthe natural vegetation, and given the similarities in\nvegetation cover within the experimental areas, the\ndata also imply that the seed production of E. tetralix is\ngreater than that of E. ciliaris.\nBurning history\nThe burning history of the sites had no significant\neffect on the size of the seed bank of either of the pure\nspecies or the hybrids. Therefore, it can be assumed\nthat during a normal management cycle of 25 years\nbetween managed burns, the additional seed rain\nduring the most productive \u2018building phase\u2019 of\nheather re-growth (for details, see Gimingham, 1972)\nwas sufficient to compensate for physical losses\nduring, and immediately after, burning and\nthe reduced seed input in the period of vegetation\nre-growth in subsequent years. Also, the fact that the\nunburnt sites do not have continually increasing seed\nbanks suggests that a maximum seed-bank size has\nbeen reached, with new annual inputs balancing\nlosses to decay, predation and germination.\nThe influence of vegetation cover\nThe percentage cover in the vegetation of the three\ngenotypes influences the composition of the seed bank\n(Table 2). The size of the pure seed bank of both\nE. ciliaris and E. tetralix was positively associated with\nthe percentage cover of the respective species in the\nvegetation, and there was a significant association\nbetween percentage vegetation cover of E. tetralix and\nthe number of hybrid seeds in the seed bank. The\ndistribution of hybrid scores in the seed bank was\nskewed towards the higher (E. tetralix) end of the\nrange of scores. This may be due to E. tetralix being\nmore susceptible to the process of hybridization.\nEvidence for this comes from the fact that there was a\ngreater affinity between the percentage cover of\nE. tetralix and the production of hybrid seeds,\ncompared with E. ciliaris. Further evidence for the\nability of E. tetralix to hybridize comes from the\nformation of other natural hybrids (with E. mackaiana\nand E. vagans) recorded by Stace (1975), but no other\nhybrids of E. ciliaris are known (Rose et al., 1996).\nHybrid index scores and hybrid formation\nThere were differences between both the proportions\nand the distributions of the hybrid index scores for the\nvegetation and the seed bank (shown in Fig. 2a, b). The\nhigh proportion of hybrid plants in the vegetation,\nwhen compared to the seed bank, is due partially to\nthe very low fertility of the hybrid plants, but also\nto the more robust growth form of the hybrids. It is\ncommon that F1 hybrids between closely related\nspecies tend to exceed their parents in vegetative\nvigour or robustness (Grant, 1975) and, thus, the\nvegetative spread of these plants has led to hybrid\ndominance in some areas. The distribution of hybrid\nscores in the seed bank was skewed towards the\nhigher (E. tetralix) end of the range of scores.\nAfforested sites and restoration\nWithin the local range of E. ciliaris, there are a number\nof former sites that were planted with conifers and\nhave been afforested formore than 20 years. This study\nhas shown that there is the potential for restoration of\nthe Erica component of heathland at these afforested\nsites. The residual seed-bank sizes are much higher\nthan the seed addition rates given for heathland\nrestoration (300\u2013500 seedsm22; Putwain and Rae,\n1988). The differences between the genotypes in the\nrates of depletion of germinable seeds in the residual\nseed bank will also have an effect on the species\ncomposition of any restoration site. From this work, it\ncan be expected that a greater proportion of pure\nE. ciliaris seedlings and fewer E. tetralix seedlings will\nbe produced, and the occurrence of hybrid seedlings\nwill be rarer than in the original seed bank, thus aiding\nthe conservation of the rare species (E. ciliaris).\nImplications for the conservation of E. ciliaris\nThe low pollen viability and high seed sterility of the\nhybrids creates a strong postzygotic barrier. Investi-\ngating the risk of extinction through hybridization,\nWolf et al. (2001) simulated mixed populations of\nHelianthus petiolaris and H. annuus, which exhibit\nsimilar postzygotic characteristics to those of E. ciliaris\nand E. tetralix. Where there were no differences in\nsurvivorship between species in a given habitat, one of\nthe parent species always displaced both the other\nspecies and the hybrid plants (Wolf et al., 2001).\nThe conservation of the rare species, E. ciliaris, is\nnot only inextricably linked with habitat preservation\nand management, but also to the hybridization\nrelationship with E. tetralix. In this paper, I was\nunable to show a clear differentiation of habitat\npreferences between these two species along a soil\nmoisture gradient. The work of Wolf et al. (2001)\nwould suggest that one or other of the species or the\nhybrid should become abundant and eventually\ndisplace the others. However, previous studies by\nChapman (1975) have identified more subtle differ-\nences in habitat preference between E. ciliaris and\nE. tetralix, such as vegetation height. This differen-\ntiation in a habitat preference is continually changing\ndue to both managed and unmanaged perturbations,\nR.J. Rose208\nand this may be sufficient to maintain mixed\npopulations at naturally heterogeneous sites. Alter-\nnatively, the progression towards extinction of two of\nthe taxa may be happening at an extremely slow rate,\nbecause the simulation model of Wolf et al. (2001)\npredicts that the process can takemany generations. In\nthis heathland system, individual plants may effec-\ntively live for many years, both by re-sprouting from\nestablished rootstocks after fire and by vegetative\npropagation in the form of layering, when the above-\nground stems become old. The long-lived nature of E.\nciliaris seeds demonstrated in this paper suggests that\ncurrent conservationmanagement trends, i.e. to return\nsome of the afforested, former E. ciliaris sites to\nheathland, are likely to be the most effective and\nbeneficial method of maintaining this rare species.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank Charlene Legg for assistance\nwith scoring the hybrid characteristics of the plants\ngrown on from the seed-bank study; Ralph Clarke for\nstatistical advice; and James Bullock, Ken Thompson\nand an anonymous referee for providing helpful\ncomments on earlier drafts of this paper.\nReferences\nAllison, M. and Ausden, M.
