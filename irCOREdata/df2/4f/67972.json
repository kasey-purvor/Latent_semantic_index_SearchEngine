We also addressed the question of how narrative performance \nvaries in tasks of different cognitive complexity in the written and spoken modes. Our findings \nindicate a complex interaction between aptitude components and task performance under different \nconditions. The components of aptitude that seemed to be most strongly related to the accuracy and \ncomplexity of production were deductive ability and grammatical sensitivity. The results also show \nthat in writing the participants used more varied vocabulary than in speech, but their performance \nwas similar in terms of syntactic complexity. \n 2 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nResearch in the field of second language acquisition (SLA) has long been concerned with the \nquestion of why students show great variation in their language learning success. Studies in this \narea have concluded that individual differences (IDs) are the most important predictors of \nachievement in a second language (L2) (D\u00f6rnyei, 2005). Therefore, it is widely acknowledged that \nIDs have to be taken into consideration both in theoretical accounts of SLA and in practical \npedagogical decision-making. Researchers often point out the necessity of making further advances \ninto uncovering how certain IDs affect and underlie important language learning processes \n(D\u00f6rnyei, 2005; Kormos & S\u00e1f\u00e1r, 2008; Robinson, 2007a). Learner variables are usually divided \ninto cognitive, affective and personality-related IDs (D\u00f6rnyei, 2005). One of the most important \ncognitive variables influencing the success of L2 learning is foreign language aptitude, which is \nassumed to be a conglomerate of cognitive factors that might potentially affect the success of \nlanguage learning (Carroll, 1981). For a long time researchers were interested in the link between \nforeign language aptitude and global language learning outcomes (for reviews see Ehrman & \nOxford, 1995; Grigorenko, Sternberg & Ehrman, 2000). In recent conceptualizations of foreign \nlanguage aptitude, however, it is argued that different cognitive abilities might be useful in different \nphases and processes of language learning (Skehan, 2002) and that learners with different cognitive \nability profiles might benefit from different types of learning tasks and instructional conditions \n(Robinson, 2005a).  \nThe novelty of our study is that we investigated how various components of language \naptitude are related to performance in narrative tasks that differed in their cognitive complexity in \nboth oral and written modes. For this purpose we administered the Hungarian version of the \nlanguage aptitude test and two oral and written tasks to 44 upper-intermediate learners of English in \na Hungarian secondary school. Most studies examining the subtle effects of task characteristics on \nL2 output conclude that in addition to general measures of L2 production, task-specific measures of \nproduction reveal more precise information about how tasks can direct learners\u2019 attention to certain \n 3 \nlinguistic forms and how IDs may differentiate the ways in which learners can benefit from the \nmanipulation of certain task features (e.g., Kormos & Trebits, in press; Norris & Ortega, 2009; \nRobinson 2007b). Therefore, in our study we used both general and specific measures of \nperformance in analyzing students\u2019 output. \nThe present study examines foreign language aptitude in relation to the cognitive demands \nof performing oral and written narrative tasks of different cognitive complexity. Therefore, we first \ndiscuss conceptualizations of foreign language aptitude and then review research on communicative \ntasks and task features with an emphasis on the construct of task complexity. Next, we give a brief \nsummary of research on modality differences in task performance. Finally, we present the results of \nprevious studies which have investigated the influence of IDs on language produced in different \ntasks. \n \nLanguage learning aptitude \n \nForeign language (L2) aptitude is considered to be one of the best predictors of language learning \nsuccess (Abrahamsson & Hyltenstam, 2008; D\u00f6rnyei, 2005; Nikolov & Ott\u00f3, 2006; Sawyer & \nRanta, 2001).  Carroll (1981) identified four components of language aptitude: i) phonetic coding \nability, that is, the \u201cability to identify distinct sounds, to form associations between those sounds \nand symbols representing them, and to retain these associations\u201d; ii) grammatical sensitivity, that is, \nthe ability \u201cto recognize the grammatical functions of words (or other linguistic entities) in sentence \nstructures\u201d; iii) rote learning ability, defined as \u201cthe ability to learn associations between sounds and \nmeanings rapidly and efficiently, and to retain these associations\u201d; and iv) deductive learning \nability, which is \u201cthe ability to infer or induce the rules governing a set of language materials, given \nsample language materials that permit such inferences\u201d (p. 105). Instruments developed to measure \nlanguage aptitude, such as the Modern Language Aptitude Test (MLAT) (Carroll & Sapon, 1959) \nand Pimsleur\u2019s Language Aptitude Battery (PLAB) (Pimsleur, 1966), test language learners on the \n 4 \nabove mentioned four components (for a review see Abrahamsson & Hyltenstam (2008) and \nRobinson, (2007a)). \nThe Carollian construct of language aptitude was developed in the period when \naudiolingualism was the prevailing language teaching methodology and when language competence \nwas mainly conceived of as grammatical knowledge. New language teaching methodologies (in \nparticular communicative and task-based approaches) aim to foster the acquisition of \ncommunicative competence, which encompasses a wider range of knowledge and abilities than \nlinguistic competence alone. These changes in language teaching methodology and in the \nconceptualization of the goals in language learning have also necessitated a revision and extension \nof the concept of aptitude. In response to this, Robinson (2005a) proposed a dynamic aptitude \nconstruct, in which cognitive resources and abilities are combined into aptitude complexes. In \nRobinson\u2019s (2005b) model, primary abilities include pattern recognition, speed of processing in \nphonological working memory and grammatical sensitivity. These general cognitive abilities, which \nwith the exception of phonological memory, are based on the traditional construct of aptitude, help \nthe so-called second-order abilities. The second-order abilities are specific to language learning and \ninclude noticing the gap, memory for contingent speech, deep semantic processing, memory for \ncontingent text, and metalinguistic rule rehearsal.  \nRobinson (2005b) also argued that explicit and implicit learning conditions might require \ndifferent combinations of cognitive abilities. In his study, which investigated the role of aptitude in \ndifferent learning conditions, he found a weak link between aptitude and outcomes in implicit \nlearning conditions and a strong relationship between aptitude and learning under explicit \nconditions. De Graaff\u2019s (1997) research, however, indicated that grammatical sensitivity and the \nability to infer the meanings of words from a text were positively related to attainment in an \nartificial grammar learning experiment under both explicit and implicit conditions. Skehan (2002) \nalso suggested that certain components of the traditional construct of aptitude such as grammatical \n 5 \nsensitivity and deductive ability might assist L2 learning in naturalistic contexts, where learners \nhave few opportunities to acquire L2 linguistic rules through explicit explanation.  \nFrom this brief review of recent research on aptitude it is apparent that several of the \ncomponents of the original construct of aptitude as defined by Carroll might be relevant underlying \ncognitive abilities that promote language learning success even in today\u2019s foreign language \nclassrooms. Deductive learning ability and grammatical sensitivity might help learners recognize \nlinguistic patterns in the communicative input, whereas rote learning ability might be one of the \nsignificant predictors of the success of vocabulary acquisition. Phonetic coding ability might also \nplay an important role in the acquisition of the phonological system of the L2 and in L2 reading, in \nwhich one of the key abilities is phonological awareness (for a recent review see Grabe, 2009).  It \nseems to be important to examine, however, not only how aptitude contributes to the overall success \nof language learning, but also to analyze how students with different cognitive abilities perform in \ncommunicative tasks that they commonly encounter in the process of L2 learning.  \n \nTask complexity \nCognitive abilities do not only assist in the acquisition of L2 knowledge, but they might also \ninfluence how learners utilize their acquired knowledge in performing different types of tasks. \nConsequently, it is important to investigate the relationships between the combination of abilities \nunderlying L2 aptitude and the cognitive demands of pedagogic tasks (Robinson, 2005a). Such \nresearch aims to contribute to an understanding of how best to match learners with strengths in \ncertain cognitive abilities to particular types of learning tasks by examining the interplay between \nthe processing demands of pedagogic tasks and the components of aptitude. As cognitive processes \nmay be closely linked to various features of task design (e.g., the availability of planning time, Ellis, \n2005; Foster & Skehan, 1996; Yuan & Ellis, 2003, or the number of elements included in the task, \nKuiken & Vedder, 2007), the findings of research on the interaction of individual difference factors \n 6 \nand task complexity may be used to inform pedagogic decisions in materials development and \nsyllabus design. \nOne of the most important issues in research on language learning tasks concerns the \ninfluence of task complexity on task performance. In Robinson\u2019s (2001b) definition, \u201ctask \ncomplexity is the result of attentional, memory, and other information processing demands imposed \nby the structure of the task on the language learner\u201d (p. 29). Robinson lists a number of task \ncharacteristics such as the number of elements, availability of planning time and prior knowledge, \nwhich influence the complexity of the task. In the case of speaking tasks, however, it would also be \nimportant to relate the complexity demands of tasks to the different stages of speech production. In \nLevelt\u2019s (1989) model, speech production has four important components, which follow each other \nin this order: (1) conceptualization, that is, planning what one wants to say; (2) formulation, which \nincludes the grammatical, lexical and phonological encoding of the message; (3) articulation, in \nother words, the production of speech sounds, and (4) self-monitoring, which involves checking the \ncorrectness and appropriateness of the produced output. In first language (L1) production \nconceptualizing the message requires attention, whereas formulation and articulation are automatic, \nand hence processing mechanisms can work in parallel, which makes L1 speech generally smooth \nand fast. In the case of non-balanced bilinguals and less proficient L2 speakers, however, \nformulation and articulation are often not sufficiently automatic and require conscious attention, \nwhich frequently hinders parallel processing. \nTask complexity is generally considered to derive from the cognitive demands a task makes \nin the conceptualization stage. This view is based on the assumption that complex concepts require \nthe use of complex syntactic structures, and therefore cognitively complex tasks are complex both \nin terms of conceptualization and linguistic formulation (see e.g. Robinson\u2019s (2001b, 2003, 2005b) \nCognition Hypothesis). It is, however, possible that tasks make separate and independent \ncomplexity demands on the conceptualization and formulation stage. If we consider two speaking \ntasks such as the ones used in the current study \u2500 a cartoon description task, in which the storyline \n 7 \nis given, and a picture narration task, in which students have to narrate their own story \u2500 we can see \nthat different aspects of cognitive complexity make different demands on the learners. In a cartoon \ndescription task, students do not need to conceptualize the content of the story, which eases the \ndemands in the phase of conceptualization, that is, in selecting and ordering the relevant concepts of \ntheir message (Levelt, 1989; Skehan, 2009). Nevertheless, learners have to express the content \nprescribed by the task in whatever linguistic resources they have available in the L2, which \nincreases the processing load in the linguistic encoding phase of speech production. In a story \nnarration task, however, learners need to design their own story, but they can tailor it to match their \nlinguistic resources, which results in increased conceptualization effort and a potentially reduced \nload in linguistic encoding. This example illustrates that in certain cases it might be difficult to \norder tasks in terms of cognitive complexity because tasks might make different and non-\ncomparable demands on different phases of language production (see Pallotti (2009) and Skehan, \n(2009) for a similar line of argument). Consequently, it might increase our understanding of task \ncomplexity, if the cognitive demands of tasks were also considered separately for the \nconceptualization and linguistic encoding stages of speech production. \nA key issue in task-based language learning is that in performing a task students need to \ncoordinate the allocation of their attention in order to successfully meet the linguistic demands of \nthe task. This raises questions concerning how attentional resources can be used, coordinated and \ndirected to different aspects of language production during task completion. There are two \ninfluential models of task complexity in this field, which have motivated a great number of studies \nthat examine the effects of manipulating the different dimensions of task complexity on L2 output \nand interaction, and ultimately on L2 learning: Skehan and Foster\u2019s (2001) Limited Attentional \nCapacity Model and Robinson\u2019s (2001b, 2003, 2005b) Cognition Hypothesis. These models make \ncontrasting predictions as to the effect of increasing task complexity along various dimensions on \nL2 performance. Skehan and Foster\u2019s (2001) Limited Attentional Capacity Model views attention \nand memory as limited in capacity; therefore, they suggest that increasing task complexity reduces \n 8 \nthe pool of available attention and memory resources. As a result, some aspects of performance will \nbe attended to while others will not. Skehan and Foster also claim that cognitively more demanding \ntasks draw learners\u2019 attention away from linguistic forms so that enough attention can be paid to the \ncontent of the message (for a recent account of the model see Skehan, 2009).     \nSkehan and Foster\u2019s (2001) model, however, does not consider that attention is selective and \nvoluntary, in other words that one can have volitional control over choosing relevant stimuli and \nignoring irrelevant ones (Allport, 1987; Wickens, 2007). Robinson\u2019s (2001b, 2003, 2005b) \nCognition Hypothesis differs from the Limited Attentional Capacity Model in that it assumes that \nattention is subject to voluntary regulation. In the Cognition Hypothesis, two sets of dimensions of \ncognitive task complexity are distinguished: resource-directing and resource-dispersing dimensions. \nThe resource-directing dimensions of task performance call learners\u2019 attention to the linguistic \nfeatures which are needed to meet task demands (e.g., reference to events happening here and now \nvs. to events taking place then and there), whereas the resource-dispersing dimensions of the task \nact as attentional limitations in determining what aspect of the task can be heeded (e.g., reducing the \npre-task planning time). The Cognition Hypothesis states that sequencing tasks from cognitively \nsimple to complex allows students to progress towards successfully performing real-world target \ntasks. Robinson proposes that increasing task complexity along resource-directing dimensions can \nlead to greater accuracy and grammatical complexity of L2 output because such demands can direct \nlearners\u2019 attention to how the concepts and functions required by the task have to be grammaticized \nusing specific linguistic forms. Increasing complexity along resource-dispersing dimensions, \nhowever, depletes learners\u2019 attention without having the beneficial effect of directing it to any \nspecific linguistic aspect of L2 production.     \nThe hypotheses put forward by the Limited Attentional Capacity model and the Cognition \nHypothesis have received mixed support, which is probably due to the fact that in some tasks, \ncertain characteristics make resource-dispersing attentional demands on learners, whereas others \nsimultaneously draw their attention to certain linguistic aspects of performance. Few studies have \n 9 \nexamined systematically the combined effects of resource-directing and resource-dispersing \nvariables on performance (but see Gilabert, 2005; Iwashita et al., 2001; R\u00e9v\u00e9sz, 2009) although in \nreal-world communicative tasks these two dimensions simultaneously affect performance (for a \nrecent discussion of this issue see Pallotti, (2009)). In our research we did not intend to test the \npredictions of the two conflicting models of task complexity, but we were interested in comparing \ntwo types of tasks which make different conceptualization demands on L2 speakers: a narrative \ntask, in which the learners need to design the plot of the story, and another type of narrative task, in \nwhich they need to linguistically encode a pre-determined storyline. Our aim in using tasks with \ndifferent attentional demands at different stages of speech production was to extend Robinson\u2019s \nCognition Hypothesis (2001b, 2003, 2005b) with respect to complexity demands concerning \nconceptualization and linguistic encoding. \n \nWritten vs. spoken task performance \n \nIn addition to complexity, another key factor to consider with regard to tasks is the mode of \nperformance. Task-based language learning research has traditionally focussed on speaking tasks, \nand considerably fewer studies have investigated how tasks affect second language writing \nprocesses and the product of writing. There are a number of important differences between speaking \nand writing (Biber, 1988; Chafe, 1982), but from the point of view of psycholinguistic processing, \nthe most crucial ones are that writing is usually not as constrained by time and that it is a recursive \nprocess, in which writers plan, linguistically encode their plans and revise them cyclically (Grabe & \nKaplan, 1996). Although the availability of time is not unlimited in writing, writers are under \nsomewhat less pressure than speakers to divide their attention between conceptualizing their \nmessage and linguistically encoding it, which allows for extensive on-line planning, that is, \nplanning the content of the output while giving it a linguistic form (Yuan & Ellis, 2003). In writing, \nthe time spent on planning the message (i.e. pre-task planning) is also integrated in the writing \n 10 \nprocess because writers can devote considerable time to planning the content before starting to \nwrite. Writers also have more attentional resources available for monitoring their output while they \nare encoding it than speakers. \nOnly a few studies have addressed how the mode of performance influences the output \nstudents produce on specific language learning tasks. In a study conducted with learners of French, \nGranfeldt (2008) found that mode did not have an effect on syntactic complexity, but students used \na higher variety of words in writing and were more accurate in speaking than in writing. In Kuiken \nand Vedder\u2019s (2009) research, however, Dutch learners of Italian produced syntactically more \ncomplex language in writing than in speech, but the lexical variety of their spoken and written \noutput did not differ significantly. The contrasting patterns of the findings might be related to the \nresearch design of these studies (i.e., different types of tasks used) and to the fact that different L2s \nand learners with different levels of proficiency were investigated.  \nIn our study, we intended to investigate the effect of mode on performance in two types of \ntasks which pose different conceptualization demands. In our analyses, we focused on differences in \nlexical variety and in global as well as task-specific measures of syntactic complexity and accuracy. \nFurthermore, we were also interested in how learners with different cognitive ability profiles \nperform in these two modes and how various aptitude components are related to the linguistic \nquality of the output in speech and writing. \n \nIndividual differences and task performance \n \nIndividual differences can exert both direct and indirect influence on task performance. Individual \ndifference factors such as anxiety, working memory capacity and aptitude might have a direct effect \non students\u2019 decisions concerning the allocation of their attentional resources and on students\u2019 \nability to handle their attentional limitations. Individual differences, especially those in cognitive \nabilities, might also influence how successfully students acquire particular aspects of linguistic \n 11 \ncompetence. As any performance in a task draws on acquired linguistic abilities, differences in \nunderlying competence caused by individual difference factors are also expected to manifest \nthemselves in task performance. \nFew studies have addressed the issue of how IDs affect communicative task performance in \ngeneral and even fewer studies exist that investigate how the different components of language \naptitude relate to L2 production on tasks of differing cognitive complexity. Robinson (2007b) \nanalyzed how input, processing and output anxiety affected students\u2019 performance on narrative \ntasks that increased in cognitive complexity. His findings indicated that as the tasks became more \ncomplex, the negative correlation between output anxiety and syntactic complexity grew stronger. \nRobinson\u2019s research, however, did not reveal any significant link between anxiety and accuracy and \nfluency of task performance. Niwa (2000) also investigated the relationship between a resource-\ndirecting task aspect of task complexity (simple vs. complex reasoning demands) and three ability \nvariables: intelligence, aptitude and working memory. She found that in the cognitively more \ncomplex task students with higher aptitude and working memory spoke less fluently. She explained \nher findings by arguing that students with high working memory capacity made greater efforts to \nmeet the reasoning and linguistic demands of the more complex task, which negatively affected \ntheir fluency. Kormos and Trebits (in press) also studied the effects of working memory capacity on \nperformance on the same narrative tasks as used in the current study. The finding that students with \nhigh working memory capacity produced long clauses, which were, however, syntactically less \ncomplex indicated that working memory plays a complex role in task performance. We tentatively \nargued that high working memory capacity might allow students to produce narratives with high \nclausal complexity, but it might not be conducive to directing learners\u2019 attention to specific \ndimensions of the task such as subordination. \n \nThe aims of our study \n 12 \nAs the review of literature shows, there is a scarcity of studies that investigate the role of \ncognitive factors in communicative task performance, and no research has been done on the \ndifferential effect of these individual variables on the quality of both written and spoken output. \nTherefore, one of the questions that we addressed in our study concerned how different components \nof language aptitude are related to Hungarian-speaking EFL learners\u2019 performance on oral and \nwritten narrative tasks. We were also interested in how individual differences in language aptitude \nmanifest themselves in tasks which make different conceptualization demands on the learners. For \nthis purpose we used two narrative tasks which differed with regard to whether the students were \nrequired to devise the plot of the story. Language aptitude was assessed using a Hungarian version \nof the MLAT (HUNLAT: Ott\u00f3, 2002) based on the consideration that the constructs operationalized \nin this test battery, especially grammatical sensitivity and deductive learning ability, have been \nfound to be relevant both under explicit and implicit language learning conditions, a mixture of \nwhich characterizes current foreign language learning contexts. \nIn our study we also aimed to discover differences in linguistic performance measures in the \nabove-described task types across modes. Our goal was to gain further insights into differences in \nspoken and written performance of L2 learners by extending the range of variables that are \ntraditionally included in the analysis of task performance. We based our decision of selecting task-\nspecific variables on three sources of information. First of all, we conducted an initial analysis on \nthe tenses of verbs used by the learners, which suggested that a high percentage of the participants \nused the past tense to narrate their stories and that type of subordinate clause used with the highest \nfrequency was the relative clause.1 Second, we administered the same tasks to 10 young native \nspeakers of British English and analyzed their performance for these features. The analyses revealed \nthat 80% of the native speaker participants primarily used past tense for narrating the cartoon \ndescription task in speech, and all the native speakers used past tense for describing events in the \noral story narration task and in both tasks in writing. The relative clause was also the most frequent \ntype of subordinate clause in the output of the native speakers. The selection of past tense verbs and \n 13 \nrelative clauses was also based on theoretical considerations. Although historic present is frequently \nused in narratives by native speakers, studies in the field of discourse analysis suggest that its use is \nrestricted to adding a dramatic emphasis to the story and moving the events out of the past to the \nmoment of speaking (Schiffrin, 1981). Historic present mainly occurs in situations where speakers \nnarrate a personal story and is almost exclusively applied in describing complicating events \n(Schiffrin, 1981). The task used in our study did not involve the narration of personal stories, and \nparticipants rarely added complicating events; consequently, we deemed it appropriate to select past \ntense as the major tense in which the story is expected to be narrated. Nevertheless, our analysis \nfocussed on target-like-use and not on suppliance in obligatory contexts (Pica, 1984), which \nallowed us to consider the use of present as an additional acceptable tense.  \nRelative clauses also have several important discourse and linguistic functions in narratives, \nnamely to name, situate and identify old and new referents in the story, to present main characters, \nto motivate, enable and continue narrative actions, to set up expectations about narrative entities and \nevents and to sum up past or upcoming events (Dasinger & Toupin, 1994). They have been found to \nbe frequent in narratives produced by adult and child L1 speakers (Dasinger & Toupin, 1994). \nRelative clauses have increased importance in learning English as an L2 because they are difficult \nto acquire and use accurately (Pienemann, 1998), and consequently might provide relevant \ninformation on the complexity and  accuracy of L2 performance.  \n Based on the above-described theoretical considerations and on the results of our \npreliminary analyses, the study addressed the following research questions: \n1. How is Hungarian L2 learners\u2019 narrative performance affected by mode and task type? \n2. How do the components of language aptitude relate to general and task-specific measures of \naccuracy, syntactic complexity, lexical variety and fluency when performing two different \ntypes of oral narrative tasks? \n3. How do the components of language aptitude relate to general and task-specific measures of \naccuracy, complexity and lexical variety in two different types of written narrative tasks? \n 14 \n \nMETHOD \nParticipants \nThe present study was conducted in a Hungarian-English bilingual secondary school for students \naged between 15 and 18 in Budapest, Hungary.  The participants (N=44) were students in the \nsecond academic year of a bilingual education program which consists of a so-called zero year and \nfour years of bilingual secondary education. During the zero-year the students took part in an \nintensive English language training program, which aimed to prepare them for studying several \nschool subjects in English in the following four years of secondary school. The teaching method \nused was predominantly communicative. The participants in our study completed the zero-year \nprogram in June 2006 before starting their secondary studies in September 2006. At the time of the \ndata collection for the present research, they had just begun the second academic year of their \nstudies. The participants\u2019 age was between 16 and 17 years. 27 students were female and 17 male. \nThe teachers of the students rated the participants\u2019 level of proficiency as slightly above \nintermediate corresponding to B1\/B2 in the Common European Framework of Reference (Council \nof Europe, 2001), which was also supported by the results of the language proficiency test that they \nadministered to the students at the end of their zero year.  \n \nInstruments \nThe within-participants factors of the study are task type (cartoon description vs. picture narration) \nand mode (oral vs. written) while the components of language aptitude (as measured by the \nHungarian Language Aptitude Test (HUNLAT)) constitute between-participants factors. \nParticipants completed four narrative tasks: two involving cartoon description, and two involving \npicture narration (see Appendix). First they performed a cartoon-description task and a picture \nnarration task orally (in random order). Then, a month later, they performed parallel versions of \nthese tasks in writing (in self-chosen order, due to the limitations of the group administration \n 15 \nprocedures). The cartoon description task involved the description of a comic strip consisting of six \npictures, which had to be included in the story. The pictures were presented in the correct order and \nformed a coherent story line. The input to the task was provided visually, with instructions in \nHungarian. In the oral version of the task the students had to narrate the story of a ship-wrecked \nman, who is not recognized as needing help and who in the end remains stranded on a desert island. \nIn the written version of the task, a car which is broken down in the middle of the desert is \ntransformed into a carriage without a horse by a wizard instead of being repaired. The stories \nincluded the same number of actors and key narrative events and both had an element of surprise. \nThis type of task did not require the conceptualization of the plot, and was consequently considered \nto place a relatively low cognitive load on the participants in terms of conceptualizing their \nmessage, but as argued above, might have made greater demands on the learners in terms of \nlinguistic encoding.  \nThe picture narration required students to tell a story based on six unrelated pictures, all of \nwhich had to be included in the narrative. The pictures were selected carefully to include similar \nelements in the two versions of the task. In both versions of the task there was an object (book vs. \nring), a picture depicting an adverse weather condition (a storm with lightening vs. a storm at sea), a \nmeans of transport (boat vs. airplane), a picture showing a geographical location (mountains vs. an \nisland), a house (in the middle of a forest vs. in a town) and a door (locked vs. open).  In order to \nsuccessfully complete this task, the participants not only had to rely on their language skills, but \nthey also had to use their imagination and find a way to relate the pictures to one another and invent \na story around them. As argued above, this task can be characterized as cognitively more complex \nin terms of conceptualization and might pose smaller processing demands in linguistic encoding \nthan the cartoon description task.  \nIn order to avoid task repetition effects, these parallel versions of the cartoon description and \npicture narration task were administered to the students orally and in writing. The written and oral \ntasks only differed in the picture cues; as explained above, the structure of the task was exactly the \n 16 \nsame. In a previous research project, Albert (2007) validated the two forms of the cartoon \ndescription and picture narration task orally and found no significant differences in any of the \nlinguistic variables in the two versions of the tasks when performed in speaking.2 We assumed that \ndue to the fact that the two tasks were found to be parallel in a similar population when performed \nin speech, any differences between the cartoon-description versus picture-narration tasks when \nadministered in writing could be attributed to the effect of mode. \nAs already mentioned, the participants\u2019 foreign language aptitude was measured using the \nHUNLAT (Ott\u00f3, 2002) which consists of four subtests described below (Table 1 contains the \ndescriptive statistics of the HUNLAT scores for the participants in the study).  The HUNLAT is a \ntest battery for the Carollian concept of language aptitude (1981), which measures four constructs: \nphonological sensitivity, deductive language learning ability, grammatical sensitivity, and rote-\nlearning ability (for information on the validity of the test see Nikolov & Ott\u00f3, 2003; Hild, 2007).  \nInsert Table 1 around here \n \n1. Phonological sensitivity  \nThis test is a modified version of the \u2018Phonetic script\u2019 task of the MLAT and intends to \nmeasure phonetic coding ability. Participants listen to 54 consonant-vowel-consonant sequences \nand follow the transcription of these sequences in the test booklet. Afterwards they hear 20 similar \nsound sequences, and they have to indicate on the answer sheet which one of four possible \ntranscriptions corresponds to the given sound sequence. There is also a \u2018none\u2019 option. This subtest \ntakes about 10 minutes. \n2. Deductive ability  \nThis subtest, which was adapted from Pimsleur\u2019s (1966) Language Aptitude Battery, aims to \nmeasure deductive language learning ability. Participants are given a set of words and sentences in \nan artificial language along with their Hungarian translations. On the basis of this information, they \n 17 \nhave to translate 20 Hungarian sentences to the artificial language and choose the correct solution \nfrom four alternatives. Participants have 15 minutes for this subtest.  \n3. Grammatical sensitivity  \nThis task is based on a similar subtest of the MLAT and is assumed to measure grammatical \nsensitivity. Participants have 10 minutes to solve 20 items, each consisting of two Hungarian \nsentences. One word is underlined in the first sentence. In the second sentence, five words are \nunderlined, and participants have to choose the one that fulfils the same function as the underlined \nword in the first sentence.  \n4. Rote learning ability \nThis subtest, which was adapted from the relevant section of MLAT (Paired Associates), \nmeasures rote learning ability. Participants have 5 minutes to study a list of 24 Swahili words and \ntheir Hungarian equivalents. Then they have 10 minutes to choose the Hungarian equivalent of 20 \nSwahili words from five alternatives. \n \nProcedure \n \nThe aptitude test was completed by the students at the beginning of the academic year. The \noral narrative tasks were administered to the students individually in a quiet room at school in the \nthird week of the school year. They were given two minutes to prepare for each task. The planning \ntime was selected based on the piloting of the tasks with 5 students at a similar proficiency level. In \nthe pilot study students were given longer planning time (5 minutes), but they usually started their \nstories after three minutes of planning. The order in which the students performed the oral tasks was \nrandomized. The students\u2019 performance was recorded on a digital recorder, and the recordings were \nsubsequently transcribed for analysis by a trained research assistant. After a one month interval, the \nparticipants completed two written narrative tasks one after the other during a regular English \nclass.3 They had 30 minutes to do the two tasks, but most of them finished earlier. They were \n 18 \ninstructed to write a minimum of 150 words for each task. The students could decide on the order in \nwhich they completed the tasks. Approximately 55% of the students started with the cartoon \ndescription task, and 45% of the students chose to write the story narration task first. \n \nAnalysis \nThe following general measures of linguistic performance were used. In order to assess \nlexical diversity, we applied Malvern and Richards' (1997) D-formula. The calculation of the D-\nvalue is based on a mathematical probabilistic model as operationalized in the VOCD software of \nthe CHILDES database (http:\/\/childes.psy.cmu.edu), which uses random sampling of tokens in \ncalculating the type-token ratio. Malvern and Richards (1997) argue that the D-value is a valid \nmeasure of lexical diversity because it does not depend on the length of the sample, and it uses all \nthe words produced by the participants (for a discussion of various measures of lexical diversity see \nJarvis, 2002).  \nAccuracy of general task performance was measured with the ratio of error-free clauses, \nwhich was calculated relative to the total number of clauses. Syntactic complexity was \noperationalized as the ratio of subordinate clauses, which was also expressed relative to the total \nnumber of clauses, and as the length of clauses, which was calculated as the number of words \nwithin a clause (Norris & Ortega, 2009). The measure of fluency was speech rate, which has been \nshown to be a reliable measure of fluency (Kormos & D\u00e9nes, 2004). Speech rate was calculated as \nthe total number of syllables uttered by each student divided by the total amount of time spent \nspeaking (including pause and hesitation time). These accuracy, complexity and fluency measures \nhave been widely used in task-based research and have proven to reflect the characteristics of \naccuracy and grammatical complexity of students' output in a reliable manner (see Bygate, 1999; \nRobinson, 1995; Foster & Skehan, 1996; Skehan & Foster, 1997).  \nThe selection of task-specific measures of performance was based on theoretical \nconsiderations and on the initial analysis of data as described above. Task-specific measures of \n 19 \naccuracy included the ratio of error-free relative clauses, which was calculated in proportion to the \ntotal number of relative clauses, as well as the ratio of error-free verbs and the ratio of error-free \npast-tense verbs. The ratio of error-free verbs was obtained by dividing the number of correctly \nused verb forms by the total number of verbs. The ratio of error-free past-tense verbs was expressed \nas the ratio of error-free past-tense verbs to the total number of past-tense verbs used. This analysis \nwas a target-like use analysis (Pica, 1984), which focused on contexts where the structure was \nactually used by the learner and which involved making a decision on whether the structure was \naccurately used. The choice of this method of analysis was based on the fact that historic present \nand past might both be used in certain contexts, which does not allow for a reliable analysis of this \nstructure using the method of obligatory occasion analysis. A task-specific measure of syntactic \ncomplexity was also chosen: the ratio of relative clauses, which was calculated by dividing the \nnumber of relative clauses by the total number of clauses. This measure has been used as an index in \nsyntactic development in the production of narratives in L1 child language acquisition research \n(Dasinger & Toupin, 1994). Table 2 summarizes the performance measures used in this study. The \ntwo authors coded the accuracy measures separately and the average percentage of agreement was \n97%. \nFor the statistical analysis SPSS 13.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) was used. The \nstatistical analyses performed were correlations and paired samples t-tests.4 In order to compensate \nfor multiple testing, the level of significance for this study was set at \u03b1 = 0.01. Cohen\u2019s d value was \nused to measure effect sizes. D values below .5 indicate small, between .5 and .8 medium, and \nabove .8 large effect size (Cohen, 1988). \n \nInsert Table 2 around here \n \n \n \n 20 \nRESULTS \n \nTable 3 shows the descriptive statistics of the means and standard deviations of the measures of \nlexical variety, complexity, accuracy and fluency. Here we will report only on the significant \ndifferences between measures of performance. The comparison of tasks in the two different modes \nof performance reveals that students used more varied vocabulary in the written mode both in the \ncartoon description (t(43) = 6.96, p < .001 d = .72) and in the picture narration task (t(43) = 9.18, p \n< .001 d =.81). The participants also produced a significantly higher proportion of error-free clauses \n(t(43) = 3.27 p = .002 Cohen\u2019s d = .44) and verbs (t(43) = 5.08  p = .001 d =.61) in the written \ncartoon description task than in the parallel oral task. In the oral mode of performance, participants \nused significantly more varied vocabulary in the cartoon description task than in the picture \nnarration task (t(43) = 3.46, p < .001 d = .44). On the other hand, the ratio of error-free verbs was \nsignificantly lower in the oral cartoon description task than in the picture narration task (t(43) = \n3.46, p < .001 d = .44). In the written mode, students produced significantly shorter clauses (t(43) = \n2.75, p = .001 d = .38) and used more relative clauses (t(43) = 2.72, p = .001 d = .38) in the picture \nnarration task than in the cartoon description task.  \n \nInsert Table 3 around here \nTables 4a and 4b display how aptitude scores as measured by HUNLAT are related to task \nperformance in the oral mode. In the oral cartoon description task the ratio of error-free relative \nclauses correlated positively with grammatical sensitivity and the overall HUNLAT score, whereas \nin the picture narration task students with higher levels of grammatical sensitivity used relative \nclauses less correctly. 5  In the oral picture narration task, deductive ability was negatively related to \nD-value. Tables 5a and 5b show the results of correlations in the written mode. As shown in Table \n5a, students who scored high on the grammatical sensitivity sub-test produced longer clauses in the \nwritten cartoon description task. In the case of the written picture narration task, however, no \n 21 \nsignificant relationships emerged (see Table 5b). All the significant correlations between \nperformance measures and aptitude components were moderately strong. \nInsert Tables 4a, 4b, 5a, 5b around here \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nDifferences between modes of performance \n \nThe results indicate that in writing students were more accurate and used more varied vocabulary. \nOur findings are partially similar to that of Granfeldt (2008), who also concluded that mode \ninfluenced the lexical variety of output; however, they contradict the results of his study, as well as \nthat of Kuiken and Vedder (2009), by showing a significant increase in accuracy in writing in one \nof our tasks: the cartoon description task. The comparison of studies on this topic is very difficult \ndue to the nature of different tasks used and to the differing level of participants\u2019 proficiency. Some \nparallels between Kuiken and Vedder\u2019s (2009) and our research might, however, be drawn if we \nexamine the tasks used in the two studies. Kuiken and Vedder (2009) administered a task in which \nstudents had to justify their choices for a particular holiday destination. This task is similar to the \nstory narration task used in our study, in that it is also high in conceptualization demands. \nTherefore, it might be possible that in tasks which require increased attention in terms of \nconceptualization, L2 learners do not seem to produce more accurate language in writing than in \nspeech because their attentional resources are devoted to content planning rather than to encoding \nand monitoring linguistic form.   The cyclical nature of writing, which theoretically would allow for \na closer monitoring of accuracy than the on-line characteristics of speaking, might only increase \naccuracy in tasks such as our cartoon description task, which does not involve high conceptualizing \ndemands and requires the linguistic encoding of specified content.  \n 22 \nThe findings concerning the higher variety of words in writing than in speech can be \nexplained with reference to the availability of on-line planning time in writing, which might have \nallowed learners to avoid repeating the same words and helped them retrieve more varied \nvocabulary from their mental lexicon. An alternative explanation might be that when teaching L2 \nwriting, teachers generally encourage higher lexical variety, and students might have been aware of \nthis encouragement.  \nOur results concerning the lack of difference in syntactic complexity between writing and \nspeech are similar to those of Granfeldt (2008), but are contradictory to those of Kuiken and Vedder \n(2009). The lack of effect of mode on syntactic complexity might be explained with reference to the \nresource-directing aspects of task complexity. As the two tasks were assumed to be parallel in \nwriting and in speech, they might have directed learners\u2019 attention to similar syntactic features and \nconsequently might have elicited similar levels of syntactic complexity.  \n \nDifferences between task types \n \nAs regards the effect of task type in the different modes, the results indicate that the picture \nnarration task in writing elicited syntactically more complex language, as assessed by clause length \nand the ratio of relative clauses, than the cartoon description task. This finding is seemingly in \ncontrast with that of Kuiken and Vedder (2008), who found no effect of task complexity in the \nwritten mode. Kuiken and Vedder (2008), however, used only a subordination ratio as the measure \nof syntactic complexity.  Based on our results concerning syntactic complexity in different types of \ntasks in the two modes of performance, we can hypothesize that in writing, where the resource-\ndispersing dimension of task complexity might play a different role, the picture narration task, \nwhich requires students to conceptualize their own stories, has the potential to direct students\u2019 \nattention to syntactic complexity. In the oral version of this task, however, the demand that students \nneed to conceptualize and linguistically encode their narrative at the same time acts as a resource-\n 23 \ndispersion factor, and students do not seem to have sufficient attentional resources for producing \nsyntactically complex language.  \nTask type was also found to have an effect on one specific aspect of accuracy and on lexical \nvariety in the oral mode. On the one hand, the cartoon description task seems to have pushed \nstudents to use more varied vocabulary in order to be able to express the predetermined storyline \ndepicted in the cartoon. At the same time students\u2019 accuracy in verb forms decreased in this task, \nwhich might seem to indicate a trade-off effect between lexical and grammatical encoding in the \nlinguistic formulation phase of speech production. On the other hand, in the picture narration task, \nthe students could conceptualize the story line taking their own linguistic resources into account and \nmight have used vocabulary which was easily accessible from their mental lexicon. As a \nconsequence, they might have had more attention available for the accurate linguistic encoding of \nverbs. The lack of significant differences in fluency between the two tasks also seems to lend \nsupport to this trade-off effect and might suggest that the overall processing load at the linguistic \nencoding stage of the tasks might have been similar. If our reasoning about conceptualization and \nlinguistic encoding demands is on the right track, these findings indicate that it is also important to \nconsider the cognitive aspects of task complexity in the linguistic encoding phase and not only at \nthe conceptualization stage of speech production. Table 6 gives an overview of the psycholinguistic \ncharacteristics of the two tasks and summarizes the main findings in terms of lexical variety, \naccuracy and complexity. \nThe results might also indicate that task type effects manifest themselves differently in \nspeech than in writing. In speech not only do learners need to divide their attention between \nconceptualization and linguistic encoding, but they also need to carry out linguistic encoding \nprocesses under time-pressure, which requires that they share attentional resources during lexical \nand syntactic encoding (see Table 6). As argued above, in the oral version of the cartoon description \ntask students\u2019 attention might have been drawn to lexical encoding, and hence, they might have had \nless attention available for syntactic encoding. In writing, however, syntactic and lexical encoding \n 24 \ndo not need to be carried out in parallel, which might result in improved accuracy in general and in \nthe use of verb forms in particular in the written cartoon description task.  This suggests that there \nmight be an interaction between task type and mode, as tasks with different cognitive and linguistic \ndemands seem to elicit different patterns of performance in writing than in speech. As a \nconsequence, it might be difficult to draw general conclusions concerning the effect of mode on \ntask performance without taking the characteristics of the task to be performed into consideration. \n \nInsert Table 6 around here \n \nThe relationship between aptitude and oral task performance \n \nOur findings indicate that students with a given cognitive profile do not perform consistently in \nnarrative tasks. In the oral cartoon description task, where students were not required to \nconceptualize and linguistically encode their message at the same time, high grammatical sensitivity \nand high level of language learning aptitude might have helped students to successfully encode \ncomplex and difficult syntactic structures such as relative clauses. In the oral picture narration task, \nhowever, where the HUNLAT correlations with lexical diversity and the accuracy of relative \nclauses was negative, the task demands in terms of conceptualizing the content of the story might \nhave caused difficulties to students with high grammatical sensitivity in employing their linguistic \nknowledge efficiently. We might argue that grammatical sensitivity is a cognitive ability that aids \nthe conscious and explicit acquisition of complex syntactic knowledge (Robinson, 2005b) and that \nthis ability might also help learners with high aptitude to consciously employ their explicit \nknowledge when they have sufficient attentional capacities that they can devote to linguistic \nencoding. This might be the case in the oral cartoon description task, in which students did not have \nto conceptualize the content of the narrative, and hence learners with high grammatical sensitivity \nmight have been able to apply their explicit knowledge of relative clauses efficiently.  \n 25 \nFrom the perspective of students who scored low on the grammatical sensitivity component \nof HUNLAT, the findings indicate that they might be less able to encode complex syntactic \nstructures accurately in oral tasks in which the given content requires the use of specific syntactic \nstructures and are thus high in linguistic encoding demands. They might, however, be advantaged in \nthe oral picture narration task, in which they have the opportunity to avoid complex structures and \nin which attentional demands on conceptualization are high. A possible explanation for this might \nbe that learners with lower levels of grammatical sensitivity might rely more on implicit knowledge \nand memorized chunks and thus might be more efficient in employing implicit knowledge of \ncomplex syntactic structures than students with high grammatical sensitivity.  \nIt is interesting to note the negative relationship in the oral picture narration task between \ndeductive ability and lexical variety as measured by the D-value. We might tentatively argue that \nlearners with high deductive ability might have devoted their attentional resources to some other \naspects of performance in this task. Niwa\u2019s research (2000) also found that in the cognitively more \ncomplex task students with high aptitude scores performed worse in fluency, which she explained \nwith reference to the fact that they might have paid more attention to the linguistic and conceptual \nencoding required by the task. Although the correlation between deductive ability and ratio of error-\nfree clauses (r = .27 p =.07) is not significant, its direction is positive. Despite being weak, this \ncorrelation might indicate that students with high level of deductive abilities prioritized accuracy \nover lexical variety.  \nFinally, we would like to point out a tendency-level correlation between the ratio of error-\nfree past-tense verbs and rote learning ability in the oral cartoon description task (r =.38, p = .02). \nRote learning ability helps in memorizing words and irregular morphological information. A great \nproportion of past-tense verb forms at the low-frequency level of vocabulary our participants tended \nto employ are irregular, and consequently rote-learning ability helps their accurate acquisition. The \nresults indicate that students with high score in rote learning ability tended to be able to accurately \n 26 \nretrieve the past-tense verb forms in the oral cartoon description task, in which they had sufficient \nattention available for linguistic encoding.  \n \nThe relationship between aptitude and written task performance \n \nSimilarly to the oral mode, grammatical sensitivity was found to be positively related to certain \naspects of performance in the written cartoon description task, but in writing the negative \nrelationship of aptitude components and accuracy and lexical diversity was not observed in the \npicture narration task. The finding that learners with high grammatical sensitivity produced longer \nclauses in the written cartoon description task might be related to the complexity demands of this \nwriting task. This task relieved students from the cognitive load of having to conceptualize the story \nbut made high demands on the participants in the linguistic encoding phase because they had to \nexpress a given content with their existing resources. The comparison of the mean values for clause-\nlength in the two types of narratives also shows that students in general used shorter clauses in the \npicture narration task than in the story narration. Considering the linguistic encoding demands of \nthe task, it seems that students with higher grammatical sensitivity might have devoted more \nattention to clausal complexity than learners with lower levels of cognitive ability who might have \nprioritized other aspects of linguistic processing such as the encoding of sub-ordinate clauses. This \nseems to be supported by the finding that grammatical sensitivity was negatively, although not \nsignificantly, correlated with the other two syntactic complexity measures including the ratio of \nsubordinate and relative clauses. This pattern of correlations might suggest that in the cartoon \ndescription task students with high grammatical sensitivity tended to produce longer clauses at the \nexpense of greater subordination complexity, whereas students with lower levels of grammatical \nsensitivity used more sub-ordinate and relative clauses, but produced shorter clauses.   \nWe also need to account for the fact, however, that in the written picture narration task no \nrelationship between aptitude and any of the performance measures was found. It was already \n 27 \nshown in the case of the oral version of this task that students with better cognitive abilities tended \nto perform worse in terms of the accuracy of relative clauses and D-value than participants with low \naptitude scores. We explained this finding by arguing that the fact that the learners had to divide \ntheir attention between conceptualization and linguistic encoding in the oral picture narration task \nmight have disadvantaged learners with high levels of grammatical sensitivity and deductive ability. \nDue to the availability of extensive on-line planning time and the cyclical nature of writing, sharing \nattentional resources between conceptualization and linguistic encoding in the writing phase might \nbe  less demanding than in speech, and therefore this task condition might not create a disadvantage \nfor learners with high level of cognitive abilities. \n  \nImplications and limitations \n \nIn our research we investigated the relationship of traditional components of aptitude with the \naccuracy, fluency, syntactic complexity and lexical variety of performance in two types of narrative \ntasks, which were administered both orally and in writing to 44 upper-intermediate Hungarian \nlearners of English. Our study also aimed to reveal how narrative performance varies in tasks of \ndifferent cognitive complexity in the written and spoken modes. Our findings indicate that in \nwriting the participants were more accurate and used more varied vocabulary than in speech, but \ntheir performance was similar in terms of syntactic complexity. The effect of task type on \nperformance differed in the two modes. In speech students used fewer correct verb forms and more \nvaried vocabulary in the cartoon description task than in the picture narration task. In writing, \nhowever, the picture narration task elicited syntactically more complex language than the cartoon \ndescription task. The results seem to lend support to Robinson\u2019s (2001b, 2003, 2005b) Cognition \nHypothesis because in writing, where the resource-dispersing demands of tasks are reduced, the \ntask that required complex cognitive planning at the level of conceptualization had the potential to \ndirect learners\u2019 attention to syntactically more complex language.  We also pointed out, however, \n 28 \nthat it might be difficult to rank order pedagogic tasks in terms of cognitive complexity, and that \ncognitive demands of tasks should not only be considered at the conceptualization phase of speech \nproduction but also at the level of linguistic encoding.  \nOur results indicate that aptitude components were differently related to linguistic measures \nof oral performance than to those of written production, and that the strongest positive link between \naptitude and linguistic measures manifested itself in the cartoon description task, where students did \nnot have to conceptualize the storyline. The results of this study might provide support for \nRobinson\u2019s (2001a, 2005a) Aptitude Complexes Hypothesis as they reveal that aptitude \ncomponents play various roles in influencing performance under different task conditions. From our \nresults we can see that aptitude is not a unitary construct, and having high levels of cognitive ability \ndoes not necessarily result in enhanced quality of task performance. This suggests that varying \ninstructional tasks in classroom settings as well as tasks used in language assessment is essential in \norder to give learners with different cognitive profiles equal chances to perform to the best of their \npotential. \nOur findings also highlight the importance of examining task-specific measures of linguistic \nperformance because most of the significant aptitude and task effects were found on variables \nwhich have not been used in task-based research before. Accuracy rates in selected syntactic \nstructures across different types of tasks can be indicative not only of the state of language \ndevelopment but also of how different types of tasks succeed in eliciting accurate language use. \n It has to be acknowledged that our study has a number of limitations. One short-coming of \nour research is that tasks were not counter-balanced in the different modalities. This might have \ninduced an effect of the content of the task in the different modes of performance. An additional \nconcern might be that the task-specific measures of performance targeted structures the occurrence \nof which was limited in number, and consequently a larger corpus of L2 data would be needed to \nverify our findings concerning the link between aptitude and the accurate use of relative clauses. \nThe results of our study should also be interpreted with caution due to the characteristics of the \n 29 \nparticipants. The students who participated in our research had generally high scores in language \naptitude and were enrolled in a highly intensive language training programme. These circumstances \nnecessarily warrant replication with students who show more variation in their cognitive profiles \nand who have different levels of proficiency. As aptitude has been found to have differential \ninfluences across different instructional settings, further studies should also be conducted to \nexamine the interaction of cognitive factors and language teaching methodology. Finally, we also \nhave to note that our findings reveal that even relatively similar tasks which share the same genre \nmight elicit remarkably different performance. Therefore, it is highly important to consider the \npsycholinguistic characteristics of spoken and written tasks at different stages of language \nproduction if we want to advance our knowledge of how tasks can elicit targeted aspects of \nlanguage. \n 30 \nAUTHOR NOTE \n \nJudit Kormos, Lancaster University, Department of Linguistics  \nAnna Trebits, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest, Hungary, Department of English Applied \nLinguistics \n \nAcknowledgements: \nWe are very grateful for the three anonymous reviewers for their thorough comments on previous \nversions of this manuscript.

The proportion of past-tense verbs relative to the total number of finite verbs was 71% in the \noral cartoon description task, 87% in the oral picture narration task, 95% in the written \ncartoon description task and 98% in the written picture narration task. 88% of students used \nat least one relative clause in the oral cartoon description task, 95% in the oral picture \nnarration task, 80% in the written cartoon description task and 85% in the written picture \nnarration task. \n2. Albert (2007) administered all four tasks in speech to a group of participants, who were of \ncomparable level of proficiency. She analyzed the parallel versions of the tasks in terms of \ndiscourse complexity (the number and type of narrative events) and linguistic variables \n(speech rate (as measured by syllables per second), accuracy (ratio of error-free clauses), \nsyntactic complexity (subordination ratio) and lexical variety (D-value)). Neither the \nqualitative nor the quantitative analyses revealed any significant differences between the \ndiscourse structure and the linguistic features of performance in the two versions of the \npicture narration and cartoon description task. \n3. The one month interval between the oral and written task was due to organizational reasons \n(we did not want to disrupt the teaching routine with a brief interval). The students received \napproximately 16 hours of classroom instruction between the two data collection sessions, \nwhich is not expected to result in substantial linguistic development during this period. \n4. The aptitude sub-tests were not significantly correlated with each other, which allowed us to \nexamine the effect of the components of the test on task performance independently of each \nother. \n5. The correlation between the total aptitude score and the ratio of error-free clauses is an \nartefact of the high correlation of grammatical sensitivity and the ratio of error-free clauses \nbecause the grammatical sensitivity score contributes significantly to the total aptitude score \n(r = .59 p <.0001). \n 32 \n \nReferences \nAbrahamsson, N., & Hyltenstam, K.
