This study reviews\nthe existing econometric evidence on the effects of water privatisation in developing\neconomies before presenting new results using statistical, data envelopment analysis\n(DEA) and stochastic cost frontier techniques and data from Africa.

Introduction1\nAccess to water is crucial to life and health and the provision of safe and affordable\nwater services remains a priority for most developing economies. According to the World\nBank (2003, p.1) more than 1bn people in the developing world lack access to clean water\nand nearly 1 .2bn lack adequate sanitation. It is estimated that 1 2.2m people die every\nyear from diseases directly related to drinking contaminated water. The inclusion of a\nwater access target in the Millenium Development Goals \u2013 to halve the proportion of people\nwithout access to safe drinking water by 2015 \u2013 is a recognition of the importance of safe\nwater supply in reducing poverty in the developing world (Calderon and Serven, 2004).\nOne of the major causes of poor access to water services is the inefficiencies of the water\nutilities which mainly serve the urban areas. The water utilities are predominantly in\npublic ownership, and in many systems as much as a third of production is lost, revenues are\ninsufficient to cover operating costs and the quality of the water is poor (World Bank,\n2004a, p.220). Faced with the deterioration in water sector performance, donor agencies\nhave advocated the privatisation of public utilities in lower-income economies to promote\nmore efficient operation, increase investment and service coverage, and to reduce the\nfinancial burden on government budgets (World Bank, 1995). In response, a range of\nservices including water supply have been opened up to private capital (World Bank,\n2003; Harris, 2003). Private participation in water, however, has been less common than in\nother infrastructure sectors, and the pace of reform has been slower and harder to\n4sustain politically (World Bank, 2004: p220). Although privatisation appears to have the\npotential to improve water services and meet the needs of the poor, it may be difficult to\nachieve. The possible reasons relate to the technology of water provision (high fixed\ncosts and location specificity), which severely restrict the prospects for competition, the\ntransaction costs of organising long-term concession agreements and regulatory\nweaknesses. There is also the difficulty of balancing adequate returns to investors and\nensuring that water services remain affordable to the poor.\nThe pressing challenge for public policy towards the water sector is to meet both\nefficiency and social welfare objectives, and to determine the extent to which privatisation\nis critical to achieving the Millenium Development Goal for safe, accessible and affordable\nwater services. This paper explores these issues by examining the impact of water services\nprivatisation in Africa. It begins with a review of the existing econometric evidence on the\nimpact of water privatisation. We then provide results using a data set for African water\nutilities using statistical, DEA and stochastic cost frontier measures to triangulate the\nevidence and to assess consistency across the results.2 Data availability restricted the\nnumber of dimensions of performance that we were able to estimate, however, the results\nfor cost efficiency and service quality fail to show that performance of privatised water\nutilities is superior to that of state-run firms. The paper goes on to consider the difficulties\nthat face privatisation and regulation in water services, in terms of the technology of water\nprovision and the nature of the product, transaction costs and regulatory weaknesses. That\ndata deficiency may explain our failure to identify better performance under private\noperation is recognised.\n52. The Existing Evidence\nPrivate water suppliers exist in all developing countries in the form of water vendors at\nthe street level, but there was little privatisation of piped water services in developing\ncountries before 1990 (Snell, 1998; Collignon and V\u00e9zina, 2000). Where privatised\nservices existed, for example in Cote d\u2019Ivoire, these were usually French speaking ex-\ncolonies that had inherited a reliance on private firms for water services, as exists in\nFrance. Between 1984 and 1990 only eight contracts for water and sewerage projects\nwere awarded to the private sector world-wide and the cumulative new capital\nexpenditure in private water services totalled less than US$ 1bn.\nHowever, during the 1990s there was a significant increase in water privatisation activity,\nstimulated by donor agency pressures, and in 1997 the total figure for private investment\nhad risen to US$25bn (World Bank, 2003). By the end of 2000 at least 93 countries had\nprivatised some of their piped water services, including Argentina, Chile, China,\nColombia, the Philippines, South Africa and the transition economies of Central Europe,\nas well as Australia and the UK (Brubaker, 2001). Based on the World Bank public-\nprivate investment (PPI) data base and taking the period from 1990 to 2002, there were 106\nsuch projects in Latin America and the Caribbean and 73 in East Asia and the Pacific\nregion. By contrast there were only seven projects in the Middle East and North Africa\nand 14 in sub-Saharan Africa. In terms of the amounts invested, Latin America\n6and the Caribbean and East Asia and the Pacific accounted together for over 95 per cent of\nthe total investment. Table 1 provides a summary of the largest investments in water\nservices during the period 1990 to 2002. Clearly, a small number of countries accounted\nfor most of the privatisation of water services, and within these countries the figures were\ndominated by a few large contracts. Indeed, one project, Aguas Argentinas, accounted for\nUS$4.9bn or 20 per cent of the investment in the whole of Latin America; while five\nPhilippines contracts accounted for 38.4 per cent of the total private investment in water\nservices in East Asia.\n(Table 1 here.)\nPast studies of privatisation have indicated that competition is generally more important\nthan ownership, per se, in explaining performance improvements in developing countries\n(e.g. Zhang et al., 2003; Parker and Kirkpatrick, 2005). But unlike in the case of\ntelecommunications and parts of energy supply, such as generation, where competition is\nfeasible, competition in the market for water services is usually cost inefficient. While\nthere is scope for introducing some competition into billing and metering and into\nconstruction, replacement and repair work within water services, competition in the actual\nprovision of water supplies is normally ruled out by the scale of the investment in network\nassets that are needed to deliver the product. Moreover, even where actual competition\nfor consumers might seem feasible, for example where the boundaries of different water\nutilities meet, the costs of moving water down pipes is far higher than the costs of\ntransmitting telephone calls and distributing electricity, and this places a serious\n7limitation on the development of competition. Also, mixing water from different sources\ncan raise complications in terms of maintaining water quality, which can be an important\nconsideration for domestic consumers but more especially water-using industries, such as\nbrewing and food processing. In other words, the technology of water supply and the\nnature of the product, together, severely restrict the prospects for competition in the\nmarket and therefore the efficiency gains that can result from encouraging competition\nfollowing privatisation. This leaves rivalry under privatisation mainly taking the form of\n\u2018competition for the market\u2019 or competition to win the contract or concession agreement.\nEvidence suggests that privatisation in non-competitive markets produces ambiguous\nresults in terms of improving economic performance (Megginson and Netter, 2001) and\nemphasises the need for effective regulation of the privatised utilities. It is to be expected,\nhowever, that the institutional requirements to ensure that privatised monopolies perform\nwell, notably an effective system of state regulation and supporting governance structures,\nwill be particularly missing in many developing countries (Parker and Kirkpatrick, 2005).\nThis represents a further difficulty in achieving significant performance improvement in\nthe short term, by means of water privatisation.\nPrivatising water services is normally associated with contracts that take the following\nforms, namely, service contracts (contracts to provide specialist services such as billing),\nmanagement contracts and leases for existing facilities (private companies operating\nexisting facilities but without new private sector investment), concessions (requiring the\nprivate sector to invest in facilities), divestitures (sale by the state of some or all of the\n8equity in SOEs) and greenfield investments (including build-operate-transfer [BOT] type\nschemes) (Johnstone and Wood, 2001, pp.10-1 1; World Bank, 2004a, p228). In practice,\ncontracts under which private firms provide the services but government remains the\nultimate owner of the water system and may remain responsible for some investment are\ncommonplace (OECD, 2003). Of 233 water and sewerage contracts with the private sector\narranged between 1990 and 2002 on the World Bank\u2019s PPI Project Database, 40 per cent\ninvolved concession contracts and these accounted for 64 per cent of the total amount\ninvested. Where greenfield projects have occurred, for instance in China, they have often\ninvolved the building and operation of new water treatment plants and BOT schemes for\nwater supplies have been common in Latin America and the Caribbean. Divestitures or the\nsale of state-owned water businesses to the private sector have been rare, accounting for\nonly 15.6 per cent of all water projects and 8 per cent of the total funds invested. Also,\nalthough privatisation of water services has occurred, it is important not to exaggerate its\nimportance. At present, little more than 5 per cent of the world\u2019s population is provided\nwith drinking water through private operators (OECD, 2003) and since the Asian\neconomic crisis of 1997\/98 there has been a marked slow down in infrastructure\nprivatisation in lower-income economies, including in the water sector (Harris, 2003).\nMoreover, the main forms that water privatisation take raise issues about the transfer of\nrisk from the public to the private sector. We return to this subject later in the paper in a\ndiscussion of transaction costs in water service contracting.\nThe existing case study evidence on the results of water privatisation presents a mixed\npicture, with some improvements in labour productivity and operating costs and in the\n9reliability and quality of services and the percentage of the population served (e.g.\nCrampes and Estache, 1996; Estache, et al., 2001; Galiani et al., 2002; Shirley and\nMenard, 2002; World Bank, 2004a, pp.252-257). Balanced against this there is some\nevidence of higher water charges and resulting bouts of public opposition leading to\ncancelled schemes. The evidence is reviewed in Kirkpatrick and Parker (2005), also\nShirley (ed) 2002. Turning to the few published papers that have attempted a statistical or\neconometric analysis of the effects of water privatisation in lower-income economies,\nthese too present little evidence that privatisation has resulted in a marked improvement in\nperformance. Estache and Rossi (2002) compared private and public water companies in\nthe Asian and Pacific region, using 1995 survey data from the Asia Development Bank.\nAdopting stochastic cost frontier modelling and applying error components and technical\nefficiency effects models, they concluded that efficiency was not significantly different in\nthe private and state water sectors. Fifty water enterprises were included in their study\nfrom 29 Asian and Pacific-region countries, with 22 having some form of private sector\nparticipation.\nA further study, this time by Estache and Kouassi (2002), used a sample of 21 African\nwater utilities for the period 1995\/97. They estimated a production function from an\nunbalanced panel data set and used Tobit modelling to relate resulting inefficiency scores to\ngovernance and ownership variables. The study found that private ownership was\nassociated with a lower inefficiency score. However, only three firms in their sample had\nany private capital and levels of corruption and governance were far more important in\nexplaining efficiency differences between firms than the ownership variable.\n10\nFinally, a study of water supply in Africa in the mid to late 1990s by Clarke and Wallsten\n(2002) reported greater service coverage under private ownership. On average, they found\nthat supplies for lower-income households (proxied by educational attainment) were\nsmaller where there was a state-sector operator. Clarke and Wallsten, therefore, concluded\nthat private participation in water schemes leads to more supplies to poorer households\nthan where there is a reliance on state-owned suppliers. Their study suggests that\nprivatisation can improve service provision. However, there may be offsetting service\ndifficulties and especially higher charges when supplies are privatised. In other words,\ndrawing strong conclusions on the desirability of water privatisation based on one measure,\nsuch as service coverage, may mislead. In the analysis below we use a range of performance\nmeasures in an attempt to address this problem.\n3. Assessing Performance in Privatised African Water Utilities\nTo advance understanding of the results of privatisation in water services, we accessed\ndata from the Water Utility Partnership\u2019s SPBNET Africa web site\n(http:\/\/www.wupafrica.org\/spbnet\/angl\/index.html). The SPBNET data base includes up to\n110 water utilities in Africa and was developed with financial and technical support from\nthe Department of International Development (DFID) in London. The data collected,\nusually by questionnaire survey, relate mainly to the year 2000.3 The data set used for\nthis study has 13 countries including 14 utilities that reported private sector\ninvolvement.4 However, not all of these firms could be included in each stage of the\n11\nanalysis because of incomplete data entries. Suppliers are categorised as either state\nowned or privately owned, with the latter capturing the various institutional options for\nprivate sector involvement in the water sector, including management and leasing\ncontracts. Ideally we would use information on the forms that private-sector involvement\ntakes to judge the degree of privatisation, but unfortunately the data source only permitted\nownership to be modelled as a binary variable. This is a limitation of our study, but a\nlimitation shared with the earlier econometric studies referred to above. More generally, the\ndata set is characterised by heterogeneity, small sample size and small number of\nprivatised firms. The data limitations mean that the results must be treated as tentative.\nConclusions on the impact of water privatisation may be sensitive to the precise\nperformance measure used. Therefore, to assess the impact of private capital on\nperformance in water services, a range of performance measures was calculated. Firstly, a\nnumber of statistical measures were computed from the data set, including:\n\u2022 Labour productivity \u2013 labour costs to total costs, number of staff to number of water\nconnections and staff per million cubic metres of water distributed \u2013 all of these\nmeasures will reflect eficiency in the use of labour.\n\uf0b7 The proportion of operating costs spent on fuel and chemicals \u2013 to reflect\neconomies in non-labour operating costs.\n\uf0b7 The percentage of capital utilised \u2013 to reflect capital stock eficiency.\n\uf0b7 Average tariffs \u2013 to reflect the costs of services to consumers.\n12\n\u2022 The percentage of the population served, unaccounted for water (water losses), and\nhours of availability of piped water per day \u2013 to reflect the quality of service\nto consumers.\nAverage figures were computed for both state-owned and privately-owned water\nsuppliers and the results are provided in Table 2, with standard deviations shown in\nparentheses. This stage of the analysis involved between 61 and 84 utilities depending\nupon the performance measure.\n(Table 2 here.)\nThe figures in Table 2 show that, on average, private sector water utilities have higher\nlabour productivity (both a lower number of staff to number of connections and per\nmillion cubic metres of water distributed) and a lower proportional spend on labour in\noperating costs than state-owned firms. On average, the private sector is also more\neconomic in its use of other inputs, namely fuel and chemicals, and achieves a slightly\nhigher capital utilisation, of 67 per cent as against 60 per cent. Hence, the private sector\nseems superior in terms of production efficiency. Turning to tariffs, charges are on\naverage 82 per cent higher in the private sector and more customers have their water\nconsumption metered where services are privatised.5 Metering water can be a means of\nextracting higher revenues from consumers by linking payments to the volumes of water\nused. The private sector also achieves a lower percentage of water losses, averaging 29\nper cent as against 34.8 per cent for state-owned water firms (probably assisted by more\n13\nmetering). But, interestingly, other measures of customer service suggest smaller\ndifferences between the private and state sectors. On average, state-owned firms supply\npiped water for 17 hours per day, while the private sector records a slightly lower figure of\n16 hours. The state and private sectors serve about the same percentage of population in\ntheir areas, 63 per cent and 64 per cent respectively.\nThe standard deviation figures in parentheses in Table 2 confirm a high degree of variance\nin performance within both the state and private sector categories for each of the measures.\nThese results suggest that conclusions based on average performance need to be\ninterpreted with care. This is confirmed by the F-test results (shown in the final column of\nTable 2) for the difference in means for the public and private utilities\u2019 performance\nratios, none of which are statistically significant. Also, calculations using the SPBNET\ndata base suggest that in Africa privately-owned water utilities are on average over twice\nas large as state-owned ones in terms of the total volume of water distributed (92m as\nagainst 36.4m cu.mts. per day) and have more connections to their systems (averaging\n159,600 in the case of the private utilities, as against 94,500 in the case of the state-owned\nfirms). This may partially account for the private utilities\u2019 somewhat better performance\nin terms of labour productivity.\nTherefore, to provide a fuller appraisal of relative performance two further sets of\nperformance measures were calculated, drawing on the same data base, using stochastic\nfrontier analysis (SFA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA).\n14\nThe Cost Function Analysis\nA cost function was estimated on the basis of the SBPNET database. The reason for\nchoosing a cost frontier instead of a production frontier lies in the fact that most water\nutility firms are required to meet demand and are not free to choose the level of output.\nWith output set exogenously, the firm is expected to minimise the costs of producing a\ngiven level of output. The coefficients of the cost function can be estimated by OLS\nregression analysis. Alternatively, a stochastic cost frontier model estimated by the\nMaximum Likelihood (ML) method can be used. Compared to the OLS model, the\nstochastic cost frontier model decomposes the error term into stochastic noise (\u03bdi ) and\ncost inefficiency (\u03bci ).\nVarious distributions have been suggested for the inefficiency term in the stochastic cost\nfunction. Two of the most commonly used are the half-normal distribution (Aigner,\nLovell and Schmidt, 1977) and truncated-normal distribution (Stevenson,1980). The\ntruncated-normal distribution is a generalisation of the half-normal distribution, obtained\nby the truncation at zero of the normal distribution, with mean, \u00b5, and variance, 2\n\u00f3\u00ec . Pre-\nassigning \u00b5 to be zero reduces the truncated distribution to half-normal. The appropriate\nmodel for estimation can be determined by testing the null hypothesis H0: \u00b5=0. If the\nhypothesis \u00b5=0 is rejected, this means that the assumption of the truncated distribution is\ncorrect. If \u00b5 is not significantly different from zero, a model assuming a half-normal\ndistribution should be estimated instead.\n15\nFollowing the parameterisation proposed in Battese and Correa (1977), 2\u00f3\u00ec and 2\n\u00f3v are\nreplaced with 2\n\u00f3 = 2 \u00f3\u00ec + 2\n\u00f3v , \u03b3= 2 \u00f3\u00ec \/( 2 \u00f3\u00ec + 2\n\u00f3v ). This is done to allow the application\nof maximum likelihood estimates. The parameter \u03b3 lies between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating\nthat the deviation from the frontier is due entirely to noise and 1 indicating that deviation is\ndue purely to inefficiency. The superiority of a stochastic frontier can be\ntested by the null hypothesis, H0: \u03b3 =0. If the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, this\nindicates that the inefficiency term should be removed from the model, leaving a\nspecification with parameters that can be consistently estimated using OLS.\nThe stochastic cost function has been widely specified as a Cobb-Douglas function or as a\ntranslog cost function. A generalised likelihood\u2013ratio test was used to test whether a\nCobb-Douglas function was appropriate. The result showed that the null hypothesis of the\nCobb-Douglas specification cannot be rejected. In addition, Leamer\u2019s extreme bound\nanalysis was conducted and it showed that the range of the coefficients of the key\nvariables for the Cobb-Douglas function was much smaller than that of the translog\nmodel.6 This confirms that the employment of the Cobb-Douglas specification is\nappropriate. In order to account for variable return to scale, the quadratic term of the\noutput variable was included, however, the coefficient was statistically insignificant.7 A\nlikelihood ratio test was conducted and the results also pointed to the standard Cobb-\nDouglas specification.\nFollowing the literature, we estimated the cost function using data on the cost level, the\noutput level and input prices. Data availability required us to use operating and\nmaintenance costs (COST) or non-capital coats, as the dependent variable in the cost\n16\nfrontier. An arbitrary cost function was therefore formulated which excluded the price of\nthe capital input.8 Average manpower cost per employee ( M P ) was used to reflect the cost\nof labour, and material costs per unit of water distributed (MAT) were included as an\nadditional determinant of non-capital costs. The amount of water distributed per year\n( W D ) was included in the cost function as the output variable. Also included in the\nfunction was a quality variable, measured by the hours of piped water available per day\n( Q U A L I ) . 9\nA number of control or environmental variables were also included to capture cross\ncountry heterogeneity in the political, legal and economic environment.10 Good\ngovernance in the form of sound finance and regulatory systems and protection of property\nrights has been found to be an important explanation of economic performance differences\n(North, 1990; Jalilian et al., 2002; Kaufman et al., 2002), including in water services\n(Estache and Kouassi, 2002). The freedom variable (FRD) developed by the Fraser\nInstitute (http:\/\/www.freetheworld) was therefore included to capture wider governance or\nregulatory effects on performance in water utilities, which might otherwise have been\nattributed to ownership. An index of property rights (PROPERTY) was used as a measure of\nthe quality of the investment environment. The fiscal balance variable (BALANCE)\nproxies the quality of macro economic management in the form of budgetary policy. A\ndensity variable, measured by population served per connection ( D E N ) , was included\nbecause it plays an important role in defining the network infrastructure.11 Another\nvariable used as a control was the annual water resources per capita ( W R S ) . GDP per\ncapita ( G D P ) was included in an attempt to capture the extent of\n17\neconomic development. Finally, to account for the effects of ownership on performance, a\ndummy variable ( O N S ) was included in the model, which took the value of 1 if the\nutility had private capital, as defined earlier.\nAll variables except the ownership variable and those in index or percentage terms were\nlogged. In total 76 observations were included in the estimations, including ten private\nsector operations. The programme FRONTIER 4.1 was used to obtain the maximum\nlikelihood estimates of the parameters and the efficiency measures. The procedure for\nestimation was as follows. An Error-Component (EC) model was first estimated with the\nassumption of a half-normal distribution for the inefficiency term. 12 In order to test the\nrobustness of the results on ownership, a Technical Efficiency Effects (TEE) frontier was\nthen estimated in which the inefficiency effects were expressed as a function of the\nownership dummy.13\nThe first three columns of Table 3 show the results for the EC model. The OLS estimates\nare also shown in the table for comparative purposes. The value of \u03b3 in the EC model\nsuggests a high (0.98) ratio of the variance of inefficiency to the total residual variance.14\nAnalogously, the high value of \u03b3 means that the stochastic frontier is superior to OLS\nmodelling in explaining the cost structure of the water utilities. This is also confirmed by\nthe generalised likelihood \u2013ratio (LR) statistic, which exceeds the critical value at the 1\nper cent level.15 We therefore concentrate on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) results in\nTable 3.\n18\n(Table 3 here)\nFrom the results of the half-normal EC model, it can be seen that the output variable,\nln(WD), has a positive and significant effect on operating costs. This is in line with normal\nexpectation. Similarly, the variables of service quality (ln(QUALI)), labour price (ln(MP))\nand material cost (ln(MAT)) are all significant and correctly signed. The negative and\nstatistically significant (at the 10 per cent level) coefficient for the water resources variable\n(lnWRS) is also consistent with our expectations. We would expect that the costs of water\nproduction and distribution tend to be lower in countries where water resources are\nabundant. The negative coefficients of income per capita (ln(GDP)) and the freedom index\n(FRD) suggest that the operational costs of the utilities may be lower in countries which\nare wealthier and sounder in terms of general institutional governance. However, the effects\nare not statistically significant. More robust evidence of the influence of institutional\ndevelopment is provided by the property rights variable (PROPERTY) which shows\nnegative and significant effects on the cost level. This indicates that costs are lower in\ncountries where property rights and therefore private investment are better protected. The\nimpact of the government fiscal management measure (BALANCE) appears to be trivial.\nContrary to our expectation, however, the results for the density variable (DEN) are\nstatistically insignificant. Turning to the role of ownership, which is our main concern, the\ncoefficient of the ownership dummy (ONS) is positive, suggesting that private ownership is\nassociated with higher costs. However, the result is not statistically significant.\n19\nIn order to determine the robustness of this result, we estimated a TEE model in which the\ninefficiency term was expressed as a function of the ownership dummy. In the TEE\nmodel the inefficiency error \u00eci has a mean of mi and mi = \u00e4 x i . xi , which is a vector of\nvariables that may influence the efficiency of a firm. This was taken as the ownership\ndummy in our estimation. The results of the ML estimation (Table 3, final column) show\nthat the coefficient \u03b4(ONS) is positive but not statistically significant. This finding is\nconsistent with the outcome from the EC model for ownership.\nThe Data Envelopment (DEA) Analysis16\nA DEA analysis was also undertaken in which water distributed was represented by the\nvolume of output produced and hours of piped water available per day was used as the\nproxy for the quality of water services (unaccounted for water and the percentage of\nsamples that failed to meet the quality standards were also used as the quality of service\nproxy and the results were very similar). An input-oriented, variable returns to scale model\nwas adopted to allow for the variation in size of the utilities.17 The number of utilities\nentered into the analysis was 66 of which nine were private. The inputs used were manpower\ncost per employee (because number of staff would not reflect the average skill level of\nstaff18), material cost per unit of water distributed and the number of water treatment\nworks. Using a Tobit model, the efficiency scores from the initial DEA analysis were\nregressed on the control variables, namely, DEN, WRS, GDP, FRD, PROPERTY, AND\nBALANCE (as defined earlier). The results of the Tobit analysis showed that only DEN\nand PROPERTY were statistically significant, and these two variables were included as\ncontrol variables in a second stage DEA analysis.19\n20\nTable 4 summarises the final DEA results according to the number of utilities that\nachieved a score of 100 per cent efficiency, 90 per cent to 99 per cent efficiency and 80\nper cent to 89 per cent efficiency under private and state operation.20 Significantly, state-\nowned firms help to form the efficiency frontier, suggesting that state ownership does not\nnecessarily lead to low relative efficiency. The number of state-owned firms on the\nfrontier amounted to 32 out of the 57 firms or 53 per cent of the total of state-owned firms\nin the data set. Six of the nine private operations included in the analysis populated the\nfrontier. The DEA results appear to be consistent, therefore, with the SFA analysis, in\nsuggesting that the efficiency performance of state-owned water firms in Africa can be\ncomparable to that of private enterprises. However, the results provide stronger evidence for\npossible higher relative efficiency in the private sector as a whole, although it should be\nborn in mind that there are only nine private firms in the sample. For example, no utilities\nwith private sector involvement have less than 70 per cent relative efficiency and 67 per\ncent of private as against 53 per cent of state operations populate the frontier.\n(Table 4 here.)\n4. Transaction Costs and Water Concessions\nBefore concluding the paper, it is interesting to consider why privatisation of water\nservices may be problematic in lower-income economies. The answer seems to lie in a\ncombination of the technology of water provision and the nature of the product, the costs\n21\nof organising long-term concession agreements or transaction costs, and regulatory\nweaknesses, to which we now turn.\nAs already explained, the technology of water supply and the nature of the product,\ntogether, severely restrict the prospects for competition in the market and therefore the\nefficiency gains that can result from encouraging competition following privatisation. This\nleaves rivalry under privatisation mainly in the form of \u2018competition for the market\u2019 or\ncompetition to win the contract or concession agreement. However, here serious problems\ncan arise. These problems relate to the existence of pervasive transaction costs. Transaction\ncosts arise in contracting for water services provision, in terms of the costs of arranging the\nagreements, including organising the bidding process, monitoring contract performance,\nand enforcing the contract terms where failures are suspected (Williamson, 1985). The\neconomics literature suggests that such costs are likely to be high where there are serious\ninformation asymmetries at the time of the contract agreement. These information\nimperfections are likely to be especially prevalent when contracts have to be negotiated to\ncover service provision over long periods of time because many future events that could\naffect the economic viability of the contract and the acceptability of the service offering are\nunforeseen, and may be unforeseeable. Concession agreements in water are typically\nnegotiated for 10 or 20 years or more. Inevitably, therefore, the contracts will need to\npermit periodic adjustment of variables such as price, volume and quality during the\ncontract life. The contract will be incomplete in terms of specifying all of the contingencies\nthat may trigger such adjustments and the form the renegotiation might take. This places a\nlarge emphasis on the skills of both government and companies\n22\nwhen operating water concessions, to ensure as far as possible that the outcome is\nmutually beneficial.\nThe usual approach in water concessions is to have a two-part bidding process. The first\nstage involves the initial selection of approved bidders, based on technical capacity, and\nthen a final stage in which the winner is selected, based on criteria such as the price\noffered and service targets. However, the smaller the number of bidders the greater the\nscope for actual or tacit collusion when bidding and the less effective will be the\ncompetitiveness of the bidding process. The evidence suggests that water concessions in\ndeveloping countries are subject to small numbers bidding (McIntosh, 2003, p.2). For\nexample, in 2001 18 companies expressed interest in operating a contract for Nepal in the\nfirst stage of the process, but in the final stage only two serious bidders remained (cited in\nMitlin, 2002, p.1 7). In Argentina there have usually been only a small handful of\napplicants for water concessions, typically between two and four (Estache, 2002). In an\nattempt to stimulate interest from more potential suppliers, concessions can include\nsovereign (government or donor agency) guarantees of profitability, but this introduces\nobvious moral hazard risks \u2013 with profits guaranteed, what incentive exists for the\nconcession winner to operate efficiently?\nThe literature on transaction costs also suggests that small numbers contracting is a source\nof opportunistic behaviour (Williamson, 1985). The result can be both adverse selection\nand moral hazard. Adverse selection takes the form of sub-optimal contracts at the outset,\nresulting from one of the contracting parties acting opportunistically to arrange\n23\nespecially favourable terms; while moral hazard occurs when one of the contracting\nparties renegotiates the terms of the contract in their favour during its lifetime. During\ncontract renegotiation either the company or the government could be the loser,\ndepending upon the results of the renegotiation.21\nGuasch (2004) concludes that 75 per cent of water and sanitation concession contracts in\nLatin America and the Caribbean were renegotiated significantly within a few years of\nbeing signed \u2013 in Buenos Aires prices were raised within months of the start of the water\nconcession (Alcazar et al., 2000). But even the ability to renegotiate terms may not be\nsufficient to overcome investor reluctance to participate in water privatisations, thus\nreinforcing the small numbers bargaining problem. Difficulties arise especially when\nprivate investors fear that there is no long term political commitment to water\nprivatisation (Rivera, 1996). Moreover, corrupt payments to win concessions and\n\u2018cronyism\u2019 may compromise the legitimacy of the privatisation process; for example, in\nLesotho the Highlands Water Project was associated with bribes to government officials\n(Bayliss, 2000, p.14). Esguerra (2002) shows how the water concessions in Manila were\nbacked by the Philippines\u2019 two wealthiest families with support from multinationals: \u2018It\nappears that the two companies\u2019 approach was to win the bid at all costs, and then deal\nwith the problems of profitability later\u2019 (ibid., p.2).\nStudying concession contracts in developing countries, Harris et al. (2003) find that water\nand sewerage concessions have the second highest incidence of post-contract cancellation\nafter toll roads. Given the existence of substantial potential \u2018sunk costs\u2019 in the water\n24\nindustry, this is not surprising. Tamayo et al. (1999, p.91) note that the specificity of\nassets in the water industry is three to four times that in telecommunications and\nelectricity. Handley (1997) stresses the problems caused by inadequate risk management\ntechniques in developing countries; while the preference on the part of the private sector for\nthe state to remain responsible for the infrastructure in water contracting reflects the\ndesire of companies to minimise their sunk costs. Transaction costs in water concessions\nreinforce serious weaknesses in government regulatory capacity in developing countries\n(Spiller and Savedoff, 1999, pp.1-2). For example, in India there have been some local\nmoves to attract private capital into water supply, notably in Tiruppur, Maharashtra and\nGujarat. But regulatory systems are underdeveloped and in Tiuppur they appear to be\nlargely under the indirect control of the water operator (Teri, 2003, pp.1 71-21). As Mitlin\n(2002, pp.54-55) concludes on the experience in Manila:\nThe experience in Manila suggests that the gains [from privatisation] may be less\nthan anticipated because the assumption that the involvement of the private sector\nwould remove political interference from the water sector was wrong. It may be\nthat processes and outcomes have simply become more complex because the water\nsupply industry now has the interests of private capital in addition to a remaining\nlevel of politicisation and an acute level of need amongst the poorest citizens.\nTo assess the effects of regulation on water privatisation in Africa we repeated our\nstochastic cost function analysis, but this time incorporating a regulatory variable as a\n25\ndummy alongside the existing freedom variable (representing wider good governance in a\ncountry). The SPBNET data base provides information on the existence of regulation of\nprices, water quality and customer services. The different regulatory indicators were\nincluded separately in the regressions. We also combined the three measures into a\ncomposite regulation dummy to reflect the existence or lack of existence of regulation in\nwater. Our expectation was that regulation would impact on costs depending upon the\nform regulation takes. For example, a good regulatory regime should create more investor\ncertainty and may reduce the costs of capital. Alternatively, regulation could raise costs by\nimposing higher and more expensive quality standards or by raising uncertainty for\ninvestors. The results from this regression analysis showed that the composite regulation\ndummy and the water quality and services dummies each had a negative sign, suggesting\nthat the existence of regulation lowered operating costs. However, these results were not\nstatistically significant. The regulation dummy for tariff regulation was positively signed\nand statistically significant, suggesting that regulation of prices increased costs.\nThe findings from this stage of the analysis were, therefore, inconclusive.22 Regulation,\nboth sector specific and as reflected in the general standards of governance in a country,\nproved to be statistically insignificant. The single exception related to tariff regulation\nand this result is consistent with recent concerns that state regulation can raise costs\n(World Bank, 2004b). However, the regulation variables used are far from ideal and\nfuture research would benefit from developing a set of superior regulatory variables that\nmore closely reflect the form of regulation rather than simply its existence.\n26\n5. Conclusions\nThis paper has reviewed the existing econometric evidence on the impact of water\nprivatisation in developing countries and has reported the results of a new analysis for\nAfrica, using a range of performance measures and data for 2000. The study has reported\nstatistical indicators of performance and both DEA and stochastic cost frontier results. In\nprinciple, privatisation has the potential to improve water services in developing\ncountries, reversing decades of underinvestment and low productivity under state supply.\nHowever, the results, taken together, do not provide strong evidence of differences in the\nperformance of state-owned water utilities and water utilities involving some private\ncapital in Africa. While the DEA results point tentatively to private sector superiority, the\nSFA provides some but statistically insignificant evidence that state-owned utilities have the\nbetter cost performance. The descriptive statistics suggest no statistically significant\ndifferences.\nOur results therefore complement those of Estache and Rossi (2002), who also failed to\nfind evidence of superior performance on the part of privately-owned water utilities in\ndeveloping countries. Estache and Kouassi (2002) reported a statistically significant result\nfor the effect of privatisation. However, this was based on data for three privatised utilities\nin a total sample of 21 water utilities in Africa, and governance and institutional factors\nwere found to be much more significant in explaining performance. Admittedly our results\ncontrast with the findings of Crampes and Estache, 1996, and Galiani et al., 2002, who\nconcentrated upon service coverage. They concluded that privatisation led to\n27\nbenefits in terms of numbers provided with safe water and sanitation. We found no real\ndifference in the percentage of the population served, but due to limited availability of\ndata we were unable to explore this dimension of service in detail. We acknowledge that\nour findings like those of the earlier studies are dependent upon the data inputted and this\nwas far from ideal. There is also the possibility that governments in Africa turned to\nprivate capital for the worst performing water utilities, thus making it less likely that we\nwould find evidence of superior private sector performance.\nThe paper then considered some reasons why water privatisation might prove problematic\nin lower-income economies, identifying potential difficulties stemming from water supply\ntechnology and the nature of the product, transaction costs and regulatory capacity. These\ndifficulties may help explain why private ownership does not have an unequivocally\npositive effect on performance in water supply in our and some earlier studies. By\nincluding regulation dummies in the stochastic cost frontier model, we attempted to shed\nfurther light on the importance of regulation, but the results were mainly statistically\ninsignificant. This outcome may reflect the crudity of the regulatory variables used, which\nsimply measure the existence of water regulation not its impact on the management of\nutilities. Under conditions of perfect competition, perfect information and complete\ncontracts ownership does not matter (Shapiro and Willig, 1990) and the regulatory\nenvironment becomes trivial. However, none of these conditions applies to water services\nand it is to be expected that governance and regulatory variables will be important in\ndetermining performance pre and post-privatisation.\n28\nFinally, it needs to be stressed that the provision of affordable, safe and accessible water to\nthe poor is a fundamental priority for low income countries. Policy makers and regulators\nare likely to face difficult trade-offs between allowing firms to charge prices high enough\nto recover costs and ensuring that poor households are provided with affordable water\nsupplies, while at the same time attracting the necessary foreign capital and technical\ncapabilities to upgrade and expand the water supply network. We found that private\noperation of water facilities is associated with much higher average water charges. Also,\nwe found that private involvement tended to lead to more water metering - but what is the\nimpact of this on water consumption and health? Water privatisation usually means the\ninvolvement of a handful of major international companies - but what effect does this\nhave in terms of developing indigenous ownership and regulation of socially important\nassets?23 Also, if privatisation leads to full cost recovery in water, is this outcome\ncompatible with poverty reduction; and what are the environmental implications of\nprivatisation? Clearly, water privatisation raises a complex set of political economy\nquestions that deserve fuller exploration than has been possible here because of data\nlimitations.\n29\nReferences\nAigner, D., Lovell, C. and Schmidt, P.

(1998) emphasise, we can have more confidence in comparative analysis if different\nmeasurements produce reasonably consistent conclusions.\n3 Data for a few utilities relate to the years 1999 or 2001. Given the closeness of the years, we treat all of\nthe data as applying to one year, 2000, to adopt a cross-sectional analysis of performance. The descriptive\nstatistics for the sample are given in appendix 1.\n4 Concession and management and lease contracts, together with privately owned assets, are categorised as\nprivate utilities. The utilities classified as private were cross-checked with the World Bank\u2019s PPI database.\nThe countries in our database with private water utilities are Cape Verde, Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Gabon,\nGhana, Kenya, Nigeria, Morocco, Republic of Guinea, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia and Zambia.\n5 Admittedly, tariff figures have to be viewed with care as tariff levels are affected by public policy towards\nsubsidies.\n43\n6 We applied the Leamer\u2019s Extreme Bound Analysis to the Cobb-Douglas and the translog specifications.\nAccordingly, the output and input variables were treated as \u2018focus\u2019 variables and control variables as\n\u2018doubtful\u2019 variables. The bounds yielded from the Cobb-Douglas model were much narrower than those\nfrom the translog model. In addition, in the translog model the bound for the material input variable\nspanned zero. The results suggested that coefficients for the Cobb-Douglas model were more robust than\nthose for the translog specification.\n7 The full results for these tests are available from the authors.\n8 A similar procedure is followed in Estache and Rossi (2002). In response to a referee\u2019s comment that the\nexclusion of a fixed capital measure may result in a misspecification of the cost function, we tested an\nalternative specification of the cost function where the number of water treatment plants was included as a\nproxy variable for capital costs. The results for the ownership variable were unaffected.\n9 Alternative quality indicators, namely unaccounted for water and the percentage of samples that fail to\nmeet quality standards were also tested, with similar results.\n10 See Rodrik et al (2004) and Glaeser et al (2004) for a discussion of the use of institutional quality\nvariables in quantitative analysis.\n11 We are grateful to a referee for pointing out that this density measure does not fully capture the\ndispersion of connections since it does not allow for the number of connections per building.\nUnfortunately, data on the more common measures of dispersion, such as connections per km of main or\nconnections per square km, were not available.\n12 The Error Component model is the standard form of stochastic frontier model used in the literature. It\ndecomposes the error term into stochastic noise and cost inefficiency. The results of the EC model with the\ntruncated-distribution assumption showed that u was 0.47 with a standard error of 2.56. A likelihood ratio test\nwas performed and the results showed that the hypothesis u=0 could not be rejected at the 10 per cent level.\nConsequently, the results from the model with the half-normal assumption were adopted.\n13 The Technical Efficiency Effect model can be used to investigate the determinants of technical\ninefficiencies among firms. Compared to the Error Component model, the Technical Efficiency Effects\n44\nFrontier is a stochastic frontier model that explicitly formulates technical inefficiency effects in terms of\nfirm-specific factors. All parameters were estimated in a single-stage Maximum Likelihood procedure.\n14 A referee has pointed out that the error term may be capturing more than just inefficiency where there is\nmisspecification because of heterogeneity and\/or measurement problems. We accept this reservation.\n15 The critical value was obtained from Kodde and Palm (1986).\n16 We are grateful to Catarina Figueira for assistance with the DEA analysis.\n17 A constant returns to scale model produced a similar set of results but with lower overall scores.\n18 We thank one of the referees for drawing this to our attention.\n19 The inclusion of control variables in DEA analysis has been widely used in empirical studies, see, for\nexample, Rugggiero, 1996, 2004; Paradi and Schaffnit, 2004. Wang and Schmidt (2002), however, are\ncritical of this two-step procedure in DEA.\n20 DEA provides scores relative to peers with similar operating characteristics based on an estimated\nefficiency frontier. The resulting scores are relative not absolute scores. Therefore, a score of 100 per cent\ndoes not imply absolute efficiency but merely efficiency compared to the other units in the analysis.\nSimilarly, SFA creates a frontier based on actual performances in the data set.\n21 For example, in the concession involving Maynilad in Manila, the company terminated the concession\nwhen it was refused a rate adjustment to which it considered it was entitled. By contrast, in Dolphin Bay,\nSouth Africa, the municipality felt that it had little alternative but to agree an unplanned price rise when the\nprivate sector supplier threatened to withdraw services (Bayliss, 2002, p.16).\n22 The detailed results can be obtained from the authors. A Tobit model was used to assess the impact of the\nregulation variables on the DEA scores discussed earlier. The results were also statistically insignificant.\n23 Kirkpatrick and Parker (2005) discuss the implications of liberalisation of water services under the WTO\nGATS for domestic regulation of water utilities.\n"}
