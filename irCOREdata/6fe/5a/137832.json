Companies are also in \nneed of more efficient methods for internal control and quality assurance. Sampling and \nanalysis methods must be facilitated to encourage more measurements to be performed in the \nworkplace. Methods used for personal exposure measurements are usually based on a two-\nstep procedure; sampling followed by analysis. The sampling step can either be performed by \nusing pumps or by using diffusive sampling devices, where the diffusive samplers have the \nadvantage of being less invasive to the worker\u2019s performance during sampling [1-5]. A \ngeneral disadvantage for these methods is mainly that they are time consuming since the \nsamples usually have to be sent to a laboratory for analysis. Commonly used real-time \ninstruments, on the other hand, have short feedback time, but lack the selectivity of laboratory \ninstruments such as chromatographic systems.  \n \nThese problems can be avoided by using biosensors in real-time monitoring devices. \nAlthough the biological element of the biosensors is sensitive to temperature and humidity, \nsuch sensors can be constructed with high specificity and sensitivity. The principal focus for \nbiosensor development to date has been biomedical applications, but a number of studies have \nbeen reported for air monitoring [6]. \n \nIn this study, formic acid was chosen as a model substance. It has been measured in various \nlocations such as atmosphere [7], museum cabinets [8], farmers\u2019 exposure during silage \nmaking [9] and exhaust emissions [7,10]. When formic acid is sampled it is usually trapped as \nformate using potassium hydroxide on filters but standard adsorbent tubes have also been \nused [9,11]. Formic acid has been analysed both with and without prior derivatisation. When \n  3 \nthe sample is derivatised prior to analysis, standard GC and HPLC methods are generally used \nand when the sample is not derivatised ion chromatography is usually preferred. As formic \nacid was chosen as the model substance, formate dehydrogenase (FDH) was chosen as a \nsuitable enzyme. Formate reacts with FDH in presence of a co-factor, nicotinamide adenine \ndinucleotide (NAD+), which is reduced in the process, producing NADH [12]. Amperometry \nwas chosen to measure the amount of NADH that was reoxidised. To accelerate this process \nMeldola\u2019s blue was introduced as a mediator in the system. Meldola\u2019s blue requires lower \noxidation potential than NADH, which also decreases the risk of interference.  \n \nIn this paper, we describe initial studies for the construction of a diffusive sampling device, \nbased on biosensor technology, for monitoring personal exposure to formic acid. The aim of \nthis piece of work was to ascertain how the biological system could be attached to the screen-\nprinted electrodes to produce a biosensor for air monitoring.  \nExperimental \nBiosensor \nElectrodes \nThe electrodes used in the electrochemical experiments were manufactured by depositing \ncarbon paste on polyester sheets using the technique of screen-printing. Screen-printing is \nnow a well established method which allows inexpensive electrodes to be manufactured easily \nand disposed of after use. \n \nThe working, counter and reference electrodes were printed (Fig. 1A) on the polyester sheets \n(Melinex MSTS725, Cadillac Plastic Limited, Swindon, UK) with a carbon paste (I45 ink, \nMCA, Cambridgeshire, UK). The sheets were then left over night to dry under ambient \n  4 \nconditions. The next step was to print the surface of the reference electrode. This surface \nconsisted of a Ag\/AgCl paste (Ag\/AgCl ink C20R15, MCA, Cambridgeshire, UK) which was \nprinted on top of one of the carbon paste electrodes (Fig. 1B). Since the Ag\/AgCl layer is \nsensitive to light, the sheets were hereafter stored in darkness. When the Ag\/AgCl layer had \ndried an insulation layer (242-SB ink, ESL Europe, Reading, UK) was printed (Fig. 1C). This \nink was dried in an oven at 120\u00b0C for two hours. The design is such that only the electrode \nareas and contact pads are left exposed. After this layer was printed, the sensors were cut to \ntheir final size, which was approximately 15 x 50 mm (Fig. 1D). All screen printing was \ncarried out with a DEK 248 screen-printer (DEK, Weymouth, UK). \n \nFor the electrochemical experiments, the screen-printed sensors were connected to an \nelectrochemical analyser (a \u00b5Autolab type II, from Eco Chemie in Utrecht, the Netherlands) \nby a connector manufactured from an IDC edge connector (Maplin, Milton Keynes, UK) and \nstandard IDC cables. The \u00b5Autolab was controlled by a Digital Celebris 590 PC with GPES \nsoftware (Eco Chemie, Utrecht, the Netherlands).  \n \nSeventeen electrodes were used to investigate the variability of the electrochemical response \nof the electrodes. The variability was measured in a stirred solution containing phosphate \nbuffer (0.1 M, pH 7.0 with 0.1 M KCl) and 5.3 x 10-5 M Meldola\u2019s blue (hemi salt, 90 % dye, \nSigma, Sweden). The electrodes were connected to the electrochemical analyser and \nimmersed in the solution. A potential of -50 mV versus the internally printed Ag\/AgCl \nreference electrode was applied. After 500 seconds, a 10 \u00b5l aliquot of a 2 \u00b5g\/\u00b5l solution of \nNADH (99 %, Sigma, Sweden) was added and the peak heights measured.  \n  5 \nEnzymes system and immobilisation \nInitial enzyme immobilisation experiments were performed using alginate gel, SOL-GEL [13] \nand glycerol solution, respectively. The sol-gel method was discarded because the transparent \nsilica gel did not adhere properly to the surface of the screen-printed electrodes and hence \ncracked. The alginate gel was prepared by mixing approximately 20 \u00b5l of a 4 % sodium \nalginate solution, dissolved in a phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 7.0 with 0.1 M KCl), with 7 \u00b5l \nof a 20 U\/ml solution of FDH (from yeast, Fluka, Sweden), 2 \u00b5l of a 40 mg\/ml solution of \nNAD+ (98 %, Sigma, Sweden) and 1 \u00b5l of a 20 mg\/ml solution of Meldola's blue. \nApproximately 10 \u00b5l of the gel was placed on an electrode and the electrode was then dipped \nin 0.1 M CaCl2 to complete the gel. The glycerol solution used to immobilise the enzyme, \ncofactor and mediator on the screen-printed electrodes consisted of a mixture of glycerol and \nphosphate buffer. Glycerol has been used previously in a biosensor for analysing phenol in air \nand proved to be very efficient in this application, mainly because of its ability to retain water \nand its ability to concentrate phenol in the gel [14]. The glycerol solution consisted of 80 % \n(w\/w) glycerol (99 %, Sigma,UK) and 20 % (w\/w) phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.2 with 0.1 \nM KCl). An aliquot (20 \u00b5l) of the solution was mixed with 7 \u00b5l of a 20 U\/ml solution of FDH, \n2 \u00b5l of a 40 mg\/ml solution of NAD+ and 1 \u00b5l of a 20 mg\/ml solution of Meldola's Blue. An \naliquot (10 \u00b5l) of this mixture was applied to the screen-printed sensor to cover all three \nelectrodes. The comparison was performed by measuring the gaseous formic acid above an \nequilibrated 0.012 M solution of formic acid using the two different types of immobilisation \nmethod. In the initial comparison of alginate gel and glycerol solution, glycerol was found to \nhave a quicker and larger response to formic acid in air. Glycerol was therefore chosen as the \nimmobilisation medium for the following experiments.  \n  6 \nMembranes.  \nTo ensure that the glycerol solution was secured on the electrodes, gas permeable membranes \nwere placed on top of the glycerol solution. Six types of membrane, all acquired from \nMillipore (Sundbyberg, Sweden) were investigated (Table 1). \n \nThe membranes were cut into squares of approximately 14 x 14 mm. Aliquots of 10 \u00b5l of the \nglycerol solution were placed on the electrodes and the membranes were attached to the \nelectrodes by applying small amounts of cyanoacrylate glue (Loctite 420, Loctite Sweden AB, \nGothenburg, Sweden) to the edges of the membrane squares. The electrodes were then \nconnected to the electrochemical analyser and exposed to formic acid in an exposure \nchamber. The potential was -50 mV versus the internally printed Ag\/AgCl reference electrode \nand the current at steady state was measured. \n \nIn an investigation of storage stability, 42 electrodes, using the LS5 membrane, were prepared \nas above. The storage was performed by placing 18 electrodes each in 4\u00baC and -15\u00baC. After \nstoring the electrodes for 1, 2 and 3 days, 6 electrodes from each storage condition were \nanalysed each day. The analyses were performed by exposing the electrodes to formic acid in \nair and measuring the current at steady state.  \nTesting the biosensor \nThe biosensor constructed as described above, was tested in an exposure chamber with known \nconcentrations of formic acid in the atmosphere. The formic acid concentrations were set to \n1.9, 3.7 and 5.6 mg\/m3, which is near the Swedish threshold limit value for formic acid. The \nSwedish National Board of Occupational Safety and Health has set the limit value at 5 mg\/m3 \n[15] and the limit value stated by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial \nHygienists has been set at 9.4 mg\/m3 [16]. The biosensor was introduced in the chamber \n  7 \nbefore the formic acid was added to give it time to equilibrate. The amperometric analysis, \ncontrolled from the \u00b5Autolab, was then started by applying the potential (-50 mV versus the \ninternally printed Ag\/AgCl reference electrode). When the signal had reached a steady state \n(approximately 3 minutes) the micro-injection pump was started and the formic acid \natmosphere, at 1.9 mg\/m3, was generated in the exposure chamber. After 20 minutes, the \nconcentration of the formic acid atmosphere was increased to 3.7 mg\/m3 and after another 20 \nminutes the concentration was increased to 5.6 mg\/m3.  \nGeneration of formic acid atmosphere \nTo ensure better control of the formic acid atmosphere during sampling, standard atmospheres \nwere generated using a purpose-built generation system (Fig. 2). A solution of 40 mg\/ml \nformic acid, diluted from concentrated formic acid (98-100 %, Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn, Seelze, \nGermany) was used to generate standard atmospheres. A micro-injection pump (CMA\/100, \nCarnegie Medicin, Stockholm, Sweden) with a 5 ml syringe (model 1005, Hamilton, Nevada, \nUSA) slowly injected the formic acid solution into a nebuliser (Meinhard nebulizer TR-30-\nA3, J E Meinhard Associates Inc., California, USA) and compressed air was led through the \nnebuliser to facilitate evaporation of the formic acid. The air mixture was firstly diluted in the \nmixing chamber with compressed dry air and secondly diluted with humidified air giving the \nrequired atmosphere in the exposure chamber. The temperature and relative humidity was \nmeasured at the exhaust of the exposure chamber, with an HMI 14a R.H. & T indicator \n(Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland). Similar generation systems have been used to generate other \ncompounds [3,4,17]. The relative humidity was set to 50 % throughout all the experiments, by \nregulating the airflow through a moisturising outfit consisting of three, water-filled, dispersion \nbottles. The concentration was adjusted by changing the injection speed of the micro-injection \npump. \n  8 \nResults and discussion \nVariability of the electrode response \nThe relative standard deviation of the electrochemical response of the screen-printed \nelectrodes was 13 % (n=17). The experiments were performed over four days and each day \nnew solutions were made. No difference was observed in the size of the signal with time, \neither between or within groups. \nSystem for immobilisation of the enzyme \nWhen the enzyme system was immobilised in glycerol the response was larger and quicker \ncompared to immobilisation in alginate gel (Fig. 3). The alginate gel has a less permeable \nstructure and this probably caused the difference in response. For this reason, glycerol was \nchosen as the immobilisation media. \nChoice of membrane \nOf the six membrane were investigated, the LS5 membrane gave a stable response for over 60 \nminutes and the relative standard deviation of steady state current between six electrodes was \n15 %. The AA08 membrane was not suitable for this application and produced no signal, \nprobably because of the ability of the membrane to absorb the glycerol solution into the \nmembrane. Electrodes with the fluoropore membrane (FG02, FH05, FA1 and FS3) all \nproduced larger responses than electrodes with the LS5 membrane, but they also exhibited \nlarger variation in the signal within each group of electrodes. Fig. 4A shows the experiments \nperformed with the LS5 membrane and Fig. 4B shows the experiments performed with the \nFA1 membrane as an example of the fluoropore membrane type. All fluoropore membranes \ngave a similar response as the FA1 membrane, with larger response but much greater \nvariation in the signal. Some of the electrodes with fluoropore membrane did not maintain a \n  9 \nsteady response for 60 minutes as can be seen in Fig. 4B. Although the response was lower \nfor the electrodes with the LS5 membrane, this membrane was chosen for further \ninvestigation since the stability within the group of electrodes was better.  \nLinearity of sensor response \nWhen the biosensors were exposed to formic acid concentrations between 1.9 and 5.6 mg\/m3 \nthe biosensors responded well to the increase in concentration in the test atmosphere, as can \nbe seen in Fig. 5. A fast response time was achieved, which indicates that the device could be \nused as a real-time monitor. Six experiments were performed using the same conditions and \nall the responses showed the same pattern. One of the biosensors, however, did have \napproximately 17 % lower response. This is illustrated in Fig. 6 by the three points well below \nthe calibration curve. It also shows a linear correlation between the formic acid concentrations \nand the responses. \nStorage stability \nFig. 7 shows that the performance of the biosensors was not maintained after storage. The \namperometric response decreased by 50 % after only one days storage at -15\u00baC. Since storage \nstability is an important feature, this has to be improved in the future development of the \nbiosensor. When the biosensors were stored at 4\u00baC the response decreased by 80 % after one \ndays storage. \nConclusions and future work \nThis study has shown, for the first time, that there is potential for a simple, inexpensive and \nspecific personal passive \u201dreal-time\u201d sampler based on biosensor technology, for \nmeasurement of formic acid in air. The enzyme system can be immobilised in glycerol and \nkept in place using a gas-permeable membrane producing electrodes with a stable and linear \n  10 \nresponse. However, further development is required to create a device with sufficient \nsensitivity, response time and storage stability for practical application.  \n  11 \nReferences \n 1 R. Lindahl, J.-O.
