This is due to diamond\u2019s unique mechani-\ncal and electrical properties, which include a wide band gap\n\u0001\u00055.5 eV\u0002, high electron and hole mobilities \u00011800 and\n1200 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, respectively\u0002, high resistivity\n\u0001\u00011011 \u0002 cm\u0002, and very low device dark currents.1,2 Unfor-\ntunately, the presence of defects and polycrystalline grain\nboundaries leads to significant charge trapping and recombi-\nnation, resulting in reduced charge drift lengths and degraded\ndetector performance. Various authors have tentatively iden-\ntified trapping states in CVD diamond, although there is no\nclear picture of the role of particular levels, or bands of\nstates, in affecting charge transport performance. However, it\nis accepted that CVD diamond contains both deep levels,\nresponsible for short carrier lifetimes, and one or more shal-\nlow levels that are partially ionized at room temperature.\nSeveral techniques have been used to study the defect states\nin diamond; for example, Glesener3 measured a boron-\nrelated level with an activation energy of 0.29 eV in boron-\ndoped diamond using photoinduced current transient spec-\ntroscopy \u0001PICTS\u0002. A wide range of deeper levels has been\nreported, including Gonon et al.4 and Hearne et al.,5 who\nreported activation energies of 1.86 and 1.1 eV, respectively,\nmeasured using thermally stimulated current technique\n\u0001TSC\u0002. Bruzzi et al.6 reported a variety of defect levels in\nelectronic-grade polycrystalline CVD diamond, with activa-\ntion energies in the range 0.3\u20131.5 eV, observed using both\nTSC and PICTS. Alpha particle response measurements are a\npowerful technique to separate the charge transport and car-\nrier lifetimes of electrons and holes. Marinelli et al.7 used an\nanalysis of alpha-particle pulse shapes as a function of tem-\nperature to deduce a \u201cshallow\u201d hole trap with an activation\nenergy of 0.35 eV.

Redistribution subject tofrom alpha-particle pulse shapes. By digitally processing the\npreamplifier pulse shapes, pulse rise-time spectra are gener-\nated as a function of temperature, and an Arrhenius plot is\ndeduced. An activation energy of 0.31\u00b10.03 eV for a shal-\nlow hole trap is determined. Unlike optical transient spec-\ntroscopy methods, such as PICTS, analysis of alpha-particle\npulse shapes allows direct sampling of those trapping states\nthat limit charge transport in diamond radiation detectors.\nThe technique directly samples levels with a thermal emis-\nsion rate in the range of 5\u0003103 to 5\u0003106 s\u22121. The nature of\nthe state, either acting as an electron or hole trap, can also be\ndirectly inferred from the bias polarity of the sample. Con-\nsequently, this technique provides a valuable insight into the\ncarrier trapping-detrapping processes in CVD diamond, and\nthe role of these processes in defining the performance of\npolycrystalline diamond particle detectors.\nThe detector used in these measurements was fabricated\nfrom a 50 \u0004m thick unpolished free-standing CVD polycrys-\ntalline diamond film, with an average grain size on the\ngrowth surface of around 18 \u0004m. The phase purity of the\ndiamond was assessed by Raman spectroscopy, using a Ren-\nishaw micro-Raman spectrometer with an excitation source\nof a diode laser \u0001782 nm line\u0002. Figure 1 shows a room-\ntemperature Raman spectrum of the sample, which shows\nonly one sharp diamond characteristic peak at 1331.9 cm\u22121\nwith a full width at half-maximum of 5.3 cm\u22121. No other\nsp2-bonded carbon phase peaks were detected, indicating a\npure diamond phase.8,9\nA detector structure was fabricated using large-area cir-\ncular metal contact electrodes on both sides of the diamond\nfilm, forming a metal-semiconductor-metal sandwich struc-\nture. The diameter of the contacts was 6 mm. No pre-\nirradiation was carried out on our device before the alpha-\nparticle characterization. During the measurements the\ndetector was placed on a temperature-controlled stage inside\na vacuum chamber and irradiated using alpha particles from\nan uncollimated 5.49 MeV 241Am source, over a temperature\nrange of 240\u2013280 K. The range of the alpha particles into\nthe diamond was around 15 \u0004m, as calculated using SRIM.10\nThe top contact of the detector, corresponding to the growth\n\u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics1-1\n AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\n023501-2 Wang, Sellin, and Lohstroh Appl.

In these measurements a bias voltage of\neither +250 or \u2212250 V \u0001equivalent to a field strength of\n50 kV\/cm\u0002 was used in order to study the effect of either\nhole-dominated or electron-dominated charge transport, re-\nspectively. The preamplifier output was directly connected to\na digital oscilloscope, which captured each pulse on an\nevent-by-event basis. The preamplifier output was also con-\nnected to a multichannel analyzer \u0001MCA\u0002 via a spectroscopy\namplifier \u0001Ortec model 570, shaping time of 2 \u0004s\u0002, which\nacquired pulse height spectra.\nEach alpha-particle interaction in the diamond detector\ncreates N0 free carriers of electrons and holes that drift apart\na total distance l under the action of the applied electric field,\nbefore either reaching the electrode or being trapped in a\ndefect. The electron-hole pairs induce a total charge Q in the\nexternal circuit that is given by Q=eN0l \/d, where e is the\nelectronic charge and d is the detector thickness. Average\ncarrier drift lengths in CVD diamond are typically in the\nrange from \u000510 to \u0001100 \u0004m depending on material qual-\nity, with a high density of trapping sites located at the crys-\ntallite boundaries.\nIn addition to the amplitude of the induced charge,\nanalysis of the preamplifier pulse shapes can give important\nadditional information, particularly related to thermal detrap-\nping from shallow states in diamond. Deep trapping levels,\nfor which there is no thermal re-emission over a measurable\ntime scale, cause a curtailment of the prompt component of\nthe preamplifier pulse rising edge. In contrast, the presence\nof shallow states that thermally re-emit over a\n100 ns\u2013100 \u0004s time scale causes a slow \u201cdelayed\u201d compo-\nnent to the preamplifier pulse rise time.

At \u2212250 V,\nthe pulse shapes due to electron transport contain only one\nprompt time component in the measured temperature range\nfrom 240 to 280 K, as shown in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002.

A typical hole pulse shape is shown in Fig.\n2\u0001b\u0002, which indicates the amplitudes of the fast and slow\ncomponents, AFAST and ASLOW, respectively.

This is considerably slower than\nthe actual electron drift time in the CVD diamond sample\n\u0001typically \u00051 ns\u0002, and is due only to the limiting rise time of\nthe preamplifier. However, the absence of any rise-time com-\nponent over time scales \u000140 ns confirms that electron trap-\nping is dominated by deep levels, which are too deep to\nexhibit measurable detrapping, as previously reported by\nMarinelli et al.12\nFor hole pulses, a significant slow component to the\npulse shape was observed at a bias of +250 V.

The cen-\ntroid of the peak varied from several hundred nanoseconds to\nseveral microseconds over the temperature range\n240\u2013280 K, as shown in Fig. 3, providing direct evidence\nthat the delayed component of the pulse shape is thermally\nactivated. This phenomenon is ascribed to thermal re-\nemission of holes from shallow trapping levels, which act in\naddition to hole trapping from deep levels where re-emission\nis not observed. Marinelli et al.12 also observed thermal re-\nemission of holes from shallow traps in CVD diamond al-\nthough in their device this was only seen after priming, or\n\u201cpumping,\u201d of the diamond film by pre-irradiation with\nx-rays that passivated the deep levels. The observation of\ndetrapping from shallow states in our sample without the\nneed for pre-irradiation suggests that the ratio of shallow\/\ndeep traps is higher in our diamond film.\nWe also measured the rise-time distribution spectra at\ndifferent positive biases, in the range +100 to +400 V, and\nfound that there was no statistically significant change in the\naverage rise time as a function of field strength. This con-\nfirms that the observed slow rise times are not due to direct\n\u0001i.e., non-trap-assisted\u0002 hole transport.\nThe measured temperature-dependent rise times of the\nholes were analyzed in the form of an Arrhenius plot to ob-\ntain the activation energy of the shallow hole state, using a\nmean detrapping time \u0006 calculated from the measured mean\nrise time, where \u0006=s0\n\u22121 exp\u0001EA \/kT\u0002, and s0 is the frequency\nor \u201cescape\u201d factor, EA is the activation energy of traps, k is\nthe Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. The\nArrhenius plot of ln\u0001\u0006\u0002 versus 1000\/T is shown in Fig. 4,\nwith an activation energy deduced from the gradient of EA\n=0.31\u00b10.03 eV. The factor s0, which measures the fre-\nquency at which the particle tries to exceed the barrier, was\nfound to be \u00013\u00b15\u0002\u000310\u221211 Hz. The measured activation en-\nergy of 0.31 eV of the state, or band of states, responsible for\nshallow hole trapping-detrapping, is close to that of 0.29 eV\nmeasured by Glesener3 using photoinduced current transient\nspectroscopy in boron-doped diamond, and of 0.35 eV cal-\nculated as the detrapping time by Marinelli\net al.7 in undoped CVD diamond.

Redistribution subject totrapped before they reach the grain boundaries, which is,\ntherefore, consistent with the observed shallow level being\nlocated within the bulk of the diamond crystallites.\nIn conclusion, rise-time distribution spectra were di-\nrectly measured at negative and positive bias of \u2212250 and\n+250 V over a temperature range from 240 to 280 K, re-\nspectively. Only a prompt time component was observed\nfrom the electron-dominated pulse shapes, with a rise time of\n40 ns due to the limiting preamplifier rise time. The lack of\nany slow component in the electron pulse shapes indicates\nthat electrons are trapped at deep levels with no observable\nthermal detrapping. In contrast, significant delayed time\ncomponents were observed in pulse shapes produced by hole\ntransport when the detector was irradiated by alpha particles\nin the as-grown state. The strong reduction in mean detrap-\nping time as a function of increasing temperature confirms\nthe thermal origin of the slow time component, which is\nascribed to thermal detrapping of holes from shallow levels\nacting as hole traps. The observation of thermal detrapping in\nour detector without pre-irradiation or priming suggests that\nthe ratio of shallow\/deep traps is high in our diamond film.\nAn activation energy level of 0.31\u00b10.03 eV for the shallow\nhole state was directly determined from an Arrhenius plot\nderived from the temperature-dependent rise-time spectra.\n1E.-K.
