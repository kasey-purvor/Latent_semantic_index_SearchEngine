Box 124, SE 221 00 Lund, Sweden\nReceived 7 August 2008; accepted 15 October 2008\nAbstract\nMacroporous hydrogels (MHs), cryogels, are a new type of biomaterials for tissue engineering that can\nbe produced from any natural or synthetic polymer that forms a gel. Synthetic MHs are rendered bioac-\ntive by surface or bulk modifications with extracellular matrix components. In this study, cell response to\nthe architecture of protein ligands, bovine type-I collagen (CG) and human fibrinogen (Fg), immobilised\nusing different methods on poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) macroporous hydrogels (MHs)\nwas analysed. Bulk modification was performed by cross-linking cryo-co-polymerisation of HEMA and\npoly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate (PEGA) in the presence of proteins (CG\/pHEMA and Fg\/pHEMA MHs).\nThe polymer surface was modified by covalent immobilisation of the proteins to the active epoxy (ep)\ngroups present on pHEMA after hydrogel fabrication (CG\u2013epHEMA and Fg\u2013epHEMA MHs). The concen-\ntration of proteins in protein\/pHEMA and protein\u2013epHEMA MHs was 80\u201385 and 130\u2013140 \u00b5g\/ml hydrogel,\nrespectively. It was demonstrated by immunostaining and confocal laser scanning microscopy that bulk\nmodification resulted in spreading of CG in the polymer matrix and spot-like distribution of Fg. On the\ncontrary, surface modification resulted in spot-like distribution of CG and uniform spreading of Fg, which\nevenly coated the surface. Proliferation rate of fibroblasts was higher on MHs with even distribution of\nthe ligands, i.e., on Fg\u2013epHEMA and CG\/pHEMA. After 30 days of growth, fibroblasts formed several\nmonolayers and deposited extracellular matrix filling the pores of these MHs. The best result in terms of\ncell proliferation was obtained on Fg\u2013epHEMA. The ligands displayed on surface of these scaffolds were\nin native conformation, while in bulk-modified CG\/pHEMA MHs most of the proteins were buried inside\nthe polymer matrix and were less accessible for interactions with specific antibodies and cells. The method\nused for MH modification with bioligands strongly affects spatial distribution, density and conformation of\nthe ligand on the scaffold surface, which, in turn, influence cell\u2013surface interactions. The optimal type of\nmodification varies depending on intrinsic properties of proteins and MHs.\n\u00a9 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2009\n* To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Introduction\nDevelopment of biomaterials for tissue engineering is a major area of biomedical\nmaterials research. It is focused on developing three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds\nwith appropriate strength, porosity, degradation times, microstructure and ability\nto elicit specific cellular responses [1\u20133]. Macroporous hydrogels (MHs) produced\nby cryotropic polymerisation represent an interesting group of biomaterials due to\ntheir highly porous 3D structure, elasticity and easily modulated mechanical and\nbiochemical properties [4\u20138]. Cryotropic polymerisation takes place at sub-zero\ntemperatures when most of the solvent is frozen while the dissolved monomers\nor polymer precursors are concentrated in small non-frozen regions, where the gel\nformation proceeds. After melting the solvent crystals that perform like porogen,\na system with large (10\u2013200 \u00b5m) continuous interconnected pores is formed [9, 10].\nMHs prepared from natural sources, as well as synthetic MHs have high potential\nas scaffolds for tissue engineering [11, 12].\nIn order to achieve biomolecular recognition of synthetic materials by cells the\nscaffolds need to be subjected to surface and bulk modification with bioactive mole-\ncules such as extracellular matrix (ECM) components or cell-adhesive peptides\nderived from ECM proteins [13, 14]. Interactions of cells with various synthetic\nmaterials biocoated by means of surface or bulk modification has been a subject of\nextensive studies. Bulk modification is performed by co-polymerisation or attach-\nment of functional groups to the polymer chain before scaffold fabrication and can\nbe achieved through physical [15], chemical [4, 16, 17], photochemical [18] or ionic\ncross-linking [19]. Thus, recognition sites obtained by bulk modification are present\nnot only on the surface but also in the bulk of the materials. Such modification\nwith enzymatically degradable sequences can render biomaterials biodegradable by\nspecific proteases [20, 21]. On the other hand, bulk modification may affect the bi-\nological activity of immobilised molecules due to their reduced mobility within the\nmaterial [22]. It is more difficult to control the density of the ligand accessible for\ncells in bulk-modified materials than in surface-modified materials [23]. The rela-\ntionship between the bulk ligand concentration and the active ligand concentration\nat the surface is dependent on the hydrogel composition [24].\nSurface modification is carried out after scaffold fabrication and is usually\nachieved by covalent binding of peptides or proteins on biomaterial surfaces using\ndifferent coupling techniques [14]. A bi-functional cross-linker that has a spacer\narm can be used for the immobilisation of peptides in order to ensure their flex-\nibility [25]. The type or level of modification which is optimal for cell\u2013surface\ninteraction varies depending on the specific cell types and intrinsic properties of\nbiomaterials [14].\nI. N. Savina et al. \/ Journal of Biomaterials Science 20 (2009) 1781\u20131795 1783\nSynthetic MHs have been modified and rendered bioactive by including ana-\nlogues of cell-adhesive peptides during production of MHs, coupling proteins to\nreactive groups present on MHs either directly or via a spacer [26] and by grafting\nmacromolecules to MHs surface followed by derivatisation of the grafted polymer\nwith required functionality [6, 27, 28]. Despite the possibility of using a wide range\nof techniques for derivatisation of MH scaffolds, the dependence of conformation,\ndensity and distribution of the bioligand in bulk- and surface-modified MHs on the\nmodification method has not been studied previously. Since cellular response is de-\npendent on the density of the ligand [29], the spatial distribution of ligand [30] and\nits biological activity [31], considering these parameters is important for the design\nof biomimetic MH scaffolds.\nIn the present study biomimetic poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA)\nMHs modified by embedding protein during cryo-polymerisation and covalent im-\nmobilisation of two different proteins, bovine type-I collagen (CG) and fibrinogen\n(Fg) from human plasma, were studied in terms of protein spatial organisation and\nsurface density and their effect on cultured human fibroblasts. Previously, it was\ndemonstrated that pHEMA MHs prepared by cross-linking polymerisation in the\nsemi-frozen state, are elastic sponge-like materials which have a unique structure\nof large interconnected pores with pore sizes up to 100 \u00b5m and total porosity of 94\u2013\n97% [6]. pHEMA is inherently non-adhesive to cells, yet it can be rendered adhesive\nby modification with peptides or proteins [32\u201334]. pHEMA hydrogels have found\nwide application in medicine [35], in particular for production of contact lenses and\nartificial cornea [36, 37]. Here, the distribution of two different proteins, fibrinogen\nand collagen, introduced into pHEMA MHs by two different methods and response\nof fibroblasts to the ligand architecture in the MHs has been studied. The potential\nof pHEMA MHs subjected to surface and bulk modifications as scaffolds for tissue\nengineering, such as wound healing, has been evaluated.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Materials\nN,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-Tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED, 99%), bicinchoninic acid (BCA)\nprotein assay kit, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), bovine dermal type-I colla-\ngen (collagen from calf skin), fibrinogen from human plasma, monoclonal mouse\nantibody against bovine type-I collagen, monoclonal mouse antibody against hu-\nman fibrinogen, anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific)-FITC antibody produced in goat and\na 2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxyanilide inner\nsalt (XTT) based + 1% phenazine methosulfate (PMS) in vitro toxicology assay kit\nwere purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate\n(PEGA, Mn approx. 258), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA, 98%), allyl gly-\ncidyl ether (AGE, 99%), dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) and ammonium persulfate\n(APS, 98%) were obtained from Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Dulbecco\u2019s mod-\nified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) with phenol red, glucose, glutamax and pyruvate,\n1784 I. N. Savina et al. \/ Journal of Biomaterials Science 20 (2009) 1781\u20131795\nand DMEM without pyruvate and phenol red, Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS), trypsin-\nEDTA and kanamycine were obtained from Gibco-Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY,\nUSA).\nHuman embryonic fibroblasts were provided by the Department of Biological\nSciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology (Kanpur, India) as a\nkind gift.\n2.2. Preparation of Macroporous Hydrogels\nThe composition of the reaction mixtures used for production of plain (non-\nmodified), epoxy-containing, Fg\/pHEMA and CG\/pHEMA MHs is presented in\nTable 1. For Fg\/pHEMA and CG\/pHEMA MHs preparation, collagen and fibrino-\ngen (0.5 mg\/ml) were dissolved in water before the monomers were added. The\npreparation of MHs was carried out as follows. Each reaction mixture was de-\ngassed in vacuo for 10 min to eliminate dissolved oxygen and cooled on an ice\nbath for 10 min. Free radical polymerisation was initiated by adding TEMED and\nAPS (1.0% each of the total co-monomers weight) and the mixture was stirred\nfor 10\u201315 s. Then 0.25 ml of the solution was quickly added into each glass tube\n(20 \u00d7 7 mm i.d.) closed at the bottom with a silicon cap. The solution in the tubes\nwas frozen within 20\u201330 min in the ARCTEST cooling chamber at \u221212\u25e6C, incu-\nbated at that temperature overnight and thawed at room temperature. Caps were\nremoved and MHs were washed thoroughly with deionised water to remove un-\nreacted monomers, initiator and cross-linker. Epoxy groups content was determined\nby immobilising iminodiacetic acid to epoxy groups, equilibrating MHs with 0.2 M\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of HEMA cryogels\nSample Composition for gel Swelling degree Volume of Protein concentration\npreparation ([Monomers]a\/ (g H2O\/g dried macro- by BCA assay\n[HEMA]:[PEGA]b\/[AGE]: polymerd) pores (%)e (\u00b5g\/ml hydrogel)\n[HEMA]b\/proteinc)\nHEMA 8\/6:1\/1:0\/0 17 \u00b1 0.5 89.0 \u00b1 0.8 0\nepHEMA 8\/6:1\/1:5\/0 16 \u00b1 1.0 85.0 \u00b1 1.0 0\nCG\/HEMA 8\/6:1\/1:0\/0.5 18 \u00b1 0.8 87.9 \u00b1 2.0 80\u201385\nFg\/HEMA 8\/6:1\/1:0\/0.5 16 \u00b1 1.0 88.7 \u00b1 0.9 80\u201385\nCG\u2013epHEMA 8\/6:1\/1:5\/0 16 \u00b1 1.0 85.0 \u00b1 1.0 130\u2013140\nFg\u2013epHEMA 8\/6:1\/1:5\/0 16 \u00b1 1.0 85.0 \u00b1 1.0 130\u2013140\na Total concentration of HEMA + PEGA + AGE in % (w\/v).\nb Monomer concentration in mol%.\nc Protein concentration in mg\/ml.\nd Swelling degree was estimated as ((mswollen gel \u2212 mdried gel)\/mdried gel).\ne The volume of macropores in the swollen cryogel was roughly estimated by squeezing the free\nwater from the swollen gel matrix as follows: ((mswollen gel \u2212 msqueezed gel)\/mswollen gel) \u00d7 100%.\nI.

The\nepoxy group content for epHEMA MH was 17 \u00b5mol epoxy group\/ml gel.\n2.3. Cryogel Characterisation\nThe total volume of macropores in the swollen cryogel was roughly estimated as\nfollows: the weight of the sample (msqueezed gel) was determined after squeezing\nthe free water from the swollen gel matrix, and the porosity was calculated as\nfollows: ((mswollen gel \u2212 msqueezed gel)\/mswollen gel) \u00d7 100% [39]. The measurements\nwere done in triplicate and average value was shown. The swelling degree was esti-\nmated as amount of water in swollen cryogel per gram dried polymer. The MHs was\ndried in oven at 60\u25e6C until constant weight. The swelling capacity was calculated\nas follows: ((mswollen gel \u2212 mdried gel)\/mdried gel) \u00d7 100%.\n2.4. Surface Modification via Protein Coupling to Epoxy-Containing MHs\nEpoxy-containing MHs were placed into a 96-minicolumn well plate (Nunc,\nRoskilde, Denmark), a microtitre plate with open drop-forming units at the bot-\ntom of each well. The pH of collagen and fibrinogen solutions (1 mg\/ml in 10 mM\nacetic acid and deionised water, respectively) was adjusted with 0.1 M NaOH to\n8.5\u20139.0. Epoxy\u2013pHEMA MHs were equilibrated with a protein solution by passing\n0.5 ml of the solution through each well and incubated for 24 h at room temper-\nature. Non-bound proteins were removed by washing each MH with 2 ml sterile\nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4; 0.26 g KH2PO4,1.44 g Na2HPO4 \u00b7 2H2O\nand 8.71 g NaCl per litre).\n2.5. Determination of Protein Content in Modified MHs\nThe amount of protein incorporated into MHs was determined by the bicinchoninic\nacid (BCA) method [40]. An approach optimized by Kumar et al. for direct deter-\nmination of protein on the cryogel was used [41].\n2.6. FITC Labelling of MHs\nCollagen and fibrinogen in the CG\u2013epHEMA, CG\/HEMA, Fg\u2013epHEMA and\nFg\/HEMA were labelled by covalently linking a fluorescent marker, fluoresceine\nisothiocyanate (FITC). Labelling was achieved by the following procedure: MHs\ndiscs (0.25 ml) were washed with 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 9.0), and\n20 \u00b5l FITC solution in DMSO (1 mg\/ml) was added to each disk in 1 ml of sodium\nphosphate buffer. The samples were incubated for 2 days and thoroughly washed\nwith water. A sheet of 1 mm thickness was cut from each MH and examined\nusing confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM, Leica TCS SP5, Leica, Wet-\nzlar, Germany). pHEMA and epHEMA MHs without proteins were modified with\nFITC using the same method and used as control. Prior to modification with FITC,\nepHEMA MH was incubated in a buffer solution (pH 8.5\u20139.0) for 24 h, to hydrolyse\nthe epoxy groups in a manner similar to modification with proteins. Control sam-\nples demonstrated that there was some non-specific FITC sorption to the polymer\n1786 I. N. Savina et al. \/ Journal of Biomaterials Science 20 (2009) 1781\u20131795\nmatrix, which resulted in a staining of the hydrogel matrix as well. However, this\nstaining has low intensity and could be eliminated by decreasing the intensity of the\nemitted light. All CLSM images were adjusted to represent the protein distribution\nrather than the structure of hydrogel matrix.\n2.7. Immunostaining of MHs\nHydrated CG\u2013epHEMA, CG\/pHEMA, Fg\u2013epHEMA and Fg\/HEMA plugs\n(0.25 ml) were cut with a blade into 1\u20132-mm-thick discs. Two or three disks were\nused for modification. Samples were thoroughly washed with deionised water, equi-\nlibrated with 10 mM PBS (pH 7.4) and gently dried with a cotton pad to remove\nPBS from the macropores. The discs were equilibrated and incubated with primary\nIgG (monoclonal mouse anti-collagen and anti-fibrinogen antibodies, dilution 1:50\nin PBS) for 3\u20134 h with gentle shaking at room temperature. Then the discs were\nrepeatedly washed with PBS to remove unbound IgG and gently dried with a cotton\npad. Secondary FITC-labelled IgG solution (anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific)-FITC\nantibody produced in goat, dilution 1:25 in PBS) was added to the discs. The sam-\nples were incubated overnight at room temperature, washed with PBS to remove\nunbound FITC-labelled IgG and examined with CLSM.\n2.8. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy\nThe samples were examined with a CLSM using a regular 20\u00d7 objective. Confocal\nmicroscopy was carried out as follows. A disc of approx. 1 mm in height was cut\nfrom the wet MHs. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 and 530 nm,\nrespectively. All images were generated by optical sectioning in the z-direction. For\nthis purpose, 80 optical sections were taken along with a z-distance of 80 \u00b5m.\n2.9. Maintenance of Cell Cultures\nHuman embryonic fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM media, supplemented\nwith 10% foetal bovine serum and 0.1% kanamycine monosulfate at 37\u25e6C in the\npresence of 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cells were trypsinised (0.25%\ntrypsin-EDTA) from tissue-culture plates, washed and split as they approached 80%\nconfluence every 2\u20133 days.\n2.10. Culturing of Cells on MHs\nCell seeding and culturing in MHs in a 96-minicolumn plate format are described\nin details in [4]. Briefly, MHs were inserted into the wells of a 96-minicolumn plate\nand sterilised by incubation with 70% ethanol for 2 h. After washing with sterile\nwater to remove ethanol, MHs were equilibrated and incubated with the medium for\nat least 12 h prior to cell seeding. Cell seeding was performed by applying 0.3 ml\ncell suspension (2 \u00d7 105 cells\/ml) to the top of each MH (0.25 ml). The culture\nplate was aligned on top of a 96-well collector plate, closed with a lid and placed\nin a 95% air\/5% CO2 incubator at 37\u25e6C. Growth medium was changed by applying\n0.3 ml fresh medium to each MH every 24 h. The medium displaced from MHs was\ncollected in the collector plate and analysed by dinitrosalicylic acid glucose assay.\nI. N. Savina et al. \/ Journal of Biomaterials Science 20 (2009) 1781\u20131795 1787\n2.11. Measurement of Glucose Consumption Rate\nThe sample (0.07 ml) was mixed with 0.1% 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid in 0.05 M\nNaOH containing 4% potassium sodium tartrate in a capped test tube. Total volume\nof the reaction mixture was 1.5 ml. The mixture was incubated at 95\u25e6C for 5 min to\ndevelop a red-brown colour. After cooling to room temperature on an ice bath, the\nabsorbance was recorded at 540 nm.\nGlucose consumption was calculated as:\n([glucosestart] \u2212 [glucose24 h]) \u00d7 V,\nwhere [glucosestart] is the initial concentration of glucose in the growth medium (the\nvalue given in the data sheet), [glucose24 h] is the concentration of glucose in the\neffluent (used medium) displaced from MHs during medium exchange procedure\nand V is the volume of the effluent.\n2.12. Scanning Electron Microscopy\nMHs were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2)\novernight, and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h, dehydrated in ethanol\n(30, 50, 75 and 99.5%) and critical-point-dried. The dried samples were coated\nwith gold\/palladium (40:60) and examined using a Jeol JSM-5600LV scanning mi-\ncroscope.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Biomimetic MHs Preparation, Ligand Distribution\npHEMA MH scaffolds were prepared using a cryogelation technique which pro-\nvides preparation of highly porous gels with large interconnected pores and sponge-\nlike morphology [6, 9]. Synthetic scaffolds are rendered bioactive by modification\nwith extracellular matrix ligands. Collagen and fibrinogen are the extracellular ma-\ntrix proteins which are widely used for improving cell adhesion and proliferation\non the polymer surfaces [3, 43, 44]. These two proteins were used for biocoating\nof MHs using two different strategies, i.e., surface and bulk modification. Sur-\nface modification involved preparation of MHs containing epoxy groups (epHEMA\nMH), which were then modified with the proteins. Thus, the proteins were cova-\nlently immobilised on the surface of MHs via interaction with epoxy groups present\nin the matrix (CG\u2013epHEMA and Fg\u2013epHEMA MHs) after scaffold fabrication.\nBulk modification involved adding the proteins to the reaction mixture before hy-\ndrogel formation. Thus, collagen and fibrinogen were incorporated in the polymer\nmatrix directly during the polymerisation, forming the pore walls together with\nHEMA polymer (CG\/pHEMA and Fg\/pHEMA MHs, respectively).\nEpoxy group-containing pHEMA MHs had a pore size of 5\u2013100 \u00b5m (Fig. 1).\nFg\u2013pHEMA and CG\u2013pHEMA had similar structure (the images are not presented).\nThe total volume of the macropores was 85\u201389% (Table 1). The presence of pro-\ntein in the reaction media did not affect the porous structure of CG\/pHEMA and\n1788 I. N. Savina et al. \/ Journal of Biomaterials Science 20 (2009) 1781\u20131795\nFigure 1.

The amount of protein in MHs obtained by di-\nrect monomer cryo-co-polymerisation with the protein present in solution and in\npHEMA MHs containing proteins coupled via epoxy groups was 80\u201385 and 130\u2013\n140 \u00b5g\/ml hydrated cryogel, respectively (Table 1). It is noteworthy that MHs used\nfor protein assay were thoroughly washed with ethanol and water prior to the analy-\nsis in the same way as those MHs which were used in cell-culture experiments.\nSpatial distribution of proteins in FITC-labelled MHs was studied using CLSM.\nThe protein distribution during surface modification could depend on the reactiv-\nity and distribution of the functional (epoxy) groups available for modification, as\nwell as on protein solubility in the reaction medium and its interaction with the\nfunctional groups. As the same epoxy-containing matrix has been used for mod-\nification with two different proteins, the main factor leading to the difference in\nprotein conformation and density on the pore wall surface of epHEMA MHs is,\ntherefore, the protein solubility in the reaction medium and its interaction with the\nreactive groups. In bulk modification protein distribution depends on the miscibility\n(compatibility) of protein with a monomer\/polymer solution. One can expect that,\nwhen introduced during the gel formation, the protein will build up the gel walls\ntogether with the polymer. Such incorporation could take place partially due to in-\nvolvement of proteins in chain termination during free radical co-polymerisation\nand by physical entrapment during the formation of polymeric network.\nSpatial distribution of collagen and fibrinogen in MH matrix varied in different\ntypes of MHs depending on the nature of the protein and the method used for gel\nmodification (Fig. 2). Collagen attached to pHEMA MH surface through epoxy\ngroups had a spot-like discrete distribution in the hydrogel (Fig. 2a), whereas fib-\nrinogen was spread out evenly on the MH surface (Fig. 2b). In contrast, when the\nproteins were incorporated in the MHs by bulk modification, collagen was evenly\ndistributed in the MHs matrix (Fig. 2c), whereas fibrinogen appeared in the form of\nseparated spots or aggregates distributed along the gel matrix (Fig. 2d).\nI. N. Savina et al. \/ Journal of Biomaterials Science 20 (2009) 1781\u20131795 1789\nFigure 2. CLSM images of spatial distribution of collagen and fibrinogen on the surface-modified\n(a, CG\u2013epHEMA; b, Fg\u2013epHEMA) and bulk-modified (c, CG\/pHEMA; d, Fg\/pHEMA) MHs. The\nsamples were labelled with FITC (see Materials and Methods). This figure is published in colour in\nthe online edition that can be accessed via http:\/\/www.brill.nl\/jbs\nSuch a different behaviour of collagen and fibrinogen could be caused by a com-\nbination of the following factors: solubility of the protein in the reaction medium\nand its interaction with the surface in the case of surface modification and by solu-\nbility\/compatibility of proteins with HEMA solution, when protein was introduced\nby bulk modification. Human plasma fibrinogen (340 kDa) is a very hydrophilic\nprotein which consists of three different chains arranged in a dimer, (A\u03b1, B\u03b2 , \u03b3 )2,\nand has a pI of 5.8 [45\u201347]. The electrical charge and hydrophobicity of bioma-\nterial surfaces influence fibrinogen structure. Fibrinogen molecules spread out on\nhydrophobic and positively charged surfaces, as opposed to hydrophilic and nega-\ntively charged surfaces [48].\nThe fundamental structural unit of collagen is a long (300 nm) and thin (1.5 nm\ndiameter) molecule that consists of three coiled subunits. The isoelectric point of\ncollagen is near 10 [49]. Thus, basic conditions (pH 9.0) used for surface modifi-\ncation of epHEMA MHs enhanced solubility of fibrinogen, while collagen, which\nhas poor solubility in aqueous solutions, especially at high pH, was partially in the\naggregated form. This resulted in spot-like distribution of collagen aggregates on\nthe surface, while fibrinogen was completely solubilised at pH 9.0, spread out on\nepHEMA surface evenly without forming aggregates.\nOn the other hand, during bulk modification the behaviour of protein in the re-\naction medium could be different due to differences in compatibility of proteins\n1790 I. N. Savina et al. \/ Journal of Biomaterials Science 20 (2009) 1781\u20131795\nwith HEMA monomer and HEMA polymer formed. Apparently, compatibility of\ncollagen with HEMA was better and it was uniformly distributed in the polymer\nsolution building into polymer walls of MHs (Fig. 2c). The spot-like distribution\nof fibrinogen molecules in the bulk of the MHs matrix could be a result of poor\ncompatibility of fibrinogen with HEMA solution (Fig. 2d). Moreover, the pH of\nthe reaction mixture used for cryo-polymerisation was close to or lower than the\npI of fibrinogen, decreasing its solubility. Thus, fibrinogen was embedded in an\naggregated form during MH production.\n3.2. Immunostaining of MHs\nThe biomolecules should retain biological activity and be accessible to interactions\nwith cells. To maintain their activity, immobilised proteins should be flexible, ex-\nperience minimal steric hindrance and have intact recognition sites available for\ninteraction with cells. It is essential to consider the surface chemistry of synthetic\nmaterials in relation to the biological function of the attached biomimetic ligand.\nThe mobility and accessibility of the ligand strongly influence the cell attachment\nand proliferation [31].\nImmunostaining with monoclonal anti-collagen and anti-fibrinogen antibodies\nwas used to indentify the native form of collagen and fibrinogen on the sur-\nface of MHs. After labelling with monoclonal anti-collagen and monoclonal anti-\nfibrinogen antibodies, MHs were labelled with secondary antibodies conjugated\nwith FITC. Unlike staining with FITC, a small molecule (389 Da) which interacts\nwith nucleophilic functional groups of protein molecules immobilised both on the\nsurface and in the bulk of MH, regardless of their conformation, immunostaining\ntargets only surface bound proteins which retain the native conformation. MHs pro-\nduced by cryotropic polymerization have thick, non-porous polymer walls [39] and\nsuch large molecules as IgG (150 kDa) cannot access protein molecules distributed\nin polymer matrix of the pore walls.\nThe pattern of protein distribution in modified MHs revealed by immunostaining\nwas similar to the one provided by staining with FITC, demonstrating that proteins\nretained native binding sites after modification. The spot-like distribution of colla-\ngen in CG\u2013epHEMA and fibrinogen in Fg\/pHEMA (Fig. 3a and 3d) and more even\nspreading of the proteins along the polymer matrix on the surface in Fg\u2013epHEMA\nand CG\u2013pHEMA (Fig. 3b and 3c) was observed. However, not all of the protein in-\ntroduced in MH by bulk modification and detected by FITC staining was observed\nby CLSM after immunostaining (Figs 2 and 3). Most of the protein was \u2018buried\u2019\nin the polymer matrix and was not accessible for interaction with the antibodies.\nFrom the immunostaining images, the amount of fibrinogen accessible on the sur-\nface appeared to be larger than that of collagen. Fibrinogen introduced in MHs by\nsurface modification was evenly distributed on the polymer surface and retained its\nnative structure with most of the sites available for interactions with the antibodies\n(Fig. 3b).\nI. N. Savina et al. \/ Journal of Biomaterials Science 20 (2009) 1781\u20131795 1791\nFigure 3. CLSM images of spatial distribution of collagen and fibrinogen on the surface-modified\n(a, CG\u2013epHEMA; b, Fg\u2013epHEMA) and bulk-modified (c, CG\/pHEMA; d, FG\/pHEMA) MHs. Sam-\nples were immunostained with FITC-labelled monoclonal anti-collagen monoclonal anti-fibrinogen\nmouse antibody and with secondary anti-mouse antibody (see Materials and Methods). This figure is\npublished in colour in the online edition that can be accessed via http:\/\/www.brill.nl\/jbs\n3.3. Cell Culturing\nThe glucose consumption rate, GCR, by a cell culture can be applied as an indirect\nmethod to monitor the cell activity in a bioreactor [50]. This method was applied in\nthe present study to estimate the viable cell numbers in MHs. GCRs of fibroblasts\nwere measured at 10, 15 and 25 days post-seeding. After the first 10 days of culture\nthe highest GCR was on Fg\u2013epHEMA MHs following the trend Fg\u2013epHEMA >\nFg\/pHEMA \u0002 CG\u2013epHEMA \u0002 CG\/pHEMA \u0002 pHEMA (Fig. 4). In unmodified\nMHs GCR was low and remained practically the same at all measured time points.\nPractically no cells were observed in the effluents (medium displaced from MHs by\naddition of fresh medium) during the procedure of medium refreshment, indicating\nthat cells adhered to all types of MHs.\nFigure 5 demonstrates scanning electron micrographs of fibroblasts cultured on\ndifferent types of MHs for 30 days. Cells and abundantly secreted extracellular ma-\ntrix (ECM) fill the pore space of Fg\u2013epHEMA and CG\/pHEMA forming tissue-like\nstructures. The monolayer formed on CG\u2013epHEMA MH had a different morphol-\nogy and was more compact than the structures formed on Fg\u2013epHEMA. Separate\ncells are not seen in the layers formed on Fg\u2013epHEMA presumably due to the flat-\n1792 I. N. Savina et al. \/ Journal of Biomaterials Science 20 (2009) 1781\u20131795\nFigure 4. Glucose consumption per 24 h by fibroblasts cultured for 10 days in MHs (0.25 ml) of\ndifferent types. The growth medium was changed by applying 0.3 ml of fresh medium to each MH\nevery 24 h. Glucose concentration was determined by dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method. Glucose\nconsumption was calculated as: ([glucose]start \u2212 [glucose]24 h)\u00d7volume. Each test was performed in\ntriplicate.\ntened morphology and coverage with ECM secreted by the cells. It is important\nto note that only plain pHEMA MHs were not completely covered with cells after\n1 month of culturing.\nIn general, infiltration of the scaffold by cells was more efficient on MHs with\nan even protein distribution. Proteins immobilised on these MHs presumably had\nmore recognition sites available for interaction with cells than the proteins in MHs\nwith a spot-like ligand distribution in which they were incorporated in a par-\ntially aggregated state. Therefore, cells grew faster on Fg\u2013epHEMA MHs than on\nFg\/pHEMA (Fig. 4). A faster cell growth observed on Fg-treated MHs than the\none on CG-treated MHs was probably due to the aggregated protein conformation\nin CG\u2013epHEMA MHs and to lower protein content (80\u201385 \u00b5g\/ml) in CG\/pHEMA\nMHs than in Fg\u2013epHEMA (130\u2013140 \u00b5g\/ml). Also, the amount of fibrinogen ac-\ncessible on the surface of MHs appeared to be larger than that of collagen as was\ndemonstrated by the immunostaining analysis.\n4. Conclusions\nAnalysis of HEMA MHs modified with collagen and fibrinogen demonstrated sig-\nnificant variations in spatial distribution and surface density of the incorporated\nproteins, which depend on protein nature and method used for modification. Bulk\nmodification resulted in uniform collagen distribution in the polymer matrix and\nI. N. Savina et al. \/ Journal of Biomaterials Science 20 (2009) 1781\u20131795 1793\nFigure 5.

In contrast, surface modification resulted in\nspot-like distribution of collagen and spreading out of fibrinogen, which evenly\ncoated the surface. Surface-modified MHs had more protein present on the surface\nand available for interaction with cells than in case of bulk modification of MHs, in\nwhich most of the immobilised protein was distributed in the polymer matrix and\ninaccessible for cell interaction. Surface modification with fibrinogen produced an\neven coating of the surface with the protein retaining its natural conformation. It\nexplains the best performance of Fg\u2013epHEMA MHs in cell culturing.\n1794 I. N. Savina et al. \/ Journal of Biomaterials Science 20 (2009) 1781\u20131795\nThe coupling chemistry is also an important parameter in designing biomimetic\nMHs as it has major effect on the spatial distribution and density of the ligand in\nthe polymer matrix, which, in turn, influence cell\u2013scaffold interactions.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was financially supported by Protista Biotechnology AB (Bjuv, Sweden),\nSwedish Research Council (project 621-2007-36-24), FP6 project MTKI-CT-2006-\n042768-MATISS, FP7 project (PIAP-GA-2008-218242) and the Royal Society (In-\nternational Incoming Short Visit 2007\/R3).\nReferences\n1.
