In Ellsberg\u2019s simplest illustration of it, two urns are \nfilled with red and black balls, Urn A containing 50 red and 50 black balls, randomly \nmixed, and Urn B containing an unknown ratio of 100 red and black balls, randomly \nmixed. A decision maker chooses a colour (red or black) and an urn (A or B) from \nwhich to make a blind drawing and wins a prize if a ball of the chosen colour is drawn. \nA large majority of decision makers strictly prefer the known-risk Urn A to the  \n \n \nAddress for correspondence: Briony D.

Ambiguity aversion has also \nbeen found in many applied contexts, such as insurance decisions (Einhorn & Hogarth, \n1985, 1986), environmental risk (Viscusi, Magat, & Huber, 1991), and medical \ndecisions (Ritov & Baron, 1990; Bier & Connell, 1994).  \nAmbiguity aversion has been examined from both cognitive and motivational \nperspectives (for a discussion, see Rode, Cosmides, Hell, & Tooby, 1999). Researchers \ntaking the cognitive perspective have produced evidence that ambiguity influences \nperceptions of likelihood or risk. Einhorn and Hogarth (1985) argued that when people \nare given a probability that they believe is ambiguous, they use it as an anchor and then \nadjust it upwards or downwards, and one important factor in this adjustment is whether \nthey are pessimistic or optimistic about the outcome. However, \u201cthe motivational \napproach assumes that people avoid ambiguity in order to satisfy secondary \nmotivational factors that arise from the relative lack of information about the ambiguous \noption\u201d (K\u00fchberger & Perner, 2003, p. 182). The motivational explanations imply that \ndecision makers prefer to obtain more information or choose the option about which \nthey are best informed, all other things being equal (Baron & Frisch, 1994).  \nWhile the majority of people are ambiguity averse when faced with unknown \nprobabilities, some individuals are less ambiguity averse than the rest. Individual \ndifferences have been incorporated into theoretical models of ambiguity aversion \n(Einhorn & Hogarth, 1985; Kahn & Sarin, 1988), because consistent individual \ndifferences in ambiguity aversion have been demonstrated. Personality correlates of \nambiguity aversion that have been investigated include optimism (Bier & Connell, \n1994), attitudes towards risk (Lauriola & Levin, 2001) and fear of negative evaluation \n(Trautmann & Vieider, 2007).  \nSince optimism and pessimism are defined as positive and negative outcome \nexpectancies, it would seem logical that people with a predisposition to expecting things \nto turn out well might perceive an ambiguous situation differently from someone who \ntends to expect the worst to happen. Some empirical research on optimism and \nambiguity aversion has been carried out by Bier and Connell (1994), who investigated \nthe sources of ambiguity aversion by studying optimism (measured with the Life \nOrientation Test, LOT; Scheier & Carver, 1985), anxiety, mood, need for cognitive \nstructure and locus of control. The LOT is a unidimensional measure of the construct of \noptimism\u2013pessimism, and Bier and Connell split the scores to form three groups that \nthey called optimists, moderates, and pessimists. Their hypothesis originated from \nCurley, Eraker, and Yates\u2019s (1984) observation that ambiguity avoiders tend to believe \nthat their actual chances of success are worse in the ambiguous situation, which \nsuggests a link with optimism\/pessimism. Bier and Connell found ambiguity seeking for \nmoderate and optimistic participants with scenarios that were positively framed in terms \nof gains, but no effect with ones that were negatively framed as losses. This finding \ngoes against the majority of earlier results reporting the reverse (e.g., Einhorn & \nHogarth, 1986; Kahn & Sarin 1988). The most likely explanation, they proposed, is the \nnature of the scenarios that they used, which had many attributes to consider and may \nhave made the information about ambiguity less salient. \nEinhorn and Hogarth (1985) also speculated that optimism and pessimism may \ninfluence ambiguity aversion, and they proposed a model in which individual \ndifferences would affect the second of their factors \u2013 the differential weighting of \nimagined probabilities.  Optimism and pessimism may alter the weights placed on the \nbest and worst outcomes. Bier and Connell similarly proposed that \u201cpositive framing \nmay have caused optimistic subjects to regard the true probability as closer to the \nfavorable end of the ambiguous range\u201d (p. 179), and they concluded by recommending \nthat their findings should be tested in the more traditional ball-and-urn setting where \nIs Luck on My Side?      3 \nambiguity is more salient. This article aims to do just that. \nRecent publications in the optimism literature have criticised the validity of the \nLOT, which Bier and Connell (1994) used, and have argued that optimism\u2013pessimism \nare not polar opposites on a unidimensional continuum (Chang, Maydeu-Olivares, & \nD\u201fZurilla, 1997). The prevailing view is now that optimism and pessimism are separate \nbut related constructs. The Extended Life Orientation Test (ELOT, developed by \nChang, et al.), is therefore used to measure both optimism and pessimism, viewing them \nas separate constructs.   \nThe present investigation focuses on whether optimism and pessimism measured \nvia the ELOT influence ambiguity aversion in a simple lottery like Ellsberg\u201fs urns. It \nwas expected that participants would tend to be more ambiguity averse than ambiguity \nseeking, but that optimism and pessimism would be associated with the degree of \nambiguity aversion. Bier and Connell (1994) found ambiguity seeking for the most \noptimistic participants in positively framed multi-attribute scenarios, leading to the first \nhypothesis in this experiment with the classic urns task, that participants with higher \noptimism scores will be more ambiguity seeking than participants with lower optimism. \nWhether lower pessimism also leads to more ambiguity seeking is also evaluated.  \nTo throw more light on the reasons for ambiguity aversion, the role of perceived \ncompetition is also investigated, since research has shown that if people view a situation \nas competitive \u2013 for example, if an experimenter or an opponent has determined the \nnumber of blue balls in the ambiguous urn \u2013 then they tend to be more ambiguity averse \n(K\u00fchberger & Perner, 2003).  K\u00fchberger and Perner place ambiguity aversion in a \ngame-theoretic context, and propose that people\u201fs attitudes toward ambiguity in the \nEllsberg urns task depends upon the perceived competitiveness of the situation, because \n\u201cpeople treat the person responsible for composing the box as another player who has \neither a cooperative or a competitive interest in the outcome of the gamble\u201d (p. 182). \nRecent research has shown that ambiguity aversion also occurs in dyadic decision \nmaking with another player (Pulford & Colman, 2007), as well as in the traditionally \nstudied individual decision-making situation. \nK\u00fchberger and Perner\u201fs (2003) results suggest that some people may interpret the \nEllsberg urns task as a competition against a knowledgeable opponent, and that this \nassumption can be reversed, and ambiguity aversion turned to ambiguity seeking, when \npeople believe they are playing with a cooperative and knowledgeable friend. Their \nhypothesis followed on from the \u201chostile nature\u201d hypothesis that people are ambiguity \naverse because they are suspicious that they are facing a biased\/rigged ambiguous urn or \nbox (Frisch & Baron, 1988; Yates & Zukowski, 1975). Frisch and Baron argued that \nambiguity aversion arises from generalizing a heuristic to avoid placing bets when one \nlacks information that others might have; for example if we think that there is a hostile \nopponent who will bias the situation to our disadvantage. In order to empirically \ninvestigate whether participants are indeed suspicious, the participants in this study are \nasked about their perceptions of the situation, for example, whether the urn is rigged or \nthe experimenter untrustworthy. Participants\u201f perceptions may turn out to relate to their \ndegree of optimism and this may help to explain why optimism influences ambiguity \naversion. \nIn this experiment, a within-subjects design is employed to control for other \nindividual differences influencing choices in the different conditions. Instructions to \nparticipants are manipulated in two conditions, to alter the perceived likelihood that the \nambiguous urn has been \u201erigged\u201f by the experimenter.  In Condition 1 the information \ngiven specifies that the number of blue balls in the ambiguous urn was randomly \ndetermined by selecting a number out of a hat and that every possible mixture of blue \nand red balls is equally likely. This instruction should cause the participants to view the \nIs Luck on My Side?      4 \ntask in a non-competitive manner. Condition 2 is designed to remove the details of how \nthe proportion of balls in the ambiguous urn was determined, thus leaving room for \ncompetitive interpretations of the situation. The second hypothesis is that the pattern of \nambiguity aversion between conditions will be influenced by the optimism or \npessimism of the participants. Optimism or pessimism may influence people\u201fs \nperceptions of how competitive the situation is and how likely it is that the experiment \nhas been rigged for or against them. \nMethod \nParticipants \nA sample of 112 British undergraduate students (75 women and 37 men) \nvolunteered as part of a course requirement, (mean age 19.33 years, SD = 1.96, range 18 \nto 37 years).  \nMaterials \nParticipants completed the Extended Life Orientation Test (ELOT; Chang, \nMaydeu-Olivares and D\u2019Zurilla, 1997), a 20\u2013item scale containing six optimism items \nand nine pessimism items. The optimism and pessimism scales show adequate internal \nconsistency (Cronbach\u2019s alphas of .77 and .89) and 6-week retest reliability statistics \n(.73 and .84). Chang et al. report that the mean optimism score for college students was \n21.73 (SD = 3.69), and 22.51 (SD = 6.57) for pessimism, and no significant gender \ndifferences were found.  \nDesign and procedure \nThe dependent variable was the urn chosen. The experiment used a classic forced-\nchoice Ellsberg urns task, where one urn is ambiguous as to the proportion of balls \ninside it and the other is not. In Condition 1, the participants were given the following \ninformation: \n \nConsider the following problem carefully, then write down your choice. \nImagine that there are two urns, labelled A and B, containing blue and red \nmarbles, and you have to draw a marble from one of the urns without looking. If \nyou get a blue marble, you will be entered into a lottery draw with a cash prize. \nUrn A contains 50 blue marbles and 50 red marbles. Urn B contains 100 \nmarbles in an unknown colour ratio, from 100 blue marbles and 0 red marbles to \n0 blue marbles and 100 red marbles. The mixture of blue and red marbles in Urn \nB has been decided by writing the numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., 100 on separate slips of \npaper, shuffling the slips thoroughly, and then drawing one of them at random. \nThe number chosen was used to determine the number of blue marbles to be put \ninto Urn B, but you do not know the number. Every possible mixture of blue and \nred marbles in Urn B is equally likely. \nYou have to decide whether you prefer to draw a marble at random from Urn \nA or Urn B.

Every possible mixture of blue and red marbles in Urn B is \nIs Luck on My Side?      5 \nequally likely\u201d. \nTesting took place online. The options Urn A\/Urn B were counterbalanced, as \nwas the order of completing the two conditions. The two conditions were separated by a \nfiller task that took 15 minutes. Participants completed the ELOT approximately two \nmonths prior to the main study. Upon completion of the questionnaires, the participants \nwere thanked and debriefed. \nResults \nChoice \nIn Condition 1, when information was given, 82 of the 112 participants chose the \nknown-risk urn (73%), and only 30 chose the ambiguous urn (27%), clearly showing \nthat ambiguity aversion is present, \u03c72 (1, N = 112) = 24.143, p < .001. Slightly higher \nand significant ambiguity aversion was found in Condition 2 when the random-selection \ninformation was removed; 88 participants chose the known-risk urn (79%), and 24 \nchose the ambiguous urn (21%), \u03c72 (1, N = 112) = 36.571, p < .001. \nThe known-risk urn was consistently chosen in both conditions by 64% of \nparticipants, while 13% chose the ambiguous urn in both, and 23% changed their choice \nof urn between conditions. Condition order did not significantly influence choice. \n \nOptimism and Pessimism \nIn this sample, the reliability of the ELOT was \u03b1 = .73 for optimism, and \u03b1 = .87 \nfor pessimism. Mean optimism was 20.85 (SD = 3.40), and pessimism was 23.29 (SD = \n6.30), similar to that found by Chang et al. (1997). Optimism and pessimism correlated \nnegatively, r(110) = -.58, p < .001. Participants were divided into three groups \naccording to their optimism and pessimism scores, using \u00b1 0.75 of a standard deviation \nas cut off points.  \n \nTable 1 \nChoices of ambiguous and known-risk urns, for different levels of optimism when \ndifferent information was given about how the ambiguous urn was determined \n  1: Information given  \nabout random selection \n 2: No information given \nOptimism \n  \nKnown-\nrisk urn \nAmbiguous \nurn \n Known-\nrisk urn \nAmbiguous \nurn \nLow Count 22 3  21 4 \n % within group 88.0% 12.0%  84.0% 16.0% \nMedium Count 43 16  49 10 \n % within group 72.9% 27.1%  83.1% 16.9% \nHigh Count 17 11  18 10 \n % within group 60.7% 39.3%  64.3% 35.7% \nTotal Count 82 30  88 24 \n % within group 73.2% 26.8%  78.6% 21.4% \n \nTable 1 shows how the choice of ambiguous or known-risk urn in the two \nconditions was influenced by the optimism level of the participants.

Thus, there is support for the hypothesis that participants with \nhigher optimism scores are less ambiguity averse\n1\n. \nAnalyses showed that the choice of urn was not related to pessimism (see Table \n2) in either Condition 1 or 2. Significant ambiguity aversion occurred irrespective of the \nlevel of pessimism (p < .05). \n \nPerceptions of the situation \n The participants\u201f perceptions of the situations were analysed using Kruskal-\nWallis tests for nonparametric data with three independent groups. Table 3 shows that \nthe three optimism groups did not differ in their perception that the ambiguous urn may \nbe rigged, either in Condition 1, H(2, N = 112) = 0.014, p = .99, or in Condition 2, H(2, \nN = 112) = 0.919, p = .63. All three groups, however, tended to significantly perceive \nthat urn B was more likely to be rigged against them in Condition 2 (M = 3.33) than in \nCondition 1 (M = 2.84; all p < .05).  \nAll three optimism groups trusted the experimenter similarly in Condition 1 when \nthe information about random selection was given, H(2, N = 112) = 1.733,  p = .42, ns. \nIn Condition 2, however, the low-optimism group were significantly less trusting of the \nexperimenter than the most optimistic participants, H(2, N = 112) = 7.893, p = .02. This \nwas due to the finding that while the low- and medium-optimism groups were \nsignificantly less trusting of the experimenter in Condition 2 than in Condition 1 \n(Wilcoxon T = 2.52, p = .01 and T = 2.88, p = .004, respectively), the highly optimistic \ngroup trusted the experimenter similarly in both conditions, T = 1.41, p = .16, ns. \nPessimism was found to have no discernible pattern of influence on the ratings in either \ncondition, except that highly pessimistic participants trusted the experimenter \nsignificantly less than the medium-pessimism participants in both conditions.  \nExamining Table 3 further reveals that in Condition 1 people who chose the \nambiguous urn (n = 30) did not differ in their perceptions of the situation from those \npeople who chose the known-risk urn (n = 82). Participants\u201f perceptions in Condition 2, \nhowever, were different as those people who chose the known-risk urn (n = 88) tended \nto believe that Urn B was much more likely to be rigged than did those people who \nchose the ambiguous urn B (n = 24), U = 721, p = .01, and they were slightly less \ntrusting of the experimenter, U = 836, p = .09. \n \nDiscussion \nIn Condition 1, it was explicit that the number of blue marbles in the ambiguous \nurn had been randomly chosen, and participants viewed the situation similarly, \nregardless of optimism, tending to believe that the urn was not rigged against them and \nthat they trusted the experimenter. Their choices in Condition 1, however, were \nradically different, with the vast majority of low-optimism participants (88%) choosing \nthe know-risk urn, and thus being very ambiguity averse, while the highly optimistic \nparticipants were relatively indifferent in their choice of urn, showing little if any \nambiguity aversion. The first hypothesis was thus supported by the results. Clearly the \nambiguous urn is far less threatening to optimistic participants than it is to the less \noptimistic ones. This result confirms Bier and Connell\u2019s (1994) finding that higher \noptimism is associated with less ambiguity aversion. Bier and Connell found this with \nmedical scenarios, and this experiment shows that it also occurs in the traditional \nEllsberg urns task where ambiguity is more obvious. Pessimism had no influence on \neither ambiguity aversion or perceptions of the situation. By measuring optimism and \npessimism as separate constructs in this experiment it has become apparent that it is the \nIs Luck on My Side?      8 \npresence of optimism and not the absence of pessimism that reduces ambiguity \naversion.  \nIn Condition 1, the experimenter could not have rigged the urn and was not \nperceived to have done so. Why then were the people who lack optimism so extremely \nambiguity averse? The \u201ehostile nature\u201f or \u201ecompetitive other\u201f theories do not seem \ncapable of explaining these differences in Condition 1. These results do not contradict \nEinhorn and Hogarth\u201fs (1985) proposal that optimism and pessimism may alter \nperceived probabilities, but they do suggest that it is the least optimistic people who are \nthe most likely to adjust perceived probabilities in the ambiguous urn to make them less \nlikely to win and thus are most ambiguity averse. \nIn Condition 1, the high optimists were more than three times as likely to choose \nthe ambiguous urn than people who were low in optimism, and they were twice as \nlikely to in Condition 2. Fewer medium-optimism participants chose the ambiguous \noption in Condition 2 than Condition 1, and this indicates that the absence of the \ninformation about how the ambiguous urn was to be filled made some of these people \nmore ambiguity averse and behave like the low-optimism group. Highly optimistic \npeople tended to trust the experimenter in both conditions and thus were not much more \nambiguity averse in Condition 2. When the random-selection information was missing \n(in Condition 2)  the situation was construed as potentially more competitive, as \nK\u00fchberger and Perner (2003) proposed, as evidenced by their changed ratings of how \nlikely it was that the urn was rigged and how much they trusted the experimenter. These \nperceptions of the social situation do appear to influence how people perceive the odds \nin the ambiguous urn and thus also influence ambiguity aversion. Pessimism appears to \nbe of lesser importance than optimism in these social judgements.  \nThis experiment shows that optimism is associated with far less ambiguity \naversion. Many of the optimists must have judged  the probability of winning to be \ngreater in the ambiguous urn than in the known-risk one. The more optimistic \nparticipants seem to be optimistic about the random nature of luck, perhaps having a \nbelief in being lucky, or of having some personal control over the odds, although this is \nadmittedly conjectural. Perhaps the judgement people make is not about how many \nwinning balls there are in the urns but about how such situations usually turn out for \nthem. By definition, people who are optimistic believe that things will turn out for the \nbest, and events will go their way in the future, and thus they are indifferent between the \ntwo urns. People who are not optimistic, however, believe that things generally turn out \nbadly for them and do not result in favourable outcomes; thus they may be more wary \nof any situation where odds may be stacked against them (by people or by chance), and \nthus they prefer known-risk 50:50 odds. Alternatively, optimism also correlates highly \nwith self-esteem, and thus perhaps optimists can tolerate losing after drawing from an \nambiguous urn, whereas someone with lower self-esteem and less optimism would feel \nmore upset by a loss after choosing that urn. Anticipating these feelings may influence \nchoices. Future research should investigate this possibility. Future researchers, using the \ntwo-colour Ellsberg Urns task, with a specified target colour to be drawn, should also \nconsider the issue of trust in the experimenter not to rig the urn, as this needs \ncontrolling for if pure ambiguity aversion is to be measured.  \nIn conclusion, highly optimistic people appear to feel that luck may be on their \nside, even when a potential competitor is involved, or perhaps feel optimistic that the \nexperimenter is not a competitor and is trustworthy. People lacking high optimism, \nhowever, shy away from choosing ambiguous options, even when the situation is \nclearly not rigged against them by the experimenter. \nIs Luck on My Side?      9 \nReferences \nBaron, J., & Frisch, D.
