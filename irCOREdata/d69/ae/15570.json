The\nprocess involves trying to artfully work out how disparate\ntechnologies integrate with existing and evolving patterns of work\nwithin developing regulatory requirements. We conclude by\nsuggesting ways in which ethnographic interventions and user\ninvolvement may be timed and targeted to aid in achieving this\nprocess.<\/dc:description><dc:description>This paper was originally presented at th ACM SIGGROUP conference on Supporting group work, 2005, Sanibel Island, Florida, USA.<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>ACM Press<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-14T16:27:09Z<\/dc:date><dc:type>Article<\/dc:type><dc:format>YES<\/dc:format><dc:identifier>Proceedings of the 2005 international ACM SIGGROUP conference on Supporting group work, pp. 313-322<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1595932232<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1145\/1099203.1099256<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2173\/8413<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:relation>http:\/\/delivery.acm.org\/10.1145\/1100000\/1099256\/p313-martin.pdf?key1=1099256&key2=3899641711&coll=portal&dl=ACM&CFID=15151515&CFTOKEN=6184618<\/dc:relation><\/oai_dc:dc><\/metadata><\/record>","journals":null,"language":null,"relations":["http:\/\/delivery.acm.org\/10.1145\/1100000\/1099256\/p313-martin.pdf?key1=1099256&key2=3899641711&coll=portal&dl=ACM&CFID=15151515&CFTOKEN=6184618"],"year":2007,"topics":["Integration","Electronic patient records","Healthcare","COTS systems","Ethnography","Ethnomethodology","Configuration"],"subject":["Article"],"fullText":null}
