Please cite the \npublished version. \n \nNineteenth-Century Popular Science Magazines, Narrative, and the \nProblem of Historical Materiality \n \nThis is precisely the vindication of the popular lecture as an educative and \ninstructive agency.  So many of us are like children; we like to be \u201ctold a story\u201d, and \nthe telling of the story excites in us a desire to know more.  (Wilson, 1898, p. 95) \n \nIn his Reminiscences of a Lecturer, Andrew Wilson emphasizes the importance of \nnarrative to popular science lecturing.  Although Wilson promotes the teaching of \nscience as useful knowledge in its own right, he also recognizes that the way science \nis taught can encourage audiences to take the subject up and read further on their \nown.  Form, according to Wilson, should not be divorced from scientific content and \nlecturers should ensure that not only is their science accurate, but that it is presented \nin a way that will provoke curiousity and stimulate interest.  In this paper I discuss \nthe influence of narrative in structuring scientific objects and phenomena, and \nconsider the consequences of such presentations for historical research.  As \nscientific journalism necessarily weaves both its intended audience and the objects \nunder discussion into its accounts, these texts, I argue, demand that we recognize \ntheir nature as social relationships inscribed in historical objects. \n \n*  *  * \n \nAndrew Wilson\u2019s emphasis on form is important because, like many late nineteenth-\ncentury scientists, he depended upon the press for a large portion of his income.  \nAlthough there was money to be made writing for the diffuse scientific community \nin nineteenth-century Britain, science was acknowledged as an important component \nof wider culture and so something that should be reported within non-scientific \ntitles.  Consequently, writers like Wilson had to bear in mind both the scientific \nliteracy of their intended audiences, and the wider concerns of the title to which they \nsubmitted content.  Wilson himself contributed a weekly column to the Illustrated \nLondon News called \u201cScience Jottings.\u201d  Although the Illustrated London News was \nostensibly a newspaper, its weekly periodicity positioned it somewhere between the \nnewspaper and the magazine.  This was reflected in its content: although news \n  \n2\noccupied the first few pages of each number, many of its columns were devoted to \nregular features, literary pieces, and social commentary.  Wilson\u2019s \u201cScience \nJottings\u201d are part of this magazine-type content: they rarely address the scientific \nnews stories of the day; instead, each takes a single scientific subject and relates it in \na conversational manner that leads from the specific and everday to the technical \nand abstract.  This genre of journalism, therefore, is similar to the popular lecture \nand Wilson, like many of his colleagues, combined his literary production with his \nlecturing, publishing lectures as articles, and memorializing both as books (Wilson, \n1887).  \n \nThere was a political component to such journalism in the late nineteenth century.  \nH.G. Wells began his career as an author by contributing articles on science to a \nwide range of periodicals (Hughes and Philmus 1973).  In an article published in \nNature in 1894, Wells discusses the importance of such writing to science: \nThe fact remains that in an age when the endowment of research is rapidly \npassing out of the hands of private or quasi-private organizations into the \nhands of the State, the maintenance of an intelligent exterior interest in \nrecent investigation becomes of almost vital importance to continued \nprogress (Wells 1894, p. 300; Lancashire 1988). \nThe state endowment of scientific research was controversial in late nineteenth-\ncentury Britain as many argued that it would compromise disinterested research.  \nHowever, the editor of Nature, Joseph Norman Lockyer, was a vocal supporter of \nstate-endowment, and he used the journal to campaign for increased funding for \nscience.  In \u201cPopularising Science\u201d, Wells insists that the professional model sought \nby the elite scientists clustered around Nature could only be maintained if the \nprofession was recognized and approved by the wider public beyond its readers.  \nThis role, he suggests, should be undertaken by those best qualified to do so \u2013 \nspecifically scientifically trained writers such as himself.  Railing against current \npublications for their want of what he calls \u201cphilosophical quality\u201d and their often \nmiscellaneous subject matter, Wells offers advice to the aspirant scientific writer in \nan attempt to ensure only the \u201cright\u201d science would be communicated (Wells 1894, \np. 300).  His article, therefore, is part of a wider imperialist attempt to dictate the \nactual nature of things through a discourse which derives from, whilst \nsimultaneously re-affirming, an institutionalized, professionalizing elite.  However, \n  \n3\nas science becomes more specialized, it necessarily becomes more difficult for those  \noutside its codes to understand: Wells therefore must provide a model for science \ncommunication that accommodates such discursive boundaries, while ensuring that \nhis audience are not alienated from the subject matter they exist to define. \n \nScientific objects and phenomena are notoriously hard to detect and, paradoxically,  \noften become more mediated as scientists attempt to get closer to them.  The whole \npanoply of laboratory, equipment, and experiment is designed to provide a stage \nupon which as yet unknown things can happen in a quantifiable and repeatable \nmanner.  Because viruses, radioactivity, chemical reactions, and many other now \nfamiliar phenomena are not immediately self-evident, at one stage in their histories \nthey simply did not exist in the human world.  Of course the actions of these various \nthings did exist, but the objects which are now claimed as their causes did not.  \nBruno Latour, following the things from the lab to the page, claims that science \ndraws its power and constructs its objectivity through a rhetoric that leads the reader \nback to these objects (Latour 1987; 1999).  Suspected objects become more solid as \nscientists mobilize evidence that points to their existence beyond the text; should a \nreader want to dispute what is recounted, then they would have to mobilize evidence \nfrom a laboratory of their own.  As Lorraine Daston writes, \u201c[s]cientific objects may \nnot be invented, but they grow more richly real as they become entangled in webs of \ncultural significance, material practices, and theoretical derivations\u201d (Daston 2000, \np. 13).  It is only through an increasing dependency upon the human world that \nobjects are acknowledged as independent entities within it. \n  \nThis is problematic for popular science as it is often the mediating aspects of \nscientific practice that make it inaccessible for non-expert readers.  Wells\u2019s solution \nis to re-present the object in a way that can appeal to these readers while not over-\nsimplifying the science.  He calls this \u201cinductive reading\u201d, and interestingly notes \nthat it already exists in another domain of literature:    \nThe taste for inductive reading is very widely diffused; there is a keen \npleasure in seeing a previously unexpected generalization skilfully \ndeveloped.  The interest should begin at its opening words, and should rise \nsteadily to its conclusion.  The fundamental principles of construction that \nunderlie such stories as Poe\u2019s \u201cMurders in the Rue Morgue\u201d or Conan \n  \n4\nDoyle\u2019s \u201cSherlock Holmes\u201d series, are precisely those that should guide a \nscientific writer.  These stories show that the public delights in the ingenious \nunravelling of evidence, and Conan Doyle need never stoop to jesting.  First \nthe problem, then the gradual piecing together of the solution.  They cannot \nget enough of such matter (Wells 1894, p. 301). \nBy recasting the scientific description of an object or phenomena as the solution to a \nmystery, the popular science writer can move from the familiar to the scientific in a \nway that maintains the reader\u2019s interest while replacing the former with the latter as \nthe \u201creal\u201d explanation.   \n \nAlthough Wells presents inductive reading as new, it is actually quite a common \nnarrative strategy in the popular science magazines of the period.  By recommending \nit to the elite scientific readers of Nature, Wells is endorsing this model of science \ncommunication over the others that featured in the popular science press.  What \ndistinguishes inductive reading is its emphasis on structure over rhetorical style.  \nWells, echoing Karl Pearson in the Grammar of Science, insists that a scientific \npaper for popular reading \u201cmay and should have an orderly progression and \ndevelopment\u201d (Wells, 1894, p. 301; Pearson 1892).  This is in contrast to what Wells \ncharacterizes as \u201cBadgers and Bats\u201d articles: \n He writes first of all about Badger A.  \u201cWe now come\u201d, he says, \u201cto Badger \n B\u201d; \u201cthen another interesting species is Badger C\u201d; paragraphs on Badger D \n follow, and so the pavement is completed.  \u201cLet us now turn to the Bats\u201d, he \n says.  It would not matter a bit if you cut any section of his book or paper \n out, or shuffled the sections, or destroyed most or all of them (Wells 1894, p. \n 301).  \nThe narrative strategy espoused by Wells grants the author teleological control over \nany content, and should provide enough narrative suspense to sustain the interest of \nthe reader without the need for further rhetorical flourishes.  He argues that \n\u201cscientific exponents who wish to be taken seriously should not only be precise and \nexplicit, but absolutely serious in style\u201d (Wells 1894, p. 301).  This seriousness \nensures that science writing is a proper employment for the scientist while criticizing \nmany of those who traditionally contribute popular science to the periodicals.  In \nattacking \u201cBadgers and Bats\u201d articles, Wells suggests that this sort of subject matter, \n  \n5\nchosen only for its alliteration, is unscientific and therefore not proper matter for \nscientists to discuss.  \n \nThese two types of writing are often present in the same title.  Hardwicke\u2019s Science-\nGossip was established by Mordecai Cubbitt Cooke and Robert Hardwicke in 1865 \nas a fourpenny monthly.  In 1872 John E Taylor, a popular and prolific scientific \nauthor and lecturer assumed the editorship and proprietorship of the title from \nCooke, editing it until ill-health and declining sales forced him to give it up in 1893.  \nThe title was resurrected in January 1894 by two entomologists, John T Carrington \nand Edward Step, who raised the price to sixpence.  Science-Gossip was closely \nassociated with the widespread natural history communities and the spectacular \ncover gestures towards this heritage (figure 1).  The dramatic Darwinian struggle for \nexistence in the centre is surrounded by symbols of amateur practice: at the top \nmicroscopes and telescopes point at both the small-but-close and far-but-large \nobjects of natural history and astronomy respectively; the elaborate border combines \nanimals from each major taxonomical group with the seasons that dictate the rhythm \nof the natural world; and of course the advertisement for Epps\u2019s Cocoa reminds us \nof the commercial concerns of the journal.  When Carrington and Step took over \nthey sought to alter the content of the magazine by encouraging more contributions \nfrom professional science writers.  This failed as they could not afford to pay the big \nnames and Science-Gossip continued to rely mostly on the amateur community and \nthe free copy they provided. \n  \n6\n \nFigure 1. \n \n  \n7\nThese two types of writing \u2013 that popular with the amateur naturalists and the \npopular form promoted by Wells \u2013 were often side-by-side in Science-Gossip.  In \nNovember 1892, Jason Saunders\u2019s \u201cWoodland Wanderers or the Mycetozoa\u201d \npresents a typical amateur naturalist piece that revolves about a personal account of \na particular type of natural object, the mycetozoa.  From its opening paragraph \nonwards it lacks the clarity and seriousness demanded by Wells: \nNot that our woods and shady coppices are the only haunts of the strange \ncreatures designated above [i.e. the \u201cWoodland Wanderers\u201d of the title], but \nthese are their homes par excellence.  Wherever there are shade and \nmoisture, associated with decaying vegetation, there will these curious and \ninteresting organisms almost certainly exist (Saunders 1892, p. 250). \nWhereas Wells demands scientific precision and accuracy, Saunders prefers to \nenthuse in his own terms.  He dismisses taxnomical concerns as a \u201crage\u201d which \n\u201cmay possibly be carried to an absurd length\u201d and then doubts \u201cif there be any truth \nin the assumption that all the creatures that inhabit the earth, have descended from \nsome few primordial forms of life\u201d (Saunders 1892, p.  250).  Although evolutionary \ntheory remained controversial in wider society, it was by this time scientific \northodoxy and in rejecting it along with taxonomy Saunders signals his marginality \nwithin the scientific community.  From such a position Saunders can disregard this \nimpersonal body of knowledge, and instead assert his own experiential knowledge in \nits place.   \n \nThis assertion of individual knowledge radically alters the status of the object being \ndescribed.  The combination of the playful tone of lines like \u201c[t]he we is not \neditorial, but covers two personalities, a juvenile enthusiast still in his teens and the \nwriter, the latter often finding material assistance from the sharp vision of more \nyouthful coadjutor\u201d with more literary evocations of the environment firmly link the \nmycetozoa with both the contingent moment of its discovery and the narrative of the \nauthor (Saunders 1892, 250).  By writing himself (and his partner) into the account, \nSaunders ensures that the reader can only encounter the object through the prism of \nthe authorial persona.  As such, the narrative represents a single observation, of an \nuncertain objectivity, and cannot claim, but equally does not aspire to, the status of \nimpersonal and definitive knowledge.  Instead it is accepted as an inductive account, \nlinked to a time and space.  Saunders's article is a contribution from a member of a \n  \n8\ncommunity, a fellow-worker in amateur science, and is one of the many which fills \nthe pages of the magazine.  In this way the natural objects that lie outside the text \nprompt further contributions, comparisons and comments and so become the points \naround which the social network of readers coheres. \n  \nThe following article in the November 1892 number of Science-Gossip is Edward A \nMartin\u2019s \u201cOn the Underground Geology of London\u201d.  This third person narrative  \nimmediately sets out the objects of the paper while simultaneously distancing the \nreader from the subject matter.  For example the opening paragraph: \nThere are few subjects of geological interest which have a greater fascination \nfor the theorising student, than the subject of the position which the various \ngeological strata have, and the directions which they take, under our great \nmetropolis. \nreveals the scientific object even while retaining it as the subject of authorial \ndiscourse (Martin 1892, 251).  From here the narrative is carefully structured, just as \nWells recommends, allowing Martin to slowly develop it according to his own \nterms.  The citations at the end of the third paragraph introduce the names of \neminent geologists such as De La B\u00eache and Prestwich, building upon their work \nwhile locating the text within a larger narrative of geological research.  The \nnumerical figures, introduced at the opening of the second paragraph in the second \ncolumn are what Bruno Latour calls inscriptions \u2013 textual components that can be \ntraced directly to the object being described.  As these figures are validated by the \nearth itself, they are incontestable unless readers have the resources to gather their \nown evidence.  As the reader of Science-Gossip is not figured as an expert geologist, \nMartin can build confidently upon them to recreate the strata beneath London upon \nthe page of the magazine in a series of diagrams.  Instead of linking the object with \nthe narrative of personal discovery, Martin\u2019s account posits it as an essential entity \noutside the text which confers authority onto his textual recreation.  This is a \ntautological, highly regulated piece of writing which, through a myth of distance, \nseeks to create an object which can be appreciated by the reader but remains under \nthe control of the author.  Instead of a single, contingent observation narrated by an \nobserver, we have a panoptic vision, presenting the information as objective fact \nwhich we are privileged to share. \n \n  \n9\nIt is this form of knowledge, in which an object is elucidated through the careful \nrevealing of evidence, that Wells supports as successful popular science.  Rather \nthan the rambling accounts of the amateur naturalists, full of incident and enjoyment \nthat could bind them together in a common pursuit, Wells\u2019s serious popular science \nseeks pleasure in its own careful representation of scientific objects.  Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, \nin Looking Awry, claims the detective story is inherently self-reflexive: \n It is a story of the detective\u2019s effort to tell the story, i.e. to reconstitute what \n \u201creally happened\u201d around and before the murder, and the novel is finished \n not when we get the answer to \u201cWhodunnit?\u201d but when the detective is \n finally able to tell \u201cthe real story\u201d in the form of a linear narrative (\u017di\u017eek \n 1991, p. 49). \nEqually, the allocation of pleasure is strictly controlled in popular science: readers \nare not encouraged to wonder at the marvels of the object or phenomena beyond the \ntext, but rather how the expositor writes it into his or her text.  For instance Martin\u2019s \npiece concludes with a reminder that the actual strata are not reducible to the \ndiagrams: \n In referring to the accompanying diagrams it must not of course, be \n overlooked that the scale used is one which exaggerates tremendously the \n depth of the strata, in proportion to the extent of the surface shown.  A true \n representation would be secured were the horizontal distance multiplied \n about fifty-three times, but this is obviously impossible in the case of a \n simple diagram (Martin 1892, p. 254). \nAlthough this does allude to the size of the area covered by his diagrams \u2013 and so \nhints at the scale of the object under discussion \u2013 the reader\u2019s attention is returned to \nthe patterns that they reveal on the page.  It is the author\u2019s handling of this material \nthat provides access to the object: rather than wonder at the sublimity of natural \nphenomena beyond the text, the reader instead wonders at the version within it. \n  \nJust as Martin alludes to the impressive scale of his research, so detective fiction \nnecessarily involves an element of voyeurism in the contemplation of the crime \nscene that is subsequently legitimated by restoration of order by the detective.    \nConsequently, there is always an element of spectacle in popular science writing, \nand this is often acknowledged within the textual account.  Knowledge was also a \nsix penny popular scientific monthly and so was in direct competition to Science-\n  \n10\nGossip from 1894.  Its first editor and proprietor Richard Anthony Proctor founded \nit as a cheap weekly rival to Nature in 1881 however, unable to draw upon the high-\nprofile contributors that were attracted by Nature, he was forced to raise the price \nand reduce the periodicity in 1885.  Proctor, like Lockyer, was an astronomer, but he \nwas a vocal opponent of the endowment of research and was involved in several \ndisputes with leading astronomers including the Astronomer Royal George Biddell \nAiry.  Although well-regarded as both an author and an astronomer, Proctor could \nnot rely on his own copy to make Knowledge pay and he had to depend on a number \nof popular science articles to sustain a readership and circulate the magazine.  Upon \nhis sudden death in 1888 another astronomer, Arthur Cowper Ranyard, took over the \neditorship and proprietorship and retained the increasingly divergent mix of research \nand popular articles.  The magazine lasted until 1917 and, reflecting the wider trend \nin scientific culture, absorbed the more amateur-oriented Science-Gossip in 1902. \n \nThe cover of Knowledge signals its history and readership (figure 2).  The sub-title \n\u201cSimply Worded \u2013 Exactly Described\u201d pre-empts Wells\u2019s description of popular \nscience writing, while the curved title \u201cKnowledge\u201d above the \u201can Illustrated \nMagazine of Science\u201d alludes to the cover of Nature, echoing its \u201cA Weekly \nIllustrated Journal of Science\u201d (Lightman 2004).  Each number of Knowledge was \ncontained within a substantial advertising wrapper for a range of scientific \ninstruments and publishing lists.  The instruments tended to be aimed at reasonably \nwell-off amateurs \u2013 especially astronomers \u2013 but the publications were a mix of \nscientific and nonscientific titles, indicating a fairly leisured, book-buying \nreadership.  After Ranyard assumed control of the title, it quickly gained a \nreputation for its visual material.  Ranyard was one of the first to regularly employ \nphotographic reproduction in his magazine, and these images allowed his readers \nunprecedented access to photographs which previously had to be rendered in another \nreproductive code (such as engraving or lithography) prior to inclusion.  These \ncollotypes were usually reserved by Ranyard for the discussion of astronomy, \nallowing his readers to see photographs that would otherwise remain beyond the text \nand usually in the possession of a few individuals or learned societies.  However, he \nalso used them as a lure to encourage contributions from other writers.  E.A. Butler \nwas a regular contributor of serial articles on insects and nearly every number of \nKnowledge between 1889 and 1894 contains an article by him.  In 1890 Ranyard \n  \n11\npermits Butler to reproduce a magic lantern slide (figure 3) to illustrate his serial \n\u2018The Common Flea\u2019.  The image confronts the reader with an object that is both \nfamiliar and slightly strange.  It is too transparent, too flat, and yet its overwhelming \nreality is both revolting and compelling.  Isobel Armstrong describes the voyeuristic \npleasures that the miscroscope afforded the nineteenth-century viewer: the \nmediating instrument is elided as the viewer is propelled into strange proximity to \nthese uncannily still objects (Armstrong 2002, 30-36).  Yet this position is carefully \nregulated when the microscope is replaced by a photographic reproduction and \nenlargement.  By subsituting the page for the mediating action of the instrument, the \nviewer is fixed at a single scopic site, reallocating pleasure from the manipulable \nobject beyond the text to the one that has been combined with it. \n  \n12\n \nFigure 2. \n  \n13\n \nFigure 3. \n \nThe letterpress accompanying the image is peculiarly overwritten.  Beginning in \nmedia res (it is a serial article after all) it opens with a discussion of the digestive \nsystem of the flea that combines a detailed physiological account and diagram with \ngory details of function.  The oesophagus, we read, is \u201ca rather short and narrow \ntube leading into a thick-walled gizzard, which, again, opens by its broader end into \n  \n14\na capacious bag, the stomach, big enough to hold a large draught of blood, such as \nthe insect is only too eager to suck in whenever it can get the opportunity.\u201d  Its \nalimentary canal \u201cwhen gorged with blood, can be rapidly emptied by the insect, and \nits contents ejected with considerable force, when a new and good supply of food \npresents itself before the last meal is disposed of.\u201d  These abstract details, which can \nonly be imagined, are related to the everyday: \n The dark stains on linen, that indicate where fleas have been, consist of their \n dried excrement, and are composed of the undigested remains of the blood \n corpuscules contained in the food.  Judging from the fact that rooms that \n have been long unoccupied are sometimes found to be swarming with fleas, \n it would seem that the perfect insects can subsist for a time without their \n customary food, although they are rapacious and insatiable enough when it is \n available (Butler 1890, p. 41). \nSuch shifts from the abstract to the familiar mirror the politics and erotics of the \nreproduced photograph.  Butler explains why his images look like they do (the \nsample has been flattened, and parts of its internal anatomy have been dissolved out \nto render it transparent), thus accounting for the difference between everyday \nexperience and the magnified image of the flea.  The grotesque details and the \nreproduced image thus serve the same purpose: they make the familiar strange in \norder that his narrative can account for this difference. \n \nAs Butler revels in the grotesque, his narrative tends to deviate from Wells\u2019s \ninsistence on seriousness.  However, the pleasure in these details aids the process of \nsubstituting the textual account of the flea, including the images, for the flea that \nexists beyond the text.  Just as the cost of indulging in the spectacle of the crime \nscene is assent to the detective\u2019s restoration of order in detective fiction, so in \nButler\u2019s article enjoyment of the grotesque is subject to his rendering of the object.  \nDrawing on Lacan, \u017di\u017eek claims that objects in detective fiction are like those in \ndream interpretation, with the detective as the analyst.  He writes that dreams, like \nthe scene of the crime, are doubly inscribed.  On the manifest level they seem to \npossess an organic unity, but the detective must read through this \u201cimaginary unity\u201d, \nand reveal the encoded level beneath (\u017di\u017eek 1991, pp. 51-3).  Butler, like Martin in \nScience-Gossip, unravels the unity represented by the everyday object and makes it \nstrange in order to reveal its true accounts through their narrative.  The popularizer \n  \n15\nhere is both the murderer and the detective, the dreamer and the analyst, and this \nsymmetry allows them to speak completely for the object, appropriating its \nmateriality as material for the telling.   \n \nIt is in the restoration of order that popular science subtly rearticulates its objects as \nobjects of desire.  In the accounts of the amateur naturalists it is the whole \nexperience, which the author narrates in order to emphasize its commonality, that \nallows the object act as a focal point for a community of readers.  Like a Sherlock \nHolmes case, the popular science of Wilson, Wells, Martin and Butler renders the \nfamiliar world strange, bewildering the reader before explaining the strangeness of \nthe \u2018case\u2019 with a Holmesian d\u00e9nouement.  In neither form of science writing can we  \ngain unmediated access to the objects of the past.  These objects have been \ntranslated, brought within the text, and then socialized within a historical and \ncultural context.  Rather than conceive of popular science journalism as accounts of \nobjects that exist beyond the text, whether in the past or in the present, we should \ninstead consider how the objects are related within the text.  Andrew Wilson \nsuggests that all readers are left unfulfilled by a successful narrative, and are eager \nto learn more.  However, this pleasure is predicated on the historically contingent \ntransformations of the material world that underpins both the preparation of \nscientific objects and the processes of publishing.  Although Wilson hopes his \nreaders will go on to develop an interest in science, he also hopes they will go on to \nbuy more of his books.  It is only by linking the words and images on the page to the \nmaterials from which they are derived that we can understand the otherwise muted \ncultural histories of things, whether scientific objects or the various things that make \nup the subjects of print journalism.  \n \nWorks Cited \n \nArmstrong, Isobel (2002) \u201cThe microscope: mediations of the sub-visible world\u201d, in:  \nRoger Luckhurst and Josephine McDonagh (Eds), Transactions and Encounters:  \nscience and culture in the nineteenth century, Manchester: Manchester University \nPress, pp. 30-54. \n \nButler, E.
