Res., 114, A08211, doi:10.1029\/2008JA013997.\n1. Introduction\n[2] The substorm phenomenon has been widely studied at\nthe Earth for many years. It is a way for magnetic energy to\nbe released in the nightside magnetosphere with a wide\nvariety of consequent changes observed in the aurora,\nmagnetic field, energetic particles, electrical currents, and\nconvection [e.g., Akasofu, 1964; Russell and McPherron,\n1973; Angelopoulos et al., 2008]. Reconnection events\nassociated with substorms are generally identified by sharp\nchanges in the north\/south component of the magnetic field,\ncorresponding to dipolarizations of the field, or plasmoids\npassing the spacecraft. These signatures are often accom-\npanied by strong plasma flows and plasma energization\n[e.g., Nakamura et al., 2002]. In addition, remote diagnos-\ntics such as global energetic neutral atom fluxes have also\nbeen investigated [e.g., Brandt et al., 2002; Mitchell et al.,\n2003; Fok et al., 2006]. More recently, the dynamics of the\nmagnetotails of Jupiter and Saturn have become a topic of\ngreat interest with some similar substorm-like signatures\nbeing observed in situ [e.g., Kronberg et al., 2005, 2007;\nJackman et al., 2007, 2008]. Here we will focus on the\nrelationship between substorm-like events observed in situ\nin Saturn\u2019s magnetotail and remote sensing of Saturn\u2019s radio\nemissions. We will explore enhancements in the intensity of\nradio emissions coincident with substorm-like events and\nalso explain the link between lower-frequency emissions\nand the motion of radio sources.\n1.1. Terrestrial Radio Emissions and Substorms\n[3] A direct relationship has been observed between the\nintense radio emission from the Earth\u2019s auroral regions\ncalled auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) and substorms\n[Benediktov et al., 1968; Gurnett, 1974; Kurth et al., 1975;\nKaiser and Alexander, 1977]. Substorms cause abrupt\nacceleration of particles along magnetic field lines which\nmap into the auroral zones and help drive the westward\nsubstorm (DP1) electrojet. These particles can also generate\nAKR by the cyclotron maser instability (CMI) [e.g., Wu\nand Lee, 1979] on field lines at geocentric distances of\n\u00012\u20134 RE. While the average power of AKR is found to\nincrease with substorm activity, the correlation is not always\nperfect, primarily due to visibility effects. In general, AKR\nprovides a good indication of magnetic substorm activity,\nprovided the measurements are taken within the regions\nof primary illumination for the AKR, and at distances\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 114, A08211, doi:10.1029\/2008JA013997, 2009\n1Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London, London, UK.\n2LESIA, Observatoire de Paris, Universite\u00b4 Paris Diderot, UPMC,\nCNRS, Meudon, France.\n3British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\n4Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Iowa, Iowa City,\nIowa, USA.\n5Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/09\/2008JA013997\nA08211 1 of 13\nsufficiently remote from the Earth to avoid local propagation\ncutoff effects associated with the shadow zone [Voots et al.,\n1977; Green et al., 1977]. Recent work has focused on\ndeciphering the precise beaming characteristics of the AKR\nand implies that AKR observations from remote locations\nsample only a small part of the auroral oval from any given\nlocation [Mutel et al., 2008].\n[4] The frequency of the AKR emission, f, is related to\nthe position of the radio source along the field line, due to\nthe fact that the emission is generated at or close to the local\nelectron cyclotron frequency, fCE, which in turn is propor-\ntional to the total field strength. Substituting the formula for\ndipole magnetic field strength into the equation for the\nelectron cyclotron frequency and rearranging, we find\nR\nRP\n\u00bc eBeq\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1\u00fe 3Sin2l\np\n2pme f\n !1\n3\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere RP (=6371 km) is the planetary radius, R is the\ndistance from the planet\u2019s center, l is the magnetic latitude,\nBeq = 31,100 nT is magnetic field strength at the planet\u2019s\nsurface on the equator, e is the electron charge, and me is the\nelectron mass. Figure 1, reproduced from Lamy et al. [2008]\n(hereinafter referred to as L08), is a schematic diagram of\nradio emissions from Saturn but is also applicable to Earth\nand Jupiter. It illustrates the beaming characteristics and\nshadow zones mentioned above, along with the relation-\nship between emission frequency and source altitude on a\nfield line.\n[5] The AKR shows abrupt frequency expansion into\nlower (and sometimes higher) frequencies at substorm\nonset [Kaiser and Alexander, 1977; Anderson et al.,\n1997, 1998]. Using Polar plasma wave instrumentation\n(PWI) observations, Morioka et al. [2007] identified two\nsource regions at substorm onset. The higher-frequency\n(\u0001300\u2013500 kHz) component of AKR (\u2018\u2018MF-AKR\u2019\u2019) seems\nto persist before, during, and after substorm onset and is\nseemingly largely insensitive to the moment of substorm\nonset. The lower-frequency (\u000130\u2013150 kHz) component of\nAKR (\u2018\u2018LF-AKR\u2019\u2019) abruptly appears at substorm onset, with\na sudden frequency expansion, explosive amplitude growth,\nand little frequency drift.Morioka et al. [2008] suggested that\nthese AKR breakup signatures indicate the abrupt formation\nat the substorm onset of a new high-altitude field-aligned\nparticle acceleration region between \u00018000 and 18,000 km\naltitude, consistent with equation (1) for emissions within the\nauroral oval at l \u0001 70\u0001 latitude.\n[6] We suggest that the physical mechanism behind\nextension of the radio emission to lower frequency fol-\nlowing substorms may be explained as follows: Substorms\ngenerate field-aligned currents in the auroral zones whose\ndensity may exceed the maximum value that can be\ncarried by magnetospheric electrons without acceleration.\nThis is given by\njki0 \u00bc eN Wth\n2pme\n\u0005 \u00061=2\n; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere the magnetospheric electron population has been\nassumed to be an isotropic Maxwellian of density N and\nthermal energy Wth. This expression corresponds to the case\nof a full downward going loss cone and an empty upward\ngoing loss cone. Under such conditions of strong upward\nfield-aligned current enhancement, and according to\nKnight\u2019s [1973] kinetic theory, a field-aligned voltage must\nexist along the auroral field lines which accelerates\nmagnetospheric electrons into the ionosphere to produce\nthe required current. We might plausibly expect that the\nauroral and radio sources will be stimulated by this\nprecipitation. The extent of the field-aligned voltage drop\nis directly related to the field-aligned current density [e.g.,\nCowley et al., 2004], and the minimum distance of the\n\u2018\u2018top\u2019\u2019 of the voltage drop is given by\nrmin\nRi\n\u0005 \u0006\n\u0007 jki\njki0\n\u0005 \u00061=3\n\u00f03\u00de\nwhere Ri is the radial distance of the ionospheric current\nlayer. Thus we suggest that the extension of the auroral\nacceleration region to higher altitude is a direct consequence\nof the strong field-aligned currents and associated electron\nprecipitation which can be driven by substorms. AKR is\ngenerated at or close to the local electron cyclotron\nfrequency, which in turn is proportional to the total field\nstrength. Thus for an acceleration region at higher altitude,\nthe radio emissions have characteristically lower frequency.\n[7] The existence of a low-altitude (MF-AKR) accelera-\ntion region between \u00013000 and 5000 km altitude seems to\nbe a necessary condition for the ignition of the high-altitude\nbursty acceleration discussed by Morioka et al. [2007].\nSixty four of 92 events (69.5%) studied by Morioka et al.\n[2007] were either dual source or wide source, indicating\nthat the appearance of a new AKR source region on a\nhigher-altitude auroral field line is a common feature at\nterrestrial substorm onset. This raises the question: do\nsimilar processes occur at other planets?\n1.2. Jovian Radio Emissions and Energetic Events\n[8] Magnetic field and energetic particle data suggest that\nJupiter\u2019s magnetosphere is periodically affected by large-\nscale energetic phenomena which are analogous to terres-\ntrial substorms [e.g., Krupp et al., 1998; Woch et al., 1998;\nKronberg et al., 2005, 2007]. Louarn et al. [1998] presented\nevidence for a link between such substorm-like events (as\nevidenced particularly by plasma sheet thinnings) and low-\nfrequency Jovian radio emissions. Subsequently, Louarn\net al. [2000] surveyed \u00019 months of Galileo data and\nfound that the substorm-like events correspond to global\nincreases in the flux of various radio emissions and to\nspectral\/temporal modifications in their morphology. They\ncharacterized these radio emissions using two identifica-\ntion criteria: the simultaneous observation of an increase\nin the flux of the auroral radio emissions and the creation\nof a new source of n-KOM (a low-frequency component\nof the Jovian radio emission). They identified 32 events\nduring 130 days of observation distributed over a 245-day\nperiod and found this corresponds to an average recur-\nrence time of 3.8 days.\n[9] In this paper we will now focus our attention on\nthe Kronian system and observe how Saturn kilometric\nA08211 JACKMAN ET AL.: LOWER-FREQUENCY RADIO EMISSIONS AT SATURN\n2 of 13\nA08211\nradiation (SKR) emissions compare with AKR and Jovian\nemissions in their response to substorm-like events.\n1.3. Kronian Radio Emissions and Magnetospheric\nDynamics\n[10] Prior to the arrival at Saturn of the Cassini spacecraft\non 1 July 2004, remote sensing studies of the planet\u2019s radio\nemissions, specifically of SKR, were the primary source of\ninformation concerning the dynamics of Saturn\u2019s magneto-\nsphere and its interaction with the solar wind. SKR was\ndetected by the Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) exper-\niment on Voyager-1 in 1980 [Kaiser et al., 1980]. It is\nanalogous to terrestrial AKR, with a spectrum that spreads\nfrom \u00013 kHz to 1.2 MHz, with the broad peak generally\nlocated between 100 and 400 kHz [e.g., Kaiser et al., 1984].\nSimilar to AKR, SKR is believed to be generated by the\nCMI in the auroral acceleration region and indeed appears\nto be associated with UVaurorae caused by the precipitation\ninto the atmosphere of accelerated electrons with energies in\nthe range \u00011\u201320 keV [Cowley et al., 2004]. Cecconi et al.\n[2009] show that southern SKR sources are distributed\nalong magnetic field lines with footprints between \b80\nand \b65\u0001, encompassing the main auroral oval which\ntypically lies between \b70 and \b75\u0001 latitude in quiet\nmagnetospheric conditions [Badman et al., 2006].\n[11] Strong correlations have been found between SKR\nemission and solar wind dynamic pressure modulations\n[e.g., Desch and Rucker, 1983; Taubenschuss et al.,\n2006]. In January 2004, a joint Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) and Cassini campaign was undertaken which included\nconcurrent measurements of the solar wind and interplan-\netary magnetic field (IMF), SKR emissions, and Saturn\u2019s\nUV aurora. Following a solar wind compression, the\nauroral oval was observed to brighten and expand signif-\nicantly poleward [e.g., Clarke et al., 2005] and the usual\nmodulation of SKR at about the planetary rotation period\nwas disrupted. Specifically, the SKR emissions were found\ninitially to intensify with a spectrum that spread to lower\nfrequencies followed by a period of quiet SKR [Jackman\net al., 2005]. However, Kurth et al. [2005] noted that the\nUnified Radio and Plasma Wave experiment on board the\nUlysses spacecraft detected SKR during this period. This\nsuggests that the effect of the solar wind compression was\ninitially to intensify the SKR emissions and then subse-\nquently disrupt their beaming pattern, such that they could\nnot be observed by Cassini. This is supported by Badman\net al. [2008] who studied the pattern of SKR during\n2003\u20132004, while Cassini was still upstream of Saturn,\nand following Saturn orbit insertion (SOI) during Cassini\nRev A in the solar wind. They found that magnetospheric\ncompressions generally produced intense bursts of SKR\nbut did not otherwise significantly alter the pulsing of the\nemission.\n[12] Cowley et al. [2005] suggested that such auroral and\nSKR effects can be due to bursts of rapid magnetotail\nreconnection induced by shock compressions of the mag-\nnetosphere. This was investigated by Bunce et al. [2005]\nwho explored the behavior of the SKR during the SOI pass\nin July 2004 and identified a strong burst of SKR coincident\nwith a magnetic field disturbance and hot plasma acceler-\nation symptomatic of tail reconnection. The burst of SKR\nextended down to lower frequencies and disturbed the\nprevious planetary-modulated radio emissions, which then\nreasserted themselves after several cycles. Thus the SOI\nbehavior was similar to that observed in January 2004, with\nthe added benefit of in situ fields and particles measure-\nments from which the reconnection mechanism could be\ninferred.\n[13] Since 2004, Cassini has completed many orbits of\nthe Kronian magnetosphere, and these have afforded us a\nchance to study magnetotail dynamics in much more detail\nthan before. Using data from the Cassini magnetometer,\nJackman et al. [2007] found three more examples of tail\nreconnection events in situ, while Jackman et al. [2008]\nthen supplemented this work with a multi-instrument study\nof these three events plus an additional two. In general, tail\nreconnection events and the resultant passage of plasmoids\nare associated with strong magnetic perturbations and bursts\nof energetic particles and thus have strong parallels with\nreconnection within terrestrial substorms in terms of their\nobservable effects.\nFigure 1. Schematic illustrating the equatorial shadow\nzone produced by anisotropic beaming of SKR. Stars\nrepresent radio sources at two frequencies ( f1 \t f2) along\nthe same magnetic field line (solid line). Radio emission is\nbeamed along a hollow cone (black arrows). The dashed\nlines represent the isocontours corresponding to f = fce.\nFigure reproduced from Lamy et al. [2008, Figure 7].\nA08211 JACKMAN ET AL.: LOWER-FREQUENCY RADIO EMISSIONS AT SATURN\n3 of 13\nA08211\n[14] Rapid reconnection can also result in the production\nof energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) via charge exchange with\nthe energetic particles produced. Mitchell et al. [2005]\nfound that strong ENA fluxes indicative of an Earth-like\nsubstorm process typically emanate from the region of\n\u000120\u201330 RS. They suggested this radial range as the likely\ntypical location of the reconnection site and found in turn\nthat strong ENA fluxes from this region were well corre-\nlated with enhancements in SKR. Hill et al. [2008] studied\nthe pattern of ENA emissions prior to a known reconnection\nevent in the Kronian tail and were able to pinpoint the\nsource of energization and hence the likely reconnection site\nto \u000126 RS downtail.\n[15] Thus the link between solar wind-driven aurorae,\nreconnection, substorms, and SKR emissions appears to be\na strong one. In this paper, we will focus on the relationship\nbetween in situ observations of substorm-like events on\nSaturn\u2019s nightside, and the resultant SKR emissions. In\nsection 2 we outline the data sets used, while in section 3\nwe show three case studies of magnetic field and SKR data\nfrom the deep tail orbits of 2006. In section 4 we explore in\ndetail the typical character of the low-frequency part of the\nSKR spectrum, the visibility factors that impact its interpre-\ntation, and its possible links to dynamic nightside processes.\n2. Data Set\n[16] For this paper, we combine data from the Cassini\nmagnetometer (MAG) [Dougherty et al., 2004] with that\nfrom the Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS)\ninstrument [Gurnett et al., 2004]. As mentioned above, the\nMAG data are used to identify reconnection events in the\nmagnetotail which are typically indicated by northward\/\nsouthward turnings of the field. These can often be accom-\npanied by signatures of angular momentum conservation, as\nplasma speeds up\/slows down in response to reconnection\nand resulting reconfiguration of the field on the nightside.\n[17] We use the RPWS data to provide information about\nthe SKR, which is an extremely useful diagnostic of global\nmagnetospheric dynamics. The data set we use is an\nextension of that derived by L08 and based on previous\nwork by Zarka et al. [2004] and Cecconi and Zarka [2005].\nL08 calibrated the near-continuous RPWS data from SOI\nonward and derived the intensity and circular polarization\nstate of the observed radio waves as a function of time and\nfrequency. The processed data comprise a spectrum every\n180 s, consisting of 24 logarithmically spaced channels\nbetween 3.5 and 300 kHz (with Df\/f = 20%) and 24 linearly\nspaced channels (with df = 50 kHz) between 350 and\n1500 kHz. The specific products used in this paper are the\nreceived flux density (in W m\b2 Hz\b1) normalized to 1 AU\nand the emitted power (in W sr\b1).\n2.1. Visibility of Radio Emissions\n[18] The key to careful interpretation of radio data is an\nunderstanding of the role of visibility effects, which are\nhighly dependent on spacecraft location. As mentioned\nabove, the SKR spectrum typically extends from a few kHz\nto 1200 kHz, with a peak between 100 and 400 kHz. On the\nbasis of 2.75 years of post-SOI data, L08 found that the R-X\nmode is the dominant mode of emission, but Cassini also\ndetected some weaker L-O mode emissions. Goniopolari-\nmetric (direction finding) measurements confirm that right-\nhand (RH) polarized emission comes from the Northern\nHemisphere, with left-hand (LH) coming from the south.\nLH and RH spectra are conjugate with respect to spacecraft\nlatitude (lSC), and thus they are added together in the data\nprocessing to derive the average variations of SKR visibility.\n[19] While SKR is observed quasi-continuously, there are\nstrong variations of visibility as a function of observer\nposition, both in local time (LT) and latitude. In general,\nthe variable visibility along Cassini\u2019s orbit is consistent with\nsources at or close to the local electron cyclotron frequency\nfce in the LT sector 0900\u20131200 h and at latitudes \t70\u0001.\nMeasured SKR intensities are generally larger on the dawn-\nside, with weakest emissions observed between 16 and 20 h.\nHowever, we note that SKR can be observed from a large\nrange of LT, not just restricted to the dawn-to-noon sector\n[e.g., Cecconi et al., 2009]. Farrell et al. [2005] observed\nSKR during the nightside passage of SOI which they claim\noriginated from the near-midnight region of field lines near\nL\u000110\u201315. This suggests the presence of an active region\nin the nightside inner magnetosphere.\n[20] The main visibility constraint with radial distance\narises due to the anisotropic nature of the emission, which is\nthought to be beamed along hollow cones centered on the\nlocal magnetic field vector. L08 found that this beaming\nresults in the existence of an equatorial shadow zone as\nillustrated schematically in Figure 1 (out to radial distance\nof \u00014 RS at 169 kHz and \u00016\u20137 RS at 80 kHz). Additionally,\nSKR visibility is known to be affected by observer latitude,\nwith maximum SKR intensity and frequency extent being\nobserved between 20 and 40\u0001. At much higher latitudes\n(>\u000155\u0001), L08 reported a systematic disappearance of SKR\nat high frequencies. Modeling work has simulated this\ndisappearance by assuming the SKR sources are colocated\nwith the UV auroral oval [Lamy, 2008].\n2.2. Lower-Frequency Components\n[21] While the SKR spectrum may be most intense in the\nrange \u0001100\u2013400 kHz [L08], there are also two well defined\nlower-frequency components to Saturn\u2019s radio spectrum,\nboth of which are preferentially observed from high lati-\ntudes and are modulated at or close to the SKR rotational\nperiodicity. The first is n-SMR (narrowband Saturnian\nMyriametric Radiation), named by Louarn et al. [2007].\nThis is an intense but weakly polarized emission that\nappears below 10 kHz. The second is a narrowband kilo-\nmetric component (n-SKR) which extends mainly between\n10 and 40 kHz but sometimes as low as 3 kHz. It corre-\nsponds to the narrowband electromagnetic emissions first\nreported by Gurnett et al. [1981] and is less intense than the\nmain SKR and the n-SMR, with a peak at \u000120 kHz. L08\nhave suggested that it is indeed a separate feature of Saturn\u2019s\nradio spectrum, based on observation of the polarization of\nthe emissions. Z. Wang et al. (Cassini observations of\nnarrowband radio emissions in Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere,\nsubmitted to Journal of Geophysical Research, 2008) and\nYe et al. [2009] investigated the source of the narrowband\nemissions in the frequency range of 5\u201330 kHz and noted that\nthe narrowband emissions often occur near 5 kHz, with other\napparently associated bands between 20 and 30 kHz. While\nLouarn et al. [2007] have shown that these emissions can be\nintensified following an increase in SKR intensity and\nA08211 JACKMAN ET AL.: LOWER-FREQUENCY RADIO EMISSIONS AT SATURN\n4 of 13\nA08211\nbandwidth, it is not the purpose of this paper to address these\nemissions. Rather, we focus on the expansion of the main\nband of auroral SKR to lower frequencies and its growth to\nlarger intensities, in response to substorm-like events.\n3. Case Study Examples\n[22] In this section we show three case study examples of\nknown reconnection events in Saturn\u2019s magnetotail. The\nMAG data for two of these events have been discussed by\nJackman et al. [2008] but here we show the corresponding\nRPWS data and study the correlation between these\nsubstorm-like events and SKR emissions.\n3.1. Example A: Day 169, 2006\n[23] Figure 2 shows data from day 167\u2013170 2006.\nFigure 2a shows a frequency-time spectrogram of radio\nemission from the RPWS instrument, over the frequency\nrange 3.9\u2013800 kHz, with flux values corresponding to the\ngrayscale on the right of the plot. Figure 2b shows the\nemitted SKR power normalized to 1 AU in Watts per\nsteradian, with the solid line showing the power integrated\nover the 4\u20131000 kHz range and the dotted line showing\nthe 100\u2013300 kHz range. Vertical dot-dashed lines indicate\nthe times when Cassini is at 100\u0001 subsolar longitude in the\nKurth et al. [2008] longitude system, around which SKR\nis expected to maximize on average. Figures 2c\u20132e show\nthe radial, theta, and azimuthal components of the magnetic\nfield in KRTP coordinates. In this system, the radial compo-\nnent (Br) is positive outward from Saturn, the theta compo-\nnent (Bq) is positive southward, and the azimuthal\ncomponent (B8) is positive in the direction of corotation.\nFigure 2f shows the total magnetic field strength. Universal\ntime, radial distance, latitude, and local time are given\nbeneath the plot.\n[24] Cassini observed a traveling compression region\n(TCR) at 0034 UT on day 169 (18 June), when the\nspacecraft was at \u000162.29 RS downtail, 1.5 h LT, and a\nlatitude of 0.3\u0001 [Jackman et al., 2008], and this time is\nmarked on Figures 2c\u20132f by a vertical dashed line. TCRs\nare magnetic signatures observed in the lobe, thought to be\ncaused by localized bulges in the plasma sheet due to the\nformation and rapid movement of plasmoid-type flux ropes\ndown tail [e.g., Slavin et al., 1984]. Ideally we would like to\nknow the timing and location of the reconnection event that\nspawned this plasmoid. However, in order to calculate\nplasmoid speeds, we need reliable ion moments from the\nCAPS Ion Mass Spectrometer (IMS), and extraction of\nthese is complicated by several factors. In this case, velocity\ndata was not available, so in order to obtain a rough estimate\nof the timing of the reconnection event, we make some\nassumptions based on the work of Hill et al. [2008]. They\nFigure 2. RPWS and MAG data from day 167\u2013170, 2006, showing (a) a frequency-time spectrogram\nof the radio emissions and (b) the band-integrated SKR power across 4\u20131000 kHz (solid line) and\n100\u2013300 kHz (dashed line) ranges.

Trajectory information is given at the bottom.\nA08211 JACKMAN ET AL.: LOWER-FREQUENCY RADIO EMISSIONS AT SATURN\n5 of 13\nA08211\nused available ion velocity data combined with ENA fluxes\nto deduce the reconnection site location and plasmoid speed\nfor one event in 2006. They found the maximum measured\nion flow speed for the plasmoid was \u0001800 km\/s, with a\nreconnection site location near \u000130 RS. They placed an\nupper limit of \u00011000 km\/s on the tailward speed of the\nO-line, and an average of \u0001500 km\/s on the X-line speed. If\nwe assume 800 km\/s as a plasmoid speed and work back-\nward from our TCR observation at \u000162.29 RS, we find a\ntravel time of 40 min 32 s for a plasmoid released at 30 RS to\nreach Cassini. Thus as a rough estimate based on the\navailable data, we might expect the reconnection event to\nhave occurred on day 168 at \u00012354 UT. In Figure 2b, we\nhave bracketed this time with error bars (corresponding to\nplasmoid speeds of 500\u20131000 km\/s), thus marking out a\nplausible interval during which the reconnection event, \u2018\u2018R,\u2019\u2019\nmay have occurred.\n[25] Returning to Figure 2a, we note that the SKR\nemissions are relatively quiet for day 167 and most of day\n168 and there are several intervals where no emission is\nobserved. The emissions during this period are largely\nconfined to the \u0001100\u2013400 kHz band, where the bulk of\nthe SKR emission is typically observed, and the average\nintegrated power over this range is of order 1 \n 107 W sr\b1.\nHowever, at the end of day 168 there is a very strong burst\nof SKR emission, with maximum power of 2.2 \n 109 W\nsr\b1, and an extension to frequencies below 10 kHz. This\nburst lasts for more than 4 h and is followed by a second,\nslightly smaller burst on day 169, which peaks at 2 \n 109 W\nsr\b1 and also exhibits extension to low frequencies. This\nsecond burst is then followed by a period of quiet SKR with\naverage powers more than 2 orders of magnitude smaller\nthan the previous bursts. The emissions reassert themselves\nfrom the start of day 170, with average powers for that day\nexceeding 1 \n 107 W sr\b1.\n[26] We note that the first large burst (end of day 168)\noccurred before the observation of the TCR but close to the\npossible timing of the reconnection event itself. This could\noccur if energetic electrons produced during the reconnec-\ntion event precipitated into the auroral zones and triggered\nSKR nearly instantaneously, before the plasmoid had time\nto travel to the deep magnetotail to result in the observed\nmagnetic signature. We suggest that the character of the\nemissions observed here is similar to that reported for AKR\nby Morioka et al. [2007]. As discussed in section 1.1, they\nobserved two bands of AKR emission: one at higher\nfrequencies that is largely insensitive to substorm onset and\nanother at lower frequencies which appears abruptly at sub-\nstorm onset. It seems plausible to suggest that the data we\nshow here follow a similar pattern, with quasi-continuous\nhigher-frequency emission before, during, and after the\nobservation of the TCR, and a strong extension of the\nspectrum to lower frequency prior to the observation of\nthe TCR but around the projected onset time of this\nsubstorm-like reconnection event.\n[27] We note also that Morioka et al. [2007] suggested\nseveral scenarios for AKR source motion that resulted in the\n\u2018\u2018dual-component\u2019\u2019 AKR spectra they observed coincident\nwith terrestrial substorms. As SKR is emitted close to the\nfCE, which is directly proportional to magnetic field and thus\nto altitude, the frequency we observe can be related directly\nto source altitude (as detailed in section 1.3 above). We thus\nexpect that sources higher along the field lines are respon-\nsible for the low-frequency extensions we observe here.\nGoniopolarimetric (direction-finding) tools have been\ndeveloped [Cecconi et al., 2009] to analyze the characteristics\nof the SKR sources, with overall accuracy on direction of\narrival of order 2\u0001. Unfortunately, as Cassini was more than\n60 RS downtail during this observation, it was not possible\nto use these tools to accurately resolve the source locations\nof the radio emissions. Nevertheless, on the basis of\nemission from the center of the main auroral oval (72\u0001,\nsee section 1.3) at the electron cyclotron frequency in a\ndipole Kronian magnetic field with equatorial field strength\n20 mT, we would predict from equation (1) that the quasi-\ncontinuous emissions between \u0001100 and \u0001400 kHz come\nfrom a Kronian-centric distance of 1.4\u20132.2 RS and the\nlower-frequency extension down to \u000110 kHz reaches to a\ndistance of 4.8 RS.\n[28] On examination of the SKR emissions over the full\ninterval shown in Figure 2, we note that the peak integrated\npowers for the two large bursts surrounding the TCR\nobservation were an order of magnitude higher than the\npeak powers for the surrounding days. However, the large\nbursts did not appear to disrupt the pattern of planetary\nphasing as outlined by the vertical dashed lines. Periods of\nstrong SKR emissions have been shown by both Voyager\nand Cassini to be consistent with the impact of solar wind\ncompressions on the magnetosphere and suggested by\nseveral authors to be associated with possible dynamics in\nthe magnetotail [e.g., Cowley et al., 2005; Bunce et al.,\n2005]. However, the occurrence or otherwise of a solar\nwind compression cannot be confirmed without the presence\nof an upstream monitor, and as noted by Badman et al.\n[2008], even large solar wind compressions do not necessar-\nily result in \u2018\u2018out of phase\u2019\u2019 SKR bursts.\n3.2. Example B: Day 060, 2006\n[29] Figure 3 shows RPWS and MAG data from day 58\u2013\n61 2006, in the same format as Figure 2. Cassini executed a\nclose flyby of Titan on day 058 at \u00010825 UT and the\nmagnetic signature is visible in all components. Following\nthat, the data showed a regular pattern of periodic current\nsheet encounters (evidenced by a zero radial component at\nthe center of the sheet). For the purposes of this discussion\nwe may assume that Cassini is essentially stationary with\nrespect to the current sheet, which is flapping across the\nspacecraft with a periodicity linked in some way to the\nplanetary rotation rate [e.g., Khurana et al., 2009; Jackman\net al., 2009; C. S. Arridge et al., manuscript in preparation,\n2009]. On day 059 at \u00010800 UT the current sheet moves\nacross Cassini, and the radial field component on the\nopposite side of the sheet is \u0001+2 nT. The next encounter\nis later that day at \u00011900 UT, where, despite the spacecraft\nmaintaining the same latitude, the positive excursion of the\nradial component is less than 2 nT. The next encounter with\nthe current sheet is on day 060 at \u00010500 UT. This time\nthe radial component just reaches zero, indicating that the\ncurrent sheet has just briefly touched Cassini as it moved\ndown toward the spacecraft. During the interval encom-\npassing these three current sheet encounters, Cassini\nmoved tailward \u00015 RS, keeping a constant spacecraft\nlatitude. These progressively decreasing passes through the\ncenter of the sheet may either indicate a decrease in the degree\nA08211 JACKMAN ET AL.: LOWER-FREQUENCY RADIO EMISSIONS AT SATURN\n6 of 13\nA08211\nof current sheet flapping or a progressively thinning current\nsheet, both spatially with increasing radial distance, and\ntemporally, suggesting the onset of a reconnection event.\nIndeed, on day 060 at \u00010730 UT, Cassini observed a\nplasmoid signature in the form of a sharp northward turning\nof the magnetic field. A vertical dashed line through Figures\n3c\u20133f shows this timing. As this plasmoid was observed at a\nradial distance of \u000132 RS, we suggest that it was released\nduring a reconnection event planetward of this position.\n[30] Looking to Figures 3a and 3b, we note that through-\nout the entire 4-day period shown here, there is nearly\nconstant SKR emission in the \u0001100\u2013400 kHz frequency\nband. On day 059 between \u00011200 and 1700 UT there is a\ncontinuous extension of the emission to the lowest-frequency\nchannels. The burst occurs exactly in phase with the expected\npulsing shown by the vertical dashed lines in Figure 3b, and\nthe SKR power at this time peaks at \u00014.8 \n 109 W sr\b1.\nThere is then a second, broader burst of SKR with low-\nfrequency extension on day 060 from \u00010830 to 1500 UT,\npeaking at\u00011.9\n 109 W sr\b1. The low-frequency extension\nassociated with this burst occurs in phase with the predicted\npulsing. Again, these emissions have similar character to\nthose reported with AKR data at the Earth by Morioka et al.\n[2007]. The peak intensities of the fluxes during the SKR\nbursts of day 059 and day 060 are significantly higher\n(by about an order of magnitude) than the surrounding\npeak fluxes.\n[31] As for example A, we have calculated the expected\ntiming of the reconnection event associated with the\nobserved plasmoid, using an assumed source at 30 RS and\nincorporating the velocity estimates of Hill et al. [2008]. For\na plasmoid velocity of 800 km\/s, we obtain a reconnection\nevent time of \u00010727.55 UT, and this is shown in Figure 3b.\nThe error bars to represent upper and lower velocity\nestimates of 500 and 1000 km\/s are omitted as they are\ntoo close to the value at \u00010727.55 UT to be seen on the\nscale of this plot. The expected timing of the reconnection\nevent coincides closely with the onset of the strong burst of\nemission on day 060. We thus suggest that, in a similar way\nto example A, the process of magnetic reconnection has\nstimulated SKR emissions which have been observed to\nextend to the lower reaches of the spectrum, implying the\nspread in altitude of the radio sources in response to\nprecipitating energized electrons. However, the cause of\nthe first large burst of SKR on day 059, with its accompa-\nnying extension to lower frequencies is not as clear. As\nnoted above, both of these bursts are observed from sub-\nsolar longitudes of \u0001100\u0001, around which SKR power is\nmaximized on average, however the peak power and\npresence of the low-frequency component are clearly dif-\nferent from the surrounding days. Consequently, one inter-\npretation is that the first SKR burst is also caused by an\nenergetic reconnection event, but there is no detectable\nmagnetic signature. As described by Jackman et al.\nFigure 3. RPWS and MAG data from day 58\u201361, 2006, in the same format as Figure 2.\nA08211 JACKMAN ET AL.: LOWER-FREQUENCY RADIO EMISSIONS AT SATURN\n7 of 13\nA08211\n[2007], the search for plasmoids is hampered somewhat by\nthe trajectory of Cassini. Owing to the hinging of the\nmagnetotail current sheet, when the spacecraft is orbiting\nin the deep magnetotail at low latitudes, it may be below the\nnominal current sheet location, where plasmoids are most\nlikely to be observed. The waiting time between these two\nLFEs appears short (\u00011 day) compared to the expected\nwaiting time of 5\u20137 days between substorm-like events\nbased on empirical estimates of flux addition and closure\nat Saturn [e.g., Jackman et al., 2004]. However, we note\nthat at Earth the most common substorm waiting time is\n2\u20133 h even though the average waiting time is approxi-\nmately 6 h, and about 4% of waiting times are less than\n1 h [Borovsky et al., 1993]. Alternatively, LFEs are not\nuniquely associated with substorms.\n3.3. Example C: Day 193, 2006\n[32] Figure 4 shows a third example of RPWS and MAG\ndata from day 192\u2013194 of 2006. The magnetic feature of inter-\nest here (marked by vertical dashed lines in Figures 4c\u20134f)\nis the northward turning of the field on day 193 (12 July) at\n0730 UT, when the spacecraft was at \u000148.37 RS downtail, a\nLT of 23.87 h and a latitude of 0.44\u0001. This event was\ndiscussed in detail by Jackman et al. [2007] who interpreted\nit as a signature akin to a TCR, similar to the signature shown\nin Figure 2.\n[33] Turning to the SKR data in Figure 4a, we note that,\nsimilar to example B above, there is relatively constant\nemission in the \u0001100\u2013400 kHz band. However, there is a\nvery strong burst of intense emission (peaking at 1.0 \n\n1010 W sr\b1), coupled with an extension to lower frequency\non day 193 starting at \u00010600 UT and lasting for several\nhours. This peak is three orders of magnitude larger than the\naverage power for the preceding day and occurs before\nthe expected phasing illustrated by the vertical dashed lines\nin Figure 4b. Following this burst the SKR emissions fade\nto levels as low as \u00011 \n 106 W sr\b1 until a second burst just\nbefore \u00012000 UT on day 193 with extension to lower\nfrequencies, and peaking at 5.5 \n 109 Wsr\b1. Once more,\nthe emissions fade in the day following this event. Could\nthese be more examples of radio emissions following\ncompression-induced magnetic reconnection? We cannot\nconclusively say without the benefit of an upstream solar\nwind monitor, but the SKR emissions are certainly highly\nsuggestive of a strong magnetospheric process whereby\nquiet radio emissions are suddenly interrupted by a very\nlarge burst of SKR. In Figure 4b, we have again plotted an\nerror bar surrounding the interval which we suggest matches\nthe timing of the reconnection event that produced the\nplasmoid. For a reconnection site at 30 RS and a plasmoid\ntraveling at 800 km\/s to meet the spacecraft, we solve for an\nevent time of 0706.24 UT on day 193. This time closely\ncoincides with the center of the first radio emission burst.\n3.4. Overall Correlation of SKR and Reconnection\nEvents\n[34] These three examples combine to suggest a relation-\nship between substorm-like events and strong bursts of SKR\nFigure 4. RPWS and MAG data from day 192\u2013195, 2006, in the same format as Figure 2.\nA08211 JACKMAN ET AL.: LOWER-FREQUENCY RADIO EMISSIONS AT SATURN\n8 of 13\nA08211\nwith extensions of the spectrum to lower frequencies. The\nlow-frequency extensions are likely caused by accelerated\nelectrons precipitating into the auroral zone, leading to an\nextension of the acceleration region and expansion of radio\nsources to higher altitudes. Table 1 summarizes the rela-\ntionship between the nine substorm-like reconnection\nevents that have been identified thus far from the magne-\ntometer data and their corresponding radio emissions. The\nfirst example is from the outbound pass of SOI [Bunce et\nal., 2005], and the other eight from the equatorial tail orbits\nof 2006. The three case studies shown above are indicated\nby asterisks. In general, there is a good correlation between\nthe timing of a reconnection event and the observation of\nenhanced SKR. Further, most examples display some evi-\ndence of low-frequency extension of the spectrum, although\nthe degree to which this is apparent varies.\n[35] We also consider how these enhanced bursts fit with\nthe planetary-modulated phasing of the SKR peaks. Do all\nthe magnetic field signatures occur in phase with regular\nmodulations, indicating that they may be driven by plane-\ntary-period oscillations, or if out of phase, does this suggest\ncompression-induced tail reconnection? The fourth column\nof Table 1 shows the SKR phase, as defined by Kurth et al.\n[2008], at the inferred time of each of the reconnection\nevents \u2018\u2018R,\u2019\u2019 where 0 and 360\u0001 correspond to expected SKR\nmaximum, and 180\u0001 to SKR minimum. Eight of the nine\nevents are clustered in the phase range of 195\u2013360\u0001, which\nis the sector of the SKR cycle where the power is expected\nto be rising with time on average. Thus the reconnection\nbursts appear to be associated with intervals where the\nprocess leading to SKR maxima is growing with time.\nConsequently, we suggest a substorm model in which\nmagnetic flux accumulates in the tail for some \u00015\u20137 days\n[Jackman et al., 2004] to the point of some instability, but\nthat instability is then favored at a particular phase of the\nplanetary rotation.\n[36] Despite many years of study into the terrestrial\nsubstorm-AKR correlation, and a wealth of spacecraft data,\nnot every substorm is found to be linked to enhanced AKR\nemission. Morioka et al. [2007] derived statistics on the\npercentage of terrestrial substorms that provoked a change\nin the frequency of radio emission (where a substorm was\nknown to have occurred). They found that 69% of examples\nrevealed a dual- or wide-source AKR population, indicating\nthat the appearance of a new AKR source region on a\nhigher-altitude auroral field line is a common (but not\nubiquitous) feature at substorm onset and that even the\nAKR is not a perfect indicator of substorm activity. The\nvisibility effects associated with SKR analysis were intro-\nduced in section 2.1, and below we study the extensions of\nthe spectrum to lower-frequency in a statistical manner, to\naid us in deciphering the nature of the correlation with\nreconnection on both a general and a case-by-case basis.\n4. Survey of Radio Emissions and Low-Frequency\nExtensions\n[37] L08 presented a detailed statistical study of the\ngeneral character of the bulk SKR emissions over 2.75 years\nsince SOI. However, here we focus our attention on the\nextensions to low frequency in the SKR spectrum and study\ntheir typical characteristics. We first derive two strict criteria\nto define a \u2018\u2018low-frequency extension\u2019\u2019 or LFE. We are\ninterested in strong, continuous extensions of the emission\nto lower frequencies, as described above, and akin to the type\nof behavior observed for the AKR by Morioka et al. [2007,\n2008], as distinct from the narrowband n-SMR and n-SKR\nemissions mentioned in section 2.2 which are produced by\nmechanisms other than the CMI. Consequently, we apply two\ncriteria to define an LFE as follows: First, flux densities\nabove a threshold of 1\n 10\b25Wm\b2 Hz\b1 (scaled to 1 AU)\nmust be present in the lower-frequency channels from 6.95 to\n37.75 kHz). This represents emission 3 orders of magnitude\nabove the mean and so corresponds to intense bursts. Second,\nthe extension of the spectrum down to these lower frequen-\ncies must be continuous, i.e., no gaps in the spectrum\nbetween the lower-frequency emissions and the main SKR\nband (frequencies of 10.12\u2013205.027 kHz). This ensures that\nperiods we identify as LFEs are genuine extensions of the\nmain auroral SKR spectrum, ruling out anomalous \u2018\u2018blips\u2019\u2019\nand the narrowband emissions n-SMR and n-SKRmentioned\nabove.\n[38] For this work, we have studied several cases of in\nsitu reconnection events and their associated SKR signa-\ntures. By the nature of the reconnection process, we expect\nplasmoids to be released and travel close to the center of the\ncurrent sheet. Thus our search for magnetic signatures of\nreconnection is largely confined to the equatorial plane. By\nlooking statistically at the spread of LFEs during a period\nwhen we know there are several energetic reconnection\nTable 1.

Do\nKronian substorms trigger bursts of SKR which extend to\nlow frequency, or do precipitating electrons associated with\nreconnection merely alter the beaming of the radio emission\nsuch that it is more easily visible from certain spacecraft\npositions?\n[39] Figures 5a and 5b show data from the portion of the\nCassini orbit from 2005 day 251 to 2006 day 203, during\nwhich time the spacecraft latitude never exceeded \u00b10.4\u0001. It\nwas during these equatorial orbits that eight of the nine\nobserved magnetic signatures of reconnection and associated\nplasmoids occurred. Thus, by analyzing the spread of LFE\nobservations during this period as a subset of the nominal\nmission (2004\u20132008), we eliminate the effects of increased\nlatitude on our statistics, and we are able to gain a better\ninsight into how LFE visibility is affected by radial distance\nand local time effects in the equatorial plane.\n[40] Figure 5a shows the Cassini trajectory for the inter-\nval above in the equatorial plane in KSM (cylindrical)\ncoordinates with dotted lines for every 1 h of LT. The\nRPWS data over this period are at 180 s resolution. For\nevery 2 h interval (40 points), the number of measurements\nfulfilling the LFE criteria as outlined above is recorded, and\nplotted as a dot reflecting the percentage of the number of\nSKR measurements in that period (always 40 assuming no\ndata gaps). These dots are coded according to the legend on\nthe left of the plots, such that periods with a small\npercentage of LFEs observed are in pale gray, with shades\ngetting progressively darker toward black as the visibility\/\noccurrence of the LFEs increases. Dots are omitted for\nperiods where no LFEs were observed, so just the thin\nblack trajectory trace is plotted during these intervals.\nFigure 5b shows histograms of the percentage of emissions\nthat fulfill the low-frequency criteria as a function of radial\nrange, LT, and subsolar longitude [Kurth et al., 2008].\nOverplotted by dashed lines are the histograms of trajectory\ninformation, i.e., the percentage of time spent in each RS or\nradial range, each hour of LT, and each 3\u0001 wide sector of\nlongitude.\nFigure 5.

During\nthis period, the spacecraft covered a wide range of radial\ndistances on the nightside out to a maximum of >68 RS on\none orbit. The dayside excursions were limited to within\n20 RS of the planet. However, it is the local time effects\nthat are most striking with a clear dawn-dusk asymmetry.\nThe vast proportion of time was spent in the 0\u201310 h LT\nrange, with only a small number of orbits exploring the\ndusk flank and an even smaller number in the post-noon\nsector at small radial distances. This scant sampling of the\ndusk magnetosphere at large radial distances will have an\nimpact on the distribution of LFEs described by our\nstatistics.\n[42] L08 studied the full SKR emissions for \b1\u0001 \u000b lSC \u000b\n+1\u0001. They found that intense events with a broad spectrum\nare preferentially observed when the spacecraft is located\nbetween 0200 and 1100 h, and that SKR is preferentially\nobserved from the morning side, with maximum intensity\nand bandwidth between 0200 and 0800 h LT. The statistics\nfor radial distance in Figure 5b (top) show a wide spread in\nLFE visibility. Cassini spent on average less than 20% of its\ntime in each of the 1 RS-wide bins in the radial range of\n\u000120\u201330 RS, equating to less than 10% of the total period\nspent sampling this 10 RS wide region. However, the\nnumber of LFEs observed from this area is significantly\nlarger than the orbital biasing would suggest. There are\nseveral large peaks in LFE occurrence at 21\u201322, 25\u201326 and\n28\u201329 RS in particular, each peaking at 8% or above. The\ndeep tail passes, particularly in the 61\u201365 RS range, also\nhave a large incidence of LFEs.\n[43] The LT spread also has some striking features,\nincluding the spike in the 0900\u20131000 h LT range, with\nLFEs being observed from here almost twice as often as in\nany other local time sector. There is also a curious drop in\nthe occurrence frequency of LFEs in the 0100\u20130200 h LT\nrange. As mentioned above, and as is clear from Figure 5b\n(middle), Cassini\u2019s trajectory thus far has been biased such\nthat it had only limited exploration of the dusk magneto-\nsphere and a wide spread over the dawn sector. The\nstatistics are not inconsistent with the results of L08 for\nthe bulk SKR emission but further exploration of the dusk-\nside will help to better constrain visibility at all local times\nthroughout the magnetosphere.\n[44] Figure 5b (bottom) shows the spread in subsolar\nlongitude of the LFE observations (solid line) and the\ntrajectory itself (dashed line). Clearly the spacecraft samples\nall longitudes equally, so thus any biasing in the LFE\nhistogram is a pure visibility effect. We note the on average\nhigher occurrence frequency between \u000145 and 180\u0001, with\nthe largest peak centered around 110\u0001 in a 3\u0001-wide bin. This\nis consistent with the phasing of SKR in general, in which\nSKR power maximizes near 100\u0001 longitude.\n[45] Overall, the spread of the LFEs appears to be similar\nto the spread of the bulk SKR emission, without any\nsignificant changes in visibility that may be linked in a\nstraightforward manner to beaming effects. Thus we may\ninterpret the LFEs in the way introduced in section 1.3, as\nrepresenting expansions of the radio sources to higher\naltitudes along field lines.\n5. Discussion and Conclusions\n[46] In this paper, we have examined three case studies of\nin situ reconnection events in the Kronian magnetotail and\ntheir corresponding SKR signatures. For the examples\nshown, there is a good correlation between magnetic sig-\nnatures of plasmoid passage and intense bursts of radio\nemission with extension to lower frequencies. The lower-\nfrequency emission is a direct consequence of the extension\nof the source regions to higher altitudes, estimated up to\n4 RS, following strong energetic particle precipitation which\ncan be driven by substorm-like events.\n[47] Using magnetometer data, we have observed nine\nmagnetic signatures of reconnection events in Saturn\u2019s\nmagnetotail thus far. Comparing the timings of the recon-\nnection events with the phasing of the SKR, we note that\neight of the nine examples occur during the expected rising\nphase of the SKR cycle, which indicates the link between\nthese events and planetary-period modulations. We suggest\nthat Kronian substorms are a much more prevalent phe-\nnomenon than this small number of observations suggests,\nbut our statistics are hampered by viewing geometries,\nnamely the small amount of time that Cassini spent in the\ndeep magnetotail near the nominal current sheet location.\nThe three case studies we have shown represent examples\nwith a good correlation; however, this is not the case for all\nevents.\n[48] When comparing solar wind compressions with SKR\nsignatures while Cassini was upstream of Saturn, Badman et\nal. [2008] found that intensifications of SKR coincident\nwith magnetospheric compressions were almost ubiquitous\nbut that features such as \u2018\u2018extra\u2019\u2019 peaks in the SKR spectrum\nand broadening of the emission were highly variable. We\nfind that in eight of nine cases there is a good match\nbetween plasmoid timings and intensification of the SKR,\nhowever the degree of low-frequency extension is variable.\nWe note here that while AKR intensifications have been\nused for many years as a proxy for terrestrial substorm\nactivity [e.g., Gurnett, 1974; Voots et al., 1977], they are\nstill not a perfect indicator, in part due to diurnal modulation\n(L. Lamy et al., manuscript in preparation, 2009). Moreover,\nthe LFEs we are searching for in the Kronian data set are a\ncommon but not ubiquitous feature of the terrestrial data set.\nMorioka et al. [2007] noted that the statistically derived\nprobability of a dual- or wide-source AKR spectrum at\nsubstorm onset is \u000170%. Anderson et al. [1997, 1998]\nnoted that where low-frequency extensions of the AKR\nspectrum are seen, they are almost always accompanied by\nsubstorm onset. Certainly many examples of LFEs are\nobserved by Cassini from a wide set of vantage points,\nbut the spacecraft is only in the right position to observe the\ncorresponding magnetic signature (if any) a fraction of the\ntime. We suggest that the timescales for loading the tail with\nsufficient flux to trigger a substorm-like event are of the\norder of \u00015\u20137 days but that the subsequent release of this\nenergy occurs at a preferential phase of the planetary\nrotation.\n[49] Section 4 discussed the spread of LFEs in range,\nlatitude, and local time. Latitude effects have been shown to\nA08211 JACKMAN ET AL.: LOWER-FREQUENCY RADIO EMISSIONS AT SATURN\n11 of 13\nA08211\nbe a major factor when studying the visibility of both\nnarrowband emissions and the bulk SKR spectrum. How-\never, we do not explore the effects of latitude on LFE\nvisibility here. Rather with reference to Figure 5 we discuss\nan interval from 2005 day 251 to 2006 day 203 where\nCassini sampled the equatorial plane at latitudes \u000bj0.4\u0001j,\nand during which time the magnetometer instrument\ndetected several plasmoids traveling down the magnetotail.\nAs outlined above, dawn-dusk asymmetries in the orbital\ncoverage mean that the dusk magnetosphere remains largely\nunsampled, and thus it is not possible to make general\nconclusions about the occurrence or otherwise of LFEs in\nthis region. In the absence of direct measurements, we can\nhowever make some hypotheses based on theory as to what\nkind of signatures may be observed in the dusk magneto-\nsphere. At Saturn, Cowley et al. [2004] have modeled the\nVasyliunas- and Dungey-cycle flows. In their theoretical\npicture, the combination of these processes makes magnetic\nreconnection more likely in the midnight to predawn sector\nof the magnetotail. Further theoretical work presented by\nCowley et al. [2005] suggests that due to the spiral structure\nof the lobe field, reconnection events occurring in the center\nof the tail will map magnetically to later local times in the\nionosphere. Thus, if magnetotail reconnection occurs more\noften in the midnight to predawn sector as opposed to the\nduskside, and if the associated field lines map to later local\ntimes in the ionosphere, we may expect this effect to be\nmanifested in the auroral and radio response.\n[50] In this paper we have demonstrated the strong\ncorrelation between substorm-like reconnection events and\nextensions of the SKR spectrum to lower frequencies.\nFurther Cassini orbits in the deep magnetotail during the\nCassini solstice mission beginning in 2010 should provide\nus with more magnetic signatures to analyze, while future\norbits on the dusk flank will help to further constrain\nvisibility issues relating to the main SKR spectrum and\nLFEs. Future work will also investigate both the durations\nand recurrence rates of LFEs with a view to placing them in\nthe physical context of the longer intrinsic timescales of the\nKronian flux addition and closure cycle.\n[51] Acknowledgments.
