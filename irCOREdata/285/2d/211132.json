From humanism to scepticism: the\nindependent traveller in the\nseventeenth century\nSAMUEL PURCHAS AND THE COSMOGRAPHICAL\nPILGRIMAGE\nThe English parson Samuel Purchas (1577\u20131626) is best known as the\nsuccessor of Richard Hakluyt for the massive twenty books of his\nPilgrimes (London, 1625), in which he collected the travel accounts of all\ntimes \u2018not by one professing methodically to deliver the historie of nature\naccording to rules of art, nor philosophically to discuss and dispute; but\nas in a way of discourse, by each traveller relating what in that kind he\nhath seene\u2019.1 The distinction between methodical exposition according to\ngeneral analytical headings, and the original narratives of the travellers\nusing their own words \u2018in a way of discourse\u2019, was one crucial to the\nculture of the late Renaissance, especially in England, and supported the\nnew ideas of scientific method developed by contemporaries of Purchas\nlike Francis Bacon.2 Purchas himself explained this when he defined his\ntravel collection as a kind of natural history: \u2018As David prepared\nmaterials for Solomon\u2019s temple; or (if that be too arrogant) as Alexander\nfurnished Aristotle with huntsmen and observers of creatures to acquaint\nhim with their diversified natures; or (if that also seeme too ambitious) as\nsense, by induction of particulars, yeeldeth the premisses to reasons\nsyllogisticall arguing . . . so here Purchas and his pilgrimes minister\nindividuall and sensible materials (as it were stones, bricks and mortar)\nto those universal speculators to their theoreticall structures\u2019.3 The point\nwas not simply to distinguish the empirical observations of the traveller\nand the general theories of the scholar, but rather to bring critical skills\n349\n1 Samuel Purchas, Hakluytus posthumus; or, Purchas his pilgrimes (London, 1625), \u2018To the\nreader\u2019.\n2 I have discussed this in \u2018Instructions for travellers: teaching the eye to see\u2019, pp. 139\u201390.\n3 Purchas,Hakluytus, \u2018To the reader\u2019.\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n350 TRAVEL AND ETHNOLOGY IN THE RENAISSANCE\nto the distance that separated them, under the guise of methodical\nawareness.\nUnlike Bacon, Purchas was personally less interested in methodical\nawareness than in the shape of the temple he wished to build. Critics\nhave often emphasized how imperfect were many of the summaries and\ntranslations of travel accounts which he laboriously prepared, especially\nin contrast with those of his predecessor Richard Hakluyt, who (possibly\ninspired by Ramusio\u2019s high standards of editorial fidelity) was careful to\nreproduce his documents word by word. Whilst Purchas has often been\ndefended on the grounds that he made available much new material in\nprint, what perhaps needs to be emphasized is that his project was more\ntheoretical than empirical.4 Before being a collector of \u2018pilgrimes\u2019, he was\na pilgrim himself \u2013 not one who physically travelled around the world,\nbut rather a Cambridge-educated theologian who travelled by reading\nbooks from his study, with the aim of reaching that particular location\nexpressed by his motto \u2018unus deus, una veritas\u2019. Purchas\u2019s collection of\n\u2018sensible materials\u2019 was not therefore the primary focus of his work: of\ngreater importance was the theological\u2013geographical temple of the whole\nworld which he had built in his mind. This found expression in his\nmassive Pilgrimage, or relations of the world and the religions observed in\nall ages and places discovered from the creation unto this present. This\nearlier work (not to be confused with the Pilgrimes) was first published in\n1613 and dedicated to the archbishop of Canterbury, George Abbot, a\ncircumstance which secured for Purchas a chaplaincy to the archbishop,\nand shortly afterward a rectory in London.5\nPurchas can be seen as a true successor to the author of the book by\nSir John Mandeville \u2013 which helps explains why, suspending his critical\nfaculties, he insisted on Mandeville\u2019s status as a great traveller. He was\nalso the Protestant counterpart to Giovanni Botero (though probably\nnot his emulator, since only the political sections of the Relationi\nuniversali were available in English when Purchas conceived his project).\nPurchas\u2019 Pilgrimage was essentially a universal cosmography based on all\nthe travel literature he could lay his hands on, guided by the desire to\ndefine the place of newly discovered religious diversity in a Christian\n4 The bibliography concerning Purchas is scarce. See, however, E. G. R. Taylor, Late\nTudor and early Stuart geography, 1583\u20131650 (London, 1934), pp. 53\u201366. The recent\npublication of The Purchas Handbook, edited by L. E. Pennington, Hakluyt Society, 2nd\nseries, 2 vols. (London, 1997), provides essential reference material and will help rectify a\ntraditional historiographical neglect.\n5 Published again with additions in 1614 and 1617. The fourth edition of the Pilgrimage, or\nrelations of the world appeared in 1626 appended to the Hakluytus posthumus. It benefited\nfrom the papers collected by Hakluyt, which after his death Purchas managed to acquire\ndespite Hakluyt\u2019s antipathy towards him.\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\nThe independent traveller in the seventeenth century\nframework, and supported by a world-historical perspective which\ninevitably rested on biblical and classical foundations. \u2018Religion is my\nmore proper aime\u2019, he declared, and his theme was that whilst all men\nagreed \u2018that there should bee a Religion\u2019, they disagreed in their practice\nof it. He distinguished of course between the many heathen superstitions\nof Asia, Africa and America, and the \u2018true\u2019 religion of Christians alone \u2013\nby which he meant the Protestants and especially those from Great\nBritain, who thus stood as a new Israel among pagans. Catholics Purchas\nrhetorically equated with gentile idolaters, and found standard argu-\nments for this equation in the similarity he detected between popish rites\nand those of the ancient Chaldeans and Egyptians. Not only were\nCatholics drinking from the original fountains of paganism, they were\nalso surpassed by the gentiles in their devotions (and here Purchas could\nquote the very Jesuits as witnesses to the asceticism of the devilish Indian\nyogis, thus taking the wind out of their own claims to sanctity).\nBoth Purchas\u2019s ideological stance and his method had important\nimplications that are revealing of the tension between humanism and\nscepticism which characterized the seventeenth century. In this light\nPurchas in fact appears as a man of medieval aims and modern\nperspectives. The ideological implications are particularly obvious: in\norder to maintain his claims in favour of Christianity, Purchas needed\nboth to cleanse it from any superstition which might be seen as idolatrous\n\u2013 as Protestants insisted when they criticized Catholics \u2013 and to justify\nhis claims historically with a critical scrutiny of revelation. This could,\nhowever, only lead to the infinite search for an impossible point of\necclesiastical purity, a process which effectively condemned seventeenth-\ncentury Protestantism to further fragmentation, and to the ultimate\ndisintegration of the authority of the Bible from an antiquarian critical\nperspective (which implied a historicization of the Jewish sources of\nChristian revelation). What made this process uncontrollable was not\nonly the implicit challenge of authority which followed from any open\nact of reformation, but also the fact that the defence of the truth of\nChristianity necessitated the monogenistic assumption of the unity of\nmankind, expressed in Purchas\u2019s thesis that the religious instinct was\nuniversal. He needed to exclude atheism as an effective possibility. The\nempirical evidence of gentile idolatry was therefore an argument against\nscepticism, and justified the reader\u2019s journey through the ugly face of its\nmultiplicity \u2013 but it could be challenged if Europeans declared themselves\natheists, or if they successfully proved that gentiles in China were so.\nArguments about natural religion and atheism, like the related arguments\nabout the age of the world or about the origins of the American Indians,\ncame to dominate the seventeenth century because of their theological\n351\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n352 TRAVEL AND ETHNOLOGY IN THE RENAISSANCE\nimplications. There was nothing that men like Purchas could do to bury\na debate that their own antiquarian perspective made inevitable, and\nwhich effectively led to the Socinian and vaguely deist beliefs of the\nEnlightenment.\nIn this ideological context, the importance of Purchas\u2019s work really lay\nin the method which he had proclaimed of giving the voice of truth to the\nindividual travellers, and then trying to arrange their observations into a\ncoherent whole. The often noted imperfections of Purchas\u2019s own labor-\nious execution are really secondary. In the Pilgrimage the material was\nmethodically organized in a massive synthesis so as to cover all places\nand then, within each place, to offer a full historical sequence organized\naccording to the chronology of travellers\u2019 reports. Unfortunately, the\nstaggering multiplicity of the sources, combined with Purchas\u2019s personal\nlimitations, meant that in reality this universal history of religion was\nrepetitious and often failed to maintain a steady chronological progres-\nsion. The example of \u2018the kingdome of Narsinga and Bisnagar\u2019 is again\nperfectly illustrative.6 No writer before Purchas had assembled so much\nfrom so many writers about this kingdom \u2013 in this sense his account\nstands as the true culmination of the process started by Conti and Poggio\n200 years earlier, when they joined together the authorities of empirical\ntraveller and secular humanist to place \u2018Bizengalia\u2019 on the European map\nof the world. Purchas thus combined modern authors like Barros,\nOso\u00b4rio, Federici, Botero, Linschoten, Floris and Balbi, even Jesuit\nauthorities like du Jarric, with older writers like Pordenone, Mandeville,\nConti and Varthema. His account ranged from the earliest European\nreports of South Indian rites and customs to the latest Jesuit descriptions\nof the court of Venkata II or the nayakas of Gingee and Madurai.\nHowever, although he described the location of Bisnagar and the power\nof its kings, his aim was not to offer a proper history of the kingdom, but\nsimply to describe its religion as idolatrous and cruel, to emphasize the\npower of brahmins as sectarian and ridicule their beliefs about the\ncreation of the world, and to locate the Christian legend of Saint Thomas\nin this heathen landscape. He was essentially following the Jesuits here,\nand he even described Nobili\u2019s discoveries and disputations, not really\naware of the controversial implications of his method.\nWhilst Purchas failed in his attempt to synthesize his material effec-\ntively, he in fact returned the authority of discourse to the individual\nauthors whose accounts he used, first within the structure of the\nPilgrimage, and then, more clearly, in his continuation of Hakluyt\u2019s task\nwith the Pilgrimes. That massive body of evidence, like the sixteenth-\n6 Purchas, Pilgrimage, book V, chap. 11.\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\nThe independent traveller in the seventeenth century\ncentury collections which inspired him, and like those others which were\npublished later in the seventeenth century (notably the Relations de divers\nvoyages curieux by Melchise\u00b4dech The\u00b4venot in France), emerged now as a\nkey instrument for the philosopher in Europe. In this way the historical\nperspective created by the antiquarian scholarship of humanist cosmo-\ngraphers and theologians fell increasingly into the hands of the rationalist\nphilosopher, with his own secular approach to the questions of man-\nkind\u2019s role in creation, of the very character of creation, and even of the\nanthropological nature of religious beliefs.\nWhat is perhaps most important is that the humanist philosopher was\nnot simply competing against the clerical authorities for the interpret-\nation of merchant accounts and missionary letters, with their peculiar\nlimitations of perspective: he was also often travelling to the East, as a\nmerchant-humanist, as a gentleman-humanist or even as an educated\nadventurer. The legacy of the travel literature of the Renaissance to the\nseventeenth-century transformation of the European discourse on\nhuman diversity therefore needs to be analysed at two levels: as a change\nin the quality of the secular gaze of the authoritative observer, and as a\nchange in the assumptions that governed the ethnological debate, from\nan essentially theological language towards a fully secular understanding\nof nature and history. In the following pages I shall seek to illustrate\nthese two themes through the remarkable example of the Italian traveller\nPietro della Valle (1586\u20131652). In his concrete ideological context, della\nValle stands as a lay example of that Roman Catholic synthesis of the\nbaroque age which, as we saw when discussing Nobili, unwittingly\nmediated between the chivalric piety of the Counter-Reformation and\nthe corrosive distinctions of an increasingly analytical historical dis-\ncourse. But as representative of a type, his significance is larger: he is also\na counter-figure to the armchair cosmographer, Protestant or Catholic.\nBy revealing the open-ended character of the antiquarian project by\nmeans of his own reflective gaze, the educated traveller eroded the\nauthority of writers like Botero and Purchas, and especially their\ntheological bias, in ways that would eventually elude the controls of any\nparticular system of ideological censorship.\nPIETRO DELLA VALLE AND THE PILGRIMAGE OF\nHUMANIST WISDOM\nI carried with me from Persia a great desire to go to Cambay because\nof what I had heard about it, having been told that in that city, which\nis one of the most ancient of India, the gentile people are very\nnumerous and beyond measure observant of their rites, so that there\n353\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n354 TRAVEL AND ETHNOLOGY IN THE RENAISSANCE\nmore than anywhere else I would be able to see many fine curiosities\n[belle curiosita\u00c1 ] of these idolaters.7\nWith this unambiguous declaration of intellectual curiosity, the\nRoman aristocrat Pietro della Valle introduced in a letter of 1623 his\nexpedition from the Dutch factory at Surat (where despite being Catholic\nhe was kindly hosted as a gentleman-traveller) towards the mysterious\ncustoms, rites and temples of gentile India. Pietro della Valle was\nparticularly aware of the diversity of oriental nations and religions, and\nof the distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims, since he had\nalready spent more than eight years travelling in the dominions of the\nOttoman Turks and at the court of the Persian Shah Abbas.8 He learnt\n7 Viaggi di Pietro della Valle il pellegrino descritti da liu medesimo in lettere familiari\nall\u2019erudito suo amico Mario Schipano. Parte terza, cioe\u00c1 l\u2019India, co\u2019l ritorno alla patria\n(Rome, 1663), p. 36 (hereafter India). This is part of the first complete and more reliable\nedition of the Viaggi, published in Rome by Biagio Deversin between 1658 and 1663,\nincluding: part II concerning Persia, in two volumes (1658); a second edition of part I\nconcerning Turkey (1662); finally part III concerning India (1663). The printers were\nVitale Mascardi and (for the second printing) Iacomo Dragondelli. The first part, the\nletters from Turkey, had been previously published in 1650 by della Valle himself before\nhis death. However, only the 1662 reprint also includes the life of della Valle by Giovan\nPietro Bellori, and an engraving of the author (drawn during his lifetime). There is no\nmodern critical edition of the Italian text, except for the first volume of the second part,\nconcerning Persia, which was published as I viaggi di Pietro della Valle. Lettere dalla\nPersia, vol. I, ed. by F. Gaeta and L. Lockhart (Rome, 1972) (hereafter Lettere dalla\nPersia). I have used this superior text for quotations from this section. One of the\ncontributions of this excellent edition is the restoration of passages suppressed by\necclesiastical censorship because they dealt with Christian theology or missionary policy,\nfrom the clean copy of the letters prepared for the publishers by della Valle, and now kept\nin the Societa` Geografica Italiana (as already noted in I. Ciampi, Della vita e delle opera di\nPietro della Valle il Pellegrino (Rome, 1880); however della Valle died before he could\nsupervise the edition of the Indian letters). Even more valuable, however, is the original\njournal of della Valle covering the years 1616\u201326, from which he then wrote the letters\nwhich he sent to Mario Schipano in Naples, with small alterations. I have consulted this\njournal (Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana (BAV), Ms. Ottob. 3,382) for the sections on\nIndia, and have been able to ascertain that on the whole della Valle simply copied a chunk\nof his journal each time he wrote to Schipano, adding, however, an introductory\nparagraph, and including the marginalia. The journal includes words and inscriptions in\noriental languages not found in the printed edition, but on the whole the published letters\n(excepting censored passages) represented the journal as he wrote it. In English there\nexists the generally reliable early translation by George Havers (1664), edited and\nannotated for the Hakluyt Society as The travels of Pietro della Valle in India from the old\nEnglish translation of 1664 by G. Havers, ed. by E. Grey, 2 vols. (London, 1892). The\nmodern version by George Bull (ed) The pilgrim. The travels of Pietro della Valle\n(London, 1990), improves Grey\u2019s translation but unfortunately is only an abridgement. I\nhave benefited from these translations for my own and, as indicated, I have occasionally\nfollowed George Bull\u2019s.\n8 Della Valle began his travels in 1614 as a pilgrim in order to forget a frustrated love. After\nvisiting Constantinople and Egypt, he crossed Palestine towards Syria, fulfilling his\npilgrimage to the Holy Land. However, instead of going back home he turned towards\nBaghdad in 1616, where he married. He went on to Isfahan, and spent the next six years\nin Persia (January 1617 to January 1623). He finally went on to Surat and then to Goa in\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\nThe independent traveller in the seventeenth century\nsome Arabic and spoke Turkish and Persian fluently, copied ancient\ninscriptions, collected oriental manuscripts, dug up Egyptian mummies,\nresearched Arabic science, translated or even composed Persian litera-\nture, and dressed according to the custom of each place. In Baghdad he\nhad also fallen in love with and married Sitti Maani Joerida, a Syrian\nChristian woman (Arabic-speaking and Nestorian) from a well-estab-\nlished family. After her tragic death in Persia, he carried with him her\nembalmed body, in order to bury it later with due aristocratic pomp in\nhis native Rome.9\nThere could be no doubt for the European reader of della Valle\u2019s fifty-\nfour long and detailed letters, which were originally published in Italian\nin the middle of the seventeenth century, that he was an uncommon\ntraveller.10 Self-styled \u2018the pilgrim\u2019, his pilgrimage was decisively a\npilgrimage of curiosity. However, unlike the adventurer Varthema who\nhad preceded him by over more than a century, he was not an obscure\nfigure with unclear aims who had picked up his rhetoric of self-fashioning\nfrom echoes of humanist intellectual culture: rather, della Valle was a\ntruly well-educated gentleman, with connections with the Roman court,\nIndia, which he used as a base to visit the gentile petty courts of Ikkeri and Olala. In\n1624 he began his return journey, reaching Rome in 1626 through the Middle East and\nsouthern Italy.\n9 Della Valle met his \u2018Babylonian\u2019 bride in the autumn of 1616, when she was eighteen,\nand (although she was technically a Nestorian Christian) they married within a few\nweeks. In order to defeat his religious scruples della Valle noted that for Maani and her\nfamily Nestorianism was an ethnic identity rather than a doctrinal position, so that \u2018the\nbiggest error found among them today may well be ignorance\u2019. Her family followed della\nValle and Maani to Persia, but the attempt to settle a Syrian-Catholic Christian\ncommunity near Isfahan, under Rome\u2019s ecclesiastical authority, eventually failed.\nHaving decided to leave Persia, in 1621, and on the way to Hormuz, Maani fell ill and\ndied after a miscarriage. In order to transport her embalmed body, della Valle had to\nhide it from the crew of the English ship which took him to Surat. On his return to Rome\nhe published an account of her magnificent Christian burial (Nel funerale de Sitti Maani\nGioerida sua consorte, Rome, 1627). Soon afterwards he married (not without scandal in\nthe Roman court) Mariuccia, an orphan girl adopted in Persia by his former wife, and\nwho accompanied Pietro to India and Europe.\n10 Della Valle\u2019s letters, divided into three parts, were published in Rome long after his\nreturn in 1626. In 1650 the eighteen letters from \u2018Turkey\u2019, including all the Ottoman\ndominions appeared, in 1658 the eighteen letters from Persia, in two volumes because\nthey were longer, and in 1663, eighteen further letters from India, including the return\nhome. Thus the Persian and Indian letters were all published after della Valle\u2019s death in\n1652 by his sons. They suffered some cuts by the ecclesiastical censors. Originally della\nValle had arranged to send the letters regularly to his Neapolitan friend Mario Schipano,\nwho was supposed to edit them for publication (although he failed to do so). It is likely\nthat it was in order to avoid the rigid ecclesiastical censorship of baroque Rome that\ndella Valle, despite his social standing, delayed their publication on his return. The\nmanuscript della Valle prepared for the publisher was generally a faithful reproduction\nof his letters, which themselves followed faithfully his journal with the mere addition of\nsome introductory material.\n355\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n356 TRAVEL AND ETHNOLOGY IN THE RENAISSANCE\nand a man fully aware that he was creating his own myth as traveller\nfrom the social and religious values of the chivalric Renaissance and the\nCatholic Counter-Reformation. He did not hide behind his writing. His\nletters were in fact his carefully kept and extremely detailed journal,\nperiodically dispatched to a friend in Europe in large chunks. With their\npublication, Europe was no longer being offered just another contri-\nbution to the growing number of books of travels written by merchants,\nmissionaries and adventurers, which scholars like Botero and Purchas\ncould then collect and summarize: della Valle gave the European reader\nan authoritative lay voice which not only observed, but also discoursed,\nabout all the subjects of scientific curiosity of the age.11 Politics, religion,\nmanners, morality, music, food and dress, landscape, antiquities and\nnatural history were all open to the traveller\u2019s scrutiny, whose insights\ninto oriental matters were personal and, at the same time, informed by\nprevious reading (della Valle did not hesitate to correct written autho-\nrities in the light of his experience for the benefit of the empirical record).\nDella Valle was both the recorder and the interpreter of the East: his\nethnological language was no longer the spontaneous description of\ncustoms and rituals, nor was his religious discourse simply one of\nobservation and condemnation. Instead, della Valle compared and\nresearched, asked questions and listened to answers. Although he was\nnot really a thinker, although he never hinted at any identity other than\nthat of a Catholic Christian with a great deal of aristocratic self-\nimportance, and although his linguistic skills and observations were\noften still limited (which led him to a number of superficial judgements),\nthis self-styled pilgrim and citizen of the world opened his mind to both\nEuropeans and non-Europeans, Christians and non-Christians, Catholics\nand non-Catholics.12\n11 Possibly the closest model were the Latin letters of the Flemish humanist Ogier of\nBusbecq, ambassador of Emperor Ferdinand to the Ottoman court in 1555\u201362, which\nwere published through the 1580s as addressed to his friend Nicholas Michault (albeit in\na fictionalized, rhetorically elaborated form). A full version appeared in Leyden in 1633.\nFor the more recent scholarship see Z. R. W.

Della Valle, whose style is more\nspontaneous but less ironic, in effect belongs to a very different generation.\n12 I must therefore disagree with the judgement of J. D. Gurney, who in his otherwise\nexcellent article \u2018Pietro della Valle and the limits of perception\u2019, Bulletin of the School of\nOriental and African Studies, 49 (1986): 193\u2013216, argues for della Valle\u2019s subservience to\nconventional Renaissance stereotypes. Focusing on della Valle\u2019s crucial six-year Persian\nexperience, Gurney emphasizes the traveller\u2019s aristocratic self-fashioning as a reason for\nhis profound ethnocentrism, despite all his efforts to learn languages, so that only his\ncasual discovery of the heterodox and eclectic intellectual life of Lar in 1622 stands in\nopposition to a lack of cultural relativism in many of his previous observations.

Thus\nbreaking with a literary tradition which went back to the fourteenth\ncentury, he individualised her experience, recorded her words, and then\ncomposed for her a few sonnets.\nIn fact della Valle\u2019s conversation with Giaccama`, the Telugu sati of\nIkkeri, was the culmination of a desire to penetrate gentile India as a\npeculiar cultural reality. This desire had formed in Persia, inspired by\nhearsay and occasional contact with Indian merchants, especially Gu-\njarati Banians.13 It had been disciplined by the reading of ancient writers\nlike Strabo and Herodotus, so that when della Valle initiated his intensive\ntour of the temples of Cambay from his base at Surat he was ready to\ndevelop a theory of Hinduism based on the allegorical analogy between\nGraeco-Egyptian and brahminical doctrines. A visit to a \u2018hospital of\nbirds\u2019 was therefore not only an act of curiosity, but also illustrated the\nis certainly right in stating that della Valle\u2019s idealized politics were still those of a\ncrusader-missionary, and that his taste was fastidiously aristocratic according to Italian\nconventions (the fact that he could easily pay for his own travels over so many years is of\ncourse significant). However, it is inappropriate to stress \u2018thorough ethnocentrism\u2019 in\nsomeone who went as far as della Valle did in his attempt to understand sympathetically\nand with penetration people fom different religious backgrounds, with very few real\nprecedents in his own culture (Montaigne himself would have insisted that the evidence\nof cultural relativism was an argument for modestly keeping to one\u2019s own tradition,\nhowever flawed, rather than imagining that one could find better customs elsewhere).\nObviously it was not a matter for della Valle to gratuitously drop his Catholic militancy\naltogether, nor to look at other cultures from assumptions other than his own \u2013 in this\nsense his ethnocentrism was inevitable, and any question about \u2018limits of perception\u2019,\nrather than \u2018logic of perception\u2019, is bound to produce this result. What della Valle did\nthat was original was to often actually change his initial impressions through continuous\ncontact and curious conversation, something remarkable because, whilst all cultures are\nself-centred, not all of them are open to learning from the other. Della Valle\u2019s \u2018classical\nand Christian\u2019 lenses through which he viewed oriental societies (to use Gurney\u2019s apt\nmetaphor) did not blind him to the appreciation of diversity, because those lenses had a\nuniversalizing component as well as a parochial one. He sought for true nobility and true\nlove among foreigners \u2013 and, by implication, for the universal contents of civilization\nand knowledge. It was not a matter of putting his European lenses aside, but rather of\nusing them with an open mind, something which, from a comparative perspective, della\nValle cannot really be accused of having failed to accomplish.\n13 The Gujarati Banians (Vanias) were a very prominent elite group of Hindu and Jain\nmerchants.\n357\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n358 TRAVEL AND ETHNOLOGY IN THE RENAISSANCE\ngentiles\u2019 rigorous observation of superstitions according to a universal\nsystem of idolatry: \u2018for as the Indian gentiles, along with Pythagoras and\nthe ancient Egyptians (the first authors of this opinion, according to\nHerodotus), believe in the transmigration of souls, not only from man to\nman but also from man to brute beast, they account it no less a work of\ncharity to do good to animals than to men\u2019.14\nAs it turned out, della Valle\u2019s experience in Gujarat was only a\nprologue to his Indian experience. His analysis of Hinduism did not\ndepend on a single methodical exposition, but instead grew through the\nspontaneous observations of his journal, which he continued in southern\nIndia. By following this progression we can ascertain that the traveller\nallowed new experiences to alter his views. Thus in Goa della Valle was\nconfronted with the reality of an Indo-Portuguese society whose political\ndecline, as he had begun to suspect in Persia, did not tally with the image\ncreated by historians like Barros. Instead, he described a society with few\nreal Portuguese and many wretched naked slaves, a society whose\nostentatious, xenophobic and prudish attitudes (whether originally\nPortuguese, or perhaps specifically Indo-Portuguese, this he could not\nfully judge) the Italian sometimes found more alien and distasteful than\nthose of many oriental peoples.15 In contrast, his readiness to praise the\nDutch for their kindness and humanity suggests that a European identity\nbased on polite civility could be more powerful than one based on\nreligious confession.16\nParadoxically, this alienation from the Catholic Europeans in India\nstimulated della Valle to attempt a more intimate, subtler understanding\nof the oriental gentile. Goa in effect was an opportunity for a more\nambitious undertaking: to visit Indian gentiles in lands where their\nreligion could be observed in a pure state. It is striking the extent to\nwhich della Valle formulated this as his particular desire, in his own\nwords \u2018to see some land of the gentiles where they themselves have\ndominion and observe their rites without being subjected to Christians or\n14 Bull (ed.) The pilgrim, p. 222.\n15 Della Valle was upset in particular by the suspicion that fell over him for travelling with\nhis Georgian foster-daughter Mariuccia, a girl of about thirteen years old in 1623. They\nwere forced to live separately in Goa. He attributed this suspicion to the incestuous\nhabits of the Portuguese (della Valle, India, p. 119). Della Valle would, however, later\nmarry this same Mariuccia on his return to Rome, a decision which caused much\nsuspicion and disapproval amongst his aristocratic peers. She added fourteen children to\nhis already existing illegitimate issue.\n16 For his praise of the Dutch see ibid., p. 24. Despite his contempt for the Portuguese,\ndella Valle made many friends in Goa, a number of them priests, and also acted as\ninformer on Persian affairs to the viceroy, Don Francisco da Gama, who treated him\ncourteously. But he found as much fault with the unwise policies of the Portuguese in\nIndia as with their unrefined manners.\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\nThe independent traveller in the seventeenth century\nMuslims\u2019.17 A Portuguese embassy to the ruler of Ikkeri, Venkatapa\nNayaka, one of those military chiefs who had succeeded in establishing\nhis power on the ruins of the fragmented authority of Vijayanagara,\nproved the perfect opportunity for an expedition upcountry from\nHonavur across the mountains of northern Karnataka.18 This trip, and\nthe return through Mangalore in order to visit the queen of Olala (see\nmap 2), allowed della Valle to have a number of dialogues with the petty\nkings and queens of southern India, pitching his now well-developed\nidentity as a curious gentleman-traveller from Rome (in India he\nreturned to wearing European garb) against the humanity of gentile\nidolaters.\nI shall discuss three of these dialogues which are especially revealing of\nthe distance that separated della Valle from the practical aims of\nsixteenth-century travellers. The first one is the encounter with Venka-\ntapa. Although his growing influence above the Kanarese coast created\nproblems for the Portuguese, the modesty of his court could hardly\nrepresent a model of gentile kingship for an aristocrat whose immediate\nEuropean referents were the Papacy on the one hand and the Spanish\nmonarchy on the other, and whose oriental experiences had allowed him\nclosely to observe Ottoman and Persian grandeur in Constantinople and\nIsfahan. Della Valle\u2019s trip to Ikkeri thus constituted a confrontation with\nthe new dimensions of South Indian kingship. In his letter written from\nGoa in October 1623, before departing, he introduced this Indian ruler as\nthe local inheritor of Vijayanagara authority:\nThis prince Venkatapa` Naieka used to be a vassal and minister of the\ngreat king of Vidia`-Nagar [Vijayanagara], which the Portuguese\nimproperly call Bisnaga`. But after the fall of the king of Vidia`-Nagar,\nwho a few years ago, with his death, lost a great part of his state and\nwas almost extinguished (which was caused by wars raised against him\nby his neighbours), Venkatapa` Naieka, like many other nayakas who\nused to be his vassals and ministers, became absolute prince of that\npart of the state which he had under his care; which, because he is a\ngood soldier, he has increased a great deal, occupying the lands of\n17 Ibid., p. 135.\n18 The embassy of 1623 was motivated by the recent expansion of Ikkeri to the Kanarese\ncoast, where the Portuguese obtained much of their pepper in this period. Since 1569,\nexploiting the retreat of native power after the battle of Talikota, the Portuguese\ncontrolled the ports of Honavur, Barcelore and Mangalore. However, in 1618 their local\nallies (and some of their own troops) were defeated by the forces of Ikkeri. This forced\nthe Portuguese to send an ambassador, a former horse-trader called Joa\u02dco Fernandes\nLeita\u02dco, to seek an agreement with Venkatapa, who naturally wanted to sell the pepper at\na higher price and exploit a monopoly in his lands. Della Valle had befriended Leita\u02dco\nand was therefore able to accompany him.\n359\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n360 TRAVEL AND ETHNOLOGY IN THE RENAISSANCE\nMap 2 Pietro della Valle\u2019s journey to Ikkeri and Olala\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\nThe independent traveller in the seventeenth century\nmany other nayakas and petty princes who were his neighbours. With\nall this, his reputation has grown so much that, after also going to war\nagainst the Portuguese and giving them a good beating, now they not\nonly treat him as friend, and try to keep his friendship, but in order to\nconsolidate it they even send this embassy in the name of the king of\nPortugal.19\nWhat is striking about della Valle\u2019s account of this embassy is that his\ncontempt for the increasing weakness of the Portuguese (and their\ninflated chivalric rhetoric) was matched by his scepticism about Venkata-\npa\u2019s claims to kingship.20 The native ruler possessed no monumental\narmies, cities or palaces, but only modest towns and small forts. In fact,\nthe traveller\u2019s attention was increasingly diverted to the observation of\nthe landscape, which impressed him for its pastoral beauty.21 Della Valle\nalso explored with keen interest the temples and religious customs of the\nVirasaiva sect which predominated in those lands (the nayaka was\nhimself a lingayat). Whilst the natural and social setting of southern\nIndia came to life in the pages of his journal, della Valle\u2019s judgement of\nthe royal court became harsher:\nI call him king because the Portuguese themselves and the Indians in\nimitation do so, but in truth Venkatapa` Naieka does not deserve to be\ncalled king \u2013 not only because his predecessors were a few years ago\nvassals and simple Nayakas (that is feudatory princes, or rather\nprovincial governors under the king of Vijayanagara), so that today he\nreigns as absolute ruler by usurpation, and in effect he is no more than\na rebel . . . but also much more by reason of the small size of his\nterritory, however great it may be in comparison with that held by\nother Indian gentile princes . . . In short, Venkatapa` Naieka, although\nnow absolute, should in my opinion be called a petty king rather than\na king.22\n19 Della Valle, India, p. 138. At the time of della Valle\u2019s visit the eastern kingdom of\nVijayanagara, caught in a war of succession, no longer exercised authority in Kanara\u00b4.\n20 Despite the Portuguese tendency to portray their Asian opponents as kings and\nemperors, a tendency clearly reminiscent of chivalric romances, Venkatapa Nayaka had\n\u2018neither state, court nor appearance befitting a true king\u2019 (ibid., p. 154).\n21 The pastoral beauty of the landscape during the passage towards Gersoppa is admired as\n\u2018one of the most delightful journeys that I ever made in my life\u2019 (ibid., p. 158). Climbing\nthe Ghat, della Valle compares it favourably with the Italian Apennines, except for the\nfact that the latter are more urbanized and sumptuous, \u2018the Indian Ghat having no other\nbeauty besides what nature, liberal yet unpolished, gives it\u2019 (p.160). Whilst the\ncombination of \u2018city, lakes, fields and woods mingled together\u2019 made Ikkeri a very\npleasant town, with its dark and smallish houses it was not a model of urban civilization.\n22 Ibid., p. 177\u20138. It is certainly the case that the dynasty of Keladi chiefs from which\nVenkatapa descended did appropriate the claims to kingship of the Vijayanagara\ntradition throughout the seventeenth century, as exemplified in the Sanskrit poem\nSivatattvaratnakara, written c. 1709 by a member of the family, the Shaiva chief Keladi\n361\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n362 TRAVEL AND ETHNOLOGY IN THE RENAISSANCE\nThe arrival at the capital, and the first ceremonial audience, would\nonly confirm della Valle\u2019s ironic distance with respect to both the native\nruler and the embassy\u2019s aims. The travellers were taken through succes-\nsive gates to meet the king and his courtiers, towards a restricted space\nwhich was therefore symbolically defined as qualitatively superior.\nHowever, this message did not impress della Valle: \u2018all in all there were\nfew people, a small show and little wealth, signs which demonstrated the\nsmallness of this court and prince\u2019.23 His detailed description clearly\n\u2018decoded\u2019 the ceremonial exchange that followed as a symbolic inter-\naction, involving the creation of a shared language of honour through\nwhich power was both used and acquired. The real negotiations, which\ntook place behind the scenes, only confirmed what had been obvious\nthrough this ritual exchange: the Portuguese were being humiliated by an\nimpudent Indian chief. Della Valle believed that it was in fact their own\nfault: they lacked true knowledge of politics, and royal ministers like the\nambassador and former horse-trader Fernandes Leita\u02dco commonly\nlooked at their own interest rather than the interest of their state. The\nportrait of native pettiness was in effect also a portrait of Portuguese\ndecline.\nBut the fact that both partners of the exchange were undistinguished\ndid not disentangle della Valle from his own obligation personally to\nbehave according to a sophisticated sense of decorum. He carefully chose\nblack silk for his garments, to mark discretely his personal mourning for\nhis wife. If he willingly occupied the last place in the room (secretly\nlaughing within) it was only because he wanted to indulge the vanity of\nthe Portuguese. However, he made sure that his position as curious\nRoman traveller, who had been in the greatest courts of the East, was\nmade known. In fact the attention of the journal shifts from the embassy\nitself to the fact that della Valle, with his superior intellectual standpoint,\nwas observing native customs. He was able to determine the latitude of\nIkkeri and place it in the scientific map of the world. He was also\nrepeatedly invited to admire the dexterity of temple dancing girls (which\nhe did, although deploring their movements as either extravagant or\nlascivious), and the court was even disappointed when he failed to attend\na wrestling match.

Among other things, the poem described the construction of Ikkeri as a\nbeautiful and magnificent capital, and Venkatapa as a great warrior and religious, even\nliterary patron \u2013 in fact the perfect dharmic ruler. Modern historians accept that\nVenkatapa\u2019s rule (1602\u201329) was crucial for the consolidation of the royal claims of the\nnew dynasty.\n23 Della Valle, India, pp. 183\u20134.\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\nThe independent traveller in the seventeenth century\n1623, the traveller had effectively transformed his marginality as neutral\nobserver into a position of cultural authority, emerging as victor in a\nsymbolic contest which transcended its local context. The kings of both\nIndia and Spain, despite all their ritual trappings, had been de-mystified\nby his gaze.\nSimilar analyses may be applied to della Valle\u2019s encounters with the\nqueen of Olala and the king of Calicut. Any idea that the king was the\ncentre of a religious and political system \u2013 the idea which had sustained\nboth native and foreign descriptions of Vijayanagara from the Middle\nAges \u2013 was abandoned, and the figures in the landscape instead became\nhumanized. The meeting with the queen of Olala is of particular\nimportance because of the significance that della Valle attached to female\nfigures as inspiration for his romantic vision across cultures. Della Valle\nwas especially interested in codes of honour.24 Although he understood\nthat kingship in India was often through matrilineal succession, he did\nnot believe this to be in itself dishonourable (in fact he acknowledged\nthat the reason the natives gave, that matrilineal succession was more\nsecure, was surely correct). However, the strict observation of specific\ncaste rules he found less acceptable: in Calicut nayar women had as\nmany men as they pleased, in Ikkeri the king was expected to have\nvarious wives, and everywhere temple dancing girls were also public\nprostitutes.25\nThe queen of Olala represented another chance to meet an interesting\nfigure, one about whom he had already read in Portuguese chronicles\nwhen he was in Persia, and made special because she was both a female\nsovereign, \u2018something extraordinary in other countries\u2019, and gentile in\nreligion (see plate 11). Her main exploits consisted of having divorced her\nhusband and neighbour, the king of Banguel, and then resisted him and\nhis allies the Portuguese with a decisive victory in 1618, with the help of\nVenkatapa Nayaka (although the price she had to pay was increasing\nsubmission to her new protector). Della Valle went especially to a remote\nvillage where the queen was staying and accosted her in the street,\nimmediately establishing his prerogative as traveller-observer:\nwe saw from afar the queen of Olala coming towards us, on foot, alone\nwithout any other woman, only accompanied by four or six foot\nsoldiers before her, all naked after their manner except a cloth over\n24 In this trip he also reported stories about the \u2018base\u2019 behaviour of the queen of Gersoppa,\nwho accepted a low-caste man as her champion, and the \u2018dignified\u2019 example of\nVenkatapa\u2019s wife, who refused to have intercourse with him after he had slept with a\nMoorish woman.\n25 For della Valle\u2019s brief observations about matrilineal succession and the nayar women\nsee, India, pp. 274 and 285\u20136.\n363\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n364 TRAVEL AND ETHNOLOGY IN THE RENAISSANCE\nPlate 11 Pietro della Valle meets the queen of Olala, as depicted (imaginatively) in the\nGerman edition of his letters, Reiss-Beschreibung in unterschiedliche theile der welt (Geneva,\n1674).

Each had a sword in his hand, or at most a sword and buckler.\nThere were also as many behind her of the same sort, one of them\ncarrying a rather ordinary umbrella made of palm-leaves over her. She\nwas as black as a natural Ethiopian [African], fat and broad-waisted,\nbut not heavy, for she walked rather nimbly. Her age, it seemed to me,\nwas about forty, although the Portuguese had described her to me as\nbeing much older. She was clothed, or rather covered from the waist\ndown, with a plain piece of coarse white cotton, and her feet were bare\nas is usual among gentile Indian women, whichever their social\ncondition . . . Above the waist the queen was naked, but with a similar\ncloth tied round her head and falling over her breasts and shoulders.\nIn brief, her aspect and habit were, to tell the truth, more those of a\nkitchen wench or laundress than a delicate and noble queen.26\nDella Valle was not, however, attempting to deride the idea of feminine\nmajesty. The queen, Abag-Dev\u0131`, showed her royal quality \u2018in her speech\nrather than her presence\u2019, with her graceful voice and judicious words.\nEven though her corpulence (della Valle noted) was a bit too obvious\nbelow her waist, as a result of the Indian custom of wearing the cotton\ngarb quite tight, she must have been beautiful when she was young.\nDella Valle \u2013 this is what matters \u2013 considered a conversation with her\nno less curious and interesting than one with Shah Abbas. He was quick\nto distance himself from the discredited image of the Portuguese by\nstating his Roman identity, before explaining that, after travelling the\nworld for ten years he had been moved by the fame of the queen\u2019s\nqualities to come and offer his service to her. It is difficult to believe that\nthe queen was much impressed by this pompous introduction (on a later\noccasion she refused to receive della Valle again), and there was perhaps\nsome sarcasm in her asking what the traveller wished to see in those\nwoods of hers if, as he claimed, he had already seen the courts of the\nGreat Turk, the Persian, the Mughal, and her immediate overlord\nVenkatapa Nayaka.\nIn fact, the queen (who was busy supervising some irrigation system)\nhad been forewarned of the visit of the extravagant gentleman. She asked\nhim about his health whilst travelling in so many countries, and whether\nhe had left home for some love or similar tragic cause. She had actually\nhit upon the original cause of della Valle\u2019s pilgrimage, his desire to\nrecover from a woman\u2019s disfavour, and yet (as he writes) \u2018I concealed my\nfirst misfortunes and told the queen that I had not left my country for\nany such reason, but only out of a desire to see divers countries and\n26 Ibid., p. 227.\n365\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n366 TRAVEL AND ETHNOLOGY IN THE RENAISSANCE\ncustoms, and to learn many things which are learnt by travelling the\nworld.\u201927 The significance of della Valle\u2019s lie was not any sense of\nsuperiority, but rather the need to support the Ulysses-like persona\nwhich he had acquired throughout his travels. This persona required that\nothers identified him for what he had become in order to establish an\naristocracy of polite curiosity across cultural barriers. However humble\nthe Indian gentiles, however mistaken their worship, a simple detail\ncould sustain the universality of both female and royal dignities. He thus\nconsidered that he honoured the wench-looking queen by keeping his\nhead uncovered whilst talking to her.\nPerhaps the encounter which best exemplifies della Valle\u2019s quest for a\npositive and universal human quality behind cultural and religious\ndifferences is the dialogue with the sati Giaccama`, with whom he\nconversed during his stay at Ikkeri. When he first saw her performing a\nritual procession of despair, he immediately drew a distinction between\nthe cruel and barbarous custom of the country, and the generosity and\nvirtue of its victim. He then conceived the idea of \u2018honouring her funeral\u2019\nwith his compassionate affection.28 Four days later della Valle sought\nthe woman at home, and found her surrounded by drummers (her\nhusband himself used to be a drummer) \u2018in very good humour, talking\nand laughing in conversation as a bride would have done in our\ncountries\u2019.29 They then had a long conversation concerning his curiosity\nand her sacrifice. It became apparent that two older, less generous wives\ndid not want to die and preferred to look after their children, but that\nGiaccama` (then scarcely thirty years old) was willing to leave her\nchildren in the care of others in order to die. She insisted that she was\nacting unconstrained and of her own free will, for the sake of the glory\nof herself and her family (although her relatives also explained that this\nprinciple was not always observed among the wealthy). Finally, and this\nwas Giaccama`\u2019s gift to the traveller, and a justification of his visit, \u2018she\nregarded herself very fortunate that I had gone to see her, and very\nhonoured by my visit and presence, as well as by the fame I would carry\nof her to my country\u2019. Della Valle, seeing that it was impossible to\ndissuade her, instead promised \u2018that in the world her name would remain\nimmortal\u2019.30\nDella Valle\u2019s three sonnets to Giaccama`, which have survived in a\nmanuscript now at the Vatican Library, do not constitute a literary\nmasterpiece, but they convey what is perhaps most novel in this most\n27 Ibid., p. 229: \u2018solo per desiderio di veder terre e costumi diversi, e per apprender molte\ncose che peregrinando\u2019l mondo si apprendono\u2019.\n28 Ibid., p. 194. 29 Ibid., p. 201. 30 Ibid., p. 203.\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\nThe independent traveller in the seventeenth century\nmoving passage of the pilgrim\u2019s Viaggi: della Valle celebrated human\nvirtue within a non-Christian system of beliefs and behaviour with more\nemphasis than he condemned the cruel customs of a gentile nation. The\nthree sonnets explore three aspects of the event: the deserving virtue of\nthe widow, the contrast between her faithfulness and the falsity of her\nreligion, and della Valle\u2019s own parallel sadness for the loss of his wife,\nalthough met, properly, with Christian and Stoic resignation.31 Since\ndella Valle\u2019s original pilgrimage was in itself a denial of the temptation of\nsuicide caused by a woman\u2019s rejection of his love, Giaccama`\u2019s choice re-\nenacted his own dilemma, creating a sympathy of feeling made even\nmore dramatic by the contrast of religious doctrines. This of course\nentailed a lamentation for the barbarity of the gentile custom, but only to\nmake female virtue the more outstanding. In a passage of his original\ndiary (which the ecclesiastical censors later suppressed) the traveller even\nadded that \u2018this made me laugh of our women, who take it as a great\nthing to go and enclose themselves forever in a monastery, which is so\nmuch less of a sacrifice than dying\u2019.32 However unfair the comment \u2013 it\nwas in fact more a criticism of religious hypocrisy than an endorsement\nof female oppression \u2013 it did imply a self-reflective gaze. As is apparent\nfrom della Valle\u2019s previous discussion of sati, based on hearsay, in the\nletter written from Surat nine months earlier, the traveller\u2019s curiosity for\nthis custom was in fact more concerned with the psychology of the\nfreedom and will of the widow than with any religious or sociological\nexplanation. Della Valle wondered whether the will of the widow was\nreally free or conditioned by social pressure, much as the will of women\nwho married in Europe was often sadly conditioned by their relatives\n31 I have transcribed these sonnets, hitherto unpublished, in an appendix. Kate Teltscher,\nwho has recently emphasized how della Valle\u2019s literary recreation of the sati as a tragic\nfigure exemplifies the ambivalent attitude of European travellers towards Indian women,\nis thus incorrect in assuming the sonnet\u2019s non-existence: K. Teltscher, India inscribed.\nEuropean and British writing on India 1600\u20131800 (New Delhi, 1997), pp. 56\u20139. Strangely,\nTeltscher concludes her discussion of the literary treatment of sati in the travel literature\nof this period with a return to the very Saidian position which much of her valuable\nanalysis of diversity and ambivalence seemed previously to undermine: \u2018the Indian\nwoman becomes the focus of male European desires and fears: a body to be veiled,\nrevealed or consumed in flames. An ambivalent compound of chastity, sexual appetite,\nand the death wish, she is a fantasy woman in an imaginary land\u2019 (ibid., p. 68). In most\ncases, and certainly in the case of della Valle, the projection of the fears and desires of the\nEuropean male traveller is compatible with an empiricism which equals or even surpasses\nthe recording of ordinary observation (male or female) in Europe.\n32 BAV, Ottob. 3,382, f. 217r: \u2018me licentiai da lei, assai piu` mesto[?] della sua morte ch\u2019ella\nstesso, maledicendo il costume dell\u2019India, che con le donne e` tanto spietato, e burlandomi\ndelle donne nostre, che hanno per grande actione l\u2019andarsi a rinchiado per sempre in un\nmonasterio, che del morire e tanto manco\u2019.\n367\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n368 TRAVEL AND ETHNOLOGY IN THE RENAISSANCE\nwhen they chose a husband, so that \u2018though apparently not forced\u2019, in\neffect they were \u2018compelled into the decision by the pressure of circum-\nstances\u2019.33 Della Valle sought spiritual equality in a world of cultural\ndifferences, rather than an explanation of reasons for cultural differences\nwhich might serve to either justify the European Christians as superior,\nor to question their superiority. This (a mark of liberal Catholicism) in\nfact set him apart from the sceptical analysis of sati as mainly evidence of\nreligious superstition and clerical abuse which characterized a number of\nseventeenth-century independent travellers, like the French doctor and\ndisciple of Gassendi, Franc\u00b8ois Bernier (see plate 12).34\nEncounters with women allowed della Valle to elaborate the powerful\nwestern idea of love, Platonic and chivalric, as basis for a trans-cultural\nsynthesis. Marrying an oriental Christian opened the door to the project\nof a restored unity between East and West under Catholic patronage;\nfeeling compassion for an Indian sati allowed the traveller to rescue\nvirtue from the trappings of devilish idolatry. This was a romantic as well\nas an aristocratic solution to the problem of cultural diversity, one\ninspired by Renaissance Platonism, which made it possible to associate\nthe hypothesis of a primitive philosophical truth behind the universal\nsystem of idolatry uncovered by antiquarian research with the direct\nevidence of virtuous behaviour among gentiles. But this solution stood\namong others in seventeenth-century Europe, in the same way that della\nValle stood as one among many travellers. The most far-reaching\nseventeenth century response to the problem of cultural diversity in\ngeneral, and the virtue of the gentiles in particular, was sceptical in\nthe tradition of Montaigne and the libertins, in opposition to a\nconfessional Christian position, whether Protestant or Catholic.35 It is\ntherefore of particular importance briefly to analyse the way della Valle\ndealt with gentile religion from his apparently never questioned Catholic\nidentity.\n33 Della Valle, India, p. 65.\n34 For Bernier\u2019s account of sati see F. Bernier, Voyage dans les etats du Grand Mogol, ed.\nF. B. Hattacharya (Fayard, 1981), pp. 232\u201340. Telstcher, India, p. 67, notes that Bernier,\nunlike della Valle, succeeded in dissuading a sati from her sacrifice by invoking her\nchildren\u2019s destitution (in fact he threatened her with making sure that the Muslim Agah,\nwho was his, as well as her former husband\u2019s, employer, would not provide a pension for\nher orphans if she burnt herself ). This intervention, Teltscher concludes, only enhances\nthe traveller\u2019s sense of western superiority: \u2018Bernier steals the widow\u2019s glory to become\nthe hero himself \u2019.\n35 For this topic, E.

This intellectual optimism\nwas in reality a gamble rather than a consistent tradition, and responded\nto the climate in Rome during the first decades of the seventeenth\ncentury under popes Paul V, Gregory XV and Urban VIII. This climate\nwas conditioned by the need to meet the secular thinking of the late\nRenaissance (scientific, political and historical) on its own grounds, and\nsupported by the comprehensive edifice built by Counter-Reformation\nwriters in the previous decades.

While the ancient local religion of the Gauris (Parsis) was difficult\nto research, his conversations with Gujarati merchants in Isfahan\nallowed him to write a long dissertation about Indian idolatry, which\ncould supersede modern authorities like Botero in the light of his new\nphilological enquiries.37 This initial research allowed him to obtain some\nbasic notions about caste divisions and about popular mythologies, in\nparticular the Indian epic of the Ramayana. Above all, it allowed him to\nformulate a preliminary hypothesis about the meaning of idolatry, which\nhe understood as the divinization of human kings and heroes \u2018as it also\nhappened in our countries with Jupiter, Mars and others\u2019.38 Della Valle\nnever ceased to revise his views in the light of new discoveries. Thus a few\nyears later, still in Combru` on the Persian coast, he exploited new\nopportunities to extend his enquiries, observing a religious festival,\nlearning from an ascetic brahmin about the existence of the Sanskrit\nlanguage, and asking about the meaning of the lingam (which quite\nsurprisingly, although repeatedly described and even drawn in his\njournal, he never identified as a phallic representation).39 By the time\ndella Valle left Persia he had even started a collection of Sanskrit and\nother Indian manuscripts which he could not then read, but which he\nplanned to have translated in Europe as the occasion arose. (In Ikkeri he\nalso requested and obtained a small book in Kannada, the local\nlanguage, from the ambassador of Venkatapa.)\nIt is quite clear that his method was antiquarian and philological,\n36 The complexity of the subject makes it difficult to refer to an acceptable synthesis of the\nintellectual life in Italy in the crucial period between 1580 and 1640, and in particular the\nrole of history and science, despite the existence of a great deal of excellent monographic\nmaterial on outstanding figures like Sarpi and Galileo. Certainly della Valle participated,\nthrough personal connections and dilettante interest, in the Italian system of learning,\npatronage and debate, which between 1600 and 1620 had in Rome perhaps its main\ncentre. For example, after his ceremony of departure celebrated in Naples in 1614, della\nValle was accompanied by his friend Mario Schipano, a humanist doctor, and Marcello\nGiustiniani and his wife Caterina Boccalini, daughter of the recently deceased Traiano\nBoccalini. Della Valle took Boccalini\u2019s Ragguagli di Parnaso (1612) on his travels, along\nwith a small library on Turkey and the Near East.\n37 Della Valle, Lettere dalla Persia, ed. by Gaeta and Lockhart, pp. 68\u201377 (letter from\nIsfahan, December 1617).\n38 Ibid., p. 69.\n39 Della Valle, Persia, vol.

He would also carefully observe popular festivals. However,\nthe frame of reference was always comparison with ancient idolatry as\ndescribed in classical texts, and he relied especially on writers of history\nand geography like Diodorus Siculus or Strabo. It is probably from these\nreadings that he developed his view that specific, rather than structural,\nsimilarities between different kinds of idolatry had to be explained by\nassuming an Egyptian genealogical primacy, \u2018since the Egyptians, who\nwere descended from Cham, son of Noah, were extremely ancient\npeoples\u2019, and \u2018it is known that there always was navigation and\ncommerce between Egypt and India by the Southern sea\u2019.40 Della Valle\nwas not alone in formulating this diffusionist hypothesis concerning the\nancient history of idolatry in these dates, but it would be rash to conclude\nthat he simply borrowed it from his contemporaries like Lorenzo\nPignoria: rather, we seem to be finding here a typical instance of the\nparallel development of a theory by two contemporaries who are looking\nat new evidence from similar assumptions. The antiquarian culture of the\nearly seventeenth century, based on ancient Greek sources, pursued\nthrough philological methods, and constrained by biblical authority,\nmade the idea of Egyptian origins a logical possibility.41\n40 Della Valle, India, p. 57. The diffusionist model was explicitly suggested by Diodorus\nSiculus, who identified the Greek Dionysus with the Egyptian Osiris: Della Valle, Lettere\ndalla Persia, p. 76. In Arrian and Strabo, Dionysus was also said to have travelled to\nIndia.\n41 Lorenzo Pignoria\u2019s Le vere e nove imagini de gli dei delli antichi . . . et un discorso intorno\nle deita\u00c1 dell\u2019Indie orientali et occidentali (Padua, 1615) was an illustrated and updated\nedition of Vincenzo Cartari\u2019s standard iconographical classical pantheon (Venice, 1556).\nAnnotated with antiquarian observations, Pignoria\u2019s edition included an additional\ndiscourse, \u2018Imagini degli dei Indiani\u2019, concerning the analogies and relationship between\nEgyptian, Mexican and Indian idols, observing, for instance, that the figure with an\nelephant head described by the Jesuit Lu\u0131\u00b4s Fro\u00b4is in 1560, \u2018Ganissone\u2019 (Ganesha),\nobviously followed the Egyptian tendency to combine human and animal features\n(p. XXVII). However, this treatise was published after della Valle left Europe in 1614.\nThe traveller certainly kept in close correspondence with Europeans and it is not\nimpossible that he learnt about the book\u2019s novel hypothesis in Constantinople or Persia.\nHe actually refers to Vincenzo Cartari\u2019s Imagini degle dei in a letter from Isfahan of May\n1619 (della Valle, Lettere dalla Persia, p. 345), although he may have been using an\nearlier edition. Della Valle could also have known some of the arguments discussed by\nPignoria in his previous Egyptological work, the Vestustissimae tabulae Aeneae explicatio\n(Venice, 1605). However, della Valle does not mention any of Pignoria\u2019s works \u2013 for\ninstance when he casually suggests for the first time the similarity between the Indian\nworship of the cow as sacred and the Egyptian cult of Apis, in his early letter from\nIsfahan of December 1617 (della Valle, Lettere dalla Persia, p. 73). His analysis is\ngeneraly fuller than Pignoria\u2019s. Above all, what is crucial is that ancient Egypt was the\nlogical starting point for any antiquarian analysis of idolatry, because ancient Greek\n371\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n372 TRAVEL AND ETHNOLOGY IN THE RENAISSANCE\nInterestingly, della Valle\u2019s theory was challenged by a brahmin from\nGujarat, who claimed that some of his books had been written by the\nGreek philosopher Pythagoras, \u2018something which agrees with what\nPhilostratus says that Iarcha [the brahmin] told Apollonius [the Greek\ntraveller], namely, that concerning the soul the Indians believed that\nwhich Pythagoras had taught them, and which they then had taught the\nEgyptians\u2019.42 In effect, for reasons of his own, Philostratus had comple-\ntely reversed the traditional order within the diffusionist model.43 Della\nValle, however, was able to maintain his original theory by appealing to\nthe authority of another Greek author, Diogenes Laertius, whose\nbiography of Pythagoras did not include any journey to India. When,\ntherefore, the brahmin went on to insist that Brahma was himself\nPythagoras, della Valle was ready to dismiss the whole idea:\nThis would be interesting news indeed, and perhaps unheard in\nEurope, that Pythagoras is worshipped stupidly as God in India; but\nwithout wanting to offend Beca` Azarg [the brahmin], I do not believe\nit. Either he did not say this and I misunderstood him for lack of a\nbetter interpreter, or if he said that, he was here wrong, because he\nheard some other European talk about Pythagoras as the author of the\nfoolish opinion [stolta opinione] of the transmigration of the souls.44\nwriters pointed to Egypt as the ultimate source of Greek culture. In Italy, as early as the\nend of the fifteenth century, there had been a great deal of interest in circles of Platonist\nhumanists and artists in discovering mystical or Hermetic interpretations of Egyptian\nreligion, positing a \u2018prisca theologia\u2019 whose core was both retrievable (through the\nHermetic\u2013Pythagorean corpus) and partially valid (since it had served as basis for\nMosaic law). Although antiquarians like the Calvinist Isaac Casaubon demolished the\nHermetic core of the Egyptian paradigm by proving the late Greek origin of the corpus\n(as part of his 1614 attack on Baronius\u2019s Catholic history of the early Church), thirty and\nforty years later Athanasius Kircher still maintained his laborious Hermetic Egyptolo-\ngical research with the help of della Valle\u2019s Coptic manuscripts and a great deal of\nabsurd etymologies. On this topic in general see E. Iversen, The myth of Egypt and its\nhieroglyphs in European tradition (Copenhagen, 1961).\n42 Della Valle, India, p. 58.\n43 Della Valle read Philostratus\u2019 Life of Apollonius without realizing that it was essentially a\nfictional text. Although it reversed the diffusionist tendency by giving primacy to India,\nPhilostratus\u2019 story supported the idea of an ancient common core of rational pagan\nwisdom behind the multiplicity of idolatrous cults.\n44 Della Valle, India, p. 58. The idea that a brahmin\u2019s idea of the origins of Hinduism could\nhave been prompted by interaction with a western traveller is not absurd, however\nstrange it may seem if we simply assume that brahmins were the authoritative\nrepositories of their own tradition and identity. The English chaplain at Surat, Henry\nLord, in his polemic against the brahmins, and in order to weaken their high moral\nground in favour of the Christian revelation, insisted that their abstinence from flesh and\nwine was borrowed from Pythagoras. His important Display of two forraigne sects in the\nEast Indies (i.e. Banians and Parsis), the first printed account of Hinduism to appear in\nEurope, was published in London in 1630, but Lord was in Gujarat in the latter half of\nthe 1620s, closely following della Valle\u2019s visit. We may be wise to conclude that traditions\nare often reactive to articulate foreign observers.\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\nThe independent traveller in the seventeenth century\nIn effect, and this was conclusive, both Egyptian and brahminical\ndoctrines appeared, from Greek references, to be more ancient than\nPythagoras.\nThis passage shows quite clearly both the depth and flexibility of della\nValle\u2019s antiquarian opinions, and his use of a classical framework in\norder to criticize and evaluate native authorities. His position was\nessentially open: he could contemplate both the possibility of a diversity\nof idols emerging from separate human models, or the transformation of\nthe same hero-king according to diffusion and linguistic diversity. He was\nalso able to distinguish the \u2018atheistic\u2019 philosophy of the Japanese Bud-\ndhists (which he learnt from a Christian Japanese who was on his way to\nRome) from the basically deistic idolatry of India. However, on the other\nhand, della Valle\u2019s use of the chronological tables of the Jesuit theologian\nRoberto Bellarmino (and not, significantly, the more far-reaching work\nof Joseph Scaliger) allowed him to pursue this reconstruction of ancient\nidolatry without departing from the biblical framework which he was\nbound to accept.45 Della Valle belonged to a generation which, having\nreceived the new authorities of the Italian Counter-Reformation like the\nsame Bellarmino, Cesare Baronius or Antonio Possevino, could trust\nhistory to clarify, rather than challenge, Catholic orthodoxy.46 Whilst\ndella Valle was not a priori trying to question Indian authorities (rather\nthe contrary), all his curiosity was never used to question the fundamental\nassumption that idolatry was both devilish and irrational. In this sense,\nthere is a delicate balance between the relativism of his analysis of\ncustoms and his scrupulous observance of religious orthodoxy, one which\nmirrors the tension between his sympathy for the sati\u2019s personal virtue\n45 Della Valle\u2019s mention of Bellarmino\u2019s work must refer to his Brevi chronologia ab orbe\ncondito usque ad annum 1612 which accompanied his De scriptoribus ecclesiasticis liber\nunus (1612). The Calvinist Scaliger\u2019s Opus novus de emendatione temporum had been\npublished in 1583, and immediately transformed the Renaissance science of chronology\n(inevitably based on the Bible) into a systematic antiquarian discipline, through a better\nunderstanding of classical and oriental sources, and with the crucial aid of mathematical\nastronomy. If not earlier, della Valle would have become acquainted with the figure of\nScaliger \u2013 and of his interest in Samaritan traditions \u2013 during his antiquarian\ncorrespondence with Peiresc in the late 1620s, after his return to Rome (see P. Miller, \u2018A\nphilologist, a traveller and an antiquary rediscover the Samaritans in seventeenth-\ncentury Paris, Rome and Aix\u2019, in H. Zedelmaier and M. Mulsow (eds.), Gelehrsamkeit\nals Praxis: Arbeitsweisen, Funktionen, Grenzbereiche (forthcoming)). Della Valle, like\nPeiresc, believed that in matters of civility and scholarship Europeans should cooperate\nwith each other, even if they did not share religious convictions. Through civil\nconversation, in fact, Catholics could attract intelligent Protestants to their faith.\n46 Bellarmino insisted in his own chronological work that anachronism was often a sign of\nheresy. The key historical and antiquarian works of the Counter-Reformation were\npublished in Italy in the 1580s and 90s, including Baronius\u2019 Annales ecclesiastiae\n(1588\u2013 ) and Possevino\u2019s critical catalogue, the Apparatus ad omnium gentium\nhistoriarum (1597).\n373\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n374 TRAVEL AND ETHNOLOGY IN THE RENAISSANCE\nand his criticism of the cruel customs which she upheld. The contemp-\ntuous words which disqualified the worship of any gods other than the\ntrue God, or the doctrine of transmigration of the souls, were only a\nritual reminder that the issue here was history, not religion.\nIn a number of passages della Valle makes this fundamental under-\nstanding of the devilish contents of idolatry clear. Certainly, behind the\nextravagant cults which evolved due to the vanity of kings and heroes\nthere existed a theistic belief, but the use of oracles was not simply a\nquestion of human vanity and ignorance, revealing instead a serious\nintercourse with the devil. Thus della Valle did not question the veracity\nof his Gujarati informer Natu` when he asserted that the oracles did\nindeed predict the future, because, as was the case with many of his own\nEuropean witch-hunting contemporaries, a humanist education did not\nexclude a firm belief in the reality of the devil. It was logically simple to\ntransform Christian exclusiveness into charitable contempt: \u2018The baniani\nknow the devil to be a very evil thing, but the poor wretches do not\nimagine the extent to which they are under his influence.\u201947 This belief\nemerged even more forcefully when he was given a chance to study\nclosely the naked yogis of Cambay, and in this case (perhaps because\nthey refused to befriend him) without any charitable undertones: their\nunworldliness was studied arrogance, their chastity probably hypocri-\ntical, \u2018since it is known that in secret many of them do vile acts when they\nhave an opportunity\u2019, and above all their books and exercises, whether\nspiritual or erudite, \u2018consist in nothing but the arts of divination, the\nsecrets of herbs and other things of nature, and magic and spells\u2019. The\nconclusion was clear: \u2018by way of such exercises, prayers, fastings and\nsuch similar superstitions, they arrive (it seems to them) at revelations,\nwhich in effect are nothing other than commerce with the devil\u2019.48\nThe intense South Indian journey, and in particular the opportunity to\nstudy closely Shaiva worship in Kanara, with its explicitly sexual themes,\nonly offered further arguments to sustain this interpretation: \u2018indeed, the\ngreatest part of their worship of their gods consists in nothing but music,\nsongs and dances, not only pleasant but in effect lascivious, and in\nserving their idols as if they were living persons\u2019. This idolatrous\nsensualism stood directly in contrast with an intellectual religion based\non learning, which is the aspect that della Valle valued most.\nI once asked an old priest who was held more knowing than others,\ngrey and clad all in white, carrying a staff like a shepherd\u2019s crook in his\n47 Della Valle, Lettere dalla Persia, p. 75.\n48 Della Valle, India, pp. 80\u20131.

He told me that all books were made\nonly that men might with them known God; but if God were known,\nwhat was the purpose of books? as if he knew God very well. I replied\nthat all thought they knew God, but few knew him properly, and\ntherefore he should beware that himself was not one of those.49\nThis remarkable passage shows not only della Valle\u2019s desire for\nreligious dialogue and the Indian\u2019s capacity to reply with intelligence, but\nalso the fact that the independent traveller of the seventeenth century, by\nseeking to analyse diversity from an intellectual viewpoint, was actually\nundermining European popular religion. Would della Valle have ex-\npected Italian peasants and lazzaroni to read books in order to learn true\nreligion? Or was religious truth only for the few? In fact, his position was\ncontradictory, because the Counter-Reformation elites not only expected\nCatholic ritual to sustain popular belief, they in fact often participated\nwith enthusiasm. Della Valle\u2019s happiness at the news of the canonization\nof Philip Neri and Teresa of Avila, Ignatius of Loyola and Francis\nXavier, was unrestrained, as his diary of the events of 1623 attests, and\nhe willingly joined the festivities in Goa in honour of Saint Teresa (a\nfavourite of his), participating in the baroque masquerade with his\nArabian dress, and even creating a multi-lingual emblem in honour of\nher twelve virtues.50 Della Valle\u2019s religious confidence, it may even be\nargued, was the foundation of his remarkably relaxed dialogue with the\nChristian heretic, with the Muslim and with the gentile.\nUltimately, this dialogue with non-Christians rested upon the same\ndualistic level of belief in the devil which we encountered in earlier\ntravellers like Marco Polo and Ludovico de Varthema. The traveller was\nsimply a committed agent and witness of a struggle between God and his\nrival. When, on occasion, della Valle spat upon a statue in a private\nchapel of the queen of Olala, not a common idol from the established\nbrahminic pantheon, but rather a \u2018devil\u2019 (as his interpreter explained)\nwhich the people feared for its power, his action was spontaneous and\ncertainly not just there for the benefit of the European readers.51 In fact,\n49 Ibid., p. 204.\n50 Ibid., p. 127. Della Valle later re-used the idea of this emblem (with epitaphs in twelve\nlanguages describing twelve virtues) for the sepulchre which he commissioned for the\nsolemn funeral of Sitti Maani in Rome. She was buried in the family chapel of Saint Paul\nof Aracoeli.\n51 Ibid., pp. 253\u20134. However, the statue (della Valle noted) did not look like the devil in\nEuropean representations: rather he was a handsome young man with four hands and\nwearing a diadem, with a knife in his hand and riding upon another man. It was not\ntherefore the image itself which prompted della Valle to a ritual act of defiance, but\n375\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n376 TRAVEL AND ETHNOLOGY IN THE RENAISSANCE\ndella Valle was for all his curiosity and politeness profoundly imbued\nwith a crusading ideology, which had taken him to participate in anti-\ncorsair skirmishes in North Africa in 1611, and which through his travels\nfound expression in his hatred for the Ottoman Turks, seen as relentless\noppressors of Christians (in sharp contrast with the more cynical Shah\nAbbas of Persia, whom della Valle believed could be turned into an ally,\nso much so that soon after reaching Persia he offered to fight in his army\nagainst the Turks).52 Della Valle liked to think of himself as a\ngentleman-warrior no less than poet, musician and lover, following the\nRenaissance model of a courtier who was equally able to use the sword\nand the pen.\nHowever, despite all these marks of traditionalism, what really distin-\nguished the new traveller\u2019s persona was his intellectualism: not only his\ndesire to discuss customs and beliefs with the local people, and especially\nthe better educated amongst them, but above all his decision, unprece-\ndented from a lay perspective, to explore gentile religion from a historical\nand antiquarian perspective. This went beyond the mere elevation of the\nRenaissance courtier into a genuinely cosmopolitan setting. His curiosity\nwas methodical, even though his analysis evolved spontaneously and\nappears rather dispersed throughout his letters. This curiosity was also\nintellectually courageous. It is thus significant that he planned to have\ntranslated into Italian \u2018for the sake of the curious\u2019 a book of Indian\ndivination, obtained from those very yogis whose practice he had just\ndefined as outright commerce with the devil.53 This was more far-\nreaching than just writing a Turkish grammar or collecting a couple of\nmummies. The wide range of della Valle\u2019s orientalist research was\nsustained by a supreme confidence, reminiscent of Ramon Llull\u2019s more\nprimitive version of Christian rationalism, that linguistic and antiquarian\nexpertise could only help sustain the traditional system of mission and\ncrusade.\nrather the fearful belief of the local inhabitants (as he interpreted it). Concerning the\norigins and importance of these local warrior gods, worshipped (like the queen of\nOlala\u2019s) in small shrines around trees, see Bayly, Saints, goddesses and kings, pp. 28\u201332.\n52 Della Valle explains this decision to stay in Persia to fight the Turks in detail in his letter\nof December 1617 (della Valle, Lettere dalla Persia, pp. 91\u20136). At his most aggressive he\nwrote that \u2018even at night, while sleeping, I dream about the greatest harm that I may\ncause to the Turks, our common enemies\u2019. His pet crusading project consisted of forging\nan anti-Ottoman alliance between Persia and the Cossacks from the kingdom of Poland.\nBut his plan had also a constructive aspect: to create a \u2018New Rome\u2019 in Persia, a self-\ngoverning city of oriental and Latin Christians (specifically including his relatives from\nBaghdad) under Shah Abbas and Roman Catholic sponsorship. Both plans \u2013 crusade\nand mission \u2013 failed.\n53 Della Valle, India, p. 82: \u2018procurero` anco che possa vedersi un giorno da\u2019curiosi in nostra\nlingua\u2019.

In this sense\ndella Valle shared the Thomist distinction developed by the Jesuits\nbetween valid civil customs which were relative to place and time, and a\nuniversal religious truth which could only be Christian. He showed\nawareness of the contemporary debate within the Jesuit order caused by\nNobili\u2019s experiments, but although he discussed some of the criticisms\nand counter-arguments in a letter from Surat, he prudently declined to\nsuggest a conclusion, or to add anything in his letters from Goa, where\nthe issue was burning in the expectation of a papal decision.54 But della\nValle was quite decisive in his use of the distinction when discussing\nHindu customs from personal observation. The use of cow dung to\nvarnish the pavements of houses, for instance, \u2018I took for a superstitious\nrite of religion, but since I better understand that it is used only for\nelegance and ornament [per pulitezza e per ornamento]\u2019.55 In fact, not\nonly did the Portuguese use the custom in Goa, but della Valle would\nalso try it in Italy, since it was said that these pavements were good\nagainst the plague. This was a practical solution to the lack of better\npavements, unlike the caste prohibitions of the gentile elite, which\nused the same cow dung to purify a room before eating there \u2018out of\nsuperstition\u2019.\nThese distinctions marked both the quality and the limitation of della\nValle\u2019s relativism. The essential mark of his cultural analysis was the\nconfidence in the rational value of his own religion. He could distance\nhimself from the beliefs of the prince of Olala by pointing out that \u2018the\npurity of my religion does not depend on eating things or touching\nothers, but on doing good or bad works\u2019 \u2013 but he never applied a\nsceptical analysis of religion that might be turned against Catholic\ndoctrine.56 In this sense della Valle stands very far from the scepticism of\nlater travellers like Franc\u00b8ois Bernier, whose pitiless assault on Hinduism\nin his Lettre a Monsieur Chapelain of 1667, because it was a secular\nanalysis, was dangerously capable of simply being turned back against\nChristianity.57\n54 Della Valle discusses in particular the debate about the status of the brahminical thread\nin his letter from Surat: ibid., pp. 67\u20139. Although in Persia della Valle was close to the\nPortuguese Augustinians, rivals of the Jesuits, in Goa he befriended the latter.\n55 Ibid., p. 166.\n56 Ibid., p. 239. This prince was the queen\u2019s adolescent son, who entertained della Valle\nwith a meal and asked him many questions about Europe.\n57 For Bernier\u2019s discussion of Hinduism see Bernier, Voyage, pp. 227\u201365.

Murr, \u2018La politique \u2018au Mogol\u2019 selon Bernier:\n377\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n378 TRAVEL AND ETHNOLOGY IN THE RENAISSANCE\nThe profoundly different nature of this French traveller\u2019s attitude\nmerits some illustration. The scepticism of Bernier\u2019s analysis of Hinduism\nresided in the irony with which his anti-religious and anti-clerical diatribe\nwas reserved for gentile beliefs and the role of the brahmins, but not for\nChristians. The fact that his discussion of religion as superstition\nexcluded the agency of the devil and focused instead on social indoctrina-\ntion implied a secularizing reversal of the missionary condemnation of\nthe idolaters as manipulators of a natural religious instinct. This, of\ncourse, opened the way for more disturbing possibilities of self-reflection,\nmade explicit by the refusal to accept any explanations of extraordinary\nevents other than natural ones. In this sense the first paragraph of the\nletter on Hinduism gives an important key to an understanding of what\nfollows, by stressing the fundamental comparability of European and\nnon-European belief systems: Bernier compares the childish terror of the\ncommon people of France in reaction to an eclipse in 1654 to the\nsuperstitious beliefs of the Indian gentiles in reaction to another eclipse\nin 1666. Both are dismissed as ridiculous in front of the scientific truth of\nnaturalistic astronomer-philosophers. Similarly, Bernier\u2019s attack on the\nIndian idea of reincarnation also involved a direct attack on western\nPlatonism, referring for instance to Gassendi\u2019s atomist criticism of the\nalchemical and animist science of Robert Fludd.58\nAs with Nobili, the paradox of della Valle\u2019s position lies in the way he\ncontributed to the emergence of this sceptical outlook he never endorsed.\nIf he is far from Bernier, he stands even further from the irreverent\nattitude towards biblical authority developed by Pierre Bayle in his\nDictionnaire historique et critique (1696), both rejecting the validity of\nallegorical readings, and deploring the moral coherence of literal ones.\nThis attitude (whose tenor was revolutionary whatever we choose to\nbelieve about Bayle\u2019s private beliefs) was to a large extent sustained by\nthe antiquarian scholarship and travel literature of the seventeenth\ncentury, to which della Valle\u2019s oriental manuscripts and letters had\ncontributed so much.59\nappareil conceptuel, rhe\u00b4torique strate\u00b4gique, philosophie morale\u2019, in J.

In order fully to criticize European civil\nand religious assumptions the figure of an outsider \u2013 an oriental traveller,\nor a savage from Canada \u2013 provided a rhetorical voice which made\nrelativism obvious and criticism ambiguous (this ambiguity was of course\nnecessary under Louis XIV\u2019s censorship: the real voice of Mahmut was\nin reality Cartesian rather than strictly Muslim). But this figure needed a\nconvincing form and gaze \u2013 and both the form and the gaze of this\nintelligent traveller were in the first place the creation of Europeans like\ndella Valle.\nIt is the force and depth with which della Valle transformed empirical\nobservation into antiquarian research and speculation which also sets\nhim apart from late sixteenth-century travellers in southern India,\nforeign witnesses of the decline of Portuguese Goa like the Dutch Jan\nHuyghen van Linschoten,61 the Florentine Francesco Carletti,62 the\nof this correspondence in the later seventeenth century see also the Antiquitates ecclesiae\norientalis (London 1682) edited by the English biblical scholar Richard Simon. Not\ninsignificantly, Simon was the key figure behind Pierre Bayle\u2019s biblical scepticism. In his\n1683 Pense\u00b4es sur la come\u00c1te, Bayle repeatedly based thoughts on the observations of\nrecent travellers, including della Valle (in this he was no different from Montaigne,\nexcept that Montaigne relied on Le\u00b4ry, Oso\u00b4rio and Go\u00b4mara, rather than Bernier,\nTavernier or Rycaut). On the other hand, della Valle\u2019s Coptic manuscripts were used by\nAthanasius Kircher in his epoch-making Lingua Aegyptiaca restituta (Rome, 1644).

Similarly, whilst Jacques\nde Coutre \u2013 another Netherlander in Portuguese India, but one whose\nfamily remained faithful to the Spanish monarchy and to Catholicism \u2013\nwas the exceptional witness of the conditions in the interior of the\nsouthern peninsula, and in particular the fragmentation of political\nauthority in the second decade of the seventeenth century, his excursions\ninto history, and many of his judgements on politics or religion, were\noften remarkably superficial.67 For example, Coutre\u2019s version of the\nGrand Duke of Tuscany in 1606, although they were not published until 1701, and only\nin a summarized version. For a better manuscript, the basis for all critical editions, see\nF. Carletti, Ragionamento del mio viaggio intorno al mondo, ed. by G. Silvestro (Turin,\nl958).\n63 There is a recent edition of the Voyage de Franc\u00b8ois Pyrard de Laval aux Indes orientales\n(1601\u201311), ed. by Xavier de Castro, 2 vols. (Paris, 1998). The first three editions were\npublished in 1611, 1615 and 1619.\n64 Coutre\u2019s account of his life and adventures in southern India and other parts of the\nPortuguese and Spanish empires between 1592 and 1623 was never published. It was\nwritten or perhaps dictated in Portuguese by Jacques and translated into Castilian by his\nGoa-born son Estevan in 1640, shortly after Jacques\u2019 death. For further particulars see\nthe recent edition (which is also the first), Jacques de Coutre, Andanzas asia\u00b4ticas, ed. by\nE. Stols, B. Teensma and J. Werberckmoes (Madrid, 1991).\n65 Linschoten\u2019s family connections in Seville allowed him to enter the service of the new\narchbishop of Goa Vicente de Fonseca, who obviously did not expect him to eventually\nturn Protestant and decisively break the Portuguese and Italian control of primary\ninformation on the East.\n66 Linschoten, The voyage, vol. I, pp. 175\u2013222. The Portuguese emerged here, as in della\nValle\u2019s account twenty years later, or as in Francesco Carletti\u2019s \u2018ragionamento\u2019 of his\nstay in the city in 1600\u20131 during his journey around the world, as an \u2018other\u2019, with their\npredominant mestic\u00b8o population, their pompous and punctilious codes of honour, and\ntheir inflated stories of sexual jealousies, infidelities and poisonings. Although Carletti\u2019s\naccount of India \u2013 the fourth \u2018ragionamento\u2019 \u2013 is very entertaining, information about\nactual conditions in India is unreliable except for Malabar, Goa and its environs.\n67 Like many Flemish traders and skilled workers, Coutre\u2019s family saw the Iberian\nPeninsula as an area of economic opportunity. Thus their fortune was made through the\nexploitation of the declining Hispanic colonial system from inside rather than by\nchallenging it from outside (Jacques and his brother even married Indo-Portuguese\nwomen in Goa).

We\nmay only find a genuine precedent to della Valle\u2019s erudite attitudes in the\nletters of the Florentine Filippo Sassetti, also a merchant who, whilst\ntrying to recover his family\u2019s fortunes as agent of the Rovellasca\ncommercial interests in the spice monopoly, still participated in a circle\nof humanist correspondents, including the Grand Duke of Tuscany and\nthe Academia degli Alterati in Florence.71 He thus used his wide readings\nspying role, and was conventionally addressed to Philip III as a justification and promise\nof service to the crown.\n68 See Coutre, Andanzas, pp. 245\u20138. On this trip to the interior Coutre often resided with\nthe Jesuits, including Gonzalo Fernandes and Roberto de Nobili in Madurai, but he\nmakes many little mistakes. Thus he wrongly names Fernandes and Nobili \u2018Pero\u2019 and\n\u2018Andre\u00b4s\u2019, and Venkata II of Vijayanagara, \u2018Rama\u2019. He wrongly suggests that the Jesuit\nbishop of the Saint Thomas Christians was Italian (Francesc Ros was Catalan). He is\ncorrect when he declares that the mission of Vijayanagara was temporarily deserted in\n1611 for lack of results and because the Dutch were now trading with the king, although\nhe was naturally unaware that Philip III had also ordered the interruption of the mission\ndue to the scandal of Fontebona\u2019s supposedly erotic paintings (Coutre met Fontebona in\nMadurai). All this, and many other details, suggest that Coutre did not invent this and\nsubsequent expeditions, but rather that he wrote, or dictated, from memory and without\nnotes, many years after the events.\n69 Coutre\u2019s first expedition to the diamond mines of southern India (ibid., pp. 237\u201357) took\nhim from Cochin, across the Ghats inhabited by the Christians of Saint Thomas, to\nMadurai and then Vellore and Chandragiri in Vijayanagara. From there he visited\nTirupati and reached the mines in Nandial.\n70 Franc\u00b8ois Pyrard de Laval\u2019s account of Goa, Malabar and the Maldives is a special case,\nsince the successive editions of the text were edited and extensively augmented by Pierre\nBergeron, an erudite canon working with Pyrard.

He noted the decline in\npower of the gentiles and the progressive triumph of Muslim rulers,\nanalysed the caste system, identified the Indian brahmins with Pliny\u2019s\nancient Bracmenes, speculated about the natural causes for differences in\ncolour among humans (dismissing a crude climatic determinism), learnt\nabout Sanskrit language and literature, and compared the Indians\u2019\nadmirable knowledge of mathematics (which, he was ready to suggest,\nante-dated that of the Arabs) with what he understood as their confused\nuse of Aristotelian philosophical concepts.72 In fact Sassetti preceded\ndella Valle and other seventeenth-century travellers in many specific\nways, speculating about the Egyptian and ancient Mediterranean origins\nof Indian idolatry, and showing contempt for the vanity of gentile\nsuperstition on the basis of western rationalistic values.73 With remark-\nable insight and originality, he defined the unity of India through its\ncommon religious tradition (of course idolatrous) despite political, ethnic\nor even caste divisions, and interpreted the instability of southern Indian\nmonarchies as being a result of the feudal system which prevailed in\nVijayanagara and the Deccan.74\nObviously in this case the merchant fully participated in the erudite,\nhumanist culture of the aristocracy. Albeit lacking the immediacy of\ndella Valle\u2019s style as a writer, and visited by death before he could return\nto Italy to see the publication of his letters, Sassetti was nevertheless able\nto establish a relationship with the modern authority of the travel\ncollectors Ramusio and The\u00b4vet which foreshadowed della Valle\u2019s posi-\ntion with respect to his contemporaries Botero and Purchas: his lay voice\nColoquios dos simples e drogas exceptionally published in Goa in 1563, might be seen as\nanother example of erudite travel writing in the second half of the sixteenth century, but\nOrta\u2019s medical interests meant that he mainly discussed medical botany, precluding a\nwider discusssion of ethnological themes.\n72 The key letters discussing Indian religion and culture are those sent from Cochin to\nFranceso Valori (December 1583), Pier Vettori (January 1585), Lorenzo Canigiano\n(January 1585) and Ferdinand of Medici (February 1585).

It is clear that his desire to\ninterpret his findings and to make his discoveries public preceded his\ninternational contacts, but it was the intense flowering of orientalist\nprojects in Rome, Paris and Vienna in the decades following his return to\nRome which effectively ensured that his Samaritan and Coptic manu-\nscripts were published and their significance (ultimately theological)\ndiscussed by Catholic and Protestant scholars alike.75 However, the\necumenism of this antiquarian effort did not in the short term dissolve\nthe theological and political differences that separated confessional\ncamps. Della Valle did not therefore abandon his conventional perspec-\ntives on an anti-Ottoman alliance with Persia, or his pet project of a\nCatholic mission to Georgia. In the latter project he was particularly\nsuccessful, first by offering the Barberini Pope Urban VIII (who for this\nreason made him chamberlain of honour) an optimistic account of the\nprospects in Georgia based on his observations from Persia, and after-\nwards, under the umbrella of the Propaganda Fide, by providing regular\ndiplomatic advice for the rather incompetent Theatine missionaries who\nhad been sent. (The Theatines, pious, conservative and inexperienced,\nwere an odd choice for the job, but understandable as the Propaganda\u2019s\nattempt to avoid the controversial and overly influential Jesuits; della\nValle\u2019s more sensible recommendation had been to send Jesuits from\nEurope, or the discalced Carmelites already in Persia.)76\nThere is, however, evidence in della Valle\u2019s journal and letters of these\nRoman years that after a long period of cosmopolitan independence the\nRoman atmosphere proved stifling, even under the leadership of a\n75 See note 59 above.\n76 Informatione della Georgia (1626) was only published, in France, by Melchise\u00b4dech\nThe\u00b4venot in 1663.

Della Valle was aware that the Georgians\nfollowed the Greek rite, but he was naively optimistic about their willingness to follow\nthe Roman rite, because they were not \u2018people of letters\u2019. Rather, they were seen as a\nfreedom-loving martial nation, able to create quite a lot of trouble for both Persians and\nTurks.\n383\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n384 TRAVEL AND ETHNOLOGY IN THE RENAISSANCE\nliberal-minded Pope who was also surrounded by some of della Valle\u2019s\nerudite friends. One instance of this disappointment was the poor\nreception of his encomiastic portrait of Shah Abbas, published in 1628\nand dedicated in fact to the Pope\u2019s nephew, Cardinal Francesco\nBarberini. The Roman censorship refused to allow the distribution of the\nbook because the portrayal of an infidel ruler as a heroic and prudent\nking, and the justification of his policies towards Christians as no worse\nthan Christian policies towards Jews and infidels, was ideologically\ndisturbing in the context of the current debate about reason of state. The\nofficial Catholic position was that true religion was a requisite for truly\ngreat politics, and that no real parallel existed between Christians and\nnon-Christians. For della Valle, the demystification of petty South\nIndian kings did not involve a general condemnation of oriental\ndespotism: it resulted from the stark contrast presented by Shah Abbas,\nwho stood as a prudent, rather than tyrannical, king, fulfilling reason-of-\nstate ideals above religious definitions.77 Effectively, with his separation\nof true religion from political rationality, della Valle entered the world of\nmen like Galileo, who similarly sought to constrain clerical authority to\nstrictly religious matters in order to give free rein to rational enquiry.\nThey both suffered (although della Valle certainly suffered less) under\nthe superficially liberal regime of the baroque Papacy, on account of\ntheir imaginative understanding of what was possible for a lay gaze\nwithin the Counter-Reformation.\nThis is why the real challenge \u2013 the real flowering of sceptical seeds\ntowards the Enlightenment \u2013 would have to come from the Netherlands,\nEngland and France. Due to censorship, the orientalist projects in which\ndella Valle\u2019s manuscripts played such an important role \u2013 especially the\npolyglot Bible \u2013 actually developed in France rather than in Rome.\nAlthough the literature in Italian concerning oriental courts (such as\nConstantinople) remained important, the critical mass of independent\ntravellers whose accounts after 1650 contributed so much to the crystal-\nlization of notions of oriental despotism, natural religion, and the\nrelativity of human customs, was mainly French and, to a lesser extent,\n77 Della Valle wanted to publish the book in Rome but, unable to do so, tried in Venice,\npretending, however, that the initiative was the publisher Francesco Baba\u2019s. Despite the\nprohibition the work actually circulated among European erudites through personal\ngifts. I have consulted a copy of Delle conditioni di Abbas, Re di Persia (Venice, 1628) in\nthe Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana (R. I. iv. 84) which has valuable marginalia by a\ncontemporary critic, who seems to have known della Valle as well as the circumstances\nof the book\u2019s prohibition. This reader (perhaps the recipient of the book, Cardinal\nBarberini) associated oriental tyranny with the incommensurability between Christianity\nand other religions, whilst della Valle implied that moral and political systems were\nessentially comparable from a rational perspective, whatever the quality of the religion.\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\nThe independent traveller in the seventeenth century\nEnglish. Writing within a few years of each other, and often feeding into\na public debate, Bernier and Tavernier, The\u00b4venot and Chardin, Rycaut\nand Galland, had a larger impact than any isolated traveller like della\nValle could have achieved (in effect the long-term impact of the Viaggi\nwas related to their incorporation into this northern European cultural\nhorizon). In effect della Valle stood in the same position with regards to\nFranc\u00b8ois Bernier as his contemporary Nobili in relation to the author of\nthe philosophical preface to Rogerius\u2019 Open door: they were both out-\nstandingly sophisticated products of a Roman world which was suddenly\nretreating from the confident Catholic assertion of the turn of the\nseventeenth century (however tinged by compromise with reason of state,\ncultural adaptation and antiquarian perspectives), to increasing depen-\ndence on the emerging French-dominated culture of libertins and deists\nwhich would set the tone in Europe after 1650.78 One was a world that\nsanctified Ignatius of Loyola but could not take Copernicanism; the\nother was scandalized by, but also welcomed, the new philosophy of\nGassendi and Descartes.\nThus, even at his most radical, della Valle\u2019s philosophy was Platonic\nand Neostoic rather than libertin. This is evident in the humanist oration\nconcerning his travels which he delivered to the Academy of the Umoristi\non his return, which after reviewing the diversity of the world and its\nchangeability concluded that \u2018virtue alone is worth our esteem\u2019.79 This\nopposition between universal vanity and universal virtue was of course\nprevious to any experience as traveller: the world simply served to\nillustrate a philosophical truth which belonged to della Valle\u2019s education\nin the humanism of the late Renaissance. A similar judgement could be\nmade about the issues raised in the fuller description of della Valle\u2019s\nphilosophical wisdom offered by his first biographer, Bellori, in the 1662\nedition of the Viaggi:\nHe used to say, concerning human customs, that vices and virtues can\nbe found in all places, and that the good and the bad are disseminated\nall over; he had not found anything better, or worse, than mankind;\n78 For a classic assessment of the shape and significance of this cultural climate, and of its\nreliance on travel literature, see Hazard, La crise de la conscience europe\u00b4ene, still\nimportant today, although confining the phenomenon rather arbitrarily to the period\n1680\u20131715.\n79 \u2018La virtu` sola conchiudo esser degna di stima\u2019, from \u2018Oratione del sig.

This (quite different from the oration that he had drafted in Persia) remains\nunpublished. I am planning to edit it. We know from Bellori\u2019s biography that della\nValle\u2019s oration was offered as a response to a previous oration on the utility of voyages\nby Angelo Filatrello \u2013 a subject conventional in this period.\n385\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n386 TRAVEL AND ETHNOLOGY IN THE RENAISSANCE\nopinion and custom are extremely powerful; all profess to know, but\nignorance is common; misfortunes are many, and successful outcomes\nfew; those are always ready, these rarely happen to us; nature in all\nlands is a common mother: it distributes her gifts to all, and where\nsome are missing others compensate; however, only few among the\nmortals know how to use these gifts, and the majority abuse them to\ntheir own harm. Finally, he used to say that among all the things he\nhad seen, one alone he had vainly searched for and not found, through\nall his travels, for many years, in many places, in the midst of humble,\nhigh and royal fortunes. This was that he had never encountered a\nman who was entirely happy; rather the contrary, he had found many,\nwithout number, who were extremely unhappy.80\nHere again the traveller\u2019s experience could tinge his moral philosophy\nwith a certain scepticism, and even a naturalistic relativism, congenial to\nLipsius and Montaigne, without openly addressing any theological\nissues. This remained in seventeenth-century Rome the key formal\nlimitation to a self-proclaimed citizenship of the world.\nDella Valle therefore exemplifies a particular version of the integration\nof the empirical traveller and the humanist-educated philosopher and\nantiquarian. Analysed alongside other well-known seventeenth-century\nindependent travellers in the Orient like Bernier, La Boullaye, Tavernier,\nChardin, The\u00b4venot and Rycaut, creators of what was perhaps the key\ncomponent of the ethnological reading-list of the early Enlightenment,\nwhat is most distinguishable is della Valle\u2019s fashioning of a persona of\npious learned curiosity whose romance of tragic love and triumph of\nhuman wisdom were staged in a universal theatre, for posterity no less\nthan for his own times. If we can judge from the circulation of his work\nin Italian, French, Dutch, English and German in quick succession over\nless than fifteen years, his own correspondence with the international\nnetwork of antiquarians of the seventeenth century, his participation in\nthe life of learned academies like the \u2018Umoristi\u2019 of Rome, and finally, the\nexistence of no less than two biographies of his life (like Bellori\u2019s) which\nsoon prefaced the Italian edition of his letters, it is clear that della Valle\u2019s\nself-fashioning as a curious and cosmopolitan pilgrim was socially\nre-fashioned, and found a niche in the intellectual gallery of baroque\nEurope.\nDella Valle\u2019s unpremeditated style, unconventional, fresh and direct,\ndominated by the idea of making accessible the naked truth in unadorned\nlanguage, can be seen as a literary equivalent of Caravaggio\u2019s contempo-\nrary radical naturalism, equally pious but also sharing a considerable\n80 Della Valle, Turquia (1662), \u2018Vita di Pietro della Valle il pellegrino\u2019.\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\nThe independent traveller in the seventeenth century\npotential for overt sensuality and thus moral scandal.81 What della Valle\naccomplished was to institutionalize a new model of historical prose\nwhich inherited Renaissance ideals of truthfulness, participated in an\nerudite, humanistic antiquarianism, and (through the accident of Mario\nSchipano\u2019s failure to perform his commission) went beyond restrictive\nconventions of rhetorical order and propriety. Thus della Valle\u2019s legacy\npointed towards the Enlightenment in two fundamental ways: by partici-\npating in a sophisticated manner in the creation of the persona of the\ngentleman-traveller of the Grand Tour, and by proposing a philosophical\ndiscourse concerning human diversity which encompassed both civil and\nreligious themes \u2013 a discourse effectively sustained by a practice of\nnaturalistic observation and enquiry which might have been best defined\nas scientific, had della Valle\u2019s personal experience not been so whimsical.\nBut much as he was a predecessor, della Valle was also an inheritor, and\nfor this reason can serve us as epilogue for our analysis of the evolution\nof the travel literature of the Renaissance.\n81 It would of course be exaggerating, and also unnecessary, to suggest that della Valle\u2019s\nstyle was directly inspired by Caravaggio\u2019s naturalism. On the other hand, he was\ncertainly aware of the dispute about Caravaggio\u2019s style, since it dominated the academies\nof Rome during the years of della Valle\u2019s formation, before disappointment in love and\nwar drove him to assume the pilgrim\u2019s garb in 1614. Eventually Caravaggio and della\nValle would share the same biographer, Giovan Pietro Bellori. Della Valle\u2019s interest in\npainting is well attested, and when he left for Turkey, Egypt and the Holy Land he took\nalong, in his pay, a young Flemish painter called John (who had previously been working\nin Naples). John accompanied him to Persia too. Unfortunately his paintings appear to\nhave been lost. Although the editor of the Viaggi Biagio Deversin had planned a full\nfourth part with illustrations, he could only find a few schematic drawings of temples and\npalaces in India.\n387\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2009Downloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 158.143.197.39 on Wed Jan 04 15:39:21 GMT 2012.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511496608.012\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2012\n"}
