Following Garvin\u00b4s statement [16] that only learning that can be measured will be useful \nto managers, the SKIN simulation shows the outcome of different learning activities. The \nmodel embodies some theoretical ideas from the OL literature and implements many OL \nconcepts (e.g. from [4, 22, 23, 28]). Thus, the SKIN model is not only interesting for \nmanagers and other practitioners responsible for empirical learning processes within firms but \nalso for scientists testing theories from the body of research on organizational learning. \n \n2 The Model \nSKIN is a multi-agent model containing heterogeneous agents that act and interact in a \ncomplex and changing environment. The agents represent innovative firms who try to sell \ntheir innovations to other agents and end users but who also have to buy raw materials or \nmore sophisticated inputs from other agents (or material suppliers) in order to produce their \noutputs. This basic model of a market is extended with a representation of the knowledge \ndynamics in and between the firms. Each firm tries to improve its innovation performance and \nits sales by improving its knowledge base through adaptation to user needs, incremental or \nradical learning, and co-operation and networking with other agents. The elements and \nprocesses of the model will now be described in more detail, with an emphasis on the learning \nactivities. \n \nThe core concept of the framework is the knowledge, which will manifest itself in the \ninnovative production or delivery of manufactured and service products. The approach to \nknowledge representation used in the model is similar to Toulmin\u2019s evolutionary model of \nknowledge production [29]. This identified concepts, beliefs and interpretations as the \nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science   16 March 2009 3 \n\"genes\" of scientific\/technological development evolving over time in processes of selection, \nvariation and retention. Ackermann interpreted the works of Kuhn and Popper according to \nthis perspective allowing for different selection systems [1]. More recent studies [10] discuss \nthe idea of cultural replicators. A replicator is a unit which is copied \u2013 with random error \u2013 \nand which can in a way decide on the probability of its own replication. Although Dawkins \ndoes not compare his \u201cmeme\u201d as a cultural replicator with the gene as biological replicator, \nthe implication seems obvious [6, 12].  However, \u201cmemes\u201d are usually located in mental \nstates. This cognitive aspect would seem to confine the concept to individuals or require that \ncollectivities have a mental state. Instead, the SKIN model uses a similar concept, a \u201ckene\u201d, to \nrepresent the aggregate knowledge of an organization [17].  \n \n3.1. The agents \n \nThe individual knowledge base of a SKIN agent, its kene, contains a number of \u201cunits of \nknowledge\u201d. Each unit is represented as a triple consisting of a firm\u2019s capability C in a \nscientific, technological or business domain (e.g. biochemistry), represented by an integer, its \nability A to perform a certain application in this field (e.g. a synthesis procedure or filtering \ntechnique in the field of biochemistry), represented by a real number, and the expertise level E \nthe firm has achieved with respect to this ability (represented by an integer). The firm's kene \nis its collection of C\/A\/E-triples.  \n \nWhen it is set up, each firm has also a stock of initial capital. It needs this capital to produce \nfor the market and to improve its knowledge base, and it can increase its capital by selling \nproducts. The amount of capital owned by a firm is a measure of its size and also influences \nthe amount of knowledge that it can support, represented by the number of triples in its kene. \nMost firms are initially given an amount of starting capital taken from a uniform distribution \nbetween zero and an initial maximum capital allocation, but in order to model differences in \nfirm size, a few randomly chosen firms can be given extra capital. \n \n3.2. The market \n \nFirms apply their knowledge to create innovative products that have a chance of being \nsuccessful in the market. The special focus of a firm, its potential innovation, is called an \n 4 \ninnovation hypothesis. In the model, the innovation hypothesis (IH) is derived from a subset \nof the firm\u2019s kene triples.  \n \nThe underlying idea for an innovation, modeled by the innovation hypothesis, is the source an \nagent uses for its attempts to make profits on the market. Developing the innovation \nhypothesis into a product is a mapping procedure where the capabilities and abilities of the \ninnovation hypothesis are used to compute an index number that represents the product. \n \nA firm\u2019s product, P, is generated from its innovation hypothesis as \n \nP = (C1* A1) + (C3 * A3) + (C4 * A4)  + \u2026 modulus N (1) \n \nwhere N is a constant. \n \nThe product has a certain quality, which is also computed from the innovation hypothesis in a \nsimilar way, by multiplying the abilities and the expertise levels for each triple in the \ninnovation hypothesis and normalizing the result. In order to realize the product, the agent \nneeds some materials.  These can either come from outside the sector (\u201craw materials\u201d) or \nfrom other firms, which generated them as their products. What exactly an agent needs is also \ndetermined by the underlying innovation hypothesis: the kind of material required for an input \nis obtained by selecting subsets from the innovation hypotheses and applying the standard \nmapping function (see equation 1 above).  \n \nThese inputs are chosen so that each is different and differs from the firm\u2019s own product. In \norder to be able to engage in production, all the inputs need to be obtainable on the market, \ni.e. provided by other agents or available as raw materials. If the inputs are not available, the \nagent is not able to produce and has to give up this attempt to innovate. If there is more than \none supplier for a certain input, the agent will choose the one at the cheapest price and, if \nthere are several similar offers, the one with the highest quality.   \n \nIf the agent can go into production, it has to find a price for its own product that takes account \nof the input prices it is paying and a possible profit margin. While the simulation starts with \nproduct prices set at random, as the simulation proceeds, a price adjustment mechanism \nincreases the selling price if there is much demand, and reduces it (but no further than the \nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science   16 March 2009 5 \ntotal cost of production) if there are no customers.  A range of products are considered to be \n\u2018end-user\u2019 products and are sold to customers outside the sector: there is always a demand for \nsuch end-user products provided that they are offered at or below a fixed end-user price. An \nagent will then buy the requested inputs from its suppliers using its capital to do so, produces \nits output and puts it on the market for others to purchase. Using the price adjustment \nmechanism, agents are able to adapt their prices to demand and in doing so learn by feedback.  \n \nIn making a product, an agent applies the knowledge in its innovation hypothesis and this \nincreases its expertise in this area. This is the way that learning by doing\/using is modeled. \nThe expertise levels of the triples in the innovation hypothesis are increased by 1 and the \nexpertise levels of the other triples are decremented by 1. Unused triples in the kene \neventually drop to an expertise level of 0 and are deleted from the kene; the corresponding \nabilities are \u201cforgotten\u201d or \u201cdismissed\u201d [19]. \n \n3.3. Learning and co-operation: improving innovation performance \n \nIn trying to be successful on the market, the firms are dependent on their innovation \nhypothesis and thus on their kene. If a product does not meet any demand, the firm has to \nadapt its knowledge in order to produce something else for which there are customers [15]. In \nthe model, a firm has several ways of improving its performance, either alone or in co-\noperation, and in either an incremental or a more radical fashion. All strategies have in \ncommon that they are costly: the firm has to pay a \u201ctax\u201d as the cost of applying an \nimprovement strategy. \n \n3.3.1. Incremental research \n \nIf a firm\u2019s previous innovation has been successful, i.e. it has found buyers, the firm will \ncontinue selling the same product in the next round. However, if there were no sales, it \nconsiders that it is time for change (evaluating feedback). If the firm still has enough capital, \nit will carry out \u201cincremental\u201d research (R&D in the firm\u2019s labs).  \n \nPerforming incremental research [9] means that a firm tries to improve its product by altering \none of the abilities chosen from the triples in its innovation hypothesis, while sticking to its \nfocal capabilities. The ability in each triple is considered to be a point in the respective \n 6 \ncapability\u2019s action space. To move in the action space means to go up or down by an \nincrement, thus allowing for two possible \u201cresearch directions\u201d.  \n \nInitially, the research direction of a firm is set at random. Later it learns to adjust to success or \nfailure: if a move in the action space has been successful the firm will continue with the same \nresearch direction within the same triple; if it has been a failure, the firm will randomly select \na different triple from the innovation hypothesis and try again with a random research \ndirection. \n \n3.3.2. Radical research \n \nA firm under serious pressure that is in danger of becoming bankrupt will turn to more radical \nmeasures, by exploring a completely different area of market opportunities. In the model, an \nagent under financial pressure turns to a new innovation hypothesis after first \u201cinventing\u201d a \nnew capability for its kene. This is done by randomly replacing a capability in the kene with a \nnew one and then generating a new innovation hypothesis.  \n \n3.3.3. Partnerships \n \nAn agent in the model may consider partnerships (alliances, joint ventures etc.) in order to \nexploit external knowledge sources. The decision whether and with whom to co-operate is \nbased on mutual observations of the firms, which estimate the chances and requirements \ncoming from competitors, possible and past partners, and clients.  \n \nThe information a firm can gather about other agents is provided by a marketing feature: to \nadvertise its product, a firm publishes the capabilities used in its innovation hypothesis. \n(Capabilities not included in its innovation hypothesis and thus in its product, are not visible \nexternally and cannot be used to select the firm as a partner.)  The firm\u2019s advertisement is \nthen the basis for decisions by other firms to form or reject co-operative arrangements. \n \nIn experimenting with the model, we can choose between two different partner search \nstrategies, both of which compare the firm\u2019s own capabilities as used in its innovation \nhypothesis and the possible partner\u2019s capabilities as seen in its advertisement. Applying the \nconservative strategy, a firm will be attracted by a possible partner that has similar \nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science   16 March 2009 7 \ncapabilities; using a progressive strategy the attraction is based on the difference between the \ncapability sets.  \n \nPreviously good experience with former contacts generally augurs well for renewing a \npartnership. This is mirrored in the model: to find a partner, the firm will look at previous \npartners first, then at its suppliers, customers and finally at all others. If there is a firm \nsufficiently attractive according to the chosen search strategy (i.e. with attractiveness above \nthe \u2018attractiveness threshold\u2019), it will stop its search and offer a partnership. If the possible \npartner wishes to return the partnership offer, the partnership is set up.  \n \nThe model assumes that partners learn only about the knowledge being actively used by the \nother agent. Thus, to learn from a partner, a firm will add the triples of the partner\u2019s \ninnovation hypothesis to its own. For capabilities that are new to it, the expertise levels of the \ntriples taken from the partner are reduced by 1 in order to mirror the difficulty of integrating \nexternal knowledge [8].  For partner\u2019s capabilities that are already known to it, if the partner \nhas a higher expertise level, the firm will drop its own triple in favor of the partner\u2019s one; if \nthe expertise level of a similar triple is lower, the firm will stick to its own version. Once the \nknowledge transfer has been completed, each firm continues to produce its own product, \npossibly with greater expertise as a result of acquiring skills from its partner. \n \n3.3.4. Networks \n \nIf the firm\u2019s last innovation was successful, i.e. the amount of its profit in the previous round \nwas above a threshold, and the firm has some partners at hand, it can initiate the formation of \na network. This can increase its profits because the network will try to create innovations as \nan autonomous agent in addition to those created by its members and will distribute any \nrewards to its members who, in the meantime, can continue with their own attempts, thus \nproviding a double chance for profits. However, the formation of networks is costly, which \nhas two consequences: only firms with enough capital can form or join a network and no firm \ncan be member of two networks at the same time. \n \nNetworks are \u201cnormal\u201d agents, i.e. they get the same amount of initial capital as other firms \nand can engage in all the activities available to other firms. The kene of a network is the union \nof the triples from the innovation hypotheses of all its participants. If a network is successful \n 8 \nit will distribute any earnings above the amount of the initial capital to its members; if it fails \nand becomes bankrupt, it will be dissolved.  \n \n3.4. Start-ups \n \nIf a sector is successful, new firms will be attracted into it. This is modeled by adding a new \nfirm to the population when any existing firm makes a substantial profit. The new firm is a \nclone of the successful firm, but with its kene triples restricted to those in the successful \nfirm\u2019s advertisement, and an expertise level of 1. This models a new firm copying the \ncharacteristics of those seen to be successful in the market. As with all firms, the kene may \nalso be restricted because the initial capital of a start-up is limited and may not be sufficient to \nsupport the copying of the whole of the successful firm\u2019s innovation hypothesis. \n \n3 Organizational Learning  \n \nIn 1938, the American philosopher John Dewey introduced the concept of experiential \nlearning as a permanent activity cycle [13], starting a discussion among educationalists about \nfeedback learning and learning by doing. This discussion, however, referred mostly to \nindividuals.  It was in 1973 that Donald Michael introduced the idea of organizational \nlearning (OL) [24]. Since then, the field of OL has grown steadily. In the 1970s, Argyris and \nSch\u00f6n\u2019s influential monograph [4] proposed that a learning organisation is one that is \npermanently changing its interpretation of the environment. In doing so, the organization \nlearns new things and forgets old ones. Drawing on their background as action theorists, \nArgyris and Sch\u00f6n show how these interpretations are gained and how they are connected to \ndifferent organizational behaviors.  \n \nWe can apply the SKIN model to many of the ideas of the Argyris\/Sch\u00f6n framework and use \nit to examine the assumption that, in the words of de Geus [11], the greatest competitive \nadvantage for any firm is its ability to learn. As we have seen in the previous section, in the \nSKIN model, firms can: \n1. use their capabilities (learning by doing\/using); \n2. learn to estimate their success via feedback from markets and clients (learning by \nfeedback) \nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science   16 March 2009 9 \n3. improve their own knowledge incrementally when the feedback is not satisfactory in order \nto adapt to rising technological and\/or economic standards (adaptation learning, \nincremental learning) \n4. radically change their capabilities in order to meet completely different requirements of \nmarkets and clients (innovative learning, radical learning) \n \nFirms may also be also active on the meta level (called in the OL literature, the double-loop \nlearning level) of the model. They can: \n1. forget their capabilities (clean up their knowledge space) \n2. decide on their individual learning strategies themselves (e.g. incremental or radical \nlearning), constructing and changing the strategies according to their past experience and \ncurrent context.  The context consists of external factors such as the actions of clients, \ncompetitors and partners, and the availability of technical options, and internal factors \nsuch as their capital stock and the competencies available to them. \n3. engage in networking and partnerships to absorb and exploit external knowledge sources, \nto imitate and emulate, and to use synergy effects (participative learning).  \n  \nFurthermore, the SKIN simulation models some insights from empirical learning research, for \nexample, addressing the difficulty of including external knowledge into the firm (e.g.[7]), the \nongoing diffusion of innovation-relevant knowledge in the market, and the influence of firms \nentering the market. \n \nModels and simulation tools have long been used for strategic planning (cf. [20, 25, 26, 27] \netc.). In addition, a lot of work has been done lately in the area of intelligent management and \ndecision support systems (for a recent review see [18]). In contrast to these, the SKIN \napproach allows strategic computational agents to act experimentally in complex knowledge-\nbased scenarios. It is possible to track single firms in the simulation in order to observe their \nstrategic learning behaviors in different situations and their outcomes, or to consider the effect \nof different forms of learning on a sector as a whole, the approach taken in this paper.  \n \n4 Some Experiments \n \nThe SKIN simulation may be used to test the impact of various learning activities on the \nsurvival and effectiveness of firms in a highly competitive and dynamic market.  In the \nsection, we present some simulations examining the effects of organizational learning on the \n 10 \nperformance of the model. In trying to vary and\/or to stabilize their knowledge stocks by \norganizational learning, the simulated firms attempt to adapt to environmental requirements \nwhile the simulated market rewards those that are most successful.   \n \nWe begin with some baseline experiments, in which no firm is able to learn.  All firms start \nwith a randomly generated kene and have no possibility of changing it through learning.  \nMoreover, the prices of products are fixed and cannot be changed to suit the market.  Not \nsurprisingly, in this scenario, there is very little trading activity, because few firms are able to \nfind suppliers for their needed inputs, and those that can are likely to find their requirements \ntoo expensive to be affordable.  The market as a whole fails to \u2018take off\u2019, almost all firms fail \nto trade, and the consequence is that firms do not make a profit.  Nevertheless all firms have \nto pay a tax just to remain in the market, which is taken from their starting capital.  When it \nhas used up all its capital, a firm \u2018dies\u2019 and is removed from the simulation.   Eventually, the \nsimulation ends with no remaining firms. \n \nThe pattern for scenarios when firms are only capable of learning by using and learning by \nfeedback is similar.  These types of learning operate at the market level, but do not affect the \ninnovation performance of the firms.  While adjustment of prices can help when a firm is \nmaking a product that is in demand, but which is too expensive for the customers, it is of no \navail if the product is the wrong one \u2013 there is no demand for it \u2013 or the product cannot be \nmade because the requisite inputs are not available.  This is usually the situation in these basic \nscenarios, where the selection of products available is determined by the random chance of \nthe initial kene configurations, and where there is no opportunity to engage in innovation to \nproduce new, more desirable products. As Figure 2 shows, the population of firms decreases \nsteadily until no more remain. \n \nThe picture changes once we allow adaptive learning by means of simulated research.  Now \nthe firms are able to modify their knowledge bases, generate new products and adapt the \ninputs that they require to make these products.  For many firms, the learning that they are \nable to do will be unsuccessful and their fate will be the same as in the baseline scenario:  \nlittle or no profit, a regular tax, although one larger than before to pay for the research they \nare doing, and eventual bankruptcy and removal from the simulation.  Some firms, however, \nwill strike lucky and find a product for which there are reasonably priced inputs available and \na customer able to purchase.   Profits accrue to these firms, which become steadily richer \nwhile their products remain in demand.  However, the environment for these firms consists of \nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science   16 March 2009 11 \nall the other firms and their products.  This is a highly dynamic environment and it is likely \nthat before too long, either a firm from which it is buying an input or a firm to which it is \nselling its product will change its kene (and thus its inputs and product) or go out of business \naltogether.  This will initiate a cascade of changes that may leave it without a viable product.  \nHowever, it can live off its accrued capital while it searches for an alternative.   \n \nThus, in a scenario in which adaptation of firms\u2019 kenes is possible, we obtain an initial sharp \nreduction in the number of firms as those that are not viable drop out, followed by recovery as \nfirms accumulate capital from successful trading, and because of their success, attract \nnewcomers into the market.  A detailed look at the first 100 time periods (Figure 1), reveals \nthat initially, overall, very few firms are capable of making products because the inputs they \nneed are not available on the market.  During the early steps, the firms \u2018redesign\u2019 their \nproducts to accommodate the inputs on the market and can then offer the products for sale.  \nThen they redesign their products to match the requirements of their customers and many \nfirms succeed in making sales.  Those that either fail to adjust their innovation hypotheses so \nthat they only require inputs that can be bought, or which make products that no other firm \nwants to buy, run out of capital and \u2018die\u2019.   The number of firms stabilizes at between 500 and \n600 (measured in repeated runs under the same conditions).  This can be seen in Figure 2, \nwhich plots the number of firms by time, in an experiment where all firms are capable of \nlearning through incremental research, in addition to learning by doing and by feedback. \n \n \nFigure 1 The first 150 time steps, showing the initial shake out of firms when the simulated \nsector can perform incremental research and price adjustment\n 12 \n \n \nFigure 2 The population of firms over the first 2000 time steps, for various combinations of \norganizational learning \n \nWhile incremental research does allow a firm to improve its product through varying its \nabilities, it is stuck with its initial, randomly assigned, basket of capabilities.  Radical research \n(innovative learning) allows the firm to branch out, absorbing or creating new capabilities that \ncan lead to completely new products.  We allow the firms to engage in such radical research \nstrategies only when they are close to running out of funds, and thus close to \u2018death\u2019.  If their \nremaining capital falls below a threshold value, they acquire a new capability in exchange for \nan existing one, then generate a new innovation hypothesis and, if they can find the required \ninputs and a customer, a new product.  Such radical research is very risky and in the model, \nonly succeeds about 5 per cent of the time (i.e. the innovation hypothesis generated from a \nradical research effort only makes a surplus in about 1 in 20 cases).  Nevertheless, the \npossibility of doing radical research has an effect on the overall success of the firms.  The \nmedian number of steps before firms lose all their capital rises from about 40 to about 60 \nbecause of the opportunity for a \u2018fresh start\u2019 that undertaking a radical research programme \noffers to those that manage to discover a successful innovation hypothesis. \nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science   16 March 2009 13 \n \nFigure 3  Median age of firms at the time step when they lose all their capital, by type of \norganizational learning \n \nA way of acquiring new knowledge in addition to incremental or radical research is to obtain \nit from other firms though some form of collaboration.  Such participatory learning is \nmodeled by the formation of partnerships between similar firms.  Partners exchange \ncapabilities, thus introducing new ideas into the firm from outside, rather than through \ninternal research.  Figure 2 also shows the changes in the population of firms when all the \nfirms are able to engage in partnerships, but do no incremental or radical research.  It will be \nseen that the innovations that are introduced through partnership are slightly more successful \n(as judged by the growth in the population of firms) than those that are obtained by internal \nresearch, perhaps because partnering allows the introduction of new capabilities from \npartners, while incremental research only improves the abilities for capabilities that the firm \nalready possesses.  The firms employ the \u2018conservative\u2019 strategy in these experiments, which \nmeans that they partner with other firms that have similar innovation hypotheses, thus \nlimiting the amount of novelty.  Moreover, firms preferentially partner with others that they \nhave previously collaborated with, again limiting the possibility of novelty.  Nevertheless, \nsufficient innovation is introduced that the sector as a whole is able to create a sustainable \nmarket and grow slightly faster than if each form operated with only its own innovation \nresources. \n 14 \n \nAllowing firms to engage in partnership formation together with incremental and radical \nresearch provides the best resources for innovation and yields the fastest growth in the \nnumber of firms.  With this combination of types of learning, not only are firms able to \nacquire capabilities from partners, they are also able to improve the abilities using their own \ninternal research activities. \n \nPartnerships are dissolved at the end of each time step and only affect the knowledge base of \nthe partners.  However, experienced partners are also able to create networks that can make \nproducts on their own account, contributing any profit to the network members.  Figure 6 also \nshows the population growth when all firms are allowed to become network members if they \nwish.  The curve is shows slower growth than partnering plus internal firm research because \nthe network activities have the effect of generating additional competition for the firms. \nFigure 4 shows the typical near power law distribution of size of the networks, also found in \nreal innovation networks. \n \nFigure 4 Log-log plot of network size (number of firms per network) after 2000 time steps. \n \n5 Conclusions \n \nIn this paper, a framework for modeling learning competence in firms is presented to improve \nthe understanding of managing innovation. Focusing on their learning competencies, firms \nwith different knowledge stocks attempt to improve their economic performance by choosing \nor suppressing radical or incremental innovation activities and by engaging in partnerships \nand networks with other firms. In trying to vary and\/or to stabilize their knowledge stocks by \norganizational learning, they attempt to adapt to environmental requirements while the market \nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science   16 March 2009 15 \nstrongly selects on the results. The simulation experiments show the impact of different \nlearning activities, underlining the importance of innovation and learning.  It demonstrates the \nimportance of finding new capabilities from outside the firm, either through partnering or \nradical research.  It also shows that the simpler forms of organizational learning, such as \nlearning by doing and learning by feedback, are of limited value by themselves in the highly \ndynamic environment of modern knowledge based market sectors, although they are of \nsignificance when combined with other forms of learning.  \n \nThe model also demonstrates the possibilities opened up by simulation for carrying out \nexperiments on a model that would be impossible to perform in the real world.  Clearly, it \nwould not be practicable to constrain actual firms in their learning capacities in order to study \nthe effect on their success and determine the causal consequences, still less to do this for a \nwhole market sector. But as this paper has shown, it is possible and revealing to do so on a \nmodel of a sector.  This paper has only made a start in examining the complex relationships \nbetween firm and sector success and organizational learning; there are many more \npossibilities that await investigation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAppendix \n \nThe code for the NetLogo model on which this paper is based is available on request from the \nfirst author. \n \nThe simulation runs described in this paper use the following parameter settings: \n \n\u2022 Initial capital of firms: taken from a uniform random distribution between 0 and \n20,000 \n\u2022 Initial population of firms: 650 \n\u2022 Number of large firms, with extra capital at the start: 0 \n\u2022 Range of product index numbers in the sector: 0.0 to 100.0 \n\u2022 Maximum difference between product and input index numbers for them to be \nconsidered substitutable: 1.0 \n\u2022 All products with a product number below 5.0 are considered to be \u2018raw-materials\u2019 \nand all those with numbers above 95 are \u2018end-user\u2019 products. \n\u2022 Price of raw materials: 1 \n\u2022 Maximum price of end-user products: 1000  \n\u2022 Profit required to attract new start-ups: 400 \n 16 \n\u2022 Partnering search strategy: conservative \n\u2022 Attractiveness threshold to allow two firms to partner: 0.3 \n\u2022 Capital cut-off below which firms do radical rather than incremental research: 1000 \n\u2022 Taxes: per time step: 200; per incremental research attempt: 100; per radical research \nattempt: 100: per partner: 100 \n \n \n \nReferences  \n \n[1] R.
