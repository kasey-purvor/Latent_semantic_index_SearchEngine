The concept of \u2018spiritual landscapes\u2019 highlights the links, \nfound throughout Southeast Asia, between spirit beings or potent energies and particular \nsites in the landscape, including trees, mountains and rivers. The concept also broadens \nanthropological approaches to the religious significance of the landscape in two main \nways. Firstly, it problematises the separation of \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018cultural\u2019 environments, and \nsecondly, it side-steps the implication that something called \u2018sacred geography\u2019 can be \nseparated from the pragmatic activities of daily life. In this Introduction, having given an \nethnographic overview of spirit-places and environmental forces in the region, I suggest \nthat we need to take more seriously the claims of many Southeast Asian people that their \nlandscapes have agency. In the context of religious conversion, the agency of the \nlandscape often becomes a central concern, as reformers and missionaries seek to \u2018purify\u2019 \nthe environment of such spiritual power. However, in addition to \u2018purification\u2019, ongoing \nconversion may also involve new forms of conversation with the landscape, including re-\nenchantments, religious syntheses, or reassertions of the landscape\u2019s potency. \n \nKey Words \nLandscape; Southeast Asia; Religious change; Spiritual potency; Agency \n \n 2\n \nDespite the varied histories and religions of Southeast Asian societies, a reading of many \nhistorical and ethnographic accounts reveals a common understanding that the world \ninhabited by humans was intersected by a spiritual or invisible realm. This understanding \noften manifested itself in what can be called a distinctive \u2018spiritual landscape\u2019 of potent \nplaces, pathways, rivers, trees and mountains. This Special Edition1 seeks to examine \nwhat has happened to the varied spiritual landscapes of island Southeast Asia in the \ncontext of new religious forms, migration, changing agricultural practices, and military \nand political projects. How do understandings of spiritual landscapes transform when \npeople move (either freely or forcibly) away from their ancestral lands? How do people \nnegotiate their allegiances to \u2018world\u2019 religions versus the particularities of potent places? \nWhat are the limits to a Catholic, Protestant or Islamic landscape? What kinds of \npurifications, re-enchantments, syncretisms or anti-syncretisms of the spiritual landscape \ndoes ongoing religious conversion entail? \n \n\u2018Landscape\u2019, as a concept in the human sciences, tends to be utilised in one of three \ndistinct ways. Firstly, it may be used in the common, everyday sense of a \u2018natural\u2019 or \nphysical environment, a taken-for-granted backdrop of hills, rivers and valleys. This is \nthe way in which landscapes are referred to in most ethnographies. Secondly, \u2018landscape\u2019 \nmay be used to refer to a distinct \u2018way of seeing\u2019, a representation, as in \u2018landscape \npainting\u2019. This is the sense of landscape employed most notably in Marxist critique, as in \nCosgrove and Daniels\u2019 definition of a landscape as \u2018a pictorial way of representing or \nsymbolising surroundings\u2019 (1988, 1), or Raymond Williams\u2019 historical argument that the \nvery idea of the \u2018English landscape\u2019 both excluded \u2018working country\u2019 and implied \n\u2018separation and observation\u2019 (1985, 26). However, this representational approach is also \nthe perspective adopted in classic anthropological work that sees the prior divisions of \nsociety as \u2018mapped onto\u2019 the \u2018space\u2019 of houses and villages (Durkheim and Mauss \n([1903] 1963). Thirdly, \u2018landscape\u2019 may be utilised to refer neither to a \u2018natural\u2019 object, \nnor to a cultural \u2018representation\u2019, but to a historical process of interaction between people \nand the environment in which both are shaped. This is the understanding of landscape \nthat I employ in this Introduction, drawing in particular on Ingold\u2019s \u2018dwelling \n 3\nperspective\u2019, and his negative definition of landscape as neither \u2018land\u2019, nor \u2018nature\u2019, nor \n\u2018space\u2019 (2000, 190). The focus on both historical process and human activity in this \nunderstanding of landscape necessitates acknowledging that the same physical \nenvironment affords many possible landscapes, an acknowledgment of real importance to \nthe changing spiritual landscapes described in this volume. \n \nLandscapes are cumulative, historical matrixes of places and pathways. They are always \nin process, full of memory, and are entangled in complex, ever-changing ways with \nhuman lives. There is thus no meaningful distinction that can be drawn between a \n\u2018natural\u2019 landscape of physical features onto which people project a \u2018cultural\u2019 landscape \nof representations and symbols (Ingold 2000, 189). If this seems an unusual statement to \nmake, take a moment to think of some of Southeast Asia\u2019s most iconic, endlessly-\nphotographed landscapes: the steep rice terraces of the Ifugao of the Philippines, or the \nBalinese. As on-lookers, we may admire the way in which hundreds of years of human \nlabour have sculpted these mountain terraces, contributing to an ever-shifting patchwork \nof muddy, lush and shimmering fields.2 However, the Ifugao or Balinese who inhabit \nthese landscapes do not confront them as a world \u2018out there\u2019 (Ingold 2000, 173). Rather, \nthis landscape becomes meaningful to them partly through practical activity, as they \nclimb up steep paths, walk through deep mud, or bend over in the hot sun to transplant \nrice seedlings. To pre-empt the possible criticism that this understanding of landscape \nsomewhat romantically privileges the rural, consider also how urban landscapes may be \nconstituted for their inhabitants in daily acts of crossing a busy street, buying vegetables \nin a market, or driving through a suburb. Over time, a landscape, which is never complete \nbut always being made and re-made, will become saturated with memories, its places \noften acting as \u2018mnemonic pegs\u2019 (Basso 1996, 62) for stories and reminiscences. This \npractice-oriented approach to landscape is one that has been gaining ground in landscape \narchaeology in recent years, particularly in Tilley\u2019s defence of a revitalized, holistic \nconcept of landscape that \u2018links bodies, movement and places together\u2019 (2004, 24; see \nalso Lemaire 1997). However, for anthropologists, such an approach also needs \nsupplementing with an attention to the larger forces (missionary, governmental, \n 4\ncapitalist) that may shape landscapes in both intentional and unintentional ways (see \nBender 2001; Baxstrom 2008). \n \nLandscapes and human lives are entangled in ever-changing ways. In particular, \nlandscapes are entangled with notions and practices that concern such areas of \nanthropological interest as religion, kinship and morality. This can be clearly seen in \nthose ethnographies that follow the lead of their main characters, and put place and \nlandscape at the forefront of their analyses. For example, in Wisdom sits in places, one of \nthe most evocative ethnographies of landscape, Keith Basso (1996) describes how \ndiscovering the places, and learning the place-names, of the Apache landscape involves a \nkind of moral education. Other anthropologists have emphasized how, for example, \nlandscape and kinship are entangled: \u2018country\u2019 becomes the \u2018objectification of kin \nnetworks\u2019 in Myers\u2019 (1986, 68) account of the Pintupi of Aboriginal Australia;3 Gow \n(1995) argues that the Amazonian Piro see kinship (in the form of evidence of habitation) \nwhen they look at the land; Leach argues, simply but forcefully, that for the Melanesian \nReite, \u2018kinship is geography\u2019 (2003, 31). \n \nThis special edition offers a new perspective on the entanglement of landscapes and \nhuman lives by introducing the concept of \u2018spiritual landscapes\u2019. This concept is meant to \ndraw attention both to the ways in which people imagine spirit forces and energies to \nemerge from or be connected to places, and to the attitudes that people may have to the \n\u2018hidden\u2019 or mysterious realms lying beyond, behind or immanent within the visible earth. \nWhilst some of the ethnographic particularities of the papers might tempt us to speak of \n\u2018enspirited landscapes\u2019, this suggests that the landscape only has spiritual potency so far \nas spirit-beings are thought to reside in it. By contrast, the notion of spiritual landscapes \nallows for the possibility that, with the diminishment of the significance of \u2018spirits\u2019, the \nlandscape may nevertheless continue to be granted a spiritual role, and to thereby allow \nfor the imagination of continuity in the face of change. \n \nThus, one of the main advantages of the concept of spiritual landscapes is that it broadens \nanthropological approaches to the \u2018religious\u2019 significance of place and landscape. There \n 5\nare two main aspects to this broadening. Firstly, since the notion of landscape employed \nin this Introduction (though not necessarily uniformly in the papers that follow) questions \nthe distinction between a \u2018natural\u2019 and a \u2018cultural\u2019 environment, so it also problematises \nthe separation of \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018supernatural\u2019 phenomena. As Woodward argues, one of \nthe main flaws with anthropological discussions of \u2018traditional religions\u2019 is \u2018the failure to \nobserve that for most people the \u201cnatural world\u201d includes objects and forces that cannot \nbe observed by sense perception alone\u2019 (1989, 23). Though a recent attempt to revitalize \nthe concept of \u2018supernatural\u2019 as an etic category stresses that the concept does not have to \nbe employed in a way that assumes the emic separation of natural and supernatural \n(Lohmann 2003a, 176), I am in sympathy with Aragon\u2019s desire to \u2018keep modernist \nideologies\u2026 from prejudging the boundaries of all religions\u2019 (2003, 132). The spirit-\nbeings and energies that are part of many Southeast Asian spiritual landscapes are \nengaged with as an intrinsic, everyday aspect of those landscapes, rather than as \nparanormal or unnatural phenomena. Of course, what needs to be explored are the ways \nin which such beings and energies may in turn be \u2018diabolised\u2019 by the world religions and \npossibly become detached from the landscape.  \n \nSecondly, by contrast with such notions as \u2018ancestor worship\u2019 or \u2018sacred sites\u2019, speaking \nof spiritual landscapes is a way to sidestep the problematic Christian heritage of our \nanthropological concepts (see Cannell 2006). An object, site or place may be said to be \n\u2018sacred\u2019 if it is thought to possess \u2018particular powers demanding respect, reverence and \nritual\u2019 (Askew 2003, 64). However, though these may at times be the attitudes taken up \ntowards the spiritual landscapes we describe, they are by no means necessary for us to \nacknowledge such a landscape. To speak of \u2018sacred landscapes\u2019 would imply a \nperception of the environment set apart from the profane activities of daily life. By \ncontrast, many of the spiritual landscapes of Southeast Asia are emphatically \u2018vernacular\u2019 \nlandscapes, in the sense popularised by the American geographer J.B. Jackson, for whom \nlandscapes included the roads, sidewalks and houses of the \u2018workaday world\u2019 (Meinig \n1971, 228; see Jackson 1997). A spiritual landscape is not necessarily one that we would \nrecognise as \u2018religious\u2019. It may gain negative potency from deaths and burials during \nmilitary conflict (Bovensiepen, this issue), or it may necessitate acknowledging the \n 6\noriginal owners of donated farming land (Allerton, this issue). People may engage with \nspiritual landscapes in ritual activities, but also in a more pragmatic fashion in the course \nof everyday life.4 Moreover, even when a converted population abandons older ritual \nforms, many taken-for-granted notions regarding spirits and their places may be retained \n(see Forth 1998, 19). \n \nGeographies of Spiritual Power in Southeast Asia \n \nMany mid- to late-twentieth century accounts of Southeast Asian societies, particularly \nhistorical accounts of the region\u2019s Indic states, stress the significance of what is \nfrequently labelled \u2018sacred geography\u2019, or \u2018a conceptual system in which certain places \nare of central ritual importance because it is there that one accesses cosmic currents of \nritual purity and power\u2019 (Lehman 2003a, xvi). These studies emphasise the importance of \ncosmological symbolism to the construction and political significance of temples, palaces \nand kingdoms. In his classic study of conceptions of state and kingship in Southeast Asia, \nHeine-Geldern argued that the structural and spatial organization of Indic states was a \nmicrocosmic mirroring of the macrocosmos, in which the capital stood as the \u2018magical \ncenter of the empire\u2019 (1956[1942], 3). Later, Tambiah utilised the notion of mandala, a \ncomposition of two elements, core and container, to describe such a \u2018galactic polity\u2019, a \nsocio-spatial configuration visible in temples such as Borobudur on Java (1976, 102). \nSimilarly, Geertz argues that the nineteenth century Balinese state was a \u2018theatre state\u2019, in \nwhich the king and court stood as the \u2018exemplary center\u2019 (1980, 11-18). Woodward, \nwriting on the palace (keraton) of Yogyakarta, argues that despite the political upheavals \nof the Indonesian state, notions of \u2018Javanese-Islamic sacred geography\u2019 continue to shape \nthe potency of the palace as the centre of spiritual purity (2003, 227). \n \nHowever, as Wolters stresses, mandalas and galactic polities were \u2018a phenomenon of the \nlowlands\u2019 (1999, 39), even if some aspects of their influence may have reached to upland \npeoples. Away from these exemplary centres, Southeast Asian peoples held vernacular \nunderstandings, not of cosmologically-significant \u2018sacred geography\u2019, but of the spirit or \n\u2018soul-stuff\u2019 animating living things (Reid 1988, 6), as well as the spiritual potency of \n 7\nmountains, caves, forests, trees, graves and rivers. Such understandings are described in \nthe literature as distinct from, or else in tension with, the world religions, and are \ntherefore conceptualised, variously, as \u2018animism\u2019 (Skeat 1900), \u2018supernaturalism\u2019 (Spiro \n1967), \u2018spirit cults\u2019 (Tambiah 1970) or as part of an \u2018indigenous religious system\u2019 \n(Benjamin 1979). For example, Skeat described the folk religion of the Malays, as \ndistinct from orthodox Islam, as a \u2018natural religion\u2019 in which most natural things were \nthought to possess souls, and such distinctive places as oddly-shaped rocks or very large \ntrees were thought to be sacred or kramat (1900, 71). Later, building on Skeat\u2019s work, \nBenjamin argued that in the Malay system of animism \u2018almost everything in the \nenvironment that note is taken of has the power to concentrate essence in itself\u2019 (1979, \n11). \n  \nBoth older and more recent ethnographies provide details on specific places associated \nwith spirit beings and forces in island Southeast Asia.5 One common location of such \npotent forces is, most generally, the forest or, more precisely, particular species of tree. In \nnineteenth and twentieth century Java, Ficus tree species were considered sacred, and had \ntheir own legends of origin (Boomgaard 1995, 53). According to Boomgaard, not only \ndid the Javanese think spirit-inhabited trees should be approached with care, they also \nacknowledged entire forest areas that were angker or \u2018taboo\u2019, with mortal consequences \nfor those humans who ignored such taboos (1995, 55). Similarly, the Ranau Dusun of \nSabah thought that a particular class of prankster spirits (called \u2018Miyons\u2019) inhabited trees \nof the Ficus species, and saw the forest as \u2018an almost cosmic entity\u2019 because of its many \npotent energies and spiritual dangers (Harrison 1979, 61, 70). Dix Grimes describes how \nspirits of the jungle are analogous to \u2018taboo people\u2019 in Buru cosmology, and consequently \nmany practices are taboo in the jungle (1997, 129). Among the Huaulu of Seram, \u2018occult \npowers\u2019 fundamentally \u2018belong to the forest\u2019, and though they desire to enter human \nvillages, are fearful of doing so unless there are wild trees in which they can hide (Valeri \n2000, 23-26).  In this issue, the spiritual potency of trees is stressed by Kari Telle, whose \npaper vividly describes the collapse of a \u2018sentient\u2019 tree in the middle of a Sasak \ngraveyard, and ensuing worries over the correct ritual response. \n \n 8\nClear distinctions do not always seem to be drawn in Southeast Asian societies between \nthe realms of forest and mountain as spirit domains. For example, the Gumai of South \nSumatra see the different \u2018spheres\u2019 of the world, including a combined sphere of \nmountain\/ forest, as \u2018controlled by invisible supernatural spirits\u2019 (Sakai 1997, 45). In the \nKaro highlands of Sumatra, keramat refers to \u2018powerful and benevolent\u2019 spirits, \nassociated in particular with Mount Sibayak, sometimes conceived as nature spirits, \nsometimes as humans metamorphosed into spirits, and sometimes as \u2018supernatural sites\u2019 \nthemselves (Steedly 1993, 119). In the past, other, more dangerous and mischievous \nspirits were also associated with the mountain\u2019s trees, rocks and streams. Steedly notes \nthat \u2018entering this spirit-filled world called for a certain fortitude\u2019, and so travellers would \nleave small offerings for the spirits at places along mountain passes (1993, 122). \nSimilarly, in the Philippines, Mount Apo is thought to be the abode of mountain spirits \nand to possess an everyday (though increasingly contested) sacredness (Alejo 2000). The \ncontested potency of mountains, and their changing spiritual significance, is a central \ntheme of both Howell\u2019s and Amster\u2019s papers in this issue. \n \nSpirits have also frequently been described as associated with bodies of water, including \nlakes, rivers and the sea, an association described for the Manggarai of west Flores by \nAllerton in this issue. Such water-spirits may be conceptually fused with other place-\nspirits, as in Endicott\u2019s account of Malay animism, which makes no clear distinction \nbetween jungle spirits and spirits of water (1970, 106). Forth argues that among the Nage \nof central Flores, free spirits known as nitu may be described as the \u2018owners of trees and \nstones\u2019, but are pre-eminently associated with bodies of water including, in coastal areas, \nthe sea (1998, 65-6). Writing of the island of Luang in the Banda Sea, Pannell notes that \nhumans do not have the right to \u2018access and use the products of the sea with total \nfreedom\u2019, since the right to use a sea product is \u2018mediated\u2019 by the relationship between \nthe user and a \u2018powerful being\u2019 who lives in the sea (2007, 86). Similarly, Spyer has \ndescribed how male divers in the Aru islands speak of (frequently erotic) encounters with \nundersea spirit women, or \u2018sea wives\u2019, who demand sacrifices from these divers in return \nfor a supply of pearl oysters (2000, 144-6). \n \n 9\nThroughout the region, spirits of forests, mountains and rivers may be contrasted with a \nmore general category of spirit known as the \u2018owners\u2019 or \u2018masters\u2019 of the land or earth. \nHicks describes such a class of spirits for the Tetum of Timor: the \u2018lords of the earth\u2019 \nwho own such places as bamboo groves, old trees or lakes (1976, 25). Among the Buid of \nMindoro, the \u2018spirits of the earth\u2019 are those to whom the land \u2018belongs\u2019, and whom \nhumans must be careful not to offend, whether through the violation of agricultural \ntaboos or even the quarrelling of spouses (Gibson 1986, 38, 48, 174). If they remain \nunoffended, such spirits provide the Buid with a \u2018general and diffuse sort of protection\u2019 \n(Gibson 1986, 173). These kinds of \u2018spirits of the earth\u2019 may be one form taken by the \nphenomenon of \u2018founders\u2019 cults\u2019, described by Tannenbaum and Kammerer as \u2018part of \nthe Southeast Asian matrix of cultural possibilities that reflects widespread beliefs in \nspirit ownership of territory and control of fertility and prosperity\u2019 (2003, 8). Lehman, in \nthe same volume, argues that in mainland Southeast Asia \u2018the original and ultimate \nowners having dominion over the face of the land are spirit lords commonly associated \nwith more or less prominent features of the landscape\u2019 (2003b, 16). Though Lehman and \nthe other authors in this volume (Tannenbaum and Kammerer 2003) are most concerned \nwith the changing political implications of claims to relationships with such spirits, in this \nspecial edition we seek to emphasise the contestation that may occur over the landscape \nitself. \n \nAncestors are clearly a significant presence in many Southeast Asian landscapes, and are \noften associated with mountains (Wolters 1999, 19), or are thought to have come from \nthe sea (Boomgaard 2007, 5). Lehman argues against the \u2018error\u2019 on the part of the analyst \nof conflating founders\u2019 cults with cults of the ancestors (2003b, 33), but there are clearly \nmany ethnographic examples where ancestral spirits are intertwined with other categories \nof land or earth spirit (see both Allerton and Bovensiepen, this issue). Such intertwining \nseems to be more common in societies, such as the Manggarai and Nage, where the \ncategory of \u2018ancestor\u2019 embraces both early, founding ancestors and more recently-\ndeceased \u2018mundane\u2019 forebears (Forth 1998, 243). By contrast, Wolters argued that in \nmany Southeast Asian societies, ancestor status \u2018had to be earned\u2019, and was not \nautomatically granted to \u2018mere forebears\u2019 (1999, 19). When ancestral status is only \n 10\ngranted to a potent few, the spiritual landscape may be one punctuated by powerful sites \nincluding individual graves and shrines. Woodward stresses that power in Java, thought \nof as an animating \u2018physical substance\u2019, is particularly concentrated at holy (and \nespecially royal) graves and shrines (1989, 166). Visiting such graves is therefore not, as \nGeertz had argued, a form of \u2018ancestor worship\u2019 (1960, 76), but a way of personally \naccessing such potency. \n \nThe Christian-influenced notions of \u2018sacred sites\u2019 and \u2018ancestor worship\u2019 suggest an \nattitude of reverence and contemplation towards a landscape of ancestral and other \nspirits. By contrast, reading ethnographic accounts, it becomes clear that Southeast Asian \nlandscapes of spirits and energies are acknowledged and dealt with pragmatically through \nboth everyday and ritual actions. Endicott noted that, because Malay earth spirits resided \ndirectly under villages and fields, people constantly took them into consideration when \nplanting crops, digging the ground or even performing plays (1970, 106). Cannell \ndescribes how Bicolanos acknowledge the \u2018unseen geography\u2019 of their area through short \ngreetings addressed to the spirits, or particular forms of avoidance behaviour (1999, 85). \nDix Grimes argues that Buru spirits of the jungle are like a kind of \u2018taboo people\u2019, and \nthere are many things that humans cannot do in their (unseen) presence (1997, 128-9). In \nsome Southeast Asian societies, the existence of hidden forces in the landscape may not \nnecessitate any special rituals, but may nonetheless be feared for the communicative acts \nthat such forces transmit. Thus, among the Ranau Dusun of Sabah, the presence of spirits \nin the landscape was thought to be signalled by \u2018one of a host of possible omens\u2019 \nrequiring uncertain interpretation, including bird omens, rainbows and snakes (Harrison \n1979, 60). In this issue, a key comparative concern is the extent to which a pragmatic, \nand occasionally fearful, attitude towards the landscape may have been replaced by one \nof greater reverence and contemplation. \n \nLandscape, Religion and Agency \n \nIn their concern with reading signs and omens, their ritual efforts to placate the spirits, \nand their everyday acknowledgements of the influences of an unseen realm, many \n 11\nSoutheast Asian peoples accord a kind of agency to the spiritual landscape. That is, they \nsee it as having the power to act in the world. In several of the contributions to this issue, \nwe also see such an attribution of agency, for example in Telle\u2019s argument that the Sasak \nsee their landscape as possessing \u2018a sort of wilful presence\u2019. Comparative ethnography \nshows that approaching the landscape as an animate realm in-and-of-itself is not confined \nto Southeast Asian societies. For example, Harvey argues that for many Andean people \n\u2018the landscape self-evidently has agency (intentionality and capacity for autonomous \naction) and must be actively engaged if that agency is to be directed favourably towards \nhuman endeavour\u2019 (2001, 198). Povinelli (1995) engages with the agency accorded to \nAustralian Aboriginal landscapes by showing how the sweat and speech produced by \nhuman labour in turn affect the productivity of the land. Echoing Povinelli\u2019s attention to \nwhether rocks might smell or listen, Cruikshank\u2019s work on the intersection of nature and \nculture in the Yukon and Alaska asks \u2018Do glaciers listen?\u2019 (2005). \n \nFor Guthrie (1993), viewing landscapes, rocks or glaciers as agents is part of a common \nevolutionary strategy by which humans are inherently biased to see the world as social. \nHis \u2018new theory of religion\u2019 claims that religion \u2018may best be understood as systematic \nanthropomorphism: the attribution of human characteristics to nonhuman things or \nevents\u2019 (1993, 3). Such anthropomorphism is, according to Guthrie, a \u2018good bet\u2019 since, in \nan uncertain and ambiguous world, it makes sense to assume that things are alive until \nproved otherwise (1993, 3). Guthrie views animism as a form of such thinking, an \nunconscious inclination of all people to \u2018see nonliving things and events as alive\u2019 (1993, \n39). Ultimately, though, such animistic interpretations are for Guthrie \u2018the failures of a \ngenerally good strategy\u2019, since the things and events to which such interpretations \nattribute life are, \u2018in hindsight\u2019, discovered to be inanimate (1993, 6). However, not only \ndoes Guthrie assume an a priori distinction between (interior) mind and (exterior) \nenvironment6, but his characterisation of animism as an overextended cognitive strategy \nmakes it hard to explain why people might hold onto such \u2018failed\u2019 interpretations, even in \nthe face of apparently more \u2018scientific\u2019 arguments. To put it another way: Guthrie\u2019s \ntheory seems unable to explain why, despite missionary critiques of \u2018praying to wood and \n 12\nstone\u2019, a Manggarai villager might continue to insist that the land can hear and does have \nan appetite (see Allerton, this issue). \n \nBy contrast with Guthrie\u2019s approach, I would like to suggest that we take more seriously \nthe (implicit or explicit) claims of our informants that the landscape has agency. To do \nso, one does not have to \u2018believe\u2019 that rocks can smell or that glaciers can listen. Instead, \none needs to be alert to the ways in which places, as particular kinds of things, have \u2018real \nmaterial and ideological effects on persons and social relations\u2019 (Tilley 2004, 222). This \nkind of position\u2014that agency may have multiple locations beyond \u2018biologically discrete \nindividuals\u2019 (Keane 1997, 7)\u2014is emerging from an eclectic body of work on science, art \nobjects and materiality (Latour 1993; Gell 1998; Tilley 2004; Miller 2005). Since a more \nthorough consideration of this work is beyond the scope of this Introduction, there are \ntwo aspects that I want to point to as suggestive. Firstly, contrary to the criticism that the \nterm implies some kind of \u2018magical mind-dust\u2019 (Ingold 2007, 11), \u2018agency\u2019 refers not to \nwill or intention but simply to \u2018doing\u2019 (Giddens 1984, 10), to exerting power or \nproducing an effect. Moreover, agency might sometimes be distributed across \u2018networks\u2019, \nthe \u2018mixes of artefact and idea and person which make up life\u2019 (Strathern 1999, 120), and \nof which landscapes\u2014as I utilise the term in this Introduction\u2014are clearly one form. \nLatour (2000) gives the example of the \u2018Berliner key\u2019, a particular kind of key that \nobliges a resident to lock the door behind them when entering a building, thus enforcing \ntight social controls on entry and exit. He argues that the Berliner key is not a mere \nreflection of a social ideal, but actively develops and shapes such ideals. Similarly, Carl \nKnappett argues that speed bumps or \u2018sleeping policemen\u2019 (the term is apt) are \u2018agents\/ \nobjects designed to force drivers to conform to a moral code\u2019 (2002, 99). For Knappett, \nthese examples demonstrate that agency is \u2018widely distributed\u2019 across an environment, \nand inheres in \u2018the relationships between the various entities that constitute a field of \naction\u2019 (2002, 100). \n \nThe second point to highlight is the way in which the new materiality studies emphasise \nthat people can not \u2018think about or react to the material world in pretty much any way \nthey like\u2019 (Tilley 2007, 19). This is particularly relevant to a consideration of landscapes \n 13\nsince, following Gibson (1979), a number of authors have stressed that humans perceive \nthe environment in terms of what it offers, in terms of its \u2018affordances\u2019 (Ingold 1992, 42-\n44; Bird-David 1999, 74). As Telle\u2019s paper in this issue makes clear, a place such as a \nlarge and old tree can not carry any possible meaning, but affords people certain kinds of \npractices and ideas. Similarly, it seems to be no coincidence that mountains are so often \nconceptualised as sources of spiritual potency, or as sites for new religious identities (see \nHowell and Amster, this issue). Indeed, Tilley argues that we may translate the term \n\u2018agency\u2019 as meaning \u2018providing affordances and constraints for thought and action\u2019 \n(2007, 19). \n \nHaving suggested that we may wish to approach places and landscapes as agents, I want \nto return to issues of (ongoing) religious conversion. Questions of agency are not simply \nmatters for academic debate. In encounters with Christian missionaries or Islamic \nmodernizers, as well as in their increased personal adherence to world religions, people \noften experience a radical clash between different understandings of the location of \nagency. Webb Keane\u2019s recent work (2007) on semiotics and materiality sheds light on the \nprocesses behind, and the reasons for, such clashes of understanding. Keane is concerned \nwith the ways in which the question \u2018What beings have agency?\u2019 drove the troubled \nclassification of words, things and subjects in the encounter between missionaries and \nfollowers of ancestral ritual on Sumba. He outlines the concept of \u2018semiotic ideology\u2019 as \na means of elucidating historically-specific, morally-loaded projects of \u2018purification\u2019 that \ninvolve sorting out the \u2018proper relations among, and boundaries between, words, things, \nand subjects\u2019 (Keane 2007, 4). The term \u2018purification\u2019 is borrowed from Latour, for \nwhom it references the constant (and for Latour deluded) efforts of \u2018moderns\u2019 to separate \nout humans from non-humans, even as \u2018hybrids of nature and culture\u2019 proliferate all \naround (1993, 10). Whilst noting the \u2018puzzles\u2019 and over-generalisations of Latour\u2019s \ntheory, Keane nevertheless draws from it the important question of why people may be \nled to purify (Keane 2007, 7). Keane shows how the mission encounter on Sumba \ninvolved a historical clash between the semiotic ideology of Dutch Calvinism, which saw \nspeech and materially as utterly distinct, and that of ancestral ritualists, for whom words \nand things were not so radically discrete. In this issue, the tension between various \n 14\nprojects of landscape \u2018purification\u2019, and more holistic understandings of the multiple \nnetworks and locations of agency, is an important theme of all the papers. \n \nHowever, whilst concerns to \u2018purify\u2019 place may be seen as much in Muslim as in \nProtestant contexts, the clash of semiotic ideologies that Keane outlines is by no means \ninevitable in the context of ongoing religious conversion. If, like Austin-Broos, we see \nconversion as \u2018continuing and practiced\u2019 (2003, 9), constituted not by a singular \nexperience but by a passage through social experience, then we can acknowledge that \nconversion may slowly and gradually involve new forms of relatedness with the \nenvironment. Ongoing conversion may lead not to purification, but to the creation of \nsyncretic landscapes (see Bovensiepen, this issue), or to a refusal of religious synthesis \nand an explicit attempt to maintain the boundaries between religion and local places \n(Allerton, this issue). However, it is also possible that conversion may not lead to heated \nexchanges on the existence of spirit-places; rather, and possibly more damningly, \nconversion may involve spirits being \u2018merely ignored\u2019 (Lohmann 2003b 109; cf. Amster, \nthis issue). This suggests that the passage of conversion may lead to what Weiner terms \n\u2018topothanatia\u2019, the \u2018death, withdrawal, effacement or covering over of places\u2019 (2001, \n234). \n \nSpiritual Landscapes and their Transformations \n \nIt is clear that despite the many social, economic, political and ecological changes in \nSoutheast Asia over recent decades, landscape and place remain imbued with \nconsiderable potency. Let us consider three striking, recent examples. Firstly, \nAbdurrahman Wahid, Indonesia\u2019s first democratically elected President, was frequently \nto be found praying at the tombs of Javanese Islamic leaders, before returning to Jakarta \nfull of renewed political resolve (Chambert-Loir and Reid 2002, xv). Secondly, around \nthe notorious Freeport mine in West Papua, the Amungme people continue to assert their \nprimordial link with the landscape through their knowledge of its names, despite the \nlandscape\u2019s destruction and the violence symbolised by army graffiti on rocks (Ballard \n2002). Finally, during the 2002 construction of the KL (Kuala Lumpur) Monorail, a \n 15\nunexplained accident in which a wheel fell onto a journalist\u2019s head was widely \ninterpreted as caused by a local ghost or god associated with a Hindu temple (Baxstrom \n2008, 194-7). In very different ways, the violently-dispossessed Amungme, the urban \nresidents of a Southeast Asian metropolis, and President Wahid all acknowledge the \nunseen power of the landscape. \n \nIn this volume, we are particularly interested in the influence of new religious forms and \npractices on different spiritual landscapes. Previous ethnographic work, whilst it does not \nexplicitly address the issue of landscape formation, is nevertheless suggestive of the \ninfluence of the world religions on conceptions of spirits and spirit-places. Cannell, for \nexample, describes how Catholicism heightened the ambivalence people in Bicol felt \ntowards the tawo spirits, but argues that this ambivalence actually predated the Spanish \ninvasion of the lowland Philippines (1999, 126-7). Her ethnography provides nuanced \nevidence of how Catholic Bicolanos try to work out the \u2018relative legitimacy\u2019 (Cannell \n1999, 229) of dealings with the unseen spirit realm. Aragon has described what could be \ncalled a form of purification policing among the Tobaku of Sulawesi, where Salvation \nArmy officers attempt to be present at all community ceremonies, including agricultural \nrituals in fields, in order to ensure that \u2018ritual protocols meet church specifications\u2019 \n(2000, 236). Bowen\u2019s work on Gayo ritual shows the range of attitudes towards spirits \nthat may be held within one Muslim community. He describes how a category of \npowerful spirits known as auli\u00eb are seen by the \u2018modernist-leaning minority\u2019 as \nexemplary, saintly beings, but by other villagers as \u2018mediators between humans and the \nenvironment\u2019 (Bowen 1993, 198-9). \n \nOf course, pre-conversion understandings of spiritual landscapes were never static, and \nwe must beware of portraying them as such in our analyses. Steedly\u2019s account of Karo \nspirits is particularly sensitive to this issue, arguing against the \u2018erasure of social-political \ncontext\u2019, in which historical accounts of spirits are detached from the surrounding social \nexperience of, in the Karo case, banditry, colonialism and missionisation (1993, 131). \nSimilarly, whilst acknowledging the impact of religious change on spiritual landscapes, \nthe papers in this issue also pay attention to significant political, economic and social \n 16\nfactors. One such factor is migration, which Amster shows has profoundly shaped, in \nspecifically gendered ways, Kelabit experiences of the landscape. In Bovensiepen\u2019s \npaper, she stresses the significance of the resettlement of Funar villagers during the \nIndonesian occupation of East Timor. Since 1999, these villagers have been returning to \nFunar, but they experience considerable anxiety that their previous enforced absence has \ndisturbed reciprocal relations with the landscape. In my paper on the Manggarai of \nFlores, I also outline the challenges posed by a more peaceful, state-sponsored \nresettlement, and the ways in which new ritual forms engage with the spiritual aspects of \na \u2018developed\u2019 landscape.  \n \nAt the beginning of this Introduction, drawing on Ingold\u2019s (2000) work, I stressed that \nthose who inhabit a landscape do not confront it as a setting or container \u2018out there\u2019, but \ndiscover its meaning through practical activity and movements. I also emphasised that an \nunderstanding of the landscape as a lived world needed to be separated from a \nperspective on landscape as a \u2018way of seeing\u2019. However, both Amster\u2019s account of \nKelabit migration and Howell\u2019s focus on town-dwelling members of a \u2018mountain \nchurch\u2019, alert us to the possibility that, as people move to urban centres, they may begin \nto adopt a more detached perspective on the rural landscapes with which they no longer \ndaily engage. As a landscape becomes a kind of \u2018homeland\u2019 to which people \nintermittently return, so it becomes more possible for it to serve as a representation of an \nethnic or other identity. By contrast, the papers by Allerton, Bovensiepen and Telle all \ndeal with rural communities who cannot adopt such an exterior perspective, since their \nlandscapes are the environments in which they continue to fetch water, build their homes, \nplant their crops and bury their dead. This alerts us not only to the links between \nenvironmental perception and ways of making a living, but also suggests the different \nspatial and temporal scales on which people\u2019s landscapes operate (Bender 1993, 2). \n \nAs mentioned, a key theme of this issue is the extent to which world religions necessitate \na \u2018purification\u2019 of the landscape, a separation of what may be seen as properly-human \nagency from material places. In Howell\u2019s paper on the Protestant \u2018mountain churches\u2019 of \nnorthern Luzon, the project of purification seems to have been entirely successful, since \n 17\nagency has been \u2018firmly differentiated\u2019 from the materiality of the environment. \nSimilarly, Amster argues that Kelabit conversion to Christianity has helped to \u2018unhinge\u2019 \nspiritual concerns from a landscape previously teeming with spirits and other entities. By \ncontrast, in both Bovensiepen\u2019s paper on East Timor, and Allerton\u2019s paper on the \nManggarai, notions of spirits and energies remain embedded in the landscape, in large \npart because they have not been explicitly targeted by Catholic priests, who assign such \nnotions to a non-religious category of \u2018culture\u2019 or \u2018custom\u2019. However, there are still \nimportant differences between these two Catholic examples. Whilst, in Funar, the Church \n(particularly in the form of the Virgin Mary) is conceptualised as a similar kind of force \nto the potency of the land, in Manggarai a stricter separation is drawn between what \nconcerns \u2018custom\u2019 and what concerns \u2018religion\u2019. Here, crosses are merely signs of \nblessing and protection, but cannot contribute to the potent energy of the land. At first \nsight, Telle\u2019s account of Islamic attitudes towards the Sasak landscape suggests a project \nof purification as successful as those in the Protestant cases described by Howell and \nAmster. However, Telle argues that whilst the Sasak may have abandoned older ritual \npractices, they have not abandoned the conception of an animated, sentient landscape, \nand still pay much attention to its \u2018signs\u2019. \n \nDespite the successful removal of spirit notions and essences from the landscape, in both \nthe mountain churches of northern Luzon, and among the Kelabit, we see an intriguing \nattempt at \u2018re-enchantment\u2019 of a now Christian landscape. Thus, Howell describes how \nthe mountain landscape of northern Luzon has been \u2018re-imagined\u2019 in Christian terms. The \nmountains are no longer seen as having agency, but they do have spiritual significance as \nan ethnic homeland and as a \u2018gift from God\u2019. Similarly, Amster argues that Kelabit \nconversion has led to a \u2018resacralization\u2019 of local place, particularly in the transformation \nof Mount Murud from a place of primordial spirits to a multi-ethnic pilgrimage site. In \nboth of these cases, \u2018re-enchantment\u2019 seems to take place partly through a conscious \napproach to the landscape as an object, whether of ethnic attachment or a gift. Perhaps \nthe most extreme example of such objectification is Telle\u2019s description of a prayer house \nconstructed from the timber of a fallen graveyard tree, a \u2018sentient\u2019, living aspect of the \nlandscape transformed into a merit-making object. However, Telle\u2019s example, with its \n 18\nstress on the continuity of perceptions of the landscape despite ritual shifts, suggests that \nin this case there are still limits to a fully \u2018Muslim landscape\u2019. \n \nFinally, a further common theme explored by the papers is the relative weight given to \nthe positive or beneficial versus the negative or harmful aspects of the landscape. \nBovensiepen describes how, following the end of the Indonesian occupation, the people \nof Funar returned to their village. In doing so, they stressed the health, wealth and well-\nbeing to be gained by living on ancestral land. However, Bovensiepen notes that they also \nsay that lulik, or the energy of the land, is dangerous, especially outside of inhabited \nsettlements, and in doing so translate such negative spiritual aspects as \u2018devils\u2019. Amster \nstresses how, prior to conversion, Kelabit had to continually read the signs and omens of \nthe landscape, attributed danger to key sites, and were prohibited from visiting others. In \nmany respects, giving up this attitude to the landscape in the course of conversion has \nallowed Kelabit individuals to move freely both within and beyond their surrounding \nenvironment. Whilst Amster stresses the \u2018portable potency\u2019 that Christianity affords, \nAllerton\u2019s paper outlines shifting perceptions of the mobility of ancestral spirits, who are \nbeing called from the highlands to ensure the fertility of a lowland, state-funded wet-rice \nproject. However, in the Manggarai context, a contrast is also drawn between the \nbeneficial and harmful aspects of the landscape, and Catholic symbols and objects are \nincreasingly utilised to protect against the latter. \n \nAs Southeast Asia\u2019s population continues to migrate to work elsewhere in or beyond the \nregion, as people continue to move from rural to urban areas, and as the environment is \nincreasingly utilised for mining projects or the planting of palm-oil plantations, people\u2019s \nspiritual entanglements with the landscape will continue to change and develop. \nConnections to the land, to its mountains, trees and rivers, can be used as a focus for \nexploring people\u2019s sense of continuity and discontinuity in the face of change. In the \npapers that follow, we see evidence, both historical and contemporary, of the distinctive \nSoutheast Asian spiritual landscapes I outlined at the beginning of this Introduction. \nHowever, we also see evidence, both radical and subtle, of shifts in understandings of \nthose landscapes, and of growing contestation over their meaning. \n 19\n \nReferences \n \nAlejo, A. 2000.

Mary Steedly was our \ndiscussant at the panel, and I would like to acknowledge the influence of her perceptive \ncomments on this introduction. I am grateful to Gill Hutcherson for her editorial work on \nthis issue, and to three anonymous reviewers for Anthropological Forum for their \ncomments on a previous version of this Introduction. I would particularly like to thank \nthe overall special edition reviewer, who will no doubt dispute my argument here, but \nwhose criticisms have helped clarify my position. \n2 Since 1995, the Ifugao rice terraces have been on UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage List as a \nprotected \u2018cultural landscape\u2019. For more on how Ifugao Christian converts negotiate \nbetween their new religion and their ancestral rice rituals, see Ammayao (2003, 456). \n3 There is, of course, a rich and continuing tradition of work exploring the entanglements \nof kinship, morality and the ancestral landscape amongst Australian Aborigines, but for \nreasons of space and regional focus I am unable to consider it in any more detail here. \nSee, in particular, Povinelli (1995), Munn (1996) and Merlan (1998). \n4 Michael Lambek has stressed how the \u2018pragmatic dimension\u2019 is always relevant to ideas \nabout spirits: people are less likely to ask \u2018Which of these spirits exist?\u2019 than \u2018Which of \nthem has power to influence my life now?\u2019 (1996, 247). Interestingly, Benjamin argued \n 26\n                                                                                                                                                 \nthat Islam did not \u2018oust the spirit-cults\u2019 in Malaysia in part because it did not explain \u2018the \nordinary peasant\u2019s experience of daily suffering\u2019 (1979, 24). \n5 For the purposes of meaningful comparison across only a few case-studies, the papers in \nthis issue focus on the peoples of island Southeast Asia. However, there are clearly many \ncomparisons to be drawn with spiritual landscapes and their transformations in mainland \nSoutheast Asia, where notions of spirits are also intrinsically connected to place (see, for \nexample, Spiro 1967; Tambiah 1970; Askew 2003; Tannenbaum and Kammerer 2003). \n6 By contrast with such an assumption, Knappett draws on alternative cognitive \nperspectives which stress that \u2018the mind is embodied, and that the mind is extended\u2019 \n(2002, 98). \n"}
