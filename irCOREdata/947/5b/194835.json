Within a central region of radius 10 arcmin (21 kpc),\nthe X-ray emission broadly traces the pattern of the spiral arms, establishing a strong link\nwith recent star formation, but it also exhibits a radial scalelength of \u22482.6 arcmin (5.4 kpc)\nconsistent with optical data.

We find a two-temperature thermal model best fits the spectral\ndata with derived temperatures of 0.20+0.01\u22120.01 and 0.68+0.06\u22120.04 keV which are very typical of the\ndiffuse components seen in other normal and starburst galaxies.

We interpret these results in\nterms of a clumpy thin-disc component which traces the spiral arms of M101 plus an extended\nlower halo component with large filling factor.\nKey words: galaxies: individual: M101 \u2013 galaxies: spiral \u2013 X-rays: galaxies \u2013 X-rays: ISM.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nThe hot (T \u223c 106 K), X-ray emitting plasma observed in the disc of\nour Galaxy is an important factor when considering the energy bal-\nance and enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM). Energized\nby the winds of young massive stars and supernovae, its properties\nrelate to the supernova rate, the evolution of supernova remnants\n(SNRs) and the impact of young star clusters on their environment.\nIn normal spiral galaxies like the Milky Way, hot gas produced by\nmultiple supernova explosions may escape from the disc via galactic\nfountains and\/or chimneys (Shapiro & Field 1976; Bregman 1980;\nNorman & Ikeuchi 1989) resulting in a dynamic corona that is bound\nto the galaxy. This gas then cools, condenses and falls back to the\ndisc, possibly as high-velocity clouds (Bregman 1980). In contrast,\nthe extremely high star formation rates in starburst galaxies give\nrise to hotter (T \u0001 107 K) large-scale metal-rich outflows from the\nstarburst regions in the form of \u2018superwinds\u2019 (e.g. Heckman, Ar-\nmus & Miley 1990). Such superwinds are energetic enough to fully\nescape the influence of the galaxy and are potentially important for\nthe enrichment and heating of the intergalactic medium (e.g. Martin,\nKobulnicky & Heckman 2003).\n\u0002E-mail: rsw@star.le.ac.uk\nUnfortunately, the opacity of the Galactic plane to soft X-rays\ngreatly complicates the study of the extent, physical properties and\nfilling factor of the X-ray emitting plasma in our own Galaxy.\nHowever, observations of nearby spiral galaxies with configura-\ntions ranging from face-on to edge-on can circumvent many of the\nproblems inherent in studies of the Milky Way. The Einstein obser-\nvatory provided the first detection of ultrahot outflows from the discs\nof edge-on starburst galaxies (Watson, Stanger & Griffiths 1984),\nalthough only upper limits were obtained on the diffuse emission\nproduced in the discs of normal spiral galaxies (Bregman & Glass-\ngold 1982; McCammon & Sanders 1984). The improved through-\nput and spatial resolution of subsequent ROSAT Position Sensitive\nProportional Counter (PSPC)\/High Resolution Imager (HRI) ob-\nservations revealed unambiguous evidence for truly diffuse emis-\nsion in spiral galaxies (Cui et al. 1996; Read, Ponman & Strick-\nland 1997). More recently, diffuse structures have been observed\nwith the XMM\u2013Newton and Chandra observatories in samples of\nboth edge-on (Pietsch et al. 2001; Stevens, Read & Bravo-Guerrero\n2003; Strickland et al. 2004a,b) and face-on spiral galaxies (Kuntz\net al. 2003; Tyler et al. 2004). In the face-on systems, diffuse X-\nrays were found to correlate with the nuclear regions, trace recent\nstar formation within the spiral arms and correlate spatially with\nH\u03b1 and mid-infrared emission (Tyler et al. 2004). In the survey of\nedge-on systems by Strickland et al. (2004a,b), extraplanar diffuse\nemission was detected in all starburst galaxies and one normal spiral\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors.

A diffuse X-ray component\nwas first hinted at in the central regions of M101 with Einstein at\nenergies in the range 0.2\u20131.5 keV (McCammon & Sanders 1984;\nTrinchieri, Fabbiano & Romaine 1990). Subsequent ROSAT PSPC\nobservations (Snowden & Pietsch 1995) revealed extensive diffuse\nX-ray emission in the 0.1\u20131 keV band, corresponding to thermal\nemission in the temperature range 1\u20133 \u00d7 106 K. The dominant soft\ncomponent was spatially peaked towards the centre of the galaxy\nbut could also be traced out to a radius of at least 7 arcmin (15 kpc\nat a distance of 7.2 Mpc). It was argued that this soft emission could\nnot originate solely in the disc as this would require a filling factor\ngreater than unity. After correcting for absorption intrinsic to M101,\nthe total diffuse luminosity was estimated to be at least 1040 erg s\u22121.\nIn the ROSAT HRI study of Wang, Immler & Pietsch (1999), low\nsurface-brightness X-ray emission was detected both in the central\nregion of M101 and in the vicinity of bright H II regions in the spiral\narms of the galaxy. The improved spatial resolution of the HRI (\u223c5\narcsec) allowed the detection and subtraction of point sources down\nto a luminosity of 4 \u00d7 1037 erg s\u22121, after which the total 0.5\u20132 keV\nluminosity of the residual emission within a radius of 12 arcmin\nwas estimated to be 9 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121. These authors agreed with\nSnowden & Pietsch (1995) that faint discrete X-ray sources were\nlikely to account for only a fraction of the observed flux, implying\nthat the bulk of the soft emission is truly diffuse in nature. The\nX-ray spectra of the emission in the central region from both the\nROSAT PSPC and ASCA GIS were fitted simultaneously, yielding\na soft thermal component with a temperature of kT \u223c 0.2 keV,\nplus a hard power-law continuum most plausibly explained as the\nintegrated emission of the population of hard X-ray binary sources\n(XRBs) in M101.\nFurther progress was made in the Chandra study of Kuntz et al.\n(2003), using data from the 8 arcmin2 ACIS-S3 chip from the first\n\u223c100 ks Chandra observation of M101. The superb spatial reso-\nlution of Chandra allowed the removal of point sources down to\nluminosities of \u223c1036 erg s\u22121, leaving residual emission of lumi-\nnosity 2.3 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 in the 0.45\u20131.0 keV band, 16 per cent of\nwhich was estimated to come from unresolved XRBs and dwarf\nstars. The bulk of the soft emission was found to trace the spiral\narms and was also spatially correlated with H\u03b1 and far-ultraviolet\n(FUV) emission, physically linking the soft X-ray emission to re-\ngions of on-going star formation. The X-ray spectrum of the diffuse\nemission was well described by a two-temperature thermal plasma\nwith kT = 0.2\/0.75 keV, with a large covering factor implying that\na significant fraction of the softest component originates in the halo\nof M101.\nThis is the third in a series of papers reporting the results of XMM\u2013\nNewton observations of M101. In Jenkins et al. (2004a) (hereafter\nPaper I), the spectral and timing properties of the brightest X-ray\nsources were investigated, whereas in Jenkins et al. (2005b) (here-\nafter Paper II) we reported on the full catalogue of X-ray sources\ndetected in M101 by XMM\u2013Newton. In the current paper, we focus\non the morphology and spectral properties of the \u2018diffuse\u2019 X-ray\ncomponent in this galaxy. The structure of this paper is as follows.\nFirst, we describe the XMM\u2013Newton observations and the methods\nused to construct images and spectra of the residual emission af-\nter the exclusion of bright discrete sources (Section 2). Next, we\ninvestigate the likely composition, spectral properties and spatial\nmorphology of this residual emission (Section 3). We then go on to\ndiscuss the implications of our results (Section 4) and, finally, pro-\nvide a brief summary of our conclusions (Section 5). Throughout\nthis paper, we assume a distance to M101 of 7.2 Mpc (Stetson et al.\n1998), implying that an angular scale of 1 arcmin corresponds to a\nlinear extent of 2.09 kpc in M101.\n2 O B S E RVAT I O N S A N D DATA R E D U C T I O N\nThree XMM\u2013Newton EPIC observations have been made of M101\nas summarized in Table 1. Our earlier analysis of the point source\npopulation in M101, presented in Papers I and II of this series, uti-\nlized only the first observation performed in 2002. However, for this\npaper, we have taken advantage of two additional observations car-\nried out by XMM\u2013Newton in 2004\/2005 as a Target of Opportunity\n(TOO) programme to follow up the outburst of the ultraluminous\nsupersoft X-ray source J140332.3+542103 (see Kong, Di Stefano &\nYuan 2004; Mukai et al. 2005). The first XMM\u2013Newton observation\nwas targeted at the nucleus of the galaxy with the result that the 30 ar-\ncmin diameter field-of-view of the EPIC cameras encompassed the\nfull 28.8 arcmin (D25) extent of M101 (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991).\nIn the second and third observations, the source J140332.3+542103\nwas placed on axis, resulting in a 3.3 arcmin eastward offset of the\nfield-of-view with respect to the first observation.\nAll data sets were screened for periods of high background by\naccumulating full field 10\u201315 keV light curves. MOS data were\nexcluded during periods when the 10\u201315 keV count rate exceeded\n0.3 ct s\u22121, and the pn data were similarly screened when the pn\ncount rate exceeded 3 ct s\u22121 (except in Observation 1, which was\nmore heavily contaminated by flaring, where the pn threshold was\nset at 0.9 ct s\u22121). For the subsequent image and spectral analysis,\nsingle- and double-pixel events were selected for the pn (Pattern 0\u2013\n4), whereas single to quadruple events (Pattern 0\u201312) were utilized\nin the case of the MOS data.\n2.1 Image processing and point source subtraction\nTo study the morphology of the diffuse component, pn and MOS\nimages and associated exposure maps were created for each obser-\nvation in three energy bands: soft (0.3\u20131 keV), medium (1\u20132 keV)\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors.

In all\nfour panels, the two large circles have radii of 5 and 10 arcmin.\nand hard (2\u20136 keV). In each case, the pixel size was set at 4.35 \u00d7 4.35\narcsec2. The pn, MOS 1 and MOS 2 images in each of the three bands\nwere first flat-fielded by subtracting a constant (non-vignetted) back-\nground particle rate (estimated from the count rates recorded in the\ncorners of the CCD detectors not exposed to the sky) and then di-\nviding by the appropriate exposure map. In the same process, bad\npixels, hot columns and spurious data along chip gaps were excised.\nThe resulting data from the three observations were then mosaicked\ninto flat-fielded pn and MOS (MOS 1 plus MOS 2) images for each\nband. Since the medium- and hard-band images showed no evidence\nfor diffuse emission, here we focus primarily on the images obtained\nin the soft (0.3\u20131 keV) band. Fig. 1(a) shows an adaptively smoothed\nsoft-band image, obtained from the combined pn and MOS data sets,\nencompassing the central 20 arcmin diameter region centred on the\noptical nucleus of M101 (RA 14h3m12.s55, Dec. +54\u25e620\u203256.\u2032\u20325). The\namplitude scaling is logarithmic and adjusted so as to highlight the\nextended low surface brightness emission in M101.\nTo facilitate the investigation of the contribution of bright sources\nto the total X-ray emission in M101, a master source list, applica-\nble to the three observations, was created. To this end, each of the\nnew observations was analysed in turn using the source detection\nprocedure described in Paper II (applied to the soft-, medium- and\nhard-band data). Then, by comparing the resulting source lists, the\n108 sources detected in Observation 1 (Paper II) were supplemented\nby 21 new sources from Observation 2 and an additional nine new\nsources from Observation 3, to give a combined source catalogue\nof 138 sources (see the Appendix for details of the new sources).\nThe next step involved the construction of a spatial mask for the\nsuppression of the bright X-ray sources in the central field of M101.\nUsing the pn+MOS flat-fielded soft-band image, a soft-band source\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors.

Warwick et al.\ncount rate, net of the local background (LBG), was determined at\neach source position; in practice, we extracted the count rate within a\ncell of 16 arcsec radius centred on the source position, subtracted the\nLBG and lastly applied a correction for the extent of the point spread\nfunction (PSF) beyond the source cell. We then selected the sources\nwithin 11 arcmin radius of the nucleus of M101 with count rates\nabove 1.5 pn+MOS ct ks\u22121 as a \u2018bright source sample\u2019 to be excised\nfrom the soft-band image. Here, our approach was to construct a\nmodel image in which each source in our bright source list was\nrepresented by a PSF subimage centred on the source position and\nan intensity scaling commensurate with the measured source count\nrate. Then, by applying a cut at a surface brightness threshold of\n0.01 pn+MOS ct ks\u22121 pixel\u22121, we were able to construct a bright\nsource mask (see Fig. 1b). A total of 65 bright soft-band sources\nwere removed within a radius of 11 arcmin of the nucleus of M101\n(25 sources within 5 arcmin).\nFig. 1(c) shows the pn+MOS soft-band image of M101 after\napplying the bright source mask with the colour table adjusted to\nhighlight the distribution of the residual emission.1\nThe residual component is most prominent within the central 5\narcmin radius region, although it can be traced out to 10 arcmin\nin the radial profile distribution shown in Fig. 2. There is a clear\ncorrelation with the spiral structure of the galaxy, as is evident from a\ncomparison with the GALEX near-UV (NUV; 2310 \u00c5) band image of\nM101 (Bianchi et al. 2005; Popescu et al. 2005) shown in Fig. 1(d).\n2.2 Spectral extraction of the diffuse component\nThe images in Fig. 1 demonstrate the existence of an extensive\nresidual component in the soft X-ray emission of M101. In order\nto investigate the spectral properties of this component, we have\nextracted spectral data for the 5 arcmin radius region, centred on the\nposition of the nucleus. A total of nine individual diffuse emission\nspectra were derived from the appropriate event files (for the three\nEPIC instruments, over the three observations). In each case, regions\naround bright point sources were excluded using the mask described\nearlier. (In practice, this involved the use of circular exclusion cells\nof radius 12\u201353 arcsec, as an approximation to the source mask used\nin the image analysis.).\nGiven the extended nature of the diffuse emission, the background\nsubtraction is more complicated than is usual with EPIC data. The\nuse of other XMM\u2013Newton data sets deriving from \u2018blank-field\u2019 ob-\nservations is, in our view, not a good option due to the variation from\nfield to field in the soft X-ray background from the sky \u2013 clearly an\nimportant consideration when attempting to measure a soft diffuse\nsignal. Instead LBG spectra were extracted from each event file for\nthe annular region from 5 to 10 arcmin radius (see Fig. 1a) \u2013 again\nwith the regions around bright sources excluded. We also extracted\nparticle background (PBG) spectra from the out-of-field-of-view\ncorner regions in each EPIC camera. The true background beneath\nthe residual M101 emission in the central source region will be made\nup primarily of (vignetted) photons from the X-ray sky and (non-\nvignetted) particles, which comprise the instrumental background.\nThe LBG spectra will also have photon and particle components,\n1 Hereafter, in this paper we use the word \u2018residual\u2019 to describe the X-ray\nemission of M101 after masking out the bright discrete X-ray sources. This\nresidual component will include the truly diffuse emission, the integrated\nemission of discrete sources with count rates below our source-exclusion\nthreshold and also some low-level contamination from bright sources due to\nthe spillover beyond the masked regions of their extended PSFs (see Fig. 1b).\nFigure 2.

The solid line\nshows an exponential fall-off in the surface brightness with a scalelength of\n2.6 arcmin (5.4 kpc), as determined from optical B data (Okamura, Kanazawa\n& Kodaira 1976).\nbut, as the LBG region is further off-axis than the source region,\nthese components are not in the correct ratio for accurate back-\nground subtraction (since the signal reduction due to the vignetting\nis larger in the LBG region). However, a very good model of the\ntrue background can be made from a combination of the LBG and\nPBG spectra, provided the contributions of the two are appropriately\nscaled2 to allow for the vignetting-corrected and actual areas of the\ncentral, LBG and PBG extraction regions. Using this approach, an\nappropriate composite background was determined for each cen-\ntral region spectrum together with the corresponding Redistribution\nMatrix File (RMF) and Auxiliary Response File (ARF) files. Finally\nfor each data set, the spectral channels were binned together to give\na minimum of 20 counts per bin.\nGiven the radial profile in Fig. 2, the above amounts to a differen-\ntial measurement of the galaxy spectrum, which in effect compares\nthe integrated signal in the central 5 arcmin region with the equiva-\nlent signal measured in the 5\u201310 arcmin annular region.\n3 R E S U LT S\n3.1 Luminosity and composition of the residual emission\nAfter the exclusion of the bright source regions and subtracting the\nmean sky surface brightness measured in the 5\u201310 arcmin annulus,\nthe count rate in the central 5 arcmin region is 0.28 pn+MOS ct s\u22121\n(0.3\u20131 keV). However, we need to apply three correction factors\nto obtain the \u2018true\u2019 central 5 arcmin count rate. The first accounts\nfor the loss of \u2018diffuse\u2019 signal due to the source mask which blocks\n12 per cent of the central area. The second factor allows for the\ndifferential nature of the measurement (i.e. the fact that we extract\nthe background from the 5\u201310 arcmin annulus where the galaxy\nis still bright); on the basis of the radial profile determined ear-\nlier, we estimate that this effect suppresses the central count rate by\n2 The scale factors applied to the LBG and PBG spectra were, respectively,\n(Ac\/ALBG) \u00d7 (Vc\/VLBG) and (Ac\/APBG) \u00d7 (1 \u2212 Vc\/VLBG).

Finally, the spillage of the bright source signal be-\nyond the masked region (due to the extended PSF) contributes about\n9 per cent of the measured residual count rate [as determined from\nthe source model image shown in Fig. 1(b)]. The correction of all the\nthree effects translates to a 28 per cent upward scaling of the resid-\nual count rate. If we adopt the best-fitting two-temperature model\ndescribed in Section 3.2, the count rate to flux conversion factor\nis 1 pn+MOS ct s\u22121 = 0.97 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 for the 0.5\u20132.0\nkeV band (fluxes corrected for Galactic absorption). The equivalent\nfactors for the 0.3\u20131 and 0.45\u20131 keV bands are 1.16 and 0.91 \u00d7\n10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (ct s\u22121)\u22121, respectively.\nThe implied luminosity of the central emission of M101 after ex-\ncluding bright sources is 2.1 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 in the 0.5\u20132 keV band.\nHowever, we must take into account the fact that our source ex-\nclusion threshold is relatively high [roughly a factor of 10 higher\nthan that employed in the equivalent Chandra study (Kuntz et al.\n2003)]. Chandra has shown that the log N \u2212 log S relation for rel-\natively faint sources in the central region of M101 (after correction\nfor background AGNs) is quite flat with a slope of \u22120.80 \u00b1 0.05 in\nthe integral counts (Pence et al. 2001), implying that bright sources\nprovide the dominant contribution to the discrete source luminosity\nof the galaxy. Using the count rate to flux conversion factor quoted\nearlier, our source exclusion threshold of 1.5 pn+MOS ct ks\u22121 (0.3\u2013\n1 keV) corresponds to a source luminosity of 9 \u00d7 1036 erg s\u22121 (0.5\u20132\nkeV), although this could be an underestimate for the harder spec-\ntral forms more typical of bright X-ray binaries. In fact, a source\nexclusion threshold of 1 \u00d7 1037 erg s\u22121 appears to be a reasonable es-\ntimate based on the average count rate to flux conversion obtained\nwhen we compare our measurements with those quoted in Pence\net al. (2001) for the subset of common sources. As a check, at the\nlatter luminosity threshold the Chandra source counts predict \u224825\nsources within a central 5 arcmin region, which is very consistent\nwith the number of sources actually excluded in our study. Using\nthe Chandra source counts, we find the integrated luminosity in\ndiscrete sources from our exclusion cut-off down to a factor of 10\ndeeper (in effect the Chandra limit) amounts to about 20 per cent\nof the residual signal measured by XMM\u2013Newton. In other words,\nour estimate of the \u2018diffuse\u2019 luminosity of M101 (after allowing for\nthe contribution of sources brighter than \u223c 1036 erg s\u22121) is 1.7 \u00d7\n1039 erg s\u22121 (0.5\u20132 keV) in good agreement with the value reported\nby Kuntz et al. (2003) based on Chandra measurements of the same\nregion.\n3.2 Spectral properties of the residual emission\nThe nine epic spectra were fitted simultaneously using a variety of\nspectral models, with identical model parameters applied to each of\nthe data sets. Visual inspection of the spectra indicated almost no\nemission above \u22481.5 keV. No acceptable fit could be obtained using\njust a single hot plasma component. However, a good fit (reduced\n\u03c7 2 = 0.87 for 2986 degrees of freedom) was obtained with a model\nincorporating two thermal (solar abundance) Mekal components,\nwith absorption attributable to the hydrogen column density of our\nGalaxy in the direction of M101 (1.16 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122; Dickey &\nLockman 1990). The derived temperatures for the two components\nwere 0.20+0.01\u22120.01 and 0.68+0.06\u22120.04 keV (90 per cent confidence limits\nassuming one interesting parameter). The data plus best-fitting two-\ntemperature model are shown in Fig. 3. (In this figure, we show\nthe averages of the three pn and the six MOS spectra for clarity\nof display; however, the spectral-fitting results quoted here pertain\nto the fits to the nine individual spectra.)

When we allowed the metallicity of the two plasmas to vary\nfrom unity (i.e. solar values), we obtained a best fit of 0.044 (0.038\u2013\n0.055) solar for the lower temperature component and 0.17 (0.10\u2013\n0.50) solar for the hotter component (with a reduced \u03c7 2 for the fit of\n0.81). However, this determination of strongly subsolar abundances\nis most probably an artefact of our attempt to fit relatively low\nspectral resolution data pertaining to a complex multiphase plasma\nwith a simplistic spectral model, a problem which has in fact been\nwell documented in the literature (e.g. Strickland et al. 2000; Wang\net al. 2001). As noted by Kuntz et al. (2003), the abundances in the\nhot plasma in the central region of M101 are more likely to be near\nto solar rather than grossly subsolar.\nWe know that the measured XMM\u2013Newton spectrum includes\nsome residual contamination by the wings of the bright sources\n(estimated to be 9 per cent of the 0.3\u20131 keV count rate) and also\nincludes a contribution from the underlying unresolved source pop-\nulation (estimated to contribute 20 per cent of the 0.5\u20132 keV flux).\nSince the sources may have somewhat harder spectra than the diffuse\nemission, presumably they contribute preferentially to the higher\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors.

In the following analysis, we assume 50 per cent of the mea-\nsured hard emission is attributable to diffuse emission. We also scale\nthe component normalizations obtained from the spectral fitting so\nas to correct for both the area of the source mask and the differential\nnature of the spectral measurement (as detailed in Section 3.1).\nOne can infer mean physical properties of the hot diffuse gas\nonce some assumptions have been made regarding the geometry\nof the diffuse emission. Here, we assume that the gas is contained\nwithin a cylindrical region of radius of 10.5 kpc in the plane of\nthe galaxy (matching a 5 arcmin angular extent) with a half-width\nperpendicular to the plane of 0.5 kpc (representing the extent of\na putative shallow halo). Using this volume, the derived emission\nmeasure \u03b7n2e V (where \u03b7 is the \u2018filling factor\u2019 \u2013 the fraction of the\ntotal volume V which is occupied by the emitting gas) can be used to\ninfer the mean electron density ne.

We\nhave investigated this correlation using the FUV (1530 \u00c5) and NUV\n(2310 \u00c5) images of M101 from the GALEX pipeline (Morrissey\net al. 2005), together with images recorded by the XMM\u2013Newton\nOptical Monitor (OM) in the UVW1 (\u22482800 \u00c5), U, B and V filters\n(Mason et al. 2001). The latter were derived from data taken during\nObservation 1 (UVW1) and Observation 3 (U, B, V) and subject to\nthe standard SAS pipeline processing.\nTo aid the comparison, the soft X-ray image of Fig. 1(c) was\ncompressed in both coordinates by a factor of 4 (to give 17.4 \u00d7 17.4\narcsec2 pixel) and then lightly smoothed. The UV and optical images\nwere first rebinned into the same image format as the original soft\nX-ray data, blurred by a mask representative of the on-axis XMM\u2013\nNewton soft X-ray PSF and then further compressed in an identical\nway to the soft X-ray data.\nFig. 4 shows a detailed comparison of the 0.3\u20131 keV surface\nbrightness measured in the central 5 arcmin radius region of M101\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors.

The correlation of the surface brightness measured in the soft X-ray band with that measured in other wavebands from the FUV through to V. The\nunits in all cases are effectively counts per pixel. The numerical values quoted in each panel are the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient.\nwith the corresponding NUV, U- and V-band images. A striking\nsimilarity between the soft X-ray and U-band images is immediately\nobvious. In particular, the \u2018S-feature\u2019 which delineates the inner\nspiral structure of M101 is very prominent in both cases. The fall-\noff in the surface brightness towards the edges of the 5 arcmin\nfield is also very similar in both wavebands, with the north\u2013south\nasymmetry, evident at the level of the lowest soft X-ray contour level,\nalso present in the U-band image. Interestingly, the correspondence\nbecomes slightly less strong when the soft X-ray image is compared\nto both the NUV and V-band images. The NUV image is clearly\ntotally dominated by bright H II regions and young star associations\nwhich together delineate the spiral arms of the galaxy, whereas in\nthe soft X-ray image the general rise in surface brightness towards\nthe nucleus has more relative impact. It would seem highly unlikely\nthat these morphological trends could be induced by the increase in\nextinction as we move from the U band into the NUV. In contrast,\ncomparison with the V-band data veers in the other direction with\nthe soft X-ray image showing more structure outside the central 2\narcmin zone than the optical image.\nThe above trends are further illustrated in Fig. 5 which shows the\npixel-by-pixel correlation between the soft X-ray surface brightness\nand the optical\/UV surface brightness in the various wavebands.\n(Here, we use unsmoothed data with a pixel size of 34.8 \u00d7 34.8\narcsec2, i.e. a factor of 8 compression of the original images.) The\ncorrelation, as measured by the Pearson product moment correlation\ncoefficient, R, is at a maximum in the U band.\n4 D I S C U S S I O N\nAfter excluding bright point sources (with LX > 1037 erg s\u22121), we\nmeasure the residual soft X-ray luminosity of the inner (10.5 kpc\nradius) disc of M101 to be LX \u2248 2.1 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 (0.5\u20132 keV). Up\nto 20 per cent of this flux may originate in relatively bright point\nX-ray sources (with LX down to 1036 erg s\u22121), which remain unre-\nsolved in the XMM\u2013Newton observations. A further 5 per cent of the\nmeasured luminosity may be attributable to intermediate luminosity\nsources (with LX down to 1034 erg s\u22121) and, at very faint levels, the\nintegrated emission of dwarf stars may account for another 10 per\ncent contribution (Kuntz et al. 2003). Nevertheless, it seems that the\nbulk of observed X-ray emission is likely to be diffuse in origin.\nThe EPIC spectrum of the residual emission can be modelled as\nthe sum of two thermal plasma components at temperatures of \u22480.2\nand \u22480.7 keV with the harder component contributing 27 per cent\nof the flux in the 0.5\u20132 keV band (18 per cent in the 0.3\u20131 keV\nband). These spectral characteristics appear to be quite typical of\nthe diffuse components seen in normal and starburst galaxies (e.g.\nFraternali et al. 2002; Jenkins et al. 2004b,a) and, albeit with some\ncaveats, consistent with spectral measurements for M101 reported\nin the literature (Snowden & Pietsch 1995; Wang 1999; Kuntz et al.\n2003).\nEarlier studies have demonstrated that for normal spiral galax-\nies, the total soft X-ray luminosity correlates with the total infrared\nluminosity (Read & Ponman 2001; Strickland et al. 2004a,b), the\nlatter serving as a direct indicator of the current star formation rate.\nFor the diffuse X-ray components, this is in line with the mecha-\nnism whereby the mechanical energy input from supernovae and the\nwinds from young massive stars serves to heat the galactic ISM to\nmillion-degree temperatures. In the case of M101, the required rate\nof energy input is readily supplied by two supernovae per century\n(Matonick & Fesen 1997), if the efficiency of the conversion of the\nmechanical energy of the supernova explosion into X-rays is 1051\/E\nper cent, where E is the energy of the supernova in erg.\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors.

Warwick et al.\nThe linkage of X-ray emission to recent star formation is further\nstrengthened by the finding that in a number of galaxies the X-ray\nmorphology in the spiral arms matches that seen in the mid-infrared\nor H\u03b1 (Tyler et al. 2004). A recent Chandra study has demonstrated\nthat, in M101, the diffuse X-ray emission traces the spiral arms and\nis correlated with both the H\u03b1 and FUV emission (Kuntz et al. 2003).\nIn the same study, there was no evidence for any significant trend\nof X-ray spectral hardness with radius3 implying that the 0.2- and\n0.7-keV spectral components are closely linked with one another\nand are both associated with star formation.\nIn the present paper, we have investigated this correlation in more\ndetail by contrasting the X-ray morphology with that observed in\nFUV through to V band. We find that the correlation with the X-ray\nmorphology is quite strong for all bands considered (FUV, NUV,\nUVW1, U, B and V), although the best match is obtained with the\nU-band data. One interpretation of this result is that, in broad terms,\nthere are two underlying components present in the X-ray surface\nbrightness distribution, namely a smooth rise towards the centre of\nthe galaxy as reflected in the radial profile of the emission (Fig. 2)\nplus a superimposed X-ray spiral arm structure. In moving from the\nFUV through to the V band, clearly the balance shifts between the\nextreme Population I components (distributed in the spiral arms)\nand a more intermediate population (associated with the galactic\ndisc) and it is in the U band that this balance happens to best match\nthe X-ray morphology.\nIn the discs of spiral galaxies, star formation is thought to be\ntriggered by the passage of a spiral density wave through the ISM.\nThe formation of massive young stars results in a large UV\/FUV\nflux with reprocessing in the immediate environment subsequently\ngiving rise to associated H\u03b1 and mid-IR emission. All of these serve\nas tracers of the spiral arms of the galaxy. Population synthesis\nmodels predict that following a star-formation burst, the peak in\nthe UV\/H\u03b1 production will last \u223c 3 \u00d7 106 yr, whilst the most\nmassive stars complete their life cycle. The rate of energy deposition\ninto the ISM from the subsequent supernovae rises at this time and\nremains fairly constant for\u223c3\u00d7107 yr (Leitherer & Heckman 1995;\nCervino, Mas-Hesse & Kunth 2002). Given the lag between the\npeak in UV\/H\u03b1 emission and the X-ray heating, one might predict a\nspatial offset between the diffuse X-ray emission and the other spiral\ntracers, although as yet there is no clear observational evidence for\nsuch an effect (Tyler et al. 2004).\nIn the case of M101, we assume a flat rotation curve beyond a few\nkpc of the galaxy centre and a rotational velocity vrot \u2248 200 km s\u22121\n(Bosma, Goss & Allen 1981). We further assume that the spiral\npattern corotates with the disc material at three radial scalelengths,\ni.e. at r \u2248 15 kpc. Then at r \u2248 7.5 kpc a delay of 3 \u00d7 107 yr\ntranslates to a rotational lag of 24\u25e6 or about 3 kpc in a direction\nperpendicular to the spiral arm. The effective pixel size in our mul-\ntiwaveband correlation is 35 arcsec or 1.2 kpc, implying that a delay\nin the X-ray production following the passage of a spiral density\nwave might just be measurable in the current data. Unfortunately,\nthe restricted signal-to-noise ratio and limited clarity of the spiral\narm features in the X-ray image mitigates against the detection of\n3 We have subsequently checked the XMM\u2013Newton data for spectral trends\nby extracting images in the 0.3\u20130.8 and 0.8\u20131.2 keV subbands. The radial\nprofiles of the residual X-ray emission in these subbands are consistent with\nthe results obtained for the broader 0.3\u20131.0 keV band (see Fig. 2) and within\nthe errors, exhibit a constant ratio for radii in the range 1\u201310 arcmin. The\nXMM\u2013Newton observations thus confirm that there is no significant radial\ndependence of spectral hardness in this Galaxy.\nsuch an effect. Earlier we estimated a radiative cooling time-scale\nfor the more prominent 0.2-keV plasma component to be tsoft \u2248\n1.8 \u00d7 108 yr for a filling factor of \u03b7 \u223c 1. Clearly, this time-scale is\ninconsistent with the presence of reasonably narrow spiral features\nin the soft X-ray image. A very small filling factor, e.g. \u03b7 \u223c 0.01,\nis required to match the properties of X-ray spiral arms in M101,\nsuggesting a very clumpy thin-disc distribution. In fact, a reason-\nable scenario is that the spiral arms in X-rays are delineated by a\ncombination of truly diffuse emission, possibly in the form of hot\ngas bubbles and superbubbles, plus contributions from individual\nSNRs and concentrations of unresolved discrete sources. As noted\nby Kuntz et al. (2003), the available constraints suggest that su-\nperbubbles in the disc of M101 may have similar properties to the\nGalactic Loop I superbubble (Egger & Aschenbach 1995), although\nthey are not individually resolvable even in Chandra data. Where\nthere is no confinement by chimneys or similar structures in the\nISM, energy losses arising from adiabatic expansion of the hot gas\nin the disc into the lower halo of M101 may also help localize the\nspiral arm component [nb. in M101 the sound speed of the soft com-\nponent is comparable to the escape velocity from the disc (Kuntz\net al. 2003)].\nThe second spatial component of the X-ray emission considered\nabove broadly follows the distribution of the optical light attributable\nto the intermediate disc stellar population. The integrated X-ray\nemission of dwarf stars will presumably follow a disc distribution\nbut this is unlikely to represent a substantial contribution [10 per cent\noverall in the 0.5\u20132 keV band but, given the typical kT \u223c 0.8 keV\ntemperature of dwarf-star coronae, falling to \u22485 per cent in the\nsofter 0.3\u20131 keV band (Kuntz et al. 2003)]. Other contributions to\nthis smoother distribution might be expected from supernovae in\nthe interarm regions associated with disc population stars and X-\nray emitting gas which has accumulated in a shallow halo in M101\nas a result of galactic chimney\/fountain activity. In the case of the\nlatter, gas which has cooled substantially due to adiabatic expansion\nmay, as a result of a frozen-in non-ionization equilibrium, exhibit\nan emission spectrum dominated by oxygen lines, which mimics\nthat expected from a 0.2 keV plasma (Breitschwerdt & Schmutzler\n1999). The fact that the X-ray surface brightness increases towards\nthe centre of M101 is most naturally explained in terms of an increase\nin activity per unit disc area, with the filling factor of the extended z-\nheight component possibly approaching unity near the centre of the\ngalaxy. With the latter assumption, the implied electron density and\npressure in the inner halo of M101 are comparable to that inferred\nfor the centre of Galactic Loop I and the Local Hot Bubble.\n5 C O N C L U S I O N S\nThis is the third and final paper in a series presenting the results of\nXMM\u2013Newton observations of the nearby face-on Scd spiral galaxy\nM101. Here, we focus on the spatial and spectral properties of the\ngalaxy, when bright X-ray sources with LX > 1037 erg s\u22121 are re-\nmoved using an appropriate point source mask.\nThe residual soft X-ray luminosity of the central (10.5 kpc radius)\nregion of M101 was measured as LX \u2248 2.1 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 (0.5\u20132\nkeV), the bulk of which appears to originate as diffuse emission.\nWe find a two-temperature model best fits the spectral data with\nthe derived temperatures of 0.20 \u00b1 0.01 keV and 0.68+0.06\u22120.04 keV,\ntypical of the diffuse components seen in other normal and starburst\ngalaxies.\nIn line with earlier studies, we find that the observed X-ray surface\nbrightness distribution is well correlated with images recorded in\noptical\/UV wavebands.

Closer investigation suggests that the X-ray mor-\nphology may comprise both a spiral arm component and a smoother\ndisc component. In spiral galaxies, star formation is thought to be\ntriggered by the passage of a spiral density wave through the ISM.\nIn principle, one might observe a lag between more immediate star\nformation indicators such as the UV\/FUV flux or H\u03b1 and the heating\nof the ISM to X-ray temperatures as a result of subsequent super-\nnova. The XMM\u2013Newton data show no evidence for such an effect\nbut it may be observable in future high-resolution and high signal-\nto-noise data. Whereas the spiral arm component, on the basis of the\nradiative cooling time-scale of the 0.2-keV plasma, may be deduced\nto have a clumpy, low-z distribution, the smoother disc component\nmay represent longer lived X-ray gas with a relatively large filling\nfactor, which has been transported to the lower halo of M101 via\nthe galactic chimney\/fountain mechanism.\nFuture progress in understanding the X-ray properties of normal\nspiral galaxies will no doubt follow from very intensive studies of\nindividual galaxies [e.g. the recent 1 Ms observation of M101 with\nChandra (Kuntz et al. in preparation)] and by applying appropriately\noptimised analysis procedures to samples of nearby galaxies, as is\nnow possible using archival data sets.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nLPJ, TPR and RAO acknowledge PPARC support at various junc-\ntures during this project.
