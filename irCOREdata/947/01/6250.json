It sets\nout themes in current Learning Technology research within the context of institutional\npractice. It reports the responses of a range of e-learning support staff to new\ndevelopments in the reuse and sharing of Learning Objects. The article highlights\ntensions across support units, inconsistencies in support provision and confusion over\nissues concerning different modes of teaching. It also forewarns a growing gap between\ninstitutional practice and research in the development of approaches to sustainable e-\nlearning.\nIssues in developing flexible and sustainable e-learning\nThe United Kingdom government recently published a consultation document 'Towards a\nUnified E-Learning Strategy' focusing on flexible and sustainable e-learning (Department\nfor Education and Skills (DfES), 2003a). This document envisions e-learning as an integral\naspect of the learning and teaching environment, in which networked learners access richly\nstructured, highly accessible, interactive settings (MacFarlane, 1998; National Committee\nof Inquiry into Higher Education (NCIHE), 1997; DfES, 2003b). This vision of flexible\naccess to learning is shared by governments across the world who appreciate e-learning as\nbeing one way of providing education that can be adaptable and cost effective.\nHuge investments have already been made to provide an infrastructure that can support\nthe development of flexible curricula. However, the government is seeking to drive down\ndevelopment costs mainly through the promotion of sustainable approaches to e-learning\n(NCIHE, 1997, Appendix 2). Central to this approach is attaining a balance between costs\nand strategic benefits (Nicol and Coen, 2003). Evaluation of the benefits of e-learning is\nlargely subjective and there is an elaborate interplay between costs and benefits. An\nadditional complication is the fact that there are a variety of social, technological and\n88\nALT-] Volume I I Number 3\norganizational factors that impact on the quality of teaching and learning, therefore the\nbenefits arising from e-learning cannot be measured in isolation (Draper, Brown,\nHenderson and McAteer, 1996). Cost reduction is largely achieved through economies of\n' scale, so many recent initiatives have focused upon reducing costs through the reuse and\nsharing of learning materials - frequently referred to as Learning Objects (for example, the\nJlSC-funded Exchange for Learning Programme, X4L). According to Oliver and\nMacLaughlin (2003), 'The more reuse is considered in design, the more sustainable online\nteaching and learning can become.'\nIn an ideal world, these Learning Objects would be developed and shared by teachers and\nlearners. They would be designed so that they could be adapted to fit different subject\ndisciplines, levels of study and educational models (Koper, 2001). This would potentially\nlead to educational benefits, with students profiting from enhanced quality of learning as\nwell as improved access (DfES, 2003c). Additional benefits that can arise from e-Iearning\ninclude increased innovation, enhanced public profile, increased staff satisfaction and\nmotivation and increased wealth creation (Nicol and Coen, 2003).\nDespite these claims, many lecturers remain sceptical of the perceived benefits and have\nbeen slow to adopt e-learning (Green, 1999; Campbell, 2003). Staff training in 'how to use'\nvarious types of supporting educational tools has not led to a dramatic increase in the use\nof these tools, for purposes other than the delivery of course materials. As Crook (2002)\nobserved: 'Clearly academics do master other information technology tools routinely\nwhere they are perceived as powerful resources for their work.' Why, therefore, has there\nbeen limited use of e-learning tools by academics? One reason is because designing and\nimplementing a course is much more complex than simply sending e-mail, or using\nPowerpoint for presentations. Academics need clear support in how to perform difficult\ntasks such as designing, assembling and implementing courses supported by technology.\nThis requires a coherent, supporting infrastructure comprising not only the required\ntechnologies and network systems, but also organizational structures (for example, local\nand national support mechanisms), and the people that make these systems work\n(including support staff and learning technologists) (DfES, 2003a, para 49).\nFaced with the challenge of facilitating change across institutions, support staff are\nfrequently confronted by tensions and conflicts that arise across academic departments as\nwell as within support units themselves (McNaught, 2002). This article outlines these\ntensions and describes ways in which they may inhibit the advancement of sustainable e-\nlearning. It describes the outcomes of phase 1 of a national forum for support staff, funded\nby the UK Learning and Teaching Support Network Generic Centre. The forum aimed to\ngive support staff an opportunity to explore ways in which learning technology research,\nparticularly in the area of interoperability, might impact upon future provision for e-\nlearning support. The unique aspect of this article is that it sets out current themes in\nlearning technology research within the context of institutional practice, providing an\ninsider view of the positive and negative aspects of existing support for e-learning. The\narticle explores potential meanings of 'sustainable e-learning', examines current modes of\nsupport and investigates the implications of balancing costs and benefits.\n89\nAllison Litzlejohn Supporting sustainable e-leaming\nImplementing a UK National Forum\nA variety of government-funded organizations already exist to support the development of\nsustainable e-learning. For example the Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN)\nis a national network for staff working in Higher Education, with twenty-four Subject\nCentres and a Generic Centre. Each centre has provided considerable support for the\ndevelopment of e-learning in higher education, and in doing so has begun to question the\nsustainable characteristics of recent developments, in particular the drive toward content\ncreation. The LTSN has sought to promote the sustainability of e-learning by encouraging\nits embedding within teaching practice and through working with support staff to tease\nout practical strategies towards this end (Wiles and Littlejohn, 2003).\nIn 2003, the LTSN Generic Centre established the Supporting Sustainable eLearning\nForum as an opportunity for the exchange of ideas by a wide range of support staff,\neducational developers and learning technologists from the United Kingdom higher and\nfurther education communities. The aim of the forum was to devise practical strategies for\nsupporting staff in the design, development and implementation of online courses; to\ndisseminate good practice in supporting sustainable approaches to e-learning; and to\ncontribute to the ongoing debate on the sharing and reuse of e-learning resources. Through\nthe forum, practitioners were invited to examine how to move e-learning on from project to\nembedded practice, and address questions around the scaleable nature of e-learning.\nThe forum had four main themes, each of which was explored during four one-day sessions\nheld in 2003 at the University of Strathclyde (March), the LTSN Generic Centre in York\n(April), the Open University (May) and the University of Bristol (June). These themes\nwere: designing sustainable online courses, implementing sustainable online courses, the\ndesign and development of reusable materials, and institutional change. Each session was\nbased on contributions, collaboration, construction and communication of new ideas: an\napproach used successfully by Harris and Higgison (2003). During each session key\ncontributors were invited to present ideas, through draft commentaries and presentations.\nParticipants could share ideas and collaborate by brainstorming ideas during discussion\nfora. The ideas generated were drawn together to work towards and construct new models\nof staff development. These were communicated through the forum Website and an\nelectronic discussion list.\nThe seventy-five forum members represented fifty different (mainly higher education)\ninstitutions from across the United Kingdom. Members were mostly support staff,\nincluding learning technologists, librarians, audio-visual staff, IT support staff and\ndirectors of learning and teaching centres. Their experiences of potential tensions in\nembedding sustainable e-learning and their responses to issues in current research and how\nthis could impact upon learning and teaching practice are outlined in the following\nsections.\nWhat is 'sustainable e-learning'?\nE-learning is a term that is used in radically different ways by different people. Key\ncontributor Martin Oliver led an interactive session in which he asked forum delegates to\nwrite down their personal definition of 'e-learning'. Most delegates did not find this task\nstraightforward and a wide variety of definitions were drawn up. This is unsurprising, since\n90\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 3\nthere is similar ambiguity in the literature. Kaplan-Leiserson (2000) has a broad definition\nin which she asserts that e-learning is a 'term covering a wide set of applications and\nprocesses, such as Web-based learning, computer-based learning, virtual classrooms and\ndigital collaboration. It includes the delivery of content via Internet, intranet\/extranet\n(LAN\/WAN), audio and video tape, satellite broadcast, interactive TV, CD-ROM and\nmore.' This definition alludes to the use of learning activities supported by technology; it\nmay also refer to systems used for content delivery, for example, to distribute lecture notes,\nhandouts and course information. Jackson (2002) attempts to differentiate between these\nby defining e-learning in two ways: as technology-enhanced learning and technology-\ndelivered learning,\nTechnology-enhanced learning is illustrated by the numerous modes of e-learning that\nexploit the communicative aspects of networked technology. Many cases in point are from\nthe field of open and distance learning, particularly within continuing professional\ndevelopment courses leading to professional accreditation (Timms, Booth, Crompton,\nKlein, Bangali and Schnuekel, 1999; Ingraham, Watson, McDowell, Brockett and\nFitzpatrick, 2001). This is partly influenced by the fact that students on distance learning\ncourses often have limited scope for dialogue with tutors and peers.\nExamples of technology-delivered learning are frequently found across campus-based\ninstitutions, where students' needs and expectations are different. A study by Crook and\nBarrowcliff (2001) presents a representative snapshot of the use of e-learning by campus-\nbased undergraduate students. It is interesting to note that both lecturers and students\nadvocate the use of e-learning systems primarily to supplement the face-to-face\ninteractions of lectures and tutorials for the distribution of lecture notes, handouts and\ncourse information. Therefore, it is important to recognize that the term 'e-learning' can\ndescribe a range of learning methodologies and also to draw distinctions across the\napplication of e-learning for undergraduate, postgraduate, campus-based learning,\ndistance learning and work-based education. Frequently, in discussion on e-learning, these\napproaches to learning are grouped together, which is confusing for academics.\nDelegates were also unclear on the notion of 'sustainable'. According to the National Com-\nmittee of Inquiry into Higher Education (1997, Appendix 2), sustainable e-learning is the\nadoption of technology to maintain teaching quality at reduced unit costs. A variety of\ninitiatives are achieving this through economies of scale (Collis and Moonen, 2001). These\nprogrammes are focusing on the development of learning materials as Learning Objects that\nare described by metadata, classified and stored in digital repositories, where they can be easily\naccessed, recombined and reused within online courses (for example Exchange for Learning,\nX4L; Resource Discovery Network, RDN). For the purposes of the forum 'sustainable e-\nlearning' was defined as 'the design and development of online courses that could easily be\nupdated or scaled up'. Central to this definition were notions of repurposing and reusing\nLearning Objects. This definition was not intended to be comprehensive, but rather served to\nhelp delegates and contributors discuss issues from a common perspective.\nHow is e-learning development currently supported?\nCommon perspectives in terms of e-learning support are seldom achieved. This is partly\nbecause e-learning support structures vary widely across institutions (Beetham, 2001).\n91\nAllison Utllejohn Supporting sustainable e-leaming\nThey range from centralized 'learning service', 'teaching and learning' and 'academic\npractice' units to decentralized support within faculties frequently located in IT support\nunits and libraries. The staff working within these units have a variety of responsibilities\n(Oliver, 2003). Staff with similar roles took part within the forum, representing their\nrespective cultures, driving forces and agendas. Therefore, it was unsurprising that forum\ndelegates frequently had different views of e-learning and its focus. Some delegates\nreported that the support and advice offered to an academic seeking assistance is\nfrequently biased towards the perspective of an individual support staff member or unit.\nFor example, advice given to an academic seeking help from an audio-visual unit may be\nvery different from the advice that might be given to the same academic with a similar\nproblem by a learning and teaching unit. While it is useful to be offered a range of\nopinions, much of the advice offered to academics tends to focus on content, rather than\non underpinning educational issues. Content issues are relatively easy to address,\ncompared with complex pedagogical problems, and therefore may appear to offer a simple\n(and therefore attractive) solution.\nInconsistencies in approaches to staff support have arisen, due partly to the large number of\nsupport units existing within institutions. Inevitably, tensions arise across and between these\nunits, leading to contradictions in support provision. This is largely caused by the uncertainty\nof support staff roles and identities in a rapidly changing environment (Oliver, 2002). An e-\nlearning strategy could tackle issues of poor communication between groups of support staff\nand with academics by aiming to promote better cohesion and collaboration. Existing\nstrategies that have proved to be successful are frequently based upon partnerships with\nacademic 'champions', or round-table discussion methodology (Ehrmann, 1998).\nFeedback from participants indicated a variety of conflicts that hinder e-learning\nimplementation. In an interactive session led by key contributor Grainne Conole, forum\ndelegates were invited to reflect upon the variety of ways in which e-learning is currently\nsupported within their institutions and explore these underlying tensions (SSeLF, Conole\nbriefing paper, 2003). Most institutions offer a wide range of staff development activities.\nThese include awareness-raising events (workshops, institutional conferences, etc.) as well\nas tailored support, including departmental sessions, away days, one-to-one staff\nmentoring and institutional development projects. Many institutions provide accredited,\npostgraduate courses leading to membership of the UK Institute for Learning and\nTeaching in Higher Education. However, there is a noticeable move away from traditional\nworkshops and courses towards developing partnership with academics (for example, on\nprogramme development, joint writing funding bids or working within formal\naccreditation programmes and learning and teaching committees). Another form of\npartnership is through joint development of learning resources (for example, online\nguidelines, templates and case studies or portals linking to relevant external materials and\nsupport).\nInstitutions have diverse implementation strategies for staff support programmes. The\nstructure of each programme is largely influenced by a range of context-specific driving\nforces that vary across institutions, schools and faculties. Local drivers include research\nagendas, pressure from external professional organizations and partnerships with other\ninstitutions. There are additional drivers resulting from national government policy such as\ninclusion and quality enhancement. These influencing factors frequently contradict one\n92\nAa-] Volume 11 Number 3\nanother; however, staff support programmes have evolved that use these conflicts to their\nadvantage. For example, programmes exploring the development of accessible learning\nresources can also be designed to take account of new content requirements stipulated by\nprofessional bodies.\nTensions arising between local and national agendas can result in national e-learning\ninitiatives having limited impact at an institutional level, especially for short-term projects\n(Littlejohn and Peacock, 2003). Funding bodies expect that project outcomes will be easily\nembedded within institutions, but there has been limited institutional support for staff\ndevelopers in achieving this goal. This could reflect conflicting approaches to collabor-\nation: externally funded projects are frequently based upon the premise that collaboration\namong institutions is mutually beneficial. However, institutions may have a more\nintrospective and competitive culture, which does not always facilitate collaboration. This\ntension could be reduced through support staff being actively involved in the planning of\nlearning and teaching strategies to ensure that the outcomes of national projects are linked\nto local initiatives (McNaught, 2002). The proposed Academy for the Advancement of\nLearning and Teaching in Higher Education could help strengthen these links.\nHow can costs be reduced?\nThe DfES consultation document suggests that e-learning can reduce costs in a variety of\nways. First, e-learning can improve the running of the organization by automating admin-\nistrative functions (DfES, 2003a, para 71). Second, it has the potential to increase teaching\nefficiency and may help address shortages of resources and teachers in certain subject areas\n(para 61). Thirdly, resources can be reused and shared across courses and subject disciplines\n(para 56). Over the past few years, cost-reduction strategies have largely focused on the reuse\nof content. However, other types of resources, such as student activities and course designs, can\nalso be reused (Koper, 2003). All these types of resources can be copied and reused using\nLearning Management Systems (LMS), sometimes referred to as Virtual Learning Environ-\nments. An LMS is a software environment integrating a series of tools which can support a\nrange of teaching and learning activities (Britain and Liber, 2000). Using these tools academic\nstaff can set up online courses without the need for intensive IT training. Forum contributor,\nBarbara Newland, reported on her work in reusing course designs within a Learning\nManagement System, Blackboard (SSeLF, briefing paper by Newland, 2003). For several\nyears Newland has been developing strategies for supporting large numbers of academics in\nusing Blackboard at the University of Durham. This support involves assisting, academics in\ndesigning courses made up of reusable student activities as well as reusable content resources.\nAt Durham reusable content sourced from academics, audio-visual staff and publishing\nhouses has been redeployed across several different modules. A range of student activities\nhas also been reused. This includes online discussion tasks, group project assignments,\ncomputer-marked and computer-managed assessments as well as interactive simulations.\nIn addition, academics have redeployed course designs that have proved to be effective (for\nexamples, see the LEAP Website). These designs were duplicated within Blackboard and\nrepurposed by the original course designer, or other academics. According to Newland, 'At\nthe end of the academic year the course is ready for the next year with the same content\nand with a new set of students. The academic can just click radio buttons to make\nmaterials available or unavailable at certain dates.'\n93\nAllison Uttlejohn Supporting sustainable e-leaming\nRepurposing, rather than reusing resources, can feel more comfortable to academics and\ncan help increase their teaching efficiency. Most academics already have content resources\nthat they use during lectures and tutorial sessions and content from a single module can be\ndigitized, redesigned and repurposed for reuse in other modules. Mary Thorpe described a\nprocess of repurposing content that has been pioneered at the UK Open University\n(Thorpe, Kubiak and Thorpe, 2003). During this process, existing learning resources, such\nas text documents, images, etc., are transformed into free-standing Learning Objects that\ncan be updated, 'without creating knock-on effects to any other part of a course'. There\nare two critical factors that are essential to this process: clear structuring of texts that can\neasily be adapted during the authoring process, and the application of metadata, enabling\nthe resources to be searchable (SSeLF, briefing paper by Thorpe, 2003).\nThe difference between repurposing and reusing content is important within the context of\nhigher education, since most HE lecturers prefer to reuse their own materials. However,\nwithin the primary, secondary and further education sectors, there is a longstanding,\npervasive culture of reusing standardized learning materials. Gerry Graham, of 'Learning\nand Teaching Scotland', presented his experiences in supporting teachers across Scotland\nto share digital learning resources. These resources are stored within a central digital\nrepository. Teachers can search for Learning Objects by keying terms into a search tool.\nThe search results return metadata information about each resource, such as the author,\nformat and description of the resource. This information can help teachers quickly\nevaluate the suitability of each resource within their own teaching situation (SSeLF,\nbriefing paper by Graham, 2003).\nLearning Objects can be submitted to a repository in a variety of formats. During the\nprocess of uploading, the resources will be described using metadata elements holding\ninformation about the author, educational intent, etc. This information is linked to the\nLearning Object as metadata. To complete the upload process to the digital repository, the\nLearning Object is classified using an educational taxonomy. Metadata is crucial to this\nprocess for a variety of reasons. It enables searching and sourcing of content resources; it\nallows authorships and associated rights to be retained; it facilitates communication of\neducational intent; and it permits matching of learners' needs with appropriate content\n(SSeLF, Stiles briefing paper, 2003). Until now, most institutions have implemented\nLearning Management Systems that do not support these functions, restricting the reuse\nand sharing of resources and limiting opportunities to reduce costs.\nForum responses\nMany forum delegates had attempted to reduce costs within their institution by\nencouraging the sharing and reuse of resources. However, this process was frequently\ncomplicated by a series of technological and social issues. Delegates identified several\ntechnological problems that had inhibited resource sharing with academic staff. In their\nexperience, several commercial systems (such as Blackboard and WebCT) did not allow for\neasy resource sharing, resulting in duplication of materials within institutions. This\nshortcoming frequently led to further problems, since multiple copies of single resources\nhad to be updated individually. Temporary solutions had been tested, including storing\nresources at a location outwith the Learning Management System and creating links to\nthese resources from online courses contained within the LMS. However, this method had\n94\nALT-] Volume I I Number 3\nlimited success, since there was no means by which academics could source available\nresources. The best solution was to store resources within a searchable database or digital\nrepository.\nDelegates confirmed they had encountered a variety of social factors inhibiting resource\nsharing. These included academics' confidence in sharing self-generated materials,\nconcerns over Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), the time required by them to implement\nmetadata tagging or to upload resources. Three potential solutions were suggested to\nimprove confidence in sharing and reusing materials. First, to build academics' confidence\nin reusing resources by making available 'off the shelf materials. Second, to encourage\nlecturers to reuse their own materials, initially by themselves, then with close colleagues\nwithin their subject discipline, school or faculty. Third, to advise academics to share\nstudents activities and course designs as well as content resources. While the use of\nmetadata may reduce concerns in terms of IPR, the time required to describe resources\nwith metadata is a major disincentive for most staff. A potential solution to this problem is\nto encourage lecturers to describe resources with small amounts of metadata. This would\nallow them to gauge the benefits of using metadata, without requiring a large, initial time\ninput.\nA major factor critical to the successful reuse of Learning Objects is the degree of\nownership felt by the academic. Consequently resources are most likely to be reused by the\noriginal author. Resources created by a support unit have a greater chance of being reused\nif developed in partnership with the academic. However, externally generated resources\nhave much less chance of being reused in higher education. Extensive funding has\ngenerated a variety of nationally available, reusable Learning Objects (for example X4L,\nRDN). In order to encourage the reuse of these resources closer links must be formed\nbetween these national initiatives and departments within institutions. Once again, the\nproposed Academy for the Advancement of Learning and Teaching in Higher Education\ncould strengthen these links.\nDelegates reported that few institutions had reduced costs through the automation of\nadministrative functions. All the universities and colleges represented had implemented\ncomputer-marked assessment software, though student records usually had to be\ntransferred to record systems manually. Some had linked computer-assessment software\nwith student record systems. Although there were no reports of fully integrated systems,\nsome institutions were planning to implement these within the next academic year. These\nintegrated structures will have a major impact on the development of student portfolios\n(an area that will be further explored in phase 2 of the SSeLF forum).\nA large proportion of the 'reuse' debate has focused on content development. However, the\nstrengths of higher education institutions lies in 'softer' areas. Mark Stiles summed this up\nby stressing that, 'educational institutions do not sell \"content\", but rather the provision of\naccess to expertise and support, assessment and accreditation of learning.' Therefore, it is\nimportant to explore ways in which educational benefits can be maximized.\nHow can benefits be increased?\nThe benefits of implementing sustainable e-learning can be viewed at three levels within an\n95\nAllison Utdejonn Supporting sustainable e-learning\ninstitution: educational, organizational and external (Nicol and Coen, 2003).\nDevelopments within the educational and organizational spheres will inevitably impact\nupon the external perception of an institution. If the technology is working well and\nstudents are being provided with better education, this will have a major, positive impact.\nAny negative impact is likely to reduce the potential for income generation, so\nenhancement in the educational sphere will focus on learning and the learner.\nDevelopments are likely to be influenced by the emergence of new systems that allow\nlecturers easily to design courses based on different educational models. One such\napproach, based on Learning Design, a notational system currently being developed by\nIMS (www.ims.org), was presented by Colin Tattersall of the Open University of the\nNetherlands (SSeLF, Tattersall briefing paper, 2003). Learning Design involves course\ndesigns in which students are assigned activities (or tasks) and roles (for example group\nmoderator, reporter, etc.). Students have access to content appropriate to each task. The\nsustainability of courses is determined by the reuse of all these types of resources: content,\nactivities and learning designs (Koper, 2003). This approach requires a shift in the way e-\nlearning is implemented and supported. Learning Management Systems that are being\ndeveloped around Learning Design (see, for example, Dalziel, 2002) encourage academics\nto design courses that are based on student activities linked to learning objectives.\nAccording to Tattersall, 'It recognises that learning can happen without learning objects,\nthat learning is different from content consumption and that. . . learning happens when\nlearners cooperate to solve problems in social and work situations.'\nA critical factor affecting reuse is the size of a Learning Object. Newland reported that\nsmaller resources could be more easily adapted to specific learning contexts. These ideas\nwere further explored by Boyle (2002), who presented his research examining the\nrelationship between the degree of reusability of a Learning Object and its size. Boyle's aim\nwas to ascertain whether or not a there is a favourable size that makes materials more\nreusable. He discovered that the size ultimately depends upon the 'level' of reuse. Boyle\nclassified reuse at four levels. At a basic level simple 'information objects' or 'learning\nobjects' could be reused. At a more complex level, these objects could be aggregated to\nform larger 'topic based learning activity structures' or 'course based learning activity\nstructures'.\nBoyle's research has demonstrated that the reuse of Learning Objects at different levels can\nimprove learning. However, many lecturers remain sceptical of the value of using Learning\nObjects, believing this approach leads to a fragmented, reductionist pedagogy. This issue\nwas explored by Robin Mason, of the UK Open University. Mason believes that designing\ncourses comprising Learning Objects (both student activity and information resources) can\n'provide a rich learning environment and allow for easy updating and re-versioning'\n(SSeLF, Mason briefing paper). The four areas in which she believes the reuse of Learning\nObjects can promote a student-centred approach to learning include the accommodation\nof learner diversity; learner choice and selection; activity or problem-based learning (which\nresonates with the Learning Design approach); and interactivity and collaborative work.\nShe considers that, in the future, there is likely to be greater emphasis on developing the\ninteractive and communicative nature of the Web. Students will create their own Learning\nObjects, upload these resources to a repository and draw upon those of their peers. Work is\nalready under way to explore not only how to capture ideas, as Learning Objects, but the\n96\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 3\nprocess by which these ideas were developed (DIDET). This may be achieved by capturing\nunwritten thoughts and courses of action as metadata.\nWhen teachers create resources, they naturally embed them within a particular context.\nHowever, to extend their potential for reuse, resources should be context-free and should\nnot contain information specific to a particular subject discipline or course. This\ncontradicts the way that lecturers normally modify and adapt resources to fit specific\nteaching situations, disciplines and abilities of students. Patrick McAndrew addressed this\ncritical issue by posing the following question: 'If some software, for example, is used in\none situation to support learners working at a distance in their own time, and then the\nsame software is used on campus in a fixed time tutorial, what is the most useful aspect to\ntransfer across?' (SSeLF, McAndrew briefing paper). McAndrew drew upon five potential\nways in which these aspects could be addressed: metadata tagging, open source courseware,\nReusable Learning Objects, Reusable Learning Activities and community building. He\nconcluded that automatic metadata tagging is a potential time-reducing incentive to\nencourage the uploading of resources to shared repositories. However, McAndrew voiced\nhis concern that focusing development in this area may 'design the people out of systems\nwhen the subtlety of education means that they should be very much designed in'. His\nsuggestion is to link multiple methods in order to provide a more holistic approach.\nE-learning systems can enhance the organizational aspects of an institution by automating\nroutine administrative processes. Unfortunately, most Learning Management Systems are\nnot currently set up to allow lecturers to carry out these operations. Integration of a series\nof complex functions across an institution requires a strategic approach linking a range of\npolicies, procedures, roles and responsibilities. According to Mark Stiles, 'it includes such\nthings as staff development as well as quality assurance, procedures for the validation and\napproval of new courses, academic monitoring, and the various procedures associated with\nthe recruitment, enrolment, charging, assessment and accreditation of students' (SSeLF,\nStiles briefing paper, 2003). Stiles presented a case study of how this had been attempted at\nthe University of Staffordshire, highlighting the ways in which interoperability standards\nhad helped and hindered the process. While metadata was vital to operating a policy of\nreusing Learning Objects, the standards also proved to be restrictive. For example, when\nrelocating a course to a new system, IMS Content Packaging allows the content to be\npackaged with a simple linear structure and transported. However, it does not preserve the\nmore complex structure nor the educational intent (Wilson and Currier, 2002). Therefore it\nis essential that teachers and learners are involved in the standards debate to help develop\nstandards that will underpin future systems that meet academics' and students'\nrequirements (SSeLF, Corley briefing paper, 2003).\nForum responses\nSeveral delegates were concerned that the current focus on reusing content has distracted\nlecturers from course design. As a result academic staff often begin designing courses by\ndeveloping content, afterwards tagging learning design around the available content\nresources. Consequently, course designs tend to overemphasize the use of information\nresources, rather than learner engagement in activities. In general, the smaller or more\ngranular a resource the greater the possibility that it will be reused in another educational\ncontext. However, larger resources may have greater educational value and may be less time-\n97\nAllison Utdejohn Supporting sustainable e-leaming\nconsuming for a lecturer to reuse a larger resource, such as a learning activity, rather than\nconstructing a course from its most basic components. Therefore, in terms of resource size,\ndelegates identified a conflict between the educational value and the ease of interoperability.\nAcademics often have a clear idea about the content they want to use, but are most likely to\nrequire guidance and support in reusing course designs or activities. It is important that\nteaching staff are encouraged to design courses and develop student activities before\ndeciding on the content resources. However, a significant number of support staff have\nlimited understanding of pedagogical issues and might also tend to focus on content\ndevelopment. Therefore, in order to shift the focus from content to course design issues, it\nis critical that support units work cooperatively. This is most likely to happen when support\nstaff are assigned clear roles and feel secure while working within multi-disciplinary teams.\nDelegates reported that academics often confuse technological and educational issues. This\narises from the fact that current Learning Management Systems do not allow easy\ndevelopment of courses based upon diverse educational models. Most systems adopt specific\npedagogical approaches that tend to be fixed. This only allows any one LMS to be used\nwithin a limited range of contexts: use outwith this context usually requires a great deal of\nimagination and skill by the academic. Learning Management Systems are equally\nuncompromising in allowing students actively to negotiate assessments, to set up online\ndiscussions, or to develop and upload their own learning resources. Therefore, it is important\nthat future Learning Management Systems should allow more flexible development of\ncourses based on a wide variety of educational models. A prototype Learning Activity\nManagement System (LAMS) is currently under development (Dalziel, 2002). While LAMs\nis not yet based on IMS Learning Design, it does use many of its elements.\nA surprisingly large proportion of delegates were unaware of developments in Learning\nDesign. This reflects the gap that exists between educational 'research' and 'practice'\ncultures. Many (though not all) of the support staff who are involved in current debates\nover the development of e-learning standards are involved in research. However, delegates\nperceived a mismatch between the ideas of the 'standards development community' and\nthe practice of staff dealing with day-to-day learning and teaching issues. It is essential that\nthe ideas being formulated by this research are fully tested in real situations if possible\n(with large numbers of students and within realistic timescales) and that the 'research' and\n'practice' communities communicate more effectively.\nCommentary\nThis forum has highlighted major challenges that concern the development of a unified e-\nlearning strategy. Many of these challenges are social and organizational issues, rather\nthan pedagogical or technological concerns. Some are related to the fast rate of change e-\nlearning has experienced in recent years. This rapid change has led to anxiety for support\nstaff, as well as tensions-developing between support units, as mutual areas of engagement\nbegin to overlap. If institutions are to take more responsibility for e-learning planning and\nprovision (DfES, 2003a, para 59), the cooperative functioning of these units is an area\ndeserving significant consideration.\nSecond, a related tension is the synergy between learning technology support staff and\nacademic staff and the issue of deficiencies in communication between these groups. This\n98\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 3\nissue is partly being resolved by the move away from a 'support' to a 'partnership' culture.\nThese partnerships have, in some cases, extended to include work with students developing\ntheir own learning resources. These kinds of collaborations are likely to become\nincreasingly important.\nThird, there is a growing gap between institutional practice and research. This is likely to\nresult in the benefits arising from research not being implemented at a local level. This\nproblem is part of a wider issue in which national initiatives are not embedded within local\ninstitutions. National bodies, such as the Learning and Teaching Support Network, or the\nAcademy for the Advancement of Learning and Teaching in Higher Education, could help\nforge stronger links.\nFourth, the continued use of imprecise terms without clear definition adds unnecessary\nintricacy to an already complex situation. The inconsistencies in, terminology amongst e-\nlearning support staff will confuse the academics they support.\nFinally, viewing e-leaming as being somehow separate from other kinds of learning is not\nhelpful when trying to devise new pedagogical designs (DfES, 2003a, para 56). It would be\nbetter to view e-learning as mainstream to learning and teaching practice, rather than as an\nadd-on. This may help to disentangle the complexity of issues associated with different\nmodes of teaching (distance learning, campus-based learning, continuing professional\ndevelopment, etc.).\nIn summary, the development of a unified strategy to promote sustainable approaches to e-\nlearning requires major shifts in support and leadership. Some of the greater challenges\npertain to cultural and social issues, rather than technological concerns. These will be\nfurther explored in the next set of SSeLF forum sessions which are due to take place early\nin 2004.\nAcknowledgements\nThe ideas within this paper have been amalgamated from a considerable body of work by\nthe key contributors: Gerry Graham (LT Scotland), Lisa Corley (CETIS), Dr Colin\nTattersall (OUNL), Professor Tom Boyle (London Metropolitan University), Professor\nMark Stiles (University of Staffordshire), Dr Barbara Newland (University of Durham),\nProfessor Robin Mason, Professor Mary Thorpe, Dr Patrick McAndrew (all from the\nOpen University, UK), Dr Martin Oliver (University College London), Professor Grainne\nConole (University of Southampton) and Ros O'Leary (University of Bristol).
