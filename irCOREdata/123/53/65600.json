Normative and, unexpectedly, affective commitment were higher in the \nChinese sample, and continuance commitment was higher amongst the British. There was \nsome support for hypotheses on the consequences of the components of occupational \ncommitment (occupational withdrawal cognitions and the intention to participate in \nprofessional activities). However, contrary to our hypotheses, our analysis suggested that \nthere were no significant differences in these relationships between the two samples.  We \nfound a significant interaction between affective and continuance commitment in the analysis \nof occupational withdrawal cognitions, such that the relationship between each of these \ncomponents and withdrawal cognitions was stronger where commitment on the other \ncomponent was low. \n \n \n \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n3 \n \nThe Three-Component Model of Occupational Commitment:  \nA Comparative Study of Chinese and British Accountants \n \nMeyer and Allen\u201fs (1997) model of organizational commitment has received a great \ndeal of research attention, and the three-component approach of affective, normative and \ncontinuance commitment has been extended to occupational commitment (Meyer, Allen & \nSmith, 1993; Irving, Coleman & Cooper, 1997; Snape & Redman, 2003). All commitments \nare concerned with the binding of individuals to specific courses of action. For organizational \ncommitment, this action is relevant to an employing organization, whilst for occupational \ncommitment the action is relevant to an occupation (Meyer & Herscovitch, 2001). More \nspecifically, occupational commitment is defined by Meyer et al. as a \u201ccommitment to a \nparticular line of work\u201d (1993: 540). Organizational commitment has received more research \nattention than occupational commitment (Lee, Carswell, & Allen, 2000), but the latter may \nbecome more important, especially if employees shift their commitment towards their \noccupations as single-organizational careers become more uncertain.  \nThere is a need to evaluate the dimensionality and consequences of occupational \ncommitment in the Chinese context. Cultural differences might conceivably have \nimplications for how individuals commit to courses of action, for example with normative \nconsiderations being especially salient in a collectivist culture (e.g., Yao & Wang, 2006). \nWestern studies have suggested that occupational commitment underpins the intention to \nremain in an occupation and to actively participate in professional activities, for example by \nattending professional meetings and participating in professional development (Meyer, Allen \n& Smith, 1993; Irving, Coleman & Cooper, 1997; Snape & Redman, 2003). We need to \nestablish the extent to which these relationships generalize to China if we are to understand \nhow Chinese professionals commit to, and participate in, their occupations. This is especially \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n4 \n \nimportant as professionals are likely to play a key role in the PRC\u201fs economy and society. A \nbetter understanding of the individual\u201fs relationship with their profession may provide \ninsights into the development of professions as self-regulating occupational communities, and \nso further our understanding of the social and economic development process. In particular, \nregulators and professional associations will benefit from a better understanding of the nature \nof individuals\u201f occupational commitment and of the factors likely to motivate individuals to \nremain in their occupation and to participate actively.  \nIn this paper, we contribute to the literature on occupational commitment in three \nways. First, we re-evaluate the Meyer et al. (1993) three-component model of occupational \ncommitment in the Chinese context, using a sample of accountants from the Peoples\u201f \nRepublic of China (PRC). Specifically, we test for measurement equivalence between this \nand a British sample. Whilst there have been studies of the three-component model of \norganizational commitment using Chinese (Chen & Francesco, 2003; Cheng & Stockdale, \n2003) and South Korean samples (Ko, Price & Mueller, 1997; Lee, Allen, Meyer & Rhee, \n2001), there is a need to evaluate the three-component model of occupational commitment in \nan Asian context. An Asian study of occupational commitment known to us is a study of \nTaiwanese nurses, but this does not involve a direct comparison with a Western sample \n(Chang, Chi & Miao, 2007). Second, we examine the outcomes of occupational commitment. \nWe focus on occupational withdrawal cognitions (i.e., the extent to which the individual is \nconsidering leaving the occupation) and the intention to participate in professional activities, \nand we compare the relationships across the Chinese and British samples. Finally, we \nexamine whether the observed interactions between the commitment components in \npredicting withdrawal cognitions seen in recent Western studies of organizational and \noccupational commitment extend to the accounting and Chinese contexts.  \nThe Meyer & Allen Model of Commitment \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n5 \n \nThe Meyer and Allen (1997) three-component model of commitment consists of \naffective, normative and continuance components. Affective commitment is values based, \ninvolving identification and enthusiasm. In contrast, normative commitment is based on a \nsense of obligation, whilst continuance commitment reflects high perceived costs of quitting. \nThere is considerable support for the three-component model of organizational commitment \n(e.g., Meyer & Allen, 1997). Meyer et al. (1993) generalized the three-component model to \nfocus on commitment to an occupation. The three-component model of occupational \ncommitment has received empirical support amongst nurses (Meyer et al., 1993), Canadian \ngovernment employees (Irving et al., 1997), and UK human resource management specialists \n(Snape & Redman, 2003). \nThere have been several studies of the three-component model of organizational \ncommitment in the Chinese (Chen & Francesco, 2003; Cheng and Stockdale, 2003) and the \nSouth Korean context (Ko, Price & Mueller, 1997; Lee, Allen, Meyer & Rhee, 2001). In \ngeneral, the studies provide support for the three-factor model relative to alternative factor \nstructures (Chen & Francesco, 2003; Cheng and Stockdale, 2003; Ko, Price & Mueller, 1997; \nLee, Allen, Meyer & Rhee, 2001), in some cases with fit indices similar to those found in the \noriginal Canadian samples (e.g., Cheng and Stockdale, 2003: 479). We anticipate that these \nfindings on the applicability of the three-component model of organizational commitment in \nan Asian context, which suggests that the affective, normative and continuance bases of \ncommitment are meaningful for Asians, will generalize to the occupational focus. Chang, Chi \nand Miao\u201fs (2007) study provides some evidence that this is so, at least for Taiwanese nurses. \nWe evaluate this further, testing the following hypothesis: \nHypothesis 1. The three-component model of occupational commitment (affective, \nnormative and continuance) generalizes to the PRC context. \nOutcomes of Commitment \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n6 \n \n Affective, normative and continuance commitment each involve a continuing sense of \nattachment to the occupation, the first motivated by an active desire to remain attached, the \nsecond by a sense of duty, and the third by a calculation of relative costs and benefits (Meyer \net al., 1993). Given that each involves an attachment to the occupation, albeit for different \nreasons, it is likely that all three will be negatively related to occupational withdrawal \ncognitions. Studies of occupational commitment with Western samples provide some \nevidence for this. Meyer et al. (1993), in their study of Canadian nurses found negative \nassociations between all three commitment dimensions and intent to leave the occupation. \nSnape and Redman (2003), studying HK human resource management specialists, found \nsignificant main effect negative associations with occupational withdrawal cognitions only \nfor affective and continuance commitment, although normative commitment was negatively \nassociated with occupational withdrawal cognitions amongst respondents with higher levels \nof continuance commitment. (This raises the possibility of interactions between commitment \ncomponents, which we discuss below.)  \nWhilst these arguments provide a basis for hypothesizing a negative association \nbetween withdrawal cognitions and all three commitment components, we may expect that \nthe relative strengths of these effects will differ. Affective commitment reflects a desire to act, \nand so is likely to involve a stronger attachment than either normative or continuance \ncommitment (Meyer & Herscovitch, 2001). Normative commitment is based on a sense of \nobligation, which can only be expected to last until the obligation is discharged in some way. \nContinuance commitment is based primarily on the costs of leaving, and this may be \nexpected to evaporate if a way of avoiding these costs or an opportunity with sufficiently \nattractive benefits can be found. The Western findings on occupational commitment are \nconsistent with this, with affective commitment having the strongest negative relationship \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n7 \n \nwith withdrawal cognitions and intent to leave the occupation (Meyer et al., 1993; Snape & \nRedman, 2003). Thus, we hypothesize as follows: \n Hypothesis 2. All three dimensions of occupational commitment will be negatively \nassociated with occupational withdrawal cognitions. This relationship will be strongest in the \ncase of affective commitment. \nProfessional activities such as attending professional meetings, participating in \nconferences, or serving as a professional committee member, are not usually defined as part \nof role requirements, and instead represent discretionary extra-role behaviors. As such, they \nshare the characteristics of organizational citizenship behaviors, being volitional and sensitive \nto individual attitudes (Organ, Podsakoff, & MacKenzie, 2006). This suggests that affective \ncommitment, reflecting an enthusiasm for the occupation, is likely to be positively associated \nwith high levels of participation in professional activities. Normative commitment may also \nbe associated with participation in professional activities, as a sense of obligation to the \noccupation is likely to be associated with a willingness to keep oneself involved and up to \ndate on developments in the profession. However, it is likely that the relationship between \ncommitment and intention to participate in professional activities will be stronger for \naffective than for normative commitment (Meyer & Herscovitch, 2001). Affective \ncommitment is likely to result in a broader sense of commitment, based on an active \nwillingness to be involved, whilst normative commitment is based on a sense of obligation or \nduty, which is less likely to be associated with enthusiastic and self-motivated participation in \ndiscretionary behaviors. Based on these arguments, we hypothesize as follows: \nHypothesis 3a. Affective and normative commitment will be positively associated \nwith the intention to participate in professional activities. This relationship will be stronger in \nthe case of affective commitment. \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n8 \n \nIt is anticipated that continuance commitment will not positively predict the intention \nto participate in these activities, since such a commitment will be associated only with those \nbehaviors that help to avoid the costs of leaving the occupation. There may even be a \nnegative relationship, since those individuals who feel themselves to be locked into the \noccupation by the costs of leaving may respond with resentment or a sense of helplessness, \nresulting in their doing no more than the essential minimum (Meyer et al., 1993).  Thus:  \nHypothesis 3b. Continuance commitment will be negatively associated with the \nintention to participate in professional activities. \nCommitment and Culture \nAsian and Western cultures have different views of the individual\u201fs relationship with \nsociety, with far-reaching implications for attitudes and behaviors (e.g., Wasti, 2003). Asian \ncultures tend to emphasize the relatedness of individuals to each other and an interdependent \nview of the self, whilst Western cultures construe the self as an independent, autonomous and \nself contained entity (Markus & Kitayama, 1991). People influenced by an Asian culture see \nthe self as part of a set of social relationships. They are highly sensitive to the needs and \nfeelings of in-group members, and are likely to subordinate their own preferences to these \nand to seek to maintain in-group harmony (Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 1995; Wasti, \n2003). Thus, collectivist Chinese societies place greater emphasis on loyalty to the group and \non social obligations than do more individualistic Western societies (Hui and Tan, 1996).  \nGiven this emphasis on social obligations, and the fact that familial and cultural \nsocialization may be key antecedents of normative commitment (Wiener, 1982; Meyer & \nAllen, 1997), it is likely that normative commitment will be particularly salient in a \ncollectivist culture (Yao & Wang, 2006). On the other hand, in a culture characterized by \nhigh levels of individualism, individual preferences and goals are likely to be given a higher \npriority, and attitudes rather than norms will loom larger as an influence on behavioral \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n9 \n \nintentions (Bontempo & Rivero, 1992). Here, individuals\u201f affective attachments and \nconsiderations of individual costs and benefits, reflected in affective and continuance \ncommitment respectively, are likely to be more important than social norms or obligation in \nshaping behavioral intentions. These cross-cultural differences in the salience of normative \ninfluences are reflected in research on the theory of planned behavior, which suggests that \nsubjective norms are more significant amongst those from collectivist cultures, whilst \nattitudes are relatively more important predictors of behavior for those from individualist \ncultures (van Hooft, Born, Taris, & van der Flier, 2004; Song, Wanberg, Niu, & Xie, 2006). \nThere is also support for such cultural differences in Wasti\u201fs (2003) study of organizational \ncommitment, with normative commitment and social factors being weaker predictors of \nturnover intentions amongst individuals endorsing idiocentric (i.e., individualistic) values, \nand social factors being a stronger predictor of turnover intentions amongst individuals with \nallocentric (i.e., collectivist) values.   \nThese arguments suggest two sets of \u201ccultural\u201d hypotheses. First, we expect to see \ndifferences between the Chinese and British samples in the levels of commitment across the \nthree components, as follows:  \nHypothesis 4a. Normative commitment will be higher in the Chinese than in the \nBritish sample.  \nHypothesis 4b. Affective and continuance commitment will be higher in the British \nthan in the Chinese sample. \nSecond, we suggest diverging hypotheses on the outcomes of commitment: \nHypothesis 5a. In the Chinese sample, normative commitment will have a stronger \neffect than affective and continuance commitment on occupational withdrawal cognitions and \nintention to participate in professional activities.  \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n10 \n \nHypothesis 5b. In the British sample, affective and continuance commitment will \nhave a stronger effect than normative commitment on occupational withdrawal cognitions \nand intention to participate in professional activities. \nInteraction Effects \nIt has been suggested that the three commitment components may interact in \ndetermining withdrawal cognitions and behaviors, in that high commitment on just one \ncomponent may be sufficient to produce a strong attachment, so that an incremental increase \nin either of the other two components will tend to have a lesser effect (Meyer & Herscovitch, \n2001). Significant interaction effects between components have been found in Western \nstudies of organizational commitment, for example between affective and continuance \ncommitment in predicting absence and intention to remain (Somers, 1995), and between \nnormative and continuance commitment in predicting turnover intentions (Jaros, 1997). In \ntheir studies of Chinese employees, Cheng and Stockdale (2003) found significant \ninteractions between normative and continuance commitment for job satisfaction and \nturnover intention, whilst Chen and Francesco (2003) found interactions between normative \nand affective commitment for in-role performance and organizational citizenship behaviors. \nFor occupational commitment, Snape and Redman (2003) found that normative and \ncontinuance commitment interacted in predicting occupational withdrawal cognitions. In all \nthese studies, the interaction was such that the relationship between one component and the \noutcome was stronger when commitment on the other component was low.  \nNormative commitment may be especially likely to play a moderating role in the \nChinese context, given its particular salience in such a culture (Cheng & Stockdale, 2003; \nChen & Francesco, 2003). However, there is a strong theoretical rationale for interactions \nbetween the commitment components regardless of culture, based on a \u201csufficiency\u201d \nargument, that commitment on one component alone may be sufficient to produce lower \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n11 \n \nwithdrawal cognitions, so that increments in commitment components will be associated with \nsmaller effects on withdrawal cognitions when commitment on one or other components are \nalready high (Meyer & Herscovitch, 2001). Consistent with this, interactions between \nnormative and other commitments have been found in both the Western and Chinese \nliteratures. Thus, we offer a general interaction hypothesis, undifferentiated by culture:  \nHypothesis 6. The three components of occupational commitment will interact in \npredicting occupational withdrawal cognitions, such that the relationships between individual \ncomponents of occupational commitment and withdrawal cognitions will be stronger when \ncommitment on other components is low.   \nMethod \nSample \nChinese sample. The Chinese sample comes from a study of members of the Chinese \nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants (CICPA) working in Beijing. CICPA is a \nprofessional association for accountants, people working in asset evaluation, and certified \npublic tax agents, working in the business and public sectors. In China, those with a tertiary \nor equivalent qualification can register with CICPA by accruing two years\u201f relevant work \nexperience after passing the qualifying examination. Previously, accountants were certified \naccording to experience and educational background, and most were retired accounting or \nfinancial officers of government agencies. This changed in 1995, when the Law of Certified \nPublic Accountants, promulgated in 1993, stipulated that qualification could only be achieved \nthrough examination. Nowadays, the career of a newly registered accountant normally begins \nas a salaried employee in an accounting firm. The career path is then to become a partner in \nan accounting firm or to join an enterprise as in-house accountant. Accountants are subject to \nCICPA\u201fs continuing education requirement, of 80 hours\u201f training organized by CICPA or \nequivalent activities in every two-year assessment cycle.   \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n12 \n \nEighty-two accountancy firms were randomly selected from a data bank compiled by \nthe Beijing Academy of Social Sciences. The management of each of these firms was \napproached, and 55 firms agreed to participate. A maximum of seven accountants were then \nrandomly selected from the staff list supplied by each firm. During May-June 2005, \nquestionnaires were distributed to 333 selected accountants. All completed the questionnaire, \nbut several responses were eliminated because of missing values on some variables, \nproviding an effective response rate of 86 percent. Of these 285 responses, 58 percent were \nfemale, 75 per cent were under 40 years old, and mean organizational and occupational \ntenure were 3.92 and 4.28 years respectively.  \nBritish sample. The British sample involved members of the Chartered Institute of \nManagement Accountants (CIMA), a professional association of management accountants \nand financial managers. This sample consists of accounting professionals working in \nindustry, commerce, and the not-for-profit and public sectors. Questionnaires were \ndistributed to 3000 individual CIMA members in Britain during March and April 2002, and \n812 questionnaires were returned. The response rate of 27 percent compares favorably with \nthose for accountants generally in Britain and for CIMA surveys in particular (Joseph, Turley, \nBurns, Lewis, Scarpens, & Southworth, 1996). The sample of 812 included 629 associates, \nthe main professional grade, and 170 fellows, with 4 unspecified, and was reduced to 788 \nbecause of missing values on some study variables. Slightly less than 38 percent were under \n40 years old, mean organization tenure was 9.20 years, and occupational tenure was 19.50 \nyears.  Seventy six percent were male.  \nComparing the two samples, the British sample had significantly longer occupational \ntenure, 19.50 years compared to 4.28 years for the Chinese sample (t = 40.73, df = 1070.26, p \n< .001). Organizational tenure was also significantly longer for the British sample (9.20 \nversus 3.92 years; t = 16.19, df = 1068.23, p < .001). The British sample was older; with age \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n13 \n \nmeasured in categories from 1 (under 25 years old) to 8 (over 55), means were 5.26 and 3.74 \nfor the British and Chinese samples respectively (t = 12.57, df = 1071, p < .001). Finally, the \nBritish sample had proportionately fewer females, 24 percent compared to 58 percent for the \nChinese sample (Chi-square = 106.94, df = 1, p < .001).  \nMeasures \nOccupational commitment was measured using the Meyer et al. (1993) scales, with \nsix items for each component. Since the scale was designed for use with nurses, we made \nminor changes to some of the items, for example replacing \u201enursing profession\u201f with \n\u201eaccountancy profession\u201f. One of the continuance commitment items, \u201eThere are no pressures \nto keep me from changing professions\u201f, had a standardized loading of only .218 and .288 in \nearlier studies of PRC lawyers in Guangzhou and Beijing respectively (Snape, Lo & Redman, \n2006), and had the lowest loading of any item in the Meyer et al. (1993) and Irving et al. \n(1997) studies. We decided to replace this item with another: \u201eFor me personally, the costs of \nleaving the accountancy profession would be far greater than the benefits\u201f. This is a less \nambiguous statement of the personal sacrifice notion which underlies continuance \ncommitment, and provided an acceptable loading on the continuance commitment construct \nin our subsequent analyses.  \nOccupational withdrawal cognitions were measured with three items, developed for \nthis study, for example: \u201eI frequently think of quitting the accountancy profession altogether\u201f. \nIntention to participate in professional activities was measured as the intention to participate \nin four specified activities. Participants responded on a seven-point scale from \u201enot at all \nlikely\u201f to \u201eextremely likely\u201f. The items were: \u201eAttend professional meetings organized by [the \nprofessional association]\u201f, \u201eParticipate in social activities organized by [the professional \nassociation]\u201f, \u201ePresent a paper at a conference or meeting organized by [the professional \nassociation]\u201f, and \u201eServe as a committee member of [the professional association]\u201f. These \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n14 \n \nitems were developed for this study. An exploratory factor analysis with oblique rotation was \nconducted for the PRC and British samples separately, each producing a single factor with an \neigenvalue greater than one, and accounting for 62.5 and 64.0 percent of variance in the PRC \nand British samples respectively.  \nHaving characterized participation in professional activities as extra-role behavior, it \nis possible that such behaviors will differ between China and the West (see Farh, Zhong and \nOrgan [2004] for a similar discussion of organizational citizenship behaviors). However, in \nassessing professional participation, we deliberately used generic items, so as to minimize the \neffect of particular institutional arrangements on our measure. In preparing our questionnaires, \nwe were careful to establish that professionals in each location found these items meaningful \nand felt able to respond to them.    \nWe conducted Harman\u201fs one-factor test (Podsakoff & Organ, 1986), to evaluate the \nsignificance of common method bias. We entered all attitudinal items in the measurement \nmodel into a principal components factor analysis. For the British sample, rather than finding \none dominant \u201cgeneral\u201d factor, we found five factors with eigenvalues greater than one, as \nanticipated, accounting for a combined 60 percent of variance, with no single factor \naccounting for more than 22 percent of variance. Similar findings emerged for the Chinese \nsample, with six factors having eigenvalues greater than one (the sixth factor was marginal at \n1.08), accounting for a combined 62 percent of variance, with no one factor accounting for \nmore than 23 percent of variance. In both samples, a varimax rotation revealed distinct \nfactors which were interpretable in terms of the anticipated measurement model. These \nfindings suggest that common method variance was not a serious problem in our data. \n Control variables were included in the regression analyses. Occupational tenure was \nmeasured in years, and gender was a dummy variable (1 = female; 0 = male). Age was \nmeasured as a categorical variable, ranging from 1 (under 25 years old) to 8 (over 55). Tenure, \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n15 \n \nage, and gender are generally used as controls in studies of the consequences of commitment \n(e.g., Chen et al., 2003; Cheng et al., 2003; Snape & Redman, 2003), because such \ndemographic factors may influence individual\u201fs in-role and extra-role behaviors (Chen et al., \n2003: 496). Since we are studying occupational commitment and occupation-specific \noutcomes, we choose to control for occupational rather than organizational tenure in our \nanalyses. We could not include education and job position as controls, because we did not \nhave exactly comparable measures for these variables across the two samples.  \n The questionnaire was developed in English and the British sample responded to this \nversion. We followed a back translation procedure, to produce an equivalent Chinese \nlanguage version. We also had two local researchers recommend any necessary modifications \nin the Chinese to accommodate local Beijing usage. Finally, we asked several Chinese \naccountants to complete the questionnaire and to comment on the clarity of individual \nquestions. A small number of relatively minor adjustments were made as a result of these two \nsteps. Chinese respondents completed this final Chinese-language version. All multi-item \nscales were calculated as unweighted averages of their measurement items. To test the \ninteraction hypotheses, the commitment scales were mean centered (Aiken & West, 1991).   \nResults \nThe dimensionality of commitment \nWe began by assessing the factor structure of the commitment model, estimating \nthree-, two- and single-factor models for the Chinese and British samples separately, with the \ntwo-factor model combining the affective and normative components. The results are shown \nin the first two sections of table 1. The hypothesized three-factor model was the best-fitting \nmodel in both samples, with large significant changes in \n2 \nand improvements in each of the \nfit indices (the comparative fit index [CFI] and nonnormed fit index [NNFI] increased by \nmore than 0.01 at each step) as we move through the nested sequence from 1-factor to 2- and \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n16 \n \n3- factor oblique models. We also tested a three-factor orthogonal model, in which the \ncommitment factors were not allowed to correlate. In both samples, this produced a \ndeterioration in fit relative to the three-factor oblique model, suggesting that the latter was \npreferable. The fit indices for the preferred three-factor oblique model were reasonably good \nfor the British sample, with the goodness of fit index (GFI) and CFI above .9, the NNFI just \nslightly below, and with a root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) below .08. For \nthe Chinese sample, the hypothesized three-factor oblique model again provided the best fit \nof those tested, although this time the indices fell a little short of the benchmarks for a good \nfit. In both the Chinese and British samples, all factor loadings were significant (p < .001), \nwith no standardized factor loadings below .4 and most rather higher. Overall, the oblique \nthree-factor model was the best-fitting model in both samples. \nMeasurement model and equivalence \nTo test for measurement equivalence across the two samples, we conducted a two-\ngroup analysis of the measurement model, with the three components of occupational \ncommitment, along with withdrawal cognitions and the intention to participate in professional \nactivities (see table 1, section c.). In comparing models, following van Hooft, Born, Taris, \nand van der Flier (2006), we focused on the CFI and NNFI, rather than the \n2\n difference test, \nwhich is subject to the same problems as the overall \n2\n test (e.g., Anderson & Gerbing, 1988).  \nWe began with an unconstrained model, with all estimated parameters allowed to vary \nfreely across the two groups. This provided a reasonable fit, and is shown as the \u201cfree \nparameters\u201d model in table 1. Second, we estimated a constrained \u201cfactor loadings equal\u201d \nmodel, which set factor loadings equal for the Chinese and British groups. The change in CFI \nand NNFI relative to the free parameters model were only 0.005 and less than 0.001 \nrespectively. Third, we tested for equality of factor variances across the two samples. This \n\u201cfactor loadings and variances equal\u201d model provided a change in CFI and NNFI relative to \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n17 \n \nthe free parameters model of 0.009 and 0.003. Finally, we constrained the factor covariances \nto be equal across the two groups, the \u201cfactor loadings, variances and covariances equal\u201d \nmodel, and the changes in CFI and NNFI were 0.013 and 0.004. In general, the changes in \nCFI and NNFI were smaller than the 0.01 which has been offered as an appropriate critical \nvalue when assessing measurement invariance across groups (van Hooft, et al., 2006; Cheung \n& Rensvold, 2002), the only exception being a slightly higher change in CFI, but not NNFI, \nat the last step. We conclude that the measurement model was not significantly different for \nthe British and Chinese samples, in terms of factor structure, loadings and variances, if not \ncovariances. This implies at least partial measurement equivalence and is consistent with \nhypothesis 1, suggesting that the three-component model of occupational commitment \ngeneralizes to the Chinese context.  \nSince some of our hypotheses concerned possible differences in structural parameters \nbetween the Chinese and British samples, we also conducted an analysis to test for invariance \nin these parameters (van Hooft, et al., 2006). We added structural paths from each of the \ncommitment dimensions to withdrawal cognitions and the intention to participate in \nprofessional activities. We compared an unconstrained model with these paths estimated \nfreely across the Chinese and British samples, and a constrained model with the paths set \nequal across the samples. The unconstrained model provided a reasonable fit (\n2\n = 2136.464; \ndf = 555; GFI = 0.860; CFI = 0.852; NNFI = 0.840; RMSEA = 0.052), as did the constrained \nmodel (\n2\n = 2152.588; df = 561 GFI = 0.859; CFI = 0.851; NNFI = 0.841; RMSEA = 0.051). \nThe changes in CFI and NNFI were very small, with no improvement in fit due to setting the \nstructural paths free. This suggests no significant difference in structural paths between the \nChinese and British samples, providing no support for the divergent cultural patterns \nsuggested by hypotheses 5a and 5b.  \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n18 \n \n Given the findings on equivalence in structural parameters, in is appropriate to test the \nremaining structural hypotheses in common for both samples. We therefore report results for \na pooling of the two samples. Table 2 shows the means, standard deviations, scale reliabilities \nand correlations for the study variables used to test our hypotheses on withdrawal cognitions \nand the intention to participate in professional activities. Scale reliabilities were acceptable, \nall exceeding .7.  \nWithdrawal cognitions and the intention to participate in professional activities \nIn table 3, we report regression analysis for occupational withdrawal cognitions and \nprofessional participation. We begin by testing hypothesis 2, which suggested that all three \ndimensions would be negatively associated with withdrawal cognitions, with affective \ncommitment having the strongest relationship. However, withdrawal cognitions were \nsignificantly associated with affective and continuance commitment, but not with normative \ncommitment. The relative importance of the commitment components was explored further \nthrough a usefulness analysis, presented in table 4. This shows the incremental contribution \nto explained variance by each component, over and above that explained by the control \nvariables and the other two components. This suggests that affective commitment accounted \nfor the greatest share of variance, as anticipated, followed by continuance commitment. \nThese findings provide partial support for hypothesis 2, the non-significance of normative \ncommitment being the only contrary finding. \nThe regression analysis suggested that both affective and normative commitment were \npositively associated, and continuance commitment negatively associated, with the intention \nto participate in professional activities (table 3). The usefulness analysis suggested that \nnormative commitment accounted for the greatest share of variance, followed by continuance \nand then by affective commitment (table 4). The positive association for both affective and \nnormative commitment is consistent with hypothesis 3a, although we had anticipated that the \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n19 \n \nrelationship would be stronger for affective, rather than normative commitment. Hence, we \nhave partial support for hypothesis 3a. Hypothesis 3b, which anticipated that continuance \ncommitment would be negatively associated with the intention to participate in professional \nactivities, was fully supported. \nThe Chinese sample had a significantly higher mean level of affective (British mean = \n5.18, Chinese mean = 5.46, t = 4.45, df = 583.52, p < .001) and, especially, of normative \ncommitment (British mean = 2.80, Chinese mean = 4.52, t = 24.78, df = 1071, p < .001), \nwhilst the British sample had a higher level of continuance commitment (British mean = 4.54, \nChinese mean = 3.99, t = 6.58, df = 570.35, p < .001). These sample differences were \nsignificant even after controlling for age, gender and occupational tenure. Thus, regression \nanalyses with affective, normative and continuance commitment as dependent variables \nprovided significant coefficients on a country dummy variable (Britain = 0, China = 1), \npositive for affective ( = .22, p < .001, R\n2 \n= .03, F\n \n= 28.12, p < .001, R\n2 \n= .04, and F = \n10.32, p < .001 for the addition of the country dummy) and normative commitment ( = .69, \np < .001, R\n2 \n= .26, F\n \n= 450.25, p < .001, R\n2 \n= .38, and F = 164.80, p < .001) and negative \nfor continuance commitment ( = -.10, p = .011, R\n2 \n= .01, F\n \n= 6.41, p = .011, R\n2 \n= .04, and \nF = 12.04, p < .001). The normative commitment finding confirms our hypothesis 4a on \nhigher mean normative commitment in the Chinese context. However, hypothesis 4b was \nonly partially supported, as only continuance (and not affective) commitment was higher in \nthe British sample. We have already rejected our other \u201ccultural\u201d hypothesis, hypothesis 5.  \nWe found partial support for hypothesis 6, with a significant two-way interaction \nbetween affective and continuance commitment for occupational withdrawal cognitions \n(table 3). We explored this further by examining the relationship between affective \ncommitment and occupational withdrawal cognitions at \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d levels of \ncontinuance commitment. This analysis was based on the procedures suggested by Aiken and \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n20 \n \nWest (1991), with one standard deviation above and below the mean representing \u201chigh\u201d and \n\u201clow\u201d commitment. We included the control variables, main commitment effects, and the \nsignificant interaction term in the analysis. With \u201clow\u201d continuance commitment, the simple \nslope of the affective commitment-withdrawal cognitions relationship was more steeply \nnegative (unstandardized slope = -.676; p < .001), than when continuance commitment was \nhigh (unstandardized slope = -.458; p < .001). This is consistent with our hypothesis, \nsuggesting that the negative relationship between the commitment dimension and withdrawal \ncognitions is stronger when commitment on the other dimension is low.  \nDiscussion \nOur findings provide support for the Meyer et al. (1993) three-component model of \noccupational commitment, in both Chinese and British samples. Fit indices demonstrated that \nthe hypothesized three-factor oblique model provided the best fit amongst alternatives. Our \nfit indices for this model were less favorable in the Chinese sample than in the British sample, \nbut they were comparable to those found in Asian studies of the three-component model of \norganizational commitment (e.g., Chen & Francesco, 2003; Cheng & Stockdale, 2003; Ko, et \nal., 1997), and to Chang, Chi and Miao\u201fs (2007) Taiwanese study of occupational \ncommitment. Although we conducted our correlation and regression analysis for the pooled \nChinese-British sample, for comparative purposes it is interesting to note that for our Chinese \nsample alone, we get a similar correlation between affective and normative commitment to \nthat found in other Asian studies. Our correlation in the Chinese sample is similar to the \nfindings for organizational commitment in Chen and Francesco\u201fs (2003) Chinese sample, \nsomewhat lower than in Ko et al.\u201fs (1997) Korean samples, and similar to that found in \nChang, Chi and Miao\u201fs (2007) study of occupational commitment. However, in spite of the \nsignificant correlation our CFA results suggest that affective and normative occupational \ncommitment were clearly differentiated.  \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n21 \n \nOur comparison of the two samples provided some evidence of measurement \nequivalence across the Chinese and British samples, providing support for the cross-cultural \nvalidity of the three-component model of occupational commitment. However, we found \nsome evidence of cultural differences in patterns of occupational commitment. Continuance \ncommitment was higher in the British sample, but our Chinese sample had higher levels of \nnormative and affective commitment. The findings on continuance and normative \ncommitment are as anticipated, but we had expected that affective commitment would be \nhigher in the British sample. Although contrary to our cultural hypothesis, higher affective as \nwell as normative commitment in the Chinese sample is consistent with earlier findings that \nthe affective and normative dimensions are positively correlated (e.g., Meyer & Allen, 1997). \nThis might be due to their having common antecedents in the form of \u201cpositive work \nexperiences\u201d (Meyer et al., 1993: 546). If Chinese professionals were more likely to perceive \ntheir work experiences as positive, this might help explain the comparative finding. It may \nalso be that the higher affective commitment in the Chinese sample reflects a culturally-\nconditioned tendency to identify strongly with the occupation as a collective in-group. We \ndid not systematically address the antecedents of commitment in this study, but this is an area \nwhere more cross-cultural research would be useful.    \nContrary to our expectations, the structural equivalence finding implies that the \ncommitment dimensions have similar relationships with withdrawal cognitions and \nprofessional participation in Britain and China, providing no support for our \u201ccultural\u201d \nhypotheses on the consequences of commitment. We do not have data on the cultural values \nof our two samples, but it may be that we are seeing the impact of cultural convergence. The \nrelative youth of our Chinese sample (75 per cent were under 40 years old) may help explain \nthis unexpected finding, since there is evidence that younger cohorts of Chinese managers are \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n22 \n \nless collectivist and more individualist than are previous generations (Ralston, Egri, Stewart, \nTerpstra & Yu, 1999).  \nOur pooled analysis suggested that both affective and continuance commitment were \nnegatively associated with occupational withdrawal cognitions, with only normative \ncommitment being non-significant. All three commitment components were significantly \nassociated with the intention to participate in professional activities: for affective and \nnormative commitment this was a positive association, whilst for continuance commitment \nthe association was negative, as expected. We had anticipated affective commitment having \nthe stronger association with intention to participate in professional activities, based on \nMeyer and Herscovitch\u201fs (2001) suggestion that affective commitment reflects an active \nwillingness to be involved, which is likely to be stronger than a commitment based purely on \na sense of obligation. In the event, normative commitment had the stronger influence, \nsuggesting that active participation in professional activities reflects a sense of obligation or \nduty, a feeling that one \u201cought to\u201d rather than a sense of \u201cwanting to\u201d participate. \nFurthermore, our findings suggest that this sense of professional obligation transcends \ncultural boundaries and applies in the West as well as in the East. This implies that regulators \nand professional associations seeking to encourage active participation in professional \nactivities would be advised to seek to build a sense of obligation, for example through careful \ninduction and socialization of members and by providing member services focused on \nsupport (Meyer & Allen, 1997). In addition, it may be that there is a need to build a habit of \nactive participation relatively early in the professional career, before high levels of \ncontinuance commitment begin to undermine the motivation to participate. \nPrevious research has suggested that the three components of organizational (Jaros, \n1997; Meyer & Herscovitch, 2001; Somers, 1995) and occupational commitment (Snape & \nRedman, 2003) interact in predicting outcomes. The logic of this is that high commitment on \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n23 \n \nany one component may itself produce a strong attachment, such that incremental increases in \nother components will have little additional effect (Meyer & Herscovitch, 2001). We found \none such two-way interaction effect, for occupational withdrawal cognitions, between \naffective and continuance commitment. In their study of UK human resource management \nspecialists, Snape and Redman (2003) found a similar interaction for occupational withdrawal \ncognitions. Their effect was similar to ours, but involved normative rather than affective \ncommitment. Why our findings differ in this way is not immediately obvious. It may be that \nthese findings are occupation specific. Research across a wider range of occupations would \nbe useful in examining such a possibility. \nThere are several limitations of the study which suggest useful areas for future \nresearch. First, our data were cross sectional and were collected from a single source. \nAlthough it is common in the literature to refer to withdrawal cognitions and extra-role \nbehaviors as the \u201cconsequences\u201d of commitment (e.g., Meyer & Allen, 1997), our cross \nsectional design means that we cannot draw firm conclusions about causation. Future studies \nmight usefully adopt a longitudinal design. In addition, common method bias is possible \nsince our data was collected from a single source. However, our assessment of the \nmeasurement model suggests that our questionnaire items measure distinct constructs, so that \ncommon method variance was not a serious problem in our data.   \nSecond, we have examined samples from two cultures and we have in effect assumed \nthat culture is a country-level variable (i.e., China versus Britain), rather than measuring \ncultural values at the individual level. Our primary interest was in comparing attitudinal \ndifferences and similarities between the two countries, rather than with testing specific \nhypotheses about the impact of individual-level differences in values. However, further \nstudies including samples from a wider range of cultures and testing individual-level \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n24 \n \nhypotheses would be useful, the former in assessing the generalizability of our findings \nacross national cultures, the latter in assessing the role of individual differences in values.   \nThird, our study was restricted to accountancy and our samples included accountants \nworking in a range of types of organizations and jobs, including public accountants, auditors \nand management accountants (the latter especially in the British sample, which was drawn \nfrom CIMA). It would be useful to conduct comparative cross-cultural studies for samples \nworking in exactly matched organizations and jobs, and also for other occupations, including \nthe traditional professions (e.g., lawyers), and also the emerging professions (e.g., nursing, \nparamedics, and other business occupations). Such studies would provide an indication of the \ndevelopment of occupational identities and attachments across countries. This would be \nparticularly interesting in the case of transitional economies such as China, where the \nemergence of professions as relatively autonomous and self-regulating occupational \ncommunities is likely to be an important feature of the economic and social development \nprocess.  \nThe great majority of the research on the three-component model of commitment has \nfocused on organizational commitment (Meyer & Allen, 1997). Whilst there have been \nstudies applying the three-component model to occupational commitment (Meyer et al, 1993; \nIrving et al, 1997; Snape & Redman, 2003), there is a need for comparative studies of \noccupational commitment examining Asian samples. In this paper, we have addressed this \nneed, providing evidence on the dimensionality and consequences of occupational \ncommitment in a cross-cultural context. Our comparison of a Chinese and a British sample \ndemonstrates measurement and structural equivalence, providing support for the cross-\ncultural validity of the three-component model of occupational commitment. Taken along \nwith earlier research, our findings suggest that the Meyer and Allen (1997) three-component \nmodel generalizes from the organizational to the occupational focus as well as across cultures.    \nChinese and British Accountants \n \n25 \n \nReferences \nAiken, L.
