Studies of insurance fraud \nhave typically focussed upon identifying characteristics of fraudulent claims and \nclaimants, and this focus is apparent in the current wave of forensic and data-mining \ntechnologies for fraud detection.  An alternative, yet complementary, approach is to \nunderstand and then optimise existing practices in the detection of fraud. We report an \nethnographic study that explored the nature of fraud detection practices in two leading \ninsurance companies. The results of the study suggest that an occupational focus on \nthe practices of fraud detection can complement and enhance forensic and data-\nmining approaches to the detection of potentially fraudulent claims. \n \nInsurance fraud detection 3 \nHow the detection of insurance fraud succeeds and fails \n \nThe Association of British Insurers (ABI) suggests that fraudulent claims cost \nthe UK insurance industry over \u00a31 billion a year, representing a 30% increase over a \ntwo-year period to 2001 (ABI, 2001).  The complexity of the problem matches its \nmagnitude, and this complexity arises from a number of sources. Fraud is dynamic: \nwhen the industry uncovers one \u2018scam\u2019 (i.e., specific type of fraudulent activity) and \nputs up barriers to prevent its reoccurrence, another scam takes its place.  Motivations \nto commit fraud vary, from opportunistic individuals submitting a fraudulent claim as \na way of recovering their premium, perhaps encouraged by a shift in public attitudes \ntowards the perception of insurance fraud as a victimless crime, through to criminal \nnetworks that use fraud as a regular source of revenue generation. Moreover, the \nlegal, organisational and commercial constraints under which the insurance industry \noperates often impact negatively upon the success of existing fraud prevention, \ndetection and investigation practices. In this context, the insurance industry is actively \nseeking solutions, typically technological, that might address the increasing problem \nof fraud. \nIn this paper, we present an observational study of claims-handling practices \nin two major UK and multinational insurance companies. The study formed part of a \nlarger project to specify and develop technologies for tackling insurance fraud \n(Ormerod, Morley, Ball, Langley & Spencer, 2003). Empirical studies of insurance \nfraud have typically focussed upon identifying characteristics of fraudulent claims \nand claimants.  This focus is apparent in the current wave of forensic (see for example \nTrueman, 2003,) and data-mining techniques (\u201cHunter Production Information\u201d, n.d) \nbeing developed for fraud detection. Little empirical research has examined the roles \nInsurance fraud detection 4 \nthat employees of insurance companies play in fraud detection and investigation, or \nfactors that might limit the effectiveness of fraud prevention practices. The present \nresearch aimed to address this omission by adopting an ethnographic approach to \nobservation (e.g., Ball & Ormerod, 2000) in order to understand the cognitive, social \nand organisational contexts in which claims handling occurs.  \nEmploying an ethnographic approach complements the statistical, interview \nand questionnaire methods used in studies of fraud types and fraudster profiling by \nproviding a detailed, longitudinal and independent evaluation of issues and activities \nsurrounding how the industry deals with fraud.  Ethnographic studies enable the \nobservation and discursive evaluation of best- and worst- practice examples that the \nproponents of such practices may be unaware of, or which they may be unable or \nunwilling to report or evaluate without bias. In our study, we identified a number of \npractices and skills that existing industry processes fail to support properly, and in \nsome cases actively undervalue or ignore, but which we believe offer opportunities \nfor positive change.  We argue that technological developments for fighting fraud can \nonly be effective if used in tandem with processes and techniques that capitalise upon \nskills and knowledge held by staff at all levels of experience within the industry. \nIn the remainder of the paper, we overview what is known about the nature of \nfraud and of fraudsters, and discuss the relative strengths of traditional and new \napproaches to tackling fraud that capitalise upon such knowledge.  We then outline \nthe ethnographic method, and describe its use in a study of the motor insurance \ndepartments of two insurance companies. The observations focus upon three levels of \nactivity in fraud detection; contributions that individuals make, organisational issues, \nand technological factors. We conclude by evaluating the relative contributions to \ntackling fraud of a forensic approach, which focuses upon identifying and treating the \nInsurance fraud detection 5 \ncharacteristics of fraud types and fraudsters, and an occupational approach, which \nfocuses upon identifying and supporting all levels of expertise among the industry \nstaff charged with the task of handling claims. \n  \nUnderstanding the nature of fraud and of fraudsters \nThere are numerous ways that people commit fraud. Gill, Woolley, and Gill \n(1994) define fraud as \u201cknowingly making a fictitious claim, inflating a claim or \nadding extra items to a claim, or being in any way dishonest with the intention of \ngaining more that legitimate entitlement\u201d. The Crime and Fraud Prevention Bureau \nannual report (2000) cites four main types of fraud in motor insurance and their \nassociated levels of occurrence as; completely false claims (12%), deliberately \nmisrepresenting the circumstances of the claim (32%), inflated loss value (39%), \nclaiming from multiple insurers (3%), with 14% being attributable to other types of \nfraudulent claims. Yet there is disagreement within the industry as to the best working \ndefinition of insurance fraud (Doig et al. 1999). Some companies consider \nexaggerating a claim to constitute fraud, whilst others are more concerned with \nclasses of systematic fraudulent activity such as staged accidents, false documents and \nmisrepresentation of information at the proposal stage. The problem of defining what \nconstitutes fraud makes the task of tackling it more difficult because it is not clear at \nwhat level to focus anti-fraud measures. \nThere are also several types of fraudster, classified by Clarke (1989) as \u2018the \nopportunist\u2019, \u2018the amateur\u2019 and \u2018the professional\u2019. The opportunist takes advantage of \na genuine loss to commit fraud, for example, by claiming alongside genuine losses for \nitems not stolen in a burglary. The amateur may start by committing opportunistic \nfraud and then take a step further, for example, submitting a claim for items stolen in \nInsurance fraud detection 6 \na burglary that never took place. The professional, arguably the most serious type of \nfraudster, engages in systematic frauds both individually and in organised networks. \nResearch has also focussed on trying to understand why people commit fraud. \nPersonal circumstances and a resentment of insurance companies appear to be major \ndeterminants affecting a person\u2019s willingness to commit fraud (Gill et al., \n1994).Trying to distinguish a fraudster from a genuine claimant based upon personal \nand social characteristics alone is, however, problematic. Research categorising a \nsample of fraudulent claims has suggested that fraudsters show characteristics that \nmake them for the most part indistinguishable from the genuine claimant (Dodd, \n1998). The fact that professional fraudsters typically do not use genuine identities \ncompounds this difficulty. \nA large number of legal, commercial and organisational factors interact with \nthe different types of fraud and varying motivations of fraudsters. A legal agreement \nbetween insurer and insured is based on the notion of \u2018utmost good faith\u2019, meaning \nthat each party is legally obliged to reveal to the other any information that might \ninfluence the contract between them, even if it is not explicitly asked for. This \nagreement relies on trust and honesty on behalf of both parties. The competitive \nnature of the insurance industry means that it is very easy for clients to obtain a \npolicy, and there is little opportunity for validating information submitted to the \ninsurance company in order to check that both sides uphold utmost good faith.  \nCustomers judge companies on the perceived efficiency of their procedures, \nsuch that scrutiny of policy information or claims information might reflect badly on \ntheir customer service reputation. Consequently, companies are often reluctant to \nadmit the scale of fraud problems to their shareholders and policy-holders (Doig et al, \n1999).  Moreover, increasing consumer awareness (e.g., through consumer journalism \nInsurance fraud detection 7 \nprogrammes) means that one badly-handled claim can undo millions of pounds worth \nof advertising (Clarke, 1989). Fraud is also difficult to prove legally, and may incur \nfurther costs when police and legal teams are involved, without any financial outcome \nfor the company beyond the recovered claim. Consequently, insurance companies are \noften reluctant to prosecute offenders, and sometimes this means that fraudulent \nclaims end up being paid. It also means that there is little in the way of a deterrent for \npotential fraudsters beyond a failed claim  \n \nApproaches to detecting potential fraud and fraudsters \n Despite the problems inherent in dealing with fraud, fraudulent claims can be, \nand indeed are, detected.  Anecdotal reports from discussions with fraud managers at \nthe start of this project suggested that detection typically occurs through the discovery \nof anomalies or inconsistencies in the information surrounding the claim (e.g., when \nthe circumstances of the claim do not match the account given by the claimant), \nidentification of patterns of claiming behaviour (e.g., repeated claims for similar \nlosses), or recognition of inappropriate claimant characteristics (e.g., aggressive \nmanner, uncertainty and hesitance in supplying information).  Investigators, often \nbased in special units in larger companies, receive suspicious claims, and investigate \nthem further in an attempt to repudiate fraudulent claims. The process of investigation \ngenerally involves seeking further information, either from the claimant or from third \nparty sources, and building up a clear account of anomalies, inconsistencies in the \nclaim coupled with potential motives of the claimant. \nThe responsibility for detecting fraudulent claims in insurance companies rests \nheavily with staff at the front line of the claims handling process. Claims handlers are \noften inexperienced, with typical company lifetimes of less than one year, and they \nInsurance fraud detection 8 \noften lack sufficient or appropriate training in fraud detection (Doig, Jones & Wait, \n1999).  Anecdotal estimates (from discussions with fraud managers in the insurance \nindustry) of the rate at which fraudulent claims are detected are as low as 10%, \nsuggesting that large numbers of fraudulent cases remain undetected.  Specialist units \nand expert investigators rely upon others spotting suspect claims in the first place, and \nmust therefore be able to discriminate quickly between claims that carry a high level \nof fraud likelihood and false positives, that is, genuine claims that appeared \nsuspicious to an inexperienced staff member. \nIn order to increase the chances of detecting fraudulent claims by \ninexperienced staff, companies have traditionally provided claims handlers with lists \nof fraud indicators against which to check incoming claims.  Doig et al. (1999) report \ntwo insurance companies who admitted to using this type of approach to tackling \nfraud. A fraud indicator is a heuristic, based on company experience, which describes \na factor known to be indicative of potential fraud. Each company we have worked \nwith has their own set of indicators, though there is considerable overlap across \ncompany lists. Commercial confidentiality prevents publication of an exhaustive list \nof indicators. More importantly, companies do not want the public to have access to \nsuch information because the indicators would lose their predictive power if potential \nfraudsters became aware of them. However, we can illustrate the concept of fraud \nindicators with some widely known examples.  Some indicators check verifiable data. \nFor example, the date of vehicle registration can serve as an indicator of a staged \ntheft: modern expensive vehicles typically have high quality locks that would be \ndifficult to open by an opportunistic car thief.  Other indicators are more subjective.  \nFor example, a claimant who adopts an inappropriately nervous or aggressive manner \nin talking to a claims handler may indicate a potential fraudster.  A decision procedure \nInsurance fraud detection 9 \nmay accompany fraud indicators whereby claims that trigger a number of fraud \nindicators higher than a given threshold become targets for further investigation. \nThe fraud managers we spoke to revealed that within the industry the \nproblems with traditional fraud indicator are now widely recognised. As our examples \nillustrate, individual indicators are not predictive of fraud - thieves do steal thousands \nof newly registered vehicles from genuine claimants each year, and there are many \nreasons other than fraudulent behaviour as to why claimants might appear nervous or \naggressive. Logically, individual indicators are predictive of fraud only if \naccompanied by related indicators.  However, simply summing the number of \ntriggered indicators means that the interactivity between indicators is lost. \nConsequently, these approaches tend to generate large volumes of false positives, \nwhich clog up the investigations units of companies while impacting negatively on \ncustomer relations.  Moreover, lists of fraud indicators fail to reflect the dynamic \nnature of fraud. Arguably, the use of static fraud indicators makes it less easy to detect \nnew fraud variants than having no lists of indicators at all, since anomalies associated \nwith new fraud variants will not trigger old indicators. \nInsurance companies have taken further proactive steps to improve fraud \ndetection during the claims-handling process. For example, the industry has \ndeveloped several databases to assist in the detection of anomalous information at the \nclaims stage. Examples include the Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE), the \nMotor Insurance, Anti-Fraud and Theft Register (MIAFTR) and the Credit Insurance \nAnti-Fraud Register (CIAFR). The aim of these databases is threefold. First, they \nprovide a way of verifying the information supplied by claimants. Second, they allow \ncompanies to assess whether claimants have a history of suspicious or similar claims.  \nThird, they provide repositories for sharing information about claims histories across \nInsurance fraud detection 10 \ncompanies and with other parties. Some companies restrict the use of specialist \ndatabases such as these to specialist investigators, while other companies have \nattempted to introduce their use into the front-line of claims handling.   \nLike indicator approaches, database systems present problems for the \ndetection of fraud. In particular, the quality of data held within such databases can be \nvariable.   Fraud managers report that data entry is often done over the telephone, or \nbased on information supplied by the client, and will often be done independently and \nrepetitively for each transaction that the same customer has with a company. There \nare therefore many opportunities to introduce noise into record sets, such as \nmisspellings, missing items, duplicate data, and outdated information. Consequently, \nsearching database systems can lead to problems, both with the failure to find \nexpected records, and the generation of false positives through erroneous matches. \nAttempts at understanding insurance fraud have focused primarily on \nunderstanding the characteristics of frauds (Clarke, 1989, 1990; Dodd, 1998; Doig et \nal., 1999), and relied heavily on potentially inadequate methodologies such as \nsampling of fraudulent claims, interviews and surveys. Litton (1998) argues that this \nresearch should be treated with scepticism because it is typically sparse and often \nanecdotal. Despite this cautionary note, recent technologies and processes have tried \nto address some of the problems inherent in inexperienced staff and noise in databases \nby using advanced intelligent software coupled with a detailed understanding of the \nnature of fraud and fraudsters.  One approach is to capitalise upon existing databases \nwhile overcoming problems of noise in the data using data-mining (see Dunham, \n2003 for an introduction to the data-mining approach).  Data mining techniques can \ndetect anomalies between client-supplied data and existing datasets while remaining \nsensitive to minor mismatches that are likely to generate false positives, and allow the \nInsurance fraud detection 11 \ndetection of patterns of fraudulent activity (e.g., patterns of repeated claim activity) \namong complex data sets. The software program Hunter (\u201cHunter Product \nInformation\u201d, n.d) is an example of this type of technique.     \nOther new technologies draw upon profiling approaches used in criminology \nand forensic investigations, borrowing techniques such as cognitive interviewing \n(Trueman, 2003) and voice stress analysis (Hovarth, 1982). Recent media reports \npoint to insurance companies beginning to publicly admit that they are using this type \nof technology in their bid to tackle fraud (c.f Steed, 2003). These approaches identify \nclients who display characteristics associated with fraudsters. There are also \napproaches that combine profiling, data-search and fraud indicators, (see \n\u201cFraudscope- What is it? n.d) \nThese technological approaches show promise but are largely unproven.  One \nconcern is that the current wave of technological and process fixes seems to have been \ndeveloped without a full understanding of their users, that is, the claims handling and \ninvestigation staff within the insurance industry. The systems focus upon detecting \nanomalies, the corollary being that claims handling staff are not themselves good at \nspotting anomalies in claims data. Yet, as we report in the study described below, this \nassumption is incorrect.  It is now widely recognised in other domains of human \ninteraction with computing technology that a detailed understanding of the needs, \ncompetencies, frailties and expertise of the target users of systems is an essential part \nof design (e.g., Schneiderman, 1998).   Thus, we set out to extend our knowledge of \ninsurance fraud beyond a forensic focus upon the fraudster, focussing instead upon \nthe occupational characteristics of industry staff responsible for identifying fraud.  We \ntherefore undertook a comprehensive, in-depth programme of research to investigate \ncurrent practices in fraud detection.  \nInsurance fraud detection 12 \nThe study \nOur research adopted an ethnographic approach to empirical study, using \ntechniques such as interviewing, participant observation, non-participant observation, \nand practical hands-on experience, to develop a description of the process of fraud \ndetection as it occurs in the complex environment of insurance practice. The long-\nterm, situated, and intensive nature of ethnography facilitates an understanding of \nwhat people actually do, rather than simply engendering a report of what people think \nthey might do when questioned at interview (cf. Viller & Sommerville, 2000). Many \nresearchers support the use of ethnography to inform systems design, and have \ndemonstrated its benefits (e.g., Anderson, 1994; Ball & Ormerod, 2000a, 2000b; \nBentley, Hughes, Randall, Rodden, Sawyer, Shapiro & Sommerville, 1992; Forsythe, \n1995; Hughes, King, Rodden, & Andersen,1994; Hughes, O\u2019Brien, Rodden,  & \nRouncefield, 1997; Hughes,  Sommerville,  & Bentley, 1993; Suchman, 1987). \nEthnography lends itself to establishing a comprehensive picture of work \npractices and insights into how to best to support such behaviours by means of \ntechnology and changes to current processes. Unlike survey and interview techniques, \nwhich are geared primarily towards eliciting an individual\u2019s personal perspective on \ntheir work processes, ethnography renders visible the social complexities of work \nactivities, enabling the investigation of the use of technology as an actual feature of \nthis social process. For example, ethnographic techniques afford an understanding of \nhow, when and whether current anti-fraud measures are used by claims handlers and \ninvestigators, what behaviours are best supported by computational techniques, what \nactivities are best left to human intervention, and how to implement technological \nsupport systems with minimal disruption to effective practices that are currently in \nplace.  Using an ethnographic approach, we can also elicit from investigators detailed \nInsurance fraud detection 13 \nexpertise on how best to support fraud detection by less experienced claims handlers \nat the front end of the claims process.  Our research focussed on two leading \ninsurance companies. A detailed longitudinal ethnography was undertaken in \nCompany A. To extend the generality of our research findings, a follow-up study was \nundertaken in Company B.  \n \nMethod \nThe main ethnography consisted of observation and interaction in two different \ndepartments of Company A, a major multinational insurance company. The first \ndepartment had responsibility for claims pertaining to commercial vehicle policies. \nThe second department mirrored these responsibilities for personal vehicle policies. \nThe ethnography lasted for two months, and took place during regular working hours. \nDuring this period, the ethnographer sat with claims handlers, attended meetings and \ntraining courses, and observed work practices, on occasion asking questions about \nwork activity and encouraging staff to talk aloud whilst completing claims-handling \ntasks. Observations were interspersed with periods of field-note writing to ensure that \neach part of the day was sampled across the two-month period. Three types of data \nwere collected: first, audio recordings of conversations, think-aloud protocols and \ninterviews; second, field-notes made during the two months; and third, samples of \ndocuments collected to illustrate work practices.  \nThe ethnographer also spent one week observing the work practices of \nCompany B, another leading company that specialises in telephone sales of insurance \npolicies. The ethnographer spent much of this time in the personal motor insurance \nclaims department. Because of the short duration of the study at Company B, it was \nnot possible to sample departments across different times of the day or corroborate \nInsurance fraud detection 14 \nwith evidence information gained from conversations with staff. Subsequent \ndiscussions with staff confirmed, however, that the observations were typical of the \ncompany\u2019s work practices.  \n \nResults \nThe ethnographic research identified three key elements that impact upon the ability \nof a company to detect fraud: (1) organisational influences on the claims and fraud \nprocesses; (2) the role played by the individual within the claims and fraud processes; \nand (3) technological concerns pertaining to both the organisational and individual \nlevels of company-based activity. \n \nThe organisation \nCompany A had strong organisational goals that dictated the nature of their \nclaims procedure, specifically how the company approached the problem of fraud. \nThe ethnography identified three key issues concerning the organisational goals that \nimpacted upon fraud detection. These issues concern responsibility and incentives for \nfraud detection, case ownership and feedback on outcomes, and communication and \nintegration of fraud detection within regular claims handling activities.  \nCompany A placed a strong emphasis on achieving high customer service \nstandards by ensuring speedy and efficient throughput of claims. This is exemplified \nby the way in which the claims department was organised. Everything was focused \ntowards the attainment of these goals. For example, large screens above the telephone \noperatives indicated the number of available operators, how many calls were waiting \nand how many calls had been taken that day. Large white boards listed the team\u2019s \nperformance and dictated their targets and goals for the coming week. Staff had to be \nInsurance fraud detection 15 \nlogged onto the telephone system at all times and had to enter a code detailing the \nreason for logging off. To ensure speedy and efficient notification of a claim, the \ncompany employed several groups of claims handlers, based at various sites around \nthe UK, whose main responsibility was to record information about new claims. \nThese were referred to as the Notification of Loss teams (NOL). Another set of claims \nhandlers, the claims management group (CM), had the responsibility of ensuring \nspeedy and efficient claims settlement. \nThe company focussed considerable effort and resources on monitoring the \nquality and quantity of the work of the claims handlers in both NOL and CM groups. \nThis was the responsibility of the senior claims handlers and team leaders. They \nwould listen into conversations between clients and telephone-based claims handlers \nin NOL, monitoring the number of calls taken and the percentage of time logged onto \nthe phone systems. Those managing the claims further down the line at CM would \nalso be monitored for the number of claims they processed each day and the number \nof pieces of correspondence they successfully dealt with. A sample of all claims \nhandlers\u2019 files would be checked to ensure they had followed correct procedures. \nStaff success on these quality assurance procedures dictated their likelihood of \npersonal development within the company.  \nTackling fraud was not observed to be a company-wide organisational objective \nbut the company did have a fraud initiative in place. Two members of senior \nmanagement staff were responsible for delivering the company\u2019s fraud initiative.  In \nthe year prior to our study, they had implemented a procedure for identifying \nfraudulent claims in NOL and CM groups. Delivery of the fraud initiative procedure \nto the claims departments was accompanied by a half-day training session for staff in \neach group. This procedure involved the construction of a set of fraud indicators \nInsurance fraud detection 16 \ndeveloped in-house that reflected the company\u2019s knowledge about indicators of \npotentially suspect claims. For each new claim, the claims handlers in NOL \ncompleted a fraud indicator sheet. Designated claims handlers (hand picked by senior \nsite managers and the fraud team) acted as referral points for any claim demonstrating \na target number of fraud indicators. They referred suspect claims to a loss adjuster \n(usually a third-party company specialising in verifying claimant information and \nassessing the circumstances and costs of a claim) who carried out further \ninvestigations. A strength of the company\u2019s approach to tackling fraud was that it had \na formal mechanism in place at the very front end of the claims process where fraud is \nmost likely to be identifiable. The company reported financial savings arising from \nwithdrawn and rejected claims since the inception of the new fraud initiative of the \norder of a 5 to 1 savings-to-cost ratio. In addition, the fraud initiative raised the \ngeneral awareness of fraud among claims handlers, thereby increasing the potential \nfor identifying suspicious claims \nDespite apparent gains, the implementation of the fraud initiative appeared to \nbe hindered by the key company objective of fast claims throughput. Emphasis on \nspeedy settlement was incongruent with the necessary delay incurred by a \nrequirement to investigate a claim. Thus, few suspect claims were referred for further \ninvestigation. Staff assessment criteria, in general, provided no incentive for fraud \ndetection: indeed, they appear to have acted as a disincentive. Achievement targets \nand quality assessment checks focussed the claims handlers\u2019 efforts on the quantity of \nclaims dealt with rather than on the specific features of an individual claim. Thus, \nclaims handlers demonstrated a reluctance to refer claims that fraud indicators had \nidentified as potentially suspect and would readily dismiss them by identifying \nadditional factors such as low vehicle value, low claim value, no previous claims with \nInsurance fraud detection 17 \nthe company, been insured with the company for a while which they felt negated the \nfraud indicators identified. The problem of achievement targets was compounded for \nstaff designated as referral points for fraud cases, whose performance assessment was \nadversely affected by other claims handlers referring suspect claims for them to \nexamine. These referral staff frequently complained that their role interfered with the \nkey objective of claims throughput and that they struggled to meet their targets.  \nA second limitation on the likelihood of NOL staff detecting and following-up \nsuspicious cases was the lack of ownership and feedback about cases; claims handlers \ndid not deal with a claim from notification through to decision. Thus, they rarely \nreceived feedback upon the outcome of a claim.  Ownership and feedback are vital for \nimproving people\u2019s fraud detection practices. Ownership influences claims handlers\u2019 \nknowledge of the detailed circumstances surrounding a claim, affecting their ability to \ndetect inconsistencies and anomalies as further information is supplied. Feedback \nserves a key learning role, building up claims handlers\u2019 general knowledge about the \nnatures of genuine and fraudulent claims.  Moreover, feedback would allow staff to \nfind out reasons why suspect claims are sometimes paid (for example, due to lack of \nevidence), which in turn should make them more efficient in making choices about \nwhich cases to refer. \nLack of ownership reflects the fast throughput of claims. New correspondence \nsurrounding a claim was allocated in the NOL group to the next available claims \nhandler. This meant that the claims handlers had little time to familiarize themselves \nwith a claim, typically giving little more than a cursory glance to the details \nsurrounding the incident. In contrast, CM staff demonstrated some degree of claim \nownership and hence it was a much better environment in which to ensure suspect \nclaims are spotted. For example, CM staff typically had more in-depth knowledge of \nInsurance fraud detection 18 \nindividual claims than NOL staff, and often recalled claim details from memory to the \nethnographer. However, CM staff worked in teams, each team dealing with claims \nbased on an alphabetical split around claimant surnames. Frequent changes in team \nmembership meant that claim allocations were reshuffled across teams. This reduced \nfamiliarity with claims and disrupted ownership of claims. The company had no \nformal mechanism to ensure feedback to staff about cases they had referred. In \ndiscussions with the researcher, staff often recalled suspicious cases but had no \nknowledge of the case outcome since the case had passed to a new team before a \ndecision to pay or refer the claim for specialist investigation.   Claims handlers \nappeared resigned to the fact that nothing would come of suspicions that they referred \nfor further investigation. It seems likely, then, that feedback and ownership might also \nsustain staff motivation to detect and report fraud. \nA third issue concerns the integration of fraud detection and investigation \nprocesses with the company\u2019s general claims handling procedures.  NOL staff worked \nfrom scripts to elicit claims information systematically from clients, but the scripts did \nnot contain questions necessary to elicit information that might identify fraudulent \nclaims. The requirement to remain logged onto the telephone systems and the need to \nmove swiftly onto the next call meant that NOL staff often completed checklists of \nfraud indicators some time after a call was taken. Databases recording the insured\u2019s \nclaims history might yield some information, but other critical information cannot be \nidentified once a call has ended.   Furthermore, to ensure swift claims settlement (e.g., \non receipt of a solicitor\u2019s letter from a third party involved in an accident), claims \nhandlers were often required to begin processing claims before they gained sufficient \ninformation to assess claims against fraud indicators. For example, a claim\u2019s handler \nwas observed completing a fraud indicator sheet based on a badly copied fax whilst \nInsurance fraud detection 19 \nanother was observed completing a sheet based on only a letter from a third party \nexpressing that they had been involved in an accident with an insured.  Frequently, \nclaims were reported by insurance brokers acting on behalf of the insured and they \nonly had the information provided to them by the insured.  Often under these \ncircumstances, claims handlers had to make assumptions when completing the fraud \nindicator sheets. For example, an extract from the ethnography describes a claims \nhandler assuming that the insured had left his keys in his vehicle yet the claims \nhandler did not ask the insured about their keys.  \nThe procedure for using fraud indictors used by claims handlers was also \nproblematic. For example, whilst the fraud indicators focused claims handlers\u2019 \nattention on known fraud types, the checklist approach implicitly discouraged \nidentification of novel classes of suspicious claim that fell outside the scope of the \nfraud indicators. On two occasions, we observed claims handlers who did not refer \nclaims because they were unable to find reasons for referring a claim based on the \nfraud indicators, despite the case being clearly suspicious for additional reasons. For \nexample, a claims handler had concerns that an insured had not disclosed a driving \nconviction at policy inception but did not refer the claim as it only had one fraud \nindicator.  \nDuring our observations of the NOL group, no suspicious claims were identified \npurely by applying the fraud indicator checklist. In part, the problem stemmed from \nthe fact that completing the fraud indicator checklist was implemented as a single step \nin the claims handling process: fraud indicator sheets were not updated when \nsubsequent claim details came to light. Moreover, the company did not analyse the \npredictive ability of specific indicators to highlight fraud.  \nInsurance fraud detection 20 \nThe ethnography revealed that, where suspect cases do get spotted detected by \nCompany A, they often result from the actions of external agents. Several \nprofessional sources are involved in the claims handling process, such as loss \nadjusters, engineers, garages, and third party insurance brokers. Examples of external \nsources identifying suspect cases include engineers and garages reporting vehicle \ndamage as inconsistent with accident circumstances described by the claimant, \nreporting damage that must have occurred prior to accident because of rust on dents \nand so forth, and also reporting that the vehicle would have been un-roadworthy prior \nto the accident (e.g., because of a lack of brake fluid in the braking system). A further \nexample was of an insurance broker telephoning the CM group to report he was \nconcerned that his client had lapsed payment on several insurance policies. \nSubsequent investigation of this client led to the discovery of fraud.  \nA major difficulty concerning the involvement of external agents was \ninadequate or inaccurate communication of claims information and suspicions \nbetween relevant parties. Loss adjusters frequently complained to us during the \nproject that claims handlers provided only sparse claims information and did not \ncommunicate their suspicions. Their problem is exemplified by the following extract \nfrom the ethnography, \u2018 a Loss adjuster rang to ask if the case had been referred due \nto the presence of fraud indicators or another reason and asked for driver details and a \ncopy of the claim form. The person wanted to know was there any reason it was being \ninvestigated only it was quite low value and she wanted to know if she was missing \nsomething.\u2019 Furthermore, we observed instances where claims handlers failed to act \nupon or document suspicions provided by external agents. For example, an engineer\u2019s \nreport was sent in to the insurance company suggesting suspicious behaviour by a \ngarage, there was also a note on an engineers report saying that there was a problem \nInsurance fraud detection 21 \nwith the insured\u2019s mobile number and some concerns over the validity of their \npurchase invoice. In both of these instances the claims handler failed to follow up \nthese concerns. Information from external sources affords a useful opportunity for \ninsurers to capitalize upon, by refining the processes and channels through which \ncommunications take place between claims handlers and external agents. \n \nThe role of the claims handler \nHandling claims within NOL was characterised within the company as a low-\nlevel job, essentially equivalent to that of a telephone receptionist, a job that was \nrepetitive, attracting low rates of pay and little training.  As a consequence, NOL had \nthe least experienced staff.  Arguably, however, NOL is the best position at which to \nspot potentially suspect claims, since it minimises the costs associated with \ninvestigation and allows questioning of clients prior to awareness that an investigation \nis in progress.  On average, NOL staff had less than a year\u2019s experience with \nCompany A, and many were unfamiliar with the insurance domain in general as well \nas in the specifics of fraudulent insurance activity. Young staff (often school leavers \non a gap year before university) lacked world knowledge about suspect information. \nFor example, many did not possess insurance policies, own a car, or know the value \nof pieces of furniture. Knowledge limitations are likely, therefore, to preclude the \ndetection of some classes of fraudulent claims such as financial exaggerations.   \n Claims handlers also appeared to operate under their own conception of fraud, \nwhich often did not correspond to the company view of fraud. Claims handlers readily \ndiscussed with our researcher suspicious cases that they had encountered, but they \ninvariably stated that they had never detected fraud and did not come across fraud in \ntheir day-to-day activities. This paradox seems to reflect the fact that these individuals \nInsurance fraud detection 22 \ntended to define fraud as being restricted to large, high profile, and probably court-\nproven cases involving significant sums of money rather than encompassing cases \nsuch as an individual exaggerating a modest claim. Some staff stated that fraud wasn\u2019t \nan aspect of their responsibility. Yet all of the claims handlers we interviewed \naccepted as their responsibility the company goal of making sure that the insured did \nnot profit from an insurance claim beyond the proper value of the claim. \nA common hypothesis in the insurance industry is that fraudsters are more \nlikely than genuine claimants to complain and be aggressive on the telephone. \nObservations of NOL and CM groups indicated that the attitude of the insured \naffected how a claims handler responded. If the insured was co-operative and \npersonable then claims handlers were likely to believe their story, perhaps even \nfeeling sorry for them and attempting to be additionally helpful. In contrast, when an \ninsured was aggressive or complaining, claims handlers were likely to see them as \nsuspicious and take steps to try to undermine their claim. For example, we observed a \nclaims handler conducting a search on the CUE database for details of the claimant\u2019s \ninsurance history, as an attempt to gather evidence to create a suspicion, solely \nbecause the claimant had been aggressive on the phone.   This finding has two \nimplications. First, if claimant\u2019s manner is a good predictor of the fraudster profile, \nthen claims handlers of all levels of experience already act upon it, suggesting that \nprofiling technologies that identify inappropriate manner in callers are effectively \nredundant.  Second, the relationship between the fraudster profile and aggressive \nmanner might be an illusory correlation, the claimant\u2019s attitude leading to greater \nvigilance and reactivity in the way the claims handler deals with the claim. \nOur observations identified a widespread aptitude among experienced claims \nhandling staff at spotting anomalies in claims information. For example, a claims \nInsurance fraud detection 23 \nhandler noticed that the insured had reported that both sets of car keys had been \nstolen, and yet they had returned a set of keys with the claim form as requested. Many \nanomalies were detected as a result of claims handlers\u2019 knowledge and dispositions, \nderiving from familiarity with similar claims or personal beliefs relevant to the claim. \nPrior knowledge and beliefs typically revealed themselves as assumptions about the \ncircumstances of the insured and the type of incident that took place. Our field notes \nrecord the following example, which we annotate (in bold) with apparent beliefs that \nunderlie the claims handlers\u2019 reasoning: \n\u2018A fairly inexperienced claims handler queries the personal-effects limit on \na commercial vehicle policy because this person has had a digital camera \nstolen from his car. An experienced claims handler replies that it is \u00a3250, \nbut then adds that there is a \u00a350 excess for a broken window (a belief-\nbased assumption that the camera was stolen because it was in view). \nThe inexperienced handler replies that there is no claim for a broken \nwindow because the camera was taken from the boot. The experienced \nclaims handler then replies that it is odd that a camera has been stolen from \nthe boot when there is no claim for any damage to his vehicle (evidence of \nan anomaly detection based on a belief that theft from the boot would \nnecessitate forced entry and subsequent damage). She notes down the \nneed to phone the broker and make further enquiries before the claim is \nauthorised.\u2019  \nThis example illustrates the essentially opportunistic manner in which claims \nhandlers detect anomalies. In this example, the inexperienced claims handler made an \nenquiry about the personal-effects limit that led the experienced claims handler to \nidentify an anomaly. Further evidence of opportunistic detection of anomalies comes \nInsurance fraud detection 24 \nfrom observations of claims handlers, mainly those in the CM group, using their local \ngeographical knowledge to detect anomalies.   For example, one claims handler \nnoticed that a picture presented as evidence of the ownership of an allegedly stolen \nvehicle was taken in her own street, the vehicle being parked outside a house at which \ncriminals were known to operate. Another example concerned two claims handlers \ndiscussing a claim; one of the claims handlers happened to live in the locale of the \nrecovery area and observed that the vehicle was recovered close to the insured\u2019s \nhouse when it had been stolen many miles from that location. The influence of local \nknowledge is interesting to observe, as increasingly insurance companies de-\nregionalise their claims operations. For example, a claims handler in Cardiff could be \ndealing with a claim that occurred in Leeds. \nNotwithstanding evidence that claims handlers could identify anomalies, often \nthey did not register such anomalies as problematic or suspicious, and instead \ncontinued to process the claim on-screen or put the claim file back into filing. For \nexample, we observed a claims handler who was concerned that a claimant had sent in \na large set of documents at the point of notification of loss; the handler explained that \na claimant wouldn\u2019t normally know that the submission of such documents was \nrequired for the processing of their claim. Yet the handler failed to make any written \nnote or to raise any query about this observation, despite also finding a MIAFTR \nmatch for the car being a previous total loss.  This finding suggests that the focus of \nthe problems that the industry has in dealing with fraud may not be the detection of \nfraud per se, but in the absence of procedures to deal with the anomalies that staff \ndetect. \nThe ethnographer identified one team of claims handlers in the CM group that \nwas particularly good at spotting suspicious cases, and whose members were vigilant \nInsurance fraud detection 25 \nand thorough in dealing with claims. This team was responsible for dealing with \nclaims for classic and cherished car policies. The team as a whole was more aware of \nfraud and had considerably better memories for cases than teams in other motor \nsections. A number of factors may explain their increased awareness,. For example, \nthis members of this team received less telephone calls than individuals in other \ndepartments, and they spent considerably longer on each claim file than was typical in \nothers sections of the company. The team was also more cooperative when it came to \ndiscussing suspect cases and its members were generally more experienced in \ninsurance and had more personal knowledge about cars than those in other \ndepartments. This specialist team demonstrated the interactive nature of factors such \nas time, vigilance, cooperative fraud detection, and experience, and the key role that \nsuch factors can play in determining fraud-detection capabilities.  \nWe also observed inexperienced staff in the NOL group detecting anomalies, \nbut this occurred less often that with experienced CM staff. Inexperienced staff tended \nnot to possess what Clarke (1989) refers to as the \u201coccupational hazard\u201d of suspicion \n(p5). Instead, they tended to adopt what we refer to as a \u2018framework of innocence\u2019 \nwhen interpreting claims information. That is, they treated claims as genuine from the \noutset.  Claims handlers in the CM group, on the other hand, were more likely to \noperate under a framework of suspicion, perhaps because they were often dealing \nwith follow-on information requested to clear up uncertainties in the initial report of \nloss.  Although a framework of innocence might hinder anomaly spotting, it is \nappropriate in that the majority of claims are genuine. In this sense, inexperience \namong NOL staff prevents unnecessary scrutiny of genuine claims, thereby reducing \nupset to genuine claimants. In our view, the adoption of differing frameworks for \nevaluating claims information at different stages of claims processing is an important \nInsurance fraud detection 26 \npart of a successful process for tackling fraud, since one must balance the benefits of \ndetection against the costs of false positives.  It is interesting, therefore, to see how, in \nassigning staff of different levels of experience to different stages in the process, the \ncompany implicitly embodied this shift in framework. \n \nTechnological issues \nThe fraud process relies heavily on accurate and comprehensive \ncommunication of claims information and suspicions, especially in situations where \nthere is no case ownership. The claims-processing software used by NOL and CM \ngroups was old and inflexible. They used two different systems, HUON was a claims \nmanagement system designed for use on personal motor insurance claims whilst I90 \nwas a similar system designed for use on commercial motor insurance claims. Both \nsystems were effectively repositories for claims information, allowing documentation \nof all actions, communications and correspondence surrounding a claim. The marked \ndifference between these two systems was the extent to which we observed evidence \nof claims handlers documenting anomalies. Extensive observations of staff processing \nclaims using both types of system revealed no documentation of anomalies in HUON \nwhilst we observed several instances of anomaly recording in I90. This discrepancy \narose because of differences in the way claims handlers could add notes to each \nsystem. I90 had a single notes field, so claims handlers could see notes entered by \nthemselves alongside those entered by others. In HUON, each note entailed a discrete \nentry, with only the first line of previous notes on-screen. The claims handler had to \ncheck a box next to any note to read it. From a fraud perspective, these notes play a \nvital role in communication between claims handlers.  Requiring users to skim \nInsurance fraud detection 27 \nthrough all the notes before adding their own, as in I90, helped to ensure that \nanomalies were monitored, augmented and that new ones added.  \n During the ethnographic study, the fraud unit in Company A provided some \nCM staff with access to the CUE and MIAFTR databases as a proactive move in \ntackling fraud. However, lack of training and backup support meant that CM staff \noften used ineffective search strategies when using these databases. CM staff tended \nto enter information in all available fields when constructing database queries. \nHowever, entering data in all search fields reduces the likelihood of a data match \noccurring. Experienced investigators tended to search using only a small subset of \nfields to maximise their search effectiveness, even when additional information was \navailable.  Claims handlers also struggled to interpret the information obtained from \nthese databases, often interpreting a match returned from a query as identifying a \nfraudster. Information supplied by these databases, however, can only reveal the \nprevious claims history of people. The data they reveal require careful interpretation, \nespecially in the light of the many false positives generated by data entry errors.   \n  \nComparison with Company B \n Company B has a strong customer-service focus that again seemed to be \ndetrimental to its fraud-detection capabilities. Like Company A, the company \nemphasis on being proactive in claims handling, staff targets based on quantity and \ncall performance,   and lack of incentive for detecting fraud, inhibited fraud detection. \nUnlike Company A, Claims handlers were, in theory, assigned to monitor individual \nclaims throughout its progress, offering some degree of case ownership.  However, in \npractise senior staff typically encouraged the claims handlers to circumvent the \nprocess and try to deal with a customer\u2019s query themselves, thus offering speedy \nInsurance fraud detection 28 \nassistance rather than incurring processing delays that would arise from referring \nclaims to assigned advisors.   \n There was no systematic fraud detection process in place in the claims \ndepartment of Company B.   However, a number of experienced staff was responsible \nfor dealing with, and advising upon, suspicious claims identified by claims handlers. \nThese staff had been selected because they had shown an interest in fraud detection. \nTheir role was to act as a referral point for fraud issues arising from the claims \ndepartment. These representatives then fed this information to the fraud department; a \nteam of five in-house fraud investigators. These investigators were relatively young \nand had on average one year\u2019s fraud experience. Two of them had been recently \npromoted from the claims department. This formal process of referral of suspicions \npromoted the documentation and communication of suspicions. However, the process \nrelied heavily on claims handlers reporting suspect cases, which they were often \nreluctant to do for the reasons described above.  \n The company focused its fraud-detection efforts in the fraud department. Here \nall new policies and claims were checked against databases of fraudsters and an in-\nhouse database of fraud intelligence was maintained. This process appeared effective \nat spotting anomalies and patterns in claims data.  However, investigators often failed \nto interpret anomalies and patterns as being potentially suspicious. Nevertheless, we \nobserved the process identify several fraudulent cases.  \nAs in Company A, many suspect cases in Company B were associated with \nanomalies reported by external agents. We observed only one example of a claims \nhandler identifying a suspect case, when they recognised a forged MOT certificate. In \nthis case, Company B provided feedback to the claims handler about the outcome of \ntheir suspicions. A fraud investigator confirmed that the MOT was indeed forged and \nInsurance fraud detection 29 \nrang the claims handler to notify them of this outcome. Despite this example of \nfeedback, the fraud representatives in the claims department complained that they \nrarely received feedback on the outcomes of suspect cases.  \n The software technology used by Company B was more flexible in relation to \ndetecting fraud that that used by Company A, specifically in incorporating a useful \npreventative measure. The system allowed the marking of policies of potential or \nknown fraudsters to prevent policy renewal. However, this process relied on human \noperatives marking the policies. We observed one instance where the marking system \nwas overlooked: a policy had been voided in 1998, but no marker was placed on the \nsystem. In May 2002, the company cancelled another policy of the insured due to \nnon-payment, but again no marker was placed. In July 2002, the insured took out yet \nanother policy and three days later, they submitted a claim which Company B had to \nhonour.  Company B also employed other technologies such as CUE and MIAFTR \nand these were available for use solely by the fraud investigators. During the period of \nobservation, however, none of the fraud investigators used these databases.  \nIn summary, both companies had strong organisational objectives that \nappeared incongruent with the process of fraud detection. The noticeable difference \nbetween companies was in the fraud processes that were employed. Company B had a \nmore high profile fraud initiative within the organisation but it was barely visible in \nthe claims department. Company A, in contrast, had a formal fraud detection \nmechanism in place at the front end of the claims process. Company B also had taken \nsome preventative measures in the fight to tackle fraud, whilst Company A was more \nreactive to fraud and dealt with it when it arose. Despite these differences in work \npractices, both companies showed similar (low) levels of fraud detection and a heavy \nreliance on external sources of information and staff expertise.  \nInsurance fraud detection 30 \n \nDiscussion  \nThe ethnographic study of ongoing claims handling processes in two major \ncompanies that we report in this paper allows us to synthesise a detailed \nunderstanding of the limitations that exist on capabilities for detecting insurance \nfraud. Organisational factors such as high customer-service standards, speed, \nefficiency, proactivity, staff assessment and productivity targets all emerged as \nvariables that dominate the structure and efficacy of the claims and fraud processes \nadopted by companies. These factors cause an absence of training, feedback and case \nownership, which discourage staff from reporting fraudulent claims. Moreover, \nprocesses put in place to encourage fraud detection, by using procedures based around \nfraud indicators, may actively inhibit the detection of new classes of fraud.  Also, old \nand inflexible software systems were shown to be detrimental to fraud detection, in \nfailing to support either the elicitation of relevant information or the documentation \nand communication of suspicions. \nSome of our observations seem to confound assumptions implicit in the \ndevelopment of novel forensic and data mining technologies.  Our observations \nsuggest that claims handlers are adept at detecting novel anomalies, and are quite \ncapable of responding when the manner of a claimant is inappropriate.  This raises the \nquestion as to whether new technologies that aim to detect more anomalies and \nrecognise fraudster characteristics from interviews and speech profiling are \naddressing the right target.  Staff appeared capable at identifying anomalies, but \nlacked the organisational processes and technological support systems to develop \nanomalies into testable suspicions. It was additionally observed that these \nInsurance fraud detection 31 \ntechnologies would be redundant in companies were paper claim forms and broker \nclaims reporting were prevalent.  \nNone of the companies we observed currently employed any forensic \ntechniques for claims handling staff. One of the companies did, however, use a data-\nmining tool in its investigative department. The ethnographer observed staff using this \nequipment for several days and sifting through thousands of matched data items. \nHowever, only 25 matched items appeared to be suspect by initial inspection by the \ninvestigator and of those only one was eventually considered to be suspicious enough \nfor further investigation. The ethnographer concluded that there was considerable \nredundant information in matched data items and that the interpretation of matched \ndata items as suspicious or not required considerable fraud knowledge.  \nIn terms of future developments, it would appear difficult for companies to \nchange rapidly either their technological systems or their organisational objectives. \nWe propose, however, that identifying how organisational and technological factors \ncan affect fraud detection can serve to facilitate a better understanding of how to \nimplement fraud-detection practices into revised claims procedures. For example, the \nworkings of the specialist team in Company A offer a useful insight into how to \nimprove fraud-detection methods. Providing staff with some incentive for fraud is \nalso going to be very helpful in motivating staff to be more vigilant.  \nThis research highlights some negative aspects of current fraud-detection \npractices, but indicates important opportunities to build on. With increased training \nand organisational support and through the introduction of appropriate supporting \nsoftware technology, companies can improve their fraud-detection capabilities. We \noffer four main recommendations to achieve these aims: \nInsurance fraud detection 32 \n1. To offer incentives and remove disincentives to staff in detecting and \nreporting anomalies. For example, call rate measures might be adjusted to \ntake into account anomaly detection and documentation.  \n2. To develop software and processes that support the documentation and \ncommunication of anomalies identified by claims handlers and by external \nagents, to enable insurance companies to capitalise upon the natural skill \nthat all people seem to have in detecting anomalies.  For example, \nsoftware systems could be developed using web-based interfaces that \nfacilitate the sharing of case notes across multiple sites.  \n3. To provide feedback on case outcomes to all staff involved in the handling \nof a fraudulent case, and to use this feedback to refine the fraud indicators \ngiven to staff. \n4. To develop organisational processes that properly integrate fraud detection \nmethods with general claims handling, particularly recognising that fraud \ndetection needs to occur iteratively throughout the claims processing \ncycle. At present fraud screening takes place only when the initial claims \ninformation is first given to the claims handler.  \nAnother aspect of the current research project has been to develop software \ntechnologies that implement these recommendations. This research is discussed \nfurther in Ormerod et al. (2003). We have also conducted a subsequent ethnographic \nstudy that focuses upon on expert fraud investigators dealing with claims that have \nbeen detected. The software systems we have developed mirror the kinds of expert \ncognitive processes used by fraud investigators to develop their suspicions, and push \nthese processes towards less experienced staff.  \nInsurance fraud detection 33 \nA key distinction between our research and the approach taken by other \nresearchers is our focus upon occupational rather than forensic studies of the fraud \ndomain.  We believe this research to be both timely and important; a clear applied \nbenefit relates to the potential for this research to provide the insurance industry with \na better understanding of the requirements of claims handling staff in terms of areas \nthat need support through training, organisational and process changes, and software \ndevelopment. \nInsurance fraud detection 34 \nReferences \nAssociation of British Insurers (2001).
