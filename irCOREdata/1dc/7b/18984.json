Hyper-\ntensive disorders in pregnancy consist of a group of\ndisorders that include pre-eclampsia, latent or chronic\nessential hypertension, a variety of renal diseases, and\ntransient (gestational) hypertension. The definitions used\nto distinguish these disorders differ, leading to uncer-\ntainty about their prevalence, natural history and\nresponse to treatment. Pre eclampsia is associated with\nseveral complications[2] and remains one of the largest\nsingle cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbid-\nPublished: 11 August 2008\nBMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2008, 8:38 doi:10.1186\/1471-2393-8-38\nReceived: 27 March 2008\nAccepted: 11 August 2008\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2393\/8\/38\n\u00a9 2008 Thangaratinam et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2008, 8:38 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2393\/8\/38ity[3,4]. They have been reported to account for 14% of\ndirect maternal deaths and 18% of fetal or infant\ndeaths[3,4].\nOnce the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia is established, timely\nmanagement is of the essence to avoid or minimise mor-\ntality and morbidity. Clinical prediction of disease com-\nplications using a combination of patients' characteristics,\nsymptoms, physical signs and investigations all of which\nwe consider tests, forms the basis of clinical care in these\nsituations[5]. Therefore, there is a need for guidance\nregarding the best testing strategies with which to predict\nthe development of complications in pre-eclampsia. As\nwell as allowing clinicians to avoid unnecessary interven-\ntions in low risk groups, this would allow high-risk groups\nto benefit from monitoring of disease severity, use of anti-\nhypertensive therapy, administration of anticonvulsants,\nand antenatal corticosteroids[6,7].\nMethods\nA systematic quantitative overview of studies of complica-\ntions of pre-eclampsia will be conducted to obtain sum-\nmary estimates of accuracy of all available tests.\nThe proposed methodology is in line with the guidance of\nthe NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination[8] and\nthat of the Cochrane Methods Working Group on Screen-\ning and Diagnostic tests[9]. The investigation will be car-\nried out in the following recommended steps: (i)\nQuestion formulation, (ii) Study selection and identifica-\ntion, (iii) Study quality assessment, (iv) Data extraction\nand (v) Data synthesis. Our strategy for each of these steps\nwill be based on a prospective protocol, which is outlined\nbelow:\nQuestion formulation\nThe tests to be considered by the review are specified in\nthe form of structured questions in Table 1. We have gen-\nerated a priority list based on importance to clinical prac-\ntice using a modified Delphi survey.[10] An exhaustive list\nof the tests and outcomes in the prediction of pre eclamp-\nsia were sent to experts in the field. Each one of the issues\nwere rated according to their importance to clinical prac-\ntice and ranked accordingly. The review will focus on the\nprioritised tests obtained from the survey.\nStudy identification and selection\nWe have a thorough search protocol by which literature is\nidentified via general bibliographic databases including\nMEDLINE and EMBASE. Specialist computer databases\nlike DARE (Database Of Abstracts of Reviews of Effective-\nness), MEDION (a database of diagnostic test reviews set\nup by Dutch and Belgian researchers), the Cochrane\nLibrary and relevant specialist registers of the Cochrane\nCollaboration, particularly the Pregnancy and Child Birth\ngroup are searched. Individual experts and those with an\ninterest in this field will be contacted to uncover grey lit-\nerature. SciSearch will be used to identify frequently cited\nTable 1: Structured questions for systematic review of test accuracy studies\nQuestion Components Tests for predicting complications of pre eclampsia\nPopulation Pregnant women with pre eclampsia\nTests\nHistory Parity; Race; Maternal age; Previous severe pre eclampsia\/Eclampsia; Family history of pre eclampsia\/\neclampsia; Obesity; Weight gain; Pre existing hypertension, renal disease, diabetes, lupus, thrombophilia, \nother auto immune diseases; Multiple pregnancy; Symptoms-headache, epigastric pain, nausea, visual \ndisturbance or combination of symptoms\nExamination Blood pressure; Peripheral oedema; Exaggerated tendon reflexes; Clonus; Papilloedema; Retinal changes; \nOliguria; Symphysio fundal height; Oxygen saturation\nInvestigations Biochemical: Serum uric acid, urine dipstick (Bedside Urinalyses) 24 hour urine protein, urinary calcium \nexcretion, hypoalbuminaemia, microalbuminuria, fibronectin, protinuria, renal and liver function tests; \nUltrasound: Growth, liquor volume, Doppler (uterine, umbilical artery, Middle cerebral artery, venous, \nuteroplacental) Bio Physical Profile; Haematological: Anti thrombin III, platelet count, haemoglobin, \nfibrinogen, thrombophilia screen, Maternal serum Alpha feto protein(MSAFP), Serum Human Chorionic \nGonadotropin (HCG); Computerised Tomography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging\nOutcome Maternal\nEclampsia; Pulmonary oedema; Cerebral Haemorrhage; Hepatic, renal, haematological complications; \nCardiac arrest; Abruption; Thromboembolism; stroke; psychiatric problems; Complications of labour and \ndelivery; Maternal death; Need for hospitalisation, Day care unit visits, Use of intensive care, ventilation \nand dialysis\nFetal\nIntra uterine growth restriction; Pre maturity; Abnormal p H at birth or antenatal; Abnormal Apgar; \nHypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy; Perinatal death; Long term effect, learning disabilities, Developmental \nand special needs after discharge; Need for neonatal intensive care admission, mechanical ventilation and \nduration of hospital stay\nStudy design Systematic review of test accuracy studiesPage 2 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBM\nC\n \nP\nr\ne\ng\nn\na\nn\nc\ny\n \na\nn\nd\n \nC\nh\ni\nl\nd\nb\ni\nr\nt\nh\n \n2\n0\n0\n8\n,\n \n8\n:\n3\n8\nh\nt\nt\np\n:\n\/\n\/\nw\nw\nw\n.\nb\ni\no\nm\ne\nd\nc\ne\nn\nt\nr\na\nl\n.\nc\no\nm\n\/\n1\n4\n7\n1\n-\n2\n3\n9\n3\n\/\n8\n\/\n3\n8\nP\na\ng\ne\n \n3\n \no\nf\n \n7\n(\np\na\ng\ne\n \nn\nu\nm\nb\ne\nr\n \nn\no\nt\n \nf\no\nr\n \nc\ni\nt\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \np\nu\nr\np\no\ns\ne\ns\n)\nTable 2: Search term combinations for identification of studies predicting complications of pre eclampsia\nPopulation Test Outcome\nHistory Examination Investigation Final Refinement\n1. pre adj eclampsia\n2. preeclampsia\n3. hypertens $\n4. pregnan $\n5. pre-eclampsia #.DE.\n6. hypertension #.DE.\n7. pregnancy #.DE.\n8. 3 or 6 (hypertension)\n9. 4 OR 7 (pregnancy)\n10. 8 and 9 \n(pregnancy and hypertension)\n12. history\n13. parity\n14. multiparity or nulliparity\n15. matern$ near age\n16.

Our search\nterms and flow chart of search strategy are shown in Table\n2 and in Fig 1. An initial search in Medline yielded 11711\ncitations. The search strategy was adapted for searching in\nEmbase to obtain a total of 19500 citations.

All available reports, irrespective\nof language will be included to reduce bias[12]. Subse-\nquent final inclusion or exclusion decisions will be made\non examination of these manuscripts. In cases of dupli-\ncate publication, the most recent and complete versions\nwill be selected. Two reviewers will then independently\nselect the studies, which meet predefined and explicit cri-\nteria regarding population, tests, outcomes and study\ndesign (Table 1). These criteria will be piloted using a\nsample of papers and agreement between reviewers will\nbe measured. When disagreements occur, the two review-\ners will meet and if necessary the issue will be resolved by\nconsensus involving a third reviewer.\nStudy quality assessment\nA review of papers meeting the eligibility criteria will be\nconducted by the same reviewers who judged eligibility,\nbut this time rating the methodological quality of the pri-\nmary research. Methodological quality is a reflection of\nthe degree to which the study design, conduct and analysis\nhas minimised bias in addressing the research question.\nThis ensures a high level of internal validity (i.e. the\ndegree to which the results of an observation are correct\nfor the patients being studied). The potential sources of\nbias and variability arising from spectrum composition\nand other variations in test protocol or the use of reference\nstandard in individual studies will be considered when\ninterpreting the results[13]. In addition to using study\nquality as possible explanation for differences in results,\nthe extent to which primary research met methodological\nstandards is important per se for assessing the strength of\nany conclusions that are reached[8]. We will evaluate ele-\nments of study design which are likely to have a direct\nrelationship to bias and variability in a test accuracy study\n[13-19]. The criteria for study validation are shown in Fig\n2.\nCriteria for quality assessment to be used in the review of tests predicting complications of pre eclampsiaFigu e 2\nCriteria for quality assessment to be used in the review of tests predicting complications of pre eclampsia. \na) Generic quality items   \u00b7 Recruitment of subjects (consecutive or random sample)  \u00b7 Blinding of observers assessing the out-\ncome to the findings of the test  \u00b7 Verification of diagnosis by outcome in all tested cases  \u00b7 90% or more of enrolled population \nfollowed up    \nb) Specific quality items related to features of this project   Population  Description of spectrum composition   Test Adequate \ndescription of test and its measurements determining cut-off level for abnormality a priori  Outcome Complications of pre \neclampsia  \nStudy samp le\nTest positive Test negative\nOutcome \npresent\nTrue \nposit ive\nTest\nOutcome \nabsent\nFalse \nposit ive\nOutcome\nOutcome \nabsent\nTrue \nnegative\nOutcome \npresent\nFalse \nnegative\nThe populat ion\nA clinically appropriate \nconsecutive or random \nsample\nThe test\nMeasurement\nCut-off for abnormality\nOutcome\nThe Outcome\nAssessment  blind to test \nresult \nVerified fully in both test \npositive and test negative \ncases\nEstimation  of  test  accuracy\ne.g. likel ihood ratiosPage 5 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2008, 8:38 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2393\/8\/38Data extraction\nThe extraction of study findings will be conducted in\nduplicate using a pre-designed and piloted data extraction\nform to avoid any errors. Two authors will independently\nextract information from each article in order to construct\n2 \u00d7 2 tables of the diagnostic test result and outcomes. Any\ndisagreement will be resolved by consensus. Given the\nextent of insufficient reporting in the medical literature,\nwe propose to obtain missing information from investiga-\ntors whenever possible. It is otherwise impossible to dis-\ntinguish between what was done but not reported and\nwhat was not done. To avoid introducing bias, unpub-\nlished information will be obtained in writing, and will be\ncoded in the same fashion as published information with\nequal regard for inter-coder agreement. In addition to\nusing multiple coders to insure the reproducibility of the\noverview, sensitivity analyses around important or ques-\ntionable judgements regarding the inclusion or exclusion\nof studies, the validity assessments and data extraction\nwill be performed.\nData synthesis\nWe will explore causes of variation in results from study to\nstudy (heterogeneity), synthesise results from individual\nstudies (meta-analysis) if appropriate[8,15] and assess for\nthe risk of publication bias. Heterogeneity of results\nbetween studies will be graphically assessed looking at the\ndistribution of rates, sensitivities and specificities in the\nROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve and like-\nlihood ratios using Forest plots. To explore causes of het-\nerogeneity we will conduct a sensitivity analysis by\nsubgroups to see whether variations in population charac-\nteristics, tests, outcomes and study quality affect the esti-\nmate accuracy. Conclusions regarding the typical estimate\naccuracy will be interpreted cautiously if there is signifi-\ncant heterogeneity. Individual factors explaining hetero-\ngeneity will also be analysed using meta-regression to\ndetermine their unique contribution allowing for other\nfactors. We will conduct meta-analyses to generate sum-\nmary estimates of likelihood ratios (LRs), diagnostic odds\nratios (ratio of LRs) and area under receiver operating\ncharacteristic (ROC) curves as appropriate[15,20,21]\nThe risk of publication bias is expected to be high in\nreviews of test accuracy[22]. Analysis for assessing the risk\nof publication bias will be carried out by producing fun-\nnel plots of accuracy estimates against corresponding var-\niances. In the absence of publication bias it is to be\nexpected that the point estimates will fill a funnel shape in\nthe plot. Large gaps in the funnel indicate a group of pos-\nsible 'missing' publications. These omissions are due to\nsmall studies showing limited accuracy and are unlikely to\nbe missing at random. This phenomenon will also be sta-\ntistically evaluated using Egger's test [23].\nDiscussion\nIn the same way as systematic reviews of effectiveness of\ntreatments in Obstetrics have been pursued over the last\ndecade, research on test accuracy also needs systematic\nreviewing[14,24]. One of the questions remaining after\nestablishing effectiveness evidence for magnesium sul-\nphate, steroids and anti hypertensives is to identify those\nwho will benefit most from these interventions[25,26].\nRelying on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trials\nalone is not sufficient for determining who should and\nshouldn't get these treatments. Women at high risk of\ncomplications of pre-eclampsia are likely to benefit most\nwhilst in low risk women, therapy may cause more harm\nthan good. Therefore, what is required is the prediction of\nrisk of complications (such as eclampsia) of pre-eclamp-\nsia.\nInformation on women's risk stratification can be\nobtained from test accuracy reviews, which provide post\ntest probabilities for a clinical outcome targeted by treat-\nment. Integration of these with evidence for therapeutic\neffectiveness will enable generating estimates of Number\nNeeded to Treat (NNT). The lower the risk, the higher the\nNNT and the lower are our and women's expectation of\nbenefit from treatment. Conversely, the higher the base-\nline risk, the lower the NNT, the higher are our expecta-\ntion of benefit and the more inclined we would be to\nrecommend, and women to accept therapy[24,27]. This\nwill serve to rationalise clinical decision-making.\nThis project will collate and synthesise the available evi-\ndence regarding the value of the tests for predicting com-\nplications of pre-eclampsia. The systematic overviews will\nassess the quality of the available evidence and provide\nestimates of rate (or risk) of complications of pre-eclamp-\nsia given various patient characteristics and other find-\nings. It will identify a set of tests that have maximal\npredictive value to aid in therapeutic decision-making. An\nestimate of the magnitude of the benefits will be gauged\nby integration of the knowledge about risk with evidence\nof therapeutic effectiveness for various interventions. This\nwill help to formulate practice recommendations and spe-\ncific recommendations for future research.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nKSK conceived the idea of the review and developed the\nprotocol with KMKI, SO'B, FO'M, AC and ST.
