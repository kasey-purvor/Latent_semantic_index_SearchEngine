Drawing on some of the insights of \npositioning theory, it shows how \u2018Left\u2019 and \u2018Right\u2019 are discursive resources deployed, contested and \nresisted in political exchange. The article looks in depth at some of the political uses to which Left-Right \ntalk may be put, discussing in particular acts of partisan profiling, of legitimisation and subversion, and \nthe evocation or rejection of political continuity. The article argues that while these usages can be seen \nas tactical moves pursued for political advantage, they have a larger significance insofar as they indicate \none of the ways the democratically important imagery of Left and Right may remain active in \ncontemporary politics. \n  \n \n \n\u2018There\u2019s nothing right-wing about the BNP.\u2019 \nDaniel Hannan MEP (Conservative), The Telegraph, 22\nnd\n February 2009. \n \n \nIt is often when there is the suspicion something is in decline that scholars make it the topic \nof serious reflection.  Things whose vitality or appeal seemed self-evident come to be \nregarded as contingent things to be accounted for and perhaps defended or mourned.  What \nhas been true in recent years of a wide range of political phenomena, from the nation-state to \nactive citizenship and civil society, seems to have some pertinence also for the political \ncategories of Left and Right.  While still typically invoked for analytical purposes rather than \nas a distinctive object of study, Left and Right have been given detailed consideration in \nseveral works of the last two decades.  Almost all contributions have felt it necessary to \ndiscuss, though they have often disputed, the possibility that these categories are on the \nwane.\n2\n \nThe question of what lies in store for Left and Right points naturally to the more basic \nquestion of what exactly these terms are about, and here two major approaches can be \ndiscerned.  One approach \u2013 broadly political-philosophical \u2013 regards them as expressing \nquite stable traditions of political ideas.\n3\n  Theorists have laid out what they see as the \nenduring commitments of Left and Right, treating them either as largely self-standing \norientations or as dyads which derive their meaning from clashes of view on specific \n 2 \nconcerns.  Some such accounts treat the two traditions as rooted in divergent core values (e.g. \nequality and liberty, progress and stability); others regard them as rooted in differing \ninterpretations and weightings of the same values and concepts and differences concerning \nhow they are best served.  Common to these readings is the view that whatever variation in \nthe meaning of Left and Right may exist across time and space is less important than the core \nset of meanings which stays largely the same.  A second approach \u2013 broadly social-scientific \n\u2013 instead takes a strictly empiricist view on the question of continuity and variation, treating \nLeft and Right as flexible categories which mean roughly whatever a certain set of key actors \nor a statistically significant sample of a given population says that they mean.  Insofar as \nlong-standing patterns are identified, this approach is compatible with the first, although \noften these studies insist on the openness of such beliefs to cultural difference and temporal \nchange.\n4\n \nBoth these approaches to Left and Right aim to identify the semantic content of the \nterms, i.e. the traditions and conflicts they symbolise.  Their methods and conclusions may \ndiffer, but the probl\u00e9matique is much the same.  Both approaches are able to say interesting \nthings about the continuing or diminishing vitality of Left and Right as markers for political \ntraditions, be they universal or localised, and about the democratic implications of different \nreadings of the situation.   \nIn this article I do not wish to argue against the validity of these approaches and the \nquestions they raise, but instead to indicate how an understanding of Left and Right \naddressed exclusively to the ideas they do or do not index would be incomplete.  For there is \nanother dimension to their existence which concerns the way they are invoked and put to \nwork in political discourse.  \u2018Left\u2019 and \u2018Right\u2019 are discursive resources drawn upon, \ncontested and resisted in political exchange \u2013 themselves the site of conflict as much as an \nexogenous device for its representation.  When a Conservative MEP seeks to explain why the \nBritish National Party has, contrary to popular belief, little in common with the \u2018mainstream \nRight\u2019, or when certain partisans invoke for themselves the name of \u2018The Left Party\u2019, or \nindeed when others deny the enduring relevance of these categories, their actions are \nproperly seen not as a detached exercise in description but one with performative intent and \/ \nor political consequence.  To be sure, the possibility of engaging in such actions is largely \npredicated on Left and Right being seen to enjoy some level of stable semantic content (else \nthey would presumably lack prestige), but once this is true they take on a second life as \nresources with which actors can play.  Worthy of attention therefore are the purposes which \n 3 \ninform the adoption of \u2018Left\u2019 and \u2018Right\u2019 (and their correlate the \u2018Centre\u2019) in day-to-day \npolitics and the effects which are thereby achieved.   \nThis article outlines several dimensions of the categories\u2019 deployment in political \ndiscourse, drawing on the insights of positioning theory.\n5\n  It provides an actor-centred \naccount of the Left-Right idiom, addressed to the way political figures apply these terms for \npolitical gain in the context of public interaction.  This focus on the political usage of the \nLeft-Right vocabulary finds part of its justification in the deeper understanding it allows of \nthe idiom\u2019s political character.  To overlook its pragmatic application would be to neglect \none dimension of its existence.  Perhaps the key significance of a focus on Left and Right as \nresources lies however in what it implies for the durability of a potentially valuable political \nvocabulary.  It is sometimes suggested that the Left-Right scheme plays a crucial democratic \nfunction, enabling the recognition and legitimation of political discord, and that its absence \nor subordination to alternative registers is undesirable.\n6\n  If this is so \u2013 here is not the place to \nput it in question \u2013 then it seems plausible to assume an important guide to whether the Left-\nRight idiom can be expected to survive is the degree to which political actors have local \nreason to employ it.  It is arguably through an accumulation of local actions that symbolic \nregisters are generated and reproduced, and whatever larger democratic function they may \nhave is enabled.  The actions of politicians commanding media attention are likely to be an \ninfluential component of such processes.  By examining the tactical usage or repudiation of \nthe Left-Right vocabulary, one can thus probe whether harmony is likely between a certain \nkind of democratic ideal and the more pragmatic concerns of political actors.  Further, one \ncan consider whether the uses to which Left and Right may be put are conducive to the \ncategories having wider public resonance, or conversely whether they may contribute to the \ncategories\u2019 broader eclipse. \n \n \nBeyond a Correspondence View: Left, Right and the Practices of Positioning \n \nFamiliar readings of Left and Right, be they in scholarship, political discourse or journalism, \ntend to see them as terms providing a representational device for thinking about clusters of \npolitical views and their possible relations.  As already noted, they may be seen as largely \natemporal, with core meanings attached to each, meanings more fundamental than (existing, \nas it were, on a different plane from) whatever political views happen to be articulated in a \ngiven time and place.  Alternatively they may be seen rather as a snapshot of the ideational \n 4 \nconfiguration of a particular setting, with each term defined locally according to the views \nfound there in circulation.\n7\n  Additionally, they may be thought of as forming two poles on a \ncontinuum or \u2018spectrum\u2019, or they may be thought of dualistically as discrete, counter-posed \nentities.  In all such accounts, the Left-Right vocabulary is treated principally as something \nwhich communicates politics and political conflict, by corresponding to its contours, rather \nthan itself being the site of these activities.  That is to say, attention is directed beyond the \nlanguage itself to that which the language enables us to understand.  One sees this idea in \nsome of the metaphors used for Left and Right: it has been referred to for instance as the \n\u2018core currency of political exchange\u2019.8  In normal times, the role of a currency is to measure, \nto offer a means of calibration for values external to itself.  Likewise the comparison with a \nlanguage, \u2018Esperanto\u2019: languages are typically understood as media rather than objects with a \nlife of their own.\n9\n  Another metaphor one hears is that of the map: again, in the usual \nunderstanding, a map\u2019s role is to communicate to us information about something which lies \nbeyond the map.  While currencies, languages and maps can be the subject of contestation, \nthis is not what we associate with them in the normal run of things. \nFor the detached observer who seeks to analyse patterns of political behaviour, just as \nfor the engaged citizen who needs a workable representation of the political options \navailable, this conception of Left and Right will often be valid.  But two caveats are \nnecessary, ones which point us to an alternative approach.  First, representations of the \npolitical world can never be definitive.  The descriptions which can be provided using the \nLeft-Right framework, just as those which competing schemes can offer, are never beyond \ncontestation.  The reason is that one cannot expect perfect symmetry of understanding across \nall actors in the political field.  Even assuming the most dispassionate motivations, people are \nlikely to differ on at least one of the following points: 1) they may disagree on what the \norganising terms \u2018Left\u2019 and \u2018Right\u2019 mean.  Given the Left-Right distinction is substantively \nambiguous, it is debatable what metric it is supposed to evoke \u2013 whether it refers to \nconceptions of equality, for example, or the relation between equality and other values (e.g. \nliberty), or the level of commitment to rectifying inequality, or to conceptions of human \nnature (its improvability or resistance to improvement), or to conceptions and attitudes \ntowards historical change (e.g. stability vs progress).  Empirical research seems to confirm \nthis diversity of interpretations, albeit diversity which is not unbounded.\n10\n  2) Even if people \nhave a common understanding of the structure of political conflict, they may disagree on \nwhere particular political groupings are to be located in it.  They may disagree, for instance, \non who is \u2018Right\u2019 and who is \u2018Left\u2019, with the scope for disagreement all the greater if these \n 5 \nterms are understood to be poles on a continuum (is there a Centre, and if so where does it \nlie?).  3) More radically, there may be disagreement even on the fundamental question of \nwhether single-axis schemes such as Left and Right constitute a valid way of expressing the \ndistribution of political views.  Some will object to what they see as the simplification and \ndistortion of debate this entails, while others may be uncomfortable with the image of \nconflict rather than consensus it may imply. \nAsymmetry of understanding across the citizenry seems predictable.  The political \nworld is ineradicably complex, and no representation of it is likely to overcome this \u2013 \nperhaps certainly not one reliant on the simple yet ambiguous imagery of Left and Right.  \nThere is no \u2018political grammar\u2019 by which to regulate definitively the correct and incorrect \napplication of the Left-Right scheme.\n11\n  Some readings may be easily identified as \nidiosyncratic, but no single reading can be pinpointed as uncontestable, and it may be that \nseveral appear of which none can easily be dismissed.  If this is so, and \u2018neutral\u2019 readings are \nknown to be unreachable, it opens the possibility of Left and Right being the subject of play.  \nDiffering applications of the terminology are likely to come up against one another, and may \nbecome the site of contestation.  \nThis connects to the second major caveat, which is that not only are different readings \nof the political world possible but that different readings carry different political \nimplications, and individuals who have established political goals may therefore be \nmotivated to pursue some readings over others.\n12\n  The stakes are high when it comes to \npolitical mapping, as different representations of the political world may have serious \nconsequences for the profile and appeal of particular viewpoints: as we shall examine further, \nthey imply different things about which political actors are important and which minor, about \nwhere the important lines of political difference lie, and about the moral status of a given \npolitical perspective.  For a party to be described as \u2018far Left\u2019, for instance, is arguably for it \nto be described not just as adopting certain political commitments but also as being \n\u2018extreme\u2019, in the sense either of adopting radical (i.e. unusual, non-mainstream) political \nviews or, perhaps as a function of this, in the sense of being morally suspect.  The party thus \ndescribed, though it may welcome some such connotations, may wish to dispute others, \neither by contesting its placement on the spectrum or by contesting the spectrum\u2019s meaning \nand relevance.  From this point derives the motivation for party activists to seek to promote \ntheir favoured representation of the political world in a competitive clash with alternatives.  \nRight and Left, in other words, become political resources for reflexive political actors, \naffording opportunities to those who have control over them and risks to those who do not.  \n 6 \nIn Bourdieu\u2019s terms, they are a potential source of symbolic capital.13  One has good reason \ntherefore to study how actors appropriate, resist, or indeed ignore, the Left-Right \nterminology. \nThese practices of self- and other-categorisation using the vocabulary of Left and \nRight have notable resonance with the practices described by theorists of positioning.\n14\n  It is \nan approach which places particular emphasis on the situation-specific and contested usage \nof terms.  Rather than seeing speakers as fixed occupants of largely static roles or identities, \nthis approach sees them as engaged in an ongoing discursive process which involves the local \nassignation and acceptance or refusal of \u2018positions\u2019.15  Positions are defined relationally, like \nLeft and Right, are constructed in the individual speech situation, and may therefore be \nrelatively transient.  This does not contradict the idea of higher-order meanings which can be \nbrought in to regulate and criticise usage \u2013 indeed, \u2018meta-positionings\u2019 of this kind are what \nenable contestation.  In the case of Left and Right, one can affirm that they have certain \nstandardised or \u2018sedimented\u2019 meanings which place limits on the positioning moves which \nactors can engage in, while noting that their application retains plenty of scope for choice and \ndecision.\n16\n  Conflict may arise when an initial, \u2018first-order\u2019 act of positioning, rather than \nbeing tacitly accepted, comes to be contested in a \u2018second-order\u2019 move: when, for instance, \nthe invocation of \u2018Left\u2019 or \u2018Right\u2019 is explicitly rejected by another party to the discussion.17  \nAs suggested, this contestation of positions may derive from the asymmetrical understanding \nof different actors, or because of the different moral content of different positions and how \nthis may determine the meanings which actions carry.  While positioning theory was \ndeveloped initially for the micro-conversational setting, it has been usefully extended to \nlarger scales for the study of national and international politics, and it has relevance for the \nactions we shall discuss.\n18\n \nPositioning in the context of day-to-day politics has a distinctive characteristic, which \nis that it takes place before a potentially large public.  When politicians invoke categories to \nposition themselves and others, they do so in a context where their chief audience is not \nnecessarily their interlocutor but the anticipated one of citizens in general.  In representative \ndemocracy, representatives are one of the prime movers in the positioning game.  Sometimes \nrepresentatives may make explicit efforts to position large numbers of citizens (e.g. by \nevoking the moral outrage of a \u2018silent majority\u2019), a kind of positioning which is largely \nunilateral since only at certain electoral or revolutionary moments can those who are \naddressed answer back in an act of second-order positioning.  More often the addressee will \nbe other representatives \u2013 e.g. members of opposing parties.  But even then, when the \n 7 \nmajority of the population is an ostensibly passive audience, the role of the presumed listener \nis a critical one in giving sense and urgency to acts of positioning. \nLeft and Right, we may provisionally conclude, are immanent to political conflict \nrather than an exogenous framework by which to represent it.  Yet precisely because the \nterms are widely believed to be separate from the site of conflict, to be fairly neutral terms of \nanalysis, political actors can use them to achieve desired outcomes.  Their status as political \nresources derives in significant part from their ostensible function as mere descriptors.   \n \n \nLeft-Right Talk: Dimensions of Political Usage \n \nLet us move on to consider more closely the kinds of political use to which the categories \n\u2018Left\u2019 and \u2018Right\u2019 may be put.  The following discussion is distinctly qualitative and \ninterpretative in approach, based on a logic of purposeful selection.  It does not examine the \nfrequency with which Left and Right are invoked in a given corpus of text, nor the most \ncommon contexts in which such usage arises.  It does not, for instance, systematically \nexamine whether some moments in the political cycle are particularly prone to producing \nsuch talk, what the significance of different kinds of political system may be, or of a party\u2019s \nrole in government or opposition.\n19\n  Rather it looks at the effects the terms can be used to \nachieve when called upon.  It analyses several rich instances of the usage of Left-Right in \ncontemporary European politics, chosen for their suggestiveness and for their association \nwith diverse ideological traditions and electoral systems, using them to bring out some of the \nimportant features of political usage.\n20\n  While the collection is no doubt incomplete, it \nnonetheless well serves the larger goal of enabling a better appreciation of that distinctive \naspect of Left and Right which is their dynamic deployment in political exchange. \n \n \n1. Partisan Profiling \nPerhaps the most familiar use of these categories is the effort to indicate how different \npolitical groupings relate to one another and thereby to map the political field.  Left and \nRight can be used to identify friends and adversaries in a way which is easily grasped and \nwhich has a certain dramatic power.  We can refer to this as \u2018partisan profiling\u2019.  \nAnalytically, one may distinguish here between acts of self-positioning, which invoke Left or \nRight to characterise the speaker\u2019s own grouping, and acts of other-positioning, which \n 8 \ncharacterise the opponent.  We shall examine an instance of the former in a later section \nwhen considering the emergence of Germany\u2019s Left Party (Linkspartei).  It is important to \nremember however that all acts of positioning are relational, and so to engage in the one kind \nof positioning is simultaneously to engage in the other.\n21\n \nAn important matter in partisan profiling is the degree of proximity with which \ngroups are positioned to each other.  Left and Right can be used to position opponents as \nsimilar or identical to a generally disliked third party, intentionally overlooking the \ndifferences which may exist between them so as to discredit one by association with another: \nconsider the efforts made to discredit social democrats during the Cold War by associating \nthem with Soviet communism.\n22\n  Positing an alliance between one\u2019s adversaries allows a \npowerful frontier to be drawn between \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019.  Precisely because the Left-Right \nspectrum is nebulous in its meaning and calibration, the validity of these comparisons is not \nalways easily rejected, although the objects of a positioning move can of course seek to \ncontest the positioning.   \nIn the contemporary period, an interesting example is provided by the British \nConservative MEP and journalist Daniel Hannan, in a newspaper article concerning how the \nBritish National Party (BNP) relates to other parties.  Although a presence in British politics \nfor some time, the BNP recently came to prominence due to victories in local council by-\nelections (notably Swanley in Kent in mid-February 2009, shortly before Hannan\u2019s article) as \nwell as gains in the 2009 European Parliamentary elections.  This challenge to the established \nstructure of British politics \u2013 albeit a modest one \u2013 presents a novel situation to which other \npolitical actors may feel compelled to respond, and indeed an opportunity for them to re-map \nthe political landscape as they would like it to be appraised.  Hannan\u2019s article, in the \nconservative Telegraph newspaper, goes under the heading \u2018There\u2019s nothing right-wing \nabout the BNP\u2019.23  It sets up the argument that the BNP receives far more publicity than is \nwarranted by the relatively low threat it poses to British society and politics.  Having \nconsidered various possible reasons for why this should be so, the article reaches its climax \nas follows:  \n \n\u2018Above all, though, the BNP is used as an indirect weapon against the mainstream Right. You will \nhave noticed that the party is almost never mentioned without the soubriquet \u201cfar Right\u201d.  The BNP \ndoesn\u2019t call itself Right-wing, of course. It favours nationalisation, higher taxes, protectionism and \n(though it keeps quiet about this) republicanism. It markets itself as \u201cthe Labour Party your parents \nvoted for\u201d. Its manifesto calls for \u201cthe selective exclusion of foreign-made goods from British markets \nand the reduction of foreign imports,\u201d and promises to \u201crestore our economy and land to British \nownership\u201d and \u201cto give workers a stake in the success and prosperity of the enterprises whose profits \n 9 \ntheir labour creates by encouraging worker shareholder and co-operative schemes\u201d.  As Hayek wrote in \n1944 in his brilliant chapter on \u201cthe socialist roots of Nazism\u201d, the dispute between fascists and \nsocialists is a dispute between brothers. Labour and the BNP are, in a sense, competing for the same \nsort of voter: one who believes in the power of the state. The one kind of voter whom both fascists and \nsocialists regard as beyond persuasion is the small-government Tory.  The real purpose of banging on \nabout the \u201cfar-Right BNP\u201d is to damage, by association, the Conservatives.  If hurting the Tories \nmeans giving the BNP enough free publicity to keep it alive, it\u2019s a price some Lefties seem happy to \npay.\u2019   \n \nThe first thing one may notice here is the prominence given to the categories Left and Right: \ntheir significance as resources seems well recognised, since the piece is centrally concerned \nwith protecting the reputation of the \u2018mainstream Right\u2019 from malign association, and with \nidentifying the proper configuration of relations between its opponents.  The text implicitly \nacknowledges that the Conservatives are indeed a party of the Right \u2013 an alternative \ndistancing tactic would have been to deny this, perhaps re-positioning at the Centre or \nabandoning such categories altogether \u2013 and that the moral content of the category must be \npreserved unblemished.  Coupled with this of course is the intent to conjure those agents of \nthe Left who are to blame for this habit of association.  These agents are positioned as \nfrivolous and irresponsible (\u2018Lefties\u2019 evidently being diminutive) and as lacking in morals \n(for they play this dangerous game in awareness that there is a price to be paid).  Meanwhile \nthe BNP, though its association with the Right is denied, is nonetheless implied to be a party \nwhich can be understood in Left-Right terms: there is no suggestion that it escapes such \nclassification. \nNotice in particular how the meaning of the Left-Right divide is defined.  At stake is \nsaid to be the power of the State \u2013 not, for instance, the desire to seek the rectification of \ninequality.  Whereas many \u2013 including a large number of those who self-identify with the \nLeft \u2013 might see the question of the State as one of means rather than ends,24 and might be \ninclined to see statism as an orientation orthogonal to Left and Right, Hannan presents it as \nthe crux of the debate.  In so doing he draws on a line of reasoning often associated with \nthinkers of the Right: Hayek is the chosen source, though Karl Popper would have been a \nplausible alternative.\n25\n  That Left and Right are meaningful is the premise of the argument \u2013 \nbehind them lie established ideological traditions (fascism, socialism and conservatism) \nwhich, it is suggested, continue to find expression in contemporary party politics.  Yet the \ncore of the Left-Right opposition is said to be how much government is desired.  It is by \nevoking the political divide along this dimension that Hannan is able to re-position Labour \nand the BNP as in fact far closer to each other than either is to the Conservative Right, and to \n 10 \npresent them at all plausibly as \u2018brothers\u2019.  Thus Left and Right are not merely acknowledged \nin a defensive move but deployed offensively to redescribe the political scene as the speaker \nprefers. \nAs a rule, one might expect political actors to favour those representational schemes \nwhich allow their own grouping to occupy a distinctive location in political space while \ndownplaying the differences amongst their opponents.  In line with social identity theory, \nwhich posits that persons seek not just a positive sense of selfhood but a distinctive one,\n26\n one \nmight suppose that actors will want the differences on which they pride themselves to stand \nout and will avoid schemes liable to blur their identity with those they consider quite \ndifferent from themselves.  This is presumably one reason why anarchists and libertarians \nhave often favoured a two-dimensional scale in which a Left-Right axis is crossed with \nanother defined by attitudes to authority (cf. the Pournelle and Nolan scales), and why Green \nactivists sometimes object to a Left-Right spectrum insofar as it obscures what they consider \nmost important and distinctive \u2013 their stance towards the environment.  It is worth noting \nhowever that the preference for a distinctive location in political space may not be universal: \nin line with recent accounts of the emergence of \u2018cartel parties\u2019,27 some actors may pursue \nthe strategy of deliberately blurring their political commitments so as to avoid alienating \nthose who might otherwise vote for them.  We shall return to the case of New Labour in a \nlater section. \n \n \n2. Legitimising and Subverting \nThe Hannan example involves a move ostensibly designed to indicate how political groups \nrelate to one another.  It can be considered one of a class of efforts to suggest proximity and \ndistance, to accord visibility or withhold it.  These are matters of orientation \u2013 of indicating \nto the listener who \u2018we\u2019 are and how we relate to \u2018them\u2019.  But it will already be clear that \nsuch acts of self- and other-positioning are not just about orientation: they are also about \nasserting the validity of \u2018our\u2019 perspective and casting doubt on that of the opponent.  Left and \nRight are used to signal varying degrees of legitimacy. \nWhen invoked for the purposes of other-positioning, Left and Right are often \nderogatory categories.  They may be used to unmask the opponent, to reveal her true colours \nand contest a prior act of self-positioning.  Consider for example the words of Peter \nMandelson, British Minister and senior Labour Party figure, in his speech to the 2009 Party \n 11 \nConference,\n28\n in which he seeks to reveal the true nature of the then Conservative opposition \nand to undermine Conservative efforts to re-position themselves on the political spectrum: \n  \n\u2018[\u2026] the Tories seem not to realise that change has to be more than a slogan.  The first rule of any \nmarketing strategy is that it must reflect the product it is selling.   And what is becoming more evident \nby the day is that, in their case, it doesn\u2019t.  The two faces of the Conservative Party are increasingly on \nshow. The one they want to present to the public of a revamped Tory party. And the other that betrays \nthe reality of traditional right-wing Conservatism.  [\u2026]  Show me what has really changed in the \nConservative Party.  The truth is that the old Tory right that was rejected in 1997 are quietly feeling at \nhome again with David Cameron.\u2019 \n \n[Later]:  \u2018We need to fight back.  Of course we do.  But to do so successfully it is up to us to explain \u2013 \nwith confidence, clarity and conviction \u2013 what the choice is.  The choice between a Conservative party \nwhose judgements on the credit crunch were wrong, or a party providing leadership in the toughest of \ntimes.  A choice between a party that lurches to the right the second it sees a chance of doing so, or our \nparty that is resolutely in the progressive centre.\u2019 \n \nWe shall return to various features of this text, but note for the moment that we have here an \naccount of self-positioning by the Conservatives, as a \u2018revamped\u2019 party at the political centre, \nbeing contested as mere show, a kind of false trading which tries but fails to disguise an ugly \nreality.  Precision requires us to say that the self-positioning here is in fact a form of other-\npositioning, for we encounter it as it is reported by an opponent.  Having rejected the \nreported move, the speaker instead re-positions the party as the latest form of \u2018traditional \nright-wing conservatism\u2019 and the secret home of the \u2018old Tory right\u2019.  By invoking the \npolitical spectrum, the speaker conjures tensions in the opponent\u2019s self-positioning, \nsuggesting they seek to occupy two positions at once, with the connotations of \ndisingenuousness and division this brings.\n29\n \nThe word \u2018lurch\u2019 can be read as underlining the unsubtle, abrupt and uncontrolled \nnature of this return to basic instincts.  It is a word which is commonly paired in English with \n\u2018Left\u2019 and \u2018Right\u2019 when these terms are pinned to the opponent, and indeed a senior member \nof the Conservative party had used it just a few months before to accuse the Labour party of \n\u2018lurching left \u2013 off the centre ground that Tony Blair put them on all those years ago.\u201930  \nAgain, we see the notion of a reversion to type.  The two speakers use identical language, yet \ntry to represent recent British politics in quite asymmetrical ways.  Note that, theoretically at \nleast, the one who speaks first has a first-mover advantage, since they can position \nthemselves as they wish and can force a position onto their interlocutor.  Of course, even in a \n 12 \nsmall-scale, private conversation, so long as it is of a certain duration, this advantage may be \ninsufficient to determine the outcome of the discursive exchange; in the political case the \nadvantage is yet weaker, since debate is ongoing and one struggles to identify a beginning \nand end.  Still, certain institutional factors may accord a small advantage of this kind: those \nin government may have opportunities to position their opponents in advantageous ways, for \ninstance as reactive rather than initiatory, critical rather than constructive.  \nMandelson positions Labour as being \u2018resolutely in the progressive centre\u2019.  He thus \ndesists from using \u2018Left\u2019 or \u2018Right\u2019 for self-positioning \u2013 to align with the Left for instance \nwould risk acquiring some of the negative associations the term may carry, e.g. of moralism \nand a lack of realism.  Yet by invoking the \u2018centre\u201931 he is still drawing on the idea of a Left-\nRight spectrum, albeit gravitating to the mid-point on the continuum (see below for further \ndiscussion).  The idea of a centre is in a sense an artefact of the spectrum metaphor \u2013 and \nwhether ideological positions merge into each other as part of a continuum is less obvious \nthan the metaphor implies.  Note the connotations of neutrality and reasonableness which this \ncentre brings with it, coupled with the implication that positions far from the centre are of \nsuspect rationality, perhaps also of marginal political relevance.  Here we see how self-\npositioning and other-positioning interrelate, and how each position carries moral content.  \nAs Daalder notes,\n32\n a Left-Right spectrum invites the superimposition of a normal-\ndistribution curve at its centre, implying \u2013 sometimes quite spuriously \u2013 that this is where \nmajority opinion lies and that views located away from the centre are held only by a small \nminority.  Yet Mandelson seems concerned to emphasise that occupying the centre does not \nimply indifference to the question of conservatism vs progress, hence the need to qualify the \ncentre (this one at least) as \u2018progressive\u2019.33   \nOne way in which opposing views may be undermined using \u2018Left\u2019 and \u2018Right\u2019 is by \nplaying on some of the specific negative associations these terms have accrued in \ncontemporary political culture \u2013 e.g. naivety on the Left or heartlessness on the Right.34  And \nby invoking these connotations, speakers can reinforce them and thereby reinforce their \nfuture utility.  But the effort to subvert need not necessarily rely on the specific semantic \nassociations of Left and Right: the terms can be used instead to suggest that the opponent\u2019s \nviewpoint is merely one amongst many.  To call something a \u2018right-wing\u2019 viewpoint is \nimmediately to suggest that there are other valid viewpoints to be had, that it is but one of \nmany and necessarily susceptible to critique.  One might call this \u2018weak subversion\u2019: it does \nnot automatically suggest that the initially proffered view is invalid, but it suggests at least \nthat it must defend itself against other valid perspectives.  It places a question-mark beside it.  \n 13 \nInsofar as Left and Right are commonly assumed to make up a horizontal axis whose \ncomponent points carry connotations of equal legitimacy,\n35\n placing a viewpoint on this axis \nis to suggest that it carries the same burden of justification as other views. \nLeft and Right can also be used for what one may call \u2018strong subversion\u2019: here the \nspeaker\u2019s intention may be understood as not simply to suggest the target position is one \namongst many, but to suggest that it is blinkered and partial.  In the Gordon Brown text \nexamined later \u2013 \u2018Why the Right is Wrong\u2019 \u2013 the word \u2018Right\u2019 is often paired in this sense \nwith \u2018ideological\u2019 (e.g. p.18).  To be Right, it is implied, is to take just one side\u2019s perspective \non things.  Speakers may heighten the effectiveness of this by suggesting that Left and Right \nare not so much consciously, rationally chosen viewpoints as identities, things so deeply \ningrained in the opponent that she is unable to shake them off.  (Think back to the notion \nabove of parties \u2018lurching\u2019 back to their core selves.)  When Left and Right are conjured as \nidentities, the opponent\u2019s views are presented as simply an extension of who they are.  Just as \nsomeone might delegitimise a favourable account of Josip Tito by positioning the speaker as \na Yugoslav nationalist, or criticism of Israel by casting the speaker as anti-Semitic, they may \nsubvert a favourable account of the market by positioning the speaker as \u2018right-wing\u2019.  Such \na positioning move relies on a kind of genetic fallacy, suggesting a view is invalid because \n\u2018she would say that, wouldn\u2019t she\u2019.  It is little reliant on the particular semantic content of \nLeft and Right in a given time and place, since it is almost always considered the mark of \nbias or irrationality to advocate something simply because of who you are.  Hence the \nincentive for speakers as above to resist this type of classification by positioning themselves \nas of \u2018the Centre\u2019. \nAn interesting piece of empirical research suggests some party activists may be \nacutely aware of the dangers of appearing constitutively \u2018Left\u2019 or \u2018Right\u2019.  In a series of \ndiscussions with local councillors in Britain, David Weltman notes the consistency with \nwhich speakers question the enduring relevance of Left and Right, particularly as \ndescriptions of their own activity, all the while affirming the sincerity of their political \nengagement.\n36\n  It is observed how speakers\u2019 autobiographical narratives tend to evoke them \nas consistently independent of Left and Right \u2013 as non-ideological, non-partisan even \u2013 and \nto suggest that Left-Right politics is what others do.  Rather than subsuming themselves \nwithin a collective political identity, be it Left, Right, or a party label, speakers carefully seek \nto maintain the autonomy of their selfhood, describing their political work in terms of a \ncontingent overlap between their personal political goals and the instrumental opportunities \nwhich the party affords.  One may interpret this as an effort to ward off the possibility of \n 14 \nbeing positioned constitutively as \u2018of the Left\u2019 or \u2018of the Right\u2019 and to sidestep the \nunwelcome delegitimising effects which may accompany this.\n37\n \n  \n \n3.  Evoking Continuity and Rupture \nBeyond the usages discussed, Left and Right can also be deployed to evoke a historical \ncontext for the events of the present.  The terms suggest continuity, both in who the \nprotagonists of political conflict are and in the stakes over which they struggle.  They can be \nused to give unified meaning to what otherwise might appear a series of disconnected, local \ndisagreements, and to evoke an enduring constituency \u2013 something which ultimately may \nassist in the mobilisation of supporters.  As we have said, this notion of an enduring core \nmeaning to political conflict may be suspect, but it is powerfully suggested by the historical \nlineage of the categories nonetheless.  Indeed, the appearance of continuity may have special \nappeal in times of flux, when the reality of political conflict is arguably more complex and \nthe stability of party groupings is uncertain.\n38\n  When parties themselves are prone to appear \nand disappear in quick succession, and their own names are therefore an insufficient basis for \nsuggesting political continuity, or when their political goals are thought to be undergoing \nchange and their connection with the past is therefore in question, the evocation of ideal \ngroupings which transcend the messiness of reality may have appeal.  \u2018The Left\u2019 and \u2018the \nRight\u2019, categories of the highest abstraction, offer this possibility. \nIt is a possibility which can be drawn upon in day-to-day politics, and we have seen \nabove Peter Mandelson\u2019s desire to cast the contemporary British Conservatives, for all their \ntalk of change, as the latest incarnation of a right-wing tradition.  It is a possibility which can \nalso be drawn upon when a party chooses its name, an interesting case of which is the \nGerman Left Party (Linkspartei).  The Left Party was formed in June 2007 out of a merger of \nthe Party of Democratic Socialism (the successor to the ruling party of the DDR, the Socialist \nUnity Party) \u2013 and the Electoral Alternative for Labour and Social Justice (WASG).  The first \nachievement of the name \u2018Left Party\u2019, coined in the years immediately preceding this \nmerger,\n39\n is to suggest unity under conditions of fragmentation.  The movement out of which \nthe party formed was (and remains) divided in multiple ways: territorially between East and \nWest, ideologically between reformist and pragmatist ex-communists and radical ex-social \ndemocrats, and strategically between parliament- and movement-oriented activists.\n40\n  The \nabstract terminology of \u2018Links\u2019 facilitates efforts to alleviate these divisions, both due to its \nsimplicity and due to the way it affirms the broad contours of the party\u2019s ideological \n 15 \ngenealogy while affording the party the space neither explicitly to acknowledge or to deny its \nlinks with the DDR.\n41\n \nBut more than this, the name entails the supra-partisan category \u2018Left\u2019 being \nappropriated to act as a party label.  This allows the party to position itself as the authentic \ninheritor and consolidator of a political tradition, to evoke its place in history, while \nimplicitly raising the possibility that other German parties which position themselves as on \nthe Left (or are conventionally thought to be such) are in some way impostors, that they are \ndiscontinuous with that tradition, perhaps even of the Right.  To understand this case of \n\u2018forced positioning\u2019, the political context of the Linkspartei\u2019s formation is important.42  One \nneeds to recall that Germany\u2019s major parties of the Left, the SPD (in particular) and the \nGreens, had widely been seen as abandoning certain core commitments since, in coalition \ngovernment under Schroeder in 2003, they had introduced the Agenda 2010 \/ Hartz laws.  \nNearly 200,000 members left the SPD in this period, and the party was regarded by many, \neven if it did not always endorse this, as having completed a break with its left-wing past and \na move towards a \u2018Neue Mitte\u2019.43  The Linkspartei, by positioning itself not just as \u2018of the \nLeft\u2019 but as \u2018the Left\u2019 (and the word \u2018party\u2019 often drops out of the name to leave just \u2018Die \nLinke\u2019), casts itself as prototypical, as the key landmark on the evacuated political terrain.  It \nis partly a case of partisan profiling as described above.  More generally, one needs to recall \nthe wider doubts since the end of the Cold War concerning the continued relevance of left-\nwing politics, and concerns that, with the absence of major ideas-based oppositions, politics \nwill become emptied of meaning and citizens will have little reason to engage.  By drawing \nso prominently on the term \u2018Left\u2019, the Linkspartei seems to assert that the stakes of political \nconflict are as serious and meaningful as ever, that politics entails an authentic clash of ideas \nand not just a trivialised clash of personalities.  The conflict is thereby \u2018dignified\u2019.  By styling \nitself in these terms, the party presents itself as the re-emergence of a long-standing historical \nforce (\u2018eine strategische Neuaufstellung der Linken in Deutschland\u2019, as PDS Chairman \nLothar Bisky declared when announcing his party\u2019s change of name44), and makes available \na political identity for those who might incline to it. \nSuch observations can be made independently of information about the thought-\nprocesses of individual decision-makers: whether all such considerations were the stuff of \ncognitive reflection in the particular case is probably unknowable, and an understanding of \nthe pragmatic possibilities \u2018Left\u2019 and \u2018Right\u2019 offer is not dependent on knowing it.  But \nconsider nonetheless Bisky\u2019s words when elaborating on the spirit of the name change, in \nwhich many of these thoughts are made explicit: \n \n 16 \n\u2018Even though the real work on the project for a new Left in Germany begins only after the Bundestag \nelection, nonetheless a signal should be given, in the name of the party standing for election, of our \nintention to begin something new.  A lot of emotions and traditions hang on a party's very name.  At \nstake is the protection and development of identities.  At the same time, the chances of such a future \nproject must not be gambled away.  [\u2026]  With this change of name, the PDS makes clear that, having \nrespect for its history and the protection of its programmatic core, it is ready to widen its identity and \nthereby become the seed-crystal for a new Left in Germany.  With this name, the voters know where \nthey stand.  There are no false pretences.  I call on the members of the PDS to take this step and in so \ndoing to open up new perspectives for the Left in Germany.  One can call this opportunity historic or \nnot, as one prefers.  But the opportunity of the moment is this: to create in Germany an example that \nshows that the Left is not in the process of fracturing itself ever further but on the contrary is coming \ntogether and joining as one; to create an example that shows how something which has different roots \nin East and West, and which until today has represented and addressed two quite different social \nmilieus in the two places, can grow together equally; to establish in Germany a political power to the \nleft of the SPD which can evolve into a permanent presence as the third-strongest political force; to \nimprove the chances for a politics of social justice, of peace and democracy.  When I look at the latest \nmanifesto proposals of the SPD and the Greens, I can only say this: Red works [Rot wirkt].\u201945 \n \nSet amongst the discussion of new beginnings, notice the emphasis on continuity \u2013 the notion \nof a \u2018new Left\u2019 sets the party in a historical tradition, as does the reference to the colour red \u2013 \nand the gesture to the idea of authenticity in the suggestion that the Party presents itself to \nvoters without false pretences.  The SPD and Greens are evoked as a foil, and the SPD \npositioned in limbo with the suggestion that the Left-to-come lies somewhere to its left.  \nEvident too is the concern to evoke unity in the context of division, to transcend a history of \nsplits and the diverse trajectories of East and West, combined with the notion that the \nLinkspartei may act as the core around which a wider renewed Left coalesces.  Through this \ncareful management of the Party\u2019s identity, the speaker is able to emphasise the novelty of \nthe moment while nonetheless ensuring that these developments remain recognisable as \ncontinuations of the past. \n \nWe have seen above how the application of Left and Right may be contested in the \nspecific instance.  The appellation \u2018Left\u2019 or \u2018Right\u2019 may be used unreflexively in a first-order \nact of positioning (of the self or others), or it may be explicitly rejected.  Arguably more \nradical than either move is to contest the very meaningfulness of the vocabulary itself, \nsuggesting the terms are no longer relevant to contemporary politics.  Rather than suggesting \n\u2018I am neither Left nor Right, though my opponent is\u2019 (as in the Mandelson quotation above), \nhere the speaker suggests that the terms are in fact of little applicability to anyone.  This has \n 17 \nbeen a fairly common trope in recent years amongst those endorsing a \u2018third way\u2019, although \nrejections of Left and Right are often qualified.  At first sight this would seem to be not so \nmuch a usage of Left \/ Right as a disavowal of such usage.  Yet to reject something explicitly \n\u2013 as opposed simply to overlooking it \u2013 is of course at the same time to acknowledge it, and \nmoreover to seek to capitalise on its meaning.   \nExplicit denigrations of Left and Right may be made exactly to undermine the \ncontinuity of political time which the categories suggest, and instead to herald a rupture.  \nBritish New Labour discourse in the mid-1990s was well stocked with notions of going \n\u2018beyond Left and Right\u2019.46  This can be understood partly in terms of the points already \nnoted: the desire to avoid having oneself tagged as ideological and partial rather than free-\nthinking, and to avoid association with ideas apparently discredited after the Cold War.  One \ncan present oneself as fresh and independent.  Yet such goals would have been adequately \nachievable simply by repositioning the party at the centre of a still-affirmed Left-Right \ncontinuum \u2013 in the spirit perhaps of Macmillan\u2019s \u2018middle way\u2019, or the German SPD\u2019s Neue \nMitte.  To suggest instead that the very idea of the continuum is emblematic of \u2018old-style \npolitics\u2019 is to go a step further: it evokes a more deep-seated Zeitgeist in which the country as \na whole and its politics are cast as \u2018new\u2019 or \u2018young\u2019 and the links with the past are severed.47  \nOne might say that Blair\u2019s Labour declared not just that it itself and its subjective preferences \nhad changed but that political life as a whole had changed: everything New Labour is then in \na sense merely symptomatic of a new Britain.  (It is a move which neatly enables later claims \nthat everything which is of \u2018new Britain\u2019 is in fact of New Labour.)  The negative usage of \nLeft and Right \u2013 a usage nonetheless \u2013 thereby allows the assertion of discontinuity and new \nbeginnings, a kind of \u2018year zero\u2019 in the life of the country and not just the party, thereby \nevoking a more general atmosphere of possibility, of a new politics outside the conventional \n\u2018mainstream\u2019, and wrong-footing those opponents who would seek to reposition the party \nwith appeal to the Left-Right spectrum.\n48\n \n \n \nSubstitutions \n \nTo renounce categories explicitly, and to do so repeatedly, is in a sense not to renounce them \nat all, since in doing so they continue to act as reference-points.  For as long as speakers feel \nthe need to assert the redundancy of Left and Right, the continuity of political time has not \nbeen and cannot be fully ruptured.  Left and Right are \u2018sticky\u2019 categories in this sense: like \nglue on the fingers, efforts to remove them can end up dispersing them.  But there is of \n 18 \ncourse a different scenario, in which what one sees is not so much the loud renunciation of \nthe terms as their quiet avoidance.  The possibility is conceivable given, as we have seen, the \nterms come not only with utility but with pitfalls, particularly when applied to the self.  \nInsofar as the symbolic capital of political mapping is too precious for political actors to \nabandon altogether, there is instead the prospect that \u2018Left\u2019 and \u2018Right\u2019 come to be \nsubstituted with alternative terms promising the benefits without the drawbacks.   \nConsider the following.  Shortly before the May 2010 British General Election, Prime \nMinister and Labour leader Gordon Brown released under his name a pamphlet headed \u2018Why \nthe Right is Wrong\u2019.49  This was a complex and sizeable text, though presumably intended to \nhave electoral influence.  As the title suggests, the term \u2018Right\u2019 features prominently: 63 \ntimes, not including the running title which places it on each second page.  Indeed, the author \ngoes out of his way to apply it, not just to domestic debates but to international affairs, where \nLeft-Right traditions can be especially amorphous.  Notwithstanding the Party\u2019s interest in \nnarratives of \u2018beyond Left and Right\u2019, such enthusiasm is understandable given the term\u2019s \nusefulness in evoking a single, intransigent opponent to be resisted.  Yet one striking aspect \nof the text is the rarity of the term \u2018Left\u2019: it features just four times.  That Left-Right \ndisagreements are meaningful is affirmed: \u2018Left and Right, Labour and Tory, progressive and \nconservative \u2013 these labels represent real and important differences in how we understand the \nworld and the society in which we live \u2026.\u201950  Left-Right divergence on the value of equality \nis emphasised.  Yet for the most part the authorial perspective is not presented as a Left one.  \nInstead, it is presented as a \u2018progressive\u2019 one.  The word is used 54 times in the text (plus in \nthe sub-title) in a wide variety of formulations: \u2018progressive values \/ ideas \/ thinking \/ \nthought \/ politics \/ tradition \/ philosophy and creed\u2019, as well as reference to us \u2018as \nprogressives\u2019 and the present as a \u2018progressive moment\u2019.  Thus while the Left-Right \nvocabulary is by no means absent in the text, one of its terms has been substituted, with the \nkey opposition cast as Right vs progressive. \nBrown\u2019s text is by no means the only place where \u2018progressive\u2019 has recently made its \nappearance in this form.  It features in Mandelson\u2019s words above, in the work of Labour-\nrelated thinkers,\n51\n and it became widely visible during the election campaign itself.\n52\n  As \nnoted earlier, political mapping can acquire added urgency under conditions of complexity \nand flux, when the names of the major parties become inadequate as guides to the political \nscene and when categories of higher generality are sought.  Such were the conditions in this \nelection when it became clear no party was likely to win an outright majority of \nparliamentary seats and that some form of coalition government might be necessary.  The \n 19 \nemergence of the Liberal Democrats during campaign polling as plausible determinants of \nthe post-electoral configuration encouraged efforts both to find ways of mapping that \nconfiguration and of influencing it by evoking the sympathies needed for so-called \u2018tactical \nvoting\u2019.  Through repeated mention of a possible \u2018progressive alliance\u2019 or \u2018progressive \ncoalition\u2019, generally understood as between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, one could \nhope to profile these parties as closely akin, and thereby convince their supporters to vote for \neach others\u2019 representatives in constituencies where this offered the best chance of defeating \nthe Conservatives.  Out of an increasingly unstable situation a dualistic order could be \nasserted anew. \nLike the term \u2018Left\u2019, \u2018progressive\u2019 has immediate appeal as a category of political \nabstraction in that it cannot be reduced to any one political party or ideological tradition.  No-\none has written the definitive progressive manifesto; it can only be used as a cluster-term.  It \nhas an important historical pedigree, having depicted a left-liberal position in US democracy \nsince early in the twentieth century.  As a term of substitution for the \u2018Left\u2019 (which it is \ncertainly not always), it offers clear possibilities for partisan profiling.  In Brown\u2019s text it \nfunctions to position the self as forward-looking and in tune with a presumed appetite in the \ngeneral public for a \u2018new politics\u2019, and to mark out an opponent which by definition cannot \nthen claim these qualities.  One of its plausible paired opposites \u2013 \u2018conservative\u2019 \u2013 neatly \nisolates the major political opponent, yet the term is not so unambiguously adversarial as to \nexclude a more consensual, bipartisan reading.  At the same time it hints at cross-temporal \ncontinuity.  Just as the Linkspartei\u2019s use of \u2018Left\u2019 lifts eyes from a particular time and place \nto the ongoing relevance of long-standing traditions, \u2018progressive\u2019 points to deep-seated \noppositions of principle rather than the ephemeral and personality-based oppositions some \nmight infer from conflict in its party guise (Labour and Conservative).  In line with the text\u2019s \nphilosophical references, adversarialism is given seriousness and \u2018substance\u2019.  Moreover, the \nterm avoids some of the pitfalls of \u2018Left\u2019 for self-positioning: it avoids the suggestion of \nmarginality and deviance, allowing the \u2018progressive\u2019 to claim he \/ she is of the centre (cf. \nMandelson) and the majority.  Also, while both terms can function as both adjectives and \nnouns, \u2018progressive\u2019 as a noun is more easily pluralised (as it often is in Brown\u2019s pamphlet).  \nWhereas \u2018the Left\u2019, as a capitalised, collective singular, suggests a monolithic bloc, \n\u2018progressives\u2019 as a plural form suggests an aggregate of people who retain their individuality \nwhile happening to share certain values.  Pluralism in form hints at pluralism in ethos, \nevoking individuals who are independent-minded and diverse. \n 20 \nIf \u2018progressive\u2019 initially seems more than adequate as a substitute for \u2018Left\u2019, this view \nneeds qualifying.\n53\n  First, its pairing with \u2018Right\u2019 in the text cited is indicative of its \nlimitations.  \u2018Progressive\u2019 lacks an accepted and credibly endorsed counter-concept.  That \nfew political actors in the modern world would resist the description \u2018progressive\u2019 is both its \nstrength and weakness: it enables the speaker to describe themselves in a way that maximises \ntheir appeal (and Brown reiterates that his values are those of the \u2018British people\u2019 as a \nwhole), but at the expense of being able to conjure a plausible opponent.  Readers will be \nfamiliar with the fact the Conservative leader David Cameron soon positioned his own \nparty\u2019s post-electoral coalition with the Liberal Democrats as a \u2018progressive partnership\u2019.54  \nOnce the appeal of a term becomes commonsensical, that appeal may dissipate.  Second, the \nterm \u2018progressive\u2019 does not permit gradation.  Whereas \u2018centre-Left\u2019 is ostensibly \nmeaningful, \u2018semi-progressive\u2019 or even \u2018moderately progressive\u2019 seems to jar.  One struggles \nto identify the distinct strands of a \u2018progressive coalition\u2019 using the same terminology, \nwhereas those of a \u2018centre-Left\u2019 coalition can themselves be submitted to Left-Right \nanalysis.\n55\n  Third, the prestige of \u2018Left-Right\u2019 is underpinned by its transnational diffusion.  \nAlternative umbrella terms face the challenge that, being less widely established, they are \nliable to seem parochial.  This in itself may diminish their credibility.  And lastly, to the \nextent Left and Right have certain problematic connotations when applied to the self, they \nretain \u2013 as Brown\u2019s text indicates \u2013 an inverse appeal for the positioning of others. \nConcepts evolve, and an assessment of their applicatory potential needs ongoing \nrevision.  Yet in the near future the substitution of the Left-Right idiom by alternative \nvocabularies seems likely to be no more than partial.  \u2018Left\u2019 and \u2018Right\u2019 can be expected to \npersist, perhaps even to retain their status as the resources for mapping par excellence.  \nPractices of substitution remain significant however, for they enable what is impossible using \njust the one vocabulary.  What they permit a speaker to do is to seek refuge from the \noutrageous simplicity and contestability of any one particular mapping scheme.  Left, Right \nand their alternatives are highly imperfect analytical tools, and speakers will occasionally \nneed the option of taking distance from the categories or casting them in an ironic light.  \nThey will need the capacity to suggest that, however problematic we know \u2018Left\u2019, \u2018Right\u2019 \nand their alternatives to be, the underlying configuration they refer to is real.  Synonyms, and \nterms used as functional equivalents, provide just this possibility.  When Brown sets a series \nof oppositions side by side \u2013 \u2018Left and Right, Labour and Tory, progressive and \nconservative\u2019 \u2013 he gives an apparent credibility to the dualistic political order he wishes to \nevoke, and avoids loading any one of these oppositions with the entire burden of descriptive \n 21 \nplausibility.  Each compensates in some measure for the inadequacy of every other.  Having \nsecured the reality of the object world, he is then free to pursue the combination best suited to \nthe purposes of the text. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nWe have seen that the categories of Left and Right have a life beyond their existence as tools \nfor analysis by the detached political observer.  Political actors put them to use to position \nthemselves and others, achieving a number of effects thereby, of which three salient ones \nhave been explored.  The terms thus act as a versatile political resource, one whose prestige \nis no doubt consolidated by the fact that they nonetheless hint at being more than merely \npartisan, at being the stuff of objectivity and cold analysis.  The examples we have examined \nshow Left and Right being used by political actors commonly associated with both, and in \nthe varied contexts of Germany\u2019s entrenched system of proportional representation and \nBritain\u2019s Westminster model.  The latter in particular is something of a critical case, given \nthat Left-Right talk is more conventionally associated with complex political scenes \ninvolving many political actors, and given the political hegemony of a party making at least \nsome claims to have gone \u2018beyond Left and Right\u2019. \nThese reflections suggest a number of things.  They suggest first that a full \nunderstanding of these political categories must go beyond the effort to specify their \nsemantic content, whether understood as a universal dualism or a time- and space-bound \nconstruct.  Without rejecting the validity and value of such discussions, one should not \noverlook the ways Left and Right are employed for the purposes of positioning.  Studying the \ncategories in this way suggests, second, that there are reasons to expect them to remain in \ncurrency for some time yet.  For as long as political actors find their usage productive, their \nfull disappearance seems unlikely.  Even the tactic of disavowing them has proved partial \nand temporary in some salient cases: Labour thinker Anthony Giddens, despite talk of \n\u2018breaking out\u2019 of past ways of thinking and of going \u2018beyond Left and Right\u2019, long continued \nto speak of the Third Way as a reinvention of the Centre-Left, and more recently has \nsuggested that the critical stance towards the Left-Right vocabulary was but a short-term \nstrategy for emphasising a break with some of the traditional commitments of socialist \nthinking.\n56\n  The pragmatic appeal of the vocabulary remains evident.  There are no doubt \nother terms which can be used for political mapping \u2013 we have looked at the word \n\u2018progressive\u2019 \u2013 and one cannot exclude that some will show themselves more useful than \n 22 \nLeft-Right.  But such substitutions seem unlikely to be wholesale, for the very multiplicity of \nterms can itself be useful.  And here potentially is a point of some democratic significance.  \nIf, as some have argued, the imagery of Left and Right is one there are reasons to want to see \npreserved, it is important to consider what motives political activists, as those in a privileged \nposition to maintain the usage of the vocabulary, might have for evoking it.  The functional \nbenefits which accrue at the systemic level may well be an insufficient motivation, and local \npurposes may need to be present: hence the importance of examining the objectives the usage \nof the vocabulary may serve, which may therefore keep the terms in circulation.   \nOne may wonder of course whether they will persist in a form conducive to their \nresonance amongst a wider public.  Our discussion has dwelt on usages which are at least to \nsome degree rhetorical and opportunistic in character, and which conjure a political scene \nheavily influenced by tactical calculation.  If it is in this guise that Left and Right find public \nexpression, rather than as devices for representing differences of principle, the possibility that \nthe categories become poisoned through negative association would seem real.  Should they \ncome to be associated mainly with acts of partisan positioning, with efforts to tar political \nopponents rather than to evoke meaningful differences, what uses would they then hold for \nthose of undecided political loyalties, perhaps for the majority of citizens? \nThe retreat of the Left-Right vocabulary into a small speech community of political \nelites is evidently one possible scenario.  Of these elites, perhaps only a subset of political \n\u2018mavericks\u2019 will be inclined to promote these terms consistently and positively, as anchor-\nterms for the political visions they wish to be associated with.  It is noticeable that the most \nexplicit act of self-positioning we have considered \u2013 that of the Linkspartei \u2013 is one made \nfrom the political margins, by a party with little invested in the status quo.  By contrast, in \nMandelson\u2019s text, and to a lesser extent in Brown\u2019s, Left and Right signify either mere \nlocations on an external landscape, or protagonists but protagonists to be opposed.  By \npolitical actors wishing to appear moderate and pragmatic, a principled invocation of the \nterms may be rare. \nIt is important to note though that even tactical usages of Left and Right are not \nnecessarily incompatible with the idea that Left and Right signal deeper commitments.  Some \nthat we have considered, such as the effort to evoke the seriousness of political clashes by \nsetting them in a larger cross-temporal context, seem predicated exactly on this idea.  \nLikewise Hannan\u2019s move to reconfigure the relations between Conservatives, Labour and the \nBNP, which draws its urgency from the notion that Left and Right are carriers of meaning \u2013 \nmeaning which may be dangerous if it is not nailed with precision.  The continued existence \n 23 \nof some level of stabilised semantic content going beyond the local application of the terms \nwould seem to be a prerequisite for these categories being useful political resources in such \nways.  And even when they are invoked for the most local of reasons, like concepts in \ngeneral they bring with them more meaning than the single speaker intends.  Left and Right \nremain categories of abstraction which invite the listener to look beyond the merely local, \nbeyond the here-and-now, to a larger temporal and spatial context.  To this extent the \nrelationship between the tactical usage of the terms and their more principled democratic role \nmay be more harmonious than initially appears. \n \n \n                                                          \n1\n Comments on an earlier draft were kindly offered by St\u00e9phane Baele, Anders Berg-S\u00f8rensen, Susan Boonman-\nBerson, Marco Dani, Peter Feindt, V\u00e9ronique Mottier, Gitte Sommer Harrits, Dvora Yanow, Lea Ypi, and \nfellow participants of the workshop on \u2018Category-Making and Public Policy\u2019 at the 2010 ECPR Joint Sessions \nin M\u00fcnster.

Note though that several Third Way texts are ambiguous in their attitude to Left and Right: see for \ninstance the Blair \/ Schroeder joint document in 1998 (Tony Blair and Gerhard Schroeder, Europe: The Third \nWay \/ Die Neue Mitte (London: Labour Party, 1999)), which begins by claiming the terms have lost their \nrelevance before going on to propose \u2018a new supply-side agenda for the Left\u2019.  (Such formulations seem \ndesigned to disrupt the conventional associations of \u2018Left\u2019, in this case with demand-side economics.)  On New \nLabour\u2019s inconsistency regarding whether the Third Way is \u2018beyond Left and Right\u2019 or just an updated Centre-\nLeft, see Stephen Driver and Luke Martell, \u2018Left, Right and the Third Way\u2019, Policy and Politics 28 (2) (2000). \n48\n Note that narratives concerning the demise of Left and Right can trade on the ambiguity regarding whether \nLeft and Right is a space defined by parties or by ideas (or currently-existing elite views vs the range of views \nin society, today and in the past).  Those suggesting the terms are no longer meaningful may try to infer from a \nlack of contestation on the current political scene that such contestation is no longer conceivable \u2013 a view which \nimplicates the world of ideas. \n49\n Brown, op. cit., Ref. 24. \n50\n Brown, ibid., p.5. \n51\n Anthony Giddens (ed.), The Progressive Manifesto (Cambridge: Polity, 2003). \n52\n Reporting Brown\u2019s use of \u2018progressive alliance\u2019, see Andrew Grice, The Independent, 21 April 2010: \nwww.independent.co.uk\/news\/uk\/politics\/brown-trains-his-sights-on-a-new-politics-ndash-with-the-help-of-the-\nlib-dems-1949585.html.   \n53\n As generally, adequacy is understood here in terms of usefulness for specific actors rather than wider political \ngoods, the latter being beyond the scope of this paper.   \n 27 \n                                                                                                                                                                                    \n54\n Cf.
