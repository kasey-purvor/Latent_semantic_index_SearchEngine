In\nparticular, it focuses on the impact of new technology on students' learning. An investigative study was\nundertaken using two cohorts of students taking modules supported by WWW pages. Two modules were\nselected. These were taught by the same lecturer but adopted distinctly different approaches to delivering\nmodule content via the WWW.

The study identified distinct differences in confidence in using the WWW\nand perceptions of its value for learning, between the two student cohorts. It is proposed that this is a\nreflection of the depth of material provided and the type of knowledge acquisition encouraged by the\ncontrasting styles of the WWW pages.\nIntroduction\nThe problem\nUniversities may invest millions of pounds in the provision of computer hardware without\never seriously considering the educational results such investment may deliver. Equally,\nacademics may be committed to the use of IT in teaching and learning because it is\nexpected of them (cf. Dearing, 1997), and rarely give serious consideration to the impact\nwhich the effective use of IT may have on student learning (Lauillard, 1993). The use of the\nWWW to deliver material in support of university teaching is still in its infancy, yet already\ntwo distinct approaches to its use can be seen. The first approach uses the WWW passively\nto deliver existing lecture notes in a technologically impressive and, perhaps more\nimportantly, highly convenient fashion. The second approach attempts to shape the\nmaterial delivered to maximize the teaching and learning potential of the WWW and to\ndevelop students' skills in the use of the medium. But which approach works more\neffectively? And how does one balance the needs of an academic community pressured by\nthe Research Assessment Exercise with the need to develop effective teaching and learning\n57\nJulia Meek et al Evaluating the impact of Internet provision on students' information-gathering strategies\nstrategies which maximize the potential of IT for the academic community, for the students\nand for their future employers?\nThe context\nNew technology is changing the way information is stored and transmitted. This has\nimplications for both the skills which higher education needs to develop and the way in\nwhich it is delivered. (Dearing, 1997, para 20)\nThe range of high-quality material now available on the WWW, and the increasing ease of\nuse of HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML) to stage material on the WWW, make it\nimperative that the potential of this medium is exploited (Whalley, 1995). However, the\nstudent must be exposed to the technology in a meaningful and stimulating way if learning\nand confidence in using IT are to be encouraged (Brown and Williams, 1995), and if\nessential IT skills are to pass from the academic to the wider community (Mumford, 1995).\nUse of the W W W as a medium for teaching: a case study\nThe Internet is an excellent vehicle for teaching and learning in the area of geological and\nenvironmental issues (Newnham et al, in press). Particular advantages are the immediacy\nand quality of resources which the WWW offers on particular subjects such as volcanic\nactivity and geohazards which include floods, earthquakes and landslides. A challenge\nwhen teaching such subject areas is to make students realize that volcanic activity and\ngeohazards occur around the world all the time. However, it is difficult to communicate\nthat immediacy when relevant literature may not reach the Library shelves until three or\nmore years after an event, and newspaper coverage is regionally and culturally biased.\nIntelligent use of the WWW offers an ability to monitor developing situations and to\nobtain data and images of hazards as they occur, thereby stimulating the students'\nperception of the world and developing and challenging their information-gathering\nstrategies (Grattan, 1995).\nAims and objectives\nThe aims for introducing the WWW as a medium for teaching in the Institute of\nGeography and Earth Studies were to:\n\u2022 communicate essential information in a cost-effective way (green learning);\n\u2022 economize staff time in teaching-administration;\n\u2022 encourage students to use the WWW to explore related issues;\n\u2022 develop students' transferable skills in the use of Communication and Information\nTechnologies (C&IT).\nThe objectives were to:\n\u2022 develop a sophisticated and versatile teaching resource;\n\u2022 motivate students, and encourage them to take an innovative approach to their work.\nStructure of the Web pages\nThe structure of the WWW pages was similar in the delivery of basic 'housekeeping'\nsuch as lecture themes, assessment details, outline of essential reading etc. (see\n58\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\nhttp:\/\/www.aber.ac.uk\/~jpg\/johng.html), but the depth of the material provided in support\nof the modules was distinctly different.\nVolcanic Activity. Each lecture theme for Volcanic Activity was supported by extremely\ndetailed notes, often in excess of 8,000 words of text which were designed to relieve\npressure on Library resources, and to ensure that each student had access to relevant\nliterature. Assessment was via conventional essay and examination. Pre-selected WWW\nresources were listed on a separate page. Students were encouraged to use the WWW as a\nresource for learning, but practical sessions were not incorporated into the module\ntimetable.\nGeohazards. In contrast, the WWW page which supported Geohazards contained outline\nlecture notes which incorporated references to relevant WWW resources. Assessment was\nvia a team-produced project which required students to make extensive use of the WWW,\nand by a seminar presentation and an examination. The project teams were encouraged to\nproduce a WWW page to support their written report, although this was not compulsory.\nA weekly practical WWW session was timetabled into the module. These practical sessions\ntaught the students how to navigate the WWW and construct their own Web pages.\nIn summary, the rationale behind the two styles of Web pages was distinctly different. The\npages which supported Volcanic Activity were constructed to facilitate the delivery of\nmaterial produced by the lecturer, and students' use of the medium was essentially passive.\nIn contrast, the pages which supported Geohazards were designed to encourage students to\nuse the medium as an integral part of their learning.\nInvestigative study\nHow were the two different styles of WWW pages used and viewed by the students? It\nwould be comforting to believe that whatever their style, students would be able to use the\nWWW pages effectively and confidently to support their learning. The different design of\nthe two sets of pages provided the opportunity to investigate this supposition.\nThe broad objectives of the investigation were to:\n\u2022 conduct a pilot study which would form the basis for future in-depth studies;\n\u2022 assess the impact of new technology on students' learning;\n\u2022 assess students' confidence in using new technology;\n\u2022 see how students' patterns of working differed, i.e. which resources (books, journals,\nWWW) they were using.\nA series of questionnaires were used which were quick and easy to administer within\nlectures. Pre- and mid-semester questionnaires, were distributed to track changes in\nbehaviour and attitudes as the modules progressed. The questionnaires focused on\nstudents' levels of confidence in using IT tools, their use of various information-gathering\nsources, and their views on how effective they felt a particular source was in assisting their\nlearning. Some questions required students to rank responses, others required students to\nprovide ratings (using a 5-point Likert Scale), and the remainder required qualitative\nreplies.\n59\nJulia Meek et ol Evaluating the impact of Internet provision on students' information-gathering strategies\nAnalysis of results\nConfidence in using IT\nIn the pre-module questionnaire, 95 per cent of students in Volcanic Activity and 100 per\ncent of those in Geohazards noted a high level of confidence in their use of email. Most\nstudents in Volcanic Activity also noted a high level of confidence in their use of the\nWWW, although slightly less of those in Geohazards felt confident in their use of the\nWWW. See Table 1.\nEmail\nWWW\nQuestion: How confident are you\nVolcanic Activity\n95%\n95%\nin your use of:\nGeohazards\n100%\n74%\nTable I. Pre-module questionnaire ratings of 4 (fairly confident) or 5 (very confident)\nThe mid-module questionnaire in Volcanic Activity suggested that the majority of\nstudents' confidence in the use of email had remained about the same. However, their\nconfidence in using the WWW had, overall, gone down. In the Geohazards cohort,\nconfidence in the use of email had remained constant but, overall, there had been an\nincrease in confidence in using the WWW. See Table 2.\nEmail\nWWW\nQuestion: How confident are you\nVolcanic Activity\n90%\n85%\nin your use of:\nGeohazards\n96%\n85% .\nTable 2. Mid-module questionnaire ratings of 4 (fairly confident) or 5 (very confident)\nIt is possible that this trend may be explained by the active support and encouragement\nwhich the student cohort taking Geohazards received. In contrast, Volcanic Activity\nstudents were presented with the WWW resource and expected to use it as they would any\nother information source such as the Library. However, it is interesting to note that\nalthough 20 per cent of Volcanic Activity students were initially more confident in using\nthe WWW than Geohazards students, the two cohorts had the same overall level of\nconfidence mid-way through their modules. This trend will be the subject of further\nresearch.\nFrequency of use of information sources\nStudents taking the Volcanic Activity module used journals most frequently, whereas\nstudents on Geohazards used books most frequently. Both cohorts reported an increase in\nthe frequency with which they used the WWW mid-way through the modules. However,\nthe use of the WWW as a data source was not transferred to modules where the lecturer\n60\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\ndid not provide a basic WWW resource as a starting point. Indeed, an apparent trend in\nthis data is that the students surveyed appeared to require pro-active encouragement to\npromote active and intelligent use of the WWW as a resource on a module-by-module\nbasis.\nQualitative judgements were sought to explain students' choice of information sources.\nThe following illustrate the most common responses:\n\u2022 Books = out of date very quickly but good for general background;\n\u2022 Journals = up to date; detailed articles; know they are relevant because on the reading list;\n\u2022 WWW = up-to-date information but very slow to use; hard to know which sources are\nrelevant\/reliable as they are not refereed.\nEffective learning\nIt is apparent that student's perception of the WWW as an effective learning tool altered\nsubstantially within the Geohazards cohort, but remained static within the Volcanic\nActivity cohort. This could be because students on the Geohazards course had a better\nunderstanding of the WWW as they used it in a more structured, integrated way and could\nsee the benefits, rather than using it passively to collect pre-prepared bundles of lecture\nnotes. See Table 3.\nQuestion: How do you rate the WWW as an effective learning tool?\nVolcanic Activity Geohazards\nPre-module 71% 69%\nMid-module 71% 93%\nTable 3. Mid-module questionnaire ratings of 4 (fairly confident) or 5 (very confident)\nReflections and conclusions\nIf the primary educational purpose of the WWW is to provide an information source to\nsupport students' learning, it is clear that the WWW pages supporting the Geohazards\nmodule were more successful than those supporting Volcanic Activity. A total of 93 per\ncent of students in Geohazards rated the WWW as an effective learning tool compared with\n71 per cent in Volcanic Activity. In addition, students' confidence in using the WWW had\nclearly increased in Geohazards, although it had decreased for students in Volcanic Activity.\nThe reasons for this may lie in the passive approach adopted in the Volcanic Activity\nmodule as opposed to the active use of resources encouraged in Geohazards.\nIn the Volcanic Activity module, where extremely detailed lecture notes were available and\nwhere assessment was very conventional, students were appreciative of the convenience\noffered by the WWW, but their motivation to attend lectures fell as they relied on lecture\nnotes available on the WWW. In contrast, the WWW pages supporting Geohazards\ncontained outline notes and reference to relevant WWW resources. Students were\nsupported in their use of the WWW and were taught to construct Web pages.\nConsequently, they remained keen and motivated. Approximately 40 per cent of the\n61\nJulia Meek et o\/ Evaluating the impact of Internet provision on students' information-gathering strategies\nGeohazards project groups voluntarily produced Web pages to support their project\n(http:\/\/www.aber.ac.uk\/~jpg\/hazards\/studenthazards), and one group of students opted to\nuse Micrososft PowerPoint for their presentation, thus illustrating an increased confidence\nin using IT tools. It was generally noted that a great deal of visual material from the WWW\nappeared in student projects.\nIt is plain from this study carried out at the University of Wales Aberystwyth, that as in\nother teaching and learning exercises, it is not enough simply to use new technology with\ntraditional teaching and learning methods. Passive learning is as unsuccessful when\ndelivered by new technology as when it is delivered by chalk and blackboard.\nLecturer's reflections\nThe lecturer involved (and one of the authors of this paper), John Grattan, felt that using\nthe WWW as a tool for teaching and learning had been successful in Geohazards. It had\nenabled students to explore the themes and issues in an active manner, and students were\nkeen and motivated about creating Web pages. Unfortunately, the Volcanic Activity module\nhad been less successful in that the passive delivery of reading material via electronic\nmeans appears to be essentially as ineffective as any other style of passive learning.\nThe future\nChanges to the Web pages\nIt is intended that the style of the Volcanic Activity WWW pages will be changed so that\nstudents receive outline notes with direction to relevant resources. The existing detailed\nnotes will still be available periodically for revision purposes, but students will not be able\nto rely on them throughout the semester. The pages will be constructed to encourage\nstudents to use them as exploratory tools rather than simply to provide dense information.\nAdditional resources will also be provided in Geohazards.\nSupport\nA recurring comment from students using the WWW was that they were often unsure of\nthe validity and reliability of resources. Grattan plans to address this problem by giving a\nbrief talk on the quality of information on the WWW. Although he currently only makes\nlinks to sites he feels are of academic value, these in turn have links to other sites which\nmay have material of less academic value.\nThe Institute of Geography and Earth Sciences at the University of Wales Aberystwyth\nhas now appointed a technician with the specific job description of supporting teaching\nand learning initiatives within the Institute. This will provide much needed assistance and\nencouragement to academic staff.\nAssessment\nGrattan plans to modify the assessment such that students can choose to submit either a\nwritten project or WWW pages. Both types of assessment will be marked using the same\ncriteria, i.e. structure; depth of analysis, etc.\nEvaluation\nThis paper represents the findings from the first year of an on-going study. The results of\nthis initial study have identified some interesting trends which need to be investigated\n62\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\nfurther next year. In particular, future research will focus on what makes learning through\nthe WWW effective, for example page design, types of links, support and training for\nstudents. Student responses will also be queried in greater depth to find out what they\nthemselves mean by 'effective'?\nReferences\nBrown, P. and Williams, G.
