The shifting\nlocus of innovation and value creation away from the \u2018sole firm as innovator\u2019 poses\nimportant questions about the nature of resources that exist in the spaces between\nfirms, and the capabilities needed to leverage them for competitive advantage. The\npurpose of this research is to produce design-oriented knowledge, for configuring\ninterorganizational networks as a means of accessing such resources for innovation.\nMethodology \/ Approach \u2013 This exploratory investigation conflates emerging\nconstructs and themes analytically induced from a systematic survey of 142 scholarly\nand practitioner articles and 45 expert interviews with senior professionals operating\nin the biopharmaceuticals industry. Findings and Practical Implications \u2013 The\nfindings identify 7 theoretically and empirically grounded technological rules\nassociated with effective interorganizational networking for innovation. They\nembody evidence ex post of networking theory and practice. Based on van Aken\u2019s\nseminal work, they comprise vital design-oriented knowledge to provide a solution\narchitecture of viable action options for managers, a priori, to purposefully design\ninnovation networks. Collectively these rules represent a tentative taxonomy, a means\nof classifying design principles, to assist managers in navigating their decision\nmaking processes. Originality\/value of paper - This study demonstrates the need\nfor explicit design-oriented knowledge for configuring interorganizational networks.\nFinally, the implications of the findings for strategic management theory are discussed\nfrom a Dynamic Capabilities view. The significance of a dynamic capability which\naddresses the renewal of network-specific resources is highlighted.\nKeywords: Interorganizational Networks, Innovation, Resource-based View,\nDynamic Capabilities View, Biopharmaceuticals\nPaper Category: Research Paper\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n3\nIntroduction\nCompetitive global businesses environments remain congruent with Eisenhart\u2019s\n(1989) notion of high velocity and D\u2019Aveni\u2019s (1994) concept of hyper competition, in\nwhich technological innovations are frequent and potentially path breaking. Under\nsuch dynamic conditions, the effective renewal of products\/services and how they are\ndelivered are critical capabilities for many high tech industries (Bartlett and Ghoshal,\n2002; Zahra and Nielsen, 2002; Lovas and Ghoshal, 2000; Markides and Geroski,\n2003 and Bessant, 2003). This is a major concern for the traditional pharmaceuticals\nand emerging biopharmaceuticals sector where advancements in the field of\ngenomics, proteomics, bioinformatics and biotechnology are increasingly of a\ndiscontinuous nature. Thus making the development of innovative medicines a risky\nand expensive process that demands organizational capabilities conducive to radical\ninnovation.\nResearch is beginning to illustrate how relatively novel organizational forms such as\n\u2018networks\u2019 are being deployed to access new technologies and their associated know-\nhow to improve innovation capacity (George et al, 2002, Hagedoorn and Duysters,\n2002). Such opportunities to exploit superior external knowledge resources often\ncome with the promise of new products for new markets. The use of innovation\nnetworks has become a distinctive feature of the rapidly growing biopharmaceuticals\nsector. Liesband et al (1996) in their study of New Biotechnology Firms (NBF)\nconsider three organizational options for sourcing scientific knowledge: internal\nsourcing via internal hierarchies, external sourcing through markets exchanges and\nexternal sourcing through organizational networks. Granovetter (1985) and Powell\n(1998) provide a critique of the traditional hierarchies and markets viewpoint in\nsuggesting that, its use does not acknowledge the importance of the social dimension\nas a means of governing business exchange, which is often predicated on trust. Tidd\n(1995) points out that whilst the network concept appears relatively novel and able to\novercome the \u2018market vs. hierarchies\u2019 debate, as a so-called \u2018third way\u2019, it is echoed\nin earlier research by Rumelt in the 1970s and Rothwell\u2019s (1994) Fifth Generation\nmodel of innovation. More recently, Chesbrough\u2019s notion of Open Innovation and\nBessant\u2019s (2004) idea of High Involvement Innovation also replay similar generic\narguments regarding the use of networks and confirm their potential to create new\nvalue. Coombs & Metcalfe\u2019s (2002) argue that whilst the pharmaceutical sector has\ntraditionally enjoyed considerable organic growth as a result of their patents,\nintellectual property, technologies, marketing and production capabilities, today\u2019s\ncompetitive environment is demanding fundamental changes to the way they do\nbusiness. In particular, Coombs & Metcalfe are intrigued by way in which these firms\nhave avoided a reliance on external expertise in the face of new biotechnological\nadvancements, and how in recent years this climate has forced them to combine,\nreconfigure, integrate and coordinate resources within what they have termed a\n\u2018distributed innovation system\u2019.\nA Dynamic Capabilities View of Biopharmaceuticals Product Development\nBiopharmaceutical product development is reliant on complementary resources\nbestowed by different organizations in a wider network, which is often globally\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n4\ndispersed. Such networks may include universities, clinical research organizations\n(CRO), pharmaceuticals companies; small genomics research laboratories,\nindependent financiers, proprietary technology providers and other new biotechnology\nfirms (NBFs). The pooling effect of resources as an organizational level activity has\nbeen portrayed in other high tech industries (Hankasson, 1990) as a \u2018network\napproach\u2019 to innovation (Bower, 1993). Unlike other approaches (e.g. resource\ndependency, transaction cost and agency) it seeks to understand how the focal firm\nand its peripheries change the multi-player (or network) context through their\ninteractions. Such new industry settings are shifting the locus of knowledge, learning\nand value creation beyond the boundary of the single firm and into the network, with\nimportant implications for its future management and organization.\nThe Resource Based View (RBV) of the firm is a useful theoretical framework for\nunderstanding how such dynamics lead to competitive advantage (Barney, 1991;\nNelson, 1991; Penrose, 1959; Prahalad and Hamel, 1990; Teece et al, 1997). As a\nprogressively dominant theoretical view in the field of strategic management, it\nconcerns itself with resources as being critical to a firm\u2019s competitive advantage and\nlong-term survival. Whilst importance is attached to all physical and organizational\nresources, special reference is made to knowledge and competencies based resources.\nIn connecting the RBV to dynamic market environments more closely, Teece et al\n(1997) discuss the notion of \u2018dynamic capabilities\u2019 through which managers\n\u2018integrate, build and reconfigure internal and external competencies to address\nchanging environments\u2019 (Teece et al 1997). As a body of knowledge that has\nprogressed rapidly over the last few decades it explores the nature of such capabilities,\nand their distinguishing characteristics. A main thrust of this literature argues that\ndynamic capabilities are essentially organizational routines deployed to alter a\nresource base by \u2018acquiring, creating, shedding, integrating, and recombining existing\nresources to generate new value creating strategies\u2019 (Pisano, 1996). Whilst the\nfunctionality of dynamics capabilities is generic and applicable across business\ncontexts, their value lies in the resource configurations they create and not in the\ncapabilities themselves (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000).\nLike Preim and Butler (2001) in their recent portrayal of the limitations of Barney\u2019s\nRBV, Eisenhardt and Martin (2000) suggest that the RBV misjudges the locus of\nlong-term competitive advantage in dynamic markets. In considering this suggestion\nin the context of biopharmaceutical new product development (biopharma NPD), the\nprevailing industry dynamics are shifting the locus of knowledge and value creation\nwithin the supply and demand chains. Therefore it seems plausible to propose that\ninnovation, and hence competitive advantage, cannot be simply manipulated from\nwithin the boundary of a single firm, as presumed by a traditional RBV perspective,\nbut rather from within a network of heterogeneous firms. This poses questions\nconcerning the nature of resources that exist in the space between firms and how they\nare leveraged. Such inquiries are relevant to operationalizing interorganizational\ninnovation networks effectively, a topic which to date has witnessed a significant lack\nof management research to produce design-oriented knowledge. This research\ndeploys van Aken\u2019s seminal ideas of generating design-oriented knowledge through\nthe development of what he calls \u2018grounded and field-tested technological rules\u2019 (van\nAken, 2005).\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n5\nThis paper presents 7 empirically and theoretically grounded technological rules\nassociated with effective interorganizational networking for innovation. These rules\nembody evidence ex post of networking theory and practice. In doing so, the rules\ncompose vital design-oriented knowledge which provides solution architecture of\nviable action options for managers a priori, to purposefully design innovation\nnetworks. Collectively these rules represent a tentative taxonomy, a means of\nclassifying design principles, to assist managers in navigating their decision making\nprocesses and devising appropriate network development strategies. It acts as a useful\nframework for evaluating current managerial practice and considering the range of\npossibilities available to guide future action. In doing so, it constitutes valuable\ntransferable knowledge to support improvements in innovation capacity and\nperformance. The investigation conflates emerging constructs and themes\nanalytically induced from a systematic survey of 142 scholarly articles and 45 expert\ninterviews with senior professionals in the burgeoning global biopharmaceuticals\nsector. The resultant synthesis is recommended for further field-testing, as an\nimportant antecedent to management action to better inform the broader practice of\nmanaging innovation in an increasingly multi-player (or network) context. The\nmanagerial implications of each rule associated with designing innovation networks\nare considered. Finally, the strategic management propositions of the research have\nbeen discussed from a Dynamic Capabilities view, and in particular its failure to\nadequately address capabilities associated with the renewal of network-specific\nresources.\nMethods\nThis research adopts van Aken\u2019s (2005) eloquent diagnosis of the discipline of\nmanagement as a \u2018design science\u2019 (similar to medicine and engineering) to be distinct\nfrom the \u2018explanatory\u2019 sciences (similar to physics, chemistry and biology). He\nsuggests the science of management is primarily concerned with the need to produce\ndesign-oriented knowledge via \u2018grounded and field tested technological rules\u2019 based\non Bunge\u2019s notion of \u2018technological rules\u2019 (1967). van Aken (2005) advocates the\nview that field testing these rules in the real world enables descriptive knowledge to\nbe applied, and transformed into actionable design knowledge. This design\nknowledge provides a solution architecture composing viable action options for\nmanagers, and so an important antecedent to management practice.\nAs a leading researcher in the field of innovation management van Aken is a prolific\nsupporter of research conducted within the framework of a Mode 2 knowledge\nproduction system, and \u2018in the context of application\u2019 (Gibbons et al, 1994; Huff,\n2000; Nowotny et al, 2001). Mode 2 research is multidisciplinary and seeks to solve\ncomplex and relevant problems in the field, as distinct from Mode 1 research which is\noften disciplinary and drives further research enquiry, as often evident in the natural\nsciences.\nThis study upholds innovation management as a branch of management research and\ncorroborates van Aken views that richness can be gained through combining both\nmode 1 and mode 2 strategies. In doing so, quantitative and qualitative data from two\ncomplementary research phases deploying Systematic Review (SR) and empirical\nsemi-structured interviews are conflated. The resultant synthesis of 7 empirically and\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n6\ntheoretically grounded technological rules is recommended for further field-testing.\nThe following sections describe each of the research phases.\nSample and Procedure\nPhase 1: Systematic Review\nAn extensive Systematic Review (SR) of the extant literature sought to identify key\nconstructs influencing effective interorganizational networking practice. The SR\nadopts an evidenced based approach to assimilating secondary data using peer review\nand formalized criteria, based on its principal use in the medical field. It has a defined\nprotocol designed to provide a transparency and auditability based on Tranfield et al\n(2003) as follows:\n\uf0b7 An initial investigation of the ABI Proquest database was undertaken through\nsearch strings using the keywords in table 1. This as conducted within a select list\nof international scholarly and practitioner journals in the management science\nfield. The search resulted in a total of more than 1500 articles, from which 142\narticles were selected for further review based on specific inclusion\/exclusion\ncriteria set in accordance with the research aims and objectives. A sector focus\nwas imposed to include management research in the pharmaceuticals,\nbiotechnology and biopharmaceuticals domains.\n\uf0b7 A database of the included 142 articles formed an \u2018A\u2019 list for subsequent\nquantitative and qualitative analysis.\n\uf0b7 The \u2018A\u2019 list was initially subject to demographic analysis to gauge deeper\nunderstanding of the nature and form of the dataset.\n\uf0b7 Summaries of the \u2018A\u2019 list articles were transferred onto data recording sheets for\nsubsequent theme based content analysis, open coding and generation of higher\norder themes.\n\uf0b7 A synthesis of this extant literature led to emergence of major constructs which\nwere subsequently conflated with phase 2 of the study.\nTable 1: Systematic Review: Keywords\n\u2018Keywords\u2019 for search string formation\nsocial capital\ninnovation network\ninnovation AND network\nnetwork* AND (pharma* OR biotech*)\nStrategic alliance* AND (pharma* OR biotech*)\nTotal number of articles reviewed 142\nPhase 2: Empirical study\nThe aim of this exploratory investigation was to gain novel insights into the growing\npractice of interorganizational innovation. Therefore 45 semi-structured interviews\nwith senior professionals in the biopharmaceuticals field were conducted, initially to\nexamine major shifts in management practice regarding:\n\uf0b7 biopharma NPD over the past 20 years\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n7\n\uf0b7 interorganizational innovation as an explicit NPD strategy\n\uf0b7 enablers and barriers to implementing effective interorganizational innovation\n\uf0b7 how drug development specialists acquire new sources of knowledge\n\uf0b7 current and future challenges facing drug development firms\n\uf0b7 support for the future of biopharma NPD\nThis exploratory approach relies heavily on analytical induction which does not require\nprobability based sampling techniques, because an important aim of the study is to generate\nfurther avenues of research inquiry (Yin, 2003). The research sample, shown in table 2, was\nselected using a modified \u2018snowballing\u2019 technique (Miles & Huberman, 1994), whereby the\ninitial informants were identified by the research partners, for their high profile\nresponsibilities across organizational and disciplinary boundaries in a biopharma NPD\ncontext.\nTable 2 The Sample of Respondents\nType of firm No. of\nfirms\nNo. of\ninterviews\nExemplar informants\nBig\nPharmaceuticals\n4 12 Vice President Biology, Head of Bioinformatics, R&D\nManager, Manager, Capacity & Resource Planning\nBiotechnology 3 10 Head of Drug Discovery , Vice President, Strategic\nAlliances, Vice President Sales\nLife Sciences\nConsultancy\n4 10 Associate Partner, Director Pharmaceuticals R&D,\nPrincipal Managing Consultant, Group Head\nPharmaceuticals R&D Europe\nBiotechnology\nProfessional\nAssociation\n2 4 CEO BioIndustry Association (UK), Director of\nBioprocess UK, Business Development Director, CEO\nRegional Biotechnology Initiative\nAcademic\nInstitutions\n6 9 Professor, Senior Lecturer, Senior Researchers\nTotal 19 45\nThe interviews ranged from between 45 minutes to 3 hours in duration, and where possible\ntape recorded for subsequent transcription. In the small number of cases where consent for\ntape recording was not forthcoming, detailed notes were made during and after the interview.\nThe transcriptions and notes generated a substantial dataset for qualitative analysis. A process\nof analytical induction using Theme Based Content Analysis (TBCA) revealed 6 second order\nthemes induced from 34 first order open codes. Generic themes materialized through the\nexpansion and contraction of key constructs, based on coding instances within the\npersonalized accounts of interviewees, which further refined the clustering process. In\naddition to this, corporate documentation and other archival records were also included for\nanalysis where available.\nFindings\nPhase 1: Systematic Review\nThe Systematic Review (SR) protocol identified 10 key constructs influencing\neffective interorganizational networking practice for innovation, from the extant\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n8\nliterature. Table 3 incorporates these constructs as a theoretical framework, and the\noutcome of a process of qualitative induction. Each of these constructs is briefly\ndiscussed in the following sections and subsequently conflated with the findings of\nthe empirical study.\nThe full \u2018A\u2019 list of 142 articles shows a relatively even split of European, UK and US\npublished items. Furthermore 102 of these items were empirically based, 15\npresented explicit design guidance in relation to innovation networks and whilst 77\nupheld a strong knowledge based view, only 10 discussed the research findings from a\nDynamic Capabilities view.\nTable 3: Theoretical framework\nKey constructs influencing effective interorganizational networking\npractice for innovation\nNumber of\ncitations\nPercentage\n%\nDynamic view 14 4\nProcess and structure 63 16\nUnintended consequences 20 5\nHeterogeneity 48 12\nOpenness and security 44 11\nConnectivity 52 13\nLearning and knowledge transfer 43 11\nRelationship management 49 13\nContinuous and discontinuous renewal 30 8\nComplexity and embeddedness 26 7\nDynamic view\nA significant proportion of the literature discusses the use of networks and learning\nfrom a dynamic view that illustrates the changing nature of organizational ties over\ntime. Networks are considered from an evolutionary life cycle perspective with\ndifferent phases of development which happen over a period of time (Pyka & Saviotti,\n2001; Kreiner & Schultz, 1993). For example, there is usually an initiation phase,\ngrowth phase, stability phase and then a maturity phase, whereby the network might\nspur new connections or perhaps the existing connections might become dormant,\nonly to be rejuvenated with a change in context at a later point in time. The\ndimension of time acknowledges that whilst a network may have a life span,\nindividual connections are not necessarily product or network development phase-\nspecific and will eventually develop their own history and path dependencies\n(Orsenigo et al, 2001 and Powell et al, 1996). Learning in networks is enhanced due\nto firm\u2019s increased opportunities to access new sources of knowledge through a\nvariety of external linkages. Therefore networked firms are conducive to developing\ntheir capacity to absorb knowledge from external sources (i.e. absorptive capacity)\nand organizational routines for doing so (i.e. collaborative capacity).\nStructure and process\nThe outcomes of network organizational arrangements can be enhanced, if both the\nwider network and specific network connections are actively managed and structured\nfrom initial inception to end-of-life (Pittaway et al, 2004). Whilst an active\nmanagement approach engenders formality, it is prudent to overtly facilitate the\nconditions conducive to releasing the potential benefits often associated with the\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n9\ninformal nature of networks. For example, Bessant et al (2001) in their study of\nsupply, innovation and learning networks articulate a framework of 8 generic\nprocesses for actively managing network dynamics based on the work by Gandori and\nSoda (1995). These include network creation, decision-making, conflict resolution,\ninformation processing, knowledge capture, integration, risk\/benefit sharing as\nexplicit processes to be managed.\nUnintended consequences\nNetworks have emergent properties and creating conditions to foster serendipity can\nbe advantageous in achieving both intended and non-intended outcomes. A good start\nmight be to positively encourage social networking through planned attendances at\nvarious business conferences, industry forums etc., with a view of using this platform\nto promote formal partnering (Kreiner & Schultz, 1993). It is important to realize that\nthe foundation of effective networks will also emerge informally over time, but then a\nrepertoire of processes need to be undertaken which follows an incremental and\nsequential transition from loose conversations and discussions to defined contractual\nobligations (Powell, 1998; Oliver & Liebeskind, 1998). Managers in their role as\n\u2018network architects\u2019 must recognize that there are opportunities to capitalize upon the\nemergent properties of network dynamics. This may require significant investments\nin time and other resources to build professional trust, respect and loyalty amongst\nvarious networked firms, with a view to this being a sound basis for future exchange.\nHeterogeneity\nOrganizational networks in the biopharmaceuticals sector are becoming diverse as\nfirms recognize that future sources of innovation lie beyond the boundary of the firm.\nNetwork building strategies are being shaped by the increasing specialisation and\nfragmentation of scientific and technological knowledge in this sector\u2019s quest for\ncomplementarities and synergies between the offerings of different firms. This is of\ncourse leading to greater dependencies and integration of disciplines across firm\nboundaries in an interactive innovation system (Swan et al, 2004). Diverse inputs\nfrom within the network contribute towards creative exploration and the effective\nexploitation of ideas, which subsequently improve the outcomes achieved for the\namount of resources invested (Oliver, 2004; Murray, 2004; Powell et al, 1996). One\nway to achieve heterogeneity within a network is for organizations to gain preferred\npartner status within the sector communities (Dyer et al, 2001). Having a reputation\nwhich attracts a plentiful of partners allows firms to exercise sufficient choice in\nselecting collaborators, and achieve higher levels of network involvement and access\nto a diverse and rich knowledge base (Powell, 1998 and Florida et al, 2003).\nOpenness and security\nFirms operating in networks may experience a level of insecurity arising from\nknowledge sharing activities, which carry potential risks to their IPR. The\nmismanagement of such tensions can impose limitations on the amount of learning\nthat might take place amongst network partners (Owen-Smith & Powell, 2004;\nGargiulo & Benassi, 2000). Whilst the benefits of \u2018openness\u2019 and reaching outside\nfirm boundaries can not be over-emphasized (Burt, 1997; 1992), a degree of caution\nand \u2018closure\u2019 also needs to be exercised (Coleman, 1990; 1998). Consequently,\nnetworked firms will often devise mechanisms to ensure an appropriate level of\nsecurity and closure, particularly if their interactions are due to exploitative activity\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n10\ne.g. memorandum of understanding, consortium agreements, legal and non-disclosure\nagreements, exclusive licensing contracts, version control or proprietary access etc.\nConnectivity\nHuman connectivity that can be augmented through digital connectivity (internet and\nintranet) and its ancillary developments such as e-mail, file transfer protocol, user\ngenerated collaborative cyber workspaces, social networking software, video\/web-\nconferencing etc, can deliver knowledge advantages (Belussi and Arcangeli, 1998).\nGood connectivity or heavyweight membership of a network often results in firms\noccupying multiple locations in a wider network. This high involvement strategy can\nlead to other intangible benefits such as enhanced professional profile and reputation.\nIn addition, it may also result in increased adjacency to multiple channels of\nknowledge flow, enabling swift navigation through a diverse resource base (Kostova\n& Roth, 2003; Prusak & Lesser, 1999). Such high involvement can often be a largely\nbridging activity across what Burt (1992) calls \u2018structural holes\u2019 in networks, and\nneeds to be complemented with sufficient bonding level activity to foster communities\nof practice (CoP). This process of communalization will embed social structures in\nCoPs, often predicated on trust, which becomes an important coordination mechanism\nwithin interorganizational networks.\nLearning and knowledge transfer\nNetworks can benefit from engendering a dual approach to knowledge transfer in\nwhich learning is pursued in a both responsive and proactive manner. Therefore the\nsharing of experiences between networked firms through the exchange of dialogue as\na means of knowledge diffusion (Prusak & Cohen, 2001; Powell, 1998) is very much\nencouraged. The further construction of systematic measures (for e.g. may include\nco-publications and co-patenting) to diffuse the learning within networks is also\nstrongly advocated (Owen-Smith & Powell, 2003; Murray, 2004; Orsenigo et al,\n2001; Powell, 1998 and Powell et al, 1996). In doing so the network is able to\nendorse the view of \u2018learning as participation\u2019 and a kin to CoPs, as separate from the\nview \u2018learning as acquisition\u2019 (Yli-Renko, Autio & Sapieza, 2001).\nRelationship management\nNetworked organizations can improve innovation outcomes by increasing relational\nstrength (Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998) by promoting trust and flexibility through low\nlevels of prescription. This for example means having shared norms, values,\nobligations and expectations which facilitate benevolence leading to achieving the\nintended outcomes (Adler & Kwon; 2002; Bolino, Turnley & Bloodgood; 2002). In\nterms of enhancing flexibility, trusting relationships encourage informal monitoring\nand a reduced reliance on formal governance mechanisms with high levels of\nprescription (Barney & Hansen, 1994). Networks with high degree of relational\nstrength can engender a high reliability organization with improved levels of\nredundancy for greater flexibility and responsiveness to changing demands (Smart et\nal, 2003; Newell, Tansley & Huang, 2004).\nContinuous and discontinuous renewal\nNetworks are not static structures and as connections continually evolve, the resource\npool in the network is renewed through the multiplicity of collaborating arrangements\nongoing (Cross, Borgatti & Parker, 2002). We can deploy the term \u2018ambidextrous\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n11\ninnovation\u2019- the simultaneous pursuit of both incremental and discontinuous change\n(O'Reilly III Tushman, 2004; Tushman and O'Reilly III, 1996) to describe the need\nfor firms in networks to be linked in a multifaceted capacity. For example, firms\ninvolved in networks to explore specific know-how must also be cognizant of the\npotential to exploit existing capabilities within the same or different relationship. We\nuse the term \u2018Explo-ti-ring\u2019- exploiting existing capabilities and exploring new\nopportunities (Uzzi & Lancaster, 2003) to describe this phenomenon. Simple being\naware of these notions allows networked firms to make more informed and strategic\ndecisions about how to best apportion their R&D investments.\nComplexity and embeddedness\nComplexity in the biopharmaceuticals sector often implies escalating advances in\nscience and technology which demand firms to be part of a wider network to explore,\nunderstand, learn and exploit the underpinning knowledge (Owen-Smith et al, 2002;\nPyka, 2002; Frenken, 2000). Another dimension to complexity is that of structural\ncomplexity, occurring due to the inevitable embeddedness and nesting of different\nnetworks, further complicated by the various path dependencies of firms (Gulati,\nNohria & Zaheer, 2000; Stevenson & Greenberg, 2000). Essentially the key concern\nfor networked firms is how to navigate from within these structures, the relevant\nlearning and knowledge which has been generated (Powell, 1998). In such\ncircumstances considering a firm\u2019s connections as a strategic portfolio of\ncollaborations, that can be manipulated to identify knowledge and technology\ncomplementarities or synergies within a network, could be beneficial.\nPhase 2: Empirical study - expert semi-structured interviews\nTable 4 (see Appendix 1) presents a scattergram which summarizes the Theme Based\nContent Analysis (TBCA) of the 45 expert interviews, and consisted of transcripts,\ndetailed notes, corporate documentation and other archival records. It illustrates a\nrange of emerging themes and related sub-themes, indicative of the macro and micro\nlevel considerations informing management practices linked with interorganizational\ninnovation.\nThe theoretical framework of 10 key constructs derived from the SR process was used\nas an analytical lens to further investigate the empirical data and conflate the studies.\nThe resultant synthesis identified 7 theoretically and empirically grounded\ntechnological rules associated with effective interorganizational networking for\ninnovation. They embody evidence ex post of networking theory and practice. In\ndoing so, the rules compose vital design-oriented knowledge which provides a\nsolution architecture of viable action options for managers a priori, to purposefully\ndesign innovation networks. The rules are presented in table 5 and further field-\ntesting through application is recommended as an important antecedent to future\nmanagement action.\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n12\nTable 5: Emerging Technological Rules\n10 Constructs\nSys.

They also confirmed the widespread\naspirations and practice of interorganizational innovation, as a viable strategy for\nlong-term competitive advantage by creating new value through the combination and\nexchange of knowledge resources. This is exemplified with the rising number of\nbiotech-BigPharma collaborations and the generally well networked bioscience sector.\nThe evidence of what constitutes effective interorganizational networking practice for\ninnovation, signalled a disproportionate emphasis in favour of networking processes\nas distinct from their counterpart network structures. For example, these included\nprocesses for selecting network partners, limiting knowledge spill-over in\ngeographical clusters, co-learning, strategic positioning in multiple networks,\nrecognising the importance of informal social ties in facilitating collaboration and the\neffective management of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).\nManagerial implications: technological rules and design-oriented knowledge\nConflating the theoretical and empirical findings has identified a set of 7 grounded\ntechnological rules, associated with effective interorganizational networking for\ninnovation. More specifically, they comprise vital design-oriented knowledge for\npurposefully designing the structures and processes of effective networks. Thus\nimproving practices associated with operationalizing inter-organizational innovation\nnetworks through improved design, at both the strategic and operations management\nlevels.\nCollectively these rules represent a tentative taxonomy, a means of classifying design\nprinciples, to assist managers in navigating their decision making processes and\ndevising appropriate network development strategies. It acts as a useful framework\nfor evaluating current managerial practice and considering the range of possibilities\navailable to guide future action. In essence, the managerial implications of these rules\nsuggest that, together they provide an overall architecture for innovation management\nsolutions at an inter-organizational level. Figure 1 illustrates a conceptualisation of\nthe relationship between the taxonomy of rules and management action. Further field-\ntesting of these tentative rules through application is recommended. The following\nsections briefly consider the managerial implications of each rule.\nFigure 1. Conceptualising the relationship between rules and action\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n14\nDesign for lifecycle\nThe design for lifecycle rule conflates the theoretical construct \u2018dynamic perspective\u2019\nand management practices associated with increasingly varied and sophisticated co-\nnew product development (co-NPD) strategies. The implication of this rule for\nmanagers is that they need to be mindful of the potential for collaborative\nopportunities within the entire product lifecycle during co-NPD strategy formation.\nTherefore, they should seek to ensure sufficient flexibility in their negotiations with\npotential partners to allow for multi-phased co-NPD involvement where appropriate.\nIn other words, co-NPD strategies restricted to single phases of the NPD process i.e.\n(design or development) hold the risk of limiting the potential to collaborate during\nother downstream activities (i.e. marketing and logistics) in a more holistic and\nprofitable manner. This approach is echoed in the following quotation:\n\u201cWe went from out-licensing of everything to out-licensing in agreements and asking a bigger\npiece of the pie, going through different business models, in turn developing bigger\ninfrastructure, capabilities and then asking later on not only to co-develop, co-market and\nthen became bigger ourselves.\u201d (Head of Drug Discovery, Biotech)\nDesign for proactive management\nThe design for proactive management rule conflates the theoretical construct\n\u2018structure and process\u2019 and management practices associated with the coordination of\nnetworks. For example, setting up formal structures (i.e. small departments and units)\nand the processes to manage external linkages with co-NPD partners is becoming\nincreasingly common. The implication of this rule for managers is to recognize that\nthe effective operation of networks demands a degree of proactive management.\nMore specifically, this needs to be done with the appreciation of a generic process of\nnetwork development at play (i.e. creation, operation & closure of external linkages),\nif the full benefits of innovation, such as identifying complementarities and synergies\nfor exploitation purposes are to be reaped. In the words of one of our senior\nprofessionals:\n\u201cThere is an orchestrated networking program going on.\u201d (Alliance Manager, Biotech)\nDesign for emergence\nThe design for emergence rule conflates the theoretical construct \u2018unintended\nconsequences\u2019 and management practices associated with creating the conditions in\nwhich creativity and serendipity are encouraged. Often this invites a recognition of\nthe self organizing characteristics of networks. The implications of this rule for\nmanagers is to acknowledge the informal channels through which innovation and\nlearning take place which, by their very nature, do not lend themselves to formal\nmanagement controls. Valuing and harnessing this informality will enable greater\nscope to capitalize on the ad-hoc and emergent properties of network dynamics. This\nviewpoint was expressed by one of the research participants as follows:\n\u201cHow you find out something is very ad hoc. Something someone says will spark something in\nsomeone else mind. We can only but try to create opportunities for serendipity.\u201d (Head of\nBioinformatics, Big Pharma)\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n15\nDesign for diversity\nThe design for diversity rule conflates the theoretical construct \u2018heterogeneity\u2019 with\nmanagement practices associated with increasing the levels of diversity to enrich the\nNPD process. This is partially due to the separation of some research from\ndevelopment activities, and the generally higher levels of complexity in new products,\ncompounding the greater fragmentation of core disciplines and specialization. The\nimplications of this rule for managers is to encourage diversity of NPD experience,\nskills, and disciplines in networks to enhance the creative potential for innovation,\ndecision making and speed to market. The significance of diversity is clearly\nwitnessed in the following quotation:\nDesign for high involvement\nThe design for high involvement rule conflates the notions of \u2018connectivity\u2019 and\n\u2018relationship management\u2019 and management practices associated with increasing\nlevels of involvement of people with different backgrounds in networked NPD.\nEssentially;\n\u201c[Success] It all boils down to individual relationships. The whole area of relationship\nmanagement is very tough. We should never underestimate how important relationship\nmanagement is, or the individuals who are required for maintaining this. It falls down to the\ntwo people at the interface \u2013 the person in charge of the liaison from the BigPharma side with\nthe person from the biotech.\u201d (Alliance Manager, Biotech)\nThe implication for managers is to recognize that productive networks depend on\nprolific connectivity at both the structural level, (i.e. to create new \u2018bridges\u2019 between\npeople and organizations) and the processual level (i.e. to \u2018bond\u2019 the new relationship\nthrough nurturing). For small bioscience firms these heightened levels of connectivity\nallow them to develop both a voice and profile in the community.\nDesign for diffusion\nThe design for diffusion rule conflates the construct \u2018learning and knowledge transfer\u2019\nwith management practices associated with knowledge management within networked\nNPD teams. In the bioscience community, scientists are keen to ensure learning is not\ndivorced from practice by confining it to the pursuit of formal qualifications. The\nimplication for managers is to create practice-based learning opportunities within\nnetworks to facilitate knowledge transfer and not to limit learning to the traditional\nrealms of the classroom. A key judgment that managers might seek to make is the\ndegree of integration between the various networks that operate at the individual and\nfirm level, to gauge the relative ease by which knowledge can flow through them.\nThis will also assist the identification of further learning opportunities. The following\nquotation illustrates the potential for learning through networks:\n\u201cIt dawned on us that we have to invest in developing phenomenal networking capabilities, to\nhelp us to learn. The stakes were really high, the top management team had to come in\n\u201cWe want a lot of inter-disciplinarity; a lot of transferable skills. People working in R&D\nshould speak a diverse language. Since everyone is looking at different levels of details and\ndifferent levels of complexity, there are different priorities, different scales, different\nmagnitudes, and different parameters. It\u2019s is a very complex world.\u201d (Head of Bioinformatics,\nBig Pharma)\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n16\nagreement and we had to develop this as mission critical to survive.\u201d (Head of Drug\nDiscovery, Biotech)\nDesign for strategic innovation portfolio\nThe design for strategic innovation portfolio rule conflates the constructs\n\u2018embeddedness and complexity\u2019, \u2018openness and security\u2019 and \u2018continuous &\ndiscontinuous renewal\u2019 and the management practices associated with coordinating\nmultiple and different networks, some of which are embedded (e.g. one off co-venture\nagreements nested within a strategic alliance) and serve different purposes. Whilst\nthis situation is indicative of greater levels involvement and openness in R&D, it also\nbreeds insecurities regarding IPR issues:\n\u201cThere is public and private research. Public research is publications driven. Within\ncommercial private settings, there is privacy. Scientists are very nervous with their data. They\nalways hold it close to their chest. If you want to apply for a patent for a chemical compound,\nthen this data is a trace of your systematic research. For over 15 years there has been a\ndiscussion to let\u2019s make this lab journal electronic, but this has not happened. There is a very\nstrong reluctance to publish data.\u201d (R&D Manager, Big Pharma)\nThe implication for managers is to consider their firm\u2019s involvement in networks as a\nstrategic portfolio of their collaborative efforts. In doing so, they can begin to\ndistinguish different types of networks (i.e. strategic alliance, learning network, joint\nventure etc) and their related purpose (i.e. explorative or exploitative) to better\nmanage IP issues (e.g. security, risk and knowledge spill over).\nClearly bioscience firms are evolving their interorganizational networking capabilities\nin response to the challenges of creating new resources and value as they pursue\nproduct development. The authors consider this response within the context of a meta\nunderstanding of the industry dynamics and, how they might be strategically managed\nfor achieving future competitive advantage. Therefore, the following section explores\nthe overriding notion of interorganizational innovation from a Dynamic Capabilities\nView, an increasingly popular theoretical perspective in the field of Strategic\nManagement. In doing so, we seek to complement the implications for managerial\npractice, as discussed in an earlier section, with a consideration of the implications for\nstrategic management theory.\nDiscussion: Exploring a Dynamic Capability View\nNetwork Development Capability\nThe last decade has witnessed an upsurge in research seeking to incorporate different\nstrategic management perspectives in the field of operations management and strategy\n(Gagnon, 1999; Pandza et, al, 2003; Mills et al, 2003; Miller and Ross, 2003). In\nparticular, this work has begun to demonstrate the relevance of the Resource-Based\nView (RBV) and Dynamic Capability Views (DCV) to improved future research and\npractice. More recently, Pilkington and Fitzgerald (2006) foresee this shift to become\na prominent perspective focussing away from a Porterian paradigm, and more towards\na consideration of internal capability development for sustainable competitive\nadvantage. They go on to suggest that studies conducted under this up-and-coming\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n17\nwave are \u2018seeking a more subtle understanding of operations management by\nconsidering its practice in relations to strategy, context and resources\u2019. Thus making it\na useful theoretical departure point for our research. We hope to advance this\nemerging discourse by advocating new capabilities to coordinate network\ndevelopment relevant to strategy and operations in competitive global landscapes. In\ntrying to do so, we stress the important role of strategic alignment and some\n\u2018synergistic process of integrating business and operations strategic issues\u2019 (Anderson\net al, 1989) for significant impact on organization performance.\nThe research findings indicate that the industry dynamics in the burgeoning\nbiopharmaceuticals sector are shifting the locus of knowledge and value creation\nwithin the supply chains. The locus is moving away from the firm to being spread\nover a wider network of heterogeneous firms. This change is becoming a dominant\ndesign feature of the industry and signals an urgent need to develop\ninterorganizational networking capability for the purposes of innovation. In this\nsection the authors consider the DCV as a useful theoretical view, derived from the\nRBV of the firm, to explore an explanation for this relocation of knowledge and value\ncreation (Barney, 1991, Nelson, 1991; Penrose, 1959; Prahalad and Hamel, 1990;\nTeece et al, 1997). In doing so, the authors highlight the significance of a dynamic\ncapability which addresses the renewal of a network-specific resource base.\nThe RBV explores the link between internal features of the firm and its performance\n(Barney, 1991). At the heart of the theory lies the argument that organizations are a\nbundle of resources, that are simultaneously Valuable, Rare, Imitable and Non-\nsubstitutional, or in other words \u2018pass\u2019 Barney\u2019s VRIN test. Essentially the RBV\nlocates the source of competitive advantage inside the firm and associates rent\ngeneration with VRIN qualified resources, controlled by the firm. To briefly\nsummarize, the RBV discusses value creation through alterations in the firm\u2019s\nheterogeneous resource base that is considered to be idiosyncratic and sticky in\nrelation to the firm itself, or in other words \u2018firm-specific\u2019. Finally, the RBV deals\nwith the business level question of how to compete and is espoused to be a static\ntheoretical perspective, as it considers resources at a specific point in a firm\u2019s history\n(Preim and Butler, 2001).\nA relatively recent elaboration of the RBV of the firm, the DCV, addresses the\nunderpinning organizational routines associated with future resource creation. The\nDCV focuses on the capacity of a firm to renew resource bundles or in other words\n\u2018integrate, build and reconfigure internal and external competencies to address\nchanging environments\u2019 (Teece et al 1997). Whilst the functionality of such\ndynamics capabilities is generic, their value lies in the resource configurations they\ncreate and not in the capabilities themselves (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). In a\nmanner not dissimilar to Henderson and Cockburn (1994) conception of \u2018architectural\ncompetence\u2019, this signals a co-evolutionary process in which the interaction of\nresources, competencies and capabilities within the firm are transformed into\ncompetitive advantage.\nMajor theoretical contributions to both the RB and DC views do not fully develop\ntheir discourse at the interorganizational level. Therefore, Cohen and Levinthal\u2019s\n(1989) depiction of the crucial role of knowledge creation through endogenous R&D\nefforts and discussion of \u2018absorptive capacity\u2019, combined with the adoption of\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n18\ntechnologies developed by others (outside the firm) for successful innovation, present\na significant challenge to the traditional RB and DC view. However, the authors\nargue there is scope for the RB and DC views to better inform the broader practice of\nmanaging innovation in an increasingly multi-player (or network) context.\nHagedoorn and Duysters (2002) more recently fortify the DCV by similarly stressing\nthe importance of the efficient use of external resources. Similar sentiments are borne\nin the light of more recent discussions by Day & Shoemaker (2006) of how\ncompanies develop \u2018peripheral vision\u2019 - a propensity to exercise vigilance over the\ndemands of their environments and so maintain a competitive position. The various\ncontributions of these authors are alluding to the importance of knowledge and value\ncreation being located outside the boundary of the single firm.\nInspired by the DCV the authors propose that, in the context of fast changing\nbiopharmaceuticals environment, the notion of the \u2018firm\u2019 is a distinction that needs to\nbe relaxed and elevated to an \u2018inter-firm\u2019 conceptualisation. Following on from this\nproposition, the authors suggest that the various connections or relationships between\nfirms in a wider inter-firm network can in themselves amount to being \u2018network\nresources\u2019 and specific to the network itself. Whilst such resources exist in the spaces\nbetween individual firms they still pass the VRIN test, yet are not controlled by any\nsingle firm and so present a different category of resource altogether, to that which is\narticulated by the traditional RBV. In this new category, the control of resources is\nconsidered to be distributed within the network. A further distinction from the\ntraditional RBV is that for these resources for many biopharmaceutical firms come\nwith the promise of future rents, rather than actual rents. As Bowman and Ambrosini\n(2003) indicate \u2018because the processes of resources creation are not well understood,\nand because the identification of rent generating resources is problematic, we have to\nexamine the processes of asset creation\u2019. Due to causal ambiguity it is difficult to\ndetermine which particular activities if enacted will result in the creation of \u2018true\u2019\nresources that fulfil the VRIN tests. Bowman and Ambrosini (2003) go on to suggest\nthat it might be appropriate to investigate the activities and processes that should\ncreate assets (non rent generating resources) and may result in new resources (i.e.\nthose that are rent generating).\nTherefore in the biopharmaceuticals sector, dynamic capabilities associated with the\nresource creation (both assets and resources) cannot be simply considered to be \u2018firm\nspecific\u2019, as some are likely to be enacted at higher level, within a wider network at an\ninter-firm level. Subsequently these capabilities reconfigure assets and resources that\nare both specific to the firm and specific to the wider network, through an inter play\nwhich may allow for certain resources to become more idiosyncratic and perhaps\nfirm-specific over-time. Therefore, the wider network contributes to knowledge and\nvalue creation by exhibiting dynamic capabilities. Whether or not the process of new\nresource creation is triggered reactively or proactively, it may involve processes of\ncoordination, replication, learning and reconfiguration (Teece et al, 1997). In alluding\nto Bower\u2019s (1993) network approach we recognise the possibility of firms accessing\nresources not simply through direct relationships, but also via third party relationships\nand contributors to the total resources of the wider network.\nWith a view to developing the theoretical discourses in the DCV at an inter-firm and\nnetwork level, the authors highlight the significance of a dynamic capability which\naddresses the renewal of network connections and relationships (i.e. a resource and\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n19\nasset base that is specific to the network) in line with changes to its environment. It is\nessentially concerned with the network development process (i.e. creation, operation\nand closure). If we consider Makadok\u2019s (2001) argument that dynamic capabilities\nare built rather than bought in the market, and so embedded in the firm, this dynamic\ncapability is similarly nurtured over time, yet embedded in a wider network. Indeed\nnetwork connections and relationships are considered to be network-specific assets\nand resources, that would display path dependencies and so difficult to imitate. The\ntheoretical implications of such a suggestion are that we relax our distinctions of what\nconstitutes the firm and consider the network as a higher order entity that may also\npossess assets and resources, and so suggest a blurring between firm and network\nlevel strategic issues. This reflection inevitably calls into question the idea of \u2018firm-\nspecificity\u2019 in the traditional RB and DC views. The challenging role for the\nnetworked firm is the creation of new resource configurations from within a resource\nbase that is controlled in a distributed manner by networked firms. Our propositions\namount to dynamic capability that is not simply performed by the single firm, but is\nenacted and performed at the network level. Our suggestions to some extent\ncorroborate Dyer and Singh (1998) notion of relational capability development.\nIt seems reasonable to advocate that competitive advantage cannot be manipulated\nwithin the boundary of the single firm as assumed by a traditional RB and DC views\nwith their preoccupation with firm-specific resources and capabilities, enacted at the\nfirm level. In the growing biopharmaceuticals industry the locus for innovation is\nshifting into a broader network of firms, rendering a preoccupation with leveraging\nnetwork-specific resources and capabilities as worthwhile. Firms recognising they are\na \u2018node\u2019 in a network can encourage competitive advantage through the careful\nrenewal of network connections and relationships. Indeed new assemblies and bundles\nof such network resources could potentially generate the new and unique value.\nConclusions and Further Research\nRelatively novel organizational forms such as networks are being deployed to access\nnew technologies and their associated know-how to improve innovation capacity.\nSuch opportunities to exploit superior external knowledge resources for new product\ndevelopment have become a distinctive feature of the burgeoning biopharmaceuticals\nindustry. Consequently, the prevailing industry dynamics are shifting the locus of\nknowledge and value creation away from the firm and into the broader enterprise of\nthe network. This poses important questions concerning the nature of resources that\nreside in the space between firms and how they are leveraged for innovation. Such\ninquiries are relevant to improving practices associated with operationalizing inter-\norganizational innovation networks, at both the strategic and operations management\nlevels.\nThis research has deployed van Aken\u2019s seminal ideas about generating design-\noriented knowledge to assist managers in pursuit of the benefits of inter-organization\ninnovation. It reveals 7 empirically and theoretically grounded technological rules\nassociated with the effective inter-organizational networking for innovation, through\nimproved design. They compose vital knowledge which provides solution architecture\nTowards Technological Rules for Designing Innovation Networks: a Dynamic Capabilities View\n20\nof viable action options for managers a priori, to purposefully design innovation\nnetworks. Collectively the rules represent tentative taxonomy, a means of classifying\ndesign principles for managers to shape their decision making processes and devise\nappropriate network development strategies and operations. It also acts as a useful\nframework for evaluating current managerial practices and considering the range of\npossibilities available to guide future action. Thus constituting valuable transferable\nknowledge to support improvements in organizational innovation capacity and\nperformance.\nIn acknowledging that this research contributes a tentative taxonomy of design rules\nfor practicing managers, we recommend field-testing as an important antecedent to\nmanagement action. A further limitation of this research is its focus on\nBiopharmaceuticals sector, and so future investigations to refine the taxonomy should\nspan additional industrial contexts.\nFinally, following the recent upsurge in research incorporating different strategic\nmanagement perspectives in the field of operations management and strategy, we\nsuccumb in the same spirit. In seeking to advance this emerging discourse we\nconsider the resource-based and dynamic capability views, and advocate new\ncapabilities to coordinate network development. More specifically, we highlight the\nsignificance of a dynamic capability which addresses the renewal of network-specific\nresources in response to changes in the competitive environment. Unlike dynamic\ncapabilities enacted at the firm level, this one is enacted at a network level.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to express their deepest thanks to the Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), UK-Biobank and IBM Business\nConsulting (Life Sciences Division) as the sponsors of this exploratory study.
