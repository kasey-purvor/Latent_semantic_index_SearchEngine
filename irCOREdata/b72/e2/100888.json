Box 808, Livermore, California 94550\n(Dated: February 4, 2008)\nThe B(E1;1\/2+ \u2192 1\/2\u2212) strength for 11Be has been extracted from intermediate energy Coulomb\nexcitation measurements, over a range of beam energies using a new reaction model, the extended\ncontinuum discretized coupled channels (XCDCC) method. In addition, a measurement of the\nexcitation cross section for 11Be+208Pb at 38.6 MeV\/nucleon is reported. The B(E1) strength of\n0.105(12) e2fm2 derived from this measurement is consistent with those made previously at 60 and 64\nMeV\/nucleon, in contrast to an anomalously low result obtained at 43 MeV\/nucleon. By coupling a\nmulti-configuration description of the projectile structure with realistic reaction theory, the XCDCC\nmodel provides for the first time a fully quantum mechanical description of Coulomb excitation.\nThe XCDCC calculations reveal that the excitation process involves significant contributions from\nnuclear, continuum, and higher-order effects. An analysis of the present and two earlier intermediate\nenergy measurements yields a combined B(E1) strength of 0.105(7) e2fm2. This value is in good\nagreement with the value deduced independently from the lifetime of the 1\/2\u2212 state in 11Be, and\nhas a comparable precision.\nPACS numbers: 25.70.De,24.10.Eq,27.20.+n\nThe transition strengths between the lowest energy\nstates of nuclei are amongst their most fundamental prop-\nerties, being related to the configuration of the states,\nand consequently to particular aspects of the NN inter-\naction. As such, transition strengths are especially im-\nportant for nuclei near the limits of stability, and pro-\nvide important input for nuclear astrophysics. Lifetime\nmeasurements, whenever possible, are often the preferred\nmethod for measuring transition strengths. A less direct\nmethod of determining these strengths is Coulomb ex-\ncitation, whereby the projectile is excited via the field\nof virtual photons produced by a heavy target [1]. One\nof the advantages of the Coulomb excitation method is\n\u2217present address: LPSC-Grenoble, IN2P3-CNRS, F-38026 Greno-\nble Cedex, France\n\u2020present address: CCLRC Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, War-\nrington, Cheshire, WA4 4AD, UK\n\u2021present address: Rudjer Bos\u02c7kovic\u00b4 Institute, Bijenic\u02c7ka 54, HR-\n10000 Zagreb, Croatia\n\u00a7present address: Gesellschaft fu\u00a8r Schwerionenforschung GSI, D-\n64291 Darmstadt, Germany\nthat it can be applied to a wider variety of nuclei. It\nis thus important to validate the method for the well\nknown dripline cases. Such work has been performed for\nquadrupole transitions on mostly stable nuclei [2]. In\nthis paper we focus on dipole transitions applied to an\nunstable system, and resolve a long standing experimen-\ntal anomaly.\nThe 11Be system is an archetype of a halo nucleus\nand exhibits the fastest known dipole transition between\nbound states in nuclei. The B(E1) transition strength\nbetween the ground and the only bound excited state\nwas determined from lifetime measurements by Millener\net al. to be 0.116(12) e2fm2 [3].\nThe anomalously low value for the Coulomb excita-\ntion cross section from a lead target at 43 MeV\/nucleon\n[4] produced a cross section approximately 40% of that\nexpected from Alder and Winther theory of Coulomb\nexcitation [5]. Subsequently, further experiments have\nbeen performed to verify this measurement, utilizing dif-\nferent targets and energies; MSU at \u223c60 MeV\/nucleon\non Pb,Au,Be,C [6], RIKEN at 64 MeV\/nucleon on Pb\n[7]. The results of these measurements showed broad\nagreement with the lifetime measurement, although at\n2the lower limit of the uncertainties. However, all of the\nsubsequent measurements have been performed at signifi-\ncantly (\u223c50%) higher energy than the anomalous GANIL\nmeasurement.\nPrevious analyses of Coulomb excitation experiments\nto extract the B(E1) of 11Be [4, 6, 7] have relied upon\nthe Alder and Winther theory of Coulomb excitation [5].\nA summary of B(E1) strengths extracted using Alder-\nWinther theory was given in Fig. 2 of Ref. [6]. Although\nthis theory gives a useful proportional relationship be-\ntween the B(E1) and the cross section, many approxi-\nmations are applied. The Alder and Winther approach\nassumes that the reaction occurs as a single-step excita-\ntion induced by the virtual photons forming the Coulomb\nfield of the target.\nThere have been many theoretical efforts to investi-\ngate whether this anomaly could be explained by con-\ntinuum, coupled channel [8] and multi-step effects [9], a\nmore accurate treatment of the nuclear absorption [10],\nand relativistic effects [11]. As summarized in Ref. [6],\nestimates for corrections to Alder-Winther theory at the\nGANIL energy were; continuum effects 4% [8], higher or-\nder effects 6\u201311% [9] and 8% [4], and nuclear effects 8%\n[4]. None of these theoretical studies could explain the\nanomalously low cross section of Anne et al. [4]. The the-\noretical uncertainty from extracting the B(E1) strengths\nusing Alder-Winther theory of Coulomb excitation aris-\ning from all of these corrections is not included in the\nuncertainty quoted (10-13%) [4, 6, 7], as this relates to\nthe experimental uncertainty only. Additionally, a recent\nanalysis of nuclear effects by Hussein et al. [12], shows\nthat estimating the nuclear contribution to the Coulomb\nexcitation cross section from the corresponding cross sec-\ntion on the light targets is unreliable.\nThe effects of these approximations have been exam-\nined individually, but a consistent analysis which includes\nall of them simultaneously has so far not been applied.\nOne main difficulty is that fully quantum mechanical re-\naction theories, such as the continuum discretized cou-\npled channels (CDCC) method [13], treat the projectile\nof interest as a single particle state: in the case of 11Be,\na 2s1\/2 neutron coupled to an inert\n10Be core. Under the\nconstraint of a reasonable r.m.s. radius for the ground\nstate of 11Be, a single particle structure model for 11Be\nover-estimates the B(E1) transition strength between the\nbound states by a factor of two and thus the predicted\ncross section is too large (see Set 0 Table I). Therefore\nin order to extract a reasonable B(E1) strength from the\ncross section, one must rely on strongly model-dependent\nassumptions.\nRecent advances in reaction modelling [14] allow for\nan improved structure input in the reaction theory. This\nis the first application of the extended continuum dis-\ncretized coupled channels (XCDCC) method developed\nin Ref. [14] to Coulomb excitation. The particle-rotor\nstructure model, as applied to 11Be in Ref. [15], yields\nan accurate B(E1) strength which can then be consis-\ntently included in the reaction theory using the formal-\n200 300 400 500 600 700\n \u03b3-ray Energy (keV)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nd\u03c3\n\/d\nE \n(ba\nrns\n\/M\neV\n)\nFIG. 1: (Color online).

Thus a reliable calculation\nfor the inelastic cross sections can be made for the first\ntime using a fully quantum mechanical description of the\nscattering process.\nHere we report a new experiment performed at 38.6\nMeV\/nucleon on a lead target at GANIL. The mea-\nsurement presented here was undertaken in an attempt\nto resolve any experimental problems and to elucidate\nany possible energy dependence in the extraction of the\nB(E1). We compare this measurement to theory pre-\ndictions using XCDCC, from which we extract a B(E1)\nstrength. We also investigate the effects of various cou-\nplings within the XCDCC framework to explore devia-\ntions from the standard Coulomb excitation theory esti-\nmated in previous theoretical studies [8, 9, 10, 11]. Fi-\nnally, we re-analyze results from all previous experiments\nand compare the B(E1) strengths extracted with that ob-\ntained from the lifetime measurement.\nThe data presented here were obtained utilizing a sec-\nondary beam of 11Be at GANIL, produced by the frag-\nmentation of a primary beam of 18O at 63 MeV\/nucleon\non a 9Be production target. The fragmentation products\nwere purified using the LISE3 spectrometer, resulting in\na beam of\u223c5000 11Be ions per second with 97% purity, at\na mean energy of 41 MeV\/nucleon with an energy spread\nof \u223c1%. The time-of-flight of the ions through the LISE\nspectrometer was measured event-by-event using a PPAC\nlocated at the entrance to the reaction chamber together\nwith an MCP, \u223c23 m upstream, and also relative to the\ncyclotron RF. These time-of-flight measurements allowed\nthe unique selection of 11Be ions event-by-event from the\n3% impurities in the beam (mainly 9Li and 13B).\nThe 11Be beam was incident on a 552 mg\/cm2 Pb\ntarget, resulting in a mid-target beam energy of 38.6\n3Veven Vodd Vso R a \u03b22 B(E1) \u03c3\n0 55.07 36.25 6.4 2.736 0.67 0 0.282 1092\nI 54.24 49.67 8.5 2.483 0.65 0.67 0.139 549\nII 55.22 50.82 8.5 2.483 0.60 0.67 0.125 493\nIII 55.04 48.10 5.0 2.483 0.65 0.67 0.116 459\nIV 55.70 48.86 5.0 2.483 0.60 0.67 0.106 421\nV 56.29 49.51 5.0 2.483 0.55 0.67 0.096 383\nTABLE I: 10Be-n Woods-Saxon potential parameters with en-\nergies in MeV and lengths in fm, along with the calculated\nB(E1) strength in e2fm2, and inelastic cross section in mb.\nSet 0 is the Be12-pure and Set I is the Be12-b, both from\nRef.

Charged particles were detected in a\nthree-stage telescope centered at 0\u25e6, consisting of two\n500 \u00b5m thick resistive-strip silicon detectors (providing\ntwo \u2206E measurements, and measurement of position in\nvertical (x) and horizontal (y) directions), backed by a\nclosely packed array of 16 CsI detectors in a 4\u00d74 ar-\nrangement [16]. The telescope subtended the angular\nrange \u00b19\u25e6 in x and y. Gamma rays were detected, in\ncoincidence with charged particles in the telescope, us-\ning four NaI detectors at \u00b145\u25e6 and \u00b1110\u25e6 to the beam\naxis, giving a total absolute photopeak efficiency of 3.1%\nfor detection of Doppler-shifted 320 keV \u03b3-rays (assum-\ning an isotropic distribution in the center-of-mass system\nand including relativistic forward-focusing effects of or-\nder 18% and absorption in the target of order 2%). Back-\nground data were taken with no target present in order\nto determine the contribution from reactions occurring in\nthe telescope itself. These were normalized to, and sub-\ntracted from, the target-in data. The present data was\nacquired contiguously with another experiment utilizing\nthe same setup [17]; the same calibration and analysis\nprocedures were used for the present measurement.\nThe Doppler corrected \u03b3-ray energy spectrum in co-\nincidence with 11Be, after background subtraction, is\nshown in Fig. 1 \u2014 a peak corresponding to the 1\/2\u2212 to\n1\/2\n+\ntransition (E\u03b3 = 320keV) is clearly evident, yield-\ning a cross section of 416(44) mb. The quoted error re-\nflects uncertainties in the fitting procedure, the detector\nefficiencies, the integrated number of 11Be beam particles\nand the target thickness. Next we compare with reaction\ntheory predictions in order to extract the B(E1).\nAn accurate prediction of the B(E1) strength can\nbe obtained in the particle-rotor model, where 11Be is\ntreated as a deformed 10Be coupled to a neutron (see\nSet I Table I) [15]. This two-body structure model as-\nsumes 10Be is a rotor and includes its 2+ excited state\nexplicitly. It predicts around 15% excited core contri-\nbutions in the ground state of 11Be, in good agreement\nwith no-core shell model calculations [18], and experi-\nment [19, 20, 21, 22]. It also produces B(E1)=0.139\ne2fm2 between the two bound states, which is close to\nthe value extracted from the lifetime measurement.\nThe 11Be description we use in the XCDCC calcula-\n\u03c3Coulex (mb)\nbeam energy (MeV\/nucleon) 39 59\nPure Coulomb one-step 706 500\n+ nuclear absorption 579 421\n+ nuclear in the excitation coupling 687 499\n+ bound states coupled to all orders 642 469\n+ continuum coupled to all orders 506 407\n+ dynamical core excitation (full XCDCC) 549 415\nTABLE II: Calculated 11Be+Pb Coulomb excitation cross\nsections at 39 MeV\/nucleon (this work) and at 59\nMeV\/nucleon (MSU) showing the effects of the progressive\nimprovements in the reaction calculation (see text).\ntions is the model described above. We consider a set\nof parameters based on Be12-b from Table I of Ref. [15],\nwhich are given in Set I of Table I. Later in the paper\nwe will consider the sensitivity of the cross sections to\nvarious parameterizations of this potential which yield\nvarying B(E1) strengths. The neutron-target interac-\ntion used is the global optical potential of Schandt et\nal. [23]. The 10Be-Pb central interaction is taken from\nRef. [24]. In XCDCC calculations, this interaction is fur-\nther deformed using \u03b2n2 = 0.67 for the nuclear part and\n\u03b2C2 = 1.13 for the Coulomb, consistent with Ref. [25].\nWhen re-analyzing all previous Coulomb excitation data,\nwe use the same 10Be-target potential parameters but\nscale the radius parameters from the Pb to the Au tar-\nget. Errors arising from uncertainties in the nuclear op-\ntical potentials are small [26].\nNext we give a brief description of the model space for\nthe XCDCC calculation. For the 11Be bound and contin-\nuum states, we take all partial waves up to \u2113max = 3. The\n10Be-n continuum is discretized up to JpiPmax = 5\/2\n+ and\nErel \u2264 5 MeV. As we are only interested in the inelastic\ncross section to the bound excited state, the details of\nthe continuum are not important and thus it is sufficient\nto use rather broad energy bins. For this reason 40 bins\nare included, 5 bins for JpiP = 3\/2\n\u2212, 5\/2+, with ground\nstate core components in the boundary conditions, and 2\nbins for all other partial waves. Radial integrals for the\ncontinuum bins were performed out to 50 fm with a step\nlength of 0.01 fm.\nIn Table II we present a summary of the various types\nof reaction calculation that can be performed for this sys-\ntem taking the 11Be structure model directly from [15].\nBy turning off couplings within XCDCC, we can provide\nan indication of the size of the various effects which have\npreviously been estimated.\nWe start with the quantum formulation closest to the\nsemi-classical Alder-Winther theory: pure Coulomb one-\nstep, taking only Coulomb interactions for incoming and\noutgoing waves, as well as for the transition operator.\nThis would be similar to the DWBA formulation with\nCoulomb waves, except that here we go beyond Alder-\nWinther theory as the projectile is described within a\ncoupled channels model. The cross section of 706 mb\n4(Table II) obtained with this simplistic approach is unre-\nalistically large. This is well understood as arising from\nthe lack of nuclear absorption: in the Alder-Winther the-\nory a lower limit on the impact parameter is introduced\nto account for this. The sensitivity of the cross section on\nthis is investigated in Ref. [10], where a cutoff obtained\nfrom the particle-rotor structure model is applied. When\nintroducing nuclear absorption into the XCDCC calcu-\nlation by including a diagonal nuclear potential in the\n11Be+Pb optical potential, the cross section is reduced\nto 579 mb.\nThe nuclear potential in the distorted waves has a neg-\nligible effect on the cross section. By subsequently in-\ncluding the nuclear interaction in the transition opera-\ntor, the cross section is increased by 19%. Note that\nnuclear excitation cross section to the 1\/2\u2212 state yields\n27 mb. This reaffirms that nuclear effects cannot be sim-\nply subtracted, as nuclear-Coulomb interference is very\nlarge [12]. Coupling the two bound states to all orders\nreduces the cross section by 7%. A reduction of 21% is\nobtained with the inclusion of the continuum, resulting\nin a cross section of 506 mb. Finally, XCDCC can include\nthe dynamical excitation of the core during the reaction,\nwhich has not been studied previously. This coupling al-\nlows the 10Be core to change spin through its interaction\nwith the target. The ground and excited states of 11Be\nhave different amounts of excited core contributions and\ntherefore this coupling allows the relative amounts of ex-\ncited core contributions to re-adjust, enhancing the cross\nsection by 9%. Including this effect, which corresponds\nto the full XCDCC calculation, yields a final cross section\nof 549 mb.\nIt is remarkable that the full calculation produces a\ncross section similar (within 5%) to the Coulomb-only\none-step calculation with nuclear distortion (second line\nin Table II). This is due to the strong increase arising\nfrom the nuclear interaction being (coincidentally in the\ncurrent case) nearly canceled by the inclusion of the con-\ntinuum.\nThe importance of nuclear effects has little dependence\non the beam energy and precise scattering angles. An\nanalysis of the MSU experiment on the Pb target re-\nveals a similar progression of corrections (+19%,-6%,-\n13%,+2% for an overall change of -2%). The presence\nof effects of the order of 20% suggests again that Alder-\nWinther theory should not be relied upon for the extrac-\ntion of the B(E1).\nThe calculations presented here are integrated over the\nfull angular range. While the MSU measurement had the\nsmallest angular acceptance, this still contained 99% of\nthe total inelastic cross section. Owing to the significant\nincrease in computation time required to get this level\nof accuracy on the angular distribution, the effect of the\nangular cut was neglected for these calculations. For all\nof the other measurements the angular acceptance was\nlarger and had a negligible effect on the inelastic cross\nsection.\nRelativistic effects are not included in the present\n40 50 60 70\nEnergy (MeV\/nucleon)\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\n0.14\n0.16\nB(\nE1\n) (\ne2 f\nm\n2 )\nLifetime\nGANIL2\nthis work\nMSU\nRIKEN\nGANIL1\nPb\nAu\nCoulomb Excitation\nCoulex\nFIG. 2: Comparison of B(E1) values obtained from lifetime\nand Coulomb excitation measurements.

Although a full\nrelativistic quantum mechanical formulation is still lack-\ning, for the measurement reported in this paper we there-\nfore expect that errors arising from the non-relativistic\ntreatment of the reaction are less than 2%, and around\n5% for the MSU and RIKEN measurements respectively.\nThe full XCDCC calculations for 11Be Coulomb excita-\ntion at an energy of 38.6 MeV\/nucleon on a lead target,\nusing set I from Table I for n-10Be, produced \u03c3 = 549\nmb, somewhat larger than the measured cross section\nof 416(44) mb. As the structure model [15] somewhat\nover-predicts the B(E1) strength (0.139 e2fm2 compared\nto 0.116(12) e2fm2 from lifetime measurements) we ex-\nplore small variations in the parameterization. By vary-\ning the diffuseness and spin-orbit potential depth, then\nadjusting the odd and even potential depths to repro-\nduce the ground and excited state binding energies, a\nrange of B(E1) strengths were obtained (sets I\u2013V of Ta-\nble I). We note that Set III is the parameterization used\nin Ref. [10]. We found a good linear relationship be-\ntween the B(E1) strength and the Coulomb excitation\ncross section, as would be the case if Alder-Winther the-\nory were valid. The deviation from the linear regression\nis very small. Finally, we find that the experimental cross\nsection is reproduced when the model for 11Be predicts\nB(E1)=0.105(12) e2fm2, in good agreement with the life-\ntime measurement.\n5We now re-analyze the cross sections from the previ-\nous experiments and extract B(E1) consistently, using\nthe same reaction model, namely XCDCC. The results\nare summarized in Fig. 2. Our re-analysis of the previous\nGANIL measurement yields the much lower B(E1) value,\n0.048(9) e2fm2. The authors of this work had mentioned\nin their previous article \u201cthis result remains difficult to\ninterpret, and even if there is no indication of a possible\nerror in the analysis, we feel that it should be regarded\nwith some caution until it has been confirmed in a new\nexperiment\u201d [4]. It has become apparent, based on sub-\nsequent observations of the electronic counting\/dividing\nmodules employed, that this measurement may have been\naffected by a problem in the normalization of the beam\nintensity [27].\nFor the MSU measurement, we deduce\nB(E1)=0.101(16) e2fm2 and 0.084(12) e2fm2 for\nthe Pb and Au targets respectively. For the RIKEN\nmeasurement, B(E1)= 0.106(11) e2fm2. All of these\nare consistent with the results from the lifetime mea-\nsurement. It may be remarked that the Au target\nmeasurement, in contrast with the three Pb measure-\nments, involved a correction of order 50% for \u03b3-ray\nabsorption in the target. The three Pb results, with\nquoted errors of 10\u201315%, are internally consistent at the\n5% level. Taking into account the possible experimental\nproblems with the original GANIL measurement and\nalso the rather large target correction for the only Au\ndata point, the remaining three measurements \u2014 all\nwith a Pb target \u2014 have been combined to give a\nweighted average of B(E1)=0.105(7) e2fm2.\nPrior to this work, one could speculate that the anoma-\nlous measurement indicated an energy dependence in the\nCoulomb excitation method for the extraction of the\nB(E1). Our new measurement removes this possibility.\nIn summary, the work described here demonstrates the\nvalidity of the Coulomb excitation method for extract-\ning B(E1) of exotic nuclei, using a fully quantum me-\nchanical treatment of the reaction process. Moreover, we\nhave shown that the accuracy of B(E1) extracted from\nCoulomb excitation can be comparable with that from\nlifetime measurements.\nThis work was supported in part by NNSA through\nDOE Cooperative Agreement DEFC03-03NA00143,\nNSCL, Michigan State University, and the National Sci-\nence Foundation through grant PHY-0456656, and under\nthe auspices of the University of California, Lawrence\nLivermore National Laboratory under contract No. W-\n7405-Eng-48.
