INTRODUCTION\nSINGLE-CRYSTAL turbine blades are routinely cast\nfrom Ni-based superalloys. The primary aims of producing\nsingle crystals are to (1) eliminate grain boundaries that limit\ncreep ductility and (2) orient the elastically soft \u0001001\u0002 ori-\nentation parallel to the maximum load direction to minimize\ncyclic stresses during thermal cycling.[1]\nHowever, in certain circumstances pertaining to mechan-\nical response, it is necessary to impose a specific nonaxial\n\u0001001\u0002 orientation on the component. This is achieved using\na single-crystal seed of desired orientation.\nIn commercial production, the prefabricated seed is par-\ntially melted-back during the soak period of the mold and,\nsubsequently, molten alloy is introduced through the mold\ncavity across the seed melt-back interface and the mold is\nthen withdrawn from the furnace. During directional solid-\nification, it has been observed that there is a continuous\nnucleation of crystals with random orientations at the seed\nperiphery, up to a distance of \u00012 mm ahead of the melt-\nback interface.[2] In current practice, these stray grains have\nto be eliminated using a spiral grain selector to transfer the\ndesired single-crystal structure from the seed to the com-\nponent. In order to remove the spiral selector during single-\ncrystal seeding, it is essential to understand the mechanism(s)\nby which these stray grains nucleate and to suppress their\noccurrence.\nOne of the mechanisms proposed in a prior study was that\nsecondary dendrites were pinched off by convective currents\nin the semisolid region of the melted-back seed and, sub-\nsequently, transported ahead of the dendrite tips to form\nthese stray grains.[3] However, a more recent study discounted\nthis theory using detailed optical and electron microscopy\non quenched samples to capture the melt-back interface and\nthe overlying liquid.[4] Although islands of misoriented grains\nwere observed to occur uniformly throughout the mushy\nzone and were attributed to melted-back secondaries, their\ndensity was insufficient to account for the concentration of\ndefects observed at the periphery of the casting after with-\ndrawal had started. Further, buoyancy-driven convective jets\nwould drive the dendrite fragments to the interior, rather\nthen the periphery.[5]\nA subsequent investigation aimed at determining the ori-\ngin and growth of these stray grains involved sequential\nmicrostructural characterizations beginning from the seed\nmelt-back to \u000130 mm ahead of the growth front using opti-\ncal and electron microscopy in conjunction with electron\nbackscattered diffraction.[2] The main observation was the\nprofuse nucleation of equiaxed stray grains almost uniformly\naround the perimeter of the seed (Figure 1(a)) within a dis-\ntance of \u00012 mm from the melt-back interface. This indi-\ncated that the nucleation of these stray grains could be a\ntransient process caused by the thermal fluctuations during\nmelt-back\/startup. However, successive transverse sections\nmoving away from the melt-back revealed that few of these\ngrains survived, indicating that growth mechanisms also play\na significant role (Figures 1(b) and (c)). It was concluded\nfrom these observations that the unwanted macroscopic stray\ngrains are a manifestation of growth rather than of prefer-\nential nucleation.\nThe objective of the study described in this article is to\nunderstand the possible mechanisms of stray-grain nucle-\nation and growth occurring during seed melt-back during\ndirectional solidification.

EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION\nIt was concluded from prior experimental observations\nthat the unwanted macroscopic stray grains are a manifes-\ntation of growth rather than of preferential nucleation. In the\npresent work, the experiments and simulations conducted\nconcentrated on the competitive growth between the seed\nand the stray grains nucleated at the perimeter of the seed,\nin particular, the influence of (1) the asymmetric thermal\nconditions in the furnace leading to possible curvature of\nthe local liquidus isotherm and (2) the seed orientation rel-\native to the casting geometry. In this section, experimental\nresults on the growth of stray grains in castings with dif-\nferent thermal geometries and seed orientations are reported.\nA. Details of Casting Procedure\nA fully instrumented, industrial directional solidification-\ncasting furnace situated at Rolls\u2013Royce Company Research\nand Development Foundry (Bristol, United Kingdom) was\nused for the present investigation. A complete description\nof the furnace is available elsewhere,[6,7] and only the salient\nfeatures will be highlighted here. The furnace is comprised\nof three zones: (1) a vacuum induction melting unit, (2) a\nresistance-heated central chamber, and (3) a withdrawal\nchamber (Figure 2). The basic steps during casting of single-\ncrystal seeded components are as follows.\n(1) All three chambers are evacuated to a partial pressure\nof \u000110\u00033 Pa, and the mold containing the seeds of\ndesired orientation is raised into the furnace. The seeds\nare contained in the mold and rest on the water-cooled\ncopper chill plate, which is fitted to the ram.\nFig. 1\u2014(a) Electron backscattered diffraction analysis of a transverse section \u00022 mm ahead of the melt-back interface.

During soaking, a partial melt-back\nof the seed takes place, depending on the soak tem-\nperature.\n(3) Following the soak, the charge in the upper melting cham-\nber is induction melted and poured into the mold cavity.\nThe ram containing the mold is then withdrawn from the\nfurnace at a predetermined speed. The withdrawal rate\nin the present experiments was 1 \u0004 10\u00034 ms\u00031. Thermo-\ncouple measurements yielded an average thermal gradi-\nent of 3 Kmm\u00031, and details are reported elsewhere.[8]\nIn all the casting experiments, the alloy used was the sec-\nond-generation superalloy CMSX4. The nominal composi-\ntion and liquidus temperature (measured using differential\nthermal analysis) are given in Table I.[8]\nB. Experiments for Investigating the Chill Effect \nof the Mold Wall\nIn order to eliminate any chilling effect associated with\na cold mold, three different soak temperatures were used\nwith a standard soak time, and the corresponding melt-back\nfrom the base of the seed was measured in each case. This\nwas done using routine optical microscopy on longitudinal\nseed sections. The sections were initially ground flat using\na grind-stone of 150 grit, followed by a polishing with 9 \u0005m\nand then 3 \u0005m diamond slurries. These sections were sub-\nsequently etched with nimonic reagent to reveal the den-\ndritic structure. The soak conditions used led to mold\ntemperatures of 1475 \u00b0C, 1500 \u00b0C, and 1525 \u00b0C, with a soak\ntime of 20 minutes. In order to determine the role of the\nsuperheating of the liquid-melt charge in relation to the soak\nconditions in producing an additional melt-back in the seed\n(Point 2 in Section II\u2013A), in each mold cluster, runners feed-\ning alternate seeds on the carousel were plugged to block\nthe introduction of liquid metal. Therefore, the flow of super-\nheated liquid only occurred across the seed surface for three\nof the six seeds in each assembly. Referring to Table II,\nthe seeds not experiencing superheated liquid metal across\ntheir surface are classified as dummy seeds. The seeds were\nin the as-cast state and shaped in the form of truncated\ncylinders (diameter \u0006 12 mm and height \u0006 35 mm) with a\nlongitudinal flat of width of 9 mm. Unless otherwise stated,\nthe seeds were located in the mold such that the reference\nflats faced radially outward toward the heater, i.e., away\nfrom the central sprue (Figure 2). The seeds had off-axial\norientations, with the primary \u0001001\u0002 deviating from the\nvertical (Z) axis in the range of 13 to 18 deg.\nFor the case of the soak temperatures of 1500 \u00b0C and\n1525 \u00b0C, the overlying melt temperature was approximately\nthe same as the mold soak temperature. Therefore, in all the\nsubsequent experiments, the soak conditions adopted were\n1500 \u00b0C and a soak time of 20 minutes.\nC. Experiments Related to Growth of Stray Grains\nIn this section, we consider the competitive growth\nbetween the stray grains nucleated at the perimeter of the\nseed and the seed crystal. There are two quite distinct sources\nof asymmetry in the growth of single crystals. First, since\nthe castings consist of clusters of specimens around a cen-\ntral sprue, the heat-transfer conditions toward the sprue and\ntoward the furnace will be different, leading to a possible\ninclination, or curvature, of the solid-liquid interface; this\nwill apply to both symmetric \u0001001\u0002 and off-axis orienta-\ntions. Second, for off-axis orientations, the inclination of the\ndendrites with respect to the geometry of the casting may\naffect the mechanisms of competitive grain growth between\nthe seed and any stray grains nucleated at the periphery.\nHere, we report a series of experiments intended to differ-\nentiate the roles of (1) specimen disposition in the asymmetric\nfurnace conditions and (2) the inclination of the dendritic\nstructure relative to the casting geometry on the nucleation\nand competitive grain growth of stray grains.\nFigure 3 shows a typical single-crystal casting; the seed\nand initial part of the single-crystal growth before the spiral\nselector is encountered, which are cylindrical, were carefully\ncharacterized in the present study. An orthogonal co-ordinate\nsystem was defined with the Z-axis along the cylinder axis\nand the X-axis normal to either a reference longitudinal flat\nor an inscribed line on the casting surface (see Figure 3(a)).\nThe dominant dendrite-growth direction, along the \u0001001\u0002\ndirection closest to the Z-axis, can be defined by the two\nangles \u0007 and \b, where \u0007 is the angle between the dendrite\naxis and the Z-axis of the casting and \b is the azimuthal\nangle between the plane normal to the Y-axis and the plane\ncontaining the dendrite and the Z-axis of the casting.\nFor each casting, the position of stray grains around the\nperimeter was related to the specimen frame of reference.\nThe segment of the perimeter containing stray grains which\npropagate upwards beyond \u00022 mm, such as in Figure 1(b,)\nwas defined by the two angles \t1 and \t2, measured from the\nX-axis in an anticlockwise direction (Figure 3(b) and (c)).\nThe relationship of the dendrite direction to the specimen\nframe of reference allows the segment of the casting perime-\nter where dendrites diverged on growth from the mold to\nbe defined. This will consist of a semicircle with limits of\n\n90 deg from the projection of the dendrite direction on\nthe XY specimen plane. These angles are designated as \u000b1\nand \u000b2, respectively.\nOf the two halves of the cylinder cross section, in the left-\nhand half, the primary \u0001001\u0002 stems at the seed perimeter\nTable II.

In the present\nexperiments, \f \u0006 48.6 deg, R \u0006 6 mm, and L \u0006 9 mm.\nFor this truncated cylindrical-seed geometry, depending on\nthe seed-flat location, i.e., the magnitudes of \f and \b, there\nare two possible cases that could affect the values of \u000b where\nstray grains might be observed: (1) \b \r \f and (2) \b \u0002 \f.\nFor both cases, the primary \u0001001\u0002 stems at the seed perime-\nter form a diverging disposition in relation to the mold wall\nwithin the region APD and are converging over the remain-\ning portion ASD (Figure 3(b)). The angles \u000b1 and \u000b2, defined\nin Figure 3(b), have the following characteristics:\n(1) For \b \r \f: \u000b1 \u0006 [90 \u000e \b]deg and \u000b2 \u0006 [270 \u000e \f]deg\n(2) For \b \u0002 \f: \u000b1 \u0006 [90 \u000e \b]deg and \u000b2 \u0006 [270 \u000e \b]deg\nSince the nucleation of stray grains has been observed to\nbe fairly uniform across the seed perimeter,[2] the focus of\nthe present investigation has been to study the growth of\nthese stray grains. Rather than attempt to count these spu-\nrious grains or report the extent (area fraction on transverse\nsections) to which they manage to grow into the primary\nseed crystal, we instead measure the spatial limits of stray\ncolumnar grains across the perimeter of the seed cross sec-\ntion through the angular limits \t1 and \t2, measured coun-\nterclockwise (Figures 3(b) and (c)). These angles (\t1 and\n\t2) can then be compared to the angles (\u000b1 and \u000b2) that\ndefine where the primary \u0001001\u0002 dendrites diverge or con-\nverge with the vertical mold wall.\n1. Effect of asymmetric thermal environment on stray-\ngrain development\nThe influence of the seed orientation with respect to the\nmold heater\/central sprue on the formation of stray grains\nwas investigated using both cylindrical and truncated cylin-\ndrical seeds. Experiments were carried out with the dispo-\nsition of the off-axis specimens to the furnace geometry\nreversed, i.e.,\nCase 1: Reference flat\/line facing outward toward the\nheater\nCase 2: Reference flat\/line facing inward toward the central\nsprue\nThe results from 12 experiments, six each for cases 1\nand 2, are listed in Table III. The experimentally measured\nangular ranges (\t1 and \t2) within which the stray columnar\ngrains were present on etched macrosections across the seed\nperimeter are tabulated, together with the calculated angular\nrange (\u000b1 and \u000b2) corresponding to the range of primary\n\u0001001\u0002 dendrites intersecting the mold wall at diverging\nangle. The correlation between \u000b1\/\t1 and \u000b2\/\t2 is shown\ngraphically in Figure 4, illustrating that these angles are\ndirectly related, with \u000b1\/\t1 falling above the 1:1 line and\n\u000b2\/\t2 falling below it.\nThere are four specific observations that follow immedi-\nately from the graphical representation in Figure 4 in con-\njunction with the examination of etched seed macrosections.\n(1) The limits \t1 and \t2 are encompassed within the lim-\nits of the angles \u000b1 and \u000b2, i.e., \t1 \u000f \u000b1 and \t2 \r \u000b2.\n(2) This implies that the stray columnar grains across the\nseed perimeter observed on etched macrosections are\nexclusively restricted to where the primary \u0001001\u0002 of\nthe seed crystal forms a diverging disposition with\nrespect to the vertical mold wall.\nFig. 3\u2014(a) Schematic diagram to describe the definition of the crystallo-\ngraphic orientation of the seed.

Effect of primary dendrite orientation\u2014axial\/\nconverging\/diverging\nThe rotation of the seeds on the assembly alters the sense\nof the inclination of the primary stem in relation to the mold\nwall. In the case of the cylindrical seeds with an axisym-\nmetric cross section, a rotation of the seeds on the assem-\nbly retains an invariant cross section with respect to the\nsprue\/heater. This is, however, equivalent to a 180-deg rota-\ntion of the seed configuration (including the reference axes)\nand an accompanying rotation of 180 deg in the viewing\ndirection. The sense of the angles still remains the same.\nHowever, in the case of the truncated cylindrical seeds, the\nspatial orientation of the seed cross section in relation to the\nsprue\/heater changes after a similar rotation.\nIt follows, therefore, from the results of Table III and Fig-\nure 4, that the sense of inclination of the \u0001001\u0002 primary\ndendrite stem in relation to the vertical mold wall has a\nsignificant contribution to the competitive growth of stray\nnucleated crystals at the mold wall. To explore the role of\nthe inclination of the \u0001001\u0002 primary dendrite stem further,\nsimilar experiments were conducted on cylindrical seeds\nhaving axial orientations within \u00012 deg from \u0001001\u0002. Figure 5\nrepresents typical views of the macro-etched section of a\n\u0001001\u0002 axially oriented seed across its cross section. As\nmentioned before, there was no measurement of \b, since the\nseeds had an \u0001\u0001001\u0002 axial orientation.\nThe following can be deduced from a comparison of Table III\nand Figure 5.\n(1) Unlike the off-axial case, where the stray columnar grains\nwere restricted to the diverging \u0001001\u0002 corner of the\nmold wall, for the case of the axial \u0001001\u0002 primary seed\norientations, the columnar grains occur uniformly across\nthe seed perimeter over a shorter distance.\n(2) The equiaxed grains, as before, were not biased toward\nany portion of the seed perimeter.\n(3) The growth potential of the stray columnar grains is\nindependent of the nature and orientation of the seed\ncross section with respect to the heater\/central sprue.\n(4) The occurrence of equiaxed grains is not biased toward\nany portion of the seed perimeter, i.e., they are not\nrestricted to either the converging or diverging corner.\nThe results in Table III and Figure 4 indicate that the\nangular distribution of the stray columnar grains occurs in\na region where the primary \u0001001\u0002 dendrites in the seed\ncrystal are diverging from the cylindrical mold wall, regard-\nless of seed cross section. Hence, the angular region asso-\nciated with the columnar stray grains across the seed\nperimeter is invariant with respect to the inclination (diverg-\ning) of the seed primary \u0001001\u0002 stem with respect to the\nmold wall. It is concluded that any inclination or curvature\nof the liquidus isotherm due to specimen or furnace\n662\u2014VOLUME 36B, OCTOBER 2005 METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS B\nFig. 6\u2014Predicted microstructures for different dendrite orientations during\nseed melt-back under flat isothermal conditions: (a) converging, (b) axial,\nand (c) diverging.III. MODELING INVESTIGATION\nA microscale cellular-automaton\u2013finite-difference (CA-FD)\nmodel was used to simulate the dendritic growth and het-\nerogeneous nucleation during seed melt-back. The model\nsolves for the solute diffusion\u2014controlled growth of cubic\nstructured alloys, predicting the growth of the columnar den-\ndrites from the seed and their competitive growth interac-\ntions with stochastically nucleated stray grains. The stochastic\nnucleation is based on the undercooling of the melt locally\nrelative to that location\u2019s liquidus temperature, accounting\nfor any solute enrichment at that location. The theory, imple-\nmentation, and validation of this model are detailed in prior\npublications[9\u201314] and are not repeated here.\nIn this section, the simulation parameters used in this study\nare first described, and then the model is applied to the predic-\ntion of the microstructures as a function of the seed orientation\nrelative to the wall. Although the model is three-dimensional,\nonly two-dimensional results are presented here, since they are\nsufficient to elucidate the influence of the orientation of the seed\nto the wall as one moves around the periphery of the seed (i.e.,\nfrom a converging to diverging misorientation).\nA. Simulation Parameters\nThe domain size used in all simulations was 3 \u0004 6 mm2, suf-\nficient to approximate the area near the mold wall where stray\ngrains were observed experimentally. In each case, an initial\nfixed spacing of the dendrites in the seed of 350 \u0005m was used;\nhowever, their orientation relative to the isotherms was varied.\nA pseudobinary approximation of CMSX4 was used in the\nsimulation. The equilibrium data were obtained from a lin-\nearized phase diagram for a binary system. The partitioning\ncoefficient (k), diffusion coefficients (D), and slope of the liq-\nuidus (m) were assumed to be constant. The binary Ni-Ta\nphase diagram (initial concentration C0 \u0006 6.5 wt pct, m \u0006\n\u00034.74, and k \u0006 0.70) has been used to describe the solidifi-\ncation characteristics of the superalloy CMSX4. This has been\nconsidered appropriate, since (1) the value of k in the binary\nsystem is similar to the partitioning of Ta in CMSX4, as\nreported elsewhere,[15] and (2) the solidification characteristics\nwill be controlled by the heavy refractory additions, which\nhave sluggish diffusion coefficients (DL \u0001 10\u00039 m2s\u00031).[16]\nA zero-flux boundary condition was applied to the left-\nand right-hand sides of the domain. Simulations were run\nfor a pulling velocity of 100 \u0005m\/s and a thermal gradient\nof 3 K\/mm. Either flat isotherms or curved thermal fields\nwere imposed upon the domain to simulate the thermal con-\nditions experienced during the melt-back process.\nHeterogeneous nucleation was implemented in the CA-\nFD model[14] during the seed melt-back. Nucleation in liq-\nuid occurs when its local undercooling (\u0010TC) exceeds the\ncritical nucleation undercooling (\u0010TN). The propensity for\nstray-grain nucleation requires, therefore, a reliable measure\nof (\u0010TN). Correlation of experimentally observed stray grains\nnucleated at the platform region with the calculated ther-\nmal undercooling indicates that \u0010TN \u0001 (10 to 20) K.[17,18]\nIt must also be borne in mind that nucleation is a stochas-\ntic event. A Gaussian distribution was applied for nucleation\nin this simulation. In the absence of an accurate quantita-\ntive estimate for \u0010TN in CMSX4, the critical nucleation\nundercooling was assumed to be 12.3, with a standard devi-\nation of \n0.4 K and with a nuclei density of 6.5 e1012 m\u00033.\nB. Predicted Undercooling and Microstructure During\nSeed Melt-Back\nSimulations were carried out to investigate the effect of\nthe thermal profile and orientation of primary dendrites on\nthe formation and growth of grains during seed melt-back.\nIn this section, simulated dendritic structures and the amounts\nof undercooling predicted are presented under various ther-\nmal profiles (level and transient isotherms) and different ori-\nentations of the primary dendrites (0 and \n15 deg).\n1. Structure evolution and undercooling under flat\nisotherms\nFlat isotherms are observed for both seeds of small diam-\neter (\u00016 mm)[4] and near the center of the seed during melt-\nback. Simulations were, therefore, carried out under these\nconditions to examine casting characteristics in relation to\nstray-grain formation.\nFigure 6 shows the evolution of the columnar dendrites\ngrowing upward from the bottom of the domain with the\norientations of 0 and \n15 deg, relative to the mold wall on\nthe right-hand side. Since flat isotherms were applied in\nthe simulation, level columnar fronts were observed.

The maximum undercooling\nnear the wall was 9.1 K.\n(2) Axial: All primary dendrites grew at the same rate and\nhad a similar undercooling profile. Their tip undercooling\nwas 9.4 K.\n(3) Diverging: An increasing volume of liquid was formed\nbetween the mold wall and the diverging primary den-\ndrites during growth. A maximum undercooling of\n11.0 K was predicted at the evolving gap, while it was\n9.6 K at the center. If the undercooling was lower than\nthe critical nucleation undercooling, secondary and ter-\ntiary arms developed to fill up the open body of liquid.\nOtherwise, nucleation occurred.\nAlthough the absolute value of these predicted under-\ncoolings depends on estimated model-input parameters, the\noverall trend that the undercooling is highest for diverging\nseed dendrite orientations holds.\n2. Structure evolution and undercooling during the\ninitial thermal transient\nDespite nominal solidification conditions (flat isotherms)\nexisting within the seed, a rapid change in the local columnar-\nfront curvature has been observed during the initial transient\nstages of withdrawal. In fact, quenched directional solidifi-\ncation studies on melted-back seeds in a Bridgman appara-\ntus show a distinct, convex, upward curvature during the\nsoak[4] (Figure 8). The shape of the isotherms can be esti-\nmated from the quenched solid\/liquid interface at the mold\nwall during the initial withdrawal stage. The schematic dia-\ngram in Figure 9(a) shows the initial profile at melt-back\nthat corresponds to Figure 8. During the initial withdrawal\nstage, the heat-transfer mode changes from chill conduction\nto mold-wall radiation, as experimentally observed by\nD\u2019Souza et al. for a similar geometry in a Bridgman appa-\nratus[19] (Figure 9(b)). Therefore, a transient thermal field\nwas imposed upon the domain to simulate the initial stage\nfollowing melt-back.\nThe transient thermal profile and the undercooling ahead\nof the dendritic tip for axial columnar dendrites are shown\nin Figure 10, with isotherms changing from a convex to con-\ncave shape.

The maximum undercoolings corresponding to\nthe different orientations with no nucleation (Figure 11)\nare given in Figure 12. The following observations can be\nmade.\n(1) Converging: The primary dendrites near the mold wall\nwere terminated when they reached the wall. The under-\ncooling ahead of the columnar dendrites in the center\nwas the same as the results under level isothermals. How-\never, the maximum undercooling near the wall was\nincreased to 11.8 K, compared with a general under-\ncooling of 9.1 K. New grains nucleated near the mold\nwall due to the higher undercooling and were overgrown\nby the growing columnar dendrites.\n(2) Axial: The undercooling near the mold wall increased\nto 12.5 K compared with the level isotherms. This is\nbecause columnar dendrites near the mold wall grew at\na higher rate during the transient stage than those under\nlevel isotherms, resulting in a higher undercooling. New\ngrains formed during the transient stage and were over-\ngrown by the columnar dendrites after the transient\nstage.\n(3) Diverging: There is an increasing volume of liquid left\nbetween the mold wall and the diverging primary den-\ndrites during growth. A maximum undercooling of 13.6 K\nwas maintained at the evolving gap, while the under-\ncooling at the center was 9.2 K. Nucleation occurred near\nthe diverging side, as shown in Figure 11(c). The nucle-\nated grains grew to fill the gap between the mold wall\nand the columnar dendrites. Due to the open space of the\ngap left, the stray grains are not likely to be blocked by\nthe original dendrites; therefore, they could grow into the\nsingle-crystal matrix to form columnar grains, as observed\nexperimentally[4] (Figure 1(b)).\nThe simulated results revealed the following.\n(1) The undercooling near the mold wall during the ther-\nmal transient stage is greater than the undercooling under\nlevel isotherms, while the undercooling ahead of the\ncolumnar front in the center of the domain is the same\nas that calculated under level isotherms.\n(2) During the thermal transient stage, the undercooling\nreaches its maximum at the end of the transient stage,\nso the propensity for forming new grains during the ther-\nmal transient stage is high.\n(3) For dendrites with different orientations, the diverging\ncase has the highest undercooling (13.6 K). Therefore,\nthe diverging groove provides a favorite location for\nnucleation and growth of stray grains.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nA. Nucleation of Stray Grains during Seed Melt-Back\nFor nominal solidification conditions (flat isotherm, as\ndescribed in Section III\u2013A), the magnitude of \u0010TC ahead of\nthe columnar front may be insufficient to cause nucleation\nMETALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS B VOLUME 36B, OCTOBER 2005\u2014665\nof stray grains, despite the existence of a large volume of\nsupercooled liquid. However, in the transient stage, the\nlocal solidification conditions experienced by the dendrites\nnear the mold wall are very different than those encoun-\ntered by the primary stems in the center. During the tran-\nsient period, the curvature of the columnar front changes\nfrom a convex to concave shape. With regard to the\nincreased isotherm velocity pertaining to rapid changes in\ngrowth-front curvature, there are four important features\nthat need to be considered:\n(1) The maximum undercooling occurred at the end of the\ninitial transient stage near the mold wall (Figure 9(b)).\nFor axial dendrites, the undercooling near the mold wall\nwas 6.3 K before the initial withdrawal, increased to\n12.5 K at the end of the transient stage, and decreased\nto 10.3 K when the columnar dendrites near the wall\ngrew at the same rate as those in the center.\n(2) The maximum undercooling was predicted for diverging\ndendrites. Predicted maximum undercoolings at the end\nof the transient stage for the converging (\u0007 \u0006 \u000315 deg),\naxial (\u0007 \u0006 0 deg), and diverging (\u0007 \u0006 \u000e15 deg) dendrites\nwere 11.8, 12.5, and 13.6 K, respectively. The under-\ncoolings near the casting center for all dendrite orien-\ntations had a similar value of 9.1 K.\n(3) Undercoolings near the mold wall are greater than those\nat the center; therefore, the propensity of nucleation near\nthe mold wall is greater than at the center.\n(4) The previous simulations agree with experimental\nobservations that the nucleation of stray equiaxed grains\naround the perimeter of the seed (Figure 1(a)) occurs\nwithin a distance of \u00012 mm from the melt-back interface\nand that the stray equiaxed grains do not have an angular\ndependency.\nB. Growth of Stray Grains\nThe evolution of the stray grains is determined by their\ngrowth after nucleation, which is dominated by competitive\ngrowth with the original dendrites. In this section, the impact\nof primary dendrite orientation on the growth of stray grains\nis discussed. There are two distinct categories that deal with\ncompetitive grain growth based on the orientation of the\ndendrites.\n(1) Converging: During the thermal transient stage, the\nexistence of high undercooling provides a favorable\ncondition for nucleation. However, during subsequent\ngrowth, the evolving primary\/secondary dendrite-arm\nnetwork of the columnar dendrites causes a reduced local\nundercooling in the volume of liquid available for the\ngrowth of the stray grain. The space available for the\ngrowth of the stray grains also diminishes as the original\ndendrites grow into the liquid, inhibiting growth of the\nnucleated grains.\n(2) Diverging: A bulk of undercooled liquid exists due to a\ndecreased solutal interaction between primary\/secondary\narms at the diverging groove. Moreover, the highly under-\ncooled region of liquid is retained due to the lag of the\ngrowth front, which provides a favored condition for the\ngrowth of spurious grains. The nucleated grain in the\ndiverging groove has a larger size than those at the axial\nand converging sides and has the potential to grow into\nthe single-crystal matrix. This, therefore, accounts for the\nangular dependence of the occurrence of the stray colum-\nnar grains across the seed perimeter.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nAn experimental study along with a microstructural model\ntreating solute diffusion has been used to address (1) the\nnucleation of stray grains following seed melt-back and the\ninitial withdrawal and (2) the effect of the primary dendrite\ndisposition of the seed with respect to the mold wall on the\ngrowth of stray crystals. The following conclusions were\nreached.\n1. The local thermal conditions at the growth front with\nrespect to the mold heater have minimal influence.\n2. The maximum undercooling is obtained at the end of the\nthermal transient stage.\n3. For seeds with an axial orientation, the stray grains\nnucleated across the seed perimeter exhibit a random\ncolumnar morphology, showing the absence of an angular\nrelationship.\n4. For seeds with an off-axial orientation, the growth of\nnucleated grains is governed by the morphological\nconstraints associated with competitive growth between\nthe nucleated grains and columnar dendrites. At the\nconverging side, the nucleated grains were overgrown by\nthe columnar dendrites after the transient stage and remain\nequiaxed. At the diverging side, the nucleated grains can\ngrow significantly into the single-crystal matrix and\nexhibit a columnar morphology.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors from Imperial College London are thankful\nfor the financial support provided by EPSRC (Grant No.\nGR\/R78992).\nREFERENCES\n1.
