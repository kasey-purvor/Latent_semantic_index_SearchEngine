The everyday has flitted in and out \nof the spotlight of media and cultural studies debates in the past three decades, \nprovoking some of its boldest theoretical gestures (for example, the work of Lawrence \nGrossberg or Janice Radway) and some of its boldest empirical strategies (the work of \nDavid Morley or Roger Silverstone), but hardly any consensus. What these three new \nbooks confirm, at least, is that there is much life left in this debate, but also that it is \nhardly media and cultural studies\u2019 exclusive domain: all three draw on a rich literature \nacross social theory, cultural theory and aesthetic theory and practice. If we wanted a \nstarting-point for assessing what is at stake in media and cultural studies today, we \ncould do worse than choose the concept of everyday life. \n \nIt is Michael Gardiner\u2019s book that provides the fundamental intellectual coordinates \nhere. Gardiner has long been known as a social theorist with particular expertise on \nMikhail Bakhtin\u2019s work, and his impressive book is the fruit of long-term study of \ncritical social theory. By some way the richest in terms of philosophical argument, \nCritiques of Everyday Life provides the framework within which Highmore\u2019s and \nChaney\u2019s books can be best be situated, even if they refer to Gardiner only in passing \n(Gardiner\u2019s book will only have been published in the late stages of completing the \nother two).  \n \nGardiner writes as a social theorist, not an empirical researcher, and the focus of his \nwork is not surprisingly a paradoxical one: \u2018the largely taken-for-granted world that \nremains clandestine, yet constitutes what Lefebvre calls the \u201ccommon ground\u201d or \n\u201ccommon tissue\u201d of all conceivable human thoughts and activities\u2019 (2). The \ntheoretical stakes could hardly be put higher, nor could Gardiner\u2019s investment in the \ntensions within the Western Marxist tradition be clearer. Gardiner is concerned, not \nwith \u2018everyday life\u2019 as a topic for sociological micro-inquiry, but with \u2018everyday life\u2019 \nas a reference-point in critical debates about what is \u2018the social\u2019. As he makes clear, \nthis becomes a burning issue only within a counter-tradition that has already left \n\u2018administrative\u2019 research behind, yet is dissatisfied with how Marx\u2019s own analysis of \nthe everyday closed off various critical, even utopian, possibilities.  \n \nGardiner certainly convinces in arguing that this sustained century-long debate is \nworthy of renewed attention at a time when (although he doesn\u2019t develop the point) \nthe utopian dimension of social and political thought has fallen into deep shadow.1 \nProvocatively, Gardiner starts not with sociology but with art: an excellent chapter on \nthe theoretical underpinnings of Dada and Surrealism that brings out its complicated \nrelationship to Marxism and also to Durkheim. The following chapters offer subtle, \nphilosophically engaged accounts of Mikhail Bakhtin (especially impressive in \ndrawing on Bakhtin\u2019s less known early philosophical work), Henri Lefebvre, \nSituationism, Agnes Heller, Michel De Certeau and finally the radical feminist \nCanadian sociologist Dorothy Smith. These chapters weave together many key issues \nof contemporary sociology: the status of leisure and commodification, the possibility \n(if any) of some sense of social totality, reification and alienation, the role of the \naesthetic and the technological in articulating change. Gardiner\u2019s deliberate (209 n3) \nfocus on less well-known thinkers and traditions is to be welcomed.  \n \nAt the same time, for anyone seeking pointers towards empirical research into the \n\u2018everyday\u2019 his discussion is abstract: for Lefebvre, everyday life is important not for \nits details but as a site of utopian possibility, for the Situationists, as a site of \nsubversive practice, for Heller as a \u2018problematic\u2019 (131) which challenges totalising \ntheories of consciousness and historical materialism, for De Certeau (the counter-\nvoice within this counter-tradition) as the limit to theorising about the social and the \npolitical, and for Smith as the provocation to methodological reflexivity about the \npatriarchal legacy of social inquiry. Extremely well-nuanced as all the discussion is, \nmissing is an attempt by Gardiner to shape his narrative towards the detailed \npossibilities of, and priorities for, empirical research. The lack of an argued \nconcluding chapter means that even the wider theoretical potential of Heller\u2019s \niconoclastic (within a Marxist context) return to Aristotle\u2019s concept of practical \nwisdom for rethinking contemporary morality is left undeveloped.  \n \nAt this point, we see both the strength of Gardiner\u2019s specialised theoretical focus and \nits limitation, which downplays detailed empirical research in favour of a looser sense \nof critical praxis engaged in \u2018the everyday\u2019. As he says, the book\u2019s aim is to \n\u2018constitute a useful resource for further investigations into the theory and practical \ntransformation of everyday life\u2019 (23, added emphasis). But what about empirical \nresearch into how the conditions of \u2018everyday life\u2019 might be changing? For that we \nmust look elsewhere, particularly to Chaney\u2019s book, which I discuss later. \n \nFirst, I want to discuss Ben Highmore\u2019s very illuminating and well-organised new \ntextbook on theorisations of the everyday. Like Gardiner\u2019s, his writing is obviously \nthe product of sustained reflection over many years, something that in an age of \nacademic hyper-production can only be welcomed! Highmore\u2019s passion for the \nsubject and why it matters comes through on every page. The discussions are well-\nsignposted and vivid in their detail while also being consistently scholarly and \nprovocative. All researchers, even those already experts in this difficult terrain, will \ngain from it. In short, it is a model for that little-achieved ideal of text-book writing, \nengaging students who approach the topic for the first time, while making a \nsignificant contribution to academic debate. \n Like Gardiner, Highmore makes clear at the outset that it is a counter-tradition of \nsocial and cultural thought with which he is concerned, a series of \u2018practical, poetic \nand critical operations\u2019 that try \u2018to make the everyday vivid\u2019 (16). Bracketing the \nspecific context of Marxist theory, however, Highmore makes a convincing wider \ncase for why this tradition matters: namely, the sheer difficulty for all social agents in \nmodernity of getting a purchase on general processes of change within a social world \nthat is increasingly mechanised, coordinated and spectacularised. His first chapter is \none of the best introductions I have read to these topics, because it steps outside \nsociological abstraction and brings to life modernity as a question of feeling: not just \nmechanisation, but the problem of boredom, not just rationalisation but the counter-\ntendency towards mystification.  \n \nChapter Two attempts a general framework for the book and is less successful; unlike \nthe rest of the book, it is overwritten but, more important, its apparent \u2018fence-sitting\u2019 \napproach to the ultimate relevance of the topic is unsatisfactory. While to claim that \nthe practice of critique may be premature (27) has some pedigree within cultural \nstudies (for example, Ang, 1985), it cuts across the very point of the tradition \nHighmore describes which is, surely, that critique, far from being premature, is never \nsufficiently present within most experiences of the everyday. I will return to the \nconsequences of this evasion for Highmore\u2019s wider argument later.  \n \nThe detailed chapters which follow are largely successful with only the short early \nchapter on Simmel reading like an addition bolted on for completeness. It is clear that \nHighmore\u2019s theoretical passion lies with French theory, and, most strikingly, its \noverlap with British critical social thought. If Highmore\u2019s attempt to read Simmel \nfrom the point of view of aesthetics is unsatisfactory, more interesting is his insistence \non the concerns of Surrealist thinkers with the problems of social research. Adding \nmuch interesting detail onto the landscape introduced a decade earlier by James \nClifford (1990), Highmore shows the significance of surrealism as a methodology \nwithin critical social thought and a predecessor of the late 20th century crisis in \nethnography. By contrast, Highmore finds Benjamin\u2019s fertile speculations on \ncommodification and everyday life rather evasive in terms of workable theoretical \nconcepts. \n \nThe book\u2019s most striking chapter and its longest is its discussion of the Mass-\nObservation research of the 1930s. Without in any way minimising its contradictions \nand its own evasions, Highmore brings out very well Mass-Observation\u2019s serious \nattempt to generate new facts about one complex modern society undergoing social \nturmoil: 1930s Britain. He explores the tensions between poetical and empirical \napproaches between its main advocates, Tom Harrisson and Charles Madge, and \nrightly rejects crude stereotypes of Mass-Observation as elitist, showing that on the \ncontrary this was a courageous tradition of social research and critical cultural \npractice that tried to address the need for new spaces of expression for those \npreviously excluded from public discourse by reason of class or gender.  \n \nThe last two substantive chapters (on Lefebvre and De Certeau), however, revive the \nambiguity mentioned earlier in Highmore\u2019s own relationship to his topic. Writing \nwithin cultural studies rather than sociology, he seems unwilling to give precedence to \napproaches to the everyday that take their ultimate reference point in a scientific \nmodel of empirical research. So, while his admiring and highly informative chapter on \nLefebvre ends with an apparent endorsement of Lefebvre\u2019s insistence that everyday \nlife is where we should look, as sociologists, for possibilities of resistance to wider \nsocial structures, the following chapter throws more weight behind De Certeau\u2019s \nscepticism about any totalising account of the everyday, including those which claim \nto be politically emancipatory. Instead, Highmore suggests that De Certeau\u2019s self-\nconsciously \u2018poetic\u2019 style is more suited to the fleeting nature of the everyday than \nLefebvre\u2019s, a clear difference from Gardiner\u2019s argument.  The problem, however, is \nthat Highmore\u2019s argument at this point lacks detailed examples, which undermines in \nturn his concluding claim that the critical tradition he explores can be a starting-point \nfor \u2018reimagining cultural studies\u2019 (178): how exactly this reimagining is to work, with \nwhat specific priorities, and with what methodological tools remains unclear.  \n \nIt is precisely this unanswered question, about the potential for a sustained and \nempirically rigorous account of historical changes in the everyday, that David \nChaney\u2019s book Cultural Change and Everyday Life promises to address. Chaney has \nbeen almost unique among British cultural sociologists for his sustained attention to \nmedia\u2019s centrality to the construction of social life in modernity: from his early work \non mediations of royal ritual, to his 1990s work on shopping malls, media fictions and \nthe media\u2019s impacts on everyday self-performance, Chaney has developed a strikingly \noriginal agenda. He is, at first sight, well-placed to provide much-needed empirical \ncontent to the debates about everyday life illuminated more theoretically by Gardiner \nand Highmore.  \n \nCultural Change and Everyday Life begins with a striking and original empirical \nquestions: how is the \u2018fabric of control and order\u2019 in contemporary societies changing \n(vii), particularly societies where the very notion of \u2018everyday life\u2019 is increasingly \nconstructed through \u2018the development and elaboration of a culture of mass \nentertainment\u2019 (1)? While operating within a broadly social constructionist \nframework, Chaney\u2019s position is original in at least two respects: first, in his \ninsistence not on social construction at the level of general ideas but at the level of \nlived, embodied cultural performance and, second, in his insistence (far too rare for \nsocial theorists) on the centrality of media frameworks for circulating new models of \ncultural performance. A difference, however, with his earlier work is that Chaney \nconfronts the contemporary fragmentation of the media landscape: the diffusion of \nmedia\u2019s cultural influences into more individualised distribution streams alongside the \nshift throughout most of the 20th century towards more informal models of political \nand social performance.  The result of these twin processes of \u2018radical \ndemocratisation\u2019 and \u2018cultural fragmentation\u2019 (5), he argues, is that the construction -  \n\u2018everyday life\u2019 - has become increasingly central to wider cultural and social \ndiscourse. So far, his argument offers a chance to address why everyday life might be \nof renewed sociological significance at the start of a new century.  \n \nChaney, however, pushes forward his argument in a very different way from Gardiner \nand Highmore. For Chaney it is not the critical potential of the term \u2018everyday life\u2019 \nthat matters (that is, its role in disrupting established theoretical positions and social \northodoxies) but rather its role as a marker of wider social contests. Everyday life is, \nas it were, the blank sheet, on which countless other tensions and social conflicts are \nprojected, rather than having a critical potential of its own; so there is no problem for \nChaney in defining everyday life \u2013 blandly -  as \u2018that part of our daily activities that is \nso widely shared that it becomes unremarkable\u2019 (34, my emphasis). It is not that he \nneglects the politics of knowledge underlying the construction of such an apparently \nunproblematic object (indeed he brings out well his differences from, for example, \nethnomethodological and symbolic interactionist perspectives on the everyday which \ngive too simple a priority to the supposed immediacies of everyday interaction), but \nrather that for Chaney the possibility has receded of some transcendent critical \nperspective emerging through rival theoretical constructions of the everyday. So, \nwhile Chaney discusses much of the same theoretical terrain as the other two books, it \nis from a very different direction.  \n \nThe question, however, is whether the possible gains (for empirical analysis of \neveryday realities) outweigh the costs of bracketing this critical tradition that has \nhovered above these realities. It is here that I have considerable doubts. Rather than \nfocus on the gaps in Chaney\u2019s theoretical armoury (Bourdieu and Foucault, for \nexample, have only a vestigial presence in his argument), or even its striking \nadditions, such as the concept of \u2018ecology\u2019 which Chaney introduces on page 53, I \nwant to concentrate on the sections of the book which close in more directly on \nempirical research, for example the interesting chapters on fashion and performance \n(Chapter Five), changing forms of authority in public life (Chapter Six) and \u2018the \nextraordinary\u2019 (Chapter Eight). While the question to which Chaney attends \u2013 how \nmight media forms over time be changing what counts as everyday life and how \npeople perform for themselves and others within it? \u2013 is fundamental and neglected, I \nam not convinced that Chaney takes much beyond that starting-point.  \n \nThese chapters raise a number of problems. First, while it is fine to develop an \nargument, as Chaney does, through a secondary discussion of other empirical \nresearch, it is a problem when the speed of discussion becomes detached from all but \nthe most general features of topics discussed. So Chapter 5 moves, apparently without \nfriction, from consumption in general to fashion to food to sport to bodily training to \nhealth and experiences of risk to the \u2018informalisation\u2019 of contemporary culture. \nWhatever apparent plausibility Chaney\u2019s account has comes at the price of leaving \nbehind some concrete questions: what exactly is it that binds together these \nsuperficially diverse topics? If it is a concept as vague as \u2018informalisation\u2019, how can \nwe apply this in a way that is not redundantly true of every contemporary society (and \ntherefore substantively informative about none)? And, most important, where is the \nscope for alternative empirical accounts here: can we assume away in advance the \npossibility that, as some things become more informal, others are more intensely \nformalised? The latter might be an obvious challenge to a focussed empirical account \nbut remains unexplored in the general sweep of Chaney\u2019s review.  \n \nSecond, while Chaney is surely right to raise, particularly in Chapter Six, questions \nabout the changing nature of authority in mass mediated culture, he does little to give \nsubstance or depth to his argument: this is not only because he says very little about \nthe specific dynamics of media institutions and media products themselves (political \neconomy debates hardly get a look in here, although Chaney is no doubt well aware of \nthem) but also because, when he comes to a topic that cries out for some attention to \nquestions of power \u2013 celebrity \u2013 he largely repeats conventional arguments that \ncelebrities offer \u2018spaces\u2019 within which more complex and differentiated personal \nnarratives can develop. The same weakness occurs when Chaney \u2013 again interestingly \n\u2013 raises the question of how the \u2018extraordinary\u2019 is now being reworked alongside the \nordinary in contemporary media cultures. Having raised this point, Chaney\u2019s own \naccount of mediated versions of the extraordinary has little concrete to say (nothing \nfor example about fan practices and their power dynamics) and soon moves onto the \ndistant topic of drug use.  \n \nThird, and finally, there is no sense in Chaney\u2019s account that narratve and everyday \nlife might be a source of tension and difficulty in contemporary life: no sense that \npeople\u2019s ability to tell effective narratives of their everyday lives at work, for \nexample, might be under threat (but see Sennett, 1999); no sense of the contradictions \nwithin people\u2019s uses of commercial culture for self-performance ((but see Skeggs, \n1997; Young, 1999). The great debate in 20th century social and cultural thought \nabout the status of everyday life here ends, I regret to say, with a whimper. It is \nbecause they insist otherwise, that, for this reader at least, Highmore\u2019s, and especially \nGardiner\u2019s, books are of lasting importance, not least as a provocation to new and \ncritical empirical work on the everyday conditions under which experience and power \nare being produced and reproduced. \n \nNICK COULDRY [2864 words] \n \nReferences \n \nAng, I.
