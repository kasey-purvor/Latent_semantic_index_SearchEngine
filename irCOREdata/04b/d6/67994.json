Yet the factors responsible for shaping performance in the complex \nspan tasks used to assess working memory capacity are not fully understood. \nWe report a study of reading span in 7- to 11-year old children that addresses \nseveral contemporary theoretical issues. We demonstrate that both the timing \nand the accuracy of recall are affected by the presence or absence of a semantic \nconnection between the processing requirement and the memoranda.  Evidence \nthat there can be synergies between processing and memory argues against the \nview that complex span simply measures the competition between these \nactivities.  We also demonstrate a consistent relationship between the rate of \ncompleting processing operations (sentence reading) and recall accuracy. At the \nsame time, the shape and strength of this function varies with the task \nconfiguration.  Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential for \nreconstructive influences to shape working memory performance among \nchildren. \n \n 3 \nSynergies between processing and memory in children\u2019s reading span \n \nWorking memory has been described as \u201cthe ability to simultaneously \nmaintain and process goal-relevant information\u201d (Conway, Jarrold, Kane, Miyake, \n& Towse, 2007) and similarly, albeit in more metaphorical terms, as \u201cthe \nworkbench of cognition\u201d (Klatzky, 1980). Both descriptions draw attention to the \nnotion of active memory processes that go beyond just maintenance of \ntemporary information over short intervals.  Accordingly, considerable effort has \nbeen invested in developing and testing tasks that combine the maintenance and \nprocessing of information.  In this paper, we demonstrate that the relationship \nbetween processing and memory among children may be much more subtle and \nmulti-faceted than commonly recognised, with implications for the construct of \nworking memory capacity and its known links to wider achievement domains.  \nThe original logic behind the family of complex span tasks known as \nworking memory span (Daneman and Carpenter, 1980) was that they required \nsimultaneous processing and memory operations, in contrast to simple span \ntasks such as word span that focus only on memory (although see Colom, \nRebollo, Abad & Shih, 2006 for a recent interpretation of this distinction). For \nexample in reading span, a participant processes a sequence of sentences for \ncomprehension and then attempts to remember a word allied to each sentence, \nand in counting span, a participant determines the numerosities of a sequence of \n 4 \nvisual arrays and then attempts to remember all the count totals (Case, Kurland \n& Goldberg, 1982).  Working memory span reflects the upper limit on the number \nof target items, words or count totals in these examples, that can be recalled in \nsequence (see Conway et al., 2005, and Friedman & Miyake, 2005, for \ndiscussion of different indices of memory performance). \nEarly theoretical accounts of what determines working memory span \nemphasised the notion of limited cognitive resources shared between processing \nand memory demands (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980; Case et al., 1982). \nAccording to this resource-sharing framework, processing (e.g. reading \ncomprehension or counting) and memory (retention of some accompanying \nmemoranda) requirements are serviced by a common limited capacity system, \nwhich results in a trade-off in resources. Thus span reflects the balance between \nprocessing and memory processes.  This theoretical perspective emphasises the \nassumption that there is a strong, direct, and competitive relationship between \nprocessing and retention in working memory (Daneman & Hannon, 2001). \nSubsequent accounts have challenged the ubiquity and generality of the \nresource-sharing view among children. Towse & Hitch (1995) manipulated a \ncounting span task in terms of both processing difficulty (the amount of resources \nrequired to support processing) and processing duration (the exposure of the \nmemoranda to forgetting processes). Children obtained lower span scores when \nthe processing was harder, but this effect disappeared when controlling for the \n 5 \nduration of processing (see also Ransdell & Hecht, 2003; Barrouillet & Camos, \n2001, Expt. 1 & 2).  These results suggested that processing time was more \nimportant than processing intensity in shaping absolute levels of complex span. \nThe findings motivated a 'task-switching' hypothesis, according to which \nprocessing and memory are sequential rather than simultaneous activities and \nmemory representations become less accessible during time devoted to \nprocessing operations (Towse, Hitch & Hutton, 1998; and for attempts to \ncompare and integrate resource-sharing and time-dependent approaches, see \nBarrouillet, Bernadin, & Camos, 2004; Jarrold & Bayliss, 2007; Towse, Hitch & \nHorton, 2007). \nThe current study does not focus solely on the contrast between these \naccounts, but instead draws on conceptual threads relevant to both and argues \nfor more richly elaborated models of working memory. In particular we identify \nthree separate yet connected research issues addressed in the current empirical \nwork. These three issues focus on the specification of the functional relationship \nbetween processing duration and recall accuracy, the reconstruction of recallable \nitems, and the relevance of stimulus similarity for recall performance. We \naddress each of these in turn. \nThe relationship between processing duration and recall accuracy \nThe major theoretical positions outlined above also make predictions for \nindividual differences in recall ability as a function of the time occupied by \n 6 \nprocessing operations. For example, if sequence accessibility is compromised by \nprotracted processing requirements, then participants with relatively a slow \nprocessing speed - who thereby are faced with a longer retention time for a given \nset of materials - should remember less. Indeed, Towse et al. (1998) found that \nless efficient processing was associated with lower counting spans, operation \nspans and reading spans among 8- to 11-year-old children. Likewise, Jarrold and \nBayliss (2007) discuss the outcome of multiple studies in which processing tasks \nwere completed on their own as well as when combined with memory \nrequirements in complex span.  They conclude that processing time is one (albeit \nnot the only) predictor of recall performance. \nDoes the same relationship between speed and span hold across different \nworking memory tasks or domains? In other words, is the rate of forgetting \nequivalent irrespective of the nature of processing? This issue speaks to whether \nthere a single functional relationship linking the task elements among children. \nThe task-switching model outlined above suggests only that information loss \noccurs when one is \u2018switched out\u2019 of memory activities; the precise rate of this \nloss may be dependent on a range of potential factors such as the potency of \nintra-list interference (Hitch, Towse, & Hutton, 2001) or the endurance of memory \nrepresentations (Towse, Hitch, Hamilton, Peacock & Hutton, 2005). In contrast, \nresource-sharing views in which processing time is a proxy for the amount of \n 7 \nresources consumed by processing (see e.g. Case et al., 1982) come closer to \npositing a single function. \nA single function is explicit in the time-based resource-sharing model \n(Barrouillet et al., 2004) according to which span is a function of the cognitive \nload of a task, indexed by the duration of attentional capture while performing \nprocessing operations divided by the total trial time (see also Barrouillet & \nCamos, 2007). However it is important to note that evidence for this model arises \nparticularly from paradigms that involve discontinuous processing tasks such as \npaced digit naming that leave unfilled intervals, unlike the more continuous \nprocessing and retention cycle typical of complex span paradigms. The model \nassumes that slower processing both increases forgetting due to decay during \nprocessing operations and decreases the opportunity to refresh memory traces \nduring unfilled intervals. It thus emphasizes micro task-switching phenomena \nwithin processing and retention episodes as well as macro task switching \nbetween these dimensions (Towse & Hitch, 2007). \nWhilst there are some correspondences between this and the task-\nswitching model, the time-based resource sharing model differs because it (a) \naccounts for recall purely terms of temporal parameters during encoding and (b) \nspecifies a detailed role for unfilled time in intermittent processing tasks. In \ncontrast the task-switching model acknowledges that forgetting may be due to \nfactors such as interference besides or instead of decay and was not specified to \n 8 \nconsider unfilled intervals into complex span tasks (although see Towse, Hitch & \nHutton, 2002, for some elaborations). \nHitch et al. (2001) reported data from operation span (simple arithmetic \nsums were solved and the answers retained) and reading span (unfinished \nsentences were read and the completion word retained) administered to 8 \u2013 11-\nyear-old children. In both cases, the time to complete the processing component \nof the task was negatively correlated with span. However, the slope of the best-\nfitting line was steeper for operation span than for reading span. A single slope \naccount of performance did not fit the data. Hitch et al. (2001) interpreted these \nresults in terms of task-switching, suggesting rates of forgetting that differed for \neach type of processing activity.  \nHowever, reading and operation span also differ in the nature of the \nmemoranda (words and numbers) and the mean length of sequence recalled \n(since operation span scores were generally higher). Thus the findings need not \nbe incompatible with a cognitive load explanation since different processing \nactivities are called upon and thus the extent of attentional capture may be \ndifferent. In the present research, we consider the speed\u2013span relationship for \ntwo working memory tasks that involve the same processing component \n(sentence completion) and equivalent memory stimuli (words unique to each \ntrial). We argue that this makes for a much more compelling examination of the \nsingle slope assumption. \n 9 \nThe reconstruction of recallable items \nCowan et al. (2003) also considered the temporal dynamics of complex \nspan, yet the focus was on the timing of recall. The pauses between words in \nchildren\u2019s and adults' reading span were found to be much longer than is \ncommonly found in simple span memory tasks. Long interword pauses during \nrecall were also characteristic of listening span (verification of heard sentences) \nbut less so for counting span. Cowan et al. argued that the greater length of \nreading \/ listening span pauses indicated that participants could use information \nfrom linguistic processes to scaffold recall of the target words during output. The \nshorter interword pauses in counting span were attributed to the low \ndistinctiveness of the processing operations associated with each target item in \nthis paradigm, rendering ineffective a reliance on memory from processing. \nTowse, Cowan, Hitch & Horton (2008) provided more direct evidence that \nadults\u2019 reading span incorporated reconstructive processes during recall. Over a \nseries of experiments, they compared two reading span configurations; one in \nwhich the memoranda were sentence words and thus integrated with processing \ncontent, and another in which memoranda were words unrelated to the \nsentences and thus independent of processing content. In the former condition, \nparticipants can potentially use memories of the sentence content to facilitate \nrecall of target words. However, this is not plausible in the latter case since there \nis nothing inherent in any memory of the sentence to cue the target word.  \n 10 \nTowse et al. (2008) consistently found that recall accuracy was higher and \ninterword pauses were longer in the integrated condition than independent \ncondition. This supported the recall reconstruction hypothesis, the notion that \nwhen the opportunity exists, memory for processing operations can be used to \nrevive or corroborate memory for target items. Importantly, this challenges the \ncommon assumption identified earlier that any relationship between processing \nand memory in working memory tasks is necessarily competitive. Towse et al. \nargue instead that, depending on the nature of the task, there may be a \ncooperative relationship between processing and memory in complex span.  In \nthe present research, we therefore analyse the chronometry of recall for \nintegrated and independent reading span formats among children; this allows us \nto identify whether patterns of adult performance are replicated in children, or \nalternatively whether reconstructive processes are the result of a mature strategy \nseen only in adults. \nIn this context, it is worth noting that Unsworth and Engle (2007) have \nproposed that adult individual differences in complex span are related to the \ndistinction between primary and secondary memory processes. They argue that \ncentral to complex span performance is the need to regulate search strategies \nefficiently in secondary memory (see also Healey & Miyake, 2009). The recall \nreconstruction hypothesis shares several features with this approach, in \nparticular focusing on cued recall utilizing multiple source representations. A \n 11 \ncomparison between these theoretical accounts also emphasises that even \nthough the present research design focuses on semantic support for memory \nfrom sentences, reconstruction of output is a more general process that can \ninvolve search on a range of different coding dimensions \nStimulus similarity in working memory span \nConlin, Gathercole & Adams (2005) draw attention to yet another aspect of \nthe relationship between processing and recall. They argued that working \nmemory span can be affected by the similarity or overlap between the content of \nprocessing and memoranda (for a wider perspective from adult data, see \nOberauer, Lange & Engle, 2004). They asked children to carry out a reading \nspan or operation span task (i.e. involving linguistic and numerical processing \ndomains respectively) with either words or numbers as memory stimuli. They \nfound superior levels of recall when the content of processing and the \nmemoranda were categorically distinct (i.e., reading span coupled with recall of \nnumbers or operation span coupled with recall of words) and argued that \nprocessing operations have greater interfering power when they overlap with the \nrepresentations of items held in memory (see also Saito & Miyake, 2004).  \nThe memorial advantage for items from a distinct stimulus class occurred \neven though reading span involved memory for sentence completion words \n(Expt. 1). Conlin et al. pointed out that sentence memory ought to have helped \nrecall of within-category items here, and this was taken as a lack of evidence for \n 12 \nreconstructive processes. However, while the case for the potential relevance of \nwithin-domain interference is well made, we view these results as equivocal with \nrespect to the contribution of recall reconstruction processes in reading span.  \nThis is because Conlin et al.\u2019s design confounds the manipulation of stimulus \nsimilarity (whether the memoranda share the same stimulus class as processing \nevents) with the presence or absence of semantic links between processing and \nmemory.  \nIn the current study, since we compare integrated and independent task \nformats for reading span alone, we isolate the opportunity for reconstructive \nprocesses using a consistent stimulus class for memoranda. Indeed, if stimulus \nsimilarity alone is paramount in determining recall performance, there is an \nargument that children will recall fewer items from the integrated condition, since \nthere is more overlap (i.e. opportunity for confusion) between processing content \nand memoranda than for the independent condition.  \nSummary \nIt is possible to understand many current views of working memory capacity \nin terms of a competitive relationship between processing and storage elements \nof complex span.  This holds whether one suggests processing consumes \nresources that would otherwise be available for retention, or occupies time during \nwhich memory traces degrade due to decay or interference through the \nprevention of active maintenance.  A general limitation in such approaches is that \n 13 \nthey have not been elaborated to identify exactly which aspects of processing are \nrelevant to the fate of memoranda. \nThey are all broadly consistent with evidence for negative correlations \nbetween processing duration and recall accuracy in complex span tasks.  \nHowever, among many questions left open is whether there is a common \nfunction relating processing time and recall across different tasks. The formal \nspecification of recall within the time-based resource-sharing model points to a \nsingle quantitative relationship between processing time and memory \nperformance - but Hitch et al., 2001 provide a potential exception to this.  Recent \nadult research offers an additional perspective too, in showing that reading span \ncan involve substantial reconstructive processes, leading to a cooperative \nrelationship between processing and retention.   \nThe current study paves the way for a careful consideration of these issues \nby examining the relationship between processing time and reading span as a \nfunction of whether the target memory items are related to the processing \noperations or unrelated. Studying children and measuring the temporal dynamics \nof the recall process allows us to generalise previous findings obtained with \nadults and assess whether they reflect use of mature strategies.  Moreover, \nmanipulating the overlap between the content of processing and the target item \nwill provide more detailed data on the role of stimulus similarity in complex span \n(Conlin et al., 2005).  The ages sampled here encompass a much-studied cohort \n 14 \nwith respect to the development of complex memory span and thus speak to an \nexisting research literature. Moreover, reading skills should be sufficiently \nadvanced to enable reading span tasks to be widely administered without the \nprocessing requirements being prohibitively demanding for many children. \nMethodologically, previous research has shown that children often do not \nprogress beyond correct recall of more than 3 item sequences in reading span \n(e.g. Towse, Cowan, Horton, & Whytock, 2008). Therefore, to facilitate task \nadministration, we presented children with two-item and three-item memory \nsequences, rather than attempting to identify span length for each child. This \npermits greater focus on performance-critical sequences. \nMethod \nParticipants. The study involved 108 participants organised into three age \ngroups by school class (36 children per group); the youngest group had a mean \nage of 7 years 7 months (ranging between 7;0 and 8;1), the intermediate group \nhad a mean age of 9 years 0 months (ranging between 8;4 and 9;9) and the \nolder group had a mean age of 10 years 8 months (ranging between 10;0 and \n11;2). Children were assigned at random to the integrated and independent word \ncondition with half the children in each condition. \nStimuli. The sentence stimulus pool comprised a corpus of 88 sentences \n(based on medium-length stimuli described in Towse, Hamilton, Hitch & Hutton, \n2000). The stimulus pool was divided into two equal subsets, one of which \n 15 \n(allocated at random) was used to generate the 25 test sentences for each child. \nSentences typically contained 8-10 words and had been formulated to elicit \ntarget completion words reliably (e.g., \"While I was sleeping I had a strange\" \nusually leads to the completion response \"dream\"). Independent words were \nyoked to each sentence and checked to minimise any obvious semantic \nrelationship. They were drawn from the alternate set of sentence items, ensuring \nthat across children, independent and integrated memoranda were the same. \nApparatus. Computer events were driven by an Apple Macintosh ibook G4 \n(programmed using the \u201cRevolution\u201d language running under OS X) with \nresponse latencies measured in (1\/60 s) ticks. Audio recordings were captured \ndirectly to minidisk (Sony MZ-N710, with a Sony ECM-DS70P microphone). \nProcedure \nChildren were assigned to either the integrated or the independent \ncondition. Once they had been introduced verbally to the task requirements by \nthe experimenter, they were given a practice sentence to read (as the sole task). \nOn each experimental trial, a sequence of two or three incomplete sentences \nappeared sequentially on screen. Participants read each sentence aloud and \ngenerated an appropriate completion word. In the integrated condition, this final \nword formed the memorandum, and after they had announced their choice this \nword appeared and there was a 1 sec interval before the next sentence or the \n 16 \nrecall cue appeared1. In the independent condition, once children completed the \nsentence, the memorandum appeared (in purple) for .75 s surrounded by a 1.25 \ns ISI during which time children were asked to read the memorandum, before the \nnext sentence or the recall cue appeared. \nFollowing the visual recall cue (accompanied by an auditory tone), children \nattempted serial recall of the memoranda. Trials commenced with 5 sets of 2-\nsentence sequences, followed by 5 sets of 3-sentence sequences. Participants \nknew the list length prior to each trial. \nResults \nDevelopmental changes in reading span and the effect of integrated vs. \nindependent processing  \nA number of different measures of recall accuracy have been constructed \nreflecting both maximum sequence length and words recalled in serial order \n(Conway et al., 2005; Friedman & Miyake, 2005). Given that we administered \nonly two sequence lengths, we report recall accuracy in Table 1 as the total \nnumber of words recalled in the correct serial position, with a theoretical range \nbetween 0 and 25. Analysis on memory performance with age and semantic \nconnection as factors, confirmed substantially higher levels of recall in the \n                                            \n1 Only very rarely did children produce an alternative completion; the experimenter \nwould read out the memorandum preceded by \u201cOr...\u201d to underscore the visually shown \nword as the memory target. \n 17 \nintegrated word condition, F(1,102)=29.7, p<.001, \u03b7p2=.226, and among older \nchildren, F(2,102)=11.8, p<.001, \u03b7p2=.188. The interaction between these factors \nwas not significant, F(2,102)=1.36, p=.261, \u03b7p2=.026. \nThe relationship between processing speed and recall ability \nThe data analysed by Hitch et al. (2001) considered the functional \nrelationship between processing time and memory recall with respect to cross-\nsectional and longitudinal differences in children\u2019s ages. Using group means, \nthey found two \u2018developmental growth curves\u2019 with operation span changing \nmore rapidly as a function of processing time than reading span. We have \nreplotted those original data at the level of individual children (data points \naveraged across multiple tasks) expressed as z-scores so that they can be \ncompared more easily across materials and sample. The data are shown in \nFigure 1. \nThe function for operation span (y) involved a regression line with  \ny = -.593(x) + .294 \nwhere x is the time to complete an arithmetic sum. The corresponding \nfunction for reading span (y) is also reported, and the regression line in this case \nwas  \ny = -.267(x) - .444 \nwhere x is the time to comprehend and complete a sentence. The figure \nand regression equations indicate that the slope is more shallow (less than half \n 18 \nthe gradient) in the case of the reading span task, but does not address whether \nthis might be a range effect. \nCorresponding analysis on the current dataset was also based on \nprocessing times and recall accuracy (the number of words recalled correctly and \nin serial order). The time to complete sentence reading was screened for outliers, \nby examining the z-score distribution for the corpus of sentences at each serial \nposition. Reading times of z>3.29 were trimmed back (Winsorized) to the \nthreshold interval. Sentence durations were then averaged across serial position \nand trial for each child. Finally, this dataset was converted to z-scores. \nIn the independent condition, where memoranda are unrelated to the \nsentences processed, the relationship between processing and memory is best \ndescribed by the regression equation \ny = -.412(x) - .412 \nData from the integrated condition, in which memoranda came from the \nend-of sentence words were best fit by the following linear regression function \ny = -.730(x) + .409 \nScatterplots for both conditions are shown in Figure 2 along with the best-\nfitting regression line. In both cases there is a negative slope showing that \nchildren with longer processing times recalled less information. This provides \ngeneral confirmation of previous results. We address two issues in the specific \nfunctions mapping recall to processing time.  \n 19 \nFirst is the comparison between integrated and independent conditions. As \ncaptured by the regression equations, the slope gradient was steeper (almost \ntwice as large) in the integrated condition. A Chow test compared the equality of \nregression parameters, with respect to both the intercept and the slope values. \nThis confirmed differences between the conditions, F(2,103)=21.9, p<.001, \n\u0394R2=.204. Specific comparisons indicated differences in the slopes, t(103)=2.50, \np=.014, \u03b72=.057, with a greater rate of change in the integrated condition. There \nwas also a difference in the intercepts, t(103)=4.45, p<.001, \u03b72=.184, reflecting \nsuperior recall in the integrated condition. \nSecond, we consider the current dataset in relation to Hitch et al. (2001). \nWhilst both are described as z-scores to make comparisons easier, the gradients \nin the current dataset are steeper, as shown in Table 2, which also describes the \ncorrelation between recall and processing time.  \nThere is consistency across datasets in terms of the strength of association \nbetween recall accuracy and processing time. Where the task affords the \nopportunity for processing content usefully to scaffold recall, the association is \nstronger. Thus, the correlation -and R2 fit values in Figures 1 and 2- are higher \nfor integrated compared with independent formats in the current data, and \nreading span compared with operation span formats for Hitch et al. (2001). Thus, \nprocessing duration is a more accurate predictor of recall when the activity is \nrelevant to recall and plausibly supports it.  \n 20 \nThere is a different pattern of alignment with respect to the slope parameter \nor rate of forgetting. Hitch et al.\u2019s reading span task involved an integrated word \nformat and so one might anticipate similar performance to the current integrated \ncondition. Yet the slope for the integrated word condition was steep, significantly \nmore so than in the independent word condition. We therefore suggest that when \nthe memoranda are linked to the sentences that have been read, the impact of \nprocessing time differences is especially systematic and dramatic. In contrast, in \nthe independent word condition (where children cannot easily draw on the \nsentences as a reconstructive aid), alternative memory strategies may be at play. \nWhilst these are affected by reading time - since the correlation is non-zero - its \nimpact is less dramatic.  \nThe chronometry of recall \nRecall times were extracted from correctly recalled trial sequences (leading \nto less data from 3-word than 2-word sequences). This ensured that item \nproduction and pause latencies reflected successful processes, and avoided \nbiases from erroneous recalls that are differentially distributed in frequency \nacross the study data. Additionally, some data were excluded because recall \ntiming was \u2019contaminated\u2019 (e.g., when a participant restarted their list or asked for \nclarification about recall, or when the participant initiated recall before the recall \nsignal, thereby rendering the preparatory interval inappropriate). \n 21 \nSpoken recall was segmented into three contiguous phases (see, for \nexample, Cowan et al., 1998); (a) the preparatory interval; the time between the \nrecall signal and the start of recall, (b) word durations; the time to articulate the \nrelevant words and (c) interword pauses; the gaps between recall words. A single \ntrained researcher extracted timing values2. Specific recall time segments were \nscreened for outliers by examining z-score distributions of each time \nmeasurement; an outlier was labelled as such when z>3.29, and outliers were \ntrimmed back to the relevant time limit. Table 3 reports the sample sizes \navailable for analysis and Figure 3 shows the duration of each recall component, \ncollapsed across age because of small sample sizes in some experimental cells. \nFocusing on the interword pause in two-word sequences, there were \nsignificantly longer pauses in the integrated compared with the independent \ncondition, F(1,70)=7.26, p=.009, \u03b7p2=.094. There was also a marginal age effect \nwith older children producing quicker responses, F(2,70)=2.96, p=.059, \u03b7p2=.078, \nbut no reliable interaction, F(2,70)=1.73, p=.184, \u03b7p2=.047. There were fewer \ncorrect three-word sequences for analysis. Nonetheless, the first interword pause \nwas significantly longer in the integrated compared with the independent \n                                            \n2 A sample of blind timings were compared using an independent coder working with a \nseparate dataset. Measurements were highly correlated (for a sample of 101 interval \nmeasurements, r(99)=.999) and matched in absolute terms (mean gap lengths differed by \nless than 10 ms). \n 22 \ncondition, F(1,24)=5.99, p=.022, \u03b7p2=.200 [with no significant age effect, F<1, \np=.857, \u03b7p2=.013,  or interaction, F<1, p=.851, \u03b7p2=.013]. The second interword \npause was also significantly longer in the integrated condition, F(1,25)=6.55, \np=.017, \u03b7p2=.208 [again with no age effect, F<1, p=.838, \u03b7p2=.014,  or interaction, \nF<1, p=.702, \u03b7p2=.028]. \nFinally, we examined individual differences in output timing and recall. \nConsistent with other studies investigating the chronometry of recall, response \naccuracy was negatively correlated with the length of the interword pause in two-\nword and three-word sequences, r(73)=-.261, p=.037 and r(28)=-.133, p=.483 \nrespectively.3 Neither the interword pauses, nor the overall recall duration, \ncorrelated with the time to complete the sentence processing requirements (all \nrs<.182). In other words, the chronometry of recall is not just a global speed-of-\nprocessing variable, but instead reflects process-specific events. \nIn summary, the data reveal that accompanying higher levels of recall in the \nintegrated condition, there were longer pauses between the correct production of \n                                            \n3 Since these outcomes may have been modulated by the principal experimental \nvariable (which as already reported affects both accuracy and pauses) we \nrepeated these analyses separately for each condition. With independent words, \nthe recall pause - accuracy relationship was negative and non-significant for both \ntwo- and three-word sequences, With integrated words, the two-word correlation \nwas negative, and the three-word correlation positive, yet neither was significant. \n 23 \nwords, at each of the sequence lengths analysed. At the level of individual \ndifferences, there was a tendency for faster retrieval to be associated with better \nrecall, but this was a small effect and reliable only for the shorter (initial) trials. \nDiscussion \nWe introduced and motivated the present study by focusing on three \nquestion domains in the research literature. To structure the discussion, we \ntherefore turn to each of these areas specifically, and then conclude by offering \nmore integrative comments. \nThe relationship between processing duration and recall accuracy \nThe data reconfirm the systematic and consistent relationship that exists \nbetween processing time and memory performance in children\u2019s working \nmemory, which is consistent with other datasets (e.g. Hitch et al., 2001; Bayliss \net al., 2003). At the same time, it contrasts with data from adults, where \nexperiments have concluded that processing time does not correlate with recall \naccuracy (e.g. Towse et al, 2000). Importantly, the present data show more \nsubtle phenomena than simply a contrast between the presence \/ absence of a \nspeed \/ span relationship. Results demonstrate this relationship is not the same \nfor all versions of reading span task as there are differences between the \nintegrated word format and the independent word format, both with respect to the \nstrength of the relationship and the form of the relationship (the gradient of \nchange in recall as a function of processing length).  \n 24 \nThese results have implications for a number of theoretical accounts of \nworking memory. In particular, it provides an exception to the \u2018single slope\u2019 \nassumption relating span to processing time (Barrouillet et al., 2004; Case et al., \n1982) and suggests that this assumption may need to be reconsidered or its \ngenerality curtailed. More generally, the data provide a challenge to the notion of \nprocessing time as a proxy for a global measure such as resource utilisation. \nSuch a stance may certainly retain important heuristic value. Yet when examined \nin detail, this leaves important questions unaddressed. In essence, such global \napproaches to understanding the temporal context of children\u2019s working memory \ntasks are not sufficiently rich to satisfactorily account for working memory \nperformance. We consider two aspects to this argument. \nFirst, the current findings demonstrate that processing activity not \nnecessarily in conflict with the retention of experimentally defined target \nmemoranda. Instead, we argue that there may be cooperative or symbiotic forces \nthat can link memory with processing content. Consequently it is important to \nappreciate what processing takes place in addition to just how long for. \nSecond, the present data converge with other recent work (e.g., Cowan et \nal. 2003; Towse, Cowan et al., 2008) in demonstrating a distinction to be made \nbetween effects of time in the maintenance phase as well as the recall phase. In \nthe former case, when memory activities occur alongside ongoing cognition, \nfaster processing is beneficial since participants arrive at the point of recall with a \n 25 \nmore functional \/ better preserved ensemble of representations. Yet in the latter \ncase, with respect to the comparison of integrated and independent formats at \noutput, slower processing accompanies better recall. Such findings are not \nnecessarily in conflict with each other. During sentence presentation and \ncomprehension, processing can be thought of, loosely, as restricting the \nopportunity for memory activities. At recall also, a swift sequence production is in \ngeneral a chronometric signature of highly accessible memories. With respect to \nsequence production in the integrated condition, however, where the processing \ncontent has relevance for the to-be-recalled items, slower processing can reflect \na beneficial, that is facilitative cognitive process. Here, the delays in response \nproduction are consistent with participants utilising contextual information to \nincrease the accuracy of recall. \nWe therefore suggest that holistic approaches to conceptualising \nprocessing times are likely to struggle in explaining the true complexities of the \nempirical data (noting also evidence that performance is not static, but changes \nas a function of task experience; Towse, Cowan, Horton et al., 2008). The \ntrajectory of memory representations over time (ie. the fidelity of memory \nrepresentations) differs according to the semantic richness of those \nrepresentations. This variable also affects the strength of the processing speed- \nrecall accuracy correlations. When the representations are isolated words and \nare not anchored in any natural way to the sentence reading that occurs \n 26 \nalongside, then the contribution of processing time to individual differences in \nrecall is both relatively small and relatively \u201cgentle\u201d. When the representations \nare semantically bound to the accompanying processing (when sentence \ncomprehension is relevant to items designated as memoranda), the contribution \nof processing time to individual differences in recall is both larger and is more \nharmful to recall. \nThe data do not permit a definitive explanation about cognitive processes \nhere. We suggest, however, that with integrated words children have multiple \nrepresentations, not just of the memoranda but also from the sentences too. \nPerhaps with integrated words, efficient readers generally develop stronger \nrepresentations that support effective memory, leading to a tight relationship \nbetween variables in this condition. As a consequence there is more information \nto lose and recall performance is especially hurt by retention delays. In the \nindependent condition, representations may be more sparse, and therefore other \nstrategies may be used to keep memoranda active, such as item \/ sequence \nrehearsal. As a result, the contribution of processing length may be less critical \nthan other, strategy-specific factors that shape recall success. Above and beyond \nthese details, the subtlety of the data reinforce the need to weave different \nexplanatory strands together to understand the temporal dynamics of working \nmemory span. \nThe reconstruction of recallable items \n 27 \nTowse, Cowan, Hitch et al. (2008) found that, among adults, reading span \nbenefits from the presence of a semantic connection between the content of \nprocessing and the memoranda. There are longer pauses in sequence recall, \nwhich offers converging evidence that memoranda are produced with the aid of \nadditional time-consuming recall processes. The present data demonstrate a \ndevelopmental continuity since a semantic link between processing and retention \nfacilitates recall among children of different ages and the effect is statistically \nequivalent for 7- as well as 11-year-olds. Moreover, we obtained a statistically \nlarge effect with respect to the interword pause difference between integrated \nand independent word formats. Thus the present findings are taken to suggest \nthat in the integrated condition children reconstruct recall items rather than utilise \na complete and fully-assembled memory sequence. \nIn the present experiment, participants remembered either the words they \ngenerated to complete the sentences or separate, unrelated items. This raises \nthe question; is item generation or the presence of a semantic connection the \nrelevant factor that produces the recall time\/accuracy profile? Towse, Cowan, \nHitch et al. (2008) found an effect of semantic relatedness among adults \nirrespective of whether or not participants remembered self-generated items \n(though generation may have contributed to the magnitude of phenomena). \nThus, it appears implausible to attribute the current effect to self-generation \nalone. Moreover, explanations of the generation effect actually overlap with recall \n 28 \nreconstruction, in that generation processes may enhance and enrich the \nrepresentation of the memoranda. \nIt is not claimed that reconstruction occurs for every item in the recall \nsequence, just that it is detectable in the aggregate of performance. Nor have we \nconsidered performance of still younger children, who are less likely to \nspontaneously engage in strategic behavior in immediate serial recall (Flavell, \nBeach, & Chinsky, 1966). Nonetheless, the current study demonstrates that \nwhen the opportunity arises children consider a much richer set of \nrepresentations than just experimentally defined memoranda.  \nIt is also important to note that the representations supporting recall may \nwell go beyond episodic information about earlier processing; this contextual \ndimension has simply been the vehicle by which we have explored the general \nprinciple. We suggest that there can be multiple sources of reconstructive \ninformation in working memory and information from processing may just be one \nthat is highly salient to individuals when the task has an integrated format. Thus, \nthe principle of reconstruction emerges from the more general proposition that in \nworking memory tasks, memoranda may not be actively and continuously \nmaintained throughout the retention interval (Cowan et al., 2003; Haarmann, \nDavelaar & Usher, 2003; Towse et al., 1998; Towse, Hitch, Hamilton & Pirrie, \n2008; Unsworth & Engle, 2007). Semantic reconstruction can be regarded as \n 29 \none example of cue-mediated recall from secondary memory traces (see also \nHealey & Miyake, 2009; Unsworth & Engle, 2006). \nStimulus similarity in working memory span \nSeveral recent datasets with children and adults indicate that stimulus \nsimilarity or the overlap between processing content and memoranda is relevant \nto working memory (e.g., Conlin et al., 2005; Oberauer et al., 2004; Saito & \nMiyake, 2004). In the present study we compared an extreme or \u201csuper-sized\u201d \nform of stimulus similarity \u2013 where the memoranda are integral to the sentence \nprocessing and not just from the same class of items \u2013 with a less extreme form \nof similarity \u2013 where memoranda are conceptually distinct, whilst still from the \nsame class.  \nSuperior levels of recall in the integrated condition suggest that the \npotentially beneficial contribution of sentences for supporting recall more than \novercomes any detrimental impact from high stimulus similarity. Accordingly, \nstimulus similarity does not represent the whole story so far as recall \nperformance is concerned. Reconstructive processes \u2013 where processing can \nfacilitate identification of the target memory item \u2013 are the more influential task \ndimension here, just as the reverse may be true when memoranda categories \nare manipulated also (Conlin et al., 2005). \nIndeed, rather than viewing stimulus similarity or representation-based \ninterference and recall reconstruction processes as competitive dimensions, we \n 30 \nargue that these accounts are better thought of as potentially complementary to \neach other. Essentially they each emphasize how, in complex span, processing \nand memory activities are not independent of each other. Whilst they differ in \nemphasizing the deleterious or supportive roles of processing, it is apparent that \ntheir predictions are context-dependent, in that the impact of processing activity \nwill depend on the details of its relationship to memory requirements. Moreover, \nthe data echo the views of Oberauer et al. (2004) in suggesting that accounts of \ninterference between processing and memory need to be specific in terms of \nexactly what type of interference is potentially involved. \nConclusion \nIn most studies, working memory tasks are used to derive a single \nperformance index: the amount recalled. This measure is coherent and internally \nreliable, and reliably predictive of many higher cognitive skills. Moreover it is \nclear that many different forms of working memory task, whether reading span or \noperation span (e.g. Hitch et al., 2001), working memory period (Towse et al., \n2005) or combination tasks (Bayliss et al., 2003) all consistently predict these \nexternal measures. There is some core commonality to these different \nprocedures, which the present findings argue is not simply competition between \nprocessing and memory phases of the task. It may instead reflect some higher-\nlevel attribute such as the management or combination of different and unfamiliar \ntask requirements (Jarrold & Bayliss, 2007; see also Towse et al., 2008, for \n 31 \nevidence that task novelty is important) and goal maintenance (Kane & Engle, \n2003).  \nIn the present study, we demonstrate that children\u2019s accuracy is affected by \nthe dynamics of processing. Replicating previous work, we show that children \nwho read more quickly are on average more likely to recall the target sequence \nmore accurately. Reading time, we hasten to add, may be a proxy for some other \ncausal process; but a key finding is that both the rate of forgetting and the \nstrength of the processing speed - recall accuracy relationship depend on how \nthe complex span task is constructed. Importantly, the present data also \ndemonstrate that neither speed of processing during the maintenance phase, nor \naccuracy levels, fully capture the subtleties of working memory. We show that \nrecall timing data can provide an important additional complementary source of \nevidence. This focus on recall allows us to confirm that children are sensitive to \nthe opportunity to boost working memory by drawing on sentence processing \nwhere relevant, and that they do so precisely at the point of sequence recall. \nReferences \n \nBarrouillet, P., Bernadin, S., & Camos, V.
