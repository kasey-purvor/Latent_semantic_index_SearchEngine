The\nconcept of the HLT is discussed and a practical application in the field of advanced\nsecond-language acquisition is described. Based on conceptual analysis and the results of\npreliminary student evaluation, it is argued that the HLT encompasses both in theory and\nin practice the chief qualities of REALs and can form the basis for their creation in a wide\nvariety of disciplines.\nIntroduction\nBringing together theory and practice in the context of university teaching is no mean feat. On\nthe one hand, lecturers are challenged and motivated intellectually by the theoretical arguments\nin the field of education of thinkers such as Grabinger and Dunlap, who have written extensively\nabout comprehensive constructivist learning communities which they term Euch Environments\nfor Active Learning (REALs) (Grabinger and Dunlap, 1995; Grabinger and Dunlap, 1998;\nGrabinger, Dunlap and Duffield, 1997). Yet, on the other hand, they are also challenged and\ndemotivated on a day-to-day basis with the practicalities of teaching increasing numbers of\n4\nAiT-J Volume 7 Number 2\nstudents with a decreasing unit of resource in institutions where competition for funding is\nfierce and where there is pressure from external reviews of research and teaching performance.\nGrabinger and Dunlap (1995) are careful to point out that REALs, in the full sense of the\nacronym, are large-scale holistic communities encompassing all aspects of the teaching and\nlearning experience, and reject 'delivery technologies', 'computer microworlds' and 'computer-\nbased applications' as REALs. The practical task of creating such complete, all-encompassing\nlearning systems can seem daunting, even impossible given the pressures faced by lecturers in\nthe present higher education climate. The present paper will argue that, far from being highly\nlimited and inflexible, as Grabinger and Dunlap suggest, when fully integrated into the teaching\nprogramme, computer-based applications like the Hypermedia Learning Tutorials (HLTs)\ndiscussed below can lie at the heart of flexible learning environments.\nThe paper will begin with a discussion of the concept of the REAL as a theoretical\nconstructivist approach to teaching and learning. After initial consideration of the concept of an\nHLT, theory will be linked to practice in exploring the application of the concept to the area of\nadvanced second-language acquisition with the creation and integration of the HLTs for\nSpanish, Caminos a la expresividad (Pathways to Expressivity). The final part of the paper will\nshow how the HLT, in spite of its essentially computer-based format, encompasses both in\ntheory and in practice many of the qualities set out in the theory of REALs.\nREALs: learning communities founded on constructivist principles\nConstructivism is a term describing a theory of learning which grew from a theory about\nknowledge, developed by Piaget. His work on cognition from the 1920s onwards eschewed the\nidea that knowledge has an independent reality which will one day be attained. Instead he\nemphasized the role of cognitive subjects actively involved in a continual process of building\ntheir own conceptual representations of the world: 'knowledge proceeds neither solely from the\nexperience of objects nor from an innate programming performed in the subject but from\nsuccessive constructions' (Piaget, 1977, p. v).\nThis view of knowledge as constructed by individuals from their experiences led naturally to a\nreconsideration of the way in which people learn and this in turn to the way in which they are\ntaught. Learning is seen as a dynamic process with the emphasis on the learner rather than the\nknowledge to be acquired. Learners will encounter new experiences and ideas from\nidiosyncratic perspectives and will either adapt their personal constructs (sch\u00e9mas) or create\nnew ones within the overall construct which is their knowledge about the world. With the\nrejection of the Lockean view of the mind as a tabula rasa on to which the teacher aims to\ninscribe a fixed body of facts called knowledge, the focus is transferred on to the constructive\nmind and the role of the teacher is to facilitate the process of the creation, adaptation and\nrefinement of sch\u00e9mas (Desforges, 1997). In order to fulfil this facilitative function, teachers\nhave to make use of strategies that present new information and ideas about the world in such a\nway as to enable, encourage and support their students in the process of constructing and\nmodifying their knowledge, a process which will be different according to the experience of\neach individual.\nREALs are comprehensive instructional systems that 'provide learning activities that engage\nthe students in a continuous collaborative process of building and reshaping understanding as a\n5\nSally Ann Kitts and John T. Hancock The creation of REALs in the context of today's universities\nnatural consequence of their experiences and interactions within learning environments that\nauthentically reflect the world around them' (Grabinger and Dunlap, 1995, p. 5). Premised on\nconstructivist principles, they promote an integrative approach to teaching that provides\nstudents with appropriate and varied learning strategies that enable them to take control of and\nresponsibility for their own learning in a fully supportive, contextualized and meaningful\nenvironment.\nThe concept of the Hypermedia Learning Tutorial\nThe term Hypermedia Learning Tutorial is used to describe a synthetic approach to student\nlearning that centres on a highly flexible and adaptable computer application, created using\nAsymetrix Toolbook. The concept of the HLT is applicable to a wide variety of disciplines: the\ncentral computer-based learning application is fully authorable and the constructivist integrative\napproach can be adapted and tailored to subjects as wide-ranging as molecular cell biology or\nadvanced second-language acquisition, two examples currently being developed at the\nUniversity of the West of England, Bristol, and the University of Bristol respectively.\nINTRODUCTION\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nMENU\n[HLT1\nI VOCABULARY] ^\nI GRAMMAR | ^\n1\n| COMPREHENSION |\nTEXTT|\u00cd-ISELF ASSESSMENT)| EXERCISES |\n| VOCABULARY | FUTURE STUDENT INPUT |\nI| COMPOSITION]\n4ASSESSED\nSTUDENT\nOUTPUT\nESSAYS\nTAPES\nTEXTS\nHLT 11\nI\nFigure I: A schematic representation of a serial\napproach to learning with the HLTs.\n6\nAu-] Volume 7 Number 2\nINTRODUCTION\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nMENU\nIl t 4' irt\n1 CHOICE OF TUTORIALS | ^\n\u00a1CONTENTS I-4I *\u00ab\u2022\nI CHOICE OF TEXTS I\nt\nUNDERSTANDING AIDS\nWITHIN TEXTS\nGRAMMAR\nVOCABULARY\nCOMPREHENSION\nSELF ASSESSMENT\nEXERCISES\ni i\nUTURE STUDENT INPUT!\n| coMPosrriONl \u2022>\n1 GRAMMAR I\ni\nASSESSED\nSTUDENT\nOUTPUT\nESSAYS\nTAPES\nTEXTS\nFigure 2: A schematic representation of a holistic approach to learning with the HLTs.\nCaminos a la expresividad N\u00b0 2: Contents\nTexts Exercises\n1.

Using HLTs students focus on and explore the\nresources and support they need as individuals. They access the material in a form that suits their\nown particular learning preferences, an important aspect to consider if an application is to be\nsuccessful (Jones, Jacobs and Brown, 1997). The tutorials are constructed so as to offer both a\nguided 'serial* approach (Figure 1) and an open, exploratory or 'holistic' approach (Figure 2), or a\nmixture of the two. The terms 'serial' and 'holistic' were first used in this context by Pask (1976).\nThe tutorials are made available on a 24-hour open-access basis and in that sense students can\nmake as much or as little use of them as they wish, whenever, they wish. However, the tutorials\nare also fully integrated into the structure of existing teaching programmes using a variety of\nlinks which serve both to encourage students to use them and to extend the learning potential of\nboth the HLTs themselves and the current teaching programme. This approach is consistent with\nthe acknowledgement that student motivation and a successful integration strategy are key\nelements of a successful implementation programme (Stoner, 1997; Harvey and Mogey, 1997).\nHLTs are thematic and centre on a wide selection of meaningful material including\nstraightforward written texts, audio\/video recordings, animations, pictures and diagrams\n(hereafter referred to simply as texts). Progress through the different texts can be linear, using\nthe basic forward and backwards navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen, or exploratory\nvia a clickable contents map or overview (Figure 3).\n8\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 2\nKey elements of the texts are hyperlinked to provide instant clarifications or examples should\nthe student wish to click on them. In the case of audio\/video recordings this is effected via\naccompanying transcriptions. Each text is linked via a screen button to an interactive\ncomprehension exercise which enables students to assess their understanding of the key\nconcepts contained within it, with instant feedback and a score provided (Figure 4).\nThe thematic nature of the HLTs means that each tutorial as a whole provides information and\nideas which can then be drawn upon and exploited by the student in a variety of assessment\nactivities. Assessment takes various forms. A series of hyperlinked interactive computer-based\nactivities gives opportunities for self-assessment with general feedback. Peer and lecturer\nassessment strategies are employed in a non-computer setting through links to other learning\nactivities such as lectures, seminars, practic\u00e1is, workshops and discussion groups, and provide\nindividual feedback. Amongst the assessment strategies used are several that involve the\nstudents with the continued expansion and development of the HLTs, for example a student\ncould be required to locate an appropriate text either on a related subject or in an entirely new\narea which they would then analyse in order to provide a series of explanations for what they\nconsidered to be key elements of the text as well as devising a comprehension exercise with\nright and wrong answers. The inclusion of student-created material is an important strategy in\nmotivating students, updating the material and making it relevant to students' needs (Landow,\n1994; Harvey and Mogey, 1997).\nA practical application of HLTs in advanced second-language\nacquisition\nAt the University of Bristol, four HLTs entitled Caminos a la expresividad have been developed\nas part of the final-year language programme from September 1999 for single and joint honours\nstudents of Spanish. They are written in Asymetrix Toolbook using the CALScribe template as a\nstarting-point (Kitts and Whittlestone, 1998). Caminos a la expresividad centres on written\ntexts and audio\/video recordings on a variety of themes of contemporary relevance to students\nof Hispanic and Latin American culture. The basic aim of the tutorials is twofold. Firstly, they\nprovide information and ideas on contemporary topics of relevance and importance to students\nwhich they can use as starting-points for discussion as they develop and refine their own ideas.\nTo support this aim Caminos a la expresividad has lists of references for further reading, some\nof which are available directly from the tutorial via hyperlinks, and connections to an HLT\nwebsite which provides additional ideas and links to relevant material. Secondly, the tutorials\ngive practical assistance with language work in terms of clarifications and explanations of\ncomplex or unusual aspects of syntax and lexis and through interactive self-assessment\nexercises on grammar, vocabulary, comprehension and composition.\nCaminos a la expresividad is being integrated fully into the final-year language curriculum\nthrough links with oral presentations and written projects. Students explore each tutorial on an\nopen-access basis over a six-week period during which they also attend oral discussion classes\nand listen to, present and critique presentations by their peers. These presentations are based on\ntutorial topics and use texts and supplementary material to generate ideas. Some of the oral\npresentations will be assessed by the lecturer in addition to the written project required in each\ntwelve-week teaching block. The students work on their own, in pairs or in small groups.\nProject work includes additional edited texts for inclusion in Caminos a la expresividad,\n9\nSally Ann Kitts and John T. Hancock The creation of REALs \u00a1n the context of today's universities\nassessed oral presentations, for example representing contrasting arguments on a topic, or\nwritten essays expressing students' own views but informed by the different opinions and ideas\ncontained in the various texts. The best student projects will subsequently be incorporated into\nexisting tutorials or used as the basis for new ones.\nEvaluation is an essential part of the development and introduction of any new pedagogic\nmethod (Laurillard, 1993; Draper, Brown, Edgerton, Henderson, McAteer, Smith and Watt,\n1994; Draper, 1997) and formative evaluation has been carried out at various points in the\ndevelopment of Caminos a la expresividad, from pre-program design through to target group\nassessment of two of the four final versions. The pilot tutorial, entitled 'La Espa\u00f1a de las\nAutonom\u00edas', was evaluated through observation and a user questionnaire in January\/February\n1998. Response to this student evaluation led to greater diversity of themes and highlighted a\nnumber of technical problems with the software which have since been resolved.\nBy far the most positive aspect was the overwhelming student support for the concept of the\nHLTs for Spanish as a new student-centred yet fully-integrated and responsive approach to\nfinal-year language teaching. Ninety-three per cent of respondents to the questionnaire enjoyed\nthe pilot HLT and considered the Caminos a la expresividad series as a whole to be a valuable\ninnovation to the language curriculum. A minimum of 71 per cent in each case approved of the\nlanguage content, variety of exercises, planned integration and overall design of the\ncourseware. Further user evaluation of another two of the final four Spanish HLTs was carried\nout in March 1999 with the current final year whose successors will be the first full users. Forty-\nfive students tried out the tutorials and discussed the integration plans. As far as language skills\nare concerned, 95 per cent agreed that the embedded metalinguistic points and exercises would\nhelp to improve their knowledge, understanding and ability to use the Spanish language, while\n98 per cent of those questioned favoured the integration plans, agreeing that Caminos a la\nexpresividad offers effective and valuable additional support to the process of oral and written\nexpression in Spanish.\nOther evaluation results are discussed below. Further evaluation will be carried out following\nthe full integration of the tutorials into the degree programme from September 1999.\nAre HLTs really REALs?\nGrabinger and Dunlap (1995, p. 5) give five key aspects of the holistic constructivist approach\nto learning which characterize REALs. They maintain that REALs:\n\u2022 promote study and investigation within authentic contexts;\n\u2022 encourage the growth of student responsibility, initiative, decision-making, and intentional\nlearning;\n\u2022 cultivate collaboration among students and teachers;\n\u2022 utilize dynamic, interdisciplinary, generative learning activities that promote higher-order\nthinking processes to help students develop rich and complex knowledge structures;\n\u2022 assess student progress in content and learning-to-learn within authentic contexts using\nrealistic tasks and performances.\n10\nALT-} Volume 7 Number 2\nIf HLTs are to be considered as REALs they should embrace these characteristics. An\nexamination of the HLTs both in conceptual terms and in their application to second-language\nacquisition show that to a large extent they do indeed have these characteristics.\nStudy within authentic contexts\nHLTs make use of authentic materials grouped together under key themes. They are rich in\ninformation that is presented in relevant, meaningful contexts by virtue both of this thematic\nstructure and through their integration into a wider teaching programme. In terms of the\nCaminos a la expresividad series, this is achieved by providing texts in Spanish from authentic\npeninsular and Latin American sources on real-life topics of immediate relevance to today's\nstudents. They also support students in the study of the structure of the language itself in a\nrooted, contextual and authentic fashion.\nIn the March 1999 evaluation, 90 per cent of the students found the topics covered by HLTs 2\nand 3 to be relevant and meaningful. While only 58 per cent agreed that a contextual approach\nwas likely to be more effective for them than other more conventional strategies such as\nworking through a grammar book or attending grammar classes, a large number (38 per cent)\nwere unsure. Classroom observation and informal feedback suggests that this uncertainty was\nsimply because the students felt unable to give a definite response until they had tried out the\nnew approach over several weeks. Only 4 per cent felt that the new approach was unlikely to be\nmore effective.\nStudent responsibility and intentional learning\nIntegration through assessment and the involvement of students in the continued growth and\ndevelopment of the HLTs motivates students, thereby promoting and encouraging study and an\nincrease in student responsibility, initiative and decision-making. Students are also encouraged\nto take responsibility for their learning by the presentation of the HLTs on an open-access basis,\ngiving the students control about how much they use them. By focusing the students' minds on\nthe final goal of the production of an item for assessment and presenting them with varied\nstrategies within the HLT to achieve that final goal, the tutorials encourage intentional learning,\nas described by Palincsar and Klenk (1992) as 'an achievement resulting from the learner's\npurposeful, effortful, self-regulated, and active engagement' (p. 212). In relation to Caminos a\nla expresividad, this applies both to the thematic work and the linguistic revision. The open\npresentation of the material allowing both serial and holistic approaches allows the HLTs to\nrespond to students' endogenous learning styles and to their existing framework of knowledge.\nSixty-two per cent of students in the March evaluation agreed that having the opportunity to\ncontribute to existing or new HLTs would encourage them to use the tutorials. Again there were\nvery few negative responses (7 per cent) with the remaining 31 per cent expressing uncertainty\nuntil they had experienced the HLTs more fully. The HLT website was seen as a very positive\nand useful tool for the production of assignments by 97 per cent of students who considered that\nit would help them to develop and refine their ideas on the subjects discussed.\nCollaboration among students and teachers\nThe collaborative process of involving students in the continued expansion and development of\nthe HLTs is a motivating factor and a key to encouraging students to take responsibility for their\nlearning. It gives students a share in the ownership of the learning resource and is also\nencouraged via additional learning activities linked to the HLTs such as non-assessed oral\npresentations and discussion workshops to consider ideas raised by the texts and their\nII\nSolly Ann Kitts and John T. Hancock The creation of REALs in the context of today's universities\nhyperlinked computer-based activities. Students have increased possibilities for collaborative\nwork both with their peers and with their lecturers and just over 80 per cent of the students\nquestioned in the March 1999 evaluation liked this idea.\nDynamic, interdisciplinary and generative learning activities\nBoth the hyperlinked and the non-computer-based activities involve students in generative\nlearning in that, working with the ideas and concepts presented through the HLT texts, the\ndifferent activities require that they 'engage in argumentation and reflection as they try to use\nand then refine their existing knowledge as they attempt to make sense of alternate points of\nview' (Grabinger and Dunlap, 1995, p. 19). The assessed work in particular involves them in\nrelevant investigative projects which require them to develop and extend their knowledge\nstructures, using higher-order critical and analytical skills. In Caminos a la expresividad the fact\nthat the assessed work is in Spanish necessitates a high-level ability to use the language and this\nis supported by the metalinguistic aspects of the tutorials; for example, the explanations of\nitems of syntax and lexis within the texts enable the students to observe the language in action\nand this in turn calls for the use of higher-order skills of analysis and synthesis to abstract the\nmeaning behind the usage and incorporate the new structures into their own knowledge\nhierarchy.\nWhile 76 per cent of students found this a more attractive approach to the learning of language\nthan other strategies they had experienced, only the results of the first series of assessments\ncompared to those of previous years will be able to provide a clear indication as to whether this\napproach is more successful at developing and extending the students' higher-order critical and\nanalytical skills compared with previous methods employed.\nAssessment in authentic contexts\nStudents are assessed via a variety of different tasks and projects, both formative and\nsummative, at different levels, involving self, peer, and lecturer assessment and with feedback\nalways provided. It is not envisaged that the Spanish HLTs will be static creations, rather the\nindividual tutorials will be extended and new ones created with the involvement of students in\nall aspects and in particular utilizing material prepared by the students in the various forms of\nassessment, thereby rendering that assessment more meaningful and authentic.\nIn the March evaluation, 63 per cent of students felt that contributing directly to existing or new\nHLTs would give added meaning to their work and help them to feel fully involved in and\nresponsible for their own learning. Again there were very few negative responses (7 per cent)\nwith the remaining 30 per cent again expressing uncertainty until they had experienced the\nHLTs more fully.\nConclusion\nThe HLTs, both conceptually and in their application to advanced second-language acquisition,\nencompass the chief qualities set out in the theory of REALs, a view that is confirmed to a large\nextent by the evaluation carried out with final-year students in March 1999. Students are\nencouraged to take responsibility for their learning through generative learning activities in\nauthentic and realistic contexts and assessed on their learning in varied ways that encourage and\ndemonstrate higher-order thinking and a collaborative approach, in terms of both student\/\nstudent and student\/lecturer interactions.\n12\nALT-) Volume 7 Number 2\nThe concept of the HLT is not limited to a language application but rather can be applied across\nthe disciplines: the computer-based application it revolves around is easily authored and texts\ncan be written, audio\/video, pictorial or diagrammatic. Work at the University of the West of\nEngland, Bristol, on an HLT for molecular cell biology and a literary application being\ndeveloped at the University of Bristol will demonstrate the interdisciplinary nature of the\napproach as both the programs and the integration strategies are developed and evaluated. The\ncomprehensive integration into the degree programme of the computer application at the heart\nof the REAL, through a variety of complementary learning and assessment strategies, is clearly\na vital factor, for without it the result would certainly be no more than useful but limited\ncomputer applications. Planned further analysis of practical applications of HLTs and detailed\nevaluation of the first cohort of students to graduate after the full integration of Caminos a la\nexpresividad into the degree programme will illuminate the extent to which REALs have an\neffect on the final learning outcomes, both in terms of students' perceptions of their learning\nand their actual degree result.\nAcknowledgements\nThe HLTs for Spanish, Caminos a la expresividad, have been supported in their development by\nthree grants from the University of Bristol Teaching and Learning Group.
