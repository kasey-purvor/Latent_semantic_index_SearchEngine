Introduction \n The prediction of the Modigliani and Miller model that in a perfect capital market the \nvalue of the firm is independent of its capital structure, and hence debt and equity are perfect \nsubstitutes for each other, is widely accepted.  However, once the assumption of perfect \ncapital markets is relaxed, the choice of capital structure becomes an important value-\ndetermining factor.  This paved the way for the development of alternative theories of capital \nstructure decision and their empirical analysis.  Although it is now recognized that the choice \nbetween debt and equity depends on firm-specific characteristics, the empirical evidence is \nmixed and often difficult to interpret.  Moreover, still very little is understood about the \ndeterminants of the firm\u2019s financing mix outside the US and other major developed markets, \nwith only a few papers analysing international data (Rajan and Zingales, 1995; Booth et al., \n2001; and Antoniou et al., 2002).  Certainly, there is not enough evidence on how theories \nformulated for firms operating in major developed markets can be applied to firms outside \nthese markets, and in countries with different institutional and legal environments.  For \nexample, given the economic importance of the Asia Pacific region and the diversity of \ncountries in this region, it is surprising that so little research has been so far conducted1. \n In addition, very little is known about the possible effects of the East Asian financial \ncrisis of 1997 on corporate decision-making.  The 1997 crisis, which originated in Thailand, \naffected the region\u2019s capital markets severely, with outflows of foreign investments as \ninternational investors became concerned with the higher risk in the affected countries.  \nRaising capital in these countries became more costly because of higher risk premia, \ncompounded by the higher level of interest rates needed to support local currencies.  Hence, a \ncomparative analysis of the determinants of capital structure both across countries and \n                                                 \n1\n Published studies include Wiwattanakantang (1999) for Thailand; Suto (2003) for Malaysia; Prasad et al. \n(2003) for Thailand and Malaysia; Cassar and Holmes (2003) and Zoppa and McMahon (2002) for Australia. \n 3 \n \nbetween the pre- and post-crisis periods should provide valuable insights into firm\u2019s financial \ndecision making. \n The paper contributes to the literature by examining the determinants of corporate \ncapital structure in four countries in the Asia Pacific region, namely Thailand, Malaysia, \nSingapore and Australia.  The choice of countries is motivated by several factors. Firstly, \nthey are all in the Asia Pacific region where the literature on the determinants of capital \nstructure is sparse.  Secondly, they have different institutional set-ups, such as financial \nmarkets, legal traditions, bankruptcy codes and corporate ownership structure.  In particular, \nMalaysia, Singapore and Australia are members of the British Commonwealth and thus have \nsome common attributes in accounting practices, corporate governance and corporate control.  \nIn addition, Thailand and Malaysia are emerging markets, while Singapore and Australia are \nmore established markets.  This diversity offers the opportunity to assess the effects of \ndifferent environments on corporate financial decisions. Thirdly, they were hit in different \ndegrees by the 1997 East Asian financial crisis: the crisis hit Thailand and Malaysia most \nseverely; Singapore was also affected but its economy recovered more quickly, while \nAustralia escaped it altogether (Grenville, 1999; and Cha and Oh, 2000). \n The paper is organised as follows.  The second section reviews the corporate \ngovernance and institutional environments in the sample countries and discusses their \npossible implications on the choice of financing mix of firms operating in these countries.  \nSection three presents the methodology, discusses the potential determinants of capital \nstructure and develops testable propositions.  Data and findings are discussed in section four, \nwhile section five offers concluding remarks. \n \n 4 \n \n2. Corporate Governance and Institutional Environment in the Asia Pacific Region \n The legal, regulatory and institutional environments of a country affect the relationships \nbetween the firm\u2019s stakeholders, and thus the process of corporate governance (La Porta et \nal., 1998; and Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic, 1996 and 2002).  Table 1 summarises major \naspects of corporate governance, institutional and legal environment in the Asia Pacific \nregion in comparison to the US and the UK, as assessed by existing literature.  Like the US \nand the UK, all the countries under investigation are categorised as market-based economies; \nhowever, the ownership of firms in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore is primarily family-\nbased. With respect to financing patterns, Beck et al. (2002) show that firms in more \ndeveloped countries have better access to external finance.  Hence Thai and Malaysian firms \nare expected to rely more on internal resources (equity) than Australia and Singaporean firms.  \nCommon law is the foundation of the British Commonwealth\u2019s members, including \nMalaysia, Singapore and Australia.  Although Thailand\u2019s law originated from common law, it \nhas been influenced by French civil law.  Among our sample countries, Australia ranks the \nhighest on all three definitions of the \u2018rule of law\u2019, followed by Singapore, Malaysia and \nThailand. Since the rule of law in Thailand is relatively weak, the level of expropriation of \nminority stakeholders is likely to be the highest implying more agency problems. \n \n[INSERT TABLE 1] \n \n When the law protects outside investors, they become more willing to finance firms.  \nThus, firms in countries with weaker investor rights may be forced to use more internally \ngenerated funds, as external capital is likely to be expensive and\/or rationed.  Table 1 shows \nthat Singapore and Malaysia have higher standards of legal protection than Australia and \nThailand. Furthermore, the law provides equal protection to creditors and shareholders in \n 5 \n \nMalaysia and Singapore and hence the debt-equity ratios in these countries are likely to \nremain independent of these provisions. On the other hand, shareholders appear to be better \nprotected in Australia, while creditors have relatively better protection in Thailand.  \nTherefore, Australian firms are expected to have relatively higher levels of equity in their \ncapital structure, while Thai firms are likely to have higher debt.   \n The ownership structure of a firm can also affect its financial structure as it has \nimplications for agency relationships within the firm.  Evidence shows that firms in East \nAsian countries are usually owned by a small number of families (Wiwattanakantang, 1999; \nand Claessens and Fan, 2002).  Such closely held ownership can lead to better performance, \nas the pooling of resources and information decreases transaction costs.  However, \nconcentration of ownership and management in few hands can also lead to high expropriation \nof minority stakeholders.  Thus, on these bases, the level of external borrowing of firms in \nEast Asian countries is expected to be lower than that of firms in western developed \neconomies.  In particular, Claessens et al. (2002) show that Thailand has the highest \nownership of publicly traded companies by families and financial institutions among the \ncountries in the sample.  This could explain the lowest frequency of bankruptcies in Thailand.  \nIn addition, since Thai and Malaysian firms have their primary banks as their shareholders, \nthey should have easier access to bank loan and less need for collateral. Hence, the effect of \ntangible assets on firms\u2019 leverage is expected to be weaker in these two countries, and more \nso in Malaysia where banks are over-protected and capital markets more stringently regulated \n(Suto, 2003).  This is expected to: (i) bring about a reduction in the agency cost of debt and \nthus lead to higher levels of debt; (ii) weaken the effect of tangibility on leverage as the firms \nshould be able to borrow without, or with lower, collaterals; and (c) lessen the effect of firm\u2019s \nsize on leverage, as bankruptcy risk should be lower.  On the other hand, collateral should be \n 6 \n \na major factor for Australian firms, as they operate in an environment where creditors\u2019 \nprotection is very low and the firms\u2019 relation with their lenders is at arm\u2019s length.   \n Finally, Table 1 shows differences in the involvement of government in business across \nour sample countries.  Large firms in Singapore are heavily controlled by the government \n(Mak and Li, 2001).  Government-linked corporations have several advantages, such as better \nprotection from the market for corporate control, easier access to alternative sources of \nfinancing, and guaranteed (implicit) solvency.  This suggests a less important role for asset \ntangibility, liquidity, earnings volatility and firm size in the capital structure choice of \nSingaporean firms.  In summary, the above discussion reveals that differences in the \ninstitutional traditions, legal framework and corporate governance practices within the \nsample countries may have implications on the capital structure choice. \n  \n3. Methodology, Hypotheses Development and Variable Identification \n3.1 Firm-Specific Determinants of Capital Structure by Country \nTo assess the determinants of capital structure in the four sample countries, individual \nfirm\u2019s leverage ratios are modelled as a function of several firm-specific factors in a cross-\nsectional framework.  Specifically, the following relationship is estimated using OLS for each \ncountry: \n   \u2211\n=\n\u2212\n++=\nN\nk\ntiatikkti FFY\n1\n,,,0, \u03b5\u03b3\u03b1  (1)2 \nwhere, Yi,t is firm\u2019s i leverage at time t, measured at the accounting year-end; FFk,i,t-a is a \nvector of k firm i\u2019s specific factors, averaged over the previous a years to reflect the medium \nto long term nature of the capital structure decision (Rajan and Zingales, 1995; and Pandey, \n                                                 \n2\n The empirical version of Equation 1 controls for industry effects; however, no statistically significant effect \nwas found. \n 7 \n \n2001). For the full sample period, the dependent variable is the leverage of 2001 and the \nexplanatory variables are the averages of 1993-2000.  This averaging process also reduces the \npossibility of measurement error and the effects of random fluctuations in the variables.  In \naddition, the averages of the explanatory variables are lagged one period in order to isolate \nthe analysis from the potential reverse causality between independent and dependent \nvariables and to provide a more robust test of the theory.  The vector of firm-specific \nvariables incorporates the following factors: tangibility, profitability, firm size, growth \nopportunities, non-debt tax shield, liquidity, earnings volatility, and share price performance.  \nThe choice of factors and the hypothesis formulation are motivated by both theoretical and \nempirical considerations3.  Table 2 summarizes the relationships postulated by the theory \nbetween each explanatory variable and leverage, and their empirical verification. \n \n[INSERT TABLE 2] \n \n The leverage ratio, the dependent variable, is measured as4: \n)( sharespreferenceofvalueBookequityofvalueMarketdebtTotal\ndebtTotal\nRatioCapitaltoDebt\n++\n=\n \n                                                 \n3\n See Harris and Raviv (1991) for an extensive review of the theoretical literature on the determinants of capital \nstructure. \n4\n As Harris and Raviv (1991) argue, the choice of measures for both leverage and the explanatory variables is \ncrucial, as it may affect the interpretation of the results. Rajan and Zingales (1995) also show that the \ndeterminants of capital structure are sensitive to the measure of leverage. Thus, different measures of leverage \nand of some of the independent variables were used to assess the robustness of the results presented in the paper. \nThe measure of leverage based on the market value of equity, rather than the book value, was finally chosen as \nit gave more theoretically consistent results, in line with Wiwattanakantang (1999) and Suto (2003), among \nothers.   \n 8 \n \n Tangibility is defined as the ratio of total fixed assets to total assets.  Agency theory \nsuggests that firms with high leverage tend to underinvest, or invest suboptimally, and thus \ntransfer wealth away from debtholders to equityholders.  These cause lenders to require \ncollateral because the use of secured debts can help alleviate this problem. Moreover, the \nliquidation value of the firm increases with the tangibility of assets and decreases the \nprobability of mispricing in the event of bankruptcy.  Firms unable to provide collaterals will \nhave to pay higher interest, or will be forced to issue equity instead of debt (Scott, 1977).  \nThus, a positive relationship between tangibility of assets and leverage is anticipated.  \n Profitability is defined as the ratio of earnings before interest, tax and depreciation to \ntotal assets.  The pecking-order theory postulates that managers prefer to finance projects \ninternally because of the informational asymmetry between managers and outside investors.  \nIn addition, profitable firms prefer not to raise external equity in order to avoid potential \ndilution of ownership.  Thus, we expect an inverse relation between profitability and \nleverage.  Firm size is measured by the natural log of assets.  The trade-off theory postulates \na positive relation between firm size and debt, since larger firms have been shown to have \nlower bankruptcy risk and relatively lower bankruptcy cost.  In addition, large firms have \nlower agency costs of debt, relatively smaller monitoring costs, less volatile cash flows, \neasier access to credit market, and require more debt to fully benefit from the tax shield.  \nTherefore, firm size is expected to have a positive impact on leverage.  \n Growth opportunity is defined as the book value of total assets less the book value of \nequity plus the market value of equity divided by the book value of total assets.  Higher \ngrowth opportunities provide incentives to invest suboptimally, or to accept risky projects \nthat expropriate wealth from debtholders.  This raises the cost of borrowing and thus growth \nfirms tend to use internal resources or equity capital rather than debt.  In addition, high \ngrowth firms whose value comes from intangible growth opportunities do not want to commit \n 9 \n \nthemselves to debt servicing as their revenue may not be available when needed.  Therefore, \nan inverse relationship between growth opportunity and leverage is postulated. \n In the absence of more accurate measures, the non-debt tax shield is defined as the ratio \nof depreciation to total assets.  As predicted by the trade-off theory, a major motivation for \nusing debt instead of equity is to save corporate tax.  However, firms can use non-debt tax \nshields such as depreciation to reduce corporate tax.  Thus, a higher non-debt tax shield \nreduces the potential tax benefit of debt and hence it should be inversely related to leverage.  \nLiquidity is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities.  As predicted by the \npecking order theory, firms with high liquidity will borrow less.  In addition, managers can \nmanipulate liquid assets in favour of shareholders against the interest of debt holders, \nincreasing the agency costs of debt.  Thus a negative relationship between liquidity and \nleverage is expected.  The volatility of earnings is defined as the absolute difference between \nthe annual percentage change in earnings before interest and taxes and the average of this \nchange over the sample period.  Higher volatility of earnings increases the probability of \nfinancial distress, since firms may not be able to fulfil their debt servicing commitments.  \nThus firm\u2019s debt capacity decreases with increases in earnings volatility leading to an \nexpected inverse relation with leverage.  Share price performance is defined as the first \ndifference of the logs of annual share prices, matched to the month of firms\u2019 fiscal year-end.  \nThe history of share prices has been shown to have an impact on the firm\u2019s capital structure.  \nDue to the information asymmetry between managers and outside investors, new shares are \nissued at a discount.  If equity is issued when shares are overvalued, the real cost of the \ndiscount to the existing shareholders can be smaller, or none.  Therefore, firms prefer equity \nto debt when share prices increase.  As predicted by the market timing theory (Baker and \nWurgler, 2002), share price performance and leverage should be inversely related.  \n 10 \n \n As stated earlier, one of the objectives of the paper is to examine the possible effects of \nthe Asian financial crisis of 1997 on the capital structure decision process.  To achieve this, \nEquation (1) is further estimated over two sub-samples: (i) a pre-crisis period, where the \ndependent variable is the leverage ratio in 1996 and the explanatory variables are the \naverages over 1993-1995; and (ii) a post-crisis period, where the dependent variable is the \nleverage ratio in 2001 and the explanatory variables are the averages over 1998-2000.  Since \nthe crisis started in June-July of 1997, the data for this year are excluded in the sub-sample \nanalysis. Wald statistics are estimated to examine whether there has been any significant \nchange in the role of the explanatory variables due to the financial crisis of 1997. \n \n3.2 The Effects of Country-Specific Variables on the Capital Structure Decision \n In the light of the differences in the countries\u2019 institutional and legal environments as \ndescribed in section 2, equation (1) is re-estimated using fixed effect panel and pooled OLS \nprocedures. The data of the four sample countries are pooled to create one panel data sample, \nand the firm-specific factors are augmented with seven additional country specific variables, \nnamely the degree of stock market\u2019s activity, the level of interest rates, the legal protection of \ncreditor\u2019s rights, ownership concentration, and three country dummies.  Three regressions are \nestimated separately to avoid potential multicollinearity problems due to the high correlation \nbetween country dummies, creditor\u2019s rights and ownership concentration. The first regression \nincludes country dummies which are replaced by creditor\u2019s rights and ownership \nconcentration in turn in the second and third regressions. \n Stock market\u2019s activity is measured by the ratio of traded value to market capitalisation, \nmatched to the month of firms\u2019 fiscal year-end.  According to Demirguc-Kunt and \nMaksimovic (1996), financial market development plays an important role in the firms\u2019 \nfinancing choice.  As stock market activity increases, firms\u2019 preference for equity over debt \n 11 \n \nalso increases.  Therefore, stock market\u2019s activity is expected to be inversely related to debt.  \nThe level of interest rates is proxied by the lending rate5, matched to the month of firms\u2019 \nfiscal year-end.  In the presence of frictions such as taxation and bankruptcy costs, changes in \ninterest rates can affect capital structure, as firms are more likely to use debt when the cost of \nborrowing is low.  Under this hypothesis the level of interest rates is expected to be \nnegatively related to leverage.  However, interest rates also incorporate inflation expectations \nand thus firms could be expected to shift from equity to debt financing when interest rates are \nincreasing.  In this case, the level of interest rates is expected to be positively related to \nleverage.  Three country dummy variables are also included in the model, equal to 1 for \nThailand (THDUM), Malaysia (MLDUM) and Singapore (SPDUM) respectively, and 0 \notherwise.  These dummies are intended to capture differences in leverage between the \nsample countries not detected by other variables.  As a proxy for creditors\u2019 rights, the score \nby La Porta et al. (1998) shown in Table 1 is used.  Better creditor\u2019s rights encourage the \ndevelopment of loan capital markets and are likely to decrease the cost of loan capital as \ncreditor\u2019s risk is decreased by better legal protection.  This leads to the prediction of a \npositive relationship between creditor\u2019s rights and leverage.  The ownership by the three \nlargest shareholders of the ten largest non-financial domestic firms presented by La Porta et \nal. (1998) and shown in Table 1 is used as a proxy for ownership concentration.  Both agency \nand signalling theories predict that higher concentration induces higher levels of monitoring, \nimplying a reduction in management discretion and asset substitution respectively.  This \nleads to a diminished role of debt in mitigating moral hazard and to debt loosing reliability as \na managerial signal.  Thus a negative relationship between ownership concentration and \nleverage is expected. \n                                                 \n5\n The lending rate used in this paper is the maximum rate charged by commercial banks as recorded by the IMF \nInternational Financial Statistics and reported by Datastream.   \n 12 \n \n4. Data and Empirical Results \n4.1 Data \n As discussed above, the selection of sample countries, namely Thailand, Malaysia, \nSingapore and Australia, is guided by the objectives of: (i) analysing the determinants of \ncapital structure of the firms operating in Asian Pacific countries with different legal, \nfinancial and corporate governance systems; and (ii) investigating the potential influence of \nthe 1997 financial crisis on the capital structure decision process.  The annual data are \nobtained from Datastream to cover the period 1993-2001.  The sample includes all non-\nfinancial firms listed in the relevant national stock exchanges for which a continuous data set \nexists over the sample period.  Hence the sample consists of 294 Thai, 669 Malaysian, 345 \nSingaporean, and 219 Australian firms. \n Summary statistics of the major variables over the sample period are presented in Table \n3, while Figure 1 depicts the annual average leverage ratio of sample countries.  Both set of \nfigures reveal that Thai firms were consistently more heavily levered, while Australian firms \nhad the lowest leverage ratio6.  Moreover, the increase in the leverage ratio over the period \nwas highest in Malaysia, followed by Thailand, while leverage remained almost constant in \nAustralia.  This is consistent with the highest legal protection of shareholders in Australia and \nthe highest creditor\u2019s protection in Thailand and Malaysia, shown in Table 1 and discussed in \nSection 2 above.  It is also noteworthy that the average leverage ratios in Thailand and \nMalaysia increased substantially after the 1997 financial crisis, motivating further an \ninvestigation into the possible implications of the crisis on corporate financing decisions7. \n                                                 \n6\n A t-test of equality in means shows that the annual leverage ratio of firms in Thailand differs significantly from \nall other countries\u2019 leverage; the average leverage ratios of firms in Singapore and Australia are also \nsignificantly different. \n7\n It must be however noted that the increase in debt ratios after the crisis is partly due to the fact that firms \nsuffered losses and their market capitalization fell. \n 13 \n \n[INSERT TABLE 3] \n[INSERT FIGURE 1] \n \n4.2 Empirical Results \nThe cross-sectional results from estimating equation (1) for each individual country are \nreported in Table 4.  For each country, the first column presents the results over the whole \nsample period, while columns two and three present the results pertaining to the period before \nand after the 1997 crisis, respectively.  The findings over the whole period are discussed first \nand an analysis of pre- and post-crisis differences follows. \n \n4.2.1 Cross-sectional results for individual countries and firm-specific effects over the whole \nsample period \nThe relationship between leverage and tangibility (TANG), while positive as expected, \nis not statistically significant in any country with the exception of Australia.  This result is \nconsistent with Witwattanakantang (1999) for Thai firms.  It is however in contrast with the \nfindings of Prasad et al. (2003) and Suto (2003) who find a positively significant relationship \nfor Malaysian firms, and Booth et al. (2001) who find a negative relationship for Thai firms.  \nAs discussed in Section 2, the insignificant effect of tangibility can be explained by the tight \nfamily held and concentrated ownership and the close relationship of firms with their lenders, \nand thus the lesser need for collateral in order to borrow.  In addition, especially for \nSingaporean firms, this could also be due to the relatively high level of government \nownership.  In contrast to Cassar and Holmes (2003), tangibility is found to have a positive \nimpact on the leverage of Australian firms, which have dispersed ownership and arm\u2019s length \nrelationship with their lenders, and hence collaterals play an important role in raising debt \n 14 \n \ncapital.  Moreover, Australia has the lowest level of legal protection for creditors and thus it \nis natural for Australian lenders to look for added security. \n \n[INSERT TABLE 4] \n \n The relationship between profitability (PROF) and leverage is found to be negative as \npostulated, but statistically insignificant for all countries with the exception of Malaysia.  \nThis is in contrast with most previous studies analysing only a limited set of variables (Rajan \nand Zingales, 1995; Booth et al., 2001; Zoppa and McMahon, 2002; and Cassar and Holmes, \n2003) and reporting a significant effect of profitability on leverage.  In comparison to these \nstudies, this paper includes additional firm specific variables overcoming a possible omitted \nvariables problem in the previous literature8.  The negative and significant result for Malaysia \nis consistent with the predictions of the pecking order theory, showing that firms prefer to use \ninternal sources of funding when profits are high. \n Firm size (SIZE) has a positively significant impact on leverage in all countries, with \nthe exception of Singapore, where firms receive government support and thus face less risk of \nfinancial distress whatever their size.  This finding is consistent to Wiwattanakantang (1999), \nBooth et al. (2001), Pandey (2001) and Prasad et al. (2003), and with the trade-off and agency \ntheories, confirming that larger firms tend to have better borrowing capacity relative to \nsmaller firms.  As expected, the impact of growth opportunity (GROW) on leverage is \nnegative for all countries, with the exception of Australia, but it is significant only for \nThailand and Singapore.  This gives support to the predictions of the agency theory that high \n                                                 \n8\n To evaluate this, a restricted version of equation (1) with only the four variables in Rajan and Zingales (1995) \nwas estimated. The results confirm a significant inverse effect of profitability on leverage in all countries and \nhence that the findings presented in this paper are not data specific. \n 15 \n \ngrowth firms use less debt since they do not wish to expose themselves to possible \nrestrictions imposed by lenders.  It is also consistent with most previous studies on the region \n(e.g., Zoppa and McMahon, 2002), except Booth et al. (2001) who found a positive \nrelationship for Thai and Malaysian firms. \n The estimated coefficient of non-debt tax shield (NDTS) has the predicted negative \nsign and is statistically significant for all countries supporting tax-based models of capital \nstructure.  It also confirms the findings of previous studies such as Wiwattanakantang (1999).  \nSimilarly, liquidity (LIQ) and share price performance (SPP) have a negative and significant \nrelationship with leverage in all countries.  Both findings confirm the postulated hypotheses \nthat firms tend to use their liquid assets to finance their investment in preference to raising \nexternal debt, and that they tend to prefer equity to debt when share prices are rising.  On the \nother hand, consistent with Wiwattanakantang (1999), earnings volatility (VOL) appears to \nhave no significant effect on leverage in any country. Firms may ignore the volatility of \nearnings if the risk and costs of entering into liquidation are low.  This may occur if the \nborrowing level of firms is well below their debt servicing capacity, as may be the case in \nAustralia, and if ownership is concentrated and family-based as in Thailand. \n In summary, the estimates presented in Table 4 for the whole sample period show some \nsimilarities across countries.  Non-tax debt shield, liquidity and share price performance \nappear to significantly influence the leverage decision in all countries, consistently with the \nstated hypotheses.  With the exception of Singapore where the state is more closely involved \nwith firms, size is also a very important determinant of capital structure in the region.  \nHowever, the results also highlight some disparities, possibly due to institutional, legal and \ngovernance differences between countries.  This will be further investigated in Section 4.2.3. \n \n 16 \n \n4.2.2 Cross-sectional results for individual countries and firm-specific effects by pre- and \npost-crisis periods \n The East-Asian financial crisis of 1997 originated in Thailand and spilled over to other \nAsian countries.  This severely affected the capital markets of the region.  In Thailand, \nMalaysia and Singapore, the value of the stock market fell by more than 30%, while Australia \nwas not directly affected.  The sudden and unexpected financial crisis of these high growth \neconomies also affected investors across the world.  Following the crisis, the East-Asian \ncapital markets experienced a significant outflow of foreign investment and their \ngovernments responded in different ways (Bank Negara Malaysia, 1998; Nesadurai, 2000; \nand Meesok et al., 2001).  Raising capital within the affected countries became more costly, \nas interest rates were raised and investors became more aware of risk and consequently \nexpected better investor protection. \n The results for the pre- and post-crisis periods presented in Table 4 show that the crisis \nappears to have affected the process of capital structure decision, implying that major \nchanges to the overall economic environment may significantly alter the determinants of \nfirm\u2019s decisions.  Generally, the significance of some of the determinants over the whole \nperiod, such as firm size, non-debt tax shield and liquidity, seems to be mainly driven by their \nsignificance in the post-crisis period.  On the contrary, the contribution of determinants, such \nas tangibility of assets, volatility of earnings and share price performance, seems to be \nunaffected by the crisis.  Finally, whenever the determinant is significant both before and \nafter the crisis, the coefficient, while of the same sign, has a significantly different impact in \nthe two periods, as indicated by the Wald test results presented in Table 4.  \n More specifically, the crisis seems to have influenced the role of firm size (SIZE) on \ncapital structure decision significantly.  Prior to the crisis, the role of firm size was not \nsignificant for both Thailand and Malaysia, but it became a significant factor after the crisis.  \n 17 \n \nEven in Singapore, where firm size was not significant over the whole period, it became \nsignificant after the crisis.  This may indicate that after the crisis firms became more \nconcerned with their survival and bankruptcy risk.  It is also possible that after the crisis \nlenders became more inclined to lend to larger firms in an attempt to decrease default risk.  \nOn the contrary, the role of growth opportunity (GROW) differs across the sample countries.  \nWhile for Thai firms growth became insignificant after the crisis, for Malaysian firms it is \nonly significant after the crisis.  This difference could be rationalised by the faster recovery of \nthe Malaysian economy as compared to Thailand.  As faster economic growth is associated \nwith the availability of more internal resources for companies, Malaysian growth firms tend \nto borrow less after the crisis according to the agency theory prediction. \n In relation to the non-debt tax shield (NDTS), the coefficient is insignificant before the \ncrisis but significant after the crisis for all countries.  No doubt, with the increased cost of \nborrowing and perceived risk of bankruptcy after the crisis, firms are likely to have looked \nfor alternative ways of minimising tax.  In this context, NDTS would have become more \nrelevant to the capital structure decision.  Although the coefficients of liquidity (LIQ) are \nsignificant and negative during both sub-sample periods for Thailand and Singapore, the \nWald test shows that for both countries the size of the coefficients increased significantly \nafter the crisis indicating its increased importance in capital structure.  Similarly, the \ncoefficient of the share price performance (SPP) in all countries except Australia, while \nsignificant both before and after the crisis, is significantly different between the two periods. \n Thus far the findings reveal that the capital structure decision is driven by both firm and \ncountry specific factors.  The 1997 financial crisis also appears to have impacted by different \ndegrees on different countries.  This highlights the importance of formally testing the impact \nof different institutional and legal factors, as well as economic conditions, on firm\u2019s \ndecisions. \n 18 \n \n4.2.3 Panel estimates with country-specific effects \n Table 5 presents the fixed country effect estimates of Equation 1 using a panel data set \nthat includes all companies across all countries over the sample period.  This is estimated \nover the whole sample period, as well as the pre- and post-crisis periods.  Additional country \nspecific variables have been included, as explained in Section 3.2 above, namely the financial \nactivity of the stock market, the interest rate and country dummies.  The results associated \nwith including creditor\u2019s rights and ownership structure, but excluding country dummies, will \nbe discussed later. \n[INSERT TABLE 5] \n \n Overall the results presented in Table 5 reveal similar relationships of leverage with \nfirm-specific determinants to the previous findings (Table 4).  They clearly show that the \n1997 financial crisis had an impact on the capital structure decision of firms in the region, at \nthe level of both firm-specific and country-specific determinants.  The relationship between \nthe financial activity of the stock market (FACT) and leverage is found to be significant and \nnegative as hypothesized in Section 3.2.  On the contrary, the interest rate (INT) variable has \nan insignificant relationship with leverage over the whole sample period and before the crisis, \nwhile it becomes significant and positive after the crisis.  This is not surprising given the \ncontradictory hypotheses formulated in Section 3.2 on the relationship between interest rates \nand leverage.  The positive finding for the period after the crisis suggests that firms may have \nbeen more concerned about the effects of future inflation on their cost of capital, than the \nimmediate risk of default, and support existing empirical evidence (Thies and Klock, 1992).  \nFinally, the country dummies confirm that leverage is influenced by country specific factors, \nsince almost all coefficients are statically significant, although of different sign.  According \nto a Wald test, they are also significantly different across countries.  \n 19 \n \n To test for more specific legal and institutional determinants, Equation 1 is estimated \nwith pooled OLS and substituting the country dummies first with an index of creditor\u2019s rights \n(CRR), and subsequently with a measure of ownership concentration (OWN), as explained in \nSection 3.2.  The coefficient estimates for CRR show a significant and positive relationship \nof this index with leverage over the whole sample period (0.027; t-ratio of 5.28) and after the \ncrisis (0.0413, t-ratio of 7.03) in accordance with the stated hypothesis, while before the crisis \nis marginally significant but negative (-0.0153; t-ratio of \u20131.7).  Overall this finding confirms \nthat borrowing is likely to be higher when creditors are better protected by law.  The \nestimated coefficients for OWN are significant and positive for the whole sample period \n(0.316; t-ratio of 5.18) and after the crisis (0.532; t-ratio of 7.5), but significant and negative \nbefore the crisis (-0.245; t-ratio of \u20132.57). As discussed in section 3.2, both agency and \nsignaling theories predict a negative relationship between ownership concentration and \nleverage because of the role of debt in mitigating both moral hazard and adverse selection \nproblems.  The pre-crisis result is consistent with the theory and the findings of previous \nstudies (Wiwattanakantang, 1999; and Suto, 2003).  However, the positive relationship found \nfor the post-crisis period confirms that theories developed to explain behavior in major \ndeveloped markets might not apply to emerging economies.  In all the sample countries, with \nthe exception of Australia, ownership is highly concentrated (see Table 1), with family \nholdings being a significant proportion.  It is thus to be expected that there will be less \nasymmetries of information between owners and lenders, with lower transaction costs and \neasier access to borrowing.  In uncertain times, like in the aftermath of a major crisis, the \nclose relationship between borrowing firms and lenders is likely to become a more important \ndeterminant than market-based explanations.  Thus, firms owned by a family or a small group \nof well-known investors may find borrowing easier. \n \n 20 \n \n5. Concluding Remarks \nThe paper sets out to test for countries in the Asia Pacific region the findings of extant \ntheoretical and empirical literature on the determinants of capital structure.  Overall the \nresults support existing evidence with respect to firm-specific determinants.  However, they \nalso show some significant differences between the sample countries, and thus the paper also \nseeks to test for country specific determinants.  In addition, since the sample period straddles \nacross the 1997 Asian Crisis, the paper investigates the impact of the crisis on the capital \nstructure decision.  \nFirstly, the positive effect of firm size and the negative effect of growth opportunities, \nnon-debt tax shield, liquidity and share price performance on leverage lend support to major \ncapital structure theories.  Secondly, the importance of the determinants of capital structure \nvaries across countries in the region.  For instance, profitability has significant influence on \nthe capital structure of Malaysian firms and firm size has no effect on Singaporean firms.  \nThese differences confirm that managerial decisions may be affected by country specific \nconsiderations.  This inference is supported by the findings following the introduction of \ncountry dummy variables and country specific variables, such as the level of stock market\u2019s \nactivity, interest rates, creditor\u2019s rights and ownership concentration.  Thirdly, the financial \ncrisis of 1997 is found to have altered the role of both firm and country specific factors.  For \ninstance, the relationship between leverage and firm specific variables such as firm size, \ngrowth opportunities, non-debt tax shield, and liquidity, has altered between the pre- and \npost-crisis periods.  In summary, the capital structure decision is not only the product of the \nfirm\u2019s own characteristics but also the result of the corporate governance, legal framework \nand institutional environment of the countries in which the firm operates. \n 21 \n \nReferences \n \nAntoniou, A., Y.
