Skokan\nK\n(k)\nN with N vertices yields a monochromatic copy of H . A classical result in graph Ramsey\ntheory ([1, 5, 18]) states that for k = 2 and n \u0002 5 the Ramsey number of the graph cycle\nCn with n vertices is\nr(Cn) =\n{\n3\n2\nn \u2212 1 if n is even,\n2n \u2212 1 if n is odd.\nThus, the Ramsey numbers for graph cycles depend strongly on the parity of n.\nIn this paper we continue our study of Ramsey numbers for 3-uniform hyper-\ncycles, initiated in [11]. There are various definitions of a cycle in a 3-uniform hy-\npergraph. Given a suitably labelled set of vertices {v1, . . . , vn}, a loose cycle has edge set\n{v1v2v3, v3v4v5, v5v6v7, . . . , vn\u22121vnv1}, while the tight cycle, denoted henceforth by C (3)n , has\nthe edge set\n{v1v2v3, v2v3v4, v3v4v5, . . . , vn\u22121vnv1, vnv1v2}.\nIn [11] we proved that the Ramsey number for the n-vertex loose cycle, n even, is\nasymptotic to 5n\/4. (Note that loose cycles do not exist for n odd.) Subsequently, Gya\u00b4rfa\u00b4s,\nSa\u00b4rko\u00a8zy and Szemere\u00b4di [8] extended this result to k-uniform loose cycles.\nHere an analogous problem is investigated for tight cycles. So far, the only known value\nof the Ramsey number for a tight cycle is r(C (3)4 ) = 13 (see [16]). Asymptotically, it turns\nout that the Ramsey number for the tight cycle is larger than that for the loose cycle, and\ndepends on whether n is divisible by 3. Thus, in this respect, tight cycles behave more like\ngraph cycles than loose cycles do. Our aim is to prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 1.1.\n(a) For every integer n \u0002 1 and i = 0, 1, 2,\nr(C (3)3n+i) \u0002\n{\n4n \u2212 1 if i = 0,\n6n+ 2i \u2212 1 if i \u0004= 0.\n(b) Let \u03b7 > 0 be given. Then for all sufficiently large n and i = 0, 1, 2,\nr(C (3)3n+i) \u0003\n{\n(4 + \u03b7)n if i = 0,\n(6 + \u03b7)n if i \u0004= 0.\nWe should mention that one more natural definition of cycle for hypergraphs is the\nso-called Berge cycle. The Ramsey number for Berge cycles was investigated by Gya\u00b4rfa\u00b4s,\nSa\u00b4rko\u00a8zy and Szemere\u00b4di [9, 10].\nThe proof of part (a) and Theorem 1.1(b) also yield the asymptotic value of the Ramsey\nnumber of tight paths. A (tight) path P (3)n is a hypergraph with vertices v1, . . . , vn and\nedges v1v2v3, v2v3v4, . . . , vn\u22122vn\u22121vn.\nCorollary 1.2. r(P (3)n ) = (4\/3 + o(1))n, where o(1) \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e.\nThe loose and tight cycles are examples of hypergraphs with bounded maximum degree.\nFor this class of hypergraphs, it was conjectured that their Ramsey number is linear in\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 167\ntheir number of vertices. This conjecture was confirmed in [14, 3, 4] using the regularity\nmethod for hypergraphs. Recently, Conlon, Fox and Sudakov [2] managed to prove the\nsame result without the regularity method.\nIn the next section we prove the lower bounds and outline the proofs of the upper\nbounds. Their complete proofs are deferred to Section 5.\n2. Lower bounds and the outline of the main proof\nMost of the work in proving Theorem 1.1 lies in the upper bounds. In this section, we\nbegin by establishing the lower bounds (Theorem 1.1(a)), and then we sketch the main\nideas needed for Theorem 1.1(b), which include a notion of connectedness for 3-uniform\nhypergraphs. Since all hypergraphs considered in this paper are 3-uniform, we will more\nconcisely call them hypergraphs.\n2.1. Proof of lower bounds\nThe first lower bound is based on relation between cycles and matchings. Let M(3)n be a\n3-uniform 3n-vertex matching, that is, a hypergraph consisting of n disjoint edges. Observe\nthat C (3)3n contains M\n(3)\nn , and so r(C\n(3)\n3n ) \u0002 r(M(3)n ).\nProof of Theorem 1.1(a). To prove that r(C (3)3n ) \u0002 4n \u2212 1, partition the vertex set of\nK\n(3)\n4n\u22122 into two parts, X and Y , where |X| = 3n \u2212 1, |Y | = n \u2212 1, and colour all edges\ninside X red and all other edges blue. It is easily seen that this colouring contains no\nmonochromatic M(3)n , and thus no monochromatic copy of C\n(3)\n3n . (Unlike in the case of\ngraphs, the above extremal colouring is not unique. For another one, see Example 1 in\nSubsection 2.2.)\nTo prove that r(C (3)3n+i) \u0002 6n+ 2i \u2212 1, i = 1, 2, partition the vertex set of K (3)6n+2i\u22122 into\ntwo parts, X and Y , where |X| = |Y | = 3n+ i \u2212 1, and colour red [blue] all edges with\nan odd [even] number of elements in X. An edge containing a vertex of X and a vertex\nof Y is called crossing.\nSuppose that there is a red copy C of C (3)3n+i in such a colouring. Since |X| < 3n+ i, at\nleast one edge of C is crossing. But then, by the definition of a tight cycle, every edge\nof C is crossing, that is, every edge of C contains one vertex of X and two of Y . This\nmeans that every third vertex of C belongs to X, which is impossible when i \u0004= 0.\nNote that the first construction in the above proof implies that r(M(3)n ) \u0002 4n \u2212 1, and\nso, in view of Theorem 1.1, r(M(3)n ) and r(C\n(3)\n3n ) are asymptotically equal. In fact, it is easy\nto prove that r(M(3)n ) = 4n \u2212 1.\nClearly, every path P (3)3n+i, i = 0, 1, 2, contains the matching M\n(3)\nn and it is contained in\nC\n(3)\n3n+3. Hence we have 4n \u2212 1 = r(M(3)n ) \u0003 r(P (3)3n+i) \u0003 r(C (3)3n+3), and Corollary 1.2 follows\nfrom Theorem 1.1(b).\nA common extension of the above constructions yields that for all n \u0002 k \u0002 2 we have\nr(C (k)n ) \u0002 (d+ 1)n\/d, where C (k)n is the k-uniform tight cycle1 of length n = i (mod k) and\n1 The k-uniform tight cycle C\n(k)\nn is the k-uniform hypergraph with vertices v1, . . . , vn and the edge set\n{v1+iv2+i \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vk\u22121+ivk+i : i = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1}, where, for i > 0, we set vn+i := vi.\n168 P.

We conjecture that the actual value\nof r(C (k)n ) is asymptotically equal to (d+ 1)n\/d.\n2.2. Paths, pseudo-paths and connectedness\nConsider a tight path with vertices v1, . . . , vp+2 and edges v1v2v3, v2v3v4, . . . , vpvp+1vp+2.\nThe pairs (v1, v2) and (vp+2, vp+1) are called the endpairs of the path. (Note the reverse\norder of the latter pair which emphasizes the symmetry of the path.) The length of a path\non p+ 2 vertices is equal to p, the number of edges.\nA pseudo-path in a hypergraph H is a sequence (e1, . . . , ep) of not necessarily distinct\nedges of H such that |ei \u2229 ei+1| = 2 for each i = 1, . . . , p \u2212 1. In particular, the edges\nof every path can be ordered (in two ways) to form a pseudo-path. If (e1, . . . , ep) is a\npseudo-path in H then we say that e1 and ep are connected in H by a pseudo-path. Unlike\nfor paths, this defines an equivalence relation and we call the equivalence classes the\ncomponents of H .\nA hypergraph H is connected if every two edges e, f \u2208 H are connected by a pseudo-\npath. Note that there are several ways to define connectedness in hypergraphs (cf. [11]),\nbut in this paper we will always mean the one defined above. A sub-hypergraph H \u2032\nof H is externally connected (in H) if every two edges e, f \u2208 H \u2032 are connected in H by a\npseudo-path. In other words, there is a component C of H that contains H \u2032.\nExample 1. Consider a 3-uniform hypergraph with vertex set V = X \u222a Y , X,Y \u0004= \u2205, and\na red\u2013blue colouring where every edge with an odd intersection with X is coloured red\nand all other edges are coloured blue. Then the red sub-hypergraph has two components,\none consisting of all edges contained in X, the other formed by all edges with one vertex\nin X and two in Y .\nClearly, every red tight cycle must be entirely contained in one of these two components,\na fact utilized already in the proof of Theorem 1.1(a), i \u0004= 0. Moreover, with |X| = |Y | =\n2n \u2212 1 this yields an alternative \u2018extremal colouring\u2019 in the proof of Theorem 1.1(a), i = 0.\nIndeed, neither of the two red components contains a cycle of length 3n. As a matter of\nfact, none of them contains an externally connected matching of size n.\n2.3. Monochromatic matchings in colourings of almost complete hypergraphs\nThe basic idea of our proof, similar to that given by \u0002Luczak [13] and Figaj and \u0002Luczak\n[6] (see also [11]), is to apply to the coloured complete (hyper)graph the regularity lemma,\nfind in the cluster (hyper)graph a large structure of a certain type, and use this structure\nto obtain a long, monochromatic cycle.\nThus, a crucial role in the proof of Theorem 1.1(b) is played by the two following\nRamsey-type results on externally connected matchings. We state them now, but their\nproofs are deferred to the end of the paper.\nLemma 2.1. For every \u03b7 > 0 there exist \u03b4 > 0 and s0 such that the following holds. Let\nK be a hypergraph with t = (4 + \u03b7)s vertices, s \u0002 s0, and at least (1 \u2212 \u03b4)(t3) edges. Then,\nfor every red\u2013blue colouring K = Kred \u222a Kblue, either Kred or Kblue contains an externally\nconnected matching M(3)s .\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 169\nThe proof, given in Section 8, is so technically involved that, for the sake of the reader, it\nis preceded in Section 6 by its \u2018idealized\u2019 version with \u03b7 = \u03b4 = 0. There we will prove that\nthe Ramsey number r(M(3)s ) = 4s \u2212 1 does not increase when the matching is requested\nto be externally connected in one of the colours (cf. Theorem 6.1).\nTo deal with the case i \u0004= 0, we will need the following modification of Lemma 2.1.\nLemma 2.2. For every \u03b7 > 0 there exist \u03b4 > 0 and s0 such that the following holds. Let\nK be a hypergraph with t = (6 + \u03b7)s vertices, s \u0002 s0, and at least (1 \u2212 \u03b4)(t3) edges. Then,\nfor every red\u2013blue colouring K = Kred \u222a Kblue, either Kred or Kblue contains an externally\nconnected union of a matching M(3)s and a cycle C\n(3)\n4 or C\n(3)\n5 .\nWhy does the size of the largest monochromatic, externally connected matching found\nin a red\u2013blue coloured K go down from t\/4 to t\/6, if it has to be accompanied by a copy\nof C (3)4 or C\n(3)\n5 ? The answer can be provided by the second construction in the proof of\nTheorem 1.1(a) (see Section 2.1). Indeed, that construction yields a colouring of K6s+2i\u22122\nwithout any externally connected, monochromatic copy of a vertex-disjoint union of M(3)s1\nand C (3)3s2+i, s = s1 + s2, i = 1, 2. Although in Lemma 2.2 we do not assume that a copy\nof C (3)4 or C\n(3)\n5 has to be disjoint from the matching, it can be reduced to the disjoint case\nby disregarding at most five edges of the matching. This small loss does not affect the\nasymptotics of Lemma 2.2.\nThe proof of Lemma 2.2 is based on Lemma 2.1 and quite similar to its proof, but even\nmore technical. Therefore, we decided to include only a proof of an idealized version of\nLemma 2.2 (cf. Theorem 7.1). The full version can be be found in [12].\n2.4. Outline of the proof of upper bounds\nWe first consider the case of C (3)3n . Let K\n(3)\nN = Hred \u222a Hblue, where N \u223c 4n, be a red\u2013blue\ncolouring of the edges of the complete 3-uniform hypergraph K (3)N .\nWe apply simultaneously, to both Hred and Hblue, the hypergraph regularity lemma\n(Theorem 3.2) with suitably chosen parameters, and obtain a vertex partition V = V1 \u222a\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a Vt, |Vi| \u223c N\/t, such that for almost all triples {i, j, k} one of the induced sub-\nhypergraphs, Hred[Vi \u222a Vj \u222a Vk] or Hblue[Vi \u222a Vj \u222a Vk], is \u2018well structured\u2019, that is, enjoys\nhigh regularity and large density (see Section 5 for details).\nWe prove in Section 4 that a \u2018well-structured\u2019 hypergraph contains a long path\n(Lemma 4.6), in our case of length almost 3N\/t. We will build a monochromatic copy\nof C (3)3n mostly out of such paths, coming from about t\/4 vertex-disjoint \u2018well-structured\u2019\nhypergraphs. Thus, it is crucial to find about t\/4 disjoint, but mutually connected, \u2018well-\nstructured\u2019 sub-hypergraphs in one colour.\nTo this end, let Kred and Kblue be two auxiliary hypergraphs on the vertex set {1, 2, . . . , t},\nwhose edges are those triples {i, j, k} for which Hred[Vi \u222a Vj \u222a Vk] or Hblue[Vi \u222a Vj \u222a Vk],\nrespectively, contains a \u2018well-structured\u2019 sub-hypergraph. Set K = Kred \u222a Kblue and note\nthat |K| \u223c (t\n3\n)\n. We call K the cluster hypergraph and the edges of K the cluster edges.\nBy Lemma 2.1 either Kred or Kblue (say, Kred) contains an externally connected matching\nM = M(3)s of size s \u223c t\/4. Next, using Lemma 4.6, we will find a long path in each\n170 P. E. Haxell, T. \u0002Luczak, Y. Peng, V. Ro\u00a8dl, A. Rucin\u00b4ski and J. Skokan\nsub-hypergraph Hred[Vi, Vj , Vk], where {i, j, k} \u2208 M. These paths are disjoint and have\ntotal length of about (t\/4) \u00d7 (3N\/t) = 3N\/4 \u223c 3n (in fact, 3n \u2212 O(1)).\nTo connect the long paths together into a red cycle of length 3n, we will construct in Hred\nshort paths (length O(1)) between the endpairs of long paths, being guided by the pseudo-\npaths linking in Kred the cluster edges of M\n(3)\ns (in reality, we build the short paths first).\nThe case of C (3)3n+i, i = 1, 2, requires just one modification: in addition to an externally\nconnected, monochromatic matching in K , we will need a copy of a cycle of length not\ndivisible by three in the same colour. This is provided by Lemma 2.2, which guarantees\nin either Kred or Kblue the existence of an externally connected sub-hypergraph which is a\nunion of M(3)s , s \u223c t\/6, and a copy of either C (3)4 or C (3)5 . Due to the presence of a cluster\ncycle of length not divisible by three, we will be able to adjust the length of the final cycle\nto be equal to one or two modulo three (by running once or twice around the cluster\ncycle \u2013 see Section 5 for more details).\nIn the next section we introduce the regularity of hypergraphs and present a corres-\nponding regularity lemma. In Section 4 we prove the existence of paths of prescribed\nlength in quasi-random hypergraphs (Lemma 4.6), one of the two main ingredients of the\nproof of Theorem 1.1(b). In Section 5 we put together the main proof, and, finally, in\nSections 6\u20138 we provide the proofs of the second crucial ingredient, Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2.\n3. Regularity of hypergraphs\nIn this section we describe the regularity lemma for hypergraphs established in [7], in\na modified version presented in [17]. To do this we will need to refer to the notion of\n\u0004-regularity for graphs, the key idea in Szemere\u00b4di\u2019s Regularity Lemma [19].\n3.1. Graph regularity\nFor a graph G and two disjoint sets of vertices X,Y \u2286 V (G), we write EG(X,Y ) for the\nset of edges of G that have one end in X and the other in Y . The density dG(X,Y ) of G\nover the pair (X,Y ) is defined by\ndG(X,Y ) =\n|EG(X,Y )|\n|X||Y | .\nWe denote by G[X,Y ] the bipartite subgraph of G induced by vertex classes X and Y .\nNote that EG(X,Y ) is the edge set of G[X,Y ].\nLet G be a bipartite graph with vertex classes X and Y and let 0 \u0003 d \u0003 1 and \u0004 > 0\nbe given. We say that G is (d, \u0004)-regular, if, for all X \u2032 \u2286 X and Y \u2032 \u2286 Y with |X \u2032| \u0002 \u0004|X|\nand |Y \u2032| \u0002 \u0004|Y |, we have\n|dG(X \u2032, Y \u2032) \u2212 d| < \u0004.\nWe say that G is \u0004-regular if it is (d, \u0004)-regular with d = dG(X,Y ).\n3.2. Hypergraph regularity\nWe now turn to hypergraph regularity. A triple (P 12, P 13, P 23) of bipartite graphs with\nvertex sets V1 \u222a V2, V1 \u222a V3 and V2 \u222a V3, or equivalently, the 3-partite graph P = P 12 \u222a\nP 13 \u222a P 23 itself, will be referred to as a triad.\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 171\nIn what follows we often need to focus on the set of edges of a hypergraph H that are\nalso vertex sets of triangles in a fixed triad P with V (P ) \u2286 V (H). We denote by Tr(P ) the\nfamily of the vertex sets of the triangles in the graph P , and set tr(P ) = |Tr(P )|. Thus,\nfor any P , Tr(P ) is a 3-uniform hypergraph on the same vertex set as P . Moreover, Tr(P )\nis 3-partite in the sense that every edge intersects each set V1, V2 and V3.\nFurther, we define the notion of the density of H with respect to P as\ndH (P ) =\n|H \u2229 Tr(P )|\n|Tr(P )| .\nSimilarly, for every r-tuple of triads \u0005Q = (Q(1), Q(2), . . . ,Q(r)), let\ndH \u0005(Q) =\n|H \u2229\u22c3rp=1 Tr(Q(p))|\n|\u22c3rp=1 Tr(Q(p))| .\nNote that in the definition above, the sets of triangles Tr(Q(p)) need not be pairwise\ndisjoint.\nNext, we define the notion of regularity for 3-uniform hypergraphs. Given a triad\nP = P 12 \u222a P 13 \u222a P 23, by a sub-triad we mean a triad Q = Q12 \u222a Q13 \u222a Q23 where\nQ12 \u2286 P 12, Q13 \u2286 P 13, Q23 \u2286 P 23.\nDefinition 3.1. Let \u03b4 > 0 and \u03b1 > 0, and let r be a positive integer. Further, let H be a\n3-uniform hypergraph with V (H) \u2287 V (P ).\n\u2022 We say that H is (\u03b1, \u03b4, r)-regular with respect to a triad P if, for every r-tuple\nof sub-triads \u0005Q = (Q(1), Q(2), . . . , Q(r)) satisfying |\u22c3rp=1 Tr(Q(p))| > \u03b4|Tr(P )|, we have\n|dH \u0005(Q) \u2212 \u03b1| < \u03b4.\n\u2022 We say that H is (\u03b4, r)-regular with respect to P if it is (\u03b1, \u03b4, r)-regular with \u03b1 = dH(P ).\n\u2022 A triad P with respect to which H is (\u03b4, r)-regular will be called (\u03b4, r)-regular.\nOtherwise, it will be called (\u03b4, r)-irregular .\n\u2022 Moreover, if each graph P 12, P 13, P 23 of an (\u03b1, \u03b4, r)-regular triad P = P 12 \u222a P 13 \u222a P 23\nis (1\/\u0007, \u0004)-regular, then we call the pair (H,P ) an (\u03b1, \u03b4, \u0007, r, \u0004)-regular complex .\nObserve that if Hc is the complement of H then dH \u0005(Q) = 1 \u2212 dHc \u0005(Q). Consequently, if\nH is (\u03b1, \u03b4, r)-regular, then Hc is (1 \u2212 \u03b1, \u03b4, r)-regular with respect to the same triad P .\n3.3. Regularity Lemma for Hypergraphs\nWe now state the regularity lemma for 3-uniform hypergraphs from [7] in a simplified\nform presented in [17] (see Lemma 4.1 and Remark 4.1 there). We write K(U,W ) for the\ncomplete bipartite graph with vertex sets U and W .\nTheorem 3.2 (Regularity Lemma for Hypergraphs). For every \u03b4 > 0, every integer t0, all\ninteger-valued functions r = r(t, \u0007), and all decreasing sequences \u03b5(\u0007) > 0, there exist con-\nstants T0, L0 and N0 such that every 3-uniform hypergraph H with at least N0 vertices admits\na partition \u03a0 consisting of an auxiliary vertex set partition V (H) = V0 \u222a V1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a Vt,\nwhere t0 \u0003 t < T0, |V0| < t and |V1| = |V2| = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = |Vt|, and, for each pair i, j, 1 \u0003 i < j \u0003 t,\n172 P. E. Haxell, T. \u0002Luczak, Y. Peng, V. Ro\u00a8dl, A. Rucin\u00b4ski and J. Skokan\na partition K(Vi, Vj) =\n\u22c3\u0007\na=1 P\nij\na , where 1 \u0003 \u0007 < L0, satisfying the following conditions:\n(i) all graphs P ija are (1\/\u0007, \u03b5(\u0007))-regular,\n(ii) H is (\u03b4, r)-regular with respect to all but at most \u03b4\u00073t3 triads (Phia , P\nhj\nb , P\nij\nc ).\nNote that the conclusions of Theorem 3.2 hold for the complement Hc of H as well.\nSince the outcome of the regularity lemma may be overwhelming, we simplify the\npicture a little bit by selecting only one graph P ija from each K(Vi, Vj).\nClaim 3.3. Given the partition produced by Theorem 3.2, there exists a family P of bipartite\ngraphs P ij = P ijaij , one between each pair (Vi, Vj), where 1 \u0003 i < j \u0003 t, such that H is (\u03b4, r)-\nregular with respect to all but at most 2\u03b4t3 triads (Phi, P hj , P ij).\nProof. We apply the probabilistic method. For all 1 \u0003 i < j \u0003 t, choose an index aij \u2208\n{1, 2, . . . , \u0007} independently and uniformly at random. The selected indices determine a\n(random) family P of (t\n2\n)\nbipartite graphs. By condition (ii) of Theorem 3.2, the expected\nnumber of (\u03b4, r)-irregular triads of P is at most \u03b4t3\u00073(1\/\u0007)3 = \u03b4t3, and hence, by Markov\u2019s\ninequality, the probability that there are more than 2\u03b4t3 such triads is less than 1\/2. Thus,\nthere exists a selection P with fewer than 2\u03b4t3 (\u03b4, r)-irregular triads.\n4. A long, long path\nOur goal in this section is to find tight hyperpaths of given lengths connecting two\ndesignated edges of P in an (\u03b1, \u03b4, \u0007, r, \u03b5)-complex (H,P ), as defined in Definition 3.1. To\ndistinguish the hypergraph edges from the graph edges, in this section the former will be\ncalled hyperedges . On the other hand, as in the whole paper, we will use the name \u2018path\u2019\ninstead of \u2018hyperpath\u2019.\n4.1. Short paths\nRecall that a tight path of length m was defined as a hypergraph with vertices v1,\nv2, . . . , vm+2 and the m hyperedges v1v2v3, . . . , vmvm+1vm+2. We shall call the (ordered) pairs\n(v1, v2) and (vm+2, vm+1) the endpairs of the path, while the vertices v3, . . . , vm are called\ninternal vertices . Two paths are said to be internally disjoint if they do not share any\ninternal vertex.\nNote that the endpairs of a 3-uniform path are ordered pairs of vertices. However,\nin a 3-partite 3-uniform hypergraph H on vertex set V1 \u222a V2 \u222a V3, we may designate\none cyclic orientation, say V1 \u2192 V2 \u2192 V3 \u2192 V1, as canonical, and view the endpairs of\npaths as unordered pairs of vertices, or simply the edges of the underlying graph P .\nThen saying that a path goes from e to f is not ambiguous and means that the endpairs\nof the paths are the edges e and f directed by the canonical ordering. For example,\nlet e = ab and f = cd be two edges, where a, d \u2208 V1, b, c \u2208 V2. Then, under the above\ncanonical orientation, a path going from edge e to edge f is a path with the endpairs (a, b)\nand (c, d).\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 173\nFigure 1. The fourth neighbourhoods of e (g \u2208 Four\u2212(e, H), h \u2208 Four+(e, H)).\nDefinition 4.1. With the convention that ijk is the canonical cyclic orientation, we say\nthat an ordered pair of edges (e, f), where e \u2208 P ij , is of type 1 if f \u2208 P jk , of type 2 if\nf \u2208 P ik , and of type 3 if f \u2208 P ij . We denote the type of (e, f) by type(e, f).\nThus, every path from e to f has some length m such that\nm \u2261 type(e, f) (mod 3).\nSet\n\u03b30 =\n\u03b14\n5000\u00077\n.\nDefinition 4.2. Let e1, e2 be two edges of P and let x be a positive integer. We say that\ne1 \u03b30-reaches e2 within H if there exist at least \u03b30|V (H)| internally disjoint paths in H of\nlength 4 from e1 to e2.\nFor an edge e \u2208 P we denote by Four+(e,H) the set of those edges of P which are\n\u03b30-reached from e within H and by Four\n\u2212(e,H) the set of all edges of P which \u03b30-reach e\nwithin H (see Figure 1). Owing to the canonical orientation in which all paths proceed,\nthe sets Four+(e,H) and Four\u2212(e,H) are contained in different subgraphs P ij , and thus\nare disjoint.\nIn [15] the following result is proved. For a subset S \u2282 V (H) a path Q \u2282 H is called\nS-avoiding if V (Q) \u2229 S = \u2205. Given a graph G with V (G) = V (H), we denote by H \u2212 G the\nsub-hypergraph of H obtained by removing from H all hyperedges containing at least\none edge of G.\nTheorem 4.3 ([15]). For each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) there exists \u03b4 > 0 and sequences r(\u0007), \u03b5(\u0007), and\nn0(\u0007) such that for all integers \u0007 \u0002 1 the following holds.

In view of Corollary 4.4(ii), we may assume that m \u0002 13. In this case we will\napply Corollary 4.4(ii) twice. First we find in H an S-avoiding path Q1 from e to f of\nlength m0 = 10, 11, or 12, depending on the type of (e, f). Note that m0 \u2261 m (mod 3), and\nthus m \u2212 m0 is divisible by three.\nConsider the initial segment Q\u20321 of Q1 of length m \u2212 m0, and call its other endpair e\u2032\n(note that type(e\u2032, f) = type(e, f)). Now, find in H an (S \u222a V (Q\u20321)\\e\u2032)-avoiding path Q2\nfrom e\u2032 to f of length m0. Then, the concatenation Q\u20321 + Q2 forms in H an S-avoiding\npath from e to f of length m.\n4.2. Long paths\nIt was shown in [15] that (\u03b1, \u03b4, \u0007, r, \u03b5)-complexes contain long paths. Here we strengthen\nthat result by showing that, in fact, most pairs of edges of the underlying graph P are\nconnected in H by paths of any given, feasible length m, for a wide range of m.\nLemma 4.6. For each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) there exists \u03b4 > 0 and sequences r(\u0007), \u03b5(\u0007), and n1(\u0007) with\nthe following property. For all integers \u0007 \u0002 1, if (H,P ) is a (dH (P ), \u03b4, \u0007, r(\u0007), \u03b5(\u0007))-complex\nwith dH (P ) \u0002 \u03b1 and |V1| = |V2| = |V3| = n > n1(\u0007), then there is a subgraph P0 of at most\n27\n\u221a\n\u03b4n2\/\u0007 edges of P such that, for all ordered pairs of disjoint edges (e, f) \u2208 (P\\P0) \u00d7\n(P\\P0), for every set S \u2282 V (H)\\(e \u222a f), |S | < n\/(log n)2, and for all integers m from the\nrange\n10 \u0003 m \u0003 (1 \u2212 \u03b41\/4)(3n),\nwith m = type(e, f) (mod 3), there is in H an S-avoiding path from e to f of length m.\nProof. Note that unlike in Claim 4.5, here we need to construct a possibly very long\npath from e to f. This will be achieved by a repeated application of Corollary 4.4(i).\nThere is a minor, but irritating difference, however, in the set-ups of Corollary 4.4 and\nLemma 4.6: in the former, the hypergraph density was roughly equal to \u03b1, while now\nwe have a hypergraph H satisfying dH (P ) \u0002 \u03b1. To circumvent this technical obstacle,\nwe consider a random sub-hypergraph HR \u2282 H , where each hyperedge of H is present\nindependently with probability \u03b1\/dH (P ). By Chernoff\u2019s bound, the pair (HR, P ) is an\n(\u03b1, 2\u03b4, \u0007, r(\u0007), \u03b5(\u0007))-complex. Clearly, if HR contains the desired path then so does H . By\nresetting H := HR and \u03b4 := \u03b4\/2, we thus reduce Lemma 4.6 to the instance when (H,P )\nis an (\u03b1, \u03b4, \u0007, r(\u0007), \u03b5(\u0007))-complex.\nGiven \u03b1, let \u03b4 > 0 and the sequences r(\u0007), \u03b51(\u0007), and n0(\u0007) be such that Corollary 4.4\nholds with \u03b4\u2032 = 4\u03b4 14 in place of \u03b4, r(\u0007), \u03b51(\u0007) in place of \u03b5(\u0007), and n0(\u0007). Set \u03b5(\u0007) = \u03b4\n1\n4 \u03b51(\u0007).\nAssume also that\n27\n\u221a\n4\u03b4\n1\n4 <\n\u03b14\n2000\n. (4.1)\nWe will prove Lemma 4.6 with the above choice of \u03b4, r(\u0007) and \u03b5(\u0007), and with a choice\nof n1(\u0007) \u0002 n0(\u0007) such that for all \u0007 \u0002 1 and n \u0002 n1(\u0007) all inequalities encountered in\nthe proof below hold true. Let (H,P ) be an (\u03b1, \u03b4, \u0007, r(\u0007), \u03b5(\u0007))-complex and P0 = P0(H)\nbe given by Corollary 4.4, where |V1| = |V2| = |V3| = n > n1 = n1(\u0007). Let us fix an\n176 P. E. Haxell, T. \u0002Luczak, Y. Peng, V. Ro\u00a8dl, A. Rucin\u00b4ski and J. Skokan\nordered pair of disjoint edges (e, f) \u2208 (P\\P0) \u00d7 (P\\P0), and a set S \u2282 V (H)\\(e \u222a f),\n|S | < n\/(log n)2. Finally, fix an integer m from the range 10 \u0003 m \u0003 (1 \u2212 \u03b41\/4)(3n), with\nm \u2261 type(e, f) (mod 3).\nOur goal is to show that there exists an S-avoiding path from e to f of length m. Without\nloss of generality, let us assume that type(e, f) = 3, e = ab \u2208 P 12 and f = cd \u2208 P 12, where\na, d \u2208 V1 and b, c \u2208 V2.\nThe plan is to first grow, by recursive application of Corollary 4.4(i), two disjoint\nS-avoiding paths Qe and Qf of equal length m\n\u2032, one from e, the other from f, until their\ntotal length 2m\u2032 reaches roughly m. Then, making sure that 10 \u0003 m \u2212 2m\u2032 \u0003 17, we will use\nClaim 4.5 to connect the other endpairs of these two paths to form in H an S-avoiding\npath from e to f of length precisely m.\nThe two \u2018parallel\u2019 paths will be grown recursively, in increments of four, using the\nproperty of the sets Four+(e\u2032, H) and Four+(f\u2032, H), where e\u2032 and f\u2032 will denote the current\nendpairs. Thus, we must take care to always choose the extending paths so that the new\nendpairs are outside the exceptional set P0 of the current sub-hypergraph. To this end, at\nany given step of this procedure, we will have to consider two sub-hypergraphs defined\nas follows.\nGiven two disjoint paths, Qe from e and Qf from f, of equal length m\n\u2032, let H \u2032 =\nH \u2032(Qe, Qf) be the sub-hypergraph obtained from H by deleting all vertices of Qe and\nQf , except for the last four from each path (if m\n\u2032 \u0003 4, we set H \u2032 = H). Further, let the\nsub-hypergraph H \u2032\u2032 = H \u2032\u2032(Qe, Qf) be obtained from H by deleting all vertices of Qe and\nQf (no exceptions). Set also P\n\u2032 = P [V (H \u2032)] and P \u2032\u2032 = P [V (H \u2032\u2032)]. As long as\n|V (Qe) \u222a V (Qf)| = 2m\u2032 < (1 \u2212 \u03b41\/4)(3n),\nthe hypergraphs H \u2032 and H \u2032\u2032 have at least \u03b41\/4n vertices in each set Vi, i = 1, 2, 3,\nand so, the pairs (H \u2032, P \u2032) and (H \u2032\u2032, P \u2032\u2032) are (\u03b1, 4\u03b4 14 , \u0007, r, \u03b5\/\u03b4 14 )-complexes (see, e.g., [17,\nFact 4.2]). Let P \u20320 and P \u2032\u20320 be the subgraphs of P \u2032 and P \u2032\u2032, respectively, guaranteed by\nCorollary 4.4.\nAs a next step in the proof of Lemma 4.6, we show that two long paths can be grown\nfrom e and f. Their length m\u2032, due to the chosen method of construction, will be a multiple\nof four.\nFact 4.7. For every 0 \u0003 m\u2032 < 1\n2\n(1 \u2212 \u03b41\/4)(3n), m\u2032 divisible by four, there exists in H a pair\nof disjoint S-avoiding paths Qe and Qf of length m\n\u2032, originating from e and f, respectively,\nand such that their other endpairs are not in P \u20320 .\nProof. We proceed by induction on m\u2032. There is nothing to prove for m\u2032 = 0. Let Qe and\nQf be a pair of disjoint S-avoiding paths, one from e and the other from f, of the same\nlength m\u2032 \u0002 0, m\u2032 divisible by four, and such that their other endpairs, e\u2032 and f\u2032, are not\nin P \u20320. (If m\u2032 = 0, we set e\u2032 = e and f\u2032 = f.) We will now show how to extend Qe and Qf\nto a new pair of paths Q\u2032e and Q\u2032f of length m\u2032 + 4, thus completing the inductive step.\n(The reader may be guided throughout by Figure 2.)\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 177\nFigure 2. Growing hyperpaths from e and f (illustration to the proof of Lemma 4.6).\nNoticing that |V (H \u2032\u2032)| < |V (H \u2032)| and \u03b5\/\u03b4 14 = \u03b51(\u0007), by Corollary 4.4 applied to H \u2032\u2032 we\nhave\n|P \u2032\u20320 | \u0003 27\n\u221a\n4\u03b4\n1\n4\n\u0012|V (H \u2032\u2032)|\/3\u00132\n\u0007\n< 27\n\u221a\n4\u03b4\n1\n4\n\u0014|V (H \u2032)|\/3\u00152\n\u0007\n. (4.2)\nOn the other hand, by Corollary 4.4(i) applied to H \u2032 and by the fact that e\u2032 \u2208 P \u2032\\P \u20320, we\ninfer that the edge e\u2032 \u03b30-reaches at least\n\u03b14\n2000\n\u0014|V (H \u2032)|\/3\u00152\n\u0007\nother edges of P \u2032 within H \u2032. Therefore, since n > n1, by (4.2) and (4.1), e\u2032 \u03b30-reaches at\nleast |P \u2032\u20320 | + 2|V (H \u2032)| other edges of P \u2032 within H \u2032, where the term 2|V (H \u2032)| takes care of\nall edges adjacent to the two vertices of the set\nTe = V (H\n\u2032) \u2229 V (Qe)\\e\u2032.\nConsequently, there exists at least one edge e\u2032\u2032 \u2208 P \u2032\u2032\\P \u2032\u20320 which is \u03b30-reached from e\u2032\nwithin H \u2032, that is, there are at least \u03b30|V (H \u2032\u2032)| internally disjoint paths from e\u2032 to e\u2032\u2032 of\nlength four in H \u2032. Thus, since n > n1, at least one of them avoids S \u222a Te, and we may\nextend Qe by four vertices, so that the new path Q\n\u2032\ne ends in e\n\u2032\u2032 \u0004\u2208 P \u2032\u20320 .\nWe now similarly extend Qf by four vertices, so that the new path Q\n\u2032\nf is disjoint from Q\n\u2032\ne,\navoids S , and ends in f\u2032\u2032 \u0004\u2208 P \u2032\u20320 . Since H \u2032\u2032 = H \u2032(Q\u2032e, Q\u2032f), and so P \u2032\u20320 = P0(H \u2032(Q\u2032e, Q\u2032f)), the\npair of paths (Q\u2032e, Q\u2032f) satisfies all conditions required in Fact 4.7.\nNow comes the final, gluing part of the proof of Lemma 4.6. First, we have to choose\nthe right length m\u2032 of the paths Qe and Qf guaranteed by Fact 4.7. Since their total length\n178 P. E. Haxell, T. \u0002Luczak, Y. Peng, V. Ro\u00a8dl, A. Rucin\u00b4ski and J. Skokan\n2m\u2032 is divisible by eight, it is convenient to represent m in the form\nm = 8k + h,\nwhere 0 \u0003 h \u0003 7. Note that in view of Claim 4.5, there is nothing to prove when k = 1,\nor k = 2 and h \u0003 1. If k \u0002 2 and h \u0002 2, we need m\u2032 = 4(k \u2212 1) because then m \u2212 2m\u2032 =\n8 + h \u2208 {10, . . . , 15}. Similarly, when k \u0002 3 and h \u0003 1, we need m\u2032 = 4(k \u2212 2) (this time\nm \u2212 2m\u2032 = 16 or 17).\nLet\nTf = V (H\n\u2032) \u2229 V (Qf)\\f\u2032.\nWe connect e\u2032 and f\u2032 by a path Qe\u2032f\u2032 in H \u2032 of length precisely m \u2212 2m\u2032 \u2208 {10, . . . , 17},\nwhich avoids the set S \u222a Te \u222a Tf . This follows from Claim 4.5 above. The concatenation\nQe + Qf + Qe\u2032f\u2032 forms in H an S-avoiding path from e to f of length m, as required.\n5. Proof of Theorem 1.1(b)\nIn Sections 5.1\u20135.4 we prove Theorem 1.1(b) for C (3)3n and then, in Section 5.5, we explain\nhow to adjust the proof to obtain Theorem 1.1(b) in the remaining cases of C (3)3n+1 and\nC\n(3)\n3n+2.\n5.1. The choice of constants and the use of the regularity lemma\nLet \u03b7 > 0 be given. Set \u03b1 = 1\/2 and let \u03b4\u2032, r(\u0007), \u0004(\u0007), n1(\u0007) be as guaranteed by Lemma 4.6.\nLet \u03b4\u2032\u2032 = \u03b4(\u03b7\/2) and s0 = s0(\u03b7\/2) be given by Lemma 2.1. Envisioning an application of\nTheorem 3.2, we set\n\u03b4 = min\n{\n\u03b4\u2032\n2\n,\n\u03b4\u2032\u2032\n40\n}\n, (5.1a)\nt0 = max{\u03b4\u2212100, 5s0}, (5.1b)\nand\nr(t, \u0007) = r(\u0007). (5.1c)\nTheorem 3.2 yields integers L0, T0, N0 from which we derive\nN1 = max\n{\n2T0 max\n\u0007\u0002L0\nn1(\u0007), N0\n}\n.\nNow, for an arbitrary n > 1\n4\nN1, consider a red\u2013blue colouring K\n(3)\nN = Hred \u222a Hblue, where\nN = (4 + \u03b7)n > N1 \u0002 N0.\nWe apply the hypergraph regularity lemma (Theorem 3.2) with parameters given by\n(5.1a)\u2013(5.1c) to Hred (and Hblue), yielding a partition \u03a0 satisfying conditions (i) and (ii) of\nTheorem 3.2. In particular, this determines the values of t and \u0007. Note that |V1| = |V2| =\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = |Vt| > (N \u2212 T0)\/T0 > n1(\u0007).\nBy Claim 3.3, setting \u03b5 = \u03b5(\u0007), there exists a family P of (1\/\u0007, \u03b5)-regular, bipartite graphs\nP ij = P ijaij between pairs (Vi, Vj), where 1 \u0003 i < j \u0003 t, such that Hred (and, by complement,\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 179\nHblue) is (\u03b4, r(t, \u0007))-regular with respect to all but at most 2\u03b4t\n3 triads P ijk = P ij \u222a P jk \u222a P ik .\nSetting r = r(t, \u0007), we will more concisely call these triads (\u03b4, r)-regular.\nNote that if P ijk is a (\u03b4, r)-regular triad then\n(Hred, P\nijk) is a (dHred (P\nijk), \u03b4, \u0007, r, \u03b5)-complex\nand\n(Hblue, P\nijk) is a (dHblue (P\nijk), \u03b4, \u0007, r, \u03b5)-complex.\nMoreover, since\ndHred (P\nijk) + dHblue (P\nijk) = 1, (5.2)\neither dHred (P\nijk) \u0002 1\/2 or dHblue (P ijk) \u0002 1\/2. (This is what we meant in Section 2.4 by a\n\u2018well-structured\u2019 sub-hypergraph.)\n5.2. Finding a monochromatic pseudo-path in K\nWe construct the cluster hypergraph K with the vertex set {1, . . . , t}, and the edge set\nconsisting of all triples {i, j, k} such that the triad P ijk is (\u03b4, r)-regular. Note that K\ncontains at least (\nt\n3\n)\n\u2212 2\u03b4t3 > (1 \u2212 \u03b4\u2032\u2032)\n(\nt\n3\n)\nedges, where the inequality follows by (5.1a).\nWith the ultimate goal of finding a monochromatic cycle C (3)n , we first design a \u2018big\npicture\u2019 route (as a pseudo-path in K) that the monochromatic cycle will eventually follow.\nTo this end, define a red\u2013blue colouring K = Kred \u222a Kblue of the cluster hypergraph K ,\nby including {i, j, k} \u2208 Kred if\ndHred (P\nijk) \u0002 1\/2\nand {i, j, k} \u2208 Kblue otherwise. By (5.2), this colouring is well defined.\nBy Lemma 2.1 with \u03b7\/2 in place of \u03b7, there exists in Kred, say, a connected matching\nM = {h1, . . . , hs} of size s = t\/(4 + \u03b7\/2). Let Qi, i = 1, . . . , s \u2212 1, be a shortest pseudo-path\nin Kred from hi to hi+1. Note that the edges of each Qi are all distinct, and thus the length\n\u0007i of Qi satisfies the bound \u0007i \u0003\n(\nt\n3\n)\n, which is independent of n.\nGiven two pseudo-paths P and Q, where the last edge of P coincides with the first edge\nof Q, P + Q stands for the concatenation of P and Q. The pseudo-path\nQ = Q1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + Qs\u22121 = (e1, . . . , ep)\nwill serve as a \u2018frame\u2019 for the long red cycle in Hred.\n5.3. Creating a short monochromatic cycle in H\nFor every i = 1, . . . , p, let P i = P ei be the triad corresponding to a cluster edge ei. Recall\nthat all these triads are (\u03b4, r)-regular. Let P i0 \u2282 P i be the subgraph of P i (of prohibited\nedges) given by Lemma 4.6 applied to the complex (Hred, P\ni), and, for i = 1, . . . , p \u2212 1, set\nBi = (P i\\P i0) \u2229 (P i+1\\P i+10 ).\n180 P.

The bound on |P i0| from\nLemma 4.6 ensures that for sufficiently large n this is possible.\nIn the next step of our construction, applying repeatedly Claim 4.5, we create a short\ncycle C in Hred of length divisible by 3. To this end, we connect, by disjoint paths of length\n10, 11, or 12, f1 to f2 to f3 . . . to fp\u22121 to gp\u22121 and then, \u2018backwards\u2019, gp\u22121 to gp\u22122 . . . to g1\nto f1.\nFor the passages from fp\u22121 to gp\u22121 and from g1 to f1, we choose the triads Pp and P 1,\nrespectively, while for all i = 1, . . . , p \u2212 2, the paths from fi to fi+1 and from gi+1 to gi use\nthe triad P i+1.\nWe have a choice of the direction around P 2 in which we connect f1 to f2, but then\nall other directions are determined. For the types to be well defined (cf. Definition 4.1),\nwe need to designate one orientation around each triad as canonical. For convenience,\nwe declare as canonical the orientation consistent with the direction in which our paths\nproceed.\nNote that for each i = 1, . . . , p \u2212 2, the paths from fi to fi+1 and from gi+1 to gi go in\nthe same, now canonical, direction around P i+1. Hence,\ntype(fi, fi+1) + type(gi+1, gi) = 1 + 2 = 0 (mod 3). (5.3)\nSince also\ntype(g1, f1) = type(fp\u22121, gp\u22121) = 0 (mod 3),\nthe obtained short cycle C has length divisible by 3.\nTo keep the paths disjoint, we apply Claim 4.5 with the set S collecting the vertices\nof the so far constructed paths. Since |S | \u0003 12(2p) < n\/ log n, the assumptions on the size\nof S in Claim 4.5 are satisfied. For future reference, we let R1 denote the just-created short\npath from g1 to f1, by Ri+1, i = 1, . . . , p \u2212 2, the paths from fi to fi+1, and by Rp the path\nfrom fp\u22121 to gp\u22121.\n5.4. Creating a monochromatic cycle of length 3n\nPreparing for the final step, let\nI = {1, \u00071, \u00071 + \u00072 \u2212 1, . . . , p}.\nObserve that |I | = s and that M = {h1, . . . , hs} = {ei : i \u2208 I}.\nTo complete the proof, we replace the short paths Ri, i \u2208 I , in C by disjoint, long paths\nwith the same endpairs as the Ris, which lie in the same triads (and thus, have the same\nlength modulo 3 as the Ris), in such a way that the total length of the obtained cycle is\n3n.\nSpecifically, let m\u2032 be the length of C , minus the sum of the lengths of all paths Rj with\nj \u2208 I . Furthermore, for each i \u2208 I , i \u0004= p, let\nmi =\n\u230a\n3n \u2212 m\u2032\ns\n\u230b\n+ xi,\nwhere xi = 0, 1, or 2, so that\nmi \u2212 type(fi, fi+1) = 0 (mod 3).\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 181\nFor each i \u2208 I , i \u0004= 1, p, we apply Lemma 4.6 to the complex (Hred, P i+1), with e = fi,\nf = fi+1, S = V (C)\\(e \u222a f) (note that |S | = O(1)), and with m = mi. As a result, we obtain\npaths Ti from fi to fi+1 of length mi, i \u2208 I , i \u0004= 1, p, and, similarly, a path T1 from f1 to g1\nof length m1. To achieve precisely the length 3n for the final cycle, we take a path Tp\nfrom fp\u22121 to gp\u22121 of length\nmp = 3n \u2212\n(\nm\u2032 +\n\u2211\ni\u2208I\\{p}\nmi\n)\n.\nThis is possible, because for large n\n10 \u0003 mp \u0003\n3n\ns\n+ O(1) \u0003 (1 \u2212 \u03b41\/4)3\n\u230a\nN\nt\n\u230b\n,\nand Lemma 4.6 can again be applied. Since the edges of M are vertex-disjoint, the paths\nTi do not interfere with each other.\n5.5. Adjustment to lengths 3n+ 1 and 3n+ 2\nIn order to prove the second part of Theorem 1.1(b), we first choose the constants in the\nsame way as in Section 5.1, then apply the hypergraph regularity lemma (Theorem 3.2)\nto the red\u2013blue coloured K(6+\u03b7)n = Hred \u222a Hblue, from which we obtain the cluster hyper-\ngraph K .\nNext, we colour the edges of K with red and blue as in Section 5.2 and then use\nLemma 2.2 to find, say, in Kred a connected union of a matching M = {h1, . . . , hs} of\nsize s = t\/(6 + \u03b7\/2) and a copy D of C (3)4 or C\n(3)\n5 . Below we consider only the case when\nD = C (3)4 , leaving the other case to the reader.\nWe use the approach from Section 5.3 to obtain a red copy of C (3)3n+1 [or C\n(3)\n3n+2]. As\nbefore, let Qi, i = 1, . . . , s \u2212 1, be a shortest red pseudo-path from hi to hi+1, and, in\naddition, let Qs be the shortest red pseudo-path from hs to an edge of D. The pseudo-path\nQ = Q1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + Qs = (e1, . . . , ep)\nwill now serve as a frame for the desired red cycle in Hred.\nWe define P i, P i0, B\ni and mutually distinct edges fi, gi \u2208 Bi for 1 \u0003 i \u0003 p \u2212 1 as before.\nRelying on Claim 4.5, we first construct the short paths as before, except that now the\npath Rp from fp\u22121 to gp\u22121 has to be of length equal to 1 [or 2] modulo 3. To ensure this,\nwe build Rp out of 4 pieces, one in each triad constituting D, each piece connecting a pair\nof edges of type 1 [or 2].\nMore specifically, let V (D) = {a, b, c, d}, where ep = {a, b, c} and {a, b} \u2282 ep\u22121. Let us\nchoose disjoint, typical (that is, not belonging to respective prohibited subgraphs Pxyz0 )\nedges from the intersections of consecutive triads: fbc \u2208 Pabc \u2229 Pbcd, fcd \u2208 Pbcd \u2229 P cda, and\nfda \u2208 P cda \u2229 Pdab.\nBy Claim 4.5, going around each triad alphabetically, there are internally disjoint paths\nof length 10, connecting fp\u22121 to fbc to fcd to fda to gp\u22121. This settles the case i = 1. For\ni = 2, we build paths of length 11, connecting fp\u22121 to fda to fcd to fbc to gp\u22121.\nFinally, using Lemma 4.6, some s paths Ri, corresponding to the edges of M, are\nreplaced by long paths Ti, in exactly the same way as in Section 5.4. Of course, we now\n182 P. E. Haxell, T. \u0002Luczak, Y. Peng, V. Ro\u00a8dl, A. Rucin\u00b4ski and J. Skokan\nadjust the length of the last path, so that the length of the resulting cycle is exactly 3n+ 1\n[or 3n+ 2].\n6. Matchings in components (idealized)\nIn this section we prove a version of Lemma 2.1 with \u03b7 = \u03b4 = 0. There are two reasons\nfor doing this. Firstly, we exhibit here all essential ingredients of the real proof given\nin Section 8, not hidden under the burden of tedious estimations. Secondly, the result\nwe present here is interesting in its own right, as dealing with a \u2018connected\u2019 version of\nthe classical Ramsey number r(M(3)s ) = 4s \u2212 1. It turns out that this Ramsey number\nis not affected by the additional restriction that the matching must be contained in\na monochromatic component. Interestingly, besides the extremal colouring of K (3)4s\u22122\ndescribed in the proof of Theorem 1.1(a), which prevents any monochromatic matching\nof size s, there is another one which contains monochromatic matchings of size s, but not\nexternally connected (see Example 1 in Section 2.2).\nTheorem 6.1. In every red\u2013blue colouring of the complete 3-uniform hypergraph K (3)4s\u22121 =\nKred \u222a Kblue, either Kred or Kblue contains an externally connected matching M(3)s .\nThe connectedness and components of a hypergraph H were defined in Section 2.2.\nDenote by \u2202H the set of all pairs xy for which there exists z such that xyz \u2208 H (\u2202H is\nusually referred to as the shadow of H). We find it convenient to view \u2202H as both a graph\nand a set of pairs of the vertices of H . Observe that\n\u2202H \u2032 \u2229 \u2202H \u2032\u2032 = \u2205 for any two distinct components H \u2032, H \u2032\u2032 of H . (6.4)\nIn particular, any two edges of the same colour (say red), sharing two vertices must be in\nthe same red component.\nSet t = 4s \u2212 1, K = K (3)t , V = V (K), and consider an arbitrary red\u2013blue colouring\nK = Kred \u222a Kblue. Our goal is to find M(3)s in some component of Kred or Kblue. We start\nour proof with two observations.\nObservation 6.2. For every x \u2208 V there exists a monochromatic component C such that\n{xy : y \u2208 V\\{x}} \u2286 \u2202C .\nProof. Let Kred(x) := {yz : xyz \u2208 Kred} and Kblue(x) := {yz : xyz \u2208 Kblue}. Since every\nedge of K is coloured by only one colour, Kblue(x) is the complement of Kred(x),\nand consequently, one of these two graphs must be connected. Suppose that Kred(x) is\nconnected. Then, for every two vertices y, z \u2208 V\\{x} there is a path y = x1, x2, . . . , xk = z\nin Kred(x) which corresponds to a red pseudo-path e1, e2, . . . , ek\u22121, where ei = xxixi+1,\ni = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1. This pseudo-path connects xy with xz in Kred, and hence, there is a red\ncomponent C such that xy, xz \u2208 \u2202C .\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 183\nFor each x \u2208 V let us choose arbitrarily one component satisfying the condition in\nObservation 6.2 and denote it by Cx. Let Vred = {x \u2208 V : Cx is red} and Vblue = {x \u2208\nV : Cx is blue}. Note that V = Vred \u222a Vblue and these two sets are disjoint.\nObservation 6.3. If Vred \u0004= \u2205 (Vblue \u0004= \u2205, respectively), then there is a red component S (a\nblue component A) such that Cx = S for every x \u2208 Vred (Cx = A for every x \u2208 Vblue).\nProof. This observation is trivial if |Vred| = 1. Suppose |Vred| \u0002 2 and let x, x\u2032 \u2208 Vred.\nThen xx\u2032 \u2208 \u2202Cx \u2229 \u2202Cx\u2032 , and, by (6.4), we have Cx = Cx\u2032 .\nComponents A and S will play a special role, and we will refer to them as azure (A)\nand scarlet (S).\nThe next two claims form a mechanism to build an externally connected matching in\none colour given an externally connected matching of the same size in the other colour\n(Lemma 6.7). Clearly, the colours in their statements can be interchanged.\nClaim 6.4. Let X = {x, y, z, a, b, c, d} \u2282 V be a set of seven vertices. Suppose that xyz is an\nedge of some red component Cred and ya, zb \u2208 \u2202Cblue for some blue component Cblue. Then\nat least one of the following holds.\n(1) X contains two disjoint edges of Cred.\n(2) There is an edge e \u2282 X in Cblue such that |e \u2229 {a, b, c}| = 1 and |e \u2229 {x, y, z}| = 2.\n(3) X contains two disjoint edges of Cblue.\nProof. Suppose that neither (1) nor (2) holds. Then both xya \u2208 Cred and xzb \u2208 Cred, and,\nconsequently, ya, zb \u2208 \u2202Cred. Thus, if zbc or yad were red, they would belong to Cred. Since\nxya \u2208 Cred, this implies that the edge zbc has to be blue, and thus zbc \u2208 Cblue (because\nzb \u2208 \u2202Cblue). Similarly, since xzb \u2208 Cred, the edge yad has to be blue, and thus yad \u2208 Cblue\n(because ya \u2208 \u2202Cblue), yielding (3).\nClaim 6.5. Let X = {u, v, w, x, y, z, a, b, c} \u2282 V be a set of nine vertices. Suppose that uvw\nand xyz are edges of some red component Cred and ya, zb, vb, wc \u2208 \u2202Cblue for some blue\ncomponent Cblue. Then at least one of the following holds.\n(1) X contains three disjoint edges of Cred.\n(2) There is an edge e in Cblue such that |e \u2229 {a, b, c}| = 1 and either |e \u2229 {x, y, z}| = 2, or\n|e \u2229 {u, v, w}| = 2.\n(3) There are two disjoint edges in Cblue such that both of them intersect each of {x, y, z},\n{u, v, w}, and {a, b, c} in one vertex.\nProof. If (2) does not hold, then the edges xzb, vwc, uwc and yza are all red (because\nya, zb, wc \u2208 \u2202Cblue), and thus in Cred (because xyz, uvw \u2208 Cred). Consider the edges yua\nand xvb. If either of them is red, then it has to be in Cred (because ya, xb \u2208 \u2202Cred),\nyielding (1), as xzb, vwc, and yua are disjoint and in Cred, and so are uwc, yza and xvb. If\nboth yua and xvb are blue, then they belong to Cblue (because ya, vb \u2208 \u2202Cblue). Hence (3)\nholds.\n184 P. E. Haxell, T. \u0002Luczak, Y. Peng, V. Ro\u00a8dl, A. Rucin\u00b4ski and J. Skokan\nRemark 6.6. Note that for the proofs of Claims 6.4 and 6.5 it is not essential that K is a\ncomplete hypergraph. In the case of Claim 6.4, we just need to assume that all triples of\nvertices within X, intersecting simultaneously {x, y, z} and {a, b, c, d}, are edges of K . In\nthe case of Claim 6.5, all triples of vertices within X, having two vertices in {u, v, w, x, y, z}\nand one in {a, b, c}, must be edges of K . This observation will be used in the full proof of\nLemma 2.1 in Section 8.\nOur last preliminary result relies heavily on the two previous claims. Essentially, it says\nthat given a maximal matching in a red component, one can construct a matching in a\nblue component of roughly the same size.\nLemma 6.7 (The Mirror Lemma). Let M be a largest matching in a red component Cred\nand let P be a set of at least |M| + 3 vertices outside M. Assume further that for some blue\ncomponent Cblue and for every e \u2208 M, the bipartite induced subgraph \u2202Cblue[e, P ] of \u2202Cblue\ncontains K2,|P |\u22121. Moreover, setting G = \u2202Cblue[V (M), P ], let J be an arbitrary, non-empty\nsubset of P such that\nJ \u2287 {v \u2208 P : degG(v) < |V (M)|}.\nThen there exists a matching M \u2032 \u2282 Cblue such that either\n(i) |M \u2032| = |M|,\n(ii) |V (M \u2032) \u2229 P | \u0003 |M|, and\n(iii) (P\\V (M \u2032)) \u2229 J \u0004= \u2205,\nor\n(iv) |M \u2032| = |M| + 1, and\n(v) |V (M \u2032) \u2229 P | \u0003 |M| + 3.\nProof. Let M \u2032\u2032 \u2282 Cblue be a largest matching such that:\n\u2022 |V (M \u2032\u2032) \u2229 P | \u0003 |M \u2032\u2032|,\n\u2022 V (M \u2032\u2032) intersects at most |M \u2032\u2032| edges of M,\n\u2022 (P\\V (M \u2032\u2032)) \u2229 J \u0004= \u2205.\n(6.2)\nWe claim that |M \u2032\u2032| \u0002 |M| \u2212 1. Indeed, suppose |M \u2032\u2032| \u0003 |M| \u2212 2. It follows that there exist\ne1, e2 \u2208 M so that (e1 \u222a e2) \u2229 V (M \u2032\u2032) = \u2205. Set P \u2032\u2032 = P\\V (M \u2032\u2032). Since\n|P \u2032\u2032| = |P | \u2212 |P \u2229 V (M \u2032\u2032)| \u0002 |M| + 3 \u2212 (|M| \u2212 2) = 5,\none can choose a, b, c \u2208 P \u2032\u2032 so that \u2202Cblue[ei, {a, b, c}] \u2283 K2,3 for i = 1, 2, and (P \u2032\u2032\\{a, b, c}) \u2229\nJ \u0004= \u2205. This is always possible because, for each e1 and e2, at most one vertex of P can\nbe excluded from the copy of K2,|P |\u22121 guaranteed by the assumptions, and these excluded\nvertices must belong to J . (If no vertex is excluded, then we can simply choose a, b, and\nc so that a vertex of J remains in P \u2032\u2032\\{a, b, c}.)\nClaim 6.5, applied to X = e1 \u222a e2 \u222a {a, b, c}, implies that we can either enlarge M in Cred\n(if (1) of Claim 6.5 occurs) or M \u2032\u2032 in Cblue with conditions (6.2) preserved (if (2) or (3) of\nClaim 6.5 occurs), yielding a contradiction with the choice of M or M \u2032\u2032, respectively.\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 185\nHence |M \u2032\u2032| \u0002 |M| \u2212 1. If |M \u2032\u2032| \u0002 |M|, we are done. Otherwise, let xyz \u2208 M be such that\n{x, y, z} \u2229 V (M \u2032\u2032) = \u2205. Since\n|P \u2032\u2032| \u0002 |M| + 3 \u2212 (|M| \u2212 1) = 4,\none can choose a, b, c \u2208 P \u2032\u2032 so that \u2202Cblue[e, {a, b, c}] \u2283 K2,3 and (P \u2032\u2032\\{a, b, c}) \u2229 J \u0004= \u2205. We\napply Claim 6.4 to the set X = {x, y, z, a, b, c, d}, where d \u2208 P \u2032\u2032\\{a, b, c} is arbitrary. By\nthe maximality of M in Cred, (1) cannot hold. If (2) holds, we enlarge M\n\u2032\u2032 by adding the\nedge e, obtaining a matching M \u2032 satisfying conditions (i), (ii), and (iii). If conclusion (3)\nholds, we enlarge M \u2032\u2032 by adding two disjoint edges, obtaining a matching M \u2032 satisfying\nconditions (iv) and (v).\nProof of Theorem 6.1. Let M be a largest matching among all matchings contained in S\nor A. Without loss of generality we assume that \u2205 \u0004= M \u2282 S . This implies that Vred \u0004= \u2205,\nbut Vblue might be empty. Suppose that\n1 \u0003 m = |M| \u0003 s \u2212 1 (6.3)\nand set\nR = Vred\\V (M) and B = Vblue\\V (M). (6.4)\nNote that R \u2229 B = \u2205,\nt = 4s \u2212 1 = 3m+ |R \u222a B|, (6.5)\nand consequently, using also (6.3),\n|R \u222a B| = 4s \u2212 1 \u2212 3m \u0002 s+ 2 \u0002 m+ 3 \u0002 4. (6.6)\nObservation 6.8. All edges in R \u222a B with at least one vertex in R are blue, and therefore\nin the same blue component Cblue. Furthermore, if B \u0004= \u2205, then Cblue = A.\nProof. Note that any red edge with at least one vertex in R is in the scarlet component\nS and, if disjoint from V (M), could be used to enlarge M. Hence, all edges from the\nset T = {e \u2282 R \u222a B : e \u2229 R \u0004= \u2205} must be blue. Moreover, every pair of edges from T is\nconnected by a pseudo-path in T , and thus, they all belong to the same blue component.\nThe second part follows because any blue edge containing a vertex from Vblue also contains\na pair from A (see Observation 6.3).\nFor the rest of the proof we distinguish three cases. In each of them, the Mirror Lemma\nplays a central role. However, we need its technical conclusion (iii) only in the third case.\nCase 1. B = \u2205.\nIn this case, R \u222a V (M) = V and thus |R| = t \u2212 3m \u0002 m+ 3 \u0002 4. Denote by Cblue the\nblue component guaranteed by Observation 6.8.\nObservation 6.9. For every edge e \u2208 M, the bipartite induced subgraph \u2202Cblue[e, R] of \u2202Cblue\ncontains K2,|R|\u22121 as a subgraph.\n186 P. E. Haxell, T. \u0002Luczak, Y. Peng, V. Ro\u00a8dl, A. Rucin\u00b4ski and J. Skokan\nProof. Suppose there is an edge xyz \u2208 M and two vertices a, b \u2208 R such that xa and\nyb \u0004\u2208 \u2202Cblue. Let c, d \u2208 R\\{a, b} (recall that |R| \u0002 4). Note that, by Observation 6.8, ac, bd \u2208\n\u2202Cblue, and thus edges xac and ybd must be red.\nSince ax, by \u2208 \u2202S , we have that xac, ybd \u2208 S . Consequently, (M\\{xyz}) \u222a {xac, ybd} is a\nred matching in S larger than M \u2013 a contradiction.\nNow we apply Lemma 6.7 with P = R (recall that |R| \u0002 m+ 3), obtaining a matching\nM \u2032 \u2282 Cblue either of size m and with |V (M \u2032) \u2229 R| \u0003 m, or of size m+ 1 and with |V (M \u2032) \u2229\nR| \u0003 m+ 3. Note that by (6.3)\n|R\\V (M \u2032)| \u0002\n{\n4s \u2212 1 \u2212 3m \u2212 m \u0002 3(s \u2212 m) in the former case,\n4s \u2212 1 \u2212 3m \u2212 (m+ 3) \u0002 3(s \u2212 m \u2212 1) in the latter case.\nThis allows us in either case to enlarge M \u2032 to size s. Indeed, since all edges contained in R\nare in Cblue (cf. Observation 6.8), we can greedily find s \u2212 m or s \u2212 m \u2212 1, respectively,\ndisjoint edges from Cblue and add them to M\n\u2032.\nCase 2. R = \u2205.\nIn this case, B \u222a V (M) = V and thus |B| = t \u2212 3m \u0002 m+ 3 \u0002 4. Since B \u0004= \u2205, the azure\ncomponent A exists. Furthermore, by the definition of Vblue and (6.4), we know that\nfor every e \u2208 M the bipartite subgraph \u2202A[e, B] of \u2202A is complete. Thus, by the Mirror\nLemma applied with P = B, we obtain a matching M \u2032 \u2282 A of size |M \u2032| = m and such\nthat |V (M \u2032) \u2229 B| \u0003 m. (A matching of size m+ 1 in the azure component A is impossible\nby our choice of M.)\nNote that |B\\V (M \u2032)| \u0002 4s \u2212 1 \u2212 3m \u2212 m \u0002 3. We claim that R\u2032 := Vred\\V (M \u2032) = \u2205.\nIndeed, suppose that R\u2032 \u0004= \u2205. Take any three vertices a, b, c \u2208 B\\V (M \u2032) and d \u2208 R\u2032 (observe\nthat d \u0004\u2208 B\\V (M \u2032) because R\u2032 \u2282 Vred in this case). Since ab \u2208 \u2202A (because a \u2208 Vblue), both\nabc and abd are red (otherwise we could enlarge M \u2032 to size m+ 1). But ad \u2208 \u2202S (because\nd \u2208 Vred), therefore abd \u2208 S and, consequently, abc \u2208 S . Since {a, b, c} \u2229 V (M) = \u2205, we can\nenlarge M, which is a contradiction.\nThus R\u2032 = \u2205 and we are back in Case 1 with the colours red and blue interchanged and\nM replaced by M \u2032.\nCase 3. |B|, |R| \u0002 1.\nSet P = R \u222a B and note that, by (6.6), we have |P | \u0002 m+ 3. Since B \u0004= \u2205, the blue\ncomponent guaranteed by Observation 6.8 is Cblue = A. In particular, for all pairs of\nvertices a, b \u2208 P we have ab \u2208 \u2202A.\nObservation 6.10. For every e \u2208 M, the bipartite induced subgraph \u2202A[e, P ] of \u2202A contains\nK2,|P |\u22121 as a subgraph.\nProof. The proof follows the lines of the proof of Observation 6.9. Suppose there is an\nedge xyz \u2208 M and two vertices a, b \u2208 P such that xa, yb \u0004\u2208 \u2202A. Note that, in fact, a, b \u2208 R\nbecause \u2202A[e, B] is the complete bipartite graph. Recall that |P | \u0002 4 by (6.6), and choose\narbitrarily c, d \u2208 P\\{a, b}. Since ac, bd \u2208 \u2202A, edges xac and ybd must be red.\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 187\nOn the other hand, by the definition of Vred, we also have ax, by \u2208 \u2202S , so xac, ybd \u2208 S .\nHence, (M\\{xyz}) \u222a {xac, ybd} is a red matching in S larger than M \u2013 a contradic-\ntion.\nWe apply the Mirror Lemma with Cred = S , Cblue = A, P = R \u222a B, and J = R. Let M \u2032\nbe a matching in A satisfying conclusions (i)\u2013(iii) (again, option (iv)\u2013(v) is excluded by\nthe choice of M). We have\n|P\\V (M \u2032)| \u0002 4s \u2212 1 \u2212 3m \u2212 m \u0002 3.\nBy conclusion (iii), we can choose a, b, c \u2208 P\\V (M \u2032) so that c \u2208 R. Hence, the pair ac \u2208 \u2202S .\nAlso, recall that ac \u2208 \u2202A. So abc \u2208 S if it is red and abc \u2208 A if it is blue. Since {a, b, c} is\ndisjoint from both V (M) and V (M \u2032), we obtain either a matching of size |M| + 1 in S or\na matching of size |M \u2032| + 1 = |M| + 1 in A. Either case contradicts the maximality of M\namong all matchings contained in S or A.\n7. Matchings and short cycles in components (idealized)\nIn this section we prove a version of Lemma 2.2 with \u03b4 = 0, and with the term \u03b7s replaced\nby \u03a9(\n\u221a\ns). The main reason for doing this is, similarly to the previous section, to show the\nideas of the proof clearly and without tiring calculations. A complete proof of Lemma 2.2\nis not included in this paper, but can be found in [12].\nTheorem 7.1. There exists c0 such that the following holds. Let s \u0002 c20 and let K be the\ncomplete 3-uniform hypergraph with t \u0002 6s+ c0\n\u221a\ns vertices. Then, for every red\u2013blue col-\nouring K = Kred \u222a Kblue, either Kred or Kblue contains an externally connected union of a\nmatching M(3)s and a cycle C\n(3)\n4 or C\n(3)\n5 .\nPlease note that the above theorem determines only the asymptotic value of the Ramsey\nnumber for a connected union of a matching M(3)s of size s and a copy of C\n(3)\n4 or C\n(3)\n5\n(we do not require them to be disjoint). At this point we do not know whether the lower\nbound of 6s+ 2i \u2212 1 given in Sections 2.1 and 2.3 is optimal.\nProof. Let c0 = 25\n\u221a\n7, s \u0002 c20, and let K be the complete 3-uniform hypergraph with\nt = 6s+ c0\n\u221a\ns vertices. For simplicity, we assume that 6s+ c0\n\u221a\ns is an integer and note\nthat t \u0003 7s. Suppose that for an arbitrary red\u2013blue colouring K = Kred \u222a Kblue\nno monochromatic component contains M(3)s and C\n(3)\n4 or C\n(3)\n5 . (7.1)\nRecall that the sets Vred and Vblue, and the scarlet component S and the azure component\nA were defined in Section 6. We distinguish two complementary cases, and in each of\nthem we obtain a contradiction to (7.1) or its consequence, (7.2) below. In each case we\nuse the fact that r(C (3)4 ) = 13 (see [16]).\nCase 1. |Vred|, |Vblue| \u0002 s.\nIn this case we are able to prove Theorem 7.1 even with t = 6s \u2212 1 and s \u0002 37. We first\nprove that each of S and A contains a matching M(3)s .\n188 P. E. Haxell, T. \u0002Luczak, Y. Peng, V. Ro\u00a8dl, A. Rucin\u00b4ski and J. Skokan\nObservation 7.2. M(3)s \u2282 A and M(3)s \u2282 S .\nProof. Partition the set of vertices V (K) := V into sets V \u2032, V \u2032red, V \u2032blue such that V \u2032red \u2282\nVred, |V \u2032red| = s, V \u2032blue \u2282 Vblue, |V \u2032blue| = s, and V \u2032 = V\\(V \u2032red \u222a V \u2032blue).\nSince |V \u2032| \u0002 6s \u2212 1 \u2212 2s \u0002 4s \u2212 1, Theorem 6.1 applied to the induced red\u2013blue col-\nouring Kred[V\n\u2032] \u222a Kblue[V \u2032] of K[V \u2032] implies that there exists a matching M = M(3)s in\na component (say red) Cred of Kred. (This is true because each component of any sub-\nhypergraph of Kred is contained in some component of Kred.)\nBy (7.1) we know that C (3)4 \u0004\u2282 Cred. Consequently, for each edge xyz \u2208 M and any vertex\na \u2208 V \u2032blue, at least one of the edges xya, xza, yza must be blue and also in A, since a \u2208 V \u2032blue.\nThus, using all s vertices of V \u2032blue and s edges of M, we greedily find a matching of size s\nin A. Using (7.1) again, we have C (3)4 \u0004\u2282 A. Replacing Cred with A, Vblue with V \u2032red, A with\nS , and interchanging colours red and blue in the argument above, we obtain a matching\nof size s in S .\nIn view of Observation 7.2, it follows from (7.1) that\nC\n(3)\n4 \u0004\u2282 A and C (3)4 \u0004\u2282 S. (7.2)\nObservation 7.3. For every pair of vertices xy \u2208 (Vred\n2\n)\nthere exist at most twelve vertices\nz \u2208 Vblue such that xyz is blue (and therefore in A).\nProof. Suppose there is a pair xy \u2208 (Vred\n2\n)\nand 13 vertices z1, . . . , z13 \u2208 Vblue so that\nxyzi \u2208 A for i = 1, 2, . . . , 13. Since r(C (3)4 ) = 13, the sub-hypergraph induced in K by\nz1, . . . , z13 contains a monochromatic copy C of C (3)4 .\nOn the one hand, all pairs zizj are in \u2202A, because zi, zj \u2208 Vblue. Therefore, if C was blue\nthen C \u2282 A \u2013 a contradiction to (7.2). On the other hand, all edges xyz, where z \u2208 V (C),\nare in A by our assumption. In order to avoid a copy of C (3)4 in A, one of the edges xzz\n\u2032,\nyzz\u2032, where z, z\u2032 \u2208 V (C), must be red. Since x, y \u2208 Vred, such an edge is in S , and we have\nzz\u2032 \u2208 \u2202S . Hence, if C was red, then C \u2282 S \u2013 again a contradiction to (7.2).\nObservation 7.4. Every triple of vertices in Vred is blue and, consequently,\n(\nVred\n3\n) \u2282 C \u2032blue for\nsome blue component C \u2032blue.\nProof. By Observation 7.3, for all x, y, z \u2208 Vred, there are at most 3 \u00d7 12 vertices a \u2208 Vblue\nso that one of the edges xya, xza, yza is blue. Since |Vblue| \u0002 s \u0002 37, we can select a vertex\na \u2208 Vblue so that xya, xza, yza \u2208 S . We must have xyz blue to avoid C (3)4 in S .\nWe can clearly interchange colours red and blue in Observations 7.3 and 7.4 and obtain\nthat\n(\nVblue\n3\n) \u2282 C \u2032red for some red component C \u2032red. Since one of Vred, Vblue must contain at\nleast \u0012t\/2\u0013 \u0002 3s vertices, we find greedily both a copy of M(3)s and a copy of C (3)4 , in either\nC \u2032red or C \u2032blue, contradicting (7.1).\nCase 2. |Vred| < s or |Vblue| < s.\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 189\nBy symmetry, we may assume that |Vred| < s and |Vblue| > 5s+ c0\u221as. We first prove\nthat the azure component A contains a matching M(3)s whose vertex set is in Vblue. Again,\nthis is true even for t = 6s \u2212 2.\nObservation 7.5. There exists a matching MA = M\n(3)\ns \u2282 A with V (MA) \u2282 Vblue.\nProof. Let Vblue = V\n\u2032 \u222a V \u2032\u2032 be a partition of Vblue such that |V \u2032| = s. Since |V \u2032\u2032| \u0002 6s \u2212 2 \u2212\n(s \u2212 1) \u2212 s \u0002 4s \u2212 1, Theorem 6.1 applied to the induced 2-colouring Kred[V \u2032\u2032] \u222a Kblue[V \u2032\u2032]\nof K[V \u2032\u2032] implies that there exists a matching M = M(3)s in a monochromatic component\nof K[V \u2032\u2032] (which is contained in some monochromatic component C in K).\nIf C is blue, then it must be A, because V \u2032\u2032 is a subset of Vblue, and we are done.\nHence assume C = Cred is red. By (7.1), we have C\n(3)\n4 \u0004\u2282 Cred. To avoid C (3)4 in Cred, for\neach edge xyz \u2208 M and any vertex a \u2208 V \u2032, at least one of the edges xya, xza, yza must\nbe a blue edge, and, consequently, also in A, because a \u2208 V \u2032 \u2282 Vblue. Thus, using all s\nvertices a \u2208 V \u2032 and s edges of M, we greedily find a matching MA of size s in A. Clearly,\nV (MA) \u2282 V \u2032 \u222a V \u2032\u2032 = Vblue.\nIn view of Observation 7.5 and the assumption (7.1), we know that\nC\n(3)\n4 \u0004\u2282 A. (7.3)\nWe distinguish two subcases. In the first one we assume that almost all pairs of vertices\nfrom Vblue are contained in the shadows of at most two red components.\nSubcase 2a. There exist two red components C1red and C\n2\nred such that\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n(\nVblue\n2\n)\n\\(\u2202C1red \u222a \u2202C2red)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 < 6t. (7.4)\nWe now prove a series of observations. Recall that by Observation 6.3 the scarlet\ncomponent S exists whenever Vred \u0004= \u2205. We now show that in that case one of C1red and\nC2red equals S or can be replaced by S .\nObservation 7.6. If Vred \u0004= \u2205, then there exists a red component Cred such that\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n(\nVblue\n2\n)\n\\(\u2202Cred \u222a \u2202S)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n(\nV\n2\n)\n\\(\u2202Cred \u222a \u2202S)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 < 24t. (7.5)\nProof. Note that\n(\nV\n2\n)\\(Vblue\n2\n) \u2282 \u2202S . If |\u2202C1red| \u0003 18t holds, then with Cred = C2red we have\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n(\nV\n2\n)\n\\(\u2202Cred \u222a \u2202S)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 (7.4)< 6t+ |\u2202C1red| \u0003 24t.\nHence, suppose that |\u2202C1red| > 18t and |\u2202C2red| > 18t. We claim that there exist vertices\nu, v, w \u2208 Vblue such that uv \u2208 \u2202C1red, uw \u2208 \u2202C2red, and vw \u2208 \u2202C1red \u222a \u2202C2red.\nThis follows from a simple graph-theoretic fact.\n190 P. E. Haxell, T. \u0002Luczak, Y. Peng, V. Ro\u00a8dl, A. Rucin\u00b4ski and J. Skokan\nFact 7.7. Let the edges of the complete graph Kn be partitioned into three sets E1, E2, E3\nso that, with ei = |Ei|, i = 1, 2, 3, we have min{e1, e2} > 3e3. Then there exists a triangle\nwith at least one edge in E1, at least one edge in E2 and no edge in E3.\nProof. Since the average degree in E3 is 2e3\/n, there is a vertex u such that degE3 (u) \u0003\n2e3\/n. If degE1 (u), degE2 (u) >\n\u221a\ne3, then there is a non-E3 edge between the neighbourhoods\nNE1 (u) and NE2 (u), completing a desired triangle.\nSuppose now that, say, degE1 (u) \u0003\n\u221a\ne3. If there is an edge xy \u2208 E1 with x \u2208 NE1 (u) and\ny \u2208 NE2 (u), then u, x, y is the desired triangle. Otherwise, the number of edges of E1 not\ncontained in NE2 (u) is at most\ndegE1 (u) +\n(\ndegE1 (u)\n2\n)\n+ degE3 (u) \u00d7 n \u0003\n1\n2\n(\n\u221a\ne3 + e3) + 2e3 < 3e3 < e1.\nHence, there is an edge of E1 with both endpoints in NE2 (u), yielding again a desired\ntriangle.\nWe apply Fact 7.7 to E1 := \u2202C\n1\nred, E2 := \u2202C\n2\nred and E3 :=\n(\nVblue\n2\n)\\(\u2202C1red \u222a \u2202C2red) (note\nthat the assumptions hold).\nTake any x \u2208 Vred and vertices u, v, w \u2208 Vblue such that uv \u2208 \u2202C1red, uw \u2208 \u2202C2red, and\nvw \u2208 \u2202C1red \u222a \u2202C2red. Since all three pairs of vertices contained in any red edge are in the\nshadow of the same red component, uvw must be a blue edge and hence in A. To avoid\na copy of C (3)4 in A, at least one of the edges uvx, uwx, vwx must be a red edge, say uvx.\nSince uv \u2208 \u2202C1red and xu \u2208 \u2202S , we have C1red = S and the proof is completed by setting\nCred = C\n2\nred and recalling (7.4).\nFrom now on we assume that\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n(\nVblue\n2\n)\n\\(\u2202C1red \u222a \u2202C2red)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 < 24t, (7.6)\nand that C1red = S , if S exists.\nObservation 7.8. Every set X \u2282 Vblue with |X| \u0002 25\u221at contains a copy of C (3)4 in C1red or\nC2red.\nProof. Let X \u2282 Vblue with |X| \u0002 25\u221at be given. Note that by (7.6)\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223(\u2202C1red \u222a \u2202C2red) \u2229\n(\nX\n2\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u0002\n(|X|\n2\n)\n\u2212 24t > 11\n24\n|X|2.\nThus, by the Tura\u00b4n Theorem, there is a complete graph K13 in \u2202C\n1\nred \u222a \u2202C2red. Let X0 be the\nvertex set of one such K13. Since r(C\n(3)\n4 ) = 13, the set\n(\nX0\n3\n)\ncontains a monochromatic copy\nC of C (3)4 . It cannot be blue because all pairs of vertices of X are in \u2202A and so C would\nbe in A. Hence, C must be red and, thus, in C1red or C2red because\n(\nX0\n2\n) \u2282 \u2202C1red \u222a \u2202C2red.\nNow, we are ready to finish the proof of Theorem 7.1 in Subcase 2a. Recall that\nc0 = 25\n\u221a\n7 and t \u0003 7s. Suppose first that Vred = \u2205. By Observation 7.8, every set of 25\u221at\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 191\nvertices in Vblue = V contains a copy of C\n(3)\n4 in C\n1\nred or C\n2\nred. Hence, we can find greedily,\nby taking one edge from a copy of C (3)4 and re-using the remaining vertex, a matching of\nsize (\nt \u2212 25\u221at)\/3 \u0002 (6s+ c0\u221as \u2212 25\u221a7s)\/3 \u0002 2s\nin C1red \u222a C2red. Thus, there is an index i \u2208 {1, 2} such that Cired contains M(3)s as well as a\ncopy of C (3)4 .\nAssume now that Vred \u0004= \u2205 and, thus, S exists and C1red = S . We know (see Observa-\ntion 7.5) that A contains a matching MA, V (MA) \u2282 Vblue, of size s but no C (3)4 . As in\nthe proof of Observation 7.2, for every vertex x \u2208 Vred and each edge e \u2208 MA, there\nexists a edge f \u2208 S so that x \u2208 f and |e \u2229 f| = 2. Hence, we can find a matching\nof size |Vred| < s in S that uses exactly 2|Vred| vertices of Vblue. After this, we use\nthe greedy procedure from the previous paragraph and find a matching in S \u222a C2red\nof size (|Vblue| \u2212 2|Vred| \u2212 25\u221at)\/3. Combining these two matchings and the fact that\n|Vblue| + |Vred| = |V | = t yields a matching in S \u222a C2red of size\n|Vred| + (|Vblue| \u2212 2|Vred| \u2212 25\u221at)\/3 \u0002 (t \u2212 25\u221a7s)\/3 \u0002 2s,\nas before. Consequently, either S or C2red contains M\n(3)\ns . Note that at least one edge of this\nmatching comes from a copy of C (3)4 in S or C\n2\nred. Thus, in either case, we have M\n(3)\ns and\nC\n(3)\n4 in the same red component.\nSubcase 2b. Inequality (7.4) does not hold for any two red components C1red and C\n2\nred.\nWe will first show that in this case the red components can be grouped into three large\nsets. To this end, we need the following simple fact. (We will only need part (b) now; part\n(a) will be used twice in Section 8.)\nFact 7.9. For given numbers a1 \u0002 a2 \u0002 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u0002 ak \u0002 0, let N = a1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + ak .\n(a) Let d \u0002 2N\/3 and k \u0002 2. If a1 \u0003 d, then there exists 1 \u0003 \u00070 \u0003 k \u2212 1 such that N \u2212 d \u0003\u2211\u00070\ni=1 ai \u0003 d.\n(b) Let N \u0002 5r and k \u0002 3. If a1 + a2 \u0003 N \u2212 2r, then there exist 1 \u0003 \u00071 < \u00072 \u0003 k \u2212 1 such\nthat\n\u2211\u00071\ni=1 ai \u0002 r,\n\u2211\u00072\ni=\u00071+1\nai \u0002 r, and\n\u2211k\ni=\u00072+1\nai \u0002 r.\nProof. (a) Define \u00070 = min{\u0007 :\u2211\u0007i=1 ai \u0002 N \u2212 d}. If \u00070 = 1 then we are done. Otherwise,\na\u00070 \u0003 a1 < N \u2212 d, and so\nN \u2212 d \u0003\n\u00070\u2211\ni=1\nai \u0003 (N \u2212 d) + a\u00070 < 2(N \u2212 d) \u0003 d.\n(b) If a1 \u0002 a2 \u0002 r, take \u00071 = 1 and \u00072 = 2. If a1 \u0002 r but a2 < r, take \u00071 = 1 and define\n\u00072 = min{\u0007 :\u2211\u0007i=2 ai \u0002 r}. Then,\n\u00072\u2211\ni=1\nai = a1 +\n\u00072\u22121\u2211\ni=2\nai + a\u00072 < a1 + r + a2 \u0003 N \u2212 r,\n192 P. E. Haxell, T. \u0002Luczak, Y. Peng, V. Ro\u00a8dl, A. Rucin\u00b4ski and J. Skokan\nand so\n\u2211k\ni=\u00072+1\nai \u0002 r as well. Finally, if a2 \u0003 a1 < r, define \u00071 = min{\u0007 :\u2211\u0007i=1 ai \u0002 r} and\n\u00072 = min{\u0007 :\u2211\u0007i=\u00071+1 ai \u0002 r}. Then\n\u00071\u2211\ni=1\nai \u0003\n\u00071\u22121\u2211\ni=1\nai + a1 \u0003 2r\nand, similarly,\n\u2211\u00072\ni=\u00071+1\nai \u0003 2r. Hence,\nk\u2211\ni=\u00072+1\nai \u0002 N \u2212 4r \u0002 r.\nNow we can prove the following consequence of negating (7.4).\nObservation 7.10. There exists a partition\n(\nV\n2\n)\n= F1 \u222a F2 \u222a F3 such that:\n(i) F1, F2, F3 are pairwise disjoint,\n(ii) |Fi[Vblue]| \u0002 3t for i = 1, 2, 3,\n(iii) for every red component Cred there exists i \u2208 {1, 2, 3} such that \u2202Cred \u2282 Fi.\nProof. The shadows of all red components, intersected by\n(\nVblue\n2\n)\n, form a partition of\n(\nVblue\n2\n)\ninto disjoint sets of pairs. (Each pair that is not in any red edge is in a partition class by\nitself.) Let a1 \u0002 a2 \u0002 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 be the sizes of these partition classes. If (7.4) does not hold for\nany two red components then a1 + a2 \u0003\n(|Vblue|\n2\n)\u2212 6t and, by Fact 7.9(b) with N = (|Vblue|\n2\n)\nand r = 3t, the ais can be grouped into three sums, each at least 3t. Let the corresponding\nthree sets of pairs, forming a partition of\n(\nVblue\n2\n)\n, be denoted by F\u02dc i, i = 1, 2, 3. Then the\nconclusion follows with Fis being arbitrary extensions of F\u02dc is such that, for each red\ncomponent Cred if \u2202Cred \u2229 (Vblue2 ) \u2282 F\u02dc i, then \u2202Cred \u2282 Fi.\nFor convenience, set F\u02dc i = Fi[Vblue] and degi(v) = degF\u02dc i (v), i = 1, 2, 3, v \u2208 Vblue.\nObservation 7.11. For every vertex v \u2208Vblue there is an index i\u2208 {1, 2, 3} so that degi(v)= 0.\nProof. Suppose that there is a vertex v \u2208 Vblue such that degi(v) > 0 for all i = 1, 2, 3,\nand denote by Ui the neighbourhood of v in F\u02dc\ni, i = 1, 2, 3. Notice that F\u02dc1 \u222a F\u02dc2 \u222a F\u02dc3 is a\npartition of\n(\nVblue\n2\n)\n(cf. Observation 7.10) and, therefore, U1 \u222a U2 \u222a U3 \u222a {v} is a partition\nof Vblue.\nTake any three vertices ui \u2208 Ui, i = 1, 2, 3. Since the pairs vu1, vu2, vu3 belong to the\nshadows of distinct red components, all edges vuiuj , 1 \u0003 i < j \u0003 3, are blue and thus in\nthe azure component A (because v \u2208 Vblue).\nConsequently, since there is no C (3)4 in A, the edge u1u2u3 must be red. Thus, all pairs of\nvertices ui \u2208 Ui and uj \u2208 Uj , i \u0004= j, are in the shadow of the same red component. Without\nloss of generality we may assume that\n\u2200ui \u2208 Ui, uj \u2208 Uj, i \u0004= j, uiuj \u2208 F\u02dc1. (7.7)\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 193\nFigure 3. Partitioning\n(Vblue\n2\n)\ninto F\u02dc1, F\u02dc2 and F\u02dc3. Labels on an edge correspond to possible partition classes\nfor this edge.\nTake any three vertices ui, u\n\u2032\ni, uj , such that ui, u\n\u2032\ni \u2208 Ui and uj \u2208 Uj . Since the edges vuiuj\nand vu\u2032iuj are both in A and C\n(3)\n4 \u0004\u2282 A, either vuiu\u2032i is red or uiu\u2032iuj is red. In the first case,\nuiu\n\u2032\ni \u2208 F\u02dc i, while in the second case uiu\u2032i \u2208 F\u02dc1.\nThe previous two paragraphs show that every pair of vertices uu\u2032, where u, u\u2032 \u2208 {v} \u222a\nU1 \u222a U3 or u \u2208 U1 \u222a U3, u\u2032 \u2208 U2, is contained in F\u02dc1 \u222a F\u02dc3. Since F\u02dc2 is disjoint from F\u02dc1 \u222a F\u02dc3,\nit follows that all pairs of F\u02dc2 are contained in {v} \u222a U2. The same argument (see Figure 3)\nyields that all pairs of F\u02dc3 are contained in {v} \u222a U3. Each F\u02dc i, i = 2, 3, can contain at most\ndegi(v) pairs of the form vui, ui \u2208 Ui, and |F\u02dc i| \u0002 3t > degi(v). Hence there exist vertices\nui, u\n\u2032\ni \u2208 Ui such that uiu\u2032i \u2208 F\u02dc i, i = 2, 3.\nIf all four edges induced by {u2, u\u20322, u3, u\u20323} \u2282 Vblue were blue, we would have C (3)4 in A \u2013\na contradiction with (7.3). Hence, at least one of them is red, say u2u\n\u2032\n2u3. Since by (7.7)\nu2u3 \u2208 F\u02dc1, we have u2u\u20322 \u2208 F\u02dc1. But then u2u\u20322 \u2208 F\u02dc1 \u2229 F\u02dc2 \u2282 F1 \u2229 F2 \u2013 a contradiction with\nObservation 7.10(i).\nFor 1 \u0003 i < j \u0003 3, let Wij = {v \u2208 Vblue : degi(v) > 0, degj(v) > 0}. Next, we prove that\nW12,W13, and W23 have each at least two vertices.\nObservation 7.12. |Wij | \u0002 2 for 1 \u0003 i < j \u0003 3.\nProof. By symmetry, we can restrict ourselves to the case i = 1 and j = 2. Since |F\u02dc i| \u0002 3t,\ni = 1, 2, there is a matching Mi of size four in |F\u02dc i|. Let u1u\u20321 \u2208 M1 and u2u\u20322 \u2208 M2 be vertex-\ndisjoint. Since, by (7.3), the copy of C (3)4 induced by {u1, u\u20321, u2, u\u20322} \u2282 Vblue cannot be blue,\nat least one of its edges must be red. However, then at least one pair from u1u2, u1u\n\u2032\n2,\nu\u20321u2, u\u20321u\u20322 is in F\u02dc1 or F\u02dc2. This implies that at least one of these vertices is adjacent to an\nedge of F\u02dc1 and an edge of F\u02dc2 and, thus, belongs to W12. Now we remove that vertex and\n194 P. E. Haxell, T. \u0002Luczak, Y. Peng, V. Ro\u00a8dl, A. Rucin\u00b4ski and J. Skokan\nfind another pair of disjoint edges, one from M1, the other from M2. Repeating the above\nreasoning, we obtain another vertex in W12, completing the proof.\nLet w12, w\n\u2032\n12 \u2208 W12, w13, w\u203213 \u2208 W13, w23, w\u203223 \u2208 W23. Clearly, by Observation 7.11,\nfor all 1 \u0003 i < j \u0003 3 and 1 \u0003 i\u2032 < j \u2032 \u0003 3, {i, j} \u0004= {i\u2032, j \u2032}, the pairs wijwi\u2032j \u2032 ,\nw\u2032ijwi\u2032j \u2032 , wijw\u2032i\u2032j \u2032 , w\u2032ijw\u2032i\u2032j \u2032 are from F\u0007, where \u0007 = {i, j} \u2229 {i\u2032, j \u2032}. (7.8)\nWe show now that the sub-hypergraph H induced in K by vertices w12, w\n\u2032\n12, w13, w\n\u2032\n13, w23,\nw\u203223 \u2208 Vblue contains a copy of C (3)5 in the azure component A.\nSince F1 \u2229 F2 = \u2205, the pair w12w\u203212 is either not contained in F1 or not contained in\nF2. (At this point, we do not know whether or not w12w\n\u2032\n12 \u2208 F1 \u222a F2.) Without loss of\ngenerality we may assume that w12w\n\u2032\n12 is not contained in F\n1. Also, at least one edge of\nthe sub-hypergraph of K induced by vertices w12, w\n\u2032\n12, w13, w\n\u2032\n13 must be red (otherwise we\nwould have C (3)4 in the azure component \u2013 a contradiction to (7.3)).\nEdges w12w\n\u2032\n12w13 and w12w\n\u2032\n12w\n\u2032\n13 must be blue because w12w13, w12w\n\u2032\n13 \u2208 F1 by (7.8) and\nw12w\n\u2032\n12 does not belong to F\n1. Hence, either w12w13w\n\u2032\n13 or w\n\u2032\n12w13w\n\u2032\n13 is red, and the pair\nw13w\n\u2032\n13 must lie in F\n1. Since F1 and F3 are disjoint, w13w\n\u2032\n13 does not lie in F\n3.\nUsing the same argument we infer that w23w\n\u2032\n23 belongs to F\n3: to avoid a contradiction\nwith (7.3), at least one of the edges induced by w23, w\n\u2032\n23, w13, w\n\u2032\n13 must be red. Edges\nw13w\n\u2032\n13w23 and w13w\n\u2032\n13w\n\u2032\n23 must be blue because, by (7.8), w13w23, w13w\n\u2032\n23 \u2208 F3 and w13w\u203213\ndoes not lie in F3. Hence, either w13w23w\n\u2032\n23 or w\n\u2032\n13w23w\n\u2032\n23 is red, implying that the pair\nw23w\n\u2032\n23 is in F\n3 (and, consequently, not in F2). Similarly, we get w12w\n\u2032\n12 \u2208 F2.\nObserve now that all edges of the form v12v13v23, where vij \u2208 {wij , w\u2032ij}, are blue because,\nby (7.8), the pairs contained in them belong to different Fis and the shadow of every\ncomponent is contained in a unique Fi. Moreover, the edges w12w\n\u2032\n12w13, w12w\n\u2032\n12w\n\u2032\n13,\nw13w\n\u2032\n13w23, w13w\n\u2032\n13w\n\u2032\n23, w23w\n\u2032\n23w12, and w23w\n\u2032\n23w\n\u2032\n12 must be blue as well because, again,\nall the pairs contained in any red edge belong to the shadow of the same red component\n(and to a unique Fi), which is not the case here.\nTherefore, all edges w12w23w13, w23w13w\n\u2032\n13, w13w\n\u2032\n13w\n\u2032\n23, w\n\u2032\n13w\n\u2032\n23w12, and w\n\u2032\n23w12w23 of the\ncycle C (3)5 on vertices w12, w23, w13, w\n\u2032\n13, w\n\u2032\n23 are coloured blue and belong to the azure\ncomponent.\n8. Matchings in components (the real thing)\nIn this section we prove Lemma 2.1. Since the hypergraph K appearing in Lemma 2.1 is\nalmost complete, we will be guided by the proof of Theorem 6.1 presented in Section 6.\nHowever, it will be convenient to replace K with a large sub-hypergraph K1 with a more\nregular structure. Its existence is guaranteed by the following simple lemma.\nFor a vertex x in a hypergraph H , let NH (x) = {y : xy \u2208 \u2202H}. For two vertices x, y,\nlet NH (x, y) = {z : xyz \u2208 H}. Note that if y \u2208 NH (x) (equivalently, x \u2208 NH (y)), then\nNH (x, y) \u0004= \u2205. We call all such pairs xy of vertices active. Thus, the active pairs in H\nare exactly those pairs of vertices which belong to the shadow \u2202H of H .\nLemma 8.1. Fix \u03b4 > 0 and set \u03b41 = 10\u03b4\n1\/6. Let K be a 3-uniform hypergraph with t vertices\nand at least (1 \u2212 \u03b4)(t\n3\n)\nedges. Then K contains a sub-hypergraph K1 with t1 \u0002 (1 \u2212 \u03b41)t\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 195\nvertices such that every vertex x of K1 is in an active pair and for all active pairs xy we\nhave |NK1 (x, y)| \u0002 (1 \u2212 \u03b41)t1.\nA (fairly standard) proof of Lemma 8.1 can be found in [11] (see Lemma 4.1 therein).\nProof of Lemma 2.1. We may assume that \u03b7 < 1. Given 0 < \u03b7 < 1, define \u03b4 = \u03b7610\u221224.\nFor any hypergraph K on t = (4 + \u03b7)s vertices and with at least (1 \u2212 \u03b4)(t\n3\n)\nedges, let K1\nbe the sub-hypergraph of K satisfying the conclusions of Lemma 8.1 with \u03b41 = 10\u03b4\n1\/6 =\n\u03b7\/1000. In particular, using the bound t < 5s, we get\nt1 = |V (K1)| \u0002 (1 \u2212 \u03b41)t \u0002 t \u2212 5\u03b41s = t \u2212 (\u03b7\/200)s > (4 + \u03b7\/2)s.\nSince every monochromatic component of K1 is contained in a monochromatic component\nof K , it is enough to show the conclusion of Lemma 2.1 for K1. For the clarity of our\npresentation we will reset K := K1, \u03b4 := \u03b41 and \u03b7 := 2\u03b7. Equivalently, we will assume\nthat K has t = (4 + \u03b7)s vertices, 0 < \u03b7 < 1\/2, every vertex x of K is in an active pair, and\nfor all active pairs xy,\n|NK (x, y)| \u0002 (1 \u2212 \u03b4)t, (8.1)\nwhere \u03b4 = \u03b7\/500.\nSince every x is in an active pair, it follows from (8.1) that for all x \u2208 V (K),\n|NK (x)| = |{y : xy \u2208 \u2202K}| \u0002 (1 \u2212 \u03b4)t+ 1. (8.2)\nLet V = V (K) and fix a colouring K = Kred \u222a Kblue. Our ultimate goal is to show that\neither in Kred or in Kblue there is an externally connected matching M\n(3)\ns . We begin with\nsome preliminary results. Our first observation establishes for every x \u2208 V the existence\nof a dominant monochromatic component Cx, the shadow of which contains most pairs\nof vertices xy. (For the complete hypergraph K this was done in Observation 6.2.)\nObservation 8.2. For every vertex x \u2208 V there exists a monochromatic component Cx such\nthat\n|{y \u2208 V : xy \u2208 \u2202Cx}| \u0002 (1 \u2212 \u03b4)t. (8.3)\nThe observation will follow from a simple graph-theoretic result.\nFact 8.3. Let G be a graph with n vertices and minimum degree d. If n > d \u0002 3n\/4, then\nfor every red\u2013blue colouring of the edges of G there is a monochromatic component with at\nleast d+ 1 vertices.\nProof. Let G = Gred \u222a Gblue be a red\u2013blue colouring of the edges of G. Suppose that no\ncomponent of Gred has more than d vertices. Then, by Fact 7.9(a) in Section 7 there is a\npartition V (G) = V1 \u222a V2, where\nn \u2212 d \u0003 |V1| \u0003 n\n2\n\u0003 |V2| \u0003 d and EGred (V1, V2) = \u2205.\n196 P. E. Haxell, T. \u0002Luczak, Y. Peng, V. Ro\u00a8dl, A. Rucin\u00b4ski and J. Skokan\nObserve that in Gblue every vertex of V2 has a neighbour in V1 and every vertex of V1 has\nmore than |V2|\/2 neighbours in V2. Thus, the graph Gblue is connected, and so there is a\nblue component on all n \u0002 d+ 1 vertices.\nProof of Observation 8.2. Note that \u03b4 < 1\/4 and that, by (8.1), for every vertex x \u2208 V the\ngraph K(x) = {yz : xyz \u2208 K} has minimum degree at least (1 \u2212 \u03b4)t \u0002 3t\/4 (and at most\nt vertices). The colouring K = Kred \u222a Kblue induces a colouring K(x) = Kred(x) \u222a Kblue(x)\nwhich, by Fact 8.3, contains a monochromatic component with at least (1 \u2212 \u03b4)t vertices.\nConsequently, there is a monochromatic component C in K such that \u2202C contains at\nleast (1 \u2212 \u03b4)t pairs xy.\nFor each x \u2208 V let us choose arbitrarily one component satisfying the condition in\nObservation 8.2 and denote it by Cx. Let\nVred = {x \u2208 V : Cx is red} and Vblue = {x \u2208 V : Cx is blue}.\nObservation 8.2 tells us that V = Vred \u222a Vblue and this union is disjoint by the definition\nof Vred and Vblue.\nOur next result says that for most x \u2208 Vred, as well as for most x \u2208 Vblue, the components\nCx are the same. (For the complete hypergraph K this is Observation 6.3.)\nObservation 8.4. If |Vred| \u0002 6\u03b4t (|Vblue| \u0002 6\u03b4t, respectively) then there is a red component\nCred (a blue component Cblue) so that Cx = Cred (Cx = Cblue) for all but at most 2\u03b4t vertices\nx \u2208 Vred (x \u2208 Vblue).\nProof. Consider a graph G defined on Vred by putting an edge between x and y whenever\nxy \u2208 \u2202Cx \u2229 \u2202Cy (note that by (6.4) this means that Cx = Cy). By Observation 8.2 every\nvertex \u2018spoils\u2019 at most \u03b4t edges, and thus |E(G)| \u0002 (v\n2\n)\u2212 v\u03b4t, where v = |Vred|. Our goal is\nto show that G has a component of order at least v \u2212 2\u03b4t. Suppose this is not true. Then,\nby Fact 7.9(a) in Section 7 with d = v \u2212 2\u03b4t, there is a partition Vred = V1 \u222a V2 with\n2\u03b4t \u0003 |V1|, |V2| \u0003 v \u2212 2\u03b4t and EG(V1, V2) = \u2205,\nwhich yields at least 2\u03b4t(v \u2212 2\u03b4t) > v\u03b4t edges in the complement of G \u2013 a contradiction.\nIf |Vred| \u0002 6\u03b4t, we define the scarlet component S as the (unique) red component Cred\nguaranteed by Observation 8.4 and set\nV \u2032red = {x \u2208 Vred : Cx = S}.\nThen\n|V \u2032red| \u0002 |Vred| \u2212 2\u03b4t \u0002 4\u03b4t.\nIf |Vred| < 6\u03b4t, then we say that the scarlet component does not exist and V \u2032red = \u2205.\nSimilarly, when |Vblue| \u0002 6\u03b4t, we define the azure component A and the set\nV \u2032blue = {x \u2208 Vblue : Cx = A}.\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 197\nThen\n|V \u2032blue| \u0002 |Vblue| \u2212 2\u03b4t \u0002 4\u03b4t,\nand V \u2032blue = \u2205 if |Vblue| < 6\u03b4t. We also set\nV \u2032 = V \u2032red \u222a V \u2032blue.\nSince \u03b4 < 1\/12,\n|V \u2032| = |V \u2032red| + |V \u2032blue| \u0002 t \u2212 8\u03b4t. (8.4)\nFor each x \u2208 V \u2032red, set\n\u2202S(x) = |{y \u2208 V : xy \u2208 \u2202S}|,\nand for each x \u2208 V \u2032blue, set\n\u2202A(x) = |{y \u2208 V : xy \u2208 \u2202A}|.\nBy Observation 8.2 and the definitions of S and A we have\n|\u2202S(x)|, |\u2202A(x)| \u0002 (1 \u2212 \u03b4)t. (8.5)\nOur last preliminary result is the Mirror Lemma (cf. Lemma 6.7) adjusted to non-\ncomplete hypergraphs.\nLemma 8.5 (The Blurred Mirror Lemma). Let M be a largest matching in a red compon-\nent Cred and let P \u2282 V , where P \u2229 V (M) = \u2205 and |P | \u0002 |M| + 30\u03b4t. Assume further that for\nsome blue component Cblue and for every e \u2208 M, the bipartite induced subgraph \u2202Cblue[e, P ]\nof \u2202Cblue contains K2,|P |\u22129\u03b4t\u22121. Then there exists a matching M \u2032 \u2282 Cblue such that:\n(i) |M \u2032| \u0002 |M| and\n(ii) |V (M \u2032) \u2229 P | \u0003 |M| + 4\u03b4t.\nProof. Let M \u2032\u2032 \u2282 Cblue be a largest matching such that:\n\u2022 |V (M \u2032\u2032) \u2229 P | \u0003 |M \u2032\u2032| and\n\u2022 V (M \u2032\u2032) intersects at most |M \u2032\u2032| edges of M. (8.6)\nWe first claim that |M \u2032\u2032| \u0002 |M| \u2212 4\u03b4t. Indeed, suppose |M \u2032\u2032| \u0003 |M| \u2212 4\u03b4t. We will show\nthat there exist e1, e2 \u2208 M and a, b, c \u2208 P \u2032\u2032 := P\\V (M \u2032\u2032) such that (e1 \u222a e2) \u2229 V (M \u2032\u2032) = \u2205\nand the set X = e1 \u222a e2 \u222a {a, b, c} satisfies the assumptions of Claim 6.5 (see Remark 6.6).\nFrom the second part of (8.6) and our supposed bound on |M \u2032\u2032|, it follows that there\nexist at least 4\u03b4t edges of M disjoint from V (M \u2032\u2032). Let e1 = uvw \u2208 M be any such edge.\nBelow we suppress the dependence on K and write N(x) for the neighbourhood of x in\nthe shadow of K , and N(x, y) for the neighbourhood of x, y in K . By (8.2),\n|V\\(N(u) \u2229 N(v) \u2229 N(w))| \u0003 3t \u2212 |N(u)| \u2212 |N(v)| \u2212 |N(w)| \u0003 3\u03b4t\nand so there exists e2 = xyz \u2208 M\\e1 such that e2 \u2229 V (M \u2032\u2032) = \u2205 and every pair of vertices\np, q \u2208 e1 \u222a e2 = {u, v, w, x, y, z} is active.\n198 P. E. Haxell, T. \u0002Luczak, Y. Peng, V. Ro\u00a8dl, A. Rucin\u00b4ski and J. Skokan\nBy the first part of (8.6) and our bounds on |P | and |M \u2032\u2032|, we have\n|P \u2032\u2032| = |P | \u2212 |P \u2229 V (M \u2032\u2032)| \u0002 |M| + 30\u03b4t \u2212 (|M| \u2212 4\u03b4t) = 34\u03b4t.\nAmong the vertices of P \u2032\u2032 at most 18\u03b4t+ 2 do not belong to the bipartite cliques\nK2,|P |\u22129\u03b4t\u22121 between ei, i = 1, 2, and P , guaranteed by the assumptions. Also, by (8.1),\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223P \u2032\u2032\\\u22c2\np,q\nN(p, q)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u0003\n(\n6\n2\n)\n\u03b4t = 15\u03b4t,\nwhere the intersection is taken over all pairs of vertices p, q \u2208 e1 \u222a e2. Since (34 \u2212 18 \u2212\n15)\u03b4t \u2212 2 \u0002 3, one can choose a, b, c \u2208 P \u2032\u2032 so that:\n(a) \u2202Cblue[ei, {a, b, c}] \u2283 K2,3 for i = 1, 2, and\n(b) all triples of vertices having two vertices in {u, v, w, x, y, z} and one in {a, b, c} are edges\nof K .\nThus, we can apply Claim 6.5 (see Remark 6.6) to the set X = e1 \u222a e2 \u222a {a, b, c}. But\nthen we can either enlarge M in Cred (if (1) of Claim 6.5 occurs) or M\n\u2032\u2032 in Cblue with\nconditions (8.6) preserved (if (2) or (3) of Claim 6.5 occurs), yielding a contradiction with\nthe choice of M or M \u2032\u2032, respectively.\nHence |M \u2032\u2032| \u0002 |M| \u2212 4\u03b4t. If |M \u2032\u2032| \u0002 |M|, we are done. Otherwise, we repeat the following\nprocedure which keeps enlarging M \u2032\u2032 by increments of two until its size reaches |M| (for\nconvenience, we assume that |M| \u2212 |M \u2032\u2032| is even). Let the current matching be denoted by\nM \u2032, |M \u2032| < |M|. It is important that in each step we will\n\u2022 not delete any edge of M \u2032, that is, M \u2032\u2032 \u2286 M \u2032,\n\u2022 add to V (M \u2032) at most four vertices of P , and\n\u2022 maintain the second part of (8.6).\nSince there are (|M| \u2212 |M \u2032\u2032|)\/2 steps, for the final M \u2032 we have\n|V (M \u2032) \u2229 P | \u0003 |M \u2032\u2032| + 2(|M| \u2212 |M \u2032\u2032|) = |M| + (|M| \u2212 |M \u2032\u2032|) \u0003 |M| + 4\u03b4t,\nso (ii) holds. Now we describe a single step of the procedure. Let e = xyz \u2208 M be such\nthat e \u2229 V (M \u2032) = \u2205. Denote by P0 the set of at most 9\u03b4t+ 1 vertices of P which do not\nbelong to the bipartite clique K2,|P |\u22129\u03b4t\u22121 between e and P , guaranteed by the assumptions.\nSet P \u2032 = P\\(V (M \u2032) \u222a P0). As above,\n|P \u2032| \u0002 |M| + 30\u03b4t \u2212 (|M| + 4\u03b4t) \u2212 |P0| \u0002 16\u03b4t.\nSet N1 = P\n\u2032 \u2229 N(x, y) \u2229 N(x, z) \u2229 N(y, z). By (8.1), |N1| > (16 \u2212 3)\u03b4t = 13\u03b4t. Let a \u2208 N1\nand set N2 = N1 \u2229 N(a, x) \u2229 N(a, y) \u2229 N(a, z). We have, again by (8.1), |N2| > 10\u03b4t. Simil-\narly, for every b \u2208 N2 and every c \u2208 N3 = N2 \u2229 N(b, x) \u2229 N(b, y) \u2229 N(b, z), we have\n|N3 \u2229 N(c, x) \u2229 N(c, y) \u2229 N(c, z)| > 4\u03b4t \u0002 1.\nThus, one can choose a, b, c, d \u2208 P \u2032 so that:\n(a) \u2202Cblue[e, {a, b, c}] \u2283 K2,3,\n(b) all triples of vertices within {x, y, z, a, b, c, d} intersecting simultaneously {x, y, z} and\n{a, b, c, d} are edges of K .\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 199\nWe apply Claim 6.4 (see Remark 6.6) to the set X = e \u222a {a, b, c, d}. By the maximality of M\nin Cred and the maximality of M\n\u2032\u2032 with respect to (8.6) in Cblue (note that V (M \u2032\u2032) \u2229 X = \u2205),\nconclusions (1) and (2) of Claim 6.4 cannot hold. Thus, (3) holds, which allows us to\nenlarge M \u2032 by adding the edges e1 and e2 guaranteed by Claim 6.4(3). Note that, indeed,\nin a single step we have used four vertices of P and one edge of M.\nWe are now ready to complete the proof of Lemma 2.1. Since \u03b4 < 1\/12, in view of\nObservation 8.4, either the scarlet component S or the azure component A (or both) does\nexist.\nLet M be a matching of maximum size in K among all matchings that lie in S or A.\nWithout loss of generality we assume that \u2205 \u0004= M \u2282 S . This implies that |V \u2032red| \u0002 4\u03b4t, but\nV \u2032blue might be empty, that is, the azure component A might not exist. Suppose that\n1 \u0003 m = |M| \u0003 s \u2212 1\nand set\nR = V \u2032red\\V (M) and B = V \u2032blue\\V (M). (8.7)\nAccording to this definition, if B \u0004= \u2205, then V \u2032blue \u0004= \u2205, and consequently, the azure\ncomponent A does exist. Note that R \u2229 B = \u2205 and\nt = (4 + \u03b7)s = 3m+ |R \u222a B| + |V\\V \u2032|, (8.8)\nand, using m < s and (8.4),\n|R \u222a B| \u0002 (4 + \u03b7)s \u2212 3m \u2212 |V\\V \u2032| \u0002 (1 + \u03b7)s \u2212 8\u03b4t. (8.9)\nObserve that by (8.9) and our choice of \u03b4, whenever one of the sets R or B has size at\nmost 5\u03b4t then the other one has size at least\n(1 + \u03b7)s \u2212 13\u03b4t \u0002 m+ 30\u03b4t.\nWe first show the following variant of Observation 6.8.\nObservation 8.6. If |R| \u0002 2\u03b4t, then all edges xyz \u2208 K[R \u222a B] with x \u2208 R and xy \u2208 \u2202S\nbelong to the same blue component Cblue. Furthermore, if also |B| \u0002 2\u03b4t, then Cblue = A.\nProof. First note that any red edge xyz \u2208 K[R \u222a B] with xy \u2208 \u2202S would be in S and\ndisjoint from V (M), and thus it could be added to M, contradicting the maximality of M.\nHence, every such edge is blue. Let x, y, z \u2208 R \u222a B and xy and xz be two pairs in \u2202S . Since\n|B \u222a R| \u0002 2\u03b4t and the pairs xy and xz are active, by (8.1) there exists w \u2208 R \u222a B such\nthat xyw \u2208 K and xzw \u2208 K . Hence, both edges are blue and in the same blue component.\nNow, by (8.5), the subgraph \u2202S[R] has minimum degree at least |R| \u2212 \u03b4t \u0002 |R|\/2, and\nthus it is connected. This implies that all pairs xy \u2208 \u2202S such that x \u2208 R and y \u2208 R \u222a B\nare in the shadow of the same blue component Cblue.\nTo prove the second part, notice that if both |R|, |B| \u0002 2\u03b4t then, again by (8.5), the\nnumber of edges of \u2202S with one endpoint in R and the other in B is more than |R||B|\/2,\n200 P. E. Haxell, T. \u0002Luczak, Y. Peng, V. Ro\u00a8dl, A. Rucin\u00b4ski and J. Skokan\nand the same is true for the edges of \u2202A. Hence, there is a pair x \u2208 R and y \u2208 B such\nthat xy \u2208 \u2202S \u2229 \u2202A. It follows that Cblue = A.\nFor the rest of the proof of Lemma 2.1 we distinguish three cases analogous to the\nthree cases considered in the proof of Theorem 6.1.\nCase 1. |B| \u0003 5\u03b4t.\nDenote by Cblue the blue component guaranteed by Observation 8.6.\nObservation 8.7. For every edge e \u2208 M, the bipartite induced subgraph \u2202Cblue[e, R] of \u2202Cblue\ncontains K2,|R|\u22123\u03b4t\u22121 as a subgraph.\nProof. Let e = xyz \u2208 M. By (8.2), at least |R| \u2212 3\u03b4t vertices a \u2208 R are such that all three\npairs xa, ya and za are active. Let the set of such vertices be denoted by Re.\nSuppose that \u2202Cblue[e, Re] contains no copy of K2,|Re|\u22121. Then there exist two vertices\na, b \u2208 Re such that, say, ya, zb \u0004\u2208 \u2202Cblue. Since |R| \u0002 2\u03b4t+ 5, by (8.5) and (8.1) there are\nc, d, u \u2208 R\\{a, b} such that ac, bd \u2208 \u2202S and yac, zbd, uac, ubd \u2208 K . By Observation 8.6,\nuac, ubd \u2208 Cblue and thus ac, bd \u2208 \u2202Cblue. Hence, the edges yac and zbd must be red.\nConsequently, yac, zbd \u2208 S and (M\\{xyz}) \u222a {yac, zbd} is a matching in S larger than\nM \u2013 a contradiction.\nNow we apply Lemma 8.5 with Cred = S , Cblue and P = R (recall that |R| \u0002 m+ 30\u03b4t),\nobtaining a matching M \u2032 \u2282 Cblue of size |M \u2032| := m\u2032 \u0002 m and with |V (M \u2032) \u2229 R| \u0003 m+ 4\u03b4t.\nIf m\u2032 \u0002 s, we are done. Otherwise, by (8.9) and (8.4), we have\n|R\\V (M \u2032)| \u0002 (4 + \u03b7)s \u2212 3m \u2212 13\u03b4t \u2212 (m+ 4\u03b4t) \u0002 3(s \u2212 m\u2032) + 3\u03b4t.\nThis allows us to enlarge M \u2032 to size s by adding blue edges contained in R\\V (M \u2032). Indeed,\nby (8.1) and (8.5), we can greedily find s \u2212 m\u2032 disjoint edges xyz \u2208 K[R] with xy \u2208 \u2202S .\nSince all such edges belong to Cblue (cf. Observation 8.6), we can add them to M\n\u2032 obtaining\na matching of size s in a blue component.\nCase 2. |R| \u0003 5\u03b4t.\nBy our assumptions and (8.9), B \u0004= \u2205 and thus the azure component A exists.\nObservation 8.8. For every edge e \u2208 M, the bipartite induced subgraph \u2202A[e, B] of \u2202A\ncontains K2,|B|\u22129\u03b4t\u22121 as a subgraph.\nProof. Fix an edge xyz \u2208 M. By (8.1), at least |B| \u2212 3\u03b4t vertices a \u2208 B are such that all\nthree pairs xa, ya and za are active. Let the set of such vertices be denoted by Be. Call a\nvertex a \u2208 Be friendly to x if xa \u2208 \u2202S \u222a \u2202A and let Bx be the subset of Be containing all\nunfriendly vertices to x.\nClaim 8.9. |Bx| < 2\u03b4t.\nThe Ramsey Number for 3-Uniform Tight Hypergraph Cycles 201\nProof. Suppose that |Bx| \u0002 2\u03b4t, recall that |V \u2032red| \u0002 4\u03b4t (since S exists), and consider the\nbipartite induced subgraphs GS and GA of \u2202S and \u2202A, respectively, with vertex set Bx \u222a\nV \u2032red. Assume for simplicity that |Bx| = 2\u03b4t and |V \u2032red| = 4\u03b4t, taking subsets if necessary.\nRecalling that Bx \u2282 V \u2032blue, by (8.5), |GS | \u0002 4(\u03b4t)2 and |GA| \u0002 6(\u03b4t)2, and consequently,\n|GS \u2229 GA| \u0002 2(\u03b4t)2. Let a \u2208 Bx have degree at least \u03b4t in GS \u2229 GA. Then, by (8.1) and the\ndefinition of Be, one can find a vertex u \u2208 V \u2032red such that xau \u2208 K and au \u2208 GS \u2229 GA \u2282\n\u2202S \u2229 \u2202A, which contradicts the assumption that a is unfriendly to x, no matter how xau\nis coloured.\nSet B\u2032e = Be\\(Bx \u222a By \u222a Bz). It is sufficient to show that \u2202A[e, B\u2032e] contains a copy\nof K2,|B\u2032e|\u22121. Suppose it does not. Then there exist two vertices a, b \u2208 B\u2032e such that, say,\nya, zb \u0004\u2208 \u2202A (and thus, they must be in \u2202S). Since |B| \u0002 2\u03b4t+ 4, by (8.5) and (8.1), there\nare c, d,\u2208 B\\{a, b} such that ac, bd \u2208 \u2202A and yac, zbd \u2208 K . Hence, the edges yac and zbd\nmust be red. Consequently, yac, zbd \u2208 S and (M\\{xyz}) \u222a {yac, zbd} is a matching in S\nlarger than M \u2013 a contradiction.\nWe apply Lemma 8.5 with Cred = S , Cblue = A and P = B (recall that |B| \u0002 m+ 30\u03b4t)\nand obtain a matching M \u2032 \u2282 A of size |M \u2032| = m and |V (M \u2032) \u2229 B| \u0003 m+ 4\u03b4t. (A matching\nlarger than m in the azure component A is impossible by our choice of M.)\nWe claim that R\u2032 := V \u2032red\\V (M \u2032) = \u2205. Indeed, suppose that d \u2208 R\u2032. Since\n|B\\V (M \u2032)| \u0002 s+ 18\u03b4t \u2212 (m+ 4\u03b4t) \u0002 14\u03b4t \u0002 2\u03b4t+ 3,\nby (8.5) and (8.1) we can find vertices a, b, c \u2208 B\\V (M \u2032) such that ad \u2208 \u2202S , ab \u2208 \u2202A,\nand abd, abc \u2208 K . Then both abc and abd are red (or we can enlarge M \u2032). But ad \u2208 \u2202S ,\ntherefore abd \u2208 S and, consequently, abc \u2208 S . Since {a, b, c} \u2229 V (M) = \u2205, we can enlarge\nM in S , which is a contradiction.\nThus |R\u2032| = 0 and we are back in Case 1 with the colours red and blue interchanged\nand M replaced by M \u2032.\nCase 3. |B|, |R| \u0002 5\u03b4t.\nSet P = R \u222a B. In this case not only the azure component A exists, but also the blue\ncomponent Cblue guaranteed by Lemma 8.6 is A.\nObservation 8.10. For every edge e \u2208 M, the bipartite induced subgraph \u2202A[e, B] of \u2202A\ncontains K2,|P |\u22129\u03b4t\u22121 as a subgraph.\nProof. The proof follows the lines of the proof of Observation 8.8. Fix an edge xyz \u2208 M.\nBy (8.2), at least |P | \u2212 3\u03b4t vertices a \u2208 P are such that all three pairs xa, ya and za are\nactive. Let the set of such vertices be denoted by Pe.\nRecall that a vertex a \u2208 Pe \u2229 B is friendly to x if xa \u2208 \u2202S \u222a \u2202A and let Bx be the\nsubset of unfriendly vertices of Pe \u2229 B. We have shown in Claim 8.9 that |Bx| \u0003 2\u03b4t.\nSet P \u2032e = Pe\\(Bx \u222a By \u222a Bz) and suppose that \u2202A[e, P \u2032e] contains no copy of K2,|P \u2032e |\u22121.\nThus, there exist two vertices a, b \u2208 P \u2032e such that, say, ya, zb \u0004\u2208 \u2202A. But then, combining\narguments from the proofs of Observations 8.7 and 8.8 (each of a and b can be in R or\n202 P. E. Haxell, T. \u0002Luczak, Y. Peng, V. Ro\u00a8dl, A. Rucin\u00b4ski and J. Skokan\nB), one can show that there exist vertices c, d \u2208 P such that yac, zbd \u2208 S . Consequently,\n(M\\{xyz}) \u222a {yac, zbd} is a red matching in S larger than M \u2013 a contradiction.\nWe apply Lemma 8.5 with Cred = S , Cblue = A and P = (R \u222a B)\\{a, b} where a \u2208 R, b \u2208\nB and ab is an active pair. Let M \u2032 be a matching in A satisfying conclusions (i) and (ii)\nof Lemma 8.5. By the maximality of M, we have |M \u2032| = m and, by (ii) and (8.9),\n|P\\V (M \u2032)| \u0002 s+ 30\u03b4t \u2212 8\u03b4t \u2212 (m+ 4\u03b4t) \u0002 18\u03b4t.\nBy (8.1) and (8.5), we can choose c \u2208 P\\V (M \u2032) so that ac \u2208 \u2202S , bc \u2208 \u2202A and abc \u2208 K .\nConsequently, abc \u2208 S if it is red and abc \u2208 A if it is blue. Also, abc is disjoint from both\nV (M) and V (M \u2032). Thus, either we obtain a matching of size m+ 1 in S , or a matching\nof size |M \u2032| + 1 = m+ 1 in A, contradicting the maximality of M among all matchings\ncontained in S or A.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was initiated as a group project of the authors, as part of a Focused Research\nGroup meeting at the Banff International Research Station in May 2003.\nWe thank Joanna Polcyn for her help in preparing Section 4 and an anonymous referee\nfor many helpful suggestions on the presentation of this paper.\nReferences\n[1] Bondy, J.
