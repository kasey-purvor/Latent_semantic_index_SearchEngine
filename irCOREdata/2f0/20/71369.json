For ex-6\nample, as pointed out to us by an anonymous reviewer, PSCs were recorded7\nin 1901 by the Danish painter Jorgensen. By the mid-20th century, scientists8\nhad found that the clouds formed at altitudes of around 25 km (i.e., the lower9\nstratosphere) and temperatures near -80 \u0089. Mother-of-pearl clouds are water10\nice clouds, formed within stratospheric gravity waves. Their rich colouration11\nis the result of forward diffraction of sunlight by the particles; the changes in12\ncolour occur because of the variations in particle size along the profile of the13\nwave (e.g., see Tolbert and Toon, 2001, and references within).14\n2\nFrom satellite and other observations in the last quarter of the twentieth cen-1\ntury, a simple three-stage model of PSC development began to emerge (Figure2\n1). This model starts with the background aerosol particles \u2014 consisting of3\nsupercooled sulphuric acid solution with about 75% by weight H2SO4 (Rosen,4\n1971) \u2014 which form the stratospheric Junge layer. As the temperature de-5\ncreases these particles may freeze to form sulphuric acid tetrahydrate (SAT)6\n(e.g., see Dye et al., 1992, and references within), although this step was not7\nalways included (e.g. Drdla and Turco, 1991). The essential features of this8\ntheory were that nucleation of NAT onto the background sulphate particles9\nwould occur below the NAT equilibrium temperature (192 < TNAT < 197K,10\nfor typical partial pressures of water vapour and nitric acid in the lower strato-11\nsphere), leading to Type I PSCs, and further cooling to below the ice frost12\npoint (188 < TICE < 190K) would result in the nucleation of water ice onto13\nthe NAT particles to form Type II PSCs.14\nHowever observational data suggested that the formation of PSCs was more15\ncomplicated. Measurements in the presence of Type I PSCs found that sub-16\nstantial transfer of HNO3 from the vapour to condensed phase only occurred17\nabout 3\u20134K below TNAT , and that the HNO3 partial pressures were signifi-18\ncantly higher than NAT vapour pressures (Rosen et al., 1989; Hofmann et al.,19\n1990; Schlager et al., 1990). These observations suggested that some unidenti-20\nfied process was causing a hysteresis effect, where the formation of NAT was21\nhampered until 3\u20134K below TNAT , but, once formed, it could exist up to TNAT .22\nThis led to proposals for different requirements for the formation of NAT par-23\nticles, ranging from the necessity of SAT as a nucleus, to free energy barriers24\n(see Dye et al., 1992, and references within). Rosen et al. (1989) interpreted25\nthe difference in vapour pressures as indicating the presence of another meta-26\n3\nstable nitric acid particle, possibly an amorphous solid-solution with variable1\ncomposition (Hamill et al., 1988). Analysis of lidar measurements (Browell2\net al., 1990; Toon et al., 1990) identified two distinct subtypes of nitric acid3\nparticles. Non-spherical particles, with a spherical volume-equivalent-radius4\nexceeding 1.0 \u00b5m were denoted as Type Ia, while Type Ib particles were clas-5\nsified as spherical with radii near 0.5 \u00b5m.6\nHanson (1990) suggested that, when the gas phase has not reached equilib-7\nrium with NAT, supercooled nitric acid solutions could condense up to a few8\ndegrees above the frost point. Laboratory experiments on the uptake of HNO39\nby H2SO4\/H2O solutions led Zhang et al. (1993) and Molina et al. (1993) to10\nconclude that, below TNAT , the background sulphuric droplets would take up11\nH2O and HNO3 to form a supercooled ternary solution (STS) particle, com-12\nposed of HNO3\/H2SO4\/H2O, which would freeze to NAT. PSC theory was,13\ntherefore, shifting away from the simple three-stage model focused on the solid14\nNAT and ice particles, with other particle phases merely facilitating phase-15\nchanges. Thermodynamical modelling studies by Carslaw et al. (1994) and16\nTabazadeh et al. (1994) demonstrated that STS particles could have HNO317\nmass fractions as high as 41%, with H2SO4 as low as 3%, in stratospheric con-18\nditions, provided the particles do not freeze. Tabazadeh et al. (1994) showed19\nthat the increase in mass of the particles \u2014 due to the uptake of H2O and20\nHNO3 \u2014 was sufficient to fulfill the size and shape definitions given for Type21\nIb particles by Toon et al. (1990). Carslaw et al. (1994) compared particle22\nvolumes observed by Dye et al. (1992) with those predicted using the differ-23\nent proposed PSC phases (Figure 2) and demonstrated that PSCs composed24\nof STS particles fitted the data much better than those composed of NAT25\nparticles. Bulk freezing experiments (Koop et al., 1995) and theoretical stud-26\n4\nies (MacKenzie et al., 1995) suggested that homogeneous nucleation rates of1\nNAT from STS were low enough to allow the existence of these liquid particles2\nbelow TNAT without freezing.3\nThe model of PSC development was now a lot more complicated (Figure 3,4\nand Peter (1997)). Three major types of PSC particle had been identified:5\nwater ice, NAT and STS. However it was not until five years later that in-situ6\nmeasurements of particle compositions in the Arctic positively identified the7\nexistence of NAT (Voigt et al., 2000a) and STS (Voigt et al., 2000b) in the8\nstratosphere. As the temperature decreases, the background sulphuric acid9\naerosol particles remain liquid, taking up H2O and HNO3 from the gas phase10\nto become STS particles a few degrees below TNAT . However the principal11\nnucleation mechanisms in the stratosphere for converting these liquid particles12\nto solid ice and NAT particles are still not clear.13\nBelow, we divide our review of PSC studies into three broad sections: a dis-14\ncussion of the instrumentation deployed in fieldwork, a discussion of PSC15\ncomposition in detail, and a discussion of the effects of PSCs.16\n2 Fieldwork Instrumentation17\nThe data used for PSC studies ranges from retrieved atmospheric composition18\nover synoptic scales by satellite-mounted instruments, to the in-situ measure-19\nment of particle compositions and gas-phase mixing ratios by balloon and20\naircraft mounted instruments. Most aspects of the stratosphere, from air tem-21\nperature and the mixing ratios of individual components, to the size, number22\nand composition of aerosol particles, can be studied. However, it is not al-23\n5\nways possible to measure all the atmospheric aspects relevant to a a PSC1\nsimultaneously and with the required precision.2\n2.1 Measuring Aerosol Properties3\nEven for a homogeneously mixed air parcel, an aerosol population will vary4\nacross several different properties, i.e., variations that produce the number,5\nsurface area, and volume density distributions, as well as variations in shape,6\ncomposition and phase (e.g., Jaenicke, 1998; Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006). Each7\nof these characteristics can be represented in a number of different ways, the8\naccuracies of which are usually determined by the limitations of the instru-9\nments being used. There are few instruments which can measure more than a10\none or two of these characteristics, and none which will measure all of them11\n(Hinds, 1999; Vincent, 2007).12\nThe information content of data from an aerosol instrument is limited by the13\nnumber of different measurements the instrument makes of the aerosol. For14\nexample, a single wavelength lidar will measure the backscatter and depolar-15\nisation caused by an aerosol. From these, and by making some assumptions,16\nwe can derive the total aerosol volume concentration (\u00b5m3 m\u22123), and an indi-17\ncation of the average particle shape. The total aerosol volume concentration18\nis determined by the number density and size distribution of the aerosol so,19\nby assuming a standard value for one of these characteristics, we can obtain20\nan estimate of the other.21\nTo minimise the assumptions required to characterise the aerosol, a number22\nof different instruments, chosen to complement each other, can be used. For23\n6\ninstance, it is becoming more common to use data from both optical particle1\ncounters and mass spectrometers to obtain data on both the sizes, number, and2\ncompositions of the particles (Peter, 1996; Schreiner et al., 1999). However,3\ncare must be taken that such combinations are viable. The data collected4\nby instruments provide a snap-shot of the atmospheric conditions. We must5\nmake sure that the samples, from which the data are obtained, are related both6\ntemporally and spatially, otherwise the information is likely to be misleading7\nwhen combined.8\n2.2 Synoptic and Global-Scale Measurements9\nThe first measurements of sub-visible PSCs were made using the SAM-II in-10\nstrument, mounted on the Nimbus-7 satellite (McCormick et al., 1981, 1982).11\nSAM-II, and the instruments which followed, are solar occultation photome-12\nters that measure the attenuation of light from the Sun as it passes through13\nthe atmosphere. Lines of sight through the atmosphere to the Sun are only14\npossible during sunrise and sunset, and measurements have sample volumes of15\nseveral hundred cubic kilometres. Analysis of each measurement is focused on16\nan air parcel centred at the point along the line of sight between the satellite17\nand the Sun which is closest to the surface of the Earth (SAGE III ATBD18\nTeam, 2002, available from NASA Langley Research Centre at http:\/\/www-19\nsage3.larc.nasa.gov\/).20\nThe data are processed to obtain the contributions to the solar attenuation21\nof effects such as Rayleigh scattering, aerosol extinction and absorption by22\ngaseous species. To produce vertical profiles, the contributions of the higher23\naltitudes to each measurement are subtracted. SAM-II measured only the 1 \u00b5m24\n7\nwavelength; however modern instruments take measurements across a number1\nof different wavelengths \u2014 the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment2\n(SAGE) III instrument produces data over 8 wavelengths between 0.29 and3\n1.55\u00b5m (SAGE III ATBD Team, 2002), while the Polar Ozone and Aerosol4\nMeasurement (POAM) III instrument produces aerosol extinction data for 65\nwavelengths between 0.353 and 1.018\u00b5m (Strawa et al., 2002).6\nFollowing McCormick et al. (1981), Poole and Pitts (1994) used the SAM-II7\naerosol extinction profiles to develop a long term PSC climatology. This in turn8\nhas been extended and improved by Fromm et al. (2003) to become a unified9\nstratospheric aerosol and cloud database which combines data from the SAM10\nII, SAGE II, and POAM II\/III missions. By taking the ratio of the aerosol11\nextinctions at 0.603 \u00b5m and 1.018 \u00b5m, Strawa et al. (2002) have demonstrated12\nthat POAM-III data can be used to distinguish synoptic-scale PSCs of types Ia13\nand Ib (Figure 4). They validated their method using lidar observations that14\nwere coincident with POAM observations. Poole et al. (2003), Lee et al. (2003)15\nand Kim et al. (2006) have extended the use of this technique to the analysis16\nof SAGE III measurements and ILAS-I\/ILAS-II measurements, respectively.17\nRelative extinction coefficients are calculated using adjacent transmittance18\nprofiles, one containing a PSC signature, the second containing none. A non-19\nlinear least squares fit method was used to compare the measured extinction20\nspectra with spectra derived using Mie-scattering theory for single (Lee et al.,21\n2003) and dual (Kim et al., 2006) phase PSCs. Using this method they were22\nable to determine, within uncertainties of 25\u201340%, PSC compositions and ef-23\nfective particle radii.24\nOther limb-sounding instruments, mounted on balloons and satellites, have25\nbeen also been used to detect PSCs. These instruments scan the atmosphere26\n8\nabove the horizon in a similar manner to solar occultation photometers, but1\nare not orientated towards the Sun. Instead they measure the scattering of2\nupwelling tropospheric radiation into the limb view, or the thermal infrared3\nemission from the troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere. These methods4\nare particularly well suited to PSC studies because they allow measurements5\nto be taken over a greater latitudinal range than the solar occultation method,6\nand also at night (and so within the winter polar regions).7\nSpang et al. (2001) verified a robust cloud detection method of using the ratio8\nof radiances in the wavenumber ranges of 788\u2013796 cm\u22121 and 832\u2013834 cm\u22121,9\nwhich are respectively dominated by CO2 and aerosol\/cloud emissions. Spang10\net al. (2005) applied this method to the analysis of MIPAS on ENVISAT11\ndata, validating the measurements using lidar and satellite data (POAM III12\nand SAGE III). They found that the agreement between the MIPAS and li-13\ndar data was very good. The agreement with the other satellite data was also14\ngood, although the solar occultation measurements were able to detect op-15\ntically thinner clouds than the MIPAS measurements. Spang and Remedios16\n(2003) identified a spectral signal at 820 cm\u22121 which they concluded indi-17\ncates the presence of particles with a high HNO3 concentration (mass fraction18\n> 40%). Ho\u00a8pfner et al. (2006) extended this analysis using refractive indices19\ngenerated from a number of laboratory studies to generate profiles for the ma-20\njor PSC particle compositions. Using lidar measurements for validation, they21\ndemonstrated that dense homogeneous clouds of ice or small (radii < 3\u00b5m)22\nNAT particles can be identified using MIPAS measurements.23\nSatellite-based instruments are important because they allow us to observe24\nlarge volumes of the atmosphere over several years, so an overview of strato-25\nspheric conditions, and estimations of the extent of PSC coverage, can be26\n9\nmade. However, until recently, they could not be used to determine any phys-1\nical parameters of the aerosols being observed. Even with the information2\nprovided by the analysis of extra wavelengths of solar radiation, Strawa et al.3\n(2002) have only been able to distinguish differences in the size of the aerosol4\nparticles, and so indirectly determine the type of PSC observed. Because of5\nthe scale of these measurements \u2014 a typical POAM sample volume is about6\n200 km long, 30 km wide and 1 km thick \u2014 these datasets do not capture well7\nsmall-scale features.8\n2.3 Mesoscale Instruments9\nMost remote measurements of PSCs are made using lidar systems, which,10\nunlike passive sensors, contain a laser source as well as an optical sensor. The11\nlaser is aimed towards the area of interest, while the sensor detects the light12\nthat scatters at 180\u00b0, i.e., directly back towards the instrument. The distance13\nbetween the lidar and the measurement site is calculated from the time the14\nsignal takes to return.15\nTwo properties of the returned signal are measured, the amount of backscat-16\ntered light and its polarisation, from which are determined the backscatter17\nand aerosol depolarisation ratios. The scattering ratio, S, is the ratio of the18\ntotal backscatter to the backscatter due to air molecules alone. The ratio of19\nthe aerosol backscatter to the molecular backscatter is given by S \u2212 1. The20\ntotal depolarisation ratio, DT , is the ratio of the perpendicular backscatter21\nreturn, R\u22a5, to the parallel backscatter return, R\u201622\nDT =\nR\u22a5\nR\u2016\n. (1)\n23\n10\nThe aerosol depolarisation ratio is (Browell et al., 1990)1\nDa = DT\nS\u2016(S\u22a5 \u2212 1)\nS\u22a5(S\u2016 \u2212 1) , (2)2\nwhere S\u22a5 and S\u2016 are the the scattering ratios for the perpendicular and parallel3\nreturns, respectively.4\nLidar measurements can be made using a single laser wavelength (e.g., see5\nPoole and McCormick, 1988; Gobbi et al., 1998; Santacesaria et al., 2001),6\nhowever the amount of information that can be gleaned from the data is7\ngreatly increased if two or more wavelengths of light are used (Browell et al.,8\n1990). This allows the use of the colour ratio9\nC(\u03bb2, \u03bb1) =\nS(\u03bb2)\u2212 1\nS(\u03bb1)\u2212 1 . (3)10\nTwo typical wavelengths used for lidar studies are \u03bb2 = 1.064 \u00b5m and \u03bb1 =11\n0.603 \u00b5m. The wavelength dependence of the aerosol backscatter is assumed to12\nbe proportional to \u03bb\u2212\u03b1, while molecular scattering is proportional to \u03bb\u22124. Thus13\nthe wavelength dependence of the aerosol backscatter ratio is proportional to14\n\u03bb4\u2212\u03b1. The aerosol backscatter wavelength dependence parameter \u03b1 is given by15\n\u03b1 = 4\u2212 ln (C(\u03bb2, \u03bb1))\nln (\u03bb2\/\u03bb1)\n, (4)\n16\nand is size dependent. A large \u03b1 indicates that a majority of particles have17\nradii smaller than the lidar wavelengths, while a small \u03b1 indicates that the18\nmajority of particles have radii larger than the lidar wavelengths (Toon et al.,19\n2000; Shibata et al., 1997).20\nThe aerosol backscatter depends on the particle size distribution, particularly21\nthe surface area density, and the particle refractive index, as well as the lidar22\n11\nwavelength. The amount of depolarisation occurring depends on the shape of1\nthe particles. It is small for molecular scattering, and zero for spherical parti-2\ncles, but will occur with even slight departures from spherical shapes. While3\nMie scattering theory can be used to analyse PSCs consisting of spherical4\nparticles (e.g., see Toon et al., 2000), detailed analysis of lidar observations of5\nmany PSCs is difficult because they consist of nonspherical solid particles with6\nsizes comparable to the wavelength of the laser. Theoretical modelling can aid7\nanalysis; however this must be done by solving the Maxwell equations using8\nnumerical techniques (see Liu and Mishchenko, 2001, and references within).9\nAnalysis of lidar data requires knowledge of the purely-molecular backscatter10\n(Browell et al., 1990); lidar measurements are often normalised, therefore, at a11\nhigh altitude where the signal is assumed to be from molecules alone. However,12\nas discussed by Toon et al. (2000), stratospheric aerosols are ubiquitous, and13\nso data used for normalisation may not be purely molecular. They also noted14\nthat aerosol scattering is often not much larger than molecular scattering,15\nand so only considered data for which S(0.603) > 1.2 and S(1.064) > 2.0 to16\ncontain PSCs.17\nUsing the method described above, Browell et al. (1990) identified the exis-18\ntence of two different types of aerosols above the water ice frost point, Types19\nIa and Ib, and produced a lidar-based classification (Table 1). Toon et al.20\n(1990) used these observations to describe several physical parameters of Type21\nI clouds. The value of \u03b1 puts limits on the particle size: large values (Type Ib)22\nindicated particles with mode radii less than the laser wavelength, i.e. about23\n0.5\u00b5m. Smaller \u03b1 values (Type Ia) limit the mode radii of the observed par-24\nticles to 1\u00b5m or greater. The amount of depolarisation indicates the shape25\nof the particles: the very low depolarisation of the Type Ib particles suggests26\n12\nthat they are almost spherical, while the higher values for the Type Ia particles1\nindicates that they are much less spherical. The backscatter ratio can be used2\nto calculate the total volume concentration of particles. The high value for the3\nType Ib particles indicates that they have a large volume concentration, and4\nare likely to have taken up most of the atmospheric HNO3. Conversely, Type Ia5\nparticles are likely to have a small total volume concentration. However some6\nnon-spherical particles scatter much less efficiently than spheres at 180\u00b0 so this7\nrelationship is less clear cut. Although work has been done on characterising8\nthe lidar response to non-spherical particles (Liu and Mishchenko, 2001) and9\naerosols composed of a number of different particle shapes (Reichardt et al.,10\n2002), this is still a complicated and uncertain field.11\nLidar measurements do not provide the compositions of the particles that they12\ndetect. To deduce PSC composition, von Ko\u00a8nig et al. (2002) combined lidar13\nmeasurements of PSCs with gas-phase HNO3 measurements from the Air-14\nbourne Submillimeter Radiometer (ASUR). The ASUR instrument measures15\nradiation at wavelengths of about 0.5 mm, large enough to not be affected by16\nscatter from stratospheric particles, so in the stratosphere the signal is only17\ninfluenced by absorption by gaseous molecules. By combining the gas-phase18\nHNO3 measurements with temperature and H2O data, and lidar observations19\nof PSCs, von Ko\u00a8nig et al. (2002) were able to conclude that the observations20\nin the Arctic on one particular day were consistent with a NAT composition.21\nThese observations are limited by the ASUR instrument, which has a vertical22\nresolution of 6\u201310 km, a horizontal resolution of about 20 km, and a precision23\nof about 0.3 ppb in the lower stratosphere (see von Ko\u00a8nig et al., 2002, and24\nreferences within). This resolution is good enough for synoptic-scale PSCs,25\nbut would not be able to distinguish the thin layering (50\u2013300m thick) which26\n13\nhas been observed within mesoscale PSCs (Hofmann, 1990).1\nRemote-sensing instruments can provide measurements of particle shapes and2\nsizes as well as of the total aerosol volume concentration. Combining these3\nwith measurements of gas-phase constituents and standard stratospheric num-4\nber densities allows particle compositions and size distributions to be inferred.5\nHowever, these measurements are limited by low spatial resolution. For testing6\nmicrophysical models, the lack of direct composition information is a disad-7\nvantage of lidar measurements, but the detailed spatial information is a great8\nadvantage (e.g., Tsias et al., 1999; Wirth et al., 1999).9\n2.4 In-situ Instruments10\nIn-situ instruments cannot provide the same large-scale coverage as remote11\nsensing instruments. However, they do often provide a higher spatial resolu-12\ntion, ca. 100-500m horizontally, allowing the study of small-scale features. To13\nget these instruments up to the stratosphere they can be mounted either on14\nballoons (e.g., Hofmann and Deshler, 1990; Schreiner et al., 2003) or high-15\naltitude aircraft, such as the American ER-2 (e.g., Dye et al., 1992; Northway16\net al., 2002) and the Russian M-55 Geophysica (e.g., Stefanutti et al., 1999).17\nThese platforms have different advantages and disadvantages. Aircraft are very18\nflexible, allowing focused studies of small-scale features. However they have a19\nlimited range. Balloons have a potentially far greater range than aircraft, and20\nfollow near-lagrangian flight paths, enabling the study of the evolution of air21\nparcels in time. However they can carry fewer instruments, have limited op-22\ntions for steering, and can only be launched when ground-level weather is near23\ncalm.24\n14\nThe in-situ instruments most similar to the remote-sensing instruments de-1\nscribed above are the backscatter sondes. Backscatter sondes are like lidar2\nbut without range detection (i.e. all the backscattered photons from a flash3\nare counted together), and are used to study particles within about 50 metres4\nof the platform. These use backscatter, depolarisation and colour ratios to5\nmeasure particle shapes and total aerosol volume concentrations in the same6\nway as the lidar systems described above (e.g., see Schreiner et al., 2003; Lowe7\net al., 2006, and references within).8\nOptical particle counters, such as the Multiangle Spectrometer Probe (MASP)9\nand Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe (FSSP), are used to measure the10\nnumber density and size distribution of the aerosol population. These instru-11\nments measure the scattered light produced when individual particles pass12\nthrough a beam of light (which can be either a laser or white light). The13\ninlets of instruments mounted on aircraft are orientated so that the atmo-14\nsphere can be passively sampled using the movement of the aircraft, allow-15\ning the particles to be measured under near-ambient conditions. Instruments16\nmounted on balloons cannot do this, and so must use pumps to collect sam-17\nples. Light is scattered in all directions by the particles. All instruments collect18\nthe strong forward-scattered signal, though some instruments also collect the19\nweaker back-scattered signal (e.g. MASP, see Drdla et al., 2003, and references20\nwithin). Mie scattering theory is used to calculate particle sizes, with the as-21\nsumption that the sampled particles are spherical. In addition, a standard22\nrefractive index must be used, usually set to a value between 1.40\u20131.45, based23\non an estimation of the average refractive index of stratospheric aerosols. These24\ninstruments can typically resolve particles between \u223c 0.2\u00b5m and \u223c 20\u00b5m in25\nsize. It is also possible to obtain particle number densities. The main limiting26\n15\nfactors on accuracy are uncertainties associated with the sample volume. A1\nstatistically significant sample needs to be about 100 particles or more, so2\nsample volumes need to be large to measure the diffuse aerosols present in3\nthe stratosphere. This means that sample times can to be up to 2 minutes,4\nresulting in a spatial resolution of 10\u201320 km for aircraft mounted instruments5\n(Baumgardner et al., 1992).6\nA chemiluminescence detector for gas-phase NOy and NO has been mounted7\non the ER-2 for polar missions since the late 1980s (Fahey et al., 1989). NOy8\nis the sum of all nitrogen oxides excluding N2O, i.e., NO, NO2, HNO3, etc. In9\nthe wintertime lower stratosphere, the majority of NOy is HNO3. Recently the10\ninstrument has been adapted for measuring large HNO3-containing particles11\n(Northway et al., 2002). This instrument, which has subsequently been dupli-12\ncated on the Geophysica (Voigt et al., 2005), has two inlets. The front inlet13\nmeasures the NOy and NO content of the gas-phase and all sizes of particles.14\nThe rear inlet makes use of particle inertia to avoid sampling any particles15\nlarger than 2\u00b5m aerodynamic diameter. Subisokinetic inlets are used \u2014 the16\ninternal flow rates are constant and lower than the true speed of the air-17\ncraft \u2014 which enhance particle number concentrations within the instrument.18\nThe factor of enhancement can be calculated using fluid dynamics simula-19\ntions (Northway et al., 2002), and increases with increasing particle size. By20\nsubtracting the NOy measurement of the rear inlet from that of the front in-21\nlet the NOy content of the large (> 2\u00b5m) particles can be measured. When22\nthese particles are collected at a lower frequency than the sampling rate (1Hz)23\nthen individual particles can be identified. The size of the individual particles24\ncan be calculated using their net NOy content and assuming a set chemical25\ncomposition (usually NAT).26\n16\nThe compositions of smaller particles can be measured using the balloon1\nmounted Aerosol Composition Mass Spectrometer (ACMS) (Schreiner et al.,2\n2002). In stratospheric conditions this instrument has a throughput of around3\n15 cm3 s\u22121. The sampled air passes through an aerodynamic lens \u2014 which4\nconcentrates particles within the size range 0.3\u20135\u00b5m into a narrow beam \u20145\ninto two vacuum chambers which reduce the air pressure in two steps down to6\n10\u22128mbar, used to produce an enhanced aerosol-to-gas signal ratio within the7\nmass spectrometer. Particles take about 0.5 ms to pass through the vacuum8\nchambers. Model calculations and experimental results show that the change9\nin composition of particles larger than 0.1\u00b5m during this time is negligible10\n(Schreiner et al., 2002). From the vacuum chambers the aerosol beam passes11\ninto an evaporation sphere, which is heated to 80\u0089. Finally the majority of12\nthe resulting gas enters the mass spectrometer to be measured, while approx-13\nimately 30% of the particle mass is lost back to the vacuum chamber. The14\nbackground signal of the instrument due to the remaining part of the gas-phase15\ncan be determined by moving the focus of the lens away from the evaporation16\nsphere, stopping any particles from entering the sphere and so being measured.17\nThe relative count rates of the different chemical species measured, typically18\nH2O and HNO3, allowing particle composition to be determined. However the19\nsizes and number of particles measured cannot be reliably determined due to20\nthe mixing of the signals from different particles and the loss of mass from the21\nevaporating sphere.22\n17\n3 Particle Compositions1\nSince the discovery of PSCs, a number of different types of particles have2\nbe postulated as as being important in the formation and lifecycles of these3\naerosols. Observations of PSCs have been split into Types Ia, Ib and II based4\non classifications of lidar measurements (Poole and McCormick, 1988; Toon5\net al., 1990). However these divisions are based on the optical parameters6\nof the aerosols, which, while providing an idea of typical shapes and sizes7\nof particles, contain very little information about the actual composition of8\nthe particles. Below we will discuss the current ideas on the compositions of,9\nand transitions between, the different types of PSC particles. The broad lidar10\nclassifications will be used to provide a loose structure; however on occasions11\nwe will stray outside these limits.12\n3.1 Type Ib particles13\nBecause of their particle sizes and shapes, Type Ib PSCs are believed to consist14\nmostly of STS droplets. These are formed by the condensational growth of the15\nbackground stratospheric aerosol, which is comprised of binary H2SO4\/H2O16\nparticles (Rosen, 1971). The amount of sulphuric acid in the condensed phase17\nincreases significantly as the temperature decreases from \u223c 240 to \u223c 210K18\n(Figure 5). For temperatures of 200K and below it can be assumed that all19\nthe sulphuric acid is in the condensed phase. This makes changes in the com-20\npositions of the binary particles easier to calculate, because only transport21\nof water from\/to the vapour phase need be considered. The mass fraction of22\nH2SO4 in the droplets decreases with decreasing temperature, because of the23\n18\nextra water vapour which is taken up by the particles. The first parameteri-1\nsation for the composition and volume of stratospheric H2SO4\/H2O aerosols2\nwas developed by Steele and Hamill (1981).3\nThere are several other gaseous species which will dissolve into the strato-4\nspheric H2SO4\/H2O droplets, including the halogen \u201creservoir\u201d species: HCl,5\nHBr, HOCl and HOBr. Halogen compounds may react in the liquid aerosol6\nto release photochemically active species which catalytically destroy ozone7\n(Solomon, 1990, 1999). Thermodynamical models have been developed to8\nmodel the equilibrium properties of liquid stratospheric droplets (e.g. Carslaw9\net al., 1994; Cox et al., 1994; Tabazadeh et al., 1994). The models show a10\nrapid change in particle composition about 4\u20135K above the ice frost point,11\nfrom almost binary H2SO4\/H2O solutions to almost binary HNO3\/H2O so-12\nlutions (Figure 6). At these temperatures, the majority of HCl and HBr in13\nthe system transfers to the condensed-phase (Fig. 6a). However these species14\nare much less abundant than HNO3, and so are only minor constituents of15\ndroplets (Fig. 6b).16\nParticles do not always maintain equilibrium with the atmosphere. For ex-17\nample, Peter et al. (1994) noted that NAT particles take several hours to18\nre-equilibrate with the gas-phase after undergoing a rapid change in condi-19\ntions. In the case of crystalline particles, such as NAT or SAT, with a fixed20\ncomposition, this process merely entails a change in the mass of the particle.21\nLiquid particles, on the other hand, do not have a fixed composition. Thus, in22\ntheory, they can adopt very different compositions during this re-equilibrium23\nprocess from that which would be the case if equilibrium was maintained. Us-24\ning a microphysical model, Meilinger et al. (1995) investigated the behaviour25\nof an ensemble of STS droplets subjected to rapid temperature changes. They26\n19\nfound that, during rapid cooling, the majority of the particles in the distribu-1\ntion would not take up HNO3 rapidly enough to remain in equilibrium with2\nthe atmosphere. The resulting increase in the HNO3 saturation ratio allows3\nthe smallest particles to overcome the Kelvin effect and rapidly grow, gaining4\na far higher HNO3 mass fraction than would otherwise occur (Figure 7). The5\nhysteresis effect observed in the evolution of the HNO3 mass fraction occurs6\nbecause HNO3 is a factor of \u223c500 less abundant than H2O in the stratosphere.7\nThe time taken for a particle constituent to regain equilibrium with the gas-8\nphase is dependent on the particle size and partial pressure of the constituent.9\nThus, after an infinitesimal temperature change, the time taken for HNO3 in10\na particle to regain equilibrium with the gas-phase is 7 hr and 10min, for par-11\nticles of radius 2 and 0.1\u00b5m, respectively. For H2O the time lag decreases to12\n29 s and 0.7 s, respectively (Meilinger et al., 1995).13\nFigure 8 demonstrates the importance of non-equilibrium compositions. The14\ndata shown (diamonds) are from a balloon flight from Kiruna, Sweden, on 2515\nJanuary 1998 (Schreiner et al., 1999), and show HNO3 : H2O mole ratios from16\nmass-spectrometer measurements in a PSC. The data clearly do not fall on the17\nequilibrium STS composition, even considering a range of possible gas-phase18\nabundances of HNO3. Using a non-equilibrium model for the growth of the19\nliquid PSC droplets (Lowe et al., 2003) captures much more of the observed20\nvariability on composition. As expected from the relaxation time arguments,21\nabove, the non-equilibrium particles are usually deficient in HNO3, by up22\nto a factor of three at T \u2212 Tice \u2248 4K, for example. Such disequilibrium in23\nmountain-wave PSCs has also been observed in aircraft measurements (Lowe24\net al., 2006).25\nSAT particles are not directly related to observations of Type Ib PSCs; they26\n20\nare, however, the thermodynamically stable form of H2SO4\/H2O particles be-1\ntween 188\u2013213K (Koop and Carslaw, 1996). Thus we must consider their pos-2\nsible effects on the growth of STS droplets from the background sulphate par-3\nticles. SAT is a crystalline solid with the chemical composition H2SO4 \u00b74H2O.4\nIt is part of a broad family of crystalline sulphuric acid hydrates, which5\nincludes the monohydrate, SAM (H2SO4 \u00b7H2O), the hemihexahydrate, SAH6\n(H2SO4 \u00b76.5H2O) and and the octahydrate, SAO (H2SO4 \u00b78H2O).7\nKoop and Carslaw (1996) studied the stability conditions for H2SO4 solid8\nphases by comparing the composition of stratospheric H2SO4\/H2O droplets9\nwith the melting points of the different solid phases (Figure 9). A useful mea-10\nsure of the stability of the solid phases is their saturation ratios in an atmo-11\nsphere of the relevant composition. When these are greater than 1 then the12\nsolid is stable, less than 1 and the solid is unstable. From Figure 9B we would13\ndeduce that SAT particles form ice particles below 188K (point c). Figure 9A14\nalso suggests that SAT particles should change to different solid phases when15\nthe temperature increases above point (a). However, laboratory experiments16\nhave shown that SAT will melt rather than change to a different solid phase17\nwhen warmed above 210\u2013215K (Middlebrook et al., 1993).18\nAs discussed above, liquid stratospheric aerosols absorb large amounts of19\nHNO3 at low temperatures (Zhang et al., 1993; Molina et al., 1993), which will20\nchange the behaviour of stratospheric SAT particles when cooled. The stability21\nof dry SAT particles can be determined by examining the saturation ratio in22\nliquid droplets with the same composition as SAT under the same atmospheric23\nconditions (Figure 10). The addition of HNO3 to the system significantly re-24\nduces the stability of SAT, which deliquesces simply because it is less thermo-25\ndynamically stable than STS. However experimental results (Iraci et al., 1998)26\n21\nindicate that this process may be kinetically limited. Only \u223c 60% of SAT sam-1\nples subjected to conditions below the critical temperature of deliquescence2\n(point 1 in Figure 10) exhibited SAT loss to form HNO3\/H2SO4\/H2O solution.3\nThe composition and stability conditions for SAT, as well as its phase tran-4\nsitions to aqueous H2SO4 and HNO3 solutions, are well known. However the5\nformation routes for SAT are more obscure. Laboratory experiments (Middle-6\nbrook et al., 1993; Beyer et al., 1994; Koop et al., 1997b) have not observed the7\nhomogeneous nucleation of SAT above the ice point, which, with the addition8\nof an analysis of nucleation statistics (Koop et al., 1997b), suggests that sul-9\nphate aerosols do not freeze homogeneously to form sulphuric acid hydrates.10\nLaboratory experiments (Bogdan et al., 2003) also found that concentrated11\n(>40wt% H2SO4) sulphate droplets will not heterogeneously freeze on sil-12\nica particles at stratospheric temperatures. It has been suggested that liquid13\nH2SO4\/H2O droplets may behave like glassy solids below \u223c 194K and crys-14\ntallize upon warming to form SAT (Tabazadeh et al., 1995). However Koop15\net al. (1997b) showed that the rate of crystal growth is such that stratospheric16\naerosol droplets would freeze as soon as nucleation has occurred. In labora-17\ntory work, SAT is formed using supercooling, a process which invariably also18\nproduces water ice. Thus it is likely that SAT heterogeneously nucleates on19\nother crystalline solids in the stratosphere; however no studies of nucleation20\nrates have been made.21\n3.2 Type II particles22\nType II PSCs were identified as consisting of large (\u226510\u00b5m) crystalline parti-23\ncles which only exist below the stratospheric ice frost point of \u223c188K (Poole24\n22\nand McCormick, 1988). The obvious choice of composition for these particles1\nis water ice (Turco et al., 1989). However, because these ice crystals nucleate2\nfrom HNO3-rich particles, the compositions and lifecycles of these particles3\nmust be more complicated than those of pure H2O ice crystals.4\nThree routes of ice formation have been suggested: vapour deposition of ice5\nonto either SAT or NAT, homogeneous nucleation from an aqueous solu-6\ntion, and heterogeneous nucleation in aqueous solutions containing solid cores.7\nVapour deposition of ice onto NAT particles was postulated as a method of8\nformation for Type II particles while the three-stage model of PSC forma-9\ntion was in favour (e.g. Hanson and Mauersberger, 1988; Peter et al., 1991).10\nHowever no studies have been made into this route of formation. Recent ex-11\nperimental work into the vapour deposition of ice on to SAT has observed ice12\nformation at supercoolings of \u2264 1K below the ice frost point (Fortin et al.,13\n2003). However this route would require the existence of SAT below its deli-14\nquescence temperature. This may occur for up to \u223c40% of the available SAT15\nparticles (Iraci et al., 1998), but is more likely when the majority of the avail-16\nable HNO3 has been taken up into NAT particles (lowering the deliquescence17\ntemperature).18\nWith the addition of STS to the list of possible PSC particles, the homo-19\ngeneous nucleation of ice from STS was proposed. Laboratory experiments20\nwith solutions such as H2SO4\/H2O, HNO3\/H2O and HNO3\/H2SO4\/H2O have21\nshown that homogeneous nucleation of ice requires the solution to be super-22\ncooled 2\u20133K below the ice frost point (e.g., Chang et al., 1999; Koop et al.,23\n1998; Middlebrook et al., 1993). Theoretical studies, using classical homoge-24\nneous freezing theory, are consistent with this (MacKenzie et al., 1995, 1997,25\n1998). Using experimental data Koop et al. (2000) developed a thermody-26\n23\nnamic scheme for homogeneous ice nucleation, expressed as a function of the1\nwater activity and pressure. These experiments and theories have assumed2\nthat the ice nuclei would form within the interior volume of the droplet. How-3\never Tabazadeh et al. (2002b) proposed that the gas-liquid interface may be4\nimportant for homogeneous freezing of atmospheric droplets. The relative im-5\nportance of surface- and volume-based nucleation within their scheme depends6\non the temperature and size of the droplet. Smaller droplets are more likely7\nto undergo surface nucleation, while lowering the temperature increases the8\nlikelihood of volume-based nucleation occurring. A recent laboratory study9\n(Duft and Leisner, 2004) has demonstrated that homogeneous freezing in wa-10\nter droplets with radii 19\u201349\u00b5m is volume-based, although further study is11\nrequired to discover if this is true for smaller droplets. Computational simula-12\ntions (Vrbka and Jungwirth, 2006) suggest that, during homogeneous freezing,13\nice nuclei are more likely to form within the sub-surface region. They suggest14\nthis is because the change in volume associated with freezing is more easily15\naccommodated near the surface than in the bulk of the liquid. However, the16\ndisorder of the immediate liquid surface is not conducive to crystal formation.17\nLiquid PSC particles are not pure water, so the water droplet simulations are18\nnot directly applicable to PSCs, and it has been noted that the surface of an19\naqueous particle is often enriched with chemical components such as nitric20\nacid, making it more difficult for an ice nucleus to form at the surface of such21\na particle (see Tabazadeh et al., 2002b, and references within).22\nTheoretical work on heterogeneous nucleation of ice particles from aqueous23\nsolutions in the troposphere suggests that this process could be important for24\nthe formation of cirrus clouds in the northern hemisphere (e.g., see Gierens,25\n2003, and references within). However, the total abundance of condensation26\n24\nnuclei is far less in the lower stratosphere, 10\u201360 cm\u22123, than in the upper tro-1\nposphere, 600\u20131600 cm\u22123 (Sheridan et al., 1994), and it is believed that only2\na fraction of these are likely to act as ice nuclei. From this we might infer3\nthat heterogeneous ice nucleation is less relevant in the stratosphere, although4\nrecent laboratory experiments have shown that fumed silica can act as a nu-5\ncleus for the heterogeneous freezing of ice from dilute (\u223c 7% HNO3) nitric acid6\nsolutions (Bogdan et al., 2003). Since fumed silica is similar in composition,7\nand method of formation, to meteoritic smoke particles, then these particles,8\nwhich have a number concentration of 100 cm\u22123 in the stratosphere, could act9\nas heterogeneous nuclei for ice particles (see Bogdan et al., 2003, and references10\nwithin).11\nThe equilibrium partitioning of H2O between the solid and gas phases for a12\nwater ice particle can be calculated using, for example, the empirical equation13\nderived by Marti and Mauersberger (1993). STS particles are, however, not14\ncomposed purely of water, and so the ice freezing process must take account15\nof the other chemical constituents of the droplet. One possibility is that the16\nother components of the droplet, in this case mostly HNO3 and H2SO4, could17\nsimply be adsorbed onto the surface of the ice particle as it grows, and become18\nembedded in the ice matrix without forming hydrates. However the thermo-19\ndynamic solubilities of HNO3 and H2SO4 in ice are of the order of parts per20\nmillion (Davy and Somorjai, 1971), at least five orders of magnitude less than21\ntheir mixing ratios in PSCs. Instead it is likely that the remaining part of the22\noriginal STS will form either solid NAT\/SAT or a liquid STS layer on the23\nsurface of the ice particle.24\nUsing the thermodynamic model of Carslaw et al. (1995), Koop et al. (1997a)25\ninvestigated the stabilities of the different possible PSC phases. They found26\n25\nthat liquid solutions can co-exist with both NAT and ice, provided that H2SO41\nremains in the aqueous phase. Liquids in equilibrium with a solid phase con-2\nsisting just of ice contain \u223c 40wt% HNO3 and trace H2SO4, whilst equilib-3\nrium with NAT would result in a H2SO4-rich solution. Liquids in equilibrium4\nwith SAT would have HNO3 vapour pressures in excess of the total available5\nHNO3, and so are thermodynamically unfeasible. So a Type II particle is likely6\nto consist of a combination of different chemical phases, with typically combi-7\nnations being: ice\/STS, ice\/NAT\/STS (almost binary H2SO4\/H2O solution),8\nand ice\/NAT\/SAT.9\n3.3 Type Ia particles10\nType Ia particles are classified as medium-sized (\u22651\u00b5m) aspherical parti-11\ncles, which can exist several degrees above the ice frost point (Toon et al.,12\n1990). Their aspherical shape implies that they are solid particles, most likely13\nnitric-acid hydrates. Experimental work by Hanson and Mauersberger (1988)14\ndemonstrated that the stable nitric-acid hydrate under stratospheric condi-15\ntions is nitric acid trihydrate (NAT, HNO3 \u00b73H2O, \u223c54wt% HNO3), which16\ncan exist up to about 7K above the ice frost point. Later experiments by17\nWorsnop et al. (1993) showed that other nitric-acid hydrates are metastable18\nunder stratospheric conditions (Figure 11). They suggested that nitric acid19\ndihydrate (NAD, HNO3 \u00b72H2O, \u223c64wt% HNO3) would form readily in the20\nstratosphere and could persist for several days; a conclusion which is sup-21\nported by recent studies into NAD crystalline structures and formation routes22\n(Natsheh et al., 2006). This tendency to nucleate metastable phases may in-23\ndicate a relatively high free-energy barrier for nucleation of NAT compared24\n26\nwith other crystalline nitric-acid hydrates (Worsnop et al., 1993). Although1\nthe existence of nitric-acid hydrates in the polar winter stratosphere has been2\nknown to be possible since the mid-1980s, it has only been recently that direct3\nin-situ measurements of particle compositions have confirmed the existence of4\nNAT particles in the stratosphere (Voigt et al., 2000a). No direct stratospheric5\nmeasurements of NAD particles have been made.6\nAs with stratospheric ice particles, there have been three routes of formation7\nsuggested for HNO3 hydrates: vapour deposition onto either ice or SAT, ho-8\nmogeneous nucleation from an aqueous solution, and heterogeneous nucleation9\nin aqueous solutions containing solid cores. The original three-stage model of10\nPSC formation implied that NAT would nucleate directly from the gas-phase11\non to SAT particles. However, theoretical studies cast doubt on this mech-12\nanism (MacKenzie et al., 1995), and laboratory studies (Iraci et al., 1995)13\nshowed that the formation of NAT on SAT is strongly hindered up to NAT14\nsaturation ratios of 127, implying that this process is kinetically very unlikely15\nin the stratosphere. A possible exception to this is when SAT surfaces have16\nbeen primed for NAT nucleation by a previous deposition-and-evaporation cy-17\ncle of NAT on the surface (Zhang et al., 1996). This process could occur in18\nthe stratosphere for SAT particles which originally formed as part of a multi-19\nphase particle which included NAT, but the formation route for these particles20\nis uncertain. In addition, the NAT saturation ratios needed for deposition onto21\nSAT occur below the deliquescence temperature of SAT in the stratosphere.22\nBulk freezing experiments (Koop et al., 1997b) showed that the nucleation of23\nNAT from binary HNO3\/H2O solutions containing ice particles occurred faster24\nif the ice particles had passed through the gas-phase first. Koop et al. (1997b)25\ninterpreted this to mean that NAT\/NAD had nucleated heterogeneously from26\n27\nthe gas phase on to the ice particles while they were sedimenting. When the1\ncrystals reached the liquid they seeded NAT and ice formation in the binary2\nsolution. The nucleation of NAT by vapour deposition onto ice surfaces has3\nbeen observed at high NAT supersaturations (Biermann et al., 1998; Middle-4\nbrook et al., 1996). Modelling studies (Luo et al., 2003) have suggested that5\nrapid cooling within gravity waves would suppress the growth of STS parti-6\ncles, allowing the development of large NAT saturation ratios in parallel with7\nthe growth of ice particles (Figure 12). This could result in the nucleation of8\nNAT onto the ice particles, which would then persist as NAT particles after9\nthe ice had evaporated away (Luo et al., 2003).10\nThe most direct method of NAT formation would be homogeneous freezing11\nfrom STS droplets. However there are severe limitations. Bulk freezing experi-12\nments (Koop et al., 1995, 1997b) demonstrated that the presence of \u22650.1wt%13\nH2SO4 would lower the freezing temperatures of HNO3\/H2SO4\/H2O solutions14\nby \u226510K below those typical of HNO3\/H2O solutions. Bertram et al. (1996);15\nDisselkamp et al. (1996), and Bertram and Sloan (1998) found somewhat dif-16\nferent results while studying the freezing of 1:2 (HNO3:H2O molar ratio) nitric17\nacid aerosol droplets to NAD. Freezing in the experiments of Disselkamp et al.18\n(1996) produced NAD much more easily from solutions with a HNO3:H2O19\nmolar ratio of 1:2 than NAT from solutions with a molar ratio of 1:3 (the20\nnucleation rates differ by a factor of 103 or more). Freezing temperatures in21\nthe experiments of Bertram et al. (1996); Bertram and Sloan (1998) were22\nsome 20 K below those in the Disselkamp et al. (1996) experiments. It is not23\nclear why these experimental results are so different. Classical freezing theory24\n\u2014 that is also consistent with NAT, SAT, and ice freezing experiments \u201425\nis consistent with the Bertram et al. (1996); Bertram and Sloan (1998) re-26\n28\nsults (MacKenzie et al., 1998). Subsequent empirical fits to laboratory results1\n(Mo\u00a8hler et al., 2006) fit the results of the most recent study (Stetzer et al.,2\n2006) and those of the earlier studies, using a fitted version of classical freezing3\ntheory.4\nAs discussed previously, Meilinger et al. (1995) suggested that these limitations5\nmight be overcome during the rapid changes in conditions which occur within6\ngravity waves. However the maximum HNO3 mass fraction they reported was7\n\u223c52% in cooling rates of up to 36Khr\u22121, which is close to the NAT stoi-8\nchiometry, but not that of NAD. Tsias et al. (1997) expanded on this work,9\nexamining the effect of faster temperature changes on the droplet composi-10\ntions. They found that particles could reach HNO3 mass fractions of \u223c58%11\n(\u223c1:2.5 HNO3\/H2O) during warming at rates of \u2265100Khr\u22121 (temperature12\nchange rates in stratospheric mountain wave events can be up to 150Khr\u22121,13\ne.g. see Tsias et al., 1997, and references within). They demonstrated ex-14\nperimentally that binary HNO3\/H2O droplets of similar compositions would15\nfreeze to NAD typically within one hour. During mountain wave events, how-16\never, such compositions are only achieved for a few minutes, so only a small17\nfraction of the droplets at such compositions (which would be a small fraction18\nof the total aerosol population) would freeze.19\nExperimental studies of binary HNO3\/H2O droplet freezing (Salcedo et al.,20\n2000, 2001) were extrapolated linearly to stratospheric conditions and used21\nto hypothesise a \u201cnucleation window\u201d for the production of NAD (Tabazadeh22\net al., 2001). Such a linear extrapolation is forbidden by thermodynamics23\n(Knopf et al., 2002) and particle production rates (for NAT and NAD) are24\nmuch smaller than those predicted by Tabazadeh et al. (2001) (Figure 13b).25\n29\nWhile all of the studies above have assumed that homogeneous nucleation1\nwould occur within the bulk of a liquid, other work (Tabazadeh et al., 2002a,b)2\nhas proposed surface-based nucleation. In this process, the nucleating solid3\nreduces the energy needed to form a stable crystal by forming part of its4\nsurface out of the liquid, in contact with the gas-phase. This method is only5\nfavoured in cases where the solid is partially (but not fully) wettable by its6\nown liquid melt. Tabazadeh et al. (2002a) re-analysed data from laboratory7\nstudies of the freezing of NAT and NAD from binary HNO3\/H2O solutions8\nusing a formulation for surface-based nucleation. They found that the for-9\nmulation for surface nucleation fitted the data better than the volume-based10\nformulation and is, at least in the case of NAD nucleation, less temperature11\ndependent. A comparison of atmospheric NAD production rates derived using12\nthe two formulations (Figure 14), show that the surface-based production rate13\nis \u223c 102 greater than the volume-based production rate used in their earlier14\nwork (Tabazadeh et al., 2001). Applying the factor of 102 to the stratospheric15\nproduction rate of NAD of Knopf et al. (2002) (as shown in Figure 13b) we16\nonly obtain a production rate of \u223c10\u221211 cm\u22123 hr\u22121. This is still much smaller17\nthan the production rates of 10\u22125 cm\u22123 hr\u22121 that microphysical sensitivity18\nstudies suggest are needed for homogeneous nucleation to have a significant19\ninfluence on the overall number of HNO3-hydrate particles in the stratosphere20\n(Tabazadeh et al., 2001). Recently Stetzer et al. (2006) have demonstrated21\nthat their measurements of freezing rates of NAD from small (0.25\u00b5m) binary22\nHNO3 droplets, in the low temperature aerosol chamber AIDA, agree well23\nwith the results of a number other freezing studies in the literature when us-24\ning volume-based nucleation rates. The surface-based nucleation rates Stetzer25\net al. (2006) obtained from their data were also 1\u20133 orders of magnitude lower26\nthan those calculated by Tabazadeh et al. (2002a). They concluded that, for27\n30\nbinary HNO3 droplets, volume-based, rather than surface-based, homogeneous1\nnucleation is more likely under stratospheric conditions. Their companion pa-2\nper (Mo\u00a8hler et al., 2006) estimates very small homogeneous (volume-based)3\nnucleation rates for NAT in the stratosphere.4\nWhen considering liquid particle microphysics, we need to take into account5\nthe surface enrichment of HNO3 in both binary HNO3\/H2O and ternary6\nHNO3\/H2SO4\/H2O solutions (Yang and Finlayson-Pitts, 2001; Donaldson and7\nAnderson, 1999), which could influence surface-based nucleation rates. In addi-8\ntion, the presence of H2SO4 in STS droplets can strongly inhibit the nucleation9\nof HNO3-hydrates (Koop et al., 1997b). The Koop et al. (1997b) experiments,10\nhowever, used bulk samples, which are not suitable for studying surface-based11\nnucleation. Tabazadeh et al. (2002a) have suggested that, if H2SO4 is not a12\n\u201csurface active\u201d component, then it will have little effect on the surface tension13\nof the solution, and so on the free energy barrier to nucleation. However more14\nmeasurements of the nucleation of NAT\/NAD in ternary solution droplets, at15\nstratospherically relevant temperatures, are needed in order to answer these16\nquestions. In conclusion it appears that, from current knowledge, homogeneous17\nnucleation of NAT\/NAD from STS is not significant in the stratosphere, al-18\nthough there is not universal consensus on this subject.19\nAs mentioned above, bulk freezing experiments (Koop et al., 1997b) have20\nshown that heterogeneous nucleation of NAT from nitric-acid solutions on to21\nice is too slow a process to be significant in the stratosphere. In addition, lab-22\noratory measurements (Zondlo et al., 2000) indicate that binary HNO3\/H2O23\nsolutions on an ice surface do not nucleate to NAT readily, but form a meta-24\nstable liquid HNO3\/H2O film instead.25\n31\nLaboratory experiments using finely divided aqueous systems (Bogdan et al.,1\n2003) have shown that binary HNO3\/H2O solutions with \u223c 53wt% HNO32\nwill heterogeneously freeze to nitric acid hydrate on fumed silica at around3\n195K. These results suggest that heterogeneous nucleation of NAT\/NAD on4\nmeteoritic smoke nuclei could occur on STS particles passing through gravity5\nwaves, in a similar manner to the non-equilibrium homogeneous freezing de-6\nscribed above. Similar experiments with binary H2SO4\/H2O solutions found7\nthat freezing did not occur until around 175\u2013180K, too low a temperature for8\nthe stratosphere. This suggests that, again in a similar manner to homogeneous9\nfreezing of STS (Koop et al., 1997b), the heterogeneous freezing of liquid PSCs10\nwill only occur when H2SO4 is a minor constituent of the droplets (\u22640.1wt%),11\nalthough only freezing experiments with ternary HNO3\/H2SO4\/H2O solutions12\nwill prove this theory.13\n4 The effects of PSCs14\nSoon after the discovery of the ozone hole PSCs were found to be important15\nboth for aiding the release of active chlorine species as well extending the16\nlifetimes of these species by removing HNO3 (Toon et al., 1986; Solomon et al.,17\n1986; Solomon, 1990, 1999).18\nBelow we review how the microphysical properties of the PSCs determine the19\nmagnitude and extent of these effects, and how the microphysical properties20\nare, in turn, dependent on the climate of the polar vortex. The Antarctic21\nvortex is generally more stable, with greater symmetry around the pole, than22\nthe Arctic vortex. This is due to the more disruptive atmospheric wave activity23\nin the Northern hemisphere, which is caused by the configuration of land and24\n32\nsea in that hemisphere (see, e.g., Solomon, 2004, for a succinct description). As1\na result, the temperature distribution, and so volume of the air in which PSCs2\ncan exist, of the Arctic vortex depends greatly on the dynamical situation3\nof each winter (Pawson and Naujokat, 1999). As a consequence chlorine is4\nfrequently fully activated within the Antarctic vortex and so ozone loss is large5\n(e.g. WMO, 2006). Ozone loss within the Arctic vortex can vary considerably6\nfrom year to year, and is very dependent on changes in climate conditions7\n(Rex et al., 2004). The interactions between stratospheric ozone and climate8\nare outside the scope of this review \u2014 the interested reader is directed to9\nWMO (2006); Eyring et al. (2005) and references therein \u2014 but we note in10\npassing that global warming at the surface is associated with cooling in the11\nstratosphere. This is because greenhouse gases trap terrestrial infrared near the12\nEarth\u2019s surface and reduce the flux entering the stratosphere. There is evidence13\nthat the volume of Arctic stratosphere susceptible to ozone destruction may14\nbe changing, particularly in those years that are generally cold (Rex et al.,15\n2004).16\nLidar observations of PSCs from Ny-A\u02dalesund and McMurdo are illustrative,17\nthough not representative, of the differences in current PSC climatology be-18\ntween the two hemispheres (Maturilli et al., 2005). The number of days with19\nPSC observations was found to be 5 times higher at McMurdo (78\u00b0S, 167\u00b0E)20\nthan at Ny-A\u02dalesund (79\u00b0N, 12\u00b0E). PSCs above McMurdo generally contained21\nNAT, with very few observations of liquid or ice particles. In contrast, liq-22\nuid PSCs were more common than NAT PSCs above Ny-A\u02dalesund, however23\nalmost two-thirds of the days on which PSCs were observed both liquid and24\nNAT PSCs were present.25\nBelow we will examine the current knowledge of how the microphysics of PSC26\n33\nparticles affect heterogeneous reactions, and their role in removing HNO3. We1\ndo not undertake a discussion of stratospheric chemistry in general; this can2\nbe found in, e.g. Brasseur and Solomon (2005); Seinfeld and Pandis (2006);3\nMacKenzie (2003). Detailed discussions of outstanding problems in strato-4\nspheric chemistry are given in the special issue of Chemical Reviews on long-5\nterm issues in atmospheric chemistry (Ravishankara , 2003).6\n4.1 Heterogeneous Reactions on PSC particles7\nInvestigation into the properties of PSCs has been driven by their role in the8\ndestruction of the ozone layer. It was Farman et al. (1985) who first high-9\nlighted the thinning of the Southern polar ozone layer during the austral10\nspring. Solomon et al. (1986) demonstrated that ozone depletion was confined11\nto the lower polar stratosphere (10\u201320 km), which McCormick et al. (1981)12\nhad shown to contain PSCs during the austral winter. Solomon et al. (1986)13\nproposed two new heterogeneous reactions which, taking place on the surfaces14\nof PSC particles, would release active halogen species, principally Cl2, from15\ninert reservoir species:16\nXONO2(g) + HY(s, l)\u2192 XY(g) + HONO2(s, l), (5)\nXONO2(g) + H2O(s, l)\u2192 HOX(g) + HONO2(s, l). (6)\nwhere X and Y can be either Cl or Br. The photolytically active gaseous17\nmolecules, XY and HOX, resulting from reactions 5 and 6, as well as the18\nreaction19\nHOX(g) + HY(s)\u2192 XY(g) + H2O(s), (7)20\n34\nwould release atomic chlorine or bromine with the onset of spring, initiating1\nthe catalytic destruction of ozone (Solomon, 1999).2\nThe rates of reactions 5\u20137 due to the interaction of gas and aerosol can be3\nrepresented by the molecular flux J4\nJ = \u03b3ng c\u00af\/4, (8)5\nwhere \u03b3 is the uptake coefficient, ng is the density of the gas species and c\u00af6\nis the mean gas molecular speed. J depends on a number of processes: gas-7\nphase diffusion, mass accommodation, Henry\u2019s law solubility (in the case of8\nliquids), chemical reactions in the condensed bulk phase, and particle surface9\nproperties. These processes are coupled to each other, making their individual10\ndetermination from laboratory data difficult. Instead, in reactive uptake cases,11\n\u03b3 can be approximated by12\n1\n\u03b3\n=\n1\n\u03b1\n+\n1\n\u03b3sol + \u03b3rxn\n, (9)\n13\nwhere \u03b1 is the mass accommodation coefficient for the relevant species, \u03b3sol14\nis the solubility uptake coefficient, and \u03b3rxn is the reactive uptake coefficient.15\nIn cases of low solubility, or long exposure time, the system reaches a steady16\nstate and \u03b3sol becomes negligible; \u03b3 comes to be governed by \u03b1 and \u03b3rxn.17\nUptake coefficients for many of the different permutations of reactions 5\u20137 on18\ntypical stratospheric aerosol types have been derived using laboratory data.19\nState of the art values for these are documented in the reviews published by20\nJPL and IUPAC (respectively available from http:\/\/jpldataeval.jpl.nasa.gov21\nand http:\/\/www.iupac-kinetic.ch.cam.ac.uk). Experimental results indicate that22\nuptake coefficients for most combinations of reactions 5\u20137 on water ice are23\n35\nless than 0.3 (Sander et al., 2006). Experimental results indicate similarly1\nsmall uptake coefficients for reactions on nitric acid ice, although parameter-2\nisations are only available for the reactions ClONO2 +H2O, ClONO2 +HX,3\nand HOCl + HCl. Studies of reactions 5\u20137 on sulphuric acid solutions have4\nshown a strong negative temperature dependence \u2014 caused by the dependence5\nof these reactions on the solubility of the halogen species and on the activity of6\nH2O, which have inverse relationships with temperature. The most recent, and7\ncomprehensive, parameterisation of reactions 5\u20137 for chlorine species is given8\nin Shi et al. (2001). Looking at their parameterisation we see that the uptake9\ncoefficients for all the reactions increase as the temperature decreases (and10\nthe H2SO4 mass fraction drops), until just under 50% H2SO4, when reaction 511\nwins out in the competition with the other two reactions and approaches unity,12\nwhile the other reactions don\u2019t get above 0.1 (Figure 15). Reactions 5 and 613\nhave been parameterised for chlorine over SAT (Zhang et al., 1994a), how-14\never no more parameterisations are available for reactions occurring on SAT,15\nlikewise for reactions occurring on STS. Instead, for STS droplets, current16\nmicrophysical models use the reaction rates for binary sulphuric acid droplets17\n(e.g. Drdla and Schoeberl, 2003).18\nThe activation rates of halogens on aerosol particles are influenced by both19\nthe uptake coefficient on the particle and the particulate surface area avail-20\nable. Although we do not have measured values for all these reactions on all21\npossible stratospheric aerosol types, we can see that, for the temperatures at22\nwhich PSCs exist, the uptake coefficients are much greater for the background23\nstratospheric liquid sulphate aerosols than for the solid PSC particles. The24\navailable surface area of the liquid sulphate aerosol is generally much higher25\nthan that of the solid PSCs \u2013 the mean background stratospheric aerosol sur-26\n36\nface area density is 1\u00b5m2cm\u22123 (e.g. Thomason et al., 1997) \u2013 but very much1\nless than the surface area density of liquid PSCs. Within the stable Antarctic2\nvortex, NAT PSCs with relatively large surface area densities are widespread;3\nin the Arctic vortex, however, such dense NAT PSCs tend to be limited to the4\nrelatively small cold regions induced by mountain waves (e.g. Carslaw et al.,5\n1998b; Toon et al., 2000). Water ice PSCs are even less common, due to their6\nlow formation temperatures, however when they do form they can provide7\naerosol surface areas 100 times greater than those of liquid or NAT PSCs (e.g.8\nCarslaw et al., 1998b).9\nSince the onset of chlorine activation occurs at \u223c 195 K (Toohey et al., 1993;10\nWebster et al., 1993), it was initially assumed that activation was due to type11\nI (i.e. NAT) PSCs. As knowledge of PSC microphysics has improved it has be-12\ncome clear that chlorine activation is due more to the presence of liquid rather13\nthan NAT particles. However, as a first order approximation, many large-scale14\nsimulations of stratospheric ozone loss still use TNAT or 195K as the thresh-15\nold temperature for switching on heterogeneous chlorine activation (e.g. Ku\u00a8hl16\net al., 2004; Geer et al., 2006). Drdla (2007) suggests that the coincidence of17\nchlorine activation with TNAT occurs because at standard stratospheric con-18\nditions this also happens to be close to the temperature at which chlorine19\nactivation becomes significant on the background liquid sulphate aerosols.20\nHowever this relationship can break down in air masses which have under21\ngone perturbations such as denitrification. Drdla (2007) have developed a pa-22\nrameterisation (called TACL) \u2014 based on H2O mixing ratio, sulphate surface23\narea at 210K, and pressure \u2014 which can be used as a diagnostic of where chlo-24\nrine activation is most likely. Finding a sufficiently accurate and computation-25\nally efficient parameterisation of PSCs and chlorine activation for global-scale26\n37\nmodels is one of the most important remaining problems in PSC studies.1\nAs noted above, current microphysical models which deal with chlorine ac-2\ntivation on STS droplets must use reaction rates devised for sulphuric acid3\nsolutions. Measurements of reactions 5\u20137 on ternary have been made, but4\nno clear parameterisation has been produced. Zhang et al. (1994b) measured5\nreactions 6 and 7, and concluded that the rates of these reactions were un-6\naffected by the presence of HNO3. However none of their solutions contained7\nmore than 5% HNO3. Elrod et al. (1995) measured reaction 6 over ternary so-8\nlutions with HNO3\/H2SO4 mass fractions between 0.283\/0.202 \u2013 0.022\/0.503.9\nThe reaction probabilities they measured for these solutions were between10\n5\u201332% lower than those they measured for sulphuric acid solutions at repre-11\nsentative compositions for the relevant stratospheric temperatures. However12\nthere was no obvious dependence on composition in these reductions. Zhang13\net al. (1995) measured Reaction 5 on ternary solution over the temperature14\nrange 196\u2013214K. The HNO3\/H2SO4 mass fractions at 196K were 0.112\/0.36415\n(as calculated by Hanson, 1998). They concluded that the probabilities of16\nReaction 5 were the same for ternary solutions as they were for sulphuric17\nacid solutions; however Hanson (1998) noted that, where appreciable amounts18\nof HNO3 are present, their data are consistent (within uncertainties) with a19\nsignificant reduction in the reaction probabilities. Hanson (1998) measured20\nReactions 5 and 6 on ternary solutions with HNO3\/H2SO4 mass fractions of21\n0.044\/0.446 to 0.256\/0.203. They found that the measured reaction proba-22\nbilities were significantly lower than those predicted for the corresponding23\nsulphuric acid solutions. Fits to the data were obtained by reducing the bulk24\nreaction probability by a factor of 2, and the surface reaction probabilities by a25\nfactor of 0\u201310 (increasing with increasing HNO3 mass fraction). However they26\n38\nproduced no comprehensive parameterisation of the reaction probabilities on1\nternary solutions.2\nTo date there have been no more experimental investigations of the rates of3\nreactions 5\u20137 on ternary solutions. The lack of data on these reactions is ham-4\npering our understanding of chlorine activation in the Arctic vortex, where5\nSTS PSCs are very common (e.g. Maturilli et al., 2005). The increases in6\nparticle surface area of STS aerosols over sulphuric acid aerosols, due to the7\nuptake in nitric acid and water, will lead to a greater activation of chlorine.8\nHowever this increase may not be as large as that currently seen in microphys-9\nical models if the presence of HNO3 reduces the reaction rates by the degree10\nseen in the studies of Elrod et al. (1995) and Hanson (1998)(Lowe et al., 2006).11\n4.2 Denitrification12\nIn addition to providing reactive surfaces for the release of active chlorine13\ncompounds, PSCs can contribute to the destruction of ozone via the denitri-14\nfication of the stratosphere. The condensation of HNO3 on to PSC particles15\nstops the deactivation of gas-phase ClOxby reaction with NO2 from photolysed16\nHNO3 (Toon et al., 1986). If PSC particles subsequently sediment out of the17\nstratosphere, then the HNO3 they contain is permanently removed, extending18\nthe lifetime of the active chlorine compounds. Denitrification occurs in both19\npolar stratospheres (e.g. Fahey et al., 1990), however it is most intense over20\nAntarctica; where large fractions of the total HNO3 are irreversibly removed.21\nThe differences in the amounts of denitrification, and ozone loss, between the22\ntwo hemispheres are due to the greater stability of the Antarctic vortex. Al-23\n39\nthough both vortices form at similar times in the autumn\/early-winter, on1\naverage the Antarctic vortex breaks down a month later in the season than2\nthe Arctic vortex. In addition, while the Antarctic vortex is generally very3\nstable except during the spring breakup; the area, position, and strength of4\nthe Arctic vortex are highly variable, especially during the late winter (Waugh5\nand Randel, 1999). The stability of the Antarctic vortex produces much colder6\nconditions than are experienced in the Arctic stratosphere, allowing increased7\nPSC formation which leads to greater denitrification. In addition, extend-8\ning the cold stratospheric temperatures into the austral spring allows the re-9\nactivation, on PSCs, of any ClONO2 formed during the spring. Portmann et al.10\n(1996) argue that this process is as important as denitrification for ozone loss11\nin the Antarctic.12\nDenitrification involves the sedimentation of large HNO3-containing particles;13\nhowever, until recently, it has not been clear exactly what these particles are,14\nor how they form. STS particles are too small (typically radii of \u223c0.5\u00b5m) to15\nhave sedimentation speeds greater than a metre per day. Similarly, if all back-16\nground aerosol particles act as nucleation sites for NAT, then NAT particles17\nwould also be too small to promote denitrification. The most likely particles to18\ncause denitrification are ice particles. Because of the relatively high amounts of19\nH2O in the atmosphere, ice particles can grow to the large sizes necessary for20\nefficient sedimentation, and can incorporate gaseous HNO3 in the form of NAT21\n(e.g. Wofsy et al., 1990). The sedimentation of these ice particles would also22\nresult in dehydration of the stratosphere, which inhibits ozone loss, though to23\na lesser degree than it is promoted by denitrification.24\nObservations of denitrification have, however, painted a more complicated25\npicture. Analysis of in-situ and remote observations from the Arctic winter of26\n40\n1994\u201395 suggested that the denitrification observed was predominantly caused1\nby small number densities of large NAT particles (Waibel et al., 1999). The2\nthen-current modelling practice of assuming that all aerosol particles froze to3\nNAT, creating a population of many small NAT particles, led to an under-4\nestimation of the true influence of NAT particles on the stratosphere. In addi-5\ntion, satellite-based observations indicated that, during relatively warm winter6\nmonths in the Antarctic, extensive denitrification can occur without any sig-7\nnificant dehydration (Tabazadeh et al., 2000). However, up to this point, no8\nlarge NAT particles had been measured in-situ.9\nThis changed in the Arctic winter of 1999\u20132000, during which the most exten-10\nsive denitrification observed above the Arctic occurred (Popp et al., 2001). In-11\nsitu measurements (see Section 2 and Northway et al., 2002) detected HNO3-12\ncontaining particles, with diameters as large as 10\u201320\u00b5m and total number13\ndensities in the order of 10\u22124 cm\u22123 (Fahey et al., 2001). Highly selective nucle-14\nation mechanisms, such as low freezing rates of NAT (or NAD) below \u223c196K15\n(e.g. Tabazadeh et al., 2001), or NAT formation via ice particles (e.g. Waibel16\net al., 1999), were put forward to interpret the observations. Because of the17\nlength of time needed for these particles to grow, Mann et al. (2003) showed18\nthat, regardless of nucleation mechanism, the amount of denitrification likely19\nto occur could be determined using the \u201cclosed-flow area\u201d of the vortex. This20\nis based on the degree of concentricity of the vortex and the mass of air with21\ntemperatures below TNAT (see Figure 16).22\nModel studies (Carslaw et al., 2002) have shown that synoptic-scale ice clouds23\nwere very unlikely to be the source of the observed \u201dNAT-rocks\u201d, and sug-24\ngested that, although localised gravity waves are known sources of NAT parti-25\ncles (Carslaw et al., 1998a), they would produce only a limited number of the26\n41\nobserved large particles. Fueglistaler et al. (2002) proposed that the gravita-1\ntional settling of particles from typical Type Ia PSCs, into air supersaturated2\nwith respect to NAT, could act as a source for NAT-rocks. However observa-3\ntions of NAT PSCs in situations where this cannot have occurred suggest that4\nthis mechanism is not the only source of NAT-rock particles in the stratosphere5\n(Voigt et al., 2005). A number of studies of NAT formation during the win-6\nter of 2002\/2003 have suggested that observed NAT particle numbers (Larsen7\net al., 2004; Voigt et al., 2005) and levels of denitrification (Groo\u00df et al., 2005;8\nDavies et al., 2006) can be reproduced using a simple flat nucleation rate of9\nNAT particles, at temperatures below TNAT. The nucleation rates determined10\nare 25 \u00d7 10\u22126 (Larsen et al., 2004), 8 \u00d7 10\u22126 (Voigt et al., 2005), 7.8 \u00d7 10\u2212611\n(Groo\u00df et al., 2005), and 12 \u00d7 10\u22126 particles cm\u22123hr\u22121(Davies et al., 2006).12\nModelling studies of denitrification during previous Arctic winters have de-13\ntermined optimal nucleation rates of a similar magnitude: 2.9 \u00d7 10\u22126 parti-14\ncles cm\u22123hr\u22121 for the winter 1999\/2000 (Mann et al., 2003), and 12 \u00d7 10\u2212615\nparticles cm\u22123hr\u22121 for the winter 1994\/95 (Davies et al., 2005).16\n5 Summary17\nTo summarise: (1) In-situ instrumentation has improved to the point where18\nwe can measure the amounts of the major constituents of the condensed phase19\nand their ratios \u2014 allowing for the positive identification of STS and NAT20\nparticles in the Arctic Stratosphere. (2) Satellite instruments can now be used21\nto identify the category of PSCs as well as their synoptic extent - improving22\nthe temporal and spatial coverage of observations. (3) The major types of PSC23\nparticles have been identified, and observed in the stratosphere. Simple ho-24\n42\nmogeneous nucleation of NAT from STS droplets has been shown to occur at1\ntoo low a rate to be significant in the stratosphere. Whether NAT nucleates2\nthrough a classical volume-dependent heterogeneous route, a surface-based3\npseudo-heterogeneous route, or some other route, is still not clear. (4) Our4\nknowledge of the heterogeneous reaction rates for the release of halogens on5\nPSC particles is extensive \u2014 but still inadequate for STS droplets, which6\nare the most common PSC type in the Arctic. This lack of knowledge lim-7\nits the accuracy of the large-scale microphysical models which have recently8\nbeen developed. (5) \u201cNAT-rocks\u201d have been discovered in the Arctic. These9\nlarge particles have been shown to be important in the denitrification of the10\nstratosphere. (6) Global warming at the surface is associated with cooling in11\nthe stratosphere. Stratospheric cooling will likely change the frequency of oc-12\ncurrence of PSCs, as well as changing stratospheric chemistry more generally.13\nThere is evidence that the volume of Arctic stratosphere susceptible to ozone14\ndestruction may be changing, particularly in those years that are generally15\ncold. (7) A sufficiently accurate, yet computationally efficient, parameterisa-16\ntion of PSC microphysics and chemistry, for use in global chemistry-climate17\nmodels, is yet to be developed. This limits the accuracy with which the recov-18\nery of the ozone layer, and the impact of stratospheric processes on climate,19\ncan be forecast.20\n43\nReferences1\nBaumgardner, D., Dye, J.
