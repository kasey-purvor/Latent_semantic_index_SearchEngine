Alho, University of Helsinki, Finland\nLavie (1995) have suggested that perceptual processing is infl uenced by perceptual load. Specifi cally, relevant information receives \nadditional processing in high load situations exhausting the available capacity. On the other hand, irrelevant information receives \nless processing with increasing load on a relevant task, as there is a reduced amount of residual processing available. Rees et al. \n(1997) provided the fi rst physiological evidence for this model, showing this pattern in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. \nLikewise, Handy et al. (2001) offered supporting evidence measuring event related potentials (ERPs). Both of these studies presented \nirrelevant information in peripheral vision. Here we manipulated load while using the identical stimuli and the same task (a peripheral \ngap judgment task) with centrally presented irrelevant stimuli. ERPs show the pattern predicted by Lavie and colleagues, specifi cally \nfor the N1 component. This work offers further evidence that visual attention modulates relatively early processing of perceptual \ninformation. Specifi cally, increasing load resulted in stronger N1 responses to relevant information and weaker N1 responses to irrelevant \ninformation.\nKeywords: human, perception, spatial attention, perceptual load\nINTRODUCTION\nIn order to respond effectively to our environment, the visual system \nmust selectively process relevant items while concurrently suppressing \nirrelevant signals. The processing devoted to irrelevant stimuli is one of \nthe enduring topics in psychology. Proponents of early selection suggest \nthat unattended stimuli are attenuated at the initial stages of process-\ning. According to this view, unattended stimuli receive little higher-order \nprocessing (Broadbent, 1958). On the other hand, supporters of late selec-\ntion models believe both attended and unattended information receive \nsubstantial processing, with a processing bottleneck only occurring at a \nlate stage (e.g., response selection) (Deutsch and Deutsch, 1963), with \nirrelevant material being substantially processed. Surprisingly, different \nbehavioral studies appear to support for each of these apparently contra-\ndictory models of perception. Lavie and colleagues (Lavie, 1995; Lavie and \nRobertson, 2001; Lavie and Tsal, 1994) have provided an elegant model \nto account for this paradox. They argue that the split between \u2018early\u2019 and \n\u2018late\u2019 selection is a false dichotomy, driven by different task demands. \nAccording to their model, the visual system has a limited capacity to \nprocess information. When the visual scene is relatively impoverished \n(imposing a relatively low perceptual load), both attended and unattended \ninformation will be processed (i.e., late selection). On the other hand, \nwhen confronted with very complex, rapidly changing scenes the visual \nsystem is overwhelmed, and only attended information can be processed \n(i.e., early selection). This model powerfully explains evidence from the \nsupporters of both early and late selection. Importantly, according to this \nmodel the extent to which irrelevant stimuli are processed does not only \ndepend on the participants\u2019 intention, but is dependent on the processing \ndemands of the relevant stimuli. In low load situations, irrelevant informa-\ntion will be processed to a high level, regardless of the participants\u2019 inten-\ntion. To summarize, the perceptual load model suggests that the visual \nsystem has a limited capacity, and that the role of selective attention is to \nprioritize the deployment of attention in high load situations.\nIn addition to the behavioral predictions, the perceptual load model \nalso makes clear physiological predictions (Handy, 2000). Specifi cally, \nthis model makes two predictions. First, brain activation in response to \nattended information should be positively correlated with perceptual load: \nincreasing task demands will result in increased processing. Second, \nbrain activation in response to unattended stimuli should be negatively \ncorrelated with perceptual loads: during diffi cult tasks there will be lit-\ntle residual processing capacity and therefore unattended stimuli should \nnot drive a powerful neural response. It should be noted that the fi rst \nprediction is compatible with many models of perceptual processing: the \nidea that increasing task demands will lead to increasing neural acti-\nvation is not unique to the perceptual load model.

Examining the infl uence of percep-\ntual load on neural response offers a way to both test the perceptual \nload model of attention as well as offering a tool to determine both the \nbrain regions involved with attentional modulation and the time course \nof top-down control. For example, neuroimaging techniques such as \nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can reveal whether early \ncortical regions such as V1 (striate cortex) respond differently to attended \ncompared to unattended information, allowing us to infer whether these \nvisual centers always process information in the same way, or whether \ntop-down control modulates the neural response. On the other hand, \nelectrophysiological techniques such as event related potentials (ERPs) \ncan determine whether attended and unattended information lead to dif-\nferent neural responses within the fi rst 200 ms of processing, or whether \nonly later responses are modulated by attention. Crucially, the perceptual \nload model makes clearly testable physiological predictions, allowing the \nmodel to be validated and potentially offering insight into the anatomy \nand timing of the stages of perceptual processing.\nThe fi rst study to directly test the physiological predictions of the per-\nceptual load model was conducted by Rees et al. (1997). In this fMRI \nstudy the participants were asked to do either a simple (low percep-\ntual load task) or diffi cult task (high perceptual load task). Specifi cally, \nwords were presented at the center of the screen and during the low-load \nblocks subjects were instructed to press a button when the words were \nprinted in uppercase letters, and in the high load task to press the button \nwhen the words were bisyllabic. During some blocks, the background \nwas a static image, while in other blocks the peripheral regions of the dis-\nplay presented a moving \u2018starfi eld\u2019 pattern, which the participants were \nasked to ignore throughout the experiment. When subjects performed the \ndiffi cult central task, activity in the motion sensitive regions of the brain \nwere reduced compared to when the subjects did the simple central task. \nThis fi nding accords with the perceptual load model: during the high load \ntask, more attention was required by the central task, so there was less \nresidual capacity left for motion processing.\nThis infl uential study demonstrates that the perceptual load model \nmakes testable physiological predictions. However, some have noted a \npair of limitations in this seminal work (Handy et al., 2001). First, very dif-\nferent tasks were used for the two levels of perceptual load. The diffi cult \nlanguage task may require drive very different neural processing than the \nletter case identifi cation task, regardless of perceptual load. Second, the \nblock-design MRI design offers fairly poor temporal resolution. Therefore, \nit is unclear whether these fi ndings show differences in initial perceptual \nprocessing or later infl uences of top-down feedback.\nYi et al. (2004) also examined perceptual load in a functional MRI \nstudy. In their study participants viewed pictures of central (relevant) \nfaces surrounded by (irrelevant) scenes of places. The participants were \ntested in situations of low perceptual diffi culty, high perceptual diffi culty \nand a perceptually easy task that required high working memory load. \nThe experimenters measured the response of the parahippocampal cor-\ntex (PPA), which typically shows a strong response to pictures of places. \nThey found that novel irrelevant stimuli generated more robust responses \nthan repeated stimuli under low perceptual load or high working load. \nHowever, the PPA did not show a novelty effect in the high perceptual load \nsituation, as predicted by Lavie\u2019s model. As the same task was used for \nthe low and high perceptual load task, it addresses one of the potential \ncriticisms of the study by Rees et al. (1997).\nLikewise, Pinsk et al. (2004) used fMRI to investigate perceptual load. \nThey presented target stimuli to the attended hemifi eld, with distractors \nsimultaneously presented to the unattended hemifi eld. The target stimuli \nwere either unambiguous (a single complex picture) or ambiguous (alpha \nblending two complex images, one with 70% weighting and the other with \n30% weighting), while the distractor stimuli were composed by blending \ntwo pictures (each with 50% weight). In the low-load blocks participants \nwere asked to count the number of nonambiguous targets, while in the \nhigh load blocks the task was to count the number of times the same \ntarget stimulus was presented twice in a row. Thus, the stimuli were \nidentical across tasks, though the task differed. The authors found that \nactivity to the target stimuli increased with increasing attentional load. \nOn the other hand, increasing attentional load correlated with decreasing \nresponses to the distractor items in areas V4 and the inferior temporal \ncortical area referred to as TEO, but not the early visual centers of V1 \nand V2. Therefore, this work suggests that the earliest cortical visual \ncenters are not modulated by load.\nA study by Handy et al. (2001) attempted to use ERPs to investigate \nthis topic. ERPs provide excellent temporal resolution that is particularly \nwell suited for identifying and discriminating the brain\u2019s initial cortical \nresponses to external stimuli. While techniques such as fMRI can iden-\ntify brain activation in low level sensory cortices, the sluggish nature of \nblood fl ow measured by fMRI make it diffi cult to determine the temporal \nsequence of these activations, therefore it can be diffi cult to dissociate \nfeedforward versus feedback modulation (particularly once data has been \ntemporally smoothed). Furthermore, in their second experiment both high \nand low load conditions used the same task: a simple letter discrimination \ntask (participants had to judge whether a foveally presented stimulus was \nan A or H). During low load trials, the target letters were presented in isola-\ntion, while in the high load task the target letters were masked and pre-\nsented for a shorter interval. The (foveal) target letters were presented in \n75% of trials, while irrelevant parafoveal distractor items were presented \nin the remaining trials. P1 is a positive electrophysiological component that \noccurs around 120 ms after the onset of a visual target. Combined ERP \nand imaging studies have linked the P1 to initial sensory input or bottom-\nup processing in fusiform gyrus (Herrmann and Knight, 2001). Previous \nstudies suggest that the amplitude of P1 is modulated by spatial selec-\ntion (e.g., larger amplitude signals are observed if an object appears at an \nexpected location versus an unexpected location). Handy and colleagues \nfound that the P1 component measured at electrode positions POZ and OZ \n(posterior locations) were statistically larger for distractors that occurred \nduring low load situations than those that occurred under high load, com-\npatible with predictions of the perceptual load model of attention.\nHowever, the crucial prediction of the perceptual load model specifi -\ncally predicts an interaction effect: with increasing load correlating with \nstronger responses to target stimuli, but weaker responses to distrac-\ntor stimuli. Unfortunately, Handy et al. (2001) do not report the effect \nof perceptual load on the foveal target stimuli. This is probably due to \nthe fact that the target stimuli were physically different in the low and \nhigh perceptual load studies. Therefore, with their design, different P1 \nresponses to the high and low load target stimuli might refl ect different \nattentional load or merely different physical properties. However, in the \ndiscussion the authors suggest that there is evidence for an interaction of \nthe P1, based on their present work combined with some of their previous \nfi ndings (Handy and Mangun, 2000). However, inspection of their earlier \nwork (Handy and Mangun, 2000) reveals that stronger P1 components \nare not always seen with increasing perceptual load: rather they found \nthat perceptual load results in stronger P1 responses only when a target \nappears at an expected location. In this same work the authors, sup-\nporting previous fi ndings by Hillyard et al. (1998), suggest that attention-\nrelated modulations in the N1 may arise under any conditions of high \nperceptual load. In other words, N1 attentional effect refl ects a limited-\ncapacity discriminative process. The N1 is a posterior negative defl ection \nobserved around 160 ms after the onset stimulus onset, which is believe \nto be generated in the lateral extrastriate cortex (Herrmann and Knight, \n2001). While the P1 is often described as being associated with spatial \nselection in general, the N1 appears to be related with object-selective \nattention (Martinez et al., 2007).\nOur present study was designed to extend the work by Handy et al. \n(2001) and Rees et al. (1997). Specifi cally, we aimed at making two major \nimprovements. First, we wanted to use an identical task with physically \nidentical stimuli across high and low loads. As noted, a criticism of \nRees et al. (1997) is that their two perceptual loads used very differ-\nent tasks, which may make different cognitive demands. On the other \nPerceptual load modulates ERPs\nwww.frontiersin.org\n3\nhand, Handy et al. (2001) used physically different target stimuli, making \nit  diffi cult to compare neural responses to these items. Our second goal \nwas to present the irrelevant items at the center of the display, with target \ninformation more peripheral in order to avoid a possible confound in the \nwork of Handy and colleagues. Both Rees et al. (1997) and Handy et al. \n(2001) use foveal targets with irrelevant stimuli presented in the periph-\nery. Many models of attention other than Lavie\u2019s perceptual load model \nmight predict their results in terms of foveal versus peripheral location. \nThus, for example, during high load it is logically possible that we become \nless responsive to peripheral\/parafoveal stimuli. Alternatively, in the pre-\nvious studies the participants may have had a stronger incentive to main-\ntain fi xation during the hard task than the easy task (e.g., the low load \ntask might not require foveal perception). Since our design positioned \nthe irrelevant items centrally\/foveally, while the target information was \npresented more peripherally\/parafoveally, we can distinguish between \nthese competing explanations. While it has been demonstrated that both \ncentral and peripheral distractors are modulated by perceptual load (Beck \nand Lavie, 2005), it is still possible that the previous physiological meas-\nures may refl ect different fi xation strategies.\nTo achieve these goals, we used a gap judgment task, as illustrated \nin Figure 1, inspired by behavioral task used by Mattingley et al. (2006). \nAt the start of each block, the participant was instructed to either com-\npare the top-left gaps with bottom-right gaps or to compare the top-right \ngaps with the bottom-left gaps. This was done by presenting a diagonal \narrow, informing the participant which sides of the upcoming diamonds \nwere to be monitored. This arrow was green prior to blocks of low load \ntrials and red prior to blocks of diffi cult trials, allowing the participants to \nanticipate the diffi culty of the block. During the subsequent target trials, \nthe participant was presented with a diamond that had a notch cut into \neach side. The task was to decide whether the designated top or bottom \ngap was larger (responding by pressing either an upper or lower button). \nOn a minority of trials, a large, salient distractor was presented at fi xa-\ntion, which the participant was asked to ignore. Crucially, throughout low \nload blocks, all of the gap judgments were relatively easy, while on other \nblocks (high load) the required gap judgments were diffi cult. As each \ndiamond had two pairs of gaps (both an easy judgment pair and a dif-\nfi cult judgment pair), the visual stimuli were identical: the only difference \nwas the instructions given at the start of the block regarding the pair of \ngaps that the participant needed to compare. The irrelevant gaps did not \npredict the correct answer for the relevant gaps, so the hard trials had \nto be solved by attending to the gaps of similar size. Note that previous \nstudies have presented distractor stimuli in the periphery, with the task \nat the center of fi xation. In contrast, with our task the distractor stimuli \nwas centrally positioned with the target information in the periphery. Our \naim was not to spatially infl uence attentional processing \u2013 previous ERP \nstudies have indicated that participants can selectively attend to bilat-\neral peripheral locations while relatively attenuating responses to central \nstimuli (M\u00fcller et al., 2003). Rather, our design eliminates the potential \nconfound that participants may be less likely to maintain strict fi xation \nduring relatively easy tasks than diffi cult tasks.\nDuring the ERP recording we asked participants to completely ignore \nthe irrelevant stimuli. This ensures that during the ERP recording these \nstimuli were truly irrelevant to the participants. If perceptual load modulates \nattentional selection, we expected an interaction between stimulus type \n(task relevant targets and irrelevant stimuli) and perceptual load (low during \nblocks of easy gap judgments and high during blocks of diffi cult discrimi-\nnations). Specifi cally, we were looking for waveforms that showed stronger \nresponses to targets with increasing perceptual load while showing weaker \nresponses to irrelevant stimuli with increasing perceptual load.\nAs we did not collect behavioral responses to the central (irrelevant) \nstimuli during ERP recording, we collected pilot behavioral data from a sep-\narate group of 10 participants to ensure that our specifi c paradigm elicits \nthe behavioral pattern reported by Lavie and colleagues. This pilot study \nwas identical to the main experiment, except that we asked participants to \npress either button whenever they saw the central purple item (and did not \nask participants to wear the ERP electrodes). Analysis of this data replicated \nthe classic perceptual load fi ndings: e.g., the low load versus high load \ncontrast revealed faster responses to both peripheral gaps (596 ms versus \n837 ms) and purple central items (589 ms versus 635 ms).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThirty-three healthy individuals participated in this study. All participants \nhad normal (or corrected to normal) vision. All subjects were undergradu-\nate students at the University of South Carolina and gave informed consent \nto take part in the experiment.\nParticipants were seated 117 cm from a 29-inch cathode ray tube \ncomputer monitor (NEC Multisync XM29, 685 cm diagonal visible image) \nwith stimuli presented at 640 horizontal and 480 vertical pixels. All stimuli \nwere presented on a black background, for high defi nition in a darkened \nroom. Throughout the experiment a small white cross (0.9\u00b0 high and wide) \nwas presented at the center of the screen, and the participants were asked \nto maintain fi xation throughout the session. At the beginning of each block \nof stimuli, a large diagonal arrow appeared on the screen for 5000 ms as \nan indication of which sides of the stimuli subjects should be attending \nto (either top-left and bottom-right positions or top-right and bottom-left \npositions). The participants were informed that the color of this arrow indi-\ncated how hard the upcoming series of trials was going to be: a red arrow \npreceded blocks of diffi cult judgments (high perceptual load task) and a \ngreen arrow preceded blocks of easy gap judgments (low perceptual load \ntask). After a short 2000 ms wait, a central fi xation cross was presented \non the screen for 1000 ms followed by the fi rst target stimuli.\nThe target stimuli comprised thin blue (24-bit color 0x0000FF) lines, \nmaking up a diamond shape (8.2\u00b0 wide and 8.2\u00b0 high, see Figure 1), with \nsmall gaps of varying size in each of the four sides. Participants were \nasked to judge which of the two gaps on opposite sides of the diamond \nshape was the larger and to respond as quickly and as accurately as \npossible. The gap sizes varied so that no same identical gap sizes were \ndisplayed in the same trial (i.e., a correct response was always possible). \nFigure 1. A schematic illustration of the sequence of events. Each block \nof trials began with a diagonal arrow that indicated the locations the par-\nticipant was expected to attend. The color of this arrow was either green \n(indicating a block of easy judgments) or red (indicating a series of diffi cult \njudgments, as shown here). Subsequently, the participant observed a series \nof blue diamonds. The participant was requested to make a decision regard-\ning whether the top or bottom gap was larger by pressing an upper or lower \nbutton. Note that each diamond included two pairs of gaps: an easy pair and \na diffi cult pair, so the visual stimuli were identical on the easy and diffi cult \nblocks, with only the initial diagonal arrow indicating whether the partici-\npant was comparing the easy or diffi cult pair. Occasionally, a bright fuchsia-\ncolored circle interrupted the stream of diamonds. The participant was asked \nto ignore these stimuli.\nR o r d e n  e t  a l .\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience  |  May 2008  |  Volume 2  |  Article 4\n4\nThe mouse was positioned sideways so that pressing the upper-most \nbutton indicated that the participant judged the top gap on the diamond \nto be larger than the bottom gap. Similarly, pressing the lower key on \nthe mouse indicated that the bottom gap was judged to be larger than \nthe top gap. Target items remained visible until the participant made a \nresponse or 10,000 ms had elapsed. Note that every display included \nboth an easy and a hard comparison, with the pair of gaps to be judged by \nthe observers cued by the block instructions. In this way we were able to \nensure that the stimuli in the two different load conditions were  identical. \nOn a few (20%) trials a large bright purple (2.4\u00b0 0xFF00FF) \u2018blob\u2019 (the \nirrelevant stimulus) appeared at the center of the screen instead of the \ntarget. Presence of a distractor was entirely unrelated to target condi-\ntions. Participants were asked to ignore these stimuli completely. These \nirrelevant stimuli were presented for 500 ms. The target and irrelevant \nstimuli were followed by a blank screen that lasted for 2000 ms, and then \na fi xation stimulus was displayed for 1000 ms prior to the next trial.\nTrials were presented in four blocks of 100 trials, with the irrelevant \nstimulus appearing in 20 of those trials. Two of the blocks consisted of \n\u2018easy\u2019 stimuli and the other two blocks consisted of \u2018hard\u2019 stimuli. These four \nblocks each appeared in a random order. Prior to the experimental blocks, \nparticipants completed a practice phase of four blocks of 40 trials each, \nagain with two \u2018easy\u2019 blocks and two \u2018hard\u2019 blocks appearing in a random \norder. The irrelevant stimulus did not appear in this practice phase.\nScalp potentials were recorded using a 128-channel geodesic net. \nPrior to beginning the behavioral task, impedances were checked and \nelectrodes adjusted so that they were all below 50 K\u03a9. Individual channels \nthat showed truncation or poor impedances during this calibration were \nremoved from further analysis. The net was connected to a high input \nimpedance amplifi er and EEG\u2019s were sampled at 250 Hz continuously \nthroughout the session. Data was processed using NetStation 3.0 (www.\negi.com), in the following stages. First, the recordings were smoothed \nusing a 55-Hz low pass fi lter, attenuating the effects of the 60 Hz electrical \nline noise. The continuous recording was then segmented into individual \ntrials, with each segment spanning 100 ms prior to the stimulus onset and \ncontinuing until 500 ms after stimulus onset (150 samples per segment). \nWe next visually inspected the initial segments from each participant to \nensure that data from the eye muscle channels appeared robust. This \nstage led us to reject four participants who showed poor recording from \nthese critical electrodes. Next, segments were subjected to an artifact \ndetection algorithm, rejecting trials and channels that were not accurate \nrefl ections of brain activity (most commonly due to eye blinks). This arti-\nfact rejection included the following criteria: channels rejected if amplitude \nexceeded 200 \u00b5V or if the amplitude changed by >200 \u00b5V within the seg-\nment or showed no variance at all during the segment. We rejected trials \nwhere eye blinks or eye movements occurred, using a detection threshold \nof 70 \u00b5V for the relevant channels. Channels were completely excluded \nfrom analysis if they consistently were rejected due to the above listed \ncriteria (i.e., we did not analyze channels that were identifi ed as bad in at \nleast 25% of the trials). We excluded individuals where eye movements \nor other artifacts accounted for more than one third of the trials in any \ncondition. This criterion led us to reject the data from 10 participants \n(all of these participants showed a high number of blinks in response to \nthe rare and bright irrelevant blobs). The next stage of processing was \ndata averaging, where individual segments from the same condition were \ncollapsed, resulting in one mean for each condition at each channel. The \nresulting data fi les were then individually inspected, with channels with \nbehavior that was clearly different than their neighbors excluded from fur-\nther analysis. We then conducted bad channel replacement, using neigh-\nboring good channels to interpolate data for the bad channels. Next, we \nconducted signal averaging (so the summed voltage from all channels \nwas 0 \u00b5V, eliminating artifacts caused by using a vertex reference: includ-\ning signal variability in the reference channel and artifactual increases in \nsignal difference with larger topographic distance from the vertex). The \nfi nal preprocessing step was baseline correction: the voltage of all time-\npoints at each channel was either increased or decreased by a constant \namount so that the mean amplitude for the fi rst 100 ms (i.e., the portion of \nthe segment that occurred prior to stimulus onset) was 0 V.\nFor each subject, the P1 was identifi ed as the most positive sample \nthat occurred in the time window of 110\u2013170 ms after stimulus onset, \nwhile the N1 was the most negative sample occurring between 180 and \n240 ms post stimulus onset. To replicate Handy and Mangun\u2019s analyses \nP1 values were estimated by computing the mean voltage at the neigh-\nboring electrode sites O1\/O2. N1 was measured separately for each \nhemisphere based on the measured voltages at P7\/PO7 (left) and P8\/PO8 \n(right). Visually evoked potentials P1 and N1 tend to be maximal at these \nsites (Mangun and Hillyard, 1991).\nRESULTS\nThe behavioral analysis examined each participant\u2019s median response time \nfor each condition. Behavioral data was recorded for 18 of the 19 partici-\npants included in the ERP analysis. Repeated-measures t-tests confi rmed \nthat subjects were signifi cantly slower at responding to the more diffi -\ncult visual judgments [t(17) = 6.4, p < 0.001; group mean response time \n990 ms versus 685 ms]. Arc-sin transformed accuracy data revealed sig-\nnifi cantly more errors in the diffi cult task [t(17) = 2.16, p < 0.045; mean \naccuracy 94.9% versus 97.9%]. This suggests that the effect found in \nresponse times does not refl ect a simple speed-error trade-off.\nThe signals measured by electrodes that are particularly sensitive \nto the P1 are shown in Figure 2. The P1 data were subjected to a two-\n factor 2 \u00d7 2 repeated measures ANOVA. The factors were perceptual load \nFigure 2. The P1 components from this study. Note that numerically the \nP1 is stronger during periods of low perceptual load (dotted line) than periods \nof high perceptual load (solid line). This effect is found both for targets as well \nas irrelevant distractor items. The top row of plots shows ERPs to the target \nstimuli where the participant was expected to make a gap judgment. The \nlower row shows ERPs to the irrelevant but salient central distractor stimuli. \nThe horizontal axis shows time, beginning 100 ms prior to stimulus onset and \ncontinuing until 500 ms after onset, while the vertical axis shows the voltage \n(with a range from +5 to \u22125 \u00b5V). The solid line represents the ERP during \nperiods of high perceptual load while the dotted line shows responses during \nsequences of low perceptual load.\nP1\nDistractor\nTarget\nCentral O1\/O2\nLow Load\nHigh Load\nP1\nPerceptual load modulates ERPs\nwww.frontiersin.org\n5\n(low\/high) and stimulus type (target\/irrelevant). For the P1 component, a \nmain effect of stimulus type was observed [F(1,18) = 40.4, p < 0.0001] \nwith larger responses to the salient central irrelevant stimuli than the tar-\nget stimuli (probably refl ecting the more foveal location of the irrelevant \nstimuli). No signifi cant differences were found in the main factor of per-\nceptual load [F(1,18) = 2.11, p = 0.16] although numerically amplitudes \nwere larger in the low load condition. The predicted interaction between \nperceptual load and stimulus type was not signifi cant [F(1,18) = 0.09, \np = 0.77].\nThe N1 data were subjected to a three-factor 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 repeated meas-\nures ANOVA, the waveforms at locations used to identify the N1 are shown \nin Figure 3. The factors were hemisphere (left\/right), perceptual load (low\/\nhigh), stimulus type (target\/irrelevant). Analysis of the N1 data revealed \nno difference between the main factors of hemisphere [F(1,18) = 2.12, \np = 0.16] and perceptual load [F(1,18) = 0.22, p = 0.65]. However, there \nwas a major effect of stimulus type [F(1,18) = 76.7, p < 0.0001], poten-\ntially due to the different salience and eccentricity of the target and irrel-\nevant stimuli. However, the predicted interaction between perceptual load \nand stimulus type proved signifi cant [F(1,18) = 5.99, p < 0.025], with \neffects in the predicted direction (See Figure 2). No other interactions \nwere signifi cant.\nTo understand the time-course and topography of the interaction, we \nplotted topographic t-test maps for this comparison (based on a contrast \nbetween relevant and irrelevant difference waves, where the difference \nwave was generated by subtracting each individual\u2019s high load wave-\nform from their low load waveform). Sample plots from representative \ntime-points are shown in Figure 4, with electrodes showing a statistically \nsignifi cant difference shown in bold (p < 0.05). This analysis revealed a \nrelatively left lateralized response in the 180\u2013224 ms time range followed \nby a bilateral and sustained difference in the 260\u2013300 ms post-stimulus \nonset time range.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we found that the N1 component and subsequent nega-\ntivity is modulated as predicted by Lavie\u2019s model of perceptual load \n(Lavie, 1995; Lavie and Robertson, 2001; Lavie and Tsal, 1994): relevant \ninformation shows stronger responses with increasing perceptual load \nwhile irrelevant information shows weaker responses as perceptual load \nincreases. Thus, to the extent that the N1 component can be character-\nized as a measure of perceptual processing, we have provided strong \nevidence in support of this perceptual load model of attention.\nOne important aspect of our study is that the irrelevant stimuli were \nalways presented at different times from the target stimuli, and never \nsimultaneously competed for attention with the target stimuli. This is \nin contrast with the work of Rees et al. (1997) and the fi rst experiment \nof Handy et al. (2001), where the irrelevant information was presented \nat the same time as task relevant information. Therefore, in our design \nthere was no direct need to actively inhibit processing of irrelevant \ninformation. This has important theoretical implications. Specifi cally, \nthe previous results may encourage active inhibition of distractors, \nwhile our design refl ects a purer measure of inattention due to limited \ncapacity.\nIn the work by Handy and colleagues, the P1 component was taken \nas the key measure of processing. The pattern of our P1 components \nis similar to that reported by Handy et al. (2001), but our design allows \nadditional comparisons that do not support their inferences. Specifi cally, \nFigure 3. The N1 components from this study. Note that the increased \nperceptual load results in larger N1 responses to target stimuli, but that there \nis a decrease to distractor stimuli. The top row of plots shows ERPs to the tar-\nget stimuli where the participant was expected to make a gap judgment. The \nlower row shows ERPs to the irrelevant but salient central distractor stimuli. \nThe horizontal axis shows time, beginning 100 ms prior to stimulus onset and \ncontinuing until 500 ms after onset, while the vertical axis shows the voltage \n(with a range from +5 to \u22125 \u00b5V).

We found \na numerical trend for this effect in our own data. However, Handy and \ncolleagues did not directly test for the predicted interaction effect where \ntarget items also result in stronger P1 responses during high load com-\npared to low load. Our design allows us to make this comparison, and our \ndata show no evidence of this interaction effect: indeed numerically the \nP1 responses to targets are weaker during high load compared to low \nload. Therefore, in our design perceptual load does not appear to selec-\ntively fi lter relevant information at the time of the very early P1. Handy \ninferred that increasing attentional load results in stronger P1 waveforms \nbased on their earlier work (Handy and Mangun, 2000). However, it is \nworth noting that these earlier fi ndings only found P1 enhancement in \ncertain situations (e.g., only for ipsilateral P1, and in interaction with spa-\ntial cuing). While it is possible that the P1 modulation by load may occur \nwhen stimuli are processed at attended locations, our data suggests that \nthis fi nding does not generalize to all situations.\nAn important difference between our study and those of Handy and \ncolleagues is that our conclusions focus on the N1 component, rather than \nthe P1 as they do. We have shown in this study that the N1 component and \nsubsequent sustained negativity does show the interaction predicted by \nthe perceptual load model. Specifi cally, we fi nd more negative defl ections \nfor relevant information during high perceptual load relative to low load \nwith irrelevant stimuli driving the opposite pattern (i.e., irrelevant stimuli \nresult in more negativity during low load relative to high load). While the \nP1 and N1 modulations are typically seen during spatial selection, the \nlater sustained negativity we observe is similar to the \u2018selection negativ-\nity\u2019 effects that are often seen when participants are asked to attend to \nnon-spatial features such as color, shape and orientation (Eimer, 1997). It \nis probable that the sustained activity we observe refl ects differences of \nprocessing non-spatial features during different levels of perceptual load. \nPrevious work (Hillyard et al., 1998; Mangun and Hillyard, 1991) suggest \nthat P1 modulation is typically observed in spatial selection tasks where \nthere is interference (e.g., where distractors at other locations compete \nfor processing), while N1 modulation refl ects a limited capacity dis-\ncriminative process (e.g., N1 modulation is typically not observed when \nparticipants need to make simple detection responses to salient stimuli, \nbut is observed when they are asked to make discrimination responses). \nLike previous physiological studies of the perceptual load model (Handy \net al., 2001; Rees et al., 1997; Yi et al., 2004), the relevant and irrelevant \ninformation occurred at predictably different locations (e.g., in our study, \nirrelevant information was always foveal, and irrelevant information was \nalways peripheral).\nOur results complement a recent study by Fu et al. (2008) who report \nthat conducted an ERP study of perceptual load. Each trial presented four \nlarge lines, one in each visual quadrant (one vertical, one diagonal, and \ntwo horizontal). The task was to simply report if a forward slanting diago-\nnal line (\u2018\/\u2019) appeared in the attended hemifi eld, while ignoring stimuli in \nthe unattended hemifi eld, with targets occurring in 10% of the trials. Half \nthe trials presented the stimuli on background of x-shaped distractors, \nwhile the other half was presented on a background of small horizon-\ntal and vertical lines. As the targets were diagonal lines, the x-shaped \ndistractors lead to greater perceptual load than the small horizontal \nand vertical lines. The authors report an interaction between voluntary \nattention and perceptual load that was signifi cant for the N1 but not the \nearlier P1 component, with dipole modeling localizing this interaction to \nthe  temporoparietal-occipital gyrus. Specifi cally, the N1 amplitude was \ngreater in the attended than unattended hemifi eld in the high load condi-\ntion but not the low load condition. Further, like our fi ndings, this inter-\naction of negativity is sustained well after the N1 component (see their \nFigure 6). While our conclusions replicate those of Fu et al. (2008), it is \nimportant to note that our paradigm helps address a number of pos-\nsible concerns with their study. For example, their low load and high load \nstimuli are perceptually very different. Further, our fi nding is based on \ndistractors that appear in the absence of potential targets, and therefore \nhighlights the infl uence of anticipated load rather than actual stimulus-\ndriven load. On the other hand, as discussed in their introduction, their \ndesign is much more faithful to the original concept of perceptual load, \nas well as the standard behavioral studies of behavioral load. Therefore, \nwe believe that the present study both replicates and extends the work \nof Fu et al. (2008).\nTherefore, the physiological evidence observed to date may show \nearly spatial suppression effects, as measured by the early P1 and N1 \ncomponents. For example, with increasing perceptual load, the partici-\npants may be selectively suppressing perception from the location of \nirrelevant information. We predict that future ERP studies that present \nirrelevant and relevant information at unpredictable or superimposed \nlocations will not observe differences in the P1 (e.g., Handy et al., 2001) \nor N1 (as we observe here), but will replicate our sustained negativity \neffects. In other words, based on work reviewed by Hillyard et al. (1998), \nwe suggest that the early P1 and N1 effects are products of the predict-\nable  location of relevant and irrelevant information.\nA consistent fi nding of ERP studies is that stimuli presented at attended \nlocations show enhanced amplitude P1 and N1 components relative to \nunattended items (Mangun and Hillyard, 1995). Typically, these studies \nhave presented peripheral items in both the left and right hemifi elds while \nsubjects are instructed to attend to one side. These studies have demon-\nstrated that the earliest C1 components are not infl uenced by attention \n(i.e., the amplitude and latency of the C1 is identical in both conditions) \nwhile the amplitude of the P1 and N1 components are modulated by atten-\ntion (Clark and Hillyard, 1996; Gomez Gonzales et al., 1994; Mangun et al., \n1993). These fi ndings support a fairly early level of selection \u2013 with signals \nfrom attended versus unattended stimuli being differentiated within 80 ms \nof stimulus onset (Luck et al., 2000; Mangun and Hillyard, 1995).\nIt should be noted that none of the physiological studies of Lavie\u2019s \nload model have directly tested the notion that under low load atten-\ntion to distractor stimuli is obligatory. Previous behavioral studies have \ndemonstrated that the effect of interfering distractors is actually reduced \nas perceptual load increases (Lavie, 2005). In contrast, all of the physi-\nological studies have used task irrelevant distractors. Therefore, there are \ntwo interpretations for the physiological data. First, it is possible that the \nload model is correct, and residual processing is required to be processed \nunder low load. Second, it is conceivable that under low load the bored \nparticipants voluntarily choose to attend to the irrelevant material, poten-\ntially because they do not fi nd the task challenging. To directly test this, \nfuture studies need to compare high and low load to situations blocks of \ntrials where the distractors are either irrelevant (neutral) or interfering \nwith the task. If the increased processing of distractors under low load \nis under voluntary control, this should not occur when one expects the \ndistractors to interfere with the primary task.\nEarly selection models argue that attended items are processed dif-\nferently from unattended items even at the earliest stages of perception. \nIndeed, both our research and previous studies show that the P1 and \nN1 are already showing signifi cant modulation based on task demands. \nHowever, it should be noted that many cognitive psychologists consider \nlate versus early selection a simplisitc dichotomy, arguing that task \ndemands (Johnston and Heinz, 1978), attenuation (Treisman, 1969) and \nperceptual capacity (Kahneman, 1973; Lavie, 1995; Lavie and Tsal, 1994) \noffer clearer models of attentional infl uences on perception. Previous \nstudies have demonstrated that ERPs can give unambiguous evidence in \nfavor of some form of early selection. In a similar fashion, we believe that \nour paradigm offers support for Lavie\u2019s perceptual load model.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of \nany commercial or fi nancial relationships that could be construed as a \npotential confl ict of interest.\nPerceptual load modulates ERPs\nwww.frontiersin.org\n7\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of \nHealth to Chris Rorden (R01-NS054266) and to Gordon C.
