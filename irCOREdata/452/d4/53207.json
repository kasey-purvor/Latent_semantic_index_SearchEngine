Introduction \nOver recent years the high power diode laser (HPDL) has shown itself to be a viable tool for the processing \nof many materials. It is therefore imperative that a variety of comparative studies between the HPDL and \nother industrial lasers are conducted. This paper essentially compares the effects of wavelength differences \nbetween a CO2 and a HPDL and the effects thereof on the lasers\u2019 absorption lengths in an Al2O3\/SiO2-based \nrefractory material. Previously Schmidt et al. [1] compared the performance of CO2, excimer and HPDL in \nthe removal of chlorinated rubber coatings from concrete surfaces, noting wavelength dependant \ndifferences in the process performance. Additionally, Bradley et al. [2] compared the CO2 and HPDL for \nthe treatment of Al2O3-based refractory materials in terms of microstructure, observing wavelength \ndependant microstructural characteristics unique to each laser. In more comprehensive investigations, \nLawrence et al. compared the effects of CO2, Nd:YAG, excimer and HPDL radiation on the wettability \ncharacteristics of a SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic [3, 4] and a mild steel [5, 6], noting that in all instances, \nchanges in the wettability characteristics of the material varied depending upon the laser type. \nThe quantity of published literature to date attests to the fact that the laser surface treatment of ceramic \nmaterials is an active field of research. The treatment of both bulk ceramics [7-11] and ceramic coatings \n[12-15] has been reported. The knowledge of how far a laser beam is absorbed by a material\u2019s surface is    \nof fundamental interest, since the outcomes of many laser processing procedures are intrinsically influenced \n*Corresponding author: tel: +44 161 236-3311; fax: +44 161 200-3803; e-mail: j.lawrence@umist.ac.uk \n  2 \nby this parameter. Indeed, such information is essential to scientists and engineers interested in the laser \nprocessing of ceramic materials. Notwithstanding this, only a limited amount of published work exists \npertaining to the determination of the absorption length of laser beams in ceramic materials. Although not \ndirectly using the method described in this paper to determine laser beam absorption length, namely the \napplication of Beer-Lambert\u2019s law, the fundamental theory behind the method was employed by a number \nof workers. Andrew et al. [16] used the method to ascertain the minimum fluence required to etch \npolymeric materials. Schmidt et al. [1] utilised the method to calculate the thermal loading of chlorinated \nrubber during CO2 and HPDL treatment. \nThis paper describes for the first time the determination of the absorption length of CO2 and HPDL \nradiation in an Al2O3\/SiO2-based refractory through the application of Beer-Lambert\u2019s law. The refractory \nmaterial studied is used commercially as a lining in industrial furnaces and incinerators. Moreover, the \nmethod of employing Beer-Lambert\u2019s law for the determination of laser beam absorption length, which has \nhitherto been used predominantly with lasers operated in the pulsed mode, is shown to be valid for use with \nlasers operated in the continuous wave (CW) mode depending upon the material being treated. \n2. Experimental procedures \nIn order to obtain results of a practical and useful nature, the material used in the experiments was an \nAl2O3\/SiO2-based refractory containing various impurities. The composition by weight of the refractory is \nas follows: Al2O3 (83.5%), SiO2 (9%), Cr2O3 (4.5%), P2O5 (1.8%), Fe2O3 (0.4%), TiO2 (0.3%), MgO \n(0.3%), NaO2 (0.2%), CaO (0.1%) and K2O (0.1%). The refractory material studied is used commercially as \na lining in industrial furnaces and incinerators. The refractory was obtained (from Cleanaway Ltd.) in the \nform of blocks (200 x 200 x 100 mm\n3\n). For the purpose of experimental convenience the as-received \nrefractory blocks were sectioned into small cubes (20 x 20 x 10 mm\n3\n) prior to laser treatment. The \nrefractory was treated with both lasers at room temperature and in normal atmospheric conditions. \nThe work was completed using a CO2 laser (Rofin-Sinar GmBh) emitting at 10.6 \u00b5m with a maximum \noutput power of  1 kW and a HPDL (Diomed Ltd.) emitting at 810\u00b120 nm with a maximum output power \nof 120 W. The CO2 laser beam was delivered to the work surface by focusing the beam through a 150 mm \nfocal length KC1 lens to give a stable diverging beam. The HPDL beam was delivered to the work area by \nmeans of a 4 m long, 600 \u00b5m core diameter optical fibre, the end of which was connected to a 2:1 focusing \nlens assembly. In both instances the laser optics were protected by means of a coaxially blown Ar shield gas \njet a rate of 5 l min\n-1\n. Both lasers produced a multi-mode beam. The laser fluences were set such that no \nmelting occurred. The absence of melting was verified by subjecting the irradiated areas to an x-ray \ndiffraction (XRD) to ensure the refractory retained its crystallinity.  \n3. Results and discussion \nAs one can see from Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b), the ablation depth rate per shot, h, for the surface of the \nrefractory irradiated with both lasers was seen to exhibit a logarithmic dependence on the laser fluence, E. \nAn optical profiling system (ProScan) was employed to determine the values of h for the various values        \nof E. It is evident from both Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) that a threshold for discernible material removal exists, \nwith the minimum required fluence being approximately 91 J cm\n-2\n for the CO2 laser and approximately    \n142 J cm\n-2\n for the HPDL.  \n  3 \n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1 10 100 1000 10000\nCO2 Laser Fluence, E (J\/cm\n2\n)\nR\nem\no\nv\na\nl \nR\na\nte\n, \nh\n (\n\u00b5\u00b5 \u00b5\u00b5\nm\n\/s\nh\no\nt)\n   \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n1 10 100 1000 10000\nHPDL Fluence, E (J\/cm\n2\n)\nR\nem\no\nv\na\nl \nR\na\nte\n, \nh\n (\n\u00b5\u00b5 \u00b5\u00b5\nm\n\/s\nh\no\nt)\n \nFig. 1. Removal rate per shot, h, as a function of (a) CO2 and (b) HPDL laser fluence, E. \n \nAlthough this approach has been adopted previously to examine pulsed lasers (excimer) and shown to be \nsound [16], the technique has also been used to investigate CW lasers [1, 17]. Moreover, the distinct \nlinearity of the data points further validates the use of this approach for the examination of CW lasers. It is \nimportant to note that this would assume a minimum conduction loss. However, the Al2O3\/SiO2-based \nrefractory has relatively low thermal conductivity (3.25 W\/mK), thus it is reasonable to suppose the laser \npower densities used were high enough and the pulses short enough to minimise the thermal conduction \nloss. \nSince the energy deposition profile will be governed by the optical absorption coefficient, \u03b1, then the depth \nof material removed per shot, h, is given by Beer-Lambert\u2019s law: \n h\nE\nE\nt\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n1\n\u03b1\nln  (1) \nwhere, Et, is the threshold value of the fluence at which significant material removal occurs and is defined \nas [16] \n \n( )\nE\nH C T\nR\nt\np d=\n+\n\u2212\n\u03c1\n\u03b1 1\n (2) \nHere, H is the latent heat of fusion, \u03c1 the density, Cp the specific heat and R the reflectivity. Td is some \ncritical temperature at which rapid thermal degradation of the material occurs leading to the production of \nvolatile fragments within the thermal time scale of the experiments. It is important to note that Eq. (1) takes \nno account of absorption of incident radiation by the plume of removed material and likely changes in the \nmaterial\u2019s level of absorption as removal progresses. Nonetheless, as the work of Andrew et al. [16] and \nSchmidt et al. [1] demonstrated, this simple form of the expression is quite adequate as a first \napproximation. By rearranging Eq. (1) in terms of the absorption length, 1\/\u03b1, thus: \n \n1\n\u03b1\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\nh\nE\nE\nt\nln\n (3) \nthen it is possible to determine the absorption length of both CO2 and HPDL radiation into the surface of \nthe Al2O3\/SiO2-based refractory. By introducing the ablation depth rate per shot, h, and the corresponding \n  4 \nvalue of laser fluence, E, for each data point into Eq. (3) it was possible to calculate the average absorption \nlength for each laser under the actual experimental conditions. These were found to be 1\/\u03b1=345\u00b122 \u00b5m for \nthe CO2 laser and 1\/\u03b1=198\u00b115 \u00b5m for the HPDL. \nThe principal factors that may influence the melt depth differences are arguably the absorption length and \nthe actual absorptivity of the surface of the Al2O3\/SiO2-based refractory. But, absorptivity measurements \nmade at room temperature using a comparative technique detailed elsewhere [18] revealed that the surface \nof the Al2O3\/SiO2-based refractory absorbed around 62% of CO2 laser radiation and around 58% of HPDL \nradiation. \n4. Conclusions \nBy employing Beer-Lambert\u2019s law, the laser beam absorption lengths of CO2 and a high power diode laser \n(HPDL) radiation for the Al2O3\/SiO2-based refractory were determined. The absorption lengths for the \nAl2O3\/SiO2-based refractory of CO2 and a HPDL radiation were 345\u00b122 \u00b5m and 198\u00b115 \u00b5m respectively. \nThe principal factors that may influence the melt depth differences are arguably the absorption length and \nthe actual absorptivity of the surface of the Al2O3\/SiO2-based refractory. But, absorptivity measurements \nmade at room temperature using a comparative revealed that the surface of the Al2O3\/SiO2-based refractory \nabsorbed around 62% of CO2 laser radiation and around 58% of HPDL radiation. Thus, since these figures \nare similar, it is reasonable to assume that absorption length is the principal influence on the melt depth. \nReferences \n1. M.J.J. Schmidt, L. Li, J.T. Spencer, Appl.
