To characterise\nthe material we include the averaged values of density and velocity and introduce variables to\ndescribe the mean direction, alignment and entanglement. We assume that the bulk stress of\nthe material depends on the density, entanglement, degree of alignment, average direction and\nshear-rates. A kinematic equation for average direction and two proposed heuristic laws for the\nevolution of entanglement and degree of alignment are given to close the system. Extensional\nand shearing simulations are in good qualitative agreement with experimental results.\n1 Introduction\n1.1 Industrial background\nThe fundamental operations of yarn manufacture are carding, drawing, twisting and\nspinning. Carding transforms the raw material, such as cotton, wool or polyester, into a\nsmooth coherent web disentangling, ordering and eliminating unwanted materials. The\nname for this process comes from the Latin for a thistle plant, as these were once used\nto tease and order handfuls of fibres. Although manufacturing technology has improved\nthe speed and efficiency of the process, the underlying principles have not changed; now\nmachines use huge arrays of hooks that travel at speeds of up to 100 m\/s.\nThe forces applied to transform the disordered, entangled body of fibres during the\ncarding process result in interconnected fibre structures being continually teased apart\ninto individual fibres [8, 17]. Therefore most of the activity results in permanent non-\nrecoverable changes in the internal orientation of the fibre medium. The transport of\nfibres relative to one another is crucial if one is to engage in good carding practice.\nThere are two detrimental effects of the carding process that undermine yarn manu-\nfacture. The first is that stresses generated in the machines can cause fibres to break:\nshorter fibres reduce the implicit strength of the resulting yarn. The second problem is\nthe production of localised, highly tangled regions called neps, which result in dramatic\ndensity irregularities that are subsequently difficult to eliminate. Another inherent problem\nwhen dealing with textile fibres is the diversity of raw materials used in the industry. For\nexample, the surfaces of fibres vary from smooth to crenulated, some fibres have frictional\n146 M. E. M. Lee and H. Ockendon\nproperties that depend on direction, and there are other differences in geometry and\nmechanics. With all this in mind the aim of the carding machine designers is to produce\na single machine that can cope with any textile fibre and it is the understanding of this\nprocess and its dependence on the parameters that we seek.\n1.2 Modelling objectives\nIn this paper we present a continuum model for an array of fibres that includes the evol-\nution of fibre orientations and the degree of entanglement. Understanding how the fibre\norientations change relative to one another during the carding process will aid the develop-\nment of future machines and the optimisation of the process. This along with a number\nof other models of the carding process has been addressed by Lee [18].\n2 The model\n2.1 Preamble\nParticles suspended in fluid have attracted the interest of applied mathematicians, es-\npecially the dilute or semi-dilute limits where particles do not interact or only interact\nhydrodynamically; see, for example, Batchelor [3] and Hinch & Leal [13, 14]. Using a\nsimilar approach where the bulk stress consists of both hydrodynamic and particulate\ncontributions Spencer [25] has modelled fibre-reinforced fluids. Toll et al. [26, 27, 28]\nconsidered densely packed fibres where the dominant forces are due to fibre-fibre interac-\ntions, although a planar constraint used in the derivation of the model is not applicable\nto fibre dynamics in the carding machine.\nOther specific studies that include nematic particles such as polymers and liquid crystals\nare described by Doi & Edwards [9] and Ericksen [10] and Leslie [19], respectively. The\nstudy of dense polymer chains and concepts such as the paradigm tube model consider\nlarge nematic molecules in a state of thermal agitation and so the underlying mechanics is\nquite different although the geometry is very similar to the problem considered here. Liquid\ncrystal models employ two variables that we will later adopt: the mean crystal (in our\ncontext, fibre) direction, called the director, and the degree of crystal alignment, called the\norder parameter; our order parameter measures the degree to which the material has been\ncarded. Although the director and order parameter are a very useful way of describing the\nmaterial we cannot take the analogy with liquid crystals too much farther. In particular\nthe internal forces here are quite different to those in liquid crystals and our approach to\nmodelling the dynamics of the fibres is based on ideas from the theory of fibre suspensions.\nBuckley [4] has suggested using an anisotropic visco-elastic continuum to represent\nthe bulk stress of a fibre-medium. This means that the material has historical recovery\nand relaxation time-scales, the ratio of which forms the Deborah number. A number of\nauthors [16, 22, 24] have employed the theory of dilute fibre suspensions, which can be\napplied to the parts of the carding process where entanglements have been eliminated and\nthe density has been significantly reduced.\nAnother approach to modelling the carding process is to ignore \u201cmicro-scale\u201d mechanics\nbetween individual fibres, and consider more global or \u201cmacroscopic\u201d variables such as\nA continuum model for entangled fibres 147\ntransfer rates between surfaces. A number of authors [1, 12, 23, 29] use a method that\nindicates the dynamics of fibre densities on each drum induced by prescribed transfer rates.\nCherkassky [5, 6] employs a slightly more complicated model assuming a constant rate of\ntransverse diffusion. For these models it is not easy to relate the theoretical parameters to\nspecific physical parameters such as the fibres\u2019 frictional properties. Furthermore, being\ninformed about transfer rates of fibres and even transverse diffusion does not immediately\nelucidate the dynamics of this textile process or the degree to which the raw material has\nbeen carded.\nIn this paper we derive a model that focuses on the disentangling and ordering of a\nmany-fibre medium. The only significant internal forces are those between neighbouring\nfibres when they slip over one another as they re-orientate. Although the dynamic friction\nproperties of textiles inevitably involve some ad-hoc constitutive laws, we will introduce a\ngeneral framework for a dense, entangled, textile-fibre continuum. Besides using a director\nand an order parameter we will introduce a variable that characterises the entanglement\nof the medium.\n3 Governing equations\nWe have chosen a continuum approach to derive a model which is tractable and applicable\nin the parts of the carding machine in which tufts of fibres are subjected to stress. As\nthe industrial process involves large shear stresses, fibres will slip over one another, and\nwe assume the material to be an anisotropic viscous continuum. We describe the fibre\nmaterial with the following dependent variables and in all cases these are values averaged\nover a small volume containing a large number of fibres: density \u03c1, velocity ui, average\nfibre direction or director ai, order parameter \u03c6 and entanglement \u03ba. The governing\nequations will be composed of a set of nine coupled Eulerian field equations that are:\nconservation laws for mass and momentum, a kinematic equation, and two constitutive\nevolution equations. However, before we go into the details of these equations we shall\ndiscuss two of the less familiar variables: order parameter \u03c6 and entanglement \u03ba.\n3.1 Order parameter\nWe adopt the order parameter from the theory of liquid crystals, as described by de\nGennes & Prost [7]. If \u0398 is the angle between a typical fibre and the unit vector ai, then\nthe degree of alignment or the order parameter can be defined as\n\u03c6(x, t) =\n\u222b\nS\n(\n3 cos2 \u0398 \u2212 1\n2\n)\n\u03c8(x, t, \u0398) dS,\nwhere \u03c8 is a probability density function that gives the probability that a fibre at position\nx makes an angle \u0398 with the director and S is a unit sphere. This definition includes three\ndistinct fibre orientations: \u03c6 = 1 requires all fibres to be aligned, \u03c6 = 0 means that fibre\norientations are random and isotropic and \u03c6 = \u2212 1\n2\nis planar isotropy. In our applications\nwe expect that the order parameter will be non-negative since the fibres will be initially\ndisordered (\u03c6 = 0) and \u03c6 will increase as the material is sheared or stretched. Note that\nin the case where the fibres are isotropic, \u03c6 = 0, the director a is not well defined.\n148 M. E. M. Lee and H. Ockendon\nFigure 1. A 4-fibre braid diagram, the word representing this braid is b1b3b\n\u22121\n2 b\n\u22121\n4 b1.\n3.2 Entanglement variable\nThe inter-fibre topological structure will affect the material\u2019s response to stress. Although\nthe inclusion of this macroscopic variable is heuristic there is a mathematical theory that\ncan be applied to quantify the entanglement of braids. The topology of braids can be\ndefined as a group [2]. One way to visualise the elements of an n-fibre braid group is to\nconsider a braid diagram (see Figure 1). These diagrams are composed of two parallel,\nnon-intersecting, lines denoted M and N, in between which lie the fibre trajectories. The\nbinary operation xy acting on elements of the group, x and y, can be thought of as simply\nattaching the fibre end-points of y at M to those of x at N. The cross-over points between\nfibres in the braid diagram can be arranged so that one can define a set of n \u2212 1 braid\ngenerators {b1, . . . , bn\u22121} where for bi none of the fibres cross-over except for i and i + 1\nstrands, i crosses over i+ 1. A braid can then be represented by a product of generators,\nwhich are called words, and these form elements of an n-fibre braid group. Note that\nby constraining the position of the fibre end-points of a three-dimensional braid, one\nmay construct appropriate homotopic deformations so that a projection onto a plane\ncorresponds to a braid diagram.\nThe following relationships\nbib\n\u22121\ni = 1, bibi+1bi = bi+1bibi+1 and bibj = bjbi \u2200|i \u2212 j| > 2\nnamely, the inverse, the Artin Relationship and far commutivity, can be used to form\nequivalence classes and these correspond to topological equivalence. If one considered an\nelement of a braid group with a large number of generators, possibly appearing to be\nhighly tangled, it could be in the same equivalence class as a braid with fewer generators\nor even the identity braid.\nThe shortest word in each equivalence class gives a good indication of the degree to\nwhich fibres are entangled. The entanglement function \u03ba we use is proportional to the\nlength of the shortest word within its respective equivalence class per unit volume of the\ncontinuum. We thus have a theoretical basis for our concept of \u201centanglement\u201d although\nin practice it would require a considerable amount of effort to estimate the entanglement\nof a particular collection of fibres. However we can still postulate an evolution equation\nfor the macroscopic quantity \u03ba which will allow us to distinguish between tufts of fibres\nin different states of entanglement.\nA continuum model for entangled fibres 149\n3.3 Conservation laws\nUsing the summation convention we write the conservation of mass and linear momentum,\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202xk\n(\u03c1uk) = 0, (3.1)\nFi +\n\u2202\u03c3ik\n\u2202xk\n= 0, (3.2)\nwhere ui are the components of velocity, Fi are body forces and \u03c3ij are the bulk internal\nstresses due to the fibre-fibre interactions. Equation (3.2) is based on the assumption of\nnegligible inertia due to the dominant inter-fibre frictional forces. Typical body forces Fi\ndue to the hooks, electro-statics, airflow and gravity could be included.\n3.3.1 Bulk stress\nThe two factors that give rise to internal forces and bulk structural rigidity are individual\ncontact points between fibres and the orientation of the fibre network. We write the bulk\nstress as\n\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03c3\nI\n\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03c3\nN\n\u03b1\u03b2, (3.3)\nwhere \u03c3I represents the isotropic response to stress when the fibres are randomly aligned\nand \u03c3N incorporates the aligned phase and hence the non-isotropic components due to\nthe directionality of the fibres. When all the fibres are aligned, \u03c6 = 1, we do not expect\nthe isotropic component of the stress \u03c3I to contribute to the bulk stress. Conversely, when\nthe material is randomly orientated, \u03c6 = 0, the directional dependent component of the\nstress \u03c3N should be negligible.\nThe stress tensor will also depend on the degree of entanglement and initially we shall\nassume that the relationship is linear. Equation (3.3) should also depend on a variable\nthat indicates the number of contact points between fibres per unit volume. Komori &\nMakishima [15] have shown that in a randomly orientated collection of fibres the number\nof contact points between fibres is proportional to the square of density.\nFor small strains we expect the bulk stresses for entangled fibres to behave elastically to\nsome degree. Whereas large strains will produce predominantly non-recoverable changes\nand thus a visco-elastic model would seem appropriate. However we eschew this degree\nof complication and present a viscous model which is applicable when the deformations\nare significant. This is satisfactory when considering a model for the carding machine\nas its objective is to dramatically alter intrinsic inter-fibre structure. As a starting point\nwe assume that the stresses are linearly proportional to rates-of-strain and will take the\nform:\n\u03c3I\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03c12\u03ba(1 \u2212 \u03c6) = \u00b51e\u03b1\u03b2 + \u00b52ekk\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2, (3.4)\n\u03c3N\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03c12\u03ba\u03c6\n= \u03bb1e\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03bb2ekk\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03bb3(a\u03b1aie\u03b2i + a\u03b2aiei\u03b1)\n+ \u03bb4(a\u03b1a\u03b2ekk + \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2akalekl) + \u03bb5a\u03b1a\u03b2akalekl (3.5)\n150 M. E. M. Lee and H. Ockendon\nwhere \u00b5i and \u03bbi are constant isotropic and anisotropic viscous coefficients respectively\nand e\u03b1\u03b2 =\n1\n2\n( \u2202u\u03b1\n\u2202x\u03b2\n+\n\u2202u\u03b2\n\u2202x\u03b1\n) is the rate-of-strain tensor. We have assumed that the nematic\nand isotropic components of the stress depend linearly on the order parameter \u03c6 and the\nentanglement \u03ba. Equation (3.5) represents a material that is transversely isotropic. The\ninvariance of the stress tensor under isotropic rotations [11, 20, 25] leads to the particular\nform of the right-hand-side of (3.4) and (3.5), and thus the bulk stress depends on only 7\nparameters \u03bbi, \u00b5i.\n3.4 Kinematic condition\nIn addition to conservation of mass and momentum, there is a kinematic condition to\nbe imposed on the director field. If we consider an element of the fibres in direction ai\nwith length s, and then impose the velocity field ui, the director field is governed by the\nfollowing equation:\n\u2202ai\n\u2202t\n+ uk\n\u2202ai\n\u2202xk\n+\ns\u02d9\ns\nai = ak\n\u2202ui\n\u2202xk\n, (3.6)\nwhere s\u02d9\/s is the rate-of-extension per unit length of the material. To better understand\nthe relationship between the material element length s and magnitude of stresses in the\naverage direction of the fibres ai, we can deduce from (3.6) that\ns\u02d9\ns\n= akal\n\u2202uk\n\u2202xl\n, (3.7)\nas ai is a unit vector. Condition (3.7) could be interpreted as a model for extensible\nparticles but textile fibres are generally inextensible and thus the rate-of-change of our\nmaterial elements s\u02d9\/s represents fibres slipping over one another.\n3.5 Evolution of alignment\nTo encapsulate the behaviour of the alignment field we consider the result of straining\nsome entangled fibres. There are two, not necessarily distinct, phases of interaction: the\nfirst involves the orientation of fibres in the direction of the applied force, where the\ninter-fibre topology remains predominantly unchanged, and in the second phase fibres\nslip over one another destroying the underlying inter-fibre structures. In fact the first\nphase would result in a change for the order parameter and the second phase a change in\nthe entanglement. We conjecture the evolution of the order parameter to be proportional\nto the rate-of-extension of the material element s\u02d9\/s. Constraining the order parameter to\nbe between zero and unity, we suggest the following simple form:\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202t\n+ uk\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202xk\n= \u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03c6) s\u02d9\ns\n, (3.8)\nwhere \u03b2 > 0 is a parameter which we assume to be constant. We could have used other\ndecay rates of \u03c6 but the linear form in (3.8) compares well with experimental results.\nNote that for this model we only consider the case where the fibres are in tension s\u02d9\/s > 0.\nWe can eliminate s by using (3.7) and re-write (3.8) as\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202t\n+ uk\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202xk\n= \u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03c6)akal \u2202uk\n\u2202xl\n. (3.9)\nA continuum model for entangled fibres 151\nThe evolution of the order parameter is thus proportional to the magnitude of the stresses\nin the average fibre direction.\n3.6 Evolution of entanglement\nBy assuming a simple relationship which ensures that the entanglement concentration\nremains positive and by considering the second phase of the simple straining experiment\ndescribed above, we write:\n\u2202\u03ba\n\u2202t\n+ uk\n\u2202\u03ba\n\u2202xk\n= \u2212\u03b1\u03baakal \u2202uk\n\u2202xl\n, (3.10)\nwhere \u03b1 > 0 is a constant parameter. We exclude the possibility of increases in entan-\nglement and the possibility of nep formation which would occur if \u03ba \u2192 \u221e. Note that\nthe elongation of tufts in the carding machine will not always reduce the entanglement\nas some braids will need more than just simple local elongations in the average fibre\ndirection a in order to become less or completely disentangled. Therefore this model is\nonly valid for extensional entanglement-reducing flows. The disentangling process is not\nreversible, so to include increases in entanglement would be more complicated.\nWe now have nine field equations (3.1), (3.2), (3.6), (3.9), (3.10) and close the system\nwith the stress tensor defined in (3.3)\u2013(3.5). Now it remains to test the model and we\nconsider two experiments: elongation and shearing.\n4 Parallel elongational flow\nThe simplest problem which can be devised to test the model is to consider a tuft or group\nof entangled fibres, place parallel clamps on opposing sides, x = 0, l(0), then keeping one\nclamp fixed we elongate the material by moving the other clamp at uniform velocity U,\nsee Figure 2. We expect the initial tuft, or population of tufts, to be randomly orientated\nand in terms of the order parameter this means that \u03c6(t = 0) = \u03c60 \u2248 0. We measure the\nforce as one clamp moves away from the other at uniform speed and use this to compare\nexperiment with the theoretical prediction varying initial tuft lengths l(0) and elongations\nspeeds U.\n4.1 The governing equations\nThe problem can be simplified by constraining the motion to be in one direction, so that\nv, w = 0 and a = i, and the variables depend on space x and time t only. The governing\nequations, (3.1), (3.9) and (3.10), then simplify dramatically to give\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\u03c1u) = 0, (4.1)\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202t\n+ u\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202x\n= \u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03c6)\u2202u\n\u2202x\n, (4.2)\n\u2202\u03ba\n\u2202t\n+ u\n\u2202\u03ba\n\u2202x\n= \u2212\u03b1\u03ba\u2202u\n\u2202x\n, (4.3)\n152 M.

(4.5)\nInitial conditions are required for density, entanglement and order:\n\u03c1(x, 0) = \u03c10(x), \u03ba(x, 0) = \u03ba0(x), \u03c6(x, 0) = \u03c60(x). (4.6)\nNote that this solution automatically satisfies the zero stress condition on the edges as\n\u03c312 = 0 throughout.\n4.3 The solution For a uniformly dense tuft\nThe solution of the differential equations (4.1)\u2013(4.4) with conditions (4.5)\u2013(4.6) in general\nwill have to be computed numerically.

The plots\nwithin each figure correlate to the given values below the respective plots in ascending order and\nfor (a) and (c) we plot (4.7) with \u03ba0 = \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 1, \u03c60 =\nA\nB\n= 10\u22122.\nwhere F is the force exerted at either end of the tuft. The density from equation (4.7)\ntends monotonically to zero as time tends to infinity. The order and entanglement both\ndepend on one parameter, and their respective initial conditions; order tends to 1 and\nentanglement tends to 0 as t \u2192 \u221e. Of course in practice the tuft will have split into two\npieces at some finite time.\n4.4 Comparison with experiment\nAll experiments referred to in this paper were conducted by Dr Mahmoudi at the School\nof Textile Industries, University of Leeds. Two different fibres were used, polyester and\ncotton, and although they are geometrically similar, a micron in diameter and around 30\nor 40 mm in length, one is man-made and has a smooth surface while the other is natural\n154 M. E. M. Lee and H. Ockendon\nand has a hairy surface. The initial tuft sizes were varied and the experimental results are\ndisplayed in figure 3 (b) along with the mathematical prediction of the resistive force (4.7)\nin plot (a) for given values of l(0) and U; assuming that the tufts are initially disordered,\n\u03c60 \u0006 1. Note that for all experimental force plots the tuft weights have been included to\neliminate the differences in cross-sectional areas. The simulations are in good agreement\nwith the experiment, but are less accurate at the beginning of the motion because we have\nignored elastic effects.\nIn a second experiment, the velocity U was varied, see figure 3 plots (c) and (d). It\nis quite likely that the results recorded include some noise, produced by the difficulty in\nobtaining equivalent tufts for each test, and in terms of the model for the same material,\nthe initial order, entanglement and director may differ. All these parameters would also\nsignificantly change the mathematical simulation. Regardless of the possibly spurious\ncomparative data the qualitative shape of the curves are similar in the variable velocity\nsimulations.\nThe predicted theoretical force produced at the moving boundary as a consequence of\nthe uniform elongation is given in equation (4.7). The maximum value for F occurs at\nU\nl(0)\ntmax =\n(\n(1 \u2212 A\/B)(1 \u2212 \u03c60)(3 + \u03b1+ \u03b2)\n3 + \u03b1\n) 1\n\u03b2 \u2212 1.\nOne condition for a maximum to exist when tmax \u0001 0 is A < B, and this means that\nthe aligned viscosities should dominate over the isotropic viscosities in terms of their\nrespective contributions to the bulk stress. Moreover, we require\n(1 \u2212 A\/B)(1 \u2212 \u03c60) > 3 + \u03b1\n3 + \u03b1+ \u03b2\n, (4.8)\nand as the disparity in the inequality (4.8) increases, tmax moves away from the origin,\nhence it seemed appropriate to choose A\/B = 10\u22122 in the model simulations in figure 3.\nFor a material where \u03b1, \u03b2, A and B are given then the initial order of the material\nis the only parameter that influences the position of the maximum, whereas the initial\nentanglement affects the magnitude of the resistive force linearly since the height of the\nmaximum is\nFmax =\nB\u03ba0\u03c1\n2\n0U\nl(0)\n(\n3 + \u03b1\n(1 \u2212 A\/B)(1 \u2212 \u03c60)(3 + \u03b1+ \u03b2)\n) 3+\u03b1\n\u03b2\n(\n\u03b2\n3 + \u03b1+ \u03b2\n)\n.\nThe qualitative comparison between experiment and mathematical simulation are good.\nWe have simply chosen \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03ba0 = 1 and B to match the greatest force magnitudes\nin corresponding mathematical and experimental results, however one could use more\ndetailed experimental studies to estimate the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, A, B and \u03ba0 for a chosen\nmaterial.\n5 Parallel shear flow\nWe continue testing the mathematical model by considering a shearing problem (see\nFigure 4). The material is now sheared by two parallel solid boundaries. In the experiment\nA continuum model for entangled fibres 155\nFigure 4. A diagram of the shearing problem.\ntwo hooked carding surfaces were used to produce a shear stress across the tuft, one\nmoving the other stationary. The force was measured as the moving surface travelled at\nuniform velocity. One method of modelling the \u201cshear force\u201d experiment is to consider the\nhooks as a body force Fi, and this is similar to ideas used by Ockendon & Terrill [21] for\na viscosity dominated Newtonian fluid moving through an array of long tethered fibres.\nHowever we shall neglect the effect of hooks in this article and address a simple channel\nflow.\n5.1 The governing equations\nWe consider the planar problem where w = 0 and the director is written as (a1, a2, 0) =\n(cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8, 0)T , we assume that the initial state is uniform in x and thus the solution will\ndepend only on variations in time and in y.

(5.6)\n156 M. E. M. Lee and H. Ockendon\nThe boundary conditions are that there is no-slip at the solid boundaries y = 0 and y = h\nand initial conditions are given for density, order, the director and entanglement:\nu = 0, v = 0 at y = 0, u = U, v = 0 at y = h, (5.7)\n\u03ba(y, 0) = \u03ba0(y), \u03b8(y, 0) = \u03b80(y), \u03c6(y, 0) = \u03c60(y), \u03c1(y, 0) = \u03c10(y), (5.8)\nand these are sufficient conditions to determine the solution of equations (5.1)\u2013(5.6). Unlike\nthe parallel elongation problem in \u00a7 4, where we had to impose a zero-stress condition\ntransverse to the direction of elongation, we have a solid boundary that eliminates this\nproblem, allowing \u03c322\u0001 0. The no-slip condition (5.7) is an approximation because the\nfibres are not clamped to the moving surfaces as they were in the parallel elongational\nflow problem, but they are attached to the hooks on each surface. In the experiment the\nfibres will begin to slip over the hooks as the density and entanglement decrease.\n5.2 The solution\nWhen we have constant initial conditions, we find that there is a solution for the governing\nequations (5.1)\u2013(5.6), in which v = 0 and \u03ba, \u03c6 and \u03b8 are only time dependent. This allows\nus to integrate both equations (5.5) and (5.6) with respect to y and applying the boundary\nconditions (5.7) gives a simple linear velocity profile,\nu = y\nU\nh\n. (5.9)\nNow, with equation (5.9), the partial differential equations in (5.2)\u2013(5.4) become ordinary\ndifferential equations in time with the solution\n\u03b8 = arccot\n(\nU\nh\nt+ cot \u03b80\n)\n, (5.10)\n\u03c6 = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c60)\n[\nh2(1 + cot2 \u03b80)\nh2 + (h cot \u03b80 +Ut)\n2\n] \u03b2\n2\n(5.11)\n\u03ba = \u03ba0\n(\n1 \u2212 \u03c60\n1 \u2212 \u03c6\n) \u03b1\n\u03b2\n= \u03ba0\n[\nh(1 + cot2 \u03b80)\nh2 + (h cot \u03b80 +Ut)\n2\n] \u03b1\n2\n. (5.12)\nThe director from (5.10), regardless of initial condition, will always tend to align itself\nparallel to the shearing boundaries. Order from (5.11) evolves to the aligned phase \u03c6 = 1\nbut the rate at which it evolves depends on the initial director \u03b80 and the initial order \u03c60.\nSimilarly for the entanglement in (5.12), we see an evolution that eliminates knottedness\nbut the rate at which this occurs depends on the initial director.

Now it remains to compare\nthe results with experimental data.\n5.3 Comparison with experiments\nAs in \u00a7 4, the experiments were conducted on cotton and polyester tufts, and so we use\nthe result that the anisotropic viscosities dominate their isotropic counterparts \u00b51\n\u03bb3\n= 0\n158 M. E. M. Lee and H. Ockendon\nand employ similar assumptions that \u03c60 = 0, \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 1 and choose a \u03bb3 so that\nthe magnitude of the greatest forces are approximately equivalent. The experimental\nmeasurements illustrated in Figures 5 (a), (b) and (c) show results for different shearing\nspeeds U, and each figure includes three plots where the distance between hook tips have\nvaried by increments of 7.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 m (h \u223c 10\u22122 cm). In Figure 5 (d) we have plotted\nthree forces (5.13) for velocities U = 5\n6\n, 10\n6\n, 20\n6\n\u00d7 10\u22123 m\/s. For clarity we have chosen not\nto include additional plots where the hook distances and ultimately the channel width h\nvaries by O(10\u22125)m as these result in relatively small changes in the predicted force.\nThe comparisons juxtaposed in Figure 5 are in good qualitative agreement. In particular,\nwhen comparing (a), (b) and (c) with (d) we see that the maxima approximately depend\nlinearly on U. Additionally equation (5.13) predicts force to be inversely proportional to\nchannel width h, and this can be seen to some extent in each experimental plot with fixed\nshear speed where the higher curves correspond to the smaller gap widths. However the\ndifficulty of getting precise results from these experiments mean that we can only ascertain\ngeneral trends.\nA qualitative difference between the shearing experiments in Figure 5 and elongation\nexperiments in Figure 3 is a more gradual increase to the maxima in the shearing\nexperiment. This difference is also predicted by the mathematical model and is due to\nthe director (5.10) not being initially aligned with the parallel shearing boundaries. The\nqualitative initial shape of the force plots are captured well by the model even though we\nhave ignored elastic effects.\nThe main discrepancy when comparing the mathematical prediction and experiment in\nFigure 5 is that the experimental graphs show a greater decrease in the measured force\nafter their respective maximums are reached. We can account for this as the mathematical\nmodel is based on an infinite channel of fibrous material and the experiments are conducted\nwith tufts, which are just finite clusters of fibres. Furthermore, we have imposed a no-\nslip condition on each boundary that will be violated once the density or entanglement\ndecreases significantly.\n6 Conclusions\nIn this paper, we have proposed a new continuum model for a medium composed\nof entangled fibres. Simplifications resulted from the assumptions that deformations in\ninter-fibre topology and structure were non-recoverable, friction between fibres domin-\nated hydrodynamic forces and the fibres were always under tension. The resulting field\nequations (3.1)\u2013(3.6), (3.9) and (3.10) govern an anisotropic viscous medium that was\ncharacterised by density, velocity, direction, order and entanglement. We have introduced\nthree constitutive laws for the bulk stress, alignment and entanglement, and also suggested\nhow braid groups can, in theory, be used to quantify entanglement density. The model\u2019s\npredictions were generally in good agreement with shearing and elongation experiments\nwhere velocities and lengthscales were varied.\nAcknowledgements\nWe wish to express our gratitude to the EPSRC and Crosrol Ltd. who funded the\ninterdisciplinary project, grant number GR\/L62153, under which this work was completed.\nA continuum model for entangled fibres 159\nWe are grateful to Prof. Carl Lawrence, Dr. Mahmoudi, Dr. Iype, Dr. Abbas and Mr.\nGreenwood of the Department of Textile Industries, University of Leeds for introducing\nus to the carding machine and many useful discussions.
