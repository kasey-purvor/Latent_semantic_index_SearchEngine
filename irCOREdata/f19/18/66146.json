I particularly discuss externalist views of meaning, \non which meaning crucially depends on a notion of reference, and ask whether reference \nshould be thought of as cause or effect. Is the meaning of a word explained by what it refers \nto, or should we say that what we use a word to refer to is explained by what concept it \nexpresses? I argue for the latter view, which I call \u201cDarwinian\u201d, and against the former, \n\u201cSpencerian\u201d one, assuming conceptual structures in humans to be an instance of adaptive \nstructures, and adaptive relations to an environment to be the effect rather than the cause of \nevolutionary novelties. I conclude with the deficiency \u2013 both empirically and \nmethodologically \u2013 of a functionalist study of human concepts and the languages they are \nembedded in, as it would be undertaken in a paradigm that identifies meaning with reference \nor that gives reference an explanatory role to play for what concepts we have. \n \n1. Introduction: Function and Genesis \nI will consider a pair of theses about concepts, locating the notion of a concept in a rather \nbroad and biological context: every species has certain abilities dependent on certain internal \ncognitive resources, and concepts in particular. Thus, e.g., both human and non-human \nprimates represent numerical content, communicate, and form social relations, all of which \ndepends on certain concepts. But no matter what training effort is made, all and only humans \nhave the full concept of an integer, develop a \u2018theory of mind\u2019 depending on a repertoire of \nmental state concepts, and exhibit sensitivity to phrase structures as underlying human \nlanguage (see Carey 2004, Fitch and Hauser 2004).  \nFor each concept, then, that a species can form, we can ask about (i) its genesis (where \nit comes from, how it comes into existence), and (ii) how it functions (what it is used to refer \nto). While genesis and function seem distinct enough conceptually, we may well be tempted \nto explain the one in terms of the other. The following two theses capture this wide-spread \ntemptation:  \n(1) An organism O comes to have a concept, C, of some thing, X, because of \nfunctional relations that O takes up in relation to X.  \n(2) How O\u2019s concept, C, of some thing, X, functions in relation to X, is explained by \nhow O came to have C.  \nThe first thesis explains the genesis of O\u2019s internal concepts \u2013 where they come from or what \nbrought them into being \u2013 by how they function or what they mean in an environment: \nfunction explains genesis. The second explains how a concept functions \u2013 what it means \u2013 \nfrom its genesis \u2013 or where it comes from: genesis explains function.  \nI will deny both theses, but before doing that let me note that both sound quite natural. \nTake our concept of a doorknob, made famous through Fodor\u2019s (1998) discussion of it. What, \nexcept for doorknobs, and how we related to them functionally or causally, could possibly \nexplain why we come to have a concept of doorknobs (how that concept came into being)? In \nfact, that appears to be a basic empiricist intuition. And what if not where a concept comes \nfrom or how it arises should explain what doorknob, as we use that word, means or refers to \n(how it functions)? The opposing thesis I explore and defend is this: \n(3) The functional relations to some thing, X, that O takes up by virtue of some \nconcept, C, do not explain how C comes into existence, and are not explained by \nhow C comes into existence.  \n                                                 \n1 I am deeply obliged to two anonymous referees from B&P, and particularly the editor for their very useful \ncomments. I am equally highly indebted to Maria E. Kronfeldner for effectively inspiring the whole project. \n 2\nThe first conjunct breaks a causal-explanatory path from function to genesis. While a \nconcept\u2019s adaptiveness (functionality) may explain why it is selected, maintained, or \nproliferated, it does not explain why it came into being, and hence exists. This thesis excludes \na causal theory of meaning, if understood in the following terms. Let reference be a relation \nbetween a word and a thing in the world, understood as something that determines the \nmeaning of the word. Suppose further a causal analysis of that notion of reference, on which \nthe meaning of water, say, as based on that reference will arise from our causal relations to \nwater \u2013 the substance found in our environment on earth. On this view, the latter and how we \nrelate to it will decide what our word water means, or what concept it expresses.  \nAgain this view is intuitively plausible, for one should think that were it not for the \nexistence of water, how we deal with it and are causally affected by it, we would not have \ncome to have our concept of water. Hence our standing in these relationships to water, the \nsubstance, is surely at least a necessary condition for our coming to possess the concept of \nwater; one might even be inclined to go for the stronger view that it is sufficient (where else \nare such concepts supposed to come from, one might ask). But the third thesis suggests that \nthis is a non sequitur: while there is an important connection between meaning (concepts) and \nreferential function, the latter is not explanatory for the former; and how our word water \nfunctions in respect to water, the substance, may not even be a necessary condition for the \norigins of that concept, hence our having it (although it is, trivially, a necessary condition for \nit to function as it does). We might come to live in an environment in which there was no \nwater, or even a similar-looking substance. Then there is no more reason that we would not \nhave the concept of water (leaving aside the question of whether we had been alive in this \nenvironment), than there is for a cave-dwelling animal that never sees the light not to actually \nhave eyes.  \nWhile that analogy points to standard cases of \u201cDarwinian theft\u201d, I will argue that \nthere may be a deeper reason why water, the substance, and relations to it may not be \nnecessary for the origins of our concept of water. There are general arguments from the \nstructure of Darwinian evolutionary theory that not only break the explanatory path from \nfunction to organismic structure, but according to which structures may be said to have \nfunctions even though these were never enacted in the creature\u2019s phylogenetic past. That a \nconcept can be used to talk about water, the substance \u2013 could function in that fashion \u2013 is, on \nthe same grounds, neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the concept to come into \nexistence (see section 2).  \nThe other half of the conjunctive claim (3) states that how a concept came into being \nneed not explain how it functions with respect to an environment and things occurring in it. \nThis viewpoint should be familiar from a Darwinian perspective, since in the latter the \nfunctioning of any given organismic structure that enters the evolutionary scene may vary. \nWhich function(s) it will come to subserve in its evolutionary history will depend on \naccidents of a multifarious and unpredictable kind. Evolution has no foresight and often \nproves weird. The story of the jawbone is a famous example (and no exceptional case). We \nsee it being used for cracking in reptiles, but also for hearing in mammals, and with other \nfunctions still. What function does it, as such or as a particular organismic structure, subserve \nintrinsically?2 The question seems to have no factual answer, and in this sense, there is no \nintrinsic connection between structure and function. A given structure may have multiple \nfunctions, and it has these functions usually not as an isolated structure, but as a part of some \nfunctional whole, so that it is unclear to what the function should be ascribed. There may be a \n                                                 \n2 I here understand function to mean \u201cselected effect\u201d function. On the understanding of function as \u201ccausal role\u201d \nas conceived by Amundson and Lauder (1994), the relation between a structure and its function is equally not \nintrinsic, and in a more obvious way: the notion of function plays no explanatory role, it is nothing that is \nindependent from the structure as some given \u201cpurpose\u201d of it, relative to which it can then be rationalized (ibid., \n234-6). \n 3\nsingle function associated with a given structure and no change of it, but even that may be for \nsome accident of history, and the function will still not be something given when the genesis \nis given, or determined by it. Of course, the same function may also be subserved by \nanatomically very different structures.  \nThe view denied in (3) is not, I will argue, \u201cDarwinian\u201d, but, as I will say, \n\u201cSpencerian\u201d. Far from having been superseded by the history of biology, the Darwin-\nSpencer dichotomy seems strangely alive in current thinking about human meaning and mind. \nWhile in the biology of \u201cbodily\u201d function, Spencerism is little more than a forgotten chapter \nin the history of biology, in the study of \u201cmental\u201d function it remains a success story, even \nlong after the days of behaviorism have passed. A long sequence of externalist views of \nmeaning suggests that meaning is a matter of external function and causal relations: meaning, \nit is thought, just cannot predate its use in referring. It is bootstrapped from reference, consists \nin the latter. Why this methodological dualism with respect to the two domains, the \u201cmental\u201d \nand the \u201cphysical\u201d? On a unified view, if the environment cannot cause organic adaptive \nstructures to come into existence, it cannot bring concepts into existence. Indeed, for the rest \nof this paper, I will suppose that \u201cmental\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d will be no more than informal labels \npicking out empirically different domains for theoretical inquiry, with no implications for \neither ontology or method. \n  \n2. The Darwin-Spencer Divide \n \nThe assessment above regarding Darwin and Spencer may seem surprising in the light of \nDennett (1995) calling Spencer \u201can important clarifier of some of Darwin\u2019s best ideas\u201d (p. \n393). These ideas, for Dennett, appear to be Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution as such, for what he \ncriticizes in Spencer\u2019s account are their social-Darwinist applications. \u201cSpencer was a \nDarwinian \u2013 or you could say that Charles Darwin was a Spencerian\u201d, we read, and also: \u201cthe \nmodern synthesis is Spencerian to its core\u201d (ibid., 394). As a self-confessed \u201cgood Spencerian \nadaptationist\u201d, Dennett adopts Godfrey-Smith\u2019s \u201cEnvironmental Complexity Thesis\u201d (ECT), \naccording to which \u201cthere is complexity in the organism in virtue of complexity in the \nenvironment\u201d (ibid., 395; see Godfrey-Smith 1998).  \nSpencer presumably defended a strong version of this paradigmatically externalist \nclaim, to the effect that environmental complexity is both necessary and sufficient for organic \ncomplexity. Godfrey-Smith opts for its mere necessity \u2013 a claim I have already said I will \ndeny \u2013 and proposes, more precisely, to understand the ECT as a thesis about the function of \ncognition and its evolutionary rationale, in the teleonomic sense of function: cognition \nevolved for the sake of enabling the agent to deal with environmental complexity. While that \nappears as an answer to a \u201cwhy\u201d-question \u2013 it aims to explain why cognition exists in the first \nplace, by appeal to a notion of what it is \u201cfor\u201d \u2013 the thesis can also be read as an \nempirical\/explanatory claim (which it was in Spencer\u2019s version of it): structural complexity \noutside causes\/explains structural complexity inside.  \nNote that thus understood, human language, to which I will repeatedly return, would \nseem a particularly unpromising start for the ECT. If the ECT had its way, externalist \nstructures in the environment should predict or at least stand in some systematic relation to \nthe core structural properties we can empirically attest in the workings of the computational \nsystem underlying human language. To my knowledge, little evidence suggests this, as long \nas one accepts standard textbook accounts of that system (see e.g. Culicover 1997, and see \nsections 4 and 7).3 At the same time, the case in question shows that more than the mere \n                                                 \n3 Language is created by children in the absence of a \u201clanguage model\u201d, or linguistic structure in the \nenvironment. See Goldin-Meadow (2003), and Yang (2002) for a state of the art account of language acquisition. \nNone of the points in the text is to say that the ECT does not have a reading under which it is \u201cobviously true\u201d, \nas Neander (1997: 567-8) claims, who considers it as \u201ctrivial\u201d as the claim that \u201ccirculation is for transporting \n 4\nnecessity of environmental complexity for the origin of the internal structures would have to \nbe invoked in defending an externalism as underlying the ECT, since otherwise even the \nstrongest internalist, such as Chomsky (2000), need not disagree: there surely are various \nphysical and environmental preconditions that are necessary for the language faculty to \nevolve phylogenetically and mature ontogenetically. \nIrrespective of the particular case of human language, Godfrey-Smith agrees that the \n\u201ccritical feature of a Darwinian mechanism is that the variants produced do not bear a \nsystematic relation to the environmental factors that exert selective pressure on the organism\u201d \n(Godfrey-Smith 1998: 87). Looking at the matter with Darwinian eyes, indeed, at least the \norigins of organic complexity have not much to do with what the latter is \u201cfor\u201d. For Darwin \nbut not Spencer, the environment is silent on matters of design. It does not act on the \norganism so as to mold it and confer structural complexity to it, or so as to create adaptations. \nDarwinian environmental selection is like a spectator sport: choosing among forms that \npresent themselves, as a consequence of which these forms get redistributed in following \ngenerations. The evolutionary process works with forms that are already there, and have an \ninternal cause in random (undirected) mutations: they occur with no preferred orientation in \nadaptive directions. Natural selection itself is \u201cblind\u201d in a similar way: it does not see into the \nadaptive future.4  \nIn short, nothing is there because of what leads it to be selected, or because of what it \nis useful for (even though much is not any more there because of what it was not useful for).5 \nAt least in this sense, then, there is, for the Darwinian, no direct transfer or induction of \nstructure, a direct causal or explanatory path from environmental complexity to internal \nstructure. By crediting the environment with a more \u201cactive\u201d role in structuring the organism, \nSpencer falls on the Lamarckian side in the Darwin-Lamarck-divide, with direct \n                                                                                                                                                        \nblood around the body\u201d. Even such \u201ctrivialities\u201d regarding the externalist\u2019s notion of what something is \u201cfor\u201d \nmay be unavailable for human language, though. All species communicate, but the specific way in which we do \ndoes not seem to explain specific linguistic structures. Possibly, mechanisms allowing language processing \nevolved irrespective of their later use in the human communication system (Hauser et al. 2002, Fitch and Hauser \n2004). It remains unclear today what theoretical and practical purpose some identification of the \u201cfunction of \nlanguage\u201d serves (see further Chomsky 2003b: 312-3). For a doubt on the coherence of the externalism entailed \nby the ECT see also Sterelny (1997). \n4 On the so-called \u201cstatistical\u201d interpretation of evolutionary theory (Walsh et al. 2002), moreover, it is a theory \nabout the structure of populations only, not a theory of \u201cforces\u201d acting on individual organisms (and hence not a \ntheory about any \u201ccreative\u201d forces, see the next fn.). Not applying to individual-level phenomena, natural \nselection does not offer explanations of them. \n5 The view I am endorsing in this paragraph is not particularly controversial, if indeed \u201cno version of Darwinism \nholds that natural selection explains how, against a given genetic background, a particular mutation which \nconfers an advantage arises\u201d (Godfrey-Smith 1998: 93). Still, there is of course an ongoing debate on whether \nnatural selection has a creative role to play on the evolutionary scene. Thus, Neander (1995) argues that \u201cnatural \nselection has a creative and not merely distributive role to play\u201d (ibid., p. 586), whereas, on the view above, the \ncreative role is played by random mutations on the individual level alone. The \u201cstatistical\u201d as opposed to the \n\u201cdynamic\u201d interpretation of evolutionary theory (fn. 6), supports the present view. Neander crucially appeals to \nthe cumulativity of the adaptive process, in which some earlier preservations and proliferations of some co-\nadapted sequence of genes changes the probability of what subsequent variations will arise. Still, natural \nselection cannot but influence what subsequent variations will \u201crandomly arise\u201d (Neander 1995: 586; my \nemphasis), no matter whether they occur with other probabilities on the population level, given a changed gene \npool in which previous mutations took place. Neander\u2019s argument, one might say, depends on mixing two \n\u201ccycles of causation\u201d. In a single-step selection process, as she points out, there is a \u201ccausal isolation\u201d between \neach random\/select sequence. Here the causal processes invoked are the organism-internal ones giving rise to a \nrandom mutation. In cumulative selection, she further argues, one random\/select sequence is not causally \nisolated from the next. But, now, the notion of \u201ccausality\u201d has widened and invokes the gene pool in which \ncertain distributional shifts have taken place.   \nThat said, the whole issue about cumulativity is possibly orthogonal to the concerns of this paper. What \nexplanatory role, if any, natural selection needs to play for the origins of human language is a widely open \nquestion (cf. Hauser et al. 2002); and as regards human concepts, if these are atoms in the sense of Fodor (1998), \nhence primitives, it is not clear how they should have arisen gradually by cumulative selection. \n 5\nrepercussions for his paradigmatically associationist psychology. Thus, Spencer took it for a \nlaw that  \n\u201call psychical relations whatever, from the absolutely indissoluble to the fortuitous, are \nproduced by experiences of the corresponding external relations; and are so brought \ninto harmony with them\u201d (Spencer 1855: 530).  \nAs Godfrey-Smith puts this view: \u201cthe environment brings about an organic change exactly in \nits own image\u201d (1998: 86), a mechanism meant to account both for within-generation and \nacross-generations change. Since variation is acquired for Spencer, by the direct causal flow \nof environment to organism, for the sake of an increasing optimization in the latter, there is a \ndiminished importance for the process of selection, as what is there to be selected is already \nbrought in harmony with environmental pressures.  \nSpencer remained essentially uncompromising in his \u201cLamarckian\u201d psychology \nthroughout his life, despite certain concessions on the possibility of trial-and-error-learning in \naddition to classical conditioning (see Godfrey-Smith 1998: 88-92). Only the former form of \nlearning can be termed \u201cDarwinian\u201d, in that new variants are produced randomly or \nspontaneously. Spencer\u2019s hyper-externalism radicalizes Lamarckism, in fact, in that the \nLamarckian organism\u2019s \u201ccreative response to felt needs\u201d \u2013 as when the giraffe stretches for a \nlonger and longer neck to reach up to the treetops \u2013 is now itself thought to be molded by the \nenvironment. Lamarck by contrast crucially appealed, internalistically, to drives towards \nadaptive complexity (\u201cinherent tendencies\u201d, \u201cinnate proclivities\u201d) as well. But these must \ncome from somewhere, Spencer (and Dennett 1995) would object here, and the environment \nis meant to turn that trick, too. \nThere is a caricature of Lamarck, according to which, as Gould puts it, \u201ca giraffe felt a \nneed for a long neck, stretched ever so hard, and then passed the results of these successful \nefforts directly to its offspring\u201d (Gould 2002: 179). An analogy to this caricature in \npsychology would be this: a human, feeling the need to name a certain \u2013 given, yet nameless \n\u2013 kind by a concept, thought ever so hard, came up with a suitable concept, and passed it on. \nThe Darwinian response to that caricature would be that no need for a new concept will as \nsuch bring it into existence.  \nWhile Lamarckism in biology is nowadays regarded as factually wrong, if not \nnecessarily (Dawkins 1983), its analogy in psychology is much alive: in particular, if \nontogenetic learning is conceived as an \u201cinstructive\u201d rather than a \u201cselective\u201d process, it is the \nsort of direct flow of structure or information from the environment to the organism that \nDarwin denied.6 The classical case would be Skinner\u2019s (1969) theory of learning as an \naccumulation of learned habits or operants. Dawkins (1983: 20-23) however argues that \nlearning, if understood as adaptive improvement, must in principle be supported by and \ndepend on an independent Darwinian selective mechanism as well. Structure in the organism \nmay be induced, but none of these changes are intrinsically adaptive. As long as explaining \nprogressive evolution is our goal, Dawkins\u2019 argument shows it is not coherent to merely add a \nDarwinian mechanism of evolution to an independently operative Lamarckian one. \nIn fact, Lamarckian instructive views of learning create a basic and unresolved \nparadox: it seems inconceivable that a human could \u201cstretch for a concept it lacks\u201d. The \n                                                 \n6 As pointed out by Jerne (1967) (see also Piattelli Palmarini 1989 and Gazzaniga 1992), the history of biology \nprovides many examples for a move from instructive models to selective models of some particular \nphenomenon. In the concrete case of the immune system that Jerne was primarily concerned with, it had been \nargued that, in the light of the immense numbers of antigens that existed in the environment, an organism could \nnot possibly hold a stock of antibodies perfectly \u201cadapted\u201d to them. Still, it is now thought that an animal  \n\u201ccannot be stimulated to make specific antibodies, unless it has already made antibodies of this \nspecificity before the antigen arrives.\u201d (Jerne 1967: 201). \nWhat is relevant here is Jerne\u2019s point that a given environmental problem as such does not tell us about its \npossible solutions. Indeed nothing is a problem, \u201cobjectively\u201d, unless the organism has the conceptual resources \nto deal with it or grasp it as such, or has a conception of its possible solutions (cf. Piattelli Palmarini 1989: 13).  \n 6\nproblem in its Ancient Socratean formulation, is not one about species-specific restrictions on \nwhat concepts each individual can possess (or how a monkey should come up with the \nconcept of an integer, if by its nature it is incapable of that concept). The problem, as Jerne \n(1967) saw it, is that if you do not know what you are looking for, lacking the relevant \nconcept, you can neither look for it nor find it. To look for it, you have to know what you are \nlooking for, which by hypothesis you don\u2019t, lacking the relevant concept. You also cannot \nfind it, for lacking the relevant concept you would not recognize that it was the solution to \nyour problem.  \nIn the reformulation of this classical problem by Fodor, it runs as follows. Suppose \nyou wish to acquire a concept you lack, say the concept expressed by the word \u201cred\u201d, \npresumably a primitive concept.7 Suppose, too, that learning it would require an inductive \nprocess of hypothesis-formation and testing. If that is the case, you have, at some stage, to \nform the hypothesis that some object falls under the concept expressed by \u201cred\u201d by virtue of \nbeing red. But that is not possible, because by assumption you lack the concept involved in \nthis hypothesis (cf. Fodor 1998: 124). In another formulation, you can only learn what you \ncan represent with given conceptual resources, but not what requires more powerful \nstructures than those in place.  \nThe internalist response to the paradox is that \u201clearning concepts\u201d is strictly speaking a \nmisnomer and a child\u2019s learning certain concepts at certain times in ontogenetic development \nwill be no more than a mapping given phonetic labels to given representational resources that \nare in place at those developmental stages, resources that themselves originate on independent \nand internal grounds. E.g., on Yang\u2019s (2002) model, learning grammars consists in discarding \nthose grammars not matching environmental data (a form of \u201clearning by forgetting\u201d, see \nMehler and Dupoux 1994). Similarly, it may be that concepts are basically in place and usable \nif triggered in relevant critical periods, though discarded if not selected by an environment.8 \nThe externalist and Spencerian response is also that the concepts are already there, but now \nthey are supposed to be there in the environment; learning is the transfer of this structure to \nthe organism.  I return to learning and its paradox in sections 5 and 6.  \nSpencer, discarding the need for any internalist creative and non-functionally driven \nelement in mental development, committed himself to show that the \u201cmind, supposed passive, \nis moulded by its experiences of \u2018outer relations\u2019\u201d (James 1880: 188), arguing that \nintelligence developed out of cumulative modifications through the direct influence of the \nenvironment: \n\u201cThe cohesion between psychical states is proportionate to the frequency with which \nthe relation between the answering external phenomena has been repeated in \nexperience.\u201d (Spencer 1855, cited by James 1880: 184) \nThat is, what we know is a function of what happened to us (or our ancestors). James objected \nto what he argued was \u201can obsolete anachronism, reverting to a pre-darwinian type of \nthought\u201d. Instead, \n\u201cnew conceptions, emotions, and active tendencies which evolve are originally \nproduced in the shape of random images, fancies, accidental out-births of spontaneous \nvariation in the functional activity of the excessively instable human brain, which the \n                                                 \n7 That is, a concept not decomposable into others on the basis of which it could be learned on a piece-by-piece \nbasis together with a known mechanism of combination (such as syntax, or logic). Atomism for conceptual \nprimitives will be assumed in what follows, a commitment any decompositionalist has to shoulder too, though \nshe would assume a lesser number of primitives. See Fodor (1998), and also (Carey 1982: 47) for empirical and \nconceptual evidence against lexical decomposition. \n8 For some striking recent experimental evidence see Hespos and Spelke (2004); see also Carey (2004) for how \ngiven representational resources for numerical representation may remain unused. Carey offers a \n\u201cbootstrapping\u201d mechanism for avoiding the problem that we cannot learn what we cannot represent; she does \nnot, however, show that, ever in the ontogeny of the human integer concept, a stronger representational resource \nis generated from a strictly weaker one. \n 7\nouter environment simply confirms or refutes, adopts or rejects, preserves or destroys, \n- selects, in short (\u2026).\u201d (James 1880: 184) \nThat picture is true, James sensibly concedes, for the \u201chigher mental departments\u201d only, as the \nlower ones are clearly not creative (or stimulus-insensitive, or non-input driven) in the sense \nJames emphasizes: while there is (some) sense in which I am under the direct influence of the \nenvironment when I feel pain, say, there is no external or internal physical fact or \nconfiguration that, as far as we can tell, will force me to say or think anything in particular. \nOn James\u2019 \u201cDarwinian\u201d alternative to Spencer, then, an environment selects a concept \nfor a use, but it does not create it, or shape the organism so as to let it have a concept where it \nlacked one before. There is evidently no denial of adaptation here, but there is a standard \nDarwinian denial that adaptation is a causal mechanism for the emergence of novel internal \nstructure in the organism. Adaptedness is the long-term effect or result \u2013 indeed the necessary \nresult \u2013 of environmental selection, but not a cause for it, as Spencer held. I will pursue this \nJamesian internalist vision of concept possession for the rest of the paper, elaborating first on \nthe meaning of \u201cconcept\u201d as a theoretical term. \n3. Concepts \nOn the Jamesian-Darwinian picture, the relation of content holding between an expression \n(e.g. word) and an object depends on (i) internally given structures the organism finds itself \nhaving, and (ii) an environment selecting among these structures, with the result of adaptively \ncomplex structures in the long term. The environment does not \u201cproduce\u201d the internal \nstructures (concepts); while intentional relations (what our thought and talk ends up being \nabout) does depend on history and environmental causation, this needs to tell us nothing about \nthe origin of concepts that figure in them. While this is unintuitive, it may be no more so than \nthat the height of treetops and the need for high feeding should not cause giraffes to have long \nnecks.  \nConcepts, in my technical usage, then, will be internal structures in organisms that \nenable these organisms to take up certain functions. In the human case, they will play a role in \nreferential acts, while not having reference intrinsically, which would be like saying that \norganic structures are intrinsically adaptive. This is not to say that concepts in the present \nsense are non-semantic, though, a point to which I will return. It is not the case, in particular, \nthat just any of these internal structures could take up any referential function. A concept \nsuited to refer to a person, for example, cannot be used to refer to a tree (as such). The \nstandard externalist explanation for this fact would be that persons are not trees, and that this \nfactual property of persons enters into our concept of persons, which we then, and because of \nwhat properties it is caused by, do not apply to trees. But here the internalist replies that the \nresponse is as plausible as the view that some creature, by being exposed to an environment to \nwhich it stands in causal relations, acquires some specific concept of it. Nothing in biology \nsuggests that we acquire internal complexity by standing in causal relations, unless we have \nsuitable internal structures for that to happen. There is no more reason for an Alien to acquire \nconcepts of heat, houses or justice, when placed in an earth-bound environment, than there is \nfor a rat to acquire concepts of beauty, pianos, or mental states.  \nConcepts as here understood do not determine reference, nor do they originate from \nreference (i.e., functionally), though they enable a human to take up referential relations in a \nspecies-specific way, given a suitable environment. \u201cConcept\u201d is a functional notion in the \nintuitive sense that it enters into the explanation of the organism\u2019s functioning. But that does \nnot mean a concept is picked out relationally by appeal to what it is used for. Amundson and \nLauder (1994: 234-5) argue that identifying the function of an organismic form or structural \npattern does not, in the factual practice of evolutionary biology, depend on figuring out \npurposes or selected effects, and in fact not on any reference to the environment. Again, the \n\u201cfunction\u201d of the form may be what it is not used for, and never was: ecological experiments \nmay have to be set up to elicit its possible functions, or how it can be used. If so, its \n 8\necological function does not precede the structure and is no presupposition for our \nunderstanding of it. Concepts in the present sense cannot then be picked out by their actual \nuse or content for the same reasons that organismic structures cannot necessarily be picked \nout or understood in terms of their actual use. They could be picked out by their possible \ncontent, or their semantic potential, but they are not explained by these latter notions either. \nIn so viewing concepts I am departing from standard philosophical usage, where a \nconcept is usually either (i) the intentional content of a mental representation structure, or (ii) \na symbolic mental representation in the brain that intrinsically has such a content. In the first \ncase, a concept is an intension (abstract object) or extension, in the second it is a syntactic \nobject intrinsically relating to some external object or set-theoretic construct that it is \u201ctrue \nof\u201d.9 Concepts in the present sense have neither property. There is a connection between \nconcepts in my sense and worldly extensions, in that the former are adaptive structures (they \nenable humans to make sense of the world). But they need not be caused by anything out \nthere, and the connections in which they stand to external objects that exist and have causal \nproperties are not intrinsic ones. In particular, even when functional, they do not necessarily \ntrack properties of the external world, as when we describe material things of the everyday \nworld as solid and impenetrable, but physics tells us that these things consist of atoms that are \nmostly empty space. We still interpret the world in terms of categories like fire, earth, air and \nwater, which are the Ancients\u2019 four elements, even though only the last has turned out to \ndenote a natural kind, and we know this. In the case of ordinary concepts like mind, fate, \nbelief, gratitude, Chinese, the heavens, perfection, war, London, or city, we have essentially \nno idea how to pin down what the referents of these concepts out there are, and certainly it \nseems we cannot do so in a non-circular fashion, i.e. without re-using the concepts in \nquestion.10 I will henceforth denote concepts in the two standard senses above by means of \nthe familiar CAPITALS, and use the word \u201cconcept\u201d uncapitalized if I intend my own notion. \nOf course, none of the internalism above entails that how a given concept actually \nfunctions with respect to an environment can be determined empirically without looking at \nthat environment. The actual functioning in the relational sense of \u201cfunction\u201d is nothing that is \ndetermined \u201cin the head\u201d, but this is trivially so, not substantively. What environment an \norganism is embedded in is not determinable by looking at internal structures in the organism, \njust as a Euro-detecting vending machine built in Germany does not as such determine \nwhether it will detect German, Dutch, Italian, or Greek Euros. This will depend on its history, \nor where the machine is placed and how it is used. This kind of \u201cexternalism\u201d, a truism, does \nnothing to imply the kind of \u201cSpencerian\u201d causal flow from the environment to the organism \nthat I dispute.11  \n                                                 \n9 Note that in the case of the child\u2019s putative concept of a possible language (on this see further section 7 below) \nthere literally is nothing in the environment for that concept to be \u201ctrue of\u201d or to \u201capply to\u201d: the structural \npatterns that this concept characterizes \u2013 phonetic, phonological and semantic mental representations, including \nthe primes and relations making up these representations \u2013 are nowhere visible in the acoustic patterns that \ndescribe the outward physical side of language. It is widely argued, in particular, that the most basic syntactic \ncategories \u2013 Noun and Verb \u2013 have neither a phonetic, nor a cognitive, nor a semantic or pragmatic rationale \n(Baker 2003 defines them in purely syntactic terms). Carstairs-McCarthy (1999; cf. 90, 161) provides an \ninternalist, phonetic rationale for them.  \n10 With respect to London, one might have hoped that it is clear what the referent is: a geographical place. But \nthis tells us virtually nothing about how we use that word in referring to things. As Chomsky (2000) points out, \nLondon isn\u2019t a place, for cities can be destroyed and rebuild at another spot, while remaining the same; \nmoreover, cities are cultural and moral entities as well, viewed with or without their history; they are \nenvironments, as when we say they are polluted; and they can be all these things at the same time, as in the \nsentence London is so old, corrupt, and polluted that we should destroy and rebuilt it 100 miles away (see \nfurther Chomsky 2000, and Hinzen forthcoming).  \n11 The Kripke and Putnam cases for an externalist view of content have equally no force against the present \ninternalist view. Intentional relations depend on environmental causation (in the sense of selection), but they do \nnot explain the concepts that figure in these intentional relations. The Twin-Earth story tells us something about \n 9\nWhat brings it about that an organism with particular internal structures takes up \nintentional relations? This happens as a necessary consequence of embedding the organism in \nan environment to which its internal structures are suited in some ways rather than others, and \nbetter or worse so than other such structures. Intentionality does not explain the embedding of \nan organism in an environment and how it functions within it, for it is simply the embedding \nitself that will have various (and more or less successful) intentional relations as a result. \nThese relations are enabled but not caused by the organism\u2019s internal structures, and certainly \nthey do not cause these internal structures. To say that they do, in the above analogy, would \nbe like saying that our external use of the Euro-detector causes its internal mechanisms to \nexist, rather than depending on them.  \nWe may say, if we like, of our vending machine, that it has an internal structure (a \nconcept) referring to Euros. But what exactly is this referent? As noted, the vending machine \nwill have another \u201creferent\u201d in each country of the monetary union. We might save a \ntheoretically interesting notion of reference by forming an equivalence class of objects in the \nextension of the internal structure, but this extension will contain not only different kinds of \nEuros, but a lot of other things than money (intelligently designed toy-Euros, say). There can \nbe no objection to using such equivalence classes as the \u201csemantic values\u201d for internal \nconcepts, but it seems clear that the resulting view of meaning will still be an internalist one, \nsince it will be the internals of the machine or organism that will restrict and explain \nmembership in the extension. We answer the question of which things are in that extension \nsimply by noting which things do trigger the internal mechanism. A reference to the \nmechanism is crucial in delimiting the extension; hence the latter does not explain the former. \nMoving from vending machines to human infants, the story doesn\u2019t change. Thus, we find out \nwhich range of possible languages the child\u2019s innate knowledge of Universal Grammar (UG) \npermits, by looking at which languages factually do trigger the learning mechanism powered \nby UG (see further sections 4 and 7).  \nExternal uptake of function and reference is thus, at the same time, an arbitrary and a \nnon-arbitrary matter. Arbitrary, because the internal structure as such cannot determine the \nrange of things to which it will actually be applied or with respect to which it will be used \nduring its history; non-arbitrary, because the nature of the organism\u2019s internal make-up will \nallow certain uses, while forbidding others. Again, to understand this restriction, we cannot \nlook at the world. The world is not responsible for what concepts can mean (how they can be \nused); rather it is (partially) responsible for what they end up meaning (how they are factually \nused).  \n4. Semantics from teleology \nSuppose that intentional relations to the world reduce to (i) structures in the organism, \nsyntactically individuated, (ii) external entities, and (iii) causal relations between (i) and (ii). \nCall this the causal-externalist view of meaning. Concepts in the present sense, hence viewed \nas internal to the organism and as enabling it to take up certain referential acts rather than \nothers, are not a part of this picture. In the absence of concepts-in-the-head playing this role, it \nmust be symbols and their relations to the world alone that bootstrap meaning, are necessary \nand sufficient for it. Clearly, however, many things in the world, over and above the referent \nas such, may cause the occurrence of a mental representation having that referent as its \ncontent. Even though, for example, cow-skins are necessarily co-instantiated with cows \n                                                                                                                                                        \nthe possible uses of our concepts, nothing about why they exist. When being transferred to Twin-Earth without \nrealizing it, our concepts will end up being used to refer to (what is, in one sense of the term \u201cwater\u201d) non-water. \nThat is as interesting as history gets. Equally, Kripke\u2019s argument that G\u00f6del remains G\u00f6del even if we discover \nthat he did not discover the Incompleteness Theorems, receives an internalist answer: it gives us an indirect \npiece of evidence about the nature of our concept of a person. The insight is that persons for us are not \nindividuated by their scientific achievements. This does not explain why that is the concept it is (see further \nHinzen forthcoming, a). \n 10\nwhenever they occur, humans of course distinguish the concepts of a cow and of a cow-skin. \nIf human meaning is to remain a matter of causal and functional relations, one has to sieve out \nsomehow those relations that do not intuitively constitute the meaning of a mental \nrepresentation. The notion of a proper function has been thought to accomplish just this: the \nfunctions that are thought to explain and properly individuate meaning must be biological \nfunctions that the organism has been selected for.  \nSpecifically, then, our concept of a cow means cow rather than horse or donkey \nbecause indicating the vicinity of any of the latter is not its proper function: it is selected for \nbeing produced in the presence of all and only cows; in this case and this case only it \nfunctions in accordance with its purpose and design. But again we may notice that what is \nselected in a Darwinian context is a functional relationship that depends on concepts in the \npresent sense being there, rather than causing these concepts. In the absence of the relevant \nconcept in the organism, the presence of cows alone will not necessarily produce it; and if it \ndoes trigger it in a particular human at a particular time, we cannot predict or explain this \nfrom an independent or objective identification of the external stimulus, because we only \nknow which stimulus we are talking about from the response itself that makes use of a certain \nconcept: we might have responded by thinking \u201ccow-skin\u201d, and then we would have \nconcluded that the stimulus supposedly controlling or producing this response was the skin \n(cf. Chomsky 1959). Most human concepts do not seem to be associated with particular \nadaptive functions in a way that they could be understood as reflexive response-mechanisms \nto independently given and identified environmental variables that cause or control them.12  \nIn the possibly more hopeful case of non-human concepts, say a frog\u2019s neural \nrepresentation of a fly, again many things will trigger the same response mechanism mediated \nby this representation, not just flies (inedible fly-imitations will do). But we may now take the \nwider ecological context into account and then point to what made the frog and its ancestors \nflourish as opposed to what did not, thereby finding reasons to distinguish among stimuli \ntriggering what is in one clear sense the same response. Still, from this very conclusion we \nsee that if we limit our attention to the internal structures of the organism and the frog brain\u2019s \nrepresentational powers, exactly the same mental representations or concepts are involved in \nresponding to the flies and the fly-imitations (just as the internal mechanism of the Euro-\ndetecting machine does not become different when it, through some historical accident, \ncomes to detect toy-Euros). No matter what wider ecological context and history we include \nin our picture of the frog, it won\u2019t distinguish between different concepts in two such cases, \nand not explain the origin of the concept (in the present sense) that is involved. It does \ndistinguish, though, quite trivially, among the different (human) CONCEPTS associated with \nthese concepts. Which CONCEPTS a given concept comes to support depends of course on \nhistory, also on the present account.  \nGenerally speaking, we may regard adaptive functioning as setting a problem for \nbiological explanation, rather than providing a solution. At times, describing adaptive \nfunctions may already be part of the answer: these are adaptationist explanations, which \nwould then not only explain why some internal mechanisms is selected, but why it comes to \nexist in the first place. But their range of applicability is an empirical question and should not \nbe rated as having the status of a default assumption, particularly not if we regard adaptation \u2013 \nwith Amundson and Lauder (1994: 254), or G. C. Williams \u2013 as an \u201conerous\u201d concept, appeal \n                                                 \n12 As Hauser et al. remark, \u201c[U]nlike the best animal examples of putatively referential signals [such as vervet \nmonkey alarm calls, W.H.], most of the words of human language are not associated with specific functions (e.g. \nwarning cries, food announcements) but can be linked to virtually any concept that humans can entertain. Such \nusages are often intricate and detached from the here and now. Even for the simplest words, there is typically no \nstraightforward word-thing relationship, if \u2018thing\u2019 is to be understood in mind-independent terms.\u201d (Hauser et al. \n2002: 1576) Cf. also fn. 15 above: it seems impossible to individuate e.g. a city in \u201cobjective\u201d terms, i.e. in ways \nthat do not depend on our concept of a city.     \n 11\nto which is a kind of last resort. That aside, it is not clear how these explanations would work \nin the case at hand, the case of concepts, given that the frog\u2019s fly concept is precisely the \nsame, no matter whether it has adaptive or maladaptive consequences (reacts to flies proper, \nor to fly-imitations whose digestion kills the frog).  \nPapineau (2001) asks more generally what teleosemantics adds to our understanding \nof the nature of contentful states, and answers: \u201cit tells us about the underlying nature of \ncognitive design, and thereby directs us to the past selectionist processes which fixed the real \npurposes of our cognitive parts\u201d (p. 288). But as I want to argue in the rest of this section, \nthere is no general reason why being so directed should help to understand the nature of \ncognitive design, or reveal anything about its \u201cunderlying nature\u201d. It is an open and entirely \nempirical question what explanatory role natural selection, if any, has played in the \nemergence of human cognition and design.  \nTo illustrate this with our human knowledge of language, no one doubts that this \nparticular competence evolved. Neither does anyone doubt that it \u201cevolved by natural \nselection\u201d, if this option leaves open, as it should, which evolutionary factors precisely have \ncarried which explanatory weights in its evolutionary origins. Human language function is \nhere again part of a problem for biological explanation, and a part of the current answer is \nUniversal Grammar (UG). We may view UG as a structural type characterizing core \nknowledge of language present in humans and underlying their use of particular languages, all \nof which are variants of this type. We should note that speculations on evolutionary history \nhave factually played no role in unearthing the generative principles characterizing UG. An \nadaptive rationale for UG has been stipulated long after it existed (Pinker 1994), and not \nindeed because the specific structures of UG posited on empirical grounds would empirically \nsuggest an adaptive rationale (which indeed they do not, by and large; see Uriagereka 1998 \nand Carstairs-McCarthy 1999 for discussion).  \nUG as viewed in the biolinguistic tradition (Jenkins 2000, Anderson and Lightfoot \n2002) may thus rather be viewed as similar in nature to the \u201cunities of type\u201d of the rational \nmorphologists of pre-Darwinian times, where they were taken to constrain the evolutionary \nprocess as independently explanatory generative principles, rather than being the results of it \n(on this interpretation of UG see further, Hinzen, forthcoming). By explaining commonalities \nof structure across widely divergent functionalities by appeal to a common ancestor of the \nseveral species that a given type was meant to unify, Darwin effectively subordinated the \nrational morphologists\u2019 explanatory principle \u2013 the \u201cunity of type\u201d \u2013 to the functionalist\u2019s \u2013 \nthe \u201cconditions of existence\u201d. Still, Darwin found the unities of types well in place before \ndeclaring them common ancestors; and declaring them common ancestors will no doubt not \nexplain these (Amundson 1998). More generally, there appears to be little reason to believe \nthat the basic theoretical concept of the formalists, the concept of homology, only makes \nsense in the light of the crucial theoretical concept of the functionalists, the concept of \nadaptation.13  \nBy the same token, there is no reason, as of now, to follow the teleosemanticist\u2019s \nadvice, as presented by Papineau, and to presumptively look for \u201cselectionist processes\u201d as \nsomething that \u201cfixed the real purposes of our cognitive parts\u201d. We would be begging \ninteresting empirical questions on what our design and its origin and rationale really are.  \n \n5. Spencerian semantics at work \nDretske (1988) develops the conflation of function and genesis into a whole explanatory \nframework. He centrally defends the claim that what our words or mental representations \nmean is a function of how they came to be, namely through \u201clearning\u201d. His theoretical goal is \n                                                 \n13 See again Amundson and Lauder (1994: 243) against the hegemony of functional explanations; and see \nAmundson (1998) and Gilbert et al. (1996) on the return of the \u201cunity of type\u201d, a movement that has continued \nsince. \n 12\n\u201cto install the informational processes underlying concept learning as the source of meaning \nand content\u201d (Dretske 1994: 260), a goal that in turn subserves another, to show the \nintentional contents of the mind to be causally relevant in the explanation of behavior. \nConcepts, according to Dretske, flow naturally (without the mediation of intentional \npropositional attitudes) from our encounters with external environments. Behavior is strictly  \nconditioned. It is not even a Lamarckian \u201ccreative\u201d response to recurring situations, and even \nmore clearly not a Darwinian selection of an independently originating internal structure.   \nThat the acquisition of a concept could not depend on anything other than learning, \nhence could not have an internal cause, is inconceivable for Dretske, as only its having an \nexternal cause in the sense of being appropriately conditioned, makes it acquire causal \nrelevance in the explanation of behaviour:  \n\u201c(...) the content of beliefs and desires, of fears and intentions, the representational \ncontent that is featured in every explanation of behaviour by reasons, must derive from \nthe development in learning of those circuits that constrain and structure voluntary \naction.\u201c (Dretske 1994: 262) \nTo get intentional contents with causal relevance, one must \u201clook to systems whose control \nstructures are actually shaped by the kind of dependency relations that exist between internal \nand external conditions\u201d (Dretske 1988: 95, my emphasis). Meaning is causally relevant to \nbehaviour only in situations in which it is \u201cassociatively learned\u201d (ibid., 96), by way of a \n\u201cmechanical\u201d response (ibid., 85): \n\u201cBy the timely reinforcement of certain output \u2013 by rewarding this output when, and \ngenerally only when, it occurs in certain conditions \u2013 internal indicators of these \nconditions are recruited as causes of this output.\u201d (ibid., 98) \nBut in a Darwinian frame of mind, Dretske\u2019s insistance that internal structures subserving \nintentional behavior \u201cmust\u201d derive from learning is the fallacy of conflating genesis and \nfunction: Darwin showed us how even the most perfect adaptedness of an organism to an \nenvironment does not require us to invoke Lamarckian shaping or environmental instruction. \nThere is no inherent relation between adaptation and genesis, function and causal history, how \nsomething works and how it came to be. And of course there are standard empirical \nobjections to Dretske\u2019s need for learning, too: children know more than they can have learned \nfrom the kinds and amounts of inputs they receive, and what they know does not necessarily \nreflect what they hear (for a review of poverty of the stimulus arguments see Mehler and \nDupoux 1994, Yang 2002, Anderson and Lightfoot 2002; for doubts about the significance of \n\u201cassociative learning\u201d at large see also Gallistel and Gibbon 2001).  \nThe notion of \u201cdevelopment in learning\u201d as such, informally understood, may in \nprinciple involve any amount of creativity on the side of the organism. But this is clearly not \nallowed in the technical notion of learning employed by Dretske. The internal control \nstructures that are acquired are supposed to crucially not depend on the organism\u2019s active \ncontribution and the internal resources it brings to bear on understanding, but instead on what \nthey do mean or indicate about the external circumstances to which the organism\u2019s behavior \nis appropriated during learning (cf. Dretske 1988: 88). As Dretske (1994: 260) points out, \n\u201c[W]hat converts a physical state \u2013 some condition of the brain \u2013 into a belief is outside the \nhead\u201d. This latter assertion has a reading on which it is trivially true, for the embedding of an \norganism and its concomitant functioning in the environment in which it is placed is nothing \nthat the organism causes. But this is not the reading Dretske intends, where the conceptual \nstructures subserving intentionality are mechanically induced, as in empiricist learning \ntheories more generally. My point is again that it is an empirical question, when we look at \nparticular processes that we intuitively describe as \u201clearning\u201d, whether the process we look at \nis no more than the selection of a given neural structure, whatever its origin. Wherever this \nwould be arguably true, we could still say that: \n 13\ninstances of a mental representation, R, carry information about instances of an \nexternal property, P, if \u201cPs and only Ps cause Rs\u201d is a law, \nwhich is essentially how Fodor (1990: 57) summarizes Dretske\u2019s approach. But these co-\nvariance relations would then merely indicate a result of an evolutionary process of natural \nselection and variation. As a result of this two-step evolutionary process, we do have \nreference, but the concepts that enable the latter would have a different cause.  \n By and large, the behaviourist view of meaning as deriving from associative learning \nor conditioning is as clear an expression of Spencerism as one can get. Dennett (1995) \nendorses this heritage unabashed (both the Spencerism and the behaviourism). Even Fodor \n(1990) is fully explicit that he regards Dretske\u2019s as well as his own causal co-variance-\napproach to meaning as continuous with that of Skinner. Skinner\u2019s account of language \nacquisition reduces language learning to social reinforcements mediating alterations in the \nstrength of verbal operants: an operant response comes under the control of a type of \ndiscriminative stimulus as a function of the frequency with which the response elicits \nreinforcement when produced in the presence of stimuli of that type. While Chomsky\u2019s \ncritique of this view, Fodor argues, has effectively demolished his learning theory, it does \nnothing against the semantics that went with it. This seems immediately problematic for a \nview like Dretske\u2019s, where learning precisely is what grounds semantics, and the difference \nbetween a learning theory and a theory of meaning becomes moot. Fodor, by contrast, gives \nup on the learning theory, and focuses on what he calls a \u201cSkinnerian\u201d semantics, which he \nregards as independent of a learning theory. It is to this view that I now turn. \n \n6. Doing without learning \n \nOn Fodor\u2019s (1990) view, instances of the mental representation underlying the word dog \ndenote dogs because the former are under the causal control of instances of dogs in the \nenvironment. This is still a theory of meaning that bootstraps meaning from reference, or \nexplains the origin of concepts functionally, through causal relations. Fodor renounces \nbehaviourism, of course, but for a wrong reason, from the present point of view. The Fodorian \nreason is that his Skinnerian theory of how meaning comes about is reformulated as a theory \nof the semantics of thoughts (\u201cpropositional attitudes\u201d), the existence of which Skinner denied \n(Fodor 1990: 55). The advantage that Fodor claims for this reformulation is that while speech \nacts are actions, and it is plain that what we say is not a function of the situation we are placed \nin, what we think is no action in this sense. However, what I think in a situation seems no \nmore a function of what is true in it than what I say in it, not least because what can happen in \nit from my point of view is a function of what thoughts I, as opposed to a monkey, say, can \nthink. For a concern with Spencerism, what matters is not the view we take on the \nmetaphysics of propositional attitudes, but the view we take on semantics. What the \nDarwinian is opposed to is the idea that concepts \u2013 rather than functional relations to an \nenvironment as based on such concepts \u2013 are causally or mechanically generated by an \nenvironment or the things within it.  \nIf the dependency between concepts and their external function is as I have stated it, \nextensions cannot be constitutive for concepts, as they remain also in Fodor\u2019s later views. \nWhich extension is supposed to determine the content of a concept can only be identified by \nlooking at (understanding) the concept, hence is no cause of the concept. The present \nobjection to Fodor\u2019s account of concepts is thus that it provides a relational individuation of \nconcepts. In fact, Fodor\u2019s externalism is hard to square with his nativism. In Fodor (2001), \nFodor considers a theory according to which the relational properties of \u201cproto-concepts\u201d \n(innate concepts, considered prior to being externally triggered), relations that he supposes to \nbe constitutive for them, supervene on the proto-concepts\u2019 (possibly unactualized) \ndispositions to enter into causal world-to-mind relations: \u201cMaybe what makes a mental \n 14\nrepresentation a token of the proto-concept type CAT is its disposition to be triggered by cats\u201d \n(Fodor 2001: 137). But when precisely am I disposed to react to cats by saying or thinking \nsomething involving the concept of a cat? I am only so disposed if I have the concept of a cat, \nso that there is something to be triggered in the first place, and indeed some appropriate thing \n(the concept of a mouse would not do).14 Hence, however concepts are individuated, they \nmust be individuated independently of their dispositional relations to particular external \nobjects. \nWe face the same difficulty of combining a biological nativism with an externalist \nindividuation of content in Fodor\u2019s discussion of the learning paradox described in section 2. \nFodor\u2019s own (1998) response to the paradox is interestingly rather more in line with \nSpencer\u2019s than Plato\u2019s. Fodor starts by considering giving up on cognitivism, the view that \nconcept acquisition involves a process of hypothesis-formation and testing, and stipulating \ninstead that acquiring a concept is nomologically locking onto the property expressed by the \nconcept. Internal operations of the mind \u2013 forming beliefs, testing of hypotheses, concepts \u2013 \ndrop out of the process, and since these internal operations caused the problem in the first \nplace, the learning paradox disappears. This moves us into an externalist direction of \nexplanation, but the internalist response is predictable. Suppose indeed that having a concept \nis \u201cresonating to\u201d the property that the concept expresses. Then two questions arise: (i) what \nif not having the concept itself explains our resonating to the particular property expressed by \nit, rather than some other property (in which case the concept would not be explained by our \nresonating to the property)?; (ii) why the dualism of \u201cconcept\u201d, on the one hand, and \n\u201cproperty\u201d expressed by it, on the other (the latter being a metaphysical notion with possibly \nno naturalistic status at all)? The concept cannot be explained by its relation to the property, \nsince if we ask what property that is, we have to refer to the concept. \nWhile finding the above externalist and anti-cognitivist move attractive, however, \nFodor himself raises the problem that even locking on to a property does ultimately not seem \nto be a process that is unconditioned internally. It clearly seems to depend on exposures to the \nright kind of things given in one\u2019s experience: in particular, these typically being things \nfalling under the concept to be learned. The concept of a doorknob is learned from exposures \nto (typical instances of) doorknobs, not giraffes or oysters, say. For Fodor this means that \nhypothesis-testing must be a part of the picture after all, for the learner has to use experiences \nwith doorknobs to test and confirm hypotheses about what property the word \u201cdoorknob\u201d \ndenotes. Indeed, suppose the process of concept acquisition was not so cognitively mediated, \nor \u201cbrutely causal\u201d. Then we would not predict that the concept of a doorknob is typically \nacquired from exposure to doorknobs and doorknobs and them only. But it is. Therefore the \nprocess is not brutely causal. In short, the relation between a concept and the experience from \nwhich it is learned or which it is \u201ctrue of\u201d is a special case of the evidential relation between a \ngeneralization and its confirming instances (Fodor 1998: 127, 132). \nBut then again, ask just when an experience would be a confirming instance of a \ngeneralization formed over what the word \u201cdoorknob\u201d expresses. Clearly, only if it was a \ndoorknob. But this thought the learner cannot think, lacking the concept that figures in it. \nThus hypothesis-testing is not involved, the internalist would conclude. The process in which \na concept that originated on independent grounds is triggered must be \u201cbrutely causal\u201d, and \nthe doorknob\/DOORKNOB problem raised is a reductio of the hypothesis-testing model. \nBut why then is DOORKNOB acquired from doorknobs and not giraffes? The \nappearance may be as unsurprising as the one that organic structures not fitted to particular \nuses are not selected for or selectively retained. The sought relation between the concept of \ndoorknobs and doorknobs is the relation of selection among given variants. It is non-cognitive \n                                                 \n14 It seems similarly unclear how, if part of what\u2019s innate about a concept is a specification of its \u201cproprietary \ntrigger\u201d (ibid.: 138), we would know what trigger is \u201cproprietary\u201d if we do not know the concept it is proprietary \nfor. \n 15\n(and in this sense: brutely causal, though still not arbitrary), and it is non-instructive. This is a \nDarwinian-internalist response to the problem of concept acquisition, and a clear tension \nemerges in combining the view that the primary evolutionary mechanism is a selective one \nwith the view that internal structures such as concepts are externally caused. \n A concept may be like a key that opens a lock, but as in the case of other adaptive \nstructures, the lock need not be referred to in explaining how the concept comes into \nexistence.  \n \n7. Possible Languages \nI have argued that concepts do not arise through content, though they can be individuated in \nterms of their possible content (or possible use), which varying environments then actualize. \nPut differently, while reference does not determine concepts, the environment provides \nexternal referents for concepts within a range of ways permitted by these concepts. This claim \nis testable, since the modalities used in this theoretical commitment imply that certain \nintentional relations would be such that we could not take them up, and that there would be \nCONCEPTS we could not learn, because we did not have, and could not, by the mere power \nof our will, develop the concepts needed for these CONCEPTS.  \nTo exemplify a test of this prediction, we may return to the theory of UG (see section \n4) as capturing the child\u2019s concept of a possible language (itself involving concepts of a \npossible phoneme, word, concept, phrase, etc.), a concept as such not depending on any \nactual language spoken, though any actual instance of a possible language depends, by \nassumption, on it. As a structural type, UG commits us to the human impossibility of certain \nlanguages not obeying the constraints of that type. These latter languages would be logically \npossible (and constructible in the laboratory, so to speak), but the commitment is that they \nwould not be natively learnable by children in the way that actual human languages are. \nSmith and Tsimpli\u2019s (1995) experiments with Christopher, a prodigious language learner with \nsevere cognitive deficits, who could not learn languages in which the experiments included \nsome violation of a principle of UG, exemplifies just this.15 \nWhile, of course, in some intuitive sense, children \u201clearn\u201d languages, it is an empirical \nquestion whether human languages are learnable in the sense required for externalist and \nempiricist learning theories. There is no constraint in human biology for languages to be \nlearnable in the latter sense, just as there is no constraint in human biology for immune \nresponses to be so learnable. On the view that language acquisition is rather enabled by UG \u2013 \nthat is, UG is viewed as a \u201clanguage acquisition device\u201d or LAD \u2013 UG, as characterizing the \nchild\u2019s mind, provides \u201cchannels\u201d within which experience is bound to flow. We know this \nacquisition process to be surprisingly independent of a large amount of feedback, corrections, \nand environmental control parameters, hence of hypothesis-testing in the Fodorian sense. \nAlso in the case of the lexicon, the minor role that feedback and correction play in the child\u2019s \nacquisition of a vocabulary, its effortlessness, speed, and essential uniformity, despite a great \nvariance in scanty evidence and cultural background, and the little specificity of the sensory \ninput needed, all conspire to suggest that this is the right conclusion, too. The inductive gap \nbetween the system of knowledge attained and the evidence on which this happens seems \nequally vast.16 \n                                                 \n15 Examples of \u201cimpossible words\u201d in the sense of Hale and Keyser (2002) are another case in point. These are \nwords derived in violation of a syntactic constraint, and hence not natively learnable (e.g., the invented transitive \nverb book as in *He booked on the shelf, with the meaning He put the books on the shelf. Still another case may \nbe concepts that are impossible, not on syntactic, but on categorization grounds, such as the concept of a thing \ncomprised of the four legs of a cow, which, as opposed to things like a flock or a hand that also consist of \nvarious parts, is not one unified thing for a creature with a conceptual system like ours. \n16 See further Bloom (2000), and Gleitman and Landau (1994). Chomsky (2000: 120) points to \u201cthe rate of \nlexical acquisition (...), with lexical items typically acquired on a single exposure, in highly ambiguous \n 16\nOne can describe the process of learning a language without bringing any \nrepresentational notion of propositional attitude into play, of the sort that centrally figures in a \nFodorian \u201cComputational-Representational Theory of Mind\u201d. The child (as opposed to the \nlinguist) needs no more beliefs or a \u201ctheory\u201d of which structures develop in its head and get \nselected than it does in the case of other biological organs. Nor does it need to represent the \ncontents of such a theory. The relational notion of representation drops out of the conceptual \nframework of the theory of UG, as it is not clear how understanding of the language faculty \nand its use is enhanced by letting structures in the organism \u201crepresent\u201d or \u201ccorrespond\u201d to \nconstructs in the environment of which they are \u201ctrue\u201d (see also fn. 14). In short, the theory of \nthe LAD as investigated in the biolinguistic framework gives relational notions of \u201ccontent\u201d \nor \u201cpropositional attitude\u201d no explanatory role to play (see further Chomsky 2003a).   \nGenerative grammar in this way remains instructive for its lack of support for the \nhypothesis-testing model and the externalist idea of learning as based on representationally \nunderstood propositional attitudes. But it also teaches a philosophical moral regarding the \n\u201csemanticality\u201d of concepts in my sense: the range of conceptual structures determining a \n(humanly) possible language variant, while not being defined or generated relationally, are \nalso not semantically inert. As I described it, they delineate a possible content. The concepts \ninvolved will not determine the contents of the child\u2019s actual experiences \u2013 since it is a \nhistorical matter of what linguistic environments it will happen to be placed in \u2013 but it will \ndetermine what French, Bantu and German have in common. This is also a content (though a \nmore abstract one), and not merely a \u201cform\u201d. It is in this sense that concepts in the sense of \nthis paper, though they are part of the organism\u2019s intrinsic structure and thus independent of \nan environment that the organism is placed in, have a \u201ccontent\u201d. They do not \u201creach out\u201d to \nthe world in the sense of determining whether French or German is spoken, but they have \nsemanticality all the same.17   \n8. Conclusions \nI have argued for the good use of a notion of \u2018concept\u2019 on which concepts enter into the \nexplanation of meaningful reference and language use, while not being either intensions or \nworldly extensions. They do not come into existence through their functioning in an \nenvironment, nor do they cause their functioning. The origination of concepts and their \nfunctioning must be kept apart. Applying a Darwinian rather than Spencerian conception of \nprogressive evolution to the case of concept and language learning thus suggests abandoning \nprevailing tendencies to regard the environment as a (direct or indirect) cause of our concepts. \nWhile externalism appears to be a general tendency in our intuitive thought, the empirical \nstudy of the human language faculty does not suggest, as of now, to give external function an \nexplanatory role to play in the genesis of that part of our cognitive structure and design. A \nserious doubt concerning the explanatory significance of notions such as content, \nrepresentation, and reference, appears warranted. \nThe picture I have defended endorses nativism in the form of what amounts to a truism \nin a biological context: the organism\u2019s response to the environment depends on its internal \nresources, and in a Darwinian frame of mind, internal cognitive structures will not generally \narise from reference or function, or from standing in causal relations, alone. Nativism thus \nunderstood \u2013 a form of biological internalism as inaugurated in the 19th century (see \nAmundson 1998 and Gould 2002, Ch. 4) \u2013 gives rise to a basic conflict with current \n                                                                                                                                                        \ncircumstances, but understood in delicate and extraordinary complexity that goes vastly beyond what is recorded \nin the most comprehensive dictionary\u201d. \n17 The older notion of a synthetic a priori judgement in the Kantian sense is what is needed here: the child\u2019s \njudgements on what a possible human language is are a priori \u2013 they do not derive from experience \u2013 but they \nare not analytic, for they have a content in the sense just described: the structure of UG does provide substantive \ninformation, which follows from nothing in logic. \n 17\nexternalism, if the latter is to be more than the non-contentious claim that what our internal \nconcepts end up being used to refer to is a matter of history, contingency, and chance.  \nReferences \n \nAnderson, S.
