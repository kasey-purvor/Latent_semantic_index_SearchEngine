It revisits Bick\u2019s original 1964 paper and explores current divergences\nfrom her original practice in the context of contemporary theories of psycho-\nanalysis and adjacent disciplines and of relevant changes in society. It draws on\nthe personal recollections of Bick\u2019s early students as well as the expanding\npublished literature. It discusses seminar technique, the training of seminar\nleaders, and clinical and research applications of the observational method.\nKeywords: child psychotherapy training; technique of observation; cultural\ncontext; preparation of teachers; clinical and research applications\nSixty years is a substantial period of time in psychoanalytic history and seems an\nappropriate moment to review some of the history of Esther Bick\u2019s remarkable\ninvention, and to discuss some contemporary lines of development. Over the\nlast, there has been a steady flow of significant publications about Bick and\nInfant Observation, and the impact of her delineation of a form of observation\nrooted in psychoanalysis continues to grow. International conferences provide a\ncontext for exploring the different ways in which child observational practice is\nlocated both culturally and institutionally, and the substantial numbers of people\nattending such conferences is impressive. This paper will start from the\nbeginnings in London, and draw on the experience of past and present\ngenerations of Tavistock observers.\nI am going to begin with what I am sure is a foundational text for everyone,\nBick\u2019s 1964 paper. This was the first account in published form of the practice of\nInfant Observation, developed from 1948 onwards in the Tavistock child\npsychotherapy training that John Bowlby had invited her to organize, and later\nin 1960 also forming part of the Institute of Psychoanalysis training in London.\nThis paper was originally presented at the International Congress of Infant Observation\nin Buenos Aires in August 2008.\n*E-mail: mrustin@tavi-port.nhs.uk\nISSN 1369-8036 print\/ISSN 1745-8943\n# 2009 Tavistock Clinic Foundation\nDOI: 10.1080\/13698030902731691\nhttp:\/\/www.informaworld.com\nInfant Observation\nVol. 12, No. 1, April 2009, 29\u000241\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nI want to pick out some of her formulations and also comment on particular\npoints from a present day perspective, while emphasizing how splendidly clear\nand authoritative an introduction to our field it remains. It is hardly surprising\nthat the frequency of citation of this paper is extraordinarily high.\nMy first point is that it is absolutely evident how closely linked Bick\u2019s\nthinking about the function of Infant Observation was to her commitment to\ntraining psychoanalytic child psychotherapists. She wished it to give her students\n\u2018some practical experience of infants\u2019 to prepare them for clinical work with\nchildren, in which they will be attuned to the infantile elements in their patients\u2019\nmaterial. In similar vein, she refers to students \u2018interviewing the mother\u2019 about a\nchild\u2019s history, implying how much they would be helped to understand what a\nmother has to say about a child in emotional difficulties if they have had the\nexperience of longitudinal observation of a mother-infant pair, and can be\nreadily in touch with maternal anxieties in the face of the vulnerabilities of tiny\ninfants. It is interesting to reflect on her assumption that the account would be\ngiven by a mother, without the involvement of the child\u2019s father, which is a\nmarker of the change in beliefs about family life and family responsibilities over\nthe last 50 years. Nowadays I think most of us would very much hope that both\nparents could be involved in initial clinical exploration, and make efforts to bring\nthis about. Bick\u2019s expectation in this matter contrasts with her discussion of the\nobserver\u2019s place in the family home, in which she explicitly refers to both parents\nin describing the subtle and often agonizing process of the observer finding an\nappropriate position during observational visits. One can see that Bick has in\nmind the ordinary comings and goings and complexities of any family, and the\nobserver\u2019s need to be open to the fluidity of who will be present on any particular\noccasion. Although the central observational emphasis is indeed going to be on\nthe baby\u2019s and mother\u2019s experience, the privileged visitor has to find a way to\nrelate to all the members of the household without, as she puts it, \u2018acting out a\nrole\u2019 amongst those which may be offered to her, consciously or unconsciously,\nby the family, or those pressures towards enactment stirred within herself as a\nconsequence of the internal infantile disturbance she will be struggling to contain\nin the face of the encounter with the overwhelming intimacy of the early\nmonths.\nSometimes Bick\u2019s method of Infant Observation has been inaccurately\nportrayed as impossibly rigid in its approach, and it is delightful to remind\nourselves that in this first publication of her ideas she makes it clear that the\nobserver may indeed respond to invitations to hold the baby and give small gifts\non special occasions as part of her developing relationship to the family.\nThe guiding principle she wanted to get across is the importance of resisting\nacting out a role which involves infantile transferences between observer and\nfamily members, in either direction, while being present in the moment as fully\nas possible, open to perceiving as much as possible. The \u2018free-floating attention\u2019\nfamiliar in psychoanalytic practice which Bick wants observers to achieve is what\nwill potentially give access to adequate remembered detail on the one hand, and\n30 M. Rustin\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \naccess to the observer\u2019s own emotional responses on the other*both those\nrecollected subsequently by the observer and those emerging in the later seminar\ndiscussion. This, of course, is why from the start she did not want people to take\nnotes during the observation since such activity would prevent the student from\n\u2018responding easily to the emotional demands of the mother\u2019. This makes one\nthink about the vital importance of face-to-face contact between mother and\ninfant and the echo of this in all later relationships where intimacy and\nunderstanding is involved. The observer\u2019s observing eyes and sustained focus on\nmother and baby are what are indeed essential to establishing a relationship with\neach. While in adult psychoanalysis the main focus in terms of perceptual\napparatus is on what is heard and spoken, in infant observation and analytic\nwork with children, the visual field is much more central, and anxieties about\nseeing and being seen are widespread and unavoidable*eyes that look with\nkindness, interest, and stay \u2018in the question\u2019 and by contrast the evil eye, the\nvoyeuristic eye, eyes green with envy and so on, the whole range of ways of\nlooking which involve the eye as an organ of projection rather than of receptivity\n(Rustin, 1989).\nBick was preoccupied with how to gather \u2018objective\u2019 observations, and her\ntechnical proposals addressed this point. Two things strike me particularly. The\nfirst is her warning that observers must bear limitations to their curiosity*the\nunknowable, the mysterious, can, she suggests, \u2018intrigue too much\u2019. Rather like\nBion (1962), in his more or less contemporaneous emphasis on putting up with\nnot-knowing as an essential component in genuine psychoanalytic exploration\n(for patient and analyst), Bick was alert to the need to ally our curiosity about\neach other, which is so much stimulated by Infant Observation with awareness of\nthe risks of intrusiveness and of premature certainties. Her way of conducting\nseminars was very much to describe possible hypotheses about states of mind,\ninteractions and unconscious communications, and to remind everyone that\nfurther observations over time will be the proper basis for confirming or refuting\nthe line of interpretation being developed. The evidence is always limited, and\nonly repeated observation of similar patterns is a basis for more confident claims\nabout the relationships taking shape and the internal worlds of the individuals in\nthe family. The second point is that Bick wrote with the assumption that all\nobservers were in personal analysis throughout the observation and she could\ntherefore rely on analytic scrutiny of observers\u2019 countertransference reactions\nalongside her seminar supervision of the observations. This was consistent with\nthe training function of Infant Observation, which was undertaken at the\nbeginning of both child psychotherapy and psychoanalytic training.\nNow here we come to a very important disjunction with more recent\npractice, and before going on to discuss some of the detailed observational\nexamples in Bick\u2019s paper I would like to address this. There are two kinds of\ndivergence to be noted. First of all, there is the fact that outside the UK, Infant\nObservation is very often practised by qualified psychoanalysts interested to use\nthis methodology as a way of studying early mental development and early object\nInfant Observation 31\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nrelationships, that is, of researching the beginnings of mental life and parent\/\nchild relationships (Sowa, 2002). There has also been growing interest in\nexploring the clinical potential of applied Infant Observation in early\ninterventions (e.g. Boyer & Sorensen, 1999). When observation is part of\npost-qualification professional development, concurrent analysis is not to be\nexpected. The assumption is that the combination of self-analytic capacity and\nthe Infant Observation seminar group do the necessary work to deal with\ncountertransference disturbance in the observer.\nIn the Tavistock tradition, a different divergence from Bick\u2019s practice has\nevolved. In the 1970s, Martha Harris, Bick\u2019s immensely gifted student, who had\ntaken over the running of the Tavistock child psychotherapy training from her,\nexperimented with the idea that a much wider group of professionals working\nwith children and adolescents could benefit from an observationally-based\nintroduction to a psychoanalytic frame of reference (Harris, 1987). She believed\ntheir work would be enriched, and that a broader psychoanalytic culture could\ngrow in the community to the benefit of children and families. She developed an\nexpanded version of what had been the pre-clinical component of the child\npsychotherapy training, and this became the course later led for many years by\nGianna Polacco Williams. It involved not only two years of infant observation\nand a year of young child observation, using very similar methodology, but also\nthe study of psychoanalytic theory and child development, and two years of\nWork Discussion, in which the students presented detailed descriptions of their\nwork in many contexts for exploration (children\u2019s homes, nurseries, schools,\nspecial education, hospitals, clinics, etc.). These seminars drew on the methods\nof clinical supervision and of Infant Observation to create a new form of learning\n(Rustin & Bradley, 2008).\nThis bold endeavour involved the recognition that a considerable number of\npotentially suitable applicants for such a course would not have had any personal\nanalysis, nor would they have the financial resources to begin analysis, as many\nwere in very poorly paid professions. But beyond these pragmatics, Martha\nHarris believed that the decision to enter analysis was often optimally a\nconsequence of being able to begin to recognize the importance of infantile\nelements in our adult lives, an event often brought into being by the exposure to\nInfant Observation and psychoanalytic thinking and its potential for creative\ndisturbance of complacency.\nThis change involved taking responsibility for the possible risks inherent in\nthe widening of the scope of Infant Observation teaching. Considerable thought\nwent into this. There were two obvious issues to tackle*firstly the vulnerability\nof observers and families to the distress which could arise from an observation\nwhich ran into difficulties, and secondly the matter of the training of a wider\npool of infant observation seminar leaders. To protect students, a combination\nof adequate personal support and some firm guidelines about when it was\nappropriate for someone to begin an observation was required. Support was\nprovided by a personal tutor system for each student, but was of course also in\n32 M. Rustin\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \npart supplied through the expanded integrated and intellectually coherent\nseminar programme of the course. Students were attending at least two seminars\na week in small groups of five (Infant Observation and Work Discussion) as well\nas larger theoretical seminars. They were also part of an institution with an\nexcellent library, a fairly large group of senior child psychotherapists who\ncombined clinical work with teaching on the Observation course and the Child\nPsychotherapy clinical training. The question of suitability as an observer was\nnot often problematic since people who came on the course had had personal\ninterviews and were all working with children or adolescents professionally as a\npre-requisite for application. (Nowadays they all have to have police checks in\naddition, in our more regulated world, where anxiety about adults doing harm to\nchildren has become of such public concern.) However, from time to time there\nwere problematic individuals. The way of dealing with a seminar\u2019s leader\u2019s\nconcern that a given student was not a suitable observer (either for the sake of the\nstudent\u2019s perceived vulnerability or because of concerns about the impact he or\nshe might have on the family) was to impose a delay. The student could attend\nseminars and the matter would be kept under review. Occasionally this led to\nsomeone never undertaking an Observation. More often, after a year\u2019s experience\nof the seminar and tutorial help, when some individual personal therapy could\nbe proposed to the student as a necessary way forward, it was then possible for\nthe student to begin an Observation. Circumstances when a delay was proposed\nincluded observers who had very recently had babies of their own and students\nfrom abroad with rather limited linguistic fluency as well as those where\npersonality difficulties were a concern. It is notable that in the hundreds of\nInfant Observations undertaken from the Tavistock course over the years, there\nhave been very few where one would feel that the observer\u2019s limitations gave rise\nto difficulties for the family. In my 21 years as head of child psychotherapy at the\nTavistock, I only once had to deal with a complaint from a family about their\nexperience of being observed.\nI would like to return later to the question about the training of seminar\nleaders, and at this point take you back to Bick\u2019s paper. Her wonderfully\nevocative account of two Observations is introduced by her statement that she\nwill focus on her surprise at the strength of maternal depressive trends, after an\ninitial state of manic elation. Here she is referring to elements of regression to\npart-object relations, a collapse of more integrated functioning, and depressive\ntrends in the sense of Klein\u2019s theory of anxieties characteristic of the depressive\nposition (Klein, 1935). She describes two features, which could become\nsignificant pressures on the observer, the first to \u2018augment the vitality\u2019 of the\ndepressed mother, and the other to \u2018identify with the baby\u2019s resentment\u2019. Here is\nthe characteristic double pressure of the observer\u2019s responsiveness both to the\nmother\u2019s state of mind and to the baby\u2019s.\nIn Bick\u2019s first example, she tries to tease out the observer\u2019s problem of feeling\npulled \u2018into a dependent role\u2019. This she defines as arising from feeling bounced\nbetween identification with mother and baby and thus losing any sense of an\nInfant Observation 33\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nindependent position, a position from which the objective observations Bick\nseeks can be made. Only when one becomes aware of the subjective pressures\n(being \u2018nudged\u2019 into \u2018acting in\u2019 as we might now put it) rescues the possibility of\nproperly establishing the observational role. This points to the enormous\nimportance of the seminar and seminar leader\u2019s role.\nBick\u2019s second example explores the impact of maternal depression on the\nobserver. In this more extended example, she underlines the importance of\nconsecutive observations to clarify patterns of behaviour and changes in pattern.\nShe discusses the baby\u2019s differential relationship to the two breasts and the\nmeaning of baby\u2019s intense crying when undressed. She describes two forms of\ncommunication between mother and baby, visual\/vocal contact as the fulcrum of\nhappiness, and kinaesthetic activity by a baby who was very quiet but who\nfrequently reached for and touched mother and later the bottle. We get a sense of\nactually being in Bick\u2019s seminar in reading this material, and I think this is\ncharacteristic of the best writing about Infant Observation, as, for example in\nMartha Harris\u2019s recently published supervision of Romana Negri\u2019s observation\n(Negri & Harris, 2007).\nBick\u2019s aim is to gather a wide array of Observations which give a picture of\noverall behaviour and trends. Her emphasis on building up a picture over time\nand taking account of a mass of detail reminds me of Joseph\u2019s later concept of\nthe \u2018total transference\u2019 (Joseph, 1989). In fact, the Infant Observation seminar\u2019s\nwork over two years often does enable a gradual integration of elements of the\nobservational experience. The papers written by Tavistock students in the second\nyear of the baby\u2019s life usually have a convincing narrative to tell of the baby\u2019s\ndeveloping relationships, in which the observer\u2019s subjective experience has been\nprocessed to contribute to the understanding achieved. The increasing body of\npublications about Infant Observation in the Infant Observation Journal and\nelsewhere is a consequence, I think, of the confidence we now have in the\nreliability of our method of work and also the improved quality of the written\naccounts of Infant Observation students provide since the course became\naccredited at Masters level by the University of East London (Briggs, 2002; Reid,\n1997; Sternberg, 2005).\nIn reviewing what Bick says about her method, I have had access to three very\ninteresting sources of information outside the published material. Mary Boston\nwas one of the members of the first ever Infant Observation seminar in 1948 and\nshe has described to me the way in which Bick\u2019s ideas evolved. The story is\nfascinating evidence of her openness to evolution. She started her three students\noff observing babies placed in nursery care, not at that time having imagined the\npossibility of observers negotiating a place in an ordinary family home. All the\nstudents were very nervous, aware of Bick\u2019s exacting expectation of detail, but all\nbecame intensely involved with her in following the development of the infants\nthey observed. Shirley Hoxter has told me that just a few years later, when\nObservation in family homes was the expectation, Mrs. Bick arranged the family\nin which Shirley was to observe. In fact, the professional links between Mrs. Bick\n34 M. Rustin\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nand the family were a source of anxiety for Shirley, and it is clear that in the early\ndays of Infant Observation, as of child psychoanalysis, boundary conventions\nwere different. At the point where Dilys Daws, whose material features in the\n1964 paper, did her Infant Observation, Mrs. Bick taught the seminar for the\nfirst year of the observation and John Bowlby took over for the second. Their\nperspectives were very different, since while she was intensely focussed on the\ninternal developments and on unconscious phantasy, he was much more\nattentive to external events, attachment precursors (he was beginning his work\non that) and child development at a behavioural level. It must have been quite an\nexperience for the students! They apparently argued with Bowlby, as they were\ntremendously committed to Bick\u2019s psychoanalytic frame of reference and did not\nunderstand his ideas! (D. Daws, personal communication, June 10, 2008) Later,\nhis teaching on the course was done separately from the Infant Observation\nseminar.\nDilys Daws kindly lent me some detailed notes of a seminar discussion held\nin about 1960 in which Mrs. Bick reviewed the development of Sam, one of the\nbabies being observed in the seminar group of five. She began with some broad\nreflections on method*the fact that the continuity of visits partially offsets the\nlimitations of one hour per week of observation; that the observer needs to be\nmeticulous in recording behaviour and in not inferring the feelings of the baby\ntoo quickly and thus losing the evidence on which the interpretation was based;\nthat the observer\u2019s comments can enrich or distort the material, and need to be\nsubject to careful inquiry. She also suggested that while one can learn much from\ncomparing one baby\u2019s behaviour in many different situations, familiarity with\nmany babies opens one\u2019s eyes to the very wide range of individual differences as\nwell as to the common experiences of infancy.\nThey then moved on to thinking about 10-month-old Sam, described as a\nvery placid baby. Bick\u2019s view of his placidity was striking*she saw him as failing\nto reach out to other people, or towards the different parts of his own body. She\nlinked this with his mother\u2019s difficulty in the first three months in really letting\nthe baby have an impact on her. Sam seemed quite inhibited in his arm\nmovements and Bick thought that he demonstrated a low capacity for enjoying\nlife. In noting Sam\u2019s absence of ordinary infantile physical symptoms, she\nsuggested that this was evidence of his failure to register and struggle with his\nexperience, a tendency to bypass difficulties.\nSam avoided close eye contact, and Bick proposed that his eyes were the\norgans of greatest importance to him, used both to drink in his environment and\nalso to express his aggression which had been split off from his musculature\nand mouth. These comments give a vivid impression of her way of thinking and\ncome in the form of a dialogue with seminar members, which has a very open\nquality.\nLater (in the year I started Infant Observation) Martha Harris took over the\nseminar from Mrs. Bick, and others began to teach too, according to the model\nshe had established at the Tavistock. Meanwhile, two other developments were\nInfant Observation 35\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nin progress. One was the one-year Infant Observation established in the\npsychoanalytic training course in London, and the other was Bick\u2019s supervision\nof people coming from abroad to learn her observation and clinical methods.\nThis brings us back to the question of the preparation of Infant Observation\nteachers. The well-known seminar described in Magagna\u2019s 1987 paper was the\nresult of a request by a group of qualified child psychotherapists, who had all\nthemselves completed a two-year Observation as part of their training, for her to\nrun an Infant Observation seminar, one of whose purposes was to help them feel\nbetter equipped as teachers. Magagna\u2019s paper describes important variations in\nmethod*only one Observation was presented, although at least two had initially\nbeen planned (perhaps because the group was much too large for the normal\nmethod to work). Furthermore, summaries of the previous seminar\u2019s discussion\nwere reviewed, which was a new idea. This practice is now used by some but not\nall Infant Observation teachers in traditional small seminar groups. The baby\nwas referred to as \u2018baby\u2019, not by name, creating an archetypal atmosphere. Even\nmore striking is that the seminar members were described as mostly mute*one\nmight speculate that this was because everyone knew that this was the last\nseminar Bick would conduct and felt they wanted to hear every word she might\nsay. The lone observer\u2019s feeling of exposure was intensified, because she\npresented every week and her work was the total focus of the group. Magagna\nwrote about being acutely aware of the role she occupied in the family as\nvariously critic, outsider, intruder and competitive expert with the mother, and\nof her vulnerability to identification with the baby, including becoming ill in\nsympathy.\nHow should we think about preparing new teachers at this point in time? At\nthe Tavistock, we have had several different ways of tackling this. Martha Harris\noffered supervisory discussion to anxious first-time teachers and also the\nopportunity to sit in on her seminars and observe the seminar process as well\nas being part of it. She also ran an Infant Observation seminar for a group of\npeople doing a second Infant Observation as a precursor to becoming teachers.\nSimilar arrangements have continued to be developed in different places, and our\nmore recent addition has been a seminar for new teachers at which the material\nbrought to their seminar is brought alongside their own written account of the\nseminar process. This has proved a fascinating learning experience and we are\nable to use a video-conference link to open the seminar to others teaching\noutside London.\nI now want to turn to some other important issues and will group my\nreflections on more recent developments under four headings. First, the changes\nin the observational setting related to social changes over the last 60 years. The\nfamilies which Bick\u2019s early generations of observers visited were all intact two-\nparent families, mostly comfortable middle class but also including some secure\nworking class families. Current observers are exposed to a much wider range of\nexperience. London has become a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural city, with high\nproportions of immigrants in some areas. This introduces us to observing in\n36 M. Rustin\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nfamilies in which English is a second language, and may not be fluently spoken\nor ordinarily spoken at home, at least by the older members of the family. For\nexample, children from families from the Indian sub-continent often first learn\nEnglish at school with mothers not necessarily learning English at all. Observers\nhave to negotiate subtle complexities in establishing themselves in families which\nmay have very different ways of organising family life from those they are\nfamiliar with. The research project jointly led by Cathy Urwin which uses Infant\nObservation as part of an investigation of the experience of first-time mothers in\ndifferent ethnic groups in East London has provided interesting detailed material\nexploring this territory (Urwin, 2007).\nWe had noticed for some time that the proportion of families keen to have\nobservers who were recent arrivals in London was quite high, and hypothesised\nthat the absence of family support for mothers far from home was a significant\nfactor. Observers who would make a long-term regular commitment to visiting\nand taking a close interest in the growth of a baby seemed perhaps to partly\nreplace the missing extended family, bringing a new and challenging dimension\nto the transference to the observer. Some of these families seemed especially\nvulnerable, and Stephen Briggs\u2019 1997 study investigated this, making use of\nGianna Williams\u2019 theory of flat, convex and concave containment as an\nelaboration of the phenomenon of failures in early maternal containment.\nOther social changes include a high proportion of single mothers in British\ncities, a much greater involvement of fathers in infant care, and an expanded use\nof nannies and nurseries among middle class professionals where the expectation\nand often financial necessity is for mothers to return to employment after\nmaternity leave. Assisted pregnancies and adoption have also made it possible for\nlesbian and homosexual couples to bring up babies. All these realities come to be\nrepresented over time in the range of Observations undertaken. Seminar leaders\noften have quite difficult decisions to make in advising students about how to set\nup an Observation, since individuals can sometimes have a strong preference for\nsettling on a particular sort of family, which may be too closely linked to their\nown values, beliefs or anxieties. The sociological lens offered by the range of\nobservational material in a typical contemporary seminar is fascinating as an\nadjunct to the psychoanalytic study of the interior of the family, and is of course\none of the sources of increasing interdisciplinary interest in Bick\u2019s methodology\n(Hollway, 2007).\nThe second area I want to touch on briefly is the issue of changes in the\ntechnique of the seminar leader. This is a large theme, and examples which have\ninterested me include offering role-play at the start of a seminar to help students\nprepare for an initial meeting with parents or to imagine how to deal with the\npresence of a needy toddler alongside the new baby. In settings in which Infant\nObservation is quite unknown or where it proves difficult for observers to find a\nfamily, seminar leaders sometimes present their own material in initial seminars,\nto give people a first taste of the emotional impact of the experience. Others have\nused published texts, though this seems to have the great disadvantage of\nInfant Observation 37\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nintroducing students to already-theorised material, rather than the unprocessed\nmessier data of observational notes. The expansion of empirical laboratory-based\nchild development and attachment research (Stern, 1985), and neuro-science,\nevolutionary psychology and anthropology (Panksepp, 1998; Hrdy, 2000) has\nled to some teachers making links to theories derived from these disciplines.\nI think this has similar disadvantages to the premature introduction of explicit\npsychoanalytic theory, though we have to be aware that our responses to Infant\nObservational material are in fact shaped by powerful underlying theoretical\nconceptions. Without an understanding of containment, projective identifica-\ntion, splitting, unconscious phantasy, autistic phenomena, and so on, our\ninterpretative activity would be impossible.\nA major area of creative development is the clinical application of\nObservation, especially in early interventions. These span participative adapta-\ntions of classical Observation to respond to major difficulties between mother\nand baby and research-oriented work using more active forms of Observation to\nbuild links between mother and infant in their own home (Gretton, 2006). The\nlevels of mental pain and mindlessness that observers have to be capable of\ntolerating in visiting profoundly compromised mother-baby couples is immense,\nand the need for individual supervision is obvious. These highly specialised\ninterventions are, of course, only appropriate for trained clinicians who have\nprior experience of ordinary Observations. The clinical relevance of Infant\nObservation in brief work with mothers and babies struggling with ordinary\ndevelopmental difficulties has been widely recognised and is well represented in\nthe published literature (Emanuel & Bradley, 2008). Similarly well known is the\nuse made of Observation in clinical work with autistic children and their\nfamilies. This includes extended family assessments (Alvarez & Reid, 1999) as\nwell as child psychotherapy with non-speaking autistic children in which close\nObservation is the main resource of the clinician. Bick\u2019s later development of the\ntheory of the Second Skin (Bick, 1968) has been found widely applicable to the\nmany children now seen by child psychotherapists with neglected or maltreated\nearly histories, and both Tustin\u2019s and Meltzer\u2019s theories about autism derive in\nmajor ways from her understanding of infancy.\nAware that this journal\u2019s readership is more used to detailed material than to\nthe overview I have provided, I would like to include here just one example of\ninitial intervention with a toddler adopted at 17 months and his parents. I first\nmet them when Ted was aged 20 months. The parents were overwhelmed,\ndesperately unhappy, and distraught about the future. Ted was hyper-active and\nextremely aggressive, threw things constantly, hit and bit unpredictably, and\ncould only utter high-pitched screams which they described as animal-like. Their\nolder adopted son, aged three and a half, was terrified of him. He slept little and\nthe crisis his arrival had precipitated included both parents falling ill with\npneumonia. The parents felt they had allowed into their family a monster, not a\nlittle boy, and thought he was psychopathic or autistic. In my initial\nconsultation, Ted\u2019s behaviour was indeed wild and toys were used as missiles.\n38 M. Rustin\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nHe required constant adult vigilance, but both parents felt rejected rather than\nrelated to because of his frequent violence. However, he allowed himself to rest\nfor a moment lying on his father\u2019s lap on the floor to drink from his bottle. I felt\nI had established contact with Ted by talking about his interest in the door, his\nwish to be followed and kept safe, and his idea that he had to make Mummy and\nDaddy and myself know how afraid he was. I had thus been describing his\nbehaviour as if it had meaning, which the parents doubted, and I now decided to\nintervene. I put the soft baby doll on my lap and made her watch Ted drinking\nand then say that she was hungry and wanted a drink too. To the parents\u2019\namazement, Ted came over and proffered her an imaginary drink from the toy\nteacups I had put out on a low table in front of me. Some ordinary toddler\npretend-play was possible at this point, and I think this allowed the parents to\nperceive Ted as a child with a mind and as someone who could be understood.\nThis revival of hope was a very important first step in my work with this family.\nThe opportunity to intervene in the difficulties occurring in the complex\nsituations which are now the norm among adoptions in Britain also interest a\nnumber of my colleagues, and clinical research projects planned include\nObservations of babies placed in foster care whose futures are uncertain. The\nhope is both to provide support for the foster mothers to become able to be more\nclosely involved with the babies, and also offer consultation to social workers\nabout future planning for the children, many of whom stay in foster care for\nyears because of uncertainties about possible return to birth parents. The\nchildren\u2019s underlying difficulties currently tend only to become apparent when\nthey start school at age five, when their incapacities to learn, play and relate to\nother children become painfully evident.\nOne other recent venture I should mention finally is that when the BBC\nmade six television programmes about the work of the Tavistock, they were keen\nto include one about Infant Observation. This led to a lot of thought about how\nwe should respond and we ultimately arranged two Observations negotiated on\nthe basis of weekly filming over the period of one year\u2019s observation, and also\nagreed to the filming of the seminars at which these two observations were\npresented. Thus some awareness of Infant Observation reached a wide television\naudience in Britain and we were subsequently able to use parts of the BBC film\nto make an educational film of our own, Observation Observed (Rustin & Miller,\n2002), now available on DVD, which combines an account of the fundamental\nideas of Infant Observation with excerpts from the two Observations.\nConclusion\nThis has inevitably been a selective overview of Bick\u2019s inheritance to which much\ncould be added by my colleagues at the Tavistock and in the many other settings\nacross the world in which Infant Observation is now practised. I think she would\nbe utterly astonished by the spread of interest in her creation. What I hope I have\nconveyed is the sense of discovery at the heart of her enterprise, both the\nInfant Observation 39\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n9:1\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \ndiscovery of facts about early development, and of a psychoanalytically-based\nmethodology for investigating it. For Bick, this went in parallel with her clinical\nwork with children and adults, and the numbers of people involved with Infant\nObservation in her lifetime remained quite small. However, her ambition to\nexpand the understanding of early infantile life was built on Klein\u2019s theories as\nshe always made clear to me in the clinical supervision I had with her. The\nsecond case on which she supervised me was a psychotic young child born\nprematurely whose experience of bodily persecution was intense. Mrs. Bick\u2019s way\nof helping me enter into the strange world my patient inhabited often took the\nform of her showing me, using her hands, the bizarre ways in which my patient\nattempted to protect herself from primitive fears of annihilation. The terror of\nendless falling, which she understood as part of a normal small baby\u2019s fears, still\ndominated my patient\u2019s life. Bick\u2019s work was undertaken at the same time as\nBion was writing about the early development of the capacity to think. These\ndevelopments in the psychoanalytic paradigm were part of a period of immense\nfertility in British psychoanalysis. Her passionate conviction in the human\nrelevance of the insights gained from Infant Observation was profound, and that\nis what seems to have travelled so impressively across the world and continues to\ninspire.\nReferences\nAlvarez, A. & Reid, S.
