In this paper, we argue instead\nfor risk-adjusted customer lifetime value, which we term the economic value of a\ncustomer, as the means for marketing to assess both customer profitability and\nshareholder value gains.\nWe report on the empirical measurement of economic value of customers through a\ncollaborative case study analysis of business-to-business relationships in the financial\nservice industry. One direct consequence of measuring this risk and the economic\nvalue of key account customers was a customer portfolio review which led to changes\nin their relationship marketing strategies and improvements in shareholder value for\nthe firm.\nWe conclude the paper by highlighting the limitations of our research and discussing\nselective customer retention through lifetime value analysis and a risk-adjustment\nprocess as the means for developing relationship marketing strategies.\nThis paper contributes to the field by extending the discussion on customer risk and\ndemonstrating a method that managers can readily adopt to evaluate the risk of their\ncustomers.\n2Key Words\nRelationship marketing: risk-adjusted customer lifetime value: shareholder value\nanalysis: longitudinal study.\nIntroduction\nIt is now widely accepted that the real purpose of the business is to create and sustain\nmutually beneficial relationships with selected customers. Since the emergence of\nrelationship marketing in the 1980s, defined by Berry (1983) as \u201cattracting,\nmaintaining and enhancing customer relationships\u201d, there have been growing\nconcerns about the validity of the traditional marketing approach which emphasises\ncustomer acquisition and a transaction-based view of sales (Levitt, 1986; Christopher,\nPayne and Ballantyne, 1991, 2003; Gr\u00f6nroos, 1994).\nIn contrast, relationship marketing (RM) offers firms the opportunity to build long-\nterm customer relationships and to regard these relationships as a key marketing asset\nwithin the firm (Hunt, 1997; Kutner and Cripps, 1997; Varadarajan and Jayachandran,\n1999). In balancing the need to develop customer acquisition and retention strategies,\nReichheld and Sasser (1990) and Reichheld (1996) argue that firms can improve their\nprofitability as customer retention increases; their research shows that a small\nimprovement in customer retention rates from, say, 85% to 90%, results in net present\nvalue profits rising from 35% to 95% amongst the businesses they examined. This\nresearch has been very influential in drawing attention to the critical role customer\nretention plays in developing a RM strategy. Whilst most firms now talk the rhetoric\n3of RM, recent research amongst 200 of the UK\u2019s largest organisations suggests that\nabout 90% of these firms are still not allocating their marketing budget appropriately\n(Christopher, Payne and Ballantyne, 2003). Eighty per cent of these firms tend to\nover-invest in customer acquisition, whilst 10% spend too much on customer\nretention activities. Only about 10%, the \u201cprofit maximisers\u201d, consider they have the\nbalance about right.\nThe \u201cprofit maximising\u201d calculations which underlie efforts to balance marketing\nspending on customer acquisition and customer retention are usually based either on\nsingle-period customer profitability or on forecasts of customer lifetime value.\nHowever, maximising customer profitability, whether calculated for the single period\nor in net present value terms, may not be the most appropriate metric for measuring\nthe value of customer relationships and for managing RM strategies (Ryals, 2002a).\nIf marketing\u2019s contribution is to create shareholder value (Doyle, 2000), then\ncustomer relationships should be measured \u2013 and managed \u2013 for value rather than\nprofit. Shareholder value analysis takes a longer term perspective and is a better\nmeasure of performance than profit since it enables marketers to consider investment\nrisks in customer relationships as well as their returns (Rappaport, 1986; Cornelius\nand Davies, 1997).\nMeasuring shareholder value\nShareholder value measures the true returns to shareholders after all costs - including\nall costs of capital - have been deducted, whereas accounting profit deducts only the\ncost of debt, not the cost of equity (Stewart, 1991; Cornelius and Davies, 1997). To\ncreate shareholder value, investments in projects or in marketing assets must return\n4more than the cost of capital (Mariotti, 1996; Cornelius and Davies, 1997). For this\nreason, the notion of risk is intrinsic to the concept of shareholder value. Shareholder\nvalue is created only when returns exceed the cost of capital. The cost of capital\nreflects risk. For this reason, discounted cash flow calculations which use a notional\ndiscount rate, rather than the true cost of capital, do not measure value creation.\nApplying shareholder value notions to marketing, this means that there are problems\nwith both customer profitability and customer lifetime value measures. In addition,\nresearch shows that most companies do not measure customer profitability despite\nacknowledging its importance (Reinartz and Kumar, 2002). These issues will now be\ndiscussed.\nMeasuring the profitability of customers\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit (1998) found that customer profitability and\ncustomer lifetime sales were two of the top three most important customer-related\nperformance measures that the companies in their survey would be monitoring in the\nfuture. However, they also found that most firms were measuring customer\nprofitability in a top-down way based on the level of sales, the increase in order\nvolume and the size of transactions. This approach, also known as RFM (Recency,\nFrequency and Monetary Value) is considered to be flawed (Reinartz and Kumar,\n2002).\nA frequently-encountered difficulty for companies wishing to measure customer\nprofitability is that management accounting and reporting systems tend to reflect\nproduct profitability rather than customer profitability. Where product profitability is\nknown, the direct product costs of customer purchases can be determined with\n5reasonable accuracy. Indirect costs (principally the costs of sales, marketing and\ngeneral administration [SGA]) are then allocated across the customer base, often in\nproportion to the total sales of each customer. However, this approach assumes each\ncustomer uses equivalent amounts of company time and effort in relation to sales\nrevenue; whereas some customers are just more costly to serve than others, often due\nto their behaviour. For instance, new customers may demand more information about\nproducts and service levels, seek to customise the offer as far as possible and then buy\non a limited basis as a trial measure. The costs to serve this customer, excluding\nacquisition costs, point towards an overstatement of profitability in the period. By\ncontrast, customers who purchase on a regular basis and whose purchasing habits are\nroutine and predictable, are relatively easy to serve. Thus, the profitability of such\ncustomers stemming from a proportional allocation of costs can be understated. The\nhigher the proportion of indirect costs (in relation to product costs), the more\nmisleading a simple proportional allocation becomes. Howell and Soucy (1990) show\nthat SGA costs have grown significantly and now represent 20-40% of total costs in\nFortune 500 companies.\nCustomer Profitability: Looking Forwards, not Backwards\nA fundamental problem which applies to all current (and historical) customer\nprofitability analysis is that it does not necessarily act as a guide to the future (Wilson,\n1996). Basing relationship marketing strategies on such data could be damaging to\nlonger-term value creation. Once a firm has recognised the importance of building\ncustomer relationships, marketing and sales need to decide which customers they want\nto build closer relationships with in the future. As companies move towards one-to-\n6one marketing, they need to develop a longer-term view of the value of their customer\nrelationships than current data can provide (Peppers and Rogers, 1994; 1997; 1998).\nEffectively, relationship marketers need to predict the future purchasing behaviour of\nkey customers to arrive at their Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV; Ryals, 2002b).\nCLTV looks at what the retained customer is worth to the organisation now, based on\nthe predicted future transactions and costs. Looking forward to the value of future\npurchases and costs, expressed as the present value of a stream of future profits, fits\nmore comfortably with the development of a RM approach which is concerned with\nunlocking value for the firm and its key customers. Forward-looking customer\nlifetime value measures are also more consistent with the principles of shareholder\nvalue creation.\nTo calculate the lifetime value of a customer (CLTV), three sorts of information are\nneeded: the anticipated lifetime of the customer relationship in months or years; the\nprofit in each future period adjusted for any customer-specific capital costs, such as\nmarketing and customised services; and a discount rate (Figure 1).\n[Take in Figure 1]\nHowever, even if CLTV calculations are reliable and show a positive CLTV, i.e. the\nfirm can accurately predict that a customer\u2019s future spending patterns exceed the cost\nof acquiring future sales, it is still possible to destroy shareholder value as the\nrelationship develops (Reinartz and Kumar, 2002).\n7Customer Lifetime Value and Shareholder Value\nCLTV analysis suggests that the value of a relationship with a customer can be\nincreased either by increasing the amount of profit (by increasing the revenue from\nthe customer and\/or decreasing costs to serve), or by extending the relationship\nlifetime. Customers at the beginning of their relationship lifetime will need a\ndifferent RM strategy to those approaching the declining stage of their relationship\nlifetime. Retail banks understand this principle well; they have identified students as\npotentially high value customers over a lifetime, even though in the short term they\nmay be unprofitable. So, CLTV calculations, often used to measure the profit impact\nof customer retention strategies, provide a better guide for customer strategy than\ncurrent period profit (Dorman and Hassan, 1996).\nHowever, neither single-period profitability nor CLTV effectively account for the risk\nin developing a customer relationship. This is the reason why seemingly profitable\nactivities (such as investments in customer relationships) can be misleading, showing\napparent growth whilst providing minimal or negative returns to shareholders\n(Rappaport, 1986). It has been argued that shareholder value measures that include\nrisk measurement should be applied to the calculation of the value of customers\n(Mariotti, 1996; Uyemara, 1997). We would argue, therefore, that an adjustment to\nCLTV is needed to offset the profits earned against the risk of investing in the\nrelationship. So, in assessing customer risk, we need to anticipate risk in the revenue\nstreams and the costs-to-serve a customer, particularly those customers who have\nbeen designated for significant investment for their future growth potential. The\n8combination of forecast CLTV and future customer risk we term the economic value\nof a customer.\nThe Economic Value (EV) of a Customer\nIn the same way that projects and investments must yield more than the cost of capital\nto create shareholder value (Stewart, 1991; Cornelius and Davies, 1997), the risk-\nadjusted return from a customer must more than compensate for the investment made\nin that customer if marketing is to contribute to shareholder value (Mariotti, 1996;\nUyemara, 1997). Such customer investments might include developing bespoke\nservices, the cost of time taken to understand their business, and the support of a\ncustomer development team in managing the relationship. When companies apply\nthis thinking to their customer portfolio, it is likely they will find they have some\ncustomers who create value but others who destroy shareholder value (Figure 2).\nTake in Figure 2\nDoyle (2000) argues that it is this type of economic value measure which enables\nrelationship marketers to develop a better understanding of shareholder value and its\nlinks to customer retention and lifetime value. As a key asset of the firm, customer\nrelationships need investment, just as tangible assets do, despite the fact they are not\n\u201cowned\u201d in the same way (Wayland and Cole, 1994). In fact, if they choose,\ncustomers can defect to competing suppliers. Thus, accounting for value in a\ncustomer relationship not only implies a value exchange over time (Slywotzky, 1995)\n9but also a risk assessment of individual customers or customer segments (Dhar and\nGlazer, 2003).\nModelling the EV of a customer\nThe model we use in this paper to measure the economic value of a customer\nrelationship is derived from the literature on relationship marketing and customer\nretention (e.g. Reichheld and Sasser, 1990; Christopher, Payne and Ballantyne, 1991,\n2003; Gr\u00f6nroos, 1994; Hamilton, Howcroft and Saunders, 1995; Reichheld, 1996,\n2000; Jenkins, 1997) and the risk literature related to shareholder value analysis\n(Stewart, 1991; McTaggart, Kontes and Mankins, 1994; Mariotti, 1996; Cornelius and\nDavies, 1997; Uyemara, 1997) and is shown in Figure 3:\n[Take in Figure 3]\nNext, we apply these principles to show how CLTV and EV are calculated in an\ninternational insurance company and what impact this has in developing the firm\u2019s\nRM strategies and shareholder value. The company in question is Zurich (London)1,\na subsidiary of the Zurich-based international insurer, and its business is to provide\ninsurance cover, from fire to loss-of-profits, for its corporate clients.\nDeveloping the research models at Zurich (London)\n1 We should make it clear that Zurich (London) is the brand name, not the name on the company\u2019s\ninsurance contracts.\n10\nIn order to overcome the problems of privileged access (Balmer, 2001), the\nresearchers first presented their ideas on measuring the CLTV and EV of customers to\nthe senior management of Zurich. In extended discussions with the firm, the proposed\nmethodological approach of collaborative case study analysis and the benefits derived\nfrom such collaboration were endorsed and the agreement to proceed given.\nGiven the complex nature of the research task, we were most anxious to establish a\nresearch methodology and protocol which not only enabled the collection of rich data\n(Carson, Gilmore, Perry and Gronhaug, 2001), but also required the active\ninvolvement of participating managers to help generate this data in conjunction with\nthe researchers (Knox and Bickerton, 2003).\nZurich was chosen as the participating company for a number of different reasons:\n\uf0b7 As an insurance company with a portfolio of international customers, the firm\u2019s\nCustomer Delivery Team has detailed customer information on the key accounts it\nmanaged and understands the notion of customer risk as well as returns.\n\uf0b7 The Customer Delivery Team, although newly-formed, is accustomed to working\nwith customers in the long term and was able to forecast future revenues and\ncosts, adjusted for risk and the cost of capital, even where it did not already do so.\n\uf0b7 As a new team, the idea of collaborative research which involved full\nparticipation, but which held uncertainty both in process and outcome\n(Gummesson, 2000) was appealing to them. The view of the 5 executives directly\ninvolved in the project (and the auxiliary team members drawn from senior\nactuaries, senior managers and account managers of non-key accounts) was that\n11\nan improved understanding of the value of their customers would help strengthen\ncustomer plans, improve resource allocations and contribute to more effective\nrelationship marketing strategies.\nData Capture and the Unit of Analysis\nThroughout the project lifetime of 18 months, both models were discussed, developed\nand agreed through researcher intervention with the Customer Delivery Team (CDT)\nand the auxiliary members, as appropriate. This included workshops, face-to-face\ninterviews and the iteration of 22 spreadsheets2 to arrive at CLTV and the final\nestimation of the economic value of each key account. In total, researcher\nintervention occurred on 14 separate occasions, prior to debrief and the i\nimplementation of revised RM strategies which the researchers subsequently returned\nto discuss.\nThe accuracy of quantitative data was checked in two ways. Successive versions of\nthe spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel) were fed back to members of the CDT and their\nviews solicited. This led to considerable changes in the forecasts. Other quantitative\ndata were checked for accuracy of calculation and transcribed by a third party who\nhad data entry experience.\nOf Zurich\u2019s several hundred corporate customers, twelve were regarded as the main\nkey accounts and generated approximately 17 % of total revenue. It is these key\naccounts that form the unit of analysis and are drawn from eight industry sectors,\n2 Once the models were established after 22 iterations, i.e. earlier versions of the spreadsheet were\ndiscounted as items were introduced or removed, the process of estimating CLTV or economic value\nfor each account was the same.\n12\nranging from I.T. and Telecoms, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, business services,\nhotels and leisure, to a charitable foundation. In this paper, two of these accounts are\ndiscussed in detail to illustrate how CLTV and EV are calculated.\nCalculation of CLTV\nGiven that the nature of the insurance business is to provide cover against claims, the\nresearch models have been adapted to reflect the specific nature of the industry.\nHowever, they are generalisable: the revenue items are analogous to product or\nservice purchases in other industries and the cost items are generalisable to product\ncosts and costs-to-serve. In total, three calculations are identified as necessary to\ncapture the CLTV value of a customer at Zurich. They are shown below in the\ncomposite model (figure 4) in the following sequence (1a\uf0e0 2\uf0e0 3\uf0e0 CLTV):\n[Take in Figure 4]\nThe CLTVs of the 12 key account relationships were developed individually.\nHowever, for the sake of parsimony, we will only report our research findings for two\nof these accounts: Customer B, a hotel group, and Customer L, a charitable\nfoundation. These customers have been selected for three main reasons:\n\uf0b7 Both customers had been insured through Zurich for 6 and 16 years respectively\nwhich meant each relationship was in a mature phase (no other key account had a\nlonger history with the company).\n\uf0b7 The perception of the value of both customer relationships (estimated as perceived\nprofitability before model development, and their economic value afterwards)\n13\nchanged during the project lifetime. This led to direct changes in how both\naccounts were managed and in the RM strategies adopted.\n\uf0b7 The team felt confident that their forecasts for these accounts could be estimated\nwith some accuracy since their insurance requirements and claims behaviours\nwere reasonably predictable.\n1a. Revenue Forecasts for Customers B and L\nThe average actual relationship lifetime of the CDT\u2019s customers was 4 years 3\nmonths. Therefore, the calculations of CLV and EV are based on a relationship\nlifetime of 4 years (current year plus three).\nRevenues are derived from two sources:\n\uf0b7 Net Earned Premiums: the premiums after reinsurance, i.e. the income\nreceived on the actual proportion of the risk that Zurich is to bear. If the\ninsurance risk of the customer increases, the gross premium will increase;\nhowever, Zurich may decide to reduce its exposure to this insurance risk by\nreinsuring a greater proportion of the gross premium. This would have the\napparent effect of reducing the revenues from a riskier customer. To remove\nthis complication, the net earned premiums only are considered, and the costs\nof reinsurance are excluded from the calculation.\n\uf0b7 Other revenues: fees received by Zurich for managing relationships with\ncaptive insurance companies (that is, insurance subsidiaries of non-insurance\ncompanies); for other services such as risk consultancy; and from the sales of\nnew products, such as software products.\n14\nThese revenue forecasts are shown in Figure 5:\n[Take in Figure 5]\nRevenue growth for both accounts depends upon growth in net earned premiums,\nwhich is relationship-dependent. As commitment and trust builds, the firm anticipates\nenjoying a greater share of insurance expenditure from the client (Coyles and Gokey,\n2002). Forecasts for Customer B show this effect strongly; whilst for Customer L it is\nmore modest.\n2. Cost Forecasts\nThe costs-to-serve for each key account consists of two direct and one indirect\ncost. These costs are:\nDirect Costs\n\uf0b7 Underwriting services: costs and salaries. These were the direct sales and\nservice costs of looking after the customer.\n\uf0b7 Cost of Claims. This is the cost of processing claims (number of claims x cost\nper claim).\nIndirect Cost\n\uf0b7 Network Costs. These were costs of issuing policy documents and internal\nprocessing within the company.\nThe cost forecasts for Customers B and L are shown in Figure 6.\n[Take in Figure 6]\nThe differing costs-to-serve between Customer B and Customer L need a brief\nexplanation:\n15\nUnderwriting services represent the amount of time spent by the CDT and senior\ncolleagues in managing the relationship and resolving problems. On larger and more\ncomplex accounts, more time is needed for RM purposes. In the case of Customer B\nand Customer L, the absolute amounts are very different but, proportional to revenues\nfrom net earned premiums, they are relatively similar.\nClaims costs, the costs of processing claims, are determined by the number of claims\ngenerated by the client which, in turn, depend upon the type of insurance written and\nthe risk management ability of the client. Many small claims are more costly to\nprocess than a single claim, no matter how large the latter may be. For its size,\nCustomer L has a relatively high claims processing cost.\nNetwork costs are Zurich\u2019s central costs associated with issuing documents, contracts\netc. These costs depend on the number and complexity of contracts which, in turn,\nreflect the number of insurance products that the customer purchases and their internal\norganisational structure (number of different geographical areas covered, number of\nbusiness units, degree of centralisation of risk management). Customers B and L both\nhave network costs proportional to the size of their business with Zurich. However,\nnetwork costs were expected to increase for B because of some anticipated changes in\nits business structure.\n3. Present Value Calculations\n16\nThe CLTVs for customers B and L are then calculated from revenue and cost\nforecasts adjusted for present value using Zurich\u2019s weighted average cost of capital\n(4.8%). Figure 7 shows that the CLTV of Customer B is \u00a31,237,000 and Customer\nL is \u00a3199,000.\n[Take in Figure 7]\nWhilst both customers B and L remain profitable, as their CLTV calculations show,\nthe unexpected discovery that other key accounts in the portfolio were unprofitable\nimmediately raised a number of issues about the strategies that were used to manage\nthem. This, in turn, led to a consideration of the risks associated with managing key\naccounts and, hence, to the economic value (EV) of the customer.\nFrom CLTV to the EV of a Customer\nIn our composite model (figure 4), EV can be derived from CLTV calculations by\nassessing the risk in customer revenue streams on a customer by customer basis (1a\n\uf0e8 1b\uf0e8 2\uf0e8 3\uf0e8 EV). Two risk adjustments are made in our model.\n1b. Risk-adjusting the revenue forecasts\nThe risk of the customer can be considered to be the volatility of future revenue\nstreams. To reflect this, we developed measures against two specific aspects of\ncustomer risk profiling: customer-specific claims risk, the proportion of insurance\nclaims as a % of net earned premium which is also expressed as a probability; and\nrelationship risk, a forecast probability of customer retention.\n17\nUnlike the portfolio claims risk used to calculate CLTV (figure 5; 67%), the\nclaims risk is now customer-specific and therefore part of economic value.\nCustomer-specific insurance claims risk may be a significant factor in EV.\nInsurance companies are exceptional in that the profits from their customers are\nlimited by the premium but massive losses are possible with large claims. This\ncontrasts with some other commercial relationships where profit is more variable\nthan costs.\nThe customer-specific claims risk was calculated by the CDT based on known\nprevious claims experiences and forecasts of products purchased by the customer.\nIn the cases of Customers B and L, the risk of higher claims by Customer L (60%\ncompared to 30% for B on an annual basis in figure 8) may seem curious at first,\nsince L is a charitable foundation whereas B is a leisure company. However, the\ndifferences in claims risk relate to the type of insurance written, the CDT\u2019s\nunderstanding of the customer and, particularly, the risk management process\nwithin the customer business. Customer B has a risk management team whereas\nCustomer L does not; therefore, the internal risk management process is stronger\nfor B than for L, making it a lower claims risk for Zurich. These customer-\nspecific claims risks are applied only to the Net Earned Premium (NEP) since the\nother revenue streams are independent of claims.\nRelationship risk is based on a prediction by the CDT of the likelihood that that\nkey customer would be retained, year by year. The forecast probability of\nretention is applied to all revenues, including net earned premiums and other\n18\nrevenues (fronting fees, fee-based income and product sales are grouped as \u2018other\nrevenues\u2019 for simplicity in figure 8).\nWe calculate the economic value of both accounts by bringing together the risk-\nadjusted revenues, subtracting the costs, and adjusting to present value by Zurich\u2019s\nweighted average cost of capital. In this case, costs to serve are not affected by the\nrisk of the customer, although in applications of the model to other situations they\nmay be.\nThe EV of Customer B is shown to be \u00a31,902,000 (Figure 8) compared to a CLTV of\n\u00a31,237,000 (Figure 7), and the EV of Customer L is \u00a3165,000 against a CLTV of\n\u00a3199,000. Customer B is low risk and, whilst there is a slight risk of defection in later\nyears, the economic value of this customer reflects the fact that its claims risk profile\nis less than half of the portfolio average. Thus, the CLTV of Customer B understates\nits true economic value. Customer L has a slightly higher risk of defection and a\nclaims risk that is close to the portfolio average; for these reasons, Customer L\u2019s\nCLTV overstates its economic value.\n[Take in Figure 8]\nThe greater the divergence of customer risk from the portfolio norm, the greater the\ndifference between CLTV and EV. We would argue, therefore, that the economic\nvalue calculations shown above are particularly important for high-risk customers as\nthey may be considerably less valuable to the organisation than their CLTV would\nsuggest.\n19\nThe flat, risk-adjusted revenue forecast for Customer L is in marked contrast to the\nforecast growth in revenues for this account based on projected sales. Moreover,\nCustomer L has a higher proportion of revenues coming from fronting fees, which are\nless volatile than net earned premiums.\nThe differences between risk-adjusted and non risk-adjusted revenues raise issues\nabout the real value of customers, as does the contrast between CLTV and EV. Thus,\nthe measurement of customer risk and the EV of a customer is important in\ndeveloping appropriate customer strategies. This is certainly true for Zurich, both at a\ncustomer portfolio level and at individual account level, and for most other firms who\nmanage their customers (or customer segments) through RM strategies. We discuss\nboth aspects of the Zurich\u2019s key account strategy in the next section.\nManaging Zurich\u2019s Key Account Portfolio for EV\nIn this section, we consider the impact of calculating economic value on the key\naccount portfolio as a whole. Moving from perceived profitability and CLTV to the\nEV of the customer results in marked differences in the relative profitability of key\naccounts as our data show (Figure 9). Accounting for risk generally indicates a\ndampening of the future profitability of existing customers which runs counter to\nsome previous studies on the impact of customer retention (for example, Reichheld,\n1996) and the supposition that more would be known about longer duration\ncustomers. It seems that these beneficial effects of customer retention are being\neroded by the negative effects of the \u2018pincer\u2019 exerted by long-term customers of\n20\ndownwards price pressure coupled with upwards demands for claims and service\n(Kalwani and Narayandas, 1995; Reinartz and Kumar, 2002).\n[Take in Figure 9]\nThree new key accounts (not shown in Figure 9) had been won during the period and\nthey now occupy rank places 1, 2, and 3, indicating that new accounts tend to be more\nprofitable. Our research undoubtedly influenced the behaviour of the CDT as they are\nnow clearer about the costs to serve a customer; this impacts on their negotiations\nwith prospective customers in that they built in these forecast costs into their\nproposals. Thus, new customers are being acquired on more favourable terms (to\nZurich) than had prevailed with existing customers. This is a particularly striking\ndevelopment as it is taking place at a time when insurance rates in the market are\ngenerally softer than they have been in the previous few years.\nBased on its EV, rather than CLTV, Customer B\u2019s relative position in the portfolio is\nslightly reduced (6th compared to 4th). Nonetheless, it is still a big and important\ncustomer to Zurich so the management of this account has not changed substantially\nas a result of the analysis. However, Customer L appears to be considerably less\nvaluable than the CDT had first thought. This was noticeable after the CLTV\ncalculation and even more so after its EV had been measured and compared to the rest\nof the key account portfolio. Prior to our research, this account was perceived to be\nthe most profitable of all. This finding persuaded the key account manager for\nCustomer L to be more cautious in the amount of time and resource committed to the\naccount.\n21\nRisk is a particularly important issue when considering customers C and H, not only\nbecause of the way risk is managed within each company but also from an industry\nperspective as both their sectors are inherently risky. Customer C\u2019s position improves\nfrom 12th to 7th because risk is exceptionally well managed within the company. So,\nalthough the industry itself was as risky as Customer H\u2019s, customer C\u2019s risk profile\nincreases its EV. In contrast, Customer H does not have a significant risk\nmanagement capability, which results in a downgrade in its EV.\nFinally, a mention of Customer J which remained unprofitable throughout our\nresearch, particularly when assessed for risk. The CDT members reviewed their\nrelationship with Customer J very carefully indeed but concluded that, as a very high\nprofile company and brand name with the ability to attract others, it is worthwhile\nretaining as a key account for reference and referral purposes (Ryals, 2002a; Wilson\n1996).\nChanges to Zurich\u2019s Relationship Marketing Strategy\nOur research suggests that the EV (and lifetime value) of the customer relationships\nwhich drive company profitability may not be fully understood. Figure 9 illustrates\ntwo related aspects of the problem which can affect shareholder value: differing\nopinions about the relative profitability of customers amongst senior management\nbased on their own judgements; and the differences between perceived customer\nprofitability (where a consensus exists) and their actual profitability as revealed by\nresearch of this type. The implication we draw from this is that inappropriate amounts\nof management time and resource may be allocated to customers whose economic\n22\nvalue does not justify such expenditure. Conversely, other customers with greater\neconomic value may be underinvested. The appropriate relationship management\nstrategy will depend on whether, and to what extent, the risk of defection can be\nreduced and the EV of the customer thereby increased. In some cases, the optimal\nstrategy would be to reduce the costs to serve low EV customers and use the resources\nreleased to acquire other, higher value customers. In other cases, the most effective\nstrategy would be to analyse the components of defection risk and manage the\nrelationship so as to reduce the risk and increase the EV of the customer.\nUpon concluding our research, Zurich\u2019s CDT felt that they had sufficient insight and\nconfidence to make certain changes to their customer relationship marketing\npractices. For instance, customers N and O, now regarded as relatively unprofitable,\nwere moved to the care of industry teams handling major accounts (but not key\naccounts) so the costs to serve them could be lower. In the case of Customer N, this\ndecision was made not just on cost grounds but also from an understanding that the\naccount was low risk and low maintenance and did not warrant resourcing by key\naccount management.\nGenerally, the reaction of the CDT to our research has been to adjust their service\nlevels and they are increasingly seen as tougher negotiators by their professional\nintermediaries. They are now able sometimes to charge for services that had\npreviously been provided free to existing customers. The senior management involved\nin our research commented at debrief that they had become more concerned about\nobtaining a return on incremental marketing effort and were less likely to provide\nadditional services to customers without asking for payment in return. This change in\n23\nbehaviour impacts the costs-to-serve and helps contain cost inflation across key\naccounts.\nAnother change to their RM strategies concerns resource allocation and how key\naccount managers spend their time. Overall, the average probability of customer\nretention amongst key accounts is about 75% annually. However, this average\nconceals considerable variations. In cases where the probability of customer retention\nappears relatively low, a change in strategy is called for. As a consequence, the team\nnow discusses how they should allocate their time against these particular accounts. If\nthey can rectify the problem with the relationship and increase the probability of\nretention, then this is their priority. If this does not seem possible, account managers\nthen ensure that they spend enough time on business development activities in order\nto attract new customers to replace these accounts in the event that they defect.\nLimitations and future research directions\nAs we have mentioned above, many aspects of the model and of the research design\nare of general applicability, especially the development of CLTV and of the risk\nelement in customer relationships. Following Uyemara (1997) and Mariotti (1996),\nwe would argue for the application of shareholder value measures to CLTV,\nparticularly the measurement of customer risk. Although our research and the dearth\nof literature on the subject of customer risk suggest that the concept is not well\nunderstood, customer risk is a live topic for marketing (Dhar and Glazer, 2003).\n24\nIn opening up this whole field of customer risk and EV to discussion, we must\nacknowledge a number of limitations in our research design. One such limitation is\nthat we have restricted the definition of relationship risk so that it is concerned\nprincipally with customer defection over time. By our own admission, this is a\ncircumscribed view of customer risk. Even in the insurance industry, which\nunderstands the notion of risk as well as returns, the tools to measure certain aspects\nof customer risk are in their infancy. Future researchers may attempt to incorporate\nand quantify other customer risks, such as change of ownership and leadership, major\nchanges of strategy or, topically, fraud and default risk. This broadening of customer\nrisk measures would serve to improve our understanding of the EV of customers.\nA second limitation concerns the specialized nature of the research task we have\nundertaken: working with a senior management team across a small sample of\ncustomers in the insurance industry. We recognise that customer risk differs according\nto industry circumstance and competitive intensity, and the reasons why customers\nthemselves are considered high, medium or low risk can vary over time as\nmanagement gain insights about their behaviours through their R.M. practices.\nIn response to this, there are a number of future research directions that could be\nfollowed, such as measuring the EV of customers within different industries or\nresearching how a firm\u2019s relationship marketing strategies can be adapted according\nto the risk profiles of their customers over time, and the impact this has on the EV of\nthe customer.\nA third limitation that became a frustration was our inability to collect full data on all\nthe customers studied; this was a consequence of the longitudinal research process we\n25\nused. Key account customers arrived and departed during the project; in fact, the\nuniverse of key account customers studied amounted to 18, although we have been\nable only to present data on 12, and full data on 10 of these. Changes to the key\ncustomer portfolio during the research meant that direct comparisons were not always\npossible; however, we felt that this limitation was acceptable given that the\nlongitudinal research design made it possible for us to change the system and the\nways in which customer relationships were perceived and managed. Future\nresearchers may take a larger customer sample, possibly across market segments\nrather than in a key account context, and EV measures made over a shorter time\nperiod so that any effects from customer defection can be reduced.\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we set out to argue that there is still a significant gap between the R.M.\nstrategies practised by most companies and the espoused strategies called for by\nReichheld and others which focus more on customer retention than acquisition.\nIf there is to be a greater emphasis on customer retention, we maintain (against\nReichheld\u2019s general view) that it should be focused on the customers with the greatest\nlifetime value rather than simply increasing customer retention overall. Any\ndiscussion of differential customer retention and lifetime value immediately raises the\nissue of how the value of such a customer relationship is to be measured and\nmanaged.\n26\nDrawing on the literature on shareholder value, we argue that customer lifetime value\nmeasures should be adjusted for risk in order to determine the EV of the customer.\nWorking with Zurich\u2019s Customer Development Team in business-to-business\ninsurance, we develop a customer lifetime value analysis and a risk-adjustment\nprocess to calculate the EV of the firm\u2019s key accounts.\nThe results of our research demonstrate that the measurement of the EV of a\ncustomer is both viable and implementable as a management tool, impacting on both\nrelationship marketing strategies and shareholder value gains. The future challenge\nfor researchers will be adapting these principles of risk-adjusted CLTV for use in\nother industry sectors where relationship marketing practices and CLTV measures are\nbecoming the norm.\nReferences\nBalmer, J.
