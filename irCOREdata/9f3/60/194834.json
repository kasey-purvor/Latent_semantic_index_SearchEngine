These sources, characterized by high X-ray luminosities\n(LX >\u223c 5 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121) and X-ray-to-optical flux ratios similar\nto those of AGN (\u22121 <\u223c Log ( FxFopt ) <\u223c 1), have been named in\na variety of ways: Optically Dull Galaxies (Elvis et al. 1981);\nPassive Galaxies (Griffiths et al.1995) and more recently X-ray\nArticle published by EDP Sciences and available at http:\/\/www.aanda.org or http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1051\/0004-6361:20030625\n484 P. Severgnini et al.: AGN posing as optically normal galaxies\nBright Optically Normal Galaxies (XBONG, Comastri et al.\n2002b). If an AGN is really present in their nuclei, the lack\nof evident optical emission lines has to be justified. Different\nscenarios have been proposed so far: a) the AGN is a BL Lac\nobject; b) the nuclear activity is outshone by the stellar contin-\nuum; c) the lines could not be efficiently produced or they could\nbe absorbed by material beyond the NLR. Although the broad-\nband properties of one XBONG in the HELLAS2XMM survey\n(Brusa et al. 2002) are consistent with the presence of a BL\nLac object, which are usually X-ray unobscured sources, most\nof the optically dull galaxies seem to be obscured in the X-ray\ndomain (Mainieri et al. 2002). This last finding is mainly based\non the hardness ratio analysis (Barger et al. 2001a,b, 2002;\nComastri et al. 2003). Recently, Moran et al. (2002) have ob-\ntained integrated (i.e. nucleus+host galaxy) optical spectra of a\nsample of nearby Seyfert 2 galaxies obscured in the X-ray band\nin order to simulate ground-based spectroscopic observations\nof the more distant X-ray optically dull galaxies under investi-\ngation in deep Chandra surveys. They find that, due to the lim-\nitations of optical spectroscopic observations (e.g. wide slits,\nlow resolution, low signal-to-noise, inadequate spectral cover-\nage), optically type 2, X-ray obscured AGN could be easily\nundetected in the optical band. In this context, Comastri et al.\n(2003) have recently shown that the distribution of X-ray-to-\noptical flux ratio of XBONG sources could be well reproduced\nassuming that the underlying SED of the putative AGN is that\nof an X-ray Compton-thick AGN. In spite of this, the nature\nof this kind of sources is still far from being completely un-\nderstood. Indeed, in the majority of the cases, the poor X-ray\nstatistics obtained so far on this class of sources has not allowed\nus to unambiguously establish the presence of an AGN nor to\nstudy its nature.\nIn this paper we present new XMM-Newton and optical\ndata for 3 sources belonging to the XMM Bright Serendipitous\nSample (XMM-BSS hereafter, Della Ceca et al. 2002a;\nDella Ceca 2002b). On the basis of the optical spectra avail-\nable from the literature or taken as a part of the AXIS1 project\n(Barcons et al. 2002, 2003), these three XMM-BSS sources\nwere classified, at first glance, as normal galaxies. The same\nsources should be instead classified as AGN candidates on the\nbasis of their X-ray luminosities and their X-ray-to-optical flux\nratios (see Sect. 2). With the aim of investigating the true na-\nture of these three objects we have studied, thanks to the good\nX-ray statistics of the XMM-Newton data, their X-ray spectral\nproperties (see Sect. 3). This analysis has allowed us to de-\nvelop a simple model (described in Sect. 4.1) which, starting\nfrom the X-ray properties of the AGN present in these sources,\nhas allowed us to explain: a) why the nuclear emission is un-\ndetected in the optical spectra already available and b) what\nkind of optical observations are needed to unveil the AGN also\nin the optical domain. Subsequent spectroscopic observations\nperformed with a more suitable observational set-up (i.e. nar-\nrower slits or larger spectral coverage) have allowed us to un-\nveil the AGN features in the optical band. The main results\nobtained for each source are discussed in Sects. 4.2, 4.3 and\n1 http:\/\/www.ifca.unican.es\/\u223cxray\/AXIS\/\nthe conclusions are reported in Sect. 5. Throughout this paper\nwe assume H0 = 65 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and \u2126M = 0.3, \u2126\u039b = 0.7.\n2. XMM-BSS optical dull galaxies: Broad-band\nproperties\nThe XMM-BSS sample is an on-going project carried out by\nthe XMM Survey Science Centre (XMM-SSC, Watson et al.\n2001) with the aim of complementing the results obtained\nby the deep Chandra surveys (CDF-N, Brandt et al. 2001;\nCDF-S, Rosati et al. 2002; Giacconi et al. 2002) and by the\ndeep (Lockman Hole; Hasinger et al. 2001) and medium-\ndeep XMM-Newton surveys (AXIS, Barcons et al. 2002, 2003;\nHELLAS2XMM, Baldi et al. 2002). It is planned as a large\n(\u223c1000 sources), high Galactic latitude (|b II| > 20o) sample of\nbright (FX > 10\u221213 cgs) serendipitous XMM-Newton sources.\nThe sample definition and selection criteria are described in\nDella Ceca et al. (2002a, 2002b, 2003 in preparation).\nThe relevant information on the optical and X-ray proper-\nties of the 3 sources discussed here are listed in Table 1. The\nfirst column gives an identification number that, for simplicity,\nwill be used in this paper in place of the full XMM-Newton\nname reported in Col. 2. Columns 3\u20138 give: R magnitudes,\nredshifts, X-ray fluxes and luminosities corrected only for the\nGalactic absorption, and X-ray-to-optical flux ratios. Since the\nMOS calibration files are usually the best ones, the fluxes and\nluminosities used in this paper have been computed on the basis\nof the MOS data.\nThe optical finding charts are shown in Fig. 1 and more in-\nformation on the individual sources are reported in the follow-\ning sections. Sources #1 and #3 have been classified as normal\ngalaxies on the basis of preliminary optical spectra taken by\nthe AXIS project (Barcons et al. 2002, 2003), while the optical\nclassification of source #2 is taken from Katgert et al. (1998).\nOnly for source #1 the optical spectrum available covers the\nregion where the H\u03b1 line is expected (\u223c6852 \u00c5), while for the\nremaining two sources the H\u03b1 region is not sampled.\nThe X-ray properties of these three sources strongly sug-\ngest the presence of AGN activity: they have an X-ray lumi-\nnosity L2\u221210 keV >1042 erg s\u22121 (see Table 1) and an X-ray-to-\noptical flux ratio similar to the typical value of luminous AGN\n(\u22121 <\u223c Log ( FxFopt ) <\u223c 1; Maccacaro et al. 1988; Schmidt et al.\n1998; Akiyama et al. 2000; Lehmann et al. 2001).\nAll the 3 sources presented here lie within the area covered\nby the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and they have been\ndetected in all near-infrared (NIR) bands (J,H,K). The R \u2212 K\ncolors of the 3 sources are in agreement with those expected\nfor a normal galaxy (e.g. Mannucci et al. 2001).\nFor source #1 radio information is available from the Very\nLarge Array (VLA) survey in the Subaru field region. The ra-\ndio flux density is 325 \u00b1 33 \u00b5Jy at 1.4 GHz (Simpson et al.\nprivate communication), giving a power of 3\u00d710 21 W\/Hz, typ-\nical of a radio-quiet AGN. Source #2 is covered neither by the\nNVSS (NRAO VLA Sky Survey, Condon et al. 1998) nor by the\nFIRST (Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm, Becker\net al. 1995) survey, while source #3, that lies within the area\ncovered by the FIRST survey, does not have a radio counterpart\nP.

XMM-Newton data\nIn this section we present the XMM-Newton data. The data\nhave been processed using the SAS (Science Analysis System)\nversion 5.3.3. Events files released from the standard pipeline\nhave been filtered for high background time intervals. We have\nused the latest calibration files released by the EPIC team to\ncreate new response matrices that include also the correction\nfor the effective area at the source position in the detector. The\nrelevant information about the XMM-Newton observations are\nreported in Table 2. In particular the table lists: source identi-\nfication numbers (Col. 1), observation IDs (Col. 2), exposure\ntimes after removing time intervals affected by background\nflares and taking into account all the instruments used (Col. 3),\nnet counts from all the instruments used (Col. 4), detectors used\nfor the scientific analysis (Col. 5).\n3.1. Spectral analysis\nAt the spatial resolution of XMM-Newton EPIC instruments,\nthe 3 observed sources appear point-like. The X-ray spectra\nhave been extracted using circular regions of appropriate radius\n(from 25\u2032\u2032 to 30\u2032\u2032). Background spectra have been extracted\nfrom larger (from 50\u2032\u2032 to 60\u2032\u2032) source-free circular regions close\nto the object. In order to improve the statistics, MOS1 and\nMOS2 data obtained with the same filter have been combined\ntogether and, finally, MOS and PN spectra have been binned in\norder to have at least 20 counts per energy channel.\nThe spectral analysis described in the following has been\nperformed using XSPEC 11.0.1. Afterwards, unless otherwise\nstated, errors are given at the 90% confidence level for one in-\nteresting parameter (\u2206\u03c72 = 2.71). For each source, the MOS\nand PN spectra have been fitted simultaneously in the 0.5\u2013\n10 keV band, leaving free the relative normalizations. In the fit-\nting procedure, the appropriate Galactic hydrogen column den-\nsity along the line of sight has been taken into account (Dickey\n& Lockman 1990).\nTwo spectra (#2 and #3) are well described by a single\nabsorbed power-law model. A pure thermal component is\nrejected for all the sources at more than 97% confidence level\nand the addition of a thermal component to the power-law\nmodel is not statistically required.\nA good fit for source #1 is obtained with a two component\nmodel: a \u201cleaky absorbed power-law continuum 2\u201d plus a cold\nIron 6.4 keV emission line; the addition of the latter improves\nthe fit at more than 99% confidence level. A more detailed de-\nscription of the X-ray properties of this source will be reported\nin a forthcoming paper by Watson et al. (in preparation). For\nall the 3 sources, the relevant best fit parameters, quoted in the\nrest frame, are summarized in Table 3 along with the unab-\nsorbed luminosities. The best fit unfolded spectra and residuals\nare shown in Figs. 2 to 4.\nIn summary, we find that all the spectra are well described\nby a power-law model. A thermal component is not required\nby the fit, in agreement with the point-like appearance of the\nX-ray emission and with the lack of evident clusters\/groups\nin the optical images. These facts, combined with the high in-\ntrinsic X-ray luminosities of these objects, clearly suggest the\npresence of an AGN. A cold 6.4 keV Iron emission line com-\nponent is required only for source #1. The equivalent width\n(EWFe\u2212K\u03b1 \u223c 300 eV) of this line is typical of a Compton-thin\nAGN (Bassani et al. 1999). For the remaining two sources the\nupper limits on the EWFe\u2212K\u03b1 are at least a factor 2 lower (at\nthe 90% confidence level) than the typical value expected for a\nCompton-thick AGN (\u223c1 keV; Bassani et al. 1999).\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Investigating the lack of optical emission lines\nHaving established, from the X-ray analysis, the presence of\nAGN in the apparently normal galaxies presented here, we now\ninvestigate if the lack of significant emission lines in their opti-\ncal spectra could be explained even assuming a standard AGN.\nTo this end we use a simple model based on an AGN plus\n2 Consists of an absorbed plus an unabsorbed power-law with the\nsame photon index.\n486 P.

The approach used for each source is summarized in the\nfollowing steps:\n1. the AGN template is normalized at 2500 \u00c5 on the basis of\nthe unabsorbed, rest-frame, 2 keV flux using a starting value\nof \u03b1ox5 = 1.5 (the typical value of high-luminosity Seyfert and\nquasars, Brandt et al. 2000);\n3 The noise is not included in our templates.\n4 The Bruzual & Charlot (2000) models have been retrieved via\nanonymous ftp: ftp.iap.fr\n5 The \u03b1ox is defined here from 2500 \u00c5 to 2 keV in the rest frame:\n\u03b1ox = \u2212 log ( f2500 \u00c5\/ f2 keV) \/ log (\u03bd2500 \u00c5\/\u03bd2 keV).\n2. assuming a Galactic standard value of E B\u2212V\/NH = 1.7 \u00d7\n10\u221222 mag cm\u22122 (Bohlin et al. 1978) and using the intrinsic NH\nvalue derived from the X-ray spectral analysis, the continuum\nand the broad line components of the AGN template are ab-\nsorbed;\n3. the AGN template is redshifted to the z of the source and\nsummed with a redshifted early-type galaxy template. While\nthe optical flux of the AGN template is then fixed on the ba-\nsis of the X-ray properties and the chosen \u03b1ox, the optical nor-\nmalization of the host galaxy is set to reproduce the available\nspectrum. The latter is normalized to the photometric data in\nthe R band (see Table 1) or, if possible, to the fraction of the\ntotal light which has passed through the used slit, taking into\nP.

The resulting \u03b1ox represents then an upper limit on\nthe \u03b1ox of the hidden AGN.\nIn the next sections we discuss the results obtained for each\nof the 3 sources.\n4.2. Source #1\nSource #1 has an X-ray spectrum typical of an obscured AGN.\nIn this case the torus intercepts the line of sight and both the\ncentral engine and the Broad Line Region (BLR) should be\nhidden. On the basis of the AGN unified model (Antonucci\net al. 1993) the optical spectrum should then be character-\nized by narrow emission lines produced by the Narrow Line\nFig. 3. XMM J031859.2-441627.6 (source #2) \u2013 Upper panel:\nPN+MOS spectrum in energy units (unfolded spectrum, solid points)\nand best-fit model (continuous lines). Lower panel: Ratio between\ndata and the best-fit model values as a function of energy.\nRegions (NLR) placed outside the torus. However, no signifi-\ncant narrow emission lines are visible in the optical spectrum\n(left panel, Fig. 5) taken at the 3.58 m Telescopio Nazionale\nGalileo (TNG). The observed spectrum has been normalized\nto the fraction of the total light which has passed through the\nslit used (1.5\u2032\u2032) under the atmospheric and seeing conditions\n(FWHM \u223c 1\u2032\u2032) during the observations. However the discrep-\nancy between the X-ray properties and the optical spectrum\ncould be only apparent. Indeed, using the approach described\nin Sect. 4.1, we find that an AGN with an intrinsic \u03b1ox < 1.3\nand absorbed by an E B\u2212V = 35 \u00b1 0.1 mag (consistent with the\nmeasured NH \u223c 2 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122), could be completely unde-\ntectable in the observed optical spectrum. Actually, in this case\nno significant emission lines are expected to be detected, as it\nis shown in Fig. 5, right panel. Only hints of [OIII] (EW \u223c 1 \u00c5)\nand H\u03b1+ [NII] (EW \u223c 1 \u00c5) lines are present in the final\nmodel. At the signal-to-noise ratio (S\/N) reached in the ob-\nserved spectrum, these two hints of narrow emission lines are\ncompatible with the intensity of the noise itself and they are not\nclearly detectable. In order to obtain a detection at about 10\u03c3\n488 P. Severgnini et al.: AGN posing as optically normal galaxies\nFig. 4.

Lower panel: Ratio between data and\nthe best-fit model values as a function of energy.\nof these two lines, a S\/N higher than 70 should be reached.\nAn alternative approach is to use a narrower slit in order to\ninclude a smaller fraction of the starlight of the galaxy and\nto make the nuclear emission lines detectable. New imaging\nand spectroscopic observations for this source have been re-\ncently obtained with the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope. In Fig. 6 the\nR-band image of the galaxy obtained with the Subaru Prime\nFocus Camera (Suprime-Cam) is shown. The source looks like\nan early type barred galaxy with a weak nucleus and with a\nMagellanic Cloud like companion galaxy in the North-West\ndirection. The spectroscopic observations, carried out with the\nFaint Object Camera And Spectrograph (FOCAS), has been\nperformed using a 0.8\u2032\u2032 slit under 0.6\u2032\u2032 seeing conditions. The\noptical spectra obtained for the central region (total spectrum)\nand the host galaxy continuum are shown in the upper panel\nof Fig. 7. The host galaxy spectra have been extracted from\nnorth and south of the nuclear region and then normalized to\nthe total spectrum at 5000 \u00c5. Weak emission lines can be seen\nin the total spectrum. When the host galaxy continuum is sub-\ntracted from the total spectrum (Total \u2013 Host, bottom panel),\nSeyfert 2 like emission lines can be clearly seen. This AGN de-\ntection technique (data with an adequate S\/N ratio and a proper\nsubtraction of the underlying starlight continuum) has been al-\nready used by Ho et al. (1995, 1997a,b) to search for Low\nLuminosity AGN. The Subaru data have thus allowed us to un-\nveil the nuclear engine also in the optical band and to set more\nstringent constraints on its intrinsic optical-to-X-ray spectral\nindex: \u03b1ox \u223c 1.2 \u00b1 0.1. In this case, as in the following, the\nerrors relevant on the \u03b1ox(AGN) values take into account the\nuncertainties on both the X-ray and the optical properties. We\nhave estimated the ratio between the observed 2\u201310 keV flux\nand the strength of the [OIII]\u03bb5007 narrow emission line. We\nhave derived a F2\u221210 keV\/F[OIII] of 195 \u00b1 160, which is con-\nsistent with the value expected for Seyfert galaxies (Bassani\net al. 1999). Moreover, this ratio combined with the EW of the\nmeasured Fe emission line (\u223c300 eV) clearly locates this\nsource in the region populated by Compton-thin sources (see\nFig. 1 in Bassani et al. 1999), in agreement with our X-ray best\nfit model.\nIn summary, we conclude that a standard AGN, obscured\nby NH \u223c 2 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 and with an intrinsic 2\u201310 keV lumi-\nnosity of about 5 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121, can be completely misidenti-\nfied using only optical spectroscopic criteria if it is hosted by\nan early-type galaxy of MR <\u223c \u221222 mag (the M\u2217 value for a nor-\nmal galaxy is about \u221221 mag, Brown et al. 2001). In particular,\nthe AGN could be completely overwhelmed by the starlight of\nthe galaxy if it is observed using too wide slits (which include\nmore than 20% of the flux of the galaxy) and\/or with a see-\ning and atmospheric conditions not good enough to reach an\nadequate S\/N. It is worth noting that for more distant galax-\nies (z > 0.4), that typically populate the deep Chandra and\nXMM-Newton surveys, it is almost impossible to get an optical\nspectrum that doesn\u2019t include more than 20% of the flux of the\nhost galaxy by using ground-based telescopes. At the moment,\nthe presence of AGN in object like source #1 found in deep\nX-ray surveys can be unveiled in the optical band only using\ninstrumentations on-board the Hubble Space Telescope.\n4.3. Sources #2 and #3\nSources #2 and #3 are respectively slightly obscured (N H \u223c\n4 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122) and unobscured (NH \u223c 1021 cm\u22122) in the X-ray\ndomain and they should appear in the optical band as inter-\nmediate6 (e.g. Maiolino et al. 2001) and\/or broad line Seyfert\ngalaxies.\nSource #2 is located along the direction of the cluster\nAbell 3112 (\u2206v = 19 068 km s\u22121) and its spectroscopic classifi-\ncation was taken from the \u201cESO Nearby Abell Cluster Survey\u201d\n(ENACS) catalogue (Katgert et al. 1998, see the relevant foot-\nnote of Table 1 for the full web page address). This object was\nclassified as a normal galaxy with no emission lines visible in\nthe (unpublished) optical spectrum. The spectral range covered\nin the rest-frame was from 3940 to 5740 \u00c5.\nA first optical spectrum for source #3 was taken at\nthe 3.58 m TNG Telescope as part of the AXIS project, cov-\nering a spectral rest-frame range from 3200 to 6400 \u00c5. No evi-\ndent emission lines were detected in this source and it was clas-\nsified as an optically normal galaxy on the basis of the available\noptical spectrum.\nFor these two sources (#2 and #3), AGN templates have\nbeen produced using the approach described in Sect. 4.1.\nSince we do not have enough information to normalize the\nAGN+galaxy template to the amount of light included in the\nslit during the observations, we have normalized both templates\nto their R band photometric point. In particular for source #2,\nfor which we do not have in hand the observed optical spec-\ntrum, the type of the host galaxy template has been chosen so\nthat the final composite template would match the photometric\ndata in the B and R bands (Maddox et al. 1990; Katgert et al.\n1998). By assuming an intrinsic \u03b1ox(AGN) < 1.5, we find that,\n6 Seyfert galaxies that have permitted lines with narrow and broad\ncomponents of comparable intensities.\nP.

For this\nreason, the two objects have been re-observed using a wider\nspectral coverage. In particular, source #2 has been re-observed\nwith the 3.6 m ESO telescope (slit of 1.2\u2032\u2032 and a seeing \u223c1.6\u2032\u2032),\nwhile new observations for source #3 have been carried out at\nthe UH 88 inches telescope (slit of 1.6\u2032\u2032 and a seeing \u223c1.5\u2032\u2032).\nIn both spectra an evident H\u03b1 line emerges, unveiling the pres-\nence of an AGN in the optical band. The two new spectra are\nshown in Fig. 8 (black lines). They are normalized on the basis\nof the light included in the slit during the observations. Thanks\nto these new observations and using our model, an estimate\nof \u03b1ox can be obtained: \u03b1ox \u223c 1.2\u00b10.2 and \u03b1ox \u223c 1.25\u00b10.2 for\nsources #2 and #3 respectively. In Fig. 8 the templates obtained\nare overlayed (grey lines) to the observed spectra.\nAlso for these two sources, the F2\u221210 keV\/F[OIII] ratios\n(118 \u00b1 113 and 410 \u00b1 400 for sources #2 and #3 respectively)\nare consistent with the values expected for Seyfert galaxies and\nthe EWFe\u2212K\u03b1 upper limits (EWFe\u2212K\u03b1 < 600 eV for source #2\nand EWFe\u2212K\u03b1 < 250 eV for source #3) indicate that these\nsources are located in the region populated by Compton-thin\nAGN (Bassani et al. 1999), in agreement with the X-ray spec-\ntral analysis presented here.\nOn the basis of the \u03b1ox quoted above, we have estimated\nthe optical magnitudes of the nuclear engine and of the host\ngalaxy: MR(AGN) \u223c \u221218 mag, MR(host) \u223c \u221222.5 mag for\nsource #2 and MR(AGN) \u223c \u221221 mag, MR(host) \u223c \u221222 mag for\nsource #3.\nIt is worth noting that while for objects like source #3 op-\ntical spectroscopy with an appropriate spectral coverage could\neasily allow us to recognize the presence of an AGN, this is\nnot always the case. For instance, in the case of an object like\nsource #2, but at a redshift greater than 0.2, the fraction of\nstarlight included in the slit (e.g. 1.2 \u2032\u2032) is usually large enough\nto overwhelm the strongest lines, including H\u03b1. Using our\ntemplates we have estimated that in such case (z > 0.2) the\nEW(H\u03b1) would be \u22648 \u00c5, i.e. the H\u03b1 line is extremely difficult\nto detect unless a very good S\/N ratio is achieved.\n5. Summary and conclusions\nIn this paper we have presented the X-ray and optical spec-\ntra of 3 XMM-BSS sources selected using the criteria usually\nadopted to define the X-ray Bright Optically Normal Galaxies.\nThe good statistics available for the XMM-Newton data has al-\nlowed us to unambiguously unveil the presence of an AGN in\nall of them. Once more, this result highlights how the X-ray\ndata are the best way of finding AGN even for this kind of\nsources.

The optical\ntemplate (grey solid line), obtained by summing a 5.5 Gyr old early-type galaxy plus a AGN template (black dotted line, \u03b1ox \u223c 1.2, EB\u2212V =\n0.7 mag), is overlayed to the observed spectrum. Right panel: Optical spectrum of XMM J075117.9+180856.1 (source #3) taken at the UH\n88 inch telescope. The grey solid line represents the optical template obtained by summing a 5.5 Gyr old early-type galaxy with an AGN\ntemplate (black dotted line, \u03b1ox \u223c 1.25, EB\u2212V = 0.2 mag). Only the strongest emission lines present in a typical AGN spectrum are labeled.\na range of luminosities from 1042 to 1043 erg s\u22121, are hosted in\nthese sources. No Compton-thick objects have been found.\nUsing the X-ray properties derived for each of the\n3 sources, a simple model (developed in order to investigate\nthe apparent lack of optical emission lines) and new optical ob-\nservations, we find that:\n\u2013 the AGN considered here are standard AGN hosted by\ngalaxies with a magnitude MR brighter than M\u2217;\n\u2013 X-ray obscured AGN with an intrinsic L2\u221210 keV \u223c 5 \u00d7\n1042 erg s\u22121 could be hidden in the optical band if they are\nhosted by a galaxy brighter than MR \u2264 \u221222 mag;\n\u2013 up to z \u223c 0.2 slightly X-ray obscured AGN of L2\u221210 keV \u223c\n9 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 could be partially overwhelmed by a host\ngalaxy with MR \u2264 \u221222.5 mag. The sampling of the H\u03b1 re-\ngion should allow the AGN detection in the optical band.\nFor z > 0.2 also the H\u03b1 line could be overwhelmed by the\nP. Severgnini et al.: AGN posing as optically normal galaxies 491\ngalaxy continuum using ground-based telescope observa-\ntions;\n\u2013 X-ray unabsorbed AGN of L2\u221210 keV \u223c 3 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121\ncould be optically hidden if they are hosted by a galaxy\nwith MR \u2264 \u221222 mag and if the spectral coverage doesn\u2019t\ninclude the H\u03b1 line.\nIn summary, we find that the X-ray and optical properties of\nthe sources studied here do not require a non-standard AGN.\nThe lack of significant emission lines in the optical spectra\ncould be explained by an adequate combination of the absorp-\ntion associated to the AGN, of the optical faintness of this lat-\nter with respect to the host galaxy and of an inadequate set-up\nand atmospheric conditions during the spectroscopic observa-\ntions. In particular, the results reported here clearly show that\nin some cases a non appropriate wavelength coverage of the\noptical spectrum could be the cause of a misclassification, as\nan optically normal galaxy, of an X-ray source which is truly\nan AGN. A similar result was recently presented by Moran\net al. (2002) using a sample of nearby Seyfert 2 galaxies. In\nthis respect, it is worth noting that from the X-ray deep surveys\nperformed with Chandra (Barger et al. 2001a, 2001b, 2002;\nHornschemeier 2001) about 40\u201360% of the identified sources\nare optically classified as galaxies and for \u223c70% of them the\nobserved range does not include the H\u03b1 line. Our results, thus,\nremark the importance of being really careful in the optical\nidentification of faint X-ray sources for which no good optical\nspectra are available. Moreover, even if the most likely expla-\nnation for the nature of XBONG galaxies proposed by differ-\nent groups working on deeper surveys (e.g. Barger et al. 2002;\nComastri et al. 2002a,b, 2003) is the presence of heavily ob-\nscured AGN, our results suggest that XBONG galaxies could\nharbor X-ray unobscured AGN as well. Observational evidence\nsupporting this last suggestion has already been presented from\ndeep surveys by Page et al. (2003).\nAcknowledgements. We are grateful to M. Elvis and M. J.
