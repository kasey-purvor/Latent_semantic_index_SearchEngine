Thus a\ncontemporary reading of Charles Dickens\u2019s David Copperfield (1850)\nwill place the novel within the cultural politics of the early Victorian\nperiod, its determinations of class and gender, the history of publishing,\nchanging make-ups of readership etc. Yet culture itself has a context\n\u2013 the biosphere, air, water, plant and animal life \u2013 and the more\nradical work in environmental criticism tends to be, so to speak, \u2018meta-\ncontextual.\u2019 That is, it opens on issues that may involve perspectives\nfor which given practices of mapping out the cultural politics of a text\nseem limited and enclosed, questions which may involve time-spans\nof centuries or millennia, that do not fit given political categories of\nleft and right and which may concern injustice to those not yet born.\nThe ethical challenge of non-human lives adds itself to this list. The\nterm meta-contextual also seems worth coining here to embrace one of\nthe most exciting but also inherently problematic and unstable features\nof environmental criticism: that it must in some way, implicitly or\notherwise, engage itself with an issue so huge as the overall stance\nhumanity should take in relation to the rest of the natural world.\nAn increasing attention to the ethical and socio-political questions\nposed by the human treatment of animals is part of what is\nnow perceived as a general environmental crisis. Derrida observed\nin For What Tomorrow (2004) that \u2018A large-scale disorganization-\nreorganisation of the human earth is under way.\u20191 He might have\nomitted \u2018human.\u2019 In fact, awareness of other issues, such a carbon\nemissions, has been intensifying so fast that even a recently dead\nthinker who spent so much time flying across the world to conferences\nbegins to look changed. If even the more conservative forecasts of\nclimate change are accurate, it could be that, just as the name \u2018Martin\n18 Oxford Literary Review\nHeidegger\u2019 immediately and unjustly conjures the word \u2018Nazi,\u2019 Derrida\nwill sometimes need to be defended as the thinker of \u2018incalculable\nresponsibility\u2019 who was yet associated with more pollution than any\nother philosopher in history.2\nNevertheless, the meta-contextual questions posed by the\nenvironmental crisis itself entail, crudely speaking, an active\n\u2018deconstruction\u2019 of many fundamental philosophical, juridical and\nethical concepts on which the West is based, and hence to a large\ndegree the globalised world. Much of this means, as any reader of Of\nGramamtology3 will know, not the collapse of old ways of thinking\nand practice in the wake of new ones, but a general and perplexing\nsense of the closure and finitude of inherited forms, akin at times to\nparalysis. While it seems to be clearer all the time that \u2018It is as if Western\nsociety has deliberately set out to destroy the integrity of the ecosystem\u2019\n(Robert J. Brulle),4 the conceptual, legal, economic, social and political\nbases of such destruction remain almost impossible to escape, budge or\nsometimes even perceive. Tell many people that you are working on an\narticle about animals and they will smile slightly, as if they wanted to\ngive you a pat on the head.\nCritical thought about the human\/animal borderline must be\nimmediately meta-contextual. However, this challenge is frequently\nunmanageable and seems often to be resisted, either consciously\nor unconsciously. For instance, if there were as straightforward an\nanalogy as some claim between human rights and putative animal\nrights then one might expect there to be numerous literary readings\nequivalent to common schools of interpretation elsewhere, viz. we\nwould have readings of classical texts highlighting in them elements\nof prejudice or of the systematic misrepresentation of animal life.\nA demystification of the civilised sphere would take the form of\ndemonstrating its basis in modes of food production requiring mass\nservitude, imprisonment and slaughter. There would be widespread\narguments that \u2018the canon\u2019 itself needs to be overhauled in view of\nits systematic endorsement of pastoral, hunting and religious practices\nimplicated in animal suffering. There would be a broad questioning of\nthe general association of animals with \u2018mere\u2019 children\u2019s books, leading\nperhaps to new evaluations of books such as Henry Williamson\u2019s Tarka\nthe Otter (1927) or Jack London\u2019s The Call of the Wild (1903). Might\nnot even Norman Maclean\u2019s A River Runs Through It (1976) find itself\nTimothy Clark 19\nre-categorised as an instance of \u2018speciesism\u2019 together with subgenres of\nwriting on hunting and fishing?\nHowever, apart from a few essays in scattered places, no literary\nmovement with such modes of reading exists.5 Even the Ecocriticism\nReader of 1996, a landmark for the emerging school of \u2018ecocrticism,\u2019\ncontained not one essay devoted to the issue of an animal or animals.\nWhy is engaging with animals so difficult?\nThe work of Cary Wolfe stands out here for putting to detailed\nwork an understanding of the animal\/human distinction that draws\non Derrida\u2019s depth of questioning.6 Wolfe\u2019s sophistication lies mainly\nin the engagement with the \u2018speciesist\u2019 assumptions at work in the\ndepth structure of even the most \u2018progressive\u2019 critical methodologies.\nHowever, if the issue becomes instead one of simply tracing the work of\nthe human\/animal divide in a primary text, the critical work involved\ncan seem less demanding. For instance, one can take a canonical text\nin which animal concerns seem at first to play no part at all, say\nDavid Copperfield once more, and then trace in it the fault lines of the\nanimal\/human distinction. In this case we might move from consid-\neration of the lap dog \u2018Jip\u2019 who serves as a kind of double to David\u2019s\ndecoratively genteel first wife, Dora (dog and mistress even dying at the\nsame time), or his aunt Betsey\u2019s phobia of donkeys (and men), and the\nubiquity of horses and animal imagery and metaphors. Once removed\nfrom its customary blind spot, the place of animals in the work of\nhuman self-imaging, representation and work becomes peculiarly\nand even disturbingly obvious. However, as David Wood observes,\n\u2018Once we have seen through our self-serving, anthropocentric thinking\nabout other animals, we are and should be left disarmed, ill-equipped\nto calculate our proper response.\u20197 For instance a literary critic can\nsay \u2018What would War and Peace be without horses?\u2019 \u2013 but then\nwhat?\n\u2018. . . keep travelling for grass.\u2019\nThe issue of animals poses imponderable questions on the unstable\nborder between \u2018the contextual,\u2019 treating animals entirely as facets\nof human culture (e.g studying different attitudes to the horse in\ndifferent places and times) and \u2018the meta-contextual,\u2019 such as attempts\nto consider the animal \u2018in its own right.\u2019 To makes these issues more\nlegible, and to give a sense of their immense stakes, I would like to\n20 Oxford Literary Review\noffer an experimental reading of the Australian Henry Lawson\u2019s famous\nshort story \u2018TellingMrs Baker\u2019 ?8 This was first published in Blackwood\u2019s\nMagazine for October1901, during Lawson\u2019s brief stay in England.\n1901 also happens to be the year of \u2018federation,\u2019 that is the year in\nwhich the separate British colonies came together to form the country\nstill called \u2018The Commonwealth of Australia.\u2019\n\u2018Telling Mrs Baker\u2019 is the story of two drovers who return to lie to\none Mrs Baker about the supposedly brave and noble death by fever\nof her husband, Bob Baker, nicknamed \u2018the Boss,\u2019 droving cattle across\nthe Australian bush \u2013 he actually died from alcohol poisoning. Baker\u2019s\ndeath is grotesque and sordid (at one point he strips naked in despair\nto try to hang himself in the scrub) and his posthumous effects expose\nhim as a sexual predator on the wives of friends. Nevertheless, his two\nmates, Andy M\u2019Culloch and the narrator, believe that \u2018it isn\u2019t Bush\nreligion to desert a mate in a hole\u2019 (p. 198). Having stuck with Baker\nin life, they now contrive to tell a massive and exonerating lie about\nhis death to Mrs Baker when they return to the small town of Solong,\ntowards Sydney. This confrontation of the sexes makes up most of the\nnarrative.\nMy reading experiment falls into two parts, the first approaching the\ntext with the tools of a relatively familiar kind of contextual reading,\nthe second trying to engage with how the issues of nonhuman ethics\nforce one to go beyond that.\n(A) An environmental hatred marks \u2018Telling Mrs Baker\u2019 and many\nof Lawson\u2019s stories about \u2018the Out Back Hell\u2019 that helps Bob Baker\ndestroy himself. The Bush and the Outback seem to deride any given\nassociations of \u2018nature.\u2019 Lawson\u2019s sketch-story \u2018Hungerford\u2019 mocks that\ngenre of travel journalism that depicts the scenery and amenities of a\ndestination with a view to enticing the reader to visit it. Lawson turns\nthe genre on its head to detail all the reasons not to visit Hungerford,\nNew South Wales.9 Lawson\u2019s nightmare images help legitimate what\nwas almost universally felt to be the duty of colonial society to redeem\nthe land by making it fit for various forms of agriculture and settlement:\nSomebody told me that the country was very dry on the\nother side of Nevertire. It is. I wouldn\u2019t like to sit down on\nit anywhere. The least horrible spot in the bush, in a dry\nTimothy Clark 21\nseason, is where the bush isn\u2019t \u2013 where it has been cleared\naway and a green crop is trying to grow.10\nLawson shows little effort to grasp the specific ecology of these places,\nseeing mostly similarities between wild Australia and landscapes that\nhave been ruined by human waste or mistreatment. Australian nature\nis not \u2018natural\u2019 in any recognisable sense but a kind of waste dump: \u2018We\ncrossed the Macquarrie \u2013 a narrow, muddy gutter with a dog swimming\nacross, and three goats interested\u2019 ;11 \u2018The country looks as though\na great ash-heap had been spread out there, and mulga scrub and\nfirewood planted \u2013 and neglected.\u201912 One story indulges the geological\nfiction that the very rock is rotting.13\nSuch a land seems good only for changing into something more\nrecognisably European, pastoral, pretty and profitable. In Lawson the\ndenigration of the Australian environment and exaggerations of its\n\u2018weirdness\u2019 became part of an idealization of the shearers and settlers\nthat faced such realities, the new supposedly (masculine) Australian\ntypes, stoical, loyal, egalitarian (at least with fellow Europeans), taciturn\nand even sardonic, resourceful, tough. The form that such cultural\nnationalism took may be marked by the contingency that the 1890s\nwere both a time of drought and of economic depression.\nBob Baker is introduced at the opening of the story as a former\n\u2018squatter,\u201914 or landowner, in the business of keeping sheep and\nbreeding race horses. However, he fell into ruin by spending too much\ntime in Sydney in \u2018swell hotels\u2019 (p. 196), following up the horse racing\nside of his interests. \u2018So after a pretty severe drought, when the sheep\ndied by the thousands on his runs, Bob Baker went under, and the\nbank took over his station and put a manager in charge\u2019 (p. 196). He\nseems to take to excess drinking when he becomes a drover (p. 197),\nand maybe even \u2018hadn\u2019t been quite right in his head before he started\ndrinking \u2013 he had acted queer sometimes . . .maybe he\u2019d got a touch of\nsunstroke or got brooding over his troubles\u2019 (p. 198).\nBaker\u2019s new job, joined by Andy M\u2019Culloch and the narrator, does\nnot seem to be routine cattle droving. It is an unspecified long-distance\nenterprise that will need two years in all, travelling inland and north\nwest for over 1,500 miles towards \u2018new country round by the Gulf of\nCarpentaria with a big mob of cattle\u2019 (p. 196, emphasis added). This\nreads like the use of the cattle mob to open up the continent, either\n22 Oxford Literary Review\nto enlarge already existing runs or to try to establish new pastoral\nbusinesses in Northern Queensland. This would put Baker and his\nfriends within a recognised \u2018pioneering\u2019 tradition. Eric Rolls writes: \u2018So\nmany Australian explorers went, or were sent, chasing rainbows: inland\nseas or good stock routes where there was only desert.\u201915\nGraham Huggan\u2019s Australian Literature: Postcolonialism, Racism,\nTransnationalism (2007) offers a new overview of Lawson\u2019s career.16\nHuggan tries to rescue Lawson from his dubious status as a (white)\nnationalist Australian icon by stressing modern readings that \u2018focus on\nracial exclusionism, spurious appeals to solidarity, and a sexual division\nof labour that highlights the vanities and insufficiencies of men\u2019 (p. 56).\nAll three points immediately suggest a reading of \u2018Telling Mrs Baker.\u2019\nLawson\u2019s work is thus recuperated in a qualified way through being\nretrospectively gauged against modern notions of equity:\nWhile it would be optimistic, to say the least, to convert\nLawson into a surreptitious champion for Aborigines, stories\nlike \u2018The Bush Undertaker\u2019 suggest that he was certainly\naware, like most of his contemporaries, of the racialized\nanxieties underlying white-settler claims upon the land they\nselected for their own. (p. 58)\n\u2018Telling Mrs Baker,\u2019 however, is more explicitly about the\n\u2018constructions\u2019 of gender that the colonial situation sets up. The\ndomestic Mrs Baker, \u2018with nothing particular about her in the way\nof brains\u2019 (pp. 202-3), is lied to in ways that help her sustain a self-\nimage as the loving wife of a brave man who heroically succumbed to\nthe perils of the frontier. She also consents to her husband\u2019s invented\n\u2018last wish\u2019 (p. 201) that she return to Sydney. That city appears here as\nthe place of domestic security and illusion, of a willing ignorance about\nthe real hardships of the land on which it depends. An earlier passage\nin the story has the narrator mock his presumed urban readership \u2013\n\u2018Sounds queer to you city people don\u2019t it?\u2019 (p. 199).\nLike the famous lie to the intended that ends Joseph Conrad\u2019s\ncontemporary novella, Heart of Darkness (1899), the lie to Mrs Baker\ndoes more than cast her in a protected and patronised feminine role.\nHer being kept in that role also helps sustain the lie of the man\u2019s\nheroism and self-sacrifice. Whereas Conrad\u2019s Kurtz seems to succumb\nTimothy Clark 23\nto what is controversially depicted as the barbarism of indigenous\nAfricans, Baker\u2019s antagonist was the Australian environment, its\ndroughts and emptiness, and his own lack of the strength of character\nto resist it, a strength, however that Lawson is quick to attribute to\nother men, such as the two mates.\nAny comparison with the end of Heart of Darkness is complicated\nby a kind of doubling. Bob Baker has a brother, Ned, and Mrs Baker\na sister, a Miss Standish from Sydney (no first names are given for the\nwomen). Both siblings are counterparts. Ned Baker is like his brother\nin being the victim of an environment that refuses to support for long\nhis particular mode of exploiting it. He is \u2018fighting the drought, the\nrabbit-pest, and the banks, on a small [sheep] station back on the\n[New South Wales\/Queensland] border\u2019 (p. 198), set in hopeless \u2018God-\nforsaken scrubs\u2019 (p. 199). But Ned Baker is also unlike his alcoholic\nbrother in being reliable, honourable and hard-working. He helps clear\nup the mess of his brother\u2019s death, avenging himself on a publican who\nexploited Bob\u2019s infatuation with a girl employed in his pub to lure\nmen to buy her drinks. Miss Standish is a counterpart to Mrs Baker.\nWhereas Mrs Baker seems happy to be stupid, Miss Standish is pictured\nas intelligent, a good looking young woman, dressed in a city style. She\nalso writes short stories for the Sydney Bulletin. Miss Standish soon sees\nthrough the lie being told her sister and has to be silenced by a carefully\naimed wink. Later she follows the men as they leave, thanks them and\nkisses them warmly on the mouth.\n\u2018Telling Mrs Baker\u2019 pivots around a dichotomy between those who\nknow the truth but require others who need to be lied to and those who\nneed to be lied to, Mrs Baker, city people on the whole. Miss Standish\nseems set to write for the Sydney Bulletin along the already rather trite\nlines of \u2018I like the Bushmen! They are grand men \u2013 they are noble\u2019\n(p. 208), an odd thing to say given what she knows about her brother-\nin-law. It certainly seems a double-edged compliment to the Bulletin,\nthe journal with which Lawson was most associated, especially in a\nstory published in the year 1901.\nA loosely eco-feminist of reading of \u2018Telling Mrs Baker\u2019 might\nfocus on the way an environmentally destructive colonial situation\nboth perpetuates and depends on certain gender roles. Lawson could\nthen be said to demonstrate the contingency or constructed nature of\nthose roles, highlighting what might now be seen as the demeaning\n24 Oxford Literary Review\ncost of the whole enterprise. In dying in the bush Baker anticipates\nthe series of white male pioneer figures in Australian literature whose\ndeath somehow sanctifies and appropriates the land \u2013 except that\nhere, ambivalently, it is only the idealistic loyalty with which that myth\nis maintained as an known fiction that seems to justify it. At the same\ntime, by perpetuating their mutually supporting lies, both the two\nmates and Miss Standish can also be said to evade the environmental\nissues that the story must raise. If Miss Standish\u2019s readership in the\nSydney Bulletin will feel inclined to admire the loyalty and endurance\nof the Bushmen, her kissing them at the end of Lawson\u2019s text also seems\nan evasion and eclipse of what had after all been the tale of one man\u2019s\nsordid defeat in farming practices that seem at odds with the actual\nlandscape and climate. Australian if not British readers of \u2018Telling Mrs\nBaker\u2019 in 1901 would have recognised in the reference to the Bulletin a\nleading organ of the Australian cultural nationalism of the 1890s, one\nthat helped set up a (masculinist) image of the \u2018Australian\u2019 as defined\nand distinguished by a relationship to the Bush, with many of the\nselective egalitarian values associated with Lawson himself.17\n(B) How far does this take us? So far this reading has been within\nfamiliar critical parameters. It has taken the human cultural sphere as its\nobject and studied it as a field of power relations that pose various kinds\nof identity in various ways, in this case in terms of gender stereotypes\nthat help legitimate the brutal colonization and settlement of Australia.\nSo far the environment itself, and any non-human animals, have been\nconsidered only as adjuncts of the human story, like the thousands of\nsheep that helped ruin Baker\u2019s livelihood by dying of thirst. This has\nall been a matter of cultural political contexts, but not of the meta-\ncontextual as defined earlier.\nA first complication or refinement of this reading, then, might\nconcern some of the stakes of the notion of the human and human\nidentity implicit in the text, emulating Cary Wolfe\u2019s attention to\na pervading speciesism. Wolfe follows Derrida in finding some\nadvocates of animal \u2018rights\u2019 problematic because such \u2018rights\u2019 already\nrest on a specific understanding of the human which is heavily\ncompromised and already deeply implicated in modes of exploitation.18\nIt remains a limitation even of many ecocritical essays concerned with\nenvironmental justice that they still rest on the assumptions of a liberal\njustice model that takes human agents as the sole concern, granting\nTimothy Clark 25\nvalue to the non-human only derivatively . Secondly, that human \u2018right\u2019\nis understood on the model of a utility- and power-maximizing rational\nindividual, and justice as a matter of the adjudication of competing\nareas of self-interest, and of the equitable allocation of limited natural\nresources or assets, such as animals. Derrida writes of the absurdity\nof applying such a concept to non-human creatures: \u2018to confer or\nto recognize rights for \u201canimals\u201d is a surreptitious or implicit way of\nconfirming a certain interpretation of the human subject, which itself\nwill have been the very lever of the worst violence carried out against\nnonhuman living beings.\u201919 So an eco-feminist reading of \u2018Telling Mrs\nBaker\u2019 would want to consider how far its issues would be compromised\nby any argument that confined itself to protesting the way women were\nexcluded from full entry into such a model of personhood. Secondly,\nif environmental justice is only defined as \u2018the right of all people to\nshare equally in the benefits bestowed by a healthy environment\u201920\nthen the ethical challenge of non-human animals, as putative victims\nof such people\u2019s \u2018rights,\u2019 must also reassert the exciting but unstable\nmeta-contextual element of environmentalist thinking.\nA more meta-contextual reading of \u2018Telling Mrs Baker\u2019 might test\nthe implications of the fact that human beings have always existed as\npart of a community of animals. Human beings could not exist and\ncannot be understood without other species, whatever the tendency\nof modern societies to keep livestock hidden away in factory-like\nenclosures while people yet live as if red meat were on tap, like water\nfrom a reservoir. Modern Australian history is legibly not just a history\nof human beings. Many of its victims, and some of its winners, are\nnon-human. The European settlement was a matter of the partial but\noften extensively destructive supplanting of one biota by another, partly\nby human intent, as with wheat crops and cattle, but often without\nit, as with infestations of rabbits and cane toads. Not in any country,\nbut perhaps least of all Australia, should one continue to write history\nas if it were a matter of human agency alone. It would like trying to\nunderstand the cuckoo without making reference to other birds.\nNo indigenous animals appear in \u2018Telling Mrs Baker.\u2019 All the\nanimals named are introductions, sheep, rabbits, horses, cattle, dogs.\nNo aboriginal people appear either. The invisibility of indigenous\nlife is appropriate in its sinister way. The defeat of the Aborigines\nwas to a significant degree owing to the least visible members of\n26 Oxford Literary Review\nthe European biota, viruses and bacteria, including some ultimately\nderived from domesticated animals. Europeans arrived on the shore of\nAustralia, as they did North America, in ships stacked with livestock\nand after centuries of living with domestic animals and birds, sharing\nboth their diseases and immunities. In effect settlers and their animals\nformed a kind of social unit, one whose members were to a degree\nmutually intelligible through each other\u2019s signals. Wherever the cattle\nran, even over wide areas, they brought with them the jurisdiction of\ntheir human owners. Deborah Bird Rose even suggests: \u2018the conquest of\nAustralia did not begin in 1788. It began about 10,000 years ago when\nour ancestors domesticated cattle.\u201921 British settlers and transported\nconvicts arrived on the shore of a continent inhabited by hunter gathers\nwith little or no resistance even to chickenpox or other \u2018minor\u2019 ailments.\nThe stoicism and toughness of some of Lawson\u2019s figures is undercut by\nthe way in which the European conquest of much of the world was to\na large degree an accident of European microlife.\nThis meta-contextual dimension is missing from such modern\nstudies as Huggan\u2019s Australian Literature (2007) or the collection\nUnsettling Settler Societies: Articulations of Gender, Race, Ethnicity and\nClass (1995).22 In meeting this lacuna an indispensable resource\nis Alfred W. Crosby\u2019s frightening book Ecological Imperialism: The\nBiological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (1986).23 Crosby studies the\nlarge, mainly acultural and meaninglessly biological forces behind the\nextraordinary fact that it was people of European descent who came\nto inhabit and dominate large areas of the earth, especially most of\nthe temperate zones. This suggests an over-view that places Lawson\u2019s\nstory in a global context of colonial ecocide. Crosby also presents his\nreaders with the challenge that these \u2018Neo-Europes\u2019 are now responsible\nfor a large proportion of the world\u2019s food production, in both grain\nand meat. \u2018The regions that today export more foodstuffs of European\nprovenance \u2013 grains and meats \u2013 than any other lands on earth had no\nwheat, barley, rye, cattle, pigs, sheep, or goats whatsoever five hundred\nyears ago\u2019 (p. 7).\nConsideration of animals makes it seem problematic to see the\nculture of 1901 Australia solely in terms of the post-Foucauldian notion\nof discourse used in Huggan\u2019s Australian Literature, that is \u2018the sum\nof \u201cavailable ways of speaking [and] writing in which social power\noperates to produce certain objects and effects\u201d (Susan Sheridan).\u201924\nTimothy Clark 27\nThis is an overly anthropocentric methodology that gives a curtailed\nview of something that was actually matter of numerous species and the\naccidents of their interaction. The catastrophe of the rabbit infestation\ndemonstrates just how far the role of people \u2018was less a matter of\njudgement and choice than of being downstream of a bursting dam\u2019\n(Crosby p. 192). Critics need to find ways of describing animals and\nnatural features as themselves agents, rather than as passive functions\nof some moulding social discourse, \u2018constructed\u2019 as they like to say \u2013 as\nif any human culture could ever really form an enormous construction\nsite in that self-contained way.\nA further reading of Lawson\u2019s story might pivot upon the following\npassage, which it is perhaps easy to skim over in the exclusively human\ninterest of tracing the decline of the Boss and the reaction of his mates:\nWe had two other men with us, but had the devil\u2019s own\nbother on account of the cattle. It was a mixed-up job all-\nround. You see it was all big runs round there, and we had\nto keep the bullocks moving along the route all the time, or\nelse get into trouble for trespass. The agent wasn\u2019t going to\ngo to the expense of putting the cattle in a paddock until\nthe Boss sobered up; there was very little grass on the route\nor the travelling-stock reserves or camps, so we had to keep\ntravelling for grass. (p. 197)\nWhat Lawson does not write is that in passing across and obliterating\nnumerous boundaries of the traditional inhabitants, such high-pressure\npastoralism also drove out many native animals as it displaced or\ndestroyed Aboriginal societies. Ecological disaster became the chief\nagent of rapid colonization and conquest. Even the native grasses were\nlost. Eric Rolls writes of the first years of the British colony:\nThe only things not thriving in the Colony were Australian\ngrasses. Their roots had run in a spongy soil full of humus.\nThey were accustomed to fire, to drought, and flood, to\ndeficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus, to the gentle feeding\nof sharp-toothed kangaroos at the clumped butts, and the\npicking of their seeds of parrots and pigeons and rats. They\nhad never had their whole seed heads snatched in one\n28 Oxford Literary Review\nmouthful; they had never been trampled by cloven hooves;\ntheir surface roots had never had to run in hard ground.25\nThe very weeds were introductions, like dandelions, or like \u2018plantain,\nthe Englishman\u2019s foot.\u201926\nDerrida envisages a massive shift in the way human beings engage\nwith the non-human and the challenge of understanding differently the\n\u2018history of law and of the concept of right.\u201927 This must be especially\nintractable in the case of nation-states like Australia, founded for a large\npart on the basis of the eradication of indigenous biota for the benefit\nof the narrow, fragile eco-system of an originally European agriculture.\nWith early Twenty-First Century Australia now suffering under a long,\nunprecedented and sometimes catastrophic drought, with increasing\ncalls for modes of agriculture there less at odds with its natural\ncontext,28 Lawson becomes newly fascinating not as an Australian\nicon but as a writer of environmental conflict and degradation. His\ncharacters already live in what Ulrich Beck calls \u2018the age of unintended\nconsequences.\u201929\nOne possible way in which the contemporary rereading of Lawson\nmight work is through the arguments of the bioregionalism movement.\nAssociated with Kirkpatrick Sale, Gary Snyder and Jim Dodge,30 this\nadvocates modes of life, work and thought geared sensitively and for the\nlong term to natural bio-regions, as opposed to modes of life forcibly\ndefined within the often arbitrary or violently imposed boundaries of\nthe modern nation state, with its associated and often over-centralized\nimposition of agricultural practices geared only to short term profit.\nWhereas older generations took for granted a basic fluency in the flora\nand fauna of their place \u2013 \u2018what is taught by plants and weather\u201931 \u2013\n\u2018[m]any contemporary Americans,\u2019 Snyder writes, \u2018don\u2019t even know\nthat they don\u2019t \u201cknow the plants\u201d.\u201932 Seen in terms of the long-term\nchances for such a society to survive, such loss of local knowledge begins\nto look disastrous: \u2018The United States, Canada, Mexico, are passing\npolitical entities; they have their legitimacies, to be sure, but they\nwill lose their mandate if they continue to abuse the land.\u201933 In effect\nbio-regional readings and practices, sensitive to issues concerning local\nfauna and flora, can form an intelligent subversion of the institutions\nand economics of the modern nation state. They also, I suggest,\nreturning to the Australian example, can induce revised readings of the\nTimothy Clark 29\nsocial, cultural and identity politics which such a nation state induces\nand sustains.\nA bioregional focus can also undo what has been called the\n\u2018methodological nationalism\u201934 of dominant ways of reading cultures\nand texts, i.e readings that take the exclusively human society defined\nby the boundaries of a nation state as its sole stage, and which\nwill study David Copperfield or \u2018Telling Mrs Baker\u2019 solely within the\nterms of the emerging and conflicting identities and human interests\nwith that national culture\u2019s development and vicissitudes. In Lawson\u2019s\ncase, implicit ways of being \u2018Australian\u2019 are given a double-edged\ncelebration in their very vulnerability, while dubious models of gender\nare posed within the framework of nation-building. Against this,\nSnyder\u2019s ascription of agency to the non-human (to \u2018what is taught\nby plants and weather\u2019 (p. 41)) may serve to underline the narrowness\nof any critical method that reads \u2018Telling Mrs Baker\u2019 solely in terms of\ncategories of the social construction of identity. This short story could\nin fact be described as explicitly dramatising a lie that seeks to contain\nall the action it depicts to the stage of an culturally bounded human\nidentity politics.\nAs Australia becomes \u2018arguably the first developed nation to feel the\nimpact of climate change at a visceral level,\u201935 its current \u2018millennium\ndrought\u2019 alters, in a long term perspective, the significance of Lawson\u2019s\nwork from out of the \u2018federation drought\u2019 (1895-1902). As a text of\nlies and environmental degradation published in the year of Australia\u2019s\nfederation, \u2018Telling Mrs Baker\u2019 already fulfils Beck\u2019s sense that the\nenvironmental crisis will erode both the bases and legitimacy of the\nmodern nation state.\nThe crisis also patently disregards and effectively deconstructs the\ndistinction of animal and human. A farmer like Ned Baker, trying\nto survive on a farm devastated by lack of water and by rabbits his\nown society introduced, is a figure for whom Beck\u2019s \u2018the risk society\u2019 is\nalready a valid term. Beck shows how the demands of \u2018environmental\njustice\u2019 metamorphose in such a society in drastic, unprecedented ways\nincompatible with the modern state\u2019s administration of distributive\njustice. Modern environmental risks \u2013 with CO2 emissions, radiation,\nGM plants, particulates, desertification, etc. \u2013 all exceed the normal\noperation of established systems of insurance or of possible litigation\nfor damages, systems capable only of dealing with calculable and\n30 Oxford Literary Review\nquantifiable risks to a specific and limited number of people (it cannot\nfor instance cover the majority of the victims of the Chernobyl disaster,\nfor they are yet to be born). The current state of the world seems\nequivalent to that of elements of pastoral Australia Lawson struggled\nto see, an intensifying agricultural\/industrial accident, one whose exact\nconsequences cannot be gauged, for which insurance is meaningless\nand which touches all living things in some way or another. Beck writes:\nIn terms of social politics . . . the ecological crisis involves a\nsystematic violation of basic rights, a crisis of basic rights,\nwhose long-term effect in weakening society can scarcely\nbe underestimated. For dangers are being produced by\nindustry, externalised by economics, individualized by the\nlegal system, legitimised by the natural sciences and made\nto appear harmless by politics. That this is breaking down\nthe power and credibility of institutions only becomes clear\nwhen the system is put on the spot, as Greenpeace, for\nexample, has tried to do.36\nUltimately, the human population of Australia will as eligible for\n\u2018compensation\u2019 for long term climate change as a dead sheep. A massive\nand fatal discrepancy opens up between the norms of law (\u2018human\nrights\u2019), government and economics and the realities over which they\nrule, a world in which all people may increasingly come to share the\nvulnerability of non-human animals. Bob Baker may not be the first\nto drink himself to death in an arid land unable to sustain for long his\nkind of farming. \u2018Sounds queer to you city people don\u2019t it?\u2019 (p. 199).\nA New International?\nDerrida advocated a \u2018new international\u2019 between the human and the\nliving more generally.37 Perhaps this is not hard to describe in the\nabstract at least. If \u2018justice\u2019 is said to be the undeconstructible horizon of\ndeconstruction, that in the \u2018name of \u2019 which one thinks and works, then\nthe claim of the non-human to ethical attention obviously demands\na continuous reconsideration and revision of given law. Talking, as it\nhappened, in Australia, Derrida advocated in 1999 that that part of the\nidea of justice he calls \u2018unconditional hospitality\u2019 be extended beyond\nTimothy Clark 31\nthe human.38 What this actually means in practice, though, is far more\ndifficult to envisage.\nSome points can at least be made about aporias in current thinking\nand practice, focusing the dubious ways in which the putative science\nof \u2018ecology\u2019 functions in environmental writing and in culture more\ngenerally as a source of moral guidance.\nReferences to \u2018ecology\u2019 in the spheres of resource and environmental\nmanagement often use its assumed status as science to mask major\npolitical and social decisions: assumptions about \u2018what we value\u2019\nare both expressed and \u2018obscured by the language of biological\nconservation\u2019 (Matthew Oates).39 Such decisions come to the surface\nas soon as one starts to analyse efforts in modern Australia to\nrestore indigenous eco-systems and eradicate or at least control such\nintroductions as foxes or the feral cat. Such programmes usually take\n1788, the first date of European settlement, as kind of benchmark for\nrestoration. Adrian Franklin writes:\nthe orthodoxy in Australia holds that native animals are\nthose that were here at the time of the white settlement.\nHowever, this traps environmental action in the enigma\nof an eco-system they can never aspire to restore: the\nextensively burned pre-colonial landscape of Aboriginal\nAustralia, or indeed the dominance of acacias on the\ncontinent before they were displaced by eucalypts. By this\nlogic the dingo that came before the whites visited Australia\nis a native animal but the brumby [a local breed of horse\ngone feral] is not because it came just after.40\nEnvironmental culture often appropriates \u2018ecology\u2019 to rather tired\nromantic arguments along the lines of \u2018human nature\u2019 refinding\nits essence through a renewed contact with \u2018nature,\u2019 overcoming\nsupposedly alienating dualisms of mind and body, consciousness and\nobject etc. But, as Franklin\u2019s point shows, what that \u2018nature\u2019 actually is\nis harder to gauge.\nReferences to \u2018ecology\u2019 also function lazily as a kind of eco-moralism.\nIn literary and cultural criticism this turns many readings into kinds\nof allegory of human transgression, as in Keith Tester\u2019s statement: \u2018So\nlong as we civilized men imagine ourselves to be apart from the land,\n32 Oxford Literary Review\nand from our fellow creatures, we shall attempt to exploit them for\nour private gain, and the attempt will kill us.\u201941 \u2018Telling Mrs Baker\u2019\nwould read in such a framework as an implicit green parable, one\nthat reasserted a norm of human re-integration into the natural world.\nReferences to the truths of \u2018ecology\u2019 may be often a hidden desire for a\nkind of providence.\nEcological restoration programmes are often a valuable response\nto the devastation wrought by settlement, as must be calls for\nmore suitable kinds of farming practice and water use coming from\ncampaigners such as Michael Archer and Bob Beale.42 However, they\ncan also indulge an unacknowledged and problematic kind of eco-\nnationalism or even eco-cleansing (indigenous = good, introduced\n= bad), a policy dubious in itself for its dogmatism and with\nuncomfortable overtones in a country often torn by debates about\nhuman immigration. Franklin shows that the people who might be\nimagined most to support such eco-cleansing, the Aborigines, are in\nfact most often against it.43 For instance, they value and exploit the\nintroduced cats and have in some cases made them part of their\nculture. While the monstrous damage done to Australian environments\nis incontestable, programmes for a restored ecology can also serve the\ncultural nationalism of a white majority anxious to \u2018belong to\u2019 or more\nlegitimately appropriate the continent, assuaging a legacy of guilt by\ncutting down elm trees and exterminating cats. Tim Low argues that\nAustralia\u2019s now hybrid fauna and flora need sometimes to be accepted\nand celebrated for what they are.44\nIn sum, environmental politics cannot be decided for us by the\nscience of ecology. It must be more like politics elsewhere, the art of\nmaking the least bad decision in the face of incompatible, singular\nclaims. As the Australian example shows, even those who wish to\nreserve moral importance to the human species alone cannot coherently\ndo so without regard to the ethical claims of the non-human.\nNotes\n1 Jacques Derrida, Elisabeth Roudinesco, For What Tomorrow: A Dialogue (Stanford\nCA: Stanford University Press, 2004), 71.\n2 The few years since Derrida\u2019s death have already altered the resonance of such\na passage as the following: \u2018I have no right to abandon my responsibility under\nTimothy Clark 33\nthe pretext that this responsibility is modest, under the pretext that its effects are\nincalculable; one cannot calculate one\u2019s responsibility, so its effects may well be\nnothing, almost nothing. In response to an emergency, I do what I can. I may\nwell be able to do a lot, I may well be able to do very little, even nothing \u2013\nwhatever, I have no right to withdraw from doing something, under the pretext\nthat it will be done in vain.

More than a decade ago, Ian Anderson\nwrote,\nAgriculture is one of the mainstays of Australia\u2019s economy. But ironically,\nthe country is not well suited to the European styles of farming that are\npractised. \u2018That Australia\u2019s agriculture has been as productive as it has is\na testament to Australians\u2019 innovation, technical skill and determination\nover two centuries,\u2019 say government scientists in a paper prepared for\na meeting of the Prime Minister\u2019s Science Council last month. The\ncountry\u2019s soils are thin \u2013 most are less than 10 centimetres deep \u2013\nand contain little organic matter. The weather is not dependable either,\noften fluctuating between prolonged drought and severe flooding. Added\nto this, Australia\u2019s native mammals have padded feet that do minimal\ndamage to soil. By comparison, the hooves of imported animals are far\nmore destructive. (p. 12)\n\u2018According to Jason Alexandra of the ACF, this list of woes is\nevidence that Australia is depleting its resources by trading agricultural\nTimothy Clark 35\ncommodities for manufactured imports.
