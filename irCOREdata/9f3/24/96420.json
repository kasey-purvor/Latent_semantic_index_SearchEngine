The origins of British IR Theory are traced, and the \nimportance of the \u2018English School\u2019 is stressed, partly because of the work it stimulates, but \nalso because of its role as a brand which helps to establish the independence of British IR \nfrom the otherwise dominant American profession.  Along with English School scholarship \n(pluralist and solidarist), work on Political Theory and International Relations, and Critical \nTheory, including Critical Security Studies, are the major areas where contemporary IR \nTheory in Britain is located.  This is likely to persist, but the generally critical approach \ntaken to social scientific theorising may be changing, with the increasing importance of \nHistorical Sociology and Critical Realist work.  It may also be the case that the privileged \nstatus of IR Theory in British IR may be under challenge. \n \nIntroduction: \nIn keeping with the task of describing the development of IR theory in the UK, much of this paper \nwill consist of an historical account of the subject, but before proceeding it will be helpful to \nprovide a context by identifying some of the key features of that development, namely the changing \nstatus of Britain in the world, the importance of the English language, the existence of a native \napproach to IR, the \u2018English School\u2019 and a distinctive, albeit somewhat limited, approach to the \nsocial sciences.  Each of these points will be addressed in turn, but, as will become apparent, they \nare quite closely related and between them have shaped much of the substantive work done in \nBritain in the discipline. \n First, when the study of International Relations was first established in the UK, immediately \nafter the First World War, Britain was, if not the dominant world power, then at the very least a co-\nequal with the United States.  By the end of the Second World War, the UK was one of the P5  \nbut clearly outgunned by the US and the USSR.  After 1945, Britain became a middle-ranking \npower, her influence mainly exercised as America\u2019s putative best friend. As will be argued below, \nBritish thinking about IR places a great deal of stress on the importance of international institutions, \ninternational law and norm-based approaches more generally, and it is not fanciful to suggest that \nthis has something to do with Britain\u2019s loss of near-hegemonic status.   \n But, second, although Britain\u2019s quasi-hegemonic status disappeared, the English language \nremains the language of the discourse of IR \u2013 however, the great majority of academic users of the \nlanguage live elsewhere, in the United States, and the story of the development of IR theory in the \nUK cannot be separated from the US narrative. In 1977 Stanley Hoffmann famously declared \nInternational Relations to be an American discipline and although the discipline has grown in the \nUK it is still but a small fraction of the US profession and British academics in the field measure \nthemselves against the American discipline (Hoffmann, 1977). \n However, third, unlike most other national IR communities, Britain has its own brand, with \nextensive recognition in the US and elsewhere \u2013 the \u2018English School\u2019 (ES). More on this below, but \nit should be noted here that the ES reinforces the first factor described above by emphasising \ninstitutions and norms and is a partial counter to the second by providing a way of doing IR that is \nexplicitly not American, something valued by many who would not explicitly identify with the \nSchool.  Fourth and finally, by way of preliminaries it should be noted that in the UK, unlike the \nUS, the largest departments of IR have been separate from departments of Government and Political \nScience.  British scholars have in the past looked to Philosophy, History and Law to play the role \n 2\nplayed in the US by Political Science or the Social Sciences in general. It is still the case that most \nBritish IR scholars are sceptical of social science methodologies, especially quantitative methods.  \nAmerican critics characteristically accuse British IR of lacking in \u2018rigour\u2019; British scholars reply \nthat History, Philosophy and Law have their own notions of rigour. \nBeginnings: \nThe first endowed Chairs of International Relations in the UK were established at Aberystwyth \n(1919), the London School of Economics (1924), and Oxford University (1930) by philanthropists \nhorrified by the destruction of the First World War, but theorizing international relations had a \nmuch longer history than these dates would suggest.  First, Britain had been a great power within \nthe so-called Westphalia System for 250 years before 1914, and its nationals had contributed to the \ncommon discourse of European statecraft; much of the ES comes out of this discourse.  Second, \npolitical economists and \u2018Manchester School\u2019 liberals developed a sustained critique of balance-of-\npower politics based on of a perceived harmony of interests brought about by the mutual gains from \ninternational trade, theorized by Adam Smith and David Ricardo in non-zero-sum terms. In the \nyears before the 1914-18 war these liberals were behind the  progressivist assumptions widely held \nby the intelligentsia in Edwardian Britain, namely that industrial society had changed the nature of \ninternational relations, that war was an obsolete international problem-solving mechanism, only \nlikely to be resorted to if special interests dominated state policy, and that gradually the world \nwould move towards a global constitutional order, characterised by the rule of law. \n Building on this background, the reaction to 1914-18 created the \u2018liberal internationalist\u2019 \napproach to IR which runs in parallel with contemporary American Wilsonian internationalism. \nTwo components were central to this approach, each reflecting a reading of the events of 1914: \nnational self-determination and democratic government domestically was seen as the answer to the \nproblem of militarism and irredentism; collective security and the rule of law were seen as the \nanswer to the failure of diplomacy in 1914.  Characteristic of later British theorising of IR, this was \nboth an explanatory and a normative theory, with descriptive and prescriptive elements. This \n 3\nposition would later be described as \u2018idealism\u2019 or \u2018utopianism\u2019 by \u2018realist\u2019 writers such as E.H. Carr \nand Hans J. Morgenthau but this was a one-sided judgement. The so-called idealists of the inter-war \nperiod were actually far more hard-headed that their detractors were willing to admit \u2013 they were \nwell aware of the problems associated with international organisation, and the difficulty of \novercoming nationalist sentiments (Long & Wilson, 1995).  Realist critics were certainly right to \nthink that liberals found it difficult to put together an intellectually coherent position to take on the \nrise of Hitler and the dictators in the 1930s, but Carr\u2019s own approach was essentially to support the \nappeasement policy of the Chamberlain government, which as well as being morally dubious, was \nclearly ineffective. \n In retrospect Carr\u2019s 1939 study The Twenty Years Crisis is now seen as a classic statement \nof the realist position, still referenced by leading 21st century realists on both sides of the Atlantic, \nbut it would be a mistake to exaggerate his contemporary influence (Carr, 1939\/2001; Mearsheimer, \n2005: International Relations Roundtable, 2005).  Carr held the prestigious Woodrow Wilson Chair \nat Aberystwyth until 1947, but in the post-war period lost interest in the discourse of IR which he \ncame to regard with some contempt.  Meanwhile, the package of liberal ideas described above \ncontinued to dominate IR theory, not that this was particularly difficult since it remained the case \nthat this was a very small field, which remained so until the expansion of the university study of IR \nin Britain in the 1960s and after. But, before this expansion took place, British IR theory had been \ngiven a major boost by the formation in 1958 of the Rockefeller Foundation-funded \u2018British \nCommittee on the theory of international politics\u2019  (hereafter the British Committee). \nThe British Committee and IR Theory in Britain 1958 - 1977: \nThe British Committee brought together an eclectic group of scholars \u2013 historians, philosophers and \ntheologians, but also some figures who are genuinely difficult to classify, including Martin Wight \nand the secretary to the committee, Hedley Bull.  Perhaps the most striking feature of the \nCommittee\u2019s membership from the perspective of  21st century Britain is the important role played \nin its deliberation by theological issues; the only professional theologian  on the committee was \n 4\nDonald MacKinnon, but Herbert Butterfield, also from Cambridge, was a deeply committed \nChristian historian, the author of Christianity, Diplomacy and War, and Martin Wight was a \nChristian pacifist who had been a conscientious objector in World War II (Butterworth, 1953).  \nAccounts of the British Committee make it clear that MacKinnon \u2013 one of the most important \nBritish theologians of the century \u2013 was a leading figure in its deliberations, and much of the \ndiscussion was conducted in a theological idiom, to a degree that would be inconceivable today \n(Dunne, 1998; Vigezzi, 2005).  \n Perhaps as a result, values and norms played a disproportionately large role in the \ndeliberations of a Committee ostensibly devoted simply to the \u2018theory of international politics\u2019, and \nthe first, and best, published product of the Committee \u2013 Herbert Butterfield and Martin Wight\u2019s \nDiplomatic Investigations (1966) reflects this emphasis.  Equally, the notion that they were \nexploring International Society, as opposed to, say, the International System, was a leitmotif of the \nCommittee\u2019s work, and again implies the importance of grasping international relationships as \nnorm-governed.  But how distinctive was the work of the Committee?  It certainly provided the \ngroundwork, and much of the superstructure, for what later became known as the ES, but most of \nthe time the Committee were engaging with issues that had been part of the European tradition of \nstatecraft that had developed over the preceding centuries \u2013 and that includes the explicitly \nnormative issues it addressed.  Its work was steeped in the diplomatic lore of Westphalia; the \nBritish Committee tended to deplore the less savoury elements of the tradition but otherwise their \nthinking rarely strayed too far from the middle ground of the traditions of Europe.  Equally, while \nthe influence of Christian theology on their work may seem distinctive from the perspective of \n2009, it was much less so in the 1950s and 60s; although the British Committee members were by \nno means orthodox Cold Warriors, it is certainly the case that their concern for norms and values \nwas in part shaped by the ideological struggle with Soviet Communism, a struggle that was played \nout on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1950s.   \n 5\n In fact, the notion that the work of the Committee is distinctive, and thus can be \ncharacterised as the basis of a specifically national school of thought, is best understood as a \njudgement that was made some time later, after the changes that took place in the American \ndiscourse of international theory in the 1960s and 70s, in particular the rise of the \u2018behaviouralist\u2019 \nschool and the dominance of rational choice theory in American IR (Waltz, 1979; Keohane, 1984). \nIn effect, the British Committee, a.k.a. the ES after the early 1980s, was trying to keep current what \nhad been the common approach to the theory of international relations in the \u2018Anglosphere\u2019 for the \nfirst half of the twentieth century \u2013 and, in the person of Hedley Bull, the Committee led the charge \nagainst the new, putatively \u2018scientific\u2019 IR theory (Bull, 1996). The central point here is that the \nBritish Committee spawned a distinctive school of IR not as a conscious strategy, but simply by \ncarrying on doing what they had always done, at a time when others in the US were quite radically \nchanging gear. \n Why did British and American theorists gradually adopt different trajectories at this time? \nPart of the story here relates to the \u2018Two Cultures\u2019 problem in British intellectual life, the inability \nof the humanities and the sciences to communicate (Snow 1966).  Figures such as Bull, Wight and \nButterfield were almost pathologically non-scientific in their approach to the world.  But the parting \nof the ways might also be related to institutional factors.  Aside from a small number of schools of \ndiplomacy, International Relations was studied in the US as a sub-branch of Political Science, and \ngraduate education in the field usually involved exposure to the methods of the behavioural \nsciences, the work of comparativists and, at least at a minimal level, of contemporary political \ntheorists.  The much smaller contingent of British academic scholars in International Relations were \nmostly to be found in specialist IR Departments, in particular at LSE and Aberystwyth, or in think-\ntanks such as Chatham House; the infiltration of ideas from Political Science was more difficult \nunder these circumstances, and a common assumption among IR scholars was that their subject was \nsui generis with its own theories and specialised vocabulary distinct from the other social sciences.  \n 6\n The Committee became the basis for the ES in the 1980s, but estimating its  contemporary \ninfluence is difficult.  In the 1950s the field was very small and the work of the Committee was \nlittle known outside of the LSE where Bull and Wight taught, and perhaps Cambridge, where IR \nwas barely taught at all.  Certainly in the mid-1960s Diplomatic Investigations was immediately \nrecognised as an important collection \u2013 but it is worth remembering that even at LSE, which was \nthen pretty much established as the spiritual home of the Committee, the leading intellectual \ninfluences within the Department were not affiliated to the Committee.  More to the point, whereas \nLSE and Aberystwyth had been the sole major Departments in the time before 1964\/65, with the \nmajor expansion of British higher education that took place then the academic study of IR began to \ntake off.  The new universities branded themselves as non-traditional, and International Relations \u2013 \napparently \u2018relevant\u2019, and attractive to students \u2013 fitted this profile, but at the same time the ethos of \nthe new institutions was not friendly to the rather old-world nature of the British Committee.  \nThrough the 1960s and 1970s there were many other branches of IR theory current \u2013 for example, \nthe groups of conflict and peace researchers centred around John Burton at University College, \nLondon, or associated with Michael Nicholson and the Richardson Institute, which came to be \nbased at the University of Lancaster, or the radical theorists of North-South relations at Sussex \nUniversity, the strategists in \u2018War Studies\u2019 at Kings College, London, or the Institute of Strategic \nStudies, along, of course, with many independent scholars whose work cannot be summarised so \neasily.  It was also the case that, in the 1970s, a number of theorists were attracted to the work of \nsome American scholars on complex interdependence and European integration \u2013 in short, no \nsimple account of what \u2018IR theory\u2019 meant in Britain in  the 1960s and 70s is possible; in the 1980s \nand 1990s the position became a little clearer, and this will be the subject of the next section.  \nContemporary International Relations Theory in Britain: \nThe contemporary IR discourse in Britain could be seen as beginning with the publication of Bull\u2019s \nThe Anarchical Society which became the inspiration for the ES, but the publication of articles by \nRobert Cox and Richard Ashley in the early 1980s could also be seen as seminal in inspiring British \n 7\n\u2018post-positivism\u201d (Bull, 1977; Cox, 1981; Ashley, 1984).  Post-positivism is a rather confusing \nterm; here it indicates a resistance to the broad commitment to covering-law models of explanation \ncharacteristic of contemporary American Political Science.  With a few distinguished exceptions \n(e.g. Nicholson, 1989), British scholars of IR have not engaged in formal theory or in the use of \nquantitative, econometric methods to test hypotheses, and have not contributed to the \u2018normal \nscience\u2019 that has sprung up around the neorealist\/liberal institutionalist research programme \ndeveloped by American IR theorists. The standard process of establishing independent, dependent \nand intervening variables, setting up one\u2019s hypotheses and then testing them as laid down by the \nstandard texts on Political Science methods, is not one much engaged in by British IR theorists. \nInstead, the latter characteristically invoke different goals of inquiry \u2013 understanding and \ninterpretation rather than explanation \u2013 resist quantification and formal theory, and focus quite \nheavily on conventional historical narratives.  Beyond the negative quality of not being like US IR \ntheory, it is rather more difficult to summarise the positive features of contemporary British IR \ntheory; for most of the rest of this section the different bodies of work produced since \napproximately 1980 will be described before, in the next section, addressing the future.  One final \npreliminary: there is a sense in which everyone who contributes to the discipline of International \nRelations is a \u2018theorist\u2019 in so far as they reflect on what they do, but in what follows I will focus on \nthose who self-identify as theorists, conscious that this does some injustice to important figures who \nwrite in the area of foreign policy analysis, international political economy, strategic studies and the \nlike.  I will allow myself only one exception to the rule, by simply mentioning in passing some of \nthe work of British IPE specialists \u2013 in particular that of Susan Strange, a dedicated anti-theorist \nwhose work on the interaction between money, credit and political power was actually deeply \ntheoretical, providing the best guide to the current credit crunch \u2013 and the British-based Gramscians  \nwho have done so much to develop Robert Cox\u2019s thought (Strange, 1997; Tooze & May, 2002; Gill, \n1983). \nThe English School: \n 8\nHedley Bull\u2019s The Anarchical Society (1977) can be seen as both a summary of the thinking of the \nBritish Committee, and the starting point for the development of the ES, once Roy Jones had \nidentified the latter in 1981, and this identification had been adopted by its adherents (Jones, 1981).  \nBull\u2019s position established a framework, but left open some of the most important issues. After a \nwhile, thanks especially Nicholas Wheeler, these issues came to be conceptualised as based on the \ndifference between \u2018solidarist\u2019 and \u2018pluralist\u2019 accounts of international society (Wheeler, 1992; \nDunne & Wheeler, 1996).  Both pluralists and solidarists take a state-centric view of the world and \nboth agree that international society is norm-governed; where they differ is over the nature of the \nnorms in question, and the telos of international society. \n For the pluralists \u2013 who include within their number Robert Jackson, James Mayall and, \nmost of the time, Bull himself \u2013 the normative framework of international society consists of \nvarious institutions that are designed to facilitate co-operation between polities who may have quite \nradically different conception of the Good (Jackson, 2000; Mayall, 1990).  These institutions \ninclude such practices as diplomatic immunity, and those elements of international law which are \ndesigned simply to facilitate co-operation and co-existence.  Attempts to understand international \nsociety as an entity that might be collectively committed to goals that go beyond co-existence are \ndoomed to fail \u2013 states may well wish to co-operate to pursue e.g. the expansion of trade via the \nWTO but this is a body whose members have chosen to join, whereas the core institutions of \ninternational society are not voluntary, but bind all its members.  This is possible precisely because \nthese institutions are not goal-directed.   \n Solidarists, on the other hand, see a society of states as desirable because it constitutes a \nrational political order for humanity taken as a whole.  Human flourishing requires social \nintercourse which in turn requires political order, that is, a context within which the general \narrangements of society can be attended to, laws made and enforced, hard cases adjudicated. \nProblems of scale alone would make a single global political order impossible; laws lose their \neffectiveness at a distance, and tyranny is less likely if political society occurs on a human scale. \n 9\nThus, a multiplicity of political authorities \u2013 an international society \u2013 is the best arrangement for \nrealising the good for humanity taken as a whole. As Bull puts it, rather uncharacteristically, in a \nlate work, states are \u2018local agents of the common good\u2019 (Bull, 1984).  This conception of an \ninternational society clearly is consistent with the current international human rights regime in a \nway that the pluralist account is not. Whereas pluralists see the role of international society as being \nto underwrite the continuation of different conceptions of the Good, solidarists believe that there is, \nat root, only one such conception and international society provides the framework within which \nthis conception can emerge.  Thus, Wheeler\u2019s Saving Strangers traces the putative emergence of a \nnorm of humanitarian intervention via UN Security Council Resolutions in the 1990s \u2013 this is a \nprogressivist reading of international society, and one which grants more weight to the role of \nnorms than any realist, or most solidarists, would allow (Wheeler, 2000).  Wheeler\u2019s account is \novertly constructivist, and the links between constructivism and the solidarist wing of the modern \nES are clear (Dunne, 1995). \n Constructivist connections are also made by Barry Buzan in his attempt to establish the ES \nas a research programme to stand alongside the dominant American research programmes of \nNeorealism and Liberal Institutionalism (Buzan, 1993).  Buzan argues that the ES provides a \nmethodology that can be applied to a range of different situations, and, in an era of globalisation, it \nis possible that it may be more profitably devoted to an explication of the notion of a \u2018world \nsociety\u2019, even if for the time being a state-centric approach is called for (Buzan, 2004).  There is no \ndoubt that Buzan\u2019s initiative has had the effect of keeping alive debate on the core ideas of the \nSchool at a time when it seemed likely that they were running out of steam \u2013 and he and his \ncollaborators, especially Richard Little, have also very valuably linked ES thinking to the study of \nlong-term historical patterns building on the work of Adam Watson (Buzan & Little, 2000; Watson, \n1992).  Finally in this section, mention should be made of the work of two scholars who neither fall \neasily into the solidarist-pluralist distinction, nor are part of Buzan\u2019s re-launch.  Andrew Hurrell\u2019s \nrecent major work On Global Order is a conscious attempt to bring together solidarist and pluralist \n 10\napproaches within the ES, while Ian Clark in a series of monographs has established himself as \ncurrently the most productive scholar to be using the notion of international society to frame his \nwork (Hurrell, 2007; Clark, 2007 a & b).  Both of these authors offer an original approach to themes \nestablished by the ES, even as they break away from an explicitly ES straitjacket. \nPolitical Theory and International Relations: \nTerry Nardin\u2019s work typifies the new-found significance of political theory for IR theory, but could \neasily have appeared in the previous section. His account of international society as a \u2018practical \nassociation\u2019 fits neatly into the pluralist position, but is based on the work of Michael Oakeshott \nrather than that of Hedley Bull (Nardin, 1993).  It is also worth noting that Nardin is a US citizen \u2013 \nand it might be asked why his work (and for that matter that of the Canadian Robert Jackson) \nappears in an essay devoted to British IR theory?  The answer is straightforward; most British \nscholars have little to contribute to contemporary mainstream American theorising, but the same is \nalso true of the minority of North American theorists who are not \u2018positivists\u2019 as that term is \ndefined above.  These latter scholars have much more in common with the British mainstream, and, \non the whole, their work is more highly valued on this side of the Atlantic.  Post-positivist IR theory \nis one area where British and American scholarship is still closely interrelated and on terms of \nequality \u2013 the American minority and the British majority are of roughly equal size in absolute \nterms, and British training in political theory (as opposed, for example, to methodology) is as good \nas its American equivalent.  Nardin and Jackson are contributors to a genuinely transatlantic \nintellectual enterprise. \n Something similar could be said of another major aspect of the interface between political \ntheory and IR theory \u2013 that concerned with international\/global justice.  Here a short-list of major \ncontributors might include Chris Brown, Charles Beitz, Simon Caney, Thomas Pogge, John  Rawls, \nHenry Shue and Michael Walzer, and the fact that one of these scholars is British (Caney) and \nanother works in the UK (Shue) is of little significance \u2013 they all contribute or have contributed to \nthe same, Anglo-American, discourse (Beitz, 1979\/1999; Caney, 2005; Pogge, 2005; Rawls, 1999; \n 11\nWalzer, 2007). It is also interesting that none of these authors self-identify as scholars of \nInternational Relations; they see themselves as political theorists who engage with international \ntopics \u2013 the distinction between IR theory and Political Theory fades away for them in the same \nway that it does for IR theorists such as Mervyn Frost, Nicholas Rengger and the present author \nwho are based in International Relations Departments (Frost, 2008, Rengger, 1999; Brown, 2002).\n The distinctive feature of this discourse is a questioning of the state-centric framing of the \nissue of justice in the theoretical literature of International Relations. Such a framing leads more-or-\nless inevitably to a vision of justice as between states that is essentially procedural rather than social \nor distributive, and that is summarised by principles of international law such as sovereign equality, \nnon-intervention and non-aggression; on this account, the manifest inequalities of income, wealth \nand resources that characterise real-world relations between states are irrelevant from the \nperspective for justice \u2013 a just international order is simply one in which states relate to each other \non the basis of impartial rules, impartially applied.  It is fair to say that all the writers listed above \nreject the view that this state of affairs can simply be taken for granted in the way it has been by \ntheorists of international relations \u2013 some of these writers, (Rawls, Walzer, Brown) hold that the \nstate (or \u2018people\u2019 in the case of Rawls) remains the core institution for the delivery of justice, but \nfor them this is a conclusion that has to be justified in terms of features of the community (state, \npeople) and cannot simply be taken as a premise of the discussion.  The other named writers reject \nthis conclusion; they hold the cosmopolitan position that the appropriate frame of reference for \nquestions of justice must be the global community consisting of all humanity.  Just as inequalities \nwithin domestic society need to be justified, so international inequality needs to be subjected to \nmoral scrutiny \u2013 and the conclusion of these writers is that such scrutiny can only lead to the \nconclusion that current inequalities are radically unjust and must be rectified. \n As against this position, John Rawls argues that a full account of justice, distributive as well \nas procedural, is possible only for a \u2018people\u2019 governed by common political institutions and \npossessed of a moral nature; there is no \u2018global people\u2019 of this nature, and so global justice remains \n 12\nprocedural \u2013 liberal and decent peoples have a duty to help \u2018burdened societies\u2019 to reach the point at \nwhich they can develop just institutions and become members of a society of peoples, and although \nthis duty could involve some actual redistribution it is more likely to take the form of promoting \ngood, responsible and effective political practices.  As will be apparent from this discussion, much \nof this work operates in the realm of \u2018ideal theory\u2019; the point of the exercise is explicitly \nprescriptive \u2013 the aim is to provide a model of a just world order against which existing institutions \nand policies can be measured.  In a sense, this work recaptures some of the spirit of the \n\u2018idealist\u2019\/\u2019utopian\u2019 literature of the inter-war period. \n The interface between political theory and IR theory has had other manifestations than that \nof the justice industry.  One has been a more sophisticated account of the \u2018classics\u2019 writers, ancient \nand modern, than was characteristic of an older generation of IR theorists.  This is visible in \noverviews of the field (Boucher, 1998; Brown, Nardin & Rengger, 2002)  and in studies of \nparticular traditions, such as Michael Williams\u2019 work on Hobbes and Morgenthau (Williams, 2005). \nFigures such as Kant and Hegel who were largely ignored, or radically misunderstood, by British \nCommittee scholars are now given their due (Brown, 1992).  And, of course, international political \ntheorists have contributed extensively to the literature on human rights, cultural diversity and \nhumanitarian intervention. \nCritical Theory \nThere are three bodies of work within contemporary IR theory in Britain which can be described as \n\u2018Critical Theory\u2019.  The first two are directly linked  to the Frankfurt School notion of critical theory, \nand the project of \u2018knowledge as emancipation\u2019 knowledge associated with Frankfurt, and recently \nin particular with J\u00fcrgen Habermas (Habermas, 1986).  These are the theorising of cosmopolitan \ndemocracy of Andrew Linklater and David Held, and the \u2018Critical Security Studies\u2019 movement \nassociated especially with Ken Booth (Linklater, 2008; Held, 2004; Booth, 2007).  Held and \nLinklater approach the issue of cosmopolitan democracy from somewhat different directions, \nalthough both are Habermas-influenced, and both link their ideas to the phenomenon of \n 13\nglobalisation.  Held\u2019s work is orientated towards an explicitly normative account of the need to \ndemocratize contemporary international relations; the central thesis is that, in an age of \nglobalization (of which Held has been a major theorist) the desire for democratic self-government \ncan no longer be met at a national level and so the project of democratizing the international order \nmust be prioritized, however difficult a task this may be.   \nLinklater is less concerned with institutional change, more with the transformation of \nnotions of political community, and the evolution of an ever-more inclusive dialogue.  This touches \non a great many themes in contemporary British IR theory \u2013 and in many respects Linklater is a \npivotal figure in the discourse.  His first book, Men and Citizens in the Theory of International \nRelations, was a major early contribution to the reuniting of political theory and international \nrelations, ranging over a study of the major contributors to the law of nations, and ending with a \ndiscussion of Kant, Hegel and Marx, while one of his most recent books, co-edited with Hidemi \nSuganami, is a major study of the ES (Linklater, 1981; Linklater & Suganami, 2006) . The Marxian \nside of Linklater\u2019s work relates in particular to issues of political economy, the Hegelian to the \nimportance of community, but it is the Kantian\/Habermasian notion of moral development that has \nincreasingly dominated his work, and he is currently committed to a large-scale trans-historical and \ntrans-cultural project on the notion of \u2018harm\u2019, some element so of which have recently been \npublished in his recent collection on Critical Theory and World Politics.  Doubt may well be \nexpressed as to whether the notion of \u2018harm\u2019 really can be stripped of its cultural and historical \nunderpinnings, but in any event, his is, overall, the most impressive contribution to the development \nof theory in British IR since the work of Hedley Bull. \nThe only serious competitor for the latter accolade would be Barry Buzan, whose \ncontribution to the revitalised ES is noted above.  Buzan is also, perhaps inadvertently,  a \ncontributor to critical security studies \u2013 his book People, States and Fear is a key contribution in so \nfar as it changed for ever the previously more-or-less automatic assumption that the referent object \nof security was the military security of the state (Buzan, 1991). Instead, Buzan argues that the term \n 14\nmust be given a wider frame of reference, and his work with his collaborators in the \u2018Copenhagen \nSchool\u2019 of security studies (in particular, Ole W\u00e6ver) has focused on how issues, often of a non-\ntraditional nature \u2013 such as environmental change or migration \u2013 become \u2018securitised\u2019 (Buzan et al \n1997).  This work is constructivist rather than normative and much closer to the Habermasian \nnotion of critical theory is the work of the \u2018Aberystwyth School\u2019, especially that of Ken Booth.  For \nBooth, security, whether of states, groups or individuals, is ultimately an ontological status, that of \nfeeling secure, which at any one time may be under threat from a number of different directions \u2013 \nBooth places most emphasis on the security of the individual which he sees as threatened by a \nnumber of features of contemporary international politics, but perhaps most especially by the state \nitself. Denial of human rights, ill-treatment and persecution for reasons of gender or sexual \norientation, the deprivations of famine and poverty \u2013 these are all factors that threaten the security \nof individuals and for Booth they should be the focus of critical security studies.  His recent \nmagnum opus, Theory of World Security is a ambitious, wide ranging study the message of which is \nthat the current state of the world is dire and getting worse \u2013 only a wholesale recasting of the \ninternational order will prevent disaster, and such a recasting will be bitterly resisted by the \nbeneficiaries of the current, unjust order.  \nThe third group of critical theorists, who I name here the \u2018late modernists\u2019 would agree with \nmuch of Booth\u2019s diagnosis, but part company with his, and Linklater\u2019s, belief that Enlightenment \nvalues and human rights are part of the solution to the ills of the world as well as, in some respects, \npart of the problem.  \u2018Late Modern\u2019 is a portmanteau term and most of these authors will resist any \nsuch label, but these authors can be considered together because they share the view that the notion \nof critique must be extended to the central Enlightenment belief that knowledge can be the basis of \nhuman emancipation. Like several of the other bodies of work discussed above, this is an area \nwhere British IR theory means IR theory produced in Britain, rather than by Britons, and where \ntransatlantic connections are very evident; as with political theorists more generally, many of those \nmarginalised by the North American IR community find a somewhat more congenial home in the \n 15\nUK, although I am sure they would not wish for this congeniality to be over-stated.  There is a great \ndeal of work that could be considered here; a few areas only will be mentioned. \nFirst, perhaps, should be noted the Foucaldian work on \u2018governmentality\u2019 and \u2018biopolitics\u2019 \nof authors such as Michael Dillon and Julian Reid (Dillon & Reid, 2008; Reid, 2006); this work \nreshapes the notion of sovereignty by focusing on the constitution of life itself. Equally powerful \nare David Campbell\u2019s studies of an \u2018ethic of encounter\u2019 drawing in particular on Levinas, but \napplied to the first Gulf war and the Bosnia crisis (Campbell, 1998 & 1999).  Campbell\u2019s work very \neffectively problematises conventional accounts of applications of \u2018just war\u2019 and those approaches \nto international ethics which take the identities of parties to a conflict for granted \u2013 from his \nperspective these identities are constructed through encounter and by political leaders.  Somewhat \nsimilar themes are discussed from a more Lacanian perspective by Jenny Edkins \u2013 and as with \nCampbell (and rather against the stereotypical view of post-structuralists) \u2013 she is always keen to \nlink this work to \u2018real-world\u2019 issues such as the politics of famine, and the traumatising effect of \npolitical violence (Edkins, 2003 & 2008).  \n There is no particular reason why an emphasis on gender in international relations, or a \nfeminist approach to the subject, should necessarily be \u2018late modernist\u2019 \u2013 and in many disciplines it \nis not \u2013 but in IR theory the association seems inevitable; certainly scholars such as Christine \nSylvester  and Cynthia Weber would probably self-identify with this wing of contemporary IR \ntheory  (Sylvester 2001; Weber, 2004).  This work ranges very widely, from feminist critiques of \nrealism, to studies of women\u2019s co-operatives, from the relationship between the women\u2019s \nmovement and peace movements, to the way in which the international helps to constitute male and \nfemale identities.  To what extent it can be said to have changed the field outside of its own \nspecialised area is debateable \u2013 most general IR courses now have a \u2018Women and IR\u2019 lecture \n(usually at the end of the course), but pay very little attention to this work.  Still, the very fact that \n\u2018tokenism\u2019 is now required is perhaps of significance. \nFuture Trajectories? \n 16\nIt is as difficult to predict the future of IR theory in Britain as it is to predict the future of IR in \ngeneral, but one thing that can be said is that a generational shift is currently taking place.  Of the \nauthors identified above as important within contemporary IR theory, Booth, Brown, Buzan, Clark, \nFrost, Linklater, and Little are all at, or within a few years of, retirement age, and although none of \nthem show any inclination to stop writing, or indeed to retire, it is more or less inevitable that their \ninfluence will decline in the years to come.  However, the next generation of scholars have already \nproved their worth, and in some areas no gap will be visible as the older scholars fade away; writers \nsuch as Rengger, Dunne and Wheeler, along with others of a younger generation not mentioned \nabove, such as Toni Erskine and Anthony Lang, will readily take their place (Erskine, 2008; Lang, \n2007).  Most of the \u2018late modern\u2019 writers mentioned above are also of the younger generation, but \nwhat is less clear is who eventually will take the place of the leaders of the Critical Security Studies \nmovement, Buzan and Booth. \n So much for continuity \u2013 what of change?  Two areas currently under construction are worth \nlooking at briefly, both of which, interestingly, have a rather different attitude towards the dominant \nUS discipline than that evinced by the post-positivists whose scepticism in respect of American IR \ntheory was outlined above.  These two areas are not in any genuine sense \u2018positivist\u2019 or committed \nto the kinds theory that still dominate the American discourse but they share with that discourse the \ngoal of social science \u2013 that is to say that they do not share the anti-scientific attitudes characteristic \nof the dominant modes of British theorising of the last few decades. These two areas are Critical \nRealist IR Theory, and International Historical Sociology. \n Critical Realism is a branch of social theory which developed from \u2018scientific realism\u2019.  \nScientific realists stress the possibility of reliable knowledge of theory-independent phenomena \neven when the latter are unobservable; critical realists apply this approach in order to defend the \nemancipatory possibilities of social scientific knowledge in the face of both late-modern critics of \nscience and more conventional, so-called positivist, social scientists; the latter are seen as unable to \nunearth  features of social systems which are not directly observable (such as social structures) and \n 17\ncommitted to an inappropriate division between positive and normative knowledge.  The inspiration \nfor a great deal of critical realist work is Marxian; Roy Bhaskar is an important influence (Bhaskar, \n1987).  \n IR scholars in this field have been much concerned with the \u2018agent-structure\u2019 problem  and \nwith the nature of causation \u2013they are particularly concerned to combat the, as they see it, simplistic \nnotion of causation common in mainstream social science; these are interests which have produced \na fruitful interaction with some branches of American constructivism, especially the work of \nAlexander Wendt (1987).  A central figure here is Colin Wight, who provides an overview of a \ngreat many of the methodological problems that have beset IR theory, in the process demonstrating \nthat they are not actually methodological problems, but rather relate to ontological issues, the nature \nof reality (Wight, 2006).  Equally important is Milja Kurki\u2019s restatement of the importance of \nAristotelian notions of causation in the face of the dominant Humean understanding of a cause as a \nconstant conjuncture (Kurki, 2008).  This work has yet to stimulate a great deal of \u2018applied\u2019 IR \ntheory but it has played an important role in shaking the dominant post-positivist approach to the \nfield. \n \u2018International Historical sociology\u2019 is more difficult to define (Hobden & Hobson, 2001).  \nEssentially it brings together an interest in sociological theory, large-scale historical studies and, \noften, historical materialist approaches, along with theories of the state (Rosenberg, 1994). This \nkind of work gives a distinctive twist to themes identified earlier; it extends the range of \ninternational political theory in the direction of international sociological theory, it picks up the \nES\u2019s interest in history but disassociates it from the School\u2019s own particular narrative of \ninternational society, and it links with a left\/Marxian tradition but without being committed to the \nreading of that tradition offered by the Frankfurt School and their British followers.  Moreover, the \ninterest in Weber and Durkheim that has been stimulated by this discourse also fits into much realist \ntheorising \u2013 touching base with the Weberian roots of Morgenthau\u2019s work, and Waltz\u2019s explicit use \nof Durkheim. Critical realist work in IR is, at the moment, largely devoted to methodological \n 18\nissues, but the promise is that it will promote scientific empirical work; historical sociologists are \nalready engaged in such work, albeit for the time being on a small scale.   \nAn interesting possibility is that this may actually prefigure a move away from Theory in \nBritish IR, which may be no bad thing (Brown, 2006).  For a variety of reasons, \u2018theory\u2019 has taken \ncome to have more significance in British IR than might be deemed altogether healthy; when the \nBritish International Studies Association (BISA) was formed in the early 1970s it was by no means \nas dominated by \u2018theory\u2019 as it is today and few of the early theorists of IR discussed above thought \nof themselves primarily as theorists \u2013 theory was an outgrowth from empirical study.  This was, a \nhealthy attitude, although nowadays the level of sophistication demanded of theorists is much \nhigher than it once was. Without denying the importance of theory it is not unreasonable to say that \nthe balance between theoretical and empirical work has been a little too slanted towards the former \nin recent years \u2013 the balance is now tilting back in the other direction, not because of a rejection of \ntheory, but because of the growth of approaches to theory which are more open to a fruitful \ndialogue between theory, practice and empirical study. \n \nBibliography: \n \nAshley, Richard (1984) \u2018The Poverty of Neorealism\u2019 International Organisation (38), 225 \u2013 86.  \nBeitz, Charles (1979\/1999) Political Theory and International Relations (Princeton NJ: Princeton \nUniversity Press). \nBhaskar, Roy (1987) Scientific Realism and Human Emancipation (London: Verso). \nBooth, Ken (2007) Theory of World Security (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press). \nBoucher, David (1998) Political Theories of International Relations (Oxford: Oxford University \nPress). \nBrown, Chris (1992) International Relations Theory: New Normative Approaches (Brighton: \nHarvester Wheatsheaf). \n 19\nBrown, Chris (2002) Sovereignty, Rights and Justice (Cambridge: Polity Press). \nBrown, Chris, Terry Nardin and Nicholas Rengger (eds) (2002) International Relations in Political \nThought (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press). \nBrown, Chris (2006) \u2018From International to Global Justice\u2019 in John S Dryzek, Bonnie Honig & \nAnne Phillips eds.
