In this paper, we explore the \nmethodological consequences of our argument for recognising post-socialist difference \nstrategically without collapsing it into homogenous categories (authors, forthcoming). We \nmake the case for a more sustained effort to apply ethnographic methods and to develop \nwhat Haraway calls an \u201cethnographic attitude\u201d in geographical work on post-socialist \nchange. We show how ethnography enhances our understanding of post-socialist change \nbefore considering the contribution that ethnographies of post-socialism make to broader \ntheorisations and conceptualisations in geography and the social sciences. Ethnography is \nadvocated here as a way to constantly re-examine the value of established theories and \nconcepts against the background of different scenarios as well as a search for new, \ncontext-related theories. Post-socialist change presents a number of challenges to \nethnographic research, which are discussed in the paper. We focus particularly on \nquestions of theory applicability, representation, empirical- methodological approach, and \nethics. \n \nIntroduction \nIn our paper \u201cPosting Socialism\u201d we draw on the work of postcolonial critics in order to \ndevelop approaches for researching post-socialist transformation that recognise difference \nas an important strategic devise for provincialising western knowledge and for \nchallenging \u2018transitology\u2019. We also argue for vigilance against essentialising difference, \nhowever, in order not to erase the plurality of experience. Further, we see the \nidentification of connections across east\/west binary divides as equally important for \ncritical geography projects that seek to move beyond the traditional confines of \nmarginalised \u2018area studies\u2019 (Smith, 2002). These theoretical contentions have major \nmethodological implications, which we seek to address in this paper. Far from regarding \nthe how of geographical research as a secondary concern, we agree with feminist \nresearchers (Harding, 1987; Oakley, 1981; Mies, 1994; Nast et al., 1994) that questions \n 1\nof methodology are central to the project of constructing emancipatory knowledges. Our \nargument in this paper is for a more sustained and committed effort to deploy \nethnographic approaches, both in geography generally and in research on post-socialist \ntransformations particularly. It is our conviction that ethnographic research is best able to \naddress, work through and theorise the contradictory experiences of post-socialist change. \n \nDespite a substantial increase in the use and appreciation of qualitative methods generally \nin human geography over the last two decades (Limb and Dwyer, 2001; Rose, 2001; \nShurmer-Smith, 2002), we find that the radical potential of ethnography, not just as a set \nof methods (e.g. participant observation) but as a substantially different approach to \nresearch remains underexplored (Herbert, 2000). In research on post-socialist societies, \nthis reluctance to engage with the work and methods of ethnographers has been even \nmore pronounced. Although geographers have been amongst the most ardent critiques of \n\u2018transitology\u2019 (Pickles and Smith, 1998; Pickles and Unwin, 2004; Bradshaw and \nStenning, 2004; van Hoven, 2004; H\u00f6rschelmann 2002), few have engaged in a sustained \nway with existing ethnographic research or have adopted it as a methodological approach \nto study the economic, political, social and cultural changes associated with post-socialist \ntransformation (but see Pickles 2001; Dunn, 2004; Boren, 2005; H\u00f6rschelmann and \nSch\u00e4fer, 2005; Smith and Stenning, forthcoming; Stenning 2005). This is particularly \nsurprising given the quantity of work in ethnography and anthropology on post-socialist \nchange in recent years (Hann, 2002; Berdahl et al., 2000; Bridger and Pine, 1998; \nBurawoy and Verdery, 1999).  \n \nIn this paper, we argue that the reluctance to embrace ethnographic ways of theorising \nand researching comes at a price. We seek to demonstrate the value of ethnography for \ngeographical research on post-socialist societies and argue, with Herbert, that \u201cthe \nbenefits merit the challenge. A geography that seeks better understandings of how social \nstructures and human agents are stirred and separated in everyday spatial contexts must \nembrace more, and more rigorous, ethnography\u201d (Herbert, 2000: 564). Drawing on the \nwork of key ethnographers in the field of socialist and post-socialist studies, we pose and \n 2\nrespond to the following questions, which arise from our own engagement with \nethnographic work over the past few years: \n \n1) How does ethnography enhance our understanding of post-socialist change?  \n2) What difference do ethnographies of post-socialism make for broader \ntheorisations and conceptualisations in geography and the social sciences? \n3) What does post-socialism mean for ethnography? Which challenges does it \npresent to the discipline? \n \nThese questions are addressed in the context of recent critiques of ethnographic practice \nas formulated particularly by feminist and postmodern writers. We feel that research on \npost-socialist transformations brings the relevance of these critiques to the fore, but also \nshows why and how ethnography is able to address them. It is our aim to show that \nethnography is most valuable for understanding post-socialist change when it is placed \nwithin a multi-sited context and critically intervenes in broader theoretical debates \n(Marcus, 1986, 1998). Counter to those who see ethnographic accounts as either \nillustrations of how \u2018the global system\u2019 works in specific places or as a collection of \nstories about disconnected cultures, we argue for ethnographies of post-socialist change \nas a potent means to question the supremacy of macrological accounts without retreating \ninto the mosaic realm of discrete cultural differences. Geographers can make significant \ncontributions to this by problematising understandings of space, place, area and scale. In \nour conclusion, we sketch some of the ways in which geographical thinking can be \nbrought to bear more beneficially on ethnographic analyses of post-socialism1 and show \nhow ethnographic approaches can be incorporated into geographical research. \n \n                                                 \n1 In this paper, we are primarily concerned with research on societies that have \nexperienced and exited state-socialist systems, but there are good reasons to question this \nrestricted definition in as far as the revolutionary changes of the late 80s\/early 90s have \ninaugurated a post-socialist period with effects on politics on a global scale (authors, \nforthcoming). \n 3\nHow does ethnography enhance our understanding of post-socialist change? \nThere is a significant degree of variation in descriptions of ethnography. Hammersley and \nAtkinson (1995) adopt a fairly non-restrictive approach, defining it as \u201cprimarily a \nparticular method or set of methods\u201d that \u201c[i]n its most characteristic form \u2026 involves \nthe ethnographer participating, overtly or covertly, in people\u2019s daily lives for an extended \nperiod of time, watching what happens, listening to what is said, asking questions \u2013 in \nfact, collecting whatever data is available to throw light on the issues that are the focus of \nthe research\u201d (1). Geographers have most frequently chosen a variation of this definition \nin their discussions of ethnography (Herbert, 2000). However, what marks the particular \ncharacteristic of ethnography for many of its contemporary practitioners involves more \nthan the application of a certain set of methods. It is about a sustained, critical effort to \nnegotiate the contradictions between seeking an understanding of people\u2019s situated, \ncontext-specific social interactions and interpretative schemas of their \u2018worlds\u2019 (van \nMaanen, 1995) and the epistemological risk of bringing one\u2019s own, theoretically \ninformed and not-so-innocent interpretations to these observations (Wolff, 1996). \nHaraway has described this as an \u201cethnographic attitude\u201d which can be brought to a range \nof subjects rather than as a set of methods: \n\u201cTo study technoscience [and human science] requires an immersion in worldly \nmaterial-semiotic practices, where the analysts, as well as the humans and \nnonhumans studied, are all at risk \u2013 morally, politically, technically, and \nepistemologically. \u2018Ethnography,\u2019 in this extended sense, is not so much a specific \nprocedure in anthropology as it is a method of being at risk in the face of practices \nand discourses into which one inquires. To be at risk is not the same thing as \nidentifying with the subjects of study; quite the contrary. And self-identity is as \nmuch at risk as the temptation to identification. One is at risk in the face of serious \nnonidentity that challenges previous stabilities, convictions, or ways of being of \nmany kinds. An \u2018ethnographic attitude\u2019 can be adopted within any kind of inquiry, \nincluding textual analysis. Not limited to a specific discipline, an ethnographic \nattitude is a mode of practical and theoretical attention, a way of remaining mindful \nand accountable. Such a method is not about \u2018taking sides\u2019 in a predetermined way. \n 4\nBut it is about risks, purposes, and hopes \u2013 one\u2019s own and others\u2019 \u2013 embedded in \nknowledge projects.\u201d (Haraway, 1997: 190f; cited in Schneider, 2002: 471f) \nThe situated accounts of ethnographers, especially in a world of \u2018flows\u2019, relations and \ninterconnections, enable purposively partial perspectives from within the dense networks \ndescribed by geographers like Amin (2002), Thrift (1996), Massey (1999) and others that \nenable a radical politics of difference which not only recognises \u2018other actors, spheres, \nscales and places\u2019 (Nagar et al., 2002) but shows how their actions and interpretations \nsquare with (equally situated) macrological accounts. We agree with Herbert (2000), who \nviews ethnography as \u201ca uniquely useful method for uncovering the processes and \nmeanings that undergird sociospatial life\u201d (550). He argues that ethnography is able not \nonly to unearth taken-for-granted concepts and to thereby \u201creveal the knowledge and \nmeaning structures that provide the blueprint for social action\u201d (551), but also to examine \n\u201cwhat people do as well as what they say\u201d (552). Importantly, Herbert\u2019s emphasis on \nprocesses and meanings leads him to recognise ethnography\u2019s potential to reveal \nchallenges to macrological structures as well as the details of their reproduction. \nEthnography\u2019s task is thus not primarily the empirical description of everyday life, but \nmaking connections between micrological observations and broader interpretations and \ntheorisations. \n \nPost-socialist ethnographers view the benefits of their work in very similar ways. \nAnthologies published recently by anthropologists and ethnographers (Hann, 2002a; \nBurawoy and Verdery, 1999; Bridger and Pine, 1998; Berdahl, Lampland and Bunzl, \n2000) underline particularly the necessity of examining grand theories of transition \nagainst the reality of localised social practices and meaning constructions. Starting from \nthe recognition that shock therapy approaches and neo-liberal economics have delivered \nan impoverished understanding of post-socialist transformation and have, due to their \nuniversalism and one-dimensionality, resulted in socially and culturally insensitive \npolicies of limited success (Hann, 2002b), anthropologists and ethnographers have called \nfor greater awareness of the divergent ways in which transition is lived, experienced and \ninterpreted by locally embedded social actors. They concur with path dependency theory \n(Stark and Bruszt, 1998) in regarding \u2018transition\u2019 as neither a complete break with the \n 5\npast nor a predictable historical process, but place more emphasis on the way the past is \nselectively applied in contemporary social practices and on its cultural construction \n(Humphrey, 2002a and 2002b; Creed, 1998; authors, forthcoming). Ethnographers have \nalso traditionally shown a stronger interest in marginalised groups and practices, which \narguably leads them to develop a more complex understanding of social agency \n(Humphrey and Mandel, 2002). The value of ethnography for conceptualising post-\nsocialist change has been summed up well by one of its most renowned practitioners \nduring and after the Cold War, Caroline Humphrey, who observes that in a situation of \nuncertainty, \u201cwhen each action is both the unmaking of a previous way of life and a step \ntoward a new, unknown one\u201d (2002a: xx), anthropologists2 are most able to capture the \nspecifics and generalities of socio-cultural transformation: \n\u201cAnthropology\u2019s strength is its rootedness in the everyday, in its familiarity with \nthe practices that ethnographers are able to observe and question \u2026, \nanthropologists have tended to conceive their objects in terms of meaning, that is \nrequiring interpretation. Since the reflexive turn of the 1980s, they have understood \nthat such \u2018objects\u2019 are both discovered and created, in other words that they are in \nsome aspect an artifact of the anthropological process itself.\u201d (ibid: xviii) \nWhile highlighting the need for reflexivity, Humphrey here also draws our attention to \nthe meanings constructed by locally embedded social actors. This is a further issue \nfrequently raised by ethnographers researching the post-socialist situation. They \nencounter a complex interpretive terrain, where western concepts such as \u2018the market\u2019, \n\u2018employment\u2019, \u2018class\u2019 or \u2018civil society\u2019 take on distinctly different meanings from those \napplied by policy makers and non-governmental agencies. Ethnographic research can \nhave significant political impacts in as far as it promotes \u201ca better understanding of the \ndifferent meanings of key terms in the eastern European context\u201d (Hann, 1998: xiv; also \nsee Hann and Dunn, 1996). We come back to this point later, but would emphasise here \nthe relevance of ethnographic work for understanding how conceptual differences affect \n                                                 \n2 The terms \u2018ethnography\u2019 and \u2018anthropology\u2019 are used interchangeably in the literature, \nsince the traditional distinctions between ethnography as the study of other, \u2018ethnic\u2019 \ncultures and anthropology as concerned more broadly with human cultures and societies \nis no longer tenable. \n 6\nthe implementation, acceptance and negotiation of policies in specific post-socialist \ncontexts. \n \nWork by post-socialist ethnographers is distinguished most from other types of research \nby the attention paid to local practices and interpretations of living through and surviving \ntransition. Most ethnographers eschew broad generalisations and instead examine how \nlocal actors reconfigure their lives in the context of broader economic and political \ndevelopments and how they explain the changes they encounter (Burawoy and Verdery, \n1999): \n\u201cWith their focus on the fine-grained details of everyday life, anthropological \nstudies not only have contributed a unique awareness of and perspective on the \nexperience of \u2018transition\u2019 but have examined its multiple dimensions and \ntrajectories. In so doing, anthropologists have challenged a certain linear, \nteleological thinking surrounding the collapse of socialism and pointed to the \ncontradictions, paradoxes, and different trajectories of post-socialist societies.\u201d \n(Berdahl, 1997: 9) \nWhat may appear as surprising departures from the path of transition to a capitalist \nmarket economy in research oriented towards the macro-level, becomes comprehensible \nin ethnographic texts as the result of interpretive connections that people make between \npast and contemporary experiences and as strategies to survive the transformations of the \npresent both literally and in terms of personal and social identities. References to past \nideologies and practices are shown to be part of the negotiation of contemporary realities \nthat can be seen as a \u2018rational\u2019 response indeed from the perspective of the local actor \nrather than as an unreflective nostalgia for outmoded models of thought (West, 2002; \nPine and Bridger, 1998; Lampland, 2002). Ethnographers emphasise that these references \nto the past entail a significant amount of reinterpretation, but that they also represent a \nsymbolic resource both for making sense of the present and for challenging the new \n\u2018status quo\u2019. A highly illuminating example of this is offered by Gerald Creed (1998) in \nhis study of socialism and transition in rural Bulgaria. He shows that many \nmisconceptions about post-socialist societies today are rooted in a limited understanding \nof the way in which socialism was \u201cdomesticated\u201d, made liveable, in the past. To Creed, \n 7\nthe treatment of rural Bulgarians\u2019 continued reference to socialism as a \u2018communist \nlegacy\u2019 not only misses the way in which villagers had adjusted socialism to their needs, \nbut also that the embrace of domesticated socialism is a defence against would-be \ncapitalist excesses, an attempt to use socialism to domesticate capitalism (277). He \nconcludes that \u201cnuances are missed by those who never recognized the domestication of \nsocialism and who retain mutually exclusive views of communism and capitalism. A real \ntransition hinges on overcoming this opposition through ethnographic appreciations and \nexpositions of local interests in their historical contexts\u201d (278). \n \nLike Creed, many ethnographers are critical of images of a sudden transition or even \n\u2018revolution\u2019 and use their inside knowledge of (post-)socialist societies to sketch longer \nprocesses of change as well as to highlight the fate of the many who were located off-\ncentre in the events that sealed the demise of socialist governments (Pine and Bridger, \n1998; Giordano and Kostova, 2002). Transition for them is not a self-chosen path, but an \nimposed new reality which, even if it is welcome, needs to be interpreted and negotiated \nin concrete local contexts that are often quite far removed from those of the activists of \n1989: \n\u201cMore than a world moving forwards, or even a world turned upside down, we \nseem to have before us a world moving sideways and backwards, simultaneously \nand often skewed. The ways that people talk about the past and the present, and \ntheir ambivalence about both \u2018modernity\u2019 and \u2018tradition\u2019, reflect this confusion.\u201d \n(Pine, 2002: 98) \nHow people find their way in this confusing situation and which interpretative schemes \nthey apply when, how and why is best captured by ethnographic research, since it seeks \nactively to avoid presumptions and to theorise on the basis of close-up observation. It is \nbecause of this openness towards empirical specifics that ethnographers, rather than \npresenting us with a singular perspective, develop a number of theoretical perspectives \nand cover a broad range of topics, a brief list of which includes: the construction of \nnational and ethnic identities (Anderson, 2000; Barsegian, 2000; Brown, 2000; Wanner \n1998; Zircovic, 2000), border constructions (Berdahl, 1997), changes in gender relations \n(Pine, 1998, 2002; Heyat, 2002; DeSoto, 2000; Kuehnast, 2000), the transformation of \n 8\nfamily and friendship relations (West, 2002), markets and informal economic systems \n(Humphrey, 2002a; Kaneff, 2002; Mandel and Humphrey, 2002), processes of and \nresistance to decollectivisation (Creed, 1998; Lampland, 2002), religion and ritual \n(Vitebsky, 2002), relations of trust\/mistrust (Giordano and Kostova, 2002; West, 2002), \nnew social actors and networks (Humphrey, 2002a; Sampson, 2002), class identities \n(Kideckel, 2002), meanings and practices of consumption (Latham, 2002), or \nreconfigurations of time and space (Verdery, 1996, 2001). While these are issues \ngenerally not sufficiently addressed in macro-level research, what makes ethnography\u2019s \ncontribution so valuable and distinctive is its focus on contextualised cultural \ninterpretation and local practices: \u201cThis is the strength of ethnography. It can show how \neveryday practices and social relationships are embedded in the peculiarities of local \npaths of social change, and in trajectories of possible becomings\u201d (Kalb, 2002: 323). \nEthnography creates a fuller and more differentiated picture of post-socialist \ntransformation from a spatially and historically distinct position. Rather than seeking to \neradicate the difference that place makes, it strategically employs positionality to provide \na grounded perspective that explains how large-scale processes are interpreted, responded \nto and (re)produced by social actors in specific locations. \n \nWhat difference do ethnographies of post-socialism make for broader theorisations \nand conceptualisations in geography and the social sciences? \nEthnography\u2019s tendency towards observation at the scale of everyday, \u2018local\u2019 interactions \nat the expense of broader theoretical connections and comparisons has been one of the \nkey areas of critique in recent years, however. George Marcus (1986, 1988) thus noted \nthat interpretive ethnographies frequently fail to show how closely observed cultural \nworlds are embedded in larger systems and what role these worlds have in historical \nevents: \n\u201cChange and the larger frameworks of local politics have usually been treated in \nseparate theoretical or conceptual discourse with some ethnographic detail added \nfor illustration. The descriptive space of ethnographies itself has not seemed an \nappropriate context for working through conceptual problems of this larger order. \n 9\nThe world of larger systems and events has thus often been seen as externally \nimpinging on and bounding little worlds, but not as integral to them.\u201d (ibid.: 166) \nBringing ethnographic observations and broader theorisations into conversation for us, \nhowever, not only demands recognition of the embeddedness of \u2018localities\u2019 in global \nprocesses, but also the recognition that ungrounded macrological accounts are insufficient \nfor observing, valuing and understanding the lived worlds of \u2018transition\u2019 and that they can \nbe challenged by ethnographic research. Post-socialist ethnographers have sought to do \nexactly that. While viewing the specific contexts in which they conduct their observations \nas strongly embedded in wider networks of global capitalist expansion (see especially \nBurawoy and Verdery, 1999), they have shown that conceptualisations of capitalism may \nneed to be revised together with simplistic understandings of socialism\/communism as \n\u2018totalitarian\u2019 societies, if phenomena like \u2018the market\u2019 are shown to become constituted in \nquite unexpected ways where capitalist structures are newly emerging (Humphrey and \nMandel, 2002). \n \nThe specific situation of post-socialist countries also offers historic opportunities for \nexpanding our understanding of social change and how it occurs under conditions of \nsystemic transformation. While we would caution against regarding the post-socialist \nsituation as a convenient laboratory space for social observation and would neither claim \nthat it is the only example of radical systemic change, we agree with Daphne Berdahl \n(1997), that for anthropologists, and for other social scientists, \u201cpost-socialist transitions \noffer opportunities to explore some of the central issues of the discipline: the relationship \namong economic systems, political entities, and culture; the construction of identity, \nethnicity, and nationalism; social and cultural change\u201d (11). \n \nA further contribution that post-socialist ethnographies can make to broader theorisation \nin the social sciences is that they return the gaze to ask whether the concepts applied in \nEast Central Europe and the former Soviet Republics today reflect actual conditions in \nthe West or whether they are ideal-types whose value for understanding established \nmarket economies equally needs to be questioned (Pine and Bridger, 1998; Verdery, \n2002). As Hann (2002b: 10) asks provocatively: \u201cHave Western elites, supported by the \n 10\ndominant disciplines of transitology, systematically promoted models for the post-\nsocialist countries that bear little connection to the social realities of their own \ncountries?\u201d One way to respond to this provocative question and to bring the insights of \npost-socialist ethnographies \u2018home\u2019 to the centre would be to conduct thoroughly \ncomparative research in east-west contexts and to thus assess critically the validity of \nwestern concepts and models in both situations. \n \nIn addressing questions about contemporary global conditions, post-socialist \nethnographers contribute to the two-way flow of theorisation that Smith identifies as \ncentral to analyses of trans-local and trans-national phenomena (2002). They demonstrate \nthe need for a more questioning attitude towards constructions of socialist and post-\nsocialist societies while joining others in their efforts of dismantling imperialist, \nhomogenising understandings of \u2018the West\u2019 and \u2018the rest\u2019 (also see Stenning, 2005b). In \norder to achieve this, however, we argue elsewhere (authors, forthcoming), studies of \npost-socialism need to manage the fine balance between recognising difference and \nexceptionalism, which homogenises post-socialist contexts, accentuates difference from \nother countries and disconnects in a way that prevents analysis of post-socialist societies \nas fully embedded in global networks and relations (Kalb, 2002). \n \nWhat does post-socialism mean for ethnography? What challenges does it present to \nthe discipline? \nThere have been numerous critiques of the ethnographic approach in recent years. In \nparticular, the tendency to remained fixed in single localities, to reiterate rather than to \nquestion boundaries, to conceptualise culture in homogenous and all-encompassing ways, \nto participate in the construction of \u2018otherness\u2019 and in cultural colonialism as well as to \nadopt particular rhetoric strategies uncritically have come under scrutiny (Clifford and \nMarcus, 1986; Khare, 1998; Wolff, 1996; Hobbs and May, 1993; van Maanen 1995; \nReed-Danahay, 1997; Wolff, 1992; Davis, 1999; Clifford, 1988). To this list we may add \nthe tendency to concentrate on rural places, which restricts the insights that ethnographies \ncan deliver for urbanised and urbanising societies. Researchers too quickly assume that \nthe boundaries of rural communities are clearly defined and that village structures allow \n 11\neasier insights into local networks and social relations. The challenge is to recognise both \nthe reconstitution of communities and relations beyond locality in rural areas and to find \nways of conducting ethnographic research sensibly in the potentially more complex urban \narena. Finally, there has been an over-emphasis on cultural issues at the expense of \neconomic questions in much ethnographic work, which current research on consumption \nand household economies is seeking to alter (Smith, 2004; Smith and Stenning, \nforthcoming). \n \nPost-socialist ethnographers, while engaging with these critiques, have had to confront \nfurther problems arising from the particular context of their research. They argue that the \npost-socialist situation poses additional challenges to ethnography as well as underlining \nthe currency of previous critiques. Ries (2000) has divided the critical issues arising from \npost-socialism for ethnographic research into several interconnected categories of which \nwe focus particularly here on theoretical, representational, empirical-methodological and \nethical aspects. \n \nTheoretical Issues \nA major problem for ethnographers, as for other researchers of post-socialist societies, is \nthe question of theory applicability and formation. How far do existing theories travel? \nHow applicable are they to the local situation? Do they help or hinder us to understand \nthe specific scenarios encountered in post-socialist societies? A starting point for \nanswering these questions is the recognition that western researchers bring their own \nhistorical baggage to the situations they study. As Katherine Verdery (1996, 2002) makes \nclear, Cold War ideologies have positioned us strongly in both, the former East and West, \nleading to taken-for-granted notions about the self and the other and to strong \nassumptions about the value and universality of concepts such as \u2018democracy\u2019, \u2018the \nmarket\u2019, or \u2018civil society\u2019 that need to be questioned rather than unthinkingly applied in \nthe post-socialist context (also see Hann, 1998; Watson, 2000). She suggests pursuing \npost-Cold War rather than post-socialist studies, since this reflects the renegotiation of \nidentities and concepts that needs to take place on both sides of the former divide (2002). \nIt is a point that relates more generally to ethnographic practice and the politics of \n 12\nresearch. Sustained engagement with the lives and perspectives of others as it is central to \nethnographic research is rarely a harmonious process. Rather, it works through \nconflicting world views whose \u2018reconciliation\u2019 relies far too often on uneven power \nrelations which tame the difference of the other. Critical ethnographers seek to resist \nthese efforts of taming and to explore the radically unsettling potential of contradictory \nexperiences, to open spaces for their expression. Some of the most insightful work in this \nrespect is produced by those who make visible the points of irreconcilable difference and \nof fractured positions (this is particularly noticeable in work on spirituality and ritual; cf. \nAnderson, 2000; Humphrey, 2002a; Kaneff, 2002). In searching for ways of making the \ntensions and necessarily unresolved contradictions of research work on the texts of the \nanalyst, ethnographers are sketching paths that critical geographers can track with much \ngain in order to challenge their own positions, including the recognition that Cold War \ninterpretative schemas have indeed left a legacy on them. We find this kind of reflexivity \nstill sorely missing in geographical work. It is our conviction that unearthing and \nchallenging the ways on which geographical thinking has been shaped by Cold War \nnarratives should have consequences for research far beyond the post-socialist context \n(authors, forthcoming; Stenning, 2005b). \n \nRepresentation \nThese issues of terminology relate strongly to the debates on representation which have \ntaken place in ethnography since the 1980s.  Like many colleagues in their field, post-\nsocialist ethnographers recognise that their work frequently departs from the realist ideal \nof objective representation and involves a significant amount of rhetoric, as well as \nconstructing relations between other and self (Clifford and Marcus, 1986; Clifford, 1988; \nvan Maanen, 1995). As Ries explains: \u201cEthnographers go to post-socialist societies armed \nwith all kinds of nearly unexaminable perceptions, mythic categories, and competitive \nstances and encounter there people similarly equipped\u201d (x). Yet, it is not only the \nhistorical background which can influence the research encounter, as Kuehnast (2000) \nindicates in her call for greater reflexivity: \n\u201cConducting fieldwork in the post-socialist era is an ethnographic opportunity for \nnegotiating identities between anthropologist and informant. Whether these \n 13\nidentities are remnants of the Cold War or fragments of the global marketization of \npopular culture, a reflexive approach is necessary to reexamine our assumptions \nabout the other.\u201d (114) \nWe have already mentioned the need to challenge the conscious and unconscious \nassumptions that the Cold War and subsequent developments have anchored in \u201cthe \ncognitive organisation of the world\u201d (Verdery, 1996: 4; quoted in Ries, 2000: x). These \nconcerns also relate to finding ways of communicating with research subjects (Pearson, \n1993). Feminist researchers have argued that, beyond seeking to level the playing field \ntowards research participants through the application of empowering methods, bottom-\nup-approaches etc., strong reflexivity is needed that \u201crequires the researcher to subject \nherself to the same level of scrutiny as she directs to her respondents\u201d (McCorkell and \nMyers, 2003: 205). Doing so, however, does not solve the problem of negotiating \ndifferent opinions between researcher and respondents, as Anderson\u2019s (2000) account \nmakes clear. He struggled to reconcile his own views of the social constructedness of \nethnic and national identities with the political interests of his research subjects in seeing \ntheir ethnic identity confirmed by a foreign anthropologist. Rather than accepting and \ncomplying with the \u2018native\u2019 view, Anderson argues that \u201cthe anthropologist has a duty to \nquestion directly the local value framework\u201d (138). Anderson finds that the \nethnographer\u2019s work is politically highly charged in post-Soviet states and emphasises \nthat to romanticise local knowledge is not a viable option: \n\u201cHow should people live? It is precisely this very subjective and moral question \nthat is at issue in every interaction within the post-socialist states. By giving an \nhonest diagnosis of how a narrowly defined national category might disappear, one \naccepts the invitation to think, alongside one\u2019s field hosts, about how the future can \nbe lived without the burden of building a nation.\u201d (145) \n\u2018Native\u2019 ethnographers are not absolved from responsibility either. While they may be \nable to access spheres closed to western observers and hold deeper insight into local \ncultural constructions, their position in the field can be compromised by the assumption \nof \u2018being one of us\u2019, while in their interpretations and representations, they face problems \nof commitment to and compliance with the norms accepted \u2018back home\u2019. As Barsegian \n 14\n(2000) explains with reference to his work on Armenian identities during the war with \nAzerbaijan: \n\u201cFor the Western anthropologist, observations and theories about post-socialism, \nwhether it resembles \u2018feudalism\u2019 (Verdery 1996) or \u2018neo-capitalism\u2019 (Kideckel \n1998), are both intellectually and ethically possible. For the native ethnographer, \nhowever, options are often reduced to just one \u2013 to join his or her people.\u201d (124) \nThe \u2018native\u2019 ethnographer can thus get trapped in the field and unable to afford the \ncritical presence a western researcher would be able to bring towards it. Such political \ncommitments and identifications with the subjects of research need to be laid bare and \nanalysed for their effects on the ethnographer\u2019s interpretations. \n \nWhile reflexivity in the conduct and interpretation of research is an important means to \nreveal power relations and the impact of cultural assumptions on the research process \n(Kuehnast, 2000), a further issue to consider is the representation of ethnographic \nfindings to one\u2019s readership. It is here that ethnographers often encounter major \nproblems. On the one hand, specific knowledge about post-socialist countries may be \nquite limited, so that much explanation is necessary in order to allow audiences to engage \nwith the research. At the same time, however, because ethnography often pushes the \nboundaries of what is taken for granted, it encounters a number of barriers in \nunderstanding and acceptance that force it to construct arguments within a framework \nwhich rarely fits its own approach. Anticipating and responding to audience assumptions \nin a way that does not compromise understanding yet also loses none of ethnography\u2019s \nrevealing and challenging insights is a tall order indeed. Ethnographers are confronted \nwith this problem particularly when seeking to demonstrate the relevance of their work to \npolicy makers. Yet it is the specific awareness of how political agendas are practically \napplied and not infrequently subverted in major and minor ways that constitutes one of \nethnography\u2019s key advantages over other approaches, as demonstrated in the work by \nVerdery (1999) on property restitution and Creed (1998) and Kaneff (2002) on de-\ncollectivisation. \n \n 15\nEmpirical and Methodological Issues \nA number of particular empirical and methodological issues arise for ethnographic \nresearchers in post-socialist societies, which have to do primarily with the significant \npace and scale of change. Thus on the one hand they face the challenge of finding \nmethodological approaches that are able to trace and to \u2018keep up\u2019 with often quite speedy \ntransformations, while on the other hand in places where new routines and structures are \nbecoming established the task is to find ways of identifying after the event what caused \nchange, how it occurred and who has been affected in what ways. \n \nSince many local structures have changed dramatically in post-socialist societies, it can \nalso be difficult for a researcher to establish who the key social actors are and what roles \nother community members occupy. Many social networks have become so fractured and \nloose that researchers encounter problems in finding informants that are well enough \nplaced to help them gain access. Barbara West (2002) describes this situation memorably \nin her account of transformation in Hungary. She found that \u201cthe transition from \nsocialism created an atmosphere in which no category, concept, symbol, or reference \npoint could be taken for granted\u201d (3): \n\u201cIt was the insecurities and fears of transition, much more than the atomizing \ntendencies of \u2018actually existing socialism\u2019, that caused a breakdown in the most \npersonal communities: households, kin groups, friendship circles, colleagues, and \nacquaintances.\u201d (ibid: 36) \nFor the researcher, this situation poses not only practical problems, but also means that it \nbecomes harder to identify narratives that are common and coherent enough for \nhermeneutic analysis. In a situation where taken-for-granted concepts and ways of doing \nare questioned radically, ethnography cannot seek to reconstruct and critique established \n\u2018cultural assumptions\u2019 but needs to focus more strongly on tracing how and why new \nconceptions emerge and what happens to those of the past. Further, because the objects of \ntheir observations are undergoing or have undergone rapid transformation, there is the \nquestion of validity across time. Findings may quickly become obsolete and change from \ncontemporary analysis to archival record. \n \n 16\nEthnographers are further presented with enormous obstacles in accessing data and \nrecords from the socialist period. Work by western ethnographers during the socialist \nperiod is sparse and was often written under conditions that demanded particular \nsafeguards in order not to compromise respondents\u2019 and the researcher\u2019s safety. Foreign \nethnographers were, and in some cases continue, to be seen as spies and most frequently \ndid not gain independent access to research locations and informants. None the less, these \nresearchers have produced rich descriptions and analyses of the socialist system that often \ndepart from conceived mainstream knowledge and give us a more nuanced understanding \n(see Humphrey, 1983; Creed, 1998; Verdery, 1983, 1991, 1996). Ethnography conducted \nby local specialists in the socialist period, on the other hand, shared different research \nobjectives and in many ways continued colonial tendencies of studying and describing \nthe cultures of ethnic \u2018others\u2019 (Kandiyoti, 2002). \n \nToday, there are still issues with the reliability of statistical and other records and some \nregions and places continue to be foreclosed to foreign ethnographers. They continue to \nexperience a degree of suspicion about their work and some level of surveillance, which \nprevents access to certain places, records and informants (Barsegian, 2000; Zanca, 2000). \nZanca describes the bureaucratic hurdles researchers may face and the difficulties of \nworking with as well as gaining respect from host colleagues, which he argues is \ncomplicated by the often significant wealth differentials (2000: 154f).  \n \nIn a context where local structures are becoming radically transformed, the question also \narises as to the suitability of place-bound research. This is an issue which connects with \nthe concerns of ethnographers, sociologists and geographers who question the validity of \ncommon notions of the local and the field at a time of increasing global flows (Appadurai \n1990). George Marcus in particular has argued for a multi-sited ethnography that is \ntheoretically informed but not overtheorised and that seeks to either follow structures, \nnetworks and relations or to trace interconnections between structures and relations from \nthe vantage point of one intersecting node (Marcus, 1998). Such a multi-sited \nethnography would discover \u201cnew paths of connection and association by which \ntraditional ethnographic concerns with agency, symbols, and everyday practices can \n 17\ncontinue to be expressed on a differently configured spatial canvas ...\u201d (ibid.: 82). The \ngeographer Cindi Katz (1994, 2004) has made a similar argument for the \u201cdisplacement \nof the field site itself\u201d, although she stays on relatively safe theoretical ground, working \nwithin a historical materialist framework where capitalist globalism provides the missing \nlink between the different sites she has studied ethnographically. This allows her to \nidentify power structures beyond the \u2018local\u2019 and to show how the latter is in many ways \ntrans-locally produced, but it allows for little contestation of grand-theories on the basis \nof ethnographic observation and restricts possibilities for unexpected findings. Marcus, \nby contrast, advocates a theoretically informed ethnography that leaves room for new \ndiscoveries, where knowledge is produced through the thick description and \ninterpretation of connections, associations and circulations. This is particularly relevant \nfor researchers of post-socialist transformations, who work with \u201can emerging object of \nstudy whose contours, sites, and relationships are not known beforehand, but are \nthemselves a contribution of making an account that has different, complexly connected \nreal-world sites of investigation\u201d (ibid.: 86). Deciding where to place oneself and how to \nfollow developing networks in the absence of a clearly defined field, however, is a \nchallenging task, as Comaroff and Comaroff (2003) have pointed out. In seeking to \nunderstand \u201coccult economy\u201d in post-apartheid South Africa, they go beyond Marcus\u2019 \nmulti-sited ethnography to advocate engagements with multiple dimensions and scales: \n\u201can ethnography as attentive, say, to processes occurring in virtual space as to those \nvisible \u2018real\u2019 places-under-production; to the transnational mass-mediation of images as \nto ritual mediations between human beings and their ancestors; to the workings of state \nbureaucracies or international courts as to the politics of \u2018traditional\u2019 chiefship and \ncustomary moots; to the flow of commodities across the planet as to marriage payments \nbetween lineages; and so on and on\u201d (169f). Such an ethnography \u201cdissolves the a priori \nbreach between theory and method\u201d (172), engaging the inductive with the deductive in a \nway that recognises the incompleteness of \u201ctheoretical scaffoldings\u201d in relation to \nconcrete worlds encountered in the process of research, but it also sees \u2018native \nknowledge\u2019 as one piece in the puzzle only, since \u201cthe local and the translocal construct \neach other, producing at once difference and sameness, conjuncture and disjuncture\u201d \n(ibid.; also see Ferguson, 1999). \n 18\n Such an approach entails a revision of ways of working ethnographically, since aspects of \nthe flows and connections we need to explore may not be accessible in situ, but require \nmovement along what Comaroff and Comaroff call \u201cawkward scales\u201d (2003). As \nHannerz points out, this may lead to less \u2018thick\u2019 descriptions as time and effort are \nstreched beyond locales (2003). Interviews become the main method of inquiry and much \nmulti-sited ethnography remains restricted to English-speaking contexts, although a \nthorough investigation of translocal flows and connections may well require much more \nvaried linguistic skills. \u201cPolymorphous engagements\u201d (Gusterson, 1997; cf. Hannerz \n2003) become typical of such ethnographies that still entail periods of research in specific \nsites, but where these periods are shorter and may be supplemented with \u201cfield work by \ntelephone and email, collecting data eclectically in many different ways from a disparate \narray of sources, attending carefully to popular culture, and reading newspapers and \nofficial documents\u201d (Hannerz, 2003: 212). \n \nSuch an approach, however, may highlight further the significant differences in \nconceptions of how research ought to be done that often exist between \u2018local\u2019 and foreign \nresearchers. Conceptions about what constitutes legitimate or scientific research can \nsignificantly hamper the application of particular methods. In post-socialist contexts, this \nproblem is compounded by the relative dearth of \u2018indigenous\u2019 ethnographers in the \nbroader field of social science, since ethnographic research was conducted only in \nethnology departments with a traditional focus on \u2018ethnic others\u2019. Geographers from the \nregion tend to view ethnographic methods as alien to the discipline, making connections \nacross epistemological divides difficult to establish. Research participants may also \ncontest the ethnographer\u2019s right to study particular aspects of their lives or decline \nsupport for work that they regard as unscientific or irrelevant. Of course, this is not just \nan issue of different conceptions of research, but often originates from difficult living \nconditions, where research can be seen as pointless, if it does not contribute to manifest \nlocal change for the better (Wolff, 1992, Motzafi-Haller, 1997). \n \n 19\nEthical Challenges \nThis brings us directly to the question of ethics. Ethnographers in post-socialist societies, \nlike others, need to ask who will benefit from their work and why they are conducting it. \nDuring the Cold War, research in socialist countries was often compromised by western \npolicy interests in finding out about conditions in socialist countries, so that the suspicion \nof researchers being spies was not entirely unfounded. Today, the call is for ethnography \nto be more directly policy relevant and to improve the lives of those researched \n(Schneider, 2002). We would contend that ethnographers are uniquely positioned to do \nexactly that since their accounts are able to demonstrate how macro-policies resonate \nwith local power structures, to show how they affect people and are negotiated by them \nand, importantly, to go beyond general measures of success or failure to identify more \nspecific effects in terms of social inclusion and exclusion. Again, work on property \nrestitution and rural restructuring here has shown, for instance, how ethnic minorities are \nfrequently marginalised in the implementation of these policies and the differential \ngendered effects they are having (Verdery, 2001; Pickles 2001; Dunn, 2004; van Hoven-\nIganski, 2000; Pine, 1998, 2002).  \n \nIn some countries, critical accounts can still risk the safety of respondents (see above), \nwhile the difficult living conditions in parts of the former socialist world mean that the \nmaterial needs of respondents take precedence over the single-minded pursuit of research \naims (Dudwick and DeSoto, 2000). Zanca (2000) and Anderson (2000) describe \nsituations in which they felt their research was compromised by needing to respond to \nrequests for help with establishing business contacts or with promoting specific political \naims. Resembling issues in Third World contexts, the problems that feminist researchers \nhave sought to address by developing empowering and participatory research approaches \n(Wolff 1996), are thus compounded here by high differentials in living standards \n(Kuehnast, 2000; Wolff, 1992). \n \nWhat these considerations make clear is that ethnography is indeed \u201cnot so much about \nphilosophical and methodological abstractions as about political and ethical \npracticalities\u201d (Smith, 2001: 25). It should and will seek to change the world, but this \n 20\ninvolves \u201cresponsibility for one\u2019s witnessing, and an always-open engagement of \ncontestation and critique\u201d (Schneider, 2002: 471). \n \nConclusion \nIn this paper we have sought to demonstrate the value of ethnography for analyses of \npost-socialist change. We have argued that it is ethnography\u2019s focus on cultural \ninterpretation and on the specifics of how social, economic and political structures are \nlived and (re)produced in localised contexts, that makes it so beneficial for research in \npost-socialist societies. Ethnography challenges the certainty with which transition \ntheorists of a neo-liberal persuasion have applied western concepts to the new context and \nwith which they have assumed the possibility of a linear transgression from one clearly \ndefined system to another. Paying close attention to the specific conditions of post-\nsocialist change, however, has not prevented ethnography from making wider theoretical \nclaims and connections. In particular, it contributes to reconceptualisations of taken-for-\ngranted concepts such \u2018the market\u2019, \u2018class\u2019 or \u2018civil society\u2019, while enabling further \ntheorisations of social change and posing questions about the validity of the models now \napplied in post-socialist countries for established capitalist societies themselves. On the \nother hand, in as far as post-socialist countries are linked into the global economy and \nadopt western models of governance and social organisation, much is to be learnt from \nexisting theories of capitalism and social change. Accordingly, ethnographers who seek \nto make broader connections engage strongly with Marxist and Weberian approaches, \nwith the work of 19th century social theorists like Polanyi, Simmel and Durkheim, and \nwith ethnographic theorists such as Goffman, Garfinkel, Turner or, more recently, \nBourdieu. The latter have been found particularly valuable for work that seeks to explain \ntransformations of identities, experiences of liminality and displacement, or the relevance \nand transformation of notions of social and cultural capital. Recent postcolonial and \nFoucauldian approaches have also been applied to support the analysis of colonial and \npostcolonial structures across the former Soviet empire and to diagnose the varied \ntechnologies of power and knowledge through which \u2018modernity\u2019 is produced in post-\nsocialist societies (see authors, forthcoming). Ethnography is thus not a call for \ntheoretical ignorance, but an aim to constantly re-examine the value of established \n 21\ntheories and concepts against the background of different scenarios as well as a search for \nnew, context-related theories. \n \nThe post-socialist situation poses a number of challenges for ethnography that we have \ndiscussed in depth in this paper. We have focused here particularly on those of s \ntheoretical, representational, empirical-methodological, and ethical nature (Ries, 2000). \nWhile many of the problems we have outlined bear similarities with ethnographic \nresearch in other places, we have aimed to show which of them are specific for and\/or \nintensified in the post-socialist context. \n \nIn this final section, we now wish to direct a few words to the relevance of geography for \nethnographic analyses of postsocialism. We find that, despite its emphasis on \ncontextuality and locality, the spatial construction of society often remains implicit rather \nexplicit in ethnographic accounts. As geographers, we feel that we can promote a greater \nunderstanding of the ways in which identities and livelihoods are shaped in relation to \nspace and place and demonstrate how displacement and the current reconfiguration of \nspace in urban as well as in rural areas affects people in post-socialist societies. New \nconceptions of place and identity, including cultural constructions of landscape, can be \ntraced by geographers in a range of social interactions and expressive forms, such as \nofficial discourses, artistic representations, media images and everyday conversations. \nGeographers can place particular emphasis on the spatial interlinkages and social \nrelationships that define territory and communities and seek out the \u2018spatial webs\u2019 \nthrough which life in post-socialist societies is becoming reorganised (Kalb, 2002). This \nimplies that global links and cross-cultural connections are made more explicit and that \ncomparisons are drawn with other contexts, such as those in developing countries. Again, \ngeographers can make a valuable contribution here (see Bradshaw and Stenning, 2004). \n \nFor geographers seeking to adopt an ethnographic approach in their research, a few \npractical issues arise, however. These are not dissimilar from some of the problems \noutlined earlier, but the disciplinary training of and expectations on geographers can \nexacerbate them. For a start, post-socialist research is still fairly marginal in the discipline \n 22\n(Stenning, 2005b), which can prove problematic when establishing supervisory teams or \nresearch networks including experienced colleagues with an adequate understanding of \nlocal conditions in the field. Lack of linguistic skill is a further problem (Smith, 1996), \nwhile time constraints may not allow for extensive ethnographic fieldwork. Of course, a \nwillingness to live in sometimes quite remote places is also required, which cannot be \nassumed and which may be problematic for personal as well as safety reasons. Enabling \ngeographers to overcome some of these obstacles by placing greater emphasis on \nlanguage learning and making provisions for extended periods of time spent in \u2018the field\u2019 \nwould help to provide some of the structural conditions needed for work that aims to \ndecentre western perspectives. \n \nIf deciding not to adopt a wholesale ethnographic approach, geographers may still be able \nto apply some of its methods to specific aspects of their research. They can also make \ntheir work more ethnographic by assuming some of the core aims and foci of \nethnography at various stages of their research (Wolcott, 1995). However, whether \napplying an ethnographic approach or not, we hope to have demonstrated here that the \narguments and insights developed by ethnographic researchers should thoroughly inform \ngeographic discussions of the meanings and processes of post-socialist change. \n \nReferences \nAmin, A. 2002: Spatialities of globalisation.
