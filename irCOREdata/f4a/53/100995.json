There exists a class of nuclei that are obtained by adding one nucleon to a loosely-\nbound nucleon-core system, for example 12Be, 9C, 18Ne. For such nuclei, one-nucleon overlap\nintegrals that represent single-particle motion can strongly differ from the standard ones due to\nthe correlations between the two nucleons above the core. The possible non-standard overlap\nbehaviour should be included in the interpretation of the experimental data derived from one\nnucleon removal reactions such as knockout, transfer and breakup, as well as the predictions\nof low-energy nucleon capture that leads to these nuclei. We investigate the non-standard\nbehaviour within a three-body model and discuss the challenges associated with this problem.\n1. Introduction\nOne of the most productive and perspective ideas in nuclear many-body theory is the concept\nof independent single-particle motion in the mutually generated mean field. It explains many\nnuclear observables qualitatively and provides a basis for quantative descriptions of nuclei within\nvarious versions of the shell model. Over the last decade, the experimental study of single-\nparticle motion has shifted towards nuclei near the edge of stability with the emphasis on\nthe occupation probabilities of single-particle orbits as indicators of the evolution of nuclear\nshell structure near the drip line. These occupancies are usually determined by comparing the\nmeasured cross sections of one-nucleon transfer, breakup, knockout and Coulomb dissociation\nreactions, to those predicted theoretically. In these calculations, the single particle motion is\nrepresented by the overlap integral between the many-body wave functions of neighbouring mass\nA and A \u2212 1 nuclei. Most theoretical analyses assume these overlaps can be calculated using\npotential models that employ standard Woods-Saxon potentials. With these potentials, at radii\noutside the binding interaction, the overlap integrals achieve their asymptotic form given by\nan exponential decrease with a decay constant \u03ba =\n\u221a\n2\u00b5S1N (A)\/h\u00af determined by the nucleon\nseparation energy S1N (A), with \u00b5 is the (A\u2212 1)+N reduced mass. This region gives important\ncontribution to the amplitudes of one-nucleon removal reactions and is crucial to predict direct\nnucleon capture reactions relevant to nuclear astrophysics.\nIt has been shown recently in Ref. [1] that there exist a class of nuclei for which one-nucleon\noverlaps can reach their asymptotics much later than usual. This class includes the nuclei at the\nlimits of nuclear stability with very similar one- and two-nucleon separation energies, S1N (A) and\nar\nX\niv\n:0\n80\n5.\n23\n42\nv1\n  [\nnu\ncl-\nth]\n  1\n5 M\nay\n 20\n08\nS2N (A), both of which are significantly smaller than for stable nuclei. Such nuclei, for example\n12Be, 9C, 18Ne, can be considered as cluster systems of a core and two valence nucleons. The\ncorrelations of the two nucleons outside of the nuclear core can lead to non-standard behaviour of\nthe overlap because even when one nucleon is removed far from the center-of-mass of the residual\nmass A\u2212 1 nucleus, it will still be affected by its interaction with the remaining loosely-bound\nnucleon in A\u2212 1.\nThe possibility for such an effect follows from the Feynman diagram approach in which\nthe asymptotics of the overlap integrals for many-body systems are represented by a sum of\ndifferent Feynman diagrams. It has been noticed by Blokhintsev [2] that, although in most cases\nthe standard point diagram gives the exponential decrease with the smallest decay constant\n\u03ba, sometimes other diagrams can give a much slower decrease than that governed by the\ndifferences in initial and final binding energies. The Feynman diagram technique, applied in [1]\nto one-neutron overlaps for core+2N cluster systems, suggests that although the standard term,\nexp(\u2212\u03bar)\/r, dominates at very large r, the contribution exp(\u2212\u03ba1r)\/r7\/2 from the generalised\ntriangle diagram, corresponding to the A\u2192 (A\u2212 2) +N +N \u2192 (A\u2212 1) +N virtual process, is\ndetermined by the decay constant \u03ba1 that can be larger than \u03ba by only 40%. It means that if the\nstrength of the generalised triangle diagram is large then its contribution can be noticeable for\nrange of r where the standard behaviour exp(\u2212\u03bar)\/r is traditionally assumed to be achieved.\nThe abnormal asymptotic behaviour was modelled in [1] for the \u300811Be|12Be\u3009 overlap by adding\na long-range potential to a local potential model. The resulting overlap was then used to predict\nlongitudinal momentum distributions for one-neutron knockout from 12Be. Comparison of the\nlatter to available experimental data suggests such abnormalities would take place for n\u221211Be\ndistances between 5 and 10 fm. However, the contribution from the generalised triangle diagram\ncan be calculated reliably only for r \u001d |\u03ba1 \u2212 \u03ba|\u22121, which for 12Be is r \u001d 2.5 fm, therefore, to\nunderstand the overlap behaviour at 5 \u2264 r \u2264 10 fm exact dynamical three-body calculations\nshould be carried out.\nHere, we calculate one-nucleon overlaps using a three-body core+2N model and compare them\nto the predictions of the standard potential model (Sec. 2). We discuss effects of non-standard\noverlap behaviour on nuclear reactions (Sec. 3) and challenge they pose for both theory and\nexperiment (Sec.4).\n2. Three-body calculations\nWe have performed three-body calculations for 12Be (10Be+n+n), 9C (7Be+p+p) and 18Ne\n(16O+p+p) assuming no structure for the 10Be, 7Be and 16O cores but taking antisymmetrization\ninto account using the Pauli Projection technique [3]. The three-body Schro\u00a8dinger equation has\nbeen solved by expanding the wave functions onto a hyperspherical harmonics basis. The overlap\nintegrals \u300811Be|12Be\u3009, \u30088B|9C\u3009 and \u300817F|18Ne\u3009 have been obtained by overlapping the three-body\nand two-body wave functions. The N -core Woods-Saxon potentials have been fitted to chosen\nseparation energies and the GPT potential [4] has been used for the NN interaction. The\nCoulomb p-core and pp potentials have been also included for 9C and 18Ne.\nPseudo 12Be. First of all the convergence of the overlap in the asymptotic region has been\ntested for a simplified case of 12Be in which the deformation and excitation of the 10Be core have\nbeen neglected and the n\u221211Be interaction was zero in all partial waves except for ` = 0. This\nhas enabled us to include terms up to Kmax = 120 in the hyperspherical expansion and to obtain\nconverged values for \u300811Be|12Be\u3009 with high accuracy up to 30 fm. The n\u221210Be potential was\nfitted either to the experimental value of S1N (11Be), 496 keV, or to a much smaller value of 102\nkeV to check whether the effect from the nn correlations increases with weaker binding. In this\nparticular case, the nn potential was represented by just one Gaussian that gives a scattering\nlength of \u221220 fm. The three-body energies obtained for 12Be are shown in Table 1. The overlap\nintegrals \u300811Be|12Be\u3009, renormalized to unity, are plotted as ratios to their asymptotics in Fig.1a\n0 5 10 15 20\nr (fm)\n\u22121\n0\n1\n2\no\nve\nrla\np\/\nas\nym\npt\not\nics\n3\u2212body calculations\nstandard WS\n3\u2212body calculations\nstandard WS\nSn = 1.25 MeV\nSn = 0.56 MeV\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nr (fm)\n\u22122.0\n\u22121.0\n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\no\nve\nrla\np\/\nas\nym\npt\not\nics\n3\u2212body calculations\nstandard WS\nJpi(11Be) = 1\/2+\nJpi(11Be) = 1\/2\u2212\nJpi(11Be) = 5\/2+\nFigure 1.

Also, the r.m.s. radii of these overlaps are given in Table 1 in\ncomparison with standard values. The abnormal behaviour is clearly seen for both three-body\ncalculations and, as expected, the abnormalities are stronger for a smaller S1N (11Be). Fig.2\nshows effective local potentials (open circles) obtained by inversion of the two-body Schro\u00a8dinger\nequation. They can be fitted by a sum of two Woods-Saxon potentials one of which has unusually\nlarge diffuseness (see Table 2).\nRealistic 12Be. To take into account the deformation and the excitation of the 10Be core,\nwe have repeated the calculations from [5] for the case EXC1. The model space have been\nincreased up to Kmax = 34 which has provided a reasonable stability for the overlap \u300811Be|12Be\u3009\nat 5 \u2264 r \u2264 10 fm. The abnormal surface behaviour in \u300811Be|12Be\u3009 is seen for all three states\nof the 11Be residue (see Fig. 1b) and the effective local n\u221211Be potentials, the parameters of\nwhich are shown in Table 2, have long-range terms although their diffuseness are smaller than in\nthe pseudo 12Be case. The abnormalities arise due to the correlations between the two neutrons\nwhich are visualised in the plot of the wave function densities in Fig. 3. When the c.m. of two\nneutrons is far away from the 10Be core, the probability that these neutrons are close to each\nother is high.\nPseudo 9C. Our attempts to use the proper spin Jpi = 32\n\u2212for the 7Be core have been\nsuccessful only for small model spaces that cannot provide convergence for the overlap in the\nregion of interest. Therefore, we have used Jpi = 0+ for 7Be and neglected the p-7Be spin-orbit\ninteraction. This overbinds 9C but enables us to increase the model space up to Kmax = 50,\nthus providing high accuracy for \u30088B|9C\u3009 up to 20 fm. The overlap converges to its asymptotic\nform slower than in the standard case but not as slow as for 12Be. The two protons stay close\nto each other when both are far away from the 7Be core but the weight of this configuration is\nFigure 3. Probability densities of the wave functions obtained in three-body calculations for realistic\n12Be, 18Ne and pseudo 9C.\nsmaller than in 12Be (see Fig.3).\n18Ne. The 18Ne wave functions have been calculated for the ground and first excited 0+\nstates in a model space with Kmax = 50. The pp correlations outside the nuclear interior are\nclearly seen in the 18Ne wave function and the overlaps differ from the standard ones in the\nsurface region. However, this difference is much smaller than for 12Be, despite the long-range\ncharacter of the Coulomb force. The three-body dynamics results mainly in an increase of the\noverlap r.m.s. radius, which is stronger in the s-wave where the centrifugal barrier is absent.\n3. Non-standard overlaps in nuclear reactions\nNucleon knockout reactions have recently become a popular tool to determine spectroscopic\nfactors. We have calculated the cross sections and the parallel momentum distributions for\nTable 1.

The parallel momentum distributions from the three-body \u300811Be|12Be\u3009 overlap\nagree with those from the Woods-Saxon potential, provided they have the same r.m.s. radius.\nThe slow convergence of \u300811Be|12Be\u3009 to its asymptotic form cannot be seen in such an experiment.\nThe momentum distributions depend on the radius of the overlap and thus can be used to\ndetermine this if measured with high precision. The cross sections scale almost linearly with the\nr.m.s. radius of the overlap (see Fig.4) and, therefore, at these energies the effect from surface\nabnormalities in the \u300811Be|12Be\u3009 overlap manifests itself only as a change in the overall norm of\nthe calculated cross sections. This will therefore influence spectroscopic factors deduced from\ncomparisons between calculated and measured cross sections.\nTransfer reactions are sensitive to the surface part of the overlap and thus could be a good\ntool to study non-standard single-particle motion in the core+2N cluster systems.

Proton capture cross sections are often sensitive\nonly to the asymptotic region of the one-nucleon overlap and thus possible abnormal surface\nbehaviour will not influence energy dependence of such reactions. However, the contribution\nof the surface region to the neutron capture amplitude can be more important.

Challenges for theory and experiment\nThe exact dynamical three-body calculations have confirmed the possibility of slower radial\nconvergence of the one-nucleon overlaps to their asymptotic form in core+2N cluster systems due\nto the strong correlations between the two valence nucleons. This phenomenon has the strongest\neffect for final core+N systems in relative l = 0 states and when the Coulomb interaction is\nabsent. The non-standard behaviour has consequences for the determination of spectroscopic\nfactors from nucleon removal reactions and predictions of neutron capture rates on weakly-\nbound s-wave nuclei at stellar energies. Therefore, theory must make reliable predictions for\nnon-standard overlaps.\nThe main challenge for theory is to treat explicitly the three-body dynamics within a many-\nbody object. However, even when internal structure of the core is neglected, the model space,\nneeded to describe the nucleon motion at large distances in coupled-channel hyperspherical\ncalculations, becomes huge. Convergence accelerating methods should be developed to describe\nproperly the core deformation and excitations within the three-body model. Unsolved is the\nquestion of how antisymmetrisation influences non-standard behaviour of the overlap. The\nwidely used phenomenological shell model does not generate single-particle wave functions at\nall so no abnormalities can be seen there. No mean field based theory can reproduce this effect.\nOn the other hand, ab-initio approaches do not yet have sufficient accuracy to study such effects\nat large distances. For example, keeping in mind that to see unambiguously abnormalities at\n5 \u2264 r \u2264 10 fm in three-body calculations the Kmax should be at least 30, means that within\nmodels of the no-core shell model type at least 30 additional major shells are needed which do\nnot influence the total binding energy. This does not appear feasible at the moment. Three-\nbody dynamics can be included explicitly in microscopic cluster models by hand [6]. However,\nat present, such models can cope only with the simplest oscillator internal core structure and\nvery simple NN interactions.\nObservation of predicted three-body effects in one-nucleon overlaps can be a very difficult\ntask because such effects can be obscured by unsufficient knowledge of reaction mechanisms\nand uncertainties of other inputs to reaction amplitudes. However, unambigious experimental\nconfirmation either of their presence or absence is very important for our understanding of\nnuclear dynamics in near-drip line nuclei.\nThis work was performed under the UK grants EP\/C520521\/1 and EP\/E036627\/1 and in\nthe Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under DoE Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.\nReferences\n[1] Timofeyuk N K, Blokhintsev L D and Tostevin J A 2003 Phys.
