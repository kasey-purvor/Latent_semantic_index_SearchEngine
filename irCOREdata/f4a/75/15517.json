Originally discovered as an optical effect, it is\nactually more universal [2]; it has been observed in matter-\nwave interferometry experiments aiming to make precision\nmeasurements of rotation [3] and has even been proposed as a\nmethod of testing general relativity [4].\nAn attractive and theoretically simple geometry for ob-\nserving Sagnac-like effects in matter-waves is a ring trap,\nand with the excellent degree of control and precision now\navailable over magnetic and laser fields, the creation of such\ntraps has recently been achieved by a number of groups\nworldwide [5\u20138]. Recent experiments with Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BECs) in ring traps [5] show how the coherent\ntransfer of orbital angular momentum to a trapped BEC [9,10]\ncan induce long-lived superfluid flow. Two different flows\n(usually considered to be counterpropagating, although this\nis not strictly necessary\u2014as we show, one of the flows may,\nfor example, be zero) are required to observe the Sagnac\neffect in an atom-optical context. We show that there are\na number of advantages in using a two-component BEC\n[11], made up of a single atomic species with two relevant\ninternal states, particularly in ameliorating the frequently\nproblematic effects of atom-atom interactions. It is therefore\nnot necessary to assume negligible mean-field interactions [12]\nto cleanly observe the rotational response brought out by our\nproposed protocols. We describe how the accumulation of a\nSagnac phase can then be observed both through population\noscillations between the internal states and by precession of\ndensity fringes within a particular internal state. We show\nhow, in the case of density fringes, mean-field interactions\nfrom one component can stabilize the fringes in the other\nif the scattering lengths are approximately equal (as in, e.g.,\n87Rb [13]). Hence, within a mean-field picture, the repulsive\ninteractions can in principle be arbitrarily strong without\naffecting the interferometric signal. Finally, we discuss the\nsensitivity of our protocols.\nWe consider a two-component BEC composed of a single\nspecies with two relevant internal states, confined within an\naxially symmetric toroidal trapping potential considered to\nbe insensitive to the internal state [Fig. 1(a)]. We employ a\nmean-field treatment, describing the sample with two coupled\nGross-Pitaevskii equations:\nih\u00af\n\u2202\u0004j\n\u2202t\n=\n[\n\u2212h\u00af\n2\u22072\n2M\n+ V + (\u22121)j h\u00af\u03c9\n2\n+ 4\u03c0h\u00af\n2N\nM\n2\u2211\nk=1\najk|\u0004k|2\n]\n\u0004j, (1)\nwhere \u0004j (r) is the macroscopic wave function for atoms in\ninternal state j [normalized such that \u22112j=1 \u222b d3r|\u0004j (r)|2 =\n1], N is the total atom number, h\u00af\u03c9 is the energy difference\nbetween the two internal states, the ajk are the s-wave\nscattering lengths, and M is the atomic mass. In terms of\ncylindrical coordinates {r,\u03b8,z}, we take the confining potential\nto be V (r) = M[\u03c92r (r \u2212 \u03c1)2 + \u03c92zz2]\/2, with torus radius \u03c1\nand angular trapping frequencies\u03c9r ,\u03c9z. Assuming sufficiently\ntight radial and axial confinement, the dynamics in these di-\nrections are \u201cfrozen out,\u201d permitting a quasi-one-dimensional\n(1D) description [14,15] [see Fig. 1(b)]. Projecting out the {r,z}\ndependences and moving to a frame rotating counterclockwise\nabout the z axis with angular frequency \b transforms Eq.

Applying a resonant \u03c0\/2 pulse (a\n\u201csplitting\u201d pulse) to the internal two-state transition then yields\n\u0003\u03c8\u03c0\/2(\u03b8 ) = U\u03c0\/2 \u0003\u03c8I , where\n\u0003\u03c8\u03c0\/2(\u03b8 ) = 1\n2\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n(1\n1\n)\n, U\u03c0\/2 = 1\u221a\n2\n(1 1\n1 \u22121\n)\n.

A free evolution f (T\/2) follows\n[f (t) denotes an evolution governed by Eq. (2) for a time t ,\nand T\/2 is half the total interrogation time]. As the atom fields\nhave uniform density, this takes a very simple form:\n\u0003\u03c8T\/2(\u03b8 ) = e\n\u2212i\u03d51T\/2eim(\u03b8+\bT\/2)\n2\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n(\nei\u03d52T\/2ei\u000b(\u03b8+\bT\/2)\ne\u2212i\u03d52T\/2e\u2212i\u000b(\u03b8+\bT\/2)\n)\n, (6)\nwhere \u03d51 = (m2 + \u000b2)\/2 + (g11 + 2g12 + g22)\/8\u03c0 and \u03d52 =\n\u03c9\/2 \u2212 2m\u000b + (g22 \u2212 g11)\/8\u03c0 . We apply a \u03c0 pulse U\u03c0 , which\nswaps the two components, and allow another free evolution\nf (T\/2) (completing the total interrogation time T ). This\nnegates the accumulated relative phase described by \u03d52,\nproducing\n\u0003\u03c8T (\u03b8 ) = e\n\u2212i\u03d51T eim(\u03b8+\bT )\n2\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n(\ne\u2212i\u000b(\u03b8+\bT )\nei\u000b(\u03b8+\bT )\n)\n. (7)\nWe repeat the angular-momentum-imprinting procedure U\u000bm,\nwhich, due to the application of U\u03c0 at t = T\/2, undoes the\nrelative difference in angular momentum between the spatial\nmodes associated with the two internal states. Following this\nby a second \u03c0\/2 pulse (a \u201crecombination\u201d pulse) produces\n\u0003\u03c8R(\u03b8 ) = U\u03c0\/2U\u000bm \u0003\u03c8T (\u03b8 ), where\n\u0003\u03c8R(\u03b8 ) = e\n\u2212i\u03d51T eim(2\u03b8+\bT )\u221a\n2\u03c0\n(\ncos(\u000b\bT )\n\u2212i sin(\u000b\bT )\n)\n, (8)\nand there is no subsequent change to the pop-\nulations.

Note that the same response is obtained when\nangular momentum is imprinted on \u03c81 only (m = \u000b) as\nfor the symmetric case (m = 0). It is thus not essential to\nimprint angular momentum on both components, permitting a\nsignificant experimental simplification.\nAlternatively, we may omit the second application of U\u000bm,\ninstead applying U\u03c0\/2 directly to \u0003\u03c8T (\u03b8 ) to produce\n\u0003\u03c8R\u2032(\u03b8 ) = e\n\u2212i\u03d51T eim(\u03b8+\bT )\u221a\n2\u03c0\n(\ncos(\u000b[\u03b8 + \bT ])\n\u2212i sin(\u000b[\u03b8 + \bT ])\n)\n.

Hence, measurable\ninformation about \b can be obtained without repeated angular\nmomentum imprinting. If the measurement is not immediate,\nhowever, the \u03c8j (\u03b8 ) continue to evolve.

Note that |\u03c82(\u03b8 )|2 is identical except for a\u03c0 shift in \u03b8 , and\nfinite \b causes the densities to precess by \u0001\u03b8 = \bt . All quantities\nare dimensionless.\nwhere the phases simplify to \u03d51 = (m2 + \u000b2)\/2 + g\/2\u03c0 and\n\u03d52 = \u03c9\/2 \u2212 2m\u000b. Hence, if the gjk are equal, the fringes in\nthe two components stabilize each other, simply precessing\naround the ring with rate \b \u2212 m. Note also that the density\nfringes yielded by an SF (T ) \u2261 f (T )U\u03c0\/2U\u000bmU\u03c0\/2 sequence\nare identical to those from a U\u03c0\/2f (T\/2)U\u03c0f (T\/2)U\u000bmU\u03c0\/2\nsequence when m = 0 [16] [see Fig. 2(b)].\nIf the gjk are not equal, the fringe pattern can be strongly\ndisrupted, as shown in Fig. 3. The scattering lengths can be\nvery similar; in the case of 87Rb, if we consider F = 2,mF = 1\nto be internal state 1 and F = 1, mF = \u22121 to be internal\nstate 2, then, in Bohr radii, a11 = 95.47, a12 = 98.09, and\na22 = 100.44 [13]. Numerical results for an SF (T ) sequence\nfor various T , with g11 = 974, g12 = 1000, g22 = 1024, \u000b =\n1, m = 0, are shown in Fig. 2(b). The gjk correspond to an\n87Rb configuration with, for example, \u03c1 = 10\u22125 m, \u03c9r = \u03c9z =\n2\u03c0 \u00d7 400 Hz, and N = 2800, which is consistent with current\nexperimental capabilities [5] and for which the fringe profiles\nare only slightly perturbed [17].\nTemporarily restricting ourselves to \b = 0, we note\nthat Eq. (2) preserves initial periodic symmetry [\u03c8j (\u03b8 ) =\n\u03c8j (\u03b8 + 2\u03c0\/\u000b)] and reflection symmetry [e.g., \u03c8j (\u03b8 ) =\n(\u22121)j+1\u03c8j (\u2212\u03b8 )] and that, if \u03c8j (\u03b8,t) form a solution to\nEq. (2), then e\u2212im2t\/2eim\u03b8\u03c8j (\u03b8 \u2212 mt,t) also form a solution.\nFurthermore, if \u03c8j (\u03b8,t) form a solution to Eq. (2) when \b = 0,\nthen \u03c8j (\u03b8 + \bt,t) form a solution to Eq. (2) when \b \u0006= 0.\nHence, as long as the fringes remain resolvable [i.e., do not\nbreak up, as, for example, in Fig. 3(d)], the fringe peaks\nprecess with rate \b \u2212 m, and their form is independent of\nboth \b and m. We may therefore set \b = 0, m = 0 when\nconsidering the degree of fringe stabilization for unequal\ngjk numerically. In Fig. 4, for \u000b = 1, we see that there\nis a broad region in parameter space exhibiting substantial\nstabilization, and Figs. 4(b) and 4(c) show the 87Rb parameter\nregime to be comfortably contained within this region.

All quantities are dimension-\nless, and the maximum possible F (t) is 0.5.\nresult also indicates robustness to a comparable difference\nin the local particle densities of the two internal states\ndue to nonidentical trapping potentials. Different stability\nregimes, and the rich dynamics shown in Fig. 3, could also\nbe explored experimentally with the aid of a suitable Feshbach\nresonance [18].\nAs each atom is in a superposition state of the two internal\nstates, measuring the spatial distribution of atoms in, for\nexample, state 1 will on average project N\/2 atoms into\nthat internal state, with variance N\/4. Hence, the standard\ndeviation relative to N is 1\/2\n\u221a\nN , which can be considered\nnegligible to the Gross-Pitaevskii level of approximation.\nAn ideal in situ density measurement [6] specific to one\ninternal state destroys the coherence between the internal\nstates but will in principle not affect the classical fields\ndescribing the positional states of the two components. The\ntime evolutions of the two components are still governed\nby Eq. (2), and so, evolving Eq. (10), \u03c81(\u03b8,t) and \u03c82(\u03b8,t)\ncontinue to evolve according to Eq. (11) for the ideal g11 =\ng12 = g22 case [19]. Consequently, assuming ideal, nonde-\nstructive measurements and g11 \u2248 g12 \u2248 g22, the dynamics\ndue to \b \u0006= 0 may be tracked through repeated measurements\nwithin the same experimental run. Specifically, the fringe\npositions can be \u201czeroed\u201d with a first measurement, and\nany subsequent precession monitored by later measurements.\nFinally, we note that, although we have assumed perfect\naxial symmetry throughout, we do not expect the effect of\nany potential asymmetries or corrugations to be significant if\ntheir scale is smaller than that set by the condensate chemical\npotential [5].\nFor an optical Sagnac interferometer, the fringe shift\nrelative to the fringe width \u03b4L = 4A\b\/\u03bbLc is commonly taken\nas a measure of the rotational sensitivity, where A is the\ninterferometer\u2019s enclosed area, \u03bbL is the optical wavelength,\n061602-3\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nP. L. HALKYARD, M. P. A. JONES, AND S. A. GARDINER PHYSICAL REVIEW A 81, 061602(R) (2010)\nand c is the speed of light [1]. The relevant angular shift of\nthe spatial fringes we consider is \u0001\u03b8 = \bT , and the fringe\nwidths scale as w = \u03c0\/2\u000b; hence, \u03b4 \u2261 \u0001\u03b8\/w = 2\u000b\bT\/\u03c0 . In\nthe population-based protocol, \u03b4 gives the number of instances\nthe population alternates between 0 and N over a range [0,T ]\nof interrogation times. It is instructive to now consider a\nmore typical simple Mach-Zehnder (MZ) configuration [20].\nThe de Broglie relations then yield for atoms of momentum\np a wavelength \u03bb = h\/p and velocity v = p\/M , and hence\n\u03b4MZ = 4A\bM\/h. Sensitivity of response therefore appears\nentirely determined by the enclosed area A, as opposed to\nthe interrogation time T of our protocols. The time taken\nbetween the wave packet splitting and its recombination in\nfact sets a natural time scale; in a ring geometry, this is\ngiven by T1 = \u03c0\u03c1\/v, which, using v = h\u00af\u000b\/\u03c1M and A =\n\u03c0\u03c12, becomes T1 = (AM\/h)(2\u03c0\/\u000b). Hence, we may rephrase\n\u03b4MZ = 2\u000b\bT1\/\u03c0 , which differs from \u03b4 principally in that the\ntime T1 at which it is possible to extract useful information\nis fully determined by A and p, rather than being a free\nparameter [21]. In an MZ configuration [20] we expect v to\nbe greater than that corresponding to small \u000b in, for example,\na \u03c1 = 10\u22125 m toroidal trap [5], implying moderate T1 for\nrelatively large \u03c1. Our proposal is advantageous in using an\nintense, monochromatic source, where the usual associated\nissues of interatomic interactions have been circumvented and\nwhere potentially useful information may be extracted at any\ntime T . Large values of \u000b [12], although more challenging to\ngenerate, will also enhance the rotational response. Large \u03c1\nand N will aid in imaging; we note that ring traps of radius \u03c1 =\n4.8 cm [7] and 87Rb condensates with N \u223c 106 are achievable.\nThe atomic shot noise also places a fundamental limit on\nthe precision with which the spatial fringes or population\noscillations can be measured, and hence \b inferred.\nIn conclusion, we have considered the rotational dynamics\nof a single-species BEC, with two relevant internal states,\nwithin a ring-trap configuration and in a rotating frame. We\nhave proposed a Sagnac-like interferometric protocol where\nthe rotational sensing is manifest as time-dependent population\noscillations, in a way that is insensitive to the atom-atom\ninteractions arising within a mean-field picture. Simpler\nprotocols involve observing the precession of density fringes\naround the ring. The fringes are robust for approximately\nequal interaction strengths (e.g., 87Rb), and a range of striking\ndynamics may also be observed by tuning the interactions with\nFeshbach resonances. All of these phenomena are observable\nwithin the range of recent experimental advances.\nWe thank K. Helmerson, W. D. Phillips, S. L. Cornish,\nA. Gauguet, and I. G.
