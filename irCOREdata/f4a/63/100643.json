INTRODUCTION\nDoubly-magic nuclei are key benchmarks to our under-\nstanding of nuclear shell structure. Until experiments around\n100Sn become feasible, 56Ni is the heaviest experimentally\naccessible doubly-magic nucleus in which protons and neu-\ntrons occupy the same orbitals. An early neutron-pickup\nexperiment populating states in 57Ni suggested that the low-\nlying excited states may not be purely single-particle in nature\nbut may include contributions from 56Ni excited states [1]. The\n\u03b2-decay of 57Cu indicated [2] that the Gamov-Teller matrix\nelement of its decay to the ground state of 57Ni is significantly\nreduced compared to the single-particle value. Measurements\nof unusually high collectivity of 56Ni [3\u20135] reinforced the\nquestions about the single-particle character of the ground and\nlowest excited states of 57Ni. The spectroscopic factors for the\nfirst three states of 57Ni were measured in a (d, p) transfer\nreaction at low energy [6]. In contrast to the indications of\ncollectivity from the measured 56Ni B(E2) excitation strength,\nthe transfer experiment indicated that the first three states of\n57Ni are almost pure single-particle states.\nPickup and stripping reactions and extraction of spectro-\nscopic factors can be used to resolve the nature of 56Ni and\nthe single-particle character of 57Cu and 57Ni. The accuracy\nof spectroscopic factors measured in this mass region via\nlow-energy transfer reactions is limited by the lack of good\noptical model potential parameters. In experiments performed\nat high energies, analyses based on the sudden approximation\nand eikonal theory [7,8] are applicable and thus the model\ndependency is reduced. The corresponding experimental tech-\nnique is one-nucleon knockout in inverse kinematics, a method\n\u2217Present address: Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia,\nIL 60510-0500.\n\u2020Present address: Institut fu\u00a8r Kernphysik, Technische Universita\u00a8t\nDarmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany.\n\u2021Electronic address: glasmacher@nscl.msu.edu\n\u00a7Present address: Universita di Basilicata, Italy.\n\u2016Present address: GANIL, Boite Postale 5027, F-14076, Caen\nCedex, France.\nwhich has been used to measure single-particle configurations\nover a range of nuclei since its development as a spectroscopic\ntool [9\u201313]. In this method, single-particle spectroscopy on the\nnucleus of interest is performed by extracting the following\nquantities: partial cross sections to ground and excited states\nof the knockout residues; the spectroscopic factors for the\nremoval of a nucleon from a specific single-particle orbit of the\nprojectile; and the orbital angular momentum of the removed\nnucleon. Measurements are performed in inverse kinematics\nat beam energies of greater than 50 MeV\/nucleon.\nIn previous one-nucleon knockout experiments on well-\nbound nuclei, a reduction in measured spectroscopic strength\nwith respect to shell-model predictions has been observed. The\nresulting reduction factor Rs , the ratio of experimental and\ntheoretical spectroscopic strength, is 0.5\u20130.7 for one-proton\nand one-neutron knockout from stable 12C and 16O [14] and\nfor one-neutron removal from well-bound N = 16 isotones\n[11] but closer to unity for one-proton knockout from the\nlighter weakly proton-bound nuclei 8B, 9C [15] and for the\none-neutron knockout from the weakly neutron-bound 15C to\nthe ground state of 14C [12]. Recently, a pronounced reduction\nof 0.24(4) has been observed in the one-neutron removal\nfrom 32Ar [13], the most deeply-bound neutron system studied\nso far.\nII. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS\nIn the technique of one-nucleon knockout, the measured\ncross sections are used to derive the one-nucleon removal\nspectroscopic factors via an extension of the eikonal model [8].\nThe cross section \u03c3 to a specific final state of the knockout\nresidue (core) is related to the spectroscopic factor via\n\u03c3exp =\n\u2211\nj\nC2Sexp(nlj )\u03c3sp(Sn, nlj ), (1)\n\u03c3th =\n\u2211\nj\n(\nA\nA \u2212 1\n)N\nC2SSM(nlj )\u03c3sp(Sn, nlj ), (2)\nwhere the sum is taken over all non-vanishing nucleon-core\nconfigurations.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 74, 024304 (2006)\nthe removal of a nucleon with given single-particle quantum\nnumbers nlj. The factor [(A\/(A \u2212 1))N ] is a center-of-mass\ncorrection that has to be applied if spectroscopic factors are\ntaken from shell model to obtain a theoretical cross section.\nIn the center-of-mass correction, A is the mass number of the\ninitial nucleus and N is the main harmonic oscillator quantum\nnumber associated with the relevant major shell [14]. The\nspectroscopic factor depends on the structure of the nucleus,\nwhereas the single-particle cross section \u03c3sp comes from\nreaction theory, assuming unit single-particle strength.\nThe single-particle cross sections are highly dependent on\nthe nucleon separation energy Sn,p and the orbital angular\nmomentum l of the removed nucleon. These were calculated\nin the eikonal model and include contributions from both the\nstripping and diffraction processes [8]. The removed-neutron\nwave functions in the 57Ni ground state were calculated in\nWoods-Saxon potential wells with a diffuseness 0.7 fm. Their\nradius parameters were chosen so that the rms radius of each\nneutron orbital was consistent with those from a Skyrme SKX\nHartree-Fock (HF) [16] calculation for 57Ni when the depth\nof the Woods-Saxon potential was adjusted to reproduce the\neffective separation energy. The measured separation energy\nof Sn = 10.247 MeV [17] was used for the p3\/2 state and an\neffective separation energy of 14 MeV was estimated from the\ncentroid of the p3\/2f7\/2 multiplet for the f7\/2 level. The orbital\nrms radii were assumed to be 4.14 and 4.17 fm for the p3\/2\nand f7\/2 levels. The 56Ni neutron and proton densities were\nalso taken from HF, resulting in a rms matter radius of 3.64 fm\nfor 56Ni, consistent with 56Fe. A Gaussian matter distribution\nwas assumed for the 9Be target with an rms matter radius of\n2.36 fm.\nExcited levels of 56Ni and associated spectroscopic factors\nwere calculated in the many-body shell model [18,19] using\nthe FPD6 effective interaction [20]. For 57Ni, the \u03bd(f7\/2)\nand \u03c0 (f7\/2) closed shells plus one neutron in the p3\/2 orbit\nwere assumed. For 56Ni, calculations were performed with the\n\u03bd(f7\/2) and \u03c0 (f7\/2) closed shells for the ground state, and for\nthe excited states \u03c0 (f7\/2)8 and \u03bd(f7\/2)7 with the p3\/2, f5\/2, and\np1\/2 neutron shells active. In this approach, the spectroscopic\nfactor for the removal of a neutron from thep3\/2 orbit leading to\nthe ground state of 56Ni is C2SSM = 1 and the spectroscopic\nfactors for removing a neutron from f7\/2 summed over all\nfinal excited states of 56Ni (T = 0 and T = 1) is C2SSM = 8.\nConsidering the calculated energy levels of 56Ni, we predict\n7.36 of this to be below the proton separation energy.\nThe shape of the measured parallel momentum distribution\nof the 56Ni residues is used to assign the orbital angular\nmomentum for the removed nucleon. The theoretical parallel\nmomentum distributions were calculated in a black-disk\nmodel [7], core-target collisions at small impact parameters\n(<7.2 fm) being assumed to result in fragmentation of the\ncore. Interaction radii were chosen to reproduce the reaction\ncross sections of the free constituents.\nIII. EXPERIMENT AND DATA ANALYSIS\nThe experiment was performed at the National Super-\nconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). Acceleration of\na beam of stable 58Ni to an energy of 105 MeV\/nucleon\nand an intensity of 2 pnA was carried out in the K1200\ncyclotron of the NSCL. The 58Ni beam was incident on\na 249 mg\/cm2 9Be production target. The A1200 fragment\nseparator [21] was used to select a secondary beam of 57Ni with\nan energy of 73 MeV\/nucleon, an intensity of approximately\n30,000 particles\/s and a momentum spread of 0.5%. A\n56.1 mg\/cm2 9Be target was located at the center of an array\nof 38 position-sensitive NaI(Tl) detectors [22] at the entrance\nto the S800 spectrograph [23]. Gamma rays were measured\nin coincidence with the knockout residues detected by the\nS800 focal-plane detector system [24]. The identification of the\n56Ni fragments was performed with energy loss and position\ninformation measured with the S800 spectrograph focal-plane\ndetectors and using the time of flight taken between plastic\nscintillators at the exit of the A1200 fragment separator and\nthe S800 focal plane (see Fig. 1).\nFIG. 1. (Color online) Particle identification in the S800 focal\nplane. The upper panel shows the energy loss measured in the\nionization chamber versus the time of flight taken between two\nplastic scintillators for the unreacted beam (top) and the setting with\nthe spectrograph centered on the one-neutron removal (bottom). The\nlower panel shows the correlation between the energy loss and the\nx-position (dispersive) in the focal plane. In this spectrum, a beam\nblocker had been inserted at the high-momentum side to block the\ntail of the unreacted 57Ni beam. 56Ni and 57Ni isotopes can be clearly\nseparated. The x-position relates to the parallel momentum.\n024304-2\nONE-NEUTRON KNOCKOUT FROM 57Ni PHYSICAL REVIEW C 74, 024304 (2006)\n12\n24\nke\nV\n27\n01\nke\nV17\n26\nke\nV\n10\n10\nke\nV\n22\n34\nke\nV\n13\n79\nke\nV\n30\n27\nke\nV\nEnergy (keV)\nCo\nun\nts\n\/(2\n0k\neV\n)\n1\n10\n10 2\n10 3\n10 4\n500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000\n0\n2700.6(4)\n3925.1(4)\n4935.5(6)\n5661(72)\n0+\n2+\n4+\n(3 )+\n(2 ,3 ,4 ,5 )+ + + +\n270\n0.6(\n3)\n122\n4.5(\n2)\n101\n0.4(\n4)\n223\n4.5(\n7)\n172\n6(1\n0)\n302\n7(7\n1)\nE(keV)J \u03c0\nFIG. 2.

The solid black line is the fit to the\nexperimental spectrum containing the sum of the simulated response\nfunctions for seven \u03b3 -ray peaks (solid gray lines) and a double-\nexponential coincident background (dashed line), assumed to arise\nfrom excitations of the target. The inset shows a partial decay scheme\nfor 56Ni with a new proposed level at 5661(72) keV.\nAfter the 56Ni residues from one-neutron knockout were\nunambiguously identified, the coincident \u03b3 -ray spectrum was\nanalyzed. Only the inner ring of 11 NaI(Tl) detectors [22] was\nused in this experiment. GEANT [25] simulations successfully\nmodeled the \u03b3 -ray spectrum and the detector response.\nSimulations and experimental efficiencies measured with\nstandard calibration sources agreed within 7.5%. The Doppler-\nreconstructed (\u03b2 = 0.36) \u03b3 -ray spectrum in coincidence with\n56Ni fragments is shown in Fig. 2. The analytical curves, which\nwere fitted to the simulated spectra and subsequently scaled to\nfit the experimental spectrum, can be seen as solid gray lines.\nThe dashed line indicates the prompt, coincident background,\ndescribed in this experiment by a double exponential curve. A\nsimilar background has been observed in previous knockout\nexperiments [26\u201328], where it has been attributed to neutrons,\n\u03b3 rays, and charged particles interacting with the experimental\napparatus and scintillators. The background determined for\nthis experiment was 67% to 85% higher than that quoted for\nknockout on Si and S [29]. There may be evidence for an\nincrease in coincident background with mass number or\nbinding energy of the knocked-out nucleons.\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA simplified level scheme including all \u03b3 -ray transitions\nobserved in this experiment is shown in the inset of Fig. 2.\nThe placement of the 1726(10) and 3027(71) keV \u03b3 rays in\ncoincidence with the 1224.5(7) and 2700.6(3) keV \u03b3 rays\nresulted in a level at 5661(72) keV. A 5668 keV level and\nassociated 1744 keV de-excitation \u03b3 ray were observed in\n1985 [30] and reported without uncertainty. Although an\nangular momentum assignment of J\u03c0 = 6+ was proposed for\nthe 5668 keV level, only J\u03c0 = 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+, are expected to\nbe populated via the one-neutron knockout mechanism\nbecause of angular momentum considerations. No placement\nin the proposed level scheme was possible for the \u03b3 ray\nobserved at 1379(10) keV.\nThe proton separation energy for 56Ni [Sp =\n7.165(11) MeV] is significantly higher than the energy\nof the highest excited state observed in this experiment.\nAlthough excited states up to an energy of 7900 keV were\npredicted in a shell-model calculation, no higher-lying excited\nstates could be identified experimentally above 5661 keV.\nLow statistics at high \u03b3 -ray energies contributed to the\ndifficulty in resolving any transitions above 3100 keV.\nTherefore the branching ratios to the individual excited\nstates of 56Ni were not calculated because of the possibility\nof indirect feeding from higher-lying, unobserved excited\nstates.\nThe parallel momentum distributions of the 56Ni knockout\nresidues were determined using the reconstructed scattering\nangle and fractional kinetic energy after the target, the\nmomentum (20.26 GeV\/c) and beam velocity \u03b2 = 0.36 at the\npoint of the \u03b3 -ray emission, and the mass of the fragments.\nBecause of the complexity of the \u03b3 -ray spectrum of 56Ni, it\nwas not possible to isolate momentum distributions associated\nwith individual final excited states. Instead, the momentum\ndistributions associated with the knockout to all excited states\nand the ground state of 56Ni were reconstructed from the\nmeasured momenta in coincidence and anti-coincidence with\ndetected \u03b3 rays. The coincident (C) and anti-coincident (A)\nspectra shown in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively, can be written\nin terms of the momentum distributions to the ground state\n(Sg.s.) and all excited states (Sexc) of 56Ni as\nSexc(p\u2016) = 1\n\u0006\n[\nC(p\u2016) \u2212 \u03b41 \u2212 \u03b4A(p\u2016)\n]\nSg.s.(p\u2016) =\n[\n1 + \u03b4\n\u0006(1 \u2212 \u03b4)\n] [\nA(p\u2016) \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b4)(1 \u2212 \u0006)\n\u0006 + \u03b4 \u2212 \u0006\u03b4 C(p\u2016)\n]\n.\n(3)\nThe average efficiency \u03b5 for the NaI(Tl) array is expected\nto be approximately 50% for an average \u03b3 -ray cascade of\ntwo, but was varied in the analysis to determine the best\nseparation between Sg.s. and Sexc. The probability that a \u03b3\nray not originating from the de-excitation of a knockout\nresidue would be detected in coincidence with that fragment\nin the S800 focal plane is \u03b4. For this experiment, a value of\n\u03b4 = 0.1 was chosen, in agreement with previous experiments\nthat determined a \u03b3 -ray background of 10% per fragment.\nThe background appears to be higher in this experiment than\nthe 10% assumed in experiments on lighter nuclei. However,\nwith this choice of \u03b4, a consistent separation of the ground\nstate and excited state events was obtained with a choice of\n024304-3\nK. L. YURKEWICZ et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 74, 024304 (2006)\nFIG. 3. Parallel momentum distributions associated with 56Ni\ndetected at the S800 focal plane. The distribution associated with 56Ni\nfragments in coincidence with all \u03b3 rays between 250 and 7000 keV is\nshown in (a) and that associated with all remaining 56Ni fragments in\n(b). The distribution associated with knockout to all excited states of\n56Ni is shown in (d) and that to the ground state in (c). The distributions\nin (c) and (d) were constructed assuming an average efficiency for the\nNaI(Tl) array of \u0006 = 0.55 and a background probability of \u03b4 = 0.1\n(see text for details).\n\u0006 = 0.55. Thus the higher background used in the fit to the\n\u03b3 -ray spectrum in this experiment may be a result of multiple\n\u03b3 rays that could not be resolved because of the level density\nand low statistics at high energies. A 3.5% systematic error\non the number of counts was included in the calculation of\nexperimental cross sections because of the choice of the two\nparameters \u0006 and \u03b4. The resulting momentum distributions\nassociated with the ground state and all excited states of 56Ni\nare shown in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d). The errors shown include\nboth statistical uncertainties and the systematic error from the\nchoice of \u0006 and \u03b4. A similar analysis has been performed for\nthe one-nucleon removal reactions on sd shell nuclei [31].\nThe shell model predicts that one-neutron removal to the\nground state would be associated with an l = 1 distribution,\nbecause of the removal of the 1p3\/2 valence neutron. Similarly,\none-neutron removal to the excited states of 56Ni would\ncorrespond to an l = 3 momentum distribution because of\nthe orbital angular momentum carried by a neutron removed\nfrom the 0f7\/2 shell. The ground state distribution shown\nin Fig. 3(c) is well described by an l = 1 theoretical curve\ncentered at 20.42 GeV\/c. The distribution associated with\nknockout to the excited states of the 56Ni fragments, shown\nin Fig. 3(d) is consistent with the theoretical curve for\nl = 3 with a low-momentum excess extending to approxi-\nmately 20 GeV\/c. This low-momentum tail as seen around\n20.25 GeV\/c in the excited-state momentum distribution\n[Fig. 3(d)] has been reported in several previous one-nucleon\nknockout experiments [26,29,32,33]. Tostevin [34] has\nshown that the asymmetric shape as observed for the knockout\nreactions on the halo nuclei 11Be and 15C can be reproduced\nby using a proper dynamical treatment of continuum-coupling\neffects in the diffractive channel of the knockout process.\nHowever, the same explanation is unlikely to hold for the\nwell-bound 57Ni. The present observation is very similar\nto the pronounced tail at low momentum reported in the\none-neutron knockout from 46Ar to the 7\/2\u2212 ground state of\n45Ar [33], where this asymmetry is discussed in the framework\nof deviations from eikonal theory.\nThe inclusive cross section \u03c3incl was calculated from the\nnumber of 56Ni fragments detected in the spectrograph focal\nplane relative to the number of incident 57Ni projectiles,\nnormalized to the number of target nuclei. The inclusive\ncross section was calculated run by run, and the average for\nthe three runs closest to the unreacted 57Ni normalization\nrun was used to determine \u03c3incl = 41.4(12) mb. The partial\ncross sections to all excited states and the ground state of\n56Ni were determined using the same method as for the\nparallel momentum distributions. This resulted in branches\nof 81.3(35)% to all excited states and 18.7(35)% to the ground\nstate, corresponding to a partial cross section to the ground\nstate of 7.7(15) mb and to all excited states of 33.7(17) mb.\nThe calculated stripping and diffraction components for\nthe single-particle cross sections to the ground state and\nTABLE I.

As expected for\n57Ni, a semi-magic nucleus with only one neutron outside\nthe doubly-magic N = Z = 28 core, the shell model correctly\npredicts the angular momentum of the knocked-out neutron\nfor the ground-state configuration, shown by the good fit\nof the l = 1 shape to the momentum distribution associated\nwith the 56Ni ground state. Although the orbital angular\nmomentum of knocked-out neutrons populating excited states\nof 56Ni could not be well determined, a value of at least\nl = 3 should be assigned. The measured partial and inclusive\ncross sections, however, do not show good agreement with\ntheory. The measured cross section to the ground state is\n55(11)% of the theoretical ground-state cross section. The\nmeasured cross section to all excited states amounts to 47(2)%\nof the shell-model sum-rule theoretical cross section, and the\ninclusive cross section is 48(2)% of the theoretical inclusive\ncross section. The reduction in cross section translates into a\nreduction in measured spectroscopic strength relative to the\nshell model.\nSeveral studies have been performed recently to explore this\nreduction in spectroscopic strength observed in one-nucleon\nremoval experiments [11\u201315,33]. Proton removal from inelas-\ntic electron scattering has been considered the standard for the\ndetermination of absolute spectroscopic factors. It was shown\nthat deduced spectroscopic factors from (e, e\u2032p) experiments\nfor nuclei from mass 12 to 208 exhaust only about 60% of\nthe single-particle shell model prediction [37\u201339]. Electron\nscattering data are available only for stable nuclei, and it is not\npossible to probe neutron occupancies within this approach. In\ncontrast, the technique of one-nucleon knockout can be used\nto probe both proton and neutron occupancies in radioactive\nnuclei as well as stable species. It then becomes of interest\nto compare the spectroscopic factors deduced via one-proton\nknockout reactions to those from electron scattering. Brown\net al. [14] compared theoretical cross sections calculated in the\neikonal model with experimental cross sections from a series of\none-nucleon knockout experiments. To facilitate a comparison\nbetween experiments, the reduction factor Rs was defined\nas the ratio between the experimental and theoretical cross\nsections. One-proton knockout on the stable nuclei 12C and\n16O resulted in Rs values of 0.53(2) and 0.68(4), in agreement\nwith the reduction factors deduced from the electron scattering\nexperiments. One-neutron knockout from the same two stable\nnuclei yielded Rs values of 0.49(2) and 0.56(3), suggesting\nthat one-neutron knockout experiments measure the same\nquantity as one-proton knockout and thus can also be used\nto measure absolute spectroscopic factors. The reduction in\nsingle-particle strength observed in the case of the radioactive\nnucleus 57Ni is comparable to the reductions obtained for\nthe single-neutron knockout of the two stable nuclei 12C and\n16O [14] (see Fig. 4), consistent with the reduction observed in\nthe one-neutron knockout on well-bound N = 16 isotones [11]\nand agrees with the quenching of single-particle strengths\n1000 2000500200\nBeam Energy (MeV\/nucleon)\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n \nR\ned\nuc\ntio\nn\nFa\nct\nor\nR\nS\n2000\n12C\n0p 0p\n10050 10050\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n57Ni\n1p3\/2 0f7\/2\nNeutron knockout\nProton knockout\n57Ni16O\nFIG. 4.

[14]\nfrom measurements performed at the Lawrence Berkeley National\nLaboratory [35,36].\nobserved for stable nuclei in electron scattering experiments\n[37\u201339].\nIt is suggested [13,15,37,39] that correlation effects (short-\nrange, long-range, and tensor nucleon-nucleon interactions)\nthat are absent from or only approximately treated in effective-\ninteraction theory may explain some of the observed reduction\nin spectroscopic strength. Those correlations result in physical\nnucleon occupancies being reduced and spectroscopic strength\nshifted to higher energies; see Refs. [37,39]. For example,\nthe repulsive short-range part of the interaction becomes\nimportant at distances of less than 0.4 fm and leads to high-\nmomentum components in the nucleon wave function [37].\nThe importance of the coupling to surface phonons and giant\nresonances as contribution to the reduction has been discussed\nin Ref. [39].\nIn summary, spectroscopic factors for one-neutron removal\nfrom 57Ni to the ground and all observed excited states of\n56Ni have been measured at 73 MeV\/nucleon. The l = 1\ncharacter of the 57Ni ground state and the l = 3 character\nof the first few excited states have been confirmed. The\nlevel scheme of 56Ni was extended to include a level at\n5661(72) keV, with two de-excitation \u03b3 rays. Finally, the\nphenomenon of a reduction in the measured spectroscopic\nstrengths, as compared to shell-model predictions, has been\nconfirmed in the exotic, doubly-magic 56Ni\u2014the heaviest\nnucleus yet measured via one-nucleon knockout. The ob-\nserved inclusive cross section for knockout to 56Ni was\n48(2)% of the predicted shell-model value, in agreement\nwith the reductions typically observed in stable, well-bound\nnuclei.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the National Science Founda-\ntion under grants PHY-0110253 and PHY-0244453 and by the\nUnited Kingdom Engineering and Physical Sciences Research\nCouncil (EPSRC) under grant EP\/D003628.\n024304-5\nK.
