In his theo-\nretical writings on the theatre, as well as in\nhis moral weeklies, Die Vern\u00fcnftigen Tadler-\ninnen and Der Biedermann, he criticized most\nof all the integral role played by the comic\nfigure who under various names \u2013 Hans-\nwurst, Harlekin, Pickelhering, et al.3 \u2013 dis-\nrupted the \u2018Haupt- und Staatsaktionen\u2019 with\nhis crude jokes and mockery of the aristo-\ncratic ideal heroes.\nThe Neubers for their part were driven in\nequal measure by their own reforming ideals\nand by the need to survive the tough com-\npetition in a landscape of travelling theatre\ntroupes. Karoline Neuber was not without\nulterior motives when she joined Gottsched\nin the fight against a stage dominated by\nHarlequin and Hanswurst: her strongest\ncompetitor in the struggle for performing\nprivileges was Joseph Ferdinand M\u00fcller, a\nfamous Hanswurst performer. The united\ncampaign against the comic fool reached its\nculmination in the symbolic \u2018banishment\u2019 or\nexpulsion of 1737, which took the form of a\n124 ntq 23:2 (may 2007) \u00a9 cambridge university press doi: 10.1017\/s0266464x07000036\nKaren J\u00fcrs-Munby\nHanswurst and Herr Ich: Subjection\nand Abjection in Enlightenment\nCensorship of the Comic Figure\nThe well-known \u2018banishment\u2019 of the popular comic figure Hanswurst from the German\nstage by Gottsched and the Neuber acting troupe in the early eighteenth century is\nusually read as part of the historical movement from improvised folk theatre to bourgeois\nliterary theatre. In this article Karen J\u00fcrs-Munby goes beyond that received wisdom to\ndiscuss what kind of acting, what kind of body, and what kind of relationship between\nstage and audience were censored by banishing Hanswurst. Considering this censorship as\npart of the larger historical relationship between discourses on acting and the emergence\nof a modern self in the Enlightenment, she argues that the osmotic body and stage that\nHanswurst stood for prevented the aesthetic mirroring relationship sought by eighteenth-\ncentury stage reformers in an increasing need for bourgeois self-representation. The\nHanswurst banishment can be theorized with reference to Julia Kristeva as an abjection\nof grotesque acting \u2013 a form of acting whose political power to question the autonomous\nbourgeois subject was to be rediscovered by practitioners in the twentieth century.

In Austria this took the form\nof a \u2018Hanswurst Streit\u2019 (1747\u201369) and compre-\nhensive state censorship under the absolutist\nmonarchy of Maria Theresia and Joseph II.7\nHowever, even though the censorship of\nHanswurst performers often focused on their\ndangerous habit of \u2018extemporizing\u2019, there are\nindications that it marks an even more pro-\nfound epistemological break than the shift\nfrom improvised to text-based theatre, in-\nvolving changes in what and how theatre\nsignified. \nA Bourgeois Need for Self-Representation\nIn this article I propose to read the Hans-\nwurst banishment as part of the larger his-\ntorical relationship between discourses on\nacting and the emergence of a modern self in\nthe Enlightenment. My main thesis with res-\npect to this relationship is that the so-called\n\u2018natural\u2019 acting style developed by theatre\nreformers from around the middle of the eigh-\nteenth century is a response to an increasing\nneed for self-representation, which turns the stage\ninto an aesthetic mirror for the bourgeois\nindividual. \nThis can be approached with the help of\nLacanian and post-Lacanian psychoanalytical\ntheories of subject formation. Lacan\u2019s theory\nof the mirror phase is highly pertinent here,\nas it not only shows how the child at a certain\nage first constitutes itself as a subject through\nits (mis-)recognition in the mirror, but also\nargues that this first identification with an\nexternal image or \u2018imago\u2019 sets the self on a\ntrack for future secondary identifications in\nthe search of an Ideal-I, that it \u2018situates the\nego, before its social determination, in a fic-\ntional direction.\u20198 The subject\u2019s (fictional)\nsense of cohesion and autonomy is given to it\nby the fact that in the mirror image the body\nappears in a sculptural perfection, as a\n\u2018Gestalt\u2019 that contrasts with its own sense of\nfragmentation. \nJulia Kristeva\u2019s theoretical contribution is\nto have argued that the child\u2019s identification\nin the mirror goes hand in hand with \u2013 or is\nactually preceded by \u2013 a rejection and repres-\n125\nAnton Stranitzky as Hanswurst. Eighteenth-century\netching, Wiener Stadt- und Landesbibliothek\n(Sammlung Fritz Bruckner).\nsion of bodily matters and energies that\nthreaten the constitution of an Ideal-I and the\nsense of a closed-off, separate self: \u2018Even\nbefore being like, \u201cI\u201d am not but do separate,\nreject, ab-ject. Abjection with a meaning\nbroadened to take in a subjective diachrony,\nis a precondition of narcissism.\u20199\nAs I have already discussed elsewhere\nwith respect to Gotthold Ephraim Lessing\u2019s\nHamburg Dramaturgy, Jacques Lacan can help\nus theorize the bourgeois desire for self-\nrecognition in the visual Gestalt of the tamed\nand disciplined actor, while Julia Kristeva\u2019s\nconcept of abjection can help us explain the\ncensoring reactions to physically transgres-\nsive forms of performing and ultimately to\nthe very threat of performance as such.10\nArguably Lacan and Kristeva both assert that\npsychic processes of subject formation and\nabjection are universal individual phenomena,\nbut Kristeva does indicate that\nsocio-historical considerations can be brought in\nat a second stage. They will allow us to under-\nstand why that demarcating imperative, which is\nsubsequently experienced as abjection, varies\naccording to time and space, even though it is\nuniversal.11\nAnd elsewhere she acknowledges \u2013 as if\nhistorically qualifying this universalism \u2013 that\n\u2018the transition from the baroque man, who\nhad neither interior nor exterior, to the psy-\nchological man of the romantics . . . occurred\nduring the eighteenth century\u2019.12\nTaking this as an invitation to historicize\npsychological subject formation, the ques-\ntions I would, therefore, like to ask of the\nHanswurst-banishment are: what kind of\nfigure, what kind of acting and along with it\nwhat kind of body was symbolically expelled\nfrom the stage by expelling Hanswurst?\nWhat was at stake in this banishment psycho-\nsocially, politically, and aesthetically?\nHanswurst and the Civilizing Process\nFor good reasons, some commentators have\nread the banishment of Hanswurst in terms\nof Norbert Elias\u2019s \u2018civilizing process\u2019 and its\nproblem with the carnivalesque plebeian\nbody: for if we compare Hanswurst\u2019s main\ncharacteristics and typical actions on stage\nwith Gottsched\u2019s values and ideals of a vir-\ntuous and dutiful human being, the comic-\nally stark contrast is that between a vulgar,\nbase, and \u2018uncivilized\u2019 peasant, on the one\nhand, and a reasoned, restrained, and \u2018civil-\nized\u2019 bourgeois citizen, on the other. \nAccordingly, in another prologue play by\nKaroline Neuber, Der alte und der neue Ge-\nschmack (1738), the \u2018old taste\u2019 is personified\nby a peasant (Bauer) while the \u2018new taste\u2019 is\na \u2018junger wohlerzogener Mensch\u2019 (\u2018young, well-\nmannered man\u2019).13 Thus Hanswurst \u2013 in his\noriginal conception a \u2018Sauschneider\u2019 (pig but-\ncher) by profession but in later plays often a\npeasant-like servant figure \u2013 always has an\nenormous voracity for food and drink, which\nis already indicated by his name (\u2018Pickel-\nhering\u2019 and \u2018Jean Potage\u2019 suggest similar\ncharacteristics but are not as gluttonous as\nHanswurst). He eats and drinks himself\nthrough enormous portions and grotesquely\nlong lists of food and booze and generally\nhas nothing else on his mind. As M\u00fcller-\nKampel analyzes this \u2018Fre\u00dfsack and S\u00e4ufer\u2019\n(glutton and drunkard): \nWhether love intrigues are spun around him,\nwhether battles are being fought and corpses\nhaving to be collected, or whether he only has to\nstand guard or deliver a letter, like will-o\u2019-the\nwisps images of devouring or carousing are\nperpetually arising in him.14\nBy contrast, the readers of Gottsched\u2019s Welt-\nweisheit are admonished to exercise moder-\nation and self-restraint in their diet: \u2018one has\nto make oneself the master over one\u2019s senses\nand either break oneself of the habit of such\nunhealthy things altogether or stop with\nthe foods and beverages when they taste\nbest\u201915 \u2013 an idea that would never occur to\nHanswurst.\nSimilarly, while Gottsched in his Welt-\nweisheit preaches a Protestant work ethic of\ndiligence and moderation in expenditure,16\nHanswurst has a thoroughly materialistic\nWeltanschauung and is willing do anything\nfor money except work.17 He is happy to lie,\nthieve, act as a hired killer, or marry someone\nrich but old and ugly. Only being a fool is for\nfree, Hanswurst affirms in Stranitzky\u2019s Scipio,\n126\nfor everything else he requires money.18 This\nincludes even his own excrement: \u2018Money\nand faeces are the equivalents in which\nHanswurst deals,\u2019 as Gerhard Scheit notes.\n\u2018The jester wants money for everything and\nhe gives for everything his excrement. For\nborrowed money he offers the usurer \u201ctwo\npounds from my body . . . as soon as I\u2019ve had\na good meal\u201d.\u201919\nFinally, Hanswurst also exhibits a perma-\nnent lust for sexual adventures \u2013 his name\nand the essential prop of a wooden sword\nalso bearing obvious phallic connotations (as\nthe contemporary etching alongside demon-\nstrates in a scarcely veiled manner). \nMein Lust besteht in W\u00fcrst, die gro\u00df und v\u00f6llig\nseyn;\nWer mir sie nehmen will, der mu\u00df sich mit mir\nschmeissen:\nIch lie\u00df mir eh den Kopf, als meine W\u00fcrst\nwegreissen.\nEin jeder W\u00fcrst-Han\u00df stimt auch di\u00dffalls mit mir\nein.\n[My pleasure consists in sausages that are big\nand full; whoever wants to take them from me\nhas to fight with me. I\u2019d rather have my head\ntorn off than my sausage. Every Wurst-hans\nalso agrees with me in this.]\nBeing a notorious \u2018collector of women and\nsexual dreamer\u2019, Hanswurst\u2019s pet names for\nhis lovers (he calls them \u2018Menschern\u2019) reveal,\nas M\u00fcller-Kampel explains:\nhis view of sexuality as a mutual use of genitalia,\nwhich he in turn reifyingly conflates with the im-\nbibing of food and drink, the use of everyday\ntools, the operation of war weaponry, or the copu-\nlation of animals.\nFor example: \u2018my butterbarrel\u2019, \u2018you chosen\ninkwell of my quill\u2019, or \u2018yonder target at\nwhich I have already shot most of my\npowder\u2019.20 Many plots thus revolve around\nHanswurst chasing women or conversely\nfinding himself being chased by women.\nNeedless to say, such sexual appetite runs\ncounter to Gottsched\u2019s view that a virtuous\nperson should regard intercourse solely as a\nmeans for procreation and refrain from it\notherwise.21\nNot surprisingly Gottsched at the end of\nthis last section advises the person striving\nfor chastity that he avoid \u2018places where\nsensual pleasure is aroused, such as opera\ntheatres and dishonourable comedies, in\nwhich romantic escapades, dirty jokes, and\nfooleries are the best adornment\u2019 (\u2018Er\nvermeide ferner die Oerter, wo man zur Wollust\ngereizet wird, als Opernb\u00fchnen und unehrbare\nKom\u00f6dien, darinnen verliebte Romanstreiche,\nZoten, und Narretheidungen der beste Zierrath\nsind\u2019).22 Gottsched obviously saw the stage\nas providing direct models or sensual\nenticement for the spectator\u2019s behaviour \u2013\nthe dilemma being, as we have seen above,\nthat he wanted to use the theatre as a didactic\nvehicle precisely because it was a medium\nappealing to the senses. Consequently, cen-\nsoring and controlling the action or the\nfigures on stage for Gottsched was synony-\nmous with educating and restraining people\nin the audience.\nWhile Hanswurst apparently gives free\nreign to his drives, the tenor of Gottsched\u2019s\n127\nA priapic Wursthans. Seventeenth\/eighteenth-century\netching, Germanisches Nationalmuseum N\u00fcrnberg.\n\u2018practical\u2019 Weltweisheit and by extension of\nhis theatre reforms is the neccessary control\nof one\u2019s affects. As we \u2018cannot root out the\npassions altogether\u2019, Gottsched says, \u2018it is\ntherefore enough that we learn to bring them\nunder the obedience of reason\u2019 (\u2018Es ist also\ngenug, da\u00df wir [die Leidenschaften] unter den\nGehorsam der Vernunft bringen\u2019).23 \u2018Vernunft\u2019\nhere serves the function of the superego \u2013 be\nit as the moral agent for the individual or as\nthe three unities and various other rules for\nthe composition and performance of a play\n(these \u2018new\u2019 regular plays were often referred\nto by Gottsched and Neuber as \u2018vern\u00fcnftige\nSt\u00fccke\u2019, or \u2018reasonable plays\u2019). \nIn light of this it makes sense to read the\nHanswurst figure as a victim of the \u2018civiliz-\ning process\u2019, whose long-term influence in\nchanging social structures towards a higher\nlevel of differentiation and integration in\nmodernity, according to Elias, exact the price\nof people\u2019s increasing and differentiating\ncontrol of affects and the gradual formation\nof a strong superego.24 This also seems to be\nthe object of Gottsched\u2019s reform of comedy. \nIn his Critische Dichtkunst he constrasts the\n\u2018old comedy\u2019 of the ancient Greeks, which he\ndescribes as belonging to peasant culture \u2013\n\u2019comedy\u2019, as he points out, meaning \u2018village\nsong\u201925 \u2013 with the \u2018new comedy\u2019 of Terence,\nwhich was \u2018regular\u2019 and imitated nature with-\nout resorting to comic figures such as Hans-\nwurst or Harlekin who have \u2018no example in\nnature\u2019.26 Gottsched summarizes the ideal\ncomedy as follows: \nDie Com\u00f6die ist nichts anders, als eine Nachahmung\neiner lasterhaften Handlung, die durch ihr l\u00e4cherliches\nWesen den Zuschauer belustigen, aber auch zugleich\nerbauen kann. (p. 348)\n[Comedy is nothing but an imitation of a wicked\naction, which through its ridiculousness can amuse\nbut at the same time edify the spectator.]\nIn other words, the spectator should no\nlonger laugh with a comic figure but about the\nwicked action of a person, while at the same\ntime applying this laughter to himself. Sup-\nporting the formation of a strong superego,\nhis gaze should turn in on itself. This reform\ndemanded an identity of the subject and\nobject of comedy which Hanswurst or Harle-\nquin as generic comic figures could not pro-\nvide (as I will discuss below).\nUnlike Gottsched\u2019s reform of comedy,\nwhich ultimately left no place for the comic\nfigure, Neuber\u2019s reforming ideas at the time\nof the Deutsches Vorspiel still included the\nHarlekin figure, whom she wanted to con-\nvert for didactic purposes.27 This project,\nhowever, would amount to a taming and\ndisciplining of the comic figure, as was\nindeed witnessed in Neuber\u2019s later plays. As\nLessing later criticized, the reformers \nhatten nur das bunte J\u00e4ckchen und den Namen\nabgeschafft, aber den Narren behalten. Die Neuberin\nselbst spielte eine Menge St\u00fccke, in welchen Harlekin\ndie Hauptperson war. Aber Harlekin hie\u00df bei ihr H\u00e4ns-\nchen und war ganz wei\u00df anstatt scheckicht gekleidet. \n[The reformers had only got rid of the colourful jac-\nket and the name, but kept the fool. The Neuberin\nherself put on many plays in which Harlequin\nwas the main figure. But Harlequin with her was\ncalled Little Hans and was dressed all in white\ninstead of speckled colours.] \nEven though Lessing here as elsewhere mocks\nNeuber\u2019s and Gottsched\u2019s \u2018banishment\u2019 of\nthe comic figure, his own dramaturgy argu-\nably still profited from it. For not only was\nHanswurst turned into the harmless diminu-\ntive of H\u00e4nschen (after he had already been\nreplaced by the more \u2018civilized\u2019, i.e. \u2018frenchi-\nfied\u2019, Harlekin), but the comic figure itself\nwas also separated out from the main action\nin the form of Hanswurstiaden or Harlequin\npantomimes (i.e., plays in which Hanswursts\nor Harlequins were the main figures). These\ncomic mini-plays were then relegated to the\nposition of pre- or after-play entertainments\nand merely framed the main \u2018serious\u2019 drama\nof the evening. \nLessing\u2019s Hamburger Dramaturgie reflects\nthis new high\/low division only in as much\nas these Hanswurstiaden and Harlequin panto-\nmimes, like ballets and other \u2018side shows\u2019,\nare hardly ever mentioned in his comments\non an evening at the theatre.28 Lessing\u2019s and\nMylius\u2019s own early theatre journalism had\nactually programmatically brought about\nsuch a cultural marginalization of popular\ntheatre by excluding it from critical reflec-\ntion. Thus they state at the beginning of their\nBeytr\u00e4ge zur Historie und Aufnahme des Theaters\n128\n(Contributions to the History and Acceptance\nof the Theatre, 1750): \nAlle diejenigen Schaub\u00fchnen werden also au\u00dfer der\nSph\u00e4re unsrer Betrachtungen seyn, auf welchen sich\nnicht anders, als von ohngef\u00e4hr, ein gutes Schauspiel\nsehen l\u00e4\u00dft, auf welchen das Geschrey des Hanswursts\nund seiner Cameraden die Vernunft und den guten\nGeschmack \u00fcbert\u00e4ubet und die Dummheit entz\u00fccket;\nauf welchen die curieusen, extragalanten Haupt- und\nStaats- und Heldenactionen das B\u00fcrgerrecht noch\nhaben, und kurz, welche Verstand und Sitten\nverderben.29\n[All those stages will remain outside the sphere of\nour considerations on which one can see a good\nplay only by chance, on which the screaming of\nHanswurst and his mates drowns out reason and\ngood taste and delights stupidity; on which the\ncurious and extra-gallant chief- and state- and\nheroic actions still have civil rights, and in short\nwhich corrupt mind and morals.]\nHanswurst within a Baroque Episteme\nThe contrast in Lessing\u2019s description between\nthe screaming Hanswurst and the (extra)\ngallant heroic actions makes us realize that\nthe Hanswurst figure ultimately cannot be\nviewed in isolation if we want to understand\nits role in the civilizing process and its shift-\ning epistemes. Rather, we have to backtrack a\nlittle and look at the whole constellation of\nartistocratic hero, opponent, and comic\nfigure within the Haupt- und Staatsaktionen\n(chief and state actions) of seventeenth-\ncentury touring companies. As Erika Fischer-\nLichte has shown, this constellation and the\nsemiotics of German baroque acting practices,\ntoo, could be read within the context of the\ncivilizing process,30 since they embody new\nsocial requirements brought on by the trans-\nformation from a warrior class to a courtly\nnobility at the beginning of the seventeenth\ncentury, which Elias summarizes as follows:\nDeliberation, calculation over long periods, self-\ncontrol, precise regulation of one\u2019s own affects,\nand knowledge of people and the whole terrain\nbecome essential prerequisites for every social\nsuccess.31\nAccordingly, the heroic ego in these baroque\nplays of labyrinthine intrigue and changing\nfortune had to prove itself by resisting the\nonslaught of affects. \nThe disciplined art of acting which corres-\nponds to this aim is elaborated in instruc-\ntional texts as late as Franciscus Lang\u2019s\nDissertatio de Actione Scenica (1727). As here\nillustrated, the actor is taught to assume the\nbasic posture, the so-called \u2018crux scenica\u2019, in\nwhich the feet were placed at a ninety-degree\nangle, while performing strictly prescribed\nphysical representations of the emotions.32\nBy thus controlling his body according to the\nrules, the hero proves that he is also in\ncontrol of the affects that storm in on him.\nHis opponent, on the other hand, often a\ntyrant or a madman,\nis characterized by being unable to follow the rules:\nhe runs across the stage, hits his head against the\nwall so that blood is squirting out, rolls around on\n129\nIllustration of proper posture in Franciscus Lang\u2019s\nDissertatio de Actione Scenica, Francke Verlag, Bern\n1975, p. 29 (reprinted with permission from Narr\nFrancke Attempto Verlag).\nthe floor, and thus manifestly proves to the specta-\ntor that he is helplessly at the mercy of the affects.33\nThe comic figure \u2013 Pickelhering, Hanswurst,\nor Harlequin \u2013 similarly violates all the rules\nof this highly regimented acting: rather than\nkeeping his body taut and controlled, he\nbends his knees and upper body, shows his\nnaked behind, and gestures obscenely below\nthe waist. But instead of being determined\nby affects he is ruled by bodily materialism.\nInstead of proving himself through changing\nfortune like the heroic martyr, he adapts to\nevery change, thinking only of his stomach,\nnever about the salvation of his soul.34\nHis reversals and transgressions were not\nnecessarily a threat to aristocratic authority.\nWithin a baroque world view, he was funny\nnot because he \u2018subverted\u2019 the power of the\nheroes but because he revealed his own\npeasant ignorance of courtly ideals.35 Rather,\nas Fischer-Lichte has argued with reference\nto Mikhail Bakhtin\u2019s theory of carnival,\nwithin the episteme of baroque theatre the\nHanswurst figure had an important compen-\nsating function in the civilizing process:\nHe oppose[d] the controllable and controlled\nbody of the hero with the grotesque body of\ncarnival, [bringing] the excluded back into the\nframe of society. In doing so [the comic figure]\ntook on a relieving function for those spectators\nwho were not yet up to the pressures of the\ncivilizing process and the demands of the new\nbehavioural ideals.36\nWhat is not entirely convincing about this\nargument is that early eighteenth-century\nreformers simply \u2018thought the compensatory\nfunction of the fool to be outmoded and\nobsolete\u2019.37 This cannot account for all their\nmotivations, and even less for their fervour\nin banishing him, which I shall now address. \nI take my cue from a Hanswurst prologue\npublished in 1816, which is itself part of a\nnineteenth-century, counter-Enlightenment\nnostalgia for the fool and which bemoans the\ndemise of Hanswurst and the fact that he is\nnow mostly known as a puppet-play effigy\nfor children. Commenting on the audience\u2019s\npleasure which has since supplanted the\nenjoyment of watching a Hanswurst perfor-\nmance, the Hanswurst prologue says:\nDoch will ich bey Leib damit nicht meinen,\nDa\u00df au\u00dfer mir keine Lust kann erscheinen:\nSie seh\u2019n auf den Brettern immer nur sich\nUnd wer ist spa\u00dfiger als der Herr Ich?38\n[Yet by no means do I want to say here\nThat no pleasure but me can appear;\nIt is always themselves who on stage they see\nAnd who could be funnier than Mr Me?]\nWhat follows is a long list of scenes the\nspectators might see, a kind of parodic index\nto the now dominant repertoire of bourgeois\ncomedy and sentimental family melodrama.\nFrom Osmotic to Closed Body, Stage, Self\nEven though the representation of the bour-\ngeois world and bourgeois heroes in comedy\nand tragedy was still a far cry for Gottsched\nand Neuber, because tragedy was reserved\nfor aristocratic heroes, I would maintain that\nthey were already carving out a space for the\nbourgeois subject. Thus Gottsched not only\nwants tragedy to hold a critical mirror up to\naristocratic rulers \u2013 to \u2018teach you, the gods of\nthis earth, that you, too, are humans\u201939 \u2013 but\nconversely also paves the way for bourgeois\ntragedy by asking, \u2018Can\u2019t a noble man and\ncitizen practise on a small scale what princes\nand heroes have done on a large scale?\u201940\nGottsched signalled a move from the virtu-\nous nobleman to the \u2018noble citizen\u2019 by insinu-\nating that the ideals inscribed in baroque\ntragedy \u2013 virtue and gallant self-control \u2013 are\ntransferrable to the emerging bourgeoisie.\nHanswurst is an obstacle to this project of\n\u2018seeing Herr Ich\u2019 on stage not only because of\nwhat he represents but also because of what\nand how he communicates in the theatre.\nFirst of all, he is not a suitable object for\nidentification because he is essentially a\nmask. \u2018He behaves himself like no human\nbeing amongst ourselves behaves himself\u2019\nwas a contemporary objection Lessing cites,\nand \u2018it is nonsensical to see the same\nindividual appear in a different play every\nday\u2019. To which Lessing insightfully responds:\n\u2018So he doesn\u2019t have to announce who he is. . . .\nOne has to see him not as an individual but\nrather as a whole genre.\u201941\nLessing himself was quite prepared to\ntolerate this \u2018genre\u2019 at the fringes, but at the\n130\nsame time he began to demand of tragedy\nthat it should have heroes \u2018of the same\nsubstance\u2019 (\u2018vom selben Schrot und Korn\u2019) as\n\u2018us\u2019 \u2013 that is, the bourgeois spectators.42 How-\never, such an aesthetic identification with indi-\nvidual heroes on stage required an aesthetic\ndistance and a mirror \u2018plane\u2019, a \u2018fourth wall\u2019\nbetween stage and auditorium. In other\nwords, I argue that the emerging fourth wall\nserved the same function as the mirror\u2019s\nsurface in Lacan\u2019s model: without it, the illu-\nsion necessary for subject formation through\nthe aesthetics of sympathy (Mitleids\u00e4sthetik)\ndeveloped by Lessing could not have worked.\nSimilarly, the actor\u2019s corporeality would have\nto be moulded into an individual, closed-off\nGestalt the spectator could identify with. The\nfool, by contrast, represented an \u2018osmotic\u2019\nrelationship between stage and auditorium;\nhis was a dangerously \u2018osmotic\u2019 body which\nthreatened subject formation and therefore\nhad to be \u2018abjected\u2019. \nWhat causes abjection, according to\nKristeva, is \u2018what disturbs identity, system,\norder. What does not respect borders, posi-\ntions, rules\u2019.43 Stranitzky\u2019s Hanswurst and\nKurz\u2019s Bernardon, as M\u00fcller-Kampel has\nanalyzed, represent a\nbaroque body without a self \u2013 which is in a double\nsense a \u2018character-less\u2019 and \u2018unreasonable\u2019 body\nwhose parts and functions do not obey their\nbearer, lead their own lives, and often enough get\ninto conflict with one another.44\nIt is, moreover, associated with the kind of\nquintessentially \u2018open\u2019 body that Bakhtin has\nidentified as the grotesque body of carnival: \nThe distinctive character of this body is its open\nunfinished nature, its interaction with the world.\nThese traits are most fully and concretely revealed\nin the act of eating; the body transgresses here its\nown limits: it swallows, devours, rends the world\napart, is enriched and grows at the world\u2019s\nexpense.45\nIt is also easy to see that Hanswurst does not\nadhere to the division between stage and\nauditorium: dramaturgically he is often posi-\ntioned at the threshold between specators\nand performance space, continually destroy-\ning any illusion by extemporizing and\naddressing himself directly to to the audi-\nence. His asides frequently break through\nthe reality of the stage action and point to its\ntheatricality: everything to him is play. While\nthis did not constitute a problem within\nbaroque theatre, it did become a problem for\nan emerging bourgeois audience who wanted\nto see their world mirrored on stage. \nFurthermore, the fool is not only posi-\ntioned right at the threshold between stage\nand auditorium but, as a carnivalesque figure,\nalso \u2018belongs to the borderline between art\nand life\u2019, as Mikhail Bakhtin has stated.46 In a\nsituation where the theatre is not yet firmly\ninstitutionalized but still part of the\nmarketplace, the comic performer is not\nlimited to the one theatrical site and is\ntherefore capable of forming strong associa-\ntive links with other popular forms of enter-\ntainment and popular (pre-modern) beliefs\nand practices. Without making a distinction\nbetween actor and character, Gottsched\u2019s\nmoral weekly Der Biedermann thus talks of\na lewd Hans Wurst who travels around from vil-\nlage to village with quacks, jugglers, marionettes,\nand cheapjacks. Everybody knows that these kind\nof people seek their sagacity in obscenities and\ntheir wit in a more than peasanty lewdness. These\npeople I do not like to defend: rather I detest\neverything dishonourable and disgraceful they\ntend to produce.47\nRelated to this is my point about Hanswurst\nas \u2018osmotic body\u2019 \u2013 someone who embodied\nand was associated with a pre-modern con-\nception of the body. \nThe Pre-Modern Perception of the Body\nMy reading here was originally inspired by\nBarbara Duden\u2019s work on body perceptions\nin the seventeenth and early eighteenth\ncentury. She states that: \u2018The society of the\nseventeenth century did not yet have room\nfor a corporeality that was isolated, \u201cdisem-\nbedded\u201d from the total network of social\nrelations.\u201948 With reference to contemporary\ndescriptions of the plague, Duden notes that\na \u2018constant exchange took place between the\ninside and the outside, a relation of osmotic\nexchanges with the elements\u2019.49 Looking at\nthe narratives of medical patients in the early\n131\neighteenth century, she observes that the body\nwas perceived to be vulnerable to vapours,\n\u2018impressions, delusions, and imagined things\n[as] the prime causes of illness\u2019.50\nIn this cosmos the skin does not close off the body,\nthe inside, against the outside world. In like man-\nner the body itself is also never closed off.51\nThe bodies of actors and spectators in the\ntheatre were no exception to such perme-\nability. On the contrary, as Joseph Roach\nexplains in a study that links theories of\nacting to the history of science, seventeenth-\ncentury actors and acting have to be under-\nstood in terms of the rhetoric of passions\nderived from Quintilian. Drawing on ancient\nphysiological doctrines such as pneumatism,\nthis rhetoric defined the actor\u2019s \u2018imperson-\nations as a mode of inspiration\u2019, whereby\n\u2018inspiration\u2019 was understood literally as a\nkind of breathing-into-the-body: \nThe inspiring forces came literally out of thin air.\nA vital pneuma, imbibed from a universal aether,\nsupposedly permeated the blood as spirits, and,\nradiating outward from the heart and lungs, dis-\nplayed inward feelings as outward motions. This\nmagical aether was neither fire nor water, air nor\nearth, but a fifth essence more subtle than any\nsubstance. The word emotion itself derives from\nthe Latin emovere (to move out, to stir up), which\nassumed the existence of a vital spirit, constantly\nactive and motive, suffused throughout the human\nframe.52\nThe actor who could call upon such \u2018inspir-\nation\u2019 with his imagination was in a position\nthat was especially privileged and at the same\ntime dangerous : \nThe rhetoric of the passions that derived from pneu-\nmatism endowed the actor\u2019s art with three poten-\ncies of an enchanted kind. First, the actor possessed\nthe power to act on his own body. Second, he\npossessed the power to act on the physical space\naround him. Finally, he was able to act on the\nbodies of the spectators who shared that space with\nhim. In short he possessed the power to act.53\nAs Roach points out, this power also made\nthe actor physically dangerous to the audi-\nence as well as to himself:\nA seventeenth-century physician, steeped in\nageless anxieties of bodily penetration by vapours\nfrom below, could not but notice the unsettling\nresemblance between inspiration and disease.54\nAs a most flexible and trained but at the\nsame time dangerously uncontrollable actor,\nHanswurst was bound to abuse this power.\nHis humour, as we have seen, revolved\naround gluttony and defecation, sexual acti-\nvity, birth and death, emphasized all orifices,\nbodily functions and emanations. In this way\nhis imagination might literally have been\nseen as \u2018infectious\u2019 and dangerous. \nSuch power of the imagination (the Ger-\nman word Einbildungskraft literally means\nthe \u2018power to imprint\u2019) can also be seen in\nanother example from Gottsched\u2019s Bieder-\nmann, this time involving Harlekin. Warning\nof the dangers of dissimulation at the carni-\nval, a correspondent writes:\nPeople go to great effort to disfigure themselves\nthrough ugly masks and are not satisfied with the\nface and appearance given to them by nature. . . .\nNobody considers that had he been born this way\nhe would live as an unhappy monster to the\nabhorrence of others. Just recently we had a\nmemorable example, as a mother who frequented\nthe carnival every day gave birth to a child in\nwhose face a mask of flesh had grown and whose\nbody showed red, yellow, and green patches all\nover: for the mother had mostly attended the\ncarnival in the costume of a Harlequin.55\nThis example effectively condenses several\ncontemporary cultural fears into one phobic\nimage: 1) the fear of maternal imagination,\nwhich was believed to have a direct material\nimpact on the appearance of the unborn\nchild;56 2) the fear of uncontrolled artistic\nimagination in the shape of the \u2018unnatural\u2019\nfantasy figure Harlequin; and 3) the fear of\nacting as dissimulation, as embodied in the\nmask.57 The fear of maternal imagination\nespecially relates this example to Kristeva\u2019s\ntheory of abjection, which she links to the\nattempt to separate from the maternal body:\nThe abject confronts us, . . . within our personal\narcheology, with our earliest attempts to release the\nhold of maternal entity even before ex-isting out-\nside of her, thanks to the autonomy of language.58\nYet in the eighteenth century, this rejection of\nan osmotic\/merging relation with other\n132\nbodies takes the form not so much of a\npersonal as a cultural form of abjection,\nwhich took place in several different spheres\nof society. As Duden has noted with respect\nto the medicalization of society in the\neighteenth century, for example, peasants,\nthe poor and women, who generally held to\nthe traditional (pre-modern) conceptions of\nthe body much longer, came to be considered\nas having \u2018offensive bodies\u2019 by Enlighten-\nment reformers of medicine:\nIn the final analysis, the Enlightenment reformer\nwas not concerned with changing behaviour but\nwith creating a new body. As one country doctor\nwrote from the provinces, \u2018It would be necessary,\nso to speak, to change the nature of the peasant . . .\nto make him into an absolutely different kind of\nperson.\nThe creation of a new, \u2018sealed-off\u2019 body was,\nhowever, not restricted to only one field,\npractice, or discipline but has to be viewed in\nan interdisciplinary manner. Hanswurst and\nHarlequin play pivotal roles in this respect\nbecause they are positioned \u2018at the border\nbetween art and life\u2019 and thus cross different\nspheres.\nIn conclusion, we can say that Hans-\nwurst\u2019s banishment is clearly multiply over-\ndetermined by several, often seemingly\ndisparate discourses: Not only is he, as we\nhave seen, opposed to the \u2018civilized\u2019 bour-\ngeois values Gottsched and the Neubers\nwant to propagate through model behaviour;\nnot only does he not adhere to the rules of\nreason; and not only is he not a \u2018natural\u2019\nindividual; but he is also representative of an\nosmotic body and an osmotic stage. As such\nhe threatens the spectator with dangerous\nphysical energies that do not allow for an\naesthetic distance and therefore for the\nconstitution of the subject in the mirror of the\nstage.\nConclusion: Subjection and Abjection\nIf the new aesthetic relationship of sympa-\nthetic identification between spectator and\nprotagonist in bourgeois tragedy can be\ntheorized in terms of Lacan\u2019s psychoanalytic\ntheory of subject formation, as I have argued,\nthen the early banishment of Hanswurst, as I\nhope to have shown, could be theorized in\nterms of Kristeva\u2019s theory of abjection.The\nabject for Kristeva is defined as whatever is\nrejected from the subject\u2019s (or the culture\u2019s)\nself-definition with a feeling of disgust. It is\nthat which does not allow for a recuperation\nof the other as an (aesthetic) object: \u2018The\nabject has only one quality of the object \u2013 that\nof being opposed to I.\u201959 Abjection is thus\nalways a function of the superego: \u2018To each\nego its object, to each superego its abject.\u201960\nIn the case of Hanswurst, as we have seen, it\nwas the superego of \u2018reason\u2019 that drove him\noff the stage. \u2018Ich\u2019 could come about in bour-\ngeois theatre because the censoring \u2018Herr Ich\u2019\nabjected Hanswurst.\nThe actual historical form which censor-\nship of the comic figure took in the Enlighten-\nment varied historically and geographically\nfrom institutional marginalization, critical\nintervention (Gottsched), or critical silencing\n(Lessing), to the (attempted) state censorship\nof plays and even gestures. Thus Joseph von\nSonnenfels, the most powerful censor in the\nAustrian Enlightenment (which was an\nEnlightenment \u2018decreed\u2019 by the monarchy\nrather than genuinely motivated by a bour-\ngeois emancipation) demanded in 1770 that\nthe \u2018concept of extemporizing be given its\nbroadest meaning\u2019, including expecially \u2018ges-\ntures through which often an itself innocent\nspeech can become the smuttiest joke\u2019.61\nIn Catholic southern Germany and Austria,\nas I mentioned earlier, the comic figure with\nits \u2018baroque body\u2019 is much more resilient\nthan in northern, Protestant areas. This is\nprobably due to a Catholic sensualism that\nwas opposed to a Lutheran and Calvinist\nrationalism, and favoured the perpetuation\nof baroque traditions.62 But here, too, as the\nrecent work of Beatrix M\u00fcller-Kampel has\nsystematically analyzed, the comic figure\nundergoes a gradual taming and civilizing\nprocess which amounts to a kind of self-\ncensorship of theatre practitioners. \nStranitzky\u2019s Hanswurst thus eventually\ntransforms into Johann La Roche\u2019s harmless\nKasperl, who represents a \u2018mere diminutive\nof the previous Hanswurstian corporeality\n[Leiblichkeit]\u2019 and is gradually relegated to\n133\nincreasingly minor parts.63 Often the later\nforms of Hanswurst or Kasperl themselves\nbecome civilized into figures of identifica-\ntion, if not for grown-up audiences then at\nleast for children. In order to achieve this,\nhowever, anything grotesque, disgusting,\nhorrible, revolting, loud, and transgressive\nabout these figures had to be \u2018abjected\u2019 in the\nprocess:\nIf the Hanswurst of the eighteenth century had\nscreamed, roared, howled, and bawled, Kasperl\nnow squeaks childishly through the world. The\nmountains of sausages and meat that he devoured\nhave shrunken to a Gugelhupf, and instead of the\nbarrels of beer, wine, and schnapps he prefers a\nglass of milk or lemonade. The streams of sperm,\nblood, urine, spit, and vomit have long ceased to\nflow, and anything faecal or sexual he does not\neven linguistically take in his mouth any more. He\ndoes not fight, clobber, betray, insult, curse, and\nmock any more, but, on the contrary shows\nchildren that all this can lead to no good.64\n\u2018And yet,\u2019 as Kristeva says, \u2018from its place of\nbanishment, the abject does not cease chal-\nlenging its master.\u201965 Analogously, as would\nhave to be shown in detail since it is beyond\nthe scope of this essay, the grotesque body\nand grotesque acting would be rediscovered\nin twentieth-century German and Austrian\ntheatre as a politically powerful tool to dis-\nlodge the notion of the autonomous bourgeois\nsubject \u2013 Herr Ich \u2013 by theatre practitioners\nranging from Bertolt Brecht and Heiner\nM\u00fcller to Peter Handke and Elfriede Jelinek. \nNotes and References\n1.

While this repertoire was extremely varied and\ncould be said to have consisted of the dramatic works of\nthe world literature of its time, the plays were mostly\nreduced to the main plot and often changed to the point\nof unrecognizability.\n3. Helmut Asper has convincingly shown that the\ndifferent names for the comic figure do not indicate\nentirely distinct types but rather appear as different\ngeneric names \u2013 some more prevalent at one time than\nothers \u2013 for one and the same type of figure. Thus,\nroughly, the name Pickelhering is more prevalent in the\nlate-sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, when\nEnglish acting troupes introduced professional theatre\ninto the German-speaking landscape, Hanswurst is the\ngeneric term used more often by the end of the seven-\nteenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries,\nand the name Harlekin is used increasingly from the\nbeginning of the eighteenth century onwards, with the\nrising popularity of commedia dell\u2019arte plays. See Helmut\nAsper, Hanswurst (Emsdetten: Verlag Lechte, 1980), esp.\nChapters I and II.\nEven though Gottsched, Neuber, and Lessing often\nuse the names interchangeably, contemporary sources\ndo also make distinctions, especially between Hanswurst\nand Harlekin, based on their different connotations and\npresumed \u2018origins\u2019. Thus, Harlekin is considered more\nsophisticated than Hanswurst, but at the same time is\noften associated with \u2018foreignness\u2019 and with the \u2018artifi-\nciality\u2019 of opera and courtly culture, since the figure\narrived in Germany from Italy via France.\n4.
