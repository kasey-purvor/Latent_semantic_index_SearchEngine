This paper attempts to redress this\nbalance by comparing 1,117 participants\u2019 attitudes toward online and offline acts of infidelity.\nA factor analysis was carried out that yielded three components of infidelity: sexual infi-\ndelity, emotional infidelity, and pornography. More importantly, this study revealed that on-\nline acts of betrayal do not fall into a discrete category of their own. A MANOVA was\nperformed and revealed a statistically significant difference on the combined dependent vari-\nables for the interaction of gender by age, age by relationship status, and Internet sexual ex-\nperience. The hypotheses were, in part, supported. However, counter to what was predicted,\nin the main younger people were more likely to rate sexual acts as acts of betrayal than older\nindividuals. It is concluded here that individuals do perceive some online interactions to be\nacts of betrayal. In contrast to some researchers\u2019 claims, it is suggested here that we do need to\nconsider how bodies are reconstructed online. Moreover, these results have important impli-\ncations for any treatment rationale for infidelity (both online and offline).\n569\nCYBERPSYCHOLOGY & BEHAVIOR\nVolume 6, Number 6, 2003\n\u00a9 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.\nINTRODUCTION\nTHE LITERATURE IS REPLETE with studies on atti-tudes towards offline infidelity. However, there\nis a paucity of research available on what online\nacts men and women consider to be unfaithful. Re-\nsearch that has investigated online infidelity has\nmostly focused on addiction to cybersex and the\navailable treatment for these cybersex addicts and\ntheir partners.1\u20136 This paper, in contrast, focuses on\nhow potential acts of offline infidelity compare with\npotential acts of online infidelity. In addition, gen-\nder, age, relationship status, and sexually experi-\nenced Internet user differences are examined. In a\nworld where online interactions continue to become\nmore frequent, it has become imperative for psy-\nchologists to understand the nature of these inter-\nactions and the repercussions of these interactions.\nIt is maintained here that it is critical to investigate\nwhether interactions online are perceived to be un-\nfaithful and by whom as such data will inform\nways forward within clinical practice and therapy.\nFor example, while some therapists might be dis-\nmissive of online sexual acts or communication,\nperceiving these as no \u201creal threat\u201d to an offline re-\nlationship, research into attitudes on online infidelity\nmight reveal a different perspective. Rather than iso-\nlating potential acts of online infidelity, this study\nconsiders both online and offline acts of betrayal\nand whether, when taken as a whole, there are dif-\nferent types of infidelity.\nBefore deliberating on potential online acts of be-\ntrayal, this paper considers what might constitute\nan act of offline infidelity. Most researchers would\nagree that we need to consider other acts of infidelity\nin addition to sexual intercourse. For example, Roscoe\nSchool of Applied Social and Human Sciences, University of Western Sydney, Penrith South, NSW, Australia.\net al.7 focused on undergraduates\u2019 views on acts of\ninfidelity and found that participants indicated three\nprinciple behaviors: dating or spending time with a\ndifferent partner; having sexual intercourse with\nsomeone else; and engaging in other sexual interac-\ntions with someone else such as kissing, flirting, and\npetting. To supplement work such as Roscoe et al.\u2019s7\nstudy, Yarab et al.8 investigated what extradyadic\nbehaviors individuals identify as unfaithful acts in\nthe context of committed romantic relationships.\nYarab et al.\u2019s8 study yielded an array of unfaithful\nbehaviors in addition to sexual intercourse, includ-\ning passionately kissing, sexual fantasies, non-sexual\nfantasies about falling in love, sexual attraction, ro-\nmantic attraction, flirting, and behavior in dyads\nsuch as studying, having lunch with, and going to a\nmovie with someone other than one\u2019s partner. These\nresearchers claim that \u201cmental exclusivity\u201d might be\nconsidered as important as \u201csexual exclusivity.\u201d In-\nterestingly, Yarab and Rice Allgeier9 found that,\nwhen considering sexual fantasies, the greater the\nthreat of the sexual fantasy to the current relation-\nship, the higher the fantasy was rated as unfaithful.\nFor instance, fantasizing about a partner\u2019s best friend\n(a great potential to disrupting the current relation-\nship) was considered by most to be more of a threat,\nand therefore more unfaithful, than fantasizing about\na movie star. In addition, these researchers found\nthat participants were more jealous about the idea\nof their partner fantasizing about their best friend\nthan fantasizing about a movie star.\nThe general consensus has been that men and\nwomen hold different viewpoints on offline mono-\ngamous relationships. For instance, Sheppard et al.10\nhave argued that men tend to view commitment and\nmonogamy as less attractive options than women\ndo. It also seems that men and women enter into\nextramarital relationships for different reasons\u2014\nwomen more because they are seeking a friendship\nor emotional relationship, while men tend to be\nmore interested in sexual relationships.11 Satisfac-\ntion within a marriage is also often marked by these\ngender differences, with men more likely to report\nsexual problems and women more likely to indi-\ncate problems with affection as the cause of discord\nwithin the marriage.12\nNoticeably, men are more likely to at least own\nup to having some type of extradyadic sexual expe-\nrience compared to women.13,14 Yarab et al.8 found\nthat men admitted more than women did to fanta-\nsizing about having sexual intercourse and giving\nand receiving oral sex with someone other than\ntheir partner. Moreover, men in their study were\nmore likely to state that they had \u201chit on\u201d someone\nelse.\nResearch has also considered gender differences\nin attitudes toward infidelity. For instance, Taylor15\nfound that men tend to judge a husband\u2019s affair as\nmore justifiable than a wife\u2019s affair. Furthermore,\nSheppard et al.10 found that male college students\nwere more likely to rate infidelity as more acceptable\nthan women rated infidelity. Paul and Galloway16\nfound, in their sample of undergraduate students,\nthat women (52%) were much more likely than men\n(30%) to say they would end the relationship if their\npartner was unfaithful to them. However, such gen-\nder differences are not always supported. For in-\nstance, it has been established that men and women\ntend to assess their own extradyadic behavior as\nmore acceptable than that of their partner.8 Further-\nmore, researchers have revealed that individuals\nare more forgiving of extradyadic behaviors com-\nmitted by members of their own gender compared\nto individuals of the opposite gender.17 One of the\nreasons for these discrepancies could possibly be the\nvariations in samples being used, including people\nwho are experienced in relationships who are asked\nto reflect on their current relationship, compared to\nnon-experienced participants who are asked to imag-\nine a hypothetical cheating partner.\nIn respect to which extradyadic behaviors cause\nmore upset for each gender, women more than men\nrate extradyadic emotional behavior as more upset-\nting than extradyadic sexual behavior.18 However,\nit is also noteworthy that both men and women re-\nport extradyadic sexual behavior to be more unac-\nceptable and a greater betrayal than extradyadic\nemotional behavior.18 Roscoe et al.7 also identified\ngender differences in what participants considered\nto be violations of fidelity. In their study, they asked\nparticipants to list what behaviors they believed con-\nstituted being unfaithful to a dating partner while\nin a serious dating relationship. They found that men\nwere more likely to state that a sexual encounter\nwith a different partner was an exemplar of infi-\ndelity. In contrast, women were more likely to state\nthat spending time with another and keeping se-\ncrets from a partner were acts of infidelity.\nOne shortcoming of most of the research in this\narea is the heavy reliance on college students as\nparticipants. This is clearly problematic given that\nthese are younger people who are often not mar-\nried or in cohabiting relationships. Hence, their lack\nof experience in long-term relationships could dra-\nmatically influence how these individuals perceive\nacts of infidelity.\nAdmittedly, a few researchers have explored how\nage, cohort, and period effects have shaped attitudes\ntowards sexual activity.19,20 These researchers\nmostly contend that attitudes towards extramarital\n570 WHITTY\nsex have changed little since the 1960s. Smith20 ar-\ngues that, while there is some truth to the sexual\nrevolution\/counterrevolution metaphor (where ap-\nproval in premarital sex increased in the 1960s to\nthe early 1980s and then leveled off after this time),\n\u201cthe revolutionary imagery is misleading because\nit does not clearly apply to sexual attitudes in gen-\neral.\u201d Rather, he argues, there is much less evidence\nof a sexual revolution in regard to extradyadic rela-\ntions. Moreover, in respect to age differences, Smith20\nprovides data that suggests (although no statistical\nanalysis is presented) that older individuals are more\ndisapproving of extramarital sexual relations com-\npared to younger people. He also presents some in-\nteresting differences in respect to relationship status.\nHe found that those who had never been married\nwere more approving of extramarital relations.\nWhile it can be strongly argued that social re-\nsearchers have still not unearthed the whole story\nabout attitudes towards offline acts of infidelity, the\nempirical research available on attitudes towards\nInternet infidelity is even scarcer. It has been con-\ntended that \u201cInternet infidelity is, of course, behav-\niorally different from other kinds of infidelity;\nhowever, the contributing factors and results are\nsimilar when we consider how it affects the way\npartners relate.\u201d3 Shaw,3 however, did not qualify\nhow online and offline infidelity are behaviorally\ndifferent. Indeed, while Shaw has made the assump-\ntion that infidelity, in essence, is a \u201crefusal to relate\npersonally to one\u2019s partner,\u201d3 researchers have ren-\ndered little work on specifying what online behav-\nior people consider as unfaithful.\nOther researchers have also made an attempt to\ndefine sexual acts unique to the Internet. For exam-\nple, cybersex has been defined as involving \u201ctwo\nonline users engaging in private discourse about\nsexual fantasies. The dialogue is typically accompa-\nnied by sexual self-stimulation.\u201d6 Moreover, Young\net al.6 have defined a cyberaffair as \u201ca romantic and\/\nor sexual relationship that is initiated via online con-\ntact and maintained predominantly through elec-\ntronic conversations that occur through e-mail and\nin virtual communities.\u201d Young and her colleagues,\nhowever, have mostly focused on cybersex addi-\ntion.4\u20136\nSex addicts are not the only individuals who pe-\nruse the web for erotic material. Cooper et al.21 iden-\ntified three categories of individuals who access\nInternet erotic material, including recreational users,\nsexual compulsive users (these individuals are ad-\ndicted to sex per se, and the Internet is but one\nmode where they can access sexual material), and\nat-risk users (these individuals would never have\ndeveloped a sexual addiction if it were not for the\nInternet). In addition, Cooper et al.\u2019s22 research ex-\ntended upon past anecdotal data of clinical cases,\nto focus on individuals who access the Internet for\nsexual purposes. These researchers found that most\nof their participants who surfed the web for erotic\nmaterial did not experience significant problems in\ntheir lives.\nIn addition to findings on who are cybersex con-\nsumers, other researchers have outlined the poten-\ntial erotic communication available online.23,24 Mehta\nand Plaza25 examined images from newgroups in\n1994, and found differences in the type of material\nposted by commercial and non-commercial users.\nCommercial users posted explicit pornographic ma-\nterial, and illegal sexual acts such as bestiality, more\nthan non-commercial users. Kim and Bailey23 pro-\nposed that the Internet is a haven for individuals\nwith a paraphilia. Although the sexual preferences\nfor paraphiles have changed little in recent times,\nthe Internet does provide another mode for such in-\ndividuals to live out their sexual fantasies. Durkin\nand Bryant24 have listed a number ways the Inter-\nnet can be used for erotic entertainment, including\nsome bulletin boards and chat rooms, where con-\nsenting individuals can exchange x-rated messages\nand pictures. In 1995, Levy estimated that, on a\nmonthly basis, up to 500,000 users visit sex news-\ngroups.26 Durkin and Bryant24 also proposed that\nthe Internet offers a certain kind of erotic talk, which\nthey named \u201chot chatting.\u201d \u201cHot chatting,\u201d they\nstate, is moving beyond light-hearted flirting and\ncan galvanize one\u2019s offline sex life. In the literature,\ntheorists have also made a distinction between \u201chot\nchatting\u201d and \u201ccybersex,\u201d purporting that cybersex\nalso involves obtaining sexual gratification.\nThe research on online lascivious material demon-\nstrates a need to consider other types of activity,\nbesides cybersex, as potential acts of infidelity.\nMoreover, given that accessing erotic material is not\nrestricted to addicts, distinguishing potential acts of\nonline infidelity is important to consider for the\nmaintaining of committed romantic relationships.\nThis current study explores individuals\u2019 views\non what constitutes an act of infidelity online and\ncompares this with perceptions of offline acts of in-\nfidelity. In addition, gender, age, relationship status,\nand sexually experienced online users differences\nare explored in respect to both online and offline in-\nfidelity. Given the importance placed on gender\ndifferences in previous studies on offline infidelity,\nthis study, in turn, took into account gender differ-\nences. To address the limitation of the focus on col-\nlege students in previous research on infidelity, the\nsample in the present study included individuals\nranging from 17 to 70 years old. Relationship status\nPUSHING THE WRONG BUTTONS 571\nwas considered, since it is possible that being in-\nvolved or uninvolved with another might shape\none\u2019s perception of what constitutes an act of infi-\ndelity. Finally, Internet sexual experience was taken\ninto account, as this factor, may also shape one\u2019s\nperception of Internet infidelity. Four hypotheses\nwere formed for this study:\nH1: Women will be more likely to consider all of the\nacts as violations of fidelity compared to men. This\nhypothesis is based on the literature outlined\nabove.\nH2: Older people will be more likely to consider all of\nthe acts as violations of fidelity compared to younger\npeople. Whilst most research has focused on col-\nlege students\u2019 attitudes towards infidelity, this\nhypothesis was constructed around the premise\nthat younger people have more liberal attitudes\ntowards sex compared to older individuals.\nH3: Those who are currently in a relationship will be\nmore likely to rate acts as violations of fidelity than\nthose not in a relationship. This is based on the as-\nsumption that those in a relationship are more\nlikely to imagine the \u201creal\u201d impact of an act of be-\ntrayal than individuals not in a relationship.\nH4: Those who have had online sexual experience will\nbe less likely to rate acts as violations of fidelity com-\npared to people with no online sexual experience. This\nhypothesis was devised based on the assumption\nthat these individuals will have more liberal sex-\nual attitudes compared to those who have not\nhad online sexual experiences.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nParticipants\nParticipants were recruited both online and of-\nfline. Although it may appear sufficient to recruit\nparticipants for a study of this kind by placing a\nsurvey on the Internet, this was deemed inappro-\npriate for this current study. Rather, it was consid-\nered imperative that, in addition, participants be\nrecruited offline, since participants who have had\nlittle or no Internet experience might nonetheless\nhave a view about what constitutes an act of be-\ntrayal online (e.g., their partner might be engaging\nin these activities).\nOne thousand, one hundred and seventeen indi-\nviduals were included in the final sample, of which\n468 were men (42%) and 649 (58%) were women.\n(Note that, although individuals of any sexual ori-\nentation were encouraged to participate in the study,\nonly six homosexuals and two bisexuals partici-\npated. As a consequence, they were omitted from\nthe final sample.) Ages ranged from 17 to 70 years\nold, with a mean of 30 (SD = 10.53) years old. A de-\ntailed account of the Internet and offline demo-\ngraphic characteristics of the sample are given in\nTable 1. In the MANOVA, age was broken into four\ncategories, according to Levinson\u2019s27 theory of life\nstages. These age categories included: the transition\nfrom adolescence to adulthood 17\u201322 years (31%),\nearly adulthood 23\u201344 (57%), and middle adult-\nhood to later adulthood were combined as there\nwere too few in the late adulthood category to war-\nrant a separate grouping 45\u201370 years (12%). In-\nternet sexual experience was defined based on\ndefinitions offered by Cooper et al.,22 who have de-\nfined \u201chot chatting\u201d as socializing with a member\n572 WHITTY\nTABLE 1.

Participants\nhad to provide a \u201cyes\u201d\/\u201dno\u201d response to this ques-\ntion. Thirty-sex percent of the sample admitted to\nhaving had some experience of hot chatting.\nAlthough it was not a condition to have used the\nInternet in order to participate in the study, all of\nthe participants used the Internet for at least 1 h on\naverage each week (for breakdown of hours spent\nonline each week, see Table 1). Ninety-six percent\nof the participants used email, 36% chat rooms, 31%\nnewsgroups, and 94% web-sites. Three hundred and\nfifty-three Australians filled out the survey offline,\nwhile the remainder of the sample filled out the\nsurvey online. Of the entire sample, 39% resided in\nAustralia or New Zealand, 52% in the Americas,\n3% in Europe, 1% in Asia, and 1% in the Middle East.\nMaterials\nFor this study, a survey was constructed that fo-\ncused on potential acts of infidelity both online and\noffline. Past research on offline infidelity was con-\nsidered in the construction of this survey. In addi-\ntion, seemingly equivalent online acts of infidelity\nwere included in the study. These items, were in part,\ndrawn from the literature on Internet sexual acts\ndiscussed in the literature to date. Because it was\ndifficult to ascertain which acts might be online\nequivalents, an exploratory factor analysis was per-\nformed to determine how items might be grouped\ntogether, if at all.\nSince it was deemed important to avoid construct-\ning a lengthy survey, it was decided to limit how\nmany items were investigated. Lengthy surveys on\nthe web can be problematic for two main reasons.\nFirstly, poor connection can lead to a survey crash-\ning prior to completion, and secondly, an extensive\nsurvey on the web might be a deterrent for many,\nthus leading to a poor response rate (although re-\nsponse rate is difficult to determine when placing\nsurveys on the web).\nParticipants were asked to rate on a 5-point Lik-\nert scale (from not considered as infidelity to ex-\ntreme infidelity) whether they thought the activity\nwas unfaithful to their partner. In each instance, it\nwas specified that the act was carried out without\none\u2019s partner. The potential acts of infidelity in-\ncluded going to strip clubs, viewing pornographic\nvideos or magazines, viewing pornographic pictures\non web sites, viewing porn sent via an email, en-\ngaging in hot chat with strangers online, engaging\nin hot chat regularly with the same person online,\nengaging in hot chat with with a stranger, just the\nonce, engaging in cybersex with strangers online,\nengaging in cybersex with a stranger, just the once,\nengaging in cybersex regularly with the same person\nonline, engaging in intercourse\/sexual acts offline,\nsharing deep emotional and or intimate information\nwith a person of the opposite sex (same sex if ho-\nmosexual) offline, sharing deep emotional and or\nintimate information with a person of the opposite\nsex (same sex if homosexual) online, maintaining a\nnon-sexual relationship with someone of the oppo-\nsite sex offline (same sex if homosexual), and main-\ntaining a non-sexual relationship with someone of\nthe opposite sex online (same sex if homosexual).\nBecause the terms cybersex and hot chatting might\nhave been unfamiliar to many a definition was pro-\nvided for each of these items. Cybersex was defined\nas obtaining sexual gratification whilst interacting\nwith another person online. Hot chat was defined\nas online socializing that has moved beyond light-\nhearted flirting.\nProcedure\nParticipants were recruited offline by placing no-\ntices in libraries, cafes, and community centers\nthroughout Sydney, Australia, inviting people to\nfill out a hardcopy of the survey which was to be\nplaced in a locked box on completion. Participants\nwere recruited online by placing notices in news-\ngroups and by placing links on webpages inviting\npeople to fill out the survey online (which was\nplaced on the web for approximately 6 months). In\nboth conditions participants were ensured anony-\nmity and were able to withdraw consent up until the\ntime of submitting the survey.\nRESULTS\nThe means and standard deviations for each of\nthe items are displayed in Table 2. As demonstrated\nin Table 2, the means for sexual intercourse, hot\nchatting, and cybersex are reasonably high, whereas\nthe means for pornographic items and non-sexual\nrelationships are fairly low.\nThe Infidelity Scale formed an internally consis-\ntent scale, with Cronbach a(1101) = 0.93. Ratings on\nthe Infidelity scale were subjected to an exploratory\nfactor analysis. The Principle Axis Factoring revealed\nthree factors with Eigen values of >1.0, which ac-\ncounted for 80% of the total variance. The Kaiser-\nMeyer-Olken measure of sampling adequacy was\n0.88, well above the value of 0.6 usually considered\nto be necessary for a good factor solution.28 These\nfactors were separately rotated orthogonally (Vari-\nmax) and obliquely (Direct Oblimin, delta = 0). In\nPUSHING THE WRONG BUTTONS 573\neach case, the same items loaded on the same three\nfactors. However, to allow for the possibility of inter-\ncorrelation among factors, the solution provided by\nthe oblique solution was chosen. The oblique rota-\ntion is reported in Table 3 (the higher factor loading\nfor each item appears in boldface type to aid inter-\npretation of the factor structure). It took six itera-\ntions to produce these factors. Most of the loadings\nwere above 0.71, which according to Comrey and\nLee29 are excellent.\nFactor 1 was labeled as \u201csexual infidelity.\u201d This\nfactor included both online and offline sexual acts,\nincluding offline sexual intercourse, cybersex, and\nhot chatting. Factor 2 was labeled \u201cemotional infi-\ndelity\u201d and included both online and offline shar-\ning of intimate details with a person of the opposite\nsex and developing a cross-sex non-sexual relation-\nship. Finally, factor 3 was labeled \u201cpornography\u201d\nand included viewing pornographic material both\nonline and offline, including on the web, via email,\n574 WHITTY\nTABLE 2.

Factor\nbased scales were derived by initially standardizing\neach variable using a z-transformation before sum-\nmating them.

Sexual infidelity correlated sig-\nnificantly with emotional infidelity (r = 0.41, p < 0.001)\nand pornography (r = 0.52, p < 0.001). Emotional in-\nfidelity correlated significantly with pornography\n(r = 0.41, p < 0.001). Gender was found to be signifi-\ncantly related to sexual infidelity (r = 0.23, p < 0.001),\nemotional infidelity (r = 0.08, p < 0.01), and pornog-\nraphy (r = 0.15, p < 0.001). Age was significantly re-\nlated to sexual infidelity (r = 20.15, p < 0.001) and\npornography (r = 20.15, p < 0.001). Internet sexual\nexperience was significantly related to sexual infi-\ndelity (r = 0.31, p < 0.001), emotional infidelity (r =\n0.13, p < 0.001), and pornography (r = 0.19, p < 0.001).\nRelationship status was significantly related to emo-\ntional infidelity (r = 20.06, p < 0.05).\nA MANOVA was performed using the dependent\nvariables sexual infidelity, emotional infidelity, and\npornography, and the independent variables were\ngender, age, relationship status, and Internet sexual\nexperience. (It should be noted that originally coun-\ntry of origin was to be included as a co-variate; how-\never, given that it was not significantly correlated\nwith the dependent variables, it was excluded from\nthe analysis.) Applying an a level of 0.05, there was\na statistically significant difference on the combined\ndependent variables for the interaction of gender\nby age F(6, 2182) = 2.21, p = 0.039; Wilks\u2019 Lambda =\n0.98; partial eta squared = 0.01, for the interaction of\nage by relationship status F(6, 2182) = 2.67, p = 0.014;\nWilks\u2019 Lambda = 0.99; partial eta squared = 0.01,\nand for Internet sexual experience F(3, 1091) = 13.21,\np < 0.001; Wilks\u2019 Lambda = 0.97; partial eta squared\n= 0.04. The dependent variables were then consid-\nered separately. It is noteworthy to point out that,\naccording to Cohen,30 these effect sizes are rela-\ntively small. Table 4 presents the significant uni-\nvariate F-tests, using a Bonferroni adjusted a level\nof 0.017.\nAn inspection of the mean scores for the factor\nsexual infidelity indicated that that those who stated\nthey had no Internet sexual experience (M = 1.42,\nSD = 5.39) scored higher than those with Internet\nsexual experience (M = 22.5, SD = 6.41). Further-\nmore, for the factor pornography those who stated\nthey had no Internet sexual experience (M = 0.52,\nSD = 3.88) scored higher than those with Internet\nsexual experience (M = 20.92, SD = 3.07).\nFigure 1 clearly shows an interaction between\ngender and age on the factor sexual infidelity. It\ndemonstrates that women overall were more likely\nto believe that sexual acts were an act of betrayal\nthan the men did. Overall, the younger group\n(17\u201322 years) believed that these sexual acts were\nacts of betrayal more than the older groups. The\n23\u201344-year-old men were also more likely to rate\nsexual infidelity higher than the oldest group of\nmen (45\u201370 years). However, the interaction effect\noccurred for the older women (45\u201370 years) who\nrated this factor higher than the 23\u201344-year-old\nwomen.\nFigure 2 shows an interaction between age and\nrelationship status on the factor sexual infidelity. The\nyounger individuals (17\u201322 years), who were cur-\nrently in a relationship, believed that these sexual\nacts were acts of betrayal more than the 17\u201322-\nyears-olds not in relationship. Moreover, the 17\u201322-\nyears-olds in a relationship rated this factor higher\nthan any other individuals. Interestingly, this pat-\ntern is reversed for the 23\u201344-years-olds, where\nthose who were not in a relationship were more in-\nclined to rate the factor sexual infidelity as an act of\nbetrayal, compared to the 23\u201344-year-olds in a rela-\ntionship. Again, contrasting results occur for the\n45\u201370-year-olds, where those individuals not in a\nrelationship rate this factor the lowest compared to\nother individuals; however, the drop in scores was\nnot as dramatic for the 45\u201370-year-olds in a rela-\ntionship.\nPUSHING THE WRONG BUTTONS 575\nTABLE 4.

An inspection\nof the means for each of the individual items, prior\nto the factor analysis, suggests that some acts, such\nas sexual acts both offline and online, pose a greater\nthreat than other acts such as viewing pornogra-\nphy. This is an interesting finding, given that physi-\ncal bodies are not actually touching each other\nduring the sexual online encounters, and in fact,\nmore visual nudity is probably available for those\nviewing pornography. What does this mean about\nindividuals\u2019 perception of infidelity? It is perhaps\nnot the amount of physical contact or the idea that\none\u2019s partner is masturbating, but rather that their\npartner has desire for another and is seeking out a\nsexual encounter with an individual other than\nthemselves. This is in line with Yarab et al.\u2019s9 claim\nthat, when considering sexual fantasies, the greater\nthe threat of the sexual fantasy to the relationship,\nthe more likely the fantasy is considered to be un-\nfaithful. It is probable that participants perceived\nthat sexual acts such as cybersex and hot chatting\nwere more of a threat than pornography, since they\nare more likely to meet face to face with their cyber-\nloves than they are with porn stars.\nAn interestingly and important finding from this\nstudy was that the factor analysis revealed that there\nare separate components of infidelity that we need\nto consider, these being sexual infidelity, emotional\ninfidelity, and pornography. This too fits with other\ntheorists\u2019 understanding that we need to consider\nother aspects besides sexual intercourse as acts of\ninfidelity.8 However, what is unique to this study is\nthe finding that online acts of betrayal do not fall\ninto a discrete category of their own. As can be seen\nin the factor analysis, each factor consisted of both\nonline and offline acts of infidelity.\nThe findings from this study challenge the notion\nthat acts that occur in cyberspace cannot have a\n\u201creal\u201d impact on an individual\u2019s life. Many theo-\nrists have placed a strong emphasis on the absence\nof the body in cyberspace,31,32 focusing on cybersex\nas an action that does not involve the \u201creal presence\u201d\nof bodies. Such researchers focus on the importance\nof a \u201cmeeting of minds.\u201d In contrast, this study found\nthat individuals separate disclosing intimate details\nwith another online (emotional infidelity) and en-\ngaging in sexual activities (sexual infidelity) online\nwith another. This current study suggests that peo-\nple at least perceive online acts of infidelity as au-\nthentic and real as offline acts. Certainly, there are\nno physical bodies present online; however, this in\nturn does not mean that the action is \u201cunreal.\u201d In-\nstead, Internet relationships are better understood\nif we focus on the reconstruction of the body on-\nline, which is imperative to the success of many on-\nline interpersonal interactions.33 In line with this\nview, engaging in virtual erotic communications on-\nline with someone other than one\u2019s partner can pose\na real threat to couples.\nIn addition to the above explanation, whilst many\nsexual encounters do initiate online, it has been\nsuggested that a large proportion of individuals con-\ntinue these relationships offline.33\u201335 Previous work\nhas found that many individuals hope to eventu-\nally meet up face to face with their cyber-mates.33\n576 WHITTY\nFIG. 1. Interaction for gender age by age on sexual\ninfidelity.\nFIG. 2. Interaction for age by relationship status on\nsexual infidelity.\nWhitty and Gavin36 have argued that continuing a\nrelationship that initiated online to offline repre-\nsented increasing levels in trust and intimacy in a\nrelationship. Hence, it is likely that some individu-\nals see their partners\u2019 erotic interactions with another\non the Internet as a real threat to their relationship.\nThis study, in part, supported the hypotheses. It\nfound that women were more likely than men were\nto perceive sexual acts as violations of fidelity. This\nis not surprising considering the general agreement\nin the literature that women are more upset by off-\nline acts of infidelity compared to men. However,\ncontrary to previous studies,18 women in this study\ndid not score significantly higher than men did on\nextradyadic emotional behavior, or pornography.\nPerhaps the types of questions individuals are asked\ncan explain this difference. In this current study par-\nticipants were asked to rate items on infidelity, while\nothers18 have asked participants to rate how upset\nthey would be by these behaviors.\nAlthough we did find that women tended to rate\nsexual infidelity higher than men did, the results\nobtained in this study found an interesting gender\nby age interaction effect on sexual infidelity. That,\nin the main, younger people rated sexual acts as an\nact of betrayal more than older individuals; how-\never, the 45\u201370-year-old women considered this to\nbe the case more than the 23\u201344-year-old women.\nThese results do not support the age hypothesis\nformed for this study, that young people are more\nsexually liberated; but rather suggest the opposite\nto be the case. Of course, it is difficult to ascertain\nfrom a cross-sectional study whether these reflect\nage effects or cohort effects. Possibly the women\u2019s\nmovement has effected the cohort of 23\u201344-year-\nold women and the sexual counter-revolution have\nswung attitudes around to being more conserva-\ntive for the 17\u201322-year-olds.\nThis study also highlights the value in consid-\nering age differences and relationship status in\nattitudes towards sexual infidelity. An age by rela-\ntionship status interaction occurred for the factor\nsexual infidelity. There is a plausible explanation\nfor why younger people in a relationship rate sex-\nual acts of infidelity higher than other individuals.\nCourtship has been described as \u201ca \u2018trying-out\u2019 pe-\nriod that individuals use to assess the qualifications\nof each as a more permanent mate.\u201d37 These younger\nindividuals, who are more likely to be in a trying\nout phase in a relationship, are perhaps less tolera-\nble of any sexual form of betrayal. Interestingly, the\nresult is reversed for the older adults (23\u201344 years)\nwith those not in a relationship more likely to rate\nsexual as an act of betrayal than those in a relation-\nship. Moreover, the oldest individuals not in a rela-\ntionship (presumably some of which are widows)\nrated sexual acts of infidelity lower than any other\ngroup.\nAgain, it is important to recognize here the limi-\ntation of exploring age differences in isolation to\ncohort and historical effects. While the higher rat-\nings in infidelity from the younger individuals\nmight, in part, be explained by the sexual conserva-\ntive backlash, which has been a consequence of the\nAIDS epidemic, this cannot be confidently accounted\nfor in a cross-sectional design. Hence, future re-\nsearchers might consider carrying out longitudinal\nstudies on attitudes towards online and offline infi-\ndelity.\nAs predicted an Internet sexual experience dif-\nference was obtained. This occurred for two of the\nfactors: sexual infidelity and pornography. Perhaps\nthese individuals perceived these acts as less of a\nthreat, given that they are more aware of what these\nacts entail. Alternatively, perhaps they are more sex-\nually liberated and less prudish than the rest of the\npopulation. However, one wonders what their part-\nners would say if they were aware of their online\nsexual encounters.\nWhile this study does not claim to have all the\nanswers on what constitutes an act of infidelity, it\nhas revealed new gaps in the literature that need to\nbe taken-up in future studies. It should be noted\nthat the effect sizes were fairly small for many of\nthe significant differences obtained, suggesting that\nthere are other variables we also need to consider.\nFor example, in addition to sexual experience, \nfuture studies might consider offline sexual experi-\nence. A further breakdown in categories of relation-\nship status could also highlight some important\ndifferences. Other aspects of infidelity might also be\nconsidered. Future research might also find differ-\nences in levels of jealousy in respect to online acts,\nsince it might be the case that people feel jealous\nabout a certain behavior, but do not consider the\nbehavior to be a violation of fidelity.\nDespite these limitations, this study does present\nsome interesting findings on a topic that has great\nbearing on functioning in today\u2019s society. As the\nInternet increases as a popular means of communi-\ncation, researchers need to start seriously question-\ning how the use of this technology impacts on our\nevery day relationships. Obviously, such findings\nhighlight that any treatment rationale for infidelity\nwill need to consider that some online behaviors\ncan pose a real threat to relationships. Indeed, fur-\nther research of this kind is imperative if psycholo-\ngists are to be successful in counseling partners\nwho believe they have been betrayed by an online\naffair.\nPUSHING THE WRONG BUTTONS 577\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe author would like to thank Annete Ferrari,\nKatrina Sorenson, and Lizzy Gonzo for their assis-\ntance with this project. \nREFERENCES\n1.
