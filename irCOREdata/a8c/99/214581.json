It argues that public trust \nin policing is needed partly because this may result in public cooperation with justice, but \nmore importantly because public trust in justice builds institutional legitimacy and thus public \ncompliance with the law, and commitment to, the rule of law. Some recent survey findings \nare presented in support of this perspective. \n \nKey words: procedural justice; police legitimacy; compliance; trust in justice     \n \n \n 3 \nIdeas ebb and flow. In the 1970s and 1980s, both police leaders and academics routinely \nappealed to concepts of policing by consent and police legitimacy (cf Reiner, 1990). In the \nBritain of the 1990s these ideas were submerged under a wave of crude managerialism from \nwhich we are only now emerging (Hough, 2007). The last five years have seen a resurgence \nof interest in ensuring that the public find the police trustworthy and that police authority and \ninstitutional legitimacy is strengthened as a result.  \n \nThis paper analyses key concepts in \u2018procedural justice theory,\u2019 which we hope will prove \nuseful in thinking about stimulating public commitment to the rule of law. We have included \nsome preliminary analysis of a survey conducted for the National Policing Improvement \nAgency, which provides empirical support in a UK setting for the ideas that we present.  \n  \nProcedural justice theory \nPenal and criminal policy has always reflected tensions between simple \u2013 or even simplistic \u2013 \nmodels of crime control and ones that have more texture and depth. The key features of the \nsimple \u2018crime control\u2019 models are that: \n \n\u2022 people are rational-economic calculators in deciding whether to break the law; \n\u2022 deterrent threat is the main weapon in the armoury of criminal justice; \n\u2022 offenders \u2013 and thus crime rates \u2013 are responsive primarily to the risk of punishment, \nwhich can vary on dimensions of certainty, severity and celerity; \n\u2022 increasing the severity of sentencing, and extending the reach of enforcement \nstrategies, are therefore seen as sensible responses to crime; and,  \n\u2022 offender rights tend to be seen as a constraint on effective crime control. \n \nMore subtle models of crime control recognise that formal criminal justice is only one of \nmany systems of social control, most of which have a significant normative dimension. \nCriminology has given insufficient attention to questions about why people comply with the \nlaw, and too much attention to questions about why people break the law (cf Bottoms, 2002). \nThe imbalance is important, because questions about reasons for law-breaking tend \u2013 not \ninevitably but because of the political climate in which policy is developed \u2013 to yield answers \nframed within the boundaries of simple crime control models. They tend to imply approaches \nto crime control that are designed to secure instrumental compliance \u2013 that is, where people\u2019s \nreason for law-breaking are based on self-interested calculation. \n \nQuestions about compliance, by contrast, yield answers that recognise the interplay between \nformal and informal systems of social control, and in particular the normative dimensions in \npeople\u2019s orientation to the law. Normative compliance with the law occurs when people feel a \nmoral or ethical obligation or commitment to do so.  \nConcerned with people\u2019s compliance with institutional authority, procedural justice theories \npropose specific relationships between: \n \n\u2022 the treatment people receive at the hand of the police and justice officials; \n\u2022 the resultant trust that people have in institutions of justice; \n\u2022 the legitimacy people confer, as a consequence of this trust, on institutions of justice;  \n\u2022 the authority that these institutions can then command when they are regarded as \nlegitimate; and, \n\u2022 people\u2019s consequent preparedness to obey the police, comply with the law and cooperate \nwith justice.  \n \nLegitimacy is a central concept in procedural justice theory. There are two uses of the term. \nPolitical philosophers often talk of political systems as achieving legitimacy when they meet \nvarious agreed objective criteria. Think, for example, of the presence of a democratic system \nof election, adherence by both rulers and the governed to the rule of law and the absence of \n 4 \nendemic corruption. Experts can, for instance, judge the Zimbabwean justice system to lack \nlegitimacy, since by any objective standard it is corrupt and lacks public accountability. \nAssessments of this sort also involve subjective judgements, of course, about the nature of the \n\u2018good or just society.\u2019   \n \nBut there is a separate set of questions about the ability of a criminal justice system to \ncommands legitimacy in the eyes of the public  - whether the policed see the police as \nlegitimate. These questions are open and empirical. Leaving aside whether that system \nactually meets any given set of objective (or ethical\/normative) criteria, they turn our \nattention to surveys and qualitative methods of research, which give us insight into public \nattitudes, values, behaviours and beliefs. \n \nPerceived legitimacy exists when the policed regard the authorities as having earned an \nentitlement to command, creating in themselves an obligation to obey.  If people willingly \noffer their obedience to systems of authority that command legitimacy, questions about the \n\u2018drivers\u2019 of legitimacy become of central policy importance. Intriguingly, it is possible to \nhave a system of governance that commands high levels of perceived legitimacy from the \ngoverned whilst also, paradoxically, failing to meet the criteria of legitimacy that political \nphilosophers would generally accept. Examples are to be found in many totalitarian and \nrevolutionary regimes in their early phases.  \n \nThere is a growing body of \u2013 largely North American \u2013 research evidence in support of \nprocedural justice theories (cf Tyler and Huo, 2002; Tyler, 2003; Tyler, 2007).). Contrasting \ninstrumental and normative models of compliance, Tyler argues that normative compliance is \neconomically more viable, and is more stable over time, than instrumental compliance, which \n\u2013 in the US context at least \u2013 carries a growingly unaffordable social and fiscal cost. (The \ncase for such an approach will be strengthened, of course, as the need to reduce public \nexpenditure becomes more pressing over the years ahead.)  \n \nOn the basis of various surveys of the public, Tyler has demonstrated that public perceptions \nof the fairness of the justice system in the United States are more significant in shaping its \nlegitimacy than perceptions that it is effective. An important distinction here is between a \nsense of justice based on process and one based on outcome. Tyler\u2019s findings suggest that \nprocedural justice \u2013 that is, fair and respectful treatment that \u2018follows the rules\u2019 \u2013 is more \nimportant to people than obtaining outcomes that that they regard either as fair or favourable \nto themselves. In other words, in encounters with the police it is the quality of treatment \nreceived that is more important than the objective outcome.  \n \nTyler\u2019s main focus has been on the interactions between officials and the public, and the ways \nthat the behaviour of officials builds or erode institutional legitimacy. But there are other, \nmore complex, dimensions to legitimacy. As Beetham (1991) has argued, people confer \nlegitimacy on institutions not simply because the latter adhere to standards of good behaviour, \nbut because they regard the institutions as representing particular normative and ethical \nframeworks. Conferring legitimacy on an institution is also therefore an act based on the \nexpression of shared values, or of \u2018moral alignment.\u2019 Institutional legitimacy flows not simply \nfrom factors such as its procedural fairness but is also based in public perceptions that police \nand policed share broadly similar moral positions.  \n \nThis is not to say that to be considered legitimate police must enforce laws that all citizens \nagree with. Rather, police must demonstrate \u2018moral authority,\u2019 embodying a shared sense of \nright and wrong. (This does not require them to be moralists, or to demonstrate moral \nsuperiority, but it requires them to negotiate order in a way that maximises consent.) To \nBeetham, this sense of moral alignment is central \u2013 a necessary component of legitimate \nauthority. By extension, according to the procedural justice model the sense of a shared moral \n 5 \nposition is communicated to citizens by the police through the quality of their behaviour in \nspecific interactions, and in particular through their procedural fairness \u2013 or lack of it.  \n \nAccording to Tyler\u2019s process-based policing model (Sunshine & Tyler, 2003), legitimacy then \ngenerates compliance with the law, first because people grant society (and its justice system) \nthe right to dictate appropriate ways to behave: while we may disagree with some of these \nlaws, we nevertheless obey them because we think complying with the authority that enacted \nthem is the right thing to do. And second, if individuals see the police as lacking \u2018moral fibre\u2019 \n\u2013 most importantly by behaving in manifestly unfair ways \u2013 then can make the public cynical \nabout the law. According to Sampson & Bartusch (1998: 786) legal cynicism is the sense that \n\u2018\u2026laws or rules are not considered binding in the existential, present lives of respondents\u2019, \nand the \u2018\u2026ratification of acting in ways that are \u201coutside\u201d of laws and social norms.\u2019  \n \nThe police are the most visible agent of social control and the most high-profile institution in \na justice system that is empowered to define right and wrong behaviour. If the police abuse \ntheir powers and wield their authority in unfair ways, this can not only damage people\u2019s sense \nof obligation to obey their directives (their authority in the normal sense of the word); it can \nalso damage public perceptions of their moral authority and therefore the moral right of the \nlaw to dictate appropriate behaviour. Put another way, if the police are seen to act in ways \noutside of social norms \u2013 which dictate that such authorities should treat the people they serve \nwith fairness and dignity \u2013 then this generates a powerful cynicism: \u2018if the police can behave \nhowever they please, and ignore the rules, so can I.\u2019 \n \nTesting procedural justice theory in the UK \nThe National Policing Improvement Agency recently fielded core questions on public trust \nand police legitimacy in a representative sample-survey of England and Wales. The survey \nallows us to test what relationships exist between measures of public trust in the police, \nmeasures of perceived legitimacy and people\u2019s self-reported compliance with the law and \ncooperation with the police.  Figure 1 summarises emerging findings. (These findings will be \nreported more fully in due course.) \n \nFigure 1: Public trust and police legitimacy in England and Wales \n \n  \n \nFirst, consider the distinction between instrumental and normative compliance. The \ninstrumental route to compliance is where people comply with the law because the police \n 6 \npresent a powerful risk of sanction and punishment. By contrast, the normative route is where \npeople comply with the law not out of fear of punishment but because they feel they ought to.  \n \nHere, the NPIA data are unequivocal: while trust in police effectiveness is an important \npredictor of people\u2019s sense of the risk of sanction, the perceived risk of sanction is not a \nsignificant factor in compliance with the law. Thus the NPIA data do not offer any support for \nthe simple deterrence-based models of crime control outlined above. This suggests that \ndeterrence is not the quickest route to securing compliance.  \n \nSecond, trust in the police was an extremely powerful predictor of perceived legitimacy. The \nexperience of procedural fairness fosters in people feelings of motive-based trust in (and \nshared group membership with) the authority concerned \u2013 that both it and they are \u2018on the \nsame side.\u2019 The manner in which people \u2013 as members of social groups \u2013 are treated by those \nin authority communicates information to them about their status within those groups. When \npolice provide individuals with appropriate status information (through fair procedures), they \nare more likely to feel a sense of obligation to the police and more likely to feel aligned with \nthe ethical and moral framework they believe the police to embody. That is, they are more \nlikely to perceive the police to be legitimate. \n \nThird, police legitimacy is a powerful predictor of compliance, even holding constant \npersonal morality. Importantly, a good deal of this statistical effect is mediated through legal \ncynicism. The ways in which the police wield their authority in part generates their perceived \nlegitimacy, and if they treat people unfairly, legitimacy suffers and people become cynical \nabout human nature and legal systems of justice. This then leads them to view certain laws \nand social norms as not personally binding. \n \nFinally, public cooperation with the police was also strongly predicted by legal cynicism, \nperceived police legitimacy and personal morality. Such cooperation is for the police just as \nimportant an outcome of legitimacy as is the perceived obligation to obey and compliance \nwith the law. Without the cooperation of the public policing in developed democracies would \nbecome essentially unworkable. Acts of cooperation may also serve to cement the relationship \nbetween police and public and promote the view that addressing crime is a collaborative \nprocess, and not just about delivering services.  \n \nProcedural justice beyond the English-speaking world \nOne criticism of procedural justice model is that it has been most often applied in English-\nspeaking countries with common-law legal systems. Will it \u2018work\u2019 in other contexts, such as \ncontinental Europe, where legal systems and the position of the police within them, are often \nvery different? Such questions are of particular relevance given the ever-increasing pluralism \nand mobility of the modern world. Will the methods implied by \u2018process-based\u2019 policing, and \nthe ends they aim for, \u2018work\u2019 across, and within, diverse multi-cultural situations?  \n \nTo answer these (and other) questions, we are currently mounting an empirical test of our \nown elaboration of procedural justice theory using the European Social Survey. This will \ninvolve interviews with around 40,000 European adults in 30 countries in the Autumn of 2010. \nWe have designed a battery of questions, which will allow us to create scales measuring the \nvarious concepts in which we are interested. We shall then be able to assess whether the \nrelationships which we posit between these concepts actually hold up in practice.  \n \nRound 5 of the ESS will give us measures of public trust in fairness, effectiveness and shared \nvalues for both the police and the courts. We expect these to predict public perceptions of \npolice and court legitimacy to varying degrees. One of our key hypotheses is that across \nEurope, trust in effectiveness is a less powerful shaper of legitimacy than trust in fairness and \nshared values. We expect our measures of legitimacy to predict people\u2019s stated preparedness \nto comply with the law, and with their preparedness to cooperate with the police and courts. \n 7 \nFinally, and crucially, we hypothesise that perceived risks of punishment will only weakly \npredict public compliance and cooperation. As with our analysis of the NPIA data, we shall \ntest the idea that instrumental strategies for securing compliance with the law, working \nlargely through deterrent principles, may be less powerful than those which operate through \nnormative mechanisms.  \n \nVariations between countries \nWhilst we expect that the broad patterns of relationships between trust, perceived legitimacy \nand compliance will be consistent across Europe, we think it likely that perceptions of \nlegitimacy will have different drivers (or predictors) in different countries. Without wishing to \nprejudge outcomes, some of the countries that have recently joined the European Community \nface serious problems of corruption, which may have highly unpredictable effects on \nperceptions of legitimacy. It is hard to see how uncontrolled corruption is compatible with \nlegitimate authority \u2013 yet contained and low-level corruption that follows well-established \ninformal rules may be tolerated or even appreciated by some sectors of the population (c.f. \nTankebe, 2010).  \n \nWe also expect to find that Nordic countries, with their generally cohesive communities and \nhigh levels of trust in political institutions, will also have high levels of trust in institutions of \njustice; we expect this to be reflected in institutions of justice that command high levels of \nlegitimacy  - which would go some way to explaining the relatively low levels of crime in \nthese countries.  \n \nWe suspect that Britain could prove something of an outlier, given the extent to which the \n\u2018Bobby\u2019 has historically been taken to be a symbol of particularly British values \u2013 of decency \nand of fair play, combined with pragmatism and the spirit of compromise.1 It could be that the \nBritish police are still living off the income from this inherited cultural capital, and that our \nEuropean neighbours, such as the French, have much lower expectations of those who they \nregard as state functionaries. On the other hand, our findings may show that the relationships \nbetween trust, legitimacy and compliance are actually rather stable across cultures and \njurisdictions, at least within Europe and North America.   \n \nThe quality of evidence from the ESS and similar surveys \nSnapshot surveys of the general public can demonstrate the presence or absence of statistical \nassociation between different sets of attitudes and beliefs. This is not the same as \ndemonstrating the presence of causal relationships. It will always be hard to assemble \nabsolutely clinching evidence that fair and respectful treatment of the public builds legitimacy \nand thus consent to the rule of law. However, there may be scope for testing a range of \nprocedural justice hypotheses more rigorously (for example see Paternoster et al. 1997). In \nthe meantime, we are hopeful that a research study such as ours that can exploit the natural \ncultural and legal variations across Europe will create genuinely new insights into the \ndifferent ways in which institutional legitimacy is constructed and maintained (or lost) in \nindustrialised, late-modern countries. Equally, our hypotheses may be proved to be plain \nwrong. \n \nAssuming, optimistically, that we are proved to be more right than wrong, it will always be \npossible to build alternative explanations for our findings that are outside of the procedural \njustice framework elaborated in this paper. However, we envisage this research as a process \nof scientific hypothesis testing and theory building. That is: \n \n\u2022 we have elaborated a theory about processes of social control; \n\u2022 we have derived a set of hypotheses derived from our theory; and, \n\u2022 we have designed a cross-cultural test of these hypotheses. \n                                                 \n1\n We express no opinion as to whether this is, or was, delusional ethnocentrism.  \n 8 \n \nWe think that if our hypotheses survive empirical, this process confers more credibility on \nthem than alternative explanations designed after the event to fit the pattern of findings that \nwe observe.  \n \nIs this body of work important for policing and penal policy? \nThe growing visibility of procedural justice theory within criminology strikes us as important, \nin particular because of its potential impact on policy. It is arguable whether the marked \ntendency towards penal populism amongst UK and US politicians is part of a universal trend \namongst developed countries. The pessimistic view (which we share) is that structural \nfeatures of late-modernity place many European countries at risk of the same processes as we \nhave seen in this country: the emergence of an increasingly crude discourse about crime \ncontrol which emphasises: \n \n\u2022 \u2018common sense\u2019 strategies for securing instrumental (or situational2) compliance \nfrom \u2018criminals\u2019; \n\u2022 sharp distinctions between \u2018criminals\u2019 and the \u2018law abiding majority\u2019 \n\u2022 greater responsiveness to the wishes of the \u2018law-abiding majority; and, \n\u2022 greater responsiveness to the needs of victims. \n \nThis discourse tends to characterise rights as a \u2018zero sum game\u2019 in which rights of offenders \nare in tension with those of victims and the \u2018law-abiding majority. Being \u2018on the side of the \nvictim\u2019 within this discourse equates with a preparedness to shave away the rights of suspects \nand defendants. Procedural justice theory suggests that this is likely to be counterproductive: \nif the justice system ignores the rights and entitlements of \u2018the policed\u2019, this creates the \npotential for a growing deficit in legitimacy which shows itself in reduced compliance with \nthe law. The policing of ethnic minority groups in the UK in the 1960s, 70s and 80s may \nprovide one example of how police practice works alongside other social and cultural forces \nto foster among some people from those communities exactly the sense of legal cynicism \noutlined above. \n \nIn an over-simplified discourse about crime control \u2013 as we increasingly see in the UK \u2013 the \nrationale for improving \u2018confidence in justice\u2019 is that greater consumer satisfaction on the \npart of the \u2018law-abiding majority\u2019 will secure their cooperation with the authorities \u2013 through \nreporting of crimes, and acting as witnesses etc. \u2013 thus enhancing the deterrent effectiveness \nof the system. A procedural justice perspective would direct attention to \u2018confidence \nbuilding\u2019 amongst those parts of the population whose commitment to the rule of law is more \ntentative, the primary purpose being to secure compliance first, and cooperation second. It \nwould also allude to the fact that the \u2018law-abiding majority\u2019 also commit crime, and that in \nany case they too care more about fair procedure than effectiveness narrowly defined. All \navailable evidence suggests that fostering trust and legitimacy via fair and decent treatment \nwould pay dividends across the population. \n \nIn making this case to senior police officers, we have often received the reaction that these \ndistinctions are of minor importance, in that we are all \u2018on the same page\u2019 in wanting to \nimprove the professionalism with which the police handle the public, and that treating people \nwith fairness and respect is a shared goal. However, there is an important difference, which is \nworth emphasising. The government rationale for improving confidence is based on \nreciprocity, where responsive policing buys public cooperation, but offers no guidance about \nthe treatment of law-breakers and those at risk of law-breaking. The procedural justice \nrationale by contract focusses attention precisely on these groups whose compliance with the \nlaw is problematic, and actually provides a rationale for explaining why the criminal justice \n                                                 \n2\n It makes sense to view incapacitative or preventative sentencing as a way of securing situational rather than \ninstrumental compliance. \n 9 \nsystem should actually treat justice as the central product of the system. It provides a \nvocabulary for explaining why fairness and rights \u2013 for everyone \u2013 are important.  \n \nWe have suggested in this paper that the narrow instrumentalism of \u2018crime fighting\u2019 discourse \nsupports and is supported by the managerialism that has characterised the last fifteen years of \nUK government policy. New Public Management demands simplicity in thinking about \npolicing, and simple thinking about policing makes NPM appear appropriate for policing. Of \ncourse, the two may not be so tightly connected as we imagine. It may be that the principles \nof procedural justice find favour with politicians, but that NPM is still seen as the means of \nbringing about the necessary changes. Our own view is that NPM is in important ways \nincompatible with procedural justice approaches to policing that are sensitive to normative \nand moral issues: to treat people with fairness and respect, police officers need genuinely to \nvalue fair treatment and genuinely to respect those who they police.  Drilling them to adopt \nthe skin-deep courtesy that is encountered at supermarket checkouts will always be, in our \nview, a \u2018second best\u2019. Of course this raises perennial issues about the balance between \nleadership and management control in policing, whose resolution lies beyond the scope of this \npaper.   \n     \n 10 \nReferences  \n \nBeetham, D.
