The infrastructure \nranges from field maps and notebooks, compasses and microscopes, to downhole loggers, seismic \nrecorders, and the drafting, printing and publication industries. Reflecting the exponential growth \nand plummeting costs of computing power, storage capacity and communications bandwidth, the \ninfrastructure is increasingly based on information and communications technology. So far, this \ncyberinfrastructure largely mimics familiar procedures, with little direct impact on the nature of the \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  1\ngeologists\u2019 work. Nevertheless, it may soon transform the environment for conducting geoscience. \nGeologists must consider the implications in order to guide the response of their science. \nA plausible, wide-ranging vision of the developing cyber-environment is based on the so-called \nGrid (Foster and Kesselman, 2003), which would supply digital information as a commodity, \nsimilar to the way in which the electricity grid delivers power. It could lead to a global system of \ninterconnected representations of knowledge where irrelevant boundaries of place and discipline \nlose their significance. Items of information from many sources can be extensively linked in a Grid-\nbased system. The content can be structured to support reuse of items in different contexts, with \ncomputer-readable descriptions (ontologies) and paths of linked activities (workflows) that lead to \nmore consistent, flexible and economical representations. These representations will potentially be \naccessible at the user\u2019s desktop or digital field notebook, where information from many sources \ncould be assembled to work together as an integrated whole. For brevity, the term \u2018Grid\u2019 is used \nhere in a broad sense to refer to an advanced cyberinfrastructure based on these concepts. \nIn this paper, the consequences are looked at from the viewpoint of a geological survey. They affect \nits business model (why the work is done), the surveying procedures (how it is done), and the \nframework (the structure that relates the components of geological information). The framework is \nthe focus of this review. It is required in order to integrate, communicate and understand the \nmultifaceted information, providing a shared logical structure for relating items through \nclassification and organization.  The framework should foster the collaborative nature of science by \nencouraging individuals and organizations to work together in building a shared system of \nknowledge, with standards to ease communication. If we can design one coherent, integrated \nframework for the geoscience component of a global knowledge system, then individual projects \ncan be constructed as steps towards the collective goal of better understanding. It should support \nrevised business models, changes in geological surveying procedures to match emerging \nopportunities, and services that provide users with products to meet their specific needs. \nWe suggest that a suitable framework can be based on a model of the systems of the solid Earth: a \nsolid Earth systems model (sEsm). \u2018Model\u2019 is used in the sense of a conceptual construct \nrepresenting a simplified view of some aspect of reality for a particular purpose. \u2018System\u2019 is used in \nthe sense of a set of interacting parts operating as a whole, organized to perform a particular \nfunction. Just as metadata can be thought of as data describing more detailed data, so the framework \nmight be thought of as a metamodel, or a model describing the sEsm. Within the overall systems \nmodel, there is of course an extensive hierarchy of component subsystems and component models \nthat are concerned with more specific aspects and with their interactions. \nThe informal diagrams illustrating various aspects of the system of geoscience knowledge may help \nto clarify the issues involved, at the risk of oversimplifying a complex situation. They (Figs. 1-5) \nare intended to indicate the various components of the system and their linkages, and to suggest \nhow they might relate to the global knowledge system potentially supported by the Grid. They aim \nto clarify how digital components can work alongside existing knowledge, build on existing \nprocedures, make them more effective, and encourage the introduction of improved methods for \nsurveying. The arrows indicate the flow of information through the system. \nGeological survey agencies take a comprehensive view of the basic geology of a region and are \ntherefore well placed to take a lead in defining the framework. Preparation for Grid-based \ngeological survey is timely, because evolution of the cyberinfrastructure is proceeding at a pace that \nsurveying agencies cannot match. However, the design must involve geologists and earth scientists \ngenerally, as well as users of geological information. This paper is directed primarily at \ngeoscientists, aiming to clarify the requirement for a framework and provoke deeper consideration \nof possible responses. It considers how geologists extend their existing knowledge by the process of \nsurveying in section 2, the mechanisms for sharing information in section 3, the opportunities \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  2\noffered by the Grid and their consequences in section 4, and some steps towards implementation in \nsection 5. Technical solutions are not considered in this paper, but in practical terms, the delivery \nmechanisms for geological survey products must attempt to keep pace with mainstream acceptance \nof cyberinfrastructure tools.  \n \n2 Gathering knowledge \n2.1 Background knowledge \nThe system of geoscience knowledge has many interacting aspects that should work together as a \nwhole to maintain a configuration that best describes, predicts and makes available salient aspects \nof observable geology. It should respond to the evolution of relevant aspects of knowledge, \ncontrolled by the self-adjusting mechanisms known as feedback. A Grid-based system implies \nwider sharing of knowledge, and significant changes to its representation, structure and handling. \nTo see how wider sharing can be achieved, we need to develop a considered opinion on how the \nsystem works now, what should change, and what must be preserved. For present purposes, we \nneed to identify aspects that must be kept in mind in designing the framework, starting with the \nknowledge already in the geologist\u2019s mind, followed by the objectives and procedures of surveying \nthat extend that knowledge, using existing information records and creating new ones. \nThe greater part of the knowledge in the system is not recorded at all, but is held in the collective \nhuman memory \u2013 the background knowledge (on left of Fig. 1) of the human contributors and users \nof geoscience knowledge, acquired by training, education and experience. If we think of that \nknowledge as originating and existing in human brains, then information might be seen as a means \nof representing aspects of it, which can then be recorded, stored and communicated, ultimately \ninteracting with knowledge in the recipient\u2019s mind. There is much philosophical debate on what \nknowledge is, the mechanisms by which representations of it are expressed and communicated as \ninformation, the terminology to describe it, and how much is unexpressed or even inexpressible. \nThe main point here, however, is that the basic design aim in a Grid-based geoscience knowledge \nsystem is to improve the mechanisms that handle and supply information to assist human thought \nprocesses. The complicated interactions between background knowledge and recorded information \nare therefore relevant to the framework design.  \nWalsham (2005) provides an accessible review on knowledge communication. He builds on ideas \nfrom Polanyi and Giddens, and provides a range of related references. He argues that each of us has \ndifferent tacit knowledge of the world in which we live, the outcome of active shaping of \nexperience undertaken in the pursuit of knowledge. \u2018Tacit\u2019 knowledge (from the Latin tacitus, \nmeaning silent) is understood or implied without being directly expressed. It cannot be captured, \ntranslated or converted but only displayed or manifested in what we do. Subsidiary aspects for \ncommunication, such as gestures, speech, text narrative, formulae, maps, or graphs, have no \nmeaning unless rooted in this deeper knowledge. Walsham maintains that in communicating these \nsubsidiary aspects (information), the results of action and reflection are \u2018re-presented\u2019 in such a way \nthat they can be \u2018read\u2019 by others (transplanting their sense into the cultivated seed-bed of the \nrecipient\u2019s own tacit knowledge) and interpreted by them in terms of action and reflection. They are \ndeeply involved in human processes of communication that cannot be divorced from their context. \nHe argues (page 16) that the system must enable effective interaction between people with different \ntacit power and understanding, and should be concerned with disputed opinions as well as \nconsensus views. In the present case, the framework design should take into consideration that not \nall geologists have the same background understanding and not all agree on every interpretation. \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  3\nMany aspects of geological fieldwork depend on tacit, procedural knowledge that is learned from \nexperience and demonstration rather than verbal instruction (Loudon, 2000, page A90). For \nexample, a trained eye might readily correlate one outcrop with others by comparing it with hand \nspecimens from nearby exposures, but be unable to do so from the most exhaustive description. \nMechanisms for consultation with experts are thus part of the knowledge system, and are essential \nfor communicating unexpressed knowledge. \nWalsham (2005) provides references to the literature on knowledge communities, and communities \nof practice within organizations and between people in different organizations, coming together \nacross boundaries to learn and \u2018share\u2019 knowledge on particular topics. He draws on Giddens\u2019 \nstructuration theory, with its three inextricably linked aspects: how things are represented in \ncommunities (interpretive schemes), what is represented and for whom (norms), and who requires \nwhat information for what purposes (power relations).  \nThis sociological view of knowledge sharing is relevant to the detailed design of future knowledge \nmanagement systems, in particular to the mechanisms for monitoring the scientific validity and \nutility of the products in a global context, and for assessing the value that users and funding bodies \nplace on each part and item of the geoscience knowledge system and on the system as a whole. \nThese aspects are considered in section 3.1, in the context of the provenance and procedures for \nacquiring the knowledge. \n \n \nFigure 1: The geoscience knowledge system. Salient aspects of the real world, selected by \nprediction from background knowledge in accordance with a worldview and business \nmodel, are observed, and selectively described by conventional information records, for \naccess by users. The process is augmented now by digital access, potentially by a Grid-\nbased information system. \n \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  4\n2.2 Provenance \nUnderstanding an item of information (Minsky, 1981), whether obtained by observation or from an \nexisting record, requires it to be placed in a frame of reference (the context of relevant aspects of \nbackground knowledge). For perfect communication, the information supplier and user must share \nthe same frame. Inevitably, however, they have separate viewpoints and sets of objectives. Kent \n(1978, pages 202-203) pointed out that no two people perceive reality in exactly the same way, and \neach can take conflicting views at different (or indeed the same) times. This can cause confusion, \nbut also makes possible reconciliation, which he defines as a state in which the parties involved \nagree to a shared view relevant to the limited purpose at hand. He points out that reconciliation is an \nevery-day tactic for narrow purposes, but as more parties interact for wider purposes, discrepancies \nin fundamental assumptions will become increasingly apparent. \nMembers of an information community, such as a geological survey, fine-tune the alignment of \ntheir frames of reference as a learning process while working together. Similarly, geologists gain \ninsight into the background knowledge of the users of their work, and therefore of suitable forms \nfor communicating information to them. The move to a Grid-based system will greatly increase the \nvolume and diversity of information and frames of reference. For example, the background \nknowledge and priorities of geological investigations supporting civil engineering differ \nconsiderably from those directed at oil exploration. Only by understanding attributes of the \ninformation\u2019s provenance (where it came from), can the originator and user of information align \ntheir background knowledge by a temporary partial overlap of their viewpoints. This enables them \nto extract information from other sources that is relevant for their own purposes.  \nGeological surveyors predict from their existing knowledge where and how they can best make \nobservations of the solid Earth. As they predict and observe (Fig. 1), they learn more, modifying \nand adding to salient (important and meaningful) aspects of their background knowledge. Typically, \nsurveying proceeds as a set of projects (managed activities with objectives, resources and structure). \nEach project may have its own investigational design, including such aspects as instrumentation and \nsampling schemes. The design guides selective abstraction during observation, recording, \ndescription and explanation. The information may be acquired by mechanical data collection \nfollowing predetermined procedures (as in some geophysical and geochemical studies), or from \nmore flexible, holistic, surveying procedures (section 2.3), but in both cases the procedures are \ndirected by existing knowledge.  \nRelevant data (Fig. 1) on the worldview (the context as seen by the investigators), business model \n(the objectives behind the investigation and the means of achieving them), project objectives, and \ninvestigational design describe the provenance (how the information came into being).  The \nprovenance should be recorded and made available as metadata to assist in defining valid \napplications and in reconciling information from various sources. Future digital field support \nsystems could record such information as the fieldwork proceeds. Differences in provenance and \nprocedures may be essential for efficiency and for the evolution of new techniques and \ninterpretations. But a shared overall framework and standardized ontologies can help to avoid \npointless and unnecessary variation, and the metadata can assist reconciliation and provide a context \nin which disputed issues might be defined and perhaps resolved.  \n2.3 Procedures and reasoning \nAs shown in Fig. 1, background knowledge is linked to observation of the solid Earth, to the \ninvestigational design, to conventional information records, and potentially to a Grid-based \ninformation system. Many diverse designs apply to geological investigations, but the business \nmodels of most geological survey agencies share a common purpose, with wide scope and range of \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  5\napplication. This purpose is to develop, record, maintain and communicate an authoritative, \ncoherent account of the geology of a region. It is achieved by integration (through reconciliation) of \nknowledge from relevant available sources. The field geologist maps the structure and boundaries \nof the areas thought to be underlain by predetermined stratigraphic classes, in accordance with \nmany lines of observation and reasoning (Harrison, 1963, page 227), such as systematic field \nobservation and measurement of salient geoscience properties at sparse outcrops, establishing \npossible continuity with similar material nearby and correlation with prototypes (type sections), \nreconciliation with other sources of information, and analysis and interpretation of the properties in \nthe context of the rock types they characterize. The emphasis is generally on understanding the \nnature, distribution, history and configuration of the rock types, required as background information \nfor a wide range of commercial, regulatory and research activities. Conventionally, this has centered \non the lithostratigraphic map and its explanation.  \nAt each stage of investigation, geological surveyors take a top-down view, look carefully at the \nmany aspects of what they know so far, and imagine how the situation might be in its entirety. Field \ngeologists thus gain the necessary holistic understanding. It could be argued that they follow gestalt \nprinciples, including closure, similarity, proximity and continuity, which have much wider \napplications, for example in computer visualization (Skaalid, 1999), and that interpretation and \nvisualization might be regarded as related aspects of a single process. It is this comprehensive view \nthat gives the lithostratigraphic map its core significance in geoscience. \nActively seeking the most informative observations, the geologists refine their space-filling \ninterpretation, for which they must rely on understanding beyond their limited observations and \nincomplete evidence. They are likely to avoid a predetermined, rigid sampling scheme, and instead \nfollow an exploratory approach, modified as the survey progresses and more is learned. An item of \ninformation, regarded by the surveyor as an uncertain prediction from an evolving interpretation, \nshould not be seen by the user, or incorporated in the user\u2019s model, as isolated factual data, but must \nconnect to the context that gives it meaning. \nSurveying reduces the unimaginable quantity of information inherent in the solid Earth to a \nmanageable amount of information, which initially contributes to the knowledge in the surveyor\u2019s \nmind. The results may be jotted down, as ephemeral records for the surveyor\u2019s own use, or \nreworked in the geologist\u2019s mind to extract information that can be shared informally with \ncolleagues. Each geologist is an originator and a user of shared information, perhaps both at the \nsame time. The functions \u2018originate\u2019 and \u2018use\u2019 are shown separately in Fig. 1 to distinguish the roles \n(not the individuals) at the boundary between background knowledge and shared information. \nInformation is evaluated as part of the recording process, and some reconciliation of viewpoints \nmay be needed to use records that originated in another context \u2013 activities that require human \ncontrol. \nIn field mapping, geologists are concerned with the configuration of objects and their properties in \npresent-day space. An object can be regarded as the representation of an entity or thing of interest, \nan object instance refers to an actual occurrence of that object, and an object class is a category to \nwhich instances can be assigned within a defined, usually hierarchical, classification scheme. In \nclassifying geological objects, such as the rock-types depicted on a lithostratigraphic map, the \nsurveyors assess and take into account their interpretation of the genesis and historical development \nof the present-day geology.  \nThe interpretations and explanations are rooted in concepts of object configurations in the \ngeological past, and the processes and events that created and transformed them, leading eventually \nto the state and configuration of the present-day objects. Geology is a historical science. \u201cThe \nunchanging properties of matter and energy and the likewise unchanging processes and principles \narising therefrom are immanent in the material universe. They are nonhistorical, even though they \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  6\noccur and act in the course of history. The actual state of the universe or of any part of it at a given \ntime, its configuration, is not immanent and is constantly changing . . . History may be defined as \nconfigurational change through time, i.e. a sequence of real, individual but interrelated events. \nThese distinctions between the immanent and the configurational and between the nonhistorical and \nthe historical are essential to clear analysis and comprehension of history and of science.\u201d \n(Simpson, 1963, page 24).  \nThe idea of immanent processes and changing configurations fits well with the concept of emergent \nsystems, which create patterns that appear to arise spontaneously through the interaction of adjacent \nparts according to simple rules, without central control (Van Wagoner et al., 2003, Nicolis and \nPrigogine, 1989). The rules may stay the same, but the behavior of a complex system of this kind is \nunpredictable in detail because of the influence of feedback effects. Nevertheless, it tends to evolve \nto a preferred pattern, often within a hierarchical structure of self-similar patterns. The behavior of \nthe system as a whole cannot be explained by reducing the phenomena to simple parts controlled by \nmechanical processes governed by the deterministic laws of physical science. Instead we must, and \ndo, view the system holistically as a coherent organized whole. \nThe unchanging nature (invariance) in time and place of the mode of operation of geological \nprocesses, and the conservation of certain properties (mass, energy) is the basis for geological \nexplanation (\u201cThe present is the key to the past\u201d) and emphasizes the leading role of immanent \nprocesses in the knowledge system. Geological surveying therefore takes a model-based viewpoint, \nin which each object that the surveyor describes and records can be seen as an outcome of a likely \nscenario (a possible course of local operation of a geological-process model in its historical setting). \nThe model, as a holistic interpretation of the observed properties, has more weight in the \ninterpretation than the properties on their own. For example, siliceous grit directly overlying the \ngranite from which it had been eroded would not be mapped as part of the granite because, in spite \nof their contiguity and similarity of appearance and physical and chemical properties, they are the \nresults of quite different processes, far removed in time and environment \u2013 objects of similar \ncharacter, but the outcome of quite different scenarios. Thus the interpretations central to \ngeoscience surveying associate dynamic models of the geological past with their static present-day \noutcome. The resulting lithostratigraphic classification of rock types brings deeper understanding, \nand thus greater and more general predictive power, than a classification based solely on rock \nproperties. The properties alone may, of course, be sufficient where the product can be taken to \nimply the process. \nTo reduce the discomfort of basing scientific pronouncements on subjective interpretation, the \nnomenclature may be based on factual observation of the object\u2019s properties, with the advantage \nthat a change of opinion about the scenario need not require renaming the object. A line of \nreasoning may take objects as surrogates for the processes that formed them, and appear \nsuperficially to depend on the objects, not on the processes they are thought to imply. Thus, it might \nbe argued that a formation was deposited in deep water during a cold period, because of its large \nextent, graded bedding and sole marks (thought to indicate turbidity currents), and because it \nmerged in one direction with laterally extensive breccias and diamictites (thought to be slumped \nbeds) and in the opposite direction with fine siltstones, containing dispersed boulders (thought to be \nice-borne drop-stones). A full record of the reasoning, however, would include the links between \nobjects, processes and interpretation as a hypertext sequence, or workflow of the thought processes. \nA shared ontology could identify and re-use workflows to reduce redundancy, and simplify the \ndescription. Each thread of reasoning could be identified and described in an index (Fig. 4), \nalthough the networks of relationships through the objects and process-models of the knowledge \nsystem cannot readily be shown in a simple diagram. \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  7\nThe so-called semantic Web (Berners-Lee at al., 2001) and proposed semantic Grid (De Roure, \n2007) provide mechanisms to connect information to the underlying reasoning, and can relate \nmodels across disciplines through shared elements of the reasoning processes, the goal being \nsemantic interoperability. To take an example within geoscience, data in maps from gravity survey \nand in maps from geochemical analyses of stream sediments for the same area, cannot be correlated \ndirectly. Each might reflect the effects of, say, a hidden granite pluton, but one reflects the density \ndistribution at depth, while the other reflects mineralogical changes around the granite modified by \nlater stream transportation. Only by considering the meaning of the datasets from a shared \nviewpoint, in this case through a geological interpretation, can the results be reconciled and \nintegrated. \n \n3 Sharing information \n3.1 Evaluation \nSurveyors informally evaluate as they observe (weigh the relevance and importance of \nobservations), and commit selected information to memory, possibly supplemented by notes and \nsketches that may or may not eventually contribute to the permanent record. Processes such as \nabstraction, codification and reasoning (selectively reducing the volume of information, \nrepresenting it in a standard, systematic form, and drawing conclusions on the basis of the evidence) \nthen lead to progressively more general statements or conclusions. They may be informally \nrecorded, and can provide feedback to improve prediction and assist further knowledge acquisition \nby observation. They may subsequently result in records that can be permanently stored and made \ngenerally available by publication. Further evaluation (Fig. 1) is then needed to ensure that the \nindividual contributions are acceptable input to the shared record, and to keep track of their \nrelevance and significance as the science evolves. \nWithin geological survey agencies, internal controls ensure that they publish valid, consistent \nproducts, which maintain the reputation of their \u2018brand name\u2019. Editors and reviewers formally \nassess external papers. Later authors who quote, support or criticize previous publications implicitly \nevaluate them through their links and comments. Unevaluated and informal records may be held in \narchival collections to support the publications, but are normally accessed through a local expert \nwho can point out their shortcomings and limitations.  \nEvaluation of shared information must ultimately reflect human judgment, but it is at present a \nlaborious process that delays communication. As information technology develops, the systems will \noffer earlier availability. Publication takes on a new meaning as mechanisms develop for rapid \nexchange of smaller components of the information, and evaluation by current users is given greater \nweight. There may be scope for embedding evaluation criteria in algorithms that give flexible \nsupport to human judgment. Consideration of who requires what information for what purposes (the \npower relations mentioned in 2.1) would ideally lead to clear objectives defined within the business \nmodels. Explicit measures of success, linking objectives and results, might help editors, reviewers \nand managers to evaluate each contribution, and users to identify relevant information.  \nSurveying modifies, refines and extends what is already known. Its objectives could be defined in \nterms of prediction and generalization. For example, lithostratigraphic maps predict a wide range of \nrock properties in the context of their age and origin, reflecting the holistic approach. They \ntherefore provide predictions that can be generalized and extended to all other aspects of the \ngeology. The results of a survey might be regarded as a predictive representation \u2013 one that \ndescribes the real world in terms of predictions potentially verifiable by future (or temporarily \nwithheld) observations. Thus the surveyor does not know that a particular geological formation will \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  8\nunderlie the entire area shown in the appropriate color on a lithostratigraphic map, but thinks this \nlikely, implicitly predicting that further observations would confirm it. It is this test against the real \nworld that ultimately determines the soundness of the interpretation. \nOne possibility for assessing the value of results is to consider surveying as an example of \nreinforcement learning (a learning system that encourages progress towards defined objectives). \nSutton and Barto (1998) discuss reinforcement learning in the context of artificial intelligence, and \nRafols et al. (2005) argue that predictive representations generalize well. \u201cThe predictive \nrepresentations hypothesis holds that such representations are particularly good for generalization. \nA good representation is one that captures regularities of the environment in a form useful to the \nlearning agent; and in a reinforcement-learning task, something is \u2018useful\u2019 if it increases the agent\u2019s \nability to receive rewards. Thus, representations generalize well when the regularities they capture \nallow an agent to learn more efficiently how to increase its cumulative reward.\u201d  \nThis hypothesis applies to human behavior, including the acts of selection and generalization \ninvolved in the process of geological surveying. The surveyor might, for example, improve the \npredictions implied by the map by adjusting the delineation of unexposed boundaries as a result of \nlearning more about the behavior of the local rocks as the survey proceeds (capturing regularities \nuseful in improving prediction). The surveyor thus gains the rewards of satisfaction and kudos from \nproducing a better map and an enhanced reputation by explaining the more general geological \nconsequences. But the hypothesis also applies to software agents searching for relevant geological \ninformation, by reinforcing their learning with \u2018rewards\u2019 for successful searches (in the form of \nadjustments to a parameter in the algorithm). Similarly, users of a digital field support system might \nalign its reward system with their own objectives, with a view to helping them weigh the relevance \nof potential observations, and recognize and test more general concepts that extend their predictive \npower and usefulness. \nThe shared business models within a geological survey, and their similarity in different survey \nagencies, ensure that the products of the various projects, though differing in detail, contribute to a \ncoherent body of geological knowledge. This adds value to their products, partly because the shared \nunderstanding brings greater generalization. In other words, what is learned about individual topics \nand areas can be shared and applied more widely, with less need to restrict the frame of reference \nfor reconciliation. Standardization of concepts and their representation also adds value by wider \nsharing of processing tools, leading to more efficient handling and analysis of the information. The \nhuman and digital reward systems within the knowledge system must take account of the value that \nthese components contribute. The framework must be designed to accommodate not only existing \nmethods of evaluating information, but also partially automated and more complex procedures for \nevaluation as they develop. \n3.2 Abstraction and context \nThe results of geological investigations can be selectively formalized, recorded, stored and \ncommunicated as conventional information records, possibly augmented by a system for digital \naccess, as shown in Fig. 1. The greater part of shared representations (as opposed to tacit \nknowledge) is held and communicated in the conventional form of publications and archived \ncollections. They include information at all levels of detail from field notes and data records, \npublished summaries, and interpretations in the form of maps and accompanying reports, to less \ndetailed maps at smaller scales, regional guides and overviews in scientific papers and books. All \nthese records are the results of an abstraction process that reduces the volume of information while \nretaining salient points. There is feedback at all levels to maintain a coherent view, ensuring that \ndetailed and summary records correspond, and that new and existing records are consistent.  \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  9\nThe knowledge of each individual is inevitably specialized. But shared understanding, gained by \neducation and experience, including study of one another\u2019s work, ensures that the overall \nunderstanding of geoscientists provides a coherent view of their own specialist field and of all \naspects of their science at least at the level of a paradigm, where concepts are stable though not \nimmutable. Kuhn (1962) describes the paradigm as comprising universally recognized scientific \nachievements that for a time provide model problems and solutions to a community of practitioners. \n\u201cThe paradigm provides a map whose details are elucidated by mature scientific research, and since \nnature is too complex and varied to be explored at random, that map is as essential as observations \nand experiment to science\u2019s continuing development\u201d (page 108). In communicating with a specific \ncommunity, an author might assume familiarity with this background knowledge. \nBeyond this background understanding, the information required to understand a document is either \ncontained in it or in papers that it cites. The scientific paper, report or map is the typical unit in \nwhich geoscience information is recorded, referred to, and communicated. It may be concerned with \nrecording observations, interpretations or both in a wider context that explains their significance. Or \nit may place them in a new context that extends their significance or makes the findings available to \na new audience. As users differ in the extent and focus of their knowledge, objectives and outlook, \nthe same information may be presented separately for different audiences. The users must consider \nthe viewpoints of the originators when reconciling the information with their own viewpoints and \nneeds.  \nThe context of an individual document helps the user to understand it, following well-established \nconventions. For example, the map is a core product of most surveys. Geological maps are static \nand restricted to two dimensions, fixed scales, rigid sheet boundaries, inflexible visualizations and \nlimited information density. The map representation is separated physically from the text reasoning \nand explanation; it contains hidden ambiguities and deals inadequately with uncertainty. Context, \nhowever, helps to overcome these deficiencies and explain the meaning of information on the map \nface. The colored areas that show the distribution of stratigraphic categories are overprinted on a \ntopographic base map and geographic grid. The boundaries of each map are edge-matched with \nadjacent sheets. Map marginalia may include an explanatory key and stratigraphic table, cross-\nsections, generalized vertical sections and other diagrams and text, and a list of authors, \norganizations and dates that indicate the map\u2019s provenance. \nThe map may have a corresponding but separate narrative map explanation (text and illustrations) \nthat cites relevant papers, justifies the interpretation of the geology and places it in the context of its \ngeological and investigational history. The map and associated records provide information about \nthe geological objects that are displayed on the map face, placing them in their spatial and \nstratigraphic context and describing a range of properties including their composition, spatial form \nand relationships. Their origin and geological history may be described in the text explanation, \ncontaining spatial references that can be located on the map, and thence on the ground.  \nThe broader context of maps is given by summary information in the marginalia and by maps \ngeneralized to a smaller scale. Summary information for books and papers is provided by their \ntitles, tables of contents, indexes, and abstracts. International efforts have achieved a high level of \nstandardization in such areas as stratigraphic nomenclature (International Commission on \nStratigraphy, 2007), an important aspect of the geoscience framework expressed in an explicit form. \nThe formal structures of stratigraphic tables and map series have informal but widely understood \nextensions. Thus, the conventional framework has built-in aids to find, relate, understand and \nsummarize relevant information. \nInformation technology now augments these conventional systems with, for example, databases, \ngeographic information systems, and spatial models. It offers an alternative means of access \nthrough search engines with complex relevance criteria to find appropriate documents, and digital \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  10\ndelivery of papers, maps and images to examine, edit, manipulate and print at the desktop (Fig. 1). \nConventional records can be located through bibliographical indexes, and digital text can be \nsearched for relevant words or word combinations. References, indexes and databases also help to \nfind more detailed archived information supporting the map interpretation. This information \nincludes field notes, samples and specimens, photographs, and other related information such as \ngeophysical or geochemical studies and borehole records. Potentially, the Grid-based information \nsystem will share and extend this entry point. The ease of linking items in a digital environment \nsuggests that more powerful hypermedia models will connect the information from the various \ndocuments to overcome the distinction between map and context, and integrate all types of \ninformation at all levels of detail.  \n3.3 Information types \nIn the conventional framework just described, various types of information are combined in ways \nwe take for granted. But a different way of looking at the information may clarify another aspect \nimportant to its organization. Information is represented in various ways, each corresponding to a \nmemory type (Pinker, 1997, Loudon, 2000, pages A80-81) that is dealt with in a different area of \nthe human brain (Fig. 2, box 1). Thus, short-term memory (at the bottom of box 1) holds accurate \nbut brief memories of observed properties and comparisons, with results that can be recorded \n(promptly) as field notes or a database. Spatial memory deals with relative locations, sizes and \nshapes \u2013 information that can be captured as maps and sketches. Episodic memory is less reliable \nthan short-term memory, but lasts longer, and allows us to recreate in our minds sequences of past \nexperiences and events, extending to, say, a narrative account of historical geology and its \nunderlying reasoning. Procedural memory remembers motor and cognitive skills, which are \nessential for such tasks as driving a car or surveying in the field. Semantic memory is concerned \nwith background understanding of what one considers relevant, true and significant, such as aspects \nof an appropriate paradigm, which a computer system might support with a framework of \nontologies.  \nOperational procedures, controlled by feedback, move information through the boxes of Figure 2, \nwhich represent various stages of organizing, expressing and sharing information. Each box shows \nthe same five distinct information types, which are represented and manipulated differently, in \nparallel with patterns of human thought. The process of surveying initially extends the surveyor\u2019s \nbackground knowledge (box 1). Shareable information can subsequently be extracted (box 2), \ncommunicated to colleagues, and recorded as conventional records. In conventional publications \n(box 3), information types are either inextricably combined within a document (as in a book with \nmap illustrations), or entirely split apart in separate documents (such as a map and report). A digital, \npotentially Grid-based, system (box 4) with hypermedia links and mark-up languages will have \ngreater flexibility in relating information items, of any type, scale and extent, from any source. It \nmust work alongside conventional records, but will contain information derived directly from \nsurveying as well as that derived from conventional records. \nEach information type must be identifiable, for example, in digital files by their suffix (as in \nHTML) or from metadata, because each information type is manipulated differently. Thus the user \nof a database management system can select data by specifying ranges of values of relevant \nproperties, and can analyze them by statistical methods. The user of a geographic information \nsystem can overlay maps and images, identify and compare patterns, shapes and sizes of objects \nrepresented by color or ornament, pan around to see adjacent areas, zoom in or out for detail or \noverview \u2013 extended in spatial models by the ability to apply three-dimensional geometrical \ntransformations, and to select a volume of interest and the most informative visualization. Text can \nbe searched in episodic memory, with hypertext links that enable the user to follow threads of \nthought through the main story, and weave them together in the mind as a coherent narrative. Actual \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  11\ndemonstration, video clips, or illustrated manuals, taking the user step by step through procedures in \nthe real world with appropriate commentary, can help in the development of procedural skills. \nTraining, textbooks, education and experience develop the semantic memory, which in broad terms \nis related to the shared paradigm and ontologies, and in detail is specific to the background \nknowledge of each user.  \n \n \nFigure 2: Information types. The boxes show stages through which information passes, \ndriven and controlled by operational and feedback processes. Each box refers to the same \nfive information types, each of which is represented and manipulated differently. \n \nThe ease of linking items of information in a Grid-based system means that information types can \nbe separated for processing purposes, and linked to provide information on various aspects of the \nsame object or the same theme. For example, the system might select items of different information \ntypes referring to the same object, and represent them in linked frames side by side on the screen, \nwhere users can manipulate each in the appropriate mode, and reuse them in any appropriate \ncontext. Thus, selection of an object on a map, such as a set of boreholes, could call up relevant \nmaterial held in databases, imagery, and narrative text (or vice versa). The human ability of \nweaving understanding from threads of thought involving different information types can thus be \nfully supported. As mentioned earlier in this paper, the geological content and forms of presentation \nvary for different users and applications, and the information records must be explicitly designed as \ncomponents that are re-usable in different applications. The framework must enable all information \ntypes to work together at all scales. \n3.4 Wider horizons \nThe scientific process strongly encourages a shared view of the world. Indeed, a primary purpose of \nscience is to relate a myriad of observations to a few scientific laws. Explanation is the means of \nbringing together the consequences of numerous concepts and results, while standards contribute to \na shared frame of reference in which ideas are more readily exchanged. Many geological processes \nof most concern to mankind involve interactions of the lithosphere with the atmosphere, \nhydrosphere and biosphere, and therefore refer to Earth systems as a whole. \nThe National Research Council (US) (1993) set out proposals on \u2018Solid-Earth Sciences and Society\u2019 \ndeveloped through wide consultation by 150 earth scientists over a five-year period. Their \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  12\ninfluential conclusions took the view that the study of the whole-earth system provides an essential \nresearch framework for addressing global problems, interweaving many branches of pure and \napplied earth sciences. The study of Earth systems science became a driving concept for some key \ninternational scientific programs, and major universities began the long process of revising their \ncurricula in the light of these proposals. There is therefore a move to study and teach geology as one \nspecialized aspect of Earth systems science: \u201cthe seed of a new and revolutionary unification of the \nscience of our planet, how it works, its past history and its likely future\u201d (Cornell University, 2007). \nThe next generation of users will have changed expectations of the role of surveys in Earth systems \nscience. Graduates trained in this holistic approach are now potential staff in geological surveys and \ncustomers for survey information. \nThe diversity of users of geological survey information and their disciplines is apparent from listing \njust a few application areas, such as: resource estimation; mineral and energy extraction; civil \nengineering construction; land-use planning; agriculture; nuclear waste disposal; carbon \nsequestration; evaluation of threats from coastal erosion, landslips, earthquake and volcanic activity, \nand flooding; explaining past and present climate change; and studying environmental influences on \nevolution and extinction of life forms. In the same way as geological survey agencies are moving \nfrom a map-based approach to one based on spatial models and a systems view, applications are \nundergoing parallel developments within the diverse organizations and disciplines that use their \noutput. Geological information must be considered in the context of a knowledge system with a \nunified design that matches the unification of the science. \nA group of thirty-four leading scientists from the life, earth and computing sciences contributed to \nthe report, \u2018Towards 2020 science\u2019 (Emmott, 2006). They concluded that computing would not \nmerely help scientists with their work. Rather, the concepts, tools and theorems of computer science \nwill become integrated into the fabric of science itself, providing an orderly, formal framework and \nexploratory apparatus for other sciences, thus helping to break down barriers between disciplines. \nThe geoscience paradigm does not exist in isolation but is part of the wider paradigm for the Earth \nand life sciences. This suggests that a coordinated strategy is desirable to develop shared standards, \nat least at appropriate levels of framework, metadata and ontology, throughout the fields of life and \nEarth sciences and beyond. The alternative, of a piecemeal approach, could allow the concrete to set \non needlessly diverse structures for individual disciplines. Geoscience participation is therefore \ntimely. The global ambitions of future information systems will require extensions to an explicit \nframework for geoscience information and the use of more comprehensive and widely shared \nontologies. \nFor some future external users of geological information, the geoscience paradigm (implied in \nconventional publication) may be unfamiliar or inappropriate. The framework should therefore \nprovide an explicit representation of the structure of the underlying concepts and links to \nontologies. Procedures of geological surveying must be reviewed in the context of multidisciplinary \ninvestigations, and develop interoperable models that enable workers in different disciplines to \nwork together to integrate their knowledge.  For example, the fixed-scale view of geological maps \nlimits interoperability by constraining their interpretation in scale-space (Carey, 1962, Hay et al., \n2002). The design of the framework should enable geologists to study processes, and record and \nshare interpretations, at all scales. Such issues may require a review of the role of stratigraphic \nclassifications in the wider context of Earth systems science. \nThe global study of Earth systems has tended to focus on the atmosphere and oceans rather than the \nsolid Earth, and on geophysics rather than geology. Examples (a search engine should readily locate \ncurrent web-sites) are: Earth System Modeling Framework, International Geosphere-Biosphere \nProgramme, NASA\u2019s Earth Science Roadmaps, Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental \nTerminology, Program for Integrated Earth System Modelling, Solid Earth and Environment Grid, \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  13\nEarth System Curator, Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system model, and the Electronic \nGeophysical Year. Geologists must build on existing initiatives in these fields. \n \n4 Towards a Grid-based system \n4.1 Objectives \nBy far the greater part of shared geoscience information, as described earlier, remains within long-\nestablished systems that developed before digital computers and networks played a significant role. \nThe future framework must work with and build on this legacy. The records of geological surveying \nresult from a human activity, and rely on the skills of the human brain. Mechanical tools, from pen, \npaper and printing press to geophysical instruments and computer systems, can assist but cannot \ndisplace the human element, which pervades the entire system. It follows that the mechanical \ncomponents of the system should work in harmony with human goals and thought processes, and \nthat the function of recorded information is to support and enhance the background knowledge of \nthe human user. \nThe conventional system has significant deficiencies. A surprisingly large part of most scientific \npapers is a reworking of earlier published material, recast to explain the author\u2019s viewpoint. The \nresult is high redundancy, that is, there is much repetition of the same information. The mechanics \nand economics of printing and publication result in rigid, self-contained representations and a slow-\nmoving and expensive system. The Web has accelerated parts of the process, but has largely \nretained the conventional information structure. \nA Grid-based system will subdivide geoscience information into smaller, re-usable elements, \nreducing redundancy. Rapid recording, editing and delivery methods can overcome delays. The \nease of linking re-usable items of any information type for different purposes makes it highly \nflexible. Computer techniques, such as database, GIS (geographic information systems), and \ndocument processing, provide appropriate techniques for manipulating tabular, spatial and narrative \ninformation types, while hypertext linking can relate different information types referring to the \nsame object. Object-oriented analysis provides a context in which individual things or entities of \ngeological interest can be represented in the computer as object instances, and classified in \nhierarchies of object classes, inheriting properties as appropriate. Computer processing can handle \nroutine procedures, such as selection, analysis, interpolation, simulation, and visualization of \ngeological processes, replacing obscure rules of thumb with explicit definitions and justifications. \nAll of these are seen as part of a system in harmony with human thought and conventional \nprocedures.  \nThe Grid can facilitate linkage of information from various sources and simplifies the users\u2019 view \nof the knowledge system by delegating decisions to middleware (software that connects between \nsystems). De Roure (2007) states that: \u201cOur vision is of a generically useable e-Research \ninfrastructure, comprised of easily deployed components whose utility transcends their immediate \napplication, providing a high degree of easy-to-use and seamless automation and in which there are \nflexible collaborations and computations on a global scale. The key to this is an infrastructure where \nall resources, including services, are adequately described in a form that is machine-processable, i.e. \nknowledge is explicit.\u201d \nThe user interface should not be restricted to the digital part of the knowledge system, but should \nimprove access by users to all parts of the knowledge system, including indexes (and direct access \nin some cases) to the all-important conventional representations and unrecorded expert knowledge. \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  14\nIdeally, providers of information services, including geological surveys, will ensure that diverse \nknowledge sources share a consistent framework, are visible to the same search engines, and are \naccessible through the same user gateways or Grid portals (such as GridSphere, 2007).  \nA systems framework within the context of a Grid-based system can offer a means of positioning \nand classifying items (thereby relating them to one another and to other work), defining them \nthrough ontologies, and finding them in distributed information stores by means of indexes. These \ndevelopments support a change in the business models of geological survey agencies. The essential \ntask remains that of maintaining information resources that provide a coherent and authoritative \naccount of the geology of an area. But the emphasis changes \u2013 away from the geological map \ntowards a solid Earth systems model; and away from publishing printed end products towards \nenabling users to select flexible services that respond to their specific needs. \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Grid-based information system (from Fig. 1), as explained in section 4.2.  \n \n4.2 Application services \nThe scenario illustrated in Fig. 1 suggests that access from a computer terminal can augment \nconventional procedures, and could be extended to a Grid-based system with an explicit framework. \nThis is shown in more detail in Fig. 3. Users or contributors of information define their \nrequirements from their basis of background tacit knowledge. An \u2018agent\u2019 (software acting on the \nuser\u2019s behalf to perform a particular task) might assist users to select the services they require by \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  15\ncommunicating with the application services in the Grid-based information system.  It should \nenable users (those most likely to know their own requirements) to obtain appropriate products from \nexisting services, or to find components to extend or build their own solutions.  \nA standard service-oriented architecture that is aligned with business processes is described in \nOMG (2007). The services might be represented as workflows, which bring together, like links in a \nchain, a sequence of computational components along with annotations that clarify the purpose and \nreasoning for the user\u2019s benefit. A formal workflow language, such as Kepler (2007), can model \nand describe the selection of information and control its flow through the procedures of computer \nanalysis. Thus, given a request to provide, say, a lithostratigraphic map, the agent might consult \nwith the user to determine the area, scale, detail and visualization technique required, assemble the \nappropriate information, and deliver it as a map representation to the printer selected by the user. \nThe resulting \u2018scientific workflows\u2019 (Lud\u00e4scher et al., 2006) can potentially be built into a flexible \narchive for sharing and re-use or modification for specific needs. \nThe workflow archive can be seen as a Grid resource. It is a means of informing potential users of \nproducts obtainable from the geoscience knowledge system. However, the Grid will link to all areas \nof general and specific knowledge, and the longer-term objective is to participate in a global system \nwhere survey information can be fully integrated in its wider context, thus contributing to, and \nbenefiting from, work in other fields. The geoscience system must therefore take into account the \nrequirements of potential users outside geology. Consider, for example, a civil engineer assessing \nfoundations for a building, or an epidemiologist studying the link between trace elements and \nregional variation in health patterns. Ideally, the search engines they consult, or the agents sent from \ntheir desktops to search the Grid, should discover any appropriate geoscience information, whether \nor not the enquirers are aware of its existence or relevance, and regardless of whether the form of its \nrepresentation is spatial (map), narrative (scientific paper), or tabular (database). Search engines \nwith this ability to examine all information types appear to be under development, but the primary \nsearch is likely to be in text form. Authors of general applications might therefore link the computer \ninstructions of a workflow to a narrative explanation (in free text) designed to make its relevance \nvisible to potential users and to standard search engines (Fig. 3). Establishing relevance by means of \na search engine is based on analysis of information content, and can lead the user\u2019s agent to the \nsurvey\u2019s application services, which require a more rigorous structure. \nThe agent that selects and edits a workflow is guided by interaction with the user on the one hand, \nand the explicit framework (Fig. 3) on the other. The role of the framework is to develop standards \nfor geologists to agree on the definitions and structure of their knowledge, and make that structure \nexplicit and machine-processable. Its role within the Grid-based information system is somewhat \nanalogous to that of the geoscience paradigm within a geologist\u2019s brain. Its three components, now \nconsidered in turn, are the solid Earth systems metamodel, the associated ontologies, and indexes. \n4.3 The solid Earth systems metamodel \nThe solid Earth systems metamodel is intended to represent a coherent overall structure outlining \nhow geoscientists relate, organize, store and locate their shared ideas. As described in section 5, \nactual computer implementations refer to specific aspects of geoscience and require a much more \ndetailed and formalized approach. The structure might be compared to the geographical map \nreferencing system of latitude, longitude and elevation that defines conventions for referencing \npoints in geographical space, enabling the user to indicate a route across a map by a sequence of \npoint coordinates, or to define an irregular area, or a volume in three-dimensional space. The \nmetamodel obviously refers to many more dimensions than a conventional map, including the \ncountless dimensions of state-space, as well as stratigraphic time, and scale-space. As with any \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  16\nother referencing system, the metamodel should provide a means of defining any valid point, but \ndoes not imply the existence of information at that point. \nThe solid Earth systems model refers to the three-dimensional disposition and configuration (where \nthings are and how they are arranged) of the present-day observable objects of the solid Earth, and \ntheir observed and interpreted properties, composition and relationships. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 \nas a set of object instances, referring to object classes with specific ontologies and classifications \nthat may or may not be part of a wider system of generic ontologies. The overall arrangement of the \nEarth components is depicted as a spatial configuration of the object instances, based on spatial \nrelationships and inferred time relationships. Geological processes, which can also be classified and \ndescribed and may involve a generic ontology, act on the configuration of objects. The objects, \nprocesses and relationships are shown in the inner box of Fig. 4. \n \n \n \nFigure 4: An explicit framework for the information system (from Fig. 3). The metamodel \ndescribes the contents of the solid Earth systems model, providing a means of referencing \nthem, and bringing the components into a shared framework, which relates them to \nappropriate ontologies, indexes and hypermedia sequences. \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  17\n The model also refers, however, to the events and historical changes throughout geological time, \nincluding the past properties and configurations of conceptual objects and the processes and events \nthat created and altered them. These historical changes are arranged in terms of absolute or relative \ntime scales and are seen as essential aspects of the interpretation. Conceptually, the inner (present-\nday) box has equivalents describing the historical configuration of objects and processes at every \nmoment in the geological time-scale. It is therefore shown as enclosed in a second (history) box, \nreferring in another dimension (not shown) to the entire sequence of configurations and the \nhistorical changes between them. To make matters more complicated, any of these aspects could be \nconsidered at any level of scale, detail or granularity. The present-day and history boxes are \ntherefore embedded in a third (granularity) box, in yet another dimension (not shown) representing \nscale-space (3.4), where finer or coarser granularity may indicate change in resolution (the shortest \ndistance apart of two points that can be discriminated on an image) or detail (as in changing from a \nnarrower to a broader term or category). \nOf course, the model in its totality has no concrete existence, for its size is vast beyond \nrepresentation, and its full detail is beyond investigation. For good practical reasons, even the broad \naims of a geological survey are limited to investigation of various facets and fragments of this \ngeneral model. Conceptually, geological time and space are continuous, and potentially their \nquantitative representation could be precisely located at any point. In reality, the actual \nrepresentation space is practically empty, with sparse information located at only a few loosely \ndefined points. However, the top level of this model, the metamodel, could be part of a conceptual \nframework for the knowledge system specifying its contents, their organization, and the \nrelationships among them. \nThis model could guide information searches, in which the user could select from the displayed \nparameters and ontologies. Indexes could relate that selection to relevant items in distributed \ninformation stores. Geological evidence and reasoning could be tracked through geographical \nspace, scale-space and geological time as a hypermedia sequence during survey investigations, thus \nlinking evidence and reasoning through this multidimensional structure. Users searching for \ninformation could likewise specify their areas of interest as multidimensional tracts within a defined \ndistance of a particular path through the framework. Their specification can be represented as a \nworkflow to retrieve appropriate information (Fig. 3). \nThe reference structure is a means of relating observations, interpretations and reasoning derived \nfrom various fragments and facets of incomplete knowledge of local aspects of the geology. The \nstructure should bring them into a shared context, and identify their relationships within this wider \nview. It should support interoperability, linking a framework specific to geology to more generic \nexternal ontologies. It should identify basic aspects, such as spatial, stratigraphic and lithologic \nproperties that can be widely shared, and encourage consistent description of them during \nabstraction, codification and reasoning (3.1). It should provide a hospitable and extensible setting \nfor bringing general concepts, such as scale-space and complex systems, into surveying. The \nframework must adapt as the science evolves, but the top levels should be relatively stable.  \nThe metamodel must obviously be developed in collaboration with other Earth systems modeling \ninitiatives (3.4), since many geological processes relate directly to the atmosphere and hydrosphere. \nIt differs from the metadata describing the framework for data from the oceans and atmosphere, as \nin, for example, the Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system model (GENIE, 2007), and related \nactivities. The solid Earth model places more emphasis (2.3) on a holistic, historical, and \ninterpretative view. It relies on subjective interpretation based on the tacit knowledge of its \noriginators and users, and therefore requires subjective reconciliation (2.2) to share fragments of \nknowledge gained from differing points of view. \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  18\nAn initial strategy for handling the complexity is to simplify by classification, defining discrete \ncategories that refer to specified zones in the multidimensional space of the metamodel. On the \nbasis of observations and background knowledge, surveyors in the field then assign object instances \nand relationships to these object classes or categories. Within the metamodel, object classes can be \nlocated within classification space, based on their property and state-space ontologies. The \nontologies are not restricted to this metamodel but may be maintained externally in a wider context. \n4.4 Ontologies \nIdeas from ontology have entered geological surveys, and will contribute to the design of future \ngeoscience knowledge systems \u2013 a design that must be directed by the needs, working practices, \nand input of geoscientists. The word \u2018ontology\u2019 refers in philosophy to the systematic study of \nexistence. Within a computer system, what \u2018exists\u2019 is what is represented. The representation, for \nsome specific purpose, of an abstract, simplified view of the world, is referred to as a \nconceptualization. In computer science, an ontology is seen as a specification of a conceptualization \n(Gruber, 1993). As a bridge linking human knowledge and computer representation, it provides a \ncontrolled vocabulary to identify the things of interest (entities or objects), the processes or events \nthat transform them, and their characteristics and relationships in a particular field of interest \n(knowledge domain).  \nAccording to Raskin (2006) \u201cOntologies are a form of controlled terminology that differ \nfundamentally from taxonomies, thesauri, and other controlled hierarchical or linear lists of domain \nterms commonly adopted by organizations. Ontologies enable child terms to inherit all the \nproperties of their parents, rather than being subcategories of their parents. This fundamental \nassumption enables knowledge to be re-used and supports scalable knowledge construction, as it is \nnot necessary to redefine higher-level concepts previously defined. Ontologies provide the \nmechanism for articulating how a child concept differs from its parent, using the ontology concepts \nthemselves. Furthermore, ontologies support multiple inheritance, so that compound concepts are \neasily generated.\u201d \n Ontologies can help to provide a consistent context for storing, discovering, selecting, retrieving, \nanalyzing and sharing information as it moves from conventional to more flexible computer \nrepresentations, providing a coherent framework for the bottom-up automation and extension of \npreexisting systems. Ideally, geological surveys would be committed to a shared ontology; in fact, \nas pointed out in 5.3, ontologies differ for historical and other reasons. Ontology mapping \n(Lud\u00e4scher et al., 2003) can help to automate the combination of data from several sources within \nand outside a survey to share information, integrate data and guide reconciliation where sources \ndiverge. \nProposals for the Semantic Grid and interoperable models will help related disciplines to work \ntogether. According to Alper et al. (2006): \u201cThe Semantic Grid is a recent initiative to \nsystematically expose semantically rich information associated with Grid resources to build more \nintelligent Grid services. The idea is to make structured semantic descriptions real and visible \u2026 \nwith an associated identity and behaviour. We can then define mechanisms for their creation and \nmanagement and protocols for their processing, exchange and customisation\u2026 The background \nknowledge and vocabulary of a domain can be captured in ontologies \u2013 machine processable \nmodels of concepts, their interrelationships and their constraints\u2026 Metadata labels Grid resources \nand entities with concepts\u2026 Rules and classification-based automatic inference mechanisms \ngenerate new metadata based on logical reasoning\u201d.  \nOntologies and workflows set in a suitable framework should promote re-usability of \nrepresentations of: objects, their characteristics (properties and composition) and relationships; \ngeological process models; and surveying procedures. The framework should encourage regional \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  19\nand global consistency through evolving standards. There are huge potential benefits in sharing \nconcepts, models and computer representations among all appropriate disciplines as interoperable \nelements, that is, items defined and recorded in such a way that they can be interpreted and \nprocessed together. However, items of information can be interoperable between disciplines only if \nthe larger context of viewpoints, frames of reference and methods of investigation can be \nreconciled, and even within a single discipline, problems may arise. \nBased on philosophical analysis, Brodaric and Gahegan (2006, p.2) identify \u201cseveral challenges to \ngeoscientific information interoperability, present an approach that addresses some of the \nchallenges, and\u2026 demonstrate the approach.\u201d They propose technical solutions. They point to some \npossibly unique characteristics of geoscientific knowledge, although many apparent differences in \nspecialized topics may simply reflect their divergent evolution. In the same volume, Richard (2006) \nproposes models for Earth material, geologic units and geologic structure as a starting point for a \nframework for developing interoperable systems. He places these in a setting of more general, top-\nlevel concepts (SUO WG, 2003).  \nThe global aspect implies that ontologies must be expressed in terms that conform to Grid standards \nand can be widely understood. This implies that an explicit shared framework for geoscience \nknowledge must be linked as far as possible to a more general framework of ontologies (Fig. 4).  \n4.5 Generic ontologies and indexes \nThe multiplicity of viewpoints in local studies of geoscience might be reflected in the infrastructure \nby a variety of large and small ontologies, specific to the problem at hand. The ontologies provide \nan overview of the detailed information content. Working connections among them can be \nestablished through linkages, in a system that encourages their rationalization, and reconciliation for \nspecific purposes (with inevitable loss of some information), in response to real user needs \n(Lud\u00e4scher et al., 2003).  \nEach instance of an object, relationship, configuration, process or event, refers to concepts that \nidentify appropriate ontologies for its description (Fig. 4). The ontologies discriminate and classify \nthe concepts; and the solid Earth systems model places the ontologies within the context in which \nthey are viewed in geological survey. The extent of shared ontologies and compatible frameworks \nwill determine the degree of interoperability in the information system. \nThe list of generic ontologies in Fig. 4 requires further explanation. The individual external \nontologies should ideally be part of a comprehensive hierarchy of ontologies (ontology space) \nwhere the relationships between them were apparent at a higher level in the hierarchy (SUO WG, \n2003). The solid Earth systems model is part of a broader framework and is related to, and interacts \nwith, other models referring, for example, to the hydrosphere or atmosphere. Thus, geological \ndefinitions that refer to physical, chemical and biological terms and processes might be defined \nexternally, within their primary field. Many involve processes that can be described in terms of the \ngeneral processes of physics, chemistry or biology. Components of the models are likely to be re-\nusable in other subjects, and again could be identified and shared through an external ontology. \nGeological classifications are likely to refer to a range of values of various properties within which \nan object class is expected to lie. It therefore refers to an area of state-space, a general concept \nrepresenting the set of all possible states (defined by combinations of values of properties). State-\nspace can be thought of in geometrical terms as a multi-dimensional space where each dimension \nrepresents a property, and each point represents a specific state.  \nSpace relationships and time relationships may place items on a numerical scale. But in referring to \nevents in the stratigraphical past where geographical coordinates are lacking, knowledge of space \nrelationships may be limited to such terms as: adjoining, truncating, overlapping, above, below, in \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  20\nfront of, behind, between, and beyond. The relationships might be illustrated on a sketch with no \nfixed direction or scale, but could not be correctly positioned on a map with a geographical grid. \nTime relationships, particularly in detailed survey, may not be able to place events on a \ngeochronological scale and be limited to concepts such as before, after, and during, probably \ndeduced from spatial relationships. Mark-up languages supported by databases are a possible tool \nfor recording and reasoning with the relationships, and are supported by software for searching \ndocuments, to identify references to time and space relationships in the text (Boguraev and Ando, \n2005) and build appropriate indexes.  \nAn appropriate mathematical framework for representing such relationships is a directed graph, as \nused in critical path analysis, which can position events according to either time relationships or \nabsolute numerical values. Stratigraphic and space indexes derived from information in marked-up \ntext and maps could be valuable geological tools. The need for viewing and recording geological \nprocesses and objects within scale-space, and the desirability of considering scale in linking them to \nmodels from other disciplines, was mentioned in section 3.4. \nThe scientific workflows described in section 4.2 can provide digital access (Fig. 3) to meet the \nuser\u2019s processing requirements, by retrieving and processing re-usable components from \ninformation stores, for appropriate presentation and visualization at the user\u2019s desktop or to \nincorporate in other models (Lud\u00e4scher et al., 2006). Survey experts might prepare standard, off-\nthe-shelf workflows, for example to print geological maps, which ensure that the results are a valid \ninterpretation of the data. Surveyors can extend the options by recording data in three dimensions \nand reworking earlier maps with the help of remote imagery. The end user could thus select, \ncombine and adjust re-usable workflows to derive various products from the same information base, \ncustomized for the appropriate class of user requirement. A longer-term objective might be for the \nuser\u2019s agent to create workflows to meet specific requirements as defined and requisitioned by the \ncustomer.  \nScientific workflows have the important potential to record the course of the surveying process \n(Alvarado et al., 2005) as it proceeds through the framework, tracking the process of observation, \nreasoning, and interpretation. This process is thus made explicit, with full attribution and \nprovenance to identify the originator\u2019s specific viewpoint, linking the findings to other overlapping \nwork, and embedding the activity of surveying within its wider geoscience context. The hypertext \nsequences of scientific workflows have potential value both for setting out procedures for providing \nusers with information from shared information stores, and for recording the procedures of \ngeological surveying to relate observations to interpretations. They are a convenient means of \nlinking sequences of computer operations, providing explanatory commentary (which can make \nthem visible to standard search engines) and interacting with the user where choices have to be \nmade.  \nLibraries of re-usable workflow components need not be limited to geological applications. The \nthreads of reasoning that are a means of recording the reasoning that underlies interpretations and \nexplanations are also hypertext sequences. Their relevance could well extend beyond geological \ninformation, and they might therefore be viewed as a generic tool. \n4.6 Constraints on object behavior \nBecause the Grid aims to hide complexity from the user, workflows should be able to connect to \nrules and properties constraining the behavior of object classes and instances, preferably expressed \nin Grid-wide standard form. Workflows might take the form of metadata attached to the individual \nitem, or might be implied by class characteristics defined in the ontology. They should enable the \nmiddleware to link objects to appropriate procedures (Fig. 5) for tasks such as filtering, \ntransforming, generalizing, analyzing, interpolating, visualizing geological objects, and simulating  \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  21\n  \nFigure 5: Applying constraints on object behavior. The retrieved information (Fig. 3) and \nthe analytical procedures are obtained from internal information stores or external sources. \nThe metadata define the acceptable modes of analysis of the information, enabling the \nmiddleware to match it to appropriate models or processes. \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  22\ngeological processes. Metadata should be available to indicate the behavior of the objects and their \nappropriateness for likely modes of analysis, represented in general terms that support concept and \nmodel interoperability across disciplines (Fig. 5). \nThe potentially wide range of users for the geoscience component of the knowledge system implies \nthat it must develop in line with future, general-purpose, knowledge management systems. In the \ncontext of the Semantic Grid, the sources of information should be adequately described by \nmetadata in a form that enables middleware to match the information to appropriate and valid \nprocedures. For example, an agent searching for the deepest point reached by a formation in a \nparticular basin might locate a set of well data. The metadata might indicate that for commercial \nreasons the wells were deliberately drilled on anticlines, and the middleware might reasonably \nconclude that an appropriate approach might be to simulate possible fold patterns based on \nstatistical data for similar environments, fitted to the data but weighted for the known bias. \nThe middleware (Fig. 5) requires access to metadata clarifying the behavior of each object, and the \nresulting constraints on the appropriate models for its analysis. The metadata might be available at \nthe level of the ontology in which the object is defined, or inherited from a higher-level object, or \nassociated directly with an object class or instance. There is of course a hierarchical structure of \nobjects, so that for example a configuration describing individual objects and their relationships \nmight itself be regarded as a higher-level object. The provenance of the objects, including the \nobjectives and investigational design of the project in which they were described (Fig. 1), is also \nrelevant to their analysis. The corresponding metadata should be linked with the objects through the \nproject workflow. \nThe object metadata, the models and the processes must be categorized and described to specify \nhow the object behaves when a particular category of process model is applied. Thus they require \nontologies, which, like the middleware, will inevitably have a major local component but should \nevolve to match general Grid standards, and should be described as far as possible in general \nmultidisciplinary terms. This area is at an early stage of development, and in the short term, \ndecisions about behaviors and constraints must continue to rely on the intervention of human \nexperts. \n \n5 Steps to implementation \n5.1 Digital cartography \nTraditionally geological maps have been the main means of communicating the results of \ngeological survey. Geological map series produced by a particular geological survey conform to its \nstandard symbology, with relevant items explained in the map keys. The key, as well as providing a \ndescription of the meaning of individual symbols, also commonly provides additional information, \nsuch as a stratigraphic hierarchy for lithostratigraphic symbols. These keys represent early \ngeoscience ontologies. However, there are problems with using geological maps as the primary \nmeans of communicating geoscience information. Although geological maps from a single series \naim at a standard symbology, in practice it can vary in detail from map to map, in part because \ncompletion of a map series can take many years. Each map therefore has its own ontology (Brodaric \nand Hastings, 2002).  \nA bigger communication problem arises between map series, particularly if produced by different \ngeological surveys. Although geological maps follow similar conventions, there can be significant \ndifferences between the underlying ontologies, a fact that may be disguised by the apparent \nsimilarity of the symbolic conventions. This leads to a key property of geological maps \u2013 much  \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  23\ninformation on them is implicit rather than explicit. It is assumed that users of geological maps have \nin common a geological training and background that enables them to interpret the implicit \ninformation, but even with such a shared background there is much room for misinterpretation and \nmisunderstanding. \nGeological maps were digitized using computer-aided design (CAD) software from the 1980\u2019s \nonwards. The motivation was to speed up the production process for paper maps. The software was \nused within cartographic departments with little or no involvement of geologists, for whom the \ntraditional geological map production workflow remained unchanged. The maps continued to use \nthe symbology developed for the paper maps, albeit now realized through color tables and symbol \nlibraries. The digital files produced by CAD software were not seen as an end product, but merely a \nstep towards the production of the traditional paper map \u2013 and the output of such systems was \nlargely judged by how closely they could mimic a map produced using traditional methods. \nHowever, these developments coincided with a requirement to derive various thematic maps from \nthe standard geological map, and the digital files produced by CAD software could speed their \nproduction through the selection and merging of map features. \n5.2 Spatial information systems \nIt soon became clear that selection of map components using CAD software had significant \nlimitations, because it was dependent on map symbology. The ability to replace this limited \ncapability with selection on the basis of geoscientific attributes was one of the main early drivers for \nthe implementation of geological maps within geographical information systems (GIS). In carrying \nout such an implementation a decision had to be made as to whether the geological map should be \nmodeled as a map, or as that subset of geological reality portrayed on the map. The principal \ndistinction between the two approaches is that in the first case only those properties reflected in map \nsymbology are implemented whereas in the second approach all available properties of the mapped \nfeatures are implemented.  \nThe first approach, apart from replacing CAD symbology with scientific terms familiar to \ngeologists, also adds information by allowing the use of geoscientifically structured ontologies such \nas a rock classification system or stratigraphic lexicon. These allow more complex queries such as \n\u2018all igneous rocks\u2019 or \u2018pre-Permian rocks\u2019 to be made. Map symbols that reflect multiple properties, \nsuch as a line style representing an inferred normal fault, can also be broken down into their \ncomponent properties, in this case \u2018fault type\u2019 and \u2018positional confidence\u2019.  \nThe second approach, implemented in GIS, shares these benefits but in addition allows the encoding \nof information implicit on the map, thus making it explicit. This approach can be seen as the first \nstep to the creation of a more general geoscientific data model, independent of any particular \nmedium for communication. \nThe implementation of geological maps within GIS systems, with an underpinning geoscientific \ndata model, led to the creation of spatial databases in which map data could be integrated with point \ninformation, such as boreholes and samples, held in relational database tables. This encouraged the \ndevelopment of more comprehensive corporate data models embracing a wider range of \ngeoscientific information. Such integration was further enabled with software developments that \nfacilitate the handling of spatial data within relational databases, rather than in vendor-specific \nformats within GIS systems. These developments were used to underpin an increasing move to \ndelivering geoscientific information in digital form, often tailored to the requirements of particular \ncustomers or end-users. \nIncreasingly geological surveys are creating computer representations (spatial models) that extend \nmappable data into three dimensions (Smith, 2005). These models may depict the same geological \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  24\nobjects as those shown on geological maps, extending them below the mapped surface, or they may \nrepresent some other geological property such as water in an aquifer. Because both the spatial \nmodels and maps portray the same real-world objects they can be described using the same data \nschema.  \n5.3 Data exchange \nProviders of geoscientific information have developed, independently, their own data models. \nAlthough these data models all describe the same real world objects, such as faults or boreholes, the \nmeans of description differ. This is partly due to a different emphasis in the business models of \ndifferent organizations. For example, organizations concerned with groundwater contamination \nmight carry out a wide range of chemical tests on samples. It is also due to the fact that any \nmapping from the real world to a data model is necessarily arbitrary, because there is no single \n\u2018correct\u2019 answer. For example, rock fabric can be described either as an independent structure or as \na property of a rock body.  \nThe resulting differences in data models have meant that it has not been possible for customers to \neasily integrate geoscientific data provided by different suppliers. This problem was particularly \nacute in those countries with both federal and state or provincial geological surveys such as \nAustralia, Canada, Germany, and the United States. In North America this led to the development \nof the North American Geologic Map Data Model (North American Geologic Map Data Model \nSteering Committee, 2004). The need for data exchange extended internationally, and was \nprompted by increasing customer demand for more standardized geoscientific information that \nwould allow the development of standard software to process it. This led to an international web-\nbased collaboration (CGI, 2007b) under the auspices of the International Union of Geological \nSciences (IUGS) Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information \n(CGI, 2007a) \u201cto develop a conceptual model of geoscientific information drawing on existing data \nmodels\u201d and to \u201cimplement an XML\/GML encoding of the model subset\u201d for data exchange. The \nscope of the model was set in the first instance as being geological maps and boreholes \u2013 the two \ntypes of data generally most in demand from geological surveys \u2013 but the aim is to extend this \nsubsequently to more types of geoscientific information. The common data model is being \ndeveloped in Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the current version can be seen at the CGI \nData Model \u2018Twiki\u2019 web site (CGI, 2007c). \nIt is not envisaged that geoscience data providers should transform their internal data models to the \nagreed common data model. The cost of such a transformation, which would include rewriting an \norganization\u2019s software applications, would be prohibitive, but more significantly the common data \nmodel would be unlikely to meet each organization\u2019s business requirements. The objective is to \nenable data models of individual data providers to be mapped to the common data model for \ndelivery. There is likely to be some loss of information in this process, but, over time, data \nproviders can develop their own data models to conform more closely to the international model.  \nTo exchange data derived from the common data model between organizations the model needs to \nbe mapped onto a mark-up language. Mark-up languages retain the structure of the data model and \nare both machine readable and human readable. Upon receipt the marked-up file can be transformed \nback into a database implementation reflecting the common data model. The mark-up language \nbeing developed for geoscience is GeoSciML (Sen, M. & Duffy, T., 2005) and is based on GML \n(Geography Markup Language). GML is an XML (Extensible Markup Language) grammar defined \nby the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to express geographical features. One of the \ncharacteristics of GML is that it separates geometry from the description of features, which means \nthat GeoSciML can be used equally well to transfer data from maps or from three-dimensional \nspatial models. \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  25\nThe simplest means of data exchange is to transfer the GeoSciML file directly. However, because \nGeoSciML is based on GML, it can also be delivered using the developing OGC Web Mapping \nService (WMS) and Web Feature Service (WFS) standards. These services allow the data to be \nviewed and interrogated within a web browser, and importantly, also to be integrated with data from \nother sources. A test-bed is being developed to test the delivery and exchange of GeoSciML using \nWMS and WFS. \n5.4 Ontology development \nGeoSciML will enable interoperability at a technical level, so that different data providers will be \ndescribing the same geoscientific objects using the same properties, but there will not necessarily be \nscientific interoperability. For example, although the data model may specify \u2018Geologic Age\u2019 as a \nproperty of a \u2018Geologic Unit\u2019, if different stratigraphic classification systems are used by different \ndata providers to define \u2018Geologic Age\u2019 then the resulting data will be incompatible even though it \nwill still conform to GeoSciML. To achieve scientific interoperability the terms used to describe a \nparticular property need to be the same, and this requires agreement on geoscientific vocabularies.  \nAchieving this will be a major task due to the large volumes of legacy data described using data \nprovider\u2019s own vocabularies. \nThe most realistic approach in the medium term is to compile and structure the concepts in existing \nvocabularies and use this structuring as the basis for developing a mapping between concepts in \ndifferent vocabularies (Brodaric and Gahegan, 2006; Lud\u00e4scher et al. 2006). This mapping will not \nalways be one-to-one, because different organizations may define broadly similar concepts in \nslightly different ways, but it will define the extent of overlap of concepts. There is more likelihood \nof concept mismatch, and more scope for misunderstanding, where concepts are defined in different \nlanguages. This process of concept mapping will provide a basis for multilingual systems that go \nbeyond translation to a genuine exchange of meaning. Identifying areas of partial concept overlap is \nessential to achieving genuine interoperability between geoscience organizations. It will be even \nmore important when using geoscience data in a future Grid environment in conjunction with other \ndiscipline domains between which there is likely to be a lower degree of concept overlap. \n5.5 Drafting a roadmap \nConsiderable progress has been made in bringing geological maps (as a core product of geological \nsurveys), and many associated documents and databases, into a systematic digital representation \nbased on international standards. However, survey agencies are faced with larger tasks in adapting \nto changes in the cyberinfrastructure. These changes will affect their business plans and surveying \nmethods, as well as the issues involving the systems framework discussed in this paper. Individual \nsurveys will, of course, progress at different rates, and their priorities will differ. It may be desirable \nin each case to plan ahead for these changes, determining local priorities, the sequence in which \ntasks should be addressed, and the resources required. With some of these issues, the geological \nprofession as a whole must be involved. As a possible starting point, Table 1 sets out some \nsuggestions about aspects of the development related to the systems framework. Some are already \nwell developed; others are potential extensions to the system. The various aspects can develop in \nparallel, providing increasingly detailed and well-described items of information. Ontologies should \nlead to greater standardization of the descriptions, and improve the connection of information of all \ntypes (data, map, model, and text) at all levels of detail, for the user to select, assemble, and edit as \nhypermedia information for analysis, presentation, visualization or incorporation in an external \nmodel. Future standards will increasingly be multidisciplinary. We hope that the list will provoke \ndiscussion on a road map for planning future developments in geological surveying, and help to \nidentify gaps where more work is required. \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  26\n \nAspect Actions Outcome Benefits \nDatabase Record quantitative and \nqualitative data \nDigital datasets Reuse dataset for any applicable analysis \n Describe content in metadata, \npreferably in standard form \nSelf-describing \ndata \nUsable by others, or at a later date \n Data modeling and standard \n(relational) structuring of data \nand metadata \nCoherent database \nstructure \nWidely usable interconnected database, with \nuser selection on basis of quantified and \nqualitative values \nDigital maps Scan maps Digital \nrepresentation \nOverlay, pan, zoom;

The Internet is seen as evolving to \u2018the Grid\u2019, supplying digital \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  28\ninformation (representing fragments of global knowledge) as a commodity, just as the electricity \ngrid delivers power. Concepts, tools and theorems of computer science are being woven into the \nfabric of science, providing it with an orderly, formal framework and exploratory apparatus that \nhelps to break down barriers between disciplines. Many studies of geological events that most \nconcern mankind involve interactions among the lithosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and \natmosphere, and can be unified within Earth systems science \u2013 the science of our planet, how it \nworks, its history and its likely future. \nIn response to this changing environment, geological surveys are adapting their legacy of \nknowledge, including the geological maps and explanations that are its core expression worldwide. \nMany have recognized the value and technical feasibility of: generating sets of thematic maps by \nrecombining map elements within a GIS-based cartographic system; supplementing lines on a map \nwith three-dimensional digital representations; visualizing map data alongside other geospatial \ninformation; describing paths of linked activities with scientific workflows and thereby re-using \nitems in various contexts; developing internationally standardized schemas; and linking diverse \nstudies through ontologies (GEON, 2007). Object-oriented analysis has provided a structure for \nrepresenting the digital information as discrete items that can be re-used in various contexts for a \nrange of defined purposes. Some geological organizations are already weaving these strands \ntogether (Natural Resources Canada, 2007), edging away from publication of maps and memoirs as \ntheir mainstream product and moving towards contributing to a whole-earth knowledge system that \nrelates processes and products, and enables users to obtain flexible responses to specific needs. \nThe change of approach does not alter the primary objective of a geological survey agency \u2013 to \ndevelop, record, maintain and communicate a reliable, authoritative, coherent, and up-to-date \naccount of the geology of a region. The objective is achieved by integration of knowledge from \nrelevant available sources, systematic field observation and measurement of salient geoscience \nproperties, and their analysis and interpretation in the context of the rock types they characterize. \nThe emphasis is generally on understanding the nature, distribution, history and configuration of the \nrock types, required as background information for a wide range of commercial, regulatory, and \nresearch activities, such as mitigation of natural hazards or assessment of natural resources. \nHowever, global sharing of survey information across geographic, institutional and disciplinary \nboundaries involves much more than digitizing existing material. The transition calls for revision of \nthe systems framework, in step with changing business models and reconsideration of the concepts \nand methods of surveying, to meet the expectations of a wider range of users and requirements. The \nframework must support and utilize reasoning networks and interpretations that take into account \nhistorical processes and object configurations. The originators and users of information must \nreconcile their views of the underlying concepts, classifications, procedures and understanding of \nprocesses, so that these may work together as interoperable components of a more inclusive system. \nInterconnected, re-usable items of various hypermedia information types can be assembled to meet \na particular requirement, and processed side-by-side by the appropriate tools to weave a composite \nunderstanding in the tacit knowledge of the user\u2019s brain.  \nThe system as a whole must build on what already exists, but it should enable geoscientists to \naugment their conventional representations and unexpressed knowledge with new approaches to \nsurveying geology and sharing the results. It should take into account the facts that not all \ngeologists have the same background understanding and not all agree on every interpretation. \nMechanisms for consultation with experts are essential for communicating unexpressed knowledge, \nand must remain part of the knowledge system. Relevant data on the worldview, business model, \nproject objectives, and investigational design and procedures describe the provenance and context \nin which information was collected, and may be essential to understand it.  These data should be \nrecorded and made available as metadata to assist in defining valid applications and reconciling \nLoudon, T.V., and Laxton, J.L., 2007, Steps toward Grid-based geological survey  29\ninformation from various sources. Constraints on object behavior could also be recorded as \nmetadata to guide their analysis. Obscure rules of thumb that handle routine procedures, such as \nselection, visualization, analysis, interpolation, and simulation of geological processes, could be \nreplaced with explicit definitions and justifications. Evaluation pervades the observation and \nrecording of information, and artificial intelligence techniques can augment the essential human \njudgment. \nThe ability of geoscientists to understand one another depends on overlapping knowledge of parts \nof a general paradigm, of which the solid Earth systems model is a part. An explicit framework for a \nGrid-based system could therefore include the metamodel, or top-level description, of the solid \nEarth systems model. It could provide a shared multidimensional framework to which individual \nitems of information can be referenced, a higher dimensional equivalent of referencing a point on a \nmap with geographical coordinates. The framework could thus provide a means of relating objects \nwhose similarity can be defined by parameters of geological significance, not just spatially but also \nin terms of stratigraphic age, configuration, environment and processes of formation, properties, and \nscale or granularity. The dimensions relate to ontologies, many of which are seen to be of more \ngeneral interest, and should therefore be standardized over a wider field than geoscience. Indexes \ncan relate items in distributed information stores with points or zones in the framework. \nThe metamodel and associated ontologies provide a means of describing a route through the model, \nsuch as that followed by the sequence of hypermedia operations in a scientific workflow. The route \nmight refer to the path followed by a project investigation, or by a thread of reasoning, possibly \nessential for shared understanding. It may refer to the application of a processing procedure, or to \nretrieving information from topics of interest. The framework of metamodel, ontologies and indexes \ncould be used by application services to provide an informative user interface, in which the user \nindicates topics of interest, and the system provides a graphical display of the relevant available \ninformation, enabling users to progressively refine their requirements as they learn more. Such a \nframework might also guide reworking of legacy information for added value and benefit, as \ncomputer support and interdisciplinary cooperation lead to a deeper understanding of the solid Earth \nas a whole. \nSurveys will continue to extend their proven, open standards, within a model-driven service-\noriented architecture, aiming for interoperability and adoption of generic methods for describing \nobject behaviors and constraints, and building compatibility with related disciplines and new \nmethods. Consideration of an explicit systems framework for geoscience is timely, initially \nimplemented as local experiments, potentially in a standard form to aid global communication. \nAcknowledgments \nThe authors wish to thank Bill Hatton, Emrys Phillips, and other colleagues for their friendly and \nhelpful support, and Boyan Brodaric and Steve Richard for their invaluable and generous assistance \nin improving this paper.
