The income of nonworking older men was substantially below that of men\nstill working. We find no evidence that retirement rates increased at the state-pen-\nsionable age\u2014unsurprisingly, since pension payments provided less than a poverty-\nline income. Less demanding or part-time work was unavailable. Hence we conclude\nthat the decision of older manual workers to leave the labor market was determined\nprimarily by the absence of appropriate employment opportunities, rather than the\npresence of substantial assets or nonlabor income.\nThis article examines the reasons why older men left the London laborforce in the early 1930s. In Britain, as in other industrialized countries,\nthe interwar period seems to have marked a change of employment regime\nfor older men. Before the First World War, participation rates for men aged\n65 and over were high; between 60 and 70 percent in Britain, France, and the\nUnited States, and over 50 percent in Germany, according to census data.\nThese rates appear to have been constant over the period from 1900 to 1920\nin France, and to have fallen only slightly in Britain, Germany, and the\nUnited States. But the 1920s and 1930s saw an uninterrupted decline.1\nMere identification of the interwar period as a turning point in the labor-force\nparticipation of older men does not, however, advance our understanding of the\nreasons for this change. In Britain the interwar years witnessed massive struc-\ntural change, high levels of unemployment, considerable industrial reorganiza-\nThe Journal of Economic History, Vol. 59, No. 4 (Dec. 1999). \u00a9 The Economic History\nAssociation.

Any or all of these factors may have affected the propen-\nsity of older men to participate in the labor force. The retirement decision may\nbe thought of as a supply-side choice made by the individual worker, one which\ndepends on the relative costs and benefits of continued economic activity com-\npared with permanent withdrawal from the labor force. The level of labor de-\nmand will obviously affect this choice, by determining the returns to economic\nactivity and the costs of job search for those not employed. In order to unpick\nthe simultaneous impact of demand-side and supply-side effects on the labor-\nforce participation of older men we would wish, ideally, to trace the labor-\nmarket history of a representative sample of workers over time. Unfortunately\nno representative longitudinal labor-market data exist for the United Kingdom\nfor any period before the 1980s. Nor is there any immediate prospect of using\ncensus data retrospectively to construct longitudinal employment data; the\nmanuscript schedules of the British census are entirely closed to researchers for\n100 years, and there is no public-use sample. Previous attempts to examine the\nrelationship between age and employment have had to rely on aggregate data\nfrom the decennial censuses and the unemployment insurance system. Most of\nthe underlying data in these sources are presented as crude single-variable tabu-\nlations. Hence it is not possible to evaluate the marginal impact of different\nfactors on the propensity to withdraw from the workforce at a particular age.2 In\nthis article we attempt to evaluate the relative impact of demand-side and\nsupply-side factors on the propensity of older men to withdraw from the work-\nforce by making use of a newly computerized survey of 26,915 metropolitan\nhouseholds that was carried out between 1929 and 1932 for the New Survey of\nLondon Life and Labour (hereafter NSLLL).\nCross-sectional surveys are far from ideal instruments with which to examine\nthis process. However, the wealth of detail in the NSLLL, including individual\ninformation on age, employment status, occupation, earnings, nonlabor income,\nand household structure, enables us to formulate and test a number of hypotheses\nabout demand- and supply-side influences on labor-force withdrawal. The impact\nof demand- and supply-side forces on the economic activity of older men is our\nprimary concern here. Before undertaking this analysis, we shall present some\ninformation on the household survey from which we derive most of our empirical\nevidence, and assess the reliability and representativeness of that data.\nTHE NEW SURVEY OF LONDON LIFE AND LABOUR\nThe NSLLL was the largest and most comprehensive social survey under-\ntaken in Britain before the Second World War.3 It was designed to follow up\n1\n For example Thomas, \"Labour Market\"; and Johnson, \"Employment.\"\n3\n Llewellyn-Smith, New Survey.\nLondon Labor Market 951\nthe pioneering investigations undertaken by Charles Booth in the late 1880s.\nThe primary purpose of both surveys was to estimate the extent and causes\nof poverty in London.4 The NSLLL involved a detailed house-to-house en-\nquiry undertaken between 1929 and 1932, during which information was\ncollected on 28,100 working-class households containing 98,400 individu-\nals, out of which data concerning 26,915 households and 94,137 individuals\nhave survived.5 This was about 2 percent of the working-class population of\n38 London boroughs. Considerable care was taken to obtain the fullest possi-\nble responses from each household about demographic structure, occupation,\nearnings, nonlabor income, and birthplace of each member.\nVery little of the NSLLL household data were analyzed by the original\nteam.6 All the social surveys of the time shared a low ratio of analysis to data\nsince, in a world without computers, tabulation capacity was limited. The\nNSLLL is unique, however, in that it is the only British survey before the\nSecond World War that survives (almost) in its entirety: the original house-\nhold survey cards are held in the British Library of Political and Economic\nScience\u2014the London School of Economics library\u2014and they have now\nbeen fully computerized.7\nThe selection bias of the NSLLL sample must be noted. Only working-\nclass households, as defined by the occupation of the main wage earner,\nwere included. Households within the sampling frame in which the main\nearner was not deemed working-class were ignored.8 In the NSLLL, the\nhousehold was defined effectively as all persons living at one address. Per-\nsons defined as \"spinster\" or \"widow\" were included; and there was only\none \"head,\" even in a three-generation family.9 The original survey included\nlodgers as members of the household if they received board. We have ex-\ncluded them\u2014that is, we count lodgers as separate households\u2014on the\n4\n Booth, Life and Labour. The development of the social survey is discussed in Bulmer, Bales, and\nSklar, Social Survey.\n5\n The cards for the outer London boroughs of Walthamstow and Tottenham, although used for the\npublished volumes, have been lost.\n6\n The sample data were referred to in only two of the nine published volumes, and then only in\naggregated form.\n7\n The entire content of each card has been computerized and additional coding of occupations,\nbirthplaces, and location of employer has been undertakea Full details of the project, including the\nquality of the sample, are given in Baines, Computerisation. The NSLLL data set has been deposited\nat the ESRC Data Archive, University of Essex, file number SN3758.\n8\n \"Working-class\" was defined by exclusion, the main criterion being occupation. Hence, for exam-\nple, police inspectors were excluded but police sergeants included. Most \"employers and managers\"\nand \"proprietors\" were also excluded. If in doubt, as for example in the case of the self-employed, the\ninvestigators were instructed to include only those household heads whose annual income was less than\n\u00a3250, this being the upper income threshold for National Insurance contributions. Investigators were\nalso instructed to exclude those households in which the householder was working-class but other\nmembers were not.\n9\n Despite instructions to the contrary, the oldest married man or widower was usually designated as\nhead, a fact which yields some advantage for the purposes of this article.\n952 Baines and Johnson\ngrounds that their earnings did not constitute part of household income.\nHowever, the rent and board paid by lodgers are counted as part of the in-\ncome of the primary household at that address. Earnings in the NSLLL were\nattributed to individuals, but nonlabor income, including pensions, was\nattributed to the household as a whole. The NSLLL distinguished \"earners\"\n(that is, the \"employed\" population) from \"nonearners.\" Those \"earners\"\nwith actual earnings were asked to state their earnings in the previous week.\nNonlabor household income, such as pensions, rent, unemployment, and\nPoor Law benefits, was also detailed in full. Finally, the sample excluded the\npopulation living in institutions. This was 0.3 percent of the total population,\nbut 6 percent of those aged over 65.w In common with those in receipt of\noutdoor relief, these were likely to be amongst the poorest people in the\npopulation. For example, people living in Poor Law institutions had, by\ndefinition, virtually no assets.\nBefore using the NSLLL data, we need to confirm that the labor-force\ncharacteristics of the sample were representative of the London population\nfrom which it was drawn. In theory, there should be a close correspondence\nbetween NSLLL participation rates and those revealed by the 1931 census,\nalthough the absence of nonmanual workers from the NSLLL means that the\nrelationship will not be exact. Unfortunately, in the 1931 census age-specific\noccupational data for adults were reported only at the national level, so no\ndirect comparison of sample and census age-specific participation rates can\nbe made. Moreover, the participation rate in London may have differed from\nthe national rate because of regional differences in either the overall occupa-\ntional structure, or in the age-specific propensity to work. We can allow for\nthe potential effect of regional differences in occupational structure by as-\nsuming that the proportion of elderly to total workers in each of the 31 occu-\npational groups in the census was the same in London as at the national\nlevel. This produces estimates of age-specific participation rates for London\nin 1931 which take account of the fact that the occupational structure of\nLondon was significantly different from that of England and Wales. The\nreliability of this procedure can be assessed by considering data from the\n1921 census, which reported age-specific occupational information for both\nLondon and for England and Wales. For 1921, therefore, we can apply the\nsame adjustment method used for 1931, and compare the estimated age-\nspecific participation rates for London with the actual rates.

The census in-\nvited all adults to denominate their occupation, or to explicitly state that they\nhad retired from their previous gainful occupation. Unemployed and casual\nworkers were recorded in the census as occupied, as were all adults who\ncould report a previous occupation, and who had not yet resolved to declare\nthemselves to be fully retired from the labor market. The NSLLL, on the\nother hand, categorized respondents by one of seven different employment\nstates: \"not in labor force,\" \"employed,\" \"self-employed,\" \"unemployed,\"\n\"sick\/incapacitated,\" \"on strike,\" and \"unknown\/other.\" In addition it asked\nfor details of the employer and place of employment, and for earnings last\nweek and in a \"normal\" week. The NSLLL was, therefore, both more precise\nand more demanding in its requirements than was the census. This could\naffect the declared labor-market status of older, marginal workers in particu-\nlar. It is probable that some older men who were no longer employed and\nwho would not work again reported themselves in the census as having an\noccupation, since at the time of the census they had not accepted that their\nnonemployed status was permanent. This was certainly true in Liverpool, for\n954 Baines and Johnson\nTABLE 2\nALTERNATIVE MEASURES OF LABOR-FORCE PARTICIPATION RATES OF OLDER MEN,\n1931\nAge Group\n60-64\n65 and up\n65-69\n70-74\n75 and up\nCensus of\nEngland\nand Wales\n(%)\n87.2\n47.5\n64.9\n41.7\n22.8\nEstimate for\nLondon\n(%)\n88.1\n49.4\n67.1\n43.2\n23.9\nin Labor\nForce\n(%)\n89.0\n38.3\n57.6\n30.1\n12.6\nNSLLL Sample\nwith Earnings\n(%)\n67.1\n27.8\n42.6\n21.6\n8.1\nUnemployed\n(%)\n12.0\n3.5\n6.1\n2.1\n0.5\nNumber in\nAge Group\n1,196\n1,859\n819\n621\n419\nSources: NSLLL dataset; and Table 1.\nexample, where a 1932 survey of dock laborers found that \"most of those\nover sixty-five who described themselves as 'earners' are ready to work an\noccasional day or two from time to time, though they might more accurately\nbe described as 'retired'.\"11 In the NSLLL, however, if respondents could not\nname an employer and a place of work, and could not report a \"normal\"\nwage, then they were designated as \"not in labor force.\"\nThe first row of Table 2 shows that, for males aged 60 to 64, the propor-\ntion of NSLLL respondents declaring themselves to be in the labor force (that\nis, in any employment status except \"not in labor force\") was only margin-\nally (0.9 percent) higher than the participation rate for this age group re-\ncorded in the census. The similarity between census and NSLLL estimates of\nthe economically active fraction of the population is not confined to this age\ngroup. The participation rate for prime-age males (21 to 64) in England and\nWales in the 1931 census was 96.7 percent, and of the more than 20,000\nNSLLL males in this age range, 98.3 percent reported themselves to be in the\nlabor force. This confirms that the NSLLL concept of labor-force participa-\ntion matches closely the census definition of \"occupied.\" It also indicates\nthat the compositional difference between the solely working-class NSLLL\nsurvey, and the census, which included all classes, had no significant effect\non the reported participation rates of prime-age males.\nOn the other hand, this close correspondence does not hold for men aged\n65 and above. The NSLLL estimate of economic activity for this age group\nlies significantly below the census estimate. For the 65-and-over population\nas a whole, the NSLLL participation rate is 11 percentage points below the\ncensus figure (38.3 versus 49.4 percent). We believe that the census defini-\ntion of economic activity is so loose that census data will provide only an\nupper-bound estimate for the true participation rate of older men. The\nNSLLL data on earnings provide an unambiguous lower-bound estimate,\n11\n Jones, Social Survey, vol. 2, p. 131.\nLondon Labor Market 955\nhowever, since respondents with earned income in the previous week clearly\nwere economically active. The true level of economic participation must lie\nbetween these upper and lower bounds\u2014between 49.4 percent and 27.8\npercent for London males aged 65 and above. Information on employment\nstatus allows us to narrow this range further.\nNSLLL respondents could declare themselves to be unemployed\u2014this was\na formal labor-market status that was recorded on the individual's national\ninsurance record. Moreover, from age 65 most men qualified for a contribu-\ntory pension; they could continue to register as unemployed at the local labor\nexchange, but they could not draw unemployment benefits in addition to\ntheir pension. For those aged 65 and over, therefore, a declaration of unem-\nployment brought no financial advantage, and is a good indication of genu-\nine but temporary interruption of employment. The lower-bound NSLLL\nestimate of economic activity should therefore include all those with earn-\nings, together with those who were unemployed at the time of the survey.\nFor males aged 65 and above this would set a lower-bound participation rate\nof 31.3 percent. The gap between this figure and the 38.3 percent of NSLLL\nmales aged 65 and over who were recorded as being in the labor force must\nhave been made up of men who reported themselves to be employed, self-\nemployed, sick, or \"other,\" but who had no earnings in the week of the sur-\nvey. It cannot be determined whether these men were casual workers, or\nnonregistered unemployed, or whether they had in fact already withdrawn\nfrom economic activity. The plausible range of participation rates for men\naged 65 and above in the NSLLL is therefore 31.3 to 38.3 percent, compared\nwith a census estimate for London of 49.4 percent, and for England and\nWales of 47.5 percent.\nCould the participation rates of older men as recorded in the NSLLL have\nbeen seriously depressed, relative to the rest of the country, by the omission\nof middle-class respondents from the survey? The evidence suggests not.\nThe occupational categories of workers recorded in the census cannot be\nmapped directly into socioeconomic classes, but three occupational sectors\ncan be identified as primarily middle-class: sectors 23 (\"Commercial, fi-\nnance and insurance\"), 25 (\"Professional\"), and 28 (\"Clerks and draughts-\nmen\"). Not surprisingly, these three sectors were significantly\nunderrepresented in the NSLLL compared with the 1931 census.12 However,\nwhile 2.83 percent of all male workers in the 1931 census were aged 65 to\n69, only 1.28 percent of clerks, and 2.95 percent of commercial and financial\nworkers were in this age range. The underenumeration of clerks in the\nNSLLL will, if anything, have imparted an upward bias to the measured size\n12\n The share of London's total male workforce aged 21 and above enumerated in these occupational\nsectors in the NSLLL and the 1931 census, respectively, were sector 23,8.71 percent and 14.28 percent;\nsector 25,0.51 percent and 3.57 percent; sector 28,1.77 percent and 10.95 percent.\n956 Baines and Johnson\nof the 65-and-over workforce, while the underenumeration of commercial\nand financial employees will have had almost no effect on old-age participa-\ntion rates. Among professionals, older workers were significantly over-\nrepresented at the national level, with 65- to 69-year-olds comprising 3.72\npercent of economically active males in sector 25; hence the under-\nenumeration of this sector in the NSLLL will have biased the measurement\nof the older workforce downwards. However, since this sector comprised\nonly 3.57 percent of the occupied male population in London according to\nthe 1931 census, the impact of its underenumeration in the NSLLL on the\nmeasured participation rates of older workers must be small. Its maximum\neffect would have been to lower the reported NSLLL participation rate for\nmen aged 65 to 69 by a single percentage point.13\nThe consistency of NSLLL and census participation rates for ages 64 and\nunder, and their divergence for ages 65 and over, suggest to us that the 1931\ncensus seriously overreported the level of economic activity among older\nmen, by 10 percent or more. This may also have been true of earlier cen-\nsuses, but we have no way of knowing. There was, however, no change\nbetween 1921 and 1931 censuses in the way the question concerning occu-\npation was asked. Although we believe that the 1931 census overstates the\nlevel of older men's economic activity, there is no reason to think that the\ndownward trend from 1921 is a statistical artifact.\nDEMAND-SIDE FACTORS\nThe participation rates of older men in London may have been affected by\nunemployment, by company retirement rules, and by rapid structural trans-\nformation. There were, of course, other possible demand-side influences\nthat affected older men, but they were either random or not associated with\nfactors identified in the NSLLL, and hence remain immeasurable. This sec-\ntion examines the systematic demand-side explanations.\nThe NSLLL was conducted early in the 1930s depression; we need to\nconsider whether such extreme macroeconomic conditions could be respon-\nsible for the low participation rates of older men. High levels of unemploy-\nment were widely perceived to have the effect of pushing older workers into\npremature retirement because they had significantly lesser prospects of\nrehire than did younger workers. Using distinctly postwar terminology to\ncharacterize the interwar labor market, G M. Beck has commented that\n\"mass unemployment, like area-bombing, is not selective of its victims;\nyoung and old, good workers and bad, suffer when a pit or factory is shut\n13\n The underenumeration of this sector in the NSLLL, relative to the census, was 3.06 percent. Men\naged 65 to 69 comprised 3.72 percent of sector 25, compared with 2.83 percent of the overall labor\nforce, so were almost one-third likelier to be active in this sector than in general. The total impact of\nthis underenumeration was 0.95 percent (3.06 percent x 0.31).\nLondon Labor Market 957\ndown. Re-employment, on the contrary, is selective. When trade revived the\nyounger men were in general the first to get back to work.\"14 More recent\nanalysis of the interwar period by Mark Thomas confirms that the higher\nunemployment rates experienced by older males in the later stages of the\ninterwar depression were a consequence of longer duration. In addition to the\nduration effect, though, Thomas also finds that \"older male workers were\nindeed more vulnerable to job separation during the early depression than their\nyounger colleagues.\"15 An explanation is hard to pinpoint, but it may well\nhave to do with longstanding beliefs about the impact of age on productivity,\nviews which the Taylorist fashion of the day could only have accentuated.\nThe NSLLL data confirm that older workers faced a higher probability of\nunemployment. Age-specific unemployment in the NSLLL, as in Ministry of\nLabour data, follows a U-shaped pattern, with rates falling to a low of 4.5\npercent for men aged 35 to 39, and then rising to reach 12 percent among 60-\nto 64-year-olds. It should be noted that the London labor market was quite\nbuoyant relative to the national economy in 1929 and 1930, when the major-\nity of the household survey was carried out.16 The average unemployment\nrate recorded in the survey for males aged 21 to 64 was 7.2 percent, slightly\nlower than the 8.5 percent rate among insured males in London, and consid-\nerably below the 15.0 percent for England and Wales as a whole reported by\nthe Ministry of Labour for May 1930, the midpoint of the NSLLL household\nsurvey. Unemployment among the entire workforce is known to have been\nlower than among members of the national insurance scheme; for the period\nfrom 1929 to 1932, Charles Feinstein estimates the national unemployment\nrate among all workers to have been around three-quarters the rate for the\ninsured workforce.17\nThe fact that the recorded unemployment rate among 65- to 69-year-olds\nin the NSLLL was only 6.1 percent, compared to 12 percent among 60- to\n64-year-olds, is prima facie evidence that approximately 6 percent of inac-\ntive males in this age group were pushed into retirement from a state of\nunemployment. Hence, we might expect a positive association between the\nrate of labor-force withdrawal above age 65 and the rate of unemployment\nbelow this age. We can examine this possibility indirectly by treating partici-\npation rates for age groups 60 to 64 and 65 to 69 as recorded in the NSLLL\nas if they related to a single cohort that aged over a five-year period\u2014in\nother words by using cross-sectional data to construct a pseudocohort. If the\ndecline in the participation rate for any particular occupation between these\ntwo age groups is greater than that for the workforce as a whole, then this\n14\n Beck, Survey, p. 56.\n15\n Thomas, \"Labour Market Structure,\" pp. 118-21.\n16\n The percentage of the 26,915 households surveyed in each year was 1928:0.1,1929:34.9,1930:\n49.3, 1931: 13.5, 1932:2.3.\n17\n Feinstein, Statistical Tables, table T128.\n958 Baines and Johnson\nindicates an above-average rate of withdrawal. By comparing these pseudo-\ncohort withdrawal rates with reported NSLLL unemployment rates for the\nage group 55-64, we can determine whether retirement rates were relatively\nhigh in the occupations with high unemployment. Contrary to our expecta-\ntions, we find that high unemployment was related to low rates of retirement,\nalthough the correlation is weak and not statistically significant (the coeffi-\ncient is -0.24, or -0.11 when the sectors are weighted by their 1931 employ-\nment shares).18 This is not a very strong test, but it suggests that unemploy-\nment before age 65 was not the most important factor in determining who\nleft the labor market from age 65.\nThe second potential demand-side influence on participation rates at older\nages was the impact of compulsory-retirement rules. In 1936 the Ministry of\nLabour estimated that about 1.3 million male workers were covered by a\nsuperannuation scheme; manual workers made up less than half this total,\nsuggesting that the coverage rate for the male manual workforce was less\nthan 7.5 percent.19 At least 43 percent of manual workers in these superannu-\nation schemes faced compulsory retirement at a set age\u2014in nine cases out\noften, at age 65. Coverage was concentrated in a small number of sectors:\ntransport accounted for more than 25 percent, with engineering, textiles, and\nfood together accounting for another 35 percent. Leslie Hannah has sug-\ngested that large organizations were more likely to operate superannuation\nschemes with compulsory retirement rules; and the 1930 Census of Produc-\ntion shows that railway and gas companies were the largest commercial\norganizations in London, with averages of 5,617 and 1,394 employees per\nestablishment.20 From the male occupational data in the NSLLL we have\nidentified 956 railway-company manual workers and 225 gas-production\nworkers.21 The pseudocohort withdrawal rates for all railway and gas work-\ners across groups aged 60 to 64 and 65 to 69 are 75 and 80 percent respec-\ntively, compared with 55 percent for the NSLLL workforce as a whole. This\nsupports the hypothesis that manual workers in industries with a high level\nof superannuation coverage were disproportionately likely to retire around\nage 65. It should be noted, however, that railway and gas workers accounted\nfor less than 6 percent of 'the NSLLL male workforce. Moreover, superannua-\ntion coverage was never comprehensive for the manual workforce in these\n18\n Due to the small number of observations in many occupational sectors, this analysis was carried\nout using data only for those sectors in which the number of unemployed males aged 55 to 64 exceeded\n30. These sectors (numbers 7,9,13,14,15,17,18,19,22,23,27,29,30, and 31) accounted for almost\n93 percent of older male workers.\n19\n \"Schemes Providing for Pensions for Employees on Retirement from Work,\" United Kingdom,\nMinistry of Labour Gazette, May 1938, pp. 172-74. According to Routh, manual workers accounted\nfor about 78 percent of the total in 1931 (Occupation and Pay, p. 8).\n20\n Hannah, Inventing Retirement, p. 42; and U.K., Census of Production, pp. 148-49.\n21\n Railway manual workers are those identified by occupational codes 5910 to 6094, and gas produc-\ntion workers are those identified by occupational codes 9050 to 9054.\nLondon Labor Market 959\nindustries; casual workers, for instance, were not included. No other sectors\nof the London economy came close to matching the size of railway and gas\ncompanies: the average number of employees in other establishments in Lon-\ndon was 92 for factory trades and 113 for nonfactory trades.22 It seems un-\nlikely that superannuation coverage in London exceeded the national figure\nof 7.5 percent of manual workers. Hence, the impact of compulsory retirement\nrules on overall working-class participation rates must have been small.\nIt is possible that the participation of older men was affected by a further\ndemand-side influence, the rate of employment growth in particular sectors\nof the London economy\u2014in other words, by structural change. Employers\nin new or expanding industries may have been prejudiced against older\nworkers as having had insufficient or inappropriate skills.23 We cannot test\nfor this directly since we have no continuous data for each worker. But it is\npossible to test for a general effect at the sectoral level by asking whether the\nrelative growth rate of total employment in each occupational sector in Lon-\ndon between 1921 and 1931 was related to any of three indicators for that\nsame sector: the degree to which the share of workers aged 55 to 64 was\ngreater or less than for the NSLLL sample as a whole, the unemployment rate\nfor 55- to 64-year-old males, and the pseudocohort withdrawal rate. We\nhypothesize that the faster the relative growth rate, the lower would be the\nconcentration of older workers, and the higher would be both the unemploy-\nment rate among older workers and their withdrawal rate. Looking across the\n13 major occupational sectors, we find the following weighted correlation\ncoefficients (along with the probability of the coefficient being significantly\ndifferent from zero): concentration 0.45 (0.13); unemployment 0.61 (0.03);\nand withdrawal -0.03 (0.93). Hence, the intercensal sectoral growth rate is\nfound to be entirely unrelated to the pseudocohort withdrawal rate, but to be\npositively associated with both a concentration of older workers in any\nparticular sector and a high unemployment rate among these older workers.24\nContrary to our expectations, older workers (employed and unemployed)\nwere not underrepresented in fast-growing sectors, but they did suffer signif-\nicantly higher rates of unemployment in these sectors. This may be taken as\nevidence of a demand-side bias against older male workers in the more\ndynamic sectors of the metropolitan labor market.\nThe conclusion that older workers were not underrepresented in expand-\ning sectors seems to be at variance with the frequent references in the pub-\nlished NSLLL volumes to the recruitment of young male and female entrants\ninto the expanding industries, which gives the clear impression that they\n22\n United Kingdom, Census of Production, pp. 148-49.\n23\n Political and Economic Planning, Exit, p. 5.\n24\n It is possible that there were individual industries in which older workers were being replaced by\nyounger ones despite relatively low employment growth, but our analysis is confined to the sectoral\nlevel because of the limitations of sample size.\n960 Baines and Johnson\nwere replacing older workers. However, this issue is not discussed directly.\nThe withdrawal of older workers is mentioned only in relation to compul-\nsory retirement practices in a few industries, and in only one of the three\nNSLLL volumes concerned with industry. Two volumes contain no refer-\nences to \"retirement\" or \"older workers.\"25\nTaking these demand-side influences together, we find that changes in the\ninterwar labor market are likely to have a had a negative, albeit small, impact\non the participation rates of older workers. Sectors in which manual workers\nwere most likely to be covered by occupational pension schemes do appear\nto have had above-average withdrawal rates; and since the numbers covered\nby such schemes almost certainly increased between 1921 and 1931, this\nmust have contributed to the measured decline in census participation rates\nbetween these years. However, no more than 7.5 percent of manual workers\nwere covered by superannuation schemes in 1931, and less than half this\nnumber were subject to compulsory retirement rules. Unemployment rates\nwere significantly higher for 60- to 64-year-olds in fast-growing sectors, but\nthe unemployment rate of older workers by occupation in 1930 and 1931\nwas not related to the rate at which older workers had been leaving those\nindustries in the 1920s. Taken as a whole, therefore, we find that measurable\ndemand-side factors provide only a limited explanation of the withdrawal of\nolder workers from the labor force.\nSUPPLY-SIDE FACTORS\nWe now turn our attention to supply-side factors that may have influenced\nthe economic activity of older men in interwar London. We focus on the\nissues of health, income, assets, and social-security entitlements. The health\nof older persons was likely to be an important determinant of their propen-\nsity to work, but we have very little information on this. The NSLLL did not\nask about general health status, and there are no representative survey data\nconcerning morbidity for this period. There are, however, some data avail-\nable on mortality. As James Riley has noted, the links between mortality and\nmorbidity are far from straightforward; but in the absence of better alterna-\ntives, we shall inspect occupation-specific mortality data to see whether they\nare related to measures of older workers' activity.26 We would expect higher\nretirement rates in those occupational sectors which experienced above-\naverage mortality.27 We find a positive association between the occupation-\nspecific standardized mortality rate for males aged 21 to 64 in 1931 and the\npseudocohort withdrawal rate (r = 0.16), but this relationship is weak and\n25\n Llewellyn-Smith, New Survey, vol. 5, pp. 150-51,213,245, 287,322, and 415.\n26\n Riley, Sickness.\n27\n United Kingdom, Registrar General's Decennial Supplement, table 1.\nLondon Labor Market 961\nnot statistically significant. More important, there is no association at all\nbetween the standardized mortality rate and the unemployment rate of males\naged 55 to 64.28\nA more promising explanation for the pattern of economic activity among\nolder workers is that participation was influenced by the need to earn a liv-\ning. We can investigate this by examining the financial information con-\ntained in the NSLLL. The average earnings of men in the NSLLL sample\ndeclined with age. Table 3 shows that average male earnings peaked at 722d\nper week at age 37, and fell to just 34d per week above age 75. The primary\nreason for this decline is, of course, the falling proportion of men who were\nin receipt of earnings. If we exclude from the sample all men who had re-\nceived no earnings and reported no hours of work in the previous week, then\npeak earnings of 788d were achieved at age 41, and although earnings still\ndeclined with age, earners aged 75 and above received 536d, which is almost\n70 percent of the peak age-specific average male weekly wage.\nIn addition to data on earnings, the NSLLL collected information on the\nhours worked by each person. This allows us to determine whether the age-\nrelated decline in average earnings per worker was a consequence of changes\nin the length of the average working week, or in the average hourly rate of\npay, or both. The third and fourth columns in Table 3 demonstrate that for\nLondon men over age 65 who continued to be active in the labor force, there\nwas a strong negative relationship between hours worked and age (r = -0.69)\nbut a weak relationship between wage rates and age (r = 0.08). This indicates\nthat there was very little occupational downgrading among older workers in\nthe metropolitan labor market in 1930. Of men aged 65 and above still active\nin the labor market, only 7.7 percent worked for less than half the average\nnumber of hours each week, and only 12.8 percent received earnings below\nhalf the age-specific average (compared with 1.6 and 3.7 percent respectively\nfor employed men aged 40 to 59). This is a surprising result. The great major-\nity of older men who were working were not clinging on to jobs at ever-di-\nminishing wage rates. It appears that few such jobs were available (or were\ntaken up) at significantly inferior wage rates, or on a genuinely part-time basis.\nA further indication of the employment opportunities available to older\nmen is revealed in the final two columns of Table 3. The sharp decline with\nage in the proportion of earners in the male population was matched by an\nincrease in the proportion of earners in self-employment. There is no signifi-\ncant difference within each age group between employees and the self-em-\nployed in earnings or hours worked, but the self-employed are, for age\ngroups both above and below 65, heavily concentrated in a narrow range of\noccupations, with 60 percent of them in sectors 13 (clothing), 15 (furniture),\nn\n Weighted correlations were estimated over the 13 major occupational sectors, as defined in note\n20, but excluding sector 31 (\"Other and undefined workers\")-\n962 Baines and Johnson\nTABLE 3\nEARNINGS OF NSLLL MALES, BY AGE\nAverage Earnings Average Earnings Average Hours Average Self-\nof All Males of All Earners Worked Wage Rate Earners Employed\n(pence per week) (pence per week) per Week (pence per hour) (%) (%)\nAge (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)\nPeak age\n60-64\n65-69\n70-74\n75 and up\n722 [37]\n511\n284\n117\n34\n788 [41]\n735\n657\n573\n536\n47.6 [35]\n46.7\n44.5\n41.9\n36.0\n17.0 [45]\n15.7\n14.8\n13.7\n14.9\n92.1 [38]\n67.1\n42.6\n21.6\n8.1\n6.6 [38]\n11.8\n16.2\n22.4\n35.3\nNotes: Peak ages, in years, are given in brackets.

We suspect that this pattern is a\nresult of self-employed tailors, carpenters, and shopkeepers remaining eco-\nnomically active in old age rather than former employees switching into self-\nemployment as they became older.\nOf course, earnings represent just one of a number of potential sources of\ntotal household income. The NSLLL data allow us to examine the relative\nimportance of own earnings, other household earnings, and nonlabor income\nfor all households headed by older men. The head of household was not\nalways directly identified on the original survey cards, and we have adopted\na conservative approach by attributing headship only to persons identified\nas \"head\" or \"husband.\" This gives us 23,706 heads out of a total of 26,915\nhouseholds. Missing data on age of head (some were recorded simply as \"A\"\nor \"Adult\" or \"Full\"), and exclusion of households without a male head\nreduces the useable number of male-headed households to 18,176.29 Figure 1\nshows, for all households headed by males in a given age group, the relative\ncontributions of household-head earnings, other earnings, and nonlabor\nincome to total household income.\nFigure 1 shows that the earnings of the head peaked at age 35, but total\nhousehold income peaked for heads aged 55, primarily because of the addi-\ntional earnings of other household members. From age 55, household in-\ncome declined continuously to age 85. The rapid fall in head's earnings, and\nslightly less rapid fall in other household earnings, was only partially offset\nby an increase in other sources of household income.30 From the discussion\nof earnings reported in Table 3 it is clear that the fall in head's earnings at\n19\n The NSLLL appears to have adopted the following procedure for attributing headship: where one\nadult male was present in a household, and not identified as a lodger, that person was designated\nhousehold head; where more than one adult male was present, the eldest was designated head; where\nno adult male was present, the eldest adult female was usually designated head.\n30\n We have assumed, in effect, that older men living in multigenerational households received a\nproportionate share of the income. It seems unlikely that they would have received a disproportionately\nlarge share.\nLondon Labor Market 963\n1200.0 -r\n1000.0 - .\n800.0 . .\n1 6 0 0 . 0 . .\nI\n400.0 - .\n200.0 . .\n\u2022 nonlabor income\n\u2022 earnings of other household members\nown earnings\n0.0\n20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55\nAge\n60 65 70 75 80 85\nFIGURE 1\nHOUSEHOLD INCOME BY SOURCE: ALL MALE HOUSEHOLD HEADS\nSource: See the text.\nolder ages was driven mainly by a decline in the participation rate. If we\nexamine only those households in which the head remained in receipt of\nearnings (Figure 2), we find a much more modest decline in total household\nincome from age 55.31 A comparison of Figures 1 and 2 indicates that, for\nheads aged 65 and above, the earnings of other household members were a\ncomplement to, rather than a substitute for, head's earnings, although non-\nlabor income was clearly a partial substitute for head's earnings.32\nThe hump-shaped household income profiles shown in Figures 1 and 2\ntake no account of household size and are driven in part by differences in\nhousehold size, and therefore are probably not a reliable metric of living\nstandards, for the simple reason that elderly-headed households tended to\nhave fewer mouths to feed, backs to clothe, and so on. To adjust for this, we\napply the OECD Needs Index, which gives a weight of 1.0 to the first adult,\n31\n This role of participation in determining the household income of the elderly has been overlooked\nin analyses that rely on labor-force survey data. For the United States, GTatton and Rotondo (\"Industri-\nalization,\" pp. 343-48) argue that old age was a period of high living standards, on the basis of labor-\nforce survey data from 1917 through 1919 which included only elderly-headed households where the\nhead was still economically active (the equivalent of our Figure 2 data). But the proportion of elderly\nmale heads with earnings declines with age. Hence reliance on labor-force survey data will give an\nover-optimistic view of the economic resources and living standards of elderly-headed households as\na whole.\n32\n It is possible that the limited extent of contributions by other family members may be related to\nthe fact that the majority of older men lived in independent households. Of the 1,813 households\ncontaining men aged over 65, 63 percent were composed of only one or two persons.\n964 Baines and Johnson\n1400.0 _\n1200.0..\n1000.0 . .\n800.0 - .\n600.0 . .\n400.0 . .\n200 .0 . .\n[U nonlabor income\nH earnings of other household members\n\u2022 own earnings\n70 75 80\nFIGURE 2\nHOUSEHOLD INCOME BY SOURCE: EMPLOYED MALE HOUSEHOLD HEADS\nSource: See the text.\n0.7 to other adults, and 0.5 to children under 18.33 Figure 3 shows standard-\nized household income by age of head as a proportion of mean standardized\nhousehold income of all 18,176 male-headed households (with or without\nearnings). This shows that heads aged between 20 and 40 lived, on average,\nin households with a standardized income marginally below the average.\nFrom age 45, standardized income rose above the average to reach a peak in\nthe late 50s, when it was 15 percent above the average. From this point,\nhowever, standardized income fell steadily with age, so that older household\nheads could expect standardized income to fall to the working-class average\nin their late 60s, and to be substantially below average thereafter. It is clear\nfrom a comparison of Figures 1 and 3 that the decline in standardized in-\ncome from age 60 is driven by the steady fall in average earnings of the head\nof household, which as we know was driven by falling participation.\nIncome from nonlabor sources provided only limited replacement of\nearned income for these older households. The NSLLL recorded 19 separate\nsources of nonlabor income, but few of these sources provided substantial\nsupport to many elderly-headed households. Table 4 reports the number of\nhouseholds headed by elderly men in receipt of other income from the six\nmost common sources of nonlabor income, together with the average weekly\nsum received by all elderly households, and by those receiving income in\n33\n Falkingham and Hills, Dynamics, p. 101.\nLondon Labor Market 965\n140.0 -r\n120.0-.\n0.0 .\n20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85\nFIGURE 3\nSTANDARDIZED HOUSEHOLD INCOME AS PROPORTION OF MEAN\nSource: See the text.\neach category. It is clear that only pensions and rental income made a\nsignificant contribution to the average income of the 1,528 elderly-headed\nhouseholds in the sample. The four other sources also provided significant\nsums, but only for the small number of households that received this type\nof income.\nThe number of elderly-headed households in receipt of income from\nassets was very small: out of 1,528 households, only ten reported income\nfrom savings, five reported income from property, four from private means,\nand two from trading profits. The low level of asset ownership recorded by\nthe NSLLL is consistent with aggregate data. The mean value of aggregate\nhousehold savings rates was only 4.4 percent in the period 1880 to 1914, and\n5.1 percent between 1920 and 1939, most of which was attributable to\nmiddle-class households.34 Paul Johnson has estimated the average value of\nworking-class assets in 1931 to be \u00a332.8 per adult, half of which was held\nin the form of long-term insurance contracts with friendly societies and\nindustrial assurance companies.35 It appears that even the most diligent of\nworking-class savers would have found it difficult to provide for an adequate\nold age; for example, the purchase price at age 65 of an annuity paying 10s.\n34\n The household saving rate is estimated as the annual change in the stock of encashable household\nassets as apropor t ion of income from employment Da ta are taken from Sheppard, Growth, pp. 18 -19 ;\nand Feinstein, Statistical Tables, table 1.\n35\n Johnson, Saving, p. 205.

The NSLLL\ncontains information on tenure, distinguishing (among other things) rented\naccommodation from owner occupation.37 Only 4.3 percent of the 18,176\nmales who headed households in the NSLLL were owner-occupiers. Not\nsurprisingly, ownership rates rose with age, from 2 percent at age 30 to 5.7\npercent at 50, reaching a maximum of 7.9 percent at age 75. These rates\nseem plausible for a working-class metropolitan population; it has been\nestimated that about 10 percent of all homes in Britain were owner-occupied\nbefore the First World War,38 and there was little change in these ownership\nrates until the introduction of cheaper and more flexible mortgages in the\nmid-1930s.39\nTable 4 shows that the most important source of nonlabor income re-\nceived by elderly-headed households was the state pension.

See the discussion in Richardson and Aldcroft, Building, pp. 2 0 9 - 1 1 .\n39\n T h e low ownersh ip rates in the NSLLL can b e contrasted with high rates in the Uni ted States.\nHaines and Goodman (\"Home\") report urban ownership rates of more than 20 percent for 3 0-year-olds\nin the 1930 U.S. census, rising to over 60 percent for 70-year-olds. These U.S. data are consistent with\nhigh levels of deliberate asset accumulation over the life cycle, whereas the NSLLL data demonstrate\nthat the accumulation of real estate was a strategy adopted by a very small minority of adult males in\ninterwar London.\nLondon Labor Market 967\nto a state pension at some age is likely to have reduced the individual's\npropensity to offer his labor in the market, because it lowered the opportu-\nnity cost of nonemployment by 120d per week. There were two state pension\nschemes in operation during the survey period. Under the 1908 scheme,\nwhich was last amended in 1924, a person was entitled to a noncontributory\npension of 10s per week at age 70, subject to a means test. A full pension\nwas paid if total annual income did not exceed \u00a365.25, of which only \u00a326.25\ncould be earned income. The pension was reduced parripassu above that\npoint. This meant, in effect, that there was no point in pensioners earning\nbetween 10s and \u00a31 per week. In fact, about 97 percent of those who drew\nthis noncontributory pension received the full amount. In addition, some\npeople aged 65 to 69 were drawing contributory pensions. This pension,\nwhich came into force in 1928, paid 10s per week to men aged 65 to 69, with\nan additional 10s per week for their wives if aged 65 or above, subject only\nto a qualifying contributions record; there was no means test. At age 70,\nthese pensioners were transferred to the noncontributory scheme, but in this\ncase there was no means test. Hence, the pension threshold was either age\n65 or age 70, with a means test in the latter case.40\nInspection of aggregated data suggests that the impact of these pensions\non the behavior of older men in the NSLLL sample was not large. As Table\n3 shows, there is no evidence that hourly wage rates or hours worked by men\nover age 70 were reduced to avoid the income threshold of the means-tested\npension. To test for a participation effect we fitted a cubic of age to the age-\nspecific participation rate for men aged 60 to 75. The fit is good (with an R2\nof 0.97) and there is no significant impact on participation at either age 65\nor age 70; the residuals lie within the standard error bands for all ages except\n74. However, since all pensions payable to people aged 65 to 69, and half of\nall pensions paid to people over age 70, were subject to neither an income\nnor a work test, it would be surprising to find evidence of strong age-thresh-\nold effects on employment. In fact employment rates among pensioners were\nquite high. In households receiving a pension income, just over half of all\nheads aged 65 were active in the labor force, and at age 75 the figure was\n13.8 percent. These are similar to the rates found by William Beveridge in\nthe early 1940s, when 5 5 percent of 65 -year-old pensioners, and 12.5 percent\nof 75-year-old pensioners, were still economically active.41\nHowever, the NSLLL information on sources of income allows us to deter-\nmine, for all male household heads, the association between the probability\n40\n T h e r e w e r e 2,069,080 persons holding basic pensions in the Uni ted Kingdom in 1930.

Owner-occupancy had a significant\nnegative impact on employment probabilities up to age 70, as did all other\nitemized sources of nonlabor income except income from subletting. From\nage 70, however, only pension income had any significant effect. The lever-\nage is quite large; for instance for men aged 65 to 69, owner-occupancy\nreduced the odds of employment by 64 percent, while receipt of a pension\nof 120d reduced the odds by 71 percent. However, the explanatory power of\nthese regressions is low, which suggests that many of the factors influencing\nemployment at older ages were unrelated to household structure or financial\ncircumstance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur analysis of the NSLLL sample shows that income peaked at 115 per-\ncent of the mean for households headed by men in their late 50s, and then\ndeclined continuously with age to reach only 69 percent of the mean for men\naged 80. This age-related decline in household income was driven by the\ndeclining employment propensities of older men. Data on wage rates and\nhours worked indicate that the metropolitan labor market was not flexible\nenough to accommodate older workers with lower-paid jobs, or a signifi-\ncantly shorter working week.\nElderly-headed households had very few savings or tangible assets. Public\npensions were the single most important source of income for nonemployed\nelderly households, and receipt of pension income was associated with re-\nduced employment propensities; but nonlabor income, household structure\nand property ownership together account for less than a fifth of the observed\npattern of employment beyond age 65. Some demand side-factors\u2014for\ninstance the compulsory retirement rules of some superannuation schemes\u2014\nappear to be associated with high rates of withdrawal from the labor force.\nSo some pensioners do seem to have been pushed out of the labor market by\na lack of appropriate jobs, whereas others chose to jump into retirement,\nattracted by the prospect of a pension income. We should note, however, that\nthese pensions were inadequate, on their own, to maintain income close to\nor above contemporary estimates of the poverty line. The maximum public\npension income for single and two-person households was only 49 percent\nand 75 percent, respectively, of a recent estimate of poverty-line income.43\n43\n Despite its stated intention to estimate the extent of poverty, the NSLLL did not, in fact, calculate\napoverty line. Linsley and Linsley have adjusted the poverty line estimated by Rowntree for the Second\nYork Survey so that the poverty line in London between 1928 and 1930 and York in 1936 would be\ncomparable. The budgets were not generous, covering little more than basic needs, as appears to have\nbeen Rowntree's original intention. The food component was what at the time was considered the\n970 Baines and Johnson\nOn the demand side, employers paid wages that were largely invariant by\nage. On the supply side, the effort expended by older workers declined with\nage.44 The gradual age-related falloff in effort was primarily an aggregate\neffect of the exercise of binary choices\u2014to work, or not to work\u2014by each\nolder man. There was only limited scope for older employees to negotiate a\nphased abatement of work effort by gradually reducing the length of the\nworking week, and virtually no scope for negotiating a reduction in the\nintensity of work effort in exchange for reduced wage rates. We infer from\nthe relative increase in self-employment among older cohorts that when\nworkers could directly control the amount of effort supplied, they were able\nand willing to continue working into old age.\nThis raises the question of why metropolitan employers did not place wage\nbids to match the effort offered by older men. This cannot have been due to a\nsocial-security reservation-wage effect, because all pensions commencing at age\n65, and most at age 70, were paid as insurance entitlements and without regard\nto the level of labor (or other) income. Little is known about the relationship\nbetween age and wage for manual workers in this period, but we note that in the\ninterwar labor market the great majority of manual workers were paid at time\nrates (usually weekly) rather than piece rates. Although the metropolitan labor\nmarket from 1929 to 1931 was buoyant relative to the rest of the country, there\nwas no evidence of excess demand for manual workers in London. Overall,\ntherefore, there was no incentive for employers to sustain the organizational\ncosts of offering more flexible terms of employment to older workers.\nSome older men were pushed into retirement by retirement rules and other\ndemand-side pressures. Others, facing a binary choice, jumped when the\neffort required to sustain full-time, full-speed employment could no longer\nbe sustained, or was not worth sustaining at the going wage. What almost no\nolder employees could do was choose a transition from work to retirement\nthrough a gradual reduction in effort and earnings.\nminimum needed to maintain health and physical capacity. It was similar to the Ministry of Health's\nminimum food standard of 1931. The clothing allowance was only sufficient for a \"moderate respect-\nability.\" There was an allowance for a newspaper but not a wireless. The allowance for all tobacco,\nbeer, presents, holidays, books, and travel was 22d. per week for a family of 5, or 4 percent of all\nexpenditure. There was no allowance for furniture or decorating. The Linsley\/Rowntree standard yields\na poverty line of 5*46d. for a family of two adults and three children, 321d. for a couple, and 246d. for\na single man. See Linsley and Linsley, \"Booth, Rowntree,\" pp. 91, 93-94, 97-98; and Rowntree,\nPoverty and Progress, p. 502.\n44\n A general explanation for this decline in effort with age, one common to all populations, is the\nimpact of morbidity; but we have no way of directly identifying its effect in the NSLLL data.\nREFERENCES\nBaines.D.E.
