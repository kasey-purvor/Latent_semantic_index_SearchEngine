Fe atoms occupy In sites and act as deep \nacceptor centres for free electrons [l]. In epitaxial materials, the achievement of SI \nbehaviour in selected areas is of crucial importance for lateral device isolation in \nintegrated circuits and for the realisation of laser devices with current blocking regions \nbeside the active region [2]. Thus ion implantation is an obvious candidate to selectively \nobtain SI regions in InP and InGaAs. With the increasing use of InGaAs and InP layers \nin heterojunction devices, there is a critical need to understand the behaviour of these \nmaterials upon ion bombardment for isolation purposes. The resistive behaviour can be \ndue to the damage related levels introduced with the implant and\/or to chemical \ncompensation due to the implanted species (typically Fe or other transition metals) [3]. \nIn nt InP and especially n+ InGaAs, very low sheet resistivity (-IO4 WO) was reported \nby several authors after implantation of light ion species such as proton, helium, boron \nand nitrogen [4,5,6]. Isolation was mainly caused by a damage-induced compensation \nmechanism. In an effolt to obtain higher sheet resistivities in n-type materials, we have \n*Fax : +44 1483689404, E-mail: p.too@surrey.ac.uk \n0-7803-7904-7\/03\/$17.00 02003 IEEE. 18 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Many \nauthors in the past reported on anomalous behaviour of iron during annealing [8,9,10]. It \nseems to diffuse rapidly within the implanted layer gettering at the surface and at the \ndamaged regions. These authors claim that high resistivity behaviour cannot be achieved \nby Fe implantation on initially n' doped layers. \nThe formation of good and thermally stable electrical isolation in Si-doped InP and \nInGaAs layers using 1 MeV iron at different substrate temperatures is studied in this \nwork. \nExperimental Procedure \nSemi-insulating Fe-doped InP wafers of (100) orientation were used as substrates for the \ngrowth of both n-type InGaAs and InP epilayen, with the (100) axis 2' off normal \norientation, using a Solid Source Molecular Beam Epitaxy (SSMBE) reactor. The n-type \nepilayers were doped with silicon with a concentration and thickness of 1 ~ 1 0 ' ~  cm\" and \nlpm respectively. The wafers were cleaved to obtain several samples of approximately 1 \ncmz for the prepamtion of the resistors. All samples were cleaned in organic solvents and \nthe clover-leaf pattem was printed on them using optical lithography. The area of InP \nand InGaAs samples not covered with photoresist was etched to a depth of \napproximately 3pm using standard etching solutions. The photoresist was then removed \nin acetone leaving the cloverleaf Hall pattern on the samples. \nThe samples  were divided into four different groups with implant isolation at \ntemperatures of -196OC, RT, 100\u00b0C;and 200\u00b0C using a 2MV High Voltage Engineering \nEuropa (HVEE) implanter. For -196'C, 100nC and 2OO0C implants, ;the.samples were \nmounted on a special temperature control stage. The centre of the Hall pattem for all the \nsamples was irradiated with Fe' using a dose and ener y of ~ x I O ' ~  cm-2 and lMeV \nrespectively, with a beam current density < 0.33 pVcm , The post-implant annealing \nwas performed in ' the range 100\u00b0C - 800\u00b0C ( W C )  for a time of 60s in a nitrogen \natmosphere, following a ramp up time of 60s to temperature. Ohmic contacts to the \nsamples were fabricated by applying indium and sintering at approximately 2OO0C for \n2min. The sheet resistivity, was measured using a Bio-Rad HL.5500 Hall effect system \nemploying Van der Pauw geometry at 300K under a magnetic field strength of 0.32 T. \nAll measurements were done at RT for samples implanted at 77K, 100nC and 2OO0C. \nThe Fe depth profiles of the implant isolated samples were obtained by SIMS using a \nCAMECA IMS6f instrument. It was used to follow the diffusion behaviour of iron at \ndifferent annealing temperatures. A 12.5keVO; primary beam was used to monitor \nFe in both InP ,and InGaAs, analysing the 50pn diameter central part of a 150pn \nxl50pmcrater. \nResults and Discussion \nThe projected range of .lMeV iron in InP and InGaAs is about 0.6pm and 0.4pm \nrespectively. The energy of lMeV for the iron beam is chosen to place most of the iron \natoms well inside the doped layer. In this way, the chemical compensation will be more \neffective for the electrical isolation of the InP and InGaAs epilayers. The effect of post- \nimplant annealing' temperature on n-type InP samples for the four different substrate \ntemperatures is shown in figure 1. The initial sheet resistivity of the n-type InP layer for \nall the samples is -15 WD. After iron implantation, an as-implanted sheet resistivity of \n-5x106 WO is obtained for substrate temperatures of -196'C, RT, and 100\u00b0C and that of \n4 \n56 + . \n19 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

After annealing the samples at 400'C for 60s, a maximum sheet \nresistivity of -lx107 N O  is reported for -196'C, RT and lOO'C substrate temperatures \nand that for 2OO0C implantation temperature is -2x106 WO. The sheet resistivity \ndecreases above 400'C but it increases again at 650'C to 2.1x106, 1 . 2 ~ 1 0 ~  and 2.6~10' \nnlo for -1960C, RT and 100\u00b0C implants respectively. This effect is not observed for \nsamples implanted at 200'C. The high sheet resistivity (lo6-- 107'WU) is maintained \nuntil an annealing temperature of 500'C for all four substrate temperatures. This wide \nthermally stable annealing window is extremely important from the technological point \nof view. \nWe believe that the isolation for iron implantation into InP is a combination of both \ndamage and chemical compensation. The deep acceptor level of Fe on an indium site is \nresponsible for the chemical compensation as observed in grown semi-insulating InP [l]. \nThis Fe deep level acceptor is annealed out at 600'C as reported by Kadonn et al [ 111. \nHence the decrease in the sheet resistivity observed at 600'C is believed to be the \nannealing of this defect level. The increase in sheet resistivity again at 650'C is believed \nto be due to a phosphorus vacanc iron (V, - Fe) complex defect which is formed above \nan annealing temperature of 600 C. Kadonn et al [ l  11 reported similar complex defects \nin InP for annealing temperatures between 600'C and 700'C. One possible explanation \nfor not observing this effect for 200'C implants is due to annealing of most of the V, \ndefects so that the complex defect responsible for the high sheet resistivity is less likely \nto be formed. The lower sheet resistivity obtained for 200'C implants as compared to - \n196'C, RT and 100\u00b0C implants is most probably due to a lower defect concentration as a. \nresult of enhanced dynamic annealing. Many of the defects created at such an elevated \ntemperature are annealed out or do not form during the implantation. We reported that \nfor a high dose ( 5 ~ 1 0 ' ~  cm-*), lower damage is obtained for higher substrate \ntemperatures [12]. Above 7OO0C, there is a gradual decrease in sheet resistivity for all \nthe substrate temperatures due to recovery of the carriers as the defects are annealed out \nand the iron diffuses out of the doped region (see SIMS data below). \nSimilar experiments to those just described were also canied out on n' InGaAs epilayers \nwhich had an initial sheet resistivity -32 QD. Figure 2 shows the change in the sheet \nresistivity as a function of post-implant annealing temperature which is similar in form \nto the results for InP (kgure 1). A maximum sheet resistivity of 1x10' and 2 . 3 ~ 1 0 ~  N O  \nis obtained for -196OC and RT implants respectively after annealing at 650'C for 60s. In \nthe case of l0O'C and 200'C implants, the maximum isolation is only -lxlO' W O  after \nannealin at 550'C. Similar to InP isolation results, the increase in the sheet resistivity \nfor -196 C and RT implanted samples at 650'C is most probably due to the formation of \ncom lex defects related to Fe atoms. As shown in figure 2, the sheet resistivity for - \n196 C implants is only two times higher than that of RT implants for samples annealed \nin the range of lOO'C - 5OO'C. Since all samples implanted at -196OC are measured at \nRT, a certain amount of annealing of defects may take place when the sample is brought \nup to room temperature, which may affect the isolation behaviour of the samples. We \ninfer that many of the defects formed at -196OC are annealed out as the samples are \nwarmed up to room temperature. A lower electrical isolation is obtained for hot implants \ncompared to -196'C and RT implants. This is most probably due to less damage \nproduction during hot implants due to enhanced dynamic annealing. Beyond the post- \nimplant annealing temperature where maximum isolation is obtained for all substrate \ntemperatures, the sheet resistivity decreases gradually towards its original value.

Restrictions apply. \nsuggests-that most of the defects are annealed out and that out-diffusion of Fe at \ntemperatures between 700 - 8OO0C occurs as shown by SIMS measurements (see \nbelow). \nFigures 3-6 show the SIMS Fe depth profiles of -196OC and 200'C implants for InP and \nInGaAs samples which have been annealed in the range of 100\u00b0C to 80OoC. The \ndetection limit for iron in both InP and InGaAs is 2-3x10\" cm\". The silicon signal is \nalso monitored during the SIMS measurements, showing the expected flat doping profile \nwithout any particular feature that 'could be related to those observed for the Fe signal \n(figure 3). An abrupt interface between the silicon doped layer and the substrate is \nobserved for all samples. The Fe degth,profile of the -196OC implants fits the TRIM \nprofile quite well,, but for the 200 C implants, broadening of the SIMS profile is \nobserved at the tail. One possible explanation of this broadening is the increased \nmobility of the iron during elevated temperature implants as a result of radiation \nenhanced diffusion: Also during 2OO0C implantation, the dynamic interaction of defects \nwith the injected iron could be another reason behind the tail broadening. The Fe profile \nfor InP and InGaAs samples annealed up to 65OoC and 550'C respectively, is similar to \nthe as-implanted profile for all substrate temperatures. In the case of InP, at an annealing \ntemperatures as high as 8OO0C, only a limited amount of Fe atoms diffuse from the \ndeeper side of the Fe peak towards the doped layer-substrate interface for '-196'C \nimplants (figure 3 ) .  No strong iron diffusion or accumulation peaks are observed at this \nimplantation temperature. For InP samples implanted at 2OO0C, the iron profile broadens \nduring annealing at 7OO0C and SOO'C. The, tail of the broadened profile extends up to \n1~ inside the substrate (figure 4). For InGaAs samples, above an annealing \ntemperature of 65OoC, iron atoms redistribute towards the surface and the interface \nbetween the InGaAs epilayer and the InP substrate (figure 5 and 6). These iesults are \nconsistent with the decrease in the sheet resistivity observed from figure 2. \nWe believe that the, immobility of iron in InP at such a high annealing temperature is due \nto the Si retarding effect on Fe diffusion. The Fe diffusion mechanism in InP.is not \ncompletely understood, although it is believed that Fe d i f h e s  with an interstitial - \nsubstitutional mechanism [13]. This diffusion mechanism involves the migration of iron \natoms from an interstitial position to a neighbouring substitutional one. Hence the \npresence of Si atoms on substitutional sites will reduce the vacant sites available for \ndiffusion of Fe. Van Gurp et al [14] have observed a similar retarding effect for zinc \ndiffusion in silicon doped InP. They reported a decrease in the diffusion of zinc with an \nincrease in the silicon doping concentration. \nConclusion \nA technologically relevant study of an isolation scheme using iron into n-type InP and \nInGaAs at various substrate temperatures has been made. The substrate temperature \nduring implantation is found to play an important role for maximum electrical. isolation \nand improved thermal stability of the isolation after post-implant annealing. Fe' \nimplantation at -196'C in both n-type InP and InGaAs is reported to provide hi h sheet \nresistivity without 'any diffusion of Fe' until an annealing temperature of 650 C. The \nimmobility of iron is a great advantage since the effect of Fe on the device performance \nwill be insignificant. These results are novel from the device engineering point of view \nand may have some useful applications for InPAnGaAs device isolation. \n% \n21 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.
