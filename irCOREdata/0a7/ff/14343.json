The issue of the\neducational quality of the program and its instructional features are considered in this paper, in\nassociation with the goals of the program.\nIntroduction\nA number of factors have converged today to force the development of more efficient and cost-\neffective educational strategies. These include rapidly changing technology, the increasing\nnumber of students in higher education, and resource restrictions imposed on all sectors of\neducation. Educational systems are therefore finding it increasingly difficult to respond to\nlearners' needs, highlighting the need for alternative educational strategies. An increase in the\neducational use of computers and new information technologies is often one of the suggested\nalternatives, baised on the premise that computers can support student learning in an\nindividualized way and at the learner's own pace. In this context, evaluation in general and\nCAL evaluation in particular can contribute to the process of defining and refining educational\nstrategies.\nThe Open University (OU) has included the use of computers to support learning in its courses\nsince 1971, and since 1979 attempts to evaluate the OU's CAL provision have been reported in\na number of publications. Despite a large volume of research into CAL evaluation, we believe\nthat there is a need to develop a more comprehensive and systematic approach which can\ncontribute more directly to the development of improved CAL provision.\n51\nCanon Tosunoglu et al The Works Metallurgist an evaluation of a CAL package on phase diagrams\nAims of the evaluation study\nOne purpose of this evaluation was to contribute to decision-making on the amount of CAL\nmaterials in courses. More specifically, our aim was to determine whether a particular CAL\nprogram was effective in contributing to students' learning about phase diagrams. Through a\nseries of studies, we aim to build up a more general knowledge of what features contribute to\neffective CAL in order to develop and improve other educational software.\nOur study aimed to answer the following questions:\n\u2022 How do students use the program?\n\u2022 Does the software contribute to student learning?\n\u2022 What do students learn from the program?\n\u2022 How can the program be improved?\nOur main concern is the learning benefits to students, and the relatively small size of the\nprogram helped us to investigate a number of aspects of the program in relation to learning,\nand the extent to which the program's objectives were attained. Fortunately, the objectives of\nthis program were already well defined, as it was developed in response to students'\ndifficulties in interpreting phase diagrams.\nPhase diagrams\nA phase diagram maps the ranges of composition and temperature over which particular phases\nare stable in a given system of materials. They enable the student to anticipate the alloys that\nare likely to have desirable properties, the treatments that can be used to develop best\nproperties, and the treatments that should be avoided (Newey and Weaver, 1990). An\nunderstanding of phase diagrams is an important part of chemistry and related curricula\n(Williams and Collins, 1994), although the coverage of the topic in many textbooks has been\ncriticized (Kildahl, 1994).\nThe phase diagram used in the Works Metallurgist is a binary system consisting of tin and\nlead, and it has commercial importance as soft solders.\nSoftware: The Works Metallurgist\nThe Works Metallurgist is an interactive tutorial designed to teach interpretations of phase\ndiagrams and the Lever Rule (a method of calculating percentage of solid and liquid in an alloy\nat a given temperature from a phase diagram) to Open University students who are studying at\na distance. It was developed for Materials - Engineering and Science, a second-level course\n(equivalent to second-year full-time study) which runs from February until October and\nincludes a residential summer school. Course evaluations had shown that students had\ndifficulties in interpreting and applying phase diagrams, and the program was specifically\ndeveloped to help students in this area. It is in a game format, and students are given job titles\nranging from Applicant for Apprentice Metallurgist to Works Metallurgist, according to their\nperformance.\nThe software is available for students to buy, and is one of five programs produced for the\n52\nVolume 4 Number I\ncourse. In order to run the programs, students need access to a computer with the OU's\nspecification (basically, a PC) and either Windows or GEM. The package is also available at\nthe course's residential school which provides another opportunity to use it.\nUse of The Works Metallurgist at residential summer school\nStudents used the CAL programs during their laboratory work, both while waiting for parts of\nthe practicals to reach the next stage, and when they finished the experiments early. Although\nthe program was designed for individual use, students mainly worked in the laboratories in\npairs, and usually chose to use the program in pairs too, and to discuss their answers with each\nother before typing them in. Three computers were also provided in the student hall for use at\nany time.\nSample and design of study\nThe population consisted of 540 students who were studying Materials: Engineering and\nScience in 1995. The researcher attended two weeks of residential school (out of seven) and\nconducted observations and interviews; The students had reasonable familiarity with\ncomputers, and were given a questionnaire, attitude scale, and knowledge pre-test, along with\nthe evaluation disk (a special version of the program that recorded some usage information).\nMethods used\nWe used a number of different approaches, and gathered different types of data. Our rationale\nfor using these different methods is reported in Jones et al (in press).\nObservation\nForty-four sessions were observed, with session times ranging from 3 to 53 minutes.\nObservations were carried out both in the laboratories and in the student hall. Students' inputs\nwere recorded, and where appropriate the students were asked to supply reasons for their\nanswers. Although the observer tried to minimize the disturbance to students' natural progress\nwith the program, she was occasionally asked for help with the tasks, and this was used as an\nopportunity to ask probing questions.\nQuestionnaires and evaluation disk\nA two-stage questionnaire was given to 60 students who were randomly selected from those\nwith access to a computer. Stage 1 of the questionnaire concerned previous OU courses, study\nof phase diagrams, and the students' computing background. Students filled in this part of the\nquestionnaire before they used the software in order to complete an attitude measure and a\nknowledge pre-test. Stage 2 concerned the efficiency of the program, the quality and nature of\nstudents' interactions with it, their difficulties, their opinions of the program, and general\ncomments. These 60 students were given a special version of the program which recorded\nusage information and were asked to return the disk after about five weeks. This enabled us to\nsee how much time students spent on the program, which sections took most time, and how\nmuch improvement on their understanding they made in that limited time.\nAttitude measure\nThis was used to obtain a measure of students attitudes towards computers and learning with\ncomputers both before and after using the program, although the post-use questionnaire also\n53\nCanon Tosunog\/u et ol The Wor ts Metallurgist an evaluation of a CAL package on phase diagrams\ncontained items related to the program, and was to be completed by students along with the\nsecond part of the questionnaire at the end of the five-week period.\nAchievement measure\nStudents completed a knowledge pre-test along with the first part of the questionnaire, and they\nwere tested again (using the same questions) after they had finished working with the program.\nFour more short questions covered the important concept of phase.\nInterviews\nFormal and informal interviews were conducted in the laboratories and in the computer suite in\nthe student hall. Tutorials related to phase diagrams were also attended by the researcher, and\nstudents' attendance and activities during the tutorial were observed.\nHow do students use the program?\nObservations revealed that The Works Metallurgist was the program used most during the two\nsummer-school weeks. Comparatively very little time was spent on other programs, and even\nstudents who had the program at home used it in the summer school. Most students who saw it\nfor the first time decided to buy it, if they had access to an appropriate computer. These\nobservations about its use and popularity are supported by the sales figures.\nStudents reported that the program was very useful, and most could only suggest making minor\nchanges to it. None of the students said the program was difficult to use, and they were easily\nable to use specific features of it such as Crosshairs, and the Draw Tie Line and Show Labels\nfacilities.1 The use of the calculator was found to be somewhat tedious in Windows, but less so\nin the GEM version.\nEvaluation disks returned by students showed that they spent a great deal of time using the\nprogram, ranging from 12 to 276 minutes with a mean of 128 minutes. Most of the students\nspread their use of the program over a number of sessions. The average number of sessions\nwas 3.6. Sections 1 to 4 require students to interact with the computer. There are also two\nfurther sections where students carry out the activity away from the computer. The overall\nresults for sections 1 to 4 are given in Table 1. (The total is given for all students across the\nwhole program. Mean, maximum and minimum values are per student for one section.)\nTime spent using the program (minutes) Errors made\nSections\n1-4\ntotal\n2440\nmean\n9.25\nmaximum\n36\nminimum\nI\nmean\nZ75\nmaximum\n13\nminimum\n0\nTable I: Analysis of returned evaluation disks (N = 25)\nAttitude scale and questionnaire\nFifty percent of the questionnaires were finally returned and findings from the returned\nquestionnaires are consistent with this positive view as can be seen in Table 2.\n54\nALT-J Volume 4 Number I\nStrongly agree Agree Neutral Disagree Strongly disagree\nI I did not learn anything new from\n19 9the program\n2 The program is capable of teaching\nabout phase diagrams\n3 The program makes you try to get a\nhigher job title\n4 Using the Works Metallurgist assisted in\nmy understanding of phase diagrams\n5 The program is helpful in preparing for\nthe exam\n6 1 still would have preferred to learn about\nphase diagrams from a tutor\n7\n4\nII\n10\n21\nII\n17\n15\n7\n1\n1\n8\n1\n4\n16\nTable 2: Items from the attitude scale related to The Works Metallurgist (N = 29)\nDo students learn from the program?\nStudents views related to the ease of use, value, learning, difficulty and motivational aspects of\nthe program were positive, and the aim of the software was clear to every student. They also\nbelieved they had benefited:\n'I think I have learnt more from this than reading the text book, it is very good, very good.'\n'I need it.'\n'Quite educational.'\nThe one student who was negative - 'I don't like anything related to computers' - initially\nchose not to use the program, but when he did use it later, he said to the observer: 'It's not like\nusing a computer, it's like a game'.\nPre-test\nPost test\nMean\n3.82\n3.91\nStd Dev\n1.06\n1.08\nN\n28\n23Table 3: Comparison ofpre- and post-test scores\nObservations supported their beliefs: students were observed to interpret phase diagrams and\napply the Lever Rule correctly, although they were unsure about this procedure or unable to\napply the rule correctly before using the program.\nHowever, the analyses of knowledge questions did not show any differences between the pre-\nand post-test scores (see Table 3).\nAs can be seen from the sample size in Table 3, there was some reluctance to answer the post-\ntest, and because the students were working at home, the timing and circumstances of the\npost-test were beyond our control. Nevertheless, the lack of difference between pre- and post-\ntest findings is surprising in this study as observations as well as the students' own perceptions\ndid suggest some benefit. However, there are a number of difficulties with the use of pre- and\npost-tests in CAL evaluation which are well documented (Jones et al, in press). Such\n55\nCanon Tosunoglu et ol The Works Metallurgist an evaluation of a CAL package on phase diagrams\ninstruments are not sensitive to the complexity of the learning situation, and may not reveal\nanything about the learning process itself. Indeed, data from the evaluation disks clearly\nshows that the time spent and errors made in each section decreased with repeated use of the\nprogram.\nHow can the program be improved?\nWhen asked about possible changes to the program, students suggested that it could be more\nflexible about spelling mistakes and routing of questions, and also include a Don't Know\nbutton. Students mentioned the following points when asked about difficulties: using the\ncalculator (27%), finishing the tasks in one session (20%), understanding questions (20%),\nunderstanding explanations to wrong answers (20%), calculating the answers (13%), and using\nthe mouse and crosshairs (6%). These findings again are consistent with observations. Fifty-\nthree percent of students reported that when they had difficulties using the program, they\nrepeated the program.\nThe program can be further improved by small changes in question order, and wording to help\nstudents understand the questions better, and by providing help for students in deciding which\nside of the tie line represents what phase (i.e. solid or liquid), simplifying the operation of the\ncalculator, clarifying the distinction between certain questions about solid or liquid\ncomposition, and allowing a little more flexibility with spelling mistakes.\nConclusion\nOur overall findings showed that this program was perceived as very useful and necessary by\nstudents. They also stated that the game-like nature of the program, or getting it wrong, made\nthem try again and again. This feature is very important because it shows that the program\nengages students, and as a result their chances of learning increases.\nThe clear and simple interface of The Works Metallurgist is among the positive factors\nmentioned by students.\nWe wanted to find out the extent to which students learn from the program. Our findings did\nnot show any direct relationship between its use and student performance, but our indirect\nfindings indicate that it can contribute to student learning.\nIn summary, The Works Metallurgist has certain critical properties that help its success:\n\u2022 students think they learn with it;\n\u2022 it is enjoyable to use;\n\u2022 it does not require too much computer familiarity;\n\u2022 it is highly motivational (humour, game-like format).\nNote\n1. 'Crosshairs' gives the temperature and composition of any point on the diagram when the\ncursor arrow is placed on it. 'Draw Tie Line' draws the tie line and gives the solid and liquid\n56\nALT-J Volume 4 Number I\ncomposition of a given alloy. 'Show Labels' gives the names of the different regions and lines\nof the phase diagram.\nReferences\nJones, A., Scanlon, E., Tosunoglu, C., Ross, S., Butcher, P., Murphy, P. and Greenberg, J.,\n'Evaluating CAL at the Open University: 15 years on', Computers and Education, (in press).\nKildahl, N.K.
