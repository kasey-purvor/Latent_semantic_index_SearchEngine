As there is a constant drive to increase the turbine entry \ntemperature, in order to increase engine efficiency, the coatings operate in increasingly hostile \nenvironments.  Thus there is a constant drive to both increase the temperature capabilities of TBCs while \nat the same time reducing their thermal conductivities.  The thermal conductivity of standard 7wt% yttria \nstabilized zirconia (7YSZ) electron beam (EB) physical vapour deposited (PVD) TBCs can be reduced in \ntwo ways: the first by modification of the microstructure of the TBC and the second by addition of ternary \noxides.  By modifying the microstructure of the TBC such that there are more fine pores, more photon \nscattering centres are introduced into the coatings, which reduce the heat transfer by radiation.  While \nternary oxides will introduce lattice defects into the coating, which increases the phonon scattering, thus \nreducing the thermal conductivity via lattice vibrations.  Unfortunately, both of these methods can have a \nnegative effect on the erosion resistance of EB PVD TBCs.\nThis paper compares the relative erosion rates of ten different EB PVD TBCs tested at 90\u00b0 impact at room \ntemperature and at high temperature and discusses the results in term of microstructural and temperature \neffects.  It was found that by modifying the coating deposition, such that a low density coating with a \nhighly \u2018feathered\u2019 microstructure formed, generally resulted in an increase in the erosion rate at room \ntemperature.  When there was a significant change between the room temperature and the high \ntemperature erosion mechanism it was accompanied by a significant decrease in the erosion rate,  while \nadditions of dopents was found to significantly increase the erosion rate at room and high temperature. \nHowever, all the modified coatings still had a lower erosion rate than a plasma sprayed coatings.  So, \nalthough, relative to a standard 7YSZ coating, the modified coatings have a lower erosion resistance, they \nstill perform better than PS TBCs and their lower thermal conductivities could make them viable \nalternatives to 7YSZ for use in gas turbine engines. \nManuscript\nPage 2 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nIntroduction \nSince they were first introduced into gas turbine engines thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) have been the \nsubject of numerous research papers generally concentrating on one of three issues:  thermal cyclic life \n[1,2], erosion performance (or lack thereof) [3,4] and thermal conductivity (and how to reduce it) [5,6].  \nThermal barrier coatings consist of a bond coat, an alumina thermally grown oxide (TGO) and a ceramic \ntop coat (typically 7-8wt% yttria partially stabilised zirconia), which has a thermal conductivity of 1.8-2.0\nW\/mK for electron beam (EB) physical vapour deposited (PVD) TBCs and 0.8 W\/mK for plasma sprayed \n(PS) TBCs and is what gives the TBC its thermal barrier properties[5].  These differences in thermal \nconductivities are purely attributed to the differences in the microstructure of the two types of TBCs. \nHowever, the very microstructure that gives the PS TBCs a lower thermal conductivity, compared to their \nEB PVD counter parts, also reduces their strain compliance and erosion resistance which means that they \nare not widely used on aerospace gas turbine blades. The research into the performance of TBCs has been \nprimarily driven by two distinct factors; reliability and efficiency, which to a certain degree are \ninterrelated.  The drive to improve efficiency of gas turbines is essentially a drive to increase the operating \ntemperature capabilities of the various components (increased turbine entry temperature) results in an \nincrease in engine efficiency.  To this end more efficient TBCs are required to protect the components \nfrom the increase in operating temperatures.  \nIn order to lower the thermal conductivity of a material it is necessary to either reduce the specific heat \ncapacity, density, refractive index phonon velocity or mean free path.  Since the specific heat capacity of a \nmaterial is an intrinsic material property the only viable options to reduce the thermal conductivity of \nzirconia based TBCs is to reduce the density of the material or to reduce the velocity and or mean free \npath of the heat carriers, i.e. photons and phonons.  Phonon scattering occurs in crystal structures when \nphonons interact with crystal defects such as vacancies, grain boundaries, dislocations and impurities \n(which cause lattice distortions).  Generally grain boundaries do not contribute significantly to phonon \nscattering however it has been shown [6,7] that for TBCs grain boundary scattering can have a significant \neffect on the thermal conductivity, these issues are comprehensively covered in a paper by Nicholls et al \nin 2002 [5].  Essentially there are two methods to reduce the thermal conductivity of TBCs one is the \naddition of dopents, to introduce more scattering centres at the atomic scale and the other is to modify the \ncoatings structure, again to introduce voids and reduce the coating density on a micro-scale.  TBCs are not \nvery erosion resistant, typically a 7YSZ TBC has an erosion rate 2-3 times greater that the superalloy on \nwhich it is applied.  Although EB PVD TBCs perform better than PS TBCs the addition of 2-4% of rare \nearth oxide dopents can significantly increase the erosion rates of EB PVD TBCs [8].   Furthermore, the \nPage 3 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nmicrostructure of the TBC can also have a significant effect on the erosion mechanism which in turn \naffects the erosion rate; there are a number of papers in the open literature which discuss the various \nerosion mechanisms of TBCs[3,4,9].  \nThis paper examines the erosion performance of a number of different TBCs that have been produced with \nthe aim of reducing their thermal conductivities; the coatings have been produced with additions of \ndopents and or modifications to their microstructure, all the doped coatings were applied on top of a thin \nlayer of standard 7YSZ to ensure that there were no adhesion issues.  The aim of this paper was to \nexamine the affects of these modifications on the erosion rates of the coatings and to determine any \nchanges in the erosion mechanisms.  \nThe coatings investigated are shown in Figure 2 and can be categorized into 3 groupings.  Group 1 \nconsists of baseline t\u2019 7YSZ with density variations.  Group 2 has substitution of ZrO2 with HfO2 and \nY2O3 levels to produce t\u2019 and c (cubic) coatings.  Group 3 comprises two coatings that have significant \namount of REO (Rare Earth Oxides) other than Y2O3.  Figure 2 shows these systems.  The letter \ndesignation shows which samples were tested at 25\u00b0C and 850\u00b0C.  \nTesting\nThe erosion tests were all carried out in the high-temperature erosion test facility at Cranfield University.  \nThe tests were carried out at room temperature and at 850\u00b0C using 90-125\u00b5m angular alumina particles at\nmean velocity of 100m\/s impacting the samples at 90\u00b0. \nThe following figure is a schematic of the high temperature erosion facility at Cranfield University that \nwas used for the erosion testing.  It consists of a number of key components starting with the compressor \n(C), which supplies a pressure vessel (P). This is there to ensure that a constant amount of compressed air \nis supplied to the heating system (H).  The air passes through a convoluted path in the pressurised heating \nsystem, which is electrically heated, before entering the acceleration tube (T).  The erodent material, in \nthis case alumina, is fed via a screw feeder and a venturi nozzle into the acceleration tube, where the \ncompressed air accelerates the particles before they impact the test specimen in the chamber (S).  When \nusing alumina as an erodent the resident time of the particles in the hot gas stream is not sufficient to heat \nthe particles to a significant degree so they do not soften. The test samples are attached to a carousel, \nwhich is capable of holding six different specimens at different angles with respect to the impacting \nparticles.\nPage 4 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nS\nT\nF\nH\nP\nC\nFigure 1:  Schematic of the erosion rig.\nTemperature Range RT-850\u00b0C\nParticle Velocities 50-400 m\/s (depending on particle size)\nParticle Size Range 50-1,000 \u00b5m (affects the max velocity)\nImpact Angles 30, 45, 60, 75 & 90\u00b0\nParticle Feed Rate 0.2-1 g\/min\nTable 1:  Operating conditions of the test rig.  \nThe maximum velocity of the erodent is dependent on its size and density.  Small, low-density particles \nare capable of the highest velocities and almost attain the gas velocity.\nResults\nThe results of the erosion testing are given in the following table and graph.  As can be seen, in Figure 2\nthere is a large variation in steady state erosion rates between 11 and 51 g\/kg for the EB PVD TBCs.  The \nroom temperature tests can be divided into two groups those with an erosion rate above 40g\/kg and those \nPage 5 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nwith an erosion rate between 10-22g\/kg.  The high temperature tests can also be divided into two main \ngroups: the two samples with steady state erosion rates between 35 and 51 g\/kg and those with steady state \nerosion rates between 11 and 14 g\/kg with one sample set, the cubic (c) Hf modified TBC, sitting between \nthe two groups with an erosion rate of 20g\/kg.  Another important feature is the extremely large reduction \nin the erosion rate of  the Hf modified coatings between the RT and 850\u00b0C tests.\nThe bar chart in Figure 2 compares the HT and the RT steady state erosion rates.  In all except two cases,\nthe two standard 7YSZ samples (CC &E\/F), the high temperature erosion rate is lower than the room \ntemperature erosion rate, indicating possible changes in the erosion mechanisms.  Importantly, if \nunsurprisingly, the two sets of standard 7YSZ samples have very similar erosion rates for both the RT and \nthe HT tests, indicating that there is no significant change in the erosion mechanisms do to the increase in \ntemperature. (Also shows two unrelated coating suppliers can have same erosion resistance for their \nstandard coating).  The results from the literature are the maximum and minimum erosion rates measured \naround a blade that was section into 6 pieces for room temperature erosion testing.\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nLit CC A \/ B C \/ D E \/ F G \/ H I \/ J K \/ L M \/ N O \/ P Q \/ R PS \nLow k Compositions all have a 20\u00b5m baseline 7YSZ layer\nS\nte\nad\ny \nS\nta\nte\n E\nro\nsi\no\nn\n R\nat\ne \n(g\n\/k\ng\n)\n t'  7YSZ  t'  Hf Mod c  Hf Mod Plasma\nSprayed\n Highly \nDoped\nc  3 \nREO \n2\n0\n\u00b0C\n8\n5\n0\n\u00b0C\nS\ntd\n.\/L\no\nw\n e\nn\ns\nit\ny\n 1\nC\nra\nn\nfi\ne\nld\n  \nC\no\nm\nm\ne\nrc\nia\nl\nL\no\nw\n D\ne\nn\ns\nit\ny\n 2\nS\ntd\n.

However, some\nPage 7 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nlow thermal conductivity coatings are currently being used, even with the slight compromise in their \nerosion performance, for example the PWA low thermal conductivity coating.  Unfortunately, the current \nsituation with EB PVD TBCs is such that any effort to modify the TBC in order to lower the thermal \nconductivity results in an increase, sometimes a significant increase, in erosion rates.  Since TBCs erode \nvia a fracture dominated mechanism, both the hardness and the fracture toughness are important values, \nand extremely difficult to measure, as yet no one has managed to produce 7YSZ TBCs with higher \nfracture toughness.\nAfter erosion testing, the samples were all cross sectioned, mounted and then polished for E-SEM \nevaluation in order to determine the various erosion mechanisms that were taking place. As is evident \nfrom the graph of erosion rates in Figure 2 the results can be broadly split along the lines of composition \nand the results will be discussed in groups according to composition.\nt\u2019-7YSZ:  \nAll of the t\u2019 7YSZ erosion rates are lower than 15g\/kg while the two standard coatings (Cranfield \nCommercial, CC, and std baseline, E\/F) had virtually identical erosion rates at just under 11g\/kg.  The low \ndensity t\u2019-7YSZ coatings had an erosion rate higher than the standard t\u2019-7YSZ under room temperature \nconditions, however, more importantly, under high temperature conditions their erosion rates were very \nsimilar to the t\u2019-7YSZ coatings, in one case within experimental error.  It is also worth noting that the low \ndensity 7YSZ TBCs had erosion rates that fell between the minimum and maximum erosion rates of 13.9 \nand 15.2g\/kg reported in the litereature [10] for room temperature erosion testing around a turbine blade \nsectioned into six samples.\nAs can be seen from the SEM micrograph in Figure 3a the high temperature erosion of the low density \n7YSZ coating resulted in a fairly high degree of compaction damage, with near surface cracking running \nacross the columns just into the region of the compaction damage. \nPage 8 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n  \n(a)   (b)\nFigure 3:  SEM micrograph showing HT erosion damage to (a) Coating B and (b) Coating D, the two \nt\u2019-7YSZ low density coatings.\nThe SEM micrograph in Figure 3b shows an example of plastic deformation in the form of \u2018S\u2019 bending \n(Type II FOD) as well as some compaction damage.  In other areas Coating D, a low density t\u2019-7YSZ, \nalso showed a compaction and cracking damage mechanism similar to that illustrated in Figure 3b.  When \nexamined in cross section the low density t\u2019-7YSZ coatings have a more noticeable dendritic growth on \nthe edges of the columns compared to the baseline coating, which is likely to affect the fracture toughness\nand hardness of the coatings. However, under high temperature conditions the erosion mechanism of the \ntwo low density coatings changes from near surface cracking to compaction damage with some evidence \nof FOD type II damage, which results in a low r erosion rate. This compaction damage and the \u2018S\u2019 \nbending of Type II FOD allows the coating to \u2018absorb\u2019 more damage plastically under impact conditions \nresulting in a lower erosion rate compared to the RT testing. \nThe baseline t\u2019-7YSZ coating on the other hand exhibited very little sign of compaction damage with \nmaterial removal occurring via a near surface cracking mechanism with evidence of some cross column \ncracking.  The SEM micrographs, in Figure 4, show the slight difference in the erosion mechanism \nbetween the RT and the HT erosion of the baseline t\u2019-7YSZ coating.  In both cases predominantly near \nsurface cracking is evident with some cross column cracking evident in the case of the HT erosion sample \n(F), which accounts for the slight increase in the HT erosion rate.  The effect of the standard 7YSZ on the \nlow density t\u2019 is insignificant relative to erosion resistance (A\/B vs. C\/D).\nPage 9 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n  \n(a)   (b)\nFigure 4:  Near surface cracking in the base line t\u2019-7YSZ coating (a) at RT and (b) eroded at high \ntemperature.\nHf Modified TBCs:  \nIn examining the erosion of the Hf modified TBCs there are three different issues to consider:  how the Hf \naddition affects the erosion, how the microstructure affects erosion and thirdly how the crystal structure \naffects the erosion.  \nt\u2019-Hf Modified TBCs:  Both the t\u2019-Hf modified TBCs have a higher erosion rate than their 7YSZ counter \nparts under room temperature conditions.  Previous research has shown that additions of rare earth oxides \nof Gd and Dy to 7YSZ TBCs results in an increase in their erosion rates[11], but Gd \/ Dy additions \nsubstitute for the Y sites thus increasing the overall stabiliser content, while Hf substitutes for the Zr and \ndoes not affect the stabiliser content.  In a similar manner to the t\u2019-7YSZ coatings, the low density t\u2019-Hf \nmod TBC has a higher erosion rate at RT and a virtually identical erosion rate at high temperature when \ncompared to its standard density counterpart.  But, most importantly, both of the t\u2019 Hf modified TBCs had \nhigh temperature erosion rates similar to the standard baseline 7YSZ, in fact the t\u2019 Hf mod TBC with a \nstandard density had a lower erosion rate than any of the other coatings tested under high temperature \nconditions.\nThe SEM micrographs in Figure 5 show the near surface cracking in the t\u2019-Hf mod coatings under RT \nerosion while under the HT erosion conditions there is significant densification of the TBC and associated \nplastic deformation\/compaction, which results in a decrease in the erosion rates.  Under high temperature \nerosion conditions the both of the t\u2019-Hf mod coatings showed a far greater reduction in their erosion rate \nto almost match that of the baseline t\u2019-7YSZ coating.  \nPage 10 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n  \n(a)   (b)\nFigure 5:  Near surface cracking in the t\u2019-Hf mod coatings (a) G at RT and (b) H at high temperature.\nThe SEM micrographs in Figure 6 show cross column cracking as well as near surface cracking in t\u2019-Hf \nmod low density coating eroded under RT conditions.  Under HT conditions, as can be seen in the \nmicrograph, 6b, there is a significant degree of densification of the coating and \u2018S\u2019 bending (type II FOD).  \nUnder impact conditions when densification and\/or type II FOD occurs a significant amount of the impact \nenergy is used during the densification and plastic deformation of the coating resulting in a smaller degree \nof cracking and hence a lower erosion rate when compared to a near surface cracking type erosion \nmechanism.  \n  \n(a)   (b)\nFigure 6:  Near surface cracking in (a) Coating I at RT and (b) Coating J eroded at high temperature.\nPage 11 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nc-Hf Modified TBC:  There are a number of issues that are immediately apparent when looking at the \nerosion results of these coatings. In all cases the Hf modified TBC with a cubic crystal structure has a \nhigher, in some cases significantly higher, erosion rate that their t\u2019 counterparts, for both room and high \ntemperature testing.  This supports the assertion[12] [13] that due to the fact the t\u2019 YSZ has a substantially \nhigher toughness than c YSZ, toughness of a material will have a great influence on the erosion rate, the t\u2019 \nstructure is preferable.  The c-Hf mod coating shows a significant reduction in erosion rate between room \ntemperature and high temperature and this is the first system where the low density version of the coating \nhas a lower erosion rate.\nThe large change in the erosion rate between RT and HT for the c-Hf Mod coatings can be ascribed to the \nchange in erosion mechanism from cross column cracking (the mechanism giving the highest erosion rate) \nat RT to densification and compaction with some cross column cracking at HT.  The densification, \ncompaction and type II FOD mechanisms all absorb a significant amount of the impact energy hence \nreducing the degree of cracking and the erosion rate.  So the more plastic deformation that the coatings \ncan accommodate on impact, the lower the erosion rate relative to the other fracture dominated \nmechanisms.\nThe fact that, for the c-Hf mod coatings, the low density coating has a lower erosion rate is also explained\nin terms of erosion mechanisms. Table 3 gives the erosion mechanisms for the coatings at RT and HT.  \nAlthough one would expect that the low density version of the coating will have a lower fracture \ntoughness than the dense version of the coating and hence a higher degree of cracking and thus a higher \nerosion rate, this is not the case when the mechanism changes.  The low density c-Hf Mod coating is the \nonly sample that eroded via a densification and compaction mechanism at RT in this set of tests and hence \nhad a lower erosion rate than the dense sample which eroded via a cross column cracking mechanism.  \nThe low density c-Hf Mod coating, eroded at HT, had a slightly lower erosion rate than the equivalent \nsample eroded at room temperature due to the fact that at the higher temperature it exhibited a greater \ndegree of densification and plastic deformation of the coating.\nPage 12 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n  \n(a) (b)\n(c)\nFigure 7:  Erosion damage in the c-Hf Mod coating K (a) at RT, (b) and (c) Coating L at high temperature.\nThe SEM micrographs in Figure 7 show cross column cracking in the c-Hf Mod coating eroded under RT \nconditions.  Under high temperature erosion conditions there is some evidence of compaction damage and \ndensification; however, there is also evidence of significant subsurface damage which appears to \naccumulate for a long time before a significant amount of material is suddenly lost from the coating.  This \nis illustrated by the step in the coating in Figure 7c and was accompanied by a sudden increase in mass \nloss.  Such a sudden increase in mass loss normally indicates penetration to the bond coat, which is the \npoint at which the test is stoppe.  On the other hand under room temperature conditions (sample K) had an \ninitial incubation period of low material loss followed by a steady state erosion rate that was very high.\nAs can be seen from the micrographs in Figure 8 both coatings erode via the same mechanism of \ncompaction damage and cross column cracking, with the sample tested at high temperature showing a \nPage 13 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nhigher degree of densification and compaction, i.e. at HT the coating is able to absorb more of the impact \nenergy plastically, resulting in a decrease in the degree of cracking and hence a slight decrease in erosion \nrate.  This is very similar to erosion mechanism identified by Steenbakker while conducting erosion \ntesting at RT and HT on gadolinia doped TBCs, although in that case the mechanism was only observed to \noccur during the HT erosion testing[8].\n  \n(a)   (b)\nFigure 8:  Near surface and cross column cracking with associated surface regions of densification in the \nc-Hf mod TBC Coating M (a) at RT and (b) Coating N at high temperature.\nc-3 REOs and Highly Doped TBCs:\nThe final modified coatings to discuss all had highly modified top coats compared to a standard 7YSZ \nTBC.  All four samples had high erosion rates with the predominant mechanism being cross column \ncracking.  There appears to be no difference between the erosion mechanisms at RT and HT for the \ncoating with 3 REOs as illustrated in the SEM micrographs in Figure 9, with both samples eroding via a \ncross column cracking mechanism.  However, one could argue that there is evidence of a small degree of \ndensification occurring under the HT erosion conditions, which would account for the slight reduction in \nerosion rate at the higher temperature.\nPage 14 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n  \n(a) (b)\n(c)\nFigure 9:  Near surface and cross column cracking in the coatings with 3 REO additions (a) Coating O at \nRT, (b) and (c) Coating P at high temperature.\nAgain as illustrated in the two SEM micrographs in Figure 10 in the highly doped coating there is very \nlittle difference in the erosion mechanisms between the two samples, one tested at room temperature the \nsecond at high temperature, with both eroding via a cross column type mechanism with associated near \nsurface cracking.  However, as can be seen in the left hand side of the micrograph of coating R there is \nevidence of the columns bending in a Type II FOD manner.  Although the bending has resulted in \ncracking it still shows some degree of plasticity, and again this would account for the slight drop in \nerosion rate between RT and HT for these coatings.  \nPage 15 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n  \n(a) (b)\nFigure 10:  Near surface cracking in (a) Coating Q at RT and (b) Coating R eroded at high temperature.\nUnder both the RT and the HT test conditions, these four coatings exhibited erosion rates which were \nsignificantly higher than all of the t\u2019 coatings.  \nErosion mechanisms:  \nThe data in Table 3 summarises the various erosion mechanisms that have been observed during the \ncourse of this investigation.  The results support previous work which suggested that material loss via a \nnear surface cracking mechanism results in the lowest erosion rates and that loss via cross column \ncracking results in high erosion rates, while a densification \/ compaction type mechanism operating in \nconjunction with other mechanisms can help to reduce the erosion rate.  \nForeign object damage (FOD) can occur as two distinct mechanisms Type I and Type II [9] and while it is \nwell known that FOD type I results in significant damage to the coating with high mass loss rates, \nespecially when the impact damage penetrates to the ceramic\/TGO interface, the severity of FOD type II \nhas been less well understood.  This paper has shown that, as long as the damage does not extend to the \ninterface, the FOD type II erosion mechanism, due to it\u2019s ability to dissipate impact energy via \ndensification and plastic deformation (in the form of \u2018S\u2019 buckling) can act to reduce the erosion rate of EB \nPVD TBCs.\nPage 16 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nSample Erosion Mechanism\/s Rate\nA Near surface cracking Low\nB Densification with compaction and cracking with some Type II FOD Low\nC Near surface cracking Low\nD Densification with compaction and cracking with some Type II FOD Low\nE Near surface Cracking Low\nF Near surface cracking with some cross cracking Low\nG Near surface cracking Low\nH Densification with compaction and cracking Low\nI Near surface cracking and cross column cracking Medium\nJ Densification and compaction with some Type II FOD Low\nK Cross column cracking High\nL Densification and compaction with cross column cracking Medium\nM Compaction damage and cross column cracking Medium\nN Significant densification and compaction with cross column cracking Low\nO Cross column Cracking High\nP Cross Column cracking (with possibly a small amount of densification) High\nQ Cross column cracking High\nR Cross Column cracking (with a small degree of FOD Type II damage) High\nTable 3:  Erosion mechanisms for the different samples under RT and HT conditions.\n6. Conclusions\nWith one exception, the t\u2019 Hf modified coating tested at 850\u00b0C, all the low thermal conductivity coatings \nhad a higher erosion rate that the baseline 7YSZ.  The t\u2019 Hf modified coating tested at 850\u00b0C showed a \nreduction in erosion rate due to a change in mechanism.  Essentially this paper has shown that trying to \nreduce the thermal conductivity of TBCs by changing the density (and hence the microstructure), adding \none or more rare earth oxide dopents and \/ or changing the crystal structure all result in an increase in the \nerosion rate of TBCs by different degrees.  More specifically this paper has demonstrated that:\n\uf0b7 All the EB PVD coatings tested had an erosion rate lower than that of plasma sprayed 7YSZ \nTBCs.\nPage 17 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n\uf0b7 Under room temperature erosion conditions the modified TBC systems all had a higher erosion \nrate than the standard 7YSZ TBC.\n\uf0b7 Under high temperature erosion conditions all the doped TBCs had a higher erosion rate than the \nstandard 7YSZ TBC, except for sample H (the t\u2019 Hf modified coating) which had a very slightly \nlower erosion rate.\n\uf0b7 The standard 7YSZ TBCs showed a very slight increase in erosion rate with temperature.\n\uf0b7 The doped TBC systems all showed a significant decrease in erosion rate with temperature.\n\uf0b7 The decrease in the erosion rate under high temperature conditions was attributed to either a \ncomplete change in erosion mechanism and\/or the introduction of densification and plastic \ndeformation within the coatings during high temperature erosion.\n\uf0b7 Under high temperature erosion conditions the Hf modified t\u2019 coatings performed as well or better \nthan the standard 7YSZ coatings.\nReference List\n1.
