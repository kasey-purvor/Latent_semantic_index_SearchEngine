Several pneumococcal\nproteins and enzymes have been implicated in the virulence of this\nbacterium and the pathogenesis of pneumonia [3]. Pneumolysin\n(PLN) is a protein expressed by Streptococcus pneumoniae intracellu-\nlarly and\/or in the cell wall, that is present in virtually all clinical\nisolates [4,5,6]. PLN is considered to be an important virulence\nfactor of the pneumococcus. Indeed, mice infected with a PLN-\ndeficient strain of S. pneumoniae showed a reduced lethality and a\ndiminished inflammatory response when compared to animals\ninfected with PLN-producing S. pneumoniae [7,8]. PLN remains\nwithin the pneumococcus during bacterial growth, but is released\nwhen the pathogen autodestructs by expressing autolysin [9] or\nafter destruction by the host immune system or antibiotic\ntreatment [10]. In addition, a recent report raised doubt as to\nwhether PLN truly is an intracellular protein, showing that PLN\nprimarily localized to the cell wall compartment during growth of\npneumococci in the absence of detectable cell lysis [6]. At low\ndoses, PLN activates the classical pathway of the complement\nsystem, induces cytokine production by macrophages and\nmonocytes, inhibits the migration, respiratory burst and antibac-\nterial activity of neutrophils and macrophages and affects ciliary\nbeating of epithelial cells [11\u201315]. At high doses, PLN can induce\ncell death; PLN interacts with cholesterol in the host-cell\nmembrane resulting in the formation of transmembrane pores\nand death of the host (immune) cell [16]. Our laboratory recently\ndemonstrated that purified PLN induces neutrophil influx and the\nproduction of cytokines and chemokines in the lungs of mice [17].\nIn addition, PLN dose dependently induced vascular permeability\nand pulmonary edema in mice [18,19]. Together these data\nsuggest that PLN has a strong impact on the host response to\ninvasion of the lower respiratory tract by S. pneumoniae.\nToll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors that\nsense the presence of microorganisms by virtue of their capacity to\nrecognize pathogen associated molecular patterns [20]. Recent studies\nhave shown that PLN is recognized by TLR4 in vitro [21\u201325].\nKnowledge on the role of TLRs in PLN-induced inflammation in the\nlung in vivo is limited: one investigation reported that the induction of\nplasminogen activator inhibitor type (PAI-1) I gene expression by PLN\nin the lungs of mice at least in part depends on TLR4 [26]. The\nprimary objective of this study was to determine the roles of TLR2 and\nTLR4 in the pulmonary effects of purified PLN in mice in vivo.\nMethods\nCell Cultures\nHuman embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells [27] transfected\nwith CD14 and TLR2 or TLR4 (kindly provided by Douglas\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 11 | e7993\nGolenbock, Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology,\nUniversity of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA) were\ngrown in DMEM (1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin,\nstreptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum). The murine alveolar\nmacrophage cell line MH-S (American Type Culture Collection,\nRockville, MD) was grown in RPMI 1640 (1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM\nL-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine\nserum). In vitro stimulation was conducted in 96-well plates\n(Greiner, Alphen aan de Rijn, the Netherlands) at a density of\n16105 cells\/ml. All cell lines were allowed to adhere overnight at\n37uC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and\nstimulated the next day for 6 hours. For all stimulations, HEK\ncells were co incubated with supernatant from MD-2-excreting\nHEK cells [27\u201329] together with either highly purified PLN\n(purified from Escherichia coli strain JM109 expressing a functional\npln gene as previously described [30]), lipopolysaccharide (LPS\nfrom Escherichia coli O111:B4, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or\nlipoteichoic acid (LTA from Staphylococcus aureus) [31]. Contami-\nnation of LPS in our PLN preparation was 4.6 ng\/mg PLN as\ndetermined with the chromogenic Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate\nassay (LAL assay) [32]. In some experiments polymyxin B (Sigma\nAldrich) was used at 10 mg\/ml.\nMTT Assay\nSupernatant of stimulated cells was removed and cells were\nincubated for 1\u20132 hours at 37uC with 100 ml 10% MTT (3-(4,\n5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Sigma\nAldrich) solution (5 mg\/ml) in medium. Thereafter MTT solution\nwas replaced and cells were incubated with acetic isopropanol and\nfirmly resuspended to dissolve violet crystals and incubated for\n10 minutes. OD of 560 nm was used to measure metabolic activity\nand corrected for cell debris by OD 655 nm [33].\nAnimals\nSpecific pathogen free 8\u201310 weeks old C57BL\/6 wild-type\n(WT) mice were purchased from Charles River (Maastricht, The\nNetherlands). TLR2 knockout (KO) mice and TLR4 KO mice\n(kindly provided by Shizuo Akira, Exploratory Research for\nAdvanced Technology, Japan Science and Technology Agency,\nSuita, Osaka, Japan) were generated as described previously\n[34,35] and backcrossed six times to a C57BL\/6 background.\nAll mice were bred in the animal facility of the Academic\nMedical Center in Amsterdam. Age and sex matched mice were\nused in all experiments. All experiments were approved by\nthe Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of\nAmsterdam.\nIn Vivo Stimulation\nIntranasal inoculation of PLN was performed as described\nearlier [17]. Briefly, mice were lightly anesthetized by inhalation\nof isoflurane (Upjohn, Ede, the Netherlands) after which 50 ml\nof sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PLN dissolved in\nPBS was administered intranasally. After 6 hours, mice were\nsacrificed and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. For\nthis the trachea was exposed through a midline incision and\ncannulated with a 22-gauge Abbocath-T catheter (Abbott, Sligo,\nIreland). The lavage was performed by instilling two 0.5-ml\naliquots of PBS. Lavage fluid was retrieved thereafter and\ncounted using Z2 Coulter particle count and size analyzer\n(Beckman-Coulter Inc., Miami, FL.). Differential cell counts\nwere determined in BAL fluid (BALF) using cytospin prepara-\ntions stained with modified Giemsa stain (Diff-Quick; Baxter,\nMcGraw Park, Ill).\nAssays\nMouse tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6,\ncytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (KC) and macro-\nphages inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 and human IL-8 were\nmeasured by species specific ELISA\u2019s (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,\nMN). Total protein level was measured by BCA protein assay\n(Pierce, Rockford, IL).\nStatistical Analysis\nData are expressed as means6SEM or median+interquartile\nrange. Differences were analyzed by Student T-test (in vitro cell\nstimulation) or Mann Whitney U test (in vivo stimulation). A\nvalue of P,0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nPLN Is Recognized by TLR4 In Vitro\nEarlier studies have shown that PLN is recognized by TLR4\n[21\u201325]. To confirm that our PLN preparation is recognized by\nTLR4, we incubated HEK cells transfected with either TLR2 or\nTLR4, with PLN. As positive controls for TLR4 and TLR2\nsignaling we also incubated HEK cells with LPS or LTA\nrespectively (Figure 1). HEK cells not transfected with TLR2 or\nTLR4 did not respond to PLN, LPS or LTA. As expected, LTA\nand LPS \u2013 induced IL-8 production was dependent on the\npresence of TLR2 and TLR4 respectively (both P,0.001 versus\nmedium control). PLN elicited IL-8 release by HEK-TLR4\n(P,0.05 versus medium control) but not by HEK-TLR2 cells.\nPolymyxin B significantly inhibited LPS-TLR4 signaling but did\nnot influence the effect of PLN on HEK-TLR4 cells, indicating\nthat contaminating LPS can not explain the capacity of PLN to\nstimulate TLR4. Of note, HEK-TLR4 cells spontaneously\nproduced more IL-8 compared to the other two HEK cell lines.\nOver expression of TLR4 in HEK cells has been shown to\nconstitutively activate NF-kB resulting in a spontaneous activated\ncondition [36] which could explain the elevated spontaneous\nrelease of IL-8. Overall, these data confirm earlier studies [21\u201325],\nshowing that PLN is recognized by TLR4.\nDose-Dependent Inflammatory and Lytic Properties of\nPLN In Vitro\nAlveolar macrophages in lungs can interact with PLN after\nintranasal inoculation. To investigate PLN-induced cytokine\nproduction and lysis of cells, we incubated mouse alveolar\nFigure 1. PLN activates HEK cells via TLR4.

In some experiments polymyxin B (P) was used at 10 mg\/ml.\nData are mean6SEM (N= 4 per group). * P,0.01 versus control,\n{ P,0.001 versus control, {P,0.001 versus LPS.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0007993.g001\nPneumolysin and TLR\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 November 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 11 | e7993\nmacrophage MH-S cells with increasing doses of PLN for 6 hours\n(corresponding with the observation period used in our in vivo\nexperiments \u2013 see further). TNF-a and MIP-2 production from\nMH-S cells (Figure 2) increased dose dependently after incubation\nwith PLN. PLN-induced TNF-a and MIP-2 production was not\naffected by the LPS inhibitor polymyxin B. PLN is known to\ninduce lysis of cells when incubated at high doses by inducing\npores into the cell membrane [16]. To further investigate the lytic\nproperties of PLN we determined cell metabolic activities by MTT\nassay; a tool to measure the induction of cell death [33]. Overall\ncell metabolic activity was reduced in MH-S cells incubated with\nthe highest PLN dose (10 mg\/ml), indicative of enhanced cell\ndeath (Figure 2; P= 0.06 compared to medium control). These\ndata suggest that PLN activates alveolar macrophages to produce\ncytokines and\/or chemokines at low doses, whereas higher doses\ncause cell death.\nRole of TLR2 and 4 in PLN-Induced Lung Inflammation\nand Injury In Vivo\nPrevious studies have documented the capacity of PLN to\ninduce lung inflammation and injury in rodents in vivo [17,18,37].\nIn preliminary experiments we first confirmed that PLN causes\ndose-dependent effects in the lungs of WT mice upon intranasal\nadministration with respect to recruitment of neutrophils and\nrelease of cytokines and chemokines into the bronchoalveolar\nspace, and with regard to pulmonary vascular leakage as\ndetermined by total protein levels in BALF (see below and data\nnot shown). To exclude biased effects due to contaminating LPS in\nour PLN preparation, we performed two control experiments.\nFirst, we inoculated WT mice with the amount of LPS present in\nour highest dose (500 ng PLN\/mouse; see further) which,\naccording to the LAL assay, was 2 pg LPS\/mouse. In addition,\nwe inoculated WT mice with 500 ng\/mouse heat inactivated PLN\n(80uC, 60 minutes), considering that LPS is heat stable. After\n6 hours mice were sacrificed and differential cell counts were\ndetermined in BALF. Mice treated with either 2 pg LPS or 500 ng\nheat inactivated PLN showed a similar cellular composition of\nBALF when compared with PBS treated mice, which was in\ncontrast to the neutrophil influx induced by PLN (Figure 3). These\ndata indicate that the effects produced by PLN can not be\nexplained by contaminating LPS. Thereafter we investigated the\nroles of TLR2 and TLR4 in the effects of two PLN doses: one dose\nthat caused modest lung inflammation and vascular leakage\n(25 ng\/mouse, Figure 4) and one that caused profound lung\ninflammation and injury (500 ng\/mouse, Figure 5). Intranasal\nadministration of PLN at a dose of 25 ng induced a modest influx\nof leukocytes into BALF, which was caused by an increase in the\nnumber of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils (P,0.05 versus\nPBS controls). In addition, PLN induced increases in the BALF\nlevels of TNF-a, MIP-2 and KC (all P,0.05 versus PBS controls),\nwhereas IL-6 and IL-1b concentrations remained low and similar\nto PBS control mice (data not shown). Moreover, PLN 25 ng\nelicited a modest rise in BALF total protein concentrations\n(P,0.05 versus PBS controls). These pulmonary responses to low\ndose PLN were unaltered in TLR2 and TLR4 KO mice with the\nexception of KC levels in BALF of TLR4 KO mice, which were\nreduced (P,0.05 compared to WT mice).\nHaving established that the contribution of TLR2 and TLR4 to\nthe lung inflammatory response to low dose PLN was negligible, we\nnext inoculated mice with a higher dose of PLN (500 ng\/mouse). At\nthis dose PLN elicited macrophage and neutrophil influx, release of\nIL-6, IL-1b, TNF-a and KC and a rise in total protein level in BALF\nof WT mice (all P,0.05 versus PBS control). MIP-2 levels remained\nlow and similar to PBS control mice (data not shown). Six hours after\nintranasal administration of 500 ng PLN, TLR4 KO mice displayed\nreduced neutrophil influx, diminished IL-6, IL-1b and KC release\nand lower total protein levels in BALF when compared with WT\nFigure 2. Inflammatory and cytolytic effects of PLN on mouse alveolar macrophage MH-S cells. MH-S cells were incubated with\nincreasing doses of PLN for 6 hours with\/without polymyxin B (10 mg\/ml ) and TNF-a, MIP-2 and cell death were determined thereafter.

Surprisingly, TLR2 KO mice also\ndemonstrated significantly reduced BALF levels of IL-6, KC and total\nprotein compared to WT mice (P,0.05). These observations were\nconfirmed in a second independent experiment (data not shown).\nBALF TNF-a levels were similar in WT, TLR2 KO and TLR4 KO\nmice. Twenty-four hours after inoculation of PLN at 500 ng\/mouse,\nthe BALF cell composition was similar inWT, TLR2 KO and TLR4\nKOmice and cytokine and chemokine levels were undetectable in all\nthree mouse strains (data not shown). These data suggested that the\ninduction of lung inflammation and injury by high dose PLN was\ndependent on the presence of TLR2 and TLR4.\nDiscussion\nThe pneumococcal cell wall consists of several proteins and\nenzymes that contribute to the virulence of the pathogen and the\npathogenesis of pneumonia [3]. PLN is a toxin of S. pneumonia,\nexpressed intracellularly and\/or in the cell wall compartment, that\nis present in all clinical isolates [4,5,6]. Several studies have\ndemonstrated that PLN is recognized by the immune system\nthrough a specific interaction with TLR4 [21\u201325]. The primary\nobjective of the present investigation was to determine the\ncontribution of TLR2 and TLR4 in lung inflammation and injury\ninduced by PLN in vivo. First we confirmed that our PLN\npreparation activated HEK cells via TLR4. We then revealed that\nintrapulmonary delivery of PLN induces an inflammatory\nresponse in the mouse lung that is dependent in part not only\non TLR4, but also on TLR2. Our data expand a recent\ninvestigation showing that the induction of PAI-1 mRNA in the\nlungs of mice at least in part depends on TLR4 [26].\nSeveral in vitro studies have shown that low doses of PLN induce\nproinflammatory reactions in immune cells like neutrophils,\nmacrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells and epithelial cells (10,\n13, 22, 24, 37, 38). Alveolar macrophages interact with respiratory\npathogens upon invasion of the lower airways. Alveolar macro-\nphages responded to PLN by production of cytokines and\/or\nchemokines in a dose dependent manner, whereas high PLN doses\ncaused cell death. Our current findings of PLN-induced lung\ninflammation in WT mice confirm and extend previous studies.\nSeveral investigations reported lung injury and leakage of the\nalveolar-endothelial barrier resulting in pulmonary edema after\npulmonary instillation and aerosol delivery of PLN [19,38]. In\naddition, installation of PLN resulted in depletion of the alveolar\nmacrophage pool and influx of neutrophils and monocytes; PLN-\ninduced lung injury was associated with only a small increase in\nTNF-a andMIP-2 levels in BALF [38]. In a study performed earlier\nin our laboratory, intranasal installation of PLN dose dependently\ninduced neutrophil influx and IL-6, KC and MIP-2 production in\nthe bronchoalveolar compartment [17]. Here we utilized this model\nof PLN-induced lung inflammation to determine the contribution of\nTLR2 and TLR4 to PLN effects in vivo. In line with previous in vitro\nstudies [21\u201325], PLN responses in the lungs were (in part) TLR4\ndependent: in particular KC release relied on the presence of\nTLR4, whereas other responses (neutrophil influx, protein leakage,\ncytokine release) were significantly reduced in TLR4 KOmice only\nafter administration of high dose PLN. These latter findings are in\naccordance with a recent study that reported attenuated induction\nof PAI-1 mRNA in lungs of TLR4 KO mice upon intrapulmonary\ndelivery of high dose PLN [26]. Remarkably, in the current\ninvestigation also TLR2 KO mice displayed a reduced responsive-\nness to PLN and this attenuated phenotype was not much different\nfrom that of TLR4 KO mice. A possible explanation could be that\nPLN induces endogenous ligands which may signal through TLR2\n(and\/or TLR4) [39,40]. One of these danger associated ligands is\nhyaluronan [40]. However, BALF hyaluronan levels were even\nlower in TLR2KO and TLR4KOmice than inWTmice (data not\nshown), suggesting that hyaluronan concentrations in BALF may at\nleast in part reflect pulmonary leakage. This however does not\nexclude that PLN induces other endogenous ligands which could\nsignal through TLR2 and\/or TLR4. The concept of endogenous\nTLR ligands amplifying host responses to inflammatory triggers is\nsupported by our recent findings that highly purified LTA, which is\nan established TLR2 ligand [32,41\u201344], induces less profound lung\ninflammation not only in TLR2 KO mice, but also in TLR4 KO\nmice [45] 47). The only earlier study that examined the contribution\nof TLRs in PLN-induced pulmonary effects in vivo did not address\nthe role of TLR2 [26]. In our experiments we could not confirm a\nrole for endogenous TLR2 or TLR4 expressed by alveolar\nmacrophages in PLN-induced KC or TNF-a release, since primary\nalveolar macrophages did not respond to PLN in doses up to 1 mg\/\nmL (data not shown). It should be noted that PLN can induce\ninflammation by mechanisms that do not rely on TLRs. In\nparticular, PLN exerts complement-activating activity that is\nmediated by a part of the toxin that is different from that mediating\ncytotoxic activity, and mutant pneumococci in which either the\ncytotoxic or complement-activating activity of PLN was deleted\nboth showed a reduced virulence in mice [46].\nSurprisingly, the lower PLN dose induced higher cytokine levels\nin BALF of mice than the higher PLN dose, which was especially\ntrue for TNF-a. Although we do not have a firm explanation for\nthis, differences in viability of cytokine-producing cells within the\nlungs and differences in the kinetics of cytokine release into the\nbronchoalveolar space upon administration of increasing PLN\ndoses may have played a role.\nThe PLN used in this study was manufactured according to the\nmethod of Mitchell et al. which results in highly purified\npneumococcal PLN [30]. Several experiments were done to\nexclude that PLN-induced effects were caused by LPS contami-\nnation. First, polymyxin B, an established LPS inhibitor, did not\ninfluence PLN effects on HEK or MH-S cells. Secondly, the\nhighest PLN concentration used in vivo contained 2 pg LPS\/mouse\nwhich did not induce an immune response in WT mice. In\naddition, heat inactivated PLN did not induce lung inflammation\nin WT mice in vivo, which - considering that LPS is heat stabile -\nfurther argues against LPS contamination. Moreover, the addition\nof soluble MD2 to HEK-TLR4 cells was absolutely required for\nLPS responsiveness, confirming previous reports [27\u201329], whereas\nPLN induced similar cytokine release by these cells in the absence\nor presence of soluble MD2 (data not shown). Finally, the fact that\nHEK-TLR2 cells did not respond to PLN argues against\ncontaminating TLR2 ligands.\nPLN is a major virulence factor in S. pneumoniae infections. We\nhere show that PLN induces inflammation in the bronchoalveolar\ncompartment of mice via mechanisms that rely in part on TLR2\nand TLR4. Investigations seeking to unravel the complex\ninteractions between pneumococcal components and host immune\ncells in the lung may assist in understanding pathophysiological\nmechanisms at play during pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Joost Daalhuisen and Marieke ten Brink for\ntechnical assistance during animal experiments.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: TvdP.
