ISBN 9780415776134261 \nFran Tonkiss, London School of Economics and Political Science  \nDebates over urban injustice, and the call for certain rights to the city, have gained increasing \nprominence in recent years. Searching for the Just City responds to and builds on a gathering body of \nwork spurred by David Harvey\u2019s (1973) Social Justice and the City, Iris Marion Young\u2019s engagement with \nthe city in her 1990 work on Justice and the Politics of Difference, the English translation of Henri \nLefebvre\u2019s essay on \u2018the right to the city\u2019 (see Lefebvre 1996), and Don Mitchell\u2019s (2003) development of \nthat idea in his The Right to the City: Social Justice and the Fight for Public Space. This edited collection \u2013 \na collaborative project between established and emerging scholars, and led by a group of doctoral \nstudents in Urban Planning at Columbia University \u2013 includes contributions by Harvey and two other key \nfigures in these debates in the US, Susan Fainstein and Peter Marcuse. The book arises from a 2006 \nconference celebrating \u2013 and, on the evidence of the pieces published here, energetically criticising \u2013 \nthe work of Fainstein on the occasion of her leaving Columbia for Harvard. \nThe book is organised into three parts. The first deals with theoretical arguments concerning the just \ncity, and attempts to \u2018urbanise\u2019 broader debates \u2013 liberal, communitarian and Marxist \u2013 on justice (John \nRawls, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Manuel Castells, Amartya Sen, Nancy Fraser and Young all figure here). The \nsecond section extends the debate both conceptually \u2013 Peter Marcuse\u2019s piece suggests that \u2018justice \nplanning\u2019 is largely concerned with post facto or processual problems of distribution and deliberation, \nand argues for \u2018commons planning\u2019 as a more radical understanding of how power relations shape \nurban conditions \u2013 and spatially, with pieces on the European city and Amsterdam in particular as \n(increasingly compromised) models of what a just city might look like, and on the severe injustices \nproduced within processes of Israeli city- and nation-building. The final section looks to cases of urban \nactivism, from local movements for environmental justice in New York City, to urban politics in Brazilian \ncities, to the baleful exemplar of urban injustice offered by pre- and post-Katrina New Orleans.  \nOn my reading, the strongest insights are to be drawn from those pieces that bring together original \ncritical arguments with a compelling analysis of specific urban contexts. The chapter by Oren Yiftachel, \nRavit Goldhaber and Roy Nuriel on the differentiated forms of \u2018recognition\u2019 afforded different ethnic \ngroups (Russian Jews, Middle Eastern Jews, and Bedouin Arabs) in Israel\u2019s government and planning of \nthe Beer Sheva metropolitan region, enlarges the theoretical discussion of justice, recognition and \ndifference in a context of stark spatial injustice. James DeFilippis\u2019 study of deregulated and unregulated \nservice labour in New York offers a compelling counter-argument to the thesis that globalisation and the \nrace for competitiveness drive the downgrading of labour protections, conditions and rewards in \nadvanced urban economies. While the sectors he considers rely on lower-wage immigrant and female \nlabour, driving taxis, caring for children and old people, cleaning houses and offices, washing dishes and \n2 \n \nsecuring buildings is not work that can be outsourced to distant low-income economies. Labour \nviolations in these urban settings occur in decidedly local labour markets: while the pressures of global \ncompetitiveness can offer an alibi for sharp practices, they are not a convincing explanation of them. It \nfollows, DeFilippis argues, that economic injustices in places such as New York \u2018are more often the result \nof class-based competition within cities than they are functions of any extra-local competition\u2019 (p.144). \nCity governments, both local and metropolitan, appear as key agents of urban injustice: especially \nthrough planning processes that reinforce the power of economic or ethnic \u00e9lites - not only in Beer \nSheva, but in New Orleans or New York. They also appear as potential and effective agents for justice. \nLocal government approaches to participatory budgeting, or local Agenda 21 commitments, have \nbecome common points of reference in current debates, but the role of local city governments in older \nforms of collective consumption and social provision \u2013 transport, utilities, public space, education, \nhealth and social services and housing \u2013 as well as the regulation of private exchange (notably through \nthe oversight of workplace conditions) remain key instruments in both distributive and \u2018commons\u2019 \napproaches to justice planning. The pieces collected here equally emphasise the role of non-\ngovernmental and community organisations in identifying and addressing urban injustice. \nThe editors recognise that the United States provides both the chief framework for the theoretical \ndebates and the primary context for the urban case studies their collection addresses, but are alert to \nthe broader and more varied problems of injustice in cities internationally. It might indeed be argued \nthat a focus on the United States is not misplaced in any study of the problem of urban injustice \u2013 the \nUN Habitat 2008\/9 report on the State of the World\u2019s Cities shows that the world\u2019s largest economy, in a \ndemocratic society governed by the rule of law, with a foundational commitment to its citizens\u2019 equality \nand various formal commitments to their basic welfare, has levels of urban inequality on a par with \nmany low-income economies with few or none of America\u2019s legal, constitutional and democratic \nprotections. New York was adjudged to be the ninth most unequal city in the UN\u2019s study of 120 cities \nworldwide, with race a major factor shaping inequality in US cities. It may be a small hope, but is \nnonetheless an important one, that a book such as Searching for the Just City might contribute not only \nto the awareness of, but the response to, such a condition. \nHarvey, D.
