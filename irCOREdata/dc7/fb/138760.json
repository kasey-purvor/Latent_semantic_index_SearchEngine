The demonstrated reproducibility and the simplicity and ease of use as well \nas the portability for in situ measurements, the biosensor could be suitable as a reliable initial \nwarning device for elevated BTE levels in indoor and outdoor environments.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere represent one of the \nmajor causes to the air quality deterioration and environmental pollution. Among these VOCs, \nbenzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX hereafter) are produced in huge amounts \nand are used in fuels, as solvents, and as starting materials for the production of plastics, \nsynthetic fibers, and pesticides (Budavari, 1996). At room temperature and atmospheric \npressure, these compounds are sufficiently vaporised to pose a significant health hazard to \nhumans (Fruscella William 2002). A large amount of BTEX is therefore released into the \natmosphere during manufacture, transportation, use, and disposal every year. BTEX vapors \nare corrosive and toxic substances and are on the EPA Priority Pollutant List (EPA, 1996), \nand in the top 100 chemicals on the Priority List of Hazardous Substances published by the \nAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR, 2003). Exposure to BTEX \nprimarily occurs via inhalation (WHO 2002); hence individuals working in industries \nproducing or using these petrochemicals are exposed to the highest levels of these toxic \naromatic hydrocarbons. Acute exposure to high levels of BTEX has been associated with skin \nand sensory irritation, central nervous system depression, and effects on the respiratory \nsystem. Prolonged exposure has similar effects and is additionally adversely affecting the \nkidney, liver and blood systems (Fruscella William 2002, Ozokwelu Dickson E. 2000, \nCannella William J. 2000). Due to the proven different degrees of toxicity, permissible \nexposure levels for each single BTEX-compound were established. The current European \npermissible exposure levels for benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene and xylenes are reported in \nTable 1. \nThe conventional method for monitoring human BTEX exposure in the workplace includes \nthe trapping of BTEX vapours on charcoal adsorption tubes, desorbtion with an appropriate \nsolvent (e.g. carbon disulfide) and subsequent determination of the VOCs employing gas \nchromatography (WHO 2002, Healt and Safety Executive 1997). Classical chromatographic \nmethods, such as GC-analysis, provide high accuracy and precision. These techniques \nhowever, are often time-consuming, require highly sophisticated equipment, are expensive, \nand are usually lab based. For the routinely performed detection of BTEX in air, alternative, \nfaster, more economical and portable in-situ detection devices, such as biosensors, would \ntherefore be desirable.  \nBiosensors incorporate a biological sensing element (e.g. microorganisms), which is either \nintimately connected to or integrated within a suitable transducing system (Turner A.P.F. e al. \n2000). The sensing element specifically recognises the species under investigation; the \ntransducer quantitatively converts the biochemical signal into an electronic signal that can be \nsuitably processed and converted to an output. Therefore, analytes may be detected by using \nthe assimilation capacity of the microorganism as an index of the respiration activity or of the \nmetabolic activity (Mulchandani A., Rogers K.R. 1998). Such microbial biosensors based on \nrespiratory activity have had several applications in environmental monitoring over the past \nyears (Tan H.M. e al. 1994, D\u2019Souza S.F. 2001). Recently, a FIA operated amperometric \nbacterial biosensor, based on Pseudomonas putida ML2, for detection of benzene in \nworkplace air was reported by Lanyon et al. (Lanyon Y.H. e al. 2004a, Lanyon Y.H. e al. \n2004b). This sensor was constructed by immobilising the bacterial cells between two cellulose \nacetate membranes, and subsequent fixation of the membranes onto an amperometric Clark \ntype dissolved oxygen electrode.  \nStarting from the reports by Lanyon et al. (Lanyon Y.H. e al. 2004a, Lanyon Y.H. e al. \n2004b), the applicability of an amperometric bacterial biosensor for the detection of the whole \nBTEX range in air was investigated in this work. The sensor was based on the same principles \nas the aforementioned benzene-sensor, but utilising a different bacterial strain, Pseudomonas \nputida F1.  \nPseudomonas putida F1 (PpF1) is a fluorescent soil bacterium that can assimilate toluene, \nbenzene, ethylbenzene, phenol, and other aromatics as sole carbon and energy sources \n(Gibson D.T. et al., 1968). Like other pseudomonads, many of its induced enzymes are \nnonspecific and its metabolic pathways contain a high degree of convergence allowing for the \nefficient utilization of a wide range of growth substrates (Hutchinson and Robinson, 1988). \nThe enzymic pathway responsible for converting these aromatic hydrocarbons to TCA cycle \nintermediates is called the toluene degradation (tod) pathway (Finette et al., 1984; Gibson et \nal., 1990). The tod pathway consists of several enzymic reactions; for example (see Scheme \n1), toluene is first transformed into cis-toluene dihydrodiol through the insertion of a molecule \nof oxygen catalyzed by a multicomponent toluene dioxygenase (Finette et al., 1984; Gibson et \nal., 1990; Yeh et al., 1977). cis-Toluene dihydrodiol is then dehydrogenated to form 3-\nmethylcatechol, which is cleaved at the meta position by insertion of a second dioxygen \nmolecule (Scheme 1). Then the reaction products are converted to tricarboxylic acid cycle \n(TCA cycle) intermediates (Lau et al., 1994; Zylstra and Gibson, 1989). \nBenzene, toluene and ethylbenzene can be degraded by P. putida F1 via the same pathway \n(Scheme 1). Further studies on the substrate specificity of the tod pathway have revealed that \nn-propylbenzene, n-butylbenzene, cumene and biphenyl are degraded to only ring-fission \ndead-end products whereas p-xylene is only converted to 2,6-dimethylcatechol, (Cho et al., \n2000; Gibson et al., 1974, Yu et al., 2001), revealing the limitations of the corresponding \nenzymes in channeling substrates into TCA cycle intermediates (Furukawa et al., 1993). \n \nScheme 1: Pseudomonas putida F1 catabolyc pathways for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene \nand p-xylene. \n \nDuring the aerobic assimilation of BTE, an increase in respiration rate and corresponding \noxygen consumption mainly due to the dioxygenases catalysis occurs and can be used as basis \nfor the detection of these VOCs in solution. Xylenes, the last member of the BTEX range, can \nso far not be degraded by this bacterial strain. However, Choi et al. (Choi E.N. e al. 2003) \nreported that the range of compounds which can be metabolised by Pseudomonas putida F1 \ncan possibly be expanded by cultivating the cells with different aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g \nxylenes) as growth-additives. Pre-existing metabolic pathways can be altered by natural \nadaptation of the tod-degradation pathway and hence, the novel metabolic capabilities of the \nbacterial cells might be subsequently exploited in a biosensor. A sensing device based on this \nprinciple might therefore be employed as an early warning device for the presence of toxic \nVOCs in air.  \n EXPERIMENTAL \n \nReagents \n \nBacterial culture constituents: Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and dipotassium \nhydrogen phosphate (K2HPO4) were purchased from Acros Organics (Fisher Scientific UK \nLtd, Loughborough). Tryptone and agar were purchased from Oxoid S.p.A. (Milan, Italy). \nMagnesium sulphate (MgSO4.7H2O) and iron sulphate (FeSO4.7H2O) were purchased from \nFluka (Milan, Italy). Ammonium sulphate (NH4)2SO4 and benzene were purchased from \nSigma (Milan, Italy).  \nBuffer components (KH2PO4 and K2HPO4.3H2O) and potassium chloride (KCl) used for the \nelectrolyte solution were purchased from Merck (Milan, Italy). \n \nBacterial strain and culture conditions.  \n \nP. putida F1 was maintained on agar plates containing a minimal medium (see below) and \nsupplied with toluene vapor (0.2 mmol liter-1). For the preparation of seed culture, a colony of \nP. putida F1 was inoculated into the same minimal medium supplied with toluene as the sole \ncarbon source and incubated overnight at 30\u00b0C following previous methodologies reported by \nLanyon (Lanyon Y.H. e al. 2004a). One litre of minimal medium contained the following \nconstituents: KH2PO4 (1.02g), K2HPO4 (3.06g), (NH4)2SO4 (1g), Tryptone (0.2g), \nMgSO4.7H2O (0.4g), and FeSO4.7H2O (0.04g). The bacterial cultures were incubated in an \nincubator shaker (Gerhardt Thermoshake, K\u00f6nigswinter, Germany) for 18 hours at 30\u00b0C and \n150 rpm to obtain cells in the stationary phase of growth. Sub-cultures of P.putida F1 were \nprepared on a monthly basis and preserved on minimal medium agar plates (same constituents \nas the liquid medium with the addition of 15g agar per litre).  \n Instrumentation \n \nAll experiments were conducted using a battery operated portable Idronaut Oxyliquid model \n23 dissolved oxygen probe and meter (Idronaut s.r.l., Brugherio (MI), Italy) as the transducer, \nand measuring device. An atmospheric air saturated potassium phosphate buffer (50mM, pH \n7) carrier stream was pumped through a custom-made flow cell (containing the dissolved \noxygen probe) using a peristaltic pump (Gilson Minipuls3, Gilson Medical Electronics, Paris, \nFrance). A Rheodyne model 7125 syringe loading sample injector (Rheodyne, CA, USA) was \nemployed to introduce standard or sample solutions into the carrier stream. All biosensor \nexperiments were performed at room temperature (25-30\u00b0C).  \n \nImmobilisation \n \nThe immobilisation was conducted according to the optimised procedure reported by Lanyon \net al. (Lanyon Y.H. e al. 2004b). P.putida F1 cells were harvested by centrifugation \n(Eppendorf, MiniSpin Plus) of 1 mL of an 18 h culture (2415 g, 10 min, room temperature). \nThe supernatant was discarded and the pellet (0.9 mg mean dry weight) was re-suspended in \n100 \u00b5L of potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7). The suspension was pipetted onto the \ncentre of a cellulose acetate membrane (13 mm diameter, 0.2 micron) (Sartorious, Antella \n(FI), Italy) which was placed on top of a filter flask. After the buffer had naturally filtered \nthrough, a second cellulose acetate membrane (25 mm diameter, 0.2 micron) was placed on \ntop of the first to sandwich the bacterial cells between the two membranes. The bacterial \nmembranes were subsequently transferred onto a gas permeable polyethylene membrane \n(approximately 30 mm x 30 mm), placed onto the cap of the dissolved oxygen probe and \nfixed using a rubber o-ring. Each bacterial membrane was used for as long as the sensitivity \nand reproducibility of the sensor response persisted. When no experiments were performed \nthe sensor (the cap of the dissolved oxygen probe with the immobilised bacterial cells fixed \nonto it) was stored at 4\u00b0C in a 1 mM benzene solution prepared in potassium phosphate buffer \n(50 mM, pH 7).  \n \nMeasurement Scheme \n \nThe endogenous respiration rate of the immobilised P. putida F1 cells is represented by the \nsteady state baseline of the oxygen meter. From the phosphate buffer dissolved oxygen \ndiffuses continuously through the dialysis membranes to the surface of the platinum working \nelectrode of the oxygen probe. The working electrode is kept at a fixed potential (-600 mV) \nagainst an Ag\/AgCl reference electrode, at which oxygen is reduced and a current is \nproduced. After the injection of benzene, the hydrocarbon diffuses through the membranes \nand is degraded by the immobilized bacteria causing an increase in their respiration rate and \noxygen consumption. Consequently, the concentration of dissolved oxygen near the surface of \nthe oxygen probe drops causing a decrease in the sensor output signal until a new steady state \nor \u201cpeak\u201d is obtained. The drop in concentration of dissolved oxygen and the corresponding \ndecrease in sensor signal are proportional to the concentration of benzene injected. All results \nare presented as percentage decrease from the original steady state baseline, Bx\/Bo (%), \nwhere: Bo is the original baseline and Bx is the secondary baseline or peak (Lanyon Y.H. e al. \n2004a, Lanyon Y.H. e al. 2004b). \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nPreliminary tests of the biosensor in batch mode revealed that it was possible to detect \nbenzene, toluene and ethylbenzene. No detectable responses for xylenes could be obtained \nalthough p-xylene was reported to be at converted to a dead-end product: 2,6-\ndimethylcatechol (Yu et al., 2001). These findings were in accordance with those reported by \nChoi et al. (Choi E.N. e al. 2003) and Gibson et al. (Gibson D.T. e al. 1968). Due to the \npromising results in batch mode, all subsequent experiments were performed in the beneficial \nkinetic (FIA) mode. The use of a FIA system with a bacterial biosensor brings forth different \nadvantages with respect to the batch system, including an increased simplicity of operation \nand a very accurate analysis of a greater number of samples over a given period (Lanyon Y.H. \ne al. 2004a). The sensitivity and reproducibility of the sensor response to different \nconcentrations of BTEX were examined to establish linear ranges and detection limits of the \nbiosensor. Furthermore, different parameters possibly affecting the sensor response were \ninvestigated and compared with results reported in the literature in order to optimise the \nperformance of the system. In these experiments, (i) effects of the solvent employed, (ii) \neffects of different flow rates and injection volumes, (iii) effects of membrane cell loadings, \n(iv) effects of different growth-additives, and (v) lifetime of the bacterial membranes were \ndetermined. \n \nEffect of N-, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) \n \nDue to the poor solubility of toluene, ethyl-benzene and xylenes in water, all BTEX stock \nsolutions had to be prepared in an organic solvent. The employed solvent had to be miscible \nwith the water-based sample carrier stream (potassium phosphate buffer) and did not interfere \nwith the biosensor response or the viability of the bacterial cells. The most compatible solvent \nfor use with a previously reported microbial biosensor for detection of benzene in workplace \nair was N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (Lanyon Y.H. e al. 2004b). DMF was also reported \nto be used as an alternative desorbtion solvent for the extraction of VOCs following the \nsampling of workplace air on charcoal tubes (Johansen I., Wendelboe J.F. 1981). Hence, such \na sample-eluent could be directly analysed with the biosensor to qualitatively and \nquantitatively determine the different VOCs sampled in air. Due to these beneficial properties, \nthe suitability of DMF as possible solvent for use with the BTEX sensor was investigated in \nthis work. Figure 1 shows the effects of increasing concentrations of DMF on the response of \nthe BTEX-biosensor. It was found that a concentration of 2% DMF did not cause a significant \ndecrease from the baseline. A similar maximum concentration of DMF was reported by \nLanyon et al. (Lanyon Y.H. e al. 2004b). A 2% concentration of DMF allowed 100 \u00b5L of \nBTEX stock solutions (BTEX in pure DMF) to be diluted in 5 mL of phosphate buffer; the \nvolume required to flush and fill a 1 mL injection loop of the FIA system.  \n \nEffect of Flow Rates and Injection Volumes \n \nIn order to achieve greatest sensitivity at reasonable fast response and baseline recovery \ntimes, different flow rates and injection volumes were investigated. In the literature a flow \nrate of 0.5 mL min-1 was reported to be optimum for the use with similar biosensing systems \n[1,16]. In this work, flow rates between 0.25 mL min-1 and 1 mL min-1 were investigated. In \nTable 1 a summary of the biosensor response to BTE (each 0.1 mM, a concentration which \ncaused a significant decrease from the baseline in batch mode) can be seen. At the lowest flow \nrate investigated (0.25 mL min-1), the highest sensitivities for benzene, toluene and \nethylbenzene were obtained. However, the increased sensitivity was always coupled with \nlonger response and base line recovery times. On the contrary, at the highest flow rate tested \n(1 mL min-1), low response and baseline recovery times could be obtained. However, the \nsensitivity of the biosensor to benzene and toluene was extremely low and it was impossible \nto detect ethylbenzene.  \nIn addition to flow rates, also the effect of different injection loop volumes was investigated. \nAccording to the literature, a 1 mL injection loop was reported to be the most advantageous \nvolume (Lanyon Y.H. e al. 2004a). Starting from this value, higher and lower injection \nvolumes were tested at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min-1 to determine the optimum injection loop \nvolume for the BTEX biosensor. A summary of the results obtained can be seen in Table 2. \nIncreasing the injection volume had similar effects on the biosensor response as decreasing \nthe flow rate and vice versa (results not displayed).  \nThe BTEX sensor showed the highest sensitivity to each BTEX compound at very low flow \nrates (1mL min-1) and high injection volumes (3mL). However, with the increasing sensitivity \nalso the response time and base line recovery time increased. Hence, a suitable balance was to \nbe found to assure sufficient sensitivity to be able to detect low concentrations of BTEX at \nreasonable response and baseline recovery times. Taking into account the results reported in \nthe literature (Lanyon Y.H. e al. 2004a, Lui J. e al. 2000) and the experimental results \nobtained, a flow rate of 0.5 mL min-1 and an injection volume of 1 mL were found to be the \nmost suitable operating condition s for the FIA system employed in this work. \n \nEffect of the Growth additive (Carbon Source) \n \nThe Aim of this investigation was to find out whether the different growth-additives influence \nthe sensitivity of the biosensor response to any of the BTEX compounds. Pseudomonas \nputida F1 cells were grown in the presence of benzene, toluene and ethyl benzene. In \naddition, the bacterial cells were grown in the presence of xylenes to establish if stable \nmutants with the ability to also degrade this VOC can be cultivated and the detection array of \nthe biosensor could possibly be expanded.  \nIn Table 4 the response of the biosensor to all BTEX compounds is summarised. A \nconcentration of 0.1 mM (a concentration which caused a significant response in the static \nmode) of each hydrocarbon was injected. It can be seen that the biosensor showed a response \nto benzene, toluene and ethylbenzene. No response could be obtained for xylenes when the \nbacterial cells were cultivated with BTE as growth additives. Regarding the sensitivity, \nresponse time and baseline recovery time one can see in Table 4 that there is no significant \ndifference if the cells are grown on benzene or toluene. If the bacteria were grown on \nethylbenzene, however, the performance of the biosensor was impaired (i.e. the sensitivity to \nBTE decreased and the baseline recovery time was longer). This decrease of sensitivity might \nbe due to the fact that the number of viable cells immobilised on the membrane is smaller if \ncells are grown in presence of ethylbenzene, indicating that there may have been a toxicity \neffect. Cell loading experiments with this culture revealed that if increasing volumes of \nculture aliquots were immobilised the sensitivity increased accordingly. The growth \nconditions for Pseudomonas putida F1 have been optimised for toluene and benzene as \ngrowth substrates [4] and toluene was reported to be the most common additive (\u00a7Gibson D.T. \ne al. 1968). In order to optimise the growth conditions for ethylbenzene, more work would be \nrequired to determine the growth curve in the presence of this hydrocarbon and to assess after \nwhich incubation time the optimum amount of viable cells can be obtained. In addition, the \nharvested cells were not stable and died over night; i.e. also the applied storage method (0.1 \nmM benzene-solution, 4\u00b0C) would have to be changed. As for benzene and toluene the \ngrowth conditions are well established and no significant advantages are expected if the \nbacteria are grown in the presence of ethylbenzene, cells for all other experiments were grown \nin the presence of toluene (10 mM) following procedures described by Choi et al. (Choi E.N. \ne al. 2003) and Lanyon et al. (Lanyon Y.H. e al. 2004a). \n \nEffect of Cell Loading \n \nThe response of a respiration activity-type microbial biosensor is strongly dependent on the \nnumber of viable cells immobilised on the membrane (Prescott L.M. e al. 1993. Higher cell \nloadings should therefore result in higher sensor sensitivities. Cell loadings (of bacterial cells \ngrown with toluene as carbon source) from 0.5 mg up to 2 mg (dry weight) were investigated \nand indeed it was found that the membrane with the highest cell loading showed the highest \nsensitivity to BTE (with a concentration of 0.1 mM each). However, the gas permeability \nthrough the microorganism-immobilized membrane has to be considered if an oxygen \nelectrode-based sensor is used (Karube Isao, Chang M.E.S.M. 1991). Lanyon et al. (Turner \nA.P.F. e al. 2000) as well as Mulchandani and Rogers (Mulchandani A., Rogers K.R. 1998) \nreported that too high cell loadings cause a high diffusion resistance, which results in a very \nlow signal. For the biosensor used in this work, bacterial pellet dry weights of more than 1.5 \nmg restricted the oxygen passage through the membrane and caused a decrease in sensor \nsensitivity. These findings are in accordance with those reported in the literature (Lanyon \nY.H. e al. 2004a, Im Lee J., Karube I. 1996).  \nApart from diffusion resistance, the stabilisation time (the time taken after immobilisation \nbefore the sensor is ready for use) also has to be considered in the construction of a bacterial \nbiosensor. The stabilisation time for the membrane showing the highest sensitivity in this \nwork (1.5 mg pellet dry weight) was around 3 hours, compared to only 0.5 hours for the \nmembrane with the lowest number of cells immobilised (0.5 mg pellet dry weight). As \nbiosensors are by definition rapid monitoring devices, a stabilisation time of 3 hours is \nunreasonable. Therefore, a sensible balance between sensitivity and stabilisation time needed \nto be found. Lanyon et al. (Lanyon Y.H. e al. 2004a) reported that a culture volume of 1 mL \n(0,9 mg pellet dry weight) was regarded to be optimal for the benzene biosensor. The same \npellet dry weight was found to be most advantageous also for the sensor investigated in this \nwork. Using a 1 mL immobilisation volume (0.9 mg pellet dry weight), the biosensor showed \na satisfying sensitivity to BTE (see Table at a reasonable stabilisation time (around 1 hour).   \n \nBTEX Linear Detection Ranges  \n \nAfter evaluating the optimum operating parameters of the biosensor, the linear detection range \nfor each single BTEX compound was determined. Utilising an immobilisation volume of 1 \nmL of bacterial culture, a flow rate of 0.5 mL min-1 and an injection volume of 1 mL linear \ndetection ranges between 0.01 - 0.16 mM benzene (slope y = -323x, R\u00b2 = 0.991), 0.04 \u2013 0.2 \nmM toluene (slope: y = -188x, R\u00b2 = 0.987) and 0.1 \u2013 0.2 mM ethylbenzene (slope: y = -82.5x, \nR\u00b2 = 0.994) were obtained. The sensor did not display response to xylenes. A summary of the \ncalibration curves for BTE is shown in Figure 1. A similar linear detection range for benzene \nwas reported in the literature for a sensor based on a different bacterial strain, Pseudomonas \nputida ML2 (Turner A.P.F. e al. 2000). The BTEX biosensor displays different sensitivities \n(Figure 1) response and baseline recovery times (Table 3) for benzene, toluene and \nethylbenzene. In a further experiment BTE were injected at the same time in different \nmixtures at different concentrations (results not displayed). Due to the differences in \nsensitivity, response and baseline recovery time, it was possible to determine which \ncompounds were present in the mixture by interpreting the different peak shapes displayed on \nthe chart recorder. Injection of benzene resulted in the greatest decrease from the original \nbaseline (due to the steepest slope with respect to toluene and ethylbenzene: y = 323x, R\u00b2 = \n0.991) with the steepest slopes of the peaks due to the fast response time (5 min) and base line \nrecovery time (15 min). A lesser decrease from the baseline was, with less steep slopes of the \npeaks was obtained when toluene (slope: y = -188x, response time: 8 min, base line recovery \ntime: 20 min) was injected. Ethylbenzene showed the least high peaks with the flattest slopes \n(slope: y = -82.5x, response time: 12 min, base line recovery time: 30 min). In addition to the \nqualitative properties of the biosensor, the sensor response (i.e. the decrease from the original \nbaseline) to the mixtures of BTE always equaled the sum of the sensor responses to each \nsingle compound.  \n \nStability and Reproducibility \n \nCulturing bacterial cells is a very time and material consuming process. Hence it is beneficial \nto prepare a bacterial membrane once and use it for as long as the sensor sensitivity and \nreproducibility persist. With the bacterial cells employed in this work good intra-assay \nreproducibility over one day of continuous use could be achieved In addition, the sensor \ndisplayed good inter-assay reproducibility. No decrease in sensitivity could be observed over \n2 weeks of continuous use. During the time when the sensor was not in use, the bacterial \nmembrane was stored at 4\u00b0C in the fridge in a 1mM benzene solution. As no decrease in \nsensor response occurred over the period of investigation; also the applied storage method \nproved to be efficient. Utilising the same storage method, Lanyon et al. (Lanyon Y.H. e al. \n2004a) reported that a reproducible sensor response was obtained over a period of 28 days. A \nsimilar storage method was also employed by Schmidt et al. (Schmidt A. e al. 1996), \nreporting a lifetime of 25 days, however, with a sensitivity loss of 70% within first 7 days of \nuse. Stable and reproducible readings over a period of 3 months were obtained by Tan et al. \n(Tan H.M. e al. 1994) with storage of the membrane (left on the oxygen probe) at room \ntemperature in a 1.35 mM substrate solution. However, these results did not prove to be \nreproducible, as Lanyon et al. (Lanyon Y.H. e al. 2004a) reported a significant decrease in \nsensor sensitivity after 3 days of use and storage under those conditions. Additionally, in the \nliterature (Lui J. e al. 2000) evidence can be found that storage at room temperature generally \ncauses similar decreases in sensor response. Apart from the storage conditions, also the \nfrequency of use of a bacterial membrane might influence its lifetime; numerous \nmeasurements have implied high stability, whereas a low analysis number and\/or long pauses \nin between implied low stability (Mulchandani A., Rogers K.R. 1998).  \n \nInterfering Compounds \n \nIn industry air, the BTEX compounds will usually occur in a mixture with various other \nVOCs. Hence, it was important to assess if the sensor was selective to BTE. According to the \nliterature (Choi E.N. e al. 2003), Pseudomonas putida F1, does not only degrade benzene, \ntoluene and ethyl-benzene, but also other aromatic hydrocarbons; e.g. different benzene \nderivates such as isopropyl benzene, see introduction). However, the oxidation rate and hence \nthe oxygen uptake under the current operation conditions of the biosensor are too low to cause \na significant decrease from the original baseline. Therefore, the sensor can be regarded as \nspecific to benzene, toluene and ethyl benzene.  \n \nCONCLUSION  \n \nThe experiments revealed that the bacterial strain, Pseudomonas putida F1, can be used as \nbiological element in a FIA operated amperometric biosensor for the detection of benzene, \ntoluene and ethylbenzene. No response for xylenes could be obtained and no stable clone \ncould be isolated after the cell culturing experiments employing xylenes as carbon sources. It \nwas found that all the optimised conditions (cell-culturing, construction, and FIA parameters) \nfor the previously developed amperometric benzene biosensor (Lanyon Y.H. e al. 2004a, \nLanyon Y.H. e al. 2004b) could be directly applied to this new biosensor yielding satisfactory \nresults regarding the sensitivity and reproducibility of the sensor. Furthermore, it was possible \nto distinguish single BTE compounds in mixtures, due to the significant differences in peak \nshapes. IF the FIA-system could be further automated and if appropriate software could be \ndeveloped for the system, it might also be possible to quantitatively differentiate between \nbenzene, toluene and ethyl benzene in mixtures as the sensor response to a mixture of BTE \nequaled the sum of the sensor responses to each single compound. If the sensor should be \noperated as an early warning device for the presence of BTEX in workplace air, future work \nshould initially focus on cultivating stable clones of Pseudomonas putida F1 that are able to \ndegrade xylenes in addition to BTE. The earlier described natural adaptation of the tod-\ndegradation pathway of P. putida F1 is possible. However, it is a very slow process and it \nmight be beneficial to try to introduce the additional metabolic capability of xylenes \ndegradation by genetic engineering techniques.  \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n \nATSDR.
