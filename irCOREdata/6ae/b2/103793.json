It is preliminary in that it \naddresses the constitutional and legislative frameworks in relation to academic freedom, \nthereby establishing the basis for subsequent empirical work to examine how the concept is \ninterpreted and perceived by academic staff within their day to day work within Europe\u2019s \nUniversities. The study\u2019s rationale is as follows. Firstly, academic freedom is considered \nimportant to the implementation of the Bologna Process. As the Salamanca Declaration of \n2001 indicated, progress on the Bologna Process requires that \u2018European universities be \nempowered to act in line with the guiding principle of autonomy with accountability ... (and) \n... confirm their adhesion to the principles of the Magna Charta Universitatum of 1988 and, in \nparticular, academic freedom\u2019 (EUA, 2001, 1). Clearly, when academic freedom varies \nbetween nation states, the likelihood of mobility is reduced \u2013 staff and students are unlikely to \ndesire to work or study in another university in which the academic freedom afforded to them \np.1 \nis significantly lower than in their home institution. The Magna Charta Universitarum (EUA, \n1988, 2) states: \u2018Freedom in research and training is the fundamental principle of university \nlife, and governments and universities, each as far as in them lies, must ensure respect for this \nfundamental requirement\u2019 and, in a like vein, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the \nEuropean Union declaims in Article 13 that \u2018The arts and scientific research shall be free of \nconstraint. Academic freedom shall be respected\u2019 (E.U., 2000, 11). However, neither of these \ndocuments provides any guidance as to what constitutes academic freedom, how it may be \nprotected or nurtured, and whether therefore the presence (or absence) of academic freedom is \nsupporting (or hindering) the implementation of the Bologna Process.  \nSecondly, despite the absence of a clear definition, it has nevertheless been asserted that \nacademic freedom is under threat from the growth in the use of new information and \ncommunication technologies to deliver open and distance learning through cross national \ncollaboration, which means that an academic could be located within a state in which \nacademic freedom is protected yet providing a degree course in a country in which academic \nfreedom is absent. Additionally, many such online courses are provided as a profitable service \nrather than a public good and, as Lieberwitz\u2019s study discovered, examination of these for-\nprofit courses shows that \u2018they are not supportable on the grounds presented and that they \nundermine the basic principles of academic freedom and the independence of faculty ... \n(hence) ... arguments promoting the for-profit corporation require closer examination ... The \nassurances that academic freedom will be protected are illusory\u2019 (Lieberwitz, 2002, 115). \nHence it is difficult to disagree with Altbach\u2019s prognosis that \u2018Academic freedom needs to be \nreconsidered in the era of the Internet\u2019 (Altbach, 2001, 208). \nThirdly, it has been asserted that academic freedom is threatened by the rising trend of \nmanagerialism in higher education. In his essay on The Interpretation of the Magna Charta \nUniversitatum and its Principles, Lay (2004, 86) notes that \u2018the organisational structures of \nmany universities have been gradually reformed away from a collegial and towards a more \ncorporate model\u2019 and Rochford finds that \u2018The motivation for this shift has been a concern \nabout the ability of the traditional collegiate structure to manage effectively\u2019 (Rochford, 2003, \n252f). This shift has been endorsed by national governments, often acting on, and prompted \nby, the findings of national committees of inquiry. The Attali Report in France, the Bricall \nReport in Spain, and the Dearing Report in the U.K. all recommended a shift in governance in \nhigher education towards less collegial and more corporate management structures. Assessing \nsuch trends, Standler (2000, 4), rightly comments that \u2018As in other areas of life, more \nmanagement and control means less freedom. It is the same in the university. Surprisingly, \np.2 \nscholarly articles on \u201cacademic freedom\u201d rarely mention freedom from management as an \nimportant feature of academic freedom.\u2019 Among the dangers resulting from such trends, \nTierney warns that \u2018If deans and departmental heads, for example, are seen exclusively as \nmanagers, a culture will be developed where academic freedom is irrelevant and may not even \nbe discussed\u2019 (Tierney, 2001, 13). \nThe final rationale for the study is that there is a dearth of quantitative analyses of \nacademic freedom, generally, and more especially within a European context. Hence \u00c5kerlind \nand Kayrooz opine that \u2018To date, public debates and scholarly discussions about the nature of \nacademic freedom have been marked by a lack of empirical data\u2019 (\u00c5kerlind and Kayrooz, \n2002, 330). This view is endorsed by Rothblatt who comments that \u2018We do not as yet have a \nsystematic historical analysis of the development of academic freedom conceptions and \npractices, especially one which allows us to compare periods, countries and systems\u2019 \n(Rothblatt, 1991, 21). Additionally, but more caustically, Standler states \u2018There is a large \nliterature on academic freedom, mostly written by professors, and mostly consisting of self-\nserving praise and unsupported assertions\u2019 (Standler, 2000, 18). More helpful, perhaps, is \nStuller\u2019s exhortation that \u2018Academic freedom is of unquestioned importance and it comes in \nmany forms. \u2026 In the spirit of inquiry then, courts and scholars alike should resolve that \nwhen they speak of academic freedom they will define their terms, ask the difficult questions \nand follow the argument where it leads\u2019 (Stuller, 1998, 342f). \nMeasuring the Parameters of Academic Freedom \nIn attempting to measure the parameters of academic freedom, there are three preliminary \nquestions to be addressed. First, what parameters should be used? Answering this question is \ndifficult as the principles and practice of academic freedom may vary between different \nnations. For example, in some nations universities and their staff may be anxious to protect \nthe personal academic freedom of staff for teaching and research, but may be relatively \nunconcerned about the institutional freedom of the university in respect to its internal \nmanagement and autonomy. In the absence of an agreed definition of academic freedom \nwithin the E.U., the \u2018Recommendations concerning the Status of Higher-Education Teaching \nPersonnel\u2019 (UNESCO, 1997), produced by the International Association of Universities for \nUNESCO in 1997 were utilised, along with the substantial literature on academic freedom, to \nderive five different parameters which are considered to be important constituents of \nacademic freedom. \np.3 \nSecondly, how can the relative importance of these parameters be assessed? For example, \ndoes the inclusion of academic freedom within a nation\u2019s constitution provide better \nprotection of academic freedom than inclusion within specific national legislation? Similarly, \nis academic tenure more important to the preservation of academic freedom than institutional \nself governance? Such qualitative questions can only really be addressed by asking the \nacademic staff themselves, which is outside the purview of this analysis, although this study is \nable to provide some preliminary answers which would usefully guide such empirical \nresearch in the future. For this reason, in the absence of data as to the relative importance of \nvarious parameters of academic freedom, this study will assume that all such parameters are \nequally important.  \nThirdly, how can these parameters be measured? Measurement is important in order to \ndetermine in which countries academic freedom is the strongest (in order to identify best \npractice) and weakest (in order to introduce measures so that an acceptable level of academic \nfreedom is enjoyed in all universities in the E.U.). However, applying cardinal values to (for \nexample) the constitutional protections for academic freedom may be impossible, although \nclearly some form of ordinal ranking may be feasible \u2013 for example, where one nation seeks \nto protect academic freedom by including it in the nation\u2019s constitution, while another does \nnot. For this reason, it was decided to rank the parameters in generic terms of whether they \nafforded low, medium or high protection for academic freedom. \nIn order to assess the differing levels of legal protection for academic freedom within the \nEuropean Union, data was gathered from 23 of the (then) 25 nations on both constitutional \nprotections for, and specific legislation relating to, freedom of speech, academic freedom, \ninstitutional governance, the appointment of the Rector and academic tenure. Cyprus was \nexcluded as part of it is controlled by Turkey, which is currently outside the E.U., and it \nproved impossible to get definitive information for the Belgian Communities. Gathering data \non the constitutions of the nations was comparatively easy, as the importance of these \ndocuments is such that English translations freely exist. By contrast, English versions of less \nwell known legislation on higher education are not readily available and, moreover, such laws \nare subject to periodic amendments as the systems of higher education in Europe evolve to \nmeet new challenges. In addition, some states (for example, Poland and Portugal) have private \nuniversities, and although these are normally small in number, legislation may be passed \nspecifically for them which may differ from the legislation enacted for publicly funded state \nuniversities. Consequently as Kwiek (2003), for example, reports, the situation in the private \nhigher education institutions may be different from that in the publicly funded institutions. \np.4 \nMoreover, in nations with federal constitutions, legislation protecting academic freedom \nwithin higher education may be passed at state, rather than federal level. Consequently, the \ninformation on individual member states provided in the tables represents a best estimate of \ncurrent legislation as applied to public universities, rather than a definitive statement covering \nall higher education institutions.  \nTurning first to constitutional protection, data was gathered on the elements of the \nconstitutions of the E.U. nations that relate to freedom of speech and academic freedom. This \nmeasure was used because the Constitution is the most important legal document within \nnation states and, moreover, there is an evident linkage between academic freedom and \nfreedom of speech \u2013 as Connolly observes \u2018academic freedom is a kind of cousin of freedom \nof speech\u2019 (Connolly, 2000, 71). Consequently, Daughtrey (1990, 267) argues that \u2018The free \nspeech guarantee serves as the basis of the concept of academic freedom,\u2019 an opinion shared \nby Turner (1988, 106) who believes that \u2018If academic freedom is not simple freedom of \nspeech, it is an extension of the principle of free speech which is an essential prerequisite for \nthe proper performance of the profession.\u2019 \nAll the 23 nation states, except the United Kingdom (which does not have a written \nconstitution), have some protection for freedom of speech enshrined in their constitutional \ndocuments, although the Netherlands Constitution does not explicitly mention freedom of \nexpression, but instead states that prior permission is not required before publication. By \ncontrast, the law in the U.K. places legal restrictions on the freedom of expression, and \nanything not covered by these restrictions is deemed lawful. Although all states, bar one, have \nsome form of constitutional protection for freedom of expression, eight have some caveats \nrelating to the exercise of that freedom. The constitutions in four states indicate that freedom \nof speech is guaranteed, subject only to the repression of offences committed in the exercise \nof these freedoms. The remaining four states place limitations on freedom of speech on the \ngeneral grounds of obscenity and indecency, the protection of children and young people, \nblasphemy, sedition, public order, incitement, insurrection, etc., while three mention specific \nrestrictions in relation to an insult against the President, the right to personal honour and the \ndisclosure of the capability of the armed forces. It would, therefore, be possible to conceive of \nsituations when academic freedom could be circumscribed by these restrictions on freedom of \nspeech, although such instances are likely to be small in number. \nAlthough Smith\u2019s research revealed that \u2018Explicit protection of this (academic) freedom \nin a Bill of Rights is unusual\u2019 (Smith, 1995, 678), in thirteen E.U. nations academic freedom \n(freedom of scientific research and the arts and of teaching) is considered sufficiently \np.5 \nimportant to be included in the constitution, although in Germany and Greece this freedom \nhas limits, in that academic freedom and the freedom to teach do not override allegiance to (or \nthe duty to obey) the Constitution. Furthermore, the constitution in eight countries guarantees \nthe autonomy or self governance of higher education institutions, although in all but two \nstates, this autonomy is exercised within the limits prescribed by specific higher education \nlaws. In Estonia, Finland, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, and Slovenia the Constitution guarantees \nboth the freedom of teaching and research and also the autonomy of universities. \nClearly in those nations where the constitution mentions both freedom of speech and \nacademic freedom (and explicitly details the freedom for teaching and research and \ninstitutional autonomy), protection for the principle of academic freedom is likely to be \nstronger than in those states where limitations are imposed or where only freedom of speech \nis mentioned, and in which protection for academic freedom may lie by reference to the \ninterpretation of constitutional freedom of speech protection, a situation which occurs, for \nexample, in the USA. Furthermore, in states where the constitution mentions neither academic \nfreedom nor freedom of speech, the degree of constitutional protection for the principle of \nacademic freedom is correspondingly low (if not non existent). On this basis, the degree of \nprotection for academic freedom within the constitution was allocated the values of high, \nmedium or low. Space does not permit inclusion of the full set of results (copies of which can \nbe obtained on request from the author), however Table 1 contains illustrative examples \ndemonstrating the approach taken.  \nThe full set of results, from which the entries in table 1 are drawn, was used to create \ntable 2, which indicates that a high level of protection for academic freedom exists in thirteen \nnations, a low level in two, with the remainder enjoying medium levels of protection. \nTable 1 Constitutional protection for freedom of speech and academic freedom \u2013 examples \n \nState\/Level of \nProtection Constitutional Statement on Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expressions \nLuxembourg \nMedium \nConstitution adopted 17 Oct 1868 \nArticle 24 [Expression]: Freedom of speech in all matters and freedom of the press is \nguaranteed, subject to the repression of offences committed in the exercise of these freedoms. \nTable 2 Constitutional protection for freedom of speech and academic freedom - summary \nNetherlands \nLow \nThe Netherlands Constitution 2002  \nArticle 71. No one shall require prior permission to publish thoughts or opinions through the \npress, without prejudice to the responsibility of every person under the law. \nSpain \nHigh \nConstitution of 29 Dec 1978 Article 20 [Specific Freedoms, Restrictions]  \nThe following rights are recognized and protected: a) To express and disseminate thoughts \nfreely through words, writing, or any other means of reproduction; b) Literary, artistic, \nscientific, and technical production, and creation; c) Academic freedom. \nArticle 27 [Education](10) The autonomy of universities is recognized under the terms \nestablished by law \n \n \np.6 \nTable 2 Constitutional protection for freedom of speech and academic freedom - summary \n \nNation Level of Protection Nation Level of Protection \nAustria High Lithuania High \nCzech Republic High Luxembourg Medium \nDenmark Medium Malta Medium \nEstonia High Netherlands Low \nFinland High Poland High \nFrance Medium Portugal High \nGermany Medium Slovakia High \nGreece Medium Slovenia High \nHungary High Spain High \nIreland Medium Sweden Medium \nItaly High U.K. N\/A \nLatvia High   \n \nThis initial analysis revealed that nearly half the E.U. states do not have protection for \nacademic freedom and university autonomy written into their constitution. However, although \nprotection for academic freedom may not be available under constitutional law, it may still be \nprotected in other national legislation. Hence information on the national legislative \ninstruments which relate to academic freedom and the protection of university autonomy was \ngathered. This demonstrated that, with the exception of Greece and Malta, all E.U. nations \nhave some specific legislation relating to higher education which refers to academic freedom \nand\/or university autonomy. However, the coverage and the detail vary considerably. For \nexample, legislation in the Czech Republic, Ireland, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and \nSpain is more explicit than in other states, and specifies protection for academic freedom for \nteaching and research, and institutional autonomy. Legislation in Austria, France, Germany, \nHungary, Italy, and Luxembourg, specifies freedom of teaching and research, but does not \nmention institutional autonomy. Of the remainder, some such as Lithuania mention academic \nfreedom or autonomy, which, as in the case of Lithuania, is established by law and the statutes \nof the universities, while some nations just have a brief general statement \u2013 as in the case of \nthe Netherlands where the law states that \u2018Academic freedom shall be respected within the \ninstitutions.\u2019 Interestingly, in Austria, not only does the legislation protect academic freedom, \nit also provides that individual academics cannot be forced to participate in academic work \nwhich conflicts with his\/her conscience.  \nApplying comparative values to the protection offered by national legislation is difficult. \nHowever, logic dictates that academic freedom is likely to be better protected where reference \nto it is most explicit in law. Hence in nations like Greece where there is no legislation, and the \nNetherlands and Italy (in which short generalised statements are made), the protection of \nacademic freedom by legislation will be lower than in countries like France, Latvia, and \nSlovenia, where detailed legislation ensures that the level of protection of academic freedom \np.7 \nis high. For those nations occupying the middle ground between these extremes, a description \nof medium protection is most appropriate. On this basis, the degree of protection for academic \nfreedom afforded by specific national legislation was allocated the values of high, medium or \nlow.  Table 3 below provides examples of some of the legislative instruments, and the scores \nascribed to them. \nTable 3 Specific legislation on academic freedom - examples \n \nState\/Level of \nProtection Specific legislation on academic freedom \nCzech Republic \nHigh \nAct on Higher Education Institutions No. 121\/2004 : Article 4  The following academic \nliberties and rights are guaranteed at higher education institutions: a) Freedom of science, \nresearch and artistic activities as well as making the results public; b) Freedom of instruction, \nnamely its openness to variety of scholastic theories, scientific and research methods and \nartistic trends; c) The right of learning that includes free choice of study specialisation within \nthe framework of study programmes as well as freedom of expressing one\u2019s opinion during \nlecturing; d) The right of academic community members to elect their representative \nacademic bodies; \nPoland \nMedium \nHigher Education Law 2005: Article 4: 1. Institutions of higher education shall be \nautonomous in all areas of their operation, subject to provisions herein. 2. In their operations, \ninstitutions of higher education shall be guided by principles of freedom of teaching, freedom \nof scientific research and freedom of artistic creation. \nU.K. \nLow \nEducation Reform Act 1988 Part II - Higher and Further Education Section 202 (1) There \nshall be a body of Commissioners known as the University Commissioners who shall \nexercise, in accordance with subsection (2) below, in relation to qualifying institutions, the \nfunctions assigned to them by those sections. (2) In exercising those functions, the \nCommissioners shall have regard to the need (a) to ensure that academic staff have freedom \nwithin the law to question and test received wisdom, and to put forward new ideas and \ncontroversial or unpopular opinions, without placing themselves in jeopardy of losing their \njobs or privileges they may have at their institutions; (b) to enable qualifying institutions to \nprovide education, promote learning and engage in research efficiently and economically; and \n(c) to apply the principles of justice and fairness. \n \nIt must be recognised that such a limited analysis is a discriminatory rather than objective \nexercise, providing at best probabilistic descriptions. However, such caveats notwithstanding, \napplying this process to all nation states produces the results shown in Table 4 below, which \ndemonstrates that national legislation offers a high level of protection for academic freedom \nin eleven states, a low level in six, with the remainder enjoying medium levels of protection. \nTable 4 Specific legislation protecting academic freedom - summary \n \nNation Level of Protection Nation Level of Protection \nAustria Medium Lithuania High \nCzech Republic High Luxembourg Medium \nDenmark Medium Malta Low \nEstonia Medium Netherlands Low \nFinland High Poland Medium \nFrance High Portugal Medium \nGermany High Slovakia High \nGreece N\/A Slovenia High \nHungary High Spain High \nIreland High Sweden Low \nItaly Low U.K. Low \nLatvia High   \n \np.8 \nThe situation in the U.K. constitutes a special case. Ostensibly the legislation enacted in \n1988 provides protection for academic freedom, but its intention was to weaken rather than \nstrengthen academic freedom, by removing tenure from academic staff. The bill applied only \nto academic staff appointed after November 20, 1987. Those appointed before that date were \nexempt from the Act, which was not extended to short-term contract research scientists or to \nmost academic related staff. Similarly, the old polytechnics which were granted university \nstatus in 1992 were exempt, as their academic staff did not have tenure. That the primary \nintention of the legislation was not the protection of academic freedom was made clear when \nthe Bill was introduced by the Minister, Kenneth Baker, who stated in Parliament that: \u2018In the \ncase of universities, the Government's policy is that newly appointed staff should no longer be \ngiven \u201ctenure\u201d, that is, special protection against dismissal on grounds of redundancy or \nfinancial exigency. The Bill provides (Clause 132) that staff currently in post who have tenure \nshould retain it as long as they continue in their present appointments, but that those newly \nappointed or promoted to permanent posts after 20 November 1987 should no longer have this \nspecial protection\u2019 (HC Deb, 1987, cc771-81). Hence it is difficult to disagree with Court\u2019s \nopinion that \u2018Although the 1988 Act made specific reference to the protection of academic \nfreedom, there must be doubt that staff engaged now in teaching and research at U.K. \nuniversities have the same liberty that existed in earlier times\u2019 (Court, 1998, 774). \nExamination of the data in tables 2 and 4 reveals that the overwhelming majority of E.U. \nnations have both constitutional protection of freedom of speech and\/academic freedom, \nallied to protection under specific legislation for universities. The aberrant case is the U.K. \nwhere there is no constitutional support for either freedom of speech or academic freedom, \nand the specific legislation was designed not to protect academic freedom, but as a \nsupplementary clause guaranteeing \u201cjust cause\u201d for the termination of academic employment, \nin a bill created to abolish tenure. This situation has lead Pritchard to argue that \u2018In the United \nKingdom, the absence of a written Constitution \u2026 has weakened British universities\u2019 \nattempts to defend themselves\u2019 (Pritchard, 1998, 121). This exception aside, the general \nconstitutional and legislative prominence accorded to academic freedom suggests that the \nmajority of E.U. nations regard the principle to be of cardinal importance, not only to \nuniversities but more generally to everyday life and the working of the state. Additionally, the \nnations formerly under the influence of the USSR, and which have joined the E.U. most \nrecently, as a group seem to ascribe more importance to academic freedom. This confirms \nThorens\u2019 observation that \u2018In the last few years \u2014 and this shows the pertinence of this issue \n\u2014 many countries emerging from authoritarian regimes have foreseen academic freedom in \np.9 \ntheir laws on higher education and more especially in those that concern universities\u2019 \n(Thorens, 2006, 91).  \nThe third parameter of academic freedom chosen for analysis is institutional autonomy \nand the internal governance of the university. In justification of the inclusion of this \nparameter, the UNESCO recommendations state that \u2018The proper enjoyment of academic \nfreedom \u2026 require(s) the autonomy of institutions of higher education. Autonomy is that \ndegree of self-governance necessary for effective decision making by institutions of higher \neducation regarding their academic work, standards, management and related activities \u2026 and \nrespect for academic freedom and human rights. Autonomy is the institutional form of \nacademic freedom \u2026 Higher education teaching personnel should have the right and \nopportunity, \u2026 to take part in the governing bodies and \u2026 they should also have the right to \nelect a majority of representatives to academic bodies within the higher education institution\u2019 \n(UNESCO, 1997, 28). These recommendations, although worthy, lack clarity. As Bricall \npoints out, \u2018University autonomy needs to be distinguished from concepts it is often confused \nwith, such as university self-management, collegial governance or academic freedom. \u2026 An \nacademic entity can be autonomous even if its internal decision making is not based on self-\nmanagement procedures\u2019 (Bricall, 2003, 59). Similarly, Berdahl makes the distinction \nbetween procedural autonomy, which is the power of the university to determine \u2018the means \nby which its goals and programmes will be pursued--the how of academe\u2019 and substantive \nautonomy, which is the power of the university to determine \u2018its own goals and programmes--\nif you will, the what of academe\u2019 (Berdahl, 1990, 174). In recent years governments in some \nE.U. states have given universities greater autonomy at institutional level, however as Lay \n(2004, 87) points out \u2018The collegial nature of traditional university organisation seems \nincreasingly halcyon when contrasted with the harsh present-day reality of university staff \nbeing viewed as little more than production line workers on the knowledge-factory floor. \u2026 \nThat they have been excluded from the decisions that control the development of the modern \nuniversity makes the concept of institutional autonomy appear increasingly hollow.\u2019 \nMoreover, as Rothblatt (1999, 17) emphasises \u2018institutional autonomy is not a guarantee of \nacademic freedom. The institution itself, \u2026 can inhibit or surpass academic freedom,\u2019 an \nopinion finding empirical endorsement in Anderson and Johnson\u2019s study of university \nautonomy in 20 countries which concluded that \u2018Institutional autonomy is a necessary but not \na sufficient condition for academic freedom\u2019 (Anderson and Johnson, 1998, 8). \nOn the basis of these arguments, the decision was taken to focus on self governance \nrather than institutional autonomy. This methodological decision has strong support from \np.10 \nexperts and institutions alike within the existing literature. For example the Association of \nAmerican University Professors argues that \u2018sound governance practise and the exercise of \nacademic freedom are closely connected, if not inextricably linked\u2019 (AAUP, 1994, 3), and \nthat \u2018the faculty\u2019s role in governance, is the foundation of academic freedom\u2019 (Scott, 1994, \n119). Similarly, Rochford has noted that \u2018A traditional institutional protection for academic \nfreedoms is through the tradition of participation by faculty members in academic \ngovernance\u2019 (Rochford, 2003, 252). More pertinently, perhaps, commentators have noted the \nrise in managerialism, accompanied by a decline in democratic participation by faculty, and \nlinked this to a weakening of academic freedom. As McMaster points out: \u2018Universities have \nalways been managed: the guilds of scholars that made up the first universities were \nthemselves hierarchies of authority. The main difference is that authority in current \noperational models of universities is seen to be related to managerial position and not to \nexpertise within a discipline\u2019 (McMaster, 2002, 3). More bluntly, Nyborg describes the \n\u2018situation in which the permanent academic staff no longer holds the majority of votes on the \ngoverning body\u2019 as \u2018a significant departure from traditional European practice with \nconsiderable implications for higher education governance\u2019 (Nyborg, 2003, 3). Such trends \nlead Gerber to state that \u2018in the context of today\u2019s misguided efforts to apply what is already a \ndiscredited corporate model of management to higher education, shared governance is taking \non new importance as a means of trying to preserve the ideals of liberal education that are \nnecessary for the continued vitality of our democratic society\u2019 (Gerber, 2002, 23). \nFor this part of the study, data was gathered on legislation relating to University \ngovernance. In attempting to measure self-governance, where the supreme decision making \nbody has a majority of faculty members, then the level of protection for the personal academic \nfreedom of staff is likely to be high; conversely where this body excludes academic staff or \nhas a majority of external members, then the level of protection will be low. Between these \ntwo positions will be a variety of governance models in which both the academic staff and \nexternal representatives have a significant voice but, owing to the presence of other \nrepresented groups (administrative staff, students, etc.), neither has a monopoly of decision \nmaking power. In such situations the level of protection for academic freedom will depend on \nthe ability of faculty to persuade other actors, within the process of governance, of the \nimportance of academic freedom. Despite such problems, it was possible to allocate the \ndescriptors (high, medium, low) to the systems of governance, and table 5 below gives some \nexamples as to how this was done. \n \np.11 \nTable 5 Legislation on university governance \u2013 examples \n \nState\/Level of \nProtection Legislation on university governance \nLithuania \nHigh \nLaw On Higher Education 21 March 2000 No.Viii-1586.

The governing body shall issue \nmore precise regulations relating to election procedures. The students shall be entitled to \nrepresentation on the governing body by three members. \n \nThe data demonstrated that the systems of university governance (and the participatory \nrole of academic staff) vary considerable within the EU. For example, in countries such as \nPoland, the Senate is the supreme decision making body of the university, and Professors, or \nstaff holding a doctoral degree, must comprise more than half the Senate members. By \np.12 \ncontrast, in the Netherlands the Executive Board is charged with governing the university in \nits entirety and is appointed by the Supervisory Board, the members of which are all \nappointed and dismissed by the Minister. In some states the system of governance is \ncomplicated - many have a bi- or tri cameral system, involving, for example as in Portugal, \nthe Senate, the University Assembly and the Administrative Council or as in Spain, the Social \nCouncil, the Council of Government and the University Senate. In other states the regulations \nspecify minimum and maximum figures for participation. For example, in Ireland, the \ngoverning authority includes the chief officer, a person appointed as the chairperson, at least \none but not more than two senior officers with responsibilities to the chief officer for \nacademic, financial or administrative affairs, between 2 and 6 Professorial elected \nrepresentatives, between 3 and 5 elected representatives from the other academic staff, \nbetween 1 and 3 representatives elected by the non-academic staff, between 2 and 3 elected \nofficers from the Students Union and one representative elected by the post-graduate students. \nClearly, where the academic staff enjoy their maximum allocation of representatives on the \ngoverning body, they will be in a more powerful position than if they are given their \nminimum allocation. Table 6 below summarises the findings and shows that, in thirteen states, \nthe system of governance offers high protection for academic freedom, in five states the level \nof possible protection is low, with five states in the intermediary category. \nTable 6 Legislation on university governance \u2013 summary \n \nNation Level of Protection Nation Level of Protection \nAustria High Lithuania High \nCzech Republic High Luxembourg Medium \nDenmark Low Malta Medium \nEstonia High Netherlands Low \nFinland High Poland High \nFrance Medium Portugal Medium \nGermany High Slovakia High \nGreece Medium Slovenia High \nHungary High Spain High \nIreland Low Sweden Low \nItaly High U.K. Low \nLatvia High   \n \nThe fourth measure chosen for inclusion in the study is the method of appointment of the \nUniversity Rector. This is not mentioned explicitly in the UNESCO recommendations, which \nnevertheless state that \u2018Autonomy should not be used by higher education institutions as a \npretext to limit the rights of higher-education teaching personnel\u2019 and that \u2018Higher-education \nteaching personnel should have the right and opportunity, without discrimination of any kind, \n\u2026 to criticize the functioning of higher education institutions, including their own\u2019 \n(UNESCO, 1997, 30). However as Standler notes \u2018A significant part of individual academic \np.13 \nfreedom is not a legal concept, but dependent on the internal culture among faculty and \nmanagement (e.g. Department Chairmen, Deans, the Chancellor, and their administrative \nstaff) at a university\u2019 (Standler, 2000, 3). In the past the Rectors were internal appointments, \nand saw part of their job as protecting the academic freedom of faculty. Thus Dodds (an ex-\nuniversity president) opines \u2018I know no college or university president for whom academic \nfreedom is not a recurring source of concern. As chief executive of his institution he bears the \nbrunt of criticisms and attacks by individuals and organizations, often inflamed by \nsuperpatriotism or anti-intellectual prejudices and fixations. \u2026 In line of duty a president \nrepeatedly defends the right of the faculty to express opinions and take action in areas over \nwhich he exercises no controls\u2019 (Dodds, 1963, 602). \nHowever, the appointment process of Rectors in many E.U. nations is changing, leading \nNyborg to note a trend away from the traditional model of institutional governance in which \n\u2018the academic community elects its own officers (rector, deans, university and faculty senates) \nwith little or no outside interference\u2019 to institutions hiring \u2018leaders from outside the academic \ncommunity, to replace the elected rector still found at the vast majority of higher education \ninstitutions\u2019 (Nyborg, 2003, 3). White\u2019s examination of case studies showed that \u2018Presidents, \ntrustees, and other powerful people who were opposed to the expression of unorthodox views \nand willing to use their power to suppress such expression could repeatedly threaten academic \nfreedom\u2019 (White, 2000, 61). Similarly Tierney (2001, 4) details cases in Australia where \n(inter alia) an emeritus professor who criticised a proposed policy received a letter from the \nVice Chancellor telling him to vacate his office (and position) for being discourteous. While \nRaelin reports that in 1991, after three philosophy lecturers at Swansea University in the U.K. \ncriticized the academic standards of a new degree program, two were suspended from \nteaching and one resigned, leading the (then) Vice Chancellor to comment that in the business \nworld \u2018those people ... would have been up the road the moment they kicked up the fuss\u2019 \n(Raelin, 2003, 42). \nClearly, where the Rector is chosen from the Faculty, by the Faculty, for a limited period \nin office, s\/he is unlikely to take decisions which undermine the academic freedom of the \nstaff, as s\/he knows that at the end her\/his term of office, someone else could be elected as \nRector and take retaliatory actions against her\/him. In such situations the level of protection \nfor academic freedom will be high. By contrast, where the Rector is chosen from outside the \nuniversity, and appointed for an indefinite term by an external agency, s\/he will be in a \nposition to abuse academic freedom, more especially where the faculty staff do not have the \nprotection of tenure. In such situations the level of protection of academic freedom is low. In \np.14 \nbetween these extremes will be different appointment procedures in which the academic staff \ncan have a significant but not a determinant effect on the outcome. For example, the staff may \nbe required to elect the Rector but from a shortlist drawn up externally, and without a right of \nveto or the ability to field their own preferred candidate. In such circumstances, the protection \nfor academic freedom is likely to be only moderate.  Table 7 gives some examples of how the \ndescriptions of high, medium or low, were allocated in accordance with the analysis above. \nTable 7 Legislation on the appointment of the rector - examples \n \nState\/Level of \nProtection Legislation on the appointment of the rector \nDenmark \nLow \nAct on Universities May 28 2003 \n10.(7) The Board shall employ and dismiss the Rector. \n12 (2): The Board shall be composed of external members and members representing the \nacademic staff of the university, which includes PhD students with university contracts, the \ntechnical and administrative staff and the students. The Board shall comprise a majority of \nexternal members. The Board shall elect a chair from among its external members. \n14. (2) The Rector shall be an acknowledged researcher within one of the university\u2019s \nacademic fields and have knowledge of the educational sector. [The appointment is \nadvertised externally, the length of appointment varies, but five years plus an extension of an \nadditional three is usual] \nEstonia \nMedium \nUniversities Act (Passed 12 January 1995, consolidated text May 2004) \nSection 17 Rector (1) A Rector shall be elected for five years pursuant to the procedure \nprescribed by the statutes of the university  \nAny person who is an Estonian citizen, who is or has been elected to the position of a \nprofessor and who is less than 60 years of age may be a candidate for the position of Rector \nFinland \nHigh \nUniversities Act (645\/1997) Section 13 Rector and vice-rectors : (2) The rector shall be \nelected for a five year term at a time. The rector shall be elected by a university electoral \ncollege. \n(The appointment is internal and renewable) \n \nApplying these descriptions to the legislation relating to the appointment of the Rector in \nall countries, gives the results shown in table 8 below. As can be seen, in sixteen nations the \nappointment of Rector is still internal and with the academic staff exercising the major voice, \nin five states the system allows the academic staff a limited input into the choice of Rector, \nwhile in two nations the Rector\u2019s post is open to external candidates and the academic staff do \nnot have a definitive impact on the choice. \nTable 8 Legislation on the appointment of the rector - examples \n \nNation Level of Protection Nation Level of Protection \nAustria High Lithuania High \nCzech Republic High Luxembourg High \nDenmark Low Malta High \nEstonia Medium Netherlands Medium \nFinland High Poland High \nFrance High Portugal High \nGermany Medium Slovakia High \nGreece High Slovenia High \nHungary High Spain High \nIreland Medium Sweden Medium \nItaly High U.K. Low \nLatvia High   \np.15 \n \nThe final parameter chosen for inclusion in the study is the existence of academic tenure. \nIt has been argued by Chait and Ford that \u2018academic freedom can survive apart from tenure\u2019 \n(Chait and Ford, 1982, 341), while Sartorius\u2019s analysis (Sartorius, 1975) concluded that \ntenure is not a necessary or sufficient condition for the protection of the faculty given that, in \nthe United States at least, a large proportion of academics do not have tenure. However, the \nUNESCO recommendations, which were designed to be internationally applicable,  \nunequivocally state: \u2018Tenure ... constitutes one of the major procedural safeguards of \nacademic freedom\u2019 (UNESCO, 1997,  32), a view endorsed by McPherson and Schapiro who \nnote that \u2018Faculty members with tenure will have more independence. Administrators need to \nrely more on persuasion and less on negative sanctions ... Tenure increases the ability of \nfaculty collectively to shape institutional decisions, through their actions in departments, \ncolleges, or the institution as a whole\u2019 (McPherson and Schapiro, 1999, 81). More \nimportantly, in respect to academic freedom, De George remarks that \u2018By giving a large \nnumber of the faculty tenure \u2026 they are in a position to defend the academic freedom not \nonly of themselves but of all the non-tenured members of the institution, as well as the \nacademic freedom of faculty at other institutions\u2019 (De George, 2003, 18). In addition, as \nMenand points out \u2018Academic freedom not only protects sociology professors from the \ninterference of trustees and public officials in the exercise of their jobs as teachers and \nscholars; it protects them from physics professors as well\u2019 (Menand, 1996, 17). \nUnfortunately Byse and Joughin found that analysing tenure is problematic because \n\u2018Tenure is embodied in a bewildering variety of policies, plans and practices; the range \nreveals extraordinary differences in generosity, explicitness and intelligibility. ... there is no \nconsensus concerning either the criteria or the procedures for acquiring and terminating \ntenure\u2019 (Byse and Joughin, 1959, 133). However, in those E.U. states where staff are granted \ntenure (albeit after a probationary term), and which can only be terminated for just cause \n(usually relating to repeated incompetence, dishonesty and, in some states, financial \nexigency), tenure is, in Van Alstyne\u2019s words, \u2018translatable as a statement of formal assurance \nthat the individual's professional security and academic freedom will not be placed in question \nwithout the observance of full academic due process\u2019 (Van Alstyne, 1971, 329). In such \ncircumstances, the protection provided for academic freedom will be high while, by contrast, \nin states in which there is no tenure whatsoever for staff, the protection for academic freedom \nwill be low.  \np.16 \nAs with many other parameters of academic freedom, between these two opposite poles \nthere will be a variety of tenure procedures offering varying degrees of protection. Moreover, \nin some European states, national employment legislation on dismissal may make a law on \nacademic tenure unnecessary. In some European nations, for example France and Portugal, \nacademic staff have the same employment status, rights and protections as civil servants and, \nthereby, the same level of job security. In other nations, the process of recruitment to tenured \nposts is undergoing change. For example, in Spain the Conservative Government introduced \nreforms to the process of university staff selection in 2002, but when the Socialists were \nreturned to power in 2004, the system was frozen and another process is being introduced. As \nwith the other parameters considered in this study, the procedures for granting tenure were \nscrutinised and allocated the descriptions of high, medium or low, in accordance with the \nlevel of job security offered to staff \u2013 examples of how this was undertaken are given in table \n9 below. \nTable 9 Legislation to protect academic tenure - examples \n \nState\/Level of \nProtection Legislation to protect academic tenure \nAustria \nMedium \nAct No. 120\/2002 \/ 9th August, 2002. Chapter 3, University academic and art staff - University\nProfessors \n97. The professors shall be responsible for research and teaching, or the advancement and \nappreciation of the arts, and for teaching in their field, and shall be employed by the university \non a temporary or permanent basis. They shall be full-or part-time employees. \n(3) University professors shall be appointed by the rector following an appointment procedure \nin accordance with sections 98 or 99. \nTerm of employment contracts: 109. (1) Employment contracts may be of indefinite or \nlimited term. The term of limited term employment contracts shall not exceed six years, on \npain of invalidity, unless otherwise provided for by this Act \nGreece \nHigh \nGreek Constitution 11 June 1975 Article 17: 6. Professors of university level institutions shall \nbe public functionaries. The remaining teaching personnel likewise perform a public \nfunction, under the conditions specified by law. Professors of university level institutions \nshall not be dismissed prior to the lawful termination of their term of service, except in the \ncases of the substantive conditions provided by article 88 paragraph 4 and following a \ndecision by a council constituted in its majority of highest judicial functionaries, as specified \nby law. Law 2083 in 1992 Only those belonging to the two upper ranks of the academic \nhierarchy are elected to permanent (tenured) positions. Appointments and promotion of all \nteaching staff is made by special electoral bodies, which meet together with the General \nAssemblies of the departments \nMalta \nLow \nEducation Act 16th April, 1991, Part V Section 33. The Council shall be the supreme \ngoverning body of the University and shall have the following functions: \n(b) to establish and abolish posts of an academic nature or otherwise; \n(e) to make appointments to posts, of an academic nature or otherwise, in accordance with \nprocedures established by statutes \n \nThis data revealed that it is rare for academics to be offered tenure unconditionally, and \neven where tenure is offered, it is usually following a probationary period. Hence, in many \ncountries academic posts are filled by a competitive process, and employment is offered for \nlimited periods. In the case of Lithuania, for example, Professors have to compete for \np.17 \nemployment for a five year period, but if they win a competition for a third five year period, \nthey acquire the right to hold the post until they are 65. In the Netherlands there is no law \nprotecting academic tenure, and although Professors had, de facto, tenure owing to their \nemployment status as civil servants, this situation is changing as greater institutional \nautonomy brings with it a shift towards institutional and individual contracts for academic \nstaff. Similarly, in the U.K., there is no law protecting tenure, in fact legislation was enacted \nspecifically to remove tenure from University staff. Applying the descriptions of High, \nmedium and low to the legislation relating to tenure in all the sample nations, gives the results \nin table 10, which shows that the system for granting tenure offers high protection for \nacademic freedom in eleven states, and medium protection in nine, while in the U.K. only \nacademic staff in the \u201cold\u201d university sector, and who were appointed before November 1987, \nhave any employment protection. \nTable 10 Legislation to protect academic tenure - summary \n \nNation Level of Protection Nation Level of Protection \nAustria Medium Lithuania Medium \nCzech Republic High Luxembourg Medium \nDenmark Low Malta Low \nEstonia Medium Netherlands Medium \nFinland High Poland High \nFrance High Portugal High \nGermany Medium Slovakia Medium \nGreece High Slovenia High \nHungary High Spain High \nIreland High Sweden High \nItaly Medium U.K. Low \nLatvia Medium   \nSummary and Conclusions \nCombining the results of the previous tables enables the summary Table 11 to be derived. The \ndata demonstrates that there is a high level of consensus in many of the descriptions of \nacademic freedom and the methods for protecting it, although there are differences between \nthe level of protection offered in different states. The table shows that, despite the subjectivity \ninvolved in applying descriptors to the different legal measures, there is general consistency \nwithin countries between the descriptions of the parameters of the health of academic freedom \nthat were used. As can be seen, in five countries the level of protection for academic freedom \nis high across all five parameters, and three of the states in this group were formerly under the \ninfluence of the USSR. By contrast, in terms of the health of academic freedom, the U.K. is \nclearly the sick man of Europe. In Finland (for example), freedom of speech and academic \nfreedom are protected by the constitution, and in legislation, the system of governance \np.18 \nensures that the academic staff have a majority voice in institutional decision making, the \nRector is an elected, internal appointment, and academic tenure is protected, and academic \nstaff have the status of civil servants. By contrast, in the U.K., there is no constitutional \nprotection for either freedom of speech or academic freedom, the law on academic freedom is \ndesigned to ensure \u2018just cause\u2019 for employment termination, the academic staff have only a \nminor input in the decision making process, the Rector is an external appointment over which \nthey have no rights, and academic tenure exists for only a few staff, who are dwindling in \nnumber as retirement beckons. These circumstances have led Barnett to argue that \u2018In such an \nenvironment academic freedom is not taken away; rather, the opportunities for its realisation \nare reduced\u2019 (Barnett, 1997, 53). \nTable 11 Summary table of results. \n \nNation Constitutional Protection \nSpecific \nLegislative \nProtection \nSelf \nGovernance \nAppointment of \nRector Academic Tenure\nFinland High High High High High \nSlovenia High High High High High \nCzech Republic High High High High High \nHungary High High High High High \nSpain High High High High High \nLatvia High High High High Medium \nLithuania High High High High Medium \nSlovakia High High High High Medium \nPoland High Medium High High High \nAustria High Medium High High Medium \nFrance Medium High Medium High High \nPortugal High Medium Medium High High \nItaly High Low High High Medium \nGreece Medium Low Medium High High \nEstonia High Medium High Medium Medium \nGermany Medium High High Medium Medium \nIreland Medium High Low Medium High \nLuxembourg Medium Medium Medium High Medium \nMalta Medium Low Medium High Low \nSweden Medium Low Low Medium High \nDenmark Medium Medium Low Low Low \nNetherlands Low Low Low Medium Medium \nU.K. Low Low Low Low Low \n \nIn 1963, Lord Chorley, the General Secretary of the U.K. Association of University \nTeachers, declaimed: \u2018On balance I think it is fair to say that academic freedom is enjoyed as \nfully in English universities as anywhere else in the world. ... British academic staff have very \nlittle to complain of\u2019 (Chorley, 1963, 650, 666). Such a comment would not be made today, \ndespite the belief expressed in 1994 by the U.K. minister for further and higher education that \n\u2018The tradition of \u201cacademic freedom\u201d is accepted by all interests, and is jealously guarded\u2019 \n(Boswell, 1994). Indeed, the eradication of academic freedom in the U.K. has led Kogan (who \np.19 \nhad previously been the Vice-Chancellor of a U.K. University) to comment \u2018it is not easy to \nsee what can be recommended to the attention of colleagues in other countries\u2019 and to hope \nthat universities in Portugal (and, one suspects, elsewhere in the E.U.) \u2018will not be made to \nfollow the British example\u2019 (Kogan, 2001, 56f). \nUniversities in many E.U. states are experiencing pressure to move towards the British \nmodel of greater managerialism, which has been accompanied by the decline in academic \nfreedom in the U.K. The reasons for this shift are complex, but include the (apparent) need for \ngreater managerial professionalism, both as the participation rate in higher education rises, \nand as the universities\u2019 research role becomes ever more important in determining national \nprosperity, within the emerging global knowledge economy. However, OECD statistics reveal \nthat the participation rate in higher education in 2003 was 73% in Finland, but only 48% in \nthe U.K. (OECD, 2005, table C2.2). Similarly, irrespective as to the method utilised to \nmeasure the growth of the national knowledge economy, or the university sector\u2019s \ncontribution to it, OECD statistics show that Finland consistently outscores the U.K., and \nmost other E.U. states (OECD, 2003). This suggests that increased managerialism (and the \naccompanying reduction in academic freedom) does not aid achievement of the new goals \nassigned to higher education, indeed the opposite may be the case. Moreover, given the \nconvergence between universities and other knowledge based companies, it is worth noting \nthat \u2018the hierarchical model of management that has gained such prominence in higher \neducation in recent years has actually won few supporters in the modern business world. \u2026 \nthe principles and practices of shared governance that have emerged over the past century in \nour best colleges and universities have more relevance for businesses in the new economy \nthan a highly questionable model of corporate governance has for our institutions of higher \neducation\u2019 (Gerber, 2001, 25). Furthermore, attempts to introduce greater managerial control \nin higher education may prove counterproductive for, as Birnbaum, in his study of \nmanagement fads in higher education, points out, \u2018it is no easier to get people to implement a \nmanagement strategy inconsistent with their values than it is to get internal combustion from \nwater\u2019 (Birnbaum, 2001, xii). \nThis study demonstrates the possibility of providing comparable measures of the legal \nprotection for academic freedom in Europe, reveals that the health of academic freedom \nvaries between states and needs nurturing if it is to survive, and suggests how this preliminary \ncomparative analysis could usefully be carried forward. First, this analysis should be extended \nto include academic staff both in Bulgaria and Romania, (which entered the E.U. while this \nresearch was being conducted) and in the other institutions of European higher education, \np.20 \nnotably the polytechnics and the private sector universities. Secondly, legal documents \nprovide the quantitative \u201cbare bones\u201d of academic freedom, but what is also required is a \nqualitative analysis of how these legal documents are interpreted within the everyday \ninteractions of academic staff (Lecturers, Professors, Departmental Heads, Deans and \nRectors) in European higher education. Bennich-Bj\u00f6rkman\u2019s study of academic freedom in \nSweden, in which academics were interviewed about \u2018their view of the content of academic \nfreedom, on the current prospects for its survival, on the effect of institutional structures on \nthe content of research and on the research process as such\u2019 (Bennich-Bj\u00f6rkman, 2004, 7), \nprovides a useful example of how this could be successfully undertaken. Thirdly, some \nparallel assessment of the level of academic freedom enjoyed by students in the E.U. should \nbe attempted. Such additional research would provide hope of realising Altbach\u2019s aspiration \nthat \u2018With more data, it would be possible to create a \u201cworld academic freedom barometer\u201d as \nis done for human rights, corruption, and other issues\u2019 (Altbach, 2001, 210). \nAdditionally, the proposed Constitution for the European Union states that \u2018The arts and \nscientific research shall be free of constraint. Academic freedom shall be respected\u2019 (E.U., \n2005, 50). The Constitution received insufficient support among the E.U. nations to be \nenacted into law. However, if the process of integration among the 27 (and more) member \nstates is to proceed, a document of similar status is likely to be ratified within the next decade. \nFurther work is therefore required to ensure that such a document acknowledges and protects \nacademic freedom. For this to be possible, first, a succinct yet inclusive and coherent working \ndefinition of academic freedom is needed for Universities in the E.U. nations, derived from, \nand built on, their historic commitment to this principle. Second, and more importantly, the \nreasons justifying academic freedom need to be voiced clearly and loudly for, as John Stuart \nMill accurately and eloquently observed, \u2018(When) the most active and inquiring intellects find \nit advisable to keep the general principles and grounds of their convictions within their own \nbreasts ... the price paid for this sort of intellectual pacification is the sacrifice of the entire \nmoral courage of the human mind\u2019 (Mill, 1951, 31). \n \n \np.21 \nBibliography \nALTBACH, P.
