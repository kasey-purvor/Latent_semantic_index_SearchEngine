The EAAD intervention\nconsists of (1) training sessions and practice support for primary care physicians,(2) public relations\nactivities and mass media campaigns, (3) training sessions for community facilitators who serve as\ngatekeepers for depressed and suicidal persons in the community and treatment and (4) outreach\nand support for high risk and self-help groups (e.g. helplines). The intervention has been shown to\nbe effective in reducing suicidal behaviour in an earlier study, the Nuremberg Alliance Against\nDepression. In the context of the current research project described in this paper (OSPI-Europe)\nPublished: 23 November 2009\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:428 doi:10.1186\/1471-2458-9-428\nReceived: 1 September 2009\nAccepted: 23 November 2009\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/9\/428\n\u00a9 2009 Hegerl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:428 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/9\/428the EAAD model is enhanced by other evidence based interventions and implemented\nsimultaneously and in standardised way in four regions in Ireland, Portugal, Hungary and Germany.\nThe enhanced intervention will be evaluated using a prospective controlled design with the primary\noutcomes being composite suicidal acts (fatal and non-fatal), and with intermediate outcomes being\nthe effect of training programs, changes in public attitudes, guideline-consistent media reporting.

It pools data from four European regions, considerably increasing the study\nsample, which will be close to one million. In addition, the study will gather important information\nconcerning the potential to transfer this multilevel program to other health care systems. The\nresults of this research will provide a basis for developing an evidence-based, efficient concept for\nsuicide prevention for EU-member states.\nBackground\nPublic health relevance of suicide in the European Union\nFatal and non-fatal suicide acts are a significant public\nhealth issue. This is especially the case in Europe where\nthe highest rates for completed suicide in the world are\nfound [1]. Every year more than 58,000 persons die by\nsuicide within the European Union. According to World\nHealth Organization (WHO data), suicide is among the\n10 leading causes of death for all ages [2]. Suicidal acts\npose a considerable burden of disease and death. Suicide\nneeds to be viewed not only as the premature end of a\nhuman life but as affecting and traumatising family mem-\nbers and other persons involved. Therefore, in 1984 the\nWHO's European Member States defined the reduction of\nsuicide as one of its main health policy targets and rein-\nforced this target in several position papers [3]. In addi-\ntion, preventing suicide is one of the five areas of priority\nof the European Pact for Mental Health and Well-Being,\nwhich was launched by the European Commission in\n2008 [4].\nClosely related to completed suicides are non-fatal sui-\ncidal acts. The rate of non-fatal suicidal acts is estimated to\nbe about 10 times higher than that of suicides. Non-fatal\nsuicidal acts are the strongest predictor for completed sui-\ncide, especially in males [5]. Thus, every global strategy to\nprevent suicide should also include the prevention of\nnon-fatal suicidal acts, not only as a goal in itself, but as\nan efficient means of preventing completed suicides.\nRates of non-fatal suicidal acts and suicides depend on\nmany factors. It is estimated that in Europe 90% of sui-\ncides occur within the context of a psychiatric disorder [6].\nDepression is most commonly associated with suicide,\nbut other affective disorders, alcohol and substance abuse\ndisorders, and schizophrenia also frequently underlie sui-\ncidal behaviour [7-10]. Yet, suicidality and the transition\nfrom non-lethal to lethal acts are complex phenomena,\ncomplicated by access to lethal means, gender, and cul-\ntural and social factors including attitudes towards suicid-\nality, as well as personality factors such as impulsivity.\nBecause of the multi-factorial nature of suicidality, inter-\nventions that address the problem on multiple levels are\nconsidered to be most effective. However, strong evidence\ndelineating the most effective strategy to prevent suicidal-\nity and the necessary components of suicide prevention\nprograms is lacking [6,11].\nIn the face of the complexity of risk for suicide, and scarce\nevidence but nevertheless a high need for on effective sui-\ncide prevention on a community level, the European\nCommission recently committed to financing a research\nproject within the seventh Framework Program with the\ngoal of optimizing suicide prevention programs and their\nimplementation in Europe (OSPI-Europe).\nThe aim of OSPI-Europe is to provide diverse regional pol-\nicy makers and the European Commission with an evi-\ndence based, efficient concept for suicide prevention\nalong with the corresponding materials and instruments\nfor the multifaceted intervention and guidelines for the\nimplementation process.\nThe specific study objectives include:\n1. To develop a state of the art intervention concept for the\nprevention of suicidality that considers current evidence\nbased best practices and international experiences with\nmultilevel interventions.\n2. To implement a multilevel community based interven-\ntion in four culturally different European model regions\nin a comparable manner.Page 2 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:428 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/9\/4283. To evaluate the intervention in a controlled, cross-\ncountry comparable design including primary and sec-\nondary outcomes, as well as to perform process and eco-\nnomic evaluations.\nAn outline of the research concept is presented in Figure 1.\nGroundwork\nThe groundwork for the OSPI-Europe project was estab-\nlished through a community based multifaceted interven-\ntion program for improving care of depression and for\npreventing suicidality that was implemented in Nurem-\nberg, Germany, a city with a population of 500,000 inhab-\nitants (Nuremberg Alliance Against Depression, NAD)\n[12]. The Nuremberg intervention approached the pre-\nvention of suicide and non-fatal suicidal acts by focusing\nnot only on improving the treatment of depression but\nalso by implementing other measures, such as influencing\nthe media to report suicide in a responsible, non-sensa-\ntional and respectful manner. The hypothesis was that\nimprovement in depression awareness and treatment\nwould lead to a reduction in suicidal behaviour on a pop-\nulation basis. The NAD comprised a 4-level intervention:\n1. Training and practice support for primary care phy-\nsicians in detecting and treating depression\n2. Public relations activities for informing the general\npublic about depression, including anti-stigma cam-\npaigns.\n3. Training sessions on depression and suicidality for\ncommunity facilitators such as priests, social workers,\ngeriatric care givers, teachers and journalists who are\ngatekeepers in a position to direct vulnerable and high\nrisk persons into effective treatment\n4. Overtures to high risk groups (persons after non-\nfatal suicidal acts), establishment of help lines and\nsupport of self-help activities involving patients and\nrelatives\nThe NAD was rigorously evaluated according to a control-\nled pre-post design with the number of suicidal acts (fatal\nand non-fatal) as primary outcome. After two years of\nintervention, a major reduction in the number of suicidal\nacts was found compared to the baseline year (-24%, p <\n0.005). This reduction was clearly significant compared to\ncorresponding changes in the control region (Wuerz-\nburg). The reduction was even more pronounced (-53%,\np < 0.01) in secondary analyses examining only the five\nmost lethal suicide attempt methods [13].\nThe 4-level intervention concept of NAD was further\nrefined and transferred to other EU countries. Thereby the\nEuropean Alliance Against Depression (EAAD) came\ntogether [14-16]. The EAAD was an EU-funded network of\npartners from 17 countries that all aimed to implement\nthe 4-level intervention concept in their regions, adapting\nit to local conditions even while preserving what were\nviewed as the key components. The strong evidence base,\nmaterials, concepts and evaluation tools of the NAD,\ncombined with the network and experience of the EAAD\nOSPI-Europe Research ConceptFigure 1\nOSPI-Europe Research Concept.Page 3 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:428 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/9\/428constitutes the background, as well as the starting point\nfrom which OSPI-Europe was developed.\nMethodological challenges in assessing the effectiveness of \nsuicide prevention programs\nOne of the challenges of field research on suicide preven-\ntion is that because of a low base rate in completed sui-\ncides, it has been notoriously difficult to provide strong\nevidence concerning suicide-preventive effectiveness for\nany particular measure (e.g. interventions with high risk\ngroups, public relations campaigns, etc) [11]. The smaller\nthe population under observation, the higher the risk to\nmiss statistically even highly relevant effects on suicide\nrates. In order to address this issue OSPI-Europe seeks to\nincrease statistical power by two approaches: (1) Increas-\ning the size of the population under observation (denom-\ninator) by aggregating data from four regions that\nimplement a similar suicide prevention program, and (2)\nincreasing the numerator by constructing a composite pri-\nmary outcome, consisting of completed suicides but also\nnon-fatal suicidal acts.\nMethods\/design\nDevelopment of a state of the art intervention concept\nPrior to designing the optimal intervention, the literature\nwas been systematically reviewed and experts in suicidal-\nity research consulted. The criterion for selecting individ-\nual preventive strategies was scientific evidence for4\neffectiveness. In addition to evaluating the effects of the\nfive intervention levels separately, the synergistic effects of\nthe multifaceted approach will also be taken into account.\nThe target population, in which suicide is to be prevented,\nranges from adolescence to old age (high rate of suicide in\nmost countries).\nA core element of the state of the art intervention devel-\noped through OSPI-Europe is the EAAD\/NAD 4-level\nintervention concept and the available materials which\nare already in use within the EAAD. There is lower level\nevidence available that the individual strategies combined\nwithin the 4-level intervention concept may be effective\n[6,11]. However, strong evidence is available showing that\nthe four-level intervention is effective as a package [13]. In\nthe context of the research presented here, the original\nEAAD four-level intervention is enhanced by the inclu-\nsion of additional strategies that have recently demon-\nstrated a potential for efficacy. Thus, as part of the\noptimisation process, efforts to restrict access to lethal\nmeans will comprise a fifth intervention level of OSPI-\nEurope. The main focus of the fifth level will include\nactions such as working with local councils to install\nhigher railings at bridges and encouraging the prescrip-\ntion of antidepressants that are less likely to be lethal in\noverdoses.\nImplementation of a multilevel community based \nintervention\nThe intervention concept developed will be implemented\nand tested in regions of four countries (Ireland, Germany,\nHungary, Portugal) in a comparable manner. The coun-\ntries were chosen to represent different EU-health systems\nand different socio-cultural characteristics as outlined in\nTable 1.\nIt was considered unrealistic to randomly select interven-\ntion regions from all EU member states because of the\nmultiple factors on which representativeness could be\ncalled into question.\nWithin each of the four model countries, intervention\nregions are established. Interventions are implemented in\na standardised and synchronized way to ensure compara-\nbility across the regions. This means that interventions\ncontain the same core elements (defined by minimum\nstandard of implementation type and intensity) that are\ndefined as \"obligatory interventions\" and are imple-\nmented in a similar time frame, and in each of the four\nregions. In addition \"optional interventions\" are also\ndefined. These can be implemented in the regions accord-\ning to local requirements and resources. By distinguishing\nbetween obligatory and optional interventions some\nmodification and adaptation to local needs in the differ-\nent regions is allowed, but the basic concept is preserved\nacross intervention sites. The intervention will be imple-\nmented in the four regions over a period of at least 18\nmonths, starting in 2009.\nTable 1: Main characteristics of intervention countries and intervention and control regions\nCountry Health System intervention region control region\nHungary Centralised national health insurance fund, limited private sector Miskolc population 180,000 Szeged population 170,000\nIreland Tax funded public health service, with supplemental voluntary \ninsurance\nLimerick population 184,055 Galway population 231,670\nPortugal mix of National Health Service, special social health insurance schemes \nfor certain professions and private health insurance\nAmadora population 200,000 Almada population 110,000\nGermany Bismarckian\/social health insurance system with strong public-private \npartnership\nLeipzig population 500,000 Magdeburg population 230,000Page 4 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:428 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/9\/428Evaluation of the intervention\nThe intervention is evaluated according to a prospective\nand controlled design. Therefore control regions are cho-\nsen in each intervention country. Control regions are\ncomparable to intervention regions in terms of urbanity\n(please see Table 1 for further details). Evaluations will be\nperformed based on primary and intermediate outcomes.\nAdditionally, a process evaluation and an evaluation of\nthe economic costs and consequences of the intervention\nwill be conducted.\nPrimary and secondary outcomes\nThe primary outcome for evaluating the effect of the\nintervention is the rate of suicidal acts (fatal + non-fatal)\nin the intervention and the control regions at baseline (six\nmonths prior to the start of the intervention), during the\n18 months of the intervention and six months after. The\nmain hypothesis is that the number of suicidal acts will\ndecrease in each intervention region compared to baseline\n(six months prior to the start of the intervention) and that\nthis decrease is significantly stronger than changes\nobserved in the corresponding control regions.\nFor the rates of completed suicides in intervention and\ncontrol regions, the rates published by the respective sta-\ntistical offices are used. Data on non-fatal suicidal acts are\ncollected in general hospital emergency rooms, where per-\nsons after non-fatal suicidal acts seek medical help. Infor-\nmation on non-fatal suicidal acts is recorded using the\ninstrument of the Monitoring Suicidal Behaviour in\nEurope (MONSUE) project which is based on the WHO\/\nEuro Multicentre Study on Suicidal Behaviour [17].\nIntermediate outcomes\nIn order to further measure the effectiveness of the OSPI-\nEurope intervention, the study aims to assess intermediate\noutcomes associated with the single interventions that\nmake up the OSPI-Europe intervention package. These\nfoci on more short term effects are directly linked to the\noperational goals and the content of the interventions,\nsuch as improved awareness, knowledge, confidence, and\nattitude change.\nPrior to the baseline assessment in the four participating\nintervention regions, a standard evaluation methodology\nfor intermediate outcome criteria is developed based on\nreview of the relevant literature, a review of the existing\nEAAD evaluation catalogue and consultation with EAAD I\nand EAAD II partners, as well other researchers\/experts in\nsuicide prevention.\nThe evaluation of intermediate outcomes includes the fol-\nlowing factors:\nPublic attitudes\nA population survey on attitudes and knowledge towards\ndepression and suicidality is performed in the interven-\ntion and control regions at baseline and about 12 months\nfollowing intervention implementation. The survey is\nbased on existing validated instruments: the Depression\nStigma Scale (DSS), [18] and the Attitude Toward Seeking\nProfessional Psychological Help (ATSPPH-SF) question-\nnaire [19]. Five hundred people sampled from the general\npopulation will complete baseline and follow-up tele-\nphone interviews in all intervention and control regions.\nThese will be conducted by a single independent survey\ncompany to ensure consistency of implementation across\nall regions.\nTreatment of depression\nAs a proxy for the treatment of depression, prescription\nrates for antidepressants and other psychopharmaceuti-\ncals will be monitored in the intervention regions by\nusing health insurance data or equivalents, available in\nthe intervention countries.\nTraining programs\nEffects of training for community facilitators and general\npractitioners will be evaluated. Evaluation will be based\non questionnaires such as the DSS [18], Suicide Interven-\ntion Response Inventory (SIRI-2) [20], confidence scales\n[21,22], intervention knowledge test [23], Depression\nAttitude Questionnaire (DAQ) [24,25] and the Attitude\nToward Suicide Prevention Scale [26]. Questionnaires will\nbe tailored to the specific target groups where necessary.\nIn addition, general practitioners' referral to psychological\ntreatment will be evaluated, before and after trainings, as\nwell as at four months follow-up.\nMedia reporting\nMedia reports on suicide (such as articles in the local\nnewspapers) will be collected in the intervention and con-\ntrol regions. The number (quantitative assessment) and\nthe content of the reporting (qualitative analyses) will be\ncompared before and after the intervention. The desired\noutcome is media reporting that is in line with WHO and\nIASP guidelines for responsible suicide reporting.\nEconomic evaluation\nIt is important in a situation where resources are limited\nto consider not only if something works, and in what con-\ntext, but also at what costs. Economic evaluation can help\naid decision makers address this question. It compares the\ncosts and effectiveness of two or more interventions. Our\nhypothesis is that the intervention will lead to reductions\nin the numbers of completed suicides and non-fatal sui-\ncidal acts; this in turn will be associated with an overall\nreduction in the use of resources, such as health care and\nemergency services.Page 5 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:428 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/9\/428In order to calculate the economic costs and consequences\nof the interventions, firstly the costs of suicide and non-\nfatal suicidal acts will be estimated in each of the four\ncountries. This will be done from both a public purse and\nsocietal perspective. A questionnaire will be developed to\ncollect information on the typical resource use for suicidal\nevents, for instance police time inputs and the need for\nongoing treatment and support for non-fatal suicidal acts.\nLifetime productivity losses to the economy due to prema-\nture mortality will be valued using age adjusted average\nwage rates. Intangible costs associated with suicide such as\nthe pain and shock experienced by family members will\nbe imputed using data on the economic impacts of sud-\nden death from road traffic accidents. These data have pre-\nviously been used in valuing the costs of suicide in Ireland\nand Scotland [27,28].\nSecondly, resources, including unpaid volunteer inputs,\nrequired to deliver the intervention will be collated using\nexpert responses to a modified version of the Client Serv-\nice Receipt Inventory (CSRI) [29]; in addition, this instru-\nment will also gather data on some of the costs associated\nwith the initial development and implementation of the\nOSPI-Europe intervention.\nUsing this data we will then be able to construct a cost\neffectiveness analysis comparing changes in the rate of\nsuicidal acts in the intervention and control areas with the\ncosts of delivering the interventions less the costs avoided\nas a result of suicides averted. Sensitivity analysis will be\nused to test how varying assumptions on costs, effective-\nness and fidelity of implementation impact on the likeli-\nhood that the intervention will be cost effective. This will\nbe demonstrated visually using cost effectiveness accepta-\nbility curves. Finally we will also use decision analytical\nmodelling to help project the long term potential costs\nand consequences of the OSPI-intervention of beyond the\nduration of our empirical study period.\nEvaluation of the implementation process\nData about the actual process of implementation will pro-\nvide valuable information about the obstacles encoun-\ntered and the fidelity of the implementation in the\nintervention regions. Specifically at play are the character-\nistics of the local environment which have the potential to\ninfluence both suicidal behaviour and the effective imple-\nmentation of a prevention program. Key issues to be con-\nsidered beyond prevailing local attitudes toward mental\nhealth treatment (which is assessed also as an intermedi-\nate outcome) and patterns of suicidality, concern local\nhealth care structures and resources, ongoing local actions\nor national actions targeting suicidality, and other factors\naffecting mental well-being such as unemployment rates.\nThis contextual information is gathered at both national\nand local level and is used to aid comparisons and under-\nstanding of differences in outcomes between each pair of\nintervention and control regions, as well as across the four\ninterventions sites.\nIn addition, key stakeholders across all four intervention\nsites will be interviewed at six monthly intervals on the\nprogress in the implementation process using semi-struc-\ntured interviews, which will be transcribed and translated\ninto English. This will include gathering information on\nthe local context (and any important intervening events)\nas well the actual implementation process. This includes\ninformation on whether the intervention will succeed in\ninvolving all necessary stakeholders, information on the\nactivities that are implemented in the region and the\nresources available. Of particular interest is additional\nfunding\/support, that is made available to the local activ-\nities, the barriers and facilitators that have impacted on\nthe implementation process and the sustainability of the\ninterventions. The Community Capacity Index (CCI) [30]\nwill be used to assess the added value for regions in engag-\ning in a multi-level intervention and the sustainability of\nlocal activities. This will compliment more quantitative\noutcomes from the OSPI-Europe intervention.\nFinally, the number of activities that form part of the\nintervention such as public events, leaflets distributed,\ntraining sessions held and self-help groups founded will\nbe documented in the intervention regions.\nFunding and Consortium\nThe project is funded by the 7th Research Framework Pro-\ngram of the European Union for the duration of four\nyears. The consortium consists of 14 partners, most of\nwhom took part in EAAD. Therefore, the project will ben-\nefit from previously developed working alliances and a\nculture of discussion and mutual understanding already\nexisting in the EAAD.\nEthical principles\nThe study is planned and will be executed in accordance\nwith the principles laid down in the Helsinki declaration\n(Edinburgh, Scotland amendment, October 2000). The\nstudy protocol was approved both by the Data Protection\nCommission of Saxony, Germany and the Medical Ethical\nBoard of the Leipzig University. In addition the other\nstudy centres in Hungary, Ireland and Portugal are cur-\nrently seeking ethical approval from their local authority.\nDiscussion\nOSPI-Europe aims to provide the EU-member states with\nrealistic evidence-based recommendations and decision-\nsupport regarding the design and implementation of\neffective programs to reduce suicidality. The concrete\nfocus on implementation allows to study the efficiency of\nthe prevention program, as well as a process evaluation ofPage 6 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:428 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/9\/428the implementation itself. Further, the practicability of the\ndeveloped materials and instruments, possible shortcom-\nings, potentials for improvement will be identified and\nimprovements will be made based on lessons learned.\nThereby, the OSPI-Europe project seeks to bridge the gap\nbetween theoretical recommendations and practical\napplication.\nThe limitations of the study design originate in the chal-\nlenges of simultaneously implementing comparable inter-\nventions in four different countries and health systems.\nHowever, process evaluation will entail the collection of\nimportant information regarding the transferability of the\nintervention to different health systems. The close moni-\ntoring of the implementation process will help to control\nand explain differences in implementation that might\noccur at the four intervention sites.\nThe existence of different health care systems may also\ncomplicate evaluation of the intervention. Availability of\nhealth services and specialised mental health care, access\nto psychotherapy, as well as requirements for out of\npocket payments for medication and health services differ\nin the four intervention countries. Data for antidepressant\nprescriptions are available in some countries as health\ninsurance data (Germany), and in others as IMS (Inter-\ncontinental Marketing Services) data. Close cooperation,\nharmonisation of terms and definitions as well as con-\nsenting on minimum standards within the project consor-\ntium are needed to address the challenges with\nsimultaneous data collection.\nFurther challenges emerge by conducting research within\nreal world local environments where it is impossible to\ncontrol other intervening activities such as the introduc-\ntion of National Suicide Prevention strategies (which may\nor may not include specific prevention activities) or other\nlocal initiatives on depression. Other intervention factors,\nsuch as the current economic downturn, which may, for\ninstance, lead to significant job losses in some study areas,\nmay also blur the effectiveness of the intervention. Moni-\ntoring of intermediate effects, as well as precisely docu-\nmenting environmental conditions prior to and during\nthe study within intervention and control regions, should\nallow for more robust interpretation and understanding\nof primary and secondary outcomes.\nThe strengths of the design relate to its being grounded in\nan intervention and evaluation concept that has previ-\nously been shown to be effective [13]. Moreover, the Euro-\npean Alliance Against Depression (EAAD) has\ndemonstrated that it is possible to implement basic ele-\nments of the OSPI-Europe intervention in different Euro-\npean countries and health systems according to a\nstandardised procedure [15]. Finally, the OSPI-Europe\nconsortium is built on the foundations of the EAAD, and\nthus draws on the networks, expertise, prior collaboration\nand knowledge exchange culture that has been developed\nin the different EAAD countries and during EAAD co-\noperations since its foundation in 2004.\nFor OSPI-Europe to make a contribution to suicide pre-\nvention in the European Community, OSPI-Europe needs\nnot only to construct a strong intervention and conduct\nhigh level research, but it also needs to disseminate results\neffectively. Dissemination strategies, which are not pre-\nsented in detail in the context of this paper, remain a key\ncomponent of the project. Strategies tailored to different\naudiences can help facilitate the translation of research\nresults into policies and action. This article is meant to be\na contribution to this dissemination strategy.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nUH is principle investigator, all participants have contrib-\nuted their part of expertise and read and approved the lat-\nest version of the article.\nReferences\n1.
