INTRODUCTION\nCarrier frequency offsets (CFOs) caused by Doppler shift\nand oscillator instability can affect signi\ufb01cantly the overall\nperformance of digital communication systems. State-of-the-\nart approaches for solving this problem can be classi\ufb01ed into\ntwo main categories, i.e., coherent approaches and differential-\ncoherent approaches. The coherent approaches are usually\nbased on the carefully designed CFO estimators, which have\nbeen intensively investigated for the end-to-end communi-\ncations (e.g., [1]-[2]). Recently, the CFO estimation issue\nis mainly focused on the network scenario, i.e., multiuser\nand multi-link cases (e.g., [3]-[4]). On the other hand, the\nimperfect CFO estimation and compensation can still affect\nthe overall system performance. The differential-coherent ap-\nproaches mainly refer to the doubly differential communi-\ncations, which have been originally proposed by Okunev in\n1979 [5]. Afterwards, this technique has been applied in many\nadvance wireless systems such as multi-antenna systems (e.g.,\n[6]) and block transmissions (e.g., [7]). The major advantage\nof the doubly differential communication is its bypass of the\nCFO and channel estimation. However, the pay for this nice\nfeature is the considerable loss in the received signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) (up to 7.8 dB loss [8]).\nIn the wireless networks, distributed nodes can establish\nef\ufb01cient cooperation to exploit the distributed spatial diversity.\nThe node cooperation is usually based on some classical\nrelaying protocols such as selection detection-forward (DF),\namplify-forward, etc. [9]-[11]. While the sub-channels are\northogonal with each other, the receiver can employ the\nThe work reported in this paper has formed part of the Core 4 Research\nProgramme of the Virtual Centre of Excellence in Mobile and Personal\nCommunications, Mobile VCE, www.mobilevce.com, whose funding support,\nincluding that of EPSRC, is gratefully acknowledged.

This impressive result motivates us\nto employ the half-duplex cooperative relay to compensate\nthe SNR loss inherent in the doubly differential communica-\ntions. In this paper, we consider the relay operating in the\nselection DF mode, i.e., the relay can forward the received\nsymbols when the received SNR is larger than a threshold.\nThe receiver can employ two kind of combiners to attain the\nachievable cooperative diversity-gain. Considering the single-\nrelay case, the overall performance is carefully investigated\nfor the slow Rayleigh-fading channel. The selection of the\nSNR threshold is also carefully studied for the performance\noptimization. Computer simulations are carried out for various\nchannel setup, which can clearly disclose the effect of the SNR\ncompensation.\nII. DOUBLY DIFFERENTIAL COMMUNICATION AND SNR\nCOMPENSATION\nA. Doubly differential Communication\nHere, we introduce brie\ufb02y the work philosophy for the\ndouble differential communication. Prior to transmission,\nthe sender \ufb01rst format the information-bearing bits into an\nM \u00d7 1 symbol block with N -PSK modulation, i.e., s =\n[s0 , s1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , sM\u22121 ]T. The symbols are fed into the doubly\ndifferential modulator [8], which relates the input s to the\noutput x as\nxm = x\n\u2217\nm\u22121\u2212\u03c4 xm\u22121xm\u2212\u03c4 sm , (1)\nwhere m stands for the symbol index, \u03c4 (\u0001 1) for the lag,\nthe superscript \u2217 for the conjugate, and the terms x\u22121\u2212\u03c4 , x\u2212\u03c4 ,\nx\u22121 , |sm |, are set to 1 for convenience. Then, the symbols xm\nare transmitted through the sender-destination (SD) channel\nh\n(sd) ((sd) stands for the SD channel). Denote \u03bd to be the CFO\nnormalized by the block duration. The received symbols at the\ndestination are expressible as\ny\n(sd)\nm\n= e\nj2\u03c0\u03bdm\nM h\n(sd)\nxm + v\n(sd)\nm\n, (2)\nwhere v stands for the Gaussian noise with zero mean and\nvariance of N\no\n. At the receiver, the doubly differential de-\nmodulation can be implemented as below\nz\n(sd)\nm\n= y\n(sd)\nm\u22121\u2212\u03c4\n[\ny\n(sd)\nm\u2212\u03c4 y\n(sd)\nm\u22121\n]\u2217\ny\n(sd)\nm\n, (3)\n\u2248\n\u2223\u2223\u2223h(sd) \u2223\u2223\u22234 sm + v\u00af(sd)m , (4)\n978-1-4244-1645-5\/08\/$25.00  \u00a92008 IEEE 644\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Then, the symbol detection can be performed\nby checking the phase of z. This process does not need the\nCFO and channel knowledge.\nGini and Giannakis have calculated the variance of v\u00af(sd)\nin [8], i.e., \u03b7|h(sd) |6No and \u03b7 = 4 + 2\u03b4(\u03c4 \u2212 1). Hence, the\ninstant-SNR for the output z(sd) (denoted by \u03b3(sd)\nz\n) can be\nobtained as \u03b3(sd)\nz\n= (|h(sd) |2)\/(\u03b7N\no\n). In comparison with\nthe instant-SNR for the coherent communication [12], i.e.,\n\u03b3\n(sd)\nc\n= (|h(sd) |2)\/(N\no\n), the double differential communication\nlosses up to 7.8 dB in SNR (i.e., \u03c4 = 1). This is the\nsigni\ufb01cant performance cost, which can limit the application\nin the practical system. To see the overall system performance,\nwe can also calculate the average-SER (denoted by P) for the\nRayleigh-fading channel (see [13] for detail derivation), i.e.,\nP\n(sd)\n\u0002 E\n(\n\u03b2Q\n(\u221a\n\u03b1\u03b3(sd)\nz\n))\n, (5)\n\u0002 \u03b2\n2\u03b1\u03b3\u00af(sd)\nz\n, (6)\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 is the modulation coef\ufb01cient, \u03b3\u00af the average-\nSNR, E(\u00b7) the expectation, and Q(\u00b7) the Gaussian Q-function.\nAccordingly, we can assume the perfect channel and CFO\nestimation and obtain the average-SER for the coherent com-\nmunication, i.e., P\n(sd)\nc\n= (P\n(sd)\n)\/(\u03b7). This result can clearly\ndisclose the performance degradation due to the doubly dif-\nferential technology.\nB. SNR Compensation with Single Relay\nAs depicted in Fig. 1, we employ a selection-DF relay\n(equipped with a doubly differential modem) to help the SD\ncommunication. The relay \ufb01rst perform the doubly differential\ndemodulation and detection on the received symbols, and\nobtain the result s(r)\nm\n= s\nm\n+ e\nm\n, where e\nm\ndenotes the\ndetection error, and (r) the label for relay. Then, the symbols\ns\n(r)\nare fed into the doubly differential modulator. The output\nof the modulator can be sent to the destination if the received\nSNR for the sender-relay (SR) link (denoted by \u03b3(sr)\nz\n) is larger\nthan the threshold \u03b3t.\nWhile \u03b3(sr)\nz\nis smaller than \u03b3t , the destination can receive\nnothing from the relay. Then, the performance is exactly the\nSD link performance. The probability for this event is the\noutage probability, which has been given in [9], i.e.,\nPr\n(\n\u03b3\n(sr)\nz\n< \u03b3t\n)\n= 1\u2212 e\n\u2212\u03b3t\n\u03b3\u00af\n(sr)\nz . (7)\nIn the case of \u03b3(sr)\nz\n\u0001 \u03b3t , the destination can receive a\nsymbol block from the relay. After the doubly differential\ndemodulation, we can obtain the following block\nz\n(rd)\nm\n=\n\u2223\u2223\u2223h(rd)\u2223\u2223\u22234 s(r)\nm\n+ v\u00af\n(rd)\nm\n, (8)\nwhere the superscript (rd) stands for the relay-destination\n(RD) link. Then, the destination can perform the combination\nof z(rd)\nm\nand z(sd)\nm\nfor exploiting the achievable diversity-gain,\ni.e.,\nz\u00afm = w\n(rd)\nz\n(rd)\nm\n+ w\n(sd)\nz\n(sd)\nm\n, (9)\nFig. 1. Block diagram of the doubly differential communication assisted\nwith single cooperative relay.\nwhere w(rd) , w(sd) is the weighting coef\ufb01cient. However, the\nchannel knowledge is not available at the destination, such\nthat the MRC or equal-gain combine (EGC) is not possible.\nNext, we will introduce two kind of combiners. To clarify the\npresentation, we assume but only here em = 0.\n1) Direct Combiner (DC): The implementation of this\ncombiner is simple, i.e., w(rd) = w(sd) = 1. Then, the instant\nSNR for the output z\u00af can be computed as\n\u03b3\n(DC)\nz\u00af\n=\n(\u2223\u2223\u2223h(sd) \u2223\u2223\u22234 + \u2223\u2223\u2223h(rd)\u2223\u2223\u22234)2\n\u03b7N\no\n(\u2223\u2223h(sd) \u2223\u22236 + \u2223\u2223h(rd)\u2223\u22236) . (10)\nThis approach can be regarded as the simpli\ufb01ed version of\nthe piecewise-linear combiner proposed in [14]. The average-\nSER analysis for this combiner is extremely dif\ufb01cult. In the\nliterature [15], Zhao and Li have carried out the performance\nanalysis for the single-differential BPSK system. However,\nthey have not provided a close-form formulation. Fortunately,\nwe \ufb01nd that \u03b3(DC)\nz\u00af\nful\ufb01lls the following inequality\n0.5\u03b3\n(MRC)\nz\u00af\n< \u03b3\n(EGC)\nz\u00af\n\u0002 \u03b3(DC)\nz\u00af\n\u0002 \u03b3(MRC)\nz\u00af\n, (11)\nwhere \u03b3(EGC)\nz\u00af\n= (|h(sd) | + |h(rd) |)2\/(2\u03b7N\no\n) and \u03b3(MRC)\nz\u00af\n=\n(|h(sd) |2 + |h(rd) |2)\/(\u03b7No). The equality holds under the con-\ndition |h(sd) | = |h(rd) |. The proof of (11) is strenuous but\nstraightforward. This result indicates that the SER performance\nfor EGC (MRC) is the upper-bound (lower-bound) for the\ndirect combiner.\n2) Statistical Combiner (SC): In this combiner, the coef-\n\ufb01cient w for the corresponding link can be implemented as\nbelow\nw =\n(\n1\n\u03bbM\nM\u22121\u2211\nm=0\nzN\nm\n)\u2212 12N\n, (12)\nwhere \u03bb is a constant. We can see that the weighting coef\ufb01-\ncient is obtained via the high-order statistics of the received\nsymbols. The idea of this design is based on the impressive\nfeature of the N -PSK symbols, i.e., sN = \u03bb (e.g., \u03bb = \u22121 for\nthe PSK constellation de\ufb01ned by IEEE 802.11a). In the case of\nlarge-SNR or large M , the coef\ufb01cient w can be very close to\nthe value |h|\u22122, which is actually the MRC coef\ufb01cient. Since\nthe block size M is usually large (e.g., 100), we can use the\nMRC result as the approximate performance. Based on the\n645\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 17,2010 at 10:49:41 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nabove proposed combiners, we can carry out the performance\nanalysis as follows.\nC. Performance Analysis\nWe can use (7) to obtain the probability Pr(\u03b3(sr)\nz\n\u0001 \u03b3t) =\nexp[(\u2212\u03b3t)\/(\u03b3\u00af(sr))]. The event (\u03b3(sr)z \u0001 \u03b3t) includes two cases,\ni.e., em = 0 and em \u0002= 0. The probability for the fore case can\nbe upper bounded by 1. For the later case, the error probability\nat the destination can be upper bounded by 1. As a summary\nof the above analysis, the overall average-SER performance\ncan be upper bounded as\nP(z)\u0002 Pr(\u03b3(sr)\nz\n< \u03b3t)P\n(sd)\n+Pr(\u03b3\n(sr)\nz\n\u0001 \u03b3t)(Pr(em \u0002= 0|\u03b3\n(sr)\nz\n\u0001 \u03b3t) + P(z\u00af)). (13)\nWe can use the Marcum Q-function in [13] to analyze the\nconditional probability Pr(em \u0002= 0|\u03b3\n(sr)\nz\n\u0001 \u03b3t), which is\ndetailed as below\nPr(em \u0002= 0|\u03b3\n(sr)\nz\n\u0001 \u03b3t)\n=\n\u03b2\n\u03c0\u03b3\u00af(sr)\nz\n\u222b \u03c0\n2\n0\n\u222b \u221e\n\u03b3t\nexp(\u2212f(\u03c6)\u03b3)d\u03b3d\u03c6, (14)\n=\n\u03b2\n\u03c0\u03b3\u00af(sr)\nz\n\u222b \u03c0\n2\n0\nexp(\u2212f(\u03c6)\u03b3t)\nf(\u03c6)\nd\u03c6, (15)\nwhere\nf(\u03c6) =\n\u03b1\n2 cos2 \u03c6\n+\n1\n\u03b3\u00af(sr)\nz\n. (16)\nWe can easily prove the result f(\u03c6) \u0001 f(0). Therefore, the\nconditional probability (15) can be upper bounded by\nPr(em \u0002= 0|\u03b3\n(sr)\nz\n\u0001 \u03b3t) \u0002\n\u03b2 \u00b7 exp(\u2212f(0)\u03b3t)\n2f(0)\u03b3\u00af(sr)\nz\n. (17)\nThen, the very last term to resolve is P(z\u00af), which is related\nto the speci\ufb01c linear combiner. While the direct combiner is\napplied, P(z\u00af) is upper bounded by the EGC performance.\nHowever, the EGC performance is still over complicated\n[13], which cannot help our further analysis. Based on the\ninequality (11), we can employ the looser upper bound (i.e.,\n\u03b3\n(DC)\nz\u00af\n> 0.5\u03b3\n(MRC)\nz\u00af\n) for the performance analysis. While the\nstatistic combiner is applied, we can use the MRC result as\nthe approximate performance. Therefore, the term P(z\u00af) can be\nformulated as\nP(z\u00af) \u0002 E\n(\n\u03b2Q\n(\u221a\n\u03b1\u03be\u03b3(MRC)\nz\u00af\n))\n\u0002 \u03b2\n2\u03b1\u03be\u03b3\u00af(rd)\nz\n\u03b3\u00af(sd)\nz\n, (18)\nwhere \u03be is a scale, i.e., \u03be = 0.5 for the direct combiner, \u03be = 1\nfor the statistic combiner. Replacing all terms in (13) with their\nupper bounds, we can obtain the close-form upper bound for\nP(z) as below\nU(\u03b3t)=\n(\n1\u2212 exp\n(\n\u2212 \u03b3t\n\u03b3\u00af(sr)\nz\n))\n\u03b2\n2\u03b1\u03b3\u00af(sd)\nz\n+ exp\n(\n\u2212 \u03b3t\n\u03b3\u00af(sr)\nz\n)\n\u00b7\n(\n\u03b2 \u00b7 exp(\u2212f(0)\u03b3t)\n2f(0)\u03b3\u00af(sr)\nz\n+\n\u03b2\n2\u03b1\u03be\u03b3\u00af(rd)\nz\n\u03b3\u00af(sd)\nz\n)\n. (19)\nIt can be found that the average-SER is a convex function\nof the threshold \u03b3t. The optimum SNR-threshold can be\nobtained by minimizing U(\u03b3t), i.e., solving the equation\n(\u2202U(\u03b3t))\/(\u2202\u03b3t) = 0, which leads to\n\u03b3\n(opt)\nt =\n1\nf(0)\nln\n(\n\u03b1\u03be\u03b3\u00af\n(sd)\nz\n\u03b3\u00af\n(rd)\nz\n(f(0)\u03b3\u00af\n(sr)\nz\n+ 1)\n(\u03be\u03b3\u00af(rd)\nz\n\u2212 1)\u03b3\u00af(sr)\nz\nf(0)\n)\n. (20)\nFor the moderate and large SNR range, (20) can be simpli\ufb01ed\ninto\n\u03b3\n(opt)\nt \u2248\n1\nf(0)\nln\n(\n\u03b1\u03b3\u00af\n(sd)\nz\n)\n. (21)\nWe can also have the following result\n1\u2212 exp\n(\n\u2212 \u03b3t\n\u03b3\u00af(sr)\nz\n)\n\u2248 \u03b3t\n\u03b3\u00af(sr)\nz\n, exp\n(\n\u2212 \u03b3t\n\u03b3\u00af(sr)\nz\n)\n\u2248 1. (22)\nApplying (21)-(22) into (19) results in\nU(\u03b3t) =\n\u03b2(1 + ln(\u03b1\u03b3\u00af\n(sd)\nz\n))\n2\u03b1\u03b3\u00af(sd)\nz\n\u03b3\u00af(sr)\nz\nf(0)\n+\n\u03b2\n2\u03b1\u03be\u03b3\u00af(rd)\nz\n\u03b3\u00af(sd)\nz\n. (23)\nNow, it is ready to see how the cooperative relay can com-\npensate the performance loss. We consider a simple example,\nwhich compare the single-link coherent BPSK communication\nwith the doubly differential QPSK relaying communication.\nThe reason to choose different modulation scheme is to\nkeep the same bit rate. The average-BER for the coherent\ncommunication is upper bounded by P\n(sd)\nc\n\u0002 (1)\/(4\u03b7\u03b3\u00af(sd)\nz\n).\nAs introduced in [12], the average-BER for the QPSK com-\nmunication is well approximated as P(z)\/2, which is upper\nbounded as\nBER \u0002\n1 + ln(\u03b3\u00af\n(sd)\nz\n)\n2\u03b3\u00af(sd)\nz\n\u03b3\u00af(sr)\nz\nf(0)\n+\n1\n2\u03be\u03b3\u00af(rd)\nz\n\u03b3\u00af(sd)\nz\n. (24)\nThe performance compensation can be satis\ufb01ed for the case\nof the upper-bound ratio (BER)\/(P\n(sd)\nc\n) \u0002 1, which can be\nachieved for the large-SNR range.\nIII. SIMULATION RESULTS\nComputer simulations used the SER to examine the overall\nsystem performance for the proposed doubly differential coop-\nerative communications. The setup for the doubly differential\nmodem is \u03c4 = 1 in (1) and (3). The results were obtained by\naveraging over 100, 000 independent Rayleigh channels. Each\nsymbol block consisted of 256 information-bearing bits, i.e.,\nM = 256 for the BPSK block, and M = 128 for the QPSK\nblock. The normalized CFOs were given by \u03bd(sd) = \u22120.04,\n\u03bd\n(sr)\n= \u22120.03, and \u03bd(rd) = 0.01, respectively. The SNR was\nde\ufb01ned as the total transmitted symbol-energy to noise ratio.\nWith respect to various physical environments, the proposed\nsystem was tested for the following four channel-gain setups.\nFor instance, Case I stands for the equal distance among three\nnodes, Case II for the relay close to the sender, Case III for\nthe relay close to the destination, and Case IV for the relay in\nthe middle.\n646\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The baseline is the\ndoubly differential cooperative communication with the MRC\nat the destination. It is shown that the MRC can offer the\nbest performance for all cases. This phenomenon is in line\nwith our theoretical analysis. On the other hand, both DC\nand SC can offer very close performance with the MRC\nthroughout the whole SNR range. While the relay is close\nto the sender (Case II), all approaches demonstrate the almost\nidentical performance. Another interesting phenomenon is that\nthe DC can provide the almost identical performance with\nthe SC. Therefore, the DC is much favorable in the practical\napplications for its lower receiver complexity.\nThen, we investigate the effect of performance compensa-\ntion using single cooperative relay. In order to provide a clear\nview of the results, we only use the DC as an example to show\nthe performance improvement (see Fig. 3). The theoretical\nupper bound (23) is plotted in Fig. 3, which turns out to\nbe tight for the large-SNR range (> 16 dB). We can see\nthat the system operating in Case II can offer the best SER\nperformance. It can compensate the performance loss at the\nSNR of 23 dB. Moreover, we also examine the performance\nfor the single differential cooperative communications [15].\nAn error \ufb02oor can be observed throughout the whole SNR\nrange.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have investigated the doubly differential\ncooperative communications. For the single-relay case, two\nkind of combiners have been carefully investigated in terms\nof the average-SER performance. It has been shown that the\ncooperative relaying technology could effectively compensate\nthe SNR loss inherent in the doubly differential communica-\ntions.\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n10\u22125\n10\u22124\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\n101\nE\ns\n\/N\no\n (dB)\nSE\nR\nDD BPSK without relay\nCoherent BPSK without relay\nC4, Single Differential\nC3, Single Differential\nC1, DC\nC2, DC\nC3, DC\nC4, DC\nFig. 3.
