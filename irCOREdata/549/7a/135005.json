Introduction \nThe stochastic analysis of structural and mechanical systems subjected to dynamic actions of a \nrandom nature has become very popular in the last decades, given that in a number of engineering \nsituations deterministic approaches are quite unsatisfactory. \nWhen the dynamic excitation is modelled as a Gaussian process, and the system exhibits a \nlinear behaviour, the response is Gaussian too. In this case, then, the knowledge of mean value and \nstandard deviation fully defines the response from a probabilistic point of view. In many \ncircumstances, however, due to a non-linear behaviour of the system, the response may significantly \ndeviate from the Gaussianity, and higher-order statistics are then required. Unfortunately, these are \navailable in exact form just for a restricted class of simple systems: therefore, several approximate \nmethods, with a different degree of complexity and accuracy, have been proposed. Perhaps, the \nmost popular approaches are the methods based on Gaussian and non-Gaussian closure schemes \nand on approximate solutions of the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation, which are well \ncodified in the literature (e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]). Of course, different approaches are also available (e.g. \nthe methods based on the maximum entropy principle and on the dissipation energy balancing) and, \namong these, the Stochastic Averaging (SA) method [6, 7] is applied in this paper in order to \nestimate the mean upcrossing rate and the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the response of a \nSingle-Degree-of-Freedom (SDoF) oscillator with non-linear restoring force under white noise \ninput. \nIt is well known that the mere probabilistic characterization of the response process is not \nsufficient in a reliability analysis. In fact, under the assumption that a vibrating system fails as soon \nas the response firstly exits a given safe domain, the statistics of the first passage time have to be \nestimated, starting from the knowledge of the statistics of the response to the random excitation. \nThis is recognized to be one of the most complicated problem in Computational Stochastic \nMechanics, and no exact solutions have been derived, even in the simplest case of SDoF linear \noscillators under stationary white noise; hence, a number of approximate formulations are available \nin the literature. \nAmong these, the most popular one is the so-called \u201cPoisson approach\u201d (e.g. [3]), in which \nthe response upcrossings of a deterministic threshold are assumed to be statistically independent 3 \nevents. This classical approach, however, proves to be too conservative when the response process \nis narrowband, and\/or when the threshold is not high enough. In these situations, in fact, \nconsecutive upcrossings of the response process cannot be realistically considered as independent \nevents, as they tend to occur in clumps, whose mean size depends on the spectral bandwidth of the \nresponse. The latter, then, has to be somehow accounted for in order to improve the results. \nThe Gaussian Censored Closure (GCC) technique proposed by Senthilnathan and Lutes [8] \nreveals the same bounds, since also in this case the clumping tendency of the response upcrossings \nis neglected. With the purpose of overcoming this drawback, Muscolino and Palmeri [9, 10] \nrecently introduced an expedient \u201ccensorship factor,\u201d which can be directly related to the spectral \nbandwidth of the response process; the use of the Gumbel model as \u201cuncensored\u201d PDF for the peak \nresponse, instead of the Gaussian one, further improves the results. Effectiveness, accuracy and \ncomputational advantages of this technique have been proved in the reliability analysis of linear \nstructures, also in the general case of Multi-Degree-of-Freedom systems subjected to coloured \nnoises [11]. \nAim of this paper is to extend the use of the proposed technique, termed Advanced Censored \nClosure (ACC), to non-linear SDoF oscillators under stationary white noise. The results herein \npresented complement those included in Ref. [12], in which only the case of non-linear damping is \ncoped with. At the best knowledge of the authors, these are the first \u201cconsistent\u201d applications of a \ncensored closure technique in the reliability analysis of non-linear dynamical systems. The only \nexamples found in the literature, in fact, are the pioneering papers by Suzuki and Minai [13, 14] in \nwhich, however, the response of elastoplastic structures is assumed to be Gaussian. \nThe proposed ACC technique is amply illustrated by numerical examples, which \ndemonstrate the superiority with respect to Poisson approach and GCC technique, especially when \nthe response process of the non-linear oscillator is narrowband. \n \n2. Response analysis \nLet us considerer the random vibration of a non-linear SDoF oscillator driven by a zero-mean \nstationary white noise  t W : \n() , += && &\ntt t t mX f X X W (1) 4 \nwhere  t X  is the random process that describes the motion,  0 \u2265 t  is the generic time instant, m  is \nthe inertia,  () , & f xx is the non-linear restoring force, which depends on the instantaneous values of \ndisplacement,  = t X x, and velocity,  = & & t X x, and the over-dot denotes the time derivate. For the \nsimplicity purpose, the restoring force is assumed to be symmetric with respect to the origin of the \nphase plane {,} & x x , i.e.  ( )( ) ,, =\u2212 \u2212 && f xx f x x. As a consequence, in our analyses the mean value of \nthe response process  t X  is zero. \nFrom a probabilistic point of view, the state variables of the system,  t X  and  &\nt X , are \ncharacterized in stationary conditions by the knowledge of the time-independent joint Probability \nDensity Function (PDF),  () , & &\nXX p xx. Given that  ( ) , & f xx is a non-linear function,  () , & &\nXX p xx is non-\nGaussian, and as strong is the non-linearity in the reaction force, as largely the PDF of the response \ndeviates from the Gaussianity. These situations, when the exact solution is not available, the PDF of \nthe response can be estimated via a number of approximate methods known to the literature. \nAmong others, the Stochastic Averaging (SA) method is widely adopted, being versatile and \nquite straightforward [6]. The method, herein applied in the form recently presented in Ref.

Reliability analysis \nLet the first passage time,  1() 0 \u2265 Tb , be the random variable that describes the time instant at which \nthe response process  t X  firstly upcrosses the (Double) D-barrier of level  0 > b , which defines the \nsymmetric safe domain [ , ] \u2212bb. The first passage time, then, satisfies the mathematical conditions: \n1\n11\n1\n()\n() ()\n[0, ( )]\n0\n\u2264\u2200 \u2208\n=\n> &\nt\nTb\nTb Tb\nX bt T b\nXb\nXX\n \nLet the peak response,  0 \u2265 t Y , be the non-stationary random process that describes the \nlargest absolute value of the response over the time interval [0, ] t . The peak response, then, can be \nso defined:  \n{ }\n0 max \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2264\u2264 = t t YX   (6) \nand the samples of  t Y  are monotonic non-decreasing function of the time t. 7 \nOne can easily prove that  1() Tb and  t Y  are complementary random variables (e.g. [11]), as \nthe Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) of these quantities sum up to one:  \n1() () (;) 1 += Tb Y Ft F b t  \nInterestingly, when the safe domain [ , ] \u2212bb is assumed for the response process  t X , the CDF of the \nfirst passage time gives the probability of failure:  \n1 f( ) 1 () () P r () == \u2264 Tb Pt F t Tb t \nwhile the CDF of the peak response gives the reliability, that is the probability of success:  \nf () 1 () (;) P r =\u2212 = = \u2264 Yt R tP t F b tY b  \nwhere the symbol Pr \u22c5  denotes the probability associated with the event into angle brackets. \n \n3.1 Poisson approach \nIn the reliability analysis of dynamical systems excited by random noises no exact solutions have \nbeen derived, even in the simplest case of the stationary vibration of a linear oscillator under white \nnoise. The simplest approximate formulation known to the literature is the so-called Poisson \napproach (e.g. [3]), in which the spectral bandwidth of the response process is neglected. When \napplied to the system under consideration, the method gives the reliability as:  \n[ ] () 2 () 1e x p 2 () \u03bd\n+ \u23a1\u23a4 =\u2212 \u2212 \u23a3\u23a6 XX R tF b b t  \nwhere ( ) X b \u03bd\n+  is the time-independent mean upcrossing rate of the level b  by the response process \nt X : \n0\n() (,) d \u03bd\n+\u221e\n+ = \u222b & && & X XX bx p b x x  (7) \nand  () X F x  is the CDF of  t X . These quantities are directly furnished by the response analysis. \n  Unfortunately, although very simple, the Poisson approach proves to be excessively \nconservative when the response process  t X  is narrowband, e.g. because the system is lightly \ndamped, and\/or when the level b  is not high enough with respect to the standard deviation of the \nresponse, \u03c3 X . In these circumstances, in fact, consecutive upcrossings of the selected D-barrier are 8 \nfar to be independent events, and exhibit the tendency to occur in clumps, whose mean size \nincreases as the spectral bandwidth of  t X decreases (e.g. [16]). What is also important to note is \nthat, even in the case of broadband response process, the mean upcrossing rate of Eq. (7) has to be \neffectively computed, otherwise the reliability given by the Poisson approach may be heavily \ninaccurate. As a consequence, the popular Stochastic Linearization (SL) method (see Appendix) \nshould be avoided in the reliability analysis of non-linear systems, as the accuracy in predicting the \nresponse statistics may be inadequate in practical circumstances. \n \n3.2 Gaussian Censored Closure \nThe Gaussian Censored Closure (GCC) proposed by Senthilnathan and Lutes [8] suffers the same \nlimitations as the Poisson approach, since also in this case the spectral bandwidth of the response \nprocess is not accounted for. The method has been originally applied in the reliability analysis of \nlinear oscillators, but the extension to non-linear oscillators is quite straightforward. \nThe basic idea is to operate a convenient censorship in the joint PDF of the random \nprocesses  t X ,  &\nt X  and  t Y , ( , , ; ) & &\nXXY p xxyt, with the aim of eliminating the probability associated \nwith the impossible event that the absolute value of the response,  t X , overcomes the peak \nresponse,  t Y , in a given time instant, that is:  \nPr 0 >= tt XY  (8) \nIn the formulation by Senthilnathan and Lutes [8] this censorship is obtained with the help of a \nMonte Carlo Simulation (MCS), which is used in each time step in order to evaluate the r.h.s. of the \ndifferential equations ruling the statistical moments of the peak response. The latter can be written \nin the compact form [11]: \n()\n1\n, () E , , , 1 , 2 ,\n\u2212 == & & L\ni\niY t t t t mt iYg X X Y i  (9) \nwhere  , () E =\ni\niY t mt Y is the i-th statistical moment of  t Y , and  ( ) ,, & gxxy is the highly non-linear \nfunction so defined:  \n() () ()\n, sign( ) sign( ) and\n,,\n0 , otherwise\n\u23a7= \u2265 \u23aa =\u2212 = \u23a8\n\u23aa \u23a9\n&&\n&& &\nx xxx y\ngxxy x Ux xU x y   9 \n() \u22c5 U  being the unit step function continuous from the right:  \n0, 0\n()\n1, 0\n< \u23a7\n= \u23a8 \u2265 \u23a9\nx\nUx\nx\n  \nSince the joint PDF  ( , , ; ) & &\nXXY p xxyt is a priori unknown, at a generic time instant t the \nexpectation in the r.h.s. of Eq. (9) cannot be evaluated by the definition:  \n() ()\n11\n0\nE, , , , ( , , ; ) d d d , 1 , 2 ,\nii\ntt t t XXY Y gX X Y y gxxy p xxyt xx y i\n+\u221e +\u221e +\u221e\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u221e \u2212\u221e\n\u23a1\u23a4\n== \u23a2\u23a5\n\u23a3\u23a6 \u222b\u222b \u222b & & && & L (10) \nIn Ref. [8], then, a numerical scheme is proposed, that requires: (i) the generation of a number  s n  of \nthe samples { }\n() () () ,, & jj j\ntt t XXY,  s 1, 2, , = L j n , under the assumption that  ( , , ; ) & &\nXXY p xxyt is jointly \nGaussian; (ii) the satisfaction of Eq. (8) through the substitution of the  j -th sample \n() j\nt Y  with the \nvalue \n() j\nt X  when the generation gives \n() () <\njj\ntt YX ; (iii) the approximate evaluation of the \nexpectation in the r.h.s. of Eq. (9) as:  \n() ()\ns 1 1( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n1\nE, , , , , 1 , 2\n\u2212 \u2212\n=\n\u2245= \u2211 &&\nn\ni ij j j j\ntt t t t t t t\nj\nYg X X Y Y g X X Y i  (11) \nNotice that, because the joint PDF  ( , , ; ) & &\nXXY p xxyt is assumed to be Gaussian, Eq. (11) has to be \nevaluated only for the first two statistical moments,  1, 2 = i . Interestingly, since the peak response \nhas possible values only in the range [0, ) +\u221e , while a Gaussian process has non-zero probability in \nthe entire real axis (,) \u2212\u221e +\u221e , in the paper by Senthilnathan and Lutes [8] two non-linear \ntransformations of  t Y  are also considered, and the consistent definitions of the non-linear function \n() ,, & gxxy are derived. Unfortunately, these transformations do not improve substantially the \naccuracy of the GCC technique. \n \n4. Advanced Censored Closure \nDespite the simplicity of the GCC technique proposed by Senthilnathan and Lutes [8], two main \nflaws may discourage its practical application: (i) the results do not depend on the spectral \nbandwidth of the response process, and then the clump tendency of the response upcrossings is not \naccounted for; (ii) the assumption that the joint PDF  ( , , ; ) & &\nXXY p xxyt is Gaussian may lead to an \nunacceptable degree of inaccuracy, especially in the case of non-linear oscillators. With the aim of 10 \novercoming these two drawbacks, a novel technique, termed Advanced Censored Closure (ACC), \nhas been proposed in the recent papers by Muscolino and Palmeri [9, 10, 11, 12]. In this approach \nthe spectral bandwidth of the response  t X  is taken into account through the so-called \u201ccensorship \nfactor,\u201d unknown before to the literature, and the marginal PDF of the peak response  t Y  is obtained \nby manipulating the Gumbel distribution. \nAbout the first flaw, it would be stressed that even the exact knowledge of the joint PDF \n(,;) XX p xxt & &  at a given time instant t (this is the case, for instance, of linear dynamical systems \ndriven by Gaussian processes) does not include the bandwidth effects, which on the contrary could \nbe appreciated in the time domain through the auto-correlation function of the response process. \nMoreover, about the second flaw, although it could be formally cured with appropriate non-linear \ntransformations, the use of the Gumbel model, also known as the \u201cfirst asymptote of extremes,\u201d \nseems to be preferable from a theoretical point of view. This model, in fact, proves to be the \nasymptotic distribution of the largest value, Y , of an exponentially-distributed random variable,  X  \n(e.g. [17]), and this is precisely the case of the approximate description of the response process  t X  \ngiven by the SA method. On the contrary, the other two asymptotes known to the literature are \ninappropriate in our case: the Fr\u00e9chet model, in fact, can be used when the random variable  X  is \ndescribed by a Cauchy-like distribution, while the Webull model requires that the distribution of the \nrandom variable  X  is bounded in a finite interval. \nIn Ref. [9] it is demonstrated that, without loss of generality, Eq. (9) can be conveniently \nposed in the form:  \n1\n,\n0\n() 2 () () (;) d , 1 , 2 \u03c7\u03bd\n+\u221e\n+\u2212 =\u03a6 = \u222b &\ni\niY X Y mt it b b b tb i  (12) \nwhere  (;) \u03a6Y bt is the so-called \u201cuncensored\u201d CDF of the peak response, and  ( ) \u03c7 t  is the censorship \nfactor, which is bounded in the interval [0,1]. Let us emphasize that Eq. (12) has been simply \nderived by assuming a convenient expression for the joint PDF  ( , , ; ) & &\nXXY p xxyt in Eq. (10), where \nthe only approximation is that the values of the random processes  &\nt X  and  t Y , at a given time instant \nt, are statistically independent. As demonstrated through numerical simulations, the actual effects \nof this assumption are negligible in practical applications, and then Eq. (10) and Eq. (12) can be \nthought to be equivalent (more details can be found in Ref. [9]). 11 \nInstead of the Gaussian model considered in the GCC technique [8], the use of Gumbel \nmodel is suggested in the ACC technique [9, 10, 11, 12] for the uncensored CDF of the peak \nresponse: \n()\n(;) e x p e x p\n()\n\u03b7\n\u03ba\n\u23a7\u23ab \u23a1\u23a4 \u2212 \u23aa\u23aa \u03a6= \u2212 \u2212 \u23a8\u23ac \u23a2\u23a5\n\u23aa\u23aa \u23a3\u23a6 \u23a9\u23ad\nY\nY\nY\nbt\nbt\nt\n (13) \nThe latter depends on the two parameters  () \u03b7Y t  and  () \u03baY t , which account for the position and the \nspread of the probability mass, respectively: \n( ) ( ) 0.5772 ( )\n( ) 0.7797 ( )\n\u03b7 \u00b5\u03ba\n\u03ba\u03c3\n=\u2212\n=\nYY Y\nYY\ntt t\ntt\n \n() \u00b5Y t  and  () \u03c3Y t  being the mean value and the standard deviation of the peak response, given by: \n1,\n2\n2,\n() ()\n() () ()\n\u00b5\n\u03c3\u00b5\n=\n=\u2212\nYY\nYY Y\ntm t\ntm t t\n \nOf course, more accurate results can be obtained by using more sophisticated models for the \nuncensored CDF  (;) \u03a6Y bt , e.g. based on the truncated type-A and type-C Gram-Charlier series \nexpansions (e.g. [18]). In this case, however, the computational effort may excessively increases as \nhigher-order statistics are required, while in the case of the Gumbel model only the first two \nstatistical moments are needed. \nEq. (12) shows that the rate of change of the statistical moments of the peak response \nprocess is proportional to the censorship factor, i.e. as large is  () \u03c7 t , as fast the statistical moments \n, () iY mt  increase, and as conservative are the results: in particular, when the proposed ACC \ntechnique is applied with  () 1 \u03c7 = t  one can prove that the results become consistent with those of the \nPoisson approach. The accuracy is improved when the censorship factor is estimated as the \nexpected value of the semi-empirical correction term,  () \u03b2 b , proposed by Vanmarcke [9] in the \nreliability analysis of stationary Gaussian processes:  \n0\n() E ( ) ( ) ( ;) d \u03c7\u03b2 \u03b2\n+\u221e\n== \u222b tY tY y p y t y  (14) \nwhere:  12 \n()\n()\n1.2\n2\n1 exp 1.253\n()\n1 exp 0.5\nXX\nX\nqb\nb\nb\n\u03c3\n\u03b2\n\u03c3\n\u2212\u2212\n=\n\u23a1\u23a4 \u2212\u2212 \u23a3\u23a6\n \n\u03c3 X  being the standard deviation of the response process, and  X q  being the bandwidth parameter of \nEq. (5). Moreover, in Eq. (14)  (;) Y p yt is the marginal PDF of the peak response at time t, which is \ngiven by:  \n[ ] { } (;) 2 (;) () 0 . 5 (;) (;) () \u03c6 =\u2212 + \u03a6 YY X Y X p yt yt F y yt p yt U y (15) \nwhere  (;) \u03c6Y yt is the uncensored PDF of the peak response: \n1( ) ( )\n(;) (;) e x p e x p\n() () ()\n\u03b7\u03b7\n\u03c6\n\u03ba\u03ba \u03ba\n\u23a7\u23ab \u23a1 \u23a4 \u2202\u2212 \u2212 \u23aa\u23aa =\u03a6 = \u2212 \u23a8\u23ac \u23a2 \u23a5 \u2202 \u23aa\u23aa \u23a3 \u23a6 \u23a9\u23ad\nYY\nYY\nYY Y\nty ty\nyt yt\nyt t t\n \nInterestingly, the PDF of Eq. (15) can be viewed as the combination of two terms: the first one is \nproportional to the PDF of the response process,  (;) X p yt , which gives an essential contribution \nwhen the time t is relatively small, i.e. only in the first cycles of the response process; the second \none is proportional to the uncensored PDF of the peak response,  (;) \u03c6Y yt, whose contribution \nprevails when the time t increases (in particular, in stationary conditions  (;) (;) \u03c6 \u2192 YY p yt yt  as \n\u2192+ \u221e t ). \n  Once Eq. (12), for  1,2 = i , are numerically integrated, the time evolution of the first two \nstatistical moments of the peak response,  1, () Y mt  and  2, () Y mt , are sufficient in evaluating the \napproximate PDF of Eq. (15). An effective numerical scheme of solution, based on the so-called \n\u201cmidpoint\u201d method [19], also known as the second-order Runge-Kutta method, can be found in Ref. \n[11], where the complete flow-chart is displayed and discussed, and where it is also emphasized the \ncomputational efficiency of the proposed ACC technique in comparison with the classical \napproaches. \n  Finally, one can prove that the results of the GCC (without transformations of the random \nprocess  t Y ) are recovered when: (i) in Eq. (12) the censorship factor is assumed to be one,  ( ) 1 \u03c7 = t ; \n(ii) the mean upcrossing rate is that one of the \u201cequivalent\u201d linear system given by the Stochastic \nLinearization (SL) method (Eq. (A.2)); and (iii) the uncensored CDF takes the Gaussian expression:  13 \n1( )\n(;) 1 e r f\n2 2( )\n\u00b5\n\u03c3\n\u23a7\u23ab \u23a1\u23a4 \u2212 \u23aa\u23aa \u03a6= + \u23a8\u23ac \u23a2\u23a5\n\u23aa\u23aa \u23a3\u23a6 \u23a9\u23ad\nY\nY\nY\nyt\nyt\nt\n (16) \nerf( ) \u22c5  being the error function [20]. Notice that the proposed approach allows saving some \ncomputational time with respect to the original formulation by Senthilnathan and Lutes [8], given \nthat the MCS in computing Eqs. (11) is avoided.  \n \n5. Numerical applications \nFor the validation purpose, the Advanced Censored Closure (ACC) technique, summarized in the \nprevious section, is implemented in a simple code running on Mathematica [21], with different \ndegrees of complexity: \n1.  In the first analysis, the censorship factor  ( ) \u03c7 t  is given by Eq. (14), the Stochastic \nAveraging (SA) method is applied in computing the PSD of Eq. (4) and the mean \nupcrossing rate of Eq. (7), and the Gumbel model is considered for the uncensored \ndistribution of the peak response (Eq. (13)): the label \u201cACC\u201d is used for this solution. \n2.  In the second analysis, the only difference with respect to the first one is that the censorship \nfactor takes the constant value  ( ) 1 \u03c7 = t : the label \u201cPoisson\u201d is used for this solution, given \nthat the value  ( ) 1 \u03c7 = t  is consistent with the assumption of independent upcrossings by the \nresponse process. \n3.  In the third analysis, the censorship factor is still  ( ) 1 \u03c7 = t , while the mean upcrossing rate is \nevaluated by the Stochastic Linearization (SL) method (Eq. (A.2)), and the Gaussian model \nis considered for the uncensored distribution of the peak response (Eq. (16)): the label \n\u201cGCC\u201d is used for this solution. \nThe analyses are conducted on oscillators with non-linear stiffness (sub-section 5.1) and damping \n(sub-section 5.2), and the results, in terms of the evolutionary mean value and standard deviation of \nthe peak response, are compared with the statistics from Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), with \ns 500 = n  samples, which is performed with a house code running on MATLAB [22]. 14 \n5.1 Linear-plus-cubic stiffness \nIn a first stage, a SDoF oscillator with non-linear stiffness is considered. The non-linear restoring \nforce in Eq. (1) is modelled as the reaction of an elastic spring with linear-plus-cubic stiffness in \nparallel with a linear viscous dashpot:  \n3\n13 (,) =+ + && f xx kx kx c x  \nin which \n2\n1 1s\n\u2212 = km , \n22\n3 0.1cm s\n\u2212\u2212 = km  and \n1 0.1s\n\u2212 = cm ,  m  being the inertia of the oscillator. \nThe analyses are carried out with three increasing levels of the PSD of the white noise input, \n2\n0 0.1 = Sm , 1.0, \n23 10 cm s\n\u2212 , and the results are displayed in Figs. 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In the \nMCS the excitation is approximated as a pink noise with circular frequency of cut-off \nc 40 rad\/s \u03c9 = , i.e. as a broadband process with uniform PSD of level  0 S  in the interval  c [0, ] \u03c9 . \n  In Fig. 1.a, for the case of \u201clow\u201d level of excitation (\n22 3\n0 0.1cm s\n\u2212 = Sm ), the mean \nupcrossing rates of the response process given by the SA (Eq. (7), solid line) and the SL (Eq. (A.2), \ndot-dashed line) methods are compared, in a logarithmic scale, with that one estimated by MCS \n(circles). In both cases the agreement is quite satisfactory: only at higher levels of the barrier b , in \nfact, the SL method overestimates the actual mean upcrossing rate of  t X . \n  Fig. 1.b shows, in a logarithmic scale, that the approximate PSD of the response process  t X  \ngiven by the SA method (Eq. (4), solid line) compares very closely with the PSD obtained by MCS \n(circles). Each sample of the PSD is computed in the MATLAB code by the function pwelch( ) \u22c5 , \nwhich implements the so-called Welch method [23]. \n  Fig. 1.c plots the mean value of the peak response, \u00b5Y , as a function of the time, t. The \nproposed ACC technique (solid line) is in good agreement with the results of the MCS (circles). \nThe Poisson solution (dashed line) and the GCC technique (dot-dashed line) overestimate the peak \nresponse. This is because the response process,  t X , is narrowband: in fact, the equivalent damping \nratio given by the SL method is  ( ) eq eq eq 2 0.0396 \u03b6 == cm k  (see Appendix), and the bandwidth \nparameter given by the SA method is  0.234 = X q . The accuracy of the ACC technique reduces \nwhen the standard deviation of the peak response, \u03c3Y , is considered (Fig. 1.d). This prediction, \nhowever, is conservative, as the probability of failure,  f P , increases with the standard deviation of \nthe peak response. Moreover, it is worth noting that generally the probability of failure is much 15 \nmore sensitive to the mean value \u00b5Y , which controls the position of the PDF of the peak response \nand which is accurately predicted by the proposed ACC technique, than to the standard deviation \n\u03c3Y , which controls the spread around \u00b5Y . \n  The same results are displayed in Figs. 2 and 3 for the levels of the excitation \u201cmedium\u201d \n(\n22 3\n0 1.0 cm s\n\u2212 = Sm ) and \u201chigh\u201d (\n22 3\n0 10 cm s\n\u2212 = Sm ), respectively. In these cases the deviation of \nthe response process from the Gaussianity increases: this is confirmed by Figs. 2.a and 3.a, in which \nthe mean upcrossing rate given by the SL method (dot-dashed lines), operating under the \nassumption of Gaussianity, deviates from the results of the MCS (circles), while the SA method \n(solid lines) is still in good agreement. On the contrary, some non-negligible differences emerge in \nthe evaluation of the PSD of the response process via the SA method (solid lines). The most \nrelevant portion of these differences is shadowed in Figs. 2.b and 3.b, which prove that in the cases \nof medium and high levels of excitation the SA method (solid lines) overestimates energy content \nand spectral bandwidth of the response process of the non-linear oscillator under consideration. As \na consequence, the accuracy of the proposed ACC technique decreases (see Fig. 2.c and 3.c), \nalthough the advantages of this approach (solid lines) with respect to Poisson solution (dashed \nlines) and GCC technique (dot-dashed lines) persist. Interestingly, the differences among these three \napproaches tend to decrease when the level of excitation increases, although the bandwidth \nparameter is almost constant, being  0.251 = X q  in the second case (\n22 3\n0 1.0cm s\n\u2212 = Sm ) and \n0.257 = X q  in the third case (\n22 3\n0 10 cm s\n\u2212 = Sm ). \n \n5.2 Linear-plus-cubic damping \nIn a second stage, the same analyses as in the previous sub-section are carried out on a SDoF \noscillator in which the non-linear restoring force is modelled as the reaction of a linear elastic spring \nin parallel with a linear-plus-cubic viscous dashpot:  \n3\n13 (,) =++ && & f xx kx cx cx \nin which \n-2 1s = km , \n1\n1 0.01s\n\u2212 = cm , and \n-2\n3 0.001cm s = cm ,  m  being the inertia of the system. \nThe analyses are performed with the same levels of the white noise input considered in the previous 16 \nsub-section, i.e. \n2\n0 0.1 = Sm ,  1.0, \n23 10 cm s\n\u2212 , and the results are displayed in Figs. 4, 5 and 6, \nrespectively. \n  Figs. 4.a, 5.a and 6.a demonstrate the ability of the SA method (solid line) in predicting the \nactual mean upcrossing rate of the response process, estimated by MCS (circles), even when the \nlevel of the excitation is high. Figs. 4.b, 5.b and 6.b demonstrate the same accuracy in estimating \nthe PSD of the response process. Notice that, as opposite to the previous case of non-linearity in the \nstiffness, the bandwidth parameter increases with the level of the input, from  0.135 = X q  when the \nexcitation is low (\n22 3\n0 0.1cm s\n\u2212 = Sm ), to  0.369 = X q  when the excitation is high \n(\n22 3\n0 10 cm s\n\u2212 = Sm ); correspondingly, the equivalent damping ratio given by the SL method is \neq 0.0181 \u03b6 =  when the excitation is low,  eq 0.156 \u03b6 =  when the excitation is high. \n  Figs. 4.c, 5.c and 6.c show that the accuracy of the proposed ACC technique (solid line) in \npredicting the mean value of the peak response is substantially independent of the spectral \nbandwidth of the response process. The Poisson approach (dashed line), on the contrary, \noverestimates the results of the MCS (circles) when the response is more narrowband (Fig. 4.c), \nwhile the GCC technique gives an acceptable estimate only when the response is more broadband \n(Fig. 6.c). Finally, also in the case of non-linear damping the proposed ACC results to be \nconservative in terms of standard deviation of the peak response, and the discrepancy with respect \nto the MCS tends to decrease as the spectral bandwidth of the response process increases (Figs. 4.d, \n5.d and 6.d). \n \n6. Conclusions \nIn the framework of the reliability analysis of dynamical system excited by random processes, the \nAdvanced Censored Closure (ACC) technique has been extended in this paper to the stationary \nvibration of non-linear SDoF oscillators under white noise. \n  The proposed approach enables the statistics of the non-stationary peak response process to \nbe accurately predicted with a moderate computational effort, once mean upcrossing rate and \nspectral bandwidth of the response process are known. The Stochastic Averaging method is applied \nin computing these quantities. 17 \n  The numerical applications to oscillators with non-linear stiffness and damping demonstrate \nthat the ACC technique is very versatile, and that the results are in good agreement with those given \nby Monte Carlo Simulation even when the level of the input increases, and then the response \nprocess deviates from the Gaussianity. The superiority of the proposed approach with respect to the \nclassical Poisson approach, as well as to the more simple Gaussian Censored Closure, is also \nstressed. \n \nAppendix. Stochastic Linearization \nThe Stochastic Linearization (SL) method, widely adopted in practical applications because of its \nsimplicity, substitutes the non-linear restoring force in Eq. (1) with the linear expression:  \n() eq eq eq , =+ && f xx k x c x   \nwhere the \u201cequivalent\u201d values of stiffness and damping,  eq k  and  eq c , are evaluated under the \nassumption that the PDF of the response is Gaussian [1, 24].
