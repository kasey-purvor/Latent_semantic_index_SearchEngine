The NERC-FREE project (CoFEE) and EU FP7 project (MICORE) are \ninvestigating the flood risks in the eastern Irish Sea, an area that includes most of England\u2019s coastal types.  \nUsing a previously modelled and validated historical extreme surge event, in November 1977, we now \ninvestigate the changes in peak surge as a result of possible future climate conditions.  \n \nIn order to simulate the surge, we have set up a one-way nested approach, using the POLCOMS 3D \nbaroclinic model, from a domain covering the whole NW European continental shelf, through to a 1.85km \nIrish Sea model, both areas are forced by tides, atmospheric pressure and winds. We use this modelling \nsystem to investigate the impact of enhanced wind velocities and increased sea levels on the peak surge \nelevation and residual current pattern.  The results show that sea level rise has greater potential to increase \nsurge levels than increased wind speeds.  \n \n1 Introduction \nFuture extreme coastal flooding events are expected to increase (in intensity and frequency) as a result of \nclimate change.  The NERC-FREE Coastal Flooding by Extreme Events (CoFEE) project and EU FP7 \nMorphological Impacts and COastal Risks induced by Extreme storm events (MICORE) project are \ninvestigating past, present and future storm events in Liverpool Bay and especially along the Sefton coastline \n(see Fig.1), where the mobile dunes exposed to the prevailing SW winds and depressions moving across the \nUK from west to east are at risk of enhanced erosion.  The present-day surge conditions due to extreme \nevents are being investigated using wave and surge modelling over an 11 year period (1996-2007). This \npaper uses a hindcast simulation of the November 1977 surge event, which caused significant flooding on the \nSefton coast. We then study the sensitivity of the system by considering changes in the peak surge elevation \nresulting from this storm under future climate conditions.  The future scenarios include increasing the mean \nsea level (by 0.7m and 1.4m) and the wind strength (by 5% and 10%) to look at the new surge levels that \ncould arise in the future. The resulting surges are investigated at ports in the eastern Irish Sea. We present \nresults for Hilbre, Heysham and Douglas (located in Fig. 3).  Hilbre and Heysham represent shallow \nlocations either side of the Sefton coastline, and thus give insight to the surge conditions that may occur \nalong this stretch of coast.  The Liverpool tide gauge had timing errors in its data, which is why we have \nconcentrated on the results at Hilbre and not Liverpool.  The surge results at Douglas have also been \npresented to show how the surge behaves at a deep location within the Liverpool Bay study area.  To allow \ninvestigation of the full picture results are presented for both elevation and velocity.     \n \nThe tide-surge modelling has been improved by implementing the Charnock (1955) method in place of Smith \nand Banke (1975) to calculate the wind surface stress, following Brown and Wolf (2009).  Wu (1982) has \nshown that using a constant Charnock parameter captures most of the variation in surface roughness without \nthe need for including wave effects over a range of winds speeds (0 \u2212 55m\/s), and thus sea states.  Brown and \nWolf (2009) have shown that within the eastern Irish Sea, where the waves are locally generated and shoaling \na constant spatially-uniform Charnock parameter of 0.0185 is adequate for hindcasting surge events.  This \nmethod therefore allows computations to be made without the need for a coupled wave-current model, thus \nlimiting computational costs. \n \nWe use the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal Ocean Modelling System (POLCOMS), as \ndescribed in section 3, as a tide and surge modelling system in a one way nested framework from ~12km to \n1.85km.  A synoptic description of the storm event in November 1977 is given in section 2 and the \nperformance of the modelling system and results are presented in section 4.  Changes in sea level and wind \nforcing have been imposed, in section 5, to investigate future scenarios and provide insight into how the \nimpact of such a severe storm combined with high spring tides might be increased in the future.  The research \nconcentrates mainly on surge elevation, but the residual surge current patterns are also briefly investigated. \nWe discuss the results in section 6 followed by the conclusions in section 7.   \n1 \n \n2 The November 1977 surge \nWe revisit the surge of November 1977, a storm event which caused damage on the Sefton coast in NW \nEngland. This period has previously been thoroughly studied e.g. Jones and Davies (1998). The surge \noccurred on the 11th \u221212th November and was the result of an atmospheric depression crossing the region \nfrom west to east to the north of Scotland before moving on to northern Norway.  This generated 16m\/s \nsouth-westerly winds in the eastern Irish Sea, which increased to 22m\/s and veered round to the west (Fig. 1) \n(Jones and Davies, 1998).  The surge reached 1.5m at Liverpool (Fig. 2), while wave heights were of the \norder 3.5m with 6s periods. The external surge was generated by winds blowing over the south-west Irish Sea \n(Fig. 1a) and the local surge was generated by winds blowing over the eastern Irish Sea (Fig. 1b).  This \nsevere storm coincided with high water spring tide (Fig. 2) leading to severe flooding as water overtopped \ncoastal defences throughout Merseyside, Lancashire and Cumbria. We assume that the worst flooding will \noccur due to any amount of positive surge at high water elevation, especially during spring tides.  This event \nis used to investigate how the surge component is modified under future scenarios.   \na) b)\nU10\n \nFig. 1 The 10m wind velocity (m\/s) at a) 12:00 11th November 1977 and b) 00:00 12th November 1977 \n \n2 \n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\nE\nle\nv\na\nti\no\nn\n,\nm\nNovember 1977  \nFig. 2 The total (surge + tide) elevation (\u2212\u25cf\u2212), tidal elevation (\u2212 \u2212) and surge elevation (\u2212) at Hilbre during \nthe November 1977 event.  The time resolution is the day in November, e.g. 10 = 00:00 10th \nNovember and 10.5 = 12:00 10th November  \n  \n \n3 Methods \nIn order to accurately simulate the external surge-tide effects generated outside of the Irish Sea a one-way \nnested approach  from a 1\/9\u00ba latitude by 1\/6\u00ba longitude (~12km) model of the whole NW European \ncontinental shelf, over which surges impacting the UK are generated, to the 1.8km Irish Sea model has been \napplied.  For the 1977 surge event the POLCOMS (Holt and James, 2001) Atlantic margin model (Fig. 3) \nwas used to provide the boundary forcing.  In the Irish Sea the standard Smith and Banke surface drag \nformulation for wind stress (1975), hereafter referred to as S&B, has been replaced by the Charnock (1955) \nmethod to better simulate the surge event following Brown and Wolf (2009). The surge is defined as the \ndifference in the total simulated water level and the modelled tide, i.e. the residual water level due to \nmeteorological forcing.  Here, the modelled tide was simulated using the 15 tidal constituents (Q1, O1, P1, S1, \nK1, 2N2, \u00b52, N2, \u03bd2, M2, L2, T2, S2, K2 and M4) available in POLCOMS. A minimum water depth of 5m was \napplied, to avoid treating wetting and drying conditions.  Brown and Wolf (2009) discuss using the predicted \ntide combined with the surge simulation to assess the flood risk using the total water level and the \u2018skew \nsurge\u2019 to remove inaccuracy in the modelled tide. The \u2018skew surge\u2019 is defined as the difference between the \npredicted high tide and the actual high water level due to the tide and surge.  \n \n3 \n7\no\nW 6\no\nW 5\no\nW 4\no\nW 3\no\nW\n51\no\nN\n52\no\nN\n53\no\nN\n54\no\nN\n55\no\nN\n56\no\nN\nLongitude\nL\na\nti\ntu\nd\ne\n-200\n-180\n-160\n-140\n-120\n-100\n-80\n-60\n-40\n-20\n0\n16\no\nW 8\no\nW 0\no\n8\no\nE\n40\no\nN\n45\no\nN\n50\no\nN\n55\no\nN\n60\no\nN\no\nLongitude\nL\na\nti\ntu\nd\ne\nAM\nIRS\n65 N\nCumbria\nLancashire\nMerseyside\nWirral\nDepth, m\n(MSL)\n \nFig. 3 The Irish Sea model domain and the coastal tide gauges used to validate the surge elevation predicted \nby the modelling system, during November 1977 (+). The nested model domains for the Atlantic \nMargin model (AM) and the Irish Sea model (IRS) are shown in the bottom right corner  \n \nThe coarse grid models for POLCOMS were driven by 1\u00ba resolution ECMWF (ERA-40) atmospheric \npressure and wind data provided every 6 hours.  For the medium resolution Irish Sea model high resolution \n(both spatially, 1\/2\u00ba by 1\/3\u00ba, and temporarily, 3 hourly) wind and pressure data (Jones & Davies, 1998) were \nused to drive the model.  The improved resolution of these data allows a more accurate simulation of the \nsurge conditions in 1977. Surge elevation data obtained at five coastal tide gauges (Fig. 3) in the eastern Irish \nSea during this event have been used to validate the model.   \n \n3.1 Surface roughness  \nTo accurately predict surge conditions in the eastern Irish Sea different methods to predict the surface wind \nstress have been applied.  Wind stress, \u03c4, is dependent on the air density, \u03c1a, and friction velocity, u*, which is \nrelated to the wind speed at 10m, U10, where CD = a drag coefficient (Janssen, 2004): \n2\n10\n2\n* UCu Daa \u03c1=\u03c1=\u03c4                                                   (1) \nCharnock\u2019s (1955) method parameterises the roughness length, z0, on dimensional grounds and has been \nfound to be applicable from light to extreme (hurricane) wind conditions up to 60m\/s (Wu, 1982).  By \nassuming momentum transfer from air to ocean is mainly through short surface gravity waves, then the \nroughness length is scaled by the acceleration of gravity, g, and u\n*\n: \ng\nuz\n2\n*\n0\n\u03b1=                                       (2) \nThe Charnock parameter, \u03b1, is often treated as constant in models with values between 0.0112 and 0.035 \n(Wu, 1980).  Although \u03b1 = 0.0185 seems to provide accurate representation of the surface stress for all sea \nstates (Wu, 1982), a larger constant value (0.0275) has also been found to be appropriate for surge modelling \nand is applied in the UK operational surge model (Williams and Flather, 2000).  To model the surface drag to \naccurately predict the surge events both the methods of Smith and Banke (1975) (S&B) and Charnock (1955) \nwere previously investigated.  Three constant Charnock parameters have been used.  The first (\u03b1=0.0275) \n4 \nwas found to give good surge prediction in the operational surge model over the whole UK shelf (Williams \nand Flather, 2000). The second (\u03b1=0.0144) was that used by Janssen (1989) to model the impacts of waves \non the surface roughness. The third (\u03b1=0.0185) was found by Wu (1982) to give good surface stress \nprediction for all sea states (wind conditions).  Brown and Wolf (2009) found the optimum constant and \nspatially uniform value for the eastern Irish Sea to be 0.0185 although this might be dependent on model \nresolution. Local modulation by wave age effects may provide some further improvement but this is not very \nsignificant in the eastern Irish Sea.  We therefore use this Charnock constant to simulate the future scenario \nsurge conditions investigated here.   \n \n4 Results \n4.1 Hindcast surge elevation \nIn the following results, observed data at Heysham and Hilbre stop just after peak surge due to the tide \ngauges being damaged during the following tidal high water combined with the weakening but still \nsignificant surge levels.   \n \nComparison of the surge elevation at coastal tide gauges across in the eastern Irish Sea (located in Fig. 3) has \nshown that there is significant tidal modulation in the surge (Fig. 2). The times of high water compared to the \npeaks in surge are shown in Figs. 2 and 4, where it may be seen that the peak surge residual occurs on the \nrising tide (i.e. approximately 3 hours before HW). The large (10m) tidal range in the eastern Irish Sea has \nsignificant effect on the depth-averaged surge generated by the wind stress in shallow coastal locations. The \nlocally generated peaks in surge occur at low water levels when the water depths are shallowest, but tide-\nsurge interaction due to tide and surge propagation means the peak surge occurs on rising tide (Horsburgh \nand Wilson (2007); Wolf, 1981). The data (Fig. 4) also shows that the surge is much greater (~1m) along the \nSefton coast (Heysham and Hilbre) compared with that occurring on the Isle of Man (Douglas).  The higher \nconstant value (\u03b1 = 0.0275) was found to be more accurate at capturing the peak surge at the deep tide gauge \nlocations compared to the lower value (\u03b1 = 0.0144), and visa versa for the shallow tide gauge locations (Fig. \n4).  On average across the eastern Irish Sea the intermediate constant (\u03b1 = 0.0185) was found to most \naccurately model the peaks in tide-surge conditions (Fig. 4).  Fig. 5 shows how the surge predicted using a \nCharnock method with \u03b1 = 0.0144, is very similar to that predicted by S&B.  For this model resolution S&B \nslightly under predicts the surge peaks, but still gives a reasonable prediction, unlike the predictions when \nusing a coarse resolution model (Williams and Flather, 2000).  Figures 4 and 5 show that a Charnock method \nwith constant value of 0.0185 is the most appropriate method over time to simulate the surface roughness in a \ntide-surge model of the eastern Irish Sea, instead of the S&B methods.  \n \n5 \n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nDouglas\n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nHeysham\nS\nu\nrg\ne\nE\nle\nv\na\nti\no\nn\n,\nm\n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n0\n0.5\n1\nHilbre\nNovember 1977\nHW HWHW\nHW HWHW\nHW HWHW\n \nFig. 4 Surge prediction using Charnock parameters of 0.0275 (+), 0.0185 (\u25cf) and 0.0144 (\u00d7), using \nPOLCOMS with a minimum depth of 5m, compared to tide gauge data (\u2212).

The time resolution is the day \nin November, e.g. 10 = 00:00 10th November and 10.5 = 12:00 10th November  \n   \n \n4.2 Simulated flow patterns \nAlthough it is the water elevation that controls the extent of coastal flooding, future changes in the magnitude \nand extent of the current field in relation to the coast will modify natural defences and the beach profile along \na coastline.  In particular, the Sefton coastline has a vast extent of sand dunes and salt marsh providing a \nsignificant amount of protection at present.  We therefore investigate the possible future changes in depth-\naverage current at the coastal tide gauge locations.   \n \nIn the eastern Irish Sea the tide is asymmetric.  The depth-averaged flow vectors are shown every 2 hours for \nDouglas, Heysham and Hilbre in Fig. 6.  At Douglas, the deepest location, the tide is rectilinear with the \nflood tide directed in a (positive) northeast direction and ebb tide in a (negative) southwest direction.  This \nrectilinear velocity pattern is a result of the coastline configuration in relation to the tide in the eastern Irish \nSea.  Interestingly although the flood tide is of shorter duration the peak ebb tide is a few cm\/s faster.  At \nHeysham, a shallow location away from the influence of an estuary mouth, the tide is nearly rectilinear with \nthe flood tide and ebb tide in the same direction as Douglas.  Here, the flood tide is faster than the ebb as in \ntypical flood tide asymmetry (short, fast flood and long slow ebb), but both are of similar strength to the \ncurrents at Douglas.  At Hilbre, a shallow location in the mouth of the Dee Estuary, the tide is less rectilinear \nand floods towards the south (negative) and ebbs towards the north (positive).   In this location the typical \n7 \n(for shallow water) flood tide asymmetry occurs, comprising of a significantly faster, shorter flood tide \ncompared with the ebb.  The flood tide at Hilbre is slightly weaker than that at Douglas and Heysham, while \nthe ebb is much faster.    \n \n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\nDouglas\n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\nHeysham\nT\nid\ne\nV\ne\nlo\nc\nit\ny,\nm\n\/s\n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5 Hilbre\nNovember 1977  \n \nFig. 6 Tide only depth \u2013 averaged current vectors every 2 hours at Douglas, Heysham and Hilbre, located in \nFig. 3, during the period 10th November (12:00) to 12th November (12:00) 1977.  The time resolution \nis the day in November, e.g. 10 = 00:00 10th November and 10.5 = 12:00 10th November  \n  \n \n5 Future scenarios \nWe used the November 1977 storm as our base storm to simulate future scenarios using combinations of (i) \nincreased winds (by 5% and 10%) and (ii) increased sea level (by 0.7m and 1.4m).  To simulate the effects of \nincreased sea level the mean tidal level in the model was raised.  Any non-linear effects due to tide-surge \ninteraction in the deepened water are therefore captured.  Since the surge is defined as the additional water on \ntop of the tidal level we remove the present day tidal level from the future total water levels to compare the \nsurge directly with present day tidal conditions.  The rise in sea level at Liverpool is currently 1.4mm\/year \n(Woodworth et al, 1999); if rates remain constant these increased sea levels are unlikely to be achieved in the \nnext 100 years. It is thought sea level rise will be of the order of meters over the next 15 to 100 years due to \nthermal expansion alone (ICPP, 2007), we therefore investigate multiples of 1.4mm\/year to represent a sea \nlevel rise of this magnitude.  These future scenarios have been simulated to give insight into what might \noccur in the future.  The external surge important to the eastern Irish Sea is generated in the Celtic Sea and \nalso enters from NW Approaches through the North Channel (Jones and Davies, 1998).  These regions are \nincluded within the Irish Sea model used here; we have therefore not modified the boundary conditions to \n8 \nthis model but allowed the external surge to the eastern Irish Sea to be changed as a result of increased wind \nforcing and sea level rise across the Irish Sea model domain.   \n \n5.1 Future surge elevations \nWe focus on three tide gauge locations, namely Douglas, Hilbre and Heysham.  These three locations show \nthe main changes in the surge along the Sefton coast and also at a deep and shallow coastal position.  The \npercentage change in the peak surge elevation for Douglas (0.668m peak surge), Heysham (1.673m peak \nsurge) and Hilbre (1.242m peak surge) are given in Table 1 and 2 respectively. Under all future scenario \nconditions the peaks in surge increase. The increase is much greater at the shallow locations compared to the \ndeeper location. For the changes in sea level and wind speed we have de-tided the total water elevation to \nobtain the surge using the present day tide (sea levels).  This allows us to see the total increase in surge \nelevation as a result of changes in the tide, surge and tide-surge interaction.  The changes in sea level have \nmore impact than the change in wind speed on the enhancement of the peak surge (Tables 1 \u2013 3).  As \nexpected the combined effect of increasing the wind speed and sea level led to the worst increase in peak \nsurge. For shallow coastal locations such as Hilbre only a small increase in sea level (+0.7m) causes a \nsignificant (15%) enhancement in the peak surge.  Along the Sefton coast stronger winds enhanced the surge \nby a more significant amount at Heysham (Table 2) compared with Hilbre (Table 3), while sea level rise has \nless impact at Heysham compared with Hilbre. For this area Lowe et al. (2001) also concluded that sea level \nrise would have more significant impact on the peak surge than changes in meteorological forcing.    \n \n Increase in U10\nSea level rise 0% 5% 10% \n0m - 1.92 4.01 \n0.7m 4.29 6.26 8.40 \n1.4m 9.295 11.27 13.41 \nTable 1 Percentage change in peak surge elevation at Douglas.

The 1977 peak surge reached 1.242m \n \n \nFig. 7 shows how increased sea level modifies the surge.  At both the shallow (Hilbre and Heysham) and \ndeep (Douglas) locations the amplitude of the surge peaks is increased, due to higher peak surge elevations \nand lower minimum surge elevation.  This can be attributed to changes in the tide and bottom friction \naffecting the tide-surge interaction, which controls the modulation of the surge.  The total water level at high \nwater determines the extent of coastal flooding. At high water levels the surge may be reduced due to \nincreased sea level (lower minimum surge elevations in Fig. 7), but the increase in total water levels due to \nsea level rise will still pose more frequent flood risk (Lowe et al, 2001).  Surprisingly there is also a phase \nshift in the surge at Douglas, the deeper location, such that it occurs later.  The timing of the peak in total \nwater level is consistent for varying sea levels at this location.  The lag in surge peak is thought to be related \nto modified tide-surge interaction as a result of sea level rise also modifying the tides at this location. \n \n9 \n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nDouglas\n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nHeysham\nS\nu\nrg\ne\nE\nle\nv\na\nti\no\nn\n,\nm\n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nHilbre\nNovember 1977  \nFig. 7 The surge prediction at Douglas, Heysham and Hilbre for present day conditions (\u2212) and with sea level \nrises of 0.7m (\u25cf) and 1.4m (+).

The increased wind causes the surge to achieve higher elevations throughout the event, \ni.e. the curve is shifted to higher elevations in Fig. 8.  This shift is greater the larger the surge elevation, i.e. \nthe peaks in surge during low water levels undergo greater enhancement.    \n \n10 \n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nDouglas\n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nHeysham\nS\nu\nrg\ne\nE\nle\nv\na\nti\no\nn\n,\nm\n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nHilbre\nNovember 1977  \nFig. 8 The surge prediction at Douglas, Heysham and Hilbre for present day conditions (\u2212) and with \nenhanced wind speeds of 5% (\u25cf) and 10% (+).

At all locations the increased water depth increases the peak surge and reduces the minimum \nsurge levels.  Enhanced winds combined with sea level rise increases the surge height throughout the \nsimulation compared to that in which only the sea levels are increased.  This shift is greater for the peaks in \nsurge and is most significant at Hilbre, the shallowest estuarine location.    \n11 \n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nDouglas\n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nHeysham\nS\nu\nrg\ne\nE\nle\nv\na\nti\no\nn\n,\nm\n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nHilbre\nNovember 1977  \nFig. 9 The surge prediction at Hilbre and Douglas for present day conditions (\u2212), present day conditions with \nenhanced wind speeds of 10% (\u25cf) and 1.4m sea level rise (+), and combined 1.4m sea level rise and \n10% wind enhancement (\u00d7).  The time resolution is the day in November, e.g. 10 = 00:00 10th \nNovember and 10.5 = 12:00 10th November  \n \n \n5.2 Future residual flow patterns \nWe now look at the effect of the surge on the residual depth-averaged velocities at the same three locations as \nin section 5.1.  We initially analyse the effects of future conditions at Douglas, the deeper coastal location.  \nFigure 10 shows that the trend in magnitude (length) of the residual surge current vectors through time has \nthree distinct peaks, like the residual surge elevation.  At this deep location the residual flow is generally in a \nnorthwest direction, i.e. in the flood tide direction.  Since the wind direction is south westerly until mid-day \non the 11th November when it veers west, the residual surge is driven by the winds across the Irish Sea. The \nresidual magnitude is modulated by the tide, causing weaker velocities to occur at times of high water (Fig. \n4) and greater velocities at low water.  Although the magnitude of the residual increases with wind velocity \nthe direction remains constant in the direction of the wind during the initial stages of the surge.  This \ndemonstrates that the duration of the wind in a particular direction is important at this location, veering in the \nwind takes time to impact the residual surge currents.  For this location an increase in the wind velocity by \n10% (bottom panel, Fig. 10) had greater impact on the magnitude of the residual velocity than increasing the \npresent day sea level by 1.4m (top panel, Fig. 10).   \n12 \n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n0\n0.1\n0.2 Douglas\nS\nu\nrg\ne\nV\ne\nlo\nc\nit\ny,\nm\n\/s\n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n0\n0.1\n0.2 Douglas\nS\nu\nrg\ne\nV\ne\nlo\nc\nit\ny,\nm\n\/s\nNovember 1977  \nFig. 10 Surge (residual)  depth \u2013 averaged current vectors every 2 hours at Douglas, located in Fig. 3, during \nthe period 10th November (12:00) to 12th November (12:00) 1977.  The vector arrows depicted with \ndotted end points represent the actual 1977 surge conditions, while the arrows depicted by crossed end \npoints represent the 1977 surge under future scenario conditions as follows: In the top panel a 1.4m \nsea level rise is included and in the bottom panel a 10% increase in wind speed is included.  The time \nresolution is the day in November, e.g. 10 = 00:00 10th November and 10.5 = 12:00 10th November  \n     \n \nAt Heysham (Fig. 11), a shallow location at the northern end of the Sefton coast, the residual surge velocity \nis often in the counter direction to the tidal flow and not determined by the wind direction as at Douglas (Fig. \n10).  The largest residuals occur around high water (Fig. 4) as the tide turns.  Similarly to Hilbre (Fig. 12), the \neffect of a 1.4m sea level rise has more impact (top panel, Fig. 12) on the enhancement of the residual \nvelocities than a 10% increase in the wind velocity (bottom panel, Fig. 11).  The increase in sea level also \ncauses a slight change in the direction of the residual current at certain times of the tide.      \n \n \n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4 Heysham\nS\nu\nrg\ne\nV\ne\nlo\nc\nit\ny,\nm\n\/s\n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4 Heysham\nS\nu\nrg\ne\nV\ne\nlo\nc\nit\ny,\nm\n\/s\nNovember 1977  \nFig. 11 Surge (residual)  depth \u2013 averaged current vectors every 2 hours at Heysham, located in Fig. 3, during \nthe period 10th November (12:00) to 12th November (12:00) 1977.

At this shallow location in the \nmouth of the Dee Estuary, the residual surge velocity is generally out of the estuary (in a positive direction).  \nThe residual flow pattern does not follow the same trends as the surge.  Contrary to the results for Douglas \n(Fig. 10), the largest residual occurs close to high water (Fig. 4) and is a factor of 2 greater than the peak \nresidual velocity at Douglas.  For Hilbre this is also the time for peak flood flow.  For all other states of the \ntide the residual is weaker than at Douglas and Heysham.  Again the effect of a 1.4m sea level rise (top panel, \nFig. 12) leads to greater enhancement of the residual velocities and also causes a slight change in the \ndirection of the residual current at certain times of the tide.  The 10% increase in the wind velocity (bottom \npanel, Fig. 12) has less effect than the change in sea level. \n  \n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4 Hilbre\nS\nu\nrg\ne\nV\ne\nlo\nc\nit\ny,\nm\n\/s\n10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4 Hilbre\nS\nu\nrg\ne\nV\ne\nlo\nc\nit\ny,\nm\n\/s\nNovember 1977  \nFig. 12 Surge (residual)  depth \u2013 averaged current vectors every 2 hours at Hilbre, located in Fig. 3, during \nthe period 10th November (12:00) to 12th November (12:00) 1977.

We \nalso notice that the S&B prediction is quite valid in the Irish Sea (~1.8km) model, although it under-predicts \nwhen applied in the POL operational model.  It is thought that the model resolution plays an important role in \nthe optimum value for the Charnock parameter and the validity of the S&B procedures.  As the model grid \nbecomes more highly resolved the average depth within each coastal grid cell is more accurately resolved.  In \nlow resolution models the average depth of the large grid cells may be greater in coastal zones compared with \nhigh resolution models.  This greatly influences the effect of the surface stress on the water column. For low \nmodel resolution the stress must therefore be enhanced for accurate surge prediction at the coast.  This \nenhancement is reduced with improved grid resolution and the S&B method becomes more accurate.   \n \nInterestingly the residual surge velocity at Douglas occurs in the direction of the wind with longest duration \nacross the Irish Sea.  At Hilbre the residual is often in the direction of the northerly wind component, but can \nbe into the estuary as the tide turns from ebb to flood.  This could be the result of the enhanced water levels \nduring the rising tide (Fig. 4) changing the tidal forcing at the estuary mouth.  Although open-ocean Ekman \ndynamics should lead to a residual flow at 90\u00ba to the right of the wind direction (Gill, 1982), this is not \nobserved in the eastern Irish Sea.  The residuals seem to generally be in the wind direction, due to the strong \ntidal currents and shallow (<50m) depths in the eastern Irish Sea.  For the peak wind velocity of 22m\/s the \nEkman depth is estimated to be 186m.  The strong tidal currents also create a large vertical eddy viscosity \nprofile and turbulent mixing preventing the formation of Ekman currents.  Time varying winds (in strength \nand direction) during a real surge event also prevent a residual depth-averaged Ekman current pattern \nforming in the period of the surge.  This is why significant surges are generated by winds over greatest fetch \ntowards the eastern Irish Sea rather than alongshore winds in the eastern Irish Sea.  \n \n14 \nThe effect of waves on the surge events has also been investigated (Brown and Wolf, 2009).  They find that \nthe inclusion of a wave-dependent Charnock parameter has minimal difference compared with that using a \nconstant value of 0.0185.  An 11year simulation (1996 to 2007) following this model validation and that of \nBrown and Wolf (2009) is now underway to allow us to now investigate what storm conditions (wind and \nwave directions and strengths) pose the most significant threat to the Sefton coastline.  This will enable a \nrange of storm conditions to be tested under future scenario conditions and will provide a complete study of \npast, present and future extreme events for the Sefton coast.   \n \nWe have found that for the 1977 storm conditions increased sea level has more impact on the increase in \npeak surge elevation than increased wind speeds.  This result was also found by McInnes et al. (2009).  The \ncombined effect of these two changes can lead to a 20% to 40% increase in the peak surge relative to the \npresent-day surge conditions on the coastal areas around Wirral, Merseyside and Sefton.  The surge elevation \nalong Sefton coast increases with distance to the north by about half a meter.  Compared with Douglas (a \ndeep location on the Isle of Man) the surge is much greater (nearly 1m) at shallow location along the Wirral, \nMerseyside and Sefton, coastline.  When planning defences the total (tide + surge) water level is of most \ninterest. Table 4 shows the percentage change in the peak of the total water level during the surge, which \nshould be taken into account by managers.  At Douglas the rise in sea level has more impact than the increase \nin wind speed, but the opposite is true for Heysham and Hilbre.  Sea level rise has most impact on the surge \npeaks (during low water levels) (Fig. 7), while the winds influence the surge throughout the investigated time \nperiod (Fig. 8). Changes in the wind seem to have greater affect at the shallower locations (Table 4).  At all \nlocations the combined change is approximately the same as the linear addition of the percentage changes \ndue to sea level and enhanced wind speeds.  Although the surge at Hilbre is significantly large, the \nconsequent flooding due to the total water level does not pose extreme risk to the coastal population, since \nthere is an extensive volume of salt marsh, which will be flooded within the estuary before nearby towns \nbecome at risk.  The size of the surge at high water along the Sefton coastline does pose a risk to the coastal \npopulation, as many towns are located on low lying land, e.g. Southport is built on reclaimed land.  Along \nthis coast the defences are in the form of naturally developed sand dune, which under future climate may \nbecome eroded by both the sea and wind.  Not only does the increased surge elevation allow the dunes to be \neroded and breached but the enhanced currents under future climate conditions will also scour the base of the \ndune system and alter the beach profile.    \n \n \nFuture Change Douglas Heysham Hilbre \n+10% wind increase 1.35% 2.55% 2.20% \n+1.4m sea level rise 1.88% 0.45% 1.48% \nBoth the above 3.20% 3.04% 3.53% \nTable 4 Percentage change in peak total water elevation at the study locations.  The observed peak total \nwater level at Douglas, Heysham and Hilbre were: 4.08m, 5.49m and 5.13m respectively  \n \n \n7 Conclusions \nThe November 1977 storm surge events has previously been used to tune and validate the POLCOMS model \nsurge predictions in the eastern Irish Sea, using this nested modelling system.  We have shown that although \nthe Smith and Banke formula under-predicts the peak surge, the Charnock method can be tuned to accurately \npredict a surge event at a given location.  We find that the optimum Charnock value (0.0185) is lower than \nthat found by Williams and Flather (2000) (0.0275).  This may be due to the higher model resolution that is \napplied here to the Irish Sea. \n \nFuture scenarios in the eastern Irish Sea have shown sea level rise combined with stronger winds will both \nsignificantly enhance the peak surge, perhaps, up to 40%.  This enhancement is greatest in shallow locations \nalong the Sefton coastline, e.g. Hilbre and Heysham.  We have shown that sea level rise has more impact \nthan changing wind strength on the surge elevation, and thus greater potential for flood risk.  Even if the \nwind speeds do not change significantly in the future a 0.7m increase in sea level, which is likely to occur in \nthe next 100 years, will enhance the surge elevation by up to 15%.  We can be certain that extreme storm \nconditions of today that cause large surge events along the Sefton coastline will have enhanced surge peaks \nin the future as further sea level rise is now inevitable (although the magnitude is uncertain  e.g. IPCC, 2007). \nDefences along the Sefton coastline will therefore have to be carefully planned for future conditions \ninvolving storms combined with sea level rise.   \n \nFor study, at Douglas the wind speed and duration has most influence on the surge velocities.  The residual \nsurge direction is controlled by the wind direction, while the strength is modulated by the tide.  Future \nincreases in wind velocity will have more potential to increase the current strength at Douglas than increase \n15 \nsea level. At Heysham the residual surge velocity varies in direction due to interaction with the tide and \ncoastline.  We find that for this location sea level has greater effect on the increase in the surge currents than \nincreased wind speeds.  At Hilbre the residual surge is generally out of the estuary due to the wind, increased \nsea levels rather than enhanced wind velocities pose greater risk with regard to faster surge currents. \n \nFrom this study we can conclude that future changes in wind strength and sea level will lead to increased \nsurge elevations and velocities.  The enhancement of the peak velocity and elevation residuals will be \ngreatest at shallow coastal locations.  This will pose a threat to the sand dunes along the Sefton coast that act \nas a natural defence against surge events.      \n \nAcknowledgments \nThis research is part of the NERC FREE CoFEE (grant NE\/E002471\/1) and the EU FP7 MICORE (grant \n202798) projects.
