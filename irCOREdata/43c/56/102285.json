We analyse the waveguide geometry in optical modulators and filters \nto address some issues associated with this trend. \n \n \nSilicon photonics has experienced rapid development for the last three years and several significant \nresults have been reported, demonstrating the viability of the technology [e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4]. One of the \nrecent trends in silicon photonics has been the reduction of waveguide dimensions. This reduction \nfacilitates tighter bending radii and therefore a smaller device footprint which in turn, significantly \nreduces the cost. Furthermore, technical performance of many silicon photonic devices is enhanced. \nHowever, there are also some issues with this trend to smaller dimensions, notably increased \npropagation losses, increased polarisation dependence and difficulty in coupling to\/from optical fibres. \nThese issues can be overcome with a careful design of the waveguide and device geometry.  \nWe have previously shown that by reducing waveguide dimensions, multi-GHz bandwidth optical \nmodulators can be achieved by utilising a horizontal pn junction in a waveguide with an overall height \nof 450 nm [5]. Although the waveguide structure of these previous devices has been designed to \napproach birefringence-free propagation, the fact that the pn junction is horizontal introduces a \ndifference between the phase shifts for TE and TM polarisations, and hence the device itself is not \npolarisation independent.  \nIn order to improve the polarisation performance to approach polarisation independence of the \nmodulator, we propose here a modulator with a pn junction that is a V-shape structure, as shown in \nFigure 1. The V-shape is based on the natural etch angle of silicon (54.7 degrees). The operation of the \nmodulator is similar to that presented in [5] in that it is based upon a pn junction. If the rib waveguide \nis polarisation independent, by varying the height of the V-shaped pn junction in the rib, it is now \npossible to achieve an identical phase shift for TE and TM polarisations.  \n \n \n \nHighly doped \nsilicon \nSilicon \ndioxide \nHighly doped \nsilicon \nHighly doped \nsilicon \nFigure 1.

The p-type \nsilicon is situated in the top region of the rib waveguide, and the n-type region is in the slab region. The \nangled V-shape increases the effective length of the pn junction as well as allowing it to affect TE and \nTM polarisations in a similar way. Because the natural etch angle of silicon is not 45o, the additional \nflexibility of vertical adjustment of the V-structure allows sufficient flexibility to equalise the TE and \nTM phase responses. The doping profiles of the p and n regions facilitate an increased depletion of the \np-type region compared to the n-type, in the centre of the optical mode, maximising the change in \neffective index. Consequently, the concentration of n-type carriers in the waveguide can be reduced, \nhence decreasing the losses in the waveguide. \nReducing device dimensions can also be beneficial for other devices. An obvious example is the \nring resonator based optical filter. It is also clear that rib waveguides offers better control for satisfying \nboth single mode and polarisation independent propagation [6]. We have already shown that \npolarisation independent ring resonator filters based upon relatively small rib waveguides can be \nachieved [7]. However, the main limitation of a rib waveguide with cross sectional dimensions of the \norder of 1 \u00b5m, is loss in resonator bends when the radius of the curvature is of the order of 10 \u00b5m or \nless. This is a significant restriction because maximising the Free Spectral Range (FSR), which is of \ngreat importance in filters, requires a small device circumference and, therefore, bend radii as small as \npossible. \n Strip waveguides (or silicon wires) allow very small bend radii to be used resulting in a compact \nfootprint, but they suffer from increased loss and significant polarisation issues. Lack of a platform and \ndesign which would guarantee both desirable modal and polarisation properties has resulted in research \nin the area of optical filters evolving in two directions \u2013 small strip waveguide based filters and \nrelatively large rib waveguide based filters.  \n \n We have previously employed multi-stage ring configurations based upon rib waveguides to \nincrease FSR, FWHM and finesse of the resonator. By using Vernier configurations it is possible to \nachieve FSR of ~ 12 nm [8]. On the other hand, small strip waveguides allow bend radii of 1-3 \u00b5m, and \nfor a single resonator we have measured an FSR of 47 nm [9]. A Vernier device based on silicon wires \ncan achieve significantly larger FSR. \n \n \nReferences \n                                                 \n[1] L. Liao, D. Samara-Rubio, M. Morse, A.
