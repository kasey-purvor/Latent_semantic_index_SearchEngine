INTRODUCTION\nCoupled oscillatory systems are found in a diversity of\ndifferent contexts in science and technology, including, e.g.,\nengineering structures such as bridges \u00031,2\u0004, the flashing of\nmale fireflies \u00033\u0004, the mammalian cardiorespiratory system\n\u00034,5\u0004, the physics of plasmas \u00036\u0004, laser arrays \u00037\u0004, and chaos\n\u00038\u0004. Their understanding requires a knowledge of the int-\neroscillator interactions, and a common problem lies in ex-\ntracting this information from measurements of oscillator co-\nordinates, usually recorded in the form of time series. Where\nbivariate data are available for a pair of interacting oscilla-\ntors \u0001i.e., where the coordinate of each of them can be mea-\nsured separately\u0002, phase relationships can be obtained by use\nof the methods recently developed for analysis of synchroni-\nzation, or generalized synchronization, between chaotic\nand\/or noisy systems. Not only can the interactions be de-\ntected \u00039\u0004, but their strength and direction can also be deter-\nmined \u000310\u0004. The next logical step in studying the interoscil-\nlator interactions from measured data was to determine the\ntype of the couplings \u000311\u0004, as the methods developed for\nsynchronization analysis are not capable of answering this\nquestion.\nSystems are usually taken to be stationary. In reality, how-\never, mutual interactions among their subsystems often result\nin time variability of the characteristic frequencies. Fre-\nquency and phase couplings sometimes occur only tran-\nsiently, and the strength of coupling between pairs of indi-\nvidual oscillators may change with time. Under these\ncircumstances, conventional bispectral analysis for stationary\nsignals, based on time averages, is no longer sufficient.\nRather, the time evolution of the bispectral estimates is\nneeded. Priestley and Gabr \u000312\u0004 were probably the first to\nintroduce the time-dependent bispectrum for harmonic oscil-\nlators. Most subsequent work has been related to the time-\nfrequency representation and is based on high-order cumu-\nlants \u000313\u0004. An extensive overview can be found in \u000314\u0004.\nSchack et al. \u000315\u0004 have recently introduced a time-varying\nspectral method for estimating the bispectrum and bicoher-\nence: they obtain estimates by filtering in the frequency do-\nmain and then obtaining a complex time-frequency signal by\ninverse Fourier transform. They assume, however, that the\ninteracting oscillators are harmonic. Millingen et al. \u000316\u0004 in-\ntroduced the wavelet bicoherence and were the first to dem-\nonstrate the use of bispectra for studying interactions among\nnonlinear oscillators. They used the method to detect peri-\nodic and chaotic interactions between two coupled van der\nPol oscillators, but without concentrating on time-phase re-\nlationships in particular.\nIn an earlier paper \u000311\u0004, we extended bispectral analysis to\nencompass time dependence, and demonstrated the potential\nof the enhanced technique to determine the types of coupling\namong interacting nonlinear oscillators. Time-phase cou-\nplings can be observed by calculating the bispectrum and\nadapted bispectrum, thereby obtaining the time-dependent\nbiphase and biamplitude. This method has the advantage that\nit allows an arbitrary number of interacting oscillatory pro-\ncesses to be studied. It is applicable both to univariate \u0001a\nsingle signal from the coupled system\u0002, and to multivariate\ndata \u0001a separate signal from each oscillator\u0002. It yields results\nthat are applicable quite generally to any system of coupled\nnonlinear oscillators.\nIn the present paper, we introduce a new technique likely\nto be useful for studying complex oscillatory systems whose\ncharacteristic frequencies vary in time, e.g., the human car-\ndiovascular system \u00035\u0004. It is able to reveal both the existence\nof interactions among the subsystems, and also the nature of\nthe interactions. Cardiovascular signals are highly complex\nfrom the nonlinear dynamics point of view. Their frequencies\nand amplitudes, and the couplings among the subsystems,\nare all time variable. To be able to cope with this type of\nsignal we have incorporated wavelets into the technique and\nfurther extended it for studying the instantaneous phase cou-\nplings.\nIn what follows, however, we are mainly concerned with\nbasic principles, and in demonstrating and testing the tech-\nnique on a well-characterized simple model.

II we introduce the technique and in Sec. III we\ndescribe how it has been tested on a model coupled-oscillator\nsystem. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the\nFourier and wavelet bispectral methods are discussed in Sec.\nIV. Finally, in Sec. V we summarize the results obtained and\ndraw conclusions.\nII. METHOD\nA. Time-phase bispectral analysis\nWe start by summarizing briefly the salient features of\ntime-phase bispectral analysis as based on the Fourier trans-\nform. For a detailed discussion, see \u000311\u0004.\nThe classical bispectrum estimate is obtained as an aver-\nage of estimated third-order moments \u0001cumulants\u0002 M\u02c6 3i \u0001k , l\u0002\n\u000317\u0004,\nB\u02c6 \u0001k,l\u0002 =\n1\nK\u0005i=1\nK\nM\u02c6 3\ni \u0001k,l\u0002 , \u00011\u0002\nwhere the third-order moment estimate M\u02c6 3i \u0001k , l\u0002 is performed\nby a triple product of discrete Fourier transforms \u0001DFTs\u0002 at\ndiscrete frequencies k, l, and k+ l,\nM\u02c6 3\ni \u0001k,l\u0002 = Xi\u0001k\u0002Xi\u0001l\u0002Xi\n\u0001\u0001k + l\u0002 . \u00012\u0002\nHere i=1, . . . ,K label the time segments into which the sig-\nnal has been divided. The bispectrum B\u0001k , l\u0002 is a complex\nquantity, defined by magnitude A and phase \u0001,\nB\u0001k,l\u0002 = \u0006B\u0001k,l\u0002\u0006ej\u0002B\u0001k,l\u0002 = Aej\u0001. \u00013\u0002\nFor each \u0001k , l\u0002, the value of B\u0001k , l\u0002 can be represented as a\npoint in the space, Re\u0003B\u0001k , l\u0002\u0004 versus Im\u0003B\u0001k , l\u0002\u0004, thus defin-\ning a vector whose magnitude \u0001length\u0002 is known as the bi-\namplitude. The phase is determined by the angle between\nthis vector and the positive real axis and for the bispectrum is\ncalled the biphase.\nTo encompass time dependence within bispectral analysis\nin analogy with the short-time Fourier transform, we can\nmove a time window w\u0001n\u0002 of length M across the signal x\u0001n\u0002\nand calculate the discrete Fourier transform at each window\nposition,\nX\u0001n,k\u0002 \u0007\n1\nM \u0005i=0\nM\u22121\nx\u0001i\u0002w\u0001i \u2212 n\u0002e\u2212j2\u0002ik\/M , \u00014\u0002\nwhere k is the discrete frequency and n the discrete time. The\ninstantaneous biphase calculated from Eqs. \u00011\u0002 and \u00013\u0002 is\nthen\n\u0001\u0001k,l,n\u0002 = \u0001k\u0001n\u0002 + \u0001l\u0001n\u0002 \u2212 \u0001k+l\u0001n\u0002 . \u00015\u0002\nSimultaneously, we observe the instantaneous biamplitude,\nfrom which it is possible to infer the relative strength of the\ninteraction. It is thus possible to detect and quantify the pres-\nence of coupling among the oscillators and to follow its per-\nsistence in time.\nB. Wavelet bispectrum\nThe Fourier transform is based on the presumptions of \u0001a\u0002\nperiodicity and \u0001b\u0002 infinite length of the signal series \u000318,19\u0004.\nBecause neither assumption can be strictly true for any mea-\nsured signal, the determination of separate frequencies in a\nsystem that possesses strong couplings is very demanding.\nThe difficulty is greater in the low-frequency range, which is\nof particular interest to us, because the characteristic fre-\nquencies are close to each other and are therefore even\nharder to separate. The uncertainty principle governing the\nFourier transform limits its ability to separate harmonic com-\nponents in the frequency domain of the bispectrum \u000320,21\u0004.\nThis might cause problems for detection of quadratic phase\ncouplings in the case of frequency pairs that are close to-\ngether. To ensure good resolution of low frequencies, we\nneed longer sections for calculation of the discrete Fourier\ntransform. This immediately decreases the number of sec-\ntions possible and weakens the bispectrum estimation. How-\never, we cannot use longer signals, because they lead to non-\nstationarity, and the variance consequently becomes even\nlarger \u000322\u0004. One way of accommodating these conflicting\ndemands is through the introduction of wavelet analysis.\nWavelet analysis can be seen as a generalization of Fou-\nrier analysis \u000321\u0004 by the addition of time resolution\u2014in a\nmore fundamental way than is permitted by the short-time\nFourier transform \u0001STFT\u0002 \u000323\u0004. Wavelet analysis has been\napplied with considerable success to cardiovascular data\n\u000324\u0004. A generalization of bispectral analysis, based on wave-\nlets, may be expected to be able to detect temporal variations\nin phase coupling, or short-lived couplings, and to cope with\nbroadened and coalescing peaks that cannot be resolved due\nto the time-frequency resolution restrictions that govern the\nSTFT-based bispectrum.\nWavelet analysis was first introduced by Morlet \u000325\u0004. It\nenables the window length to be adjusted to the frequency\ncurrently being analyzed. It is a scale-independent method. It\nuses a window function known as the mother wavelet, or\nbasic wavelet \u0003\u0001u\u0002, which can be any function that satisfies\nthe wavelet admissibility condition \u000321\u0004. This function intro-\nduces a scale s \u0001its width\u0002 into the analyses. Commitment to\nany particular scale is avoided by using all possible scalings\nof \u0003\u0001u\u0002. The mother wavelet is also translated along the sig-\nnal to achieve time localization. Thus, a family of generally\nnonorthogonal basis functions is obtained,\n\u0004\u0001s,t\u0002 = \u0006s\u0006\u2212p\u0003\bu \u2212 t\ns\n\t . \u00016\u0002\nThe parameter p is an arbitrary non-negative number, used\nfor normalization. Values of p of 0, 1\/2, and 1 are encoun-\ntered in the literature \u000326\u0004. The prevailing choice of p=1\/2\nyields a factor \u0006s\u0006\u22121\/2 and ensures energy conservation. In this\ncase, the L2 norm of the wavelet, and thus its energy, is\nunaffected by the scaling operator s. The continuous wavelet\ntransform Wg\u0001s , t\u0002 of a signal g\u0001t\u0002 is defined as:\nWg\u0001s,t\u0002 = \n\n\u2212\u0005\n\u0005\n\u0004\u0001\b \u0006 \u2212 t\ns\n\tg\u0001\u0006\u0002d\u0006 \u00017\u0002\nand is a mapping of the function g\u0001t\u0002 onto the time scale\nplane.\nJAM\u0160EK, STEFANOVSKA, AND MCCLINTOCK PHYSICAL REVIEW E 76, 046221 \u00012007\u0002\n046221-2\nIn numerical applications, the scale s and time t are re-\nstricted to take discrete values. A natural discretization of the\nscaling parameter is sm=\u0007m, where m\u0001Z, and the step is a\npositive number \u0007\u00010,1. Within the scale \u0007m, the signal is\nsampled only at times tn=n\u0007m, which means that the sam-\npling rate is automatically adjusted to the scale \u000321\u0004.\nFor different values of m and n, we obtain the discrete\nwavelet family\n\u0004m,n\u0001u\u0002 = \u0007\u2212m\/2\u0003\u0001\u0007\u2212mu \u2212 n\u0006\u0002 , \u00018\u0002\nwhere we have set p=1\/2. The discrete wavelet transform,\ndefined by this family, is simply a sampled version of\nWg\u0001s , t\u0002. By choosing \u0007 near 1, we can obtain a representa-\ntion close to the continuous transform.\n1. Direct relationship between the scale and the frequency using\nMorlet wavelets\nCoupling between wavelets makes sense when a fre-\nquency can be assigned to the wavelet. We restrict our atten-\ntion to wavelets whose Fourier transforms exhibit a single\ndominant peak, and we define the location of that peak as\nbeing the corresponding frequency. In the literature \u000321\u0004, sev-\neral suitable wavelets are mentioned. Following earlier en-\nergy density studies of measured cardiovascular signals, the\nMorlet mother wavelet was chosen \u000324\u0004.\nMorlet proposed the use of a Gaussian function modu-\nlated by a sine wave. Its Fourier transform is a shifted Gauss-\nian, adjusted slightly so that the admissibility condition\n\u0003\u02c6 \u00010\u0002=0 is satisfied:\n\u0003\u02c6 \u0001f\u0002 = \u000b2\u0002 1\u000b4\u0002 \u0001e\n\u22124\u00022\u0001f \u2212 f0\u00022\/2\n\u2212 e4\u0002\n2f2\/2\n\u2212 e4\u0002\n2f02\/2\u0002 . \u00019\u0002\nThe corresponding time domain expression is\n\u0003\u0001u\u0002 = \u0002\u22121\/4\u0001e\u2212j2\u0002f0u \u2212 e4\u0002\n2f02\/2\u0002e\u2212u\n2\/2\n. \u000110\u0002\nThe choice of f0 represents a compromise between localiza-\ntion in time and in frequency. For smaller f0, the shape of the\nwavelet favors localization of singular time events whereas,\nfor larger f0, more periods of the sine wave within the win-\ndow improve the frequency localization. For f0\b0.8, the\nvalue of the second term in \u000110\u0002 is so small that it can be\nignored in practice, and a simplified expression for the Mor-\nlet wavelet in the time domain is\n\u0003\u0001u\u0002 = \u0002\u22121\/4e\u2212j2\u0002f0ue\u2212u\n2\/2\n. \u000111\u0002\nThe corresponding wavelet family consists of Gaussians cen-\ntered on a time t and with standard deviation s. In the fre-\nquency domain, we have Gaussians with a central frequency\nf = f0 \/s and a standard deviation of 1 \/2\u000b2\u0002s. Thus, applica-\ntion of the wavelet transform at a given scale s can also be\ninterpreted as bandpass filtering, giving an estimation of the\ncontribution to the frequencies in this band. The relationship\nbetween the scale and the central frequency for the Morlet\nwavelet is then\nf = f0\ns\n. \u000112\u0002\nThe frequency resolution changes with frequency. At low\nfrequencies \u0001large scales\u0002, the resolution is better than at the\nhigh frequencies \u0001small scales\u0002. Accordingly, the time reso-\nlution is better for high-frequency than it is for low-\nfrequency components. In order for peaks to be detected at f1\nand f2 \u0001f1\b f2\u0002, they must be separated by at least one-half\nof the standard deviation of the peak at the higher frequency,\nthus requiring f1\u2212 f2\t f1 \/4\u0002f0. The choice of f0 determines\nthe current frequency resolution. By choosing f0=1, we ob-\ntain a simple relation between scale and frequency, f =1\/s.\nSlow events are examined with a long window, while a\nshorter window is used for faster events. The Morlet wavelet\nprovides optimal time-frequency localization within the lim-\nits imposed by the uncertainty principle.\n2. Definition of the wavelet bispectrum\nFor the case of the wavelet bispectrum, the definitions are\nanalogous to those used in Fourier-based bispectral analysis\n\u000316,17\u0004. The wavelet bispectrum \u0001WB\u0002 BW is given by\nBW\u0001s1,s2\u0002 = \n\nT\nWg\u0001s1,\u0006\u0002Wg\u0001s2,\u0006\u0002Wg\n\u0001\u0001s,\u0006\u0002d\u0006 , \u000113\u0002\nwhere\n1\ns1\n+\n1\ns2\n=\n1\ns\n. \u000114\u0002\nThe WB measures the amount of phase coupling in the in-\nterval T that occurs between wavelet components of scale\nlengths s1, s2, and s of a signal g\u0001t\u0002, in such a way that the\nfrequency sum rule \u000114\u0002 is satisfied.

The nonredundant region of the\nWB is called its principal domain. The principal domain can\nbe further divided into two triangular regions in which the\nWB has different properties \u000328\u0004: the inner triangle \u0001IT\u0002, and\nthe outer one. Our interest centers on the IT \u000322,29\u0004.\n3. Wavelet bispectrum adapted to real signals\nThe relationship between the frequency \u0001scale\u0002 and the\nwidth of the window used for calculation of the wavelet\ntransform is hyperbolic. A log-log scale is therefore a natural\nchoice for its presentation. However, to be able to comply\nwith the frequency \u0001scale\u0002 sum rule \u000114\u0002, we need to achieve\nbetter frequency \u0001scale\u0002 resolution for high frequencies \u0001low\nscales\u0002 as can be effected by use of the Morlet wavelet when\nf0 is chosen to be 1. Otherwise, nearby peaks at high fre-\nquencies cannot be resolved. For this purpose we introduce\nparameters d and am into the Morlet wavelet\n\u0003\u0001u\u0002 = amcne\u22122\u0002f0ue\n\u2212u2\/d\n, \u000119\u0002\nwhere the constant cn=3.9487\u0002\u22121\/4. The parameter d deter-\nmines the exponential decay of the Gaussian. This attenuates\nthe Morlet wavelet, and thus permits the choice of a suitable\ncombination of time and frequency \u0001scale\u0002 resolution. The\ntime resolution is \nt=sd, given by the decay of the exponen-\ntial part of the wavelet. As d increases \u0001d\b1\u0002, the frequency\n\u0001scale\u0002 resolution improves, whereas the time resolution de-\nteriorates; d is set such that the Gaussian function decays to\n0.001 for each scale. A high value of d would cause a non-\nzero value of the Morlet window at its edges, resulting in\nside lobes on the WB. If d were infinite, the Morlet window\nwould become a unit window, and the wavelet transform\nwould become the selective discrete Fourier transform\n\u0001SDFT\u0002 \u000331\u0004. We wish to choose the frequencies in the analy-\nsis procedure freely, i.e., not restricted to s\u0001 \f2n\r, which im-\nplies a certain redundancy in the wavelet transform coeffi-\ncients.\nThe frequency resolution at high frequencies is still insuf-\nficient: it is necessary to increase the length of the Morlet\nwavelet for high frequencies. This can be achieved in differ-\nent ways. Figure 1 shows the hyperbolic decay of the Morlet\nwavelet length with increasing frequency \u0001solid line\u0002. The\nwavelet length can be multiplied by a factor am, equal to that\nfor the lowest frequency of interest, and then increased with\nincreasing frequency,\nam = 21.8\u0001f\u2212fmin\u0002\/\u0001fmax\u2212fmin\u0002, \u000120\u0002\nwhere f =1\/s is the frequency of observation, and fmin and\nfmax define the frequency range of interest. The constant, 1.8,\nis set experimentally. In this way, we obtain the dotted line in\nFig. 1. As the wavelet length is prolonged for high frequen-\ncies, the frequency resolution increases, whereas the time\nresolution deteriorates. Another way to obtain the necessary\nfrequency resolution is to use a fixed wavelet length for all\nhigh frequencies, as shown by the dash-dotted line in Fig. 1.\nWB estimation using the Morlet mother wavelet encoun-\nters a normalization problem. For each scale, a window of\ndifferent length is used. In the case of a signal composed of\ndifferent frequency components, but equal Fourier powers,\nthis would result in different wavelet spectral energies for\ndifferent frequencies. Two couplings among different fre-\nquencies with the same Fourier powers and the same nature\nof coupling, would result in different coupling strengths in\nthe wavelet bispectrum. In \u00016\u0002, a factor \u0006s\u0006\u22121\/2 is used to en-\nsure energy preservation. We choose to use a factor 1 \/NW\ninstead, where NW is the Morlet window length. In this way,\nwe can compare results obtained using FB and WB, since\nboth preserve energy.\nNormalization of the WB is achieved in the same way as\nfor the FB \u000311\u0004. The normalized WB indicates the average\nlevel of quadratic nonlinear phase coupling and, in a way,\nserves as an indicator of how non-Gaussian the signal is \u000332\u0004.\nThe critical values for the WB and biamplitude estimates\nwere normalized to 1. If the estimated value is higher than\nthe average value of WB in the IT, then it is taken as valid.\nBy critical value, we mean that a value exceeds the noisy\nbackground \u0001other than Gaussian\u0002, rounding, and estimation\nerrors.\n4. Instantaneous frequency\nThe bispectrum is sensitive to time variations of the fre-\nquency components, and it acquires a characteristic diagonal\nelongation of peaks. Bifrequencies where peaks in the\nbispectrum \u0001wavelet\u0002 provide evidence of possible phase\nand\/or frequency interactions are further studied by calcula-\ntion of the biphase and biamplitude as functions of time. In\ndoing so we do not follow time variations of the frequencies\nin the bifrequency pair when estimating time-biphase or\n-biamplitude dependence. They are estimated only for the\npeak bifrequency, i.e., where the average amplitude in the\nbispectrum takes its highest value. If the bifrequencies\nchange considerably during the time of observation, such an\napproach can yield misleading results. It is of course possible\nto calculate the biphase and biamplitude for all the bifre-\nquencies near the peak bifrequency and to plot them simul-\ntaneously in a graph, thus obtaining the time variations of the\ncoupled frequency components and the evolution of the bi-\nphase and biamplitude. The interpretation, however, is rather\ndifficult.\nTo be able to trace changes in the bifrequency \u0001f1 , f2\u0002\nunder study, we need to incorporate the instantaneous fre-\nquencies \u000333\u0004 f1\u0001t\u0002 and f2\u0001t\u0002 into the bispectral analysis. In\nthis way we can calculate the instantaneous biphase and in-\nstantaneous biamplitude for the instantaneous bifrequency\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 2\n0\n20\n120\nf (Hz)\nN\nW\n(s\n)\nFIG. 1.

Such an approach should lead to better results\nfor the time dependence of the biphase and biamplitude.\nThere are two main methods to determine the instantaneous\nfrequency of an oscillatory process, based on \u0001i\u0002 marked\nevents, and \u0001ii\u0002 an analytic signal.\nThe marked events method involves marking events that\nindicate completion of one cycle of oscillation. The frequen-\ncies determined from sequential pairs of marked events are\nthen linearly interpolated to obtain instantaneous values.\nMinimal or maximal values of the signal are usually taken as\nmarked events. For instance, the R peak is strongly pro-\nnounced in an electroencephalogram \u0001ECG\u0002 signal. It is eas-\nily distinguishable and can be automatically detected. The\nmarked events approach can be applied easily in the case of\nsignals where one oscillatory component dominates. How-\never, not all processes in the blood distribution system can be\nmeasured selectively. Most of the quantities that can be mea-\nsured, such as cardiovascular signals \u000324\u0004, contain multiple\noscillatory processes and maxima and minima are no longer\nuniquely determined.\nThe second approach is based on the Hilbert transform\n\u000334\u0004. From the signal under observation, x\u0001t\u0002, we construct\nan analytic signal\n\u000b\u0001t\u0002 = x\u0001t\u0002 + ixH\u0001t\u0002 = A\u0001t\u0002ej\u0001\u0001t\u0002, \u000121\u0002\nwhich is a complex function of time. The function xH\u0001t\u0002 is\nthe Hilbert transform of x\u0001t\u0002: A\u0001t\u0002 and \u0001\u0001t\u0002 are, respectively,\nthe instantaneous amplitude and phase. The instantaneous\nfrequency f\u0001t\u0002 can be obtained by numerical differentiation\nof \u0001\u0001t\u0002. In general, this may result in very large fluctuations\nin the estimate of f\u0001t\u0002 due to the influence of noise and\/or the\ncomplicated form of the signal. Although \u0001\u0001t\u0002 can be calcu-\nlated formally for arbitrary x\u0001t\u0002, it has a clear physical mean-\ning if x\u0001t\u0002 is a narrowband signal, in which case the instan-\ntaneous frequency corresponds to that of the maximum in the\ninstantaneous spectrum. Several methods are available for\nestimation of f\u0001t\u0002 in the \u0001usual\u0002 case where we are not inter-\nested in the behavior of a frequency on time scales smaller\nthan its characteristic oscillation period \u000335\u0004.\nWe suggest a combination of both methods to obtain the\ninstantaneous frequencies of oscillatory processes in the car-\ndiovascular system, depending on the shape of the signal\nunder scrutiny. The instantaneous frequency of cardiac oscil-\nlations is best calculated from ECG and blood pressure sig-\nnals using the marked events method. Marked events can\nalso be used to obtain the instantaneous frequency of the\nrespiratory oscillations directly from the respiration signal,\nwhereas the analytic signal procedure is best applied to cal-\nculate the instantaneous respiratory frequency from blood\nflow signals. In the latter case the signal must first be band-\npass filtered in the frequency domain, by assigning zero val-\nues to all amplitudes outside the respiratory frequency range\n\u000330\u0004.\nNote that the phase can also be obtained by direct use of\nthe coefficients of the complex continuous wavelet transform\n\u000336\u0004, a method that has been shown to yield a precision com-\nparable to that obtained by the marked events method and\nthe Hilbert transform. The combination of the wavelet trans-\nform and the bispectral analysis may further improve the\nprecision of phase detection, as the phases obtained are con-\ntinuous and the trade-off between frequency and time local-\nization may further be optimized by taking account of the\nsecond-order statistics of the bispectra. However, this is a\nmatter that needs additional investigation and will be re-\nported elsewhere in due course.\nIII. ANALYSIS\nA. Test signal\nTo illustrate the essence of the method, and to test it, we\nuse a generic model of two interacting systems whose basic\nunit is the Poincar\u00e9 oscillator\nx\u02d91 = \u2212 x1q1 \u2212 \f1y1 + \r2\u0001x1 \u2212 x2\u00022 + \u000e\u0001t\u0002 ,\ny\u02d91 = \u2212 y1q1 + \f1x1 + \r2\u0001y1 \u2212 y2\u00022,\nx\u02d92 = \u2212 x2q2 \u2212 \f2y2,\ny\u02d92 = \u2212 y2q2 + \f2x2,\nqi = \u000fi\u0001\u000bxi2 + yi2 \u2212 ai\u0002 . \u000122\u0002\nThe activity of each subsystem is described by the two state\nvariables xi and yi, where i=1,2 denotes the subsystem, \u000fi,\nai and \fi are constants, and \r2 is the coupling amplitude.\nThe parameters of the model are set to \u000f1=1, a1=0.5, and\n\u000f2 ,a2=1. Here \u000e\u0001t\u0002 is zero-mean white Gaussian noise\n\u000e\u000e\u0001t\u0002\u000f=0, \u000e\u000e\u0001t\u0002 ,\u000e\u00010\u0002\u000f=D\u0010\u0001t\u0002, and D=0.08 is the noise inten-\nsity.\nThe test signal is the variable x1A\u0001t\u0002 of the first oscillator,\nrecorded as a continuous time series as shown in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002.\nPrior to analysis, the signal was first normalized between 0\nand 1 and its mean value was subtracted. For the first 400 s,\nthere was quadratic coupling with \r2=0.2. After a further\n400 s, the forcing was removed by setting \r2=0. During the\nlast 400 s, the coupling was increased again to \r2=0.2. In the\nlatter case the characteristic frequency of the second oscilla-\ntor was both modulated and linearly increased from f2\n=0.25 to 0.35 Hz, as shown in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002. The first 15 s of\neach of the three coupling modes are shown in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002, with\nthe corresponding power spectra in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002.\nA standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta method \u0001RK4\u0002 was\nused for the numerical integration. The initial values and step\nsize were set to x1=\u22120.1, y1=1.0, x2=\u22120.1, y2=1.0, h\n=0.01. The signal x1 was than resampled to 10 Hz.\nB. Wavelet bispectrum\nA quadratic nonlinear interaction between linear or\nweakly nonlinear oscillatory systems generates higher-\nharmonic components in addition to the characteristic fre-\nquencies \u000322,37\u0004. Figure 2\u0001b\u0002 illustrates the changes in the\npower spectra caused by the coupling. The peaks at f1\n=1.1 Hz and f2=0.25 Hz refer to the first and second oscil-\nlators, respectively. These frequencies are deliberately cho-\nsen to approximate an integer ratio 1:4 to ensure frequency\nWAVELET BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS FOR THE STUDY OF\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 76, 046221 \u00012007\u0002\n046221-5\ncoupling. The test signal x1A clearly has richer harmonic\nstructure in the presence of nonlinear coupling. In addition to\nthe characteristic frequency of the first oscillator, it contains\ncomponents with frequencies 2f1, 2f2, f1+ f2, and f1\u2212 f2. As\nwell as having a particular harmonic structure, the compo-\nnents of the signal x1A also have related phases 2\u00011, 2\u00012,\n\u00011+\u00012, and \u00011\u2212\u00012.\nFor bispectral analysis the whole signal is analyzed as a\nsingle entity, after the transients caused by the changes in\ncoupling strength have been removed. First the WB is esti-\nmated, as shown in Figs. 4\u0001a\u0002 and 4\u0001b\u0002. Close inspection\nshows that all the peaks expected to arise from bispectral\nanalysis of the nonlinear interaction between the two oscil-\nlators f1 and f2 are indeed present. Quadratic coupling has\nalready been discussed in detail in \u000311\u0004 and is not a subject of\nthis paper.\nBifrequencies where peaks provide evidence of possible\nfrequency interactions are then further studied by calculation\nof the biphase and biamplitude as functions of time. Diago-\nnal elongation of peaks in the bispectrum demonstrates time\nvariation of the corresponding frequency components. The\ncharacteristic frequency of the second oscillator f2 varies\nwithin 0.25\u20130.35 Hz. Our primary interest lies in the bifre-\nquency \u0001f1 , f2\u0002. The time evolution of its biphase and biam-\nplitude are shown in Figs. 4\u0001c\u0002 and 4\u0001d\u0002. The results for\nnonzero coupling are quite different from those where cou-\npling is absent \u0001the second 400 s\u0002. The biphase is constant in\nthe presence of quadratic coupling \u0001first 400 s\u0002 and the bi-\namplitude is above zero. Let us concentrate on the third 400\ns, where one of the bifrequency components is varying. In\nthe bispectrum we concentrate on the peaks where possible\nphase and\/or frequency couplings are occurring. Here, we\nestimate the time evolution of the biphase for the peak bifre-\nquency, i.e., where the average biamplitude takes its highest\nvalue. This is why, near 800 s where the characteristic fre-\nquency of the second oscillator f2 has not risen much above\n0.25 Hz, we obtain constant biphase and high biamplitude as\nshown in Figs. 4\u0001c\u0002 and 4\u0001d\u0002. As f2 continues to grow lin-\nearly \u0001but with modulation\u0002 to 0.35 Hz, the biamplitude\ndrops toward zero and the biphase exhibits phase slips,\nfalsely suggesting that there is no coupling.\nC.

It can lead to misleading interpre-\ntation of the bispectral estimates, either of no coupling in the\nfirst case or of quadratic coupling in the second case.\nFigures 8\u0001a\u0002 and 8\u0001b\u0002 show the WB in perspective and\ncontour views, respectively, for the same signal x1B. The\nwavelet-based method clearly gives the same information\nabout the peak\u2019s relative amplitude and bifrequency as the\nFourier-based method, but the frequency resolution is evi-\ndently lower than in the latter case. The calculated instanta-\nneous biamplitude and biphase are presented in Figs. 8\u0001c\u0002\nand 8\u0001d\u0002 respectively.

The scope for\nchoice of window length is limited by the uncertainty prin-\nciple \u000321\u0004, and compromise is inevitably needed between\ntime and frequency resolution.\nIn contrast to the FB, the WB based on Morlet\u2019s mother\nwavelet enables us to enjoy optimal time and frequency reso-\nlution at the same time, which is an obvious advantage com-\npared to the FB.\nSince the time resolution of the WB is higher at high\nfrequencies compared to the FB, and the frequency resolu-\ntion poorer, it is necessary to ensure that there is sufficient\nfrequency resolution before attempting to interpret the results\nobtained. Poor frequency resolution would obviously result\nin poor or incorrect localization of the characteristic frequen-\ncies. Excessively high time resolution could result in a too-\nhigh sensitivity to noise and statistical error, in turn resulting\nin phase slips and incorrect detection of the onset and dura-\ntion of the interoscillator coupling. For our purposes, the\ntime and frequency resolution was set in such a manner that\ncoupling episodes of approximately ten periods of the lower\nfrequency are detectable \u0001to overcome coincidence cou-\nplings\u0002, and the characteristic frequencies can still be esti-\nmated to better than 10% \u000337\u0004.\n\u00012\u0002 Frequency step. Once the window length is chosen,\nthe frequency resolution is set and fixed for the FB. This is\nnot the case when using the wavelet transform. Since the\nwavelet transform is continuous, the frequency step can be\narbitrarily chosen. In this way, the transform can be over-\nsampled in time for large scales, and we are not concerned\nabout the inverse transform.\n\u00013\u0002 Energy preservation. Cardiovascular signals, which\nprovided the main motivation for this study, are signals\nwhose power is of interest \u000323\u0004. The FB is based on the DFT,\nwhich gives the signal\u2019s energy \u0001power\u0002 directly. In the case\nof the WB, normalization is necessary to obtain the signal\u2019s\nenergy \u0001power\u0002.\n\u00014\u0002 Statistical error. Integration over finite time series in\norder to calculate the WB results in an additional noise con-\ntribution. It is called the statistical noise level since it is the\nvalue of WB that would be computed for a white noise input\nsignal, and is caused by the finite statistics \u0001i.e., use of a\nlimited number of values in the integrating or averaging pro-\ncess\u0002. In addition, there is also an error equal to the product\nof uncertainties in the determination of the individual wave-\nlet bispectrum coefficients \u000316,21,22\u0004.\nTo calculate the WB, Eq. \u000113\u0002, the wavelet coefficients are\ndetermined for each of the NW=Tfs samples in the interval\nT : \fT0\u2212T \/2\u0012\u0006\u0012T0+T \/2\r, and averaged, Eq. \u00017\u0002. If we as-\nsume that all the estimates of the WB are independent, the\naveraged WB will suffer a statistical error of 1 \/\u000bNW due to\nsummation over NW values. Similarly, in the FB case the\nsummation is carried out over N \/M ensembles, where M is\nthe number of points in each statistically independent en-\nsemble for which an M-point DFT is calculated. The statis-\ntical error in the FB decays as \u000bM \/N, and a factor of M more\npoints is needed to obtain the same statistical error as with\nthe WB. From this point of view, the WB represents a sig-\nnificant improvement in the time resolution of the bispec-\ntrum. Although the wavelet coefficients are not all statisti-\ncally independent, because the chosen wavelet family is not\northogonal, the statistical error is not twice as large \u000316\u0004.\nThis implies that WB analysis is able to detect coherent sig-\nnals in extremely noisy data, provided that the coherence\nremains constant over sufficiently long intervals, because the\nnoise contribution falls off rapidly with increasing N.\n\u00015\u0002 Bispectrum interpretation. By choosing f0=1 in Eq.\n\u00019\u0002 a simple relation between scale and frequency can be\nobtained, f =1\/s. In this case the interpretation of the WB is\nthe same as for the FB; otherwise it is not straightforward.\n\u00016\u0002 Computation. The default WB window length de-\ncreases hyperbolically with increased frequency, whereas the\nFB uses a fixed window length. The WB is therefore com-\nputationally less demanding and much faster \u0001and the same\nargument applies for the fast Fourier transform as compared\nto the fast wavelet transform\u0002. Moreover, relatively short\ndata sequences are sufficient to perform a WB analysis, in\ncontrast to the FB, which needs long time series to obtain\nboth sufficient frequency resolution and adequate statistics.\nB. Other possible methods for bispectrum estimation\nThe selective discrete Fourier transform \u0001SDFT\u0002, a hybrid\nof the Fourier and wavelet transforms, can also be used for\ncalculation of the bispectrum. The modified STFT was first\nintroduced by Keselbrener and Akselrod \u000331\u0004. Like the STFT\nit is a time-dependent Fourier transform. The required time-\nfrequency sensitivity is obtained by applying a different win-\ndow of appropriate length for estimation of each spectral\ncomponent. Low frequencies are expected to vary slowly,\nwhereas high frequencies are expected to vary rapidly, i.e.,\nundergo sudden changes. For each frequency of interest, a\nDFT calculation is performed, while the time window around\nthe considered data point is made of length inversely propor-\ntional to the frequency of interest. This is actually similar to\nthe wavelet transform\u2019s stretching and compressing of the\nmother wavelet. Therefore narrow windows are used for es-\ntimating high frequencies and wide ones for low frequencies,\nimplying that low frequencies are estimated with good fre-\nquency resolution and high frequencies with good time reso-\nlution.\nFor each time scale of interest, spectral components are\ncalculated using different lengths of window, T=Np \/ f . The\nparameter Np, Np\u0001Z, is the number of entire periods within\nthe window. A high value of Np will lead to poor time reso-\nlution \u0001wide window\u0002, whereas a small value will lead to a\nless reliable estimate of the spectral components in the case\nof noisy signals. The value needed to produce optimal results\nWAVELET BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS FOR THE STUDY OF\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 76, 046221 \u00012007\u0002\n046221-9\nis determined experimentally and usually lies in the range\n4\u20138.\nLeakage may appear in the spectrum if the signal entering\nthe rectangular window is not periodic or, at least, if the\namplitudes of the end points are unequal. In order to remove\nsuch leakage, the data are usually convolved with some kind\nof smoothing window, such as a Hamming, Hanning, or\nBlackman window. Their role is to taper the windowed data\nin order to make the two end point amplitudes smoothly\nequal. Besides the leakage removal, these tapering windows\nalso improve the time resolution of the time-dependent spec-\ntral analysis.\nThe SDFT and WT provide similar results. Both trans-\nforms use a specific window length to estimate each spectral\ncomponent. The SDFT uses convolution with a Blackman,\nHanning, Hamming, or other taper window whereas the WT\nuses different mother wavelets such as the Morlet. Both\nmethods allow choice between good time or good frequency\nresolution. We can change frequency and time resolution by\nchanging parameters, but we cannot increase them both si-\nmultaneously because of the uncertainty principle. The WT\nobtained with the Morlet wavelet provides optimal time-\nfrequency resolution; while when using the SDFT this opti-\nmum can also be approached by an appropriate choice of\nparameters. They can both be normalized to energy. The\nmain difference between the transforms is that the WT is\ncontinuous whereas the SDFT is not. Note that the frequency\n\u0001scale\u0002 sum rule \u000114\u0002 is much easier to comply with if a\ncontinuous transform is used.\nV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe have introduced wavelet-based bispectral analysis us-\ning the Morlet mother wavelet, allowing for a clear scale-to-\nfrequency relationship. Since the time resolution of the\nwavelet bispectrum is higher and the frequency resolution\npoorer at high frequencies compared to the Fourier-based\nbispectrum, it is necessary to ensure sufficient frequency\nresolution to preserve the scale \u0001frequency\u0002 sum condition by\nincreasing the length of the Morlet wavelet for high frequen-\ncies. When the characteristic frequencies vary in time over a\nsignificant frequency interval the bifrequency \u0001f1 , f2\u0002 also\nhas to be time sensitive, and we therefore introduced the\ninstantaneous bifrequency (f1\u0001t\u0002 , f2\u0001t\u0002) into the wavelet\nbispectral analysis.\nThe advantages of wavelet- over Fourier-based bispectral\nanalysis are significant. Using the wavelet bispectrum, inter-\nmittent phase couplings can be detected, whereas the Fourier\nbispectrum averages out most of the time-relevant informa-\ntion. The WB allows an arbitrary frequency step to be cho-\nsen, thus ensuring optimal time and frequency resolution.\nThere is a simple relationship between scale and frequency;\nit has a smaller statistical error and is computationally less\ndemanding than for the FB. The only drawbacks are that it\nhas to be normalized to obtain signal energy and is nonor-\nthogonal. However normalization can be performed since we\nare not concerned with the inverse wavelet transform.\nIn general, the proposed wavelet bispectral analysis pro-\nvides a promising tool for studying the type of coupling be-\ntween two or more nonlinear oscillators whose basic fre-\nquencies change considerably in time. We conclude that\nwavelet-based bispectral analysis has potential for useful ap-\nplication to complex interacting systems that yield multivari-\nate time series. The method enables several aspects of the\ninteraction to be characterized simultaneously.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe study was supported by the Royal Society, Slovenian\nResearch Agency, Wellcome Trust \u0001U.K.\u0002, and the EU NEST\nPath-finder Tackling Complexity in Science project\nBRACCIA.\n\u00031\u0004 S.
