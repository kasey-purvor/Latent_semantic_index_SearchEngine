Turkey: a coupled limnological-\npalaeolimnological approach \n \nAbstract \n \nThe Ramsar site of Lake Uluabat, western Turkey, is suffering from eutrophication, \nindustrial pollution and water abstraction, and its naturally-fluctuating water levels are now \nmanaged artificially. Here we combine monitoring and palaeolimnological techniques to \ninvestigate spatial and temporal limnological variability and ecosystem impact, using an \nostracod and mollusc survey to strengthen interpretation of the fossil record. A \ncombination of low invertebrate Biological Monitoring Working Party scores (<10), low \nostracod and mollusc diversity across the lake basin, and the dominance of eutrophic \ndiatoms confirms the lake\u2019s poor ecological status. Analysis of organic and carbonate \ncontent, diatoms, stable isotopes, ostracods and molluscs in a radiometrically-dated \nsediment core (ULU20A) indicates a 20th century trend towards increased sediment \naccumulation rates and eutrophication which was probably initiated by deforestation and \nagriculture. The most marked ecological shift occurs in ca. 1962, however. A subtle rise in \ndiatom-inferred total phosphorus, coupled with an inferred reduction in submerged aquatic \nmacrophyte cover, accompanies a major increase in sediment accumulation rate; an \nassociated marked shift in ostracod stable isotope data indicative of reduced seasonality \nand a change in hydrological input indicates impact from artificial water management \npractises, all of which appears to have culminated in the sustained loss of submerged \nmacrophytes since 2000.  We discuss the implications for lake restoration in the context of \nthe EU Water Framework Directive. In a wider context, the results have important \nimplications for the conservation of shallow karstic lakes, the functioning of which is still \npoorly understood. \n \nKeywords \n \nKeywords: biomonitoring, palaeolimnology, diatoms, ostracods, isotopes, eutrophication \nMODERN AND PALAEOECOLOGY \n \n 3\n  \n \n"}
