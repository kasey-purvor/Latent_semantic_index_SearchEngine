This \nchoice of words meant, on the one hand, that it had not been in existence before (some of) the \ncrimes it was meant to try were being committed and, on the other hand, that it was not meant \nto be a permanent institution.  The idea behind it was also that it should try mainly the top-\nlevel perpetrators, the masterminds and political as well as military leaders of all sides to the \nconflict.  Due to the fact that in the beginning of its operation the war was still raging in \nBosnia, and that therefore it was difficult to secure the presence of such high-ranking leaders, \nit started its first case with a low-level accused, Dusko Tadic, whose moniker almost became \na household name, as the man who was the object of the first genuine international war \ncrimes trial after Nuremberg and Tokyo. \nThe people arrested and transferred to the ICTY in the course of the first few years \nwere mostly of the same category, including a few one might term \u201cmiddle-management\u201d, \nlike Blaskic, Kordic and Cerkez.  Apart from Slobodan Milosevic, who was unceremoniously \nhanded over to the ICTY by the former Serbian prime minister Zoran Djindjic in an act of \nGordian-knot-cutting, and the admittedly noble example of Biljana Plavsic\u2019s public remorse, \nnone of the former \u201cbig guns\u201d, heads of state like Franjo Tudjman and Alija Izetbegovic, or \nthe chief of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb Republic, Republika Srpska, Radovan \nKaradzic, and his executioner Ratko Mladic, have been arrested, let alone transferred to the \nHague.  Izetbegovic has, to public knowledge and maybe not surprisingly, not been indicted \nto-date, and Tudjman died before the ICTY Prosecutor could make up her mind about \nwhether or not to indict him. \nThe backlog of cases at the ICTY, as well as the length of time it takes to finish an \nindividual case, has spurred its judges to consider ways and means of finding an \u201cexit \nstrategy\u201d that would help the ICTY do justice to the second meaning of the words \u201cad hoc\u201d \ndescribed above, and to wind down its operation within a reasonable time-frame.  The budget \nfor the ICTY (and its sister tribunal for Rwanda, the International Criminal Tribunal for \nRwanda or ICTR) gobbles up a large slice of the United Nations financial pie, and other \npeace-keeping missions will clamour for their fair share of the same.  The ICTY was \ntherefore under pressure to keep control of this process and to contribute as much as possible \nto shaping the procedure of phasing its cases out.  One way to do this was to consider the \npossibility of returning cases to the national judicial systems of the former Yugoslavia, and \n                                                 \n*  Judge at the District Court for Southern Thuringia at Meiningen, Germany; Dr. iur.

The Rome Agreement of 18 February 1996, also called the \u201cRules \nof the Road, an agreement between Presidents Izetbegovic, Tudjman and Milosevic1 already \nprovided for a procedure of screening domestic investigations by the ICTY Prosecutor, \nwithout whose consent a local prosecution could not go forward.  But what was necessary \nnow was a procedure that also worked the other way.  \nThis article presents an overview over the development of the exit strategy, and breaks \nnew ground insofar as for the first time the Office of the High Representative\u2019s (OHR) \nConsultants\u2019 Report of 27 May 2002, which had been confidential and was kindly provided \nto me by the OHR, is described in detail.  The paper, on account of the myriad of legal issues \ninvolved, cannot be a critique of the legal background of the exit strategy, but merely gives \nan account of its factual development until April 2003. \n \nI. DEVELOPMENTS UNTIL MAY 2002 \n \nIn the year 2000, under the then presidency of Claude Jorda, now the French judge at \nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) and an especially energetic president of the ICTY as \nfar as the critique and improvement of its performance were concerned, the judges began \nthinking ahead towards formulating a completion or exit strategy, after getting a little nudge \nfrom the Expert Group which scrutinised the functioning of both the ICTY and ICTR in \n1999.2  Elected President of the ICTY on 16 November 1999, already on 27 January 2000 \nClaude Jorda made a first statement in which he promised to explore avenues of speeding up \nthe proceedings of the ICTY, explicitly referring to the  report of the Expert Group.3  This \nwas followed by an extraordinary plenary session on 18 April 2000, where the Prosecutor \ndescribed for the first time her completion strategy in concrete numbers, and stated that she \nwould finish thirty-six investigations, mainly related to Kosovo, by 2004.  The judges \nmandated the President to present a long-term judicial strategy for the tribunal.4  On 23 May \n2000, the President addressed the Plenary Meeting of the Peace Implementation Council, a \n \n1  Para. 5 of the Rome Agreement of 18 February 1996 provides:  \n5. Cooperation on War Crimes and Respect for Human Rights: \nAs part of their obligation to cooperate fully in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes and \nother violations of international humanitarian law, as provided in Article IX of the General Framework \nAgreement, the Parties will provide unrestricted access to places, including mass grave sites, relevant \nto such crimes and to persons with relevant information. IFOR will work to provide a secure \nenvironment for the completion of these tasks. \nPersons, other than those already indicted by the International Tribunal, may be arrested and detained \nfor serious violations of international humanitarian law only pursuant to a previously issued order, \nwarrant, or indictment that has been reviewed and deemed consistent with international legal standards \nby the International Tribunal. Procedures will be developed for expeditious decision by the Tribunal \nand will be effective immediately upon such action. \nSee the  OHR website at <http:\/\/www.ohr.int\/ohr-dept\/hr-rol\/thedept\/war-crime-\ntr\/default.asp?content_id=6093> (last accessed on 19 May 2003). \n2  See the recommendations in the \u201cReport of the Expert Group to Conduct a Review of the Effective \nOperation and Functioning of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda\u201d, 22 November 1999, UN Doc.

President Jorda did \nnot address at that time the ideas of referring cases back to domestic jurisdictions, maybe \nbecause it might have proved counter-productive with respect to the ad litem issue.6  In his \nReport on the Operation of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia of \nMay 2000,7 which formed the basis of his speech before the Security Council in June, the \nPresident acknowledged8 the need to provide the administration of the United Nations with \n\u201ca relatively exact idea of the length of the mandate\u201d9 of the ICTY\nA study by the Human Rights Centre and the International Human Rights Law Clinic \nof the University of California at Berkeley and the Centre for Human Rights of the University \nof Sarajevo10 of May 2000 had come to the conclusion that a larger involvement of the local \njustice systems in Bosnia was advisable, and that international lawyers often lacked the \nnecessary familiarity with the legal system of Bosnia. \nThe Prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, indicated as early as 6 October 2000 that she might \neven be willing to consider co-operating in the prosecution of lower-level war criminals, on \nthe occasion of a new initiative launched by the Republika Srspka to prosecute those involved \nin the Srebrenica massacre.11  In his speech before the United Nations General Assembly on \n20 November 2000, Claude Jorda again addressed the limited mandate and indicated that the \nICTY was contemplating the idea of trials held by national justice systems.12  In her speech \nto the Security Council on 21 November 2000, the Prosecutor did, however, indicated that \nshe not relish the intention expressed by Yugoslav President Kostunica of trying Slobodan \nMilosevic in Belgrade instead of transferring him to the ICTY.13  She repeated these \nsentiments in a press statement on 20 December 2000 in the Hague.14 \nA first case in which the Prosecutor did not seek a referral under Rule 9 of the ICTY \nRules of Procedure and Evidence, and openly applauded the activities of the domestic \njudiciary, was the Croatian investigation of former general Mirko Norac for his involvement \nin the so-called Gospic case and other war crimes.   Norac, who could be termed at least a \nmid-level offender,15 was sentenced to twelve years\u2019 imprisonment for war crimes by the \nRijeka County Court on 24 March 2003, a sentence commensurate with those handed down \nby the ICTY in similar cases.16 \n \n5  Press release of  24 May 2000, CC\/P.I.S.\/502-e. \n6  Press release of 20 June 2000, SB\/P.I.S.\/512-e, containing the full text of the speech. \n7  Available on the ICTY website as an appendix to the press release of 20 June 2000, SB\/P.I.S.\/512-e. \n8  At paras. 1 to 6 of the Report. \n9  Ibid., para. 3. \n10  \u201cJustice, Accountability and Social Reconstruction, An Interview Study of Bosnian Judges and \nProsecutors\u2019, May 2000, directed by Harvey Weinstein, Laurel Fletcher and Ermin Sarajlija. \n11  Press release of 6 October 2000, PR\/P.I.S.\/532-e. \n12  Press release of 20 November 2000, JD\/P.I.S.\/540-e, containing the full text of the speech. \n13  Press release of 24 November 2000, JL\/P.I.S.\/542-e, containing the full text of the speech. \n14  Press release of 20 December 2000, FH\/P.I.S.\/550-e. \n15  Press release of 21 February 2001, FH\/P.I.S.\/565-3. \n16  See \u201cNews in Brief\u201d on the website of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n(OSCE) Mission in Croatia <www.osce.org\/croatia> (last accessed on 3 April 2003). \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 4 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nOn 12 May 2001, Claude Jorda visited Sarajevo on the occasion of the debate about a \nTruth and Reconciliation Commission of Bosnia, and there he expressed doubts and \nreservations regarding the quasi-judicial powers of that commission with respect to the \nprimacy of the ICTY.  He said, inter alia, that the mandate of the truth and reconciliation \ncommission must not be similar to that of the International Tribunal.  He stressed that \nalthough he supported the initiative, he was also concerned that the most recent draft law \nseemed to grant to the commission functions and powers similar in many ways to those of the \nInternational Tribunal.  For this reason, he did not believe that the commission was merely a \ncomplementary organ.  The draft law also failed to define clearly the commission's \nobligations to the International Tribunal.  He pointed out that the language of the draft \nimplied that the truth and reconciliation commission will have judicial powers which belong \nexclusively to the International Tribunal, and that the commission appeared to be vested with \nreal investigative powers. While investigating did not fall within the exclusive domain of the \nProsecution, the Prosecutor nevertheless had primacy with respect to national jurisdiction in \nthis area. Even though the commission was not bound by this principle, the draft law would \nhave to take it in consideration. It also appeared to him that the Commission might have the \nauthority to demand that it be provided with all information it considered useful for its \nmission, which infringed on the activity of the Prosecutor.  All this confused the role of the \nproposed commission and could risk infringing upon the International Tribunal's \nindependence and prove extremely prejudicial to it in the long term.  To define the \nobligations of both the commission and the International Tribunal, he suggested that a \nprovision expressly state that the commission would not interfere in any way in the judicial \nactivity of the International Tribunal and that it would provide to the Tribunal all the public \nor confidential information and documents it required, maintain close contacts with its \ninvestigators and authorise a liaison officer from the International Tribunal to attend its \nhearings.  The ICTY\u2019s mission of reconciliation would be seriously compromised if the \nhighest political and military accused were not arrested and tried by the International \nTribunal before the completion of its work.  Therefore, it was imperative that the commission \nand the Tribunal accomplish their respective mission jointly, which rendered necessary the \nprompt arrest and transfer of all accused to the Tribunal.17 \nIn his next address to the Security Council on 27 November 2001, Claude Jorda \nfinally dealt with the idea of \u201crelocating\u201d, as he called it, cases to the states in the Balkans.  \nHe indicated that the judges of the two International Tribunals had met in September 2001 in \nDublin, together with Hans Correll, Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs, and had \nundertaken to reflect upon the ICTY\u2019s priorities for the years to come.  They discussed \nwhether the ICTY should not focus more on prosecuting the crimes committed by the high-\nranking military and political officials.  The cases of lesser importance for the Tribunal could, \nunder certain conditions, be \u201crelocated\u201d, that is, tried by the courts of the States created out of \nthe former Yugoslavia.  This solution would have the merit of considerably lightening the \nTribunal\u2019s workload, thereby allowing it to complete its mission at an even earlier juncture.  \nMoreover, it would make the trial of the cases referred to national courts more transparent to \nthe local population and so make a more effective contribution to reconciling the peoples of \nthe Balkans. \n \n17  Press release of 17 May 2001, JL\/P.I.S.\/591-e, containing the full text of the speech. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 5 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nFor it to be possible to \u201crelocate\u201d the cases of lesser importance for the Tribunal, the \njudicial systems of the States of the former Yugoslavia had to be reconstructed on democratic \nfoundations.  The national courts would have to be placed in a position to accomplish their \nwork with total independence and impartiality and with due regard for the principles \ngoverning international humanitarian law and the protection of human rights.  This would \nsuppose, among other things, that under the aegis of the representatives of the international \ncommunity in the Balkans, judges or international observers were sent to participate in or be \npresent at the trials of war criminals and that existing training programmes for local judges be \nexpanded.  President Jorda told the Security Council that he was aware that the process of \njudicial reconstruction was making good progress.  The International Tribunal was prepared \nto make its contribution and be willing to reflect on what amendments to the rules of \nprocedure and evidence would be implied by a redefinition of the relationship between the \nInternational Tribunal and national courts, or indeed any means in the processes of national \nreconciliation.18  He had already voiced these ideas before the General Assembly on 26 \nNovember 2001.19  The topic was also addressed by Carla del Ponte, the ICTY Prosecutor, in \nher speech to the Security Council on 27 November 2001.20 \nIn January 2002, the President, Prosecutor and Registrar created a working group \nwhose mission was to examine the problems which might arise through the implementation \nof the process of referring certain cases.  In February 2002, they addressed a joint letter to the \nUnited Nations Secretary-General  informing him of this initiative. \nOn 28 February 2002, Pierre-Richard Prosper, Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes \nIssues in the United States Department of State, and himself a former staff member of the \nOffice of the Prosecutor at the ICTR, had already upped the ante in  a speech before the \nCommittee on International Relations of the United States House of Representatives. He was \npushing the new Bush Administration\u2019s intention to wind down the two tribunals as quickly \nas possible, by saying, not always very diplomatically: \n \nThe United States remains proud of its leadership in \nsupporting the two ad hoc Tribunals and will continue to do \nso in the future.  Their work is important and has greatly \ncontributed to justice for the victims of war crimes and to \nending impunity for those who would orchestrate and \ncommit genocide. \u2026 These efforts show that the Tribunals \nare on the path to success.  However, despite these \nachievements, we recognize that there have been problems \nthat challenge the integrity of the process. In both \nTribunals, \u2026 the process, at times, has been costly, has \nlacked efficiency, has been too slow, and has been too \nremoved from the everyday experience of the people and \nthe victims. \u2026  [T]he goal of this Administration is to see \nthe Tribunals reach a successful conclusion.  That means \nthe Tribunals need to remain within the spirit of the \n \n18  Press release of 27 November 2001, JD\/P.I.S.\/641-e, containing the full text of the speech. \n19  Ibid. \n20  Ibid. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 6 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nfounding resolutions and pursue those who bear the greatest \nresponsibility. \u2026  [T]he Tribunals were not established to \njudge each and every violation of law that occurred during \nthe conflicts.  And they were not designed to completely \nusurp the authority and, more importantly, the \nresponsibility of sovereign states. In establishing these \norgans, the Security Council clearly envisioned the shared \nresponsibility of local governments to adjudicate some of \nthese serious violations. And it is this shared responsibility \nthat will lead us to the successful conclusion we seek.  As a \nresult, this Administration is \u2026 urging both Tribunals to \nbegin to aggressively focus on the end-game and conclude \ntheir work by 2007-2008, a timeframe that we have stressed \nand to which officials from both Tribunals have referred.  \nWe are calling on the regional states to do their part: to \ncooperate fully with the Tribunals' investigations and \nprosecutions.  We are aggressively engaging the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Croatia \nat the highest levels to remind them of their international \nobligation to transfer all at-large indictees to The Hague. \u2026  \nWe are also pressing the governments in the former \nYugoslavia to accept their responsibility, \u2026 to hold \naccountable the mid and lower level perpetrators.  The \nlower level perpetrators in both of these regions do not get \na free pass.  We do not want to see an abandonment of the \nstate responsibility and are encouraging appropriate \ndomestic judicial and administrative action. \u2026  For this \u2026 \ncause to be successful, \u2026 the international community, the \nTribunals, and the regional states must coordinate, accept \ntheir role and individual responsibility, and go down this \narduous road together. \u2026  In \u2026 creating an environment \nwhere there is not a dependency on international \nmechanisms we will bring justice to the victims and restore \nconfidence in domestic institutions in societies throughout \nthe world.21 \n \nPresident Jorda took this criticism in stride when Prosper and the U.S. Ambassadors in the \nHague, Belgrade, Zagreb and Sarajevo visited the ICTY on 6 March 2002, by expressing his \npleasure at the United States\u2019 support for the reforms undertaken by the ICTY.22 \nIn March and April 2002, the President, Prosecutor and Registrar met with the \nmembers of the OHR responsible for reforming the judicial system, and together they \nformulated a plan of action.

In keeping with the goal of focussing on the persons responsible for the \nmost serious violations of international humanitarian law, the report examined the possibility \nof referring cases involving intermediate-level alleged perpetrators to the domestic courts.  \nThe Tribunal intended to satisfy itself beforehand that the domestic courts were operating \nwith full respect for the principles of humanitarian law and the protection of human rights.  \nAmongst the solutions the report recommended were the establishment of a chamber at the \nenvisaged State Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina with specific jurisdiction to try war crimes \nsuspects.  Additionally, the report also proposed the appointment of international judges or \nobservers to the State Court, and provision of training in international humanitarian law to the \nlocal judiciary and court personnel.24 \n \nII. THE OHR REPORT OF MAY 2002 \n \nThe consultants, Peter Bach, Kjell Bj\u00f6rnberg, John Ralston and former ICTY judge \nAlmiro Rodrigues, had been retained in order to examine the issues and make \nrecommendations for future war crimes prosecutions to take place in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina.  The OHR provided the consultants with a large number of reports.25.  In \naddition, the consultants reviewed relevant existing legislation and draft legislation.26  They \nheld meetings with representatives of organisations, institutions or organs of government at \nthe State level, in the Federation, Republika Srpska and in the Brcko District.  Similarly they \nmet with representatives of various international organisations, including UNMIBH, involved \nin Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as with representatives of the ICTY. \nThe ICTY was seeking to identify a trustworthy domestic court that it is willing to \ntransfer cases to.  A figure of up to seventeen cases involving fifty accused had been \nmentioned in this context.  Under the Rules of the Road programme there were already \npotentially up to 300 cases which could be prosecuted locally.  The International Crisis \nGroup (ICG) identified an additional sixty-three alleged war criminals not indicted by the \nICTY nor necessarily mentioned in Rules of the Road files.  At least half did not even appear \nto be under investigation, and all enjoyed some degree of control in their home \nmunicipalities.  These cases were likely to be highly sensitive, and it was questionable \nwhether they could be conducted at the local level.  Local police investigations and \nprosecutions were criticised as ethnically biased, subject to improper influence by officials \nand criminals alike, and not professionally investigated, prosecuted or adjudicated. \nAs reported by the International Crisis Group, war crimes in one entity or canton were \nstill hailed as acts of heroism in another.  Further, it was stated that the ICTY\u2019s ability to try \n \n23  See para. 6 of the \u201cReport on the Judicial Status of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \nYugoslavia and the Prospects for Referring Certain Cases to National Courts, June 2002\u201d, available on \nthe ICTY website as an appendix to the press release of 20 June 2000, SB\/P.I.S.\/512-e. \n24  Press release of 24 April 2002, JdH\/P.I.S.\/671-3. \n25  \u201cConsultants\u2019 Report to the OHR, The Future of Domestic War Crimes Prosecutions in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina\u201d, May 2002, Annex 5.

Those courts must be \nmade fit to handle this delicate assignment.  The current practice of trying indicted war \ncriminals in cantonal or entity courts had proved inadequate.  Justice had neither been done \nnor been seen to be done.  Trials were regarded as occasions for dispensing \u201cethnic\u201d justice \nor exacting revenge.  Moreover, such trials were politically explosive, especially as various \npast and present national leaders were among those indicted or likely to be indicted.27 \nThe report recalled that the ICTY had developed a project proposal regarding the \nremission of some cases to a special court in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Before presentation of \nthe proposal to the United Nations Security Council on 26 November 2001, the ICTY \nProsecutor had presented it to the OHR, the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina (UNMIBH) and the Bosnia and Herzegovina Council of Ministers (COM).  The \nproposal was welcomed by the three bodies as an opportunity to expedite war crimes \nprosecutions, enhance the work of the ICTY and contribute to judicial reform in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina.  All three agencies had agreed that the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina \nappeared to be the most appropriate institution for the prosecution of war crimes cases.   \nThe consultants examined various models for the conduct of war crimes cases, \nincluding the Federation Cantonal Courts, District Courts in the Republika Srpska, the entity \nSupreme Courts and the Brcko District Court.  They also considered establishing a special \ncourt (\u201cmini-Hague\u201d), a special court in each entity or a special state level court.  As the draft \nlaw on the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina established a criminal division, the consultants \nalso examined whether the establishment of an international humanitarian law chamber or \ndivision in this Court would be the best option.  \nThe main issues were: \n \n\u2022 political and other influence of the proceedings; \n\u2022 serious concerns about the independence of the judiciary; \n\u2022 widespread concerns over impartiality and ethnic bias; \n\u2022 doubts that mono-ethnic courts can deliver impartial judgements; \n\u2022 objections to cantonal or district courts having a role as that would be open \nto influence at local level; \n\u2022 cases against some of the more notorious offenders would never happen if \nleft to local authorities;  \n\u2022 little confidence that investigations would be conducted efficiently, \neffectively or impartially;  \n\u2022 questions of competence and failure to meet international legal standards; \n\u2022 lack of suitable infrastructure and financial support to conduct trials of this \nnature;  \n\u2022 need for a mixed judiciary representing the three main ethnic groups in \nBosnia and Herzegovina; \n\u2022 protection of witnesses; \n\u2022 security of personnel, premises and information security;   \n\u2022 lack of inter-entity and intra-entity co-operation in war crimes cases;  \n \n27  Ibid., pp. 5-7. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 9 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \n\u2022 unlikelihood of arrests of persons accused of war crimes, especially when \nresiding in the other entity;  \n\u2022 verdicts from courts in one entity not likely to be recognised in the other \nentity, verdicts of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina not likely to be \nrecognised in either entity; \n\u2022 the need to harmonise local law and practice with ICTY rules and \njurisprudence, particularly with regard to command responsibility; and \n\u2022 securing adequate funding. \n \nThe majority of the persons interviewed from the Federation and the international \ncommunity observed that cases would not be conducted with sufficient quality without \ninternational participation, which was even accepted by some from the Republika Srpska.  \nMost agreed that it would be positive to have cases prosecuted in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  \nThis would raise confidence in local institutions and raise awareness of the overall issues \ninvolved.  In meetings with the representatives of the Federation, there was considerable \nsupport for a special court to deal with war crimes cases.  There was some digression as to \nwhether it should be at the state or entity level, but most favoured a state-level court and felt \nthat an international humanitarian law division within the Criminal Division of the Court of \nBosnia and Herzegovina would be a suitable solution.  In the Republika Srpska there was \nsupport for special courts to deal with cases at the entity level.  The representatives were \nagainst a state-level court and questioned whether a state court could have constitutional \ncompetence to prosecute war crimes cases.  There was also a strong desire for the venue of \ncases to be determined by the locality in which the crime took place, and not where the \nvictims resided.  Existing structures should be used, with monitors. A separate court beyond \nthe current system would mean loss of confidence in domestic courts.  The international \ncommunity clearly favoured a state-level solution28. \nThe consultants recommended the establishment of an international humanitarian law \n(IHL) division within the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  This division, composed of both \nan appeals chamber and one or more trial chamber was to bear overall responsibility for the \nconduct of cases involving serious violations of IHL in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  It would \nhave national and international judges. One of the international judges should be elected \npresident of the IHL division.29  The consultants proposed that the IHL division be \nfreestanding from the Criminal Division and any possible Special Organised Crime, \nEconomic Crime and Corruption Division, although administratively it would be a part of the \nCourt of Bosnia and Herzegovina and have the advantage of shared personnel, equipment, \netc.  They also said that an IHL state prosecutor\u2019s office should be established. \nReferring to the jurisprudence of the Bosnian Constitutional Court, the consultants \nwere of the opinion that the establishment of such a division was not in contravention with \nthe Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The legislation on the Court of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina would have to be amended and provisions for the proceedings in these cases \nincluded in the State Criminal Procedure Code.  The consultants said that the IHL division \nshould be entitled to establish its own Book of Rules. \n \n28  Ibid., pp. 8-10. \n29  Ibid., p. 12. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 10 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nGiven the potentially high number of war crimes cases, the IHL division would not be \nable to deal with all cases in Bosnia and Herzegovina, leaving a role for entity-level courts.  \nThe IHL division would need the ability to transfer cases to cantonal courts in the Federation, \ndistrict courts in the Republika Srpska and the Brcko District Court where appropriate.  The \ntrial chamber should be able to do this after the filing of the indictment; prior to that it would \nbe the responsibility of the IHL prosecutor.  The consultants said that IHL division should \nalso have a supervisory role with regard to such prosecutions within the entities, and that the \nIHL prosecutor should monitor trials conducted at the entity level.  On the motion of the \nProsecutor, a trial chamber should be empowered to recall a case from the entity court if the \ncase was not conducted in a manner consistent with international standards.30 \n \n2.1 The chambers \n \nThe sensitivity of cases, and concerns that they will be decided along ethnic lines, \ndictate a multi-ethnic composition of the court, the prosecutor\u2019s office and the investigation \nwing, to ensure impartiality.  International participation in all parts of the judicial procedure \nwas thought to be inevitable if an acceptable standard of the proceedings was to be reached.  \nA system consisting of a mixture of international and national personnel was preferred to one \nwith purely international personnel.  It was thought this would give the system higher public \ncredibility and recognition, and would also be an opening for the creation, in the long run, of \na purely national system of handling war crimes cases. \nThe consultants considered many different options in determining the composition of the \ntrial chamber panels.  Four main features were identified as necessary: \n \n\u2022 a multi-ethnic panel to minimise complaints of ethnic bias; \n\u2022 international representation to ensure impartiality and that trials are \nconducted according to international standards;  \n\u2022 an uneven number of judges to avoid deadlocked panels; and \n\u2022 an effective working composition of judges. \n \nThis led, in the final analysis, to two possible models: a trial panel composed of two \nnational judges from different ethnic groups and one international judge; or a trial panel \ncomposed of three national judges from different ethnic groups and two international judges.  \nThe first option was strongly supported, but considered problematic because one or more of \nthe constituent groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina would not be represented.  The second \noption was less than ideal because five judges are considered too many to hear a trial in first \ninstance.  The consultants, however, proposed nevertheless that a trial chamber within the \ndivision should consist of five judges, three of whom would be nationals, each from a \ndifferent ethnic group, with two international appointments, and that a panel should consist of \neither all judges in the chamber or three judges, including one international.  Initially it was \nrecommended that one trial chamber be established.  If the volume of work demanded and \nfunding was available, additional trial chambers could be created31. \n \n30  Ibid., pp. 10-12. \n31  Ibid., p. 12. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 11 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nThe IHL appeals chamber would ultimately hear appeals on decisions of the IHL trial \nchamber.  For an accused whose trial for war crimes took place in a Federation Cantonal \nCourt, a District Court in Republika Srpska or the Brcko District Court, the avenue of appeal \nwould be to the IHL trial chamber.  Appeals from either the IHL trial chamber to the IHL \nappeals chamber or from the entity level courts to the IHL trial chamber would be limited to \nmatters involving errors on a question of law invalidating the decision and errors of fact \noccasioning a miscarriage of justice. \nIt was not recommended that the appeals chamber hear appeals directly from the cantonal \nand district courts, as it was assumed that the number of appeals from the local courts could \nbe overwhelming.  The consultants also considered that the IHL trial chamber should be of a \nhigher rank within the judiciary in Bosnia and Herzegovina than the cantonal and district \ncourts.  However, it was deemed necessary to ensure consistency in the application of \ninternational humanitarian law throughout all courts, something that suggested a single \nappellate court in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  To secure this aim, a review mechanism, similar \nto that of extraordinary remedies, was proposed for appeals to the IHL appeals chamber.  A \nsingle judge of the appeals chamber would be entitled to grant leave to appeal a decision of \nthe trial chamber in relation to an appeal in a case tried in first instance by a local court, if the \ndecision was clearly inconsistent with international humanitarian law or clearly inconsistent \nwith the jurisprudence of the IHL appeals chamber. \nDecisions of the appeals chamber and refusal of leave to appeal by an appeals \nchamber judge would settle cases definitively.  Cases tried after an appeal would only be sent \nback to the lower instance court to be retried if grave errors of fact had occurred.  Where a \nnew fact had been discovered which was not known at the time of the proceedings and could \nhave been a decisive factor in reaching judgement, a submission for review of the judgement \ncould be submitted. \nThe IHL appeals chamber would consist of a panel of both local and international \njudges.  The panel would be composed of at least two international and three national judges, \nthe latter to include no judges from the same ethnic group.  The appeals chamber would have \nthe ability also to decide on whether it would hear a matter.32 \n \n32  Ibid., pp. 13-15. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 12 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nStructure of Appeals33 \n \n \nAppeal permitted if error \non a question of law \ninvalidating the decision \norerror of fact \noccasioning a \nmiscarriage of justice \n \nDecision of a BiH Cantonal Court or District Court \nAppeals permitted in the case of \nerror on a question of law \ninvalidating the decision or if  \nerror of fact has occasioned a \nmiscarriage of justice \n \nDecision by the IHL trial chamber \n \nDecision by the IHL trial chamber \nLeave to appeal to be permitted \n(by one Judge of Appeal) only if \ndecision of the IHL trial chamber \nclearly inconsistent with - \ninternational humanitarian law or \nwith jurisprudence of the IHL \nappeals chamber \n \nFinal decision by the IHL appeals \nchamber \n \n33  Ibid., Annex 8. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 13 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \n \nThe consultants were advised that the appointment of judges in the Court of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina would become the responsibility of an independent High Judicial Council.  \nIt seemed consistent and appropriate for this mechanism to be used for the appointment of \njudges and prosecutors to the IHL division of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The \nvetting procedure would be demanding and call for deep consultation with a number of \nactors, domestic as well as international.  The consultants considered that the involvement of \ninternational judges would only be necessary for such a period of time as necessary to \ndevelop standards to a level consistent with those expected by the international and national \ncommunity.  There should be provisions regarding the duration of the international \ncomponent.  A period of five years from the date the IHL division became operational was \nrecommended. \nTo be eligible for appointment as a judge, national members would have to possess \nconsiderable judicial experience.  Their main area of expertise should be criminal law.  For \nappointment as an international member of a panel, similar criteria should apply, together \nwith international criminal law experience.  Previous experience as a Senior Legal Adviser or \nSenior Trial Attorney with the ICTY or International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) \ncould qualify a person for appointment.  International judges would be appointed on \nconditions consistent with those for international judges in other courts in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina.  Judges appointed from within Bosnia and Herzegovina should receive the \nsame emoluments as their national counterparts in the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina34. \n \n2.2 Types of Cases \n \nThe consultants were unable to obtain reliable data as to the number of cases likely to \nconfront the courts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Whether a case would be dealt with seems \nultimately to depend upon what its characteristics are.  The consultants identified four types \nof cases, although the lines between the various categories can be quite blurred.  \n\u201cLeadership\u201d cases should remain with the ICTY, the consultants believed.  They \nwere characterised as follows: complex matters involving high-level accused, e.g., political, \nmilitary and police officials; case involving high levels of victimisation, occurring in a \ncontinuing way over an extended period of time and larger geographical areas; and cases \nmore likely than not dealing with the complex issue of command responsibility.35 \nCases of \u201cmid-level offenders, egregious cases or notorious offenders\u201d would involve \npeople who had less significant leadership roles, but who were accused of particularly \negregious or notorious acts.  This group would include military, para-military, police and \npolitical figures at a local level, now generally considered notorious war criminals by one \nethnic group and war heroes by another.  It would also include cases where it is clear that an \nentity-level court would not have the ability to deal with a notorious offender.  Also included \nin this group would be cases involving persons accused of crimes both in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and in other territories of the former Yugoslavia36. \n \n34  Ibid.,. pp. 15-16. \n35  Ibid., p. 16. \n36  Ibid. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 14 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nA third category, which would occasionally require separate considerations, related to \ncrimes of sexual violence37. \nThe fourth type of cases would involve \u201clower-level accused\u201d, accused of isolated \noffences, and cases which were not of a complex nature, generally relying on eye-witness \ntestimony which establishes whether or not the accused committed some individual acts \nfalling within the ambit of serious violations of international humanitarian law38. \nCurrently identified \u201cRules of the Road\u201d cases could fall within any of the above \ncategories. \nThe consultants considered whether it was necessary to limit the scope of war crimes \nproceedings, applying a strategy similar to the ICTY, concentrating only on the more serious \ncases, or whether there should also be a time-line according to which domestic war crimes \nproceedings should be completed.  There is no statute of limitation for war crimes in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina.  The consultants were of the view that this was appropriate and that there \nshould not be any time limitation in which cases should be heard, nor should there be any \nlimitation as to the level of cases which could be prosecuted39.  \n \n2.3 The prosecutor \n  \nThe consultants proposed that a separate IHL state prosecutor\u2019s be established within \nthe envisaged state prosecutor\u2019s office, connected to the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, \nand that relevant regulation should be included in a law on the state prosecutor.  The IHL \nprosecutor would be responsible for cases referred to Bosnia and Herzegovina by the ICTY \nand investigation and prosecution of other cases involving mid-level offenders, egregious \ncases or notorious offenders, and cases involving allegations of sexual violence.  Lower-level \noffenders could be dealt with either in the IHL division or, when so decided by the IHL \nprosecutor, in lower-level courts. \nThe IHL prosecutor would decide which cases would be pursued in the Court of \nBosnia and Herzegovina and which cases would be pursued at the entity level.  The IHL \nprosecutor would have a supervisory role in relation to entity prosecutors when they are \ninvolved in war crimes investigations or prosecutions.  According to the consultants, the first \nIHL prosecutor should be an international.  He or she should be assisted by deputy \nprosecutors as required.  Wherever possible there should be deputy prosecutors from different \nethnic groups.  The prosecutor should also have an international deputy appointed to be \nresponsible for appeals.  In due course, for instance after five years, national appointments \nshould replace both. \nThe IHL prosecutor should be independent of all domestic and international bodies, \nand stand free from, and at the same level as, the regular Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina \nProsecutor.  The composition of the IHL prosecutor\u2019s office should reflect the ethnic make-\nup of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  A state-wide parallel to the already existing system in the \nFederation that empowers the Prosecutor to decide which Cantonal Prosecutor should handle \na case, if this question arises, should be created.  Thus, the IHL prosecutor would have the \ndiscretion to decide which court should deal with a case.  In making these decisions the \n \n37  Ibid., p. 17. \n38  Ibid. \n39  Ibid., p. 17. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 15 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nprosecutor would have due regard to legal requirements and the type of case as set out earlier \nin this paper.  According to the consultants, the prosecutor\u2019s decision as to venue should be \nfinal and binding.  Legislation would have to be amended for this to occur.  The procedures \nfor appointment should be the same as for judges.   \nThe consultants were of the opinion that until their recommendations were fully \nimplemented and operational, war crimes cases being conducted locally should continue. \nCases should continue to be submitted to the ICTY Prosecutor, for assessment under the \n\u201cRules of the Road\u201d programme according to the Rome Agreement of 1996.  Once the IHL \ndivision of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the IHL prosecutor\u2019s office would have \nbecome fully operational, the \u201cRules of the Road\u201d process could be transferred to the IHL \nprosecutor.  This would be consistent with the IHL prosecutor\u2019s function of overall \nsupervision of war crimes prosecutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  It was recognised that \ninitially the volume of this task might be too great for the IHL prosecutor to take over.  The \nposition would therefore be reviewed once the IHL prosecutor\u2019s office had become \noperational and a date set for the changeover.40 \n \n2.4 Defence counsel \n \nIt is an integral part of fair and proper trials that the accused be represented by competent \ncounsel to defend his or her legal interests in court.  While an accused always has the option \nof hiring counsel, the question how to ensure that indigent accused are properly represented \nbefore the court arises.  The consultants suggested that the domestic tradition of court-\nappointed counsel should be continued.  It was noted locally that defence counsel, appointed \nex officio by the court, do not seem to defend accused with the same vigour as counsel hired \ndirectly. There may be several reasons for this but in order to ensure proper defence in the \ncases in question the consultants recommended that funds should be available to pay court \nappointed counsel through a defence trust fund; and that a public defenders support unit \nshould be established.  \nIn order to ensure a consistent and qualified defence, it was considered necessary to \ndevelop a set of rules regulating, as a minimum, financial requirements for determination of \nindigent status, authority to appoint counsel; minimum professional requirements; the ability \nof an accused to object to and reject court appointed counsel; and misconduct of counsel, \nincluding failure to show up in court and failure to adhere to generally accepted professional \ndefence standards.  A decision to refuse a request to appoint defence counsel should be \nsubject to appeal.  Misconduct of counsel should, after warning, lead to refusal of  audience.  \nIt was envisaged that the public defenders support unit should consist of five persons of \nwhom two should be internationals while the remaining three should be nationals, attorneys \nand support staff.  The consultants did not suggest that the public defenders support unit \nrepresent clients in court but merely provide support and advice to court-appointed defence \nattorneys regarding international humanitarian law issues, including ICTY practice.  \nEssentially this would be an expanded version of the service currently provided by the ICTY \nOutreach Programme.41 \n \n \n40  Ibid., pp.18-19. \n41  Ibid., pp. 19-20. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 16 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \n2.5 The registrar \n \nThe consultants recommended the establishment of a registry and appointment of a \nregistrar, assisted by suitable personnel, to carry out the following functions: organisation of \nthe smooth running of the chambers; registration of documents related to court proceedings; \ninformation systems management; archiving; assistance and technical support to the \nchambers and the prosecutor\u2019s office; administrative control of the witness protection unit; \nadministrative control of the court police; maintenance of a law library, in collaboration with \nICTY; and language services. \nThe consultants were advised that the court registries in Bosnia and Herzegovina had \nvery limited competencies.  Due to the very nature of war crimes cases the consultants \ndeemed it necessary to establish an independent registry for the purpose of dealing with \nnumerous practical and legal aspects pertaining to handling of evidence, witnesses, etc.  They \nfelt that these duties should not be the responsibility of the courts or the prosecutor\u2019s office.  \nIt was proposed that the first Registrar be an international appointment.42 \n \n2.6 War crimes cases within the domestic court system \n \nIt was recommended that trials for war crimes of lower level accused be limited to \nnominated Cantonal or District Courts, and only as referred by the Court of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina IHL prosecutor.  Banja Luka, Mostar, Sarajevo, and Brcko are recommended \nfor such nomination.  \nAt the Bosnia and Herzegovina level there is a Human Rights Chamber, a \nConstitutional Court and the above-mentioned Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is \nnot yet operational.  There is international representation in both the Human Rights Chamber \nand the Constitutional Court. \nFor the Federation, there are fifty-two Municipal Courts, five Cantonal Courts, a \nSupreme Court, and a Constitutional Court.  War crimes prosecutions could take place in first \ninstance in Municipal Courts in some Cantons, but mostly in the Cantonal Courts.  This \nsituation was deemed too complex;; there were too many courts to allow war crimes cases \nand witness protection to be dealt with in a secure and consistent manner across the entire \ncourt system.  It was recommended that trials for war crimes of lower level accused be \nlimited to nominated Cantonal Courts, e.g., Mostar and Sarajevo, and only as referred by the \nCourt of Bosnia and Herzegovina IHL prosecutor. \nIn the Republika Srpska there are twenty-five Basic Courts, five District Courts, a \nSupreme Court, and a Constitutional Court.  As with the Federation, this was considered too \ncomplex to allow war crimes cases and witness protection to be dealt with in a secure and \nconsistent manner across the entire court system.  It was recommended that trials for war \ncrimes of lower level accused be limited to one District Court, preferably Banja Luka, as \nreferred by the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina IHL prosecutor. \nThe new judicial model in the Brcko District has a court system, which comprises a \nfirst instance Basic Court and a second instance Appellate Court.  The Court of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina will be a third instance court.  It was recommended that the Brcko second \n \n42  Ibid., pp. 20-21. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 17 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \ninstance court deal with war crimes cases if referred by the IHL prosecutor.  Appeals would \nlie to the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina IHL division.43 \n \n2.7 Bosnian law, and its relationship to the ICTY \n \nThe consultants considered it preferable that, to the extent possible, the provisions set \nup in domestic legislation should serve as a basis for new or amended legislation.  When not \nsufficient, amendments to existing legislation or creation of new regulations were \nrecommended.  Provisions should also take into account developments in the law as applied \nin the ICTY.  The Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Criminal Codes and Criminal \nProcedure Codes of the Federation, Republika Srpska and the Brcko District should be \namended to include consistent provisions regarding war crimes. \nThe jurisprudence of the ICTY should be persuasive authority in procedural, as well \nas criminal matters, in the interpretation of legislation by Bosnia and Herzegovina courts on \nall levels. However, the consultants realised that the differences between the legal systems \nwould make an obligation for local courts to follow the jurisprudence of the Tribunal \ncompletely impossible.  A regulation stating that the courts should take into account the \njurisprudence of the Tribunal was recommended.  The consultants also recommended that the \ntemporal jurisdiction should commence on 1 January 1991 as with the ICTY.  The territorial \njurisdiction should be limited to conduct within the borders now recognised as being those of \nBosnia and Herzegovina. \nProvisions should be enacted to allow abbreviated proceedings where the accused \nadmits guilt and it is in the interest of justice to limit the amount of evidence taken.  Where \nthe accused has contributed substantially to expediting the proceedings, either by admitting \nguilt in his or her own case, or by providing reliable and cogent testimony in proceedings \nagainst others, he or she should be entitled to a substantial discount in sentence. \nOnce established, the first task of the judges of the IHL division of the Court of \nBosnia and Herzegovina would be to prepare a Book of Rules for the Chambers under the \nrelevant domestic legislation.  A substantial list of changes to domestic legislation , including \nboth amendments and a number of new statutes, would also be required.44 \nVarious rules have been implemented by the ICTY to facilitate receiving testimony in \nan efficient and effective way and to avoid the need to call multiple witnesses in some cases, \nor the same witnesses over and over again in cases against different accused.  To the extent \npossible, these measures should be adopted, according to the consultants.. \nThe rights of the accused in Bosnia and Herzegovina are already guaranteed under the \nConstitution and are an integral part of domestic law.  The Bosnia and Herzegovina Criminal \nProcedure Code should, in the view of the consultants, be consistent with all the rights given \nsuspects under the ICTY Rules 42 and 43.  Rule 43, for example, requires the electronic \nrecording of suspect interviews.  Although this would necessitate the purchase of expensive \nrecording equipment, it was felt to be warranted.  Interviews conducted in this manner should \nbe admissible as evidence.  The accused should have the right to defence counsel, both at \ninterview and at trial. \n \n43  Ibid., pp. 21-22. \n44  Ibid., Annex 14 (on file with the author) provides a list of the relevant legislation requiring amendment \nand the new legislation that will be required. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 18 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nCases involving conduct both in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other republics of the \nformer Yugoslavia should remain with the ICTY.  The jurisdiction of the IHL division of the \nCourt of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the entity courts and Brcko District court should be \nconcurrent.  As set out above, the IHL prosecutor would decide at the outset whether a matter \nwas to be tried in the IHL division or at the entity or Brcko level.  The IHL prosecutor would \nhave the right to intervene in local proceedings under certain circumstances, in the same way \nthat the ICTY can intervene in national war crimes cases.  \nIn the view of the consultants, provisions should be enacted to allow shortened \nproceedings where the accused admits guilt and it is in the interest of justice to limit the \namount of evidence taken.  Where the accused has contributed substantially in expediting \nproceedings, either by admitting guilt in his or her own case, or by providing reliable and \ncogent testimony in proceedings against others, he or she should be entitled to a substantial \nreduction in sentence.  A procedure for guilty pleas does not exist in the Federation or in \nRepublika Srpska.  The Federation Criminal Procedure Code contains a regulation (article \n218) to the effect that the authority conducting the procedure has a duty to gather other \nevidence even though the accused has confessed.  A similar regulation is in place in the \nRepublika Srpska Criminal Procedure Code (Article 223).  This regulation is an example of \n\u201cthe principle of the material truth\u201d, which seemed to have deep roots in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. \nHowever, the consultants opined that if the confession was clear and complete, and \nwas corroborated by other evidence, further investigation should only be undertaken on the \nrecommendation of the prosecutor.  In the Brcko Criminal Procedure Code (article 156), \nthere are provisions on the acceptance of guilty pleas similar to those in the ICTY Rules of \nProcedure and Evidence.  These should be considered.  In the IHL division of the Court of \nBosnia and Herzegovina and in entity level courts, confessions of guilt should be regarded as \nan additional piece of evidence, which together with a sufficient factual basis, establishing \nthat the crime occurred and that the participation of the accused may in itself lead to a \nconviction.  The principle of the material truth at present puts on the court an obligation to \ntake part very actively in the collection of evidence in a way that might at least be seen as \nhaving an influence on its impartiality.  With the creation of a relatively strong prosecutorial \norganisation in the Bosnia and Herzegovina criminal procedure system, the validity of the \nprinciple is being reassessed.45 \nThis is yet another example of legal colonialism, supplemented by ignorance of the \ncivil law approach, by representatives of the common law systems, as it is clearly intended to \nsteer the judiciary towards embracing an adversarial model of some kind.  A French judge \nwho worked in Kosovo has criticised the phenomenon, as he saw it in action there, \nchallenging the massive influence of American lawyers \u201c[i]gnorant superbement la tradition \njuridique continentale et voulant imposer leurs propres standards\u201d.46 \n \n2.8 Protective measures for witnesses \n \nThe consultants recommended the adoption of a wide range of protective measures for \nwitnesses involved in war crimes cases, to be based on a threat assessment.  Psychosocial \n \n45  Ibid., pp. 22-25. \n46  PATRICE DE CHARETTE, LES OISEAUX NOIRS DU KOSOVO, UN JUGE A PRISTINA 50-51 (2002). \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 19 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nsupport for witnesses was recommended.  The implementation of these measures would \nrequire the establishment of a professional witness protection and support unit.  Robust \ncriminal sanctions should also be in place to deal with any attempts to interfere with \nwitnesses. \nPre-trial protective measures would include: ensuring during the investigation process \nthat it is not widely known that a witness has participated in an investigation; non-disclosure \nof the name and address of the witness until shortly before proceedings; orders not to \ninterfere with witnesses; orders for defendants and their legal counsel not to disclose the \nidentity of witnesses; notification of local police officials that a witness is under threat, \n(provided there is a clear commitment to respond urgently to any overt threats received by the \nwitness); use of electronic devices within the witness\u2019s home or work place, to alert police in \ncases of emergency; close personal protection in extreme cases; various forms of relocation \n(temporary or permanent) until the nature of the threat subsides; other measures as \nappropriate. \nOnce a trial commences, protective measures, similar to those utilised in the ICTY, \ncould be adopted.  The aim of these measures would be to create a regime where members of \nthe public and officials alike would become aware that any improper interference with the \njudicial process would not be tolerated.47 \nIt appears probable that witnesses in war crimes cases will be called from either \nentity.  Often, witnesses from one ethnic group would be called for the prosecution and from \nanother group for the defence. There have been numerous reports of extreme difficulties in \nsummoning witnesses across entity boundaries, and for the Brcko District from either entity.  \nMeasures are needed to address this.  The present agreements or regulations on inter-entity \nco-operation and co-operation with the Brcko District were not considered sufficient for the \npurpose of handling war crimes cases.  Without a legal obligation for full co-operation, there \nwould be no substantial basis for advancing war crimes cases in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  \nThere should not only be an obligation on judicial co-operation and co-operation for other \nofficial agencies with the judiciary, but also strong legal remedies for those not fulfilling the \nobligations.  According to the consultants, new agreements involving the state as well as the \nentities and the Brcko District should be negotiated which would guarantee fully effective co-\noperation48. \n \n2.9 Issues regarding transfer of cases \n \nThe consultants were of the opinion that a formula must be established for remitting \ncases from the ICTY to the IHL division of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  This could \ninclude a joint consideration by the ICTY Prosecutor and the IHL prosecutor, taking into \naccount factors such as: complexity of the case; witness availability and the number of \nwitnesses who reside outside Bosnia and Herzegovina; whether substantial issues in the case \nhave already been resolved in the ICTY; command responsibility issues involved in the case; \nlocal factors which may affect decisions on venue; possible delays in commencing the trial \nand whether the accused would receive an earlier trial at ICTY; remaining investigative \n \n47  \u201cConsultants\u2019 Report to the OHR, The Future of Domestic War Crimes Prosecutions in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina\u201d, supra note 25, pp. 25-28. \n48  Ibid., pp. 28-29. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 20 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nactivity before trial can commence; measures necessary to ensure that remitted cases would \nbe carried out in a manner acceptable to ICTY; whether the case raises issues of territorial \njurisdiction, for example, if the accused is alleged to have committed crimes in other \nrepublics of the former Yugoslavia. \nThe accused should also be entitled to make submissions on whether his or her case \nshould be remitted to Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The final decision would rest with a Judge of \na Trial Chamber of the ICTY.  The question was raised as to whether a facilitating agreement \nbetween the ICTY and Bosnia and Herzegovina would be necessary for cases to be \ntransferred to the IHL division.  As the ICTY and Bosnia and Herzegovina have concurrent \njurisdiction with regard to prosecution of war crimes cases, and further, having regard to \nproposed amendments to the Rule 11bis of the ICTY\u2019s Rules of Evidence and Procedure, it \nwas felt that a facilitating agreement would not be necessary to allow a transfer to take place. \nThe ICTY proposed that after arrest of an accused it had indicted, the case could be \nsuspended and transferred to a court in Bosnia and Herzegovina for trial. Reaching the \nindictment stage signalled the starting point for trials in both the ICTY and in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina.  The standard for reaching an indictment at the ICTY appeared to be similar to \nthat which will be required in the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  This led the consultants \nto the conclusion that if the ICTY were to transfer a case after indictment, it would be at a \nsimilar stage to a case after indictment in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  A significant issue to be \nresolved related to the material to be provided by the ICTY to the Court of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina when a case was referred to it.  It was anticipated that along with the accused \nand the indictment, the ICTY would forward the Prosecutor\u2019s pre-trial brief,49 witness lists \nand statements, exhibit lists and exhibits, including documentary evidence, video evidence, \nphotographs and other physical evidence, depositions of witnesses who have given evidence \nin other trials involving the same facts or before presiding officer, and judicial decisions \nregarding those facts. \nThere was considerable concern whether the material gathered by the ICTY would be \nadmissible before a court in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  National judges and prosecutors were \nsaid not to be used to receiving cases in this format and would require considerable guidance \non how to use the materials, and legislative action might be required in order to facilitate this.  \nAt a minimum, judicial guidelines would need to be prepared to assist the judiciary in \ndetermining these questions.  Confidentiality issues relating to material obtained by the ICTY \nwould have to be addressed, particularly where evidence emanated from material provided \nunder Rule 70 of the ICTY\u2019s Rules of Procedure and Evidence, which concerns evidence not \nsubject to disclosure.50 \n \n \n49  This would appear to be at odds with the procedural sequence at the ICTY, because the pre-trial brief is \nfiled by the Prosecutor only close to the trial date.  If the time of decision is the indictment stage, there \nwill usually be no pre-trial brief, and the prosecution before the Bosnian court may well form \ncompletely different views on the facts and the law than the ICTY prosecutors.  \n50  \u201cConsultants\u2019 Report to the OHR, The Future of Domestic War Crimes Prosecutions in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina\u201d, supra note 25, pp. 30-32. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 21 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \n2.10 Investigations, arrests, sentences and their enforcement \n \nIt was recommended that an investigations unit be established within the Prosecutor\u2019s \nOffice to carry out war crimes investigations.  The investigations unit should be free of the \nconstraints currently hindering inter-entity co-operation.  In short, it would have to be capable \nof conducting investigations and other related tasks across the whole of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, irrespective of where the activity is to take place.  The proposed court will not \nfunction without a mechanism to enforce its decisions.  Therefore, the consultants \nrecommended the establishment of a court police, similar to the system operating in the \nFederation, for execution of orders of the court for attendance of witnesses, arrest of accused \nand persons to be sentenced, and maintenance of order and security in the courtroom and in \nthe court premises.51  The consultants also recommended that sentences be served in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina.  Such sentences should be in accordance with the applicable law of the \nentity where the sentence is served, subject to the supervision of the trial or appeals chamber \nof the IHL division.52 \n \n2.11 The Truth and Reconciliation Commission  \n \nThe relationship between the IHL division and the proposed Truth and Reconciliation \nCommission (TRC) was said to be difficult to define.  The purpose of the TRC is to provide a \nforum for victims to tell their story and to establish, without apportioning guilt, the horrific \nevents, which occurred in the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  If the experience of \nprevious similar commissions could be a guide, disclosures at the TRC would precipitate \ncalls for judicial action concerning certain events.  Further, matters that would come to light \nin the TRC might well be forwarded to the IHL prosecutor for investigation, or alternatively, \nthe IHL prosecutor might deem it his or her responsibility to track TRC proceedings and \ninitiate investigations where warranted.  From either perspective this could increase the work \nof the IHL prosecutor and ultimately increase the work of the IHL division.53 \n \n2.12 Budget and funding  \n \nWhen examining the various options for the establishment of the IHL division, the \nconsultants found that there were essentially two hypotheses.  A \u201cbest case scenario,\u201d where \nthe proposed budget and model was adopted in full, and was fully funded, and a \u201cmodest but \nwill suffice\u201d version, based on either the deletion of certain elements or their acquisition at \nbelow cost.  Detailed budgets and funding requirements were outlined for each of these \nscenarios.54  The cost of the first option was calculated at \u20ac4,818,000 to establish and then \n\u20ac6,532,650 to run the IHL division for the first year.  If three trial panels were established \ninstead of one, the cost would increase to approximately \u20ac11,632,450 per year.  The cost \nestimates are adjustable.  The single most expensive cost is establishment of the infrastructure \nof courtrooms, office space and computer networks.  Starting from scratch, offices, court \n \n51  Ibid., pp. 32-34. \n52  Ibid., pp. 34-35. \n53  Ibid., p. 37. \n54  Ibid., Annex 4 (on file with the author). \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 22 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nmodification costs, information technology and office equipment would total approximately \n\u20ac6 million. \nThe other large item was salaries for international staff.  In order to attract competent \nand dedicated professionals, preferably for a medium to long-term period, salaries would \nhave to be internationally competitive.  On the other hand, seconded staff could reduce the \nneed for external funding.  However, in order to ensure continuity and strong leadership the \nconsultants strongly recommended keeping seconded staff to a minimum and ensuring that \nfunding was in place for at least all top-level international employees before the process is \ninitiated.  With regard to national staff, the budget was based on salary scales for nationals \nemployed by international organisations.  This was obviously higher than what public \nofficials in Bosnia and Herzegovina were paid.  However without significant financial \nincentives it is open to question whether the IHL division would be able to attract proper and \nqualified professionals.55 \n \n2.13 Implementation  \n \nThe consultants prepared a proposed time line for implementation of these \nrecommendations that projected the start of the first trial within 180 days.56  As preliminaries, \nthe OHR would have to establish a management board with the participation of \nrepresentatives of stakeholders, securing of adequate funding, and appointment of a project \nmanager.  Crucial components that would also have to be in place before this process could \nbegin would include enactment of legal provisions to establish and operate the IHL division, \nincluding adoption of new legislation as amendments of relevant laws (Law on the Court of \nBosnia and Herzegovina, Criminal Codes, Criminal Procedure Codes, Laws on Prosecutors \nand other legislation).  Suitable premises would have to be acquired. \n \nIII. THE ICTY REPORT OF JUNE 2002 \n \nThe ICTY Report of June 2002,57 in which \u2013 despite the obvious involvement of \nICTY staff in its preparation and the developments prior to the ICTY report \u2013 the President \ndeclared that the OHR report of May 2002 had not been taken into account,58 dealt with a \nnumber of problems related to the functioning of the ICTY, and especially with the deferral \nof cases to courts in Bosnia.  The ICTY acknowledged the gradual restoration of democratic \ninstitutions in Bosnia and the increase in the number of arrests of high-ranking accused, and, \nwhile in the beginning the referral of cases to the courts in the former Yugoslavia was \ninconceivable, partly because some of them were still at war, that with the return to peace and \nthe reforms of the judicial systems, implementation of a referral process was said to be an \n\u201cincreasingly likely prospect\u201d.59  The Tribunal emphasised the need to ensure that the \n \n55  Ibid., pp.40-41. \n56  Ibid., Annex 13 (on file with the author). \n57  \u201cReport on the Judicial Status of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the \nProspects for Referring Certain Cases to National Courts\u201d, available on the ICTY website as an \nappendix to the press release of 20 June 2000, SB\/P.I.S.\/512-e. \n58  Ibid., para. 59. \n59  Ibid., para. 2. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 23 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nnational courts had the necessary resources for taking on such cases and that they operate \nfairly and with respect for the principles of international humanitarian law and the protection \nof human rights.60 \nThe report was split into two main parts, a statistical evaluation of the activity of the \nOffice of the Prosecutor and the Chambers, in order to determine the scope of the referral \nprocess, and a presentation of the main obstacles to the referral of cases to the national courts \nof Bosnia and Herzegovina and the necessary reforms in order to overcome them.61  The first \npart is not discussed here, because it only set out the reasons why the ICTY had to consider \nreferral and how many cases could be referred. \nThe ICTY estimated that several persons detained by the Tribunal and possibly fifty \npotential future defendants could be referred to national courts.  They were mainly persons \nwho had held intermediate-level positions between the principal military and political leaders \nindicted and tried by the Tribunal and the low-ranking subordinates indicted and tried by the \nnational courts.  Pursuant to the terms of the Rome Agreement of 18 February 1996, by June \n2000, the Prosecutor had received 1,266 files concerning 4,045 suspects from the local \nauthorities, and had examined approximately 700 files concerning about 2,500 suspects.62  \n\u201cIntermediary-level accused\u201d according to the Report, in a somewhat circular definition, \nmeant those in a position of authority sufficiently high-ranking to warrant being indicted by \nthe Prosecutor of the Tribunal - and accordingly, the indictment would be issued by the ICTY \nProsecutor and confirmed by a Judge of the Tribunal \u2013 and who could be tried by national \ncourts provided that the national courts comply fully with internationally recognised \nstandards of human rights and due process.63 \nThe ICTY recalled64 the words of the Secretary-General\u2019s report of 3 May 1993 that: \n\u201cit was not the intention of the Security Council to preclude or prevent the exercise of \njurisdiction by national courts with respect to [serious violations of international \nhumanitarian law]. Indeed national courts should be encouraged to exercise their jurisdiction \nin accordance with their relevant national laws and procedures\u201d.65  It also referred to the \nPreamble of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court \u201cthat it is the duty of every \nState to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes\u201d and \n\u201cthat the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole must not \ngo unpunished and that their effective prosecution must be ensured by taking measures at the \nnational level and by enhancing international cooperation\u201d.  \nThe implementation of the referral process was considered to require amendments to \nthe Statute and a reformulation of Rule 11bis of the Rules, and possibly the signing of a co-\noperation agreement between the Tribunal and the national authorities.66  At the \nextraordinary plenary session of 23 April 2002, the Judges had noted that the Statute \ncontained some ambiguities as to the extent of the Tribunal\u2019s power to refer cases to national \n \n60  Ibid., para. 4. \n61  Ibid., para. 9. \n62  Ibid., para. 31. \n63  Ibid., para. 32. \n64  Ibid., para. 33. \n65  \u201cReport of the Secretary-General established pursuant to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution \n808 (1993)\u2019, 3 May 1993, UN Doc.

They suggested that the Security Council resolve the issue by passing a resolution \namending the Statute.  They were not certain whether the provisions of article 29 of the \nStatute - which impose on all the member States a general obligation to co-operate with the \nTribunal - could be interpreted as allowing the Tribunal to compel national courts to try the \npersons who would be referred, whilst respecting the indictments issued by the Prosecutor.  \nNor was it clear that article 9 of the Statute - which establish the principles of concurrent \njurisdiction and the primacy of the Tribunal - could be interpreted as authorising the Tribunal \nto implement a more far-reaching referral process than the one set out in the Rules at the \ntime.  The current version of Rule 11bis of the Rules made provision only for the suspension \nof an indictment, under certain conditions, if the case was pending before the\nTo implement a truly effective referral process, the judges thought that the scope of \nthe application of this Rule had to be broadened,67 with several aims, including allowing \ncertain cases to be referred to the courts of the State on whose territory the crimes were \ncommitted,68 authorising the referral of cases involving accused not in the custody of the \nTribunal69 and making it possible for the Tribunal to ensure that the accused be tried by \nnational courts for all the crimes specified in the indictments.70  The Rule should also enable \nthe Tribunal to compel the national judicial authorities to respect the protective measures \nordered for victims and witnesses.71  The Rules is were at that time silent as to the level of \nresponsibility required for an accused to be prosecuted in a national court.  It was \nacknowledged that this level was not easy to determine in the abstract, particularly in the \ncontext of a conflict which involved both leaders of States or autonomous entities and civilian \nand paramilitary groups.  However, for reasons of transparency vis-\u00e0-vis the international \ncommunity and, more particularly, the States of the former Yugoslavia, in addition to the \nability of the national courts to conform to international standards, the Tribunal wanted to \ntake into consideration the position of the accused and the gravity of the crimes with which \nthey were charged.  It was to be for the Tribunal to assess and set out in concreto the main \npoints of those criteria.72  The Judges also wanted the Rule to authorise the competent Trial \nChamber to decide ex officio to refer a case after having given the Prosecutor and, where \napplicable, the accused the opportunity to be heard. \nThe Prosecutor objected to the fact that a Trial Chamber could decide ex officio to \nrefer a case, as this would infringe upon the powers conferred on her by the Statute.  \nHowever, Rule 11bis of the Rules current at the time already gave a Trial Chamber the right \nto act ex officio.73  The Prosecutor believed at the time that Bosnia was the only country that \ncould be considered for the referral process.74 \nThe report briefly described the steps the authorities of Bosnia  had taken with respect \nto reforming their judicial system, namely incorporating violations of the law of war into the \ncriminal codes, bringing the codes of criminal procedure into line with international \nconventions on the protection of human rights, reinforcing the procedural guarantees during \n \n67  Ibid., para. 37. \n68  Ibid., para. 38. \n69  Ibid., para. 39. \n70  Ibid., para. 40. \n71  Ibid., para. 41. \n72  Ibid., para. 42. \n73  Ibid., para. 43. \n74  Ibid., para. 45. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 25 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \nthe preliminary investigation, judicial examination and trial, harmonising the rules of \nevidence with the requirements of a fair trial, adopting measures to guarantee the status and \nindependence of the judiciary, and adopting a code of professional conduct for the \njudiciary.75 \nThe report described the main obstacles to referral proceedings: risk of dependency and \npartiality of the judiciary; lack or ineffectiveness of witness protection provisions; lack of \ntraining of the judiciary and law professionals; insufficient financial and logistical resources; \nslowness of the judicial system; incomplete compatibility of national substantive law with \ninternational law.76  According to the report, these obstacles could be overcome in several \nways.  The local judges, prosecutors and court personnel could receive additional training in \ninternational criminal law and human rights.

Although it does not allow for \na substantial reform of the \njudicial system, the solution does \nhowever have many considerable \nadvantages in the specific \ncontext of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina (see column 1). \n \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 27 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \nUse of the State Court  The solution \n \n1. makes it possible to use a \nlocal judicial institution \ncurrently being established; \n2. contributes towards \nencouraging the effort to build \nthe State by the State itself; \n3. makes it possible to set in \nplace a uniform practice for \npunishing perpetrators of war \ncrimes, that is to say, one used \nState-wide; \n4. can be set in place in a short \ntime. \nThe solution \n \n1. requires national legislation \nto be reworked in order to \nestablish a specialised \nchamber at the court \nconcerned; \n2. creates a difference between \nthe jurisdictions and powers of \nthe Court and the Tribunal, \nwhich are distinct; \n3. might bring about a lack of \nconsistency between the \nprocedure applied at the \nTribunal and that at the State \nCourt;  \n4. does not best guarantee the \navailability and qualifications \nof the personnel assigned. \n1.

This involves: \n(a) the adoption of a Security \nCouncil resolution; and (b) an \namendment of the national \nconstitution which would give \nrise to long and complicated \nprocedures; \n2. would make it necessary to \nuse a criminal procedure \ngreatly different and far \nremoved from the local \njudicial traditions; \n3. would require considerable \ntime to set up an institution of \nthis kind; \n4. would compel the \ninternational community to \nassume a considerable \nfinancial burden. \n5. would be tantamount to not \nencouraging some of the \nnecessary local reforms; \n6. would prevent national \njudges from trying war \ncriminals as they would defer \nto international judges. \n1. Using a single court fully \nadapted to trying international \ncrimes seems very attractive. \n2. Nonetheless, the establishment \nof an international court in \nBosnia and Herzegovina does not \nseem appropriate since it in no \nway contributes towards the \nreform of the judicial system \nsought. \n \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 28 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nWhich model was the most appropriate depended primarily on the specific nature of \nthe cases likely to be referred.  Even if by definition a special international court was \nperfectly adapted to trying war crimes and crimes against humanity, the option of setting one \nup presented three major disadvantages.  First, it could not be operational immediately since \nit would require the Security Council to pass a resolution, which could not be taken for \ngranted.  The court would also be extremely expensive, as this would amount to setting up a \n\u201cmini-International Tribunal\u201d in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Lastly, the solution would add a \nfurther court to Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s already greatly complex judicial scene.79 \nThe State Court appeared to the ICTY to be more conducive to reconciling the \nspecific requirement of punishing war crimes and crimes against humanity with the \nparticularities of Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s judicial system.  Among the many advantages of \nusing this Court, was the fact that it conformed fully with the provisions of the constitution, \naccording to which the State had exclusive jurisdiction in matters of international criminal \nlaw and that, in September 2001, the Constitutional Court found that the creation of the State \nCourt was consistent with the Constitution.  Furthermore, with the State Court it would be \npossible to guarantee that all areas of law were uniform on a national level as well as to \nresolve the excessive compartmentalisation of the judicial system between the two entities, \nwhich had been particularly apparent in the prosecution and trial of war crimes.80  Using the \nState Court was thought to avoid having to set up an additional court whilst also supporting \nthe effort to build the State by the State itself.  This was seen as an essential advantage \nbecause all the observers and players involved in the judicial system of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina agreed that any reform of the judicial system\u2019s structures could produce results \nonly if it was consonant with the legal traditions of the State and carried out in close co-\noperation with the existing judicial authorities.81  The district and cantonal courts could assist \nthe work of the State Court, which alone would not be able to try the very large number of \nwar crimes cases.  In addition to all the cases involving intermediate-level accused which \nshould be referred by the Tribunal pursuant to Rule 11 bis of the Rules, there were all those \ninvolving subordinates which the national courts were hearing in accordance with the Rome \nAgreement which numbered around several hundred.82 \nThe process advocated by the ICTY was considered as precluding a complete \nupheaval of the judiciary in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Although new structures would have to \nbe established, it was important to work with the existing judicial institutions and organs as \nthey constituted irreplaceable reference points for the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  \nThe State Court should handle only those cases involving intermediary-level accused which \nhad been referred by the Tribunal, as well as the cases over which the district and cantonal \ncourts would ordinarily have jurisdiction but whose sensitive nature required that they be \ntried on the national level, an assessment which should be made by the prosecutor of the \nCourt.  In addition, the State Court could hear appeals against cantonal and district court \ndecisions. Lastly, international observers should monitor the conduct of proceedings before \nthe district and cantonal courts responsible for trying subordinates in accordance with the \n \n79  Ibid., paras. 60-61. \n80  Ibid., paras. 63-64. \n81  Ibid.,  para. 65. \n82  Ibid.,  para. 66. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 29 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nRome Agreement in order to ensure that they conformed with the most fundamental \nguarantees of the criminal trial83.

The participation of the national courts in trying war criminals presupposed that \nthey were in a position to make impartial and independent rulings, in accordance with the \nprinciples laid down in the Statute.  As such, the authorities concerned should adopt general \nprovisions inherent to the proper functioning of any judicial system, as well as more specific \nprovisions in order to make it possible to punish war crimes and crimes against humanity.  \nThis meant that Bosnia and Herzegovina would have to adopt general provisions in order to \nensure fully the impartiality and independence of the judiciary and, in particular, prevent the \npolitical authorities from being able to interfere in investigations.  Moreover, it would have to \nmake certain that arrest and pre-trial detention are covered by guarantees, ensure that trials \nare fair, make sure that the accused and detainees are treated equally without regard to their \nnationality, political views or religious beliefs, respect the minimum criteria for the detention \nconditions of detainees and convicted persons, and abolish the death penalty and preclude any \npossible means of reintroducing it. \nIt was also considered necessary to adapt the existing national laws to the over-riding \nneeds of punishing war crimes and crimes against humanity by sending international judges \nto serve in the courts responsible for trying cases referred by the Tribunal, making the \nnational judiciary more familiar with the rules of international criminal law, through training, \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 31 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nadapting certain aspects of internal criminal procedure to the requirements of international \ncriminal procedure, especially for the protection of victims and witnesses, and ensuring that \nall the serious violations of international humanitarian law established under articles 2 to 5 of \nthe Tribunal\u2019s Statute and the principles governing individual criminal responsibility \nembodied in article 7 are provided for in internal criminal law.85 \nThe Report concluded with the recommendations to the UN Security Council.  In \norder to wind down its mission \u2013 that is to complete its investigations around 2004 and its \nfirst instance trials around 2008 \u2013 the Tribunal had to further concentrate its activity on the \nprosecution and trial of the highest-ranking political and military leaders and refer \nintermediary-level accused, even if they are not yet in the custody of the Tribunal, to the \nnational courts, principally, those of Bosnia and Herzegovina.86  So as to implement this two-\npronged process of \u201cconcentration\u201d and \u201creferral\u201d, the Tribunal intended to take certain \nmeasures in order to ensure that the accused answer in the national courts for all the crimes \nspecified in the indictments brought by the Prosecutor and confirmed by the judges of the \nTribunal, the national courts respect the protective measures ordered by the Tribunal for the \nvictims and witnesses, and the national trials are conducted in accordance with the \ninternational norms for the protection of human rights.87 \nWith this in mind, the Tribunal recommended that a Chamber with the jurisdiction to \ntry the accused referred by the Tribunal be established within the State Court of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina.  It suggested that international judges serve alongside the national judges in the \nState Court for at least a certain period.  It proposed that the local prosecutors, judges and \ncourt personnel receive training in international humanitarian law.  It considered the \npossibility of having international observers ensure that the proceedings instigated in the \ndistrict and cantonal courts pursuant to the Rome Agreement (\u201cRules of the Road\u201d) would be \nconducted properly.88. \nThe Report closed with a programme of action which called for the holding of a \ndiplomatic seminar in The Hague to present the report to the diplomats serving in The \nNetherlands.  This was to be followed by adoption of amendments to the Rules in order to \nexpedite proceedings further, submission of the report to the members of the Security Council \nand, by the first quarter of 2003, implementation of the process for referring cases to national \ncourts.89 \n \nIV. SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS \n \nAs indicated in the action plan of the June 2002 ICTY Report, Claude Jorda and Carla \ndel Ponte visited Bosnia from 17 to 21 June 2002 to discuss the implementation of its \nrecommendations.90  This was followed by the third diplomatic seminar at the ICTY on 27 \nJune 2002, when Jorda, del Ponte and the Registrar, Hans Holthuis, briefed the diplomatic \ncommunity in the Hague on the aims of the completion strategy and the June 2002 Report. \n \n85  Ibid.,  paras. 70-73. \n86  Ibid.,  para. 83. \n87  Ibid.,  para. 84. \n88  Ibid.,  para. 85. \n89  Ibid.,  para. 87. \n90  Press release of 14 June 2002, JdH\/P.I.S.\/681-e. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 32 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nOn 26 July 2002, after another plenary on 11 and 12 July 2002, Claude Jorda spoke \nagain before the Security Council about the exit strategy.91  The Prosecutor, he said, had \nreviewed the investigations underway to determine the number of persons who should be \ntried by the ICTY and those who should be tried on the national level.  She estimated that of \nthe approximately one hundred individuals to be indicted by 2004, fifty might be tried by the \ncourts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  A number of persons already indicted by the ICTY who \nmight already be referred to the national courts of that country would have to be added to this \nfigure.  She considered that these were principally intermediate-level accused hierarchically \nfalling between the main leaders indicted and tried by the Tribunal and the minor actors \nindicted and tried by the national courts.  President Jorda asked the Council to exert all its \ninfluence with the Member States, particularly in the former Yugoslavia, to arrest the accused \nin their territory, especially the high-ranking political and military leaders, and transfer them \nto the ICTY. \nPrior to implementing a referral process, he stated that the ICTY needed to be sure \nthat the Statute mandated it to take all the measures necessary to this end.  At the \nextraordinary plenary session of 23 April 2002, the Judges had observed that the Statute \ncontained some ambiguities regarding the extent of the ICTY\u2019s powers to refer cases to \nnational courts.  As the texts then stood, it was not certain that the ICTY was authorised to \nimplement a referral process whose scope extends beyond that then provided for by Rule \n11bis of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  He also pointed out the difficulties still \nremaining.  Despite the gradual re-establishment of democratic institutions and the return to \npeace in the country, the local courts were still faced with significant structural difficulties.  \nThese were said to arise mainly from the excessive compartmentalisation of the judicial \nsystems of the Federation and the Republika Srpska, the lack of co-operation between the two \nentities, the political influence brought to bear on judges and prosecutors, the often \u201cmono-\nethnic\u201d composition of the local courts, the difficulty of protecting victims and witnesses \neffectively and the court personnel\u2019s lack of training and the backlog of cases at the courts.  \nPresident Jorda admitted that the OHR had embarked upon far-reaching reforms of the \njudicial system.  Although it would not be possible to complete this process for some years, \nthe ICTY could begin referring certain cases as early as 2003, and thus a transitional solution \nwould have to be found.  It would consist of establishing within the State Court of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina a chamber with special jurisdiction to try serious violations of international \nhumanitarian law.  He stressed that this plan was supported by the members of the Presidency \nof Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The applicable procedure should be the one in force in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina and not an international procedure, which would be complex, and constitute \nan amalgam of the civil and common law traditions.  Additionally, the local judges and \nprosecutors, most staff members, defence counsel and the accused would find it especially \neasy to use the \u201clocal\u201d procedure as they were already familiar with it.  The trials of \nindividuals accused of war crimes would be more in keeping with the legal traditions of \nBosnia and Herzegovina and completed more rapidly. \nAccording to President Jorda, the jurisdiction of the State Court should be \ncircumscribed in order to prevent it from being rapidly overwhelmed by the vast number of \nwar crimes cases yet to be tried in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  He recommended that the State \n \n91  Press release of 26 July 2002, JDH\/P.I.S.\/690-e, containing the full text of the speech. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 33 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \nCourt should handle only the cases referred by the ICTY and certain others which would \nnormally fall within the province of the local courts but whose sensitive nature required that \nthey be tried at the state level.  The State Court could also be made responsible for ensuring \nthat proceedings in local courts respected the most fundamental guarantees of a criminal trial.  \nThe local courts should continue to be involved in prosecuting and trying low-ranking war \ncriminals.  In order to enhance the effectiveness of the Agreement and guarantee the \nimpartiality of the local courts, it might be appropriate to authorise international observers to \noversee the proper conduct of the proceedings before such courts or, as the High \nRepresentative had proposed, to restructure them into a small number of \u201cmulti-ethnic\u201d \nregional courts. \nA three-tier judicial architecture was, in sum, proposed by Jorda.  The first tier, the \nICTY, would handle the major political, military, paramilitary and civilian leaders.  This first \ntier was temporary as it had to disappear once the ICTY\u2019s mission had been accomplished.  \nThe second tier, the State Court, would handle intermediate-level accused who would be \nreferred by the International Tribunal.  The Court was conceived as a national institution \naccorded a limited and provisional international character in order to guarantee its \nimpartiality.  The third tier, the local courts, would handle low-ranking accused tried in \naccordance with the Rome Agreement.  Within this structure, the  ICTY would be responsible \nfor overseeing the proper conduct of the second-tier trials and the State Court the third-tier \ntrials. \nFollowing President Jorda\u2019s address to the Security Council, a statement was issued \non behalf of the President of the Security Council stating: \n \nThe Council recognises, as it has done on other occasions \n(for example in its resolution 1329 (2000) of 30 November \n2000), that the ICTY should concentrate its work on the \nprosecution and trial of the civilian, military and \nparamilitary leaders suspected of being responsible for \nserious violations of international humanitarian law \ncommitted in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since \n1991, rather than on minor actors. \nThe Security Council therefore endorses the report\u2019s \nbroad strategy for the transfer of cases involving \nintermediary and lower-level accused to competent national \njurisdictions as likely to be in practice the best way of \nallowing the ICTY to achieve its current objective of \ncompleting all trial activities at first instance by 2008.92 \n \nThe next extraordinary plenary session of the ICTY judges took place on 30 September 2002, \nduring which Rule 11bis was amended.93  It now reads: \n \nRule 11 bis  \n \n92  Ibid. \n93  Press release of 1 October 2002, JdH\/P.I.S.\/696-e. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 34 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \n \nReferral of the Indictment to Another Court \n \n(A) If an indictment has been confirmed, irrespective of whether \nor not the accused is in the custody of the Tribunal, the President \nmay appoint a Trial Chamber for the purpose of referring a case \nto the authorities of a State: \n(i) in whose territory the crime was committed; or \n(ii) in which the accused was arrested, \nso that those authorities should forthwith refer the case to the \nappropriate court for trial within that State. \n(B) The Trial Chamber may order such referral proprio motu or \nat the request of the Prosecutor, after having given to the \nProsecutor and, where applicable, the accused, the opportunity to \nbe heard. \n(C) In determining whether to refer the case in accordance with \nparagraph (A), the Trial Chamber shall, in accordance with \nSecurity Council Presidential Statement S\/PRST\/2002\/21, \nconsider the gravity of the crimes charged and the level of \nresponsibility of the accused. \n(D) Where an order is issued pursuant to this Rule: \n(i) the accused, if in the custody of the Tribunal, shall be \nhanded over to the authorities of the State concerned; \n(ii) the Chamber may order that protective measures for \ncertain witnesses or victims remain in force; \n(iii) the Prosecutor shall provide to the authorities of the \nState concerned all of the information relating to the case \nwhich the Prosecutor considers appropriate and, in \nparticular, the material supporting the indictment; \n(iv) the Prosecutor may send observers to monitor the \nproceedings in the national courts on her behalf. \n(E) The Trial Chamber may issue a warrant for the arrest of the \naccused, which shall specify the State to which he is to be \ntransferred to trial. \n(F) At any time after an order has been issued pursuant to this \nRule and before the accused is found guilty or acquitted by a \nnational court, the Trial Chamber may, at the request of the \nProsecutor and upon having given to the State authorities \nconcerned the opportunity to be heard, revoke the order and \nmake a formal request for deferral within the terms of Rule 10. \n \nThings then happened fast.

In addition, due to problems remaining in \nBiH, there must be effective support for the \ninvestigation of war crimes and the apprehension of \nsuspects.  \n\u2022 The specialised War Crimes Chamber within the Court \nof BiH will have jurisdiction over three types of war \ncrimes: those cases deferred by ICTY in accordance \nwith Rule 11 bis of the Rules of Procedure and \nEvidence (approximately 15 accused); those cases \ndeferred by the ICTY Prosecutor\u2019s office, for which \nIndictments have not yet been issued (approximately 45 \nsuspects); and those \u201cRules of the Road\u201d cases before \n \n96  Press release of 13 December 2002, JdH\/P.I.S.\/718-e. \n97  Press release of 15 January 2003, OHR\/P.I.S.\/723-3. \n98  Press release of 14 February 2003, CC\/P.I.S.\/727-e. \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 36 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \n                                                \ndomestic courts, which due to their sensitivity should \nbe tried at the State Court level.  \n\u2022 BiH Laws shall apply. The ICTY experience will also \nbe referred to in the development of specific rules of \nprocedure for the specialised War Crimes Chamber of \nthe Court of BiH, and in the review of the Criminal \nProcedure Code of BiH.  \n\u2022 The establishment of the specialised War Crimes \nChamber of the Court of BiH requires the renovation of \nadditional facilities as well as adequate security \nmeasures.  \n\u2022 The creation of state level detention facilities is a pre-\ncondition not only for the work of the future specialised \nWar Crimes Chamber of the Court of BiH, but for the \nwork of its other chambers as well.  \n\u2022 A witness protection programme and a programme to \nprovide security for judges and prosecutors must be \ndeveloped. \n  \nBoth the OHR and the ICTY recognise that an effective \nwar crimes trial capability within BiH is an essential part of \nthe establishment of the rule of law and fundamental to the \nreconciliation process, creating necessary conditions to \nsecure a lasting peace in BiH.99 \n \nThese conclusions were presented to the Peace Implementation Council in Brussels on \n28 March 2003 and are to be put before the Security Council as soon as practicable, although \nat this time, there are more serious problems taking up the Council\u2019s time.100  Bernard Fassier \nbriefed the Steering Board on the OHR-ICTY plan to enable the effective domestic \nprosecution of war crimes cases in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and their evaluation of the costs.  \nThe Steering Board supported the objectives of this plan, agreeing that it was essential that it \nshould be adequately resourced, and clearly define responsibilities for establishing, \nimplementing, and then transferring to Bosnia and Herzegovina, the administration of the \nchamber before it is launched. \n \n* * * * * \n \n\u201cSuch a terrible complexity has been left by the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which \nsome desire to restore; such a complexity, in which nobody can be right and nobody can be \nwrong, and the future cannot be fortunate.\u201d101  Thus Rebecca West, when talking about \nCroatia in her report on the Yugoslavia of the 1930s, described the immense problems of \n \n99  Press release of 21 February 2003, OHR\/P.I.S.\/731-e. \n100  See press statement of 30 March 2003 at <www.ohr.int\/pic\/default.asp?content_id=29583> (last \naccessed on 8 April 2003). \n101  REBECCA WEST, BLACK LAMB AND GREY FALCON, A JOURNEY THROUGH YUGOSLAVIA 112 (2001). \nLast Exit Bosnia\/Bohlander  Page 37 \nCriminal Law Forum, Vol. XIV, No. 1 \n8\/22\/08 \n \n \n \nbringing harmony to the differing interests of and movements within the ethnic factions.  The \nsame problems appear to persist today in Bosnia.  The international community, and \nespecially the United Nations, intends to take another step towards achieving that elusive \nharmony by allowing the citizens of that country to come to terms with their past in their own \nway.  Whether the citizens, and more precisely, the judges, prosecutors, counsel and \npolicemen, and above all the local politicians of Bosnia are ready for this endeavour is open \nto question.  In part the world community does so because of political and financial \nconstraints on the operation of the ICTY, whose initial mission and subsequent procedural \nframework were never meant to allow the trial of dozens of minor to mid-level war criminals, \nand in part it will have to do its utmost in order to restore credibility to the international \ndiplomatic forum and to exorcise the ghosts of Austria-Hungary which Rebecca West wrote \nabout \u2013 there is a lot to be done.  Those ghosts are now more a thing of the past to us than \nthey were in Rebecca West\u2019s times, but the world is never short of new ones, and it would \nappear that the most recent ones have come to life in Iraq.  It is time that the leaders of the \npowerful nations spared the simple people of this planet the creation of terrible complexities \n\u2013 otherwise Rebecca West\u2019s prophecy that the future cannot be fortunate will not only be true \nfor the Balkans, but for all of us. \n \n***Postal address of author***Landgericht Meiningen, Lindenallee 15, 98617 Meiningen, \nGermany \n***Telephone***+49-3693-5090 (switchboard) \n***Fax***+49-36949-40296 \n***e-mail***intcrimlaw@gmx.de \n \n"}
