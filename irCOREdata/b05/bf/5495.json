Socialisation or \u2018knowing one another\u2019 in remote distributed environments\ncan be achieved through synchronous technologies such as instant messaging, audio and\nvideo-conferencing. However, a 3D virtual world can provide an immersive experience\nwhere there is a visual presence and virtual proximity of the group members in terms of\ntheir 3D selves (avatars). We discuss the affordances of a 3D virtual world and its role\nin providing a platform for pedagogical design that engenders socialisation, synchronous\ncommunication and collaboration. We propose the use of a knowledge construction\nmodel as a framework for guiding the design of collaborative activities in a 3D virtual\nworld for blended learning environments. We believe that this framework will also be\nuseful for integrating 2D environments such as blogs, wikis and forums with a 3D\nlearning environment. We consider the implications of this in the context of blended\nlearning in distance education. This paper would be of interest to course designers,\nresearchers, teachers, staff developers and policy-makers who are involved in integrating\n3D virtual worlds within the curriculum of their programmes and institutions.\nKeywords: 3D virtual worlds; online learning; socialisation; collaboration; synthetic\nworlds\nIntroduction\nThere are many schools of thought on learning, including behaviourism, cognitive psychol-\nogy and constructivism, and no one theory is used exclusively for the design of networked\nlearning environments. Course designers tend to include principles from all three (Anderson\nand Elloumi 2004). As research progresses, new learning theories to support the development\nof online materials are evolving. Over the last two decades, social theories of learning have\nassumed prominence in debate amongst researchers (e.g. Lave and Wenger 1991; Mayes\n2001). Although the views of various social theorists differ (Salomon and Perkins 1998),\nthere is a general consensus that interaction, dialogue and collaboration are essential for\nproductive learning. Technology can provide a medium for conversing and collaborating\nwithin the learning environment (Jonassen, Peck, and Wilson 1999). The growing interest\nin social dimensions of learning has led to institutions adopting Virtual Learning Environ-\nments (VLEs) which have collaboration and communication tools such as wikis, blogs,\nforums and chat.\n*Corresponding author: Email: s.minocha@open.ac.uk\n182  S. Minocha and D. Roberts\nTo integrate the social dimension in the pedagogy of online learning environments, Felix\n(2005) has proposed the synthesis of the cognitive and social constructivist approaches. In\nthe cognitive constructivist approach, the focus is on the individual in the group, believing\nthat cognition occurs in the head of the individual and that learners make intellectual sense\nof the materials on their own. The social constructivist approach emphasises the socially and\nculturally situated context of cognition, in which knowledge is constructed in shared\nendeavours (Duffy and Cunningham 1996). The interactions in the online environment, for\nexample, through collaborations or discussions over forums, or in wikis, or on mailing lists,\nenable the knowledge to be constructed individually but mediated socially. The experiences\nof social interaction can be facilitated through interactive activities such as small group\ndiscussions, simulation games, project-based work, and collaborative problem-solving\nactivities (Mason and Romiszowski 1996).\nSocialisation\nOne important aspect of successful online experiences, student socialisation, appears to\nhave a fractured research history and has been somewhat overlooked (Irwin and Berge\n2006). However, research in online learning environments has shown that socialisation is,\nin fact, a central element in the student\u2019s experiences in collaborative activities. Salmon\n(2000) has developed a five-stage model for e-moderators. In the first stage the moderator\naddresses any technical or social issues that inhibit participation. In the second stage the\nmoderator develops online socialisation by \u201cbuilding bridges between cultural, social and\nlearning environments\u201d (2000, 26). These early stages open the way for collaboration and\nknowledge construction (stages 3\u20135). Wilson (2001) has described that participants in\nonline communities should have a shared sense of belonging, trust, expectation of learning,\nand commitment to participate and to contribute to the community.\nFor educators and students it is often difficult to assess one another\u2019s pre-dispositions in\nan online learning context and especially in the critical, early stages of the collaboration.\nHence some course designers specifically give an opportunity at the start of students\u2019 learning\ninteractions to share their understandings and particular aspects of themselves (Wegerif\n1998). This sharing can be done formally, through questionnaires, but is often accomplished\nmore effectively by ice-breaking activities. However, as we discuss below, studies have\nshown that: \n\u25cf early socialisation in online learning environments may not be adequate to sustain the\ncollaboration and co-operation (e.g. Minocha and Roberts 2008);\n\u25cf the methods of socialisation such as general introductions and ice-breakers may not\nbe sufficient for development of shared understanding amongst the learners (e.g.\nIrwin and Berge 2006); and\n\u25cf socialisation may need to be integrated throughout the collaboration for development\nand sustenance of a learning community (e.g. Nicol, Minty, and Sinclair 2003).\nIn this paper, we first discuss the significance of socialisation in technology-enabled learn-\ning and the elements which constitute socialisation. We then discuss empirical evidence\nrelated to students\u2019 perceived lack of socialisation when collaborating in 2D environments\nsuch as blogs, wikis and forums. Next, the characteristics of a 3D virtual world are outlined\nand we discuss its role in providing a platform for pedagogical design that engenders social-\nisation, synchronous communication and collaboration. We propose the use of a knowledge\nconstruction model as a framework for guiding the design of collaborative activities in a 3D\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   183\nvirtual world and for integrating 2D environments such as blogs, wikis and forums in\nconjunction with a 3D learning environment.\nSocialisation in technology-enabled learning\nSocialisation is of particular interest to psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists.\nThere are diverse opinions about its definition, the best methods for achieving it and effects\nit has on other outcomes. For the purposes of this paper, as applicable for technology-\nenabled distance education, socialisation encompasses the social act of coming together for\na common purpose, for example, when students familiarise themselves with one other and\nlearn about the norms, roles, rules and code of conduct. This initial phase of familiarisation\nis achieved through interacting with one another and sharing ideas and information. As a\nresult of this shared experience, participants are able to become aware of one another, relate\nto one another (Wegerif 1998) and establish a connection. Socialisation, as a stage in devel-\noping collaborative learning in online environments, has been investigated in asynchronous\n2D environments such as in discussion forums (e.g. Salmon 2004; Motteram 2001).\nSocialisation is a complex and dynamic aspect of education. Researchers in education,\ncommunication and media studies have discussed aspects that constitute socialisation. Irwin\nand Berge (2006) identified three elements of socialisation: interaction, presence, and\nknowledge construction. We will take each of these elements in turn to present the previous\nresearch in this area.\nInteraction\nBerge (1999) suggests that interaction is important to learner satisfaction and that it assists\nin maintaining student persistence in courses. There should be interaction between the\nlearner and other learners, between the learner and the educator, and between the learner and\nexperts. This allows them to collaborate, participate in shared cognition, form social\nnetworks, and establish social presence (Anderson and Elloumi 2004). The degree of\ninteraction must be balanced to maintain student motivation. Too much interaction may be\nperceived as unhelpful and an overload, while too little interaction may result in student\nisolation (Berge 1999). Given that groups of students do not just become collaborative\nbecause they are assigned together (Johnson and Johnson 1996) and as dialogue is at the\ncentre of teaching and learning (Laurillard 2002; Moore 1993), the online educator\u2019s most\nimportant responsibility is to ensure \u201ca high degree of interactivity and participation\u201d\n(Kearsley 2000, 78). One interesting view is that online interaction should seek to mimic a\nplace-based meeting, to allow students the comfort of retaining face-to-face (FTF) conven-\ntions (Northrup 2002). Interaction is critical to create a sense of presence and a sense of\ncommunity for online learners, and to promote collaborative learning (Murphy and\nCifuentes 2001). The value of interaction lies in its contribution to the participant\u2019s ability\nto establish a sense of being in the virtual environment, that is, social presence.\nSocial presence\nSocial presence is defined as the degree of awareness of another person in an interaction and\nthe consequent appreciation of an interpersonal relationship (Short, Williams, and Christie\n1976; Rice 1993). Short, Williams, and Christie (1976) regarded social presence as the most\nimportant perception that occurs in an environment and stated that it is fundamental to\nperson-to-person communication. Factors that contribute to the degree of social presence in\n184  S. Minocha and D. Roberts\na face-to-face encounter are facial expressions, direction of gaze, posture, dress, non-verbal\ncues, and vocal cues. In the absence of traditional communication cues in the electronic\nclassroom, social presence is a measure of the feeling of community that a learner experi-\nences in an online environment (Tu and McIssac 2002). Social presence, according to Shin\n(2002), is when students are \u201cfeeling intimacy or togetherness in terms of sharing time and\nplace\u201d. Such a feeling of being connected to one another and reducing social distances is\nimportant when students are separated by geography (Brown and Duguid 2002) and directly\naffects the quality of interactions (Shin 2002, 126). There are a number of factors that\ninfluence social presence.\nPrivacy affects the degree of social presence. A less private setting results in a decreased\nperception of social presence by students. Champness (1972) reported that users felt more\npublic in a video conference and perceived less social presence. Perse et al. (1992) found a\npositive relationship between social presence and a student\u2019s perception of their computer\nexpertise. Social presence influences interaction and vice versa.\nRelationship between interaction and social presence\nInteraction includes the activities in which participants in a Computer-Mediated Communi-\ncation (CMC) engage and the communication styles they use. Immediacy is a component of\ninteractivity and is the psychological distance between a communicator and a recipient of\nthe communication. In asynchronous CMC, responses are delayed and a feeling of low\nimmediacy and less awareness of interactivity can diminish social presence. Nicol, Minty,\nand Sinclair (2003) reported that students\u2019 experiences with asynchronous discussions were\nnot positive because of time lag, passive participation (\u2018lurking\u2019), and absence of defined\nprocedures or norms for contributions.\nTu and McIssac (2002) investigated the relationship between social presence and inter-\naction in online environments. Tu and McIssac found several factors that influenced social\npresence in CMC: early familiarisation with recipients; timely response; developing trust\n(which requires more time in CMC); task types such as decision-making, creativity and social\ntasks, and perception of privacy. They found that social presence positively influenced online\ninteraction. However, frequency of participation did not represent high social presence.\nKnowledge construction\nSocial presence and interaction foster socialisation. Socialisation is the pre-requisite for\neffective collaboration and socialisation is also the outcome of collaboration, and hence, is\npervasive throughout the collaboration. Knowledge construction is achieved by the interac-\ntion that takes place within oneself through reflective thinking and by the interaction that\noccurs in communications and collaboration with other people (Vygotsky 1978). The active\nexchange of ideas, dialogue and negotiation of views by looking at and reflecting on the\nmultiple perspectives of fellow students facilitate collaborative and co-operative learning in\nwhich students and educators become active participants in the learning process.\nIn the next section, we discuss empirical evidence on the students\u2019 perceived lack of\nsocialisation when collaborating in 2D environments.\nPerceived lack of socialisation in 2D environments\nRecent empirical research on the pedagogical role and effectiveness in the context of wikis\n(Minocha and Thomas 2007) and blogs (Kerawalla et al. 2008; Minocha and Roberts\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   185\n2008) in distance education has shown that inadequate socialisation at the start of the\ncollaborative activity was a key obstacle in conducting group projects or activities at a\ndistance.\nIn the post-graduate computing course (Minocha and Thomas 2008) which had a wiki-\nbased group project, the students do not meet face-to-face. It was only through online social-\nisation activities that the students got to know one another. Whilst there was an ice-breaker\ninvolving introducing one another in the wiki at the start of the group project, it was\nperceived to be inadequate by the students and several students commented on the difficulty\nof working with a group of relative strangers. One student stated: \nWhere project teams already know and understand each other, electronic communication is\nfine. Where strangers do not, all non-verbal communication is lost, leading to misunderstanding\nand potential conflict.\nIn a year-long research project (2006\u20132007) which investigated the role of blogs in learn-\ning and teaching, Kerawalla et al. (in press) examined two online courses. These are\nreferred to as course \u2018A\u2019 and course \u2018B\u2019 in this paper. On course \u2018A\u2019, the usage of blogs\nwas non-prescriptive and the course guide stated: \u201cYou will be encouraged to use\npersonal blog (web log) as a learning journal to record and reflect upon your course\nactivities, professional practices and development needs as you progress through the\ncourse\u201d. On this course, one of the student groups (18 students out of the 108 students\nregistered on the course) was encouraged by their tutor to post photographs or anything\npersonal such as poems, details of a recent holiday, and so on. Most students posted\nphotographs of themselves, or of their family, or of family pets on the first few blog\nposts.\nWhen the researchers asked the students in interviews about the benefits of posting\nthese pictures and other personal artefacts, the students felt that exchanging personal arte-\nfacts was a good way to introduce themselves to the group with whom they would be\ncollaborating. Comments on these early blog posts resulted in conversations, and a small\ngroup of students built up a support network through blogging to reach out to each other\nfor both academic and social support (Minocha and Roberts 2008). Their posts were writ-\nten in an informal, friendly style, and often addressed the reader directly. These posts\ncontained high-quality academic work that was peppered with details of the students\u2019\npersonal life, photographs of their children, pictures to convey their moods or emotions,\nand also humour.\nThe socialisation via their blogs early in the course and sharing of personal thoughts and\nimages throughout the course helped this small group of students to effectively collaborate\nand learn from one another. However, the majority of students on this course (those who\nwere not encouraged to blog about personal aspects early on in the course) had concerns\nabout blogging and stopped blogging after a few days into the course. Various social,\npedagogical and technological factors influenced their perceptions about blogging\n(Minocha and Roberts 2008). Some of the students were anxious and self-conscious about\nblogging. They felt that their own inexperience as learners and users of technology, and\ntheir lack of confidence and potential incompetence, would be revealed to others in the\npublic blogging space. The blogs had been administered by the university, and hence\nstudents were unable to make the blogs private or limit access to selected fellow students.\nThe socialisation and community aspects of blogs hadn\u2019t been detailed in the guidance\ngiven to the students. One student could not see the purpose of the blog and how it fitted\nwithin the course. \n186  S. Minocha and D. Roberts\nI couldn\u2019t actually see what use it would have or how I would use it. I couldn\u2019t picture it as a\nmajor part of the course at all.\nOn the online course B, early in the course the students were given a (compulsory) activity\nof posting the summaries of case studies and commenting on one another\u2019s blog posts. This\nactivity was linked to the first assignment of the course. There was no formal or informal\nsocialisation activity prescribed by the course or suggested by individual tutors. It was\nfound that most students didn\u2019t blog at all after the first compulsory activity and some of\nthem blogged mainly for themselves. The students on course B said that they had no choice\nother than to blog for themselves as the case-study activity had failed to stimulate any\ncourse blogging community (Kerawalla et al. in press).\nThus, even when tools such as blogs and wikis can facilitate socialisation, there is a need\nfor educators to provide guidance on the role of the tool in socialisation and community-\nbuilding. Further, educators should integrate socialisation in the design of learning activities\nthat encourage independent study which online learners prefer, and yet engender social\npresence, interactions and community-building through collaborative activities.\nThis recent empirical research on blogs and wikis, referred to in the papers mentioned\nhere, uncovered drawbacks of lack of socialisation: inadequate peer review; hesitation to\nreview critically or comment on each other\u2019s contributions; difficulties in negotiating tasks;\nand difficulty in scheduling the sub-tasks in the collaborative activity. Similarly, Nicol,\nMinty, and Sinclair (2003) found that students withheld their input in online exchanges\nbecause \u201cthey were uneasy about the impoverished social nature of online discussions\u201d\n(274). However, even when wikis, forums and blogs can support socialisation, their\nasynchronous nature can affect students\u2019 perceptions of social presence and effectiveness of\ncollaboration.\nNeed for synchronous communication in collaborative projects\nEhrlich and Chang (2006) have stated that co-ordination of work in distributed teams is\naccomplished through spontaneous informal communication. They also state that an\nimportant precursor to informal communication is awareness of other team members:\nawareness of what they are doing, and when they would be available for some aspect of the\ncollaborative work. For ongoing collaboration in the wiki-based collaborative activity on\nthe computing course discussed earlier (also see Minocha and Thomas 2007), over half of\nthe students mentioned the need to engage in some form of synchronous communication for\ndiscussion and debate ranging from face-to-face sessions to telephone conferencing. One\nstudent said: \nIt is slow as a communication medium \u2026 A wiki is not a flexible discussion medium.\nI do not believe that a Wiki can be used in isolation when collaborative working, rather it\nshould be adopted alongside other more traditional methods .e.g. telephone conferencing and\nface-to-face meetings \u2026 face to face meetings should take place at various points in the\nrequirements process in order to ensure that the process is managed correctly and difficult\nissues reviewed.\nThe students said that although the wiki had its strengths in recording decisions and support-\ning collaborative authoring, the wiki needed to be supported with a medium for synchronous\ndiscussion to facilitate timely decision-making. Indeed, face-to-face communication or\nother modes of synchronous communication can promote relationship-building (e.g. Peters\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   187\nand Manz 2007) and can generally help expedite negotiations and decision-making in\ncollaborative activities. Face-to-face meetings are generally not feasible in distance-\neducation courses. In fact, face-to-face meetings may sometimes interfere with the develop-\nment of online communication skills (Salmon 2000) and, as we have seen, in online\nenvironments students\u2019 perceptions of privacy have an impact on social presence and they\nmay not prefer face-to-face interactions. Further, the students on the two blogging courses\nand the wiki-based course discussed here were from around the world (including the UK,\nthe USA and China) and, thus, it would not have been feasible to bring them together in a\nface-to-face setting.\nAgainst this backdrop, we now discuss the role of 3D virtual environments such as\nSecond Life in providing a real-life setting or \u2018place\u2019 for socialisation and its sustenance,\ncollaboration and synchronous communication.\n3D immersive virtual worlds\n3D virtual worlds are multimedia immersive,1 simulated environments, often managed over\nthe Web, which users can \u2018inhabit\u2019. They can interact via their own graphical, humanoid,\nself-representations known as \u2018avatars\u2019. Therefore, a virtual world is a cyberspace which\nhas simulated bodies in simulated places. Castronova (2005, 11) prefers to use the term\n\u2018synthetic world\u2019 which he defines as an expansive, world-like, large-group environment\nmade by humans, for humans, and which is maintained, recorded and rendered by a\ncomputer.\n3D virtual worlds are being used in many applications: education\/training, gaming, social\nnetworking, marketing, and commerce. Some examples are: There.com and Active-\nworlds.com for social networking; World of Warcraft is a Massively Multi-player Online\nRole-playing Game (MMORPG); and Second Life, primarily for education and business. 3D\nvirtual worlds dedicated to specific business domains are also being developed. For example,\nForterra Systems have developed a virtual world called OLIVE (On-Line Interactive Virtual\nEnvironment). OLIVE enables customers to create virtual worlds primarily for training and\nsimulations in healthcare, the military, and the media (Kushner 2008).\nUnlike MMORPGs which have a scripted plot or storyline for the role-playing and\ngame(s), Second Life, the 3D virtual world which we considered in this paper, is not a\n\u2018game\u2019 per se. It has a very strong user community, and the content and narrative is\nconstructed and owned by the residents. In the following sections, we will discuss the role\nof 3D virtual worlds in socialisation and knowledge construction in online education by\ngiving examples of Second Life because it the most widely used virtual world in education.\n3D virtual worlds as learning environments\nThe challenge for educators and course designers creating online education is to construct\na learning environment that is simultaneously learning-centred, content-centred, commu-\nnity-centred, and assessment-centred (Bransford, Brown, and Cocking 1999). Similar to the\n2D Web (Anderson and Elloumi 2004), the communication and collaboration characteris-\ntics of 3D virtual worlds facilitate the development of a learning environment which can\nsupport \u2018how people learn\u2019 (Bransford, Brown, and Cocking 1999): \n\u25cf a 3D virtual world supports individualised and group activities through asynchronous\nand synchronous interactions in many formats (text chat, instant messaging, e-mail,\nvoice chat, gestures);\n188  S. Minocha and D. Roberts\n\u25cf it is knowledge-centred as the students can have direct access to vast libraries of\ncontent and learning activities in-world (within the 3D environment); and\n\u25cf there are opportunities for formative and summative assessment by self, peers, and\neducators.\nHowever, 3D virtual worlds, unlike the 2D Web, can offer immersion, realism and interac-\ntion through multimedia communication along with realistic, animated and customised\navatars.\nHuman social environment of virtual worlds: real-time interaction and social presence\nUsing, audio, text and gestures the users, via their avatars, can converse in real time.\nCastronova (2005) says: \u201cThe physical environment is entirely crafted [in the synthetic\nworld] and can be anything we want it to be, but the human social environment that emerges\nfrom that physical environment is no different from any other human social environment\u201d.\nTherefore, a 3D virtual world provides a social setting similar to a face-to-face setting where\nthe relationships are being mediated by bodies (avatars) which are one step removed from\nthe Earthly body, and therefore occur in a place that is one step removed from the Earth\n(Castronova 2005, 7).\nBecause of this, a 3D virtual world offers a sense of social presence via the avatars\nwhich may facilitate socialisation, an antecedent for effective operation of a virtual team in\nan educational context. This sense of presence and sense of place in a 3D world can make\nlearning, and indeed socialising, in a virtual world a more \u2018human\u2019 experience than many\nother 2D environments. Further, a 3D virtual world enables creation of learning environ-\nments to enhance experiential learning, allowing individuals to practice skills, understand\ncourse concepts via 3D simulations and experiment with them, collaborate through role-\nplaying activities and have real-world-like experiences (e.g. Kamel Boulos, Hetherington,\nand Wheeler 2007). The lack of a guiding narrative in some virtual worlds such as Second\nLife provides flexibility to the educators and course designers to define an experience which\nmatches the needs of the course. They can then design the learning space for that pedagogy\nrather than the other way around, which they may be forced to in some off-the-shelf VLEs.\nAn \u2018island\u2019 in Second Life can provide a dedicated environment for learning which helps to\nensure a sense of belonging and purpose for the students.\nAvatar-based communication\n3D virtual worlds facilitate communications which are different from chat, instant messag-\ning, blogs, wiki, and the like. None of these tools invoke the Earth and a body as metaphors\nfor interaction. 3D worlds allow people to experience human social life in an environment\nin which people interact with a body (avatar) they desire or choose. This feature of synthetic\nworlds removes from the social calculus all the unfortunate effects or any inhibitions that\nderive from the physical body (Castronova 2005).\nAvatar-based communication is better than competing technologies such as instant\nmessaging, blogs, wikis, forums, and so on at facilitating the interactions that humans want\nto have. 3D worlds provide a form of word-communication (through text and voice) and\nalso enable a kind of bodily communication, through the gestures and position of the avatar.\nThus they may offer a higher-quality forum of interaction than the chat room or the\ntelephone, neither of which gives scope of the body. And while video conferencing gives\nboth body and voice, it does not do so in a way that allows people to mingle with one\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   189\nanother in a world-like space. Video conferencing can be very expensive in bandwidth.\nAvatar-based voice conferencing can provide a close substitute that costs much less. Thus,\nrelative to these other communication tools, virtual worlds seem very competitive on the\ngrounds of either better service or lower cost or both.\n3D virtual worlds should enable educators and learners to be more creative and to\ndevelop new effective ways of teaching and learning, rather than to purely replicate real-life\nclassrooms in 3D virtual worlds. It is important to identify and focus on what 3D virtual\nworlds are most useful for: those activities that can only be effectively carried out in virtual\nworlds and not just as effectively in any other electronic medium. We must also determine\nand disseminate the optimal combination for blended approaches that combine 2D and 3D\nlearning environments.\nFramework for design of Second Life activities\nIn this section, we propose the application of a knowledge construction model as a frame-\nwork for guiding the design of collaborative activities in a 3D virtual world and for integrat-\ning 2D environments such as blogs, wikis and forums in conjunction with a 3D learning\nenvironment.\nKnowledge creation model: Socialisation, Externalisation, Combination and \nInternalisation (SECI)\nNonaka and Takeuchi (1995) proposed a model for knowledge creation: the SECI model\ninvolves conversion between explicit and tacit knowledge. The notions of explicit and tacit\nknowledge were introduced by Polanyi (1958) and used by Nonaka (1991) to formulate a\ntheory of learning in an organisation that focuses on the conversion of knowledge between\ntacit and explicit forms. Explicit knowledge is represented by some artefact such as data, a\ndocument, a video, or a podcast, which has been created for communicating to another\nperson and can be processed, stored and transmitted. In contrast, tacit knowledge is what the\nperson possessing that knowledge \u2018knows\u2019, it is derived from experience and hard to\nformalise. Tacit knowledge is deeply rooted in action, procedures, routines, commitment,\nideals, values and emotions. Knowledge is created through interactions between tacit and\nexplicit knowledge, rather than from tacit or explicit knowledge alone (Nonaka, Toyama,\nand Konno 2000). Additionally, knowledge is created thorough interactions amongst\nindividuals or between individuals and their environment. Through these interactions, tacit\nand explicit knowledge expands in both quality and quantity.\nThe SECI model encompasses the four modes of knowledge conversion and creation\n(Figure 1). \n\u25cf Socialisation includes shared formation and communication of tacit knowledge\nbetween people through shared experiences. Socialisation may occur in apprentice-\nship or in informal social meetings where tacit knowledge such as world views and\nmental models can be exchanged and mutual trust and shared views can be created\nand shared.\n\u25cf Externalisation is the process of articulating tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge.\nWhen tacit knowledge is made explicit, knowledge is crystallised, thus allowing it to\nbe shared with others, and it becomes the basis of new knowledge. This process may\ninvolve performing activities which use metaphors, analogues, models, and the like,\nand result in creation of concepts.\n190  S. Minocha and D. Roberts\n\u25cf Combination is a process of converting explicit knowledge into more complex sets of\nexplicit knowledge. Explicit knowledge is collected from various sources within the\ngroup and from documents and websites outside the group to form new knowledge.\nThis new knowledge is then disseminated among the members of the group in the\nform of a report.\n\u25cf Internalisation is the process of embodying explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge.\nBy reading documents and reflecting upon them, the explicit knowledge is interna-\nlised to enrich the tacit knowledge base. Explicit knowledge can also be embodied\nthrough simulations, or experiments that trigger learning by doing. This tacit knowl-\nedge accumulated at an individual level can then set off a new spiral of knowledge\ncreation when it is shared with others through socialisation.\nFigure 1. The knowledge creation model.\nApplication of a SECI model: design of activities involving Second life and\n2D environments\nUsing the SECI model, we will present the design of activities related to learning styles and\nskills development on a Level 1 distance education course in a university. This course is\nVLE-based and has a discussion forum, blog and wiki. The students meet their tutor in a\nface-to-face tutorial every other month. The motivation for introducing Second Life activi-\nties in this course has been inadequate participation of the students in the forums and poor\nattendance at the tutorials. The goal is to enhance the students\u2019 interactions and engagement\nwith fellow students, their tutor and the university.\nFor the process of socialisation, the following activities will be performed by\nstudents: \n\u25cf introduce themselves via their real names and not avatar names as these students work\ntogether in forums and other 2D environments on the course where real names are used;\n\u25cf discuss the experiences on the course so far \u2013 one good and one bad aspect; and\n\u25cf explore different parts of the university\u2019s Second Life island, guided via the teleport\n(location) map, and report back on one aspect of the island that really caught their\nattention. In the exploration of the island, the students could be specifically asked to\nSocialisation (S) \nTacit to Tacit \nEmpathising \nSharing mental models\nExternalisation (E) \nTacit  to Explicit \nArticulating \nDialogue\nInternalisation (I) \nExplicit to Tacit \nEmbodying \nReflection \nCombination (C) \nExplicit to Explicit \nConnecting \nSynthesising\nFigure 1. The knowledge creation model.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   191\nhunt for objects in pairs on the island and report their location to the facilitator and\nthe group.\nIn the second stage of the SECI model, the activity should involve discussion and articula-\ntion of knowledge. The students and the tutor (facilitator) will meet in Second Life for the\nactivity. The facilitator will introduce the activity and various learning styles to the students.\nBased on the student\u2019s individual perceived learning style, the students will be asked to\nposition themselves (their avatars) near a chart with displays of various styles. Students will\nthen be encouraged to discuss at least one learning strategy that they use for their learning\nstyle. Next, they will be given a note card2 with characteristics of the learning styles based\non theory (e.g., see http:\/\/www.chaminade.org\/inspire\/learnstl.htm). The students will be\nasked to discuss the learning styles in pairs and check whether there is any mismatch in their\nperceived learning style (what they thought) and the learning style that they actually have\n(based on characteristics derived from theory). The students will then come back together\nand position their avatars against the chart again. Then they will gather around as a group\nto report any mismatches to the group. This activity in Second Life will help to further\nsocialisation and also to convert tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge.\nAfter the activity in Second Life, students could discuss and record their perceptions and\nunderstanding of learning styles, and experiences of the collaborative activity in a 2D\nenvironment such as a wiki or a group-blog or a discussion forum (the process of combina-\ntion of the SECI model).\nInternalisation, the fourth process, involves reflection, for example by reading wiki or\nblog content, or writing about experiences as a part of the course work. Students could\nreflect on the collaborative activity and the collaboration process and record their reflections\nin their course work which will help internalise the knowledge of learning styles and the\nroles of learning styles in skills development. These reflections will facilitate learning and\nalso provide useful feedback to the course designers about students\u2019 understanding of the\ntask and their experiences and the effectiveness of the collaborative process.\nThe SECI model and the various tools involved in the sample activity are shown in\nFigure 2.\nFigure 2. Blended learning in a distance-education course involving 3D virtual worlds and 2D tools.Some generic observations from the usage of the model in the design of this sample\nactivity are: socialisation is integrated at every stage of the collaborative activity; and the\nSECI model can help guide the design of activities where usage of 3D virtual worlds can be\ncombined with other 2D tools in the knowledge construction process.\nDiscussion\nSocialisation is a key element of online learning and knowledge construction. Virtual ice-\nbreakers early on in collaboration may not be sufficient to develop and maintain shared under-\nstanding, mutual trust and social presence. Socialisation needs to be integrated and sustained\nin the collaboration process through the design of activities which are sure to reduce social\ndistance amongst online learners. The various factors that influence socialisation are:\ninteraction, synchronous communication, face-to-face-like social environment for commu-\nnication and collaboration, and ensuring privacy of the learners.\nBlending of 2D learning environments and media with 3D virtual worlds\n3D virtual worlds like Second Life have the potential for providing a platform for learning,\nsocialisation and knowledge creation \u2013 especially through providing social presence,\n192  S. Minocha and D. Roberts\nsynchronous communication, privacy and interactions in a 3D environment via user-\ngenerated avatars.\nFor effective knowledge construction, a 3D virtual world provides a space for collabo-\nration. Extensive usage of a synchronous learning environment may be considered as an\noverload for students \u2013 especially those who are involved in part-time and\/or distance\neducation. Also, the students may require time for personal reflection. In conjunction with\nSecond Life, the students will benefit from the provision of other tools such as a blog for\nreflection and note-taking, a wiki for collaborative authoring of an artefact, or a forum for\nasynchronous discussion.\nThe affordances of 2D Web and 3D virtual worlds are different but not mutually exclu-\nsive or a substitute for one another, but rather very complementary and synergistic. The\nchallenges for educators are in designing activities that are situated within the pedagogical\ncontext of the course, meet students\u2019 needs of time and distance constraints, seamlessly\nintegrate 2D Web and 3D worlds, deliver a positive student experience and, most impor-\ntantly, meet the expected learning outcomes. Through some sample activities, we have\nshown the application of the SECI framework for the design of the activities involving 3D\nvirtual worlds and 2D tools in the socialisation and knowledge construction processes.\nOther synchronous technologies that are available in the educator\u2019s toolbox are audio or\nweb conferencing tools such as Lyceum (http:\/\/lyceum.open.ac.uk) and Elluminate (http:\/\/\nwww.elluminate.com\/) for real-time interaction and early socialisation in a course.\nHowever, the avatar-based real-time interactions in a 3D world provide a social setting\nalmost equivalent to face-to-face. In addition, avatars can provide anonymity and privacy\non aspects such as the physical appearance of the real person behind the avatar.\nExpressing emotions in avatar-based communication and collaboration\nIn face-to-face conversations, our expressions signal our thoughts and feelings. A gaze\nindicates attention; narrowed lips reveal anger. The expressions are reliable means of\nSocialisation (S) \nTacit to Tacit \nIce-breakers in Second Life \nExternalisation (E) \nTacit to Explicit \nCourse activity in Second Life \nAnswering questions\nInternalisation (I) \nExplicit to Tacit \nReflection: reading the blog \nand wiki content;\nGroup-reflection in Second \nLife sessions \nCombination (C) \nExplicit to Explicit \nDiscussion and connection of \nideas in: blogs; group-blogs;\nwikis; podcasts; vodcasts;\nand Forums \nFigure 2. Blended learning in a distance-education course involving 3D virtual worlds and 2D tools.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   193\ncommunication, but we can also edit and control them. We feign attentiveness when bored\nand maintain a poker face during intense negotiations. Expressions that do not match our\nunderlying feelings are essential not only for deception (Galanxhi and Nah 2007) but also\nfor privacy and social graciousness.\nEven though a 3D virtual world may provide a face-to-face environment, the expressive-\nness of current avatars is limited (Meadows 2008). The avatars can be moved next to each\nother to talk but often stare blankly into space, inert and unengaged. In current 3D worlds\nsuch as Second Life there is only a minimal set of user commands for expressing emotion,\nentered via the keyboard or selected from a menu. This minimal set of user interface\ncontrols and their lack of transparency (the controls can be difficult to interpret and interact\nwith), has a potential to convey \u2018false\u2019 behaviour or \u2018no response\u2019 which may be unin-\ntended. Further, users may intentionally deceive by not conveying their actual emotional\nstate (for example, giving a constant smile even when one is feeling very unhappy). Such\nfalse behaviours, intended or accidental, may affect aspects such as the interactions between\nthe avatars in-world, the perceptions and reactions of the users on these interactions, and on\nthe quality of the socialisation process.\nFurther, during a lecture in a face-to-face setting, it is common for educators to judge\nthrough visual cues about a student\u2019s presence in the class, their attentiveness, and whether\nthey seem to understand what is being taught in the class. This enables the educator to\nchange their teaching strategies to suit the situation. It is not possible for an educator to get\nthese social and visual cues in an avatar-based communication and respond accordingly.\nAn important focus of research is, therefore, how to make avatars more expressive \u2013 able\nto make appropriate eye contact, smile, accurately show interest or boredom and so on\n(Donath 2008). Also, in the not-too-distant future, users will be able to choose the veracity\nof the avatars depending on the needs in each interaction, much as we now choose the\ncommunication media \u2013 video conference, phone, IM, e-mail \u2013 according to the nature of\nthe message. Further, researchers predict that soon systems will allow the users the same\nrevelatory and inhibitory control over the avatar\u2019s expressiveness that they have over their\nown (Donath 2008; Meadows 2008), thereby improving interactions in-world.\nWay forward\nResearch is still needed to make 3D virtual worlds more accessible and usable. For effective\ndesign and conduct of activities in virtual worlds, learners, educators, and developers need\nto acquire and master new sets of competencies and skills in order for them to make the\nmost efficient and effective use of 3D virtual worlds in learning and teaching.\nAlthough in this paper we have demonstrated the application of the SECI framework,\nthe next steps would be to introduce the framework to the community interested in adopting\n3D virtual worlds in education along with 2D VLE tools. Systematic use and evaluation of\nthe framework in our own institution and other institutions will help ascertain: (1) the\nbenefits of the SECI framework in the design of activities on courses involving 2D and 3D\nenvironments; and (2) the role of 3D virtual worlds such as Second Life in socialisation.\nIn this paper, we have made an attempt to establish the link between socialisation, 3D\nvirtual worlds and the pedagogical theories such as cognitive and social constructivism.\nHowever, the pedagogical underpinnings of socialisation and 3D virtual worlds need further\ninvestigation, specifically with regards to elements of socialisation such as presence and co-\npresence and affordances of social and virtual proximity of 3D virtual worlds. One possible\nway would be to analyse the phenomenon of socialisation by applying the activity theory\n(for example, Engestr\u00f6m 2001 and Mercer 2000).\n194  S. Minocha and D. Roberts\nThough the emotional aspects of 3D virtual worlds hasn\u2019t been the focus of our inves-\ntigation, as the technology progresses to make avatars more expressive, there is a scope\nfor further research. For example, to determine how easy it is for the sender to express his\nemotions and feelings via an avatar, how easy it is for the receiver to perceive these\nexpressions and cues, and the impact of the avatar\u2019s expressiveness on the socialisation\nand collaborative learning.\nNotes\n1. The term \u2018immersion\u2019 is used to describe the psychological reaction of most users when they\nbegin to use virtual worlds. At first they feel detached from the simulation, but after a very short\nperiod of time begin to experience the virtual world as though it were reality, i.e., they become\n\u2018immersed\u2019 in the experience (Roche 2007).\n2.
