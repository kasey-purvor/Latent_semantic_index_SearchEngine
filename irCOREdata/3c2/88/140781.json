The review shows that there is a\nstrong emphasis on design in the manufacturing knowledge research domain, and that\ndetailed design is the main focus for current research. An analysis is carried out\naccording to publication date and consequently trends are identified. The design focus\nis increasing, and the trends show that the domain is driven by industrial applications.\nThe contribution to fundamental research in areas such as knowledge modelling is\nincreasing. Areas that currently have little work in this domain include conceptual\ndesign and service.\nKeywords: Literature review, manufacturing knowledge, enterprise integration\n1. Introduction\nManufacturing in the 21st Century is a major technological challenge that must be\ntackled on several fronts. Engineering is ever advancing, and products are becoming\nmore highly integrated and complex. The new manufacturing enterprise is knowledge\nintensive and globally distributed. It must collaborate closely with a range of partners\nacross geographical and technological boundaries. The manufacturing enterprise has\nbeen the focus of a significant body of research into the capture, representation,\nsharing and application of knowledge. This paper aims to characterise manufacturing\nknowledge research by identifying, classifying and analysing a targeted selection of\nresearch papers. This analysis seeks to highlight current trends and identify areas for\nfuture research.\nManufacturing is considered from an enterprise perspective (Qiu 2006, Molina & Bell\n1999). The enterprise view encompasses a range of operations within the\nmanufacturing business, including: customer requirements capture, product design,\nmanufacturing engineering, production scheduling and production control. These\nareas must communicate with one another across the enterprise, and each has its own\nparticular knowledge and information requirements. The development of information\nand knowledge models to support these activities represents one research stream. A\nclosely related research area is knowledge management, which provides solutions to\nless specific knowledge and information management challenges such as storing and\nretrieving information, and finding relevant expertise through documents and\npersonnel. Another related area is intelligent systems (also expert systems and\nknowledge based engineering), which provide solutions to specific challenges in the\nmanufacturing domain, such as optimising a component for injection moulding or\nassessing a sheet metal part for manufacturability.\nPage 3 of 29\nManufacturing Enterprise\nEngineering\nDesign\nManufacturing\nEngineering\nProduction\nscheduling\nRequirements\ncapture\nProduction\ncontrol\nKnowledge management \/ knowledge sharing\nM\nanufacturing\nexecution\nProcess models\nR\nequirem\nents\nsystem\nKnowledge and information models\nEnterprise\nlevel\nsupport\nEnterprise\nfunctions\nFunction-\nlevel\nsystems\nSupporting\nstructures\nProcess planning\nsystem\nManufacturability\nanalysis system\nD\nesign\nanalysis\nS\ncheduling\nsystem\nFigure 1: manufacturing knowledge across the enterprise\nFigure 1 provides a high level view of manufacturing knowledge systems, tools and\nsupporting structures. The central section of the figure shows a selection of key\nenterprise functions relating to product development and production. The top section\nshows enterprise level support: knowledge management and knowledge sharing\napplications. Process models also provide support at the enterprise level. Two types of\nfunction-level systems are shown: vertical methods, which target a specific functional\ndomain, and horizontal methods, which support the integration across two or more\ndomains. An example of a horizontal method is a system to create a manufacturing\nprocess plan from a geometric model of a product or component. An example of a\nvertical method is a system to optimise a production schedule based on current\nmachine loading. At the bottom of the figure, knowledge and information models\ncomprise the supporting structures that form the basis of the function level systems.\nAt this level, the syntax and semantics as well as the structure and relationships\nbetween terms are defined. A general objective at this level is to provide structures\nthat support communication across the various enterprise functions. The adoption of\nstandard representations for the various systems at this level supports inter- and intra-\nenterprise communication by ensuring the various partners can understand the content\nand interface with the various systems.\n2. Research method\nThe term \u201cmanufacturing knowledge\u201d is not defined in advance. This review paper\nseeks to develop a description of the domain by finding papers that refer to\n\u2018manufacturing knowledge\u2019, or \u2018manufacturing\u2019 and \u2018knowledge\u2019. The inclusion of\nthe words \u2018manufacturing\u2019 and \u2018knowledge\u2019 within the title, abstract or keywords of\nthe research is sufficient for its inclusion in the study (within the limited search space\nthat is defined in the next section). This review provides researchers in the\nmanufacturing domain with a view of the current status of manufacturing knowledge\nPage 4 of 29\nfrom a technology neutral perspective. This offers a broad scope from which to judge\nthe current contribution of research topics relating to manufacturing knowledge.\nHaving identified the papers, they will be described and categorised. The analysis of\nthese categories will provide a view of the structure and content of the manufacturing\nknowledge domain.\nThe method for identifying research carried out in manufacturing knowledge will be\ndescribed in this section. A number of databases were selected, including INSPEC,\nSCOPUS, ABI\/INFORM (ProQuest), Business source premier (EBSCO) and Science\nCitation Index (ISI). The search phrase \u201cmanufacturing knowledge\u201d was used.\nTotal hits numbered 2921 (January 2007). In the initial search (September 2006)\nScience Citation Index alone showed 2212 hits (2314 in January 2007). The results\nwere filtered to show only those publications from the year 2001 and later. This\nnarrowed the combined results to 130. A number of the references were then rejected\ndue to the format (generally, only refereed journal papers were included), and in some\ncases, the availability of the resource. The resource titles and abstracts were initially\nreviewed to determine appropriate format and content. A more detailed review then\ntook place, to review and categorise the selected papers. A small number of additional\npapers were included in the review, if they described the fundamentals of a particular\ndomain or framework or if they were considered to add weight to a category. These\nwere generally older references that were outside the search parameters. The papers\nthat were included in the final selection were published in the following years: 1997\n(1), 1999 (5), 2000 (1), 2001 (6), 2002 (5), 2003 (5), 2004 (8), 2005 (13), 2006 (30).\n1\n30\n13\n855\n6\n1\n5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\nNumber of\npapers\nFigure 2: publication years of selected papers\nFigure 2 shows a graph of the publication years of the selected papers. Prior to 2001,\nthe papers are not a direct result of the search strategy (these papers were added to\nenhance the description of certain areas). However, beyond 2001 the graph shows a\nclearly increasing trend from 2003 to 2006. It is not clear whether this reflects a\nsignificant increase in publication in this domain, a change in the terminology used\n(such as more frequent use of the term \u2018knowledge\u2019) or an unknown bias towards\nmore recent publications in the search strategy. It appears that there has been a\nPage 5 of 29\nsignificant upward trend in publications in the manufacturing knowledge domain\nsince 2003.\nThe manufacturing knowledge domain is ever advancing, producing research and\nproposing new methods to better manage and integrate the various elements of the\nmanufacturing domain. This is reflected in the recent increase in publications in the\nmanufacturing knowledge domain. The coordination challenge of the manufacturing\nenterprise is considerable. Intelligent systems are widespread in the literature. The\napplication of ontology is growing. Knowledge management is a widespread research\ntopic. There are a variety of methods in the research to model and describe the\nmanufacturing domain, including manufacturing models, product models, design and\nmanufacturing process modelling, product features and manufacturing features.\nThe search method applied produced a relatively homogenous result in terms of the\nacademic specialism behind the research. Virtually all papers are from a\nmanufacturing engineering perspective, with a few notable exceptions. The search\nmethod retrieved very few social or management science perspectives on\nmanufacturing knowledge. Engineering design is often considered as an integral part\nof the manufacturing domain. This is reflected in the subject matter of the papers\nreviewed.\nThe research will initially be described from an applications perspective. Knowledge\nmanagement (including integration, strategy, knowledge mapping, automation and\nrepositories), expert systems (for design analysis, manufacturing analysis), and agent\nbased systems are described. The remaining research is either predominantly focused\non a conceptual element or fits well into that category: manufacturing knowledge\nmodels, ontology in the manufacturing domain (including fundamentals of ontology\nand ontology based systems), and information \/ knowledge structure for design\n(including feature-based methods, conceptual models, product models and process\nmodels). Finally, research relating to service is described.\n3. Concepts and Key Issues in Knowledge\nmanagement\nWithin manufacturing knowledge, several knowledge management (KM) perspectives\nare described. CEN (Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en de Normalisation, or European committee for\nstandardisation) define knowledge management as:\n\u201cPlanned and ongoing management of activities and processes for leveraging\nknowledge to enhance competitiveness through better use and creation of\nindividual and collective knowledge resources.\u201d (CEN 2004)\nThis definition is intentionally broad, covering a range of activities. Within this\nsection, knowledge management is discussed in terms of integration perspective,\nstrategy and implementation, knowledge mapping, automation, and design\nrepositories and knowledge retrieval.\n3.1 Knowledge Integration\nSzyckman et al. discuss IT infrastructure issues presented by next-generation product\ndevelopment; specifically, the need for the integration of knowledge. They suggest\nthat four areas must contribute: software applications, standards, IT infrastructure and\nPage 6 of 29\norganisation (Szykman et al., 2001). Schneider and Marquardt describe the life cycle\nof a chemical process from an information systems integration perspective. They\nidentify the need for systematic consideration and documentation of good practice.\nThey present three life cycle perspectives: workflow, product data, and software, and\ncomment that workflow and product data are often considered independently, where\nsoftware could be applied as an integrating factor (Schneider & Marquardt 2002). Wu\net al. propose an information framework based on Web services and agent technology\nto manage product development. Collaborative product development requires\ncoordination of functions and information management across multiple phases (Wu et\nal., 2004). In each of these proposals, the main objective is integration of the product\ndevelopment activities within a company \u2013 the issues of sharing knowledge with\nexternal parties has not been addressed. Wu offers the nearest solution, discussing the\ncoordination of \u201cgeographically dispersed internal teams and external partners of the\nproduct development chain\u201d however while the solution offers distributed\ncoordination at the project level it does not support the intricate aspects of detailed\nmodel sharing with external parties at the product level (Wu et al., 2004). It should be\nnoted that their method does offer a practical partial solution, through design\nparameter consistency checking.\n3.2 Strategy and implementation\nBohn presents a framework for measuring and understanding technological\nknowledge \u2013 that is, knowledge about how to produce goods and services (Bohn\n1997). This is an early example of knowledge management in manufacturing, and is\none of the papers included in this review that fell outside the search. It is included as a\nwell cited foundational text that defines many of the issues relating to knowledge\nmanagement in the manufacturing domain.\nShaw and Edwards propose a method that supports design and negotiation of strategic\naction plans for manufacturing KM strategy. They apply a workshop method, with a\ncomputer based decision support system and a brainstorming software package (Shaw\n& Edwards 2006). Wanga studies the implementation of KM in a UK SME. The KM\nimplementation helps the firm (consultants) to generate proposals faster. They can\naccess lessons learned and best practices stored in the repository. The approach is\nfacilitated by IT technologies. A main problem is lack of time to deal with the\nseparate KM system needs (Wonga & Aspinwall 2006). Honga et al. suggest that as\nthe role of design engineers expands, the clarity of project targets increases. This\nincreases the extent of shared knowledge about customers. Together these factors can\nenhance productivity. Design engineers are in a position to integrate manufacturing at\nthe conceptual stage because they possess the knowledge to enable it within a cross\nfunctional team setting (Honga et al., 2005). Morton et al. developed a management\nsupport tool to show the impact of relationships at the boundaries of internal and\nexternal activities. The informal network is crucially important in avoiding barriers\nand delays imposed by the formal structure (Morton et al., 2006). Mapping the\ninformal (social) network is a key feature of the tool. Lu and Botha suggest that\nmanufacturing process development should be viewed as a strategic function for\ncompetitive edge, and as such, specific measures should be applied to improve\nperformance. Process design objectives include: product and process quality, smooth\nand fast ramp-up, cost performance, fast product realisation, and sustainable\ncompetitiveness (innovation) (Lu & Botha 2006).\nPage 7 of 29\n3.3 Knowledge mapping\nSpeel et al. suggest that knowledge mapping can create high level knowledge models\nin a transparent graphical form. As such, knowledge mapping forms a key KM\ntechnique. They also suggest that visualisation of relations between knowledge items\nbrings new insights (Speel et al., 1999). Tan and Platts also propose a knowledge\nmapping approach, based on connectance between concepts. The relationships are\nstored in a database. The method enables visualisation of how variables interact. The\nresult is similar to a relationship diagram, indicating variables with positive negative\nrelationships (Tan & Platts 2004). Wang proposes a requirements management\nmethod in an automotive scenario. A lack of association between requirements and\ndesign makes requirements tracking difficult. The proposed method enables\nrelationships to be captured and tracked by using a matrix. The method is a matrix of\nmatrices, suggesting the use of Axiomatic Design for analysis of some design\nelements and Design Structure Matrix (DSM) for others (Wang 2006).\n3.4 Knowledge management automation\nPham and Afify carried out a review of machine learning, which can help to automate\nknowledge acquisition. Machine learning for very large data sets requires more work,\nas does machine learning for non-numerical data types such as text and images (Pham\n& Afify 2005). Yan demonstrates that a combined knowledge mesh and agent mesh\ncan enable complex knowledge representation for self-reconfiguring complex\nsystems. First order logic relationships are defined (Yan 2006). Koh and Gunasekaran\napply a reference architecture to store \u201ctacit knowledge\u201d and apply a software agent to\ncreate explicit knowledge. \u201cTacit knowledge\u201d refers to buffering and dampening\ntechniques. Their proposal is a stock optimisation method using simulation and\nintelligent agents (Koh & Gunasekaran 2006).\n3.5 Design repositories and knowledge retrieval\nAlizon et al. developed a search system for design repositories that applies\nmanufacturing information to the search methods, considering similarity, efficiency\nand configuration (Aifaoui et al., 2006). Shahbaz et al. show that data mining in\nmanufacturing databases can lead to design improvement or fine tuning of production\nprocesses. The results of the data mining showed information relating to product\ngeometry and limitations for improvement of existing processes (Shahbaz et al.,\n2006). Huang and Liang propose a method to retrieve design knowledge through data\nmining of design databases. Formal modelling of modular products (formulae and\nproduction rules) supports the method (Honga et al., 2005). Gardoni et al. present a\nnovel approach to provide manufacturing knowledge to design teams by storing and\nretrieving text and sketches (Gardoni & Blanco 2005). Their approach is extended to\ninclude semi-structured information (Gardoni et al., 2005).\n4. Knowledge-based intelligent systems\nA range of intelligent systems have been presented in the literature, primarily in the\nareas of manufacturing analysis and design analysis. There is also a subset of\nliterature that focuses on intelligent systems architecture. In this section, \u2018intelligent\nsystems\u2019 refers to self-defined intelligent systems, expert systems, knowledge-based\nsystems, agent-based systems and optimisation systems.\nPage 8 of 29\n4.1 Design analysis and support systems\nAziz and Shappasis develop an intelligent system to support gear design. Knowledge\nbases are used for concept design, detail design, manufacturability evaluation, and\nmanufacturing process design (Aziz & Chassapis 2005). Harding et al. develop a\nfuzzy expert system that applies Quality Function Deployment (QFD) type principles\nto relate customer requirements to product parameters (Harding et al., 2001). Howard\nand Lewis developed an expert system linked to AutoCAD to provide comparison\ndata on material and process combinations. A material and manufacturing database\nwas incorporated into the system. Process specific rules require analysis of the 3D\nmodel to judge suitability of the method. Material properties include mechanical,\nthermal, electrical and environmental (Howard & Lewis 2006). Kumara et al.\ndeveloped an expert system combining AutoCAD and AutoLISP to assess\nmanufacturability of sheet metal parts. Production rules are loaded into AutoCAD,\nwhich checks design features against ease of manufacture (Kumara et al., 2006).\nShehab and Abdalla developed a knowledge-based system (KBS) to support process\ncost modelling and design for automation. The system supports the selection of\nassembly technique, estimates assembly time and cost, and performs analysis of\ndesign for automation (Shehab & Abdalla 2006). Valentincic and Brissaud developed\na manufacturing expert system to support design. The system selects an appropriate\nprocess for a given product feature. The system also highlights features that are weak\nfrom the manufacturing perspective (Valentincic & Brissaud 2005). Ma applies fuzzy\nsets and possibility distributions and extends EXPRESS to make it possible to model\nfuzzy engineering information (Ma 2006). Mok and Wong develop a design\nevaluation system. They suggest that Feature recognition is \u201cthe first prominent stage\nfor any automatic design evaluation system\u201d. Their methodology can recognise\nfeatures of injection moulded parts using a hybrid approach: graph theoretic and logic.\nFeatures are classified as: primitive, complex and high level complex (Mok & Wong\n2006). Swift et al. suggest that probabilistic design should be more widely adopted,\nsince deterministic design fails to provide an understanding of the variable nature of\nmanufacture, materials properties and product use (Swift et al., 2001).\n4.2 Manufacturing analysis and support systems\nThe distinction between design analysis and manufacturing analysis has a weak basis,\nsince it was stated that design is considered as an integral part of manufacturing;\nhowever there are some methods and proposals presented in the literature that are\nmore directly focused on manufacturing (i.e. production) than design. Xie et al.\ndeveloped a knowledge based decision support system for sheet metal parts. The\nsystem includes a design and manufacturing knowledge based module for design\nsupport. The system abstracts geometric entities (such as thickness and radius) to\nsupport product design and modelling (Xie et al., 2001). Cakir and Cavdar developed\na knowledge based system that helps to identify solutions to problems in metal cutting\n(milling, drilling, turning). The system also provides recommendations for cutting\nparameters (feed, speed, depth of cut). The problem resolution system uses a\n\u201cproblem, cause and remedy\u201d database (Cakir & Cavdar 2006). Shakeri develops a\ncombined process planning and tool selection system. The system allows\nimplementation of manufacturing knowledge from an owned facility and from\nexternal sites. Previously, operation sequencing and tool selection had been combined\ninto a single optimisation problem, but not implemented in a CAM system (Shakeri\n2004). Landryova and Irgens developed a rule-based expert system that combines\nPage 9 of 29\nwith process monitoring systems to support process management in the oil industry.\nThe aim is to reduce process noise, or variability (Landryova & Irgens 2006). Liu et\nal. outline a framework for a STEP-NC controller. The conceptual controller consists\nof an interpreting module, planning module, simulation module and CNC kernel. The\ninterpreter reads an AP238 file and converts it into internal data, which the planner\nthen applies to the sequencing of machining operations (Liu et al., 2006). Di Stefano\nproposes a tolerance analysis method that optimises manufacturing costs based on an\ninteraction between customer requirements, design parameters and process variables.\nThis approach takes a holistic, statistical view of the product and applies cost factors\nfrom manufacturing tolerances and quality loss (Di Stefano 2006). Vyatkin and\nChristensen propose a software architecture to support automated production systems.\nThe architecture is composed of software modules called function blocks (Vyatkin &\nChristensen 2005). Yongtaoa and Jingying developed a computer aided process\nplanning system, using a features framework to derive manufacturing features and\nmapping to machining operations. The system generates an optimal process plan\nbased on minimum tool changes and operations (Yongtaoa & Jingying 2006).\n4.3 Agent based systems\nThe research in this section applies software agents to a manufacturing knowledge\nproblem. Feng states that \u201cAgents provide mechanisms to interact with each other\u201d\n(Feng 2005). This will be applied to a working definition for agents in this context \u2013 a\nsoftware component with a predefined goal and a mechanism to interact with other\nsoftware components. Balakrishnan et al. define four categories of intelligent\ninformation processes: intelligent search, diagnosis and prognosis, collaboration and\ncoordination, and understanding and learning. They suggest that software agents\nprovide an ideal platform for intelligent manufacturing process support (Balakrishnan\net al., 1999). Feng developed an integrated conceptual design and process planning\nmethod that uses software agents. The method interfaces with a CAD system. Factors\nsuch as form, material, tolerance, surface condition, etc. are used in design analysis.\nThis analysis then queries a knowledge base to propose suitable manufacturing\nprocesses (Feng 2005). Harding et al. demonstrate the engineering moderator concept.\nIt is an intelligent support tool that uses software agents to aid manufacturing system\ndesign by monitoring a design database to detect changes and identify conflicts in\norder to provide the relevant agent (designer, project manager, etc.) with details of the\nchange and its effects (Harding et al., 2003).\n5. Manufacturing knowledge and information\nmodels\nMuch of the work cited here on manufacturing information models has been\ndeveloped within the same group at Loughborough University. Some references that\nfell outside of the search criteria were added here as they provide a foundation for the\nwork in manufacturing models. Several other references were identified that proposed\na manufacturing model, however in the context of this review they were considered\nmore closely related to other sections.\nMolina and Bell propose an information model that describes the capability of a\nmanufacturing enterprise. This model supports manufacturing decision making in the\nconcurrent design of products. It is intended to be applied at different levels, to meet\nthe need of a variety of perspectives. The model consists of: Resources, Processes and\nPage 10 of 29\nStrategies. The understanding of a manufacturing resource is based on a fundamental\nhierarchical view: factory, shop, cell, station (Molina & Bell 1999). Molina and Bell\nlater carried out a review of reference models for supporting engineering. Their\nresulting proposal combines two methods: CIMOSA (Computer Integrated\nManufacturing Open System Architecture) and RM-ODP (Reference Model for Open\nDistributed Processing). CIMOSA allows the setting of context and requirements of\nCAE systems in an integrated enterprise. RM-ODP supports the definition of structure\nand characteristics (enterprise, information, computational, engineering and\ntechnology) of CAE systems. The resulting CAE framework is intended to assist in\nspecifying and developing future computer based engineering support systems\n(Molina & Bell 2002).\nHarding and Yu develop a factory model, providing information about the capability\nof the proposed enterprise. Data warehousing contains information about the existing\nbusiness (timings, inventory, breakdown history). The factory model describes a class\nstructure model (a \u2018facility\u2019 has resource, strategy, process) (Harding & Yu 1999).\nHarding and Popplewell propose a factory design software environment, to support\ndesign of facilities and processes in parallel with products. The method incorporates a\nfactory data model structure (FDMS), consisting of a set of data classes: process,\nresource, strategy, facility and token. They demonstrate that a factory model can be\nprogressively populated, providing valuable information to designers (Harding &\nPopplewell 1999).\n5.1 Ontology in manufacturing knowledge modelling\nGruber defines an ontology as an \u201cexplicit specification of a conceptualization\u201d\n(Gruber 1993). A conceptualization is a body of formally represented knowledge; a\n\u201csimplified view of the world that we wish to represent for some purpose\u201d (Gruber\n1993). CEN refer to ontology simply as \u2018structured terminology\u2019 (CEN 2004).\nOntology is being applied to formal modelling and reasoning domains, enhancing\ninteroperability.\nCiocoiu et al. suggest that the purpose of ontologies in engineering applications is to\nmake semantics more explicit by providing unambiguous definitions of product and\nprocess capabilities. They develop a system to translate from IDEF3 to ILOG via\nProcess Specification Language (PSL \u2013 see section 3.7), using ontology descriptions\nto enable information exchange (Ciocoiu et al., 2001). Nanda et al. suggest that there\nis a need for a methodology to develop ontologies for design artefacts. They go on to\npropose a systematic methodology for constructing ontologies to support product\nfamily design (Nanda et al., 2006). Crowther et al. assess the suitability of\nCommonKADS as a methodology to capture knowledge, assessing whether the result\nis reusable and suitable as the basis for an ontology. They find that the result is not\ndirectly suitable for the basis of a domain ontology, but that it serves as a good\nstarting point (Crowther et al., 2003).\nKuczynski et al. suggest that ontologies are a powerful means to store and retrieve\nknowledge. A single ontology has obvious advantages but is not realistic. Mapping\nindividual ontologies is extensive and cumbersome. A hybrid ontology approach is\ntherefore proposed, using a shared vocabulary (Kuczynski et al., 2006). Qiu\ndeveloped an information integration framework for the manufacturing enterprise. A\ndomain ontology enables common shared semantics. Three types of integration are\nPage 11 of 29\ncommonly applied: data, application, and information. A lack of integration leads to\nincomplete, irrelevant or out of date knowledge bases (Qiu 2006).\nBorgo and Leitao ague against the view that general ontologies are unsuitable for real\napplications. They propose that foundational ontologies, the most general ontologies,\nhave a crucial role to play in building reusable, adaptable and transparent application\nsystems. They demonstrate how they can be used in manufacturing control by\nadapting a domain specific ontology such that it meets the theoretical organisation\nrequirements of a foundational ontology (Borgo & Leitao 2004).\nCheeseman et al. developed an agent-based scheduling method incorporating dynamic\nscheduling to account for breakdown, operator illness and changing priorities. The\nsystem is developed using an ontology described using XML (Cheeseman et al.,\n2005). Cheung et al. demonstrate the application of a knowledge management editor\ntool to structure organisational knowledge and integrate it with product development.\nThe knowledge editor tool helps to develop an axiom controlled ontology (Cheung et\nal., 2006). Cochrane et al. develop a method that enables knowledge sharing in\nmanufacturing. They developed a manufacturability analysis platform that applies the\nPSL ontology as a basis for describing processes (Cochrane et al., 2005). Lin et al.\npropose an ontology to make the manufacturing system engineering moderator\napplicable to an extended enterprise through use of shared terms, enhancing semantic\ninteroperability (Lin et al., 2004). Yoshiokaa et al. propose a physical concept\nontology to support integration of CAD and CAE at the data level or knowledge level.\nA functional model maps to a metamodel using physical features. The ontology\nsupports knowledge level modelling for reasoning processes (Yoshiokaa et al., 2004).\nLin et al. propose a method for sharing knowledge through use of ontology:\nmaintaining information autonomy through mapping onto a common central ontology,\nwhilst maintaining individual preferences for terminology. The purpose of the system\nis to support conflict resolution in the design process through change monitoring (Lin\net al., 2005). A methodology for developing ontologies is also required (Nanda et al.,\n2006).\n6. Engineering design knowledge and information\nmodels\nSeveral methods are presented in the research to model products to support distributed\ndesign, design model sharing and design analysis. Here they are divided into product\ndata models and design process models.\n6.1 Product data models\nMa defines the requirements for engineering information modelling in databases and\ncarried out a review to support researchers in the field. Requirements include complex\nobjects and relationships, data exchange and sharing, web-based method, imprecision\nand uncertainty, and knowledge management. The paper focuses on storage of\nEXPRESS \/ STEP conceptual representations (Ma 2005). Aifaoui et al. propose\n\u2018mechanical analysis features\u2019 as part of a semantically rich product model to support\ninteroperability between design and analysis processes (Aifaoui et al., 2006). Zhang\net al. review Internet-based product information sharing and visualisation. They carry\nout a case study, in which STEP is used to establish a product data master model that\nPage 12 of 29\nsupports sharing of 3D structures. The objective of the master model is to capture all\nessential and interrelated information and product properties (Zhang et al., 2004).\nAlisanto et al. propose a purpose-behaviour product structure to support collaborative\nproduct development. Functional and non functional attributes can be traced to the\ncorresponding product structure elements (Alisantoso et al., 2003). Krishnapillai and\nZeid suggest that mass customisation with mass production efficiency requires tight\nintegration of requirements gathering, product design and manufacturing. They\npropose a methodology to classify design information that can accommodate design\nvariations. Their example applies a design matrix to a simple product design\n(Krishnapillai & Zeid 2006). Lee et al. develop a method that supports the\nrequirements collection phase of product modelling by formally defining the terms\nand grammar that can be used in defining the product model. EXPRESS is applied to\nthe product model. The method formalises product structures and relationships\n(product has a part is type of part, etc.) (Lee et al., 2006). Ihara and Zhu propose a tree\nstructure to represent design that overcomes problems with sharing manufacturing\nknowledge transfer across different production cultures. This tree structure is used to\ngenerate a process plan. The tree structure provides key product qualities as focus\npoints. This enables the creation of an appropriate plan (Ihara & Zhu 2003).\nMatta et al. present an approach to capture knowledge without disturbing the\ndesigner\u2019s activities. The approach keeps track of knowledge produced, as a\nbehaviour model linking functions and product structure. Design process modelling is\nalso part of the method, using GRAI nets. This supports the capture of design history\n(Matta et al., 2002). Wang et al. propose a method to enhance engineering data\nsecurity management in a peer to peer collaborative environment. Heterogenous\ndesign data are exchanged selectively through an XML common interface. Integrated\ngeometric and non-geometric XML data representation using encrypted XML enables\nsharing of partial models in a secure manner (Wang et al., 2006). Sharing and security\nare major issues in the manufacturing knowledge domain.\n6.2 Design process models\nGruninger and Menzel describe the Process Specification Language (PSL). PSL is\ndesigned to facilitate exchange of process information among a range of\nmanufacturing systems (scheduling, process modelling, process planning, production\nplanning, simulation...) (Gruninger & Menzel 2003). Whilst this is not a design\nprocess method, the formal representation applied by KIF serves as a good\ncomparison against design process representation approaches. PSL serves as a means\nto formally describe manufacturing operations. It does not readily support product\ndescription.\nKrishnan and Ulrich review the literature on product development decisions. They\nidentify four perspectives in product development: engineering design (individual-\nengineer perspective), marketing, operations management (sometimes bridging these\nperspectives), and organisations (aggregate level) (Krishnan & Ulrich 2001). The\ndecision perspective helps to identify the support required for design decisions.\nLutters et al. describe a method to manage information in engineering processes. They\nsuggest that design and engineering activities need information as input, and that\nanalysing that information is of the utmost importance. If it can be formalised and\nstructured, it can serve as the basis for control of design and manufacturing processes.\nPage 13 of 29\nThey suggest a structure including product, information and resource (Lutters et al.,\n2000).\nMolina et al. carried out a review on next generation manufacturing systems:\nreconfigurable and intelligent machines. They suggest that in design of mechatronic\nsystems, development is needed to improve the accuracy and ease of use of simulation\ntools, and that optimisation methods (mechanics, electronics and software) are still\nvery limited. As such, design requires an integrated development methodology, based\non concurrent engineering and life cycle engineering principles. They suggest that\nproduct models and manufacturing models could support these activities (Molina et\nal., 2005). Soares suggests that a simulation tool for production systems can be used\nto improve organisational structure and to create shared understanding of\norganisational issues (Soares 2002). This approach requires the creation of formal\ndefinitions of the business processes that the manufacturing organisation carries out.\nMadhusudan developed an advanced model for information integration and dynamic\nprocess management. Three elements are combined: modular software frameworks\n(Web Services); semantic markup languages; and intelligent process control\nframeworks. This framework supports product lifecycle management: knowledge\nregarding products is managed from concept to obsolescence, including process\nrelated (how-to) and product related (what-is) knowledge (Madhusudan 2004). Lee et\nal. developed a data transformation method to enable data from a relational database\nto be used in a knowledge based system. They propose an XML product data\nexchange standard, using object principles (polymorphism and inheritance). Previous\ncases are retrieved through CBR (Lee et al., 2006). Since the proposals are targeted\ntowards product life cycle management, there is a strong emphasis on the process.\n7. Service knowledge\nDaniels and Bryson review aspects of the debate about the distinction between service\nand manufacturing activities and suggest that it needs to be reconsidered in relation to\nchanges taking place in the production process (Daniels & Bryson 2002). Service is\nan increasingly important element of production, and the line between products and\nservices is becoming less clear. In maintenance service, Moore and Starr propose an\nintelligent system that brings together equipment condition monitor alarms, cost\ninformation and risk factors to prioritise maintenance activities (Moore & Starr 2006).\nThis research demonstrates an intelligent approach to maintenance, integrating a range\nof knowledge types to support decision making. It does not address service in its\nwider context or service knowledge in design. The search strategy applied did not\nprovide any papers that consider service knowledge in a design context.\n8. Analysis of research in the manufacturing\nknowledge domain\nThere is a great deal of crossover between the categories presented in the above\ndescription of current literature, which was divided largely based on the academic\ndiscipline. Several of the papers could have been included in more than one of the\nselected disciplines. Further analysis will take place to identify the position of the\nresearch from two different perspectives: the application domain, and the life cycle\nstage. The analysis by application domain will show which area of a manufacturing\nenterprise the research contributes to (focusing here on design and production). The\nPage 14 of 29\nanalysis by life cycle stage will show where the research contributes according to the\nstage of the product life cycle.\n8.1 Categorisation of reviewed papers\nThe papers were assessed and\ngrouped into categories, with each\ncategory representing the target\narea within a manufacturing\nenterprise for the proposed\nsolution or method. In this\nanalysis, each paper was only\nplaced into a single category. The\ncategories are shown in Table 1.\nIn order to provide context and a\nbasis for comparison, the\ncategories are represented\ngraphically in Figure 3. The\nmanufacturing enterprise domain\nis divided into two sub-domains: design and production. The categories identified are\ngrouped according to these domains. It can be seen from the figure that 22 of the 74\npapers categorised are targeted at the enterprise level. This includes general\nknowledge management methods, enterprise application integration methods, role\nanalysis techniques and knowledge sharing methods. In the design and production\ndomain, the categories were assigned according to design (25), production (7), and\nboth design and production (14). This analysis highlights a design bias in the\nmanufacturing knowledge domain. The content of each domain is shown in Figure 3.\nInformation \/\nknowledge\nstructure for design\n(17)\nKBS \/ expert\nsystem (11)\nontology for design\nknowledge\nmanagement (8)\nKM (7)\nknowledge sharing\nin manufacturing (7)\nenterprise\napplication\nintegration (5)\nmanufacturing\nsystem (factory)\ndesign (4)\nprocess planning\n(3)\nrole analysis (3)\nproduction \/\nmaintenance\nscheduling (3)\nManufacturing\nEnterprise\nDesign Production\n(14)(25) (7)\n(22)\nFigure 3: Graphical representation of the papers by categories\nTable 1: categories of reviewed papers\nCategory No papers\nInformation \/ knowledge structure for design 17\nExpert systems, knowledge-based systems 11\nOntology in the manufacturing domain 8\nKnowledge management 7\nKnowledge sharing in manufacturing 7\nEnterprise application integration 5\nManufacturing system (factory) design 4\nProcess planning 3\nProduction \/ maintenance scheduling 3\nRole analysis 3\nOther 6\nPage 15 of 29\n8.2 Papers addressing different life cycle stages\nProduct development is often described in a systematic sense, in which a sequence of\nactivities, or design stages, is defined. A much cited example is developed by Ulrich\nand Eppinger (Ulrich & Eppinger 2000), consisting of a sequential model including\nplanning, concept development, system level design, detail design, testing, and\nproduction. This view of the NPD process model does not describe the whole product\nlife cycle, since it ends at \u2018production\u2019. The move towards product life cycle models\nprovides a more complete basis for information and data management, and from that\nperspective a more complete description of the information and knowledge required\nduring the design stage. A manufacturer\u2019s view of a product\u2019s life cycle is described\nby Stark (Stark 2004), in which five stages are proposed: imagine, define, realise,\nservice, and retire. Stark\u2019s\nmodel adds the dimension\nof product support\n(service) and end of life,\nbut it provides very little\ndetail in the product\ndefinition stage. The life\ncycle model presented as\npart of the CIMOSA\nmodelling framework\nshows the stages\nidentification, concept,\nrequirements, preliminary\ndesign, detailed design,\nimplementation, operation\nand decommission\n(Kosanke et al., 1999).\nThis could be argued to be\nlimited in the end of life\nsection according to\nrecent life cycle models\n\u201cthe product life cycle\nstarts with product design, followed by product manufacturing, product servicing and\nproduct remanufacturing\u201d (Aurich et al., 2006). The CIMOSA framework will be\nadopted since it includes multiple design phases and it includes stages in the life cycle\nbeyond the \u2018use\u2019 phase.\nThe CIMOSA modelling framework shown in Figure 4 has two additional\ndimensions: instantiation and view. Instantiation refers to the level at which the model\nis defined:\n\u201cGeneric enterprise modelling concepts provide means for modelling\nconstructs consistency like language semantic and syntax\u2019s definitions through\nontologies, formal languages, glossaries, etc. Partial enterprise models provide\nmodels which can be reused by modifying enterprise specific attributes of\nactivities and processes\u2026 The elements identified in each life-cycle phase of\nthe reference architecture are the building blocks or constructs to be used in\nthe creation of a particular enterprise model.\u201d (Kosanke et al., 1999)\nFigure 4: CIMOSA modelling framework (Kosanke et al., 1999)\nPage 16 of 29\nView refers to a method for dividing the model:\n\u201cThis concept of views allows one to work with subsets of the model rather\nthan with the complete model, providing especially the business user with\nreduced complexity for his particular area of concern. CIMOSA has defined\nfour different modelling views (Function, Information, Resource and\nOrganisation). However, this set of views may be extended if needed.\u201d\n(Kosanke 1995)\nThis analysis will show the intended life cycle phase for the proposed manufacturing\nknowledge methods and the granularity: whether it describes generic modelling\nconcept or a partial enterprise model. Views are not appropriate in this analysis.\nGeneric Partial\nIdentification\n(0)\nConcept\n(0)\nRequirements\n(3)\nScenario Granularity\nLi\nfe\nC\nyc\nle\nP\nha\nse\nPreliminary\nDesign: (29)\nDetailed\nDesign (42)\nImplementation\n(12)\nOperation\n(1)\nRemanufacture\n\/ Decommission\n(0)\n3\n3\n16\n17\n10\n1\n1 6\n12\n1\n12\nGeneric:\n11\nPartial:\n62\nLife cycle phase\n(number of papers)\nFigure 5: Analysis of manufacturing knowledge methods and tools\naccording to life cycle stage and granularity\nThe analysis shows total numbers according to columns (granularity). The numbers\nshown corresponding to life cycle stage refer to the number of methods and tools that\ncontribute directly to that stage; those which are focused on supporting the particular\nneeds of those activities. This removes the generic knowledge management or\nenterprise modelling methods that contribute to the whole product life cycle, and\nPage 17 of 29\nbetter reflects where the research focus is relevant to that particular stage of the\nproduct life cycle.\nThe granularity addressed by the manufacturing knowledge research is very much\nbiased towards the \u2018partial\u2019 (models which can be reused by modifying enterprise\nspecific attributes): 62 of the 73 included in the analysis. There is still a clear focus on\nthe generic: 11 of the 73 papers address fundamental research into modelling methods\nand knowledge and information structures.\nThe life cycle stage analysis has shown that identification and concept tasks are not\naddressed in the manufacturing domain. To some extent this is a semantic mismatch;\nseveral papers would argue that they address conceptual design, however at this level\nthe work is more closely matched to preliminary design. 3 papers addressed\nrequirements methods \u2013 each one integrating requirements and preliminary design. 29\npapers focused on preliminary design, 16 of which were also concerned with detail\ndesign aspects. 42 papers addressed detailed design, of which 9 related to generic, or\nfundamental, issues. 12 papers address implementation, or production.\nThe manufacturing enterprise is described in Figure 3, including the two sub-domains\n\u2018design\u2019 and \u2018production\u2019. From that perspective it was shown that there is a design\nbias in the research. The life cycle analysis in Figure 5 also shows a design bias: a\ncombined total of 47 papers contribute to the preliminary and detailed design phases.\nProduction (implementation) has only 12. This indicates that the recent focus of the\nmanufacturing knowledge domain is significantly biased towards design. The focus\non design also indicates that researchers consider the manufacturing domain from an\nenterprise perspective.\nOf the remaining life cycle phases, operation (service) has only 1, and remanufacture \/\ndecommission has 0. Significant growth is expected in this area. The developing\nresearch area of product-service-systems (PSS) and a growing demand for end of life\nmanagement will form a part of the future in this domain. Integration of PSS, design\nand manufacturing research is expected to follow as the domains mature.\n9. Trends in manufacturing knowledge research\nIn this section the categories are compared against publication dates in order to\nidentify trends. In each case, the date range is 2001-2006, to reflect trends identified\nby the adopted search strategy. The first analysis view compares publication date with\ncategory. The categories used are those described in Table 1. The result is shown in\nFigure 6.\nPage 18 of 29\nAnalysis of publication dates by category\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\nYear\nN\nu\nm\nb\ner\no\nfp\nap\ner\ns\nInformation \/ knowledge\nstructure for design\nKBS \/ expert system\nKM\nKnowledge sharing in\nmanufacturing\nOntology for design\nknowledge management\nEnterprise application\nintegration\nManufacturing system\n(factory) design\nProcess planning\nProduction \/ maintenance\nscheduling\nRole analysis\nFigure 6: analysis of publication date vs. category\nThe analysis shows an overall trend similar to the publication pattern in Figure 2: a\nrelatively stable publication rate, increasing significantly in 2006. The largest\ncategory growth was seen in information \/ knowledge structure for design. KBS and\nexpert systems also saw something of a revival, and knowledge sharing in\nmanufacturing also shows significant growth. Even with this growth the knowledge\nsharing category remains small in 2006 with only 4 papers.\nPage 19 of 29\nAnalysis of publication date aganst life cycle stage\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\nYear\nN\num\nb\ner\nof\np\nap\ner\ns\nALL\nRequirements\nPreliminary Design\nDetailed Design\nImplementation\nOperation\nFigure 7: analysis of date vs. life cycle stage\nThe second analysis view compares publication date against the relevant life cycle\nstage of the proposed manufacturing knowledge method or system. Again, the general\npattern follows a sharp increase in 2005 and 2006. The sharp rise in research focused\non detailed design is against expectation according to recent trends in design research,\nalthough it is in line with the positioning of manufacturing knowledge as that closest\nto detailed design in the design life cycle. Preliminary design also sees a sharp rise in\nthe number of publications from 2004-2006. Implementation focused research also\nsees a modest increase over the period 2004-2006. The other life cycle stages appear\nstable; the numbers do not increase.\nPage 20 of 29\nAnalysis of publication date against granularity\n24\n14\n7\n44\n5\n6\n11\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\nYear\nN\nu\nm\nb\ner\no\nf\np\nap\ner\ns\nPartial\nGeneric\nFigure 8: analysis of date vs. granularity\nGranularity refers to a spectrum ranging from the theoretical (model constructs) to the\npractical (implemented system) in enterprise modelling. It has been applied to the\nanalysis of manufacturing knowledge methods and tools to identify whether they\nrepresent directly usable methods or foundational concepts. The generic\n(foundational) level refers to modelling constructs, language semantics and definitions\nthrough ontologies, formal languages, and glossaries. The partial level refers to\nenterprise models that can be reused by modifying enterprise specific attributes.\nThe analysis shows that the manufacturing knowledge domain is more focused on the\napplication than the underlying modelling constructs and languages: partial level\nresearch contributes four times the number of papers in 2006: 24 vs. 6. Both have\nincreased significantly from 2004-2006.\n10. Recommended Future research\nThe manufacturing knowledge domain is largely application driven: companies are\nvery much involved in defining the research agenda. Overcoming shortcomings or\ngaps in current applications forms one stream of research, and the development of\nfuture applications forms another stream of research. In both cases, researchers should\ncontinue to look to industry in identifying research issues.\nThe research community has recently increased their recognition of the need for\nstandards and knowledge level integration across the manufacturing enterprise.\n\u2018Information and knowledge structures for design\u2019 is the category showing the highest\ngrowth. This fits with the view of the domain as application driven: integration of\nmanufacturing and design requires the development of information and knowledge\nstructures. This is expected to increase in the near future. In this domain, researchers\nshould collaborate with industry and each other to ensure that the development of\nPage 21 of 29\nstandards takes account of existing standards as well as industry needs and practices.\nAn interesting growth area for researchers is thought to be more focused on the\napplication of standards than their development: developing methodologies for the\nadoption and implementation of knowledge level standards, as well as describing case\nstudies with successes or failures of these projects.\nKBS and expert systems are also expected to continue their rise, again showing that\nthe research community is driven by applications. In this area, new research should\ntake account of developments in emerging standards and developments in information\nand knowledge structures.\nFocus on the various life cycle stages is expected to continue with the current trends:\nboth preliminary and detailed design will see an increasing amount of focus in the\nmanufacturing knowledge domain. The actual content of the detailed design focus\nwill continue to evolve as the design \/ manufacturing transfer becomes more\nknowledge intensive and less resource intensive. Systems are currently commercially\navailable that can generate NC code from CAD models. This closer integration\nbetween the design output and manufacturing input is resulting in a change of\nemphasis in the detailed design phase for manufacturing engineers, and accordingly\nfor the research community. Further work is expected in this area, including\nknowledge based methods in areas such as design \/ manufacturing process\noptimisation, and research applications implementing standards such as STEP-NC.\nThe long term view of manufacturing knowledge research is an expected shift in focus\nbrought about by an increase in detailed design automation and support. The\nincreasing trend for automation and knowledge level support in the detail design\nphase will support an increase in preliminary design research. When preliminary\ndesign research matures, this will enable the manufacturing knowledge research\ncommunity to expand beyond preliminary design into the requirements and\nconceptual design stages. Again, knowledge level support is fundamental in\nsupporting these changes.\nIn the near term, it is expected that a focus on service will arise. Current developments\nin product service systems and an increase in full service support packages are\ncreating a need to better integrate design, manufacturing and service operations. The\nmanufacturing knowledge research domain can contribute to this at the knowledge\nlevel and at the systems level through defining manufacturing and service activities\nsuch that they can interoperate and provide feedback to the design activity. The\nmanufacturing knowledge research community must recognise and embrace the shift\ntowards integrated services to better support integrated product-service design and to\nsupport an increase in external services in the manufacturing operation. Alongside\nservice, remanufacture and decommissioning is an area currently lacking in the\nmanufacturing knowledge domain. In order to effectively integrate these activities\ninto the enterprise, particularly design, manufacturing knowledge researchers must\ndevelop methods to describe remanufacture and decommissioning of products at the\nknowledge level. This will support those industries obliged by regulation to take\nresponsibility for their products at the end of life, which includes automotive and\nwhite goods.\nPage 22 of 29\nFrom the systems perspective there remain a number of research challenges yet to be\naddressed. One of those challenges is inter-enterprise communication. The research\nhas a predominantly intra-enterprise focus. A very few of the papers identified by this\nreview describe methods to manage inter-enterprise manufacturing knowledge. This is\nan area that needs further work.\n11. Conclusions\nThe conclusions drawn can be summarised as:\n\uf0b7 Manufacturing knowledge research is application driven\n\uf0b7 More fundamental research is needed; industry should be included\n\uf0b7 There is a clear design bias in the manufacturing knowledge literature\n\uf0b7 Detailed design is the focus; preliminary design is growing\n\uf0b7 There is a lack of research in the identification and concept stages\n\uf0b7 Service research is severely lacking\n\uf0b7 Remanufacture and decommissioning research is also severely lacking\nThe manufacturing knowledge research can be considered from a variety of views: in\nthis review paper the views considered were: academic disciplines, application\ndomain (enterprise view), and life cycle stage. The academic disciplines showed the\nvariety of approaches available to capture, represent and manage knowledge. The\nenterprise view showed how there is a clear design bias in the manufacturing\nknowledge literature, although integration between design and production is\nwidespread. The product life cycle view demonstrates a lack of manufacturing\nknowledge research in the identification and concept stages. This is partly a semantic\ngap: several of the manufacturing researchers would claim that they are working on\nconceptual design, whereas they have been classified as preliminary design in this\nanalysis. Service (operation) is clearly under represented in the manufacturing\nknowledge domain. Service knowledge is of growing importance, particularly in light\nof the shifting nature of production and service. Implementation (production) also has\nvery little work from the perspective of this review. Manufacturing knowledge\nintegration is lacking in these areas, and represents a research gap. Remanufacture and\ndecommissioning has no work in this domain. Again, this represents a research gap.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the support of the EPSRC through Cranfield\nUniversity IMRC in funding this research.
