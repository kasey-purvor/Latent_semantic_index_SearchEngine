INTRODUCTION\nIon channels are natural nanotubes in cellular membranes\n\u00031,2\u0004, capable of conducting up to 108 ions per second, se-\nlectively, through the membrane. They control a vast range\nof biological functions. Understanding their properties from\nphysical first principles is a long-standing fundamental sci-\nentific problem of great interdisciplinary importance, with\nnumerous potential applications, including, e.g., a fast grow-\ning area of research in nanofluids \u00033\u0004. Theoretical treatments\nof ion transport through channel proteins may be classified\nbroadly as rate theoretical approaches \u00034\u0004, electrodiffusion\nmodels \u00035\u0004, stochastic models \u00036\u0004, or molecular-dynamical\nmodels \u00037\u0004. Of these, the first two have the advantage of\nproviding analytic insight into the properties of ion channels\nover a wide range of parameters. For example, analytic ap-\nproximations for the Poisson equation in the pore have been\nderived in \u00038\u201310\u0004. Quasianalytic estimations of the channel\ncurrent-voltage characteristics using the Poisson-Nernst-\nPlanck \u0001PNP\u0002 theory became indispensable numerical tools\nin ion channel analysis because of their simplicity, physical\nclarity, and good quantitative agreement with experimental\nresults \u000311\u201315\u0004. At the same time, in most cases, the access\nresistance \u0001AR\u0002 of the channel\u2019s two apertures contributes\nbetween 10% and 30% of the overall channel resistance \u000316\u0004\nand there are channels for which the AR is believed to limit\nthe channel\u2019s conductivity \u000317\u0004.\nSeveral studies have focused on the analytic and numeri-\ncal determination of the AR for ion channels. Hall \u000318\u0004 de-\nrived the AR by modeling the electrolyte as a homogeneous\nOhmic conducting medium. Using the same considerations\nand by approximating the channel as a cylindrical tube, Hille\n\u000319\u0004 calculated the channel resistance by taking into account\nthe access resistance on both sides of the channel as well as\nthe pore resistance. This result was later extended by Sansom\nand Kerr \u000320\u0004 to consider a channel of nonuniform radius.\nFurther insight was provided by Peskoff and Bers \u000321\u0004 who\nsolved the Poisson-Boltzmann-Nernst-Planck \u0001PBNP\u0002 equa-\ntions \u0001numerically and analytically in a number of approxi-\nmations\u0002 in the bulk from infinity to a hemisphere around the\nchannel mouth in spherical symmetry. Their calculations did\nnot, however, combine conductivity in the bulk and in the\nchannel. Levadny et al. \u000322\u0004 introduced an approximation for\nthe AR in the hemisphere around the channel mouth assum-\ning straight flux lines inside the hemisphere. Numerical cal-\nculations of the AR at the channel mouth are also available\n\u000323\u0004 as well as numerical solutions of the full three-\ndimensional \u00013D\u0002 set of PNP equations in the channel \u000324\u0004\nand Poisson-Boltzmann \u0001PB\u0002 equations in the bulk and in the\nchannel \u000325\u0004. Very interesting asymptotic results for the ac-\ncess resistance problem of uncharged particles, where the\nmean time of absorption of a Brownian particle to a narrow\nwindow is calculated, were obtained in \u000326\u0004. The AR prob-\nlem was considered in \u000313,27,28\u0004 where a modification of the\nDonnan potential formalism and the PNP model were used to\nobtain an approximation for the electrostatic potential at the\ninterface between the channel and the surrounding ionic so-\nlution. This approximation is valid for channels longer than\n20 \u00c5 and requires a stepwise change in the excess chemical\npotential at the channel entrance as well as charge neutrality\ninside the channel.\nDespite all this recent progress, an analytic solution able\nto connect in a self-consistent manner the ion currents and\nthe electrostatic potentials in the access resistance region in\nthe bulk with those in the pore is still lacking. If available,\nsuch a solution would allow for simultaneous semianalytic\nestimations of the AR and the current in many real ion chan-\nnels, providing further physical insight into their properties.\nIt would also allow one to set up boundary conditions \u0001BCs\u0002\nfor the electric field and concentrations at the channel\nmouths in a self-consistent way. It is therefore very desirable\nto extend the theory by seeking self-consistent simultaneous\nsolutions of the AR problem and the PBNP in the bulk, and\nthe PNP solution in the pore.\nIn this paper we present such an extension, combining\nboth solutions by means of a simple quasianalytic iterative\nprocedure. The solution is continuous in concentration, elec-\ntrostatic potential, and electric field, and it satisfies Dirichlet\nboundary conditions for the concentration and the potential\nin the bulk at plus and minus infinity. It is valid for any\nnumber of monovalent ion species and allows for simulta-\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 80, 021925 \u00012009\u0002\n1539-3755\/2009\/80\u00012\u0002\/021925\u000112\u0002 \u00a92009 The American Physical Society021925-1\nneous self-consistent estimations of the access resistance, the\npotential, and the current for each species.\nThe system considered is made of three compartments\n\u0001see Fig. 1\u0002.

To obtain a simultaneous self-consistent solution\nin the bulk and in the pore, a matching procedure is devel-\noped. Using this procedure the I-V characteristics are calcu-\nlated for Gramicidin A \u0001GA\u0002 channel and the results of cal-\nculations are compared with the experimental results\nobtained by two different groups. The access resistance\nfound using this procedure is compared with the AR calcu-\nlated from the Hall formula.\nThe paper is organized as follows. First, in Sec. II, we\nsolve the 1D approximation of the PNP equations in the pore.\nWe also consider the significance of the filling factor. Next,\nin Sec. III, we obtain the solution of the PBNP equations in\nthe bulk for spherical symmetry. We demonstrate in Sec. IV\nthat the boundary condition problem for solutions of the\nequations inside and outside the channel can be resolved\nuniquely. The joint solution is then obtained in Sec. V and\ncompared with experimental results. In Sec. VI we analyze\nchannel properties by investigating the influences of mem-\nbrane fixed charge and bulk concentration on the permeation\nprocess. Finally, in Sec. VII, we summarize and present con-\nclusions.\nFIG. 1. Geometry of the model system under consideration.

SOLUTION OF THE PNP EQUATIONS IN THE\nCHANNEL\nA. 1D solution of the Poisson equation\nUseful insight \u0001see, e.g., \u000312\u201315\u0004 and references therein\u0002\ninto the functions of many channels can be obtained from a\none-dimensional approximation of Eqs. \u00011\u0002 and \u00012\u0002 within\nthe channel, modeling it as a tube with cylindrical symmetry.\nUsing results of \u00038,9\u0004 the Poisson equation for a long narrow\nchannel can be written as\n\u2212 \u0003\nd2\u0004\u02dc\ndx\u02dc2\n= zpep\u02dcex + e\u0005\nj=1\nN\nzjn\u02dcj + \u0003\u02dc\u0006\u0007\u02dc \n1 \u2212 x\u02dcd\u000b \u2212 \u0004\u02dc\u0007 ,\n\u0004\u02dc \u0001x\u02dc0\u0002 = \u0004\u02dc 0, \u0004\u02dc \u0001x\u02dc1\u0002 = \u0004\u02dc 1, Vapp = \u0004\u02dc 1 \u2212 \u0004\u02dc 0 = \u0007\u02dc . \u00015\u0002\nThis approximation is valid for any number N of ionic spe-\ncies in the solution. For simplicity, the dielectric constant is\ntaken to be independent of time and space. The first term on\nthe right-hand side represents the linear density of permanent\ncharge on the atoms of the protein, i.e., the charge that is\nindependent of the electric field. The total wall charge zpe\nand the parameters of the associated distribution of the per-\nmanent charge p\u02dcex\u0001x\u0002 are fitting parameters to be determined\nby comparison with experiment. The second term is the\nchannel contents, consisting of free \u0001mobile\u0002 charge, carried\nby ions in the pore as they move through the channel. The\nlast term is the induced \u0001i.e., polarization\u0002 charge on the pro-\ntein walls of the pore \u000334\u0004. The dielectric properties of the\nchannel protein and its water-filled pore \u0001radius a and length\nd\u0002 are described by the permittivity of free space, the \u0001dimen-\nsionless\u0002 dielectric constants of the protein \u0003p and water\n\u0003H2O, and the effective dielectric constant of the channel\n\u00038,9\u0004\n\u0003\u02dc\f\n\u0003p\n\u0003H2O\n2\u00030\na2 ln\u0001d\/a\u0002\n.\nThe constant \u0007\u02dc is the potential difference across the channel,\nand the parameter \u0003=\u00030\u0003H2O. To solve the Poisson equation\nwe write it in dimensionless form using the following char-\nacteristic length and potential:\n\u0004\u02dc = \u0004UT, x\u02dc = xd, UT =\nkBT\ne\n,\np\u02dcex = n\u02dcL\n\bpex, n\u02dcj = n\u02dcL\n\bnj . \u00016\u0002\nThe dimensionless number densities for the fixed and the\nmobile charges are introduced by normalization of p\u02dcex and n\u02dcj\nas follows:\nNf = n\u02dcL\n\bS\r\n0\nd dx\u02dc p\u02dcex\u0001x\u02dc\u0002\nn\u02dcL\n\b = n\u02dcL\n\bv0\r\n0\n1\ndx pex\u0001x\u0002 ,\nNm = n\u02dcL\n\bSef f\r\n0\nd dx\u02dc n\u02dcj\u0001x\u02dc\u0002\nn\u02dcL\n\b = n\u02dcL\n\bv0\r\n0\n1\ndx fscnj\u0001x\u0002 , \u00017\u0002\nwhere Nf and Nm are the number of elementary fixed and\nmobile charges, v0=Sd is the pore volume, S and Sef f are the\nactual and the effective cross-sectional areas for the fixed\nand the mobile ions, and fsc is the filling factor defined as\nSef f = fscS. In scaling equations \u00017\u0002 the bulk concentration on\nthe far left is used as the reference concentration.

As a first step\nwe calculate the concentrations making a linear initial guess\nfor the potential\n\u0004\u0001x;initial guess\u0002 =\n\u0001\u00041 \u2212 \u00040\u0002\n\u0001x1 \u2212 x0\u0002\n\u0001x \u2212 x0\u0002 + \u00040. \u000118\u0002\nUsing the given concentrations and electrostatic potential in\nthe bulk, we then set boundary conditions directly at the\nchannel boundaries. Next, we obtain concentrations and cur-\nrents using Eqs. \u000115\u0002\u2013\u000117\u0002. The concentrations obtained are\nused to update the value of the potential. This procedure can\nbe repeated to obtain a higher-order accuracy of the solution.\nNote that the linear part of the potential \u0004\u0001x\u0002 in Eq. \u00019\u0002, the\nGreen\u2019s function \u00019\u0002, and the two first terms in function \u00019\u0002\nare fixed and have to be calculated only once during the\niterations. This numerical procedure was used earlier by\nEisenberg \u000340\u0004. The difference in the present calculation is\nthat we solve the Poisson equation analytically and then\ncouple it to the solution of the access resistance equations\n\u0001see below\u0002.\nThe output of these calculations is the axial distributions\nof the electrostatic potential \u0004\u02dc \u0001x\u0002 and of the ions c\u02dcj\u0001x\u0002, the\ncurrent I\u02dcj for species j, and the total current I\u02dc as a function of\nthe applied voltage and the ionic concentrations in the bulk\nsolutions.\nIn Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002 we present our calculation of the resultant\ncurrent-voltage characteristic for an uncharged channel. It\ncan be seen that, in the absence of a net charge on the wall,\nthe I-V characteristic is linear. The effect of a net charge on\nthe current is analyzed in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002 where we compare the\nI-V characteristics for uncharged and charged channels. The\nnet negative wall charge used for this calculation is equal to\n\u22120.2e. It is distributed on the membrane walls using a two-\nmode Gaussian distribution with mean values \u000e j equal to 1\/6\nnear the channel mouth and 1\/2 at the center of the channel.\nThe variance is chosen as \r=0.1.

These results demonstrate that a simple calibration of\nthe analytic solution allows one to get the same result as\nyielded by the full 3D simulations.\nD. Filling factor\nWe note that the current in the I-V characteristics shown\nin Fig. 2 is calculated as I=eJ\u02dcSch, where J\u02dc is the current\ndensity obtained using the self-consistent solution of the\nPNP equations and Sch is the channel\u2019s cross-sectional area.\nWe note further that the continuous approximation intro-\nduced above is valid only on the channel axis. Away from the\nchannel axis the current density has to decay rapidly for a\nnumber of reasons. First, the ions that carry the current can-\nnot come closer then their own radii to the channel wall.\nSecond, the effective channel radius is further reduced due to\nthe presence of dielectric walls of low dielectric constant.\nIndeed, the charges induced by an ion on the dielectric walls\nforce the ion to stay near the channel axis, so that the prob-\nability of finding the ion at a finite distance r from the axis\ndecays rapidly with increasing r. Moreover, the actual geom-\netry of the channel is complicated \u0001e.g., the channel is not\ncylindrical\u0002 and the channel can only be characterized by an\neffective radius averaged over the channel length. For these\nreasons, calculation of the total current through the channel\nusing the axial current density J\u02dc requires one to introduce an\neffective cross-sectional area of the channel Sch=Sef f\n=\fa2fsc=\faef f2 \u0001see also \u000341\u0004\u0002.\nThe filling factor may have a broader physical signifi-\ncance, and it can be used to compensate for inhomogeneity\nrelated to all the space-dependent parameters of the system\nthat are being neglected in the cylindrical symmetry approxi-\nmation. We note that this factor is introduced as a simple\napproximation of the free-energy contribution due to the po-\ntential of the mean force in the channel. We note also that\nfactors of this type are common in semiconductor theories\n\u0001cf. the ideality factor in the diode equation \u000342\u0004\u0002 used to\nmodel conduction in ion channels \u000333\u0004. The adjustment of\nthe effective cross-sectional area of the channel in an ana-\nlytic 1D approximation allows one to obtain qualitatively\ngood agreement with the full 3D PNP solution of Kurnikova\net al. \u000324\u0004, whose results fit experiments. Therefore, taking\ninto account earlier examples of the successful application of\nthe 1D approximation \u0001see, e.g., \u000311\u201315\u0004\u0002 our analytic solu-\ntion can be calibrated with a suitably chosen filling factor\nand then used as a convenient tool for obtaining simple ana-\nlytic estimates of the fundamental conducting properties of\nmany ion channels.\nThe 1D approximation obtained above can be further im-\nproved by taking into account changes in the potential and\nthe ion concentrations in the bulk. The latter difference can\nbe estimated using, e.g., the Donnan potential or the access\nresistance formalism as discussed in the Introduction. In\nwhat follows we solve the problem using the access resis-\ntance formalism by coupling the PNP solution in the channel\n\u0001discussed in this section\u0002 to the analytic solution of the\nPBNP equations in the bulk \u0001next section\u0002 in a self-consistent\nmanner.\nIII.

As already mentioned, the\nsolution in bulk spans from \u0006\b to a hemisphere at each\nchannel mouth of radius equal to the effective radius of the\nchannel.\nA. Nernst-Planck equation in spherical symmetry\nConsider first a solution of the Nernst-Planck equation\n\u00012\u0002, rewrite it in spherical symmetry as\nJ\u02dcj = \u2212 Db,j\u0006dn\u02dcj\u0001r\u02dc\u0002dr\u02dc + zjekBTn\u02dcj\u0001r\u02dc\u0002d\u0004\u02dcdr\u02dc \u0007 , \u000119\u0002\nand set the following boundary conditions at infinity:\nn\u02dcj\u0001r\u02dc = \b\u0002 = n\u02dcj\n\b\n, \u0004\u02dc \u0001r\u02dc = \b\u0002 = \u0004\u02dc \b. \u000120\u0002\nAnd at the surface of the semisphere closed to the channel\nmouth\nJ\u02dcj\u0001r\u02dc = aef f\u0002 = \u0006\nI\u02dcj\n2e\faef f\n2 . \u000121\u0002\nHere, aef f is the effective radius of the channel and I\u02dcj is the\ncurrent of the jth ion found in the solution of the PNP equa-\ntions above inside the channel. The \u201c\u2212\u201d sign is for ions in the\nleft-hand bath and the \u201c+\u201d sign is for ions in the right-hand\nbath. We use the following scaling factors for the electric\npotential, the radial coordinate, and the ion concentration:\n\u0004\u02dc = \u0004UT, r\u02dc = rd, n\u02dcj = njn\u02dcL\n\b\n. \u000122\u0002\nThe dimensionless form of Eq. \u000119\u0002 can then be written as\nJj =\nJ\u02dcjd\nDb,jn\u02dcL\n\b = \u2212 \u0006dnj\u0001r\u0002dr + nj\u0001r\u02dc\u0002dzj\u0004dr \u0007 . \u000123\u0002\nIntegration of Eq. \u000119\u0002 with the boundary conditions \u000120\u0002\nand \u000121\u0002 can be performed in a way similar to integration of\nEq. \u000114\u0002, taking into account that J\u02dcj\u0001r\u02dc\u0002=\u0006 I\u02dcj \/2e\fr\u02dc2.

Note,\nhowever, that neutrality is not required at the channel mouth,\nunlike in the Donnan potential formalism \u000327\u0004. Using the\ndimensionless variables defined in Eq. \u00018\u0002, and substituting\nthe solution of the Nernst-Planck equation \u000123\u0002 into Eq. \u000127\u0002,\nwe obtain the following integrodifferential equation for\nmonovalent ion solutions:\n1\n2\n2r\nd2\ndr2\n\u0001r\u0004\u0002 = sinh\u0003\u0004\u0001r\u0002 \u2212 \u0004L\n\b\u0004\n+\n1\n2\u0005j zjnj\n\b\u0011 je\n\u2212zj\u0004\u0001r\u0002\r\nr\n\b\nezj\u0004\u0001s\u0002\ns2\nds . \u000129\u0002\nWe have assumed for simplicity that the diffusion coeffi-\ncients do not depend on r, although this simplification can be\nreadily lifted if necessary. The solution of the integrodiffer-\nential equation is not trivial. It can be solved numerically to\ndetermine the electrostatic potential. However, it was shown\nby Peskoff and Bers \u000321\u0004 that the solution found in a linear\napproximation of the PB equation agrees well with the exact\nsolution under most physiological conditions. Therefore, we\nlinearize the PB equation for small values of the electrostatic\npotential and obtain a reduced equation in the form \u000321\u0004\n1\n2\n2r\nd2\ndr2\n\u0001r\u0004\u0002 = \u0004\u0001r\u0002 \u2212 \u0004L\n\b +\n\u0011\nr\n, \u000130\u0002\nwhere \u0011= 12\u0005 jzj\u0011 j.

Note that the signs of the potential gradient and\nthe current in Eq. \u000131\u0002 are determined by the fact that the\ndirections of the radial coordinate r and the axial coordinate\nx in Eqs. \u00018\u0002 and \u000119\u0002 in the left bulk are opposite.\nSimilarly, the bulk solution for the electrostatic potential\non the right-hand side can be written by making sure that the\nsign of the current density Eq. \u000121\u0002 is properly chosen,\n\u0004\u0001r\u0002 = \u2212\n\u0001\u0011 f + S1\u0002e\n\u000e2nf\n\u0001aef f\/d\u2212r\u0002\n\u00011 + \u000e2nf\naef f\/d\u0002r\n+\n\u0011 f\nr\n+ \u0004R\n\b\n. \u000132\u0002\nwhere S1= \u0001aef f \/d\u00022\u0001\u0004PNP\u0001x1\u0002, nf = n\u02dcR\n\b \/ n\u02dcL\n\b\n, and \u0011 f\n= \u00011 \/2nf\u0002\u0005 jzj\u0011 j. The factor nf appears because we scale con-\ncentrations on both sides of the channel by the same value\nn\u02dcL\n\b\n.\nEquations \u000124\u0002, \u000131\u0002, and \u000132\u0002 provide the required solu-\ntion of the PBNP equations in the bulk. To determine spatial\ndistributions of the concentrations nj\u0001r\u0002 and the electrostatic\npotential \u0004\u0001r\u0002 \u0001and their values at the channel mouth\u0002 in a\nself-consistent manner, these equations can be solved simul-\ntaneously using an iterative procedure analogous to that in-\ntroduced in the previous section for the PNP solution.\nNote that these solutions depend on the concentrations\nand the electrostatic potential at infinity, the dimensionless\ncurrent densities \u0011 j, and the gradient of electrostatic potential\n\u0001\u0004PNP at both mouths of the channel. The latter values are\nprovided by the PNP solution in the channel. In turn the PNP\nsolution is determined by the concentrations and the electro-\nstatic potential at the channel mouth provided by the PBNP\nsolution. This feature allows one to couple the PBNP solu-\ntion in the bulk to the PNP solution in the channel in a\nself-consistent way, as described in the next sections.\nIV. LINEAR APPROXIMATION\nTo appreciate that the boundary condition problem can be\nresolved uniquely, let us consider a linear approximation of\nthe joint solutions \u00019\u0002, \u000116\u0002, \u000126\u0002, \u000131\u0002, and \u000132\u0002. We note\nthat, when both ion concentrations and fixed charge in the\nchannel are relatively small, the last term in Eqs. \u00019\u0002 can be\nneglected. In this approximation S1=S0=ref f\n2 \u0001\u0004PNP, \u0001\u0004PNP\n= \u0001\u00041\u2212\u00040\u0002 \/ \u0001x1\u2212x0\u0002, ref f =aef f \/d, and x1\u2212x0=1 in dimension-\nless coordinates.

Now, we describe the algorithm for\nsimultaneous solution of these equations in the more general\nnonlinear case.\nV. JOINT SOLUTION\nIn order to complete the calculation of ion density and\nelectrostatic potential everywhere in space, we couple the\nPNP solution in the channel and the PBNP solution in the\nbulk. The bulk concentrations and the electric potential for\nthe coupled solution are set at infinity. Near the channel\nmouth, on the surface of the hemisphere, the boundary con-\nditions are given by the continuity conditions for the electric\nfield and the current.

Repeat steps \u00012\u0002 and \u00013\u0002 in turn until conver-\ngence is reached.\nThe solution obtained in the previous section for the cur-\nrent and the potential gradient in the pore is thus used to set\nup boundary conditions for the PBNP equations in the bath.\nIn turn, solutions \u000124\u0002 and \u000131\u0002 can be used to set up the\nboundary conditions for the PNP equations in the pore. The\nconvergence of the successive approximations is guaranteed\nby the fact that, in the zeroth approximation, the current\nthrough the channel and the electric field at the channel\nmouth have maximum possible values. At the next step this\nleads to the maximum possible reduction in the concentra-\ntion and the potential at the channel mouth. In turn, this\nreduces the current and the electric field within the channel,\nwhich then leads to a smaller correction at the channel\nmouth, i.e., the scheme converges, leading to the solution\nshown in Fig. 3. Note that, in the two regions of thickness\naef f \u0001radius of the channel\u0002 on the left- and the right-hand\nsides of the channel, the gradient of the electric potential is\nassumed to be constant and equal to that in the channel. The\ncorresponding density profile for two ionic species is pre-\nsented in Fig. 4. As expected, the density profiles show a\nsignificant rise for Na+ and an abrupt decrease for Cl\u2212 inside\nthe channel. This suggests that the channel is most of the\ntime occupied by a single Na+ ion but almost zero occupancy\nof Cl\u2212 ions, on average; we confirm this later when we esti-\nmate the channel occupation number as a function of the\nmembrane fixed charge and the bulk concentration.\nAnother possible way of connecting the solution inside\nthe channel to that in the bulk would be by matching the\nsolutions asymptotically \u000333\u0004. Although in a sense more in-\nteresting from the theoretical point of view, its use here\nwould neither clarify our approach nor improve the quality\nof the fits to experimental results. It could, however, form the\nbasis of a future project building on the ideas presented in\nthe present paper.\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n\u22120.3\n\u22120.25\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.15\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.05\n0\n\u03c6\n(\nV\n)\nPB PNP PB\nx (A\u02da)\nFIG. 3.

These\nparameters include the distribution and the magnitude of the\nchannel wall\u2019s fixed charge, the ionic diffusion coefficient in\nthe bulk and inside the channel, and the filling factor de-\nscribed in Sec. II D. The fixed negative charge on the mem-\nbrane wall is taken equal to \u22120.227e. This corresponds to the\nnumber of particles inside the channel with a concentration\nof 250 mM. We stress that the projection of the distribution\nof fixed charge on the channel axis for the 1D approximation\nderived from the known 3D distribution of fixed charge has\nyet to be determined. The fixed charge is distributed along\nthe 1D channel axis using a multimodal Gaussian distribu-\ntion. With a suitable choice of these parameters, it is possible\nto fit experimental measurements for different concentra-\ntions.\nFigure 5 compares the I-V \u0001current-voltage\u0002 characteris-\ntics with experimental measurements by Oiki et al. \u000343\u0004 in a\n1 M CsCl solution. The calculated current is given by the\nblack thick line, while the experimental measurements are\ngiven by the circles. The calculated current is in good agree-\nment with the experimental measurement. The robustness of\nthis method is further tested by comparison with another set\nof experimental results presented by \u000344\u0004, as shown in Fig. 6.\nAgain, good agreement is obtained between experiment and\ntheory. Here, the \u0001I-V\u0002 characteristics in the model are cal-\nculated for a channel with \u22120.227e fixed charge distributed\nusing a three-mode Gaussian distribution.

The occupation number Ci of the channel for\neach ion species is found by integrating the corresponding\nconcentration over the channel volume. For cylindrical ge-\nometry we have\nCi = fsc\fa2\r\n0\nL\nn\u02dci\u0001x\u0002dx . \u000135\u0002\nNote the filling factor in the expression for the occupation\nnumber. In general the filling factor has to be introduced\nindividually for each ion species; however, for simplicity, we\nuse here one average filling factor.\nIn Fig. 7, the channel occupation number, the ions\u2019 MPT\nthrough the channel, and the channel current are estimated as\nfunctions of the charge on the wall as it is varied from \u22120.2e\nto +0.2e. The fixed charge is distributed on the membrane\nwall according to Eq. \u000110\u0002. In these plots, the MPT through\nthe channel is calculated as \u0012MPS\n\u0001i\u0002\n=Cie \/ Ii, where Ii is the total\ncurrent through the channel of the ion species i. Note that\nthis number corresponds to the total time one ion spends on\naverage in the channel during the transition \u0001in our example\nfrom left to right\u0002. The \u0012MPS\n\u0001i\u0002 differs from the usual mean first\npassage time by the factor Ci.\nThe calculations in Figs. 7\u20139 are carried out for concen-\ntrations in the left and the right baths of 500 and 40 mM,\nrespectively, with an externally applied voltage of 300 mV. It\ncan be seen from Fig. 7 that while the channel occupation\nnumber decreases for the cation as a function of the total\nwall charge, it increases for the anion. The conduction cur-\nrent decreases as a function of fixed charge for Na+ and\nincrease for Cl\u2212 as the fixed charge increases and becomes\npositive. Note also that the total channel occupation numbers\nvary nonlinearly as functions of the fixed charge and are\nlower than 1 in the interval considered. The mean passage\ntime shows a minimum for the anion and decreases for the\ncation as the wall charge is increased. The motion of Cl\u2212\nthrough the channel is slower than that of Na+. These depen-\ndences can be attributed to the charge affinity between the\nmoving ions and the fixed charge distributed on the mem-\nbrane wall. Estimation of the channel properties as a function\nof the channel fixed charge can be useful in gaining insight\ninto the channel selectivity to specific ions as a result of the\ninteractions between the ligand charge at the channel\u2019s bind-\ning sites and the permeant ions.

Dependence on the bulk concentrations\nFigure 8 plots the channel occupation number, the ionic\nmean passage time, and the ionic current in the channel as\nfunctions of bulk concentration in the left-hand bath for an\napplied voltage of 300 mV. The concentration in the right-\nhand bath was kept constant at 40 mM. The channel occupa-\ntion number increases linearly with the bulk concentration.\nThe same variations are observed for the cation currents in\nFig. 8\u0001c\u0002. As the bulk concentration increases, the Cl\u2212 current\nremain constant. This may be attributed to charge repulsion\nbetween the negatively charged protein \u0001\u22120.227e\u0002 and the\nanion. We have ensured that the concentration changes inves-\ntigated remain within the physiological range.\nFigure 9 calculates the channel conductance as a function\nof the wall charge and the bulk concentration. It is found that\nchannel conductance decays as the wall charge increase,\nwhereas it increases as the bulk concentration increases.\nC. Diffusion-limited ion flow in the vicinities of the pore\nentrance\nThe AR as described by Hall \u000318\u0004, RHall=\n\u0013\n4a , is used as the\nreference for our calculation. Here, a is the channel radius\nand \u0013 is the resistivity of the solution. This corresponds to\nthe resistance of the hemisphere close to the channel mouth,\nwhich is of the same order as the one of the remaining infi-\nnite sphere in the case of an uncharged membrane. The con-\nductivity of the electrolyte is expressed as the weighted sum\nof the equivalent conductivities \u0014i and given by \u0013\u22121\n=\u0005zic\u02dci\u0014i \u000347\u0004. The equivalent conductivities at 25 \u00b0C are\napproximated by \u0014i=\u0014i\n0 \/ \u00011+Gi\u000eIM\u0002, which characterizes the\nconcentration well and remains reasonably accurate at con-\ncentrations near 1 mol\/l. The quantity IM =\n1\n2\u0005izi\n2c\u02dci is the ionic\nstrength \u0001molar basis\u0002. The quantity \u0014i\n0 which is the equiva-\nlent conductivity of an ionic species at infinite dilution and\nthe empirical coefficients Gi are described by \u000348\u0004 and given\nin Table I.\nWe have estimated the AR to the channel by considering\nthe existence of voltage drops along the left and the right\nmouths of the channel given, respectively, by \u0004\u02dc L=\u0004\u02dc \u0001x\u02dc0\u0002\n\u2212\u0004\u02dc L\n\b and \u0004\u02dc R=\u0004\u02dc R\n\b\n\u2212\u0004\u02dc \u0001x\u02dc1\u0002. The access resistances in the left-\nand the right-hand mouths are given, respectively, by RL\n=\u0004\u02dc L \/ I\u02dcch and RR=\u0004\u02dc R \/ I\u02dcch, where I\u02dcch is the total current\nthrough the channel. The total AR to the channel is calcu-\nlated as RT= \u0010RL+RR\u0010. We study diffusion-limited ion flow in\nthe vicinities of the pore entrance. The AR to the channel as\na function of the bulk concentration in the left bath is calcu-\nlated for uncharged and charged channels as shown in Fig.\n10. Our estimated ARs for uncharged and charged channels\nremain below the AR estimated using the Hall formula. The\nfixed charge is distributed on the channel surface and mainly\nconcentrated at the channel center, corresponding to a\ncharged membrane with binding site at its center. In the pres-\nence of the fixed charge on the membrane surface, the AR to\nthe channel decreases as the concentration increases, leading\nto flows much larger than the diffusion of ions for an un-\ncharged channel. At higher concentration, the AR of the\ncharged channel is smaller than that of an uncharged chan-\nnel. High current flow in the presence of fixed charge on the\nmembrane wall may result in the current saturation observed\nat high concentration.\nVII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe have introduced a self-consistent analytic approach\nfor the calculation of the ion current through a channel and\nthe access resistance at the channel mouth as a function of\nthe applied potential and the bulk concentrations. In this ap-\nproach the PNP solution in the channel is coupled to the\nPBNP solution in the bulk by matching the corresponding\nboundary conditions at the channel mouth in a self-consistent\nway and by introducing the \u201cfilling factor\u201d as an additional\nfitting parameter that takes into account the radial distribu-\ntion of current density in the channel. We note that this factor\nis introduced as a simple approximation of the free-energy\ncontribution due to the potential of the mean force in the\nchannel. We note also that factors of this type are common in\nsemiconductor theories \u0001cf. the ideality factor in the diode\nequation \u000342\u0004\u0002 that are used to model conduction in ion chan-\nTABLE I.

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 80, 021925 \u00012009\u0002\n021925-10\nnels \u000333\u0004. The method allows for the calculation of the cur-\nrents for an arbitrary number of monovalent ion species that\nhave different diffusion constants in the channel and in the\nbulk. It is applied to fit experimental I-V characteristics of\nthe Gramicidin A channel for various concentrations, yield-\ning good quantitative agreement with the experimental re-\nsults.\nIt is further shown that the changes in experimental I-V\ncharacteristics as a function of bulk concentrations can be\nsuccessfully reproduced by the method. The corresponding\nchanges in the filling factor can be attributed to the effect of\nsaturation \u000349\u0004.\nGiven that the 1D PNP solution was earlier applied suc-\ncessfully to the analysis of experimental I-V characteristics\nin many ion channels \u000311\u201315\u0004, the scope of the present study\nalso goes beyond the Gramicidin channel. In particular, with\na subtle transformation of the channel structure, the work\ncould be extended to other types of ion channel such as the\nL-type Ca2+ and Na+ channels. This implies adjustment of\nthe concentrations and the fixed charge on the channel wall.\nBecause the filling factor allows for the ionic radius to be\ntaken into account, it can be introduced for each ion species\nseparately and the results obtained can also be used to gain\nfurther insight into the ion channel selectivity mechanisms\nthat distinguish between alike ions.\nDuring the preparation of this paper, another interesting\nanalytical approximation of the solution of the PNP equa-\ntions appeared in press \u000333\u0004. In this approximation, which\nfollows closely known asymptotic techniques of semicon-\nductor physics \u000350\u0004, matching of the solution and the bound-\nary layers at the channel entrances is not required. However,\nthe resultant analytical solution is discontinuous at the chan-\nnel boundaries and for this reason is not well suited to the\nestimation of the access resistance discussed in the present\npaper. Besides, the approximation relies on charge neutrality,\nwhich was shown earlier to be a less accurate approximation\nto the numerical solution of the PNP in the bulk \u000321\u0004 than the\nlinear approximation adopted here. The results \u000333\u0004 obtained\nfor the constant charge density on the channel walls are not\ncompared with experimental data. It will, however, be of\ninterest to compare the two analytical approximations in the\nfuture.\nThe approach we have introduced can be further im-\nproved in a number of ways. First, the boundary conditions\ncan be improved using, e.g., the theoretical discussion in\n\u000322,51\u0004. More importantly, the approach opens the possibility\nof an analytical treatment of the subtle details of the potential\nof the mean force revealed through molecular-dynamics\nsimulations \u0001see, e.g., \u000330\u0004\u0002 but at the level of continuous\nPNP approximation. In particular, extending the idea of the\nfilling factor, and including explicitly the PMF due to the\nwall vibrations and ion-wall interaction, will lead to a time-\ndependent Nernst-Planck equation with \u0005\u02dc j\nPMF specific for\neach ion species, thereby opening up the possibility of ana-\nlytic insight into the selectivity of ion channels between alike\nions. A model using density-functional theory \u000352\u0004 to take\ncare of finite-size effects could also be used to patch the bulk\nsolution.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work was supported by the Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council \u0001U.K.\u0002, the Russian Foundation\nfor Fundamental Science, INTAS, and ESF.\n\u00031\u0004 B.
