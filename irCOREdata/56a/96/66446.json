[DOI: 10.1063\/1.1821649]\nIt has become increasingly important to find alternatives\nto current data storage technologies in order to meet the de-\nmands for increasing storage capacity. With this aim in mind,\nthere is at present a large effort involved in finding suitable\nmethods for fabricating large area arrays of densely packed,\nisolated magnetic elements. Such arrays can provide a way\nto achieve higher areal densities with conventional magnetic\nrecording media1\u20133 and are also of interest for use as high\ndensity magnetic random access memory cells.4 In addition,\narrays of small ferromagnetic elements provide model sys-\ntems for magnetic investigations, allowing for example the\nstudy of magnetic spin structures, stray field interactions,\nshape anisotropy, and magnetic switching at the nanoscale.\nIn the present work, we have fabricated nanoscale nickel dot\narrays down to periods of 71 nm using x-ray interference\nlithography (XIL) in combination with electrodeposition. In\naddition we have studied the magnetic behavior of the dot\narrays, investigating the magnetic switching with magneto-\noptical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements and carrying out\nmagnetic imaging using photoemission electron microscopy\n(PEEM). An insight into the observed behavior was obtained\nusing micromagnetic simulations.\nFirst we take a closer look at XIL and show that it has\nseveral advantages over other methods available for fabricat-\ning magnetic dot arrays. XIL employs extreme-ultraviolet\n(EUV) light passing through a grating mask to form multiple\nbeams and the resulting interference pattern is exposed in a\npolymer resist to produce nanoscale periodic structures.5,6 It\nis envisaged that with this method, future development of the\nx-ray masks will allow us to fabricate dot arrays with periods\nwell below 50 nm. A similar interference technique has been\nemployed to manufacture magnetic nanostructures with laser\nradiation,7 but the longer laser wavelength, 193 nm com-\npared with 13 nm for EUV light, gives a lower limit to the\nperiod of about 100 nm. Compared with electron-beam li-\nthography there is practically no proximity-effect, facilitating\nthe fabrication of dense structures, and the throughput is\nhigher because it is a parallel exposure process. Self-\nassembly methods for fabricating arrays of magnetic dots or\nparticles8\u201310 do not have the specific control of the array\ngeometry achievable with XIL, often requiring templates to\nachieve long-range ordering. While magnetic particles with\nsizes of a few nanometers can be fabricated and assembled,10\nXIL has the benefit of being able to pattern any material that\ncan be deposited as a thin film. Focused-ion beam lithogra-\nphy has been used to produce periods down to 56 nm, and\nwriting and reading to the magnetic islands has been\ndemonstrated.11 However, like electron-beam lithography\nthis is a slow serial patterning method and ion beam damage\nto the edges of the magnetic element may become critical as\nthe lateral dimensions of the magnetic elements decrease. In\ncomparison with nanoimprint lithography,1 XIL has the ad-\nvantage that it is a noncontact lithography, so that surface\nparticle contamination is not critical and there is no mechani-\ncal stress applied to the substrate.\nTo fabricate the nickel dot arrays, we used substrates\nconsisting of 50-nm-thick polymethylmethacrylate resist\n(molecular weight 600 kg\/mol), spin-coated onto an oxi-\ndized silicon wafer with a Cr 30 nm\/Ge 10 nm sputtered\nseed layer for electrodeposition.12 Square arrays of holes\nwere patterned in the resist at the XIL beamline, Swiss Light\nSource using an XIL mask consisting of Si3N4\/Cr gratings\non a silicon nitride membrane fabricated using electron beam\nlithography.5 The hole arrays have periods, p, of 113, 99, 85,a)Electronic mail: laura.heyderman@psi.ch\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS VOLUME 85, NUMBER 21 22 NOVEMBER 2004\n0003-6951\/2004\/85(21)\/4989\/3\/$22.00 \u00a9 2004 American Institute of Physics4989\nDownloaded 21 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66.

Dot diameters, d, ranging from 40 to 90 nm were\nachieved by varying the x-ray dose with exposure times\nranging between 5 and 35 s depending on the geometry of\nthe grating in the XIL mask. The holes created by XIL are\nfilled with nickel by electrodeposition in a nickel sulphamate\nbath at a temperature of 50 \u00b0C. Typical nickel dot arrays are\nshown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). Detailed inspection using a\nhigh resolution SEM of an 80 mm square array of dots with\np=71 nm [Fig. 1(c)] showed, despite edge irregularities, a\nuniform dot diameter of d= s44\u00b11.5d nm over the central\n40 mm square area. The height of the dots was measured\nusing an atomic force microscope to be h= s16\u00b11.5d nm.\nThere are changes in the dot size toward the array boundaries\ndue to x-ray diffraction effects which can be removed by\nsuitable masking of the interference pattern during exposure.\nHysteresis loop measurements of the dot arrays were\ncarried out using a high sensitivity MOKE.13,14 Here the av-\nerage switching behavior of the dots under the laser spot, an\nelliptical area with short axis length of 5 mm, is measured\nand magnetic fields of up to 400 Oe, oriented parallel to the\narray edge as shown in Fig. 1, were applied. The uniformity\nof the arrays was confirmed by MOKE measurements carried\nout at several positions across the array. For example, for the\narray in Fig. 1(c) the hysteresis loops measured across the\n30 mm central region of the array were almost identical, with\nconstant remanent magnetization and only a small decrease\nin the switching field from 65 Oe at the center to 60 Oe at\nthe edge.\nThe switching behavior as a function of dot separation\nwas investigated for dot arrays with h=16 nm and four dif-\nferent dot sizes, d=44, 50, 61, and 66 nm [Fig. 2(a)]. The\nremanence of the loops is relatively high, with MR \/MS close\nto 1, indicating a preference for in-plane magnetization. At\nlarge separations, greater than about 50 nm, double switch-\ning in the hysteresis loop is observed indicating switching\nvia the vortex state shown schematically with a typical hys-\nteresis loop in Fig. 2(b).15,16 Here the vortex is nucleated at\nthe edge of the dot at the nucleation field, Hn, and annihi-\nlates, again at the dot edge, at the annihilation field, Ha. As\nthe dot separation decreases, there is a change to single\nswitching indicating collective rotation of the magnetic spins\nduring magnetization reversal, as shown schematically with\na typical hysteresis loop in Fig. 2(c). It appears that the\nsingle switching has been stabilized by magnetic stray field\ninteractions between the dots. In general, the stray field in-\nteractions increase as the ratio of dot separation to dot diam-\neter decreases. In addition, switching into the vortex state\nbecomes more favorable as the dot size increases. The com-\nbination of the effect of interdot stray field interactions and\ndot size results in the transition from double (vortex) to\nsingle (collective) switching at a dot separation between 40\nand 60 nm, indicated by the shaded area in Fig. 2(a).\nIn order to visualize the effect of the magnetic stray field\ninteractions, we carried out micromagnetic simulations. The\nsimulations were performed using the OOMMF package\n(http:\/\/math.nist.gov\/oommf\/) with d=50 nm, h=16 nm, and\na simulation cell size of 2 nm. The saturation moment, MS,\nof our nickel films was measured with a vibrating sample\nmagnetometer to be 2603103 A\/m. This is lower than the\nvalue of 4853103 A\/m for pure nickel which is likely to be\na result of the codeposition of impurities into the films dur-\ning electrodeposition.7 In order to obtain nucleation of a vor-\ntex in a single dot (inset in Fig. 3), the exchange constant, A,\nwas reduced to a value of 5.5310\u221213 J \/m, which is almost\n20 times smaller than that for pure nickel. This reduction in\nthe exchange constant is again likely to be a result of impu-\nrities introduced during electrodeposition which reduce the\nFIG. 1.

It should also be noted that\ndefects in the nickel dots, both at the surface [e.g., edge\ndefects seen in Fig. 1(c)] and in the volume, will pin mag-\nnetic spins and favor vortex nucleation17 so that it is likely\nthat the reduced exchanged constant required for the simula-\ntion is smaller than the actual value for the electroplated\nnickel system. The low A and MS could also explain the\ngradual annihilation of the vortex, which appears as the\ngradual slope before Hn as seen in Fig. 2(b), rather than the\nsharp jump in the hysteresis curve seen in Refs. 15 and 16.\nThe magnetic switching in a 333 array of 50 nm dots was\nthen simulated and a snapshot of the simulation is shown in\nFig. 3. The stray field interaction between the dots favors the\ncollective rotation of the magnetic spins because, rather than\nforming a vortex in each individual dot (Fig. 3 inset), the flux\nclosure can occur through a series of dots to minimize the\nmagnetostatic energy.\nWe observed further evidence of the stray field interac-\ntions in PEEM magnetic images of the nickel dot arrays. The\nimaging was carried out on nickel dot arrays with\nh=40 nm, dot sizes d=95, 78, and 65 nm and almost con-\nstant dot separation, s=18, 21, and 20 nm, respectively, at\nthe SIM beamline,18 Swiss Light Source with an Elmitec\nPEEM. The arrays were demagnetized by rotating the sample\nabout an in-plane axis in a dc magnetic field, while reducing\nthe field from 3000 Oe down to zero and, employing x-ray\nmagnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), the magnetic domains\nwere imaged by tuning the x-ray energy to the Ni L3 edge.\nDividing two images taken with left and right circular polar-\nized light leads to an XMCD image where the intensity is a\nmeasure of the angle between the magnetization and the cir-\ncular x-ray polarization vector, which we refer to as the mag-\nnetization sensitivity direction.19 Therefore ferromagnetic\ndomains with magnetization parallel or antiparallel to the\npolarization vector appear black or white in the XMCD im-\nage and domains with magnetization perpendicular to the\npolarization vector will have an intermediate grey contrast.\nWhile the dot separation is below the resolution of the\nPEEM any ordering of the magnetic spins can be observed in\nthe XMCD image, and horizontally running bands of con-\ntrast are seen (see Fig. 4). The bands are about two dots wide\nas seen in the expanded section in Fig. 4, where for compari-\nson a schematic of the dot array is overlayed. The direction-\nality can be explained by the interdot stray field interactions\nresulting in chains of coupled dots; either single domain dots\nas seen in the micromagnetic simulation in Fig. 3 or single\ndomain dots interspersed with chains of vortices as the dot\ndiameter and height increases.16 The fact that this ordering is\npreferentially horizontal rather than vertical may be due to\nslight asymmetry in the dot array geometry or because the\ndemagnetizing field, HD, is experimentally not exactly along\nthe array diagonal.\nIn conclusion, we have employed XIL to fabricate\nnanoscale magnetic dot arrays with periods down to 71 nm\nand uniform over 40 mm, and have observed the effect of\nstray field interactions on their magnetic behavior. Using\nXIL it should be possible to produce arrays with areas reach-\ning over several millimeters and even larger areas can be\nenvisaged with implementation of a stepper and multiple ex-\nposures. The theoretical minimum period achievable is half\nthe radiation wavelength. We employ an EUV wavelength of\n13 nm resulting in a theoretical minimum period of 6.5 nm,\nsuitable for future high density magnetic storage media and\ndevices. Thus the potential of XIL for high resolution and\nhigh throughput fabrication of nanoscale magnetic dot arrays\nwill prove to be important for both fundamental scientific\nresearch and industrial development, providing essential in-\nformation about magnetic switching and stray field interac-\ntions at the nanoscale.\nThe authors would like to thank Fredy Glaus, Andrew\nPodlesnyak, Roger Bischofberger, Konrad Vogelsang, and\nMichael Horisberger for their support with sample fabrica-\ntion and measurement.

PEEM image showing bands of contrast in a nickel dot array with\nd=95 nm, s=18 nm, and h=40 nm. The direction of the demagnetizing\nfield, HD, which is the same as the magnetization sensitivity direction, is\nindicated by the double-headed arrow. The contour plot is the Fourier trans-\nform of the image, confirming the directionality. The expanded section of\nthe image is overlayed with a schematic of the dot array for comparison,\nshowing that the bands are about two dots wide.\nAppl. Phys.
