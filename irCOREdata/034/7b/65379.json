Such \u201ebrownfields\u201f (i.e. \u201cany land that 3 \nhas previously been used or developed and is not currently fully in use and may be vacant, 4 \nderelict or contaminated\u201d (Alker et al., 2000, p. ...)) are frequently associated with deprived or 5 \ndeclining neighbourhoods, high unemployment, environmental degradation and neglect (Grimski 6 \nand Ferber, 2001). Recognition of the loss of green fields to urban sprawl, a need to promote 7 \nsustainable land use and fears over human and environmental health risks at brownfield sites has 8 \nprompted many European governments to drive land regeneration through incentives and 9 \ntaxation. The regeneration of brownfield land is regarded as a major tool in achieving sustainable 10 \ndevelopment (Grimski and Ferber, 2001) 11 \nThe UK government has placed strong emphasis on integrated land use policies including 12 \nbrownfield land regeneration in support of urban renaissance and quality of urban living (Anon., 13 \n2005a). According to the Urban White Paper (DETR, 2000) new urban developments should 14 \nhave greenspaces that are accessible to their communities, preferably by forms of transport other 15 \nthan the car. This objective is expanded in the UK by Natural England\u201fs \u201eAccess to Natural 16 \nGreenspace Standards (ANGst)\u201f that recommend that people living in towns and cities should 17 \nhave accessible natural greenspace less than 300 metres from home (English Nature, 2006). Just 18 \nas important as access, however, are planning, design and management. There is an ever growing 19 \nbody of evidence to demonstrate that greenspaces offer lasting economic, social, cultural and 20 \nenvironmental benefits - if quality is maintained (NAO, 2006). Shabby, badly maintained public 21 \nspaces lend a sense of physical and social decline (CABE Space, undated). 22 \nThe multi-functional role of urban greenspaces consolidates the case for their re-23 \nestablishment (van Leeuwan et al., 2002). The environmental and recreational functions of 24 \ngreenspaces include the sequestration of atmospheric pollutants, energy conservation through 25 \n (2) \ncooling and shading, storm water attenuation, habitat provision, and a place to relax, exercise and 26 \nsocialise (Moffat and Hutchings, 2007). The economic benefits of greenspaces, though hard to 27 \nquantify, include improved surrounding land values leading to recognition of brownfield greening 28 \nas a pump-primer to regional economic revitalisation (Grimski and Ferber, 2001).  29 \nGood practice published in support of successful regeneration (e.g., DoE, 1996) is 30 \nunderused, resulting in examples of greenspace establishment projects with questionable success, 31 \nwith respect to sustainable regeneration and the functions the greenspaces were designed to fulfil 32 \n(Sellers et al., 2006). For example, successfully improving accessibility for local communities at 33 \nthe expense of important species that have colonised the site equates to environmental 34 \ndegradation and contravention of sustainability principles (Anon., 2005b). Consequently, the 35 \nterms \u201esuccess\u201f and \u201esustainability\u201f in the context of brownfield greening projects are not 36 \nautomatically interchangeable. 37 \nFollowing decades of declining investment in public open green spaces, calls have 38 \nemerged for increased investment, quality standards and regional strategies for urban greenspace 39 \n(NAO, 2006), to raise the profile and quality of greenspaces. Understanding what makes a 40 \nsuccessful greenspace is important to securing revenue funding and ensuring that the space can 41 \ndeliver the anticipated social, environmental and economic benefits (CABE Space, 2005).  42 \nThe aims of this paper are to: A) review the literature to consider the definition of success in 43 \nthe context of brownfield greening and elucidate principles important in success evaluation, B) 44 \npropose the \u201elogic\u201f model for the evaluation of success, and C) use a case study approach to 45 \ndemonstrate the utility of the logic model within the context of a selection of social and 46 \nenvironmental criteria.  47 \n 48 \n (3) \nA Review 49 \nDefinitions of success 50 \nIn brownfield regeneration, success has been described generically as economic benefit 51 \n(De Sousa, 2003), or as civil infrastructure renewal, tax-based development, economic 52 \ndevelopment and neighbourhood revitalisation (Amekudzi and Fomunung, 2004). In specific 53 \nterms, success has been described as local community involvement, job creation, or relative to 54 \nenvironmental remediation (Amekudzi and Fomunung, 2004). Reviewing the literature, 55 \nSilverthorne (2006) noted that definitions of success varied between countries, academic 56 \ndisciplines and regeneration projects, recognising that different concepts of success emerged from 57 \nthe attachment of different values. The lack of definitive criteria against which success may be 58 \nmeasured can result in a lack of motivation to improve standards (Silverthorne, 2006).  59 \n 60 \nTraditional approaches to success measurement 61 \nDictionary definitions of success emphasize it as a product, gain of a desired state, 62 \nachievement or conclusion. Thus, success can be thought of as attaining something sought after. 63 \nIn the context of brownfield greening, success is often demonstrated against aims\/objectives. This 64 \ndefinition is reflected in traditional developer-, funding body- and site owner\/manager-centric 65 \nnotions of success where the focus of evaluation is exclusively economic (Wedding and 66 \nCrawford-Brown, 2007). Three reasons explain the persistence of this definition: 67 \ni) economic factors of success justify project expense; 68 \nii) success can be described in project management terms, which are relatively simple to 69 \nmeasure (e.g. project deliverables) and data may be collected as part of the delivery 70 \nprogramme at little or no extra cost; 71 \niii) project inputs and outputs tend to be easy to describe quantitatively. 72 \n (4) \nHowever, such measures can imply that once success is achieved, continued investment in 73 \nmanagement, maintenance and development is not required; irrespective that the measures may 74 \nbear little relevance to local community needs or site sustainability and that an on-going revenue 75 \nstream is paramount to prevent disrepair and neglect (CABE Space, 2005; Sellers et al., 2006). 76 \nAcross the UK, brownfield greening is almost exclusively undertaken by government 77 \ndepartments (such as the Forestry Commission), regional bodies (such as the Regional 78 \nDevelopment Agencies) and Local Authorities, often in partnership with private companies. 79 \nExceptions include mineral extraction and landfill site restorations and aftercare strategies. This 80 \nis primarily because regeneration costs force a financially rewarding hard-end use. However, 81 \nwhilst the costs are relatively easy to identify and calculate, the economic benefits of greenspaces 82 \nare harder to quantify (Morancho, 2003; Moffat and Hutchings, 2007). Benefit versus cost 83 \npresents a problematic measure of success because each must be identified, described and 84 \ncompared in order to evaluate the level of success attained. 85 \n 86 \nSustainability appraisal of success 87 \nSustainability has been defined as the integration of social, economic and environmental 88 \nconsiderations. However, when it comes to its application, the central concept of sustainability 89 \nremains somewhat elusive and its relevance and application are tainted by the complexity of the 90 \nreal world (Moffat and Hutchings, 2007). In the context of urban greenspace, sustainability has 91 \nbeen taken to include effectiveness of pollution control measures, longevity of planted vegetation 92 \nor public utilisation of the greenspace (Moffat and Hutchings, 2007). From an environmental 93 \nperspective, success may be considered with respect to the conservation of ecological interests 94 \n(Harrison and Davies, 2002). Relating to economic sustainability, success evaluation may 95 \nconsider the benefits of regeneration as opposed to the cost of doing nothing; and from a socio-96 \n (5) \nenvironmental perspective, how people visit the greenspace (e.g., car, foot or bike), impacts on 97 \nthe site\u201fs environmental sustainability.  98 \nEach aim and objective of a regeneration project can be ascribed to one or more stakeholder 99 \ngroups (for a list of brownfield greening stakeholders see Alker et al. (2000) and Doick et al. 100 \n(2009)). A flaw of traditional funder- or developer-centric approaches to defining success is the 101 \nrestricted representation of the stakeholders. Undoubtedly, greenspace establishment is about 102 \ncommunity development. The justification may be economic regeneration and the medium of 103 \nchange may be the environment but the vector of change is society. As Selman (1997, ...) states: 104 \n\u201csustainability, biodiversity, appearance, accessibility and environmental impact of greenspaces 105 \nare clearly matters of public concern\u201d. Developer-centric notions of success fail to correlate (or 106 \ninversely correlate) with the social and economic well-being of the surrounding communities and 107 \nstakeholders such as environmental bodies (Silverthorne, 2006). Although including stakeholders 108 \nin success evaluation may create conflicts of interest (Kitchen et al., 2002), it may also encourage 109 \nan integrated appraisal, with long-term perspective on regeneration. 110 \n 111 \nLogic: a model for measuring success 112 \nLearning from traditional approaches, evaluation should be practical and appropriate. 113 \nSustainability evaluation demands economic, environmental and social criteria and integration of 114 \ndifferent stakeholders\u201f values. Furthermore, short-, medium- and long-term monitoring 115 \nperspectives are required to evaluate continuing success and to respond to changes in demand. A 116 \nmodel is required that integrates traditional and sustainability principles in the evaluation of 117 \nbrownfield greening projects. 118 \nThe \u201elogic model\u201f was developed in the 1970s by Joseph Wholey as a general framework 119 \nfor describing work in organizations; it categorises work as inputs, processes, outputs and 120 \noutcomes to represent the logical flow from one step to the next (Millar et al., 2001). Logic 121 \n (6) \nmodelling has been applied to program and strategic planning, childhood development and 122 \nproject performance evaluate in relation to different stakeholders (Millar et al., 2001). An input is 123 \na resource, investment or commitment into a project; a process is a programme or activity by 124 \nwhich an output is delivered; an output is a product or service delivered directly by or through a 125 \nproject; and, an outcome is a consequence of a project (an indirect output). Figure 1 presents a 126 \nlogic root model diagram for brownfield greening projects and a variety of greenspace aims and 127 \nobjectives as inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes for a number of example stakeholders. 128 \nLogic models highlight the synergy between difference stakeholders\u201f project aspirations. 129 \n 130 \nInsert Fig. 1 about here 131 \n 132 \nOutputs, directly attributable to a project partnership or influence and are typically 133 \nstraightforward to measure. On the contrary, project outcomes are susceptible to influences 134 \nexternal to a project. Thus, it can be hard to apportion with certainty the influence of a project on 135 \nan outcome. Outcome measurement may also be problematic as resource demand is greater than 136 \nfor output monitoring. Moreover, there is often a lag between the project\u201fs delivery and outcome 137 \nrealisation.  138 \nRegeneration project evaluations have tended to focus on inputs and outputs, not 139 \noutcomes (DETR, 1999; Wedding and Crawford-Brown, 2007). However, brownfield 140 \nregeneration and greenspace establishment project aims are frequently outcome-based (e.g., 141 \nimprove health and well-being in local communities). Inputs and outputs evaluate the project\u201fs 142 \ncontribution to achieving the outcome but do not demonstrate that the desired outcome has been 143 \nattained. Thus, outcome evaluation becomes unavoidable in any meaningful evaluation of site 144 \nsuccess and sustainability. A summary of documented impacts of greenspace establishment that 145 \n (7) \nmay be employed in the identification of \u201eoutcomes\u201f and, thus, success assessment criteria is 146 \npresented in Table 1.  147 \n 148 \nInsert Table 1: Impacts of greenspace establishment from regenerated brownfield land used in 149 \nthe identification of evaluation criteria of a successful greenspace. 150 \n 151 \nThe input-process-output-outcome categorisation within the logic model can also be used to 152 \ndirect and facilitate monitoring (i.e. what to monitor, when and how). \u201eMonitoring\u201f is defined 153 \nherein as observation and recording of a variable, either qualitatively or quantitatively, to assess 154 \nperformance or progression to a target. \u201eEvaluation\u201f goes further by assessing impact against a 155 \nscheme\u201fs objectives and testing that those objectives remain valid. 156 \n 157 \nApplication of the logic model to brownfield greening success evaluation: a case study approach 158 \nThe following sections provide an example of how the logic model was applied within the 159 \ncontext of six brownfield regeneration case studies to assess success with respect to outcomes and 160 \nquality attained.  161 \n 162 \nMethodology 163 \nSix UK case study sites were examined in order to investigate a number of brownfield 164 \ngreening project success criteria. The sites studied were: Bow Creek Ecology Park, East London 165 \n(BC); Eastbrookend Country Park, London (EBE); Ibstocks, St Helens (IBS); Ingrebourne Hill 166 \ncommunity woodland, Essex (IH); Russia Dock Park, London (RD) and Thames Barrier Park, 167 \nLondon (TBP). The case studies, introduced in Table 2, bear similarities in their land-use 168 \nhistories but varied in the extent and methodology of regeneration employed. For each project, 169 \nrelevant background information was compiled including land use and reclamation history, site 170 \nmanagement plans and project aims. The sites were investigated in 2005 and included walkovers, 171 \n (8) \nenvironmental media analysis and visitor surveys. Analytical data were collected using standard 172 \nfield and laboratory protocols (Table 3). 173 \n 174 \nInsert Table 2: The six case study sites 175 \nInsert Table 3: Methods of data collection and laboratory analysis 176 \n 177 \nEach study site was divided into zones based on spatial and historical land-use 178 \ndifferences. For vegetation and soil sampling, 5 sub-sites were randomly selected within each 179 \nzone and the media bulked to provide a single, representative sample (unless otherwise stated, 180 \nTable 3). The number of zones ranged from 14 at Russia Dock to 22 at Eastbrookend. 181 \nFormal project documentation and reclamation specifications were not available for all sites 182 \nbecause of time lapse since restoration. Therefore, a comprehensive list of site aims and 183 \nobjectives for each case could not be compiled. However, interviews with site managers and 184 \nperusal of historical documentation and management plans elucidated many of the original and 185 \ncontemporary site aims. Aims and objectives common to all sites were: 186 \n regenerate land to a soft-end use for public use, 187 \n provide access to attractive setting, 188 \n increase use of the site for sport, amenity or recreational activities, 189 \n involve community in design and management of site, 190 \n create new habitats, 191 \n maintain and enhance biodiversity.  192 \nEach site also had context-specific aims and objectives and some examples include: providing 193 \nan educational resource (BC, EBE, TBP), and promoting surrounding land and house prices 194 \n(TBP, IBS). Applying the logic model to the case study sites presents a summary of inputs, 195 \nprocesses, outputs and outcomes related to the common objectives (Figure 1). The outcomes 196 \n (9) \nconsidered by this research were establishment of trees\/woodland and provision of quality 197 \ngreenspace with social and amenity value. Analysis drew on comparisons between the case-198 \nstudies to evaluate to what extent outcomes and success had been achieved. 199 \n 200 \nResults 201 \nSubstrate for the establishment of healthy trees\/woodland 202 \nBrownfield sites are exemplified by site variability and instability, soil infertility and site 203 \nhazards (Moffat and McNeill, 1994). Consequently, risk assessment, remediation and landscape 204 \ndesign are priority regeneration tasks. However, tasks that promote healthy vegetation 205 \nestablishment are often de-prioritised due to cost implications. For example, recognising that 206 \nvegetation has both a preference and a tolerance range to growth, a variety of soil-forming 207 \nmaterials at the outer bounds of the tolerance limit are used in brownfield greening without 208 \namelioration or amendment. Tolerance ranges can be used both pre-reclamation in species 209 \nselection and post reclamation to see how conditions are changing. 210 \nSoil pH at the six case study sites was typically in the range 6.8-7.8, but extremes were 211 \nobserved (pH<3 at Ingrebourne Hill; pH>8 at Russia Dock and Bow Creek). The optimum range 212 \nfor most tree species is pH 5.0-7.5 (Bending et al., 1999). Thus, species selection must be 213 \nappropriate to ensure establishment and health. In this context, species selection at each site was 214 \nappropriate. Species tolerant of brownfield land conditions including rowan (Sorbus aucuparia 215 \n(L.)), field maple (Acer campestre (L.)) and hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna (Jacq.)) and pioneer 216 \nspecies such as silver birch (Betula pendula (Roth.)) and common alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) 217 \nGaertn.) were used at the majority of the case study sites. Extremes in pH have the potential to 218 \ninfluence various woodland establishment success measures such as localised tree loss (as seen at 219 \nIH) and poor growth rate. Regarding success for woodland establishment according to species 220 \nsuitability to soil pH, all case studies were successful.  221 \n (10) \nSoil chemical quality was assessed using total and calcium chloride extractable 222 \nconcentrations (CaCl2-extractions representing the mildly extractable or \u201ebioavailable\u201f fraction 223 \n(Landrum, 1989)) for various metals, metalloids and nutrient concentrations. Tolerance levels of 224 \nmetal\/metalloid total soil concentration vary between plant species and individuals, growing 225 \nmedium and condition, so conservative literature values were used (Table 4). Two case study 226 \nsites displayed localised exceedences relative to published background concentrations for total 227 \narsenic and zinc concentrations (Table 4); however, these values did not exceed the tolerance 228 \nvalues reported by Dickinson (2000) as suitable for tree planting. Total copper, nickel, cadmium, 229 \nchromium and cobalt soil concentrations were within background ranges (Table 4). Boron, lead 230 \nand barium tolerance values were exceeded at 3, 1, and 1 sites, respectively. However, these 231 \nexceedences were localised and mean values per site zone were less than the published tolerance 232 \nvalues and, although tolerance values are conservative to take account of species and site 233 \nvariability, the broadly acceptable metal\/metalloid total soil concentrations across the case studies 234 \nnevertheless represent success in terms of contamination abatement. Observed values for 235 \navailable concentrations and uptake (recorded as leaf concentration) enable a site specific 236 \nprognosis of vegetation establishment success. In the following sections, available 237 \nmetal\/metalloid is discussed with respect to observed leaf concentrations and field notes to 238 \nelucidate causes of poor tree health and growth. 239 \n 240 \nInsert Table 4. Ranges of total soil concentrations recorded at the case study sites and the 241 \nliterature values used for comparison. 242 \n 243 \nAll sites displayed widespread deficiency of available potassium, phosphorus and 244 \nmagnesium. For example, at Thames Barrier Park (TBP) all but one of the samples were deficient 245 \nin available potassium and phosphorus and over half were deficient in available magnesium, in 246 \n (11) \ncomparison to literature guidelines. At Russia Dock (RD) all samples were deficient in available 247 \nphosphorus, contained adequate magnesium, but were deficient in potassium at approximately 248 \none third of the sampling locations. The least fertile site with respect to tree growth was 249 \nEastbrookend (EBE) where all samples suggested a deficiency of available potassium, 250 \nmagnesium and phosphorus. At these sites, the prognosis for healthy tree growth was poor \u2013 this 251 \nsuggests that TBP, RD and EBE did not succeed in providing a suitable medium for sustainable 252 \ntree growth.  253 \nThe successful establishment of a diverse wildflower grassland favours soil of poor 254 \nfertility (Agate, 2002). In contrast to nutrient availability for tree growth, soil fertility exceeded 255 \nwildflower\u201fs preference range with respect to available potassium and phosphorus (Table 4) at all 256 \nsites except TBP and Ibstocks (IBS). High fertility constrains wildflower meadows because more 257 \ncompetitive species (particularly grasses) tend to thrive in areas of bare earth required for 258 \nperennial seed setting (Agate, 2002). The results suggested that only TBP and IBS had a soil 259 \nresource appropriate to wildflower establishment; Bow Creek (BC), Ingrebourne Hill (IH), RD 260 \nand EBE were unlikely to be successful in the establishment of naturalistic wildflower meadows 261 \nwithout intensive management input. 262 \n 263 \nWoodland establishment: vegetation establishment and quality of trees and wildflowers 264 \nA number of parameters of vegetation health and quality are useful in determining the 265 \nsuccess of vegetation establishment, including survival rate, vigour, growth rate (height or 266 \nbiomass) and visual appearance. In this study, tree vigour - expressed as crown density, 267 \nappearance and elemental leaf concentrations (Table 5) - was investigated. Low crown densities 268 \n(15-30%) occurred in areas of low nutrient availability, and leaf discoloration (browning) 269 \noccurred in trees growing in areas of elevated concentrations of available boron, zinc, cadmium 270 \nor lead. For example, at Bow Creek (BC) low crown density was observed in field maples 271 \n (12) \ngrowing in soils deficient in K, Mg, and P. Low crown density and leaf discoloration could also 272 \nbe related to poor rooting conditions (e.g., soil compaction and water availability) and tree vigour 273 \nmay have been hindered by excessive weed growth. 274 \n 275 \nInsert Table 5. Leaf tissue concentration ranges recorded at case studies sites and literature 276 \nvalues used for comparison. 277 \n 278 \nFoliar concentrations of lead, zinc and cadmium were elevated in comparison to published 279 \ntolerance ranges at each of the case study sites, particularly in certain species. For example, 280 \nsamples of silver birch displayed elevated concentrations of zinc in two third of samples at 281 \nEastbrookend (EBE) and in all samples from BC. Similarly, eared willow (Salix aurita (L.)) 282 \ndisplayed elevated zinc concentrations in seven out of eleven samples and elevated cadmium 283 \nconcentrations in all samples from Ibstocks (IBS). Five of six grey willow (Salix cinerea (L.)) 284 \nsamples taken at Russia Dock (RD) contained elevated zinc concentrations. Elevated lead 285 \nconcentrations were recorded in eared willow, silver birch and alder (Alnus spp) at IBS. For each 286 \nspecies investigated, concentrations were not correlated with soil pH. Other factors may have 287 \ncontributed to the elevated foliar concentrations (e.g. the propensity of some species\/varieties to 288 \nbioaccumulate, Gussarsson, 1994; Punshon and Dickinson, 1997). Furthermore, the CaCl2-289 \nextractable assessment demonstrated local elevation in the putative bioavailable fraction; e.g., 290 \nCaCl2-extractable zinc ranged 0.2-0.5 mg\/l across all case study sites, with \u201ehotspots\u201f of >2 mg\/l 291 \nat each. Local elevations in the CaCl2-extractable fraction were also noted for lead, boron, 292 \ncopper, barium and cadmium at more than one site. 293 \nBased upon trees growing on green and brownfield sites, Dickinson (2000) and Sopper 294 \n(1989) suggested a boron foliar concentration tolerance level of 100 mg\/kg, above which 295 \ndecreases in growth may be expected. All sites, except IBS, had boron foliar concentrations in 296 \n (13) \nexcess of this tolerance level including eared willow and silver birch at Bow Creek (BC); eared 297 \nwillow (all samples) and dogrose (Rosa canina (L.), 4\/5 samples) at EBE; Eared willow (all 298 \nsamples) and oak (Quercus spp, 3\/5 samples) at IH; in all grey willow, maple, oak, London plane 299 \n(Platanus acerifolia (Aiton) willd.), false acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia (L.) and grey poplar 300 \n(Populus x canescens (Aiton) Sm.) at RD; and, finally, in more than half of the oak, Norway 301 \nmaple (Acer platanoides (L.)) and hornbeam (Carpinus betulus (L.)) at Thames Barrier Park 302 \n(TBP). At each of these sites, a high percentage (10-50%) of the total soil boron was CaCl2-303 \nextractable and, therefore, may be considered available for plant uptake. However, elevated boron 304 \nfoliar concentrations did not correlate with visual signs of poor tree health.  305 \nFoliar concentration measurements do not demonstrate site success or failure alone. For 306 \nexample, many species are capable of tolerating concentrations significantly elevated in 307 \ncomparison to background levels without adverse toxicological effect. These results support other 308 \nstudies demonstrating accumulation of various metals\/metalloids in birches (Gussarsson, 1994) 309 \nand willows (Punshon and Dickinson, 1997). However, long-term monitoring of tree health may 310 \nbe necessary as accumulating species may constitute pollutant pathways to sensitive receptors 311 \n(e.g., food-chain transfer and leaf litter recycling). 312 \nThe diversity of wildflower species recorded at the case study sites ranged from zero to 313 \nnine per quadrat and was typically 3-5 species. Some of these areas were dedicated by design to 314 \nwildflowers (i.e. were seeded for wildflowers, although may not have received the appropriate 315 \nground preparation or on-going maintenance). Others were subject to natural regeneration by 316 \ngrasses and wildflowers. At Bow Creek (BC), two wildflower and grassland areas recorded 317 \nspecies diversity of 9 and 6 per quadrat. At Ibstock (IBS), species desirable because of their 318 \naesthetic appeal, rarity or importance to biodiversity such as yellow rattle (Rhinanthus minor 319 \n(L.)), rough hawkbit (Leontodon hispidus (L.)) and devilsbit scabious (Succisa pratensis 320 \n(Moench.)) competed with smothering and\/or aggressive species such as common ragwort 321 \n (14) \n(Senecio jacobea (L.)) and \u201emares-tail\u201f (Equisetum spp (L.)). Furthermore, a natural regeneration 322 \narea was predominated by bramble (Rubus fruticosus (agg) (L.)), creeping thistle (Cirsium 323 \narvense (L.) Scop.), broadleaf dock (Rumex obtusifolius (L.)) and silverweed (Argentina anserine 324 \n(L.) Rydb.). At Russia Dock (RD), a wildflower area, whilst containing cow parsley (Anthriscus 325 \nsylvestris (L.) Hoffm.) and field rose (Rosa arvensis Hudson), also contained the binding cleavers 326 \n(Galium aparine (L.)), poisonous deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna (L.)) and bramble \u2013 327 \nplants commonly associated with compacted low nutrient soils. Predominance was also observed 328 \nlocally for species favoured because of their ecological function \u2013 such as willowherb (Epilobium 329 \nhirsutum (L.)), a good provider of pollen and nectar. The diversity of species identified 330 \ndemonstrated that wildflower meadows had not been successfully established and changes to soil 331 \npreparation or management regimes were required if this objective was to be met.  332 \nWith the exception of Thames Barrier Park (TBP), each case study site displayed 333 \nlocalised patches of poor growth in grassland areas (i.e. less than 50 % surface coverage). 334 \nPhysicochemical parameters analysed at each of these locations demonstrated that in most cases 335 \nthe problems related to soil pH, low nutrient availability or compaction. For example, a sampling 336 \nlocation at IBS dominated by coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara (L.)), ragwort, creeping thistle, 337 \nwillowherb and broadleaf dock may be explained by the low soil pH. At Eastbrookend (EBE), 338 \nareas of grass surface coverage of < 35 % may have been the consequence of an inappropriate 339 \ngrass seed mix for soil pH 6.0. At IH, soil pH of 3.4 limited the presence of grasses and 340 \nwildflowers, although oaks, eared Willow, Corsican pine and silver birch grew in the locality. At 341 \nRD, an area of cow parsley, bramble and red deadnettle (Lamium purpureum (L.)) growth, 342 \nproviding on average 25 % surface coverage, suffered from very compacted soil (> 5 MPa) below 343 \n15 cm depth. Poor quality tree growth (crown densities of 25-40 %) were also recorded for birch, 344 \nwillow, ash, maples and poplars growing in areas with soil compaction (> 4 MPa) at depths as 345 \nshallow as 15-30 cm at Russia Dock (RD), Ingrebourne Hill (IH), Bow Creek (BC) and EBE. A 346 \n (15) \nsoil strength value of 2-3 MPa has been found to significantly limit root development (Greacen 347 \nand Sands, 1980). Non-compacted soil with soil density < 1.5 g cm\n-3\n to 50 cm depth has been 348 \nproposed as best practice in brownfield land reclamation for tree establishment (Bending et al., 349 \n1999).  350 \n 351 \nAmenity greenspace and social value: visitor survey perspectives 352 \nA major social sustainability criterion for new greenspace is that it should be wanted by 353 \nits intended users (Moffat and Hutchings, 2007). Therefore, success criteria included the creation 354 \nof spaces for diverse activities, local use and the promotion of social diversity. These criteria 355 \nwere reflected in visitor surveys for Thames Barrier Park (TBP) and Eastbrookend (EBE). 356 \nA comparison of questionnaires conducted at TBP and EBE showed different patterns of 357 \nuse depending on the destination type. The formal design of TBP was intended to create a tourist 358 \ndestination, as well as a place for locals to relax, yet the predominance of occasional and first-359 \ntime and early afternoon visitors suggests that TBP is a tourist destination rather than a local 360 \namenity (Table 6). In comparison, use of EBE is widespread and most visitors arrive by foot or 361 \nbicycle, which suggests local usage. Previous visitor surveys at TBP suggested that whilst the site 362 \nwas highly regarded by site users, it was relatively poorly used by neighbouring communities and 363 \nuser groups did not reflect the local ethnic diversity of UK census data (Villella et al., 2006). 364 \nThus, TBP did not fully meet the stated aim of promoting social diversity. 365 \n 366 \nInsert Table 6. Summary of visitor survey questionnaire results performed at Eastbrookend 367 \nCountry Park (EBE) and Thames Barrier Park (TBP) 368 \n 369 \nVisitor surveys showed that the reasons stated for visiting EBE and TBP were very 370 \nsimilar, including walking, relaxing and exercise, as well as site specific attributes such as fishing 371 \n (16) \nat EBE and visiting the caf\u00e9 at TBP (Table 6). Respondents pointed out potential improvements 372 \nfor both sites, including signage, information boards and other infrastructure. Addressing these 373 \nsite specific failures may encourage target audiences to visit but would not, in themselves, 374 \nconstitute a measure of success.  375 \nThe importance of wildlife as part of a visit scored very highly at both sites, with 86 and 376 \n71% of respondents stating it to be \u201every important\u201f or \u201eimportant\u201f at EBE and TBP, respectively. 377 \nEBE respondents also stated that more trees and wildflowers and other animals would be valued 378 \nimprovements, suggesting that existing vegetation was inadequate. The woodland establishment 379 \ndata (soil chemical, vegetation establishment and quality) presented in previous sections raise a 380 \nnumber of questions concerning the viability and sustainability of the established habitats (e.g., 381 \nbecause of soil fertility) and demonstrate that reclamation works must be appropriate given the 382 \nimportance of wildlife to visitor experience. In summary, the social surveys highlighted three 383 \nfactors (quality, design and biodiversity) as important site attributes. Quality in design, site 384 \ndelivery and on-going management and maintenance therefore lend themselves as important 385 \ninput and output success criteria, and biodiversity as an important outcome success criterion.  386 \nSurveys of visitors to urban greenspace typically quote aesthetics alongside safety as key 387 \nfactors that would lead them to feel excluded from a site. Survey data demonstrated an array of 388 \nproblems affecting the aesthetic appeal of the case studies including litter; water-logged paths 389 \n(because of ground compaction); arson damage; patchy grass growth; unauthorised construction 390 \nof cycle jumps; and Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica (Houtt.)) a highly invasive non-native 391 \nspecies indicative of inadequate site management. Lack of appeal and low frequency of use may 392 \npromote anti-social behaviour, neglect and decline, and are indicators of potential problems for 393 \nthe future success of the greenspace.  394 \n 395 \n (17) \nDiscussion 396 \nDelivering a brownfield greening project on time, on budget, with the ascribed habitats 397 \nand infrastructure is not enough to guarantee the success of a new greenspace, either in the 398 \ncontext of its aims or in the long-term (Sellers et al., 2006). Many project aims and objectives are 399 \nby definition outcomes and therefore cannot be measured immediately upon delivery of a 400 \ngreenspace, nor can they always be measured directly. This research indicates that there is a gap 401 \nbetween measuring outputs as indicators of success and achieving the \u201eoutcome\u201f project aims and 402 \nobjectives envisaged. Whilst this research focussed on greenspace projects, the findings are 403 \nsupportive of calls in the literature to promote brownfield development sustainability in the wider 404 \nsense (Pediaditi, et al., 2006; De Sousa, 2008). This research also, therefore, focussed on socio-405 \nenvironmental outcomes of brownfield regeneration, but not socio-economic. 406 \nThe aim \u201eto establish habitats\u201f had been only partially successful at the case studies, with 407 \npoor quality tree health (leaf discoloration) and growth (low crown density) recorded. Woodland 408 \nestablishment was compromised in the long term by poor soil nutrient quality and foliar 409 \naccumulation of metals\/metalloids. Applying the logic model demonstrates the need for 410 \ncontinuity in design, development, management and evaluation; e.g., the development phase 411 \nestablishes the planting medium - the foundation for the successful establishment of vegetation, 412 \nhowever, site developers are typically not the site owner\/manager and are unlikely to be formally 413 \nassociated with a greenspace as it matures. Therefore, evaluation of development phase inputs 414 \n(e.g. monitored by the developer) and project outputs (monitored by the developer and\/or site 415 \nowner\/manager) provide a prognosis of success that can only be affirmed by monitoring and 416 \nmedium- to long-term outcome evaluation. Ensuring continuity in evaluation through the project 417 \nphase and post-regeneration will help ensure successful long-term project delivery. 418 \nWith respect to the provision of quality greenspaces with social and amenity value, the 419 \nsuccess of the case study sites is also questionable. The use of the sites by age and ethnically 420 \n (18) \ndiverse groups was an outcome aim for Eastbrookend and Thames Barrier Park; yet visitor 421 \nsurveys indicate that this aim has not yet been achieved. Managers should determine whether this 422 \ncan be achieved by further work or if the original project aims were unrealistic (see Villella et al., 423 \n2006).  424 \nImproved access to \u201equality\u201f greenspace is a common aim in greenspace establishment 425 \nprojects (whether green- or brown-field land regenerations). Successful delivery of this aim 426 \nrequires an understanding of greenspace \u201equality\u201f. Yet, greenspace \u201equality\u201f is an emergent 427 \nproperty, complex to understand and deliver. Greenspace quality needs to consider all users of the 428 \ngreenspace (NAO, 2006). Harshaw et al. (2007) stated that visitor satisfaction is a 429 \nmultidimensional concept dependent upon not only resource, social and management settings but 430 \nalso socio-economic and cultural characteristics, experience, attitudes, preferences and norms. 431 \nThis research support claims that large capital expenditures do not guarantee visitor satisfaction, 432 \nquality or success, but that design and on-going management and maintenance are influential. 433 \nGreenspaces are dynamic places: vegetation grows, ecological succession takes place and 434 \nsocial attitudes toward the place change. Given this dynamism, a greenspace considered 435 \nsuccessful relative to establishment aims may become \u201eunsuccessful\u201f or \u201eless successful\u201f as the 436 \nroles it is expected to fulfil change. Thus, in the context of greenspaces, success is more than just 437 \n\u201eattaining a desired state\u201f: it has to be embedded within a process of review and re-evaluation as a 438 \nsite matures. A site management plan typically contains sub-sections on monitoring but not all 439 \nsites have such a plan and the monitoring specified may not support assessment of outcomes, 440 \nespecially where the focus is on quantitative measures. Irrespective of the history or primary 441 \nfunctionality of the greenspace, evaluation of data collected is required to assess outcomes, to 442 \nmanage the greenspace more effectively, to identify good practice and to allow accurate reporting 443 \nto key stakeholders (DETR, 1999). Given the social and environmental benefits of a quality 444 \n (19) \ngreenspace, the presence and appropriate management of greenspaces should be welcomed, even 445 \nin light of the establishment and maintenance mentioned above. 446 \nMonitoring and evaluation affords many opportunities over and above assessment of 447 \nproject delivery including:  448 \ni) supporting the site management cycle - management efficiency and effectiveness, 449 \nii) informing funding bodies and other stakeholders,  450 \niii) learning lessons, 451 \niv) formulating best practice, 452 \nv) providing opportunities for community engagement.  453 \nCharacterisation of outcomes is not always dependent on expert assessment; rather, many 454 \nindicators (such as bird and butterfly counts) can be captured by local residents or volunteer 455 \ngroups, which is in itself an opportunity to deliver against social outcomes such as education, 456 \nvolunteering and encouraging community cohesion. Problems associated with long-term 457 \nmonitoring and evaluation should also be recognised, including cost, time, skills-base and 458 \nstakeholder capacity (e.g., see De Sousa, 2008). Therefore, capital regeneration funds must be 459 \nsupported by a revenue package to manage and maintain the established greenspaces, and fund 460 \nmonitoring.  461 \nThis research supports the UK\u201fs National Audit Office call for increased investment and 462 \nquality standards for urban greenspace (NAO, 2006). Different forms of greenspace require a 463 \nrange of appropriate benchmark standards encompassing inter alia recreational spaces, habitats, 464 \ngreen-infrastructure and formal planting. Such benchmark standards should be refined through 465 \nmultidisciplinary input, peer-review and ongoing research and applied via the site management 466 \nplan review. The research highlights the need for sustainability objectives to be defined and 467 \nagreed for each site as a matter of good practice to drive delivery and success (Doick et al., 468 \n2009). 469 \n (20) \nSuccess for brownfield greening projects can be defined as the on-going delivery of site aims 470 \nand objectives. This requires developers and managers to shift their focus from project 471 \ncompletion to project outcomes and to adopt a fluid monitoring and evaluation process of 472 \ngreenspaces. Such a process must integrate a broad range of stakeholder perspectives and be 473 \ndesigned with long-term sustainability of the greenspace in mind. This research does not 474 \ndisregard the efforts made towards the successful regeneration of brownfield land, but rather 475 \naimed to emphasise the need of a clear understanding of success, adapted to the context of 476 \nregeneration and evaluated in terms of its outcomes, rather than just its outputs, in order to strive 477 \ntowards sustainable quality greenspaces. 478 \n 479 \nAcknowledgements 480 \nThe authors thank Jessica Villella and Alison Kirrage for undertaking the field work; Tony 481 \nHutchings and Andy Moffat as principal investigators; Rona Pitman and Sue Benham for 482 \nvegetation identification and advice; and EPSRC for funding this work as part of the SUBR:IM 483 \nconsortium under Grant GR\/S148809\/01. 484 \n 485 \nReferences 486 \nAgate, E. 2002.

Construction exposed hitherto buried soils containing zinc, arsenic, copper and \nmercury hotspots. \nSoils were imported (200 mm depth) and grass sown. A complex 2.6 ha ecology park was built and \nopened in 1996 featuring patches of woodland and wetland areas fed by water sluices. By 1998, the \npark had severe problems including incorrectly managed wetland systems, collapsed embankments, \nunsafe boardwalks and was closed on safety grounds. A further \u00a32 million was invested in re-\nlandscaping in 2006 (one year after the data for this study was collected) and, recognising the sites \nlimited vehicular access and vulnerability to vandalism, a new management plan was created, the \nsite re-opened in June 2006.  \nEastbrookend \nCountry \nPark, Rush \nGreen, \nRomford, \nLondon \n(EBE) \nTQ507859 1995 \u00a32.5 million  \n(~ \u00a331,000) \nFrom 1920 to the 1950s this area of farmland (80 ha) was opened for gravel extraction and, \nsubsequently, in-filled with uncontrolled waste. \nAfter closure, the area was vacant until the 1980s when it was converted to a country park with a low \nbudget. Natural regeneration was preferred to active restoration although various waste materials, \nincluding London Clay, were brought in. The park was split into three areas with distinct \nmanagement regimes: Fels field, Eastbrookend Grove and a lake, and opened in 1995. \nIbstock (the \nDaisyfield \nLandfill \nSite), Lea \nGreen Road, \nSt Helens \n(IBS) \nSJ514917 1996 (regeneration \nobligated by \nplanning; \nbudget \nunknown) \nFormerly agricultural land, Ibstocks (45 ha) is a mosaic of former land uses including a colliery \nrailway site, clay pits (for brickworks) and, subsequently, landfill sites, initially for non hazardous \nindustrial waste (from 1966) but later (1969) for general packaging waste. Contaminant risks \ninclude leachate contamination of ground and surface waters and methane production. In 1996, \nplanning permission was obtained for further clay extraction, land-filling of the void and limited \nrestoration of closed landfill areas to green open space with community access. Poorly executed, \nremedial works were subsequently required including deepening the soil resource to > 300mm. \nPrevious surveys recorded nothing of ecological significance on site. Daisyfields - a 4 ha ex-landfill \nsite \u2013 was the only part of the Ibstock site surveyed in this study. \nIngrebourne \nHill \ncommunity \nwoodland, \nRainham, \nHornchurch, \nEssex \nTQ526836 1996 \n(initially) \nand 2007 \n(regeneration \nobligated by \nplanning; \ncosts \nunknown) \n \nOriginally agricultural land, the 74 ha site was used for sand and gravel extraction between 1932 and \n1960, followed by uncontrolled tipping and land-filling. Subsequently, the area was restored with \ninert soil forming material and soils excavated on site, the new voids being used to created lakes \nand wetland areas.  \nThe site is bounded to the southeast by an SSSI (Ingrebourne marshes). Restoration specifications \nrequired soil forming material to a depth of 0.5 m in open areas and to at least 1.5 m depth where \ntrees were to be planted. A shipment of pyritic London clays used to restore some areas led to tree \n (28) \n(IH) death. Subsequently, the inappropriate material was replaced with new material and replanted.  \nIn 2007, two years after the data for this study was performed, \u00a31 million was invested to regenerate \nthe site as community woodland with mixed grassland open space and woodland planting. \nRussia Dock \nPark, Salter \nRoad, \nRotherhythe, \nLondon \n(RD) \nTQ362801 1980s \n(initially) \nand 2003  \n(initial costs \nunknown) \nRestoration in \n2003 - \n\u00a3350,000 \n(\u00a317,500) \nInitially marshland unsuitable for farming, the land including the neighbouring village of \nRotherhythe, was developed in the 1600\u201fs for shipbuilding and docks. By the 19th-Century the \ndocks were handling grain, timber, cheese, bacon, and served as a base for whaling fleets. As ships \ngot bigger, the docks became less suitable and closed in 1969. No contamination issues were \nreported. Approximately 20 ha, the site was developed as an island of woodland, wetland (based \nupon a complex pumping system) and open grass, with adjacent sports facilities and an ecology \npark. \nCompleted in the 1980\u201fs, the site was handed to Southwark council. Restoration retained historical \nand cultural significance such as the old wharf edges. The park declined for many years until a \nsimpler \u201esustainable\u201f plan was implemented in 2003 by Southwark Borough Council. \nThames \nBarrier Park, \nNorth \nWoolwich \nRoad, \nLondon \n(TBP) \nTQ414798 2000 \u00a312 million \n(\u00a31.35 \nmillion) \nThis formal garden (8.9 ha) situated adjacent to the River Thames in the London Borough of \nNewham is a former dock and industrial chemicals factory. It was left contaminated upon closure \nof the docks in the 1960s.  \nCreation of the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) in 1981 saw this and \nsurrounding areas regenerated, mainly for housing and commercial development, but also for \ngreenspace. The park was created by clearing the derelict land of physical structures and \ncontaminated soils, capping it with a capillary break layer and importing soils (2.5 m - trees, 1 m - \nwildflower meadow\/ grasses). The park remains sacrificial land, in case the Thames barrier fails. \nAnnual running costs are quoted as \u00a3700k (Villella et al., 2006). \n (29) \nTable 3. Methods of data collection and laboratory analysis.  \nEnvironmental \nresearch \nSoil analysis Soil cores taken at depths of 30 cm (wildflower areas) or 60 cm (tree areas), containerised, labelled, \nstored (0-4 \no\nC). \nSoil pH was determined in the laboratory using a 0.01 M CaCl2 solution according to the method of \nAvery and Bascomb (1982). This solution was subsequently filtered through No 42 Whatman Filters \nand the supernatant retained at 0-4 \no\nC, until required for elemental analysis.  \nConcentrations were determined for potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), boron (B), copper \n(Cu), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), cobalt (Co) and barium (Ba) by \nInductively Coupled Plasma \u2013 Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) (Spectrohm, Germany) \nfollowing CaCl2 or aqua regia digest, using standard laboratory protocols for measurement, calibration \nand calculation (Kilbride et al., 2006).  \nSoil \ncompaction  \nPenetration resistance was recorded using a modified Bush recording cone penetrometer (Anderson et \nal., 1980). The penetrometer recorded soil resistance at 0.03 m depth intervals to total depth of 0.45 m \n(Sinnett et al., 2006).  \nFoliar \nanalysis \nGrass and wildflower vegetation sampled using a 0.5 m\n2\n quadrat. Vegetation was cut, bulked and stored \nin a paper bag. Conifers were sampled by collecting 5 current year shoots from 5 trees of the same \nspecies cut from the first whorl below the leader (the needles were not stripped off), between early \nOctober and mid November. Deciduous conifer and broadleaf trees were sampled by collecting a leaf \narea equivalent to one A4 sheet of paper of fully expanded undamaged leaves between late July and \nlate August. Trees less than two growing seasons old were not included as they reflect nursery nutrient \nand contaminant conditions. Crown density was determined according to the methods outlined for each \nspecies by Innes (1990). \nTree and \nwildflower \nidentificatio\nn  \nTree identification was carried out in the field by qualified personal. For grasses and wildflowers, a 0.5 \nm\n2\n quadrat was placed at 5 sub-sites per zone and a species count, estimate of percentage cover and \nspecies identification performed. Those plants that could not be identified in the field were sampled \nand returned to the laboratory for subsequent identification using Rose (1991) and Stace (1997) as \nprimary references. \nSocial \nresearch \nVisitor \nsurvey \nVisitor surveys were carried out in Eastbrookend Country Park (EBE) and Thames Barrier Park (TBP). \nSurveys sought to determine who used the park (in terms of gender, age, income and ethnicity), how \nthey travelled to and how they used the park, what they liked about the park and how it could be \nimproved.
