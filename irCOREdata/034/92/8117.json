Aerial photographs taken between 2000 and 2004 document the abandonment and fill of a 1.3 km-long, 80 m-wide anabranch channel in the sandy braided South Saskatchewan River, Canada. Upstream river regulation traps the majority of very fine sediment and there is little clay (less than 1%) in the bed sediments. Channel abandonment was initiated by a series of unit bars that stalled and progressively blocked the anabranch entrance, together with dune deposition and stacking at the anabranch entrance and exit. Complete channel abandonment and subsequent fill of up to 3 m of sediment took approximately two years. Thirteen kilometres of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) surveys, coupled with 18 cores, were obtained over the channel fill and an adjacent 750 m-long, 400 m-wide, compound bar, enabling a quantitative analysis of the channel and bar deposits. Results show that in terms of grain size trends, facies proportions and scale of deposits, there are only subtle differences between the channel fill and bar deposits, which therefore renders them indistinguishable.
