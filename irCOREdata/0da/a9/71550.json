Introduction\nCircular ensembles of unitary matrices were first considered by Dyson [1] and described\nin detail by Mehta [2]. They are used to describe the quantum statistics of periodically\ndriven systems (see [3] and references therein) and of scattering processes [4]. It is the\nunitary Floquet operator in the first case and the unitary S-matrix in the second that the\nrandom unitary matrices in question attempt to mimic with respect to certain more or less\nuniversal properties. Systems with global chaos in their classical limit and with time reversal\ninvariance either present or strongly broken exhibit the greatest degree of universality in\ntheir statistical properties and tend to fall into one of the universality classes represented\nby the circular orthogonal, symplectic, or unitary ensembles (COE, CSE, CUE). The so-\ncalled Poissonian ensemble (CPE) of diagonal unitary matrices with independent unimodular\neigenvalues has also found applications for certain classically integrable systems. There has\nbeen a recent interest in the analysis of intermediate ensembles of unitary matrices which\ndescribe the crossover between different universality classes [5\u20137]. Direct links between\ncorresponding Gaussian and circular ensembles have been established lately [8, 9].\nUnitarity constraints imposed on a random matrix of small size N cause a significantly\nnon-Gaussian character of the distribution of matrix elements [10\u201312]. Moreover, various\nstatistics of unitary matrices from the different circular ensembles depend strongly on the\nmatrix size, and for small N differ a great deal from the asymptotic large N properties. This\nis in contrast to the Gaussian ensembles of Hermitian matrices [2] which tend to display\nlesser sensitivity to the matrix dimension.\n0305-4470\/96\/133641+18$19.50 c\u00a9 1996 IOP Publishing Ltd 3641\n3642 F Haake et al\nFor example, the normalized level spacing distribution P(S) suffers a cut-off at S D N ,\nand is close to the Wigner-like distributions only for N upwards of roughly 10. Moreover,\nBaranger and Mello [13] have shown that the distribution of transmission intensities P(T )\nis non-Gaussian for N D 2 and 4, whereas coming close to Gaussian for larger N .\nWe were led to study the secular polynomials of random unitary matrices in an attempt\nat constructing semiclassical quasi-energy spectra for the kicked top under conditions of\nclassical chaos. Periodic-orbit theory can be invoked only insofar as periodic orbits are\navailable. In practice, as for any system for which no simple symbolic dynamics is known,\none can hope to find all periodic orbits with periods no longer than maybe nmax \u0019 10,\ndue to the infamous exponential proliferation. These would allow one to semiclassically\nevaluate traces of powers of the Floquet operator, trFn, with n up to nmax. A Hilbert space\nof dimension N D 2nmax is then accessible since Newton\u2019s formulae [14] (see section 2)\nallow one to express the first nmax coefficients of the secular polynomial in terms of the first\nnmax traces; the so-called self-inversiveness of the secular polynomials of unitary matrices\n[15] then yields the second half of the set of coefficients. The practical applicability of\nperiodic-orbit theory would thus seem severely limited. Inasmuch as the dimension N of\nthe Hilbert space is proportional to the effective size of quantum fluctuations (formally,\nN \/ 1\/h\u00af) one runs out of periodic orbits just when the semiclassical approximation begins\nto have a raison d\u2019e\u02c6tre.\nTo ease the dilemma just described, one might hope to increase the size of the Hilbert\nspace by throwing dice, according to random-matrix theory, for traces with exponents\nnmax < n < N \u2212 nmax. To prepare for such a \u2018marriage\u2019 of semiclassical approximations\nwith random-matrix theory we propose to study here secular polynomials of random unitary\nmatrices from various ensembles. A previous first step in this direction was taken in [16],\nwhere the means and the mean squares of the coefficients mentioned were calculated for the\nCPE and the CUE. A related study was presented by Bogomolny et al [15, 17] who gave\nthe distribution of the roots of random self-inverse polynomials.\nEven though the bulk of the work to be presented is analytical we performed extensive\ncomparisons with numerical data on ensembles of unitary matrices. To generate the data\nwe constructed COE and CUE matrices with the algorithm given in [18] and CSE matrices\nas described in [19].\n2. Coefficients of secular polynomials\n2.1. Theory\nThe secular polynomial of a unitary matrix U of size N is defined as\ndet(U \u2212 \u03bb) D\nNX\nnD0\n(\u2212\u03bb)naN\u2212n D\nY\ni\n(ei\u03d5i \u2212 \u03bb) (1)\nwhere the \u03d5i are the eigenphases of U and a0 D 1. We are interested in the statistics of the\nsecular coefficients an due to various ensembles of random matrices. We shall characterize\nthese ensembles by their joint densities of the N eigenphases \u03d5i ,\nd\n\u03b2\nN(\u03d51, \u03d52, . . . , \u03d5N) D C(\u03b2, N)\nY\ni<j\njei\u03d5i \u2212 ei\u03d5j j\u03b2 (2)\nwhere C(\u03b2, N) is a normalization constant while \u03b2, the so-called degree of level repulsion,\ndistinguishes the ensembles: \u03b2 D 0 for the Poissonian ensemble for which the eigenphases\nare independently and uniformly distributed over the interval [0, 2pi); the circular orthogonal,\nSecular determinants of random unitary matrices 3643\nunitary, and symplectic ensembles are characterized by, respectively, \u03b2 D 1, \u03b2 D 2, and\n\u03b2 D 4. Occasionally we shall allow the parameter \u03b2 to range freely among the real numbers.\nAll of the ensembles in consideration are homogeneous inasmuch they do not distinguish\nany particular value of any eigenphase. It follows immediately that the ensemble means of\nall coefficients of the secular polynomial vanish,\nan D\nZ 2pi\n0\nd\u03d51 . . . d\u03d5NaNd\u03b2N(\u03d51, \u03d52, . . . , \u03d5N) D 0. (3)\nNext, we are interested in the ensemble averages ana\u0003m which can be obtained from the\ngenerating function\nP\n\u03b2\nN D det(U \u2212 \u03bb)(U \u2212 \u00b5)\u2020 D\nY\nk\n(ei\u03d5k \u2212 \u03bb)(ei\u03d5k \u2212 \u00b5)\u0003 (4)\nD\nZ 2pi\n0\nd\u03d51 . . . d\u03d5Nd\u03b2N(\u03d51, \u03d52, . . . , \u03d5N)\nY\nk\n(ei\u03d5k \u2212 \u03bb)(ei\u03d5k \u2212 \u00b5)\u0003.\nFor \u03bb D ei\u03d5 , \u00b5 D ei\u03c7 it follows from the periodicity of the integrand that the integral\ndepends on the phases \u03d5, \u03c7 only through the variable x D ei(\u03d5\u2212\u03c7). Thus our generating\nfunction may be written as\nP\n\u03b2\nN(x) D\nY\ni\n(ei\u03d5i \u2212 ei\u03d5)(e\u2212i\u03d5i \u2212 e\u2212i\u03c7 ) D\nY\ni\nf (\u03d5i, x) D\nNX\nnD0\nxnjanj2 (5)\nwhere we have introduced the auxiliary function\nf (\u03d5, x) D (ei\u03d5 \u2212 x)(e\u2212i\u03d5 \u2212 1). (6)\nHence all correlations ana\u0003m for m 6D n vanish. Moreover, one easily shows\njanj2 D jaN\u2212nj2 (7)\nwhich is in accord with the so-called self-inversiveness, aN\u2212n D a\u0003naN [14]; being a\nconsequence of but slightly weaker than unitarity self-inversiveness entails each root of\na polynomial to either lie on the unit circle of the complex plane or to be accompanied by\nits inverse as another root.\nThe variances janj2 are most easily calculated in the Poissonian case \u03b2 D 0,\nP 0N(x) D C(0, N)\n\u0014 Z 2pi\n0\nd\u03d5f (\u03d5, x)\n\u0015N\nD (1 C x)N . (8)\nTherefore janj2 D\n(\nN\nn\n\u0001\nfor \u03b2 D 0 [16].\nNext, we turn to the case \u03b2 D 2 which was already treated in [16]. Observing that\nthe function\nQ\ni f (\u03d5i, x) which we want to average is symmetric in the N phases \u03d5i and\nthat the density d2N may be written as a product of two Vandermonde determinants we have\n[2, 3]\nP 2N(x) D\nZ 2pi\n0\ndN\u03d5\n(2pi)N\ndet(ei(m\u22121)\u03d5m\u2212i(n\u22121)\u03d5m)\nY\nk\nf (\u03d5k, x) (9)\nwith m, n D 1, 2, . . . , N labelling the rows and columns of the determinant. The integral\nover \u03d5m can now be pulled into the mth row of that determinant whereupon we immediately\nget\nP 2N(x) D det((1 C x)\u03b4(m \u2212 n) \u2212 \u03b4(m \u2212 n C 1) \u2212 x\u03b4(m \u2212 n \u2212 1)) D\nNX\nnD0\nxN (10)\n3644 F Haake et al\nwhere \u03b4(m \u2212 n) denotes the Kronecker delta. The foregoing generating function entails the\nvariance janj2 D 1 for \u03b2 D 2.\nA little more effort is required for the orthogonal and symplectic cases (\u03b2 D 1, 4). In\nthe orthogonal case we again employ the symmetry of the integrand of the N -fold integral in\n(5) to rewrite that integral, which goes over the hypercube 0 6 \u03d51, \u03d52, . . . , \u03d5N 6 2pi , as N !\ntimes one over the hypertriangle 2pi > \u03d51 > \u03d52 > \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 > \u03d5N > 0. Within the hypertriangle\nthe product of differences takes the formY\nk<`\njei\u03d5k \u2212 ei\u03d5` j D\nY\nk<`\n2 sin\n\u0012\n\u03d5k \u2212 \u03d5`\n2\n\u0013\nD iN(N\u22121)\/2 det(eim\u03d51 , . . . , eim\u03d5N ). (11)\nThe second member in this chain of equated expressions is manifestly positive whereupon\nthe modulus operation can be dropped; the determinant in the last member of (11) has\nits rows labelled by the parameter m which runs in integer steps between (N \u2212 1)\/2 and\n(N C 1)\/2; the label for the columns is the one on the N integration variables. We may\nthus write the generating function as\nP 1N(x) D N !C(1, N)\n\u0002\nZ\n\u03d51>\u03d52...>\u03d5N\nd\u03d51 . . . d\u03d5N iN(N\u22121)\/2 det(eim\u03d51 , . . . , eim\u03d5N )\nY\nk\nf (\u03d5k, x). (12)\nFor the symplectic case we find it expedient to extend the N -fold integral in (5) to a\n(2N)-fold one,\nP 4N(x) D C(4, N)N !\nZ\n\u03d51>\u03d52>...>\u03d52N\nd\u03d51 . . . d\u03d52N\n1...2NY\nk<`\n\u0012\n2 sin\n\u0012\n\u03d5k \u2212 \u03d5`\n2\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0002\nNY\nkD1\n\u0014\nf (\u03d52k, x)\n\u0012 \u2212\u2202\n\u2202\u03d52k\u22121\n\u0013\n\u03b4 (\u03d52k\u22121 \u2212 \u03d52k \u2212 \u000f)\n\u0015\n(13)\nwhere \u000f is to be sent towards zero from above. To see the equivalence of the foregoing\nexpression to P 4N as given by (5) with \u03b2 D 4 we simply integrate by parts with respect\nto the phases with odd labels. Only those terms survive for which the N differentiations\nhave turned precisely those N sine functions into cosines which are assigned vanishing\narguments by the delta functions; the remaining sine functions then come in quadruples as,\nsymbolically, s13s14s23s24 ! s424. We should note in passing that the delta functions in the\nforegoing representation of P 4N reflect Kramer\u2019s degeneracy and that in our definition of the\nsecular polynomial for the symplectic ensemble each of the two-fold degenerate eigenphases\nappears only once.\nThe integral representations (12) and (13) are convenient starting points for an explicit\nevaluation of the generating functions P 1N and P 4N . We propose to start with the slightly\neasier symplectic case.\nIn order to actually evaluate the 2n-fold integral in (13) we once more employ the\nidentity (11) as extended to 2N ordered phases; we then integrate over every second phase\nto get rid of the delta functions. Upon renaming the remaining integration variables as\n\u03d52k ! \u03d5k and letting the positive infinitesimal \u000f go to zero we arrive at\nP 4N(x) D (\u22121)NC(4, N)\nZ 2pi\n0\ndN\u03d5 det(m eim\u03d51 , eim\u03d51 , m eim\u03d52 , eim\u03d52 , . . .)\nNY\nkD1\nf (\u03d5k, x) (14)\nwith jmj 6 (2N \u2212 1)\/2. Note that we have returned to an integral over an N -dimensional\nhypercube, exploiting the symmetry of the integrand. The difficulty to be coped with now\nlies in the fact that each of the N integration variables appears in a pair of rows of the\nSecular determinants of random unitary matrices 3645\n2N \u0002 2N determinant. At this point it is helpful to express that determinant by a Gaussian\nintegral over complex Grassmann variables as\ndetM D\nZ \u0012 Y\nk\nd\u03b7\u0003kd\u03b7k\n\u0013\nexp\n\u0012\n\u2212\nX\ni,j\n\u03b7\u0003kMkl\u03b7l\n\u0013\n. (15)\nAccounting for the matrix M from (14) and performing the 2N integrals over the \u03b7\u0003 we\narrive at Z 2pi\n0\ndN\u03d5 detM D\nZ \u0012 Y\nk\nd\u03b7k\n\u0013\u0014\n\u2212 12\nX\nm,m0\nAm,m0\u03b7m\u03b7m0\n\u0015N\nD N !\nZ \u0012 Y\nk\nd\u03b7k\n\u0013\nexp\n\u0014\n\u2212 12\nX\nm,m0\nAm,m0\u03b7m\u03b7m0\n\u0015\n(16)\nwith the antisymmetric 2N \u0002 2N matrix\nAmm0 D (m0 \u2212 m)\nZ 2pi\n0\nd\u03d5 ei(mCm0)\u03d5f (\u03d5, x)\nD 2pi(m0 \u2212 m)((1 C x)\u03b4(m C m0) \u2212 \u03b4(m \u2212 m0 C 1) \u2212 x\u03b4(m C m0 \u2212 1)). (17)\nThe labelling of the rows and columns of A is inherited from the ordered-phases form of\nthe Vandermonde determinant (11): both m and m0 run in integer steps from \u2212(2N \u2212 1)\/2\nto (2N \u2212 1)\/2. The remaining Gaussian integral in (16) is easily recognized as the Pfaffianp\ndetA of the antisymmetric matrix A, such that the generating function in search takes the\nform\nP 4N(x) D C(4, N)N !\np\ndetA. (18)\nThe sign of the Pfaffian\np\ndetA must be chosen such that P 4N(x) is positive for positive\nvalues of x, according to the definition of the generating function.\nIn a first attempt at evaluating the Pfaffian one may rejoice in the ease in finding it for\nsmall values of N which latter suggest a surmise for the general variance,\njanj2 D\n\u0012\nN\nn\n\u0013\n1 \u0002 3 . . . (2n \u2212 1)\n(2N \u2212 1)(2N \u2212 3) . . . (2N \u2212 2n C 1) for \u03b2 D 4. (19)\nThis conjecture will be proven in the appendix.\nWe finally turn to the orthogonal case, taking up the integral representation (12) for\nP 1N(x). For the sake of simplicity let us assume an even dimension N . We start with\nintegrating over the angles \u03d5i with even indices i, pulling the (2k)th such integral into the\n(2k)th row of the determinant; while that integral at first appears as going over the interval\n\u03d52kC1 < \u03d52k < \u03d52k\u22121 we can hurry to replace the lower limit with zero, simply by adding\nthe N th column to the (N \u2212 2)th, the resulting (N \u2212 2)th to the (N \u2212 4)th and so forth,\nand thus obtain\nP 1N(x) D C(1, N)N !\nZ\n\u03d51>\u03d53>...>\u03d5N\u22121\nd\u03d51d\u03d53 . . . d\u03d5N\u22121iN(N\u22121)\/2 det\n\u0012\neim\u03d51f (\u03d51, x),\n\u0002\nZ \u03d51\n0\nd\u03d5 eim\u03d5f (\u03d5, x), eim\u03d53f (\u03d53, x),\nZ \u03d53\n0\nd\u03d5 eim\u03d5f (\u03d5, x), . . .\n\u0013\n. (20)\nNow the integrand is symmetric in the remaining N integration variables whereupon we\nmay extend the integration range to the N -dimensional hypercube of edge length 2pi and\nmake up by dropping the factor N !, as we have previously done in (14). The analogy with\n(14) in fact goes much further: once more, every integration variable appears in two rows\n3646 F Haake et al\nof the determinant. Going through precisely the same reasoning as before we again incur a\nPfaffian form,\nP 1N(x) D C(1, N)N !\np\ndetB (21)\nwith the slightly more unpleasant antisymmetric matrix\nBmm0 D \u2212i\nZ 2pi\n0\nd\u03d5d\u03d50f (\u03d5, x)f (\u03d50, x) ei(m\u03d5Cm0\u03d50)sign(\u03d5 \u2212 \u03d50). (22)\nHere, the sign function ensures the antisymmetry of the matrix B with jmj 6 (N \u2212 1)\/2.\nAgain, the Pfaffian suggests, by its easily evaluated form for small dimensions N , a guess\nfor the variances,\njanj2 D 1 C n(N \u2212 n)\nN C 1 for \u03b2 D 1. (23)\nWe refer to the appendix for the proof of that surmise for N even or odd.\nUpon inspecting the variances found above for \u03b2 D 0, 2 and conjectured for \u03b2 D 1, 4\nwe were led to extrapolate to arbitrary non-negative \u03b2 as\njanj2 D\n\u0012\nN\nn\n\u0013\n1(1 C \u03b2\/2)(1 C \u03b2) . . .

(24)\nThis expression has poles at \u03b2 D \u22122\/(N \u2212 1), \u22122\/(N \u2212 2), . . . ,\u22122\/(N \u2212 n) and zeros\nat \u03b2 D \u22122\/1, \u22122\/2, \u22122\/3, . . . ,\u22122\/(n \u2212 1) for n 6 N\/2. It is thus analytic and positive\nfor all positive \u03b2, and it goes to zero for \u03b2 ! 1. This looks like strong evidence for\nthe general validity claimed before. We shall actually turn the conjecture into a theorem in\nthe appendix.

Numerical results\nWe constructed random unitary matrices U of different sizes according to the algorithm\ndeveloped in [18] for the CUE and the COE and later generalized for the CSE [19]. For each\nsuch matrix we calculated a complete set of N secular coefficients an by first computing the\ntraces of arbitrary powers, tn D tr(Un), via either matrix multiplication or diagonalization;\nNewton\u2019s formulae [14] (see next section) then led to the an.\nPrecise estimates of the variance of any random variable require a much larger sample\nthan estimates of the mean. We therefore present numerical results obtained for large\nsamples of relatively small random matrices (N \u0018 20), although some computations\nperformed for N \u0018 200 provide similar results.\nOur above formulae for the variance janj2 of the secular coefficients involve the index\nn of the coefficient and the matrix size N . The dependence on N saturates for large N .\nFigure 1 shows the dependence on n for a fixed matrix size. Due to the property (7) of\nself-inversiveness this curve is symmetric about n D N\/2.\nThe data of all three ensembles coincide (up to a statistical error) with the theoretical\npredictions. Note that the width of the distribution of coefficients decreases with increasing\nSecular determinants of random unitary matrices 3647\nFigure 1.

Additional numerical\ninvestigations confirmed the expectation that the phases of the an are distributed uniformly\nin the range [0, 2pi) for any canonical ensemble.\nEven though the formula (24) for the variance is primarily meant to cover the four\ncanonical ensembles \u03b2 D 0 (CPE), 1 (COE), 2 (CUE), and 4 (CSE), we could not resist\nthe temptation to test its usefulness for intermediate cases. To this end we constructed\nan ensemble of unitary matrices interpolating between the Poisson and unitary ensembles\naccording to the method presented in [20]. This intermediate ensemble depends on one\ncontrol parameter \u03b4, varying from 0 (CPE) to 1 (CUE). Figure 2 shows the dependence of\nthe variance of the first two coefficients on the matrix size N for \u03b4 equal to 0.0, 0.2, 0.4,\n0.7, and 1.0. For each case the value of the parameter \u03b2 chosen to fit the N dependence of\nja1j2, inserted into (24), provides a fair approximation for ja2j2, and similarly for subsequent\ncoefficients. This astonishing fact reveals a certain validity of the general formula (24) with\nnon-integer values of \u03b2 for ensembles in between the usual universality classes.\n3.

(28)\nWe infer from (27) that there are only N independent traces t1, . . . , tN . Moreover, for\nunitary matrices for which the eigenphases \u03d5i are real, the number of independent complex\nparameters is again reduced by a factor of a half. The first N\/2 traces suffice to determine\nall N coefficients an (cf (7)).\n3648 F Haake et al\nFigure 2. Variance of coefficients for crossover CPE\u2013CUE: (a) ja1j2 and (b) ja2j2 as functions\nof the matrix size N . Control parameter \u03b4 is equal to 0.0 (Poisson, \u2666), 0.2 (\u000f ), 0.4, 0.7 (\u0004), and\n1.0 (CUE, \u000e ), while the level-repulsion parameter \u03b2 fitted simultaneously for both coefficients\nequals 0.0, 0.06, 0.24, 0.69, and 2.0, respectively.\nClearly, the tn all vanish in the mean for all of the circular ensembles considered here,\ndue to the uniformity of the distribution of the \u03d5i . For a more complete characterization of\nthe statistics of the traces we propose to calculate their marginal probability densities\nP\n\u03b2\nN,n(t) D \u03b42\n\u0012\nt \u2212\nNX\niD1\nein\u03d5i\n\u0013\n(29)\nwhere \u03b42(t) is a two-dimensional delta function in the complex t plane; the ensemble average\nis to be performed with the weight (2). It turns out to be convenient to first calculate the\nFourier transform\nOP \u03b2N,n(k) D exp\n\u0012\n\u2212 12 i\nX\ni\n(k e\u2212in\u03d5i C k\u0003 eCin\u03d5i )\n\u0013\n. (30)\nDue to the periodicity of all functions of the phases \u03d5i involved, the characteristic functionOP \u03b2N,n(k) depends on k only through the modulus jkj while the density P \u03b2N,n(t) is only a\nfunction of jt j. Henceforth we assume k D k\u0003 D jkj and write\nOP \u03b2N,n(k) D exp\n\u0012\n\u2212 ik\nX\ni\ncos(n\u03d5i)\n\u0013\n. (31)\nWe immediately obtain for the Poissonian ensemble\nOP 0N,n(k) D J0(k)N (32)\nJ0(k) being a Bessel function. It follows that the densities P 0N,n are the same for all values\nof the exponent n, a rather intuitive result given the statistical independence of the phases\n\u03d5i in the Poissonian case. Equally expected for such a Poissonian random walk is the\nindependence of the mean squared \u2018displacement\u2019 of n, jtnj2 D N .\nFor the unitary ensemble, \u03b2 D 2, we exploit the symmetry of the exponential to be\naveraged in the phases \u03d5i and employ the analogue of (9) and find the characteristic function\nto take the form of a Toeplitz determinant,\nOP 2N,n(k) D det\n\u0012 Z 2pi\n0\nd\u03d5\n2pi\nei\u03d5(`\u2212m) e\u2212ik cos(n\u03d5)\n\u0013\n`, m D 1, . . . , N. (33)\nSecular determinants of random unitary matrices 3649\nThe remaining \u03d5 integral again yields Bessel functions and can be written as\nOP 2N,n(k) D det\n\u0012 C1X\nsD\u22121\nJjsj(k)(\u2212i)jsj\u03b4(` \u2212 m C ns)\n\u0013\n. (34)\nClearly, the number of non-zero elements of the N \u0002N determinant here incurred decreases\nas the order n of the trace tn in consideration grows. In particular, for n > N only the\ndiagonal elements are non-zero such that\nOP 2N,n(k) D J0(k)N for n > N.

(36)\nIntermediate values of n lead to the subdeterminants Tm obtained by cancelling the last\nN \u2212 m rows and columns of TN ,\nOP 2N,n(k) D T N\u2212n2 T 2n\u2212N1 for N > n > 12N\nOP 2N,n(k) D T N\u22122n3 T 3n\u2212N2 for 12N > n > 13N (37)\nand so forth. This can be seen as follows. Starting with N > n > 12N one checks that the\ndeterminant in (34) has non-vanishing elements residing only in the diagonal, J0(k)\u03b4(`\u2212m),\nand in two subdiagonals, \u2212iJ1(k)\u03b4(` \u2212 m C n). One moves the (1 C n)th row to become\nthe second, then the (1 C n)th column to become the second and thus isolates a 2 \u0002 2\nblock T2 D J0(k)2 C J1(k) in the upper left corner. One repeats this process by moving\nthe (2 C n)th rows and columns to become the fourth and so forth until one arrives at a\nblock diagonal determinant in which the 2 \u0002 2 block T2 and the 1 \u0002 1 block T1 D J0(k)\nappear N \u2212 n times and 2n \u2212 N times, respectively. The procedure for 12N > n > 13N is\nanalogous: one moves the (1C n)th and the (2C n)th row to become the second and third,\nrespectively, then does likewise to the (1 C n)th and (2 C n)th column and thus generates\nthe 3 \u0002 3 block T3 and so forth. As n decreases towards unity we meet all the\nOP 2N,n(k) D T N\u2212mnmC1 T (mC1)n\u2212Nm for N\/m > n > N\/(m C 1) (38)\nwith m D 1, . . . , N .\nSimplest to deal with is, of course, the case of the smallest non-trivial dimension, N D 2,\nand there we obtain\nOP 22,1(k) D J 20 (k) C J 21 (k) OP 22,2(k) D J 20 (k).

(40)\nNow we propose to show that the distribution P 2N,n of the nth trace behaves like a\nGaussian with respect to its moments jtnj2m for sufficiently low orders. To this end we\ndefine the functions\nQJm(k) D (\u2212ik)mJm(k) (41)\nwhich have the property (Abramowitz and Stegun 9.1.30 [21])\ni\nk\n\u2202\n\u2202k\nQJm(k) D QJm\u22121(k). (42)\n3650 F Haake et al\nThe Toeplitz determinant TN can then be rewritten as\nTN D det( QJm, QJm\u22121, . . .) with m D 0, . . . , N \u2212 1. (43)\nFrom this we find with (41) and (42) for l 6 N\u0012\n1\nk\n\u2202\n\u2202k\n\u0013l\nTN jkD0 D\n\u0012\u22121\n2\n\u0013l\n. (44)\nTo prove the foregoing identity we proceed as follows. Applying (1\/k)(\u2202\/\u2202k) once to\nTN we get a determinant differing from TN only in the last column where, according to\n(42), QJm\u2212NC1 ! QJm\u2212N . Now setting k D 0 and invoking QJm(0) D 0 for positive integer n\nwhile QJm(0) D (\u2212 12 i)m\/(\u2212m)! for m D 0, \u22121, \u22122, . . . we face a determinant with vanishing\nelements below the diagonal and thus equalling the product of its diagonal elements; among\nthese only the last, QJ1(0) D \u2212 12 i, differs from unity whereupon (44) is proven for ` D 1.\nIn the next step, ` D 2, TN is changed such that only the elements in the last two columns\nmay get their indices shifted; again setting k D 0 we are left with a 2 \u0002 2 determinant\nwhich yields (44) for ` D 2. In the `th step we get a sum of ` \u0002 ` determinants which is\nevidently independent of the dimension N for ` 6 N . Due to that independence we need\nnot pursue the non-trivial task of proving (44) for arbitrary ` 6 N < 1 but rather invoke\nthe much more easily proven result, to be established in the next section, that for N ! 1\nthe determinant TN is a Gaussian in k. It follows that for finite N the expansion of TN in\npowers of k2 coincides with that of exp(\u2212k2\/4) up to the N th power.

(51)\nFigure 3 reveals excellent agreement of the mean squared traces as computed for\nsamples of 4 \u0002 104 20 \u0002 20 matrices of the four ensembles considered with the analytical\npredictions. Note that for the Poisson circular ensemble jtnj2 equals the matrix size N ,\nwithout dependence on n. For small n the variance of traces decreases with the repulsion\nparameter \u03b2. The data for the symplectic ensemble are obtained with 2N -dimensional\nmatrices, which provide N different eigenvalues each.\nFigure 4 displays the similarly fine agreement of our analytical results for the densities\nP 2N,n with numerical data for sets of random matrices drawn from the circular unitary\nensemble. This demonstrates that for finite n and large N the distributions are Gaussians.\nWe have performed similar numerical studies for the orthogonal and symplectic ensembles,\nagain finding Gaussian marginal distributions for the traces of sufficiently large matrices.\nMoreover, in all cases studied, the distribution of the traces was isotropic, i.e. without any\nphase dependence.\nWe should add a word of intuitive explanation to the statistics of the traces for\nlarge dimensions N . The nth trace of a unitary matrix may be thought of as a random\nwalk in the complex plane, with each of the N steps of unit length and the ith step\nin a direction given as n times the ith eigenphase \u03d5i . These directions are mutually\nindependent and uniformly distributed for the Poissonian ensemble which fact explains\nthe independence of the characteristic function (32) of n and the ensuing first and second\nmoments, tn D 0, jtnj2 D N . In accordance with the central limit theorem the rescaled\ntraces tN\/\np\nN tend, with N ! 1, to have a Gaussian distribution of zero mean and unit\n3652 F Haake et al\nFigure 4.

Without such rescaling, the moments jtnj2m with m \u001c N differ from those of the\nGaussian defined by the first two moments only by corrections of relative order 1\/N .\nFor the circular ensembles with \u03b2 > 0 the phases \u03d5i display repulsion of degree \u03b2 such\nthat the directions of subsequent steps in the random walk mentioned are not independent.\nThe correlations between the phases cannot prevent near-Gaussian behaviour of the traces\ntn with n \u001c N , as is intuitive in view of the local character of the spectral correlations.\nMoreover, while the phases \u03d5i cover the interval [0, 2pi) uniformly once, their multiples n\u03d5i\ngo around that interval n times such that for n > 1 the phases n\u03d5i[mod(2pi)] may exhibit\naccidental close neighbourhoods of originally distant \u03d5i .\n4. Joint density of traces for large CUE matrices\nWe shall employ here a powerful theorem about determinants of Toeplitz matrices, due\noriginally to Szego\u00a8 and Kac and extended by Hartwig and Fisher [22], to find the marginal\nand joint distributions of the traces tn of CUE matrices in the limit of large dimension N . As\nour starting point we recall the identity (9) for the CUE average of a symmetric function of\nall N phases.

The only non-vanishing Fourier coefficients of ln f (\u03d5) D \u2212ik cos n\u03d5\nare l\u0006n D \u2212ik\/2 whereupon we get the Gaussian anticipated in the previous section,\nOP 2N,n(k) D e\u2212nk\n2\/4 () P 2N,n(t) D\n1\nnpi\ne\u2212jt j\n2\/n for N \u001d 1. (55)\nNo more difficult to obtain is the joint density of the first n traces\nP\n\u03b2\nN(t1, . . . , tn) D\nnY\nmD1\n\u03b42\n\u0012\ntm \u2212\nNX\niD1\neim\u03d5i\n\u0013\n(56)\nsince its Fourier transform OP 2N(k1, . . . , kn) is once more of the form (52) with\nf (\u03d5) D exp\n\u0012\n\u2212 12 i\nnX\nmD1\n(km e\n\u2212im\u03d5 C k\u0003m eim\u03d5)\n\u0013\n. (57)\nThe non-vanishing Fourier coefficients of the logarithm of that latter function are lm D\n\u2212ikm\/2, l\u2212m D \u2212ik\u0003m\/2 with m D 1, . . . , n. The theorem (54) thus yields, for N \u001d n,\nOP 2N(k1, . . . , kn) D exp\n\u0012\n\u2212\nnX\nmD1\nmjkmj2\/4\n\u0013\n() P 2N(t1, . . . , tn)\nD 1\nn!pin\nexp\n\u0012\n\u2212\nnX\nmD1\njtmj2\/m\n\u0013\n(58)\ni.e. the product of the marginal distributions of the first n traces. The result generalizes\nin an obvious way to the joint density of an arbitrary set of finite-order traces. We thus\nconclude that in the limit N ! 1 the finite-order traces are statistically independent and\nall have Gaussian distributions.\nWe can now briefly comment on the conditions of applicability of the Hartwig\u2013Fisher\ntheorem given above. The first two of them are clearly fulfilled here since i ln f (\u03d5) as given\nby (57) is real, continuous, and periodic. The third and fourth conditions are met since the\nderivative f 0(\u03d5) D P1mD\u22121 imfm eim\u03d5 is square integrable (trivially indeed since i ln f (\u03d5)\nis a finite Fourier series); in particular, f 0(\u03d5) obeys Parseval\u2019s identity,\n1X\nmD\u22121\njmj2jfmj2 D\nZ 2pi\n0\njf 0(\u03d5)j2 d\u03d5 D pi\nnX\nmD1\nm2jkmj2 < 1. (59)\nSince jmjjfmj2 6 jmj2jfmj2 it follows that\nP1\nmD\u22121 jmjjfmj2 < 1, i.e. the validity of\ncondition (iii).\nFinally, we invoke Cauchy\u2019s inequality in\n1X\nmD\u22121\njfmj D jf0j C\n1X\nm6D0\n\f\f\f\f 1m\n\f\f\f\fjmfmj 6 jf0j C \u0012 1X\nm6D0\n\f\f\f\f 1m\n\f\f\f\f2\u00131\/2\u0012 1X\nm6D0\njmfmj2\n\u00131\/2\n. (60)\nUpon using (59) and the convergence of P1m6D0 1\/jmj2 we verify condition (iv).\nFor finite dimension the independence as well as the Gaussian character of the traces\nare only approximate. For sets of traces both of these properties tend to get lost as the sum\nof the orders of the traces in a set increases. In particular, since all traces tn are uniquely\ndetermined by the N real eigenphases, only 12N traces can be independent.\nPreliminary numerical studies suggest that the finite-order traces might be similarly\nindependent and Gaussian for the COE and the CSE. For the CPE, of course, the\nindependence holds trivially.\n3654 F Haake et al\n5. Remarks on the distributions of coefficients of secular polynomials\nAs we have just seen the first few traces t1, t2, . . . of large unitary matrices drawn from any\nof the circular ensembles display no noticeable correlations. It follows that the coefficients\na1, a2, . . . must bear strong mutual correlations simply since an can be expressed in terms\nof the first n traces through Newton\u2019s formulae (25). One must therefore expect that the\nexplicit form of the marginal and joint distributions of the an are hard to come by. An\nexception is provided by a1, the marginal distribution of which is trivially related to that of\nthe first trace since a1 D t1.\nA slightly less trivial result may be obtained for the distribution P(a2) of the second\ncoefficient. Since a2 D 12 (t21 \u2212 t2) we may invoke the CUE joint distribution (58) of the\nfirst two traces to get\nP(a2) D\nr\n2e\npi3\nZ 2\n0\ndxp\nx(2 \u2212 x) exp\n\u0012\n\u22121\nx\n\u2212 ja2j2x\n\u0013\n. (61)\nA saddle-point approximation to the foregoing integral immediately reveals that P(a2)\ndecays exponentially for large a2. Proceeding similarly one may combine Newton\u2019s\nformulae with the joint distribution of the traces to get the marginal and joint distributions\nof the first few an, with decreasingly compact and enjoyable results.\nFigure 5 presents the distributions of some moduli janj as obtained numerically from\n105 CUE matrices of the size 10 \u0002 10. For n D 2 these numerical data agree well with\nthe distribution 2pi ja2jP(a2) according to (61). All of those curves grow linearly out of the\norigin with a slope increasing with the index n of the coefficient an. On the other hand, all\nof these distributions but the first are characterized by a long exponential tail. The latter\noriginates from the convolution type integrals which combine the densities of the traces to\nthose of the coefficients; it contrasts with the Gaussian tail of the distribution of the first\ncoefficient. The qualitative features just outlined for the CUE are shared by the distributions\nP(an) for the other canonical ensembles.\n6. Comparison with a dynamical system\nWe propose here to examine how far our results on distributions of the coefficients an\nand traces tn of matrices, drawn from the canonical circular ensembles, are applicable to\ndynamical systems. Choosing the familiar model of the periodically kicked top [3, 23] we\nwork with a Floquet operator of the form\nF D exp\n\u0012\n\u2212i kx\n2j C 1J\n2\nx \u2212 ipxJx\n\u0013\nexp\n\u0012\n\u2212i ky\n2j C 1J\n2\ny \u2212 ipyJy\n\u0013\n\u0002 exp\n\u0012\n\u2212i kz\n2j C 1J\n2\nz \u2212 ipzJz\n\u0013\n. (62)\nThis involves the components of an angular momentum operator Jx , Jy , Jz which satisfy\nstandard commutation relations, [Jx, Jy] D iJz etc. The quantum number j fixes J2 D\nj (j C 1) and the size of the Hilbert space, N D 2j C 1.\nFor generic values of the parameters kx , ky , kz and px , py , pz the corresponding classical\ndynamics is chaotic and there is no geometric nor anti-unitary symmetry left [23]. All\npreviously studied statistical properties of the quasi-energy spectrum and the eigenvectors\nwere found to be remarkably faithful to the predictions of the CUE [3]. On the other\nhand, when the parameters ky and py (or, instead, kx and px) are set to zero, an anti-unitary\nsymmetry under time reversal appears, and in this case the spectral and eigenvector statistics\nSecular determinants of random unitary matrices 3655\nFigure 5.

Data are averaged over 20 000 different\nFloquet matrices of the structure (6.1) as described in the\ntext.\nwere found as of the COE type. We shall refer to the two variants of the model as to the\nunitary and orthogonal top, respectively.\nBefore presenting our data for the traces tn and the secular coefficients an of various tops\na word of caution is in order. Previous statistical analyses of tops were made for spectrally\nlocal quantities such as low-order correlations of the level density, the distribution of nearest-\nneighbour spacings, or for components of eigenvectors; what distinguishes these quantities is\na certain self-averaging character. A single Floquet matrix of large dimension N provides a\nsufficient data basis to extract reliable means or even distributions from. Now, the sequence\nof the traces tn and that of the secular coefficients an are not in any way self-averaging since\nsuch a sequence with 1 6 n 6 12N stands for a whole quasi-energy spectrum and therefore\nchanges in a system specific manner when control parameters are varied. Consequently, it\nwould not make sense to compare such a sequence for an individual Floquet matrix with\nthe means calculated here for the various circular ensembles. We must rather ask whether\nan ensemble of Floquet matrices of the type (62), defined by a whole set of values for the\nvarious control parameters, is faithful to the prediction based on the circular ensemble of\nrandom matrices of the same symmetry class. It is in this sense that we have undertaken\nthe comparison to follow.\nFigure 6 shows the n dependence of the variances of the traces (circles) and of the\ncoefficients (triangles) for orthogonal tops. The order of the characteristic polynomial was\ntaken as N D 41 by choosing j D 20. Data from 20 000 matrices were gathered by\npicking ky , kz from intervals of length 3 around 10 and py , pz from [3pi\/8, 5pi\/8], all with\nindependent box distributions. These intervals were chosen so as to secure classical chaos\nand to avoid geometric symmetries. The agreement with the COE is obviously satisfactory.\nAnalogous data for unitary tops are presented in figure 7. The agreement with the\nCUE predictions is acceptable in the sense that there is no doubt about the universality\nclass. However, system specific behaviour is clearly visible for low-order traces and even\n3656 F Haake et al\nFigure 7. As in figure 6 for unitary tops. Curves\ndenote the CUE results.\nFigure 8. As in figure 6 for symplectic tops.\nAverage over 2000 matrices as described in the\ntext. Curves denote CSE results.\nin all secular coefficients. Qualitatively, such deviations from random-matrix theory are\nnot unexpected since low-order traces do contain primarily system specific information\nretrievable from short periodic orbits and since the an even for large n contain low-order\ntraces as expressed in Newton\u2019s formulae.\nSymplectic tops can also be constructed by securing an anti-unitary symmetry T with\nT 2 D \u22121 and avoiding geometric symmetries [3].

A set of 2000 matrices with\nj D 39.5 and coupling constants ki drawn at random from a hypercube of length 0.4 near\n10 gives data shown in figure 8. The agreement with the CSE is better than could be hoped\nfor.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Nils Lehmann for helpful cooperation and Pragya Shukla for\nfirst efforts to calculate the mean squared secular coefficients for the COE and the CSE.\nFinancial support by the Sonderforschungsbereich \u2018Unordnung und gro\u00dfe Fluktuationen\u2019\nder Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft is gratefully acknowledged.\nSecular determinants of random unitary matrices 3657\nAppendix A. Differential equation for the generating function\nLet us recall the heuristic way we first approached the mean squared secular coefficients (19),\n(23), and (24). After deriving the Pfaffians (18) and (21) we applied an algebraic computer\nprogram to evaluate the janj2 for small dimensions N and then proceeded analytically\nto n D 1, 2 and arbitrary N . We thank N Lehmann for the computer work and also\nfor his intuition in proposing (23) with us. Having eventually proposed (19) as well we\nspeculatively extrapolated to the general form (24) for arbitrary positive \u03b2.\nTo prepare for the proof of (24) we observe the equivalence to the recursion relation\n(n C 1)\n\u0012\n1 C \u03b2\n2\n(N \u2212 n \u2212 1)\n\u0013\njanC1j2 D (N \u2212 n)\n\u0012\n1 C n\u03b2\n2\n\u0013\njanj2 (A1)\nwith ja0j2 D 1. Multiplying (A1) by xn, using (x\u2202\/\u2202x)xn D nxn, and summing from n D 0\nto n D N \u2212 1 we obtain the differential equation (25), the polynomial solution of which\nwith P \u03b2N(x) D 1 generates the mean squared secular coefficients. A few elementary steps\nwill now yield the validity of the differential equation.\nWe start from the definition (4) of the generating function, setting \u03bb D x, \u00b5 D 1 and\ntake the derivative with respect to x,\n\u2202P (x)\n\u2202x\nD \u2212\n\u001c NX\niD1\n1\nei\u03d5i \u2212 x\n\u001d\n(A2)\nwhere the angular brackets denote an average with the whole integrand of (A2) as the\nweight. On the other hand, taking the derivative with respect to \u00b5 before setting \u00b5 D 1 and\nexploiting the invariance of the N -fold phase integral under a constant shift of all phases\nwe get\nx\n\u2202P (x)\n\u2202x\nD \u2212\n\u001c NX\niD1\n1\ne\u2212i\u03d5i \u2212 1\n\u001d\n.
