The Kramers activation process lies\nwithin this class of problems [7]. Despite its importance,\nthe problem of activation cannot be regarded as solved. On\nthe theoretical side, important steps towards the solution\nhave been taken in the regime of zero-noise intensities.\nThey predict the escape to take place in a ballistic manner\nalong a most probable escape path (MPEP) that can be\nobtained from an auxiliary Hamiltonian system [8\u201314].\nThe same picture still applies even for escape at short\ntimes (i.e., before quasiequilibrium has been established)\n[15]. More recently it has been established [16] that finite\nnoise does more than just changing the prefactor of the\nexponential. It causes the system to follow a path that\ndiffers from the zero-noise theoretical MPEP.\nThe activation problem has also been extensively\nstudied numerically, in particular, using Monte Carlo\nsimulations. However, even for simple systems, the simu-\nlation time grows exponentially with decreasing noise\nintensity. Consequently, the really interesting range of\nnoise intensities, i.e., small enough for valid comparisons\nto be made with theoretical predictions, has in practice\nbeen inaccessible to numerical experiments. Intensive\nefforts are therefore being made to find ways of speeding\nup the simulations [17\u201319]. In [17] the probability distri-\nbution for the system is built up iteratively. In this way,\nthe shift of singularities in the probability distribution\nand oscillation of the probability at the boundary due to\nfinite noise intensity have been observed. These features\nare consistent with the predicted shift of optimal paths\ndue to the finiteness of the noise intensity. However,0031-9007=04=92(2)=020601(4)$22.50 \uf6d9to address this question we need numerical approaches\nwhich yield, not the probability distributions, but rather\nthe actual paths followed by the dynamics of the system\nof interest. Simulation techniques based on dynamic im-\nportance sampling (DIMS) were proposed in [18] for\none-dimensional dynamical systems to study dynamics\nin the limit of very small noise intensity. DIMS aims to\naccelerate Monte Carlo integrations by adding an appro-\npriately chosen biasing field to the equations of motion,\nwhich remain stochastic in nature. Standard techniques\nare then used to relate Monte Carlo results in the presence\nof the bias to the statistical observables of the original\nsystem.\nExtensions of DIMS to higher-dimensional systems\n(like those one commonly encounters when dealing\nwith nonequilibrium processes) are not straightforward.\nAn earlier biasing technique, introduced in [19] for both\none- and two-dimensional systems, was found incapable\nof detecting either the shift of the escape path [16] or\nsaddle point avoidance [20], both of which had been\npredicted theoretically. Moreover, in the presence of sin-\ngularities, a bad choice of bias might hide impor-\ntant physical features of the system of interest. Note\nthat other numerical approaches, like the umbrella sam-\npling technique [21], are not appropriate for nonequilib-\nrium systems.\nIn this Letter we propose a robust generalization of\nDIMS that is, in principle, valid for an arbitrary number\nof dimensions. The aim is to reveal finite noise features in\nthe vicinity of the MPEP, accelerating the simulation by\nexploitation of well-established zero-noise-limit theoreti-\ncal results. We apply this technique to the investigation of\nescape in multidimensional nonequilibrium systems for\nvery small but finite noise intensities, thereby accessing a\nrange far beyond anything investigated previously. As we\nshow, the predicted shift of the optimal path due to the\nfiniteness of the noise is clearly resolved and turns out to2004 The American Physical Society 020601-1\nP H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending16 JANUARY 2004VOLUME 92, NUMBER 2We first describe the problem for a generic nonlinear\nsystem under the influence of noise\n_x \u0001 f\u0002x\u0003 \u0004 \u0004\u0002t\u0003; (1)\nh\u0004\u0002t\u0003i \u0001 0 h\u0004\u0002t\u0003\u0004\u0002s\u0003i \u0001 \b\t\u0002t\u0007 s\u0003: (2)\nHere x represents a vector of coordinates, f\u0002x\u0003 is a non-\nlinear function, and \u0004\u0002t\u0003 is a family of zero-mean un-\ncorrelated noise processes of intensity \b.

The\nfunction S evolves along the characteristics of (5) accord-\ning to _S \u0001 12p2. Being nondecreasing along trajectories\nand differentiable almost everywhere, the function S can\nbe considered as a nonequilibrium potential for the sys-\ntem [23\u201326]. It is known from the theory of dynamical\nsystems that S\u0002x; t\u0003 can be a multivalued function of\nposition in the coordinate space [23,25,27,28]. In this\ncase, more than one trajectory solution of (5) reaches\nthe same point in coordinate space. In the limit \b! 0,\nonly the least action Smin is relevant, and all trajectories\ncorresponding to higher values of S are exponentially\ndisadvantaged. Escape takes place along the least action\ntrajectory with overwhelming probability in the limit\n\b ! 0. This is the MPEP, and the action calculated along\nit is the \u2018\u2018activation energy.\u2019\u2019 Regions of coordinate space\nreached by different families of optimal paths are sepa-\nrated by switching lines (SL) [11,12,29]. A trajectory\nceases to be optimal after crossing a switching line. For\nthis reason, the most probable escape path can touch the\nSL only asymptotically. Because the SL reaches the cycle\nasymptotically [12], the only possible optimal escape020601-2trajectories are heteroclinic paths connecting the initial\nstate to the saddle cycle in infinite time.\nTo calculate the effect of a finite small \b \u0001 0 in this\npicture, a calculation of the next-to-the-leading order in\nthe WKB expansion is performed.

The\nposition of the switching line is now defined as S1\b \u0001 S2\b,\nwhere the indices 1; 2 refer to two different trajectories\nreaching the same point in the coordinate space [17]. The\nmodified switching line does not touch the cycle asymp-\ntotically but hits it at a definite position. As a conse-\nquence, heteroclinic trajectories are no longer optimal\nand optimal escape follows a path different than MPEP.\nTo test these ideas, we propose an extension of DIMS\n[18,19] to the multidimensional case. It is suitable for\nunraveling features of the topology close to the optimal\nescape path in the limit of small but finite noise intensity.\nThe method is applicable to a system characterized by a\nstable attractor with a sizable basin of attraction, where\nescape takes place via a large fluctuation.\nFor a given dynamical system, we initially set the\nsystem close to the stable attractor and integrate the exact\nequations of motion using a standard SDE (stochastic\ndifferential equation) integrator: for the examples shown\nbelow, we used the Heun integrator [30]. We also set a\nboundary at some distance from the stable attractor: this\nboundary has nothing to do with the boundary of the\nbasin of attraction, but it defines when we switch from\nstandard SDE integration to DIMS integration. Although\nthe final result does not appear to depend on the boundary\nchoice, nevertheless the boundary ought to be chosen on\nsome rational basis: we require that the boundary should\nbe fairly easily reached by the dynamical system when\nusing straight SDE integration, but also that this event\nshould not be too probable. In practice, a reasonable\nboundary could be, e.g., a circle centered on the stable\nattractor, with a radius of a few\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\n\b\np\n. This choice is\nreproducing the diffusive dynamics in the vicinity of020601-2\nP H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending16 JANUARY 2004VOLUME 92, NUMBER 2the stable state. When the system hits the boundary, we\nswitch to the DIMS integrator: from the above discussion,\nwe know that the SDE\n_x \u0001 f\u0002x\u0003 \u0004 \u0004\u0002t\u0003\nmaps onto the Hamiltonian equation (6), so we switch to\nthe integration of\n_x \u0001 f\u0002x\u0003 \u0004 p\u0002x\u0003 \u0004 \u0004\u0002t\u0003; (9)\nwhere p\u0002x\u0003 is the momentum conjugated with x as ob-\ntained from the MPEP and \u0004\u0002t\u0003 is the DIMS stochastic\ncomponent. It is clear that in more than one dimension the\nprobability of being exactly on the MPEP during each\nintegration time step is negligible, but the idea is, never-\ntheless, that we should use in the integration of (9) the\nvalue of p\u0002x\u0003 which \u2018\u2018pulls\u2019\u2019 the escape tube towards the\nboundary. This is achieved by linearizing the Hamilton\nequations near the MPEP and using the p\u0002x\u0003 that keeps\nthe system on the stable manifold of the MPEP. A step of\nthe scheme is explained in Fig. 1. Consider point A in the\ncoordinate space. The momentum p\u0002x\u0003 to be used in\nEq. (9) is calculated in the following way: point A\u000b in\nthe extended phase space which has the same x coordinate\nas A, and lies on the stable manifold of the MPEP, is\nlocated. The momentum of point A\u000b is then used as p\u0002x\u0003 in\n(9). The integration scheme is interrupted and reset if the\ntrajectory leaves a small neighborhood of the MPEP (size\nof a few\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\n\b\np ).\nWe now consider two explicit examples of the applica-\ntion of this algorithm. First, we consider the inverted\nVan der Pol oscillator (IVDP). It is characterized by the\npresence of an unstable cycle with a stable point at its\ncenter. DIMS is used here to study transitions from the\nstable state to the limit cycle. The IVDP system is de-\nscribed by the following set of equations:\u2126 \n\u03b3 \nx \np \nA \nA* \nFIG. 1 (color online).

The dashed lines represent, respectively, the coordinate\nspace x and the momentum space p. A is a point in the\ncoordinate space; A\u000b is the corresponding point on the stable\nmanifold of \u001a as required by the integration procedure.\n020601-3_x \u0001 y; _y \u0001 \u0007x\u0007 2\u0018\u00021\u0007 x2\u0003y\u0004 \u0003\u0003\u0003\bp \u0004\u0002t\u0003: (10)\nHere x and y are dynamical variables and \u0004\u0002t\u0003 is a white\nGaussian process of unit intensity. The DIMS simulation\nhave been performed for a range of intensities running\nbetween 10\u00075 and 10\u00072. The results are shown in Fig. 2\nfor two different noise intensities. The agreement between\nthe theoretical and experimental escape paths at finite\nnoise intensities is seen to be excellent. The shift in the\noptimal path is dramatic, leading to a marked change in\nthe point where it hits the cycle.\nAs a second example, we consider the harmonically\ndriven overdamped Duffing oscillator\n_x \u0001 x\u0007 x3 \u0004 A sin\u0002!t\u0003 \u0004 \u0003\u0003\u0003\bp \u0004\u0002t\u0003: (11)\nHere x is the dynamical coordinate, A and ! are the\namplitude and the frequency of the external driving,\nand \u0004 is a white Gaussian process of unit intensity. The\nparameters A and ! are chosen to be in the nonperturba-\ntive, nonadiabatic regime. The dynamics of this system is\ncharacterized by two stable limit cycles separated by an\nunstable limit cycle. In the presence of noise, the system\ncan fluctuate from one stable cycle to the other. Some\nsimulation results are shown in Fig. 3. The experimental\ntrajectory follows closely the heteroclinic path when it is\nfar from the stable and unstable cycles. As the system\napproaches the unstable cycle, however, diffusion be-\ncomes important and the escape then runs along the finite\nnoise escape path calculated using finite noise corrections.\nExperiments with different noise intensities (not shown)\nreveal an increase of the shift with noise intensity.\nIn conclusion, we have introduced a highly efficient\nway of performing numerical simulations, based on the\nidea of taking the momentum so as to stay on the stable\nmanifold. It is applicable to a large class of dynamical\nsystems.
