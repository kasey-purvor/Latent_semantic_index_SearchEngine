[DOI: 10.1063\/1.1805175]\nConjugated polymers are of increasing interest as new\nmaterials for electronic applications, offering the potential\nfor low fabrication cost, easy processing, and flexibility. Or-\nganic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), field-effect transistors\n(FETs), photodiodes, and solar cells are all applications un-\nder intense study and first products are already emerging.\nOne of the limitations for the utilization of such organic\nsemiconductors is that they have relatively poor carrier trans-\nport properties in terms both of absolute mobility and with\nrespect to the balance between hole and electron mobility.\nLow mobilities can limit practical applications, for instance,\nof OLEDs in passive matrix addressed displays due to low\ncurrent densities in the space-charge-limited current regime,\nand unbalanced transport can reduce OLED-based display\nemission efficiency. Low mobility also impacts on switching\nspeed in FETs and on solar cell efficiency, and again unbal-\nanced transport has additional drawbacks in both of these\napplications.\nIn general, electron transport in conjugated polymers is\nmuch worse than hole transport, and tends to be highly\ndispersive, with no clear transit time observed in time-of-\nflight (ToF) photocurrent measurements.1 Better electron\ntransport polymers are, therefore, much needed in order to\nachieve the desired combination of enhanced and balanced\ncarrier transport. We report here a study that reveals unex-\npected promise for poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a ma-\nterial with both good electron and hole transport. P3HT has\nbeen widely studied in the past and is well known as being\nan effective hole transport polymer, with higher hole mobil-\nity than many other conjugated polymers, including the\npoly(phenylenevinylene)s.2 Initially, however, rather low\nhole mobilities were reported for regiorandom P3HT.3 How-\never, when head-to-tail regioregularly substituted P3HT be-\ncame available, the hole mobilities were found to be dramati-\ncally improved.4\u20136 The increase in mobility was related to\nside-chain-induced self-organization into a well-ordered two-\ndimensional lamellar structure.2 In contrast, electron trans-\nport has not been reported up to now in P3HT, most probably\nbecause electrons are heavily trapped. Molecular oxygen im-\npurities have been proposed as one possible trap,7 but little\nhas been done to systematically address the issue. The exten-\nsive literature for P3HT highlights the importance of both\nstructural and chemical influences on transport\nproperties.\nIn this letter, we present results concerning carrier trans-\nport in regioregular (RR)-P3HT, obtained using ToF photo-\ncurrent measurements on single-layer device structures. The\nRR-P3HT used in this work was synthesized and carefully\npurified by Merck NBSC Ltd. The polymer number- and\nweight-average molecular weights were 2.83104\nand 4.43104, respectively, and its regioregularity was mea-\nsured to be greater than 96% by proton nuclear magnetic\nresonance. Importantly, the concentration of residual cata-\nlysts such as Ni and Mg was determined to be less than\n10 mg\/g after purification. Films of RR-P3HT were spin\ncoated from chloroform solutions s30 mg\/mld onto indium\ntin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates. The ToF test struc-\ntures were then completed by thermal evaporation of a\nshadow-masked, aluminum top contact, at a typical pressure\nof 10\u22126 mbar. ToF transients were measured at 20\u201370 V ap-\nplied biases under pulsed (7 ns) illumination through the ITO\nelectrode. Measurements were performed at 532 nm (where\nthe absorption coefficient of RR-P3HT is a=23105 cm\u22121)\nand 355 nm (a=33104 cm\u22121) using the frequency-doubled\nand frequency-tripled outputs of a Nd:YAG laser (Quantel),\nrespectively. No difference was observed in the electron mo-\nbility or its field\/temperature dependence at these two exci-\ntation wavelengths. The resulting photocurrent was detected\nwith a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 3052) and the\ncarrier type under study was selected by changing the sign of\nthe applied bias. The transit time ttr for the arrival of carriers\nat the collecting electrode is related to the carrier mobility m\nvia the relation\nm = d\/sEttrd , s1d\nwhere E is the applied electric field and d the thickness of the\nRR-P3HT film. The samples were stored and measured in\nvacuo. Measurements on films of different thickness (1.2,\n1.4, 1.7, and 2.8 \u00b5m) showed that the observed mobilities\nwere thickness independent. This demonstrates that the pho-\ntocurrents are not range limited, but indeed reflect the drift of\nthe carrier sheet across the entire sample.

The data are plotted in both double-logarithmic (main\nplot) and double-linear (inset) representations. The hole\nphotocurrent transients are highly dispersive. They are char-\nacterized by temporal decays that show a \u201cknee\u201d only in the\ndouble-logarithmic plot. Nevertheless, the transit time sttrd\ncan still be estimated from the intersection point at which the\nasymptotes to the log-log plot (pre- and post-knee) cross; this\npoint is indicated by an arrow in Fig. 1. The mobility of\nthe positive carriers that we deduce, namely mh\n<3310\u22124 cm2\/V s at E\u00f8105 V\/cm, is very similar to that\nfound in previous ToF measurements on RR-P3HT.4\u20138\nFigure 2 shows a corresponding typical RT electron cur-\nrent transient recorded with a reversed polarity field (to col-\nlect electrons) of amplitude E=1.043105 V\/cm. The data\nare again plotted in both double-logarithmic (main plot) and\ndouble-linear (inset) representations. The electron photocur-\nrent transients are slightly less dispersive than those for\nholes, but again, the characteristic knee in the double-\nlogarithmic plot is needed to estimate ttr. As expected, loga-\nrithmic slopes for all the transients studied have values less\nthan 1 and greater than 1 before and after ttr, respectively.9\nWe also note that the collected charge was less than 6% of\nthe sample capacitor charge in all cases, so that we could be\nconfident that we are indeed working in a regime in which\nthe electric field across the samples can be assumed constant\n[as required for Eq. (1)]. The electron mobility then deduced\nfrom Eq. (1) is of order 1.5310\u22124 cm2\/V s and is thus\nwithin a factor of approximately 2 of the hole mobility.\nFigure 3 shows the field dependence of the RT electron\nand hole mobilities deduced from a sequence of ToF experi-\nments performed with different bias fields. The mobility data\nare plotted as a function of the square root of the bias field\n(corrected for the built-in voltage), in accordance with the\nexpectations of the Poole\u2013Frenkel model. This square-root\nfield dependence is often seen for molecular materials.10\nHere, however, for E\u00f8105 V\/cm, we find a very weak field\ndependence for both electron and hole transport: The RR-\nP3HT hole mobility is <3310\u22124 cm2\/V s and the electron\nmobility <1.5310\u22124 cm2\/V s. For E\u0142105 V\/cm we note\nthat both the electron and hole mobilities show a negative\nfield dependence. Similar behavior is discussed in detail in\nRefs. 4, 5, and 8.\nThe influence of traps on charge transport depends on\ntheir energy relative to the transport states of the material.\nThis is one of the reasons low-ionization-potential sIpd ma-\nterials have found widespread use as organic hole\ntransporters.11 For RR-P3HT the typical ionization potential\nreported in the literature, Ip<4.8 eV,12 is quite low and good\nhole transport can be expected, as has already been\nreported.4\u20137 The electron affinity sEad for RR-P3HT is Ea\n<2.9 eV. This low value for Ea means that the electron\ntransport states are expected to lie close to typical impurity\nelectron trap states that are often encountered in these\nmaterials.13 This suggests at first glance that RR-P3HT does\nnot have the potential to be a good electron transport mate-\nrial, indeed electron transport has not been reported previ-\nFIG. 1.

However, from our measurements we have found that\nelectron transport in RR-P3HT is comparable to the highest\nreported electron mobility values for other conjugated\npolymers, such as poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-\nco-benzothiadiazole).1 This large and field-independent mo-\nbility indicates that our RR-P3HT has excellent purity and\nchemical\/structural regularity. The high and balanced posi-\ntive and negative charge carrier mobilities that we have ob-\nserved for RR-P3HT have not been previously reported for\nany other conjugated polymer. Our observations are compat-\nible with recent theoretical calculations, which indicate that\nsimilar charge transport characteristics are expected for elec-\ntrons and holes in conjugated oligomers.14\nIn order to investigate microscopic mechanisms for the\nelectron transport in RR-P3HT, we performed ToF photocur-\nrent measurements for electrons as a function of temperature.\nFigure 4 shows the field dependence of the electron mobility\nin P3HT (plotted in Poole\u2013Frenkel format) as a function of\ntemperature. The electron mobility shows a relatively weak\ntemperature dependence: It is found to increase from <9\n310\u22125 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 at 240 K to <5310\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 at\n340 K. The relatively weak temperature dependence is in-\ndicative of a low degree of energetic disorder for the trans-\nport active sites, consistent with a high degree of purity and\nchemical regularity. Nondispersive charge transport data in\nconjugated polymers has previously been analyzed with em-\npirical models such as the Gaussian disorder model (GDM)\nand variants10 to yield values of empirical parameters be-\nlieved to be indicative of the degree of disorder. In the\npresent case, it has not been possible to analyze the data\npresented in Fig. 4 with the GDM with any confidence be-\ncause of the small range of the mobility data (electron mo-\nbilities vary by less than one order of magnitude over a tem-\nperature range of 100 K), and because of the relatively large\nuncertainty in the mobility values arising from the strongly\ndispersive transport that we measure. However the field and\ntemperature dependence of the electron mobility in RR-\nP3HT is reminiscent of other high mobility hole transporting\npolymers, suggesting a common mechanism.15\nThe relatively high electron and hole mobilities and bal-\nanced transport that we have observed in P3HT are expected\nto be important for a range of molecular electronic device\napplications. Although the photoluminescence quantum effi-\nciency (QE) for P3HT is low, we anticipate that the compa-\nrable electron and hole mobilities will offer increased QE for\nRR-P3HT-based LEDs. High and balanced charge carrier\nmobilities are also an essential requirement for the construc-\ntion of electrically pumped laser diodes11 and offer potential\nfor fast switching FETs, both of which areas are of major\ninterest for technological applications. In the latter context,\nwe note that the absence of n-type transport in RR-P3HT\nFETs may in fact result from the high injection barrier for\nelectrons and not from the intrinsic charge transport proper-\nties of the material.16 Furthermore, unbalanced mobilities in\nbulk hetero-junction solar cells may limit performance\nthrough space-charge buildup and recombination limitations\non the short circuit current and fill factor.17 The high RT\nmobility presented here for holes in RR-P3HT suggests that\nthe combination of RR-P3HT with fullerenes could offer\nmore balanced transport within the blend and thus improve\nthe polymer-fullerene device performance.\nThe experimental results presented provide a strong\nindication that ambipolar and balanced charge transport can\nbe an intrinsic property of pure conjugated polymers. The\nRR-P3HT that we have studied exhibits good electron\nas well as hole transport with largely field-independent\nmobilities and only weak temperature dependence. The elec-\ntron and hole mobilities obtained from RT ToF measure-\nments sE\u00f8105 V\/cmd were <1.5310\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 and\n<3310\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, respectively. Such well-balanced,\nambipolar carrier transport offers the potential for RR-P3HT\nto find widespread use as the active organic semiconductor in\na range of electronic applications.\nThe authors thank BP International for financial support.\n1A.
