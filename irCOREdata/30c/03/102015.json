MONTALDI & R.M. ROBERTS\nIntroduction\nIn the theory of molecular spectra a molecule is treated as a system of point particles, the atomic nuclei\nand electrons, interacting through conservative forces. The resulting mechanical system is impossible\nto \u2018solve\u2019, even for very simple molecules. For example the water molecule, H2O has 3 nuclei and 10\nelectrons, and hence a 39 dimensional configuration space. Considerable simplification is achieved by\napplying the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in which the electron motion responds adiabatically\nto that of the nuclei (see eg [15]). The result is a model for the nuclei alone, interacting via a potential\nenergy function which incorporates the effects of the electrons.\nAlthough considerably simpler than the original model, H2O now has 3 particles and a 9 dimen-\nsional configuration space, understanding the dynamics of the resulting system is still highly non-\ntrivial. The classical approach to computing and interpreting molecular spectra is based on a further\napproximation which effectively decouples the vibrational motion of the molecule from the rotational\nmotion. For the rotational motion the molecule is assumed to maintain a constant shape, namely\nthat of a stable equilibrium position, and to rotate as a rigid body. Both the classical and quantum\nmechanics of rigid bodies are well understood and the latter gives reasonably accurate predictions\nof spectra for many \u2018rigid\u2019 molecules. The classical mechanics of a rigid body includes among its\nfeatures motions in which the body rotates about a stationary axis. Such motions are examples of rel-\native equilibria. Provided the three principal moments of inertia of the body are all different there are\nprecisely 6 of these relative equilibria for each non-zero value of the angular momentum, one rotating\nin each direction about each of the 3 principal axes of the inertia tensor.\nFor a molecule, a relative equilibrium is a motion during which it rotates steadily about a fixed\naxis, which we call the dynamical axis, while the shape remains constant. In this paper we describe\nan approach to finding families of relative equilibria of molecules which bifurcate from equilibrium\nconfigurations as the total angular momentum is increased from zero. We do this for the full Born-\nOppenheimer model for the motion of the nuclei. For example, we show that if an equilibrium con-\nfiguration has distinct principal moments of inertia then, as one would expect, the 6 relative equilibria\nof the rigid body approximation persist to this model, together with their stabilities, and these are the\nonly relative equilibria near the equilibrium configuration (Corollary 3.2).\nMore interesting is the case of molecules near equilibria with either two or all three principal\nmoments of inertia equal, which in the molecular spectroscopy literature are called symmetric top\nand spherical top molecules, respectively. In the rigid body approximation symmetric top molecules\nhave a whole circle of relative equilibria with dynamical axes in the plane spanned by the two principal\naxes of the inertia tensor with equal moments of inertia. They also have two isolated relative equilibria\nwhich are rotations about the other principal axis. Similarly the spherical top molecules have a sphere\nof relative equilibria. Indeed in this case every trajectory of the rigid body approximation is a relative\nequilibrium. We show that typically in each of these cases only a finite number of these relative\nequilibria persist in the Born-Oppenheimer model, including the two isolated relative equilibria of\nsymmetric top molecules. In Section 3 of this paper we show how to calculate these for specific\nmolecules, or rather for specific equilibria of specific molecules: a molecule can have more than one\nequilibrium, some stable some unstable (as noted in Example 1.4), and our analysis applies to each\none separately.\nFor symmetric top and spherical top molecules the degeneracy of the rigid body approximation is\ncaused by symmetries. The Born-Oppenheimer model is invariant under the action of two groups, the\ngroup O(3) of all orthogonal rotations and reflections of R3 and the group \u03a3 of all permutations of\nidentical nuclei. We define the symmetry group \u0393 of an equilibrium configuration to be the subgroup of\nO(3)\u00d7\u03a3 which fixes each nucleus. Its elements are pairs (A,\u03c3) for which the action of the orthogonal\ntransformation A on the equilibrium configuration is the same as that of the permutation \u03c3.\nRELATIVE EQUILIBRIA OF MOLECULES 3\nC\nH\nH\nH H\n\u21131\n\u21132\n\u21133\nThe methane molecule and its symmetry axes.\nFigure 1:\nConsider for example the methane molecule CH4, consisting of four light hydrogen atoms dis-\ntributed around a central massive carbon atom, see Figure 1. In its equilibrium state, the hydrogen\nnuclei are positioned at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron. The symmetry group \u0393 is isomorphic to\nthe subgroup of O(3) which consists of orthogonal rotations and reflections which map the tetrahe-\ndron to itself. Chemists denote this group by Td . Each of these transformations gives a non-trivial\npermutation of the hydrogen nuclei, and every such permutation is realised by an element of Td . Thus\n\u0393 is also isomorphic to the symmetric group S4. Note that in general \u0393 will be a finite group if and\nonly if the equilibrium configuration is not collinear.\nThe tetrahedral symmetry of the methane equilibrium configuration forces its inertia tensor to be\nscalar and so methane is a spherical top molecule and has a whole 2-sphere of relative equilibria in the\nrigid body approximation. These correspond to the tetrahedral configuration rotating about arbitrary\naxes through the centre of mass of the equilibrium configuration, ie the carbon nucleus. In \u00a72 we\nwill show that those relative equilibria with dynamical axes corresponding to symmetry axes of the\nequilibrium configuration persist for the full Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian.\nMore precisely, consider the action of \u0393 on R3 determined by its projection into O(3). Let the\naxes of rotation of \u0393 be the one dimensional fixed point sets of the rotations in this projection and the\naxes of reflection the lines through the origin perpendicular to the planes fixed by the reflections. The\nfollowing result is a consequence of Theorem 2.7, the main theorem of this paper (or of its subsidiary\nTheorem 2.1), as explained in Example 2.4. The non-degeneracy condition on the equilibrium is\ndescribed in \u00a7 2.1.\nTheorem 0.1\nConsider a molecule with a non-degenerate equilibrium with symmetry group \u0393<O(3)\u00d7\u03a3. There\nexists \u00b50 > 0 such that for all \u00b5 \u2208R3 with |\u00b5|< \u00b50 there are at least 6 relative equilibria with angular\nmomentum \u00b5. Moreover, for each axis \u2113 of rotation or reflection in \u0393, there are two relative equilibria\nwith angular momentum \u00b5 and dynamical axis \u2113, one rotating in each direction.\nThe tetrahedral equilibrium of the methane molecule has 13 axes of symmetry, divided into 3\ntypes, and representatives of each type are shown in Figure 1. There are 4 axes of 3-fold rotational\nsymmetry joining the carbon nucleus to each of the hydrogen nuclei (denoted \u21133 in the figure), 3\n4 J.A. MONTALDI & R.M. ROBERTS\naxes of 2-fold rotational symmetry joining mid-points of opposite edges of the tetrahedron (\u21131 in the\nfigure), and 6 axes of reflection passing through the carbon nucleus, parallel to an edge of the tetrahe-\ndron (\u21132 in the figure). By the theorem there are two families of relative equilibria bifurcating from\nthe equilibrium for each of these axes, a total of 26 families. Since this existence result depends only\non the tetrahedral symmetry group Td of the equilibrium, precisely the same result is true of any\nother molecule with an equilibrium with the same symmetry group such as P4 (white phosphorous).\nMoreover, it turns out that the same symmetry analysis holds for molecules with the cubic or octahe-\ndral symmetry group Oh such as SF6. On the other hand, the details regarding which of the relative\nequilibria are stable will depend on the molecule in question.\nTheorem 2.7 is a generalization of a result of Montaldi [12] on bifurcations of relative equilibria\nof Hamiltonian systems given by Hamiltonians H which are invariant under free actions of a group G.\nIn this paper we relax this by requiring only that the connected component of the identity of G acts\nfreely, and so the isotropy subgroup, \u0393, of the equilibrium point from which the relative equilibria\nare bifurcating is finite. By using a combination of the Moncrief decomposition of the tangent space\nto a symplectic manifold [11, 13] and the equivariant splitting lemma we show that a G-invariant\nHamiltonian H induces a \u0393-invariant function h on g\u2217, the dual of the Lie algebra of G, such that the\nbifurcating relative equilibria are given by the critical points of restrictions of h to the orbits of the\ncoadjoint action of G on g\u2217. For a precise statement see Theorems 2.1 and 2.7.\nFor molecular Hamiltonians the symmetry group G is the group O(3)\u00d7\u03a3 described above. The\nspace g\u2217 is the space of angular momentum values and is isomorphic to R3 and the coadjoint action of\nG is generated by the standard action of SO(3) on R3 together with trivial actions of\u2212I \u2208O(3) and of\n\u03a3. The coadjoint orbits are just the 2-spheres centred at the origin in R3. These are invariant under the\naction of \u0393 on R3 obtained by restricting the action of O(3)\u00d7\u03a3 and the search for bifurcating relative\nequilibria reduces to finding critical points of \u0393-invariant functions h on these spheres. The relative\nequilibria described in Theorem 0.1 correspond to points on the spheres which are critical points for\nall \u0393-invariant functions h by virtue of being the fixed point sets of maximal isotropy subgroups of the\n\u0393 action.\nIn this paper we also incorporate the effects of the time-reversal symmetry possessed by any\nHamiltonian which is the sum of a quadratic kinetic energy function and a potential energy function.\nThis leads to the function h on g\u2217 being even (invariant under \u00b5 7\u2192\u2212\u00b5) in addition to being \u0393-invariant.\nIn some cases the presence of this extra symmetry enables us to deduce that there must be extra\nbifurcating relative equilibria in addition to those predicted by Theorem 0.1. We show that this occurs\nfor XY3 molecules such as ammonia (NH3) in Example 2.5.\nThe results we have described so far give the existence of relative equilibria with particular sym-\nmetries and are proved using symmetry considerations alone. To find out whether there are any others\nthe Taylor series of h at 0 in g\u2217 has to be calculated to a sufficiently high order. In Section 3 we de-\nscribe how to do this for molecular Hamiltonians using the reduced form of the Hamiltonian function\nH obtained by Eckart in 1935 [4]. In the final subsections this is applied to molecules of type XY2, XY4\nand X3. In particular we show that the 26-relative equilibria described above are generically the only\nrelative equilibria which bifurcate from a tetrahedral equilibrium configuration of an XY4 molecule.\nIn Section 2 we also give some general results on the stability of the relative equilibria bifurcating\nfrom an equilibrium. See Theorem 2.8. For molecular Hamiltonians these imply that if the equilib-\nrium point is a non-degenerate minimum of the potential energy function then relative equilibria which\ncorrespond to minima of h on the angular momentum spheres are Liapounov stable, those correspond-\ning to maxima are linearly stable, but typically not Liapounov stable, while those corresponding to\nsaddle points are linearly unstable. Here stability is always to be interpreted in an orbital sense [16].\nThus the calculations of Section 3 also enable us to determine the stabilities of the bifurcating relative\nequilibria.\nRELATIVE EQUILIBRIA OF MOLECULES 5\nThe stabilities of the bifurcating relative equilibria are determined by the low order terms in the\n\u0393-invariant even function h discussed above, and which terms one needs depends upon the symmetry\ngroup \u0393 of the equilibrium. For non-symmetric molecules where the principal moments of inertia are\ndistinct the second order terms of h are sufficient to determine the stabilities. These second order terms\ndepend only on the inertia tensor of the equilibrium configuration. It follows then that the stabilities\nare precisely those found in the rigid body approximation discussed above.\nIn the case of spherical top molecules, for tetrahedral Td symmetry or octahedral Oh symmetry the\nfourth order terms are required, while for icosahedral Ih symmetry (such as for buckminsterfullerene)\nthe sixth order terms are required as well. For the symmetric top molecules with dihedral or cyclic\nsymmetry, those with square symmetry require fourth order terms, while those with triangular or\nhexagonal symmetry require sixth order terms.\nIn terms of physical molecular parameters, the fourth order terms depend on the so-called inertia\nderivatives (the derivatives of the inertia tensor as a function of shape evaluated at the equilibrium\nconfiguration \u2014 our Is(0), or the a\u03b1\u03b2k of [1]) together with the harmonic force constants (the quadratic\npart of the potential energy function). The sixth order terms of h require in addition knowledge of\nthe Coriolis coupling constants (our matrix C, denoted Z in [20], or the \u03b6\u03b1i j in [1]), the second inertia\nderivatives and certain anharmonic force constants (third derivatives of the potential energy function).\nThe quadratic and quartic parts of h are given in closed form in Proposition 3.1, while the degree 6\npart is computed only for X3 molecules in \u00a73.5.\nUsing data on molecular parameters taken from a standard textbook on molecular spectroscopy\n[7] we show, for example, that for methane the 6 relative equilibria with dynamical axes along the 2-\nfold rotation axes are Liapounov stable, the 8 relative equilibria with dynamical axes along the 3-fold\nrotation axes are linearly stable and the 12 relative equilibria with dynamical axes along the reflection\naxes are unstable. This is in agreement with [3], where they also derive these results by considering\na function h on 2-spheres, although their functions derive from quantum-mechanical considerations.\nUsing more recent data [2] we show in \u00a73.5 that for the H+3 molecule the relative equilbria with\ndynamical axis along the 2-fold rotation axis (\u21132 in Figure 3) are linearly unstable, while those with\ndynamical axis along the reflection axis (\u21133 in Figure 3) are linearly stable.\nThe restriction in Theorem 2.7 to equilibria with finite isotropy subgroups means that our results\nonly apply to bifurcations of relative equilibria from equilibrium configurations that are not collinear.\nA bifurcation theorem for group actions with non-finite isotropy subgroups has been obtained by\nRoberts and Sousa Dias [18]. That paper also contains a brief discussion of relative equilibria bifur-\ncating from collinear equilibrium configurations of molecules.\nIn this paper we are concerned only with the classical dynamics of molecular Hamiltonians. If the\nmethods and results are to be applied to molecular spectra then they must be related to the quantum\nmechanics, presumably by semi-classical techniques. This is a project for the future. However we\nnote that some elements of the theory developed here are reminiscent of the work of Harter and\nPatterson [6] on the spectra of SF6, and of Pavlichenkov, Zhilinskii and coworkers, see [17, 19] and\nthe survey [22]. In particular these methods also generate \u0393-invariant functions on angular momentum\nspheres similar to the functions h of this paper. These are obtained as the classical limits of quantum\nHamiltonians restricted to certain finite dimensional spaces of quantum states, rather than by a purely\nclassical reduction procedure. Moreover the methods are used to explain observed patterns in high\nangular momenta spectra, rather than the low angular momentum regime considered in this paper.\nNevertheless we believe that new insights into the structure of ro-vibrational spectra may be obtained\nby exploring the relationship between these two approaches.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank Jonathan Tennyson for useful discussions, and the anony-\nmous referees for a number of suggestions.

Regarding the atomic nuclei as point\nmasses the configuration space is R3N , which it is useful to view as\nC = RN \u2297R3 \u2243 L(N,3).\nHere L(N,3) is the space of real 3\u00d7N matrices. The N columns of a configuration matrix Q represent\nthe positions qi of the N nuclei (i = 1, . . . ,N). The total phase space is then P = T \u2217C \u2243 R6N , which\nwe can identify with the space of pairs (P,Q) of 3\u00d7N matrices. The columns of P are the momenta\npi of the nuclei.\nIf the mass of the ith nucleus is mi the dynamics of the system is given by the Hamiltonian\nH(p,q) = \u2211\ni\n1\n2mi\n|pi|2 +V (q1, . . . ,qN)\nwhere V (q1, . . . ,qN) is the potential energy of the configuration Q due to the electronic bonding be-\ntween the nuclei. In terms of matrices, we have\nH(P,Q) = 12 tr(PM\u22121PT )+V (Q), (1.1)\nwhere M is the diagonal mass matrix with entries m1, . . . ,mN . For any motion Q(t), the momentum P\nis related to the velocity \u02d9Q by,\nP = \u02d9QM.\nThe centre of mass of the molecule is given by the sum of the columns of the matrix QM. If there\nare no external forces on the molecule, the centre of mass moves in an inertial frame, which we can\ntake to be fixed (corresponding to taking total momentum equal to zero), and we can choose the origin\nto coincide with the centre of mass. Thus, henceforth, we assume that the sum of the columns of QM\nis zero. That is,\nC = L0(N,3) = {Q \u2208 L(N,3) |\u2211\nj\nqi j = 0, i = 1,2,3}.\nConsequently,\nP = T \u2217L0(N,3)\u223c= L0(N,3)\u00d7L0(N,3).\n1.1 Symmetries of the Model\nThere are three types of symmetry of this model: euclidean motions, internal particle relabelling and\ntime-reversal. These are described below.\nOf the euclidean motions, we have already eliminated the translational component by fixing the\ncentre of mass. Rotation or reflection of the molecule (or change of basis in R3) by an orthogonal\nmatrix A acts on configuration space C = L0(N,3) by multiplication by A on the left: A \u00b7Q = AQ. In\nthe absence of external forces this leaves the potential energy invariant.\nThe relabelling symmetry group can be described as follows. If some of the nuclei are identical\nthen a finite subgroup \u03a3 of the permutation group SN acts by permuting the N nuclei, in such a way\nthat for \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 < SN ,the nuclei i and \u03c3(i) are indistinguishable. Thus \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 if and only if,\nV (q\u03c3(1), . . . ,q\u03c3(N)) = V (q1, . . . ,qN), m\u03c3(i) = mi, (1.2)\nRELATIVE EQUILIBRIA OF MOLECULES 7\nfor all (q1, . . . ,qN) \u2208 C , and all i.\nFor \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, we also denote by \u03c3 the associated N \u00d7N permutation matrix, which acts on C by\nmultiplication by \u03c3T on the right. Note that this matrix commutes with M, by (1.2).\nThere is thus an action of O(3)\u00d7\u03a3 on the configuration space C = L0(N,3) leaving the potential\nenergy invariant:\n(A,\u03c3) \u00b7Q = AQ\u03c3T . (1.3)\nIt is simple to see that the induced action of O(3)\u00d7 \u03a3 on P = T \u2217L0(N,3) is a symmetry of the\nHamiltonian system, for P transforms in the same way as Q, so that\nH((A,\u03c3) \u00b7 (P,Q)) = 12 tr\n(\n(AP\u03c3T )M\u22121(\u03c3PT AT )\n)\n+V (AQ\u03c3T ) = H(P,Q),\nwhere we have used the fact that M and \u03c3 commute.\nNote that the group \u03a3 of relabelling symmetries is not in general the same as the group that is often\nthought of as being the symmetry group of a molecule, namely the symmetry group of its equilibrium\nconfiguration. For example buckminsterfullerene, C60, has \u03a3 equal to S60, but its equilibrium only has\nicosahedral symmetry Ih. For the symmetry group of a given equilibrium configuration, which we\nwill denote by \u0393, see \u00a71.2 below.\nAs with any classical Hamiltonian system of the form \u2018kinetic + potential\u2019, the molecule model is\ntime reversible. That is, H is invariant under the involution\n\u03c4 : (P,Q) 7\u2192 (\u2212P,Q).\nWe denote by Z\u03c42 the group generated by \u03c4. Note that the action of Z\u03c42 commutes with the action of any\ngroup G that is induced from an action on C . In particular it commutes with the action of O(3)\u00d7\u03a3\ndescribed above. Thus, when time reversal is included, the symmetry group of the system becomes\nO(3)\u00d7\u03a3\u00d7Z\u03c42.\nOne of the important consequences of the SO(3)-symmetry is that angular momentum is con-\nserved. The usual expression for the angular momentum of a system of point masses, J = \u2211i qi\u2227 pi,\nhere becomes\nJ(P,Q) = 12 (PQT \u2212QPT ), (1.4)\nwhere we consider angular momentum as a skew-symmetric matrix rather than a vector. In fact it\nis naturally an element of the dual space so(3)\u2217, but we identify \u00b5 \u2208 so(3)\u2217 with a skew symmetric\nmatrix by the usual formula: \u3008\u00b5,\u03be\u3009= tr(\u00b5T \u03be). Note that J(\u2212P,Q) =\u2212J(P,Q), so that the time-reversal\noperator reverses angular momentum. For the orthogonal symmetries J(AP,AQ) = AJ(P,Q)AT . If we\nidentify the skew-symmetric matrices with vectors in R3 then this transformation becomes\nJ 7\u2192 det(A)AJ. (1.5)\nThe angular momentum is also invariant under the action of the relabelling symmetry group \u03a3 on the\nphase space, J(P\u03c3T ,Q\u03c3T ) = J(P,Q). Thus J is equivariant with respect to the action of O(3)\u00d7\u03a3\u00d7Z\u03c42\non phase space defined above and the action on momentum space so(3)\u2217 \u223c= R3 given by:\n(A,\u03c3).\u00b5 = det(A)A\u00b5 (1.6)\n\u03c4.\u00b5 = \u2212\u00b5. (1.7)\nFor A \u2208 SO(3), the action on \u00b5 is just \u00b5 7\u2192 A\u00b5, while for A \u2208O(3)\\SO(3) the action is \u00b5 7\u2192 \u2212A\u00b5, and\n\u2212A is a rotation about the axis of reflection of A.\n8 J.A. MONTALDI & R.M. ROBERTS\n1.2 Configuration Symmetries\nThe symmetry group of a particular configuration Q0 of a molecule is the isotropy subgroup of Q0 for\nthe action of O(3)\u00d7\u03a3 on configuration space. In other words it is the subgroup, \u0393(Q0), of O(3)\u00d7\u03a3\nconsisting of elements which map Q0 to itself:\n\u0393(Q) = {(A,\u03c3) \u2208 O(3)\u00d7\u03a3 | (A,\u03c3) \u00b7Q0 = Q0}.\nNote that if Q1 is a configuration which can be obtained from a configuration Q0 by applying an\nelement of O(3)\u00d7 \u03a3, ie Q1 = (A,\u03c3) \u00b7Q0, then (A,\u03c3) conjugates the isotropy subgroup \u0393(Q0) to\n\u0393(Q1):\n\u0393(Q1) = (A,\u03c3)\u0393(Q0)(A,\u03c3)\u22121.\nLet \u0393 = \u0393(Q0) be an isotropy subgroup. Away from collinear configurations SO(3) acts freely.\nThis fact is essential in what follows, and so collinear configurations will not be considered in this\npaper (see [18] for a brief discussion of them). Moreover, it is clear that a configuration is fixed by an\nelement of O(3)\\SO(3) if and only if it is planar, and if the planar configuration is not collinear then\nthe element of O(3) in question is a reflection. Thus for non-planar configurations the projection, \u03932,\nof \u0393 < O(3)\u00d7\u03a3 into \u03a3 is an isomorphism. For planar non-collinear configurations \u0393 is isomorphic to\nan extension of \u03932 by the group of order 2. In both cases the group \u0393 is finite.\nFixed points for the action of the pure relabelling group \u03a3 are not of interest, since they correspond\nto points where 2 or more nuclei coincide. However, there are interesting isotropy groups of mixed\ntype, where \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 acts in the same way as some A \u2208 O(3). For example, in the methane molecule at\nequilibrium (Figure 1), every permutation of the four hydrogen nuclei can be realised by an orthogonal\ntransformation. The same is true of the water molecule. But, as has already been pointed out, it is not\ntrue of buckminsterfullerene.\nThe fact that \u03a3 acts freely on configurations without coincident nuclei implies that the isotropy\nsubgroup of such a configuration is isomorphic to its projection, \u03931, to O(3). The axes of rotation\nand reflection of the configuration are, respectively, the axes of rotation (1-dimensional fixed-point\nspaces) of elements A \u2208 \u03931 \u2229 SO(3), and the axes perpendicular to the reflection planes for A \u2208\n\u03931 \u2229 (O(3) \\ SO(3)). Note that in the latter case the axis of reflection of A is the axis of rotation\nof \u2212A.\n1.3 Examples\nWe now describe the relative equilibria obtained by applying Theorem 0.1 to a number of different\ntypes of small molecule. In the introduction there is a similar discussion of the methane molecule.\nThe stabilities of these relative equilibria will be calculated in Section 3.\nExample 1.1 Planar molecules\nConsider a planar equilibrium configuration of a molecule, for example any equilibrium configuration\nof a molecule with three atoms. Its symmetry group will contain the element of O(3) corresponding\nto reflection in that plane. If the atoms are all different and the configuration is not collinear then\nthis will be the only symmetry. The groups \u0393 and \u03931 are both isomorphic to Z2 and \u03932 is trivial.\nThe chemists\u2019 notation for this symmetry group \u0393 is Cs. We denote the reflection itself by rs. The\nconfiguration has one axis of reflection, perpendicular to the plane containing the molecule.\nTheorem 0.1 says that these molecules will have two families of bifurcating relative equilibria with\ndynamical axes equal to the reflection axis, together with at least four more families. In Section 3 (see\nCorollary 3.2) we will show that generically these molecules have precisely six families and that their\ndynamical axes are close to the principal axes of inertia of the equilibrium configuration. One of these\nRELATIVE EQUILIBRIA OF MOLECULES 9\naxes coincides with the reflection axis, so in this case the dynamical axis remains equal to the inertia\naxis.\nExample 1.2 Non-collinear XY2 molecules\nIn addition to the reflection rs described in the previous example, a configuration of a triatomic\nmolecule with two identical atoms can also be invariant under a reflection in O(3) through a plane\nperpendicular to that containing the molecule, combined with permutation of the two identical nuclei.\nWe denote this reflection by rt and the permutation by pi. The composition of the two reflections gives\na rotation of order 2 about the axis defined by the intersection of the two reflection planes. This we\ndenote by \u03c1. It follows that (\u03c1,pi) is also a symmetry of the configuration. The symmetry group \u0393\nconsists of the identity together with the elements (rs, I),(rt ,pi) and (\u03c1,pi), where I is the identity in\n\u03a3. The nontrivial elements of the projection \u03931 are rs,rt and \u03c1. Both \u0393 and \u03931 are isomorphic to\nZ2 \u00d7Z2. The projection \u03932 is isomorphic to Z2 and is generated by pi. The chemists\u2019 notation for\nthis symmetry group is C2v. There are many molecules with equilibria with this symmetry, including\nwater, H2O.\nThis symmetry group has two axes of reflection (\u21131 and \u21133 in Figure 2) and one of rotation (\u21132),\nall mutually perpendicular. Each of these gives two families of relative equilibria branching from the\nequilibrium point. Two of the families are similar to those of the previous example - the dynamical\naxis is the axis of the reflection in the plane containing the molecule.\nWe will see in \u00a73.3 that generically, these are the only families of relative equilibria that branch\nfrom the equilibrium solution.\nExample 1.3 Equilateral X3 molecules\nA configuration of a molecule with three identical atoms in which the three nuclei lie at the corners of\nan equilateral triangle has the reflectional symmetry rs together with three further reflectional symme-\ntries through planes perpendicular to the reflection plane of rs, each of which must be combined with\nan appropriate permutation. Composing one of these three reflections with rs gives a rotation of order\n2 which is also a symmetry when combined with a permutation. In addition there is an order 3 rota-\ntion about an axis perpendicular to the reflection plane of rs, again with corresponding permutation.\nTogether these give a symmetry group \u0393 which is isomorphic to Z2 \u00d7D3 (where D3 is the dihedral\ngroup of order 6) and is denoted by chemists by D3h. The projection \u03932 is equal to \u03a3 = S3, which is\nisomorphic to D3. An example of a molecule with an equilibrium with this symmetry is the molecular\nion H+3 .\nThis configuration has three reflectional axes (similar to \u21133 in Figure 2), three rotational axes\n(similar to \u21132) and an axis (similar to \u21131) which is both rotational (for the rotation of order 3) and\nreflectional (for rs) . By Theorem 0.1, for low angular momentum an X3 molecule has 14 relative\nequilibria rotating about these axes. Again, we will see in \u00a73.5 that generically these are the only\nrelative equilibria for sufficiently small values of angular momentum. We will also discuss their\nstabilities.\nExample 1.4 Ammonia: NH3\nThe ammonia molecule consists of one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms and has an equilib-\nrium configuration in which the three hydrogens lie at the corners of an equilateral triangle and the\nnitrogen lies on the axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry of the triangle, but not in the same plane. This\nconfiguration is therefore non-planar and its symmetry group \u0393, denoted C3v by chemists, is isomor-\nphic to a D3 subgroup of the previous example. The configuration has one axis of (3-fold) rotational\nsymmetry and three axes of reflectional symmetry, and therefore 8 bifurcating relative equilibria ro-\ntating about these axes.\nWe will see in Example 2.5 that these are not the only relative equilibria of the ammonia molecule\nnear the equilibrium. There are at least a further 6 relative equilibria which are not geometric, in the\n10 J.A. MONTALDI & R.M. ROBERTS\n\u21131\n\u21132\n\u21133\nFigure 2: Axes for the XY2 molecule\nsense that their precise location depends on the form of the inter-atomic bonding. In fact their axes\nlie in the planes containing an N\u2212H bond and the centre of mass. There is thus a total of 14 relative\nequilibria near the equilibrium for the ammonia molecule.\nThe ammonia molecule is also interesting because it has two symmetrically related stable equilib-\nria, one with the N atom above the H3-plane, and one with it below. They are separated by a potential\nbarrier, and between the two stable equilibria there is a planar equilibrium configuration with Z2\u00d7D3\nsymmetry. This is the same symmetry group as in Example 1.3, though here the equilibrium is un-\nstable. Each of the stable equilibria will have 14 relative equilibria nearby, as described above, and\nfurthermore the unstable equilibrium will also have 14 relative equilibria nearby, as described in the\nprevious example, since the existence arguments depend only on the symmetry and not on either the\nnumber of atoms or the stability of the equilibrium. The potential barrier between the stable equilibria\nis very low, accounting for the \u2018inversion flip\u2019 seen in ammonia. This means that the local bifurcation\nanalysis performed in this paper is truly local, and the existence of the other equilibria will interfere\nwith extending it to high energy or angular momentum. A more global analysis of ammonia would\ntherefore be useful.\nThere are other molecules with this C3v symmetry, such as CHD3, where the potential barrier is\nvery high, and the relative equilibria found by our analysis can be expected to persist to much higher\nvalues of the angular momentum.\n2 Existence and Stability of Relative Equilibria\nLet P be a symplectic manifold with a symplectic action of a compact Lie group G and a G-equivariant\nmomentum map J : P \u2192 g\u2217. Let H be a G-invariant smooth Hamiltonian function defined on P . If G\nacts freely (ie the isotropy subgroups are all trivial) then the reduced phase spaces P\u00b5 = J\u22121(\u00b5)\/G\u00b5 are\nthemselves symplectic manifolds and the relative equilibria of H in P are given by the critical points\nof the induced functions H\u00b5 on the P\u00b5. In [12] it was shown that, near a non-degenerate equilibrium\npoint p of H with J(p) = 0, the critical points of H\u00b5 correspond bijectively to those of a function\ndefined on the coadjoint orbit G.\u00b5.\nEssentially the same technique will be used in this paper to find the relative equilibria of molecules.\nOf course the action of G = O(3)\u00d7 \u03a3 on P described in \u00a7 1.1 is not free. However, away from\ncollinear configurations of molecules, the action of SO(3) is free and we can reduce by it as in [12].\nThe new ingredient in this paper is that we then consider the action of the (finite) quotient group\n(O(3)\u00d7\u03a3)\/SO(3)\u223c= Z2\u00d7\u03a3 on the reduced spaces.\nRELATIVE EQUILIBRIA OF MOLECULES 11\nWe also incorporate time reversal symmetry, restricting, for simplicity, to the case when P = T \u2217C\nis a cotangent bundle. In this setting, the reduction procedure can be made more explicit than in the\ngeneral case. It is also global, as described in [11], though the results in this paper are purely local.\nIn this section we will work in the general setting of a cotangent action of a compact Lie group G\non P for which the connected component containing the identity, denoted G0, acts freely. In the next\nsubsection we state our main existence theorem for relative equilibria of Hamiltonians which are also\ninvariant under the time reversal operator \u03c4(p,q) = (\u2212p,q). We will use G\u0302 to denote the product\nG\u00d7Z\u03c42.\n2.1 An Existence Theorem\nLet g denote the Lie algebra of G and G0. The momentum map J : P = T \u2217C \u2192 g\u2217 is given by\nJ\u03be(p,q) = \u3008J(p,q),\u03be\u3009=\n\u2329\np,X\u03be(q)\n\u232a\n, (2.1)\nwhere \u03be \u2208 g and X\u03be is the vector field corresponding to the action of \u03be on C . The angular momentum\n(1.4) is a special case. A straightforward calculation shows that this commutes with the action of G\non P and the coadjoint action on g\u2217. It also commutes with the action of the time reversal operator \u03c4\non P given by \u03c4.(p,q) = (\u2212p,q) and its action on g\u2217 by \u2212I.\nSince G0 is acting freely, the orbit space P\/G0 is a smooth manifold and the momentum map\n(2.1) is a submersion P \u2192 g\u2217. We denote the G0-coadjoint orbits by O\u00b5 = G0.\u00b5. The equivariance\nof the momentum map implies that there is a well-defined orbit momentum map j : P\/G0 \u2212\u2192 g\u2217\/G0,\nmaking the following diagram commute,\nP\nJ\u2212\u2192 g\u2217\n\u2193 \u2193\nP\/G0\nj\u2212\u2192 g\u2217\/G0.\nThat is, j is defined on P\/G0 by j(G0.x) = G0.J(x) = OJ(x). The components of the map j are Casimirs\nfor the natural Poisson structure on the orbit space. The reduced spaces P\u00b5 are, by definition, the fibres\nof j.\nUp to now, we have understood a relative equilibrium to be a trajectory of the dynamics that lies\nin a group orbit, and any such trajectory has a well-defined momentum \u00b5. Since we are now working\nin the orbit space P\/G0, it is more natural to take a relative equilibrium to be a G0-orbit of such\ntrajectories \u2013 or equivalently, an invariant G0-orbit (as in [12]). The momentum of such a relative\nequilibrium is now a group orbit O\u00b5.\nAs we have only reduced by the G0 action, and not by the full G\u0302-action, there is still an action of\nthe finite group G\u0302\/G0 remaining on P\/G0. The quotient G\u0302\/G0 also acts on g\u2217\/G0, and with respect\nto these actions, j is equivariant. Let \u03a0 denote the projection\n\u03a0 : G\u0302 \u2212\u2192 G\u0302\/G0,\nand let \u03a0(G\u0302)O\u00b5 denote the isotropy subgroup of O\u00b5 \u2208 g\u2217\/G0. Then \u03a0(G\u0302)O\u00b5 acts on P\u00b5. In the case\nof molecules, where G0 = SO(3), the orbit space g\u2217\/G0 is a half line, and so \u03a0(G\u0302) acts trivially on\ng\n\u2217\/G0, so that \u03a0(G\u0302)O\u00b5 = \u03a0(G\u0302).\nIf H is a G\u0302-invariant Hamiltonian on P there is an induced G\u0302\/G0-invariant function on the quotient\nspace P\/G0 that we still denote by H. We denote the restriction of this function to P\u00b5 \u2282 P\/G0 by H\u00b5.\nThis restriction is \u03a0(G\u0302)O\u00b5 -invariant.\n12 J.A. MONTALDI & R.M. ROBERTS\nLet x = (0,q) \u2208 P be an equilibrium point of H with isotropy subgroup \u0393 for the G action and\n\u0393\u0302 = \u0393\u00d7Z\u03c42 for the G\u0302 action. Then G0.x is a critical point of H0 in P0 \u2282 P\/G0. The group \u0393\u0302 acts on\nP\/G0 via its projection \u03a0(\u0393\u0302). Since \u0393\u0302\u2229G0 is trivial, \u03a0(\u0393\u0302) is isomorphic to \u0393\u0302. The group \u0393\u0302 also acts\non g\u2217 by the restriction of the G\u0302 action and on g\u2217\/G0 by the restriction of the \u03a0(G\u0302) action. Let \u0393\u0302O\u00b5\ndenote the isotropy subgroup of O\u00b5 \u2208 g\u2217\/G0 for this latter action.\nThe following theorem is part of the main result of this paper (Theorem 2.7), but is stated here\nas it is less technical, and already has several useful consequences. Recall that a critical point x of a\nfunction f is said to be non-degenerate if the second derivative d2 f (x) is non-degenerate as a quadratic\nform.\nTheorem 2.1\nSuppose that H0 has a non-degenerate critical point at G0.x \u2208 P0. Then there exists a smooth \u0393\u0302-\ninvariant function h : g\u2217 \u2192 R, such that for each \u00b5 the critical points of h\u00b5 = h\nO\u00b5\nare in 1-1 corre-\nspondence with the relative equilibria of H with momentum O\u00b5. Moreover this correspondence is\nequivariant: if \u03bd is a critical point of h with isotropy K < \u0393\u0302, then the corresponding relative equilib-\nrium also has isotropy group K.\nWe will see in Theorem 2.7 that the 1-1 correspondence is in fact given by a smooth embedding\n\u03b4 : g\u2217\u2192 P\/G0 satisfying j(\u03b4(\u00b5)) = O\u00b5, and h = H \u25e6\u03b4. It seems likely that the \u0393\u0302-invariance of h can be\nused to give lower bounds for the number of bifurcating relative equilibria on each nearby momentum\nlevel set, generalising the Lusternick-Schnirelman category bound given in [12].\nExample 2.2 Molecules\nFor the application to molecules described in \u00a71 we take G = O(3)\u00d7 \u03a3. Then G0 = SO(3) and\ng\n\u2217 = so(3)\u2217 \u223c= R3. The coadjoint orbits O\u00b5 are the 2-spheres centred at the origin in R3. The quotient\nspace g\u2217\/G0 is just a half-line and the action of \u03a0(G\u0302) on it is trivial. Hence \u03a0(G\u0302)O\u00b5 = \u03a0(G\u0302) and\n\u0393\u0302O\u00b5 = \u03a0(\u0393\u0302). In particular the functions h\u00b5 must be invariant under the action of \u03c4 by \u2212I on the\n2-spheres and so are given by functions on O\u00b5\/Z\u03c42 \u223c= RP2, the 2-dimensional real projective space.\nThe Lusternick-Schnirelman category of RP2 is equal to 3 and so the quotient functions must have at\nleast 3 critical points and the h\u00b5 must have at least 6 critical points. By Theorem 2.1 these give the\n6 families of relative equilibria claimed in Theorem 0.1. If one assumes that the equilibria of h\u00b5 are\nnon-degenerate, then the Morse inequalities give the same result.\n2.2 Symmetric Relative Equilibria\nIf G\u0302y is the isotropy subgroup for the G\u0302 action on P at y then \u03a0(G\u0302y) is the isotropy subgroup for the\n\u03a0(G\u0302) action on P\/G0 at G0.y. Since G0 acts freely on P , \u03a0(G\u0302y) is isomorphic to G\u0302y. If y2 = g.y1 for\nsome g \u2208 G\u0302 then Gy2 = gGy1 g\u22121 and \u03a0(Gy2) = \u03a0(g)\u03a0(Gy1)\u03a0(g)\u22121. So, if y1 and y2 belong to the\nsame G orbit the isotropy subgroups of G0.y1 and G0.y2 in P\/G0 are conjugate in \u03a0(G\u0302).\nIn Theorem 2.1, if \u03bd \u2208 O\u00b5 is a critical point of h\u00b5 with isotropy subgroup K \u2282 \u0393\u0302O\u00b5 \u2282 \u03a0(G\u0302) then\nthe corresponding relative equilibrium in P\/G0 also has isotropy subgroup K and so \u03a0 projects\nthe isotropy subgroups of points in the corresponding orbit G0.y isomorphically to K. The follow-\ning corollary of Theorem 2.1 predicts the existence of families of relative equilibria with particular\nisotropy subgroups. We say that an isotropy subgroup K is maximal if it is not contained in any other\nisotropy subgroup.\nCorollary 2.3 With the same hypotheses as in Theorem 2.1, if K is an isotropy subgroup of the action\nof \u0393\u0302O\u00b5 on O\u00b5 then there must be at least one family of relative equilibria bifurcating from x with\nRELATIVE EQUILIBRIA OF MOLECULES 13\nisotropy subgroups which project to a subgroup of \u0393\u0302O\u00b5 containing K. If K is a maximal isotropy\nsubgroup then the isotropy subgroups project isomorphically to K.\nProof The fixed point set of the action of K on O\u00b5, denoted Fix(K,O\u00b5), is a compact smooth mani-\nfold and so the restriction of h\u00b5 to it must have a critical point. By the principle of symmetric criticality\n[14] this will also be a critical point of h\u00b5 itself, and will have isotropy subgroup containing K. If K\nis a maximal isotropy subgroup then the isotropy subgroup of the critical point is precisely K. The\nresult now follows from Theorem 2.1 and the remarks above. 2\nExample 2.4 Rotation and reflection axes of molecules\nBy Example 2.2 for molecules we have\n\u0393\u0302O\u00b5 \u223c= \u0393\u0302 \u223c= \u0393\u00d7Z\u03c42 \u2282 O(3)\u00d7\u03a3\u00d7Z\u03c42.\nThe coadjoint orbits O\u00b5 can be identified with the 2-spheres centred at the origin in so(3)\u2217 \u223c= R3. The\ngroup \u0393\u0302 acts on these by the restriction to \u0393\u0302 of the projection of O(3)\u00d7\u03a3\u00d7Z\u03c42 to SO(3)\u00d7Z\u03c42.\nEach rotation and reflection axis \u2113 of the equilibrium configuration defines a subgroup K\u2113 of \u0393\u0302\nwhich fixes the corresponding axis in so(3)\u2217. For a rotation axis the group K\u2113 contains the rotations\nabout \u2113 which map the equilibrium configuration to itself, up to permutations of identical nuclei. For\na reflection axis K\u2113 contains the corresponding reflection. Note that an axis can be both a reflection\naxis and a rotation axis, in which case K\u2113 contains both types of elements. A rotation or reflection\naxis \u2113 can also be fixed by a reflection in a plane which contains \u2113. In this case K\u2113 also contains the\ncomposition of this reflection with \u03c4.\nThese subgroups K\u2113 are precisely the maximal isotropy subgroups for the actions of \u0393\u0302 on the\nO\u00b5. Each of them has a fixed point set consisting of two points and so h\u00b5 must have two critical\npoints with that isotropy subgroup. These two critical points are equivalent under the Z\u03c42-action. The\ncorresponding relative equilibria have isotropy subgroups which are conjugate to K\u2113 by rotations in\nSO(3). Those with isotropy subgroup equal to K\u2113 correspond to the molecule rotating about the axis\n\u2113. The conjugate groups are the isotropy subgroups of spatial rotations of these motions.\nThese remarks complete the proof of Theorem 0.1.\nExample 2.5 Ammonia\nAs a particular example we consider the case of ammonia, NH3. By Example 1.4 the group \u0393 is\nisomorphic to D3. Its projection to O(3) contains the rotations by 2pi\/3 about one axis and 3 reflections\nwith axes perpendicular to the rotation axis. The action of \u0393 on O\u00b5 \u223c= S2 is by rotations, the \u2018reflections\u2019\nin D3 acting by rotation by pi about the corresponding reflection axis. In addition \u03c4 acts by \u2212I.\nThe combined action of D3 \u00d7Z\u03c4 has 4 maximal isotropy subgroups, falling into 2 conjugacy\nclasses. The 3 corresponding to the reflection axes are isomorphic to Z2 and are generated by the\nappropriate reflection.The isotropy subgroup corresponding to the rotation axis contains the rotations\nby 2pi\/3 and also the reflections composed with \u03c4. It is therefore isomorphic to D3. These 4 maximal\nisotropy subgroups lead to 8 families of relative equilibria, as described above.\nIn addition to the maximal isotropy subgroups this action also has 3 further non-trivial sub-\nmaximal isotropy subgroups. Each of these is isomorphic to Z2 and is generated by a reflection\ncomposed with \u03c4. Their fixed point sets in so(3)\u2217 are planes perpendicular to the corresponding re-\nflection axes. The three planes intersect along the 3-fold rotation axis. In O\u00b5 \u223c= S2 these fixed point\nsets become circles, each containing the two points fixed by the 3-fold rotations. The operator \u03c4 maps\neach of these circles to itself and so the restrictions to them of the functions h\u00b5 must have at least 4\ncritical points. Thus there must be at least two critical points with each of these sub-maximal isotropy\nsubgroups. These give at least another 3 pairs of families of relative equilibria.\n14 J.A. MONTALDI & R.M. ROBERTS\n2.3 The Moncrief Decomposition\nTo prove Theorems 2.1 and 2.7 we first describe the local geometry of the reduction process by using\na well-known splitting of the tangent space TxP (sometimes called the Moncrief decomposition [11];\nsee also [13] for the more general setting away from J = 0). For x = (0,q) \u2208 P let\nWq := g.q \u2282 TqC \u2282 TxP\nbe the tangent space to the group orbit through x. Let\nS\n\u2217\nq := ann(Wq) \u2282 T \u2217q C \u2282 TxP ,\nwhere ann(W ) is the annihilator of W in the dual space. Using the kinetic energy metric (or any other\nG-invariant Riemannian metric on C ), we put,\nSq := (Wq)\u22a5 \u2282 TqC \u2282 TxP ,\nZq := ann(Sq) \u2282 T \u2217q C \u2282 TxP .\nWe have explicitly identified T \u2217q C with a subset of TxP , which is allowed since T \u2217q C \u2243 Tx(T \u2217q C )\u2282 TxP .\nThe space Sq is a slice to the G-action on C .\nNote that the pairing of T \u2217q C with TqC identifies S\u2217q with the dual of Sq (hence the notation), and\nZq with the dual of Wq. Finally, define\nYq := Sq\u2295S\u2217q . (2.2)\nThe space Yq \u2282 TxP is called the symplectic slice for the G-action at x (denoted S by Marsden [11]).\nNote also that since the Riemannian metric was assumed to be G-invariant, the spaces Wq,S\u2217q ,Sq,Zq\nare Gq-invariant. We have an isomorphism of Gq-representations:\nTxP \u223c= Wq\u2295Yq\u2295Zq. (2.3)\nThe time reversal operator \u03c4 fixes x = (0,q) and so also acts on TxP . With respect to the decom-\nposition given by (2.2) and (2.3), the action is\n\u03c4(w,s,\u03c3,z) = (w,s,\u2212\u03c3,\u2212z).\nThe symplectic form on this decomposition is given by\n\u03c9((w1,s1,\u03c31,z1), (w2,s2,\u03c32,z2)) = \u3008z2,w1\u3009\u2212\u3008z1,w2\u3009+ \u3008\u03c32,s1\u3009\u2212\u3008\u03c31,s2\u3009 .\nConsequently (or by differentiating (2.1)), the linear part of the momentum map at x = (0,q) is given\nby \u2329\ndJ(0,q)(w,s,\u03c3,z),\u03be\n\u232a\n:= \u03c9(X\u03be(0,q),(w,s,\u03c3,z)) =\n\u2329\nz,X\u03be(q)\n\u232a\n. (2.4)\nThe main properties of this decomposition of TxP are given in the following proposition.\nProposition 2.6 For a free action of G0, we have the following isomorphisms of Gq\u00d7Z\u03c42 representa-\ntions\nWq \u2243 g\nZq \u2243 g\u2217\nYq \u2243 TqQ\/g\u2295 (TqQ\/g)\u2217.\nHere Gq acts on g by the adjoint representation and on g\u2217 by the coadjoint representation. The group\nZ\u03c42 acts on both spaces by \u2212I. The linear part dJx of the momentum map at x = (0,q) provides the\nisomorphism dJx : Zq \u223c\u2212\u2192 g\u2217.\nRELATIVE EQUILIBRIA OF MOLECULES 15\nProof The isomorphisms are immediate consequences of the definitions. For example, the first one\nis provided by g \u2192Wq, \u03be 7\u2192 X\u03be(q); the fact that it is a Gq\u00d7Z\u03c42 isomorphism, is just the fact that the\nG\u00d7Z\u03c42-action is indeed an action. The second part follows immediately from (2.4). 2\nWe can use the Moncrief decomposition to give a local description of the reduced spaces P\u00b5 in a\nneighbourhood of x = (0,q). The isotropy subgroup of G\u0302 at x is \u0393\u0302 \u223c= \u0393\u00d7Z\u03c42. Since Tx(G0.x) = Wq,\nthe orbit map pi : P \u2192 P\/G0 defines a \u0393\u0302-equivariant isomorphism,\ndpix : Yq\u2295Zq \u223c\u2212\u2192 Tpi(x)(P\/G0).\nMoreover the momentum map (2.1) is a submersion P \u2192 g\u2217, so we can use the G\u0302-invariant Rie-\nmannian metric to identify Yq \u2282 ker(dJx) with a \u0393\u0302-invariant submanifold of J\u22121(0) transverse to the\nG0-orbit, which we also denote Yq. We can similarly identify Zq with a submanifold of P transverse\nto J\u22121(0), which is also denoted Zq. Then pi : Yq\u00d7Zq \u2192 P\/G0 is a \u0393\u0302-equivariant isomorphism onto\nits image, a neighbourhood of x. Moreover, the restriction of J to Zq is also an isomorphism onto its\nimage and we have,\nj : Yq\u00d7g\u2217 \u2212\u2192 g\u2217\/G0\n(y , \u03bd) 7\u2192 O\u03bd,\nwhere we have used J to identify Zq with g\u2217. Thus, in a neighbourhood of the point x = (0,q),\nP\u00b5 = j\u22121(O\u00b5)\u223c=\n{\n(y,\u03bd) \u2208 Yq\u00d7g\u2217 | \u03bd \u2208 O\u00b5\n}\n= Yq\u00d7O\u00b5. (2.5)\nThis isomorphism is equivariant with respect to the natural actions of \u0393\u0302\u00b5, the isotropy subgoup at \u00b5\nfor the action of \u0393\u0302 on g\u2217. The symplectic slice Yq has a natural symplectic structure induced from that\non TxP , and the isomorphism between P\/G0 and Yq \u00d7 g\u2217 identifies the natural Poisson structure on\nP\/G0 with the product Poisson structure on Yq\u00d7g\u2217. For more details see [12, 18].\nThe G-equivariant, time reversible flow generated by a G\u0302-invariant Hamiltonian function H on P\ninduces a flow on each of the reduced spaces P\u00b5 which commutes with the action of \u03a0(G\u00b5) and is\ntime reversible with respect to the action of elements of \u03a0(G\u0302\u00b5)\\\u03a0(G\u00b5). This flow is generated by the\nrestriction to P\u00b5 of the function on P\/G0 induced by H. We will denote this reduced Hamiltonian by\nH\u00b5. In the neighbourhood of a point x = (0,q) identifying P\/G0 with Yq \u00d7 g\u2217 enables us to identify\nthe induced function on P\/G0 with a \u0393\u0302 invariant function on Yq \u00d7 g\u2217 and the reduced Hamiltonians\nH\u00b5 with the restrictions of this function to the symplectic manifolds Yq \u00d7O\u00b5. Explicit forms for the\nreduced Hamiltonians H\u00b5 for molecular Hamiltonians are obtained in Section 3. The method used\nthere extends in a straightforward way to any Hamiltonian which is the sum of a non-degenerate\nquadratic kinetic energy function and a potential energy function.\n2.4 Main Theorem\nLet H : P \u2192 R be a G\u0302 = G\u00d7Z\u03c42-invariant function, where G is a compact Lie group acting on C and\nby the lift of this action on P = T \u2217C and Z\u03c42 acts as above. Suppose that G0, the connected component\nof the identity of G, acts freely on P in a neighbourhood of an orbit G0.x where x = (0,q). From\n\u00a7 2.3, near G0.x we have a \u0393\u0302-equivariant isomorphism P\/G0 \u2243 Y \u2295Z where Y is a symplectic slice\nat x and Z \u2243 g\u2217. This isomorphism restricts to symplectic isomorphisms of reduced phase spaces,\nP\u00b5 \u2243 Y \u00d7O\u00b5.\nThe dynamics on P\/G0 are determined by the \u03a0(G\u0302)-invariant quotient function H : P\/G0 \u2192 R.\nThe relative equilibria with momentum \u00b5 are given by the critical points of the restriction H\u00b5 = H P\u00b5.\n16 J.A. MONTALDI & R.M. ROBERTS\nUsing the identifications described in \u00a7 2.3 we can regard HG0 as a \u0393\u0302-invariant function on Y \u2295g\u2217 and\nH\u00b5 as a \u0393\u0302\u00b5-invariant function on Y \u2295O\u00b5.\nRemark Although for simplicity we have restricted attention to the cotangent bundle setting, the\ntheorem below holds under the more general setting of an arbitrary symplectic manifold with a locally\nfree \u2018pseudo-symplectic\u2019 action of a compact Lie group G\u0302 (that is, g\u2217\u03c9 =\u00b1\u03c9 for each g \u2208 G\u0302). This is\nbecause the Moncrief decomposition is still valid, although it is not defined in the same manner, see\nfor example [12, 13] or [18].\nTheorem 2.7 Suppose that H0 has a non-degenerate critical point at G0.x \u2208 P0. Identifying P\/G0\nwith Y \u00d7g\u2217, there is a smooth map \u03b4 : g\u2217\u2192 P\/G0 of the form \u03b4(\u00b5) = (\u03b41(\u00b5),\u00b5) such that the condition\ndyH(y,\u00b5) = 0 (2.6)\nis satisfied if and only if y = \u03b41(\u00b5). Let h = H \u25e6\u03b4 : g\u2217 \u2192 R. Then\n1. \u03bd \u2208 O\u00b5 is a critical point of h\u00b5 = h\nO\u00b5\nif and only if \u03b4(\u03bd) \u2208 P\/G0 is a relative equilibrium for H,\nand moreover every relative equilibrium is of this form. (This implies Theorem 2.1.)\n2. There exists a \u0393\u0302- equivariant diffeomorphism \u03a6 of P\/G0 of the form\n\u03a6(y,\u00b5) = (\u03c6(y,\u00b5),\u00b5),\nsatisfying\nH \u25e6\u03a6(y,\u00b5) = Q(y)+h(\u00b5),\nwhere Q(y) = 12 d2H0(0) is a non-degenerate quadratic form.\n3. If the identification of P\/G0 with Y \u00d7g\u2217 is such that d2H(0,0) splits (that is, all the mixed par-\ntial derivatives vanish: \u22022H\u2202yi\u2202\u00b5 j (0,0) = 0) then \u03b41 is of order O(\u00b52) and the linear approximation\nto \u03a6 at (0,0) can be chosen to be the identity.\nHere and elsewhere we write O(\u00b5k) to mean O(\u2016\u00b5\u2016k) for the vector variable \u00b5.\nNote that although \u03a6 decouples the reduced Hamiltonian into a sum of independent functions on Y\nand O\u00b5, it does not preserve the natural product symplectic structure on Y \u00d7O\u00b5, so the corresponding\nvector field is not decoupled.\nProof For the purposes of this proof, we write H\n\u00b5\nfor H Y \u00d7{\u00b5}. This is not to be confused with\nH\u00b5 = H T \u00d7O\u00b5.\nFirst note that since dH0(0) = 0 and Q := d2H0(0) is non-degenerate, it follows from the implicit\nfunction theorem that for each sufficiently small \u00b5 there is a unique point \u03b41(\u00b5) near y = 0 such that\ndH\n\u00b5\n(\u03b41(\u00b5)) = 0. We put \u03b4(\u00b5) = (\u03b41(\u00b5),\u00b5).\nThe theorem follows essentially from the equivariant splitting lemma, or equivariant parametrized\nMorse lemma. For \u00b5 near 0, we have a function H\n\u00b5\nwith a non-degenerate critical point at y =\n\u03b41(\u00b5), so by the equivariant Morse lemma, there is an equivariant diffeomorphism y 7\u2192 \u03c6\u00b5(y) such\nthat H\n\u00b5\n\u25e6 \u03c6\u00b5 = Q + const, where const is a constant depending on \u00b5, and is just the value of H \u00b5 at\n\u03b4(\u00b5) = \u03c6\u00b5(0). The point of the equivariant splitting lemma is that this procedure can be carried out\nsmoothly and equivariantly in \u00b5. The constant depending on \u00b5 is also smooth, and is equal to h(\u00b5).\nWriting \u03a6(y,\u00b5) = (\u03c6\u00b5(y),\u00b5) we have part (2) of the theorem.\nRELATIVE EQUILIBRIA OF MOLECULES 17\nFor part (3), if d2H splits then H is already in the desired form up to order 2, and so the linear part\nof \u03b41 vanishes and the linear part of \u03a6 can be chosen equal to the identity.\nFor part (1), let \u03bd \u2208 O\u00b5. The function H\u00b5 = H Y \u00d7O\u00b5 has a critical point at (y,\u03bd) if and only if the\nderivatives of H\u00b5 with respect to the y-variables and the O\u00b5-variables vanish. The first condition is by\ndefinition equivalent to y = \u03b41(\u03bd), and the second is then equivalent to \u03bd being a critical point of h\u00b5,\nas required. Indeed,\ndh\u00b5(\u03bd) = d(H\u00b5 \u25e6\u03b4)(\u03bd) = dyH\u00b5(\u03b4(\u03bd)).d\u03b41(\u03bd)+d\u03bdH\u00b5(\u03b4(\u03bd)),\nand by definition dyH\u00b5 vanishes at \u03b4(\u03bd). Since critical points of H\u00b5 are relative equilibria for H with\nmomentum \u00b5 (or O\u00b5), the result is proved. 2\n2.5 Stability of Relative Equilibria\nIn this subsection we relate the stability of a relative equilibrium near to the orbit G0.(0,q) with\nmomentum \u00b5 to the Morse type of the corresponding critical point of the function h\u00b5 on the coadjoint\norbit O\u00b5.\nRecall that a relative equilibrium with J = \u00b5 is an equilibrium point of the flow on Y\u00d7O\u00b5 generated\nby H\u00b5. A critical point \u03bd0 of h\u00b5 corresponds to a relative equilibrium \u03b4(\u03bd0) = (\u03b41(\u03bd0),\u03bd0).\nIn practice the critical points of the functions h\u00b5 occur in smooth families bifurcating from 0 as\n||\u00b5|| increases. We therefore assume that \u03bd0 = \u03bd0(s) and \u00b5 = \u00b5(s) are continuous curves in g\u2217 such\nthat ||\u00b5(s)||= s and \u03bd0(s) \u2208 O\u00b5(s) is a critical point of h\u00b5(s).\nRecall that Q = 12 d2H0(0) (as in Theorem 2.7). The linearization near the equilbrium is thus\ngiven by L0 = 2JY (0)Q. The following theorem relates the stability of nearby relative equilibria to the\nstability of L0 and the type of critical point of h\u00b5 at \u03bd0. Recall also that an infinitesimally symplectic\nmatrix L is said to be:\n\u2022 spectrally stable if all its eigenvalues are pure imaginary,\n\u2022 linearly stable if it is spectrally stable and semisimple, and\n\u2022 strongly stable if it lies in the interior of the set of linearly stable infinitesimally symplectic matrices.\nIn particular L0 = 2JY (0)Q is strongly stable if Q is definite. If the Hamiltonian function H is of the\n\u201ckinetic energy + potential energy\u201d type then this is equivalent to the orbit G0.x of equilibrium points\nbeing a nondegenerate critical orbit of local minima of the potential energy function. If the orbit is a\nnondegenerate saddle or maximum then L0 is unstable.\nTheorem 2.8 The following statements hold for \u03bd0 = \u03bd0(s) and \u00b5 = \u00b5(s) when s is sufficiently small.\n1. If Q is positive definite and \u03bd0 is a strict local minimum of h\u00b5 then \u03b4(\u03bd0) is Liapounov stable.\n2. If L0 is unstable then \u03b4(\u03bd0) is linearly and nonlinearly unstable.\n3. If L0 is strongly stable and the coadjoint orbits in g\u2217 are two dimensional then \u03b4(\u03bd0) is\n(a) strongly stable (elliptic) if \u03bd0 is a nondegenerate local extremum of h\u00b5;\n(b) linearly and nonlinearly unstable (hyperbolic) if \u03bd0 is a nondegenerate saddle point of h\u00b5.\n18 J.A. MONTALDI & R.M. ROBERTS\nProof Recall that there exists a change of coordinates \u03a6 on Y \u00d7g\u2217 such that H\u00b5(\u03a6(y,\u03bd)) = Q(y)+\nh\u00b5(\u03bd). If Q is positive definite and \u03bd0 is a strict local minimum of h\u00b5 then (0,\u03bd0) is a strict local\nminimum of Q(u) + h\u00b5(\u03bd). This property is preserved by the diffeomorphism \u03a6 and so \u03b4(\u03bd0) is a\nstrict local minimum of H\u00b5. It must therefore be Liapounov stable. This proves 1.\nFor the remaining statements we need to estimate the eigenvalues of the linearization of the vector\nfield at \u03b4(\u03bd0) generated by H\u00b5. This satisfies\nL(\u03b4(\u03bd0)) = J(\u03b4(\u03bd0))d2H\u00b5(\u03b4(\u03bd0)) (2.7)\nwhere J(\u03b4(\u03bd0)) is the Poisson structure on Y \u00d7O\u00b5 at (\u03b4(\u03bd0)). From \u00a7 2.3 this is the product structure\nJ(\u03b4(\u03bd0)) =\n(\nJY (\u03b41(\u03bd0)) 0\n0 J\u00b5(\u03bd0)\n)\nwhere JY is the Poisson structure on Y given by its symplectic form and J\u00b5 is the restriction to O\u00b5 of\nthe natural Poisson structure on g\u2217:\nJ\u00b5(\u03bd0)\u03be = ad\u2217\u03be\u03bd0. (2.8)\nAs s \u2192 0 we have\nJY (\u03b41(\u03bd0(s)))\u2192 JY (0); J\u00b5(\u03bd0(s))\u2192 0\nand\nL(\u03b4(\u03bd0(s)))\u2192 L(0) = L0\u22950.\nThe nondegeneracy of Q implies that the eigenvalues of L0 are non zero. The eigenvalues of L(\u03b4(\u03bd0(s)))\ntherefore form two distinct groups, those that are perturbations of eigenvalues of L0 and those that are\nperturbations of 0.\nIf L0 is unstable, then it has eigenvalues with non-zero real part, and hence so must L(\u03b4(\u03bd0(s)))\nfor sufficiently small s. This proves 2.\nIf L0 is strongly stable then its eigenvalues all lie on the imaginary axis, as do the eigenvalues of\nany small perturbation of L0. It follows that the corresponding eigenvalues of L(\u03b4(\u03bd0(s))) will remain\non the imaginary axis for all sufficiently small s. To complete the proof of the theorem we need to\ndetermine what happens to the eigenvalues that perturb from 0.\nThe change of coordinates \u03a6 transforms d2H\u00b5(\u03b4(\u03bd0(s))) to 2Q\u2295 d2h\u00b5(s)(\u03bd0(s)). If \u03bd0(s) is a\nnondegenerate critical point of h\u00b5(s) then 2Q\u2295d2h\u00b5(s)(\u03bd0(s)) will be nondegenerate and hence so will\nd2H\u00b5(s)(\u03b4(\u03bd0(s))). It follows that for s 6= 0 there will be no eigenvalues of L(\u03b4(\u03bd0(s))) at 0. If the\ncoadjoint orbits are two dimensional there are only two possibilities, either the two eigenvalues of L(0)\nat 0 perturb to a real pair or to an imaginary pair. The first will happen if and only if d2H\u00b5(\u03b4(\u03bd0(s)))\nhas a single negative eigenvalue while the second possibility occurs if it has either 0 or 2 negative\neigenvalues. The number of negative eigenvalues of d2H\u00b5((\u03b4(\u03bd0(s))) is preserved by the coordinate\nchange \u03a6 and so is equal to the number of negative eigenvalues of 2Q\u2295 d2h\u00b5(s)(\u03bd0(s)). This is 1 if\n\u03bd0(s) is a nondegenerate saddle point and 2 if it is a nondegenerate maximum and 0 if it is a non-\ndegenerate minimum. This completes the proof of 3. 2\nFor the proof of Part 3 of the Theorem it was necessary to restrict to cases (such as g\u2217 = so(3)\u2217) for\nwhich the coadjoint orbits are two dimensional. For higher dimensional cases the number of negative\neigenvalues of d2H\u00b5(\u03b4(\u03bd0)) is not sufficient to determine whether the eigenvalues of L(\u03b4(\u03bd0(s)))\nwhich perturb from 0 remain on the imaginary axis or not.\nRELATIVE EQUILIBRIA OF MOLECULES 19\n3 Calculating Relative Equilibria\nTo calculate exactly how many families of relative equilibria bifurcate from an equilibrium, and to\ndetermine their stabilities, we need to go beyond symmetry considerations and use an explicit form\nfor the Hamiltonian. The standard reduced Hamiltonian for molecules near non-collinear equilibria\nwas established by C. Eckart in 1935 [4]. We describe this in the next subsection, following very\nclosely the exposition of Sutcliffe [20] (though changing the notation somewhat). See also [1, 10].\nThen we show how the splitting lemma can be applied to compute the Taylor series of the function h\non momentum space so(3)\u2217. In the final subsections we apply this to a number of examples.\n3.1 Reduction to the Eckart Hamiltonian\nConsider a molecular equilibrium configuration Q0 \u2208 C = L0(N,3). The kinetic energy is given by,\nT = 12 tr( \u02d9QM \u02d9QT ).\nThis defines an O(3)\u00d7\u03a3-invariant Riemannian metric on C , which at Q \u2208 C is given by,\u2329\nQ\u03021, Q\u03022\n\u232a\nQ\n= tr(Q\u03021MQ\u0302T2 ), (3.1)\nfor Q\u03021, Q\u03022 \u2208 TQC . The subscript Q on the metric is redundant, but is kept to distinguish the metric\nfrom other pairings. Using this metric, we choose the slice S in C to the SO(3) orbit through Q0 to\nbe the affine linear subspace of C through Q0 orthogonal to so(3).Q0. That is,\nS :=\n{\nS \u2208 C | \u3008\u2126Q0,(S\u2212Q0)\u3009Q0 = 0, \u2200\u2126 \u2208 so(3)\n}\n.\nChoosing the slice to be orthogonal to the group orbit ensures that the Coriolis interaction matrix C\nbelow vanishes at the equilibrium; this is called the Eckart condition in the molecular spectroscopy\nliterature. Note that since the metric is SO(3)-invariant, it follows that \u3008\u2126Q0,Q0\u3009Q0 = 0, whence\n0 \u2208 S and S is a linear subspace of C . Consequently, the definition of S can be replaced by the\nsimpler expression,\nS =\n{\nS \u2208 C | \u3008\u2126Q0,S\u3009Q0 = 0, \u2200\u2126 \u2208 so(3)\n}\n. (3.2)\nBy the slice theorem, any point in C can be decomposed as a product of matrices,\nQ = AS, A \u2208 SO(3), S \u2208 S .\nAny motion Q(t) has a corresponding decomposition, which differentiates to give\n\u02d9Q = \u02d9AS +A \u02d9S = A(\u2126S + \u02d9S)\nwhere \u2126 = A\u22121 \u02d9A. The kinetic energy is then given by,\nT = 12 tr(\u2126E\u2126\nT )+ 12 tr( \u02d9SM \u02d9S\nT )+ tr(\u039b\u2126),\nwhere\nE = SMST ,\n\u039b = 12 (SM \u02d9S\nT \u2212 \u02d9SMST ).\n20 J.A. MONTALDI & R.M. ROBERTS\nNote that the inertia dyadic E is symmetric, while \u039b is skew-symmetric. Note also that, with the\nchoice of slice S we have made, if S = Q0 \u2208 S then \u039b = 0 (for all \u02d9S) by (3.2).\nWe now introduce coordinates on S by fixing a basis of matrices {S1, . . .Sn} and putting S = \u2211i siSi.\nLet Ei j = SiMSTj and define n2 symmetric matrices Ei j, n2 skew-symmetric matrices Zi j and an n\u00d7n\nmatrix N = (Ni j) by:\nEi j = 12 (Ei j +E ji),\nZi j = 12 (Ei j \u2212E ji),\nNi j = trEi j.\nThese are all constant matrices, depending only on the choice of basis in the slice S , and\nE = \u2211\ni j\nsis jEi j,\n\u039b = \u2211\ni j\nsis\u02d9 jZi j.\nWe will also find it more convenient to identify skew-symmetric matrices with R3 in the usual way.\nIf \u2126 is identified with \u03c9 then we define matrices I and C by identifying 12 (E\u2126 + \u2126E) with I\u03c9 and\ntr(\u039b\u2126) with \u03c9T Cs\u02d9. Then I is a symmetric 3\u00d7 3 matrix, the inertia tensor, and C is a 3\u00d7 n matrix\nwhich gives the Coriolis interaction between the vibrational and rotational dynamics. Note that I\ndepends quadratically on s, while C is linear and vanishes at the equilibrium configuration. In terms\nof these coordinates the kinetic energy becomes\nT = 12 \u03c9\nT I\u03c9+ 12 s\u02d9\nT Ns\u02d9+\u03c9T Cs\u02d9. (3.3)\nTo put this into Hamiltonian form we introduce the momentum variables \u00b5 and \u03c3 conjugate to \u03c9\nand s, respectively. These can be expressed in terms of the other coordinates by:\n\u00b5 = \u2202T\u2202\u03c9 = I\u03c9+Cs\u02d9\n\u03c3 = \u2202T\u2202s\u02d9 = Ns\u02d9+C\nT \u03c9.\nEliminating s\u02d9 from these equations gives\n\u00b5 = K\u22121\u03c9+pi\nwhere\nK =\n(\nI\u2212CN\u22121CT )\u22121\npi = CN\u22121\u03c3.\nSubstituting for \u03c9 and s\u02d9 in equation (3.3) gives the Hamiltonian form for the kinetic energy\nT = 12 (\u00b5\u2212pi)T K(\u00b5\u2212pi)+ 12 \u03c3T N\u22121\u03c3. (3.4)\nThe full SO(3) reduced Hamiltonian is obtained from this by simply adding the potential energy\nfunction V (s), restricted to the slice S :\nH(\u00b5,s,\u03c3) = 12 (\u00b5\u2212pi)T K(\u00b5\u2212pi)+ 12 \u03c3T N\u22121\u03c3+V (s). (3.5)\nThis is a function of \u00b5,s and \u03c3, defined on so(3)\u2217\u00d7T \u2217S , and invariant under the action of \u0393\u0302 = \u0393\u00d7Z\u03c42.\nIt is known as the Eckart Hamiltonian [4].\nRELATIVE EQUILIBRIA OF MOLECULES 21\nIt follows from (1.5) that the angular momentum J can be expressed as\nJ = A\u00b5,\n(since det(A) = 1). Hence \u00b5 can be interpreted as the angular momentum of the molecule in a coordi-\nnate system that rotates with the molecule.\n3.2 Applying the Main Theorem\nNext we must apply Theorem 2.7 to reduce the Hamiltonian (3.5) to a function h on so(3)\u2217 only. For\nsimplicity we will assume throughout the rest of this section that the equilibrium configuration Q0 is a\nnondegenerate local minimum of the restriction of the potential energy function V to the slice S . This\nimplies that the nondegeneracy hypothesis of Theorem 2.7 is satisfied and also that the unperturbed\nlinearization L0 in Theorem 2.8 is strongly stable. In fact the bifurcation results remain unchanged\nif Q0 is a nondegenerate saddle point of V , but since L0 is then unstable all the bifurcating relative\nequilibria will also be unstable.\nWe will be interested in the critical points of h when restricted to small 2-spheres around the\norigin, so we only need to compute its Taylor series to sufficiently high order. Since h is always\ninvariant under the time reversal operator \u03c4, acting by \u2212I on so(3)\u2217, all terms of odd degree must\nvanish. The following result gives general formulae for the first two non-zero terms, the quadratic h2\nand the quartic h4. These turn out to be sufficient for some, though not all, of the examples considered\nbelow.\nProposition 3.1\n1. h2(\u00b5) = 12 \u00b5\nT I(0)\u22121\u00b5;\n2. h4(\u00b5) = \u2212 116V\u221212 (\u00b5T I\u22121s (0)\u00b5,\u00b5T I\u22121s (0)\u00b5),\nwhere I(0) is the inertia tensor of the equilibrium configuration of the molecule, I\u22121s (0) is the deriva-\ntive with respect to s of the inverse inertia tensor I(s)\u22121 (regarded as a function on S ), evaluated at\nthe equilibrium configuration, V2 = 12 d2V (Q0) is the quadratic approximation to the potential energy\nfunction at the equilibrium configuration, and V\u221212 is the inverse matrix to V2.\nTo interpret the formula for h4, regard V\u221212 as a quadratic form on S\u2217, the dual to the slice, and\nI\u22121s (0) as a quadratic form on so(3)\u2217 which takes values in S\u2217. Note that I\u22121s (0) satisfies\nI\u22121s (0) = \u2212I(0)\u22121Is(0)I(0)\u22121\nwhere Is(0) is the derivative of I(s) with respect to s at the equilibrium configuration; the entries\nof Is(0) are called inertia derivatives in the molecular spectroscopy literature. If we choose a basis\n{S1, . . . ,Sn} for S , and write V\u221212 as a matrix ui j, and \u2202(I\u22121)\/\u2202si = Kiab then\nh4(\u00b51,\u00b52,\u00b53) =\u2212 116 \u2211i, j,a,b,c,d ui jKiabK jcd\u00b5a\u00b5b\u00b5c\u00b5d ,\nwhere i, j run from 1 to n and a,b,c,d from 1 to 3.\nIt follows from the propositions that h2 depends only on the inertia tensor I at the equilibrium,\nwhile h4 depends in addition on the harmonic force constants and the inertia derivatives.\n22 J.A. MONTALDI & R.M. ROBERTS\nProof Recall from Theorem 2.7 that the function h and the reduced Hamiltonian H are related by\nh(\u00b5) = H(\u03b41(\u00b5),\u00b5), (3.6)\nwhere \u03b41 satisfies dyH(\u03b41(\u00b5),\u00b5) = 0. It will be convenient to write y = (s,\u03c3) and \u03b41(\u00b5) = (s(\u00b5),\u03c3(\u00b5)).\nFor the Eckart Hamiltonian, it is clear that d2s\u00b5H(0,0,0) = 0 and d2\u03c3\u00b5H(0,0,0) = 0, so that \u03b41(\u00b5) =\nO(\u00b52), and \u03b41 is equivariant. In particular, the Z\u03c42 symmetry implies that s(\u00b5) is even and \u03c3(\u00b5) is odd,\nso \u03c3(\u00b5) = O(\u00b53).\nTo obtain the 2nd and 4th order parts of h, we use (3.6) and the explicit form of the Eckart\nHamiltonian (3.5). We use subscripts to denote Taylor series coefficients; ie fk is the order k part in\nthe Taylor series of f at the origin, where the order is defined in terms of its arguments. Then, to order\n4 in \u00b5,\nh(\u00b5) = 12 \u00b5\nT (K0 +K1(s2(\u00b5)))\u00b5+ s2(\u00b5)TV2s2(\u00b5)+O(\u00b56), (3.7)\nwhere we have used the fact that \u03c3(\u00b5) = O(\u00b53) and s(\u00b5) = O(\u00b52) which imply that all the terms\ninvolving \u03c3 are O(\u00b56), and we have represented s(\u00b5) as a vector and V2 as a symmetric matrix. Note\nthat K1(s) is the linear part of K(s), which is precisely the I\u22121s of the proposition.\nFrom this Taylor series, we see immediately that h2(\u00b5) = 12 \u00b5\nT K0\u00b5, as required in part (1).\nFor the 4th order part of h, we need to find s2(\u00b5), which can be found from the leading order part\nof (2.6):\n0 = \u2202H\u2202s (s(\u00b5),\u03c3(\u00b5),\u00b5) =\n1\n2 \u00b5\nT K1\u00b5+2V2s2(\u00b5)+O(\u00b54).\nConsequently,\ns2(\u00b5) =\u221214V\n\u22121\n2 (\u00b5\nT K1\u00b5), (3.8)\nwhere V\u221212 is considered as a linear map S\u2217 \u2192 S . Substituting for this in (3.7) gives\nh4(\u00b5) =\n1\n2\n\u00b5T (K1(s2(\u00b5)))\u00b5+ s2(\u00b5)TV2s2(\u00b5)\n= \u221218 (\u00b5\nT K1\u00b5)TV\u221212 (\u00b5\nT K1\u00b5)+\n1\n16 (\u00b5\nT K1\u00b5)TV\u221212 (\u00b5\nT K1\u00b5)\n= \u2212 1\n16 (\u00b5\nT K1\u00b5)TV\u221212 (\u00b5\nT K1\u00b5),\nas required. 2\nThe following results can be deduced from the form of h2.\nCorollary 3.2\n1. If the equilibrium configuration Q0 has three distinct principal moments of inertia then there\nare precisely six families of relative equilibria bifurcating from it. The relative equilibria have\ndynamical axes that are aligned, at least approximately, with the principal axes of the equi-\nlibrium configuration. Those corresponding to the principal axis with largest (resp. smallest)\nmoment of inertia are Liapounov stable (resp. linearly stable), while those corresponding to the\nintermediate moment of inertia are linearly unstable.\n2. If the equilibrium configuration Q0 is planar, the nearby relative equilibria with dynamical axes\nperpendicular to the plane containing the equilibrium are Liapounov stable.\nRELATIVE EQUILIBRIA OF MOLECULES 23\nProof If I(0)\u22121 has three distinct eigenvalues h2 has precisely six non-degenerate critical points\non each sphere round 0. These are at the points corresponding to the eigenvectors of I(0)\u22121. The\nmaxima, saddle points and minima are given by the eigenvectors with the smallest, middle and largest\neigenvalues, respectively. On sufficently small spheres the function h is a small perturbation of h2 and\nso will have nearby critical points. Part (1) now follows from Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 2.8.\nFor Part 2 we use the fact that the principle moment of inertia of a planar body perpendicular to\nthe plane is the sum of the other two principle moments of inertia and so must be the largest. 2\nPart (1) of this corollary states that if the molecule has little or no symmetry, and the three moments\nof inertia are distinct, then for small values of angular momentum the molecule behaves like a rigid\nbody, and the relative equilibria and their stabilities depend only on the equilibrium shape. On the\nother hand, this is not true for symmetric molecules as the examples below show.\n3.3 Non-collinear XY2 molecules\nIn Example 1.2 we noted that a non-collinear equilibrium configuration of an XY2 molecule has three\nmutually perpendicular symmetry axes, one of rotation and two of reflection. By Theorem 0.1 for each\nof these there are two families of relative equilibria bifurcating from the equilibrium with dynamical\naxes equal to the symmetry axis. These three axes are also the three principal axes of the inertia tensor\nof the equilibrium. So by Corollary 3.2 these will be the only bifurcating relative equilibria, provided\nthe three moments of inertia are different. Note that the symmetry means that the dynamical axes of\nthe relative equilibria are precisely the principal axes of the inertia tensor in this case.\nThe stability properties of the relative equilibria are also determined by the moments of inertia.\nIn particular, by the second part of Corollary 3.2, the relative equilibria rotating about the reflection\naxis perpendicular to the plane containing the equilibrium will be stable. For the other two families\nwe need to compute the corresponding moments of inertia.\nLet the distance between the X nucleus and one of the Y nuclei at equilibrium be \u2113 and the angle\nbetween the X\u2212Y bonds be 2\u03b8. Let the masses of the X and Y nuclei be mX and mY , respectively. Put\nM = mX +2mY and \u03c1 = mX\/M. Let I1 denote the moment of inertia about the reflection axis lying in\nthe plane containing the equilibrium (\u21133 in Figure 2) and I2 the moment of inertia about the rotation\naxis (\u21132 in Figure 2). Then\nI1 = M\u03c1(1\u2212\u03c1)\u21132 cos2 \u03b8\nI2 = M(1\u2212\u03c1)\u21132 sin2 \u03b8.\nThus I1 < I2 if and only if tan2 \u03b8 > \u03c1. In this case the relative equilibrium rotating about the reflection\naxis is linearly (though not Liapounov) stable, and that rotating about the rotation axis is linearly\nunstable. If tan2 \u03b8 < \u03c1 these stability properties are reversed.\nThe bond angles for over 25 XY2 molecules are listed in [8] and [9]. In all these cases it is\ngreater than 90o and so we can conclude that it is the relative equilibria with dynamical axes along\nthe reflection axis that are linearly stable, and those with dynamical axes along the rotation axis are\nlinearly unstable. However, there are also molecules with I1 > I2 such as H2D+, where \u03c1 = 1\/2 and\n2\u03b8 = 60o (D is deuterium, with mD = 2mH ), and for these the stabilities are reversed.\n3.4 Tetrahedral XY4 molecules\nIn the introduction we saw that (at least) three different types of relative equilibria bifurcate from a\ntetrahedral equilibrium configuration of an XY4 molecule such as methane (CH4). Their dynamical\naxes are, respectively, the three-fold rotation axes, the two-fold rotation axes and the reflection axes.\n24 J.A. MONTALDI & R.M. ROBERTS\nIn this subsection we will compute the quadratic and quartic terms of the function h on so(3)\u2217 and\nshow that generically these determine the stabilities of the bifurcating relative equilibria and that no\nother relative equilibria bifurcate.\nThe function h on so(3)\u2217 is invariant under the induced action of both \u0393 = Td \u223c= S4 and the time-\nreversing Z\u03c42. Together these give an action of the group of symmetries of the cube, denoted Oh,\nwhich is isomorphic to the standard action on R3. The three types of bifurcating relative equilibria\ncorrespond to the three conjugacy classes of maximal isotropy subgroups for this action, namely the\nisotropy subgroups conjugate to D3 (3-fold rotation axis denoted \u21133 in Figure 1), D4 (2-fold rotation\naxis, \u21131 in the figure) and D2 (reflection axis, \u21132 in the figure). The restriction of any Oh-invariant\nfunction to spheres centred on 0 \u2208 so(3)\u2217 must have the points with these isotropy subgroups as\ncritical points. The following proposition says that generically there won\u2019t be any others near 0, and\ndetermines the generic possibilities for their stabilities.\nProposition 3.3\n1. The quadratic and quartic terms of the Taylor series at 0 of a general Oh-invariant function h\non so(3)\u2217 have the form\nh2 = \u03b1\n(\n\u00b521 +\u00b5\n2\n2 +\u00b5\n2\n3\n)\nh4 = \u03b2(\u00b521 +\u00b522 +\u00b523)2 + \u03b3(\u00b521\u00b522 +\u00b522\u00b523 +\u00b523\u00b521) .\n2. If \u03b1,\u03b3 6= 0 then the restriction of h to a small sphere centred at 0 \u2208 so(3)\u2217 has only critical\npoints with isotropy subgroups conjugate to D4, D3 and D2.\n3. Suppose \u03b1 > 0. If \u03b3 < 0 the critical points with isotropy subgroups conjugate to D3, D2 and\nD4 are, respectively, minima, saddle points, and maxima. If \u03b3 > 0 the maxima and minima are\ninterchanged.\nProof Part (1) follows from the fact that every smooth function on R3 which is invariant under the\nstandard action of Oh is a smooth function of the polynomials \u00b521 + \u00b522 + \u00b523, \u00b521\u00b522 + \u00b522\u00b523 + \u00b523\u00b521 and\n\u00b521\u00b5\n2\n2\u00b5\n2\n3 (see for example [5, p. 48, Ex. 4.7]). Parts (2) and (3) are straightforward calculations. 2\nIt follows from this proposition and Theorem 2.8 that we should expect the relative equilibria\nwith dynamical axes equal to the reflection axis to be linearly unstable when they bifurcate from the\nequilibrium. To determine the stabilities of the other two types we need to calculate \u03b3 in terms of the\nphysical parameters of the molecule.\nLet the masses of the X nucleus and Y nuclei be mX and mY , respectively. Let \u03c1 denote the mass\nratio mY\/mX . Let \u2113 denote the distance between the X nucleus and a Y nucleus at equilibrium. The\ninertia tensor of the equilibrium configuration is then\nI(0) = 83mY \u2113\n2\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed 1 0 00 1 0\n0 0 1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 .

The columns of each matrix\ngive the coordinates of the 5 nuclei, with X in the first column. Note that the position of X is deter-\nmined by the positions of the Y \u2019s and the requirement that the centre of mass of the system is always\nat the origin. Each row of matrices defines a subspace of S on which \u0393 acts irreducibly. All the matri-\nces are orthogonal to each other and to the tangent space to the SO(3) orbit through the equilibrium\nconfiguration with respect to the inner product (3.1). The labels A, E, F1 and F2 are those commonly\nused in the molecular spectroscopy literature. The representations of \u0393 on the two Fi subspaces are\nisomorphic. The subspaces A and E are uniquely defined, but the Fi are not. We have chosen F1 to\nbe the subspace consisting of configurations in which X remains stationary. The subspace F2 is then\ndetermined by the orthogonality requirement.\nThe tetrahedral equilibrium configuration is given by:\nQ0 = \u2113\u221a3S1.\nA general configuration of the molecule in S is defined by:\nQ = Q(s) = Q0 +\n9\n\u2211\ni=1\nsiSi.\nTo compute h4 (and hence \u03b3) we need to find Is(0) and hence\nI\u22121s (0) = \u2212I(0)\u22121Is(0)I(0)\u22121.\nTo do this we compute the inertia derivatives Ii(0) (i = 1, . . . ,9) of I(s) in the directions given by\neach of the matrices listed above in the basis for S . Explicitly these are given by:\nIi(0) = tr(Ei) I\u2212Ei\nwhere Ei is the derivative of E = SMST in the direction given by the i-th basis element of S :\nEi = SiMQT0 +Q0MSTi .\n26 J.A.

It follows from Proposition 3.1\nthat:\n\u221216\nC2\nh4(\u00b5) =\n1\nC2\nV\u221212\n(\n\u00b5T I\u22121s (0)\u00b5,\u00b5T I\u22121s (0)\u00b5\n)\n= u11\n(\n\u00b521 +\u00b5\n2\n2 +\u00b5\n2\n3\n)2\n+\nu22\n4\n((\n\u00b523\u2212\u00b522\n)2\n+\n1\n3\n(\n2\u00b521\u2212\u00b522\u2212\u00b523\n)2)\n+u33\n(\n\u00b522\u00b5\n2\n3 +\u00b5\n2\n3\u00b5\n2\n1 +\u00b5\n2\n1\u00b5\n2\n2\n)\n=\n(\nu11 +\nu22\n3\n)(\n\u00b521 +\u00b5\n2\n2 +\u00b5\n2\n3\n)2\n+(u33\u2212u22)\n(\n\u00b522\u00b5\n2\n3 +\u00b5\n2\n3\u00b5\n2\n1 +\u00b5\n2\n1\u00b5\n2\n2\n)\n.\nHence \u03b3 = (u22\u2212u33)C2\/16 and the sign of this determines the stability of the relative equilibria\nwhich bifurcate from the equilibrium.\nTo obtain the values of the non-zero entries ui j in V\u221212 for specific molecules is not straight for-\nward. The methods of molecular spectroscopy determine the vibrational frequencies corresponding\nto the 4 distinct eigenvalues of V\u221212 . However this is not enough information to determine the 5 non-\nzero ui j. This problem can be side-stepped by assuming a specific form for the quadratic part of the\npotential energy function which depends on 4 parameters or less, and then using the experimentally\nRELATIVE EQUILIBRIA OF MOLECULES 27\ndetermined vibrational frequencies to estimate these. See for example the account given in [7]. As an\nexample we use the valence force potential given by:\nV2 =\nk\n2\n4\n\u2211\ni=1\nr2i +\nk\u03b4\n2 \u2211i< j \u03b4i j (3.10)\nwhere ri is the change in the distance between the X-nucleus and the i-th Y -nucleus, and \u03b4i j is the\nchange in the angle between XYi and XYj (see [7] page 181). A routine, though tedious, calculation\nshows that in the basis given above for S the quadratic form corresponding to V2 is:\nV2 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nv11\nv22I2\nv33I3 v34I3\nv34I3 v44I3\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\nwhere:\nv11 = 12k\nv22 = 24\nk\u03b4\n\u21132\nv33 =\n16\n3\n(\nk + k\u03b4\n\u21132\n)\nv34 =\n8\n3 (1+4\u03c1)\n(\nk\u22122k\u03b4\n\u21132\n)\nv44 =\n4\n3 (1+4\u03c1)\n2\n(\nk +4k\u03b4\n\u21132\n)\n.\nInverting this gives\nu22 =\n\u21132\n24k\u03b4\nu33 =\n\u21132\n48k\u03b4\n+\n1\n12k\nand hence\n\u03b3 = C\n2\n768\n(\n\u21132\nk\u03b4\n\u2212 4k\n)\n.\nThe values of k and k\u03b4\/\u21132 obtained by fitting the valence force potential (3.10) to spectroscopic data\nfrom a number of XY4 molecules (including methane) are listed in Table 46 of [7]. In all cases \u03b3 is\npositive and so we can predict that the bifurcating relative equilibria with dynamical axes along the\n2-fold rotation axes (see \u21131 in Figure 1) will be Liapounov stable, those with dynamical axes along\nthe 3-fold rotation axes (\u21133 in the figure) will be linearly stable, but typically Liapounov unstable,\nwhile those with dynamical axes along the reflection axes (\u21132 in the figure) will be linearly unstable\n(hyperbolic).\n28 J.A. MONTALDI & R.M. ROBERTS\n\u21131\n\u21132\n\u21133\nFigure 3: Representative axes for the X3 molecule\nNote that \u21131 is unique, while there are\n3 of type \u21132 and 3 of type \u21133.\n3.5 Equilateral X3 molecules\nConsider a molecule made up of 3 identical nuclei and with an equilibrium configuration with the\nnuclei at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. Examples include ozone, O3, and the ionized molecule\nH+3 , which plays an important role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium and the atmospheres\nof the giant planets [21]. For ozone the equilateral triangle equilibrium is unstable and the stable\nequilibria are isosceles. However for H+3 it is stable.\nThe symmetry group of the equilateral triangle configuration is D3\u00d7Z2, where Z2 acts by reflect-\ning in the plane of the molecule. By Theorem 0.1 relative equilibria of three types bifurcate from the\nequilibrium: rotations about the axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, rotations about axes\npassing through one of the three nuclei, and rotations about axes in the plane of the molecule which\nare perpendicular to these. This third set of axes are axes of reflection, where the reflection is in a\nplane perpendicular to that of the molecule and passing through a vertex of the equilateral triangle.\nIf the equilibrium point is unstable then all the bifurcating relative equilibria will be unstable. If\nit is stable then by Corollary 3.2(2) the relative equilibria with axes perpendicular to the plane of\nthe molecule will be Liapounov stable. Generically, one of the two remaining types will be linearly\nstable and the other linearly unstable. In this section we show how to distinguish between the two\npossibilities. We also show that generically these are the only relative equilibria that bifurcate. These\ncalculations turn out to involve computing a 6th order coefficient in the Taylor series of h, and this de-\npends on a 3rd order coefficient in the Taylor series of the potential energy function, i.e. an anharmonic\nforce constant.\nIn this case the function h on so(3)\u2217 will be invariant under the action of D3 \u00d7Z2 \u00d7Z\u03c42 given\nby equations (1.6, 1.7). For this action so(3)\u2217 splits into the direct sum of two invariant subspaces,\nthe two-dimensional space consisting of momentum values that lie in the plane of the molecule, and\nthe one-dimensional space perpendicular to this. The group D3 \u00d7Z2 is isomorphic to D6 and acts\non the two-dimensional subspace by the standard action of D6 on the plane. The action on the one-\ndimensional space is determined by the fact that the subgroup which acts trivially is Z6 \u2282 D6. As\nusual Z\u03c42 acts on so(3)\u2217 by \u2212I.\nEvery maximal isotropy subgroup of this action on the spheres centred at 0 is conjugate to one\nof the three groups D\u02dc6,Z\n(rot)\n2 \u00d7Zpi\u25e6\u03c42 or Z(ref)2 \u00d7Zpi\u25e6\u03c42 defined as follows. The subgroup D\u02dc6 consists\nof the group Z6 together with each of the remaining elements of D6 composed with \u03c4. This fixes the\nmomentum values perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. There are no other subgroups conjugate\nto this one. The subgroup Z(rot)2 is generated by rotating the molecule by pi about one of its two-fold\nRELATIVE EQUILIBRIA OF MOLECULES 29\nrotation axes (labelled \u21132 in Figure 3). The subgroup Z(ref)2 is generated by a reflection of the molecule\nin one of the reflection planes perpendicular to the plane containing the molecule, with axis \u21131. The\ngroup Zpi\u25e6\u03c42 is generated by rotating the molecule by pi about its three-fold rotation axis and then\napplying \u03c4. These three order two subgroups of D6\u00d7Z\u03c42 are not conjugate to each other. Each of the\ngroups Z(rot)2 \u00d7Zpi\u25e6\u03c42 and Z(ref)2 \u00d7Zpi\u25e6\u03c42 has two other subgroups conjugate to it. The fixed point sets\nfor each of these subgroups is a line in the plane of the molecule. Thus there are 7 maximal isotropy\nsubgroups altogether, each of which will have two fixed points on the spheres in so(3)\u2217.\nProposition 3.4\n1. The quadratic, quartic and sextic terms in the Taylor series at 0 of a general D3 \u00d7Z2 \u00d7Z\u03c42-\ninvariant function h on so(3)\u2217 have the form\nh2 = \u03b11(\u00b521 +\u00b522)+\u03b12\u00b523,\nh4 = \u03b21(\u00b521 +\u00b522)2 +\u03b22(\u00b521 +\u00b522)\u00b523 +\u03b23\u00b543,\nh6 = \u03b3(\u00b531\u22123\u00b51\u00b522)2 +\n3\n\u2211\ni=0\n\u03b3i(\u00b521 +\u00b522)i(\u00b523)3\u2212i.\n2. If \u03b11 6= \u03b12 and \u03b3 6= 0 then the restriction of h to a small sphere centred at 0 \u2208 so(3)\u2217 has\nprecisely 14 critical points; they have isotropy subgroups conjugate to D\u02dc6 (2), Z(rot)2 \u00d7Zpi\u25e6\u03c42 (6)\nand Z(ref)2 \u00d7Zpi\u25e6\u03c42 (6).\n3. If h is the split Hamiltonian of an X3-molecule then \u03b12 = 12 \u03b11 > 0, and the critical points\n\u00b5 = (0,0,\u00b11) with isotropy subgroups conjugate to D\u02dc6 are minima. Moreover, if \u03b3 > 0 the\ncritical points in the orbit of (1,0,0) (with isotropy subgroups conjugate to Z(rot)2 \u00d7Zpi\u25e6\u03c42 ) are\nmaxima while those in the orbit of (0,1,0) (with isotropy subgroups conjugate to Z(ref)2 \u00d7Zpi\u25e6\u03c42 )\nare saddle points; if \u03b3 < 0 the maxima and saddles are interchanged.\nProof The first part is a straightforward invariant theory calculation (see eg [5]). Part (2) follows\nfrom the discussion before the statement of the proposition together with a computation to verify that\nthere are no other critical points, and part (3) is a computation. 2\nPart (3) of this proposition is used in conjunction with Theorem 2.8 to determine the stabilities of\nthe relative equilibria. We now consider the X3 molecule in general, and perform the computations\nneeded to determine the sign of \u03b3.\nLet m be the mass of the X nuclei, and \u2113 the equilibrium bond length.

Since V is \u0393-invariant, its third order Taylor series can be\nwritten\nV (s1,s2,s3) = As21 +B(s22 + s23)+Cs31 +Ds1(s22 + s23)+E(s32\u22123s2s23)+O(s4). (3.11)\nHere A,B are harmonic force constants, while C,D,E are anharmonic force constants.\nRecall from (3.8) that the quadratic part of s(\u00b5) satisfies\ns2(\u00b5) =\u221214V\n\u22121\n2 (\u00b5\nT K1\u00b5),\n(there should be no confusion arising from using s2 both as a coordinate in (3.11) and the quadratic\npart of a function). Combining this with the expressions for (K1)i = I\u22121i (0) above gives\ns1,2(\u00b5) =\n1\nAm\u21133\n(\u00b521 +\u00b5\n2\n2 +\n1\n2 \u00b5\n2\n3)\ns2,2(\u00b5) = \u2212 1Bm\u21133 (\u00b5\n2\n1\u2212\u00b522)\ns3,2(\u00b5) = \u2212 2Bm\u21133 \u00b51\u00b52.\nRELATIVE EQUILIBRIA OF MOLECULES 31\nwhere si,2 is the quadratic part of si. Substituting for this in (2.6) gives s4(\u00b5) and \u03c33(\u00b5). The expres-\nsions for s2,s4 and \u03c33 are then substituted in the expression for h. Finally, comparing with Proposi-\ntion 3.4 shows that \u03b3 is given by\n\u03b3 = 16!\n(\u22026h\n\u2202\u00b561\n\u2212 \u2202\n6h\n\u2202\u00b562\n)\n.\nAll these computations are quite lengthy, and can most easily be performed with the aid of a computer\npackage (again, we use MAPLE). The final result is\n\u03b3 = 197 E3m3\u21139B3 ,\nwhere B,E are the force constants defined in (3.11). For a stable equilibrium B > 0 and so the sign of\n\u03b3 coincides with that of E.\nAs an example consider a system of three identical point masses coupled by three identical linear\nsprings with spring constant k > 0, and equilibrium length \u2113. Then expressing the extensions of the\nthree springs in terms of the slice coordinates s1,s2,s3, gives\n\u03b3 =\u22129k\n4\u2113\n.\nIt follows from Proposition 3.4 and Theorem 2.8 that the rotation about an axis passing through one\nof the point masses is linearly unstable (axis \u21132 in Figure 3), while rotation about the orthogonal one\n(axis \u21133) is linearly stable, and indeed strongly stable.\nTo apply these calculations to the H+3 molecule, we need to know the potential energy function.\nThe Taylor series to order 7 of this function at the equilibrium has been estimated from spectroscopic\ndata in [2]. The coordinates they use are not the same as ours, and in our coordinates, their coefficients\nbecome (cf. (3.11))\nA = 225291, B = 146892,\nC = \u2212234030, D = \u2212389483, E = \u2212104648.\nIn particular, E < 0 and consequently so is \u03b3. It follows that of the two horizontal axes, the one\nthrough a nucleus (axis \u21132 in Figure 3) is linearly unstable (hyperbolic) while the other is strongly\nstable (elliptic), precisely as for the linear spring model.\nThe world of molecules is very rich, and one would expect that there is an X3 molecule where the\nstabilities differ from those of the linear spring model, but we do not know of such an example.\nReferences\n[1] M.R.
