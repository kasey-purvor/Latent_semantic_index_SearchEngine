The existence of this mini neutron star leaves a clear imprint on the gravitational\nwave signal which thus can be used to probe the physics at supranuclear densities.\nKey words: accretion, accretion discs \u2013 dense matter \u2013 methods: numerical \u2013 stars: neutron.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nNeutron star\u2013black hole binaries are thought to be excellent can-\ndidates for ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detection (e.g.\nBelczynski, Kalogera & Bulik 2002, and references therein). If their\ntrue coalescence rate is close to the upper end of the estimated values,\nneutron star\u2013black hole systems may be among the first sources de-\ntected. They are further \u2013 together with double neutron star systems\n\u2013 the favoured model for the subclass of short gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs; Paczynski 1992; Narayan, Pazcynski & Piran 1992); a co-\nincident detection of a GW \u2018chirp\u2019 signal together with a GRB could\nbe the ultimate proof for the compact binary nature of the short GRB\nprogenitors. Moreover, the cold decompression of nuclear matter by\nthe tidal disruption of a neutron star has been considered as a pos-\nsible production site of rapid neutron capture elements (Lattimer &\nSchramm 1974, 1976; Lattimer et al. 1977; Symbalisty & Schramm\n1982; Eichler et al. 1989; Rosswog et al. 1999; Freiburghaus,\nRosswog & Thielemann 1999).\nFull general relativistic simulations of this event are very chal-\nlenging as apart from the complicated neutron star physics the dy-\nnamic evolution of the space\u2013time must also be followed since the\nsystems of interest have comparable masses for both binary compo-\nnents and therefore a fixed space\u2013time cannot be assumed. But the\ndynamics of the event is demanding enough even if treated in the\nNewtonian approximation. Simulations of neutron star\u2013black hole\nencounters have been described in a series of papers by Lee and Lee\nand Kluzniak (Lee & Kluzniak 1999a,b; Lee 2000, 2001). They\nused three-dimensional (3D) smoothed particle hydrodynamics,\n\u0003E-mail: s.rosswog@iu-bremen.de\nNewtonian self-gravity plus back-reaction forces from GW emis-\nsion and polytropic equations of state (EOS) of varying stiffness.\nJanka et al. (1999) performed neutron star\u2013black hole merger calcu-\nlations using a 3D Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM) code, again\nusing Newtonian self-gravity plus back-reaction forces, but with the\nnuclear EOS of Lattimer & Swesty (1991) and a detailed neutrino\ntreatment (Ruffert, Janka & Scha\u00a8fer 1996).\nThe focus of our investigation in this paper is the complex ac-\ncretion dynamics in a neutron star\u2013black hole system. Many of the\n(analytical) approximations that are successfully used in other ac-\ncreting systems are of only limited value in this context. For ex-\nample, the Roche potential of point mass binaries is only a rough\napproximation to the neutron star with its rather flat density profile;\nneutron star\u2013black hole binaries are most likely not corotating like\nother close binaries (Bildsten & Cutler 1992) and, owing to their\ntiny pressure scale heights in the neutron star surface, \u2018standard\u2019\nestimates of the distance where mass transfer sets in can only give\na very rough guideline.\nWe present in Section 2 analytic estimates that explain why ir-\nrotational donor stars do generally form accretion discs easier than\ncorotating donors. We explain in Section 3 our numerical methods\nand initial conditions, results concerning the accretion dynamics\nand the corresponding GW emission are presented in Section 4. In\nSection 5 we summarize our results.\n2 A NA LY T I C E S T I M AT E S\nWhile the GW signature is predominantly determined by the bulk\nmotion of the event, the neutrino and electromagnetic signals from\na neutron star\u2013black hole system require an accretion disc to form.\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS\n by guest on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1122 S.

Mass\u2013radius relationship for the Shen EOS used: for neutron star\nmasses above 0.4 M\u0003 the neutron star will shrink upon mass loss, below\nthis value it will increase its radius.\nMoreover an accretion disc is thought to be an indispensable ingre-\ndient for a GRB central engine (e.g. Piran 1999; Me\u00b4sza\u00b4ros 2002).\nTherefore we explore with simple analytical formulae the conditions\nunder which a disc can form.\nWe want to point out the fact that the following estimates only are\nillustrative in character as they are very approximate for two reasons:\nfirst, the used formulae refer to Roche geometry, i.e. to the gravity\nof point masses, while the stiff neutron star EOS leads to an almost\nuniform mass distribution inside the neutron star. Secondly, and\nmore importantly, the stiff neutron star EOS results in tiny pressure\nscale heights in the neutron star surface and therefore the level of\nuncertainty in the estimate of the Roche radius can easily correspond\nto several orders of magnitude in terms of pressure scale heights.\nThe dynamics of how the mass transfer proceeds depends cru-\ncially on the way the neutron star reacts on mass loss, i.e. whether\nit shrinks or expands. The mass\u2013radius relationship of a polytropic\nneutron star with adiabatic exponent \u0004 is given by (e.g. Kippenhahn\n& Weigert 1990)\nR \u221d M (\u0004\u22122)\/(3\u0004\u22124), (1)\ni.e. for \u0004 = 2 the radius is independent of the mass and for larger\n(smaller) values the neutron star shrinks (expands) on mass loss. For\na realistic nuclear EOS \u0004 is density dependent (for an example see\nthe comparison between the Shen- and the Lattimer\u2013Swesty EOS\nin Rosswog & Davies 2002, fig. 5) and therefore the reaction of the\nneutron star on mass loss depends on its current mass. The mass\u2013\nradius relationship of the used Shen EOS is given in Fig. 1. Above\n0.4 M\u0003 a neutron star will shrink upon mass loss, below this value\nits radius increases.\n2.1 Accretion disc formation: dependence on donor spin\nWe show that \u2013 and explain why \u2013 it is in general easier to form an\naccretion disc owing to Roche lobe overflow, if the donor star is non-\nrotating rather than being tidally locked. In the non-rotating case,\nmatter flowing across the Lagrange point L1 has a larger specific an-\ngular momentum and therefore yields a larger circularization radius\nthan in the corotating case. As a consequence, in the first case more\nmatter can form an accretion disc outside the Schwarzschild radius,\nwhile for a corotating donor the bulk of material is fed directly into\nthe hole.\nFor the sake of simplicity we assume in the following that the\nRoche potential is a valid approximation for our purposes. We fur-\nther neglect radial velocities of the binary components and tidal\ndeformations and lag angles of the donor star. Generally, the circu-\nlarization radius is an estimate for the initial disc size. It is propor-\ntional to the square of the specific angular momentum, lL1 , of the\naccretion stream at the L1 point as measured in a coordinate system\n(\u0006) with non-rotating axes and the origin centred on the black hole\nRcirc = l2L1\/(G MBH), (2)\nwhere MBH is the mass of the black hole. Therefore, we have to\nshow that the irrotational case yields a larger value for lL1 , i.e. l irrL1\n> lcorrL1 . The specific angular momentum is defined as l L1 = b1 \u00d7\nvL1 , where b1 is the vector from the black hole to the L1 point. The\nvelocities at the L1 point are easiest found in a coordinate system (\u0006\u2032)\ncorotating with the binary centred around the black hole. Here and\nin the following, all unprimed quantities refer to \u0006, while primed\nones refer to \u0006\u2032. The coordinate transformation between the two\nsystems is given by\nx = R\u03d5x\u2032 (3)\nv = \u03c9 \u00d7 x + R\u03d5v\u2032, (4)\nwhere R\u03d5 is the matrix describing a rotation around \u03c9. The rotation\nangle \u03d5 is given by \u03c9t, where \u03c9 = |\u03c9| is the binary orbital angular\nvelocity.\nFor a corotating donor star all the fluid velocities vanish in the\ncorotating frame \u0006\u2032, i.e. v\u2032 = 0. Hence, the velocity at L1 in \u0006 reads\nvL1 = \u03c9\u00d7b1 (5)\nand therefore\nlcorrL1 = b21\u03c9. (6)\nAn irrotational donor star, however, appears in \u0006\u2032 to be spinning\nagainst the orbital motion with \u03c9spin = \u2212\u03c9,\nv\u2032L1 = \u2212 \u03c9\u00d7 (b1 \u2032 \u2212 a\u2032), (7)\nwhere a\u2032 denotes the vector pointing from the black hole to the\nneutron star. Inserting equation (7) into equation (4) and considering\nequation (3) leads to\nvL1 = \u03c9 \u00d7 a (8)\nand finally\nl irrL1 = b1a\u03c9. (9)\nObviously, as l irrL1 > l\ncorr\nL1 , we have\nRirrcirc > R\ncorr\ncirc . (10)\nUsing equation (2) and Kepler\u2019s third law the circularization radii\ncan be written as\nRcorrcirc = (1 + q)b1\n\/(\nb1\na\n)3\n(11)\nRirrcirc = (1 + q)b1\n\/(\nb1\na\n)\n, (12)\nwhere q = M NS\/M BH (MNS is the neutron star mass). We now\nassume that mass transfer sets in once the (unperturbed) neutron\nstar radius, RNS, is comparable to its Roche radius. The accretion\nstream from the neutron star to the black hole will result in a disc\nif the stream tries to settle outside the Schwarzschild radius of the\nhole, RSS, i.e. if R circ > RSS. We plot in Fig. 2 the conditions under\nwhich a disc can form, for both the corotating and the irrotational\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 351, 1121\u20131133\n by guest on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nNeutron star\u2013black hole binaries 1123\nFigure 2.

The upper panel refers to the case of a corotating donor\nstar, while the lower is for a neutron star without spin.\ncases. To produce the plot we have used the formula of Plavec &\nKratochvil (1964) to estimate b1, the Roche radius is approximated\naccording to Eggleton (1983), and for the radius of the neutron star\nas a function of mass we use the (cold, T = 0) EOS of Shen et al.\n(1998a,b); see Fig. 1. The grey-shaded area refers to the condition\nR circ > RSS and the black area to R circ > R isco = 6 M BH. R isco is the\nradius of the innermost, stable circular orbit of a test particle around\na Schwarzschild black hole.\nAlthough these are just rough estimates, Fig. 2 clearly shows\nhow difficult it is to form an accretion disc for a corotating 1.4 M\u0003\nneutron star: only for extremely low-mass black hole cases (2 M\u0003)\nwill the accretion stream settle in a disc around the hole. In the more\nrealistic case of a more massive hole the accretion stream will be\nfed directly into the hole and only form a disc once the neutron\nstar has expanded on mass loss. In the irrotational case, however,\nthe fraction of the parameter space that allows for an accretion disc\nformation is much larger. From a 1.4 M\u0003 neutron star an accretion\ndisc will form even for a black hole as massive as \u223c18 M\u0003.\nAll these results are generally confirmed by the set of numerical\nsimulations presented in Section 4.\n3 M O D E L\n3.1 Numerical method\nWe solve the equations of fluid dynamics in 3D using a Lagrangian\nparticle scheme (smoothed particle hydrodynamics, SPHs; see e.g.\nBenz 1990; Monaghan 1992). For details of the equations (sym-\nmetrization etc.) we refer to the review by Benz (1990). Rather than\nthe \u2018standard\u2019 artificial viscosity (Monaghan & Gingold 1983) we\nuse (Rosswog et al. 2000) time-dependent viscosity parameters that\nessentially vanish in the absence of shocks, together with the so-\ncalled \u2018Balsara switch\u2019 (Balsara 1995) to suppress spurious viscous\nforces in pure shear flows. For further details of the implemen-\ntation we refer to Rosswog & Davies (2002). The Schwarzschild\nradius is treated as an absorbing boundary, i.e. particles that cross\nthe boundary are removed from the simulation. Their mass and lin-\near momentum are added to the hole in a way that the total centre\nof mass is conserved. The microphysics of the neutron star fluid is\ndescribed using a temperature and composition dependent nuclear\nEOS, based on relativistic mean field theory (Shen et al. 1998a,b;\nRosswog & Davies 2002). Local neutrino cooling and compositional\nchanges of the neutron star matter owing to weak interactions are ac-\ncounted for by a detailed, multiflavour neutrino scheme (Rosswog &\nLiebendo\u00a8rfer 2003). Details concerning the neutrino emission will\nbe presented elsewhere.\nWe use Newtonian self-gravity for the fluid which we evaluate via\na binary tree. The black hole is treated as a Newtonian point mass,\nresults for pseudo-potentials mimicking relativistic effects will be\npresented in a forthcoming paper. For the back reaction on to the\nfluid flow resulting from the emission of GWs we use the formalism\nof Zhuge, Centrella & McMillan (1996), applying the forces only\nto SPH particles that have a mass density in excess of a threshold\n(1014 g cm\u22123), which is above the phase transition density to neutron\nstar matter. This procedure is well justified, as in all but one of\nour simulations a neutron star core survives which is, to a good\napproximation, spherically symmetric. In the case of a complete\ndisruption no back-reaction force is applied by construction. This\nis also well justified, as the matter distribution for this case is very\nclose to axisymmetry.\n3.2 Initial conditions\nIt is a vital ingredient for these calculations to start out from initial\nconditions that are as accurate as possible as the whole dynamical\nevolution is sensitive to the starting configuration.\nAs the neutron star viscosity is too low to lead to a tidal locking\nof the system during the short interaction time, this spin configura-\ntion is not a realistic one (Bildsten & Cutler 1992). It is, however,\nstraightforward to construct such corotating equilibrium initial con-\nfigurations, a fact that makes these conditions appealing. We use\nthe full 3D code to construct the initial particle distributions.

The addition of the Coriolis force during the relax-\nation process would only introduce an additional lateral oscillation\nand therefore increase the computing time to find the equilibrium\nstate.\n(v) Finally, we apply an additional velocity proportional friction\nterm to force the system into the corotating state, i.e.\nf i = f g,i + f h,i \u2212 \u03c9 \u00d7 (\u03c9 \u00d7 r i ) \u2212\nvi\n\u03c4\n, (16)\nwhere \u03c4 is a damping time-scale.\n(vi) Once equilibrium is achieved, the velocities are transformed\nback to the space fixed system and the radial velocities are added.\nAn example of such a relaxation process for a 1.4-M\u0003 neutron\nstar and a 2.8-M\u0003 black hole is shown in Fig. 3. In the first 10 ms the\nsystem is relaxed in the corotating frame. Then it is set to an orbit\nwithout radial velocities and no back-reaction forces are applied.\nSubsequently it is evolved for more than one orbital revolution with\nthe full hydro code. The system remains in perfect equilibrium: no\noscillation in the densities of the centre and the surface can be seen,\nafter one orbit practically each particle lies right on top of its initial\nposition.\nFor the case without initial neutron star spin we use a 1.4 M\u0003\nneutron star that has been relaxed to equilibrium in isolation. This\nstar is set (with the appropriate radial velocity) on an orbit with\nan angular frequency determined from the force balance condition\n(equation 14).\n4 R E S U LT S\nWe performed six production runs with up to 106 SPH particles,\nexploring the dependence of the results on the mass ratio (q =\n0.1, 0.3, 0.5) and on the initial neutron star spin (corotation and no\ninitial spin). We follow the evolution for a long time (up to 64 ms\ncorresponding to 300 dynamical time-scales of the initial neutron\nstar; previous investigations (Lee & Kluzniak 1999a,b; Janka et al.\n1999; Lee 2000, 2001) typically simulated \u223c20 ms). Details of the\nruns are shown in Table 1.\nAfter an inspiral of typically one orbit, mass transfer sets in. In\nthe corotating case, the mass from the neutron star is initially fed\ndirectly into the hole with mass transfer rates of several hundred\nM\u0003 per second; see below. In agreement with the analytical esti-\nmates, the system without initial spin has less difficulties to bypass\nthe Schwarzschild radius. Although somewhat easier in the irrota-\ntional case, we find it generally hard to form a massive accretion\ndisc around the hole.\nThe dynamical evolution of run A (corotation, q = 0.1), run E (no\nspin, q = 0.3) and the extreme case run G (corotation, q = 0.93) are\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 351, 1121\u20131133\n by guest on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nNeutron star\u2013black hole binaries 1125\nTable 1.

For the smallest mass\nratio, q = 0.1, there is one extreme initial mass transfer phase (see\npanel 2 in Fig. 4), in which around 1 M\u0003 is transferred within 5 ms\ninto the hole, corresponding to a peak rate of more than 500 M\u0003\ns\u22121. After this phase the system undergoes six more mass transfer\nepisodes in which the individual peak rates reach \u223c0.8 M\u0003 s\u22121; the\nhole mass increases only insignificantly during this phase. The larger\nmass ratio cases exhibit a shorter initial mass transfer, however,\nsubstantially more mass is accreted by the hole in the subsequent\nmass transfer episodes (see step-like behaviour in panel 2).\nThe mass transfer in the cases where the neutron star has no\ninitial spin (see Fig. 8) is also dominated by the initial mass transfer\nepisode with huge rates, again up to 500 M\u0003 s\u22121. The rates in the\nsubsequent phases, however, are typically two orders of magnitude\nlower so that the hole mass increases only marginally.\n4.2 Disc\nAn accretion disc around a black hole is a vital ingredient for virtu-\nally all GRB models. Usually it is assumed that a neutron star\u2013black\nhole merger is just a variant of neutron star binary mergers and\nproduces even more massive (several 0.1 M\u0003), hot discs around\nthe hole. We will show here that this assumption is \u2013 at least for\nour (hard) EOS and the simulate time-scale of several 10 ms \u2013 not\njustified.\nFig. 9 shows the SPH-particle densities in the inner region of\nrun A (compare to the last panel in Fig. 4). The innermost part\nof the disc reaches densities of up to 1011 g cm\u22123 and contains\na mass of only 7 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u0003. The disc out to 600 km (red area\nin panel six of Fig. 4) contains 3 \u00d7 10\u22122 M\u0003. The interaction of\nthe accretion stream with the disc is shown in Fig. 10. The mass-\nweighted temperatures of these disc regions are 2.5 and 1.4 MeV,\nrespectively. This configuration is not very promising to launch a\nGRB, it can only anchor moderate magnetic fields and the neutrino\nemission is considerably lower than in the double neutron star case\nwhich can only produce GRBs of relatively low total energy output.\nThe other two corotating runs do not form any resolvable disc at\nall. The matter from the neutron star is transferred directly into the\nhole. From its backside mass is tidally removed. However, rather\nthan forming a massive tidal tail like in the case of run A, this\ndecompressed neutron star material forms a low-density common\nenvelope around the orbiting neutron star\u2013black hole system.\nThe case of q = 0.3 and no spin (run E) is shown in Fig. 5. Here\nthe rest of the neutron star is orbiting inside a disc that is continually\ndecreasing in density from values of 1010 g cm\u22123 between the hole\nand the neutron star to values of \u223c105 g cm\u22123 at a distance of\n400 km from the hole. All the disc masses are very low, a few times\n10\u22123 M\u0003, as still a lot of the total mass is retained in the orbiting\nmini neutron star. The (mass averaged) temperatures in these inner\ndiscs are only moderate, typically 3 MeV. Further details can be\nfound in Table 2. Thus, none of the performed runs yields accretion\ndisc that would be a convincing candidate to launch a GRB.\n4.3 Neutron star evolution\nThe mass flow into the hole induces a sometimes violent fluid mo-\ntion within the neutron star. To illustrate the difference for both spin\ncases, we plot the velocities in a frame that is momentarily rotating\non a circular orbit (both the neutron star and black hole are lying on\nthe x-axis) with the neutron star being at the origin. In this frame\na perfectly corotating binary should only exhibit a radial velocity\nalong the x-axis. We show in Fig. 11 two cases (corotating and no\nspin) where mass transfer has just set in. Note that the matter trans-\nferred towards the hole is coming from the neutron star backside.\nWhile the fluid figure of the corotating case is rather symmetric\nwith respect to the x-axis, the irrotational case exhibits substantial\nperturbations on the front side of the neutron star.\nThe mass transfer induces high-amplitude (with respect to the\nneutron star radius) surface waves travelling with the sense of the\norbital motion. They whip through the accretion stream connecting\nthe neutron star with the hole, sometimes quenching the accretion\nstream. An example of such a phase is shown in Fig. 12 (same\ncoordinate system as Fig. 11).\nWe find that in almost all cases the core of the neutron star survives\nall the mass transfer phases and continues to orbit the hole as a \u2018mini\nneutron star\u2019. Only in our extreme (test) case with a black hole of\n1.5 M\u0003 (q = 0.93) the neutron star is completely disrupted to form\na hot and massive accretion disc.\n4.4 Gravitational waves\nIf the more optimistic estimates for the neutron star\u2013black hole\nmerger rates are correct, these systems may be among the first\nsources to be detected by ground-based GW detectors. As will be\nshown below, the GW signal bears a clear imprint of the high-density\nnuclear matter EOS.\nWe show in Figs 13 and 14 the GW signatures of a run where a\nmini neutron star survives (run A) and of a case where the neutron\nstar is finally completely disrupted. The first panel in each of the\nfigures shows the mutual separation between the neutron star (de-\nfined as the centre of mass of the material with densities in excess\nof 1014 g cm\u22123) and the black hole. After a smooth inspiral phase,\nthe mass transfer (directly) into the hole sets in, which increases the\norbital separation. The mini neutron star is then on a non-circular\norbit and is further driven back to the hole by the GW back reaction.\nThis sequence of mass transfer, moving out, coming back in, trans-\nferring mass to the hole again etc. continues until the end of the very\nlong simulation. The existence of the mini neutron star is reflected\nin the GW luminosity: each periastron approach corresponds to a\npeak in the GW luminosity.\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 351, 1121\u20131133\n by guest on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1126 S.

Same as in Fig. 7 but for the cases without neutron star spin\n(masses in solar units; offsets added to enhance visibility).\nIn our extreme case, run G, only three more close approaches\n(apart from the first one) are visible in the GW signal. The last\nencounter tidally disrupts the neutron star.\nThe survival of the neutron star is a direct consequence of the\nstiffness of the EOS. To prove this we have performed two low-\nresolution test runs with a soft (\u0004 = 2; run H) and a stiff (\u0004 = 3;\nrun I) polytropic EOS. In the case of the soft EOS the neutron star\nis completely disrupted (see Fig. 15) while in the case with the stiff\nEOS, a mini neutron star survives (see Fig. 16). Thus, the GW signal\nserves as a direct probe of the poorly known regime of supranuclear\ndensities.\n5 S U M M A RY A N D D I S C U S S I O N\nWe have performed simulations of the accretion dynamics in neu-\ntron star\u2013black hole systems. Our simulations used a 3D smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics code together with the relativistic mean field\nnuclear EOS of Shen et al. (1998a,b) and a detailed neutrino scheme.\nGravity was approximated with Newtonian forces plus back reaction\nfrom the emission of GWs.\nGenerally, we find a rather complex dynamics determined by\nthe interplay between mass transfer (trying to increase the orbital\nseparation), GW back reaction (acting to reduce the separation) and\nthe reaction of the neutron star to mass loss. This reaction includes\nboth the change of the neutron star radius and (in some cases) very\nviolent fluid motions inside the star with amplitudes comparable to\nthe stellar radius. In some of the cases the neutron star even seems to\nbe close to fissioning into two fragments. Thus, a certain fraction of\nsystems may result in a black hole orbited by two low-mass neutron\nstars. We find that many of the analytic estimates that are useful\nin other accreting systems are of limited use for neutron star\u2013black\nhole systems. The overall evolution is very sensitive to the neutron\nstar\u2013black hole mass ratio.\nWe show generally that \u2013 if not superimposed by other effects\nsuch as a different tidal deformation or a different tidal lag angle \u2013\nirrotational donor stars form easier accretion discs than corotating\nones. This result is not restricted to neutron star\u2013black hole systems,\nbut holds generally. The reason is that in the irrotational case mass\noverflowing the L1 Lagrange point has more specific angular mo-\nmentum and therefore a larger circularization radius. In the neutron\nstar\u2013black hole case more material can avoid being fed directly into\nthe Schwarzschild radius if the donor star is not spinning.\nIn the context of GRB progenitors neutron star\u2013black hole sys-\ntems are usually regarded only as a slight modification of the binary\nneutron star case. It is often stated that they will yield the \u2018standard\nGRB central engine\u2019, a black hole with a hot and massive accretion\ndisc. Here, however, we find it very difficult to form such a disc.\nAlthough somewhat easier in the irrotational case, we find for all\nbut extreme cases rather low-temperature discs (\u223c3 MeV) of mod-\nerate densities, which are not promising to either launch a GRB via\nneutrino annihilation or via energy extraction from the black hole\nrotation with suitable magnetic field configurations. Some of our\ninvestigated systems do not form any resolvable discs at all. At the\nend of the simulation we have in these cases a binary system of a\nblack hole and a low-mass neutron star engulfed in a common en-\nvelope of low-density material that has been tidally removed from\nthe neutron star.\nWe find in all but extreme cases that the core of the initial star\nsurvives all mass transfer episodes as a \u2018mini neutron star\u2019. Test\nruns with polytropic EOSs (\u0004 = 2 and \u0004 = 3) show that in the\ncase of a stiff EOS a mini neutron star forms while a soft EOS\nleads to a complete tidal disruption of the neutron star. This result is\nconsistent with the work of Lee (2000, 2001) and Lee & Kluzniak\n(1999a,b). Janka et al. (1999) also find in some cases that the core\nof the neutron star survives the initial mass transfer episodes but\nlater on is completely disrupted. This is consistent with their EOS\nbeing somewhat softer than the one we use (for a comparison of\nboth EOSs see fig. 5 of Rosswog & Davies 2002).\nThe survival of a mini neutron star and the difficulty to form a mas-\nsive accretion disc are not unrelated; the surviving stellar core acts\nas some kind of storage that prevents mass from flowing towards\nthe hole. Both effects are a result of the stiffness of the neutron\nstar EOS as can be seen from an inspection of the test runs with a\nstiff (neutron star core, low-mass disc) and a soft polytropic EOS\n(complete disruption, more massive disc). Janka et al. (1999) found\nvalues for the neutrino emission and annihilation that are rather op-\ntimistic for GRBs. In both sets of simulations different numerical\nmethods are used, but we regard the differences resulting from dif-\nferent techniques as minor. We consider the uncertainty in the basic\nphysics at supranuclear densities and the sensitivity of the system\ndynamics to this part of the EOS to be the decisive factors for the\ndifferences in the results. There are not many equations of state\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 351, 1121\u20131133\n by guest on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1130 S.

GW emission of run A (q = 0.1, corotating neutron star). The upper panel shows the separation of the neutron star (defined via a density threshold\nof 1014 g cm\u22123) and the black hole. Panels 2 and 3 show the gravitational amplitudes h+ and hx (d is the distance to the observer) and the last panel gives the\nGW luminosity. In this run the mini neutron star survives the whole simulated time, the periastron approaches are clearly visible in the GW luminosity.\n0 10 20 30 40\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nd  \n14\n0 10 20 30 40\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\nd \nh  \n+\n0 10 20 30 40\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\nd \nh  \nx\n0 10 20 30 40\nt [ms]\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\nlo\ng(\nL\n G\nW\n)\nFigure 14.

(A1)\nThe second time-derivatives, \u00a8I jk , can be expressed in terms of parti-\ncle properties by straight forward differentiation. For the third-order\ntime-derivatives we use the analytical derivatives of a cubic spline\ninterpolation of the \u00a8I jk .
