INTRODUCTION \n \nLead scandium tantalate (PST) is a very promising candidate for the \napplication of uncooled thermal imaging because of its high figure of \nmerit for infrared detection [1]. Recent effort has been focused on the \ngrowth of PST as thin films directly onto silicon wafers in order to \nlower cost and improve device performance [2]. \n \nThe magnetron sputtering technique has been widely employed for the \ndeposition of ferroelectric thin films. It is a dry technique compatible \nwith IC-technology but is capital intensive and the film composition is \ndifficult to modify. The metal-organic liquid delivery chemical vapour \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nZ. HUANG, P.P DONOHUE, Q.ZHANG et al. \ndeposition (LDCVD) technique has a higher deposition rate and more \nflexible control of composition than the sputtering method. It also has \nvery good step coverage and capable of coating onto large-area \nsubstrates. However, it is also capital intensive, and it is sometimes  \ndifficult to obtain appropriate precursors. On the other hand, sol-gel is \nrelatively low cost to set up and simple to apply, confers easily control \nof composition, but being a wet chemical process with poor step-\ncoverage properties is perhaps less acceptable in a semiconductor \ndevice processing context.  In this communication we will report the \ndeposition of PST films by using different techniques such as \nsputtering, LDCVD, and sol-gel. Their respective microstructures and \nelectrical properties before and after the post-deposition anneal will be \npresented. \n \n \n2. EXPERIMENTAL  \n \nLDCVD was carried out using Pt\/Ti\/SiO2\/Si substrates. Heptane was \nused as the solvent and nitrogen as the carrier gas. The vaporiser and \nsubstrate temperatures were 200 \u00b0C and 600 \u00b0C respectively. In order to \nencourage nucleation of the perovskite phase, a thin seed layer of \nPbTiO3 was initially deposited onto the Pt surface. For more details see \nreference [3]. \n  \nSputtering deposition was carried out in a custom sputtering system \nwhich uses dual RF magnetron sputtering targets in an argon\/10% \noxygen atmosphere. More details have been published elsewhere [4, 5].  \nFilms were deposited at 300 \u00b0C \n \nFor sol-gel deposition, precursors were first prepared. Pb(OAc)2.3H2O \nwas mixed with IPA with the ratio of Pb(OAc)2.3H2O : IPA  1g:1ml. \nTa(OEt)5 and Sc(OAc)3 was mixed in IPA with the ratio of Ta(OEt)5 : \nIPA 1g: 60ml. A lead zirconate titanate (PZT) layer was first coated on a \nPt\/Ti\/SiO2\/Si substrate as a seeding layer in an attempt to reduce PST \ncrystallisation temperature. PST layers were spun onto the top of PZT. \nEach coating went through drying (200 \u00b0C, 30 s) and annealing (580 \u00b0C, \n10 min.) procedures. 1% Mn was doped into both the PZT and PST \nlayers to improve  film electrical properties. For more details see \nreference [3]. \n \nRapid thermal annealing (RTA) of the samples was carried out using an \nAG Associates Minipulse Rapid Thermal Processor system with a \nheating ramp rate of 50 \u00b0C\/s and natural cooling.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCOMPARATIVE STUDY OF PST FILMS \n \nWhere possible electrical characterisation has been carried out on both \nas-deposited and annealed films. Top electrode of Au(100 nm)\/Cr(10 \nnm) was deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask. A \nComponent Analyser was used to measure pyroelectric and dielectric \nproperties (permittivity \u03b50\u03b5r ,  dielectric loss tan\u03b4) at 35 \u00b0C and 50 \u00b0C \nand in addition permittivity and  dielectric loss were measured as \nfunctions of temperature \u2013 all in an inert atmosphere of 300 mbar N2.  \n \n \n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nFigure 1a shows the XRD patterns for the as-deposited sol-gel and \nLDCVD films. The intensity is in logarithm scale. The spectrum for the \nLDCVD film is moved up by one unit to improve visibility. Both films \nwere mainly perovskite (Pe), with the sol-gel film mainly (222) oriented \nand the LDCVD film a mixed orientation. There is a recognizable peak \nof pyrochlore (Py) phase in the LDCVD film but hardly any in the sol-\ngel film. The as-deposited sputtering films were pyrochlore and \namorphous. \n \nIt is a surprise to observe the B-site ordering Pe(111) peak at 2\u03b8 < 20\u00b0 \nfor the as-deposited sol-gel film. It is generally believed that B-site \nordering in PST starts at temperatures of 700 \u00b0C or higher. \n \nThe XRD patterns for the RTA treated films are shown in Figure 1b. \nPerovskite peaks grew stronger for all three films after RTA. For sol-gel \nfilm, the increase for normal perovskite peaks was moderate. However, \nthe ordering peak Pe(111) was more than doubled, from 136 to 324. \nExtra peaks were observed for the LDCVD film after the RTA. These \npeaks could be indexed as PbTiO3, and were labeled PT in figure 1b. \nThis is not surprising since a seeding layer of PbTiO3 was deposited  \nprior to the deposition of the PST layer. No sign of ordering was \nobserved even after RTA annealing at 850 \u00b0C for 120 s for the LDCVD \nfilms. The sputtered film after RTA treatment was strongly (222) \noriented perovskite, with other orientations like (200) and (220) 100 \ntimes less in intensity. Ordering was also observed for this film. \n \nThe cross-section transmission electron microscope (TEM) images for \nthe RTA annealed films are shown in figure 2 for (a) sol-gel; (b) \nLDCVD and (c) sputtered films respectively. The sol-gel prepared films \nhad a very smooth surface. The PZT seeding layer was about 60 nm \nthick. Each layer of the following PST was about 41 nm thick. The PST \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nZ. HUANG, P.P DONOHUE, Q.ZHANG et al. \nwas well columnar structured. There were voids in the PST, with bigger \nones concentrated at the PST grain boundaries. Occasionally, very large \nvoids or small areas of pyrochlore (as marked by arrow-heads) were \nobserved. There was no sign of materials diffusion during the deposition \nor the RTA annealing. Chemical analysis by scanning electron \nmicroscope showed that the composition was Sc:Ta:Pb = 1:0.9:2.47, \n \n \nFigure 1  XRD patterns for the (a) as-deposited and (b) RTA annealed \nPST thin films as prepared by different techniques. \n \n \nindicating a high level of excess lead. Unlike the sol-gel film, the \nLDCVD film surface was rough, with peak to trough about a third of the \nfilm thickness. The film appeared to be fully perovskite and had good \ncrystallinity with grain size  of about 0.5 \u03bcm. For the sputtered film, \nthere were many voids in the PST and the film surface was relatively \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 5 0\n2  T h e t a\nLo\ng.\n In\nte\nns\nity\nL D C V D\nS o l - g e l\nP e ( 1 1 1 )\nP e ( 2 0 0 )\nP t\nP e ( 2 2 2 )\nP e ( 4 0 0 )\nP e ( 2 2 0 )\nP t\nP y ( 2 2 2 )\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 5 0\n2  T h e t a\nLo\ng.\n In\nte\nns\nity\n \nP e ( 1 1 1 )\nP t\nP e ( 2 2 2 )\nP e ( 2 2 0 )\nL D C V D\nS p u t t e r e d\nS o l - G e l\nP e ( 4 0 0 )\nP e ( 2 0 0 )\nP tS i\nP T\nP T\na \nb \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCOMPARATIVE STUDY OF PST FILMS \nsmooth.

For sol-gel films, RTA annealing in O2 resulted in blistering  to \nthe extend that no electrical measurements were carried out for the RTA \ntreated films. The sputtering as-deposited films contained no perovskite \nphase and no electrical measurement was attempted.  \n \nThe relative permittivity \u03b5r and dielectric loss tan\u03b4 at 50 \u00b0C as  functions \nof applied field at 120Hz for the as deposited sol-gel,  RTA annealed \nLDCVD and sputtered films are shown in figure 3. The as-deposited sol-\ngel film showed very low permittivity \u03b5r and high dielectric loss tan\u03b4.  \nFor the LDCVD and sputtered films, as is expected for a relaxor like \nPST, relative permittivity \u03b5r and dielectric loss tan\u03b4 decrease with \nincreasing applied field. However, for sol-gel films, the decrease was \nmuch more moderate and there was no significant frequency \ndependence of the \u03b5r and tan\u03b4. \n \nFigure 3   The relative permittivity \u03b5r and dielectric loss tan\u03b4 as \n                 Functions of dc bias at 120Hz for the PST films. \n \n \nThe pyroelectric coefficient p and materials merit figure Fd (50 \u00b0C, \n120Hz) at temperature of 50 \u00b0C for the above films are shown in figure \n4. For the as-deposited sol-gel films, a reasonable maximum \npyroelectric coefficient of 269 \u03bcCm-2K-1, and a merit figure Fd  of \n1.0\u00d710-5 Pa-1\/2 was achieved at an applied field of  10.7 V\/\u03bcm. Unusualy \nfor PST thin films the zero field pyroelectric coefficient was small and \nindeed there was evidence for a small internal bias field antiparallel to \nthe applied field (top electrode positive).

Upon further increase of the field, the pyroelectric \ncoefficient showed little change.

The \nLDCVD and sputtered films behaved like a relaxor, namely, \u03b5r peaked \njust under 20 \u00b0C  and loss tan\u03b4 peaked at a temperature below 20 \u00b0C. \nHowever, for the sol-gel film, there was little temperature dependence of  \n\u03b5r and the dielectric loss increased with increasing temperature until the \nhighest temperature 80 \u00b0C. In this sense, the as-deposited sol-gel film \ndid not behave like a relaxor. This was probably due to a dc leakage for \nthis film. \n \n \n \nFigure 4 The pyroelectric coefficient p and merit figure Fd as functions \n               of dc bias at 120Hz for the PST films. \n \n \n \n \n \n-1 0 0\n0\n1 0 0\n2 0 0\n3 0 0\n4 0 0\n5 0 0\n6 0 0\n7 0 0\n8 0 0\n0 2 4 6 8 1 0 1 2 1 4\nB ia s  (V \/\u03bc m )\nPy\nro\n.

Nevertheless  it is a surprise to observe that the as-\ndeposited LDCVD films had very low breakdown strength and low \nresistivity whilst post-annealed LDCVD films showed good electrical \nproperties,  although both XRD and TEM did not reveal significant \nstructural changes. The surface roughness is unlikely to be responsible \nfor the low breakdown field since this is the same before and after the \nRTP annealing. There must be something else which had be changed \ndramatically during the RTA annealing but cannot be revealed either by \nXRD or TEM techniques. Such effects including oxygen vacancy,  \nexcess Pb level, interface effect,  etc. Further study in this direction is in \nprogress.  \n \nThe surface roughness of the LDCVD films could be improved if these \nfilms were subjected to further sol-gel coating. \n \n \n3. CONCLUSIONS \n \nLead scandium tantalate thin films for pyroelectric applications have \nbeen deposited by using liquid delivery chemical vaporise deposition, \nsputtering and sol-gel techniques. These films were rapid thermal \nannealed to improve their electrical properties. Their microstructure was \ninvestigated by using x-ray diffraction and transmission electron \nmicroscopy and their electrical properties such as permittivity \u03b5r, \ndielectric loss tan\u03b4, pryoelectric coefficient p, and thermal detection \nfigure of merit Fd were measured. A comparison of  microstructure and \nelectrical property between different films suggest  that there is no \nsimple relationship between the microstructure and its electrical \nproperties. Sol-gel and LDCVD produce very \u2018good looking\u2019 as-\ndeposited PST films in terms of XRD spectra and TEM micrograph but \nthese films show poor dielectric loss and figure of merit. On the other \nhand, the sputtered and then RTP annealed films had lots of voids but \ngave rather good electrical properties. It is suggested that the best \nstrategy to prepare high quality PST thin films should be to use a \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCOMPARATIVE STUDY OF PST FILMS \ncombination of  methods to deposit the films and then apply the RTA \ntechnique.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis work was funded by the UK Ministry of Defence.
