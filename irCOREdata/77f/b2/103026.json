INTRODUCTION\nThree-dimensional confinement of charge carriers in\nquantum dots makes these nanostructures extremely attrac-\ntive for use in photonic devices and for quantum computing\napplications.1 Of particular interest are self-assembled quan-\ntum dots which are free of defects and are therefore efficient\noptical emitters.2,3 It is now clear that a wide variety of dif-\nferent dot structures can be self-assembled by subtle changes\nin the growth conditions. For instance, InAs quantum dots on\nGaAs grown at low temperatures are small and have a pyra-\nmidal character4 whereas InAs quantum dots grown at higher\ntemperatures are larger with a lenslike shape.5 The detailed\nshape and composition profile of the dots has important con-\nsequences for the optical properties. This has been demon-\nstrated recently for InGaAs dots where an indium concentra-\ntion profile, from indium poor at the base to indium rich at\nthe apex,6 causes the center of gravity of the hole wave func-\ntion to lie above that of the electron, giving a net negative\npermanent dipole moment along the growth direction.7\nA notable development in the self-assembly of semicon-\nductor nanostructures has been the growth of quantum rings.8\nThe rings are formed from large InAs quantum dots by par-\ntially covering the quantum dots with GaAs to destabilize\nthem. During an annealing step at the growth temperature, a\nremarkable change in topology occurs, such that the original\ndots acquire a hole in their center and take on a ringlike\nshape. The ring formation is presently not understood in de-\ntail, but it has been suggested that it arises through a dewet-\nting process.9,10 The rings have quite different electronic\nproperties compared to the original dots,11\u201316 including in0163-1829\/2004\/69~3!\/035327~9!\/$22.50 69 0353particular a large and positive permanent dipole moment,\nwith the electron center of gravity about 1 nm above the hole\ncenter of gravity.15\nThe discovery of the self-assembly of quantum rings has\ninitiated a number of theoretical studies into their properties.\nThe significant differences from lithographically defined\nrings are that the ring confines both electron and hole,14 not\njust the electron, and that it is possible to load a self-\nassembled ring with a small number of electrons starting\nfrom zero occupancy.11 A perfect ring exhibits quantum in-\nterference effects in a magnetic field, resulting in Aharanov-\nBohm-like oscillations in the magnetization as a function of\napplied magnetic field.17,18 There is evidence in self-\nassembled rings for the first Aharanov-Bohm oscillation\nfrom vertical tunneling experiments.11 The possibility of an\nAharanov-Bohm effect for an exciton has been considered.\nAn exciton is a neutral particle and so at first sight no phase-\nrelated effects are expected. However, the exciton is a com-\nposite particle, and this allows for the possibility of weak\nphase-related effects.19,20 For a one-dimensional ring, both\nthe exciton energy and oscillator strength oscillate with mag-\nnetic field, although the effect is exponentially small.19,20 The\nwidth of self-assembled rings is a significant fraction of their\nradius and so this needs to be taken into account. For finite\nwidth rings, the general consensus from theoretical investi-\ngations is that the Aharanov-Bohm effects in the ground-state\nexciton disappear,21\u201323 but there are flux-related oscillations\nin the energies of the excited states.22,23 The result on the\nground state has been recently confirmed by photolumines-\ncence experiments on rings defined by etching a ring shape\nin a semiconductor quantum well.24 In these experiments,\u00a92004 The American Physical Society27-1\nJ. A. BARKER, R. J. WARBURTON, AND E. P. O\u2019REILLY PHYSICAL REVIEW B 69, 035327 ~2004!there is no evidence for an Aharanov-Bohm effect in the\nneutral exciton, but the charged exciton displays a flux-\nrelated effect largely through the pronounced Aharanov-\nBohm effect of the electron left behind after recombination.24\nModels have been developed to account for various factors\nin semiconductor quantum rings, for instance the\neccentricity,25 the effective mass discontinuity in the conduc-\ntion band,26 and the valence band structure,27 and also the\nbehavior in a lateral electric field which can enhance the\nAharanov-Bohm effect by delocalizing the electron and\nhole.28 However, all these models, and also those developed\nfor mesoscopic systems,18 assume that the lateral potential\ndepends only on the radial coordinate and not on the azimuth\nangle. We point out here that for self-assembled quantum\nrings, this assumption is no longer valid. The piezoelectric\nfield reduces the symmetry such that the potential depends\non the azimuth angle, and for realistic parameters we find\nthat this can lead to significant localization of the wave func-\ntions, particularly for the hole.\nIn the present paper, we present calculations of the elec-\ntron and hole wave functions in self-assembled semiconduc-\ntor quantum rings, considering a variety of different ring\nshapes and composition profiles. We use a carefully chosen\none-band effective mass Hamiltonian to investigate the elec-\ntron and hole ground-state wave functions, demonstrating\nhow the symmetry of the wave functions follows the piezo-\nelectric potential distribution and strain fields of the inclu-\nsion. To elucidate some of the key points and to allow a\ncomparison with facetted quantum dots, we consider initially\nboth circular and square lateral profiles, both with a rectan-\ngular, reflection-symmetric vertical profile. We consider how\nthe wave functions are modified if we break the reflection\nsymmetry of the ring in the vertical direction by introducing\nan indium concentration gradient, and for a circular lateral\nprofile, we investigate the effect of breaking the cylindrical\nsymmetry by elongating the ring along the @11\u00af0# direction.\nThese results show that the piezoelectric field and the biaxial\nstrain distribution each play a crucial role in determining the\nfinal form of the electron and hole ground-state wave func-\ntions. We then go on from these model calculations to con-\nsider more realistic ring shapes. General trends for the\nground-state wave functions can be deduced, and these allow\nus to conclude that the spectroscopy results on self-\nassembled quantum rings are consistent with the directly\nmeasured shape and symmetry of uncapped rings.\nII. METHOD\nFollowing Ref. 29, we solve Schro\u00a8dinger\u2019s equation for a\nsystem of semiconductor nanostructures using a plane-wave\nenvelope function Hamiltonian. Assuming a three-\ndimensional superlattice of rings with a unit cell size of\n2Lx32Ly32Lz , the energy eigenvalues En for the system\nare given by\n(\nk\nH\u00af k,k8Ak\nn5En(\nk\nAk\nn\n, ~1!03532where Ak\nn is the coefficient for the plane wave of the nth\neigenvalue whose wave vector k5(kx ,ky ,kz)\n5p(a\/Lx ,b\/Ly ,c\/Lz). a, b, and c take integer values. The\nmatrix H\u00af k,k8 is the Fourier transform of the Hamiltonian\nH\u02c6 (r), given by\nH\u00af k,k85E d3r8LxLyLz exp~2ik8\u0095r!H\u02c6 ~r!exp~ ik\u0095r!, ~2!\nwith r5(x ,y ,z). Use of a plane-wave basis set allows us to\nfind analytic expressions for complex potential distributions\nsuch as the strain and piezoelectric distributions for the nano-\nstructure shapes of interest.30 For example, the Fourier trans-\nform \u00ab\u02dc i j of the strain tensor components \u00ab i j is given by\n(k9\u00de0)\n\u00ab\u02dc i j5x\u02dc ~k9!\u00ab0F d i j2S C1112C12C11 D ki9k j9uk9u2G , ~3!\nwhere k95k2k8, x\u02dc (k9) is the Fourier transform of the ring\ncharacteristic function, C11 and C12 are the elastic constants\nfor the material, and \u00ab0 is the lattice mismatch of the ring\nand barrier materials ~6.7% for InAs in GaAs!. An extension\nof the analysis of Ref. 30 to the piezoelectric potential dpz\ngives the Fourier transform d\u02dc pz in terms of the piezoelectric\nconstant e14 .

The re-\npeat distances 2Lx , 2Ly , and 2Lz are chosen to be large\nenough that there is a negligible interaction between one ring\nand its neighbor.\nWe take the band gaps and effective masses for GaAs\n~InAs! to be 1.519 ~0.42! eV and 0.067 ~0.023!, respectively.\nThe conduction-~valence-! band edges between unstrained\nInAs and unstrained GaAs are offset by 0.834 eV ~0.265 eV!.\nFor the InxGa12xAs alloy, we assume that the energy gap,\nthe band offsets and the inverse effective masses vary lin-\nearly with x. All other parameters are listed in Ref. 29. We\nhave shown previously, using the example of a pyramidal dot\nshape, that this method gives good agreement with the elec-\ntron and heavy hole ground-state energies calculated with a\nmore accurate eight-band k\u0095P model.29 This result is ex-\npected for the electron; for the heavy hole, it arises because\nthe heavy hole is largely decoupled from the other valence\nstates because of quantum confinement and the large biaxial\nstrain. We can therefore use the method with confidence to\ncalculate the electron and heavy-hole ground states in quan-\ntum rings. We concentrate here on the form of the wave\nfunctions for various ring shapes and composition profiles\nand for this our method is perfectly adequate. As we show,\nthe uncertainties in the exact shape and composition profiles\nof the rings introduce far more variations in the results than\nwould arise from different levels of sophistication in the\ntheory.7-2\nELECTRON AND HOLE WAVE FUNCTIONS IN SELF- . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW B 69, 035327 ~2004!III. GENERAL RESULTS FOR ELECTRON AND HOLE\nWAVE FUNCTIONS IN QUANTUM RINGS\nWe consider initially a ring with a circular lateral profile\nand cylindrical symmetry. The ring is assumed to be pure\nInAs, embedded in GaAs. Because of the large lattice mis-\nmatch between InAs and GaAs, the ring is highly strained.\nFigure 1 plots the biaxial strain @\u00abax5\u00abzz2(\u00abxx1\u00abyy)\/2#\ndistribution for two cylindrical rings, both with outer diam-\neter 60 nm and inner diameter 30 nm. One ring has vertical\nthickness 15 nm ~top!, the other 2 nm ~bottom!. It can be\nseen that for the 15 nm thick ring, the biaxial strain is nega-\ntive ~as defined here! in the regions immediately above and\nbelow the ring, taking large positive values in the GaAs bar-\nrier material at the ring center. The biaxial strain is more\nconcentrated inside the ring for the 2 nm thick ring, but also\nhere there is some biaxial strain in the core region.\nThe large strain in the quantum rings generates a piezo-\nelectric field. Figure 2 contains contour plots of the piezo-\nelectric potential on the ~110! plane for two rings with square\nlateral profiles. We take a square lateral profile in order to\nfacilitate an immediate comparison with the results for a cu-\nbic dot for which there are eight piezoelectric extrema, one\nclose to each corner @see Fig. 1~b! of Ref. 31#. The most\nstriking feature of Fig. 2~a! is that, in addition to the set of\neight piezoelectric extrema near to the eight outer corners of\nthe ring, there is a second set of potential minima and\nmaxima at the inner edges. These additional piezoelectric\nextrema arise from the presence of the GaAs core. We note\nthat a cylindrical ring, as in Fig. 1, has qualitatively the same\nFIG. 1. Biaxial strain distribution as a function of position on\nthe ~010! plane through the ring center for a disclike InAs\/GaAs\nquantum ring of outer diameter 60 nm, inner diameter 30 nm, and\nheight 15 nm ~top! and for a similar ring of height 2 nm ~bottom!.\nThe gray scales indicate the strain value ~in dimensionless units!.03532distribution of piezoelectric potential as the rings in Fig. 2.\nThe reason for this is that the piezoelectric potential depends\non the lateral crystal direction such that, even for a ring with\na shape invariant to an arbitrary rotation, the piezoelectric\nfield introduces a two-fold symmetry to the potential.\nFor dots, the piezoelectric potential extrema lie well out-\nside the dots, whereas the electron and hole wave functions\nare quite strongly localized inside the dots, such that the\npiezoelectric potential has a negligible effect on the electron\nand hole ground-state wave functions.29,31,32 Conversely, for\nthe quantum ring of Fig. 2~a!, the overlap of the electron and\nhole wave functions with the central piezoelectric potential is\nsignificantly larger than the overlap with the outer piezoelec-\ntric potential, so that we can expect a more pronounced pi-\nezoelectric deformation of the wave functions for a ring than\nfor a dot of similar dimensions. In fact, since the piezoelec-\ntric potentials are large for a ring with these dimensions, with\npeak values of 60.4 V, the position and shape of the\nground-state electron and hole wave functions are heavily\ninfluenced by the piezoelectric potential for this structure.\nFigure 2~b! plots the piezoelectric potential for a ring with\nthe same lateral dimensions as the ring in Fig. 2~a!, but with\na height reduced to 2 nm. The smaller volume of this ring\nreduces the magnitude of the piezoelectric extrema to less\nFIG. 2.

O\u2019REILLY PHYSICAL REVIEW B 69, 035327 ~2004!than 0.1 V in this case. We also note that the high aspect ratio\nof this ring deforms the piezoelectric potential, pushing the\nextrema out from the corners of the ring, which reduces the\noverlap between the piezoelectric potential and the ground-\nstate electron and hole wave functions. The piezoelectric-\ninduced deformations of the ground-state wave functions are\nconsiderably less for the ring in Fig. 2~b! than for the ring in\nFig. 2~a!, but nevertheless the piezoelectric potential still has\na significant influence.\nIn addition to the piezoelectric term in the Hamiltonian,\nthe heavy-hole wave functions are influenced by the biaxial\nstrain distribution. In particular, the negative biaxial strain in\nthe ring core lowers the potential barrier for the heavy holes\nallowing the heavy-hole wave function to spread inwards.\nThis increases the effective volume seen by the holes and\nshifts the ground-state heavy-hole energy level away from\nthe GaAs band edge. The mean lateral radius\nAu^chux\u02c6 21y\u02c6 2uch&u of the ground-state hole wave function\nch is therefore decreased. The electron wave function, ce , is\ninfluenced only by the hydrostatic strain and not by the bi-\naxial strain, so that this attraction into the central core is\nabsent for the electrons. Consequently, the electron radius\nAu^ceux\u02c6 21y\u02c6 2uce&u is larger than the hole radius for this par-\nticular form of quantum ring. However, for the 2 nm thick\nring, the biaxial strain fields do not extend particularly far\ninto the central core of the ring for this shape. We can there-\nfore anticipate that for the real self-assembled quantum rings,\nwhich have a small vertical extent and a high aspect ratio,\nthe biaxial strain is a relatively unimportant mechanism for\nintroducing a lateral separation of the electron and hole wave\nfunctions. Nevertheless, as we show by considering a variety\nof ring shapes in the following section, the biaxial strain can\nplay a significant role in introducing a vertical separation of\nthe electron and hole wave functions in rings which have a\nshape or composition asymmetry in the vertical ~growth! di-\nrection.\nWe now turn to the electron and hole wave functions in\nquantum rings, considering first the role of the piezoelectric\npotential in rings which are symmetric in the vertical direc-\ntion. Figures 3~a! and 3~b! are birds-eye views of the ground-\nstate electron and hole probability densities uce(h)u2 for an\nInAs\/GaAs quantum ring with cylindrical symmetry. The\nouter diameter is 60 nm, the inner diameter 30 nm, and the\nheight 2 nm. Both the ground-state electron wave function\nce and hole wave function ch are continuous around the\nring. Although the cylindrical symmetry of the inclusion re-\nsults in an electron-hole dipole d5u^chuz\u02c6 uch&u\n2u^ceuz\u02c6 uce&u equal to zero, the peak probability densities of\nthe ground state carriers in this ring are vertically separated\nby the piezoelectric potential on the ~110! and (11\u00af0) planes\nthrough the ring center, decreasing the wave function overlap\nu^ceuch&u, which takes a value of 0.854 for this ring, com-\npared with a value much closer to 1 for a quantum dot of\nsimilar dimensions. The piezoelectric-induced deepening of\nthe electron and hole potential energy wells also increases\nthe ground-state confinement energies measured relative to\nthe GaAs conduction and valence band edges, respectively,03532by several meV, with the greater shift in the heavy-hole\nground state.\nAt this point, we consider the effects of reducing the sym-\nmetry in the vertical direction. As an example, we introduce\na vertical composition gradient as has been discussed for\nquantum dots.7 This is not meant to be a realistic represen-\ntation of a real ring. Rather, we introduce the composition\ngradient in order to break the vertical symmetry while keep-\ning the ring volume the same. Figures 3~c! and 3~d! are\nbirds-eye views of the ground-state probability densities for\nan InxGa12xAs ring with the same geometry as for Figs. 3~a!\nand 3~b!, but with a composition varying linearly with z from\nx50 at the base to x51 at the top of the ring. In the absence\nof the piezoelectric field, the ground-state electron and hole\nwave functions would be uniform and continuous around the\nring. This is clearly not the case here, with the hole wave\nfunction localized in one particular plane @Fig. 3~d!#. This\narises because the piezoelectric potential introduces a\nu-dependent potential @u is the azimuth angle in the (x ,y)\nplane with the origin at the ring center#. In the particular case\nof Figs. 3~c! and 3~d!, the small ring volume results in a\nground-state electron wave function which is spread through-\nout the ring, whereas the large hole effective mass causes the\nhole wave function to shift towards the top of the ring be-\ncause of the indium concentration gradient. This not only\nintroduces a vertical electron-hole dipole moment, but it also\nincreases the overlap between the hole wave function and the\npiezoelectric potential minima on the (11\u00af0) plane towards\nthe inside of the ring, so that the hole wave function becomes\nlocalized. The important point is that the vertical asymmetry\nin the structure of the ring leads to a pronounced change in\nthe lateral symmetry in the carrier wave functions, particu-\nlarly for the hole.\nA further source of symmetry breaking is a possible de-\nparture from a perfectly circular shape in the (x ,y) plane.\nFigures 3~e! and 3~f! show the electron and hole ground-state\nprobability densities for an InAs quantum ring which has\nbeen stretched to an outer diameter of 72 nm on the ~110!\nplane and squeezed to an outer diameter of 48 nm on the\n(11\u00af0) plane. In this case, both electron and hole wave func-\ntions are localized by a combination of the piezoelectric po-\ntential and the ring shape itself, since there is a larger volume\nof ring material centered on the ~110! plane than on the\n(11\u00af0) plane. Even in the absence of any vertical asymmetry,\nthe lateral asymmetry introduces an electron-hole dipole mo-\nment in this case because the piezoelectric field tends to\nseparate the electron and hole, pulling the electron to the top\nof the elongated ring and the hole to the bottom.\nThe calculations so far have shown that the piezoelectric\npotential is important for quantum rings because it intro-\nduces a u-dependent potential. For all but the smallest quan-\ntum rings, this is sufficient to localize the heavy holes which\nhave a large effective mass along the @001# direction. In de-\ntail however, the structures considered so far cannot be ac-\ncurate representations of real quantum rings as they do not\nreproduce the physical properties. We therefore extend the\ncalculations to other shapes and composition profiles in order7-4\nELECTRON AND HOLE WAVE FUNCTIONS IN SELF- . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW B 69, 035327 ~2004!FIG. 3.

COMPARISON OF CALCULATED WAVE FUNCTIONS\nWITH EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON SELF-\nASSEMBLED QUANTUM RINGS\nWe consider all available experimental data on self-\nassembled quantum rings, namely, measurements of the to-\npography with atomic force micrography ~AFM!,12\ncapacitance-voltage spectroscopy for information on the\nelectron wave functions,11 and single quantum ring photolu-03532minescence in a vertical electric field as a measurement of\nthe typical electron-hole dipole moment.15 Figure 1 of Ref. 9\nand Fig. 1 of Ref. 12 show atomic force micrographs of\nself-assembled InxGa12xAs quantum rings where it is clear\nthat each nanostructure has a pronounced hole at its center.\nFigure 4 shows a cross-sectional height profile through the\ncenter of a typical quantum ring. It is striking that the hole in\nthe center extends to a deeper level than the material sur-\nrounding the quantum ring, a consequence of the expulsion\nof material during ring formation.12 The atomic force micro-\ngraphs are recorded on a surface ring, whereas the\ncapacitance-voltage and optical spectroscopy measurements7-5\nJ. A. BARKER, R. J. WARBURTON, AND E. P. O\u2019REILLY PHYSICAL REVIEW B 69, 035327 ~2004!are all carried out on buried rings. There is now strong evi-\ndence from cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy\nthat burying the rings with GaAs after their formation does\nnot destroy the ring shape.33 The reason for this is that the\nquantum rings are given sufficient time to form after which\nthe GaAs cap layer is deposited relatively quickly, not allow-\ning significant further changes in shape to occur. From the\npoint of view of calculating the wave functions, it is not a\npriori clear how the complicated shape in Fig. 4 can be best\ndescribed, particularly as the composition profile is un-\nknown. Also, it is clear in Fig. 4 that it is very misleading to\ndescribe the height as 2 nm, the approximate height between\nthe top of the ring and the background substrate level. The\nreal height is better described by 4 or 5 nm, the height be-\ntween the top of the ring and the crater in the center. We\nsuggest that the topology can be represented with the shape\nshown in Fig. 5, a quantum ring whose height decreases\nlinearly from a maximum value at the inner rim of the ring to\nzero at the outer radius. In all cases, we assume that the\nmaterial surrounding the ring, including that in the central\ncore, is pure GaAs. As the steep interfaces between the cen-\ntral core and the ring itself are very unlikely in real struc-\ntures, we have smeared the interfaces by including diffusion\nin the calculations with a diffusion length of 5 nm. We find\nthat the general form of the wave functions does not change\non smearing the interfaces, and the quantitative changes are\ninsignificant relative to the large changes we find in explor-\ning the parameter space. For simplicity therefore, we present\nthe results with the hard boundaries.\nFIG. 4. The cross section through the center of an uncapped\nself-assembled quantum ring taken with an atomic force micro-\nscope.\nFIG. 5. Quantum ring profile assumed in the calculations. The\nring has a height which decreases linearly from the inner rim to the\nouter edge. The ring is either pure InAs or a composition profile is\nintroduced with the indium concentration x decreasing linearly from\nx51 at the inner rim to x50 at the outer edge. The inner radius is\n15 nm, the height 4.5 nm, and the outer radius either 30 or 22.5 nm.03532For self-assembled quantum rings, capacitance spectros-\ncopy has been used to monitor changes in the ground-state\nenergy as a function of magnetic field, and a kink in the plot\nof charging voltage against magnetic field was observed\naround 8 T.11,12 These experiments probe what is expected to\nbe the most notable difference between the electronic struc-\nture of a quantum dot and a quantum ring. For an electron in\na quantum dot, the ground state maintains an s-like symme-\ntry at all magnetic fields. For a perfect quantum ring, this is\nno longer the case. When one flux quantum threads the cen-\ntral hole, the ground state becomes p-like, and further\nchanges to the ground-state angular momentum occur as ad-\nditional flux quanta penetrate the ring.17 The kink in the\ncharging voltage has been interpreted as the transition from\nan s-like to a p-like ground state because the magnetic field\nfor the transition is consistent with the size of the central\nhole. This experiment is therefore a strong indication that the\nelectron wave function in a typical self-assembled quantum\nring propagates around the ring, rather than being localized\nin just one part of the structure. While the hole may be lo-\ncalized in one part of the ring, we look therefore in our\nsimulations for electron wave functions that are delocalized.\nIn order to interpret cross-gap optical properties it is\nstrictly necessary to include in addition to the strain and\npiezoelectric field also the Coulomb interaction between the\nelectron and hole. However, in this work we are interested in\nthe general features such that we neglect the Coulomb inter-\naction. The justification for this is that the hole localization\nwe find in the theory is so strong that also the first excited\nhole state is localized in the same plane as the hole ground\nstate. The self-assembled quantum rings exhibit strong pho-\ntoluminescence with a typical recombination lifetime of just\nless than a nanosecond.34 We interpret this to mean that there\nis a strong overlap between the electron and hole wave func-\ntions and this is used to guide the simulations. Through\nsingle quantum ring experiments in a vertical electric field, it\nhas been found that excitons in self-assembled quantum\nrings possess permanent dipole moments, i.e., even with no\napplied bias, the average position of the electron and average\nposition of the hole are different.15 The dipole moments are\nboth opposite in sign and larger in magnitude than those of\nInAs quantum dots. For the rings, the mean position of the\nhole is experimentally determined to lie below the mean po-\nsition of the electron by typically 1 nm.\nThe calculated electron and hole wave functions pre-\nsented so far cannot be accurate representations of real quan-\ntum rings because the electron-hole dipole moments are ei-\nther zero @Figs. 3~a! and 3~b!#, or of the wrong sign @Figs.\n3~c! and 3~d!#, or far too small @Figs. 3~e! and 3~f!#. In fact,\nfor a variety of ring shapes and composition profiles, we find\nthat it is not possible to calculate a dipole moment as large as\n1 nm with a vertical ring height of just 2 nm, simply because\nthe boundaries of the quantum ring do not allow for large\nelectron and hole separations. This is a strong argument in\nfavor of a much larger ring height.\nThe first structure we present is a pure InAs quantum ring\nwith a circular lateral profile with outer diameter 60 nm,\ninner diameter 30 nm, and maximum height 4.5 nm, whose\nheight decreases linearly from a maximum value at the inner7-6\nELECTRON AND HOLE WAVE FUNCTIONS IN SELF- . . .

Figures 6~a! and\n6~b! are surface plots of the ground-state electron and hole\nprobability densities for this structure. Both the ground-state\nelectron and hole wave functions are localized predomi-\nnantly at the inside of the ring and towards the ring base, as\na consequence of the asymmetry in the ring shape. The pi-\nezoelectric potential then localizes the ground-state electron\nwave function on the (11\u00af0) plane through the ring-center\nand the ground-state heavy-hole wave function on the ~110!\nplane, as seen clearly in the figures. This structure cannot\nrepresent the real structure because the electron wave func-\ntion does not propagate around the ring and also because the\nelectron-hole overlap is far too small. However, the structure\ndoes help in understanding the origin of the electron-hole\ndipole moment. The magnitude of the biaxial strain varies\nwith height for the ring profile in Fig. 5, as was previously\nobserved for constant composition pyramids.29 At the rela-\ntively wide base, the biaxial strain is large and positive, as\nobserved in the bulk of the symmetric rings of Fig. 1, reflect-\ning that the InAs in the dot experiences a net compression in\nthe x-y plane and an extension in the @001# ~growth! direc-\ntion. Near the top however the situation tends to be reversed,\nso that the biaxial strain can even change sign.29 Because the\nheavy-hole potential includes a contribution proportional to\n\u00abax , the heavy-hole well is deepest at the base of the ring,\ntending to push the hole wave function towards the base. The\npiezoelectric potential then adds to this effect, localizing the\nhole in the ~110! plane, where the piezoelectric potential\nmaximizes the depth of the heavy-hole potential well. By\ncontrast, the electron potential does not depend on the biaxial\nstrain, and so the electrons do not experience an equivalent\nstrain-induced attraction towards the ring base. However the\noverall ring shape causes the electron center of gravity to lie\nin the lower part of the ring, and the piezoelectric potential\ncan then partly localize the electron wave function of Fig.\n6~a! in the (11\u00af0) plane. The overall effect of ring shape,\nbiaxial strain, and piezoelectric potential give a calculated\nelectron-hole dipole of the same sign as the experimental03532one. The calculated value 20.3 nm is smaller in magnitude\nthan the experimental result ;21 nm.\nTo come up with a more realistic representation of the\nself-assembled quantum rings, we note that for the structures\nin Figs. 6~a! and 6~b!, the mean lateral radii calculated for\nthe electron and hole wave functions are 20.4 nm and 21.0\nnm, respectively. The electron radius is considerably larger\nthan that deduced in the capacitance spectroscopy where the\nfield for the s to p transition implies an electron radius of 14\nnm. Given that the structural radius is known from the\natomic force micrograph, this result on the electron radius\nsuggests that either we are overestimating the lateral extent\nof the ring, or that the InxGa12xAs ring has a lateral compo-\nsition gradient such that the ring is indium rich at the inner\nradius and more dilute at the outer radius. In the first case, a\nsmaller outer radius tends to push the electron wave function\ntowards the ring center. In the second case, the high indium\nconcentration rim attracts both electrons and holes, again\npulling the carrier wave functions towards the center. The\npossibility of an indium-rich rim has been suggested from a\ndiscussion of ring formation.9,12 We consider the possibility\nof a reduced outer radius in detail here as it involves fewer\nassumptions about the ring shape.\nFigures 6~c! and 6~d! are surface plots of the ground-state\nelectron and hole probability densities for an InAs\/GaAs\nquantum ring with a 45 nm outer diameter, reduced from the\n60 nm outer diameter in Figs. 6~a! and 6~b!. The ground-state\nhole wave function remains pinned on the ~110! plane. As\nbefore, the piezoelectric potential is strong enough to prevent\nthe hole wave function from propagating around the ring.\nHowever, the ground-state electron wave function is more\ndelocalized around the ring than for the larger ring. The rea-\nson for this is that the reduced ring volume weakens the\npiezoelectric potential, so that the localizing effects of the\npiezoelectric field are smaller. This structure has therefore\nboth a large electron-hole overlap ~0.7! and an extended elec-\ntron wave function. Furthermore, the separation between the\nmean positions of the electron and hole wave functions in-7-7\nJ. A. BARKER, R. J. WARBURTON, AND E. P. O\u2019REILLY PHYSICAL REVIEW B 69, 035327 ~2004!creases to 0.5 nm, with the same sign as in the experiments.\nThe increase in electron-hole dipole moment is caused by the\ngreater delocalization of the electron wave function, decreas-\ning the overlap of the electron wave function with the piezo-\nelectric potential maxima, and hence decreasing the extent to\nwhich the electron wave function is pulled downwards by the\npiezoelectric potential. Finally, the lateral radii of the elec-\ntron and hole wave functions decrease to 17.4 and 17.5 nm,\nrespectively, so that the electron radius is reasonably consis-\ntent with the result of the capacitance spectroscopy. We find\nvery similar results for a ring with outer diameter 60 nm but\na radial indium concentration profile. In the terms of this\ndiscussion, this is a natural result, as also in this case, the\neffective ring volume is decreased.\nIn our calculations we inevitably retain a certain degree of\nsymmetry whereas in the real self-assembled quantum rings,\nthere is no reason to expect any exact rotational symmetry.\nThe atomic force micrograph of Fig. 4 shows a clear lateral\nasymmetry in the ring shape. The rings are ellipsoidal, with\nthe major axis along the @11\u00af0# direction @i.e., in the ~110!\nplane#. We saw in Figs. 3~e! and 3~f! how this tends to local-\nize the electrons and the holes in the ~110! plane, thus further\nincreasing the magnitude of the dipole moment in a ring with\nsloping walls. The electrons are pushed towards the base by\nthe piezoelectric potential in the (11\u00af0) plane, as noted in\nFig. 6~a!. The ring asymmetry will increase the magnitude of\nthe electron amplitude in the ~110! plane, where the piezo-\nelectric potential then acts to push the electron towards the\ntop of the ring, and the hole towards the base. Hence, the\nlarge observed magnitude of the electron-hole in-built dipole\nis consistent with the AFM data on uncapped rings, which\nshow a large asymmetry both in the vertical direction, where\nthe ring has sloping outer walls, and also in the growth plane,\nwhere the rings are elongated in the ~110! plane.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have used one-band electron and hole Hamiltonians to\ninvestigate the wave functions of the ground-state electron\nand hole levels for nanometer-sized self-assembled quantum\nrings. We have considered both generic effects and also a\ngeometry appropriate to real self-assembled rings. We find\nthat even for a perfect self-assembled ring, the piezoelectric\npotential breaks the rotational symmetry, resulting in maxima\nin the electron confining potential with associated minima in\nthe hole confining potential, every 180\u00b0 as a carrier propa-\ngates at constant radius around the ring. The consequences of\nthis depend on the strength of the piezoelectric field. For a\nring with a very strong piezoelectric potential, the electron\nand hole wave functions are both localized in their respective\npotential minima, with a small overlap between each other.\nFor a weaker piezoelectric potential, the hole wave function03532is localized but, owing to the small electron mass, the elec-\ntron wave function is delocalized around the ring. Finally, for\nvery small volume rings where the piezoelectric field is\nsmall, both the electron and the hole wave functions are ex-\ntended around the ring.\nWe have attempted to reproduce the results of spectros-\ncopy experiments on real self-assembled quantum rings by\nvarying the shape and composition profile of the quantum\nring maintaining a consistency with AFM measurements. We\nfind that both an asymmetric vertical profile and a radial\nindium concentration gradient are required to account for the\nexperimental results. A vertical asymmetry is needed to ac-\ncount for the large excitonic dipole moments and a radial\nasymmetry is required to account for the radius of the elec-\ntron wave function deduced from capacitance-voltage mea-\nsurements in a magnetic field. We find that for a conical\ncross section and plausible radii and indium concentrations,\nthe hole wave function is localized in the (110) plane. The\nhole is localized in this plane over quite a wide range of\nparameter space. Furthermore, the hole localization is en-\nhanced in practice by the slight elongation of the rings ~Fig.\n4!. However, the nature of the electron wave function de-\npends critically on the parameters, being localized in the\n(11\u00af0) plane for large volume, high indium concentration\nrings, extended around the ring for small volume rings, and\nlocalized in the (110) plane with the hole for rings which are\nsignificantly elongated in the (110) plane. We suggest a\nstructure which is compatible with the spectroscopy experi-\nments, namely a conical cross section with maximum height\n;5 nm, inner radius ;15 nm, outer radius ;30 nm with a\nradial indium concentration gradient, going from high-\nindium concentration at the inner radius to small indium con-\ncentration at the outer radius.\nThe results do not rule out the observation of excitonic\nAharanov-Bohm effects in self-assembled rings because\nAharanov-Bohm effects are possibly preserved by the elec-\ntron wave function which can be delocalized around the ring.\nHowever, the results demonstrate that hole localization in the\n(110) plane is very important. This feature is absent from all\nexisting theories of the excitonic properties of self-assembled\nrings in a magnetic field. It is therefore an important task to\ninclude both piezoelectric\/strain effects and excitonic effects\nto understand the properties of self-assembled quantum rings\nin a magnetic field.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank John Davies, Jorge M.
