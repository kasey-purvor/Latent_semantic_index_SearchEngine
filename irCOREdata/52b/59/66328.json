To form the workflow for a \nvirtual organization we need to find a sequence of \ninterrelated services (the grid\/web resources) matched \nto given users\u2019 requirements. It is crucial to find a \nsemantic description for virtual organizations in order \nto analyze various components, such as tasks, services, \nand resources, and hence to make virtual organization \nworkflows through semantic matching between tasks \nand services. In this paper, we propose a contextual \nbased semantic description approach to the semantic \ndescription of virtual organization components, tasks \nand services. The contextual information for a \nresource or a service or a task is the information \nprovided in the application domains and the pre-\ndefined (standardized) service ontology descriptions. \nWe also propose a semantic matching theory for \nmatching the tasks with the services. \n \n1. Introduction \n \nThe grid is an emerging platform to support on-\ndemand \u201cvirtual organizations\u201d for coordinated \nresource sharing and problem solving on a global scale \n[6]. The real and specific problem that underlies the \ngrid concept is coordinated resource sharing and \nproblem solving in dynamic, multi-institutional virtual \norganizations [4]. A virtual organization is formed to \ntemporarily and dynamically manage and organize a \ncollection of resources or services (sometimes called \nnodes) for a given purpose or task. Each node in the \norganization plays a different role and performs a \ndifferent activity and these nodes should coordinate \nand cooperate so that the different efforts and functions \ncan be integrated to achieve a given goal. \nBecause these nodes in the grid\/web are usually \nheterogeneous, autonomous, have different structures \nand purposes, and possess different characteristics and \nontologies, it is unavoidable for the nodes to \nexperience a painful process of communications and \nunderstanding before reaching a consensus and \nforming a virtual organization. During this process, \ncommonalities and distinctions in perceptions of \norganizational structures, domain problems, \ncommunity terminologies, business strategies, and \ndomain ontologies are analyzed, described, and \nrepresented. \nTo build up a virtual organization we need to define \na high-level task as a goal of the organization, for \nexample, \u201cto acquire the knowledge of Semantic \nWeb\u201d. It is natural that this task will be decomposed \ninto a number of subtasks. Each non-decomposable, \nleaf task corresponds to one or several services. The \nprocess of task decomposition supports forming the \nworkflow of the virtual organization. The activities \nwithin a task include the process of requesting, \ncomparing, selecting, consuming, integrating, and \nreleasing services and resources.  \nServices are considered to be applications or \nfunctions used by the agents or other services. Services \nare distributed without any central control. Many \nservices are orchestrated together to meet the \nrequirements of a task. In the grid\/web environment, \nthere are a lot of resources and it is the function of \nservices to organize and consume them. \nTraditional workflow model concerns the execution \ndependence between tasks [16]. It also concerns the \ndependence between services available for the virtual \norganization and time sequence dependence. \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We \ndiscuss the tasks and services and then introduce a \ncontext based semantic model for virtual organizations \nin section 2. In section 3, we discuss the semantic \ncomparison and matches. In section 4, we conclude the \npaper. \nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE\/WIC\/ACM International Conference\non Web Intelligence (WI 2006 Main Conference Proceedings)(WI'06)\n0-7695-2747-7\/06 $20.00  \u00a9 2006\n \n2. Semantic model for VO components \n \nThe core components in a virtual organization are \ntasks and services. Tasks are considered to be the final \nrepresentation of users\u2019 demands and requirements \nwhereas services are the conceptual clustering of \nresources. Between tasks and services, a semantic \nmatching process is, based on the properties of the \ntasks, to discover the most suitable services that satisfy \nthe tasks. Once this semantic match is completed, the \ntasks and the services will bind together to form the \nvirtual organization workflow for the given objectives. \nIn this section, we will first discuss general \ndescriptive (and contextual) information for virtual \norganization components and then propose the \ncontextual based semantic characteristic model. \n \n2.1. Tasks and services \n \nIn a virtual organization, tasks are the major \ncomponents, which realize the end users requirements, \nconstruct workflows, and discover and match services. \nIn other words, the tasks represent and formulate the \nusers\u2019 demands and requirements at one end and \ndeliver the basic services and consume the resources at \nthe other end. It is obvious that the decomposition \noperation is a most fundamental one on the tasks. By \napplying the decomposition operation, the tasks form a \ntree structure, which supports to construct and schedule \nworkflows for the virtual organization. A task is \nsemantically described as follows: \n\u2022 Task name: a concept name is used to represent \nthe concept of a task. \n\u2022 Description: a natural language description of the \ntask. \n\u2022 Inputs: a set of inputs to the task and their types. \nThe inputs are from other tasks. \n\u2022 Output: a set of outputs from the task and their \ntypes. The output is to an adjacent task. \n\u2022 Decomposition: this is a specific relationship \nbetween two tasks. This relationship results in a set \nof subtasks. In OWL-S [11], this relationship can \nbe viewed to be similar to subClassOf, partOf. This \nforms an ontology tree for the concept of the tasks \nand services. \n \nServices are considered to be pieces of software or \nsoftware components providing functions for the users \nto support their applications. The main problems with \nservice are, among others, semantic description and \ndiscovery for services. OWL-S provides an ontology \nlanguage for web services.  \nOur representation model considers the description \ncapability for both the features at the high level of \nbusiness objectives for tasks and at the low, concrete \nlevel of functionalities for services. Therefore, using \npart of OWL-S capacity, a service is described as \nfollows: \n\u2022 Service name: the name for the service. \n\u2022 Description: a set of data that describe the service, \ne.g., service description in natural language, service \ncreator, service creation time, etc. \n\u2022 Inputs: a set of inputs and their types. The inputs to \nthe service are from other services. The types of the \ninputs can help restricting the selection of services. \n\u2022 Output: an output and its type. The output of the \nservice is usually an input of the other service. The \ntype also helps with the selection of services. \n\u2022 Ontology: for a given domain a group of \nontologies have been pre-defined for describing \nservices. It is important to note the group of domain \nrelated ontologies is critical for semantic matching \nbetween tasks and services. \n \n2.2. Contextual based semantic model \n \nThe initial concept for semantic contextual model is \nbased on the belief that the identification of meaning of \na concept mainly stems from its contexts, i.e. its \nrelationships to other concepts. For example, we can \nidentify that A is an airline company in the sentence \n\u201ccompany A provides services of transporting people \nand goods by air\u201d. In this example, only one pair \n<relationship, concept> (e.g. <transport, people>) for \nfiguring out the meaning of A is, at most of time, not \nsufficient. Actually, in a given circumstance, we can \nmanage to collect a number of such pairs for \nidentifying a concept. \nUsing the contextual based semantic model \nproposed for tasks and services, we can construct a \nsemantic description structure for a task and a service. \nFor simplicity and without loss of generality, we will \nnot distinguish the descriptive differences between \ntasks and services. We use node to represent a task or a \nservice. A semantic description structure for a node is \nillustrated in Fig. 1. \nDefinition 1 (Basic semantic characteristic \nmodel) A semantic context model is a directed graph G \n= (V, E), where V is a set of concepts and E a set of \nsemantic relations between concepts. For each concept \nv in V, there is a function \u03bb: V \u2192 E\u00d7V, that \u03bb(v) = \n{<ei, vi>|ei \u2208 E, vi \u2208V}. We call \u03bb the semantic \ncharacteristic function, {<ei, vi>} the semantic pair set. \nThis set is considered to be able to (uniquely ideally) \nidentify v. \n \nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE\/WIC\/ACM International Conference\non Web Intelligence (WI 2006 Main Conference Proceedings)(WI'06)\n0-7695-2747-7\/06 $20.00  \u00a9 2006\nNiNi-1 Ni+1\nN\u2019\nf*\nI* O\nM\n \nFig. 1 The contextual characteristics of a node Ni include \nits ontology or parent relationship f to its parent node N\u2019, its \ninputting relationships I* from the node Ni-1, its output O to \nthe node Ni+1, and its attributes (i.e. metadata) M. \nOur assumption is that if v is semantically related or \nsemantically equivalent to w, where v and w are two \nnodes (concepts) in the graph G, then \u03bb(v) \u2229 \u03bb(w) \u2260 \u2205 \nor  \u03bb(v) = \u03bb(w), i.e. the set of contextual characteristics \nof v is intersected with or identical to that of w. \nDefinition 2 (Semantic f-characteristic) The \nsemantic f-characteristic of v, denoted to be \u03bbf(v), is a \npair of edge e and node w, that is, \u03bbf(v) = <e, w>. The \ngeneralized semantic f-characteristic of v, denoted to \nbe \u03bbf*(v), is a set of pairs <ei, wi>, where ei and wi are \nedges and nodes respectively and \u03bbf*(wi-1) = <ei, wi>. \nDefinition 3 (Semantic I-characteristic) The \nsemantic I-characteristic of v, denoted to be \u03bbI(v), is a \nset of input and inputting node pairs, i.e., \u03bbI(v) = {<i, \nw> | i \u2208 I and w \u2208 W}. Here I and W are inputting \nrelationships and nodes respectively in the graph G. \nWe also define a function #: 2S -> P to indicate the size \nof the set, i.e., #(S) = p, where S \u2208 2S (the power set of \nS) and p \u2208 P is a non-negative integer set. We also \ndefine one more metadata, T, called the type of an \ninput edge. That is, T(i) is the type of the edge \n(relationship). \nDefinition 4 (Semantic O-characteristic) The \nsemantic O-characteristic of v, denoted to be \u03bbO(v), is a \npair of output relationship and its connecting node, i.e., \n\u03bbO(v) = <o, w>, where o is the output edge from v to \nthe node w. Like in the previous definition for I \ncharacteristic, we also define one more metadata, T, \ncalled the type of an output edge. That is, T(o) is the \ntype of the edge (relationship). \n \n3. Semantic Matches \n \nA key step in construction of a virtual organization \nis the matching process where a sequence of tasks, \nwhich formally represents the users\u2019 demands, is \nsemantically matched to a set of services, which are \navailable in a service pool. The proposed contextual \nbased semantic comparison and measure approach \nincludes three steps: to compare the individual nodes \nforming the task sequence with the nodes from the \nservice pool, to find candidate service pairs that satisfy \nthe task pairs, to assemble the service pairs into a \nsequence of services that meet the requirements of the \nsequence of tasks. \n \n3.1. Semantic relatedness for nodes \n \nThe first step to find a semantic match of two nodes \nis to compare their contextual characteristics of the \nnodes, i.e. f-characteristic, I-characteristic, and O-\ncharacteristic. \nSuppose that v and w are two nodes (e.g. one task \nand one service) from two graphs, G and H. (Note that \nthe symbol \u2245 indicates that the two sets share some \ncommon elements.)  \nDefinition 5 (semantic f-related \u2013 ss-f) We define \nthat v and w are semantic f-related, i.e. (v, w) \u2208 ss-f if \n\u03bbf*(v) \u2245 \u03bbf*(w). \nDefinition 6 (semantic I-related \u2013 ss-I) We define \nthat v and w are semantic I-related, i.e. (v, w) \u2208 ss-I if \n\u03bbI(v) \u2245 \u03bbI(w) and #(\u03bbI(v)) = #(\u03bbI(w)) and T(iv) \u2245 T(iw), \nwhere iv \u2208 Iv and iw \u2208 Iw. \nDefinition 7 (semantic O-related \u2013 ss-O) We \ndefine that v and w are semantic O- related, i.e. \u03bbO(v, \nw) \u2208 ss-O if \u03bbO(v) \u2245 \u03bbO(w) and T(iv) \u2245 T(iw), where iv \n\u2208 Iv and iw \u2208 Iw. \n \n3.2. Semantic relatedness for pairs of nodes \n \nThe second step is semantic comparison and match \nfor node pairs. Suppose that G and H are two graphs. \nWe consider two adjacent nodes, ti and ti+1, from the \ngraph G. After the first step, for ti and ti+1, we get two \nsets of nodes, Si = {s1i, \u2026, smi} and Si+1 = {s1,i+1, \u2026, \ns\nn,i+1}. All these nodes are from the graph H. We obtain \na set of service pairs and the services in each pair \npossess an interdependent relationship in terms of their \ninputs and outputs. The interdependence structure for a \nservice pair is illustrated in Fig. 2. \nDefinition 8 (semantic pair-related - spr) We \ndefine that, for a given pair of nodes, denoted to be ti-\nti+1, any pair of nodes si-si+1 where si \u2208 Si = {s1i, \u2026, \nsmi} and si+1 \u2208 Si+1 = {s1,i+1, \u2026, sn,i+1}, is semantic pair-\nrelated to ti-ti+1, i.e. (ti-ti+1, si-si+1) \u2208 spr, if both (ti, si) \nand (ti+1, si+1) belong to the semantic relatedness \nrelations:  ss-f, ss-I, and ss-O at the same time, and \n\u03bbO(si) \u2282 \u03bbI(si+1). \nSimply put it, this definition means that if there is a \nsuitable input\/output interdependence (or match) \nbetween two service nodes si and si+1 and if there is a \nsemantic inclusion relation between ti and si, and ti+1 \nand si+1, respectively, the pair si-si+1 is a suitable \ncandidate pair matching the pair ti-ti+1. \n \nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE\/WIC\/ACM International Conference\non Web Intelligence (WI 2006 Main Conference Proceedings)(WI'06)\n0-7695-2747-7\/06 $20.00  \u00a9 2006\nNiNi-1 Ni+1\nNi\u2019\nfi*\nI*\nMi Mi+1\nNi+2\nO\nNi+1\u2019\nfi+1*\n \nFig. 2 A semantic contextual representation of the pair of \nnodes Ni and Ni+1. \n3.3. Semantic relatedness for node sequences \n \nThe last step is sequence semantic match, where we \ncreate a sequence of services out from the above-\nobtained candidate pairs of service nodes for the given \nsequence of tasks. Through iteratively applying the \ndefinitions given above, we get one or several \ncandidate sequences of services that match the given \ntask sequence. Here we should emphasize the \nimportance of service scheduling which plays a critical \nrole in this step because we consider that all the \nservices used in the virtual organization are \ndynamically coupled and composed. Again, an \nimportant factor in the service scheduling process is \nhow to measure quantitatively the semantic distance \nfrom the candidate services, service pairs, and service \nsequences to the given task sequence and its \ncomponents (given tasks and task pairs). This approach \nhas been further explored in [14]. \n \n3.4. Constructing workflow \n \nNow, we see that there is a one-to-one mapping \nfrom the leaf tasks to the services. Using the preceding \nand the successor relations between the leaf tasks, we \ncan get the following an ordered sequence: T1 << T2 << \n\u2026 << T\nn\n, where Ti, 1<i<n, is the ith leaf task in the leaf \ntask set. We call this sequence as the workflow of this \nvirtual organization and the corresponding sequence of \nthe services, S1 << S2 << \u2026 << Sn, where Si, 1<i<n, is \nthe ith service, as an implementation of the workflow. \nThe formation of a virtual organization is illustrated in \nFig. 3. \nHere a virtual organization starts from a high level \ntask for general users\u2019 requirements and demands. The \ntask is decomposed into subtasks, which are in turn \nfurther decomposed, and hence form a task hierarchy. \nThe leaf tasks form the workflow of the virtual \norganization. The task hierarchy consists of the \nmodeling for the users\u2019 requirements. The services \nwhich match the leaf tasks form an implementation of \nthe workflow. The service sequence layer with the \nworkflow represents the service design and matching. \nThe resources layer with the service sequence is the \nresource discovery and assembly. \nT\n... TT\n...

Conclusion \n \nUsing the contextual semantic characteristics of a \nconcept is an effective way to describe and identify the \nconcept. In this paper, based on the work in [13], we \nproposed a contextual based semantic model to \ndescribe virtual organization components, in particular, \ntasks and services. One of the advantages is that the \nmodel is convenient to generate quantitative analysis \non the components and hence easy to develop an \nautomatic processing of semantic comparison and \nmatch of the components. \nVirtual organizations have become an important \nsubject in many application areas, for example e-\nBusiness, but how to semantically describe the \ncomponents in a virtual organization and hence form a \ntemporary and dynamic virtual organization is still a \nbig problem as the diverse and distributed components, \nsuch as tasks, services, workflows, and resources, are \nvery complex and volatile. Automation of virtual \norganization formation is our main goal in \ndevelopment of semantic web applications and \nsemantic web service applications. \n \n* Related Work and References \nDue to the page limitation, the sections Related Work \nand References were omitted.
