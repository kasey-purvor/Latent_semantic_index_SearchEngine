That analytical students too were more receptive to study when\nconnected with their instrument was the cue for the present article; performance has much\nto offer the teaching\/learning of non-tonal analytical techniques founded on the basic\ntenets of set theory. This article details an experimental curriculum, \u2018Practising set theory\u2019,\ntested at Lancaster University across 2001\u20132, in comparison with more traditional methods\nemployed across 1995\u20132002, and in relation to the new \u2018Music benchmark statement\u2019\n(2002). Beyond the specifics, it is hoped this research may interest other practitioners\nseeking alternative pedagogical approaches to parts of the Music curriculum perceived as\ndifficult or especially demanding.\nI n t r o d u c t i o n\nWe have come a long way from the days when it was assumed that analysis had all\nthe answers (e.g. Berry, 1989) and that these should be imparted to grateful performers\nthrough a one-way street of knowledge flow. The truth is that analysts have at least\nas much to gain through the practice of performance, and that performance is as cap-\nable of setting an agenda for analysis as vice versa. Indeed, performers are analysts\nin the sense that they too are involved in an aesthetic, experiential interpretation of\nthe music. It is also true that, whilst the new Music benchmarking statement (March\n2002; www.qaa.ac.uk\/crntwork\/benchmark\/phase2\/music.pdf) rightly extols the virtues of\nsynthesising \u2018academic\u2019 and performing disciplines, students may not fully explore the\ninterplay unless we encourage them to do so through imaginative curriculum design. Even\nin a UK university setting, a pigeonhole mentality exists that sometimes makes it difficult\nfor students to apply insights learnt in one part of a course within another. Beyond this\nsetting, it is hoped that some of the ideas raised here may enjoy a wider resonance, both\nat secondary school\/college level and overseas. Certainly, the earlier and more widely\nthat \u2018academic\u2019\/performance interplay is explored, the greater the long-term benefits, with\npotentially higher levels of learning outcomes.\nThe basic arguments for a pedagogical synthesis between analysis and performance\nwere rehearsed in a previous article (Mawer, 1999), and, whilst there is no purpose in\nsimply restating them here, a summary and discursive update \u2013 emphasising relationships\nwith Music benchmarking and educational research \u2013 should be helpful.\n257\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nDebo rah Mawer\nAlthough distinctive \u2018joint\u2019 courses, such as those pioneered between the Royal\nNorthern College of Music and Manchester University or between King\u2019s College London\nand the Royal Academy of Music, continue to thrive in a logistically circumscribed way,\nthe idea of interdisciplinarity is now also being pursued rather more successfully within\nindividual institutions. The reasons for this increased synthesis within conservatoires and\nuniversities no doubt relate at some level to the instigation of the UK Research Assessment\nExercise, and, more arguably, to a parallel raising of the status of teaching and learning\npractices.\nThe desirability of \u2018academic\u2019\/performance synthesis is also well reflected in the new\nUKMusic benchmarks; these benchmarks, now in place for most subject disciplines, seek to\nestablish minimum standards of expected attainment and subject knowledge\/skill coverage\nacross wide-ranging curricula offered at institutions of higher education (HE). Thus, such\nbenchmarks go some way towards the equivalent of a National Curriculum for UK higher\neducation, whilst still enabling greater curricular scope and diversity than exists presently\nat primary or secondary school level.\nIn its discussion of teaching, learning and assessment, the Music benchmark statement\nacknowledges that \u2018the study of music at HE level [and other levels] is intrinsically multi-\ndisciplinary\u2019 (Programme design: 5.1.1). One may consider, for instance, the second bullet\npoint on performance skills (4.1.2), which foregrounds \u2018powers of interpretation: the ability\nto find creative links between the results of personal research, textual and musical analysis,\nscholarship, reflection and listening skills, and the process of performing\u2019.\nUnder general skills, it is refreshing to see reference to \u2018enhanced powers of\nimagination\/creativity\u2019, highlighting \u2018curiosity and the desire to explore\u2019 and \u2018openness\nto new, personal, different or alternative thinking\u2019. (Analytically speaking, the need to\nencourage \u2018creative thought\u2019 was part of the motivation behind the previous \u2018Voice-leading\nfor Strings\u2019 project \u2013 a motivation shared by a previous analytical contributor to this journal\n(Howell, 1996: 124\u20135).) The most relevant portions of the benchmarks (Standards 6.2) are\nfound under \u2018Knowledge and understanding (intellectual skills)\u2019, where even at a basic\nthreshold level, honours Music students should be able \u2018to show an understanding of\nthe relationship between theory and practice in music\u2019, and under \u2018Practical skills and\nmusicianship\u2019, where students should \u2018demonstrate a measure of personal expression,\nimagination and creativity in practical music-making . . . and the ability to communicate\nthrough music employing appropriate technical and interpretative means\u2019.\nIt is equally important that we should practise what we preach by exploring alternative,\nimaginative and creative teaching\/learning methods. In fact, the possibility of employing\n\u2018practical exercises\u2019 (though not defined in detail) is mentioned in the section on teaching\nand learning methods (5.3.2), \u2018usually connected with the development of creative,\nanalytical and aural skills\u2019. Clearly, the establishing of a strong ideological foundationwithin\nthe Music benchmarking does not in itself endorse the specific proposal connecting set-\ntheoretic analysis and performance, whichmust stand or fall on its ownmerits. Nonetheless,\nthe seriousness with which musical interrelationships are pursued in the benchmarks\nprovides a context that usefully reflects recent UK practice (including the earlier \u2018Voice-\nleading for Strings\u2019 initiative).\nApart from benchmarking, the proposal for an alternative analytical curriculum\nconnects to the conviction that it is imperative for the future of analysis that it be both\n258\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nEn l i v en i ng ana l y s i s t h r ough pe r f o rmance\nintellectually fascinating and fun (Mawer, 1992: 8). This criterion of fun is especially crucial\n(and tested) when devising teaching\/learning methods for non-tonal analysis in the shape\nof set theory. This concern to increase the accessibility of music analysis is also one shared\nin the pages of this journal by Tim Howell (Howell, 1996: 124\u20135). Beyond analysis, the\nconnection between student interest and motivation has been well made in an Australian\ninstrumental teaching context by James Renwick and Gary McPherson: \u2018Motivational\nresearch in academic subjects has demonstrated that when students are interested in\nan activity . . . they are more likely to engage in higher-level cognitive functioning, find\nit easier to concentrate, persevere, and enjoy their learning\u2019 (Renwick & McPherson,\n2002: 173). The fact that we, as researchers, do not always consider this dimension\nsufficiently is also articulated in this same source: \u2018research on motivational aspects of\nmusical learning has largely bypassed interest and intrinsic motivation\u2019. (For more on this\ntopic, including the importance of enjoyment and also self-esteem, see Hallam, 2001:\n66\u20137.)\nWhat of the context for \u2018Practising set theory\u2019 in terms of broader music\neducational research? The idea of learning about music through a holistic and balanced\napproach which acknowledges its multifaceted nature has been well established in\nKeith Swanwick\u2019s extensive UK research; perhaps most influential has been Swanwick\u2019s\ntheoretical\/philosophical model, CLASP (Composition; Literature Studies; Audition; Skill\nacquisition; Performance), eloquently propounded some 20 years ago (Swanwick, 1979).\nMore recently, American educational research that has influenced \u2018Practising set theory\u2019\nhas been articulated in Music Matters (Elliott, 1995); this is not to take on board\nDavid Elliott\u2019s ideas wholesale, which would probably lose the music theory en\nroute. To Elliott, music is primarily about acts and experiences of physical doing:\n\u2018musicing\u2019, or music-making, as opposed essentially to Bennett Reimer\u2019s more traditional\naesthetic concept of music education (Reimer, 1970), which arguably advocates a more\npassive appreciation of a canon of masterworks. (For more on this whole debate,\nsee Plummeridge, 1999 and Finney, 2002.) Whilst Elliott\u2019s philosophy is founded\nessentially on pre-tertiary education (though written for tertiary-level students and\npractising teachers), there is no reason to believe that it stops being relevant at this\npoint. Most students and practitioners favour \u2018active learning\u2019 at any stage: witness the\ntitle of the new journal of the Institute of Learning and Teaching: Active Learning in Higher\nEducation.\nFor Elliott, emphasis is on \u2018the centrality of performing and improvising\u2019; it is his\ncontention that \u2018performing and improvising . . . ought to be the foundational and primary\nforms of music making taught and learned in music education programs. Arranging,\ncomposing, and conducting (when germane) should also be included systematically when\ntime permits\u2019 (Elliott, 1995: 172). Such a philosophy relates strongly to the means, if not the\nends, of my own set-theoretic project which also involves improvisation and composition\n(viewed as intersecting sets \u2013 see Burnard, 2000: 21), whilst privileging performance\nin order to emphasise sound (and listening). This choice is made notwithstanding\nwell-argued reservations expressed by Swanwick in a study with markedly younger\nstudents, where \u2018performance usually elicits lower levels of musical understanding,\nsignificantly different from either composing or audience-listening\u2019 (Swanwick & Franca,\n1999: 5).\n259\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nDebo rah Mawer\nTh e po t e n t i a l b e n efi t s o f t e a c h i n g ana l y s i s ( p a r t i a l l y ) t h r o ugh\np e r f o rmanc e\nIt has been argued that, in addition to the essentials of technique, instrumental teachingmust\nalso be about the holistic development of musicianship (Wright, 1998); similarly, beyond its\ntechnical essentials, analytical teaching should also concern itself with musicianship. The\nuse of performance in teaching analysis, or other academic material, can be immensely\nvaluable for various reasons. It ensures that students are not just passive onlookers at\nproducts; they are actively engaged in the analytical processes being explored. As Elliott\nnotes: \u2018A student\u2019s involvement in making develops his or her ability to shift concentration\nback and forth between the process of making . . . and the outcome of his efforts\u2019 (Elliott,\n1995: 173). Implicit is that the sheer variety of activities and pacing plays a significant\nrole in stimulating learning. Peer pressure is also a healthy influence: if students are likely\nto be asked to contribute to the class both on their instruments and verbally, they cannot\nafford to switch off and leave the doing to someone else. Thus performance encourages\nresponsibility for part of the learning process: \u2018To give attention to how things are done . . . is\nto modify one\u2019s viewpoint and understanding. Students so informed expand their sense of\nresponsibility and the locus of their energy\u2019 (ibid.).\nOf course, this view rather takes for granted that the thing being done is worth doing:\nthe crucial components here are value and creativity. To get started, a student must have\nan initial conviction about the value, relevance and applicability of a curriculum topic \u2013\nthe \u2018why\u2019 as well as the \u2018what\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019. For study to be sustained, there must be creative\nspace left open for the student analyst-cum-performer to explore and question; mutual trust\nis needed to foster greater student responsibility and involvement. The more this enquiry\nstimulates imagination and enjoyment, the more likely it is to surmount the inevitable\nhurdles and doubts. At the heart of this creativity is music as physical sound in time \u2013 to be\nfelt, heard and responded to. For musical performance in conjunction with analysis, this\n\u2018feeling\u2019 of the music can take on powerful proprioceptive qualities: in other words, there\ncan be a strong correspondence between perceptions of musical structure and the physical\nmovements (of instrument, fingering, breathing, etc.) involved in the phenomenology of\nmusic \u2013 the \u2018translating\u2019 of such structures into sound.\nBeyond the more obvious benefits of teaching analysis at least partially through\nperformance are those which relate to peer learning (see Hunter, 1999); when analytical\nideas are performed in a class setting, engaging students in supportive critique and formative\nassessment follows on very naturally.\nWhy t h e ( c o n t i n u i n g ) n e e d f o r n o n - t o n a l a n a l y s i s , e s p e c i a l l y s e t t h e o r y ?\nSo far this article is perhaps hardly controversial, but at this point the sceptic (or, somewould\nclaim, \u2018realist\u2019) might question the relevance of non-tonal analysis, especially set theory.\nNonetheless, at an HE level, whether university or conservatoire, it is only by developing\na menu of suitable analytical\/interpretative approaches that we may properly engage with\nwestern European and other musics of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Such\ndiverse approaches may relate to both poietic\/creative and esthesic\/receptive dimensions,\nand to parameters of pitch, rhythm, timbre, texture and text, as appropriate; they may\n260\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nEn l i v en i ng ana l y s i s t h r ough pe r f o rmance\nbe directed by issues of contingent history, sociology, culture, gender issues, psychology,\nsemiotics, aesthetics, and so on.\nWhilst celebrating this diversification and interdisciplinarity and being aware that\npitch should not automatically be privileged above other parameters (especially in a\ntwentieth-century context), we should not lose sight of detailed pitch-orientated analyses.\nThere is presently a backlash against more formalist approaches \u2013 which, sensitively and\npurposefully employed, still have an important role to play \u2013 and a danger of moving to\nthe other extreme where students lack the technical armoury to pay close attention to the\nscore. This concern connects with secondary\/college-level musical study: within a \u2018new\nlook\u2019 Advanced-level (18+ examination) curriculum that admirably embraces breadth, it is\nprobably impossible not to lose something by way of technical depth. Nevertheless, when\ntwentieth-century repertory is being studied in the classroom or in instrumental lessons,\nthere remains a need for real probing of the music.\nArguably, the two most important pitch-orientated methods developed in the twentieth\ncentury were voice-leading analysis for tonal\/post-tonal music (see Mawer, 1999) and set\ntheory for atonal and other non-tonal musics, pioneered in what has become its definitive\nform by Allen Forte (Forte, 1973, 1988). Set theory especially has sometimes suffered from\na bad press and, on occasions, deservedly so. Its application must move with the times to\nenjoy a wider popularity, and this means maintaining and developing its musical relevance,\nrather than focusing on its abstracted systematic\/mathematical basis. (There are parallels\nwith the application of voice-leading, where it may or may not be useful for students to\nexplore the original metaphysical philosophies that directed Heinrich Schenker\u2019s thinking\n(Schenker, 1979).) We do not need to be over-purist about this; set theory may often\nprofitably be combined with other analytical\/interpretative approaches.\nIndeed, one reason for my favouring the broad term \u2018non-tonal\u2019 over the narrower\n\u2018atonal\u2019 is to point up the fact that voice-leading and set-theoretic (pedagogical) approaches\nmay enjoy a fruitful meeting point in many modal repertoires. In other words, there is\nsignificant common ground between my original \u2018Voice-leading for Strings\u2019 project and\nthe present \u2018sister\u2019 project. (From a set-theoretic stance, Allen Forte is explicit in his\nlater development of his 1973 theory that, in devising a modern harmonic species, he\nseeks to mediate between divorced tonal and atonal terms of reference (Forte, 1988).)\nPractically and analytically, it makes sense for students at various levels and in various\nlearning environments to expand their tonal thinking to embrace both modal and atonal\nconstructs.\nApp r o a ch e s t o t e a c h i n g non - t o n a l a n a l y s i s\nThese approaches have tended to focus upon versions of pitch-class set theory, a concept\nderived from mathematics which works within a fully chromatic modulo 12 system and\nlooks to group pitches and make connections between these groups (as a rough equivalent\nof tonality) in the context of non-tonal, often specifically atonal, music. Set theory was\nintroduced comprehensively within music by the American theorist Allen Forte (1973) and\nthen applied extensively in analysing Stravinsky\u2019s The Rite of Spring (Forte, 1978), but one\nshould not forget the pioneering roles of the composer-theorists Milton Babbitt (who first\ntalked of a \u2018pitch-class set\u2019; see Babbitt, 1955, 1961) and George Perle (1968). Beyond\n261\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nDebo rah Mawer\nthis basis, the most important development has been that of pitch-class set \u2018genera\u2019 (Forte,\n1988), as amore intuitive and convincingway of establishing large-scale family groupings of\nconnected sets, which has largely superseded the more difficult, mathematically abstracted,\nnotion of Kh complexes originally advocated by Forte.\nMaterial for teaching set theory includes Forte\u2019s text of 1973, although this is much\nmore a manifesto than a manual, and has never been user-friendly, not least because it\nemanates from a period in American music theory which sought to maximise the scientific\ndimension of music in a way that feels particularly alien to today\u2019s students. An early\napproach to teaching set theory which aimed \u2018to induce an enjoyable understanding of\natonal music, for listening, composing, or performing\u2019 was Basic Atonal Theory (Rahn,\n1980), though this text has dated and is still too mathematically involved for its musical\naims. More recent texts include those by Robert Morris (1987, 1991) and Joseph Straus\n(1990a), and, from a British perspective, Early Twentieth-Century Music in the series\nModels of Musical Analysis (Dunsby, 1993) and A Guide to Musical Analysis (Cook,\n1994). Mention should also be made of an attractively light-hearted introduction to set\ntheory by Peter Castine (1994) which incorporates aptly surreal quotations from Lewis\nCarroll!\nPerhaps one of themost imaginative texts, which still enjoys a faithful student following,\nis Analytic Approaches to Twentieth-Century Music (Lester, 1989). The strengths of Joel\nLester\u2019s book lie in the wealth of real music examples he imports, the existence of\nanalytical and compositional exercises, and most importantly the context that he provides\nfor set theory which acknowledges rhythm, metre, texture and timbre. To do this book\njustice, however, demands substantially more time for a twentieth-century course than is\nusually available; furthermore, the book was published too early to embrace Forte\u2019s useful\nformulation of pitch-class set genera of 1988.\nApart from these standard texts, set-theoretic teaching\/learning aids now prove highly\nsuitable to dissemination via the Internet, not least because of the increasing number of\nso-called set theory \u2018calculators\u2019 used to assist with the purely mechanical aspects of pitch-\nclass set identification and comparison (often by means of a keyboard), which may be\ndownloaded for both PC and Macintosh platforms. One particularly noteworthy web site\nwhich offers a comprehensive introduction to set theory is the Music Theory and Analysis\nsite, designed and maintained in the United States by the influential teacher and composer-\ncum-theorist Larry Solomon (2003): http:\/\/music.theory.home.att.net\/theory.htm. This site\nencompasses a lucid and accessible set-theoretic primer, a glossary of terms, a listing of\npitch-class sets, a \u2018calculator\u2019, and Solomon\u2019s updated Music Analysis System (1984, rev.\n2002). It also offers other relevant software, bibliographies, links to related web sites and\nsample analyses.

Student numbers varied both from\none academic session to another and between learning stages 1 (foundational level) and 2\n(specialist level).\nCurriculum design 1 aimed to provide the required introduction through standard\ncourse delivery: intensive interactive lectures and workshops across five weeks, using the\noriginal Kh complex version of set theory (see \u2018Approaches\u2019 above), and taught from 1995\nto 1999. Although student course data were collected for each session, in the interests of\nmanageability only data from the final year prior to design change are referred to here\n(Group A\/learning stage 1, 1998\u20139).\nDesign 2 delivered the same course objectives using the genera-based version of set\ntheory (for more detail, see the section \u2018Curriculum content\u2019 below), and was taught from\n2000 to 2002. The decision to opt for genera in the longer term was partly informed by the\nresponses of the trial Group A, then at learning stage 2 (1999\u20132000), who had the benefit\nof experiencing both versions: thus useful comparative data could be obtained from Group\nA1\/2. From this cohort (on 24\/25 questionnaire returns), some 40 per cent (10 students)\nfavoured the change to a genera basis alone; a further 24 per cent (6) advocated teaching\nboth methods; 16 per cent (4) wanted to preserve the status quo; whilst another 16 per\ncent (4) remained undecided. (Two additional sets of student course data were provided\nby Groups B and C, both at learning stage 1.)\nDesign 3: \u2018Practising set theory\u2019, genera-based, with performance-led classes, was\ntaught alongside design 2 from 2001 to 2002. Student course data are provided by Group\nB, at learning stage 2, who experienced both modes of delivery: thus further comparative\ndata may be obtained from Group B1\/2. The arguments for incorporating performance\nwithin set-theoretic study are essentially the same as those discussed more generally above,\nexcept that the need to inspire and engage students \u2013 to make learning enjoyable and\nfun \u2013 is more than usually acute.\n263\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nDebo rah Mawer\nCu r r i c u l um con t e n t : e x e r c i s e s a nd mus i c a l e x p l o r a t i o n s\n\u2018Practising set theory\u2019 works through a series of \u2018lessons\u2019, each of which contains three or\nso specific exercises designed to develop the set-theoretical basis through practical class\nactivity, supported by private study; the substantive content is summarised at the end. The\ncircumscribed exercises, to be played and improvised around, are supported by excerpts\nof real music which exemplify a particular technique and are to be performed on various\ninstruments.\nThe musical theory \u2018grows\u2019 from small to large scale as the student progresses: lesson\n1 is concerned with thinking and hearing in 12 semitones, thus rethinking a decade\nof focusing on seven-note scales! Students experiment with creating small chromatic\nsets, or cells, of pitches. At the other end, lesson 8 arrives at the large-scale panorama\nprovided by \u2018genera\u2019 \u2013 different sonic families comprising a number of related sets;\nthese \u2018types\u2019 may be characterised as: wholetone, diminished, augmented, chromatic,\natonal\/tonal hybrid, diatonic, and so on (see Forte, 1988). Students seem to like this\napproach, one (from Group B\/2, 2001\u20132) commenting that \u2018the set theory course is\ncleverly taught as it slowly builds up to the full picture, and doesn\u2019t overwhelm you at the\nstart\u2019.\nEn route, students will have learnt to observe and hear properties of particular sets,\nsuch as those with symmetrical pitch patterns (e.g. the pentatonic construct: C, D, F, G),\nor those which have common pitches when transposed (e.g. another pentatonic construct:\nC, F, B\u0001; F, B\u0001, E\u0001). They will also have identified and measured the extent of motivic\ndifference between slightly modified pitch patterns with the same number of notes (e.g. C,\nC#, D, E\u0001, expanded to C, C#, D, E), and will have perceived connections between sets of\ndifferent sizes (e.g. C, C#, E\u0001, as a subset of C, C#, E\u0001, E, F#, G), both at pitch and in various\ntranspositions.\nIn order to give a flavour of the content, it is useful to present selected examples from\nlessons 1, 2 and 8 in a little more detail. The initial exercise of lesson 1 asks students to start\nthinking in 12 semitones by practising chromatic scales \u2013 both played and sung \u2013 and by\nensuring that they can orientate themselves by means of labelled pitch classes (pcs) from\n0 to 11 (C\u2013B), as illustrated in Figure 2. Students then explore interval classes (ics), also\nworking from the nearest C pitch, as a logical point of reference. In this way, by making use\nof intervallic inversions and enharmonic equivalence, there is only a need for six interval\nclasses, as demonstrated in Figure 3.\nFig. 2 Labelling of pitch classes (pcs)\nAs the next exercise, students are asked to select a group of three pitches connected by\nsemitones, e.g. C, C#, D (0, 1, 2), which may be referred to as the most compact three-note\npitch-class (pc) set, 3\u20131. They are invited to play individually a brief improvisatory phrase\n264\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nEn l i v en i ng ana l y s i s t h r ough pe r f o rmance\nFig. 3 Labelling of interval classes (ics)\nFig. 4 Pc set 3\u20131; brief improvisation sample\nusing set 3\u20131, as in the unmeasured sample marked Mysteriously in Figure 4, and then\nto improvise circumscribed phrases of their own. Variety can be achieved even with such\nlimited means by rearranging the pitch ordering, selecting different registers, repetitions\nand ornamentations, e.g. trills, grace-notes; experimentation is encouraged through trying\nout varied metric\/rhythmic identities and contrasting styles, or characters (e.g. a student\nsuggestion of \u2018Dark and mystical\u2019).1\nExcerpts from the openings of the third and fourth of Andre\u00b4 Jolivet\u2019s delightfully\nimaginative and intricate Cinq incantations [Five Incantations] (1936) for solo flute are\nthen incorporated (Figure 5), to illustrate chromatic 3\u20131 (and expanded 5\u20131) cells in real\nmusical settings. These chromatic cells appear in what may be viewed as an untransposed\nformat, commencing on C, and also in transposition upon other scalic degrees. Although\noriginally intended for flute, the excerpt was tested out more freely within the pilot\nscheme on various treble-clef melody instruments, including violin: see \u2018Implementation\u2019\nbelow.\nTranspositions and reorderings are reinforced in a final exercise, with the 3\u20131 cell\nmoved from C, C#, D (arguably its prime-form (P0)) onto other scalic degrees: up\nfive semitones (t5), and up seven semitones (t7). Again, students are urged to find\nimprovisational possibilities, albeit still with restricted elements, as suggested by the\naccentuated 5\/8 sample marked Spritely in Figure 6. The clarinet might be particularly\nwell suited to articulating this little fragment. The selecting of suitable modal\/atonal styles\nand characterisations, such as those used by Barto\u00b4k or Stravinsky, is also helpful here (e.g.\na student suggestion of \u2018Solemn and lugubrious\u2019!).\nAt the end of this first lesson, Be\u00b4la Barto\u00b4k\u2019s Mikrokosmos, VI: \u2018From the diary of a fly\u2019\n(Figure 7) is offered as a musical example with opportunity for realisation (with repetition)\nas a light-hearted duo, e.g. for brass instruments, or voices.

Whilst the interval vector offers\na useful shorthand, and it is possible to \u2018play out\u2019 the full intervallic contents of a given set,\nthe idea is musically quite distanced and limited. Of greater potential (and applicability\nwithin the pilot scheme) is another Fortean concept introduced here: the possibility of one\nset being balanced by its polar opposite, e.g. sets 4\u20131 and 8\u20131, which together create a\nfully chromatic whole. The supporting exercise asks students to compose a short piece\nthat contrasts\/complements 4\u20131 and its opposite partner, 8\u20131, keeping the actual pitches\nmutually exclusive at first too: C, C#, D, E\u0001 and E, F, F#, G, A\u0001, A, B\u0001, B. A dialogue between\ntwo alternating \u2018voices\u2019 (sombre: legato, low register, and playful: staccato, upper register)\nis suggested in Figure 8; on the pilot scheme this was especially well illustrated by viola.\nOnce more the supporting musical example (Figure 9) makes reference to Barto\u00b4k, this time\nthe opening of the String Quartet No. 3 (1927): Prima parte, which contrasts a muted chord\nC#, D, D#, E (set 4\u20131) on second violin, viola and cello against the first violin\u2019s melodic\nline, comprising pitches E#, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, B# (set 8\u20131).

Again, improvisation is encouraged\nby creating brief pieces founded on, for instance: the wholetone pitch collections of\nGenus 2 (on C and C#, e.g. \u2018Dream-like\u2019 on piano); the diminished seventh frameworks\nof the diminished Genus 3 (on C, C#, and D, e.g. \u2018Thoughtful\u2019 on piano); modal contrast\nbetween the chromatic Genus 5 and the pentatonic type Genus 11 (e.g. \u2018Evil\/Dreamy\u2019 as\nan improvised piano duo, which created much class amusement within the trials!). This\ncoupling and contrasting of Genera 5 and 11 is highly germane to Barto\u00b4k\u2019s String Quartet\nNo. 3, as the focal point of the pilot scheme course.\nOnce students are familiar with the idea of genera, they may well want to experiment\nwith devising and playing their own contextually derived set groupings, along the lines of\nRichard Parks\u2019s valuable work on Debussy (Parks, 1989), rather than keeping with Forte\u2019s\nuniversal, abstracted system. Whilst acknowledging the reservations of some on the value\nof methodological analysis in the undergraduate curriculum (see Howell, 1996: 126\u20137),\nmy response is that, having had a basic, clear introduction to set theory, broadly along\nFortean lines, students are more likely to be in an informed and confident position to make\nadaptations and, in time, find their own routes.\nImp l emen t a t i o n o f \u2018 P r a c t i s i n g s e t t h e o r y \u2019 : p i l o t s c h eme ( 2 0 0 1\u20132 )\n\u2018Practising set theory\u2019 was tested informally at Lancaster University in 2001\u20132. The project\nwas embedded within a five-week third-year music techniques course (Group B\/stage 2\n(2001\u20132): 15 students) that focused on analysing Barto\u00b4k\u2019s String Quartet No. 3 through\nideas of complementation, contrast and difference. Set theory and pitch complementation\nconstituted the starting point for this enquiry, which then opened out to embrace other\nparameters, especially rhythm and texture. \u2018Practising set theory\u2019 was offered as a means\nof revising basic set-theoretic principles that had been learnt by Group B in the previous\nyear (in the design 2 format). Students experienced the learning package both within\nclassroom explorations and in their own private study on their principal instrument; in\n268\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nEn l i v en i ng ana l y s i s t h r ough pe r f o rmance\nturn, the package had at least an indirect impact upon the students\u2019 group presentations\nand subsequent individual, assessed assignments.\nF i n d i n g s\nThe informal findings were measured by various sets of questionnaires (taking heed of\nadvice in Cohen & Manion on the \u2018self-completion questionnaire\u2019 (1994: 92\u2013105)), verbal\ndiscussion, and recordings of class sessions. Final individual assessment levels were also\nanalysed as an additional indicator of the outcomes of the experiment. Given that the\nspecialist Group B\/2 student cohort was relatively small \u2013 15, as against 25 and 35 for\nsome of the other groups (see again Figure 1) \u2013 special consideration was afforded to\nqualitative responses in addition to basic quantitative results. Indeed, in view of the specific\nstudy aim to enliven and popularise a mathematical, computer-related analysis through\ncreative performance participation, acknowledgement of the human factor, especially\nindividual student voices, was more than usually important. (For detailed investigation\nof the qualitative angle and valuing of personal voices, see studies such as Schratz (1993),\nand more recently Walford (2001) and Schostak (2002), which include dealing with\ncompromise, problematics, subject and object.)\nIn answer to the first general question on the Performance\/Set Theory Curriculum\nQuestionnaire given out in the final session of the course, the 2001\u201302 Group B\/2\nrespondents (12\/15 questionnaire returns) were unanimous that instrumental connection\nmade academic study more interesting (see Figure 11). Reasons discussed included the\nfollowing: instrumental connection enabled two students to loosen their \u2018classical\u2019 bonds\nFig. 11 Performance\/set theory questions and responses for Group B\/2 (2001\u201302)\n269\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nDebo rah Mawer\nand explore less well-known twentieth-century music; for a keen singer, theory brought an\nadded dimension, whereas theory without practice would not have held much interest; for\nanother two students, it helped in understanding how things worked \u2013 in experimenting\non instruments it became apparent how easy or hard an idea was; and for a further four\nstudents, this form of study made the content more relevant, realistic and personal. Another\nstudent expressed honestly that they were more inclined to remember and learn from what\nthey had played. Perhaps the ultimate reason expressed was that: \u2018You can feel and be a\npart of what you study\u2019. This response nicely matched the educational rationale: seeking\nto promote motivation through participation, as active learning. \u2018Feel\u2019 suggests physical\nexperience but also, crucially, emotional investment; equally, it relates to the proprioceptive\nsynthesis discussed earlier.\nIn response to the second, more specifically directed, question about how interesting,\nor not, making connection with one\u2019s instrument was in the case of set theory, again all\nstudents considered that this made study more interesting. (Some two-thirds of Group B\/2\nclaimed that this enabled the study to be \u2018much more interesting\u2019, selecting the highest\nrating on the questionnaire.) The personal student-perceived advantages were as follows:\n\u0001 \u2018much more fun; more relevant; greater interaction with the issues and twentieth-\ncentury styles; makes a hard subject more approachable\u2019;\n\u0001 \u2018much less static than a \u201cnormal\u201d lecture\u2019;\n\u0001 \u2018puts emphasis [through genera] on hearing distinct sonorities (e.g. pentatonic,\nchromatic), making it easier to understand\u2019;\n\u0001 \u2018makes you more familiar with the notes of sets, telling them apart by character and\nrealising their potential\u2019;\n\u0001 \u2018allows exploration of other skills (e.g. improvisation), together with sounds and\nrepertoire not always used in [instrumental] lessons\u2019;\n\u0001 \u2018gets players away from the idea of perfection; allows people just to play, experiment\nand illustrate academic points\u2019;\n\u0001 \u2018involves the whole class; can help to build confidence when everyone has to do it;\nconversely, you experience it for yourself\u2019;\n\u0001 \u2018can only be an advantage because things can get repetitive when we\u2019re just writing\nstuff down all the time\u2019.\nTwo particularly insightful respondents commented that this teaching method afforded\nan \u2018opportunity to feel the dissonance rather than just to hear it\u2019 and that \u2018it helped me\nabsorb the theory by actually playing it (even more than just listening would)\u2019. Again, these\nresponses endorsed the roles of physicality and the experiential within the learning process.\nIn the interests of balance, the disadvantages of such teaching through performance\nwere also identified:\n\u0001 \u2018takes more time to cover the same amount of theory, but will probably remain\nan interesting topic [long-term investment view]; course length would need to be\nincreased, with more seminars\u2019;\n\u0001 \u2018works better with smaller numbers as everyone then gets a turn and no one can \u201chide\nin the corner\u201d\u2019 [possible resource implications];\n270\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nEn l i v en i ng ana l y s i s t h r ough pe r f o rmance\n\u0001 \u2018confidence can be an issue for a nervous player, especially improvising in front of\nthe group [but see also advantages above]; some students might decline to play\u2019\n[interestingly, this was not in fact an issue in practice];\n\u0001 \u2018some challenging rhythms to overcome in musical excerpts\u2019;\n\u0001 \u2018repertoire needs to be adapted for transposing instruments\u2019.\nWhen responding to this question, five students felt the need to make clear that they saw\nno major disadvantages.\nWhere question 3 was concerned, half of the students favoured adopting the \u2018Practising\nset theory\u2019 model as a new \u2018way in\u2019 (B), a minority remained predictably undecided\n(C), whilst a couple saw merit in combining the standard genera course (design 2)\nwith the practical version (A\/B), particularly endorsing \u2018Practising set theory\u2019 as a means\nof revision (\u2018a refresher course\u2019). Essentially, this \u2018third way\u2019 replicated the distinctive\nlearning experience of this student group, although it was not actually catered for in\nmy \u2018either\/or\u2019 framing of the question since my own stance had been to view this as a\ntransitional phase. I suppose this simply reinforces the familiar dictum that \u2018we like what we\nknow\u2019.\nFig. 12 Comparative responses to general questionnaire: Groups A\/2 (1999\u20132000) and\nB\/2 (2001\u201302)\nOverall course feedback for Group B\/2 (2001\u201302; 15\/15 general questionnaire returns)\nmay be compared with that for Group A\/2 (1999\u20132000; 25\/25 returns), as shown in\nFigure 12. Whilst both sets of returns are notably positive, \u2018Practising set theory\u2019, as the\nmost substantial variable, seems to have had an impact on perceptions of how interesting\nthe course was (Summary Statement 1), increasing levels from 84 per cent to 100 per\ncent, even though the proportion of students finding study \u2018very interesting\u2019 (i.e. 5, on a\n271\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nDebo rah Mawer\nscale 1\u20135) is in fact constant across the groups at 20 per cent. The perception of high levels\nof presentation remains constant at 100 per cent (Statement 2), but \u2018Practising set theory\u2019\nmay have impacted on the highest rating (down from 60 per cent to 50 per cent) since\nlecturer control is reduced with more spontaneous, less predictable classes(!) Responses to\nStatement 3, on course structuring, are again essentially constant and endorse the structure\nemployed. The reason for a declining response regarding the usefulness of learning package\nhandouts (Statement 4), with the highest rating down significantly from one academic\nsession to the next, is unclear. It may well be, however, that a larger class inevitably\nputs a high value on handouts, whereas the increased personal interaction possible in\na smaller class setting renders handout support less important. Nonetheless, the 2001\u2013\n02 cohort clearly felt satisfied with the general level of resourcing (Statement 5), which\nwas in fact increased from 1999\u20132000 as a direct corollary of \u2018Practising set theory\u2019.\nFinally, the perceived amount of student input necessary to complete the assignment\nincreased significantly from cohort A\/2 to B\/2; this probably relates both to the higher\nlevels of interest expressed (Statement 1) and to higher levels of achievement (recorded in\nFigure 13).\nFurther to the tabulated data in Figure 12, some student comments were relevant\nspecifically to the set-theoretic dimension. For 2001\u201302 (B\/2) returns, in response to\n\u2018What were the two best aspects of this course?\u2019, two students itemised \u2018playing set\ntheory\u2019, whilst another two identified \u2018the practical side, [which] encouraged confidence\u2019.\nSuch confidence- and esteem-building through focusing consistently on the positives of\nstudent endeavour are crucial to motivation and subsequent curricular success. (For more\non these connections, see again Hallam, 2001: 67.) Conversely, just to show that it is\nnot possible to win everyone over, in response to \u2018What were the two worst aspects\nof this course?\u2019, one student apologised for specifying \u2018set-theoretic analysis\u2019! On the\nother hand, that same respondent (together with at least one other) freely admitted\nthat they had gained a \u2018new way of looking at music\u2019. Other identified gains from the\ncourse as a whole included a \u2018wider knowledge of complementation and set theory\u2019\n(on the part of two students) and \u2018further understanding of how set theory can be\napplied to different composers\u2019. Given the perceptions of difficulty surrounding analysis\nin general and set theory in particular, it was gratifying that one student considered\nthe course \u2018very enjoyable\u2019, whilst another felt it was \u2018lots of fun, [and] seems more\nreal\u2019.\nA recording of typical class activity (in January 2002: class 3 out of 5) offered insights\ninto how students responded to being asked to improvise, together with a window on\ntheir general discussions and reactions. From the recording, it is apparent that the Group\nB\/2 students were generally enthusiastic and willing to try improvising phrases and then\nshort pieces. This group included a minority of students who were quite introverted and\nshy, and others who whilst much more extrovert were not necessarily always naturally\ncooperative. Predictably, the early, rather tentative, efforts at improvisation tended to stop\nabruptly, without fully realising the potential of a musical idea. Students needed particular\nencouragement to chart wider pitch registers and to maintain accurate and imaginative\nrhythmic identities. What is also clear from the recording, however, is that the class was\nwell engaged with these activities, that there were contributions (both performed and\nverbal) from the vast majority of the group, and that the atmosphere was supportive and\n272\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nEn l i v en i ng ana l y s i s t h r ough pe r f o rmance\ngood-humoured. These students did genuinely seem to enjoy learning through doing: the\nfun element had come into play, with spontaneous student banter that did not threaten the\nunderlying sense of purpose and commitment.\nLastly, in Figure 13, wemaymake assessment comparisons betweenGroupA\/2 (genera;\nno performance) and Group B\/2 (genera; with performance) that reveal the achievement\nlevel for the individual, written assignments of the second group to be dramatically higher\nthan for the first. Minority representation at third-class for Group A is replaced by a similar\nrepresentation at first-class for Group B; furthermore, the main \u2018clumping\u2019 of student\nachievement moves up a whole degree classification across the two cohorts, from 60\nper cent at 2\/2 to 67 per cent at 2\/1.\nFig. 13 Final tutor assessments for Groups A\/2 and B\/2 (1999\u20132002)\nClearly, in order to know whether this rise is wholly, or at least partially, attributable to\na different learning means, we need to examine the extraneous variables (as discussed in\nCohen & Manion, 1994: 170\u20132). Although internal levels of maturation were comparable\nand the teaching staff were unchanged, it is possible that, as an external variable, Group B\nwas of a generally higher ability than Group A; however, analysis of the overall degree\nresults of these two cohorts does not strongly support this: 58 per cent of Group B\nachieved a final 2\/1 degree classification as against 50 per cent of Group A. As already\nmentioned, a second, internal variable was that of class size, with Group A\/2 comprising\n25 students and Group B\/2 only 15 students, and it is likely that the higher staff\u2013student\nratio for Group B\/2 had some impact upon the higher levels of achievement. A further\nfactor to be borne in mind is that in some instances set theory might only account\nfor part of the final assessment, since additional analytical means could be included at\nthe students\u2019 choice. Whilst not downplaying these complicating factors, they do not in\nthemselves account convincingly for the full extent of the difference in assessment levels,\na significant element of which has, therefore, to be attributable to the alternative learning\nmeans.\nConc l u s i o n\nFrom the initial findings of \u2018Practising set theory\u2019 (and the previous \u2018Voice-leading for\nStrings\u2019), there seems much to be gained by seeking closer interplay within music\n273\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nDebo rah Mawer\ncurricula \u2013 at HE and other levels \u2013 between what are perceived as \u2018academic\u2019\ncomponents, especially analytical ones, and performance in the broadest sense: private\npractising, playing, improvising, ensemble work, and listening. The student response is\nquite consistent that, even at a third-year level of university study where only about half\nwere performance specialists (though all were of post-Grade 8 standard), foregrounding\nperformance is a powerful way of maximising student involvement \u2013 and, on current results,\nalso achievement \u2013 within a demanding academic curriculum. Such synthesis is also one\nway of encouraging closer contact and fruitful interaction between academic lecturers and\ninstrumental teaching staff.\nIt is striking to note the consistency of student approach in favouring a focus upon\ninstrumental learning, whether as a means or an end, across quite diverse educational\ncontexts and maturation levels: the reactions of the Lancaster University music students\nwere remarkably similar in measuring \u2018task value\u2019 to those found in recent instrumental\nresearch, where a high task value governed involvement in further creative activities\n(McPherson & McCormick, 1999), and where \u2018Doing well on my instrument is important\nto me\u2019 and, ultimately, \u2018Playing my instrument is my favourite activity\u2019 (McPherson &\nMcCormick, 2000).\nIf we return to the Music benchmark statement, there is still an implicit sense that,\nwhilst performers definitely need to assimilate appropriate academic knowledge and\nunderstanding, the opposite does not necessarily follow to the same extent. Obviously\nnot all musicians set out to be performers, but we may still be downplaying the degree to\nwhich the act of physical doing, of playing things out (whether or not as a performance\nspecialist), is a useful means to an analytical, or indeed historical, end. Certainly, there is\nmuch scope for development if students\u2019 experiences at Lancaster University are typical:\n\u2018It\u2019s good to connect academic study with practical performance as it\u2019s something that no\nother course really encourages, apart from composition.\u2019 Playing devil\u2019s advocate though,\none might argue that part of the attraction to the students who practised set theory was\nindeed the novelty of the means and that if performance were widely used as a tool in\nacademic lecture settings, part of the allure might be lost. On this one, only time will tell.\nWhatever the outcomes of that particular argument, as a result of consistently positive\nquestionnaires, productive class discussions and improved assessments, it is now intended\nto continue \u2018Practising set theory\u2019 as a third-year revision aid and also to embed these\npractical principles within the second-year music techniques course where set theory is\nfirst introduced (i.e. Group D\/1), from 2002\u201303. Finally, beyond its specifics, it is hoped\nthat the idea of \u2018Practising set theory\u2019 may serve as a possible model to other practitioners\nlooking for a way to popularise and provide an alternative \u2018take\u2019 on a subject area typically\nperceived by students as \u2018difficult\u2019 and in need of enlivening.\nAcknow l e dg emen t s\nThe music examples in the text are reproduced by permission of Boosey & Hawkes Music\nPublishers Ltd.
