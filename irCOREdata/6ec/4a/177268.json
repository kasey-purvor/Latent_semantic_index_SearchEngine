However,\nlittle is known about the impact that this has had in practice. This study explores Scottish primary care\nstaff's knowledge, attitudes and experiences associated with advising patients about physical activity during\nroutine consultations.\nMethods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey of general practitioners (or family physicians), practice\nnurses and health visitors based in four health regions was conducted during 2004. The main outcome\nmeasures included: (i) health professionals' knowledge of the current physical activity recommendations;\n(ii) practice related to routine physical activity advising; and (iii) associated attitudes.\nResults: Questionnaires were returned by 757 primary care staff (response rate 54%). Confidence and\nenthusiasm for giving advice was generally high, but knowledge of current physical activity\nrecommendations was low. In general, respondents indicated that they routinely discuss and advise\npatients about physical activity regardless of the presenting condition. Health visitors and practice nurses\nwere more likely than general practitioners to offer routine advice.\nLack of time and resources were more likely to be reported as barriers to routine advising by general\npractitioners than other professional groups. However, health visitors and practice nurses were also more\nlikely than general practitioners to believe that patients would follow their physical activity advice giving.\nConclusion: If primary health care staff are to be fully motivated and effective in encouraging and\nsupporting the general population to become more physically active, policymakers and health professionals\nneed to engage in efforts to: (1) improve knowledge of current physical activity recommendations and\npopulation trends amongst frontline primary care staff; and (2) consider the development of tools to\nsupport individual assessment and advice giving to suit individual circumstances. Despite the fact that this\nstudy found that system barriers to routine advising were less of a problem than other previous research\nhas indicated, this issue still remains a challenge.\nPublished: 23 May 2006\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:138 doi:10.1186\/1471-2458-6-138\nReceived: 25 January 2006\nAccepted: 23 May 2006\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/138\n\u00a9 2006 Douglas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:138 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/138Background\nThe benefits of regular physical activity (PA) include\nimproved physical and mental health, as well as an\nenhanced quality of life [1-3]. Yet, despite the generally\nhigh levels of awareness of the benefits of being active\nwithin the general population, there is continuing evi-\ndence of declining levels of PA both in England and Scot-\nland [4]. This trend has been strongly linked to increasing\nlevels of coronary heart disease, type II diabetes, oste-\noporosis, colon cancer and obesity. Currently, national\nrecommendations stipulate that adults should accumu-\nlate a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate level PA (the\nequivalent of brisk walking) most days of the week (30\nmins PA \u00d75) [5].\nWhilst it is recognised that policies recommending that\ngeneral practitioners (GPs) promote physical activity are\nnot universally accepted [6,7], many consider that pri-\nmary care (PC) health professionals are well placed to\nencourage both increased levels of PA within the general\npopulation, as well as with high-risk patients [8,9]. In\naddition, it has been reported that PA can alleviate the\nsymptoms of mental health illness, and that it has been\nfound that GPs have been generally reluctant to counsel\nthose patients suffering from mental health problems to\nconsider increasing their PA levels to ameliorate their con-\ndition [3].\nHealth professionals working in PC settings are consid-\nered an important part of a wider public health drive to\nencourage more people to become active [5]. A recently\npublished systematic review of the effectiveness of public\nhealth interventions aimed at increasing PA among appar-\nently healthy adults indicated that there is some evidence\nof short-term changes in PA levels than can be attributed\nto brief advice given by a health professional [10]. This\nwork also found that longer-term change may result if the\nindividual is referred to an exercise specialist in the com-\nmunity. In addition, there is some evidence to suggest that\nPC-based exercise referral schemes may result in short-\nterm impacts on PA levels for certain population groups,\nin particular the 'almost-active' [11].\nIn championing the role of PC in motivating and support-\ning the general population to become more physically\nactive, Taylor highlighted the need to understand the\nrange of multilevel and multi-sectoral factors (based on a\nwhole systems approach) that influence the effectiveness\nof any health promotion programme or intervention [9].\nBased on the PROCEED PRECEED health promotion\nplanning model [12] he argued that an investigation of\nthe PC consultation needed to include consideration of\nthree key dimensions including: (1) predisposing factors;\nwhich relate to attributes and characteristics of the\npatients; (2) reinforcing factors which the PHC staff mem-\nber brings to the consultation; and (3) enabling factors\nwhich relate the availability of resources, referrals, rules\nand protocols, and service structures.\nReinforcing factors in this context relate to the attitudes,\nknowledge, beliefs and behaviours of those professionals\nregarded as instrumental in motivating and supporting\npatients to become more physically active, and Taylor\nargued that there has been a lack of research in this area\n[9]. Steptoe et al. [13] also maintained that it is crucial to\nunderstand the beliefs and practice of those primary\nhealth professionals (working at the frontline) to fully\nappreciate and understand if public health policy changes\nhave been implemented effectively.\nTo date, there is a little Scottish empirical data available to\npolicy makers about such reinforcing factors [14]. The few\nstudies that have been conducted elsewhere found that\nGPs were more comfortable discussing PA with high-risk\ngroups, especially when linked to exercise prescription\nschemes [15]. Factors preventing routine PA advising\nincluded: lack of time; lack of financial reimbursement;\nrelevance to patient's presenting condition; perceptions of\npoor patient compliance; lack of confidence in providing\nadvice; insufficient knowledge about the benefits of exer-\ncise; and a lack of appropriate tools to assess and prescribe\nexercise [16-20]. Lack of self-efficacy associated with abil-\nity to motivate patients and achieve the desired outcome\nhas also been identified [21,22] as another barrier. Typi-\ncally, studies have failed to explore the views and practice\nof the range of health professionals groups within the\nsame study.\nAims and objectives\nOur study investigated attitudes, current practice and\nknowledge of Scottish PC staff related to advising patients\nabout PA during routine consultations. Staff groups\nincluded in this survey included GPs, health visitors (HV)\nand practice nurses (PN).\nMethods\nA questionnaire was developed following a review of the\nliterature, with selected questions taken from a previous\nstudy [18]. Four health board regions in Scotland, (from a\npossible 15) were selected for the study to reflect a cross\nsection of urban, remote and rural regions. Following a\npilot study, the questionnaire was mailed to all GPs (802)\nbased in all 180 practices in the four health board areas in\nScotland, as well as 317 PNs and 289 HVs. A mailing list\nfor all principal GPs in each of the four health regions was\nobtained from ISD (Information Services Division) Scot-\nland. The questionnaire was personally addressed to each\nGP and then generically to the PN and HV in each practice\n(no personalised mailing list was available for these pro-\nfessional groups). Reminders were posted after threePage 2 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:138 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/138weeks. Data was analysed using SPSS ver12.0. Chi-\nsquared tests were used to test for associations between\ncategorical data. Normally distributed continuous data\nwere analysed using were using t-tests. Ethical approval\nwas granted by the Scotland (A) Multiple Research Ethics\nCommittee.\nResults\nResponse rates\nQuestionnaires were returned by 757 (54%) of PC staff.\nThis included 376 (47%) GPs, 212 (67%) PNs and 169\n(59%) HVs. At least one GP in 80% of the PC practices\nreturned a completed questionnaire. The GP responders\nwere very similar to the national picture in terms of age,\nsex and qualifications [18].\nInformation provided by ISD Scotland about all GPs\nincluded in the study indicated that there were no signifi-\ncant differences between GP responders and non-\nresponders for age (t-test, p = 0.78) or gender (chi-square\ntest, p = 0.38). There were also no significant differences\nin the response rates from single-handed practices com-\npared to partnerships (chi-square, p = 0.75).\nKnowledge about current recommendations for sedentary \nadults\nOnly 13% of GPs (n = 49), 9% of HVs (n = 15) and 7% of\nPNs (n = 15) correctly described the current recommenda-\ntions (i.e. accumulation of 30 mins PA \u00d75 weekly, includ-\ning frequency, duration and intensity), while 18% of GPs\n(n = 68), 12% of HVs (n = 21) and 10% of PNs (n = 22)\nrecorded the previous recommendations (i.e. 20 mins \u00d7 3\/\nweek). However, approximately a third from each group\ncorrectly identified at least one component of the current\nrecommendations.\nPerceptions of PA levels within the general population\nWe found a significant difference in the opinions of PC\nstaff about levels of PA amongst the general population\nwithin Scotland. More PNs and HVs than GPs thought\noverall PA levels were increasing (Figure 1).\nAdvice given during consultations with adult patients who \nare apparently healthy\nThere were significant differences in respondents' advising\npractice both in terms of whether they discussed PA in the\nfirst place, and about the types of advice they gave. Over-\nall, PNs and HVs were more likely to say they gave all\ntypes of PA advice compared to GPs (Figure 2). For exam-\nple, 62% GPs indicated they were very likely or likely to\nrecommend all apparently health adult patients take\nmoderate exercise compared to 88% HVs and 90% PNs.\nHowever, the majority in all professional groups were all\nunlikely to recommend vigorous activity. An overwhelm-\ning majority recommended walking (85% \u2013 98%) as the\nmost popular form of exercise.\nAdvice given for specific medical conditions\nOverall GPs and PNs gave advice more often than HVs for\nmost medical conditions. PNs consistently \"always\" give\nadvice for every condition except for depression. Con-\nversely, four out of five HVs \"always or often\" give advice\nfor depression (almost as often as they gave advice to\noverweight patients). All PC staff were more likely to\n\"always\" provide PA advice for overweight patients than\nfor any other condition (Table 1).\nAttitudes associated with health promotion and PA \nadvising\nOverall, most respondents agreed that health promotion\nwas an important part of their work, and that promoting\nPA was a key part of PC. In addition, the majority of all PC\nstaff thought they had sufficient knowledge to advise on\nthe issue.\nGPs were more likely to agree that they advised patients\nabout PA only if it was linked to the presenting condition,\nwhile PNs and HVs were more likely to encourage most\npatients to increase their PA levels. Paradoxically, very few\nrespondents in each group agreed that they only discussed\nPA if the patient raised the issue (Table 2).\nPerceived barriers to giving routine PA advice to patients\nWhen asked to think about factors that prevent discussion\nof PA, GPs regarded lack of time as more of a barrier than\nPNs or HVs did, and more GPs (23%) than PNs (3%) or\nHVs (5%) indicated that a financial incentive might\nchange practice. However, 40 to 60% of all respondents\nagreed that educational materials are insufficient for their\nneeds, and approximately half thought there was a lack of\nspecific training available for health professionals, despite\nthe fact that they indicated they had sufficient knowledge\nto advise on PA (Table 3). Curiously, more GPs than PNs\nand HVs thought that patients were unlikely to be moti-\nvated to follow their advice (30.7% vs 13.8% vs 12.0%\nrespectively).\nDiscussion\nReinforcing factors\nKnowledge\nThe relatively low levels of knowledge and accuracy in\ndescribing the current PA guidelines were surprising, par-\nticularly given that the recommendations for sedentary\nadults are currently present in several national guidelines,\nsuch as, management of lipids and prevention of coronary\nheart disease, and diabetes management [23,24]. Further-\nmore, surprisingly high numbers of HVs and PNs thought\nthat levels of PA were increasing in the population. Most\nGPs believed the reverse was true. One can questionPage 3 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:138 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/138whether it is possible that this finding has arisen due to\nthe context within which the patient consultation occurs,\ni.e. where patients maybe more likely to disclose their PA\nexperiences in a less formal and time pressured atmos-\nphere. If this was the case, one might argue that GPs\nwould be less likely to hear patients' accounts of their\nattempts at PA behaviour, compared to PNs and HVs.\nHowever, this apparent lack of knowledge about PA rec-\nommendations and current population trends is concern-\ning, as, well-informed health professionals are considered\nessential for effective delivery of PC-based health promo-\ntion [25].\nAdvising practice\nMost PC staff said they currently advised patients about\nPA during routine consultations. However, there was var-\niation in practice between HVs and PNs on the one hand\nand GPs on the other. For example, HVs and PNs (~90%)\nwere more likely to intervene with advice than GPs\n(~70%). It is possible that this effect could be explained\nby the finding that also indicated that GPs were more\nlikely to discuss PA if they perceived it as relevant to a\npatient's presenting condition.\nAll PC groups were more likely to intervene with PA\nadvice if they thought the patient was overweight. Propor-\ntions of respondents who advised staff for other condi-\ntions was generally very low. These findings are consistent\nwith other studies [16,17]. However, HVs were more\nlikely to discuss PA with patients suffering from depres-\nsion and discuss psychological benefits than GPs or PNs.\nThis difference is interesting in light of the findings\nreported by the Mental Health Foundation, which also\nindicated that very few GPs considered providing advice\nabout exercise for those with mild to moderate depression\n[3].\nPrimary care staffs' perceptions of overall physical activity levels (%)Figure 1\nPrimary care staffs' perceptions of overall physical activity levels (%).

This is encouraging, as walking\nadvice is considered most relevant for those who are cur-\nrently sedentary, and\/or are from lower socio-economic\nbackgrounds; who also consistently report lower levels of\nPA [26].\nWhile it is reassuring to observe that PC staff appear to be\ngiving generally sound advice, for example, most were\nunlikely to advise patients to take vigorous PA \u2013 there\ncould be more clarity about the message given, particu-\nlarly as the correct advice currently exists in clinical guide-\nlines. However, the lack of use or adherence to clinical\nguidelines amongst GPs remains a challenge [27].\nAttitudes\nThe majority of study respondents expressed positive\nviews about health promotion as a core aspect of PC; with\n90% of all respondents indicating that they believed PA\npromotion in PC was important. In addition, the majority\nindicated they would discuss PA with their patients, even\nif it was not raised during the consultation. These findings\nindicate that there is good practitioner support for PA pro-\nmotion in PC.\nWhilst respondents had an apparent lack of knowledge\nabout the current guidelines, paradoxically, most thought\nthey had sufficient knowledge to promote PA with their\npatients. Perhaps these apparently contradictory findings\nindicate a general lack of awareness or understanding\nabout current behaviour change approaches to counsel-\nling. Nevertheless, it is important to raise awareness\namongst each professional group about current PA recom-\nmendations, preferably in the context of increased educa-\ntion and training opportunities, which study respondents\nalso indicated they needed.\nTopics likely to be covered during consultations with apparently healthy adult (%)Figure 2\nTopics likely to be covered during consultations with apparently healthy adult (%).

The fact that there are sig-\nnificant differences between GPs and nurses about this\nissue is perhaps not surprising given the different methods\nof remuneration for each group. Moreover, our findings\nsuggest that GPs were less likely to be motivated by finan-\ncial rewards than other studies have indicated [17].\nIn terms of other significant differences in study groups'\nviews, lack of time was considered more of a barrier to\nroutine PA advising for GPs than it was for PNs and HVs.\nHowever, only 50% of GPs thought lack of time was a bar-\nrier compared to 93% in a similar study [18]. It is possible\nthat this is a secular effect brought about by the changes in\nPC priorities over the last five years, which have witnessed\nan increased emphasis on health promotion and health\nimprovement.\nAnother perceived barrier worth highlighting is that GPs\nwere less likely to think that patients would be motivated\nto follow their advice compared to HVs and PNs. This may\nbe indicative of higher levels of self-efficacy related to\npatient motivation in the nurse groups compared to GPs.\nLow GP self-efficacy has also featured in other studies [20-\n28]. However, further study is needed to investigate why\nthis is the case, and if those who perceive themselves to be\nlikely to motivate patients to change their behaviour are\neffective in doing so.\nPredisposing and enabling factors\nThis study focussed on individual level or 'reinforcing fac-\ntors' [12] associated with PC professionals' attitudes and\nbeliefs associated with PA promotion. However, if PC is to\nbe effective in embedding policy within practice, other\ndimensions such as patient characteristics, so-called 'pre-\ndisposing factors' and, the system capability or 'enabling\nfactors' such as service structures, resources, protocols [29]\nneed to be considered.\nIt is essential to understand patients' perspectives, partic-\nularly about the relevance, acceptability and impact of PC\nstaff intervening with PA advice during routine consulta-\ntion. Some qualitative studies are starting to shed a little\nTable 1: Frequency in providing physical activity advice for specific medical conditions, n (%)\nAlways Often Occasionally Never p-value1\nOverweight\nGP 224 (60) 137 (37) 10 (3) 0 <0.001\nPN 165 (79) 43 (21) 2 (1) 0\nHV 90 (54) 54 (33) 22 (13) 0\nHypertension\nGP 154 (42) 173 (47) 43 (12) 1 (0.3) <0.001\nPN 144 (68) 60 (28) 7 (3) 0\nHV 51 (32) 51 (32) 43 (27) 15 (9)\nKnown ischaemic heart disease\nGP 137 (37) 191 (52) 43 (12) 0 <0.001\nPN 112 (53) 74 (35) 20 (10) 4 (2)\nHV 58 (35) 51 (31) 34 (21) 21 (13)\nDiabetes\nGP 131 (35) 166 (45) 68 (18) 6 (2) <0.001\nPN 140 (66) 51 (24) 19 (9) 1 (1)\nHV 31 (20) 39 (25) 60 (39) 25 (16)\nHypercholesteroleamia\nGP 96 (26) 157 (42) 108 (29) 9 (2) <0.001\nPN 113 (54) 73 (35) 23 (11) 1 (1)\nHV 46 (30) 40 (26) 45 (29) 25 (16)\nDepression\nGP 74 (20) 167 (45) 114 (31) 15 (4) <0.001\nPN 39 (19) 85 (41) 70 (34) 14 (7)\nHV 74 (44) 61 (36) 28 (17) 5 (3)\nNote: GP denotes General Practitioner, PN denotes Practice Nurse and HV denotes Health Visitor\n1 from Pearson \u03c72 testPage 6 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:138 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/138light on these issues. We know for instance that patients\nregard GPs as a credible source of advice, and some do\nseek their GP's help with gaining access to exercise referral\nschemes [30]. However, evidence suggests that these indi-\nviduals may be actively contemplating becoming more\nphysically active in the first place [11]. It may be possible\nthat other patient groups believe GPs have the necessary\nknowledge, but limited time in which to routinely advise\nthem on the issue, and are therefore not raising it during\na consultation with their doctor. Nevertheless, evidence\nabout patient's perspectives is scarce. Further patient-cen-\ntred research may also yield data about the validity (or\notherwise) of each of the respective professional group's\nviews about their efficacy in motivating patients to be\nmore physically active.\nOur findings concur with Eakin and colleagues [29] who\nfound in their review of physician barriers to PA counsel-\nling provision, that practitioner reports of system barriers\n(e.g. lack of time, resources, training and protocols or\nguidelines) continue to feature alongside individual level\nbarriers associated with PA promotion, such as not having\nthe requisite knowledge, skills, efficacy etc, needed to\nmotivate patients to change. They maintain that the devel-\nopment of PC based, PA interventions must therefore take\naccount of organisational systems and structures if such\ninitiatives can feasibly be adopted and implemented by\nbusy staff working in the real world. They and others\n[31,32] also highlight the need to develop tools and\nguidelines to support staff to promote PA. Our that\nrespondents believe that there is a lack of educational\ntools and training for staff to support individual practice,\nbut it was beyond the scope of the study to investigate\nsuch issues in detail and further work is required to iden-\ntify what is required.\nStrengths and limitations of the study\nThe survey achieved a reasonable response rate given the\ntiming of the survey, which coincided with the new GP\ncontract in the UK. Another study of GPs' beliefs and\nbehaviour related to health promotion gained a 48%\nresponse rate [13]. However, we also believe that this is\nthe largest survey of its kind of PC professionals from any\none health care system.\nTable 2: Primary care staff's opinions on promoting physical activity, n (%)\nStrongly \nagree\nAgree Neither agree \nnor disagree\nDisagree\/\nStrongly disagree\np-value1\nHealth promotion is an important part of primary care \nwork\nGP 158 (42) 191 (51) 24 (6) 3 (1) <0.001\nPN 163 (77) 46 (22) 2 (1) 0\nHV 155 (92) 14 (8) 0 0\nPromoting physical activity is important in primary care GP 135 (36) 211 (56) 26 (7) 4 (1) <0.001\nPN 138 (66) 68 (33) 2 (1) 1 (1)\nHV 131 (78) 37 (22) 0 0\nI only advise patients about physical activity if linked to their \npresenting problem\nGP 16 (4) 163 (43) 75 (20) 122 (33) <0.001\nPN 11 (5) 56 (27) 31 (15) 113 (53)\nHV 6 (4) 34 (20) 21 (13) 107 (64)\nI have sufficient knowledge to advise patients about physical \nactivity\nGP 44 (12) 204 (54) 94 (25) 34 (9) 0.02\nPN 19 (9) 130 (62) 42 (20) 19 (9)\nHV 29 (18) 103 (62) 25 (15) 9 (5)\nI try to encourage as many patients as possible to increase \ntheir physical activity\nGP 67 (18) 190 (51) 83 (22) 36 (10) <0.001\nPN 71 (34) 112 (53) 24 (11) 4 (2)\nHV 60 (36) 92 (55) 10 (6) 5 (3)\nI only discuss physical activity if the patient mentions it GP 1 (0.3) 20 (5) 46 (12) 308 (82) 0.17\nPN 2 (1) 5 (2) 18 (9) 185 (88)\nHV 0 4 (2) 18 (11) 146 (87)\nNote: GP denotes General Practitioner, PN denotes Practice Nurse and HV denotes Health Visitor\n1 from Pearson \u03c72 testPage 7 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:138 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/138It is possible that the generally very positive responses to\nquestions associated with the relevance of this issue\nwithin PC reflect the views of the \"enthusiasts\". However,\nthe demographic characteristics of our GP respondents are\nsimilar to the national picture, and the characteristics of\nthe GP non-responders were similar to the responders,\nsuggesting that our sample is representative.\nOur study was also limited to these particular study\ngroups for pragmatic reasons. Clearly there are other\nhealth professionals working in PC whose beliefs and\npractice related to this issue should also be understood.\nNevertheless this is the first study to our knowledge that\nhas attempted to capture a range of PC staff in the same\nsurvey on this issue.\nWhilst there are clearly some similarities between ours\nand others findings e.g. barriers to routine advising related\nto a perceived lack of time and relevance to the patient's\npresenting condition, there were differences related to the\nperceived role financial remuneration could play in\nencouraging routine PA advising amongst GPs. In addi-\ntion, other studies did not ask respondents about their\ncurrent knowledge and beliefs about current PA recom-\nmendations, or their perceptions about the general levels\nof PA in the population. We believe these factors may\nhave a bearing on whether staff will intervene with advice\n(or not) and the nature of the advice that is given.\nConclusion\nThe current state of respondents' knowledge related to the\nPA recommendations is of concern, particularly when\nmost respondents thought they had sufficient knowledge\nto promote this issue. However, study respondents also\nreported a lack of appropriate training and development\nopportunities for health professionals.\nAt the same time, the majority was supportive of PA pro-\nmotion as a core aspect of PC, indicating a positive foun-\ndation in which to develop further work in this area.\nHowever, there does not appear to be a pattern of system-\natic assessment and practice related to giving PA advice\nacross each study group. It is important that patients\nreceive clear and consistent messages about PA from the\nwide range of health professionals working within PC as a\nroutine aspect of healthcare. The development of tools\nand guidelines may assist staff to provide consistent, accu-\nrate and appropriate advice tailored to individual patient\nneeds. Training and development activities may also help\nto raise awareness about related issues. Financial remu-\nneration alone may not be a sufficient incentive to\nencourage more GPs to promote PA within their practice.\nIt was surprising to find that HVs and PNs were more\nlikely than GPs to report that they gave PA advice rou-\ntinely, while at the same time believing population levels\nof PA to be increasing. It is possible that small groups of\npatients are increasingly discussing the issue with their HV\nor PN, where time constraints appear to be less of an issue\nTable 3: Reasons given by primary care staff about why they do not give advice to patients about physical activity, n (%)\nStrongly \nagree\/agree\nNeither agree \nnor disagree\nDisagree\/\nstrongly disagree\np-value 1\nPatients are unlikely to be motivated to follow advice to be more active GP 115 (31) 78 (21) 81 (49) <0.001\nPN 29 (14) 46 (22) 135 (64)\nHV 20 (12) 30 (18) 116 (70)\nI don't have enough time to promote physical activity to my patients GP 181 (48) 65 (17) 128 (34) <0.001\nPN 44 (21) 27 (13) 139 (66)\nHV 16 (10) 20 (12) 129 (78)\nI would be more likely to promote physical activity if there was a \nfinancial incentive\nGP 85 (23) 80 (21) 208 (56) <0.001\nPN 7 (3) 26 (12) 177 (84)\nHV 7 (4) 10 (6) 149 (90)\nEducational materials for patients are insufficient GP 213 (57) 86 (23) 76 (20) <0.001\nPN 83 (39) 57 (27) 71 (33)\nHV 72 (43) 29 (18) 65 (39)\nPatients expect drug treatments when they visit their GP practice GP 141 (37) 85 (23) 149 (40) 0.067\nPN 67 (32) 64 (31) 79 (38)\nHV 73 (44) 41 (25) 53 (32)\nThere is a lack of available education for health professionals regarding \nphysical activity promotion\nGP 175 (47) 96 (26) 103 (28) 0.361\nPN 93 (46) 56 (27) 60 (29)\nHV 87 (52) 31 (19) 48 (29)\nNote: GP denotes General Practitioner, PN denotes Practice Nurse and HV denotes Health Visitor\n1 from Pearson \u03c72 testPage 8 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:138 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/138than for GPs, making it easier for patients to discuss their\nPA behaviour. However, it was beyond the scope of this\nstudy to explore these findings in detail, and it certainly\nrequires further investigation. It is particularly important\nto understand this issue more clearly when one also con-\nsiders the lower levels of knowledge about current PA rec-\nommendations, amongst the nursing groups, but their\ngenerally higher levels of support and enthusiasm for PA\npromotion compared to GPs. With the expanding public\nhealth role of nurses within PC, it seems there is even\nmore potential to reach a large proportion of the UK pop-\nulation. However as we stressed earlier, it is crucial that\nthe advice provided throughout is accurate, credible and\nconsistent.\nNursing groups in also appeared to believe they were\nmore likely to motivate patients to comply with their PA\nadvice than GPs. Why is GP self-efficacy about this issue\nlow and what can be done to enhance it? These are impor-\ntant questions for policy makers, which need to be consid-\nered seriously if the health improvement policy aspiration\nabout making PA promotion a routine aspect of primary\nhealth care can be realised. For, as evidence on the dynam-\nics of motivation suggests, those who do not expect posi-\ntive outcomes from engaging in certain behaviours have\nno motivation to invest in them [33].\nThis study was limited to an exploration of the beliefs,\nattitudes and practice of some of the health professional\ngroups who work in PC. It would be useful to have data\nabout other relevant groups not covered by this study, e.g.\ncommunity-based physiotherapists and district nurses,\ngiven their combined potential to reach an even larger sec-\ntion of the population with PA advice. Furthermore, this\nwork is based on self-reported behaviour. Future studies\nmight benefit from the inclusion of observational meth-\nods to validate claims of practice. In addition, in order to\nenhance the efficacy of PC-based approaches to PA pro-\nmotion there is also a need to investigate the role that pre-\ndisposing patient attitudes and beliefs, and, existing\nsystem or organisational capacity and mechanisms (e.g.\nprotocols and guidelines) plays.\nFinally, policymakers, respective professional bodies and\nhealth improvement agencies should consider addressing\nthese findings, nationally and locally, if public health pol-\nicy aims about fully engaging PC staff in efforts to encour-\nage and support the general population to be more\nphysically active are to be effective.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nFD was responsible for designing the study, interpreting\nthe findings and writing the paper.\nNT was responsible for data collection, analysis and inter-\npretation and writing the paper.\nEvT was responsible for designing the study, interpreting\nthe findings and writing the paper.\nSM was responsible for commissioning the study, and\ncontributed to the interpretation of the findings and writ-\ning the paper.\nAK was responsible for commissioning the study, contrib-\nuted to interpreting the findings and commenting on\ndrafts of this paper.\nAcknowledgements\nThis study was commissioned by NHS Health Scotland (formerly known as \nthe Health Education Board for Scotland).\nWe would like to thank Paul Fearn, Fiona Fulcher, and Mary Duncan for \ntheir research and secretarial support, and Fiona Spence with her help with \ndata entry.\nWe would also like to thank the reviewers of this article whose helpful \ncomments helped to shape this paper.\nFinally, we would like to thank the general practitioners, health visitors and \npractice nurses for agreeing to take part in this study.\nSome of the findings were presented at the Chief Scientist's Office 'Evidence, \nPolicy and Practice Conference' held at the Royal Society in Edinburgh on June \n18th, 2004.\nReferences\n1.
