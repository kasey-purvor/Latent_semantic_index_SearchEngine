A simple model of wound healing angiogenesis is presented, and investigated\nusing numerical and asymptotic techniques. The model captures many key qualitative fea-\ntures of the wound healing angiogenic response, such as the propagation of a structural unit\ninto the wound centre. A detailed perturbative study is pursued, and is shown to capture all\nfeatures of the model. This enables one to show that the level of the angiogenic response\npredicted by the model is governed to a good approximation by a small number of parameter\ngroupings. Further investigation leads to predictions concerning how one should select be-\ntween potential optimal means of stimulating cell proliferation in order to increase the level\nof the angiogenic response.\n1. Introduction and biological background\nCutaneous wound healing has developed in higher organisms over the course of\nevolution, resulting in complex mechanisms for the intricate control and orchestra-\ntion of cells, soluble factors and extra-cellular matrix following integument injury.\nThe outer layer of the skin, the epidermis, lies on a basal lamina covering the\ndermis, which is a matrix of collageneous fibres interwoven with blood vessels,\nlymphatic vessels and nerves, and contains numerous free cells, such as fibroblasts,\nlymphocytes and mast cells.\nDermal repair consists of three overlapping phases: inflammation, prolifera-\ntion and remodelling. The inflammatory phase encompasses blood clot formation\nand immune system response. Regeneration of the epidermis also begins during\nthis period, within hours after injury [3]. During the proliferative phase cells and\nintercellular substances increase greatly, accompanied by the migration of macro-\nphages, fibroblasts and blood capillaries across the wound bed. This migration is\nobserved to occur in a structural unit, often referred to as a wound module [16] or\nhealing unit [1], consisting of activated macrophages in the lead, followed by fibro-\nblasts, then by capillary tips and, finally, capillaries. The macrophages, recruited\ninto the hypoxic wound bed, release chemotactic agents, continually attracting the\nE.A.

Gaffney et al.\nfibroblasts and capillaries into the wound. The fibroblasts in turn produce an extra-\ncellular matrix which facilitates further cell migration into the wound and provides\nmechanical support for the new capillaries. The newly formed capillaries, in turn,\nsupply nutrients, enabling continued cellular function within the structural unit,\nwhich consequently migrates across the wound due to the mutual interaction of its\nconstituents [16]. The tissue formed in the wound as a result of the structural unit\u2019s\nmigration is capillary and cell rich, and referred to as granulation tissue.\nThe final phase, remodelling, involves wound contraction; the maturation of\nthe wound bed tissue, which gradually evolves from a highly cellular and vascular-\nised state to form scar tissue, with few cells and blood vessels; and the maturation\nof the extra-cellular matrix, resulting in higher tensile strength and a less random\norientation of the collageneous fibres.\nWe briefly note that this relatively elegant picture is in fact far from complete.\nMany other mechanisms are at work, as one has to expect from a real biological\nsystem. In addition to chemotaxis and hypoxia, numerous signals produced by the\nmacrophages and surrounding tissue influence the wound healing system. For ex-\nample growth and chemokinetic factors are also observed to be present [17] as is\nmacrophage secreted lactate, which upregulates fibroblast collagen synthesis [16].\nFurthermore, there is the possibility of numerous interactions between these various\nsignals; to illustrate, experiments have indicated that the production of macrophage\nfactors is controlled by oxygen levels [1]. To attempt to incorporate such detail is\ninappropriate in a modelling study, and hence below we focus on the fundamental,\nif basic, idea of a structural unit invading the wound bed, and even this framework\nis considered in a simplified form to facilitate modelling.\nOf central interest in this paper is the mechanism for new capillary formation, or\nangiogenesis, within the structural unit, and we proceed to describe this subprocess\nin detail. Consider the structure of a blood capillary near the wound edge. Aside\nfrom the blood constituents it carries, the capillary is a cylinder of endothelial cells,\nenveloped by a basement membrane. Angiogenesis begins with the degradation of\nthe basement membrane at localised sites which face the wound. This is followed\nby the migration of endothelial cells out of the vessel, aligning so as to form a\ntube, or \u201csprout\u201d, which extends from the parent vessel. Cells behind the newly\nformed \u201ccapillary tips\u201d proliferate, extending the sprouts further in the direction of\nthe wound. These tips can branch and eventually join up with other sprouts (anas-\ntomosis) to form a complete circuit through which blood can flow. The sprouting\nprocess begins again from these new vessels, until the wound space is permeated\nby a network of new capillaries (see Figure 1), covered first by a provisional layer\nand later a true basement membrane, both synthesized by the cells of the capillaries\n[3, pages 18\u201319].\nMany aspects, though certainly not all, of the picture of dermal wound heal-\ning described above have been the subject of modelling investigations, includ-\ning collagen fibre formation and orientation [4], and wound contraction [8]. In\nparticular, there are a number of models for dermal wound healing angiogenesis\n(DWHA) in the literature [2,10,13,14]. These works involve developing relative-\nly complex models, which are investigated primarily using numerical techniques\nwith the aim of firstly achieving agreement with experimental observation and,\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 339\nFig. 1. Sprout tips branch and join up to form a capillary network\nsecondly, acquiring insight into the important factors and parameters influencing\nDWHA.\nFor example Pettet et al. [14] develop a six variable model incorporating densi-\nties of capillary tips, blood vessels, fibroblasts, macrophage-derived chemoattrac-\ntants, oxygen and extracellular matrix, and it is shown that numerical simulations\nproduce results in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Other pa-\npers consider further simplified systems. Olsen et al. [10] consider a two variable\nmodel to investigate how the extracellular matrix density influences endothelial\ncell densities. Models incorporating capillary tips, blood vessels and macrophage-\nderived chemoattractants are considered in [2,13]. In the former paper, the beha-\nviour of front propagation speeds are compared to experimentally observed wound\nhealing speeds. In the latter paper, the numerics is supplemented with an analysis\ninvestigating bounds on both the travelling wavespeeds and healed blood vessel\ndensities.\nThe focus for this paper concerns a minimalist, but certainly non-trivial, model\nof DWHA phenomenology in terms of only two model constituents, namely den-\nsities of capillary tips and endothelial cells. We show that the model constructed in\nthis paper displays the qualitative features of the structural unit observed empirical-\nly. Straightforward estimates for wound healing speeds are deduced, as is perfectly\npossible with previous models. A key aspect of this model is that other features of\nthe model\u2019s structural unit are amenable to detailed analytical investigation. This is\nused to demonstrate the non-intuitive result that the maximum blood vessel density\nand the maximum density of \u201ccapillary tips\u201d (at least as predicated by the model)\ndepend on a very limited number of parameter groupings to a good approximation\nand such insight is confirmed numerically.\nOne may interpret maximal blood vessel densities as a measure of the system\u2019s\nangiogenic ability and its ability to supply nutrients to the wound healing structural\nunit. Consequently, the prediction that such ability should be regulated by a small\nnumber of parameters yields the possibility of substantial insight into what factors\n340 E.A. Gaffney et al.\nmay be responsible for angiogenesis, or its failure, within the structural unit. This\nis investigated leading to a novel modelling prediction of how one should select be-\ntween one of two potentially optimal means of increasing the system\u2019s angiogenic\nresponse.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows: in Section 2 the model is developed,\nwhile in Section 3 numerical travelling wave solutions are presented. In Section 4,\nwe investigate the model analytically using perturbation theory. Finally, in Sec-\ntion 5, the relevance, implications and future uses of the model and its associated\nresults are discussed.\n2. The model\nThe model will describe healing of a slit excisional wound which is much longer\nthan it is wide, and much wider than it is deep, in those parts of the wound far from\nthe corners. Thus one may consider a model with one spatial degree of freedom with\nreflection symmetry about a plane drawn parallel to the long edges of the wound\nand equidistant from both. As we are not explicitly considering the mechanisms\nof initial endothelial cell stimulation, we consider the dynamics only after a small\n(relative to the capillary tip carrying capacity) initial distribution of active sprout\ntips has formed at the wound edge. The averaged capillary tip and endothelial cell\n(i.e. blood capillary vessel building block) densities are respectively denoted by\nn(x, t) and b(x, t) at position x and time t . We choose x = 0 to denote the reflec-\ntion plane of symmetry described above. Note that for simplicity, the variable b\nrepresents both new and old capillaries.\n2.1. The capillary tip density equation\nFor the tip concentration n, we use the standard form of the conservation equation\n\u2202n\n\u2202t\n= \u2212\u2202J (n)\n\u2202x\n+ f (n, b), (1)\nwhere J (n) is the tip flux and f (n, b) describes the tip kinetics. We take the tip\nflux to be\nJ (n) = \u2212D1 \u2202n\n\u2202x\n\u2212D2n\u2202b\n\u2202x\n. (2)\nThis flux term captures the phenomenologically reasonable supposition that cap-\nillary tips migrate via a biased random walk with such bias, modelled by the\n\u2212D2n\u2202b\/\u2202x term, in the direction of decreasing blood vessel density.\nWe briefly note this term replaces the bias of capillary tips in previous models;\nfor example, it replaces the chemotactic bias in [13] and the haptotactic bias in [10]\n(though the model in this article has no analogue of the haptokinesis considered\n[10]). One can compare the contribution to the capillary tip flux from chemotaxis\nin [13], to the term \u2212D2n\u2202b\/\u2202x as predicted by their model, and observe that\nthey have the same qualitative features for a travelling wave solution, exhibiting\npeaks within the front of the travelling wave. See, for example, figures 2(a), 2(b)\nand (5) in [13]. Analogous comments apply on comparing the haptotatic flux and\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 341\nFig. 2. An initial simulation, at 23 days, of the model with parameters given in Table 1\nshowing the development of a wave-like profile, possessing a \u2018structural unit\u2019. To distin-\nguish between the capillary tip density and the endothelial cell density in this figure, note\nthat the capillary tip density is (essentially) zero for large x, whereas the blood vessel density\nis unity. This applies for all similar figures below\n\u2212D2n\u2202b\/\u2202x in [10]. This, along with relative simplicity, provides the motivation\nfor considering the \u2212D2n\u2202b\/\u2202x term as a model for bias in the capillary tip flux.\nWe take the tip kinetics to be\nf (n, b) = \u03bb2n\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\ntip branching\n\u2212 \u03bb3n2\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\ntip-tip anastomosis\n\u2212 \u03bb4nb\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\ntip-sprout anastomosis\n. (3)\nThe term \u03bb2n describes the splitting of a tip into two separate branches; it is as-\nsumed that in a given length of time, a fixed proportion of existing sprouts will\nbranch, while the term\u2212\u03bb3n2 describes the joining of two tips to create a complete\ncircuit, and \u2212\u03bb4nb describes the joining of a tip to the side of a capillary, produc-\ning a complete circuit. Note that such terms for modelling branching anastomosis\nwere first used by Edelstein in a model of fungal growth [20], and have since been\napplied on numerous occasions in modelling angiogenesis [13,19].\n2.2. The endothelial cell density equation\nWe assume that the capillary sprouts are not capable of independent movement,\nbut instead that their movement is determined by the fact that they passively follow\n342 E.A. Gaffney et al.\ntheir leading tip. This yields proportionality between the flux of the capillary tips\nand the contribution to the endothelial cell flux arising from the invasion of the\ncapillary tips into the wound bed. Thus we have that the flux of the endothelial cell\ndensity is given by\n\u2212\u03bb5\n(\nD1\n\u2202n\n\u2202x\n+D2n\u2202b\n\u2202x\n)\n(4)\nwhere \u03bb5 is the (average) number of endothelial cells in a capillary tip.\nThe kinetics of the endothelial cells are phenomologically modelled by\ng(n, b) \u2261 \u03bb6\u03bdb (b0 \u2212 b)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nordinary logistic remodelling\n+ \u03bb6\u03c7nb(b1 \u2212 b)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\ntip-modulated logistic growth\n+ \u03bb5(\u03bb3n2 + \u03bb4nb)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nendothelial cells from the capillary tip compartment\n.\nThis models three processes. The first, ordinary logistic remodelling, describes\nthe proliferation of endothelial cells under standard conditions. This process has\na carrying capacity of b0, and takes place at a rate characterised by \u03bd. During an-\ngiogenesis a different contribution to the kinetics, occurring on a faster timescale,\nis observed in the immediate vicinity of a capillary tip [2, 4]. This is captured\nphenomenologically in the second term which possesses a characteristic rate pro-\nportional to the capillary tip density, n and a carrying capacity of b1. The fact this\nprocess proceeds at a faster rate entails that nmax\u03c7 \u0006 \u03bd, as discussed further in Ap-\npendix (A.2), where parameter estimation is detailed. The third process describes\nthe contribution to the endothelial cell density kinetics arising from anastomosis\n(see equation (3)). Finally, note that the ordinary logistic modelling term cannot be\nsimply ignored as one may readily anticipate regions of the spatial domain where\n\u03c7n\u0007 \u03bd.\n2.3. Initial and boundary conditions\nWe suppose that initially there are neither capillaries nor tips in the wound space,\nand that the capillary density outside the wound is at the normal unwounded level,\nb0. We assume an initial perturbation of capillary tip density which lies in a band\nof width \u03c2 at the wound edge and is small (compared to the characteristic scale of\nthe carrying capacity for the capillary tip kinetics). The equations are to be solved\non the domain x \u2208 [0,\u221e), where x = 0 is the wound centre and x = x0 the wound\nedge. The initial conditions are\nn(x, 0) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f30 x \u2208 [0, x0),ninit x \u2208 [x0, x0 + \u03c2 ],0 x \u2208 (x0 + \u03c2,\u221e),\nb(x, 0) =\n{\n0 x \u2208 [0, x0),\nb0 x \u2208 [x0,\u221e); (5)\nthough in numerical simulations we smooth the edges of these step-function-type\nconditions.\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 343\nFor the boundary conditions, we have that far from the wound, at x = \u221e, the\nvessel density remains that of the normal unwounded dermis and the tip density is\nzero. Also, as the wound is symmetric about its centre, we can apply the symmetric\nboundary condition at x = 0, and hence\nn(\u221e, t) = 0, b(\u221e, t) = b0, (6)\n\u2202n\n\u2202x\n(0, t) = \u2202b\n\u2202x\n(0, t) = 0.

Taking\nk4 > k2, as motivated in Appendix (A.2), there are three non-negative steady-states\ngiven by\n(n, b) = (0, 0), (0, 1), (k2\nk3\n= 1, 0).\nThe first of these corresponds to the wounded steady-state. The second is the un-\nwounded steady-state and the third is a biologically irrelevant state consisting of\ncapillary tips and no blood vessels. One can readily deduce that, on an infinite\ndomain with Neumann conditions, and subject to spatially homogeneous pertur-\nbations that the steady-state (n, b) = (0, 1) is stable, whereas the steady-states\n(n, b) = (0, 0), ( k2\nk3\n= 1, 0) are both unstable, as one would intuitively expect.\n3. Initial simulations\nThe numerical method used is discussed inAppendix B, while parameter estimation\nis discussed in detail in Appendix A.2, and is summarised in Table 1.\nTable 1. Reference parameter set. Note that we fix k3 = k2. This, together with all aspects\nof parameter estimation, is detailed in Appendix A.2.\nC1 = 3.5\u00d7 10\u22124 k2 = 0.83 \u03b2 = 9.29\nC2 = 3.5\u00d7 10\u22124 k3 = 0.83 \u03c7 = 0.3\nk4 = 0.85 \u03bd = 2.5\u00d7 10\u22123 ninit = 0.25\nk5 = 0.25 \u03c2 = 0.25 \u03b21 = 10.0\n3.1. Initial simulations and observations\nThe simulation in Figure 2 shows the development of a wave-like profile progress-\ning towards the centre of the wound. Note that the solution has the qualitative\nfeatures empirically observed in cutaneous wound healing. It exhibits a \u2018structural\nunit\u2019, whereby a unit consisting of a peak in the capillary tips, closely followed\nby a peak in blood vessel density, move in concert towards the wound centre; it\nalso exhibits elevated blood vessel density throughout the wounded region, as one\nwould expect with the formation of granulation tissue in the wound.\nNote that in Figure 2 there is a secondary peak in the endothelial cell density\nb near x = 1 which arose during the transitory period, before the development of\nthe front of the wave profile. Its persistence is due to the fact that a travelling wave\nhas not yet developed on the domain. Indeed, the secondary peak in the tail of the\nendothelial cell density, b, is not translated as time increases, as can be seen by\ncomparing Figures 2 and 3.\nOne can understand why travelling waves do not develop given the assumption\nthat n\u2192 0 much faster than b\u2192 1 for relatively large x, as the solution approaches\nthe unwounded steady state (n, b) = (0, 1). Such an assumption is consistent with\nFigures 2 and 3. To presume otherwise would be biologically counter-intuitive,\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 345\nFig. 3. An initial simulation, at 20 days, of the model with parameters given in Table 1.\nComparison with Figure 2 clearly shows that a travelling wave does not develop, in that the\nprofile of the endothelial cell density (i.e. the profile which is essentially unity for large x)\nis not simply translated with increasing time\nin that we anticipate there should be a significant density of capillary tips only\nat, or near, the edge of the invading structural unit, but a raised concentration of\nblood vessels in the forming granulation tissue at, and behind, the invading struc-\ntural unit. With this assumption, we consider the endothelial cell density equation,\ntransformed into travelling wave coordinates. Thus we have\nk5C1N\u02c6\n\u2032\u2032 + k5C2(N\u02c6B\u02c6 \u2032)\u2032 \u2212 cB\u02c6 \u2032 + g(N\u02c6, B\u02c6) = 0; (16)\nwhere z = x + ct , with c > 0 the travelling wave speed, \u2032 denotes d\/dz and\nN\u02c6(z) = n(x, t), B\u02c6(z) = b(x, t). On linearising this equation about the unwounded\nsteady state (n, b) = (0, 1), with the above assumption, |b\u22121| = |B\u02c6\u22121| \u0007 n = N\u02c6 ,\none can readily show that B\u02c6 = 1 + Ee\u2212\u03bdz\/c where E is a constant of integration.\nThus, the (non-dimensionalised) characteristic lengthscale of the decay for the en-\ndothelial cell density tail on approaching the unwounded steady state (n, b) = (0, 1)\nfor large z is given by c\/\u03bd \u223c 400c, while the non-dimensionalised wound domain\noccupies the unit interval. Consequently, providing the characteristic speed of the\nwave is sufficiently large (we find later 400c \u223c O(10)), the tail of the travelling\nwave never forms on a biologically realistic domain size, as the travelling wave tail\ndecays on a much larger spatial scale than the scale of a realistic domain.\n346 E.A. Gaffney et al.\nThis can be confirmed by seeing if a travelling wave type solution forms if \u03bd\nis increased (even if such an increase is not biologically realistic). The resulting\n(n, b) profile has been plotted in Figure 4, and a much steeper b tail is exhib-\nited. This profile is further observed to be that of a travelling wave (to an ex-\ncellent approximation), whereby it is simply translated with increasing time (not\nshown).\nEven when travelling wave solutions are not seen in wound healing models,\nowing to the fact that the realistic domain size is too small to allow them to develop\nfrom the initial conditions, features of the travelling wave solutions can prove to\nbe useful approximations for many features of the wave-like solutions of the full\npartial differential equations (see e.g. [11,12]). Thus, we will examine the travelling\nwaves associated with this system, deriving estimates for the speed of the \u2018structural\nunit\u2019, i.e. the concentration of capillary tips and blood vessels, and approximations\nfor the peak densities of capillary tips and blood vessels. We will proceed to verify\nthat such approximations hold for the solutions to the partial differential equations\nto a good approximation for numerous variations in the model parameters, which\nwill greatly facilitate further investigation.\nFig. 4. Here the parameters are as given in Table 1, except that \u03bd has been increased to 0.25.\nNote that the endothelial cell density tail decays to its asymptotic value of unity. One may\nfurther observe from the numerics that the resulting (n, b) profile evolves to a travelling\nwave (to an excellent approximation), whereby the above profile is simply translated (not\nshown)\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 347\n4. Detailed travelling wave analysis\n4.1. Travelling wave speed of the structural unit\nConsider the travelling wave coordinate z = x + ct , where c > 0 is the wave\nspeed, and the travelling wave variables N\u02c6(z) = n(x, t), B\u02c6(z) = b(x, t). The\nmodel equations become\nC1N\u02c6\n\u2032\u2032 + C2(N\u02c6B\u02c6 \u2032)\u2032 \u2212 cN\u02c6 \u2032 + f (N\u02c6, B\u02c6) = 0, (17)\nk5C1N\u02c6\n\u2032\u2032 + k5C2(N\u02c6B\u02c6 \u2032)\u2032 \u2212 cB\u02c6 \u2032 + g(N\u02c6, B\u02c6) = 0; (18)\nwhere the prime denotes d\/dz. Far behind the wave is unwounded dermis and far\nahead of the wave is the unhealed wound, so the boundary conditions are B\u02c6(\u221e) = 1,\nB\u02c6(\u2212\u221e) = 0, N\u02c6(\u221e) = 0, N\u02c6(\u2212\u221e) = 0.\nA standard investigation of the eigenvalues at the steady states (N\u02c6, B\u02c6) = (0, 0)\nyields a minimum wave speed, given by\nc2 \u2265 4C1k2. (19)\nNote that, on assuming a spatially infinite domain, the model\u2019s initial conditions are\npositive semi-definite for both n and b, the initial conditions for n are of compact\nsupport and finally that the initial conditions for b satisfy b = 0 for all x < K for\nsome finite K . Given such constraints on initial conditions, we hypothesise that the\nminimum wavespeed of the travelling wave yields a good estimate for the speed\nof propagation of the structural unit (i.e. the capillary tip peak and endothelial cell\nfront) observed in Figures 3 and 4. Rigorous proofs of analogous hypotheses are\nwell-known for scalar equations, but are typically lacking for systems of equations,\nespecially those exhibiting non-monotonicity. However, our above hypothesis is\ncompletely consistent with all our numerical observations on the behaviour of this\nmodel. For example, one can compare Figures 2 and 3 to see that the wave pro-\nfile has propagated a non-dimensionalised distance of approximately 0.1 (more\naccurately 0.105) in three time units (days), giving a non-dimensionalised speed\nof 0.035, whereas\n\u221a\n4C1k2 = 0.040. The discrepancy between the observed speed\nand the minimum travelling wave speed is relatively small and arises due to the fact\nthe wave front is still evolving to its attractor on the biological domain. We briefly\nnote that this discrepancy has been observed to tend to zero at large times on a\nbiologically unrealistic, extended, wound bed. Such observations are well-known\nand frequently made for the form of reaction diffusion systems commonly used in\nwound healing modelling [11,12]. Thus we have, as is standard, the observation\nthat the propagation speed of the structural unit is accurately approximated by a\nsingle parameter grouping.\n4.2. Asymptotic investigation of the structural unit\nWe proceed to study the travelling wave equations in more detail. Since the model\nhas more than one small parameter, the variables are rescaled and new parameter\ngroupings defined in order to express the equations in terms of only one explicit\n348 E.A. Gaffney et al.\nsmall parameter, $. The equations are subsequently investigated via an expansion\nin $, with the aim of extracting analytical information concerning the structural\nunit. In particular, we focus on the maxima of the endothelial cell density within\nthe structural unit, as this represents a measure of the system\u2019s angiogenic ability.\nIn the following we have three distinct asymptotic regions which are matched (or\nrather \u201cpatched\u201d) at two distinct points. We subsequently determine the approx-\nimation for the endothelial cell density maximum in terms of model parameters,\nand illustrate the correlation between our analytic predictions, and the numerical\nmodel.\nA convenient rescaling of the non-dimensionalised PDE model is\n\u03c4 = k2t, y =\n\u221a\nk2\nC1\nx, n\u02c6 = k3\nk2\nn (20)\nwhich gives (on dropping the hat for convenience)\n\u2202n\n\u2202\u03c4\n= \u2202\n2n\n\u2202y2\n+ C2\nC1\n\u2202\n\u2202y\n[\nn\n\u2202b\n\u2202y\n]\n+ (n\u2212 n2)\u2212 k4\nk2\nnb,\n\u2202b\n\u2202\u03c4\n= k5\n(\n\u22022n\n\u2202y2\n+ C2\nC1\n\u2202\n\u2202y\n[\nn\n\u2202b\n\u2202y\n])\n+\n(\n\u03c7\u03b21\nk3\nn+ \u03bd\nk2\n)\nb \u2212\n(\n\u03c7\nk3\nn+ \u03bd\nk2\n)\nb2\n+ k5k2\nk3\nn2.\nSome of the coefficients of the above terms are of order 1, so we define O(1)\nparameters as follows:\n\u03c11 = C2\nC1\n\u223c O(1), \u03c12 = k4\nk2\n\u223c O(1), \u03c13 = \u03c7\nk3\n\u223c O(1).\nWe now transform to travelling wave coordinate\nz = y + c\u03c4,\nwith the variables\nN(z) = n(y, \u03c4 ), B(z) = b(y, \u03c4 ).\nThe equations become\nd2N\ndz2\n+ \u03c11 d\ndz\n[\nN\ndB\ndz\n]\n\u2212 cdN\ndz\n+ (N \u2212N2)\u2212 \u03c12 N B = 0,\n(\nd2N\ndz2\n+ \u03c11 d\ndz\n[\nN\ndB\ndz\n])\n+ \u03c11N dB\ndz\n\u2212 cdB\ndz\n+\n(\nB\u03b21\u03c13N + \u03bd\nk2\n)\nB\n\u2212\n(\n\u03c13N + \u03bd\nk2\n)\nB\n2 + k5k2\nk3\nN\n2 = 0,\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 349\nwith the travelling wave boundary conditions\nB(\u221e) = 1, B(\u2212\u221e) = 0, N(\u221e) = 0, N(\u2212\u221e) = 0. (21)\nNote that the original travelling wave coordinate was\nz = x + ct =\n\u221a\nC1\nk2\ny + c\nk2\n\u03c4 =\n\u221a\nC1\nk2\n(\ny + c\u221a\nC1k2\n\u03c4\n)\n.\nSo if we set c = c\u221a\nC1k2\nwe have z =\n\u221a\nC1\nk2\nz. The theoretical minimum of c is\u221a\n4C1k2, hence\nc \u2265 2,\nso we can use c to define a small parameter\n$ = 1\nc2\n\u2264 1\n4\n. (22)\nGiven the above observations that the front of the structural unit attains the mini-\nmum travelling wave speed, we hypothesise that the trajectory in phase space which\nactually corresponds to the PDE model attractor is the one of minimum travelling\nwavespeed for non-negative solutions. Thus below we take\nc = 2, $ = 1\n4\n.\nFor convenience, we define the O(1) parameter, \u03c14 by\n\u03c14 = \u03bd\nk2\n$\u22124 (23)\n4.3. Inner and outer solutions\nConsider a general rescaling based on $:\n\u03be\u03c3 = $\u03c3+ 12 z, N(z) = N(\u03be), B(z) = B(\u03be),\nwhere \u03c3 will be chosen to give the appropriate scaling. The only value of \u03c3 which\nwill allow us to match algebraic terms with a derivative, as required for nontrivial\nbehaviour, is \u03c3 = 0.

This is denoted matching point 1. Similarly the right hand dashed line\nindicates the approximate position of the second matching point, which is denoted matching\npoint 2\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 351\nHowever, as motivated in Appendix A.2, k5\/(\u03c13\u03b21)\u0007 1 may be treated as asymp-\ntotically small. Thus, we have, at leading order, the approximation\ndB0\nd\u03be0\n= N0\u03c13\u03b21\n(\n1\u2212 B0\n\u03b21\n)\nB0. (28)\nDividing equation (26) by equation (28), and integrating, we have\nN0 =\n(\n\u03b21 \u2212 B0\nB0\n) 1\n\u03c13\u03b21 [D +H(d,B0)] (29)\nwhere\nH(a, b) =\n\u222b b\na\n1\u2212 \u03c12B \u2032\n\u03c13\u03b21B \u2032\n(\n1\u2212 B \u2032\n\u03b21\n) ( B \u2032\n\u03b21 \u2212 B \u2032\n) 1\n\u03c13\u03b21\ndB \u2032 (30)\nand D, d are constants related by whatever choice is made for the lower limit, d,\nof the integration.\n4.3.2. Outer waveback solution\nWe now consider the outer solution in the waveback. Note that essentially when we\nignored terms of O($) in the inner solution, we were assuming that the \u03c14$4 terms\nin (25) were dominated by the \u03c13\u03b21N and \u03c13N terms. This will not be the case in\nthe outer waveback region, as we require N \u2192 0 as \u03be0 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. Thus we assume\nthat N is of order not more than $4, and so try a perturbation expansion of the form\nN = $4N0 + $5N1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\nB = B0 + $B1 + $2B2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\nSubstituting into equation (24) and (25) gives, at leading order,\ndN0\nd\u03be0\n= N0[1\u2212 \u03c12B0],\ndB0\nd\u03be0\n= \u03c14$4B0(1\u2212 B0). (31)\nThe term of order $4 is retained in the latter equation, as required for consisten-\ncy with the boundary conditions. (No appropriate scaling will remove the $4, and\nwithout the term\u2019s retention one would quickly come across inconsistencies (see\nbelow)). Dividing and integrating,\nN0 = KB\n1\n\u03c14$4\n0 |1\u2212 B0|\n\u03c12\u22121\n\u03c14$4 , (32)\nwhere K is a constant.\n352 E.A. Gaffney et al.\n4.3.3. Outer wavefront solution\nAnalogously to the waveback, we take it that N is not of order more than than $4\nin the wavefront, as the boundary of the wavefront and inner region is similarly\ndetermined according to whether the \u03c14$4 terms in (25) dominate the \u03c13\u03b21N and\n\u03c13N terms. We also assume in the wavefront that B is small. Thus we consider an\nexpansion of the form\nN = $4N0 + $5N1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (33)\nB = $\u00b5\n(\nB0 + $B1 + $2B2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n)\n, \u00b5 > 0. (34)\nUse of the expansion (34) in equation (25) only gives a nontrivial leading order\nperturbative approximation for \u00b5 = 5, whereupon\nB \u20320 = k5N \u2032\u20320 (1+O($4B0, $4B \u20320, $4B \u2032\u20320 )) (35)\nNote that we do not expect any boundary layers in the wavefront, i.e. we do not ex-\npect to have to rescale \u03be0 due to large gradients in N0 or B0, and hence one does not\nhave to apply matched asymptotic techniques to correctly incorporate higher order\nderivatives in a perturbative expansion of the wavefront equations. Thus the higher\norder terms in (35) are neglected, and one can deduce B0 = k5N \u20320(1 + O($4)),\nwith the constant of integration determined by boundary conditions as \u03be0 \u2192\u2212\u221e.\nSubstituting the expansion (33) into equation (24) yields N \u20320 = N0(1 + O($)).\nHence in the waveback at leading order we have\nB0 = k5N0(1+O($)). (36)\n4.4. Solution matching\nFor notational simplicity below, we denote the leading order approximation to N\nand B by the same symbols.\nWe will match when the \u03c14$4 terms in equation (25) are the same size as the \u03c13\u03b21N\nand \u03c13N terms. So at each matching point, |\u03c13\u03b21NB \u2212 \u03c13NB2| = |\u03c14$4B \u2212\n\u03c14$4B2|, i.e.\n|\u03c13N(\u03b21 \u2212 B)| = |\u03c14$4(1\u2212 B)|. (37)\nWe need to match at two points, as described in Figure (5). Let N(1), B(1) be the\nvalues of N and B at the matching point between the inner region and the outer\nwavefront region, i.e. matching point 1 of Figure (5). Similarly, letN(2),B(2) denote\nthe values of N and B at the matching point between the inner region and the outer\nwaveback, i.e. matching point 2 of Figure (5).\nAt the first matching point, B(1) < 1 and thus (36), (37) give\nB(1) = k5$N(1)(1+O($)) (38)\n\u03c13N(1)(\u03b21 \u2212 B(1)) = \u03c14$4(1\u2212 B(1)) . (39)\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 353\nThe appearance of the factor of $ in relation (38) arises due to the different scalings\nof B0 and N0 in the wavefront. Taking d = B(1) in equation (29) gives\nN(1) = D\n(\n\u03b21 \u2212 B(1)\nB(1)\n) 1\n\u03c13\u03b21\n. (40)\nNow consider the second matching point. Equation (28) shows that the only\nturning point of B = B0 in the inner region for N0 \u0015= 0 is B = B0 = \u03b21. However,\nall numerical simulations suggest that bmax < \u03b21. Similarly, equation (31) for dB0d\u03be\nin the outer waveback region shows that the only turning point of B = B0 in the\nwaveback for N0 \u0015= 0 is B = B0 = 1; however, all numerical simulations suggest\nthat bmax > 1. Hence as we approach the matching point from below,Binner increas-\nes towards \u03b21, and as we increase \u03be0 to pass beyond the matching point, Bwaveback\ndecreases towards 1. So B(2) is actually the maximum value of B in our matched\nsolution. Thus if we can findB(2) in terms of the parameters, we should have a good\napproximation to the value of bmax. Thus, we explicitly anticipate that B = B0 is\nnot constant in the outer waveback, and thus one must maintain the O($4) term in\nequation (31) for the outer waveback.\nAs we expect 1 < B(2) < \u03b21 equations (32) and (37) give\nN(2) = $4KB\n1\n\u03c14$4\n(2) (B(2) \u2212 1)\n\u03c12\u22121\n\u03c14$4 ,\n\u03c13N(2)(\u03b21 \u2212 B(2)) = \u03c14$4(B(2) \u2212 1), (41)\nwhile (29) implies\nN(2) =\n(\n\u03b21 \u2212 B(2)\nB(2)\n) 1\n\u03c13\u03b21 [\nD +H(B(1), B(2))\n]\n. (42)\nNote that we have six unknowns (N(1),N(2),B(1),B(2),K andD) and six equa-\ntions. Thus, one can in principle solve to determine N = N(B), and integrate to\nfind N(\u03be0), B(\u03be0). However, in practice, even analytically solving for (N(1), N(2),\nB(1), B(2), K and D) is too cumbersome to perform. One can make a number of\nimportant observations by considering the expressions for (B(1), N(1), D), without\nsolving for (B(2), N(2), K). For future reference, we note that equations (39) and\n(40) can be readily solved to give\nB(1) = k5\u03c14\n\u03c13\u03b21\n$5(1+O($)), N(1) = \u03c14\n\u03c13\u03b21\n$4(1+O($5)),\nD = \u03c14\n\u03c13\u03b21\n$4\n(\nk5\u03c14\n\u03c13\u03b221\n$5\n) 1\n\u03c13\u03b21\n(\n1+O\n(\n$\n\u03c13\u03b21\n))\n.

Analytical approach\nIn this section we use the above asymptotic framework to determine the maximum\nvalue of the capillary tip density, and we will proceed to verify this numerically for\na number of parameter variations.\nSince the inner equations (26), (28) are valid in the region where the capillary\ntip density is largest, and as N = N0, B = B0 in the inner region, the maximum\nvalue attained by N occurs when N = 1\u2212 \u03c12B. Hence\nNmax = 1\u2212 \u03c12B(Nmax). (44)\nWe now seek B(Nmax); Nmax itself can then easily be determined from (44). For\nsimplicity of notation, we define\nB\u2217 = B(Nmax).\nFrom equation (29), we have an expression for N(B) = N0(B0), and hence\n1\u2212 \u03c12B\u2217 =\n(\n\u03b21 \u2212 B\u2217\nB\u2217\n) 1\n\u03c13\u03b21 [\nD +H(B(1), B\u2217)\n]\n=\n(\n\u03b21 \u2212 B\u2217\nB\u2217\n) 1\n\u03c13\u03b21 [\nO($4)+H(B(1), B\u2217)\n]\n.

(47)\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 355\nWe now consider the anzatz \u03c8\u03c13\u03b21\u2217 \u0007 1. Neglecting terms at order \u03c82\u03c13\u03b21\u2217 , we\nreadily find\n\u03c8\n\u03c13\u03b21\u2217 =\n(\n\u03c13\u03b21 + 1\n\u03c12\u03c13\u03b221\n\u03c81\n) \u03c13\u03b21\n\u03c13\u03b21+1\n.

With the pa-\nrameters in Table 1, the left-hand side of (49) is approximately 0.02, and does not\nexceed 0.05, on varying \u03b21, within the interval [3, 16]. Thus, we have at leading\norder in $,\nnmax = k2\nk3\n(\n1\u2212 \u03c12B\u2217\n)\n= k2\nk3\n(\n1\u2212 \u03c12\u03b21\u03c8\u03c13\u03b21\u2217 (1+O(\u03c8\u03c13\u03b21\u2217 ))\n)\n(50)\nwhere \u03c8\u03c13\u03b21\u2217 is given in equation (49) (and the factor of k2\/k3 arises from the\nrescaling (20)).\n4.5.2. Numerical verification\nIn Figure 6 we compare the approximation (50) to the numerical value of Nmax\nkeeping all parameters are fixed as given in Table 1, except for \u03b2 which is varied\nwithin the extent of its biologically plausible range [3, 15], which results in a varia-\ntion of \u03b21 over the range [3.7, 15.7]. In Figure 7 we compare the approximation (50)\nto the numerical value of Nmax keeping all parameters fixed as given in Table 1 ex-\ncept, this time, for variations of k5. The motivation for varying \u03b2 and k5 is due to the\nfact these parameters are difficult to estimate empirically. One can readily observe\nthat both Figures 6 and 7 show the approximation (50) yields the same qualitative\ntrends as the numerical results for their respective parameter variations. The errors\ninvolved are relatively large for an O($) approximation; this is speculated to be\ndue to the fact that the maximum of N is particularly sensitive to the behaviour of\nthe system close to the inner-outer wavefront interface, where the approximations\nimplicit in the patching procedure are relatively inaccurate. One could improve\nthese approximations by performing a matching, rather than a patching, procedure\nbut this is not pursued for reasons of simplicity and as we are more interested in\nthe endothelial cell density maximum, which is less sensitive to inaccuracies in the\napproximations at the interfaces inherent in the patching procedure.\n356 E.A.

Endothelial cell density maximum\nIn this section we investigate analytically the endothelial cell density maximum,\nwhich is a measure of the angiogenic ability of the system and its ability to sup-\nply nutrients to the wound healing structural unit. We will find, for example, that\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 357\nthis maximum depends, at leading orders, on only a few parameter groupings. The\nimplications of this, in the context of how one may attempt to induce a greater\nangiogenic response, will be investigated in detail in section (5.3).\n4.6.1. Perturbation theory\nWe seek an approximation to B(2). Using (41) to eliminate N(2) from equation (42)\ngives, on rearrangement\nB(2) =\n\u03c14$4 + \u03b21[\u03c8\u221212 \u03c13(D +H(B(1), B(2)))]\n\u03c14$4 + [\u03c8\u221212 \u03c13(D +H(B(1), B(2)))]\nwhere\n\u03c82 =\n(\nB(2)\n\u03b21 \u2212 B(2)\n) 1\n\u03c13\u03b21\n.\nThus one has either that\nB(2) = \u03b21 \u2212O($4)\nor, noting D \u223c O($4), that\nH(B(1), B(2)) \u2264 O($4)\u0007 1.\nAll observations from our numerical simulations indicate that B(2) \u0015= \u03b21 \u2212O($4),\nand thus we consider the latter. Neglecting orders of $4, and using (46) we have\n(1\u2212 \u03c12\u03b21)\u03c82 + \u03c12\u03b21\n\u222b \u03c82\n0\ndx\n1+ x\u03c13\u03b21 = (1\u2212 \u03c12\u03b21)\u03c81 + \u03c12\u03b21\n\u222b \u03c81\n0\ndx\n1+ x\u03c13\u03b21\n= \u03c81 +O\n(\n\u03c81\u03c8\n\u03c13\u03b21\n1\n\u03b21\n\u223c $\n5\n\u03b221\n)\n. (51)\nAs usual, we neglect terms of order $4. The above equation for\u03c82 has two solutions;\nthe smaller one gives \u03c82 \u223c 0, Bmax \u0007 1, which is inappropriate and hence we\nseek the larger solution. In general, one should seek the solution to (51) to obtain\nthe asymptotic estimate for \u03c82, and hence Bmax . However, noting \u03c81 \u0007 1 one\nmay consider an expansion in terms of \u03c81, which will be valid in quite general\ncircumstances, as investigated below. Defining the function\nF(p) = (1\u2212 \u03c12\u03b21)p + \u03c12\u03b21\n\u222b p\n0\ndx\n1+ x\u03c13\u03b21\nwe have F(\u03c82) = \u03c81 (neglecting the O($5\/\u03b221 ) term). Treating \u03c81 as asymptoti-\ncally small, and writing \u03c82 as power series in \u03c81 gives, via standard perturbation\ntechniques, that\n\u03c82 = \u03c802 +\n\u03c81\nF \u2032(\u03c802 )\n\u2212 F\n\u2032\u2032(\u03c802 )\u03c8\n2\n1\n2F \u20322(\u03c802 )\n+ ... (52)\n358 E.A. Gaffney et al.\nwhere\n1\n\u03c802\n\u222b \u03c802\n0\ndx\n1+ x\u03c13\u03b21 =\n\u03c12\u03b21 \u2212 1\n\u03c12\u03b21\n. (53)\nThis gives, at leading order in \u03c81 and $,\n\u03c82 = \u03c802\nBmax = B0(2) +O($,\u03c81), B0(2) =\n\u03b21(\u03c8\n0\n2 )\n\u03c13\u03b21\n1+ (\u03c802 )\u03c13\u03b21\n. (54)\nThis constitutes a particularly useful perturbative approximation for Bmax which,\nas we will investigate below, is valid for biologically relevant parameters whenever\n\u03b21 is sufficiently small. For example, one requires\u03b21 < 9 when all other parameters\nare as given in Table 1).\n4.6.2. Correction terms and validity of the approximation Bmax = B0(2).\nBefore numerically investigating the above approximations for Bmax we consider\nthe validity of taking \u03c81 as asymptotically small in equation (54) by investigating\nthe corrective terms in (52).\nWe consider the first correction term initially. As shown in Appendix (C), via\nthe inequalities (70) and (71), one has\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c81F \u2032(\u03c802 )\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 < A\u03c81 \u2264 (9\/5)\u03c81 \u0007 1 (55)\nwhere A def= 1 for \u03b21 \u2265 5 and A def= 9\/5 for \u03b21 \u2208 [7\/2, 5], and all other parameters\nconsistent with the parameter estimations given in Appendix (A). Hence the first\ncorrection term is small.\nHowever, the second and higher correction terms need not be negligible for\nbiologically relevant parameters. Noting B0(2) \u2208 [0, \u03b21], the second correction term\ngives\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c821F \u2032\u2032(\u03c802 )2F \u20322(\u03c802 )\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u03c821\u03c12\u03c13\u03b221 (\u03c802 )\u03c13\u03b21\u221212(1+ (\u03c802 )\u03c13\u03b21)2|F \u20322(\u03c802 )|\n=\n\u03c821\u03c12\u03c13(B\n0\n(2))\n1\u2212 1\n\u03c13\u03b21 (\u03b21 \u2212 B0(2))\n1+ 1\n\u03c13\u03b21\n2|F \u20322(\u03c802 )|\n<\u223c A\n2\u03c821\u03c12\u03c13\u03b2\n2\n1\n2\nThis indicates that \u03c82 = \u03c802 is a good approximation provided A2\u03c821\u03c12\u03c13\u03b221 \u0007 1.\nFor higher order terms, simple power counting indicates that the nth correction\nterm is O(\u03c12\u03c1n\u221213 \u03b2\nn\n1A\nn\u03c8n1 ). Consequently, if A2\u03c821\u03c123\u03b221 \u0007 min(1, \u03c13\/\u03c12), pow-\ner counting would subsequently indicate that all correction terms are small and thus\nthat the approximation \u03c82 = \u03c802 is accurate. Note that on varying \u03b21, with all other\nparameters as in Table 1, we always have \u03c13\/\u03c12 < 1, while A2\u03c821\u03c12\u03c13\u03b221 < $ for\n\u03b21 < 9, but A2\u03c821\u03c12\u03c13\u03b221 > 0.75 for \u03b21 > 11.5. This indicates that \u03c82 = \u03c802\nis a good approximation for biologically reasonable parameters provided \u03b21 does\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 359\nnot lie towards the upper end of its biological bounds. For higher values of \u03b21, one\nmust solve (51) to obtain a perturbative approximation for Bmax which unfortu-\nnately does not possess a simpler, but accurate, representation. However note that\nit is straightforward to deduce from equation (51) that an increase in the value of\n\u03c81 always results in a decrease in the value of Bmax .\n4.6.3. Numerical verification\nFigures 8, 9 and 10 compare the numerical value of Bmax to the perturbative\napproximation given by equation (54), which is represented by the dashed line in\nall figures, and the perturbative approximation given by the solution of equation\n(51), which is denoted by the solid line in all figures.\nIn Figure 8 we consider the effect of varying \u03b21, fixing all other parameters as\ngiven in Table 1. The approximations are excellent for smaller values of \u03b21. For\nlarger values of \u03b21, the approximation given by (54) loses accuracy. The solution of\n(51) yields an improved approximation for larger values of \u03b21, which is consistent\nwith the above observations.\nIn Figure 9 we consider the variation of k2 = k3 in the interval [0.3, 0.83],\nfixing all other parameters as given in Table 1. We do not exceed k2 = k3 = 0.83,\nbecause of the constraint k4 > k2, as discussed in Appendix A.2. We see that for\nrelatively small k2 = k3 the estimate given by the solution of (51) is substantial-\nly more accurate. Note that while reducing k2 = k3 does not affect \u03c81, we have\n\u03c13\u03c12 \u223c k\u221212 k\u221213 and hence the condition \u03c821\u03c12\u03c13\u03b221 \u0007 1 is eventually violated.\nConsequently, for smaller values of k2 = k3 one must use the solution of (51). One\ncan observe from Figure 9 that the solution of (51) does indeed yield an estimate\nfor Bmax consistent with a term at leading order in $. We note from Figure 8 that\nFig. 8.

Obviously, one should also consider the variation of Bmax with\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 361\nk5; this is addressed below, as part of an investigation as to whether amending cell\nmotility parameters can affect the angiogenic response.\n5. Discussion\n5.1. Qualitative predictions and the propagation Speed\nBy consideration of the main cellular processes involved in wound-healing angio-\ngenesis, we have developed and analysed a new model for wound-healing angio-\ngenesis. It differs from previous models in that it focuses only on the endothelial\ncells and the capillary tips, thus constituting a minimal model for which analytical\ninsight can, and should, be developed, before extension and generalisation.\nAll our simulations of the model show the development of a wave-like profile\nprogressing towards the centre of the wound, exhibiting the qualitative features\nempirically observed in cutaneous wound healing. There is a definite \u2018structural\nunit\u2019, consisting of a peak of capillary tips, closely followed by a peak in blood ves-\nsel density, moving in concert towards the wound centre. Additionally, the whole\nwounded region exhibits elevated endothelial cell density, as one would expect with\nthe formation of granulation tissue in the wound. Thus the model\u2019s qualitative pre-\ndictions are in complete accord with observation. Consequently, one is interested\nin the quantitative predictions of the model, and how these may be interpreted in\nterms of a healing wound.\nThe first quantitative prediction of this model is that the speed of the structural\nunit is given by the theoretical minimum travelling wave speed,\n\u221a\n4C1k2. Numeri-\ncally, one always observes that the actual speed of the structural unit asymptotically\ntends to\n\u221a\n4C1k2 on the biological domain. One must note that the validity of this\nobservation is not necessarily obvious given the model does not evolve to a trav-\nelling wave on the biological domain. Nonetheless, the minimum travelling wave\nspeed has proven to be a very accurate predictor for the structural unit\u2019s speed of\npropagation in the model. Thus, the structural unit\u2019s speed is determined simply by\nthe rateC1 of capillary tip diffusive random motion and the rate k2 of tip branching.\nWe note that a stochastic model of angiogenesis has produced a similar prediction;\nthat the rate of vessel ingrowth is strongly dependent on the rate of endothelial cell\nmigration, but not on the rate of proliferation (as long as some takes place) [15,18].\n5.2. Predictions for the capillary tip density maximum\nDespite the relative complexity of this multiparameter model, one can apply per-\nturbative techniques to obtain information concerning travelling wave solutions,\nwhich in turn, give useful information concerning the structural unit. One can de-\ntermine that a crude approximation for the maximum of the capillary tip density, is\ngiven by\nNmax = k2\nk3\n(\n1\u2212 \u03c12\u03b21\u03c8\u03c13\u03b21\u2217\n)\n\u03c8\n\u03c13\u03b21\u2217 =\n(\n\u03c13\u03b21 + 1\n\u03c12\u03c13\u03b221\n(\nk5\u03c14\n\u03c13\u03b21\n$5\n) 1\n\u03c13\u03b21\n) \u03c13\u03b21\n\u03c13\u03b21+1\n, (56)\n362 E.A. Gaffney et al.\nand this has explicitly been shown to agree, at least approximately, with the numer-\nical simulations for a wide range of parameter values. This agreement is useful for\ntwo reasons. Firstly, it lends support to our hypothesis that one can determine use-\nful information concerning the structural unit from the minimum speed travelling\nwave. Secondly, it should be noted that increasing capillary tip densities within the\nstructural unit relies primarily upon increasing k2\/k3, and on reducing \u03c12\u03b21\u03c8\u03c13\u03b21\u2217 .\nThe fact that k2\/k3 strongly influences Nmax is not surprising; however, the fact\nthat the other parameters influence Nmax by the parameter grouping \u03c12\u03b21\u03c8\u03c13\u03b21\u2217\nwould be difficult to predict other than by analytical means.\n5.3. Predictions for the endothelial cell density maximum\nDetailed consideration of Nmax is not as relevant or interesting as investigating\nthe maximum of the endothelial cell density, Bmax , within the structural unit, as\nthis constitutes a measure of the angiogenic ability of the system and its ability to\nsupply nutrients to the wound healing structural unit. First of all, the perturbative\nframework enables us to make the modelling prediction that altering aspects of the\nendothelial cell density remodelling mechanism will not increase the strength of the\nangiogenic response. This is because the terms governing this mechanism within\nthe model are pre-multiplied by \u03c14$4 so, increasing the effects of this mechanism by\na factor of 50 will not change the perturbative structure of the model. Furthermore,\nif \u03b21 is small, so that \u03c821\u03c1\n2\n3\u03b2\n2\n1 \u0007 min (1, \u03c13\/\u03c12), upregulating the remodelling\nmechanism, corresponding to altering parameters so as to increase \u03c14, simply will\nnot affect the angiogenic response. If the parameters however are such that \u03c81 is\nnot negligible, then increasing \u03c14 will increase \u03c81, which will lead to a counter\nintuitive decrease in Bmax . However, this reduction will be relatively small as the\ndependence of Bmax on \u03c14 is via \u03c81 \u223c \u03c1(\u03c13\u03b21)\n\u22121\n4 , and thus is weak due to the fact\nthat \u03c13\u03b21 is large when \u03c821\u03c1\n2\n3\u03b2\n2\n1 \u0015\u0007 min (1, \u03c13\/\u03c12). Thus, we have the prediction\nthat increasing the remodelling response will, at best, have no effect or, at worst,\nbe mildly counter-productive.\nIn Figure 11 we test this observation numerically by fixing all parameters, ex-\ncept \u03bd, as in Table 1, and observing that increasing \u03bd by a factor of 50 results only\nin a small decrease of Bmax , as predicted above.\nLooking at how Bmax depends on the model parameters in the perturbative\nframework indicates that Bmax is independent of the parameters influencing cell\nmotility, except possibly via the k5 dependence of \u03c81. There are a number of points\nto note here. Firstly, k5 is a ratio of carrying capacities, and hence one may an-\nticipate that is is not easily manipulated experimentally. Secondly, it is difficult to\nestimate k5. Thirdly, we have the scaling \u03c81 \u223c (k5\u03bd$5)1\/\u03c13\u03b21 and the observation,\nfrom Figure 11, that while varying \u03bd by a factor of 50 does alter\u03c81, it is only enough\nto cause small changes in Bmax . Consequently, varying k5 over one, possibly even\ntwo, orders of magnitude again only results in small changes in Bmax . Thus, we\nhave following conclusions. Firstly, our inability to estimate k5 accurately does not\naffect our ability to make predictions for Bmax . Secondly, we have the modelling\nprediction that the angiogenic response of the system, as measured by Bmax is, at\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 363\nFig. 11.

All other parameter values are as in Table (1, except\nthat \u03b2 = 5.0. The graph for \u03b2 = 10.0, not shown, is very similar, though the asymptotic\napproximations are less accurate, as observed in section (4.6.3)\nleading orders of magnitude, insensitive to parameters influencing cell motility, in-\ncluding k5 which only weakly influences Bmax , via \u03c81. Such predictions have been\nvalidated against simulations of the full partial differential equation model. For ex-\nample, in Figure 12, we consider the variation in k5, which, as one would anticipate\nfrom the asymptotics, yields results which are very similar to those presented in\nFigure 11. One is primarily interested in increasing the angiogenic capabilities of\nthe system and thus Bmax , which depends on the parameters \u03b21, \u03c12\u03b21, \u03c13\u03b21 and\n\u03c81. However, as we have seen in all figures the general trend of how Bmax depends\non parameter values is reproduced by equation (54), with the influence of\u03c81 acting\nas a corrective term for higher values of \u03b21. To determine how one may manipulate\nparameters so as to induce as large an increase as possible in Bmax we therefore\nfocus on equation (54), and hence the parameters \u03b21, \u03c12 and \u03c13.\nThe parameter \u03b2 represents the ratio of the carrying capacity of capillary tip\ninduced endothelial cell proliferation to the carrying capacity of logistic remodel-\nling endothelial cell proliferation. Consequently, one would intuitively expect that\nincreasing \u03b2 will increaseBmax , the (non-dimensionalised) endothelial cell density,\nas observed in Figure 8. However, it is likely that manipulation of \u03b2 is not empiri-\ncally possible. Hence we treat \u03b2 as fixed. Furthermore, we have \u03b21 = \u03b2 + k5k4\/\u03c7 .\nWe consider below only variations induced by manipulating the angiogenic system\nsuch that\n\u03b4\n(\nk5k4\n\u03c7\n)\n\u0007 \u03b21 = \u03b2 + k5k4\n\u03c7\n.

Comparison of numerical maximum of B (individually plotted) with the approx-\nimation given in equation (54) (dashed line) and the solution to equation (51) (solid line)\non varying k5 in the interval [0.1, 1.0]. All other parameter values are as in Table (1, except\nthat \u03b2 = 5.0. The graph for \u03b2 = 10.0, not shown, is very similar, though the asymptotic\napproximations are less accurate, as observed in section (4.6.3)\ni.e. that \u03b21 is essentially unchanged by the variation of k5k4\/\u03c7 . Note that k5 is a\nfunction of carrying capacities, and is therefore unlikely to be altered by empirical\nmanipulations of the angiogenesis system. Given that k5k4\/\u03c7 \u0007 \u03b2 for biologically\nreasonable parameters, this restriction is therefore that the empirical manipulations\nof the angiogenesis system do not induce changes in (k4\/\u03c7) that are orders of mag-\nnitude greater than typically measured values of (k4\/\u03c7). With this restriction, we\nare consequently interested in variations of\n\u03c12 = k4\nk2\n, \u03c13 = \u03c7\nk3\n(58)\nwhere k4 governs the strength of anastomosis, k2 governs the proliferation rate of\ncapillary tips, k2 = k3 and \u03c7 governs the rate of capillary tip induced endothelial\ncell proliferation.\nIt is straightforward to deduce from equation (54) that \u03c802 , and hence B0(2) \u223c\nBmax , is monotonically increasing in \u03c13 and monotonically decreasing in \u03c12. This\nis in complete accord with intuition. For example, it predicts that stimulating cap-\nillary tip induced endothelial cell proliferation increases B0(2) \u223c Bmax , whereas\nstimulating anastomosis decreases B0(2) \u223c Bmax .\nGiven an angiogenic scenario, one is interested in what specific changes can be\nmade so as to maximally increase blood vessel formation. Typically, one can alter\ncell motility and cell proliferation rates via the stimulation of growth factor produc-\ntion, or the exogenous addition of growth factors. Clearly, the model predicts that\nadding factors that simply stimulate cell motility will not greatly affect blood ves-\nsel formation. Adding growth factors will typically reduce cell cycle times but will\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 365\nnot affect carrying capacities, which generally are determined by other limitations,\nsuch as requirements for nutrients and physical space. Consider adding growth\nfactor which uniformly stimulates proliferation for all cell types (without affecting\ncarrying capacities). One would have the scaling k2 \u2192 3k2, k3 \u2192 3k3, \u03c7 \u2192 3\u03c7\nand \u03bd \u2192 3\u03bd, with 3 > 1, which will decrease \u03c12 but will leave \u03c13 unaffected.\nConsider instead, adding a cell specific factor that preferentially stimulates capil-\nlary tip proliferation, but again does not affect carrying capacities. This will again\ndecrease \u03c12 but it will also decrease \u03c13, and consequently cannot give a greater\nincrease in blood vessel formation than simply increasing cell proliferation uni-\nformly. Consider a third possibility, whereby one adds a cell specific factor that\npreferentially stimulates cells other than those constituting the capillary tips, and\nagain does not affect carrying capacities. This will increase \u03c7 (and \u03bd) while leaving\nk2 and k3 unaffected, and so will increase \u03c13, and not affect \u03c12. This leaves the\ninteresting possibility that stimulating all cells to proliferate may be less effective\nin increasing blood vessel formation than stimulating all cells except those at cap-\nillary tips. One clearly has the requirement that Bmax is more sensitive to changes\nin \u03c12 than \u03c13 for the stimulation of all cells to proliferate is more effective.\nHowever, the relative sensitivities of Bmax to the parameters \u03c12 and \u03c13 is not\nimmediately obvious, even when considering the perturbative approximations for\nBmax . We consider the simplest approximation, namely B0(2), as given by equation\n(54), since it is relatively easy to manipulate and yet, as we have seen above on nu-\nmerous occasions, successfully predicts the general dependence of Bmax on model\nparameters. Working with this approximation, one can show, after some algebra,\nthat\n4\ndef=\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202B0(2)\/\u2202\u03c12\u2202B0(2)\/\u2202\u03c13\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = [\u03c122\u03b221 (\u03c802 )\u03c13\u03b21 \u222b 0\u2212\u221e dz ze\n(\u03c13\u03b21+1)z\n(1+ (\u03c802 )\u03c13\u03b21e\u03c13\u03b21z)2\n]\u22121\n.\n(59)\nFor (\u03c802 )\n\u03c13\u03b21 \u0007 1, one can readily approximate the integral to determine that\n4approx \u223c (\u03c13\u03b21 + 1)\n2\n\u03c122\u03b2\n2\n1 (\u03c8\n0\n2 )\n\u03c13\u03b21\n(60)\nand, via numerical integration, one can confirm that4 = 4approx holds to a within\na relative error of \u223c 35% for (\u03c802 )\u03c13\u03b21 < 1.\nTherefore, when\n4approx < 1 and (\u03c802 )\u03c13\u03b21 < 1 (61)\none has a leading order prediction that B0(2) is more sensitive to the parameter \u03c13\nthan \u03c12. Consequently one has the leading order prediction that targeting prolif-\nerative stimulation of cells other than those at capillary tips would, under such\ncircumstances, be more effective than unspecific proliferative stimulation. We pro-\nceed to verify this with the improved approximation to Bmax , given by the solution\nof equation (51).\n366 E.A.

One can see that there is a good correlation between\nthe approximation arising from the use of 4approx and from equation (51) as to the\nregions of parameter space whereBmax is more sensitive to changes in \u03c13. Consider\nthe lower graph of Figure 13, which is a plot of B0(2). One can see that the region\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 367\nwhere B0(2) is predicted to be more sensitive to \u03c13 (in blue in the upper graphs of\nFigure (13)) are regions where B0(2) < \u03b21\/2 (= 2.75), i.e. (\u03c802 )\u03c13\u03b21 < 1. Hence,\nas required, the second of the conditions in equation (61) holds in this region.\nConsequently, we have a modelling prediction that the region of parameter space\nwhere preferential proliferative stimulation of cells excluding those at capillary tips\ninduces a greater angiogenic response is characterised by1\n1 > 4approx = (\u03c13\u03b21 + 1)\n2\n\u03c122\u03b2\n2\n1\u03c8\n\u03c13\u03b21\n= \u03c1\n2\n3\n\u03c122\u03c8\n\u03c13\u03b21\n(\n1+ 1\n\u03b21\n)2\n= \u03c7\n2k22\nk23k\n2\n4\u03c8\n\u03c13\u03b21\n(\n1+ 1\n\u03b21\n)2\n= \u03c7\n2\nk24\u03c8\n\u03c13\u03b21\n(\n1+ 1\n\u03b21\n)2\nFurthermore, for \u03c8\u03c13\u03b21 \u0007 1 one has, from equation (54), \u03c8\u03c13\u03b21 \u223c \u03c13\/\u03c12 \u223c\n\u03c7\/k4.

This is not surprising from the fact that B(2), given in equation\n(54), becomes a less accurate predictor for the solution of (51) as \u03b21 increases (see section\n(4.6.2) and Figure 8). Similarly, one would also expect that the correlation between 4 and\n|(\u2202Bmax\/\u2202\u03c12)\/(\u2202Bmax\/\u2202\u03c13)| will decrease in accuracy as \u03b21 increases, but will nonetheless\npredict the correct trends.\n368 E.A.

Parameter Estimates\nIn the following, the estimation of n0, x0, T and the non-dimensionalised parame-\nters listed in (64) is discussed in detail. The results of the section are summarised\nin Table 1.\nThe value x0 used in the non-dimensionalisation is the half-width of the wound\nand taken to be 0.5cm. T is taken to be 1 day = 86400 seconds.\nWithout loss of generality, one may conveniently define n0 to be the dimen-\nsionalised carrying capacity of capillary tips. To the authors\u2019 knowledge it is not\npossible to estimate this carrying capacity from empirical observation as there is\ncurrently no experimental data for capillary tip densities. However, it serves only\none purpose in the model, namely to scale from the non-dimensionalised model\npredictions of capillary tip density to give dimensionalised predictions. Thus, as\nlong as we need only consider relative, rather than absolute, values of capillary\ntip and endothelial cell densities for our modelling observations and conclusions,\nsuch restrictions do not affect the modelling. Note that with this definition of n0\nwe require k2 = k3.\nVariations of \u03c2\u02dc and n\u02dcinit do not affect the model greatly, in that they deter-\nmine initial conditions, which are \u201cforgotten\u201d as the solution moves towards its\ntravelling wave attractor (provided the initial conditions still lie in the basin of the\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 369\ntravelling wave attractor). We take \u03c2\u02dc and n\u02dcinit to be small (relative to unity) with\ntypical values of 0.25. This simply represents the fact that the preliminary elevated\ncapillary tip density does not extend extensively into the unwounded area, and does\nnot exceed nmax at t = 0. The latter can be verified a posteriori, by consideration\nof Figure 2 for example. The diffusion coefficient associated with individual and\nindependent cells is typically between 10\u22129 and 10\u22128cm2s\u22121 [6]. The lower bound\nis particularly appropriate for this case, as the motion of the endothelial cells consti-\ntuting the capillary tips involves the orchestrated movement of a number of cells in\nunison, which may reduce the effective diffusion coefficient, possibly below even\n10\u22129cm2s\u22121. Taking D1 = 10\u22129cm2s\u22121 yields C1 = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 for the non-di-\nmensionalised diffusion coefficient (though this may be an overestimate). We note\nthat C1 is the key diffusion coefficient, as together with k2, it dictates the travelling\nwave speed (see section (4.1)). We estimate C2 simply by C1 = C2 so that neither\nof the capillary tip transport mechanisms, i.e. random motion and convection down\nendothelial cell gradients, dominate in the model.\nThe parameter grouping \u03bb6\u03bdb0 can be estimated by considering the normal slow\nremodelling of the vasculature, with n = 0. Ignoring spatial terms, and at low endo-\nthelial cell densities, we have approximately db\/dt \u223c \u03bb6\u03bdb0b. On average \u03bb6\u03bdb0b\nnew cells are created per unit length per unit time. In a study [7] of endothelial cell\nproliferation in various normal and cancerous tissues, tritated thymidine injections\nwere used to label proliferating cells, differentiating endothelial cells from other\ncell types by morphology. In normal skin it was found that the number of labelled\ncells per hundred endothelial cells increased by about 0.25 per day over seven days.\nThus, by considering a one day time interval, we have\n\u03bd\u02dc = \u03bb6\u03bdb0T \u223c ln\n(100+ 0.25\n100\n)\n\u223c 1\n400\ngiving an estimate for \u03bd\u02dc. We are, of course, ignoring cell cycle subtleties by using\nthe number of cells entering S-phase in any given time period as an estimate for\nthe number of cells that would have entered M-phase. However, such numbers are\nof the same order of magnitude, and hence the methodology is legitimate for order\nof magnitude estimates.\nThe parameter \u03c7\u02dc can be estimated by considering the maximum endothelial\ncell proliferation rate permitted by the model. For b small, and n relatively large\nwe have\ndb\ndt\n\u223c \u03bb6(\u03bdb0 + nmax\u03c7b1)b. (65)\nThe same study [7] also included a study of endothelial cell proliferation in near\noptimal conditions during placental growth. It was found that within two days of be-\nginning the tritiated thymidine injections 79.5% of endothelial cells were labelled.\nThus we have the estimate\n\u03c7\u02dc\nn\u2217\nn0\n\u223c \u03c7\u03bb6n\u2217\u03c7b1T \u223c 12 ln(1.8)\u2212 \u03bd\u02dc \u223c\n1\n2\nln(1.8) (66)\n370 E.A. Gaffney et al.\nwhere n\u2217 denotes the capillary tip density attained under optimal conditions, which\nis the carrying capacity density assuming capillary tip loss due to anastomosis is\nminimal. We thus take n\u2217 \u223c n0 giving an estimate that\n\u03c7\u02dc \u223c 1\n2\nln(1.8) \u223c 0.3. (67)\nDyson et al. [5] used both cell counts and microangiography combined with com-\nputer-assisted image analysis to measure vascularization of porcine dermal wounds\nin moist and dry environments. Using endothelial cell counts, it was found that the\nmaximum ratio of the number of endothelial cells per unit area in the wound space\n(mean \u00b1 standard deviation) compared to the number in uninjured dermis was\n6.7\u00b1 1.8 for a moist wound environment, and 4.5\u00b1 1.5 for a dry wound environ-\nment. The corresponding results using microangiography were 14.3 from vessel\ncounts and 5.0 from percentage area measurements. These give an estimate for \u03b2\nin the approximate range [3.5, 15]. We initially work with \u03b2 in the middle of this\nrange, taking \u03b2 = 9.29 (with the 3SF accuracy specified so that the ubiquitous\nparameter \u03b21\ndef= \u03b2 + k5k4\/\u03c7 is equal to 10.0, a convenient round number, for the\nreference set of parameters).\nThe parameter k2 can be estimated from the doubling time of capillary tips.\nThis is estimated via the typical doubling time of a proliferating cell (20\u201324 hours),\nas capillary tip proliferation is ultimately driven by endothelial cell proliferation.\nThus, we take k2 = (24\/20) ln 2 \u223c 0.8, which gives us k3. The parameter k4 is\nmore difficult to estimate. We now motivate the constraint k4 \u2265 k2. One should\nconsider the travelling wave connecting the wounded steady-state (n, b) = (0, 0)\nto the unwounded steady-state (n, b) = (0, 1) in the phase-plane. The equation for\nn decouples from b in a linear expansion about these steady-states, giving\nC1n\n\u2032\u2032 \u2212 cn\u2032 + k2n = 0 (n, b) \u223c (0, 0)\nC1n\n\u2032\u2032 \u2212 cn\u2032 + k2n\u2212 k4n = 0 (n, b) \u223c (0, 1). (68)\nGiven c, k4 > 0, and with c2 \u2265 4C1k2 as required for non-negativity near (0, 0),\nthe eigenvalues at (0, 0) and (0, 1) are all of the same sign for k4 < k2, mak-\ning a connection between the two steady-states impossible. Thus, one must take\nk4 \u2265 k2 for a connection between the above two steady-states. We briefly note\nthat with k4 < k2 another non-negative steady-state exists, and with k4 = k2, this\nsteady-state confluences with the steady-state (n, b) = (0, 1). Consequently, for\nk4 \u2264 k2 there is a bifurcation in phase space. We do not consider this in the present\npaper. Further work is required to investigate whether it represents a mathemati-\ncal artefact, or a bifurcation yielding travelling waves linking (0,0) to a different,\npossibly pathological, steady-state. We therefore take k4 > k2 in this paper. Fur-\nthermore, if k4 is excessively larger than k2, the model would be likely to be trivial\nwith no capillary tip growth owing to excessive tip-sprout anastomosis, and thus k4\nand k2 should be of the same order of magnitude. Consequently, we initially take\nk4 = 0.85.\nEstimating k5 is difficult; all we can do is present a upper bound for k5. Recall-\ning that the parameter \u03bb5 is the number of endothelial cells within a capillary tip,\nModelling wound healing angiogenesis 371\nthe parameter k5\ndef= \u03bb5n0\/b0 represents the ratio of endothelial cells at the carry-\ning capacity limits of capillary tip density and remodelled endothelial cell density.\nDuring the formation of the granular tissue only a minority of the endothelial cells\nshould arise indirectly, via capillary tip proliferation and subsequent anastomosis\nfor the following reason. If anastomosis and other means of endothelial cell prolif-\neration or migration introduced cells into localised endothelial cell compartments at\nsimilar rates one would produce a blood vessel network with comparable densities\nof blood vessel junctions and endothelial cells, which would be inconsistent with\ntypical blood vessel networks. The bulk of the formation of the structural unit with-\nin the granular tissue in the model occurs in the inner region described in section\n(4.3), as minimal angiogenesis occurs in the wavefront region, while the waveback\nregion is predominantly governed by the remodelling process. Consequently, one\nanticipates that in the inner region the increase in endothelial cell density due to\nanastomosis is subleading compared to the increase in endothelial cell density due\nto other mechanisms in the model, the dominant one of which is proliferation. With\nthe definitions \u03c13 = \u03c7\u02dc\/k3 and \u03b21 = \u03b2 + k5k4\/\u03c7\u02dc , this requires that k5\/(\u03c13\u03b21) in\nequation (27) is asymptotically small, giving a bound for k5. Thus we only con-\nsider values of k5 for which k5\/\u03c13\u03b2 \u2264 O($), where $ (= 1\/4) is the asymptotic\nparameter in our perturbative expansion. This reasoning underlies the derivation\nof equation (28). For definiteness, we take k5 = 1\/4 in Table 1 which, of course,\nsatisfies the above constraint.\nB. Numerics\nThe equations of this model constitute a set of non-linear coupled with convec-\ntive-diffusion equations, with non-linear kinetics. A minor point to note is that, in\npractice, the initial conditions are slightly smoothed to facilitate numerical solu-\ntion. The key difficulty with numerically solving these equations is the presence\nof diffusion and convection simultaneously, which tends to yield artefact oscilla-\ntions in many numerical schemes. Computer speed is not particularly important\nwith one-dimensional simulations, and hence we used an explicit, rather than an\nimplicit, method. Artefact numerical oscillations are avoided by use of upwinding.\nThis, however, introduces the possibility of excessive artefactual numerical diffu-\nsion. This can typically be avoided in two ways. Use of a sufficiently small mesh,\nif possible, is adequate; otherwise, one can resort to recovery methods. It proved\npossible to use an explicit scheme, with upwinding, and a sufficiently small mesh\nto avoid numerical artefact diffusion for this model. Further details on these, and\nother, numerical techniques for convection-diffusion equations can be found in [9].\nC. Error bounds in perturbation theory\nWe consider the first correction term in section (4.6.2), with parameter values such\nthat \u03b21 > 5, in which case \u03c13\u03b21 > 5\/3 and \u03c12\u03b21 > 5. These constitute all but\nextreme values of the parameter space outlined in Appendix (A.2).

Hence one must have \u03c802 > \u03c8\u2217, i.e. (\u03c802 )\u03c13\u03b21 >\n(\u03c13\u03b21(b \u2212 1)\u2212 1). This gives an immediate contradiction if \u03c13\u03b21(b \u2212 1) \u2212 1 >(\n\u03c12\u03b21\n(\n1\u2212 b\u22121)\u2212 1)\u22121, i.e. if\n(\u03c13\u03b21(b \u2212 1)\u2212 1)\n(\n\u03c12\u03b21\n(\n1\u2212 1\nb\n)\n\u2212 1\n)\n\u2212 1 > 0. (69)\nIt is a straightforward matter to check that, given \u03c13\u03b21 > 5\/3, \u03c12\u03b21 > 5, taking\nb = 2 is sufficient to enforce the above inequality.
