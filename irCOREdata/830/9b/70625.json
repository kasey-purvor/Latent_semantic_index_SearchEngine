Accordingly,\nblood perfusion through the vessels in the skin surface\nconstantly adjusts to the skin temperature (1), and the skin\ntemperature and heat loss rate changes as a result. In this\nway, fluctuations in skin blood flow are subject to thermo-\nregulation (2). This enables us to examine the dynamics of\nthermoregulation from the point of view of the associated\ntimescales of fluctuation. Experiments have demonstrated\nentrainment of blood flow by suitable periodic thermal\nperturbation (2,3) and, correspondingly, phase coherence\nbetween simultaneously measured skin blood flow and skin\ntemperature (4). Nonlinear interplay characterized by nega-\ntive feedback control has been proposed to model the\ncomplex relationship between these two physiological mea-\nsures (5). However, whereas most of the above studies relate\neither mean values or fluctuations of skin blood flow and\ntemperature (6\u20138), here we seek the relationship between\nthese two variables when skin temperature is locally: i), re-\nduced by thermal shock and ii), gradually changed. We ex-\npect that the relationship obtained will support the hypothesis\nof feedback control with embedded nonlinearity, providing\ninsight into the underlying physiology and into the dynamical\nbehavior and characteristic response times of biochemical\nmechanisms, such as the promotion of vasoconstriction by\nnoradrenalin and nitric oxide synthase (9). To the best of our\nknowledge, no similar results on the time dependence of the\nrelationship between skin blood flow and temperature have\nbeen reported.\nThe data used to study the level of blood flow under ther-\nmal shock are the same as reported in an earlier study by\nBandrivskyy et al. (4). Simultaneous, continuous control re-\ncordings of basal skin blood flow and skin temperature, with\nthe sensors placed together on the volar aspect of the forearm,\nwere performed for 30 min; then under conditions of skin\ncooling for 20 min, then for 30 min thereafter, during the\nrecovery period. Skin cooling was induced by application of\nan ice pack to the measurement area and its immediate\nvicinity, through a layer of fabric to lessen discomfort.\nMeasurements were made on 10 healthy subjects. A temper-\nature sensor (Thermilinear, YSI, Yellow Springs, OH) con-\nnected to a signal conditioning unit (Cardiosignals, Joz\u02c7ef\nStefan Institute, Ljubljana Slovenia) was used to record skin\ntemperature. The resolution of temperature was 0.0003\u0002C\nwithin the measurement range of between 20 and 40\u0002C, using\n16-bit A\/D conversion scaled to 65 V. A Laser-Doppler\nprobe (DP1T-V2), connected to a DRT4 unit (Moor Instru-\nments, Axminster, UK) was used to record skin blood flow.\nThis technique allows noninvasive assessment of microvas-\ncular blood perfusion, expressed here in arbitrary perfusion\nunits (AU). The recorded signal indicates the integrated blood\nperfusion within the sampling volume, i.e., perfusion in the\ncapillaries, arterioles, venules, and dermal vascular plexa (10).\nThe sampling rate for both signals was 400 Hz. For analysis,\nthe signals were resampled to 10 Hz.\nThe mean basal values of skin temperature and blood flow\nwere 33.46 0.6\u0002C and 76 4AU, respectively. During cooling\nwith the ice pack, no distinctive plateau in skin temperature was\nreached within 20 min. The lowest skin temperature recorded\nfor any subject was 25.1\u0002C, and the maximum mean temper-\nature difference achieved for any subject was 6.8\u0002C. Con-\nversely, it took ;8 min for every subject to reach a plateau\ntemperature during the recovery period. This temperature was\n32 6 1\u0002C and this is not statistically different from the basal\ntemperature. The mean blood flow was 6 6 2 AU, also not\nsignificantly different from the basal level.\nThe relationship between blood flow and skin temperature\nduring cooling is shown in Fig. 1 a. The values are medians\nEditor: Herbert Levine.\n\u0003 2008 by the Biophysical Society\ndoi: 10.1529\/biophysj.107.127860\nBiophysical Journal: Biophysical Letters\nBiophysical Journal: Biophysical Letters L78\nof blood flow samples across 10 recordings plotted against\ncorresponding median values of the skin temperature sam-\nples. The x axis is reversed to correspond to the initial and\nfinal states in real time. The curve obtained is steeply\nsigmoid (r2\u00bc 0.67, p, 0.001). It can be seen that as long as\nskin temperature is above 31\u0002C, the level of skin blood flow\nis maintained at a constant level. It responds rapidly to a\nfurther decrease in skin temperature, indicating a tempera-\nture threshold at which vascular constriction begins. Fur-\nthermore, when the same graph was plotted for the recovery\nperiod (Fig. 1 b), a spontaneous increase in skin temperature\nwas followed by a slow increase in blood flow. Again, there\nis no immediate response but rather a slow increase, be-\ncoming more rapid after a temperature of ;31\u0002C is reached.\nThe values of blood flow recorded for a given skin tem-\nperature differed between the induced cooling and recovery\nwarming period (independent of the subject considered),\nindicating a hysteresis-like response. In this case, the rate of\nskin temperature change was allowed to depend on the ho-\nmeostatic response to the cooling and recovery stimuli, and so\nmay be asymmetric. Therefore, we performed another set of\nmeasurements during which the rate of change in temperature\nwas well controlled.\nFor local skin cooling and heating, we used a copper plate\n(;10 cm2 in area) with a small aperture (;8 mm2) in the\ncenter to accommodate the Laser-Doppler probe. Peltier\nelements linked to the plate and to the temperature controller\n(Temperature Controller, MTTC-1410, Melcor, Trenton, NJ)\ncontrolled the temperature of the plate to within 6 0.1\u0002C.\nThe temperature module was built in the Lancaster University\nDepartment of Physics\u2019 Workshop to meet the required\nspecifications. Skin temperature under the copper plate was\nmeasured with the same sensor as used in the earlier cooling\nstudy. This temperature sensor was placed on the volar\naspect of the lower arm, and the temperature control module,\nwith incorporated blood flow probe, was placed over it. The\ndistance between the flow and temperature sensors was mini-\nmized. The signal sampling rate was 1200 Hz, re-sampled to\n10 Hz before further analysis. Subjects lay supine on a bed in\na ventilated room at 20\u0002C.\nThree healthy subjects participated in the study, two males\nand one female (mean age 30.3 years). After 15 min of rest,\nsimultaneous measurements of skin temperature and blood\nflow were made as follows. After it was set to 24\u0002C, and skin\ntemperature was allowed to reach a steady state, the temper-\nature of the module was gradually increased to 42\u0002C, and then\ndecreased to 24\u0002C. The temperature of the module was\nchanged in constant steps at a rate of 1\u0002C\/min, as monitored\non the temperature controller. At this rate it took 37 min to\nround the loop between limiting values. Afterward, the sub-\njects were allowed 30 min to recover, and a similar procedure\nwas repeated; starting from 42\u0002C, the temperature was\nlowered to 24\u0002C and increased back to 42\u0002C. The selected\ntemperature limits have been found to cause a maximal level\nof localized vasoconstriction and vasodilation (6).\nThe stepwise module temperature change led to an approx-\nimately linear response of the skin temperature. However, the\nskin temperature recorded under the copper plate generally\ndiffered from the temperature of the copper plate itself. The\nskin temperature and plate temperature matched exactly only\nbetween 31 and 32\u0002C when heating from 24\u0002C, and between\n36 and 37\u0002Cwhen cooling from 42\u0002C. These particular values\ncorrespond to the lower and upper limits of the \u2018\u2018neutral zone\u2019\u2019\nof skin temperature, when a skin area of ;15 cm2 is studied\n(11), so the recorded skin temperature lagged slightly behind\nthe changing plate temperature in the neutral zone, for both\nheating and cooling. The decrease in blood flow shown in Fig.\n1 a, when the temperature falls below 31\u201332\u0002C, suggests a\nhomeostatic response to the temperature falling below the lower\nlimit value of the neutral zone. The higher limit value (36\u2013\n37\u0002C) also corresponds to the regime of temperature-related\nFIGURE 1 Skin blood flow versus skin temperature during\nlocal cooling with an ice pack (a) and recovery period (b),\nobtained in 10 healthy subjects.

Sampling rate is 10 Hz.\nBiophysical Journal: Biophysical Letters L79\nBiophysical Journal: Biophysical Letters\nstructural changes in hemoglobin (12), and this may play a\nrole in the increased level of blood flow during warming.\nWhen each sample of blood flow is plotted against the\ncorresponding skin temperature sample, plots like those in\nFig. 2, a and b, are obtained. Fig. 2 shows a representative\nresult for one subject. It can be seen that the level of blood\nflow depends on skin temperature with memory. In addition,\ntwo different paths are obtained depending on the initial state.\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that the response of\nskin blood flow to a change in skin temperature may exhibit a\npath contingent upon rate-dependent memory. The memory\nphenomenon is evident when skin is subject to a cold shock as\nwell as during gradual, well-controlled skin-temperature\nchange. We have shown that a steady level of skin blood\nflow must be significantly perturbed by a thermal shock to\ncause vasodilation\/constriction. Thus, the differing tempera-\nture flow curves obtained during heating and cooling may be\ndue to true (path-dependent) hysteresis, indicating bistable or\nmultistable blood flow levels for a given temperature stimulus.\nIn addition, sensory integration of stimuli over time may result\nin a delayed temperature response (a rate-dependent memory\neffect). Slowing the rate of controlled temperature change\nwould reduce rate-dependent effects, reducing the differences\nin blood flow patterns during heating and cooling and\nnarrowing the hysteresis curves. However, a (slower) rate of\n2\u0002C temperature change every 5 min was found to give very\nsimilar hysteresis curves, suggesting that path-dependent\nhysteresis effects are dominant. Depending on the prior\nstimulus, both the skin cooling and skin heating curves differ\neven after 20 min, up to the limit of complete vasodilation or\nvasoconstriction.\nThese hysteresis phenomena in the homeostatic response\nshould be taken into account when comparing blood flow\nand skin temperature under thermal perturbations.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Andriy Bandrivskyy, Alan Bernjak, and Peter V.
