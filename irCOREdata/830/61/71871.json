This \ncombines concepts and tools from critical semiotic analysis and from critical political \neconomy to produce a distinctive post-disciplinary approach to capitalist social \nformations.2 CPE differs from other cultural turns in part through its concern with the \nkey mechanisms that determine the co-evolution of the semiotic and extra-semiotic \naspects of political economy. These mechanisms are mediated through the general \nfeatures of semiosis as well as the particular forms and institutional dynamics of \ncapitalism. Combining these general and particular mediations prompts two lines of \ninvestigation. First, given the infinity of possible meaningful communications and \n(mis)understandings enabled by semiosis, how do extra-semiotic as well as semiotic \nfactors affect the variation, selection, and retention of semiosis and its associated \npractices in ordering, reproducing and transforming capitalist social formations? And, \nsecond, given the contradictions, dilemmas, indeterminacy, and overall improbability \nof capitalist reproduction, especially during its recurrent crises, what role does \nsemiosis play in construing, constructing, and temporarily stabilizing capitalist social \nformations? Before proceeding, I should note that analogous approaches could be \ndeveloped for non-capitalist regimes by combining critical semiotic analysis with \nconcepts suited to their respective economic forms and institutional dynamics. \n \nIn making a case for CPE, I first present some ontological, epistemological, and \nmethodological claims about critical semiotic analysis and critical political economy \ntogether with some substantive claims about the role of semiotic practices in \nconstructing as well as construing economic objects and subjects. A second set of \narguments concerns the interaction of the semiotic and extra-semiotic in constituting \nand reproducing agency and structure. This approach is illustrated from the rise of \nthe \u2018knowledge-based economy\u2019 (KBE) as a provisional, partial, and unstable \nsemiotic-material solution to the crisis of Atlantic Fordism. This reveals how \nsemiosis, especially in struggles over accumulation strategies, state projects, and \nhegemonic visions, contributes to the rise of functioning post-Fordist economies and, \n 2\nin turn, how material preconditions are involved in selecting and consolidating \u2018KBE\u2019 \ndiscourses. I conclude with some general remarks on CPE and cultural studies. \n \n1. On Cultural Political Economy \n \nThree features make CPE distinctive theoretically. First, along with other currents in \nevolutionary and institutional political economy and in contrast with generic studies \non semiosis, CPE opposes transhistorical analyses, insisting that both history and \ninstitutions matter in economic and political dynamics. Second, in contrast with other \ncurrents in evolutionary and institutional political economy but in common with other \nvariants of cultural materialism, it takes the cultural turn seriously, highlighting the \ncomplex relations between meanings and practices. And, third, as opposed to either \ntradition considered separately, it combines evolutionary and institutional political \neconomy with the cultural turn. It explores these complex relations in terms of three \ngeneric evolutionary mechanisms: variation, selection, and retention (Campbell \n1969). This is reflected in its concern with the co-evolution of semiotic and extra-\nsemiotic processes and their conjoint impact in the constitution of capitalist social \nformations. This general approach can be re-stated in terms of four broad claims. \n  \nOntologically, CPE claims that semiosis contributes to the overall constitution of \nspecific social objects and social subjects and, a fortiori, to their co-constitution and \nco-evolution in wider ensembles of social relations. Orthodox political economy tends \nto naturalize or reify its theoretical objects (such as land, machines, the division of \nlabour, money, commodities, the information economy) and to offer impoverished \naccounts of how subjects and subjectivities are formed and how different modes of \ncalculation emerge, come to be institutionalized, and get modified. In contrast, CPE \nviews technical and economic objects as socially constructed, historically specific, \nmore or less socially (dis)embedded in broader networks of social relations and \ninstitutional ensembles, more or less embodied ('incorporated' and embrained), and \nin need of continuing social 'repair' work for their reproduction. Social construction \ninvolves material elements too, of course; but these can be articulated within limits in \ndifferent ways through the intervention of semiotic practices. Analogous arguments \napply to the state and politics (Jessop 1990, 2002; Mitchell 1991).  \n \n 3\nEpistemologically, CPE critiques the categories and methods typical of orthodox \npolitical economy and emphasizes the inevitable contextuality and historicity of the \nlatter\u2019s claims to knowledge. It rejects any universalistic, positivist account of reality, \ndenies the facticity of the subject-object duality, allows for the co-constitution of \nsubjects and objects, and eschews reductionist approaches to economic analysis. \nBut it also stresses the materiality of social relations and highlights the constraints \ninvolved in processes that operate 'behind the backs' of the relevant agents. It is \nespecially concerned with the structural properties and dynamics that result from \nsuch material interactions. It thereby escapes both the sociological imperialism of \npure social constructionism and the voluntarist vacuity of certain lines of discourse \nanalysis, which seem to imply that agents can will anything into existence in and \nthrough an appropriately articulated discourse. In short, CPE recognizes both the \nconstitutive role of semiosis and the emergent extra-semiotic features of social \nrelations and their conjoint impact on capacities for action and transformation.  \n \nMethodologically, CPE combines concepts and tools from critical semiotic analysis \nwith those from critical political economy. The cultural turn includes approaches \noriented to argumentation, narrativity, rhetoric, hermeneutics, identity, reflexivity, \nhistoricity, and discourse; here I use semiosis, i.e., the intersubjective production of \nmeaning, to cover them all.3 For they all assume that semiosis is causally efficacious \nas well as meaningful and that actual events and processes and their emergent \neffects can not only be interpreted but also explained, at least in part, in terms of \nsemiosis. Thus CPE examines the role of semiosis and semiotic practices not only in \nthe continual (re-)making of social relations but also in the contingent emergence, \nprovisional consolidation, and ongoing realization of their extra-semiotic properties.  \n \nStill arguing methodologically, just as there are variants of the cultural turn, political \neconomy also has different currents. My own approach to CPE draws mainly on the \nMarxist tradition. This examines the specificity of the basic forms, contradictions, \ncrisis-tendencies, and dilemmas of the capitalism, their conditions of existence, and \ntheir potential impact on other social relations. However, in contrast to orthodox \nMarxism, which, like orthodox economics, tends to reify and essentialize the different \nmoments of capital accumulation, treating them as objective forces, a Marxist-\ninspired CPE stresses their contingent and always tendential nature. For, if social \n 4\nphenomena are discursively constituted and never achieve a self-reproducing \nclosure, isolated from other social phenomena, then any natural necessities \n(emergent properties) entailed in the internal relations of a given object must be \ntendential. Such properties would only be fully realized if that object were fully \nconstituted and continually reproduced through appropriate discursive and social \npractices. This is inherently improbable: discursive relations are polysemic and \nheteroglossic, subjectivities are plural and changeable, and extra-semiotic properties \nare liable to material disturbances. For example, capitalist relations are always \narticulated with other production relations and are, at most, relatively dominant; \nmoreover, their operation is always vulnerable to disruption through internal \ncontradictions, the intrusion of relations anchored in other institutional orders and the \nlifeworld (civil society), and resistance rooted in conflicting interests, competing \nidentities, and rival modes of calculation. The resulting threats to the formal and\/or \nsubstantive unity of the capital relation mean that any tendencies inherent in \ncapitalism are themselves tendential, i.e., depend on the continuing reproduction of \nthe capital relation itself. Combined with critical political economy, critical semiotic \nanalysis offers much in exploring this doubly tendential dynamic (cf. Jessop 2001). \n \nSubstantively, at what orthodox economics misleadingly describes as the macro-\nlevel, CPE distinguishes the \u2018actually existing economy\u2019 as the chaotic sum of all \neconomic activities (broadly defined as concerned with the social appropriation and \ntransformation of nature for the purposes of material provisioning)4 from the \n'economy' (or, better, 'economies' in the plural) as an imaginatively narrated, more or \nless coherent subset of these activities. The totality of economic activities is so \nunstructured and complex that it cannot be an object of calculation, management, \ngovernance, or guidance. Instead such practices are always oriented to subsets of \neconomic relations (economic systems or subsystems) that have been discursively \nand, perhaps organizationally and institutionally, fixed as objects of intervention. This \ninvolves \u2018economic imaginaries\u2019 that rely on semiosis to constitute these subsets. \nMoreover, if they are to prove more than \u2018arbitrary, rationalistic, and willed\u2019 (Gramsci \n1971: 376-7), these imaginaries must have some significant, albeit necessarily \npartial, correspondence to real material interdependencies in the actually existing \neconomy and\/or in relations between economic and extra-economic activities. These \nsubsets are always selectively defined \u2013 due both to limited cognitive capacities and \n 5\nto the discursive and material biases of specific epistemes and economic paradigms. \nThey typically exclude elements \u2013 usually unintentionally \u2013 that are vital to the overall \nperformance of the subset of economic (and extra-economic) relations that have \nbeen identified. Such exclusions limit in turn the efficacy of economic forecasting, \nmanagement, planning, guidance, governance, etc., because such practices do not \n(indeed, cannot) take account of excluded elements and their impact. Similar \narguments would apply, with appropriate changes, to so-called meso- or micro-level \neconomic phenomena, such as industrial districts or individual enterprises. \n \nImagined economies are discursively constituted and materially reproduced on many \nsites and scales, in different spatio-temporal contexts, and over various spatio-\ntemporal horizons. They extend from one-off transactions through stable economic \norganizations, networks, and clusters to \u2018macro-economic\u2019 regimes. While massive \nscope for variation typically exists at an individual transactional level, the medium- to \nlong-term semiotic and material reproduction requirements of meso-complexes and \nmacro-economic regimes narrow this scope considerably. The recursive selection of \nsemiotic practices and extra-semiotic processes at these scales tends to reduce \ninappropriate variation and to secure thereby the \u2018requisite variety\u2019 (constrained \nheterogeneity rather than simple uniformity) that supports the structural coherence of \neconomic activities. Indeed stable semiotic orders, discursive selectivities, social \nlearning, path-dependencies, power relations, patterned complementarities, and \nmaterial selectivities all become more significant, the more that material \ninterdependencies and\/or issues of spatial and intertemporal articulation increase \nwithin and across diverse functional systems and the lifeworld. Yet this growing set \nof constraints also reveals the fragility and, indeed, improbability of the smooth \nreproduction of complex social orders. This highlights the importance of retaining an \nappropriate repertoire of semiotic and material resources and practices that can be \nflexibly and reflexively deployed in response to emerging disturbances and crises (cf. \nGrabher 1994; Jessop 2003).  \n \nEconomic imaginaries at the meso- and macro-levels develop as economic, political, \nand intellectual forces seek to (re)define specific subsets of economic activities as \nsubjects, sites, and stakes of competition and\/or as objects of regulation and to \narticulate strategies, projects and visions oriented to these imagined economies. \n 6\nAmong the main forces involved in such efforts are political parties, think tanks, \nbodies such as the OECD and World Bank, organized interests such as business \nassociations and trade unions, and social movements; the mass media are also \ncrucial intermediaries in mobilizing elite and\/or popular support behind competing \nimaginaries.5 These forces tend to manipulate power and knowledge to secure \nrecognition of the boundaries, geometries, temporalities, typical economic agents, \ntendencies and counter-tendencies, distinctive overall dynamic, and reproduction \nrequirements of different imagined economies (Daly 1991; Miller and Rose 1993). \nThey also seek to develop new structural and organizational forms that will help to \ninstitutionalize these boundaries, geometries, and temporalities in an appropriate \nspatio-temporal fix that can displace and\/or defer capital\u2019s inherent contradictions \nand crisis-tendencies. However, by virtue of competing economic imaginaries, \ncompeting efforts to institute them materially, and an inevitable incompleteness in \nthe specification of their respective economic and extra-economic preconditions, \neach 'imagined economy' is only ever partially constituted. There are always \ninterstitial, residual, marginal, irrelevant, recalcitrant and plain contradictory elements \nthat escape any attempt to identify, govern, and stabilize a given 'economic \narrangement' or broader 'economic order' (Malpas and Wickham 1995;Jessop 2002).  \n \nNonetheless, relatively successful economic imaginaries do have their own, \nperformative, constitutive force in the material world.6 On the one hand, their \noperation presupposes a substratum of substantive economic relations and \ninstrumentalities as their elements; on the other, where an imaginary is successfully \noperationalized and institutionalized, it transforms and naturalizes these elements \nand instrumentalities into the moments of a specific economy with specific emergent \nproperties. For economic imaginaries identify, privilege, and seek to stabilize some \neconomic activities from the totality of economic relations and transform them into \nobjects of observation, calculation, and governance. Technologies of economic \ngovernance, operating sometimes more semiotically, sometimes more materially,7 \nconstitute their own objects of governance rather than emerging in order to, or \noperating with the effect that, they govern already pre-constituted objects (Jessop \n1990, 1997). Section three illustrates this with a case study of the KBE.  \n \n \n 7\n2. The Dialectic between Semiotic and Structural Selectivities \n \nCPE is not only concerned with how texts produce meaning and thereby help to \ngenerate social structure but also how such production is constrained by emergent, \nnon-semiotic features of social structure as well as by inherently semiotic factors. \nAlthough every social practice is semiotic (insofar as practices entail meaning), no \nsocial practice is reducible to semiosis. Semiosis is never a purely intra-semiotic \nmatter without external reference and involves more than the play of differences \namong networks of signs. It cannot be understood without identifying and exploring \nthe extra-semiotic conditions that make semiosis possible and secure its effectivity \u2013 \nthis includes both the overall configuration of specific semiotic action contexts and \nthe complexities of the natural and social world in which any and all semiosis occurs. \nThis is the basis for the concept of the \u2018economic imaginary\u2019 outlined above. For not \nonly do economic imaginaries provide a semiotic frame for construing economic \n\u2018events\u2019 but they also help to construct such events and their economic contexts. \n \nThe 'play of difference' among signifiers could not be sustained without extensive \nembedding of semiosis in material practice, in the constraints and affordances of the \nmaterial world. Although individual words or phrases do not have a one-to-one \nrelation to the objects to which they refer, the world does still constrain language and \nways of thinking. This occurs over time, if not at every point in time. Not all possible \ndiscursive construals can be durably constructed materially and attempts to realize \nthem materially may have unintended effects (Sayer 2000).8 The relative success or \nfailure of construals depends on how both they and any attempts at construction \ncorrespond to the properties of the materials (including social phenomena such as \nactors and institutions) used to construct social reality. This reinforces my earlier \narguments about the dialectic of discursivity and materiality and the importance of \nboth to an adequate account of the reproduction of political economies. It also \nprovides the basis for thinking about semiosis in terms of variation, selection, and \nretention \u2013 since there is far greater scope for random variation in one-off construals \nthan there is in construals that may facilitate enduring constructions. It is to the \nconditions shaping the selection and retention of construals that we now turn. \n \n 8\nSocial structuration and, a fortiori, the structuring of capitalist social formations, have \nthree general semiotic aspects. First, semiotic conditions affect the differential \nreproduction and transformation of social groups, organizations, institutions, and \nother social phenomena. Second, they also affect the variation, selection and \nretention of the semiotic features of social phenomena. And, third, semiotic \ninnovation and emergence is a source of variation that feeds into social \ntransformation. In short, semiosis can generate variation, have selective effects, and \ncontribute to the differential retention and\/or institutionalization of social phenomena. \n \nTaking for granted the general principles of critical semiotic analysis to focus on \nbroader evolutionary and institutional issues in political economy, we can note that \nthere is constant variation, witting or unwitting, in apparently routine social practices. \nThis poses questions about the regularization of practices in normal conditions and \nabout possible sources of radical transformation, especially in periods of crisis. The \nlatter typically lead to profound cognitive and strategic disorientation of social forces \nand a corresponding proliferation in discursive interpretations and proposed material \nsolutions. Nonetheless the same basic mechanisms serve to select and consolidate \nradically new practices and to stabilize routine practices. Simplifying the analysis of \nevolutionary mechanisms given in Fairclough et al. (2003) and extending it to include \nmaterial as well as semiotic factors, these mechanisms can be said to comprise: \na) Selection of particular discourses (the privileging of just some available, \nincluding emergent, discourses) for interpreting events, legitimizing actions, \nand (perhaps self-reflexively) representing social phenomena. Semiotic \nfactors operate here by influencing the resonance of discourses in personal, \norganizational and institutional, and broader meta-narrative terms and by \nlimiting possible combinations of semiosis and semiotic practices in a given \nsemiotic order. Material factors also operate here through conjunctural or \ninstitutionalized power relations, path-dependency, and structurally-inscribed \nselectivities. \nb) Retention of some resonant discourses (e.g., inclusion in an actor\u2019s habitus, \nhexis, and personal identity, enactment in organizational routines, integrated \ninto institutional rules, objectification in the built environment, material and \nintellectual technologies, and articulation into widely accepted accumulation \nstrategies, state projects, or hegemonic visions). The greater the range of \n 9\nsites (horizontally and vertically)9 in which resonant discourses are retained, \nthe greater is the potential for effective institutionalization and integration into \npatterns of structured coherence and durable compromise. The constraining \ninfluences of complex, reciprocal interdependences will also recursively \naffect the scope for retaining resonant discourses.  \nc) Reinforcement insofar as procedural devices exist that privilege these \ndiscourses and their associated practices and also filter out contrary \ndiscourses and practices. This can involve both discursive selectivity (e.g., \ngenre chains, styles, identities) and material selectivity (e.g., the privileging \nof certain dominant sites of discourse in and through structurally-inscribed \nstrategic selectivities of specific organizational and institutional orders). Such \nmechanisms recursively strengthen appropriate genres, styles, and \nstrategies and selectively eliminate inappropriate alternatives and are most \npowerful where they operate across many sites in a social formation to \npromote complementary discourses within the wider social ensemble. \nd) Selective recruitment, inculcation, and retention by relevant social groups, \norganizations, institutions, etc., of social agents whose predispositions fit \nmaximally with requirements the preceding requirements. \n \nThis list emphasizes the role of semiosis and its material supports in securing social \nreproduction through the selection and retention of mutually supportive discourses. \nConversely, the absence or relative weakness of one or more of these semiotic \nand\/or extra-semiotic conditions may undermine previously dominant discourses \nand\/or block the selection and retention of appropriate innovative discourses. This \nabsence or weakness is especially likely in periods of profound disorientation due to \nrapid social change and\/or crises that trigger major semiotic and material innovations \nin the social world. We should perhaps note here that the semiotic and extra-\nsemiotic space for variation, selection, and retention is contingent, not pre-given. \nThis also holds for the various and varying semiotic and material elements whose \nselection and retention occurs in this \u2018ecological\u2019 space. In a complex world there are \nmany sites and scales on which such evolutionary processes operate and, for \npresent purposes, what matters is how local sites and scales come to be articulated \nto form more global (general) sites and scales and how the latter in turn frame, \nconstrain, and enable local possibilities (Wickham 1987). These interrelations are \n 10\nthemselves shaped by the ongoing interaction between semiotic and extra-semiotic \nprocesses. To illustrate these arguments, I now introduce the concept of a \u2018semiotic \norder\u2019 (Fairclough 2003),10 define the \u2018economic imaginary\u2019 as such an order, and \nexemplify this from the \u2018KBE\u2019 case. \n \nA semiotic order is a specific configuration of genres, discourses and styles and, as \nsuch, constitutes the semiotic moment of a network of social practices in a given \nsocial field, institutional order, or wider social formation.11 Genres are ways of acting \nand interacting viewed in their specifically semiotic aspect and, as such, serve to \nregularize (inter)action. A call-centre script is an example. Discourses represent \nother social practices (and themselves too) as well as the material world from \nparticular positions in the social world. A case in point would be a particular political \ndiscourse, such as the \u2018third way\u2019 (New Labour). Styles are ways of being, identities \nin their specifically semiotic (as opposed to bodily\/material) aspect. The \u2018new\u2019 \nmanagerial style described by Boltanski and Chiapello is one instance (1999). \nGenres, discourses and styles are dialectically related. Thus discourses may \nbecome enacted as genres and inculcated as styles and, in addition, get \nexternalized in a range of objective social and\/or material facts (e.g., second nature, \nphysical infrastructure, new technologies, new institutional orders). The \u2018KBE\u2019 can be \nread as a distinctive semiotic order that (re-)articulates various genres, discourses, \nand styles around a novel economic strategy, state project, and hegemonic vision \nand that affects diverse institutional orders and the lifeworld. \n \n3. Integrating Critical Semiotic Analysis into Political Economy \n \nI now consider the eventual emergence of the \u2018KBE\u2019 as the hegemonic economic \nimaginary in response to the interlinked crises of the mass production-mass \nconsumption regimes of Atlantic Fordism, the exportist growth strategies of East \nAsian national developmental states, and the import-substitution industrializing \nstrategies of Latin American nations. What caused these complex, multi-centric, \nmulti-scalar, and multi-temporal crises is not considered here (see Jessop 2002); \ninstead I focus on the trial-and-error search to identify an appropriate response to \nthese crises. A good starting point is Gramsci\u2019s commentary on an analogous period, \nthe crisis of liberalism, in his notes on 'Americanism and Fordism' (1971). He \n 11\nindicated that the emergence and consolidation of a new economic regime (mercato \ndeterminato) with its own distinctive economic laws or regularities (regolarit\u00e0) does \nnot occur purely through technological innovation coupled with relevant changes in \nthe labour process, enterprise forms, forms of competition, and other narrowly \neconomic matters. More is required. It also depends critically on institutional \ninnovation intended to reorganize an entire social formation and the exercise of \npolitical, intellectual, and moral leadership. One aspect of this is, to use my term, a \nnew 'economic imaginary'. This enables the re-thinking of social, material, and \nspatio-temporal relations among economic and extra-economic activities, institutions, \nand systems and their encompassing civil society. And, to be effective, it must, \ntogether with associated state projects and hegemonic visions, be capable of \ntranslation into a specific set of material, social, and spatio-temporal fixes that jointly \nunderpin a relative 'structured coherence' to support continued accumulation. If this \nproves impossible, the new project will prove \u2018arbitrary, rationalistic, and willed\u2019 \nrather than \u2018organic\u2019 (Gramsci 1971: 376-7). \n \nThis approach implies that crisis is never a purely objective process or moment that \nautomatically produces a particular response or outcome. Instead a crisis emerges \nwhen established patterns of dealing with structural contradictions, their crisis-\ntendencies, and dilemmas no longer work as expected and, indeed, when continued \nreliance thereon may even aggravate the situation. Crises are most acute when \ncrisis-tendencies and tensions accumulate across several interrelated moments of \nthe structure or system in question, limiting room for manoeuvre in regard to any \nparticular problem. Changes in the balance of forces mobilized behind and across \ndifferent types of struggle also have a key role in intensifying crisis-tendencies and in \nweakening and\/or resisting established modes of crisis-management (Offe 1984: 35-\n64). This creates a situation of more or less acute crisis, a potential moment of \ndecisive transformation, and an opportunity for decisive intervention. In this sense, a \ncrisis situation is unbalanced: it is objectively overdetermined but subjectively \nindeterminate (Debray 1973: 113). And this creates the space for determined \nstrategic interventions to significantly redirect the course of events as well as for \nattempts to 'muddle through' in the (perhaps forlorn) hope that the situation will \nresolve itself in time. In short, crises are potentially path-shaping moments.  \n \n 12\nSuch path-shaping is mediated semiotically as well as materially. Crises encourage \nsemiotic as well as strategic innovation. They often prompt a remarkable proliferation \nof alternative visions rooted in old and new semiotic systems and semiotic orders. \nMany of these will invoke, repeat, or re-articulate established genres, discourses, \nand styles; others may develop, if only partially, a \u2018poetry for the future\u2019 that \nresonates with new potentialities (Marx 1852\/1996: 32-34). Which of the proliferating \nalternatives, if any, is eventually retained and consolidated is mediated in part \nthrough discursive struggles to define the nature and significance of the crisis and \nwhat might follow from it. If the crisis can be interpreted as a crisis in the existing \neconomic order, then minor reforms and a passive revolution will first be attempted \nto re-regularize that order. If this fails and\/or if the crisis is already interpreted initially \nas a crisis of the existing economic order, a discursive space is opened to explore \nmore radical changes. In both cases conflicts also concern how the costs of crisis-\nmanagement get distributed and the best policies to escape from the crisis.  \n \nIn periods of major social restructuring, diverse economic, political, and socio-cultural \nnarratives may intersect as they seek to give meaning to current problems by \nconstruing them in terms of past failures and future possibilities. Different social \nforces in the private and public domains propose new visions, projects, programmes, \nand policies and a struggle for hegemony grows. The plausibility of these narratives \nand their associated strategies and projects depends on their resonance (and hence \ncapacity to reinterpret and mobilize) with the personal (including shared) narratives \nof significant classes, strata, social categories, or groups affected by the postwar \neconomic and political order. Moreover, although many plausible narratives are \npossible, their narrators will not be equally effective in conveying their messages and \nsecuring support for the lessons they hope to draw. This will depend on the \nprevailing \u2018web of interlocution\u201912 and its discursive selectivities, the organization and \noperation of the mass media, the role of intellectuals in public life, and the structural \nbiases and strategically selective operations of various public and private \napparatuses of economic, political, and ideological domination.13 Such concerns \ntake us well beyond a concern for narrativity and\/or the constraints rooted in specific \norganizational or institutional genres, of course, into the many extra-discursive \nconditions of narrative appeal and of stable semiotic orders. That these institutional \nand metanarratives have powerful resonance does not mean that they should be \n 13\ntaken at face value. All narratives are selective, appropriate some arguments, and \ncombine them in specific ways. In this sense, then, one must consider what is left \nunstated or silent, what is repressed or suppressed in official discourse.  \n \nGiven these general considerations, an effective solution to the search for a \nmeaningful 'post-Fordist' macro-economic order in an increasingly integrated world \nmarket would involve an 'economic imaginary' that satisfies two requirements. First, it \ncan inform and shape economic strategies on all scales from the firm to the wider \neconomy, on all territorial scales from the local through regional to the national or \nsupra-national scale, and with regard to the operation and articulation of market \nforces and their non-market supports. And, second, it can inform and shape state \nprojects and hegemonic visions on different scales, providing guidance in the face of \npolitical and social uncertainty and providing a means to integrate private, \ninstitutional, and wider public narratives about past experiences, present difficulties, \nand future prospects. The more of these fields a new economic imaginary can \naddress, the more resonant and influential it will be.14 This explains the power of the \n\u2018KBE\u2019 as an increasingly dominant and hegemonic discourse that can frame broader \nstruggles over political, intellectual and moral leadership on various scales as well as \nover more concrete fields of technical and economic reform (see table 1). The basic \nidea is being articulated on many scales from local to global, in many organizational \nand institutional sites from firms to states, in many functional systems, such as \neducation, science, health, welfare, law, and politics, as well as the economy in its \nnarrow sense, and in the public sphere and the lifeworld. It has been translated into \nmany different visions and strategies (e.g., smart machines and expert systems, the \ncreative industries, the increasing centrality of intellectual property, lifelong learning, \nthe information society, or the rise of cybercommunities). And it can be inflected in \nneo-liberal, neo-corporatist, neo-statist, and neo-communitarian ways \u2013 often \nseeming to function like a Rorschach inkblot to sustain alliances and institutionalized \ncompromises among very disparate interests.  \n \nTable 1 about here \n \nThe KBE seems to have become a master economic narrative in many accumulation \nstrategies, state projects and hegemonic visions and, through the 1990s, it gained a \n 14\nkey role in guiding and reinforcing activities aiming to consolidate a relatively stable \npost-Fordist accumulation regime and corresponding mode of regulation. Given the \nproliferation of discourses during the emerging crisis in\/of Atlantic Fordism, different \nprocesses were involved in the greater resonance (hence selection) of certain KBE \ndiscourses and subsequent institutionalization (or retention) of relatively coherent \neconomic strategies, political projects, and hegemonic visions oriented to, and \norganized around, the KBE. For there is many a slip between discursive resonance \nin a given conjuncture and an eventual, relatively enduring institutional materiality.  \n \nNonetheless, with all due caution about the frailty of predictions during a transition \nfrom one long wave of capitalist development to another (Perez 2002), it does seem \nthat the KBE has not only been \u2018selected\u2019 from among the many competing \ndiscourses about post-Fordist futures but is now being \u2018retained\u2019 through a complex \nand heterogeneous network of practices across diverse systems and scales of \naction. Whether the KBE also offers a scientifically adequate description of today\u2019s \neconomy in all its chaotic complexity is another matter. But it does correspond in \nsignificant ways to the changes in core technologies, labour processes, enterprise \nforms, modes of competition, and economic \u2018identity politics\u2019 that had begun to \nemerge well before the \u2018KBE\u2019 eventually became hegemonic over other accounts of \nthese changes. And it has since gained a crucial role in consolidating them too \nthrough its capacity to link different sets of ideal and material interests across a \nbroad range of organizations, institutional orders, functional systems, and the \nlifeworld and, for this reason, to provide an overall strategic direction to attempts to \nrespond to new threats and opportunities, material disturbances, and a general \nsense of disorientation in a seemingly ungovernable, runaway world. In short, this is \na discursive construal that has good prospects of translation into material reality. \n \nThe rise of the KBE as a master narrative is not innocent. While it has material and \nideological roots in 1960s debates on post-industrialism, it gained momentum in the \n1980s as American capitalists and state managers sought an effective reply to the \ngrowing competitiveness of their European and East Asian rivals. Various academic \nstudies, think tank reports, and official inquiries indicated that the US was still \ncompetitive in the leading sectors of the 'KBE\u2019. The latter term was an important \ndiscursive innovation in its own right, \u2018re-classifying\u2019 goods, services, industries, \n 15\ncommodity chains, and forms of competitiveness. This research prompted a \nconcerted campaign to develop the material and ideological basis for a new \naccumulation strategy based on the deepening and widening of the KBE and the \nmassive extension of intellectual property rights to protect and enlarge the \ndominance of US capital for the anticipated next long wave. This reflects a neo-\nliberal policy for productive capital that safeguards US superprofits behind the cloak \nof free trade in intellectual property and so complements its neo-liberal policy for \nfinancial capital. The new strategy was translated into a successful hegemonic \ncampaign (armoured by law and juridical precedents, dissemination of US technical \nstandards and social norms of production and consumption, bilateral trade leverage, \ndiplomatic arm-twisting, and bloody-minded unilateralism) to persuade other states \nto adopt the KBE agenda. Indeed, the KBE has been warmly embraced as a master \nnarrative and strategy by other leading political forces \u2013 ranging from international \nagencies (notably the OECD and WTO but also the IMF, World Bank, and UNCTAD) \nthrough regional economic blocs and intergovernmental arrangements (e.g., EU, \nAPEC, ASEAN, Mercosur, NAFTA) and individual national states with different roles \nin the global division of labour (e.g., New Zealand, South Korea, Germany, \nColombia) down to a wide range of provinces, metropolitan regions, and small cities.  \n \nLike Fordism as a master narrative and strategy before it, the 'KBE' can be inflected \nto suit different national and regional traditions and different economic interests. It \ncan also be used to guide economic and political strategies at all levels from the \nlabour process through the accumulation regime and its mode of regulation to an all-\nembracing mode of societalization. Moreover, once accepted as the master narrative \nwith all its nuances and scope for interpretation, it becomes easier for its neo-liberal \nvariant to shape the development of the emerging global knowledge-based economy \nthrough the sheer weight of the US economy as well as through the exercise of \neconomic, political, and intellectual domination.  \n \nThis said, there is certainly scope for counter-hegemonic versions of the KBE and \ndisputes about how best to promote it. This can be seen in the new international \ncompetitiveness benchmarking exercises conducted by the World Economic Forum \nfrom 1998 onwards, with the neo-liberal USA and neo-corporatist Finland alternating \nas number one for four years (see Porter et al., 2000; World Economic Forum \n 16\n2002).15 Similarly, at its Lisbon summit in 2000, the European Union aimed to \nbecome the leading KBE in the world whilst protecting the European Social Model \nand developing modes of meta-governance based on social partnership rather than \npure market forces (Tel\u00f2 2002). The space available within the KBE discourse for \nsuch disputes helps to reproduce the overall discourse within which they are framed.  \n \n4. Concluding Remarks \n \nThis article argues for sustained theoretical and empirical engagement between a \nmaterially-grounded critical semiotic analysis and an evolutionary and institutional \npolitical economy informed by the cultural turn. It is based on my earlier work on \nstate theory and political economy and my critical engagement with Marx\u2019s pre-\ntheoretical discourse analysis16 and Gramsci\u2019s elaborate philological and materialist \nstudies of hegemony. Others have taken different routes to similar conclusions and \nhave used other labels to describe them. What most distinguishes CPE as presented \nhere from apparently similar approaches are the application of evolutionary theory to \nsemiosis as well as political economy and their resulting mutual transformation. \n \nI conclude with the following remarks. First, insofar as semiosis is studied apart from \nits extra-semiotic context, resulting accounts of social causation will be incomplete, \nleading to semiotic reductionism and\/or imperialism. And, second, insofar as material \ntransformation is studied apart from its semiotic dimensions and mediations, \nexplanations of stability and change risk oscillating between objective necessity and \nsheer contingency. To avoid these twin problems, CPE aims to steer a path between \n'soft cultural economics\u2019 and 'hard orthodox economics'. While the former subsumes \neconomic activities under broad generalizations about social and cultural life \n(especially their inevitably semiotic character), the latter reifies formal, market-\nrational, calculative activities and analyzes them apart from their discursive \nsignificance and broader extra-economic context and supports. The former tendency \nis common in economic sociology or claims about the \u2018culturalization\u2019 of economic \nlife in the new economy (e.g., Lash and Urry 1994); it also occurs in more discourse-\ntheoretical work, such as work on cultural materialism (Williams 1980; Milner 2002), \nthe linguistic mediation of economic activities (Gal 1989), or economic antagonisms \n(Laclau and Mouffe 1985). Unfortunately, from my viewpoint, while such currents \n 17\ncorrectly reject a sharp division between the cultural and material and stress the \ncultural dimensions of material life, they tend to lose sight of the specificity of \ndifferent economic forms, contradictions, institutions, contradictions, and so on. The \nrisk here is that one cannot distinguish in material terms between capitalist and non-\ncapitalist economic practices, institutions, and formations \u2013 they all become equally \ndiscursive and can only be differentiated through their respective semiotic practices, \nmeanings, and contexts and their performative impact. Conversely, \u2018hard orthodox \neconomics\u2019 tends to establish a rigid demarcation between the economic and the \ncultural, reifying economic objects, naturalizing homo economicus, and proposing \nrigid economic laws. At its most extreme, this leads to universalizing, transhistorical \nclaims valid for all forms of material provisioning; in other cases, it tends to separate \neconomizing activities from their extra-economic supports, to regard the economy as \na self-reproducing, self-expanding system with its own laws, and to provide the \ntheoretical underpinnings for economic reductionism. \n \nIn offering a \u2018third way\u2019, CPE, at least as presented here, emphasizes that capitalism \ninvolves a series of specific economic forms (the commodity form, money, wages, \nprices, property, etc.) associated with generalized commodity production. These \nforms have their own effects that must be analyzed as such and that therefore shape \nthe selection and retention of competing economic imaginaries. Thus a Marxist CPE \nwould robustly reject the conflation of discourses and material practices and the \nmore general 'discourse-imperialism' that has plagued social theory for two decades. \nIt would also provide a powerful means both to critique and to contextualize recent \nclaims about the \u2018culturalization\u2019 of economic life in the new economy \u2013 seeing these \nclaims as elements within a new economic imaginary with a potentially performative \nimpact as well as a belated (mis)recognition of the semiotic dimensions of all \neconomic activities (for sometimes contrasting views, see Du Gay and Pryke 2002; \nRay and Sayer 1999). And, in addition, as many theorists have noted in various \ncontexts (and orthodox Marxists sometimes forget), the reproduction of the basic \nforms of the capital relation and their particular instantiation in different social \nformations cannot be secured purely through the objective logic of the market or a \ndomination that operates \u2018behind the backs of the producers\u2019. For capital\u2019s laws of \nmotion are doubly tendential and depend on contingent social practices that extend \nwell beyond what is from time to time construed and\/or constructed as economic. \n 18\nCPE provides a corrective to these problems too. In part this comes from its \nemphasis on the constitutive material role of the extra-economic supports of market \nforces. But it also emphasizes how different economic imaginaries serve to \ndemarcate economic from extra-economic activities, institutions, and orders and, \nhence, how semiosis is also constitutive in securing the conditions for capital \naccumulation. \n \nReferences \n \nArcher, M.

The usual disclaimers apply. \n2 On CPE, see Jessop and Sum (2001). \n3 While semiosis initially refers to the inter-subjective production of meaning, it is also \n 24\n                                                                                                                                                        \nan important element\/moment of \u2018the social\u2019 more generally. Semiosis involves more \nthan (verbal) language, including, for example, different forms of \u2018visual language\u2019.  \n4 Polanyi (1982) distinguishes (a) substantive economic activities involved in material \n'provisioning' from (b) formal (profit-oriented, market-mediated) economic activities. \nThe leading economic imaginaries in capitalist societies tend to ignore the full range \nof substantive economic activities in favour of certain formal economic activities. \n5 I am not suggesting here that mass media can be completely disentangled from the \nbroader networks of social relations in which they operate but seeking to highlight \nthe diminished role of an autonomous public sphere in shaping semiosis.  \n6 Indeed, there is no economic imaginary without materiality (Bayart 1994: 20-1). \n7 Although all practices are semiotic and material, the relative causal efficacy of \nthese elements will vary. \n8 On the pre-linguistic and material bases of logic, see Archer (2000). \n9 Horizontal refers here to sites on a similar scale (e.g., personal, organizational, \ninstitutional, functional systems) and vertical refers to different scales (e.g., micro-\nmacro, local-regional-national-supranational-global). The use of both terms must be \nrelative and relational. \n10 Semiotic orders are equivalent to \u2018orders of discourse\u2019 in Fairclough (1992). \n11 This paragraph draws directly and extensively on Fairclough (2003). \n12  A web of interlocution comprises metanarratives that reveal linkages between a \nwide range of interactions, organizations, and institutions and\/or help to make sense \nof whole epochs (Somers 1994: 614). \n13 On discursive selectivity, see Hay 1996 and Somers 1994; on structural selectivity, \nsee Jessop 1990. \n14 My strategic-relational approach is consistent with this claim but also emphasizes \nthat constraints are relative to specific actors, identities, interests, strategies, spatial \nand temporal horizons, etc. (see Jessop 2002). \n15 Neo-statist Singapore \u2018won\u2019 second place in 2003, after the USA, before Finland. \n16 On this, see Graham and Fairclough (2000). \n"}
