Rhyolitic magma in 42 \nIceland is primarily found within or close to central volcanoes that have been active 43 \nfor 0.5 to 2.5 Ma (S\u00e6mundsson 1978; Gunnarsson et al. 1998). In large central 44 \nvolcanoes (\u2265 400 km3) such as Torfaj\u00f6kull they can make up to 20-30% of the 45 \nexposed rocks and >50% of the central portion (Walker 1963; Gunnarsson et al. 46 \n1998). 47 \n 48 \nSamples analysed in this study are sourced from two central volcanoes, Torfaj\u00f6kull 49 \nand Krafla, and reflect a broad range of volcanic lithofacies that include obsidian 50 \n 2\nlavas and variably altered fragmental deposits. We use the term alteration as defined 51 \nby McPhie et al. (1993) i.e. the change in mineralogy and texture of a deposit, 52 \nfacilitated by the action of hot or cold aqueous solutions or gases. In many volcanic 53 \nterranes the processes of diagenetic and hydrothermal alteration are inseparable and 54 \ninvolve dissolution, replacement and precipitation of minerals along fluid pathways 55 \n(Noh and Boles 1989). Volcanic glasses of dacitic and rhyolitic compositions (Noh 56 \nand Boles 1989; Drysdale 1991) can be altered by hydration to form the industrially 57 \nimportant commodity perlite, which is volcanic glass hosting abundant delicate, 58 \nintersecting and gently curved cracks surrounding cores of intact glass (McPhie et al. 59 \n1993). Perlitised obsidian is also water-rich; studies of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes 60 \nhave shown this is due to diffusion of meteoric water into the glass and not a water-61 \nrich original magma (Ross and Smith 1955; Friedman and Smith 1958, 1960; 62 \nMarshall 1961; Friedman et al. 1966). The meteoric water is re-introduced as 63 \nmolecular water or hydroxyl groups depending on total water content and temperature 64 \nof hydration (Stolper 1982; Sodeyama et al. 1999; Roulia et al. 2006). Whether the 65 \ndiffusion of water results in the cracks or crack formation facilitates the diffusion of 66 \nwater is still unresolved (Marshall 1961; Friedman et al. 1966). 67 \n 68 \nThe further alteration of perlitised obsidian occurs through glass dissolution and 69 \nsmectite crystallisation along the perlitic cracks. It manifests itself in a colour change 70 \nfrom dark grey to dull brown or green (Noh and Boles 1989). As alteration proceeds 71 \nglass dissolution and smectite crystallisation increases inwards from the cracks 72 \neventually resulting in the central bead of remnant glass being completely dissolved. 73 \nThis alteration pathway is assumed to be appropriate for perlite derived from obsidian 74 \nof rhyolitic composition however the alteration minerals produced are likely to be 75 \ndifferent (Bagdassarov et al. 1999). 76 \n 77 \nRoulia et al. (2006) conducted thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of perlitic samples 78 \nfrom Milos Island, Greece, measuring sample mass loss under a controlled heating 79 \nprogram. They found that the proportion of mass lost at low temperatures (0-250 \u00baC; 80 \nthought to be molecular water) increased when longer isotherms were incorporated 81 \ninto the experimental method. Bagdassarov et al. (1999) showed, through TGA and 82 \ndifferential thermal analysis (DTA) experiments on perlite glasses, that heat input 83 \nbetween 150 and 200 \u00baC was mainly used to vapourise water without driving it from 84 \nthe sample. They described the first peak of a time derivative of the TGA signal as the 85 \ncharacteristic temperature of glass dehydration (Bagdassarov et al. 1999).  86 \n 87 \nGaining insights into how perlite forms is valuable because it may provide clues of 88 \nthe environment of eruption, in particular the environment of magma-water 89 \ninteraction (e.g. Davis and McPhie 1996; Tuffen et al. 2001). The minerals which 90 \nhave grown in the perlitic fractures may reflect the chemistry of aqueous solutions or 91 \ngases present post-eruption. Studying the hydration and alteration of volcanic material 92 \nis important because this is a stage in the soil forming process. 93 \n 94 \nWe present the first study of volatile contents and thermal characteristics of a suite of 95 \nsamples showing varying degrees of alteration from pristine obsidians, through 96 \nperlites, to highly altered cemented breccias. Other TGA studies on perlite (e.g. 97 \nBagdassarov et al. 1999; Roulia et al. 2006) were not carried out on samples from 98 \nsuch well-constrained geological settings. The samples analysed in this study are 99 \n 3\nsourced from locations where the environment of eruption is relatively well-100 \nestablished. 101 \n 102 \n 103 \nLocalities 104 \n 105 \nSamples were analysed from three localities within the Torfaj\u00f6kull central volcano: 106 \nBl\u00e1hn\u00fakur, SE-Rau\u00f0fossafj\u00f6ll and Dalakv\u00edsl (Figure 1). Additional samples were 107 \nanalysed from Hrafntinnuhryggur. Krafla central volcano (Figure 2). A brief overview 108 \nof the geology of the four localities follows. 109 \n 110 \nTorfaj\u00f6kull central volcano is the largest active silicic centre in Iceland (Tuffen et al. 111 \n2001) where >80% of outcrops are silicic in composition (Gunnarsson et al. 1998). 112 \nEruptions during glacial periods have resulted in a series of subglacial and 113 \nsubaqueous silicic formations with subaerial lavas also present (McGarvie 1984; 114 \nTuffen et al. 2001). 115 \n 116 \nBl\u00e1hn\u00fakur (Figure 1) formed in a small-volume effusive subglacial eruption during 117 \nthe last glacial period (115-11 ka ago). Deposits are dominated by irregular- to 118 \ncylindrical-shaped obsidian (sometimes perlitised) and microcrystalline rhyolite lobes 119 \nin a pale grey perlitised hyaloclastite breccia. Other facies include matrix- and clast-120 \nsupported breccias and columnar-jointed lava flows (Tuffen et al. 2001). 121 \n 122 \nRau\u00f0fossafj\u00f6ll was formed in a larger-volume, more explosive, subglacial eruption 123 \nthan Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur and occurred at ~60 ka. The best exposure is on the SE tuya (a steep-124 \nsided subglacially erupted volcano with a flat top of subaerially erupted lava 125 \n(Mathews 1947)) (Figure 1; SE-R) and it is from here that the samples analysed were 126 \nsourced (Tuffen et al. 2002). The lower portion of the tuya is dominated by fine-127 \ngrained ash facies and the summit is capped by a subaerial rhyolite lava flows (Tuffen 128 \net al. 2002). 129 \n 130 \nThe Dalakv\u00edsl rhyolite formation occurs north-east of Rau\u00f0fossafj\u00f6ll (Figure 1) and is 131 \ngeochemically similar to the tuyas, so thought to be contemporaneous at ~60 ka 132 \n(Tuffen et al. 2008). The formation includes both explosive and effusive deposits 133 \nincluding breccias and lavas. The dominant lithology is a massive obsidian and 134 \npumice breccia. Other facies include a highly vesicular pyroclastic deposit, local well-135 \nbedded ash deposits, obsidian (sometimes perlitised) and microcrystalline rhyolite 136 \nlavas and lava lobes as well as peperitic lavas (Tuffen et al. 2008). 137 \n 138 \nKrafla (Figure 2 inset) is a central volcano with a 100-km-long basaltic fissure swarm. 139 \nAt ~24 ka a <0.05 km3 rhyolitic eruption through thin ice formed Hrafntinnuhryggur 140 \n(Obsidian Ridge, CL-1; Figure 2) (Tuffen and Castro 2009). Lithofacies include 141 \nnumerous small-volume perlitic and spherulitic lava bodies set in quench 142 \nhyaloclastites, obsidian scree and strongly altered, perlitic, columnar-jointed obsidian. 143 \nLocally quench-fragmented, perlitic lavas grade outwards into indurated breccia 144 \ncemented by alteration minerals. 145 \n 146 \n 147 \nSamples analysed 148 \n 149 \n 4\nA brief geological description and a summary of the samples analysed is given in 150 \nTable 1. Field observations from the lithofacies can be found in Tuffen et al. (2001) 151 \n(Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur), Tuffen et al. (2002) (Rau\u00f0fossafj\u00f6ll), Tuffen et al. (2008) (Dalakv\u00edsl) 152 \nand Tuffen and Castro (2009) (Hrafntinnuhryggur). 153 \n 154 \nMethods 155 \n 156 \nPetrographic observations 157 \n 158 \nMicro-textural observations were performed using a petrological microscope. The 159 \ndegree of perlitisation was estimated using the relative proportion of arcuate cracks 160 \nand surrounding darker hydrated glass to unhydrated, pale cream glass. 161 \n 162 \nParticle size 163 \n 164 \nThe grainsize distributions of unconsolidated samples were determined by sieving. 165 \nThe percentage of obsidian in each size fraction was also estimated by eye. 166 \n 167 \nVolatile contents 168 \n 169 \nVolatile contents and thermal characteristics of samples were analysed using a TA 170 \nInstruments SDT Q600 simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry \u2013 thermal 171 \ngravimetric analyser (DSC-TGA) instrument coupled to an HPR-20 QIC Gas 172 \nAnalysis System (mass spectrometer, MS) at Lancaster University. The DSC-TGA 173 \ntechnique measures the weight loss and thermal characteristics of a sample while it is 174 \nsubject to a controlled heating program. The addition of the mass spectrometer allows 175 \nthe identification of the exsolved gases. In the current set-up it is not routinely 176 \npossible to resolve H2O from other volatiles such as Cl and F when volatile contents 177 \nare low. Nevertheless, the dominance of H2O over other volatiles e.g. Cl and F in 178 \nvolatile-rich samples is demonstrated in greater counts-per-second by several orders 179 \nof magnitude. During analysis the sample was purged by oxygen-free nitrogen with 180 \nbetter than 99.999% purity at a flux of 50 ml min-1. 181 \n 182 \nEach sample was crushed and sieved. The 125-500 \u00b5m size fraction was washed with 183 \nacetone and then oven-dried at 110 \u00baC for ~1 hour (Newman et al. 1986). After 184 \ndrying, the sample was transferred to a dessicator minimising atmospheric water 185 \nadsorption before analysis. Approximately 30 mg of the sample was placed in a tared 186 \nplatinum cup on the DSC-TGA sample beam and heated at 5 \u00baC min-1 from ambient 187 \ntemperatures to 1250 \u00baC, and then held at this temperature for two hours. The sample 188 \nwas then cooled to ambient temperature and the heating repeated. This enabled 189 \nartefacts inherent to the instrumentation to be removed from the results. Performing a 190 \nsecond heating which recorded no volatile loss, for each sample also confirmed that 191 \nthe heating method employed successfully drove off all the volatiles. Total volatile 192 \nloss (i.e. total volatile content) was calculated by subtracting the second heating 193 \nweight loss from the first heating weight loss. The temperatures of minimum 194 \nheatflow, maximum differential mass loss (dTG) were determined for each sample 195 \n(Figure 3). The maximum MS water signal was also determined for each sample from 196 \nthe assumption that water was the dominant dissolved volatile species (Figure 3). This 197 \nmethod was repeated for at least one duplicate of each sample. 198 \n 199 \n 5\nWe also investigated the effect of grainsize on volatile content in altered fragmental 200 \ndeposits. This was undertaken first for sample D85a from Dalakv\u00edsl (Table 1). The 201 \nsample was sieved into six size fractions (Table 4). Each size fraction was analysed on 202 \nthe DSC-TGA-MS. Samples from Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur (B120a) and SE-Rau\u00f0fossafj\u00f6ll (D-203 \n0016) were also analysed but using only two size fractions from each (Table 4). To 204 \navoid adding unnecessary variables to the experiments the >500 \u00b5m fraction for all 205 \nsamples was crushed to 125-500 \u00b5m as this was the standard size range used for 206 \nvolatile content analyses in this study and by Newman et al. (1986). 207 \n 208 \nSecondary mineral growth 209 \n 210 \nX-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out on 6 samples (Table 5) at the 211 \nUniversity of Edinburgh. The rationale was to investigate whether contrasting 212 \nalteration minerals and concentrations are present for (a) perlites and unconsolidated 213 \nsamples and (b) grey and green units. 214 \n 215 \nSamples were ground to ~50 \u00b5m in an orbital mill; ~2 g of this material was loaded 216 \ninto a micronising mill along with 10 cm3 of de-ionised distilled water and the 217 \nmixture ground for 12 minutes. A few drops of the resulting suspension were then 218 \nplaced onto a glass plate and dried in air, at 60 \u00baC. This preparation method, although 219 \nproducing well-defined diffraction peaks inevitably introduces an unknown but 220 \nsignificant degree of preferred orientation into the samples for those minerals that 221 \nhave platy or rod-like habits, thus increasing the reflections with l\u22600. The effects of 222 \npreferred orientation can be compensated for by the Rietveld analysis package. The 223 \npowder diffraction data were recorded on the Bruker D8 Advance Diffractometer at 224 \nthe School of Geosciences, University of Edinburgh. The amounts of phases present 225 \nwere determined by the Rietveld analysis package Topas 3 in which the observed 226 \ndiffraction pattern is fitted against a synthetic pattern derived from a sum of patterns 227 \ncalculated for each phase present in the sample. The difference between the observed 228 \npattern and the synthetic pattern is minimised by an interactive 229 \nrefinement\/optimisation procedure to derive an estimate of the amounts of the phases 230 \npresent. 231 \n 232 \n 233 \nResults 234 \n 235 \nPetrography 236 \n 237 \nPhotomicrographs of perlitic samples are shown in Figure 4. These samples are 238 \ndescribed briefly in Table 1. The arcuate (perlitic) fractures form complete and 239 \nincomplete beads. The perlitic fractures form from the more prominent 240 \nplanar\/curviplanar fractures which form a boundary around areas of perlitised glass. 241 \nPlanar cracks are wider than the arcuate fractures. Alteration minerals form within 242 \nplanar, curviplanar and arcuate fractures, e.g. the dark colouring of the fractures in 243 \nFigure 4b. 244 \n 245 \nParticle size 246 \n 247 \n 6\nThe grainsize distributions of the hyaloclastites (supplementary material) contain 248 \ninformation on the fragmentation and transport mechanisms involved in the formation 249 \nof the deposit. D-0016 and D85a are skewed to the finer fractions, consistent with a 250 \nquench-generated hyaloclastite (Heiken 1972; Heiken and Wohletz 1985). TCOG-2, 251 \nD-003, D47-7 and B120a are all dominated by coarse particle sizes, indicating 252 \nexplosive generation (Heiken 1972; Heiken and Wohletz 1985). A number of these 253 \nparticles are vesicular (Tuffen 2001; Tuffen et al. 2001; Tuffen et al. 2002; Tuffen et 254 \nal. 2008). D-001 has a dominant size range of 0.5-1.0 mm but is bimodal. It is 255 \ninterpreted to have been formed from quench fragmentation of a subglacial lava lobe 256 \n(Tuffen et al. 2008). This explains the high proportion of obsidian. 257 \n 258 \nVolatile contents 259 \n 260 \nSince the CO2 content of Torfaj\u00f6kull obsidians is negligible (Tuffen et al. 2008) and S 261 \nconcentrations are <100 ppm (Tuffen unpub. data from Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur obsidians), the 262 \nvolatile species present are predominantly H2O (0.1-0.2 wt. %) and halogens (\u22640.5 wt. 263 \n%) (Tuffen unpub. data; Table 2). Halogens are unlikely to be mobilised in the 264 \nhydration process so are likely to contribute no more than 0.4 wt. % to the total 265 \nvolatile concentrations in all samples. These measurements are consistent with our 266 \nmass spectrometer data (CO2 and SO2 levels of counts per second of 10-11 to 10-13 267 \ncompared to ~10-9 for water and no evidence of Na release). Consequently water is by 268 \nfar the dominant volatile species in the altered samples. Therefore the total volatile 269 \ncontent of samples refers to water plus other minor species. The contribution to mass 270 \nloss of these minor species decreases as the amount of hydration\/alteration increases. 271 \n 272 \nTable 3 and Figure 5 present the total volatile contents (wt. %) of all the samples 273 \nanalysed in this study. Totals range from 0.52 wt. % for obsidians to 9.41 wt. % for a 274 \ngreen cemented breccia. The total volatile content of the pristine, subaerial obsidian 275 \nsample TCO-7 measured in this study by TGA (0.52-0.60 wt. %) is closely 276 \ncomparable to the sum of independent measurements of H2O, Cl and F conducted on 277 \nthis sample using FTIR and electron probe (Tuffen unpublished data). As total [Cl + 278 \nF] is typically less than 0.4 wt. % in the Torfaj\u00f6kull obsidians analysed, the total 279 \nvolatile contents of all other samples are therefore dominated by H2O. The subaerial 280 \nobsidian lavas from SE-Rau\u00f0fossafj\u00f6ll and Krafla contain 0.52-0.60 wt. % and 0.44-281 \n0.65 wt. % volatiles respectively. The subglacially erupted obsidian from Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur 282 \nis notably more volatile-rich and the total volatile concentrations are more variable, 283 \nranging from 1.05 \u2013 3.04 wt. %. 284 \n 285 \nThe total volatile contents of the hyaloclastites vary greatly between localities. The 286 \nSE-Rau\u00f0fossafj\u00f6ll hyaloclastites contain between 6.12 and 7.31 wt. % volatiles. 287 \nThose from Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur contain 4.91 to 5.19 wt. % and those from Dalakv\u00edsl between 288 \n3.23 and 8.15 wt. %. This wide range is characterised by a colour change between the 289 \ngrey volatile-poor (3-4 wt. %) and the green volatile-rich (7-8 wt. %) samples. The 290 \ngreen obsidian-breccia from Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur has a total volatile content between 8.49 and 291 \n9.41 wt. %. 292 \n 293 \nThe variable total volatile content of SE-Rau\u00f0fossafj\u00f6ll perlites corresponds to the 294 \ndegree of perlitisation. The GD-2 sample is 25% perlitised and is slightly more 295 \nvolatile-rich (3.60-3.81 wt. %) than PLAT-18 (20% perlitised and 2.15-2.58 wt. %). 296 \nPLAT-18 Bag was analysed using the method of Bagdassarov et al. (1999) and 297 \n 7\nyielded a total volatile content of only 0.39 wt. %. This suggests that Bagdassarov et 298 \nal's (1999) method using our TGA-MS failed to remove all the volatiles from the 299 \nsample due to the absence of vacuum conditions. The Krafla perlite contains 2.47 to 300 \n2.85 wt. % total volatiles which is comparable to PLAT-18 but it is more strongly 301 \nperlitised. The Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur perlites range from 2.15 wt. % to 7.06 wt. %, with the 302 \nperlite that is most volatile-rich (B25a) being the most perlitised (30%) in thin section 303 \nand green in colour. The grey Dalakv\u00edsl perlite (D-0010) is the most perlitised of all 304 \nsamples studied and is the most volatile-rich (90% perlitised with 8.04-8.15 wt. % 305 \nvolatiles). 306 \n 307 \nDSC-TGA analyses 308 \n 309 \nTable 3 presents the endotherm, differential mass loss and MS water signal peak 310 \ntemperatures for the samples analysed (Figure 3). There is considerable variation in 311 \nthe peak temperatures. The empty cells reflect where there was no distinct peak, but 312 \ninstead several smaller peaks. The range in peak temperatures is generally greater for 313 \nthe pristine obsidians than the other samples (Table 3). We think this may reflect the 314 \ndifferent coordination of water within the silicate structure as well as the increased 315 \ncontribution of minor species e.g. Cl and F. Figure 6 shows how the temperature of 316 \nminimum heatflow, peak differential mass loss and MS water signals vary with total 317 \nvolatile content. The scatter is generally greater when volatile contents are low. 318 \nSamples with higher volatile concentrations generally degas at lower temperatures. 319 \n 320 \nGrainsize effect on volatile content 321 \n 322 \nTable 4 shows that the fine grainsize fraction of the Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur and SE-Rau\u00f0fossafj\u00f6ll 323 \nhyaloclastites contain more volatiles than the coarse fraction. The Dalakv\u00edsl 324 \nhyaloclastite shows little variation in total volatile content between different fractions.  325 \n 326 \nXRD analysis 327 \n 328 \nTable 5 presents XRD data for six samples analysed. The alteration minerals detected 329 \nare the zeolites, mordenite ((Ca,K2,N2)Al2Si10O24.7H2O) and heulandite 330 \n(CaAl2Si7O18.6H2O). The proportion of both minerals in the green altered samples is 331 \ngreater than or equal to the grey samples. The exception, heulandite in the perlites, is 332 \napproximately constant within analytical error. The hyaloclastites contain no 333 \nheulandite. Heulandite is softer than mordenite so is thought to have been either 334 \nweathered and removed from the fragmental samples or not to have formed at all. 335 \nB194a contains the greatest proportion of both mordenite and heulandite. B194a is a 336 \nhard, well-consolidated breccia from the eastern flank of Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur that has been 337 \naltered green. Both mordenite and heulandite contain ~14 wt. % H2O (Deer et al. 338 \n1963). The wt. % water held in the zeolite minerals (based on 14% H2O, and the 339 \ncrystalline content of the rock) is compared with the total volatile content of the 340 \nsample (determined by DSC-TGA-MS analysis) (Table 5).  341 \n 342 \n 343 \nDiscussion 344 \n 345 \nThe concentration of magmatic volatiles in non-hydrated glasses is variable and 346 \ndepends on the eruption environment. Subglacially-erupted obsidian from Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur 347 \n 8\n(Figure 5) is notably richer in volatiles than subaerially-erupted obsidian from SE-348 \nRau\u00f0fossafj\u00f6ll and Krafla. This reflects the partial degassing that occurs under 349 \nelevated pressures during subglacial eruptions. Figure 5, Table 1 and Table 3 350 \ndemonstrate that as obsidian becomes more perlitised the total volatile content 351 \nincreases. D-0010 is considered to be the most perlitised obsidian (90%) and is the 352 \nmost volatile-rich (8.04-8.15 wt. %). GD-2 is more perlitised than PLAT-18 (25% and 353 \n20% respectively) and contains more dissolved volatiles (3.60-3.81 wt. % compared 354 \nto 2.15-2.58 wt. %). GD-2 and PLAT-18 are from the same locality confirming that 355 \nperlitisation is driven by water ingress rather than a difference in external factors such 356 \nas eruption type or climate. Conversely the Krafla perlite (CL-1) has similar total 357 \nvolatile contents to PLAT-18 despite being more perlitised. This is because the initial 358 \ntotal volatile content of the Krafla obsidian was much lower than the subglacially 359 \nerupted PLAT-18 (Tuffen et al. 2002; Tuffen and Castro 2009). 360 \n 361 \nOne of the unaltered beads from CL-1 was isolated for volatile analysis and found to 362 \nnot be hydrated (0.44-0.65 wt. % total volatiles; Figure 5, Krafla obsidian). This 363 \nshows that the hydrating water in perlites is concentrated in the altered zones directly 364 \nadjacent to cracks. This corroborates Saisuttichai and Manning (2007) who published 365 \nbulk electron microprobe data from Thai perlitic rhyolites, with total volatile contents 366 \nof 0-3.1 wt. % estimated from loss on ignition. Therefore the \"bulk\" measurement of 367 \nperlite total volatile contents (e.g. Krafla perlite, 2.47 \u2013 2.85 wt. %) depends on the 368 \nproportion of unaltered glass (beads) relative to the sample volume analysed.  369 \n 370 \nThe total volatile contents of the hyaloclastites vary between localities (Figure 5). 371 \nPossible reasons include different eruption types (explosive at SE-Rau\u00f0fossafj\u00f6ll, 372 \neffusive at Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur and mixed at Dalak\u00edsl (Tuffen et al. 2001; Tuffen et al. 2002; 373 \nTuffen et al. 2008)). The factors likely to control the extent of hydration include the 374 \ntimescale and temperature of magma-water interaction during initial fragmentation 375 \nand deposition, the rate of cooling and availability of meltwater after deposition (e.g. 376 \nDrysdale 1991), the grainsize of deposits (discussed below), and subsequent 377 \nreheating, e.g. by lava bodies intruding water-saturated hyaloclastites. Table 4 378 \nconfirms that the extent of hyaloclastite alteration could also be grainsize-dependent. 379 \nThe finer grainsize fraction contains more volatiles than the coarser fraction at 380 \nBl\u00e1hn\u00fakur (B120a) and SE-Rau\u00f0fossafj\u00f6ll (D-0016). The Dalakv\u00edsl hyaloclastite 381 \n(D85a) shows little variation in total volatile contents between different fractions, 382 \nsuggesting equal hydration of all grain sizes. D85a is dominated by fine grainsizes 383 \n(supplementary material) and this is attributed to phreatomagmatism. But could 384 \nexplosive magma-water interaction alone produce the strong hydration in this sample? 385 \nSince phreatomagmatic fragmentation involves rapid quenching and only brief contact 386 \nbetween high-temperature magma and external water substantial post-fragmentation 387 \nhydration probably occurred. The dominant particle size of B120a (supplementary 388 \nmaterial) is skewed towards the coarse grainsizes and thus fragmentation was likely 389 \ndriven by magmatic volatile exsolution. Here, weaker alteration\/hydration could be 390 \ndue to its lower surface area-to-volume ratio, impeding the ingress of water into the 391 \nparticles. D-0016 is dominated by fine grainsizes (supplementary material), indicating 392 \nphreatomagmatic fragmentation, but the finer grainsize fraction is the most volatile-393 \nrich showing that pervasive alteration had not occurred. D-0016 contains more 394 \nobsidian at the finer size fractions, compared to the coarser fractions and to D85a. 395 \nSome of these obsidian particles appear perlitised under a petrological microscope. 396 \nThe perlitisation could account for the volatile enrichment in the finer particles. 397 \n 9\nTherefore the proportion of pristine obsidian a fragmental deposit contains as well as 398 \nthe degree of obsidian perlitisation could be other factors controlling the total volatile 399 \ncontent. 400 \n 401 \nThere is greater scatter between the endotherm, dTG and MS water signal peak 402 \ntemperature data at low volatile contents (Figure 6). This is due to the way the 403 \nvolatiles (mostly water) coordinate with the host structure (Stolper 1982).  The 404 \nrelative concentrations of water species under equilibrium state are dependent on 405 \ntemperature and total water concentration (H2Ot) (Yokoyama et al. 2008). At low 406 \nH2Ot OH dominates over molecular water (H2Om) but the concentration of H2Om 407 \ngradually increases relative to OH as H2Ot increases (Stolper 1982). The scatter 408 \nbetween the peak temperatures is greatest for obsidians (Figure 6) as water counts for 409 \na smaller proportion of the exsolved volatiles and most of the water is magmatic 410 \nwater. Jambon et al. (1992) reported dehydration temperatures of 510-980 \u00baC for 411 \nobsidians containing 0.114 wt. % H2O, indicating a large range over which magmatic 412 \nwater (which is an integral part of the tetrahedral structure) is exsolved. The three 413 \npeak temperatures coincide slightly better for the perlites. Most of the additional water 414 \nat these H2Ot concentrations (2.5-8.15 wt. %), assuming high-temperature hydration, 415 \nwill be bound as silanol groups (Si-OH) (Stolper 1982). The silanol groups are more 416 \nweakly bound than magmatic water and so will break at lower temperatures. The 417 \nhyaloclastites contain, in general, even more water, reflected in an even greater 418 \ncorrespondence between the temperatures of the three peaks (Figure 6). This is due to 419 \nthe increased dominance of weakly bound molecular water (Stolper 1982) which will 420 \nexsolve at a relatively low temperatures (Sodeyama et al. 1999; Roulia et al. 2006) 421 \ncontrolled more by the boiling point of water than the activation energy required to 422 \nbreak bonds. 423 \n 424 \nThe equation of a linear best-fit trend line drawn through the endotherm data (Figure 425 \n6) is TE = -64.176VT + 694.02, with an R2 value of 0.88, where TE is the endotherm 426 \ntemperature and VT the total content. This indicates that a volatile-free glass would 427 \nhave an endotherm at 694 \u00baC, which corresponds well with degassing results for 428 \nobsidian reported by Jambon et al. (1992) and Tg temperatures for Krafla obsidian 429 \n(Castro et al. 2008). When volatile concentrations approach ~9 wt. % exsolution 430 \noccurs at ~100\u00baC (Figure 6). Sample heating at 110 \u00baC was carried out during sample 431 \npreparation to remove any surface water adsorbed during preparation. Such 432 \npreparation could therefore result in some volatile loss from the most altered samples 433 \nprior to TGA analysis. The decreasing temperature of the endotherm of degassing as 434 \nthe total volatile content increases is, we believe, a function of increased 435 \nalteration\/hydration resulting in a greater proportion of H2Om (released at lower 436 \ntemperatures) relative to OH (Stolper, 1982; Sodeyama et al. 1999; Roulia et al. 437 \n2006). 438 \n 439 \nTable 5 shows that the green most volatile-rich samples contain more or equal 440 \nconcentrations of mordenite and heulandite than the grey samples (with the exception 441 \nof the perlitic samples where the heulandite concentrations were constant within 442 \nanalytical error). The degassing temperature of the volatile-rich samples (100-200 \u00b0C, 443 \nFigure 6) is at the lower end of the estimate for the breakdown of heulandite (50-300 444 \n\u00baC) and mordenite (70-630 \u00baC) (Cruchiani 2006). Mordenite is formed preferentially 445 \nover (and often from) heulandite (Kusakabe et al. 1981; Kitsopoulos 1997) at 446 \ntemperatures of 120-400 \u00baC. Therefore the green samples must have been altered at 447 \n 10\ntemperatures between 120 and 400 \u00baC but a substantial amount of the alteration of 448 \nB194a must have occurred below 120 \u00baC due to the presence of heulandite (Kusakabe 449 \net al. 1981; Kitsopoulos 1997). The high total volatile content and greater proportion 450 \nof zeolite minerals of the green coloured samples reflect the influence of relatively 451 \nwater-rich zeolite minerals and hydrothermal activity on the samples. These samples 452 \ncould therefore represent a juvenile soil.  453 \n 454 \nZeolites are found in some andisols and are indicative of the parent material 455 \ncontaining hydrothermally formed material (Ping 2000). Mordenite is usually found 456 \nwith heulandite minerals in hydrothermal areas as an alteration product within 457 \nvolcaniclastic sequences (Kitsopoulos 1997). The strongly altered, zeolite-bearing 458 \nvolatile-rich samples of this study (B194a, B25a and D85a) may all represent juvenile 459 \nandisols. Gennadiev et al. (2007) show that the soil type present in the Torfaj\u00f6kull 460 \narea is a vitrisol (a type of cryand; a common Icelandic andisol). Vitrisols contain 461 \n<1% of organic carbon, support a 5-10% surface vegetation cover and contain 30+% 462 \nof volcanic glass (Gennadiev et al. 2007). Thus, we believe that the volatile-rich green 463 \nsamples in this study represent juvenile soils and the grey perlites represent an 464 \nintermediary stage in the alteration of pristine obsidians to soils. 465 \n 466 \n 467 \nConclusion 468 \n 469 \n(1) The total volatile content of rhyolitic obsidian increases with the degree of 470 \nperlitisation. The results from the perlites reveal that as the degree of perlitisation 471 \nincreases the total volatile content increases, confirming that perlitisation is driven by 472 \nthe ingress of external water. 473 \n 474 \n(2) As the total volatile content increases the temperature of volatile exsolution 475 \ndecreases. The peak degassing temperatures reveal that as the volatile concentration 476 \nincreases the temperature of exsolution decreases. The scatter of the results reflects 477 \nthe way the inwardly diffusing volatiles (water) are bound to the host structure. 478 \n 479 \n(3) A substantial volatile enrichment is often accompanied by secondary mineral 480 \ngrowth. The green volatile-rich samples contain zeolite minerals (mordenite and 481 \nheulandite) which add significant amounts of volatiles to the crystalline proportion of 482 \nthe samples but cannot account for the total volatile enrichment. The presence of 483 \nzeolites suggest these samples represent juvenile soils and that the grey perlites are an 484 \nintermediary between volatile-free obsidian and soils. 485 \n 486 \n 487 \nAcknowledgements 488 \nThanks to two anonymous reviewers and David Pyle for comments that greatly 489 \nimproved the manuscript.
