In the analysis of air, work is focused on the need to collect and characterise ultrafines, i.e. particles below 100 nm in size, and such research is being facilitated through the development of air sampler technologies for subsequent off-line analysis of particles and aerosol mass spectrometric techniques for real-time measurements.
