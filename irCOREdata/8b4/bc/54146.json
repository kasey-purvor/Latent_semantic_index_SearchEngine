INTRODUCTION \nOR practical reasons, digital filters are commonly \nimplemented in hardware using two\u201fs complement \narithmetic for the addition operation. Because of the adder \noverflow, the physical digital filters are actually nonlinear \ndiscrete time systems. Some strange phenomena, such as the \noccurrence of chaotic behaviors when all eigenvalues of the \nsystem matrix being inside the unit circle [1], as well as the \nconvergence of state vectors to some fixed points or the \noccurrence of limit cycle behaviors when all eigenvalues of the \nsystem matrix being outside the unit circle [2]-[3], would occur \nin real digital filters with two\u201fs complement arithmetic. In this \npaper, we would investigate whether these strange phenomena \nwould occur in complex digital filters with two\u201fs complement \n \nManuscript received January 6, 2005; revised June 23, 2005.

The differences between the real and complex digital \nfilters with two\u201fs complement arithmetic are compared. \nFor complex digital filters with two\u201fs complement arithmetic, \nthe order of the system matrices and the number of symbolic \nvariables are doubled, as well as these matrices are no longer \nrealized in the direct form. Hence, all the existing results for real \ndigital filters with two\u201fs complement arithmetic [1]-[4] do not \napply. In fact, behaviors of real and complex digital filters with \ntwo\u201fs complement arithmetic could be very different. For \nexample, it will be shown in this paper that chaotic behavior \nnever occurs if the eigenvalues of the system matrix are inside or \non the unit circle when the system matrix is realized in the \nnormal form, while it was reported in [1]-[4] that chaotic \nbehaviors may occur for same eigenvalues when the system \nmatrix is realized in the direct form. \nRecently, some analysis has been done on second order \ncomplex digital filters with two\u201fs complement arithmetic [5]. In \n[5], a sufficient condition for the asymptotic stability of second \norder digital filters with two\u201fs complement arithmetic, as well as \nbounds on limit cycles, have been derived. Although complex \nsignals were considered in [5], only real filter coefficients were \nconsidered. Also, only fixed point and limit cycle behaviors \nhave been investigated. In this paper, we would generalize the \nanalysis in [5] in such a way that the filter coefficients are \ncomplex, and chaotic behaviors will be explored. \nThe outline for this paper is as follows: the results on the first \norder and second order complex digital filters with two\u201fs \ncomplement arithmetic are, respectively, represented in Section \nII and Section III. Finally, a conclusion is presented in Section \nIV. \nII.

Since \uf028 \uf029 1cos \uf03e\uf02b\uf066\uf071\uf072r  \nbecause of the occurrence of overflow, we have \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n2020\n1 krk xx \uf03d\uf0a3\uf03c\uf02b \uf072\uf072 . For other values of \uf028 \uf0290ks , using \nthe same argument, it can be shown that \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n2020\n1 krk xx \uf03d\uf0a3\uf03c\uf02b \uf072\uf072 . Hence \uf028 \uf029 \uf072nrnk \uf0a3\uf02b\n20\nx  for \n0\uf0b3n . For 1\uf03cr , there exists 00 \uf0b3n  such that 1\n0 \uf03c\uf072nr , so \n\uf028 \uf029 0s \uf03dk  for 00 nkk \uf02b\uf0b3 .

This \ncompletes the proof. \uf06e \nLemma 1 tells us that overflow does not occur at the steady \nstate if 1\uf0a3r , even though it may occur during the transient \nstate. This result is different from that discussed in [1] in which \nchaotic behaviors may occur even though the eigenvalues of \nthese two system matrices are the same. This is because the \noccurrence of nonlinear behaviors depends on the realization of \nthe system. In [1], the system matrix is realized in the direct \nform, while in this paper it is realized in the normal form. \nNow, let\u201fs consider the case when the system matrix is \nunstable. \nLemma 2 \nFor 1\uf03er , there does not exist \uf07b \uf07d00 \uf055\n\uf02b\uf0ceZk , \n\uf02b\uf0ceZM  and \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf07b \uf07d0x \\20 Ik \uf0ce  such that \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029Mkk \uf02b\uf03d ss  for 0kk \uf0b3 . \nProof: \nSuppose \uf07b \uf07d00 \uf055\n\uf02b\uf0ce\uf024 Zk , \n\uf02b\uf0ceZM  and \uf028 \uf029 \uf07b \uf07d0x \\20 Ik \uf0ce  such \nthat \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029Mkk \uf02b\uf03d ss  for 0kk \uf0b3 .

Chaotic case \nWhen \uf028 \uf029ks  is aperiodic, fractal behaviors may exhibit on \nsome phase variables, at the same time, irregular chaotic \nbehaviors may occur in other phase variables. For example, \nwhen 0\uf03dreala , 5.0\uf03dimaga , 1\uf02d\uf03drealb , 0\uf03dimagb  and \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf05b \uf05dT6135.06135.06135.06135.00 \uf02d\uf02d\uf03dx , it can be checked \neasily that if \uf028 \uf029kx1  is plotted against \uf028 \uf029kx4  or \uf028 \uf029kx2  is plotted \nagainst \uf028 \uf029kx3 , then fractal patterns may exhibit on these phase \nportraits. However, random like chaotic patterns are exhibited \non the phase portraits plotting other phase variables. This result \nis also different from that of second order real digital filters with \ntwo\u201fs complement arithmetic [4], in which only fractal patterns \nare exhibited on the phase portrait. This is because there are \nonly two state variables in the system. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor first order complex digital filters with two\u201fs complement \narithmetic, if the eigenvalues of the system matrix are inside or \non the unit circle, then overflow does not occur at the steady \nstate. If the eigenvalues are outside the unit circle, then chaotic \nbehavior would occur. For both cases, limit cycle behavior does \nnot occur. For second order complex digital filters with two\u201fs \ncomplement arithmetic, if all eigenvalues are on the unit circle, \nthen there are two ellipses exhibited on the phase portraits \ncentered at the origin when overflow does not occur. When the \nsymbolic sequences are periodic, the number of ellipses \nexhibited on the phase portraits is no more than two times the \nperiodicity of the symbolic sequences. If the symbolic \nsequences are aperiodic, fractal behaviors may exhibit on some \nphase variables, at the same time, irregular chaotic behaviors \nmay exhibit in other phase variables. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe work obtained in this paper was supported by a research \ngrant (project number G-YD26) from the Hong Kong \nPolytechnic University, and the Centre for Multimedia Signal \nProcessing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Bingo Wing-Kuen Ling, Wai-Fung Hung and Peter Kwong-Shun Tam, \n\u201cChaotic behaviours of stable second-order digital filters with two\u201fs \ncomplement arithmetic,\u201d International Journal of Circuit Theory and \nApplications, vol. 31, no. 6, pp. 541-554, 2003. \n[2] Wing-Kuen Ling and Kwong-Shum Tam, \u201cSome new trajectory patterns \nand periodic behaviors of unstable second-order digital filter with two\u201fs \ncomplement arithmetic,\u201d International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, \nvol. 13, no. 8, pp. 2361-2368, 2003. \n[3] Bingo Wing-Kuen Ling, Charlotte Yuk-Fan Ho, Raymond Shing-Keung \nLeung and Peter Kwong-Shun Tam, \u201cOscillation and convergence \nbehaviours exhibited in an \u201eunstable\u201f second-order digital filter with \nsaturation-type non-linearity,\u201d International Journal of Circuit Theory \nand Applications, vol. 32, no. 2, pp. 57-64, 2004. \n[4] L.
