Introduction \nThe paper will describe the development of GeoSciML (Geoscience Mark-up \nLanguage) as an interoperability standard for geoscience information and its use in the \nOneGeology-Europe project. In particular we will show how both development and \nimplementation have made full use of international geospatial information standards. \nInteroperability is a key element in enabling the Digital Earth vision and the adoption \nof international standards is an essential component in achieving interoperability \n(Nativi, S & Domenico, B, 2009). The development of GeoSciML and its use in the \nOneGeology-Europe project can therefore be seen as important steps towards bringing \ngeoscience information into a future Digital Earth. \n1.1 Background to GeoSciML \nIt is becoming increasingly important to query and exchange geological information \nbetween geological data providers for legal, social, environmental and geoscientific \nreasons. Coincidentally, technological opportunities arising from the evolution of \ngeospatial and geological information standards are making interoperability a viable \nendeavour. \nIn recognition of these trends an Interoperability Working Group (IWG) (CGI, \n2009) was formed under the auspices of the International Union of Geosciences \n(IUGS) Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information \n(CGI), with the aim of developing relevant and timely standards and testing them \nwithin the context of individual data providers, mainly geological surveys. The \ndevelopment of GeoSciML has been a global initiative with active participants in the \nCGI  Interoperability Working Group drawn from Europe, North America, Asia and \nAustralia. The ultimate objective of the working group is to enable seamless web \nintegration of select geoscience information hosted by different data providers in \nvaried formats.  \nMore specific objectives (CGI, 2009) are: \n\u2022 To develop a conceptual model of geoscientific information drawing on existing \ndata models, \n\u2022 To implement an agreed subset of this model in an agreed schema language,  \n\u2022 To implement an XML\/GML1 encoding of the model subset. GML is the \ngrammar defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to express \ngeographical features,  \n                                                \n\u2022 To develop a testbed to illustrate the potential of the data model for interchange,  \n\u2022 To identify areas that require standardised classifications in order to enable \ninterchange. \n \nThe GeoSciML data model has been developed in UML2 from which a \nschema has been generated automatically. In order to test the model a series of use-\n \n1 XML : eXtended Markup Language ; GML : Geography Markup Language \n2 UML : Unified Modeling Language \ncases were developed which were then implemented in web services by the \nGeoSciML partner organisations. All GeoSciML materials, including the GeoSciML \nUML model, XML\/GML schema, instance documents, and full documentation and \n\u2018cookbooks\u2019 to assist users with implementation are available from http:\/\/www.cgi-\niugs.org\/tech_collaboration\/geosciml.html. \nThe development of GeoSciML has been entirely funded by the participating \norganisations through the provision of staff time and the costs of travel and computing \nresources. This approach has the disadvantage that it has excluded some less well \nfunded organisations, but has had the advantage that the development process has not \nbeen constrained by the timescale of a single project or the requirements of external \nfunding organisations. GeoSciML development has been constrained instead by the \nactual use cases and requirements of the participating geological surveys who see \nGeoSciML as necessary to fulfil their role of disseminating geoscience information.  \nThis approach has enabled the IWG to make significant progress in the development \nof GeoSciML since it was formed in 2004. \n1.2 Background to OneGeology-Europe \nThe OneGeology-Europe (EC, 2008) project is a collaboration of twenty-nine \nEuropean organisations, comprising twenty geological surveys and nine academic and \nuser organisations, and is co-funded by the European Union under the eContentplus \nprogramme. OneGeology-Europe has developed from the earlier OneGeology-Global \ninitiative which aims to \u2018Make web-accessible the best available geological map data \nworldwide at a scale of about 1: 1 million, as a geological survey contribution to the \nInternational Year of Planet Earth.' (http:\/\/www.onegeology.org\/home.html). \nOneGeology-Global currently has 113 countries participating and was set up with a \nMemorandum of Understanding (OneGeology, 2007) between the participating \ngeological surveys and UNESCO, the Commission for the Geological Map of the \nWorld (CGMW), the International Union of Geosciences (IUGS), the International \nYear of Planet Earth (IYPE), and the International Steering Committee for Global \nMapping (IGSCGM). OneGeology-Global also uses GeoSciML. \nThe key objectives of OneGeology-Europe (EC, 2008) are to build on the work of \nOneGeology-Global in Europe with the following actions: \n\u2022 To bring together a web-accessible, interoperable geological spatial dataset for the \nwhole of Europe at 1:1 million scale,  \n\u2022 To develop a harmonised specification for basic geological map data and make \nsignificant progress towards harmonising the dataset, \n\u2022 To accelerate the development and deployment of a nascent international \ninterchange standard for geological data \u2013 GeoSciML, \n\u2022 To facilitate re-use and addition of value by a wide spectrum of users and identify, \ndocument and disseminate strategies for the reduction of technical and business \nbarriers to re-use, \n\u2022 To address the multilingual aspects of access through a multilingual discovery \nportal, \n\u2022 To move geological knowledge closer to the end-user. \n \nIn order to meet these objectives the project has identified the following key \ndeliverables: \n\u2022 Use cases and best practice in meeting stakeholder needs, \n\u2022 1:1 million pan-European geological data specification, identification and \nsourcing, \n\u2022 Data inventory and multilingual discovery metadata catalogue, \n\u2022 Informatics specification, data model, interoperability and standards, \n\u2022 Web portal and Registry development and implementation, \n\u2022 Access and licensing protocols, \n\u2022 Communication, dissemination and awareness, \n\u2022 Access to high resolution geological & applied datasets in national & cross border \nsituations, \n\u2022 Liaison with related groups and initiatives. \n \nIt has been decided that the OneGeology-Europe project will use the \nGeoSciML data model and build on the experience gained in developing the \nGeoSciML testbed. It is also an objective of the OneGeology-Europe project to \n\u2018contribute to INSPIRE3\u2019. INSPIRE is an initiative of the European Community \ndesigned to create a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) for Europe,  and in particular to \nenable the sharing of environmental spatial information among public sector \norganisations and better facilitate public access to spatial information across Europe. \nMore information about INSPIRE is available at \nhttp:\/\/inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu\/index.cfm. OneGeology-Europe aims to contribute to \nINSPIRE in the following ways: \n\u2022 Use of ISO 19115\/19119 for services metadata, \n\u2022 Contributing to the INSPIRE geology data specification through use of the \nGeoSciML data model, \n\u2022 Implementation of discovery, view and download services in line with INSPIRE \nrequirements, \n\u2022 Analysis of the data sharing practices of geological surveys across the European \nUnion, \n\u2022 Implementation of web service monitoring. \n \nTo ensure that the spatial data infrastructures of the countries of the European \nUnion are compatible INSPIRE requires that common Implementing Rules (IR) are \nadopted in a number of specific areas including metadata (INSPIRE, 2009 (1)), \ndiscovery services (INSPIRE, 2009 (2)), view services, (INSPIRE, 2009 (3)), and \ndownload services (INSPIRE, 2009 (4)). The general principle that has been adopted \nby OneGeology-Europe is to try to use the INSPIRE implementing rules as much as \npossible. \n2. GeoSciML data model \n2.1 Scope and structure \nThe GeoSciML data model is designed to assist interoperability through a \nstandardisation of the data structure used in geoscience and is built on top of \ninternational standards for data language, such as GML and the W3C4 web systems \n                                                 \n3 INSPIRE: Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community \n4 W3C: World Wide Web Consortium \nstandards. The model draws on pre-existing geoscience data models, in particular the \nNorth Amercian Data Model (NADM) (North American Geologic Map Data Model \nSteering Committee, 2004). The scope of the content of GeoSciML has been \nrestricted in the current version to those geoscience objects which form the main \ncomponents of a geological map: geological units; geologic structures; and earth \nmaterials. It also includes boreholes. In modelling the geological map the concept of \nthe Geologic Feature, which can be either a Geologic Unit or a Geologic Structure, is \ncentral.  \nAn important aspect of the model is that it separates the concept of the Geologic \nFeature, which can be considered a real world object instance the full spatial extent of \nwhich is unknown, from its occurrences which are termed Mapped Features. A typical \ngeological map is made up of Mapped Features which are in turn specified by \nGeologic Features (which are often described in more detail in the map key or a \nrelated stratigraphic lexicon). A single Mapped Feature can be specified by only one \nGeologic Feature, but a Geologic Feature can have several Mapped Feature \noccurrences, on maps of different scales or in a 3D model for example. The main \nfunction of a Mapped Feature therefore is to hold geometry, which it inherits from \nstandard types defined in GML (ISO\/TC 211, 2007 (1)). This pattern contrasts with \nthat of many GIS formats, such as ESRI shapefiles (ESRI, 1998), where geometry and \nattribution are tightly bound. \nThe GeoSciML Boreholes and Observations package re-uses standard \ncomponents from the OGC Observations and Measurements package (Open \nGeospatial Consortium, 2007 (1); Open Geospatial Consortium, 2007 (2)). Boreholes \nare modelled as a special type of SamplingCurve feature but borehole logs can be \ndescribed in two ways in the GeoSciML model \u2013 either as a series of discrete \nObservations down the borehole or as a series of log elements which associate to \nMapped Intervals. Mapped Intervals are a type of Mapped Feature and in this \napproach a borehole can be considered as being akin to a linear geological map. \n2.2 Schematic and semantic interoperability \nThe GeoSciML initiative will put in place the standards to enable the \nschematic interoperability of geoscience data, but semantic interoperability will only \nbe achieved when the data content also conforms to agreed international standards. \nFigure 1 shows where GeoSciML fits within the hierarchy of interoperability. \nGeoSciML is useful even without full semantic interoperability as it enables \nGeological Survey Organisations (GSOs), and other geoscience data providers, to \ndeliver the same type of information to customers in a standard format thus allowing \neasier analysis and processing.  \nThe GeoSciML conceptual model assists in the development of semantic \ninteroperability by identifying those concepts that require standardisation for such \ninteroperability. For example the model has a feature \u2018GeologicEvent\u2019 described by \nthe three properties eventAge, eventEnvironment and eventProcess. The eventAge \nproperty can be encoded using values from the International Commission on \nStratigraphy (ICS) stratigraphic time chart, produced from the geologic time scale \n(Gradstein et al, 2004). This is an example of an internationally agreed set of concept \ndefinitions, and has been implemented in GeoSciML. There is however no agreed set \nof concepts for event age or event process, and this is the case for most geoscience \nproperties. The IWG has therefore set up a Concept Definitions task group to develop \nsimple vocabularies of concepts for such properties, designed specifically for \ninteroperability. It is recognised that these vocabularies are a temporary measure until \nfull concept definitions have been developed by the relevant international geoscience \ncommunities. \n2.3 Use of standards \nA central principle in the development of GeoSciML has been to conform to \nstandards based methodologies published by OGC and ISO. GeoSciML is formally \nspecified by a UML model known as an \u2018application schema\u2019 as defined in ISO 19109 \n(ISO\/TC 211, 2005 (1)). From this model an XML schema is generated which is \nconformant with Geography Markup Language (GML) encoding as defined in ISO \n19136 (ISO\/TC 211, 2007 (1)). GML in turn draws its geometry from the spatial \nschema defined in ISO 19107 (ISO\/TC 211, 2003 (2)) while GeoSciML uses \nmetadata specified by ISO 19115 (ISO\/TC 211, 2003 (1)). For boreholes and outcrops \nGeoSciML draws heavily on the OGC Sampling Features Model (Open Geospatial \nConsortium, 2007 (2)) and the OGC Observation Model (Open Geospatial \nConsortium, 2007 (1)).  \nIt follows from the use by GeoSciML of  existing standards and schema that \nthe CGI Interoperability Working Group is only responsible for maintaining the \ngeology-specific components of GeoSciML. It is intended that GeoSciML will extend \ninto other areas of geoscience as required, but only where these are not already being \nmodelled by other interest groups. Where such related activities exist the aim will be \nto cooperate with them to assist them to use GeoSciML in their modelling. GWML5 \n(Boisvert, E., Brodaric, B., 2007) is an example of a derived implementation of \nGeoSciML for groundwater. It is also the first official collaboration between \nGeoSciML and an external exchange model group. Mineral Occurrences (Seymon, A. \net al, 2007) is an example of an inherited implementation of GeoSciML. It is being \n                                                 \n5 GWML: Groundwater Mark-up Language \ndeveloped by the Australian Government Geologists Information Committee (GGIC) \nas a model to deliver mineral occurrences information as WMS6 and WFS7. \nAustralian State, territory and federal organizations presently govern the model.  \n3. Web services standards and implementation \n3.1 Requirements  \n3.1.1 GeoSciML testbed \nThe results of the GeoSciML testbed \n(http:\/\/appgeosciml.brgm.fr\/GeoSciMLWeb\/) were presented in the 33rd IUGS \nMeeting (Oslo, August 2008). The four main requirements of this testbed were: \n\u2022 To implement a Metadata catalogue providing a Catalog Service for the Web \n(CSW) (Open Geospatial Consortium, 2007 (3)) to describe both services and \ndatasets. The Metadata profile used are the standards ISO19115 (ISO\/TC 211, \n2003 (1)) and ISO19119 (ISO\/TC 211, 2005 (2)), \n\u2022 To implement WMS and WFS services. The WFS services should deliver a \ncommon GeoSciML based data model and be able to manage a specific list of \nOGC Filters, \n\u2022 To implement web services to manage GeoSciML vocabularies,  \n\u2022 To develop a web client application demonstrating the use of the CSW, WFS and \nvocabularies services.  \n3.1.2 OneGeology-Europe \nA main objective of the OneGeology-Europe project is to allow substantial progress \ntowards INSPIRE goals: final users of the system specified and implemented by the \nproject will be able to discover, view and download geoscience data across the \nEuropean Union (EU). From this major objective come several requirements: \n\u2022 To define and implement a multilingual metadata profile for the geosciences, \nexploiting, extending and bringing up to date an existing Multilingual Thesaurus \nfor the geosciences, \n\u2022  To implement a Metadata catalogue with its metadata editor to register metadata \nof services and datasets, accessible through a multilingual discovery component \n(CSW 2.0.2) within the project data portal, \n\u2022 To define a common Data Model based on GeoSciML to exchange geological \ndata. Each data provider has to map its data to this common language, \n                                                 \n6 WMS: Web Map Services \n7 WFS: Web Feature Services \n\u2022 To define and implement a set of View and Download services for delivering and \nprocessing the geological data, \n\u2022 To implement a geoportal to provide the user with a user-friendly way to discover, \nview and access geological data.  \n3.2 Architecture  \nIn both the GeoSciML testbed and OneGeology-Europe the architecture is based on \nthe INSPIRE technical architecture, implementing Network services (INSPIRE, 2009 \n(2), INSPIRE, 2009 (3), INSPIRE, 2009 (4)). This architecture addresses the \n\u201cpublish-find-bind\u201d pattern, completed by the \u201cagree\u201d process as INSPIRE has also to \ndeal with rights management. Each country involved in the project (fewer than ten in \nthe GeoSciML testbed, twenty in OneGeology-Europe), implement view and \ndownload services. Each service dataset is described by a metadata record conforming \nto the metadata profile, in the Metadata catalogue (this implements the \u201cpublish\u201d \nprocess). A search engine included in the geoportal allows the end-user to discover \nthese services and datasets (this implements the \u201cfind\u201d process). This search engine is \na web client using the CSW service over the metadata catalogue. The geoportal then \ndirectly accesses the services hosted by the countries to display or access the datasets \n(this implements the \u201cbind\u201d process, the \u201cagree\u201d process is not addressed in the \nOneGeology-Europe and GeoSciML testbed projects). Figure 2 gives an overview of \nthe OneGeology-Europe architecture. \n3.3 Metadata  \nThe Multilingual Geological Metadata Profile currently developed in the \nOneGeology-Europe project is based on ISO 19115 (ISO\/TC 211, 2003 (1)), ISO \n19119 (ISO\/TC 211, 2005 (2)), and ISO19139 (ISO\/TC 211, 2007 (2)) (for XML \nencoding). This profile takes into account INSPIRE Implementing Rules for metadata \n(INSPIRE, 2009 (1)). Since the OneGeology-Europe catalogue will harvest several \nnational catalogues to get the records, the OneGeology-Europe profile will not contain \nany extension of the ISO standard.  \nRegarding multilingualism, the title, abstract, lineage statement, organization \ndata (organization name, address, country), and conditions for access will be \ntranslated into at least eight languages. The code-lists, either ISO or developed by the \nproject, such as keywords and some quality information, will also be translated. \nAn important part of the metadata profile concerns quality information. \nHarmonization of practices over Europe is a challenge for this topic and is still in \nprogress, but it should follow several rules:  \n\u2022 Lineage should contain both the process and the source material, using some \nstructured rules already existing in several countries,  \n\u2022 Harmonization method and level of harmonization (semantic (internal or external \nclassification) and geometry) should be described. \n \nTo harmonize as far as possible the quality data in use in the twenty countries \nsome templates are defined for the free text quality fields. The aim is not to obtain, \nautomatically, formally structured fields, but rather more readable and unified texts. \n3.4 Catalogue service \nTo manage the metadata records and to enable searching for references to available \ngeological datasets and services in both projects, a catalogue client and an associated \ncatalogue service is set up. It is based on the OGC standard Catalogue Service for the \nWeb (CSW) (Open Geospatial Consortium, 2007 (3)), with an ISO Application \nProfile. Any CSW client is able to use this interface to access the catalogue.  \n3.4.1 The catalogue in the GeoSciML testbed \nThe catalogue is based on GeoNetwork, modified to introduce some new functionality \n(to create automatically service metadata records from the service capabilities, to \ncreate also automatically a dataset metadata record from the layer information \navailable in the WMS capabilities, and to create the link between service metadata \nand related datasets metadata). GeoNetwork is a standards based, free and opensource \ncatalogue application to manage spatially referenced resources through the web \n(GeoNetwork, 2009). It stores not only services and datasets but also OGC SLD8 \n(Open Geospatial Consortium, 2005 (1)) files (used with WMS 1.1 (Open Geospatial \nConsortium, 2006 (1))) providing some common portrayal rules for the GeoSciML \nvocabularies such as the lithology. The services offered are: \n\u2022 Manual creation and editing of the records, \n\u2022 Import and export of records in ISO XML format, \n\u2022 Harvest services (WFS and WMS) for creating services and associated datasets.  \n \nThe GetCapabilites, GetRecords and GetRecordsByID operations are \nimplemented. \n3.4.2 The catalogue in the OneGeology-Europe project \nThis catalogue is MIcKA, the software used by the Czech Geological survey. It \nprovides the usual manual creation and editing of the records, and implements the \nfollowing CSW operations: \n\u2022 GetCapabilities, GetRecord and GetRecordById. The GetRecord operation \nmanages all the filters required by the INSPIRE implementing rules regarding the \ndiscovery service (INSPIRE, 2009 (2)), \n\u2022 Harvesting of services (WFS and WMS) for creating services and datasets, \n\u2022 Harvesting other CSW services to import services and datasets from national \ncatalogues. \n \nFigure 3 shows the web interface of the OneGeology-Europe Metadata \ncatalogue for the addition of a record  \n3.5 View and download data service  \nOnce the user has discovered datasets relevant to his purpose, web services are \nprovided to view and download the data. These web services are based on ISO and \nOGC standards: Web Map Service (WMS) (Open Geospatial Consortium, 2006 (2)) \nfor the view service and Web Feature Service (WFS) (Open Geospatial Consortium, \n                                                 \n8 SLD: Styled Layer Descriptor \n2005 (2)) for the data download service. For their implementation, OneGeology-\nEurope takes into account, as much as possible, rules defined by the INSPIRE \nImplementing Rules for view services (INSPIRE, 2009 (3) and download services \n(INSPIRE, 2009 (4). \n3.5.1 View services \nThe view services are implemented by OGC Web Map Services, with some specific \nrequirements to be, as far as possible, INSPIRE compliant (mainly the use of WMS \n1.3; a \u2018Language\u2019 parameter to provide layer title, abstract, and keywords and to \ndeliver legend in the requested language; and some INSPIRE mandatory performance \nrequirements which could be addressed by the OneGeology-Europe project). Other \nrequirements come from the use cases of the project. The rules are the following: \n\u2022 WMS required are: OGC WMS1.3 with SLD WMS profile 1.1.0,  \n\u2022  A new parameter \u201clanguage\u201d must be managed by each operation,  \n\u2022  The GetCapabilities, delivering the metadata of the service and the datasets is \nmandatory and should be translated into at least the national language of the \ndataset provider and English (one GetCapabilities file per language). The \nlanguage parameter allows software using the WMS to access the translated \nGetCapabilities response. In the GetCapabilities response some fields are \nmandatory and should be conformant with the Metadata profile, \n\u2022  The GetFeatureInfo operation is required, and the delivery format is harmonized: \no Text\/html should follow a template and should be (as far as possible) \ntranslated in accordance with the language parameter. \no Text\/xml response must deliver GeoSciML Data Model (harmonized \ndata model), \n\u2022  The GetMap operation should be able to manage a SLD_BODY and SLD \nparameter respecting the GeoSciML Data Model (name of the attributes), using \nogc:filter such as in the following example: \n \n<ogc:Filter>  \n<ogc:PropertyIsEqualTo>  \n<ogc:PropertyName>gsml:MappedFeature\/gsml:specification\/gsml:GeologicUnit\/\ngsml:preferredAge\/gsml:GeologicEvent\/gsml:eventAge\/gsml:CGI_TermValue\/g\nsml:value<\/ogc:PropertyName>  \n<ogc:Literal>urn:cgi:classifier:ICS:StratChart:2008:Carboniferous<\/ogc:Literal>  \n<\/ogc:PropertyIsEqualTo>  \n<\/ogc:Filter> \n \nThe name of the datasets should be harmonized in order to guarantee to the \nsystem using them that they implement the same data model. A client application (for \ninstance, a geoportal) can then use the CSW service of the catalogue to find all the \ndatasets with a specific harmonized name. We also use keywords to indicate resources \ncompliant with some specifications defined by a community; this option is to solve \nthe issue of lack of classification possibilities in the catalogue.  \nThe aim of these rules is to fill two main requirements. The first is \nmultilingualism, for instance to have two different GetCapabilities responses for two \nlanguages allowing us to provide two different legend URLs, one for each language. \nThe second aim is to enable us to provide harmonized views of the datasets, both for \nthe image (GetMap) and the attributes (GetFeatureInfo).  \n3.5.2 Download data service \nThe Download data service is implemented by an OGC Web Feature Service. This \nservice is still under discussion in the OneGeology-Europe project, so only some \npreliminary rules are given here. As for the view service, the OneGeology-Europe \nproject will try to use INSPIRE rules for the download service. INSPIRE recommends \nthe provision of two types of download service:  \n\u2022 Download pre-defined data stored in a file using a simple HTTP Get protocol (the \nlink is defined into the dataset metadata),  \n\u2022 Direct access to data, with the possibility of using search criteria (bounding box, \nvalues of selected attributes, \u2026). This type of download will be based on ISO \nstandards WFS 2.0 (ISO\/TC 211, 2009 (1)) and Filter Encoding (ISO\/TC 211, \n2009 (2)). \n \nThe Language parameter is also mandatory for INSPIRE. \nThe OneGeology-Europe project will implement the \u201cdirect access service\u201d \nbut with WFS 1.1.0 (as there is not yet stable software implementing WFS 2.0), and \nwith the Filter Encoding standard.  \nA key objective is that the GetFeature operation delivering the data should \ndeliver the GeoSciML schema. A specific list of ogc:filter should be defined (and was \ndefined for the GeoSciML testbed).  \nExample: query all the geologic units where the lower age is \u201cMiddle \nJurassic\u201d: \n<ogc:Filter>  \n<ogc:PropertyIsEqualTo>  \n<ogc:PropertyName>gsml:MappedFeature\/gsml:specification\/gsml:GeologicUnit\/gs\nml:preferredAge\/gsml:GeologicEvent\/gsml:eventAge\/gsml:CGI_TermRange\/gsml:lo\nwer\/gsml:CGI_TermValue\/gsml:value<\/ogc:PropertyName>  \n<ogc:Literal>urn:cgi:classifier:ICS:StratChart:2008:MiddleJurassic<\/ogc:Literal>  \n<\/ogc:PropertyIsEqualTo>  \n<\/ogc:Filter> \n \nExample: query all the Dykes: \n \n<ogc:Filter>  \n<ogc:and> \n<ogc:PropertyIsEqualTo>  \n<ogc:PropertyName>gsml:MappedFeature\/gsml:specification\/gsml:GeologicUnit\/gs\nml:bodyMorphology\/gsml:CGI_TermValue\/gsml:value<\/ogc:PropertyName>  \n<ogc:Literal>urn:cgi:classifier:CGI:GeologicUnitMorphology:200811:dyke<\/ogc:Lit\neral>  \n<\/ogc:PropertyIsEqualTo>  \n<\/ogc:and> \n<\/ogc:Filter> \n \nIn the OneGeology-Europe project, a language parameter is added in the same \nway as for the view service (Web Map Service). \n3.5.3 The language parameter \nManaging multilinguality is a key point for European Geological Surveys in the \nINSPIRE context. As the standards used for discovery, view, and download services \n(CSW, WMS, WFS) do not yet address this issue, no software is available. The \nsolution implemented by OneGeology-Europe is to provide a software component \n(the 1GE-Connector) on top of these standard services to select which service to \nrequest according to the requested language. \n4. Benefits of web services standards and harmonization: examples of usage \n4.1 First example: use of the common data model and SLD-profile in a WMS \nThe OneGeology-Europe geoportal (http:\/\/onegeology-\neurope.brgm.fr\/geoportal\/viewer.jsp) will display a harmonized geological dataset of \nthe whole Europe. Figure 4 is a screenshot of the OneGeology-Europe portal showing \na portion of the harmonized geological map of Europe at 1:1 million scale. This \ndataset is technically composed of twenty images requested from twenty Web Map \nServices. For this dataset, the geoportal provides a \u201cquery then view\u201d function, using \nthe SLD  parameter of the GetMap operation. The user chooses some criteria, for \nexample an age presented as a list of values coming from the OneGeology-Europe \nGeoSciML vocabularies. He also chooses a colour, and then applies the style. \nIn response to this action, the geoportal builds a SLD defining portrayal rules \naccording to the ogc:filter using the GeoSciML name of the attributes. In the case of \nour example, age could be translated by the following value: \n\u201cgsml:MappedFeature\/gsml:specification\/gsml:GeologicUnit\/gsml:preferredA\nge\/gsml:GeologicEvent\/gsml:eventAge\/gsml:CGI_TermValue\/gsml:value\u201d \n \nThen a new GetMap request is sent with this SLD and each Web Map Service \ndisplays its part of the full dataset, using the same portrayal rules. The result is a map \nhighlighting all the features having the same age. \nThree standards are required to be able to provide such a function: \n\u2022  OGC Web Map Services for the GetMap request, \n\u2022  All the Web Map Services implementing (at least partially) the OGC SLD profile, \n\u2022  A common standard data model (in our case, GeoSciML) applied at two levels: a \ncommon structure (names of the attributes), and a harmonized content (use of \nreferenced and translated vocabularies). \n \nFigure 5 shows several European countries hosting a WMS delivering the \nharmonized geological map of Europe at 1:1 million scale. Using the common data \nmodel (GeoSciML) a common SLD is sent to each WMS (request GetMap), to \ndisplay all the geologic units of \u201cproterozoic\u201d age in pink. \n4.2 Second example: use of the common data model in a WFS \nOne major challenge of the OneGeology-Europe project is to move geological \nknowledge closer to the end-user. In this context, a principal requirement is the legend \nof the dataset. It should be \u201ceasy to read\u201d for a non-geologist, with details and some \nlinks to glossaries, but it should also be detailed and scientifically useful for a \ngeologist.  \nThe OneGeology-Europe portal provides a tool to display the legend of a \nsmall part of the map selected by the user. The geoportal requests all the Web Feature \nServices with an ogc:filter on the bounding box corresponding to the area. Then, it \nanalyses the result to determine the list of the differing features to present either as a \nvery detailed response, or as a basic legend of the features displayed. This tool also \npresents some statistics. \n4.3 Impact of OneGeology-Europe and GeoSciML on other projects \nThe work done by Geological Surveys on GeoSciML has been used in the \nOneGeology-Europe project and in OneGeology-Global. The aim of OneGeology-\nGlobal is to create dynamic geological map data of the world available via the web \n(113 countries involved, about 60 WMS services available). There are less technical \nconstraints for the providers than for European providers in the OneGeology-Europe \nproject. A \u201csimple\u201d WMS is required with some metadata, and a legend, with naming \nrules (for services and layers). \nGEOSS9 and INSPIRE share the same architecture principles, and the \ncatalogue of services available for OneGeology is now registered in the GEOSS \nComponent and Service Registry. \n5. Conclusions \nGeoSciML has been developed to enable interoperability of geoscience information. \nIt is the product of an international collaboration between geoscience data providers, \nmainly geological surveys, and the self-funded nature of the activity is one of the \nfactors that has enabled significant progress to be made. The development has \nfollowed a standards-based approach from the development of the data model through \nto the implementation of the schema derived from it. This has reduced development \ntime through the re-use of pre-existing, and standard, elements allowing the \nGeoSciML development to concentrate on the specifically geoscientific  components. \nUse of international spatial standards has also assisted in achieving interoperability, \nnot just within the geoscience community but to other domains, thus enabling \ngeoscience data to be incorporated into non-geoscientific applications. \nGeoSciML enables schematic interoperability, but semantic interoperability \nrequires agreement on the concepts used to describe geoscience information. Existing \ninternationally agreed concepts, such as the age periods defined in the ICS \nStratigraphic Time Chart, are used where these are available. For many geoscience \nconcepts no such agreement exists however and the IWG has set up a Concept \nDefinition task group to agree concepts for interoperability. \nThe OneGeology-Europe project is using GeoSciML in the web service \ndelivery of a harmonized geological map of Europe at approximately 1:1 million \nscale. The implementation of web services using GeoSciML, both in the GeoSciML \n                                                 \n9 GEOSS: Global Earth Observation System of Systems \n(http:\/\/www.earthobservations.org\/gci_gci.shtml) \ntestbed and the OneGeology-Europe project, also follows a standards based \nmethodology. This is necessary to ensure interoperable services, and in the case of \nOneGeology-Europe it is also providing a test of the implementation of the INSPIRE \ntechnical architecture which in turn is based largely on international standards. \nA metadata catalogue of both data sets and services has been set up for \nOneGeology-Europe along with a catalogue service, conforming to the OGC CSW \nstandard, to manage and access it. In addition OneGeology-Europe has set up view \nand download services which aim to be INSPIRE compliant as far as possible and use \nthe OGC WMS and WFS standards. \nThe use of GeoSciML and OGC standards enables a user of the OneGeology-\nEurope portal to query the twenty component Web Map Services using a common \nvocabulary and display the results in a common style. The use of the OGC WFS \nstandard in conjunction with GeoSciML enables the production and display of a \ndetailed legend of a user selected area, drawn from one or more web services. It can \nbe seen therefore that the schematic and semantic standardisation of the data model in \nGeoSciML, accompanied by the use of OGC web service standards, has enabled a \nsignificant level of geoscience data interoperability. The experience that has been \ngained in this work will be relevant to the application of INSPIRE standards to \ngeoscience and to incorporating geoscience data into a future Digital Earth. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe development of GeoSciML was carried out by an international group of \ncollaborators under the CGI Interoperability Working Group \n(https:\/\/www.seegrid.csiro.au\/twiki\/bin\/view\/CGIModel\/InteroperabilityWG), and we \nhave drawn on their work in describing GeoSciML.
