It refuses the idea that heritage can \nbe interpreted solely as artefacts or as images of the past. Instead it \nfocuses on the interpretive and communicative work needed to make sense \nof the built heritage of the UK. The examples chosen are a Tudor manor \nhouse in the south east of England, where each year a living history event \nis staged in order to bring the history of the house 'to life', and a re-\nenactment society that portrays the events of the British Civil War at \nhistoric properties. By means of participant observation the activities of \nresearch, interpretation and education are examined along with the \nsources on enjoyment they provide. It is suggested that this is closely \nentwined with producing a sense of realism and 'authenticity'. However, \nboth these concepts are seen to have problematic implications. The paper \nargues that heritage is a much more self-reflexive activity than commonly \nportrayed with a complex bundle of 'enjoyments' and knowledges being \ncreated. These are then posed as one way of interpreting built heritage as \noppose to more academic models. \n- 1 - \nIntroduction. \n \nThe growing academic commentary on the heritage industry has been \nbroadly critical and highlights a variety of problems with heritage events. \nCommentators have consistently suggested that a focus on an eclectic mix \nof historical artefacts\/replicas produces a surface of 'historicality' rather \nthan an understanding of history (Walsh 1992, Fowler 1992, Hewison \n1987). Such a superficial image of the past tends to cover the history of \nsocial strife in the country and concentrate instead on the aesthetic \ncharms of the past dwellings of principally the rich and thus portray a \npastoral myth of the British past - through the disproportionately large \npercentage of resources devoted to preserving country and manor houses \n(Walsh 1992, Wright 1985). However the reflective language of portrayal \nand image used is symptomatic for, by and large, such authors \nconcentrate on the past as made present in images. Preserved buildings \nare not seen so much as sites for interpretive practices as facades that \nrepresent an appearance of 'pastness'. Such a focus on images fits with an \nidea that surfaces and appearances are growing dominant - a theme \nresonating through the work of such as Harvey (1989) on postmodernity. \nFowler, for instance, makes strong appeals that we should not become \nobsessed with a wildly eclectic mix of aesthetically attractive bits of the \npast (1991, 1989). Rather he calls for a return to scholarly analysis, to \nhistory that cannot be reduced to snippets and interesting little vignettes. \nHeritage, it is suggested, is a tabloid history that turns to 'shallow \ntitillation' (Walsh 1992:1) with the standards of Citizen Kane (if there is \nno history then invent some) and the clich\u00e9d human interest story. My \npurpose is not to deny these ingredients are in this potent cocktail. Rather \nI wish to recast the ways in which they are seen and experienced. \n \n- 2 - \nBound up in this conceptualisation is often an idea of heritage as a series \nof false or misleading images that obscure the true past (Wright 1989). An \nidea that relies on a one way flow of knowledge (true or false) from the \n'imagineers' to the people and an often unacknowledged model where \nculture is used to 'dupe' consumers (Wright 1985). However I argue that \none cannot fully assess the way heritage is produced and consumed in \nterms of a reflective model. I wish to suggest that this is an oversimple \nmodel of how history is consumed in heritage practices. There are \nimportant implications in the idea of heritage sights (Urry 1990) but we \ncannot forget that historic buildings are just as often sites for interpretive \nactivities. I hope to demonstrate how the built heritage can be experienced \nas an event, through a self-conscious articulation and creative process of \nunderstanding, that contains elements of a quixotic quest for the \n'authentic'. Such a quest has been argued to be at the core of \ncontemporary modern subjectivities and exemplified in the figure of the \ntourist (MacCannell 1992, Morris 1988, Redfoot 1984, Culler 1981, \nAbbeele 1980). In the dislocated western world, a decentred subject can \nnever experience the authentic but always ends up faced with the markers \nof that experience rather than the experience itself. We may go to see an \nhistoric house but all we encounter are the signs of tourism (Morris 1988), \nthe markers that direct us and tell us 'this is historic as oppose to that \nwhich is not'. There is no unmediated encounter with the past and \neverything becomes a sign of itself (Culler 1981). \"This in turn motivates a \ndesperate search for the real thing, in which people happily borrow the \npersonas and accoutrements of those whom modern mythology defines as \nquintessentially real\" (Handler 1987:339).  \n \nWith Handler, I suggest that the conjuncture of living history and tourism \nprovides a stage on which these wider problems of knowledge and \n- 3 - \nexperience are performed. Living history and re-enactments are surely \none avenue through which heritage interpreters have tried to access 'The \npromotional milieu of the late 20th century, [with its] informal education, \ntourism, the appetite of the mass media for events and \"docu-drama\" or \n\"edutainment\", a social premium on experiences and self-awareness, all \n[of which] have popularized Living History as a picturesque and \nintriguing activity' (Fortier 1987:2-3). However, I suggest that the quest \nfor the real in re-enactments is considerably more of a self-knowing \nperformance than is often suggested - and that it is this that makes living \nhistory such an exemplary dramatisation of modernity. \n \nIn this paper, I sketch a few dynamics of a typical 'heritage' strategy to \nmake an 'experience' out of the built environment - the costumed \ninterpreter and re-enactor. I begin by arguing that one dynamic is the \ndemocratic nature of knowledge formation in living history and go on to \nassess just how appropriate metaphors of shallowness and superficiality \nmay be. This discussion raises issues of authenticity and accuracy in \nportrayal. But then I ask how these portrayals fit with the way in which \nliving history interpretation is structured. I suggest that by providing a \nre-production, a re-presentation in the strongest sense, of one period \ndifficulties of interpretation are produced. But there are strengths amid \nthese problems. Finally, I argue that these strengths and weaknesses \ncannot then be separated from precisely the forms of titillation so well \ncritiqued in the literature. The production of historical interpretations is \nby a constellation of pleasures\/knowledges and different forms of \n'enjoyment'. By illustrating some of these I hope to argue that if we are \nnot careful critiques of the heritage industry end up advocating a single \nmeans of enjoying the past - and that this discards much that is positive \nin other ways of experiencing the past. \n- 4 - \n Experiencing the Past. \n \nThe study leading to this paper has been based on participant observation \nwith two re-enactment groups which promote themselves with the claim \nthat they 'bring history back to life'. Such 'living histories' have been \ndivided into living museums, experimental archaeology and recreational \nevents (Anderson 1984, Glassberg 1986). The first category is that \norganised as an educational and interpretive strategy with paid employees \nin museums or heritage centres; the second is where historical evidence is \nused to research and recreate artefacts and to test theories about them \ndeduced from remains. The third type is where volunteers take part in a \nrecreation (in all senses) for their own enjoyment. I focus largely on this \nlast category. I hope to show that elements of all three are embroiled and \none cannot separate the practices of interpretation, research or pleasure \nentwined around living history. \n \nI joined markedly different groups in order to research these issues of \nheritage presentation. Firstly, I was involved in one of the smaller \nsocieties recreating the British Civil War for 2 years 'campaigning' over a \nseason from April to October. In the course of this season, units organise \nand travel to 'musters', varying in size, frequency and theme, to restage \ndifferent parts of the conflict. Some events were held in 'open fields' but \nthe majority were promoted by English Heritage (the government \npreservation quango) to attract visitors to their sites, such as castles, \nwhich had played a role in that conflict. The largest recreations have up to \n1800 participants for a weekend and might occur 3 or 4 times a season \nwhile other smaller events, such as skirmishes or living histories, fill in \nthe calendar. It might be possible to go to 6 to 8 events up and down the \n- 5 - \ncountry in a normal season, though not everyone would. What events you \nattended was dependent on the unit in which you 'served' and your own \ncommitments. Like most of the other participants I encountered, I joined a \nunit to which I had some connections, via a friend, which happened to be \nthe 'Parliamentary Trayne of Artillery' and began, like many others, by \nborrowing equipment until I\/they could make or purchase it from the \n'traders' that attend major events. \n \nThe second society I joined is dedicated to the recreation of Tudor \ndomestic life, based at a Tudor house in the south east of England \nportraying a different period year each year. Each summer participants \nare recruited (via contacts or newspaper advertisements asking whether \nreaders would like to \"Live as a Tudor\") and undergo a process of \ninterviewing and seminars to train them for the event. Each one receives \nnotes on costume of the period (25 pages for humble figures such as \nmyself, more for gentry characters, and another 15 pages on shoes) from \nwhich they must make their own costume. This is vetted at a further \ninterview. There is no subsidy towards either attending the seminars or \nthe cost of the costume (\u00a370 for a pedlar to up to \u00a3300 for gentry \ndepending on luck, and cloth prices). The event itself lasts for a month \nwith participants staying from one week up to the whole event. It is \nvisited by members of the public on weekends and school children wearing \nhomemade costumes on weekdays. The Tudor depiction is designed to \nshow daily life at the heigh day of the family who built the manor and also \nchimes with the national curricula which has the Tudor period as a topic \nof study.  \n \nI would emphasise that, while I made no effort to conceal my interests, I \nfunctioned more as participant than observer since commentators stressed \n- 6 - \nthat re-enactors (\"history buffs\") sought an authentic, subjective \nexperience, that would feel and not just look real (Anderson 1984, Handler \n1987:338), thus participation seemed to be the key to understanding this \nparticular heritage experience. Such an emphasis on participation does \ncause problems, both at the time, and now in terms of distancing myself \nfrom the re-enactors (Fyfe 1992). It will become apparent that the degree \nof overlap between my position and theirs is a strong undercurrent in this \npaper and for this reason I have tried to be explicit about my own \npositionality and engagement rather than retreating into a third person \naccount. Many participants knew my purposes, but I did not wear a lapel \nbadge with a 60 word summary of the project. Partly in acknowledgement \nof this, and after speaking to many informants, I have kept them \nanonymous. I trust the reader will bear with the various inexactitudes in \ndescriptions, which would be highly untypical of my informants, that I \nhave used to uphold this promise.  \n \nHierarchical Knowledge and Democratising History. \n \nMcIlwraith (1989) suggested a role for academics in arbitrating and \ndeciding on the boundaries of what should be classed as heritage. He \nsuggested that, once one got beyond national monuments and towards \nparts of the everyday landscape, disputes would escalate. In this he is \ncorrect, but I am less sure of where his positioning of the academic leads \nus. His academic is the \"legislator\" who informs the public of the \nsignificance of traces of the past. It has been argued that much of the \ndrive of heritage and contemporary society consists in previously silenced \ngroups striving to overturn this hierarchy (Bauman 1991). The nineteenth \ncentury development of the museum also sought to position the public as a \npassive recipient of knowledge brought to them by legitimate experts, in \n- 7 - \nan attempt to create both a singular public and a singular history, and \nthis has been challenged by new groups focused around amenity politics \nand forming a mass of \"passionate minorities\" (Ashworth & Tunbridge \n1990:4, Wright 1985). The rise of re-enactments seems to occur at the \nconfluence of grass-roots activism in the early 70s and the popularity of \nnew interpretive strategies for heritage (cf. Fortier 1987:3). \n \nIn re-enactment societies I would suggest that what we witness is a \nchance for some of that previously silenced public to assume the role of \nresearcher themselves. For instance, I was trying to think through issues \nabout how they\\we were interpreting the civil war. I thus began looking \nfor academic histories that might inform my research. I mentioned one to \nsome members of the group (Carlton 1991). The first said he had not read \nit but began to cite the review of the book in the group's newsletter, while \nanother member actually had read the book and began to list a specific set \nof criticisms. While attending an event near this latter person's home, a \ngroup of us slept in the attic where he and his partner kept about 150 \nsource books on the civil war. If this were not enough to indicate a depth \nof understanding of the period, on the floor were replicas of 2 cannon \nbarrels he had made from wood and which would be used to make moulds \nand cast replica pieces for the society. After some people expressed \ninterest he began recounting the precise sources he had used in creating \nthese patterns - based on archaeological finds in Britain and America.  \n \nMuch of the above discussion was based around articles in academic or \ntechnical journals with the swapping and comparing of 'new finds'. The \nthrill of discovering new texts and sources for the period, that most \nacademic enjoyment, was also a part of this experience of living history - \nand is, in my experience, the most common topic on internet discussion \n- 8 - \nlists set up around re-enactors and historical costumers. But these re-\nenactors had become convinced that disciplinary divides limited academic \nhistorians from understanding parts of the 'British revolution'. For \nexample, historians often had scant understanding of ballistics and so \nmade errors in assessing artillery. Likewise, experience of re-enacting \nindicated the limits of relying on texts about past practices since practical \nexperiments by re-enactors had shown how far these texts diverged from \nprobable practice. In these cases some re-enactors may be providing new \ninformation to historians - not definitive ideas on how things were done \nbut another view at least (cf. Shaw 1992). It is possible to add that re-\nenactors place a different emphasis on some historical theories. For \ninstance, I had become familiar with academic discussions of how \nconventions in representations led to women being depicted as frail and \nincapable of physical activity. Some of the women re-enacting gentry roles \nsaw this from a different angle, as when one grumbled at the Tudor event, \n'you can't breathe in these bodices ... it is only some years when the men \nhave to wear boned costume as well and they suddenly realise what we go \nthrough every year'. The re-enactors focused on the way clothes did not \njust reflect conceptions of gendered activities but played an active role in \nensuring compliance with these conceptions. I suggest this dynamic is one \nthat sets in play a more active relationship between realism, felt as \nverisimilitude to a possible past, and verification (Enscore 1993) than is \noften suggested in the literature. \n \nDevil in the Detail: Research and antiquarian obsessions. \n \nRe-enactments also served to educate participants by encouraging \nresearch and providing more information on the topic to be covered. In \nrecreating the Tudor domestic environment every participant was told to \n- 9 - \ngo off and look at period illustrations and sources in order to get patterns \nto make up costumes and, since the year portrayed alters, the participants \nhave to learn trends in Tudor fashion. There is no room here for 'coarse \ncostume', the sort of rough smock theatres use to indicate peasants of all \nperiods from 500AD to 1600AD. And should a participant wish to be a \ngentry personage then they have to research the biography of the \ncharacter (for peasants this is optional though all have to invent a \nplausible biography). Other groups go further and actually do recreate \nknown biographies and events with details given in packs to each \nparticipant to build \"mental maps\" of the time, society and area \n(Robertshaw 1992). \n \nTo put this for an academic audience, I might liken the seminars, \nbackground information and costume preparation involved in 'becoming a \nTudor' to preparing to carry out a classic ethnography - but of a Tudor \nmanor. I would use all the problematic maxims that the ethnographer\/re-\nenactor is trying to get inside the world of the 'Tudors', that they are \ntrying to empathise with the world of the subjects, and all the provisos \nthat ethnographers\/re-enactors know they will never totally succeed but \nthat the attempt is crucial to the endeavour. Of course, the difference is \nthat the Tudor community only exists because we are all studying it. It is \na totally discursive and reflexive object where everyone is learning the \nculture by studying everyone else studying the culture. This reflexivity \nleads to the possible creation of \"fakelore\", a consistent performance that \nowes more to the participants' dynamics than the period where, because \nan influential participant starts something, everyone follows until it \nbecomes an orthodoxy. But I would stress this is not my insight, for there \nwere warning notices about just such re-enactment 'myths' in the \n- 10 - \nparticipants' rest room at the Tudor manor. Failings were noted and \nstriven to be corrected. \n \nThe participants were very much aware of the limitations of what they \ntried to achieve. Throughout my time with these groups I repeatedly \nheard the word 'authenty' meaning historically accurate, when referring \nto pieces of 'kit' (equipment\/costume). Quite often participants would \nproudly document the sources and materials used to recreate items that a \nvisitor might never see or appreciate (a dice pot, or pieces of cutlery). The \nquest for ever more and better 'kit' also organises pleasure around \nauthenticity and a technical argot that may well amount to 'a \nsophisticated antiquarian concern for detail' (Woods 1989:43) or almost a \nfetishisation of the material forms of authenticity. \n \nThe tension in this appreciation of detail is between the typical and the \nauthentic. If re-enactors care about detail they are labelled 'buffs', if they \ndo not they are accused of 'bending history' (Hewison 1991), and it is an \nimportant practical issue. Thus on the recreated Tudor manor there were \nactivities of which there was no precise historical record - they may or \nmay not have been there at the time, but it was useful to run them in \norder to give a sense of the period's life style. Likewise sometimes it is \nalmost dangerous to play up the authentic, but atypical, history for fear \nthat it will provide a misleading impression - a documented historical \nexception can become a rule for re-enactors and a myth is born. \nAlternately, all summer there is a sort of peripatetic warfare going on \neach weekend. Imaginary battles were refought wherever they could be - \noriginal topography or battle plans were a savoured rarity - so generally \nthe Royalists won on Saturday and the Roundheads on Sunday. To a large \nextent the focus was on the typical or illustrative rather than the actual. \n- 11 - \nHowever, the events focused upon are climactic battles rather than \nequally common sieges - one averaged a day the other 54 days (Carlton \n1991). And there are no casualties, no crying of the dead and maimed \n(though event commentators do emphasise this). The 'armies' have not \nmarched several miles, slept under hedges or suffered the ravages of \ndisease. But I have sat in on discussions about how many of us should \nhave scabies, how well or poorly dressed we should be, and so on. In the \nlast few years replica encampments have been set up for visitors to see, as \nwell as the battle, and there are quite a few smaller events where a few \nre-enactors portray the daily life of a garrison of a castle or fortified house.  \n \nThere are differences between the itinerant displays of re-enactment \nsocieties and the living history display on a period site. While one is aimed \nmore at display and the other at a more informed interpretation both have \nworrying sides. A simple battle display does come close to images of \nhistory rather than an analysis. But in doing so it knowingly and \nparadoxically discards much of the obsession with authenticity in the \nname of education. Living history sites, on the other hand, have to rely on \nmarketing themselves as 'time capsules', as re-creations allowing one to \nsmell the smells of Tudor times, hear the speech patterns (Phillips 1984) - \nto experience 'the way we were', whatever 'we' that was (Hewison 1991). It \nis this promise of an authentic recreation that distinguishes them as \nplaces to visit. Yet the participants know that they are only producing \ninterpretations of what might have been there. Indeed, the participants \ntend to be much quicker than visitors to spot anachronisms since it is the \nparticipants who have put in the effort researching the period and tend to \nwant to make the best possible job of it. \n \n- 12 - \nCriticisms of accuracy or the ethics involved in restaging horrific conflicts \nfor entertainment can be argued over. Whether it is better that these wars \nbe forgotten or commemorated and how best to do so is a live issue both in \nterms of glorifying conflict (Walsh 1991:2) or whether re-enactors do not \ntry and portray the human level of suffering, and in terms of retaining or \ndomesticating the only 'British revolution'. But, as re-enactments must \njustify their often militarist trappings, academics need to also explain \ntheir intense hostility to re-enactment. While doing this research I have \nencountered persistent scepticism from colleagues, at a most visceral \nlevel. It is true that much of the attention to detail is almost obsessive \nover minutiae. But I am forced to ask myself whether researching a PhD, \nas I was, provides the most Olympian height from which to sneer at this. \nThe real doubts seem to concern the way in which the past is enjoyed. \nThere is an emotional and empathetic bond with what is depicted and this \nseems to provoke a hugely intemperate response from academics that \noverlooks the self-reflexivity of the re-enactors that I have encountered \nand invokes the superiority of a rational understanding of the past. But \none has to ask then whether this dismissal of all 'emotive' and 'affinitive' \nknowledge is not dangerously phallogocentric, and whether rational \nresearch does not itself also form a way of 'enjoying' the past. One must \nalso question the dichotomisation of entertainment and education implied \nand to what extent academia is an interested party in maintaining one \nside of the dichotomy as legitimate knowledge and cultural capital \n(Bourdieu 1988, 1990). The enjoyment of re-enactments brings together \nresearch and a more empathetic approach but stands as a middlebrow art \nin seeking recognition in the terms of the legitimate culture (bookish \ninterpretation) while exploring the scandalous possibilities of other ways \nof knowing (empathetic or holistic approaches). I believe this empathetic \n- 13 - \napproach is crucial to understanding how living history works and what \nits benefits and limits are. It is to this topic that I now wish to turn. \n \nTime Capsules, Actors and Interpreters. \n \nIt is necessary to differentiate between what might be termed third and \nfirst person styles of interpretation. Third person styles use a costumed \ninterpreter who explains the significance of what is portrayed. They can \ncomment on what 'they' did then and it's connections with the present, or \nhow it might fit into wider social trends of the period. In many ways the \ncostume is decorative and the interpreter works as an 'interactive display' \n(Woods 1989:46) telling the audience what is going on. By contrast, the \nless common, first person interpretation involves the participant acting in \nperiod role and showing what would have been going on.  \n \nIt was this latter sort of performance in which I\/we were most engaged in \nand which the Tudor manor was 'famous' for employing. The experience \nsuch living histories attempt to provide is the recreation an entire \nenvironment, and thus a world apart from the present, a 'magic kingdom' \nwhere the past lives. They are described in terms of time travel, and time \nships (eg \"Time capsule\", \"the Museum Time-Machine\"). Thus in the \nTudor recreation of the year 1593 visitors might ask what was being done \nand would be answered in period terms. Thus if visitors asked a lowly \npedlar (me) what he thought of an issue of high politics, let us say \nrelations with Spain, they would receive a response appropriate to a \npedlar's knowledge - not a historian's treatise. It is to sustain this sort of \nrole playing that many devices of 'time travel' are employed to prepare \nvisitors. To enter the Tudor recreation visitors had to pass through a 'time \ntunnel'. As a concept (and as a plywood construction) this appeared \n- 14 - \nlaughable. But it can equally be looked on as a way of accustoming visitors \nto this interpretive strategy. They approached the manor but could not see \nit behind a gate-house. They must then pass through this 'tunnel' and \nwhen they emerge the manor farm and house are suddenly revealed. It is \na device to create a dramatic space on which, with the willing collusion of \nthe visitors, a performance can be inscribed (Chaney 1993:17). Rather \nthan see an old house which has undergone change and alteration as time \nflowed by, it must be made out as 'in the past'. The capsule effect, then, \ninvolves denying the passage of time - despite the presence of all those \nanachronistic alterations. \n \nThis does cause problems. A Tudor re-enactor commented that 'we never \nrecreate the past, just produce interpretations of it - ones that might be of \nmore interest than dry books' (cf. Wexler 1988:67). Or as a couple of Civil \nWar participants describe it, 'it's an effort to produce something not \ntotally dissimilar to what might have happened and we just have to try \nand get as close as we can within the limits'. But as a period character, \nyou cannot explain that there are competing theories when you would \nhave known; thus over-definite statements of disputed issues get given. \nAnd just as re-enactors cannot show ignorance of what the characters \nwould have known they cannot be knowledgeable about what they would \nnot have known. Participants on the Tudor manor may have attended \nseminars that covered political repression but they cannot suggest that \ngood Queen Bess runs\/ran the equivalent of a police state since (a) they \nwould not know of this parallel and (b) since she does\/did, the character \nwould not dare say it. At the heart of the effectiveness of the medium is \nthen its holistic realism and its immediacy yet at the same time we can \nbegin to see why this is also its greatest drawback. \n \n- 15 - \nAttempts to address the issue tend to be sidetracked into discussions of \n'authenticity' of materials - and re-enactors seem to end up in a quest for \nan impossible absolute that will answer all the questions (Fortier 1987:4). \nIndeed, making such efforts lays the display open to the charge that it \ncreates an isolated pocket, a static cameo (Walsh 1992:104), which, \nhowever authentic it may be, is poor at illustrating abstract concepts and \nhistorical change (Leon & Piatt 1989:90, Stover 1989:13). Or as it has \nbeen phrased \"Academicians have frequently charged that as a teaching \nand a research method, living history fails to analyse historical \ninformation critically. Instead, some have charged living history presents \nself-indulgent antiquarian history dramatized by buffs in elaborately \ndetailed recreated environments.\" (Woods 1989:43). This I would suggest \nis where living history does have most problems when it easily becomes a \nself-contained narrative episode that does not bring in wider issues - what \nThomas Schlereth (1978:39) criticised as 'peaceable kingdoms'. However, \nthere are coping strategies if not solutions to this. One that is used \noccasionally is to have 20% of participants in red T-shirts acting as third \nperson interpreters (Robertshaw 1992). Another is through adequate \norientation material. For instance, the Tudor re-enactment is designed to \nfit into the national curriculum for school visits, so the hope is that such \nissues may be covered in the class room. Participants may also use \nteleological explanations - that is that apparently innocently invoke future \nevents 'as if' by accident without mentioning them. This can be almost \nteeth gratingly irritating if it goes wrong but if\/when the visitor makes the \nconnection their normal burst of pride and enthusiasm is worth it. For \nexample, a Tudor re-enactor refers to tensions in the church (a long run \nsocial issue), by cursing the curate for shutting the ale-houses. This gets \nblank faces, so she calmly adds that she cares not for 'these purists that \n- 16 - \nwould have everything from the book' and no pictures. Suddenly visitors \nmake the connection to puritanism.  \n \nBut above all living history allows some measure of connection to ordinary \npeople, for so long the goal of the 'new' social history, and this is by far the \nmost popular aspect (Robertshaw 1992, Wexler 1988, Woods 1989). The \nTudor event occurs at a manor house, but rather than just see a building \nthat has been preserved and restored it creates the possibility for an \naffinitive link with the people of the past, a sense of identification, a sense \nof understanding the life of different people so long ago. As such it tries to \noffer a privileged vision into the 'back stages' of history, the previously \nprivate and domestic. This surely is part of its appeal as an authentic \nversion of the past which shows not just the bare elements but the whole \nof past lives. We can dream of seeing the world as they saw it even as \nmodern society cannibalises its past and stages it for its own amusement \n(MacCannell 1992). \n \nInstantly I know that this is not so, that we cannot think like past people \n(Handler 1987:340, Peterson 1988:29). Some claim they try, but most \nknow this is not so. But it is extremely difficult to write about the feelings \nof re-enactors without slipping into dangerous clich\u00e9s - Wexler for \ninstance starts talking of 'reverse reincarnation' (1988:62) and Anderson \nstarts talking of seeing life from 'the point of view of stone age peoples' \n(Anderson 1984). I would suggest the experience is like that of watching a \nplay or a good movie, perhaps a horror story where the atmosphere draws \nyou in until, suddenly, you leap out of the chair in shock. Afterwards, \nlaughing a little nervously, you are embarrassed at once again falling for \nall the obvious cues. Likewise there is something stirring about hearing \nCivil War drums echo around a valley and seeing a column of troops \n- 17 - \nemerge from a wood. And people feel something. Just for a moment. And \nthen it is gone.  \n \nIt is this feeling that means school children remember their visits as the \nhighlight of a term. It is why they come back as participants or can \nrecount the whole thing ten years after visiting. It is the \"magic\" of a visit \nthat participants mention, that is a dramatic experience, perhaps truly \nmodern in its requirement to stage, to dramatise to create an 'authentic' \nfeeling. It is not an immediate confrontation with the past 'brought to life' \nthat creates the feeling of reaching the previously hidden reaches of \nhistory. Rather in a truly modern manner it is also an acceptance and \ninclusion of the mechanisms of staging that past, and a self-consciousness \nof their own artifice that produces pleasure. Not just voyeuristic pleasure \nin viewing the hidden but pleasures in recreating and re-presenting parts \nof it. \n \nMagical Realism or Critical Distance? \n \nWhat this does all do, though, is to shift the interpretive burden onto the \nvisitor. The participant may try to subtly guide ideas but basically they \nbecome informants providing information that is then actively interpreted \namongst the visitors, democratising still further the research process \nsome would argue:- \n\"By capitalizing on the public's preference to make the study \nof history an active rather than a passive pursuit, living-\nhistory museums can turn museum visitors into investigators \nof the past.\" \nLeon & Piatt (1989:92) \n- 18 - \nI cannot count the number of times parents would point a child to \nsomething and say 'See that isn't that like?..' or 'how is that different to \nwhat we do now?' (cf. Fortier 1987:7). Elderly visitors started telling \nchildren about life before electricity or drew connections to some practices \nthey remembered. But, if in error, they could not be corrected since \nparticipants could not comment on 'future' periods. Meanwhile to make \nthe whole sense work there had to be the willed suspension of disbelief. \nVisitors had to enter into the spirit of things if they were to really get \nanything out of it. As one participant put it, \"We are just trying to delude \nthe public out of their ignorance\". Which is why I earlier raised doubts \nabout how myths could so easily be promulgated; by portraying 'the past' \nand asking for a suspension of disbelief visitors are given few ways of \ncriticising or challenging what is going on.  \n \nAnd yet if they were to get a better appreciation of what is being \nattempted then they also had to maintain a critical distance. While such \ndistancing did occur to some extent in myriads of discussions about how \n(recreated) history compared with present life (Robertshaw 1992) visitors \nalso needed the interpretive wherewithal to assess the re-enactment, to \nargue with it (Walsh 1992:99). It was worrying when such comments as \nmentioned earlier could be framed about half-remembered eras - in the \nfertile territory on the edge of memory and domestic folklore (Hewison \n1991) - seeming to occasionally assume that once we were safely in the \npast it was all much of a much muchness and that it was static \n(Lowenthal 1989). So grandmother's life was not just compared to but \nlikened to Tudor period activities. Meanwhile the realism did give a \npowerful aid on occasions - as when one visitor announced that the brick-\nmaking was inauthentic since 'they didn't have bricks in those days'. It \nwas immediately possible to ask, a little pointedly, what he then thought \n- 19 - \nthe Manor house (all three wings and outbuildings) was made of but not \npossible to point out that the Romans had also made bricks. By and large I \nwould agree with the findings of Moscardo & Pearce (1986) that most \nvisitors felt such sites were realistic. The problem they over-look is that \nthis not a sufficient answer, what has also to be considered is what they \nterm 'the definitional absurdity of denying authenticity to environments \nwhere every effort is spent to achieve this very characteristic' (1986:477). \nWe have to ask, not just whether the promise of a glimpse into the past \ncan be carried off successfully, but what that success may involve. For as \nvisitors seek 'back stage' knowledge, as they become interested and \ncurious, as they seek for insights they almost inevitably push the \ninterpreter into the unknown. The interpreter can then maintain a \nrealistic effect but only at the price of deception about how reliable, not \nhow realistic, that portrait may be (Fortier 1987:5, Enscore 1993). \n \n \nThe Social Life of history. \n \nThis all sounds too pristine, too noble. While the above debates are known \nand discussed they are not the central experiences at events. I want to \nbring in more carnivalesque notions to expand our understanding of \n\"authentic experience\". Earlier the idea of time\/space apart was \nmentioned in terms of history. I would also apply this to the lives of the \nparticipants. For the Tudor re-enactment, people travelled from as far as \nEdinburgh and Wales to take part. Many stayed there three or four \nweeks. Then each day was a routine of breakfast, re-enactment with no \nglasses or watches (obviously), lunch of Tudor cuisine as and when ready. \nLiving on such a site it was quite a shock when the public were admitted - \nI had quickly grown accustomed to the whole being filled with period \n- 20 - \ncostume. It was the public that seemed anachronistic, indeed entry prices \nhave been raised ostensibly to limit the numbers coming so their modern \ndress does not detract from the effect. Later each day there was supper \nfrom the kitchens and then the pub after the visitors left. In the pub it \nwas still a world apart for most were in costume. Then at midnight we \nreturned to sit around a camp-fire with a few more tinnies, smoke and \nchat away the night.  \n \nAs an ethnographer it was very tricky to assess what was going on since \nnot only was I playing a different role from my normal self, but so too, I \nquickly realised, were a large number of other participants. They enjoyed \nthe chance to be different, to be quiet, or to be 'lewd and bawdy', or to be \nexhibitionists in entertainments. Teenagers were let loose away from \nhome with parental blessing in this enclosed environment. Adults took the \njoys of not having the pressures of home. As one teenage boy put it \"I'm \nstaying here on my day off. When I'm at [the Manor] I like to stay in. \nLeave the outside alone.\" I felt this myself with few ways of keeping up on \ncurrent events it was (happily) easy lose touch with the anxieties of \nsupervision\/thesis - though there were underground systems for passing \non cricket test scores. This sense of estrangement from the outside world \nwas added to and reinforced by relations with the outsiders. After several \ndays it was easy to forget that you were in costume - until getting shouts \nof 'hello sailor' in the middle of Bradford reminded you sharply. While re-\nenacting, the tendency to stick within groups was strengthened by the \nperceived hostility and probable foreigness of the area around. This served \nto reinforce the group bonding of re-enactors, which was added to by the \nhours of yarning. For instance civil war musters tended to bring out \ncomparisons with past musters and adumbrations of the latest research \non, say, clothing.  \n- 21 - \n Another ludic aspect must then be worked through. This idea of a \nseparated space licences more possibilities (Stallybrass & White 1986). As \none couple of participants put it:- \n\"I never understand it you talk to these people at musters \nand you would never believe they could hold a responsible \njob.\" A \"That's because you have never understood the switch \noff effect. You see these people on the 5 weekends a year \nwhen they are completely out of control\" G \nThis was most noticeable among the civil war society but has echoed \nelsewhere. This society had had to ban rugby socks initially, indicating \nboth the sort of pleasures sought by some and a determination to become \nmore materially 'authentic'. There was still a huge scale of drinking at \nmajor events. The unit I was with prided itself on being able to turn \nalmost the hardest of stomachs with 'earthy' banter - such as lengthy \ndigressions on the relations of complexities of dress to toilets. These \nsociable 'pleasures' are also a part of living history and are profoundly \nrooted in modern society. But Handler's suggestion that \"buffs expect \nsimulation to deliver an authentic subjective experience\" (1988:339) seems \nto miss the mark. Yes, I hope my continual references have shown that \nthere is some fetishisation of authentic appearance. I must stress that this \nis almost a self-caricature of re-enactors, one of whom announced, on a \nparticularly idyllic day, that they had come over \"all Breughally\". In one \nremark, they combined a sense of documentary sources, their research \n(they were advised to look at period art), of verisimilitude, visual clich\u00e9, \nintertextuality and an ironic self-awareness. The idea that they are dupes \nof the creative anachronisms (actually the name of a US based society), \nthat they do not see it is their modern valuation of this past as worthy \nthat drives the re-enactment, seems bizarre.  \n- 22 - \n  \nConclusions. \n \nWhat I aim to have shown is how some of the dynamics in living history \nsuggest a refashioning of the issues raised in the heritage literature. I \nwould suggest that it is insufficient to focus on images of history that may \nbe discerned in re-enactments. Nor do they conform to an analysis which \nseparates pleasure and learning. Some re-enactments are an 'historical \nlaboratory'. Some aim to provide a chance for participants to learn more \nabout techniques, such as Tudor brickmaking or felt making, they would \notherwise be unable to learn about. At the same time, they aim to \ncommunicate an interpretation to the wider public. In my fieldwork the \npractices of historical research, interpretation and recreation were \nentangled one in the other. Amid all this, the pressure is to move to an \never more rigorous authenticity, as if this will in itself justify living \nhistory; a quest for detail that does perhaps represent an antiquarian \ninclination and a fetishisation of authenticity (Peterson 1988, Handler \n1987:339, Woods 1989, eg Robertshaw 1992). Yet at the same time, this \nauthenticity fetish is both supported and held back by the large numbers \nattracted by the other ludic, good-time aspects of recreations. The \ninteraction of the two can produce both worthwhile and crass historical \nmaterial.  \n \nIt is not enough to simply dismiss recreations as images obscuring an \nunderstanding of 'real' history (whatever that might be) which too quickly \ndegenerates into mutual accusations of inauthenticity. Such accusations \nemploy a decidedly unreflexive idea of authenticity and of the touristic \nprocess. Analysis of performances at these sites reveals much more is \n- 23 - \ngoing on and for multiple audiences. The participants may seek a time \napart, an escape from modern society, but the means whereby they escape \nare entirely modern and very reflexive. Rather than accept the charge of \nseeking an escape into some authorising 'real' period, some will comment \nthat their study of the past has revealed much mythology of the past, \nsome women recounted finding that their Tudor counterparts had more \npowerful roles than they expected and as a consequence have found \nstrength in that knowledge to be more assertive in their own lives. \nTurning to the past may be a strategy to find an authentic experience, but \nmost re-enactors were firmly aware that it was a quest motivated by the \npresent.  \n \nGiven this awareness, the attempt to 'bring the past to life' must be read \nas both shot through with present concerns and reflexively constructed \nabout the present. The reflexivity, even the irony, of the re-enactment \ndoes not render it inauthentic, rather it is what truly marks it as modern \ndrama (Chaney 1993). The 'time apart' was never referred to as 'the past' \namong the re-enactors I observed, the time apart was referred to as 'the \nManor'. The authenticity was not so much found in the past as in the \n'communitas' felt with others equally both trying and admitting the \nimpossibility of ever achieving it. It is this reflexive construction that \nmakes an ironic commentary on playing 'nymphs and swains' in someone \nelse's pastoral myth. To most, but not all re-enactors, these were not so \nmuch 'authentic' people as pleasurably constructed roles. There was an \nimmense level of attention to 'being authentic' defined in terms of \nmaterial accuracy - an obsession not unknown in academia. However, \ncoupled with this was a strong sense of the drama, theatricality and \nartifice - in short a sense not just of the power of the illusion but also of \nthe means used to sustain it (Chaney 1993:22). In marked contrast to this \n- 24 - \ninternal self-knowledge, many re-enactors were painfully aware that \nvisitors often placed them into some periodisation of 'Victorian-Mediaeval-\nprehistoric' (cf. Addyman 1990). One of the stumbling blocks of living \nhistory is visitors assessing realism in terms of previously held notions \nand images (Enscore 1993). It was this that many were trying desperately \nhard to counter by using, perhaps hoping to use, imagination to get to the \nparts traditional historiography had so conspicuously failed to reach. But \nthe tendency to create a suspension of disbelief, the magical realism of a \ndramatic space, for visitors rather than provide the tools of critique means \nthat 'fakelore' or 'Tudorbethan' or whatever myths can be peddled with \nremarkable ease. The great strength of living history is that it attracts \npeople's imagination but there is a great deal of danger for any one who \nsets out to 'delude the public out of their ignorance'. \n \nOne of the reasons for looking to living history is that it problematises \nmany of the categories often used to interpret tourism. Theorising tourism \nhas often remained fixated around the ideas of myths and authenticity. So \noften tourism is equated with commodification and the ruin of \nauthenticity. However, in this case presents a more complex situation \nwhere people attempt to become authentic for tourists; instead of actors \nbecoming tour\u00e9es, we have people like tourists becoming re-enactors, often \nhoping to change tourists ideas of what constitutes a realistic portrayal. \nSuch a process suggests that experiencing a realistic past must be a more \nreflexive process than is often suggested. Touristic realism and knowledge \nabout the past may not be solely defined in terms of verisimilitude, of \nimages, but in terms of a staging process where all actors are entering \ninto the construction of an interpretive frame. The dangers and limits of \nthis 'realism' are best understood as a practice, not by looking to the \ncreation of 'true' or 'false' images. \n- 25 - \n Acknowledgements. \nMany thanks are due to Nigel Thrift, Derek Gregory and Joan Seidl for \nreading earlier versions of this paper and the audiences at the 1994 \nconference of the AAG and Cambridge geography department for their \ncomments.
