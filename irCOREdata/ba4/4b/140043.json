It is now a strategic business function that\nincreasingly recognizes the importance of strategic supplier relationships,\nthe mirror image of key account management. It is time to assess the\nimpact of this shift on the profession and practice of account management.\nThis paper examines customer adoption of strategic procurement and then\ndiscusses the implications this has for account managers at the suppliers\nserving these customers. New techniques are emerging in these special\nrelationships, including the use of psychological contracts and co-\nmeasurement and monitoring. Perceived fairness will also have a major\nimpact on the customer\u2019s view of their suppliers. Account managers must\nrecognize these changes or fall victim to supplier delusion, the belief that\nthey are performing better than they really are.\nKey words: Procurement; key account management; supply chain relationships\nProcurement is big business. A company\u2019s purchases of goods and services can\naccount for 50-70% of total costs (Mcginnis & McCarty, 1998) and form 70-80%\nof the cost of new products in some industries (Minahan & Vigoroso, 2002).\nCoupling the scale of procurement costs with a recent increasing trend for\n2outsourcing entire processes, it is hardly surprising that the purchasing\nprofession is becoming more strategic. In many companies, strategic\nprocurement is now seen as key to competitiveness and Carr & Pearson (2002)\nfind that it has a positive effect on the firm\u2019s financial performance.\nTraditional purchasing is driven by the desire to cut costs of purchase and short-\nterm profit improvement, historically often resulting in supplier proliferation,\ntransactional rather than relationship behavior, and emphasis on price reduction.\nStrategic procurement, by contrast, looks at how the purchasing of goods and\nservices, including outsourcing of entire processes, can deliver better long-term\nshareholder value. Strategic procurement is a very different approach which\ninvolves reducing the supplier base, co-operative negotiation with suppliers,\nquality interaction with suppliers, and developing long-term relationships with the\nbest suppliers. Nevertheless, these strategic procurement behaviors are linked to\nbetter company performance (Swinder & Seshadri, 2001).\nThe process of developing key supplier relationships is the mirror side of Key\nAccount Management. It is now well understood that long-term relationships can\npay off for both customers and suppliers. However, this means abandoning\ntraditional adversarial roles and recognizing that more can be achieved from\nworld-class suppliers if a company behaves like a world-class customer (Morgan,\n1998). In turn, this means offering commitment and having a \u201ccan-do\u201d approach,\nsuch as helping suppliers secure finance by agreeing long-term contracts and\nwork-in-process payments. Just as the key account manager is a boundary\nspanner (McDonald, Rogers & Woodburn, 2000) for the supplier, so is the\npurchasing and supply manager for the customer organization. Strategic\n3procurement managers are now just as committed as key account managers to\nidentifying mutual gain from a key supplier \/ key customer relationship.\nAssumptions about the nature of supplier-customer relationships have changed\nover the past decade. Suspicious win\/lose scenarios are out. The current thinking\nis that buyers and suppliers can have common goals; that there is no need for\ncustomers to have total control; and that transactions are not random and\nepisodic. An example of strategic procurement thinking is provided by Kodak,\nwho developed a successful supplier partnership program based on careful\nsupplier selection and relationship measurement and management (Ellram &\nEdis, 1996). Kodak obtained benefits through lower costs and reduced cycle\ntimes and gained improved solutions through earlier supplier involvement.\nSuppliers benefited from a greater share of Kodak\u2019s business and secure long-\nterm demand from the customer; they also gained competitive strength.\nStrategically-minded procurement managers recognize that supplier partnerships\nare patterns of purposeful behavior that can deliver value to both parties. This\nnew mindset from a traditionally price-driven adversary represents an\nopportunity for suppliers who have key account management capabilities and the\nability to respond. However, there are still underlying supplier-customer\nmismatches to be addressed. For procurement managers, there are two issues in\nmoving towards strategic procurement: how they measure supplier performance;\nand the risk of increasing their dependence upon a smaller number of suppliers.\nFor account managers, an important implication of closer relationships with\nfewer, larger customers is the need for greater proactivity and openness in\nperformance measurement. Second, account managers need a better\n4understanding of key customer profitability and the payback on the relationship\nbecause suppliers, too, encounter risks in dealing with fewer, larger customers.\nCustomer profitability risks have been extensively discussed elsewhere and will\nnot be examined here. Our theme is the additional issues that are generated\nwhen a major customer moves towards strategic procurement. These are the\nproblems of co-measuring a complex business relationship to minimize the risk\ninherent to the customer in supplier dependence.\nThe mirror image: measurement and risk affect\nboth suppliers and customers\nThe risk of dependence impacts both parties to a relationship. Purchasing\ndecision-makers have concerns about dependence on a single source for a key\nproduct or service, but sales managers also need to manage the risk of over-\ndependence on a few strategic customers. Working together in strategic\nsupplier\/customer relationships requires a grasp by both parties of some new\ntools and ways of working together. In particular, the co-measurement and\ndiscussion of performance including the development of trust and both parties\u2019\nperceptions of fairness is essential to the sustainability of mutual benefit from the\nrelationship.\n5The mirror cracked, or Why your customers might walk\naway\nSupplier selection is as strategic to purchasing as customer portfolio analysis is to\nsales management. Just as key account managers focus on understanding\ncustomers\u2019 business needs, purchasers work to understand supplier capabilities.\nThey do this in order to work with the best. Purchasers bear a considerable risk\nmanagement responsibility on behalf of the firm, balancing the trade-off between\ncontrol (usually associated with playing a number of suppliers off each other) and\ndependence (single-sourcing). They need to protect the firm from quality\nmishaps, service deficiencies, and cost over-runs. They have to judge the risk of\nsupplier failure, and keep up with suppliers\u2019 financial health.\nSupplier reduction has been a popular purchasing strategy since the 1980s. Poor\nperformers are dropped, but purchasers see a vested interest in helping their\nbest suppliers to survive and thrive. There are many reasons why customers may\nmove towards single sourcing or supplier concentration, including the need to\nincrease co-ordination in a complex task or process; buffering the firm against\ntechnological uncertainty; and protecting the firm against skill scarcity. Other\ncustomers justify supplier concentration through asset efficiency, cost efficiency,\nbetter customer service, market advantage and profit stability or growth. Which\nsupplier they select is also influenced by the emotional elements of trust and\n6friendship (Figure 1). Essentially, savvy customers now want their key suppliers\nto behave differently.\n[Insert Figure 1 here]\nSingle sourcing or supplier concentration, however, creates vulnerability. For\nexample, the mighty Toyota product line stopped for over a day when a supplier\nhad a factory fire (Bensaou & Anderson, 1999) and on 6th November 2004 the\nFinancial Times reported that Honda had to stop its production line for two days\nbecause an earthquake disrupted component deliveries from supplier Nippon\nSeiki. This is an example of \u2018lock-in\u2019, where single sourcing of certain components\nmakes the customer vulnerable to the supplier\u2019s risk.\nIn managing the trade-off between lock-in and the opportunity for performance\nimprovement through partnership, it is difficult for the purchaser to judge who to\ntrust. Promises of credible commitments such as partnership-specific investments\nare a source of advantage, but also a barrier to exit. Nevertheless, Johnson\nargues that the dependence of a customer on a supplier can have positive\noutcomes where both sides are flexible, the relationship seems durable and there\nis a focus on mutual financial gain. Her research indicates that the right type of\nrelationship delivers benefits regardless of external risk levels. Being \u2018in it\ntogether\u2019 can be an \u2018uncertainty absorption mechanism\u2019 (Johnson, 1999).\n7Holding up the mirror: Changes in supplier\nperformance measurement\nOnce strategic suppliers have been chosen, purchasers are anxious to avoid\nthem getting complacent. Traditionally, the challenge in purchasing has been to\nmeasure supplier performance at all. Whilst 70% of companies surveyed by the\nAberdeen Group in 2002 regarded supplier performance measurement as \u201cvery\nimportant\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d, only half had procedures and typically they were applied\nto less than half the supply base (Minahan & Vigoroso, 2002).\nYet, there is plenty of evidence that, from the customer\u2019s point of view, supplier\nperformance measurement (SPM) works. The Supplier Performance Measurement\nBenchmarking Report from Aberdeen Group in 2002 found that supplier\nperformance improves 26.6% when measured. The hard dollar savings are in the\narea of quality, price, on-time delivery, lower lead times, contract compliance\nand responsiveness (Minahan & Vigoroso, 2002).\nMeasurement needs to pay off because it requires investment, such as the real-\ntime update of the measurement system from legacy applications. Increasingly,\ncustomers demand not just conformance to certain fixed performance measures\nbut also continuous improvement in supplier performance. The on-going\nchallenge is to have a system sophisticated enough to identify hidden costs that\ncan be eliminated. Negotiating a 5% price decrease for a widget is not as\n8effective as larger savings that can be identified through a total cost of ownership\napproach.\nThere is also emerging evidence of a switch towards joint and shared\nperformance measurement between strategic suppliers and their key customers.\nWe will discuss the advantages of co-monitoring later in this paper, but first we\nbriefly consider what traditional measurement systems comprise.\nHow strategic procurement managers measure supplier\nperformance\nCore transactional measures. Vendor analysis systems are not new and\nthe core of any SPM system focuses on three key elements of \u201cvalue for money\u201d\nwhich can be easily measured per transaction. They are price, quality\nconformance and delivery reliability. The latter two are particularly critical to\ncompanies committed to just-in-time manufacturing because, without quality\nconformance and delivery reliability on the part of suppliers, production lines can\nstop.\nOther observers argue that quality is the most important of the three core\ntransactional measures, but that it is delivery that needs most improvement. In\none case study, penalties are charged by the customer for late delivery or parts\nrejected (Carbone, 2004). Unfortunately, even at this apparently objective level\nof measurement, misunderstandings can arise. For example, suppliers can\n9assume that a part-delivery is conforming to customer requirements because it is\non time, although incomplete; whereas the customer treats the order as\nunfulfilled until complete.\nAs such examples demonstrate, for any one buying company the three core\ntransactional elements may vary in importance. For example, logistics decision-\nmakers are likely to demand an in-depth analysis of quality, because the\ncustomer service capabilities of a contractor are more important than cost.\nHowever, it is clear that there are contradictions and trade-offs in this triad of\ncore transactional elements. For certain kinds of customer or situation, quality or\nearly delivery may command a higher price for the supplier. One of the\ndevelopments in strategic approaches to procurement is the use by some\nsophisticated customers of multi-objective programming decision support\nsystems to work out the balance they want to achieve.\nTransaction-related satisfaction is essentially a \u2018hygiene factor\u2019, although it may\nlead to high perceptions of supplier quality. For example, Dow Corning launched\na sub-branded e-channel in 2002 for its cost-conscious customers call Xiameter.\nOffering standard quantities, qualities and lead times, customer who wanted a\nbasic package could order just that (Gary, 2005). However, suppliers should note\nthat quality perceptions are also affected by relative performance compared to\ncompetitors, the level of customer involvement in, or knowledge of, the\nproduct\/service type, and changing expectations of \u201cstandard\u201d quality over time.\nIncreasingly, customers are demanding not just core transaction excellence, but\nalso service excellence from their suppliers. The Xiameter model assumed that\ncustomers who opted for it had their own chemical engineers to apply the\n10\nproduct; yet many companies during the 1990s downsized their own expertise in\nfavor of supplier expertise.\nService. Research shows that, close on the heels of the core transactional\nmeasures in buyers\u2019 requirements, was responsiveness. In fact, companies\nstudied by Billesbach, Harrison & Croom-Morgan (1991) rated response flexibility\nhigher than price. Responsiveness is one of the main areas in which account\nmanagers can enhance customer satisfaction, who are often seen as a single\npoint of contact for key buying decision-makers. This perception of\nresponsiveness is the first subjective measure to appear in the \u2018balanced\nscorecard\u2019 used by strategic procurement managers. The more sophisticated ones\nhave even developed measures of responsiveness, such as time to answer phone\ncalls but, in many cases, it is likely that it is the subjective views of the\nprocurement manager that are recorded.\nService also encompasses technical support. The importance of technical support\nis dependent on the type of product\/service bought and the skills level of the\nbuying firm. Although overall technical support was allocated medium importance\nin the Billesbach study, it is high for some companies and product types. The\nscope of support can also be important, as some companies may require\ntechnical support to a wide geographical spread of branches. Performance\nguarantees for problem resolution are increasingly expected, and suppliers can\neasily be measured against these.\nThe shift towards customer problem resolution is the mirror side of solutions\nselling. The past ten years has seen a shift towards solution selling. On the\n11\ncustomer side, there have also been signs of change. Krause & Ellram (1997)\nreported research results indicating that customers who committed to pro-active\nand long-term supplier development, including high levels of communication,\ncontinuous improvement of processes between the firms and investment in\nimproved operations enjoyed better overall performance from their suppliers.\nOther authors (Kneymeyer et al, 2003; Fisher, 2004) have noticed how these\nfactors are being monitored. Their relevance to purchasing professionals appears\nto be increasing. Despite the difficulties of measuring intangible and subjective\nfactors, broader measures are now used on supplier scorecards\nProcess-based. Most companies will be concerned with a supplier\u2019s safety\nrecord, and be keen to see evidence that safety is built into their processes as\nwell as products. But, beyond this hygiene factor, buying decision-makers are\nincreasingly looking for process innovation from suppliers, either through offering\nturnkey services, such as flexible logistics or vendor-managed inventory (the\nsupplier takes responsibility for the customer\u2019s stock management), problem-\nsolving and trouble-shooting cross-boundary processes to reduce errors.\nMcDonald et al (1995), observed a number of examples, most notably the\nsuccess of a logistics company (supplier) working with a mail order company\n(customer). Both parties collaborated in continuously mapping their cross-\nboundary processes to identify efficiency improvements and cost savings. The\nsavings were invested in co-branding the streamlined service to end customers.\nCompany-based. Although primarily considered at supplier selection\nstage, buying decision-makers know that they have to keep abreast of the\ncorporate health of their suppliers. Ellram\u2019s research suggests that cultural\n12\ncompatibility, long term plans, financial stability and technological capability\nshould be periodically checked (Ellram, 1991). For example, Global Healthcare\nExchange (GHX) is an electronic market place set up by medical supply\ncompanies to serve the US and now the UK healthcare market. It aims to replace\na plethora of systems and provide a cheaper and more effective approach. GHX\nhas proved attractive to UK hospitals not only because of its US track record and\nperceived financial and technological strength, but also because its key founding\nconcepts of neutrality, confidentiality, equality and efficiency appeal to UK\nhospitals operating under National Health Service principles (Mouncey, McDonald\n& Ryals, 2004).\nCommunications. All commentators on the success of supplier\/buyer\nrelationships agree that \u201cprofusion\u201d of communication is absolutely critical. As\nwith key account management, purchasing academics note the need for a parallel\nrelationship structure, in other words, communication between firms at all points\nof contact. Fisher (2004) gives an outstanding best practice example of Nortel\u2019s\n\u2018customer fulfillment network\u2019, a web-based portal to add intelligence to the\nsupply chain by enabling communications between all players, not just two.\nCommunication can be evaluated and measured at many levels. The quality of\ntransacting information, which may include layout of invoices, is one thing.\nInterorganizational systems that exchange and integrate information to support\ndecision-making can reduce costs and enhance market responsiveness.\n13\nHowever, measurement is also made on the judgment of interpersonal skills. Is\nthe supplier pro-active? Can the supplier\u2019s representative negotiate and\nrenegotiate when the unforeseen happens? Can supplier and buyer share\ninformation, acknowledge each other\u2019s perspective, exchange resources, offer\nsupport, and have an open discussion utilizing high quality reasoning? Is each\nexpert in the decision-making unit matched with an expert in the supplier?\nRelationship. Research with buying decision-makers makes clear that\nsatisfactory performance on hygiene factors does not necessarily lead to loyalty\nto a supplier. However, relationship quality is correlated with customer retention.\nThus, good customer relationships pay off. Successive reports and books by\nMcDonald et al. (1995; 1999; 2000) note the importance of suppliers gaining a\ndeep understanding of the customer\u2019s strategy and planning to contribute to the\ncustomer\u2019s achievement of it. Best practice suppliers invest time and money in\ntheir key relationships, creating a \u2018spiral\u2019 of positive results for both parties.\nA customer also needs to be confident that the supplier will not act\nopportunistically. Commitment is key; it is about working at developing the\nrelationship and \u2018resisting the short-term\u2019 (Kneymeyer, Corsi & Murphy, 2003).\nSuppliers can demonstrate their commitment to a customer by offering additional\nservices that will contribute to the development of a mutually beneficial\npartnership. In other studies, customers have expressed admiration for suppliers\nwho share ideas and initiatives and improve processes capabilities to match\ncustomer needs. Customers expect suppliers to identify with their goals and\nanticipate future needs. With these factors in place, trust can build.\n14\nInvestment. Once a supplier is trusted as a partner, the relationship with the\ncustomer usually moves towards joint investments, such as jointly managing\nassets used in the relationship (machinery, vehicles, etc.). The most valuable\nform of co-operation is the early involvement of suppliers in new product design\nand development, which has been shown to deliver significant quality\nimprovements that feed throughout the supply chain to the end-consumer.\nLucent bring in their strategic suppliers at the design phase of new products. This\nmeans that they can influence architecture and analyze the impact of new\nproduct concepts on their own costs, which helps Lucent to design costs out of\nnew products (Carbone, 2002). When organizational commitment reaches these\nlevels, measurement is needed to monitor trust and the quality of the\nrelationship. The implications for account managers are explored in the following\nsection.\nLooking In the Mirror: What Does This Mean For\nAccount Managers?\nSupplier performance measurement from the customer side is changing as\nstrategic procurement becomes more of a force in supplier\/ customer\nrelationships. Meanwhile, what are suppliers measuring about their performance\nwith customers? Increased customer sophistication on the procurement side\nneeds to be met with increased effectiveness not just in delivering customer\nservice but in being seen to do so.\n15\nHow suppliers assess their own performance\nThe history of success with customers for many decades was linked primarily to\nsales volume. Bigger was better. Customer revenues were easy to measure, and\nsalespeople were paid on them. In recent years, more measures are in use such\nas order size, repeatability, standardization, timeliness of orders (coming in),\npricing terms, price structure, accuracy of specifications, schedule for delivery,\nand credit taken. Ultimately the supplier is looking for indicators of customer\nprofitability, which is notoriously difficult to measure. However, customer\nprofitability analysis is now recognized as a vital measure for marketing,\nespecially as analysis of relationships between suppliers and their key customers\nshows that they do not pay off for suppliers unless carefully managed.\nMost companies try to have some measure of customer satisfaction as well. This\nneeds to be measured objectively, as salesperson or account manager feedback\nis notoriously bad as an indicator of customer satisfaction. Unfortunately for\nsuppliers, the results from satisfaction surveys seem to be of limited usefulness.\nCustomers tend to give overly flattering reports about their suppliers; most\ncustomer satisfaction surveys show bias towards the top two satisfaction ratings\n(excellent and good). Still worse, satisfaction is a poor indicator of repurchase;\ncustomer loyalty is only 75% even at the highest levels of satisfaction (Sharma,\n1997; 2000).\n16\nUltimately, what the customer perceives is the only indicator of success and\nrepurchase. Therefore, smart account managers will discuss with their key\ncustomers what it is that the customer actually measures about the supplier\u2019s\nperformance. The good news: strategic purchasers are willing to share their\nviews and the data on which they are based.\nThrough the looking glass: Emerging evaluation\ntechniques in key relationships\nNew techniques are emerging in close relationships between suppliers and their\nsophisticated key accounts. Where strategic procurement is concerned, this is no\nlonger an adversarial, zero-sum relationship. It is no longer \u2018we win, the other\nside loses\u2019. Instead, the name of the new game is working together on shared\nmeasurement and on joint initiatives to reduce the costs or improve business\nefficiency on both sides. New concepts include psychological contracts and\nfairness, as well as co-monitoring of the relationship by both parties.\nPsychological contracts and perceptions of fairness\nThe goal of strategic purchasers is not to beat up suppliers, but to get them to be\neasy to work with. Being \u201ceasy to do business with\u201d has long been known as a\ncritical success factor for key account strategy (McDonald, Millman & Rogers,\n1995). It is recognized that there is a need to give suppliers an understanding of\n17\nrequired performance, the consequences of failure, and to offer rewards for\nexcellence. Thus, customers need to ensure transparency on bids and schedules,\nset accurate and timely specifications, and give clear evaluation of supplier\nperformance.\nBlancero & Ellram (1997) look at the psychological contract between the\ndecision-makers in both organizations. Psychological contracts are not the formal,\nwritten contracts that are usually put in place where one or both parties wants to\nclarify what happens if the relationship breaks down. Formal contracts tend to\ndeal with penalties, guarantees and litigation. By contrast, psychological\ncontracts are about the positive expectations of the relationship and perceptions\nof reciprocity. Clarifying the views about what is expected out of the relationship\non both sides can help avoid issues of perceived unfairness. Perception is not\nalways accurate. Buyers perceive that they meet top supplier managers more\noften than they do, and that they give more information to them than they do!\nBuyers think that they do more relationship building than suppliers think they do.\nAnd suppliers think that they fulfill their contractual obligations better than they\ndo.\nAs in other strategic business relationships, the principle of organizational justice\ncomes into play \u2013 can both parties believe that judgment is fair? Psychological\ncontracts can be violated, because expectations change or are not met, although\nthe violator is not always aware that the violation has taken place. In fact,\nblatant violation is rare. The cause of the violation may be a misunderstanding\n(perhaps arising from complacency) or disruption caused by an external event.\nMcDonald, Millman & Rogers found that \u201cbreach of trust\u201d was the primary cause\n18\nfor customers to disengage with suppliers, and the purchasing decision-makers\ninterviewed could cite apparently tangible examples such as missed deliveries or\nlack of support. Nevertheless, as noted earlier, even tangible events give rise to\nalternative interpretations, so how can the existence of trust or lack of it be\nmeasured? Both parties must be prepared to share their perceptions frequently\n\u2013 formally as well as informally.\nDo supplier and customer decision-makers meet to resolve problems, or does the\ncustomer just strike the supplier off the list? Suppliers will perceive fairness if\nthere is a process and procedure to resolve disputes which is consistent, accurate\nand ethical. Fairness encourages companies to behave well. Blancero & Ellram\nconclude that fairness involves both parties assessing and exchanging\ninformation, sharing benefits, a degree of personal sensitivity and maintaining\nbelief in the on-going relationship. Humphries & Wilding (2004) demonstrate that\nsoft factors such as co-operation, co-ordination and collaboration can be\nmeasured from the perspective of the buyer and of the seller in supply chain\nrelationships. The resulting analysis enables both parties to share perceptions of\ntheir relationship.\nA model for co-monitoring of strategic relationships\nA critical aspect of supplier\/customer trust that the authors have noted from\nexperience with Cranfield\u2019s Key Account Management Best Practice Club is both\nparties discussing and agreeing the nature of their relationship and whether or\n19\nnot there is potential for further development. In the model illustrated in Table\n1, we have used a hierarchy of supplier\/customer relationships to set a\nframework for analyzing current position and potential and co-monitoring of\nrelevant performance categories. This model draws upon earlier relational\ndevelopment models (Millman & Wilson, 1994) as well as Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of\nneeds, which we see as analogous to the hierarchy of needs of those managing\nsupplier\/customer relationships. This simple model is designed to facilitate initial\ndialogue between suppliers and customers. Suppliers and customer may design\ntheir own checklists and agendas for regular and on-going dialogue or use\nindustry standards. For example, the UK Ministry of Defence encourages the use\nof the \u201cSupply Chain Relationships In Aerospace\u201d (SCRIA) program for its supply\nchain (Lamming & Cousins, 1999). SCRIA, which enables strategic partnering\nthroughout the UK defense industry, has been in operation for seven years.\nNearly all prime defense contractors are participating to achieve savings and\nefficiencies throughout the aerospace supply chain. The overall aim is to make\nthe supply chain lean. Measurement is a key element; it is perceived that \u2018blame\u2019\napproaches add cost and that collaborative measurement and risk sharing reduce\noperational, managerial and strategic costs. SCRIA obviously has the advantage\nof a very powerful end-customer driving co-operation throughout the supply\nchain.\n[Insert Table 1 here]\nA supplier and customer may work successfully together for many years at the\n\u2018basic\u2019 level, provided that the customer\u2019s expectations of price, quality and\ndelivery performance are understood and met by the supplier. Suppliers of non-\n20\ncritical products such as office supplies may never be monitored beyond this\nlevel, although a performance review of the actual and psychological contracts is\nstill occasionally necessary to ensure that the supplier sustains competitiveness\nand does not become complacent.\nComplacency on the part of the incumbent supplier is perhaps the biggest risk to\nthe concept of partnering and procurement directors are well aware of the\ndanger. Roger Whittier, Director of Purchasing, Intel Corp, quoted on\nwww.purchasing.com, commented \u201ccomplacency does creep in if you do not\ncarefully watch it. External benchmarking and occasional testing of the waters by\nutilizing competition is required. If you do not do this, in the end your supplier\nwill become uncompetitive and then you will slowly also lose your competitive\nadvantage.\u201d\nWhere the relationship is \u2018integrated\u2019 and a substantial service, support and\ncommunications element is involved, more subjectivity in performance appraisal\nis inevitable. For example in the implementation of IT applications, line managers\nor technicians may not be aware of the depth of users\u2019 frustrations. Both parties\nshould monitor these categories, and if either has technology that records\ncontacts automatically (e.g. call management) that information should be shared.\nFeelings about the quality of call handlers\u2019 listening skills or engineers\u2019 dedication\nare not so easy to capture. Discussions of expectations and perceptions should\noccur at least monthly, and with a wide group of decision-makers and\ninfluencers.\n21\n\u2018Interdependence\u2019 is normally accompanied by efforts to improve cross-boundary\nprocesses and monitor the overall quality of the relationship. It is often at this\nstage that customers in particular look for an exchange of ideas as well as\ninformation and data. Customers who invest time in supplier development in\nreturn for their key account status expect closeness to result in additional\ntangible benefits, although these will be more difficult to measure. For example,\navoidance of hidden costs from improving to robustness a process that had been\nbreaking down can often only be estimated. The detail involved in supplier and\ncustomer personnel working together at many levels should ensure frequent\nchecking of perceptions of fairness. Nevertheless, the key account manager and\nkey purchasing decision-maker should be consistently gathering and comparing\nfeedback.\nSome practitioners have commented to the authors that the only truly\ntransparent supplier\/customer partnership is a joint venture. Although not always\nformalized as a JV, some supplier\/customer relationships do involve the\nintegration of functions. Integration involves significant risk for both parties and\ntherefore requires formal planning and monitoring of return on investment. Since\nthe value of any arrangement will change over time and the focus of either party\nmay drift, pro-active monitoring of perceptions of trust and fairness is still\nadvisable. Supplier\/customer relationships are commercial, not personal, and a\nmutually agreeable exit strategy will be part of their trustworthiness.\n22\nKey account managers, please note\u2026\nFor some time now, it has been known that supplier performance management\nprovides benefits for the customer organization. However, in an era of developing\nstrategic procurement, different measures of the relationship are becoming\nappropriate and more sophisticated systems can be instrumental in tracking the\nbenefits of supplier\/customer partnerships. Continuous tracking is now vital, as\nstrategic customers now demand not just a high level of performance but also\ncontinuous improvement. Smart account managers are beginning to understand\nthat openness with customers, exchanging performance data and even co-\nmonitoring may identify further efficiencies and cost-savings as cross-boundary\nprocesses and relationship quality are examined.\n\u2026 you may be suffering from supplier delusion\nBuying decision makers \u2013 strategic procurement directors \u2013 have said that they\nstill perceive \u2018supplier delusion\u2019 to be a problem. This is where the supplier thinks\nit is performing better than it really is, in the customer\u2019s view. To be truly\nsuccessful at relationship management and customer retention, account\nmanagers must take supplier performance measurement very seriously.\nEngaging cross-boundary measurement and discussion of measurement should\nbe very beneficial to relationship-building.\n23\nReferences\nBensaou, B.
