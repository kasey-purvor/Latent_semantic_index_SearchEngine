INTRODUCTION\nThe magic numbers 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126 are\nindicators of the shell structure of nuclei. If a nucleus has a\nmagic number of either protons or neutrons then discontinui-\nties will be observed in two-particle separation energies at\nsuch systems. When both N and Z correspond to a magic\nnumber, the nucleus is deemed to be doubly magic.\nBy analogy, one can conceive of doubly midshell nuclei,\nwhich is to say those in which N and Z lie exactly halfway\nbetween consecutive magic numbers. While one might not\nexpect to see a discontinuity in observables across this mid-\nshell point, it has been demonstrated that the product of pro-\nton and neutron valence particles or holes NpNn outside\nclosed shells correlates monotonically with various collec-\ntive properties of nuclei, such as the energy of the first 2+\nexcited state in even-even nuclei, the energy ratio of the first\n4+ to the first 2+ state and the BsE2:01\n+\u219221+d [1]. On the other\nhand, saturation of BsE2d values is known to occur with\nslightly fewer particles than at the midshell for rare-earth\nnuclei [2], due to microscopic effects beyond the remit of the\nNpNn scheme.\nIn our recent Brief Report [3] calculations were made of\nthe properties of the doubly midshell nucleus 66\n170Dy104 using\nthe total Routhian surface (TRS) and configuration-\nconstrained potential energy surface (PES) methods. Based\non NpNn systematics, it was suggested that 170Dy should be\namongst the most quadrupole collective of nuclei with re-\nspect to the ground state configuration, since it maximizes\nNpNn=16322=352 for all nuclei below the doubly-magic\n208Pb. The results of the PES calculations in Ref. [3] suggest\nthat 170Dy is well deformed in its ground state with b2\n=0.29 and g=0\u00b0 with a very stiff potential in both b and g\ndegrees of freedom. The TRS results which used a cranked\nnonaxially deformed Woods Saxon mean field showed a\nmarked constancy in the deformation up to rotational fre-\nquencies of at least v=0.3 MeV\/\". The simultaneous align-\nment of both protons and neutrons was predicted to occur\nstarting at \"v<0.35 MeV , corresponding to Ix<14\". The\ndeep axially symmetric minimum also led to the suggestion\nthat the Kp=6+ two-quasineutron isomer in 170Dy could have\na lifetime of the order of hours.\nOther recent theoretical work on the excitation spectrum\nof 170Dy includes tilted axis cranked Hartree-Fock-\nBoguliubov (HFB) calculations [4] which predicted a con-\nstancy of the quadrupole and triaxial deformations from the\nground state up to approximately spin 20\". A systematic\nstudy using x- and z-axis cranked HFB of 164\u2013170Dy by Yadav\net al. [5] predicts the maximum deformation in Dy isotopes\nto occur at N=100 s166Dyd and shows a slow change in b and\ng deformation as spin increases.\nIn this paper we build upon our previous studies [3,4] by\nexploring isotopes in the region of 170Dy using self-\nconsistent approaches. In Sec. II, results and discussion of\nSkyrme-(HF) Hartree-Fock calculations of ground-state\nproperties of dysprosium isotopes from A=160 to A=180 are\npresented. Section III details the formalism of the projected\nHF calculations, the results of which are presented and dis-\ncussed in Sec. IV. We summarize the work in Sec. V.\nII. SKYRME HARTREE-FOCK CALCULATIONS\nUsing a variety of Skyrme parametrizations, HF calcula-\ntions of dysprosium isotopes between N=94 and N=114\nhave been performed. The parametrizations chosen were SIII\n[6], SkM* [7], SkI4 [8] and SLy4 [9]. SIII has proved ca-\npable of describing nuclei in a wide range of the nuclear\nchart [10]. In common with other early Skyrme parametriza-\ntions, SIII was fitted to the properties of spherical, doubly\nmagic nuclei. SkM* is a modification of a previous force,\nSkM [11], modified to account for the fission barrier in 240Pu.\nSkI4 adds an extra (isospin) degree of freedom to the spin-\norbit functional to improve the quality of reproduction of\nisotope shifts and as such is also a suitable choice for study-\ning isotopic trends. The most recent Skyrme parametrization\nused here is SLy4, which was fitted to the equation of state\nof pure neutron matter as well as doubly magic nuclei, and\ntherefore represents a good candidate for calculation of neu-\ntron rich systems. The present calculations assumed axial\nsymmetry with and without a constraint on the expectation\nvalue of the quadrupole moment, which allows us to view\nthe potential energy surface as a function of b2, or alterna-\ntively allows the local minimum to be found. A unified pair-\ning prescription was used for each interaction consisting of a\nPHYSICAL REVIEW C 68, 044315 (2003)\n0556-2813\/2003\/68(4)\/044315(8)\/$20.00 \u00a92003 The American Physical Society68 044315-1\ntruncated space delta interaction in the BCS approximation.\nThe results of the pairing calculations were also checked\nusing a density-dependent interaction, which has been pro-\nposed particularly for use in very neutron rich nuclei [12,13].\nThe results for each of the Skyrme parametrizations were\nbroadly similar. The binding energy results can be seen in\nFig. 1. The upper panel shows the absolute binding energy\nper nucleon, while the lower panel shows the two-neutron\nseparation energies. The binding energies are seen to be very\nslightly s,0.75%d lower than experimental values, and the\nobserved two-neutron separation energies are closely brack-\neted by the different Skyrme parametrizations.\nOf specific interest in the context of collective behaviour\nand the potential for long-lived K isomers is the prediction of\naxially symmetric quadrupole deformations of isotopes of\ndysprosium in the vicinity of 170Dy. The upper panel of Fig.\n2 shows the ground-state deformation predicted by the vari-\nous forces, which are also tabulated in Table I. The central\npanel shows the energy difference between the local oblate\nminimum and the global prolate minimum. The lower panel\nshows the deformation energy, which is the increase in bind-\ning of the true deformed ground state compared to a con-\nstrained spherical solution. It should be pointed out that these\ncalculations do not include the possibility of triaxial sgd de-\nformation, so what appears as an oblate minimum in these\naxially deformed calculations is actually a saddle point.\nSince the nuclei near 170Dy are expected to be softer in g\nthan in b [3], effects such as shape coexistence and the ex-\ntent to which the deformation energy is a measure of the\nrobustness of the prolate deformation are not possible to de-\ntermine from an axially deformed calculation alone. How-\never, as one follows the decreasing of the oblate-prolate en-\nergy difference and the deformation energy with increasing\nA, one can attempt to predict when b softness will become\nan important effect.\nAll the forces show the same general behavior, with the\nmaximum quadrupole deformation occurring in 166Dy (SkI4\nand SLy4) or 168Dy (SkM* and SIII). The maximum defor-\nmation energy occurs in 168Dy (SkI4 and SIII) or 170Dy\n(SkM* and SLy4). The difference in energy between the ob-\nlate and the prolate minima is largest in either 166Dy (SkI4\nand SLy4) or 168Dy (SkM* and SIII). The reliability of the\nchosen Skyrme parametrizations is confirmed by the excel-\nlent agreement between calculated and experimentally de-\nrived b2 values [14].\nThe different Skyrme forces show only minor differences\nand one can conclude that, as expected, the even-even dys-\nprosium isotopes between A=160 and A=180 are all well\ndeformed with b2 between 0.24 and 0.36.

The stiffness of the potential well, as\nmeasured by the deformation energy reinforces the results of\nthe TRS calculations [3] which suggest a stable deformation\nup to rather high spin.\nPairing can play an important role in determining defor-\nmation, acting as it does towards sphericity. In the case of the\nnuclei in the present study, increasing the pairing strength\nwithin reasonable limits has little effect upon the deforma-\ntion. The stability of the results was tested against a large\ns40%d increase in the pairing strengths in 160Dy with SkI4\nand found a very small s,1%d effect on the deformation. In\naddition, the density-dependent delta pairing interaction\n[10,12] was used with the SkI4 force to check that the results\nwere not strongly dependent on the assumed form of the\npairing interaction or the details of its strength within reason-\nable limits. It was found that the predictions for the greatest\ndeformation, deformation energy and oblate-prolate differ-\nence and the qualitative isotopic trends were unchanged by\nthe change in pairing interaction.\nIII. DEFORMED HARTEE-FOCK CALCULATION AND\nANGULAR-MOMENTUM PROJECTION\nTo complement the Skyrme HF calculations of the ground\nstates, calculations using HF plus angular-momentum projec-\ntion (AMP) were performed using a residual interaction to\nexamine excited states. In performing a deformed Hartree-\nFock calculation as a prelude to a shell-model-like mixing of\nconfigurations, a substantial part of the residual interaction\namong nucleons in shell-model orbits is included in the de-\nformed field and one needs only a few particle-hole configu-\nrations to obtain an adequate description of the low-energy\nproperties of nuclei.\nThe axially deformed HF states are expanded in spherical\nbasis states\nuaml = o\nj\nCjm\na ujml . s1d\nThe mixing amplitudes of the spherical states form the\nvariational parameters that are solved for in the HF equations\nby iteration, starting with an appropriate intrinsic state. When\na converged solution is obtained, one has the mixing ampli-\ntudes for the deformed orbits of protons and neutrons, HF\nsingle-particle energies, and the density matrix r. Various\nquantities, such as the HF energy, multipole moments, etc.,\nare obtained using the density matrix and the HF single-\nparticle energies [17].\nProlate HF calculations for the valence nucleons lying\noutside the 132Sn core were performed for the even-even\n160\u2013170Dy isotopes using the surface-delta residual interaction\n[18,19] (with strength 0.3 MeV for p-p, p-n, and n-n inter-\nactions) within a model space of one major shell each for\nprotons and neutrons. Spherical Nilsson basis states were\nused. The 3s1\/2, 2d3\/2, 2d5\/2, 1g7\/2, 1h9\/2, and 1h11\/2 proton\nbasis states have energies 3.863 84, 3.562 74, 1.304 68,\n0.602 13, 7.184 59, and 2.216 86 MeV, and the 3p1\/2, 3p3\/2,\n2f5\/2, 2f7\/2, 1h9\/2, and 1i13\/2 neutron basis states have energies\n4.230 14, 2.849 16, 3.312 19, 0.089 90, 0.923 36, and\n1.714 93 MeV, respectively.\nThe resulting HF orbits are doubly degenerate and are\nlabeled by the V quantum number, the sum of which for the\noccupied unpaired orbits gives the K value. Since the Fermi\nsurface is surrounded by large-V orbits for the nuclides un-\nder study (see Fig. 3 for the HF orbits for 170Dy), high-K\nband structures built upon these single-particle states are\nlikely to be observed. The HF field for these high-K bands\n(with many large-V excitations) does not possess time rever-\nsal symmetry [20].\nThe HF orbits form a deformed-shell-model basis for the\nnuclei under consideration, and they contain information\nabout the nuclear structure dynamics and its variation with\nrespect to angular momentum and other important param-\neters needed for the study of the collective states of the\nnucleus. Essentially each HF configuration shows the intrin-\nsic distribution of the valence nucleons in the deformed-\nshell-model orbits. For example, the HF configurations\nshown in Fig. 3 correspond to the ground-state intrinsic con-\nfiguration in 170Dy. For excited states the intrinsic distribu-\ntion changes and this is taken into account by considering\nvarious HF configurations (see Table III) for the study of the\nyrast and yrare spectra. By appropriate nucleon excitations,\nthe rotation-aligned (RAL) K=1 structure and the high-K\nconfigurations are selected for angular-momentum projec-\ntion.\nIn contrast to the large number s<100d of configurations\nneeded in the projected shell model [21] for understanding\nthe yrast spectra, it is found that angular-momentum projec-\ntion from a few low-lying HF configurations gives a reason-\nable description of the yrast structure. This is due to the fact\nthat the residual interaction has been used in the solution of\nthe HF equations, so that the HF single-particle states and the\nvarious multiparticle configurations built from them are al-\nready closer to the final answer that comes from a full solu-\ntion of the many-body Schr\u00f6dinger equation [22]. In fact\nAMP from a single K configuration reproduces the energy\nfeatures of the low-lying yrast states with good accuracy (see\nFig. 4 for 160\u2013168Dy). The current work specifically concen-\ntrates on low-lying excitations which give rise to high-K and\nlow-K (RAL) configurations in 170Dy.\nFIG. 3. The prolate Hartree-Fock single-particle orbits for pro-\ntons and neutrons are shown for 170Dy. The time reversed s\u00b1Vd\norbits are doubly degenerate. The solid and dashed lines correspond\nto the positive and negative parity orbits, respectively. The asterisks\nguide the eye to the Fermi surface which lies amidst high V orbits.\nSELF-CONSISTENT DESCRIPTION OF DYSPROSIUM\u0085 PHYSICAL REVIEW C 68, 044315 (2003)\n044315-3\nEach HF configuration uFlK is a superposition of states of\ngood angular momentum.

NEAR YRAST STRUCTURE OF 170Dy FROM PHF\nCALCULATIONS\nA. Ground state properties of 160\u2013170Dy\nProlate deformed HF calculations were performed for\n160\u2013170Dy. The prolate HF orbits for 170Dy are shown in Fig.\n3. The quadrupole and hexadecapole moments for the prolate\nsolutions are shown for all the nuclei in Table II. For com-\nparison with other calculations, the ground-state b2 deforma-\ntions have been extracted and are listed in Table I. Amongst\nthe calculated isotopes, 168Dy was predicted to have the\nmaximum b2 deformation. This is in qualitative agreement\nwith the results of Sec. II, and with previous calculations\n[3,5,31] showing that this projected HF approach gives rea-\nsonable single-particle structure, which is the main determi-\nnant of deformation in a mean-field picture. As such it pro-\nvides a good starting point for the study of excited states in a\nfully self-consistent framework. AMP from the ground-state\nHF configurations for the 160\u2013168Dy nuclei gives a reasonable\nreproduction of the low-lying yrast states (see Fig. 4). The\nsize and variation in the neutron hexadecapole deformation\nare noticeable in the isotopic chain. It decreases and becomes\nnegative with increasing neutron number [32,33].\nFIG. 4.

Band crossings in 170Dy and band mixing\nSince the ph11\/2 and ni13\/2 orbits are half filled in\n168,170Dy, these nuclei are found to be well deformed and\nhence rich rotational band structures are expected.\nTo find the relative importance of different K-intrinsic\nstructures, band-mixing calculations were performed among\n19 bands, including the K=0+ ground band. The intrinsic\nconfigurations for the bands were obtained by particle-hole\nexcitations from the HF ground state. These configurations,\nlisted in Table III, can be classified into three types: (i) Low-\nK RAL, (ii) high-K deformation aligned (DAL) and (iii) K\n=0, 2p-2h pairing type excitations. For example, considering\nthe states either side of the neutron Fermi surface (see Fig.\n3), one could have (i) excitation of a neutron from 7\/2+ to\n9\/2+ giving rise to a K=1+ RAL structure, (ii) excitation of\nneutron from \u22125\/2\u2212 to 7\/2\u2212 giving a high-K=6+ state, and\nfinally (iii) promotion of a pair of neutrons from \u00b15\/2\u2212 to\n\u00b17\/2\u2212 state giving rise to a Kp=0+ configuration. Particle-\nhole excitations of the above types (i, ii, and iii) involving\nthe ni13\/2 and ph11\/2 single-particle states and their linear\ncombinations lead to 18 configurations (six configurations of\neach type). These were mixed with the ground-state configu-\nration to obtain the yrast and yrare states. Mixing of K=0\nconfigurations involving 2p-2h pairing-type excitations is\nfound to be important in understanding the high spin spec-\ntroscopy in general and excitation energies of the high-K\nstructures in particular. This is one way of accounting for\npairing in the HF formalism, preserving the particle number.\nIt is illuminating to examine the behavior of these various\nbands before the mixing takes place to get an idea of com-\npetition between structures and to more fully appreciate the\neffects of the mixing. Since 170Dy is well deformed and the\nunique parity high-j orbits, such as ph11\/2 and ni13\/2, are ap-\nproximately half filled, one may be able to see competition\nbetween these single-particle orbits to dominate the yrast\nstructure. The ph11\/2 shell is exactly half filled with the pro-\nton Fermi surface lying in between the 5\/2\u2212 and 7\/2\u2212 sub-\nstates. The neutron Fermi surface is in between V=7\/2+ and\n9\/2+ substates of the i13\/2 shell which is slightly more than\nhalf filled. Both protons and neutrons can undergo Coriolis\nmixing and so compete in rotational alignment to cause back\nbending. One-proton excitation from 5\/2\u2212 to 7\/2\u2212 gives rise\nto a K=1+, sph11\/2d2 rotation-aligned configuration. Similarly,\na one-neutron p-h excitation from 7\/2+ to 9\/2+ state gives\nrise to the K=1+, sni13\/2d2 rotation-aligned configuration.\nAngular-momentum projection from these intrinsic struc-\ntures gives the corresponding s bands which are easily dis-\ntinguished by their energy staggering between odd and even\nspins. These bands along with rotational band structures ob-\ntained by AMP from the set of low-lying HF configurations\n(listed in Table III) are shown in Fig. 5. From the PHF cal-\nculations, it is found that both ph11\/2 and ni13\/2 RAL bands\nsimultaneously compete with the Kp=0+ ground band. These\nRAL bands appear to cross the K=0 ground state at around\nI=14 \" and another band crossing is found at around I\n=22 \" when the K=2+ intrinsic structure with the joint align-\nment of the ph11\/2 and ni13\/2 apparently becomes yrast. In the\nPHF calculation the K=6+ and K=14+ bandheads appear to\nbe yrast at I=6 and I=14 , respectively. However, after band\nmixing, these structures are pushed up in energy and domi-\nnate the yrare structure. The details of the high-K band struc-\ntures are discussed in the following section. The yrast and\nyrare states obtained after band mixing are shown in Fig. 6.\nFigure 7 shows the K distribution in the yrast even-spin\nstates. The band-mixing results indicate that there is indeed a\nTABLE III.

The contribu-\ntion from other K=0 components (arising from pair excita-\ntions) at the band crossing is nonvanishing. At, and beyond\nI=14 \", the K=1 components of both proton and neutron\naligned intrinsic structures dominate, with the i13\/2 neutron\ncomponent larger than the h11\/2 proton. The total low-K sK\n=1,2d components dominate the yrast structure above cross-\ning. This total low-K component is itself dominated by the\ntwo K=1 RAL configurations discussed above, with contri-\nbutions from the K=2 states (not separately shown) giving a\nmuch smaller contribution than the K=1 structures. The PHF\nband crossing around I=22 \" is therefore suppressed in the\nband-mixing calculation. At higher spin, the \u201cground-state\u201d\nband appears to regain a large part of the amplitude. This is\npresumably due to an increase in the amplitude of configu-\nrations not in the space, but which look more like the fully\npaired K=0 ground state than other available configurations.\nThere is negligible contribution from the high-K configura-\ntions in the yrast structure.\nIt is noted that the gradual and simultaneous increase of\nthe proton and neutron RAL configurations in the yrast states\nis consistent with the previously presented calculations [3]\nusing a TRS (cranked shell-model) approach, lending cre-\ndence to both approaches.\nC. High-K structures in 170Dy\nSince both proton and neutron Fermi surfaces are sur-\nrounded by relatively high-V orbits one expects several\nhigh-K states with different intrinsic structures. Only a few\nlow-lying high-K structures, predicted to compete energeti-\ncally with the yrast states, are concentrated on here. It is\nfound that in PHF calculations the excitation energies of the\nhigh-K structures are often underestimated as pairing-type\nexcitations are not explicitly included. It is observed that\nmixing of various K=0+ configurations obtained by pairing-\ntype excitations (i.e., 2p-2h, 4p-4h) leads to a better estimate\nof the excitation energies. The intrinsic structures and the\nexcitation energies of possible low-lying, high-K states are\ngiven in Table IV. A neutron excitation (from \u22125\/2\u2212 to 7\/2\u2212)\nacross the Fermi surface gives the lowest K=6+ structure at\nan excitation of about 0.85 MeV. The other possible K=6+\nstructure has two unpaired protons in the Vp=5\/2\u2212 and 7\/2\u2212\norbits, respectively. This one was predicted to lie high in\nexcitation energy and have small (two percent) admixture\nwith the K=6+ neutron excitation. The rotational band based\non the two-neutron K=6+ state should be favored. The cal-\nculations predict four high-Ks\u00f810d states with different in-\ntrinsic structures which appear on and around the band cross-\ning sI.14d. Two K=12+ intrinsic structures are found at\napproximately the same excitation energy s,2.5 MeVd.\nFIG. 6. The yrast and yrare energy spectra obtained after band\nmixing are shown.\nFIG. 7. The K content of the even I yrast states is shown. The\ncompetition between different low-K structures is evident. The\nground-state sK=0d components almost vanish at band crossing.\nHowever the contribution of the other K=0 components obtained\nfrom pairing type excitations are nonzero. The neutron rotation\naligned (n-RAL) structure dominates over the proton aligned struc-\nture near crossing sI=14d.\nTABLE IV.

Band-mixing calcu-\nlations indicate that these structures mix very little with each\nother or with other low-K intrinsic structures, reflecting the\nrobustness of the K quantum number, at least amongst high-\nK states, in this axially symmetric nucleus. Observation of\nthese high-K isomeric states is awaited.\nWhile this study has concentrated on positive parity ex-\ncited states, negative parity states should also exist in 170Dy.\nSeveral single-particle orbits near the Fermi surface have op-\nposite parity. For example, the 7\/2+ neutron state is below\nthe Fermi surface while the 7\/2\u2212 orbit is just above. Hence\nthe excitation of a neutron between these two orbits gives\nrise to the lowest Kp=7\u2212 configuration, at about 1.3 MeV.\nSeveral such relatively high-K two-quasiparticle negative\nparity configurations are also possible. Importantly, a K=0\u2212\nstructure with a \u22127\/2+, 7\/2\u2212 character is found at about\n1.5 MeV and shows energy staggering. The lowest four-\nquasiparticle negative parity configuration has K=11 with a\ntwo-quasiproton s3\/2+,7\/2\u2212d and two-quasineutron\ns5\/2\u2212,7\/2\u2212d structure. A Kp=12\u2212 configuration, which differs\nfrom the above K=11\u2212 state by having a proton configuration\ns5\/2+,7\/2\u2212d, might also compete for yrast status. Some of the\npossible negative parity K structures are given in Table IV.\nIn summary, 19 different K-intrinsic configurations have\nbeen used in band-mixing calculations to find out the relative\nimportance of the different structures. The band-mixing re-\nsults of the yrast and yrare spectra are shown in Fig. 6. The\nyrast states are dominated by low-K components, as shown\nin Fig. 7. The yrare states represent rotational bands based on\nprominent high-K structures such as K=6+ and K=14+. The\nfirst excited states are based on a K=6+ intrinsic structure up\nto spin I=14. Above this, the states of the K=14+ band be-\ncome energetically favored over the K=6+ band.\nV. CONCLUSION\nFully self-consistent calculations have been performed for\nisotopes of dysprosium around the region of the midshell. It\nis found that different forces and parametrizations used in\nHF1BCS calculations for ground-state properties give quali-\ntatively similar results, with indicators of collectivity gener-\nally peaking for N,104. There is some spread in results,\nthough the results of the different Skyrme parametrizations\nare generally close to experiment, where data are available.\nThe ground states of the projected HF calculations are in\nbroad agreement with the no-core Skyrme mean-field calcu-\nlations and with other studies, supporting the approach that\nthe PHF ground state provides a good starting point for cal-\nculations of excited state spectra.\nThe PHF calculations followed by band mixing predict\nthe existence of several structures, including some high-K\nstates. The band mixing tends to push these states up in\nenergy, to more physically consistent values, compared to the\nPHF calculation alone. The Kp=6+ and Kp=14+ states both\nshow very little mixing with other K states, suggesting that K\nis a good quantum number for these states which may result\nin very long-lived K isomers, with large experimental hin-\ndrance for electromagnetic decay.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was funded by the UK EPSRC.
