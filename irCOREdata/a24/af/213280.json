Curiously, with \nthe exception of Enrique Tierno Galv\u00e1n, no significant figure of the movement within Spain or in \nthe exile has written of his experiences.  Without memoirs by Ram\u00f3n Rubial or Antonio Amat, \nby Rodolfo Llopis, Indalecio Prieto or Arsenio Jimeno, the silent resistance of the Socialists in \nthe interior and the full extent of the internecine struggles of the exiles are difficult to \nreconstruct.  The historiographical situation of the PSOE stands in sharp contrast to that of the \nCommunist Party.  The writings of both PCE propagandists and dissidents has virtually \nestablished a Communist monopoly of the history of the anti-Franco opposition.  This is a \nreflection of a reality which cannot be denied - the continuity and pre-eminence of the \nCommunist presence in the struggle against Franco.   \n \n However, this cannot be taken as justifying the Communist slur that during the Franco \nperiod, the Socialists were de_vacaciones.  For a number of reasons, several of them related to \nCommunist tactics both before and during the Civil War, the PSOE was to find itself \nirretrievably divided in the years following 1939.  This goes some way to explaining the lack of \nconcerted Socialist opposition against Franco.  The individual heroism of rank-and-file militants \nhas been forgotten in large part because of the lack of a united party ready or able to give it \npublicity, in the way that the Communist Party, was able to do for its role in the opposition.  In \nthis the PCE was amply assisted by the propaganda services of a dictatorship anxious, with an \neye on world opinion, to brand all opposition as Communist rather than democratic.  At the same \ntime, it has to be remembered that, given their history as a mass parliamentary party and a large \nlegal trade union organization, the PSOE and the UGT were hardly fitted for clandestine \nstruggle.  The unity and discipline imposed by rigid hierarchy, democratic centralism and the cell \nstructure together with the existence of help from Moscow gave advantages to the Communist \nopposition that had no equivalent in the Socialist movement. \n \n The periods of Socialist opposition to the dictatorship can be broadly defined as follows.  \nThe first period, 1939-1950, was characterized by defeat, greatconfusion and an already \ndiscernible tension between the interior and the exiles.  In Spain, small groups of militants \n#. \nstruggled to keep the PSOE alive.  Ram\u00f3n Rubial attempted to reorganize the party in prison; \nSocrates G\u00f3mez created the first executive in the interior.  The party was re-established in \nEurope by a follower of Largo Caballero from Aragon, Arsenio Jimeno, only after the liberation \nof Toulouse by the Allies in 1944.  The attention of Socialists in exile was absorbed by the world \nwar, by polemics arising from the Civil War and by optimistic speculation about the imminent \nfall of Franco.  For those in the interior, opposition had the more limited but also more realistic \naim of survival until assistance from outside might arrive.  In general, there was altogether less \ninterest inside Spain in sterile debate over issues like the Junta de Casado.  None the less, \nalthough Besteiro was dead and Largo Caballero in Mathausen, militants in the interior still \nlooked to the surviving famous leaders of the Republican period.  In exile, the energies of these \nhistoric leaders were devoted less to the real situation in Spain than to internal polemic and \nnegotiations with representatives of the Western powers in the hope of securing their \nintervention against General Franco.  Within Spain, sporadic guerrilla activities were carried out, \nespecially in Asturias, despite the fact that party policy was not committed to violent opposition.  \nIndeed, guerrilla action was dominated by the Communists.  The expected outside aid was never \nto come largely because of the attitude of the Allies and the PSOE leadership in exile must bear \nsome responsibility for not perceiving the reality of the international situation earlier than it did. \n \n The period 1951 to 1962 was marked both by a rigid determination of PSOE headquarters \nat the rue du Taur, Toulouse, to keep control of the interior and, at the same time, by a decline in \nthe real importance of the aging exiledleadership.  Small but ultimately important new groups of \nSocialistsformally unaffiliated to the PSOE began to emerge in Madrid and elsewhere in Spain in \nopposition to Toulouse.  At the same time, even the traditional Socialist strongholds of Asturias \nand Bilbao began to show signs of discontent with the dictatorial rule of Toulouse.  It was a \nperiod closed by the symbolic meeting of internal and exiled opposition at the Congress of \nMunich.  In the period 1962 to 1974, the PSOE was to suffer from possessing an exiled \nleadership whose narrow views and inability to adjust to the dramatic social changes consequent \non economic development were to be a serious obstacle to the rebuilding of the party.  \nAccordingly, these twelve years were marked by the increasing isolation of the Toulouse \nleadership in sharp contrast to the spontaneous emergence all over Spain of new, and often \nunconnected, groups of Socialists responsive to the changes in Spanish society.  A new labour-\n#. \norientated PSOE in Seville and Bilbao, an important group of Socialist intellectuals growing \naround the journal Cuadernos para el Di\u00e1logo, an influential group in Barcelona, the Moviment \nSocialista de Catalunya, smaller regional groups such as the Partit Socialista Valenci\u00e0 and the \nPartido Socialista Galego were all symptoms of change.  The PSOE itself was to be transformed \nwhen links were established between some of these groups and important and responsive \nsections of the exiled party, thereby creating the basis for the strong renovated party of the post-\n1974 period. \n \n During all three periods, there have been two major characteristics: the PSOE has \nconsistently taken part in efforts to unite the democratic opposition, but to exclude the \nCommunists - the Junta Espa\u00f1ola de Liberaci\u00f3n of 1944, the Uni\u00f3n de Fuerzas Democr\u00e1ticas of \n1961 and the Conferencia (later Coordinaci\u00f3n) Democr\u00e1tica of 1974.  This reflected an \nunderstandable under-current of anti-Communism, a hang-over from the Communist poaching of \nthe FJS in 1936 and of much of the UGT in the war years as well as of the ruthless activities of \nthe Communists in eliminating first Largo Caballero and then Indalecio Prieto from the war-time \ngovernment of the Republic.  Anti-Communism was also a reflection of the tendency under \nIndalecio Prieto, and to a certain extent under Rodolfo Llopis too, to look outside Spain for a \nsolution to the problem of the dictatorship.  In consequence, the PSOE tended to assume that \nanti-Communism was a pre-requisite of help from the USA, Britain or France.  The united fronts \nwere also a defensive response to the efforts of the Communists to by-pass the PSOE, and indeed \nCNT, leadership and to take over their rank-and-file from above. \n \n Substantial difficulties inevitably arose from the fact that the Socialist Party, like the \nCommunists, the anarchists and the Republicans, with its pre-existing regional and ideological \nsub-divisions, was divided between the exile and the interior.  Under the pressures of absence \nfrom Spain, splits occurred which often did not correspond to splits in the interior.  Broadly \nspeaking, however, the sector of the PSOE which remained loyal to the pro-Communist \ngovernment of Juan Negr\u00edn was led by Ram\u00f3n Lamoneda aided by Julio Alvarez del Vayo, while \nthe corresponding sector of the UGT was led by Ram\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez Pe\u00f1a, Jos\u00e9 Vega Rodriguez \nand Amaro del Rosal.  Expelled from the party in 1946, the pro-Negrinista sector briefly became \nUni\u00f3n Socialista Espa\u00f1ola and some of its leaders, like Amaro del Rosal, passed to the \n#. \nCommunist Party.1  The Negrinista faction of the PSOE was to fade away in part because of the \nsuccess of Indalecio Prieto in gaining control of the funds sent by Negr\u00edn from Republican Spain \nto Mexico in the yacht Vita.  Accordingly, the institutional continuity of the PSOE remained \nwith the sector reorganized by Prieto around the C\u00edrculo Pablo Iglesias in Mexico and by \nArsenio Jimeno Velilla in France.  Fully restructured at the I Congress in exile held in Toulouse \non 24 and 25 September 1944, when Enrique de Francisco became president and Rodolfo Llopis \nsecretary general, this was the section ultimately recognized on 7 February 1948 by the Socialist \nInternational.2  Inside Spain, clandestinity and constant police persecution, with imprisonment, \ntorture and execution the daily bread of the PSOE in the 1940s, made the elaboration of \nconsistent policies and the establishment of stable leadership virtually impossible.   \n \n It is remarkable that there was any opposition to Franco at all given the scale of deaths \nand casualties in the war, the subsequent exile and the intensity of the repression within Spain.3  \nIn Asturias, there was a concerted effort by the Civil Guard to smash the remnants of the \nSindicato Minero.  Regular arrests and torture culminated in May 1947 in the horrendous \nmassacre of Socialist miners in the Pozo Funeres.4  The PSOE lost six entire executive \ncommittees in the interior: in February 1945, the first led by Juan G\u00f3mez Egido and including \nVicente Valls, Antonio San Miguel, Francisco de Toro, S\u00f3crates G\u00f3mez, Mario Fern\u00e1ndez, Jos\u00e9 \nD\u00edaz M\u00e9ndez and Enrique Melero; in May1946 the second led by Eduardo Villegas and \nincluding Vicente Orche and Leopoldo Mejorada; in December 1948 the third under Miguel \nMart\u00ednez; in July 1949, the fourth under Antonio Trigo Mairal; in March 1952, the fifth under \nVizcaino; in February 1953, the sixth under Tomas Centeno Sierra who was brutally murdered in \nthe Direcci\u00f3n General de Seguridad.   The Socialists in the interior had a much more realistic and \nharsh view of the realities of Franco's Spain.5   \n \n They were bitter about the minimal economic aid which reached them from the exile.  In \nFrance, the exiles too faced considerable hardship.  However, there was considerable resentment \ninside Spain about the relative comfort allegedly enjoyed by those in Mexico.  In fact, the exiled \nrank-and-file in Mexico and other parts of Latin America could do little, neutralized by distance.  \nOthers nearer Spain often found themselves forced into the French Foreign Legion, German \nLabour Brigades or concentration camps.  The need to learn new languages and find work in \n#. \nhostile environments meant that they had little time to devote to Spain.   After all, the PSOE, \nunlike the PCE, had been quick to link the world war to the Spanish conflict.  In consequence, \nthe more active members of the party were as likely to be fighting in the French resistance or the \nBritish forces as thinking about Spain.6    \n \n The problems of exile aside, the greatest single factor contributing to the failure of the \nopposition was the persistence of the ideological divisions of the Civil War, widened by \ngeographical diffusion after 1939 and by embittered recriminations about the reasons for defeat.7  \nThe most bitter divisions were between the PSOE and the PCE, and between the pro- and anti-\nCommunist factions within the PSOE.  The Socialist movement had been divided before the war \nand, although the theoretical issues had changed somewhat, personal animosities remained to be \nexacerbated by recriminations over collaboration with the Communists.  Socialists both inside \nand outside Spain were divided on this issue which effectively condemned the party to \nimpotence.  Many in the PSOE were appalled by the Communists' behaviour at the beginning of \nthe world war.  The PCE denounced the war, which the Socialists saw as their war in defence of \ndemocracy, as an imperialist squabble and continued to blame the PSOE for defeat in the war.  \nAccordingly, the PCE project of national union was rejected with scorn.  A minority led by \nNegr\u00edn and Alvarez del Vayo favoured continued collaboration with the Communists while the \nmajority looked to the Allies for deliverance as a result of which they were denounced by the \nCommunists as 'capituladores y traidores'.8  The bitterness and sterility of Socialist division is \nbest illustrated by the sordid wranglings over the Vita and the use to be made of the funds taken \nout of Spain.  The Negrinistas had organized the Servicio de Emigraci\u00f3n de los Republicanos \nEspa\u00f1oles, while Prieto organized the Junta de Auxilio a los Refugiados Espa\u00f1oles and managed \nto seize the treasure of the Vita in Mexico.  Eventually these funds were used to support \nRepublican governments in exile.9 \n \n The anti-Communist sections of the PSOE were anxious to reunite the democratic forces.  \nProjects for unity were to suffer from two major weaknesses: their determined anti-Communism \nand their faith in the Allies.  The internal squabbles had already provoked the fatal error of not \nsetting up a government in exile in London.  On 25 November 1943, the Socialists and the \nvarious Republican groups (Izquierda Republicana, Uni\u00f3n Republicana, Esquerra Republicana \n#. \nde Catalunya and Acci\u00f3 Republicana de Catalunya) set up the Junta Espa\u00f1ola de Liberaci\u00f3n in \nMexico.  In August 1944, after the liberation of France, the same groups plus the CNT joined \ntogether in Toulouse and established a JEL in Europe.  There then followed a depressing polemic \nbetween the JEL and the Uni\u00f3n Nacional in the course of which it was claimed that several \nPSOE militants were murdered by Communist agents.10  The Socialist-dominated JEL saw its \ntask as to prepare the way for the entry of the Allied armies into Spain.  The Socialists and the \nRepublicans were to take a long time to perceive that their insistence on their democratic \ncredentials could never be as attractive to the West as Franco's unflinching authoritarianism.11 \n \n As an indication of the crucial difference in the ambience between the exile and the \ninterior, the problems of the JEL were briefly overcome inside Spain by the creation in October \n1944 of the Alianza Nacional de Fuerzas Democr\u00e1ticas.12  Linking the PSOE, the CNT-MLE and \nvarious Republican groups, the ANFD was the most significant initiative towards the unification \nof the anti-Franco opposition until 1975.  It represented a spontaneous effort to overcome the \ncontinuous bickering of the exiles and to take advantage of Franco's impending isolation.  \nNevertheless, the ANFD needed help from outside and so, in September 1945, when the \nRepublican government in exile under Jos\u00e9 Giral was constituted, the ANFD recognized it and \nbecame its instrument within Spain.  When the government failed, the ANFD failed with it.  \nHowever, at the time, the link with the government seemed to be the obvious step to take.  \nHaving fought Hitler and Mussolini in Spain, most Socialists and Republicans saw the world war \nas a natural continuation of their own struggle.  For that reason, over 20,000 Spaniards, many of \nthem members of the PSOE and the UGT, died during the Second World War fighting against \nthe Axis.  It was widely and understandably assumed within the Socialist movement that when \nthe Axis was defeated, the Allies would finish the task that had been begun in 1936 by turning \nagainst Franco.  That this did not happen is hardly surprising.  Nevertheless, the incompetence pf \nthe exiled leaders did not improve matters.  Giral's government was not formed until the Allies \nwere already war-weary and the Cold War was on the horizon.  If a responsible Republican \ngovernment (other than the isolated Negr\u00edn government which was not dissolved until 1944) had \nbeen formed in 1941 or 1942 when the Allies were desperate for any aid that they could get, it is \npossible that it might have been recognized and perhaps subsequently installed in Madrid.13 \n \n#. \n As it was, in 1945, the intention of the Giral government was to get recognition as a \nprelude to intervention and the re-establishment of the Second Republic.  To both the British and \nthe Americans, united in a growing anti-Communism and assuming the war-time Republican \ncause to be tainted by communism, this seemed mere sectarianism.14  Even leaving aside the lack \nof Allied sympathy and the generally hostile context, the various governments in exile did not \nhandle the situation well.  There was certainly a failure of will.15  One exiled government after \nanother stuck to the notion of reestablishing the Republic when it was clear that the only hope of \nsecuring Allied aid was to create a government of concentration which was also what many in \nthe interior wanted.16  This was quickly perceived by Prieto.  In March 1946, Britain, France and \nthe USA issued a tripartite note calling on the Spanish people to remove Franco by pacific means \nand to create government of transition which could call elections.  This clearly showed that \nAllied aid depended on the creation of a broad non-sectarian front including at least the \nmonarchists from among the Francoist forces.  Monarchists, in anticipation of Allied action, had \nalready been in touch with the ANFD.  The rank-and-file favoured a government of \nconcentration yet Giral rejected overtures which might have cleared the way for agreeement \namong all anti-Franco groups in Spain.   \n \n The exiled government's excessive optimism regarding the reestablishment of the \nRepublic was to destroy the opposition's best chance of overthrowing Franco.  When the failure \nof Giral's insistence on the exclusive legitimacy of the Republic became apparent, he was \nreplaced by the Socialist Rodolfo Llopis who tried to make agreement with the monarchists.  \nBecause of the inclusion of Uribe in the government and because they now felt stronger, with the \ndanger from the Allies passed, the followers of Don Juan de Borbon rejected the government's \noffer and stated that they would deal with the PSOE alone.  In July 1947, only five months after \nits formation, the Socialists left the government.  There was little reason to suppose that the \nMonarchists were really sincere.  They were probably just making sure that Franco knew that \ntheir loyalty could not just be taken for granted.  Don Juan never broke off relations with Franco \nand disavowed the agreements made.  When they finally made the Pacto de San Juan de Luz \nwith Indalecio Prieto, Trifon G\u00f3mez, Luis Jim\u00e9nez de Asua and Antonio P\u00e9rez for the PSOE on \n30 August 1948, Franco had already made an agreement with Don Juan on the yacht Azor.  The \nSocialists had been taken in by an elaborate exercise in duplicity, but they virtually had no \n#. \nchoice since collaboration was the pre-requisite of the Allied aid they so anxiously wanted.17  \nPrieto felt obliged to resign as both president of the PSOE and vice-president of the UGT, \ndemoralized and discredited by the negotiations on which he had staked so much.18  The scale of \ndiscontent within the party surfaced at the Congreso Extraordinario held on 31 March and 1 \nApril 1951 at which Trifon G\u00f3mez replaced Prieto as PSOE president.  Significantly, the main \nopposition to the executive was voiced by Arsenio Jimeno now leader of the Paris section of the \nparty.19 \n \n In the 1950s, the Socialist movement was divided against itelf by a mixture of misplaced \nmoral intransigence about alliances and petty jealousies within the leadership.  Moral \nintransigence represented the desperate attempt of an atrophying leadership to reassert itself over \na dying movement whose membership had reputedly sunk to only 3,000.  The increasingly \nnarrow attitude of the PSOE was one of the main reasons for lack of recruitment.  Moreover, the \nPSOE was becoming a party of old men for there were no middle cadres since the Socialist \nYouth Movement had passed to the PCE in 1936.  The backward-looking and egoistical \napproach of the Toulouse leadership was demonstrated as early as 1952 where a decision was \nmade at the V Congress held from 15 to 18 August to inform those in the interior that they could \nmake agreements with other groups only for the most specific short-term objectives.  The V \nCongress saw long and embittered debate on the question of alliances with Arsenio Jimeno again \ntaking up the cudgels on behalf of the interior against Prieto who defended the positions of the \nexecutive.20  Many Socialists in the interior were more aware of the realities of the situation.  \nAfter the death of Centeno, Toulouse had assumed full leadership of the party.  However, with \nthe emergence of student opposition in the mid-1950s and the revival of the workers movement \nespecially in Asturias, those in Spain began to argue that they should make policy since only \nthey could accurately calculate the risks and benefits involved.  The effective leadership of the \ninterior was taken up by the Basque Antonio Amat Maiz, sometimes known as 'El Ciclista' or \n'Guridi'.  A man of great courage and determination, he linked up many of the disparate groups in \nthe party and liaised with Toulouse, often making dangerous frontier crossings. \n \n Realizing that the PSOE was in no position to maintain exclusivist positions, the \nSocialists of the interior pushed for agreement with other groups.  In 1956, one of them, \n#. \nProfessor Enrique Tierno Galv\u00e1n leader of a growing number of Socialists in the universities \nproduced a document on the possible transition to another regime.  Amongst other possibilities, \nthe document suggested that if those in the interior did not cooperate with the liberal monarchists \nfor the implantation of a democratic monarchy, then Franco might well establish a reactionary \nmonarchy.  The reaction of the Toulouse leadership revealed just how out of touch they were.  \nThe document was denounced as treachery to Repubican legitimacy.  As if Tierno was the arbiter \nof Spain's future, the PSOE leadership convened a meeting with the CNT and the Republicans in \nParis in February 1957 to insist that the regime to follow Franco be neither monarchy nor \nrepublic until the issue was decided by a plebisicite.21  At one point, Tierno solicited the support \nof Gil Robles to sign 'con nosotros un documento dirigido a los socialistas del exterior para que \nsaliesen de su aton\u00eda y se uniesen con los socialistas que estabamos luchando dentro, para iniciar \nuna accion en comun, ponderada y no violenta'.  Llopis's reply, urging caution and setting out the \nlimits within which alliances could be made had a profound effect on Tierno: 'a mi me hizo \nreflexionar y fue quiza el momento en que empece a ver claro que poco o nada se podia esperar \nde fuera'.22   \n \n Thereafter, the interior Socialists continued to press for cooperation with other groups \nincluding the Communists.  Tierno in particular established important links with liberal \nmonarchists like Joaquin Satr\u00fastegui, with the social democrat followers of Dionisio Ridruejo \nand with his one-time colleague from the University of Salamanca, Joaqu\u00edn Ruiz Gim\u00e9nez.  \nFrom his office at Marqu\u00e9s de Cubas 6, in Madrid, aided by the support of the Le Monde \ncorrespondent, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Novais, Tierno was able to generate foreign interest in a revived \nSocialism of the interior.  He was far from alone.  At the VII Congress, held in Toulouse in \nAugust 1958, Amat called for the interior to have its own decision-making powers and was \neloquently defended by Luis Araquistain.  Llopis refused to go so far, granting the interior only \ntwo seats on the executive and declaring the need for a national anti-Franco committee excluding \nthe PCE.23  A parallel initiative to that of Amat, emanating from the Agrupaci\u00f3n Socialista \nUniversitaria under Francisco Bustelo, Luis G\u00f3mez Llorente and Vicente Girbau called for the \nASU to become an autonomous section of the PSOE.  Llopis also rejected their request.24 \n \n Toulouse continued in its quest for an anti-Communist unity and in June 1960 helped to \n#. \nfound the Uni\u00f3n de Fuerzas Democr\u00e1ticas, a doomed attempt to revive the old ANFD.  The UFD \nwas fundamentally an agreement between the PSOE, the Izquierda Dem\u00f3crata-Cristiano of \nManuel Gim\u00e9nez Fern\u00e1ndez, various Republican groups and some monarchists from the interior.  \nThe pact signed on 24 June 1960 was fundamentally weakened by its exclusion of the \nCommunist Party.  Despite its optimistic tone, with a preamble that declared the signatories to be \n'conscientes de que una accion comun de los distintos grupos puede precipitar la caida de la \ndictadura totalitaria que padece Espa\u00f1a',25 the irrelevance of such initiatives was underlined by \nthe continuing police attacks on the PSOE in the interior.   \n \n In November 1958, Antonio Amat was arrested as part of a great police round-up in \nMadrid, Bilbao, San Sebastian, Vitoria, Asturias and Andalucia, in which the PSOE lost its files, \nits propaganda networks and its funds.26  In August 1960, an equally devastating blow was struck \nby the police against the PSOE in northern Spain.  The distribution of pamphlets and \nnewspapers, the maintainance of morale, were immense tasks given the strength of the forces of \nrepression.  The Toulouse Socialists continued to think more in terms of tightly limited \nagreement with the Monarchists than with the Communists.  However, as American support for \nFranco increased, the Monarchists were fading as an opposition force.  The new generation of \nradical students formed in the university struggles of the mid-fifties thus looked not to the PSOE \nnor even to the PCE, but to the progressive Catholic and Castroista FLP (Frente de Liberaci\u00f3n \nPopular or 'Felipe') and FOC (Front Obrer de Catalunya).  Many individuals who took part in the \nFLP\/FOC were later to find their way into the revived PSOE (among others, Narcis Serra, \nPasqual Maragall, Joaqu\u00edn Leguina, Carlos Zayas, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Maravall).  In Catalonia the FOC \nwas to be crucial landmark in the construction of the Moviment Socialista de Catalunya.27 \n \n The growing importance of the internal opposition in relation to the exile was symbolized \nby the meeting in June 1962 of 80 interior and 38 exiled figures who met at the IV Congress of \nthe European Movement in Munich.  They agreed on a common declaration on the conditions \nthat the EEC should demand for Spanish entry: representative elected government, guarantee of \nbasic human rights, national minorities, syndical liberties, right to strike.  It is easy to exaggerate \nthe importance of the Munich meeting.  In fact, Munich was little more than the culmination of \nthe Socialist-Monarchist alliance whose greatest importance probably lay in the presence of \n#. \nright-wing figures including Gil Robles and Satr\u00fastegui.  However, in that sense, it was a symbol \nof reconciliation which pointed the way to a future democratic transition based on cooperation \nbetween the left and conservative figures who had abandoned the Francoist camp.28   \n \n Some Socialists from the interior were distressed by the extent to which Llopis seemed \nprepared to conciliate the Monarchists while blindly refusing any cooperation with the \nCommunists.  In consequence, subsequent efforts at renovation tended to be directed towards by-\npassing Toulouse and appealing directly to the Socialist International and the International \nConfederation of Free Trade Unions.  A more significant event in 1962 than what the Francoists \ncalled the 'contubernio de Munich' was the strike wave which began in Asturias.  It indicated a \nqualitative change in the economic circumstances of the regime and underlined the emergence of \na new proletariat to whose needs the Communists were to be more responsive than the PSOE. \n \n From 1962 on, the fascistic or extreme authoritarian forms of Francoism were \nincreasingly seen by the ruling classes to have served their purpose.  The economic surge \nconsequent on the capital accumulation of the early years of Francoism and on foreign \ninvestment coincided with the recuperation of the working class.  Thus there began a move \ntowards a gradual opening up of the system.  Along with a move to economic laissez faire, there \nwere indications of slightly more flexibility regarding strikes and censorship.  Interior leaders \nlike Amat and Ram\u00f3n Rubial in the Basque Country were backed by exilessuch as Arsenio \nJimeno and the Asturian Jos\u00e9 Barreiro both of whom who perceived the changing situation in \nSpain as a result of their contacts with emigrant workers and so pushed for change in Toulouse.   \n \n As far as Socialist intellectuals inside Spain were concerned, two things happened, both \nof which are difficult to separate from the influence of Joaqu\u00edn Ruiz Gim\u00e9nez.  Like Ruiz \nGim\u00e9nez himself, many Socialists in the interior acted as lawyers for working class leaders on \ntrial.  At the same time, they began to write in Ruiz Gim\u00e9nez's journal Cuadernos para el \nDi\u00e1logo.  This was to lay the basis for a future cooperation between the PSOE and the Christian \nDemocrats which was to be of crucial importance during the period 1975-1977.29  In the sort of \nSpain which the economic development was creating, the need for a democratic Socialist \nmovement was of tremendous urgency.  The PSOE did not play a great part, institutionally \n#. \nspeaking, in the 1960s.  Nonetheless, it was undergoing changes of great importance for the \nfuture.  Under the heavy hand of Llopis's exiled bureaucracy, the movement had been in steady \ndecline with the exception of Asturias, the Basque Country and the University Socialist group.  \nYet there were many, albeit separate efforts to revitalize the Socialist movement, some of which \nwould contribute directly to the renovation of 1972-1974 and others of which were eventually to \nbe incorporated into the reborn PSOE only after 1977.  In the early sixties, a one-time assistant \nof Largo Caballero, Jos\u00e9 Calvi\u00f1o Ozores, together with the Basque Josefina Arrillaga, tried, with \nthe aid of German trade unions, to rebuild a Socialist working class movement through the \nAlianza Sindical Obrera.  The exiled leaders of the UGT were furious.  Tierno Galv\u00e1n's group \nwas growing in importance.  Through Tierno's defence of the Communist leader Jos\u00e9 Sandoval \nMoris, who was put on trial by the regime in 1964, and through contacts made within the orbit of \nCuadernos para el Dialogo, the Marqu\u00e9s de Cubas group established warm relations with both \nthe PCE and the Workers Commissions.30  In Catalonia, a similar process of revival linked to \nboth the university and the labour movement, first ASO and later Comisiones Obreras, led by \nJoan Raventos, Ram\u00f3n Obiols, Jordi Estivill and Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda de la Riva culminated in the \n1967 Congress of the Moviment Socialista de Catalunya held at Montserrat.31  These various \nefforts from the interior to revitalizethe PSOE were skilfully deflected at the Toulouse \nCongresses by packed committees.  By the end of the decade, it was obvious that the exiles were \nout of touch with conditions in Spain and would have to be overthrown if the PSOE was to be \nrevived. \n \n With that in mind, on 21 January 1968, Professor Tierno Galv\u00e1n and about twenty five of \nhis followers including Raul Morodo, Jorge Enjuto, Pedro de Vega, Elias D\u00edaz and Donato Fuejo \nmet in a house in the Sierra de Guadarrama.  After long debate, they decided to form the \nSocialist Party of the Interior, with one vote against, that of Elias D\u00edaz.  Of little numerical \nimportance, the PSI nevertheless was a reflection of the growth of various currents which \ntogether and separately were to contribute to the rebirth of Spanish Socialism.  Tierno's idea was \n'dotar a las agrupaciones existentes de una determinada coherencia organica que posibilitase un \nfuncionamiento mas eficaz'.  Such 'eficacia' could only be in relation to Toulouse.  However, the \ntactical error of choosing to form a separate party, perhaps in the hope of being able to negotiate \nwith Llopis from a position of strength, led to Tierno Galv\u00e1n isolating himself from the \n#. \nultimately successful movement to renovate the party.32  The fact that the PSI had some support \nwithin the Comisiones Obreras was to drive a wedge between it and other groups who focused \ntheir efforts on the renovation of the PSOE. \n \n The Toulouse leadership was outraged by Tierno Galv\u00e1n's claim that the PSI was \nnecessary because of 'la inexistencia en el interior del pais de una organizaci\u00f3n con ideario \nsocialista que canalizase las aspiraciones de la clase trabajadora y de un amplio sector \nprofesional en sus deseos de democracia y defensa de sus intereses'.  However, together with the \ngrowing importance of the groups from Bilbao and Seville, the evidence of rebellion within \nSpain disturbed the exiles sufficiently to impel them to concede a superficial autonomy to the \ninterior militants at the XI Congress held in August 1970.  This was considered insufficient.  \nIndeed, so great was the discontent among the Socialists inside Spain, that a concerted anti-\nToulouse movement began to take shape through a series of important meetings held in Madrid \nbetween November 1970 and July 1971.  At these meetings, Antonio Amat, Ram\u00f3n Rubial, \nEnrique M\u00fagica, Luis Ya\u00f1ez, Miguel Peydro Caro and delegates from all over Spain effectively \ncreated a PSOE leadership independent of Toulouse.  The conflict came to a head in May 1972 \nwhen El Socialista published in the interior carried on its front page an article entitled 'Los \nenfoques de la praxis'.  Its conclusion was that 'los socialistas tienen pues una doble tarea que \ndesarrollar: la lucha contra el sistema capitalista que los opone y la lucha contra ciertas \nestructuras de su propia organizacion que amenazan con la esterilizacion de sus acciones'. \n \n Faced with this open challenge, Llopis was furious at what he denounced as a 'grave \ninjuria colectiva'.  The Toulouse executive demanded 'una rectificacion' under threat of declaring \nthe 'incompatibilidad' of the interior executive.  So deep was the split between the two executives \nthat a united convocatoria for the next congress due in August 1972 was impossible.  The Llopis \nleadership 'acordaron la no celebraci\u00f3n del Congreso en el mes de agosto teniendo en cuenta que \nen el ambiente de crisis, de ruptura y de escision existente celebrar el Congreso equivale a querer \nque haya ruptura y escision... Si a pesar de lo que acabamos de escribir, se celebrase el Congreso, \nconvocado por una parte del Partido, nos veriamos en el caso de declarar faccioso dicho \ncongreso.  Y advertimos a quienes asistan que, por el hecho de asistir a ese congreso, se colocan \nfuera de la disciplina del Partido y procederemos en consecuencia'.  Despite these threats, the \n#. \ninterior executive went ahead with the convocatoria of the Congress.33  At that point, older \nleaders like Arsenio Jimeno and Jos\u00e9 Barreiro, who had both resigned from the Toulouse \nexecutive in 1969, joined with the renovated executive from the interior to prepare the XII PSOE \nfor August 1972.  There were important interventions from Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez (Isidoro), Nicol\u00e1s \nRedondo (Juan), Enrique M\u00fagica (Goizalde) and Pablo Castellano (Herv\u00e1s).  To the chagrin of \nLlopis, delegates from Spain and from the emigrant workers overthrew his leadership and \ndecided that the PSOE executive should be led from the interior.34 \n \n This left both Tierno and Llopis isolated.  Llopis denounced the Congress as 'convocado \nde forma ilegal y antiestatutaria'.  When Llopis tried to fight back at a mini-congress in \nDecember 1972, Tierno and some of his followers were present.  Tierno spoke of 'este Congreso \nque de verdad es el unico Congreso autentico del PSOE y por tal lo reconozco'.  The Tiernistas \nhad backed the wrong horse.  A special commission of the Socialist International composed of \nrepresentatives of the British Labour Party, the French Socialist Party, the Chilean Radical Party \nand the Italian Socialist and Social Democrat Parties received representatives of both sections of \nthe PSOE in Paris on 12 and 13 January 1973.  After further meetings in London on 16 and 17 \nMarch and 28 August 1973, the International finally decided in favour of the PSOE-renovado on \n6 January 1974.35  Tierno Galv\u00e1n had rejected earlier overtures from the Bilbao-Seville group \nbecause he believed in the institutional legitimacy of the party apparatus in Toulouse.  As a result \nof Tierno Galv\u00e1n's tactical error, the question of a future unification of the PSOE with the \nPartido Socialista del Interior, by then converted into the Partido Socialista Popular, was not to \nbe resolved until 1978 and only then at the cost of some discontent on both sides.36 \n \n The conclusion of the XII Congress left the PSOE in good condition for the surge for \nunity after the death of Carrero Blanco.  Events in Italy, France, Portugal and Greece provided a \npropitious climate and persuaded many moderate Francoists that they should secure their future \nby dialogue.  The renovation begun in Toulouse in 1972 was consolidated at the XIII Congress \nheld on 11, 12 and 13 October 1974 at Suresnes.  Although the PSOE had only 3,500 militants \ninside and outside Spain, the switch of weight to the inside came at exactly the right moment.  \nFelipe Gonz\u00e1lez became primer secretario; Nicol\u00e1s Redondo, secretario de organizaci\u00f3n; \nEnrique M\u00fagica, secretario de coordinaci\u00f3n; Pablo Castellano, secretario internacional; Jos\u00e9 \n#. \nMaria Benegas, secretario de juventudes.  With Francoism crumbling, there was a need for the \nflexible democratic Socialist party now being created.  The fact that the renovated PSOE was \nmore in tune with Spanish society was reflected in the spectacular growth that the party was to \nexperience after 1976 and in its electoral success in 1977, 1979 and ultimately 1982.  After the \nparenthesis of Francoism, the PSOE was able to resume its rightful place in Spanish politics.  \nPSOE Under Franco Notes #. \n1.
