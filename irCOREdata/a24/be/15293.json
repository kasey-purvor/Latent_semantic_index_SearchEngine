In most cases, LMX is rated individually and set in relation to individually-rated \noutcomes. In this study, however, focus is placed on consensus in the perception of LMX \nwithin a team. In line with balance theory, it is argued here that consensus is an important \ninfluential factor in the development of followers\u2019 attitudes. Yet, in terms of group \nperformance, the relevance of shared work values need also be considered. The fact that a \nteam has high consensus in their perception of their leaders does not necessarily mean that its \nperformance is in line with company expectations. Consequently, in this study, it is proposed \nthat high work values would moderate the relationship between consensus and performance. \nThe hypotheses were tested using a sample of employees in German banks and insurances. \nResults indicate that there is some support for the proposed relationship between consensus in \ncontribution and job satisfaction as well as the relationship between consensus in contribution \nand commitment. In addition, moderating effects of work values emerged. This indicates that \nconsensus with respect to LMX is influential in organizations, and suggests that leaders \nshould strive towards having a similar relationship with all followers. \nConsensus in LMX 3 \nAre Consensus in LMX and Work Values Related to Organizational Outcomes? \nSome authors argue that a high degree of consensus in the perception of leadership serves as \nan important stimulus for team cohesion. Sanders and Schyns (in press), for example, found \nthis assumption confirmed in their study concerning perception of transformational \nleadership. A leadership concept that may be even more relevant in this context is Leader-\nMember Exchange, as it focuses on the relationship quality between a leader and each of his \/ \nher individual followers. It is proposed here that differences in the quality of relationship \nbetween a leader and individual members can lead to problems within a team\ni\n. Ideas \nconcerning how different relationships with a leader might affect other relationships within \nthe team could drawn from Heider\u2019s (1958) balance theory. This will be elaborated on in a \nfollowing section. Prior research suggests that consensus in a work group can indeed have a \nnegative impact on performance, for example when members have low work values (i.e., do \nnot regard work as important in their lives. Sanders, 2004). For this reason, it is expected that \nshared work values will have a moderating effect on the relationship between consensus in the \nperception of LMX and follower attitudes, as well as on consensus in the perception of LMX \nand performance.  \nLeader-Member Exchange and Consensus in Leader-Member Exchange \nLeadership research has focused on many different facets of leadership, one of these being the \ninteraction between leader and member. The merit of the LMX-approach (e.g., Graen & Uhl-\nBien, 1995) is that it takes into account the dyadic relationships between one leader and one \nfollower, as compared to the relationship between a leader and a complete group. Leader-\nMember Exchange (LMX) refers to the quality of this relationship between a leader and each \nof his \/ her members (e.g., Dansereau, Graen, & Haga, 1975; Dienesch & Liden, 1986; Graen \n& Uhl-Bien, 1995). Dienesch and Liden (1986) have developed an assessment of this \nrelationship quality based on a fundamental concept of mutuality and including three different \nConsensus in LMX 4 \ndimensions, namely: perceived contribution (to the mutual goals), loyalty (with respect to \npublic support), and affect (interpersonal attraction). Liden and Maslyn (1998) later added the \ndimension, \u201crespect\u201d, which refers to the follower\u2019s appreciation of his\/her leader\u2019s \nprofessional competences. Both leader and member contribute equally to the relationship \n(although the leader may be the one initiating the exchange, Graen, 2003). Consequently, \nwhen rating LMX, both leader and follower are asked to rate their relationship on the same \ndimension(s).  \nStudies on LMX have most often found positive relationships between followers\u2019 ratings \nof LMX and their work related attitudes (e.g., commitment, see meta-analysis by Gerstner & \nDay, 1997, and Schyns, Paul, Mohr, & Blank, 2005, for that relationship in a German work \ncontext) as well as follower\u2019s LMX ratings and performance (see meta-analysis by Gerstner & \nDay, 1997). \nAlthough early research on LMX suggests that there can indeed be differences in the \nquality of the relationships that individual members of a team have with their leader \n(Dansereau, Graen, & Haga, 1975), the question as to how these differences affect the way the \nteam works together has not yet been addressed. To formulate the question more concretely: \ndoes having different relationships with a leader have an impact on the members\u2019 attitudes \nand performance? Heider\u2019s (1958) balance theory suggests a possible answer to this question. \nHe argues that a triad of relationships has to be balanced in order for the members to feel \ncomfortable. In terms of LMX, this would mean that two followers with different \nrelationships to their leader are likely to get along badly (given that this difference in the \nrelationship to the leader does not change in the course of time in which they are working \ntogether). A precondition for a good relationship between two members then would be that \nthey agree that they both have the same quality of relationship with their leader (see Figure 1). \n--- Please insert Figure 1 about here --- \nConsensus in LMX 5 \nThis hypothesis is somewhat contradictory to the assumptions made in the context of \nLMX: Here, researchers maintain that a positive LMX relationship is always positively \nrelated to follower-related outcomes (e.g., their attitudes and performance). In contrast to this \nassumption, it is argued here that even low LMX can lead to positive members\u2019 attitudes, \nprovided that team members agree on the fact that they all have a low quality relationship \nwith their leader. The following section will outline how consensus in LMX is related to \nspecific attitudes. \nConsensus in the perception of LMX within a group and the correlated followers\u2019 attitudes \nIn terms of simple relationships, a prior study found that follower-rated LMX and followers\u2019 \nattitudes are only partly related in the dataset used here (Wolfram & Schyns, 2004; Schyns & \nWolfram, 2004). Whereas job satisfaction was related to most LMX dimensions, commitment \nand occupational self-efficacy were only related to the contribution dimension of LMX. In \nthis study, the individual LMX perception is seen to be less important for followers\u2019 attitudes \nthan is their consensus in the perception of LMX. It is expected that consensus impacts on \nfollowers\u2019 attitudes through the mechanisms outlined in the balance theory. These arguments \nare valid for job satisfaction and commitment. Employees who experience high consensus in \ntheir group are probably more satisfied with their work and feel more committed to their \norganization. In addition, consensus should be related to lower feelings of stress, as group \nmembers who have high consensus tend to help each other out in times of high workload (see \nSanders & Schyns, in press, for the relationship between consensus in the perception of \ntransformational leadership and solidarity behaviour).  \nIn terms of occupational self-efficacy, it is assumed that members working in teams that \nhave high consensus feel supported and get help from each other (Sanders & Schyns, in press; \nTyler & Blader, 2001). It has been shown that support in the sense of verbal persuasion \nenhances self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977) and, that model learning is enhanced by similarity \nConsensus in LMX 6 \nbetween model and observer (i.e., e.g., high consensus) which also leads to higher self-\nefficacy (Bandura, 1977). Consequently members of a group who agree on LMX should have \na high sense of self-efficacy with respect to their occupation. This allows us to assume that \nhigh consensus in LMX within a team is related to outcomes as rated by team members.  \nH 1: Consensus within the team (low standard deviation) on LMX is related to \nfollowers\u2019 attitudes (positively to job satisfaction, commitment, and occupational self-\nefficacy, and negatively to stress). \nConsensus in the perception of LMX, shared values, and performance  \nAlthough it is expected that consensus in the perception of leadership is related to followers\u2019 \nattitudes, a different picture should emerge for the relationship between consensus within the \ngroup and group performance. First, we could expect that consensus in the perception of \nleadership will be related to performance as rated by the leader. This assumption is based on \nthe idea that groups with high consensus cooperate better (see also the results obtained by \nSanders & Schyns, in press) and thus, reach a higher performance level. \nHowever, Sanders (2004) finds that certain forms of consensus (in this case, consensus in \nwork values) are related to absenteeism, more specifically, that high consensus in terms of \nnegative work values is related to higher short-term absenteeism. Consensus - in this case \nregarding work values that promote \u201cjoyriding\u201d - can lead to lower performance. \nConsequently work values are believed to be potential moderators of the relationship \nbetween consensus in LMX and group performance. High consensus in LMX in connection \nwith positive work values leads to high group performance, whereas high consensus in LMX \nin connection with negative work values leads to low performance.  \nH 2: Consensus within the team (low standard deviation) on LMX is positively related \nto group performance for teams high on work values and is negatively related to group \nperformance for teams low on work values. \nConsensus in LMX 7 \nMethod \nSample \nThe sample consisted of 234 followers (216 could be assigned to a leader) on low levels of \nhierarchy and their immediate supervisors. The sample was drawn from 22 banks and \ninsurance companies. One-hundred-sixty-eight female followers and 65 male followers took \npart in the study. The mean age was 35 years (SD = 9). Fifty-four supervisors participated in \nthis study. Twenty-nine of them were women, 25 men. The average age of the supervisors \nwas 38 years (SD = 7). On average, the supervisors and followers worked together for 2.5 \nyears (SD = 2.3). Per supervisor, we questioned between 1 and 10 followers (see also Schyns \n& Wolfram, 2004). The number of groups involved in this study was 54.  \nProcedure \nQuestionnaires were distributed among followers willing to participate in our study. \nFollowers filled in the questionnaires in group-settings during work time. They provided \nanswers to scales on LMX, job satisfaction, affective commitment, occupational self-efficacy, \nirritation, and work values. The questionnaires for the supervisors were distributed and then \ncollected after having been filled in. These questionnaires provided information concerning \nthe group\u2019s performance. In order to be able to match followers and supervisors, we assigned \neach person a number.  \nInstruments \nLeader-Member Exchange was assessed using a German translation of the LMX MDM \ninstrument (Paul & Schyns, 2004; original: Liden & Maslyn, 1998). The instrument consists \nof four dimensions, namely, affect, respect, loyalty, and contribution. Each dimension \nconsists of three items. The answer categories range from 1 = do not agree at all to 7 = agree \ncompletely. Sample items are \u201cI like my supervisor as a person\u201d (affect), \u201cI am impressed \nwith my supervisor\u2019s knowledge of his\/her job\u201d (respect), \u201cMy supervisor defends my work \nConsensus in LMX 8 \nwhen questioned by a superior, even without full knowledge of the issue in question\u201d \n(loyalty), and \u201cI do work for my superior that goes beyond what is specified in my job \ndescription\u201d (contribution). The internal consistencies (Cronbach\u2019s alphas) of LMX were \u03b1 = \n.92, \u03b1 = .89, \u03b1 = .81, and \u03b1 = .61, for professional respect, affect, loyalty, and perceived \ncontribution, respectively. Although the alpha for perceived contribution is relatively low, the \nlower alpha of this dimension compared to the other dimensions is in line with prior work \n(Liden & Maslyn, 1998; Maslyn & Uhl-Bien, 2001). \nJob satisfaction was assessed using a general job satisfaction instrument developed by Oegerli \n(1985). The instrument comprises of eight items. A sample item is \u201cI hope my work situation \nstays as good as it is at the moment.\u201d The scale ranges from 1 = almost never to 5 = almost \nalways. The reliability for eight items was \u03b1 = .77. \nCommitment was assessed with the affective component of commitment. We used the German \ntranslation of the Allen and Meyer (1990) instrument (Schmidt, Hollmann, & Sodenkamp, \n1998). The answer categories range from 1 = do not agree at all to 7 = agree completely. The \ninstrument consists of eight items with an internal consistency of \u03b1 = .73. A sample item is \u201cI \nwould be very happy to spend the rest of my career in this organization\u201d. \nOccupational self-efficacy. We asked followers to indicate the extent to which they feel \ncompetent enough to fulfil the requirements of their job. For this assessment, we used a \nshortened, 8-item version of the OCCSEFF by Schyns and von Collani (2002). A sample \nitems is \u201cNo matter what comes my way in my job, I\u2019m usually able to handle it.\u201d The answer \ncategories range from 1 = does not apply at all to 7 = applies completely. The internal \nconsistency for this scale was \u03b1 = .84. \nIrritation describes a particular psychological state lying between mental fatigue\/exhaustion \nand a state considered to be mentally ill (Mohr, M\u00fcller, & Rigotti, in press; Mohr, Rigotti, & \nM\u00fcller, in press). The answer categories range from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly \nConsensus in LMX 9 \nagree. An item example is \u201cI get irritable when others approach me\u201d. The five-item scale \nyielded a reliability of \u03b1 = .80. \nWork values were assessed using the subscale \u201cSubjective value of work\u201d of the AVEM \n(work related behaviour and experience patterns; Schaarschmidt & Fischer, 1996). The \ninstrument consists of eight items, with an answer scale from 1 = does not apply at all to 5 = \napplies completely. A sample item is \u201cI need my work like air to breathe\u201d. The internal \nconsistency was \u03b1 =.81 for four items.  \nGroup performance was assessed using leader ratings on the following two instruments. We \nassessed goal fulfilment with six items that indicate the degree of the fulfilment of goals set in \nadvance. A sample item is \u201cWe reach the goals set by the top management\u201d. The scale ranges \nfrom 1 = does no apply to 4 = applies completely. The internal consistency was \u03b1 =.82 for five \nitems. We also asked the supervisors to indicate to what percentage they and their group \nreached the goals set for them (Percentage of goal fulfilment). A sample item is \u201cTo what \npercentage have you reached the goals set by the company?\u201d The internal consistency of this \n4-item-instrument was \u03b1 =.79. \nAnalysis \nIn order to test the hypotheses, the standard deviation of LMX in groups in which followers \nrated one leader (degree of consensus) was calculated and correlated with the mean values of \ncommitment, occupational self-efficacy, job satisfaction, and irritation for that respective \ngroup. These standard deviations were then assigned to the respective leader and correlated to \nhis \/ her rating of the groups performance. For H2, the means of work values per group were \nalso calculated.  \nResults \nResults for consensus in followers\u2019 LMX-ratings and follower\u2019 attitudes \nConsensus in LMX 10 \nH1 (Consensus within the team (low standard deviation) is related to outcomes (commitment, \noccupational self-efficacy, job satisfaction, and irritation)) is only partly supported in our \nsample as only the correlation between the standard deviation in contribution and job \nsatisfaction reached significance (see Table 1). This correlation is negative, indicating that - as \nhypothesized - a lower standard deviation is related to higher job satisfaction. None of the \nother outcomes is significantly related to consensus in LMX, although some of the \ncorrelations are of substantial size (commitment). As some of the correlations were in the \nexpected direction, a composite measure of LMX was created and set into relation to the \noutcome variables. Again, due to the low N, no significant relationship was found, although \nwith the exception of the variable \u201cself-efficacy\u201d, all correlations are in the expected \ndirection. \nOne could argue that the correlation between contribution and job satisfaction is due, not \nso much to the standard deviation, but to an extreme high mean value implying a low standard \ndeviation. This point was addressed by calculating the means and the correlations between \nmeans and standard deviations for all LMX dimensions. The means are 5.71, 5.09, 5.21, and \n4.89, for respect, affect, loyalty, and contribution, respectively. The correlations are r = -.532 \n(p < .01), r = -.229 (n.s.), r = -.358 (p < .01), and r = -.488 (p < .01), for respect, affect, \nloyalty, and contribution, respectively. This does not suggest a ceiling effect for contribution. \n--- Please insert Table 1 here --- \nModerating effect of work values \nH2 (Consensus within the team (low standard deviation) on LMX is positively related to \nperformance for team high on work values and is negatively related to performance for teams \nlow on work values) was tested using a procedure recommended by Aiken and West (1991), \nwhere the variables involved are centred and terms suspected of interacting are multiplied. \nThe regression was performed using the standard deviation of LMX and the mean of work \nConsensus in LMX 11 \nvalues per team. As can be seen in Table 2, only the interactions between LMX-loyalty and \nwork values on goal fulfilment, and the interaction between LMX-respect and work values on \npercentage of goal fulfilment, become significant. Both are only significant on a 10%-level. \nHowever, as the beta-weights are substantial and the small sample size does not allow us to \nexpect higher levels of significance, these results are still noteworthy.  \n--- Please insert Table 2 here --- \nIn order to be able to describe the effect, the interactions were drawn according to the \nprocedure recommended by Aiken and West (1991). Figure 2 indicates that, for groups with \nhigh work values, the relationship between the standard deviation in loyalty and goal \nfulfilment is positive, indicating that the less consensus in loyalty the higher the performance \nfor groups with high work values. For groups with low work values the effect is the opposite, \nindicating that the more consensus in loyalty the higher the performance. This is contrary to \nexpectations. An analysis of the simple slopes using a programme provided by Johannes \nUlrich (http:\/\/www.staff.uni-marburg.de\/~ullrichj\/interactor_1.5.xls) reveals no significant \neffect (SE low = 0.06, t = 1.16, n.s.; SE high = 0.06; t = 0.49, n.s.). \n--- Please insert Figure 2 here --- \nFor consensus in LMX-respect and work values on percentage of goal fulfilment, a \ndifferent picture (see figure 3) emerges: There is almost no relationship between consensus in \nrespect and percentage of goal fulfilment for groups high in work values, and a positive \nrelationship between consensus in LMX and percentage of goal fulfilment for groups low in \nwork values, indicating that the less consensus, the higher the performance in these groups. \nThis is in line with expectations. An analysis of the simple slopes using a programme \nprovided by Johannes Ulrich (http:\/\/www.staff.uni-marburg.de\/~ullrichj\/interactor_1.5.xls) \nreveals significant effects (SE low = 0.20, t = 123.58, p < .001; SE high = 0.18; t = 126.58, p < \n.001). \nConsensus in LMX 12 \n--- Please insert Figure 3 here --- \nSummary and discussion \nIn this paper, it is assumed that followers\u2019 consensus in the rating of LMX is positively \nrelated to positive followers\u2019 attitudes and negatively related to negative followers\u2019 stress. \nThis hypothesis was only partly supported. Only the correlation between consensus in \ncontribution and job satisfaction becomes significant. Others (e.g., to commitment) are \nsubstantial but do not become significant due to small sample size. In this paper, it was argued \non the basis of Heider\u2019s (1958) balance theory that a similar perception of the leader leads to \npositive outcomes. However, LMX research to date had found that the Leader-Member \nrelationship quality has to be high to yield positive results (Gerstner & Day, 1997). It cannot \nbe ruled out that the same is true for groups, that is, that there has to be consensus that the \nrelationship qualities of each member with the leader are high. Hogg, Martin, and Weeden \n(2003), whose work is based on social identity theory (e.g., Tajfel, 1982), could show that a \npersonalized leadership style such as LMX is relevant in groups with high and low \nmembership salience. For our study, this could mean that a high quality relationship (high \nLMX) has an effect on the group members\u2019 attitudes, and also an effect on groups that have \neither high or low consensus in LMX.  \nWith respect to the impact of consensus in work values, two of the interactions of work \nvalues and consensus in LMX become significant. For consensus in loyalty and work values \non goal fulfilment, results indicate that the relationship is negative for groups high in work \nvalues, which is to say that consensus is negatively related to performance in these groups, \nwhereas it is positively related to performance in low work value groups. This could argue for \na compensation effect. If the work values are low, a consensus in LMX can still lead to high \nperformance. The result for the high work value group is less easy to explain: Why would \nconsensus in loyalty lead to lower performance when the work values are high? In a way, this \nConsensus in LMX 13 \nis a compensation effect as well, as low consensus is still related to high performance when \nwork values are high. Alternatively, loyalty refers to the extent to which a leaders is willing to \ndefend his \/ her followers. As consensus is defined independent of the actual amount of \nloyalty a leader shows, the members in this case probably agree that the leader does not show \nloyalty, which may not be in line with their own work values and, thus, their performance \nsuffers. A post-hoc analysis indeed reveals that the group with high work values is a bit lower \nin the mean loyalty they perceive in their leader than the group with low consensus although \nnot significantly so. Another explanation is that these people have high achievement \nmotivation and could not, due to the bad economic situation in Germany at that time, live up \nto the expectation, whereas groups low in work values could do so as their ambitions may be \nlower in the first place. \nFor respect, no relationship between consensus and percentage of goal fulfilment for high \nwork value groups was found. It seems, therefore, that their performance is independent of the \nconsensus on respect within their groups. This result is in line with expectations in so far as \ngroups high in work values are expected to perform well, independent of the context. For \ngroups low in work values a negative relationship between consensus and performance was \nfound: The lower the consensus the higher the performance. Thus, consensus may compensate \nfor low work values. Here, again, the groups are probably not positive about their leader\u2019s \ncompetence (as respect refers to the estimation of the leader\u2019s competence), and, therefore, do \nnot put effort in their task. \nLimitations and future research \nCertain limitations apply to this research. Although we were able to approach more than two-\nhundred participants for our study, the approach taken here allows us only to analyse the data \non a group level, limiting the N for the analyses to around fifty. Consequently, although some \nabsolute values (rs and betas) were reasonably high, they did not reach significance. Future \nConsensus in LMX 14 \nresearch could either try to examine a bigger sample or assess consensus in a different \nmanner. A future approach could be to ask individuals to indicate their personal impression of \ngroup consensus. This may also have the advantage that perceived group consensus may \naffect individual outcomes to a bigger extend than the actual consensus.  \nIn this study, cooperation was not assessed. Therefore, it remains unclear as to whether the \ngroup members actually act on their consensus in the sense that they not only agree on certain \ntopics (in this case their relationship to their leader) but also behave accordingly.  \nConclusion \nConsensus in work groups is in itself an interesting topic as research has shown that it can \nhave positive and negative outcomes with respect to organizational goals. This study has \ncontributed to our knowledge about the effect of consensus, especially with respect to \nconsensus in the perception of the relationship to the leader. Although only few results \nbecame significant, there were some interesting findings, such as the interaction effects of \nconsensus and work values. It seems that both work in a compensatory manner.  \nConsensus in LMX 15 \nReferences \nAiken, L. S., & West, S. G. (1991). Multiple Regression: Testing and interpreting \ninteractions.
