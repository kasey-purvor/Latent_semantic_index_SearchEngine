These enzymes may be subdivided into those that metabolise \npurely endogenous chemicals, and those that are involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Of \nthe latter group it can be argued that CYP3A sub-family members rank as the most \nimportant; their high expression in the liver and wide substrate specificity mean that \nthey are clinically important in the metabolism of many therapeutic drugs, and alteration \nin their activity is central to many clinically-relevant drug-drug interactions. \nIn this review I will examine the human CYP3A enzymes, discussing their genome \nstructure, common allelic variants and, in greatest detail, their transcriptional regulation. \nThrough examination of these characteristics we will see both striking similarities and \ndifferences between the four human CYP3A enzymes, which may have important \nimpacts on inter-individual response to chemical exposure. Finally, the role of nuclear \nreceptors in regulating CYP3A gene expression, and indeed that of many other proteins \ninvolved in drug metabolism, will be examined: Such an examination will show the \nneed to utilize a systems biology approach to understand fully how the human body \nresponds to chemical exposure.  \n \n 3\nGeneral Introduction \nMembers of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) super-family of enzymes form an essential \npart of the body\u2019s ability to carry out both anabolic and catabolic metabolism. Indeed, \nthe very fact that members of this super-family have been identified in all studied \norganisms, from archaebacteria to humans, underlines their importance for organism \nsurvival [1]. Although all organisms possess CYP enzymes the number of CYP genes \nper organism is not constant, with more ancient organisms having fewer CYP genes. \nIndeed, it is the development of organisms with a gastro-intestinal tract that triggered a \nmarked in CYP genes per organism, with increased chemical intake through the diet \nbecoming a significant driver in the need to evolve new proteins capable of \nmetabolising these chemicals [2]. Of the CYP isoforms present within an individual \norganism it is therefore possible to further subdivide them into those that mediate \nmetabolism of endogenous chemicals and those that undertake xenobiotic metabolism, \nwith members of this latter group being the focus of this review. Of the 57 CYP genes \npresent in humans, is it really only member of families CYP1, CYP2 and CYP3 that are \ninvolved in xenobiotic metabolism. Of these, the CYP3A sub-family represents perhaps \nthe most significant group due to two facts: First, CYP3A enzymes are the most \nabundant CYPs in human liver, comprising between 30-50 % of total CYP content, and \nhence represent the bulk of the CYP enzymes that a chemical is likely to be exposed to \n[3]. Second, a large active site results in substrate promiscuity, meaning that up 60 % of \ntherapeutics in use today that are subject to metabolism are substrates for CYP3A sub-\nfamily members [4]. Taken together it can be seen that for the majority of xenobiotics \nCYP3A plays some role in their metabolism in humans. \n \nRelevance of studying CYP3A gene expression \n 4\nAn amazing ability of the human body is its ability to handle xenobiotics, utilizing \nthose that are beneficial to the body and removing rapidly those that might prove \nharmful. Indeed without such ability it is questionable whether Homo sapiens would \nhave ever arisen, for the requirement of higher organisms to interact, and react, to their \nenvironment is an absolute. This metabolic capacity is not only large but flexible, with \nprotein levels being increased in response to chemical exposure, resulting in the most \nefficient response to any xenobiotic. It is thus logical that to understand how the body \nresponds to xenobiotics we must first understand how these chemicals interact with the \nmetabolic network within the body. \nAn important extension of this need to be able to understand the molecular \nmechanisms of body-xenobiotic interactions is the requirement to be able to predict \nsuch events, and in particular those that may result in toxicity. Prediction of toxicity as a \nresult of the bio-activation of chemicals that occurs during metabolism is relatively \nstraightforward, and can be achieved to a good degree of accuracy using in silico \nprograms such as DERECK, TOPCAT or HazardExpert [5-7]. However and area of \nincreasing concern are toxic reactions caused due to interactions between co-\nadministered chemicals. Combination chemotherapy is used increasingly in medial \nhealthcare today, for the treatment of complex, life-threatening diseases such as HIV [8] \nor cancer [9], or in individuals with multiple, often long-term conditions, such as the \nelderly [10, 11] or during long-term prophylaxis of psychiatric disorders [12, 13]. Co-\nadministration of multiple drugs that are metabolised by the same enzyme system(s) to a \nsingle individual may potentially result in altered pharmacokinetics for some, none, or \nall of the co-administered compounds. If these effects occur to such an extent that \nclinical efficacy is lost, or toxicity produced, then such interactions are usually rapidly \nreported in the literature. Indeed, it has been estimated that adverse drug reactions are \n 5\nthe fourth largest killer in the Western World, and as such are a major health concern. \nSuch drug-drug interactions may occur through two major mechanistic routes, inhibition \nof enzyme action or activation of gene transcription. Inhibition is a widely accepted \nproblem, and much research has been undertaken in this area; the interested reader is \ndirected to these recent reviews [14-16]. The focus of this review will be on the increase \nin protein number caused by activation of gene transcription. It should be noted that \nincreased protein expression can also occur by chemical-mediated increases in transcript \n(e.g. clotrimazole [17] or protein (e.g. triacetyloleandomycin [18]) stability, but these \nare more the exception rather than the rule and will not be discussed herein. \nThe presence of a wide-substrate binding profile for an enzyme is a direct correlate \nwith predilection for drug-drug interactions and hence it is not surprising that CYP3A \nenzymes are subject to large number of such interactions. Table 1 presents a selection of \nestablished drug-drug interactions involving activation of CYP3A gene transcription. \nAn interesting point to note is that several of these are not \u2018drug\u2019-\u2018drug\u2019 interactions in \nthe true sense as the inducing agent is not a therapeutic agent; this underlines the \nimportance in understanding the molecular mechanisms of drug-drug interactions as \nindividuals may be exposed to many of the combinations without their physicians, or \nindeed their own, knowledge.  \n \n[TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE] \n \nCYP3A family members \nDespite its high biological significance with regards to xenobiotic metabolism, the \nCYP3A sub-family is relatively compact, comprising only four members in humans: \nCYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7 and CYP3A43 [19]. Following the basic definition of \n 6\nsub-family membership, the sequences for these proteins demonstrate at least 70 % \nidentity, with the exact matches being given in Table 2. \n \n[TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE] \n \nA particular feature of CYP-biology in general, and one that is particularly relevant \nto the CYP3A sub-family in particular is that large inter-individual variations in enzyme \nexpression have been reported [20-23]. Such variation is probably due to a combination \nof chemical-mediated induction\/inhibition of CYP activity (e.g. environment) and the \npresence of activity\/expression polymorphisms (e.g. genetic). The exact input of these \ntwo factors is a matter of debate, with estimates for the genetic contribution towards the \nvariation in CYP3A expression ranging from 60 % to 90 % [24].  A large compendium \nof CYP alleles is held by the official allele nomenclature committee \n(http:\/\/www.imm.ki.se\/CYPalleles\/), which currently lists 40 variants for CYP3A4, 24 \nfor CYP3A5, 7 for CY3A7 and 5 for CYP3A43. However a survey of the literature \nreveals the majority of these variants are either of little biological significance or low \nfrequency, and hence would not act as a major contributor to the observed inter-\nindividual variability in CYP3A activity [22, 25-29]: Selected variants with the largest \npotential biological impact are discussed in detail within the relevant sections below. \nThis lack of \u2018major\u2019 allelic variants to account for inter-individual variation, as for \nexample seen in CYP2D6 [26], suggests that inter-individual variation in CYP3A \nactivity is the result of one of three scenarios. First that the large number of \u2018minor\u2019 \nvariants combine together to produce the total variation in CYP3A activity that is \nobserved in the population. Second that environmental impact is the major player in \ndetermining CYP3A activity, and individual exposure to CYP3A inhibitors\/inducers \n 7\ndetermines CYP3A activity. Third, that genetic variation exists outside the CYP3A \ngenes, which impacts upon their expression. Of these possibilities, the first seems \nunlikely as the frequency of these variants in combination still appears too low to \nexplain all the observed variation in activity, as will be discussed below. However, the \nsecond and third possibilities are equally valid, and I suspect that the true answer is a \ncombination of both; the exact ratio of these inputs being as yet undetermined. \nWhereas inter individual variation in CYP3A activity is generally accepted, \ninvestigations for potential sex differences in expression are much more equivocal. In \ntwo separate studies erythromycin N-demethlyation has been reported to be greater in \nfemales, by 24 % [30] and 36 % [31], suggesting that a slight sex difference may exist. \nHowever, the difficulty in removing confounding factors from such studies means that \nsuch data must be treated with caution. \nWhen studying the CYP3A sub-family it is perhaps fair to say that equal importance \nshould not be given to all family members. Although all individuals tested to date \nappear to express CYP3A activity [19], the different isoforms input differently into this \nactivity: Each isoform will be discussed below in more detail, along with the major \npolymorphisms associated with the corresponding gene.  \nCYP3A4 \nCYP3A4 transcripts are undetectable in foetal liver [32], but rapidly rise after birth \nwhereupon CYP3A4 becomes the predominant liver CYP in the majority of adult livers \n[4, 33]: Due to this fact CYP3A4 is the best studied of the CYP3A sub-family members \nin humans.  \nThe wide substrate binding profile and catalytic activity of CYP3A4 results in a \nnumber of possible biotransformation reactions, encompassing C- and N-oxidations, N- \nand O-dealkylations, nitro reductions and dehydration reactions [19]. Recent \n 8\ncrystallographic study of CYP3A4 [34], combined with homology modelling [35-37] \nand mutagenesis of recombinant CYP3A4 [38-43] has identified key residues within the \nactive site that are responsible for reaction catalysis. \nA number of CYP3A4 allelic variants have so far been identified that may \ncontribute to the known inter-individual expression of CYP3A [27, 28, 44-47]. Of these, \nsome variants have been shown to result in the total ablation of holoenzyme production \n(e.g. R130Q and P146L [45]), whereas others impact directly on enzyme activity (e.g. \nL373F [45]and  F189S [46]). However, the relatively low frequency of these alleles \nmeans that the overall input of individual variants towards the observed variation in \nCYP3A activity is questionable [48]. For example, one of the more widely expressed \nvariants is F189S, yet this variant only has an allelic frequency of 2 % in Caucasians \n[46]. Recently, Eiselt and colleagues identified eight CYP3A4 variants, of which only \nfour have a substantial effect of CYP3A4 activity. The combined heterozygote \nfrequency of these eight variants was only 7.5 % in the European population [45], \nunderlying the disparity between the impact of the identified CYP3A4 variants on \nCYP3A activity and the much larger total variation in CYP3A activity observed in the \ngeneral population. \nCYP3A5 \nIn parallel with CYP3A4, significant expression of CYP3A5 is not associated with \nthe developing foetus, with low level expression being detected in less than 10 % of \nhuman foetal livers [49]. However, in contrast to CYP3A4, which is expressed in all \nadult human livers, CYP3A5 expression appears to be limited to approximately one-\nquarter of individuals [49]: In these individuals, however, the level of CYP3A5 is often \nequal to, or exceeds, that of CYP3A4, making it a significant player in determining \noverall CYP3A activity for these individuals [50]. Given the known differences in \n 9\nmetabolic capacity between CYP3A isoforms [51-55], such variation in expression may \nhave a potentially large impact on the wide inter-individual variation in CYP3A activity \nobserved in the liver [4]. It is also worthy of note that CYP3A5 is expressed in several \norgans in which CYP3A4 is not highly expressed, for example skeletal muscle [56], and \nhence differences in metabolic profile between liver and these organs may exist.   \nThe very fact that CYP3A5 is expressed in only approximately one-quarter of adult \nlivers suggests the presence of allelic variants for this gene. As stated earlier, the \nmajority of identified SNPs for CYP3A5 are of little population significance, due either \nto their low frequency or small biological impact [29]. However, Kuehl and colleagues \nidentified a family of allelic variants for which both a significant population and \nbiological effect exists. They identified three splice acceptor site polymorphisms that \nresulted in the potential inclusion of mini-exons between exons 3-4, 4-5 and 5-6 \n(designated exons 3B, 4B and 5B) [57]. Inclusion of these mini-exons introduces a stop \ncodon in the CYP3A5 transcript, thus producing a truncated, non-functional CYP3A5 \nprotein [57]. A solid hypothesis would therefore be that the variants including these \nmini-exons (CYP3A5*3 SV1, 2 and 3) are actually held by the majority of individuals \nand result in low\/negligible CYP3A5 expression, with the minority expressing the wild \ntype, fully functional, variant.  Subsequent screening of diverse ethnic groups has \nsuggested that this allelic variant (CYP3A5*3) may represent a good marker for overall \nCYP3A activity, and although it does not account for all non-expression of CYP3A5 \nmay be of some use in prospective screening [58-60]. \nCYP3A7 \nWhereas CYP3A4\/5 are the predominant CYP3A isoforms in adult liver, in the \ndeveloping foetus CYP3A7 is the predominant CYP3A expressed, and in an inverse \nrelationship to CYP3A4\/5, levels of CYP3A7 decrease rapidly at birth [32, 33, 61, 62]. \n 10\nApproximately one-half of adults have detectable levels of CYP3A7 within the liver, \nalthough in general this is at lower levels to both CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 and probably \nhas a negligible input into CYP3A-mediated metabolism [32]. However, approximately \n10 % of adults do have significant levels of CYP3A7; this increased expression being \nassociated with the CYP3A7*1c allele, which affects the PXR response element in the \nCYP3A7 promoter. In these individuals CYP3A7 may contribute up to one third of the \nCYP3A content of the adult liver [63], and thus have a significant input into CYP3A-\nmediated metabolism. Liver is not the only organ that shows significant adult \nexpression of CYP3A7, with an increase in endometrium and placental expression of \nCYP3A7 being observed in pregnant women [64] and during the secretory phase of the \nmenstrual cycle [32]. It has been proposed that the increased CYP3A7 expression \nduring pregnancy may be foeto-protective, reducing 6\u03b2- and 16\u03b1-hydroxylation of \nsteroid precursors, which if unchecked could result in dysregulation of steroid levels in \nthe developing foetus [65]. \nCYP3A43 \nIn 2001 a new member of the human CYP3A sub-family was cloned, termed \nCYP3A43 [66-68]. CYP3A43 appears to be expressed in a similar range of tissues to \nother members of the CYP3A subfamily (e.g. liver, kidney, pancreas, testes and \nprostate) and has been identified in both adult and foetal samples. However, the \nexpression of this isoform appears to be at very low levels in comparison to \nCYP3A4\/5\/7, with adult hepatic expression being only approximately 0.1 % and 2 % of \nmean CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 transcript levels respectively [67]. In addition, studies on \nthe metabolic capability of CYP3A43 demonstrate very low 6\u03b2-hydroxylation activity \ntowards testosterone, suggesting a weakly metabolically active isoform. This poor \nmetabolic activity has been attributed to six amino acid substitutions in the active site of \n 11\nthe enzyme compared to CYP3A4 [66]. The total identity of CYP3A43 to other \nmembers of the CYP3A sub-family is low, on average 73 % (Table 1), just qualifying it \nas a member of this sub-family.  This combination of low identity, low level expression \nand low activity means that he biological significance of CYP3A43 with regards to total \nhuman CYP3A activity is probably negligible. \n \nCYP3A gene structure \nExamination of the genomes of divergent organisms such as plants and fungi has \nrevealed that many of the CYP genes are present in clusters on chromosomes [69, 70]. \nSuch clustering presents strong evidence that they originated via gene duplication \nevents [70], either as discrete events or as part of whole genome duplications [71, 72]. \nThe CYP3A sub-family of genes is no exception of this rule, and exist as a cluster on \nhuman chromosome 7q21-q22.1 [73, 74]. The CYP3A4, CYP3A7 and CYP3A5 genes lie \nin a head-to-tail configuration in the order listed, with CYP3A43 located in the reverse \norientation, 44.8 Kb away from CYP3A4. Two non-processed pseudogenes exist \n(CYP3A5P1 and CYP3A5P2) in the regions between CYP3A5 \u2013 CYP3A7 and \nCYP3A4-CYP3A7 respectively, also in head-to-tail orientation [73]. Finta and \nZaphiropoulos reported a CYP3A7 derived transcript that contained exons from the \nCYP3A5P1 pseudogene, suggesting evolution within the CYP3A gene cluster may \noccur through the capture of downstream exons in addition to complete gene \nduplication events [73].  \nIn general, the basic structure of the CYP3A genes is the same for each member, \ncomprising of 13 exons with a processed transcript size of approximately 2 Kb (Table \n3).  \n \n 12\n[TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE] \n \nAs can be seen from table 3, each human CYP3A gene has relatively short 5\u2019 \nuntranslated regions, with a mean 5\u2019 UTR length of 101nt, considerably below the \naverage 5\u2019 UTR length for human transcripts of 150nt [75]. Interestingly, the 3\u2019 UTR \nlengths for human CYP3A genes is quite variable, ranging from 111nt in CYP3A5 to \n1152nt in CYP3A4, compared to the human mean 3\u2019 UTR length of approximately \n500nt [75]. The molecular rationale behind these differences in 3\u2019 UTR length is \ncurrently unknown, but as UTRs commonly contain regulatory regions that effect \ntranscript stability or translation efficiency it is possible that these differences are \nimportant in the functionality of the CYP3A transcripts and their ability to produce \nCYP3A protein. In silico analysis of the 3\u2019 UTR regions of the human CYP3A genes \nusing the miRanda algorithm (http:\/\/microrna.sanger.ac.uk\/index.shtml) reveals a \nnumber of putative micro-RNA binding sites that may underlie the molecular \nfunctionality of CYP3A 3\u2019 UTRs [76, 77]. It should be noted that such prediction does \nnot denote function, with no empirical evidence for any of these sites having yet been \ndemonstrated. However, the conservation of sites across evolutionary time is a good \npredictor of biological significance, and several of these sites are conserved between \nhumans and chimpanzee\u2019s (5.5M years divergence [72]), with some even conserved \nbetween humans and mice (40M years divergence [72]); the total number of predicted \nmicroRNA sites, with details on those conserved between species are presented in table \n4. The area of microRNA regulation of gene expression is a rapidly expanding area, and \nas shown above has exciting potential implications for the expression of CYP genes. \n \n[TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE] \n 13\n \nCommon regulatory elements for CYP3A sub-family members \nA large number of studies have now been undertaken to examine the molecular \nmechanisms underlying xenobiotic-mediated activation of CYP3A gene expression. \nWhereas the majority of this work has focussed on CYP3A4 as it encodes the major \nCYP3A protein in the majority of adult human livers, sufficient work has been \nundertaken on the regulatory elements of CYP3A5 and CYP3A7 that a comparison is \nworthwhile; indeed, by studying common elements we may learn more about the \ngeneral mechanism through which the body responds to chemical exposure. Little or no \nwork has been undertaken on the CYP3A43 regulatory regions and, as stated \npreviously, the biological significance of this isoform is limited: CYP3A43 will \ntherefore not be examined further in this section. \nCYP3A regulatory region overview and general transcription factors binding \nThe proximal promoter regions of CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and CYP3A7 share a high \ndegree of identity. Over the first 1Kb upstream from the transcription start site CYP3A4 \nand CYP3A7 exhibit a remarkable degree of identity, 91 % [78]. Indeed, this region of \nidentity extends beyond the proximal promoter to the upstream xenobiotic-response \nenhancer module (XREM; -7836 bp to -7607 bp), with identify over this region being \n90 % [79, 80]: After this point the sequences diverge sharply, with identity dropping to \napproximately 25 %. Such a high degree of similarity is highly suggestive that modes of \nregulation for these two genes are shared, as indeed there is much evidence to suggest \nthis is the case [79, 81].  \nBy comparison the first 1.5 Kb of the CYP3A5 proximal promoter shares only 60 % \nand 59 % identity with the corresponding CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 regulatory regions \n[68, 82]. The region first identified by Jounaidi and colleagues as the CYP3A5 proximal \n 14\npromoter is in fact the promoter of the unprocessed pseudogene CYP3A5P1 [68, 83]; \nhowever as these two regions share over 90 % identity the conclusions drawn by \nJounaidi and colleagues are still valid for the correctly identified CYP3A5 proximal \npromoter. Closer examination of the CYP3A5 proximal promoter identifies a breakpoint \nat approximately 700 bp upstream of the transcription start site past which identity with \nCYP3A4 and CYP3A7 promoter sequences drops rapidly [68]. This is suggestive that a \ngene modification event has occurred at some point in evolution, such as a large \ndeletion\/insertion or gene conversion with a non-CYP3A gene, resulting in this \ndramatic cut-off in sequence identity. \nA second difference between CYP3A5 and CYP3A4\/7 is that whereas both \nCYP3A4 and CYP3A7 proximal promoters contain a classical TATAA-box and basic \ntranscription element (BTE) [78, 80], the CYP3A5 proximal promoter has a modified \nTATAA-box (CATAA) and BTE [83], which is often associated with lower \nselectivity\/multiple positions for the transcription start site. Work by Iwano \ndemonstrated that both Sp1 and Sp3 were able to bind to the BTE (-66 bp to -45 bp) of \nCYP3A5, confirming their unpublished work suggest that Sp family members could \nbind to the BTE of CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 [83].  \nAuxiliary transcription factors  \nExamination of the proximal promoters for CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and CYP3A7 reveals \na number of conserved transcription factor binding sites. Before describing these sites in \ndetail it should be noted that the literature in this area is somewhat confusing and should \nbe taken with a degree of caution due to the mixture of techniques used to identify these \nsites. Many papers quote in silico identification of binding sites, with no empirical \nevidence for functionality, whereas others have used a host of molecular techniques to \nshow functionality: The reader is thus warned to treat each assignment with caution \n 15\nuntil the experimental data is presented to confirm a putative binding site assignment. \nFigure 1 shows the suggested transcription factor binding sites for the CYP3A4\/5 and 7 \nregulatory regions, discriminating between those for which only an in silico annotation \nexists, and those for which empirical binding data has been shown. \nInitial in silico examination of the CYP3A4 proximal promoter revealed putative \ntranscription factor binding sites for Octamer binding protein (Oct1), CCAAT-binding \nprotein (CP1), activator protein 3 (AP3), and the liver-enriched transcription factors \nHNF-4 and 5 [78]. Deletion construct analysis of the CYP3A4 proximal promoter (-\n1240 bp to +11 bp) by Ourlin and colleagues demonstrated the effect of C\/EBP\u03b1 and \nDBP on the CYP3A4 proximal promoter, although exact interaction sites were not \nidentified [84]. Subsequent DNase I footprinting analysis of the initial 250 bp of the \nCYP3A4 proximal promoter has confirmed protein:DNA interactions within several of \nin silico predicted regions, as well as adding putative binding sites for sites for \nspecificity protein 1 (Sp1) and activator protein 2 (AP2) [85]. Site-directed mutagenesis \nhas been used to confirm functionality for a few sites within the CYP3A4 proximal \npromoter; Sp1 (-104 bp to -97 bp [85]), C\/EBP\u03b1 (-132 bp to -121 bp [85, 86]) and \nHNF3 (-195 bp to -186 bp [85]). Ablation of these sites resulted in either decreased \nbasal expression (C\/EBP\u03b1 and HNF3), or reductions in drug-mediated activation of \nCYP3A4 expression (C\/EBP\u03b1, HNF3 and SP1). The involvement of another liver-\nenriched transcription factor (HNF4\u03b1) in regulation of CYP3A4 gene expression was \ndemonstrated by Tirona and colleagues, who used conditional transgenic mice to show \nthat this factor was import for both basal and drug-mediated induction of CYP3A4 [87]. \nFurther examination of the regulatory regions of CYP3A4 revealed that this control was \nthrough direct binding to HNF4 binding elements located within the XREM located -\n7785 bp to -7772 bp relative to the transcription start site [87]. In 2004, Matsumura and \n 16\ncolleagues identified a second enhancer module for CYP3A4, the constitutive liver \nenhancer module (CLEM4) [88]. The location of this unit (-11.4 Kb to -10.9 Kb) is \nwithin a region of poor sequence conservation between members of the CYP3A gene \nfamily, and hence the CLEM4 unit appears to be specific for CYP3A4. Supershift \nanalysis over this region identified binding sites for HNF1\u03b1, HNF4\u03b1, USF1 and AP1, \nall of which were required for maximal enhancer activity. Such a finding is at odds to \nthe work of Tirona who demonstrated that in transgenic mice HNF1 played no role in \nCYP3A gene expression [87]; at present it is not clear if this difference is due to \nspecies-specific regulation or compensation for loss of HNF1 by other factors in the \nknock-out animals. \nDue to the high sequence identity between the proximal promoters of CYP3A4 and \nCYP3A7 it is logical to presume shared mechanisms of regulation, and therefore \ntranscription factor binding sites. Several studies have produced evidence to support \nsuch an hypothesis [79, 81, 89, 90], although it should be noted that such data is not \nunequivocal, with some differences in regulation between CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 being \nnoted [91]. Little experimental work has been done to characterise the molecular \nmechanisms underlying CYP3A7 regulation, and hence although conserved \ntranscription factor binding sites can be observed between CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 \nproximal promoter (see Figure 1) such comparisons must be treated with caution. Work \nby Ourlin and colleagues has confirmed the action of C\/EBP\u03b1 on the CYP3A7 proximal \npromoter, mirroring the interaction between this factor and the CYP3A4 proximal \npromoter, but the exact interaction site was not determined [84]. \nAs noted previously, CYP3A7 is predominantly expressed in the developing foetus, \nwhereas CYP3A4 is adult-specific; considering the high identity between the regulatory \nregions of these genes a valid question is what underlies this difference in temporal \n 17\nexpression? The previously described CLEM4 enhancer unit of CYP3A4 does not exist \nin the corresponding genomic location upstream of the CYP3A5\/7\/43 genes. As the \nCLEM4 unit appears to have implications for basal expression, as opposed to drug-\nactivated expression, then it is possible that this unit may play a role in CYP3A4-\nspecific expression in humans [88].In addition, work by Saito and colleagues identified \nan NF-\u039aB-like element within the CYP3A7 promoter (-2326 bp to -2297 bp) that is \nablated by a single base-pair change in the CYP3A4 promoter [92]. This NF-\u039aB-like \nelement was shown to bind Sp1 and Sp3, two factors that are often associated with the \nbasal regulation of gene expression [93]. The activity of this NF-\u039aB-like element was \nalso shown to be modulated indirectly through the action of HNF3 and upstream \nstimulatory factor 1 [92]. In addition,  \nIn silico analysis of the CYP3A5 gene regulatory regions has revealed a number of \nputative binding sites in common with CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 (Figure 1). In addition, \nIwano and colleagues have demonstrated that the predicted inverted CCAAT-box (-75 \nbp to -71 bp) was functional [83]. CCAAT-boxes are capable of interacting with a \nnumber of auxiliary transcription factors, including NF-Y, NF-1 and C\/EBP family \nmembers and are important in basal gene expression. Iwano and colleagues \ndemonstrated that NF-Y had the highest affinity for the CYP3A5 CCAAT-box, and that \nthis element showed co-operative binding with the BTE-associated Sp family members \nLigand-activated transcription factors  \nLigand-activated transcription factors are central to the ability of genes encoding \nproteins involved in ADME to respond to chemical exposure. These transcription \nfactors act as xenosensors and, once activated by the presence of ligand, cause an \nincrease in the expression of a target gene set responsible for the efficient processing of \nthe stimulating xenobiotic [94]. The largest family of ligand-activated transcription \n 18\nfactors implicated in regulating drug metabolism are the nuclear receptors, a super-\nfamily of 48 proteins in man [95]. Amongst these proteins are several liver enriched \ntranscription factors such as the HNFs, whose role in regulating CYP3A gene \nexpression has been covered in the previous section. However, in terms of controlling \nand co-ordinating the response to xenobiotics then the most important factor, with \nrespect to CYP3A genes, is the pregnane-X receptor (PXR; NR1I2). PXR was first \nidentified in mouse by Kliewer and colleagues [96], through scanning of a mouse liver \ncDNA library for sequences similar to the ligand-binding domain of known nuclear \nreceptors. Ablation of PXR expression in transgenic mice results in reduced basal \nexpression of CYP3A11, the murine orthologue of CYP3A4, and the complete loss of \npregnenalone-16\u03b1-carbonitrile (PCN)-mediated activation of CYP3A11 expression \n[97].  \nPXR has now been identified in several other species including representatives from \nthe rodentia (mouse [96] and rat [98]), lagormopha (rabbit [99]), carnivora (dog, \npredicted), bovidae (cow, predicted) and primates (macaque [100] and chimpanzee, \npredicted). Simultaneous identification of human PXR by three groups has led to some \nconfused nomenclature, with PXR, PAR and SXR being used interchangeably [101-\n103]: PXR will be used throughout herein for clarity.  Examination of the chicken \ngenome revealed a nuclear receptor (chicken xenobiotic receptor, CXR) with sequence \nidentity similar to both PXR (mean 40 % identity with rat, mouse and human PXR) and \nanother, closely related nuclear receptor the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR; \nNR1I3) (mean 40 % identity with rat, mouse and human CAR) [104]. As no orthologue \nfor PXR or CAR exists in chicken it has hence been postulated that CXR represents an \nevolutionary antecedent [105, 106], thus putting the divergence of the PXR and CAR \ngenes at after the divergence between aves and mammalian some 310 million years ago \n 19\n[72]. A deposited sequence for zebrafish PXR exists within GenBank, which would \nargue against such a timescale of divergence. However, analysis of this sequence \nsuggests that while it is more closely related to PXR (mean 40 % identity with rat, \nmouse and human PXR) than CAR (mean 30 % identity with rat, mouse and human \nCAR), resulting in its designation as zebrafish PXR, it is shares 40 % identity with \nCXR. The latter observation would therefore be consistent with CXR, and indeed \nzebrafish PXR, representing antecedents of the PXR\/CAR xenosensing receptors in \nmammals.  \nPXR binds to DNA as a heterodimer with RXR\u03b1 [107], and may utilize response \nelements consisting of two half sites of AGGTCA, arranged as either an everted repeat \nseparated by six nucleotides (ER6), or a direct repeat separated by three (DR3) or four \n(DR4) nucleotides. The exact choice\/binding efficiency at these elements appear to be \ndependant upon both the species [101, 108, 109] and the genomic context of the \nelement [110]. Examination of the regulatory sequences of CYP3A4 reveals an ER6-\ntype PXR binding site (PXRE) present at -169 bp to 152 bp [101-103], and ablation of \nthis site reduces xenobiotic-mediated activation of CYP3A4 gene expression [111]. In \naddition to this PXRE within the proximal promoter of CYP3A4, work by Goodwin and \ncolleagues identified two distal ER6-type PXREs (-7738 bp to -7717 bp) and (-7698 bp \nto -7682 bp) within the XREM [112]: Indeed, in vivo reporter gene assays suggest that \nthis element is of more import in determining CYP3A4 gene expression, and the \nactivation of its transcription by xenobiotics [113]. \nGiven the sequence conservation between CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 regulatory regions \nit is perhaps not surprising that a functional ER6-type PXRE is present in the proximal \npromoter of CYP3A7 [81], and this gene also utilizes an XREM containing ER6-type \nPXREs [79]. Regulation of CYP3A5 gene expression by PXR has been more equivocal \n 20\nwith initial reports showing little activation of CYP3A5 expression by prototypical PXR \nligands [114, 115]. However, a recent report has confirmed the functionality of the ER6-\ntype PXRE within the proximal promoter of CYP3A5 [116] that was first suggested by \nIwano and colleagues [83]. Thus, the regulation of drug-mediated activation of CYP3A \ngene transcription by PXR has now been demonstrated to be conserved through the \nthree major human CYP3As. Crucially, the distal XREM appears to be absent from the \nCYP3A5 gene; as this is necessary for maximal activation of CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 \ngene expression in response to xenobiotics this may explain why PXR-mediated \nactivation of CYP3A5 gene expression has been controversial [68]. \nIn addition to PXR binding to the promoters\/enhancers of human CYP3A genes it \nshould be noted that promiscuity in response element specificity exists, with several \nother nuclear receptors capable of binding to ER6, DR3 and DR4 elements. Of \nparticular note is the previously mentioned CAR. The interested reader is referred to the \nfollowing reviews that extensively cover the interplay between PXR and CAR and their \nco-ordinate regulation of CYP3A genes [117-121]. The implications of this promiscuity \nare twofold. First, that biological redundancy exists within the xenosensing systems \nwithin the body, acting as a \u2018metabolic safety net\u2019 to ensure the most efficient response \nto any chemical stimulus [122]. Second, this potential cross-talk results in an interaction \nnetwork, whereby the relative expression of receptors and\/or affinity of ligand\/response \nelement determines the gene set activated by a specific chemical [123]. This interaction \nnetwork would thus be capable of fine tuning the response to any particular stimulus far \nabove what could be achieved with a series on non-interacting nuclear receptors. Indeed \nrecent evidence suggests that nuclear receptors regulate the expression of each other, \nfurther increasing the complexity of such interaction networks [124-127]. The sum total \nof this interaction network may well go some way to explain the observed inter-\n 21\nindividual variation in CYP3A activity, with a host of minor changes (both \nenvironmental and genetic) to different factors within the network combining to \nproduce the variable expression in CYP3A genes. \nConclusion \nThe genetic regulation of the cytochrome P450 genes is nearing completion with \nrespect to characterisation. The completion of many genome sequencing projects, \nparticularly that of four higher mammals, along with the number of at, or nearing draft \nstatus means that the coding of the regulatory regions for mammalian CYP genes is now \nknown. In silico analysis has allowed the prediction of control mechanisms from this \nknown coding sequence, and finally molecular analysis have allowed the functionality \nof these predicted mechanisms to be examined. Having characterised the functional \ninteractions occurring within the CYP regulatory regions we are now left with perhaps \nthe greatest challenge, understanding how all these factors interact together to produce \nthe ultimate expression of CYPs (and indeed other proteins involved in drug \nmetabolism), and the regulation of this expression in response to stimulus. The \ninteractions of nuclear receptors are a good example of such an interaction network, and \nit is perhaps through the continued study of these ligand-activated transcription factors \nthat we will begin to understand more about how the interactome actually works. Thus \nwe are entering an exciting period of discovery in drug metabolism, where work will \nevolve from the study of the individual to the study of the system. It is this \u2018systems \nbiology\u2019 that will yield the ultimate benefits from the rigorous characterisation work \ncurrently being completed; the ability to model and predict human biological responses \nto chemical stimulus. \n 22\nReferences \n[1] D.R.
