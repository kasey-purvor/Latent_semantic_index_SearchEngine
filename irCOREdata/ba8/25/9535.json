Most studies deployed kites as \naerial instrument platforms or \u201cskyhooks\u201d. More recently, use of the kite itself as a sensor \nhas become popular2. For example, the Tethered Aerodynamically Lifting Anemometer \n(TALA)\n3\n monitored line tension and elevation angle electronically in order to infer wind \nspeed. However, TALA systems showed sufficient thermal drift to require pre- and post-\nflight corrections\n4,5\n. Here a thermally stable tension meter is described to improve kite \ntether line tension measurements for kites used as sensors.  \n \nThe wind force on a tethered sensor kite can be approximated for wind flow normal to a \nflat plate6 as \n \n2\n2\n1\nAVCF R\u03c1=\n                 (1), \n \nwhere F is the force transmitted down the kite tether to the ground anchor, CR is the \nreaction coefficient (magnitude ~ 1), \u03c1 the air density, A the kite area and V the wind \nvelocity. (Although \u03c1 is temperature dependent, the variation over the expected lower \natmosphere range will be small.)  In practice, equation (1) will not be exactly adhered to \nas kites do not fly at a constant angle of attack and continually deform under wind \npressure. This equation was used to establish a design specification for the tension meter, \nshowing a dynamic range to at least 100 N is needed for wind speeds up to about 10 ms-1, \nassuming a maximum typical effective kite area of 2m2.  A resolution of 2.5 N or better \nwas required, and, as the kite sensor is expected to be particularly useful for investigating \nturbulence, an exponential time response of 0.3 s or better was sought. \n  \nStrain gauges were used to measure the kite line tension, by measuring the deformation of \na ring carrying the tension of the kite line, to which the strain gauges were bonded.  The \nstrain gauges selected (RS Components 632-180 5mm aluminium gauge) had a 3% \noperational distortion limit, hence the ring was constructed from aluminium, to a design \nwhich restricted the maximum deformation. Initial testing showed the response was \ngreater under gentle bending than pulling. The final design therefore employed an array \nof four strain gauges arranged around a circular aluminium ring forming the sensor head \n(Figure 1), with the strain gauges precisely opposite each other around the axis of the \nring. Under tension, the sensor head elongates, causing deformation locally at each strain-\ngauge.  \n \n3 \n \n \nFIGURE 1 Design of sensing ring (diameter 80mm and thickness 10mm), with outer (1) and inner (2) \nsurfaces marked. (3) denotes position of strain-gauges on the outer surface and (4) shows the sensing head \nedge on. \n \nFigure 2 shows the schematic of the electronic signal processing used. The set of four \nresistive strain gauges are connected in a Wheatstone bridge circuit, excited by a 9V \nregulated supply derived from a 12V gel cell. Using multiple strain gauges both improves \nthe sensitivity over that of a single strain-gauge, and, because of the circuit\u2019s symmetry, it \nminimises the thermal drift for well-matched strain-gauges. The voltage difference from \nthe bridge circuit is extracted by a differential stage (IC1), and amplified by a gain stage \n(IC2). This circuit was derived from a microvolt differential amplifier designed for small \ntemperature drift\n7\n. \n \nFIGURE 2 Schematic of the signal conditioning circuitry, with component values and part numbers \nmarked. The four resistive strain-gauges mounted on the sensor head form a Wheatstone bridge \narrangement. \n \n4 \n \nThe tension meter was calibrated for forces in the range 0-100N as predicted from \nequation (1), using a variable load. Figure 3(a) illustrates the linear relationship having \ngradient (19.5\u00b10.2) mV N-1 over the entire tension range, but showing a small negative \noffset (~40mV) with no force applied. Three possible explanations were identified for \nthis, all concerned with mechanical or electronic asymmetry. Firstly, slight differences in \nthe amount of adhesive attaching each gauge to the sensor head could cause small \ndifferences in gauge curvature. Secondly, as the adhesive\u2019s thermal conductivity differed \nbetween the gauge and the aluminium, when combined with the differences in adhesive \namounts this may produce different time lags for the gauges to equilibrate with \ntemperature fluctuations in the aluminium ring. A third possible source of offset could \narise from light differences in the electrical connections for each strain-gauge, such as \nfrom unequal wire lengths. \n0 20 40 60 80 100\n0\n.0\n0\n.5\n1\n.0\n1\n.5\ntension \/ N\no\nu\ntp\nu\nt \n\/ \nV\n(a)\n10 20 30 40\n-0\n.5\n-0\n.3\n-0\n.1\ntemperature \/ degC\nd\nri\nft\n \/\n (\nN\n\/d\ne\ng\nC\n)\n(b)\n \nFIGURE 3 (a) Variation of the output voltage of the instrument for a range of applied tensions. (b) \nTemperature variation of output voltage expressed in terms of equivalent tension. Each point represents the \ndrift over \u00b12.5\u00baC around the temperature considered, and the dashed lines show the extremes of the \nvariations found.  \nThermal sensitivity of the system was investigated in a temperature-controlled \nenvironmental chamber (Design Environmental model Delta 190H). The sensitivity to \napplied tensions was determined at temperatures from 5\u00baC to 45\u00baC, limited by practical \nconstraints within the chamber to 40N. A negative temperature coefficient was found, and \n5 \n \nthe variation in sensitivity is shown in figure 3(b). The mean drift with temperature found \nwas \u20130.18N \u00baC-1 (5 to 45\u00baC range).  In field use with small tensions and temperature \nfluctuations generated by the passage of broken clouds, this drift can be used to apply a \ncorrection, by measuring the sensor head temperature. However when the thermal drift is \nless than ~0.5N during use, a temperature correction may not be necessary since such \ndrift is comparable with the resolution. \n \nThe tension meter\u2019s frequency response was investigated by applying rapid tension \nchanges. The sensing head was mounted solidly, with 0.5m of kite-line attached; its \noutput voltage response to step changes in tension was recorded using a chart recorder. \nDifferent weights of known magnitude were attached onto the kite-line by plastic cable \nties, and step changes in tension generated by cutting the cable tie to release the weights \nin turn. Large (85 N \u2192 10N) and small (75 N \u2192 25N) tension changes were investigated \nand the exponential response time derived. In both cases, the time constant was <0.2s \ncompared with the design requirement of 0.3s. The step changes in tension between 75N \nto 25N exhibited a damped oscillation of ~10Hz which decayed within ~2s: this was \nabsent from 85N to 10N data. A supporting observation was that the weight remaining \nattached to the kite-line oscillated after the first mass was detached. For a body of \u2206m \nadded to a string already carrying a mass m, the new frequency f+\u2206f of small amplitude \noscillations is given by  \nAY\nlmm\nff\n0)(2\n1\n\u2206+\n=\u2206+\n\u03c0\n            (2) \nwhere l0 is the length of the string under no tension, A is the cross-sectional area of the \nstring and Y is Young\u2019s modulus\n8\n. Assuming Y=117GPa, equation (2) suggests that a step \nchange in tension from 75N to 25N should result in oscillations of ~9.6Hz, consistent \nwith the observation.                                    \n \nField experiments were carried out at the flat grass site of the University of Reading \nAtmospheric Observatory, surrounded by large trees and buildings. The sensing head was \nattached to a Rokkaku-type kite\n9 \n(flat area 2.3m\n2\n) and the output voltage from the tension \nmeter recorded with a miniature voltage logger (Tinytag Talk 2), at 1Hz with 1mV \nresolution. The kite tension measurements were temperature corrected using the derived \ntemperature sensitivity. A tower at the Observatory equipped with an ultrasonic \nanemometer (Gill Solent Windmaster) at 10m, was used for comparison with the kite \nmeasurements. Figure 4 shows the relationship between kite-line tension and wind speed \n(measured with the sonic anemometer). In the time series (figure 4a), both the tether line \ntension and wind speed datasets show similar structures, indicating that the kite responds \nto atmospheric flow variations. Figure 4b shows the relationship of tether line tension \nwith wind speed at 10m, which, for this kite, is approximately linear over the range 1ms\n-1\n \nto 6ms\n-1\n, with sensitivity 1.54Nm\n-1\ns. \n \n6 \n \nThese field measurements demonstrate that thermally stable tether line tension \nmeasurements can provide horizontal wind speed information through using a static kite \nas the sensor. \n \n0 50 100 150\n0\n5\n1\n0\n1\n5\n2\n0\n2\n5\n3\n0\ntime \/ s\nte\nth\ne\nrl\nin\ne\n t\ne\nn\ns\nio\nn\n \/\n N\ntension\nwind speed\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\nw\nin\nd\n s\np\ne\ne\nd\n \/\n m\ns\n\u2212\n1\n(a)\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n0\n5\n1\n0\n1\n5\n2\n0\n2\n5\n3\n0\nwind speed \/ ms\n\u22121\nte\nth\ne\nrl\nin\ne\n t\ne\nn\ns\nio\nn\n \/\n N\n(b)\n \nFIGURE 4 (a) Time series (1Hz samples) of kite tether line tension (black line) and horizontal wind speed \nat 10m (grey line) for the kite flying at anemometer height.
