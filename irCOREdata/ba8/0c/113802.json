The SPOT stereo images are first \nadjusted to derive the corresponding epipolar image pairs \nsuch that the matching points lie on the corresponding \nepipolar lines of the two images. A new edge detector based \non bi-orthogonal wavelets is then used to extract the minima \nimages from the epipolar image pairs. The edge features and \nthe dense disparity estimate are derived from the minima \nimages using a novel hybrid stereo matching (HSM) method \nthat combines both feature-based and area-based approaches. \nIncorporating the dense disparity estimate, HSM then \ngenerates a final dense disparity map using the epipolar image \npairs. The results obtained indicate that this algorithm can \nimprove 3-D topographic accuracy better than four pixels \nwith a fewer number of control points needed. \nKeywords: Wavelets, DEM, SPOT, Area-based Matching, \nFeature-based Matching \nINTRODUCTION \nPassively sensing three-dimensional structure by means of \ncomputational stereo image has been addressed both from the \nbiological and computational points of view. In 1982, Barnard \nand Fischler defined six necessary steps for stereo analysis: \nimage acquisition, camera modeling, feature acquisition, \nimage matching, depth reconstruction, and interpolation [1]. \nOf these steps, image matching is considered to be the most \ndifficult to solve and is dependent on the choice of feature \nprimitives. When the matched features are low level and dense, \nsuch as the intensity at each pixel, and the matching strategy is \napplied locally throughout the image at each pixel, we call the \nmatching strategy \u201carea-based.\u201d When a few interesting \n(usually more abstract) features are first selected from the \nimage and the matching strategy is applied to this subset, we \nuse the term \u201cfeature-based.\u201d [2] Both ways have advantages \nand disadvantages. We use a hybrid approach that integrates \n\u201carea-based\u201d and \u201cfeature-based\u201d primitives. This approach \nallows it to take advantage of the unique attributes of each of \nthese techniques. Moreover, the novel stereo matching \nalgorithm combines the advantage of wavelets to improve \nDEM accuracy generated from SPOT stereo images pairs. \nIn the remainder of this paper, we demonstrate the \nusefulness of combining information from area-based and \nfeature-based approaches for DEM generation from complex \nSPOT stereo image pairs of a region in HongKong. Beginning \nwith an adjustment for image pairs to derive the \ncorresponding epipolar images pairs, an edge detector based \non bi-orthogonal wavelets is used to extract the edges images \nfrom the epipolar image pairs. The wavelet transform is used \nbecause the evolution across scale of its magnitudes and \norientation can be used to characterize localized signals like \nedges and corners. The dense disparity estimate is then \nderived from the edges images using a novel hybrid stereo \nmatching (HSM) method that combines both feature-based \nand area-based approaches. Incorporating the dense disparity \nestimate, HSM generates a final dense disparity map using the \nepipolar image pairs. Result obtained from HSM indicates a \nbetter performance in terms of DEM accuracy and \ncomputational efficiency. \nDESCRIPTION OF THE APPROACH \nFigure 1 is the flow diagram of stereo matching for SPOT \nimage pairs. \nInitial Processing \nIn both area-based and featured-based technique, the epipolar \nconstrain is used to simplify stereo matching to a \none-dimensional problem \u2013 along the image row direction. \nBut, we cannot assume that unrectified SPOT stereo images \nwould satisfy the epipolar geometry constraint because SPOT \nplatform would be subjected to nonlinear motions during the \nperiod of image acquisition. \nSome initial processing steps are performed to form the \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1 Flow Diagram of Stereo Matching \nDisparity Estimate \nOriginal Images \nPre-Geometrical \nCorrection \nCollinear Images \nFeature-Based \nProcessing \nArea-Based \nProcessing \nEdge Feature & \nDisparity Estimate \nIntegrated Stereo Processing \nSurface Feature Generation \n0-7803-7033-3\/01\/$17.00 (C) 2001 IEEE\n0-7803-7031-1\/01\/$17.00 (C) 2001 IEEE 3277\ncollinear images. First, the image pair is cropped to give a \nseries of geometry rectifies based on the images acquisition \nparameters, e.g. satellite latitude, longitude, height, and \nvelocity, off-near viewing. The second step is to provide an \napproximate epipolar alignment. This is done by providing \nmatches for four points, where each point is in the \nneighborhood of each corner of the images. These are used to \ngenerate a translation and skewing of all points in the images. \nFeature-Based Process \nFeature-based analysis provides more precise positioning \nfor the edges where there is an abrupt change in intensity \nHowever, the feature- based processing provides only sparse \nmatches (Figure 2-c) and requires interpolation as well as \nsome method for modeling occlusion. It is hard to \nincorporate the smoothness assumption into the matching \nstrategy. For the complex SPOT images, feature-based \nprocessing is not useful to obtain directly a dense disparity \nand a depth map -- DEM (Figure 2-d); but it is good idea to \ncomputer precise edge\u2019s positions and an estimate of local \nimage texture for further area-based processing dense \ndisparity generated. \nAn edge detector based on bi-orthogonal wavelets is used \nto extract the edges images--the minima images from the \nepipolar image pairs derived in initial processing. The edge \ndetector incorporates the bi-orthogonal wavelet filter using \nB-spline designed by Yu and Ho[3]. The bi-orthogonal wavelet \nfilter is used to produce edge maps with different degree of \ndetail, Figure 2-b. Edge maps are then matched using adaptive \nmatching windows that vary their shapes according to the \ndirections of the edges. An adaptive searching range is applied \nbecause the searching range of each point may be different[4]. \nThen, the disparity estimate is derived from the minima \nimages. \nArea-Based Process \nArea-based methods have been applied successfully to the \nanalysis of aerial terrain images, where the surface varies \nsmoothly and continuously[5]. They offer the advantage of \ndirectly generating a dense disparity map but are sensitive to \nnoise and breakdown where there is a lack of texture or where \ndepth discontinuities occur. In general, a smaller window is \ndesirable to avoid unwanted smoothing, however, a larger \nwindow is needed so that the window contains intensity \nvariation enough to achieve reliable matching in areas of low \ntexture[6]. So, the selection of an appropriate window size is \ncritical to achieving a smoothing and detailed disparity map. \nIn order to remedy this serious problem in window-based \nstereo methods, the window size and shape are adaptively \nadjusted based on the local amount variation in texture and \ncurrent disparity estimates. The input to the area-based \nprocess is a stereo pair of epipolar images and a pair of \ndisparity estimates from feature-based processing. \nA. Local Variation.

For these, it is \nimportant not to generate matches from the cross-correlation \ninformation. Second, where multiple matches occur, we \nselect the highest peak (best correlation) on which both views \ncan agree, and assume that order reversals due to the spatial \nshift between viewpoints cannot occur within the relatively \nnarrow fusion interval. Third, for incorrect areas representing \npoints on which the two views cannot agree, these area may be \nreplaced by the result of interpolation or feature process. \nMoreover, when multiple matches occur, we iteratively \napply the following constrains to identify the correct matched \npoint and remove unlikely matches. \na) Two-Views Constraint: If a pixel of the left image is \n\u201cmatched\u201d to one in the right image that, in turn, has not \nbeen matched to that same pixel in the left image, either \none or both matches are incorrect. Interpolation points \ndo not need to obey the constraint. \nb) Order Constraint: With a defined order of points along \na line in one image of the pair, the corresponding points \nhave to occur in the same order in the other image. \nc) No Isolated Pixels Constraint: Isolated pixels are those \npixels that have a disparity that differs more than 2.5 \npixels from the average value in the surrounding 5*5 \nneighborhood. And, pixels for which fewer than six (of \nits 24) neighbors have nonnull values are also removed. \nIntegrated and, Interpolation and Surface Generation \nFinal dense disparity map is the edge-feature disparity \nresult associated with the disparity obtained in the area-based \nprocess.

Therefore, we smooth \nthe disparity map, keeping the disparity at the edges fixed. As \nfor unmatched area points, we employ an interpolation \nalgorithm to produce a rough disparity. \nThe approach goal is not to produce a dense disparity \nimage of the scene but also eventually to calculate the \ndisparity to generate a description of the scene entity \u2013 DEM. \nWe use 3-D Direct Linear Transformation (DLT) Model to \ncalculate entities depth. 21 ground control coordinates are \nmeasured from large scale HongKong\u2019s topographic maps. \nThey are shifted to the center of the area covered by the scene. \nA least squares adjustment is applied to the DLT model to \ndetermine the 16 liner orientation parameters of the left and \nright images. Then stereo intersection is implemented \nindependently to calculate the ground coordinates of \nconjugate points -- produce the DEM of the HongKong SPOT \nimage. The results indicate that DEM accuracies can be \nachieved within four pixels, Table 1. \nCONCLUSION \nWe develop a complete and working implementation of a \nstereo algorithm and have presented some ideas whose use in \nstereo correspondence provides some impressive results on \nDEM generated from SPOT image pair. In particular, we \nprovide one use for those edges; serve as boundaries and \ndisparity estimate to limit the search for discontinuities in \ndepth or orientation. And, we have also applied a number of \nconstraints from area-based approaches to stereo matching \ninto the selecting a match from the correlation volume to \nresolve the ambiguity and verify the matches. When there are \nno edge features, it acts as a good area-based process, and \nwhen there is no texture, it acts as a feature-based system. Of \ncourse, we have only used the simplest integration of area and \nfeature-based methods to demonstrate the feasibility of a \nmore complete system.  \nREFERENCE \n[1]. S. Barnard and M.
