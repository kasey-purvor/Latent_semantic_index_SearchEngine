Ash \nlayer IIb of the Ganigobis Shale Member is radiometrically-dated at 302.0 \u00b13.0 Ma \n(Pennsylvanian; Gzhelian or Kasimovian) thus the Converrucosisporites confluens \nOppel Zone may range lower than previously thought. Preliminary study of the range \ntop of Converrucosisporites confluens in Argentina and Uruguay suggests that it \nranges higher there than in Western Australia with the possibility that the eponymous \noppel zone may also range higher than previously thought. \n \nKey words: Converrucosisporites confluens Oppel Zone; Permian; Carboniferous; \nglaciation; radiometric dating \nINTRODUCTION \nGondwanan Carboniferous-Permian glaciogenic sediments have historically \nbeen difficult to assign to the chronostratigraphic stages of the Permian because of the \nlack of marine fauna and difficulty of calibration of palynological biozones \n(Stephenson, 2008; Stephenson et al., 2007). Thus the establishment of the \nConverrucosisporites confluens Oppel Zone in the Canning Basin, in cored intervals \nfrom the Calytrix No. 1 Borehole was an advance because the zone was associated \nwith a marine fauna that allowed correlation with the standard Lower Permian stages \nof the south Urals in Russia (Foster and Waterhouse, 1988). The associated marine \nfauna was originally considered mid- to late Asselian in age, though subsequent \nrevision (Archbold, 1995) suggested an extension into the Tastubian (early \nSakmarian)\n 3 \nlatest Asselian (Text-Fig. 1; Archbold, 2001). Converrucosisporites confluens has \nbeen suggested as a possible pan-Gondwanan correlation species because, apart from \nwide occurrence in Australia, it also occurs in many other Gondwana sequences, e.g. \nIndia (Tiwari and Singh, 1981; Srivastava and Bhattacharyya, 1994); Argentina \n(Archangelsky and Gamerro, 1979; C\u00e9sari et al., 1995; Vergel, 1993); Brazil (Souza \nand Callegari, 2004); Uruguay (Beri and Goso, 1996); Antarctica (Lindstr\u00f6m, 1995); \nand Oman and Saudi Arabia (Stephenson and Osterloff, 2002; Stephenson, 2004; \nStephenson et al., 2003, 2008). Although it generally occurs in broadly coeval \nsequences associated with deglaciation, for example in the Rahab shale (Oman; \nStephenson and Osterloff, 2002), and the Carrandibby and Calytrix formations \n(Western Australia; Foster and Waterhouse, 1988), the precise constancy of its \nstratigraphic range across Gondwana is in doubt because of an apparently longer \nrange in South America (Archangelsky and Vergel, 1996; S. Archangelsky personal \ncommunication, 1998). The recognition of Converrucosisporites confluens in a well-\npreserved, diverse assemblage alongside other accessory taxa of the \nConverrucosisporites confluens Oppel Zone within a radiometrically-dated sequence \nin Namibia has allowed a non-paleontological assessment of the age of the biozone. \nGANIGOBIS SHALE MEMBER \nThe assemblage was recovered from the Ganigobis Shale Member of the glaciogenic \nDwyka Group, the lowermost stratigraphic unit of the Karoo Supergroup in southern \nNamibia (Text-Fig. 2; Visser, 1997). The Dwyka Group can be subdivided into four \nupward-fining deglaciation sequences, each capped by relatively fine-grained \nglaciolacustrine or glaciomarine deposits (Text-Fig. 3). Deglaciation Sequence 2 \n(DS2) comprises a strongly heterolithic upward-fining unit which was formed in a \n 4 \npredominantly marine or subaquatic environment (Bangert, 2000). The uppermost \npart of DS2 comprises a thick mudstone unit, known as the Ganigobis Shale Member, \nwhich contains abundant marine macro and ichnofossils as well as extrabasinally-\nderived ashfall tuff beds. In its type area, in the vicinity of Tses and Ganigobis, the \nGanigobis Shale Member is mainly exposed in eroded river banks of the Fish River \nand its tributaries from the east and north (Asab, Ganigobis and Tses rivers). The \nGanigobis Shale Member near Ganigobis contains 21 fine-grained ash-fall derived \ntuff beds which occur in 8 sets (Bangert, 2000).  \nThe largest outcrop of the lower part of the Ganigobis Shale Member is \nsituated on the banks of the Fish River north of Ganigobis. Cliffs, which reach a \nmaximum height of 18 m with an average of 3-10 m, stretch along the Fish River \ncreating continuous outcrops over a length of 2.5 km. The lowermost part of the \nGanigobis Shale Member is characterised by a rapid transition from dropstone-\nbearing mudstones (diamictites) to mainly dropstone-free mudstones with interbedded \nphosphatic-siliceous concretions enclosing remains of paleoniscoid fishes (Bangert et \nal., 1999). Sixteen of the twenty-one tuff beds are present in this part. The \npalynological samples for this study were collected by Dr D. Condon about 2.5 km \nnorth of Ganigobis on the banks of the Fish River at two nearby locations (25\u00b048.621\u2019 \nS, 18\u00b000.340\u2019 E and 25\u00b048.743\u2019 S, 18\u00b000.477\u2019 E) within a sequence with a diamictite \nat the base and dark mudstone with concretions above (Text-Fig. 4). The second \nlocality is pictured in Text-Fig. 5. Bangert et al. (1999) identified three sets of ash \nlayers (termed I, II and III) in this area and the first two sets which consist of a triplet \nand doublet respectively are present in the locations where palynological samples \nwere taken (Fig. 3). The upper ash layer of Set II (Ash Layer IIb at 25\u00b053\u201935\u201dS, \n 5 \n18\u00b000\u201951\u201dE, south of Ganigobis ; Fig. 4) gave SHRIMP-based age determinations \nfrom juvenile magmatic zircons of 302.0 \u00b13.0 Ma (Bangert, 2000). This range (299 - \n305 Ma) places Ash Layer IIb entirely within the Pennsylvanian, Gzhelian or \nKasimovian (Gradstein et al., 2004; Ramezani et al., 2007). \nPALYNOLOGY \nSeven samples (A to E, G, H) were processed for palynology. A and B contain \nthe most diverse and best-preserved assemblages, while those above contain \nprogressively poorer-yielding assemblages. The most common taxa occurring in the \nseven samples are Alisporites indarraensis, Converrucosisporites grandegranulatus, \nCristatisporites spp., Horriditriletes uruguaiensis, Lundladispora braziliensis, \nLundbladispora spp., Microbaculispora tentula, Vittatina spp., and indeterminate \nbisaccate and monosaccate pollen (full author citations given in Appendix 1; Plates 1 \nand 2). Also present in small numbers in samples A and B is Converrucosisporites \nconfluens along with Cannanoropollis spp., Caheniasaccites ovatus, Cycadopites \ncymbatus, Horriditriletes ramosus, Plicatipollenites spp., and Striatoabieites \nmultistriatus. The Converrucosisporites confluens Oppel Zone is defined by the \npresence of at least four of fourteen specified accessory taxa along with the \neponymous taxon, and those listed above are amongst the specified accessory taxa \n(see Foster and Waterhouse, 1988). Thus assemblages A and B can be assigned to the \nConverrucosisporites confluens Oppel Zone. The latest Asselian to Tastubian age \nattributed to the biozone by Archbold (2001) corresponds to an approximate age range \nof 295 Ma to 290 Ma (M. Schmitz, personal communication, 2007; Gradstein et al., \n2004) which is younger than the age suggested by radiometric dating. \n 6 \nDISCUSSION \nThere are three explanations for the conflicting ages suggested for the \nConverrucosporites confluens Oppel Zone: (1) the age range suggested in Australia is \nincorrect; (2) the age range varies across Gondwana; and (3) the radiometric age of \nthe Ganigobis Member is incorrect. \nAge range suggested from Australian studies \nAges for palynological biozones in the Early Permian of Australia rely most \nheavily on ammonoids and brachiopods within palyniferous sequences of Western \nAustralia (Foster and Archbold, 2001). Ammonoids provide the key control points \nwith Russian (south Urals) standard sequences, particularly of the Sakmarian and \nArtinskian stages, despite being patchy in their stratigraphic and geographic \ndistribution. Brachiopods are abundant at some levels but show a high degree of \nendemism (Foster and Archbold, 2001) so that only brachiopods of the Family \nSpiriferidae can allow correlation with the Urals (Foster and Archbold, 2001). \nHowever no Asselian ammonoids occur in Western Australia (Leonova, 1998; Foster \nand Archbold, 2001), and there are no independent dates for the lowest \nCarboniferous-Permian brachiopod biozone of Western Australia, the Lyonia lyoni \nBiozone, which is based on taxa endemic to Gondwana. The approximately coeval \nLyonia bourkei Biozone of eastern Australia also lacks evidence for age (Briggs, \n1998). \nThe upper age limit of the Converrucosporites confluens Oppel Zone was \nassessed by Archbold (1995) as Tastubian on the basis of ammonoids, and is therefore \nprobably correct since ammonoids are well known and used in Russian Permian \n 7 \nstratotype biostratigraphy. Archbold (1995) did not specify the lower limit of the age \nof the biozone, referring only to it \u2018\u2026ranging down into the Asselian\u2019. In his more \nrecent publications, however, the base of the biozone is shown in the uppermost \nAsselian where it correlates with the base of the brachiopod Lyonia lyoni Biozone \n(Archbold, 2001). The endemism of the Lyonia lyoni Biozone brachiopods and the \nabsence of ammonoids, fusulinids and conodonts prevents any independent date, thus \nthe age of the base of the Converrucosporites confluens Oppel Zone is unknown but \ncould extend lower than the latest Asselian age originally suggested, and be as low as \nthe latest Carboniferous (Gzhelian). Thus the lower limit of the age of the \nConverrucosporites confluens Oppel Zone in Western Australia could be consistent \nwith that suggested by radiometric dates from the Ganigobis Shale Member. \nAge range across Gondwana \nThere is very little direct independent evidence for the age of the \nConverrucosporites confluens Oppel Zone outside Australia. In Oman the zone has a \nrange top well below the Haushi limestone which contains Sterlitamakian (late \nSakmarian) fusulinids (Angiolini et al., 2006), but its lower limit cannot be assessed \nindependently because of the lack of paleontological or other radiometric evidence at \nthis level. \nConverrucosporites confluens was first described from Argentina by \nArchangelsky and Gamerro (1979) and since then has been recorded widely in South \nAmerica. A number of studies show its range as extending the length of the \nCristatisporites Zone and into the Striatites Zone in Argentina (e.g. Playford and \nDino, 2002). There appear to be no independent dates for the Cristatisporites Zone \n 8 \n(see Playford and Dino, 2002), but radioisotopic dating of the Argentinian Striatites \nBiozone (Melchor, 2000) gives 266.3 \u00b1 0.8 Ma (Wordian, Middle Permian according \nto Gradstein et al., 2004). A similar range for Converrucosporites confluens through \nthe Cristatisporites Zone and Striatites Zone is also indicated in Uruguay \n(Archangelsky and Vergel, 1996). In the Brazilian Paran\u00e1 Basin Converrucosporites \nconfluens first occurs at the base of the Vittatina costabilis Interval Zone (Souza and \nCallegari, 2004). Radiometric dates for the middle part of the Rio Bonito Formation \nwhich broadly corresponds to the Vittatina costabilis Interval Zone include 296.9 \u00b11.4 \nMa and 299.1 \u00b12.6 Ma (Guerra-Sommer et al., 2005; see also C\u00e9sari, 2007) and \n298.5\u00b12.6 Ma (Rocha-Campos et al., 2006). Though it is not possible to estimate the \ntime interval between the dated horizons and the base of the Rio Bonito Formation, it \nis clear that this base and the level of the base of the Vittatina costabilis Interval Zone \nis older and may approximate to the level of the Carboniferous-Permian boundary (i.e. \n298.9 +0.31\/\u20130.15 Ma; Ramezani et al., 2007) as suggested by C\u00e9sari (2007). Thus \nthe age of the first occurrence of Converrucosporites confluens may approximate to \nthe Carboniferous-Permian boundary in the Paran\u00e1 Basin. Since the presence of \nConverrucosporites confluens is a prerequisite for the eponymous oppel zone, it is \npossible that the age of the zone itself is closer to the age suggested by the Ganigobis \nShale Member than to the original lower limit of the range in Western Australia. \nRadiometric age of the Ganigobis Shale Member \nAs well as the 302.0 \u00b13.0 Ma age of Ash Layer IIb north of Ganigobis, \nBangert et al. (1999) also gave an age for other ash layers within the Ganigobis Shale \nMember of 299.2 \u00b13.2 Ma from a road cut locality east of Ganigobis, near Tses. Both \nthese ages are still substantially older than the age corresponding to the lower limit \n 9 \nof the range of the Converrucosporites confluens Oppel Zone in Western Australia \n(approximately 295 Ma).  \nStollhofen et al. (2008) indicated that the AS3 zircon standard (Duluth \nComplex gabbroic anorthosite) was used as the standard for U\/Pb calibration for the \nGanigobis dating. The SL13 Australian National University zircon standard was used \nonly for determination of U and Th concentrations relative to those measured in the \nstandard. Thus the doubts expressed as to the veracity of the SL13 standard (e.g. \nBlack et al. 2003; Foster and Archbold, 2001) do not apply. \nIf the margins for error of 3.0 Ma and 3.2 Ma were taken as ranges entirely \nyounger than the quoted means, then the resulting figures, 299 Ma and 296 Ma \nrespectively, would suggest that the discrepancy between the original Western \nAustralian lower age limit for the Converrucosporites confluens Oppel Zone and the \nradiometric age of the Ganigobis Shale Member is much smaller. \nIn conclusion, it seems likely that the upper limit of the range of \nConverrucosporites confluens is quite variable in Gondwana, being Tastubian in \nAustralia and probably in Oman, but possibly younger in South America. The purely \npaleontological evidence for the lower limit of the Converrucosporites confluens \nOppel Zone in Western Australia is rather weak and the radiometric ages from the \nParan\u00e1 Basin and Ganigobis Shale Member indicate a range base of at least latest \nCarboniferous, Kasimovian\/Gzhelian, or earliest Asselian, which may also apply in \nWestern Australia. \n 10 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThanks to Dr Dan Condon for collecting samples, and to Randall Penney, Gordon \nForbes, and the staff of the processing laboratories of Petroleum Development Oman \nfor arranging the processing of the samples.
