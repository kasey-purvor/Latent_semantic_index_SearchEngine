However,\noften available organ transplants might well depend on\ninstitutional frameworks rather than on individual\ndemand, namely the specific regulations in each country\nas well as individuals' awareness of this legislation.\nIn June 2006, the European Commission issued a consul-\ntation document concerning the state of organ donation\nand transplant policy at the European level [1]. The dis-\ncussion of European Union (EU) level policy regarding\norgan transplant and donation policy highlights not only\nthe heterogeneity of organ donation policy throughout\nEurope but also the importance of understanding what\nsuccessful policies could be enacted. A clearer picture of\nthe decision-making process behind organ donation rates\nshould inform this policy process. While some analysis\nhas been undertaken on the empirical determinants of\neffective organ procurement rates, evidence on the under-\nlying behavioral explanations of such decisions and the\nextent to which they are influenced by the particular legis-\nlative setting to which individuals are subject has been\nmore limited [2].\nThis paper contributes to the literature by examining how\nindividuals' perceptions about institutional frameworks\naffect individuals' willingness to donate their own organs\nand those of relatives by using data from the European\nUnion and extending findings of other studies attempting\nto compare European Union experience with that of the\nUS [3]. We examine the influence of national-level organ\ndonation policy (presumed consent, enforced presumed\nconsent and informed consent) as well as awareness of\nthis legislation along with other individual determinants\nof willingness to become a posthumous organ donor and\nconsent to the donation of a deceased family member's\norgans. We use an interactive variable to specifically look\nat how the role of legislation type and awareness of that\nlegislation might depend on each other to impact willing-\nness to donate. We also examine the roles of social inter-\nactions (and collective efficiency), having a political\naffiliation (indication of interest in community affairs)\nand specific political affiliation in determining willing-\nness to donate. Understanding the role of the community\nallows us to examine whether choosing to donate has\nunderlying societal motivations since donation might be\nseen as an implicit communal contract with others. Fur-\nthermore, we control for country specific effects so that\ncorrelated effects impacting individuals' values would be\ncaptured [4]. Finally, we examine the common influence\nof socio-economic (education) and demographic charac-\nteristics (age, gender) that could act as individuals' incen-\ntives to donate or to consent the donation of a relative's\norgan.\nPolicy approaches and institutional background\nA lack of organs to meet present demand has resulted in\nlong transplantation waiting lists in the US and across\nEurope. In Western Europe, nearly 40,000 patients were\nwaiting for a kidney transplant in 2003 [5]. In the US,\ndemand for organs overstretches supply partly because\nonly 42 percent of eligible organ donors end up actually\ndonating [6].\nGovernments put forward a variety of policy approaches\nto improve organ transplant waitlists. European countries\nare classified according to two types of institutional set-\ntings for confronting organ transplant needs: informed\nconsent (opt-in) or presumed consent (opt-out). In coun-\ntries with informed consent or 'opt-in' legislation, such as\nthe UK, Germany, and Sweden, an individual or his\/her\nfamily must give explicit permission for organ removal.\nPresumed consent countries such as Spain, Portugal, and\nAustria, assume universal consent without explicit regis-\ntration otherwise. The latter is more prominent in the EU\nalthough countries with presumed consent legislation can\ndiffer in enforcement levels. Enforced presumed consent\npolicy means that individuals who have not opted out of\norgan donation will automatically donate their organs\nupon time of death if organs are in a suitable clinical con-\ndition. Otherwise, unenforced presumed consent policies\nhave caveats such as allowing relatives to refuse their rela-\ntive's organ donation even though the relative has not\nexplicitly opted-out. Procurement data across 22 countries\nworldwide indicates that presumed consent policy has an\nimpact on donation rates [2]. Gimbel, Strosberg, Lehr-\nman, Gefenas & Taft and Johnson and Goldstein also\nfound that presumed consent policy increases organ\ndonations in Europe [7,8].\nIn practice, most families are consulted with regard to a\ndeceased relative's organ donation even if this relative has\nalready expressed willingness to be a donor. Approxi-\nmately half of families in the US and 42 percent of fami-\nlies in the UK refuse requests for the donation of a\nrelative's organ in comparison to 20 percent objecting to\ndonation in Spain [9-11]. Compared to an individual's\ndecision to donate their own organs, there are limited\nstudies examining the determinants of willingness to con-\nsent to the donation of a deceased family member's\norgans. Just as Bowles finds that institutional setting\nprompts individuals to display certain preferences, we\nexpect that organ donation policy will have an impact on\nindividuals' propensities to donate their own organs and\nthose of others [12].Page 2 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:48 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/48While organ donation policies might impact donor rates,\nindividual attitudes regarding donations are not always\naligned with donation behavior. Though European sur-\nveys show widespread public support for organ donation,\ndonor card signing (opt-in) does not reflect this opinion.\nIn Germany, only 7\u201310 percent of individuals who are in\nfavor of organ donation carry a donor card [13]. Only 19\npercent of all adults in the UK have registered on the\nnational donor registry [10].\nHowever, an individual's willingness to donate (WTD) is\nan expression of the intention to pursue a behavior; there-\nfore WTD provides a better indication of donation rates in\na country than simply support of organ donation. Individ-\nuals can express favor towards organ donation as an\nabstract concept for society to encourage but they may not\nbe reflecting how they feel about donation for themselves\nor a family member.\nRole of individuals' characteristics in decision-making\nApart from the impact of the institutional setting on organ\ndonation, previous studies have shown that individual\ncharacteristics such as age, gender, education level,\nincome level and religious associations can play a signifi-\ncant role in determining likelihood of an individual's\norgan donation and\/or consent to a relative's donation.\nStudies on how age affects organ donation show that\nolder people are less likely to donate [14,15] while middle\naged individuals [16] are slightly more willing to donate.\nMost studies find relatively little difference between gen-\nders in willingness to donate [16] while some find that\nfemales are more likely to donate [15]. Differences\nbetween willingness to donate and actual donation prac-\ntice could have many explanatory factors including cause\nof death and family decision-making at the time of death\npotentially differing based upon gender. For example, in\nthe US, families of white, young male patients were more\nlikely to consent to donation than families of other types\nof patients [17].\nOf the many socio-economic factors that have been asso-\nciated with willingness to donate organs, education level\nis consistently one of the most explanatory. Education\nmight stand as a proxy for knowledge about health related\nissues. Studies in the U.S. estimate that individuals who\nhave attended graduate or professional school are approx-\nimately 1.5 to 3 times more likely to be willing to become\na posthumous donor than individuals who have solely\ncompleted high school [15,16].\nIn the UK, more affluent individuals are less likely to\ndonate [18] while higher income is associated with higher\nwillingness to donate in Canada [19]. Siminoff, Gordon &\nHewlett et al.'s study of family consent for the donation of\na relative's organ found no association between consent\nrates and families' educational attainment or income [17].\nHowever, knowing that a family member wanted to\ndonate his\/her organs has been found to be strongly asso-\nciated with familial consent [17,20,21].\nKnowledge about organ donation policy and the organ\ndonation process have also been found to increase indi-\nviduals' willingness to donate their own organs and those\nof a relative [22]. Fear can drive negative outcome expec-\ntations, which have been shown to be negatively related to\nlikelihood of registering to be a donor [23]. Increased\nknowledge could alleviate this anxiety connected to being\nan organ donor through disseminating factual informa-\ntion to counteract fears [24].\nWith the heterogeneity of policy and social preferences in\nthe EU, studying the variety of European experience with\norgan donation permits an assessment of the implications\nof organ donation policies.\nThe influence of social interactions and collective \nefficiency\nThe willingness to donate one's organs can be viewed as\nan expression of an individual's reciprocity, namely a\nmechanism by which an individual pays-back society for\ninclusion and social support they have experienced and\nhope to experience in the future. Accordingly, one might\nexpect individuals with a higher sense of inclusion and\nthose more involved in social interactions to be more will-\ning to donate their organs. One might wish to distinguish\nbetween contextual interactions, resulting from group\ninteraction and group composition and pure correlation\neffects, created by a single shared similar characteristic of\na group. As noted in Manski, the problem lies in distin-\nguishing between these two effects [4]. Contextual effects\ncan be controlled for, for example, by using geographical\nvariables while the latter can be measured by asking indi-\nviduals whether they could count on others and whether\nthey interact with people in their social setting (e.g.,\nneighbors). This study examines the correlation effect of\ninclusion in social setting (relationships with neighbors)\nto identify any impact of collective efficiency on organ\ndonation opinions. Furthermore, these variables would\nmeasure the quality of interactions, which are clearly dif-\nferent from specific characteristics of individuals (e.g.,\nhousehold size) for which we might control. In this case\nwe suggest, that if individuals share the single characteris-\ntic of feeling socially including through social interactions\nthen these individuals would be more likely to be willing\nto then give back to this society they feel a part of through\norgan donation.Page 3 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:48 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/48Methods\nWe use Eurobarometer survey 58.2, a cross-national com-\nparative survey that includes a representative national\nsample of 15 EU countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark,\nFinland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Neth-\nerlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Germany, United King-\ndom). Data were collected over the period October 2002\n\u2013 November 2002 but the survey was released in January\n2004. The Eurobarometer survey series is designed to reg-\nularly monitor social and political attitudes of the EU\npublic. This survey was performed under the ethical\nguidelines defined by the Public Opinion Analysis Sector\nof the Directorate General Press and Communication of\nthe European Commission. The sample universe includes\nresident citizens of the EU aged 15 and over with a total\nnumber of 16,230 survey respondents. The survey was\nconducted on a multi-stage random sampling basis so\nthat the total survey sample is representative of the whole\nterritory of the 15 countries surveyed. The first stage of\nrandom sampling occurred on the national level accord-\ning to each country's distribution of metropolitan, urban\nand rural residents. In the second stage, a cluster of\naddresses was randomly selected from each primary sam-\npling unit. Addresses were chosen systematically using\nstandard random route procedures, beginning with an ini-\ntial address selected at random. Respondents within each\nhousehold were selected at random for face-to-face inter-\nviews. Caveats to the survey include sampling procedure\nmethods and difficulties associated with measuring\nincome and education among EU member states [25-27].\nThis study uses logistic regression to analyze the determi-\nnants of individuals' willingness to become cadaveric\norgan donors and to permit the donation of a relative's\norgans, which are the two outcomes of interest. The 4-\npoint Likert scale used to elicit responses about organ\ndonation fits this kind of model because responses are not\nordinal in nature. The question, 'whatever the rules and\nregulation, would you personally be prepared to donate\none of your organs to an organ donor service immediately\nafter your death' had the response options of '1' meaning\n'yes, definitely' to '4' meaning 'no, definitely, not' and\nthen '5' meaning 'don't know.' The question, 'in hospital,\nif you were asked, would you give your consent to the\ndonation of an organ from a deceased relative' had three\nresponses of 'yes,' 'no,' and 'don't know.' When running\nthe multivariate regression, we treated the \"don't know\"\nresponses for organ donation or donation of a deceased\nrelative's organs as \"no\" responses (0 s) in a conservative\nmethod to maintain the number of observations and\nbecause both express a failure to be positively certain\nabout donating organs. We tested for sample selection\nwhen necessary but the inverse mills lambda was never\nsignificant thus suggesting that excluding the 'don't know'\nresponses from the questionnaire exerts no influence on\nthe results. We estimated using logistic models to com-\npare across the two outcomes of interest namely: willing-\nness to donate own organs and relative's organs. We\nclustered our data by country. The clustering method used\nmeant that respondents were grouped according their\ncountry of residence thus accounting for country specific\neffects and treating clusters rather than observations as\nindependent [28]. In the same fashion as in multilevel\nmodeling, we have overcome some deficiencies in existing\ndatasets such as the bias caused by clustering on a country\nbasis.\nBoth models include variables for self-perceived presence\nof serious illness (yes, no), self-perceived level of health\n(very bad, bad, good), gender, political affiliation (left,\ncenter, right, none), age, urban or rural place of living, for-\nmal education (finished education at 15 or below, 16\u201319\nor 20+, still studying), awareness of legislation type in\ntheir country (yes, no), type of organ donation legislation\n(unenforced presumed consent, enforced presumed con-\nsent, informed consent), interviewee cooperation (excel-\nlent, fair, average, bad), number of people can count on in\ncase of serious problems (none, 1 or 2, 3\u20135, 5+) and ease\nof access to help from neighbors (very easy, easy, difficult\nof very difficult). (see Table A1 in Additional file 1 for\nexplanatory variable definitions and descriptive statistics).\nWe created variables to group countries by whether they\nhave unenforced presumed consent, enforced presumed\nconsent or informed consent policies to address if country\ninstitutional setting (legislation) impacts individuals' atti-\ntudes about organ donation. The variable about the\nnumber of people respondents can count on in case of\nproblems measures sense of social inclusion while the var-\niable capturing help from neighbors measures social inter-\nactions. Both of these variables are considered indicators\nof social support level and collective efficiency allowing us\nto analyze correlation effects of social setting. We use\ninteractive variables to further investigate the impacts of\nlegislation type and awareness of legislation by examining\nthe interaction of these two variables together on willing-\nness to donate. This allows us to disentangle a caveat from\nprevious studies, namely that for the institutional setting\nto effectively determine behavior it must be perceived as\nconstraining individuals' decisions.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics\nOf the sample of Europeans questioned, 60.1 percent are\nwilling to be organ donors while only 48.4 percent are\nwilling to consent to the donation of a relative's organs.\n31.9 percent of respondents were from countries with\nunenforced presumed consent, 28.7 percent from coun-\ntries with enforced presumed consent and 39.0 percent\nfrom countries with informed consent policies. Only 31.0Page 4 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:48 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/48percent of Europeans expressed awareness of their coun-\ntry's type of organ donation legislation.\nTable 1 provides evidence indicating that institutional set-\nting matters given that regulation type appears to be an\nimportant factor in individuals' willingness to donate. As\na general pattern, we find that informed consent coun-\ntries' respondents exhibit a lower probability of willing-\nness to donate and to consent to the donation of a\nrelative's organs. This can be taken as preliminary evi-\ndence that attitudes are shaped by the institutional setting\nin which individuals are a part thus supporting the finding\nreached by Bowles [12]. However, one might question\nthis result given that other factors might be impacting atti-\ntudes such as differences in how individuals interact [4] or\nin the efficiency in pursuing collective action as a society.\nIn addition, it is important to keep in mind, that policy\nchoices can also be shaped by the culture of a given coun-\ntry and vice versa, regulations also might change people's\nattitudes.\nOf the population sample studied, 26.3 percent reported\na major illness while only 6.0 percent declared themselves\nto be of bad or very bad health. This result could reflect\nrespondents adapting to their state of illness and not per-\nceiving their major illness to be as bad as a healthy person\nwould think it is. About half of the sample was male and\n23.1 percent declared no political affiliation. 37.1 percent\nof the sample live in rural areas and 25.9 percent finished\neducation by age 15 or below. Only 1.2 percent of the\nsample exhibited poor cooperation with the interviewer.\nAbout 3.6 percent of the sample could not count on some-\none else in case of a serious problem. 34.1 percent could\ncount on 1 or 2 people, 35.0 percent could count on 3 to\n5 people and 24.9 percent could count on more than 5\npeople. About 73.0 percent expressed the ability to access\nhelp from neighbors with 26.8 describing this help as very\neasy to access and 46.2 percent describing it as easy to\naccess. 6.3 percent found it difficult to get help from\nneighbors and 6.5 percent found it very difficult.\nThe proportion of respondents who described themselves\nas definitely or likely willing to be an organ donor differed\nsignificantly between countries. For example, less than\none half (49%) of Germans expressed willingness to\ndonate versus three-quarters (75%) of all Swedes. The per-\ncentages of national populations expressing likely or\nabsolute refusal to donate varied greatly from 14 percent\nof the Spanish surveyed to 32 percent of the Germans.\nThere was also wide variation in the proportion of indi-\nviduals who were not sure if they would be willing to\ndonate. 10 percent of Swedes (the least indecisive)\nexpressed indecisiveness while Spanish respondents\nexpressed the most indecisiveness at 25 percent of all\nrespondents.\nRespondents from different countries expressed variation\nin their willingness to consent to the donation of a rela-\ntive's organ in hospital. Germans were the least likely to\nconsent to the donation of a relatives' organ at 36 percent\nof respondents while Swedes were the most likely at 64\npercent. Overall, respondents were much more likely to\nbe unsure about consenting to the donation of an organ\nfrom a deceased relative. For the EU as a whole, 30 percent\nof the population responded \"Don't Know\" when asked if\nthey would consent to the donation of a deceased relative\nwhile 17 percent offered the same response when making\na decision about their own donor status. 37 percent of\nrespondents from Spain were indecisive regarding dona-\ntion of a relative's organ versus 25 percent when asked the\nsame question about themselves. Respondents from Italy\nand the UK followed closely behind those from Spain\nwith 36 percent being indecisive about consenting to the\ndonation of a relative's organs. As was the case in being\nasked about their own willingness to donate, Swedish\nrespondents were the least indecisive in making decisions\nabout their relative's donation of organs.\n82 percent of people who said they would 'definitely' be\nwilling to donate their own organ also said they would be\nwilling to consent to the donation of one from a deceased\nrelative. Likewise, 76 percent of people who said they\nwould 'definitely not' donate their own organ also said\nthey would not consent to the donation of one from a\ndeceased relative.\nTable 1: Willingness to donate one's own and consent to donating a relative's organs by institutional setting (regulation)\nWillingness to donate own organs Willingness to donate relative's organs\nN Mean s.e N Mean s.e\nTotal 16230 0.60 0.004 16230 0.48 0.004\nPresumed consent 5174 0.64 0.007 5174 0.51 0.007\nPresumed consent enforced 4654 0.60 0.007 4654 0.51 0.007\nInformed consent 6402 0.57 0.006 6402 0.44 0.006Page 5 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:48 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/48Multivariate regression analysis\nRegression results further develop the findings of these\ndescriptive statistics. The diagnostic tests of Pseudo R2 and\npercentage of correctly predicted responses indicate that\nthe models predict a significant share of the expected\ncases, and the log likelihood test rejects the hypothesis of\nall variables being equal to zero. Values for these tests are\nfound in Table 2. Furthermore, we tested for the existence\nof multicollinearity as a result of the interactions and\nfound that because the variance inflation factors (VIF)\nwere systematically below five, multicollinearity is not an\nissue.\nTable 2 provides evidence of the positive relationship\nbetween educational attainment and awareness of the\ninstitutional setting (legislation) on the willingness to\nbecome an organ donor after death and consenting to the\ndonation of a relative's organ. Those who had finished\ntheir studies by the age of 15 were approximately half as\nwilling to become a cadaveric donor as those who had\ncompleted additional schooling. Even those who had fin-\nished their schooling between the ages of 16\u201319 were con-\nsiderably less likely to donate than those who had studied\npast the age of 20.\nExamining the demographic variables and consistently\nwith prior studies, gender appears to have a negligible\ninfluence on willingness to donate while age exerts greater\ninfluence. Older individuals (60+ years) were considera-\nbly less willing than other age groups to become posthu-\nmous organ donors. Again, this finding is consistent with\nprevious findings regarding age and willingness to donate\n[14,15]. Willingness to donate was the highest for individ-\nuals less than 45 years old. The propensity for younger\nindividuals to consent to organ donation might be due to\nless thought being given towards death at a young age\nbecause it seems farther away than for older respondents.\nLiving in a rural area and type of political affiliation have\nno significant effect on willingness to donate but having\nsome political affiliation (as compared as not revealing\nany political affiliation) is significantly associated with\nwillingness to donate.\nWe use two variables (number of people respondent can\ncount on and difficulty in getting help from neighbors) to\nexamine the particular influence of social interactions. We\nfind that individuals who report having fewer people they\ncould really count on were less likely to become organ\ndonors after their deaths. Having more than two people to\ncount on appears to increase the odds of an individual\ndonating their organs by 43 to 50 percent and a relative's\norgans by 45 to 60 percent. Similarly, although not exhib-\niting a linear effect, individuals reporting more difficulty\nin getting help from their neighbors were less likely to be\nwilling to donate.\nWe also examine the effects of regulation, the awareness\nof regulation and the interaction between both variables.\nThis analysis found that countries with a presumed con-\nsent policy had respondents with a higher willingness to\ndonate their own organs as well as those of a relative. The\nresult is even stronger in countries enforcing a presumed\nconsent policy. This may indicate that organ donation\npolicy might be endogenous, meaning that it reflects prior\npublic attitudes and values. Awareness of regulation\nincreases the odds of being willing to donate one's own\norgans by 91 percent and those of a relative by 74 percent.\nFinally, the interaction variable of enforced presumed\nconsent policy and policy awareness was significant in\nimpacting individuals' willingness to donate. This interac-\ntion variable was significant at the 99% level whereas the\ninteraction between non-enforced presumed consent and\nawareness of this policy was significant at the 90% level.\nThis indicates that in countries where presumed consent is\nenforced, awareness exerts a specific non-linear effect on\nwillingness to donate.\nDiscussion\nThis study has explored evidence of willingness to donate\nusing data representative of the European Union. We find\nthat institutional setting and awareness of institutional\nsetting affect not only procurement rates as some studies\nsuggest, but also the willingness of people to donate their\norgans. On the other hand, people seem to be more will-\ning to donate their own organs, as they might feel more\nprepared to make that decision, than those of their rela-\ntives, even after controlling for a set of relevant controls.\nOne major contribution of this study appears in the find-\ning of a significant association between willingness to\ndonate and how people view their level and strength of\nsocial support both in terms of how many people they can\nrely on in case of a serious problem and how difficult it is\nto get help from neighbors. This evidence suggests that the\ndecision to donate one's own organs or those of a relative\ncould have a relationship with the extent to which indi-\nviduals receive frequent support from others. This finding\nhighlights the importance of how a sense of inclusion\nmay influence individuals' feelings of reciprocity with the\nsociety in which they live. These results in no way imply\ncausality but a higher likelihood of individuals with\ngreater social interactions to support donation of their\nown organs as well as those of others.\nWe have found that individuals' responses regarding\norgan donation for themselves often translated into the\nsame opinion about the donation of a deceased relative'sPage 6 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:48 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/48Table 2: Determinants of Willingness to Become a Donor and Consent to the Donation of a Deceased Relative's Organ in Hospital\nWillingness to donate own organs Willingness to donate relative's organs\nOdds ratio t-value +95% C.I. -95% C.I.

While an indi-\nvidual making his own choice about organ donation\nincreases the likelihood of donation, thinking about\nbecoming an organ donor implies contemplating one's\nown death. Some individuals might be reluctant to decide\nabout becoming an organ donor since it requires thinking\nabout an event they would rather prevent and not\nacknowledge its possibility of occurrence.\nAs for the control variables, our results support previous\nstudies in showing a clear association between willingness\nto donate and level of formal education and age, and a\nnegligible association between willingness to donate and\ngender. Younger respondents who have more years of\neducation and are more aware of their country's type of\ndonation legislation tend to be more willing to donate\ntheir own organs as well as consent to the donation of a\nrelative's [14,15]. We also find some evidence of long-\nstanding illness explaining donations as individuals who\nfind themselves increasingly likely to need an organ more\nintensively perceive the benefits of organ donation. How-\never, bad or very bad health status is not associated with\nan individual's willingness to donate. Gender, being an\nurban or rural resident and type of political affiliation\nappear not to be determinants of willingness to donate,\nhowever, having some political affiliation increases the\nlikelihood of willingness to donate [16]. The explanatory\npower of having a political affiliation might be due to the\nfact that those individuals revealing some political affilia-\ntion could be more concerned with the feeling of being\ninvolved in the collective organization of society and\ninteractions with others. These activities could be less\nimportant to someone without a political affiliation thus\nleading them not to become an organ donor. Among\nthose stating their affiliation, those with views left of\ncenter seem to be more likely to donate than those at the\ncenter and right of center.\nThis study shows that decision making about organ dona-\ntion by relatives of the deceased rather than the potential\ndonor prior to death may have a downward impact on\norgan supply. This result is consistent with Johnson and\nGoldstein's finding that family objections to a love one's\nconsent might play a role in determining actual donation\nrates [8]. Reluctance on the part of relatives is not surpris-\ning however, because of the emotional factors incorpo-\nrated into making decisions for someone else\nposthumously with perhaps little or no insight into that\nindividual's wishes. Decisions made about donating a rel-\native's organs are often made under a quick and stressful\nsituation where the default 'no' position seems safer [29].\nFurthermore, we have found that countries with pre-\nsumed consent regulation have a higher willingness to\ndonate, especially if this policy is enforced. This finding\nsupports previous research showing that presumed con-\nsent legislation increases organ procurement levels [2,7].\nThe particular arguments supporting presumed consent\npolicy revolve around the fact that making a decision on\ndonating organs might require some effort (e.g., filling\nout a form) while reacting to or accepting the regulation\nmight be effortless [8]. Therefore, presumed consent pol-\nicy lends itself towards higher procurement levels because\nof individuals' tendencies to fail in performing the active\ndecision-making efforts required with opt-in organ dona-\ntion legislation. Given that individuals might not experi-\nence utility from thinking about death, one might argue\nthat where organ donation policy is solely based upon\ninformed consent, the state of choosing not to donate is\nlikely to prevail. Therefore, the reason procurement rates\nmight tend to be lower in countries with informed con-\nsent legislation could be that individuals tend to not make\na decision and therefore do not end up donating organs.\nOur results indicate that individuals' awareness of the leg-\nislation has a significant effect on willingness to donate,\nControl Variables\nBad cooperation\nExcellent cooperation 1.78a 3.80 2.31 1.25 1.88a 3.92 2.47 1.29\nFair cooperation 1.23 1.39 1.60 0.86 1.30 1.64 1.71 0.89\nAverage cooperation 0.97 -0.18 1.26 0.68 1.03 0.17 1.36 0.70\nPseudo R2 0.084 0.054\nAdjusted LR chi2(22) 967.22 840.61\nLog likelihood -10430.4 -10821.6\n% correctly predicted responses 73.30% 78.77%\nNote: C.I. stands for confidence interval\nBaseline category appears in italics\na Significant at 1% b Significant at 5%\nTable 2: Determinants of Willingness to Become a Donor and Consent to the Donation of a Deceased Relative's Organ in Hospital Page 8 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:48 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/48indicating that efforts to improve educational programs\nand informational campaigns on the social and health\nbenefits of organ donation could contribute to increase\nthe number of donations. This result contrasts that of\nBeard, Kaserman and Saba's study where education pro-\ngrams were not found helpful in impacting organ dona-\ntion rates [30] but supports findings that increases in\nknowledge about organ donation can positively influence\nlikelihood of registering for organ donation [22,24].\nAn interaction variable between regulation and awareness\nof the regulation appears as a strong and significant deter-\nminant of willingness to donate. This interaction variable\ntests the determinative power of not only regulation but\nalso whether respondents are aware of this regulation.\nFindings suggest that not only does type of regulation but\nalso awareness of regulation determine willingness to\ndonate as well as donate organs of a relative.\nAnalysis performed in this study met several limitations\nthat apart from deserving mention, could also guide\nfuture research. In general, the percentages of the variance\n(R2) explained by the models presented in this study are\n8.4% and 5.4%, suggesting that other variables not\nincluded in this study could also have a significant effect\non individuals' willingness to donate their own organs\nand those of others. By the authors of this study not being\ninvolved in setting the specific questions to be asked by\nthe Eurobarometer survey, the survey's design limited this\nstudy. In particular, the data lacks information about how\nreligious beliefs and ethnicity impact decisions around\norgan donation. Additionally, the survey does not include\ndata on family structure apart from marital status such as\nhow many individuals live in the respondents' household,\nwhich could prove important when looking at relatives'\nwillingness to donate organs since those without close rel-\natives might look upon such decisions unfavorably. Other\npotential determinants of willingness to donate, which\nthis study could not address because of data limitations\nwere risk perceptions about donation procedures or dif-\nfering treatment at hospital based upon donation status,\nknowledge about a relative's wishes for organ donation\ninfluencing a relative's choices, and to add to previous\nwork on the role of information, if greater knowledge\nabout the donation process would improve willingness to\ndonate in any institutional setting. A further issue related\nto the data is potential endogeneity in the policy aware-\nness variable. Individuals being aware of their country's\norgan donation policy could be endogenous to willing-\nness to donate as those who are willing to donate might\nalso be more likely to have informed themselves enough\nto make the donation decision or are simply more likely\nto want to learn about the topic. As a methodological\nissue, using a survey to assess an individual's willingness\nto consent to the donation of a deceased relative's organs\nmight not represent familial group-decision making proc-\nesses that typically occur when making this decision.\nFinally, this study is limited by focusing on willingness to\ndonate. Effective procurement rates are not solely deter-\nmined by an individual's willingness to donate since\ncause of death determines if an individual is even eligible\nto donate organs.\nConclusion\nThis study has attempted to examine the influence of\ninstitutional setting along with other determinants such\nas social interactions, political affiliation, socio-economic\nand demographic variables in determining the willingness\nof individuals to donate their own organs and those of\ntheir relatives. Our evidence draws from representative\ndata from the EU about individuals' willingness to donate\ntheir own organs and those of a relative. We reach several\nkey findings that support previous research on organ\ndonation regarding the influence of the institutional set-\nting (presumed consent matters), social interactions and\npolitical affiliation (donation is an act of social involve-\nment) as well as a set of controls such as age and educa-\ntion having some effect on willingness to donate.\nThis study has developed new findings by not only exam-\nining the influence of institutional effects and social inter-\nactions on the willingness to donate but also by using\ninteractive variables to investigate how type of donation\nlegislation and awareness of this legislation together con-\ntribute to willingness to donate. This paper has demon-\nstrated the influence of awareness of institutional setting\non individuals being more willing to donate their organs\nor consent to the donation of their relative's organs and\ncalls for greater attention to be paid to the role of institu-\ntional design in shaping individuals' attitudes about\norgan donation. The number of individuals respondents\ncan count on and the easier it is to get help from a neigh-\nbor in case of serious problems appear to have a positive\nrelationship with willingness to donate organs posthu-\nmously and to consent to the donation of a relative's.\nAgainst this argument, however, is a possible caveat in the\npotential endogeneity of social interactions [4] and insti-\ntutional setting [31] in the long run, which calls for fur-\nther analysis using longitudinal data. However, these\nfindings seem robust given the controls introduced and\ntests run to check the model and seem to indicate that\npublic policy plays a direct role though legislation and\nawareness campaigns about legislation type, and an indi-\nrect one by recognizing that social networks may shape\nthe willingness of individuals to donate their organs.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.Page 9 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:48 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/48Authors' contributions\nEM identified and acquired the data source.
