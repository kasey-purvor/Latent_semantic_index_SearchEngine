Whether these initiatives come under the rubrics of \n\u201ccreative industries\u201d, \u201ccultural planning\u201d or \u201ccultural development\u201d, they have at their \ncore a nexus between urban planning and cultural programming. The logic of this \nnexus is to ensure urban development facilitates the possibilities for community and \ncitizenly social democratic participation; culture is thought to be an ideal tool for \nensuring both diverse community representation and participation. However, to what \nextent are the cultural components of such urban regeneration schemes window \ndressing for middle-class cultural consumption, or are there real social and cultural \nbenefits for those publics (and practitioners) who, although being priced out of many \nof the leisure, cultural and residential facilities provided, nevertheless flock to its \nspaces?  \n \nA selection of American, Australian, British and Canadian newspaper articles clipped  \nover the last two years demonstrate the general acceptance of the \u201cjust add local \nculture and stir\u201d school of thought. \u201cCool cities may defy planning: Leaders believe \nnew image could boost state economy\u201d (Singer 2003, p. 1) \u2013 for the Governor of \nMichigan, cafes, hip clubs, street vendors and loft homes are the winning formula for \nthe attraction of the \u201ccreative class\u201d. \u201cMid-sized cities get hip to attract young \nprofessionals\u201d (Nasser 2003, p. 1) reports that in Cincinnati \u201cyoung professionals \u2026 \nwant to be part of the city's makeover\u201d and first to go will be the pig sculptures in the \ncity's downtown \u201cwhich recall Cincinnati's golden era as a pork-processing center\u201d. \n\u201cCan the arts cash in on cities\u201f creativity buzz?\u201d(Taylor 2003, p. 1)\u201cthe Canadian arts \ncommunity has caught a whiff of the urban-renewal agenda and is hot on the scent\u201d. \n\u201cRegeneration sexy? It is now\u201d (Weaver 2001, p. 1) documents \u201cconcerns that an \nurban renaissance will lead to a form of social cleansing in British cities, of the kind \nthat has occurred in New York under \u2026 Republican mayor Rudolph Giuliani\u201d. \u201cCan \nculture save us?\u201f (Becket 2003, p. 1) discusses the massive investment in cultural \nregeneration in Newcastle and Gateshead in the North East of England. In \u201cNot just a \nplace to live, but a place to work\u201d (Macken 2002, p. 22) it was lifestyle, \u201cnot the \nexchange rate\u201d that \u201cbrought one entrepreneur to Sydney\u201d. We could go on, our \nnewspaper clipping folders are overflowing with articles espousing the miracle of \nculturally led regeneration or development for cities large and small or for specific \nplaces within cities, including former (often waterfront) industrial sites or declining \ncity centres.  \n \nOver the last twenty years, one of the central developments in the local governance of  \nurban spaces and populations is the general acceptance of the notion that provision of  \naccess to, and consumption of, \u201ccultural\u201d resources is a central plank in successful \nurban development strategies. Indeed, as the above newspaper article titles \ndemonstrate, cultural policies and programs increasingly are being seen as the \nantidotes to an ever-broadening range of social, economic and political problems. \nMost recently, \u201ccultural planning\u201d has been hailed as essential to the formation of an \neconomically successful city, especially one that expects to be competitive in a global \nnetwork of \u201ccreative cities\u201d (Landry 2000; Florida 2002).  \n In the United States, there has for some time been a critical engagement with cultural  \nprograms that are designed to be part of urban planning schemas that attempt to \ninteract \u201cholistically\u201d with the everyday living needs of local communities (Zukin \n1995; Deutsche 1998). In Australia and Britain, the critical discussion is only just \nbeginning (Evans 2001; Stevenson 2003). As (predominantly British) consultants \ndevelop ever larger international consultancies marketing the \u201cTemple Bar Effect\u201d or \nthe \u201cGlasgow Model\u201d to cities as diverse as Durham in Britain, Adelaide in Australia \nand Johannesburg in South Africa, the \u201crevealed\u201d truth of these models, and their \nalmost unquestioning replication, is of concern. What is of most concern is the lack of \nrigorous research done on the cultural, economic, political and social short- and long-\nterm effects of \u201ccultural planning\u201d. What evidence is there, other than certain \nconsultants \u201csay so\u201d, that the massive public expenditure required for these \nredevelopment and re-imaging strategies actually produces outcomes that are in the \npublic interest? Certainly Temple Bar is no longer the location of local micro-cultural \nbusinesses as it was before it was \u201cculturally planned\u201d, ostensibly to benefit the local \ncultural industries. Its primary audience now is the international backpackers who go \nthere for the overpriced beer and the \u201cauthentic\u201d Irish food. Despite the mythological \nstatus of Glasgow as \u201cproof\u201d that cultural planning can cure all ills, there has to date \nbeen no research to investigate the cultural, economic, political and social effects of \nGlasgow's reconstruction of itself in the late 1980s and early 1990s as \u201ca creative \ncity\u201d. There is evidence that suggests that the benefits of this massive public \nexpenditure were limited to international tourists and the socioeconomically \nprivileged communities of Glasgow.  \n \nThis special issue has been developed to contribute to the critical assessment and  \nconversation on the relative merits and problems of cultural planning. The articles in \nthis issue interrogate the nexus of urban planning and cultural programming from \nseveral directions, and use case studies drawn from a number of international \ncontexts. Many of these articles point to a distinction in policy rhetoric and actual \noutcome; most of them point to the ways in which cultural planning has not lived up \nto its cultural, economic, social or political benchmarks. In this sense, we hope that \nthis issue is a positive contribution for rethinking the nexus between urban planning \nand cultural programming. It is only through the close and rigorous interrogation of \nthe assumptions underpinning this nexus, however it is articulated, that we will be \nable to develop achievable cultural policy recommendations that are able to deal with \nthe complex cultural, economic, social and political factors involved in urban \nplanning and development. This is a far cry from the \u201ccivic boosterism\u201d that has \ninformed much of the discussion of cultural planning to date.  \n \nThe intentions of local government cultural planning is the topic of Darren Bayliss's  \narticle which surveys cultural planning and cultural development policies in local \ngovernment authorities in Denmark. Bayliss discusses data drawn from his extensive \nsurvey of Danish urban local authorities to argue that social, rather than economic, \nobjectives are the primary focus for Danish local authority cultural plans. He argues \nthat more refinement is necessary for these strategies to be effective as social \nstrategies. Illustrating the potential for local government to achieve social objectives \nby mediating between the cultural impacts of gentrification and urban development, \nChris Gibson and Shane Homan discuss a local council program in Sydney that aims \nto respond to criticisms over the lack of spaces for live music.  \n Inner city suburb live music venues in Sydney have declined and those that remain are  \nsubject to stringent noise legislation as a result of gentrification. Through this case \nstudy and their broader discussion of the politics of regulating live music venues, \nGibson and Homan demonstrate some of the complexities of fostering cultural \nactivity in specific local contexts.  \n \nIn their discussion of inner-city studio complexes in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia  \nand Toronto, Canada, Ben Goldsmith and Tom O'Regan analyse a particular nexus \nbetween an international cultural market and local cultural planning. In particular, \nthey engage with the role of studio developments in the construction and marketing of \nan international \u201ccreative city\u201d and their impact on local communities and creative \nindustry markets. Similarly, the role of cultural planning in relation to urban \ndevelopment for major events such as Glasgow's year as a European \u201cCity of Culture\u201d \nin 1990, the Olympics in Sydney in 2000 and the Universal Forum for Cultures in \nBarcelona, Spain in 2004 is the focus of Beatriz Garcia's article. In particular, Garcia \nargues that the relatively low status given to arts programs in relation to major events \nmilitates against their stated social objectives of involving local communities.  \n \nRecently, one of the most cited examples of successful \u201cculture-led regeneration\u201d is  \nthe redevelopment of the \u201cQuayside\u201d in Gateshead and Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the \nNorth East of England. Christopher Bailey, Steven Miles and Peter Stark trace the \ndevelopment of the massive commitment to \u201cculture-led regeneration\u201d in this region \nmarked by significant economic and population decline. Reporting from early data \nbeing generated through their 10-year longitudinal research project on the cultural, \neconomic and social impacts of the Newcastle\/Gateshead Quayside development, they \nargue that \u201csuccessful cultural regeneration is not about a trickle-down effect at all, \nbut rather represents a counter-balance to broader processes of cultural globalization\u201d \nthrough its potential to assert or reassert local identities.  \n \nDenise Meredyth, Scott Ewing and Julian Thomas assess the possibilities for cultural  \nprograms to affect local identities through their capacity to promote community \nparticipation and social cohesion. Their study of a \u201cwired community\u201d initiative in \nMelbourne, Australia finds that the scheme's educational outcomes may be more \nsignificant than its capacity to build community.  \n \nIn concluding this issue, Deborah Stevenson provides a thorough critique of some of  \nthe aspirations informing cultural planning as it has come to be practiced in Australia \nand Britain. Her analysis reveals the close relations between the development of \ncultural planning discourses and the politics, personnel and institutions of \u201cnew\u201d \nLabour. She argues that, as a result of these relations, the construction of citizenship \nadopted by cultural planning is one defined in terms of a capacity for economic \nparticipation. Thus cultural planning is \u201ca tool for achieving social inclusion, an aim \nthat is imagined principally in terms of economic accumulation\u201d. If cultural planning \nis constructed in this way, Stevenson's questions its utility for social justice outcomes.  \n \nThe variety of programs, policies and strategies discussed in this special issue \nunderscores the importance of the intersection between cultural programming and \nurban planning in developing \u201ccreative cities\u201d, \u201ccreative industries\u201d, \u201ccultural \nregeneration\u201d or attracting the \u201ccreative class\u201d. As this issue makes clear, the \ncomplexities of the cultural, economic, social and political implications of such \nprograms are as multiple as their applications. It is clearly not simply a matter of \u201cadd \nculture and stir\u201d. We hope that that this issue contributes to a developing and critically \nengaged discussion on the potentials and complexities of the uses of culture in urban \nspaces.  \n \nREFERENCES  \n \nBECKET, A.
