Let M be the four-dimensional compact manifold M = T 2 \u00d7 S2 and let k \u2265 2.\nWe construct a C\u221e diffeomorphism F : M \u2192 M with precisely k intermingled minimal\nattractors A1, . . . , Ak . Moreover the union of the basins is a set of full Lebesgue measure.\nThis means that Lebesgue almost every point in M lies in the basin of attraction of Aj for\nsome j , but every non-empty open set in M has a positive measure intersection with each\nbasin. We also construct F : M \u2192 M with a countable infinity of intermingled minimal\nattractors.\n1. Introduction\nLet M be a topological space with a Borel probability measure m. Let k \u2265 2. Measurable\nsets B1, . . . , Bk \u2282 M are intermingled if they are measure-theoretically dense in each\nother. In other words, if one of the Bj meets an open set U in a set of positive measure,\nthen U meets each of the Bj in a set of positive measure.\nAn attractor A is a compact invariant set such that the basin of attraction b(A) =\n{x : \u03c9(x) \u2282 A} has positive Lebesgue measure and such that there is no strictly smaller\ncompact invariant set A\u2032 such that b(A)\\b(A\u2032) has zero Lebesgue measure [6]. An invariant\nset A is minimal if \u03c9(x) = A for all x \u2208 A.\nWe say that attractors A1, . . . , Ak for a dynamical system are intermingled if the basins\nof attraction are intermingled. Similarly, we can speak of countably many intermingled\nsets\/attractors.\nNumerical evidence for the existence of intermingled attractors was first presented in\nAlexander et al [2] for a certain class of non-invertible maps of the plane. A proof\nis presented in [1]. They did not verify that the basins occupy a set of full measure,\nbut did show that the regular parts of the basin (those characterized by typical\nLyapunov exponents) are intermingled for a set of parameters with positive measure.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n1952 I. Melbourne and A. Windsor\nvan Strien [7, Lemma 2.2] gave an example of a transitive polynomial interval map with\ntwo intermingled attractors. In the invertible context, Kan [5] announced the existence\nof an open set of Ck diffeomorphisms on the three-dimensional manifold with boundary\nM = T 2 \u00d7 [0, 1] with two intermingled attractors (unfortunately the details do not appear\nin print).\nRecently, Fayad [4] gave a new simpler construction of a C\u221e diffeomorphism F :\nT 3 \u2192 T 3 that has two intermingled attractors. This was based on the following result of\nWindsor [8] (although related results implicit in Anosov and Katok [3] are sufficient for\nthese purposes.) We use a variation on Fayad\u2019s idea for our construction.\nTHEOREM 1.1. For each k \u2265 2 there exists a minimal C\u221e diffeomorphism f : T 2 \u2192 T 2\npreserving Haar measure that has exactly k ergodic measures each of which is absolutely\ncontinuous. Similarly, there exists a minimal C\u221e diffeomorphism f : T 2 \u2192 T 2 preserving\nHaar measure that has countably many absolutely continuous ergodic measures the union\nof whose basins has full measure.\nIn this paper, we construct examples of diffeomorphisms on the four-dimensional\ncompact manifold M = T 2 \u00d7 S2 with arbitrarily many (even countably infinitely many)\nintermingled attractors.\nTHEOREM 1.2. Let k \u2265 2. There exists a C\u221e diffeomorphism F : T 2 \u00d7 S2 \u2192 T 2 \u00d7 S2\nwith precisely k intermingled minimal attractors A1, . . . , Ak with Leb\n(\u22c3\nb(Aj)\n) = 1.\nMoreover, \u03c9(q) = Aj for some j = 1, . . . , k, for almost every q \u2208 T 2 \u00d7 S2.\nTHEOREM 1.3. There exists a C\u221e diffeomorphism F : T 2 \u00d7 S2 \u2192 T 2 \u00d7 S2 with a\ncountable infinity of intermingled minimal attractors A1, A2, . . . with Leb\n(\u22c3\nb(Aj)\n) = 1.\nMoreover, \u03c9(q) = Aj for some j \u2265 1 for almost every q \u2208 T 2 \u00d7 S2.\nRemark 1.4. When k = 2, the construction in this paper can clearly be made to work on T 3\n(giving an alternative to [4, 5]). It is an interesting open problem to construct three or more\nintermingled attractors for a three-dimensional diffeomorphism.\nThe proofs of Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 are given in \u00a72, except that a technical detail\nregarding smoothness is postponed to Appendix A. For completeness, the proof of\nTheorem 1.1 is outlined in Appendix B.\n2. The construction of F : T 2 \u00d7 S2 \u2192 T 2 \u00d7 S2\nFirst, we describe the construction for finite k. Let f : T 2 \u2192 T 2 be as in Theorem 1.1.\nDenote the k absolutely continuous ergodic measures by \u00b51, . . . , \u00b5k . Let \u03c6 : T 2 \u2192 R2 be\na C\u221e map and define vj =\n\u222b\n\u03c6 d\u00b5j \u2208 R2. Then (1\/N)\u2211N\u22121j=0 \u03c6 \u25e6 f j converges almost\neverywhere with each pointwise limit lying in the set {v1, . . . , vk}. We choose \u03c6 so that\nvj \t= 0 for each j , and such that the k unit vectors wj = vj \/|vj | are distinct. (An open\nand dense set of C\u221e maps \u03c6 satisfies these properties.)\nLet D = {z \u2208 R2 : |z| < 1} and D = {z \u2208 R2 : |z| \u2264 1}. Choose p :\nR\n2 \u2192 D to be a direction-preserving diffeomorphism (that is, argp(z) = arg z).\nDefine F : T 2 \u00d7 D \u2192 T 2 \u00d7 D by\nF(x, z) = (f x, p[p\u22121(z) + \u03c6(x)]).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nA C\u221e diffeomorphism with infinitely many intermingled basins 1953\nExtend F to a homeomorphism on T 2 \u00d7 D by setting F(x, z) = (f x, z) for all (x, z) \u2208\nX \u00d7 \u2202D.\nLEMMA 2.1. The homeomorphism F : T 2 \u00d7 D \u2192 T 2 \u00d7 D has precisely k intermingled\nminimal attractors Aj = T 2 \u00d7 {wj }, j = 1, . . . , k. Moreover, \u03c9(p) = Aj for some\nj = 1, . . . , k, for almost every p \u2208 T 2 \u00d7 D.\nProof. Since f : T 2 \u2192 T 2 is minimal, it is immediate from the definitions that Aj is\na minimal set for each j . Let (x, z) \u2208 T 2 \u00d7 D such that (1\/N)\u2211N\u22121j=0 \u03c6(f j x) \u2192 vj .\nWe show that \u03c9(x, z) = Aj . Note that\nFN(x, z) =\n(\nf Nx, p\n[\np\u22121(z) +\nN\u22121\u2211\nj=0\n\u03c6(f jx)\n])\n= (f Nx, p[Nvj + o(N)]).\nNow |Nvj + o(N)| \u2192 \u221e and arg(Nvj + o(N)) \u2192 arg vj . Since p : R2 \u2192 D is a\ndirection-preserving diffeomorphism, it follows that p[Nvj + o(N)] \u2192 wj . Also, f is\nminimal, so \u03c9f (x) = T 2. Hence, \u03c9(x, z) = Aj as required. \u0001\nLEMMA 2.2. The diffeomorphism p : R2 \u2192 D can be chosen (independent of f and \u03c6)\nin such a way that F \u2212 Id is C\u221e flat at the boundary \u2202D.\nProof. The key here is to choose p decaying sufficiently slowly at infinity. It turns out that\npolynomial decay is too fast, but logarithmic decay suffices. The calculations are given in\nAppendix A. \u0001\nProof of Theorem 1.2. Glue two copies of F : T 2 \u00d7 D \u2192 T 2 \u00d7D together at the equator,\nto obtain a homeomorphism F : T 2 \u00d7 S2 \u2192 T 2 \u00d7 S2. The dynamical properties required\nof F follow from Lemma 2.1. Clearly, F is a C\u221e diffeomorphism away from the equator.\nBy Lemma 2.2, F \u2212 Id is C\u221e flat at the equator, so F is C\u221e everywhere. Since\nF\u22121(x, z) = (f \u22121x, p[p\u22121(z) \u2212 \u03c6(f\u22121x)])\nhas the same structure as F , it follows that F is a C\u221e diffeomorphism. \u0001\nProof of Theorem 1.3. The proof is identical, except that we start with a minimal\ndiffeomorphism f : T 2 \u2192 T 2 with a countable infinity of absolutely continuous ergodic\ncomponents (again using [8]), and we choose \u03c6 so that each of the time-averages vj is\nnon-zero and such that the unit vectors wj = vj \/|vj |, j \u2265 1, are distinct. Moreover, the\nconstruction of f is such that for Haar almost every point in T 2, the time average is vj for\nsome j . \u0001\nA. Appendix. The diffeomorphism p : R2 \u2192 D\nIn this appendix, we prove Lemma 2.2, constructing a direction-preserving\ndiffeomorphism p : R2 \u2192 D with the desired properties at infinity. To illustrate the\nissues involved, we begin with the one-dimensional analogue, taking \u03c6(x) \u2261 \u03b2 constant.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n1954 I. Melbourne and A. Windsor\nA.1. One dimension. Let p1 : R \u2192 (\u22121, 1) be an odd orientation-preserving\ndiffeomorphism. For s near +\u221e we take p1(s) = 1 \u2212 1\/ln s.\nPROPOSITION A.1. Let \u03b2 \u2208 R. Define G1 : (\u22121, 1) \u2192 (\u22121, 1) by G1(r) =\np1(p\n\u22121\n1 (r) + \u03b2). Then G1(r) \u2212 r is C\u221e flat at \u00b11.\nProof. Near r = 1, we have p\u221211 (r) = e1\/(1\u2212r). Let G\u02dc1(r) = G1(r) \u2212 r , so G\u02dc1(r) =\n(1 \u2212 r) \u2212 1\/ln[e1\/(1\u2212r) + \u03b2]. Define H(y) = G\u02dc1(1 \u2212 y). We show that H is C\u221e flat at\ny = 0 as y \u2192 0+. A calculation yields\nH(y) = y\n2 ln[1 + \u03b2e\u22121\/y]\n1 + y ln[1 + \u03b2e\u22121\/y] .\nNow e\u22121\/y is flat, and ln(1 + g) is flat whenever g is flat. Also, flatness is preserved after\nmultiplication by a smooth function (or dividing by a non-vanishing smooth function).\nHence, H is flat as required. \u0001\nRemark. It is important that p1(s) \u2192 1 sufficiently slowly as s \u2192 \u221e. If the decay is\npolynomial (p1(s) = 1 \u2212 1\/s\u03b1 say), then G1(r) \u2212 r is only Ck flat where k is finite.\nIndeed, for Ck-flatness we require that \u03b1 < 1\/(k \u2212 1).\nA.2. Two dimensions. Suppose that p1 : R \u2192 (\u22121, 1) is as above, and additionally\nthat p1(s) \u2261 s for s close to 0. We use (r, \u03b8) for polar coordinates on D, and (s, \u03b8)\nfor polar coordinates on R2. Define p : R2 \u2192 D by setting p(s, \u03b8) = (p1(s), \u03b8).\nLet (s, \u03b8) \f\u2192 t\u03c6(x)(s, \u03b8) be the transformation corresponding to translation by \u03c6(x) =\n(\u03c61(x), \u03c62(x)) \u2208 R2.\nPROPOSITION A.2. Define G : X\u00d7D \u2192 D by G = p\u25e6 t\u03c6 \u25e6p\u22121. Then G(x, r, \u03b8)\u2212(r, \u03b8)\nis C\u221e flat at \u2202D.\nProof. We have G(x, r, \u03b8) = (p1(\u0302s), \u03b8\u0302 ), where\ns\u03022 = [p\u221211 (r)]2 + 2p\u221211 (r)(\u03c61(x) cos \u03b8 + \u03c62(x) sin \u03b8) + \u03c61(x)2 + \u03c62(x)2,\n\u03b8\u0302 = arctan\n(\np\u221211 (r) sin \u03b8 + \u03c62(x)\np\u221211 (r) cos \u03b8 + \u03c61(x)\n)\n.\nDefine G\u02dc(x, r, \u03b8) = G(x, r, \u03b8) \u2212 (r, \u03b8) and H(x, y, \u03b8) = G\u02dc(x, 1 \u2212 y, \u03b8). By rotation\nsymmetry, it suffices to show that H is flat at y = 0 (as y \u2192 0+).\nWrite H = (H1,H2) and compute that\nH1(x, y, \u03b8) = y\n2 ln[1 + g(x, y, \u03b8)]\n2 + y ln[1 + g(x, y, \u03b8)] ,\nH2(x, y, \u03b8) = arctan\n(\nsin \u03b8 + \u03c62(x)e\u22121\/y\ncos \u03b8 + \u03c61(x)e\u22121\/y\n)\n\u2212 \u03b8,\nwhere g(x, y, \u03b8) = 2e\u22121\/y(\u03c61(x) cos \u03b8 + \u03c62(x) sin \u03b8) + e\u22122\/y(\u03c61(x)2 + \u03c62(x)2).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nA C\u221e diffeomorphism with infinitely many intermingled basins 1955\nAs in the one-dimensional case, we argue that flatness of H1 follows from flatness of g.\nSince the arctangent of a flat function is flat, it suffices to verify flatness of\ntan(H2(x, y, \u03b8)) = e\u22121\/y\n( \u03c62(x) cos \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c61(x) sin \u03b8\n1 + \u03c61(x)e\u22121\/y cos \u03b8 + \u03c62(x)e\u22121\/y sin \u03b8\n)\n.\nThis is a product of the flat function e\u22121\/y and a smooth function, and hence is flat. \u0001\nB. Appendix. Intermingled ergodic components\nFor the sake of completeness, in this appendix we sketch the proof of Theorem 1.1.\n(The results in [8] are formulated for any compact manifold that admits a free circle action.\nBy specializing to T 2, we bypass many of the technicalities in [8].) The argument could\nbe made marginally simpler by dropping the requirement that the diffeomorphism is area\npreserving (which is not required for our main results) but the simplification does not seem\nworthwhile.\nLet T 2 denote the 2-torus with normalized Haar measure \u00b5 and metric d . For a\nmeasurable set E \u2282 T 2 with \u00b5(E) > 0, let \u00b5\u2223\u2223\nE\n(A) := \u00b5(A \u2229 E)\/\u00b5(E) denote the\nnormalized restriction of the measure \u00b5 to E.\nThe required diffeomorphism is constructed using a variant of the fast approximation-\nconjugation method pioneered by Anosov and Katok [3]. For t > 0, let St : T 2 \u2192 T 2 be\nthe translation defined by\nSt (x, y) := (x, y + t mod 1).\nLet k denote the number of absolutely continuous ergodic measures desired. We divide\nT 2 into k vertical strips Mi = [(i \u2212 1)\/k, i\/k) \u00d7 [0, 1), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, with associated\nSt -invariant probability measures \u00b5(i) := \u00b5\n\u2223\u2223\nMi\n.\nThe required diffeomorphism f : T 2 \u2192 T 2 is the limit of a sequence of periodic\ndiffeomorphisms fn given by\nfn := H\u22121n S\u03c9nHn\nwhere \u03c9n = pn\/qn with (pn, qn) = 1, and Hn : T 2 \u2192 T 2 is an area-preserving\ndiffeomorphism. (We construct \u03c9n and Hn in Appendix B.2.) Clearly fn preserves the\nmeasures\n\u00b5(i)n := H \u2217n\u00b5(i) = \u00b5\n\u2223\u2223\nH\u22121n Mi .\nThe required ergodic measures appear as the limits \u00b5(i)\u221e = limn\u2192\u221e \u00b5(i)n in the total\nvariation norm.\nB.1.

Minimality of f is ensured by conditions 2 and 3 as follows.\nGiven \u0007 > 0, consider n such that En < \u0007\/2. The periodic diffeomorphism fn is \u0007\/2\ndense and every point on the fn orbit of x can be approximated within \u0007\/2 by a point on\nthe f orbit of x. Hence, the f orbit of x meets every \u0007-ball. Since \u0007 was arbitrary, f is\nminimal.\nCondition 5 guarantees that for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k the sequence \u00b5(i)n converges in the\nvariation norm to an invariant probability measure \u00b5(i)\u221e . Indeed \u00b5(\u00b7\u000f\u00b7) makes the measure\nalgebra into a complete metric space. The sequence of sets H\u22121n Mi is a Cauchy sequence in\nthis metric and hence converges to a (unique modulo null sets) measurable set. The limiting\nmeasure is the normalized restriction of \u00b5 to this set. Since the Mi are mutually disjoint\nthe limiting measures \u00b5(i)\u221e are mutually singular.\nIf \u03bd is an ergodic measure for f then there is a point x0 \u2208 T 2 such that for every\ncontinuous function \u03d5,\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\n1\nn\nn\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n\u03d5(f ix0) =\n\u222b\nT 2\n\u03d5 d\u03bd.\nHowever, by conditions 2 and 4,\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\n1\nqn\nqn\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n\u03d5(f ix0) = lim\nn\u2192\u221e\n1\nqn\nqn\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n\u03d5(f inx0) = limn\u2192\u221e\n\u222b\nT 2\n\u03d5 d\u03bd\nx0\nn\u22121,\nand so \u03bd is the weak limit of the sequence \u03bdx0n . This means \u03bd must be in the simplex\ngenerated by \u00b5(1)\u221e , . . . , \u00b5(k)\u221e . Hence, any ergodic measure must be one of \u00b5(1)\u221e , . . . , \u00b5(k)\u221e .\nSince the \u00b5(i)\u221e are mutually singular they must all be ergodic.\nB.2. Construction of the Hn. In this appendix, we complete the proof of Theorem 1.1\nby constructing the conjugacies Hn so that conditions 1\u20135 in B.1 are satisfied. Recall that\nfn = H\u22121n S\u03c9nHn. The conjugating maps Hn are constructed inductively\nHn := hn \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6 h1\nwhere each hn is a C\u221e area-preserving diffeomorphism on T 2.\nWe require that hn+1 commutes with S\u03c9n . Then we can write\nfn+1 = H\u22121n S\u03c9nh\u22121n+1S\u03c9n+1\u2212\u03c9nhn+1Hn.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nA C\u221e diffeomorphism with infinitely many intermingled basins 1957\nC11 C21\nC12 C22\nC13 C23\nFIGURE 1.

For every x, the orbit {h\u22121n+1Stx : t > 0} intersects every column\nKa,1,c and is uniformly distributed amongst {Ka,b,c \u2229 C : Ka,b,c \u2282 M\u02dci \u2229 \f1} for each i.\nHence, for qn+1 large enough, the orbit {h\u22121n+1Sj\u03c9n+1x : j \u2265 1} intersects every column\nKa,1,c and is almost uniformly distributed amongst {Ka,b,c \u2229 C : Ka,b,c \u2282 M\u02dci \u2229 \f1} for\neach i.\nNext, we prove \u0007n+1-minimality. For \u000b large enough, it suffices to prove that each fn+1\norbit intersects every \u0007n+1-ball. Choose \u000b and N large enough that for every \u0007n+1-ball B,\nthere exists a, c such that Ka,1,c \u2282 HnB. Hence, {H\u22121n+1Sj\u03c9n+1x ; j \u2265 1} intersects every\n\u0007n+1-ball. Since fn+1 = H\u22121n+1S\u03c9n+1Hn+1, this gives condition 3.\nFinally, we choose \u000b and N large enough that for all \u03d5 \u2208 {\u03d51, . . . , \u03d5n+1} we have\nmax\nx\u2208Ka,b,c\n\u03d5 \u25e6 H\u22121n (x) \u2212 min\nx\u2208Ka,b,c\n\u03d5 \u25e6 H\u22121n (x) <\n\u0007n+1\n6\n.

A modification [8] to the above arguments yields minimality and countably many\nabsolutely continuous ergodic measures. Moreover, the union of the \u2018supports\u2019 of the\nabsolutely continuous measures is of full measure. (By support, we mean the set of generic\npoints for a given invariant measure.) The argument to show there are no more ergodic\nmeasures now shows only that there are no more absolutely continuous ergodic measures.\nIndeed there must be at least one singular ergodic measure by weak-* compactness.\nBy carefully choosing the approximation by parallelograms it is possible to ensure that\nthere is precisely one singular ergodic measure, but this is not necessary for Theorem 1.3.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nA C\u221e diffeomorphism with infinitely many intermingled basins 1959\nAcknowledgements.
