Hence developing a hierarchy of\ndevice and interconnect models and an efficient simulation methodology is a key\nstep in exploring the system capabilities of molecular device based circuits, as\npart of the search for miniaturization of devices beyond CMOS, as predicted\nby the ITRS[5]. In this paper, we propose a refinement of a compact model\nintroduced by Purdue University [6, 7, 8] that describes the static or steady-state\nbehaviour of a device. The extension allows the dynamic behavior of the device\nto be modeled and hence investigation of the potential performance impact that\ngeneral molecular electronics device technology could have on Very Large Scale\nIntegration (VLSI) circuit applications.\n2 Device Model\nStatic Behavior: The transmitted current I through the metal-molecule-metal\njunction is proportional to the transmission probability T (E) describing the ease\nwith which electrons can scatter through the molecule from the source lead into\nthe drain lead for a range of energy levels around the Fermi energy of the leads.\nFrom [9], the current is computed using\n2 Ci Lei et al.\nI(V ) = 2eh\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nT (E)( 1exp[E \u2212 \u00b5s]\/kT + 1 \u2212\n1\nexp[E \u2212 \u00b5d]\/kT + 1)dE (1)\nwhere e is the electron charge and h is Planck\u2019s constant. For symmetric\nmolecules, the two electro-chemical potentials \u00b5s and \u00b5d (refering to the source\nand drain respectively) are defined to be \u00b5s = Ef + eV\/2 and \u00b5d = Ef \u2212 eV\/2,\nwhere V is the bias voltage applied between the source and drain, and Ef is\nthe Fermi energy for the contacts. In the case of weak interaction between the\nleads and the molecule, it is well known [10] that the transmission probabil-\nity can be approximated by the Breit-Wigner formula T (E) = 4\u03931\u03932(E\u2212\u000f0)2+(\u03931+\u03932)2\nwhere the variables \u03931 and \u03932 represent the broadenings of molecular levels by\nhybridization with the contacts and the molecular level \u000f0 is related to the in-\ntrinsic chemistry of the molecule. A plot of this probability and corresponding\nI-V characteristics calculated using Eq.(1) is given in Fig.(1).\n0 1 2 3 4 5 60\n0.5\n1\nEnergy (ev)Tran\nsmis\nsion\n Pro\nbabi\nlity\n0 1 2 3 4 5 60\n20\n40\n60\nBias Voltage (V)\nCurr\nent ( \n\u00b5 A) \u03b50=1.5;\u03931=\u03932=0.1\u03b50=2.0;\u03931=\u03932=0.1\u03b50=1.5;\u03931=0.1,\u03932=0.2\n\u03931+\u03932\n\u03b50\nFig. 1. The transmission probability as a function of molecular energy and correspond-\ning I \u2212 V characteristics for different coupling parameters\nDynamic Behavior: For the purpose of circuit performance investigation,\nknowledge of an equivalent time constant related to the physical description of\nthe device is sufficient for its dynamic characterization. This time constant can\nbe estimated by calculating the difference between the time spent by the electron\nin the region of scattering interaction and the time spent in the same region in\nthe absence of scattering interaction.\nThe event of scattering is described using the scattering matrix S(E) [11].\nS(E) is unitary and can be written as S(E) = exp(2i\u03b4), where \u03b4(E) =\n\u2212i logS(E) is called the scattering phase shift. For narrow isolated resonance\nwith a single open channel, \u03b4(E) may be parameterized in terms of the res-\nonance position \u000f0 and width \u03931 + \u03932 by the Breit-Wigner one-level formula\ntan[\u03b4(E)] = \u2212 (\u03931+\u03932)\/2E\u2212\u000f0 [10]. The definition of the phase shift \u03b4(E) has a veryintuitive physical meaning, as it is related to the Wigner delay time \u03c4 which is\nthe additional time spent in the scattering process compared to free motion by\n\u03c4 \u00d7 | (\u03931+\u03932)E\u2212\u000f0+i(\u03931+\u03932)\/2 |2 = 2h\u00af(d\u03b4\/dE). Hence under the weak coupling condition,\nMolecular Electronics 3\nVDD\r\nPull-up\rResistor\r\nMolecular\rDevice\r\na)\r b)\r c\r)\r\nA\r\nB\r\nC\r\ndd\rV\r\n1\rup\rR\r\ndown\rR\r\nout\rV\r\n2\rup\rR\r\nA\rX\r\nB\rX\r\nC\rX\r\n1\rD\rX\r 2\rD\rX\r load\rC\r\nFig. 2. a)A generic cross-bar circuit that utilizes a molecular device; b)black dots show\nhow the DC operating point changes with the value of the biasing resistor;c)Circuit\nlayout for the AND-OR gate; Derived truth table.\nthe time constant of the molecular device is expressed as \u03c4 = h\u00af\u03931+\u03932 at E = \u000f0.We propose to use this time constant to describe the dynamic behavior of the\ndevice as an exponential decay; i.e. \u03c4 is the time taken to reach 63.2% of the\nfinal value of the step response of the device. The current through the device as\na function of time can then be described as I(t) = Isat(1 \u2212 exp(\u2212t\/\u03c4)), where\nIsat is the pulse amplitude calculated using the static model for a given voltage.\n3 Implementation and Results\nThe model proposed in Sec.2 can be used to describe two terminal devices using\nresonance tunneling as a conduction mechanism. Such a device can be used\nas a two-terminal switch with the \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d states being a function of the\nterminal voltage. The device models have been implemented using the analog\nhardware description language VerilogA, allowing arbitrary circuit configurations\nto be simulated for static and dynamic behavior within the analog and mixed-\nsignal simulation environment from Cadence that includes the Spectre circuit\nsimulator.\nFig.(2a) shows the generic circuit arrangement for an individual device, the\nsimplest arrangement that suffices for illustration of circuit operation. A 3-D\nplot that shows the voltage across the device and the current through the device\nfor different values of R is shown in Fig.(2b). Operating points for different\nvalues of R are shown in black on the plot, where \u03931 = \u03932 = 0.1 and \u000f0 = 1.5.\nThe value of the pull-up (and pull-down) resistors in a more complex circuit\nwill thus determine the DC bias point of the molecular device, and establish\nthe regime of operation in which the device operates. Shown in Fig.(2c) is a\nthree-input AND-OR gate implemented in a cross-bar architecture [12] and the\nDC simulation of Vout for various input combinations. The connectivity between\nnodes is established by molecular devices, while the horizontal and vertical lines\nrepresent nanowires.\nThe inputs are labeled alphabetically. For this logic gate, a low input is\nheld at ground, and a high input is held at +1V . The schematic shows pull-\n4 Ci Lei et al.\na)\r b)\r\nFig. 3. a)The relationship between the speed and the noise margin of the gate for\ndifferent values of \u000f;b)Trade-off between the power dissipation and speed of the gate.\nup and pull-down resistors labeled Rup1, Rup2 and Rdown. The gate uses five\nmolecular devices XA,XB ,XC ,XD1, and XD2. In the first instance we set the\ncoupling values for all devices as 0.1 while Rup1 = Rup2 = Rdown = 1G and\nCload = 100aF . The plot in Fig.(2c) is a truth table where the output is given\nas a voltage level. The output voltages of Vout = 0.42V and Vout = 0.56V are\ninterpreted as binary \u201c1\u201d while voltages less than 0.3V are interpreted as logic\n\u201c0\u201d. It can be seen that the circuit acts as a three-input AND-OR gate.\nOne of the most important metrics of interest in characterizing static behav-\nior is the DC noise margin, which is a function of the separation between the\nhigh and low voltage levels, and is defined as (Vhigh\u2212Vlow) here for convenience.\nAs mentioned, the delay time of the functional gate is a function of the coupling\nparameters. Hence a relationship can be established between the noise margin\nand the rise time of the step response. This relationship is shown in Fig.(3a).\nPower dissipation results in heating that could have a particularly nega-\ntive cumulative impact in an ultra-dense molecular electronic system with many\nclosely-spaced wires, switches, gates, and functions. It is also crucial to estimate\nthe power for a system that has a complexity similar to that of of a representative\ndigital system such as a processor. The static and dynamic models proposed in\nthis paper and our simulation methodology allows the calculation of such quan-\ntities. The gates constructed in this PLA type architecture have static power\ndissipation, on the order of tens to hundreds of nanowatts per complex gate.\nthe I-V curve will influence the power dissipation, and this can be captured by\nthe plot of Fig.(3b), which shows the variation of static power dissipation with\ngate delay. The static power dissipation will depend on the state the gate is in,\nand a representative average for this 3-input AND-OR gate is around 2nW. This\ntranslates to a total static power consumption of around 0.002W for a system\nof 1 million gates, which can be up to several orders of magnitude improvement\non a state of the art CMOS implementation in a 50nm technology.\nMolecular Electronics 5\n4 Conclusion\nThe Breit-Wigner formula for resonant conductance is used to extract current-\nvoltage curves for a generic molecular electronic device, based on fundamental\nphysical constants related to the electronic structure of the molecule. The Wigner\ndelay time derived from the scattering matrix is used as the time constant to\ncharacterize the dynamic behavior of the device. Using the composite model,\ndigital logic behaviour was demonstrated for a molecular-device-based circuit,\nand a comprehensive analysis of performance metrics of interest including noise\nmargin, speed and power dissipation was carried out. The study reveals a separa-\ntion between distinct logic levels that is several orders of magnitude greater than\nthe thermal noise induced voltage at room temperature, and an equivalent out-\nput impedance of a few M ohms, resulting in a relatively slow (dis)charging time\nconstant for sub fF loads that dominates the internal charging time of the device\nitself. Due to the logic architecture, the power consumption has an input-patter-\ndependent static component(a few nW for the 3-input AND-OR gate considered\nin the study) in addition to the familiar CMOS type dynamic component, that\ndepends on the load and switching frequency. The general viability of molecular-\nbased electronics for ultra dense low-power applications based purely on their\nfunctional capability and performance metrics appears to be promising.\nReferences\n1.
