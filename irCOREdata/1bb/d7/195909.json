To illustrate the \ncomplexity of expression, we have assayed non-glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptor \nmRNA in isolated rat optic nerve, a preparation devoid of neurons and neuronal synapses \nand from which relatively pure \"glial\" RNA can be isolated. Of the 44 receptor subunits \nexamined which span the GABA-A, nicotinic, adreno- and glycine receptor families, over \nthree quarters were robustly expressed in this mixed population of white matter glial \ncells, with several expressed at higher levels than found in control whole brain RNA. In \naddition to the complexity of glial receptor expression, numerous neurotransmitter release \nmechanisms have been identified. We have focused on glutamate release from astrocytes, \nwhich can occur via at least seven distinct pathways and which is implicated in \nexcitotoxic injury of neurons and glia. Recent findings suggesting that non-glutamatergic \nreceptors can also mediate acute glial injury are also discussed. \n \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \nGlial cells express a multiplicity of neurotransmitter receptors capable of evoking \nphysiological cell-signals, sensitizing the cells to almost any neurotransmitter present in \nthe extracellular space. This is true in particular of astrocytes but numerous functional \nreceptors have also been documented in oligodendroglia and microglia. In a few cases the \nfunctional significance of glial receptor expression has been established. For example, the \nfeedback signal mediated by noradrenalin release from neurons to astrocytes which \nmodulates the glutamine-glutamate shunt (see Hertz, 2004). Another example is outlined \nin the article by Hertz et al., in the current issue. Glia are also richly endowed with \nneurotransmitter release mechanisms. Taking the example of glutamate and astrocytes, \nconvincing evidence can be marshaled for the presence of at least seven distinct release \npathways. Dysfunction of glial neurotransmitter release has clear pathophysiological \nimplications. Loss of astrocyte glutamate homeostasis is a prerequisite for the excitoxic \ncascade, a phenomena which is becoming recognized in an increasing number of \nneurological disorders. Recent evidence has widened the number of neurotransmitters \nthat are implicated in excitotoxic-like injury, and increased the clinical importance of \nunderstanding how neurotransmitters are released and sensed in glial cells, and the \nconditions under which these events become potentially damaging to the nervous system. \n \nGlutamate release: \nAstrocytes play the central role in removing glutamate from the extracellular space, an \nessential component of excitatory signalling in the nervous system. Astrocytes are also \nreplete with glutamate sensors such as ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors \n(see Gallo & Ghiani, 2000), and are decorated with potential glutamate release \nmechanisms. While the physiological function(s) of glutamate release and reception in \nastrocytes is a matter of debate, it is clear that excessive glutamate release is associated \nwith injury in disease states ranging from ischemic lesions such as stroke (see Hazell, \n2007) including white matter injury (Karadottir et al., 2005; Salter & Fern, 2005; Micu et \nal., 2006), through demylinating disorders like multiple sclerosis (Pitt et al., 2000) to \ndementias such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases (see Mattson, 2008). The acute \ninjury associated with excess glutamate release is mediated by a well-characterized \n 4 \nexcitotoxic cascade involving synaptic exocytosis, depolarization and further synaptic \nrelease. Clearly, this pathological cycle requires the failure of astrocyte glutamate \nregulation, while multiple lines of evidence suggest that astrocytes actively contribute to \nthe feed-forward loop by releasing glutamate during ischemia.  \n \nFigure 1 and table 1 near here \n \n There are a plethora of potential glutamate release mechanisms in astrocytes (Fig \n1), and experimental evidence can be marshalled to any or all of at least seven distinct \npathways of ischemic glutamate release: 1) reverse Na\n+\n-dependent glutamate uptake, 2) \nregulatory-volume decrease, 3) hemi-channel opening, 4) necrosis\/process loss \n(clasmatodendrosis), 5) vesicular release, 6) cystine-glutamate exchange and 7) P2X7 \nchannels. Some of these mechanisms appear to be purely pathological, such as \nnecrosis\/clasmatodendrosis or hemi-channel formation and are unlikely to mediate \nglutamate release under physiological conditions. Astrocyte necrosis\/clasmatodendrosis \nwill liberate cytoplasmic glutamate, and has been largely ignored as a significant source \nof ischemic glutamate. However, evidence for early necrosis during ischemia is strong \n(Fern, 1998, 2001; Thomas et al., 2004; Shannon et al., 2007), while clasmatodendrosis \nis apparent after a 20 min period of modelled ischemia (Shannon et al., 2007; Salter & \nFern, 2008;  Fig 2), and is very much region-specific (Shannon et al., 2007). Reverse \nNa\n+\n-dependent glutamate uptake and activation of regulatory-volume decrease represent \nmalfunctions of systems that are necessary for proper CNS operation. Vesicular release \nhas been well characterised in reduced systems (see Parpura et al., 2004) and may operate \nphysiologically in situ (Bezzi et al., 1998; Fiacco et al., 2007; Shigetomi et al., 2008), but \nthere is currently no evidence for ischemic release via this route. However, all the \nconditions for vesicular dumping of glutamate from astrocytes exist during ischemia, just \nas they do for neurons. The significance of astrocyte cystine-glutamate exchange is also \nunresolved. Located principally in glia (Pow, 2001), net glutamate release in \nhippocampal slices is only observed at cystine concentrations well above the \nphysiologically range (Cavelier & Attwell, 2005). In nucleus accumben slices, glutamate \nrelease is evoked by physiological cystine levels (100-300 nM) (Moran et al., 2005), but \n 5 \nthese values are well below the established EC50 for glutamate release via the exchanger \n(Warr et al., 1999). There is some experimental evidence for ischemic glutamate release \nvia cystine-glutamate exchange in the CNS (Fogal et al., 2007), but the balance of current \nevidence weights against this being a major glutamate release mechanism.  \n \nFigure 2 near here \n \n Oligodendrocytes are also potential sources of ischemic glutamate release, in \nparticular in white matter structures. When examined using immuno-staining at the \nultrastructural level, modelled ischemia in neonatal rat optic nerve produces a net \nincrease in glutamate reactivity in oligodendroglia (Wilke et al., 2004). Conversely in \nperiventricular white matter of neonatal rat, hypoxia-ischemia produces a significant \ndepletion of oligodendroglial glutamate indicative of net release (Back et al., 2006), \nwhile in cell culture these cells release glutamate that can activate receptors on the host \ncell and its neighbours resulting in acute injury (Fern & Moller, 2000). The significance \nof NMDA (Karadottir et al., 2005; Salter & Fern, 2005; Micu et al., 2006) and non-\nNMDA (McDonald et al., 1998; Fern & Moller, 2000; Follett et al., 2000) glutamate \nreceptors for oligodendroglia injury has been confirmed in a variety of preparations, but \nthe significance of glutamate release from oligodendroglial cells themselves vs., release \nfrom astrocytes or axons (Kukley et al., 2007; Ziskin et al., 2007; Alix et al., 2008; \nArranz et al., 2008) is not clear. \n \nOther neurotransmitters: \n To complicate this picture, glia express numerous non-glutamatergic \nneurotransmitter receptors. When examined in white matter devoid of neuronal synapses \nwhere effects are likely to be glial-mediated, physiological responses can be observed for \nATP (Fields & Stevens, 2000; James & Butt, 2002), GABA-A (Simmonds, 1983; \nSakatani et al., 1991; Sakatani et al., 1992; Constantinou & Fern, 2009), nicotinic (Zhang \net al., 2004; Constantinou & Fern, 2009), adreno- (Honmou & Young, 1995; Saruhashi et \nal., 1997; Constantinou & Fern, 2009), serotonin (Saruhashi et al., 1997), and glycine \n(Simmonds, 1983; Constantinou & Fern, 2009) receptors. While there is evidence that \n 6 \nwhite matter glutamate and ATP receptors help to coordinate the complex morphological \narrangement between glia and axons (Ishibashi et al., 2006; Alix et al., 2008), there is \nlittle information on the physiological role of other white matter glial receptors and it is \nnot known if their molecular properties differ from receptors in neurons. Despite this, \nthere is growing evidence that white matter glial receptors are important in pathological \nconditions such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, stroke, and cerebral palsy \n(Karadottir et al., 2005; Salter & Fern, 2005;  Micu et al., 2006; Alix & Fern, 2009; \nConstantinou & Fern, 2009; Nikolaeva et al., 2009; Ouardouz et al., 2009a; Ouardouz et \nal., 2009b).  \n To illustrate the variety of glial receptor expression, neurotransmitter subunit \nmRNA was examined in the perinatal (P0) neonatal (P10) and adult (<P45) isolated rat \noptic nerve (Fig 3). mRNA expression examined in this preparation is almost exclusively \nof glial origin (Salter & Fern, 2005). Lister-hooded rats were sacrificed in accordance \nwith the regulations of the British Home Office and optic nerves were excised and placed \nin Phosphate-Buffered Saline. RNA extraction, reverse-transcription and real-time PCR \nwas performed as previously described (Salter and Fern 2005). Primers were designed to \namplify short regions of each gene (80-200 bps). Reaction products were loaded on a 1% \nagarose gel and visualized using SYBR Safe dye (Invitrogen). We considered a product \nto be present if it had a single band in agorose gel, a mean C(t) value (threshold cycle, \nn=3) of <30 PCR cycles, and a single peak in the PCR melt curve. To create full-length \ncDNAs, reverse transcription was performed from either optic nerve or whole brain RNA \nusing PowerScript (Clontech) and mRNA was primed with an oligo(dT)24V primer \n(SigmaGenosys). Amplification PCR was performed with PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA \nPolymerase (Stratagene). To clone PCR products, bands were extracted from agarose \ngels, purified (Gel Extraction kit; Qiagen), inserted into vector (pGEM-T easy; Promega), \nand used to transform E. coli (XL1-gold ultra-competent cells; Stratagene). DNA \ninsertion was confirmed by PCR screening and positive clones were sequenced. \n White matter receptor mRNA expression was highly heterogeneous, with ~80% \nof the 44 subunits tested detectable in white matter (See Tables 2-5). Levels of mRNA \nwere often high, with ~40% of the tested subunits expressed at a similar level in white \nmatter and whole brain in at least one developmental point, assessed via threshold values \n 7 \nfrom real-time PCR (glycine receptor \uf061\uf034 and \uf062; adrenoreceptor \uf061\uf032b\uf02c \uf061\uf032c\uf02c\uf020\uf062\uf032 and \uf062\uf033; \nnicotinic cholinergic \uf061\uf034\uf02c \uf061\uf035\uf02c \uf062\uf032, \uf062\uf033 and \uf062\uf034; and GABA-A \uf062\uf031\uf02c\uf020 \uf062\uf033\uf02c \uf067\uf031, \uf071, \uf070 and \uf0722, each \nrepeated three times). These subunit mRNAs were sequenced but no novel splice variants \nwere found and the role these receptors play in white matter glial physiology remains \nunclear.  \n \nTables 2-5 near here \n \n Functional effects of white matter receptor activation are widely described, for \nexample glycine receptors can modulate action potential conduction in white matter \n(Simmonds, 1983; Constantinou & Fern, 2009). This is consistent with the expression of \n\uf0612\/\uf0614\/\uf062 glycine receptors subunits mRNA reported here, although expression of \uf0614 \nmRNA is novel. \uf0614 was found in white matter and whole brain at all developmental \nstages, and was the most enriched of the white matter \uf061 subunits. The presence of \uf0614 \ncould explain the unusual pharmacological properties of glycine receptors described in \noligodendrocytes (Belachew et al., 1998), which are particularity enriched in white \nmatter. \n \nFigure 3 near here \n \n Functional white matter \uf061 and \uf0621 adrenoreceptors have also been described \n(Sanders et al., 2005; Venugopalan et al., 2006; Nikolaeva et al., 2009; Honmou & \nYoung, 1995), and \uf0612 receptor protein is expressed in white matter astrocytes (Nikolaeva \net al., 2009). \uf0621 receptor activation can affect axon excitability in neonatal white matter \nbut not adult, consistent with the transient \uf0621 mRNA expression found here. Extensive \uf0622 \nreceptor expression has been reported in human white matter (Dawidek & Robinson, \n1993), and our data show this is the major white matter \uf062 receptor mRNA present at all \nages in white matter. GABA-A receptors can be activated by endogenous GABA in \nneonatal white matter (Sakatani et al., 1992; Sakatani et al., 1994; Fern et al., 1995; \nConstantinou & Fern, 2009), and a large number of GABA-A subunit mRNAs were \n 8 \ndetected with particularly high relative expression of \uf062\uf031, \uf062\uf033 and \uf067\uf031. These three subunits \nare abundant in cultured astrocytes (Bovolin et al., 1992), while oligodendroglia in the \nhippocampus (Lin & Bergles, 2004), spinal cord astrocytes (Pastor et al., 1995), and \nunidentified glia in corpus callosum (Bernstein et al., 1996) all express functional \nGABA-A receptors. The significance of these receptors in not clear, but vesicular \nneuronal-glial signalling via GABA has been reported in the hippocampus (Paukert & \nBergles, 2006). Nicotinic \uf061\uf034\uf02c \uf061\uf036\uf02c \uf062\uf032, and \uf062\uf033 subunit protein is present in mature white \nmatter, with lower levels of \uf061\uf032\uf02c\uf020\uf061\uf035\uf02c and \uf061\uf037 (Gotti et al., 2005; Cox et al., 2008), while \nfunctional receptors are present in the neonate (Zhang et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2007; \nConstantinou & Fern, 2009). The current approach showed wider mRNA expression in \nwhite matter than previously thought, with \uf061\uf032c, \uf061\uf031b, \uf061\uf031d, \uf061\uf032b, \uf062\uf031\uf02c\uf020\uf062\uf032 and \uf062\uf033 mRNA \nfound at various developmental points, an expression profile that matches that of \noligodendroglia (Rogers et al., 2001).  \n The expression of non-glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptor mRNA in white \nmatter glia indicated by the current results is similar but not identical to that reported in \nidentified grey matter glial cells. For example, while adrenoreceptor \uf0621 subunit \nexpression has been observed previously in grey matter astrocytes, little expression of \uf0622 \nmRNA has been reported in any glial cell isolated from predominantly grey matter brain \nregions (Cahoy et al., 2008; Hertz et al., 2010). This subunit is robustly present in \nperinatal, neonatal and adult optic nerve, where levels are similar or higher to that seen in \nwhole brain. Such differences in receptor subunit expression between grey and white \nmatter glial cell populations may indicate significant functional divergence in the role \nthat such receptors play in glial physiology in specific brain locations.  \n The non-glutamatergic white matter glial receptors found here may have clinical \nsignificance. For example, metabolic disorders associated with elevated extracellular \nglycine levels can produce selective white matter damage (Press et al., 1989; de Koning \net al., 2000); prenatal human exposure to the adrenoreceptor \uf0622 antagonist terbutaline is \nassociated with reactive glial changes in white matter (Zerrate et al., 2007) and \nadrenoreceptors may have relevance for disease states affecting white matter from autism \nto cerebral palsy and stroke (Laudenbach et al., 2002; Zerrate et al., 2007; Constantinou \n& Fern, 2009; Nikolaeva et al., 2009). In addition, early exposure to nicotine is linked to \n 9 \nselective white matter pathology (Froen et al., 2002; Abdel-Rahman et al., 2005; \nJacobsen et al., 2007), while changes in \uf062\uf032 subunit expression is noted in multiple \nsclerosis (De Keyser et al., 2004), indicating a largely unexplored relevance to disease. It \nhas been recently shown that neurotransmitters other than glutamate can be directly and \nacutely harmful to glial cells, in particular nicotinic and adreno-receptors in white matter \nglia (Constantinou & Fern, 2009; Nikolaeva et al., 2009) (Fig 4). The underlying \nmechanism is currently unknown, but the phenomena is consistent with the expression of \nthese receptors in glia and may have considerable clinical significance. \n 10 \nFigure legends \n \nFigure 1 \nDanger to neurons! Glutamate release mechanisms located in astrocytes can potentially \ncontribute to excitotoxicity of neighbouring neurons. Astrocytes surround all parts of \nneurons, contain elevated levels of free glutamate and are replete with functional release \nmechanisms capable of contributing to injury under conditions favourable to net release. \n \nFigure 2 \nAstrocyte vulnerability.
