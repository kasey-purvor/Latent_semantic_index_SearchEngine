Proteinuria is one of the\nessential criteria for the clinical definition of pre-eclamp-\nsia. It is part of the fundamental investigations performed\nby healthcare professionals in primary and secondary care\nto monitor disease severity and predict complications in\nwomen with pre-eclampsia. Urinalysis by visual reagent\nstrip tests is widely performed in antenatal clinics and in\nthe community by various health professionals. Total pro-\ntein estimation in a 24-hour urine sample is also fre-\nquently used to assess the severity of pre-eclampsia in\npatients admitted to the hospital. More recently, spot\nurine protein:creatinine ratio has been used to provide an\naccurate quantification of 24-hour proteinuria [1]. Esti-\nmation of the accuracy of the predictive value of proteinu-\nria by any of the above methods in predicting maternal\nand fetal complications will aid in clinical management\nby identifying the highest risk women who may need\naggressive management, and the lower risk women in\nwhom unnecessary interventions may be avoided.\nProteinuria occurs due to renal glomerular endotheliosis,\na manifestation of widespread endothelial damage in pre-\neclampsia [2,3]. The association between proteinuria and\nadverse fetal outcomes was first highlighted by Page and\nChristianson [4]. Since then, increased excretion of pro-\ntein in women with pre-eclampsia has been generally\nassociated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes [5-\n7]. However, the primary diagnostic studies that evaluate\nthe association between increase in the levels of proteinu-\nria and maternal and neonatal outcomes have not gener-\nally been conducted with sufficiently large sample size to\nprovide precise accuracy estimates. Moreover, they vary\nwidely in their definition of pre-eclampsia, maternal and\nfetal outcomes, the method used for measurement and\noptimal cut-off levels of proteinuria. There are no system-\natic reviews exploring the accuracy of proteinuria to pre-\ndict complications of pre-eclampsia. We therefore\nconducted a comprehensive systematic review to obtain\nprecise estimates of likelihood ratios of adverse maternal\nand fetal complications for various cut-off levels of pro-\nteinuria in women with pre-eclampsia.\nMethods\nData Sources\nThe review was carried out with a prospective protocol\nusing widely recommended methods [8-12]. We searched\nMEDLINE (1951 to 2007), EMBASE (1980 to 2007),\nCochrane Library (2007) and MEDION (a database of\ndiagnostic test reviews set up by Dutch and Belgian\nresearchers) for relevant citations. A search term combina-\ntion was constructed after exhaustive planning and pilot-\ning of possible search concepts capturing the relevant\npopulation, tests and outcomes. Our search terms are\nshown in Additional file 1. An initial search in Medline\nyielded 11,711 citations. The search strategy was adapted\nfor searching in Embase to obtain a total of 19,500 cita-\ntions. From this citation set, studies were selected for\ninclusion in the review in a two-stage process if they stud-\nied the accuracy of proteinuria in the prediction of mater-\nnal and fetal complications in women with pre-eclampsia.\nThe reference lists of all known primary and review arti-\ncles were examined to identify cited articles not captured\nby electronic searches. Language restrictions were not\napplied. A comprehensive database of relevant articles\nwas constructed.\nStudy Selection\nStudies which evaluated the accuracy of proteinuria in\nwomen with pre-eclampsia for the prediction of maternal\nor fetal complications were selected in a two-stage proc-\ness. We included studies that pre-specified the patients to\nhave pre-eclampsia, used bedside (urine dipstick) or lab-\noratory methods (24-hour protein estimation, urine pro-\ntein:creatinine ratio) to measure levels of proteinuria and\nassessed maternal or fetal clinical complications as out-\ncome. First, the electronic searches were scrutinised and\nfull manuscripts of all citations that were likely to meet\nthe predefined selection criteria were obtained. Second,\nfinal inclusion or exclusion decisions were made by the\nreviewers (ST and FOM) after examination of these man-\nuscripts. Studies which met the predefined and explicit\ncriteria regarding population, tests, outcomes and study\ndesign (Additional file 2) were selected for inclusion in\nthe review. When disagreements occurred, they were\nresolved by consensus (ST, KI and FOM). In cases of\nduplicate publication, the most recent and complete ver-\nsions were selected. There were no language restrictions.\nInformation was extracted from each selected article on\nstudy characteristics, quality and accuracy results. Accu-\nracy data were used to construct 2 \u00d7 2 tables of proteinuria\nresult (test positive if proteinuria levels were above the\nthreshold defined in the primary study, and test negative\nif these were below the threshold) and maternal and fetal\noutcomes.\nMethodological quality assessment\nAll manuscripts meeting the selection criteria were\nassessed for their methodological quality. Quality was\ndefined as the confidence that the study design, conduct\nand analysis minimised bias in the estimation of test accu-\nracy. Based on existing checklists [13,14], quality assess-\nment involved scrutinizing study design and relevant\nfeatures of the population, test and outcomes of the study.\nA study was considered to be of good quality if it used a\nprospective design, consecutive enrolment, full verifica-\ntion of the test result with reference standard, and had\nadequate test description. We excluded studies with case-Page 2 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medicine 2009, 7:10 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/7\/10control design as these are known to result in substantial\nbias [13].\nData synthesis\nLikelihood ratios (LRs) for positive and negative test\nresults were calculated for each study, separately for each\ntest threshold. Summary LRs were then computed where\nappropriate for positive and negative test results for each\nindividual test threshold and for each outcome of interest.\nThis information is clinically more relevant than tradi-\ntional summaries of accuracy such as sensitivity and spe-\ncificity, as LRs allow the estimation of post-test\nprobabilities of various complications for women at dif-\nferent risk levels [15]. The LR indicates by how much a\ngiven test result raises or lowers the probability of having\nthe disease. The higher the LR of an abnormal test, the\ngreater is the value of the test. Conversely, the lower the LR\nof a normal test, the greater is the value of the test. An LR\nof >10 or <0.1 is regarded as 'very useful' test accuracy,\nwhilst an LR of 5 to 10 or 0.1 to 0.2 is regarded as 'moder-\nately useful', and an LR of 2 to 5 or 0.2 to 0.5 is regarded\nas 'somewhat useful'. An LR of 1 to 2 or 0.5 to 1 is only\nregarded as 'little useful' and an LR of 1 as 'useless'.\nAlthough, this categorization is useful for interpretation\nof LRs, it should be noted that the value of a test may vary\ndepending on the pre-test probability of the condition,\nand the consequences of treatment.\nHeterogeneity of diagnostic odds ratio (dOR) was\nassessed graphically using forest plot [16] (not shown)\nand statistically using chi-squared test [17] to aid in deci-\nsions on how to proceed with quantitative synthesis [18].\nAs, for some tests and outcomes, there was either graphi-\ncal or statistically significant heterogeneity, we used ran-\ndom effects model meta-analysis [17]. Where a\nquantitative approach was not appropriate due to signifi-\ncant clinical heterogeneity, we refrained from pooling and\nthe results are described narratively and the LR of mater-\nnal and fetal complication estimated in each study is\nreported. All statistical analyses were performed using\nMeta Disc statistical package.\nResults\nLiterature identification and study quality\nFigure 1 summarizes the process of literature identifica-\ntion and selection. There were 16 primary articles that met\nthe selection criteria including a total of 6749 women\n(Figure 1) [1,19-34]. Eight articles reported estimation of\nproteinuria by laboratory method only\n[20,21,23,26,28,29,33,34], five by bedside dipstick uri-\nnalysis only [22,24,25,30,32], two by either of the above\nmethods [27,31] and one by spot urine protein:creatinine\nratio [1]. The salient features (population subgroups, test\ncharacteristics and reference standards) of each individual\nstudy can be obtained from the authors. The definition of\npre-eclampsia differed widely between the studies. The\ntest threshold in individual studies for laboratory estima-\ntion varied from 0.3 g\/24 h to 10 g\/24 h, or was reported\nas an increase in proteinuria by 2 g\/24 h between two\nmeasurements. The cut-off levels for bedside urinalysis\nusing visual reagents ranged from 1+ to 4+ of proteinuria.\nOne study evaluated the accuracy of spot urine protein:\ncreatinine ratio for threshold levels of 500 mg\/mmol and\n900 mg\/mmol in the prediction of maternal and fetal\ncomplications [1]. The methodological quality of the\nincluded studies is given in Figure 2.\nProteinuria to predict maternal outcomes\nThree test accuracy studies evaluated the accuracy of pro-\nteinuria in predicting eclampsia for cut off levels of 5 g\/24\nh, 10 g\/24 h and an increase by 2 g in 24 hours [23,26].\nThe LR of positive test ranged from 1.7 (95% CI 0.94, 3.1)\nto 2.7 (95% CI 1.1, 6.2) respectively. The negative LR\nranged from 0.41 (95% CI 0.04, 4.5) to 0.62 (95% CI\n0.28, 1.4) (Figure 3).\nTwo studies estimated the accuracy of proteinuria in pre-\ndicting placental abruption using a cut-off of increase in\nlevel more than 2 g\/24 h [23,29]. The pooled positive and\nnegative LRs for the above cut-off were 0.88 (95% CI 0.42,\n1.86) and 1.1 (95% CI 0.75, 1.6) respectively (Figure 3).\nHELLP syndrome prediction was evaluated in four test\naccuracy studies [23,26,29]. The pooled estimate of LRs\nfor positive and negative test for a cut-off of increase in\nlevels more than 2 g in 24 hours were 0.86 (95% CI 0.38,\n2) and 1.1 (95% CI 0.74, 1.6) respectively (Figure 3).\nProteinuria to predict fetal outcomes\nFetal, neonatal and perinatal mortality\nThirteen studies reported prediction of fetal, neonatal and\nperinatal mortality using both laboratory and bedside\ntesting for proteinuria [1,20,21,23,26,28-30,34]. The\npooled LRs for positive and negative test for a cut-off of 5\ng\/24 h as reported in three studies [20,21,23] were 2 (95%\nCI 1.5, 2.7) and 0.53 (95% CI 0.27, 1) respectively (Figure\n4). The largest study, involving 3260 patients, that esti-\nmated the prediction of stillbirths in pre-eclampsia was\nconducted by Taylor et al using urine dipstick method\n[35].\nNeonatal deaths were evaluated in five studies for cut-off\nlevels of 5 g\/24 h (n = 3) [20,21,26], 10 g\/24 h (n = 1) [26]\nand increase by 2 g in 24 h (n = 1) [23]. The pooled esti-\nmates of LR+ and LR- for proteinuria threshold of 5 g\/24\nh were 1.5 (95% CI 0.94, 2.4) and 0.73 (95% 0.39, 1.4)\nrespectively.\nThe threshold levels of proteinuria to predict perinatal\ndeaths were 1 g\/l, 2 g\/l and 500 mg\/mmol. The positive LRPage 3 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medicine 2009, 7:10 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/7\/10was 5.3 (95% CI 1.3, 22.1) and the negative LR was 0.55\n(95% CI 0.14, 2.2) for cut-off levels of 500 mg\/mmol [1].\nSmall for gestational age\nFour studies assessed the accuracy of bedside urinalysis for\ncut-offs of 1+, 2+ and 3+ of proteinuria in urine dipstick\n[22,24,27]. The pooled positive and negative LRs for 3+ of\nproteinuria were 1.6 (95% CI 1.1, 2.3) and 0.75 (95% CI\n0.59, 0.96) respectively. The likelihood ratio of laboratory\nestimates of proteinuria levels of 0.3 g\/24 h and 0.5 g\/24\nh were 0.96 (95% CI 0.75, 1.2) and 1.7 (95% CI 1.1, 2.7)\nfor positive test and 1.09 (95% 0.63, 1.9) and 0.73 (95%\nCI 0.52, 1) for negative test respectively, using the benze-\nthonium chloride assay (BCA) [33]. For tests performed\non the same patients using the Bradford assay Waugh et al\nreport positive likelihood ratios of 1.71 (95% CI 1.0, 2.9)\nand 2.79 (95% CI 1.4, 5.5) for cut-off levels of 0.3 g\/24 h\nand 0.5 g\/24 h respectively [33].\nStudy selection process for systematic review of proteinuria to predict maternal and fetal complicationsFigure 1\nStudy selection process for systematic review of proteinuria to predict maternal and fetal complications.\nTotal citations identified from electronic searches             n= 541\nArticles of accuracy of proteinuria in predicting maternal and fetal complications in \nwomen with pre eclampsia retrieved for detailed evaluation n=173\nFrom electronic searches                            n= 163\nFrom reference lists                                n= 10\nPrimary articles included in systematic review                  n=16\nCitations excluded after screening titles and\/or abstracts: n= 378\nArticles excluded with reasons\nInappropriate population                                        n=47\nData not extractable                                            n=48\nInappropriate outcome - n=10\nLack of original data i.e. reviews or letters                   n=9\nInappropriate test  \nCase control studies               \nn=33\nn=10\nTotal excluded                                                  n=157 Page 4 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medicine 2009, 7:10 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/7\/10Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admission\nNICU admission was assessed as an outcome in five stud-\nies [20,23,24,26]. The pooled positive and negative LRs\nfor cut-off level of 5 g\/24 h were 1.5 (95% CI 1, 2) and\n0.78 (955 CI 0.64, 0.95) and for levels of 10 g\/24 h, the\nLRs were 5.6 (95% CI 1.8, 17.4) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.69,\n0.87) respectively.\nDiscussion\nProteinuria has usually been associated with increase in\nmaternal and fetal mortality and morbidity [7]. Our\nreview has shown that the magnitude of proteinuria in\nwomen with pre-eclampsia is a poor predictor of the\nmajor maternal and fetal complications.\nFor prediction of adverse fetal outcomes, the only statisti-\ncally significant results were observed for positive test\nresult with LR+ ranging from 1.3 to 2.3 for cut-off levels of\n5 g\/24 h, 1+ and 3+ proteinuria in the prediction of still-\nbirths [20,21,23,30]. Furthermore, we need to take into\naccount that three of these five test accuracy studies were\nconducted more than 30 years ago [21,30]. The test was\nfound to be a poor predictor of neonatal and perinatal\ndeaths with no significant LRs for positive or negative test.\nThe test performed poorly as evidenced by the increase in\nadverse events noticed in the test negative group com-\npared with the test positive group, as noticed in some\nstudies [23,28,33]. The overall low value of abnormal test\nand high value of normal test implies that the test is of\n'very little' clinical value.\nThe validity of our review findings depends on the meth-\nodology of the systematic review and the quality of the\nindividual studies included [13]. An extensive literature\nsearch was performed in relevant databases without any\nlanguage restrictions to minimize the possibility of miss-\ning any studies. Methodological deficiencies such as veri-\nfication bias, differential use of reference standards and\ncase-control design did not apply to the studies in the\nreview, ensuring inclusion of studies of acceptable quality.\nThe methodological problems facing reviews of this\nnature are daunting. A significant limitation of this review\nis the heterogeneity noticed between individual studies\nwith regards to population, definition of pre-eclampsia,\nmethod of performing the test, test thresholds, frequency\nof testing, interval between the test and outcome, and ref-\nerence standards. The lack of information regarding the\ntemporal relation between test findings and outcomes\nobserved and possibility of confounding by other risk fac-\ntors contributing to maternal and fetal complications may\ninfluence the observed predictive value of proteinuria for\nmaternal and fetal complications. The wide confidence\nintervals observed for the various outcomes are a reflec-\ntion of the statistical uncertainty around the results due to\nthe small sample size in many studies. Meta-analysis of\nstudies using individual patient data may conquer many\nof the difficulties identified.\nConclusion\nThis systematic review has shown that estimation of levels\nof proteinuria in women with is not a clinically useful test\nto predict fetal or maternal complications. The results of\nthis review calls into question the commonly used prac-\ntice of making clinical decisions in women with pre-\neclampsia based on the severity of proteinuria.
