To\nour knowledge, all the techniques for designing the\ndispersion map of a DM system that have appeared\nso far in the literature rely on numerical procedures.\nIn particular, the parameters of the stationary pulses\n(fixed point) for a given DM line are commonly ob-\ntained either by repeated solution of the nonlinear\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation (NLSE) that describes the line\nor by solution of variational equations that correspond\nto the NLSE. Those numerical techniques for design-\ning the dispersion map exhibit two major drawbacks.\nFirst, they are generally much too time consuming.\nIn fact, the number of calculations required for obtain-\ning a stationary pulse varies substantially, depending\non the particular DM line under consideration. The\ngeneral numerical procedure for finding a fixed point\nis to start with some arbitrary solution and achieve\nstationary propagation by periodically averaging\nout the pulse f ields. But there is no guarantee of\nobtaining a stationary solution that corresponds to the\ndesired pulse width and energy. Here lies the second\ndrawback of the numerical procedure for designing a\ndispersion map of a DM fiber system. In this Letter\nwe present a fully analytical procedure for designing\na DM fiber system for any desired pulse and fiber\nparameters.\nThe pulse dynamics in DM fibers is governed by the\nNLSE:\ncz 1\nib\u0001z\u0002\n2\nctt 2 igjcj2c \u0001 0 , (1)\nwhere c is the slowly varying envelope of the axial\nelectrical f ield and b\u0001z\u0002 and g represent the group-\nvelocity dispersion and self-phase modulation parame-\nters, respectively. First we consider the design of a0146-9592\/01\/201544-03$15.00\/0DM fiber system without losses. In our analytical de-\nsign the f iber dispersion values are denoted b1 (nor-\nmal) and b2 (anomalous). The input pulse width at\nthe midpoint of the anomalous f iber \u0001x32\u0002, the energy\n\u0001E0\u0002, and the maximum pulse width \u0001x3m\u0002 are the ini-\ntial data required for deriving the lengths of anoma-\nlous \u0001L2\u0002 and normal \u0001L1\u0002 f ibers for periodic evolution\nof the DM solitons. It is a well-known fact that the\nGaussian ansatz provides an approximate but highly\naccurate representation of a DM soliton profile in a\nlarge parameter range including most practical situ-\nations. If we assume that the solution of the NLSE\n[Eq. (1)] is in the form of a Gaussian ansatz:\ncg \u0001 x1 exp\u00032j2\u0004x32 1 ix4j2\u00042 1 ix5j 1 ix6\u0005 , (2)\nwhere j \u0001 t 2 x2 and x1, x2,\np\n2 ln 2x3, x4\u0004\u00012p\u0002,\nx5\u0004\u00012p\u0002, and x6 represent the pulse amplitude, tem-\nporal position, width (FWHM), chirp, frequency, and\nphase, respectively, then, by using the variational\nmethod, we derive the equations for the pulse width\nand chirp as\n\u0002x3 \u0001 2b\u0001z\u0002x3x4 , (3a)\n\u0002x4 \u0001 b\u0001z\u0002 \u0001x42 2 4x324\u0002 2\np\n2gE0x323 . (3b)\nHere E0 \u0001 x12x3 is a constant that represents the en-\nergy of the Gaussian pulse. Taking the derivative of\nEq. (3a) with respect to z and using Eq. (3b), we derive\nthe equation for pulse duration as\nx\u00a83 \u0001 4b\u0001z\u00022x323 1\np\n2b\u0001z\u0002gE0x322. (4)\nIntegrating Eq. (4) with respect to x3, we get\n\u0002x32\u00042 \u0001 22b\u0001z\u00022x322 2\np\n2b\u0001z\u0002gE0x321 1 c . (5)\nThe constant of integration, c, can be different for\nnormal \u0001c1\u0002 and anomalous \u0001c2\u0002 f iber sections of the\u00a9 2001 Optical Society of America\nOctober 15, 2001 \/ Vol. 26, No. 20 \/ OPTICS LETTERS 1545dispersion map. c6 can be evaluated directly at the\nmidpoint of each section of the fiber where the pulse\nduration reaches its minimum as\nc6 \u0001 2b62x3622 1\np\n2b6gE0x3621. (6)\nGrigoryan et al. considered a similar kind of con-\nstant at the f iber junctions and used numerical tech-\nniques to describe the dependence of DM soliton energy\non the average dispersion.2 Chen and Haus derived\nthe same equations for the constants c6.3 Here we\nderive the equation that relates these constants \u0001c6\u0002\nto the maximum pulse width. For that we derive the\nexpression for the maximum pulse width \u0001x3m\u0002 from\nthe continuity of chirp when the DM soliton propagates\nfrom one fiber section to another f iber section. Then,\nat the f iber junctions from Eq. (3a), we have\n\u0002x32\nb2x32\n\u00c7\nx3m\n\u0001\n\u0002x31\nb1x31\n\u00c7\nx3m\n. (7)\nFrom Eqs. (5) and (7) we obtain the following expres-\nsion for the maximum pulse width:\nx3m \u0001\np\n2gE0b1b2\u0001b2 2 b1\u0002\u0004\u0001c1b22 2 c2b12\u0002 . (8)\nTo derive the expression for the length of the fiber\nsections, we must integrate Eq. (5) with respect to z.\nThen we find the length of normal \u0001L1\u0002 and anomalous\n\u0001L2\u0002 f iber sections:\nL6\n2\n\u0001 f \u0001b6, c6,x3m\u0002 2\ngb6E0\n2c6\np\nc6\nln\u00014c6x36\n2 2\np\n2gb6E0\u0002 , (9)\nwhere f \u0001b6, c6, x3\u0002 \u0001 \u0003R6\u0001x3\u0002\u00051\u00042\u00042c6 1 gb6E0\u00042c6 3p\nc6 ln\u00062\u00032c6R6\u0001x3\u0002\u00051\u00042 1 4c6x3 2 2\np\n2gb6E0\u0007, with\nR6\u0001x3\u0002\u0001 2c6x322 2\np\n2b6gE0x32 4b62. Thus, using\nthe data x32, E0, b6, and g, we can calculate the con-\nstant c2 from Eq. (6). Then, using the value of x3m\nand c2, we can calculate the other constant, c1, from\nEq. (8). After that the value of x31 can be directly\nobtained from Eq. (6). Then, using Eq. (9), we can\nstraightforwardly evaluate the lengths of the normal\nand anomalous f iber sections. We verif ied this ana-\nlytical design for lossless DM fiber lines and found that\nit works extremely well, as a Gaussian ansatz well de-\nscribes the single DM soliton dynamics.4 The main\nvirtue of this analytical approach is that one can de-\nsign the DM system to correspond to any desired pulse\nwith energy E0 and width x32. A second advantage\nis that the amount of calculations required for the an-\nalytical design represents an extremely small fraction\nof the amount of calculations one needs to obtain the\nfixed point directly from a pseudodynamic relaxation\nby using variational equations (3).\nTo illustrate the analytical design procedure, we\ntake the following input data: initial pulse width,\nx32 \u0001 10 ps; maximum pulse width, x3m \u0001 16.63 ps; en-\nergy, E0 \u0001 0.2 pJ; dispersion, b6 \u0001 66.8 ps2\u0004km; and\nKerr coeff icient, g \u0001 0.0014 mW21. From Eqs. (6),(8), and (9) we directly obtain L2\u00042 \u0001 10.6633 km\nand L1\u00042 \u0001 9.3367 km. Figure 1 shows the closed\nloop formed from the plot of the pulse width relative\nto chirp obtained from propagation of the initially\nassumed Gaussian pulse in the analytically designed\ndispersion map. A useful aspect of this analytical\ndesign is that it can be exploited to yield the proximity\nfixed point for a DM system in the presence of losses\nand gain, where a proximity f ixed point is defined as\nthe Gaussian pulse that will propagate without any\nradiation and during propagation will periodically\nreturn to the initial pulse width and chirp after a\ncertain number of dispersion maps. The ideal f ixed\npoint, however, will have the same width and a chirp\nafter each dispersion map.\nFor the analytical design with optical losses it is\nworth recalling that, because of the fiber losses, the\nfixed point of a symmetric map has some initial chirp.\nThis initial chirp, after a small distance of propaga-\ntion, say, d, will become zero. One can cut this length\nof fiber d from the first section of the symmetric map\nand merge it at the end of the map. So the resultant\nmap will be a modif ied symmetric map, whose f ixed\npoint will initially be unchirped.5 In what follows, we\nshow that our analytical design results in a similar\nkind of modified symmetric map for a system with\nlosses and gain. Let us first consider the analytical\ndesign of a DM fiber line in a particular case for\nwhich there is only one map in each amplif ication\nperiod. As a first step in the analytical design\nof this system with losses, by using the above analyti-\ncal procedure we derive the fiber lengths \u0001L6\u0002 of a\nsymmetric map without losses. We split that sym-\nmetric map into two asymmetric maps with equal total\nlengths L \u0001 \u0001L1 1 L2\u0002\u00042. We assume that energy\nE0 is almost constant in the f irst asymmetric map.\nBecause of the optical losses, the energy available\nat the input of the second asymmetric map will be\nE0 exp\u00012aL\u0002, where a is a loss parameter of both\ntypes of fiber. So we derive the new fiber lengths\nL60\u00042 for the second asymmetric map with the same\nFig. 1. Pulse width versus chirp obtained from the propa-\ngation of an initially assumed Gaussian pulse in the ana-\nlytically design map without losses.\n1546 OPTICS LETTERS \/ Vol. 26, No. 20 \/ October 15, 2001Fig. 2.

Then simply merging\nthe two asymmetrical maps gives the analytical\ndesign procedure for the modif ied symmetric map\nwith periodic losses and amplification. Hence the\nfinal design may have L2\u00042 length of anomalous fiber\nfollowed by L1\u00042 1 L10\u00042 length of normal fiber and\nfinally L2 0\u00042 length of anomalous f iber. Figure 2\nshows a schematic diagram of the analytically de-\nsigned dispersion map. For analytically designing\nDM fiber lines with more than one periodic dispersion\nmap in one amplif ication, we consider that the energy\nwithin every dispersion map is a constant. Energy\nis considered to be stepwise exponentially decreasing\nfrom one map to the other. So we can calculate the\nlengths of anomalous and normal fiber sections of\nindividual dispersion maps by using the same initialdata, except for the energy. We also find that the\nGaussian pulse with initial data (width x32 and\nenergy E0) propagates as a proximity fixed point in\nthe analytically designed DM fiber lines with losses\nand gain. When we average6 the DM soliton f ields\nobtained from the slow dynamics of the proximity\nGaussian fixed point, we immediately obtain the\nfixed point for the periodically amplif ied DM fiber\nsystem with losses. A fundamental property of this\nanalytical design is that the proximity fixed point gets\ncloser to the exact fixed point as the number of maps\nwithin an amplif ication period increases.\nTo demonstrate the procedure for analytical design\nof a DM fiber system with losses and gain, we con-\nsider a system with one dispersion map in one amplifi-\ncation period. For that, we consider the same input\ndata as in the above design of a lossless DM fiber\nsystem and a loss parameter (for both normal and\nanomalous f ibers) a \u0001 0.2 dB\u0004km. From our analyti-\ncal procedure we have the f iber lengths of two\nasymmetric maps as L2\u00042 \u0001 10.6633 km, L1\u00042 \u0001\n9.3367 km, L20\u00042\u0001 10.098 km, and L10\u00042\u0001 9.632 km.\nHence the amplif ication period length becomes \u0001L2\u0004\n2 1 L1\u00042 1 L10\u00042 1 L20\u00042\u0002 39.73 km. Figure 3\nshows the evolution of the proximity Gaussian fixed\npoint and the f ixed point (obtained from averaging6 the\nDM soliton f ields of the slow dynamics of the proximity\nfixed point) for 6000 km in the analytically designed\nmodified symmetric map with losses and gain.\nIn conclusion, we have presented a fully analytical\nmethod for designing DM fiber systems. By this ana-\nlytical procedure one can easily and efficiently design\nDM fiber transmission lines with periodic losses and\ngain for any desired pulse parameters.\nThis study has been carried out under contract\nURP\/4.00 between the University of Burgundy and\nthe Alcatel Research Corporation (URP\/C\/01\/0146).\nWe gratefully acknowledge partial support of this\nresearch from the Minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Education Nationale\nde la Recherche et de la Technologies (contract ACI\nJeunes 2015).
