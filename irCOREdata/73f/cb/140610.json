Wind tunnel experiments conducted on the surface of static\nwindrows generated specific bioaerosol emission rates (SBER2s) at ground level of\nbetween 13 - 22 x103 cfu\/m2\/s for mesophilic actinomycetes and between 8 - 11 x103\ncfu\/m2\/s for Aspergillus fumigatus. Air dispersion modelling of these emissions using the\nSCREEN3 air dispersion model in area source term mode was used to generate source\ndepletion curves downwind of the facility for comparative purposes.\n1 Introduction\nThe operation of composting facilities in the vicinity of residential and public places has\ngenerated concerns over the potential impacts these facilities may pose to public health.\nFugitive dusts emitted during waste decomposition releases a variety of bioaerosols\n(Fischer et al., 1999). In addition, the shredding of waste and the agitation and turning\nof compost during processing results in significant episodic releases to air. Bioaerosol\nparticles are airborne organisms or biological agents that may act as toxicants. They\ninclude allergens such as bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, arthopods, protozoa as well as\nmicrobial products such as endotoxin, microbial enzymes, \u03b2-1,3-glucans and mycotoxins\n(Millner et al., 1994). As a result of public health concerns and a need for operators to\ndemonstrate the safe and responsible operation of these facilities, environmental\nregulators are now requesting risk assessments of operators prior to licensing\ncomposting plants. The estimation of bioaerosol exposures to downwind receptors is\nbecoming important for large scale facilities sited in sensitive environmental settings\nclose to the public.\nUnderstanding the baseline emission of bioaerosols at source, and the factors and\nprocess variables that influence their generation and off-site dispersal is critical to\nmeaningful risk assessment. Bioaerosol emission rate and dispersal are influenced by a\nlarge number of factors, including the materials being composted, the on-site processes\ninvolved, the associated vehicle movements, the process equipment used, individual\nbioaerosol properties and the geographical, topographical and meteorological conditions\non- and off-site. This is a complex set of variables and in our research we have set out\nto understand one aspect alone; the baseline fugitive emissions and the influence of\ncomposting processing variables on bioaerosol flux at source.\nThis paper presents the initial results of a study on estimating fugitive emissions at\nsource. We use a portable wind tunnel to capture bioaerosols above compost windrows\nin the absence of turning. The data generated provides a baseline assessment of\n2fugitive emissions and has been used as input to an air dispersion model (SCREEN3)\nfor assessing potential dispersal off-site under static conditions. Subsequent work will\nexamine the influence of process variables on episodic bioaerosol flux from a range of\non-site unit processes.\n2 Material and Methods\nThe experimental and methodological rationale is summarised in Figure 1. Bioaerosol\nflux measurements were conducted at a green waste, open windrow composting facility\nin the SE of England where waste unloading, shredding, turning activities were\nconcurrent. Fugitive emission rates were estimated from wind tunnel experiments and\nused to generate hypothetical source depletion curves at distance from the facility.\n2.1 Wind tunnel measurements and control\nA portable wind tunnel [Figure 2] was located on top of compost windrows to allow the\nmeasurement of bioaerosol emission flux under static conditions. The fugitive dust\nemitted from the surface area was sampled within the horizontal air stream of the wind\ntunnel at a known velocity (ca. 3 m\/s) across the surface. In the tunnel, incoming air is\nfiltered by activated carbon and blown into the inlet duct with a fan. A convective mass\ntransfer takes place above the emitting surface and bioaerosols are then mixed into the\nbulk of the carrier air and vented from the hood. The base of the wind tunnel was\nembedded ca. 25 mm inside the surface of the pile to ensure no loss of air volume\naround the sides. Samples were taken from the hood outlet and the air flow velocity\nmeasured using a hot wire anemometer (Kestral 3000). Three compost pile locations\nwere selected on the basis of access and suitability (the availability of power supply and\nof a flat surface). Ambient (i.e. on-site background) air bioaerosol concentrations were\nmeasured at 1.8m height close to the compost windrow, downwind of the pile. A filled\nfilter cassette was exposed without air pumping as a field blank.\n2.2 Bioaerosol sampling\nBioaerosols were sampled using a medium flow personal aerosol filter sampler (SKC\nUniversal dust and vapour sampling pump). Pumps were operated at 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 l\/min and\nfitted with SKC dust sampling IOM heads (25mm) loaded with mixed cellulose ester\nfilters (25 mm x 0.8 \u03bcm pore size). Sampling took place for ca. 30 min. As a control, a\nsample was taken directly from the outlet of activated carbon filter to measure the quality\nof the cleaned the inlet air supply. Microorganisms were quantified by using CAMNEA-\nmethod (Collection of airborne microorganisms on Nuclepore filters, Estimation and\nAnalysis; Palmgren et al. (1986)). After sampling, filters were placed inside a 30ml vial\ncontaining 10ml 0.05%v\/v Tween-80 mixed with 0.1%w\/w NaCl to prevent cell osmosis.\nOn return to the laboratory, bioaerosols were re-suspended and cultured on to nutrient\nplates.\n2.3 Bioaerosol enumeration\nAspergillus fumigatus (average size of 2-50\u03bcm) and mesophilic actinomycetes (average\nsize of 1\u03bcm) were enumerated by visual inspection. Media preparation, inoculation,\ndilution and sterilisation were performed in accordance with BS 5763: Part 0. For\nmesophilic actinomycetes, two media were used and developed simultaneously: (i) half\nstrength nutrient agar (Oxoid); and (ii) soil compost agar (a supernatant of 10%w\/w of\n3loam-based compost John Innes No. 1 compost in agar). After preparation, both media\nwere autoclaved (105\u00b0C, 15 minutes), left to cool to below 47\u00b0C and then treated with\n1%v\/v antifungal cycloheximide. For Aspergillus fumigatus, malt extract agar (Merck)\nwas mixed with 0.01%w\/w of antibacterial chloramphenicol (Sigma). Nutrient agar\nplates and soil compost agar plates were incubated at 440C. Malt extract agar plates\nwere incubated at 37\u00b0C. Colonies growing on both media were enumerated visually\nafter 3 to 7 days.\n2.4 Estimating the fugitive bioaerosol emission rate\nBioaerosols concentrations for the ambient air sample, the filtered input air and wind\ntunnel outlet air at locations 1 and 3 are presented in Table 1. Wind tunnel 2 data was\ninvalidated due to pump malfunction. The net bioaerosol concentrations in the wind\ntunnel were estimated by subtracting the inlet concentrations from the measured data at\nthe outlet. The air velocity inside the wind tunnel is calculated from:\nV1 = V2xA2\/A1 [1]\nwhere:\nV1 and A1 = air velocity (m\/s) and area (m2) of the main section of wind tunnel; and\nV2 and A2 = air velocity (m\/s) and area (m2) of the mixing chamber, where sampling is\ncarried out.\nThe specific bioaerosol emission rate (SBER) is the quantity of bioaerosol emitted per\nunit time from a unit surface. The equation is adopted from that used to determine the\nspecific odour emission rate (Jiang et al. 2001) from surfaces and for this initial\nassessment, an assumption was made that bioaerosols exhibit gaseous-like properties:\nA\nQxBC\nSBER \uf03d [2]\nwhere:\nSBER= specific bioaerosol emission rate (cfu\/m2\/s);\nQ = flow rate through the wind tunnel (m3\/s);\nBC = bioaerosol concentration in air (cfu\/m3); and\nA= area covered by the wind tunnel (m2)\nBioaerosol concentrations measured in the mixing chamber were taken as an average of\nthose measured at the top and the bottom of the chamber. The specific bioaerosol\nemission rate corresponding to actual ground level wind speeds, as opposed to those in\nthe chamber, is then estimated using:\n5.0\n1\n2\n12 \uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf0b4\uf03d\nV\nV\nSBERSBER [3]\nwhere:\nSBER1= specific bioaerosol emission rate measured using the wind tunnel (cfu\/m2\/s);\nSBER2= specific bioaerosol emission rate corresponding to ground level wind velocity\n(cfu\/m2\/s);\nV1= air velocity inside wind tunnel for sample collection; and\nV2= actual ground level wind velocity (m\/s)\n42.5 Estimating bioaerosol dispersal\nBioaerosol concentrations downwind of the facility were estimated using SCREEN3 in\narea source term mode, a source area of 20m x 80m, an emission height of 2 m and a\nmoderate sky insulation setting. The power-law equation was used to determine the\nvelocity at 10m height to select the Pasquill stability categories and inputs to SCREEN3.\nPower-law: Paaz zzuu )\/(\uf03d [4]\nWhere uz= wind velocity (m\/s) at a vertical height z above ground;\nUa= wind velocity (m\/s) at the anemometer height;\nz = vertical height above ground (1.8m);\nza = anemometer height above ground (10m); and\np = exponent dependent on stability; 0.07 (unitless) for unstable.\n3. Results and discussion\nBioaerosol release, like fugitive dust emission, is dependent upon on particle size,\nsurface loading, surface conditions, wind speeds, atmospheric and surface moisture and\nthe presence of dust suspending activities. Watson et al. (2000) suggest that wind\nspeeds of more than 0.19 m\/s have the capacity to elevate loose dust particles and\ntransport them for long distances. The dispersal of bioaerosol is subject to physical,\nmeteorological and operational considerations. Meteorological characteristics at a site,\nin conjunction with topography, will affect bioaerosol exposures to workers and the\nnearby public. Wind conditions and the height of the location or point of release of the\nfacility determine the diffusion and distribution of bioaerosols over a spatial area and so\nwhere the intent is to maintain the mass of airborne material close to the facility, then\ncomposting facilities should be shielded from wind and preferably emit aerosols at low\nheights, or at elevations below surrounding sensitive areas. Diffusion models can be\nused to estimate the impact of composting emissions on sensitive receptors, but at\npresent, only limited data are available to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of\nprocess operational characteristics on the bioaerosol emission flux.\nThe measured bioaerosol data and estimated specific bioaerosol emission rates\n(SBER2s) for the fugitive release of mesophilic actinomycetes and Aspergillus fumigatus\nin this study are presented in Table 1. Air dispersion modelling estimates at distances\ndownwind of the facility are presented in Table 2. Caution must be exercised in\ninterpreting bioaerosol data. There are several important sources of analytical and\nmethodological uncertainty in quantifying these agents and wind tunnel experiments may\nadd an additional source of model artefact to the analysis. Nevertheless, these initial\ndata do allow quantification of fugitive bioaerosol release at source above static compost\nwindrows and an estimation of source depletion with distance for comparison with other\nliterature studies.\nThese data must be interpreted in the context of their acquisition. Data were acquired\nduring normal operations in which waste unloading, shredding, windrow piling and\nturning were concurrent. We were unable to interrupt normal operations during the\nsampling period to specifically disaggregate ambient contributions from windrows from\nassociated activities at the site.\n5Wheeler et al. (2001) has suggested that the best available estimates for threshold limit\nvalues (background) for gram-negative bacteria, total bacteria and fungi in air are 300,\n1000 and 1000 cfu\/m3 respectively though the scientific consensus is limited. Some\nbioaerosol risk assessments have used low (5000 cfu\/m3), medium (10 000 cfu\/m3) and\nhigh (30 000 cfu\/m3) estimates of bioaerosol concentrations at proposed or existing\nfacilities to represent source data for onward dispersion modelling. In this context, the\nambient air concentrations of A. fumigatus (77000 cfu\/m3) and mesophilic actinomycetes\n(10300 cfu\/m3) measured in this study are high. Net fugitive bioaerosol data [Table 1] for\nwindrow samples 1 and 3 samples in the wind tunnel outlet are of a similar order of\nmagnitude, though lower than this ambient sample for A. fumigatus and higher for\nactinomycetes. In practice, large variations are associated with ambient bioaerosol\nmonitoring data; for example on previous occasions at this facility, ambient A. fumigatus\nconcentrations of 120 x 103 cfu\/m3 and 22 x 103 cfu\/m3 (c.f. 77 x 103 cfu\/m3) have been\nmeasured using an identical filter sampler technique. A further issue relates to the\nobservation (Wheeler et al., 2001) that bioaerosol data collected using Anderson\nsamplers frequently report an order of magnitude less than those collected using filter\nsamplers. Irrespective, it is clear from our study that there are contributions to the site\nbioaerosol load beyond fugitive emissions from static windrows, as one would expect.\nFor the wind tunnel bioaerosol data, activated carbon influent air is demonstrably\n\u2018cleaned\u2019 by comparison with the ambient background sample, these data suggesting\nadsorption efficiencies of 99%w\/w and 92%w\/w for A. fumigatus and actinomycetes,\nrespectively. For the outlet data, fair agreement is demonstrated between locations 1\nand 2 [Table 1] (with location 2 providing a greater flux for both determinands)\nsuggesting less variability for consecutive wind tunnel experiments on material from a\ncommon source. Transformation of the concentration data provide fugitive specific\nbioaerosol emission rates (SBER2s) at ground level of between 13 - 22 x103 cfu\/m2\/s for\nmesophilic actinomycetes and between 8 - 11 x103 cfu\/m2\/s for Aspergillus fumigatus.\nThese rates are used as the area source emission input data for the air dispersion\nmodelling of these emissions using the SCREEN3 air dispersion model to generate\nsource depletion curves downwind of the facility for comparative purposes [Table 2].\nThe modelled A. fumigatus source depletion curves for these data using the area source\nterm emission rates generated in wind tunnel experiments are shown in Figure 3,\nalongside literature data acquired by environmental sampling at distance from\ncomposting facilities (Figure 4; wind tunnel data removed). Figure 3 mixes modelled and\nmonitored data and studies from a range of facilities. These studies are not directly\ncomparable and used for illustrative purposes alone. Two observations are worthy of\nmerit however, notwithstanding the additional difficulties and artificial nature of using\nGaussian distribution models for bioaerosol dispersion. Comparing Figures 3 and 4, one\nnotices the rapid depletion of bioaerosol concentrations from source in both monitored\nand modelled data. Further, source depletion to proposed background values of 1000\ncfu\/m3 typically occurs between 250-500m from source in the wind tunnel data and\ntypically within 250m for the monitoring studies. We propose that the data generated by\nour study are generally consistent with literature data. For example, for A fumigatus and\nmesophilic actinomycetes, Sanches-Monedero and Stentiford (2003) have recently\nreported that at up to 40m from composting sites the concentrations of these bioaerosols\nare between 3.8x103 and 98x103 cfu\/m3 and between 23 x103 and 110 x103 cfu\/m3 ,\nrespectively.\n64 Conclusions\nWe have presented initial data from a wind tunnel experiment demonstrating the ability\nto measure the fugitive emission flux of bioaerosols from static windrows. We conclude:\n\uf0b7 wind tunnels can be used to measure the emission flux of fugitive bioaerosol that\nare aerosolized by wind energy;\n\uf0b7 the emission fluxes estimated can be used within the SCREEN3 air dispersal\nmodel for estimating bioaerosol concentrations downwind of composting facilities;\n\uf0b7 these data and the bioaerosol characteristics they help illustrate are important for\nenvironmental risk assessment that support the licensing of larger composting\nplants in sensitive locations;\n\uf0b7 our methodology forms the basis for estimating specific bioaerosol emission\nrates from other activities, including shredding, screening, turning, vehicles\nmovement, loading and waste unloading;\n\uf0b7 future work will focus on improving the measurement and analysis of bioaerosols\nduring compost processing.\nAcknowledgements\nWe wish to gratefully acknowledge the technical support of Dr Martin Lowe, Visiting\nFellow, Integrated Waste Management Centre, R.
