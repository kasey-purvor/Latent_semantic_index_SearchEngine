INTRODUCTION \nDigital watermarking is the art of protecting the multimedia \ndata by inserting the proprietary mark which may be easily \nretrieved by the owner of the data to verify about its \nownership or authenticity. A variety of digital watermarking \nmethods have been developed for such purposes [1, 2]. For \ncertain applications, watermarks for checking the authenticity \nof the multimedia data should be fragile because any \ncorruption to watermarked data easily destroy the watermark \nand so the detection algorithm will be able to verify the \nintegrity of the data being tested. Provable security of digital \nmedia can be guaranteed through the use of cryptographic \nsignatures as the fragile watermark. Cryptographic signature \nhas been well studied in cryptography and algorithms such as \nDSA, RSA and MD5 are extensively used in various \nauthentication applications [3]. In authentication \nwatermarking, the advantage of having the cryptographic \nsignature hidden inside the digital data rather than appended \nto it is obvious. Lossless format conversion of the \nwatermarked data does not render it inauthentic though the \nrepresentation of the data is changed. Another advantage is \nthat if the authentication information is localized, it is then \npossible to achieve the capability to localize the \nmodifications after tampering by a hostile attacker. The \npresent work involves watermarking in binary document \nimages that could potentially include digitized versions of \ntext, circuit diagrams, signature, driver licenses, financial and \nlegal documents. By using different imaging software tools, \nthe reproduction, distribution and editing of such images \nbecome easier. As such the ownership protection, \nauthentication and annotation of binary images as well as \ntamper proofing have become necessary and important. \nSeveral watermarking methods in binary images have been \nproposed in literature.  \n \nLow et al [4, 5] proposed robust data hiding methods in \nformatted document images based on imperceptible line and \nword shifting. Their methods were applied to hide \ninformation in text images for bulk electronic publications. \nThe line shifting method has low data hiding capacity as \ncompared to the word shifting method but the hidden data is \nmore robust to photocopying, scanning and printing process. \nBrassil et al proposed a scheme in [6], where the height of the \nbounding box enclosing a group of words could be used to \nhide data. This method has a better data hiding capacity than \nline and word shifting methods. Wu et al [7] hid data in a \nbinary image using a hierarchical model in which human \nperception was taken into consideration. Distortion that \noccurred due to flipping of a pixel was measured by \nconsidering the change in smoothness and connectivity of a \n3x3 window centered at the pixel. A single data bit is \nembedded in each block by modifying its total number of \nblack pixels to be either odd or even. Shuffling was used to \nequalize the uneven embedding capacity over the image. \nKoch and Zhao [8] proposed a data hiding algorithm in which \na data bit \u20181\u2019 is embedded if the percentage of white pixels \nwas greater than a given threshold, and a data bit \u20180\u2019 is \nembedded if the percentage of white pixels was less than \nanother given threshold. A sequence of contiguous or \ndistributed blocks was modified by flipping the pixels until a \ncertain threshold was reached. This algorithm was not robust \n3930-7803-9314-7\/05\/$20.00\u00a92005 IEEE\n2005 IEEE International \nSymposium on Signal Processing\nand Information Technology\nto attacks and the hiding capacity was low. Our present work \naddresses the issue of secure authentication watermarking for \nbinary images in electronic form in conjunction with \ncryptography techniques. Incorporating cryptography makes \nit possible to design a provably secure authentication \nwatermarking scheme. Watermarking schemes for secure \nauthentication applications need high capacity. Hiding \nconsiderable amount of data in binary images is a difficult \nproblem, because minor modification can be relatively \nperceptible since the pixels are either black or white. A \nperceptual based CWDD model was proposed in [9] to \nminimize the visual distortion in the watermarked images. \nThrough subjective experiments the CWDD model was found \nto be highly correlated with the human perception in \nestimating distortion due to the flipping of a pixel. By using \nthis model it was possible to select suitable contour pixels for \nwatermark embedding in binary images. The paper is \norganized as follows: in Section II, the motivation for \nproposing a new authentication watermarking algorithm in \nbinary images is discussed. The proposed authentication \nwatermarking algorithm is described in Section III for \nachieving provable security against any content modification. \nResults and discussion are presented in Section IV and finally \nsome conclusions are given in Section V. \nII. MOTIVATION \nIn this section, the motivation in proposing a new algorithm \nfor authentication watermarking is discussed. Various \nauthentication watermarking methods have been proposed for \ngrayscale images in [10, 11]. However, there are only a \nlimited number of authentication watermarking methods \navailable for binary images. In a typical cryptography-based \nauthentication watermarking method, an authentication \nsignature (either message authentication code or digital \nsignature) is computed from the whole image and embedded \ninto the image itself. However, the very process of \nembedding a watermark alters the image, causing the \nsubsequent authentication test to fail. To prevent this, it is \nusually necessary to partition the image into two parts, one of \nwhich is to be authenticated and the other to be altered to \naccommodate a watermark. A simple example is to partition \nan image such that the least-significant-bit (LSB) plane holds \nthe authentication signature computed from the remaining \nbits of the image. However this idea does not work directly \nfor binary images, because each pixel has only one bit. By \nmodifying any pixel to embed a watermark would affect the \nsignature of the image and the authentication test would fail. \nThe challenging problem is how to divide the binary image \ninto two parts such that the above idea of embedding the \nauthentication signature can be applied. Cryptography-based \nauthentication watermarking schemes were proposed for \nbinary images in [12, 13]. Kim et al modified few bits in a \nbinary image for embedding the authentication signature and \nthe positions of those bits were known in both embedding and \ndetection processes [12]. However this method of simple \npartitioning the binary image results in poor visual quality. In \n[13], Kim et al shuffled the binary image and then partitioned \nthe shuffled image into two equal parts. Authentication \nsignature was computed from one part and then embedded \ninto the other part using the block-wise data hiding technique \ndeveloped in [7]. A block in the second part of the image was \nembedded one bit of the authentication signature by \nmodifying its total number of black pixels to be either odd or \neven. In this method, the first part is provably secure because \nthe probability of undetected modification in this part is only \n2 n\u2212  where n is the length of the authentication signature. \nHowever the second part of the image which carries the \nsignature is prone to a \u2018parity attack\u2019. The parity attack arises \nbecause the signature is embedded in the second part by \nconsidering the parity of the blocks, the number of black \npixels. If two pixels that belong to the same block in the \nsecond part of the image change their values, the parity of \nthis block may not change and so this modification will pass \nundetected. In Fig. 1 (a)\u2013(d), the possibility of a parity attack \nto the watermarked image generated using the block-wise \ndata hiding technique is illustrated. In the same paper, the \nproposed algorithm was modified to minimize the possibility \nof a parity attack. Thus each block in the second part of the \nimage would have different probabilities of suffering due to \nparity attack and without being detected. As such this method \nis not provably secure against any type of modification to the \nwatermarked image. In the next section, we propose a new \nauthentication watermarking algorithm such that any \nmodification in the watermarked image can be detected with \nhigh probability. The proposed algorithm achieves provable \nsecurity because, (1) the original image can be partitioned \ninto two parts by using the CWDD model and (2) the pixel-\nwise embedding of the authentication signature removes any \npossibility of parity attack. \nIII. PROPOSED AUTHENTICATION WATERMARKING \nALGORITHM \nIn this section, we shall propose a new algorithm for \nauthentication watermarking in binary images. After flipping \na contour pixel, the amount of visible distortion can be \nestimated by the change in the contour segment that passes \nthrough the pixel. To calculate the distortion score for a \ncontour pixel to be flipped, the 5-pixel length \u2018original \ncontour segment\u2019 passing through this pixel is extracted by \nthe contour tracing step [14]. Similarly after flipping the \npixel, the \u2018watermarked contour segment\u2019 is also extracted. \nAccording to Eq. (6) in [9], the computation of CWDD \nmeasure takes the original and watermarked contour \nsegments into account. The CWDD measure of a pixel \nremains the same before and after its flipping, because it is \ncomputed by considering the change occurred during the \nflipping process. This reversible property is particularly \nuseful in identifying an ordered set of pixels in the original \nimage. During watermarking each such pixel can carry one \nbit of the authentication signature computed from the \n394\nremaining pixels in the image. For blind detection, these \npixels should be detected in the same order as the embedder \nduring the watermarking process. However, direct application \nof the reversible property of the distortion measure is not \nsufficient alone for this purpose. Certain necessary conditions \nare designed for the correct detection of the ordered set of \npixels in the proposed algorithm. We define each such pixel \nas the reversible pixel in an image. If a set of reversible pixels \nare found, the original image can be divided into two parts as \nnecessary for correctly embedding the authentication \nsignature. Secondly, the pixel-wise embedding of the \nauthentication signature in the reversible pixels shall remove \nthe possibility of parity attack. The following steps explain \nthe proposed authentication watermarking algorithm in binary \nimages.  \n \nEmbedding: \n \n1. The CWDD measure for each contour pixel in the \noriginal image is computed. The contour pixels having \nthe distortion score below a threshold T are defined as \nthe suitable pixel and rest of the pixels in the image are \ndefined as non-suitable. The suitable pixels after flipping \nbring less visible distortion to the watermarked image \nand in the next step only these pixels are examined for \nwatermarking. \n2. Among the suitable pixels, N numbers of reversible \npixels that satisfy a set of conditions are searched in a \nsequential scanning order starting from left to right and \ntop to bottom of the original image. The conditions for a \nsuitable pixel to be defined as the reversible pixel are \ngiven below: \na. In an MxM pixel window centered on the current \nsuitable pixel, there should not be any reversible \npixel already found in the image.  \nb. If after flipping, it does not change the suitability \nstatus of any neighboring pixel which comes before \nit in the scanning order. A change in suitability \nstatus means that a suitable pixel is changed to a \nnon-suitable pixel and vice-versa after the flipping \nprocess. The neighborhood considered is a 5x5 pixel \nwindow centered on the current suitable pixel.  \nCondition (a) is necessary because flipping of the current \nsuitable pixel may cause a change in the status of the \nreversible pixels near to it. Condition (b) is necessary \nbecause any change in the suitable status of the neighbor \npixels coming before it in scanning order may lead to an \nerror in the blind detection. However, any change in the \nsuitability status of the pixels subsequently in the \nscanning order does not cause any error because of \ncondition (a). To verify any such change in their \nsuitability status, the CWDD measure for the neighbor \npixels is computed after flipping the center pixel. In Fig. \n2, the condition 2 (b) is shown as an example.  \n3. After N reversible pixels are found, all pixels in the \noriginal image are divided into two disjoint subsets. The \nreversible pixels form the reversible subset RS  and \nremaining pixels in the original image belong to the \nmessage subset MS . \n4. The authentication signature is computed from the pixels \nin MS using the secret key and embedded into the pixels \nof the reversible subset. The embedding is performed \npixel-wise; so each reversible pixel in RS  holds one bit \nof the authentication signature and the reversible pixel \nvalue is set equal to the signature bit it holds. \n5. Set union operation of the embedded reversible subset \nm\nRS  and the message subset MS  generates the \nwatermarked image.  \n \nDetection: \n \n6. Similar to the steps 1, 2 and 3 in the embedding process, \nN numbers of reversible pixels are searched in the test \nimage at the blind detector in sequential scanning order \nand all pixels in this image are divided into two disjoint \nsubsets. The reversible pixels form the reversible subset \n'\nRS  and remaining pixels in the test image belong to the \nmessage subset 'MS . \n7. The N-bit authentication signature is computed from the \npixels in 'MS using the secret key and compared with the \nN reversible pixel values of 'RS . If each signature bit \nmatches with the corresponding reversible pixel value, \nthen the image under question is authentic. Otherwise \nthis image has been modified after the watermarking \nprocess. \nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nIn this section, we present the simulation results by \nimplementing the authentication watermarking algorithm \nproposed in the previous section. The authentication signature \nto be used in this algorithm is the Hashed Message \nAuthentication Code (HMAC). The HMAC is found by \ncomputing the one way hash function of the data string that is \na concatenation of the pixel set and secret key. In our method, \nprovable security against any modification is obtained by \nusing the cryptographic hash function. In the implementation, \nwe have used MD5 [15] hash function to compute the HMAC \nand the output 128-bit HMAC is used as the authentication \nsignature. The original image of size 320x432 pixels in Fig. \n1(a) is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm \nagainst content modification. Here N is equal to 128 and a \ntotal of 128 reversible pixels are searched in the original \nimage by following the sequential scanning order. The \nthreshold parameter T for choosing the suitable pixel by the \nCWDD measure is 0.5 and the parameter M is chosen to be \n11 for keeping the reversible pixels separated by a distance. \nLow value of parameter T brings less visual distortion in \nwatermarked image and parameter M is chosen to be 11 to \n395\nsatisfy condition 2(a) for correct blind detection. The choice \nof higher M value reduces visual interference among the \nreversible (flipping) pixels being separated by a larger \ndistance. Thus visual quality of the watermarked image is less \naffected. However, the number of available reversible pixels \nis reduced with the increase in M value. Fig. 3 shows the \nwatermarked image after embedding the 128-bit HMAC \nwhich is perceptually similar to the original image. In Fig. 4, \n128 reversible pixel positions in the original and watermarked \nimage are shown to be identical. Since the position map of \nthe reversible pixels in both the images is identical, correct \nblind detection is possible after the watermarking process. In \nour simulation, a maximum of 584 reversible pixels are found \nin both the images using the chosen parameters. We perform \nmultiple modifications such as deletion, insertion and \nsubstitution of characters in the watermarked image; (1) the \nonly word \u2018information.\u2019 in last line is deleted, (2) the word \n\u2018theory\u2019 is inserted in the last line, and (3) the word \u2018for\u2019 in \nline-5 is substituted by the word \u2018to\u2019. The resulting attacked \nimage is shown in Fig. 5 (a). At the detector side the attacked \nimage fails in the authentication test. In Fig. 5(b), difference \nbetween the HMAC computed from the message subset and \nthe reversible subset illustrate the failure of the attacked \nimage to pass the authenticity test.  \n \nThe performance of the proposed algorithm can be compared \nwith the previous three methods that also address the issue of \nauthentication watermarking in binary images [7, 12, 13]. \nThe method suggested by Wu et al in [7] detects the \nmodification by using a block-based data hiding technique \nafter shuffling the binary image. Though this method can \ndetect tampering, it suffers from the parity attack and here \nsecurity level is less as comparable to the authentication \nmethods that use the cryptographic signatures. In [12], Kim et \nal performs pixel-wise embedding of the cryptographic \nsignature, so their method is not vulnerable to parity attack \nand can detect any modification with high probability. \nHowever the visual quality of the watermarked image \nbecomes poor because necessary perceptual modeling is not \nperformed. In [13], Kim et al proposes a method to detect any \nmodification in binary images by embedding the \ncryptographic signature block-wise. As discussed earlier this \nis also vulnerable to parity attack but the visual quality is not \nreduced after watermarking. The security of the proposed \nauthentication algorithm can be directly related to a secure \ncryptographic element such as a hash function. The \nprobability of any undetected modification in the \nwatermarked image is only 2 n\u2212  where n is the length of the \nauthentication signature being used. If the attacker wants to \nmodify the message subset such that the authentication \nsignature remains same, the chances of obtaining such a \ncollision are removed by using a secure cryptographic key of \nlength 128 bits or more. Further, if the attacker alters any \nsignature bearing reversible pixel, then the computed \nsignature from the message subset will not match with the \npixels in the reversible subset. Use of the CWDD measure \nensures the visual quality of the watermarked image remains \nperceptually similar to the original image. The possibility of \nparity attack is not present here because each bit of \nauthentication signature is carried by a reversible pixel \ninstead of a block. To summarize, the ability of the proposed \nauthentication algorithm for detecting any type of content \nmodification in the watermarked image is equivalent to the \nsecurity of cryptographic authentication without being \nsusceptible to any attacks. \nV. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we proposed a new authentication \nwatermarking algorithm for binary images. The proposed \nalgorithm can detect any kind of modification to the \nwatermarked image with probability equivalent to that of the \ncryptographic authentication. For this purpose, an ordered set \nof low-distortion reversible pixels are selected for pixel-wise \nembedding of the authentication signature. This selection of \nthe reversible pixels is performed by designing the necessary \nconditions and using the reversible property of CWDD \nmeasure. The proposed algorithm does not suffer from any \nparity attack like the other block-wise data hiding methods in \nbinary images. The application of the proposed algorithm for \nbinary images can be used in secure FAX transmission. After \na transmission is performed, the sending FAX machine \nembeds the watermark using its own secret-key. The receiver \nFax machine can verify the received document whether it has \nnot been modified after the transmission. Another application \ncould be the legal usage of binary documents. If documents \nare stored in a database, the user can verify their authenticity \nby using the appropriate key.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n396\n \n(a) \n \n \n \n(b) \n \n \n \n(c) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   (d) \n   \nFig. 1.
