We obtain sharp results for the genericity and stability of transitivity, ergodicity\nand mixing for compact connected Lie group extensions over a hyperbolic basic set of a\nC2 diffeomorphism. In contrast to previous work, our results hold for general hyperbolic\nbasic sets and are valid in the Cr -topology for all r > 0 (here r need not be an integer\nand C1 is replaced by Lipschitz). Moreover, when r \u2265 2, we show that there is a C2-open\nand Cr -dense subset of Cr -extensions that are ergodic.

Introduction\nIn this paper we consider the stable transitivity and ergodicity of Lie group extensions over\na hyperbolic basic set with a fixed base diffeomorphism. We also obtain stable transitivity\nand ergodicity results for suspension flows (fixed base map and varying roof function).\nElsewhere [11], we show how our methods can be developed to prove, for example,\nthat mixing hyperbolic flows are open and dense within the class of smooth non-trivial\nhyperbolic flows.\nAfter a survey of some of the existing results on extensions by compact Lie groups,\nwe describe in \u00a71.2 our new results on compact group andRm-extensions over a hyperbolic\nbasic set. In \u00a71.3, we describe our results on suspension flows. In \u00a71.4, we describe related\nresults in [11].\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n518 M. Field et al\n1.1. Compact group extensions of a fixed hyperbolic basic set. In this subsection,\nwe give a brief historical review of some of the previous work in this area that relates\nto our work.\nLet G be a compact connected Lie group. In 1975, Brin [9] proved the genericity\n(in the C2-topology) of stable ergodicity for compact Lie group extensions of Anosov\ndiffeomorphisms. Specifically, Brin showed that there was a C1-open and C1-dense set of\ntransitive compact Lie group extensions of an Anosov diffeomorphism [9, Theorem 2.2]\nand deduced (using [10, Theorem 5.3]) that every C2-transitive extension was Kolmogorov\nand, a fortiori, ergodic. More recently, using somewhat different methods, Adler\net al [1] re-proved a variant of Brin\u2019s result that applied to circle extensions of Anosov\ndiffeomorphisms of a torus. Specifically, they showed that there is a C0-open and\nC\u221e-dense set of extensions of such diffeomorphisms that are ergodic. (The same result\nholds for toral extensions of a hyperbolic attractor [14].) Following the result of Adler\net al [1], Parry and Pollicott [23] studied stability of mixing for toral extensions over\naperiodic subshifts of finite type and over connected hyperbolic basic sets subject to a\ncohomological restriction.\nField and Parry [14] generalized these results to allow for extensions by compact\nconnected non-Abelian Lie groups G. In the case that G is semisimple, they proved that for\nall \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) and \u221e \u2265 r \u2265 \u03b1, there is a C\u03b1-open, Cr -dense set of ergodic extensions over\na general hyperbolic basic set. In the case that the basic set is an attractor, they obtained\nthe same stability result for general compact connected Lie groups G. Extensions and\nvariations of the results in [14, 23] may be found in [12, 13].\nUnfortunately, the situation regarding toral extensions over general hyperbolic basic sets\nas reported in these works is less than satisfactory. Thus, in [23], the stability and density\nresult for extensions of a subshift of finite type is proved in the C\u03b1-topology, \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1),\nbut the open and dense set of ergodic C\u03b1-extensions contains no C\u03b2 -extensions, \u03b2 > \u03b1.\nA second issue is that the methods of [14, 23] require for toral extensions either that\nthe base is a subshift of finite type or that the base is connected and a cohomological\ncondition holds (the only examples known satisfying the cohomological condition are\nattractors\/repellors).\nIn the present paper, we resolve these problems and give sharp results for compact Lie\ngroup extensions of general hyperbolic basic sets. Although our emphasis here is on skew\n(product) extensions, all of our results apply to principal G-extensions (see [14, \u00a75.3]).\nOur results also apply to classes of partially hyperbolic G-invariant basic sets. For these\napplications, we refer to [12].\n1.2. Results on group extensions. We suppose throughout that \u0003 is a fixed\nC2-diffeomorphism of the compact manifold M , and that \u0004 is a hyperbolic basic set for \u0003.\nDefinition 1.1. We say that \u0004 is a hyperbolic basic set for the diffeomorphism \u0003 if \u0004 is a\nlocally maximal hyperbolic set, and \u0003|\u0004 is topologically transitive. In addition, we require\nthat the basic set \u0004 is non-trivial, meaning that it does not coincide with a periodic orbit.\nDefinition 1.2. For r > 0, we give the usual meaning to \u2018Cr \u2019 and the \u2018Cr -topology\u2019 except\nthat C1-maps will be defined as Lipschitz.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nStable ergodicity 519\nBy Cr(M,G) we denote the space of Cr -cocycles on M with the Cr -topology.\nTHEOREM 1.3. For r > 0, there exists a Cr -open and -dense subset Wr of Cr(M,G)\nsuch that for all f \u2208 Wr , the skew extension \u0003f : \u0004 \u00d7 G\u2192\u0004 \u00d7 G is transitive. If r \u2265 2,\nWr is open in the C2-topology on Cr(M,G) and C\u221e-cocycles are C[r]-dense in Wr .\nAn analogous result holds for principal G-extensions over \u0004.\nRemark 1.4. Theorem 1.3 is of main interest when G is not semisimple or \u0004 is not an\nattractor\u2014C\u03b1-stability, C\u221e-density holds if G is semisimple or \u0004 is an attractor [14] for\nany \u03b1 > 0. On the other hand, if G = Km, r < 1 and \u0004 is a subshift of finite type, then\nWr \u2229Wt = \u2205, 0 < r < t , and we conjecture that this may occur for values of r \u2208 [1, 2).\nIn our study of ergodic properties of extensions, we suppose that \u00b5 is the unique\nequilibrium state associated to a Ho\u00a8lder continuous potential on \u0004 [6]. It follows that\n\u0003 : \u0004\u2192\u0004 is \u00b5-ergodic. We take Haar measure h on G and define the product measure\n\u03bd = \u00b5 \u00d7 h on \u0004 \u00d7 G. All skew extensions \u0003f are \u03bd-measure-preserving.\nTHEOREM 1.5. With the notation of Theorem 1.3, if f \u2208 Wr , then \u0003f is \u03bd-ergodic.\nAn analogous result holds for principal G-extensions over \u0004. If \u0003 : \u0004\u2192\u0004 is mixing\nand f \u2208 Wr , then \u0003f is mixing.\nRemark 1.6. The equivalence of ergodicity and transitivity for the situation described in\nTheorems 1.3 and 1.5 is a direct consequence of Livs\u02c7ic regularity (see \u00a76). The last\nstatement of Theorem 1.5 is a consequence of [14, Proposition 3.2.1]\u2014if \u0003 is mixing,\nthen stable ergodicity of \u0003f is equivalent to stable mixing of \u0003f .\nBefore stating our next result, we recall some definitions from [19]. We continue to\nassume that r > 0. Let f \u2208 Cr(M,Rm) and define the corresponding skew extension\n\u0003f : \u0004 \u00d7 Rm\u2192\u0004 \u00d7 Rm. Write fn = \u2211n\u22121j=0 f \u25e6 \u0003j . Let Lf = {fn(x)|\u0003nx = x}.\nWe say that f satisfies the separating condition if Lf is not contained on one side of a\nhyperplane through 0 in Rm. Let Sr \u2282 Cr(M,Rm) denote the set of cocycles that satisfy\nthe separating condition. We remark that Sr is a non-empty open (but never dense) subset\nof Cr(M,Rm). Nit\u00b8ica\u02d8 and Pollicott [19] studied the case when \u0004 = M is Anosov and\nproved that \u0003f is transitive for f \u2208 Sr .\nTHEOREM 1.7. For r > 0, there exists a Cr -open and -dense subset Wr of Sr such that\nfor all f \u2208 Wr , the skew extension \u0003f : \u0004 \u00d7 Rm\u2192\u0004 \u00d7 Rm is transitive. If r \u2265 2, Wr is\nopen in the C2-topology on Cr(M,Rm) and C\u221e-cocycles are C[r]-dense in Wr .\nRemark 1.8. If \u0004 is a hyperbolic attractor, then we obtain the improved result that Wr is\nC0-open in Sr . Again, C\u03b1-openness, \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1), fails for general hyperbolic basic sets.\n1.3. Suspension flows. We now describe our main result on the stability of weak mixing\nfor suspensions flows over hyperbolic basic sets. Let Rr denote the space of strictly\npositive functions (roof functions) in Cr(M,R). Each roof function f \u2208 Rr defines a\nsuspension flow \u0003ft : \u0004f \u2192\u0004f on the suspension \u0004f . When \u0004 = M is Anosov, it follows\nfrom the Anosov alternative [2] that \u0004f is mixing for all non-constant f \u2208 Rr .\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n520 M. Field et al\nTHEOREM 1.9. For r > 0, there exists a Cr -open and -dense subset Wr of Rr such that\nfor all f \u2208 Wr , the suspension flow \u0003ft : \u0004f \u2192\u0004f is weak mixing. If r \u2265 2, Wr is open\nin the C2-topology on Cr(M,R) and C\u221e roof functions are C[r]-dense in Wr .\nRemark 1.10. If \u0004 is a hyperbolic attractor, then we obtain the improved result that Wr is\nC0-open in Rr . Once again, C\u03b1-openness, \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1), fails for general hyperbolic basic\nsets.\nRemarks 1.11. (1) On a suspension \u0004f \u223c= \u0004 \u00d7 R\/ \u223c we consider the equilibrium state\n\u00b5f = \u00b5\u00d7\u0006\/ \u222b\n\u0004\nf d\u00b5 where \u0006 is Lebesgue measure and\u00b5 is an equilibrium state associated\nto a Ho\u00a8lder potential on \u0004. However, weak mixing of \u0003ft is independent of the choice of\n\u00b5 and is equivalent to topological weak mixing (see for example [21, Proposition 6.2]).\nHence, we suppress any reference to the measure in the results concerning mixing of\nhyperbolic (suspension) flows.\n(2) Moreover, it follows from standard results (see, for example, [24, p. 418] and\n[7, Remark 3.5] for statements and references) that weak-mixing suspension flows are\nautomatically strong-mixing, Kolmogorov and even Bernoulli (so for each t \u2208 R \\ {0}\nthe diffeomorphism \u0003ft : \u0004f \u2192\u0004f is isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift). Consequently,\nit follows from Theorem 1.9 that an open and dense set of suspension flows over a\nhyperbolic basic set are Bernoulli.\n1.4. Varying the base diffeomorphism. Let n = dimM and restrict to Cs -diffeo-\nmorphisms, \u0003 \u2208 Diffs(M), s \u2265 2n+ 1. If we allow the base diffeomorphism \u0003 to vary in\nthe context of Theorems 1.3 and 1.5, then it can be shown using the methods of [11] that\ncompact group extensions \u0003f : \u0004\u0003 \u00d7G\u2192\u0004\u0003 \u00d7G are transitive\/ergodic for (\u0003, f ) lying\nin a C2n+1 \u00d7C2-open and Cs \u00d7Cr -dense subset of Diffs(M)\u00d7Cr(M,G). Similar results\nin the context of Theorems 1.7 and 1.9 hold for Rm-extensions and suspension flows.\n1.5. Brief remarks on proofs and extensions. Brin\u2019s original proof of stable transitivity\nof compact Lie group extensions over an Anosov diffeomorphism uses transitivity\nproperties of the stable and unstable foliations, and the well-known \u2018quadrilateral\nconstruction\u2019. In a related paper [8], Brin gives a direct construction of maximal transitivity\ncomponents which uses the structure of the strong stable and unstable foliations of the\nextension. While the existence of maximal transitivity components holds under the\nassumption that the base is a basic set (see [22, \u00a75]), the quadrilateral argument appears\nto require at least some local path connectivity in the invariant foliations of the basic\nset. Thus, the quadrilateral argument works for general hyperbolic attractors (see [12]),\nbut fails for subshifts of finite type. A common theme of more recent work is the use\nof a result of Keynes and Newton [16] together with the Livs\u02c7ic regularity theorem [17],\n[20, Theorem 3.1]. This approach allows one to prove that the ergodic components\nnaturally define a partition by closed sets and leads to simple arguments for stable\nergodicity when G is semisimple (see [14]). Matters are not so simple when G is Abelian,\nand the proof of Parry and Pollicott\u2019s result on toral extensions over subshifts of finite type\nmakes use of the Ruelle transfer operator. Since we are interested in Cr results, r \u2265 1\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nStable ergodicity 521\n(and cannot assume that maps are expanding), we avoid this approach here. Our proof\nof Theorem 1.3 for subshifts of finite type depends on obtaining good asymptotic bounds\non the average of R-valued cocycles along a sequence of periodic points asymptotic to\na homoclinic point. Using our methods, we give in \u00a73 a simple proof of the original\nabstract result of Parry and Pollicott, and in \u00a75 a more geometric and very explicit\nproof using results of Williams on geometric realization of subshifts of finite type [26].\nFor Cr -extensions, we consider subshifts of finite type in \u00a74. We deduce the result for\ngeneral basic sets using the fact that basic sets contain (many) subshifts of finite type\ntogether with a routine argument based on either Keynes and Newton and Livs\u02c7ic regularity\nor the existence of maximal transitivity components.\nFinally, we note that the results in this paper go far beyond the context of hyperbolic\ndynamics. For example, the results on group extensions over a hyperbolic basic set \u0004\ngeneralize immediately to the case where \u0004 is a locally maximal topologically transitive\nset such that: (i) \u0004 contains a transverse homoclinic point, and (ii) \u0004 supports results on\nLivs\u02c7ic regularity whereby measurable solutions to certain cohomological equations have\ncontinuous versions. See Remark 6.4.\nRemark 1.12. The heart of this paper, \u00a74, is concerned with proving Theorem 1.5 in the\nspecial case when X is a subshift of finite type and G is the circle group. The remainder\nof the results are then consequences of this special case. See \u00a76 for the proof of\nTheorem 1.5 for general \u0004 and G, \u00a77 for the proof of Theorem 1.7, and \u00a78 for the proof\nof Theorem 1.9.\n2. Preliminaries\nThroughout this paper we assume that M is a compact smooth Riemannian manifold\nwithout boundary.\n2.1. Transverse homoclinic points and Smale\u2019s theorem. Let \u0003 : M\u2192M be a\ndiffeomorphism of M . Suppose that P \u2208 M is a hyperbolic periodic point for \u0003 of\nprime period q . Suppose that xH is a transverse homoclinic point for the periodic orbit\nthrough P . Replacing \u0003 by \u0003q , it will be no loss of generality (see below) to assume that\nxH is a transverse homoclinic point for the hyperbolic fixed point P of \u0003.\nWe say that a subset X of M is an H -set for \u0003 if:\n(1) X is a compact locally maximal \u0003-invariant subset of M;\n(2) \u0003|X is transitive;\n(3) \u0003|X is hyperbolic;\n(4) X is conjugate to a subshift of finite type.\nWe recall Smale\u2019s theorem (see [15, Theorem 6.5.5, Exercise 6.5.1]).\nTHEOREM 2.1. Let \u0003 : U \u2192 M be an embedding of the open set U \u2282 M , and\nP, xH \u2208 U . Assume that xH is a transverse homoclinic point for the hyperbolic fixed\npoint P of \u0003. Then there is an H -set for \u0003 containing P and xH .\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n522 M. Field et al\n2.2. Function spaces. Suppose that X is an H -set for \u0003. We choose a (closed) cover of\nX by mutually disjoint contractible neighborhoods, with smooth boundaries. Let U denote\nthe closed neighborhood of X with smooth boundary that is defined by the cover. Without\nloss of generality, we may and shall regard U as a subset of Rn, n = dim(M).\nFor r > 0, let C = Cr(U,R) denote the space of Cr R-valued cocycles on U . If r is an\ninteger, Cr has the usual meaning except if r = 1 when we regard C1(U,R) as the space\nof Lipschitz continuous functions on U . With this proviso, we take the usual Cr topology\non C. We let \u2016 \u2016r denote a choice of Cr -norm on C. With respect to this norm, C is a\nBanach space.\nDefinition 2.2. An element g \u2208 C is called an X-coboundary if we can choose a\ncontinuous function h : X\u2192R such that\ng = h \u25e6 \u0003 \u2212 h.\nWe denote the subspace of C consisting of X-coboundaries by Br = Br(U,R) or just B\nif the meaning is clear from the context.\nRemarks 2.3. (1) We do not ask that an X-coboundary be a coboundary on U . Nor do we\nrequire that the function h occurring in the definition is more than continuous on X. In fact,\nit follows from Livs\u02c7ic regularity that it suffices to assume h|X is measurable relative to an\nequilibrium state on X, as it then follows we can choose h|X to be C\u03b1 (Ho\u00a8lder) continuous\nif g is C\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1].\n(2) In the sequel, we drop the prefix \u2018X\u2019 and just refer to coboundaries.\nPROPOSITION 2.4. For r > 0, the space Br(U,R) is a C0-closed subspace of Cr(U,R).\nProof. It follows from the Livs\u02c7ic theorems that an element f \u2208 Cr(U,R) is a coboundary\nif and only if the average of f over each periodic orbit of \u0003 in X is zero. \u0001\nDefinition 2.5. We let L(U,R) denote the subspace of C consisting of functions which are\nlocally constant on X. Let V = V r(U,R) denote the Cr -closure of L(U,R).\nHenceforth, if r > 0 is given, we always take the corresponding Cr -topologies on the\nsubspaces B and V .\nRemarks 2.6. (1) Let r > 0 and Cr(X) denote the space of R-valued functions f : X\u2192R\nwhich admit a Cr -extension E(f ) \u2208 Cr(U,R). We similarly let V r(X) denote the\nsubspace of Cr(X) consisting of functions which admit a Cr -extension E(f ) \u2208 V r(U,R).\nIf r \u2208 (0, 1) and \u221e \u2265 s > r , then V r(X) \u2283 Cs(X). That is, in the Cr -topology on\nCr(X), every Cs-function, s > r , can be Cr -approximated by a locally constant function.\nThis result is (obviously) not true if r \u2265 1.\n(2) Every locally constant function f on X has an extension E(f ) \u2208 V\u221e(U,R).\n(3) If r is not an integer, then Cs , \u221e \u2265 s > r functions are not dense in Cr(U,R)\n(or Cr(X)). Density follows, by the Stone\u2013Weierstrass approximation theorem, if r is an\ninteger.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nStable ergodicity 523\n2.3. Criteria for the transitivity and ergodicity of toral extensions. Let Km denote the\nm-dimensional torus, regarded as a compact Abelian group. We start by recalling a special\ncase of a general result of Keynes and Newton giving necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the ergodicity of a compact group extension.\nTHEOREM 2.7. [16, \u00a72] Let \u0003 : X\u2192X be an ergodic transformation of the probability\nspace (X,\u00b5). Let f : X\u2192Km be \u00b5-measurable. Then \u0003f : X \u00d7 Km\u2192X \u00d7 Km is\n\u00b5 \u00d7 h-ergodic if and only if for all \u0006 = (\u00061, . . . , \u0006m) \u2208 Zm, \u0006 \r= 0, the equation\nw \u25e6 \u0003(x) = w(x)\nm\u220f\ni=1\nf\n\u0006i\ni (x), almost every x, (2.1)\nhas no measurable solutions w : X\u2192K.\nLet f : M\u2192Km be a Cr -cocycle and\u0003f : M\u00d7Km\u2192M\u00d7Km denote the corresponding\nKm-extension defined by \u0003f (x, g) = (\u0003(x), gf (x)). Restricting to the H -set X \u2282 M ,\nwe obtain a Km-extension \u0003f : X \u00d7Km\u2192X \u00d7Km.\nFor the remainder of the section, and following Parry and Pollicott [23], we give\ncriteria for the ergodicity and transitivity of the extension \u0003f . We do this in terms of a\nfixed equilibrium state \u00b5 on X. However, the resulting conditions are independent of the\nequilibrium state and depend only on the cocycle f . We refer the reader to [23] for details\nwe omit.\nLet f \u2208 Cr(U,Km), f = (f1, . . . , fm). Using our cover of U by contractible sets,\nwe may choose Fi \u2208 Cr(U,R), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m, such that fi = exp(2\u03c0\u0131Fi) (on U ). Note that\nwe may suppose that the Fi depend continuously on f in the Cr -topology. Let S(F ) denote\nthe R-vector subspace of Cr(U,R) spanned by F1, . . . , Fm.\nLEMMA 2.8. (cf. [14]) The extension \u0003f is ergodic if S(F ) \u2229 (B + L) = {0}. If m = 1,\nthen \u0003f is stably ergodic if and only if F \/\u2208 B + L (closure in Cr ).\nProof. It follows from Theorem 2.7 and Livs\u02c7ic regularity that if \u0003f is not ergodic then\nthere exists (\u00061, . . . , \u0006m) \r= (0, . . . , 0), such that\ng \u25e6 \u0003 = f \u000611 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 f \u0006mm g (2.2)\nhas a non-trivial solution g \u2208 C0(X,K). Noting that g\u25e6\u0003\/g \u2208 Cr(U,R) and our definition\nof Br(U,R), it follows easily that we may choose M,H \u2208 Cr(U,R) such that\nM + H =\nm\u2211\ni=1\n\u0006iFi, (2.3)\nwhere\n(1) M is a locally constant integer-valued function on X;\n(2) H \u2208 Br(U,R).\nIf equation (2.3) has solutions, then S(F )\u2229(B+L) \r= {0}. That is, if S(F )\u2229(B+L) = {0}\nthen \u0003f is ergodic.\nSuppose m = 1. If F \u2208 B + L, then we can find F \u2032 arbitrarily Cr -close to F such that\nF \u2032 = b+ v where b is a coboundary and v is locally constant on X and takes only rational\nvalues on X. It follows that for some integer \u0006, \u0006F \u2032 = b\u02dc + m, where m is locally constant\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n524 M. Field et al\nand integer-valued on X and b\u02dc is a coboundary. Setting f \u2032 = exp(2\u03c0\u0131F \u2032), it follows that\n\u0003f \u2032 is not ergodic. Hence, \u0003f cannot be stably ergodic. \u0001\nRemarks 2.9. It follows from Lemma 2.8 that in order to prove the Cr -genericity of\nstable ergodicity (or transitivity) for Km-extensions, it suffices to prove that B + L is of\ncodimension at least m. In the case of C\u03b1-extensions, r = \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), Parry and Pollicott\nprove that B + L is of infinite codimension. They prove further that (a) B + V is closed\n(recall that V = L), (b) C\/(B + V ) is not separable. We are interested in the case r > 1,\nespecially the case when r is an integer. When r is integral, C\/B + L is separable. We do\nnot know, at this time, whether B + V is closed.\n(2) We concentrate throughout on proving stable ergodicity. In the case that \u0003\nis topologically mixing, then stable ergodicity is enough to guarantee stable mixing\n[14, \u00a73.2].\n2.4. Reduction to the case of a fixed point and K-extensions. Continuing with our\nprevious notations, suppose that X is an H -set for the diffeomorphism \u0003. As usual,\nwe set \u0003 = \u0003|X and let r \u2265 2. In order to prove the Cr -genericity of stably ergodic\nCr K-extensions, it suffices, by Lemma 2.8, to find (a single) F \u2208 Cr(U,R) such that\nF \/\u2208 B + L. In fact, we shall prove rather more.\nTHEOREM 2.10. Let r > 0. Suppose that \u0003 has a fixed point p and xH is a transverse\nhomoclinic point for p. Let D\b \u2282 U be a neighborhood of the closure of the \u0003-orbit\nof xH and D \u2282 D\b be a neighborhood of p. We can choose F \u2208 Cr(U,R) and a\nCr -neighborhoodW of F in Cr(U,R) such that:\n(1) supp(F ) \u2282 D;\n(2) if F \u2032 \u2208 W , then F \u2032 \/\u2208 B + L;\n(3) if H \u2208 Cr(U,R) is such that supp(H)\u2229D\b = \u2205, then F \u2032+H \/\u2208 B + L, all F \u2032 \u2208 W;\n(4) if r \u2265 2, then we may take W to be open in the C2-topology on Cr(U,R);\n(5) if r \u2265 2 is an integer, then C\u221e cocycles are dense in W .\nNext, we make a simple extension of Theorem 2.10 to allow for periodic points.\nLEMMA 2.11. Let r > 0. Suppose that \u0003 has a periodic point p \u2208 X of prime period\nq and xH is a transverse homoclinic point for p. Let D\b \u2282 U be a neighborhood of\nthe closure of the \u0003-orbit of xH and D \u2282 D\b be a neighborhood of p. We can choose\nF \u2208 Cr(U,R), and a Cr -neighborhoodW of F in Cr(U,R) such that the conclusions of\nTheorem 2.10 are valid.\nProof. Shrink D so that the subsets \u0003\u2212i (D) are disjoint for i = 0, 1, . . . , q \u2212 1.\nSince \u0003q(p) = p, it is immediate from Theorem 2.10 that we can choose F \u2208 Cr(U,R)\nsupported in D with the required properties with \u0003 replaced by \u0003q . In particular,\nF \r\u2208 Bq + L where Bq is the space of Cr -coboundaries for \u0003q . This proves stable\nergodicity of (\u0003q)f where f = e2\u03c0\u0131F .\nDefine F\u02dc =\u2211q\u22121i=0 F \u25e6\u0003i . Then F\u02dc coincides with F on D\b and so by Theorem 2.10(3)\nF\u02dc \r\u2208 Bq + L. Again, (\u0003q)f\u02dc is stably ergodic, where f\u02dc = e2\u03c0\u0131F\u02dc . But (\u0003q)f\u02dc = (\u0003f )q ,\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nStable ergodicity 525\nso we have shown stable ergodicity of (\u0003f )q and hence \u0003f . In particular, it follows from\nLemma 2.8 that F \r\u2208 B + L. \u0001\nThere remains the case of Km-extensions, m > 1. Choose a set of m disjoint periodic\norbits. By the preceding arguments, we may choose F1, . . . , Fm \/\u2208 B + L such that the\nsupports of the Fi are mutually disjoint. Obviously, F1, . . . , Fm are linearly independent\nmod B + L. In particular, codimC(B + L) = \u221e.\n3. Outline of the proof and the theorem of Parry and Pollicott\nWe continue to assume that \u0003 : X\u2192X is an H -set for \u0003. Let r > 0. Suppose that p \u2208 X\nis a hyperbolic fixed point for \u0003.\n3.1. Outline of proof. Suppose F \u2208 Cr(U,R). Let x \u2208 X. If x is periodic of prime\nperiod n, we define the average of F along the \u0003-orbit of x by\nAv(F, x) =\nn\u22121\u2211\ni=0\nF(\u0003i(x)).\nIf x is a homoclinic point to a periodic point p and Av(F, p) = 0, then we define\nAv(F, x) =\n\u221e\u2211\ni=\u2212\u221e\nF(\u0003i(x)).\nUsing our assumption that F is Cr , and certainly Ho\u00a8lder, it is easy to show that this sum\nconverges.\nSuppose that xH \u2208 X is a transverse homoclinic point for p. Let (pN) \u2282 X be a\nsequence of periodic points such that pN\u2192xH . It follows from the continuity of \u0003 that for\nall i \u2208 Z, \u0003i(pN)\u2192\u0003i(xH ), as N\u2192\u221e.\nSuppose that F is Cr -close to B +L, so that F = b+ \u0006+ g, b \u2208 B, \u0006 \u2208 L, \u2016g\u2016r small.\nWithout loss of generality, we may suppose that Av(F, p) = Av(\u0006, p) = 0. In particular,\nAN(F) = Av(F, xH ) \u2212 Av(F, pN )\nis well defined for all N \u2265 1.\nIt is well known, and simple to verify, that Av(b, pN) = Av(b, xH ) = 0 for all N \u2265 1\nand that Av(\u0006, pN) = Av(\u0006, xH ) for N sufficiently large. Hence, for N large, we have\nAN(F) = AN(g). (3.4)\nIt is now an easy matter to construct explicit cocycles F \r\u2208 B + L\u2014we require only that\nAN(F) be not eventually zero. It is also possible to construct cocycles F \r\u2208 B + L by\ncomparing the asymptotics on each side of (3.4). Specifically, we obtain (i) upper bounds\nfor the right-hand side of (3.4) for all small g, and (ii) lower bounds for the left-hand side\nof (3.4) for an explicitly constructed cocycle F . In this way, we show that F \u2212 g \/\u2208 B + L\nprovided that \u2016g\u2016r is sufficiently small. In fact, since our construction only depends on\naverages near the \u0003-orbit of xH , it will follow that g can take arbitrary values outside of\nsome arbitrarily small neighborhood of the closure of the \u0003-orbit of xH .\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n526 M. Field et al\nIn order to obtain our estimates, we will need to estimate the location of the periodic\npoints in the sequence (pN) rather precisely. We remark that the details of our proof are\nmuch easier if we make the assumption that \u0003 is smoothly linearizable at p. However, this\nassumption is not necessary for the proofs of Theorems 1.3, 1.5, 1.7 and 1.9 which do not\nrequire any non-resonance conditions on the linearization of \u0003 at the fixed point.\nWe note that the construction involving xH and pN described above has been used\nindependently by Bonatti et al [3].\n3.2. The theorem of Parry and Pollicott. We conclude this section with an illustration\nof how our methods give a proof of the stability result of Parry and Pollicott for (abstract)\nsubshifts of finite type that avoids any consideration of the Ruelle transfer operator and, as\nwe shall see, generalizes to smooth cocycles.\nLet X be a subshift of finite type. Given \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1) we define the metric d(x, y) = \u03b8n\nwhere n is the largest non-negative integer such that xi = yi for |i| < n. Let F\u03b8(X) be the\nspace consisting of all functions f : X\u2192R that are Lipschitz with respect to this metric.\nLet |f |\u221e denote the sup-norm and |f |\u03b8 the least Lipschitz constant. Then, F\u03b8 (X) is a\nBanach space under the norm \u2016f \u2016\u03b8 = max{|f |\u221e, |f |\u03b8 }.\nLet B = B\u03b8(X) \u2282 F\u03b8 (X) denote the subspace of coboundaries and L \u2282 F\u03b8(X) be the\nsubspace of locally constant functions. If U is an open subset of X, we let L\u03b8(U) denote\nthe subspace of F\u03b8 (X) consisting of functions which are locally constant on U .\nRemark 3.1. If b = c \u25e6 \u03c3 \u2212 c \u2208 B\u03b8 then by Livs\u02c7ic regularity the cobounding function\nc : X\u2192R can be chosen to lie in F\u03b8 . In particular, c is continuous.\nWe give an elementary proof of the following result of Parry and Pollicott.\nTHEOREM 3.2.

By Lemma 3.4, |AN(f \u2212 (b + \u0006))| \u2264 4|f \u2212 (b + \u0006)|\u03b8 \u03b8N\/(1 \u2212 \u03b8) for\nall N . Hence,\n|f \u2212 (b + \u0006)|\u03b8 \u2265 14\u03b8\u2212N(1 \u2212 \u03b8)AN(f ) (3.5)\nfor sufficiently large values of N . But, by Lemma 3.5, AN(f ) = 2\u2016f \u2016\u03b8 \u03b8N\/(1 \u2212 \u03b8).\nHence it follows that \u2016f \u2212 (b + \u0006)\u2016\u03b8 \u2265 |f \u2212 (b + \u0006)|\u03b8 \u2265 \u2016f \u2016\u03b8 \/2, for all b, \u0006.\nFinally, to complete the proof, note that it is no loss of generality to assume that D\b\nis open and closed. It follows that if we define f\u02dc = f \u03c7D\b , then f\u02dc \u2208 F\u03b8 (X) and\n\u2016f\u02dc \u2016\u03b8 \u2265 \u2016f \u2016\u03b8 . Equation (3.5) continues to hold, with f\u02dc replacing f . Since AN(f\u02dc ) =\nAN(f ) for sufficiently large N , we deduce that \u2016f\u02dc \u2212 (b+ \u0006)\u2016\u03b8 \u2265 \u2016f \u2016\u03b8 \/2 = \u03b8\/(2(1 \u2212 \u03b8))\nfor all b, \u0006. \u0001\nFollowing the argument in the general case (Lemma 2.11), we can allow for periodic\npoints.\nLEMMA 3.6. Suppose that p \u2208 X is a periodic orbit and that xH is a homoclinic point\nfor the orbit of p. If D\b is any open neighborhood of the closure of the \u03c3 -orbit of xH , then\nwe can choose f\u02dc \u2208 F\u03b8 , such that:\n(1) f\u02dc \/\u2208 B\u03b8 + L;\n(2) supp(f\u02dc ) \u2282 D\b;\n(3) if g \u2208 F\u03b8 has supp(g) \u2229 D\b = \u2205, then f\u02dc + g \/\u2208 B\u03b8 + L;\n(4) for some c > 0, \u2016f\u02dc \u2212 (b + \u0006)\u2016\u03b8 \u2265 c, all b \u2208 B\u03b8 and \u0006 \u2208 L\u03b8(D\b).\nThe theorem of Parry and Pollicott is an immediate consequence of the following result.\nTHEOREM 3.7. There is a sequence of disjoint open and closed sets Uj and functions\nfj \u2208 F\u03b8(X) with the following properties:\n(i) supp(fj ) \u2282 Uj ;\n(ii) \u2016fj \u2212 (b + \u0006)\u2016\u03b8 \u2265 1 for all b \u2208 B\u03b8 (X) and \u0006 \u2208 L\u03b8(Uj ).\nProof. Let xj be a sequence of periodic points lying on distinct periodic orbits O(xj).\nChoose xjH homoclinic to xj and let O(x\nj\nH ) denote the homoclinic orbit through x\nj\nH .\nThe points xj and xjH can be chosen so that there are disjoint open and closed sets Uj\nsuch that O(xj) \u222a O(xjH) \u2282 Uj .\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nStable ergodicity 529\nIt follows from Lemma 3.6 that for each j , we can find a cocycle fj , and constant\ncj > 0, such that supp(fj ) \u2282 Uj and \u2016fj \u2212 (b + \u0006)\u2016\u03b8 \u2265 cj , for all b \u2208 B, \u0006 \u2208 L\u03b8 (Uj ).\nReplacing fj by fj \/cj , it follows that we can require \u2016fj \u2212 (b + \u0006)\u2016\u03b8 \u2265 1, for all b \u2208 B,\n\u0006 \u2208 L\u03b8(Uj ). \u0001\n4. Proof of Theorem 2.10\nAs outlined in \u00a73.1, we will construct a sequence of periodic points (pN) approaching\nthe homoclinic point xH . In Proposition 4.8 we give general estimates for the position\nof pN under the assumption that \u0003 is linear on the stable and unstable manifolds of the\nfixed point p. We can and do improve these estimates on pN if we assume that \u0003 is\nC2-linearizable at p (Remark 4.10(3)).\nIn the remainder of the section, we consider the problems of obtaining upper bound\nestimates on AN(F) and finding functions F for which the growth of AN(F) matches the\nupper bound. So as to simplify the exposition, we make some linearizability assumptions\nthat we remove in \u00a74.9. Specifically, in \u00a7\u00a74.2 and 4.4\u20134.8 we assume that \u0003 is linear on the\nstable and unstable manifolds of the fixed point p. We also assume in our verification of\nthe upper bounds for AN(F), F at least C2, that \u0003 is C2-linearizable at p (Lemma 4.13).\nIndeed, if \u0003 is not C2-linearizable at p, then we have to allow for slower decay of AN(F)\n(see \u00a74.9). Finally, we remark that results and methods are a little different when F is Cr ,\nr \u2208 (0, 2).\n4.1. The local model. We always assume that \u0003 is C2. It follows that there will be\nC2-local stable and unstable manifolds through the fixed point p. We use these invariant\nmanifolds as the basis for a local C2-coordinate system at p. Thus, we regard p as the\norigin of the vector space Rm = Es \u2295 Eu with the local stable (respectively, unstable)\nmanifold through p contained in Es (respectively, Eu). We choose coordinates on Es ,Eu\nso that D\u0003(0) = G is in real Jordan normal form, with Jordan blocks J1, . . . , Jk .\nWe denote the set of generalized eigenspaces of G by E . Abusing notation, we will\ntypically label elements of E by the associated eigenvalue. Thus, we label eigenvalues\n\u00b5i, \u03bbj \u2208 E so that\n|\u00b51| \u2264 |\u00b52| \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 |\u00b5S | < 1 < |\u03bbT | \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 |\u03bb1|.\nIn particular, S + T = k and each \u03c1 \u2208 E will be associated to the Jordan block J\u03c1 . We let\np\u03c1 denote the algebraic multiplicity of \u03c1 (thus, for real \u03c1, J\u03c1 will be a p\u03c1 \u00d7 p\u03c1 square\nmatrix, whereas for \u03c1 complex, J\u03c1 , J\u03c1\u00af act on the same generalized eigenspace of real\ndimension 2p\u03c1). We have the decompositions\nEs =\nS\u2295\ni=1\nE\u00b5i , E\nu =\nT\u2295\nj=1\nE\u03bbj ,\nwhere E\u03c1 is the generalized eigenspace associated to \u03c1 \u2208 E . We define Gs = G|Es ,\nGu = G|Eu.\nWe denote coordinates on Es by x = (x1, . . . , xS), where each xi = (xi1, . . . , xip\u00b5i ) \u2208\nE\u00b5i\n\u223c= Kp\u00b5i , where K = R, \u00b5i real, and K = R2 \u223c= C, \u00b5i complex. We similarly\ndenote coordinates on Eu by y = (y1, . . . , yT ) and follow the same labeling conventions\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n530 M.

Let x\u02dcH \u2208 Eu be the point\ncorresponding to xH , now regarded as lying on the unstable manifold of p\u2014see Figure 1.\nLet O(xH ) denote the \u0003-orbit of xH . Note that the forward orbit of xH is contained in Es ,\nwhile the backward orbit of xH = x\u02dcH is contained in Eu and that we regard xH and x\u02dcH\nas identified. Let O(xH)\b = O(xH ) \\ {xH } \u2282 Es \u222a Eu (no identification). Let W , W\u02dc\nbe neighborhoods of xH , x\u02dcH chosen so that (W \u222a W\u02dc) \u2229 O(xH) = {xH }. We regard\nW, W\u02dc as identified (that is, in the ambient manifold.) Let K be an open neighborhood of\nO(xH) which is the union of W \u222a W\u02dc together with an open neighborhood K\u02c6 of O(xH )\b\ndisjoint from W \u222a W\u02dc . We may suppose that K,W, W\u02dc are chosen so that \u0003(W) \u2282 K\u02c6 ,\n\u0003\u22121(W\u02dc) \u2282 K\u02c6 .\nFrom now on, we regard \u0003 as defined on K with the understanding that if z \u2208 K\nthen \u0003n(z) is defined provided that the iterates of z up to and including \u0003n(z) all lie\nin K . Henceforth, all our computations, perturbations and estimates will be done inside K .\nOf course, everything translates back to the ambient manifold M .\n4.2. Basic expansion and contraction rates. For the present we assume that \u0003 is\nlinear when restricted to neighborhoods of p in Es and Eu. This is a mild restriction\u2014\nif \u0003 is sufficiently smooth only finitely many non-resonance conditions are required on\neigenvalues of D\u0003(0)|Es ,D\u0003(0)|Eu for linearizability. In particular, we do not make the\nstronger requirement that \u0003 is C2-linearizable at p. We indicate later (in \u00a74.9) how we can\nremove the assumption of linearizability on the invariant manifolds at the cost of incurring\nsome minor extra technical detail. However, including the detail at this point would only\nserve to needlessly complicate our exposition.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nStable ergodicity 531\nWrite\nxH = A = (A1, . . . ,AS) \u2208\nS\u2295\ni=1\nE\u00b5i , x\u02dcH = B = (B1, . . . ,BT ) \u2208\nT\u2295\nj=1\nE\u03bbj .\nLEMMA 4.1.

Certainly there exists N\u00af > 0 such that for N \u2265 N\u00af , (z\u02dcn) is well defined\nas a subset of K . A routine computation, using Lemmas 4.7 and 4.1 and equations (4.6)\nand (4.7), shows that there exists C\u00af > 0, independent of N , such that for all N \u2265 N\u00af\nwe have \u2016\u0003(z\u02dcn) \u2212 z\u02dcn+1\u2016 \u2264 C\u00af\u03b2N . We give the computation in the case when the matrix\nG = D\u0003(0) is semisimple.

We have a similar estimate on\n\u2211\n\u0006,k x\u02dc\u0006y\u02dckb\u0006k(z\u02dc\nn). In the\ncase n = N , we use the (smooth) identification between W\u02dc and W and our estimates on\n\u2016z\u02dcN \u2212 x\u02dcH\u2016, \u2016z\u02dc0 \u2212 xH\u2016, to deduce that \u2016z\u02dcN \u2212 z\u02dc0\u2016 \u2264 C\u00af\u03b2N .\nSince X is hyperbolic, we may now apply the Anosov closing lemma [15, \u00a76.4]\nto deduce that for a possibly larger value of N\u00af , there exists C\u02c6 > 0, such that for\nN \u2265 N\u00af , there exists a point pN \u2208 W of prime period N such that for n \u2208 {0, . . . , N},\n\u2016pnN \u2212 z\u02dcn\u2016 \u2264 C\u02c6C\u00af\u03b2N . \u0001\nCOROLLARY 4.9.

Specifically, in the linearizing coordinates, the relations \u0003(p\nn\nN) = pn+1N , 0 \u2264 n \u2264\nN \u22121, imply that xni = J ni (Ai +Ci\u03b2N), ynj = J n\u2212Nj (Bj +Cj\u03b2N), where the constants Ci ,\nCj are independent of n. It follows that if we define \u0012 = max(|\u00b5S |, |\u03bbT |\u22121) + \u03b5, where\n\u03b5 > 0 is chosen sufficiently small so that \u0012 < 1, then we can write\nxni = J ni (Ai ) + Cni \u0012n\u03b2N, ynj = J n\u2212Nj (Bj ) + Cnj\u0012N\u2212n\u03b2N.\nIf \u0003 is C2-linearizable at p, then these estimates yield simpler proofs of some of our\nlemmas (notably Lemmas 4.13 and 4.14). However, the results of these lemmas may fail\nif \u0003 is not C2-linearizable at p, and the full proof of Theorem 2.10 requires some special\narguments to take account of this. For ease of exposition, we assume C2-linearizability\nwherever it is helpful to do so, and sketch the general case at the end of this section\u2014\nsee \u00a74.9.\nRemark 4.11. From now on we identify a neighborhoodU of the closure of the homoclinic\norbit of xH in M with K\u02c6 \u222a W in Rn.\nTherefore, functions F defined on Rn induce functions on U \u2282 M through their\nrestriction F |(K\u02c6 \u222a W). When we compute the average of F , we use the representatives of\npN and xH situated in W , that is, near (A, 0).\n4.5. Upper bounds.

We assume that G = D\u0003(0) is semisimple with real eigenvalues. In particular,\n\u03b2N = \u000fN and either \u03b3N = \u000fN or \u03b3N = N\u000fN (\u000f-resonance). The proof in the case\nwhen G has complex eigenvalues or is non-semisimple is essentially the same, just longer\n(note that when we consider the more difficult problem of finding lower bounds we do\nallow for the non-semisimple case).\nIt follows from Taylor\u2019s theorem that we may write\nF(x, y) =\n\u2211\ni\nxiLi(x) +\n\u2211\ni,\u0006\nxiy\u0006Mi\u0006(x, y)+\n\u2211\n\u0006\ny\u0006N\u0006(y),\nwhere Li,N\u0006 are C1 and vanish at the origin, and Mi\u0006 is continuous.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n536 M.

First of all we take r \u2265 2. Again, we give the details only for the case when\nG is semisimple and eigenvalues are real. Without loss of generality, we may make\na preliminary C2-linearizing change of coordinates. Since F is C2, we may find ai \u2208\nC1(Es,R), bj \u2208 C1(Eu,R) and Hij \u2208 C0(Rm,R) such that\nF(x, y) =\nS\u2211\ni=1\nxiai(x) +\nT\u2211\nj=1\nyjbj (y) +\nS\u2211\ni=1\nT\u2211\nj=1\nxiyjHij (x, y).\nIt follows from Lemma 4.12 that we can reduce to the case where\nF(x, y) =\nS\u2211\ni=1\nxiai +\nT\u2211\nj=1\nyjbj , (4.8)\nand ai, bj \u2208 R.

A completely analogous\nargument handles the term\n\u2211T\nj=1 yjbj .\nIt remains to consider what happens if 0 < r < 2 (still assuming that \u0003 is linear\nrestricted to the stable and unstable manifolds of p). We allow for \u00b5\u02dc and \u03bb\u02dc to be non-\nsimple eigenvalues.\nOn K\u02c6 \u222a W we may write F(x, y) = L(x) + M(y) + H(x, y), where L(x) = F(x, 0),\nM(y) = F(0, y) and H(x, y) = F(x, y) \u2212 L(x) \u2212 M(y). Necessarily, H vanishes on\nEs ,Eu in K\u02c6 \u222a W .

Similarly for M .\nThis leaves the term H(x, y). Since Av(H, xH ) = 0, we must estimate |Av(H,pN)|.\nFor 0 \u2264 n \u2264 N , we may write H(pnN) = H(pnN) \u2212 H(xnN) = H(pnN) \u2212 H(ynN).

The analysis in\nthe case \u000f = \u03bb\u02dc\u22121 is similar.\nFinally, suppose r \u2208 (1, 2). We write F = L + M + H as before, and assume \u000f = \u00b5\u02dc.\nThe estimates on L and M are straightforward and we omit details. It remains to consider\nthe term H(x, y). Noting that H vanishes on the x- and y-axes, and applying Taylor\u2019s\ntheorem with integral remainder, we have\nH(x, y) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nDyH(x, 0)(y)+\n\u222b 1\n0\n[DyH(x, ty)\u2212Dy(x, 0)](y) dt = A(x)(y)+I1(x, y)\nDxH(0, y)(x)+\n\u222b 1\n0\n[DyH(tx, y)\u2212Dy(0, y)](x) dt = B(y)(x)+I2(x, y),\nwhere A(x), B(y) are linear maps depending Cr\u22121 on x and y, respectively, The integral\nterms are estimated by |I1(x, y)| \u2264 \u2016H\u2016r\u2016y\u2016r and |I2(x, y)| \u2264 \u2016H\u2016r\u2016x\u2016r .

We conclude this section by sketching the approach we\nfollow in the case when \u0003 is not C2-linearizable. We begin by supposing that \u0003 is linear at\nleast on the local stable and unstable manifolds of p. Hence, we may assume the notation\nand results of \u00a74.2. We may suppose that r \u2265 2, since the case r < 2 did not require\nC2-linearizability.\nWe start by noting that Lemmas 4.12 and 4.14 hold without the assumption of\nC2-linearizability.

In order to prove Lemma 4.16, we start with\na cocycle F based on the function xi (instead of the one provided by Lemma 4.14), and\nconclude that the inequality (4.12) again holds for infinitely many values of N .\nNext, we consider case (b), again under the assumption that \u0003 is linear on the invariant\nmanifolds through p. If we have a \u000f-resonance, then Lemma 4.13 holds without the\nassumption of C2-linearizability (the extra factor N that suffices to bound the contribution\nof the linear part of F is still superseded by \u03b3N ). Hence, Lemma 4.14 gives us an optimal\nlower bound and all goes through as before. If there is no \u000f-resonance, then we must\nintroduce the sequences (\u03c4 s\/u\u0006,N) as in case (a).

Since |\u00b5S | is maximal\namong the contracting eigenvalues there are no resonances of the form \u00b5S = \u0014\u00b5nii .\nIt follows from a parametrized version of a theorem of Sternberg [25, \u00a75] that there is\na C2-change of coordinates on Es which linearizes (4.14) (for the convenience of the\nreader, we give details in an appendix at the end of the paper). In the new coordinates we\nhave \u0003s(x)S = JSxS . We may repeat this linearization for all contracting eigenvalues \u00b5i\nwith |\u00b5i | = |\u00b5S |. Either it is the case that for all of these weakest eigenvalues, say \u00b5i ,\nS \u2265 i \u2265 \u0006, Ai = 0, or not. In the first case, we observe that xS = 0, . . . , x\u0006 = 0\ndefines a \u0003s-invariant linear subspace V of Es . We now restrict attention to \u0003s |V and\nrepeat the linearization process. Observe that there are no resonance problems. In this\nway, we identify a weakest contraction \u00b5\u02dc associated to the homoclinic orbit. Associated\nto \u00b5\u02dc will be a \u0003s-invariant subspace Vs of Es . Components of \u0003s |Vs associated to \u00b5i\nwith |\u00b5i | = |\u00b5| will be linearizable. The same process works for \u0003u|Eu. This gives\nus sufficient information to define the rates \u03b2N, \u03b3N . The proof of Proposition 4.8 now\ngoes through much as before\u2014the fact that components of \u0003s |Vs , \u0003u|Vu associated to\nthe dominant eigenvalues are linear allows us to push through all of the estimates without\ndifficulty. Although we do not spell out all the details, this representation of \u0003 suffices to\nestablish the upper and lower bounds proved previously. The basic idea is that components\nassociated to eigenvalues stronger than the dominant eigenvalues can be dominated by\nlinear maps (weaken eigenvalues slightly).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n544 M. Field et al\n5. A third proof of the Parry and Pollicott theorem\nIn \u00a73, we gave a new proof of the theorem of Parry and Pollicott [23] on the genericity of\nC\u03b1-stability of Ho\u00a8lder cocycles. This proof did not require transfer operator techniques.\nWe now briefly sketch a further proof that avoids any direct consideration of symbolic\ndynamics.\nWe continue with the notational conventions of \u00a73.2. Suppose that X \u2282 {1, . . . , n}Z\nis an (abstract) transitive subshift of finite type. Given \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1), let d(x, y) denote\nthe associated metric on X and F\u03b8 (X) be the Banach space consisting of all Lipschitz\nfunctions f : X\u2192R for this metric. It follows from a theorem of Williams [26], that X can\nbe represented as a hyperbolic basic set X\u02dc in the spectral decomposition of a structurally\nstable diffeomorphism F of S3. Indeed, we can require that the \u0015-set of F will consist of\ntwo hyperbolic fixed points, one attracting and one repelling, X\u02dc, and a further hyperbolic\nbasic set Y\u02dc , where Y\u02dc is conjugate to the subshift of finite type \u2018dual\u2019 to X. Williams\u2019s\nconstruction is quite elementary and all but the final step (adding a repelling hyperbolic\nfixed point at \u221e), is carried out in R3. In particular, we may construct F so that there is\na cover of X\u02dc \u2282 S3 by n open neighborhoods Ui such that the restriction of F |Ui is affine\nlinear, say F |Ui = Aix + bi . Further, if we choose \u00b5 \u2208 (0, 1) sufficiently small, we may\nrequire that each linear map Ai is semisimple with a double contracting eigenvalue \u00b5 and a\nsingle expanding eigenvalue \u00b5\u22121. We choose a Riemannian metric on S3 which coincides\nwith the usual Euclidean metric onR3 on a neighborhood of X\u02dc. In this situation, the natural\nconjugacy between X\u02dc and X is a local isometry if we choose \u03b8 = \u00b5. Moreover, Ho\u00a8lder\ncocycles of class C\u03b1 on X\u02dc (C\u03b1 with respect to the Riemannian metric on S3), correspond\nexactly to cocycles in F\u03b8\u03b1 (X). Hence, we can apply Theorem 2.10 in the case \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1],\nto deduce the F\u03b8\u03b1 genericity of stable cocycles for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]. Since this result holds\nfor all sufficiently small \u03b1, we obtain the genericity of stability for all \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1).\n6. Transitivity and ergodicity of compact group extensions\nIn this section, we prove Theorems 1.3 and 1.5.\nSuppose that X \u2282 M is a hyperbolic basic set for the C1-diffeomorphism \u0003 : M\u2192M .\nLet \u00b5 be an equilibrium state on X. Let G be a compact connected Lie group with Haar\nmeasure h and define the product measure \u00b5 \u00d7 h on X \u00d7 G. Let f \u2208 Cr(M,G), r > 0.\nBy Keynes and Newton [16] and Livs\u02c7ic regularity, a necessary and sufficient condition for\nthe non-ergodicity of the skew extension \u0003f : X \u00d7 G\u2192X \u00d7 G is that there exists a non-\ntrivial irreducible unitary representation R of G on Cd for some d \u2265 1 and a continuous\nfunction w : X\u2192S2d\u22121 such that\nR(f )\u22121w = w \u25e6 \u0003. (6.15)\nHere, S2d\u22121 denotes the unit sphere in Cd .\nPROPOSITION 6.1. Let X \u2282 M be a hyperbolic basic set and \u00b5 be an equilibrium state\non X. If f \u2208 Cr(M,G), r > 0, then:\n(1) \u0003f : X \u00d7 G\u2192X \u00d7 G is ergodic if and only if \u0003f is transitive;\n(2) if Z \u2282 X is a locally maximal subshift of finite type and \u0003f |Z\u00d7G is transitive, then\n\u0003f : X \u00d7 G\u2192X \u00d7 G is ergodic.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nStable ergodicity 545\nProof. (1) If \u0003f is not ergodic, then (6.15) has a continuous solution, w : X\u2192S2d\u22121.\nThe map W : X \u00d7 G\u2192S2d\u22121 defined by W(x, g) = R(g)w(x) is then a non-constant\n\u0003f -invariant continuous function on X\u00d7G. Hence, \u0003f cannot be transitive. The converse\nis trivial.\n(2) Assume by contradiction that \u0003f : X\u00d7G\u2192X\u00d7G is not ergodic. Then (6.15) has a\ncontinuous solution w : X\u2192S2d\u22121. Restricting this solution to Z, we conclude, as in (1),\nthat \u0003f |Z \u00d7 G is not transitive, a contradiction. \u0001\nPROPOSITION 6.2. Let X \u2282 M be a locally maximal subshift of finite type for the\nC2-diffeomorphism \u0003. Let \u00b5 be an equilibrium state on X.\nLet r > 0. Then there exists a Cr -open and -dense subset Wr of the set of Cr -cocycles\nCr(X,G) such that \u0003f : X \u00d7 G\u2192X \u00d7 G is ergodic for all f \u2208 Wr . Moreover, if r \u2265 2,\nthenWr is C2-open in Cr(X,G).\nProof. By Field and Parry [14] it suffices to consider the case of toral extensions G = Km.\nThe result follows from Theorem 2.10, Lemmas 2.8 and 2.11, and the discussion of \u00a72.3.\u0001\nTHEOREM 6.3. Let X \u2282 M be a hyperbolic basic set for the C2-diffeomorphism \u0003.\nSuppose that \u00b5 is an equilibrium state on X.\nLet r > 0. Then there exists a Cr -open and -dense subset Wr of Cr(X,G) such that\n\u0003f : X \u00d7 G\u2192X \u00d7 G is ergodic for all f \u2208 Wr . Moreover, if r \u2265 2, then Wr is C2-open\nin Cr(X,G).\nProof. Transverse homoclinic points are dense in X, so by Smale\u2019s Theorem 2.1, we can\nfind an H -set Z \u2282 X. It follows from Proposition 6.2 that there exists a Cr -open and -dense\nsubsetWr of Cr(X,G) such that \u0003f |Z\u00d7G is ergodic for all f \u2208 Wr . By Proposition 6.1,\n\u0003f : X\u00d7G\u2192X\u00d7G is ergodic for all f \u2208 Wr . The fact thatWr is C2-open in Cr(X,G),\nr \u2265 2, follows from Proposition 6.2. \u0001\nRemark 6.4. The proof of Theorem 6.3 does not rely heavily on the fact that X is a\nhyperbolic basic set. In fact, the only properties of X that we require are:\n(a) X is a locally maximal invariant set with ergodic measure \u00b5;\n(b) X contains a transverse homoclinic orbit for a hyperbolic periodic point; and\n(c) Livs\u02c7ic regularity theorems hold on X. Specifically, given a compact connected Lie\ngroup G, we require that for each irreducible unitary representation R of G, every\nmeasurable solution w to the equation R(f )\u22121w = w \u25e6 \u0003 has a continuous version.\nIn our proof of Theorem 6.3, we made use of the theorem of Keynes and Newton.\nIn some situations, we have to use a different version of this theorem\u2014for example,\nin the analysis of partially hyperbolic basic sets [12] where we cannot use the strategy\nof [14] to reduce to the case where G is either Abelian or semisimple. It is then\nsometimes worthwhile using a slightly different argument based on maximal transitivity\ncomponents [8]. We conclude the section by briefly summarizing the main ideas (for more\ndetails, presented in the context of partially hyperbolic dynamics, see [12]).\nWe continue to assume that X is a hyperbolic basic set with equilibrium state \u00b5.\nLet f \u2208 Cr(X,G). It follows from Keynes and Newton [16] that the skew extension\n\u0003f : X\u00d7G\u2192X\u00d7G is \u00b5\u00d7h ergodic if and only if for every non-trivial irreducible unitary\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n546 M. Field et al\nrepresentation \u03c1 : G\u2192U(d) of G, every \u00b5\u00d7h-measurable \u0003f -invariant and G-equivariant\nmap w : X \u00d7G\u2192Cd is zero (almost everywhere). It follows by Livs\u02c7ic regularity [12, \u00a77],\nthat every measurable \u0003f -invariant G-equivariant map w : X \u00d7 G\u2192Cd has a continuous\nrealization. It follows in the usual way that \u0003f is ergodic if and only if \u0003f is transitive.\nLet x \u2208 X have dense \u0003-orbit in X. For any g \u2208 G, the closure T (x, g) of the \u0003f -orbit\nthrough (x, g) projects onto all of X. We say T (x, g) is a maximal transitivity component\nfor \u0003f if whenever T (x \u2032, g\u2032) \u2229 T (x, g) \r= \u2205, then T (x \u2032, g\u2032) \u2282 T (x, g). If T (x, g) is\na maximal transitivity component, it is easy to see that P = {T (x, g)|g \u2208 G} defines\na partition of X \u00d7 G and that G acts on P (hT (x, g) = T (x, hg), h \u2208 G). The general\nquestion of when maximal transitivity components exist is difficult. (Zorn\u2019s lemma implies\nthat every transitive set is contained in a maximal transitive set. However, maximal\ntransitive sets may not be disjoint.) However, transitivity components do exist for skew\nand principal extensions over hyperbolic basic sets (Brin [8]) and also for certain classes\nof partially hyperbolic basic sets [12, \u00a77].\nWe have the following useful sufficient condition for transitivity.\nLEMMA 6.5. Suppose that P = {T (x, g)|g \u2208 G} is a partition of X \u00d7 G into maximal\ntransitivity components. Then \u0003f will be transitive if we can find a \u0003-invariant closed\nsubset Z of X such that \u0003f |Z \u00d7 G is transitive.\nProof. Suppose \u0003f |Z \u00d7 G is transitive. It follows that there exists (z, \u03b3 ) \u2208 Z \u00d7 G such\nthat the \u0003f -orbit of (z, \u03b3 ) is dense in Z \u00d7 G. For some h \u2208 G, (z, h) \u2208 T (x, g). Hence,\nT (x, g) \u2283 O(z, h) = Z \u00d7 G. Therefore, \u03b3 T (x, g) \u2229 T (x, g) \r= \u2205, all \u03b3 \u2208 G and so\nT (x, g) = X \u00d7 G. \u0001\nWe may now use Lemma 6.5 and Proposition 6.2 to prove genericity of stable ergodicity.\n7. Transitivity of Rm-extensions\nIn this section, we prove Theorem 1.7.\nSuppose that \u0003 : X\u2192X is a transitive Anosov diffeomorphism. Nit\u00b8ica\u02d8 and\nPollicott [19] showed that under a cohomological condition (valid for all known cases)\nthere exist C\u221e-cocycles f : X\u2192Rm such that \u0003f : X \u00d7 Rm\u2192X \u00d7 Rm is C0-stably\ntransitive (that is, \u0003f \u2032 is transitive for all f \u2032 sufficiently C0 close to f ). Previously, in [18],\nit was proved that Euclidean group extensions X \u00d7 SE(m) are transitive for a Cr -open and\n-dense set of Cr -cocycles f : X\u2192SE(m) provided m \u2265 4 is even. The result of [18]\nholds for any hyperbolic basic set X. Density of transitive extensions clearly fails for the\ngroup Rm.\nIn this section, we show how to extend the result of Nit\u00b8ica\u02d8 and Pollicott [19] to\nRm-extensions of arbitrary hyperbolic basic sets. We recover the full strength of their\nresult for hyperbolic attractors. In general, we obtain C2-stable transitivity.\nFirst, we recall some definitions from [19]. Let \u0003 : X\u2192X be a hyperbolic basic set\nand f : X\u2192Rm a Ho\u00a8lder cocycle. Define the skew extension \u0003f : X \u00d7 Rm\u2192X \u00d7 Rm.\nWrite fn = \u2211n\u22121j=0 f \u25e6 \u0003j and define the periodic data Lf \u2282 Rm to be Lf = {fn(x)|\n\u0003nx = x}. Let Gf be the subgroup of Rm generated by Lf . The cocycle f satisfies the\nseparating condition if Lf is not contained on one side of a hyperplane through 0 in Rn.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nStable ergodicity 547\nThe separating condition guarantees that the closure of Gf coincides with the closure of the\nsubsemigroup generated by Lf . Let Sr denote the set of Cr -cocycles f \u2208 Cr(X,Rm) that\nsatisfy the separating condition. Note that Sr is an open and non-empty (but not dense)\nsubset of Cr(X,Rm). Moreover, it follows from Bousch [4] that \u0003f is not transitive unless\nf \u2208 Sr .\nWe can now state the main result of this section.\nTHEOREM 7.1. Let X \u2282 M be a hyperbolic basic set for the C2-diffeomorphism \u0003.\nLet r > 0. Then there exists a Cr -open and -dense subset W \u2282 Sr such that\n\u0003f : X \u00d7 Rm\u2192X \u00d7 Rm is transitive for all f \u2208 W . Moreover, if r \u2265 2, then W is\nC2-open in Sr . If X is an attractor, thenW is C0-open in Sr .\nWe require the following lemma.\nLEMMA 7.2. [19] Let X be a hyperbolic basic set and f \u2208 Sr for some r > 0. Suppose\nthat Gf is dense in Rm. Then \u0003f : X \u00d7 Rm\u2192X \u00d7 Rm is transitive.\nGiven f = (f 1, . . . , f m) : X\u2192Rm, we define F = (F 1, . . . , Fm) : X\u2192Km by setting\nFj = exp(2\u03c0\u0131f j ).\nTHEOREM 7.3. Let X be a hyperbolic basic set for the C1-diffeomorphism \u0003. Let r > 0\nand suppose that f \u2208 Sr . Then \u0003f : X\u00d7Rm\u2192X\u00d7Rm is Cr -stably transitive if and only\nif \u0003F : X \u00d7Km\u2192X \u00d7Km is Cr -stably transitive.\nProof. It is immediate that transitivity of \u0003f implies transitivity of \u0003F . If \u0003F is not\nstably transitive, then there is an F\u02dc , Cr -close to F , such that \u0003F\u02dc is not transitive.\nSince sufficiently small perturbations are Cr -homotopic to the identity, F\u02dc : X\u2192Km lifts\nto f\u02dc : X\u2192Rm Cr -close to f and \u0003f is not transitive so that \u0003f is not stably transitive.\nHence, stable transitivity of \u0003f implies stable transitivity of \u0003F .\nNext, we prove the converse direction. Suppose that \u0003F is stably transitive. It suffices\nto show that \u0003f is transitive. By Lemma 7.2, it suffices to show that Gf is dense in Rm.\nIf not, then Lf lies in a subgroup isomorphic to Rm\u22121 \u00d7 Z. Hence, there exists a non-\nzero k \u2208 Rm such that exp(2\u03c0\u0131k \u00b7 \u0006) = 1 for all \u0006 \u2208 Lf . Choose A \u2208 GL(m) near the\nidentity so that k\u2032 = AT k \u2208 Qm. Then, f\u02dc = Af is Cr -close to f and has the property that\nexp(2\u03c0\u0131k\u2032 \u00b7 \u0006) = 1 for all \u0006 \u2208 Lf\u02dc . Define k\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Zm by clearing denominators in k\u2032. Then\nexp(2\u03c0\u0131k\u2032\u2032 \u00b7 fn(x)) = 1 whenever \u0003nx = x. (7.16)\nLet F\u02dc be the Km-cocycle corresponding to f\u02dc and define g = (F\u02dc 1)k\u2032\u20321 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (F\u02dcm)k\u2032\u2032m :\nX\u2192K. Since k\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Zm, the map g is well defined. Moreover, (7.16) becomes the statement\nthat if \u0003nx = x, then g(x)g(\u0003x) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7g(\u0003n\u22121x) = 1. By the Livs\u02c7ic periodic point theorem,\ng = G \u25e6 \u0003G\u22121 for some G : X\u2192K measurable (even Ho\u00a8lder). That is,\n(F\u02dc 1)k\n\u2032\u2032\n1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (F\u02dcm)k\u2032\u2032mG = G \u25e6 \u0003.\nIt is immediate from Keynes and Newton [16] that \u0003F\u02dc is not ergodic, and hence (by Livs\u02c7ic\nregularity) not transitive. Thus \u0003F\u02dc is a non-transitiveKm-extensionCr -close to \u0003F , which\nis the desired contradiction. \u0001\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n548 M. Field et al\nRemark 7.4. We have proved the equivalence of stable transitivity for Rm- and\nKm-extensions. The corresponding equivalence for transitivity is false.\nProof of Theorem 7.1. It follows from Theorem 7.3 that an Rm-extension satisfying the\nseparating condition is stably transitive precisely when the correspondingKm-extension is\nstably transitive. Now apply Theorem 6.3. \u0001\n8. Mixing for suspension flows\nIn this section, we prove Theorem 1.9.\nLet \u0003 : X\u2192X be a hyperbolic basic set. A Cr -function f : X\u2192R is called a roof\nfunction if f is strictly positive. We let Rr denote the space of Cr -roof functions.\nGiven a roof function f , we define the suspension Xf = {(x, u) \u2208 X \u00d7 [0,\u221e)}\/ \u223c\nwhere (x, f (x)) \u223c (\u0003x, 0) and define the suspension flow \u0003ft : Xf \u2192Xf by \u0003ft (x, u) =\n(x, u + t) computed subject to identifications.\nWe fix an equilibrium state on Xf . However, since mixing is independent of the\nequilibrium state chosen and is equivalent to both weak mixing and topological weak\nmixing (see Remarks 1.11), we shall suppress the measure in what follows and usually\njust refer to \u2018mixing\u2019.\nWe now state the main result of this section.\nTHEOREM 8.1. Let X \u2282 M be a hyperbolic basic set for the C2-diffeomorphism \u0003.\nLet r > 0. Then there exists a Cr -open and -dense subset W \u2282 Rr of roof functions\nsuch that the suspension flow \u0003ft : Xf \u2192Xf is mixing for all f \u2208 W . Moreover, if r \u2265 2,\nthenW is C2-open in Rr . If X is an attractor, then W is C0-open in Rr .\nGiven the roof function f : X\u2192R, we define the K-cocycle F : X\u2192K by setting\nF = exp(2\u03c0\u0131f ).\nTHEOREM 8.2. Let X be a hyperbolic basic set for the C1-diffeomorphism \u0003. Let r > 0\nand suppose that f \u2208 Rr . Then \u0003ft : Xf \u2192Xf is Cr -stably mixing if and only if the circle\nextension \u0003F : X \u00d7K\u2192X \u00d7K is Cr -stably transitive.\nProof. Recall from \u00a72.3 that \u0003F : X\u00d7K\u2192X\u00d7K fails to be transitive if and only if there\nexists an integer \u0006 \r= 0 and a continuous function w : X\u2192K such that\nw \u25e6 \u0003 = w exp(2\u03c0\u0131\u0006f ).\nOn the other hand, the suspension flow \u0003ft : Xf \u2192Xf fails to be weak mixing if and only\nif there exists a real number a \r= 0 and a continuous function w : X\u2192K such that\nw \u25e6 \u0003 = w exp(2\u03c0\u0131af ),\nsee [21, Proposition 6.2].\nIt is immediate that weak mixing for \u0003ft implies transitivity for \u0003F . If \u0003F is not\nstably transitive, then there is an F\u02dc , Cr -close to F , such that \u0003F\u02dc is not transitive.\nSince sufficiently small perturbations are Cr -homotopic to the identity, F\u02dc : X\u2192Km lifts to\nf\u02dc : X\u2192Rm Cr close to f and \u0003f\u02dct is not weak mixing, so that \u0003ft is not stably weak\nmixing. Hence, stable weak mixing for \u0003ft implies stable transitivity for \u0003F .\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nStable ergodicity 549\nNext, we prove the converse direction. Suppose that \u0003F is stably transitive. It suffices\nto show that \u0003ft is weak mixing. If not, then there exists a > 0 and w continuous such\nthat w \u25e6 \u0003 = w exp(2\u03c0\u0131af ). In particular, exp(2\u03c0\u0131afn(x)) = 1 whenever \u0003n(x) = x.\nChoose a rational number a\u02dc close to a and define f\u02dc = (a\/a\u02dc)f . Then, f\u02dc is Cr -close to f\nand has the property that exp(2\u03c0\u0131a\u02dcf\u02dcn(x)) = 1 whenever \u0003n(x) = x. Define b \u2208 Z to be\nthe numerator of a\u02dc. Then,\nexp(2\u03c0\u0131bf\u02dcn(x)) = 1 whenever \u0003nx = x. (8.17)\nLet F\u02dc be the K-cocycle corresponding to f\u02dc and define g = F\u02dc b : X\u2192K. Since b \u2208 Z,\nthe map g is well defined. Moreover, (8.17) becomes the statement that if \u0003nx = x, then\ng(x)g(\u0003x) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7g(\u0003n\u22121x) = 1. By the Livs\u02c7ic periodic point theorem, g = G \u25e6 \u0003G\u22121\nfor some G : X\u2192K measurable and hence continuous. We have constructed G : X\u2192K\ncontinuous and b \r= 0 such that\nF\u02dc bG = G \u25e6 \u0003.\nIt follows that \u0003F\u02dc is a non-transitive K-extension C\nr\n-close to \u0003F , which is the desired\ncontradiction. \u0001\nProof of Theorem 8.1. It follows from Theorem 8.2 that a roof function defines a stably\nmixing suspension flow precisely when the correspondingK-extension is stably transitive.\nNow apply Theorem 6.3. \u0001\nAcknowledgement.

Linearization along part of an invariant manifold\nIn this appendix we provide a proof of the partial linearization statements made in \u00a74.9.\nOur method is elementary and based on that used by Sternberg in his proof of Poincare\u00b4\u2019s\ntheorem [25].\nLet U be an n-dimensional real vector space. Let k \u2265 2, and suppose that F : U\u2192U is\na Ck-diffeomorphism such that DF(0) has all eigenvalues of modulus strictly less than 1.\nDenote the set of eigenvalues of DF(0) by E and set S = max{|\u00b5||\u00b5 \u2208 E}. We have\na DF(0)-invariant splitting U = V \u2295 W , where DF(0)|V = L has all eigenvalues of\nmodulus equal to S and all eigenvalues of DF(0)|W = M have modulus strictly less\nthan S. Denote coordinates on V \u2295 W by (x, p).\nPROPOSITION A.1. There exists a local Ck-diffeomorphism H : V \u2295 W\u2192V \u2295 W ;\n(x, p) \u0015\u2192 (h(x, p), p) which linearizes F along V :\nh(F (x, p)) = Lh(x, p), (x, p) \u2208 V \u2295 W.\nThat is, H \u25e6 F \u25e6 H\u22121 = (L,G), where G : V \u2295 W\u2192W is Ck and DG(0) = M .\nWe provide a proof of Proposition A.1 in the simplest case when V is one-dimensional\n(and so we can write Lx = Sx, x \u2208 R) and k is an integer. The method we present works,\nwith trivial modifications, when there are multiple eigenvalues of modulus equal to S, L is\nnot semisimple and when we allow k to be non-integral.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n550 M. Field et al\nHenceforth, we write U = R \u2295 W . Choose a Euclidean norm \u2016 \u2016 on U such that\nR \u22a5 W , \u2016DF(0)\u2016 = S and \u2016DF(0)|W\u2016 = s < S. Let BR denote the closed R-ball,\ncenter the origin, in U .\nFor R > 0, we let FkR denote the space of R-valued Ck-functions defined on BR such\nthat \u2202\u03b1f (0) = 0 for all f \u2208 FkR , |\u03b1| \u2264 k. Define a norm \u2016 \u2016R,k on FkR by\n\u2016f \u2016R,k = sup\n(x,p)\u2208BR\n\u2016Dkf (x, p)\u2016,\nwhere we regard Dkf (x, p) as a symmetric k-linear map and take the corresponding\noperator norm.\nLEMMA A.2. (cf. [25, Lemma 2]) There exists C = Ck > 0 such that for 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k \u2212 1\nand all f \u2208 FkR we have\n\u2016f \u2016R,j \u2264 CRk\u2212j\u2016f \u2016R,k.\nProof. A simple consequence of Taylor\u2019s theorem with integral remainder together with\nthe fact that elements of FkR are k-flat at the origin. \u0001\nIt follows from the lemma that (FkR, \u2016 \u2016R,k) is a Banach space.\nFollowing Sternberg [25], we define the operator DF : FkR\u2192FkR by\nDF (h)(x, p) = L\u22121h(F (x, p)), h \u2208 FkR.\nSince DF(0) is a contraction, it follows that, provided R is sufficiently small, F(BR) \u2282\nBR and so DF is well defined.\nLEMMA A.3. (cf. [25, Lemma 3]) We can choose R > 0 and K \u2208 (0, 1) such that\n\u2016DF (h)\u2016R,k \u2264 K\u2016h\u2016R,k, h \u2208 FkR.\nProof. This estimate is a parametrized version of part of [25, Lemma 3]. Since k \u2265 2,\nwe may choose \u03b4 > 0 so that (S + \u03b4)k\/S < 1. Now, fix \u03b5 > 0 so that K =\n[(S + \u03b4)k + \u03b5]\/S < 1. Let h \u2208 FkR . We have\nDk(h \u25e6 F) = (Dkh)F (DF)k + P\u03b1,\nwhere P\u03b1 involves derivatives of order less than k of h. Since S is the weakest contracting\neigenvalue, we can choose R > 0 sufficiently small so that \u2016DF\u2016 is bounded by S + \u03b4\non BR . Hence, \u2016(Dkh)F (DF)k\u2016 \u2264 (S + \u03b4)k\u2016(Dkh)F\u2016 on BR . It follows from\nLemma A.2 that we can make \u2016P\u03b1\u2016R,0 an arbitrarily small multiple of \u2016h\u2016R,k by taking R\nsmall enough. Hence, just as in [25, Lemma 3], we may choose R > 0 so that\n\u2016DF (h)\u2016R,k \u2264 S\u22121[(S + \u03b4)k + \u03b5]\u2016h\u2016R,k, h \u2208 FkR,\nwhere \u03b5, \u03b4 > 0 were chosen above. \u0001\nSince there can be no resonances relating a weakest eigenvalue of DF(0) to products of\nother contracting eigenvalues\u2014in our case, S \r= \u0014\u00b5mii \u2014we can make a local Ck-change\nof coordinates H0(x, p) = (h0(x, p), p) on U such that h0 \u25e6 F \u2212 Lh0 \u2208 FkR . Composing\non the left by L\u22121, we have\nh0 \u2212 L\u22121h0 \u25e6 F \u2208 FkR.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nStable ergodicity 551\nApplying Lemma A.3, we see that the sequence\nhn = L\u2212nh0Fn =\nn\u22121\u2211\nj=0\nDjF (L\u22121h0 \u25e6 F \u2212 h0) + h0,\nis uniformly convergent to a Ck-function h : BR\u2192R.
