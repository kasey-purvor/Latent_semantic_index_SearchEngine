The high spectral efficiency\ncan be achieved by transmitting different signals on different\ntransmit antennas simultaneously using the same frequency\nchannel in conjunction with multiple receive antennas under\nan appropriate receive scheme [1, 2].\nThe spectral efficiency can be exploited in MIMO systems\ndepending on a number of phenomena, including received\npower, noise, and co-channel interference. However, the\nmulti-dimensional statistical behaviour of the MIMO fading\nchannel is most significant to the system performance and\nalso supports spatial multiplexing (SM) [3]. When used in\nconjunction with the vertical Bell Labs layered space time\n(VBLAST) that uses the same spreading sequence to transmit\nindependent data streams from different antennas termed\n\u2018sequence re-use\u2019, the data rate increases, under narrowband\nand flat fading channel conditions M times, where M is the\nnumber of transmit antennas [4, 5].\nHowever, using the code division multiple access\n(CDMA) with the commonly used Walsh sequences and\nVBLAST multi-user detector (MUD) suffers from high\nlevel multiple access interference (MAI) and significant\ninter-symbol interference (ISI) in wideband and frequency-\nselective fading channels resulting in severe degradation in\nsystem performance [6]. This is due to the corrupted initial\northogonality between Walsh sequences at the de-spread\nstage at the receiver. Many solutions have been proposed to\nE-mail: c.khriallah@lancaster.ac.uk\nC.

Redistribution subject overcome this problem resulting in higher complexity. Some\nof these include:\n(i) linear-chip equalisation combined with multiple non-\nlinear parallel interference cancellation (IC) [7];\n(ii) CDMA combined with orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM), which is capable of delivering high\ndata rates in multipath environment by largely eliminating\nthe effects of ISI [8]. However, owing to inter-carrier\ninterference (ICI) in OFDM mobile communication\nsystems, the bit error rate (BER) of the received signals is\nextremely sensitive to Doppler frequency shifts and carrier\nsynchronisation errors [9];\n(iii) Using alternative spreading sequences that exhibit\nresilience towards multipath time-dispersive effects. To this\nend, CC sequences have been considered [10] as a candidate\nfor multi-carrier CDMA, offering much higher spreading\nefficiency (SE), a MAI-free operation in both down-link\n(synchronous channel) and up-link (asynchronous) and the\nability to support multi-rate service with a low complexity\nrate-matching algorithm. This however only applies to single-\ninput\u2013single-output (SISO) systems with very few supported\nusers. This is due to a restriction imposed on the length of the\nCC element sequence (KCC) by manageable signal levels in\nthe required multilevel (2\u0001KCC+1) digital modem.\nThis paper presents a new MIMO CC-CDMA system to\novercome the aforementioned major limitations. Our\nMIMO CC-CDMA system applies the SM technique but\ninstead of repeating a single sequence on different antennas\nits sets of CC sequences are reused on different transmit\nantennas to spread independent data streams. This\ntechnique, called \u2018set re-use\u2019, has the following benefits:\n(i) increasing the maximum number of supported users,\nwhich is no longer limited by the manageable signal levels in\nthe digital modem, as shown in Table 1; (ii) by reducing\nthe length of the CC element sequence and using multiple\nantennas in the MIMO CC-CDMA, it may be also possible\nto reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and\nhence, the increased power efficiency of the power amplifier,\nmeaning that the average radiated power is reduced in order\nto avoid the nonlinear distortion of transmitted signal [11].\nTable 1 shows how the proposed MIMO CC-CDMA\nenables us to increase the number of supported users, while533\nto IET licence or copyright; see http:\/\/ietdl.org\/copyright.jsp\nmaintaining the signal level, or equally to reduce the\nrequired modem complexity while maintaining the same\nnumber of users.\nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2\npresents, firstly, the generation of CC sequences, and then\nexplains the ideal correlation properties of CC sequences\ncompared to those of Walsh and Gold sequences. This\ncomparison provides an indication of the likely system\ninterference and forms the basic criteria for the selection of\nCC spreading sequences for wideband MIMO CDMA\nmobile systems. Section 3 presents the general model of the\nproposed MIMO CC-CDMA system and followed by a\ndetailed example of 2transmit-2receive (2,2) CC-CDMA\nsystem. This includes a detailed description of how MAI,\nISI and spatial interference (SPI) cancellation is achieved.\nSection 4 provides the simulation parameters for two\ncomparable CC-CDMA and Walsh-CDMA simulation\nmodels, and the simulated BER performance. Finally\nconclusions are presented in Section 5.\n2 Complete complementary sequences sets\nThe origin of CC sequences can be traced back to the 1960s,\nwhen Turyn [12] and Taki et al. [13] described a class of\nbinary sequences, whose elements are either \u0002 1 or +1,\nand whose auto-correlation function is zero for all even\n(2-mulitple) shifts except the zero shift. These sequences\nhave been called even-shift orthogonal sequences. Suehiro\n[14] extended the concept to the generation of CC sequence\nfamilies\/sets whose auto-correlation function is zero for all\neven and odd shifts except the zero shift and whose cross-\ncorrelation function, for any pair, is zero for all possible\nshifts. According to [14] in order for N sets, each made up\nof N sequences, to be CC sequences of order N they must\nsatisfy: (i) the sum of the N auto-correlation functions, for\neach set, is zero for any shift, except the zero shift (this set is\ncalled \u2018auto-complementary sequence of order N\u2019); (ii) the\nsum of the N cross-correlation functions, between two sets\nofN sequences, is zero for any shift (each of these two sets is\ncalled \u2018cross-complementary sequence of order N\u2019).\n2.1 Generating CC sequences of order N\nusing cross-orthogonal sequences of length\nKCC\u00bcN2\nCC sequences can be constructed using Hadamard matrices\n[5], such as anN-dimensional orthogonal matrixAN, which is\ngenerated recursively using the Kronecker product of a core\nmatrix A2(2\u0001 2) and An\/2 matrix as shown in (1) and (2).\nAN \u00bc A2 \u0003 AN=2 \u00f01\u00de\nAN \u00bc\nAN=2 AN=2\nAN=2 AN=2\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere A1 is positive waveform (+1), AN=2 is the comple-\nment of AN\/2, N\u00bc 2k and k\u00bc 1, 2,y, log2N.\nTable 1: Ability of the proposed MIMO CC-CDMA to either\nincrease number of users or reduce the complexity of the\nrequired multilevel digital modem\nElement\nsequence\nlength (KCC)\nNumber\nof users\n(M\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nKCC\np\n)\nAntenna\nstructure\n(M,P )\nSignal multilevel\nin digital modem\n(2KCC +1)\n16 4 (1,1) 33\n16 8 (2,2) 33\n4 4 (2,2) 9534\nDownloaded 26 Jun 2008 to 194.80.32.8.

Redistribution subject The degradation in CC-CDMA performance is due to\nthe use of a simple low-complexity single-looped recursive\nfilter, at the feedback stage shown in Fig. 2, which while\ntrying to cancel the ISI, between received data sub-streams\ncaused by the time-dispersive effect of a frequency-selective\nfading channel, it does not cancel the noise. This results in\nthe error propagation problem associated with the SIC\nalgorithm [19]. Note that results in Fig. 5 are consistent with\nthose obtained in [10].\nA more advanced SIC is likely to result in less\ndegradation in system performance for low SNR.\nFigure 6 illustrates a comparison in BER performance\nfor CC-CDMA usingKCC\u00bc 4, and 16. The results obtained\nare threefold: first, approximately similar flat fading\n(CPR\u00bc \u0002 infinity dB) performance; second, the resilience\nof CC-CDMA systems to an increased number of users\n(KCC \u00bc 16), when operating in frequency selective fading\nchannels (CPR\u00bc 0dB), withE1dB degradation compared\nwith KCC \u00bc 4; finally, the results highlight the possibility of\ncreating a multi-rate and multi-user system that offers\nvariable HDR services without compromising the accep-\ntable error rate levels in the system [20].\n5 Conclusions\nIn this paper a novel and practical MIMO CDMA\narchitecture based on CC sequences has been proposed\nand simulated for different numbers of users and channel\nprofile using BER as a measure of system performance.

First, the proposed MIMO\nCC-CDMA system overcomes the problem associated with\nthe low user-capacity of SISO CC sequences, by using the\n\u2018set re-use\u2019 technique that supports multi-user transmission\nmode of up to M\u0001F users in a MIMO antenna, or M\ntimes higher total data rate compared to a SISO CC-\nCDMA system. Secondly, the MIMO CC-CDMA system\nsignificantly outperforms the traditional MIMO Walsh-\nCDMA systems in a frequency-selective fading environment\nwith BER performance of MIMOCC-CDMA in frequency\nselective fading approaching that of MIMOWalsh-CDMA\nin flat fading channel conditions. Overall this work\nhighlights the significant opportunities that are presented\nto designers of MIMO systems by utilising the inherent\nproperties of CC sequences.\n6 References\n1 Foschini, J.G., and Gans, J.M.: \u2018On limits of wireless communications\nin a fading environment when using multiple antennas\u2019, Wirel.
