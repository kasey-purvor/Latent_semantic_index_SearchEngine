Drawing on \nethnographic field research in Birzeit, I put recent work on critical geographies of home \ninto conversation with geographies and geopolitics of Palestine. I criticize the tendency to \nrepresent Palestinian geographies almost entirely through the lens of the Israeli \nOccupation. While such studies have a great deal of value both academically and \npolitically, this paper augments such work by developing a different focus and a different \nrepresentational approach. I use detailed ethnographic vignettes and interviews to engage \nwith the domestic practices that make particular Birzeiti homes. These intimate domestic \nencounters underpin my argument that there is a need for more work that apprehends \nPalestinian geographies as complexities that bear a relation to, but are not fully \ndetermined by the Israeli Occupation. \n \nKeywords: Palestine, Home, House Demolitions, Occupation, Representation \n 1 \nSpacing Palestine through the home. \n \nIt\u2019s the middle of February 2006, and I\u2019m sat in the rectangular guest room of Im \nFaisal\u2019s1 house in Birzeit, talking to Im Faisal, her daughter-in-law Maia and Maia\u2019s son \nKhaled. The guest room has large windows on two sides of the room, that stretch from \nthe ceiling to the floor, allowing the winter sun to heat the room, making this room \nslightly warmer than others. We are sat on the decorative sofas that line three sides of the \nroom and surround a glass table, on which Maia has just placed a tray with cups of tea \nand a bowl of Im Faisal\u2019s date biscuits. On the walls sit a picture of Jerusalem \nidentifiable by the Dome of the Rock, and a tapestry of Im Faisal\u2019s family tree, stretching \nback four generations. The room opens out into a hallway leading to the bedrooms, \nbathroom and kitchen. As Maia finally sits down after her back and forth trips to the \nkitchen, Khaled starts to talk about another house. \n \nKhaled: Downstairs would be the kitchen and the living room like we have here. \nUpstairs was supposed to be the bedrooms and all that. But then they just took it \nover before we finished building it, so only one storey was built. They took off all \nthe wood from the windows and burnt it, and broke all the tiles on the floor. And \nthey started making fires inside the house, so now it\u201fs probably going to be \nimpossible to fix up. Even if we did want to build there, and even if they allowed \nus to, we\u201fd have to demolish the house and build a brand new one. \n                                                 \n1\n Pseudonyms have been used to protect the identity of all research participants throughout this paper. \n 2 \nInterview conducted in English, 24th February 2006\n2\n. \n \nKhaled is a young man in his mid-twenties and resident of Birzeit, a village just north of \nRamallah in the centre of the West Bank. The house he is talking about is the one his \nfather began to build in the mid-80s on the outskirts of Birzeit (see plate 1). The \u201ethey\u201f \nwho took it over in 1987 were, and continue to be, the Israeli Occupation Forces\n3\n. The \nhouse was initially used as a temporary military base after it was stolen and subsequently \nan Israeli checkpoint was built right next to it.  \n \nThe checkpoint is located right next to a bridge connecting Birzeit to the neighbouring \nvillage of Atara. Beneath this bridge runs a road that connects Israeli settlement colonies \nin the West Bank with Israeli settlements on the western side of the 1949 Armistice \nLine\n4\n, including Tel Aviv. The Israeli checkpoint was built across the bridge in 1993, and \nis still present at the time of writing. Some Birzeitis suggest the checkpoint was built to \nprevent people throwing rocks at the settler-colonists\u201f cars passing below, although the \nMayor of Birzeit told me it was built to restrict movement between areas B and C (as \nimposed by the Oslo Accords)\n5\n. The checkpoint mainly controls (and often prevents) \n                                                 \n2\n Although I speak basic Arabic, I conducted interviews in Arabic with the help of a translator who also \nhelped me translate and transcribe the quotations. During the course of my research I interviewed people \nwho had lived in Birzeit for most or all of their lives (\u201epermanent residents\u201f), students who rented \naccommodation while studying at Birzeit University, diasporic Palestinians who had grown up in Birzeit \nbut now live (mainly) in Amman, Jordan and in the US, and some refugees who moved to Birzeit after the \nnakba in 1948. All of the people quoted in this paper are \u201epermanent residents\u201f, with the exception of Dina \nwho was a student from Tulkarem. \n3\n I use the term Israeli Occupation Forces to refer to the network of army, \u201esecurity\u201f services, judiciary, \nstate bureaucracies and legislators, settler colonists and many other beside who collectively enable and \nenact the occupation of Palestinian lands. See Weizman 2007. \n4\n The generally recognized international border of Israel, also known as the Green Line. \n5\n According to the protocols established at Oslo, Area B was under Palestinian civil control, but Israeli \nmilitary control, while Area C was under full Israeli control. \n 3 \ntraffic from villages west of Birzeit (i.e. closer to the green line) from reaching Ramallah \nand visa versa (see Harker 2009).  \n \nI begin at this site to explore different connections that can be made between houses, \nhomes and violence in Palestine. The links between homes and violence have been \nestablished in different places and across different scales, ranging from studies of \nhomeland dispossession (e.g. Harris 2002, Hage 1996) to the much more intimate \n(although not necessarily less extensive) experiences of domestic violence and \nharassment (Meth 2003, Valentine 1998). I take this violence as my starting point and \nbegin with the destruction of houses in Palestine (Falah 1996, Graham 2004) and the \nstatistical monitoring of such violence in the Occupied Territories (B\u201fTselem 2002, \n2007). I then juxtapose the destruction of houses with socio-culture meanings of home in \nthis context to widen the implications of this violence.  \n \nHowever, regardless of how detailed this rendering is, focusing on the destruction of \nPalestinian houses and homes is insufficient on its own because it persists with the \nfamiliar tendency to script Palestinian geographies primarily through the lens of the \nIsraeli Occupation (c.f. Robinson 2003). This is true of both long-standing geopolitical \nanalyses of the spaces and politics of Israel\/Palestine, (Falah 1996, 2003, Newman 2002), \nand more recent approaches that have studied the quotidian practices of Occupation \nwithin Palestine (Halper 2000, Weizman 2007). While I appreciate the academic and \npolitical value of these approaches to conceptualizing Palestinian space, I am interested \nin the opportunities that exist to augment and expand them in new directions (Harker \n 4 \n2006, Gibson-Graham 2004). To this end, I explore recent arguments by anthropologists \nStein & Swedenburg (2004) and sociologist Taraki (2006) that call for a more sustained \nand complex engagement with social and cultural issues in this context, and examine \nwhat this might mean for geographies of Palestine. Hammami\u201fs (2004, 2006) studies of \ncheckpoints in the West Bank demonstrates that such an approach, while avoiding the \nconstruction of an overarching narrative about, for example, occupation and mobility (c.f. \nHalper 2000), can nevertheless help us understand some contemporary Palestinian \nexperiences of life under occupation, and the spaces and politics that co-constitute such \nexperiences (see also Kelly 2008). In the conclusion, I use specific domestic stories and \npractices that are entwined with the Palestinian homes presented in this paper to argue for \nmore work that apprehends Palestinian spaces as complexities that bear a relation to, but \nare not fully determined by the Israeli Occupation. A focus on domestic practices is \ncrucial since it allows for the elucidation of some of the complex social and cultural \ngeographies in Palestine, and thus begins to address Taraki\u201fs (2006: xxvii) recent \ncomplaint that \u201e[a] preoccupation with Palestinian political economy and political \ninstitutions has precluded a serious study of social and cultural issues\u201f.  \n \nThroughout the paper I use ethnographic vignettes and interviews\n6\n to create a sense of \nintimacy with the people and spaces of Birzeit. This style of writing mimics to a certain \nextent the work of contemporary Palestinian authors such as Barghouti (2000) and \nShehadeh (2008), whose work challenges \u201ethe long tradition of Western travellers and \n                                                 \n6\n I lived in Birzeit for eleven months over the course of my doctoral research. This included a two month \nperiod in the summer of 2005, an eight month period (January-August 2006) during which time I conducted \ninterviews with local residents, and a one month visit in October 2007. While Crang (2002) notes that one \nof the challenges of using participant observation as a research methodology is finding time to do it, \ndoctoral research is perhaps one opportunity to conduct research without too many other commitments. \n 5 \ncolonizers who simply would not see the land\u201fs Palestinian population\u201f (Shehadeh 2008: \nxv). As I will argue later in this paper, there is a tendency for geopolitical scholarship to \nrepeat this rhetorical manoeuvre (Newman 2002, Weizman 2002, 2004). My \nmethodological\/textual approach also contributes to the growing number of studies that \nhave heeded Herbert\u201fs (2000) call for more ethnographic approaches within the discipline \nof Geography (see for example Larsen 2008, Bailey 2007). I envision an ethnographic \napproach in a manner similar to H\u00f6rschelmann & Stenning (2008: 355), as a mode of \nengagement that is \u201emore inclusive of, as well as relevant to, the concerns of people in the \nmajority of the world\u201f partially because it helps to provincialize universal western \nknowledge claims\n7\n. This approach builds on arguments made for the renewal of a critical \nregional geography (Robinson 2003) and\/or area studies (Gibson-Graham 2004) that \ntakes (post)colonial critiques seriously, while also questioning the ways in which certain \n(Western) approaches to conducting and writing academic research embody a dynamic of \nuniversalization\/exclusion (see also Pollard et al 2009). I have argued elsewhere (Harker \n2007) that intimacy can be utilized as a form of ethical response to orientalist narratives \nthat fold distance (both cultural and spatial) into difference, which are partly responsible \nfor allowing the atrocities that occur in Palestine to continue (see Gregory 2004). In this \npaper I focus on domestic spaces and practices precisely because they create more \nintimate knowledges about the people and things that produce such spaces than many \ngeopolitical studies of Palestine (Newman 2002, Weizman 2002). The broader \nethnographic approach I develop in this article can therefore be seen as one attempt to put \ninto practice a specific witnessing of space (Agamben 1999, Dewsbury 2003). Such an \n                                                 \n7\n Given my specific research context, I am wary of exhortations for more multi-site\/mobile ethnographies \n(see Hage 2005), since relative immobility is a central concern and challenge to everyday life (Makdisi \n2008, Harker 2009). \n 6 \napproach produces a textual cartography in place of a conventional map. This form of \ncartography is a response to the Israeli colonization of the land surface, ground water \naquifers, air space and electromagnetic spectrum, which has crashed \u201ethree dimensions \ninto six: three Israeli and three Palestinian\u201f (Benvenisti, quoted in Weizman 2007: 15). \nWeizman (2002: n.p.) describes this \u201eterritorial ecosystem of externally alienated, \ninternally homogenised enclaves located next to, within, above or below each other\u201f as \n\u201eEscher-like\u201f, splintering conventional two dimensional cartographic representations that \nemploy a god\u201fs-eye view.  \n \nApprehending Palestinian Homes, part 1. \n \nThe destruction of homes in Palestine has a long history. One of the most significant \nconsequences of the Palestinian Nakba (catastrophe) in 1948 (Khalidi 1998, Kimmerling \n& Migdal 2003, Pappe 2004), in which an estimated 711000 Palestinians were forced \nfrom their land (United Nations 1950) in what became the state of Israel, was the \nwidespread loss of homes, many of which were subsequently destroyed. Falah (1996) \ndraws on archival evidence and research from this period (particularly Morris 2004), to \nrevisit 407 of the 418 rural villages that were abandoned by Palestinians during the \nNakba. He finds that over two-thirds of these villages have been subject to high levels of \ndestruction, which he defines as \u201ecomplete obliteration; complete destruction with rubble \nof original houses clearly identified but no walls standing; houses mostly demolished \nwith rubble containing standing walls but without roofs\u201f (p268). The remaining one third \nof these villages has been subject to \u201emajor destruction and partial occupancy\u201f (p273). \n 7 \nFalah suggests that the obliteration of Palestinian houses, public and religious buildings \nin these villages is directly linked with Israeli efforts to Judaicize the landscape by \ndestroying markers of past Palestinian identity (p281). Khaled\u201fs experience of \ndispossession, outlined at the beginning of this article, can be contextualised within this \nbroader trajectory of land theft and house demolitions experienced by Palestinians since \n1948. However, Khaled\u201fs house is built on lands that Israeli occupied only after 1967, \nand unlike the places Falah (1996) visits, the rest of the village property remains (largely) \nuntouched by the occupation forces, at least in the manner which Falah describes.  \n \nHalper (2000: 15), whose work focuses on Palestinian land occupied since 1967, suggests \nthat the Israeli Occupation has established a matrix of control, \u201ean interlocking series of \nmechanisms, only a few of which require physical occupation of territory, that allow \nIsrael to control every aspect of Palestinian life in the Occupied Territories\u201f. Israel has \nachieved this control through a range of military, bureaucratic and legal measures, and \nmost relevant to this discussion, by establishing facts on the ground, which include \nbuilding illegal settlements, by-pass roads, controlling aquifers and restricting the \nmovement of Palestinians. As Graham (2004: 194) notes, \u201e[a] strategy of deliberate urban \ndestruction is closely integrated with Israel\u201fs efforts at carefully planned construction of \nplace and space in the Occupied Territories\u201f8. He suggests that the destruction of \nPalestinian property and infrastructure is part of \u201easymmetric urbicide\u201f: the \n\u201eoverwhelming effort of both sides \u2026 to try to deny the rights of the \u201cenemy\u201d to their \nrespective, city based, lives\u201f (Graham 2004: 193). While Birzeit is located on the rural-\n                                                 \n8\n Equally, Birzeit\u201fs location on the rural-urban fringe could be used to critique Graham\u201fs work, which \nignores the much more extensive confiscation and destruction of rural land by the Israeli Occupation \nForces and the effects this has on Palestinian urbanization. \n 8 \nurban fringe of Ramallah, the house that Khaled\u201fs father began to build could be one \nexample of the Israeli Occupation Forces efforts to \u201eforcibly demodernize Palestinian \nurban society\u201f (Ibid). The presence of the checkpoint now standing next to the shell of \nKhaled\u201fs house \u2013 an example of the de\/construction dialectic Halper and Graham discuss \n\u2013 forms part of what Weizman (2002, 2004, 2007) terms Israel\u201fs \u201epolitics of verticality\u201f, \nwhich results in a specific \u201egeometry of occupation\u201f. Weizman (2002: n.p.) argues in a \nsimilar vein to Graham that \u201ea colossal project of strategic, territorial and architectural \nplanning has lain at the heart of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. The landscape and the \nbuilt environment became the arena of conflict\u201f. Weizman describes this process as a \n\u201epolitics of verticality\u201f because as the occupation has become entrenched, \u201enew and \nintricate frontiers were invented, like the temporary borders later drawn up in the Oslo \nInterim Accord, under which the Palestinian Authority was given control over isolated \nterritorial \u201eislands\u201f, but Israel retained control over the airspace above them and the sub-\nterrain beneath\u2026 crashing \u201cthree-dimensional space into six dimensions \u2013 three Jewish \nand three Arab\u201d\u201f (Ibid). The combination of (Atara) checkpoint built on (Atara) bridge \nover settlement-colony road that we find on the outskirts of Birzeit exemplifies one such \ncomplex geometry. \n \nThere has also been a great deal of work on Palestinian homes in the West Bank and \nGaza Strip carried out by Human Rights Organisations and other NGOs, that in some \ncases is related to this academic work\n9\n. The Israeli Committee Against House \nDemolitions (ICAHD) is a direct action group set up in 1977 specifically to oppose and \n                                                 \n9\n For instance Weizman collaborated on B\u201fTselem\u201fs (2002) report on Israeli settlements, and Halper, a \nformer professor of Anthropology at Ben Gurion University, founded and organizes ICAHD. \n 9 \nresist house demolitions\n10\n. ICAHD estimates that \u201csince 1967 Israel has demolished \nalmost 12,000 Palestinian homes, leaving some 70,000 [people] without shelter and \ntraumatized\u201d http:\/\/www.icahd.org. The demolition of houses in particular has received a \ngrowing amount of critical attention since the beginning of the Al Aqsa Intifada in 2000. \nB\u201fTselem, the Israeli Information Centre for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, \nhas maintained detailed statistics since 2004 that monitor the number of Palestinian \nhouses that have been destroyed as punishment, for alleged military purposes, and those \nthat were built without Israeli permits and thus deemed illegal (see figure 1). In addition \nto a detailed study on house demolitions in 2004 (Amnesty International 2004), Amnesty \nInternational included an entire section on house and property destruction in its 2006 \nreport on Israel and the Occupied Territories (see Amnesty International 2006). \n                                                 \n10\n Information courtesy of ICAHD. \n 10 \nFigure 1 \u2013 Statistics on home demolitions in Palestinian Territories \n \n From October 2001 to January 2005, Israel demolished 668 homes in the \nOccupied Territories as punishment. \n Since 2004, Israel has demolished 1739 Palestinian houses for alleged military \npurposes. \n Since 1987, there have been 1946 houses demolished in the West Bank because \nthey were built without an Israeli issued permit. \nAll statistics from http:\/\/www.btselem.org \n \nMuch academic literature and the work of NGOs thus focuses on now familiar forms of \nplace making within the West Bank and Gaza Strip \u2013 at least to a non-Palestinian \naudience. Each study draws attention, in slightly different ways, to how Israel occupies \nPalestine land. In each account, the practice of occupation results in the destruction of \nPalestinian property and infrastructure, the construction of Israeli property and \ninfrastructure, and increasing Israeli control over Palestinian lives. Through these studies \n(Halper 2000, Graham 2004) and reports (Amnesty International 2004, 2006), the \ndestruction of houses is therefore one of the primary ways in which Palestinian space is \nmade knowable\n11\n. Combined together, this academic and activist work provides one \nimportant way of understanding the demolition of Khaled\u201fs house, and links that \nexperience with those of other Palestinians and the broader political processes \nresponsible for the destruction\/construction\/control. This dominant approach to narrating \n                                                 \n11\n This is also the case in Palestinian contexts beyond the Occupied Territories. See for example \nRamadan\u201fs (2009) discussion of the destruction of Nahr al Bared Refugee Camp in Lebanon.  \n 11 \nPalestinian space also links to wider geopolitical approaches to the production and \nperformance of national space (see Kuus 2009 for review) and territory (Elden 2005)\n 12\n. \nGiven the ongoing nature of these colonial processes in Palestine, this body of \ngeopolitical scholarly and activist work can and has been used to generate important \nintellectual resources for political struggle in solidarity with the Palestinian people\n13\n.  \n \nHowever, (re)telling Khaled\u201fs story as a house demolition risks not only drowning the \nparticular within the general (a threat that hangs over most social science research), but \nmore importantly makes this particular event subservient to the rhetorical conventions \nthat are used to talk about the general (Robinson 2003). It would take an extremely \ninsensitive person to dismiss the destruction of the house that Khaled\u201fs father began to \nbuild as just another statistic. However, one danger of narrating the violence that \ndispossessed Khaled\u201fs family of their living space through tropes such as \u201eurbicide\u201f, a \n\u201ematrix of control\u201f or a \u201epolitics of verticality\u201f is the risk of homogenizing and \nanaesthetizing this event discursively, which in turn allows parts of this event and what \nthese parts encompass to be passed over far too quickly. Robinson (2003:279) has argued \nthat \u201e[w]e need to be constantly on the alert for such moves that reinstate a sense of \n\u201cknowledge\u201d of other places serving \u201cour\u201d purposes and concerns, whatever these might \nbe\u201f. One possible consequence of such a rhetorical maneuver in the context of Palestine \nis that it produces a \u201ehollow land\u201f (Weizman 2007), largely devoid of the Palestinian \npeople who continue to make their lives there.  \n                                                 \n12\n There is of course recent geopolitical work that has focused on actors largely outside the political sphere \nof the State (Hyndman 2007; Dahlman & O\u201fTuathail 2005a, b). However, I tend to underplay a geopolitical \nanalyses for explicit intellectual and political reasons, more fully elaborated below. \n13\n See for example B\u201fTselem (2002). The work of NGOs obviously helps in many other ways too, such as \nefforts by the ICAHD to rebuild demolished houses in East Jerusalem. \n 12 \n \nAlways house demolitions, never home demolitions \n \nThis tension between the particular and general can also be represented through language. \nWhen talking and writing about the destruction of Palestinian property, it is usually a \ncase of house demolitions and rarely home demolitions. This slippage perhaps occurs \neasily when moving from Arabic to English, since the Arabic word beit can be translated \nas both house and home. However, in English, while house refers to a built structure, as \nBlunt & Dowling (2006: 1) point out in their recent book on the subject, there are \nmultiple experiences of home. \n \nSome may speak of the physical structure of their house or dwelling; others may \nrefer to relationships or connections over space and time. You might have positive \nor negative feelings about home, or a mixture of the two. Your sense of home \nmight be closely shaped by your memories of childhood, alongside your present \nexperiences and your dreams for the future. \n \nI understand the term house demolitions to mean the destruction of a built form used \nas\/for housing, and the term home demolitions to imply the destruction of a set of \nmaterial, social and affective relations that constitute home.  While writing about house \ndemolitions may invoke images of a bulldozer reducing concrete, steel and other building \nmaterials to a pile of rubble (see the images in Graham 2004 for instance), talking about \nhome demolitions broadens the discussion to examine the extensive economic, political, \n 13 \ncultural and social geographies (and temporalities) of such violence. My understanding of \nhome demolitions is very similar to what Porteous and Smith (2001: 12) term \n\u201edomicide\u2026 defined as the deliberate destruction of home by human agency in pursuit of \nspecified goals, which causes suffering to the victim\u201f. Since home can mean many things \nto many people, domicide has many different forms, including \u201eeviction, exile, \nexpropriation, displacement, dislocation and relocation\u201f (ibid), which take place across a \nrange of spatial extensions, such as the destruction of a single dwelling, a neighbourhood \nor an ethnic homeland. What unites these experiences is that this destruction of home (in \nwhatever its form) is both meaningful (because people value their homes) and common \n(the authors suggest thirty million people across the globe have suffered the direct effects \nof domicide). Porteous and Smith, aware that \u201ehome has complex, multiple, but \ninterrelated meanings\u201f (p61), nevertheless focus on just two: \u201ehome as centre \u2013 a place of \nrefuge, freedom, possession, shelter and security\u201f, and \u201ehome as identity \u2013 with themes of \nfamily, friends and community, attachment, rootedness, memory and nostalgia\u201f (Ibid.). \nThese dual foci underpin their point that \u201ewhat is lost is not only the physical place, but \nthe entire emotional essence of home \u2013 aspects of personal self-identity\u201f (p63). Their \ngeneral point is that it is important to consider the great variety of ways in which home \ndemolitions impact people. However, their definitions of home tend to romanticize this \ntime-space and can be contested by (among others things) particular forms of \nhomelessness (May 2000), discrimination (Valentine 1998) or victims of domestic \nviolence (Meth 2003). Given the wide variety of spaces that count as a home (Blunt & \nDowling 2006), it is important to define exactly what sort of \u201ehome\u201f is being destroyed.  \n \n 14 \nWhen I asked Birzeitis how they defined home, their responses usually mentioned two \nthings: family and the security of being in place, which do in fact fit within Porteous and \nSmiths\u201f dual typology of home as centre and identity. Firstly, the home is the space of the \nfamily, which is to say it is the primary conduit for social relations. As two young men in \ntheir early twenties put it: \n \nOmar: The home is the family, which is the core of the Palestinian society.  \nTarek: The home is where I was raised, where I\u201fve been looked after since my \nchildhood and where I\u201fm still looked after. It\u201fs mine and it is a part of me.  \nInterview conducted in Arabic, 6\nth\n May 2006. \n \nThe links between home, family and society in Palestine were repeatedly made by people \nI met in Birzeit. Home is the space where one is with their family, where they can receive \nfriends and relatives and visit them in turn, and if they want to start a family, they\u201fll need \nto make a home first. Khaled\u201fs younger brother, Ahmad, put this sentiment in the \nfollowing terms: \n \nAhmad: Most girls are like, hell no, I ain\u201ft going to live with your mum. You\u201fve \ngot to get yourself a place. And if you\u201fre renting a house, it\u201fs as if you don\u201ft have \none in this country. You know, you\u201fve got to buy the land and build the house. \nInterview conducted in English, 24th February 2006. \n \n 15 \nIn Palestine, the family not only refers to the immediate nuclear family (ayla), but also \nthe extended family or clan (hamula). In many cases people maintain strong social ties \nwith their extended family. One example of this is that many people in Birzeit continue \nthe long established practice of living in close proximity to both their immediate and \nextended family. Ahmad\u201fs quote also highlights what quickly becomes ethnographically \napparent, that home and family in Palestine, as in many other countries, are concepts that \ntake on a highly gender-specific form. If the immediate family is imagined in nearly \nevery instance as a heterosexual social unit, then making a home is a labour that is \ndivided according to gender. As Ahmad suggests building and owning a house is scripted \nas a male responsibility. Ola, a working mother of two, suggests that the actual domestic \nlabour required to continually (re-)make a home \u2013 female labour \u2013 gives home added \nimportance for women.  \n \nOla: The home to a woman is like her kingdom, her own country. But to the man, \nis just a house that he wants to live in. For example in the home the wife wants to \nplant some things, to keep everything clean and so on, to arrange the table nice, to \nchoose the colour for the curtains. The man says whatever. The woman looks for \nsmall details more than the man does in the home. In a small house like mine, my \nhusband doesn\u201ft find it hard to deal with, but I find it harder because I have to \ndeal with it directly. I know better than him that it\u201fs not enough. \nInterview conducted in English and Arabic, 4th April 2006. \n \n 16 \nSecondly, and related to the family, home is associated with a sense of security. The \nfollowing two men, Waleed in his twenties, and Moussa in his fifties, explained the \nimportance of the home as a space of security. \n \nWaleed: I feel safe because I live with my brothers, sisters, father and mother. \nYou feel secure when you are surrounded by your relatives. \nInterview conducted in Arabic, 27\nth\n April 2006. \n \nMoussa: It means everything. The home is family, loyalty, devotion, birthplace. \nThe last thing you defend. \nInterview conducted in Arabic, 17th April 2006. \n \nThe security of home is both literal and metaphorical. It is the security of being in place, \nas part of a family, and as a resident in your village and thus part of a broader \ncommunity. While historically the idea of security also has a very literal meaning, as \nhomes would be built with the express purpose of repelling invaders, nowadays, it has \ntaken on a more economic and political meaning, as shrinking land resources and almost \ncontinual recession make owning your own home an important safety net. Even if \nsomeone is without work, they will still have a roof over their head. Dina, who is in her \ntwenties and Fatima, who is in her thirties, make the point in the following manner. \n \n 17 \nDina: I\u201fm lucky to have one, because otherwise I wouldn\u201ft have a house and we \nwould have to rent, and in this country renting is a disaster, with this economic \nsituation, and the political one. \nInterview conducted in English, 11\nth\n May 2006. \n \nFatima: At least, worst comes to worst, you have a roof to stay under. Here they \nsay this thing: you can eat Zeit ou Zaater [Oil and Thyme mix on Bread] and not \nworry because you have a home. \nInterview conducted in English, 21\nst\n February 2006. \n \nKhaled understood home in the following manner. \n \nKhaled: As long as someone has a home, then that person is stable. They have \nsomewhere to be. They\u201fre not in the streets, they\u201fre not anywhere else. So most \nPalestinians see it this way. If you have a home, if you own the house you\u201fre \nliving in, and you\u201fre stable enough, other things will come in time. But the most \nimportant thing is establishing yourself in a home. \nInterview conducted in English, 24th February 2006. \n \nGiven his belief that \u201eif you have a home\u2026 other things will come in time\u201f, the theft and \ndestruction of the house his father was building not only deprived Khaled of a space to \nlive and feel secure, but also deprived him of a stable future. This destruction of Khaled\u201fs \nfuture home \u2013 rather than the one in which he lived in and consequently remains in to this \n 18 \nday \u2013 complicates and extends Porteous and Smiths\u201f thesis on domicide through \nconsideration of the temporalities of home. While home is spatially distributed, these \nspatial formations are also co-constituted by various temporalities (Massey 2005). Home \nfor Khaled is not simply a set of spatial relations in and of the (temporal) present, but also \na set of relations extending towards the future. Hence Khaled experiences domicide \ndespite the fact that his home (understood as house, community and homeland) has not \nbeen destroyed. This experience is possible because of the multiple, co-existing \ntemporalities of his home (Chowers 2002).  \n \nThinking about Khaled\u201fs experience as a home demolition - something that impacts a \nwhole series of material, social and affective processes connected with his home - \ndemands a consideration of how this act of violence (and others like it) involves far more \nthan just turning carefully constructed building materials into piles of rubble (i.e. a house \ndemolition). The term home demolitions invokes multiple and in each case unique \nexperiences of destruction and loss, while still connecting those experiences with the \nmore spatially extensive practices of occupation that cause them. This slight change of \nphrase provokes a more explicit focus on the materiality of the violence caused by the \nIsraeli Occupation right in the middle of Palestinian everyday lives, rather than just the \nspaces which those lives occupy. In other words, rather than an image of bulldozers and \npiles of rubble that the phrase house demolitions conjures up, thinking about home \ndestructions too demands a more careful consideration of the economic, social and \ncultural networks that constitute and are constituted by people like Khaled (see also \nTaraki 2006). If such networks form both family and society in Palestine, home \n 19 \ndemolitions in this context strikes at the core of a very specific network of social \npractices (see Amnesty International 2004)\n14\n. These experiences are similar to many \nother instances of domicide that have occurred throughout the world (Porteous & Smith \n2001), but their specificity points to the importance of space and time (i.e. very particular \ngeographies) in shaping such experiences. \n \nApprehending Palestinian Homes, part 2: other homes in Birzeit \n \nThere is a disjuncture between representing Birzeiti homes and Palestinians homes more \ngenerally as vulnerable (to demolition), and the perceptions residents of Birzeit have of \nhome as a secure space. This disjuncture brings to light the broader issue of how \nPalestine is scripted as a space more generally. Using the term home demolitions (as \nopposed to house demolitions) still apprehends Palestinian homes through the lens of the \nIsraeli Occupation. I now introduce a second person and a second home in the village of \nBirzeit to move from an analysis that takes the Israeli Occupation as its focus, to one that \nhas Palestinian homes in themselves as its primary subject. In doing so, I show that \ndifferent representations can form the basis for a potentially more extensive engagement \nwith Palestine. \n \nAbdullah is Khaled\u201fs cousin and similar in age to him. During the course of my research \nhe told me that we should visit his family home in Birzeit\u201fs old town [medina qadima]. \n                                                 \n14\n Tracing these connections also invites a complimentary analysis of the Israeli Occupation as an unstable \nsite at which among other things laws, bureaucracies, physical constructions, capital flows and the actions \nof millions of people collide and intermingle, rather than some grand scheme, of which house demolitions \nform one part. In short, I think of occupation as a processual verb rather than as a totalizing noun. \n 20 \nAs suggested in the previous section, ideas around home are tied closely to notions of \nfamily. Abdullah\u201fs family home \u2013 called Dar Mohim [literally the house of the Mohim \nfamily] \u2013 was built by his grandfather, and formed one side of a square courtyard \n[housh], around which his three great uncles \u2013 including Khaled\u201fs grandfather \u2013 built \ntheir homes. Hence when Abdullah talks about his family home, this idea references both \nthe immediate nuclear family [ayla] and the extended family [hamula]. \n \nThe Birzeit old town consists almost completely of stone buildings built just after the turn \nof the previous century and although it is now largely deserted (and potentially about to \nbecome a heritage site), it still retains an important place in the collective Birzeiti psyche \nas the core of the current community. Many of older generation in Birzeit grew up there, \nand while most built new homes elsewhere in the village, they still own the properties \nthat once belonged to their parents and grandparents before them. The old town\u201fs \nlocation, flanked by the municipal buildings, the United Nations Relief and Works \nAgency (UNRWA) girls\u201f school, all three churches and close to the village\u201fs largest \nmosque, ensure it remains physically at the centre of the town too, mirroring its enduring \nsocial status. Abdullah\u201fs desire to show me his familial home should be seen within this \ncontext as a claim to space that literally takes place through very particular social \nnetworks (the family) that are interwoven with the material fabric of the village, which, \nthrough its endurance, has become the village\u201fs history. \n \nThe first thing I noticed when I visited Dar Mohim was that large parts of the house have \nnow fallen down\/apart, leaving the remnants of the original home, piles of stone rubble \n 21 \nand a fairly healthy covering of foliage (see plate 2). I was offered a number of \nexplanations for this. The first time Abdullah mentioned his familial home, he told me \nthat an Israeli rocket had destroyed it. A few weeks later, he mentioned his family home \nagain, but this time he said the Israeli Army had detonated a bomb there because they \nthought some political agitators were hiding inside. During the course of our visit to Dar \nMohim, Abdullah said no one really knew how the building had fallen apart. Abdullah\u201fs \nsister subsequently told me that heavy winter snow had caused the disused house to \npartially collapse. \n \nRather than evaluate this progression of narratives as a set of competing truth claims, \neach can be thought of as an equally valid possibility for telling the story of this particular \nhome\u201fs destruction. I argue for pursuing such a strategy because the competing narratives \nthat accompany the rubble and foliage in creating this particular home space are an \neffective cipher for stories about Palestinian homes and Palestinian spaces more \ngenerally. It is possible to tell stories about Palestinian spaces that begin and end with the \nIsraeli Occupation. It is certainly entirely plausible that Dar Mohim was destroyed by the \nmalevolent actions of the occupation forces. However, telling such stories, while \nreferencing the manifold ways in which practices of occupation have brutal effects on \nPalestinian civilians, ignores or minimizes the other ways in which Palestinians live their \nlives, which may or may not be more or less intertwined with ongoing practices of \ncolonial occupation. Taraki (2006: xxvii) has recently argued that \u201e[a] preoccupation with \nPalestinian political economy and political institutions has precluded a serious study of \nsocial and cultural issues\u201f. Stein & Swedenburg (2004:15-6) also suggest that attending \n 22 \nto culture can help us rethink and remap power and politics in Palestine (and Israel). I \nwould argue that a corollary exists in geographic research. Palestine is produced as site \nof\/for geopolitics rather than socio-cultural geographies; a case of how \u201edifferent places \ncome to stand in, stereotypically, for certain kinds of events or processes\u201f (Robinson \n2003: 279). One example of an alternative representational rendering of Palestinian space \nis Hammami\u201fs (2004, 2006) ethnographies of the Surda and Kalandia checkpoints during \nthe height of the second intifada, which explore the quotidian cultural dimensions of \nthese spaces. Rather than focusing on the broader patterns of immobility that these \ncheckpoints produce (c.f. Halper 2000), she instead argues for the emergence of a new \nPalestinian public sphere at these sites. Taraki (2008: 62) meanwhile examines Ramallah \nas an increasingly cosmopolitan city, shaped by very particular practices of education, \nimaginative geographies of conspicuous consumption and \u201ea new globalized and \nmodernist urban middle-class ethos\u201f. While Khaled\u201fs narrative and the first two stories \nAbdullah told me focus on the Israeli Occupation, Abdullah\u201fs ambiguity and his sister\u201fs \nstory about snow also disclose a series of other Palestinian spatial stories. \n \nDar Mohim \u2013 the house that Abdullah\u201fs grandparents lived in \u2013 was and remains bound \nby some of these other lives and spaces as much as by the Israeli Occupation. Other \nstories that Abdullah told me about the house that his grandfather lived in, include a \nnumber of tales about the ways in which residents of Birzeit used to live in the earlier \npart of last century, making frequent reference to the whole family living under one roof, \nthe fact that most people spent most of the day outdoors and the use of the ground floor \nas a stable for animals. A story about the movement of villagers away from the crowded \n 23 \nold town towards more spacious plots of land included a history of a relative who died \nfighting in the Balkans, after he was conscripted to fight among the Ottoman forces there. \nThe narratives about the subsequent degeneration of Dar Mohim once people no longer \nlived there contrasted with the house opposite owned by one of Khaled\u201fs grandmother, \nwhich remains structurally intact. At the time of research, this house provided a free \nresidence to two male students from Khalil [Hebron], who couldn\u201ft afford to pay rent and \nlive in a more modern establishment. Abdullah\u201fs attachment to Dar Mohim highlights the \nimportance of these ancient familial homes to modern day residents. While they may no \nlonger live in them, they still use their homes discursively to make interconnected claims \nto Birzeiti space and familial lineage. While such claims to space could be scripted within \nthe context of living under Occupation, they could just as easily be articulations of \nbelonging that are similar to a number of other practices of making home space around \nthe world (see for instance Blunt 2003, Dwyer 2002). However, I am not suggesting that \nany sort of binary between occupation and non-occupation practices exists. Rather, that \nthe collective effect of academic representations of Palestinian homes that focus on house \nand\/or home demolitions is to talk up the Occupation and downplay and even abstracts \nthe aspects of domestic practice that are less entwined with practices of occupation. \n \nThis argument finds a complement in Gregory\u201fs (2004) work on different colonial \npresents. Gregory examines the ways in which the Israeli Occupation has made \nPalestinian spaces into abstractions. Tracing the way in which Palestine has been made \ninto Areas A, B and C (see Gregory 2004, 137: figure 6.10) \u2013 \u201ctopological abstractions \nproduced by a strategic-instrumental discourse of political and military power\u201d (p96) \u2013 \n 24 \nGregory suggests that \u201cthe violence of abstraction has folded into itself an ever more \nprofound de-corporealization of place and space\u201d (p136). Palestinian writer Mourid \nBarghouti (2000: 21) describes this process in the following way: \n \nThe Occupation has created generations without a place whose colors, smells and \nsounds they can remember; a first place that belongs to them, that they can return \nto in their memories and their cobbled together exiles\u2026 The Occupation has \ncreated generations of us that have to adore an unknown beloved, distant, \ndifficult, surrounded by guards, by walls, by nuclear missiles, by sheer terror. \n(Barghouti 2000: 62) \n \nWhile Gregory and Barghouti\u201fs target is the practices of occupation, a similar critique of \nabstracting Palestinian spaces may apply to a great deal of work that is written in \nsolidarity with the Palestinian cause, including some of the geographies that I discussed \nearlier. Note for instance the abstract geometries implicated in Halper\u201fs \u201ematrix of \ncontrol\u201f and Weizman\u201fs \u201epolitics of verticality\u201f. Such writing about Palestine, by taking \nthe practices of the Israeli Occupation as its main subject, (whether these are house \ndemolitions or the many other consequences that result from them), subtly re-creates \nPalestine as a space that is only known through practices of occupation and the violence \nthey entail. Palestine is performed textually as a \u201ehollow land\u201f, where Palestinian lives \nare alluded to, but rarely elucidated. Approaching Palestine in an alternative manner is \nhowever very difficult precisely because the Israeli Occupation does have such a \nsignificant impact on so many aspects of Palestinian life. As Taraki (2006: xii) insists, \n 25 \n\u201ethe political reality must be the basic backdrop against which we examine the routines of \nlife and the small dramas of daily life\u201f. \n \nWriting the Palestinian Home. (A continuation) \n \nOne way to apprehending Palestine in a different manner is to return to Khaled\u201fs story \nwith which I began, but instead of focusing on the story per se, give greater consideration \nto the location in which it was told. Im Faisal\u201fs home may be far less of a spectacle than \nthe other two homes that I have discussed, remarkable only for its warmth in winter and \ndate biscuits, but its importance as a familial and secure space is perhaps heightened in \ncomparison. While it would easy to also narrate this space only through the Occupation \u2013 \nthe picture of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem symbolizing the desire for the right of \nreturn \u2013 the opportunity also exists to complicate this narrative. The date biscuits and \nmore explicitly the tapestry depicting the family tree not only pre-date the Israeli \nOccupation of Palestine, but also gesture at enduring cultural practices and the grounding \nof \u201eindividual\u201f identity in the family in Palestinian society, even as the overt symbolism \nof the Dome of the Rock picture (in a Christian home) nevertheless emphasizes how \nintertwined these practices and identities are with the ongoing occupation. \n \nFurthermore, I would argue that writing and talking about things such as date biscuits and \nthe slow deterioration of Dar Mohim, punctuated by the sudden collapse of the home \npossibly due to winter snowfall, can become conscious political strategy precisely \nbecause it refuses to script Palestinian homes through the well worn tropes of violence, \n 26 \nOccupation related suffering and dispossession (see also Kelly 2008, Robinson 2003). \nWhile such a maneuver might at first seem apolitical, I would argue that talking about \nPalestinian homes solely in terms of violent dispossession casts the Palestinians in \nquestion \u2013 in this case Khaled and Abdullah \u2013 out from the realm of complex and \nmultifaceted humans and into the realm of abstractions, whether these are martyrs, \nrefugees or simply victims. In contrast, finding additional space for the winter\u201fs snowfall, \ntime\u201fs passing and date biscuits in Birzeit begins to work with the complex circumstances \nof daily life that I encountered when doing research there. Such an approach eschews \nover-generalizing stories and well-worn tropes in favour of particular circumstances that \nallow for specific solidarities, which in turn gesture at more extensive practices of living \nin the West Bank. Instead of a hollow land (Weizman 2007), I seek to witness (Agamben \n1999, Dewsbury 2003, Harker 2007) a Palestine that is decidedly \u201efull\u201f.  \n \nThere is a now an established politics of directly confronting the Israeli Occupation \nthrough direct action activism, lobbying, advocacy work and education. Such political \nwork has established Palestine as \u201ea moral cause\u201f among a very particular set of \ninternational networks, primarily through a human rights discourse that condemns the \nmanifold wrongdoings that are intrinsically part of occupying another nation. Such work \nis both absolutely necessary and in some circumstances effective. This is particularly the \ncase when organizations are able to generate quantitative data (see B\u201fTselem 2007 and \nAmnesty International 2004), given the widespread \u201etrust in numbers\u201f (Porter 1995).  \n \n 27 \nHowever, what I want to suggest is that it may also prove beneficial to explore and \nexperiment with complimentary strategies. People such as Khaled and Abdullah have \ntheir own specific cultural and historical contexts, and while they have undoubtedly been \naffected in many different ways by the actions of the Israeli Occupation, they are also \npeople who have been affected by time and snowfall. I think foregrounding the \nmultifaceted nature of Khaled and Abdullah\u201fs pasts and presents might help us to \nimagine a Palestinian future that is not tied so intimately to Israeli Occupation, where \nPalestinians move beyond tropes such as refugee, victim or terrorist\n15\n. Similarly, the \nhomes of Khaled and Abdullah are complex sites at which ideas around family and \nsecurity, the construction and destruction of built materials, and some of the histories and \ngeographies of Birzeit village and Palestine intersect\n16\n. These domestic spaces and \npractices (in contrast to the demolished home) are an effective milieu for generating more \ncomplex representations because of the banal, quotidian and intimate practices that take \nplace there, (in addition to the violent and\/or destructive processes that may co-constitute \nsuch sites). Envisioning Palestinians in Birzeit as people who make homes in particular \nways, while nevertheless living under occupation, encourages greater degrees of intimate \nengagement than geopolitical analyses (Weizman 2007). Intimacy is important in this \ncontext because it challenges the orientalist practices of folding distance (both cultural \nand spatial) into difference that are partly responsible for allowing the atrocities that \noccur in Palestine to continue (Said 1986, Gregory 2004). This argument builds on \n                                                 \n15\n Famed Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish once hoped for \u201ea normal life where we [Palestinians] are \nneither heroes nor victims\u201f (Darwish, quoted in Gregory 2004, 138). \n16\n Another example: after I wrote the first draft of this paper, I visited Birzeit again. When I met Abdullah, \nhe was excited to tell me that he currently seeking funding that will help him renovate Dar Mohim. Once \nhis familial home has been rebuilt, he hopes to create a small museum and set up an computer and internet \ntraining facility that can (re-)educate local people who are currently under-employed. \n 28 \ncritical geographies of home that explore not only the intersection of broader relations of \npower with\/in intimate domestic spaces, but also how this intimacy can itself do political \nwork (hooks 1990, Staeheli 1996, Pratt 2004). This mode of academic practice, which \nheeds Taraki\u201fs (2006: xxvii) call for more \u201eserious study of social and cultural issues\u201f in \nPalestine, also contributes to the production of what Robinson (2003) calls a more \ncosmopolitan geography that adopts a post-colonial sensibility and reengages with \nregional\/area studies to avoid the drive towards hegemony, universality and exclusion \nstill present in much western geography (see also Gibson-Graham 2004, H\u00f6rschelmann & \nStenning 2008, Pollard et al 2009). \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nMy thanks to all the residents of Birzeit who helped me with my research.
