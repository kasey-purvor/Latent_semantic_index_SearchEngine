These are just some of the issues\ndiscussed by Bernard Rethore.\nBernard Rethore, Chairman of the Board Emeritus, Chairman\/CEO, board member of\nnumerous US companies and farseeing thinker speaks about some of the controversial\nissues facing profit and not-for-profit organisations in the USA. An expert on\ngovernance with a strong interest in the emerging subject of \u201ccorporate democracy\u201d,\nBernard Rethore refers his comments to US and non US audiences alike.\n2Z\/Papers\/Bernard Rethore Interview\/Bernard Rethore interview \u2013 final 2 - 26\/03\/2009\nWhat do you consider the future to be for the chairman CEO\/role duality\npractice of the US?\nI think that the dual chairman\/CEO in the United States will continue to be dominant,\ndespite the increase in the number of companies that reflect role separation. This\nlatter increase arises because of \u201cgovernance committees\u201d that are responding to\npressure for presumed improvement in organizational approach. Further, a practice\nthat will probably not change is role separation at the time, typically, of internal\nsuccession. Until the new person \u2018beds in\u2019, they will often serve only as CEO, but\nonce \u2018in\u2019, they will be offered the CEO\/chairman combination. But, all that said, the\ndominant culture is, and likely will be, to have the CEO also be chairman.\nWhat are the advantages of role duality?\nRepresentation! For the most senior management person in the organisation, having\nthat double role, lends additional gravitas. Sitting down at the table as only President\nand Chief Executive diminishes status and stature in the US environment. Consider a\nmilitary analogy, how many four star officers negotiate as equals with those that have\nthree stars? There\u2019s a clear difference.\nThe two principal obligations of a Board are to insure that an effective CEO is in\nplace and that he\/she has a sensible strategic plan, a long term vision and a program\nfor creating value for shareholders. Giving the CEO dual authority can facilitate this.\nSome assert that a separate Chairman is needed to craft the board agenda. But that is\nnot a major task. There\u2019s an ebb and flow of things that companies must do over\n3Z\/Papers\/Bernard Rethore Interview\/Bernard Rethore interview \u2013 final 2 - 26\/03\/2009\ntime, and that boards must do. Having a separate chairman who presides over such\nduties is not really a requirement, nor is it significant as an activity.\nAnd, in the US, we have made major strides forward here by taking an alternative\napproach to improving the quality of governance. The US strongly leans toward the\nidentification of a lead independent director (LID) -- a role that comes in several\nforms. There is a regulatory requirement that a public company have an individual\nwho is an independent director to chair the executive sessions of the board. This\nindividual need not be a first among equals but more a spokesperson for the\nindependent directors. That individual tends to serve de facto as the non- executive\nchairman in terms of keeping an eye on the board agenda and also being a governance\nmentor for the CEO. The lead independent director can also serve as an advisor and\ncounsellor for the dual chairman and CEO.\nIs the lead independent director (LID) sufficiently respected to be given the\nnecessary support when intervention is necessary?\nThe lead independent director tends to be selected by his\/her peers, according to the\nstature of the person, and perhaps their longevity on the board of the company. To be\nthe lead director, you need to be recognised by your peers. When that individual\nmeets with the chairman\/CEO, he\/she already has a great deal of respect in the eyes of\nthe chairman\/CEO. We have an environment in the US where the CEO turns over\nabout every five years. An independent director who has been on that board for a\ntime and is respected by his\/her peers, and has probably hired the chairman\/CEO, is\nquite different from the case where a long standing CEO\/chairman has seen the board\nturn over. The lead independent director should be someone who is not going to be\n4Z\/Papers\/Bernard Rethore Interview\/Bernard Rethore interview \u2013 final 2 - 26\/03\/2009\nantagonistic to the CEO, but someone who can be quite strong in what they do, while\nstill doing it, collegially.\nIs it unrealistic to expect collegiality with a strong chairman\/CEO?\nNo! Such dynamics I see in the board room. There is some natural conflict around\nbeing part of a team but needing to stake out your own ground. But, this is about\nqualities of directors: the ability to be independent; to have a sense of judgement; to\nhave the courage of one\u2019s convictions; to be a little bit sceptical; to raise hard\nquestions; and, to challenge one\u2019s peers when necessary. The subject could be\nstrategy or a proposed operational programme. I think directors of a like mind and\ntype have no problem with that.\nDoes the dual chair\/CEO role reduce the moral character of its incumbent?\nPerhaps I\u2019m just utopian but I have been very impressed with the CEOs and\nchairman\/CEOs I\u2019ve served with in public companies. I\u2019ve served on eight public\ncompany boards and, in the main, found CEOs\/chairman CEOs of substance and\nintegrity, who are committed to creating value for their shareholders. There may be a\ndegree of self selection here because it would be unwise in the United States to\nbecome a director of a company and not have undertaken rigorous due diligence about\nthe character of the company and the principles of the people, both management and\non the floor, who comprise it. The stakes are too high.\nMany people talk about due diligence. Very few people go into detail. What are\nyou looking for? How long does due diligence take?\n5Z\/Papers\/Bernard Rethore Interview\/Bernard Rethore interview \u2013 final 2 - 26\/03\/2009\nThis depends on each case. Let me divide the world into two parts. One part is just to\nunderstand the company situation, which comes from my McKinsey days!\nUnderstanding a company and its industry was a sort of Management 101 training for\nMcKinsey Associates. Get a sense of the profit economics of the enterprise. What\ndrives it? What makes it go? Where does this particular institution fit into the\ncompetitive universe in the Michael Porter sense?\nThat\u2019s the first piece of due diligence and usually that\u2019s pretty readily determinable.\nThe other side of due diligence is around insight on reputation and character. That is\ndone through individuals that you know or that you can get to. Conversations of that\nsort are open to litigation and question in the USA. So, people may be circumspect\nabout what they say. You\u2019ve got to enter the network and find out about Joe Jones or\nSally Smith and what have they done before, what is their signature, how well are\nthey regarded by other people, either in companies or on boards or industry\nassociations? To some degree, it is what a search firm does with candidates going out\nfor reference! The advantage of the network is that people know one another. I think\nthat still has value today. Not simply \u201cYou scratch my back and I\u2019ll scratch yours\u201d,\nbut rather the ability to have an off-the-record conversation of substance.\nIs your experience that a board more selects than vets candidates or both?\nBoth. Increasingly, the real locus of selection for directors is the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee. That committee\u2019s existence and importance have grown\ndramatically over the last few years, with the emphasis on director independence.\nTypically, the lead director is the chair of the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee. The days when the CEO tells the board, I want to bring these three guys\n6Z\/Papers\/Bernard Rethore Interview\/Bernard Rethore interview \u2013 final 2 - 26\/03\/2009\non the board, three people who are members of my club, whom I know, that is\nhistory!\nWhat is the balance between the board directors trawling their network for a\nnew director and that of hiring search consultants?\nI believe it\u2019s more going to search. And, it\u2019s become an important line of business for\nthe large search firms. Fees have escalated but search consultants have contacts at the\nhighest levels. And, from their perspective, this has become an interesting and sought\nafter activity.\nIs the search process, then, really the privilege of the larger corporation?\nCertainly it\u2019s easier for the large company because of the fees that are involved. You\nhave to look at that more closely, if you\u2019re a small company. On the other hand, what\nis large and what is small? More companies are feeling the heat to find qualified\ndirectors in a tightened market. And, the fact of the matter is that, if you introduce a\nsearch firm into the process, there is a certain confidence that comes forward as a\nresult in terms of the independence, thoroughness and perhaps integrity of what is\ndone.\nYou made a strong point about culture underlying US role duality versus UK\nrole separation. Is that how you see these two systems, as aspects of national\nculture, or is there a governance and business advantage of one against the\nother?\nWell, I certainly think that culture dominates. When I say culture, I mean the history\nof practice in the country. My assertion is that if you diminish the importance of the\n7Z\/Papers\/Bernard Rethore Interview\/Bernard Rethore interview \u2013 final 2 - 26\/03\/2009\nCEO in the USA, if he\/she is not also chairman, then the person simply isn\u2019t heard as\nwell. If you\u2019re in the UK, the strong CEO role has served well for companies and so\npeople listen. Really, we\u2019re talking what makes sense for the particular enterprise in\nthe environment in which it operates.\nWhy then has the \u201cnot-for-profit sector\u201d gone for role separation bearing in\nmind US cultural norms of role duality?\nThe \u201cnot for profit sector\u201d has less moved to role separation than simply followed the\npractice for some time. Let me take the example of academia. There is typically a\nChairman of the Board of Trustees and there is a President who is CEO of the college\nor university. That works incredibly well in my view and I would do nothing to\nchange those positions. It is largely a matter of history. But, also the practice has\nworked. The same occurs for major foundations. The profit and not-for-profit worlds\nsimply have different traditions in the US.\nHow do you see the impact and validity of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation?\nAt the outset, I was sceptical, even antagonistic about Sarbanes-Oxley. But, I\nremember a meeting at the University of Delaware Director\u2019s College, at which one\npresenter made the point that something like 15% of all large companies in the United\nStates had to acknowledge \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d -- as defined in the legislation -- in\ntheir control systems. That\u2019s outrageous and the statement really rocked me. It is\ndisturbing that there were so many large public companies who found such\ndeficiencies in control. So beyond and despite role separation or role duality, we still\nface substantial control problems. And, often it is very basic stuff. It\u2019s a quality\nmandate. You should have a series of steps to follow to effect a control and you must\n8Z\/Papers\/Bernard Rethore Interview\/Bernard Rethore interview \u2013 final 2 - 26\/03\/2009\nfollow them. And, by the way, write it all down so that people can read it because you\ncan\u2019t rely on people remembering.\nPutting proper controls in place is essential, and confirming this is necessary, even\nthough it adds materially to the cost of the audit. However, there is another perhaps\nmore significant \u2018cost\u2019 of Sarbanes-Oxley. And, it can go all the way up to board\nroom. It is termed the \u2018check the box\u2019 mentality, in which individuals are so focused\non conforming to the rules that their focus goes almost exclusively to those rules! Not\non strategy, competitive situation or value creation but on compliance.\nThen, what is the future for Sarbanes-Oxley?\nI think Sarbanes-Oxley will endure. However, I would expect that the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(PCAOB) are going to be more creative and thoughtful in their interpretation of some\nof the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley. The level of detail needs reducing, which can\nreduce cost. Hopefully, too, the frequency of compliance audits under Section 404 of\nthe Act, will be reduced. And, there are some efforts to reduce the requirements for\nsmaller companies. But, still, Sarbanes-Oxley will remain.\nMany of our public policies do not drive off good, hard economics but come out of\nthe political arena. This goes to one of my concerns and it\u2019s a growing concern here\nin the US: the things done in the name of \u201ccorporate democracy\u201d, which could lead\ninstead to governance anarchy.\nPlease explain corporate democracy?\n9Z\/Papers\/Bernard Rethore Interview\/Bernard Rethore interview \u2013 final 2 - 26\/03\/2009\nLike so many business terms, \u201ccorporate democracy\u201d is terribly imprecise in\ndefinition. What one sees and hears in the media under the banner of corporate\ndemocracy is a range of things that have as their end purpose some modification in\nthe way enterprises, public enterprises, are governed here in the US, presumably with\nmore input and involvement from their shareholders. This has favourable\nconnotations around it because of the word \u2018democracy\u2019. But, unfortunately, under\nthat umbrella and, to some degree I would say, under the guise of something good and\nelevating of governance, come a number of things which at the end of the day could\ncombine to have a quite different impact, and in fact be antithetical to the success of\nenterprise and the openness and transparency of management action.\nHad corporate democracy simply gone more towards the arena of independence of\ndirectors who are working for shareholders rather than acting as colleagues of senior\nmanagement, that would be a beneficial direction. Unfortunately, attached to\ncorporate democracy are initiatives that I think individually may have great merit (and\napparent logic) but which combined can be counter productive and have quite\nunintended consequences, indeed the proverbial \u2018perfect storm\u2019.\nBoards have largely been moved to annual election of all directors, rather than the\nstaggered three-year terms typical in the past. Elections are moving to a \u2018majority\u2019\nversus \u2018plurality\u2019 form. The voting of broker held shares is under review, as is making\nit easier for shareholders to nominate alternative directors. Some seek also to\nreimburse those who champion outside proxy proposals for the cost of so doing. Self-\ninterested, and likely quite short term, shareholders such as hedge funds can\n10\nZ\/Papers\/Bernard Rethore Interview\/Bernard Rethore interview \u2013 final 2 - 26\/03\/2009\nincreasingly threaten and combine votes to push managements to act in ways the\nfunds judge appropriate.\nAt the end of the day, direction and control of an enterprise could be moved in the\nworst case from an experienced board, committed as it must be under the law, to\nserving the interests of all shareholders, to some new board influenced strongly to\nserve relative special interests.\nWhy has this movement arisen?\nWhy has it arisen? Many people with quite different agendas are involved, with\nmotives that range from selfish to pure. And much has been driven by the failures\nand patent self interest of the senior managements of some corporations, not just in\nthe US but also in Europe. With their boards, they have sometimes breached their\ntrust through actions that were illegal, unethical, or simply sleazy. This ranges from\nmajor events like the Enron debacle to now the myriad number of cases of options\nbackdatings that are surfacing. Who is asking the question, \u201cWhat are we doing\nhere?,or \u201cIs this right?\u201d You have to challenge yourself and you have to challenge the\npractices that are out there and the ground rules of \u2018cultural law\u2019 that let them occur.\nSo there\u2019s one piece of it.\nThen we have another piece in the USA and that is the sometimes outrageous\ncompensation of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), often paid out when shareholders\nthemselves have had no gains in value. As you know, in the US we\u2019ve tended to have\nmore generous compensation packages than has been the case elsewhere. So out of\nthat comes a real distaste, which has been heavily touted in the media, either as news\n11\nZ\/Papers\/Bernard Rethore Interview\/Bernard Rethore interview \u2013 final 2 - 26\/03\/2009\nor through people who have their own agenda, but none of which is flattering or\ncomplimentary to the captains of industry.\nAs they should, people want to rein in and punish villains; aspects of corporate\ndemocracy may seem like ways to do so.\nSo what to do?\nI think we need to be damned careful. Let\u2019s come back to a couple of basics here.\nWhere laws have been broken, and much of the stock option backdating seems to be\nthat, we can find law that says, \u2018this is a misappropriation of the assets of companies\nand their shareholders\u2019. Then, we have to be absolutely vigilant in prosecuting\npeople that did the wrong thing. And doing it as publicly as possible, because \u2018public\nhangings\u2019 do have a therapeutic effect, particularly on the public who properly expect\naccountability from people who hold great responsibility. And, I think we have to be\nreligious about that. Unfortunately, the legal process can take very long to get\nsomething finally done. People want bad deeds punished today.\nThe other area where we need to be vigilant is about opening access to the proxy to\nshareholder groups. A hedge fund that might have 5 or 6% of the stock of a company,\nbut can get some colleague funds to join it, something easily done, may get elected\ntwo or three members of a board of perhaps ten members. Now we\u2019ve got a 5% per\ncent shareholder with the muscle to account for literally 20 or 30% of the board\u2019s\ncomposition. That\u2019s appalling!\n12\nZ\/Papers\/Bernard Rethore Interview\/Bernard Rethore interview \u2013 final 2 - 26\/03\/2009\nIf you think of the climate in the States, where litigation is so much a part of our\nculture, the thought of ongoing \u2018shareholder\u2019 fights with some very tough people who\nare well armed in lawyers, is depressing! I think it\u2019s going to be a further depressant\non the pool of the people whom we\u2019d like to have serving on boards, those being ones\nthat serve beyond personal interest and with a sense of doing the right things for the\nbenefit of the entire shareholder group.\nWhat happened on those boards that allowed backdating of remuneration (i.e.\noptions) to take place?\nMy sense is many directors just didn\u2019t pay adequate attention, which of course is a\ncapital crime. But, for perspective, let\u2019s just model something together for a minute.\nYou and I are on a compensation committee. In comes a normal proposal for the\naward of options and it\u2019s brought in by a management, whom you have come to\nrespect and with a believed history of ethical management. With them come\nrepresentatives from one of the premier consulting firms who assist management and\ntheir boards on matters around human resources and compensation. They say, \u201cyou\nknow, we would like to go forward with this year\u2019s award to management (or to an\nindividual manager).\u201d Yet, they don\u2019t point out the fact that there is a loophole in\nhow and when one can date the award. Unless we are particularly vigilant and go a\ncouple of levels deep in questioning, we might not ask the right questions that would\nsurface what is really being proposed for approval. Now, if an award has already\nbeen made and someone comes in and says, \u201cwe\u2019d like to change the rules\u201d, that\nshould be infinitely easier to see but, again, one may never know what might get\npassed by on a piece of paper unless carefully read.\n13\nZ\/Papers\/Bernard Rethore Interview\/Bernard Rethore interview \u2013 final 2 - 26\/03\/2009\nIs it the discomfort to challenge or directors being overwhelmed with too much\ndata that has allowed bad practice to continue?\nCollegiality is an important value on a board. Having good working relationships\nwith management is important. But, do I not raise a question because I don\u2019t want to\ndisturb my colleagues? Do I not raise the question because I don\u2019t want to challenge\nmanagement? Probably both dimensions to some degree dull debate. Data overload,\nby comparison, may more be the case in the new world of heightened board concern\nand attention!\nDo you feel that Sarbanes-Oxley has made people more defensive or is Sarbanes-\nOxley pushing people to hold themselves to greater accountability?\nI think Sarbanes-Oxley has done a little of both. Sitting on, over the last years, 4 audit\ncommittees at different times, I have become a reluctant convert to Sarbanes-Oxley,\nas I mentioned earlier. Where at the outset my supposition was that anything that\npassed the United States Senate, 98 to 0, had to be a bad thing, I watched so many\nenterprises in the US having surfaced, not just inefficiencies, but material weaknesses\nin their audit reports that I ended up being supportive of the benefits from Sarbanes-\nOxley.\nMy only caveat would be that it is unfortunate that under Section 404 we must now\ncontinue to have to pay the due bill for that every year going forward. That\u2019s why I\nhope there will be some changes in future. But that aside, boards and audit\ncommittees have been able to use Sarbanes-Oxley as the \u2018ugly gorilla in the corner\u2019\nthat really facilitates getting people to do things they should have been doing better\n14\nZ\/Papers\/Bernard Rethore Interview\/Bernard Rethore interview \u2013 final 2 - 26\/03\/2009\nbefore. So, I\u2019ve become a reluctant believer in the benefits of Sarbanes-Oxley. I\nthink it\u2019s ended up empowering directors.\nWill Sarbanes-Oxley assist the remuneration concerns you have raised?\nMost matters of remuneration are not Sarbanes related. But, we will see -- are already\nseeing -- impact from the new SEC requirements for compensation disclosure in\npublic companies\u2019 proxies, which will be visible with the proxies issued to\nshareholders starting in 2007. The changes are extensive. They are driven by the\nrecognition that CEO pay has simply gotten out of hand.\nSome of this goes all the way back to some of the disclosures that came out of Jack\nWelch\u2019s divorce. His former wife illuminated some of the incredible perks that went\nwith his pension. This was a very acrimonious divorce, as he allegedly began a\nrelationship with one of the editors of Harvard Business Review who worked with\nhim on articles and ultimately his last book. Then, he abruptly moved to divorce his\nwife, who in her own right had been a very successful lawyer, and was having none of\nit. To make sure that the record was clear (and perhaps gain the leverage of public\nopinion in her settlement), she identified things like the availability of private\ncorporate aircraft, the availability of apartments, the allowances for flowers and chefs,\netc. that were part of part of his pension package -- none of which had been\nspecifically disclosed to the public. It was eye opening.\nAnd, prurient interest aside, when one individual in an organization may earn 300 or\n400 times the pay of the average individual in that organization, something is patently\nwrong and in need of correction.\n15\nZ\/Papers\/Bernard Rethore Interview\/Bernard Rethore interview \u2013 final 2 - 26\/03\/2009\nWhat about hedge funds and their growing effect on the market?\nThough I have concerns about the actions of some hedge funds, I guess I am\nlibertarian enough in these matters to be concerned about the thought of regulating\nthem, which is now becoming an issue here in the US. Quickly come the questions\naround: what should the regulation of the hedge fund involve? Part of me\ninstinctively says, stay away from any more governmental intervention. But, if we are\ngoing to have organizations that are indeed unregulated and can bend rules and have\nan adverse influence on other organizations that, by comparison, are pretty keenly\nregulated, then perhaps something needs to be done.\nWith all that we have discussed, where is corporate democracy going?\nI think at the end of the day we are going to see more regulation that facilitates it.\nParties with relative, narrow interests are quite likely going to have greater access to\nthe governance of public companies in the US. And, matters of economic value\ncreation may well be increasingly burdened with elements of political agendas, as\nwell.\nFor instance, various labour unions that have wanted to get access to the governance\nprocess and proxy and clearly they are not doing it simply as shareholders interested\nin the value of their shares. Their policy is to promote greater influence in the board\nroom affecting policy unionisation and issues of interest to unions. There are other\ngroups also with their own agendas, often more political than economic. We even\nhave orders of nuns in the US that have small shareholdings, which they use to argue\nfor (self-)perceived \u2018good causes\u2019 rather than improved economics.\n16\nZ\/Papers\/Bernard Rethore Interview\/Bernard Rethore interview \u2013 final 2 - 26\/03\/2009\nAnd, there are many others who are part of this broad movement for supposed greater\n\u201cdemocracy\u201d. And the media is certainly not pro business in the US. Most important,\nwhat we all face is that the average worker, perhaps living on a household income of\nperhaps $40-50,000 a year, including a wife who also works, trying to educate\nchildren, trying to meet the normal bills, who hears about these people getting these\nzillion $ compensation awards. It makes perfect sense to such an individual to think\nthere is something wrong here -- and there is! So, they want to know why and what\ncan be done to remedy the situation. All of this is part of \u201ccorporate democracy\u201d.\nMay I say thank you so much.\nWord count: 4,155\n"}
