INTRODUCTION\nIn Ginzburg\u2019s original paper in 1957 on ferromagnetic\nsuperconductors, he considered the possibility of supercon-\nductivity in gadolinium produced by outer conduction elec-\ntrons coexisting with magnetism produced by the inner 4 f\nelectrons.1 The relationship between superconductivity and\nmagnetism has been a long-standing issue that has produced\nintensive research into a wide range of complex materials\nfrom those in which the electrons responsible for the magne-\ntism become the superelectrons2,3 to those where, even on\nthe scale of the unit cell, the magnetic ordering is almost\ncompletely spatially separated from the superelectrons.4 Sus-\nceptibility measurements are widely made to investigate the\nmagnetic properties in the normal state and the Curie-Weiss\nlaw used to interpret the data and provide equivalent free-ion\nground-state properties.5 Magnetization measurements are\noften used to find the superconducting parameters.6 Never-\ntheless, specific-heat measurements on magnetic supercon-\nductors are sometimes preferred to susceptibility and mag-\nnetic measurements because they can provide information\nabout both the magnetic contribution and the superconduct-\ning state and are less susceptible to errors associated with\ngranularity and surface or bulk flux pinning. We report here\nthe results of specific-heat measurements in magnetic fields\nup to 15 T on Chevrel phase ~CP! magnetic superconductors\nin the series (Sn12xEux)Mo6S8 . These materials show large\nSchottky magnetic contributions to the specific heat due to\nthe Eu21 ions. Two approximate equations are presented for\ninterpreting specific-heat data that facilitate simple calcula-\ntion of the degenerate ground-state properties ~and the Curie\ntemperature and Curie constant! without advanced computa-\ntion. The magnetic contribution to the total heat capacity of\nthe CP materials is calculated and subtracted so that the size\nand magnetic-field dependence of the superconducting\nspecific-heat jump (Dc) at the superconducting-normal\nphase boundary can be accurately determined. The two inde-\npendent parameters of the Ginzburg-Landau ~GL! theory\n@i.e., the upper critical field (Bc2) and the Ginzburg-Landau\nparameter ~k!#7 are then obtained from Dc for a supercon-\nducting material coexisting with strong magnetism.\nII. FABRICATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nChevrel phase superconductors (MMo6X8 , where M is a\nmetal atom and X a chalcogen! have a crystal structure that is\nalmost isotropic, with the M ion lying in the center of a unit\ncell of comparatively large volume (;278 \u00c53). This crystal\nstructure ensures that the M ions are well separated from the\nconduction electrons and each other, consistent with elec-\ntronic band-structure calculations.4 It leads to magnetic or-\ndering below 10 K, effective Bohr magneton values close to\nthe free ion values and interesting properties such as the\ncoexistence of magnetism and superconductivity at the unit-\ncell level. Samples of the series (Sn12xEux)Mo6S8 with x\n50.00, 0.35, and 0.50 were fabricated under argon at tem-\nperatures up to 1450 \u00b0C and sintered using a hot isostatic\npress operating at 800 \u00b0C and 2000 bars.8 The specific heat\nof these samples was then measured from 3 to 30 K and in\nmagnetic fields up to 15 T.

ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\nFor an antiferromagnetic material with different moments\non two sublattices A and B , the magnetization for sublattice\nA , M A , is given in the mean-field approximation by\nM A5nVgJJmBBJ~J ,yA!, ~1!\nwhere\nyA5gJJmBm0@Hext1D~M A1M B!1lM B# , ~2!\nnv is the density of magnetic ions on one sublattice, gJ is the\nLande\u00b4 g factor, J is the total angular momentum quantum\nnumber, mB is the Bohr magneton, BJ is the Brillouin func-\ntion, m0Hext is the externally applied field. In Eq. ~2!, both\nself-field and exchange terms are included using the factor D\nand the Weiss constant l. In general, D is dependent on\ncrystal structure. For example, if the structure includes dense\ncolumns of ions that are well separated or alternatively dense\nsheets of ions that are well separated, D will tend to be large\nand positive or large and negative, respectively. The classical\nLorentz field gives D51\/3. To simplify the analysis we have\nset D51. Equivalent expressions give the magnetization for\nsublattice B , M B , by swapping the A and B indices. The\nordering temperature is TM\nA 52lC\/2, where C is the Curie\nconstant, given by C5nVgJ\n2J(J11)mB2 m0 \/3kB . For ferro-\nmagnetic materials, sublattices A and B are equivalent and\nthe ordering temperature is TM\nF 5(11l)C . Standard thermo-\ndynamic considerations show that the magnetic contribution\nto the specific heat cm is given by\ncm~Hext ,T !5cm~0,T !2\nT\nr\n]2\n]T2 F2E0Hextm0MdHextGT ,\n~3!\nwhere r can be taken as either the mass or molar density.9\nFigure 2 shows the numerically calculated values of cm as a\nfunction of temperature and applied field for the antiferro-\nmagnetic material EuMo6S8 with the Eu ions in the 21 va-\nlence state and the parameters: J53.5, gJ52.0, nv53.64\n31027 m23 and the ordering temperature TM\nA arbitrarily\nfixed to be 1.5 K. Above the ordering temperature, the mag-\nnitude of the Schottky anomaly increases and then saturates\neven up to very high magnetic fields.\nFigure 3 shows the superconducting and magnetic contri-\nbution for (Sn0.50Eu0.50)Mo6S8 as a function of both tem-\nperature and field, together with the calculated magnetic con-\ntribution ~solid lines!. The zero-field contribution c(0,T) was\nobtained by extrapolating by eye the specific heat from the\ncritical temperature (Tc) down to T50 K and then sub-\ntracted from the total specific heat. This extrapolation only\naffects the values of Bc2 and k obtained at the highest field\nmeasured. At all lower fields, the extrapolation is constrained\nin the region of the jump by measurements of the normal-\nstate properties measured in higher fields ~cf. Fig. 4!. The\ncalculated values were obtained using the free ion values of\nJ and gJ ~i.e., 3.5 and 2, respectively!, a value of nv within\n3% of the nominal composition ~consistent with x-ray data\nshowing almost single-phase material!, and a value of TM\nA\n50.3560.5 K. This value for the ordering temperature is\nconsistent with the range 0.2\u20130.6 K for EuMo6S8 cited in the\nliterature.10 The agreement between calculations and experi-\nment above ;10 K confirms that the Eu21 ions are essen-\ntially free ions. Figure 4 shows the specific heat after the\nmagnetic contribution has been subtracted for the\n(Sn0.65Eu0.35)Mo6S8 and (Sn0.50Eu0.50)Mo6S8 samples. Both\nsamples show a field-independent specific heat above\n;10 K, characteristic of nonmagnetic superconductors in-\ncluding SnMo6S8 .11 The size of the specific-heat jump (Dc)\nFIG. 2. cm as a function of temperature and applied field, cal-\nculated for antiferromagnetic EuMo6S8 with TM\nA 51.5 K, J53.5,\ngJ52.0, and nv53.6431027 m23.\nFIG. 3. c2c(0,T) as a function of temperature and applied field\nfor (Sn0.50Eu0.50)Mo6S8 ; symbols are the experimental data and\nsolid lines are the calculated values.\nNIGEL R.

The\naverage values of k(T) and the normal-state resistivity in-\ncrease systematically as the doping level is increased consis-\ntent with an expected increase in the conduction electron\nscattering rate. The marked improvement in analysis,\nachieved by accurate subtraction of the magnetic back-\nground, shows that k increases as T decreases for both mag-\nnetic samples, which is similar to metallic superconductors.13\nThe data also confirm the very high ~technologically impor-\ntant! values of dBc2 \/dT for these Eu-doped compounds\n(26.1 T K21 for x50.35 and 25.5 T K21 for x50.50) that\nare both larger than the undoped sample (23.9 T K21).\nThe calculations of cm are computationally demanding,\nparticularly if the free parameters J , gJ , nv , and TM are\ncompletely unknown. For antiferromagnetic materials, si-\nmultaneous transcendental equations must be solved numeri-\ncally at an accuracy sufficient to find the integrals and double\nderivatives in Eq. ~3!. We have compared the behavior of the\nSchottky anomalies predicted from the numerical solutions\nwith the heat capacity that follows from a simple approxi-\nmate form for the magnetization M given by\nM5M s tanhS CHextM s~T2u!

Above\nTM the results from both the approximate form and those\ncalculated using the full functional form for M ~Fig. 2! have\nthe same general features. At low fields, the magnitude of the\npeak of the anomaly either increases or decreases with in-\ncreasing field for the antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic\ncase, respectively. Hence there is a significant difference\nfrom the standard analysis of Schottky anomalies that does\nnot consider interacting ions, since this work provides a\nsimple direct interpretation of the increase\/decrease in the\nmagnitude of the peak in the anomaly just above the ordering\ntemperature. This intrinsic behavior for the Schottky\nanomaly above the ordering temperature is not found from\nsimple partition function calculations that consider noninter-\nacting ions. In high fields, a saturation in the peak value of\nthe Schottky anomaly is found. From Eq. ~5! analytic forms\nfor the field-temperature dependence ~i.e., m0Hext\npeak vs Tpeak)\nand for the saturation value (cmsat) of the peak can be calcu-\nlated of the form\nm0Hext\npeak5\n6.54\ngJ~J11 !\n~Tpeak2u!, ~6!\ncm\nsat51.12\nncellRJ\n~J11 ! , ~7!\nwhere R is the molar gas constant.

We have successfully used this\napproach to model the specific heat above 3 K of a\n(Pb,Gd)Mo6S8 superconductor (TMA <1 K) with\n;6% Gd2S3 magnetic second phase (TMA 55.5 K).11\nWe have analyzed the Schottky anomalies in the literature\nfor the 1-2-3 high-temperature superconductors\nYbBa2Cu3O7 , ErBa2Cu3O7 , and DyBa2Cu3O7 ~Ref. 14! us-\ning Eqs. ~6! and ~7!, and derived the values of gJ(J11) and\nJ shown in Table I. The values of gJ(J11) are in reasonable\nagreement with free ion values. The magnitude of the peak\nvalue of the heat capacity at the Schottky anomaly for these\nmaterials increases with increasing field ~above the ordering\ntemperature! indicating antiferromagnetic ordering at low\ntemperatures. The calculated values of J are all close to 0.5,\nindicative of the ground state of the rare-earth ions in these\ncompounds being a doublet state. These observations are\nconsistent with neutron-diffraction measurements on\nErBa2Cu3O7 that show a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic\ndoublet ground state.14\nIV. CONCLUSION\nWe conclude that the ground-state properties of a mag-\nnetic system can be deduced from specific-heat data using\nthe two approximate equations provided @Eqs. ~6! and ~7!#\nand that the increasing or decreasing magnitude of the\nSchottky anomaly above the ordering temperature used to\nindicate antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic ordering, respec-\ntively. Hence the magnetic contribution can be calculated for\nboth single and multiphase compounds, which is necessary\nfor accurately determining Bc2 and k in strongly magnetic\nsuperconductors.\n1 V. L.
