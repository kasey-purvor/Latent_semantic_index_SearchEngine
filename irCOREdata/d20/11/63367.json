In the case of aphids these natural enemies\n30 (aphidophages) include specialist and generalist predators, parasitoids and pathogens\n31 (Vo\u00a8lkl et al. 2007). Together they represent a \u2018guild\u2019, i.e., a community of species that\n32 share the same host\/prey resource (Polis et al. 1989; Rosenheim et al. 1995). As aphids are\n33 often pests in managed ecosystems these natural enemies provide a valuable pest man-\n34 agement ecosystem service that can be manipulated within biological control strategies\n35 (e.g., Barbosa 1998; Gurr et al. 2004; Losey and Vaughan 2006; Powell and Pell 2007; Pell\n36 2008).\n37 Different \u2018predator\u2019 taxa play different ecological roles within the guild (Rosenheim\n38 et al. 2004a). \u2018Intermediate predators\u2019 function from the third trophic level suppressing\n39 herbivores, whereas \u2018top predators\u2019 mainly operate from the fourth trophic level sup-\n40 pressing \u2018intermediate predators\u2019 and, consequently, releasing herbivore populations from\n41 control (Polis 1994; Rosenheim 1998). Intraguild predation occurs when one of two spe-\n42 cies competing for the same host\/prey also consumes its competitor, and can be a strong\n43 force structuring communities. Omnivorous intraguild predation can be asymmetric when\n44 one of the two species (the intraguild predator) always preys on the other (the intraguild\n45 prey), or symmetric when both species prey on each other to a greater or lesser extent\n46 (Polis et al. 1989; Polis and Holt 1992; Rosenheim et al. 1995). The intraguild predator\n47 benefits not only from the nutritive value of the meal, but also from the removal of a\n48 competitor. Coincidental intraguild predation occurs when a parasitoid or pathogen is\n49 consumed while still developing within its herbivore host and, in this case, the herbivore\n50 and the intraguild prey are directly linked (Polis et al. 1989). Intraguild predators function\n51 as both \u2018intermediate\u2019 and \u2018top predators\u2019 by feeding on both herbivores and \u2018intermediate\n52 predators\u2019.\n53 The impact of intraguild predation on community structure and diversity can be\n54 extremely variable, complex and difficult to predict (Rosenheim et al. 2004a; Snyder and\n55 Evans 2006; Straub et al. 2008). Many studies have assessed the prevalence of intraguild\n56 predation in aphidophagous guilds (Polis et al. 1989; Rosenheim et al. 1995; Holt and\n57 Polis 1997; Mu\u00a8ller and Brodeur 2002; Lucas 2005; Pell 2008) and reported it to be a\n58 widespread phenomenon with implications for both predator diversity within the guild and\n59 the pest management ecosystem services that the guild delivers.\n60 As an effective generalist predator of aphids and other hemipteran pests Harmonia\n61 axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) has been widely and repeatedly augmented or\n62 introduced for biological control. As such, it has contributed significantly to pest sup-\n63 pression in a wide variety of managed ecosystems including pecan, apple, sweet corn,\n64 alfalfa, cotton, tobacco, wheat and soybean (Tedders and Schaefer 1994; Buntin and\n65 Bouton 1997; Brown and Miller 1998; Colunga-Garcia and Gage 1998; Wells and\n66 McPherson 1999; Wells et al. 2001; Musser and Shelton 2003; Koch 2003; Majerus et al.\n67 2006; Roy et al. 2006). However, the very functional traits that have made H. axyridis an\n68 effective biological control agent, also implicate it as an intraguild predator that poses\n69 significant risk to the diversity of other natural enemies of Hemiptera and their ecosystem\n70 services. Although natural enemy diversity in its native range remains relatively stable in\n71 the presence of H. axyridis (Kuznetsov 1988, 1997), wherever it has established after\n72 introduction as an exotic species, it has been associated with declines in native natural\n73 enemies, particularly native coccinellids (Majerus et al. 2006; Roy et al. 2006; Snyder and\n74 Evans 2006). These declines have been attributed to direct interspecific competition for\n75 resources with less competitive\/fecund natural enemies (Michaud 2002) but are also likely\n76 to be strongly influenced by its role as an intraguild predator.\nJ.

Pell et al.\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 10-10-2007 Pages : 22\nArticle No. : 9125 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO632 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n77 There are a number of functional traits that determine the nature, symmetry and\n78 outcome of intraguild predation including: relative size (incidence of mortality is often\n79 inversely correlated with size) (Majerus 1994; Evans 2000), aggressive strategies and\n80 mandibular structure (Yasuda et al. 2001), degree of feeding and habitat specificity,\n81 mobility (sessile stages are particularly vulnerable), defence strategies and abundance of\n82 extraguild prey (Polis et al. 1989; Lucas et al. 1998; Roy et al. 2006; Straub et al. 2008).\n83 In this paper we will specifically review the existing, largely experimental, data on these\n84 traits for H. axyridis, and discuss their strength and symmetry both within its native guild\n85 and within exotic guilds where it has established as an invasive alien. We will use these\n86 studies to interpret the observed population declines in natural enemy diversity in the field,\n87 predict species at risk in regions not yet invaded and consider implications for resulting\n88 ecosystem services. We will also identify gaps in our knowledge that require further study\n89 in order to identify opportunities for mitigation.\n90 Current knowledge\n91 Intraguild predation between H. axyridis and coccinellids of other species\n92 Eggs\n93 The relative size and mobility of the intraguild predator and prey are known to influence\n94 the outcome of intraguild predation, both showing an inverse correlation with the incidence\n95 of mortality (Huey and Pianka 1981; Sengonca and Frings 1985; Rosenheim et al. 1995;\n96 Lucas et al. 1998). In coccinellids this equates to the immature stages being more\n97 vulnerable than adults, and eggs being particularly threatened (Sato and Dixon 2004;\n98 Cottrell 2007).\n99 Harmonia axyridis adults and larvae find eggs of many insect species acceptable as\n100 prey; laboratory stocks are often maintained on eggs of the Mediterranean flour moth,\n101 Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) (Berkvens et al. 2008). Cottrell (2004)\n102 reports that H. axyridis adults attacked eggs of Coleomegilla maculata (De Geer)\n103 (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Olla v-nigrum (Mulsant) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) more\n104 frequently than adults of these species attacked H. axyridis eggs, and attest that intraguild\n105 predation of eggs is a serious threat for these species. However, cannibalism and predation\n106 of coccinellid eggs are most often associated with larval stages (Dixon 2000; Cottrell 2007)\n107 and, for some species, may be affected by the relative abundance of extraguild prey (Sato\n108 et al. 2003); at low aphid or coccid densities, coccinellid larvae are more likely to engage\n109 in cannibalism or intraguild predation. In addition, the tendency for intraguild predation by\n110 larvae varies between species both as intraguild predators and intraguild prey. Cannibalism\n111 and intraguild predation by H. axyridis are commonly observed, both in the laboratory and\n112 the field, even when aphids or coccids are abundant (M.E.N. Majerus and R.L. Ware\n113 personal observation). A recent study concluded that H. axyridis larvae were more likely to\n114 engage in intraguild predation of the eggs of C. maculata, Cycloneda munda (Say)\n115 (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Hippodamia convergens Gue\u00b4rin-Me\u00b4neville (Coleoptera:\n116 Coccinellidae) and O. v-nigrum than for H. axyridis eggs to be the intraguild prey of the\n117 larvae of these species (Cottrell 2007). This is in agreement with previous work of Cottrell\n118 (2004) demonstrating that neither C. maculata nor O. v-nigrum larvae can complete\n119 development on H. axyridis eggs whereas H. axyridis can complete development on a diet\n120 of either C. maculata or O. v-nigrum eggs.\nIntraguild predation involving H. axyridis\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 10-10-2007 Pages : 22\nArticle No. : 9125 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO632 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n121 Defensive adaptations (chemical or physical) are often effective in reducing the\n122 susceptibility of sessile life stages, such as eggs, prepupae and pupae to intraguild pre-\n123 dation and cannibalism. The chemical defences of coccinellid eggs have been well studied\n124 (Agarwala and Dixon 1992; Hemptinne and Dixon 2000). Indeed, while intrinsic toxicity\n125 or unpalatability is governed by de novo synthesis of species-specific alkaloids (Pasteels\n126 et al. 1973; King and Meinwald 1996), Hemptinne and Dixon (2000) demonstrated the\n127 existence of extrinsic chemicals on the surface of some species\u2019 eggs that act as deterrents\n128 against intraguild predation. Ware et al. (2008b) have recently discussed the role of\n129 surface deterrents on eggs of the European species Calvia 14-guttata (L.) (Coleoptera:\n130 Coccinellidae) as a defence against intraguild predation by H. axyridis. A similar\n131 phenomenon has been speculated for the eggs of the Japanese species Eocaria muiri\n132 Timberlake (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) (Ware et al. 2008a). The defensive chemistry of\n133 H. axyridis eggs themselves has been implicated as pivotal to the observed resistance of\n134 H. axyridis eggs to predation by other aphidophages that appear to find them unpalatable\n135 (Alam et al. 2002; Sato and Dixon 2004). Interestingly, similar alkanes to those found on\n136 the surface of H. axyridis eggs are also present in larval tracks and act as oviposition\n137 deterring semiochemicals for other ladybirds, thus reducing egg cannibalism and intraguild\n138 predation (Magro et al. 2007).\n139 Larvae and pupae\n140 Ware and Majerus (2008) have comprehensively examined intraguild predation of\n141 immature stages of British and Japanese coccinellids by H. axyridis. A total of 12 species\n142 of coccinellid (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) were included in this laboratory study: eight\n143 derived from British populations (Coccinella 7-punctata L., Adalia 2-punctata (L.), Adalia\n144 10-punctata (L.), Propylea 14-punctata (L.), C. 14-guttata, Anatis ocellata (L.), Harmonia\n145 4-punctata (Pontoppidan), Coccinella 5-punctata L.) and four from Japanese populations\n146 (Coccinella 7-punctata brucki Mulsant, Cheilomenes 6-maculatus (Fabricius), Propylea\n147 japonica Thunberg and E. muiri). In general, H. axyridis was an intraguild predator of all\n148 species, with the exception of A. ocellata. The important conclusions of this study were\n149 that there was no obvious difference between the susceptibilities of Japanese and British\n150 coccinellids to intraguild predation by H. axyridis, and intraguild predation by H. axyridis\n151 represents a serious threat for many species in Britain (Ware and Majerus 2008).\n152 The relatively large size of H. axyridis throughout its life cycle undoubtedly contributes\n153 to its success as an intraguild predator following the \u2018size matters\u2019 hypothesis. In predatory\n154 interactions between coccinellid larvae it is generally the larger that eats the smaller,\n155 assuming both are mobile (Majerus 1994). Notably, in comparative tests between fourth\n156 instar larvae of H. 4-punctata, H. axyridis and A. ocellata, which have similar behavioural\n157 and physical defences, the level of intraguild predation was directly correlated to size. Larvae\n158 of the largest species, A. ocellata, won the majority of encounters withH. axyridis, while the\n159 smallest species, H. 4-punctata, lost most such encounters (Ware and Majerus 2008).\n160 There are few reports of other larval coccinellids successfully attacking H. axyridis, and\n161 most evidence suggests that the immature stages of H. axyridis are resistant to reciprocal\n162 attacks. In a laboratory study assessing the interactions between H. axyridis and\n163 C. 7-punctata, Yasuda et al. (2001) attributed the greater success of the former to its higher\n164 attack rates and greater escape ability. Recent research is beginning to confirm the importance\n165 of chemical defence ofH. axyridis larvae as ameans of preventing counter-attacks (Ware and\n166 Majerus 2008), and larvae are known to produce similar defensive alkaloids to those present\nJ. K. Pell et al.\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 10-10-2007 Pages : 22\nArticle No. : 9125 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO632 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n167 within eggs and released by adults (Pasteels et al. 1973; King and Meinwald 1996). Further\n168 studies have also implicated the role of superior physical defences (spines rather than hairs) in\n169 larval stages of H. axyridis compared to other species (Ware and Majerus 2008).\n170 In the field, coccinellid larvae tend to disperse from a plant when prey abundance is low\n171 (Sato 2001) and this reduces the incidence of cannibalism and intraguild predation by\n172 larger larvae and adults (Sato et al. 2003). However, emigration is a precarious strategy for\n173 an immature coccinellid, so there is a trade-off between emigrating or remaining on a plant\n174 with a low prey density and risking cannibalism or intraguild predation. Harmonia axyridis\n175 commonly co-occurs with C. 7-punctata brucki and P. japonica in their native Japanese\n176 range (Yasuda and Shinya 1997; Sato 2001). In a Japanese field study of these three\n177 coccinellid species co-occurring on shrubs both C. 7-punctata brucki and H. axyridis\n178 larvae emigrated in response to low prey density whereas P. japonica larvae did not (Sato\n179 2001). The prevalence of intraguild predation and cannibalism of C. 7-punctata brucki and\n180 H. axyridis larvae was low whereas no P. japonica larvae completed their development on\n181 the shrubs and this was assumed to be as a consequence of intraguild predation. In further\n182 studies it was confirmed that the early emigration of C. 7-punctata brucki larvae enabled\n183 them to escape from intraguild predation by H. axyridis larvae (Sato et al. 2003) and that\n184 the late emigration of P. japonica larvae accounted for the high incidence of intraguild\n185 predation by H. axyridis larvae (Sato et al. 2003).\n186 Propylea japonica is also a smaller species than either H. axyridis or C. 7-punctata\n187 brucki and so this further supports the hypothesis that \u2018size matters\u2019 in intraguild predation.\n188 Ware and Majerus (2008) also report P. japonica larvae as highly palatable intraguild prey\n189 with little physical defence from attack by H. axyridis. It is interesting to note from field\n190 studies in Japan that C. 7-punctata brucki are active earlier in the spring than H. axyridis\n191 (Takahashi and Naito 1984; Sato 2001). Therefore, H. axyridis are more likely to expe-\n192 rience a scarcity of aphids, which are abundant in spring and early summer, than\n193 C. 7-punctata brucki. Consequently, H. axyridis is likely to be more reliant on intraguild\n194 prey to complete their development than is C. 7-punctata brucki (Sato et al. 2003).\n195 Adults\n196 Adult coccinellids are generally less susceptible to predation than immature stages due to\n197 their protective elytra and aposematic colour patterns (Majerus 1994). However, they are\n198 exposed to a particularly vulnerable period just after eclosion, when their elytra are still\n199 soft. Ware and Majerus (2008) report observations of attacks made on eclosing or newly\n200 eclosed adults by larvae, when no other food was available. Fourth instar H. axyridis larvae\n201 were observed to attack and consume new adults of A. 10-punctata, A. ocellata,\n202 C. 14-guttata, C. 7-punctata brucki and E. muiri, after not having attacked them as pupae\n203 (Ware and Majerus 2008). However, the consumption of newly eclosed H. axyridis adults\n204 was rare, and only performed by conspecific larvae and larvae of the congeneric species\n205 H. 4-punctata. This supports the speculation that the defensive chemistry of H. axyridis\n206 adults may make them unpalatable to other coccinellids (Hough-Goldstein et al. 1996).\n207 Intraguild predation between H. axyridis and non-coccinellid predators\n208 Coccinellids are common within aphidophagous guilds and most studies considering the\n209 role of H. axyridis as an intraguild predator have focussed on interactions within the\nIntraguild predation involving H. axyridis\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 10-10-2007 Pages : 22\nArticle No. : 9125 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO632 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n210 Coccinellidae. However, H. axyridis interacts with many other predatory insects at the\n211 community level. Lacewings (Neuroptera) are both abundant as aphid predators in natural\n212 systems, and as components of biological control strategies. In a laboratory study,\n213 Phoofolo and Obrycki (1998) demonstrated that there was no difference in the develop-\n214 ment time or survival of H. axyridis (and also C. maculata) fed on a diet of pea aphids,\n215 Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), or eggs of the lacewing,\n216 Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae). In contrast, C. carnea was\n217 unable to develop successfully when fed on H. axyridis eggs.\n218 A further study examined the interactions between adult H. axyridis, C. carnea and the\n219 gall midge Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) in the presence of\n220 the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumara (Hemiptera: Aphididae), in microcosms and\n221 field cages (Gardiner and Landis 2007). Harmonia axyridis engaged in intraguild predation\n222 with both C. carnea and A. aphidimyza and was predicted to contribute to declines in both\n223 species in the field. Phoofolo and Obrycki (1998) and Gardiner and Landis (2007) both\n224 suggested the potential for H. axyridis to be an asymmetrical intraguild predator of\n225 C. carnea. However, C. carnea will consume H. axyridis eggs (Phoofolo and Obrycki\n226 1998) and recent observations by Fremlin (2007) indicate that C. carnea will also attack\n227 H. axyridis pupae. Therefore, the interaction can be considered to be (weakly) symmet-\n228 rical. Further research is required to expand our knowledge on interactions between\n229 neuropterans and H. axyridis.\n230 The spined soldier bug, Podisus maculiventris Say (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) is\n231 native to North America and has a broad prey range including over 100 species of insect,\n232 primarily soft-bodied, slow-moving larvae of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, but also aphids\n233 (McPherson 1980; Herrick and Reitz 2004). Half of the species on which it preys\n234 are important crop pests (Herrick and Reitz 2004). Podisus maculiventris is therefore\n235 loosely linked with many trophic guilds, including that of aphids (McPherson 1980;\n236 Hough-Goldstein et al. 1996), and four species of predaceous coccinellid are listed as prey\n237 to this predatory bug (McPherson 1980). In laboratory studies, Hough-Goldstein et al.\n238 (1996) demonstrated that although P. maculiventris did not consume adult H. axyridis they\n239 did consume H. axyridis larvae in \u2018no choice\u2019 treatments. In this study, H. axyridis larvae\n240 were described as \u2018aggressive\u2019 and often noted to escape predation, whereas adult\n241 H. axyridis were rejected, presumably as unpalatable, by P. maculiventris. Indeed,\n242 P. maculiventris took four times longer to capture H. axyridis larvae compared to Spo-\n243 doptera frugiperda Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae (Hough-Goldstein et al. 1996).\n244 A further study demonstrated that interactions between P. maculiventris and H. axyridis\n245 in the presence or absence of extraguild prey (Spodoptera littoralis Boisduval (Lepidop-\n246 tera: Noctuidae) or Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae)) were asymmetric in\n247 favour of the bug (De Clercq et al. 2003). Podisus maculiventris fed on H. axyridis eggs\n248 and larvae but rarely on adults. As with interactions amongst coccinellids, this interaction\n249 was dependent on the life stage of the bug; fourth instar nymphs and adults were more\n250 aggressive in their interactions than second instars nymphs. In contrast, H. axyridis rarely\n251 attacked P. maculiventris. Intraguild predation by P. maculiventris on H. axyridis was\n252 reduced in the presence of S. littoralis but not M. persicae. De Clercq et al. (2003)\n253 interpreted this to infer that H. axyridis was a less preferred prey in comparison to\n254 S. littoralis and this was supported by the longer development time of the bug when fed on\n255 H. axyridis larvae compared to S. littoralis. There was a slight difference in the survival to\n256 adulthood of pentatomid nymphs fed on H. axyridis compared to S. littoralis (70% vs.\n257 80\u201390% respectively) and no nymphs reached adulthood when fed on just aphids\n258 (De Clercq et al. 2003).\nJ.

In contrast to the\n262 literature on intraguild predation between H. axyridis and other predators, particularly\n263 coccinellids, there is very little information on such interactions between H. axyridis and\n264 parasitoids. Previous studies have reported the consumption of parasitized aphids by\n265 coccinellids (Wheeler et al. 1968; Ferguson and Stiling, 1996) and that the presence, or\n266 recent activity, of predatory coccinellids within an aphid colony can reduce the oviposition\n267 rate of aphid parasitoids (Taylor et al. 1998).\n268 Takizawa et al. (2000) assessed whether the aphid Aphis craccivora Koch (Hemiptera:\n269 Aphididae), parasitized by Aphidius colemani Viereck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), were\n270 suitable prey for three coccinellid species: C. 7-punctata, P. japonica and H. axyridis. The\n271 parasitoid was used at two life stages: 3-day-old larvae within living aphids (coincidental\n272 intraguild predation) and sessile aphid \u2018mummies\u2019 containing pupae (asymmetrical\n273 omnivorous intraguild predation). Consumption of parasitized aphids containing 3-day-old\n274 larvae did not reduce survival or increase development time of any of the coccinellids. In\n275 contrast, consumption of aphid \u2018mummies\u2019 increased the development time of all three\n276 species and reduced survival to adulthood of C. 7-punctata by 70% but did not affect the\n277 survival of H. axyridis and P. japonica. Coccinella 7-punctata is considered to be a more\n278 aphid-specific predator than H. axyridis (Hodek and Honek 1988). It is likely that para-\n279 sitized \u2018mummies\u2019 are unsuitable prey and, hence, the low survival rates of C. 7-punctata\n280 fed on parasitized aphids could be attributed to their aphid-specific dietary requirements\n281 (Takizawa et al. 2000). In contrast, H. axyridis selectively preyed on pea aphids, A. pisum,\n282 rather than pea aphid \u2018mummies\u2019 parasitized by Aphidius ervi Haliday (Hymenoptera:\n283 Braconidae) (Snyder and Ives 2003). Although this would not change the impact of\n284 coincidental intraguild predation of larval parasitoids by H. axyridis, it does demonstrate\n285 that interactions are variable depending on the prey concerned. Similarly, in a study at\n286 larger spatial scales Snyder et al. (2004a) found that although H. axyridis did prey on\n287 \u2018mummies\u2019 of the aphid parasitoid Aphelinus asychis Walker (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae)\n288 (adult H. axyridis showed no discrimination between \u2018mummies\u2019 and aphids although\n289 larvae preferred aphids in feeding trials), the overall parasitism level was not affected.\n290 Intraguild predation between H. axyridis and pathogens\n291 Entomopathogenic fungi are common pathogens of aphids and can be involved in both\n292 coincidental and omnivorous, asymmetrical or symmetrical, intraguild interactions (Roy\n293 and Pell 2000; Vo\u00a8lkl et al. 2007). The most common fungal pathogens are host-specific\n294 species from the Zygomycetes, order Entomophthorales, although other species from the\n295 Ascomycetes, order Hypocreales, some with wide host ranges, are used as biopesticides\n296 and could, therefore, be involved in intraguild interactions (Powell and Pell 2007; Pell\n297 2008).\n298 During the final stages of infection by entomopathogenic fungi the host dies and the\n299 fungus sporulates to produce more infective propagules (conidia) for transmission (Inglis\n300 et al. 2001; Pell et al. 2001). As the sporulating aphid cadaver is sessile, it is an easy prey\n301 item for generalist predators. In a laboratory study, Roy et al. (2008a) assessed the pre-\n302 dation of aphid cadavers sporulating with Pandora neoaphidis (Remaudie`re and\n303 Hennebert) Humber (Zygomycetes: Entomophthorales) by UK and Japanese-derived\nIntraguild predation involving H. axyridis\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 10-10-2007 Pages : 22\nArticle No. : 9125 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO632 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n304 H. axyridis relative to that of the UK native species C. 7-punctata. Unlike C. 7-punctata,\n305 which showed a strong preference for aphids over sporulating fungal cadavers, H. axyridis\n306 showed little discrimination between the prey types and would consume whole, sporulating\n307 cadavers. The consumption of whole sporulating cadavers could remove a significant\n308 quantity of inoculum from the aphid population, which may result in a reduction in further\n309 transmission. As P. neoaphidis only infects aphids, this represents asymmetrical intraguild\n310 predation. The strength of intraguild predation by H. axyridis collected in the UK differed\n311 from those collected in Japan, with H. axyridis (UK) showing less discrimination between\n312 prey types compared to H. axyridis (Japan) (Roy et al. 2008a). Whether feeding on\n313 infected cadavers has fitness consequences for H. axyridis is unknown.\n314 Other entomopathogenic fungi have wider host ranges and may be infective\n315 towards both coccinellids and aphids, making the intraguild interaction potentially\n316 symmetrical. For example, isolates of the entomopathogenic fungi Metarhizium\n317 anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin (Ascomycete: Hypocreales), Paecilomyces fumos-\n318 oroseus (Wise) Brown and Smith (Ascomycetes: Hypocreales) and Beauveria bassiana\n319 (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Ascomycetes: Hypocreales) have been recorded infecting both\n320 aphids and coccinellids (e.g., Magalhaes et al. 1988; Keller and Zimmerman 1989; Butt\n321 et al. 1994; James and Lighthart 1994; Yeo 2000; Pell and Vandenberg 2002; Ormond\n322 et al. 2006). In particular, B. bassiana is a major overwintering mortality agent of\n323 C. 7-punctata (Majerus 1994; Ormond et al. 2006). Roy et al. (2008b) assessed the\n324 susceptibility of H. axyridis derived from the UK and Japan to B. bassiana relative to\n325 that of the UK native species C. 7-punctata and A. 2-punctata. Only doses of 109 conidia\n326 ml\u20131 resulted in mortality of H. axyridis, in contrast, 80% of C. 7-punctata and 70% of\n327 A. 2-punctata exposed to 107 conidia ml\u20131 of B. bassiana succumbed to infection. In\n328 addition, the results suggested that the UK derived strain may be more resistant to\n329 infection than the Japanese derived strain. Interestingly, inoculation with B. bassiana at a\n330 concentration as low as 105 conidia ml\u20131 reduced the fecundity of H. axyridis (Roy et al.\n331 2008b). Whether any of these coccinellids feed on B. bassiana-infected cadavers and the\n332 implications of this on the symmetry of intraguild predation is unknown. However, in the\n333 study of Pell and Vandenberg (2002) the coccinellid H. convergens did consume living\n334 Diuraphis noxia Kurdjumov (Hemiptera: Aphididae) aphids infected by P. fumosoroseus\n335 but did not consume sporulating aphid cadavers.\n336 In both studies by Roy et al. (2008a, b), the interactions involving H. axyridis collected\n337 from the UK differed from those collected in Japan, with H. axyridis from the UK being a\n338 stronger intraguild predator of P. neoaphidis and more resistant to B. bassiana than the\n339 strain from Japan. These are the first studies to indicate fundamental differences between\n340 H. axyridis subpopulations and demonstrate the importance of assessing genetic and\n341 ecological variability amongst such subpopulations.\n342 Intraguild predation involving H. axyridis: Conclusions to date\n343 There is broad agreement, from the studies described above, that H. axyridis is a top\n344 predator as it is predominantly a strong asymmetrical intraguild predator of other guild\n345 members (Hironori and Katsuhiro 1997; Cottrell and Yeargan 1998; Phoofolo and Obrycki\n346 1998; Yasuda and Ohnuma 1999; Michaud 2002; Sato et al. 2003, 2005; Felix and Soares\n347 2004; Snyder et al. 2004b; Kajita et al., 2006; Perez and Omkar 2006; Roy et al. 2006,\n348 2008a, b; Cottrell 2007; Ware and Majerus 2008) and as such can dominate in aggressive\n349 intraguild interactions and lead to a decline in guild diversity.\nJ. K. Pell et al.\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 10-10-2007 Pages : 22\nArticle No. : 9125 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO632 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n350 The key functional traits that make H. axyridis such an exceptional intraguild predator\n351 are its relatively large size, aggressive behaviour, extreme polyphagy and the possession of\n352 effective physical and chemical defence strategies. Together these traits provide the\n353 mechanism by which H. axyridis impacts on guilds and food webs in general (Tedders and\n354 Schaefer 1994; Hodek 1996; Yasuda and Shinya 1997; Yasuda and Ohnuma 1999; Kajita\n355 et al. 2000; Koch 2003). It therefore seems likely that H. axyridis could disrupt\n356 aphidophagous\/coccidophagous community structure leading to declines in other species in\n357 the guild where it establishes as a non-native species. Harmonia axyridis has certainly\n358 become abundant and widely distributed as a non-native species throughout North America\n359 and Europe (Koch 2003; Brown et al. 2008) and field data from the USA has reported\n360 associated negative impacts on native coccinellid species in these regions (Elliott et al.\n361 1996; LaMana and Miller 1996; Brown and Miller 1998; Colunga-Garcia and Gage 1998;\n362 Lucas et al. 2002; Michaud 2002; Nault and Kennedy 2003). Interestingly, C. 7-punctata\n363 was also introduced and became established widely in North America prior to the estab-\n364 lishment of H. axyridis (Gordon 1985). It too displaced native coccinellids and became the\n365 dominant predator. However, H. axyridis is a more aggressive predator than C. 7-punctata;\n366 larvae of H. axyridis consume those of C. 7-punctata but the reverse occurs considerably\n367 less frequently (Hironori and Katsuhiro 1997; Yasuda et al. 2004; Ware and Majerus\n368 2008). Since the arrival of H. axyridis in the USA, it has displaced C. 7-punctata as the\n369 \u2018top predator\u2019 demonstrating the considerable dominance of H. axyridis as an intraguild\n370 predator of native and exotic coccinellids alike (Snyder et al. 2004b).\n371 Similar evidence of declines in native coccinellid species after establishment of\n372 H. axyridis is accumulating in Europe. For example, evidence suggests that in London\n373 numbers of some, but not all, native coccinellids (particularly A. 2-punctata) have declined\n374 significantly since the arrival of H. axyridis in 2004 (Majerus, unpublished data). This is\n375 almost certainly due to its superior competitive ability and status as an intraguild predator.\n376 From the experimental studies of Ware and Majerus (2008), with consideration of the\n377 wider ecologies of H. axyridis and British ladybirds, and in the absence of control or\n378 mitigation, we anticipate that aphidophagous habitat generalists such as C. 7-punctata,\n379 A. 2-punctata and P. 14-punctata will be most at risk from the establishment of\n380 H. axyridis in the UK, followed by aphidophagous habitat specialists such as Myzia\n381 oblongoguttata (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Myrrha 18-guttata (L.) (Coleoptera:\n382 Coccinellidae) and Anisosticta 19-punctata (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). The only\n383 species that may be relatively unaffected by invasive H. axyridis is A. ocellata, and indeed\n384 H. axyridis could actually be at risk from detrimental interactions with this species where\n385 they co-inhabit coniferous woodland. It is thought that the aphidophagous specialist\n386 C. 5-punctata would be particularly threatened if H. axyridis invades unstable river\n387 shingle, as it is already considered of conservation concern (Ware et al. 2005). Coccido-\n388 phagous species such as Exochomus 4-pustulatus (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and\n389 Chilocorus renipustulatus (Scriba) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and the Erica\/Calluna\n390 heathland specialists Chilocorus 2-pustulatus (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and\n391 Coccinella hieroglyphica L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) are thought to be less at risk, the\n392 latter because H. axyridis has yet to be recorded from such heathland. Mycophagous,\n393 phytophagous and myrmecophilous coccinellids, such as Thea 22-punctata (L.) (Coleop-\n394 tera: Coccinellidae), Subcoccinella 24-punctata (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and\n395 Coccinella magnifica Redtenbacher (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) respectively, are likely to\n396 be the least threatened by the establishment of H. axyridis in Britain.\n397 There is clear evidence for declines in diversity of coccinellids in the USA and\n398 increasingly in Europe. However, there have been no studies to evaluate impacts on the\nIntraguild predation involving H. axyridis\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 10-10-2007 Pages : 22\nArticle No. : 9125 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO632 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n399 diversity of other guild members or on biodiversity more widely; these are urgently\n400 required, particularly in areas undergoing invasion by H. axyridis, if the full implications\n401 of its presence are to be evaluated.\n402 Knowledge gaps, future perspectives and implications for biodiversity\n403 and ecosystem function\n404 Harmonia axyridis is also a dominant intraguild predator in its native range, as shown by\n405 Ware and Majerus (2008) who paired Japanese H. axyridis with Japanese native coccin-\n406 ellids in their laboratory interaction studies and found that H. axyridis was the successful\n407 intraguild predator in the majority of cases. It has also prevented the establishment of the\n408 introduced coccinellid A. 2-punctata in Japan (Sakuratani et al. 2000; Kajita et al. 2006).\n409 However, it appears to co-exist with most other guild members (Kuznetsov 1997) whilst\n410 causing declines and competitive exclusion of other coccinellid species in regions where it\n411 is an invasive exotic (e.g., Colunga-Garcia and Gage 1998; Michaud 2002). In co-evolved\n412 communities that utilise limited resources, species will be under selection to either ensure\n413 that they win any competitive interaction or that they avoid competition through resource-\n414 use complementarity and niche differentiation (Wilby and Thomas 2002a, b; Pell 2008). It\n415 is possible that, although H. axyridis is the top predator in its native range, other predator\n416 populations can escape intraguild predation through spatial or temporal niche differenti-\n417 ation. Studies to understand the mechanisms for co-existence with H. axyridis in its native\n418 range are essential if we are to mitigate existing effects in its invasive range.\n419 Temporal niche differentiation\n420 The co-existence of H. axyridis and sympatric species in Asia may, in part, be due to\n421 phenological differences that lead to temporal niche differentiation. For example,\n422 C. 7-punctata brucki is active earlier in the spring in Japan than H. axyridis and its larvae\n423 are therefore larger and more able to survive in intraguild combat with H. axyridis\n424 (Takahashi and Naito 1984; Sato 2001). Phenological studies of H. axyridis in its non-\n425 native range are essential if we are to predict the extent of intraguild predation and\n426 consequent impacts on biodiversity. Such studies are underway and in the UK, for\n427 example, early indications are that H. axyridis emerges from winter in synchrony with\n428 most native aphidophagous coccinellids, which contributes to the latter\u2019s inability to\n429 escape intraguild predation. Harmonia axyridis is also multivoltine and remains active for\n430 longer through the season, allowing numbers of individuals to build up rapidly. All life\n431 stages of H. axyridis have been recorded in November (early winter) in the UK (Majerus\n432 et al. 2006; Brown et al. 2008). In one study from the USA biological control literature,\n433 Flowers et al. (2006) considered intraguild interactions amongst three exotic predators\n434 attacking the hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae (Annand) (Hemiptera: Adelgidae) in\n435 hemlock stands in West Virginia. The species included were: specialists, Laricobius\n436 nigrinus (Fender) (Coleoptera: Derodontidae) and the coccinellid Sasajiscymnus tsugae\n437 (Sasaji & McClure) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and the generalist H. axyridis. The\n438 authors concluded that intraguild predation by H. axyridis was not common because they\n439 were phenologically separated and active during different seasons; L. nigrinus was most\n440 active in spring and H. axyridis in summer. This also has implications for the wider guild\n441 beyond other coccinellids, for which there is currently very little information.\nJ. K.

Although there are limited studies on myrmecophilous\n445 interactions in the native range of H. axyridis, it is well documented for some coccinellid\n446 species in Europe. Many aphids and coccids are myrmecophilous and gain benefits from\n447 being associated with ants, including protection from natural enemies, in exchange for food\n448 in the form of honeydew (e.g., Ho\u00a8lldobler and Wilson 1990; Jiggins et al. 1993; Majerus\n449 et al. 2007). There is considerable evidence to demonstrate that ants display ownership\n450 behaviour, whereby they behave more aggressively towards predators in the vicinity of\n451 tended colonies than elsewhere (Way 1963). In the case of coccinellids, this aggression\n452 may be directed toward both adults and larvae, the former being chased away (e.g., Itioka\n453 and Inoue 1996; Sloggett 1998), while the latter may be picked up and dropped off the\n454 plant, or killed (e.g., Jiggins et al. 1993; Sloggett and Majerus 2003). As a result of ant\n455 aggression, most coccinellids only feed on ant-tended prey when untended prey are scarce\n456 (Sloggett and Majerus 2000). Many coccinellids have defences against ant aggression,\n457 which may be behavioural, chemical or physical and lead to variation in tolerance to ants\n458 amongst different coccinellid species (Majerus et al. 2007). For example, Sloggett and\n459 Majerus (2000) showed a hierarchy in six species of coccinellid living in pine woodland in\n460 the UK to aggression from Formica rufa (L.) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) from no toler-\n461 ance (M. 18-guttata and A. ocellata) to high tolerance (C. magnifica). Unfortunately, the\n462 level of tolerance of H. axyridis to ant aggression in either its native or its invasive range is\n463 unknown. Should H. axyridis be found to be intolerant of ant presence, it is likely that\n464 those aphidophages that have a significant degree of ant tolerance, such as M. oblongo-\n465 guttata and C. 7-punctata, will find a refuge from some of the effects of intraguild\n466 predation and competition imposed by H. axyridis in habitats occupied by ant-tended\n467 aphids. Experiments to investigate the level of tolerance of H. axyridis to common aphid\n468 tending ants, such as F. rufa, Lasius niger (L.) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and Myrmica\n469 ruginodis Nylander (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), are urgently needed. The small number of\n470 coccinellid species that are true myrmecophiles, i.e., have the closest relationships with\n471 ants and associated high tolerance, are likely to have the safest refuge from H. axyridis,\n472 unless H. axyridis is also highly tolerant to ants. These species include C. magnifica\n473 (Sloggett et al. 2002; Majerus et al. 2007) and Platynaspis luteorubra (Goeze) (Vo\u00a8lkl\n474 1995; Godeau 2000). It is possible that some species that have some tolerance of\n475 ants may come under additional selection pressures to improve their tolerance as a result of\n476 the presence of H. axyridis. In regions now occupied by H. axyridis, monitoring the\n477 coccinellid presence in the vicinity of nests of F. rufa over the next decade would be\n478 valuable.\n479 Behavioural interactions\n480 Further work is also required to acquire data on behavioural defence strategies of guild\n481 members in the presence of H. axyridis, such as dislodgement (dropping behaviour) and\n482 escape behaviourswhich could be extremely important for some species. For example, larvae\n483 of the coccinellid P. 14-punctata are consumed by H. axyridis in laboratory studies con-\n484 ducted in Petri dishes, but it is speculated that the highly mobile larvae of this species may\n485 have the capability to successfully escape from H. axyridis in field situations (Ware and\n486 Majerus 2008). We also know that parasitoids and predators can use volatile and chemical\nIntraguild predation involving H. axyridis\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 10-10-2007 Pages : 22\nArticle No. : 9125 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO632 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n487 cues to avoid competition; both the coccinellid C. 7-punctata and the predatory bug\n488 Anthocoris nemorum (L.) (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) can detect and avoid surfaces con-\n489 taminated by the fungal pathogenB. bassiana towhich they are susceptible (Meyling andPell\n490 2006;Ormond 2007). In addition, the aphid parasitoidA. ervi detects volatiles from the tracks\n491 ofC. 7-punctata and avoids oviposition in nearby aphid populations (Nakashima et al. 2004).\n492 Such behavioural responses can ensure co-existence by reducing the risk of intraguild pre-\n493 dation. They may contribute to co-existence of H. axyridis in its co-evolved native guild\n494 populations and are currently being evaluated for H. axyridis in the broader UK guild.\n495 Other intraguild interactions, such as facilitation, have been recorded for some species\n496 and shown to mitigate the effects of intraguild predation on guild diversity and may also\n497 apply to H. axyridis. For example, although C. 7-punctata is an intraguild predator of the\n498 aphid-specific pathogenic fungus P. neoaphidis, it does not consume whole, fungal\n499 cadavers and transmission of the fungus is not reduced. Indeed, C. 7-punctata enhances\n500 transmission of the fungus and passively vectors it between aphid populations, thereby also\n501 aiding pathogen dispersal (Roy et al. 1998, 2001; Roy and Pell 2000). Some of these\n502 co-evolved behavioural traits may contribute to the maintenance of guild diversity in the\n503 native range of H. axyridis and may mitigate its effects on some species in the invasive\n504 range. In preliminary studies, H. axyridis did enhance transmission and dispersal of\n505 P. neoaphidis in the laboratory (J. Baverstock personal observation).\n506 Natural enemy release and biotype variation\n507 Differences in functional traits of invasive and non-invasive biotypes of H. axyridis may\n508 have exacerbated their impact in non-native ecosystems. Although direct comparisons\n509 between different biotypes of H. axyridis and other natural enemies found in its exotic\n510 range have only been made for a limited number of functional traits, they have all dem-\n511 onstrated that the UK invasive biotype is a stronger asymmetric intraguild predator than the\n512 Japanese biotype. Specifically Roy et al. (2008b) demonstrated that H. axyridis from a\n513 culture derived from Japan were less likely to consume aphid cadavers supporting the\n514 beneficial aphid-specific fungal pathogen P. neoaphidis than those derived from the UK.\n515 They speculated that H. axyridis obtained from non-native populations were derived from\n516 biological control cultures and, through microevolution or founder effects, have been,\n517 perhaps unintentionally, selected for extreme polyphagy and an increased tendency\n518 towards intraguild predation compared to H. axyridis in its native range (Roderick and\n519 Howarth 1999; Hufbauer and oderick 2005; Roy et al. 2008a). It would be extremely\n520 interesting to compare the strength and symmetry of intraguild interactions between\n521 Japanese, UK and US derived H. axyridis for a wider range of guild members, from both\n522 native and non-native ranges to determine if they function differently in relation to all guild\n523 members with which they compete. In addition, UK-derived H. axyridis have greater\n524 resistance to some natural enemies, such as the fungus B. bassiana and the parasitoid wasp,\n525 Dinocampus coccinellae Schrank (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) than do Japanese-derived\n526 H. axyridis, implying that they have also been released from their own population regu-\n527 lators (Koyama and Majerus 2008; Roy et al. 2008b). Evolution of resistance to disease,\n528 parasitism and insecticides is not uncommon in insects and may be associated with trade\n529 offs in fitness (e.g., Foster et al. 2007; Vo\u00a8lkl et al. 2007). For example, although\n530 UK-derived H. axyridis were less suceptible to infection they were also significantly less\n531 fecund when infected than B. bassiana-infected H. axyridis derived from Japan (Roy et al.\nJ. K. Pell et al.\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 10-10-2007 Pages : 22\nArticle No. : 9125 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO632 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n532 2008b). Further research is needed to fully evaluate these interactions and determine\n533 whether any associated fitness costs could prove to be H. axyridis\u2019 weakness.\n534 Going beyond managed ecosystems\n535 The focus of research has largely been on interactions between H. axyridis and other\n536 coccinellids in managed ecosystems and, until recently, mainly in the USA, which has very\n537 different agricultural systems to Europe. However, it is clear from the studies described\n538 above that H. axyridis can have impacts on many other species and that this has impli-\n539 cations beyond managed ecosystems to natural habitats. Such impacts require urgent\n540 investigation. Harmonia axyridis is dispersive and highly polyphagous and therefore likely\n541 to impinge on many foodwebs in many different ecosystems, with the potential to disrupt\n542 them all. Although native coccinellids with similar prey and habitat requirements are at\n543 greatest risk, other non-coccinellid guild members and non-target species beyond the guild,\n544 such as Hemiptera of no economic importance (Majerus et al. 2006), lepidopteran eggs and\n545 larvae (Koch 2003; Koch et al. 2006) and all the predators, hyperparasites and pathogens\n546 in the higher trophic levels (Roy et al. 2008b) that may also be negatively affected. This\n547 represents a significant threat to biodiversity per se, particularly as some of these species\n548 are of considerable conservation concern (Koch et al. 2006).\n549 What about scale?\n550 We must also remember that many of the studies to date have been made on a small scale\n551 in the laboratory. This does not detract from their value in identifying key protagonists and\n552 \u2018worst case scenarios\u2019: certainly, a species that is not preyed on by H. axyridis in a Petri\n553 dish experiment is unlikely to be at risk in the field. However, they do not consider the\n554 importance of spatial scale and habitat complexity on niche differentiation and the out-\n555 come of contests. Testing hypotheses on these subjects requires experiments to move to\n556 larger spatial and temporal scales. The work of Snyder et al. (2004a) demonstrated that,\n557 although parasitoid \u2018mummies\u2019 of A. asychis were susceptible to intraguild predation by\n558 H. axyridis, overall parasitism rates were unaffected when experiments were done on a\n559 larger spatial scale. It is also important to consider more complex communities, i.e. not just\n560 pairs of protagonist species but a more representative guild, if we are to determine whether\n561 diversity will decline and what implications this will have for ecosystem services.\n562 Potential implications for ecosystem services\n563 Predators are part of the functional biodiversity in managed ecosystems and, while not the\n564 only contributor to herbivore population regulation, they are essential for sustainable pest\n565 management through the ecosystem services they provide and that we depend upon. While\n566 the abundance of particular species can be enhanced through biological control, the\n567 question of \u2018how many species are required to achieve the required service in the crop?\u2019\n568 continues to be a matter of debate (e.g., Denoth et al. 2002; Pell 2008; Straub et al. 2008)\n569 and must be considered in the context of the arrival of H. axyridis and potential declines in\n570 guild diversity. The relationship between predator biodiversity and ecosystem function is\n571 poorly understood. From the studies described above, and field observations of declines in\nIntraguild predation involving H. axyridis\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 10-10-2007 Pages : 22\nArticle No. : 9125 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO632 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n572 native aphidophages and coccidophages since the arrival of H. axyridis, we must consider\n573 whether H. axyridis as a top predator, will deliver the same ecosystem service when other\n574 guild species are excluded or whether this will reduce aphid regulation (prey release) and\n575 the reliability of biological control in the long term.\n576 Straub et al. (2008) reviewed recent literature on the relative pest suppression function\n577 of multiple (more than two) compared to single predator species and found that the rela-\n578 tionship between predator diversity and pest suppression was context dependent and could\n579 be positive, negative or neutral. Theoretically, if increasing predator diversity encourages\n580 intraguild predation, or, as in the case of invasion by H. axyridis, an invasive intraguild\n581 predator is introduced to the system, then the prediction would be that the equilibrium\n582 density of the herbivore would increase and pest control function would be reduced (e.g.,\n583 Polis et al. 1989; Finke and Denno 2004). Effectively, trophic cascades would be damp-\n584 ened and the herbivore would be released from predation. However, the experimental\n585 evidence to support this in a number of communities is mixed. Some studies have docu-\n586 mented disruption of pest suppression and others have shown either no change or improved\n587 pest suppression in the presence of intraguild predation (Straub et al. 2008). Most recent\n588 meta-analysis by Rosenheim and Harmon (2006) and a literature review by Janssen et al.\n589 (2006) find no evidence that the presence of intraguild predation disrupts herbivore control.\n590 However, there was greater variation than expected between cases, suggesting that pest\n591 release depended on system-specific factors, such as the biological traits of the predators\n592 and prey, and extrinsic factors, such as the environment: i.e., there was no simple\n593 prediction relating intraguild predation to pest release (Straub et al. 2008).\n594 However, Straub et al. (2008) have identified particular traits of relevance from the\n595 theoretical literature. The first relates to the life history of the intraguild prey. Coincidental\n596 intraguild predation of parasitoids and pathogens is likely to be less disruptive to herbivore\n597 suppression than omnivorous intraguild predation of other predators because predation of\n598 the herbivore and the parasitoid\/pathogen are directly linked and intraguild predation will\n599 simultaneously result in predation of the herbivore (Rosenheim et al. 1995). However, this\n600 may not hold if several generations of the intraguild prey are considered (Snyder and Ives\n601 2001). Secondly, the relative mobility and size (foraging mode) of the intraguild predator,\n602 intraguild prey and the herbivore can all influence the likelihood of prey release. A \u2018sit and\n603 wait\u2019 intraguild predator could disrupt suppression of a sedentary herbivore by a mobile\n604 intraguild prey species, although this will depend on the size of the intraguild prey species\n605 too. If it is large and highly mobile, it will have a large demand for prey, and if removed\n606 from the system by intraguild predation could result in release of the herbivore prey\n607 (Rosenheim and Corbett 2003). Furthermore, if the intraguild prey is a similar size to the\n608 herbivore then adding a larger intraguild predator will enhance herbivore suppression\n609 because predation of the herbivore by the intraguild predator would greatly outweigh the\n610 small release from predation achieved by the consumption of the intraguild prey (Diehl\n611 1993). The opposite would be the case if the intraguild prey was much larger than the\n612 herbivore (Rosenheim and Corbett 2003). There is some experimental support for this\n613 second prediction (Rosenheim et al. 2004a, b) but for the most part they remain hypotheses\n614 that require experimental evaluation. In addition, they will be influenced by whether the\n615 top intraguild predator is co-evolved with the rest of the guild or whether it is an exotic\n616 alien species, as is the case with H. axyridis. Using the hypotheses above, one could\n617 predict from the biological traits of H. axyridis that it would release herbivores from\n618 control because it consumes intraguild prey that are large and mobile. However, it is itself\n619 large, mobile, well defended, multivoltine and highly voracious which could compensate\n620 for this, at least in the short term.\nJ. K. Pell et al.\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 10-10-2007 Pages : 22\nArticle No. : 9125 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO632 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n621 Within guilds of predators some species may be functionally redundant if they share\n622 traits and their function would be replaced by other species should they be lost (Wilby and\n623 Thomas 2002a, b; Ives et al. 2005; Casula et al. 2006). If there are many redundant species\n624 within a guild, then a decline in their diversity associated with the arrival of H. axyridis\n625 may not influence overall function. However, determining whether species are functionally\n626 redundant within a guild relies on the ability to divide them into functional groups with\n627 similar traits (e.g., prey preference, response to prey density, microhabitat use and phe-\n628 nology). Those with similar traits should compete strongly for resources and are, therefore,\n629 likely to be functionally redundant.\n630 Within the aphidophagous guild there have been studies to demonstrate that increasing\n631 the number of species in the guild increases prey suppression, suggesting resource-use\n632 complementarity (Powell et al. 2006). However, other workers have shown no such effects\n633 and suggest significant redundancy of some guild members (Evans 1991; Chang 1996;\n634 Straub and Snyder 2006). The former may be more likely because the latter results could\n635 be due to negative and positive interactions between species counteracting each other\n636 (Snyder and Ives 2003) or because species that appear functionally redundant under some\n637 environmental conditions are functionally diverse when environmental conditions change\n638 (Naeem and Li 1997). This effect is encompassed in the \u2018insurance hypothesis\u2019 that\n639 maintains that different predators perform better or worse in particular environments and\n640 that by maintaining them all provides functional compensation and reliable pest sup-\n641 pression despite changing conditions (Loreau et al. 2003). This is essential in managed\n642 ecosystems that are fragmented and under constant change (Pell 2008). The multiplicity of\n643 responses to change that species from a single functional group are capable of, is critical to\n644 landscape scale ecosystem resilience (Elmquist et al. 2003). There are good examples of\n645 this in the aphid\/ predator system (Pell 2008). Key aphid mortality factors, which can be\n646 parasitoids on some occasions and syrphids, ground predators or entomopathogenic fungi\n647 on other occasions, demonstrate the need for diversity as insurance for function (Krauss\n648 and Poehling 1996; Hemmati 1999; O\u00a8stman et al. 2001; Powell et al. 2003, 2004;\n649 Tscharntke et al. 2005; Pell 2008). Declines in guild diversity as a result of introduction of\n650 H. axyridis could, therefore, reduce the resilience of pest suppression in the long term.\n651 A single prey type, or even species, can provide multiple feeding niches that a diversity\n652 of predators can use if there is niche complementarity rather than redundancy and this is\n653 achieved by resource partitioning and facilitation amongst predators. If their is complete\n654 complementarity then predator diversity should increase pest suppression (Wilby and\n655 Thomas 2002a, b; Casula et al. 2006). There is significant evidence for resource parti-\n656 tioning and facilitation within the aphid\/predator system (Pell 2008). For example variation\n657 between aphid species, or within a species, provides an opportunity for preference amongst\n658 predators. The coccinellid C. 7-punctata exploited red morphs of the pea aphid more than\n659 green morphs whereas the parasitoid A. ervi only attacked green morphs, effectively\n660 partitioning the resource between them (Losey et al. 1997). Coccinellid species differ in\n661 their response to prey density, some being more effective at low densities and others at\n662 high densities, which effectively separates them into complementary niches (Evans 2004;\n663 Schellhorn and Andow 2005). A further example of complementarity can be seen for the\n664 interactions between C. 7-punctata, a foliar aphid predator, and the carabid beetle\n665 Harpalus pennsylvanicus (DeGeer) (Coleoptera: Carabidae), which is restricted to foraging\n666 on the soil surface. As the coccinellid forages, it dislodges aphids that are then consumed\n667 by the ground predator, enhancing overall aphid suppression (Losey and Denno 1998).\n668 Coccinellid predators and parasitoids also facilitate transmission and dispersal of the\n669 beneficial aphid pathogen P. neoaphidis (Pell et al. 1997; Fuentes-Contreras et al. 1998;\nIntraguild predation involving H. axyridis\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 10-10-2007 Pages : 22\nArticle No. : 9125 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO632 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n670 Roy et al. 1998, 2001; Baverstock et al. 2005). Avoidance behaviour of parasitoids and\n671 coccinellids in relation to other intraguild predators is common (Nakashima et al. 2004;\n672 Meyling and Pell 2006; Ormond 2007). As already described, coccinellid species can also\n673 be phenologically separated, thereby partitioning resources temporally and avoiding\n674 competition (Takahashi and Naito 1984; Sato 2001; Flowers et al. 2006) or they can have\n675 different patch-leaving times (Sato et al. 2003). As there are numerous examples of\n676 complementarity amongst aphidophagous species, it follows that the more species there are\n677 in the guild, the greater pest suppression will be. This confirms the hypothesis that declines\n678 in guild diversity as a result of introduction of H. axyridis could reduce effective pest\n679 suppression.\n680 Summary\n681 Overall, the evidence suggests that predator diversity is necessary for resilient pest sup-\n682 pression and that includes aphid and coccid control (Stiling and Cornelissen 2005;\n683 Cardinale et al. 2006; Pell 2008; Straub et al. 2008). Although intraguild predation does\n684 not necessarily interfere with the overall ecosystem service it can interfere with pest\n685 suppression in some systems, particularly when the intraguild prey are large compared to\n686 the extraguild prey and this is the case for H. axyridis. Niche complementarity is almost\n687 certainly the mechanism by which H. axyridis remains in equilibrium with its co-evolved\n688 native guild of predators. In its exotic range, the guild of predators are co-evolved with\n689 each other but not with H. axyridis and as such come into direct competition with\n690 H. axyridis. This has significant implications for predator diversity, biodiversity per se and\n691 also ecosystem services. Pest management strategies aimed at maintaining predator\n692 diversity through habitat manipulation and the diversification of our agricultural land-\n693 scapes could help counter declines in predator diversity associated with the arrival of\n694 H. axyridis (e.g., Barbosa 1998; Landis et al. 2000; Gurr et al. 2004; Pell 2008). Although\n695 implications for biodiversity in natural habitats are of grave concern, it is perhaps through\n696 the manipulation of managed land, which, for example, represents 70% of land in the UK,\n697 that we have the greatest chance of optimising the environment to favour our native\n698 diversity in the presence of H. axyridis, thereby also protecting diversity in natural\n699 habitats. To achieve this we need robust research data to fill the gaps in knowledge\n700 identified in this paper and develop mitigation strategies.\n701 Acknowledgements Judith K.
