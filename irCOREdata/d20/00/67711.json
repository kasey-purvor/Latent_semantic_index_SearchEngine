We capitalise on the very large field of view of\nthe Halley HF radar to provide a comprehensive\ndescription of the electric field response to the substorm\ngrowth phase and expansion phase onset of a relatively\nsimple isolated substorm ( |AL| < 250 nT) which oc-\ncurred on 13 June 1988. The substorm phases are\nidentified by their standard ground magnetic and\nspacecraft energetic particle signatures, which provide\na framework for the radar measurements. The substorm\nis preceded by a prolonged period (>12 h) of magnetic\nquiescence, such that prior to the start of the growth\nphase, the apparent latitudinal motion of the radar\nbackscatter returns is consistent with the variation in\nlatitude of the quiet-time auroral oval with magnetic\nlocal time. The growth phase is characterised by an\nincreasing, superimposed equatorward motion of the\nequatorward edge of the radar backscatter as the\nauroral oval expands. Within this backscatter region,\nthere is a poleward gradient in the Doppler spectral\nwidth, which we believe to correspond to latitudinal\nstructure in auroral emissions and magnetospheric\nprecipitation. During the growth phase the ionospheric\nconvection is dominated by a relatively smooth large-\nscale flow pattern consistent with the expanding DP2\n(convection) auroral electrojets. Immediately prior to\nsubstorm onset the ionospheric convection observed by\nthe radar in the midnight sector has a predominantly\nequatorward flow component. At substorm onset a\ndramatic change occurs and a poleward flow component\nprevails. The timing and location are quite remarkable.\nThe timing of the flow change is within one minute of\nthe dispersionless injection observed at geostationary\norbit and the Pi2 magnetic signature on the ground. The\nlocation shows that this sudden change in flow is due to\nthe effect of the upward field aligned current of the\nsubstorm current wedge imposed directly within the\nHalley radar field of view.\n1 Introduction\nMore than three decades ago, Akasofu (1964) presented\nhis seminal work on the spatial and temporal develop-\nment of the auroral substorm as observed by ground-\nbased all-sky cameras. In the intervening years, a great\ndeal of progress has been made. An important step has\nbeen a description of the substorm signatures seen by\nother remote sensing and in-situ instruments, e.g.\nground magnetometers and spacecraft (see e.g. McPher-\nron et al., 1973; Rostoker et al., 1980; Baker et al., 1993;\nand references therein).\nIn terms of all these signatures, the substorm incor-\nporates three phases: the growth phase, the expansion\nphase and the recovery phase. During the course of the\ngrowth phase, the auroral oval expands equatorward\nand there is an increase in the strength of the DP2\nauroral electrojets. The brightening of the most equa-\ntorward auroral arc signals the onset of the expansion\nphase, accompanied by a Pi2 pulsation and the injection\nof energetic particles into the inner magnetosphere. The\nsubstorm current wedge (SCW) is established in the\nmagnetosphere and the westward travelling surge (WTS)\nforms to carry the upward field aligned current at its\nwestern edge in the auroral ionosphere. The associated\naurora expands reaching its maximum poleward extent\nat the end of the expansion phase, whence the recovery\nphase begins. The recovery phase is not so well described\nor understood, and although activity may diminish in\nthe midnight sector, much activity occurs in the morning\nsector, where for example large-scale auroral omega\nbands develop and drift eastward.\nAny individual substorm can be more complex than\nthis simple sequence of growth, onset and recovery, and\nmay include pseudo-breakups, intensifications and mul-\ntiple onsets. Also, a series of parallel effects occur in the\nmagnetosphere during the course of a substorm, but\nthese will not be considered here.\nCorrespondence to: R. V. Lewis\nAnn. Geophysicae 15, 289\u2013299 (1997) \u00d3 EGS\u2013Springer-Verlag 1997\nBy comparison with the familiar signatures just\ndescribed, the electric field response (directly related to\nthe plasma velocity at F-region altitudes) has received\nless attention: the most thorough descriptions have been\nprovided by a series of papers comprising detailed data\nanalysis and modelling work using the STARE VHF\nradar (Baumjohann et al., 1981; Inhester et al., 1981;\nOpgenoorth et al., 1983). Recently, two separate studies\nhave used the Halley HF radar to investigate the\nionospheric convection associated with substorm activ-\nity: Morelli et al., (1995) discussed the plasma flows in\nthe auroral zone during a very complicated multiple on-\nset substorm, whereas Yeoman and Pinnock (1996) were\nmore concerned with the timing between the magneto-\ntail response and the ionospheric plasma motion.\nThis study contributes further to this area of research.\nIt concentrates on a relatively simple isolated substorm,\nwhich occurred on 13 June 1988, and provides a descrip-\ntion of the electric field response to the substorm growth\nphase and the expansion phase onset. Firstly, the growth\nphase is of particular interest because the substorm is\npreceded by a prolonged interval of magnetic quiet, so\nthat the magnetosphere must have been close to a rare\n\u2018\u2018ground state\u2019\u2019 prior to the activity. Secondly, at the\nexact time of substorm onset, the data show that the\nupward field-aligned current (FaC) of the SCW has a\ndramatic effect on the ionospheric plasma flow.\n2 Instrumentation\nFigure 1 is a map of the southern polar region, showing\nthe actual or projected locations of the instruments used\nin this study. The key instrument is the Halley HF radar,\nwhich is part of the Southern Hemisphere Auroral\nRadar Experiment (SHARE), itself a component of the\nSuper Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) (see\nGreenwald et al., 1985; Baker et al., 1989; Greenwald\net al., 1995). The radar operates in the high frequency\nband and is sensitive to coherent backscatter from deca-\nmeter-scale ionospheric irregularities, which at F-region\naltitudes drift with the ambient plasma (Ruohoniemi\net al., 1987). The measured parameters are the back-\nscattered power, the line-of-sight Doppler velocity and\nthe Doppler spectral width. The mode of operation of\nthe radar for the interval studied on this occasion is to\nscan through sixteen beam positions in a total of 96 s,\ngiving a dwell time of 6 s in each position. The beams\nsweep out an area of about 65 \u00b0 \u2013 85 \u00b0 PACE geomagnetic\nlatitude and 4 h of local time, with a typical spatial\nresolution along the beam of 45 km. The field of view\n(FoV) is shown in Fig. 1 by the grey shaded area.\nData from a number of other sources are utilised in\norder to provide a substorm framework in which to\ninterpret the radar data. On the ground, magnetometer\ndata are available from Halley (HAL) station in the\nSouthern Hemisphere, and from the Canadian Magnetic\nObservatory Network, the Greenland magnetometer\nchain (Friis-Christensen et al., 1988) and the UK Sub-\nAuroral Magnetometer Network (SAMNET) (Yeoman\net al., 1990) in the Northern Hemisphere. The conjugate\nmapping of several Northern Hemisphere sites is shown\nin Fig. 1: note particularly Narssarssuaq (NAQ\u2019) and\nSt. Johns (STJ\u2019). Also available is the auroral electrojet\n(AE) index (Davis and Sugiura, 1966), which yields a\nmeasure of global (Northern Hemisphere) auroral\nelectrojet activity. At geostationary orbit, energetic\nparticle data are available from the Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory (LANL) spacecraft (e.g. Baker\net al., 1979). The magnetic footprint of LANL geosta-\ntionary spacecraft 1987\u2013097 is shown in Fig. 1.\n3 Observations\n3.1 Overview\nFigure 2 presents an overview both of the geomagnetic\nactivity and the ionospheric convection associated with\na small, isolated substorm that occurred on 13 June\n1988. Data are plotted for the interval 00:00 UT to 05:00\nUT. Unfortunately no interplanetary magnetic field data\nare available for this interval.\nIn the top panel of Fig. 2, we show the auroral\nelectrojet upper (AU) and lower (AL) indices, as derived\nfrom 12 magnetometers in the Northern Hemisphere in\nthe usual manner (WDC-2 for Geomagnetism, Data\nBook Number 23, AE 1988a, September 1994). There is\nan initial rise in AU at about 00:25 UT, before a larger\nrise in AU between 01 UT and 02 UT. This corresponds\nFig. 1.

V. Lewis et al.: The electric field repsonse to the growth phase and expansion phase 291\nto an increase in the strength of the eastward electrojet\nand defines the substorm growth phase. Simultaneously\nwith the latter rise in AU there is a slight decrease in AL\ncorresponding to an increase in the strength of the west-\nward electrojet. It is also worth noting that there is over\ntwelve hours of magnetic quiescence prior to the growth\nphase, Kp values are low ranging from 0+ to 1+, and\nAE does not exceed 100 nT.\nThe onset of the substorm expansion phase occurs at\n02:11 \u008b 1 min UT, as indicated by the very sudden\ndecrease in AL from about )60 nT to about )240 nT\nwithin a few minutes. At this stage, the contributing\nstations to AL are first briefly Leirvogur (LRV) and\nthen Narssarssuaq (NAQ). This is an indication of the\nDP1 electrojet of the SCW being established in the\n00 to 03 MLT sector. Thereafter AL begins to recover\nand by 03:35 UT both AL and AU have returned to\ntheir pre-expansion phase levels. We take this to indicate\nthe end of substorm activity.\nCorroborating evidence for the timing of the sub-\nstorm onset is provided by a clear Pi2 signature (not\nshown), which is observed at 02:10 UT in the Southern\nHemisphere at HAL and by the SAMNET magneto-\nmeter array located in the Northern Hemisphere. We\ninfer from the H and D component bays that the\nwesternmost stations of the array (FAR, GML, YOR)\nlie close to the eastern edge of the SCW before 03 MLT.\nLikewise, the western edge of the SCW is inferred to be\nafter 22 MLT, the MLT sector of magnetometers at\nFaraday, Argentine Islands (AIA) in the Southern\nHemisphere and Ottawa (OTT) in the Northern Hemi-\nsphere.\nEnergetic electron and proton (not shown) data from\nLos Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) geostation-\nary spacecraft 1987\u2013097 at )38 \u00b0 E longitude also confirm\nthe timing of the isolated substorm by a well-defined\ndispersionless injection at 02:11 \u008b 1 min UT (see middle\npanel of Fig. 2). Thus, the spacecraft, situated just\nbefore midnight MLT, is inside the injection region.\nIn the bottom panel of Fig. 2, we show observations\nby the Halley HF radar. The data plotted are the line-of\nsight velocities along the magnetic meridian as a\nfunction of PACE geomagnetic latitude and time. The\nline-of-sight velocities are colour coded to indicate flow\ntowards (positive values) and away from (negative\nvalues) the radar. There are several important features\nto highlight in the data. During the growth phase, the\nbackscatter recorded by the radar moves equatorward.\nThe line-of-sight Doppler velocities are initially away\nfrom the radar, i.e. poleward, and then from 01:10 UT\nare generally towards the radar, i.e. equatorward.\nFinally, at 02:11 UT (substorm onset) the flow reverses\nfrom equatorward to poleward. At this time, Halley is at\napproximately 23:30 MLT, close to the inferred location\nof the western edge of the SCW. A few minutes after\nsubstorm onset, there is a general loss of backscatter\nacross all range gates.\nWe now explore the observations in greater detail,\nwhich divide neatly into the traditional substorm growth\nphase and expansion phase onset.\n3.2 Growth phase\n3.2.1 Relationship of the radar backscatter to the auroral\noval boundaries. Figure 3 shows the Doppler spectral\nwidth of the Halley HF radar backscatter as a function\nof PACE geomagnetic latitude and time from 00:00 UT\nto 03:00 UT on 13 June 1988. This parameter is a\nmeasure of the flow variability within the backscattering\nvolume. There are two key features. Firstly, there is a\npoleward gradient in the Doppler spectral width \u2013 a\nregion of mainly low spectral width (K100 ms)1 \u2013 blue\ncolour) lies equatorward of a region of mainly high\nspectral width (J200 ms)1 \u2013 green colour). We shall\nreturn to the Doppler spectral width in the discussion\nsection. Secondly, note again the equatorward expan-\nsion of the backscattered signal.\nIn order to put these HF radar observations into\ncontext we overlay the position of a mathematical\nrepresentation of the Feldstein oval for three levels of\ngeomagnetic activity, Q \u0088 0, 1 and 2 (Feldstein, 1963;\nHolzworth and Meng, 1975, and references therein). The\npoleward edge and equatorward edge are plotted for the\nthree Q values as a function of PACE geomagnetic\nlatitude and the MLT of Halley (which varies from 20:27\nMLT to 00:27 MLT for this interval). All three statistical\novals show the latitudinal variation that one would ex-\npect for these MLT values, i.e. an equatorward motion in\nthe pre-midnight sector. Note that as the level of activity\nincreases (higher Q value), the width of the oval increases\nbecause of the greater expansion of the equatorward\nedge to lower latitudes relative to the poleward edge.\nBy comparing the location and variation in latitude\nof the radar backscatter returns with the Feldstein ovals,\nwe show that the rate of equatorward motion of the\nradar backscatter during the substorm growth phase\nexceeds that due to the diurnal variation in latitude of\nthe auroral oval for a fixed level of activity. Initially,\nbetween 00:00 UT on 13 June 1988 and 01:00 UT on 13\nJune 1988, the majority of the backscatter is within or\neven poleward of the Q \u0088 0 oval. As the growth phase\nprogresses, the location of the backscatter becomes\nmore consistent with the Q \u0088 1 oval (sec. 01:40 UT) and\nthen later with the Q \u0088 2 oval (sec. 02:00 UT). We\nattribute both the increasing width of and the equator-\nward motion of the radar backscatter during the\nsubstorm growth phase to the effect of an expanding\nauroral oval superimposed on the diurnal variation.\nWe provide some further confirmation for the rela-\ntionship between the HF radar backscatter and the\nauroral precipitation by utilising data from two Sun-\nsynchronous satellites, DMSP F8 and DMSP F9. Two\ndifferent analysis methods are employed.\nIn the first method, we map across MLT using the\nbest available Feldstein oval:\n1. For the interval 00:00 UT to 03:00 UT on 13 June\n1988, we note the MLT and the geomagnetic latitude for\nthose occasions when the satellite crossed a boundary\nplasma sheet (bp)\/central plasma sheet (cp) boundary as\nindicated by the DMSP neural net (Newell et al., 1991).\n(Between 00:33 UT and 00:44 UT, there are DMSP\ncrossings of the bp\/cp boundary at 18.5, 19.3 and 6.0\n292 R. V. Lewis et al.: The electric field repsonse to the growth phase and expansion phase\nMLT. Between 01:24 UT and 01:36 UT, there are\ncrossings at 5.1, 7.0 and 23.8 MLT and between 02:13\nUT and 02:26 UT, there are crossings at 18.9, 20.8 and\n5.4 MLT.) The bp\/cp boundary is likely to correspond\nto the equatorward edge of the Feldstein oval, i.e. the\nequatorward edge of the discrete aurora.\n2. At the MLT of the boundary crossing, we compare the\ngeomagnetic latitude of the satellite with the geomag-\nnetic latitude of the equatorward edge of the \u2018\u2018nearest\nQ\u2019\u2019 Feldstein oval and calculate the offset between the\nDMSP latitude and the Feldstein oval latitude.\n3. Knowing the MLT of Halley at the UT of the DMSP\nobservations (at 00:39 UT, the MLT of Halley is 22.1; at\n01:30 UT, the MLT of Halley is 22.9 and at 02:20 UT,\nthe MLT of Halley is 23.8), we find the latitude of the\nequatorward edge of the Feldstein oval at the MLT of\nHalley for the same Q value as in (2). Then we add the\noffset calculated in (2) to this latitude. In Fig. 3, the\ndiamonds (squares) represent results of this method for\nthe Southern (Northern) Hemisphere.\nIn the second method, we utilise the fact that between\nthem the DMSP satellites happen to make three\ncrossings of the bp\/cp boundary within several minutes\nof each other on each polar pass:\n1. We calculate the unique circle that fits these three\npoints. That is, we associate the bp\/cp boundary with\nthe equatorward edge of the Feldstein auroral oval,\nwhich can be approximated by a circle whose centre is in\ngeneral offset from the geomagnetic pole (Holzworth\nand Meng, 1975).\n2. We calculate the latitude of this circle at the MLT of\nHalley. This latitude is plotted (at the mid-time of the\nthree boundary crossings) as a plus (multiply) symbol\nfor each Southern (Northern) Hemisphere pass.\nFor both analysis methods, the satellite data show\nthat the equatorward edge of the discrete aurora\nexpands equatorward during the growth phase in the\nsame manner as the radar backscatter. Also, the DMSP\ncrossings closest in MLT to Halley, when projected\nalong the nearest Feldstein oval, lie systematically on the\nequatorward edge of the radar backscatter. (The cross-\nings further away in MLT lie further poleward.) Thus,\nthis edge seems most likely to be associated with the\nbp\/cp boundary.\n3.2.2 Ionospheric convection response. As described in the\nprevious overview section and shown in the bottom panel\nof Fig. 2, there are two flow regimes during the growth\nphase. Firstly, between 00:25 UT and 01:10 UT there is a\nweak poleward component to the flow (green region of\nbackscatter, )50 m s)1 to )300 m s)1), and from the\nvariation of the line-of-sight component across the FoV\n(not shown) we infer that there is also a larger westward\ncomponent to the flow. The flow direction is consistent\nwith flow aligned with a Feldstein auroral oval, which at\nthis MLT is tilted slightly with respect to a geomagnetic\nlatitude circle (see Fig. 3). Secondly, between 01:25 UT\nand 02:10 UT there is an equatorward component to the\nflow (blue region of backscatter, 50 m s)1 to ~ 400 m s)1),\nand the flow is inferred to have still a westward\ncomponent. (Between 01:10 UT and 01:25 UT, there is\na transitional period.) Thus, after 01:25 UT an equator-\nward flow component of at least 200 m s)1 has been\nsuperimposed on the previously existing auroral oval-\naligned flow. We attribute this equatorward flow com-\nponent mainly to the equatorward expansion of the\nauroral oval of order 200 m s)1 that occurs in this\ninterval.\n3.3 Expansion phase onset\n3.3.1 Location of the substorm current wedge. We now\nconsider in greater detail the ground-based observations\nof ionospheric currents used to determine the location of\nthe SCW. Figure 4 shows a composite plot of magne-\ntometer data from three stations: Narssarssuaq (NAQ),\nHalley (HAL) and St. Johns (STJ). The data are dis-\nplayed in local magnetic co-ordinates at 1 min resolu-\ntion.\nSubstorm onset occurs at NAQ at approximately\n02:12 \u008b 1 min UT on 13 June 1988. The dominant\nresponse to the SCW occurs in the H component, which\nrecorded a decrease of approximately 250 nT between\nonset and the maximum epoch of the expansion phase\ncompared with a decrease of around 100 nT in the D\ncomponent. The Z component decreased slightly at\nsubstorm onset and subsequently fluctuated about its\npre-substorm level, but by never more than about\n\u008b 50 nT. Therefore, these variations (and those at\nstations in the Greenland magnetometer chain further\npoleward, not shown) indicate that after substorm\nonset, NAQ is situated beneath a westward and slight-\nly poleward directed horizontal current. In other words,\nNAQ observed the intense DP1 electrojet of the SCW,\nwhich arises from the so-called Cowling effect (e.g.\nBaumjohann, 1983).\nIn the conjugate hemisphere, HAL maps to the\nmagnetic west of NAQ (see Fig. 1). The effect of a north-\neast equivalent current is observed at 02:11 \u008b 1 min UT,\nas indicated by an increase of about 20 nT in the H\ncomponent with a simultaneous decrease of about 50 nT\nin the D component. We interpret the equivalent current\nas being part of the vortical horizontal ionospheric\ncurrent outside the upward FaC of the SCW (e.g.,\nOpgenoorth et al., 1983). Thus, initially at substorm\nonset HAL is located slightly westward and equator-\nward of the upward FaC of the SCW. (Note that the\nsame conclusion would be reached if we interpreted the\nmagnetic perturbation at HAL as a sub-auroral signa-\nture of the SCW, Clauer and McPherron, 1974.)\nSupporting evidence for the location of the upward\nFaC of the SCW comes from mid-latitude magnetome-\nters. St. Johns (STJ) in the Northern Hemisphere is close\nto the magnetic longitude of HAL (see Fig. 1). We inter-\npret the STJ magnetic perturbations (Fig. 4) in the H\nand D components at substorm onset as those from a\nsub-auroral station (Clauer and McPherron, 1974). By\nthis argument, the upward FaC is close to the STJ\nmagnetic longitude, i.e. about 23:38 MLT. In any case,\nR. V. Lewis et al.: The electric field repsonse to the growth phase and expansion phase 293\nas mentioned in the overview sub-section, the upward\nFaC is definitely after 22 MLT.\nThe information gained from the magnetometers\ntogether with the observations at geostationary orbit are\nsummarised in Table 1. From this, it is concluded that\nsubstorm onset occurs at 02:11 \u008b 1 min UT with the\neastern edge of the SCW located between 02:10 MLT\nand 02:50 MLT and the western edge of the SCW\nlocated at ~ 23:40 MLT just to the east of the Halley\nmagnetic meridian. The Halley HF radar is therefore in\nan ideal location to observe the effect of the upward FaC\non the ionospheric convection.\n3.3.2 Ionospheric convection response.

V. Lewis et al.: The electric field repsonse to the growth phase and expansion phase\nsubstorm onset, data from the Halley HF radar are\nshown in Fig. 5. The panel of radar data is divided into\nfour (not all consecutive) radar scans. Each scan\ndisplays line-of-sight velocities, colour coded to indicate\nflow towards (positive velocities) and away from (neg-\native velocities) the radar.\nThe line-of-sight velocities in the first scan, starting at\n02:04:36 UT (approx. 6\u20137 min before substorm onset),\nare negative in the western beams at higher latitudes,\nthat is flow with a component away from the radar, and\nthen traverse the colour scale so that they are positive in\nthe western beams at lower latitudes and also positive in\nFig. 5.

Lewis et al.: The electric field repsonse to the growth phase and expansion phase 295\nthe eastern beams, that is flow with a component\ntowards the radar. At the bottom of the figure is a\ncartoon which is consistent with the radar observations.\nIt suggests that the radar observes the return flow at the\nedge of the dusk convection cell associated with the DP2\nauroral electrojets.\nThe second scan, starting at 02:09:24 UT (the last\nscan prior to substorm onset), illustrates that flow with\nan equatorward component dominates across the FoV.\nThe cartoon that fits the 02:04:36 UT observations is\nconsistent also with the second scan if the generally\nwestward flow in this cartoon is rotated by about 15\u00b0\nequatorward.\nThe next available scan starting at 02:11:06 UT\ndemonstrates that immediately after substorm onset,\nthere has been a dramatic change to the flow pattern: the\npredominantly equatorward component that exists im-\nmediately prior to onset has been replaced by a\npredominantly poleward flow component. The timing\nis quite remarkable: the sudden change in flow is at\nexactly the same time as substorm onset when the SCW\nis established in the auroral ionosphere. The accompa-\nnying cartoon illustrates the effect that this current\nsystem has on the flow in the radar FoV. The upward\nFaC of the SCW is on the eastern side of the FoV and\ndrives an ionospheric flow around it. Such a flow is not\ninconsistent with the observed line-of-sight velocities\nand a current system similar to this may well exist after\nsubstorm onset. However, it should be emphasised that\nthe situation could well be more complicated than this\nidealised cartoon.\nThe final scan starting at 02:14:12 UT displays the\nflow pattern that is observed a few minutes after\nsubstorm onset. The region of predominantly poleward\nflow appears to have moved to the west, suggesting\npossible expansion of the SCW. Eastward of this region\nof poleward flow, there is an absence of backscatter. The\nloss of backscatter may be attributed to either the\nabsorption or screening by sporadic E of the HF radar\nsignal caused by energetic electron precipitation in the\nequatorward part of the radar FoV. Screening may be\nmore likely as data from the Halley Advanced Iono-\nspheric Sounder show auroral sporadic E precipitation\npoleward of Halley in association with the upward FaC\ncarried out of the western end of the SCW.\n4 Discussion\nThe ground magnetometer and geostationary spacecraft\ndata show very clearly the development of the substorm\nthrough the traditional growth, expansion and recovery\nphases. In this study, the key issues concern new\nobservations by the Halley HF radar of the electric field\nresponse to the growth phase and the expansion phase\nonset. The growth phase is preceded by a prolonged\ninterval of magnetic quiescence, such that prior to\nsubstorm activity, the magnetosphere is likely to be close\nto a ground state configuration. During the growth\nphase, an equatorward motion of the equatorward edge\nof the radar backscatter is observed. At substorm onset,\nthe radar is ideally located to observe the sudden\nreversal in the ionospheric convection from equator-\nward to poleward directed flow, as the western edge of\nthe SCW is imposed upon the auroral ionosphere.\nFirstly, we discuss the equatorward expansion of the\nHF radar backscatter during the substorm growth\nphase. A clue to the most plausible explanation for this\ncomes from the substorm study of Samson (1994). He\nreports an equatorward motion of 630.0 nm, 557.7 nm\nand 486.1 nm emissions in the midnight sector during\nthe substorm growth phase (see his Fig. 3 or alterna-\ntively Fig. 1 of Samson et al., 1992), which is very\nsimilar to the equatorward expansion of the HF radar\nbackscatter described in this work. Not only does it look\nthe same but we believe it has the same underlying\nphysical cause. Previously, we linked the backscatter to\nthe Feldstein auroral oval and to the region around the\nbp\/cp boundary. It is known that precipitation from this\nregion causes the auroral emissions observed by Samson\n(1994). Thus, the auroral emissions and the HF radar\nbackscatter can be expected to be coincident. Samson\n(1994) suggests that the equatorward motion \u2018\u2018probably\nresults from the increase in the cross-tail current near\nthe Earth and the stretching of field lines.\u2019\u2019 Consequent-\nly we propose the same explanation of the equatorward\nexpansion of the HF radar backscatter.\nSecondly, we comment on the structure within the\nHF radar backscatter. We noted before that there is a\npoleward gradient in the Doppler spectral width of the\nbackscatter (see Fig. 3). Given the relationship between\nthe backscatter and the auroral emissions, the gradient\nin the Doppler spectral width presumably corresponds\nto a similar gradient in the spectrum and variability of\nthe precipitation, and hence the conductivity and electric\nfields of the discrete aurora. The physical significance of\nthis spectral width gradient for the coupling between the\nionosphere and the magnetosphere is the subject of\nfurther work. It is a common feature within the HF\nradar dataset.\nThirdly, we summarise the evolution of the iono-\nspheric flow during the growth phase. To begin with, the\nradar backscatter lay along the quiet-time Feldstein oval\nand the flow was inferred to be aligned with it.\nSubsequently, the radar backscatter began to expand\nequatorward and a corresponding equatorward compo-\nnent was added to the flow.\nThis growth phase signature is not unique within the\nHalley HF radar dataset. We note that low Kp values\nprevailed prior to the substorm. We believe that this\nsignature corresponds to a particular class of growth\nphase that requires an extended quiet-time configuration\nof the magnetosphere prior to substorm activity. Under\nthese conditions, the ring current density is at a\nminimum level (we note Dst is positive throughout the\ninterval studied) and thus least effective at screening the\nmagnetospheric cross-tail electric field from lower lati-\ntudes (Southwood, 1977). We shall leave this interesting\npoint open to further investigation.\nFinally, we discuss the implications of our observa-\ntions at the time of substorm onset. STARE VHF radar\n296 R. V. Lewis et al.: The electric field repsonse to the growth phase and expansion phase\nobservations analysed by Inhester et al. (1981) and\nOpgenoorth et al. (1983) showed that the electric field\ncentred about the head of the WTS had an inwardly\ndirected radial component. In the study by Opgenoorth\net al. (1983), simultaneous measurements from a rocket\nflight revealed the electric field was weak inside the\nsurge.\nThe STARE data were complemented with data from\nthe Scandinavian Magnetometer Array. The ground\nmagnetometers provided concurrent spatial information\non the ionospheric equivalent currents. Using the\nelectric field data, detailed models of the WTS and the\nSCW were developed by varying the assumed conduc-\ntivity distribution until the model currents agreed\nroughly with the observed equivalent currents. It was\nfound that within the WTS, an intense westward\nCowling current fed a net upward FaC at its western\nedge. Within the surge itself, there was high conductivity\nwhich resulted in a weak electric field that was lower\nthan the threshold required for VHF backscatter.\nFurther to this, we note that outside the highly\nconducting Cowling channel, the radial component to\nthe electric field drove a Pedersen current toward the\ncentre of the surge head, which also feeds the upward\nFaC. Therefore, a vertical Hall current flows perpen-\ndicular to the Pedersen current. This vortical current can\nbe seen in the equivalent current pattern.\nIt is easy to envisage the observations presented here\nwithin this framework. This is sketched in the right-hand\ncartoon of Fig. 5. At substorm onset, the radar observed\na sudden change from equatorward to poleward direct-\ned flow as an immediate consequence of the establish-\nment of the SCW in the auroral ionosphere. This is\nconsistent with the previous STARE work. The plasma\nflow at F-region altitudes is driven perpendicular to the\nelectric field, which points radially to the centre of the\nsurge. Thus, outside the WTS the flow is in a clockwise\ndirection and, to the west of the upward FaC, the flow\nshould have a poleward component, as is observed by\nthe Halley HF radar in the present example. This in turn\nis confirmation for the location of the SCW as deduced\nfrom the ground magnetometer data.\nWe now compare our results with the HF radar\nobservations of Morelli et al. (1995) and Yeoman and\nPinnock (1996). These authors claimed to observe char-\nacteristics of a WTS with the Halley HF radar, and\nwhilst there are similarities in the results, there are\nseveral important differences.\nMorelli et al. (1995) described a region of low flow as\nthe signature of the WTS. Ahead of the WTS (i.e. to the\nwest) they observed enhanced equatorward flows, in\ncontrast to the enhanced poleward flows observed in the\npresent example and in the STARE work. Morelli et al.\n(1995) argue that the high conductivity region of the\nWTS creates an obstacle which diverts the background\nflow around it. In their example, the background flow\nhas a large equatorward component, which is therefore\nenhanced west of the WTS. In their model, the effect of\nthe upward FaC of the WTS is not included. As\ndiscussed already, this current draws a radial Pedersen\ncurrent driving a clockwise vortical flow around the\nupward FaC. To the west of the FaC this contributes a\npoleward flow component. Thus we conclude that in the\nstudy by Morelli et al. (1995) the vortical flow driven by\nthe upward FaC must have been weak compared to the\nbackground equatorward flow, such that the primary\neffect of the WTS on the flow was that due to the\nconductivity enhancement alone. In our study and\nothers (i.e. Inhester et al., 1981; Opgenoorth et al.,\n1983), the effect of the upward FaC is dominant,\nyielding the poleward flow component to the west of\nthe WTS. Certainly in our study the background current\nwould have been relatively weak because the ionosphere\npoleward of Halley was in 24 hour darkness on this day.\nFor the example studied by Yeoman and Pinnock\n(1996), which occurred much closer to dusk (19:20 MLT\nas opposed to 22:00 MLT), enhanced poleward flow is\nobserved to the west of the WTS (as in this study). In\ntheir example, this may be the vortical flow associated\nwith the upward FaC of the WTS. Alternatively, it could\nmeet the requirements of the Morelli et al. (1995)\nobstacle argument if there was a background eastward\nflow. This would mean that the WTS would have to\npropagate along the convection reversal boundary in the\nevening sector.\nHerein lies another difference between our observa-\ntions and these previous. The data presented here have\ndemonstrated that the flow reconfiguration occurred as\nan immediate consequence of the establishment of the\nupward FaC of the SCW in the Halley MLT sector, but\nboth Morelli et al. (1995) and Yeoman and Pinnock\n(1996) reported a WTS propagating into the FoV of the\nradar. This difference may be important also in under-\nstanding the behaviour of the flow (to the WTS).\n5 Conclusions\nThe electric field response to the growth phase and\nexpansion phase onset of a simple isolated substorm has\nbeen comprehensively described by the Halley HF\nradar. The availability of the AE index provided an\noverview of the substorm growth and expansion phases,\nwhereas more precise information on the timing of the\nexpansion phase onset and the location of the SCW was\ndeduced from the injection of energetic particles at\ngeostationary orbit and from magnetic bay and Pi2\npulsation activity on the ground.\nDuring the growth phase, the backscatter recorded\nby the Halley HF radar was observed to move to lower\nlatitudes as well as widen in latitudinal range. This\nsignature is not unique within the radar dataset and\nseems to occur following an extended period of magnetic\nquiet. It is very similar to the behaviour of auroral\nemissions reported by Samson (1994). The equatorward\nexpansion of the backscatter was described by a series of\nFeldstein auroral ovals of progressively higher geomag-\nnetic activity: it was not consistent with that expected\nfor the variation of the auroral oval with MLT for a\nfixed activity level.\nAlso during the growth phase, the flow adopted a\nmore equatorward component. This change was broadly\nR. V. Lewis et al.: The electric field repsonse to the growth phase and expansion phase 297\nconsistent with the rate of expansion of the equatorward\nbackscatter boundary.\nAn additional interesting aspect to the radar data was\na poleward gradient in the Doppler spectral width,\nwhich may map to a magnetospheric boundary. DMSP\ndata indicated that the backscatter region corresponded\nto the region of magnetospheric precipitation around\nthe bp\/cp boundary. Understanding the relationship\nbetween Doppler spectral width and night-side magne-\ntospheric precipitation is a priority for our future work.\nImmediately before substorm onset, the ionospheric\nconvection observed by the Halley HF radar was\ngoverned by the DP2 auroral electrojets. However,\nimmediately after onset a sudden change occurred as the\nflow direction reversed from an equatorward to a\npoleward component. The observations were shown to\nbe consistent with the effect of the upward FaC\ncontained with the WTS of the SCW having been\nimposed directly with the Halley FoV.\nWe have identified key features in the Halley HF\nradar observations during the substorm growth phase\nand expansion phase onset. Moreover at onset, the\nradar was ideally located to sense the establishment of\nthe upward FaC of the SCW in the auroral ionosphere.\nThe prospect of combining similar observations from\nthe SuperDARN network of HF radars with ISTP\nmission spacecraft should further enhance our under-\nstanding of the magnetospheric substorm process.\nAcknowledgements.
