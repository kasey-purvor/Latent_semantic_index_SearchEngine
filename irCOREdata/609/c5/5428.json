The integration of education techno-\nlogies with communication technologies introduced e-learning as an alternative or\ncomplementary approach for the traditional education methods that are subject to\ntime and location constraints. The necessity of having easier access to a wider range\nof information, coupled with the demand for effective and low cost education, paved\nthe way for the increased use of the Internet in learning environments. One of the\nchallenging problems that society has been facing is the need to improve the quality\nof e-learning systems.\nA number of studies have been conducted to gain a better understanding of the\nfactors that affect the success of e-learning systems and the interrelations of these\nfactors. The literature can be categorised into three main groups, namely, student and\ninstructor characteristics (Bozarth, Chapman, and LaMonica 2004; Greene et al. 2004;\nHillsheim 1998; Kerr, Rynearson, and Kerr 2006; Liaw, Huang, and Chen 2007;\n*Corresponding author. Email: kadir.geyik@postgrad.mbs.ac.uk\n22  H.I. Cebeci et al.\nMarom et al. 2003; Soong et al. 2001), instructional design factors (Bozarth,\nChapman, and LaMonica 2004; Wegner, Holloway, and Garton 1999), and demo-\ngraphic variables (Diaz 1999; Diaz 2000; Dille and Mezack 1991; Hillsheim 1998;\nLynn 2002; Marom et al. 2003; Muse 2003).\nOf these success factors, good instructional design is seen as a necessity for the\nestablishment of efficient learning environments. Instructional design factors can be\ndefined as the optimum design of the instructional environment to meet the require-\nments of both the students and the instructors (Qureshi 2004). Instructional design,\nfrom the Web-based learning perspective, is a three-dimensional process involving\ndesigners, students, and instructors (Wegner, Holloway, and Garton 1999). The\ndesigners provide the students with the appropriate course content through working\ncollaboratively with the instructors. Fresen and Boyd (2005) conducted a study\nregarding the critical success factors of Web-based learning systems and they synthe-\nsised a list of success categories and associated factors from several e-learning\nresources. For the category of instructional design, they identified 15 factors, which it\nis possible to divide into two groups: content design-related factors and other instruc-\ntional design factors (Table 1). The first group of factors is more about the interface\ndesign aspect of e-learning contents while the latter group is associated with the\nusability of content and student interaction.\nThe literature already offers a range of recommendations for the first group of\ninterface design factors, also known as content development standards, concerning\nissues such as the design of Web interface (Rollins 2002), texts (Ardac and Unal\n2008; Bullock, Geraci, and Bear 2003; Ipek 2001; Lee 1999; Qureshi 2004; Pomales-\nGarcia and Liu, 2006) multimedia applications such as graphics (Angeli and\nValanides, 2006; Jennings 2001; Qureshi 2004; Swan 2001), animations, video files,\nand colours (Angeli and Valanides 2006; Bhowmick et al. 2007; Bullock, Geraci, and\nBear 2003; Ipek 2001; Jones 2002; Paul 2001; Qureshi 2004), practical exercises and\nillustrative examples (Jennings 2001; Paul 2001). We already know that animations\nshould be designed to be interactive, complementary, and supportive to the text docu-\nments (Bullock, Geraci, and Bear 2003; Ipek 2001), but that the excessive usage of\ngraphics and animations may distract the attention of the students from the course\n(Ipek 2001). This study will assess the relative importance of such factors on student\nperformance.\nTable 1.

Since measuring this efficiency may not be\neasy to formulate, grade points are seen as indicators for students\u2019 success. The aim\nof this study is to establish a relationship between instructional design factors and the\nstudent success level. This relationship is investigated by making use of statistical and\nneural networks techniques. This section will describe issues regarding the variable\nselection, data collection and sampling, and data analysis.\nCreation of criteria\nHaving considered the instructional design factors particularly related to content\ndesign from the relevant literature, a list was created of 13 variables that are thought\nto be have an effect on student success. These variables were emailed to 20 inter-\nviewees a week ahead of a semi-structured individual interview. Interviewees were\nexperts who had been working on the project for more than five years. Eighty percent\nof the participants had an academic background in instructional design while the rest\nmostly had a design-oriented background. The email included an invitation for the\nsemi-structured interview together with information about what they were asked to\ncarry out before attending the interview. A text file including some explanation of the\nvariables and their brief description was also attached. The main aim of the email\ncommunication was to ask the interviewees to consider the suitability of those\nvariables as instructional design criteria.\nDuring the interview, the interviewees were also allowed to combine or eliminate\nsome of the variables to create a reduced set. All possible instructional design factors\nsuitable for the current project were extracted. The decision criterion for selecting\nthose factors was based on the major agreement of the participants for each criterion.\nOf these 13 variables, two were eliminated by all the participants and the rest were\nreduced to five factors.\nAt the end of the interview stage, the following criteria were selected as predictors\nof success: the length of the texts, the usage of examples and applications, exercises,\nquiz and homework, multimedia applications, and visual integrity. These criteria were\nutilised by the select models as independent variables, while the average grade of\nstudents in different courses was used as a proxy for student success. However, in\nthe  second implication of the artificial neural network (ANN) model, a different\noperationalisation was employed, which will be presented later.\nSample\nThe data used to perform the analyses were collected from the e-learning school of a\nuniversity in Turkey. The school consists of five different study programmes with\nmore than 100 courses, serving more than 1000 students in total. Only one study\nprogramme is business-related while the rest of them are technically oriented.\nA sample of five courses was selected from each programme for the data analy-\nses, giving a total of 25 courses. Each of the five courses is programme-specific and\nconsidered as representative for the corresponding programmes. The sampling\nprocess ensured that the courses chosen have different types of content covering a\nwide range of subjects and the sample includes courses with a variety of difficulty\n24  H.I. Cebeci et al.\nlevel for each specific programme. More than 100 students were enrolled in each\ncourse.\nData collection\nThe data collection had two parts. The first was conducted to obtain the instructional\ndesign scores. The courses were evaluated by the experts on each of the selected\ninstructional design factors. Second, students\u2019 grade point averages were collected\nfor  the corresponding courses directly from the student registration office of the\nuniversity.\nThe first part of the data was collected from the experts in the form of a survey.\nThe survey was used to obtain the scores on the five instructional design criteria, for\neach of the 25 courses. The experts were asked to evaluate each course based on the\nselected criteria by giving points on a scale between 0\u201310. The average grade was\nbased on overall 100 points. The results of these evaluations as an average of all\nopinions (for five random courses) can be seen in Table 2. In Table 2, the first column\nshows the codes which were developed for the purpose of differentiating the courses.\nThe length of the text was compared to already determined standards. The related\nliterature suggests that the optimal length of the texts should be 8\u201310 pages, given that\nanything between six and 12 pages is acceptable (Bullock, Geraci, and Bear 2003;\nIpek 2001). The length of the texts was categorised into three classes and for each of\nthem a ranking point was assigned. Conversion of the total average rankings into the\n10-point scale provided the final results for this variable.\nExamples and applications, and exercises and homework were rated by dividing\nthe number of weeks where these factors were demonstrated by the total number of\nweeks in the course. Regarding the usage of multimedia applications, this factor was\nassessed based on the usage of graphics and animation. Two usage categories were\nconsidered and the rankings corresponding to that categorisation converted to an\naverage usage of both animation and graphics, which was taken as a final point value.\nThe experts evaluated visual integrity intuitively as an average of the evaluations\ngiven to the quality of colour competence, the inclusion of multimedia applications\nand the texts in the whole content, and the errors occurred in the graphics and\nanimations used in the texts.\nThe final column represents the weighted average of the final marks of homework,\nquiz, and final examination for a given course. The percentage of final examination is\nTable 2.

The study assumes that the\nquestions that were asked in the quiz and final exam were extrapolated from the\ncourse content.\nData analysis\nThe relationship between the criteria and the success of students was analysed using\ntwo different prediction methods, a multiple-regression analysis technique and an\nANN model (multi-layer perception). These prediction methods have already been\nused in several comparative studies in different areas (Baker and Richards 1999;\nGaudart, Giusiano, and Huiart 2004; Guiterez-Estrada et al. 2004; Hardgrave, Wilson,\nand Walstrom 1994; Hyvarinen and Bingham 2003). Recent studies have considered\nANN as an alternative method of traditional data analysis techniques or perhaps\na  more-developed version of these techniques. Although the solution of an ANN\nmay  not be the optimum one, its results can be considered rather satisfactory as\ncompared with other traditional methods (Hertz, Krogh, and Palmer 1994; Oztemel\n2003).\nThe ANN prediction models used in the current study are presented below. The\nmodels\u2019 network typology consists of three layers, namely input, hidden, and output\nlayers. In the first model, the input and the hidden layers have five nodes each while\nthe output has one node only (see Figure 1). The second model\u2019s typology consists of\none input node, one hidden node, and five output nodes (see Figure 2).\nFigure 1. Typology of feed-forward neural network model.2 back-for ard neural net ork odel.\nNumerical illustrations\nThis section provides some illustrations with regards to the implementation of the two\nprediction models on the dataset as well as the associated results obtained from the\nanalyses.\nFigure 1. Typology of feed-forward neural network model.\n26  H.I. Cebeci et al.\nMultiple-regression model\nAfter employing the regression analysis, the coefficient of determination (R2) was\nfound to be 0.8067 and it indicated that the five criteria used in the model can explain\n80.67% of average grade points of all courses. The resulting F-value, which was\n15.859 with a probability of 0.00003, leads us to reject the null hypothesis (H0: The\nregression coefficients of the model are all equal to each other that have a value of\nzero). Furthermore, a t-test analysis was performed within a 95% level of confidence\nto check whether the regression coefficients were significant or not. The results of the\nt-test can be seen in Table 3. In the table, X1, X2, X3, X4, and X5 were used to refer\nto the length of the text, the usage of examples and applications, exercises and home-\nwork, multimedia applications, visual integrity respectively.\nAs it can be seen from the Table 3, all coefficients are statistically significant.\nTherefore, the regression model can be as follows: \nThe expected and the obtained values were compared using a t-test, and it was\nconcluded that there is no statistical difference between them (t = \u22120.006, p = 0.99).\ny x x x x x= + + + + -2 9125 3 8187 0 4530 1 4641 3 1639 21 6215 11 2 3 4 5. . . . . .

It can also be concluded that the most effective\nfactor is the usage of examples and applications.\nMulti-layer perceptron models\nThe ANN prediction model was designed in two different ways. It can be applied in a\nway similar to that of the multiple-regression model, which considers the instructional\ndesign factors as input and then tries to predict average grade points. It can also be\napplied inversely, where the average grade points are used as an input and therefore\nending with the instructional design factors as an output. In the following sections, the\nimplementation of these models on the selected data will be demonstrated.\nFeed-forward prediction\nThe first ANN model predicts the average grade points via the multi-layer perceptron\nmethod. Hence, the dataset was scaled within the interval of 0\u20131. The dataset was\ndivided into three sub-sets, the training set, the test set, and validation set. Accordingly,\nthe data collected from the 25 samples were divided into 10 training, five test, and 10\nvalidation sub-sets. For homogeneity purposes, the dataset was divided over the\ncourses in the three divisions. Given the unavailability of a large sample, the error\nvalue was selected as high as 0.07. Table 4 shows the prediction input sets, the\nexpected outputs, the predicted outputs and the error percentage, which represents the\ndifference between the prediction results and the expected values.\nAfter a series of simulation studies, the network reached 100% learning and 100%\ntest success in the 100000th iteration with a learning coefficient of 35% and a momen-\ntum coefficient of 75%. In order to evaluate whether there was a significant difference\nbetween the expected and the predicted values, a t-test analysis was performed. The\nt-test value (t = 0.04, p = 0.96) revealed statistically significant results.\nIt is possible to see from Table 4 that the predicted values are close to their corre-\nsponding expected values. Only for the second and the fourth cases, the error values\nTable 4.

Cebeci et al.\nare slightly high. A reasonable explanation for this could be that the sample size for\ntraining was not large enough. Even though sample size for training was not sufficient,\nthe worst prediction result of the network had 7.8% of error value. Hence, it can be\nsaid that multi-layer perceptron model was performed successfully.\nBack-forward prediction\nIn this part of the study, the second network model uses the first model\u2019s inputs as\noutput and ends up with the inputs of the previous model. When the previous output\nvalues were used as input, the network was able to produce the instructional design\nfactors\u2019 values for a desired interval value of an average grade point.\nSimilar to the first network model, a 0.07 error value was selected. The network\ntrained had a 100% of learning success and 35% and 75% of learning and momentum\ncoefficients respectively. With these parameters, the network produced the results as\nshown in Table 5.\nIn general, the model produced very close results to the expected values, except\nfor output 3. The reason for the high difference between the expected and the network\noutput is that output 3 had a wide range of value varieties, which caused a learning\nproblem in the network and an explanation difficulty.\nThe back-forward prediction model provides insights about the type of instruments\nthat should be included in the courses. For a desired success level, a reasonable combi-\nnation of the instructional design factors levels can be predicted.\nDiscussion\nThis study investigated the effects of instructional design factors on students\u2019 success\nusing multiple-regression and ANN approaches as prediction models. These models\nwere developed and compared using the same prediction dataset. The results indicated\nthat all of the five factors have positive effects on students\u2019 success.

By means of the multiple-regression and the feed-forward\nmulti-layer perceptron model, a decision concerning the predicted level of success of\na course can be made before displaying the course online. For example, necessary\nimprovements for a course can be taken into consideration during the pre-displaying\nprocess. These models can be used as a strategic tool to decide whether to present a\ncourse online or not as well as which aspects of it should be improved.\nTable 6 summarises the results of both models and the comparison between them,\nalong with their expected outputs based on the error values for the dataset.\nA paired t-test analysis was conducted to evaluate whether the results of\ntwo models were different from each other or not. According to the t-test results,\n(t = 0.696, p = 0.504), there was no statistical difference between the two models.\nHowever, it should be noted that the results of the second ANN model (back-\nforward) cannot be possible to be produced by the multiple-regression model. In this\nmanner, ANN models can be chosen instead of a multiple-regression approach due to\ntheir capability of giving different aspects of this kind of problem. The back-forward\nneural network prediction model stimulates us to look at the answers for the question\nof what design structure a course content should have to make the learning outcomes\nadequate for the students to lead them to success.\nThe contribution of this study is two-fold. By introducing the application of ANN\nto the design of learning environments, it might be possible for the researchers to\nintroduce new problem domains which utilise the capability of this technology. With\nregards to the contribution of the study for practitioners, the study brings out the impli-\ncations for an ongoing e-learning system. To be able to reach the highest success level\non student performance, several simulation studies can be performed by investigating\nthe effects of different success predictors, not just instructional design factors, on\nstudents\u2019 success. The simulation could be performed based on the feed-forward\nneural network model. Furthermore, the simulation can be expanded through the\nusage of back-forward network model by including the attributes of the learners\ntogether with the other success measurements. As a result of this, an appropriate\ndesign structure can be tailored for each group of learners.\nTable 6.

Cebeci et al.\nConclusion\nEven though the success of an e-learning system is explained by factors such as the\nnumber of students and lecturers in the system, their learning and teaching efficien-\ncies, and education technologies used, students\u2019 success level is another significant\nindicator. Students\u2019 success level is affected by socio-economic, demographic and\ninstructional design factors. In this study, only instructional design factors were inves-\ntigated. As a result of the study, it is recommended for instructional designers and\nlecturers to prepare course contents within a specified standardisation and to make\nefficient use of multimedia applications. Furthermore, visual design of a course should\nalways be taken into consideration.\nDuring this research, uncontrollable variables such as socio-economic and demo-\ngraphic factors, which are indirectly related to students\u2019 success, have not been\nconsidered. This remains a limitation of the study. For future work, a statistical anal-\nysis of how these factors affect the students\u2019 success can be investigated along with\nthe investigation that has been done in this study. Furthermore, as an indicator of\nsuccess, not only grade point averages but also some other success measurements after\ngraduation should also be included in further studies.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors would like to thank Sakarya University for their contribution by providing the\nvaluable data, which were taken from Sakarya University Distance Learning Project.\nReferences\nAngeli, C., and N.
