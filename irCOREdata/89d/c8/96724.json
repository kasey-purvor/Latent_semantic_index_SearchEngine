Introduction\nThe geometrical model for the steady growth of a single finger of a dendritic crystal\nwritten down by Brower et al. (1983) and analysed by Kruskal & Segur (1991) is\n\u000f2\u03c6\u2032\u2032\u2032 + \u03c6\u2032 = cos\u03c6, (1.1)\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u00b1pi\n2\nas s\u2192 \u00b1\u221e, (1.2)\nwhere s is arclength along the (two-dimensional) solid-liquid interface, \u03c6 is the\nangle that the normal to this interface makes with the x-axis (the direction of\npropagation of the finger), and \u2032 \u2261 d\/ds. As shown in Kruskal & Segur (1991), a\nna\u00a8\u0131ve asymptotic expansion\n\u03c6 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u000f2n\u03c6n, (1.3)\ncan be made to satisfy the equation and boundary conditions at each order. How-\never, there is in fact no solution to (1.1)-(1.2), as was proved rigorously by Amick\n& McLeod (1990). The series (1.3) diverges for any fixed values of \u000f > 0 and s.\nArticle submitted to Royal Society TEX Paper\n2 S. J. Chapman and D. B. Mortimer\nOptimally truncating this series at its least term reveals a Stokes line in the com-\nplex s-plane joining the points s = \u00b1ipi\/2,which are the complex singularities of\nthe leading-order approximation\n\u03c60 = \u2212pi\/2 + 2 tan\u22121 es. (1.4)\nAcross the Stokes line an exponentially small term \u201cbeyond all orders\u201d is switched\non as shown by Chapman et al. (1998). Although this term is exponentially small at\nthe origin where it is turned on, it grows exponentially as s\u2192\u221e and its presence\nmeans that the boundary conditions (1.2) cannot be satisfied.\nA natural question to ask now is, if we consider a time dependent problem which\nhas (1.1) as the steady state, what will the large-time behaviour be? There is no\nsteady finger solution, therefore, this cannot provide the large time behaviour. Since\nthe small exponential is oscillatory it is tempting to imagine that its presence is the\norigin of side branching in dendritic fingers.\nThe \u201ccorrect\u201d time-dependent generalisation of (1.1) is\nvn = \u03ba+ \u000f\n2\u03bass, (1.5)\nwhere \u03ba is the curvature and vn is the normal velocity of the solid-liquid inter-\nface Brower et al. (1983); solutions of (1.1) are travelling waves solutions of (1.5).\nHowever, we can ask the same questions about large-time behaviour for any time-\ndependent problem for which (1.1) gives the steady state. The simplest such equa-\ntion is\n\u03c6t \u2212 \u03c6s = \u000f2\u03c6sss \u2212 cos\u03c6. (1.6)\nThe beyond all orders analysis of equations such as (1.6) is an order of magnitude\nharder than that of (1.1) and has yet to be attempted in the literature. To gain some\ninsight and to illustrate the sort of issues which need to be addressed, we consider\nhere a linearised version of (1.6) which has the advantage that we can solve using\nthe Fourier transform to give the solution in the form of an integral. This exact\nsolution will provide a check on our direct asymptotic techniques, so that we have\nmore confidence in the latter when we move on to consider nonlinear equations, for\nwhich such an integral representation of the solution is usually lacking.\nThe specific linear problem we will consider is\n\u03c6t \u2212 \u03c6s = \u000f2\u03c6sss \u2212 1\n1 + s2\n, (1.7)\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u00b1pi\n2\nas s\u2192 \u00b1\u221e. (1.8)\nThe nonlinearity has been replaced by an inhomogeneous term which introduces\ncomplex singularities at s = \u00b1i into the solution corresponding to those at s =\n\u00b1ipi\/2 in the crystal growth problem. The inhomogeneous term has been chosen so\nthat the leading order steady solution is\n\u03c60 = tan\n\u22121 s, (1.9)\nwhich is simpler than (1.4) but of the same general form. The steady-state problem\n\u03c6s + \u000f\n2\u03c6sss =\n1\n1 + s2\n, (1.10)\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u00b1pi\n2\nas s\u2192 \u00b1\u221e, (1.11)\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nExponential asymptotics in a partial differential equation 3\nexhibits the same features as the crystal-growth problem in that a na\u00a8\u0131ve expansion\n\u03c6 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u000f2n\u03c6n, (1.12)\ncan be made to satisfy the equation and boundary conditions at every order. There\nis, however, a Stokes line between the singularities s = \u00b1i across which a sub-\ndominant exponential is switched on. In this case the exponential is oscillating but\nnot growing or decaying at infinity, though this still fails to satisfy the boundary\nconditions (1.11) and thus rules out a steady finger solution. The initial condition\nis not so important for our analysis, but we choose to use the leading-order steady\nstate\n\u03c6(s, 0) = tan\u22121 s, (1.13)\nso that we are starting close to a finger solution and seeing how it will evolve.\nIn Section 2 we solve (1.7)-(1.8), (1.13) exactly using the Fourier transform and\nasymptotically evaluate the resulting integrals as \u000f \u2192 0 using steepest descents.\nWe determine the Stokes lines in real and complex (s, t)-space and the form of the\nsolution in each region.\nIn Section 3 we analyse the equation asymptotically by truncating the asymp-\ntotic series (1.12) and examining the behaviour of the remainder. We show that\nthe exponentials are smoothly switched on across the Stokes lines in exactly the\nmanner discovered by Berry (1989) for linear o.d.e.s. Here in order to calculate\nthese exponentials we follow the framework of matched asymptotic expansions set\nout by Daalhuis et al. (1995).\nThe crucial step in using optimal truncation in order to examine the remainder\nterm is to find the late terms, that is, to determine \u03c6(n) in the limit n\u2192\u221e. For this\nparticular problem we are able to determine each term in the series exactly and then\napproximate the series in the large n limit. In doing this we encounter a phenomenon\nwhich we shall call a higher-order Stokes line. Across this line contributions to\nthe approximation of the late terms are switched on and off. Thus a higher-order\nStokes line switches on or off Stokes lines themselves. The higher-order Stokes\nline is associated with what we shall call second-generation Stokes switching; a\nsubdominant exponential switched on across a Stokes line is a divergent asymptotic\nseries which itself switches on further terms beyond all orders. This is origin of the\n\u2018new\u2019 Stokes lines discussed by Berk et al. (1982) and the \u2018vanishing\u2019 Stokes lines\ndiscussed by Aoki et al. (1998).\nWe aim to use our techniques on nonlinear problems where an exact represen-\ntation of the terms \u03c6(n) will not in general be available. With this end in mind,\nin Section 5 we try to obtain the late terms using a WKBJ type ansatz of the\nform factorial\/power, as has been done by Chapman et al. (1998) for nonlinear\nordinary differential equations. We will find that determining the \u201cphase\u201d of the\napproximation is possible (but not straightforward, since the boundary data may\nbe given on a characteristic of the resulting eikonal equation), but that determining\nthe premultiplying amplitude involves solving an inner problem analogous to the\ninner diffraction problems that arise in the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (see\nKeller (1958, 1962)).\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n4 S. J. Chapman and D. B. Mortimer\nFinally, we note that in a companion paper, Howls et al. (2005) consider the\nsame differential equation (1.7) using hyperasymptotics and Borel transforms; there\nthe higher-order Stokes line manifests itself in the location of branch points in the\nBorel plane.\n2. Asymptotic analysis of the exact solution\n(a) Exact solution by Fourier transform\nConsider the equation (1.10) with boundary condition (1.11) and initial condi-\ntion (1.13), with 0 < \u000f\u001c 1. Defining the Fourier transform as\n\u03c6\u02c6 =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03c6 eiksds, (2.1)\ntaking the Fourier transform of (1.10)-(1.11), (1.13) gives\n\u03c6\u02c6t + ik\u03c6\u02c6 = \u000f\n2ik3\u03c6\u02c6\u2212 pie\u2212|k|, \u03c6\u02c6(0) = ipi\nk\ne\u2212|k|.\nHence\n\u03c6\u02c6 =\nipie\u2212|k|\nk(1\u2212 \u000f2k2)\n(\n1\u2212 \u000f2k2e\u2212ik(1\u2212\u000f2k2)t\n)\n. (2.2)\nThe inversion formula now gives\n\u03c6 = Is + It, (2.3)\nwith\nIs =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nie(\u2212|p|\u2212ips)\/\u000f\n2p(1\u2212 p2) dp, (2.4)\nIt =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212ip\n2(1\u2212 p2) exp\n((\u2212|p| \u2212 ip(1\u2212 p2)t\u2212 ips) \/\u000f) dp, (2.5)\nwhere, in anticipation of the approximation by steepest descents as \u000f\u2192 0 to follow,\nwe have put p = k\u000f. For the integrals along the real axis to exist we require \u22121 \u2264\nIm(s) \u2264 1. Note that although the singularities of \u03c6\u02c6 at p = \u00b11 are removeable, so\nthat \u03c6\u02c6 does not have any poles, when we split the integral into Is and It there are\npoles in each integrand (with equal and opposite residues). We choose to indent the\ncontours of integration clockwise around the poles at p = \u22121 and p = 1 in both\nintegrals, so that the pole contributions cancel initially (this will be true as long\nas we indent the same way in both integrals). Note that the first integral Is is a\nsteady-state solution of equation (1.10), but we shall see that it does not satisfy\nthe boundary conditions (1.11).\n(b) Approximation of the exact solution\n(i) Non-time dependent integrals\nWe first consider the steady-state solution Is. By partial fractions we find\nIs =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nsin\n(ps\n\u000f\n) e\u2212p\/\u000f\np\ndp+ Is1 + Is2, (2.6)\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nExponential asymptotics in a partial differential equation 5\nwhere\nIs1 =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nip e\u2212p(1+is)\/\u000f\n2(1\u2212 p2) dp, Is2 = \u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nip e\u2212p(1\u2212is)\/\u000f\n2(1\u2212 p2) dp, (2.7)\nwhere we have removed the modulus sign by splitting the range of integration and\nputting p \u2192 \u2212p in the integral over (\u2212\u221e, 0). The contour is indented clockwise\naround p = 1 in Is1 and anti-clockwise around p = 1 in Is2.\nThe first integral in (2.6) can be evaluated exactly by noting that\n\u2202\n\u2202s\n(\u222b \u221e\n0\nsin\n(ps\n\u000f\n) e\u2212p\/\u000f\np\ndp\n)\n=\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ncos\n(ps\n\u000f\n)\ne\u2212p\/\u000f\ndp\n\u000f\n=\n1\n1 + s2\n. (2.8)\nThus \u222b \u221e\n0\nsin\n(ps\n\u000f\n) e\u2212p\/\u000f\np\ndp = tan\u22121 s. (2.9)\nNoting that there are no saddle points in Is1 , we apply the method of steepest\ndescents as \u000f\u2192 0 to the integral Is1 . We get no pole contribution when the indented\ncontour can be deformed into the steepest descent contour arg(p(1+is)) = 0 without\npassing through p = 1. This is the case for Re(s) < 0. When Re(s) = 0 the steepest\ndescent contour arg p = 0 passes through the pole, while for Re(s) > 0 the steepest\ndescent contour must be indented to include a clockwise circuit around the pole\n(Figure 1). Thus, as the real part of s increases through zero we pick up an extra\nPSfrag replacements\nIm(p)Im(p)\nRe(p)Re(p)\ns = \u22120.2 s = 0.2\nFigure 1.

Combining these, we see that as we cross Re(s) = 0 a contribution\n\u03c6p = \u03c6p1 + \u03c6p2 = \u2212pie\u22121\/\u000f cos\n(s\n\u000f\n)\n, (2.12)\nis switched on. In addition the end point contributions from Is1 and Is2 are\n\u03c6se = \u03c6se1 + \u03c6se2 \u223c i\u000f\n2\n2(1 + is)2\n\u2212 i\u000f\n2\n2(1\u2212 is)2 , (2.13)\nand are present everywhere.\n(ii) Time dependent integrals\nWe now consider the integral It. We again remove the modulus sign in the\nintegral by splitting the range of integration and putting k \u2192 \u2212k in the integral\nover (\u2212\u221e, 0), to give\nIt = It1 + It2, (2.14)\nwhere\nIt1 =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u2212ip e\u2212f(p)\/\u000f\n2(1\u2212 p2) dp, It2 =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nip e\u2212f\u00af(p)\/\u000f\n2(1\u2212 p2) dp, (2.15)\nwhere\nf(p) = ips+ p+ ip(1\u2212 p2)t, (2.16)\na bar denotes complex conjugation, and the contour is indented clockwise around\np = 1 in It1 and anticlockwise around p = 1 in It2. We apply the method of\nsteepest descent to It1 as \u000f\u2192 0. In addition to the endpoint at p = 0 and the poles\nat p = \u00b11, there are now two saddle points to consider, at\np = ps\u00b1 = \u00b1\n(\ns+ t\u2212 i\n3t\n)1\/2\n. (2.17)\nWe wish to know which of these five possible contributions is present in the expan-\nsion of the integral at each point in the (s, t)-plane. There can only be a change\nin the set of contributions across Stokes lines, where the contour through one of\nthese points passes through another. Since there can therefore only be a Stokes line\nwhere two contributions have the same phase, we first consider the equal phase\nlines associated with each pair of contributions.\nThere are three possible Stokes switchings, as listed below.\n1. The contribution from a pole may be switched on or off by the contour\nthrough the end point\nWhen the steepest descent contour through the end point crosses a pole the con-\ntribution from the pole will be switched on or off. On the line where this happens\nthe phases of the end point and pole contributions are equal, i.e. Im(f(\u00b11)) =\nIm(f(0)). Thus \u00b1 Im(is + 1) = 0, that is Re(s) = 0.

As s crosses this line (corresponding to the solid black line in Figure 2)\nthe saddle ps+ is picked up by the steepest descent curve (see point b), and the\nsaddle point contribution is switched on. To leading-order, this contribution is\n\u03c6s1 \u223c e\n3ipi\/4\n\u221a\npi\u000f (3t)1\/4(s+ t\u2212 i)1\/4\n2(2t\u2212 s+ i) exp\n(\n\u2212 i\n\u000f\n\u221a\n4(s+ t\u2212 i)3\n27t\n)\n. (2.21)\nNote that this contribution has a singularity at s = 2t + i corresponding to the\nsaddle point coalescing with a pole. Also the exponent of \u03c6s1 has a branch point at\ns = \u2212t+ i corresponding to the saddle point coalescescing with the end point.\nWe see that no new contribution is switched on or off across s = 0 (the long\ndashed line in Figure 2, see point d) so this line is inactive. The endpoint and\nthe pole have the same phase at this point, but they are not \u201cadjacent\u201d. Finally\na contribution from the pole at p = 1 is switched on as the contour through the\nsaddle point crosses it, (corresponding to the short dashed line in Figure 2, see\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nExponential asymptotics in a partial differential equation 9\npoint e).

Here the steepest descent contour through the\nendpoint crosses the pole, and the pole contribution is switched off.\nNote that as s crosses the short dashed line in Figure 2 (point k) no further\nswitching occurs. Across this line the steepest descent path though the saddle\ncrosses the pole. However, the integration contour does not go through the sad-\ndle point; there is no saddle point contribution to switch on the pole.\nThus, our final Stokes line picture in real (s, t)-space is as shown in Figure 5,\nwhere we have set \u03c6te = \u03c6te1 + \u03c6te2 and \u03c6s = \u03c6s1 + \u03c6s2.\nConsider now the integral It2.

Stokes lines in real space.\nThere are two aspects of the Stokes line structure that require further comment,\neven though neither is central to the analysis in the present paper. The first is the\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nExponential asymptotics in a partial differential equation 11\nfact that the solid black Stokes line, across which the endpoint switches on the\nsaddle point, intersects the t = 0 axis. However, we know that the solution at t = 0\nis simply the initial condition tan\u22121 s, which has a truncating series in \u000f (of one\nterm), and thus cannot exhibit Stokes phenomenon.\nThe resolution of this apparent paradox can be seen by examining the position\nof the saddle point in the integral It1, which we found to be\nps =\n(\ns+ t\u2212 i\n3t\n)1\/2\n. (2.26)\nWe see that this saddle comes in from infinity at t = 0+. If we repeat our steepest\ndescent analysis for t = O(\u000f) we will find endpoint and pole contributions as before,\nbut no saddle point in the integral. Thus there is a boundary layer at t = 0 in which\nthe saddle point and Stokes line appear.\nThe saddle point contribution switched on across the Stokes line,\n\u03c6s \u223c \u2212\n\u221a\npi\u000f(3t)1\/4\n2\n(\ne3ipi\/4\n(s\u2212 i)3\/4 exp\n(\n\u2212 i\n\u000f\n\u221a\n4(s\u2212 i)3\n27t\n)\n+\ne\u22123ipi\/4\n(s+ i)3\/4\nexp\n(\ni\n\u000f\n\u221a\n4(s+ i)3\n27t\n))\n,\nas t\u2192 0. Thus this term tends to zero exponentially quickly as t\u2192 0.\nThis phenomenon of a saddle suddenly appearing from infinity at t = 0+ will\nbe generic in problems of this type. It occurs because the third derivative in the\nequation gives a term tk3 in the exponent of the Fourier transform, while the initial\ndata gives an exponent linear in k for large k. Thus there are two more saddle\npoints when t > 0 than when t = 0.\nThe second aspect on which we need to comment is the existence of Stokes lines\nparallel to the real s-axis (the second solution in (2.19)). Although these Stokes lines\ndo not intersect the real axis for finite s, the Stokes lines have a width which grows\nlinearly in s (away from the generating singularity). Thus for large s the parallel\nStokes lines will eventually impinge on the real axis, and will affect the behaviour\nof the solution at infinity (see King (1998) for an example of this phenomenon in\nan o.d.e.). This corresponds to rescaling for large s in the integrals It1 and It2 and\nrepeating the steepest descent analysis.\nNeither of these issues is central to the analysis in this paper, which is concerned\nwith the Stokes line structure for s and t of O(1), and we will not consider them\nfurther.\n(c) The Borel plane\nThe Stokes structure determined in the previous section can be conveniently\nillustrated in terms of the Borel plane. Such an approach has been taken in Howls\net al. (2005), to which the interested reader is referred for the details. Here we\nmerely give a sketch of the behaviour for illustrative purposes.\nIn the Borel plane the integrals are of the form\u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u2212z\/\u000fF (z, s, t) dz,\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n12 S.

We will focus on It, for which z = p(1 + is) + ip(1 \u2212 p2)t.\nThe endpoint corresponds to z = ze = 0, the pole to z = zp = z|p=1 and the saddle\nto z = zs = z|p=ps where p = ps is the solution of dz\/dp = 0. The point z = zs\nis a square root branch point of f so that the relevant section of the Borel plane\nis a two sheeted Riemann surface, cut from zs to infinity along arg(z) = arg(zs).\nThe higher-order Stokes phenomenon (which we will describe in Section c) occurs\nwhen the three points ze, zp and zs are colinear, and zp passes from one sheet of\nthe Riemann surface to another. The steepest descent paths in the Borel plane lie\nparallel to the real axis. The endpoint is always the dominant contribution. Unless\nt > 0 is small or |s| is large the largest subdominant exponential comes from the\nsaddle point, and the pole contribution is subdominant with respect to the saddle\npoint contribution, i.e. Re(zs) < Re(zp). We assume that s and t are such that this\nis the case.\nLet us now look at the positions of zs and zp as s increases from \u2212\u221e to \u221e\nalong the real axis for fixed t.\nFor t < 1\/\n\u221a\n3, starting with large negative s we have arg zs < arg zp < 0 (Figure\n7a). As s increases arg zs and arg zp increase and at s = 0, zp crosses the real axis,\nand therefore the integration contour from the endpoint (Figure 7b). This switches\non the pole contribution. When s = 1\/\n\u221a\n3 \u2212 t, zs crosses the real axis. Since the\nsaddle point is a branch point of the Riemann surface, the integration to infinity\non the real axis is now on the wrong sheet, and we need to integrate back around\nthe branch point by integrating from\u221e+ i arg(zs) to zs as illustrated in Figure 7c.\nThis extra integration is the saddle point contribution.\nFor t > 1\/\n\u221a\n3, starting with large negative s we again have arg zs < arg zp < 0\n(Figure 8a). Now as we increase s, when s reaches s1, the smallest root of (3.20),\narg(zp \u2212 zs) = 0. Since Re(zp) > Re(zs) the pole crosses the branch cut in the\nRiemann surface and moves onto the lower Riemann sheet, as illustrated in Figure\n8b. As s increases further arg zs and arg zp continue to increase and this time arg zs\nreaches zero first, at s = 1\/\n\u221a\n3 \u2212 t < 0. We now have an integration path around\nthe branch point along Im(z) = Im(zs) as above (Figure 8c).\nNow when s = 0, zp crosses the real axis. But because the integration contour\nfrom ze is on the upper Riemann sheet, and zp is on the lower Riemann sheet, it\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nExponential asymptotics in a partial differential equation 13\n(d)\nzs\nzpze\ne(z)\nIm(z)\n(a)\ne(z)\nze\nzs\nzp\nIm(z)\n(c)\nzs\nzp\nze\ne(z)\nIm(z)\n(f)\nzs\nzp\nze\ne(z)\nIm(z)\n(b)\ne(z)\nzs\nzp\nze\nIm(z)\n(e)\nzs zp\nze\ne(z)\nIm(z)\nFigure 8.

Thus no pole\ncontribution is turned on (Figure 8d).\nAs s increases further Im(zp\u2212zs) increases, until at s = s2 say Im(zp) = Im(zs)\nand the pole crosses the new integration contour around the branch point. This is\nthe saddle point turning on the pole contribution (Figure 8e).\nAs s increases further arg(zp \u2212 zs) increases until at s = s3, the second root of\n(3.20), arg(zp \u2212 zs) = 0 and zp passes back through the branch point to reemerge\non the top Riemann sheet (Figure 8f). The pole has then effectively emerged on the\nother side of the line of integration 0 \u2264 Re(z) \u2264 \u221e, Im(z) = 0, without actually\ncrossing it.\nThe solution of (1.10)-(1.11) by Fourier transform, and the interpretation of\nthe resulting integrals in the Borel plane works exceedingly well for this problem.\nHowever, while this approach is very powerful when applicable, for non-constant-\ncoefficient linear equations the equation for the Fourier transform of the solution will\nnot be solvable in general, while for nonlinear equations the Fourier transform itself\nis not applicable. We expect nonlinear equations such as (1.6) to exhibit similar\npatterns of Stokes switching, and we wish to develop techniques for determining\nthe Stokes structure of such problems.\nWhile an integral representation of the solution will not be available in general,\nthe asymptotic expansion of the dominant exponential is available, even for nonlin-\near problems. Our aim in Sections 3-5 is to see if we can recover the Stokes structure\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n14 S. J. Chapman and D. B. Mortimer\nilluminated in Section 2 without using the integral representation of the solution,\nbut working directly with the asymptotic series for the dominant exponential. As\nwell as giving a different interpretation of higher-order Stokes phenomenon, such\ntechniques may be more readily applicable to nonlinear problems.\n3. Asymptotic analysis of the equation directly\nHaving determined the Stokes structure of the problem we shall now reproduce\nthese results using perturbation expansions and optimal truncation, without using\nthe integral formulation of the solution. As we have just discussed, the techniques\nof this and the following sections may be more readily applicable to nonlinear\nproblems, where an integral formulation of the solution may not be readily available.\nThe first step in the procedure is to determine the asymptotic behaviour of\nthe late terms in the asymptotic expansion of \u03c6, which we do in this section. The\nsecond step is to optimally truncate the series for \u03c6 and study the behaviour of the\nremainder, which we do in Section 4.\n(a) A na\u00a8\u0131ve perturbation expansion\nWe begin by seeking a na\u00a8\u0131ve perturbation expansion\n\u03c6 \u223c\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u000f2n\u03c6(n).

We now deform the contour to the steepest descent contour (making sure\nwe still go through the \u201cendpoint\u201d v = 1, so that we do not pick up any more of\nthe poles on the real axis). There is one saddle point, which may or may not be\non the integration contour, depending on the value of \u03c4\/\u03c3. Two typical contours\nare shown in Figure 10. Note that there are branch points at v = 0 and v = \u22122,\nand poles on the real axis at z = k and z = \u22122n\u2212 k, k = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . The deformed\ncontour crosses the real axis with \u22122 < v < 0, so that we don\u2019t pick up any extra\npole contributions, and the branch cut from v = \u22122 has no effect.

There is a Stokes line when the contour through the endpoint C3 goes\nthrough the saddle point. This Stokes line is given by\nIm(f(1)) = Im(f(vs)), i.e. Im\n(\nlog\n( \u03c4\n\u03c3\n))\n= Im\n(\nlog\n(\n\u03c3\n\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c4\n)2)\n. (3.19)\nFor s and t real this implies\n1 + s4 \u2212 3t2 \u2212 2st3 + s2(2\u2212 3t2) = 0. (3.20)\nThus the saddle point only contributes when t and s are such that we are at a point\nbelow this curve, which is shown in Figure 11. This Stokes line is not a Stokes line in\nthe approximation of the solution of the original p.d.e., which we examined in \u00a72 and\nacross which \u03c6e turns on \u03c6s and \u03c6p; rather it is a Stokes line in the approximation\nof the late terms in the full expansion of the dominant contribution \u03c6e. We shall\ncall such a Stokes line a higher-order Stokes line. Let us see how condition (3.19)\nPSfrag replacements\n0\n1\n1 2\u22122 \u22121\ns\nt\nFigure 11.

When these late terms are\nBorel summed the corresponding singularities in the Borel plane are\nzp =\nief(vs)\/2\n\u03c3\nand zs =\nief(1)\/2\n\u03c3\nrespectively. These are colinear with ze = 0 when arg(zp) = arg(zs), i.e.\narg\n(\nief(vs)\/2\n\u03c3\n)\n= arg\n(\nief(1)\/2\n\u03c3\n)\n,\nwhich is equivalent to (3.19).\nReturning to approximation of the integral I, we find that there is an anti-\nStokes line when the contribution from the endpoint C3 and the contribution from\nthe saddle point change in dominance. Again, this is not an anti-Stokes line of the\napproximation of the original p.d.e., which would occur when \u03c6s and \u03c6p change in\ndominance, but an anti-Stokes line in the approximation of the late terms of the\nfull expansion of \u03c6e. This higher order anti-Stokes line is given by\nRe (f(1)) = Re (f(vs)) , i.e. Re\n(\nlog\n(\n27\u03c4\n\u03c3\n))\n= Re\n(\nlog\n(\n4\u03c32\n(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c4)2\n))\n.(3.21)\nThe saddle point contribution is dominant when t and s are such that we are at a\npoint below the dashed curve shown in Figure 11.\nCombining the expressions for IC1 and IC3 with (3.13) we have\n\u03c6(n) \u223c\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\ni(\u22121)n(2n\u2212 1)!\n2(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c4)2n \u2212\ni\u03c3(\u22121)n(2n\u2212 1)!\n2\n\u221a\n3pin(3\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c3)\n(\n27\u03c4\n4\u03c33\n)n\nabove the Stokes line,\n\u2212 i\u03c3(\u22121)\nn(2n\u2212 1)!\n2\n\u221a\n3pin(3\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c3)\n(\n27\u03c4\n4\u03c33\n)n\nbelow the Stokes line,\nWe write\n\u03c6(n) = \u03c6\n(n)\ne1 \u223c S\ni(\u22121)n(2n\u2212 1)!\n2(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c4)2n \u2212\ni\u03c3(\u22121)n(2n\u2212 1)!\n2\n\u221a\n3pin(3\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c3)\n(\n27\u03c4\n4\u03c33\n)n\n(3.22)\n= S\u03c6(n)1 + \u03c6(n)2 , (3.23)\nwhere the Stokes multiplier S is zero below the Stokes line and unity above it. We\nemphasize here that the asymptotic approximation in (3.22) is as n\u2192\u221e, and that\nthe Stokes switching in \u03c6(n) refers to this limit, in contrast to the Stokes switching of\n\u03c6, which refers to the limit \u000f\u2192 0 (remember also that \u03c6(n) is independent of \u000f). Note\nalso that \u03c6\n(n)\n1 and \u03c6\n(n)\n2 are only defined by (3.23) in the limit as n\u2192\u221e. To allow\nus to define our truncation procedure we write \u03c6 = \u03c61 +\u03c62, with \u03c6\n(n) = \u03c6\n(n)\n1 +\u03c6\n(n)\n2\nfor all n, where the definition of \u03c6\n(n)\n1 and \u03c6\n(n)\n2 is arbitrary, except in the limit of\nlarge n.\n4. Stokes smoothing\nHaving determined the form of the late terms of the asymptotic series of \u03c6, we can\nnow truncate the series and study the behaviour of the remainder as in Daalhuis\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nExponential asymptotics in a partial differential equation 21\net al. (1995); Chapman et al. (1998). In this way we will observe the Stokes switching\ndirectly through a smoothing of the Stokes discontinuities.\nWe consider the tails of the series \u03c6\n(n)\n1 and \u03c6\n(n)\n2 in (3.22) separately.

The original asymptotic series for \u03c6 (3.1), (3.13) cannot pick this up, since\nit corresponds to the endpoint contribution from the integral formulation. This\nextra Stokes line arises because, unlike \u03c6p1, R2 = \u03c6\n(0)\ns1 (which corresponds to the\nsaddle point contribution) does not satisfy the equation R2\u03c4 = \u000f\n2R2\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3 exactly,\nbut only to the first two orders in \u000f. Thus we have found only the leading term\nin the asymptotic expansion of R2. This expansion is divergent, and will itself be\nresponsible for turning on subdominant terms through Stokes phenomenon.\nTo see the saddle point contribution switch on the pole contribution we write\nR2 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nA(\u03c3, \u03c4)(n)\u000fn+1\/2 e\u2212iu\/\u000f, (4.25)\nwhere\nA(0) =\n\u221a\npi e3ipi\/4 (3\u03c3\u03c4)\n1\/4\n2 (3\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c3) and u =\n\u221a\n4\u03c33\n27\u03c4\n.

Direct application of \u2018factorial over power\u2019 ansatz\nAlthough \u03c6(n) can be obtained exactly in the present case for all n, this is unlikely\nto be possible in general, even for linear equations. Since to identify the Stokes\nstructure all we need is the asymptotic behaviour of \u03c6(n) for large n, it is there-\nfore natural to ask whether this can be obtained directly, that is, whether we can\napproximate the equation for \u03c6(n) for large n and then solve, rather than solv-\ning exactly and then approximating. In this section, we examine the possibilities\nand difficulties of obtaining the late terms through a direct application of a facto-\nrial\/power ansatz, as is possible for ordinary differential equations (see Chapman\net al.

Since changing the sign of u simply\nmultiplies the function A by a constant, without loss of generality we can take\nu = \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c4.

Changing variables by writing\n\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c4 = \u000fz, (5.11)\n\u03c3 \u2212 3\u03c4 = y, (5.12)\n\u03c6 = \u2212 i\n2\nlog \u000f\u2212 i\n2\n\u03c8, (5.13)\nto leading-order equation (1.10) becomes\n\u03c8zzz + \u03c8z \u2212 1\nz\n= 0. (5.14)\nTo match with the outer solution we expand \u03c8 as z \u2192\u221e as\n\u03c8 = log z +\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nan(y)\nz2n\n, (5.15)\nwhere the an satisfy\nan + (2n\u2212 2)(2n\u2212 1)an\u22121 = 0, (5.16)\na1 = 1. (5.17)\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n30 S. J. Chapman and D. B. Mortimer\nHence\nan = (\u22121)n+1\u0393(2n). (5.18)\nThis is the outer limit of the one-term inner expansion. To match we calculate the\none-term inner limit of the outer expansion (5.1). In the inner coordinates\n\u000f2n\u03c6(n) \u223c A(y)\u0393(2n)(\u22121)\nn\nz2n\n.\nMatching now gives A = i\/2, so that\n\u03c6(n) \u223c i(\u22121)\nn\u0393(2n)\n2(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c4)2n .\nThus we have been able to obtain the later terms \u03c6\n(n)\n1 without any difficulty.\n(b) Moving singularity\nTo determine the late terms generated by the moving singularity we must impose\nu0 = 0, \u03c30 = 0, \u03c40 = S. (5.19)\nUnfortunately (5.6) then gives p0 = q0 = 0, and the rays never make it away from\nthe boundary. This occurs because the boundary curve is a characteristic of the\nequation.\nThe solution we require must be in the form of a fan of rays, all emanating from\nthe initiation of the singularity at \u03c3 = 0, \u03c4 = 0. To find such a solution we must\ndrop the second boundary condition (5.6) and impose instead that all the rays go\nthrough \u03c3 = 0, \u03c4 = 0. Thus in (5.5) we have u0 = \u03c30 = \u03c40 = 0, but q0 is arbitrary.\nEliminating q0 gives\nu =\n(\n4\u03c33\n27\u03c4\n)1\/2\n, (5.20)\nwhere, as before, we have taken the plus sign without loss of generality. The equation\nfor \u03b3 then becomes\n\u03b3\u03c4 +\n\u03c3\n\u03c4\n\u03b3\u03c3 = 0, (5.21)\nand the equation for A is\nA\u03c4 +\n\u03c3\n\u03c4\nA\u03c3 +\n1\n2\u03c4\nA = 0. (5.22)\nHence \u03b3 = \u03b3(\u03c3\/\u03c4) and A = \u03c4\u22121\/2B(\u03c3\/\u03c4) and we have\n\u03c6(n) \u223c B\n(\u03c3\n\u03c4\n)\n(\u22121)n\u0393(2n+ \u03b3(\u03c3\/\u03c4))\u221a\n\u03c4\n(\n27\u03c4\n4\u03c33\n)n+ \u03b3(\u03c3\/\u03c4)2\n. (5.23)\nAs \u03c3 \u2192 0, \u03c6(1) \u223c i\/2\u03c32. For this to agree with (5.23) requires \u03b3(0) = \u22121\/2, and\nB(y) \u223c y1\/4 as y \u2192 0. To determine the functions \u03b3 and B we need to match with\nan inner region in the vicinity of the singularity as before.\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nExponential asymptotics in a partial differential equation 31\nWe introduce the inner coordinates\ny =\n\u03c3\n\u03c4\n,\n\u000fz =\n(\n4\u03c33\n27\u03c4\n)1\/2\n= u,\n\u03c6 = \u2212 i\n2\nlog \u000f+\ni\u03c8\n2\n.\nThe leading-order inner problem is\n2y\u03c8y +\n\u03c8z\n9z\n(9z2 \u2212 1) + 2y\u03c8yz\n3z\n+ \u03c8zz +\n8y3\u03c8yyy\n27z2\n+\n4y2\u03c8zyy\n3z\n+ 2y\u03c8zzy + z\u03c8zzz +\ni\ny \u2212 1 = 0.\nExpanding for large z gives\n\u03c8 = \u2212 log\n(\n33\/2z(y \u2212 1)\n2y3\/2\n)\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nBn(y)\nz2n\n, (5.24)\nwhere\n\u2212yB\u2032n + nBn = \u2212\n4(3n\u2212 1)(3n\u2212 2)(n\u2212 1)\n9\nBn\u22121 +\n4(n\u2212 1)(3n\u2212 2)\n3\nyB\u2032n\u22121\n\u2212 4(n\u2212 1)\n3\ny2B\u2032\u2032n\u22121 +\n4\n27\ny3B\u2032\u2032\u2032n\u22121, n \u2265 2, (5.25)\n\u2212yB\u20321 +B1 = \u2212\n8y3\n27(y \u2212 1)3 . (5.26)\nThe boundary conditions on these equations come from the initial condition on the\nequation, since \u03c4 = 0 is contained in the inner region. Since the initial condition is\ntaken care of by the logarithm in (5.24), the remaining terms must be zero on the\nboundary \u03c4 = 0. This translates to the condition that\nBn = o(y\nn) as y \u2192\u221e. (5.27)\nThe late terms will be of the form\nBn(y) \u223c (\u22121)n\u0393(2n\u2212 1\/2)b(y),\nbut unfortunately b(y) cannot be determined by applying this late terms ansatz to\n(5.25) (on applying the ansatz and equating coefficients of powers of n, b(y) remains\narbitrary).\nThe solution for Bn may be written as\nBn(y) =\n(\u22121)n\u0393(2n)4ny3n\n27n(y \u2212 1)2n +\n(\u22121)n+1\u0393(2n)4n\n27n\nn\u22121\u2211\nj=0\nan,j y\nn\u2212j , (5.28)\nwhere\nj(2n\u2212 2)(2n\u2212 1)an,j = (2n+ j \u2212 1)(2n+ j \u2212 2)(2n+ j \u2212 3)an\u22121,j\u22121, (5.29)\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n32 S. J. Chapman and D. B. Mortimer\nand, to satisfy the initial condition,\nan,0 = 1. (5.30)\nThus\nan,j =\n\u0393(2n+ j)\n\u0393(2n)\u0393(j + 1)\n.\nMatching now requires a steepest descents analysis of (5.28), exactly as in Section\nb. Of course, we have simply reconstructed the solution of Section b in a different\nset of coordinates. The reason for this is obvious when we note that in the inner\nregion, where y and z are O(1), \u03c3 and \u03c4 are both O(\u000f). Writing \u03c3 = \u000f\u03c3\u00af, \u03c4 = \u000f\u03c4\u00af the\ninner equation is\n\u03c6\u03c4\u00af = \u03c6\u03c3\u00af\u03c3\u00af\u03c3\u00af +\ni\n2(\u03c3\u00af \u2212 \u03c4\u00af) . (5.31)\nThus in fact we retrieve the full problem, with \u000f simply scaled out of the equation.\nThis happens because of the particularly simple equation we are considering, and\nwill not be true in general.\nBoth the static singularity, \u03c3 = \u03c4 , and the moving singularity, \u03c3 = 0, are in\nthe inner region. This is associated with the fact that u is given by a fan of rays\nemanating from the origin. The situation is analogous to a diffraction problem in\nwhich a ray in geometrical optics strikes a point of nonanalyticity of a scatterer.\nA fan of diffracted rays is generated, and the amplitude along each ray can only\nbe determined by solving an inner diffraction problem. The inner problem is the\ndiffraction problem to determine our ray amplitude function B. Note though that by\nmatching (5.23) and (5.24) we can determine that \u03b3 must be constant and therefore\n\u03b3 \u2261 \u22121\/2.\n(c) Second-generation singularity\nLet us now try and apply the factorial\/power ansatz to equation (4.27) to de-\ntermine the late terms of the remainder R2.\nSince we expect the series to diverge in the form of factorial\/power, following\nChapman et al. (1998) we propose the ansatz\nA(n) \u223c B(\u03c3, \u03c4)\u0393(n+ \u03b3)\nv(\u03c3, \u03c4)n+\u03b3\n, (5.32)\nas n\u2192\u221e, where v, B and \u03b3 may be functions of \u03c3 and \u03c4 , but are independent of\nn. Substituting (5.32) into (4.27) we find that at leading-order in n\nv\u03c4 +\n\u03c3\n\u03c4\nv\u03c3 = (v\u03c3)\n3 + i\n\u221a\n3\u03c3\n\u03c4\n(v\u03c3)\n2. (5.33)\nThe divergence of the series is due to the singularity of A(0) at \u03c3 = 3\u03c4 , what we\nshall refer to as the second-generation singularity. We note that this is a singularity\nin the late terms only and not in the terms \u03c6(n) for n = O(1).\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nExponential asymptotics in a partial differential equation 33\nThe boundary condition on (5.33) is therefore v = 0 on \u03c3 = 3\u03c4 . In principle we\ncan solve (5.33) by Charpit\u2019s method. However, a scaling analysis shows that (5.33)\nhas solutions of the form\nv = \u03c4f(\u03b7) where \u03b7 =\n\u03c3\n\u03c4\n,\nand since the boundary condition is applied at \u03b7 = 3 our solution will be of this\nform. We find that f satisfies\nf = (f \u2032)3 + i\n\u221a\n3\u03b7 (f \u2032)2,\nf(3) = 0,\nwith solution\nf = i\n(\n\u03b7 \u2212 1\u2212\n(\n4\u03b73\n27\n)1\/2)\n,\ngiving\nv = i\n(\n\u2212\n\u221a\n4\u03c33\n27\u03c4\n+ \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c4\n)\n. (5.34)\nThis is just the difference of the two singulants, (5.8) and (5.20), as we know it\nmust be in order for our Stokes structure to be consistent. At the next order in n\nwe find\n\u03b3\u03c4 + 3\u03b3\u03c3 = 0, (5.35)\nso \u03b3 = \u03b3(\u03c3 \u2212 3\u03c4). At the next order in n, after much cancellation, the equation for\nB is\nB\u03c4 + 3B\u03c3 = 0. (5.36)\nThus B = B(\u03c3 \u2212 3\u03c4), and\nA(n) \u223c \u0393(n+ \u03b3)B(\u03c3 \u2212 3\u03c4)\nvn+\u03b3\n. (5.37)\nNow on the face of it we cannot determine B, even from matching with an inner\nregion in the vicinity of the singularity. This is because the singularity is at \u03c3 = 3\u03c4 ,\nso that we can only determine B(0) from such an analysis. However, from (4.28)\nwe find that\n\u0393(n+ \u03b3(z))B(z) \u223c fn(\u03b7)f(\u03b7)n+\u03b3(z)\n(\nz\n\u03b7 \u2212 3\n)\u03b3(z)\u22121\/2\n, (5.38)\nwhere z = \u03c3 \u2212 3\u03c4 .

Conclusions\nWe have begun to develop a methodology for calculating exponentially small terms\nbeyond all orders in the asymptotic expansions of the solutions to partial differential\nequations.We used an example motivated by the geometric model for crystal growth\nto demonstrate this methodology. The example was chosen to be linear so that the\nexact solution could be formulated in terms of an integral using a Fourier transform.\nIn Section 2 a steepest descent analysis of this integral was performed to identify\nvarious saddle point, end point and pole contributions to the approximation; and\nthe Stokes lines across which they are turned on or off. The existence of such a\nrepresentation of the solution provides a good check on the more direct methods of\nSections 3-5.\nIn Section 3 we found the full na\u00a8\u0131ve asymptotic expansion of the solution di-\nrectly from the equation. The Stokes lines and subdominant exponentials may be\nidentified by optimally truncating this expansion and smoothing the Stokes lines,\nas shown by Berry (1989) and by Chapman et al. (1998). However, in this case we\nfound that the nth term in the expansion was a sum of terms of the form facto-\nrial\/power, which needed to be approximated as n\u2192\u221e. Using a Watson transform\nto recast the sum as an integral and performing a steepest descents analysis, we\nfound that the approximation exhibited Stokes phenomenon, in that contributions\nto the approximation of the late terms may be switched on or off across what we\ntermed higher-order Stokes lines. Since the late terms in the series are responsible\nfor Stokes lines, such a higher-order Stokes line switches on and off Stokes lines\nthemselves.\nIn Section 4 we performed the Stokes smoothing and identified the Stokes lines\nand the exponentials they switch on. However, the picture was still not complete. We\nfound that one of the exponentials switched on across a Stokes line was in fact given\nby a divergent asymptotic expansion, which itself exhibited Stokes phenomenon.\nWe have called such a Stokes line a second-generation Stokes line. This second\ngeneration Stokes line is equivalent to the \u2018new\u2019 Stokes lines discussed by Berk\net al. (1982) and the \u2018vanishing\u2019 Stokes lines discussed by Aoki et al. (1998).\nFinally, in Section 5, we considered the possibility of identifying the late terms\ndirectly through a factorial\/power ansatz as n\u2192\u221e in the same way as Chapman\net al. (1998), since although in the example we considered we are able to find\nthe full asymptotic series of the solution exactly, this is unlikely to be the case in\ngeneral. The factorial\/power ansatz leads to an eikonal equation for the \u201cphase\u201d and\na transport equation for the premultiplying amplitude, with boundary conditions\ngiven by the position of the singularities in the leading-order problem. For some\nsingularities these equations were easy to solve, but for some the boundary data\nturned out to be given along a characteristic of the eikonal. Such singularities\nproduce eikonal solutions which are a fan of rays. This situation is analogous to the\nGeometrical Theory of Diffraction (see Keller (1958, 1962)), in which a ray striking\na point of nonanalyticity in a boundary generates a cone of diffracted rays. The\namplitude along these rays can only be determined by solving a canonical inner\ndiffraction problem. Exactly the same happens in the present situation; we have a\ncanonical inner problem to solve for our premultiplying amplitude.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the referees for their very helpful and thorough\nreports, and in particular for the suggestion to include a discussion of the Borel plane.\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n36 S.
