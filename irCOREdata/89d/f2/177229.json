In order to improve statistical power in\nsuch studies it is desirable to pool scanning resources from multiple centres. The CaliBrain project\nwas designed to provide for an assessment of scanner differences at three centres in Scotland, and\nto assess the practicality of pooling scans from multiple-centres.\nMethods: We scanned healthy subjects twice on each of the 3 scanners in the CaliBrain project\nwith T1-weighted sequences. The tissue classifier supplied within the Statistical Parametric Mapping\n(SPM5) application was used to map the grey and white tissue for each scan. We were thus able to\nassess within scanner variability and between scanner differences. We have sought to correct for\nbetween scanner differences by adjusting the probability mappings of tissue occupancy (tissue\npriors) used in SPM5 for tissue classification. The adjustment procedure resulted in separate sets\nof tissue priors being developed for each scanner and we refer to these as scanner specific priors.\nResults: Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) analyses and metric tests indicated that the use of\nscanner specific priors reduced tissue classification differences between scanners.

This can facilitate improvements in the\nstatistical power of quantitative brain imaging studies.\nBackground\nStructural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) of the\nbrain is employed in the assessment of a wide range of\nneuropsychiatric disorders. Voxel Based Morphometry\n(VBM) has been established as a leading method for ana-\nlysing large sMRI studies. VBM is a fully automated proc-\ness that is used to localise differences in brain parenchyma\n[1,2]. The VBM implementation segments T1-weighted\nMRI scans into voxel-wise mappings of grey and white tis-\nsue and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). It provides for statisti-\ncal comparisons of these mappings within clinical studies.\nVBM requires good quality co-registration at the voxel\nlevel and it is sensitive to differences between MRI scan-\nners. Reports of VBM analyses that pool scans from differ-\nent sites for analysis have employed validity assessments\n[3,4]. In a validity assessment, a VBM contrast of control\nsubjects between the contributing sites is used to map the\nregions of significant difference between scanners. A\nmasking image that charts these regions is formed. These\nmasked regions are excluded from VBM reporting as\nresults in these regions could be driven by artifactual scan-\nner differences [5,6].\nIn VBM the use of validity masking is undesirable because\nit limits the analyses to less than whole brain coverage. As\nVBM draws its inferences from voxel-wise comparisons it\nis necessary to apply fine grain corrections of the sMRI tis-\nsue classification in order to avoid validity masking. We\ninvestigated making such corrections by scanning the\nsame fourteen healthy subjects, twice, at three scanning\nsites in Scotland with T1-weighted sequences. These acqui-\nsitions were implemented as part of the CaliBrain study,\nand we have complete sets of scans for thirteen subjects.\nThe three scanners in the CaliBrain project were matched\non the basis of vendor, field strength and head coil type.\nIn this investigation we used an established sMRI analysis\ntool Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM5) [1] to seg-\nment the T1 scans into grey and white tissue maps and\nCSF maps.\nBaseline analyses of the Calibrain T1 segmentations\nrevealed significant differences between the scanners and\nthese differences were of an order that would require\nvalidity masking. We investigated the practicality of com-\npensating for scanner differences through the adjustments\nin the SPM5 segmentation procedure. The SPM segmenta-\ntion protocol employs spatial priors that map the proba-\nble distributions of grey and white tissue and CSF. These\npriors account for the low frequency variability in tissue\npresentation across the brain. We adjusted these prior\nmappings to compensate for the scanner differences. In\nthis process we developed separate sets of priors for each\nscanner. As above, we refer to these as scanner specific pri-\nors. In VBM analyses of the segmentations based upon\nscanner specific priors, we found that the baseline differ-\nences which had indicated a requirement for validity\nmasking were removed.\nIn addition to VBM analyses we applied metric tests to\nquantify within scanner variability and between scanner\ndifferences. These metrics were applied at baseline and on\nthe adjusted segmentations. The metric results demon-\nstrated that the use scanner specific priors can reduce the\ntissue classification differences between scanners. How-\never, these reductions were not sufficient to bring the\nbetween scanner differences down to the level of within\nscanner variability.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nThe CaliBrain project was designed to allow for the assess-\nment of differences between scanners and for these differ-\nences to be considered in the context of within scanner\nvariability. For this, healthy subjects travelled twice to\neach of the three scanning centres within a six months\nperiod. At each visit the subjects received a T1-weighted\nstructural MRI scan. We used SPM5 [1] to segment the\nstructural scans into baseline grey and white tissue maps\nand CSF maps. The SPM priors used in these baseline tis-\nsue classifications were taken from a study of psychosis\nwhich employed a scan sequence that was equivalent to\nthat used for the CaliBrain acquisitions [7]. The priors in\nthe psychosis study were drawn from scans of young\nadults with a family history of schizophrenia and control\nsubjects with no family history of psychosis. All 93 sub-\njects in this study were well at time of scanning.\nThe practice of adjusting the SPM tissue priors specifically\nfor a cohort acquired at one scanning centre is well estab-\nlished [8-12] and the importance of matching the spatial\npriors to the investigated population was demonstrated in\na study of healthy young adults [13]. We have extended\nthe practice of adjusting the SPM priors adjustment so that\nthey provide compensation for scanner differences. ToPage 2 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Imaging 2009, 9:8 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2342\/9\/8achieve scanner level compensation we implemented an\niterative adjustment protocol that employed proportional\nfeedback to develop scanner specific priors for each scan-\nner. We illustrate the operation of this protocol by ran-\ndomly selecting six subjects from the CaliBrain project.\nWe used the 1st round scans of these subjects to develop\nthe scanner specific priors. These priors were then used to\nsegment all the CaliBrain T1 scans and this gave the seg-\nmentations for our adjusted analyses. VBM contrast anal-\nyses and metrics were used to assess the scanner\ndifferences at baseline and for adjusted segmentations.\nThe seven subjects that were excluded from the scanner\nspecific process formed a test group upon which we could\nassess the viability of our protocol.\nData Acquisition\nThe CaliBrain project acquired MRI brain scans from three\nimaging research centres: The Department of Radiology,\nUniversity of Aberdeen; The Division of Psychiatry and\nThe SFC Brain Imaging Research Centre within The Centre\nfor Clinical Brain Sciences (CCBS) at The University of\nEdinburgh; and The Department of Clinical Physics, NHS\nGreater Glasgow South University Hospitals Division. The\nthree scanners used were manufactured by General Elec-\ntric (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) and had pri-\nmary field strengths of 1.5T. The scanners are nominated\nwithin this report as scanners 'A, B and C'.\nFourteen healthy participants (10 male, mean age 36.3,\nage range 22\u201351 years) took part in the study. All partici-\npants were native English speakers, right-handed (self\nreported), met the standard MRI safety criteria and had no\nhistory of diagnosed neurological disorder, major psychi-\natric disorder or treatment with psychotropic medication,\nincluding treatment for substance misuse. The partici-\npants were not paid, but they were reimbursed for\nexpenses. All participants provided written informed con-\nsent and the study was approved by the local research eth-\nics committees. The scan records were incomplete for one\nsubject and thus the harmonisation methods in the Cali-\nBrain project were conducted on the basis of 13 healthy\nparticipants.\nThree General Electric 1.5T scanners were used in this\nstudy, with some inevitable differences in hardware and\nsoftware versions. In site A scanning was conducted with\na General Electrics (GE) 1.5T Signa NVi\/CVi scanner (soft-\nware version 9.1; gradients with max. amplitude 40 mT\/m\nand max. slew rate 150 T\/m\/s; standard quadrature head\ncoil). In site B scanning was conducted with a General\nElectrics (GE) 1.5T Signa LX scanner (software version\n9.1M4; Echo-speed gradients with max. amplitude 22 mT\/\nm and max. slew rate 120 T\/m\/s; standard quadrature\nhead coil). In site C scanning was conducted with a Gen-\neral Electrics (GE) 1.5T Signa scanner (software version\n11M3\/11M4SP1; gradients with max. amplitude 40 mT\/\nm and max. slew rate 150 T\/m\/s; standard quadrature\nhead coil).\nAll subjects participated in six scanning sessions, two at\neach of the three sites. The time lapse between scans at\neach site was nominally two weeks. The scanning param-\neters were kept constant across the three scanners, allow-\ning for minor deviations arising from differences in\nscanner hardware and software. A high resolution T1-\nweighted scan was acquired using a 3D inversion recov-\nery-prepared fast gradient echo volume sequence with the\nfollowing parameters: orientation coronal; repetition\ntime (TR) of 5.9 ms (sites A and C) or 8.2 ms (site B); echo\ntime (TE) of 1.9 ms (site A) or 3.3 ms (site B) or 1.4 ms\n(site C); slice thickness = 1.7 mm without a gap; inversion\ntime (TI) 600 ms; matrix = 256 \u00d7 256, voxel within slice\ndimension = 0.86 mm square; field of view (FOV) = 220\nmm2; flip angle = 15\u00b0; 128 slices.\nVBM Preprocessing and Segmentation\nPrior to SPM5 segmentation, co-registration and reslicing\nprocedures were applied to ensure that all the scans were\naligned to the anterior-posterior commissure axis (AC-\nPC) in the standard MNI template space. As part of this\nprocess the scans were re-sampled to a resolution of 1 \u00d7 1\n\u00d7 1 mm. The SPM5 segmentation at baseline was imple-\nmented using a study specific priors set that had been pre-\nviously developed for a study of psychosis [7]. The SPM5\nadjusted segmentations were obtained using the scanner\nspecific priors derived in our priors adjustment procedure.\nThe SPM5 segmentations were run using the default set-\ntings, the 'Number of Gaussians per class' was set to [2 2\n2] and the 'Bias regularization' was set to 'medium'. In\nkeeping with the established practice in psychosis research\nthe segmented results were output as unmodulated and\nnormalized to the MNI template. The normalization\nemployed the SPM5 default normalization with the 'Non-\nlinear Frequency Cutoff = 25'. Also, in keeping with estab-\nlished VBM practice for psychosis in tissue density\nanalyses the SPM5 segmentations were smoothed using\nan isotropic 12 mm Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM)\nkernel.\nProcedure for creating Scanner Specific Priors\nOur iterative procedure that compensates for scanner dif-\nferences employs proportional feedback to develop sets of\nscanner specific priors for use in the adjusted SPM5 seg-\nmentations. The process flow diagram in Figure 1 gives an\noverview of this procedure. We designate one scanner as\nthe target scanner and a second as the object scanner. The\nscans from the target scanner are segmented using SPM5\nand for this segmentation the priors were taken from our\npsychosis study [7]. The priors applied to the target scan-\nner remain unchanged throughout the run of the iterativePage 3 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Imaging 2009, 9:8 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2342\/9\/8procedure. The object scanner segmentation is also initial-\nised with the priors taken from our psychosis study [7].\nThen through our iterative procedure these object scanner\npriors are incrementally adjusted. These adjustments are\nset to compensate for the segmentation differences\nbetween the target and object scanners.\nThe process illustrated in Figure 1 adjusts the object priors\nthrough comparisons based upon grey and white segmen-\ntations. This dual dependence of the adjusted priors on\ngrey and white tissue is accommodated by allowing the\niteration process to alternate the prime comparison\nbetween the grey and white tissue types. Thus for every\nother iteration the prime tissue comparison is applied to\nthe grey segment and this is interspersed with the prime\ntissue comparison being made on the white segment.\nWhen grey is the prime comparison segment we adjust the\ngrey prior to correct for the voxel level differences found\nbetween the target and object scanners and also at the\nvoxel level we apply a balancing adjustment to the white\nor CSF prior to ensure that the sum of the priors at the\nvoxel level is maintained at its nominal sum of unity. Sim-\nilarly when the prime comparison is made upon the white\nsegment we adjust the white prior to correct for the differ-\nences between the target and object scanner and we apply\na balancing adjustment to the grey or CSF prior. In VBM\nassessments of psychosis CSF presentation is not an estab-\nlished measure of interest, thus we do not assign CSF the\nprime status within the priors adjustment process.\nOn a subject by subject basis the prime comparison seg-\nmentations obtained from the target and object scanners\nare subtracted. These subtractions were implemented at\nthe voxel-level and the differences were averaged across\nthe subjects included in the priors adjustment process.\nThe averaged voxel-level differences were used to form a\ndifference image that was then smoothed to suppress sam-\npling noise and reduce subject bias. Next a proportion of\nthe smoothed difference image is used to adjust the grey,\nwhite and CSF priors applied to the object scanner. These\nadjusted priors are then made available for the next itera-\nProcess Flow diagramFigure 1\nProcess Flow diagram.

Adjustment of the object scanner priors is used to minimise the difference \nbetween the scanners. The final adjusted object scanner priors are output as the scanner specific priors.Page 4 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Imaging 2009, 9:8 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2342\/9\/8tion of the procedure. This process is repeated until the\nsegmentations given by the object scanner converge with\nthose given by the target scanner. We assess this conver-\ngence through the use of metrics described below.\nThe evaluation of the prime difference image Pgdiff for the\ngrey segment G is given in equation (1). When the prime\ncomparison segment is white W, the difference image\nPwdiff is given by equation (2). In these calculations of the\nprime difference images, the processed scans are desig-\nnated by subscripts (subject, visit, scanner), with N = 6, the\nnumber of compared subjects. These comparisons were\nlimited to the 1st round scans. The averaging across the\nadjustment subjects suppresses individual differences.\nWhen the primary segment is grey the adjusted prior adjG-\nprior is given by equation (3). In this voxel-level process\nthe current grey prior curGprior has a proportion beta of\nthe smoothed prime difference sPgdiff image subtracted.\nWhen the prime comparison segment is grey the evalua-\ntions of the adjusted white adjWprior and CSF priors\nadjCprior are given by equations (4) and (5). In these the\nchanges applied to the grey prior are balanced by equiva-\nlent additions to the white or CSF priors. At the voxel level\nwe test the relative occupancy of the white and CSF priors\nand assign the balancing adjustment to which ever prior\nexhibits greater occupancy. When the prime comparison\nsegment is white the adjusted priors evaluations are equiv-\nalent to those given in equations (3), (4) and (5) with the\nexceptions that the prime difference image is given by\nPwdiff and the grey and white priors are interchanged. This\naveraged difference images Pgdiff and Pwdiff are smoothed\nusing an isotropic kernel, with a FWHM of 10 mm.\nSmoothing at this level suppresses sampling noise and\nlimits the subject bias that results from the relatively small\nnumber of subjects that we have used to create the scanner\nspecific priors\nThe value of beta determines the proportion of the differ-\nence image that is used to adjust the priors for the follow-\ning iteration of the protocol. The setting of beta has an\nimportant bearing on this protocol. A high setting for beta\ncould lead to instability whilst using value that is too low\ncould result in sluggish convergence. As part of the devel-\nopment of this method, we experimented with the beta\nsetting and found that setting beta to 0.33 or greater could\nlead to instability in the priors adjustment process. We\nfound that a beta setting of 0.15 allowed for stable conver-\ngence of the segmentations from different scanners. We\nfound that further reductions of the beta value did not\nimprove the degree of convergence that was obtained\nfrom the adjustment process. The reductions in beta did\nincrease the number iterations required to attain conver-\ngence. We ran a between scanner distance metric to assess\nthe degree of convergence between the target and object\nscanners. We terminated the adjustment procedure when\nthe incremental change in the between scanner distance\nwas less than 0.1% and held at this level in subsequent\niterations.\nTesting Scanner Specific Priors Procedure\nWe tested our priors adjustment procedure by randomly\nselecting six subjects from the CaliBrain project. We\napplied the scanner specific priors adjustment to the 1st\nround scans of these subjects. We designated the scanners\nin the CaliBrain project as scanners A, B and C. Scanner A\nwas set as the target scanner and scanner B as the object\nscanner and we developed a set of scanner specific priors\nfor scanner B. We also developed scanner specific priors\nfor scanner C with scanner A set as the target scanner.\nThroughout these adjustment procedures the priors set\nused for scanner A was fixed as the priors drawn from our\nstudy of psychosis [7]. The scanner specific priors devel-\noped for scanners B and C were initialised with the priors\nfrom our psychosis study. The choice of scanner A for as\nthe target scanner was based upon the baseline metric\nresults that indicated that scanner A has a low within scan-\nner variability and that it exhibited the lowest overall\nbetween scanner differences.\nVBM Statistical Analysis\nUsing the SPM5 application we implemented VBM statis-\ntical analyses of the grey and white segmentations at base-\nline and for our adjusted segmentations. In these we\ntreated the visits and scanners as separate grouping com-\nponents and thus formed a factorial analysis matrix that\nwas composed of six groups. We designated the Independ-\nence variable as 'NO' to account for the fact that we have\nrepeated measures on the same subjects. We reported the\noverall F-test for main effect of scanner in the CaliBrain\nPgdiff\nN\nG Gn, Obje ct n, T et\nn=\nN\n=\n1\nvisit, . visit, arg\n1\n( )( ) ( )\u2212\u2211 (1)\nPwdiff\nN\nW Wn, Obje ct n, T et\nn=\nN\n=\n1\nvisit, . visit, arg\n1\n( )( ) ( )\u2212\u2211\n(2)\nadjGprior curGprior sPgdiff beta= \u2212 \u2217 (3)\nadjWprior curWprior sPgdiff beta if curWprior curCprior= + \u2217 >( ) ( )\n0 if curCprior curWprior( )>=\n\u23a7\u23a8\u23a9\n\u23ab\u23ac\u23ad\n(4)\nadjCprior curCprior sPgdiff beta if curCprio curWprior= + \u2217 >=( ) ( )\n0 if curWprio curCprior( )>\n\u23a7\u23a8\u23a9\n\u23ab\u23ac\u23ad\n(5)Page 5 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Imaging 2009, 9:8 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2342\/9\/8study. Also, we used this design matrix to report t-test con-\ntrast results for within scanner variability and between\nscanner differences. The t-tests for between scanner differ-\nences were made by combining the two visits at each scan-\nner. All t-tests and the F-test were carried out with an\nuncorrected threshold of 0.001, and we reported Family\nwise error (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons. All\ngroups were composed of the same subjects and as the\nscans were all acquired within a six month period there\nwas no requirement to covary for age or gender.\nVoxel-wise distance metrics\nWe employed a percentage distance metric to quantify the\nwithin scanner variability and between scanner differ-\nences. In SPM, tissue occupancy is assigned at the voxel\nlevel for grey, white and CSF as full occupancy or as partial\nvolumes. At full occupancy the voxel is assigned as either\ngrey or white or CSF with occupancy of 1.0. At the inter-\nface between tissue types partial occupancy is assigned on\na continuous scale from 0.0 to 1.0 and the sum of the\nassigned occupancy for each voxel does not exceed 1.0.\nIn order to evaluate the distance between two tissue clas-\nsifications we computed as a percentage the absolute dis-\ntance. The general form of the absolute percentage\ndistance computation is illustrated in equation (6) where\nwe compare two voxels V1 and V2. This reports the per-\ncentage absolute difference with respect to the average\nvalue of the compared voxels. We chose this metric\nbecause it accentuates the differences in the compared seg-\nmentations.\nIn keeping with established VBM analyses the metrics\nwere applied to the smoothed segmentations and limited\nto valid-voxels where the compared segments had occu-\npancy of greater than 0.05. The summary value reported\nby the metric is an average of the absolute percentage dif-\nference found at the valid voxels in the normalised and\nsmoothed segmentations. The metrics are applied on a\nsubject basis and for each subject we evaluate the within\nscanner variability for scanners A, B and C and we evaluate\nthe between scanner differences for the scanner pairs AB,\nAC and BC. A paired sample t-test is used to compare the\nbaseline and adjusted metric results and to report the\nmean difference and its significance.\nResults\nMetric Results\nWe applied the percentage distance metric to the grey mat-\nter segmentations to obtain measures of within scanner\nvariability and between scanner differences. The metric\nwas applied at baseline and after adjustment using the\nscanner specific priors. Table 1 gives the grey matter metric\nresults averaged across the six subjects used to generate the\nscanner specific priors. Table 2 gives the grey matter metric\nresults averaged across the seven subjects who were\nexcluded from the process that developed the scanner spe-\ncific priors. In Tables 1 and 2 we note the mean difference\nbetween baseline and adjusted analyses and we give the\np_value for the paired sample t-test as measure of signifi-\ncance in the adjustment process.\nVBM Analyses\nWe ran VBM baseline and adjusted analyses on the nor-\nmalised and smoothed segmentations obtained for the\nseven subjects who were excluded from the prior's adjust-\nment procedure. In these analyses we treat the visits and\nscanners as separate grouping components and thus form\na design matrix composed of six groups. We applied an F-\ntest to consider the main effect of scanner and t-tests to\ninvestigate within and between scanner differences. All\ngroups are composed of the same seven subjects and as\nthe scans were all conducted within a six month period\nthere is no requirement to co-vary for age or gender.\nBaseline VBM Results\nThe F-test main effect Maximum Intensity Projection\n(MIP) for the baseline grey matter analysis is illustrated in\nFigure 2.

Our aim\nwas to refine the application of SPM segmentation proc-\nesses and reduce the effects of scanner differences which\ncurrently limit multi-centre MRI pooling [3,4]. We have\nexamined the application of the SPM5 priors based seg-\nmentation to scans sourced from three scanners. The scan-\nners were matched by vendor, primary field strength, and\nhead coil type, and equivalent sequences were used at\neach scanner. Although these scanners are well matched\nwe found in our baseline analyses significant between\nscanner differences in the tissue segmentations. We have\ndemonstrated that if we employ scanner specific priors in\nour application of SPM that these between scanner differ-\nences are reduced.\nIn VBM analyses the harmonisation constraints for the use\nof multiple scanners are onerous as VBM requires the pro-\nGrey Matter Baseline ResultsFigure 2\nGrey Matter Baseline Results.

Previous work has shown that it is possible to pool\nscans from multiple centres in parcellated volumetric\nstudies. In a volumetric analysis of images from multiple\nscanners [14], their semi-automated method applied glo-\nbal corrections for the tissue classification which were\ncomputed separately for each scanner. The methods\nreported summary volumes for grey and white matter in\nthe cerebrum, and cerebellum and lateral ventricle vol-\numes [15]. This set-level segmentation method employed\nglobal estimates of the intensity values that marked the\ntransitions between tissue types and CSF. These globally\napplied transitions were adjusted for each scanning site.\nA methodology that seeks to minimise the differences\nbetween scanners through an integration of scan sequence\nparameters into the segmentation functions was proposed\nby [16] and gives global adjustment in the intensity to tis-\nsue mapping. These global corrections are appropriate in\nstudies where the inferences drawn are limited to lobar tis-\nsue occupancy. A volumetric method that addresses the\nlocalised intensity to tissue mappings has been proposed\nby [17] and recognises that localised adjustments for the\nintensity to tissue mapping within the brain are necessary\nfor scan pooling to be valid for parcellation studies. The\nmethod that we have proposed is in keeping with this\nexisting work as we have implemented corrections at a\nscale that is close to the analysis scale for VBM.\nResearch for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initi-\native (ADNI) project demonstrated that to pool scans\nfrom multiple sites, it is important to minimise differ-\nences between pooled scanners [18-20]. The ADNI project\nis a longitudinal analysis of ageing and in this within site\nMRI reproducibility was tested on a range of scanners and\nsequences. Based upon this research an MR-RAGE\nsequence was recommended for multiple site scanning\nand a scheme of corrections that includes field mapping\nand geometry correction is applied. ADNI researchers\ninvestigated the use of B1 field mapping to correct for\nwithin scanner variation in the RF inhomogenity for\nphased array head coils [20]. The results indicated that\nthis technique has limitations. However, B1 field map-\nping can be applied as an addition to the priors adjust-\nments protocol that we have developed. It is possible that\nthe inclusion of field mapping would further reduce the\nbetween scanner differences in the CaliBrain project.\nHowever, the scan time acquisitions necessary for correc-\ntion of the B1 field are not available in the CaliBrain\nproject.\nRecent reports of VBM analyses that sourced scans from\nmultiple scanners employed validation masks to limit the\nreporting of results to regions where the scanner segmen-\ntations were equivalent [3,4]. Meda [4] demonstrated in a\nVBM study of psychosis at four centres that is possible to\nlimit the effects of scanner differences by validity masking\nand ensuring that in the pooled analysis that the subjects\nand controls are drawn equally from all contributing cen-\ntres [4]. A VBM analysis of scans taken from six scanners\n[3] reported that through the use of equivalent scan\nsequences and good quality control, the extent of valida-\ntion masking required could be limited to a single region\nin the thalamus.\nIn the CaliBrain project we consider within scanner varia-\nbility and between scanner differences and our aim was to\nreduce the between scanner differences to the level of\nwithin scanner variability. In keeping with the ADNI rec-\nommendations we have sought to minimise the scanner\ndifferences in terms of vendor, field strength, head coil\nand sequences. However, scanner B in the CaliBrain\nproject does differ from scanners A and C in terms of max-\nimum gradient amplitude and maximum slew rate. Our\nbaseline results indicate that scanners A and C are well\nmatched and scans from these two sites could be pooled\nwithout further adjustment or compensation. However,\nour baseline results also demonstrate that scanner B\nexhibits significant differences with respect to both scan-\nners A and C.\nIn order to reduce the differences between the scanners in\nthe CaliBrain project we have developed a procedure that\nemploys proportional feedback to adjust the priors for\neach of the scanners. We have scan records for 13 healthy\nsubjects who were scanned twice at three scanners within\na six month period. We demonstrate our protocol for cre-\nating scanner specific priors using the 1st round scans of\nsix subjects. We test the adequacy of these scanner specific\npriors through metric and VBM analyses. The tests for ade-\nquacy are applied to the seven subjects who were excluded\nfrom the priors adjustment protocol. These tests are lim-\nited by the number of subject scans available and we are\nunable to evaluate the full effects of subject variation\nexpected in a multi-centre clinical study.\nClinical studies that could benefit from the scanner spe-\ncific priors method are expected to have subject numbers\nconsiderably greater than those available for the CaliBrain\nproject. In a multi-centre clinical study, with the exception\nof the travelling subjects used to develop the scanner spe-\ncific priors, the subjects would be recruited and scanned\nindependently at the contributing centres. In such a clini-\ncal study a test for adequacy of scanner harmonisation\ncould be implemented through comparisons of the\nhealthy control scans recruited from the contributing cen-\ntres [3,4].\nThe metric that we report assesses the absolute distance\nbetween segmentations. The metrics are applied at thePage 10 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Imaging 2009, 9:8 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2342\/9\/8voxel level and are averaged to report an overall distance\ninclusive of noise and systematic differences. We report in\nTable 1 on the scans that were used to implement the\nscanner specific priors procedure. This indicates that the\nwithin scanner variability ranges from 3.0% in scanner B\nto 2.1% in scanners A and C. The adjustment process gives\nrise to a reduction in the within scanner variability. How-\never, the paired-t tests reveal that these within scanner\nadjustments do not represent a significant change. In\nTable 1 the baseline between scanner differences are at a\nmaximum for the BC comparison. Here the adjustment\nprocedure gave rise to significant reductions in all three\nscanner comparison metrics.\nIn Table 2 we consider the effects of the scanner specific\npriors on the scans of seven subjects who were excluded\nfrom the priors adjustment process. At baseline the within\nscanner variability and between scanner distances were\nequivalent to the baseline results reported in Table 1.\nConsequently, the use of the scanner specific priors\nresulted in significant reductions in all three scanner com-\nparisons. However, for the comparisons that include scan-\nner B, the reductions are not sufficient to bring the\nbetween scanner difference down to the level of within\nscanner variability.\nThe VBM analyses that we applied demonstrated that at\nbaseline there are no significant differences between scan-\nners A and C, However, we found that comparisons of\nscanners A and C with scanner B gave rise to differences\nthat would require validity mapping such as that\nemployed in VBM analyses by [3,4]. After developing\nscanner specific priors for scanners B and C and re-seg-\nmenting the scans we found that the requirement for\nvalidity mapping was removed, because we recorded no\nsignificant differences in the grey and white matter F-tests\nfor scanner effect.\nConclusion\nOur results indicate the development of scanner specific\npriors for the SPM application can assist in the pooling of\nscan resources from different research centres. This devel-\nopment can facilitate scan pooling and allow for improve-\nments in the statistical power of multi-centre brain\nimaging studies. Our results indicate that six subjects were\nadequate for the purpose of matching the scanners in the\nCaliBrain project. In the typical clinical study the range of\ntissue presentations would be expected to be greater than\nthat seen in our study of healthy controls. Thus it is likely\nthat in a clinical study that more than six travelling sub-\njects would be required. The number of travelling subjects\nrequired would depend upon the diversity of tissue pres-\nentation in the study and upon the nature of the differ-\nences in the scanners pooled. The method that we have\nsuggested may be limited to multi-site studies in which\nthere are no major hardware and acquisition protocol dif-\nferences across sites. The CaliBrain project uses scanners\nfrom the same vendor all with the same field strengths\nand head coils with matched sequences. This provides an\noptimal environment for multiple site scan pooling. Dif-\nferent field strengths and image acquisition protocols\ncould have very different tissue contrasts that would lead\nto marked differences in segmentation results. In such\ncases the differences in tissue classification may well be\nbeyond the scope of our compensatory method.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nTWJM developed the scanner correction procedure,\nplayed a leading role in the design of CaliBrain study and\nis the principal author of the manuscript; VEG is the main\nworking researcher on the CaliBrain project, they devel-\noped the links with the three contributing scanning cen-\ntres, established the CaliBrain scanning protocols and\ncontributed to the manuscript; DEJ played a major role in\nthe design of the CaliBrain project, assisted in the devel-\nopment of the scanning protocols at the three centres, and\ncontributed to the final text; AMM assisted in the design\nof the clinical objects of the CaliBrain project and assisted\nin the preparation of the manuscript.
