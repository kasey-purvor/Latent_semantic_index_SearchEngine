The operating potential was +150 mV. A strong correlation between\nthe biosensor response and untreated onion juice of known pyruvate concentration 2 \u2013 12\n\uf06dmol\/g fresh weight (FW) was demonstrated. The biosensor was able to differentiate\nbetween low and high pungency onions. The detection limit using 1 unit of pyruvate\noxidase was 1 \u2013 2 \uf06dmol\/g FW. Optimum concentrations of co-factors TPP and FAD and\nMgSO4 comprising the enzyme cocktail were determined as being 0.04 mM, 0.1 mM and\n30 mM, respectively.\nKeywords: meldolas blue; fresh produce; quality assurance; sweet onions\n1. Introduction\nBulb onions are the second most important horticultural crop after tomatoes (Griffiths\net al. 2002) and are consumed worldwide for their unique flavour. Increasingly, low\npungency bulbs (often referred to colloquially as mild and\/or sweet onions) are consumed\nraw in the USA and elsewhere. Pyruvate concentration (\uf06dmol\/g FW) in macerated onion\n2tissue is used as a quality assurance indicator of pungency (Schwimmer and Weston,\n1961; Wall and Corgan, 1992; Crowther et al., 2005) or flavour intensity in most onion\nproducing countries. Typically, low pungency onions have a pyruvate concentration of\nca. <5 \uf06dmol\/g FW and command a price premium.\nDespite improvements to the original Schwimmer and Weston (1961) method over\nthe last four decades, current quality assurance assays for onion pungency (e.g. Randle\nand Bussard, 1993; Yoo and Pike, 2001) are still relatively time-consuming and\nexpensive. Confidence in the accuracy of pyruvate measurements is becoming more\nimportant, particularly as the popularity of low pungency onions increases (Yoo and Pike,\n2001; Havey et al., 2002). Pungency tests are currently out-sourced. Decentralising the\ncurrent pyruvate assay will empower growers and packers marketing low pungency\nonions to improve their quality assurance procedures.\nThe demand for reliable and inexpensive methods for the assessment of fresh produce\nquality is set to expand; biosensors offer a viable opportunity to fulfil this niche (Terry et\nal., 2005). Over the last twenty years research has been carried out to produce a pyruvate\nbiosensor, mainly for clinical applications (Table 1). This present study describes the\ndevelopment of an amperometric biosensor to detect and quantify the pyruvate\nconcentration in juice from macerated onion tissue based on the following enzyme\nreaction:\npyruvate oxidase (PyOx)\nPyruvate + HPO4-2 + O2 \u2192 acetylphosphate + H2O2 + CO2\nMediators were used to reduce the effects of electrochemically active species, found in\nmany food matrices (Terry et al., 2005). Meldolas blue was the preferred mediator used\nfor this study; the reaction of which is as follows:\nPyruvate + HPO-24 + O2 \u2192 acetylphosphate + PyOx(FADH2) (1)\nPyOx(FADH2) + MB+ \u2192 PyOx(FAD) + MBH + 2H+ (2)\nMBH \u2192 MB+ + H+ + 2e- (3)\nINSERT TABLE 1\n32. Materials and methods\n2.1 Reagents, standards and plant material\nAll of the chemicals used were of analytical grade. Pyruvate oxidase (E.C. 1.2.3.3.;\nPyOx) derived from Pediococcus spp., thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), flavin adenine\ndinucleotide (FAD), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine (2, 4-\nDNPH); pyruvic acid sodium salt (C3H3O3Na), magnesium sulphate (MgSO4), sodium\nhydroxide (NaOH) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA); potassium chloride (KCl), disodium\nhydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4) and sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4) were\npurchased from Sigma (Dorset, UK); Fisher Scientific Chemicals (Dorset, UK), and\nBDH. Ltd. (Leics., UK), respectively. All reagents were made up in reverse osmosis\nwater. FAD and TPP co-factors were made up as 3 mM and 6 mM stock solutions,\nrespectively, and stored at -20\uf0b0C until use. MgSO4 was prepared as a 0.9 M stock\nsolution and stored at 4\uf0b0C. Pyruvate oxidase solution was made up in the co-factor mix.\nPyruvic acid sodium salt for deriving calibration standards was made up as a 5 mM stock\nsolution and stored at 4\uf0b0C.\nCommercially grown onion cvs. SupaSweet (SS1), Renate, Hyfort, Red Baron, UK\nSturon, Crystal, Marimba and Spanish Pandero bulbs were donated by F.B. Parrish and\nSon Ltd. (Beds., UK), Moulton Bulb Co. Ltd. (Lincs., UK), or Bedfordshire Growers Ltd.\n(Beds., UK).\n2.2 Onion pyruvate analysis\nTotal pyruvate was measured according to Schwimmer and Weston (1961) and\nCrowther et al. (2005) with slight modifications. Whole onion bulbs were homogenised\nusing a domestic blender (Braun, Type 4192, Spain) (Yoo and Pike, 1999). The juice\nwas left to incubate for 1h at room temperature. Aliquots (1.5 ml) were transferred to\neppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 16060 g (rotor 3325) for 10 min (Biofuge Pico,\nKendro Laboratory Products, Germany). Some samples were subsequently stored at\n4-20\u02daC prior to analysis. Juices were thawed at room temperature for 30 min and diluted\n15-fold in deionised water. Filtrates (0.5 ml) were added to 1 ml aliquots of 0.0125%\n(v\/v) (2, 4-DNPH) in 2 M HCl and 1.5 ml deionised water in boiling tubes. The mixture\nwas briefly vortexed and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min. Five ml of 0.6 M NaOH was\nadded and the absorbance at 420 nm recorded (Camspec M501, Camspec Ltd., Cambs,\nUK). A standard curve to allow calculation of pyruvate concentrations from onion\nsamples was produced by taking 10 ml of 5 mM pyruvic acid stock solution and diluting\nto 1 mM, followed by serial dilutions giving a concentration range of standards of 0.04 to\n0.4 mM. Pyruvate concentrations (\u00b5mol\/g FW) in onion were determined from the\nequation of the straight line on the standard curve.\n2.3 Unmediated electrodes\nScreen printed disposable plain carbon electrodes were manufactured by Cranfield\nUniversity, Silsoe, UK. The electrodes comprised of a central carbon working electrode\n(10 mm2), a counter electrode and a Ag\/AgCl reference electrode. The electrodes were\nprinted using a DEK 247 screen-printer (DEK Printing Machines Ltd., Dorset, UK).\nSensors were connected to an Autolab workstation (Echochemi, Utrecht, The\nNetherlands) via custom made electrical connectors (RS Components, Northhants., UK).\nThe Autolab was controlled by the Autolab General Purpose Electrochemical System\n(GPES) software. Measurements were initially carried out at +800 mV at 21\uf0b0C. All\nexperiments were undertaken in triplicate. All electrodes were only used once before\ndisposal.\nInitially, the response of unmediated carbon electrodes without enzyme and cofactors\nto onion cv. Renate juice was examined. Reagents included 50 mM sodium phosphate\nbuffer pH 6.9 and cofactor mix A: 2 units PyOx, 0.2 mM TPP, 0.01 mM FAD and 10\nmM MgSO4 (final concentrations). The electrochemical response to increasing pyruvate\nconcentrations in previously frozen undiluted onion juice was also compared against a\ncalibration curve using the modified Schwimmer and Weston (1961) assay. All\nmeasurements were made by depositing 20 \u00b5l KCl electrolyte on the electrode surface,\n5applying the potential then allowing a steady state current to be reached before adding 20\n\u00b5l onion juice.\n2.4 Mediated electrodes\nGeneric carbon, mediated with meldolas blue (C2030519D5, Gwent Electronic\nMaterials Ltd. GEM, Gwent, UK) comprised the working electrodes (28 mm2) and were\nscreen printed with Ag\/AgCl reference\/counter electrodes onto a PVC substrate in a two\nelectrode configuration. Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a\nPalmSense potentiostat (Palm Instruments BV, The Netherlands). Electrochemical\nmeasurements were carried out at either +150 mV or +200 mV at 21\u00b0C.\nEnzyme immobilisation was achieved by depositing an enzyme cocktail containing\nPyOx, TPP, FAD and MgSO4 made up in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 5.7 onto the\nsurface of the working electrode. Electrodes were left to air dry for 4h, then subsequently\nstored at 4\u00b0C prior to use. The optimum pH for hydrogen peroxide liberation from the\nreaction of pyruvate oxidase and pyruvate in the presence of phosphate and oxygen is 5.7.\nIrrespective of pyruvate content (2.3 \u2013 6.6 \uf06dmol\/g FW), the pH of onion juices for cvs.\nRed Baron, SS1, Marimba, Crystal, UK Sturon and Spanish Pandero marketed in the\nU.K. corresponded with the optimum for PyOx activity.\nThe electrochemical response to undiluted juices from individual onion cvs. SS1 and\nRenate bulbs of increasing pyruvate concentration were examined in two separate\nexperiments using meldolas blue sensors.\n2.6 Interference\nThe effect of operating potential on interference in juices from different onion (cvs.\nRed Baron, Spanish Pandero and Hyfort) cultivars were compared at +150 mV and +200\nmV using cofactor mix B: 1 unit PyOx, 0.04 mM TPP, 0.1 mM FAD and 30 mM MgSO4\n(final concentrations).\n3. Results and discussion\n63.1 Response of unmediated carbon electrodes with and without PyOx and cofactors to\nonion juice\nThe electrochemical biosensor response to onion cv. Renate juice was considerably\namplified with the addition of enzyme and co-factors (data not shown). However, a\nsignificant response was also evident with the addition of juice on bare electrodes due to\nother electrochemically active species in onion inevitably being oxidised at +800 mV\n(data not shown). Nevertheless, these preliminary results demonstrated the feasibility of\nmeasuring pyruvate concentration in onion juice using an amperometric biosensor format,\nbut in order to reduce the biosensor operating potential, mediated sensors were adopted\nfor further biosensor development.\n3.2 Response of mediated meldolas blue electrodes to undiluted onion juice\nMeldolas blue biosensors responded positively to increasing pyruvate concentrations\nin onion juice at a significantly reduced potential of +200 mV compared with unmediated\nelectrodes at +800 mV. An operating potential of +200 mV was adopted following\npreliminary experiments where a constant operating range between +50 mV and +250\nmV was demonstrated (data not shown). Furthermore, the meldolas blue biosensor gave\nconsiderably enhanced signals compared with the standard carbon format. A good\ncorrelation between the mediated biosensor responses to known pyruvate within juices of\nonion cvs. SS1 (low pungency) and Renate (high pungency) was demonstrated (Figs. 1 &\n2).\nINSERT FIGURE 1\nINSERT FIGURE 2\n3.3 Interference Experiments\n7There was, with some cultivars, a significant response on bare compared with enzyme\nimmobilised mediated electrodes, indicating the presence of interference compounds.\nThere was also a clear variation in background current across and within onion cultivars\nat +150 mV and +200 mV. This background response was reduced at +150 mV without\nany deterioration in performance. Levels of interference were 4.7% \u00b1 1.8, 80.3% \u00b1 5.5\nand 32.0% \u00b1 4.4 at +150 mV and 31.0% \u00b1 3.8, 89.3% \u00b1 1.9, 42.7% \u00b1 8.1 at +200 mV for\ncvs. Red Baron, Spanish Pandero and Hyfort, respectively. The corresponding pyruvate\ncontents ranged between 4.3 \u2013 6.6, 7.7 \u2013 9.5 and 10 \u2013 10.7 \uf06dmol\/g FW for cvs. Red\nBaron, Spanish Pandero and Hyfort, respectively. These results suggested that major\npolyphenols in red-skinned onions (cv. Red Baron; Price et al., 1997), were unlikely to be\na major contributing factor given the low interference response.\n4. Conclusion\nMeldolas blue mediated electrodes were shown to be the best biosensor format tested\nfor the amperometric detection of pyruvate in the juice from macerated onion tissue.\nThere was a strong correlation between the biosensor response and known pyruvate\nconcentrations (2 \u2013 12 \uf06dmol\/g FW) in onion as measured using the modified Schwimmer\nand Weston (1961) colorimetric assay. No sample dilution was necessary as found with\nsome other pyruvate biosensors developed for clinical applications (cf. Table 1).\nThis preliminary study has demonstrated for the first time the possibility of replacing\nthe standard colorimetric assay used ubiquitously by the world onion industry for\ndetermining pyruvate concentration with a more rapid method using a mediated\namperometric biosensor. Introduction of a pyruvate biosensor for onions will empower\ngrowers to undertake their own quality control, rather than outsourcing pungency\nanalysis. Ongoing work aims to further improve biosensor performance and elucidate\npossible variations in cultivar interference.\nAcknowledgements\n8This work forms part of a larger HortLink project (HL0164LFV; Defining quality\nassurance for sweet onions with rapid biosensor analysis) and is financially supported by\nthe UK government (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; DEFRA) and\nUK industry representatives (Allium and Brassica Centre Ltd.
