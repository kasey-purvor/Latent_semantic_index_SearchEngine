Introduction \nA brief review is given of lifetime and line broadening studies with the free electron laser at FOM- \nRijnhuizen (FELIX), emphasising work on far infrared (FIR) modulated photoluminescence (PL) \nof bound-to-bound transitions in InAs\/GaAs quantum dots [ 11 and mid-infrared (MIR) four wave \nmixing experiments on localised modes of H- ions in calcium fluoride crystals [2]. We have made \nnew fadnear infrared double resonance measurements of self-assembled InAs\/GaAs quantum dots. \nThe FIR resonance is unambiguously associated with a bound-bound intraband transition in the \nneutral dots, and analysis of the FIR double resonance linewidth enables us to show that the \ninhomogeneous broadening of the PL cannot be attributed solely to size and composition \nfluctuation. In addition we have made time resolved studies of local modes in ionic crystals, where \nnon-radiative decay plays an important role in the optical pumping cycle of laser gain media. We \nhave made pump-probe studies of the local modes created upon the introduction of a light \nimpurity, in particular the H- ion, in CaFz in the spectral region 700 to 1200cm-'. We have also \nmeasured the free induction decay of this mode using a non-colinear degenerate four wave mixing \n(DFWM) geometry. The observed coherent transient is striking in having large quantum beat \nmodulations at negative time which are associated with vibrational ladder climbing. \n2. Double resonance spectroscopy of InAs\/GaAs self-assembled quantum dots \nThere have been many measurements of intraband spectroscopy in semiconductor quantum dots as \na means to probe the excited states, but we describe here a new intedintra-band double resonance \ninvestigation of quantum dots. The interest of this technique is that unlike FIR absorption or even \nphoto-induced FIR absorption it has allowed us to make an unequivocal assignment of the resonant \nelectronic bound-to-bound intraband absorption simultaneously with the interband excitonic \ntransition in neutral dots (i.e. giving the electron and hole splittings within the same dots, without \nthe need for n-type and p-type samples). These transitions may be strongly dependent on charge, \nand it is important to study the transitions in neutral systems since these are or primary \ntechnological interest. We have applied the technique to self-organised dots grown at a low \ngrowth-rate, which show well resolved photoluminescence (PL) lines. The double resonance and \nits polarisation selection rule allows us to identifjr not only the levels involved in the PL transition \nbut the relative importance of the causes of its inhomogeneous broadening. \nIn summary, we have measured the intersublevel absorption in self-assembled InAs\/GaAs quantum \ndots, and shown that higher energy PL lines arise from the in-plane confinement [l]. We make a \n0-7803-651 3-5\/00$10.00 @ 2000 IEEE. \n. .  \n163 \nW -E l  \nquantitative determination of the separation between both lowest electronic states and \ncorresponding hole states (E2-E1 = 55meV, H2-Hl = 13meV) in a single experiment. Lastly, the \nmeasurements of the inhomogeneity of our very narrow line width sample shows that mechanisms \nother than spatial size or potential depth fluctuations must also contribute to the broadening of the \nPL spectra. Very recently we have shown that when the samples are annealed, the PL is sharper, \nand we now observe a spatial hole in the PL which blue shifts as the FIR is shifted to shorter \nwavelengths. We therefore attribute the lack of spatial holes in the unannealed samples to indium \nfluctuations within the dots which are removed by the anneal. We determine from the width of the \nspatial hole the contribution to the inhomogeneous width due to size fluctuations. We also observe \na reduction in the wings of the PL characteristic of a line narrowing which we attribute to FIR \ninduced phase-locking of the of the driven oscillator system. This has previously been inferred \nfrom transport and intraband spectroscopy but has not been measured directly in interband \nmeasurements. \n3. Dynamics of hydrogenic localised vibrational modes \nThe development of near infrared solid state lasers, based around for example 3d2 configuration \nions such as Cr4+ and V3+, is hampered by heavy quenching of the optical excitation by non- \nradiative relaxation at room temperature. Recent studies have shown the importance of local mode \nvibrations of the optically active center in mediating the non-radiative multiphonon relaxation \nprocess. We report on pump-probe and free induction decay experiments on the localised \nvibrational modes of ionic hydrogen in CaF2 and LiYF4 crystals using the FELIX output in the ten \nmicron region. These systems are attractive for their simplicity, the only possible non-radiative path \nbeing into the lattice band modes [2]. Only one time-resolved study of these systems using pulses \nshorter than the local mode lifetime has been reported previously, and indeed no coherent \ninvestigations have been made. \nFor resonant excitation of the CaF2:H- mode at 9.36pm, a 10K lifetime of TI = 43ps has been \ndetermined by a three beam pump-probe technique. The temperature dependence of the decay rate \nfits well to a three phonon anharmonic decay process. In addition, we have observed giant \nquantum coherence effects in the localised modes. MlR free induction decay experiments show \nlarge modulations at negative delay times due to interference between multiple vibrational levels. \nSpectrally resolving the degenerate four wave mixing signal allows unambiguous assignment of the \nparticipating vibrational states. The dependence of the signal intensity upon the delay path between \nthe exciting free electron laser pulses, and in particular the quantum beats at negative times, can be \naccounted for theoretically in terms of the resonant third order polarisation with a common \ndephasing time for the excited states. The fit was obtained by adjusting the dephasing rate to fit \nthe positive delay signal, giving T2 = 8.0 k 0 . 5 ~ ~ .  This value corresponds closely to the linewidth \nof the spectrally resolved infrared free induction decay, and is consistent with the TI value (43ps) \nobtained from the pump-probe measurement. \n[ 11 B N Murdin, A R Hollingworth, D Clark, P C Findlay, C R Pidgeon, J-P Wells, I V Bradley, S \n[2] J-P Wells, C W Rella, I V Bradley, I Galbraith and C R Pidgeon, Phys.
