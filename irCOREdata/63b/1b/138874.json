Gams (synonym: Verticillium chlamydosporium Goddard) is an 36 \nimportant egg parasite of root-knot (Meloidogyne spp.), false root-knot (Nacobbus spp.) and 37 \ncyst (Heterodera spp. and Globodera spp.) nematodes. Since it was first found to be 38 \nassociated with the infection of plant-parasitic nematodes (Willcox & Tribe 1974; Kerry 39 \n1975), this fungus has been extensively studied as a potential biological control agent to 40 \ncontrol these pests  (De Leij & Kerry 1991; Sankaranarayanan et al. 2000; Ciancio et al. 2002; 41 \nAtkins et al. 2003a; Montes de Oca et al. 2005; Tzortzakakis 2007). In order to provide an 42 \nefficient level of control, P. chlamydosporia should become established in the plant 43 \nrhizosphere and survive, even in the absence of nematode hosts, and be able to infect (Kerry 44 \net al. 1993), to parasitise and to consume nematode eggs that might be present  (Kerry & 45 \nJaffee 1997).  46 \n  Particular extracellular enzymes secreted by P. chlamydosporia are thought to play an 47 \nimportant role in the infection of eggs (Huang et al. 2004; Morton et al. 2004) as they enable 48 \nthe fungus to degrade the host\u2019s major barrier to infection, the nematode eggshell, which is 49 \nmainly composed of an outer protein layer, a middle chitinous layer and an inner lipid layer 50 \n(Bird & McClure 1976). The range of enzymes secreted by the fungus enable it to penetrate 51 \nthe nematode eggshell and the body wall of the juvenile within (Morgan-Jones et al. 1983). 52 \nSpecific proteases and chitinases have been isolated from P. chlamydosporia and have shown 53 \nactivity against the nematode eggshell (Segers 1996; Tikhonov et al. 2002). These have been 54 \nisolated and purified and are considered to be involved in the infection process serving as 55 \nvirulence factors (Huang et al. 2004).  56 \n During the infection process, a 33 kDa subtilisin-like serine protease, designated 57 \nVCP1, is produced by the fungus (Segers et al. 1994). Immunolocalization of this enzyme at 58 \nthe penetration site indicates that VCP1 degrades the vitelline membrane on the surface of the 59 \neggshell and exposes the chitin layer (Segers et al. 1996). This enzyme is serologically and 60 \nfunctionally related to Pr1, the much studied enzyme produced by the entomopathogenic 61 \nfungus Metarhizium  anisopliae (Segers et al. 1995).  62 \n Chitinolytic activity was detected in Pochonia spp. when grown in a solid and a liquid 63 \nmedium containing colloidal chitin as an inducer (Dackman et al. 1989). Dupont et al. (1999) 64 \ndetected the presence of both endo- and exochitinases in cultures of P. chlamydosporia 65 \ngrowing in a chitin-rich medium, and they studied the effects of these chitinases on the 66 \neggshell of M. incognita eggs using fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. Both 67 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 4\nenzymes weakened the nematode eggshell and caused it to become dented within 24 hours. 68 \nTikhonov et al. (2002) were the first to purify and to characterize chitinases from P. 69 \nchlamydosporia and Pochonia rubescens. In their study, they were able to identify an 70 \nendochitinase (CHI43) from both fungi when grown in a semiliquid medium containing chitin 71 \nas the main source of C and N. When eggs of Globodera pallida were treated with CHI43, 72 \nscars on the surface of the egg were observed, and these were more pronounced in eggs 73 \ntreated with both CHI43 and a protease purified from P. rubescens (P32). Similar results were 74 \nobserved in M. incognita eggs treated with proteases and chitinases from Paecilomyces 75 \nlilacinus-treated eggs, suggesting that for effective penetration of nematode eggs, 76 \nnematophagous fungi must produce protease and chitinase enzymes at the same time to 77 \ndegrade different eggshell layers (Khan et al. 2004).  78 \n The importance of lipases and esterases in the infection process of nematophagous 79 \nfungi is less clear and studied. Lipolytic activity by P. chlamydosporia was detected after 30 80 \ndays incubation by Mendonza de Gives et al. (2003) when the fungus was grown in a rich 81 \nmedium containing soya and peptone. However, Olivares-Bernabeu & Lopez-Llorca (2002) 82 \nfound lipolytic activity in different isolates of P. chlamydosporia, isolated from Spanish soils, 83 \nafter seven days of growth in solid media (Olivares-Bernabeu & Lopez-Llorca 2002). They 84 \nalso found that lipolytic activity varied with the fungal isolate and was always lower than 85 \nprotease activity.  86 \n In this work, a group of P. chlamydosporia isolates were tested for differences in their 87 \nabilities to produce a range of extracellular enzymes. Isolates are known to differ in terms of 88 \ntheir virulence against nematode eggs (Irving & Kerry 1986) and ability to colonise the 89 \nrhizosphere (De Leij & Kerry 1991), and it was hypothesised that they may also differ in their 90 \nabilities to produce particular extracellular enzymes. The aim of this work was to determine 91 \nwhich nutritional conditions influence enzyme production and to determine if a relationship 92 \ncould be established between differences in enzyme production, in vitro egg parasitism and 93 \nrhizosphere colonisation. Are isolates with the best parasitic performance good rhizosphere 94 \ncolonisers and enzyme producers, or vice-versa? Can the in vitro production of certain 95 \nenzymes be related to saprotrophic \/parasitic in vitro growth? 96 \n The specific objectives of this study were: (i) to investigate the production of enzymes 97 \nby the fungus on different medium amendments; (ii) to quantify the amounts of enzymes 98 \nsecreted by the fungus at different times, (iii) to assess whether differences exist between 99 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 5\nfungal isolates in the production of enzymes (types and amounts), and (iv) to determine if 100 \nenzyme production is related to in vitro egg parasitism and rhizosphere colonisation. 101 \n 102 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 6\nMaterials and methods 103 \nOrigin of cultures and characterisation  104 \n The eleven isolates of P. chlamydosporia used in this study were selected from the 105 \n400 different isolates in the Rothamsted Research (England, UK) culture collection. The 106 \nselection criteria were based on prior information about each of the isolates in terms of host 107 \nnematode and geographic origin, in order to have isolates from different hosts, substrata and 108 \ngeographic origins. All the isolates (Table 1) were previously tested for the presence of the 109 \nspecific diagnostic primers derived from the \u00df-tubulin gene, and confirmed to be P. 110 \nchlamydosporia var. chlamydosporia using PCR (Hirsch et al. 2000). DNA fingerprinting 111 \nenabled the discrimination between different isolates of  P. chlamydosporia grown in pure 112 \nculture (Arora et al. 1996). The isolate 392, originally isolated from Cuba, was identified as P. 113 \nchlamydosporia var. catenulata, and could also be distinguished from isolates of P. 114 \nchlamydosporia var. chlamydosporia using specific PCR primers (Atkins et al. 2003b).  115 \n 116 \nQuantitative studies on the production of extracellular enzymes   117 \n Eleven P. chlamydosporia isolates (Table 1) were cultured in minimal liquid medium 118 \n(0.3 g l-1 NaCl, 0.3 g l-1 MgSO4.7H2O, 0.3 g l-1 K2HPO4 and 0.2 g l-1 of yeast extract (Merck, 119 \nGermany) and in the same medium supplemented with:  120 \n a) 0.2 % gelatin (from porcine skin, Sigma); gelatin was filtered through a Millipore 121 \nfilter (45 \u00b5m aperture) before it was added aseptically into autoclaved medium. 122 \n b) 1 % (w\/v) chitin (from crab shells, practical grade, Sigma); chitin sieved through a 123 \n30 mesh aperture sieve before use. This medium had to be poured aseptically in constant 124 \nagitation to ensure its homogeneity (Segers 1996).  125 \n c) 2 % (v\/v) extra virgin olive oil and 0.25 % sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) (w\/v). 126 \nStock solutions of SDS and olive oil were prepared and were added aseptically to the 127 \nautoclaved medium individually. 128 \n The experiment had different aims. The first aim was to study the production of 129 \nenzymes by the different isolates on the different medium amendments. The medium, in 130 \nwhich enzyme activity was greatest, for each enzyme, was selected in order to study temporal 131 \nchanges in enzyme activity and time of secretion (three, five and seven days). After five days 132 \ngrowth, isolates of P. chlamydosporia were compared for the types and amounts of different 133 \nenzymes produced. 134 \n  135 \n 136 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 7\nExperimental conditions and fungal inoculation:  137 \n Twenty millilitres of each medium were poured into 50 ml plastic tubes and were 138 \ninoculated with four agar plugs (5 mm) colonised with the fungus (three replicates per isolate, 139 \nper medium and per each day of sampling). Samples were incubated in the dark, at 28 \u00b0C, in 140 \nan orbital shaking incubator at 120 rpm (Gallenkamp). After three, five and seven days, the 141 \nsupernatant was collected and filtered using filter paper (Whatman N\u00b0 1). In order to reduce 142 \nthe volume of each sample, the supernatant was freeze-dried and re-suspended in 1 ml of 143 \nsterile distilled water to be measured for enzyme production.  144 \n Total protein concentration was measured according to Bradford (1976) using the Bio-145 \nRad protein assay kit. A standard curve was calculated using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as 146 \nstandard at a concentration of between 1.42 to 10 \u00b5g ml-1, from a standard solution of 0.1 mg 147 \nml-1 BSA. Absorbance was measured in a multicsan MRX plate reader (Dynex Technologies 148 \nLtd, UK), at 495 nm.  Enzyme activity was determined by using different enzyme assays: 149 \n I. Lipase, esterase and exochitinases activity was accessed using chromogenic p-150 \nnitrophenyl substrates (15 mM of 4-nitrophenyl palmitate, 15 mM of 4-nitrophenyl acetate, 151 \nand 2 mM of 4-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminide, respectively). Enzyme extract, 152 \nsubstrate solution (40 \u00b5l) and the appropriate buffer (20 \u00b5l; 25 mM l-1 acetate, pH 4.2) were 153 \npipetted into the wells of a 96 well microtitre plate (Bibby Sterilin, UK) and incubated at 37 154 \n\u00baC for 1 h, using a boiled (100 \u00baC, 10 min.) enzyme extract as a control. The reaction was 155 \nstopped by the addition of 5 \u00b5l of 1 mol l-1 sodium carbonate solution and left for three 156 \nminutes. The enzyme activity was estimated using a MRX multiscan plate reader by 157 \nmeasuring the increase in optical density at 405 nm caused by the liberation of \u03c1-nitrophenol 158 \nby enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate. Specific activity was expressed as units of enzyme 159 \n(U). One unit (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme that liberates 1 nmol p-nitrophenol 160 \nmin-1 ml-1 \u00b5g of protein.  161 \n II. Proteolytic activity was determined using azocasein, a chromogenic substrate. 162 \nEnzyme extract (20 \u00b5l) and sulphanilamide Azocasein (1 % in 0.2 M Tris-Hcl buffer, pH 7.5) 163 \nwere pipetted into the wells of a 96 well microtitre plate and incubated at 37 \u00baC for 1 h using a 164 \nboiled enzyme extract as a control, as described above. The reaction was stopped by the 165 \naddition of 150 \u00b5l of trichloroacetic acid (10 % w\/v) and neutralised by adding 50 \u00b5l of 1M 166 \nNaOH. Plates were centrifuged (3000 rpm, 10 minutes) and supernatants (150 \u00b5l) transferred 167 \nto a 96 well half-size enzymoimmunoassay plate (175 \u00b5l cavities). Blank samples were 168 \nprepared similarly but with an inactivated enzyme solution (100 \u00baC, 10 min.), and absorbance 169 \nmeasured at 440 nm in the MRX multiscan plate reader.

One unit of protease activity is 173 \ndefined as the amount of enzyme that produces an increase in absorbance of 1 in 1h at 440 174 \nnm. 175 \n III. VCP1 activity was assayed using N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe p-nitroanilide 176 \n(Segers et al. 1994). Enzyme extract (2 \u00b5l), substrate (100 \u00b5l) and buffer (98 \u00b5l of 0.1 M Tris 177 \nHCl pH 7.9) were mixed in microtubes (500 \u00b5l), and absorbance was immediately and 178 \ncontinuously measured at 410 nm for three minutes at room temperature, using a 179 \nspectrophotometer (CaryWin UV). One unit of activity (U) was defined as the amount of 180 \nenzyme that releases 1 \u00b5mol p-nitroanilide min-1ml-1.  181 \nDesign and statistical analysis:  To compare the effects of different medium amendments, 182 \ntime of secretion and differences between isolates, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was 183 \napplied to the data using GenStat\u00ae (2007). The data were checked to ensure the normality of 184 \nvariance by plotting histograms of residuals and plotting the residuals against the fitted 185 \nvalues. Where data showed a clear skewed distribution, they were log transformed to the 186 \nspecific enzyme activity plus an adjustment (1) to account for zero observations. Following 187 \nANOVA, least significant differences (LSD) were used to statistically separate the means at 5 188 \n% level of confidence. 189 \n 190 \nEnzyme production and relationship with in vitro egg parasitism (parasitic growth) and 191 \nrhizosphere colonisation (saprotrophic growth) 192 \n To determine if there was a relationship between enzyme production (proteases, 193 \nchitinases, lipases and esterases), parasitic growth and saprotrophic growth, data for enzyme 194 \nproduction, in vitro egg parasitism and rhizosphere colonisation were collected and analysed 195 \nusing Kendall\u2019s coefficient of concordance and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. 196 \nKendall\u2019s coefficient of concordance measures the degree of correspondence between two or 197 \nmore rankings and assesses the significance of this correspondence (Kendall & Gibbons 198 \n1990).

Tiny Tim) grown in a temperature-controlled glasshouse, at 25 \u00b0C. 213 \nG.  pallida cysts were separated from infested soil, using the Fenwick can method (Fenwick 214 \n1940). The soil was kindly supplied by Andy Barker (Rothamsted Research, UK). To release 215 \nthe eggs, cysts were crushed using a cyst crusher (Reid 1955) and were suspended in water, 216 \npassed through a 125 \u00b5m aperture sieve to remove any soil or cyst debris and were collected 217 \non a 30 \u00b5m aperture sieve before being used in the experiment. Briefly, Pochonia 218 \nchlamydosporia cultures growing on corn meal agar were flooded with 5 ml of sterile distilled 219 \nwater, and aliquots of 0.2 ml of fungal suspension were spread onto Petri dishes (9 cm 220 \ndiameter) containing 0.8 % water agar with antibiotics. After 2 days of incubation at 25 \u00b0C , 221 \napproximately 200 root-knot nematode eggs (Meloidogyne spp.) or cyst nematode eggs (G. 222 \npallida) were added to each plate. The Petri dishes were incubated at 25\u00b0C and after 3 days 223 \nthe number of parasitised eggs was counted. Three plates per isolate per nematode species 224 \nwere made, and the experiment was repeated twice. To compare differences between isolates, 225 \nANOVA was applied to the data using GenStat\u00ae (2007). The analysis used a logit 226 \ntransformation to ensure the normality of variance (Gomez & Gomez 1984). 227 \n 228 \n 229 \nAssessment of saprotrophic growth (rhizosphere colonisation test) 230 \nRoot colonisation was measured in maize, adapting the protocol described by Abrantes et al. 231 \n(1998). Maize seeds were surface-sterilised in an 8% solution of sodium hypochlorite with 232 \none drop of Tween 20 and shaken in a wrist shaker for 1 h. The seeds were then washed five 233 \ntimes in sterile distilled water and dried for 30 minutes inside a laminar flow cabinet. The 234 \nsterilised maize seeds (Zea mays L., cv.  Katumani) were inoculated with chlamydospores 235 \nfrom P. chlamydosporia at a rate of 3x104 spores per seed and planted in pots containing 236 \napproximately 250 ml of sterilised moist vermiculite. After eight days, roots were taken out 237 \nfrom the pots, cut in 1 cm sections and plated on water agar with antibiotics (0.05 g l-1 238 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 10\nstreptomycin sulphate, 0.05 g l-1 chloramphenicol and 0.05 g l-1 chlortetracycline). The 239 \nnumber of colonised roots and percentage of root colonisation were determined after two days 240 \nincubation at 25 \u00b0C. The experiment contained three replicates for each treatment 241 \ncombination and was repeated twice. To compare differences between isolates, ANOVA was 242 \napplied to the data using GenStat\u00ae (2007). The analysis used a logit transformation to ensure 243 \nthe normality of variance (Gomez & Gomez 1984).  244 \n 245 \nResults 246 \nQuantitative studies on the production of extracellular enzymes      247 \nEnzyme activity in response to medium amendments 248 \n The amounts of enzymes which were produced by P. chlamydosporia isolates during 249 \nfive days of growth in liquid media varied according to the media (p<0.05) in which the fungi 250 \nwere grown. Proteolytic activity was significantly greater (p<0.05, using LSD) in minimal 251 \nmedium than in a medium containing gelatin (Fig 1-A) (means of proteases on the log scale 252 \nfor the media: minimal medium 1.018, chitin 0.419, gelatin 0.543, olive oil 0.480; LSD (5 %) 253 \n= 0.1947). The secretion of chitinases was greater (p<0.05) in a medium supplemented with 254 \ngelatin than in one enriched with chitin, or when the fungi were grown in minimal medium 255 \n(Fig 1-B) (means of chitinases on the log scale for the media: minimal medium 0.260, chitin 256 \n0.007, gelatin 1.395; LSD (5 %) = 0.1005). The greatest amounts of chitinases were produced 257 \nby isolates 16, 69, 132 and 280, whereas the least amounts were measured in isolates 60, 392, 258 \n399 and 400 (Fig 1-B). Lipolytic activity was low in most of the isolates and in all the media 259 \ntested, being significantly greater (p<0.05) in the medium supplemented with olive oil (Fig 1-260 \nC) (means of lipases on the log scale for the media: minimal medium 0.040, gelatin 0.087, 261 \nolive oil 0.234; LSD (5 %) = 0.1295). Isolates 69, 104, 132, 280 and 309 did not produce this 262 \nenzyme in any of the media tested (Fig 1-C). Esterase production was higher (p<0.05) in the 263 \nmedium supplemented with gelatin but was repressed in media enriched with the olive oil, 264 \nwhere this enzyme was not detected in most of the isolates (Fig 1-D) (means of esterases on 265 \nthe log scale for the media: minimal medium 0.421, gelatin 1.078, olive oil 0.056; LSD (5 %) 266 \n= 0.1283). The activity of VCP1 was detected in all the isolates when grown in the medium 267 \nsupplemented with chitin, but its production was more variable when isolates were grown in 268 \nminimal medium or medium enriched with gelatin (Fig 2) (means of VCP1 on the log scale 269 \nfor the media: minimal medium 0.307, chitin 0.575, gelatin 0.212; LSD (5 %) = 0.0792). In 270 \nmedium supplemented with chitin, isolate 69 showed the highest VCP1 activity among all 271 \nisolates, equivalent to 5.3 U (Fig 2).  272 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 11\n 273 \nEnzyme activity and time of secretion       274 \n Enzyme activity differed with time and isolate. For the majority of the isolates, the 275 \nproduction of proteases in a non-supplemented medium, did not differ significantly (p>0.05) 276 \nbetween the first two sampling occasions but decreased significantly by day seven (Fig 3-A) 277 \n(means of proteases on the log scale for days: day three 0.945, day five 1.018, day seven 278 \n0.795; LSD = 0.1412). Chitinolytic activity was greater after five days of growth for the 279 \nmajority of the isolates (p<0.05), and then decreased significantly (p<0.05) after this time (Fig 280 \n3-B) (means of chitinases on the log scale for days: day three 0.599, day five 1.395, day seven 281 \n1.199; LSD = 0.1462). Lipases were secreted in small amounts when compared with the 282 \nproduction of the other enzymes assayed, and were in general produced later (Fig 3-C). 283 \nHowever, differences between days five and seven were not significant (means of lipases on 284 \nthe log scale for days: day three 0.103, day five 0.234, day seven 0.304; LSD = 0.1354). 285 \nThere were no significant differences between secretion of esterases and time (p>0.05) (Fig 3-286 \nD) (means of esterases on the log scale for days: day three 0.966, day five 1.078, day seven 287 \n0.958; LSD = 0.1605). 288 \n 289 \nEnzyme activity in different isolates of Pochonia chlamydosporia after five days of 290 \ngrowth  291 \n The comparison between isolates of P. chlamydosporia on the production of 292 \nextracellular enzymes revealed significant differences between isolates (F10, 85 = 7.71, 293 \np<0.001) and amounts of enzymes produced (F3, 85 = 114.86, p<0.001) when data were 294 \nanalysed using ANOVA. Significantly greater amounts of chitinases were produced (mean 295 \n35.27 U \u00b1 2.5; log mean 1.395), compared with esterases (18.49 U \u00b1 2.0; log mean 1.078) and 296 \nproteases (10.78 U \u00b1 1.6; log mean 1.018) which were produced in similar quantities (p>0.05, 297 \nusing LSD = 0.1295). Lipases (1.41 U \u00b1 0.7, log mean 0.234) were the least secreted enzymes 298 \n(Fig 4). Also there was a highly significant interaction between isolates and enzymes (F30, 85 = 299 \n4.27; p<0.001). 300 \n 301 \nEnzyme production and relationship with in vitro egg parasitism and rhizosphere 302 \ncolonisation 303 \n Highly significant differences were found between isolates on the ability to parasitise 304 \nnematode eggs in vitro (Meloidogyne eggs: F 8, 26 = 23.59, p< 0.001; G. pallida: F 8, 26 = 305 \n18.11, p<0.001) and to colonise the rhizosphere of maize (F 8, 25 = 11.07, p<0.001) using 306 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 12\nANOVA. However, the analysis of data using Kendall\u2019s coefficient of concordance and 307 \nSpearman\u2019s rank of correlation showed no significant relationships between enzyme 308 \nproduction, egg parasitism or saprotrophic growth (rhizosphere colonisation) (coefficient = 309 \n0.110, adjusted for ties 0.113; p= 0.611) (Tables 2 and 3). Isolate 16 was the highest ranked 310 \namong the nine isolates analysed, and although it was the most extensive rhizosphere 311 \ncoloniser and the best producer of proteases and chitinases, it was only average in terms of 312 \nparasitizing eggs (Table 2). In contrast, the second ranked isolate 280, a poor saprotroph in 313 \nthe rhizosphere of maize, was the most virulent egg parasite in the in vitro tests and the best 314 \nproducer of chitinases (Table 2). Isolate 400 was the lowest ranked, and although it was a 315 \nweak parasite and a good rhizosphere coloniser, it produced very small amounts of enzymes, 316 \nwith the exception of lipases (Table 2). Furthermore, Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient 317 \nshowed no significant correlations between the different enzymes studied, parasitism or 318 \nsaprotrophic growth (Table 3) apart from a strong correlation (p =0.001) found between 319 \nprotease and lipase production. 320 \n 321 \nDiscussion 322 \nQuantitative studies on the production of extracellular enzymes   323 \nPochonia chlamydosporia isolates produced varied amounts of enzymes and 324 \nresponded differently when supplements were added to the medium. Gelatin induced the 325 \nproduction of chitinases and esterases but surprisingly did not increase the production of 326 \nproteases and VCP1. The gelatin was obtained from porcine skin and may have favoured the 327 \nproduction of other enzymes apart from proteases. In a previous study, the use of a higher 328 \nconcentration of gelatin (1% instead of 0.2% used in this study) strongly repressed VCP1 329 \nactivity, as did albumin, whereas fibrous collagen enhanced protease production (Segers 330 \n1996). It was concluded that the inductive effect of protein was not a generic response, and 331 \nthat the response depended on the source of protein used.  332 \n Similarly, chitinase activity was not induced in the medium amended with chitin but 333 \nincreased the activity of VCP1. The type of chitin used was of practical grade (from crab 334 \nshell), and although it was washed and sieved before use, it may have contained other 335 \nnutrients apart from chitin which could have induced other enzymes such as VCP1. Because 336 \nchitin is insoluble in water, it  may have been less accessible to the fungus and did not induce 337 \nthe production of chitinases. The physical presence of chitin in suspension, absent in other 338 \nmedia tested, may have provided physical support for fungal growth, and this may have been 339 \nanother reason for the production of the serine protease VCP1 being favoured. High VCP1 340 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 13\ntitres were also found by Segers (1996) using a similar source of chitin in suspension. 341 \nFurthermore, in the same study, the combined use of chitin and collagen, both insoluble, 342 \nresulted in an increased VCP1 activity (Segers 1996). Interestingly, all the isolates tested 343 \nshowed VCP1 activity in the medium containing chitin. In contrast, the cyst nematode isolate 344 \nisolated from spores in New Zealand (isolate 69) and the root-knot nematode isolate isolated 345 \nfrom soil in Cuba (isolate 392) which is a variant, P. chlamydosporia var. catenulata, had 346 \nsignificantly lower VCP1 activity in the minimal medium and the medium amended with 347 \ngelatin. The apparently lower activity of the enzyme in these two isolates could be due to 348 \nreduced substrate affinity rather than a less active serine protease and, therefore, the results 349 \nmay have been influenced by the substrate used in the assay [Suc-(Ala)2-Pro-Phe-pNA]. 350 \nMorton (2003) showed differences in the structure of VCP1 enzyme between isolates isolated 351 \nfrom root-knot and cyst nematodes. Differences were observed on the rim of the substrate-352 \nbinding region where a glycine in the enzyme from isolates from root-knot nematodes was 353 \nreplaced by a larger alanine in isolates from cyst nematodes. Polymorphisms were also found 354 \nat position 57, where a glutamic acid in the enzyme from isolates from root-knot nematodes 355 \nwas replaced by a glutamine in isolates isolated from cyst nematodes. Therefore, it is possible 356 \nthat the serine proteases produced by the two isolates, 69 and 392 are substantially different 357 \nfrom proteases produced by the other isolates tested.  358 \n In this study, the production of enzymes secreted in amended and non-amended media 359 \nvaried with time. Although the enzyme activities were detected using artificial substrates, they 360 \nmight mimic the response of P. chlamydosporia when in contact with nematode eggs. 361 \nBecause the first layer of the nematode eggshell contains mainly protein, proteases may be the 362 \nfirst enzymes to be secreted by the germinating fungus but they are also required through time 363 \nin order to degrade the middle and inner eggshell layers that also contain protein, chitin and 364 \nlipids. Proteases may also be required to degrade the protein contained in the juvenile 365 \nnematode within the egg and to emerge from the eggshell after the egg\u2019s contents are 366 \nconsumed. The time of secretion of these two enzymes is also considered to be important in 367 \nentomopathogenic fungi, in which proteases are secreted in the initial stages of infection, 368 \nfollowed by chitinases (St. Leger et al. 1986). The production by mycopathogens of 369 \nexochitinases in the late stage of infection may play a role in inhibiting the development of 370 \nother microbial competitors for chitin (Wattanalai et al. 2004). In this study, chitinases were 371 \nthe enzymes secreted with greatest specific activity, followed by esterases and proteases. The 372 \neggshell layer which contains chitin is the thickest of the three layers (Bird & Bird 1991) and 373 \nis probably the reason why the fungus produces large amounts of this enzyme.  374 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 14\n The role of esterases in the physiology of this fungus is not clear. Segers (1996) 375 \ndetected high esterase activity in culture filtrates of P. chlamydosporia and in pure VCP1 376 \nenzyme and found that VCP1 was highly active in the hydrolisation of short (C4-C6) and 377 \nmedium (C7-C10) chain esters whereas Pr1, a serine protease secreted by M. anisopliae, was 378 \nactive against short chain esters only. The ability to degrade both long and short chains of 379 \nesters may reflect the nutritional versatility of P. chlamydosporia. Esterases are known to be 380 \nimportant in fungal metabolic processes and in substrate degradation but their role in 381 \nvirulence has not been investigated in nematophagous fungi. However, these results are the 382 \nfirst to quantify the production of these enzymes by this fungus. Furthermore, a high 383 \ncompetitive saprotrophic ability, rapid spore germination and high growth rate can depend on 384 \na high production of extracellular enzymes (Faull 1988). Pochonia chlamydosporia might not 385 \nbe considered a fungus with great saprotrophic ability (Widden 1997) since it is a weak 386 \ncompetitor in soil, (Bourne & Kerry 2000), however, it must produce enzymes to survive as a 387 \nsaprotroph. 388 \n Although lipolytic activity was low, there was the suggestion that lipases might have 389 \nbeen produced later in time, with most of the isolates increasing activity for degradation of 390 \nlipids after seven days of growth in the medium amended with olive oil. Extra virgin olive oil 391 \nwas chosen among other types of lipid sources because it was shown to increase lipolytic 392 \nactivity in Fusarium solani (Maia et al. 1999) and  M.  anisopliae (Silva et al. 2005). 393 \nDifferent results might have been achieved if a different source of lipid or substrate had been 394 \nused.  395 \n The selection of isolates for potential biocontrol of nematodes and insects has included 396 \nstudies on enzyme production (Barranco-Florido et al. 2002; Olivares-Bernabeu & Lopez-397 \nLlorca 2002). Such studies may help to differentiate isolates to some extent (Carder et al. 398 \n1993) but other parameters such as virulence, saprotrophic ability and spore production 399 \nshould be considered in the selection of potential biocontrol agents. In this study, differences 400 \nin enzyme production were found between isolates of P. chlamydosporia. However, the 401 \namounts and types of enzymes secreted by individual isolates were shown to differ with 402 \nnutrition and time; therefore, cultural conditions appear to have an important effect on the 403 \nresults obtained and must always be standardised for meaningful comparisons to be made. 404 \nAlthough a strong correlation was found between proteolytic and lipolytic activity, there was 405 \nno correlation between enzyme activity with in vitro egg parasitism or saprotrophic growth 406 \n(rhizosphere colonisation). Complex interactions occur between different abiotic and biotic 407 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 15\nfactors, which influence pathogenicity, and more work is required to identify the factors 408 \naffecting the virulence and saprotrophic growth of P. chlamydosporia isolates. 409 \n The research presented in this paper provides new information about the influence of 410 \nenzyme inducers, times of secretion and amounts of extracellular enzymes (proteases, 411 \nchitinases, lipases and esterases) which are produced by different P. chlamydosporia isolates. 412 \nSuch information is important to increase understanding about the physiology of the fungus. 413 \nThe existence of differences between isolates in their ability to produce enzymes, parasitise 414 \nnematode eggs and colonized roots in vitro reinforces the need for careful selection when 415 \nscreening for potential biocontrol agents.  416 \n 417 \nAcknowledgements 418 \nThe authors are grateful for the financial support received from the EU for the project, ICA4-419 \nCT-2002-10044, MiCoSPA - Microbial Pest Control for Sustainable Peri-Urban\/Urban 420 \nAgriculture in Latin America (Cuba and Mexico) and to Rothamsted International for 421 \nsponsoring Belkis Peteira.
