Yet, very little is known about the mechanisms and geographic \npreconditions underlying their diffusion, particularly at the global level. In this paper we seek to \nfill this gap using the example of ISO 9000, the internationally-recognized set of standards for \nquality management. We develop a series of hypotheses about the conditions under which \norganizations are most likely to adopt ISO 9000 which we test using panel data for 130 countries \nover the period 1995-2001. Our findings support the idea that transnational networks connecting \ndifferent countries at the international level provide conduits for the cross-national transfer of \nnew organizational practices. Thus, exports to the EU, local involvement of transnational \ncorporations (TNCs), European colonial ties, and the availability of telecommunications, all \nemerge as statistically significant determinants of ISO adoptions. Our findings also underscore \nthe importance of national environmental conditions in influencing the receptiveness of \norganizations to new practices. Low regulatory burden, a high share of manufacturing activity, \nhigh rates of secondary school enrolment, and low levels of productivity, are positively \ncorrelated with the number of ISO 9000 certificates. The paper concludes by discussing the \nimplications of our findings for current debates about the mechanisms, preconditions and scales \nof organizational transfer, diffusion and convergence.  \n \nKeywords: ISO 9000, standards, cross-national diffusion, globalization, institutionalism \n 2 \nIntroduction \n \nThe aim of this paper is to explain cross-national variations in the diffusion of ISO 9000, a series \nof voluntary private standards, developed and promoted by the Geneva-based International \nOrganization for Standardization (ISO). The standards define procedures for quality management \nand are intended to provide external assurance of quality to customers. \n Following their release in 1987 take-up of ISO 9000 advanced most rapidly in the \nEuropean Union (EU). Many other developed and developing countries have since adopted the \nstandards such that by December 2001, the end of our study period, 161 countries were host to \nISO 9000 certified facilities. Yet, despite its geographic spread, the number of certified facilities \nremains highly uneven across the globe.  \nFor geographers such cross-country variations in the take-up of ISO 9000 are of \nparticular interest. This is because they provide a unique opportunity to investigate the factors \nshaping the cross-national transfer, diffusion and convergence of organizational innovations at \nthe global level. There is growing recognition that such innovations \u2013 ideas, practices, strategies, \netc. \u2013 can have a profound influence on the geography of economic activity. Thus, productivity \nlevels, competitiveness, firm structure, buyer-supplier relations, and the geographical distribution \nof supply chains, are all shaped by organizational innovations (Storper 1987; Al\u00e4nge, Jacobsson \nand Jarnehammar 1998; Thrift 1998; Bryson 2000; Bathelt and Gl\u00fcckler 2003; Sturgeon 2003).  \nYet, despite their obvious importance, relatively little is known about the mechanisms \nand geographic preconditions underpinning the diffusion of organizational innovations (Gertler \n2001). This gap is particularly acute at the global scale. Thus, while a number of studies have \nexamined the cross-national transfer of corporate practices, these have largely been based on \n 3 \ncase-study evidence drawn from a small number of nation-states (Florida and Kenney 1992; \nGooderham, Nordhaug and Ringdal 1999; Kollman and Prakash 2001; Clark, Mansfield and \nTickell 2002). What is more, few of these studies have sought to identify generic facilitators \nand\/or barriers (Sturdy 2001), focusing instead on nationally idiosyncratic institutions promoting \nand\/or inhibiting acceptance of \u201cimported\u201d ideologies, practices and strategies (Pauly and Reich \n1997; Argent 2002; Christopherson 2002). In fact, only a handful of studies have empirically \ninvestigated the cross-national transfer of organizational innovations at the global scale, with the \nresult that many questions remain unanswered about the generic mechanisms and preconditions \nfor organizational convergence.  \nA major reason for this gap in the literature is the lack of reliable data. Unlike many \ntechnological innovations \u2013 steel furnaces, telecommunications, etc. (Perkins and Neumayer \n2004b) \u2013 little comparable data exist on the take-up of organizational innovations across multiple \ncountries. An important exception is ISO 9000. The International Organization for \nStandardization (ISO) has collected data on national certification counts since 1993, providing \nvaluable insight into the cross-national diffusion of organizational practices at the global scale. \nGiven this coverage it is perhaps surprising that only one previous study has investigated \nthe global diffusion of ISO 9000. Adopting a new-institutionalist framework, Guler, Guill\u00e9n and \nMacpherson (2002) use regression analysis to examine the influence of several hypothesized \nfactors on national certification counts. The authors find that the number of ISO 9000 certificates \nis positively correlated with levels of inward foreign direct investment, government \nconsumption, wealth and size of the labor force. Moreover, suggesting that organizational \npractices diffuse within networks of social influence, they find that countries which enjoy close \n 4 \ntrade ties and\/or are similar in terms of the products they trade are more likely to have a similar \nnumber of ISO 9000 certificates.  \nIn this paper we follow a similar approach. Yet we extend their analysis in three \nimportant ways. First, whereas Guler, Guill\u00e9n and Macpherson hypothesize that the uptake of \nISO 9000 is primarily governed by institutionalized pressures for organizational conformity, our \nanalytical framework recognizes that adoption decisions may additionally be influenced by \nefficiency motives. Besides social influence through network ties, therefore, we test for the \ninfluence of several geographic factors hypothesized to influence the profitability of ISO 9000 \ncertification. Second, in contrast to Guler, Guill\u00e9n and Macpherson, we use a lagged dependent \nvariable. This facilitates identification of the geographic determinants of adoption by helping us \nto control for self-reinforcing bandwagon dynamics. And third, our dataset includes a far larger \nnumber of countries (N=130), providing a more globally-representative test of the determinants \nof organizational diffusion. Data limitations mean that Guler, Guill\u00e9n and Macpherson are forced \nto omit a substantial number of countries from the analysis (N=85), opening-up the possibility of \nsample selection bias in their estimations. \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the origins, nature and \nrequirements of ISO 9000. Section 3 briefly reviews the existing theoretical literature on the \ndiffusion of technological and organizational innovations. Section 4 develops a series of \nhypotheses regarding the determinants of national certification counts. Section 5 describes data \nand methods used in the study and Section 6 presents results. Discussion and conclusions are \nprovided in Section 7.  \n \n 5 \nThe nature and implications of ISO 9000 \n \nOne of the defining features of the global business environment over the past two decades has \nbeen the emergence of quality as a key factor in competitive success (van der Wiele, Dale and \nWilliams 2000; Withers and Ebrahimpour 2000). Accompanying this so-called \u201cquality \nrevolution\u201d has been a succession of organizational innovations designed to assist firms in \nquality management. Originally these innovations \u2013 for example, quality circles, total quality \nmanagement (TQM), just-in-time (JIT), etc. \u2013 were based on loosely codified principles \narticulated by consultants and management texts. More recently, however, standardized systems \nof quality management have been developed, first at the national level, and subsequently the \ninternational one.  \n The emergence of quality management standards has not taken place in isolation. Rather, \nthey are part of a broader trend towards governance through standardization (Abbott and Snidal \n2001; Sturgeon 2003). This trend has been especially pronounced at the global level where \ngrowing cross-border economic integration has heightened the need for common standards to \nfacilitate co-operation and co-ordination between firms. In the absence of a global state the task \nof designing, implementing and enforcing standards has increasingly been taken-up by various \nregional and\/or global institutions. Some of these are governmental organizations. Many others, \nhowever, are non-governmental. Their involvement in standard-setting has gone hand-in-hand \nwith a more general shift towards private sector involvement in areas of governance traditionally \noccupied by the state (Brunsson and Jacobsson 2000; Coe and Yeung 2001; Sassen 2001). \n  The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is the largest and perhaps best-\nknown private standard-setting body at the global level. Comprising national standard institutes \n 6 \nfrom 130 countries, its overarching goal has been to facilitate international trade and investment \nby harmonizing otherwise diverse and conflicting national standards with international ones \n(Stevenson and Barnes 2001). The majority of the ISO\u2019s standards are technical in nature, \ndefining the specifications that various products should possess. The ISO 9000 series, by \ncontrast, are procedural standards. Rather than standardizing technical specifications, the \nstandards define a comprehensive set of quality management practices. Their chief purpose is to \nprovide external quality assurance to customers by demonstrating a supplier\u2019s compliance with a \nformalized quality management system.   \nThe ISO 9000 series was originally released in 1987 and subsequently revised and \nupdated in 1994 and 2000. The series comprises five individual standards. Two of these, ISO \n9000 and ISO 9004, are so-called guidance standards designed to assist applicants of ISO 9000 \nin quality system improvement. While the other three, ISO 9001, ISO 9002 and ISO 9003, are \ncontractual standards. They define the basic requirements for establishing, maintaining and \ndocumenting a certifiable quality management system. As of December 2000, these three \nstandards were replaced by a single one, ISO 9000: 2000. A parallel set of procedural standards \nfor environmental management systems, ISO 14000, were released in 1996.  \nISO 9000 is based on a number of principles for achieving quality.  These principles \u2013 for \nexample, customer satisfaction, continual improvement and preventive action \u2013 are highly \ngeneralized allowing ISO 9000 to be readily adapted to the needs of a wide range of \norganizations, regardless of their function, ownership or size (Casper and Hancke 1999; Furusten \n2000). Applicants wishing to become certified to a chosen standard must first undergo an audit. \nAdministered by an approved third-party registrar the audit verifies whether the facility\u2019s \noperations comply with the documented procedures described in its quality management system. \n 7 \nSubject to a satisfactory inspection a certificate is issued by the registrar qualifying the \norganization to declare itself ISO 9000 accredited. Periodic surveillance audits are required to \nensure continued compliance with the standards (Mendel 2002).  \nThe business value of ISO 9000 has been extensively debated in the management \nliterature (Dick 2000; van der Wiele, Dale and Williams 2000; Stevenson and Barnes 2001). \nSupporters point to several benefits accruing to ISO 9000 certified organizations. First and \nforemost, these include external benefits of increased customer satisfaction and market share, \nfollowed by internal benefits in terms of improved operational efficiency and productivity. In \nfact, despite being conceived primarily as a tool for achieving external quality assurance, firm-\nlevel surveys reveal that the internal benefits enjoyed by certified companies are often greater \nthan external ones (Larsen and H\u00e4versj\u00f6 2000). Critics, however, have questioned the alleged \nbenefits of ISO 9000. They point to the high financial costs of certification. They also question \nwhether the standards actually contribute to improved product quality and market \ncompetitiveness. Suffice to say, while many studies find a positive correlation between \ncertification and business performance (e.g., Withers and Ebrahimpour 2000), several others find \nthat ISO 9000 has little or no impact on long-term profitability (e.g., Wayhan, Kirche and \nKhumawala 2002). Perhaps unsurprisingly, therefore, doubts persist over the efficiency of the \nstandards. \nWhat is clear, however, is that ISO 9000 has proved a spectacular success. At the end of \n2001, the end-year of our study period, more than 510,000 certificates had been issued in 161 \ncountries across the globe. Yet a striking feature of certification activity is its geographically \nuneven distribution. Europe and the Far East regions are host to the largest number of certificates \nand account for the bulk of the world\u2019s total \u2013 see table 1. On a country basis, with more than \n 8 \n66,000 certificates, the United Kingdom has the highest number of ISO 9000 certified facilities, \nfollowed by China with over 57,000. Several EU countries, Japan, the United States, Australia \nand South Korea also feature in the top 10 \u2013 see table 2. A number of rapidly industrializing \ncountries in Asia and Latin America also have comparatively high national ISO 9000 counts. \nElsewhere enthusiasm for the standards has been far lower. Iran, for example, has only 618 \ncertified facilities to its name and Bangladesh a mere 38. Relative to population size, Australia \nhas the highest number of ISO 9000 certificates, followed by the UK and various other EU \nmember states. A handful of smaller countries, including Israel and Singapore, also have high \nper capita certification counts. \n \n< Insert Tables 1 and 2 about here > \n \nThe goal of this paper is to explain these variations in national certification counts, and in \ndoing so, advance current understanding of the mechanisms and geographic preconditions \nunderpinning the uneven transfer, diffusion and convergence of organizational innovations at the \nglobal level. To achieve this, we depart from previous cross-national diffusion studies, based \nlargely on qualitative evidence drawn from a handful of nation-states. Instead, our paper takes a \nquantitative approach, and uses econometric techniques to estimate the influence of several \nhypothesized variables on certification counts for a sample of 130 countries.  \nBefore proceeding to develop our theoretically-derived hypotheses, it is important to note \nthat ISO 9000 is a very specific type of organizational practice, meaning that our findings may \nnot be fully generalizable to other ideas, practices and strategies that help to shape the geography \nof economic activity. In particular, because its content and implementation are standardized in a \n 9 \nset of written rules, we might expect ISO 9000 to be more geographically mobile than less \ncodified organizational innovations1. The central importance of customer requirements as a \nmotive for adoption (Anderson, Daly and Johnson 1999) additionally suggests that market actors \nare likely to play an unusually important role in inter- and intra-country diffusion patterns. Still, \nwe believe that our study makes a valuable contribution to the existing literature, providing more \ngeneralizable insights into the world-wide spread of new organizational practices. \n \nInsights on the diffusion of organizational innovations \n \nA number of distinct theoretical perspectives dominate the diffusion literature. Broadly speaking, \nhowever, they can be divided into two streams. The first, commonly referred to as the efficient-\nchoice approach, argues that adoption decisions are based on the performance and\/or profitability \nof innovations (Davies 1979; Rosenkopf and Abrahamson 1999). Variants of this approach \nassume different levels of information. Yet they all model decision-makers as rational, \ncalculative agents who select among alternatives according to their efficiency. \n The second set of approaches, widely associated with the new-institutionalism in \neconomic sociology, reject the idea of profitability and\/or performance as the primary motive \nbehind the adoption of innovations. Although accepting that early adoption decisions may be \ninfluenced by efficiency considerations, they argue that later adopters are characteristically \ndriven by a range of social pressures to adopt similar organizational practices. These may have \nlittle to do with enhancing economic and\/or technical performance, but rather, maintenance of \nexternal legitimacy. \n                                                 \n1\n The growing trend towards standardization of product and process requirements (e.g., see Sturgeon 2003), \n 10 \nIn a seminal piece, DiMaggio and Powell (1983) describe three such social pressures \u2013 \ncoercive, mimetic and normative \u2013 which shape the demand for innovations and produce \norganizational convergence. Coercive pressures operate where firms are \u2018\u2026compelled or \nmandated through regulation or exchange\u2019 (Mendel 2002, p48) to conform to specific practices. \nMimetic isomorphism arises where organizations imitate the behavior of others (Haveman 1993; \nRosenkopf and Abrahamson 1999). While normative pressures refer to the influence of \nprofessionals who define norms of rational action, and prescribe \u201cbest practice\u201d solutions \n(Galaskiewicz and Wasserman 1989; Abrahamson 1996).   \nInstitutionalist, inefficient-choice approaches dominate the recent literature on the \ndiffusion of organizational practices. In fact, in the only previous study to investigate the global \nspread of ISO 9000, Guler, Guill\u00e9n and Macpherson (2002) develop a new-institutionalist \nframework to model cross-national transfers. Underpinning the choice of neo-institutionalist \napproaches is the observation that the economic returns from organizational innovation are often \nambiguous. Hence, the emphasis on norms, rhetorics and ideologies of \u201cbest practice\u201d, which are \nassumed to shape adoption decisions under conditions of complexity and uncertainty (DiMaggio \nand Powell 1983).  \nWe agree that institutional pressures are likely to play a leading role in the diffusion of \nISO 9000. Besides, their influence has been convincingly documented in a number of recent \nqualitative and quantitative contributions examining the diffusion of organizational innovations, \nboth within and across nation-states (Zbaracki 1998; Guler, Guill\u00e9n and Macpherson 2002; \nNelson and Gopalan 2003). Yet, we argue that institutionalist approaches are \u201cunderrationalized\u201d \n(Strang and Macy 2001, p156), and that economic considerations are likely to shape the decision \nto adopt quality management standards. Indeed, recent research appears to support this \n                                                                                                                                                             \nhowever, suggests that the findings of the present paper are of wider relevance. \n 11 \ninterpretation, suggesting that both institutional and efficiency motives may explain diffusion \nprocesses involving organizational innovations (Mansfield 1993; Hislop, Newell, Scarborough \nand Swan 1997; Kogut and Parkinson 1998). \nOur analytic framework, therefore, not only recognizes a central role for institutionalized \nnorms, expectations and rules in explaining diffusion patterns. It is also open to the possibility \nthat efficiency might influence adoption decisions. Put simply, while managers can be induced, \ncoerced or regulated to adopt ISO 9000, the extent to which they are receptive to these pressures \nwill partly be a function of profitability. Of course, this does not mean that mangers are fully \nrational, always optimizing agents. They are not (Dicken and Malmberg 2001). Yet it would be \nsurprising if geographic factors influencing efficiency \u2013 or indeed the supply of information \nabout profitability and\/or performance \u2013 did not affect adoption rates. \nCombining these perspectives \u2013 economic and new-institutionalist \u2013 the following sub-\nsections outline a series of hypotheses about the conditions promoting and\/or inhibiting ISO \ncertification where the unit of analysis is the nation-state. Our hypotheses are divided into two \nbroad categories. The first are concerned with transnational network ties which connect \ngeographically dispersed territories, firms and managers, and provide a conduit for the \ninternational transfer of organizational innovations. While the second set of hypotheses are \nprimarily concerned with country-level environmental conditions influencing the receptiveness \nof firms to new organizational practices.  \n \n 12 \n \n(a) Transnational network ties \nNetworks have received growing attention from economic geographers over the past decade. \nUnderlying this interest is recognition that firms are embedded in a complex set of relational \nnetworks linking customers, suppliers, and a host of governmental and non-governmental \norganizations. Networks create opportunities for interaction, learning and influence, and \ntherefore are seen as providing a central context for the production, shaping and transfer of new \nideas, knowledge and practices (Gertler 2001; Bathelt and Gl\u00fcckler 2003). Much of the focus of \nrecent work in geography, of course, has been on relational networks at the sub-national level, \nand specifically, between actors within city-regions (e.g., Florida 1995; Morgan 1997; Keeble \nand Wilkinson 1999; Benner 2003). Yet there is growing awareness that interactions through \nnetworks at the international level also shape patterns of geo-corporate behavior (Amin and \nThrift 1992; Clark, Mansfield and Tickell 2001; Coe and Yeung 2001; Dicken and Malmberg \n2001; Sturgeon 2003).  \nOne of the most important transnational networks is created by international trade. \nAlthough primarily associated with the exchange of goods and services there are two reasons \nwhy we might expect trade flows to influence the cross-national transfer of organizational \ninnovations. First, networks of trade connect customers in one country with suppliers in another, \nand provide a channel for the transmission of coercive supply-chain pressures (Coe and Yeung \n2001; Smith 2003). Acting through value chains, Porter (1990) describes how sophisticated and \ndemanding buyers in home markets can act as catalysts for improvements in the product quality, \nproductivity and competitiveness of domestic firms. The exercise of coercive power by \ninfluential buyers, and its influence on organizational behavior, has also been observed at the \n 13 \ncross-national level. Thus, Hughes (2000) documents how Kenyan floricultural suppliers are \nrequired to meet strict requirements regarding production processes, quality, etc., set by major \nretail multiples in the UK. Anecdotal evidence suggests that similar supply-chain pressures have \nbeen a significant factor in the take-up of ISO 9000. Many certified firms, and especially large \nand\/or multinational ones, routinely specify ISO 9000 as a contractual condition of supply \n(Casper and Hancke 1999). Hence, for firms exporting a large share of their output, significant \nincentives exist to adopt the standards. No doubt this explains the results of firm-level surveys \nsuggesting that \u201cmarket access\u201d and \u201ccustomer requirements\u201d are lead motives for certification \nactivity (Vloeberghs 1996; Buttle 1997; Ebrahimpour, Withers and Hikmet 1997; Chittenden, \nPoutziouris and Mukhta 1998). \n A second way in which trade might influences the cross-national pattern of organizational \npractice is by increasing the frequency of formal and informal interactions between actors \nlocated in different countries (c.f. Granovetter 1973). These interactions provide opportunities \nfor cross-national learning about the technical performance and\/or profitability of specific \norganizational innovations (Gertler 2001). They also support mimetic-type behavior whereby \norganizations imitate the practices of others they perceive as especially legitimate and\/or \nsuccessful (DiMaggio and Powell 1983). Through trade-based interactions, firms may learn \nfrom, and moreover, emulate, the practices of their high-reputation foreign counterparts (Arias \nand Guill\u00e9n 1998). \n Taken jointly, these arguments strongly suggest that countries which export a higher \nshare of their output to markets with high numbers of ISO 9000 certificates will themselves have \nmore certificates. One key market in this respect is the EU. Member states such as Sweden, \nFrance and Germany were early adopters of ISO 9000 and have since gone on to diffuse the \n 14 \nstandards throughout their economic structure. The result is that, despite accounting for a mere 5 \nper cent of the world\u2019s population, the EU 152 was host to nearly half of the global number of \nISO 9000 certificates in 2001. Given its popularity, we expect firms exporting to the EU to be \nmore likely to learn about ISO 9000 and, furthermore, influenced to adopt ISO 9000 as a model \nof \u201cbest practice.\u201d More importantly, perhaps, exporters are likely to face strong demand-side \npressures to adopt ISO 9000 from EU customers. Indeed, according to several observers, the \nformal adoption of conformity assessment procedures by the European Commission in 1989, \nenabling EU firms \u2018\u2026to reject products or services from companies that are not registered with \nthe ISO\u2019 (Withers and Ebrahimpour 2000, p596), made ISO 9000 a de facto standard for firms \nwishing to access the European market (Tanner 1998; Mendel 2002). This interpretation is \nconsistent with Corbett (2002) who finds that supply-chain pressures by early adopters in Europe \nplayed an important role in the transfer and diffusion of ISO 9000 to later adopters in other \ncountries and regions. Hence:  \n \nHypothesis 1. Countries which export a larger share of their goods and services to the EU are \nlikely to have more ISO 9000 certificates.  \n  \n Transnational production networks, centered on and around transnational corporations \n(TNCs) and their subsidiaries, comprise another business network supporting the diffusion of \norganizational innovations at the global level. Gertler (2001, p11), for example, asserts that, \n\u2018\u2026foreign direct investment (FDI) constitutes arguably the most active channel available to \nfirms to promote the circulation of new practices.\u2019 Supporting such claims is a substantial body \nof work that documents how transnationals have been instrumental in the transfer, adoption and \n                                                 \n2\n The EU 15 prior to the accession of the 10 new member states in May 2004. \n 15 \ndiffusion of new technologies, knowledge and organizational practices in host economies \n(Florida and Kenney 1992; Li and Yeung 1999; Potter, Moore and Spires 2002; Hayter and \nEdington 2004). \nThis work suggests that TNCs accelerate the cross-national transfer and within-country \ndiffusion of new organizational innovations in two ways. First, they contribute to the uptake of \nnew practices directly, deploying \u201cstandardized\u201d organizational procedures, structures and \nstrategies throughout their regional and\/or global network of operations. Clark, Mansfield and \nTickell (2001), for example, describe how a growing number of German TNCs are implementing \ncommon accounting standards, both in their domestic and overseas operations. A similar process \nmay account, in part, for the global spread of ISO 9000. Reports indicate that many large TNCs \nhave adopted ISO 9000. Moreover, they are adopting the standards on a corporate-wide basis, \nsince ISO 9000 offers a flexible and widely-accepted system of quality management and \nassurance (Yahya and Goh 2001; Mizuno 2002). \nA second way in which TNCs influence the spread of new organizational practices is by \nacting as a catalyst for adoption by domestic firms. As influential, and potentially demanding, \nbuyers of goods and services (Porter 1990; Potter, Moore and Spires 2002; Hayter and Edington \n2004), transnationals can prompt uptake directly, compelling local suppliers to meet specific \nprocedural standards. For example, Ivarsson and Alvstam (2004), describe how, as a qualifying \ncriterion, Volvo\u2019s components suppliers are required to meet specific standards regarding, \namongst other, internal quality systems. Given that TNCs have been at the forefront of adopting \nISO 9000, we expect similar requirements to have driven certification activity amongst upstream \nsuppliers. \n 16 \nTNCs might also stimulate certification among domestic firms by acting as normative \nmodels of \u201cbest practice\u201d. Transnationals\u2019 size, observability and profitability mean that they are \nmore likely to be seen as legitimate and\/or successful (Haveman 1993). Managers of domestic \nfirms may imitate ISO 9000 certification by TNCs, therefore, in order to associate themselves \nwith the strategic choices of these high-reputation counterparts (Abrahamson 1996). Similarly, \ninteracting with local TNC affiliates and\/or subsidiaries, domestic firms may learn about the \nexistence and\/or benefits of ISO 9000. Supporting this idea, Potter, Moore and Spires (2002) find \nthat the informal sharing of ideas, views and information is a central mechanism through which \nnew practices have diffused from foreign investors to domestic firms in the UK manufacturing \nsector. \n Through these processes, therefore, the local involvement of transnationals is likely to be \nconducive to the diffusion of ISO 9000. Indeed, previous cross-country evidence corroborates \nthis thesis, finding a positive statistical relationship between certification of both ISO 9000 and \nISO 14001 and inward investment by TNCs (Guler, Guill\u00e9n and Macpherson 2002; Neumayer \nand Perkins 2004). Hence:  \n \nHypothesis 2. Countries with more inward investments by TNCs are likely to have a higher \nnumber of ISO 9000 certificates.  \n \nOf course, it is not only contemporary linkages that potentially influence patterns of \ndiffusion, but also historical ones. Arias and Guill\u00e9n (1998, p115) note that historical \ninterdependencies have largely been overlooked in the existing literature on cross-national \ndiffusion. Yet, given the durable nature of economic, social and political institutions (Gertler \n 17 \n1995), there are sound reasons to suppose that they will continue to influence the transfer of \norganizational innovations across national borders. \nParticularly significant in this respect is colonialism, experienced by all but a handful of \ntoday\u2019s developing economies. Although the majority of colonies have since gained \nindependence there is plenty of evidence to suggest that they continue to enjoy close economic, \npolitical and social ties with former colonial powers. Neumayer (2003), for instance, \ndemonstrates that patterns of bi-lateral aid remain heavily influenced by former colonial \nlinkages. These and other ties are likely to prove important channels for organizational diffusion \nacross national boundaries, particularly from developed to developing countries, reflecting the \nunequal power relations \u2018\u2026between colonizer and colonized, dominator and dominated in the \nworld system\u2019 (Frenkel and Shenhav 2003, p1541). Arias and Guill\u00e9n (1998), for example, \ndescribe how the exchange of students, managers and professionals as part of bi-lateral aid \nschemes during the post war-period, led to the transfer of economic practices from Europe and \nthe US to developing countries. \nApplied in the present context, these insights suggest that we should expect ex-colonies \nof developed economies with high numbers of ISO 9000 certified facilities to have a higher \nnumber of certificates. In practice, this points to former colonies of EU member states, and \nespecially ones which were under colonial control for a prolonged period of time. As shown in \ntable 1, the European region is host to over half of the world\u2019s ISO 9000 certificates, and \nmoreover, was a pioneer in early diffusion of the standards. Therefore, we expect: \n \nHypothesis 3. Countries which spent a longer period under European colonial rule are likely to \nhave a higher number of ISO 9000 certificates.  \n 18 \n \nAt a more general level we expect the cross-national transfer and diffusion of new \norganizational innovations to be influenced by the extent to which social actors in one country \ncommunicate with their counterparts in others. Empirical work has shown that early adopters are \ncharacteristically more cosmopolitan than late adopters (Rogers 1995). By interacting with a \nwider range of actors outside their immediate social system cosmopolitan actors are more likely \nto be exposed to informational and\/or social influences promoting adoption (O'Neill, Pouder and \nBuchholtz 1998). Extending these insights to cross-national diffusion processes involving \norganizational innovations suggests that the transfer and adoption of ISO 9000 will be shaped by \nthe availability of cross-country communications media. Access to telephones, faxes, the \ninternet, etc., increases the likelihood of interactions between adopters and potential adopters in \ndifferent nation-states, and therefore, distanciated learning (Guill\u00e9n 2001; Amin and Cohendet \n2004). Indeed, given that there are no internationally-recognized substitutes to ISO 9000, we \nexpect generic communications channels to assume particular importance in the worldwide \nspread of the standards:  \n \nHypothesis 4. Countries with a greater availability of telecommunications media are likely to \nhave a higher number of ISO 9000 certificates.  \n \n(b) Characteristics of the national environment \nOrganizational innovations not only diffuse between nation-states but also within them (True and \nMintrom 2001). As well as transnational networks, therefore, we expect the characteristics of the \nnational environment to influence their geographic spread. Of particular importance in this \n 19 \nrespect is the state. Despite the popular image of policies, practices and strategies being imposed \nfrom above by global actors, there is growing recognition that the state retains considerable \ninfluence in shaping the trajectory of organizational convergence (Argent 2002; Park 2003). The \nstate can resist homogenizing pressures by, for example, mandating compliance with national (as \nopposed to international) standards of organizational practice. Alternatively, it can actively \nsupport the import and diffusion of foreign practices by, for instance, providing relevant \ninformation, training and financial support to potential adopters (Arias and Guill\u00e9n 1998). The \navailable literature strongly supports the idea that the state has had a major influence in the \ncontext of ISO 9000. Driven by the belief that ISO 9000 certification can enhance industrial \ncompetitiveness, governments have encouraged take-up of the standards. In this capacity, they \nhave offered firms technical and\/or financial assistance, primarily to lower the economic costs of \nimplementation and registration (Mizuno 2002). They have also advanced ISO 9000 as a model \nof \u201cbest practice\u201d using promotional material \u2013 brochures, seminars, etc. \u2013 highlighting \u201csuccess \nstories\u201d of efficient adoptions (Mendel 2002).  \n State actors have also created coercive pressures for certification. This process began in \n1989 when the EU took the pioneering decision to incorporate ISO 9000 into its \u201cGlobal \nApproach to Testing and Certification\u201d, and subsequent \u201cNew Approach Directives\u201d. By \npermitting manufacturers to meet conformity requirements using ISO 9000, the Commission \nprovided a powerful incentive for certification among European firms, as well as their suppliers \n(Mallak, Bringelson and Lyth 1997; Anderson, Daly and Johnson 1999; McCalman, Wilkinson \nand Brouthers 2000). Evidence suggests that governments in other countries have since gone on \nto list the standards in their conformity assessment procedures. A growing number have also \nincorporated ISO 9000 into public-sector procurement guidelines (Beattie and Sohal 1999). For \n 20 \nthese reasons, we anticipate that countries whose governments are more involved in the economy \nin terms of government consumption, governmental production of goods and services, and \ngovernment ownership of production facilities, will have a higher certification count. Hence:  \n \nHypothesis 5. Countries with high levels of government involvement in the economy are likely to \nhave more ISO 9000 certificates. \n \nYet the state\u2019s influence on the diffusion of new organizational innovations is potentially \nambiguous. While governments can provide positive incentives to \u201cdownload\u201d and diffuse new \npractices through, for example, procurement specifications, they can also indirectly deter their \nuptake. Thus, where government intervention negatively impacts financial returns \u2013 for instance, \nbecause firms are subject to an elaborate, complicated and burdensome regulatory process \u2013 \norganizations are unlikely to make significant, long-term investments. The same is to be \nexpected where governments increase investment uncertainty through the uneven application of \nregulations and\/or corruption. Conversely, where the regulatory burden on firms is \ncomparatively low and\/or regulations are applied in a uniform way, firms are more likely to \nmake large investments in new organizational practices. This includes ISO 9000 which involves \na substantial up-investment, and moreover, one whose returns are likely to be realized over the \nlonger-term (Bier\u00e3o and Sarsfield Cabral 2002). Hence: \n \nHypothesis 6. Countries with a lower regulatory burden imposed on the private economy are \nlikely to be hosts to a larger number of ISO 9000 certificates.  \n \n 21 \nMore generally, by influencing the real and\/or anticipated financial returns from \nefficiency-enhancing organizational practices, we expect productivity levels to impact \ncertification activity. Although market requirements routinely emerge as the lead motive for ISO \n9000, surveys reveal that \u201cproductivity\u201d and \u201cefficiency\u201d are significant reasons for seeking \ncertification (Buttle 1997). Productivity motives are likely to be especially important among \norganizations characterized by low levels of productivity. Such organizations are unlikely to \nhave exploited many low-cost, high-return investments in operational efficiency. Consequently, \nwe predict that they will earn a higher financial return from ISO 9000, which is well-suited to \nidentifying and realizing productivity-enhancing investment opportunities: \n \nHypothesis 7. Countries with lower levels of productivity are likely to have a higher number of \nISO 9000 certificates. \n \nOrganizational resources are another factor known to influence the adoption of new \npractices (Florida, Atlas and Cline 2001). These include, of particular significance, human \ncapital. Firms with better-educated workforces are not only more likely to have knowledge of \nnew organizational practices, but are likely to find it cheaper to implement them. As noted \nabove, the procedural requirements of ISO 9000 are extensive, particularly in terms of planning, \nmonitoring and documentation. Hence, we anticipate the profitability of ISO 9000 to be sensitive \nto educational levels, with poorly educated workforces finding it especially difficult and costly to \nachieve certification:   \n \n 22 \nHypothesis 8. Countries with higher education levels are likely to have a higher number of ISO \n9000 certificates. \n \nThe receptiveness of firms to specific organizational practices, strategies and standards is \nalso likely to depend on their economic sector. Certain innovations will clearly be of greater \nvalue to organizations in some economic sectors than others. ISO 9000, for example, is likely to \nbe of most benefit to manufacturing firms. The importance of quality to the safety, reliability, \netc., of their output means that manufacturers are often subject to coercive pressures from \nupstream buyers. Markets for many manufacturing goods, and especially standardized and\/or \ninternationally-traded ones, are also highly price competitive. As a result, manufacturing firms \nface especially strong pressures to cut costs, providing an additional motive for adopting \nefficiency-enhancing organizational practices. This is likely to favor ISO 9000 which, in addition \nto improving product quality, is well-suited to identifying and realizing cost-savings through \noperational improvements (Larsen and H\u00e4versj\u00f6 2000). Together, this suggests that ISO counts \nwill be higher in manufacturing-based economies, a predication supported by reports suggesting \nthat certification activity has proceeded most rapidly in the industrial sector (Chittenden, \nPoutziouris and Mukhta 1998; Acharya and Ray 2000; Brown 2004): \n \nHypothesis 9. Countries with a greater share of manufacturing in GDP are likely to have more \nISO 9000 certificates. \n \n \n 23 \nResearch Design \n \nOur dependent variable is the number of ISO 9000 certified facilities at the national level (ISO \n2001, 2002) normalized by population size in order to make counts comparable across different-\nsized countries (ISO9000PC). National ISO certification counts are available from 1993 \nonwards. We lose the first year due to the inclusion of the lagged dependent variable in the \nregressions. Moreover, since 1993 and 1994 data refer to mid- rather than end-of-year, we \nrestrict our sample to the period 1995-2001, all of which refer to end-year counts.3 Data for ISO \n9000 are available for 2002, but many of our explanatory variables are not, with the result that \nwe are forced to omit this year from the analysis.   \nTo test the influence of transnational network ties on national certification counts we use \nfour explanatory variables. The first is the value of exports of goods and services to the then 15 \nEU member states relative to the exporting country\u2019s gross domestic product (EU15EXPGDP). \nFor EU countries, this variable refers to exports to the other 14 EU states. These data are taken \nfrom OECD (2003). The second variable is the stock of FDI relative to GDP (FDISTOCKGDP) \nas reported by UNCTAD (2003). FDI stock is a better measure of the overall level of TNC \ninvolvement in host economies than potentially volatile annual FDI inflows and therefore is \nwell-suited to testing our research hypothesis. Our third explanatory variable measures the \nnumber of years a developing country has been under European colonial rule between 1900 and \n1960 (COLONY) as documented by Alesina and Dollar (2000). And fourth, we use the number \n                                                 \n3\n For the year 1995, we include the lagged value of the dependent variable from mid-1994, however, in order to \navoid a further reduction in sample size. \n 24 \nof main telephone lines per 100 inhabitants (TELEPHONESPC) as a proxy for the availability of \ntelecommunications, with data taken from ITU (2003). \nCharacteristics of the national environment are captured by a set of five variables. First, \nwe use a sub-component of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s (2003) Index of Economic Freedom, \nwhich ranks countries on a one-to-five scale according to general government involvement in the \neconomy (GOVINVOLVEMENT). Countries are graded with respect to: (a) the level of \ngovernment consumption as a percentage of the economy; (b) the extent of government \nownership of businesses and industries; (c) the share of government revenues from state-owned \nenterprises; (d) government ownership of property; and (e) economic output produced by the \ngovernment. Higher values imply greater government involvement. Whilst this variable \nmeasures general government involvement, another sub-component of the Index of Economic \nFreedom provides a measure of the regulatory burden imposed on private businesses \n(REGBURDEN), again ranked on a one-to-five scale. A country is rated one if existing \nregulations are straightforward and applied uniformly to all businesses and corruption is nearly \nnonexistent. While, at the other end of the scale, a rating of five is reserved for countries where \nthe government impedes the creation of new businesses, corruption is rampant and regulations \nare applied randomly. \nThe third variable in this group uses gross secondary school enrolment ratio as a proxy \nfor the national level of education (%SECONDEDUCATION). These data are taken from World \nBank (2003) and UNESCO (2003). Ideally, we would have liked to use a variable that measured \nthe educational status of the workforce directly. However, the only measure fitting this \ndescription has very poor cross-country availability, meaning that we resort to secondary school \nenrolment. The manufacturing share of GDP (%MANUFACT), the fourth variable, is taken from \n 25 \nWorld Bank (2003) and is complemented by data provided by CIA (2002). For our measure of \neconomic productivity we use GDP in purchasing power parity (PPP) divided by the size of the \nlabor force (GDPPERWORKER). All data are from World Bank (2003). \nFinally, as an additional control variable, we include total GDP in PPP (GDP). In the \nabsence of data on the number of facilities in a country, we realistically assume that the number \nof potential adopters is a functional of total economic size. Countries with more facilities are also \nmore likely to host innovative, early-adopters who experiment with ISO 9000 and subsequently \ninfluence others to adopt the standards (Rogers 1995). Table 3 provides summary descriptive \nvariable information. One might be concerned about potential multicollinearity problems. \nHowever, variance inflation factors were computed and did not suggest reason for concern (the \naverage factor is only 2.91). \n \n< Insert Table 3 about here > \n \nWe estimate the following model: \n \nlnyit = \u03b1 + \u03b21lnyit-1 + \u03b22xit + \u03b3tTt + vit. \n \nThe subscript i represents each country in year t, y is the number of ISO 9000 certifications and x \nis the vector of explanatory variables. The dependent variable is logged in order to reduce \nheteroscedasticity and render its distribution less skewed. To do so, we are forced to add one to \nthe absolute number of ISO 9000 counts, since the log of zero is undefined. As concerns the \nexplanatory variables, we had to take the log of the total GDP variable. Its distribution is \n 26 \nextremely skewed and its relation to ISO 9000 counts is log-linear, suggesting that the number of \ncertifiable firms increases with total economic size, but at a decreasing rate.4 The year-specific \ndummy variables T capture general developments such as rising worldwide levels of awareness \nabout the standards and correct for unobserved time effects. The vit is a stochastic error term. We \nestimate equation (1) with Beck and Katz\u2019s (1995) popular and commonly applied time-series \ncross-sectional estimator with panel-corrected standard errors. The error term is presumed to be \nheteroskedastic and contemporaneously correlated across countries. Beck and Katz (1995) \nprovide Monte Carlo evidence that this estimator typically produces more conservative estimates \nof standard errors than the alternative estimator, feasible generalized least squares (FGLS). The \ntime dimension is somewhat shorter than in typical applications of Beck and Katz\u2019s estimator. \nHowever, employing a random-effects estimator instead leads to practically identical results.5 \nThe use of a lagged dependent variable has several advantages. First, and most \nimportantly, it allows us to control for self-reinforcing diffusion dynamics, whereby the number \nof previous adoptions positively influences subsequent ones (Rosenkopf and Abrahamson 1999). \nSuch dynamics are well-documented (Guler, Guill\u00e9n and Macpherson 2002; Neumayer and \nPerkins 2004; Perkins and Neumayer 2004a) and are likely to have a major impact on the \ngeographic pattern of ISO 9000 certification. Second, by using a lagged dependent variable, we \nare able to substantially reduce any autocorrelation. And third, the lagged dependent variable is \ncorrelated with potentially omitted variables. No econometric model is ever complete and several \npotential determinants of ISO 9000 certification are difficult to capture. Inclusion of the lagged \n                                                 \n4\n If not entered in logged form, total GDP would be negative and significant, which makes no sense. \n5\n Unfortunately, we cannot employ a fixed-effects estimator since there simply is not enough over-time variation in \nthe data. The major variation is cross-sectional. \n 27 \ndependent variable thus tends to mitigate potential omitted variable bias (Finkel 1995). We have \ndata available for a large panel of 130 countries. Table 4 lists the countries included in the \nsample. \n \n< Insert Table 4 about here > \n \nResults \n \nTable 5 presents our estimation results. As expected, the lagged dependent variable is positive \nand highly statistically significant, the inclusion of which also accounts for the high R-squared \nvalue. That is, our estimations suggest that the number of past ISO 9000 adoptions has a major \nimpact on subsequent certification activity, a finding consistent with the idea that patterns of \ngeo-corporate change are cumulative and path-dependent (Coe and Yeung 2001; Bathelt and \nGl\u00fcckler 2003). Although our results say nothing about the underlying drivers of this \nrelationship, it is most likely the product of bandwagon-type dynamics. Thus, a larger user base \nwill most likely enhance the supply of information about ISO 9000, increasing the probability of \nnon-adopters learning about the standards. While accumulated experience of ISO 9000 is likely \nto reduce the implementation costs for late-adopters, raising the profitability of the standards, \nand the economic incentive to certify. Similarly, coercive pressures to adopt ISO 9000 are likely \nto grow with the number of certificates, as a growing population of certified firms place \ncontractual requirements on their domestic suppliers.  \nStill, the estimated coefficient of the lagged dependent variable is below one, suggesting \nthat the spread of ISO 9000 is not simply driven by self-reinforcing bandwagon dynamics. Other \n 28 \nfactors are clearly important in the geographic pattern of ISO 9000 certification. One is the size \nof the economy. We estimate that larger economies, as measured by GDP, have more ISO 9000 \ncertified facilities. Given that bigger economies are likely to have a greater number of potential \nadopters of quality management systems than smaller ones this result makes sense. \nOur econometric estimations also strongly support the idea that transnational network ties \nhave influenced the uneven transfer and diffusion of ISO 9000 at the global level. As anticipated, \nexports to the EU 15 (EU15EXPGDP) and the FDI stock (FDISTOCKGDP) are found to be \npositively and statistically significantly correlated with national ISO 9000 counts. Stated \ndifferently, countries more integrated into the global economy \u2013 via international trade and \ninvestment \u2013 are likely to have more certified facilities. These results are broadly consistent with \nGuler, Guill\u00e9n and Macpherson (2002), who similarly estimate that trade and investment patterns \ninfluence the geography of certification, but derive from a more globally-representative sample \nof 130 countries.  \nOur econometric estimations do not tell us why European export-orientation and \nexposure to international investment encourages firms to adopt ISO 9000. Yet, based on the \navailable case-study evidence, we suspect two underlying drivers. The first, and most important, \nis coercion. Contractual requirements imposed by business customers are likely to have provided \na major impetus for certification. As noted above, many large TNCs have adopted ISO 9000, and \nmoreover, are requiring their suppliers to certify to the standards. Hence it makes sense that \ncountries with a larger stock of FDI should have more ISO 9000 certificates. Similarly, the high \nnumber of ISO 9000 compliant firms, together with the formal incorporation of the standards \ninto the EU\u2019s conformity assessment procedures, strongly suggests that exporters to member \nstates are likely to face strong pressures to certify to ISO 9000. These market-based pressures \n 29 \nmost likely explain the higher number of certificates in countries that export a higher share of \ntheir output to the EU. \nA second set of drivers potentially explaining the influence of export ties and inward \ndirect investment are informational and ideational in nature. Interacting with ISO 9000 certified \nbuyers in the EU, and\/or certified TNCs in host economies, managers are likely to learn about \nthe existence, benefits and\/or profitability of the standards, potentially stimulating certification \nactivity (Gertler 2001; Guler, Guill\u00e9n and Macpherson 2002). Alternatively, domestic managers \nmay mimic their EU and\/or multinational counterparts with whom they interact, adopting ISO \n9000 in order to align themselves with externally-defined norms of \u201cbest practice\u201d (Abrahamson \n1996). Previous case-study research suggests that these mechanisms are important vehicles for \nthe diffusion of new ideas, knowledge and practices (Hughes 2000; Potter, Moore and Spires \n2002) and there is little to suggest that they have not also been influential in the geographical \nspread of ISO 9000.  \nProviding further empirical support for the assumed importance of transnational networks \nin the global diffusion of new organizational practices we find that telecommunications and \ncolonial linkages influence the pattern of ISO 9000 certification. Per capita availability of \ntelephones (TELEPHONESPC) and the length of time a country has been under European \ncolonial rule are both positive correlates of certification counts (COLONY). Again, our \nestimations do not allow us to draw definitive conclusions about underlying mechanisms, \nalthough the results are intuitively plausible. Telecommunications provide an opportunity for \npotential adopters to learn about organizational practices from adopters in other countries. It is \nhardly surprising, therefore, that countries with a higher density of telephones have more ISO \n9000 certificates. The relationship between certification activity and former European colonial \n 30 \nstatus is equally plausible. Europe has led in the adoption of ISO 9000, driven, in large part, by \nthe decision by the EU to incorporate the standard into its conformity procedures. Ongoing, and \noften close, ties between European states and their former colonies are likely to facilitate the \ntransfer of information, norms, etc., regarding the standards, stimulating certification activity in \ndeveloping countries. \nConsistent with our predications, and moving beyond the determinants hypothesized by \nGuler, Guill\u00e9n and Macpherson (2002), we additionally find that characteristics of the national \nenvironment influence patterns of organizational diffusion. In particular, we estimate a positive \nand statistically significant relationship between national ISO 9000 counts, enrolment rates in \nsecondary education (%SECONDEDUCATION) and share of manufacturing in GDP \n(%MANUFACT); and a negative significant relationship between national ISO 9000 counts, \nregulatory burden (REGBURDEN) and economic productivity (ln GDPPERWORKER). Drawing \ncausal inferences from these statistical relationships is problematic. However, given that all four \nfactors potentially influence the profitability of certification, we suspect that economic \nconsiderations predominate. \nThus, not only are firms with better-educated workers more likely to be aware of the \nexistence of ISO 9000 through, for example, their links with professional associations. More \nimportantly, perhaps, they are likely to find implementing a documented quality management \nsystem less costly than their counterparts in countries with a poorly-educated workforce. The \nnegative relationship between productivity and certification is also most likely rooted in the \neconomic returns from adoption. Quality management systems are well-suited to identifying and \nrealizing low-cost, high-return operational improvements. However, because firms in more \nproductive countries will have exploited many of these gains, it makes sense that the potential \n 31 \neconomic returns, and hence, willingness of firms to invest in ISO 9000, will be lower under \nconditions of high productivity. \nThe economic incentive to adopt ISO 9000 is also likely to be impacted by the style of \nbusiness regulation. Burdensome, erratic and\/or corrupt regulatory interventions by governments \nreduce the economic incentive to make costly, long-term investments. Therefore, it is hardly \nsurprising that they should act as a deterrent to adopting ISO 9000, whose set-up costs are high \nand financial returns only realized over the longer-term. Differences in the financial returns from \ncertification may additionally explain why countries with a higher share of manufacturing in \nGDP have more ISO 9000 certificates. Manufacturing firms are more likely to benefit from cost \nsavings through implementing a quality management systems \u2013 via, for example, reduced \nmaterials usage \u2013 than firms in, say, the financial sector. These offsetting benefits might be \nexpected to increase the willingness of profit-seeking managers to absorb the costs of \nimplementing and certifying ISO 9000. Reinforcing these incentives are supply-chain pressures \nwhich are known to be most advanced in the manufacturing sector. \nOne surprising result is the statistically insignificant and negative coefficient for \nGOVINT. This contradicts our hypothesis which suggested that countries with higher levels of \ngovernment consumption are likely to have more ISO 9000 certificates. It is also counter to \nGuler, Guill\u00e9n and Macpherson (2002) who estimate a positive and statistically significant \nrelationship between ISO 9000 counts and government consumption. What explains this \napparent disparity? One possible answer is our larger sample of countries. Data limitations mean \nthat Guler, Guill\u00e9n and Macpherson (2002) are forced to omit a large number of, presumably, \ndeveloping countries from their sample. Although consuming a substantial share of GDP there is \nlittle evidence to suggest that governments of low-income countries have driven ISO 9000 \n 32 \ncertification through procurement and conformity requirements. Therefore, while governments \nmay well have driven certification in a number of developed countries, their overall influence at \nthe global level is comparatively small.  \n \n< Insert Table 5 about here > \n \n \n \nDiscussion and conclusions \n \nAccording to Bryson (2000, p157-158), \u2018Central to the geography of economic activity should be \nan understanding of the transfer of management ideas and techniques into and between \ncompanies.\u2019 This paper investigates the mechanisms and geographic preconditions underpinning \nsuch transfers at the global level. Using panel data for 130 countries, we use econometric \ntechniques to estimate the influence of several hypothesized variables on adoption of ISO 9000, \nthe internationally-recognized series of quality management standards. \nA particular advantage of our quantitative approach is that it allows us to identify generic \nfacilitators and\/or barriers involved in the diffusion process. Previous geographical work has \ndone a poor job in this respect. Drawing on case-study evidence from a small number of \neconomies, researchers have principally been concerned with identifying country-specific socio-\ninstitutional characteristics that account for the acceptance or, more often, rejection of \n\u201cimported\u201d organizational innovations (e.g., Christopherson 2002; Argent 2002). The present \npaper has sought to move beyond this focus on national specificity by performing a much-needed \n 33 \nsystematic analysis of organizational diffusion across a large number of developed and \ndeveloping countries. Of course, our large-sample, econometric approach is constrained by the \navailability of measurable proxies and, moreover, cannot provide the kind of contextual detail \nafforded by previous small-sample, qualitative studies. Nevertheless, it usefully complements \nthese approaches, although we wish to stress that our quantitative methodology is in no way \nsuperior.  \nOur results advance current understanding of the mechanisms and geographic \npreconditions underlying the cross-national transfer and within-country diffusion of new \norganizational innovations in several ways. First, they confirm the role of networks, and \nspecifically, transnational networks, in the international spread of organizational practices \n(Hughes 2000; Dicken and Malmberg 2001; Gertler 2001; Smith 2003; Sturgeon 2003). They \nsuggest that relational networks linking actors in different nation-states function as conduits for \nthe transfer of information, norms and coercive pressures and, in doing so, provide a central \ncontext for cross-national diffusion of new organizational innovations. The importance of \nnetworks, of course, is hardly new to economic geographers. However, while the predominant \nfocus of recent work has been on interaction, learning and influence through social networks at \nthe sub-national level (e.g., Benner 2003), our work points to the possibility of similar processes \noperating through networks at the international one.  \nThis is not to say that the domestic context is irrelevant. To the extent that the single most \nimportant determinant of national certification counts is the pre-existing number of ISO 9000 \ncertificates, the results of our analysis suggest that domestic learning and influence are \nparamount. Despite the supposed primacy of global forces, patterns of geo-corporate change \nremain cumulative, path-dependent and predominantly local (Gertler 1995; Coe and Yeung \n 34 \n2001; Bathelt and Gl\u00fcckler 2003). Still, the fact that telecommunications, export ties, and \ncolonial ties all emerge as statistically significant determinants of national certification counts, \nstrongly indicates that distanciated learning and influence are real (Amin and Cohendet 2004).  \nThe findings of this paper therefore suggest that proponents of the learning region \napproach (e.g., Morgan 1997) are right to highlight the central importance of geographic \nproximity in organizational learning. Yet, by neglecting global ties, they risk under-spatializing \nthe sources of geo-corporate change. Our study points to the need for a multi-scalar perspective, \none that recognizes that learning and influence operate on a variety of scales, from local to global \n(Coe and Yeung 2001; Sturgeon 2003). \nOur paper also reinforces the importance of the spatial configuration of networks in the \nuneven diffusion of organizational practices. Transnational networks are not ubiquitous. Rather, \nas Cox and Yeung (2001, p375) remind us, \u2018\u2026they are highly uneven and embedded in specific \nplaces.\u2019 Our econometric estimations suggest that the uneven way in which transnational \nnetworks are inserted into territories has an influence on geographic patterns of organizational \npractice. Thus, inward investment, telecommunications, EU export linkages and colonial ties, all \nemerge in our study as statistically significant determinants of national ISO 9000 certification \ncounts. Our study therefore contributes to a growing body of relational economic geography \nemphasizing the importance of networks and, moreover, their inherent spatiality, in explaining \nthe uneven outcomes of economic globalization (Coe and Yeung 2001; Dicken, Kelly, Olds and \nYeung 2001; Bathelt and Gl\u00fcckler 2003). \nOur empirical analysis also locates a major role for the domestic context in the uneven \ngeography of organizational practice. Again, the idea that national environmental characteristics \ninfluence the diffusion of knowledge, ideas and practices is not new. Our specific contribution, \n 35 \nhowever, is to (re-)emphasize the importance of the economic. Based on the observation that our \ncountry-level environmental variables \u2013 share of manufacturing in GDP, economic productivity, \nregulatory burden and human capital \u2013 all potentially influence the cost-benefit ratio of \ncertification, we argue that the domestic context is important through its influence on the \neconomic returns to adoption. \nThis is potentially significant for two reasons. First, it suggests that the influence of the \ndomestic environment is not restricted to institutional variables, widely implicated in previous \ngeographic research as constraining organizational convergence (Pauly and Reich 1997; Argent \n2002; Christopherson 2002; Cox 2004). Other, arguably more mundane, characteristics are also \nimportant. These include various country-level variables \u2013 structure of the economy, level of \nhuman capital, and so on \u2013 collectively influencing the financial costs and benefits of new \norganizational practices. Of course, recognizing that economy, culture and society are co-\nproduced, we do not wish to suggest that institutional characteristics do not matter in the uneven \nglobal diffusion of new ideas, practices and strategies. They clearly do (Gertler 2001). \nNevertheless, our study reinforces recent critiques of the \u201ccultural turn\u201d, cautioning against \nexplanations in economic geography which exclusively privilege the \u201csocio-institutional\u201d over \nthe economic (Martin and Sunley 2001).  \nThe influence of the economic in the diffusion of ISO 9000 is also potentially significant \nsince it challenges existing theories of new-institutionalism. These theories reject the idea of \nrational, profit-maximizing action and, instead, maintain that take-up of new organizational \npractices is primarily governed by managers\u2019 quest for legitimacy (Abrahamson 1996). The \nfindings presented in this paper do not entirely contradict this position. Indeed, the influence of, \nfor example, TNCs, suggests that institutionalized pressures for conformity may play an \n 36 \nimportant role in the spread of new practices. Equally, however, our results suggest that \nefficiency considerations are also significant. That is, as well as questions of legitimacy, \ncalculative managers may pay attention to economic costs, benefits and profitability in deciding \nwhether or not to adopt new organizational practices.  \n    Taken together, then, our study reinforces the findings of recent studies which suggest \nthat organizational convergence at the global level is both uneven and contingent (Coe and \nYeung 2001; Gertler 2001; Cox 2004; Poon and Thompson 2004). No doubt globalization \u2013 the \nintensification of economic, political and social linkages at the international level \u2013 has increased \nthe mobility of organizational innovations across national boundaries. Yet, as evidenced by \nsignificant variations in take-up of ISO 9000 at the country level, this does not imply cross-\nnational organizational convergence. One reason for these continuing differences, of course, is \nthat the spatial pattern of cross-national interconnection is itself highly geographically uneven. \nFlows of inward investment into territories, the availability of telecommunications, and so on, \nvary significantly across the globe. Another reason, and one which resonates with the findings of \nprevious research, is that certain national environments are more favorable to the uptake of \norganizational innovation than others.  In fact, given far-reaching geographic variations in these \ndeterminants, it is perhaps unsurprising that spatial unevenness is a persistent feature of \norganizational transfer, diffusion and convergence at the global level. \n \n 37 \nReferences \nAbbott, K.
