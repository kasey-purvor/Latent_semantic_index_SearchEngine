At different territorial\nscales \u2013 from the world, to among Member States of the EU, and within them\n\u2013 there are conspicuous gaps in wealth, in the density of population and\neconomic activity, and in the compositions of regional and national econo-\nmies. Since the early 1980s, the EU has witnessed parallel processes of\ncross-national convergence, with countries in the original periphery of\nEurope catching up, and within country divergence, characterized by rising\nrelative incomes in well-off regions. A number of studies have demonstrated\nthat inter-regional disparities have grown since the 1980s, measured in terms\nof GDP per capita and employment (cf. Puga, 1999; Martin, 2000; Midelfart-\nKnarvik and Overman, 2002; Overman and Puga, 2002; Puga, 2002). The\nstandard deviation of per capita GDP (EU-15 = 100) for Member States as a\nwhole has declined from 12.5 in 1990 to 11.4 in 2000, but that same index\nincreased from 26.5 to 28.5 for sub-national regions within Member States.\nSince the reform of the Structural Funds in 1989, the EU has made the\nprinciple of cohesion \u2013 of reducing disparities in economic outcome and\nopportunity among European regions \u2013 one of its key policies. In the context\nof rapidly changing economic, demographic and political realities in the EU,\ncohesion policy has become an ever larger component of the EU budget. The\nfunds made available to support cohesion objectives have more than doubled\nin real terms since the late 1980s, making it now the greatest area of com-\nmitment within the EU budget. For the period 2007\u201313, \u20ac347 billion (at\ncurrent prices) has been allocated for cohesion funds, more than 80 per cent\nof which is targeted at promoting \u2018convergence\u2019.1\nMuch of the language of European cohesion policy eschews the idea of\ntrade-offs between efficiency and equity, suggesting it is possible to maximize\noverall growth while also achieving convergence in outcomes and productiv-\nity across Europe\u2019s regions. Yet, given the rise in inter-regional disparities, it\nis unclear that cohesion policy has altered the pathway of development from\nwhat would have occurred in the absence of intervention.2 The reasons for this\nare complex and while some of them may have to do with the procedures for\nimplementation of convergence policies or perhaps the scale of intervention\n1 Source: Commission, DG Region; see \u00abhttp:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/regional_policy\/policy\/fonds\/index_en.htm\u00bb.\n2 Much research effort has gone into answering the question of whether European regional development\nintervention has met its objectives, with little clarity resulting. Recent analyses reach widely differing\nconclusions. While some studies find that the EU development effort since the 1989 reform of the\nStructural Funds has had almost no impact (e.g. Boldrin and Canova, 2001; Dall\u2019Erba and Le Gallo, 2007),\nothers indicate that it has been a success (e.g. Cappelen et al., 2003). In between there are those who point\nout that the impact of the Structural Funds has been limited (e.g. Bussoletti and Esposti, 2004), mixed (e.g.\nPuigcerver-Pe\u00f1alver, 2007) or tends to vary according to differences in emphasis across development axes\n(Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Fratesi, 2004) or from one geographical location to another (Percoco, 2005).\n1090 THOMAS FAROLE, ANDR\u00c9S RODR\u00cdGUEZ-POSE AND MICHAEL STORPER\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\n(e.g. in comparison to equivalent US federal policies), others may well have\nto do with the absence of a realistic view of the economic geography of\ndevelopment and hence of the possibilities, constraints and potential trade-\noffs faced by efforts to promote convergence.\nThus, any fresh look at cohesion policy would be well advised to recon-\nsider a complex set of potential trade-offs and interrelations: overall growth\nand efficiency; inter-territorial equity; territorial democracy and governance\ncapacities; and social equity within places.\nI. The Sources of Growth and the Tendency towards Agglomeration\nFor much of the period between the 1960s and the 1980s, the theories of trade\nand integration deployed to explain the geographical pattern of economic\ndevelopment tended to ignore the possibility that such development would\ncluster strongly in certain places (cities and regions, and within certain coun-\ntries), and generate long-run income divergence. The neoclassical and\nHeckscher-Ohlin models emphasized the dispersion of economic activity,\naccording to the principle of comparative advantage, and economic conver-\ngence, through subsequent adjustment of factor proportions in different\nplaces. The predictions of these theories found some empirical support within\nEurope and the US: the post-war decades witnessed widespread economic\nconvergence both at the national and at the regional level (Barro, 1991).\nHowever, the evidence for the usefulness of such theories was weaker at\nwider territorial scales, such as in relations between highly developed and\nmuch less developed countries and regions. And indeed, some development\neconomists in the 1950s and 1960s (e.g. Myrdal, 1957; Hirschman, 1958)\nemphasized that economic activity had \u2018circular and cumulative\u2019 patterns.\nSome economists attempted to reconcile these two perspectives by arguing\nthat areas such as western Europe or North America represented selective\nconvergence processes, or \u2018convergence clubs\u2019, where convergence would be\npossible among economies with similar \u2018structural\u2019 characteristics (Quah,\n1996; L\u00f3pez-Bazo et al., 1999). A more complex picture emerges at wider\nterritorial scales (such as, for example, the world, or eastern\u2013western\nEurope), where underlying structural capacities of economies are quite dif-\nferent. To complicate matters further, since the late 1980s \u2013 and especially\nsince the beginning of the 1990s \u2013 there appears to be a trend towards\nwidening within country (i.e. cross-regional) disparities (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose,\n1999; Puga, 2002). Economic integration is unleashing forces benefiting core\nregions within countries, often to the detriment of the periphery. This is\nhappening virtually all over the world, with large cities in China, India,\nCOHESION POLICY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION 1091\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nAustralia, Japan, Brazil, Mexico and elsewhere experiencing more rapid,\nsustained growth than medium-sized cities and rural hinterlands (Kanbur and\nVenables, 2005). Europe is typical, and large cities have generally outper-\nformed other regions both within and outside their national boundaries. This\nis the case for London, Paris, the Randstad, Madrid, Rome, the Scandinavian\ncapitals, Dublin and most other capitals in Europe. In sum, while integration\nin the EU to date has promoted inter-national convergence, sub-national\ninter-regional inequalities have tended to increase.\nResearch suggests these trends are driven by:\n1. the technological paradigm driving growth, and especially innovation and\nits geography;\n2. geographical integration of markets, combined with greater organizational\nand geographical fragmentation of production;\n3. the persistence of institutional differences between places despite\nintegration.\nIn this light, tendencies towards the geographical agglomeration of certain\ntypes of activities are likely to continue for the foreseeable future. This\ngenerates powerful tendencies toward income divergence, between \u2018core\nregions\u2019 (i.e. those regions within which are located the largest economic\nagglomerations) and \u2018peripheries\u2019 (i.e. regions generally lacking similar\nagglomerations and often the potential to generate scale economies). Though\nthere are also powerful forces for convergence operating at the same time \u2013\nnotably the organizational fragmentation and geographical de-localization of\nproduction, as well as improvement in institutions in peripheral areas \u2013 they\nmay not be powerful enough to counteract divergence. The \u2018spread\u2019 of devel-\nopment may be thus overwhelmed by the \u2018backwash\u2019 of income effects (big\nhome markets) and technology effects (core regions move up the technologi-\ncal ladder faster than backward regions can catch up) (Myrdal, 1957). To our\nknowledge, a half-century of more sophisticated trade and location models\nhas not overturned this fundamental geographical logic of development.\nAs noted, however, great progress has been made in understanding the\nmechanisms of geographical development processes since the 1950s. Three\nsuch academic efforts to understand the persistence of development to\ngenerate core and periphery regions are most relevant in this regard.\nThe first are \u2018new economic geography\u2019 models, which emphasize how\nmarket integration, scale economies, transport costs and home market effects\ncombine to favour the concentration of economic activity in \u2018core\u2019 regions,\nand how the advantages of large, flexible, highly specialized labour markets\nand localized technological spillovers reinforce these tendencies (Krugman,\n1991; Fujita et al., 1999).\n1092 THOMAS FAROLE, ANDR\u00c9S RODR\u00cdGUEZ-POSE AND MICHAEL STORPER\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nSecondly, models grounded in endogenous growth theory, including inno-\nvation economics (Schumpeterian growth theories), focus on innovation \u2013 the\noutward movement of the technological frontier and the ongoing extension of\nquality ladders and \u2018product spaces\u2019, and the positions of territories relative\nto this frontier (Romer, 1986; Lucas, 1988; Grossman and Helpman, 1991;\nAghion and Howitt, 2005). These models stress change and adaptive effi-\nciency rather than the adjustment towards an optimal, equilibrium allocation\nof factors between places. The economy is seen as a restless search for new\nproducts and processes with high rates of return, but where the potential to do\nthis is unevenly distributed across territories. There is considerable empirical\nevidence in favour of this position, indicating that high factor cost areas,\nsuch as the core regions of the EU, are increasingly specialized at the top of\n\u2018quality ladders\u2019 (products with high knowledge and technology content as\nwell as advanced producer services) and that their exports correlate well to\nthe areas in which they innovate (Patel and Pavitt, 1991). Thus, economic\ngeography and growth economics both emphasize innovation and processes\nof learning \u2013 knowledge creation and assimilation. They come together in that\nthe human capital necessary to innovate operates through networks of knowl-\nedge transmission and training. This has important spatial implications since\nthe transaction costs of transmitting knowledge remain high, often involving\nface-to-face contact, defined institutional channels and long periods to build\nup these channels.\nA third school of research argues that institutions are the key force in\ndetermining where a region is situated with respect to the technology frontier,\nbecause institutions shape the ability of an economy to use and develop its\nresources. These institutional factors can also contribute to the agglomeration\nof economic activity, insofar as institutional capacities are unevenly distrib-\nuted, reinforcing the concentration of the most advanced activities in metro-\npolitan settings in particular, and in highly developed countries in general.\nOne important set of institutions are those facilitating innovation R&D,\nventure capital financing and business support\/facilitation; these are known\ncollectively as \u2018systems of innovation\u2019 (Lundvall, 1992; Nelson, 1993). A\ncertain economic scale is required to sustain such a range of institutions;\nmoreover, only certain regions have the capacity to develop or attract the\nhuman capital and other resources needed to maintain such institutions at\nsufficient levels of quality. Second, as good institutional conditions are often\nhard to replicate, even mobile investments in innovation-oriented activities\ntend to concentrate where these favourable institutional conditions are found.\nOn the other side, institutional weaknesses, stemming from lack of knowl-\nedge, capacity or the protection of existing rents, may result in political\ncoalitions holding back appropriate institutional development, and policies\nCOHESION POLICY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION 1093\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\ninappropriate for sustaining innovation and growth given their position rela-\ntive to different types of frontiers (i.e. institutional, educational and, above\nall, the world technological frontier) (Persson et al., 1997; Grossman and\nHelpman, 2001; Acemoglu, 2006; Acemoglu and Johnson, 2006).\nThe geography of cores and peripheries is the combined result of agglom-\neration tendencies, the uneven geography of innovation, the process of geo-\ngraphical fragmentation of production and the recursive feedbacks of these\nforces to the geography of institutional capacities. At any given moment, we\nmay think of a stylized picture of three different \u2018places\u2019 depending on\ntheir position relative to the world technology frontier (Aghion and Howitt,\n2005, p. 7):\n\u2022 places at or near the frontier: characterized by high levels of skilled labour\nand access to capital, with few institutional and cultural barriers to devel-\noping and adopting new technologies; these tend to be core regions;\n\u2022 places further from the frontier: characterized by a lower mix of skilled (vs\nunskilled) labour and\/or limited access to capital; may face barriers to\nadopting and assimilating technology due to human capital, institutional\nand\/or cultural constraints; these are possible near-term transition zones in\nthe geographical division of labour;\n\u2022 places far from the frontier: characterized by high concentrations of\nunskilled labour, limited access to capacity, low productivity and substan-\ntial cultural and institutional barriers to adopting technology; these are\nmore often located in the periphery.\nThe locations of countries and regions relative to the different technology,\neducational, institutional and other types of frontiers vary substantially on a\nglobal scale; this is also the case within the EU, which has a mosaic of\npositions relative to the technological\/quality ladder hierarchy. In the EU, this\ntends to play out within an urban\u2013regional hierarchy, exhibiting strong met-\nropolitanization effects. Close to the frontier we find mainly metro regions or\nregions adjacent to major metro areas. Other metro areas, often secondary\ncities within national urban systems, tend to be further from the frontier.\nFinally, lower-income regions, mainly located in the periphery, remain gen-\nerally far from the technology frontier. There also appears to be a macro-\ngeography to this, with core\u2013periphery patterns nested at both the national\nand European levels. Metropolitan areas within northern and western Europe,\nwhich benefit from being geographically closer to the economic centre of\nEurope, tend to be closer to the frontier than those in southern and eastern\nEurope which are located further from the largest European agglomerations.\nThis indicates that agglomeration and comparative advantages forces are at\nwork over various, overlapping scales. Within the EU, there is a tendency for\n1094 THOMAS FAROLE, ANDR\u00c9S RODR\u00cdGUEZ-POSE AND MICHAEL STORPER\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\ninnovation and economic output to concentrate in the economic core; within\ncountries concentration is in the existing core regions; and within regions,\nthere is a tendency to concentrate in urban areas.\nA final point can now be made, which brings this discussion back\ninto a temporal context. From the 1960s to the 1980s, it appeared to some\nresearchers that convergence processes then in evidence \u2013 known as \u2018club\nconvergence\u2019 \u2013 would slowly but surely gain ground at wider and wider\nspatial scales. But the major structural change in the world economy in the\n1980s seems to have increased the importance of innovation for economic\ngrowth, and with it powerful trends towards agglomeration at various spatial\nscales, and with that, the importance of spatially uneven distribution of\ninstitutional capacities to innovate. The result is the \u2018backwash\u2019 that has been\nin evidence recently, in the form of complex, and stubborn, spatial hierarchy\nof incomes, within Europe and at the world scale.\nII. Is there a Conflict between Efficiency and Convergence?\nWe have noted that, even though there are indeed forces for convergence\nunleashed by integration, there are also many forces pushing in the other\ndirection. It is precisely this notion that underlies the call for policies encour-\naging convergence or inter-territorial equity within the EU. But, as should\nalso be clear, such policies are not only costly, but may also have unintended\neffects.\nAgglomeration is generally good for economic growth and development\nbecause it is the privileged geographical form taken by economic systems\nwhich carry out extensive innovation (World Bank, 2009). The link between\ninnovation and agglomeration tends to be self-reinforcing: innovative activi-\nties tend towards agglomeration; and the greater the economic agglomeration,\nthe greater the potential for innovation, for knowledge spillovers and for\nhigher levels of economic growth. Excessive equality may thus be detrimental\nfor economic growth if it involves limiting the productivity- and innovation-\nenhancing effects of agglomeration; some degree of inter-regional inequality\nmay therefore raise the overall rate of growth. Regional inequalities in the EU\nare higher than those found in the US, but also significantly lower than those\nfound in most countries in the developing world (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Gill,\n2004). Agglomerations do generate spillovers, both in terms of economic\nmultipliers and, critically, the spread of knowledge; however, these exhibit\nspatial selectivity and suffer from strong distance-decay effects (Audretsch\nand Feldman, 2004). Thus, most spillovers tend to accrue to regions sur-\nrounding cutting-edge metropolitan areas. Knowledge spillovers to other\nCOHESION POLICY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION 1095\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nmetropolitan areas arise, where they are well networked (including physical\ntransport and communications links, as well as links within firm and industry\nproduction chains) as part of an integrated urban system. But the scope for\nthis is limited. Even within highly developed countries, sparsely populated\nregions are unlikely to benefit from the knowledge spillovers generated at the\ncore, as they lack the connections to access them, the capacity to assimilate\nthem and the scale to enable them to function through the formation of local\nagglomerations. For similar reasons peripheral regions at the European-wide\nscale are unlikely to capture a significant share of the spillovers resulting from\nagglomerations in the European core, except for cities at the top of their urban\nhierarchies.\nInequalities in growth across regions may not be harmful in the short term,\nas long as growth across all regions is robust. In a \u2018race to the top\u2019 scenario\neven the losers may be better off than when the race began. Thus, in an\nanalogy to \u2018gains to trade\u2019, agglomeration (as a geographical expression of\nspecialization) may indeed be essential to maximizing overall output, but the\ndistribution of those gains may be uneven. There are, of course, limits on the\ndegree to which agglomeration contributes to greater growth. Particularly as\nagglomerations seem to occur in metropolitan environments where space may\nbe limited (and in the European context at least, there has generally been a\nstrong consensus in favour of containing the spread of metropolitan growth),\nthey also create diseconomies (Duranton and Puga, 2000). These manifest\nthemselves in congestion (time), housing costs (with knock-on implications\nfor wages and other inputs) and environmental degradation. Yet on the whole,\nthe evidence points to a positive association between agglomeration and\neconomic growth (Bourguignon and Morrison, 2002). This suggests that if\nEurope is to remain competitive in a more integrated world, and if Europe is\nto become more of an innovative \u2018first mover\u2019 in the global economy, agglom-\neration may be the geographical underpinning of so doing. Indeed, compari-\nsons of the economic geography of the EU to that of the US show that Europe\nhas fewer and smaller specialized agglomerations than the US, and many\nscholars believe this difference enhances the US\u2019 ability to dominate new,\ninnovative sectors of the world economy (Midelfart-Knarvik and Overman,\n2002; Crescenzi et al., 2007).\nIn this light, it is urgent that Europe get a more precise handle on the\npotential trade-offs involved in pursuing goals of growth and innovation and\nthose of convergence and equity. There is likely an analogy to the models used\nto assess the overall benefits of regional integration in a world economy: if\nconvergence is pursued via policies attempting to spread existing economic\nactivity, there will be a complex set of \u2018creation\u2019 benefits (linkages of poorer\nto richer regions, with positive effects on output and income), there will be\n1096 THOMAS FAROLE, ANDR\u00c9S RODR\u00cdGUEZ-POSE AND MICHAEL STORPER\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\ntrade \u2018diversion\u2019 costs (costs of de-agglomeration and loss of comparative\nadvantage optimization) and there will be complex dynamic, endogenous\nfeedbacks of the two (terms of trade effects as poorer regions enter the\neconomy, especially, which may actually favour the richer regions in the\nend). In any case, the overall costs and benefits of convergence-through-\nredistribution strategies require much more careful estimation and the results\nmay turn out to be counter-intuitive (Dupont and Martin, 2003; Martin, 2005)\nand Europe needs to have a much more scientifically rigorous approach\nto theorizing and measuring such effects as it considers such policies. At\npresent, we do not have sufficiently precise data to determine the \u2018right\u2019 target\nlevels of these two complex phenomena in interaction, especially because\ndoing anything to change either of them involves opportunity costs for the\nother if it requires significant redistribution of resources. This is therefore a\nmajor open area for policy research and formulation.\nIII. Reframing the Question\nA more interesting question, however, is suggested when we move beyond\nthis way of conceptualizing the relationship between equity and development.\nIndeed, while agglomeration forces may restrict the potential for convergence\nacross regions, they do not explain fully the gap in productive output between\nleading and lagging3 regions in the EU. Many lagging regions are not simply\nfailing to maintain the pace of growth and development being achieved in\nleading regions, they are failing to make productive use of the resources\navailable. This is the problem of persistent (or durable) underdevelopment \u2013\ni.e. of regions producing consistently below their production possibilities\nfrontier. The more thorny question has to do with whether such certain uneven\ngeographical patterns of development can have potentially perverse dynamic\nstructural effects, by which we mean they lead to divergent capacities to\nengage in development between developed and less developed regions,\nthereby contributing to the problem of underdevelopment. In more conven-\ntional terms, \u2018capacities\u2019 refers to the probability that a place will be able to\nadjust its use of factors to move up the technology frontier or product space,\nand \u2018divergent capacities\u2019 exist when there are durable differences in the rate\nat which this can be done by different territories. Such structural inequalities,\nfor example, would become circular and cumulative when skilled human\ncapital emigrates to leading regions, weakening innovative capacities in\n3 Defined here as regions with per capita GDP substantially below the EU average and\/or regions with\noutput and employment levels well below the EU average.\nCOHESION POLICY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION 1097\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nlagging regions, leading to adverse selection effects for the existing popula-\ntion and for political behaviours and institutions, in a \u2018vicious circle\u2019 scenario.\nThis idea is not new, but it carries with it a steep methodological challenge,\nwhich is twofold. On one hand, it would require a more precise definition\nof the probabilities that a place will, or will not, move up the technology\nfrontier\/product space, and over what type of time horizon. On the other hand,\nit would require identifying whether active intervention could improve these\nprobabilities, and precisely how it would improve capacities to move up the\ntechnological frontier\/product space, and which such capacities are amenable\nto improvement with intervention.\nIV. Sources of Underdevelopment of Capacities\nThe underdevelopment of capacities stems from a range of factors, the rela-\ntive importance of which will vary across regions. Endogenous and Schum-\npeterian growth models point to problems of low levels of human capital and\nlow capacity to innovate and assimilate innovations as factors limiting growth\npotential. New economic geography models emphasize insufficient scale and\npoor accessibility to markets. Other lines of thinking underline the gap in\ntechnological and innovation capacities between regions, sometimes attri-\nbuted to differences in human capital levels, others to differences in structural\nR&D\/science capacity, and others to the quality of firms and entrepreneur-\nialism. Still others consider that these differences might be generated, in the\nlong run, by differences in the quality of their economic, social and political\ninstitutions. Much of the recent research on economic growth identifies insti-\ntutions as a fundamental determinant of a region\u2019s or a nation\u2019s economic\ngrowth trajectory. Many lagging areas are beset by problems of institutional\nsclerosis, clientelism, corruption and pervasive rent-seeking by durable local\nelites who have an incentive to block innovation (Acemoglu and Robinson,\n2000). Informal institutions in these places are often similarly dysfunctional,\nresulting in low levels of trust and declining associative capacity, and restrict-\ning the potential for effective collective action. In such an environment where\ninstitutions are \u2018inappropriate\u2019, a region is likely to fail to break out of low\ngrowth and low productivity traps. Weak institutions may have negative\ninfluence on the provision of public goods and on the development and\ndelivery of policies aimed at improving skills or innovation capacity, or other\npotential sources of growth.\nSuch an environment of inappropriate institutions tends to have cumula-\ntive effects, leading to vicious circles of low growth. The poor conditions for\ninvestment in lagging regions may lead to a further concentration of economic\n1098 THOMAS FAROLE, ANDR\u00c9S RODR\u00cdGUEZ-POSE AND MICHAEL STORPER\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nactivity in already existing development poles, exacerbating trends toward\ndivergence. And increasing levels of divergence often contribute to under-\nmine an already weak institutional capacity and quality in lagging regions,\nentrenching underdevelopment.\nV. From Theory to Logics of Intervention\nIn light of the above, it can now be seen that there are two different challenges\nto be faced by cohesion policy. The first relates to \u2018unevenness\u2019 and the fact\nthat the factors driving economic growth appear to have a tendency towards\nagglomeration, concentrating growth in core, metropolitan regions at the\nexpense of less populated and peripherally located ones. The second relates to\n\u2018persistent underdevelopment\u2019, which has a number of endogenous causes,\nincluding the inability to generate agglomeration as well as a tendency\ntowards poor institutional environments.\nIn looking at the reasons for intervention to address unevenness and\ndurable underdevelopment, it is useful to remember that cohesion policy has\nhistorically been assigned three objectives: equity (essentially equality of\neconomic outcome and opportunity through redistribution), growth (reducing\nthe underutilization of resources) and legitimacy (promoting and preserving\nthe legitimacy of the EU and its institutions). These create a complex EU\npolicy field with a certain number of objectives that are not necessarily\nmutually consistent:\n(1) Promoting growth versus reducing underdevelopment as policy\nobjectives: perhaps it is most difficult to justify the need of a cohesion\npolicy on the grounds of reducing inter-regional inequalities. Since promot-\ning higher levels of growth may require accepting geographical concentra-\ntion of economic activity, generally in the best-endowed regions, there are\nlikely to be trade-offs between aggregate economic efficiency and promot-\ning convergence.\n(2) Reducing underdevelopment in a growth-enhancing way \u2013 develop-\nment of capacities: the case for intervention to respond to persistent under-\ndevelopment has to do principally with the imperfect state of European\nintegration, involving barriers to labour and capital mobility. In the absence of\nsignificant internal labour mobility, it becomes more difficult for underdevel-\noped regions to lower their unemployment rates, especially as labour mobility\nis more limited for the less skilled, leading to a combination of brain drain and\nunderemployment\/unemployment for the worst-off regions. Though capital\nmobility has increased, it is highest for activities relatively far away from the\ntechnological frontier, amenable to fragmentation and long-distance trade,\nCOHESION POLICY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION 1099\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nand biased toward the use of less-skilled labour. Close to the frontier, embed-\ndedness in innovation networks limits spatial mobility to circulation and\nintegration principally among the already developed regions. Taken together,\nthe potential for aggregate growth in the EU may be prejudiced by resulting\nunderdevelopment. While the EU may want to take action to promote\nincreased labour mobility, this is likely to take a long time to bear fruit and it\nmay never reach North American levels. Increasing the innovative capacities\nof less innovative regions will require policies that go beyond mere opening\nof borders. The policy concerns of enhancing growth in underdeveloped\nregions (as opposed to the aggregate growth of the EU as a whole) and\ncombating underdevelopment of these regions have some overlap, but once\nagain, the opportunity costs to aggregate EU growth and welfare require\ncareful assessment.\n(3) Social development: within the EU there is widespread consensus to\nprovide a certain standard of living and public service provision to all citi-\nzens; welfare is widely considered to consist not just of income levels, or\naggregate income, but of satisfaction of basic needs.\n(4) Political stability: the presence of persistent and perhaps growing\nterritorial inequalities has been the source of political tensions within many\nMember States of the EU.\n(5) Legitimacy of the EU: persistent underdevelopment is considered by\nsome to weaken the legitimacy of the EU, as it would indicate a failure to\ndeliver on some of its core objectives to enhance the welfare of all its\ncitizens.\nVI. The Risks of Intervention\nA provisional case for intervention to address underdevelopment in a growth-\nenhancing way seems to emerge from existing theory and evidence, but this\ndoes not mean that it is costless or free of risk. Among the main risks a\ncohesion policy should consider are the potential for interventions to:\n\u2022 distort the efficient functioning of markets in the regions by favouring\ninvestments in activities inappropriate given the region\u2019s location\nrelative to the technology frontier. This is particularly likely where\nregions adopt policies not based on localized sources of comparative\nadvantage and\/or where they attempt to replicate wholesale that which\nhas been successful in other regions (e.g. the plethora of would-be\n\u2018Silicon Valleys\u2019);\n\u2022 crowd out private investment, leaving the region vulnerable to fall back into\ndecline once public funding dries up;\n1100 THOMAS FAROLE, ANDR\u00c9S RODR\u00cdGUEZ-POSE AND MICHAEL STORPER\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\n\u2022 shelter regions from markets, rendering them ever less able to adapt to\nchanging external conditions;\n\u2022 create a dependency culture, where in the name of generating \u2018structural\nchange\u2019, regions come to rely on transfers and experience convergence in\nconsumption but persistent divergence in productive output and potential;\n\u2022 entrench existing elites by propping up ineffective, clientelistic institutions\nand fuelling rent-extracting machines.\nIn addition, interventions \u2013 particularly those designed to generate innovative\nand adaptive growth \u2013 tend to be often vague, providing a blanket authoriza-\ntion for spending on a wide range of \u2013 often ineffectual and poorly monitored\n\u2013 programmes and projects. It is therefore critical that the objectives of\naddressing underdevelopment in a growth-enhancing way be sharply distin-\nguished from: (a) convergence policies; (b) policies to address underdevel-\nopment that have few community-wide growth-enhancing effects; (c) policies\nfor social cohesion and meeting basic needs, that have few growth-enhancing\nproperties. These are fundamentally different policy objectives.\nVII. What is Appropriate Intervention? Types of Territories,\nTypes of Intervention\nAddressing underdevelopment in a growth-enhancing way necessarily\nrequires basing policies on the many and varied types of underdevelopment\ndynamics to be found in the EU\u2019s regions. In other words, it cannot be done\nvia a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 policy framework or mechanically applied criteria for\nintervention. There are major challenges to specify new criteria for interven-\ntion on underdevelopment and with the goal of building capacities that can\nenhance growth. To see this in more depth, we need to identify different types\nof territories, as well as different aims of intervention.\nDifferent types of regions may be classified (broadly) as:\n\u2022 metropolitan regions at the core of the EU;\n\u2022 metropolitan regions in peripheral and less developed regions of the EU;\n\u2022 regions adjacent to metropolitan regions;\n\u2022 peripheral regions with relatively large populations and urban centres;\n\u2022 rural and peripheral regions with sparse populations.\nDifferent aims of intervention might include:\n\u2022 enhancing growth for the EU as a whole, possibly by supporting efficiency\nand innovation in leading agglomerations;\n\u2022 spreading innovation\/growth by facilitating spatial spillovers and linkages\nto highly developed places;\nCOHESION POLICY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION 1101\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\n\u2022 promoting innovation\/growth in certain non-core regions deemed to have\nreal medium-term potential to move up the technology hierarchy\/product\nspace;\n\u2022 addressing underdevelopment through a combination of transfers, public\ngoods provision and institutional reform, in order to enhance long-term\ngrowth capacity of these regions, whose potential for moving up the\ninnovation\/product quality hierarchy is limited, but potential for increasing\nproductivity is nonetheless considerable;\n\u2022 addressing equity for regions with limited potential to increase innovation\nor productivity, while admitting that it might have trade-offs (in the form of\nopportunity costs) to EU-wide growth and efficiency.\nThus, in the latter two categories, territorially targeting many policies that\npromote growth or combat certain dimensions of underdevelopment may lead\nto lower aggregate growth, but a different territorial and social distribution of\ngrowth. If the aim of policy is to maximize economic growth, there is a case\nfor intervention designed to improve the potential of individuals and firms,\nincluding in the wealthiest regions. Beyond this, many growth-enhancing\npolicies should not be territorially targeted. Many of the institutional factors\nthat facilitate innovation and growth are best enabled at the national level, or\nin some cases the EU level. These include tax policies for R&D, laws and\nframeworks governing firm start-ups, venture capital markets, bankruptcy\nlaws, cultures of success and failure, reforms of R&D and research systems,\noverall educational expenditures; in short, many of the factors that encompass\nnational (and EU) systems of innovation (Lundvall, 1992; Nelson, 1993). In\nother words, the paradox is that policies for both enhancing overall growth\nand combating underdevelopment may better be achieved in a non-spatially\ntargeted way. This, in combination with policies that reduce barriers to the\nmobility of capital and labour, should lead to firms and individuals being able\nto make better choices of productivity- or innovation-enhancing locations.\nThe results of this type of intervention may vary across the EU. In old\nMember States the likely result would be to reinforce inter-national conver-\ngence within western Europe but to reproduce inter-regional differences. New\nMember States that have successful agglomerations would probably enjoy\na certain convergence tendency with EU averages, but this may come at the\nprice of exacerbating inter-regional inequalities. In contrast, new members\nwithout the medium-term probability of building core innovative regions are\nlikely to have slower growth in their (sub-national) inter-regional inequalities,\nbut lower overall convergence, if at all, towards the EU average.\nHowever, in the cases of both growth promotion and reduction of under-\ndevelopment, it might be that delivery of general-purpose policies will be\n1102 THOMAS FAROLE, ANDR\u00c9S RODR\u00cdGUEZ-POSE AND MICHAEL STORPER\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nmost effective when it involves territorial agencies. This is because many\nimportant institutions, including regional labour markets, education and train-\ning institutions, business associations and chambers of commerce, and indi-\nvidual research institutions, function primarily at the regional and local level.\nTo take the previous example of policies to reform systems of innovation:\nmany critical reforms must be enacted at large territorial scales; but parts of\ntheir implementation require the involvement of regional and local scales.\nThus, there are two potential roles for regional and local institutions, that\nshould not be confused: one is as an autonomous policy actor setting local,\ncontext-specific goals (true subsidiarity); the other is as an embedded delivery\nsystem for policies set at higher territorial scales, but cannot be implemented\nexclusively from those scales (multi-level governance and implementation).\nThe task for policy-makers is to understand precisely which interventions are\nappropriate at each scale.\nFrom a purely economic point of view, combating underdevelopment to\nenhance growth requires a mixture of multi-level governance and true sub-\nsidiarity. On economic grounds, the existence of technological and other\ntypes of frontiers means that the implementation of similar measures in\ndifferent territories may yield widely varying results. One example of this is\nthe presence of technological thresholds, below which the benefits of invest-\nments in high-order technologies do not accrue. Regions away from the\ntechnological frontier may thus achieve lower returns on investment in R&D\nthan metropolitan regions located in the core of Europe. In contrast, periph-\neral regions may achieve greater returns by investing in human capital and in\ndeveloping their capacity to assimilate innovations generated elsewhere. On\ninstitutional grounds, the quality of local institutions tends to have a substan-\ntial impact on the degree to which interventions achieve their intended out-\ncomes. Regions with poor institutional settings are ineffective in supporting\ninnovative activity or assimilating knowledge and innovation. As a result,\npolicies of development promotion often fail to be implemented correctly; or\nworse, rent-seeking elites capture or distort the benefits of the intervention,\nentrenching their privileged positions and exacerbating inequalities within the\nregion. Arguably the EU may have been wasting money by giving, under the\nprinciple of subsidiarity, greater responsibility for cohesion interventions\nto institutions that lack the capacity to formulate and\/or implement them\neffectively, or indeed who are controlled by elites with a disincentive to see\nthrough the changes intended by the interventions.\nHowever, the question of how to intervene in order to improve institutions\nis not easy to answer. \u2018Institution-building\u2019 is politically appealing and appro-\npriate institutions are strongly suggested by theory and evidence as key to\ncreating the capacities for economic development. The problem is that there\nCOHESION POLICY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION 1103\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nare few systematic lessons from the literature as to how policy can improve or\nbuild institutions, and indeed, the widespread vagueness about the subject\ncarries a risk of squandering public funds and effort on programmes that may\nhave little impact and possibly high opportunity costs. What we do know is\nthat there are several ways institutions can improve economic performance\nand reduce underdevelopment: (a) promoting openness to new ideas and\nagents (otherwise known as \u2018absorption capacity\u2019); (b) limiting clientelism\nand rent-seeking; (c) reducing transaction costs; and (d) under some circum-\nstances, changing time horizons to improve \u2018staying power\u2019 of parties where\nlong latency periods are at hand. There is an additional, more controversial\nrole for institutions, which is (e) changing expectations in the economy, and\nbreaking out of the \u2018adverse selection\u2019 dynamic which can emerge when the\nexisting state of the economy and its actor networks determine the \u2018needs\u2019 to\nwhich institutions address themselves. This is the thorny matter of whether\ninstitutions can transform an economy by looking well beyond its current\ndevelopment level. Note that objectives (c) and (d) may have a potentially\nuncomfortable relationship to objectives (a) and (b). Whereas (a) and (b) are\nabout newness and openness, (c) and (d) are about staying power and\nco-ordination. The problem is that frequently, in Europe, policies favour the\nlatter and often degenerate into excuses for rent-seeking clientelism. The\nutmost care must be taken to define precisely the criteria for different policy\nobjectives and to ensure this does not happen. We do not have good estimates\nof the costs of transforming institutions in sub-national regions, or of raising\ncapacities of persistently underdeveloped regions. But international evidence\n\u2013 from research on \u2018success stories\u2019 such as Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea,\nIsrael and Ireland \u2013 concludes there are high social rates of return on well-\ncalibrated efforts in this regard.\nTwo other possible types of intervention can also be considered, for\nopposite points in the \u2018opportunity spectrum\u2019. There are certain regions\nrelatively far from the technology frontier, but that may offer opportunities for\nmoving up along it. In Europe, this is likely to be certain metropolitan areas\nin new Member States, and certain provincial metro areas in the old members.\nInstitutional change may not suffice to help them realize this potential. Can\nsectoral policies \u2013 which are essentially a form of industrial policy \u2013 comple-\nment institutional change and help these areas fulfil their potential? Targeted\nindustrial policies have a generally poor record, and more so at the regional\nlevel. But there are cases in international development \u2013 notably in east Asian\nregions such as Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea \u2013 where policies aimed\nat \u2018jumping the technology queue\u2019 have been successful (Amsden, 1989;\nWade, 1990), so the question naturally poses itself as to whether such\nstrategies might be applicable to certain EU regions.\n1104 THOMAS FAROLE, ANDR\u00c9S RODR\u00cdGUEZ-POSE AND MICHAEL STORPER\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nAt the opposite end of the opportunity spectrum are those regions that have\nlittle short- or medium-term possibility for moving up the technological\nladder, and which suffer from problems of severe underdevelopment. Insti-\ntutional modernization will be a part of the effort in these regions. But the\nEU\u2019s other goals may also provide justification for palliative policies such as\nincome transfers and the provision of public goods that these regions, and\ntheir Member States, are unable to provide for themselves. It should be\nconsidered, however, that such programmes need to avoid creating depen-\ndence, clientelism or \u2018crowding out\u2019 developmentalist policies from the\nagenda and priorities of actors.\nA final word on how different forms of equity and cohesion interrelate is\nnecessary here. Social equity and inter-territorial equity are driven by differ-\nent forces and the one does not map onto the other. Indeed, certain types of\npolicies promoting inter-territorial equity may contribute to raising overall\nlevels of inequality between persons, if they redistribute income from persons\nin lower income brackets in one place to the population in another, without\nchanging the overall dynamics of income distribution or even redistributing\nincome upwards in the social income distribution but horizontally in the\nterritorial income distribution.\nVIII. What Might a More Territorially Nuanced Cohesion Policy\nLook Like?\nWe therefore recommend a cohesion policy consisting of a highly tailored\nset of interventions designed to address specific regional contexts of under-\ndevelopment, on the one hand, and to promote growth, on the other. In\nTable 1, the term \u2018institutional modernization\u2019 refers to the five ((a) to (e))\ngoals of institutional reform noted earlier.\nConclusions\nThe approach to cohesion policy outlined in this article departs from the\ntraditional approach to cohesion policy in three important ways. Firstly, it\nplaces less emphasis on \u2018convergence\u2019 (as defined by reducing the gap in\nGDP per capita across regions) and instead focuses on combating under-\ndevelopment in a way that promotes both local and EU growth. Secondly, it\neschews any idea of a uniform approach to regional development, recognizing\nthe need to develop interventions tailored to the contexts and needs of specific\nregions. Finally, it stresses the importance of building strong networks of\ncapable institutions in all regions in order to ensure development over the\nCOHESION POLICY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION 1105\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nTable 1: Towards a Place-Tailored Cohesion Policy\nType of region Likely location vs technological frontier\nand agglomeration potential\nNature of interventions\nto support EU cohesion\nCore metro regions (e.g.\nLondon, Paris, Berlin,\nRandstad, Hamburg,\nMilan, Copenhagen)\n\u2022 On\/near the technology frontier\n\u2022 Strong agglomeration force\n\u2022 Growth promotion (via Lisbon Agenda)\n\u2022 Facilitating ongoing adjustment and\ninnovation along the frontier\nRegions adjacent to core\nmetro regions and\nsecondary metro regions in\nthe EU\u2019s core (e.g. East\nMidlands, Scotland,\nTuscany, Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es,\nRh\u00f4ne-Alpes, Helsinki)\n\u2022 Near the technology frontier\n\u2022 Moderate potential to realize\nagglomerations\n\u2022 Promotion of endogenous innovation\ndevelopment\n\u2022 Promotion of integration with core\nmetro regions\n\u2022 Improving agglomeration potential\n(institutional deepening \u2013 e.g.\nencouraging venture capital, business\nservices, R&D institutions)\n\u2022 Essentially, these are \u2018extended\nmetropolitan basin\u2019 policies\nMetro regions (top of urban\nhierarchy) in lagging and\nperipheral areas (e.g.\nLisbon, Athens, Warsaw,\nBucharest)\n\u2022 Moderately far from the technology\nfrontier\n\u2022 Moderate potential to realize\nagglomerations in distinctive\ntechnology fields\n\u2022 Reasonable home market effect to\npromote scale\n\u2022 Institutional \u2018moving up\u2019 \u2013 e.g.\nencouraging venture capital, business\nservices, R&D institutions, etc.) \u2013\nnational level\n\u2022 Institutional modernization and\ndeepening \u2013 regional level\n\u2022 Possible targeted sectoral policies\nUnderdeveloped or\nperipheral, often\nsemi-rural regions\n(Calabria, Andalusia,\nIpeiros, Podlaskie)\n\u2022 Far from the technology frontier\n\u2022 Limited potential to realize innovative\nagglomerations\n\u2022 Limited home market effect for scale\n\u2022 Limited potential to generate productive\nactivity in the short term\n\u2022 Public goods provision \u2013 to facilitate\ndevelopment and retention of human\ncapital and home market\n\u2022 Productivity-enhancing interventions at\nthe sector\/firm level \u2013 tailored to\nexploiting local sources of comparative\nadvantage\n\u2022 Infrastructure connectivity \u2013 to link\nwith leading regions and become\nattractive to delocalizing production\nactivities\n\u2022 Institutional modernization, especially\nfor openness and co-ordination\n\u2022 Attract branch plants and\n\u2018de-agglomerating\u2019 basic\nlabour-intensive activities\nRelatively sparsely populated\nrural and peripheral\nregions (e.g. Basilicata,\nExtremadura, Alentejo,\nEast Macedonia, Upper\nNorrland, V\u00fdchodn\u00e9\nSlovensko)\n\u2022 Far from the technology frontier\n\u2022 Limited potential to realize innovative\nagglomerations\n\u2022 Limited home market effect for scale\n\u2022 Limited potential to generate productive\nactivity in the short term\n\u2022 Public goods provision\n\u2013 Quality (for equity purposes)\n\u2013 Mobility-promoting (e.g. education,\nhousing policies that avoid mobility\nrestrictions)\n\u2013 Maintain limited home market effects\n\u2022 Promoting social enterprise\/social\nentrepreneurship\n\u2022 Institutional modernization and\ndeepening for social openness\n\u2022 Innovation in niche areas suitable to\nsparsely populated regions\n\u2022 Increasing education levels and\nconnectedness to metropolitan regions\nfor knowledge transfer and opportunity\nrecognition\nSource: Authors.\n1106 THOMAS FAROLE, ANDR\u00c9S RODR\u00cdGUEZ-POSE AND MICHAEL STORPER\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nlong run. These three challenges to cohesion policy have implications for the\nway cohesion policy is governed.\nPerhaps most importantly, this approach implies a redefinition by Euro-\npean institutions and Member States and regions of the types of interventions\nto be authorized in different cases, the means to do so and the respective roles\nof the EU, Member States and sub-national regions.\n(1) Defining types of interventions: the trade-offs between growth max-\nimization through spatial unevenness and growth enhancement through\ncombating underdevelopment must be rigorously assessed and defined. Con-\ncepts such as \u2018adaptive efficiency\u2019, \u2018innovation\u2019, \u2018productive efficiency\u2019 and\n\u2018growth enhancing development\u2019 require precise definition. A further set of\ntrade-offs between these objectives and certain kinds of equity objectives \u2013\nthose necessary to assure consensus minima and to prevent \u2018downward\nspirals\u2019 \u2013 must also be assessed. Criteria that trigger each type of intervention\nthen would need to be developed.\n(2) The means to do so: in all cases, because policies need to be context-\nsensitive; their precise content has to be determined through interaction\nbetween the EU and the regions. How, then, to ensure conformity to policy\nobjectives? Greater conditionality is a must if the EU is to avoid the prob-\nlems of elite-capture, rent-seeking, insider\u2013outsider problems, principal\u2013\nagent problems or clientelistic and nepotistic practices that may arise in a\nmore decentralized cohesion policy. Although this may prove problematic at\nfirst, given the EU tradition of conditionality by consent, the EU already\nhas the powers to impose greater discretion in the allocation of funds and\nto generate a credible threat in order to make sure that regions abide by\nclear guidelines and follow set practices. Going forward, the \u2018credible\nthreat\u2019 must be shown to be credible.\n(3) Conditionality requires effective monitoring and evaluation:\ngiven the diversity of interventions we should expect under this approach, it\nis important that the Commission be able to monitor \u2013 ex ante, during and\nafter \u2013 the results of interventions, using rigorous criteria preventing the\npossibility that greater complexity and flexibility in policy objectives\nsimply open the Pandora\u2019s box of non-transparency and lead to abuse,\nrent-seeking and equivocation. This, in our view, is the greatest danger of\nthe approach we recommend. In order for this to work, there must be\nchanges both to the way the Commission functions and, critically, to the\nnature of the relationship between the Commission (DG-Regio) and its\nMember States and regions, with regard to cohesion policy. There must\nalso be significant investment in training Commission officials who will\nmonitor, and national, regional and local officials who will propose and\ncomply.\nCOHESION POLICY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION 1107\n\u00a9 2011 The Author(s)\nJCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nIn light of the above, it will be indispensable to couple a substantive\nfoundation for cohesion policy to new methods of implementation and evalu-\nation. Among the innovative measures that should receive serious consider-\nation for context-sensitive policies of the sort here advocated, we can cite\nseveral. On the new substantive foundation for cohesion policies, measures\ncould include the establishment of a set of guidelines concerning both insti-\ntutions and areas of intervention and a greater capacity by the Commission to\nprovide technical support to local institutions in the design, development and\nimplementation of economic development strategies. On the new methods of\nimplementation and evaluation side a better and leaner monitoring of perfor-\nmance through mechanisms such as peer-to-peer mentoring systems or\nrandom project monitoring could help improve the delivery and effectiveness\nof intervention. Random audits of performance are another good way to\nincrease incentives for implementing agencies, and have the advantage of\navoiding special preparation for evaluation. Such audits need to be backed up\nby independent auditing authorities, whether within the Commission or in\nseparate agencies. As a whole, this involves a more thorough development of\na \u2018check and balance structure\u2019 permitting the Commission or any designed\nindependent auditing authority fully to develop its monitoring role without\npolitical meddling, as well as providing regions with a clearer set of guide-\nlines of what is expected from the implementation of the policy. Transparency\n\u2013 \u2018sunlight\u2019 \u2013 is essential for the smooth running of the system. Finally,\npolicies could be built around incremental performance incentives rather than\nsingle block grants, such that progress towards objectives could be differen-\ntially rewarded. Obviously, audits and investigations should have the ability,\nand the incentive, to end policies and grants that are manifestly not reaching\ntheir goals.\nCorrespondence:\nAndr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez-Pose\nDepartment of Geography and Environment\nLondon School of Economics\nLondon\nUK\nemail a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk\nReferences\nAcemoglu, D.
