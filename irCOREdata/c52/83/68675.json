When applied to the soil, many of the isolated rhizobacterial strains increased seedling growth and\/or suppressed rice blast disease in greenhouse-grown plants of the cultivars Super Basmati and Azucena, but each cultivar responded to different subsets of the bacteria. In the cv Super Basmati, increased blast resistance was correlated with the production of siderophores by the rhizobacteria. Several strains inhibited the growth of the causative agent of rice blast disease, the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, in an in vitro dual culture assay. Direct bioantagonism was correlated with disease resistance in Super Basmati, but not in Azucena, and direct antagonism as a cause for the reduced disease incidence is also unlikely since no epiphytic colonisation of leaves was detected. Rhizosphere colonisation by the bacteria in plants grown in sterile sand was correlated with disease resistance in Super Basmati, but not in Azucena.

When applied to the soil, \nmany of the isolated rhizobacterial strains increased seedling growth and\/or suppressed rice \nblast disease in greenhouse-grown plants of the cultivars Super Basmati and Azucena, but \neach cultivar responded to different subsets of the bacteria. In the cv Super Basmati, \nincreased blast resistance was correlated with the production of siderophores by the \nrhizobacteria. Several strains inhibited the growth of the causative agent of rice blast disease, \nthe fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, in an in vitro dual culture assay. Direct \nbioantagonism was correlated with disease resistance in Super Basmati, but not in Azucena, \nand direct antagonism as a cause for the reduced disease incidence is also unlikely since no \nepiphytic colonisation of leaves was detected. Rhizosphere colonisation by the bacteria in \nplants grown in sterile sand was correlated with disease resistance in Super Basmati, but not \nin Azucena. As well as the differences in strains that protected each cv against blast disease, \nwe also found that there were differences in the ability of some strains to protect plants \nagainst blast depending on soil type. Hence, there are complex interactions between \nrhizobacteria and rice plants with respect to biocontrol of rice blast disease, dependent upon \nboth rice cv and soil type. The identity of strains that promoted high levels of disease \nprotection, including three that performed well across all plant cultivars and growth \nconditions, was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. \n \nKey words \nRice, rhizobacteria, siderophores, blast disease, bioantagonism, induced systemic resistance.\n 3 \n1. Introduction \nRice is one of the most important staple foods for the increasing world population, especially \nin Asia. Diseases are among the most significant limiting factors that affect rice production, \ncausing annual yield losses conservatively estimated at 5% (Song and Goodman, 2001). More \nthan 70 diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses or nematodes have been recorded on rice \n(Manandhar et al., 1998), among which rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea) is the most serious \nconstraint on high productivity (Song and Goodman, 2001). Resistant cultivars and the \napplication of pesticides have been used for blast control. However, the useful life-span of \nmany resistant cultivars is only a few years, due to the breakdown of the resistance in the face \nof high pathogenic variability of the pathogen population. The use of pesticides is costly as \nwell as environmentally undesirable. Thus, there is a need to develop strategies providing \ndurable resistance that are useful over a broad geographic area (Manandhar et al., 1998). \nAmong such new strategies, biocontrol agents appear to hold promise in blast \nmanagement. Since biological control is a key component of integrated disease management, \nit is important to search for plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) active against blast \nand to evaluate these antagonists for application in field conditions. Many microorganisms \nfrom the rhizosphere can positively influence plant growth and plant health and are referred \nto as PGPR (Compant et al., 2005). These microbes can act as biocontrol agents in several \nways, including niche exclusion, bioantagonism and induction of induced systemic resistance \n(ISR) against infection by fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens in different plant species \n(Compant et al., 2005). The mechanisms by which PGPR activate ISR are not yet understood, \nbut it is clear that there is substantial variation between different microbes and plants. A \nrange of different molecules have been identified as elicitors of ISR in different systems, \nincluding conserved effectors such as flagellar peptides and lipopolysaccharides, as well as \nantibiotics, cyclic lipopeptides and siderophores (Compant et al., 2005; Van Wees et al., \n 4 \n2008). The ability to secrete siderophores into the environment is an important feature of \nmany PGPR. Siderophores are iron-chelating compounds that many microbes use to acquire \niron from the soil. Siderophore-producing bacteria are able to out-compete other soil \nmicrobes, providing one mechanism for their bioantagonistic properties (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, \n1999). In addition, siderophores have been identified as molecules able to activate ISR in \nseveral plant species, providing a second mechanism for protection of plants against disease \nby siderophore-producing PGPR (Leeman et al., 1996a; Audenaert et al., 2002; Meziane et \nal., 2005). Recently, the siderophore pseudobactin was found to be an important determinant \nof ISR against blast disease in rice (De Vleesschauwer et al., 2008). \nWe are working towards commercial development of PGPR as a method for both \nplant growth promotion and biocontrol. Many greenhouse studies (Kaiser et al., 1989; \nMontealegre et al., 2003) and field experiments (Kazempour, 2004) have been conducted to \nshow the efficacy of PGPR in disease management, but there are still relatively few \ncommercial applications of PGPR for this purpose. Here, we report on the selection of PGPR \nstrains for suppression of rice blast disease, and show that complex interactions exist between \nthe different biochemical and physiological properties of these strains and their ability to \npromote blast resistance in rice. \n \n2. Materials and methods \n2.1 Bacterial strains and growth conditions  \nBacterial strain Z2-7 had previously been isolated from rice grown in Zanzibar (Yasmin et \nal., 2004) and was taken from the BIRCEN culture collection, Plant Microbiology Division, \nNIBGE. All other strains were isolated from the roots or rhizosphere of the rice cv Super \nBasmati, cultivated in either saline or non-saline soils in the area of Shorkot, Pakistan. \nBacteria were isolated either from the rhizoplane or from roots of healthy rice plants, as \n 5 \nfollows: root pieces from rice plants were washed with tap water, placed inside tubes \ncontaining 2 mL of 0.5% MgSO4 and subjected to ultrasound at 50-55 KHz for 5 min \n(Pumarino, 1995). The bacterial suspension obtained was diluted 10-3, 10-5 and 10-7 for \nselection. For rhizospheric strains, 1 g of soil was placed in a tube containing 100 mL of \nsterile distilled water, and dilutions performed as above. For both types of samples, 0.1 mL of \neach dilution was spread on Luria Bertani (LB) agar and incubated at 28 + 2\u00baC until colony \ndevelopment was observed.  \n \n2.2 Morphological and physiological characterization  \nPurified bacterial strains were studied for colony and cell morphology using light microscopy \nand Gram staining (Vincent, 1970). Indole acetic acid (IAA) production by these bacterial \nstrains was estimated as described by Hameed et al., (2004) and P-solubilization was \nassessed on Pikovskaya\u2019s medium containing tricalcium phosphate (Pikovskaya, 1948). \n \n2.3 Nitrogenase activity  \nNitrogenase activity of bacterial strains was determined in semi-solid nitrogen-free malate \nmedium (NFM; Okon et al., 1977) by using an acetylene reduction assay (ARA) (Hardy et \nal., 1973). Pure bacterial colonies were inoculated onto NFM medium in 10 mL McCartney \nvials and incubated at 28+2 oC for 48 h. Acetylene (10% v\/v in air) was injected to the vials. \nAfter incubation for 16 h at 28+2 oC, gas samples (100 \u00b5L) were analyzed for acetylene \nreduction on a gas chromatograph (Carlo Erba-Model GC 180-series 2150) using a Porapak-\nQ column and H2 flame ionization detector. Protein estimation was carried out to measure the \nspecific activity of the cultures as described by Lowry et al., (1951). \n \n2.4 Siderophore production  \n 6 \nSiderophore production was detected using the universal chrome azurol \u2018S\u2019 (CAS) assay \n(Schwyn and Neilands, 1987). CAS plates were streaked with overnight grown cultures and \nincubated at 28+2oC for 72 h (Sharma and Johri, 2002). \n \n2.5 Hydrogen cyanide production  \nProduction of HCN was determined by modified method of Miller and Higgins (1970). \nBacterial culture (48 h) was streaked on LB amended with glycine (4.4 g L-1) and a filter \npaper soaked in 0.5% (w\/v) picric acid in 1% Na2CO3 placed in the upper lid of the Petri \nplate. After incubation at 28\u00b12\u00baC, changes in colour were examined.  \n \n2.6 Production of diffusible antibiotics  \nPotato dextrose agar plates, covered with a 0.2 \u00b5m cellophane membrane, were inoculated in \nthe centre with 100 \u00b5L of a bioantagonistic bacterial suspension (5 x 109 cfu mL-1). After \nincubation for 72 h at 28+2\u00baC, the membrane with the grown bacterial isolate was removed, \nand the plate was inoculated in the middle with a 10 mm disk of a pure culture of M. grisae. \nPlates were further incubated at 28+2\u00baC for 48 h and the growth of the pathogen (colony \nradius) was measured as the distance between the point of placement of fungal disk and \nactively growing edges of the fungus. Sterile double distilled water replaced the bacterial \nsuspension in control plates. Each experiment was run in triplicate and was repeated at least \nthree times. Results are expressed as mean % inhibition of the growth of the corresponding \nM. grisae isolate in the absence of any bacteria. Percent inhibition was calculated using the \nfollowing formula: % inhibition = (1 \u2013 [Fungal growth \/ Control growth]) x 100 \n \n2.7 Production of volatile antibiotics \n 7 \nTo check the production of volatile antibiotics, 100 \u00b5L of bacterial suspension (5x109 cfu \nmL-1), were placed at the centre of a Petri dish containing Kings\u2019 B medium, and a 10 mm \ndisk of a 4-d old pure culture of M. grisae was placed at the centre of another Petri dish \ncontaining PDA. Both half plates were placed face to face preventing any physical contact \nbetween the pathogen and the bacterial suspension. Plates were then sealed to isolate the \natmosphere inside and to prevent loss of any volatiles formed. In control plates, bacterial \nsuspension was replaced with sterile double-distilled water. Plates were incubated at 28+2\u00baC \nfor 48 h and the growth of the pathogen was measured as mentioned above and compared to \ncontrols. Experiments were run in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Results are \nexpressed as mean % inhibition of the growth of the corresponding M. grisae isolate in the \nabsence of any bacteria. Percent inhibition was calculated as above. \n \n2.8 Protease and chitinase production \nBacterial isolates were checked for production of proteases by growing them on skimmed \nmilk agar (SKM) as described by Kazempour (2004). An ability to clear the skimmed milk \nsuspension in the agar was taken as evidence of the secretion of proteases. To assay the \nproduction of chitinases, bacteria were grown on medium containing chitin as the sole carbon \nsource (Montealegre et al., 2003). \n \n2.9 Pathogenicity of bacteria \nIn order to test whether bacteria were pathogenic to rice plants, seeds were immersed in a \nsuspension of the antagonistic bacteria (5x109 cfu mL-1) for 5 min (Raupach and Kloepper, \n1998). Sterile distilled water was used as a control. Once treated, seeds were germinated in \nautoclaved soil. Seedlings were maintained under glasshouse conditions at 25-28\u00baC with \ndaily watering with the addition of fertilizers. Height, number of leaves, and fresh weights \n 8 \nwere measured after 30 d. Experiments were repeated six times. Data was analyzed using the \nDuncan Multiple Test to test for significant differences. \n \n2.10 Dual culture antagonism assays \nM. grisea isolate Ch155 was originally collected in China by Professor Shen at the Chinese \nNational Rice Research Institute and distributed by Didier Tharreau, CIRAD, Montpellier, \nFrance. A 10 mm disk of a pure culture of M. grisea grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) \nwas placed at the centre of a Petri dish containing PDA. A circular inoculum, made with a 6 \ncm diameter Petri dish dipped in a suspension of bacteria (5x109 cfu mL-1), was placed \nsurrounding the fungal culture. Plates were cultured for 72 h at 28 + 2\u00baC and growth diameter \nof the pathogen (distance between the point of placement of fungal disk and actively growing \nedges of the fungus) was measured and compared to control growth where the bacterial \nsuspension was replaced by sterile distilled water. Each experiment considering a single \nbacterial isolate was run in triplicate and was repeated at least three times. Results are \nexpressed as mean % inhibition of the growth of the corresponding M. grisea isolate in the \nabsence of any bacteria.  \nPercent inhibition was calculated as above. \n \n2.11 Disease resistance in greenhouse-grown rice plants \nPGPR inoculations. Rice seeds (cvs Super Basmati and Azucena) were sterilised and \ngerminated on moist filter paper in sterile Petri dishes. Ten days after germination, three \nseedlings were transplanted to each pot (25 cm diameter) containing autoclaved soil. Plants \nwere kept in the greenhouse at a temperature of 28 + 2\u00baC during the day and 25 + 2\u00baC at night \nfor 40 d. For inoculation of plants, bacterial cultures were grown in LB broth for 24-48 h at \n28 + 2\u00baC. Cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 6000 x g for 5 min, washed and \n 9 \nresuspended in sterile water. Soils in which seedlings were growing were inoculated with 1 \nmL of bacterial suspension (108 - 109 cells mL-1) of individual strains and plants left for 7 d \nunder standard conditions. Parallel experiments were performed in which plants were grown \nin autoclaved sand rather than soil. Plants were grown in same conditions, watered regularly \nwith autoclaved water and were given \u00bc strength Hoagland\u2019s solution for nutritional \nrequirements. \nChallenge inoculation. The blast fungus was cultured on rice flour agar (20 g L-1 rice flour, \n2.5 g L-1 yeast extract 1.5% agar) and incubated at 25oC under fluorescent lights with a 12 h \nphotoperiod for 2-3 weeks. Spores of the fungus were harvested by flooding the agar plate \ncultures with 5-7 mL sterile water containing 0.5% gelatine, filtered through 0.2 \u00b5m nylon \nmeshes and transferred immediately to a container containing ice to prevent spore \ngermination. Spore concentration was adjusted to 1x105 spores mL-1.  \n40-d-old rice plants of all of the treatments and control were transferred to the \ninoculation chamber 1 d before the inoculation to acclimatize the new environment (28 \u00b1 5oC \nday and 25 \u00b1 5oC night temperature and relative humidity above 90%). About 100 mL of the \nfungal spore inoculum was sprayed over the plants in the evening. Immediately after \ninoculation, the plants were covered with a polythene hood and black polythene sheets for 24 \nh to stimulate infection in the dark. Each experiment included five replicates per treatment \nand three plants per replicate. \nDisease assessment. Six days after fungal inoculation, each plant was assessed individually \nfor blast infection. Each leaf was scored for number and size of lesions. Disease incidence \nwas evaluated according to a lesion index: small brown spots (R; lesion diameter < 2mm), \nsmall brown lesion encircled by a whitish zone (RS; 2 mm \u2264 lesion diameter < 5mm), small \nwhitish lesion encircled by a brown zone (MS; 2 mm \u2264 lesion diameter < 5mm) and large  \nlesion (S; 5 mm \u2264 lesion diameter ), and disease index = {(1\u00d7nR + 2 \u00d7 nRS  + 3\u00d7nMS+ \n 10 \n4\u00d7nS) \u00f7 number of seedlings} (Someya et al., 2002). The experiment was carried out \nindependently on three occasions using a completely randomized block design with six \nreplications for each treatment. Mean disease index (MDI) data from each replicated \nexperiment was analysed by two-way ANOVA with strain and cv as the two factors. \nAfter initial disease scoring, plants were kept under normal greenhouse conditions for \nanother period of 40 d, and then percentage survival of the plants was calculated. \n \n2.12 Ephipytic and rhizospheric colonization by bacteria \nLeaf and root apex samples from 45 rice plants grown in sand inoculated with each bacterial \nstrain were taken 7, 25 and 45 d after inoculation to check for ephiphytic and rhizospheric \ncolonization of bacteria. Leaf and root extracts were made and serial dilutions of 10-3, 10-5 \nand 10-7 were made for selection of bacteria. For both types of samples, 0.1 mL of each \ndilution was placed on Luria Bertani (LB) agar and incubated at 28 + 2\u00baC for 48-72 h or until \ncolony development was observed.  \n \n2.13 Partial 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing \nDNA was extracted from selected bacterial isolates (DNeasy Tissue kit, QIAGEN) and used \nto amplify a fragment of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (Yang et al., 1985) using universal \nprimers Y1 and Y2. The forward primer Y1 (5\u2032-TGGCTCAGAACGAACGCTGGCGGC-3\u2032) \ncorresponds to positions 20-43 in the Escherichia coli 16S rRNA sequence (Young et al., \n1991), and the reverse primer Y2 (5\u2032-CCCACTGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3\u2032) corresponds \nto position 361-338 of the gene. Each 50 \u00b5L PCR reaction mixture contained 0.2 \u00b5L of Taq \nDNA Polymerase (50 U \u00b5L-1;  Promega), 5 \u00b5L 10x PCR buffer, 4 \u00b5L 2.5 mM dNTPs, 1 \u00b5L \nof each primer (100 ng \u00b5L-1) and 1\u00b5L template DNA (12.5 ng \u00b5L-1) and underwent 35 rounds \nof temperature cycling (94oC for 1 min, 50oC for 2 min and 72oC for 3 min). This was \n 11 \nfollowed by incubation at 72oC for 7 min. PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR \nPurification Spin kits (QIAGEN) and directly used for sequence analysis (Lancaster \nUniversity Sequencing Facility). The sequences obtained were searched on BlastX \n(http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/BLAST\/).  Sequences were deposited in the EMBL gene bank \ndatabase. \n \n3. Results  \n3.1 Isolation of bacterial strains \nA total of 16 bacterial strains isolated from the rhizosphere and roots of rice cultivated in \nnormal and saline soils from Shorkot in Pakistan were selected for detailed investigation. \nSpecies diversity investigation amongst these, indicated that they likely belong to a range of \ndifferent bacterial genera, including Enterobacter, Bacillus and Pseudomonas, as they \nshowed morphological characteristics most closely resembling these genera (Farmer et al., \n1992; Grimont and Grimont 1992; Hassan et al., 1998). \n \nDifferent strains exhibited different combinations of properties for nitrogen fixation, P \nsolubilization, and the production of siderophores, IAA, proteases, chitinases and HCN. \nAlthough only one strain (SPR7) showed HCN production, none were positive for N fixation. \nThe data are summarized in Table 1.  \n \n3.2 Pathogenicity and effects of bacteria on plant growth \nNo signs of pathogenicity, such as lesion formation or wilting were observed in the seedlings \nthat had been incubated with bacterial cultures. Significant differences were observed in plant \ngrowth promotion effects on both shoot fresh weights and seedling height by the bacteria in \ninoculated seedlings of both cultivars after one month (Table 2). \n 12 \n \n3.3 Disease suppression in greenhouse-grown plants \nWhen bacterial cultures were applied to the soil 7 d prior to pathogen inoculation, isolates \nBPS10, SPR4, WBPS1, Z2-7, SPS2, SPR5 and WBPR4 reduced the disease index to a range \nof 7.5% to 27.5% relative to controls in Azucena (Table 3). In Super Basmati plants, bacterial \nisolates WBPS1, BPS12, Z2-7, SPS2 and WBPS2 reduced the disease index to a range of \n17.5 % to 40 % compared to control plants in the absence of PGPR (Table 3). Other isolates \nhad smaller effects, but no strain tested failed to provide protection in at least one cv. \nStatistical analysis using two-way ANOVA indicated that both bacterial strain (F = 309, P < \n0.0001) and plant cv (F = 1280, P < 0.0001) affect the level of disease, and that there is also a \nsignificant interaction between strain and cv (F = 190, P < 0.0001). This latter result suggests \nthat the two cvs respond differently to the bacterial strains. \n \nTo investigate the source of this difference, we performed point biserial correlation analysis \nto examine possible relationships between the production of antibiotics, siderophores and \nhydrolytic enzymes, and disease resistance in the two rice cvs. The results indicate that blast \nresistance in Super Basmati is correlated with siderophore production (rpb = -0.59; P = 0.015), \nbut not in Azucena (rpb = -0.3; P = 0.254), suggesting that this difference may account, at least \nin part, for the interaction identified in the ANOVA analysis. These relationships are \nillustrated in Fig. 1, which also shows that in general, more strains were able to reduce \ndisease indices, and to a greater degree, in Azucena plants than in Super Basmati, irrespective \nof their ability to produce siderophores. There was no significant correlation between blast \nresistance and the production of antibiotics, chitinases or proteases by the bacteria. \n \n 13 \nAfter initial scoring for disease, plants were kept for a further period of 40 d under normal \ngrowth conditions to see whether or not plants that initially showed disease symptoms \nrecovered over time. Super Basmati plants inoculated with bacterial strains SPR7, SPR5, \nSPR4, WBPR4 and BPS10, which initially showed high disease incidence, were found to \nrecover almost completely from the disease, whereas un-inoculated control plants were \nalmost dead at that time. Similarly, in the case of rice cv Azucena, plants treated with \nbacterial strains WBPS1 and WBPS5 which were initially highly infected, showed 80% \nrecovery after 40 d of challenge inoculation with blast fungus (Table 4). \n \n3.4 Bioantagonistic activity against M. grisea \nIn the dual culture assays (Fig. 2) many of the bacterial strains significantly inhibited fungal \ngrowth over a period of 28 d (Table 3). Bacterial strains SPS2 and WBPR2 remained \nantagonistic at a level of 100 % even after 40 d of assay. No physical contact was observed \nbetween any of the bacteria tested and M. grisea; moreover, an inhibitory halo was observed \nin the case of a few bacterial strains, suggesting the presence of fungistatic metabolites \nsecreted by the bacteria. With bacterial strain SPS2, production of spores around the fungus \ncausing complete fungal lysis was observed (Fig. 2). The bacterial strains were further \ninvestigated for production of volatile and diffusible antibiotics, which may provide them \nwith bioantagonistic properties. Strains SPS2, Z2-7, WBPR2 and SPR7 produced both \nvolatile and diffusible antibiotics, whilst BPS10 produced diffusible antibiotics only (Table \n3). There appeared to be a strong association between siderophore production and in vitro \nantagonism (Fig. 3), which was confirmed by point biserial correlation analysis (rpb = 0.88; P \n< 0.0001). There was also a significant, albeit weaker correlation, between antibiotic \nproduction and antagonism (Fig. 3; rpb = 0.56; P = 0.023). On the other hand, there was no \ncorrelation between antagonism and either chitinase (rpb = -0.31; P = 0.246) or protease (rpb = \n 14 \n-0.13; P = 0.639) production. Since the majority of strains exhibited bioantagonistic activity \nagainst M. grisea, we plotted disease index against bioantagonism for Super Basmati and \nAzucena (Fig 4). There was a significant correlation between in vitro antagonism and the \nsuppression of blast disease in Super Basmati, but not in Azucena. Hence, direct antagonistic \nactivity cannot account for the disease suppressing activity of the PGPR strains in both rice \ncvs tested. \n \n3.5 Ephiphytic and rhizospheric colonization. \nTo investigate colonisation of both roots and shoots of rice plants by our selected bacterial \nstrains, we performed an experiment on plants grown in sterile sand, since we had no way of \nidentifying the applied PGPR from amongst the microbial populations in the soil used in the \nfirst experiment. None of the bacterial strains were found to colonize plant leaf surfaces, \nsuggesting that direct bioantagonistic activity is not a contributing factor to the reduction in \nblast disease incidence. Table 5 shows the levels of rhizospheric colonisation by the different \nstrains at different times after soil inoculation. Bacterial populations varied considerably \nbetween strains, but colonisation by each strain (with the exception of WBPS5), was similar \nfor both rice cvs. Bacterial population density for bacterial strains Z2-7, SPR7, SPR4, SPR5, \nSPS2 and WBPS1 remained high throughout the experiment in roots of both rice cvs, while \nthat of the rest of the bacterial strains decreased substantially over time. We reasoned that \npersistence of the strains in the rhizosphere may account in part for the varied level of disease \nsuppression between different PGPR treatments. Hence, disease indices were calculated \nfollowing blast infection of PGPR-inoculated sand-grown plants as before. Although in \ngeneral, the degree of disease protection afforded by the PGPR in sand was less than that \nobserved for soil-grown plants, there was a similar effect of each strain on plants grown both \nin sand and soil. There were some exceptions to this in the case of Azucena, where strains \n 15 \nSPR4, WBPS3 and WBPR2, showed substantial differences in the level of disease \nsuppression in soil compared to sand. When we examined the relationship between \ncolonisation and blast disease, we found a significant correlation between rhizosphere \ncolonisation (at 25 d) and disease index for Super Basmati (Pearson r = -0.62; P = 0.01), but \nnot for Azucena (Pearson r = 0.057; P = 0.83). \n \n3.6 Species identification by partial 16S rRNA sequencing \nBacterial isolates that were found to be most effective in controlling rice blast both in vitro \nand in vivo (SPS2, BPS10, BPS12, Z2-7, SPR4, SPR5 and SPR7), were identified using \npartial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The sequences obtained were compared with those in \npublic databanks, and on the basis of similarities with existing sequences, we were able to \nidentify most isolates at least to the genus level, as shown in Table 1. \n \n4. Discussion \nA variety of bioantagonistic bacteria, including members of the genera Azospirillum, \nAzotobacter, Azoarcus, Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Enterobacter, are known to colonize the \nrhizosphere of most of the cereals, including maize, rice and wheat, and can be used as plant \ngrowth promoters and biocontrol agents (Reinhold-Hurek et al., 1993; Betelho et al., 1998; \nNaureen et al., 2005). The scope of this investigation was to isolate, characterize and select \nnovel bacteria from the rice rhizosphere with potentially useful capabilities in terms of plant \ngrowth promotion and biological suppression of one of the most devastating rice pathogens, \nM. grisea. Rice disease suppression by biocontrol agents is governed by a multitude of \nfactors. The influence of these factors varies with the type of biocontrol agent, plant cultivar \nand the nature of the pathogen targeted for control (Schroth and Hancock, 1981). There are \ndifferent modes of action of biocontrol bacteria, such as inhibition of the pathogen by \n 16 \nantimicrobial compounds (antibiosis), competition for iron through production of \nsiderophores (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1999), parasitism that may involve production of \nextracellular enzymes, (for example, chitinases and proteases that can lyse pathogen cell \nwalls), and induction of plant resistance mechanisms (Whipps, 2001).  \n \nHere, we have identified new strains from a range of bacterial species with potential as \nbiocontrol agents based on their ability to suppress the incidence of rice blast when they were \napplied to the roots. Many of the strains tested also show direct bioantagonistic activity \nagainst the rice blast fungus, M. grisea, which correlates with their ability to produce \nsiderophores and antibiotics. Several of the strains also produce hydrolytic enzymes, which \nare also likely to play a role in direct antagonism (Ordentlick et al., 1988; Chernin and Chet, \n2002; Kamensky et al., 2003). Epiphytic colonisation assays, however, suggest that under the \nconditions tested, there is likely to be no physical contact between the bioantagonistic \nbacteria and the pathogen on leaf surfaces. This suggests the induction of systemic resistance \nin rice by these bacterial strains. Induced systemic resistance (ISR) is a phenomenon whereby \ndisease resistance against foliar pathogens is enhanced by rhizospheric bacteria or other \nantagonists which are spatially separated from the pathogen (van Loon et al., 1998). ISR has \nbeen recognised in a number of plant species, including radish (Raphanus sativus L.; Leeman \net al., 1996b), Arabidopsis (van Wees et al., 1997), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.; Chen et \nal., 1998), carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L.; van Peer et al., 1991), and tomato (Solanum \nlycopersicum; Duijff et al., 1997). In rice, several bacterial strains have previously been \nidentified that improve rice blast resistance, (Krishnamurthy and Gnanamanickam 1998, \nSomeya et al. 2002, Yang et al. 2008, De Vleesschauwer et al. 2008). Our study substantially \nexpands the collection, and it will now be of interest to investigate the molecular and cellular \n 17 \nresponses of rice plants to inoculation with our PGPR strains and their subsequent responses \nto blast infection to confirm the involvement of ISR in the suppression of blast disease. \n \nInterestingly, siderophore production was correlated with blast resistance in soil-grown cv \nSuper Basmati plants, but not in cv Azucena. No significant correlation was found between \ndisease index and either antibiotic, chitinase or protease production. Iron availability and \nsiderophore production have previously been identified as important determinants of ISR in \nseveral other systems, (Leeman et al., 1996a; Press et al., 1997; Audenaert et al., 2002; \nMeziane et al., 2005). Notably, it was found recently that the pseudobactin siderophore of P. \nfluorescens WCS374r is required for the establishment of ISR against rice blast disease (De \nVleesschauwer et al. 2008). It will be of interest in the future to identify the siderophores \nproduced by our new strains, and to characterise their effects on plants and microbes in more \ndetail. However, it is clear that siderophores are not a primary determinant of the biocontrol \npotential of the PGPR tested, since there is no correlation between siderophore production \nand blast disease in Azucena. Indeed, the ability of individual strains to provide protection \nagainst blast disease varied considerably between the two cultivars, indicating a complex \ninteraction between the PGPR and different rice cultivars. Inter- and intraspecific variation in \nplant ISR responses to PGPR is something which is commonly observed (van Loon, 1997). \n \nThe different levels of disease suppression in both rice cultivars grown in soil and sand might \nbe due to the different colonization pattern and secretion of secondary metabolites by the \nrhizobacteria. Root colonization is a key factor contributing to the performance of bacterial \ninoculants - an introduced strain can only be effective in promoting plant growth and \nbiocontrol activity if it is capable of associating with the roots of the plant (Goddard et al. \n2001). In the present study, most of the bacterial strains were found to colonize well in the \n 18 \nrhizosphere of both of the rice cultivars. In general bacterial strains Z2-7, SPR4, SPR5 SPR7, \nSPS2 and WBPS1 were found to persist better than the other strains, and this might be the \nreason for the better performance of these bacteria in controlling blast disease and enhancing \nplant health. The persistence of these strains could be attributed to siderophore production, \nsince the soil iron concentration during the experiment was as low as 5 ug g-1(data not \nshown). However, as indicated above, the situation is likely to be more complex than this, \nsince whilst disease incidence, siderophore production and rhizosphere colonisation are all \ncorrelated in the case of Super Basmati, they are not for Azucena. \n \nSome additional important capabilities of practical utility shown by some of these bacterial \nisolates were IAA production and P-solubilization, which suggested that these bacteria could \nbe used as plant growth promoters (Paulina et al., 2001; Naureen et al., 2005). These \nproperties might be responsible for the significant differences in seedling growth provided by \nthe different bacterial strains, and suggests that these bacteria could be used as inoculants for \nrice to improve plant health and yield. Almost all of the bacterial strains were found to \npromote seedling growth (height and fresh weight) compared to control plants, but \ninterestingly, bacterial strains that most improved seedling growth in Super Basmati were not \nas effective on Azucena plants, and vice versa. As for the promotion of disease resistance, this \nmay be because bacterial association with roots of different plant cultivars is not only strain \nand species-specific, but also depends largely upon root exudates (Korhoenon et al., 1986; \nNaureen et al., 2005). \n \nThe use of natural or genetically modified micro-organisms as soil inocula for the \ndevelopment of sustainable cropping systems is a promising area for development. However, \nthe successful release and application of PGPR in the field has been impeded partly because \n 19 \nsoil is a complex matrix that is difficult to manipulate with respect to environment and \nindigenous microbial populations. Soil type has been found to affect the ability of PGPR to \ncolonize the rhizosphere or root-soil interface, and can account for the varying performance \nof PGPR in different systems (Suslow and Schroth, 1982; Horwarth et al., 1998). During our \nresearch, we also observed a difference in performance of various bacterial strains in \npromoting growth and controlling blast in plants grown in soil versus sand. Higher disease \nincidences were observed in plants grown in sand compared to soil, particularly for Super \nBasmati. However, the plants survived more than 46 d, which was similar to the plants grown \nin soil.  In the case of Azucena, some strains had very different impacts on disease, depending \nwhether plants were grown in soil or sand, consistent with the fact that plant-inoculum \ninteractions can be strongly influenced by soil type (Horwarth et al., 1998). This could be due \nto difference in soil texture, availability of nutrients and colonization pattern of the bacterial \nstrains in the roots in the two soil types used (Goddard et al. 2001). Soil quality factors and \ncarrier delivery systems should be important considerations in field trials to evaluating the \nperformance of bacterial inoculants for agricultural applications. Strains SPS2, WBPS1 and \nZ2-7 reported here provided high levels of blast protection across all plant cultivars and \ngrowth substrates tested, and are therefore good candidates for such trials. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe are grateful to the Pakistan Higher Education Commission for the award of a PhD \nstudentship to Zakira Naureen.
