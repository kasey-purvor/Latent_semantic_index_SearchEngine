It was the site of the 18,000 km Terra Australis orogen, 18 \nwhich was initiated in Neoproterozoic times with the break-up of Rodinia, and 19 \nevolved into the Mesozoic Australides. The Gondwana margin was completed, in Late 20 \nCambrian times, by closure of the Adamastor Ocean (between Brazilian and 21 \nsouthwest African components) and the Mozambique Ocean (between East and West 22 \nGondwana), forming the Brasiliano\u2013Pan-African mobile belts. During the Early 23 \nPalaeozoic much of the southern margin was dominated by successive episodes of 24 \nsubduction-accretion.  Eastern Australia, Northern Victoria Land and the 25 \nTransantarctic Mountains were affected by one of the first of these events \u2013 the Late 26 \nCambrian Ross\/Delamerian orogeny, remnants of which may be found in the 27 \nAntarctic Peninsula \u2013 but also contain two accreted terranes of unknown age and 28 \norigin. Similar events are recognized at the South American end of the margin, where 29 \nthe Cambrian Pampean orogeny occurred with dextral strike-slip along the western 30 \nedge of the R\u00edo de la Plata craton, followed by an Ordovician active margin 31 \n(Famatinian) associated with the collision of the Precordillera terrane. However, the 32 \n 2\ncentral part of the margin (the Sierra de la Ventana of eastern Argentina, the Cape 33 \nFold Belt of South Africa and the Ellsworth Mountains of West Antarctica) seem to 34 \nrepresent a passive margin during the Early Palaeozoic, with the accumulation of 35 \npredominantly reworked continental sedimentary deposits (Du Toit\u2019s \u2018Samfrau 36 \nGeosyncline\u2019). In many of the outer areas, accretion and intense granitic\/rhyolitic 37 \nmagmatism continued during the Late Palaeozoic, with collision of several small 38 \ncontinental terranes, many of which are nevertheless of Gondwana origin: e.g., 39 \nsouthern Patagonia and (possibly) \u2018Chilenia\u2019 in the South American\u2013South African 40 \nsectors, and the Western Province and Median Batholith terranes of New Zealand. 41 \nThe rhyolitic Permo\u2013Triassic LIP of southern South America represents a Permo-42 \nTriassic switch to extensional tectonics, which continued into the early Jurassic, and 43 \nwas followed by the establishment of the Andean subduction margin. Elsewhere at 44 \nthis time the margin largely became passive, with terrane accretion continuing in New 45 \nZealand.

Introduction 76 \n 77 \nThe oceanic margin of Gondwana was of the order of 40,000 km long (Fig. 1).  Its 78 \nnorthern boundary was the source of Avalonian and Cadomian terranes in the west 79 \nand Cimmerian terranes in the east (Unrug, 1997).  Its southern margin has been 80 \nproposed as one of the largest and longest-lived accretionary orogens on Earth 81 \n(Cawood, 2005; Vaughan et al., 2005b) - the Proterozoic and Palaeozoic Terra 82 \nAustralis orogen (Cawood, 2005), which evolved into the Australides (Vaughan et al., 83 \n2005b) during the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic. This orogen was over 18000 kilometres 84 \nlong, incorporating margins against the Iapetus and palaeo-Pacific oceans (Unrug, 85 \n1997) (Fig. 1), and is comparable in scale to the Late Palaeozoic 86 \nAlleghenian\/Hercynian\/Uralian orogen of central Pangaea (Vaughan et al., 2005b).  87 \nToday, the southern margin of Gondwana can be subdivided into Australian, Victoria 88 \nLand, New Zealand, West Antarctic, South African and South American sectors 89 \n(Figure 1).  Apart from the West Antarctic and South African sectors, these have 90 \n 4\nrecently been reviewed in a Geological Society Special Publication (Vaughan et al., 91 \n2005a).  The present paper focuses on the Iapetus and palaeo-Pacific margin of West 92 \nGondwana (Fig. 1), i.e. the West Antarctic and South American sectors; it does not 93 \ndeal with the collisional margin between East and West Gondwana, nor with the 94 \nAvalonian\/Cadomian or Cimmerian margins (Fig. 1).  However, it does touch on the 95 \nNew Zealand and Victoria Land sectors (including the Transantarctic Mountains) of 96 \nthe margin of East Gondwana, as these may have contributed detrital material and 97 \nterranes to the accretionary margin of West Gondwana from Palaeozoic times 98 \nonwards. 99 \n 100 \nMoving clockwise along the southern margin of Gondwana, from modern-day east to 101 \nwest (Figure 1), starting in East Gondwana, the Phanerozoic history of the Victoria 102 \nLand sector of the margin has recently been reviewed by Tessensohn and Henjes-103 \nKunst (2005) and the New Zealand sector has had recent and comprehensive reviews 104 \nby Mortimer (2004) and Wandres and Bradshaw (2005). Moving into West 105 \nGondwana, aspects of the West Antarctic sector have been reviewed in the past 10 106 \nyears by Pankhurst et al. (1998b) and Vaughan and Storey (2000), but is a sector of 107 \nthe margin in need of an up-to-date treatment. Rapalini (2005) reviewed the southern 108 \nSouth American sector of the margin from the latest Proterozoic to the late Palaeozoic 109 \non the basis of palaeomagnetic data, and a brief review of this sector was presented in 110 \nVaughan et al. (2005b), but an up-to-date comprehensive review of the whole South 111 \nAmerican sector is lacking. Given the pace of recent developments (e.g., Casquet et 112 \nal., 2006; Pankhurst et al., 2006), and the considerable controversy over the 113 \nPalaeozoic history of this sector of the margin, particularly regarding the origin of the 114 \n 5\nPrecordillera or Cuyania terrane (e.g., Thomas and Astini, 2003; Finney et al., 2005), 115 \na further review is appropriate. 116 \n 117 \n2. What is West Gondwana? 118 \nIn simple terms West Gondwana is that part of the supercontinent represented today in 119 \nSouth America, Arabia, Africa and West Antarctica.  From a geological point of view, 120 \nhowever, this definition is over-simplified and it reflects a subdivision based on the 121 \nbreak-up rather than the amalgamation configuration of the supercontinent (e.g., 122 \nStorey et al., 1996; Veevers, 2004).  The earliest geologically-based separation of 123 \nGondwana into eastern and western parts was made by Du Toit (1937) (Fig. 2).  He 124 \nfurther separated Antarctica into eastern and western parts, as suggested by Suess 125 \n(1883\u20131901), assigning them to East and West Gondwana, respectively (see Thomson 126 \nand Vaughan (2005) for a brief discussion), but placed New Zealand in East 127 \nGondwana, off the eastern coast of Australia (Fig. 2).  More recently, West Gondwana 128 \nhas been defined on the basis of the Archaean shields, cratons and cratonic fragments, 129 \nthe intervening Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic mobile belts, and the outer belts 130 \nof Proterozoic\u2013Mesozoic terranes that make it up (e.g., Unrug, 1997; Pankhurst et al., 131 \n1998b; Brito Neves et al., 1999; Vaughan and Storey, 2000; Murphy et al., 2004; 132 \nTohver et al., 2006).   133 \n 134 \n2.1 Cratonic elements 135 \n 136 \nThe major cratonic elements comprise the Amazonia-West Africa craton, Sao 137 \nFrancisco-Congo craton, Kalahari\u2013Grunehogna craton, R\u00edo de la Plata craton, and the 138 \nArabian\u2013Nubian shield (Tohver et al., 2006) (Fig. 3).  Cordani et al. (2003) pointed 139 \n 6\nout that there are smaller cratonic fragments of considerable importance in 140 \nunderstanding the evolution of the supercontinent.  These include the Central Goias 141 \nmassif (Fischel et al., 2001), the Luiz Alves, R\u00edo Apa, Sao Luis and Paran\u00e1 cratonic 142 \nfragments (e.g., Tohver et al., 2006) (Fig. 3).  The Hoggar\u2013Potiguar plate of Brito 143 \nNeves et al. (1999) is another potential cratonic fragment (e.g., Liegeois et al., 2003; 144 \nOuzegane et al., 2003), although its limits are not currently delineated. 145 \n 146 \n2.2 Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic mobile belts 147 \n 148 \nBrito Neves et al. (1999) used the term Brasiliano\u2013Pan African collage for the 149 \nMesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic\u2013Cambrian mobile belts involved in the final 150 \namalgamation of West Gondwana.  Tohver et al. (2006) listed 19 individual belts to 151 \nthis collage, illustrated in Figure 3.  Brito Neves et al. (1999) summarized them as the 152 \nNeoproterozoic Borborema\/Trans-Saharan and Tocantins belts, and the 153 \nNeoproterozoic\u2013Cambrian Pampean and Mantiqueira belts in modern-day South 154 \nAmerica, and, in modern-day Africa, the Neoproterozoic Dahomeyide belt and the 155 \nNeoproterozoic\u2013Cambrian Damara, and Zambesi belts.  Other important parts of 156 \nNeoproterozoic\u2013Cambrian West Gondwana include the Cariris-Velhos terrane (Brito 157 \nNeves et al., 1999) of northern South America\u2013East Africa and the \"Grenville\" 158 \nNeoproterozoic rocks of the Haag Nunataks block of West Antarctica and the 159 \nFalklands Plateau (e.g., Storey et al., 1994; Wareham et al., 1998).   160 \n 161 \n2.3 Palaeozoic\u2013Mesozoic terranes 162 \n 163 \n 7\nAccretion of new terrane material to Gondwana was active during amalgamation 164 \n(Cawood, 2005) and continued until the late stages of break-up of the supercontinent 165 \n(e.g., Vaughan et al., 2002b).  In the Phanerozoic, these include the Cambrian rocks of 166 \nthe Ellsworth\u2013Whitmore Mountains block of West Antarctica (e.g., Curtis et al., 167 \n1999), and the Cambrian rocks of the Western Province of New Zealand (M\u00fcnker and 168 \nCooper, 1995). Various Proterozoic fragments of West Gondwana also became part of 169 \nthe margins of the Laurentia and Baltica cratons (Skehan, 1997).  Murphy et al. 170 \n(2004) reviewed these and summarized them as being formed either of reworked 171 \nNeoproterozoic \"juvenile crust within the Panthalassa-type ocean surrounding 172 \nRodinia\", the so-called Avalonian-type terranes, or of reworked West African 173 \nPalaeoproterozoic crust, the so-called Cadomian-type terranes.  Following 174 \namalgamation, the Gondwana margin continued to be active with addition of new 175 \noceanic material (e.g., Cawood et al., 2002) and remobilization of existing parts of the 176 \nmargin by strike-slip faulting (e.g., Cawood, 2005).  Major episodes of terrane 177 \naddition and remobilization occurred during the Gondwanan Orogeny of the Permo-178 \nCarboniferous (e.g., Cawood, 2005; Pankhurst et al., 2006) and during global 179 \norogenesis in the Triassic\u2013Jurassic and Cretaceous (e.g., Vaughan and Livermore, 180 \n2005). 181 \n 182 \n2.4 Boundary with East Gondwana 183 \n 184 \nThe boundary with East Gondwana consists of a meandering zone of late 185 \nNeoproterozoic to earliest Cambrian orogenic and mobile belts, termed Pan-African, 186 \nextending from and including the Arabian\u2013Nubian Shield in the north to Antarctica in 187 \nthe south (e.g., Shackleton, 1996).  Perhaps the most important of these belts is that of 188 \n 8\nthe East African\u2013Antarctic orogeny (Jacobs and Thomas, 2004).  Unrug (1997) shows 189 \na very broad zone of potential convergence in the northern segment, which include 190 \neastern Africa and the Arabian\u2013Nubian Shield.  The southernmost extent of this 191 \ncollision zone includes the Namaqua\u2013Natal\u2013Maud belt on the margin of the Kalahari\u2013192 \nGrunehogna craton in southern Africa and Dronning Maud Land in East Antarctica 193 \n(Jacobs et al., 2003).  The essentially synchronous collision Brasiliano zone is the 194 \nsubject of a new survey of geological links across the present South Atlantic region 195 \n(Pankhurst et al., in press). 196 \n 197 \n3. The formation and dispersal of West Gondwana 198 \n 199 \nFormation of the Gondwana supercontinent appears to have overlapped with the 200 \nbreak-up of Rodinia (a possible supercontinent built around Laurentia), which 201 \noccurred between 1000 and 750 million years ago (e.g. Cordani et al., 2003; Meert 202 \nand Torsvik, 2003).  The series of accretionary and collisional events that formed 203 \nWest Gondwana began 850 million years ago and were complete by the latest 204 \nCambrian (490 million years ago) (e.g., Brito Neves et al., 1999).  It is overly 205 \nsimplistic to think of the final formation of Gondwana in terms of a collision between 206 \nthe East and West parts (e.g., Meert, 2001).  Recent palaeomagnetic data (Tohver et 207 \nal., 2006) suggest that prior to final amalgamation of Gondwana in the mid-Cambrian, 208 \nthe Amazon\u2013West Africa block of West Gondwana was still a separate entity from 209 \nRodinia, and was separated from other blocks that constitute West Gondwana 210 \n(Congo\u2013S\u00e3o Francisco\u2013Kalahari\u2013Arabia\u2013R\u00edo de la Plata).  Trindade et al. (2006) 211 \nprovided palaeomagnetic support for this for Amazonia and proposed that 212 \namalgamation involved successive suturing along three major orogenic belts, the 213 \n 9\nMozambique, Kuunga and Pampean\u2013Araguaia belts through closure of the 214 \nMozambique, Adamastor and Clymene oceans. However, the associated complex 215 \ncollisional processes produced deformation and magmatism throughout the late 216 \nNeoproterozoic and Early Cambrian in the East African\u2013Antarctic belt and in the 217 \nBrasiliano belt between the Kalahari and Amazonia cratons. Jacobs & Thomas (2004) 218 \nsuggest dispersal of smaller continental fragments by escape tectonics associated with 219 \na Himalayan style and scale mountain range formed in the Mozambique belt. These 220 \nmajor orogenies, and their topographical and erosional consequences, are the most 221 \nprobable explanation for the widespread occurrence of detrital zircons of this age span 222 \nin the subsequent sedimentary record of both East and West Gondwana margins (See 223 \nalso Squire et al., 2006). According to Basei et al. (2005), a narrow band of 224 \nNeoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks on the Atlantic coast of South America is 225 \nequivalent to the southwest African sequences formed by erosion of the Kalahari and 226 \nNamaqua\u2013Natal basement and was left behind on the Cretaceous opening of the South 227 \nAtlantic Ocean, so that the suture zone resulting from closure of the Adamastor ocean 228 \nnow lies within southeastern Brazil and Uruguay. 229 \n 230 \nDuring and subsequent to Late Cambrian times, West Gondwana continued to accrete 231 \nmicrocontinents and terrane fragments (e.g., Cawood, 2005; Vaughan and Livermore, 232 \n2005). The origin of some, such as the Precordillera terrane and its relationship to 233 \nLaurentia and the Pampia Terrane, continues to be extremely controversial (e.g., 234 \nThomas and Astini, 2003; Finney et al., 2005). 235 \n 236 \n4. The oceanic margin of West Gondwana 237 \n 238 \n 10\n4.1 South America 239 \n 240 \nIn the southern South American sector of the margin, the accretionary orogen model 241 \nhas to take into account widely held ideas of collisional accretion of individual 242 \nterranes of pre-existing continental crust (Fig. 4). Many of these terranes were first 243 \nproposed and named by Ramos (1988) and, although many are accepted in general, 244 \nthe essential details of their delineation, composition, and the timing of their accretion 245 \nto Gondwana continue to be controversial.  246 \n 247 \nThe best known of these is the Precordillera terrane (Astini et al., 1995), often equated 248 \nwith and referred to as Cuyania (Ramos, 1988; 2004). This has an outcrop area at least 249 \n300 km from north-to-south and less than 100 km in width where the geology is 250 \ndominated by Cambrian to Middle Ordovician limestones, succeeded unconformably 251 \nby Silurian\u2013Devonian clastic sediments that pass upwards into typical Gondwana 252 \nsequence lacustrine deposits and red beds of Carboniferous to Triassic age. Alonso et 253 \nal. (2008) present structural and sedimentological evidence for the passive margin 254 \nnature of this sequence. The most significant feature of the limestones is a change 255 \nfrom a Cambrian brachiopod and trilobite fauna of Laurentian affinity to a Middle to 256 \nLate Ordovician Gondwana fauna (Benedetto, 1998; Astini et al., 2004).  For many, 257 \nthis supports the idea that the Precordillera terrane was derived from Laurentia, but 258 \napproached Gondwana during the Early Ordovician, followed by accretion during a 259 \nMiddle Ordovician collision. This idea is supported by a wide range of evidence, e.g., 260 \nan Early-to-Middle magmatic arc including both I- and S-type granites developed on 261 \nthe marginal continental crust of Gondwana \u2013 the Famatinian arc (Pankhurst et al., 262 \n1998a; Pankhurst et al., 2000). Other aspects compatible with this scenario are 263 \n 11\ncontemporaneous bentonite ash bands in the Precordillera limestones (Huff et al., 264 \n1998; Fanning et al., 2004), and palaeomagnetic data (Rapalini, 2005).  Middle 265 \nOrdovician metamorphism has been found in rocks east of the Precordillera (Casquet 266 \net al., 2001; Vujovich et al., 2004) and equated with the collision stage, and Castro de 267 \nMachuca et al. (2008) ascribe an Early Silurian age to major post-collisional shear 268 \nzones. This is also the interpretation given in Chernicoff et al. (2007) who have 269 \nstudied detrital zircon in a Late Ordovician\u2013Devonian sedimentary sequence which 270 \nthey regard as deposited in a post-collisional foreland basin. However, others (e.g., 271 \nAce\u00f1olaza et al., 2002) have proposed an alternative origin for the Precordillera 272 \nterrane in another part of West Gondwana, with Ordovician emplacement by massive 273 \nstrike-slip movement along the margin. Attempts to resolve these opposing 274 \nhypotheses for the origin source of the Precordillera terrane continue without final 275 \nagreement, largely based on the patterns of detrital zircon provenance ages 276 \ndetermined by U\u2013Pb geochronology (Thomas and Astini, 2003; Finney et al., 2005).  277 \n 278 \nAnother aspect of the Precordillera terrane hypothesis is the nature and origin of its 279 \nunderlying crustal basement. Unfortunately, this is not unambiguously exposed. There 280 \nis indirect indication for it consisting of a high-grade metamorphic complex of 281 \n\u2018Grenvillian\u2019 age through the occurrence of ~1000 Ma amphibolite xenoliths brought 282 \nup in a Miocene dacite through the easternmost limestone outcrops (Kay et al., 1996). 283 \nHigh-grade rocks of 1200\u20131000 Ma have since been discovered throughout the 284 \nWestern Sierras Pampeanas sequences to the east of the Precordillera (McDonough et 285 \nal., 1993; Varela et al., 1996; Pankhurst and Rapela, 1998; Casquet et al., 2001; 2005; 286 \n2006). Ordovician limestones are associated with high-grade granite gneiss of 287 \n\u2018Grenville\u2019 age as far south as Ponon Trehue (Fig. 4, Heredia, 2002; Cingolani et al., 288 \n 12\n2005) and \u2018Grenville\u2019-age tonalites at Las Matras (Sato et al., 2000).  Initially these 289 \noccurrences were mostly considered to be representative of the middle crustal 290 \nbasement of the Precordillera terrane, consistent with a Laurentian origin, but more 291 \nrecently (e.g., Galindo et al., 2004; Casquet et al., 2006) it has been suggested that the 292 \n\u2018Grenville\u2019-age rocks of the Western Sierras Pampeanas could be regarded as 293 \nautochthonous Gondwana basement during the Ordovician, and Casquet et al. (2006; 294 \n2007) have interpreted some at least as equivalent to the Arequipa-Antofalla block, 295 \nnormally regarded as unambiguously autochthonous. The true nature of the 296 \nPrecordillera basement thus remains questionable.  297 \n 298 \nThe Eastern Sierras Pampeanas constitute another putative continental terrane 299 \naccretion event (the Pampia terrane of Ramos, 1988, see Fig. 4). This is a belt of 300 \nmigmatitic gneisses, low-grade metasediments, granites and metabasites which 301 \nunderwent orogenic deformation, metamorphism and anatexis in Early-to-Middle 302 \nCambrian times (Rapela et al., 1998a; Rapela et al., 1998b; Rapela et al., 2002), 303 \nalthough Guereschi and Martino (2008) suggest that an even older migmatization 304 \nevent may also have occurred. Their Early Palaeozoic history is thus incompatible 305 \nwith the Palaeoproterozoic R\u00edo de la Plata craton to the east and the passive margin 306 \nlimestones of the Precordillera sequence to the west, suggesting an exotic terrane. The 307 \npredominant Nd model age signature of these rocks is a Mesoproterozoic one (as is 308 \nthat of the Famatinian rocks to the west). For this reason, Rapela et al. (1998b) 309 \nfollowed previous authors in thinking that the metasedimentary component must have 310 \nbeen derived from such a source to the east as a foreland sequence above an eastward 311 \ndipping subduction zone; however, no Mesoproterozoic source is exposed. They 312 \nsuggested that the terrane was not allochthonous but had previously been rifted-off 313 \n 13\nfrom a similar position on the Gondwana margin in Neoproterozoic times, and was 314 \nsimilar to the Arequipa\u2013Antofalla blocks of northern Chile and Peru.  Simpson et al. 315 \n(2003) and Schwartz and Gromet (2004) proposed subduction of a spreading ridge in 316 \nMiddle Cambrian times as an alternative to collision of a continental block. As a 317 \nrecent development based on detrital zircon U\u2013Pb and whole-rock Sm\u2013Nd data, 318 \nEscayola et al. (2007) have proposed a radical model in which subduction towards the 319 \nwest occurred in Neoproterozoic times, with sediments being deposited in a back-arc 320 \nbasin from both the Grenville-age Western Sierras Pampeanas and the arc itself rather 321 \nthan from the R\u00edo de la Plata craton to the east. The high-grade metamorphism of the 322 \nPampean belt followed Early Cambrian closure of the back-arc basin. This could 323 \nexplain the metabasites (as basin floor remnants) but there is no evidence for the arc 324 \nitself. The problem of the Pampean orogeny is ripe for new data to resolve these and 325 \npossibly other alternatives, and Rapela et al. (in press) present new evidence on the 326 \nextent of the craton, the origin of the Pampean belt metasedimentary rocks and the 327 \nCambrian tectonic events leading to their juxtaposition. 328 \n 329 \nThe latest collisional event proposed by Ramos (1988) for the central part of this 330 \nsector in that of the hypothetical Chilenia terrane (Fig. 4). This is supposed to have 331 \noccurred in Devonian time, and was principally invoked in order to explain granite 332 \nmagmatism of this age that occurs both within the Pampean belt and to the south. A 333 \nmajor unit in the former category is the Achala batholith in the southern Sierras de 334 \nC\u00f3rdoba. This consists of evolved S-type granites (some with high U contents), of 335 \ngenerally post-orogenic characteristics (Lira and Kirschbaum, 1990). Geuna et al. 336 \n(2007) present palaeomagnetic data that support rapid cooling soon after 337 \ncrystallization.  338 \n 14\n 339 \nFinally, moving south to Patagonia, we arrive at a situation that has been a long-lived 340 \npuzzle. The source of the problem is the ?Cambrian to Permian Gondwanide 341 \nsedimentary sequence that forms a Late Permian fold and thrust belt in the Sierra de la 342 \nVentana (aka Sierras Australes) of southernmost Buenos Aires province, Argentina 343 \n(Fig. 4). As emphasized by du Toit (1937), this has an obvious continuation in the 344 \nCape Fold Belt of South Africa and the Ellsworth Mountains sequence of West 345 \nAntarctica \u2013 all of these must have been joined together as a single stratigraphical and 346 \ntectonic system during the Late Palaeozoic evolution of Gondwana.  347 \n 348 \nRamos (1984; 1986) proposed that an allochthonous (exotic) Patagonian terrane 349 \ncollided with cratonic South America (supercontinental Gondwana) along the R\u00edo 350 \nColorado zone (Fig. 4) in Carboniferous times. This was thought to have resulted 351 \nfrom southwest-dipping subduction beneath the North Patagonian Massif. Devonian\u2013352 \nCarboniferous penetrative deformation, southward-verging folds and southward-353 \ndirected thrusting of supracrustal rocks of the northeastern North Patagonian Massif 354 \nwas described by Chernicoff and Caminos (1996) and elaborated in a detailed 355 \nstructural study by von Gosen (2003), who argued for Permian rather than 356 \nCarboniferous crustal shortening, and possibly a northeastward-directed accretionary 357 \nprocess. 358 \n 359 \nA major revision of the original collision model for Patagonia has been proposed by 360 \nPankhurst et al. (2006). They claim that the majority of rocks in the North Patagonian 361 \nMassif are autochthonous to Gondwana. The basement to the immediate south of the 362 \nSierra de la Ventana itself includes Late Neoproterozoic and Cambrian granites and 363 \n 15\nvolcanic rocks of a similar age to those of the Pampean orogeny, albeit in a different 364 \ntectonic setting, and the northeastern part of the North Patagonian Massif has 365 \nOrdovician granite magmatism and metamorphism equivalent to the Famatinian 366 \norogeny. There is no evidence of a Grenville-age belt similar to the Western Sierras 367 \nPampeanas, but this could possibly be hidden beneath the deep Mesozoic and younger 368 \nsediments of the R\u00edo Colorado basin. Thus any collision must have occurred to the 369 \nsouth of this massif with its deformed Cambro-Ordovician cover. The discovery of 370 \nEarly Carboniferous subduction-related magmatism followed by mid-Carboniferous 371 \nS-type granites in a belt that runs southeastwards from the western margin of the 372 \nNorth Patagonian Massif led to the proposal that this was essentially the zone of 373 \ncollision, and that the distinctive crustal complexes of the Deseado Massif to the south 374 \nrepresents part of the colliding terrane (Pankhurst et al., 2006). The pre-Jurassic 375 \ngeology of the Deseado Massif is very poorly exposed, but it includes Late 376 \nNeoproterozoic sedimentation, Cambrian plutonism, and both Silurian and Devonian 377 \ngranite magmatism (Pankhurst et al., 2003).  378 \n 379 \nAnother prominent feature of the Palaeozoic geology of southern South America is 380 \nthe enormously voluminous and extensive eruption of Permian and Triassic rhyolitic 381 \nrocks and the emplacement of associated granites (ca 290\u2013220 Ma) \u2013 the Choiyoi 382 \ncomplex (Kay et al., 1989; Mpodozis and Kay, 1990). These are so far most closely 383 \ncontrolled in terms of their chronology in Patagonia, where they have a wide range 384 \nages and isotopic characteristics. Initiation in Early Permian times was ascribed by 385 \nPankhurst et al. (2006) to post-collisional break-off of the down-going slab, perhaps 386 \nwith delamination of the crust beneath the North Patagonian Massif, leading to large-387 \nscale access of heat to the middle crust. It was suggested that this could have lead to 388 \n 16\npromulgation of the slab break-off towards the north along the Gondwana margin, 389 \nwhere the magmatism of the Permo-Triassic Choiyoi Group may be more closely 390 \nrelated to east-directed subduction than to collision.  391 \n 392 \nSome of the youngest rocks in this sector of West Gondwana are the accretionary 393 \ncomplexes forming the farthest outboard part of the margin (e.g., Vaughan and 394 \nStorey, 2000; Herv\u00e9 and Fanning, 2003; Mortimer, 2004; Glen, 2005).  These largely 395 \nformed after Gondwana was assembled and are semi-continuous from southern South 396 \nAmerica to eastern Australia, ranging in age from Carboniferous to Cretaceous. 397 \nDetrital zircon studies show that he material within these complexes are of 398 \nGondwanan origin (Herv\u00e9 et al., 2003; Augustsson et al., 2006). Sep\u00falveda et al. 399 \n(2008) show that a relatively recent example, the Madre de Dios terrane (Fig. 4), 400 \ncontains evidence of a Late Carboniferous\u2013Early Permian mid-ocean ridge origin. The 401 \nterrane was accreted to the Gondwana margin during deformation in Late Triassic-402 \nEarly Jurassic times, called the Chonide orogeny (Herv\u00e9 et al., 2003; Sep\u00falveda et al., 403 \n2008) in Patagonia, but which was part of a global event (Vaughan and Livermore, 404 \n2005). 405 \n 406 \n4.2 South Africa 407 \n 408 \nThe Cape Fold Belt of South Africa (e.g., Johnston, 2000) (including the Falkland 409 \nIslands block (Mitchell et al., 1986; Storey et al., 1999)), together with the Sierra de la 410 \nVentana of eastern Argentina (e.g., Rapela et al., 2003) and the Ellsworth Mountains 411 \nof West Antarctica (e.g., Curtis, 2001), forms the central part of the margin of West 412 \nGondwana.  The basement consists of the 2000-1000 Ma metamorphic volcano-413 \n 17\nsedimentary rocks of the Namaqua-Natal belt (e.g., Dewey et al., 2006; Eglington, 414 \n2006; McCourt et al., 2006), which was deformed during late Neoproterozoic to early 415 \nPalaeozoic Gondwana amalgamation (e.g., Jacobs et al., 2003).  The Phanerozoic 416 \ncontinental margin sedimentary succession is represented by the 6\u201310 km thick, 417 \nsiliciclastic Cape Supergroup (Broquet, 1992; Barnett et al., 1997) and subsequent 418 \nglacial, marine and terrestrial-fluvial successions of the Karoo Supergroup, which 419 \nincludes the Dwyka, Ecca, Beaufort and Stormberg lithostratigraphic units 420 \n(Catuneanu et al., 2005).  The sedimentary succession ranges in age from 421 \nNeoproterozoic to mid-Jurassic, terminated by basin-wide basaltic volcanism of the 422 \nKaroo Igneous Province (e.g., Duncan et al., 1997).  This sector of the margin appears 423 \nto represent a passive margin during the Early Palaeozoic (Shone and Booth, 2005), 424 \nwith the accumulation of predominantly reworked continental sedimentary deposits 425 \n(the \u2018Samfrau Geosyncline\u2019 (Du Toit, 1937)).  It was deformed by the Gondwanide 426 \nOrogeny in the Late Permian-Early Triassic (e.g., Johnston, 2000).  This major fold 427 \nbelt is often modelled as an intraplate orogen representing far-field-deformation 428 \nrelated to distant subduction (e.g., Johnston, 2000), although  Dalziel et al. (2000) 429 \nsuggested that flattening of the subduction zone could have been driven by interaction 430 \nwith mantle plume that was subsequently responsible for continental break-up. 431 \nHowever, a recent re-evaluation by Pankhurst et al. (2006), using data from the South 432 \nAmerican, Sierra de la Ventana section of the fold belt, supports a possible collisional 433 \norigin. 434 \n 435 \n4.3 West Antarctica 436 \n 437 \n 18\nWest Antarctica was originally split into four (Dalziel and Elliot, 1982), or five 438 \n(Storey et al., 1988), tectonic blocks.  The innermost of these is the Ellsworth-439 \nWhitmore mountains block, which has sedimentological affinities to the Cape Fold 440 \nBelt of South Africa (Curtis et al., 1999; Curtis, 2001). It preserves a passive margin 441 \nvolcano-sedimentary succession that ranges from the Cambrian to the Permo-Triassic 442 \nand may have been derived from the Natal embayment (Randall and Mac Niocaill, 443 \n2004).  444 \n 445 \nRecent reassessments of the large-scale structure of West Antarctica suggests that the 446 \nremaining blocks of West Antarctica can be subdivided into at least three main terrane 447 \nbelts that appear to be continuous from the New Zealand sector of East Gondwana to 448 \nthe Antarctic Peninsula (Pankhurst et al., 1998b; Vaughan and Storey, 2000). The 449 \ninnermost and oldest of these is termed the Ross province in West Antarctica and 450 \ncalled the Eastern Domain in the Antarctic Peninsula (Vaughan and Storey, 2000). 451 \nThe Hf-isotope composition of inherited zircons in Late Palaeozoic\u2013Mesozoic 452 \ngranites, migmatites and paragneisses from the Antarctic Peninsula show that they are 453 \nderived from Mesoproterozoic sources and have been taken to suggest that this 454 \ndomain is underlain by crust of that age (e.g., Flowerdew et al., 2006). The oldest 455 \nrocks of this Palaeozoic ocean-marginal domain are the Ordovician turbidite 456 \nsequences of the Swanson Formation of Marie Byrd Land (Pankhurst et al., 1998b). 457 \nThese have no equivalents elsewhere in West Antarctica although turbidites of similar 458 \nage are seen in the Robertson Bay terrane of Victoria Land in East Gondwana (Stump, 459 \n1995). These are intruded by the Ford Granodiorite in Marie Byrd Land, which are 460 \nequivalent in age to the older granitoids from Target Hill in the northern Antarctic 461 \nPeninsula (Millar et al., 2002). A suite of granitoids emplaced between 340 and 320 462 \n 19\nmillion years ago (Pankhurst et al., 1998b) are widely developed in Marie Byrd Land 463 \nand are also seen at Target Hill in the northern Antarctic Peninsula (Millar et al., 464 \n2002). Although not developed in Marie Byrd Land, the Eastern Domain in the 465 \nAntarctic Peninsula contains a sequence of Middle Jurassic Gondwana break-up 466 \nrhyolite volcanic rocks, the Ellsworth Land Volcanic Group (Hunter et al., 2006b), 467 \nand an Early Jurassic to Cretaceous (Willan and Hunter, 2005; Hunter et al., 2006a) 468 \nsequence of deep and shallow marine clastic sedimentary rocks called the Latady 469 \nGroup (Laudon et al., 1983; Hunter and Cantrill, 2006). The latest event seen in this 470 \ndomain is the mid-Cretaceous emplacement of arc plutons of the voluminous Lassiter 471 \nCoast Intrusive Suite (e.g., Flowerdew et al., 2005). 472 \n 473 \nOutboard of the Ross Province\/Eastern Domain is a series of magmatic arc terranes 474 \ntermed the Amundsen Province in Marie Byrd Land (Pankhurst et al., 1998b) and the 475 \nCentral Domain in the Antarctic Peninsula (Vaughan and Storey, 2000). The 476 \nAmundsen Province and Central Domain are largely magmatic and show many 477 \nsimilarities in compositional types and in timing of magmatic emplacement (Vaughan 478 \nand Storey, 2000). Plutonism appears to have peaked in three discrete episodes in the 479 \nLate Triassic, mid-Jurassic, and Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (Leat et al., 1995; 480 \nVaughan and Storey, 2000). Recent geophysical data from the Antarctic Peninsula 481 \nsuggest that the Central Domain is composite and made up of smaller terranes 482 \n(Ferraccioli et al., 2006). So far, a mafic eastern Central Domain and a granitic 483 \nwestern Central Domain have been identified (Ferraccioli et al., 2006). Major 484 \ndeformational episodes affected the Central Domain in Late Triassic-early Jurassic 485 \nand mid-Cretaceous times (Vaughan et al., 2002a; Vaughan et al., 2002b; Vaughan 486 \nand Livermore, 2005).  487 \n 20\n 488 \nThe outermost of the West Antarctic terrane belts is termed the Western Domain in 489 \nthe Antarctic Peninsula (Vaughan and Storey, 2000). It has no equivalent in Marie 490 \nByrd Land although similar accretionary complex terranes are developed in New 491 \nZealand and in southern South America (Vaughan and Storey, 2000). Accretionary 492 \ncomplex rocks range in age from Late Carboniferous (Kelly et al., 2001) to Late 493 \nCretaceous (Vaughan and Storey, 2000). The Western Domain in the Antarctic 494 \nPeninsula was affected by deformation in the Late Triassic-early Jurassic and in the 495 \nmid-Cretaceous (Vaughan and Livermore, 2005). 496 \n 497 \n5. Adjacent parts of the oceanic margin of East Gondwana 498 \n 499 \n5.1 New Zealand 500 \n 501 \nThe New Zealand sector of the eastern Gondwana margin (e.g. Mortimer, 2004; 502 \nWandres and Bradshaw, 2005) is made up of a collage of terranes, composed of 503 \nbasement rocks ranging in age from early Cambrian to late Early Cretaceous. These 504 \ncan be grouped into three provinces, the Western Province, the Median Province, and 505 \nthe Eastern Province (Coombs et al., 1976; Bishop et al., 1985; Bradshaw, 1989). The 506 \nWestern Province is made up of two terranes that formed the Palaeozoic margin of 507 \nEast Gondwana and largely consist of lower Palaeozoic metasedimentary rocks cut by 508 \nseries of Devonian, Carboniferous and Early Cretaceous granite plutons (e.g., Cooper, 509 \n1989; Muir et al., 1996; Waight et al., 1998). In addition there are some minor 510 \nvolcanic and metamorphic rocks of Cambrian age (e.g., M\u00fcnker and Crawford, 2000). 511 \nThe Median Province is largely magmatic and consists of suites of Carboniferous to 512 \n 21\nEarly Cretaceous subduction-related arc plutons with subordinate volcanic and 513 \nsedimentary rocks (e.g., Muir et al., 1998; Mortimer et al., 1999). The Eastern 514 \nProvince (e.g., Mortimer, 2004; Wandres and Bradshaw, 2005) consists of arc, fore-515 \narc and accretionary complex rocks that formed and accumulated during Permian to 516 \nCretaceous plate convergence and subduction.  These have been subdivided into up to 517 \n13 terranes, several of which are grouped into a Torlesse Superterrane (Campbell, 518 \n2000).  As pointed out by Wandres and Bradshaw (2005) the bulk of New Zealand 519 \ncontinental crust is submerged by the sea.  Adams (2008) examines the terrane 520 \nevidence from this hidden area by studying Rb-Sr metamorphic and U-Pb detrital 521 \nzircon ages from the emergent island parts of the submerged continental crust, called 522 \n\"Zealandia\".  The data show that the Campbell Plateau segment of Zealandia has clear 523 \naffinities with the Western Province\/Ross Province and the Median 524 \nProvince\/Amundsen Province, with little evidence for extension of the Eastern 525 \nProvince. 526 \n 527 \n5.2 Victoria Land and the Transantarctic Mountains 528 \n 529 \nAlthough strictly part of East Gondwana, the Transantarctic Mountains are important 530 \nbecause they both acted as a source for sediments deposited in West Gondwana, 531 \nparticularly in West Antarctica (e.g., Flowerdew et al., 2006), and were themselves a 532 \nsedimentary sink for sediments derived from West Gondwana in Late Palaeozoic and 533 \nEarly Mesozoic times (e.g., Elliot and Fanning, 2007).  At their most northerly extent, 534 \nin Northern Victoria Land, the Transantarctic Mountains are composed of Cambrian 535 \nand Ordovician terranes amalgamated during the Ross Orogeny (recently reviewed by 536 \nTessensohn and Henjes-Kunst, 2005).  The main part of the Transantarctic Mountains 537 \n 22\nis underlain by Neoproterozoic, and possibly older (e.g., Fanning et al., 1996; 538 \nFitzsimons, 2003), basement, intruded by granitoid plutons of the Ross Orogeny 539 \n(Stump, 1995).  This is unconformably overlain by the quartzose sandstones of the 540 \nDevonian Taylor Group (Isbell, 1999).  The Taylor Group was deformed by the end-541 \nPalaeozoic Gondwanan orogeny (Cawood, 2005) and is in turn unconformably 542 \noverlain by the Permo-Triassic glacial, marine, terrestrial and fluvial sedimentary 543 \nrocks of the Victoria Group (Collinson et al., 1994).  This upper sedimentary 544 \nsequence was intruded in the Lower Jurassic by sills and dikes of Ferrar Dolerite (e.g., 545 \nHergt et al., 1991) with co-magmatic overlying basaltic pyroclastic rocks (e.g., Elliot 546 \nand Hanson, 2001) and Kirkpatrick Basalt flood lavas (e.g., Elliot et al., 1999). 547 \n 548 \n6. Concluding remarks 549 \n 550 \nThe longevity and extent of the Gondwana margin has ensured that it has remained 551 \nthe subject of intense study for over seventy years.  It was one of the birthplaces of 552 \nterrane theory (e.g., Vaughan et al., 2005b) and it continues to be a proving ground for 553 \ntheories of supercontinental amalgamation (e.g., Cawood, 2005) and break-up (e.g., 554 \nRapela et al., 2005; Veevers, 2005; Willan and Hunter, 2005).   555 \n 556 \nAn interesting question is the one of translation of terranes along the Gondwana 557 \nmargin. Cawood et al.(2002) have shown evidence for translations of thousands of 558 \nkilometres along the Gondwana margin from the Permian to the Cretaceous, and this 559 \nidea has been inherent in some treatments of the older Palaeozoic tectonics. Structural 560 \nevidence suggests that large scale strike-slip faults exist (e.g. Vaughan and Storey, 561 \n2000). Some support for large-scale translation can be derived from zircon data 562 \n 23\nalthough the only way that these movements can be confirmed or quantified is by 563 \nmultidisciplinary studies that include palaeomagnetic analysis and interpretation. 564 \n 565 \nAcknowledgements 566 \nThe authors would like to thank Brendan Murphy and Carlos Rapela for thoughtful 567 \nand constructive reviews, and M.

(2006) and personal 1083 \ncommunications from C.W. Rapela and C. Casquet. Amazonia, R\u00edo Apa, R\u00edo 1084 \nde la Plata (and in some schemes, Arequipa and Antofalla) are the cratonic 1085 \nblocks of Palaeoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic age. The Pampean belt (which 1086 \nencompasses the Eastern Sierras Pampeanas Pampia terrane of Ramos (1988), 1087 \nis shown as continuous with the Araguaia belt of Brazil, following Trindade et 1088 \nal. (2006), and the approximate form of the Patagonian plate is from Pankhurst 1089 \net al. (2006). The known extent of Grenville-age belts of Sunsas (S) and the 1090 \nWestern Sierras Pampeanas (W) is indicated, although the latter also occurs 1091 \nbeneath the Argentine Precordillera (Cy), as either stratigraphical or tectonic 1092 \nbasement. The Ordovician Famatinian orogenic belt (F) overprints the earlier 1093 \ncomplexes, including those of the Antofalla block, where Lucassen et al. 1094 \n 34\n(2000) recognise Pampean metamorphism and magmatism as reflecting an 1095 \naccretionary orogeny. 1096 \n 1097 \nAlan P.M. Vaughan is a Principal Investigator and head of the Palaeoenvironments 1098 \nGroup at the British Antarctic survey, where he has worked for the past 16 1099 \nyears.  His work has taken to him to Antarctica six times.  He is Earth sciences 1100 \neditor of Antarctic science and UK representative on the Gondwana 1101 \nCommittee.  He graduated from Trinity College Dublin in 1985 with a gold 1102 \nmedal in natural sciences and he 1103 \nreceived his PhD from that institution 1104 \nin 1991.  His main interests are on the 1105 \nlong-term evolution of the Earth both 1106 \ntectonically and 1107 \npalaeoenvironmentally, with a 1108 \nparticular focus on the influence of 1109 \nlarge scale tectonic and magmatic 1110 \nprocesses on global 1111 \npalaeoenvironments.  He has also 1112 \nworked extensively on the tectonic 1113 \nevolution of the Antarctic sector of 1114 \nWest Gondwana.  He has collaborated 1115 \nwith geoscientists in New Zealand, 1116 \nBrazil, Spain, Chile and the USA, and 1117 \nhas been involved in several published 1118 \npapers and books. 1119 \n 1120 \nRobert (Bob) Pankhurst is Visiting Research Associate at the British Geological 1121 \nSurvey, where he worked for 26 years in the NERC Isotope Geosciences 1122 \nLaboratory carrying out geochronological and isotope research on behalf of 1123 \nthe British Antarctic Survey (BAS), during which he undertook fieldwork 1124 \nextensively in Antarctica (nine summer field seasons) and southern South 1125 \nAmerica, concentrating on the latter since official retirement in 2002. He was 1126 \nawarded the Polar Medal in 1987 and has been elected corresponding member 1127 \nof both the Chilean and 1128 \nArgentine Academies of 1129 \nScience, as well as of the 1130 \nArgentine Geological 1131 \nAssociation. He is Chief 1132 \nBooks Editor for the 1133 \nGeological Society, London, 1134 \nand Associate Editor for the 1135 \nJournal of South American 1136 \nEarth Sciences. He graduated 1137 \nfrom the University of 1138 \nCambridge (B.A. 1964, M.A. 1139 \n1967) where he also holds the 1140 \ntitle of Doctor of Science 1141 \n(Sc.D. 1998). He received a 1142 \nDiploma in Geochemistry 1143 \n(1965) and then a D.Phil. 1144 \n 35\n(1968) from the University of Oxford, where he stayed as Research Fellow 1145 \nworking on projects in Scotland, West Greenland and Iceland before joining 1146 \nBAS in 1976. His main interests are in isotope dating and geochemistry 1147 \napplied to igneous petrogenesis, metamorphism and sediment provenance in 1148 \nrelation to the evolution of the continental crust of West Gondwana, and hence 1149 \nthe tectonic processes involved. He has actively collaborated with 1150 \ngeoscientists in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, New Zealand, Spain, and 1151 \nthe USA, and has been involved in numerous published papers and several 1152 \nbooks. 1153 \n\n\n\n\n"}
