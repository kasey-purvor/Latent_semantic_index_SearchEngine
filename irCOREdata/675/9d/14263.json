Morris and Eileen Scanlon\nInstitute of Educational Technology, Open University\nemail: e.j.morris@ope.ac.uk\nResearch at the Open University has investigated students' learning of statistical con-\ncepts and how information technology can be effectively used to support this process.\nPrevious empirical work has looked at psychology students' misconceptions relating to\ncorrelation and how computer-based learning environments can be used to address these.\nThis paper reports on the findings from a qualitative study that investigated students'\nlearning collaboratively from a multimedia application called ActivStats.\nIntroduction\nStudents studying psychology or a social science have to take courses in statistics, but\nstudents often experience difficulties in learning statistical concepts and techniques.\nIndeed, there is a body of interdisciplinary research that indicates that students tend to\nhave confusions and difficulties with a variety of topics in statistics (Garfield and Ahlgren,\n1988; Shaughnessy, 1992). It has been found that students hold misconceptions relating to\nfundamental statistical concepts, such as the mean and correlation (Mevarech, 1983;\nMorris, 1997). Research in computer-based learning has looked at how the computer can\nbe used effectively to address students' statistical misconceptions and help students come\nto understand key statistical ideas (Cumming and Thomason, 1995; Morris, 1998).\nIt has been argued that the design of computer-based learning materials should exploit the\ncapabilities of computer technology (Shuell, 1992; Milheim, 1996). For example, in\ncontrast to traditional forms of instruction, such as text, the computer can provide the\nlearner with multiple representations that are dynamically linked and offer immediate\nfeedback to their actions at the human-computer interface. In the case of statistics,\ncomputer technology can be used to offer multiple representations of statistical concepts\nthat are computationally linked so that changes in one representation respond to changes\nin another. For example, computer-based learning materials can be designed so that when\na learner changes the available data set, or the value of a statistic, such as a correlation\ncoefficient, they will see the corresponding change in the data displayed on a scatter plot.\n80\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nResearch at the Open University has been looking at how computer-based learning can be\nused effectively to support students' learning of statistics. Previous work in this area\nconcerned the development and evaluation of a computer-based learning system called\nLink (Morris, 1998).\nLink\nLink is a computer-based learning system that was implemented at the Open University\nand was designed to be used by psychology students to review their understanding of\ncorrelation (Morris, 1998). The design of this system was informed by research-based\nprinciples of learning, a review of computer-assisted learning programs covering correla-\ntion, and formative and expert evaluation studies. Unlike the systems that were reviewed,\nLink makes use of data from authentic studies in psychology and provides learner activities\nthat were specifically designed to address students' misconceptions about correlation. For\nexample, empirical work has shown that students can hold misconceptions concerning\nnegative correlations and the strength of correlations: students think that a negative\ncorrelation indicates no relationship between variables and\/or that a positive correlation is\nstronger than a negative correlation when this is not the case. Learner activities in the\nsystem were therefore designed to address these confusions. For example, activity 2 was\ndesigned to remedy a student's unidirectional conception of correlation where they\ninappropriately think that a negative correlation indicates no relationship (Figure 1). In\nthis activity a student must decide from a set of correlations the coefficient that represents\nthe scatter plot that is displayed. Each of the correlations in the data table are linked to a\ngraph so that when a user selects a correlation a scatter plot that represents the relationship\nis presented. A user is therefore provided with graphical feedback and text-based feedback\nthat describes the relationship represented by the correlation that was selected.\nFigure I: A\nlearner activity in\nLink\n* \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 A t e a a d\nCejtcssioa\n* ' Cooe&laas* \u20220.K-\n; Cosselatiorg\nj - - d ^ |\nR\u00ab\u00bb2t4 evta\u00ab J\n\u00aba<!jtaWi\u00abvta3 i\n| \u00a32S {\nOK) k.\nted\n3\npression s\ni S i '00^ indicate th*t ina\u00abu\u00abf in\nabated to d\u00aba\u00abau\u00abs m th\u00ab\n81\nErica J. Morris and Ei\/een Scanbn Active learning of statistics: a case study\nA summative evaluation study of Link was undertaken involving fifty psychology students to\nassess the effect on students' understanding of correlation. It was found that the use of Link\nsignificantly contributed to students' general understanding of correlation (Morris,\nforthcoming). Although this empirical work indicated that the use of Link contributed to\nstudents' understanding of correlation, one of the limitations of the system relates to the\ndesign of the learner activity described above. Due to the constraints of using genuine data\nsets, the learner is not able directly to modify the data or the data points on the scatter plot and\nsee the corresponding changes in a linked representation. This suggested that further work was\nrequired to look carefully at whether students' understanding of correlation is affected by the\nuse of learner activities that provide multiple representations that are computationally linked.\nThe study described in this paper was conducted to investigate students using a multimedia\nlearning resource called ActivStats (ActivStats, 1997) and whether particular kinds of\nlearner activities affected the learning process.\nActivStats\nActivStats is a multimedia learning resource that also provides learner activities for\ncorrelation. The study described in this paper was designed to investigate whether these\nactivities might affect students' understanding of correlation and to identify aspects of\nActivStats that students find valuable in terms of the learning process.\nThe study involved pairs of students who were asked to work together on a series of\nactivities in ActivStats. The students were asked to talk between themselves about what\nthey were thinking and doing while they used the resource, which meant that qualitative\ndata concerning the process of learning could be gathered. Issroff (1993) has described a\nmethodology for research in computer-supported cooperative learning which has provided\npractical guidelines to help researchers to design and study effective computer-supported\nco-operative learning situations. Accordingly, these guidelines were followed as\nappropriate. For example, Issroff (1993) has recommended that students should be told\nthat they are expected to work together on the computer task and that studies should\ninvolve friendship groupings because these might be contributing factors to the success of\nthe learning process.\nMethod\nParticipants\nSix students who were taking psychology at a university took part in the study. The mean\nage for this group of students was 32 years, with the youngest being 20 and the eldest being\n52. One of the students was studying for a single honours degree in psychology and five of\nthe students were taking a joint degree that included psychology. Although four of the\nstudents were in the first year of their degree and two of the students were in their final\nyear, all of the students had taken a course called 'Quantitative Methods for Psychologists'\nthat covered correlation.\nWhen students were asked to participate in the study they were asked to work with a friend\nor someone they felt happy to work with. Three pairs of students used ActivStats and the\nnames of these students have been changed to assure anonymity: first pair (Mark and\nTrudy), second pair (Daniel and Alan), and third pair (Anna and Mary).\n82\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nSoftware\nActivStats is a multimedia resource for learning statistics which uses the metaphor of a\n'Lesson Book' to provide video, text, graphics and learner activities. In using ActivStats,\nstudents were asked to complete activities that included:\nObserve how the magnitude of the Correlation Coefficient reflects the strength of the\nLinear Association. Answer the questions that are presented with this activity (Figure 2).\nConstruct scatter plots with a given correlation. Answer the study questions that are\npresented with this activity (Figure 3 and Figure 4).\nfigure 2: Observe\nhow the magnitude\nof the correlation\nreflects the strength\nof the association\nCorrelation\n0.31 57^\n:-:.:..v\n:\nv.>.,;: v. .';'\n;\u2022\u2022:-.\u2022'\u00bb' .'<-'i:.':'v.'v:\n' .

They were asked to\nwork together by completing specified sections of this application. Students were asked to\ntalk between themselves about what they were thinking and doing while they worked\nthrough the program. Each pair of students was observed while they worked with\nActivStats and by using a recording schedule a written and audio record of the session was\nmade. Here, student-computer interactions and students' comments were noted.\nWhen students had completed the specified tasks, they were interviewed and questions\nabout the application were asked. For example, students were asked what they did and did\nnot like about using ActivStats and what they thought about particular learner activities.\nBased on previous research (Morris, 1997), questions were also employed to look at the\nstudents' understanding of correlation:\n(i) Which correlation is stronger 0.70 or -0.80?\n(ii) Please arrange the set of correlations from the strongest to weakest relationship. (For\nthis question, students were given five correlation coefficients on five small pieces of\npaper. So that the students could arrange the correlations in an order they were also\ngiven a piece of paper that provided a scale with 'Strongest' at one end and 'Weakest' at\nthe other. The students could then place the correlations along this scale.)\n84\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nFindings\nThe learner activities in ActivStats\nObserve how the magnitude of the Correlation Coefficient reflects the strength of the\nLinear Association.\nIn this activity learners are provided with a scatter plot that is linked to a scale. This scale is\ndesigned to represent the correlation coefficient, r, and although it runs from -2.0 to 1.5, the\nslider is bounded at -1.0 and 1.0. Students can adjust the correlation coefficient by moving\nthe slider to the left or right and can therefore observe the effect that this has on the scatter\nplot. This activity also presents two questions that the students were asked to answer: 'What\ndoes a correlation of 0 look like?' and 'How about a correlation of 0.5?' (Figure 2).\nThe first pair of students who worked together on this activity (Mark and Trudy) moved\nthe slider right and left and observed the changes in the scatter plot. They talked while they\ndid this:\nMark: 'Oh that's clever... I like that . . . You're doing a negative correlation now, aren't\nyou?... So if you go the other way.. . should go to positive shouldn't it?'\nTrudy: \"This is no correlation, right? Zero. . . Okay.. . This is positive.'\nMark: 'So we'll start going towards the positive correlation. So if you go right to 1 that\nshould be nearly a straight line, shouldn't it? Forty five degrees (45\u00b0)... Yeah.'\nThis pair of students then went on to talk about the activity: Mark commented 'That is\nvery good' and Trudy remarked, 'It's very visual.' Mark went on to comment:\n'That's excellent... because... it's a hands on thing isn't it. You're actually doing it.'\nThe second pair of students who completed this activity also talked while they moved the\nslider and viewed the corresponding changes in the scatter plot (Daniel and Alan). While\nthese students worked with this activity, they adjusted the slider and Daniel commented\n'no relationship at a l l . . . negative correlation.' As they carried on with the activity, they\nread and answered the questions that are presented with the activity:\nDaniel: 'What does a correlation of zero look like?'\nAlan: 'A mess.'\nDaniel: 'Yeap.'\nAlan: 'How about a correlation of 0.5?'\nDaniel: 'Sort of half way there.'\nWhen the third pair of students (Mary and Anna) tried to answer the questions that are\npresented, Mary commented:\n'Zero scattered everywhere but 0.5 scattered closer (to) each other. Like linear. [She\nlaughs]. Sorry, I don't know.'\nConstruct scatter plots with a given correlation\nThis activity which involved students constructing a series of scatter plots, resulted in a\nnumber of interesting student-computer interactions. In addition, while completing this\nactivity the students tended to take turns at constructing the scatter plots and worked\ntogether by commenting on their actions and the subsequent outcomes (Figure 3 and\nFigure 4).\n85\nErica J. Morris and Eileen Scanlon Active learning of statistics: a case study\nOn this activity students are given the opportunity to construct scatter plots with different\ncorrelations. To do this, students can create a scatter plot by clicking with the mouse to\nplace data points on the graph and they are then able to drag the points to obtain a\nparticular value of a correlation. Firstly, students are asked to construct scatter plots when\nthey can simultaneously view the value of the correlation (Figure 3). Specifically, students\nare asked to build a scatter plot with a correlation of 0.5 and then one of -0.8. Secondly,\nstudents are shown a scatter plot of the age adjusted mortality and median education for\n60 US cities and they are asked to move the points on this scatter plot to observe the\nchanges in the correlation. For this part of the activity, students are asked specific\nquestions including 'What is the effect of omitting the 2 unusual cities?' (Figure 4). Thirdly,\nstudents are asked to construct scatter plots of 0.5 and -0.8 in turn without seeing the value\nof the correlation. When they have constructed the scatter plot in both cases, they can then\nselect the button 'Continue' to obtain the value of the correlation.\nWhen Mark and Trudy attempted to construct a scatter plot of 0.5, Mark initially advised,\n'So, forty five (45\u00b0) is a . . . 1' and they plotted five data points on the scatter plot to obtain\nas Trudy observed, '0.505 . . . Pretty close.' They then dragged the points to obtain an exact\ncorrelation of 0.5, and with reference to the constructed scatter plot, Mark then observed:\n'A correlation of 1 is [a] forty five degree (45\u00b0) line . . . You can see a general pattern and\nalso that's positive.'\nInterestingly, Mark suggested that they try and obtain a correlation of -0.5. Mark did\nobtain a correlation of -0.5 and Trudy responded to this success by clapping. Mark then\nbegan to manipulate a data point on the scatter plot and the pair went on to comment:\nMark 'Only moving one point that's interesting . . . moving that one digit and it altered\nthe whole process that's interesting.'\nTrudy: 'Maybe it really depends on size of the sample.'\nMark: 'Yeah . . . But the general trend is there isn't it? . . . you've got the negative line\nrunning through there if you cast your imaginary line through it.'\nTrudy:'... That means correlation is really sensitive.'\nMark: '. . . Yeah, so if you've got one of these silly outliers . . . it throws the stats\ncompletely out the window... stats, stats and damn lies.'\nTrudy: 'Okay, let's continue.'\nWhile completing the activity, Mark attempted to construct a scatter plot with a\ncorrelation of 0.5 without seeing the value of the correlation. In such a case, when a scatter\nplot has been constructed by the student, they can select the button 'Continue' and the\nprogram provides the actual correlation. Having selected 'Continue', Mark found that he\nhad, however, constructed a scatter plot with a correlation of 0.9 and he commented, 'That\nwas actually close to 1. You really want a lower, flatter curve.' Mark and Trudy then went\non to try and construct a scatter plot with a correlation of -0.8 without seeing the value of\nthe correlation. At first, Mark obtained a correlation of -0.1, the pair laughed and he\ncommented, 'that was just a random guess that was'. Trudy then tried to obtain a\ncorrelation of -0.8 and found that she had constructed a scatter plot with a correlation of\n-0.7. In response to this, Mark observed, 'that's pretty good'. He then went on to comment:\n86\nALT-] Volume 8 Number I\n'I'll give one more go just for a laugh . . . I'll try and see if I can do a linear one.' Mark then\nhad a second attempt at a correlation of -0.8 and subsequently found that he had\nconstructed a scatter plot with a correlation of -0.9. In the later stages of completing the\nactivity, Mark remarked: 'It's a good learning tool to be able to play around with it.'\nOut of the second pair of students, Daniel had a first go at constructing a scatter plot with\na correlation of 0.5. Although Daniel only used four data points for this, he obtained the\nexact correlation of 0.5. To this, the pair of students laughed and Alan responded 'Perfect\nleave it there . . . got to do some more now.'\nAs described above, this activity provides an example relationship between education and\nmortality for 60 US cities. For this part of the activity, Alan moved various data points on\nthe scatter plot and the value of the correlation changed accordingly. This part of the\nactivity presents the question, 'How much can you change the correlation by moving just\none point?' In response to this question, the pair of students moved data points on the\nscatter plot and Daniel decided that 'an outlier will change the value more.' The following\nquestion is also presented with this part of the activity: 'Is the correlation coefficient\nchanged as rapidly whether you move a point near the centre of the plot or a point near the\nsides of the plot?' Daniel and Alan therefore moved a number of data points and Alan\nconcluded, 'So moving one from the centre has more of an effect'.\nThe third pair of students, Anna and Mary, also took turns to try and construct scatter\nplots with different correlations. However, this pair did not try to drag the data points that\nthey placed on the scatter plot. For example, before these students attempted to construct a\nscatter plot with a correlation of 0.5 for the second time, Mary asked Anna 'Can we use the\npoints after we've placed?' and Anna went on to say, 'No, we have to answer the question'.\nIt is clear from the above findings that while students completed the activity they readily\ntook turns in constructing scatter plots to obtain specified values of correlation. In\naddition, the recorded interactions between students and the comments that they made\nindicate that students helped each other by suggesting possible strategies to obtain a\nparticular correlation. For example, when Daniel attempted to construct a scatter plot with\na correlation of 0.5, Alan commented, '[Be] careful not to do too straight [a] line.'\nThe findings suggest that the above activity was valuable to students because it showed\nhow the correlation coefficient represents data displayed on a scatter plot. The learner\nactivity also enabled the first and second pair of students to see the effect that outliers have\non the value of a correlation: the students dragged particular data points on a scatter plot\nand watched how the correlation changed.\nStudents' opinions of the software\nAll of the students were interviewed as a pair after they had used ActivStats. They were\nasked 'What did you like about using ActivStatsT In response to this question, Mark\ncommented as follows:\nI would say that the hands on experience of being able to manipulate the data on the\nscreen . . . you could alter it by playing around with it. It gave you probably a little bit\nbetter understanding of what was . . . meant by the figures 'cos so many people look at\nfigures and it doesn't really mean anything whereas I think when we were taught in our\nstats course . . . to always look at graphs... you know as well as the figures. Then you\n87\nErica}. Morris and Eileen Scanlon Active learning of statistics: a case study\ncan see . . . the relationship . . . the interesting point about. . . statistics to me that they\ndon't always tell the truth . . . and especially when you get things like outliers... you get\nthat one little figure there and if you push him right on the outside it really can muck the\nsort of correlation up . . . You can visually do i t . . . so that's the positive [aspect of the\nprogram].\nDaniel also thought that the use of scatter plots in the program was helpful: 'I thought...\nthe actual visual side of plotting your own scatter plot was very useful... Far better than\nwading through a textbook.' Indeed, Alan commented: 'Anything that isn't a text book is\nalways going to be more interesting.'\nStudents were asked what they thought about the activity that provided a scale of a\ncorrelation that was linked to a scatter plot. To this Alan remarked, 'That was good. It\nshowed it quite nicely', and Daniel replied, 'Yeah, I would agree with that definitely'.\nStudents were asked about the activity that involved constructing scatter plots with\ndifferent correlations. Mark's comments concerning this activity were as follows:\nAgain you know the visual impact was good... I was probably being very linear because\nI knew that if you go from the corner up to the other corner forty-five degrees that was a\n1 on the correlation scale . . . so when they said sort of 0.8 I was trying to sort of drop it\ndown and have a linear thing. But I realised that that's not necessarily the case. You can\nstill have the plots scattered about . . . eventually I suppose it's an average isn't it? It's a\nmean, eventually, where it gives you the correlation figure. So that was a lesson to me if\nyou like.\nDaniel thought that the activity was 'good fun' and Anna commented, 'think it's a very\ngood practical. I think it helps to understand.'\nStudents' understanding of particular concepts concerning correlation were also\nconsidered when students were interviewed. Students were asked which of two\ncorrelations, 0.70 or -0.80, was stronger. Two of the pairs of students (Mark and Trudy,\nand Daniel and Alan) were correct in their agreement that the stronger correlation was\n-0.8. However, of the third pair of students, Anna said that 0.7 was stronger and Mary said\nthat -0.8 was stronger. They did not, however, consider or resolve this discrepancy.\nStudents were asked to arrange a set of correlations from the strongest to weakest\nrelationship. The pair Mark and Trudy and the pair Daniel and Alan correctly arranged\nthe correlations from the strongest to weakest relationship. Here, Mark's comments were\nappropriate: 'We just ignored the signs.' However, Mary said that she was confused when\nshe tried to complete the task with Anna, and Mary said that she 'Can't decide'. In spite of\nthis, this pair of students did correctly arrange the set of correlations.\nConclusions\nThe study described in this paper was designed to investigate whether learner activities in\nActivStats might affect students' understanding of correlation and to identify aspects of\nthis resource that students find valuable in terms of the learning process.\nComputer technology can be used to provide the student with multiple representations of\nstatistical concepts that are dynamically linked and offer immediate feedback to their\n88\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nresponses to learner activities. Research at the Open University has looked at how\ncomputer-based learning materials can be effectively designed and used to help psychology\nstudents come to understand statistical concepts that they find difficult (e.g., Morris, 1998).\nAs a development of this research work, a qualitative evaluation study of ActivStats was\ncarried out to see if particular learner activities in this multimedia resource might affect\nstudents' understanding of correlation.\nThe findings of the investigation suggest that the activity that involved students\nconstructing a series of scatter plots was beneficial for students' learning. On this activity,\nstudents took turns and commented on each others' actions. In addition, the activity\nallowed students to manipulate data points on a scatter plot and see the corresponding\nchange in the value of a correlation. During the activity, students also had the opportunity\nto predict that a particular pattern on a scatter plot would represent a particular value of a\ncorrelation coefficient. Moreover, by dragging data points on a scatter plot, students could\nsee the effect that outliers have on a correlation.\nThe use of multiple representations that are computationally linked in a computer-based\nlearning environment could have important implications in terms of students' learning. It\nis interesting to note that in Fox and Fowler's (1996) teaching experience students tend\nblindly to accept the calculated value of the correlation coefficient without considering\ngraphical evidence. Bivariate data should be plotted because isolated points or outliers and\nclusters of scores can have a powerful influence on the correlation coefficient and would\ntherefore misrepresent the underlying relationship between variables (see Hinton, 1995). In\naddition, bivariate data can show a curvilinear relationship, but Pearson correlation\ncoefficient, for example, will give a value of zero for the data, indicating no relationship.\nThe findings of the study suggest that students found it useful to adjust a scale that was\nlinked to a scatter plot, which meant that they could see how a correlation represented data\non a graph. However, this activity only involved students moving the sliding scale and they\ncould not directly change the scatter plot to see a corresponding change on the scale.\nThe findings of the interviews suggest that students thought that the program was useful\nfor learning about correlation. In particular, students thought that the use of scatter plots\nin ActivStats aided their understanding of correlation. For example, when asked about the\nconstructing scatter plots activity, Mark commented, 'again you know the visual impact\nwas good.' During the interviews the students were asked questions to find out about their\nunderstanding of the strength of correlations. With the exception of the third pair of\nstudents, all of the pairs of students correctly agreed that the correlation -0.8 was stronger\nthan the correlation 0.7. All three pairs of students correctly arranged the set of\ncorrelations from the strongest to weakest relationship.\nThis small-scale study of ActivStats provided valuable qualitative data on the process of\nlearning while students worked collaboratively on learning activities for correlation.\nHowever, from this qualitative study it is not possible to determine if the learner activities\nin ActivStats significantly contributed to students' understanding of correlation, or\naddressed particular learner misconceptions because pre- and-post tests were not\nemployed. However, by using an evaluation framework (Jones et al., 1996) that was used in\nthe summative evaluation of Link, further empirical work is being carried out with\nActivStats.\n89\nErica J.
