Disruption of circadian biology \nor sleep has profound metabolic consequences (1), which have lead to the \ndevelopment of a major research effort to understand the links between these \nprocesses.  By understanding the temporal regulation of metabolic physiology, it is \nanticipated that common behaviours and clinical interventions can be optimised to \nreduce the impact of modern society on the incidence of metabolic diseases, such as \ndiabetes. \n \nThere are clear links between circadian clocks and metabolism.  In mouse models, \ntransgenic disruption of key clock-related genes induces marked metabolic \nphenotypes (2-5).  In humans, chronic desynchrony of internal circadian time with the \nexternal environment (e.g. during shift work) correlates with increased incidence of \nobesity, type 2 diabetes and cardio-metabolic diseases (6).  Moreover, consistent with \nthe transgenic mouse data, recent work has linked polymorphisms of human circadian \nclock genes with metabolic dysfunction (7-9). \n \nThe mammalian circadian timing system consists of a \u2018master\u2019 clock within the \nsuprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus and a series of \u2018peripheral\u2019 clocks, \nwhich are located in extra-SCN regions of the brain as well as in almost all other \ntissues (10).  The environmental light-dark cycle synchronises the circadian system by \nacting through the SCN clock, which then maintains temporal order of the peripheral \nclocks via multiple rhythmic outputs (10).  These SCN-driven pathways include \n 4\nneuronal (e.g. sympathetic tone), endocrine (e.g. melatonin and cortisol secretion) and \nbehavioural (e.g. feeding) activity. \n \nMurine white adipose tissue (WAT), as with many other tissues, contains endogenous \ncircadian timing properties (11,12) and approximately 10-20% of the murine WAT \ntranscriptome is estimated to exhibit 24-hour variation (13,14).  Importantly, mice that \nare genetically susceptible to obesity and type 2 diabetes (15) or fed a high fat diet \n(16) exhibit reduced amplitude rhythms of gene expression in WAT, leading to the \nhypothesis that the robustness of WAT clocks is functionally associated with \nmetabolic phenotype. \n \nThis hypothesis has not been rigorously tested in humans.  The principal reason for \nthis important gap in our knowledge stems from the difficulty in obtaining multiple \nserial biopsies of tissue from human volunteers.  To date, the literature on rhythmic \ngene expression in human WAT has primarily relied on either analysis of single time \npoint biopsies maintained in culture (17), or the relative expression of genes at a \nsingle time point (18,19).  Clearly neither of these methods is ideal for the assessment \nof in vivo 24-hour rhythms. \n \nIn this study, serial human biopsies across a 24-hour cycle have been analysed using a \ncarefully controlled protocol designed to minimise the effect of confounding factors \non rhythmic physiology.  We have studied 3 defined groups of human volunteers to \ninvestigate daily WAT rhythms; lean individuals have been compared with subjects \nwho are overweight\/obese or overweight\/obese with type 2 diabetes. \n \n 5\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS \n \nAll aspects of the study were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of \nHelsinki and received a favourable ethical opinion from the Surrey Research Ethics \nCommittee and the University of Surrey Ethics Committee. \n \nParticipants.  Volunteers completed questionnaires to assess general health and \nensure normal sleep and diurnal preference.  They then attended a pre-screening \nsession at the University of Surrey, typically within 1 month of the laboratory session \nand during the early afternoon.  Body mass index (BMI, m2\/kg), waist circumference \nwere measured; fasting blood samples were provided for measurement of plasma \nHbA1c, insulin and glucose concentration, and homeostatic model assessment of \ninsulin resistance (HOMA-IR; calculated using HOMA Calculator v2.2 software, \nDiabetes Trial Unit, University of Oxford, UK). \n \n27 male volunteers were recruited; 8 lean, 11 overweight and 8 overweight with type \n2 diabetes.  Of the patients with type 2 diabetes, average time since diagnosis was 6.9 \n\u00b1 2.3 years; 3 were controlled by diet and exercise; the other 5 patients were treated \nwith combinations of metformin, statins, ramipril and lisinopril.  One participant \nwithin the lean group was a smoker, and was required to refrain from smoking for one \nweek prior to the study.  None of the participants had undertaken shift work within 5 \nyears of the study, nor crossed any time zones within one month of the study. \n \nFor 1 week prior to the laboratory study, volunteers were required to maintain \nprescribed daily feeding times and sleep-activity (sleep 22:30-06:30), which were \n 6\nmonitored using wrist actigraphy (AWL, Cambridge Neurotechnology, Cambridge \nUK), sleep diaries, food diaries and recorded messages on a laboratory time-stamped \nanswer phone.  Participants were also required to refrain from eating fatty or sugary \nfoods and drinking alcohol or caffeine throughout the week.  For the final three days \nof this baseline week, food was provided by the research team, to enable control of \ntimed behaviour, together with both the quantity and quality of nutrient intake.  \nDuring these three days, the daily caloric content of the supplied food was basal \nmetabolic rate x 1.5 with approximately 35% of energy from fat. \n \nLaboratory study.  All experimental procedures were carried out at the Surrey \nClinical Research Centre.  Volunteers arrived in the afternoon of day 0 for a night of \nadaptation.  Throughout the 2-day study, they were required to maintain a semi-\nrecumbent posture.  They were required to remain awake with lights-on between \n06:30-22:30 (440-825 lux in direction of gaze) and allowed to sleep with lights-off \nbetween 22:30-06:30 (0 lux).  During the waking period, participants were fed with \nhourly nutritional drinks (Fortisip; Nutricia, Schiphol, Netherlands) and were allowed \nto drink water ad libitum.  Daily energy intake was basal metabolic rate x 1.1, divided \nequally over the waking hours. \n \nFour subcutaneous WAT biopsies were taken under local anaesthetic (lidocaine) from \nfour different sites of the upper buttock region of each participant at 6-hourly intervals \nfor 24-hours, beginning at 10:30 on day 1.  The sampling order of the four biopsy \nsites was randomised between groups and subjects.  This WAT depot is known to \nexhibit metabolic activity (20). \n \n 7\nAnalysis of gene expression.  WAT biopsies were washed with saline and snap-\nfrozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at -800C.  Total RNA was extracted using \nTRIZOL, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  cDNA was synthesised and \nexpression was measured for genes integral to the circadian clock (PER1, PER2, \nPER3, CRY2, BMAL1, DBP) and involved in metabolic activity (REVERB\u03b1, RIP140, \nPGC1\u03b1) by quantitative Taqman real-time PCR as described previously (21).  Primer-\nprobe sets were designed in-house using Primer Express software (Table 1).  Standard \ncurves (R2 > 0.99) were generated using human genomic DNA (Promega Corporation, \nSouthampton, UK) and expression of all genes was normalised to GAPDH, as in \nprevious studies of adipose clock gene expression (15,16). \n \nStatistical analysis.  Pre-screen data were analysed using 1-way ANOVA with Tukey \npost-hoc test.  Correlation analyses were conducted using linear regression, and the \ngene expression time course from biopsies was performed using 1-way or 2-way \nrepeated measures ANOVA (factors time and group) with Tukey post-hoc test. \n 8\nRESULTS \n \nPre-screen data are shown in Table 2.  Despite efforts to age-match the participants, \nthere was a significant (P < 0.05) difference in age, with post-hoc analysis revealing a \nsignificant difference only between the overweight and type 2 diabetes groups.  \nHowever, subsequent analysis using age as a co-variant revealed that age per se did \nnot alter gene expression (data not shown).  There were significant (P < 0.05) \ndifferences in BMI, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose and insulin \nconcentrations, HbA1c levels and HOMA-IR, with highest values occurring in \nparticipants with type 2 diabetes.  There was no significant difference in plasma \ninsulin, glucose, HbA1c or HOMA-IR between lean and overweight\/obese groups, \nindicating that our overweight\/obese participants were insulin-sensitive. \n \nIn lean individuals, there was a significant (P < 0.05) effect of time on the expression \nof multiple genes involved in circadian (PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY2, BMAL1, DBP) \nand metabolic functions (REVERB\u03b1, RIP140, PGC1\u03b1) (Fig. 1).  Minimum expression \nof REVERB\u03b1 and DBP occurred around the middle to end of the afternoon.  In \nkeeping with circadian gene expression in other tissues (10), the phase of PER1, \nPER2, PER3 and CRY2 was slightly delayed compared to REVERB\u03b1 and DBP, with \nminimum expression occurring around the evening light-dark transition.  The BMAL1 \nrhythm was in approximate antiphase to the other circadian genes, with maximal \nexpression around the evening light-dark transition. \n \nAnalysis by 2-way repeated measures ANOVA of the data from all of the \nexperimental groups confirmed a significant (P < 0.05) effect of time on gene \n 9\nexpression (Fig. 2).  However, surprisingly, we did not observe a significant effect of \nexperimental group on the expression of any gene.   The only gene to exhibit a \nsignificant (P < 0.01) time x group interaction was BMAL1.  Tukey post-hoc analysis \nrevealed that BMAL1 expression 16.5 hours after lights-on (equivalent to clock time \n23:00) was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the overweight\/obese participants than in \nthe lean or type 2 diabetic groups. \n \n 10\nDISCUSSION \n \nConsistent with a previous study (22), our data reveal robust diurnal rhythmicity \nwithin human WAT in vivo.  To date, limited data have been published concerning \nclock gene expression in this tissue.  Due to difficulties in acquiring human tissue, \nsome studies have measured clock gene expression in WAT collected at a single time \npoint (18,19), although it is clearly difficult to infer rhythmical changes from such a \ntemporally limited data set.  An elegant compromise has been to culture explants of \ntissue taken at a single time point and then measure gene expression in fragments of \nthe biopsies over a 24-hour time course (17).  Although such studies highlight \nendogenous WAT rhythms, they do not reflect gene expression in vivo.  We therefore \nmeasured gene expression in human tissue explants harvested across a whole 24-hour \ncycle to provide in vivo human WAT rhythms. \n \nAnimal models suggest that obesity and type 2 diabetes reduce rhythm amplitude in \nmurine WAT, as lean C57BL\/6J mice exhibit higher amplitude WAT rhythms than \nobese\/diabetic KK and KK-Ay mice (15).  Other data revealed reduced amplitude \nrhythms in mice that have become obese due to a high-fat diet (16).  However, Ando \net al (15) compared mice with differing genetic backgrounds, which complicate \ninterpretation of their data, and it is possible that dietary intervention could directly \nregulate gene expression rather than obesity per se. \n \nIn contrast to the above studies, we observed minimal differences between clock gene \nrhythms in human WAT.  Interpretation of the minor difference in BMAL1 expression \nis not clear; although mouse Bmal1 has been implicated in the control of adipogenesis \n 11\nin vitro (23), juvenile Bmal1-\/- mice develop adipose depots comparably to their wild \ntype litter mates (24).  Furthermore, the similarity between gene expression profiles in \nlean individuals and those overweight with type 2 diabetes suggests that BMI is not \nthe cause of the time x group interaction for BMAL1 in the overweight, non-diabetic \nindividuals. \n \nThe similarity of gene expression profiles between our experimental groups may \npartly result from a lack of extreme phenotypic differences.  Although there was not a \nlarge disparity in BMI between our groups, all participants fell into the current clinical \nguidelines for lean\/healthy, obese and type 2 diabetic individuals.  There was \ntherefore no effect of obesity or type 2 diabetes per se on human WAT rhythmicity.  \nIt remains possible that severely obese individuals may exhibit reduced amplitude \nWAT rhythmicity; however, interpretation of data from such individuals is \ncomplicated by various confounding factors, such as co-morbidities associated with \ntype 2 diabetes. \n \nAnother difference between our study and previous work (25) is the high level of \nglycaemic control in our participants.  We specifically aimed to investigate the \nrelationship between WAT rhythmicity, body weight and presence of type 2 diabetes.  \nWe therefore eliminated as many additional factors as possible.  Diurnal adipose gene \nexpression may be modulated by the level of glycaemic control and\/or drugs taken by \ndiabetic individuals.  Alternatively, the association between metabolic state and WAT \nrhythmicity might vary between adipose depots.  However, due to limitations of \nsampling and experimental group size, we could not directly address these \npossibilities in the current study. \n 12\n The persistence of 24-hour rhythms in WAT from patients with type 2 diabetes now \nsuggests that the link between human circadian and metabolic physiology occurs \noutside of WAT, at least in the earlier stages of the disease. \n 13\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \nD.T.O. researched data and reviewed\/edited the manuscript.
