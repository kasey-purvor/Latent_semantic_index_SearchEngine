For example, these can be regulated by\nepidermal growth factor (EGF) [6,7], basic fibroblast\ngrowth factor (FGF2) [8,9], and transforming growth fac-\ntor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) [10]. However, the influences acting on\nthese stem and progenitor cells during development of the\nbrain in vivo have not been characterised in any detail. It\nis likely that they are carried within the cerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) [11] which contains large quantities of proteins\nincluding growth factors during development, in contrast\nto trace levels in adult CSF [12]. Historically, CSF studied\nin the context of the adult brain, has been associated with\nmechanical functions and some simple physiological\nfunctions, but it is becoming increasingly clear that the\ncerebrospinal fluid has a much more critical physiological\nrole [13-15], particularly during development.\nCSF is present from the early stages of neural tube devel-\nopment through to adult brain. In the early stages of brain\ndevelopment, cells within the ependymal lining of the\nneural tube are thought to secrete CSF. As the neural tube\ncloses, a membrane formed from these cells invaginates to\nform the frond-like structures of the choroid plexus. This\nstructure continues to secrete CSF throughout life. There is\na developmental sequence in the appearance of the\nchoroid plexus beginning with the 4th ventricle plexus\nfollowed by its appearance in the lateral and finally the\nthird ventricles [16]. This sequence correlates with the\nlater development of the cerebral cortex from germinal\nmatrix cells, adjacent to the lateral ventricles. Thus a major\ncomponent of the environment of germinal matrix stem\nand progenitor cells of the developing cortex, is the CSF\nsystem, known to contain growth factors secreted by the\nchoroid plexus [17,18]. This may be particularly impor-\ntant in the period before vascularisation. However, it may\nbe significant that the CSF remains adjacent to the germi-\nnal layer (and also the marginal zone) of the cortex\nthroughout development and in later life.\nEarly experiments on chick embryos, involving CSF drain-\nage, suggested that the CSF is important for the normal\ndevelopment of spinal cord and later development of the\ncortex [19,20]. In fact in cases where the flow of CSF is\nabnormal, for example through loss (e.g. spina bifida) or\nblockage (e.g. hydrocephalus), there is an associated\nabnormality in the development of the central nervous\nsystem (CNS), particularly of the cerebral cortex [11,15].\nIn the case of hydrocephalus, work with rat models of this\ncondition points to a critical role of CSF in maintaining\nthe normal proliferation of the stem cells in the develop-\ning cortex [13,14].\nAll these studies suggest that CSF is an important carrier of\nnutrients and factors involved in controlling and coordi-\nnating the progress of development of the CNS [11]. In\nthis paper we have studied cortical cell proliferation in vivo\nusing bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining of tissue sec-\ntions and have used in vitro assays to assess the ability of\nCSF to support cortical cell proliferation, focusing on the\ncritical stages of development.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals\nAll experiments were sanctioned by the Home Office Ani-\nmal Procedures Inspectorate. The Wistar rat colony was\nstarted from breeding pairs purchased from Charles River\n(UK). These were maintained as non-SPF on a 12:12 h\nlight dark cycle beginning at 8.00 am. They were kept at a\nconstant temperature with unrestricted access to food and\nwater. The colony was maintained through random pair\nmating. Timed mating was carried out by placing a male\nand female together and checking for the presence of a\nvaginal plug every 4 h. The presence of a plug was taken to\nindicate successful mating and the time taken as gesta-\ntional day zero, E0. Fetuses from timed pregnancies of\nWistar rats were harvested after euthanasia of the mother,\nby intraperitoneal injection of an overdose of anaesthetic\n(sodium pentobarbitone), at gestation days, E17-E20 and\nbrains were removed and processed as described below.\nStaining and immunocytochemical analysis of tissue \nsections\nFor histological analysis, brains were fixed in 4% parafor-\nmaldehyde for a minimum of 2 h, cryopreserved in 20%\nsucrose, and frozen in iso-pentane cooled with dry ice.\nSerial coronal sections, 20\u00b5m-thick, were obtained with a\nLeica CM cryostat and stained with haematoxylin and\neosin.\nTo identify proliferating cells, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine\n(BrdU, Sigma, Poole, UK) was administered to pregnant\ndams by intraperitoneal injection at a dosage of 60 mg\/kg\nat E17. Fetuses were then recovered at E18-E21, after BrdU\ninjection of their dams, and the heads fixed in ice cold 4%\nparaformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at\npH 7.3. Fixation was carried out for a minimum of 2 h and\nusually overnight. Coronal sections were incubated in\n10% normal serum in PBS for 2 h prior to flooding with\nprimary antibody, a mouse anti-BrdU antibody (Nova\nCastro Laboratories, Newcastle UK), diluted 1:1000 in\n10% normal serum in PBS, overnight at 4\u00b0C. Sections\nwere then washed in PBS (3 \u00d7 1 h) and flooded with sec-\nondary antibody, universal biotinylated horse anti-rabbit-\nanti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories Ltd,\nPeterborough UK), at a dilution of 1:200 in 10% normal\nserum in PBS for 2\u20134 h. Visualisation was by avidin-\nbiotin-peroxidase diaminobenzidine staining (VectorPage 2 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nCerebrospinal Fluid Research 2006, 3:2 http:\/\/www.cerebrospinalfluidresearch.com\/content\/3\/1\/2Elite ABC Kits). All stained sections were mounted in glyc-\nerin-albumin and images were captured using a Coolsnap\ndigital camera (Princeton Instruments) fitted to a Leica\nDMLB microscope. Image-capture and analysis was car-\nried out using Metaview software (Universal Imaging Cor-\nporation). Different regions of the coronal cortical\nsection, the germinal matrix, the intermediate zone and\nthe cortical plate, were identified and the number of pos-\nitive cells in each zone was counted on a photomontages\nconstructed from micrographs taken at x400 magnifica-\ntion across the cortex. These gave a strip of cortex 400\u00b5m\nwide from the ventricular ependymal layer to the surface\nof the cortex next to the pia.\nIn all experiments, a minimum of three measurements\n(BrdU positive cell counts in the region of the cortex\nunder analysis) was taken for each individual to give an\naverage for each zone for that individual. These averages\nfrom at least four separate fetuses from separate litters\nwere pooled to give a mean \u00b1 SEM.\nPreparation of cell cultures\nCortical hemispheres from the brains of embryonic rats at\nE17-E20 were used to prepare primary cell cultures. 4\u20136\nhemispheres were cleared of meninges and incubated in\ntrypsin-EDTA solution (0.25%) at 37\u00b0C for 20 min. The\nsolution was replaced with Neurobasal medium (Invitro-\ngen, Paisley, UK) and the cells dissociated by repetitive\npipetting through tips of decreasing bore size. The suspen-\nsion was centrifuged at 1700 rpm for 5 min and the super-\nnatant replaced with fresh media. Further pipetting was\nperformed to break up clusters of cells before a sample\nwas taken for viability staining with trypan blue (0.4%)\nand cell counting. The dissociated cells were plated in\npoly-D-lysine (0.05 mg\/ml) coated 96 well plates at a den-\nsity of 1 \u00d7 105 cells\/ml in Neurobasal medium which pref-\nerentially supports progenitor and neuronal cell types\n(not glial cells), containing B27 supplement (Invitrogen),\n2 mM glutamine and penicillin-streptomycin (0.1 mg\/\nml). At 24 h the media was replaced with 50 \u00b5l fresh Neu-\nrobasal medium (media only) or, alternatively, cells were\nincubated in 50 \u00b5l 100% CSF from different age sources\n(as indicated in the figure legends) and the cultures were\nmaintained at 37\u00b0C in a 5 % CO2 atmosphere for a further\n48 h.\nProliferation assay\nCell proliferation was determined using the lumines-\ncence-based Lumitech Vialight (LumiTech Ltd, Notting-\nham UK) high sensitivity cell proliferation and\ncytotoxicity assay kit (as per manufacturers instructions),\nwhich is based on the measurement of concentrations of\nATP in the culture. Analysis of the luminescence reading\nobtained against known viable cell numbers for cortical\ncells from fetuses showed that the assay is linear for cell\nnumbers up to 1 million cells\/well. This assay can detect\nas few as 100 viable cells in the culture and thus is highly\nsensitive in comparison with other methods for determin-\ning the number of cells within a culture. It measures cells\nthat have actually completed division, unlike alternative\nmethods, which measure incorporation of nucleotides\ninto DNA. Measurements were made on a Multilabel\nCounter (Wallac Victor2 1420, PerkinElmer, UK). Lumi-\nnescence measurements were taken from control wells\nplated at the initiation of the culture and assayed immedi-\nately. These give control day zero luminescence readings.\nResults are expressed as fold of this day zero measure-\nment, mean +\/- SEM of at least three experiments involv-\ning at least three litters, each performed in triplicate.\nDevelopment of the cortical zones between E17\u201320Figure 1\nDevelopment of the cortical zones between E17\u201320.

This CSF was added to\nthe cultures as shown. The cisterna magna is an excellent\nsite to collect uncontaminated CSF since the fluid space is\nlarge and access is through a thin membrane once the\noverlying musculature has been dissected. Occasional\ncontamination with blood was caused by severing a blood\nvessel within the cisternal cavity and these samples were\ndiscarded. All samples were collected into sterile Eppen-\ndorf tubes and routinely centrifuged twice at 14,000 rpm\nto remove any cells or debris from the fluid, which was\ndecanted into another sterile tube. Samples were frozen\non dry ice and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Between 5 and\n50\u00b5l of CSF was collected from each fetus using this\nmethod and CSF from individual litters was pooled for\nthe experiments.\nResults\nAnalysis of the changes in cortical morphology in \ndevelopment\nThe rat cortex (or more accurately the cortical plate)\nappears over days E17-E21. In order to examine this devel-\nopment in more detail, we analysed photomicrographs of\nsections through the cortex across this time scale. There\nwas some increase in total thickness from E17 to E20 and\na rapid appearance of cortical plate over the first 48 h (Fig.\n1), demonstrating that this is a critical period in the gen-\neration and migration of the neurones of the cortex from\nthe germinal epithelium through the intermediate zone\ninto the cortical plate. By E19 the cortical plate was well\nestablished and the thickness of the germinal epithelium\nappeared to decline as the mass of migrating neurones left\nthe intermediate zone (Fig. 1).\nIn vitro proliferation of cortical cells extracted from E17\u201320Figure 3\nIn vitro proliferation of cortical cells extracted from E17\u201320. \nCortical cells were incubated in supplemented Neurobasal \nmedium.

Cells generated on E17\nwere present in the germinal matrix and intermediate\nzone on E18, began to move into the cortical plate by E19,\nand were more concentrated in the cortical plate by E20\nand E21 (Figs. 2A and 2B).\nProliferation of primary cortical cells in Neurobasal \nmedium\nCortical germinal epithelial (GE) cells are usually main-\ntained in vitro in a specialised Neurobasal medium con-\ntaining B27 supplement (Invitrogen, Paisley UK), which\npreferentially supports the growth of progenitor and neu-\nronal cell types by enhanced proliferation and self-\nrenewal [2,5,21]. Histological analysis as shown in Fig. 1,\nsuggests that it is important to consider the exact age of\nthe cells at extraction, since the apparent rate of prolifera-\ntion changes over a single day, implying that the response\nprofile of the primary cells derived from these time points\nwould be different. The growth of E17 \u2013 E20 cells (the\ndays known to be critical for cortical development in the\nembryonic rat) in Neurobasal media is compared in Fig.\n3. There was a time window over days E18 and E19 of ges-\ntation where the cells exhibited a large significant, prolif-\nerative response (P < 0.001 compared to time zero sample\nas analysed by Students t test). In contrast on either side\nof this time window, on days E17 and E20, the prolifera-\ntion of the cells under these conditions was minimal and\nonly significant at E17 (P < 0.05).\nEffects of CSF from different gestational ages on viability \nand proliferation\nThe above experiments show that there was an age-related\nvariation in the ability of primary cortical cells to prolifer-\nate and that this has at least two important components,\nan age-related proliferation potential presumably dictated\nby developmental genes, and their in vivo environment\nwhich provides the support required for growth, prolifer-\nation, differentiation and migration.\nBased on previous work pointing to a role for CSF in cor-\ntical development, we examined whether the cultured cor-\ntical cells from different fetal stages could be maintained\nin CSF alone. Primary cortical cells were taken from E17\nand E19 fetuses whilst CSF was collected from fetal brains\naged E18 through to E21. The medium was completely\nreplaced by CSF such that cells were incubated in 100%\nCSF. In all cases CSF was able to maintain the E19 cells in\na viable state (Fig. 4). In fact not only was cell viability\nmaintained, but cells also proliferated in the CSF to an\nextent comparable to, or, in excess of, that observed with\nnormal Neurobasal medium (Fig. 4). The response of the\nE17 cells was significantly reduced compared to the E19\ncells but even with these cells, the CSF was able to main-\ntain cell viability over the 72 h period. The only exception\nto this was E21 CSF, which was unable to support the sur-\nvival of E17 cells, a perhaps not unexpected result given\nthe temporal separation between these two components\nof the developing cortex in vivo.\nTogether these data illustrate that CSF alone is able to\nfunction as a medium for survival and proliferation of\ndeveloping cortical cells in vitro and that CSF composition\nchanges with time as reflected in its changing ability to\nsupport viability and proliferation.\nDiscussion\nThe data presented here show that the in vitro proliferative\npotential of primary cells derived from the developing cer-\nebral cortex of rats was dependent upon the age of extrac-\ntion. As well as highlighting the necessity for careful age\nmatching of cell samples taken from the developing cor-\ntex, these experiments also pointed to the ability of the\nCSF to function as a physiological medium for the growth\nof germinal epithelium stem and progenitor cells. The CSF\nwas able to maintain viability of the cortical epithelial\ncells and stimulate their proliferation. In fact, given that at\nthe early stages of development the cortical epithelium\ncontains only germinal matrix stem cells, it is highly likely\nEffect of CSF on the in vitro proliferation of cortical cellsFigure 4\nEffect of CSF on the in vitro proliferation of cortical cells. \nCortical cell cultures from E17 (red) or E19 (yellow) Wistar \nrat brains were incubated in either supplemented Neuroba-\nsal medium (control) or 100% CSF from E18, E19, E20 or \nE21 fetal brains and proliferation assessed by luminescence \nassay.

As the neural tube closes, the choroid\nplexus is formed and this structure then continues to\nsecrete CSF throughout life. In addition to the secreted\nCSF, there are significant contributions of fluid and com-\nponents from the bulk flow of interstitial fluid from the\nbrain parenchyma thought to be up to 15\u201320% of the\ntotal volume of CSF. Thus a major component of the envi-\nronment of germinal matrix stem and progenitor cells of\nthe developing cortex is the CSF and, as shown here, this\nfluid can support the viability and proliferative potential\nof these cells as they pass through the developmental pro-\ngramme associated with formation of the cerebral cortex.\nSince many of the growth factors important to develop-\nment of the cortex are known to be secreted by the\nchoroid plexus directly into the CSF [17,18], it is not\nunreasonable to conclude that the CSF is vital to the\ndevelopmental process. Of course, the cells in vivo will\nexperience additional influences through contact with\nother cells and locally secreted factors, most notably from\nglial cells. Further support for the critical role of CSF\ncomes from the recent work by Gato and colleagues [23].\nThey demonstrated that slices of developing chick brain\nwere incapable of supporting neurogenesis or migration\nof neurones from the germinal epithelium unless CSF was\nadded to the growth medium. This suggests that, rather\nthan the critical growth factors being produced in the local\nmicroenvironment of the brain, the surrounding CSF is\nsufficient to drive the developmental process.\nAnother aspect of CSF function is its flow pathway. Corti-\ncal development coincides with the opening of the\nforamen of Luschka and Magendie at E17 and the conse-\nquent flow of CSF from the ventricular system into the\nsubarachnoid spaces [11]. This may be related to a need\nfor signals (e.g. BDNF) [24,25] to reach the pial menin-\ngeal cells to initiate and promote reelin output from Cajal-\nRetzius cells in the marginal zone. During this critical\nperiod of development Saunders and colleagues [26,27]\nhave shown the presence of an ependymal barrier to free\nmovement of fluid through to the brain parenchyma from\nthe CSF, in the later stages of gestation from E16 through\nto birth. This ensures that the CSF only reaches the pial\nmeningeal cells after the foramina of Luschka and Magen-\ndie open [28]. There is a strong correlation between this\nopening of the foramina and triggering of normal migra-\ntion of neurones and stratification of the cortex [29-34].\nIn spina bifida aperta, where CSF can fail to enter the sub-\narachnoid space, cortical development is severely affected\n[15]. In early-onset hydrocephalus, where CSF flow is\nobstructed at this critical period of cortical development,\ncortical development is also severely affected [13,14].\nConclusion\nThe data presented here along with the evidence from the\nstudies discussed above, implicates the CSF as an impor-\ntant element in the development of the central nervous\nsystem, and specifically of the cerebral cortex.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nPJOL conceived and designed the study, analysed and\ninterpreted all the data and drafted\/re-wrote the manu-\nscript.
